The format and content\r\nof the former entries on the Environment have been changed, and two new\r\nappendixes have been added--Appendix D: Abbreviations for Selected International\r\nEnvironmental Agreements and Appendix E:  Selected International Environmental\r\nAgreements. The name of Macedonia was changed to The Former Yugoslav Republic of\r\nMacedonia (FYROM). The gross domestic product (GDP) of most of the developing\r\ncountries is now presented on a purchasing power parity (PPP) basis rather than\r\non an exchange rate basis. The electronic files used to produce the Factbook\r\nhave been restructured into a database. As a result, the formats of some entries\r\nin this edition have been changed. Additional changes will occur in the 1995\r\nFactbook.\r\n\r\nAbbreviations: (see Appendix B for abbreviations for international organizations\r\nand groups and Appendix D for abbreviations for international environmental\r\nagreements)\r\n\r\navdp. -- avoirdupois\r\n\r\nc.i.f. -- cost, insurance, and freight\r\n\r\nCY -- calendar year\r\n\r\nDWT -- deadweight ton\r\n\r\nest. -- estimate\r\n\r\nEx-Im -- Export-Import Bank of the United States\r\n\r\nf.o.b. -- free on board\r\n\r\nFRG -- Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany); used for information dated\r\nbefore 3 October 1990 or CY91\r\n\r\nFSU -- former Soviet Union\r\n\r\nFY -- fiscal year\r\n\r\nFYROM -- The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia\r\n\r\nGDP -- gross domestic product\r\n\r\nGDR -- German Democratic Republic (East Germany); used for information dated\r\nbefore 3 October 1990 or CY91\r\n\r\nGNP -- gross national product\r\n\r\nGRT -- gross register ton\r\n\r\nGWP -- gross world product\r\n\r\nkm -- kilometer\r\n\r\nkW -- kilowatt\r\n\r\nkWh -- kilowatt hour\r\n\r\nm -- meter\r\n\r\nNA -- not available\r\n\r\nNEGL -- negligible\r\n\r\nnm -- nautical mile\r\n\r\nNZ -- New Zealand\r\n\r\nODA -- official development assistance\r\n\r\nOOF -- other official flows\r\n\r\nPDRY -- People's Democratic Republic of Yemen [Yemen (Aden) or South Yemen];\r\nused for information dated before 22 May 1990 or CY91\r\n\r\nsq km -- square kilometer\r\n\r\nsq mi -- square mile\r\n\r\nUAE -- United Arab Emirates\r\n\r\nUK -- United Kingdom\r\n\r\nUS -- United States\r\n\r\nUSSR -- Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (Soviet Union); used for information\r\ndated before 25 December 1991\r\n\r\nYAR -- Yemen Arab Republic [Yemen (Sanaa) or North Yemen]; used for information\r\ndated before 22 May 1990 or CY91\r\n\r\nAdministrative divisions: The numbers, designatory terms, and first-order\r\nadministrative divisions are generally those approved by the US Board on\r\nGeographic Names (BGN). Changes that have been reported but not yet acted on by\r\nBGN are noted.\r\n\r\nArea: Total area is the sum of all land and water areas delimited by\r\ninternational boundaries and/or coastlines. Land area is the aggregate of all\r\nsurfaces delimited by international boundaries and/or coastlines, excluding\r\ninland water bodies (lakes, reservoirs, rivers). Comparative areas are based on\r\ntotal area equivalents. Most entities are compared with the entire US or one of\r\nthe 50 states. The smaller entities are compared with Washington, DC (178 sq km,\r\n69 sq mi) or The Mall in Washington, DC (0.59 sq km, 0.23 sq mi, 146 acres).\r\n\r\nBirth rate: The average annual number of births during a year per 1,000\r\npopulation at midyear; also known as crude birth rate.\r\n\r\nDates of information: In general, information available as of 1 January 1994 was\r\nused in the preparation of this edition. Population figures are estimates for 1\r\nJuly 1994, with population growth rates estimated for calendar year 1994. Major\r\npolitical events have been updated through May 1994.\r\n\r\nDeath rate: The average annual number of deaths during a year per l,000\r\npopulation at midyear; also known as crude death rate.\r\n\r\nDigraphs: The digraph is a two-letter \"country code\" that precisely identifies\r\nevery entity without overlap, duplication, or omission. AF, for example, is the\r\ndigraph for Afghanistan. It is a standardized geopolitical data element\r\npromulgated in the  Federal Information Processing Standards Publication (FIPS)\r\n10-3 by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (US Department of\r\nCommerce) and maintained by the Office of the Geographer (US Department of\r\nState). The digraph is used to eliminate confusion and incompatibility in the\r\ncollection, processing, and dissemination of area-specific data and is\r\nparticularly useful for interchanging data between databases.\r\n\r\nDiplomatic representation: The US Government has diplomatic relations with 183\r\nnations, including 177 of the 184 UN members (excluded UN members are Bhutan,\r\nCuba, Iran, Iraq, North Korea, Vietnam, and former Yugoslavia). In addition, the\r\nUS has diplomatic relations with 6 nations that are not in the UN - Holy See,\r\nKiribati, Nauru, Switzerland, Tonga, and Tuvalu.\r\n\r\nEconomic aid: This entry refers to bilateral commitments of official development\r\nassistance (ODA) and other official flows (OOF). ODA is defined as financial\r\nassistance which is concessional in character, has the main objective to promote\r\neconomic development and welfare of LDCs. and contains a grant element of at\r\nleast 25%. OOF transactions are also official government assistance, but with a\r\nmain objective other than development and with a grant element less than 25%.\r\nOOF transactions include official export credits (such as Ex-Im Bank credits),\r\nofficial equity and portfolio investment, and debt reorganization by the\r\nofficial sector that does not meet concessional terms. Aid is considered to have\r\nbeen committed when agreements are initialed by the parties involved and\r\nconstitute a formal declaration of intent.\r\n\r\nEntities: Some of the nations, dependent areas, areas of special sovereignty,\r\nand governments included in this publication are not independent, and others are\r\nnot officially recognized by the US Government. \"Nation\" refers to a people\r\npolitically organized into a sovereign state with a definite territory.\r\n\"Dependent area\" refers to a broad category of political entities that are\r\nassociated in some way with a nation. Names used for page headings are usually\r\nthe short-form names as approved by the US Board on Geographic Names. There are\r\n266 entities in The World Factbook that may be categorized as follows:\r\n\r\nNATIONS\r\n\r\n183 -- UN members (excluding both the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia\r\nand the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia; membership status in the UN is still to\r\nbe determined)\r\n\r\n7 -- nations that are not members of the UN--Holy See, Kiribati, Nauru, Serbia\r\nand Montenegro, Switzerland, Tonga, Tuvalu\r\n\r\nOTHER\r\n\r\n1 -- Taiwan\r\n\r\nDEPENDENT AREAS\r\n\r\n6 -- Australia--Ashmore and Cartier Islands, Christmas Island, Cocos (Keeling)\r\nIslands, Coral Sea Islands, Heard Island and McDonald Islands, Norfolk Island\r\n\r\n2 -- Denmark--Faroe Islands, Greenland\r\n\r\n16 -- France--Bassas da India, Clipperton Island, Europa Island, French Guiana,\r\nFrench Polynesia, French Southern and Antarctic Lands, Glorioso Islands,\r\nGuadeloupe, Juan de Nova Island, Martinique, Mayotte, New Caledonia, Reunion,\r\nSaint Pierre and Miquelon, Tromelin Island, Wallis and Futuna\r\n\r\n2 -- Netherlands--Aruba, Netherlands Antilles\r\n\r\n3 -- New Zealand--Cook Islands, Niue, Tokelau\r\n\r\n3 -- Norway--Bouvet Island, Jan Mayen, Svalbard\r\n\r\n1 -- Portugal--Macau\r\n\r\n16 -- United Kingdom--Anguilla, Bermuda, British Indian Ocean Territory, British\r\nVirgin Islands, Cayman Islands, Falkland Islands, Gibraltar, Guernsey, Hong\r\nKong, Jersey, Isle of Man, Montserrat, Pitcairn Islands, Saint Helena, South\r\nGeorgia and the South Sandwich Islands, Turks and Caicos Islands\r\n\r\n15 -- United States--American Samoa, Baker Island, Guam, Howland Island, Jarvis\r\nIsland, Johnston Atoll, Kingman Reef, Midway Islands, Navassa Island, Northern\r\nMariana Islands, Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands (Palau), Palmyra Atoll,\r\nPuerto Rico, Virgin Islands, Wake Island\r\n\r\nMISCELLANEOUS\r\n\r\n6 -- Antarctica, Gaza Strip, Paracel Islands, Spratly Islands, West Bank,\r\nWestern Sahara\r\n\r\nOTHER ENTITIES\r\n\r\n4 -- oceans--Arctic Ocean, Atlantic Ocean, Indian Ocean, Pacific Ocean\r\n\r\n1 -- World\r\n\r\n266 -- total\r\n\r\nExchange rate: The value of a nation's monetary unit at a given date or over a\r\ngiven period of time, as expressed in units of local currency per US dollar and\r\nas determined by international market forces or official fiat.\r\n\r\nGross domestic product (GDP): The value of all final goods and services produced\r\nwithin a nation in a given year.\r\n\r\nGross national product (GNP): The value of all final goods and services produced\r\nwithin a nation in a given year, plus income earned abroad, minus income earned\r\nby foreigners from domestic production.\r\n\r\nGross world product (GWP): The aggregate value of all goods and services\r\nproduced worldwide in a given year.\r\n\r\nGNP/GDP methodology: In the \"Economy\" section, GNP/GDP dollar estimates for the\r\ngreat majority of countries are derived from purchasing power parity (PPP)\r\ncalculations rather than from conversions at official currency exchange rates.\r\nThe PPP method normally involves the use of international dollar price weights,\r\nwhich are applied to the quantities of goods and services produced in a given\r\neconomy. In addition to the lack of reliable data from the majority of\r\ncountries, the statistician faces a major difficulty in specifying, identifying,\r\nand allowing for the quality of goods and services. The division of a GNP/GDP\r\nestimate in local currency by the corresponding PPP estimate in dollars gives\r\nthe PPP conversion rate. On average, one thousand dollars will buy the same\r\nmarket basket of goods in the US as one thousand dollars--converted to the local\r\ncurrency at the PPP conversion rate--will buy in the other country.  Whereas PPP\r\nestimates for OECD countries are quite reliable, PPP estimates for developing\r\ncountries are often rough approximations.  The latter estimates are based on\r\nextrapolation of numbers published by the UN International Comparison Program\r\nand by Professors Robert Summers and Alan Heston of the University of\r\nPennsylvania and their colleagues.  Because currency exchange rates depend on a\r\nvariety of international and domestic financial forces that often have little\r\nrelation to domestic output, use of these rates is less satisfactory for\r\ncalculating GNP/GDP than the PPP method.  In developing countries with weak\r\ncurrencies the exchange rate estimate of GNP/GDP in dollars is typically one-\r\nfourth to one-half the PPP estimate.  Furthermore, exchange rates may suddenly\r\ngo up or down by 10% or more because of market forces or official fiat whereas\r\nreal output has remained unchanged.  On 12 January 1994, for example, the 14\r\ncountries of the African Financial Community (whose currencies are tied to the\r\nFrench franc) devalued their currencies by 50%.  This move, of course, did not\r\ncut the real output of these countries by half.  One additional caution: the\r\nproportion of, say, defense expenditures as a percent of GNP/GDP in local\r\ncurrency accounts may differ substantially from the proportion when GNP/GDP\r\naccounts are expressed in PPP terms, as, for example, when an observer estimates\r\nthe dollar level of Russian or Japanese military expenditures;\r\n\r\nGrowth rate (population): The annual percent change in the population, resulting\r\nfrom a surplus (or deficit) of births over deaths and the balance of migrants\r\nentering and leaving a country. The rate may be positive or negative.\r\n\r\nIllicit drugs: There are five categories of illicit drugs--narcotics,\r\nstimulants, depressants (sedatives), hallucinogens, and cannabis. These\r\ncategories include many drugs legally produced and prescribed by doctors as well\r\nas those illegally produced and sold outside medical channels.\r\n\r\nCannabis (Cannabis sativa) is the common hemp plant, which provides\r\nhallucinogens with some sedative properties, and includes marijuana (pot,\r\nAcapulco gold, grass, reefer), tetrahydrocannabinol (THC, Marinol), hashish\r\n(hash), and hashish oil (hash oil).\r\n\r\nCoca (Erythroxylon coca) is a bush, and the leaves contain the stimulant\r\ncocaine. Coca is not to be confused with cocoa, which comes from cacao seeds and\r\nis used in making chocolate, cocoa, and cocoa butter.\r\n\r\nCocaine is a stimulant derived from the leaves of the coca bush.\r\n\r\nDepressants (sedatives) are drugs that reduce tension and anxiety and include\r\nchloral hydrate, barbiturates (Amytal, Nembutal, Seconal, phenobarbital),\r\nbenzodiazepines (Librium, Valium), methaqualone (Quaalude), glutethimide\r\n(Doriden), and others (Equanil, Placidyl, Valmid).\r\n\r\nDrugs are any chemical substances that effect a physical, mental, emotional, or\r\nbehavioral change in an individual.\r\n\r\nDrug abuse is the use of any licit or illicit chemical substance that results in\r\nphysical, mental, emotional, or behavioral impairment in an individual.\r\n\r\nHallucinogens are drugs that affect sensation, thinking, self-awareness, and\r\nemotion. Hallucinogens include LSD (acid, microdot), mescaline and peyote (mexc,\r\nbuttons, cactus), amphetamine variants (PMA, STP, DOB), phencyclidine (PCP,\r\nangel dust, hog), phencyclidine analogues (PCE, PCPy, TCP), and others\r\n(psilocybin, psilocyn).\r\n\r\nHashish is the resinous exudate of the cannabis or hemp plant (Cannabis sativa).\r\n\r\nHeroin is a semisynthetic derivative of morphine.\r\n\r\nMandrax is a synthetic chemical depressant, the same as, or similar to Quaalude.\r\n\r\nMarijuana is the dried leaves of the cannabis or hemp plant (Cannabis sativa).\r\n\r\nNarcotics are drugs that relieve pain, often induce sleep, and refer to opium,\r\nopium derivatives, and synthetic substitutes. Natural narcotics include opium\r\n(paregoric, parepectolin), morphine (MS-Contin, Roxanol), codeine (Tylenol with\r\ncodeine, Empirin with codeine, Robitussan AC), and thebaine. Semisynthetic\r\nnarcotics include heroin (horse, smack), and hydromorphone (Dilaudid). Synthetic\r\nnarcotics include meperidine or Pethidine (Demerol, Mepergan), methadone\r\n(Dolophine, Methadose), and others (Darvon, Lomotil).\r\n\r\nOpium is the milky exudate of the incised, unripe seedpod of the opium poppy.\r\n\r\nOpium poppy (Papaver somniferum) is the source for many natural and\r\nsemisynthetic narcotics.\r\n\r\nPoppy straw concentrate is the alkaloid derived from the mature dried opium\r\npoppy.\r\n\r\nQat (kat, khat) is a stimulant from the buds or leaves of catha edulis that is\r\nchewed or drunk as tea.\r\n\r\nStimulants are drugs that relieve mild depression, increase energy and activity,\r\nand include cocaine (coke, snow, crack), amphetamines (Desoxyn, Dexedrine),\r\nphenmetrazine (Preludin), methylphenidate (Ritalin), and others (Cylert,\r\nSanorex, Tenuate).\r\n\r\nInfant mortality rate: The number of deaths to infants under one year old in a\r\ngiven year per l,000 live births occurring in the same year.\r\n\r\nInternational disputes: This category includes a wide variety of situations that\r\nrange from traditional bilateral boundary disputes to unilateral claims of one\r\nsort or another. Information regarding disputes over international boundaries\r\nand maritime boundaries has been reviewed by the Department of State. References\r\nto other situations involving borders or frontiers may also be included, such as\r\nresource disputes, geopolitical questions, or irredentist issues. However,\r\ninclusion does not necessarily constitute official acceptance or recognition by\r\nthe US Government.\r\n\r\nIrrigated land: The figure refers to the land area that is artificially supplied\r\nwith water.\r\n\r\nLand use: Human use of the land surface is categorized as arable land--land\r\ncultivated for crops that are replanted after each harvest (wheat, maize, rice);\r\npermanent crops--land cultivated for crops that are not replanted after each\r\nharvest (citrus, coffee, rubber);  meadows and pastures--land permanently used\r\nfor herbaceous forage crops; forest and woodland--under dense or open stands of\r\ntrees; and other--any land type not specifically mentioned above (urban areas,\r\nroads, desert).\r\n\r\nLeaders: The chief of state is the titular leader of the country who represents\r\nthe state at official and ceremonial functions but is not involved with the day-\r\nto-day activities of the government. The head of government is the\r\nadministrative leader who manages the day-to-day activities of the government.\r\nIn the UK, the monarch is the chief of state, and the Prime Minister is the head\r\nof government. In the US, the President is both the chief of state and the head\r\nof government.\r\n\r\nLife expectancy at birth: The average number of years to be lived by a group of\r\npeople all born in the same year, if mortality at each age remains constant in\r\nthe future.\r\n\r\nLiteracy: There are no universal definitions and standards of literacy. Unless\r\notherwise noted, all rates are based on the most common definition--the ability\r\nto read and write at a specified age. Detailing the standards that individual\r\ncountries use to assess the ability to read and write is beyond the scope of\r\nthis publication.\r\n\r\nMaritime claims: The proximity of neighboring states may prevent some national\r\nclaims from being extended the full distance.\r\n\r\nMerchant marine: All ships engaged in the carriage of goods. All commercial\r\nvessels (as opposed to all nonmilitary ships), which excludes tugs, fishing\r\nvessels, offshore oil rigs, etc.; also, a grouping of merchant ships by\r\nnationality or register.\r\n\r\nCaptive register--A register of ships maintained by a territory, possession, or\r\ncolony primarily or exclusively for the use of ships owned in the parent\r\ncountry; also referred to as an offshore register, the offshore equivalent of an\r\ninternal register. Ships on a captive register will fly the same flag as the\r\nparent country, or a local variant of it, but will be subject to the maritime\r\nlaws and taxation rules of the offshore territory. Although the nature of a\r\ncaptive register makes it especially desirable for ships owned in the parent\r\ncountry, just as in the internal register, the ships may also be owned abroad.\r\nThe captive register then acts as a flag of convenience register, except that it\r\nis not the register of an independent state.\r\n\r\nFlag of convenience register--A national register offering registration to a\r\nmerchant ship not owned in the flag state. The major flags of convenience (FOC)\r\nattract ships to their register by virtue of low fees, low or nonexistent\r\ntaxation of profits, and liberal manning requirements. True FOC registers are\r\ncharacterized by having relatively few of the ships registered actually owned in\r\nthe flag state. Thus, while virtually any flag can be used for ships under a\r\ngiven set of circumstances, an FOC register is one where the majority of the\r\nmerchant fleet is owned abroad. It is also referred to as an open register.\r\n\r\nFlag state--The nation in which a ship is registered and which holds legal\r\njurisdiction over operation of the ship, whether at home or abroad. Differences\r\nin flag state maritime legislation determine how a ship is manned and taxed and\r\nwhether a foreign-owned ship may be placed on the register.\r\n\r\nInternal register--A register of ships maintained as a subset of a national\r\nregister. Ships on the internal register fly the national flag and have that\r\nnationality but are subject to a separate set of maritime rules from those on\r\nthe main national register. These differences usually include lower taxation of\r\nprofits, manning by foreign nationals, and, usually, ownership outside the flag\r\nstate (when it functions as an FOC register). The Norwegian International Ship\r\nRegister and Danish International Ship Register are the most notable examples of\r\nan internal register. Both have been instrumental in stemming flight from the\r\nnational flag to flags of convenience and in attracting foreign owned ships to\r\nthe Norwegian and Danish flags.\r\n\r\nMerchant ship--A vessel that carries goods against payment of freight; commonly\r\nused to denote any nonmilitary ship but accurately restricted to commercial\r\nvessels only.\r\n\r\nRegister--The record of a ship's ownership and nationality as listed with the\r\nmaritime authorities of a country; also, the compendium of such individual\r\nships' registrations. Registration of a ship provides it with a nationality and\r\nmakes it subject to the laws of the country in which registered (the flag state)\r\nregardless of the nationality of the ship's ultimate owner.\r\n\r\nMoney figures: All money figures are expressed in contemporaneous US dollars\r\nunless otherwise indicated.\r\n\r\nNational product: The total output of goods and services in a country in a given\r\nyear. See Gross domestic product (GDP), Gross national product (GNP), and\r\nGNP/GDP methodology.\r\n\r\nNet migration rate: The balance between the number of persons entering and\r\nleaving a country during the year per 1,000 persons (based on midyear\r\npopulation). An excess of persons entering the country is referred to as net\r\nimmigration (3.56 migrants/1,000 population); an excess of persons leaving the\r\ncountry as net emigration (-9.26 migrants/1,000 population).\r\n\r\nPopulation: Figures are estimates from the Bureau of the Census based on\r\nstatistics from population censuses, vital statistics registration systems, or\r\nsample surveys pertaining to the recent past, and on assumptions about future\r\ntrends. Starting with the 1993 Factbook demographic estimates for some countries\r\n(mostly African) have taken into account the effects of the growing incidence of\r\nAIDS infections; in 1993 these countries were Burkina, Burundi, Central African\r\nRepublic, Congo, Cote d'Ivoire, Haiti, Kenya, Malawi, Rwanda, Tanzania, Uganda,\r\nZaire, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Thailand, and Brazil.\r\n\r\nTotal fertility rate: The average number of children that would be born per\r\nwoman if all women lived to the end of their childbearing years and bore\r\nchildren according to a given fertility rate at each age.\r\n\r\nYears: All year references are for the calendar year (CY) unless indicated as\r\nfiscal year (FY).\r\n\r\nNote: Information for the US and US dependencies was compiled from material in\r\nthe public domain and does not represent Intelligence Community estimates.

About 1.4 million Afghan refugees remain in\r\n  Pakistan and about 2 million in Iran. Another 1 million probably moved\r\n  into and around urban areas within Afghanistan.

The economy\r\n  rebounded in 1993 after a severe depression accompanying the collapse\r\n  of the previous centrally planned system in 1990 and 1991.\r\n  Stabilization policies, including public sector layoffs and reduced\r\n  social services, have improved the government's fiscal situation and\r\n  reduced inflation. The recovery was spurred by the remittances of some\r\n  5% of the population which works abroad, mostly in Greece and Italy.\r\n  Foreign assistance and humanitarian aid also supported the recovery.\r\n  Most agricultural land was privatized in 1992, substantially improving\r\n  peasant incomes. Albania's limited industrial sector, now less than\r\n  one-sixth of GDP, continued to decline in 1993. A sharp fall in\r\n  chromium prices reduced hard currency receipts from the mining sector.\r\n  Large segments of the population, especially those living in urban\r\n  areas, continue to depend on humanitarian aid to meet basic food\r\n  requirements. Unemployment remains a severe problem accounting for\r\n  approximately one-fifth of the work force. Growth is expected to\r\n  continue in 1994, but could falter if Albania becomes involved in the\r\n  conflict in the former Yugoslavia, workers' remittances from Greece\r\n  are reduced, or foreign assistance declines.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $3.3 billion (1993 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  11% (1993)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $1,100 (1993 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  31% (1993 est.)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  18% (1993 est.)\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues:\r\n  $1.1 billion\r\nexpenditures:\r\n  $1.4 billion, including capital expenditures of $70 million (1991\r\n  est.)\r\nExports:\r\n  $70 million (f.o.b., 1992)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  asphalt, metals and metallic ores, electricity, crude oil, vegetables,\r\n  fruits, tobacco\r\npartners:\r\n  Italy, The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Germany, Greece,\r\n  Czechoslovakia, Poland, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary\r\nImports:\r\n  $524 million (f.o.b., 1992)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  machinery, consumer goods, grains\r\npartners:\r\n  Italy, The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Germany,\r\n  Czechoslovakia, Romania, Poland, Hungary, Bulgaria, Greece\r\nExternal debt:\r\n  $724 million (1993 est.)\r\nIndustrial production:\r\n  growth rate -10% (1993 est.);

Algiers' efforts to reform one of\r\n  the most centrally planned economies in the Arab world began after the\r\n  1986 collapse of world oil prices plunged the country into a severe\r\n  recession. In 1989, the government launched a comprehensive,\r\n  IMF-supported program to achieve macroeconomic stabilization and to\r\n  introduce market mechanisms into the economy. Despite substantial\r\n  progress toward macroeconomic adjustment, in 1992 the reform drive\r\n  stalled as Algiers became embroiled in political turmoil. In September\r\n  1993, a new government was formed, one of whose priorities was the\r\n  resumption and acceleration of the structural adjustment process.\r\n  Buffeted by the slump in world oil prices and burdened with a heavy\r\n  foreign debt, Algiers in 1993 resumed negotiations with the IMF and is\r\n  on track to conclude a standby arrangement with the Fund in 1994.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $89 billion (1993 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  1% (1993 est.)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $3,300 (1992 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  22% (1993 est.)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  22% (1993 est.)\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues:\r\n  $14.4 billion\r\nexpenditures:\r\n  $14.6 billion, including capital expenditures of $3.5 billion (1992\r\n  est.)\r\nExports:\r\n  $11.4 billion (f.o.b., 1993 est.)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  petroleum and natural gas 97%\r\npartners:\r\n  Italy 21%, France 16%, US 14%, Germany 13%, Spain 9%\r\nImports:\r\n  $9 billion (f.o.b., 1993 est.)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  capital goods 39.7%, food and beverages 21.7%, consumer goods 11.8%\r\n  (1990)\r\npartners:\r\n  France 29%, Italy 14%, Spain 9%, US 9%, Germany 7%\r\nExternal debt:\r\n  $26 billion (1994)\r\nIndustrial production:\r\n  growth rate NA%\r\nElectricity:\r\ncapacity:\r\n  6,380,000 kW\r\nproduction:\r\n  16.384 billion kWh\r\nconsumption per capita:\r\n  630 kWh (1992)\r\nIndustries:\r\n  petroleum, light industries, natural gas, mining, electrical,\r\n  petrochemical, food processing\r\nAgriculture:\r\n  accounts for 12.8% of GDP (1993 est.) and employs 22% of labor force;\r\n  products- wheat, barley, oats, grapes, olives, citrus, fruits, sheep,\r\n  cattle;

An estimated 13 million tourists visit annually, attracted by\r\n  Andorra's duty-free status and by its summer and winter resorts. The\r\n  banking sector, with its \"tax haven\" status, also contributes\r\n  substantially to the economy. Agricultural production is limited by a\r\n  scarcity of arable land, and most food has to be imported. The\r\n  principal livestock activity is sheep raising. Manufacturing consists\r\n  mainly of cigarettes, cigars, and furniture. Andorra is a member of\r\n  the EU Customs Union; it is unclear what effect the European Single\r\n  Market will have on the advantages Andorra obtains from its duty-free\r\n  status.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $760 million (1992 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  NA%\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $14,000 (1992 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  NA%\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  0%\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues:\r\n  $138 million\r\nexpenditures:\r\n  $177 million, Including capital expenditures of $NA (1993)\r\nExports:\r\n  $30 million (f.o.b., 1993 est.)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  electricity, tobacco products, furniture\r\npartners:\r\n  France, Spain\r\nImports:\r\n  $NA\r\ncommodities:\r\n  consumer goods, food\r\npartners:\r\n  France, Spain\r\nExternal debt:\r\n  $NA\r\nIndustrial production:\r\n  growth rate NA%\r\nElectricity:\r\ncapacity:\r\n  35,000 kW\r\nproduction:\r\n  140 million kWh\r\nconsumption per capita:\r\n  2,570 kWh (1992)\r\nIndustries:\r\n  tourism (particularly skiing), sheep, timber, tobacco, banking\r\nAgriculture:\r\n  sheep raising;

Oil production is\r\n  vital to the economy, contributing about 60% to GDP. Bitter internal\r\n  fighting continues to severely affect the economy, and food must be\r\n  imported. In 1993, production fell by an estimated 22.6%, mainly\r\n  because of the capture by insurgents of the oil town of Soyo and\r\n  diamond-producing areas in northeastern Angola. Angola has rich\r\n  natural resources - notably gold, diamonds, and arable land, in\r\n  addition to large oil depoaits - but will need to end the war and\r\n  reform government policies if it is to achieve its potential.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $5.7 billion (1993 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  -22.6% (1993 est.)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $600 (1993 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  1,840% (1993 est.)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  15% with considerable underemployment (1993 est.)\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues:\r\n  $928 million\r\nexpenditures:\r\n  $2.5 billion, including capital expenditures of $963 million (1992\r\n  est.)\r\nExports:\r\n  $3 billion (f.o.b., 1993 est.)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  oil, diamonds, refined petroleum products, gas, coffee, sisal, fish\r\n  and fish products, timber, cotton\r\npartners:\r\n  US, France, Germany, Netherlands, Brazil\r\nImports:\r\n  $1.6 billion (f.o.b., 1992 est.)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  capital equipment (machinery and electrical equipment), food, vehicles\r\n  and spare parts, textiles and clothing, medicines;

Administration is carried out through consultative member\r\n  meetings - the 18th Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting was in Japan\r\n  in April 1993. Currently, there are 42 treaty member nations: 26\r\n  consultative and 16 acceding. Consultative (voting) members include\r\n  the seven nations that claim portions of Antarctica as national\r\n  territory (some claims overlap) and 19 nonclaimant nations. The US and\r\n  some other nations that have made no claims have reserved the right to\r\n  do so. The US does not recognize the claims of others.

Nevertheless, following decades of mismanagement and\r\n  statist policies, the economy in the late 1980s was plagued with huge\r\n  external debts and recurring bouts of hyperinflation. Elected in 1989,\r\n  in the depths of recession, President MENEM has implemented a\r\n  comprehensive economic restructuring program that shows signs of\r\n  putting Argentina on a path of stable, sustainable growth. Argentina's\r\n  currency has traded at par with the US dollar since April 1991, and\r\n  inflation has fallen to its lowest level in 20 years. Argentines have\r\n  responded to the relative price stability by repatriating flight\r\n  capital and investing in domestic industry. Growth slowed somewhat in\r\n  1993 but Argentina still registered an impressive 6% advance, fueled\r\n  largely by inflows of foreign capital and strong domestic consumption\r\n  spending. The government's major short term objective is encouraging\r\n  exports, e.g., by reducing domestic costs of production. Much remains\r\n  to be done in the 1990s in dismantling the old statist barriers to\r\n  growth and in solidifying the recent economic gains.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $185 billion (1993 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  6% (1993 est.)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $5,500 (1993 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  7.4% (1993 est.)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  10% (1993)\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues:\r\n  $33.1 billion\r\nexpenditures:\r\n  $35.8 billion, including capital expenditures of $3.5 billion (1992)\r\nExports:\r\n  $12.7 billion (f.o.b., 1993 est.)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  meat, wheat, corn, oilseed, hides, wool\r\npartners:\r\n  US 12%, Brazil, Italy, Japan, Netherlands\r\nImports:\r\n  $16 billion (c.i.f., 1993 est.)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  machinery and equipment, chemicals, metals, fuels and lubricants,\r\n  agricultural products\r\npartners:\r\n  US 22%, Brazil, Germany, Bolivia, Japan, Italy, Netherlands\r\nExternal debt:\r\n  $73 billion (April 1994)\r\nIndustrial production:\r\n  growth rate 10% (1992 est.);

Armenia is a large food\r\n  importer and its mineral deposits (gold, bauxite) are small. The\r\n  economic decline in the past three years (1991-93) has been\r\n  particularly severe due to the ongoing conflict over the Armenian\r\n  enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh in Azerbaijan. Azerbaijan and Turkey have\r\n  blockaded pipeline and railroad traffic to Armenia for its support of\r\n  the Karabakh Armenians. This has left Armenia with only sporadic\r\n  deliveries of natural gas through unstable Georgia, while other fuel\r\n  and raw materials are in critical short supply. Inflation, roughly 14%\r\n  per month in the first nine months of 1993, surged even higher in the\r\n  fourth quarter. In late 1993, most industrial enterprises were either\r\n  shut down or operating at drastically reduced levels. Only small\r\n  quantities of food were available (mostly humanitarian aid), heat was\r\n  nonexistent, and electricity strictly rationed. An economic recovery\r\n  cannot be expected until the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict is settled and\r\n  until transportation through Georgia improves.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $7.1 billion (1993 estimate from\r\n  the UN International Comparison Program, as extended to 1991 and\r\n  published in the World Bank's World Development Report 1993;

Rich in natural resources, Australia is a major exporter of\r\n  agricultural products, minerals, metals, and fossil fuels. Primary\r\n  products account for more than 60% of the value of total exports, so\r\n  that, as in 1983-84, a downturn in world commodity prices can have a\r\n  big impact on the economy. The government is pushing for increased\r\n  exports of manufactured goods, but competition in international\r\n  markets continues to be severe. Australia has suffered from the low\r\n  growth and high unemployment characterizing the OECD countries in the\r\n  early 1990s. In 1992-93 the economy recovered slowly from the\r\n  prolonged recession of 1990-91, a major restraining factor being weak\r\n  world demand for Australia's exports. Unemployment has hovered around\r\n  10% and probably will remain at that level in 1994 as productivity\r\n  gains rather than more jobs account for growth.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $339.7 billion (1993)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  4% (1993)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $19,100 (1993)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  1.1% (1993)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  10% (December 1993)\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues:\r\n  $71.9 billion\r\nexpenditures:\r\n  $83.1 billion, including capital expenditures of $NA (FY93)\r\nExports:\r\n  $44.1 billion (1992)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  coal, gold, meat, wool, alumina, wheat, machinery and transport\r\n  equipment\r\npartners:\r\n  Japan 25%, US 11%, South Korea 6%, NZ 5.7%, UK, Taiwan, Singapore,\r\n  Hong Kong (1992)\r\nImports:\r\n  $43.6 billion (1992)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  machinery and transport equipment, computers and office machines,\r\n  crude oil and petroleum products\r\npartners:\r\n  US 23%, Japan 18%, UK 6%, Germany 5.7%, NZ 4% (1992)\r\nExternal debt:\r\n  $141.1 billion (1993)\r\nIndustrial production:\r\n  growth rate 1.9% (FY93);

Thanks to its raw material endowment, a technically\r\n  skilled labor force, and strong links to German industrial firms,\r\n  Austria occupies specialized niches in European industry and services\r\n  (tourism, banking) and produces almost enough food to feed itself with\r\n  only 8% of the labor force in agriculture. Increased export sales\r\n  resulting from German unification, boosted Austria's economy through\r\n  1991, but Austria's GDP growth slowed to 2% in 1992 and -0.5% in 1993\r\n  due to the weak international economy, particularly in Germany - its\r\n  largest trading partner. GDP growth will resume slowly in 1994, with\r\n  estimates ranging from a 0.5% to a 1% increase. Unemployment has risen\r\n  to 7% as a result of the slowdown and will continue to rise in 1994.\r\n  Problems for the l990s include an aging population, the high level of\r\n  subsidies, and the struggle to keep welfare benefits within budgetary\r\n  capabilities. Austria's government has taken measures to make the\r\n  economy more liberal and open by introducing a major tax reform,\r\n  privatizing state-owned firms, and liberalizing cross-border capital\r\n  movements. Although it will face increased competition, Austria should\r\n  benefit from the continued opening of eastern European markets, as\r\n  well as the 1 January 1994 start of the European Economic Area which\r\n  extends the European Union rules on the free movement of people,\r\n  capital, and goods and services to four members (including Austria) of\r\n  the European Free Trade Association (EFTA). Austria has concluded\r\n  membership negotiations with the European Union and is expected to\r\n  join in early 1995, thus broadening European economic unity. The\r\n  government, however, plans to hold a national referendum on the matter\r\n  on 12 June 1994; support for and opposition to membership appears\r\n  about equal.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $134.4 billion (1993)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  -0.5% (1993)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $17,000 (1993)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  3.7% (1993 est.)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  7% (1993 est.)\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues:\r\n  $52.2 billion\r\nexpenditures:\r\n  $60.3 billion, including capital expenditures of $NA (1993 est.)\r\nExports:\r\n  $39.9 billion (f.o.b., 1993)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  machinery and equipment, iron and steel, lumber, textiles, paper\r\n  products, chemicals\r\npartners:\r\n  EC 63.5% (Germany 38.9%), EFTA 9.0%, Eastern Europe/FSU 12.3%, Japan\r\n  1.5%, US 3.35% (1993)\r\nImports:\r\n  $48.5 billion (f.o.b., 1993)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  petroleum, foodstuffs, machinery and equipment, vehicles, chemicals,\r\n  textiles and clothing, pharmaceuticals\r\npartners:\r\n  EC 66.8% (Germany 41.3%), EFTA 6.7%, Eastern Europe/FSU 7.5%, Japan\r\n  4.4%, US 4.4% (1993)\r\nExternal debt:\r\n  $16.2 billion (1993 est.)\r\nIndustrial production:\r\n  growth rate -4.5% (1993 est.)\r\nElectricity:\r\ncapacity:\r\n  17,600,000 kW\r\nproduction:\r\n  49.5 billion kWh\r\nconsumption per capita:\r\n  6,300 kWh (1992)\r\nIndustries:\r\n  foods, iron and steel, machines, textiles, chemicals, electrical,\r\n  paper and pulp, tourism, mining, motor vehicles\r\nAgriculture:\r\n  accounts for 3.2% of GDP (including forestry);

It resembles the Central\r\n  Asian states in its majority Muslim population, high structural\r\n  unemployment, and low standard of living. The economy's most prominent\r\n  products are oil, cotton, and gas. Production from the Caspian oil and\r\n  gas field has been in decline for several years. With foreign\r\n  assistance, the oil industry might generate the funds needed to spur\r\n  industrial development. However, civil unrest, marked by armed\r\n  conflict in the Nagorno-Karabakh region between Muslim Azeris and\r\n  Christian Armenians, makes foreign investors wary. Azerbaijan\r\n  accounted for 1.5% to 2% of the capital stock and output of the former\r\n  Soviet Union. Azerbaijan shares all the formidable problems of the\r\n  ex-Soviet republics in making the transition from a command to a\r\n  market economy, but its considerable energy resources brighten its\r\n  prospects somewhat. Old economic ties and structures have yet to be\r\n  replaced. A particularly galling constraint on economic revival is the\r\n  Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, said to consume 25% of Azerbaijan's\r\n  economic resources.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $15.5 billion (1993 estimate from\r\n  the UN International Comparison Program, as extended to 1991 and\r\n  published in the World Bank's World Development Report 1993;

Its economy is overwhelmingly agricultural,\r\n  with the cultivation of rice the single most important activity in the\r\n  economy. Major impediments to growth include frequent cyclones and\r\n  floods, government interference with the economy, a rapidly growing\r\n  labor force that cannot be absorbed by agriculture, a low level of\r\n  industrialization, failure to fully exploit energy resources (natural\r\n  gas), and inefficient and inadequate power supplies. Excellent rice\r\n  crops and expansion of the export garment industry helped growth in\r\n  FY92 and FY93. Policy reforms intended to reduce government regulation\r\n  of private industry and promote public-sector efficiency have been\r\n  announced but are being implemented only slowly.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $122 billion (1993 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  4.3% (FY93)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $1,000 (1993 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  1.4% (FY93)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  NA%\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues:\r\n  $2.5 billion\r\nexpenditures:\r\n  $3.7 billion, including capital expenditures of $NA (FY92)\r\nExports:\r\n  $2.1 billion (FY93)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  garments, jute and jute goods, leather, shrimp\r\npartners:\r\n  US 33%, Western Europe 39% (Germany 8.4%, Italy 6%) (FY92 est.)\r\nImports:\r\n  $3.5 billion (FY93)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  capital goods, petroleum, food, textiles\r\npartners:\r\n  Hong Kong 7.5%, Singapore 7.4%, China 7.4%, Japan 7.1% (FY92 est.)\r\nExternal debt:\r\n  $13.5 billion (June 1993)\r\nIndustrial production:\r\n  growth rate 6.9% (FY93 est.);

The tourist\r\n  industry is now a major employer of the labor force and a primary\r\n  source of foreign exchange.

It also serves as a\r\n  transport link for Russian oil exports to the Baltic states and\r\n  Eastern and Western Europe. The breakup of the Soviet Union and its\r\n  command economy has resulted in a sharp economic contraction as\r\n  traditional trade ties have collapsed. At the same time, the\r\n  Belarusian Government has lagged behind most other former Soviet\r\n  states in economic reform; privatization has barely begun; the\r\n  agriculture sector remains highly subsidized; the state retains\r\n  control over many prices; and the system of state orders and\r\n  distribution persists. Meanwhile, the national bank continues to pour\r\n  credits into inefficient enterprises, fueling inflation and weakening\r\n  incentives to improve performance. The government is pinning its hopes\r\n  on reintegration with the Russian economy, but such a path would only\r\n  partially restore traditional trade ties. Until economic reform is\r\n  embraced, Belarus will continue in its economic morass.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $61 billion (1993 estimate from\r\n  the UN International Comparison Program, as extended to 1991 and\r\n  published in the World Bank's World Development Report 1993;

With few natural resources Belgium must import substantial\r\n  quantities of raw materials and export a large volume of manufactures,\r\n  making its economy unusually dependent on the state of world markets.\r\n  Three fourths of its trade is with other EC countries.

Low prices in recent years have kept down hard\r\n  currency earnings from Benin's major exports of agricultural products,\r\n  primarily cotton. A World Bank supported structural adjustment program\r\n  begun in 1989 has helped strengthen the economy through such measures\r\n  as trimming the government payroll, reforming the tax system, and\r\n  encouraging private investment, both domestic and foreign.

Rugged mountains\r\n  dominate the terrain and make the building of roads and other\r\n  infrastructure difficult and expensive. The economy is closely aligned\r\n  with that of India through strong trade and monetary links. The\r\n  industrial sector is small and technologically backward, with most\r\n  production of the cottage industry type. Most development projects,\r\n  such as road construction, rely on Indian migrant labor. Bhutan's\r\n  hydropower potential and its attraction for tourists are its most\r\n  important natural resources; however, the government limits the number\r\n  of tourists to 4,000 per year to minimize foreign influence. Much of\r\n  the impetus for growth has come from large public-sector companies.\r\n  Nevertheless, in recent years, Bhutan has shifted toward decentralized\r\n  development planning and greater private initiative. The government\r\n  privatized several large public-sector firms, is revamping its trade\r\n  regime and liberalizing administerial procedures over industrial\r\n  licensing.

However, Bolivia has experienced generally\r\n  improving economic conditions since the PAZ Estenssoro administration\r\n  (1985-89) introduced market-oriented policies which reduced inflation\r\n  from 11,700% in 1985 to about 20% in 1988. PAZ Estenssoro was followed\r\n  as President by Jaime PAZ Zamora (1989-93) who continued the\r\n  free-market policies of his predecessor, despite opposition from his\r\n  own party and from Bolivia's once powerful labor movement. By\r\n  maintaining fiscal discipline, PAZ Zamora helped reduce inflation to\r\n  9.3% in 1993, while GDP grew by an annual average of 3.25% during his\r\n  tenure. Inaugurated in August 1993, President SANCHEZ DE LOZADA has\r\n  vowed to advance government market-oriented economic reforms he helped\r\n  launch as PAZ Estenssoro's Planning Minister.

Bosnia's Serbs -\r\n  supported by neighboring Serbia - responded with armed resistance\r\n  aimed at partitioning the republic along ethnic lines and joining\r\n  Serb-held areas to a \"greater Serbia.\" Since the onset of the\r\n  conflict, which has driven approximately half of the pre-war\r\n  population of 4.4 million from their homes, both the Bosnian Serbs and\r\n  the Bosnian Croats have asserted control of more than three-quarters\r\n  of the territory formerly under the control of the Government of\r\n  Bosnia and Herzegovina. The UN and the EU are continuing to try to\r\n  mediate a plan for peace. In March 1994 Bosnian Muslims and Bosnian\r\n  Croats signed an agreement in Washington, DC, creating a Federation of\r\n  Bosnia and Herzegovina, which is to include territories in which\r\n  Muslims or Croats predominated, according to the 1991 census.

Tito had pushed the development of military industries in\r\n  the republic with the result that Bosnia hosted a large share of\r\n  Yugoslavia's defense plants. As of April 1994, Bosnia and Herzegovina\r\n  was being torn apart by the continued bitter interethnic warfare that\r\n  has caused production to plummet, unemployment and inflation to soar,\r\n  and human misery to multiply. No reliable economic statistics for\r\n  1992-93 are available, although output clearly has fallen\r\n  substantially below the levels of earlier years.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $NA\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  NA%\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $NA\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  NA%\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  NA%\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues:\r\n  $NA\r\nexpenditures:\r\n  $NA, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\nExports:\r\n  $NA\r\ncommodities:\r\n  NA\r\npartners:\r\n  NA\r\nImports:\r\n  $NA\r\ncommodities:\r\n  NA\r\npartners:\r\n  NA\r\nExternal debt:\r\n  $NA\r\nIndustrial production:\r\n  growth rate NA%;

The driving\r\n  force behind the rapid economic growth of the 1970s and 1980s has been\r\n  the mining industry. This sector, mostly on the strength of diamonds,\r\n  has gone from generating 25% of GDP in 1980 to 50% in 1991. No other\r\n  sector has experienced such growth, especially not agriculture, which\r\n  is plagued by erratic rainfall and poor soils. The unemployment rate\r\n  remains a problem at 25%. Although diamond production was down\r\n  slightly in 1992, substantial gains in coal output and manufacturing\r\n  helped boost the economy. Recovery in sluggish diamond markets in\r\n  second half 1993 helped Botswana achieve moderate growth of 3% for the\r\n  year.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $6 billion (1993 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  3% (1993 est.)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $4,500 (1993 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  14% (1993 est.)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  25% (1993 est.)\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues:\r\n  $1.7 billion\r\nexpenditures:\r\n  $1.99 billion, including capital expenditures of $652 million (FY94)\r\nExports:\r\n  $1.7 billion (f.o.b. 1992)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  diamonds 78%, copper and nickel 6%, meat 5%\r\npartners:\r\n  Switzerland, UK, SACU (Southern African Customs Union)\r\nImports:\r\n  $1.8 billion (c.i.f., 1992)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  foodstuffs, vehicles and transport equipment, textiles, petroleum\r\n  products\r\npartners:\r\n  Switzerland, SACU (Southern African Customs Union), UK, US\r\nExternal debt:\r\n  $344 million (December 1991)\r\nIndustrial production:\r\n  growth rate 6.8% (FY91);

the globe has a white equatorial band with the motto ORDEM E\r\n  PROGRESSO (Order and Progress)\r\n\r\n@Brazil, Economy\r\n\r\nOverview:\r\n  The economy, with large agrarian, mining, and manufacturing sectors,\r\n  entered the 1990s with declining real growth, runaway inflation, an\r\n  unserviceable foreign debt of $122 billion, and a lack of policy\r\n  direction. In addition, the economy remained highly regulated,\r\n  inward-looking, and protected by substantial trade and investment\r\n  barriers. Ownership of major industrial and mining facilities is\r\n  divided among private interests - including several multinationals -\r\n  and the government. Most large agricultural holdings are private, with\r\n  the government channeling financing to this sector. Conflicts between\r\n  large landholders and landless peasants have produced intermittent\r\n  violence. The COLLOR government, which assumed office in March 1990,\r\n  launched an ambitious reform program that sought to modernize and\r\n  reinvigorate the economy by stabilizing prices, deregulating the\r\n  economy, and opening it to increased foreign competition. The\r\n  government also obtained an IMF standby loan in January 1992 and\r\n  reached agreements with commercial bankers on the repayment of\r\n  interest arrears and on the reduction of debt and debt service\r\n  payments. Galloping inflation (the rate doubled in 1992 and by March\r\n  1994 had risen to 42% per month) continues to undermine economic\r\n  stability. Itamar FRANCO, who assumed the presidency following\r\n  President COLLOR'S resignation in December 1992, was out of step with\r\n  COLLOR'S reform agenda; initiatives to redress fiscal problems,\r\n  privatize state enterprises, and liberalize trade and investment\r\n  policies have lost momentum.

Many aspects of a market economy have been put in\r\n  place and have begun to function, but much of the economy, especially\r\n  the industrial sector, has yet to re-establish market links lost with\r\n  the collapse of other centrally planned Eastern European economies.\r\n  The prices of many imported industrial inputs, especially energy\r\n  products, have risen markedly, and falling real wages have not\r\n  sufficed to restore competitiveness. The trade deficit, exacerbated by\r\n  UN trade sanctions against neighboring Serbia, grew in late 1993,\r\n  accelerating the depreciation of the lev. These difficulties in\r\n  adjusting to the challenges of a more open system, together with a\r\n  severe drought, caused nonagricultural output to fall by perhaps 8% in\r\n  1993. The government plans more extensive privatization in 1994 to\r\n  improve the management of state enterprises and to encourage foreign\r\n  investment in ailing state firms. Bulgaria resumed payments on its $10\r\n  billion in commercial debt in 1993 following the negotiation of a 50%\r\n  write-off. An IMF program and second agreement with official creditors\r\n  on Bulgaria's smaller amount of official debt are required to close\r\n  the debt deal.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $33.9 billion (1993 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  -4% (1993 est.)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $3,800 (1993 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  64% (1993)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  16% (1993)\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues:\r\n  $14 billion\r\nexpenditures:\r\n  $17.4 billion, including capital expenditures of $610 million (1993\r\n  est.)\r\nExports:\r\n  $3.5 billion (f.o.b., 1991)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  machinery and equipment 30.6%;

Government policy in the last five years, 1989-93, has\r\n  aimed at revitalizing the economy after four decades of tight central\r\n  planning. Thus, private activity has markedly increased; foreign\r\n  investment has been encouraged, so far with moderate success; and\r\n  efforts continue to increase the efficiency of state enterprises.\r\n  Published estimates of Burma's foreign trade are greatly understated\r\n  because of the volume of black market trade. A major ongoing problem\r\n  is the failure to achieve monetary and fiscal stability. Inflation has\r\n  been running at 25% to 30% annually. Good weather helped boost GDP by\r\n  perhaps 5% in 1993.

Its economic health depends on the coffee crop,\r\n  which accounts for 80% of foreign exchange earnings. The ability to\r\n  pay for imports therefore continues to rest largely on the vagaries of\r\n  the climate and the international coffee market. As part of its\r\n  economic reform agenda, launched in February 1991 with IMF and World\r\n  Bank support, Burundi is trying to diversify its agricultural exports\r\n  and attract foreign investment in industry. Several state-owned coffee\r\n  companies were privatized via public auction in September 1991.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $4.4 billion (1993 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  -3.8% (1991)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $700 (1993 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  4.7% (1992 est.)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  NA%\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues:\r\n  $318 million\r\nexpenditures:\r\n  $326 million, including capital expenditures of $150 million (1991\r\n  est.)\r\nExports:\r\n  $40.8 million (f.o.b., 1992 est.)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  coffee 81%, tea, cotton, hides, and skins\r\npartners:\r\n  EC 57%, US 19%, Asia 1%\r\nImports:\r\n  $188 million (c.i.f., 1992 est.)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  capital goods 31%, petroleum products 15%, foodstuffs, consumer goods\r\npartners:\r\n  EC 45%, Asia 29%, US 2%\r\nExternal debt:\r\n  $970 million (1991)\r\nIndustrial production:\r\n  growth rate 11% (1991 est.);

Government leaders are moving toward restoring\r\n  fiscal and monetary discipline and have established good working\r\n  relations with international financial institutions. Despite such\r\n  positive developments, the reconstruction effort faces many tough\r\n  challenges. Rural Cambodia, where 90% of almost ten million Khmer\r\n  live, remains mired in poverty. The almost total lack of basic\r\n  infrastructure in the countryside will hinder development and will\r\n  contribute to a growing imbalance in growth between urban and rural\r\n  areas over the near term.

Still, it faces\r\n  many of the serious problems facing other underdeveloped countries,\r\n  such as political instability, a top-heavy civil service, and a\r\n  generally unfavorable climate for business enterprise. The development\r\n  of the oil sector led rapid economic growth between 1970 and 1985.\r\n  Growth came to an abrupt halt in 1986, precipitated by steep declines\r\n  in the prices of major exports: coffee, cocoa, and petroleum. Export\r\n  earnings were cut by almost one-third, and inefficiencies in fiscal\r\n  management were exposed. In 1990-93, with support from the IMF and\r\n  World Bank, the government began to introduce reforms designed to spur\r\n  business investment, increase efficiency in agriculture, and\r\n  recapitalize the nation's banks. Political instability following\r\n  suspect elections in 1992 brought IMF/WB structural adjustment to a\r\n  halt. Although the 50% devaluation of the currency in January 1994\r\n  improves the potential for export growth, mismanagement remains and is\r\n  the main barrier to economic improvement.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $19.1 billion (1993 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  NA\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $1,500 (1993 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  3% (1990 est.)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  25% (1990 est.)\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues:\r\n  $1.7 billion\r\nexpenditures:\r\n  $2.4 billion, including capital expenditures of $422 million (FY90\r\n  est.)\r\nExports:\r\n  $1.8 billion (f.o.b., 1991)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  petroleum products 51%, coffee, beans, cocoa, aluminum products,\r\n  timber\r\npartners:\r\n  EC (particularly France) about 50%, US, African countries\r\nImports:\r\n  $1.2 billion (c.i.f., 1991)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  machines and electrical equipment, food, consumer goods, transport\r\n  equipment\r\npartners:\r\n  EC about 60% (France 41%, Germany 9%), African countries, Japan, US 4%\r\nExternal debt:\r\n  $6 billion (1991)\r\nIndustrial production:\r\n  growth rate 6.4% (FY87);

Since World War II the impressive\r\n  growth of the manufacturing, mining, and service sectors has\r\n  transformed the nation from a largely rural economy into one primarily\r\n  industrial and urban. In the 1980s, Canada registered one of the\r\n  highest rates of real growth among the OECD nations, averaging about\r\n  3.2%. With its great natural resources, skilled labor force, and\r\n  modern capital plant, Canada has excellent economic prospects,\r\n  although the country still faces high unemployment and a growing debt.\r\n  Moreover, the continuing constitutional impasse between English- and\r\n  French-speaking areas has observers discussing a possible split in the\r\n  confederation; foreign investors have become edgy.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $617.7 billion (1993)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  2.4% (1993)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $22,200 (1993)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  1.9% (1993)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  11% (December 1993)\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues:\r\n  $92.34 billion (Federal)\r\nexpenditures:\r\n  $123.04 billion, including capital expenditures of $NA (FY93 est.)\r\nExports:\r\n  $133.9 billion (f.o.b., 1993)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  newsprint, wood pulp, timber, crude petroleum, machinery, natural gas,\r\n  aluminum, motor vehicles and parts;

The economy is\r\n  service oriented, with commerce, transport, and public services\r\n  accounting for 60% of GDP. Although nearly 70% of the population lives\r\n  in rural areas, agriculture's share of GDP is only 20%; the fishing\r\n  sector accounts for 4%. About 90% of food must be imported. The\r\n  fishing potential, mostly lobster and tuna, is not fully exploited. In\r\n  1988 fishing represented only 3.5% of GDP. Cape Verde annually runs a\r\n  high trade deficit, financed by remittances from emigrants and foreign\r\n  aid. Economic reforms launched by the new democratic government in\r\n  February 1991 are aimed at developing the private sector and\r\n  attracting foreign investment to diversify the economy.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - exchange rate conversion - $415 million (1991 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  3.3% (1991 est.)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $1,070 (1991)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  8.7% (1991 est.)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  25% (1988)\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues:\r\n  $104 million\r\nexpenditures:\r\n  $133 million, including capital expenditures of $72 million (1991\r\n  est.)\r\nExports:\r\n  $6 million (f.o.b., 1990)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  fish, bananas, hides and skins\r\npartners:\r\n  Portugal 40%, Algeria 31%, Angola, Netherlands (1990 est.)\r\nImports:\r\n  $145 million (c.i.f., 1990)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  foodstuffs, consumer goods, industrial products, transport equipment\r\npartners:\r\n  Sweden 33%, Spain 11%, Germany 5%, Portugal 3%, France 3%,\r\n  Netherlands, US (1990 est.)\r\nExternal debt:\r\n  $156 million (1991)\r\nIndustrial production:\r\n  growth rate 18% (1988 est.);

Its economy is hobbled by political turmoil, conflict with\r\n  Libya, drought, and food shortages. Consequently the economy has shown\r\n  little progress in recent years in overcoming a severe setback brought\r\n  on by civil war in the late 1980s. Over 80% of the work force is\r\n  involved in subsistence farming and fishing. Cotton is the major cash\r\n  crop, accounting for at least half of exports. Chad is highly\r\n  dependent on foreign aid, especially food credits, given chronic\r\n  shortages in several regions. The government hopes that discovery of\r\n  several oil deposits near Lake Chad will lead to economic revival and\r\n  a windfall in government revenues by 2000.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $2.7 billion (1993 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  8.4% (1991 est.)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $500 (1993 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  2%-3% (1991 est.)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  NA%\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues:\r\n  $115 million\r\nexpenditures:\r\n  $412 million, including capital expenditures of $218 million (1991\r\n  est.)\r\nExports:\r\n  $193.9 million (f.o.b., 1991)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  cotton 48%, cattle 35%, textiles 5%, fish\r\npartners:\r\n  France, Nigeria, Cameroon\r\nImports:\r\n  $294.1 million (f.o.b., 1991)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  machinery and transportation equipment 39%, industrial goods 20%,\r\n  petroleum products 13%, foodstuffs 9%;

Under the center-left government of\r\n  President AYLWIN, which took power in March 1990, spending on social\r\n  welfare has risen steadily. At the same time business investment,\r\n  exports and consumer spending have also grown substantially. The new\r\n  president, FREI, who takes office in March 1994, is expected to\r\n  emphasize social spending even more.

To this\r\n  end the authorities switched to a system of household responsibility\r\n  in agriculture in place of the old collectivization, increased the\r\n  authority of local officials and plant managers in industry, permitted\r\n  a wide variety of small-scale enterprise in services and light\r\n  manufacturing, and opened the economy to increased foreign trade and\r\n  investment. The result has been a strong surge in production,\r\n  particularly in agriculture in the early 1980s. Industry also has\r\n  posted major gains, especially in coastal areas near Hong Kong and\r\n  opposite Taiwan, where foreign investment and modern production\r\n  methods have helped spur production of both domestic and export goods.\r\n  Aggregate output has more than doubled since 1978. On the darker side,\r\n  the leadership has often experienced in its hybrid system the worst\r\n  results of socialism (bureaucracy, lassitude, corruption) and of\r\n  capitalism (windfall gains and stepped-up inflation). Beijing thus has\r\n  periodically backtracked, retightening central controls at intervals.\r\n  In 1992-93 annual growth of GDP has accelerated, particularly in the\r\n  coastal areas - to more than 10% annually according to official\r\n  claims. In late 1993 China's leadership approved additional reforms\r\n  aimed at giving more play to market-oriented institutions and at\r\n  strengthening the center's control over the financial system. Popular\r\n  resistance, changes in central policy, and loss of authority by rural\r\n  cadres have weakened China's population control program, which is\r\n  essential to the nation's long-term economic viability.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - purchasing power equivalent -  $2.61 trillion (1993 estimate\r\n  based on a 1990 figure from the UN International Comparison Program,\r\n  as extended to 1991 and published in the World Bank's World\r\n  Development Report 1993;

Furthermore, conservative fiscal and monetary policies have\r\n  helped to steadily reduce inflation to 23% and unemployment to about\r\n  7% in 1993. The rapid development of oil, coal, and other\r\n  nontraditional industries has helped offset the decline in coffee\r\n  prices. A major oil find in 1993 in eastern Colombia may provide an\r\n  extra $3 billion annually to the economy by 1997. Increased foreign\r\n  investment and even greater domestic activity have been hampered,\r\n  however, by a troublesome rural insurgency, a decrepit energy and\r\n  transportation infrastructure, and drug-related violence. Agriculture\r\n  also has encountered problems in adjusting to fewer subsidies, greater\r\n  competition, and the collapse of the international coffee agreement,\r\n  which has kept world coffee prices at near-record lows in 1991-93.\r\n  Business construction was a leading sector in 1993. The substantial\r\n  trade deficit in 1993 was the result of a strong peso that inhibited\r\n  exports and a liberalized government policy that spurred imports.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $192 billion (1993 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  5.1% (1993 est.)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $5,500 (1993 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  22.6% (1993 est.)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  7.9% (1993 est.)\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues:\r\n  $11 billion\r\nexpenditures:\r\n  $12 billion, including capital expenditures of $2.2 billion (1993\r\n  est.)\r\nExports:\r\n  $6.9 billion (f.o.b., 1992 est.)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  petroleum, coffee, coal, bananas, fresh cut flowers\r\npartners:\r\n  US 39%, EC 25.7%, Japan 2.9%, Venezuela 8.5% (1992)\r\nImports:\r\n  $6.7 billion (c.i.f., 1992 est.)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  industrial equipment, transportation equipment, consumer goods,\r\n  chemicals, paper products\r\npartners:\r\n  US 36%, EC 18%, Brazil 4%, Venezuela 6.5%, Japan 8.7% (1992)\r\nExternal debt:\r\n  $17 billion (1992)\r\nIndustrial production:\r\n  growth rate 2% (1993 est.);

The low educational\r\n  level of the labor force contributes to a low level of economic\r\n  activity, high unemployment, and a heavy dependence on foreign grants\r\n  and technical assistance. Agriculture, including fishing, hunting, and\r\n  forestry, is the leading sector of the economy. It contributes 40% to\r\n  GDP, employs 80% of the labor force, and provides most of the exports.\r\n  The country is not self-sufficient in food production, and rice, the\r\n  main staple, accounts for 90% of imports. During 1982-86 the\r\n  industrial sector grew at an annual average rate of 5.3%, but its\r\n  contribution to GDP is small. Despite major investment in the tourist\r\n  industry, which accounts for about 25% of GDP, growth has stagnated\r\n  since 1983. A sluggish growth rate of 1.5% during 1985-90 has led to\r\n  large budget deficits, declining incomes, and balance-of-payments\r\n  difficulties. Estimates for 1992 show a moderate increase in the\r\n  growth rate based on increased exports, tourism, and government\r\n  investment outlays.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $360 million (1993 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  5% (1992 est.)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $700 (1993 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  4% (1991 est.)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  over 15.9% (1989)\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues:\r\n  $96 million\r\nexpenditures:\r\n  $88 million, including capital expenditures of $33 million (1991 est.)\r\nExports:\r\n  $21 million (f.o.b., 1992 est.)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  vanilla, cloves, perfume oil, copra, ylang-ylang\r\npartners:\r\n  US 53%, France 41%, Africa 4%, FRG 2% (1988)\r\nImports:\r\n  $60 million (f.o.b., 1992 est.)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  rice and other foodstuffs, cement, petroleum products, consumer goods\r\npartners:\r\n  Europe 62% (France 22%), Africa 5%, Pakistan, China (1988)\r\nExternal debt:\r\n  $160 million (1992 est.)\r\nIndustrial production:\r\n  growth rate -6.5% (1989 est.);

A reform\r\n  program, supported by the IMF and World Bank, ran into difficulties in\r\n  1990-91 because of problems in changing to a democratic political\r\n  regime and a heavy debt-servicing burden. Oil has supplanted forestry\r\n  as the mainstay of the economy, providing about two-thirds of\r\n  government revenues and exports. In the early 1980s rapidly rising oil\r\n  revenues enabled Congo to finance large-scale development projects\r\n  with growth averaging 5% annually, one of the highest rates in Africa.\r\n  Subsequently, growth has slowed to an average of roughly 1.5%\r\n  annually, only half the population growth rate.

Consequently, the economy is\r\n  highly sensitive to fluctuations in international prices for coffee\r\n  and cocoa and to weather conditions. Despite attempts by the\r\n  government to diversify, the economy is still largely dependent on\r\n  agriculture and related industries. The agricultural sector accounts\r\n  for over one-third of GDP and about 80% of export earnings and employs\r\n  about 85% of the labor force. A collapse of world cocoa and coffee\r\n  prices in 1986 threw the economy into a recession, from which the\r\n  country has yet to fully recover. Continuing weak prices for commodity\r\n  exports, a bloated public-sector wage bill, and a large foreign debt\r\n  will continue to constrain economic development, this despite the 50%\r\n  currency devaluation in January 1994 designed to restore international\r\n  price competitiveness. A large, non-competitive import-substitution\r\n  sector continues to thrive under steep tariff and import quota\r\n  barriers.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $21 billion (1993 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  NA\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $1,500 (1993 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  1% (1991 est.)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  14% (1985)\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues:\r\n  $2.3 billion\r\nexpenditures:\r\n  $3.6 billion, including capital expenditures of $274 million (1990\r\n  est.)\r\nExports:\r\n  $2.8 billion (f.o.b., 1990)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  cocoa 30%, coffee 20%, tropical woods 11%, petroleum, cotton, bananas,\r\n  pineapples, palm oil, cotton\r\npartners:\r\n  France, FRG, Netherlands, US, Belgium, Spain (1985)\r\nImports:\r\n  $1.6 billion (f.o.b., 1990)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  food, capital goods, consumer goods, fuel\r\npartners:\r\n  France 29%, other EC 29%, Nigeria 16%, US 4%, Japan 3% (1989)\r\nExternal debt:\r\n  $17.3 billion (1993 est.)\r\nIndustrial production:\r\n  growth rate 6% (1990);

At present, Croatian Serb\r\n  Nationalists control approximately one-third of the Croatian\r\n  territory, and one of the overriding determinants of Croatia's\r\n  long-term political and economic prospects will be the resolution of\r\n  this territorial dispute. Croatia faces monumental economic problems\r\n  stemming from: the legacy of longtime Communist mismanagement of the\r\n  economy; large foreign debt; damage during the fighting to bridges,\r\n  factories, power lines, buildings, and houses; the large refugee\r\n  population, both Croatian and Bosnian; and the disruption of economic\r\n  ties to Serbia and the other former Yugoslav republics, as well as\r\n  within its own territory. At the minimum, extensive Western aid and\r\n  investment, especially in the tourist and oil industries, would seem\r\n  necessary to salvage a desperate economic situation. However, peace\r\n  and political stability must come first; only then will recent\r\n  government moves toward a \"market-friendly\" economy reverse the sharp\r\n  drop in output. As of May 1994, fighting continues among Croats,\r\n  Serbs, and Muslims, and national boundaries and final political\r\n  arrangements are still in doubt.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $21.8 billion (1992 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  -19% (1992 est.)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $4,500 (1992 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  26% monthly average (1993 est.)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  21% (December 1993)\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues:\r\n  $NA\r\nexpenditures:\r\n  $NA, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\nExports:\r\n  $3.9 billion (f.o.b., 1993)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  machinery and transport equipment 30%, other manufacturers 37%,\r\n  chemicals 11%, food and live animals 9%, raw materials 6.5%, fuels and\r\n  lubricants 5% (1990)\r\npartners:\r\n  EC countries, Slovenia\r\nImports:\r\n  $4.7 billion (c.i.f., 1993)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  machinery and transport equipment 21%, fuels and lubricants 19%, food\r\n  and live animals 16%, chemicals 14%, manufactured goods 13%,\r\n  miscellaneous manufactured articles 9%, raw materials 6.5%, beverages\r\n  and tobacco 1% (1990)\r\npartners:\r\n  EC countries, Slovenia, FSU countries\r\nExternal debt:\r\n  $2.6 billion (December 1993)\r\nIndustrial production:\r\n  growth rate -5.9% (1993 est.)\r\nElectricity:\r\ncapacity:\r\n  3,570,000 kW\r\nproduction:\r\n  11.5 billion kWh\r\nconsumption per capita:\r\n  2,400 kWh (1992)\r\nIndustries:\r\n  chemicals and plastics, machine tools, fabricated metal, electronics,\r\n  pig iron and rolled steel products, aluminum reduction, paper, wood\r\n  products (including furniture), building materials (including cement),\r\n  textiles, shipbuilding, petroleum and petroleum refining, food\r\n  processing and beverages\r\nAgriculture:\r\n  Croatia normally produces a food surplus;

In 1989-93, GDP declined by about 40% and import\r\n  capability fell by about 80%. Reduced imports of fuel, spare parts,\r\n  and chemicals combined with rainy weather to cut the production of\r\n  sugar - the country's top export - from 7 million tons in 1992 to 4.3\r\n  million tons in 1993, causing a loss of more than $400 million in\r\n  export revenue. The government implemented several measures designed\r\n  to stem the economic decline, e.g., legalizing the use of foreign\r\n  currency by Cuban citizens in August 1993 in an attempt to increase\r\n  remittances of foreign exchange from abroad. Authorities in September\r\n  1993 began permitting self-employment in over 100 mostly service\r\n  occupations. Also in September the government broke up many state\r\n  farms into smaller, more autonomous cooperative units in an attempt to\r\n  increase worker incentives and boost depressed food production levels.\r\n  Fuel shortages persisted throughout 1993; draft animals and bicycles\r\n  continued to replace motor-driven vehicles, and the use of electricity\r\n  by households and factories was cut from already low levels. With the\r\n  help of foreign investment, tourism has been one bright spot in the\r\n  economy, with arrivals and earnings reaching record highs in 1993.\r\n  Government officials have expressed guarded optimism for 1994, as the\r\n  country struggles to achieve sustainable economic growth at a\r\n  much-reduced standard of living.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GNP - purchasing power equivalent - $13.7 billion (1993 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  -10% (1993 est.)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $1,250 (1993 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  NA%\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  NA%\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues:\r\n  $12.46 billion\r\nexpenditures:\r\n  $14.45 billion, including capital expenditures of $NA (1990 est.)\r\nExports:\r\n  $1.5 billion (f.o.b., 1993 est.)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  sugar, nickel, shellfish, tobacco, medical products, citrus, coffee\r\npartners:\r\n  Russia 28%, Canada 9%, China 5%, Ukraine 5%, Japan 4%, Spain 4% (1993\r\n  est.)\r\nImports:\r\n  $1.7 billion (c.i.f., 1993 est.)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  petroleum, food, machinery, chemicals\r\npartners:\r\n  Venezuela 20%, China 9%, Spain 9%, Mexico 7%, Italy 4%, Canada 7%,\r\n  France 8% (1993 est.)\r\nExternal debt:\r\n  $6.8 billion (convertible currency, July 1989)\r\nIndustrial production:\r\n  growth rate NA%\r\nElectricity:\r\ncapacity:\r\n  3,889,000 kW\r\nproduction:\r\n  16.248 billion kWh\r\nconsumption per capita:\r\n  1,500 kWh (1992)\r\nIndustries:\r\n  sugar milling and refining, petroleum refining, food and tobacco\r\n  processing, textiles, chemicals, paper and wood products, metals\r\n  (particularly nickel), cement, fertilizers, consumer goods,\r\n  agricultural machinery\r\nAgriculture:\r\n  accounts for 11% of GNP (including fishing and forestry);

An average 6.8% rise in real GDP between 1986 and 1990\r\n  was temporarily checked in 1991, because of the adverse effects of the\r\n  Gulf War on tourism. Economic growth surged again in 1992, bolstered\r\n  by strong foreign and domestic demand. As the economy gained momentum,\r\n  however, it began to overheat; inflation reached 6.5%. The economy has\r\n  likely recorded a sharp drop in growth in 1993, due to the recession\r\n  in Western Europe, Cyprus' main trading partner, but probably will\r\n  pick up again in 1994. The Turkish Cypriot economy has less than\r\n  one-third the per capita GDP in the south. Because it is recognized\r\n  only by Turkey, it has had much difficulty arranging foreign\r\n  financing, and foreign firms have hesitated to invest there. The\r\n  economy remains heavily dependent on agriculture, which employs more\r\n  than one-quarter of the workforce. Moreover, because the Turkish lira\r\n  is legal tender, the Turkish Cypriot economy has suffered the same\r\n  high inflation as mainland Turkey. To compensate for the economy's\r\n  weakness, Turkey provides direct and indirect aid to nearly every\r\n  sector; financial support has reached about one-third of Turkish\r\n  Cypriot GDP.\r\nNational product:\r\nGreek area:\r\n  GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $6.7 billion (1992)\r\nTurkish area:\r\n  GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $550 million (1992)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\nGreek area:\r\n  8.2% (1992)\r\nTurkish area:\r\n  7.3% (1992)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\nGreek area:\r\n  $11,390 (1992)\r\nTurkish area:\r\n  $3,130 (1992)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\nGreek area:\r\n  6.5% (1992)\r\nTurkish area:\r\n  63.4% (1992)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\nGreek area:\r\n  1.8% (1992)\r\nTurkish area:\r\n  1.2% (1992)\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues:\r\n  Greek area - $1.7 billion\r\n  Turkish area -  $273 million\r\nexpenditures:\r\n  Greek area - $2.2 billion, including capital expenditures of $350\r\n  million\r\n  Turkish area - $360 million, including capital expenditures of $78\r\n  million (1994)\r\nExports:\r\n  $1.1 billion (f.o.b., 1993 est.)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  citrus, potatoes, grapes, wine, cement, clothing and shoes\r\npartners:\r\n  UK 19%, Greece 8%, Lebanon 2%, Egypt 7%\r\nImports:\r\n  $3.3 billion (f.o.b., 1993 est.)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  consumer goods, petroleum and lubricants, food and feed grains,\r\n  machinery\r\npartners:\r\n  UK 11%, Japan 11%, Italy 10%, Germany 9%, US 8%\r\nExternal debt:\r\n  $1.6 billion (1992)\r\nIndustrial production:\r\n  growth rate 4% (1993 est.);

The\r\n  old Czechoslovakia, even though highly industrialized by East European\r\n  standards, suffered from an aging capital plant, lagging technology,\r\n  and a deficiency in energy and many raw materials. In January 1991,\r\n  approximately one year after the end of communist control of Eastern\r\n  Europe, the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic launched a sweeping\r\n  program to convert its almost entirely state-owned and controlled\r\n  economy to a market system. In 1991-92 these measures resulted in\r\n  privatization of some medium- and small-scale economic activity and\r\n  the setting of more than 90% of prices by the market - but at a cost\r\n  in inflation, unemployment, and lower output. For Czechoslovakia as a\r\n  whole inflation in 1991 was roughly 50% and output fell 15%. In 1992,\r\n  in the Czech lands, inflation dropped to an estimated 12.5% and GDP\r\n  was down a more moderate 5%. In 1993, Czech aggregate output remained\r\n  unchanged, prices rose about 19%, and unemployment hovered above 3%;\r\n  exports to Slovakia fell roughly 30%. An estimated 40% of the economy\r\n  was privately owned. In 1994, Prague expects 2% to 3% growth in GDP,\r\n  roughly 9% inflation, and 5% unemployment. Economic growth in 1994 is\r\n  less important than continued economic restructuring; a mere 1% growth\r\n  would be noteworthy if restructuring is accompanied by rising\r\n  unemployment and enterprise bankruptcies.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $75 billion (1993 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  0% (1993 est.)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $7,200 (1993 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  19% (1993 est.)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  3.3% (1993 est.)\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues:\r\n  $11.9 billion\r\nexpenditures:\r\n  $11.9 billion, including capital expenditures of $NA (1993 est.)\r\nExports:\r\n  $12.6 billion (f.o.b., 1993 est.)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  manufactured goods, machinery and transport equipment, chemicals,\r\n  fuels, minerals, and metals\r\npartners:\r\n  Germany, Slovakia, Poland, Austria, Hungary, Italy, France, US, UK,\r\n  CIS republics\r\nImports:\r\n  $12.4 billion (f.o.b., 1993 est.)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  machinery and transport equipment, fuels and lubricants, manfactured\r\n  goods, raw materials, chemicals, agricultural products\r\npartners:\r\n  Slovakia, CIS republics, Germany, Austria, Poland, Switzerland,\r\n  Hungary, UK, Italy\r\nExternal debt:\r\n  $8.6 billion (October 1993)\r\nIndustrial production:\r\n  growth rate -5.5% (December 1993 over December 1992)\r\nElectricity:\r\ncapacity:\r\n  16,500,000 kW\r\nproduction:\r\n  62.2 billion kWh\r\nconsumption per capita:\r\n  6,030 kWh (1992)\r\nIndustries:\r\n  fuels, ferrous metallurgy, machinery and equipment, coal, motor\r\n  vehicles, glass, armaments\r\nAgriculture:\r\n  largely self-sufficient in food production;

Denmark's new center-left coalition government will concentrate\r\n  on reducing the persistent high unemployment rate and the budget\r\n  deficit as well as following the previous government's policies of\r\n  maintaining low inflation and a current account surplus. In the face\r\n  of recent international market pressure on the Danish krone, the\r\n  coalition has also vowed to maintain a stable currency. The coalition\r\n  hopes to lower marginal income taxes while maintaining overall tax\r\n  revenues; boost industrial competitiveness through labor market and\r\n  tax reforms and increased research and development funds; and improve\r\n  welfare services for the neediest while cutting paperwork and delays.\r\n  Prime Minister RASMUSSEN's reforms will focus on adapting Denmark to\r\n  the criteria for European integration by 1999; although Copenhagen has\r\n  won from the European Union (EU) the right to opt out of the European\r\n  Monetary Union (EMU) if a national referendum rejects it. Denmark is,\r\n  in fact, one of the few EU countries likely to fit into the EMU on\r\n  time. Denmark is weathering the current worldwide slump better than\r\n  many West European countries. As the EU's single market (formally\r\n  established on 1 January 1993) gets underway, Danish economic growth\r\n  is expected to pickup to around 2% in 1994. Danish approval of the\r\n  Maastricht treaty on EU political and economic union in May 1993 has\r\n  reversed the drop in investment, further boosting growth. The current\r\n  account surplus remains strong as limitations on wage increases and\r\n  low inflation - expected to be around 2% in 1994 - improve export\r\n  competitiveness. Although unemployment is high, it remains stable\r\n  compared to most European countries.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $95.6 billion (1993)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  0.5% (1993)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $18,500 (1993)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  1.8% (1993 est.)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  11.8% (1993 est.)\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues:\r\n  $48 billion\r\nexpenditures:\r\n  $55.7 billion, including capital expenditures of $NA (1993)\r\nExports:\r\n  $36.7 billion (f.o.b., 1993)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  meat and meat products, dairy products, transport equipment\r\n  (shipbuilding), fish, chemicals, industrial machinery\r\npartners:\r\n  EC 54.3% (Germany 23.6%, UK 10.1%, France 5.7%), Sweden 10.5%, Norway\r\n  5.8%, US 4.9%, Japan 3.6% (1992)\r\nImports:\r\n  $29.7 billion (c.i.f., 1993 est.)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  petroleum, machinery and equipment, chemicals, grain and foodstuffs,\r\n  textiles, paper\r\npartners:\r\n  EC 53.4% (Germany 23.1%, UK 8.2%, France 5.6%), Sweden 10.8%, Norway\r\n  5.4%, US 5.7%, Japan 4.1% (1992)\r\nExternal debt:\r\n  $40 billion (1992 est.)\r\nIndustrial production:\r\n  growth rate -2.5% (1993 est.)\r\nElectricity:\r\ncapacity:\r\n  11,215,000 kW\r\nproduction:\r\n  34.17 billion kWh\r\nconsumption per capita:\r\n  6,610 kWh (1992)\r\nIndustries:\r\n  food processing, machinery and equipment, textiles and clothing,\r\n  chemical products, electronics, construction, furniture, and other\r\n  wood products, shipbuilding\r\nAgriculture:\r\n  accounts for 4% of GDP and employs 5.6% of labor force (includes\r\n  fishing and forestry);

Djibouti provides services as both a transit port\r\n  for the region and an international transshipment and refueling\r\n  center. It has few natural resources and little industry. The nation\r\n  is, therefore, heavily dependent on foreign assistance (an important\r\n  supplement to GDP) to help support its balance of payments and to\r\n  finance development projects. An unemployment rate of over 30%\r\n  continues to be a major problem. Per capita consumption dropped an\r\n  estimated 35% over the last five years because of recession, civil\r\n  war, and a high population growth rate (including immigrants and\r\n  refugees).\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $500 million (1993 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  -1% (1992 est.)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $1,200 (1993 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  6% (1992)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  over 30% (1989)\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues:\r\n  $170 million\r\nexpenditures:\r\n  $203 million, including capital expenditures of $70 million (1991\r\n  est.)\r\nExports:\r\n  $158 million (f.o.b., 1992 est.)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  hides and skins, coffee (in transit)\r\npartners:\r\n  Africa 47%, Middle East 40%, Western Europe 12%\r\nImports:\r\n  $334 million (f.o.b., 1992 est.)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  foods, beverages, transport equipment, chemicals, petroleum products\r\npartners:\r\n  Western Europe 48%, Asia 25%, Africa 8%\r\nExternal debt:\r\n  $355 million (December 1990)\r\nIndustrial production:\r\n  growth rate 3% (1991 est.);

Over the past\r\n  decade, tourism has also increased in importance and is a major earner\r\n  of foreign exchange and a source of new jobs. Agriculture remains a\r\n  key sector of the economy. The principal commercial crop is sugarcane,\r\n  followed by coffee, cotton, cocoa, and tobacco. Domestic industry is\r\n  based on the processing of agricultural products, oil refining,\r\n  minerals, and chemicals. Unemployment is officially reported at about\r\n  30%, but there is considerable underemployment. Growth fell to a\r\n  moderate 3% in 1993 because of power shortages in industry and\r\n  political uncertainty which slowed down foreign investment.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $23 billion (1993 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  3% (1993 est.)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $3,000 (1993 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  8% (1993 est.)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  30% (1993 est.)\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues:\r\n  $1.4 billion\r\nexpenditures:\r\n  $1.8 billion, including capital expenditures of $NA (1993 est.)\r\nExports:\r\n  $769 million (f.o.b., 1993)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  ferronickel, sugar, gold, coffee, cocoa\r\npartners:\r\n  US 56%, EC 22%, Puerto Rico 8% (1991)\r\nImports:\r\n  $2.2 billion (c.i.f., 1993 est.)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  foodstuffs, petroleum, cotton and fabrics, chemicals and\r\n  pharmaceuticals\r\npartners:\r\n  US 50%\r\nExternal debt:\r\n  $4.7 billion (1993 est.)\r\nIndustrial production:\r\n  growth rate -0.1% (1991);

The new\r\n  President Sixto DURAN-BALLEN, has a much more favorable attitude\r\n  toward foreign investment than did his predecessor. Ecuador has\r\n  implemented trade agreements with Colombia, Peru, Bolivia, and\r\n  Venezuela and has applied for GATT membership. At the end of 1991,\r\n  Ecuador received a standby IMF loan of $105 million, which will permit\r\n  the country to proceed with the rescheduling of Paris Club debt. In\r\n  September 1992, the government launched a new, macroeconomic program\r\n  that gives more play to market forces. In 1993, the DURAN-BALLEN\r\n  administration adopted a rigorous austerity program that resulted in\r\n  economic stabilization, with inflation cut in half and international\r\n  reserves boosted to a record $1.3 billion. Growth in 1993 was perhaps\r\n  only 2% due to falling export prices, notably oil, and slow progress\r\n  on privatization.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $41.8 billion\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  2% (1993 est.)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $4,000 (1993 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  31% (1993)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  8% (1992)\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues:\r\n  $1.9 billion\r\nexpenditures:\r\n  $1.9 billion, including capital expenditures of $NA (1992)\r\nExports:\r\n  $3 billion (f.o.b., 1992)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  petroleum 42%, bananas, shrimp, cocoa, coffee\r\npartners:\r\n  US 53.4%, Latin America, Caribbean, EC countries\r\nImports:\r\n  $2.5 billion (f.o.b., 1992)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  transport equipment, vehicles, machinery, chemicals\r\npartners:\r\n  US 32.7%, Latin America, Caribbean, EC countries, Japan\r\nExternal debt:\r\n  $12.7 billion (1992)\r\nIndustrial production:\r\n  growth rate 3.9% (1991);

Even so, the economy grew rapidly during the late 1970s\r\n  and early 1980s, but in 1986 the collapse of world oil prices and an\r\n  increasingly heavy burden of debt servicing led Egypt to begin\r\n  negotiations with the IMF for balance-of-payments support. Egypt's\r\n  first IMF standby arrangement concluded in mid-1987 was suspended in\r\n  early 1988 because of the government's failure to adopt promised\r\n  reforms. Egypt signed a follow-on program with the IMF and also\r\n  negotiated a structural adjustment loan with the World Bank in 1991.\r\n  In 1991-93 the government made solid progress on administrative\r\n  reforms such as liberalizing exchange and interest rates but resisted\r\n  implementing major structural reforms like streamlining the public\r\n  sector. As a result, the economy has not gained momentum and\r\n  unemployment has become a growing problem. Egypt probably will\r\n  continue making uneven progress in implementing the successor programs\r\n  with the IMF and World Bank it signed onto in late 1993. In 1992-93\r\n  tourism plunged 20% or so because of sporadic attacks by Islamic\r\n  extremists on tourist groups. President MUBARAK has cited population\r\n  growth as the main cause of the country's economic troubles.

Subsistence farming predominates. Although\r\n  pre-independence Equatorial Guinea counted on cocoa production for\r\n  hard currency earnings, the deterioration of the rural economy under\r\n  successive brutal regimes has diminished potential for agriculture-led\r\n  growth. A number of AID programs sponsored by the World Bank and the\r\n  international donor community have failed to revitalize export\r\n  agriculture. There is little industry; businesses for the most part\r\n  are owned by government officials and their family members. Commerce\r\n  accounts for about 8% of GDP and the construction, public works, and\r\n  service sectors for about 38%. Undeveloped natural resources include\r\n  titanium, iron ore, manganese, uranium, and alluvial gold. Oil\r\n  exploration, taking place under concessions offered to US, French, and\r\n  Spanish firms, has been moderately successful. Increased production\r\n  from recently discovered natural gas fields will provide a greater\r\n  share of exports by 1995.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $280 million (1993 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  NA\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $700 (1993 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  1.6% (1992 est.)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  NA%\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues:\r\n  $32.5 million\r\nexpenditures:\r\n  $35.9 million, including capital expenditures of $3 million (1992\r\n  est.)\r\nExports:\r\n  $52.8 million (f.o.b., 1992)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  coffee, timber, cocoa beans\r\npartners:\r\n  Spain 55.2%, Nigeria 11.4%, Cameroon 9.1% (1992)\r\nImports:\r\n  $63.6 million (c.i.f., 1992)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  petroleum, food, beverages, clothing, machinery\r\npartners:\r\n  Cameroon 23.1%, Spain 21.8%, France 14.1%, US 4.3%\r\nExternal debt:\r\n  $260 million (1992 est)\r\nIndustrial production:\r\n  growth rate -6.5% (1992 est.);

Government revenues come from custom duties and income and\r\n  sales taxes. Eritrea has inherited the entire coastline of Ethiopia\r\n  and has long-term prospects for revenues from the development of\r\n  offshore oil, offshore fishing and tourism. For the time being,\r\n  Ethiopia will be largely dependent on Eritrean ports for its foreign\r\n  trade.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $1.7 billion (1993 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  NA%\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $500 (1993 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  NA%\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  NA%\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues:\r\n  $NA\r\nexpenditures:\r\n  $NA, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\nExports:\r\n  $NA\r\ncommodities:\r\n  NA\r\npartners:\r\n  NA\r\nImports:\r\n  $NA\r\ncommodities:\r\n  NA\r\npartners:\r\n  NA\r\nExternal debt:\r\n  $NA\r\nIndustrial production:\r\n  growth rate NA%\r\nElectricity:\r\ncapacity:\r\n  NA kW\r\nproduction:\r\n  NA kWh\r\nconsumption per capita:\r\n  NA kWh\r\nIndustries:\r\n  food processing, beverages, clothing and textiles\r\nAgriculture:\r\n  products - sorghum, livestock (including goats), fish, lentils,\r\n  vegetables, maize, cotton, tobacco, coffee, sisal (for making rope)\r\nEconomic aid:\r\n  $NA\r\nCurrency:\r\n  1 birr (Br) = 100 cents;

Two years after independence - and one year\r\n  after the introduction of the kroon - Estonians are beginning to reap\r\n  tangible benefits; inflation is low; production declines appear to\r\n  have bottomed out; and living standards are rising. Economic\r\n  restructuring is clearly underway with the once-dominant\r\n  energy-intensive heavy industrial sectors giving way to\r\n  labor-intensive light industry and the underdeveloped service sector.\r\n  The private sector is growing rapidly; the share of the state\r\n  enterprises in retail trade has steadily declined and by June 1993\r\n  accounted for only 12.5% of total turnover, and 70,000 new jobs have\r\n  reportedly been created as a result of new business start-ups.\r\n  Estonia's foreign trade has shifted rapidly from East to West with the\r\n  Western industrialized countries now accounting for two-thirds of\r\n  foreign trade.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $8.8 billion (1993 estimate from\r\n  the UN International Comparison Program, as extended to 1991 and\r\n  published in the World Bank's World Development Report 1993;

(The accompanying analysis and figures\r\n  predate the independence of Eritrea.) Its economy is based on\r\n  subsistence agriculture, which accounts for about 45% of GDP, 90% of\r\n  exports, and 80% of total employment; coffee generates 60% of export\r\n  earnings. The manufacturing sector is heavily dependent on inputs from\r\n  the agricultural sector. Over 90% of large-scale industry, but less\r\n  than 10% of agriculture, is state run; the government is considering\r\n  selling off a portion of state-owned plants. Favorable agricultural\r\n  weather largely explains the 4.5% growth in output in FY89, whereas\r\n  drought and deteriorating internal security conditions prevented\r\n  growth in FY90. In 1991 the lack of law and order, particularly in the\r\n  south, interfered with economic development and growth. In 1992,\r\n  because of some easing of civil strife and aid from the outside world,\r\n  the economy substantially improved.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $22.7 billion (1993 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  7.8% (FY93 est)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $400 (1993 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  21% (1992 est)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  NA%\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues:\r\n  $NA\r\nexpenditures:\r\n  $1.2 billion, including capital expenditures of $NA (1992 est.)\r\nExports:\r\n  $189 million (f.o.b., FY91)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  coffee, leather products, gold, petroleum products\r\npartners:\r\n  Germany, Japan, Saudi Arabia, France, Italy\r\nImports:\r\n  $472 million (c.i.f., FY91)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  capital goods, consumer goods, fuel\r\npartners:\r\n  US, Germany, Italy, Saudi Arabia, Japan\r\nExternal debt:\r\n  $3.48 billion (1991)\r\nIndustrial production:\r\n  growth rate -3.3% (FY92);

A few dairy herds are kept to meet\r\n  domestic consumption of milk and milk products, and crops grown are\r\n  primarily those for providing winter fodder. Exports feature shipments\r\n  of high-grade wool to the UK and the sale of postage stamps and coins.\r\n  Rich stocks of fish in the surrounding waters are not presently\r\n  exploited by the islanders. So far, efforts to establish a domestic\r\n  fishing industry have been unsuccessful. In 1987 the government began\r\n  selling fishing licenses to foreign trawlers operating within the\r\n  Falklands exclusive fishing zone. These license fees amount to more\r\n  than $40 million per year and are a primary source of income for the\r\n  government. To encourage tourism, the Falkland Islands Development\r\n  Corporation has built three lodges for visitors attracted by the\r\n  abundant wildlife and trout fishing.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP $NA\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  NA%\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $NA\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  7.4% (1980-87 average)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  NA%;

When the nations of the world\r\n  extended their fishing zones to 200 nautical miles in the early 1970s,\r\n  the Faroese no longer could continue their traditional long-distance\r\n  fishing and subsequently depleted their own nearby fishing areas. The\r\n  government's tight controls on fish stocks and its austerity measures\r\n  have caused a recession, and subsidy cuts will force nationalization\r\n  in the fishing industry, which has already been plagued with\r\n  bankruptcies. Copenhagen has threatened to withhold its annual subsidy\r\n  of $130 million - roughly one-third of the islands' budget revenues -\r\n  unless the Faroese make significant efforts to balance their budget.\r\n  To this extent the Faroe government is expected to continue its tough\r\n  policies, including introducing a 20% value-added tax (VAT) in 1993,\r\n  and has agreed to an IMF economic-political stabilization plan. In\r\n  addition to its annual subsidy, the Danish government has bailed out\r\n  the second largest Faroe bank to the tune of $140 million since\r\n  October 1992.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $662 million (1989 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  3% (1989 est.)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $14,000 (1989 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  2% (1988)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  2.5% (1993 est)\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues:\r\n  $425 million\r\nexpenditures:\r\n  $480 million, including capital expenditures of $NA (1991 est.)\r\nExports:\r\n  $386 million (f.o.b., 1990 est.)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  fish and fish products 88%, animal feedstuffs, transport equipment\r\n  (ships) (1989)\r\npartners:\r\n  Denmark 20%, Germany 18.3%, UK 14.2%, France 11.2%, Spain 7.9%, US\r\n  4.5%\r\nImports:\r\n  $322 million (c.i.f., 1990 est.)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  machinery and transport equipment 24.4%, manufactures 24%, food and\r\n  livestock 19%, fuels 12%, chemicals 6.5%\r\npartners:\r\n  Denmark 43.8%, Norway 19.8%, Sweden 4.9%, Germany 4.2%, US 1.3%\r\nExternal debt:\r\n  $1.3 billion (1991)\r\nIndustrial production:\r\n  growth rate NA%\r\nElectricity:\r\ncapacity:\r\n  80,000 kW\r\nproduction:\r\n  280 million kWh\r\nconsumption per capita:\r\n  5,760 kWh (1992)\r\nIndustries:\r\n  fishing, shipbuilding, handicrafts\r\nAgriculture:\r\n  accounts for 27% of GDP and employs 27% of labor force;

Sugar exports and tourism are the major sources of foreign\r\n  exchange. Industry contributes 13% to GDP, with sugar processing\r\n  accounting for one-third of industrial activity. Roughly 250,000\r\n  tourists visit each year. Political uncertainty and drought, however,\r\n  contribute to substantial fluctuations in earnings from tourism and\r\n  sugar. In 1992, growth was approximately 3%, based on growth in\r\n  tourism and a lessening of labor-management disputes in the sugar and\r\n  gold-mining sectors. In 1993, the government's budgeted growth rate of\r\n  3% was not achieved because of a decline in non-sugar agricultural\r\n  output and damage from Cyclone Kina.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $3 billion (1993 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  1% (1993 est.)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $4,000 (1993 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  5.6% (1993 est.)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  5.9% (1991 est.)\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues:\r\n  $455 million\r\nexpenditures:\r\n  $546 million, including capital expenditures of $NA (1993 est.)\r\nExports:\r\n  $417 million (f.o.b., 1992)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  sugar 40%, clothing, processed fish, gold, lumber\r\npartners:\r\n  EC 26%, Australia 15%, Pacific Islands 11%, Japan 6%\r\nImports:\r\n  $517 million (c.i.f., 1992 est)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  machinery and transport equipment, petroleum products, food, consumer\r\n  goods, chemicals\r\npartners:\r\n  Australia 30%, NZ 17%, Japan 13%, EC 6%, US 6%\r\nExternal debt:\r\n  $670 million (1994 est.)\r\nIndustrial production:\r\n  growth rate 7.5% (1992 est.);

Its key economic sector\r\n  is manufacturing - principally the wood, metals, and engineering\r\n  industries. Trade is important, with the export of goods representing\r\n  about 30% of GDP. Except for timber and several minerals, Finland\r\n  depends on imports of raw materials, energy, and some components for\r\n  manufactured goods. Because of the climate, agricultural development\r\n  is limited to maintaining self-sufficiency in basic products. The\r\n  economy, which experienced an average of 4.9% annual growth between\r\n  1987 and 1989, sank into deep recession in 1991 as growth contracted\r\n  by 6.5%. The recession - which continued in 1992 with growth\r\n  contracting by 4.1% - has been caused by economic overheating,\r\n  depressed foreign markets, and the dismantling of the barter system\r\n  between Finland and the former Soviet Union under which Soviet oil and\r\n  gas had been exchanged for Finnish manufactured goods. The Finnish\r\n  Government has proposed efforts to increase industrial competitiveness\r\n  and efficiency by an increase in exports to Western markets, cuts in\r\n  public expenditures, partial privatization of state enterprises, and\r\n  changes in monetary policy. In June 1991 Helsinki had tied the markka\r\n  to the European Union's (EU) European Currency Unit (ECU) to promote\r\n  stability. Ongoing speculation resulting from a lack of confidence in\r\n  the government's policies forced Helsinki to devalue the markka by\r\n  about 12% in November 1991 and to indefinitely break the link in\r\n  September 1992. The devaluations have boosted the competitiveness of\r\n  Finnish exports to the extent the recession bottomed out in 1993 with\r\n  renewed economic growth expected in 1994. Unemployment probably will\r\n  remain a serious problem during the next few years, with the majority\r\n  of Finnish firms facing a weak domestic market and the troubled German\r\n  and Swedish export markets. Declining revenues, increased transfer\r\n  payments, and extensive funding to bail out the banking system pushed\r\n  the central government's budget deficit to nearly 13% in 1993.\r\n  Helsinki continues to harmonize its economic policies with those of\r\n  the EU during Finland's current EU membership bid. In early 1995,\r\n  Finland is expected to join the European Union (formerly the European\r\n  Community), thus broadening European economic unity.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $81.1 billion (1993)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  -2.6% (1993)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $16,100 (1993)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  2.1% (1992)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  22% (1993)\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues:\r\n  $26.8 billion\r\nexpenditures:\r\n  $40.6 billion, including capital expenditures of $NA (1992)\r\nExports:\r\n  $23.4 billion (f.o.b., 1993)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  timber, paper and pulp, ships, machinery, clothing and footwear\r\npartners:\r\n  EC 53.2% (Germany 15.6%, UK 10.7%), EFTA 19.5% (Sweden 12.8%), US\r\n  5.9%, Japan 1.3%, Russia 2.8% (1992)\r\nImports:\r\n  $18 billion (c.i.f., 1993 est.)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  foodstuffs, petroleum and petroleum products, chemicals, transport\r\n  equipment, iron and steel, machinery, textile yarn and fabrics, fodder\r\n  grains\r\npartners:\r\n  EC 47.2% (Germany 16.9%, UK 8.7%), EFTA 19.0% (Sweden 11.7%), US 6.1%,\r\n  Japan 5.5%, Russia 7.1% (1992)\r\nExternal debt:\r\n  $30 billion (December 1993)\r\nIndustrial production:\r\n  growth rate 7.6% (1992 est.)\r\nElectricity:\r\ncapacity:\r\n  13,500,000 kW\r\nproduction:\r\n  55.3 billion kWh\r\nconsumption per capita:\r\n  11,050 kWh (1992)\r\nIndustries:\r\n  metal products, shipbuilding, forestry and wood processing (pulp,\r\n  paper), copper refining, foodstuffs, chemicals, textiles, clothing\r\nAgriculture:\r\n  accounts for 5% of GDP (including forestry);

Large tracts of fertile land, the application of modern\r\n  technology, and subsidies have combined to make it the leading\r\n  agricultural producer in Western Europe. Largely self-sufficient in\r\n  agricultural products, France is a major exporter of wheat and dairy\r\n  products. The industrial sector generates about one-quarter of GDP,\r\n  and the growing services sector has become crucial to the economy.\r\n  Although French GDP contracted by 0.7% in 1993, the economy showed\r\n  signs of life by yearend. GDP growth, however, will remain sluggish in\r\n  1994 - perhaps reaching only 1.0%. Rapidly increasing unemployment\r\n  will still pose a major problem for the government. Paris remains\r\n  committed to maintaining the franc-deutsche mark parity, which has\r\n  kept French interest rates high despite France's low inflation.\r\n  Although the pace of economic integration within the European\r\n  Community has slowed down, integration presumably will remain a major\r\n  force shaping the fortunes of the various economic sectors.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $1.05 trillion (1993)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  -0.7% (1993)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $18,200 (1993)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  2.1% (1993)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  12.2% (May 1994)\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues:\r\n  $220.5 billion\r\nexpenditures:\r\n  $249.1 billion, including capital expenditures of $47 billion (1993\r\n  budget)\r\nExports:\r\n  $270.5 billion (f.o.b., 1993)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  machinery and transportation equipment, chemicals, foodstuffs,\r\n  agricultural products, iron and steel products, textiles and clothing\r\npartners:\r\n  Germany 18.6%, Italy 11.0%, Spain 11.0%, Belgium-Luxembourg 9.1%, UK\r\n  8.8%, Netherlands 7.9%, US 6.4%, Japan 2.0%, former USSR 0.7% (1991\r\n  est.)\r\nImports:\r\n  $250.2 billion (c.i.f., 1993)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  crude oil, machinery and equipment, agricultural products, chemicals,\r\n  iron and steel products\r\npartners:\r\n  Germany 17.8%, Italy 10.9%, US 9.5%, Netherlands 8.9%, Spain 8.8%,\r\n  Belgium-Luxembourg 8.5%, UK 7.5%, Japan 4.1%, former USSR 1.3% (1991\r\n  est.)\r\nExternal debt:\r\n  $300 billion (1993 est.)\r\nIndustrial production:\r\n  growth rate -4.3% (1993)\r\nElectricity:\r\ncapacity:\r\n  110 million kW\r\nproduction:\r\n  426 billion kWh\r\nconsumption per capita:\r\n  7,430 kWh (1992)\r\nIndustries:\r\n  steel, machinery, chemicals, automobiles, metallurgy, aircraft,\r\n  electronics, mining, textiles, food processing, tourism\r\nAgriculture:\r\n  accounts for 4% of GDP (including fishing and forestry);

Besides the French space center at Kourou, fishing and\r\n  forestry are the most important economic activities, with exports of\r\n  fish and fish products (mostly shrimp) accounting for more than 60% of\r\n  total revenue in 1992. The large reserves of tropical hardwoods, not\r\n  fully exploited, support an expanding sawmill industry that provides\r\n  sawn logs for export. Cultivation of crops - rice, cassava, bananas,\r\n  and sugar cane - is limited to the coastal area, where the population\r\n  is largely concentrated. French Guiana is heavily dependent on imports\r\n  of food and energy.

Gabon depended on timber and manganese until oil was\r\n  discovered offshore in the early 1970s. The oil sector now accounts\r\n  for 50% of GNP. Real growth was feeble in 1992 and Gabon continues to\r\n  face weak prices for its timber, manganese, and uranium exports.\r\n  Despite an abundance of natural wealth, and a manageable rate of\r\n  population growth, the economy is hobbled by poor fiscal management.\r\n  In 1992, the fiscal deficit widened to 2.4% of GDP, and Gabon failed\r\n  to settled arrears on its bilateral debt, leading to a cancellation of\r\n  rescheduling agreements with official and private creditors.\r\n  Devaluation of the local currency by 50% in January 1994 could set off\r\n  an inflationary spiral if the government fails to reign in spending\r\n  and grants large wage increases to an already overpaid public sector\r\n  workforce.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $5.4 billion (1993 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  0.5% (1992 est.)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $4,800 (1993 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  0.7% (1991 est.)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  NA%\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues:\r\n  $1.3 billion\r\nexpenditures:\r\n  $1.5 billion, including capital expenditures of $272 million (1992\r\n  est.)\r\nExports:\r\n  $2.3 billion (f.o.b., 1992 est)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  crude oil 80%, timber 9%, manganese 7%, uranium 2%\r\npartners:\r\n  France 48%, US 15%, Germany 2%, Japan 2%\r\nImports:\r\n  $702 million (c.i.f., 1992 est.)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  foodstuffs, chemical products, petroleum products, construction\r\n  materials, manufactures, machinery\r\npartners:\r\n  France 64%, African countries 7%, US 5%, Japan 3%\r\nExternal debt:\r\n  $4.4 billion (1991)\r\nIndustrial production:\r\n  growth rate -10% (1988 est.);

It is one of the world's poorest\r\n  countries with a per capita income of roughly $800. About 75% of the\r\n  population is engaged in crop production and livestock raising, which\r\n  contribute 30% to GDP. Small-scale manufacturing activity - processing\r\n  peanuts, fish, and hides - accounts for less than 10% of GDP. A\r\n  sustained structural adjustment program, including a liberalized trade\r\n  policy, has fostered a respectable 4% rate of growth in recent years.\r\n  Re-export trade constitutes one-third of economic activity; however,\r\n  border closures associated with Senegal's monetary crisis in late 1993\r\n  led to a 50% decline in re-export trade, reducing government revenues\r\n  in turn. Devaluation of the CFA franc in January 1994 has made\r\n  Senegalese goods more competitive, and is likely to prompt a\r\n  relaxation of Senegalese controls, paving the way for a comeback in\r\n  re-exports.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $740 million (1993 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  4.5% (FY92 est)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $800 (1993 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  5% (FY 92 est.)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  NA%\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues:\r\n  $94 million\r\nexpenditures:\r\n  $80 million, including capital expenditures of $25 million (FY91 est.)\r\nExports:\r\n  $164 million (f.o.b., FY92 est.)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  peanuts and peanut products, fish, cotton lint, palm kernels\r\npartners:\r\n  Japan 60%, Europe 29%, Africa 5%, US 1%, other 5% (1989)\r\nImports:\r\n  $214 million (f.o.b., FY92 est.)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  foodstuffs, manufactures, raw materials, fuel, machinery and transport\r\n  equipment\r\npartners:\r\n  Europe 57%, Asia 25%, USSR and Eastern Europe 9%, US 6%, other 3%\r\n  (1989)\r\nExternal debt:\r\n  $336 million (December 1990 est.)\r\nIndustrial production:\r\n  growth rate 6.7% (year NA); accounts for 5.8% of GDP (FY90)\r\nElectricity:\r\ncapacity:\r\n  30,000 kW\r\nproduction:\r\n  65 million kWh\r\nconsumption per capita:\r\n  75 kWh (1991)\r\nIndustries:\r\n  peanut processing, tourism, beverages, agricultural machinery\r\n  assembly, woodworking, metalworking, clothing\r\nAgriculture:\r\n  accounts for 30% of GDP and employs about 75% of the population;\r\n  imports one-third of food requirements; major export crop is peanuts;\r\n  other principal crops - millet, sorghum, rice, corn, cassava, palm\r\n  kernels; livestock - cattle, sheep, goats; forestry and fishing\r\n  resources not fully exploited\r\nEconomic aid:\r\nrecipient:\r\n  US commitments, including Ex-Im (FY70-89), $93 million; Western\r\n  (non-US) countries, ODA and OOF bilateral commitments (1970-89), $535\r\n  million; Communist countries (1970-89), $39 million\r\nCurrency:\r\n  1 dalasi (D) = 100 butut\r\nExchange rates:\r\n  dalasi (D) per US$1 - 9.440 (November 1993), 8.888 (1992), 8.803\r\n  (1991), 7.883 (1990), 7.5846 (1989), 6.7086 (1988)\r\nFiscal year:\r\n  1 July - 30 June\r\n\r\n@The Gambia, Communications\r\n\r\nHighways:\r\ntotal:\r\n  3,083 km\r\npaved:\r\n  431 km\r\nunpaved:\r\n  gravel, crushed stone 501 km; unimproved earth 2,151 km\r\nInland waterways:\r\n  400 km\r\nPorts:\r\n  Banjul\r\nMerchant marine:\r\n  1 bulk ship (1,000 GRT or over) totaling 11,194 GRT/19,394 DWT\r\nAirports:\r\ntotal:\r\n  1\r\nusable:\r\n  1\r\nwith permanent-surface runways:\r\n  1\r\nwith runways over 3,659 m:\r\n  0\r\nwith runways 2,440-3,659 m:\r\n  1\r\nwith runways 1,220-2,439 m:\r\n  0\r\nTelecommunications:\r\n  adequate network of radio relay and wire; 3,500 telephones; broadcast\r\n  stations - 3 AM, 2 FM; 1 Atlantic Ocean INTELSAT earth station\r\n\r\n@The Gambia, Defense Forces\r\n\r\nBranches:\r\n  Army, Navy, National Gendarmerie, National Police\r\nManpower availability:\r\n  males age 15-49 207,754; fit for military service 105,100\r\nDefense expenditures:\r\n  $NA, NA% of GDP\r\n\r\n\r\n@Gaza Strip\r\n\r\nHeader\r\nNote:\r\n  The war between Israel and Egypt, Syria, and Jordan in June 1967 ended\r\n  with Israel in control of the West Bank, East Jerusalem, the Gaza\r\n  Strip, the Sinai Peninsula, and the Golan Heights.

The construction, agricultural, and industrial sectors account\r\n  for about 18%, 16%, and 12% of GNP, respectively. Gaza depends upon\r\n  Israel for nearly 90% of its external trade. Aggravating the impact of\r\n  Israeli military administration, unrest in the territory since 1988\r\n  (intifadah) has raised unemployment and lowered the standard of living\r\n  of Gazans. The Persian Gulf crisis and its aftershocks also have dealt\r\n  blows to Gaza since August 1990. Worker remittances from the Gulf\r\n  states have dropped, unemployment has increased, and exports have\r\n  fallen. The withdrawal of Israel from the Gaza Strip in May 1994\r\n  brings a new set of adjustment problems.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GNP - exchange rate conversion - $840 million (1991 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  1% (1991 est.)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $1,275 (1991 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  7% (1991 est.)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  20% (1991 est.)\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues:\r\n  $33.6 million\r\nexpenditures:\r\n  $34.5 million, including capital expenditures of $NA (FY90)\r\nExports:\r\n  $75 million (f.o.b., 1991 est.)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  citrus\r\npartners:\r\n  Israel, Egypt\r\nImports:\r\n  $370 million (c.i.f., 1991 est.)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  food, consumer goods, construction materials\r\npartners:\r\n  Israel, Egypt\r\nExternal debt:\r\n  $NA\r\nIndustrial production:\r\n  growth rate 11% (1991 est.);

The country imports the bulk of\r\n  its energy needs, including natural gas and coal. Its only sizable\r\n  domestic energy resource is hydropower. Since 1990, widespread\r\n  conflicts, e.g., in Abkhazia, South Ossetia, and Mengrelia, severely\r\n  aggravated the economic crisis resulting from the disintegration of\r\n  the Soviet command economy in December 1991. Throughout 1993, much of\r\n  industry was functioning at only 20% of capacity; heavy disruptions in\r\n  agricultural cultivation were reported; and tourism was shut down. The\r\n  country is precariously dependent on US and EU humanitarian grain\r\n  shipments, as most other foods are priced beyond reach of the average\r\n  citizen. Georgia is also suffering from an acute energy crisis, as it\r\n  is having problems paying for even minimal imports. Georgia is pinning\r\n  its hopes for recovery on reestablishing trade ties with Russia and on\r\n  developing international transportation through the key Black Sea\r\n  ports of P'ot'i and Bat'umi.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $7.8 billion (1993 estimate from\r\n  the UN International Comparison Program, as extended to 1991 and\r\n  published in the World Bank's World Development Report 1993;

The Federal Republic,\r\n  however, continues to experience difficulties in integrating and\r\n  modernizing eastern Germany, and the tremendous costs of unification\r\n  pushed western Germany into its deepest recession since World War II.\r\n  The western German economy shrank by 1.9% in 1993 as the Bundesbank\r\n  maintained high interest rates to offset the inflationary effects of\r\n  large government deficits and high wage settlements. Eastern Germany\r\n  grew by 7.1% in 1993 but this was from a shrunken base. Despite\r\n  government transfers to the east amounting to nearly $110 billion\r\n  annually, a self-sustaining economy in the region is still some years\r\n  away. The bright spots are eastern Germany's construction,\r\n  transportation, telecommunications, and service sectors, which have\r\n  experienced strong growth. Western Germany has an advanced market\r\n  economy and is a world leader in exports. It has a highly urbanized\r\n  and skilled population that enjoys excellent living standards,\r\n  abundant leisure time, and comprehensive social welfare benefits.\r\n  Western Germany is relatively poor in natural resources, coal being\r\n  the most important mineral. Western Germany's world-class companies\r\n  manufacture technologically advanced goods. The region's economy is\r\n  mature: services and manufacturing account for the dominant share of\r\n  economic activity, and raw materials and semimanufactured goods\r\n  constitute a large portion of imports. In recent years, manufacturing\r\n  has accounted for about 31% of GDP, with other sectors contributing\r\n  lesser amounts. Gross fixed investment in 1993 accounted for about\r\n  20.5% of GDP. GDP in the western region is now $19,400 per capita, or\r\n  78% of US per capita GDP. Eastern Germany's economy appears to be\r\n  changing from one anchored on manufacturing into a more\r\n  service-oriented economy. The German government, however, is intent on\r\n  maintaining a manufacturing base in the east and is considering a\r\n  policy for subsidizing industrial cores in the region. Eastern\r\n  Germany's share of all-German GDP is only 8% and eastern productivity\r\n  is just 30% that of the west even though eastern wages are at roughly\r\n  70% of western levels. The privatization agency for eastern Germany,\r\n  Treuhand, has privatized more than 90% of the 13,000 firms under its\r\n  control and will likely wind down operations in 1994. Private\r\n  investment in the region continues to be lackluster, resulting\r\n  primarily from the deepening recession in western Germany and\r\n  excessively high eastern wages. Eastern Germany has one of the world's\r\n  largest reserves of low-grade lignite coal but little else in the way\r\n  of mineral resources. The quality of statistics from eastern Germany\r\n  is improving, yet many gaps remain; the federal government began\r\n  producing all-German data for select economic statistics at the start\r\n  of 1992. The most challenging economic problem is promoting eastern\r\n  Germany's economic reconstruction - specifically, finding the right\r\n  mix of fiscal, monetary, regulatory, and tax policies that will spur\r\n  investment in eastern Germany - without destabilizing western\r\n  Germany's economy or damaging relations with West European partners.\r\n  The government hopes a \"solidarity pact\" among labor unions, business,\r\n  state governments, and the SPD opposition will provide the right mix\r\n  of wage restraints, investment incentives, and spending cuts to\r\n  stimulate eastern recovery. Finally, the homogeneity of the German\r\n  economic culture has been changed by the admission of large numbers of\r\n  immigrants.\r\nNational product:\r\nGermany:\r\n  GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $1.331 trillion (1993)\r\nwestern:\r\n  GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $1.218 trillion (1993)\r\neastern:\r\n  GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $112.7 billion (1993)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\nGermany:\r\n  -1.2% (1993)\r\nwestern:\r\n  -1.9% (1993)\r\neastern:\r\n  7.1% (1993)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\nGermany:\r\n  $16,500 (1993)\r\nwestern:\r\n  $19,400 (1993)\r\neastern:\r\n  $6,300 (1993)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\nwestern:\r\n  4.2% (1993)\r\neastern:\r\n  8.9% (1993 est.)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\nwestern:\r\n  8.1% (December 1993)\r\neastern:\r\n  15.4% (December 1993)\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues:\r\n  $918 billion\r\nexpenditures:\r\n  $972 billion, including capital expenditures of $NA (1992)\r\nExports:\r\n  $392 billion (f.o.b., 1993)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  manufactures 89.0% (including machines and machine tools, chemicals,\r\n  motor vehicles, iron and steel products), agricultural products 5.4%,\r\n  raw materials 2.2%, fuels 1.3% (1922)\r\npartners:\r\n  EC 51.3% (France 11.1%, Netherlands 8.3%, Italy 8.2%, UK 7.9%,\r\n  Belgium-Luxembourg 7.5%), EFTA 13.3%, US 6.8%, Eastern Europe 5.0%,\r\n  OPEC 3.3% (1993)\r\nImports:\r\n  $374.6 billion (f.o.b., 1993)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  manufactures 74.9%, agricultural products 10.3%, fuels 7.4%, raw\r\n  materials 5.5% (1992)\r\npartners:\r\n  EC 49.7 (France 11.0%, Netherlands 9.2%, Italy 8.8%, UK 6.6%,\r\n  Belgium-Luxembourg 6.7%), EFTA 12.7%, US 5.9%, Japan 5.2%, Eastern\r\n  Europe 4.8%, OPEC 2.6% (1993)\r\nExternal debt:\r\n  $NA\r\nIndustrial production:\r\nwestern:\r\n  growth rate -7% (1993)\r\neastern:\r\n  growth rate $NA\r\nElectricity:\r\ncapacity:\r\n  134,000,000 kW\r\nproduction:\r\n  580 billion kWh\r\nconsumption per capita:\r\n  7,160 kWh (1992)\r\nIndustries:\r\nwestern:\r\n  among world's largest producers of iron, steel, coal, cement,\r\n  chemicals, machinery, vehicles, machine tools, electronics;

The agriculture sector consists largely of small traditional\r\n  farm holdings, rain-fed for the most part. Heavily dependent on cocoa,\r\n  gold, and timber exports, economic growth so far has not spread\r\n  substantially to other areas of the economy. The costs of sending\r\n  peacekeeping forces to Liberia and preparing for the transition to a\r\n  democratic government have boosted government expenditures and\r\n  undercut structural adjustment reforms.

Since\r\n  then, the public sector has been reduced to about 60% of GDP. Tourism\r\n  continues as a major source of foreign exchange, and agriculture is\r\n  self-sufficient except for meat, dairy products, and animal\r\n  feedstuffs. Over the last decade, real GDP growth has averaged 1.6% a\r\n  year, compared with the European Union average of 2.2%. Inflation is\r\n  four times the EU average, and the national debt has reached 140% of\r\n  GDP, the highest in the EU. Prime Minister PAPANDREOU will probably\r\n  only make limited progress correcting the economy's problems of high\r\n  inflation, large budget deficit, and decaying infrastructure. His\r\n  economic program suggests that although he will shun his expansionary\r\n  policies of the 1980s, he will avoid tough measures needed to slow\r\n  inflation or reduce the state's role in the economy. He has limited\r\n  the previous government's privatization plans, for example, and has\r\n  called for generous welfare spending and real wage increases. In 1994,\r\n  the GDP growth rate is likely to remain low, and inflation probably\r\n  will accelerate, remaining the highest in the EU. PAPANDREOU'S failure\r\n  to improve the country's economic performance will further strain\r\n  relations with the EU.

Unemployment\r\n  is increasing, and prospects for economic growth in the immediate\r\n  future are dim. Following the closing of the Black Angel lead and zinc\r\n  mine in 1989, Greenland became almost completely dependent on fishing\r\n  and fish processing, the sector accounting for 95% of exports.\r\n  Prospects for fisheries are not bright, as the important shrimp\r\n  catches will at best stabilize and cod catches have dropped.\r\n  Resumption of mining and hydrocarbon activities is not around the\r\n  corner, thus leaving only tourism with some potential for the near\r\n  future. The public sector in Greenland, i.e., the central government\r\n  and its commercial entities and the municipalities, plays a dominant\r\n  role in Greenland accounting for about two-thirds of total employment.\r\n  About half the government's revenues come from grants from the Danish\r\n  Government.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GNP - purchasing power equivalent - $500 million (1988)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  -10% (1990)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $9,000 (1988)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  1.6% (1991)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  9% (1990 est.)\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues:\r\n  $381 million\r\nexpenditures:\r\n  $381 million, including capital expenditures of $36 million (1989)\r\nExports:\r\n  $340.6 million (f.o.b., 1991)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  fish and fish products 95%\r\npartners:\r\n  Denmark 79%, Benelux 9%, Germany 5%\r\nImports:\r\n  $403 million (c.i.f., 1991)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  manufactured goods 28%, machinery and transport equipment 24%, food\r\n  and live animals 12.4%, petroleum products 12%\r\npartners:\r\n  Denmark 65%, Norway 8.8%, US 4.6%, Germany 3.8%, Japan 3.8%, Sweden\r\n  2.4%\r\nExternal debt:\r\n  $480 million (1990 est.)\r\nIndustrial production:\r\n  growth rate NA%\r\nElectricity:\r\ncapacity:\r\n  84,000 kW\r\nproduction:\r\n  176 million kWh\r\nconsumption per capita:\r\n  3,060 kWh (1992)\r\nIndustries:\r\n  fish processing (mainly shrimp), lead and zinc mining, handicrafts,\r\n  some small shipyards, potential for platinum and gold mining\r\nAgriculture:\r\n  sector dominated by fishing and sheep raising;

It is also dependent upon France for large subsidies and\r\n  imports. Tourism is a key industry, with most tourists from the US. In\r\n  addition, an increasingly large number of cruise ships visit the\r\n  islands. The traditionally important sugarcane crop is slowly being\r\n  replaced by other crops, such as bananas (which now supply about 50%\r\n  of export earnings), eggplant, and flowers. Other vegetables and root\r\n  crops are cultivated for local consumption, although Guadeloupe is\r\n  still dependent on imported food, which comes mainly from France.\r\n  Light industry consists mostly of sugar and rum production. Most\r\n  manufactured goods and fuel are imported.

Over the past 20 years the tourist industry has grown\r\n  rapidly, creating a construction boom for new hotels and the expansion\r\n  of older ones. Visitors numbered about 900,000 in 1992. The slowdown\r\n  in Japanese economic growth has been reflected in less vigorous growth\r\n  in the tourism sector. About 60% of the labor force works for the\r\n  private sector and the rest for government. Most food and industrial\r\n  goods are imported, with about 75% from the US. In early 1994, Guam\r\n  faces the problem of building up the civilian economic sector to\r\n  offset the impact of military downsizing.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GNP - purchasing power equivalent - $2 billion (1991 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  NA%\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $14,000 (1991 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  4% (1992 est.)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  2% (1992 est.)\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues:\r\n  $525 million\r\nexpenditures:\r\n  $395 million, including capital expenditures of $NA (1991)\r\nExports:\r\n  $34 million (f.o.b., 1984)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  mostly transshipments of refined petroleum products, construction\r\n  materials, fish, food and beverage products\r\npartners:\r\n  US 25%, Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands 63%, other 12%\r\nImports:\r\n  $493 million (c.i.f., 1984)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  petroleum and petroleum products, food, manufactured goods\r\npartners:\r\n  US 23%, Japan 19%, other 58%\r\nExternal debt:\r\n  $NA\r\nIndustrial production:\r\n  growth rate NA%\r\nElectricity:\r\ncapacity:\r\n  500,000 kW\r\nproduction:\r\n  2.3 billion kWh\r\nconsumption per capita:\r\n  16,300 kWh (1990)\r\nIndustries:\r\n  US military, tourism, construction, transshipment services, concrete\r\n  products, printing and publishing, food processing, textiles\r\nAgriculture:\r\n  relatively undeveloped with most food imported;

Guinea possesses over\r\n  25% of the world's bauxite reserves. The mining sector accounted for\r\n  85% of exports in 1991.

Few social assistance programs exist, and the lack\r\n  of employment opportunities remains one of the most critical problems\r\n  facing the economy, along with soil erosion and political instability.\r\n  Trade sanctions applied by the Organization of American States in\r\n  response to the September 1991 coup against President ARISTIDE have\r\n  further damaged the economy.

Productivity remains low. Industry, still in\r\n  its early stages, employs nearly 9% of the labor force, accounts for\r\n  15% of GDP, and generates 20% of exports. The service sectors,\r\n  including public administration, account for 50% of GDP and employ 20%\r\n  of the labor force. Basic problems facing the economy include rapid\r\n  population growth, high unemployment, a lack of basic services, a\r\n  large and inefficient public sector, and the dependence of the export\r\n  sector mostly on coffee and bananas, which are subject to sharp price\r\n  fluctuations. A far-reaching reform program initiated by former\r\n  President CALLEJAS in 1990 is beginning to take hold. In 1993 the\r\n  large fiscal deficit emerged as a key economic problem, the result of\r\n  improvident state spending.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $10 billion (1993 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  3.7% (1993 est.)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $1,950 (1993 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  13% (1993 est.)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  10%;

Real GDP\r\n  growth averaged a remarkable 8% in 1987-88, slowed to 3.0% in 1989-90,\r\n  and picked up to 4.2% in 1991, 5.0% in 1992, and 5.2% in 1993.\r\n  Unemployment, which has been declining since the mid-1980s, is now\r\n  about 2%.

Its economic reforms during the Communist era\r\n  gave it a head start on this process, particularly in terms of\r\n  attracting foreign investors - Hungary has accounted for about half of\r\n  all foreign direct investment in Eastern Europe since 1989.\r\n  Nonetheless, the economy continued to contract in 1993, with real GDP\r\n  falling perhaps 1%. Although the privatization process has lagged, in\r\n  December 1993 Hungary carried out the largest privatization yet in\r\n  Eastern Europe, selling a controlling interest in the Matav\r\n  telecommunications firm to private investors - including a 30% share\r\n  to a US-German consortium for $875 million. Overall, about half of GDP\r\n  now originates in the private sector. Unemployment rose to about 13%\r\n  in 1993 while inflation remained above 20%, and falling exports pushed\r\n  the trade deficit to about $3 billion. The government hopes that\r\n  economic recovery in Western Europe in 1994 will boost exports, lower\r\n  the trade deficit, and help jump-start the economy. The budget,\r\n  however, is likely to remain a serious concern; depressed tax revenue\r\n  pushed up the budget deficit in 1993.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $57 billion (1993 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  -1% (1993 est.)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $5,500 (1993 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  23% (1993 est.)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  13% (1993)\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues:\r\n  $10.2 billion\r\nexpenditures:\r\n  $12.5 billion, including capital expenditures of $NA (1993 est.)\r\nExports:\r\n  $8.9 billion (f.o.b., 1993 est.)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  raw materials, semi-finished goods, chemicals 39.6%, machinery 14.5%,\r\n  consumer goods 22.3%, food and agriculture 20.0%, fuels and energy\r\n  3.6% (January-June 1993)\r\npartners:\r\n  EC 49.8% (Germany 27.8%, Italy 9.5%), Austria 10.7%, the FSU 13.1%,\r\n  Eastern Europe 9.8% (1992)\r\nImports:\r\n  $12.5 billion (f.o.b., 1993 est.)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  fuels and energy 13.9%, raw materials, semi-finished goods, chemicals\r\n  35.9%, machinery 22.4%, consumer goods 21.8%, food and agriculture\r\n  6.0% (January-June 1993)\r\npartners:\r\n  EC 42.8% (Germany 23.6%, Italy 6.3%), Austria 14.4%, the FSU 16.8%,\r\n  Eastern Europe 9.2%\r\nExternal debt:\r\n  $24.7 billion (November 1993)\r\nIndustrial production:\r\n  growth rate 4% (1993 est.)\r\nElectricity:\r\ncapacity:\r\n  7,200,000 kW\r\nproduction:\r\n  30 billion kWh\r\nconsumption per capita:\r\n  3,000 kWh (1992)\r\nIndustries:\r\n  mining, metallurgy, construction materials, processed foods, textiles,\r\n  chemicals (especially pharmaceuticals), buses, automobiles\r\nAgriculture:\r\n  including forestry, accounts for 15% of GDP and 16% of employment;\r\n  highly diversified crop and livestock farming;

The economy is heavily\r\n  dependent on the fishing industry, which provides nearly 75% of export\r\n  earnings and employs 12% of the workforce. In the absence of other\r\n  natural resources - except energy - Iceland's economy is vulnerable to\r\n  changing world fish prices. Iceland's economy has been in recession\r\n  since 1988. The recession continued in 1993 due to a third year of\r\n  cutbacks in fishing quotas as well as falling world prices for the\r\n  country's main exports: fish and fish products, aluminum, and\r\n  ferrosilicon. Real GDP declined 3.3% in 1992 and rose slightly, by\r\n  0.4%, in 1993. The center-right government's economic goals include\r\n  reducing the budget and current account deficits, limiting foreign\r\n  borrowing, containing inflation, revising agricultural and fishing\r\n  policies, diversifying the economy, and privatizing state-owned\r\n  industries. The recession has led to a wave of bankruptcies and\r\n  mergers throughout the economy, as well as the highest unemployment of\r\n  the post-World War II period. Inflation, previously a serious problem,\r\n  declined from double digit rates in the 1980s to only 3.7% in 1992-93.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $4.2 billion (1993)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  0.4% (1993 est.)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $16,000 (1993)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  4% (1993)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  4.5% (1993 est.)\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues:\r\n  $1.8 billion\r\nexpenditures:\r\n  $1.9 billion, including capital expenditures of $191 million (1992)\r\nExports:\r\n  $1.5 billion (f.o.b., 1992)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  fish and fish products, animal products, aluminum, ferrosilicon,\r\n  diatomite\r\npartners:\r\n  EC 68% (UK 25%, FRG 12%), US 11%, Japan 8% (1992)\r\nImports:\r\n  $1.5 billion (c.i.f., 1992)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  machinery and transportation equipment, petroleum products,\r\n  foodstuffs, textiles\r\npartners:\r\n  EC 53% (Germany 14%, Denmark 10%, UK 9%), Norway 14%, US 9% (1992)\r\nExternal debt:\r\n  $3.9 billion (1992 est.)\r\nIndustrial production:\r\n  growth rate 1.75% (1991 est.)\r\nElectricity:\r\ncapacity:\r\n  1,063,000 kW\r\nproduction:\r\n  5.165 billion kWh\r\nconsumption per capita:\r\n  19,940 kWh (1992)\r\nIndustries:\r\n  fish processing, aluminum smelting, ferro-silicon production,\r\n  geothermal power\r\nAgriculture:\r\n  accounts for about 15% of GDP;

Faster economic growth in the 1980s\r\n  permitted a significant increase in real per capita private\r\n  consumption. A large share of the population, perhaps as much as 40%,\r\n  remains too poor to afford an adequate diet. Financial strains in 1990\r\n  and 1991 prompted government austerity measures that slowed industrial\r\n  growth but permitted India to meet its international payment\r\n  obligations without rescheduling its debt. Policy reforms since 1991\r\n  have extended earlier economic liberalization and greatly reduced\r\n  government controls on production, trade, and investment.

Indonesia has extensive natural wealth, yet, with\r\n  a large and rapidly increasing population, it remains a poor country.\r\n  Real GDP growth in 1985-93 averaged about 6%, quite impressive, but\r\n  not sufficient to both slash underemployment and absorb the 2.3\r\n  million workers annually entering the labor force. Agriculture,\r\n  including forestry and fishing, is an important sector, accounting for\r\n  21% of GDP and over 50% of the labor force. The staple crop is rice.\r\n  Once the world's largest rice importer, Indonesia is now nearly\r\n  self-sufficient. Plantation crops - rubber and palm oil - and textiles\r\n  and plywood are being encouraged for both export and job generation.\r\n  Industrial output now accounts for almost 40% of GDP and is based on a\r\n  supply of diverse natural resources, including crude oil, natural gas,\r\n  timber, metals, and coal. Foreign investment has also boosted\r\n  manufacturing output and exports in recent years. Indeed, the\r\n  economy's growth is highly dependent on the continuing expansion of\r\n  nonoil exports. Japan remains Indonesia's most important customer and\r\n  supplier of aid. Rapid growth in the money supply in 1989-90 prompted\r\n  Jakarta to implement a tight monetary policy in 1991, forcing the\r\n  private sector to go to foreign banks for investment financing. Real\r\n  interest rates remained above 10% and off-shore commercial debt grew.\r\n  The growth in off-shore debt prompted Jakarta to limit foreign\r\n  borrowing beginning in late 1991. Despite the continued problems in\r\n  moving toward a more open financial system and the persistence of a\r\n  fairly tight credit situation, GDP growth in 1992 and 1993 has matched\r\n  the government target of 6%-7% annual growth.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $571 billion (1993 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  6.5% (1993 est.)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $2,900 (1993 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  10% (1993 est.)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  3% official rate;

Over the past several years, the\r\n  government has introduced several measures to liberalize the economy\r\n  and reduce government intervention, but most of these changes have\r\n  moved slowly because of political opposition. Iran has faced\r\n  increasingly severe financial difficulties in 1992-93 due to an import\r\n  surge since 1989 and general financial mismanagement. At yearend 1993\r\n  the Iranian Government estimated that it owed foreign creditors about\r\n  $30 billion; an estimated $8 billion of this debt was in arrears.\r\n  Earnings from oil exports--which provide over 90% of Iran's export\r\n  revenues--are providing less relief to Iran than usual because of\r\n  declining oil prices.

The economy has been dominated by the oil sector, which\r\n  has traditionally provided about 95% of foreign exchange earnings. In\r\n  the 1980s, financial problems caused by massive expenditures in the\r\n  eight-year war with Iran and damage to oil export facilities by Iran,\r\n  led the government to implement austerity measures and to borrow\r\n  heavily and later reschedule foreign debt payments. After the end of\r\n  hostilities in 1988, oil exports gradually increased with the\r\n  construction of new pipelines and restoration of damaged facilities.\r\n  Agricultural development remained hampered by labor shortages,\r\n  salinization, and dislocations caused by previous land reform and\r\n  collectivization programs. The industrial sector, although accorded\r\n  high priority by the government, also was under financial constraints.\r\n  Iraq's seizure of Kuwait in August 1990, subsequent international\r\n  economic embargoes, and military action by an international coalition\r\n  beginning in January 1991 drastically changed the economic picture.\r\n  Industrial and transportation facilities suffered severe damage and\r\n  have been only partially restored. Oil exports remain at less than 10%\r\n  of the previous level. Shortages of spare parts continue. Living\r\n  standards deteriorated even further in 1993 and early 1994; consumer\r\n  prices at least tripled in 1993. The UN-sponsored economic embargo has\r\n  reduced exports and imports and has contributed to the sharp rise in\r\n  prices. The government's policies of supporting large military and\r\n  internal security forces and of allocating resources to key supporters\r\n  of the regime have exacerbated shortages.

Agriculture, once the most\r\n  important sector, is now dwarfed by industry, which accounts for 37%\r\n  of GDP, about 80% of exports, and employs 28% of the labor force.\r\n  Since 1987, real GDP growth, led by exports, has averaged 4% annually.\r\n  Over the same period, inflation has fallen sharply and chronic trade\r\n  deficits have been transformed into annual surpluses. Unemployment\r\n  remains a serious problem, however, and job creation is the main focus\r\n  of government policy. To ease unemployment, Dublin aggressively courts\r\n  foreign investors and recently created a new industrial development\r\n  agency to aid small indigenous firms. Government assistance is\r\n  constrained by Dublin's continuing deficit reduction measures.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $46.3 billion (1993)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  2.7% (1993)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $13,100 (1993)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  2.7% (1994 est.)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  16% (1994 est.)\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues:\r\n  $16 billion\r\nexpenditures:\r\n  $16.6 billion, including capital expenditures of $1.6 billion (1992\r\n  est.)\r\nExports:\r\n  $28.3 billion (f.o.b., 1992)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  chemicals, data processing equipment, industrial machinery, live\r\n  animals, animal products\r\npartners:\r\n  EC 75% (UK 32%, Germany 13%, France 10%), US 9%\r\nImports:\r\n  $23.3 billion (c.i.f., 1992)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  food, animal feed, data processing equipment, petroleum and petroleum\r\n  products, machinery, textiles, clothing\r\npartners:\r\n  EC 66% (UK 41%, Germany 8%, Netherlands 4%), US 15%\r\nExternal debt:\r\n  $17.6 billion (1992)\r\nIndustrial production:\r\n  growth rate 11.5% (1992); accounts for 37% of GDP\r\nElectricity:\r\ncapacity:\r\n  5,000,000 kW\r\nproduction:\r\n  14.5 billion kWh\r\nconsumption per capita:\r\n  4,120 kWh (1992)\r\nIndustries:\r\n  food products, brewing, textiles, clothing, chemicals,\r\n  pharmaceuticals, machinery, transportation equipment, glass and\r\n  crystal\r\nAgriculture:\r\n  accounts for 8% of GDP and 13% of the labor force; principal crops -\r\n  turnips, barley, potatoes, sugar beets, wheat; livestock - meat and\r\n  dairy products; 85% self-sufficient in food; food shortages include\r\n  bread grain, fruits, vegetables\r\nIllicit drugs:\r\n  transshipment point for hashish from North Africa to the UK and\r\n  Netherlands\r\nEconomic aid:\r\ndonor:\r\n  ODA commitments (1980-89), $90 million\r\nCurrency:\r\n  1 Irish pound (#Ir) = 100 pence\r\nExchange rates:\r\n  Irish pounds (#Ir) per US$1 - 0.6978 (January 1994), 0.6816 (1993),\r\n  0.5864 (1992), 0.6190 (1991), 0.6030 (1990), 0.7472 (1989)\r\nFiscal year:\r\n  calendar year\r\n\r\n@Ireland, Communications\r\n\r\nRailroads:\r\n  Irish National Railways (CIE) operates 1,947 km 1.602-meter gauge,\r\n  government owned; 485 km double track; 37 km electrified\r\nHighways:\r\ntotal:\r\n  92,294 km\r\npaved:\r\n  87,422 km\r\nunpaved:\r\n  gravel, crushed stone 4,872 km\r\nInland waterways:\r\n  limited for commercial traffic\r\nPipelines:\r\n  natural gas 225 km\r\nPorts:\r\n  Cork, Dublin, Waterford\r\nMerchant marine:\r\n  53 ships (1,000 GRT or over) totaling 139,278 GRT/173,325 DWT, bulk 4,\r\n  cargo 32, chemical tanker 2, container 4, oil tanker 3, refrigerated\r\n  cargo 2, short-sea passenger 3, specialized tanker 3\r\nAirports:\r\ntotal:\r\n  44\r\nusable:\r\n  42\r\nwith permanent-surface runways:\r\n  14\r\nwith runways over 3,659 m:\r\n  0\r\nwith runways 2,440-3,659 m:\r\n  2\r\nwith runways 1,220-2,439 m:\r\n  7\r\nTelecommunications:\r\n  modern system using cable and digital microwave circuits; 900,000\r\n  telephones; broadcast stations - 9 AM, 45 FM, 86 TV; 2 coaxial\r\n  submarine cables; 1 Atlantic Ocean INTELSAT earth station\r\n\r\n@Ireland, Defense Forces\r\n\r\nBranches:\r\n  Army (including Naval Service and Air Corps), National Police (Garda\r\n  Siochana)\r\nManpower availability:\r\n  males age 15-49 914,052; fit for military service 739,288; reach\r\n  military age (17) annually 33,809 (1994 est.)\r\nDefense expenditures:\r\n  exchange rate conversion - $500 million, 1.3% of GDP (1993)\r\n\r\n\r\n@Israel\r\n\r\nHeader\r\nAffiliation:\r\n  (also see separate Gaza Strip and West Bank entries)\r\nNote:\r\n  The territories occupied by Israel since the 1967 war are not included\r\n  in the data below.

Despite limited natural resources, Israel has\r\n  intensively developed its agricultural and industrial sectors over the\r\n  past 20 years. Industry employs about 22% of Israeli workers,\r\n  construction 6.5%, agriculture, forestry, and fishing 3.5%, and\r\n  services most of the rest. Diamonds, high-technology equipment, and\r\n  agricultural products (fruits and vegetables) are leading exports.\r\n  Israel usually posts current account deficits, which are covered by\r\n  large transfer payments from abroad and by foreign loans. Roughly half\r\n  of the government's external debt is owed to the United States, which\r\n  is its major source of economic and military aid. To earn needed\r\n  foreign exchange, Israel has been targeting high-technology niches in\r\n  international markets, such as medical scanning equipment. The influx\r\n  of Jewish immigrants from the former USSR, which topped 450,000 during\r\n  the period 1990-93, increased unemployment, intensified housing\r\n  problems, and strained the government budget. At the same time, the\r\n  immigrants bring to the economy valuable scientific and professional\r\n  expertise. Economic problems have eased as immigration has declined,\r\n  but activity has slowed as the economy shifts from housing to\r\n  export-driven growth.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $65.7 billion (1993 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  3.5% (1993 est.)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $13,350 (1993 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  11.3% (1993 est.)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  10.4% (1993 est.)\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues:\r\n  $33.4 billion\r\nexpenditures:\r\n  $36.3 billion, including capital expenditures of $9.4 billion (FY93)\r\nExports:\r\n  $14.1 billion (f.o.b., 1993 est.)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  machinery and equipment, cut diamonds, chemicals, textiles and\r\n  apparel, agricultural products, metals\r\npartners:\r\n  US, EC, Japan\r\nImports:\r\n  $20.3 billion (c.i.f., 1993 est.)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  military equipment, investment goods, rough diamonds, oil, other\r\n  productive inputs, consumer goods\r\npartners:\r\n  US, EC\r\nExternal debt:\r\n  $24.8 billion (December 1993 est.)\r\nIndustrial production:\r\n  growth rate 6.5% (1993 est.);

The country is\r\n  still divided into a developed industrial north, dominated by private\r\n  companies, and an undeveloped agricultural south, dominated by large\r\n  public enterprises. Services account for 48% of GDP, industry 35%,\r\n  agriculture 4%, and public administration 13%. Most raw materials\r\n  needed by industry and over 75% of energy requirements must be\r\n  imported. After growing at an annual average rate of 3% in 1983-90,\r\n  growth slowed to about 1% in 1991 and 1992 and fell by 0.7% in 1993.\r\n  In the second half of 1992, Rome became unsettled by the prospect of\r\n  not qualifying to participate in EC plans for economic and monetary\r\n  union later in the decade; thus it finally began to address its huge\r\n  fiscal imbalances. Thanks to the determination of Prime Ministers\r\n  AMATO and CIAMPI, the government adopted a fairly stringent budget for\r\n  1993 and 1994, abandoned its highly inflationary wage indexation\r\n  system, and started to scale back its extremely generous social\r\n  welfare programs, including pension and health care benefits. Monetary\r\n  officials were forced to withdraw the lira from the European monetary\r\n  system in September 1992 when it came under extreme pressure in\r\n  currency markets. For the 1990s, Italy faces the problems of\r\n  refurbishing a tottering communications system, curbing pollution in\r\n  major industrial centers, and adjusting to the new competitive forces\r\n  accompanying the ongoing economic integration of the European Union.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $967.6 billion (1993)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  -0.7% (1993)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $16,700 (1993)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  4.2% (1993)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  11.3% (January 1994)\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues:\r\n  $302 billion\r\nexpenditures:\r\n  $391 billion, including capital expenditures of $48 billion (1993\r\n  est.)\r\nExports:\r\n  $178.2 billion (f.o.b., 1992)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  metals, textiles and clothing, production machinery, motor vehicles,\r\n  transportation equipment, chemicals, other\r\npartners:\r\n  EC 58.3%, US 6.8%, OPEC 5.1% (1992)\r\nImports:\r\n  $188.5 billion (f.o.b., 1992)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  industrial machinery, chemicals, transport equipment, petroleum,\r\n  metals, food, agricultural products\r\npartners:\r\n  EC 58.8%, OPEC 6.1%, US 5.5% (1992)\r\nExternal debt:\r\n  $67 billion (1993 est.)\r\nIndustrial production:\r\n  growth rate -2.8% (1993 est.);

In September\r\n  1988, Hurricane Gilbert inflicted severe damage on crops and the\r\n  electric power system, a sharp but temporary setback to the economy.\r\n  By October 1989 the economic recovery from the hurricane was largely\r\n  complete, and real growth was up to about 3% for 1989. In 1991,\r\n  however, growth dropped to 0.2% as a result of the US recession, lower\r\n  world bauxite prices, and monetary instability. In 1992, growth was\r\n  1.2%, supported by a recovery in tourism and stabilization of the\r\n  Jamaican dollar in the second half of 1992.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $8 billion (1992 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  1.2% (1992 est.)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $3,200 (1992 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  30% (1992 est.)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  15.4% (1992)\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues:\r\n  $600 million\r\nexpenditures:\r\n  $736 million, including capital expenditures of $NA (FY91 est.)\r\nExports:\r\n  $1.1 billion (f.o.b., 1992)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  alumina, bauxite, sugar, bananas, rum\r\npartners:\r\n  US 40%, UK 14%, Germany 10%, Canada 10%, Norway 7%\r\nImports:\r\n  $1.5 billion (f.o.b., 1992)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  fuel, other raw materials, construction materials, food, transport\r\n  equipment, other machinery and equipment\r\npartners:\r\n  US 53%, UK 5%, Venezuela 6%, Germany 5%, Japan 4.0%\r\nExternal debt:\r\n  $4.5 billion (1992 est.)\r\nIndustrial production:\r\n  growth rate 2% (1990);

Industry, the most important sector of\r\n  the economy, is heavily dependent on imported raw materials and fuels.\r\n  Self-sufficient in rice, Japan must import about 50% of its\r\n  requirements of other grain and fodder crops. Japan maintains one of\r\n  the world's largest fishing fleets and accounts for nearly 15% of the\r\n  global catch. Overall economic growth has been spectacular: a 10%\r\n  average in the 1960s, a 5% average in the 1970s and 1980s. Economic\r\n  growth came to a halt in 1992-93 largely because of contractionary\r\n  domestic policies intended to wring speculative excesses from the\r\n  stock and real estate markets. At the same time, the stronger yen and\r\n  slower global growth are containing export growth. Unemployment and\r\n  inflation remain remarkably low in comparison with the other\r\n  industrialized nations. Japan continues to run a huge trade surplus -\r\n  $120 billion in 1993, up more than 10% from the year earlier - which\r\n  supports extensive investment in foreign assets. The new prime\r\n  minister HATA in early 1994 reiterated previous governments' vows of\r\n  administrative and economic reform, including reduction in the trade\r\n  surplus, but his weak coalition government faces strong resistance\r\n  from traditional interest groups. The crowding of the habitable land\r\n  area and the aging of the population are two major long-run problems.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $2.549 trillion (1993)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  0% (1993)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $20,400 (1993)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  1.3% (1993)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  2.5% (1993)\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues:\r\n  $490 billion\r\nexpenditures:\r\n  $579 billion, including capital expenditures (public works only) of\r\n  about $68 billion (FY93)\r\nExports:\r\n  $360.9 billion (f.o.b., 1993)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  manufactures 97% (including machinery 46%, motor vehicles 20%,\r\n  consumer electronics 10%)\r\npartners:\r\n  Southeast Asia 33%, US 29%, Western Europe 18%, China 5%\r\nImports:\r\n  $240.7 billion (c.i.f., 1993)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  manufactures 52%, fossil fuels 20%, foodstuffs and raw materials 28%\r\npartners:\r\n  Southeast Asia 25%, US 23%, Western Europe 15%, China 9%\r\nExternal debt:\r\n  $NA\r\nIndustrial production:\r\n  growth rate -4% (1993);

Potatoes, cauliflower, tomatoes, and especially flowers are\r\n  important export crops, shipped mostly to the UK. The Jersey breed of\r\n  dairy cattle is known worldwide and represents an important export\r\n  earner. Milk products go to the UK and other EU countries. In 1986 the\r\n  finance sector overtook tourism as the main contributor to GDP,\r\n  accounting for 40% of the island's output. In recent years the\r\n  government has encouraged light industry to locate in Jersey, with the\r\n  result that an electronics industry has developed alongside the\r\n  traditional manufacturing of knitwear. All raw material and energy\r\n  requirements are imported, as well as a large share of Jersey's food\r\n  needs.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP $NA\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  8% (1987 est.)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $NA\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  8% (1988 est.)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  NA%\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues:\r\n  $308 million\r\nexpenditures:\r\n  $284.4 million, including capital expenditures of $NA (1985)\r\nExports:\r\n  $NA\r\ncommodities:\r\n  light industrial and electrical goods, foodstuffs, textiles\r\npartners:\r\n  UK\r\nImports:\r\n  $NA\r\ncommodities:\r\n  machinery and transport equipment, manufactured goods, foodstuffs,\r\n  mineral fuels, chemicals\r\npartners:\r\n  UK\r\nExternal debt:\r\n  $NA\r\nIndustrial production:\r\n  growth rate NA%\r\nElectricity:\r\ncapacity:\r\n  50,000 kW standby\r\nproduction:\r\n  power supplied by France\r\nconsumption per capita:\r\n  NA (1992)\r\nIndustries:\r\n  tourism, banking and finance, dairy\r\nAgriculture:\r\n  potatoes, cauliflowers, tomatoes; dairy and cattle farming\r\nEconomic aid:\r\n  none\r\nCurrency:\r\n  1 Jersey pound (#J) = 100 pence\r\nExchange rates:\r\n  Jersey pounds (#J) per US$1 - 0.6699 (January 1994), 0.6658 (1993),\r\n  0.5664 (1992), 0.5652 (1991), 0.5603 (1990), 0.6099 (1989); the Jersey\r\n  pound is at par with the British pound\r\nFiscal year:\r\n  1 April - 31 March\r\n\r\n@Jersey, Communications\r\n\r\nHighways:\r\ntotal:\r\n  NA\r\npaved:\r\n  NA\r\nunpaved:\r\n  NA\r\nPorts:\r\n  Saint Helier, Gorey, Saint Aubin\r\nAirports:\r\ntotal:\r\n  1\r\nusable:\r\n  1\r\nwith permanent-surface runways:\r\n  1\r\nwith runways over 3,659 m:\r\n  0\r\nwith runways 2,440-3,659 m:\r\n  0\r\nwith runways 1,220-2,439 m:\r\n  1\r\nTelecommunications:\r\n  63,700 telephones; broadcast stations - 1 AM, no FM, 1 TV; 3 submarine\r\n  cables\r\n\r\n@Jersey, Defense Forces\r\n\r\nNote:\r\n  defense is the responsibility of the UK\r\n\r\n\r\n@Johnston Atoll\r\n\r\nHeader\r\n\r\nAffiliation:\r\n  (territory of the US)\r\n\r\n@Johnston Atoll, Geography\r\n\r\nLocation:\r\n  Oceania, Polynesia, in the North Pacific Ocean, 1,430 km\r\n  west-southwest of Honolulu, about one-third of the way between Hawaii\r\n  and the Marshall Islands\r\nMap references:\r\n  Oceania\r\nArea:\r\ntotal area:\r\n  2.8 sq km\r\nland area:\r\n  2.8 sq km\r\ncomparative area:\r\n  about 4.7 times the size of The Mall in Washington, DC\r\nLand boundaries:\r\n  0 km\r\nCoastline:\r\n  10 km\r\nMaritime claims:\r\ncontiguous zone:\r\n  24 nm\r\ncontinental shelf:\r\n  200-m depth or to depth of exploitation\r\nexclusive economic zone:\r\n  200 nm\r\nterritorial sea:\r\n  12 nm\r\nInternational disputes:\r\n  none\r\nClimate:\r\n  tropical, but generally dry; consistent northeast trade winds with\r\n  little seasonal temperature variation\r\nTerrain:\r\n  mostly flat with a maximum elevation of 4 meters\r\nNatural resources:\r\n  guano (deposits worked until about 1890)\r\nLand use:\r\narable land:\r\n  0%\r\npermanent crops:\r\n  0%\r\nmeadows and pastures:\r\n  0%\r\nforest and woodland:\r\n  0%\r\nother:\r\n  100%\r\nIrrigated land:\r\n  0 sq km\r\nEnvironment:\r\ncurrent issues:\r\n  NA\r\nnatural hazards:\r\n  NA\r\ninternational agreements:\r\n  NA\r\nNote:\r\n  strategic location in the North Pacific Ocean; Johnston Island and\r\n  Sand Island are natural islands; North Island (Akau) and East Island\r\n  (Hikina) are manmade islands formed from coral dredging; closed to the\r\n  public; former nuclear weapons test site; site of Johnston Atoll\r\n  Chemical Agent Disposal System (JACADS); some low-growing vegetation\r\n\r\n@Johnston Atoll, People\r\n\r\nPopulation:\r\n  327 (July 1994 est.)\r\n\r\n@Johnston Atoll, Government\r\n\r\nNames:\r\nconventional long form:\r\n  none\r\nconventional short form:\r\n  Johnston Atoll\r\nDigraph:\r\n  JQ\r\nType:\r\n  unincorportated territory of the US administered by the US Defense\r\n  Nuclear Agency (DNA) and managed cooperatively by DNA and the Fish and\r\n  Wildlife Service of the US Department of the Interior as part of the\r\n  National Wildlife Refuge system\r\nCapital:\r\n  none; administered from Washington, DC\r\nDiplomatic representation in US:\r\n  none (territory of the US)\r\nUS diplomatic representation:\r\n  none (territory of the US)\r\nFlag:\r\n  the flag of the US is used\r\n\r\n@Johnston Atoll, Economy\r\n\r\nOverview:\r\n  Economic activity is limited to providing services to US military\r\n  personnel and contractors located on the island.

In the remainder of the 1980s, however, reductions in\r\n  both Arab aid and worker remittances slowed real economic growth to an\r\n  average of roughly 2% per year. Imports - mainly oil, capital goods,\r\n  consumer durables, and food - outstripped exports, with the difference\r\n  covered by aid, remittances, and borrowing. In mid-1989, the Jordanian\r\n  Government began debt-rescheduling negotiations and agreed to\r\n  implement an IMF-supported program designed to gradually reduce the\r\n  budget deficit and implement badly needed structural reforms. The\r\n  Persian Gulf crisis that began in August 1990, however, aggravated\r\n  Jordan's already serious economic problems, forcing the government to\r\n  shelve the IMF program, stop most debt payments, and suspend\r\n  rescheduling negotiations. Aid from Gulf Arab states, worker\r\n  remittances and trade contracted, and refugees flooded the country,\r\n  producing serious balance-of-payments problems, stunting GDP growth,\r\n  and straining government resources. The economy rebounded in 1992,\r\n  largely due to the influx of capital repatriated by workers returning\r\n  from the Gulf, but the recovery has been losing steam since mid-1993.\r\n  The government is implementing the reform program adopted in 1992 and\r\n  continues to secure rescheduling of its heavy foreign debt.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $11.5 billion (1993 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  5% (1993 est.)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $3,000 (1993 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  5% (1993 est.)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  20% (1993 est.)\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues:\r\n  $1.7 billion\r\nexpenditures:\r\n  $1.9 billion, including capital expenditures of $420 million (1993)\r\nExports:\r\n  $1.4 billion (f.o.b., 1993 est.)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  phosphates, fertilizers, potash, agricultural products, manufactures\r\npartners:\r\n  India, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, EC, Indonesia, UAE\r\nImports:\r\n  $3.2 billion (c.i.f., 1993 est.)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  crude oil, machinery, transport equipment, food, live animals,\r\n  manufactured goods\r\npartners:\r\n  EC, US, Iraq, Japan, Turkey\r\nExternal debt:\r\n  $6.8 billion (December 1993 est.)\r\nIndustrial production:\r\n  growth rate 3% (1993 est.);

While the economy is gradually making the transition from a\r\n  Soviet command system to a market system, strong elements of state\r\n  control persist including government ownership of most economic assets\r\n  and a continued system of mandatory state procurement for the key\r\n  products such as grain and energy; likewise, agriculture remains\r\n  largely collectivized. On the other hand, new businesses are forming\r\n  rapidly, the economy is opening to foreign investment, and 12% of\r\n  state-owned commercial enterprises have been privatized. In 1993, a\r\n  three-year industrial privatization program was launched; an\r\n  independent currency was successfully introduced; and two large joint\r\n  ventures were established with western oil companies. These\r\n  far-reaching structural transformations have resulted in a cumulative\r\n  decline in national income of more than 30% since 1990. Loose monetary\r\n  policies have kept the inflation rate high, averaging 28% per month\r\n  for 1993 and accelerating at the end with the disruption caused by a\r\n  new currency. Since the introduction of its independent currency in\r\n  November 1993, the government has renewed its commitment to fiscal\r\n  discipline and accelerating economic reform. However, growing economic\r\n  hardship and rising ethnic tensions between Kazakhs and Russians over\r\n  the division of economic assets will likely lead to strong pressure to\r\n  backtrack.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $60.3 billion (1993 estimate from\r\n  the UN International Comparison Program, as extended to 1991 and\r\n  published in the World Bank's World Development Report 1993;

Commercially viable phosphate\r\n  deposits were exhausted at the time of independence in 1979. Copra and\r\n  fish now represent the bulk of production and exports. The economy has\r\n  fluctuated widely in recent years. Real GDP declined about 8% in 1987,\r\n  as the fish catch fell sharply to only one-fourth the level of 1986\r\n  and copra production was hampered by repeated rains. Output rebounded\r\n  strongly in 1988, with real GDP growing by 17%. The upturn in economic\r\n  growth came from an increase in copra production and a good fish\r\n  catch.

and state-owned industry produces 95% of\r\n  manufactured goods. State control of economic affairs is unusually\r\n  tight even for a Communist country because of the small size and\r\n  homogeneity of the society and the strict rule of KIM Il-song and his\r\n  son, KIM Chong-il. Economic growth during the period 1984-88 averaged\r\n  2%-3%, but output declined by 3%-5% annually during 1989-92 because of\r\n  systemic problems and disruptions in socialist-style economic\r\n  relations with the former USSR and China. In 1992, output dropped\r\n  sharply, by perhaps 7%-9%, as the economy felt the cumulative effect\r\n  of the reduction in outside support. The leadership insisted on\r\n  maintaining its high level of military outlays from a shrinking\r\n  economic pie. Moreover, a serious drawdown in inventories and critical\r\n  shortages in the energy sector have led to increasing interruptions in\r\n  industrial production. Abundant mineral resources and hydropower have\r\n  formed the basis of industrial development since WWII. Output of the\r\n  extractive industries includes coal, iron ore, magnesite, graphite,\r\n  copper, zinc, lead, and precious metals. Manufacturing is centered on\r\n  heavy industry, including military industry, with light industry\r\n  lagging far behind. Despite the use of improved seed varieties,\r\n  expansion of irrigation, and the heavy use of fertilizers, North Korea\r\n  has not yet become self-sufficient in food production. Six consecutive\r\n  years of poor harvests, coupled with distribution problems, have led\r\n  to chronic food shortages. North Korea remains far behind South Korea\r\n  in economic development and living standards.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $22 billion (1992 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  -7 to -9% (1992 est.)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $1,000 (1992 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  NA%\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  NA%\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues:\r\n  $19.3 billion\r\nexpenditures:\r\n  $19.3 billion, including capital expenditures of $NA (1992 est.)\r\nExports:\r\n  $1.3 billion (f.o.b., 1992 est.)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  minerals, metallurgical products, agricultural and fishery products,\r\n  manufactures (including armaments)\r\npartners:\r\n  China, Japan, Russia, South Korea, Germany, Hong Kong, Mexico\r\nImports:\r\n  $1.9 billion (f.o.b., 1992 est.)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  petroleum, grain, coking coal, machinery and equipment, consumer goods\r\npartners:\r\n  China, Russia, Japan, Hong Kong, Germany, Singapore\r\nExternal debt:\r\n  $8 billion (1992 est.)\r\nIndustrial production:\r\n  growth rate -7% to -9% (1992 est.)\r\nElectricity:\r\ncapacity:\r\n  7,300,000 kW\r\nproduction:\r\n  26 billion kWh\r\nconsumption per capita:\r\n  1,160 kWh (1992)\r\nIndustries:\r\n  machine building, military products, electric power, chemicals,\r\n  mining, metallurgy, textiles, food processing\r\nAgriculture:\r\n  accounts for about 25% of GNP and 36% of work force;

Real GNP increased more than 10% annually\r\n  between 1986 and 1991. This growth ultimately led to an overheated\r\n  situation characterized by a tight labor market, strong inflationary\r\n  pressures, and a rapidly rising current account deficit. As a result,\r\n  in 1992, economic policy focused on slowing the growth rate of\r\n  inflation and reducing the deficit. Annual growth slowed to 5%, still\r\n  above the rate in most other countries of the world. Growth increased\r\n  to 6.3% in 1993 as a result of fourth quarter manufacturing production\r\n  growth of over 10% and is expected to be in the 8% range for 1994.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GNP - purchasing power equivalent - $424 billion (1993 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  6.3% (1993)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $9,500 (1993 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  4.8% (1993)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  2.6% (October 1993)\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues:\r\n  $48.4 billion\r\nexpenditures:\r\n  $48.4 billion, including capital expenditures of $NA (1993 est.)\r\nExports:\r\n  $81 billion (f.o.b., 1993)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  electronic and electrical equipment, machinery, steel, automobiles,\r\n  ships, textiles, clothing, footwear, fish\r\npartners:\r\n  US 26%, Japan 17%, EC 14%\r\nImports:\r\n  $78.9 billion (c.i.f., 1993)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  machinery, electronics and electronic equipment, oil, steel, transport\r\n  equipment, textiles, organic chemicals, grains\r\npartners:\r\n  Japan 26%, US 24%, EC 15%\r\nExternal debt:\r\n  $42 billion (1992)\r\nIndustrial production:\r\n  growth rate 5% (1992 est.);

Its economy is heavily agricultural, producing cotton\r\n  and tobacco on irrigated land in the south, grain in the foothills of\r\n  the north, and sheep and goats on mountain pastures. Its small and\r\n  obsolescent industrial sector, concentrated around Bishkek, is heavily\r\n  dependent on Russia and other CIS countries for customers and for\r\n  inputs, including most of its fuel. Since 1990, the economy has\r\n  contracted by almost 40%. Kyrgyzstan's inflation was high in 1993,\r\n  about 23% per month, but rates were declining at the end of the year.\r\n  Kyrgyzstan introduced its national currency, the som, in May 1993, it\r\n  has privatized 28% of its former state assets, and plans call for a\r\n  massive voucher privatization in 1994. Although Kyrgyzstan will\r\n  receive relatively large flows of foreign aid, ongoing economic\r\n  restructuring will continue to be painful with an anticipated increase\r\n  in unemployment as uneconomic enterprises close. President AKAYEV will\r\n  be under strong political pressure to backtrack on some reform\r\n  measures.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $11.3 billion (1993 estimate from\r\n  the UN International Comparison Program, as extended to 1991 and\r\n  published in the World Bank's World Development Report 1993;

Since 1986,\r\n  however, the government has been decentralizing control and\r\n  encouraging private enterprise. Laos is a landlocked country with a\r\n  primitive infrastructure; it has no railroads, a rudimentary road\r\n  system, limited external and internal telecommunications, and\r\n  electricity available in only a limited area. Subsistence agriculture\r\n  is the main occupation, accounting for over 60% of GDP and providing\r\n  about 85-90% of total employment. The predominant crop is rice. For\r\n  the foreseeable future the economy will continue to depend for its\r\n  survival on foreign aid from the IMF and other international sources;\r\n  aid from the former USSR and Eastern Europe has been cut sharply.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $4.1 billion (1993 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  7% (1992 est.)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $900 (1993 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  9.8% (1992 est.)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  21% (1989 est.)\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues:\r\n  $83 million\r\nexpenditures:\r\n  $188.5 million, including capital expenditures of $94 million (1990\r\n  est.)\r\nExports:\r\n  $133 million (f.o.b., 1992 est.)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  electricity, wood products, coffee, tin\r\npartners:\r\n  Thailand, Malaysia, Vietnam, FSU, US, China\r\nImports:\r\n  $266 million (c.i.f., 1992 est.)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  food, fuel oil, consumer goods, manufactures\r\npartners:\r\n  Thailand, FSU, Japan, France, Vietnam, China\r\nExternal debt:\r\n  $1.1 billion (1990 est.)\r\nIndustrial production:\r\n  growth rate 12% (1991 est.);

The transition has been painful with GDP falling over\r\n  45% in 1992-93, according to official statistics, and industrial\r\n  production experiencing even steeper declines. Nevertheless, the\r\n  government's tough monetary policies and reform program, which foster\r\n  the development of the private sector and market mechanisms, have kept\r\n  inflation low, created a dynamic private sector - much of which is not\r\n  captured in official statistics - and expanded trade ties with the\r\n  West. Much of agriculture is already privatized and the government\r\n  plans to step up the pace of privatization of state enterprises. The\r\n  economy is now poised for recovery and will benefit from the country's\r\n  strategic location on the Baltic Sea, its well-educated population,\r\n  and its diverse - albeit largely obsolete - industrial structure.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $13.2 billion (1993 estimate from\r\n  the UN International Comparison Program, as extended to 1991 and\r\n  published in the World Bank's World Development Report 1993; and as\r\n  extrapolated to 1993 using official Latvian statistics, which are very\r\n  uncertain because of major economic changes since 1990)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  -5% (1993 est.)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $4,810 (1993 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  2% per month (1993 average)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  5.6% (December 1993)\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues:\r\n  $NA\r\nexpenditures:\r\n  $NA, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\nExports:\r\n  $429 million from non-FSU countries (f.o.b., 1992)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  oil products, timber, ferrous metals, dairy products, furniture,\r\n  textiles\r\npartners:\r\n  Russia, other CIS countries, Western Europe\r\nImports:\r\n  $NA\r\ncommodities:\r\n  fuels, cars, ferrous metals, chemicals\r\npartners:\r\n  Russia, other CIS countries, Western Europe\r\nExternal debt:\r\n  $NA\r\nIndustrial production:\r\n  growth rate -38% (1992 est.)\r\nElectricity:\r\ncapacity:\r\n  2,140,000 kW\r\nproduction:\r\n  5.8 billion kWh\r\nconsumption per capita:\r\n  2,125 kWh (1992)\r\nIndustries:\r\n  employs 41% of labor force; highly diversified; dependent on imports\r\n  for energy, raw materials, and intermediate products; produces buses,\r\n  vans, street and railroad cars, synthetic fibers, agricultural\r\n  machinery, fertilizers, washing machines, radios, electronics,\r\n  pharmaceuticals, processed foods, textiles\r\nAgriculture:\r\n  employs 16% of labor force; principally dairy farming and livestock\r\n  feeding; products - meat, milk, eggs, grain, sugar beets, potatoes,\r\n  vegetables; fishing and fish packing\r\nIllicit drugs:\r\n  transshipment point for illicit drugs from Central and Southwest Asia\r\n  and Latin America to Western Europe; limited producer of illicit\r\n  opium; mostly for domestic consumption; also produces illicit\r\n  amphetamines for export\r\nEconomic aid:\r\n  $NA\r\nCurrency:\r\n  1 lat = 100 cents; introduced NA March 1993\r\nExchange rates:\r\n  lats per US$1 - 0.5917 (January 1994), 1.32 (March 1993)\r\nFiscal year:\r\n  calendar year\r\n\r\n@Latvia, Communications\r\n\r\nRailroads:\r\n  2,400 km (1,524-mm gauge); 270 km electrified\r\nHighways:\r\ntotal:\r\n  59,500 km\r\npaved and graveled:\r\n  33,000 km\r\nunpaved:\r\n  earth 26,500 km (1990)\r\nInland waterways:\r\n  300 km perennially navigable\r\nPipelines:\r\n  crude oil 750 km; refined products 780 km; natural gas 560 km (1992)\r\nPorts:\r\n  coastal - Riga, Ventspils, Liepaja; inland - Daugavpils\r\nMerchant marine:\r\n  93 ships (1,000 GRT or over) totaling 850,840 GRT/1,107,403 DWT, cargo\r\n  15, container 2, oil tanker 41, refrigerated cargo 27,\r\n  roll-on/roll-off cargo 8\r\nAirports:\r\ntotal:\r\n  50\r\nusable:\r\n  15\r\nwith permanent-surface runways:\r\n  11\r\nwith runways over 3,659 m:\r\n  0\r\nwith runways 2,440-3,659 m:\r\n  7\r\nwith runways 1,060-2,439 m:\r\n  7\r\nnote:\r\n  a C-130 can land on a 1,060-m airstrip\r\nTelecommunications:\r\n  Latvia is better provided with telephone service than most of the\r\n  other former Soviet republics; subscriber circuits 660,000; subscriber\r\n  density 240 per 1,000 persons (1993); an NMT-450 analog cellular\r\n  telephone network covers 75% of Latvia's population; international\r\n  traffic carried by leased connection to the Moscow international\r\n  gateway switch and through the new Ericsson AXE local/transit digital\r\n  telephone exchange in Riga and through the Finnish cellular net;\r\n  electronic mail capability by Sprint data network; broadcasting\r\n  services NA\r\n\r\n@Latvia, Defense Forces\r\n\r\nBranches:\r\n  Ground Forces, Navy, Air Force, Security Forces (internal and border\r\n  troops), Border Guard,  Home Guard (Zemessardze)\r\nManpower availability:\r\n  males age 15-49 652,444; fit for military service 514,055; reach\r\n  military age (18) annually 18,803 (1994 est.)\r\nDefense expenditures:\r\n  176 million rubles, 3%-5% of GDP; note - conversion of the military\r\n  budget into US dollars using the prevailing exchange rate could\r\n  produce misleading results\r\n\r\n\r\n@Lebanon\r\n\r\nHeader\r\nNote:\r\n  Lebanon has made progress toward rebuilding its political institutions\r\n  and regaining its national sovereignty since the end of the\r\n  devastating 16-year civil war in October 1990. Under the Ta'if accord\r\n  - the blueprint for national reconciliation - the Lebanese have\r\n  established a more equitable political system, particularly by giving\r\n  Muslims a greater say in the political process. Since December 1990,\r\n  the Lebanese have formed three cabinets and conducted the first\r\n  legislative election in 20 years. Most of the militias have been\r\n  weakened or disbanded. The Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) has seized vast\r\n  quantities of weapons used by the militias during the war and extended\r\n  central government authority over about one-half of the country.\r\n  Hizballah, the radical Sh'ia party, retains most of its weapons.\r\n  Foreign forces still occupy areas of Lebanon. Israel maintains troops\r\n  in southern Lebanon and continues to support a proxy militia, The Army\r\n  of South Lebanon (ASL), along a narrow stretch of territory contiguous\r\n  to its border. The ASL's enclave encompasses this self-declared\r\n  security zone and about 20 kilometers north to the strategic town of\r\n  Jazzine. As of December 1993, Syria maintained about 30,000-35,000\r\n  troops in Lebanon. These troops are based mainly in Beirut, North\r\n  Lebanon, and the Bekaa Valley. Syria's deployment was legitimized by\r\n  the Arab League early in Lebanon's civil war and in the Ta'if accord.\r\n  Citing the continued weakness of the LAF, Beirut's requests, and\r\n  failure of the Lebanese Government to implement all of the\r\n  constitutional reforms in the Ta'if accord, Damascus has so far\r\n  refused to withdraw its troops from Beirut.\r\n\r\n@Lebanon, Geography\r\n\r\nLocation:\r\n  Middle East, in the eastern Mediterranean Sea, between Israel and\r\n  Syria\r\nMap references:\r\n  Africa, Middle East, Standard Time Zones of the World\r\nArea:\r\ntotal area:\r\n  10,400 sq km\r\nland area:\r\n  10,230 sq km\r\ncomparative area:\r\n  about 0.8 times the size of Connecticut\r\nLand boundaries:\r\n  total 454 km, Israel 79 km, Syria 375 km\r\nCoastline:\r\n  225 km\r\nMaritime claims:\r\nterritorial sea:\r\n  12 nm\r\nInternational disputes:\r\n  separated from Israel by the 1949 Armistice Line;

The\r\n  battered economy has also been propped up by a financially sound\r\n  banking system and resilient small- and medium-scale manufacturers.\r\n  Family remittances, banking transactions, manufactured and farm\r\n  exports, the narcotics trade, and international emergency aid are the\r\n  main sources of foreign exchange. In the relatively settled year of\r\n  1991, industrial production, agricultural output, and exports showed\r\n  substantial gains. The further rebuilding of the war-ravaged country\r\n  was delayed in 1992 because of an upturn in political wrangling. In\r\n  October 1992, Rafiq HARIRI was appointed Prime Minister. HARIRI, a\r\n  wealthy entrepreneur, has announced ambitious plans for Lebanon's\r\n  reconstruction which involve a substantial influx of foreign aid and\r\n  investment. Progress on restoring basic services is limited. Since\r\n  Prime Minister HARIRI's appointment, the most significant improvement\r\n  lies in the stabilization of the Lebanese pound, which had gained over\r\n  30% in value by yearend 1993.

Its economy is based on agriculture, light\r\n  manufacturing, and remittances from laborers employed in South Africa\r\n  (recently equal to about 45% of GDP). The great majority of households\r\n  gain their livelihoods from subsistence farming and migrant labor; a\r\n  large portion of the adult male workforce is employed in South African\r\n  mines. Manufacturing depends largely on farm products to support the\r\n  milling, canning, leather, and jute industries; other industries\r\n  include textile, clothing, and construction (in particular, a major\r\n  water improvement project which will permit the sale of water to South\r\n  Africa).

Businessmen have\r\n  fled the country, taking capital and expertise with them. Many will\r\n  not return. Richly endowed with water, mineral resources, forests, and\r\n  a climate favorable to agriculture, Liberia had been a producer and\r\n  exporter of basic products, while local manufacturing, mainly foreign\r\n  owned, had been small in scope. Political instability threatens\r\n  prospects for economic reconstruction and repatriation of some 750,000\r\n  Liberian refugees who have fled to neighboring countries. The\r\n  political impasse between the interim government and rebel leader\r\n  Charles Taylor has prevented restoration of normal economic life,\r\n  including the re-establishment of a strong central government with\r\n  effective economic development programs.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $2.3 billion (1993 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  1.5% (1988)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $800 (1993 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  12% (1989)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  43% urban (1988)\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues:\r\n  $242.1 million\r\nexpenditures:\r\n  $435.4 million, including capital expenditures of $29.5 million (1989\r\n  est.)\r\nExports:\r\n  $505 million (f.o.b., 1989 est.)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  iron ore 61%, rubber 20%, timber 11%, coffee\r\npartners:\r\n  US, EC, Netherlands\r\nImports:\r\n  $394 million (c.i.f., 1989 est.)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  rice, mineral fuels, chemicals, machinery, transportation equipment,\r\n  other foodstuffs\r\npartners:\r\n  US, EC, Japan, China, Netherlands, ECOWAS\r\nExternal debt:\r\n  $2.1 billion (September 1993 est.)\r\nIndustrial production:\r\n  growth rate NA% (1993-94);

In 1990 per capita GDP was the highest in\r\n  Africa at $5,410, but GDP growth rates have slowed and fluctuate\r\n  sharply in response to changes in the world oil market. Import\r\n  restrictions and inefficient resource allocations have led to\r\n  shortages of basic goods and foodstuffs. Windfall revenues from the\r\n  hike in world oil prices in late 1990 improved the foreign payments\r\n  position and resulted in a current account surplus through 1992. The\r\n  nonoil manufacturing and construction sectors, which account for about\r\n  20% of GDP, have expanded from processing mostly agricultural products\r\n  to include petrochemicals, iron, steel, and aluminum. Although\r\n  agriculture accounts for only 5% of GDP, it employs about 20% of the\r\n  labor force. Climatic conditions and poor soils severely limit farm\r\n  output, and Libya imports about 75% of its food requirements. The UN\r\n  sanctions imposed in April 1992 have not yet had a major impact on the\r\n  economy because Libya's oil revenues generate sufficient foreign\r\n  exchange that, along with Libya's large currency reserves, sustain\r\n  food and consumer goods imports as well as equipment for the oil\r\n  industry and ongoing development projects.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $32 billion (1993 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  1% (1993 est.)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $6,600 (1993 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  6% (1993 est.)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  NA%\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues:\r\n  $8.1 billion\r\nexpenditures:\r\n  $9.8 billion, including capital expenditures of $3.1 billion (1989\r\n  est.)\r\nExports:\r\n  $7.7 billion (f.o.b., 1993 est.)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  crude oil, refined petroleum products, natural gas\r\npartners:\r\n  Italy, Germany, Spain, France, UK, Turkey, Greece, Egypt\r\nImports:\r\n  $8.26 billion (f.o.b., 1993 est.)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  machinery, transport equipment, food, manufactured goods\r\npartners:\r\n  Italy, Germany, UK, France, Spain, Turkey, Tunisia, Eastern Europe\r\nExternal debt:\r\n  $3.5 billion excluding military debt (1991 est.)\r\nIndustrial production:\r\n  growth rate 10.5% (1990)\r\nElectricity:\r\ncapacity:\r\n  4,935,000 kW\r\nproduction:\r\n  14.385 billion kWh\r\nconsumption per capita:\r\n  2,952 kWh (1992)\r\nIndustries:\r\n  petroleum, food processing, textiles, handicrafts, cement\r\nAgriculture:\r\n  5% of GNP;

Over 40% of state property\r\n  has been privatized and trade is diversifying with a gradual shift\r\n  away from the former Soviet Union to Western markets. Nevertheless,\r\n  the process has been painful with industrial output in 1993 less than\r\n  half the 1991 level. Inflation, while lower than in most ex-Soviet\r\n  states, has exceeded rates in the other Baltic states. Full monetary\r\n  stability and economic recovery are likely to be impeded by periodic\r\n  government backtracking on key elements of its reform and\r\n  stabilization program as it seeks to ease the economic pain of\r\n  restructuring. Recovery will build on Lithuanian's strategic location\r\n  with its ice-free port at Klaipeda and its rail and highway hub in\r\n  Vilnius connecting it with Eastern Europe, Belarus, Russia, and\r\n  Ukraine, and on its agriculture potential, highly skilled labor force,\r\n  and diversified industrial sector. Lacking important natural\r\n  resources, it will remain dependent on imports of fuels and raw\r\n  materials.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $12.4 billion (1993 estimate from\r\n  the UN International Comparison Program, as extended to 1991 and\r\n  published in the World Bank's World Development Report 1993;

Agriculture is based on small\r\n  but highly productive family-owned farms. The industrial sector, until\r\n  recently dominated by steel, has become increasingly more diversified,\r\n  particularly toward high-technology firms. During the past decade,\r\n  growth in the financial sector has more than compensated for the\r\n  decline in steel.

Agriculture,\r\n  including fishing and forestry, is the mainstay of the economy,\r\n  accounting for over 30% of GDP and contributing more than 70% of total\r\n  export earnings. Industry is largely confined to the processing of\r\n  agricultural products and textile manufacturing; in 1991 it accounted\r\n  for only 13% of GDP. In 1986 the government introduced a five-year\r\n  development plan that stressed self-sufficiency in food (mainly rice)\r\n  by 1990, increased production for exports, and reduced energy imports.\r\n  Subsequently, growth in output has been held back because of\r\n  protracted antigovernment strikes and demonstrations for political\r\n  reform.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $10.4 billion (1993 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  1% (1992 est.)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $800 (1993 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  20% (1992 est.)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  NA%\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues:\r\n  $250 million\r\nexpenditures:\r\n  $265 million, including capital expenditures of $180 million (1991\r\n  est.)\r\nExports:\r\n  $312 million (f.o.b., 1991 est.)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  coffee 45%, vanilla 20%, cloves 11%, shellfish, sugar, petroleum\r\n  products\r\npartners:\r\n  France, Japan, Italy, Germany, US\r\nImports:\r\n  $350 million (f.o.b., 1992 est.)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  intermediate manufactures 30%, capital goods 28%, petroleum 15%,\r\n  consumer goods 14%, food 13%\r\npartners:\r\n  France, Germany, UK, other EC, US\r\nExternal debt:\r\n  $4.4 billion (1991)\r\nIndustrial production:\r\n  growth rate 5.2% (1990 est.);

During the 1980s\r\n  tourism became one of the most important and highest growth sectors of\r\n  the economy. In 1988 industry accounted for about 5% of GDP.

Malta produces only about 20% of its\r\n  food needs, has limited freshwater supplies, and has no domestic\r\n  energy sources. Consequently, the economy is highly dependent on\r\n  foreign trade and services. Manufacturing and tourism are the largest\r\n  contributors to the economy. Manufacturing accounts for about 27% of\r\n  GDP, with the electronics and textile industries major contributors\r\n  and the state-owned Malta drydocks which employs about 4,300 people.\r\n  In 1992, about 1,000,000 tourists visited the island. Per capita GDP\r\n  at $6,600 places Malta in the middle-income range of the world's\r\n  nations.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - exchange rate conversion - $2.4 billion (1992 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  4.5% (1992)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $6,600 (1992)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  1.64% (1992)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  4% (1992)\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues:\r\n  $1.2 billion\r\nexpenditures:\r\n  $1.2 billion, including capital expenditures of $182 million (FY94\r\n  est.)\r\nExports:\r\n  $1.3 billion (f.o.b., 1992)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  machinery and transport equipment, clothing and footware, printed\r\n  matter\r\npartners:\r\n  Italy 30%, Germany 22%, UK 11%\r\nImports:\r\n  $1.93 million (f.o.b., 1992)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  food, petroleum, machinery and semimanufactured goods\r\npartners:\r\n  Italy 30%, UK 16%, Germany 13%, US 4%\r\nExternal debt:\r\n  $118 million (1990)\r\nIndustrial production:\r\n  growth rate 5.4% (1992);

Agricultural\r\n  production is concentrated on small farms, and the most important\r\n  commercial crops are coconuts, tomatoes, melons, and breadfruit. A few\r\n  cattle ranches supply the domestic meat market. Small-scale industry\r\n  is limited to handicrafts, fish processing, and copra. The tourist\r\n  industry is the primary source of foreign exchange and employs about\r\n  10% of the labor force. The islands have few natural resources, and\r\n  imports far exceed exports.

Agriculture accounts for about 10% of GDP and the small\r\n  industrial sector for 10%. Sugar production has declined, with most of\r\n  the sugarcane now used for the production of rum. Banana exports are\r\n  increasing, going mostly to France. The bulk of meat, vegetable, and\r\n  grain requirements must be imported, contributing to a chronic trade\r\n  deficit that requires large annual transfers of aid from France.\r\n  Tourism has become more important than agricultural exports as a\r\n  source of foreign exchange. The majority of the work force is employed\r\n  in the service sector and in administration. Banana workers launched\r\n  protests late in 1992 because of falling banana prices and fears of\r\n  greater competition in the European market from other producers.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - exchange rate conversion - $3.3 billion (1991)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  NA%\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $9,500 (1991)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  3.9% (1990)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  32.1% (1990)\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues:\r\n  $268 million\r\nexpenditures:\r\n  $268 million, including capital expenditures of $NA (1989 est.)\r\nExports:\r\n  $201.5 million (f.o.b., 1991)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  refined petroleum products, bananas, rum, pineapples\r\npartners:\r\n  France 57.1%, Guadeloupe 31.5%, French Guiana 6.2%\r\nImports:\r\n  $1.5 billion (c.i.f., 1991)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  petroleum products, crude oil, foodstuffs, construction materials,\r\n  vehicles, clothing and other consumer goods\r\npartners:\r\n  France 62.2%, UK, Italy, Germany, Japan, US\r\nExternal debt:\r\n  $NA\r\nIndustrial production:\r\n  growth rate NA%\r\nElectricity:\r\ncapacity:\r\n  113,100 kW\r\nproduction:\r\n  588 million kWh\r\nconsumption per capita:\r\n  1,580 kWh (1992)\r\nIndustries:\r\n  construction, rum, cement, oil refining, sugar, tourism\r\nAgriculture:\r\n  including fishing and forestry, accounts for about 10% of GDP;\r\n  principal crops - pineapples, avocados, bananas, flowers, vegetables,\r\n  sugarcane for rum;

Mauritania has extensive deposits of iron ore,\r\n  which account for almost 50% of total exports. The decline in world\r\n  demand for this ore, however, has led to cutbacks in production. The\r\n  nation's coastal waters are among the richest fishing areas in the\r\n  world, but overexploitation by foreigners threatens this key source of\r\n  revenue. The country's first deepwater port opened near Nouakchott in\r\n  1986. In recent years, drought and economic mismanagement have\r\n  resulted in a substantial buildup of foreign debt. The government has\r\n  begun the second stage of an economic reform program in consultation\r\n  with the World Bank, the IMF, and major donor countries.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $2.2 billion (1992 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  3.3% (1993 est.)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $1,050 (1992 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  11.5% (1993 est.)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  20% (1991 est.)\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues:\r\n  $280 million\r\nexpenditures:\r\n  $346 million, including capital expenditures of $61 million (1989\r\n  est.)\r\nExports:\r\n  $432 million (f.o.b., 1992 est)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  iron ore, fish and fish products\r\npartners:\r\n  Japan 27%, Italy, Belgium, Luxembourg\r\nImports:\r\n  $413 million (c.i.f., 1992 est)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  foodstuffs, consumer goods, petroleum products, capital goods\r\npartners:\r\n  Algeria 15%, China 6%, US 3%, France, Germany, Spain, Italy\r\nExternal debt:\r\n  $1.9 billion (1992 est.)\r\nIndustrial production:\r\n  growth rate 4.4% (1988 est.);

During the 1980s, the accumulation of\r\n  large external debts, falling world petroleum prices, rapid population\r\n  growth, and mounting inflation and unemployment plagued the economy.\r\n  In recent years, the government has responded by implementing sweeping\r\n  economic reforms. Strict fiscal and monetary discipline have brought\r\n  inflation under control, reduced the internal debt, and produced\r\n  budgetary surpluses in 1992 and 1993. The tight money policies,\r\n  however, have restricted growth: barely 0.4% in 1993 after a rise of\r\n  2.6% in 1992 and 3.6% in 1991. Another aspect of the reform has been\r\n  the privatization of more than 80% of Mexico's businesses, including\r\n  all of the commercial banks. Seeking out increased trade and\r\n  investment opportunities, the government negotiated the North American\r\n  Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with the United States and Canada, which\r\n  entered into force on 1 January 1994. Within Latin America, Mexico has\r\n  completed bilateral free trade agreements with Chile and Costa Rica,\r\n  and is continuing negotiations with Colombia and Venezuela for a\r\n  trilateral deal in addition to holding trade discussions with various\r\n  other nations. In January of 1993, Mexico replaced its old peso at the\r\n  rate of 1,000 old to 1 new peso. Despite its hard-won economic\r\n  progress and the prospects of long-term gains under NAFTA, Mexico\r\n  still faces difficult problems, including sluggish growth,\r\n  unemployment, continuing social inequalities, serious pollution, and\r\n  the prospect of increased competition with the opening of trade.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $740 billion (1993 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  0.4% (1993)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $8,200 (1993 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  8% (1993 est.)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  10.7% (1992 est.)\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues:\r\n  $58.1 billion\r\nexpenditures:\r\n  $53 billion, including capital expenditures of $3.4 billion (1992\r\n  est.)\r\nExports:\r\n  $50.5 billion (f.o.b., 1993 est.), includes in-bond industries\r\ncommodities:\r\n  crude oil, oil products, coffee, silver, engines, motor vehicles,\r\n  cotton, consumer electronics\r\npartners:\r\n  US 74%, Japan 8%, EC 4% (1992 est.)\r\nImports:\r\n  $65.5 billion (f.o.b., 1993 est.), includes in-bond industries\r\ncommodities:\r\n  metal-working machines, steel mill products, agricultural machinery,\r\n  electrical equipment, car parts for assembly, repair parts for motor\r\n  vehicles, aircraft, and aircraft parts\r\npartners:\r\n  US 74%, Japan, 11%, EC 6% (1992)\r\nExternal debt:\r\n  $125 billion (1993 est.)\r\nIndustrial production:\r\n  growth rate 2.8% (1992 est.);

It introduced a\r\n  convertible currency - the leu - in late 1993 that has remained stable\r\n  against the dollar, removed price controls on most products,\r\n  eliminated licenses and quotas on most imports and exports, and freed\r\n  interest rates. In 1994, Moldova aims to privatize at least one-third\r\n  of state enterprises, lower inflation to 1% per month, and reduce the\r\n  budget deficit to 3.5% of GDP. Moldova enjoys a favorable climate and\r\n  good farmland but has no major mineral deposits. As a result,\r\n  Moldova's economy is primarily based on agriculture, featuring fruits,\r\n  vegetables, wine, and tobacco. Moldova, however, must import all of\r\n  its supplies of oil, coal, and natural gas, and energy shortages have\r\n  contributed to sharp production declines since the break-up of the\r\n  Soviet Union. Activities by separatist groups in the Dniester region\r\n  have held back economic development in that area.

The state has no\r\n  income tax and low business taxes and thrives as a tax haven both for\r\n  individuals who have established residence and for foreign companies\r\n  that have set up businesses and offices. About 50% of Monaco's annual\r\n  revenue comes from value-added taxes on hotels, banks, and the\r\n  industrial sector; about 25% of revenue comes from tourism.

Economic\r\n  activity traditionally has been based on agriculture and the breeding\r\n  of livestock - Mongolia has the highest number of livestock per person\r\n  in the world. In past years extensive mineral resources had been\r\n  developed with Soviet support; total Soviet assistance at its height\r\n  amounted to 30% of GDP. The mining and processing of coal, copper,\r\n  molybdenum, tin, tungsten, and gold account for a large part of\r\n  industrial production. Timber and fishing are also important sectors.\r\n  The Mongolian leadership is trying to make the transition from\r\n  Soviet-style central planning to a market economy through\r\n  privatization and price reform, and is soliciting support from\r\n  international financial agencies and foreign investors. The economy,\r\n  however, has still not recovered from the loss of Soviet aid, and the\r\n  country continues to suffer substantial economic hardships.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $2.8 billion (1993 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  -1.3% (1993 est.)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $1,200 (1993 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  325% (1992 est.)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  15% (1991 est.)\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues:\r\n  $NA\r\nexpenditures:\r\n  $NA, including capital expenditures of $NA (1991 est.)\r\nnote:\r\n  deficit of $67 million\r\nExports:\r\n  $355 million (f.o.b., 1992 est.)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  copper, livestock, animal products, cashmere, wool, hides, fluorspar,\r\n  other nonferrous metals\r\npartners:\r\n  former CMEA countries 62%, China 17%, EC 8% (1992)\r\nImports:\r\n  $501 million (f.o.b., 1991 est.)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  machinery and equipment, fuels, food products, industrial consumer\r\n  goods, chemicals, building materials, sugar, tea\r\npartners:\r\n  USSR 75%, Austria 5%, China 5%\r\nExternal debt:\r\n  $16.8 billion (yearend 1990);

Since the early 1980s the government has pursued an economic\r\n  program toward these objectives with the support of the IMF, the World\r\n  Bank, and the Paris Club of creditors. The economy has substantial\r\n  assets to draw on: the world's largest phosphate reserves, diverse\r\n  agricultural and fishing resources, a sizable tourist industry, a\r\n  growing manufacturing sector, and large remittances from Moroccans\r\n  working abroad. However, a severe drought in 1992-93 has depressed\r\n  economic activity and held down experts. Real GDP contracted by 2.9%\r\n  in 1992, and growth for 1993 is estimated at only 2%. Despite these\r\n  setbacks, initiatives to relax capital controls, strengthen the\r\n  banking sector, and privatize state enterprises went forward in 1993.\r\n  Servicing the large debt, high unemployment, and vulnerability to\r\n  external economic forces remain long-term problems for Morocco.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $70.3 billion (1993 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  2% (1993 est.)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $2,500 (1993 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  4.5% (1993 est.)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  16% (1992 est.)\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues:\r\n  $7.5 billion\r\nexpenditures:\r\n  $7.7 billion, including capital expenditures of $1.9 billion (1992\r\n  est.)\r\nExports:\r\n  $5.7 billion (f.o.b., 1992)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  food and beverages 30%, semiprocessed goods 23%, consumer goods 21%,\r\n  phosphates 17%\r\npartners:\r\n  EC 64%, India 6%, Japan 4%, US 3%\r\nImports:\r\n  $8.4 billion (c.i.f., 1992)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  capital goods 24%, semiprocessed goods 22%, raw materials 16%, fuel\r\n  and lubricants 16%, food and beverages 13%, consumer goods 9%\r\npartners:\r\n  EC 63%, US 6%, Saudi Arabia 4%, FSU 4%, Japan 1%\r\nExternal debt:\r\n  $21.3 billion (1992)\r\nIndustrial production:\r\n  growth rate 0.1% (year NA);

Indeed, national output, consumption, and\r\n  investment declined throughout the first half of the 1980s because of\r\n  internal disorders, lack of government administrative control, and a\r\n  growing foreign debt. A sharp increase in foreign aid, attracted by an\r\n  economic reform policy, resulted in successive years of economic\r\n  growth in the late 1980s, but aid has declined steadily since 1989.\r\n  Agricultural output is at only 75% of its 1981 level, and grain has to\r\n  be imported. Industry operates at only 20-40% of capacity. The economy\r\n  depends heavily on foreign assistance to keep afloat.

Few other resources exist, so most necessities must\r\n  be imported, including fresh water from Australia.

Industrial\r\n  activity is limited, mainly involving the processing of agricultural\r\n  produce (jute, sugarcane, tobacco, and grain). Production of textiles\r\n  and carpets has expanded recently and accounted for 85% of foreign\r\n  exchange earnings in FY94. Apart from agricultural land and forests,\r\n  exploitable natural resources are mica, hydropower, and tourism.\r\n  Agricultural production in the late 1980s grew by about 5%, as\r\n  compared with annual population growth of 2.6%. More than 40% of the\r\n  population is undernourished. Since May 1991, the government has been\r\n  encouraging trade and foreign investment, e.g., by eliminating\r\n  business licenses and registration requirements in order to simplify\r\n  domestic and foreign investment. The government also has been cutting\r\n  public expenditures by reducing subsidies, privatizing state\r\n  industries, and laying off civil servants. Prospects for foreign trade\r\n  and investment in the 1990s remain poor, however, because of the small\r\n  size of the economy, its technological backwardness, its remoteness,\r\n  and susceptibility to natural disaster. Nepal experienced severe\r\n  flooding in August 1993 which caused at least $50 million in damage to\r\n  the country's infrastructure.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $20.5 billion (1993 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  2.9% (FY93)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $1,000 (1993 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  9% (September 1993)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  5%;

The government makes its presence felt, however, through\r\n  many regulations, permit requirements, and welfare programs affecting\r\n  most aspects of economic activity. The trade and financial services\r\n  sector contributes over 50% of GDP. Industrial activity provides about\r\n  25% of GDP and is led by the food-processing, oil-refining, and\r\n  metalworking industries. The highly mechanized agricultural sector\r\n  employs only 5% of the labor force, but provides large surpluses for\r\n  export and the domestic food-processing industry. Rising unemployment\r\n  and a sizable budget deficit are currently the most serious economic\r\n  problems.

The\r\n  government has hoped that dynamic growth would boost real incomes,\r\n  broaden and deepen the technological capabilities of the industrial\r\n  sector, reduce inflationary pressures, and permit the expansion of\r\n  welfare benefits.

Inflation rose again to an estimated 20% in 1993, although this\r\n  increase was due almost entirely to a large currency devaluation in\r\n  January. As of early 1994, the government was close to finalizing an\r\n  enhanced structural adjustment facility with the IMF, after the\r\n  previous standby facility expired in early 1993. Despite these\r\n  successes, achieving overall economic growth in an economy scarred by\r\n  misguided economic values and civil war during the 1980s has proved\r\n  elusive. Economic growth was flat in 1992 and slightly negative in\r\n  1993. Nicaragua's per capita foreign debt is one of the highest in the\r\n  world; nonetheless, as of late 1993, Nicaragua was current on its\r\n  post-1988 debt as well as on payments to the international financial\r\n  institutions. Definition of property rights remains a problem;\r\n  ownership disputes over large tracts of land, businesses, and homes\r\n  confiscated by the previous government have yet to be resolved.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - purchasing power equivalent  - $6.4 billion (1993 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  -0.5% (1993 est.)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $1,600 (1993 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  20% (1993 est.)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  13%;

Uranium revenues dropped\r\n  by almost 50% between 1983 and 1990. Terms of trade with Nigeria,\r\n  Niger's largest regional trade partner, have improved dramatically\r\n  since the 50% devaluation of the African franc in January 1994; this\r\n  devaluation boosted exports of livestock, peas, onions, and the\r\n  products of Niger's small cotton industry.

Government\r\n  expenditures regularly exceed revenues, with the shortfall made up by\r\n  grants from New Zealand - the grants are used to pay wages to public\r\n  employees. The agricultural sector consists mainly of subsistence\r\n  gardening, although some cash crops are grown for export. Industry\r\n  consists primarily of small factories to process passion fruit, lime\r\n  oil, honey, and coconut cream. The sale of postage stamps to foreign\r\n  collectors is an important source of revenue. The island in recent\r\n  years has suffered a serious loss of population because of migration\r\n  of Niueans to New Zealand.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GNP - exchange rate conversion - $2.1 million (1989 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  NA%\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $1,000 (1989 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  9.6% (1984)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  NA%\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues:\r\n  $5.5 million\r\nexpenditures:\r\n  $6.3 million, including capital expenditures of $NA (1985 est.)\r\nExports:\r\n  $175,274 (f.o.b., 1985)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  canned coconut cream, copra, honey, passion fruit products, pawpaw,\r\n  root crops, limes, footballs, stamps, handicrafts\r\npartners:\r\n  NZ 89%, Fiji, Cook Islands, Australia\r\nImports:\r\n  $3.8 million (c.i.f., 1985)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  food, live animals, manufactured goods, machinery, fuels, lubricants,\r\n  chemicals, drugs\r\npartners:\r\n  NZ 59%, Fiji 20%, Japan 13%, Western Samoa, Australia, US\r\nExternal debt:\r\n  $NA\r\nIndustrial production:\r\n  growth rate NA%\r\nElectricity:\r\ncapacity:\r\n  1,500 kW\r\nproduction:\r\n  3 million kWh\r\nconsumption per capita:\r\n  1,490 kWh (1990)\r\nIndustries:\r\n  tourist, handicrafts, coconut products\r\nAgriculture:\r\n  coconuts, passion fruit, honey, limes;

The government controls key\r\n  areas, such as the vital petroleum sector (through large-scale state\r\n  enterprises) and extensively subsidizes agriculture, fishing, and\r\n  areas with sparse resources. Norway also maintains an extensive\r\n  welfare system that helps propel public sector expenditures to\r\n  slightly more than 50% of the GDP and results in one of the highest\r\n  average tax burdens in the world (54%). A small country with a high\r\n  dependence on international trade, Norway is basically an exporter of\r\n  raw materials and semiprocessed goods, with an abundance of small- and\r\n  medium-sized firms, and is ranked among the major shipping nations.\r\n  The country is richly endowed with natural resources - petroleum,\r\n  hydropower, fish, forests, and minerals - and is highly dependent on\r\n  its oil sector to keep its economy afloat. Although one of the\r\n  government's main priorities is to reduce this dependency, this\r\n  situation is not likely to improve for years to come. The government\r\n  also hopes to reduce unemployment and strengthen and diversify the\r\n  economy through tax reform and a series of expansionary budgets. The\r\n  budget deficit is expected to hit a record 8% of GDP because of\r\n  welfare spending and bail-outs of the banking system. Unemployment\r\n  continues at record levels of over 10% - including those in job\r\n  programs - because of the weakness of the economy outside the oil\r\n  sector. Economic growth was only 1.6% in 1993, while inflation was a\r\n  moderate 2.3%. Oslo, a member of the European Free Trade Area, has\r\n  applied for membership in the European Union and continues to\r\n  deregulate and harmonize with EU regulations. Membership is expected\r\n  in early 1995.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $89.5 billion (1993)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  1.6% (1993)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $20,800 (1993)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  2.3% (1993 est.)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  5.5% (excluding people in job-training programs;

It provides\r\n  low-cost sea transportation between East and West, extensive fishing\r\n  grounds, offshore oil and gas fields, minerals, and sand and gravel\r\n  for the construction industry. In 1985 over half (54%) of the world's\r\n  fish catch came from the Pacific Ocean, which is the only ocean where\r\n  the fish catch has increased every year since 1978. Exploitation of\r\n  offshore oil and gas reserves is playing an ever-increasing role in\r\n  the energy supplies of Australia, NZ, China, US, and Peru. The high\r\n  cost of recovering offshore oil and gas, combined with the wide swings\r\n  in world prices for oil since 1985, has slowed but not stopped new\r\n  drillings.\r\nIndustries:\r\n  fishing, oil and gas production\r\n\r\n@Pacific Ocean, Communications\r\n\r\nPorts:\r\n  Bangkok (Thailand), Hong Kong, Los Angeles (US), Manila (Philippines),\r\n  Pusan (South Korea), San Francisco (US), Seattle (US), Shanghai\r\n  (China), Singapore, Sydney (Australia), Vladivostok (Russia),\r\n  Wellington (NZ), Yokohama (Japan)\r\nTelecommunications:\r\n  several submarine cables with network nodal points on Guam and Hawaii\r\n\r\n\r\n@Pakistan, Geography\r\n\r\nLocation:\r\n  Southern Asia, along the Arabian Sea, between India and Afghanistan\r\nMap references:\r\n  Asia, Standard Time Zones of the World\r\nArea:\r\ntotal area:\r\n  803,940 sq km\r\nland area:\r\n  778,720 sq km\r\ncomparative area:\r\n  slightly less than twice the size of California\r\nLand boundaries:\r\n  total 6,774 km, Afghanistan 2,430 km, China 523 km, India 2,912 km,\r\n  Iran 909 km\r\nCoastline:\r\n  1,046 km\r\nMaritime claims:\r\ncontiguous zone:\r\n  24 nm\r\ncontinental shelf:\r\n  200 nm or the edge of continental margin\r\nexclusive economic zone:\r\n  200 nm\r\nterritorial sea:\r\n  12 nm\r\nInternational disputes:\r\n  status of Kashmir with India;

In addition, the economy must support\r\n  a large military establishment. Rapid economic growth, averaging 5%-6%\r\n  over the past decade has helped Pakistan cope with these problems.\r\n  However, growth slumped to 3% in FY93 because of severe flooding,\r\n  which damaged the key export crop, cotton. Almost all agriculture and\r\n  small-scale industry is in private hands. In 1990, Pakistan embarked\r\n  on a sweeping economic liberalization program to boost foreign and\r\n  domestic private investment and lower foreign aid dependence. The\r\n  SHARIF government denationalized several state-owned firms and\r\n  attracted some foreign investment. Pakistan likely will have\r\n  difficulty raising living standards because of its rapidly expanding\r\n  population. At the current rate of growth, population would double in\r\n  25 years.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GNP - purchasing power equivalent - $239 billion (1993 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  3% (FY93 est.)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $1,900 (1993 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  12.7% (FY91)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  10% (FY91 est.)\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues:\r\n  $9.4 billion\r\nexpenditures:\r\n  $10.9 billion, including capital expenditures of $3.1 billion (1993\r\n  est.)\r\nExports:\r\n  $6.8 billion (f.o.b., FY92)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  cotton, textiles, clothing, rice, leather, carpets\r\npartners:\r\n  US, Japan, Hong Kong, Germany, UK\r\nImports:\r\n  $9.1 billion (f.o.b., FY92)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  petroleum, petroleum products, machinery, transportation equipment,\r\n  vegetable oils, animal fats, chemicals\r\npartners:\r\n  Japan, US, Germany, UK, Saudi Arabia\r\nExternal debt:\r\n  $24 billion (1993 est.)\r\nIndustrial production:\r\n  growth rate 7.3% (FY92);

Agriculture provides a subsistence\r\n  livelihood for 85% of the population. Mining of numerous deposits,\r\n  including copper and gold, accounts for about 60% of export earnings.\r\n  Budgetary support from Australia and development aid under World Bank\r\n  auspices have helped sustain the economy. Robust growth in 1991-92 was\r\n  led by the mining sector; the opening of a large new gold mine helped\r\n  the advance. The economy remained strong in 1993, primarily because of\r\n  continued growth in the mining and oil sectors.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $8.2 billion (1993 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  1.2% (1993 est.)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $2,000 (1993 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  4.5% (1992-93)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  NA%\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues:\r\n  $1.33 billion\r\nexpenditures:\r\n  $1.49 billion, including capital expenditures of $225 million (1993\r\n  est.)\r\nExports:\r\n  $1.3 billion (f.o.b., 1990)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  gold, copper ore, oil, logs, palm oil, coffee, cocoa, lobster\r\npartners:\r\n  Australia, Japan, South Korea, UK, US\r\nImports:\r\n  $1.6 billion (c.i.f., 1990)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  machinery and transport equipment, manufactured goods, food, fuels,\r\n  chemicals\r\npartners:\r\n  Australia, Japan, US, Singapore, New Zealand, UK\r\nExternal debt:\r\n  $2.2 billion (April 1991)\r\nIndustrial production:\r\n  growth rate 21% (1992);

Paraguay lacks substantial\r\n  mineral or petroleum resources but possesses a large hydropower\r\n  potential. Since 1981 economic performance has declined compared with\r\n  the boom period of 1976-81, when real GDP grew at an average annual\r\n  rate of nearly 11%. During the period 1982-86 real GDP fell in three\r\n  of five years, inflation jumped to an annual rate of 32%, and foreign\r\n  debt rose. Factors responsible for the erratic behavior of the economy\r\n  were the completion of the Itaipu hydroelectric dam, bad weather for\r\n  crops, and weak export prices for agricultural commodities. In 1987\r\n  the economy experienced a minor recovery because of improved weather\r\n  conditions and stronger international prices for key agricultural\r\n  exports. The recovery continued through 1990, on the strength of\r\n  bumper crops in 1988-89. In a major step to increase its economic\r\n  activity in the region, Paraguay in March 1991 joined the Southern\r\n  Cone Common Market (MERCOSUR), which includes Brazil, Argentina, and\r\n  Uruguay. In 1992, the government, through an unorthodox approach,\r\n  reduced external debt with both commercial and official creditors by\r\n  purchasing a sizable amount of the delinquent commercial debt in the\r\n  secondary market at a substantial discount. The government had paid\r\n  100% of remaining official debt arrears to the US, Germany, France,\r\n  and Spain. All commercial debt arrears have been rescheduled. For the\r\n  long run, the government must press forward with general,\r\n  market-oriented economic reforms. Growth of 3.5% in 1993 was spurred\r\n  by higher-than-expected agricultural output and rising international\r\n  commodity prices. Inflation picked up steam in fourth quarter 1993\r\n  because of rises in public sector salaries and utility rates.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - purchasing power equivalent  - $15.2 billion (1993 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  3.5% (1993 est.)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $3,000 (1993 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  20.4% (1993 )\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  11% (1993 est.)\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues:\r\n  $1.2 billion\r\nexpenditures:\r\n  $1.4 billion, including capital expenditures of $487 million (1992\r\n  est.)\r\nExports:\r\n  $728 million (f.o.b., 1993 est.)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  cotton, soybean, timber, vegetable oils, meat products, coffee, tung\r\n  oil\r\npartners:\r\n  EC 37%, Brazil 25%, Argentina 10%, Chile 6%, US 6%\r\nImports:\r\n  $1.38 billion (c.i.f., 1993 est.)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  capital goods, foodstuffs, consumer goods, raw materials, fuels\r\npartners:\r\n  Brazil 30%, EC 20%, US 18%, Argentina 8%, Japan 7%\r\nExternal debt:\r\n  $1.2 billion (1993 est.)\r\nIndustrial production:\r\n  growth rate 2.2% (1991 est.);

In the 1980s the economy suffered from\r\n  hyperinflation, declining per capita output, and mounting external\r\n  debt. Peru was shut off from IMF and World Bank support in the\r\n  mid-1980s because of its huge debt arrears. An austerity program\r\n  implemented shortly after the FUJIMORI government took office in July\r\n  1990 contributed to a third consecutive yearly contraction of economic\r\n  activity, but the slide halted late that year, and output rose 2.4% in\r\n  1991. After a burst of inflation as the austerity program eliminated\r\n  government price subsidies, monthly price increases eased to the\r\n  single-digit level and by December 1991 dropped to the lowest increase\r\n  since mid-1987. Lima obtained a financial rescue package from\r\n  multilateral lenders in September 1991, although it faced $14 billion\r\n  in arrears on its external debt. By working with the IMF and World\r\n  Bank on new financial conditions and arrangements, the government\r\n  succeeded in ending its arrears by March 1993. In 1992, GDP fell by\r\n  2.8%, in part because a warmer-than-usual El Nino current resulted in\r\n  a 30% drop in the fish catch.

The economy contracted sharply\r\n  in 1990 and 1991, but in 1992 real GDP grew 1% despite a severe\r\n  drought. Real GDP expanded about 4% in 1993, the highest rate in\r\n  Europe except for Albania. About half of GDP now comes from the\r\n  private sector even though privatization of the large state-owned\r\n  enterprises is proceeding slowly and most industry remains in state\r\n  hands. The pattern of industrial production is changing rapidly;\r\n  output of textiles and construction materials is well above 1990\r\n  levels, while output of basic metals remains depressed. Inflation,\r\n  which had exceeded 50% monthly in late 1989, was down to about 37% for\r\n  all of 1993, as the government held the budget deficit below 3% of\r\n  GDP. Unemployment has risen steadily, however, to about 16%. The trade\r\n  deficit is also a problem, in part due to recession in Western Europe,\r\n  Poland's main customer. The new government elected in September 1993\r\n  is politically to the left of its predecessor but is continuing the\r\n  reform process.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $180.4 billion (1993 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  4.1% (1993 est.)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $4,680 (1993 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  37% (1993)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  15.7% (December 1993)\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues:\r\n  $24.3 billion\r\nexpenditures:\r\n  $27.1 billion, including capital expenditures of $1.5 billion (1993\r\n  est.)\r\nExports:\r\n  $13.5 billion (f.o.b., 1993 est.)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  machinery 24%, metals 17%, chemicals 12%, fuels and power 11%, food\r\n  10% (1992)\r\npartners:\r\n  Germany 31.4%, Netherlands 6.0%, Italy 5.6%, Russia 5.5% (1992)\r\nImports:\r\n  $15.6 billion (f.o.b., 1993 est.)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  fuels and power 17%, machinery 36%, chemicals 17%, food 8% (1992)\r\npartners:\r\n  Germany 23.9%, Russia 8.5%, Italy 6.9%, UK 6.7% (1992)\r\nExternal debt:\r\n  $47 billion (1993);

Recession in the European Union, which accounts for\r\n  75% of Portugal's international trade, is the key factor in the\r\n  downturn. The government's long-run economic goal is the modernization\r\n  of Portuguese markets, industry, infrastructure, and workforce in\r\n  order to catch up with productivity and income levels of the more\r\n  advanced EU countries. Per capita income now equals only 55% of the EU\r\n  average. The government's medium-term economic objective is to be in\r\n  the first tier of EU countries eligible to join the economic and\r\n  monetary union (EMU) as early as 1997. Economic policy in 1993 focused\r\n  on reducing inflationary pressures by lowering the fiscal deficit,\r\n  maintaining a stable escudo, moderating wage increases, and\r\n  encouraging increased competition. Resumption of growth in the short\r\n  run depends on the revival of growth in Europe as a whole, not a\r\n  likely prospect in the immediate future.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $91.5 billion (1993)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  -0.4% (1993)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $8,700 (1993)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  7% (1993 est.)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  7% (1993 est.)\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues:\r\n  $27.3 billion\r\nexpenditures:\r\n  $33.2 billion, including capital expenditures of $4.5 billion (1991\r\n  est.)\r\nExports:\r\n  $17.5 billion (f.o.b., 1993 est.)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  cotton textiles, cork and paper products, canned fish, wine, timber\r\n  and timber products, resin, machinery, appliances\r\npartners:\r\n  EC 75.4%, other developed countries 12.4%, US 3.8% (1992)\r\nImports:\r\n  $28 billion (c.i.f., 1993 est.)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  machinery and transport equipment, agricultural products, chemicals,\r\n  petroleum, textiles\r\npartners:\r\n  EC 72%, other developed countries 10.9% less developed countries\r\n  12.9%, US 3.4%\r\nExternal debt:\r\n  $20 billion (1993 est.)\r\nIndustrial production:\r\n  growth rate 9.1% (1990); accounts for 40% of GDP\r\nElectricity:\r\ncapacity:\r\n  6,624,000 kW\r\nproduction:\r\n  26.4 billion kWh\r\nconsumption per capita:\r\n  2,520 kWh (1992)\r\nIndustries:\r\n  textiles and footwear; wood pulp, paper, and cork; metalworking; oil\r\n  refining; chemicals; fish canning; wine; tourism\r\nAgriculture:\r\n  accounts for 6.1% of GDP and 20% of labor force; small, inefficient\r\n  farms; imports more than half of food needs; major crops - grain,\r\n  potatoes, olives, grapes; livestock sector - sheep, cattle, goats,\r\n  poultry, meat, dairy products\r\nIllicit drugs:\r\n  increasingly important gateway country for Latin American cocaine\r\n  entering the European market; transshipment point for hashish from\r\n  North Africa to Europe\r\nEconomic aid:\r\nrecipient:\r\n  US commitments, including Ex-Im (FY70-89), $1.8 billion\r\n  Western (non-US) countries, ODA and OOF bilateral commitments\r\n  (1970-89), $1.2 billion\r\nCurrency:\r\n  1 Portuguese escudo (Esc) = 100 centavos\r\nExchange rates:\r\n  Portuguese escudos (Esc) per US$1 - 176.16 (January 1994), 160.80\r\n  (1993), 135.00 (1992), 144.48 (1991), 142.55 (1990), 157.46 (1989)\r\nFiscal year:\r\n  calendar year\r\n\r\n@Portugal, Communications\r\n\r\nRailroads:\r\n  3,625 km total; state-owned Portuguese Railroad Co.

Industry has surpassed agriculture as the primary sector of\r\n  economic activity and income. Encouraged by duty free access to the US\r\n  and by tax incentives, US firms have invested heavily in Puerto Rico\r\n  since the 1950s. US minimum wage laws apply. Important industries\r\n  include pharmaceuticals, electronics, textiles, petrochemicals, and\r\n  processed foods. Sugar production has lost out to dairy production and\r\n  other livestock products as the main source of income in the\r\n  agricultural sector. Tourism has traditionally been an important\r\n  source of income for the island, with estimated arrivals of nearly 3\r\n  million tourists in 1989.

Sugarcane has\r\n  been the primary crop for more than a century, and in some years it\r\n  accounts for 85% of exports. The government has been pushing the\r\n  development of a tourist industry to relieve high unemployment, which\r\n  recently amounted to one-third of the labor force. The gap in Reunion\r\n  between the well-off and the poor is extraordinary and accounts for\r\n  the persistent social tensions. The white and Indian communities are\r\n  substantially better off than other segments of the population, often\r\n  approaching European standards, whereas indigenous groups suffer the\r\n  poverty and unemployment typical of the poorer nations of the African\r\n  continent. The outbreak of severe rioting in February 1991 illustrates\r\n  the seriousness of socioeconomic tensions. The economic well-being of\r\n  Reunion depends heavily on continued financial assistance from France.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $2.5 billion (1993 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  NA%\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $3,900 (1993 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  1.3% (1988)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  35% (February 1991)\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues:\r\n  $358 million\r\nexpenditures:\r\n  $914 million, including capital expenditures of $NA (1986 est.)\r\nExports:\r\n  $166 million (f.o.b., 1988)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  sugar 75%, rum and molasses 4%, perfume essences 4%, lobster 3%,\r\n  vanilla and tea 1%\r\npartners:\r\n  France, Mauritius, Bahrain, South Africa, Italy\r\nImports:\r\n  $1.7 billion (c.i.f., 1988)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  manufactured goods, food, beverages, tobacco, machinery and\r\n  transportation equipment, raw materials, and petroleum products\r\npartners:\r\n  France, Mauritius, Bahrain, South Africa, Italy\r\nExternal debt:\r\n  $NA\r\nIndustrial production:\r\n  growth rate NA%;

Market oriented reforms have been introduced fitfully since the\r\n  downfall of CEAUSESCU in December 1989, with the result a growing\r\n  private sector, especially in services. The slow pace of structural\r\n  reform, however, has exacerbated Romania's high inflation rate and\r\n  eroded real wages. Agricultural production rebounded in 1993 from the\r\n  previous year's drought-reduced harvest; food supplies are adequate,\r\n  but expensive. Bucharest resisted pressure to devalue its currency\r\n  despite a $638 million trade deficit in the first half of 1993 and the\r\n  emergence of a black market for hard currency. Unable to support the\r\n  currency, the national bank, nonetheless, was forced to depreciate the\r\n  currency 65% over the course of the year. The return of winter\r\n  revealed that much of Romania's infrastructure had deteriorated over\r\n  the last four years due to reduced levels of public investment.\r\n  Residents of the capital reported frequent disruptions of heating and\r\n  water services.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $63.7 billion (1993 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  1% (1993)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $2,700 (1993 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  6% per month (March 1994)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  11% (March 1994)\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues:\r\n  $19 billion\r\nexpenditures:\r\n  $20 billion, including capital expenditures of $2.1 billion (1991\r\n  est.)\r\nExports:\r\n  $4 billion (f.o.b., 1993)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  metals and metal products 24%, mineral products 14%, textiles 10.7%,\r\n  electric machines and equipment 9.3%, transport materials 9.2% (1993)\r\npartners:\r\n  EC 36.1%, developing countries 27.4%, East and Central Europe 14.9%,\r\n  EFTA 5.1%, Russia 5%, Japan 1.4%, US 1.3% (1993)\r\nImports:\r\n  $5.4 billion (f.o.b., 1993)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  minerals 29%, machinery and equipment 17.2%, textiles 10%,\r\n  agricultural goods 9% (1993)\r\npartners:\r\n  EC 45.8%, East and Central Europe 8.6%, developing countries 22.6%,\r\n  Russia 11%, EFTA 6.2%, US 5.0%, Japan 0.8% (1993)\r\nExternal debt:\r\n  $4 billion (1993)\r\nIndustrial production:\r\n  growth rate -1% (1993 est.);

President YEL'TSIN's\r\n  government has made some progress toward a market economy by freeing\r\n  most prices, slashing defense spending, unifying foreign exchange\r\n  rates, and launching an ambitious privatization program. Yet much of\r\n  the old order persists and YEL'TSIN faces formidable opposition to\r\n  further measures such as the reduction of subsidies to old-line\r\n  industries. Output continues to fall although the mix is gradually\r\n  becoming more responsive to Russia's needs. According to Russian\r\n  official data, GDP declined by 12% in 1993 compared with 19% in 1992.\r\n  Industrial output in 1993 fell 16% with all major sectors taking a\r\n  hit. Agricultural production, meanwhile, was down 6%. The grain\r\n  harvest totalled 99 million tons - some 8 million tons less than in\r\n  1992. Unemployment climbed in 1993 but remained low by Western\r\n  standards. The official number of unemployed rose from 578,000 at the\r\n  beginning of 1993 to about 1 million - or roughly 1.4% of the work\r\n  force - by yearend. According to the Russian labor minister, the\r\n  actual number of unemployed probably was closer to 4 million.\r\n  Government fears of large-scale unemployment continued to hamper\r\n  industrial restructuring efforts. According to official statistics,\r\n  average real wages remained flat. Nonetheless, a substantial portion\r\n  of the population, particularly the elderly and people in remote\r\n  areas, finds its well-being steadily shrinking. The disparity in\r\n  incomes between the rich and poor continued to rise in 1993, primarily\r\n  reflecting the high earnings of enterprise managers and persons\r\n  employed in the emerging private sector. The government tried to\r\n  narrow the income gap by raising the wages of budget-funded workers -\r\n  mainly teachers and health care specialists. Official data may\r\n  overstate hardships, because many Russians supplement their income by\r\n  moonlighting or by bartering goods and services, activities that often\r\n  go unreported. Russia made good progress on privatization in 1993\r\n  despite active opposition from key cabinet members, hard-line\r\n  legislators, and antireform regional leaders. By yearend, for example,\r\n  roughly 35% of Russia's medium and large state enterprises had been\r\n  auctioned, while the number of private farms in Russia increased by\r\n  86,000, reaching a total of 170,000. As a result, about 6% of\r\n  agricultural land now has been privatized. Financial stabilization\r\n  continued to remain a challenge for the government. Moscow tightened\r\n  financial policies in early 1993 - including postponing planned budget\r\n  spending - and succeeded in reducing monthly inflation from 27% in\r\n  January to 20% in May and June. In the summer, however, the government\r\n  relaxed austerity measures in the face of mounting pressure from\r\n  industry and agriculture, sparking a new round of inflation; the\r\n  monthly inflation rate jumped to 25% in August. In response, Moscow\r\n  announced a package of measures designed to curb government spending\r\n  and inflation. It included eliminating bread subsidies, delaying\r\n  payment obligations, raising interest rates, and phasing out\r\n  concessionary Central Bank credits to enterprises and regions. The\r\n  measures met with some success; the monthly inflation rate declined to\r\n  13% in December. According to official statistics, Russia's 1993 trade\r\n  with nations outside the former Soviet Union produced a $16 billion\r\n  surplus, up from $6 billion in 1992. Moscow arrested the steep drop in\r\n  exports that it had been suffering as a result of ruptured ties with\r\n  former trading partners, output declines, and erratic efforts to move\r\n  to world prices. Foreign sales - comprised largely of oil, natural\r\n  gas, and other raw materials - grew slightly. Imports were down by 15%\r\n  or so as a result of new import taxes and Moscow's reluctance to\r\n  increase its debt burden by purchasing grain and other goods with\r\n  foreign credits. Russian trade with other former Soviet republics\r\n  continued to decline and yielded a surplus of some $5 billion. At the\r\n  same time, Russia paid only a fraction of the roughly $20 billion in\r\n  debt coming due in 1993, and by mid-year, Russia's foreign debt had\r\n  amounted to $81.5 billion. While Moscow reached agreement to\r\n  restructure debts with Paris Club official creditors in April 1993,\r\n  Moscow's refusal to waive its right to sovereign immunity kept Russia\r\n  and its bank creditors from agreeing to restructure Moscow's\r\n  commercial loans. Capital flight continued to be a serious problem in\r\n  1993, with billions of dollars in assets owned by Russians being\r\n  parked abroad at yearend. Russia's capital stock continues to\r\n  deteriorate because of insufficient maintenance and new construction.\r\n  The capital stock on average is twice the age of capital stock in the\r\n  West. Many years will pass before Russia can take full advantage of\r\n  its natural resources and its human assets.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $775.4 billion (1993 estimate from\r\n  the UN International Comparison Program, as extended to 1991 and\r\n  published in the World Bank's World Development Report 1993;

The amount of fertile land is\r\n  limited, however, and deforestation and soil erosion have created\r\n  problems. The industrial sector in Rwanda is small, contributing only\r\n  17% to GDP. Manufacturing focuses mainly on the processing of\r\n  agricultural products. The Rwandan economy remains dependent on\r\n  coffee/tea exports and foreign aid. Weak international prices since\r\n  1986 have caused the economy to contract and per capita GDP to\r\n  decline. A structural adjustment program with the World Bank began in\r\n  October 1990. Ethnic-based insurgency in 1990-93 devastated wide areas\r\n  of the north and displaced hundreds of thousands of people. A peace\r\n  accord in mid-1993 temporarily ended most of the fighting, but massive\r\n  resumption of civil warfare in April 1994 in the capital city Kigali\r\n  has been taking thousands of lives and severely damaging short-term\r\n  economic prospects\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $6.8 billion (1993 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  1.3% (1992 est.)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $800 (1993 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  9.5% (1992 est.)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  NA%\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues:\r\n  $350 million\r\nexpenditures:\r\n  $NA, including capital expenditures of $NA (1992 est.)\r\nExports:\r\n  $66.6 million (f.o.b., 1992 est.)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  coffee 63%, tea, cassiterite, wolframite, pyrethrum\r\npartners:\r\n  Germany, Belgium, Italy, Uganda, UK, France, US\r\nImports:\r\n  $259.5 million (f.o.b., 1992 est.)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  textiles, foodstuffs, machines and equipment, capital goods, steel,\r\n  petroleum products, cement and construction material\r\npartners:\r\n  US, Belgium, Germany, Kenya, Japan\r\nExternal debt:\r\n  $845 million (1991 est.)\r\nIndustrial production:\r\n  growth rate -2.2% (1991);

The economy\r\n  exhibited relatively strong growth in 1992-93 based on a recovery of\r\n  the agricultural and manufacturing sectors and continued growth in\r\n  construction and tourism.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - exchange rate conversion - $433 million (1993 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  6.6% (1992 est.)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $3,000 (1993 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  5.1% (1992)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  NA%\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues:\r\n  $121 million\r\nexpenditures:\r\n  $127 million, including capital expenditures of $104 million (1992\r\n  est.)\r\nExports:\r\n  $122.8 million (f.o.b., 1992)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  bananas 60%, clothing, cocoa, vegetables, fruits, coconut oil\r\npartners:\r\n  UK 56%, US 22%, CARICOM 19% (1991)\r\nImports:\r\n  $276 million (f.o.b., 1992)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  manufactured goods 21%, machinery and transportation equipment 21%,\r\n  food and live animals, chemicals, fuels\r\npartners:\r\n  US 34%, CARICOM 17%, UK 14%, Japan 7%, Canada 4% (1991)\r\nExternal debt:\r\n  $96.4 million (1992 est.)\r\nIndustrial production:\r\n  growth rate 3.5% (1990 est.);

The economy has been declining, however, because the\r\n  number of ships stopping at Saint Pierre has dropped steadily over the\r\n  years. In March 1989, an agreement between France and Canada set fish\r\n  quotas for Saint Pierre's trawlers fishing in Canadian and\r\n  Canadian-claimed waters for three years. The agreement settles a\r\n  longstanding dispute that had virtually brought fish exports to a\r\n  halt. The islands are heavily subsidized by France.

Since then, however, cocoa\r\n  production has gradually deteriorated because of drought and\r\n  mismanagement, so that by 1987 output had fallen to less than 50% of\r\n  its former levels. As a result, a shortage of cocoa for export has\r\n  created a serious balance-of-payments problem. Production of less\r\n  important crops, such as coffee, copra, and palm kernels, has also\r\n  declined. The value of imports generally exceeds that of exports by a\r\n  ratio of 4:1. The emphasis on cocoa production at the expense of other\r\n  food crops has meant that Sao Tome has to import 90% of food needs. It\r\n  also has to import all fuels and most manufactured goods. Over the\r\n  years, Sao Tome has been unable to service its external debt, which\r\n  amounts to roughly 80% of export earnings. Considerable potential\r\n  exists for development of a tourist industry, and the government has\r\n  taken steps to expand facilities in recent years. The government also\r\n  implemented a Five-Year Plan covering 1986-90 to restructure the\r\n  economy and reschedule external debt service payments in cooperation\r\n  with the International Development Association and Western lenders.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - exchange rate conversion - $50 million (1990)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  1.5% (1992 est.)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $450 (1990)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  27% (1992 est.)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  NA%\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues:\r\n  $10.2 million\r\nexpenditures:\r\n  $36.8 million, including capital expenditures of $22.5 million (1989\r\n  est.)\r\nExports:\r\n  $5.4 million (f.o.b., 1992 est.)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  cocoa 78%, copra, coffee, palm oil\r\npartners:\r\n  Netherlands, Germany, China, Portugal\r\nImports:\r\n  $31.5 million (f.o.b., 1992 est.)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  machinery and electrical equipment 44%, food products 18%, petroleum\r\n  11%\r\npartners:\r\n  Portugal, Japan, Spain, France, Angola\r\nExternal debt:\r\n  $163.6 million (1992)\r\nIndustrial production:\r\n  growth rate 1% (1991);

Saudi Arabia has the largest\r\n  reserves of petroleum in the world, ranks as the largest exporter of\r\n  petroleum, and plays a leading role in OPEC. For the 1990s the\r\n  government intends to bring its budget, which has been in deficit\r\n  since 1983, back into balance, and to encourage private economic\r\n  activity. Roughly four million foreign workers play an important role\r\n  in the Saudi economy, for example, in the oil and banking sectors. For\r\n  about a decade, Saudi Arabia's domestic and international outlays have\r\n  outstripped its income, and the government has cut its foreign\r\n  assistance and is beginning to rein in domestic programs.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $194 billion (1993 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  1% (1993 est.)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $11,000 (1993 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  1% (1993 est.)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  6.5% (1992 est.)\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues:\r\n  $39 billion\r\nexpenditures:\r\n  $50 billion, including capital expenditures of $7.5 billion (1993\r\n  est.)\r\nExports:\r\n  $42.3 billion (f.o.b., 1993 est.)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  petroleum and petroleum products 92%\r\npartners:\r\n  US 21%, Japan 18%, Singapore 6%, France 6%, Korea 5%\r\nImports:\r\n  $26 billion (f.o.b., 1993 est.)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  machinery and equipment, chemicals, foodstuffs, motor vehicles,\r\n  textiles\r\npartners:\r\n  US 18%, UK 12%, Japan 10%, Germany 5%, France 5%\r\nExternal debt:\r\n  $18.9 billion (December 1989 est., includes short-term trade credits)\r\nIndustrial production:\r\n  growth rate 20% (1991 est.);

Declining terms of trade, weather-related setbacks,\r\n  and relentless growth in population have held back overall growth and\r\n  left per capita incomes stagnant, if not diminished. The economy\r\n  continues to rely on exports of fish, peanuts, and phosphates for hard\r\n  currency earnings. A 50% devaluation of the African franc in January\r\n  1994 is likely to lead to substantial increases in local currency\r\n  prices for producers that may spur improved production. A sheltered\r\n  import-substitution sector, comprising textiles, shoes, and other\r\n  light manufacturing, will remain plagued, however, by high labor,\r\n  transportation, and energy costs.

Serbia and\r\n  Montenegro faces major economic problems; output has dropped sharply,\r\n  particularly in 1993. First, like the other former Yugoslav republics,\r\n  it depended on its sister republics for large amounts of foodstuffs,\r\n  energy supplies, and manufactures. Wide varieties in climate, mineral\r\n  resources, and levels of technology among the republics accentuate\r\n  this interdependence, as did the communist practice of concentrating\r\n  much industrial output in a small number of giant plants. The breakup\r\n  of many of the trade links, the sharp drop in output as industrial\r\n  plants lost suppliers and markets, and the destruction of physical\r\n  assets in the fighting all have contributed to the economic\r\n  difficulties of the republics. One singular factor in the economic\r\n  situation of Serbia and Montenegro is the continuation in office of a\r\n  communist government that is primarily interested in political and\r\n  military mastery, not economic reform. A further complication is the\r\n  imposition of economic sanctions by the UN.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - exchange rate conversion - $10 billion (1993 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  NA%\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $1,000 (1993 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  hyperinflation (1993)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  more than 60% (1993 est.)\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues:\r\n  $NA\r\nexpenditures:\r\n  $NA, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\nExports:\r\n  $4.4 billion (f.o.b., 1990)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  machinery and transport equipment 29%, manufactured goods 28.5%,\r\n  miscellaneous manufactured articles 13.5%, chemicals 11%, food and\r\n  live animals 9%, raw materials 6%, fuels and lubricants 2%, beverages\r\n  and tobacco 1%\r\npartners:\r\n  prior to the imposition of sanctions by the UN Security Council trade\r\n  partners were principally the other former Yugoslav republics;

Manufacturing, which accounts for roughly 10% of GDP,\r\n  consists mainly of the processing of raw materials and of light\r\n  manufacturing for the domestic market. Diamond mining provides an\r\n  important source of hard currency. In 1990-93, the government, with\r\n  the support of the IMF and the World Bank, has made substantial\r\n  progress toward structural reform and better fiscal management. The\r\n  government readily met all IMF/WB targets in December 1993. The budget\r\n  deficit had been dramatically reduced; the government workforce had\r\n  been cut by 25%; large amounts of domestic debt had been retired;\r\n  arrears to the IMF, World Bank, and other creditors had been reduced.\r\n  On the negative side, continued incursions by the Liberian rebels,\r\n  bandits, and army deserters in southern and eastern Sierra Leone have\r\n  severely strained the economy and threaten economically critical\r\n  regions of the country.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $4.5 billion (FY93 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  NA\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $1,000 (1993 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  35% (1992)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  NA%\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues:\r\n  $68 million\r\nexpenditures:\r\n  $118 million, including capital expenditures of $28 million (1992\r\n  est.)\r\nExports:\r\n  $149 million (f.o.b., FY92)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  rutile 51%, bauxite 19%, diamonds 15%, coffee 5%\r\npartners:\r\n  US, UK, Belgium, Germany, other Western Europe\r\nImports:\r\n  $131 million (c.i.f., FY92)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  foodstuffs 33%, machinery and equipment 19%, fuels 16%\r\npartners:\r\n  US, EC countries, Japan, China, Nigeria\r\nExternal debt:\r\n  $633 million (FY92 est.)\r\nIndustrial production:\r\n  growth rate -1.2% (FY91);

The old\r\n  Czechoslovakia, even though highly industrialized by East European\r\n  standards, suffered from an aging capital plant, lagging technology,\r\n  and a deficiency in energy and many raw materials. In January 1991,\r\n  approximately one year after the end of communist control of Eastern\r\n  Europe, the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic launched a sweeping\r\n  program to convert its almost entirely state-owned and controlled\r\n  economy to a market system. In 1991-92 these measures resulted in\r\n  privatization of some medium- and small-scale economic activity and\r\n  the setting of more than 90% of prices by the market - but at a cost\r\n  in inflation, unemployment, and lower output. For Czechoslovakia as a\r\n  whole inflation in 1991 was roughly 50% and output fell 15%. In 1992\r\n  in Slovakia, inflation slowed to an estimated 8.7% and the estimated\r\n  fall in GDP was a more moderate 7%. In 1993 GDP fell roughly 5%, with\r\n  the disruptions from the separation from the Czech lands probably\r\n  accounting for half the decline; exports to the Czech Republic fell\r\n  about 35%. Bratislava adopted an austerity program in June and\r\n  devalued its currency 10% in July. In 1993, inflation rose an\r\n  estimated 23%, unemployment topped 14%, and the budget deficit\r\n  exceeded the IMF target of $485 million by over $200 million. By\r\n  yearend 1993 Bratislava estimated that 29% of GDP was being produced\r\n  in the private sector. The forecast for 1994 is gloomy; Bratislava\r\n  optimistically projects no growth in GDP, 17% unemployment, a $425\r\n  million budget deficit, and 12% inflation. At best, if Slovakia stays\r\n  on track with the IMF, GDP could fall by only 2-3% in 1994 and\r\n  unemployment could be held under 18%, but a currency devaluation will\r\n  likely drive inflation above 15%.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $31 billion (1993 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  -5% (1993 est.)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $5,800 (1993 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  23% (1993 est.)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  14.4% (1993 est.)\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues:\r\n  $4.5 billion\r\nexpenditures:\r\n  $5.2 billion, including capital expenditures of $NA (1993 est.)\r\nExports:\r\n  $5.13 billion (f.o.b., 1993 est.)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  machinery and transport equipment;

Because of its strong ties to Western Europe and the small\r\n  scale of damage during its brief fight for independence from\r\n  Yugoslavia, Slovenia has the brightest prospects among the former\r\n  Yugoslav republics for economic recovery over the next few years. The\r\n  dissolution of Yugoslavia, however, has led to severe short-term\r\n  dislocations in production, employment, and trade ties. For example,\r\n  overall industrial production has fallen 26% since 1990; particularly\r\n  hard hit have been the iron and steel, machine-building, chemical, and\r\n  textile industries. Meanwhile, the continued fighting in other former\r\n  Yugoslav republics has led to further destruction of long-established\r\n  trade channels and to an influx of tens of thousands of Croatian and\r\n  Bosnian refugees. The key program for breaking up and privatizing\r\n  major industrial firms was established in late 1992. Despite slow\r\n  progress in privatization Slovenia has reasonable prospects for an\r\n  upturn in 1994. Bright spots for encouraging Western investors are\r\n  Slovenia's comparatively well-educated work force, its developed\r\n  infrastructure, and its Western business attitudes, but instability in\r\n  Croatia is a deterrent. Slovenia in absolute terms is a small economy,\r\n  and a little Western investment would go a long way.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $15 billion (1993 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  0% (1993 est.)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $7,600 (1993 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  22.9% (1993)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  15.5% (1993)\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues:\r\n  $NA\r\nexpenditures:\r\n  $NA, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\nExports:\r\n  $5.1 billion (f.o.b., 1993)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  machinery and transport equipment 38%, other manufactured goods 44%,\r\n  chemicals 9%, food and live animals 4.6%, raw materials 3%, beverages\r\n  and tobacco less than 1% (1992)\r\npartners:\r\n  Germany 27%, Croatia 14%, Italy 13%, France 9% (1992)\r\nImports:\r\n  $5.3 billion (c.i.f., 1993)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  machinery and transport equipment 35%, other manufactured goods 26.7%,\r\n  chemicals 14.5%, raw materials 9.4%, fuels and lubricants 7%, food and\r\n  live animals 6% (1992)\r\npartners:\r\n  Germany 23%, Croatia 14%, Italy 14%, France 8%, Austria 8% (1992)\r\nExternal debt:\r\n  $1.9 billion\r\nIndustrial production:\r\n  growth rate -2.8% (1993);

Moreover, much of the economy has been devastated by\r\n  the civil war. Agriculture is the most important sector, with\r\n  livestock accounting for about 40% of GDP and about 65% of export\r\n  earnings. Nomads and seminomads who are dependent upon livestock for\r\n  their livelihoods make up more than half of the population. Crop\r\n  production generates only 10% of GDP and employs about 20% of the work\r\n  force. The main export crop is bananas; sugar, sorghum, and corn are\r\n  grown for the domestic market. The small industrial sector is based on\r\n  the processing of agricultural products and accounts for less than 10%\r\n  of GDP. Greatly increased political turmoil in 1991-93 has resulted in\r\n  a substantial drop in output, with widespread famine.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $3.4 billion (1993 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  NA%\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $500 (1993 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  210% (1989)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  NA%\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues:\r\n  $NA\r\nexpenditures:\r\n  $NA, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\nExports:\r\n  $58 million (1990 est.)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  bananas, live animals, fish, hides\r\npartners:\r\n  Saudi Arabia, Italy, FRG (1986)\r\nImports:\r\n  $249 million (1990 est.)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  petroleum products, foodstuffs, construction materials\r\npartners:\r\n  US 13%, Italy, FRG, Kenya, UK, Saudi Arabia (1986)\r\nExternal debt:\r\n  $1.9 billion (1989)\r\nIndustrial production:\r\n  growth rate 0% (1990); accounts for 4% of GDP\r\nElectricity:\r\ncapacity:\r\n  former 75,000 kW is almost completely shut down by the destruction of\r\n  the civil war; UN, relief organizations, and foreign military units in\r\n  Somalia use their own portable power systems\r\nproduction:\r\n  NA\r\nconsumption per capita:\r\n  NA\r\nIndustries:\r\n  a few small industries, including sugar refining, textiles, petroleum\r\n  refining; probably shut down by the widespread destruction during the\r\n  civil war\r\nAgriculture:\r\n  dominant sector, led by livestock raising (cattle, sheep, goats);\r\n  crops - bananas, sorghum, corn, mangoes, sugarcane; not\r\n  self-sufficient in food; distribution of food disrupted by civil\r\n  strife; fishing potential largely unexploited\r\nEconomic aid:\r\nrecipient:\r\n  US commitments, including Ex-Im (FY70-89), $639 million; Western\r\n  (non-US) countries, ODA and OOF bilateral commitments (1970-89), $3.8\r\n  billion; OPEC bilateral aid (1979-89), $1.1 billion; Communist\r\n  countries (1970-89), $336 million\r\nCurrency:\r\n  1 Somali shilling (So.

In contrast, most of the remaining\r\n  population suffers from the poverty patterns of the Third World,\r\n  including unemployment and lack of job skills. The main strength of\r\n  the economy lies in its rich mineral resources, which provide\r\n  two-thirds of exports. Economic developments for the remainder of the\r\n  1990s will be driven largely by the new government's attempts to\r\n  improve black living conditions and to set the country on an\r\n  aggressive export-led growth path. The shrinking economy in recent\r\n  years has absorbed less than 5% of the more than 300,000 workers\r\n  entering the labor force annually.

Real GDP\r\n  barely grew in 1992 and declined by approximately 1% in 1993.\r\n  Unemployment, now nearly one-fourth of the workforce, and the sharp\r\n  downturn in business investment have contributed to sagging domestic\r\n  demand. Devaluation of the peseta since September 1992 has made\r\n  Spanish exports more competitive, but an export-led recovery in 1994\r\n  will depend largely on economic recovery in Spain's major market - the\r\n  other EU nations. A solid recovery will also require appropriate\r\n  domestic policy actions, including controlling the budget deficit and\r\n  wage increases, reforming labor market regulations, and possibly\r\n  loosening monetary policy another notch. Foreign investors,\r\n  principally from other EU countries, have invested over $60 billion in\r\n  Spain since 1986. Despite the recession, inflation remained at about\r\n  5% in 1993. The main source of inflationary pressure is the fiscal\r\n  deficit.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $498 billion (1993)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  -1% (1993)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $12,700 (1993)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  4.5% (1993 est.)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  22% (yearend 1993)\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues:\r\n  $97.7 billion\r\nexpenditures:\r\n  $128 billion, including capital expenditures of $NA (1993 est.)\r\nExports:\r\n  $72.8 billion (f.o.b., 1993)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  cars and trucks, semifinished manufactured goods, foodstuffs,\r\n  machinery\r\npartners:\r\n  EC 71.2%, US 4.8%, other developed countries 7.9% (1992)\r\nImports:\r\n  $92.5 billion (c.i.f., 1993)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  machinery, transport equipment, fuels, semifinished goods, foodstuffs,\r\n  consumer goods, chemicals\r\npartners:\r\n  EC 60.7%, US 7.4%, other developed countries 11.5%, Middle East 5.9%\r\n  (1992)\r\nExternal debt:\r\n  $90 billion (1993 est.)\r\nIndustrial production:\r\n  growth rate -1.7% (1992)\r\nElectricity:\r\ncapacity:\r\n  46,600,000 kW\r\nproduction:\r\n  157 billion kWh\r\nconsumption per capita:\r\n  4,000 kWh (1992)\r\nIndustries:\r\n  textiles and apparel (including footwear), food and beverages, metals\r\n  and metal manufactures, chemicals, shipbuilding, automobiles, machine\r\n  tools, tourism\r\nAgriculture:\r\n  accounts for about 5% of GDP and 14% of labor force;

The economy is dominated by\r\n  governmental entities that account for more than 70% of new\r\n  investment. The private sector's main areas of activity are\r\n  agriculture and trading, with most private industrial investment\r\n  predating 1980. The economy's base is agriculture, which employs 80%\r\n  of the work force. Industry mainly processes agricultural items.\r\n  Sluggish economic performance over the past decade, attributable\r\n  largely to declining annual rainfall, has reduced levels of per capita\r\n  income and consumption. A large foreign debt and huge arrearages\r\n  continue to cause difficulties. In 1990 the International Monetary\r\n  Fund took the unusual step of declaring Sudan noncooperative because\r\n  of its nonpayment of arrearages to the Fund. The government\r\n  implemented a comprehensive economic reform program in 1992 that\r\n  included slashing the fiscal deficit, liberalizing foreign exchange\r\n  regulations, and lifting most price controls, but it had backtracked\r\n  on most reforms by mid-1993 because of its fear of generating a\r\n  domestic backlash. The government's failure to pursue economic reform,\r\n  its continued prosecution of the civil war, and its growing\r\n  international isolation have led to a further deterioration of the\r\n  non-agricultural sectors of the economy during 1993. Agriculture, on\r\n  the other hand, after several disappointing years, enjoyed favorable\r\n  growing conditions in 1993, and its strong performance produced an\r\n  overall growth rate in GNP of about 7%.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $21.5 billion (1993 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  7% (FY93 est.)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $750 (1993 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  105% (FY93 est.)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  30% (FY93 est.)\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues:\r\n  $374.4 million\r\nexpenditures:\r\n  $1.2 billion, including capital expenditures of $214 million (1993\r\n  est.)\r\nExports:\r\n  $350 million (f.o.b., FY93 est.)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  cotton 52%, sesame, gum arabic, peanuts\r\npartners:\r\n  Western Europe 46%, Saudi Arabia 14%, Eastern Europe 9%, Japan 9%, US\r\n  3% (FY88)\r\nImports:\r\n  $1.1 billion (c.i.f., FY93 est.)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  foodstuffs, petroleum products, manufactured goods, machinery and\r\n  equipment, medicines and chemicals, textiles\r\npartners:\r\n  Western Europe 32%, Africa and Asia 15%, US 13%, Eastern Europe 3%\r\n  (FY88)\r\nExternal debt:\r\n  $17 billion (June 1993 est.)\r\nIndustrial production:\r\n  growth rate 6.8% (FY93 est.);

The economy has been in\r\n  trouble since the Dutch ended development aid in 1982. A drop in world\r\n  bauxite prices which started in the late 1970s and continued until\r\n  late 1986 was followed by the outbreak of a guerrilla insurgency in\r\n  the interior that crippled the important bauxite sector. Although the\r\n  insurgency has since ebbed and the bauxite sector recovered,\r\n  Paramaribo has failed to initiate the economic reforms necessary to\r\n  stabilize the economy or win renewed Dutch aid disbursements.

It has a modern distribution system, excellent\r\n  internal and external communications, and a skilled labor force.\r\n  Timber, hydropower, and iron ore constitute the resource base of an\r\n  economy that is heavily oriented toward foreign trade. Privately owned\r\n  firms account for about 90% of industrial output, of which the\r\n  engineering sector accounts for 50% of output and exports. In the last\r\n  few years, however, this extraordinarily favorable picture has been\r\n  clouded by inflation, growing unemployment, and a gradual loss of\r\n  competitiveness in international markets. Although Prime Minister\r\n  BILDT's center-right minority coalition had hoped to charge ahead with\r\n  free-market-oriented reforms, a skyrocketing budget deficit - almost\r\n  14% of GDP in FY94 projections - and record unemployment have\r\n  forestalled many of the plans. Unemployment in 1993 is estimated at\r\n  around 8% with another 5% in job training. Continued heavy foreign\r\n  exchange speculation forced the government to cooperate in late 1992\r\n  with the opposition Social Democrats on two crisis packages - one a\r\n  severe austerity pact and the other a program to spur industrial\r\n  competitiveness - which basically set economic policy through 1997. In\r\n  November 1992, Sweden broke its tie to the EC's ECU, and the krona has\r\n  since depreciated about 25% against the dollar. The government hopes\r\n  the boost in export competitiveness from the depreciation will help\r\n  lift Sweden out of its 3-year recession. To curb the budget deficit\r\n  and bolster confidence in the economy, BILDT continues to propose cuts\r\n  in welfare benefits, subsidies, defense, and foreign aid. Sweden\r\n  continues to harmonize its economic policies with those of the EU in\r\n  preparation for scheduled membership by early 1995, which will help to\r\n  broaden European economic unity.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $153.7 billion (1993)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  -2.7% (1993)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $17,600 (1993)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  4.4% (1993 est.)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  8.2% (1993 est.)\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues:\r\n  $45.1 billion\r\nexpenditures:\r\n  $73.1 billion, including capital expenditures of $NA (FY94)\r\nExports:\r\n  $49.7 billion (f.o.b., 1993 est.)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  machinery, motor vehicles, paper products, pulp and wood, iron and\r\n  steel products, chemicals, petroleum and petroleum products\r\npartners:\r\n  EC 55.8% (Germany 15%, UK 9.7%, Denmark 7.2%, France 5.8%), EFTA 17.4%\r\n  (Norway 8.4%, Finland 5.1%), US 8.2%, Central and Eastern Europe 2.5%\r\n  (1992)\r\nImports:\r\n  $42.3 billion (c.i.f., 1993 est.)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  machinery, petroleum and petroleum products, chemicals, motor\r\n  vehicles, foodstuffs, iron and steel, clothing\r\npartners:\r\n  EC 53.6% (Germany 17.9%, UK 6.3%, Denmark 7.5%, France 4.9%), EFTA\r\n  (Norway 6.6%, Finland 6%), US 8.4%, Central and Eastern Europe 3%\r\n  (1992)\r\nExternal debt:\r\n  $19.5 billion (1992 est.)\r\nIndustrial production:\r\n  growth rate 0.8% (1993 est.)\r\nElectricity:\r\ncapacity:\r\n  39,716,000 kW\r\nproduction:\r\n  142.5 billion kWh\r\nconsumption per capita:\r\n  16,560 kWh (1992)\r\nIndustries:\r\n  iron and steel, precision equipment (bearings, radio and telephone\r\n  parts, armaments), wood pulp and paper products, processed foods,\r\n  motor vehicles\r\nAgriculture:\r\n  animal husbandry predominates, with milk and dairy products accounting\r\n  for 37% of farm income;

The Swiss finally\r\n  emerged from a three-year recession in mid-1993 and posted a -0.6% GDP\r\n  growth for the year. After a three-year struggle with inflation, the\r\n  Swiss central bank's tight monetary policies have begun to pay off.\r\n  Inflation slowed to 3.3% in 1993 from about 4% in 1992 and is expected\r\n  to slow down further to 1.5% in 1994. Unemployment, however, will\r\n  continue to be a problem over the near term. Swiss unemployment\r\n  reached 5.1% in 1993 and will likely remain at that level through 1994\r\n  before declining in 1995. The voters' rejection of a referendum on\r\n  membership in the EEA, which was supported by most political,\r\n  business, and financial leaders has raised doubts that the country can\r\n  maintain its preeminent prosperity and leadership in commercial\r\n  banking in the twenty-first century. Despite these problems, Swiss per\r\n  capita output, general living standards, education and science, health\r\n  care, and diet remain unsurpassed in Europe. The country has few\r\n  natural resources except for the scenic natural beauty that has made\r\n  it a world leader in tourism.

Economic growth averaged roughly 10% in\r\n  1990-93. The Gulf war provided Syria an aid windfall of nearly $5\r\n  billion dollars from Arab, European, and Japanese donors. These\r\n  inflows more than offset Damascus's war-related costs and will help\r\n  Syria cover some of its debt arrears, restore suspended credit lines,\r\n  and initiate selected military and civilian purchases. In 1992 the\r\n  government spurred economic development by loosening controls on\r\n  domestic and foreign investment while maintaining strict political\r\n  controls. For the long run, Syria's economy is still saddled with a\r\n  large number of poorly performing public sector firms, and industrial\r\n  productivity remains to be improved.

Its economy is highly agricultural (43% of the work force);\r\n  it has specialized in growing cotton for export and must import a\r\n  large share of its food. Its industry (14% of the work force) produces\r\n  aluminum, hydropower, machinery, and household appliances. Nearly all\r\n  petroleum products must be imported. Constant political turmoil and\r\n  continued dominance of former Communist officials have slowed the\r\n  process of economic reform and brought near economic collapse while\r\n  limiting foreign assistance. Tajikistan is in the midst of a prolonged\r\n  monetary crisis in which it is attempting to continue to use the\r\n  Russian ruble as its currency while its neighbors have switched to new\r\n  independent currencies; Russia is unwilling to advance sufficient\r\n  rubles without attaching stringent reform conditions.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $6.9 billion (1993 estimate from\r\n  the UN International Comparison Program, as extended to 1991 and\r\n  published in the World Bank's World Development Report 1993;

The economy is\r\n  heavily dependent on agriculture, which accounts for about 58% of GDP,\r\n  provides 85% of exports, and employs 90% of the work force. Industry\r\n  accounts for 8% of GDP and is mainly limited to processing\r\n  agricultural products and light consumer goods. The economic recovery\r\n  program announced in mid-1986 has generated notable increases in\r\n  agricultural production and financial support for the program by\r\n  bilateral donors.

One of the more advanced developing countries in Asia, Thailand\r\n  depends on exports of manufactures and the development of the service\r\n  sector to fuel the country's rapid growth. The trade and current\r\n  account deficits fell in 1992; much of Thailand's recent imports have\r\n  been for capital equipment suggesting that the export sector is poised\r\n  for further growth. With foreign investment slowing, Bangkok is\r\n  working to increase the generation of domestic capital. Prime Minister\r\n  CHUAN's government - Thailand's fifth government in less than two\r\n  years - is pledged to continue Bangkok's probusiness policies, and the\r\n  return of a democratically elected government has improved business\r\n  confidence. Nevertheless, CHUAN must overcome divisions within his\r\n  ruling coalition to complete much needed infrastructure development\r\n  programs if Thailand is to remain an attractive place for business\r\n  investment. Over the longer-term, Bangkok must produce more college\r\n  graduates with technical training and upgrade workers' skills to\r\n  continue its rapid economic development.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $323 billion (1993 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  7.8% (1993 est.)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $5,500 (1993 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  4.1% (1992 est.)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  3.1% (1992 est.)\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues:\r\n  $21.36 billion\r\nexpenditures:\r\n  $22.4 billion, including capital expenditures of $6.24 billion (1993\r\n  est.)\r\nExports:\r\n  $28.4 billion (f.o.b., 1992)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  machinery and manufactures 76.9%, agricultural products 14.9%,\r\n  fisheries products 5.9% (1992)\r\npartners:\r\n  US 22%, Japan 18%, Singapore 8%, Hong Kong 5%, Germany 4%, Netherlands\r\n  4%, UK 4%, Malaysia, France, China (1992)\r\nImports:\r\n  $37.6 billion (c.i.f., 1992)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  capital goods 41.4%, intermediate goods and raw materials 32.8%,\r\n  consumer goods 10.4%, oil 8.2%\r\npartners:\r\n  Japan 29.3%, US 11.4%, Singapore 7.6%, Taiwan 5.5%, Germany 5.4%,\r\n  South Korea 4.6%, Malaysia 4.2%, China 3.3%, Hong Kong 3.3%, UK (1992)\r\nExternal debt:\r\n  $33.4 billion (1991)\r\nIndustrial production:\r\n  growth rate 9% (1992);

Its\r\n  economic decline will continue unless ties are reforged or enlarged\r\n  with its neighbors Serbia and Montenegro, Albania, Greece, and\r\n  Bulgaria. The economy depends on outside sources for all of its oil\r\n  and gas and its modern machinery and parts. Continued political\r\n  turmoil, both internally and in the region as a whole, prevents any\r\n  swift readjustments of trade patterns and economic programs. The\r\n  country's industrial output and GDP are expected to decline further in\r\n  1994. The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia's geographical\r\n  isolation, technological backwardness, and potential political\r\n  instability place it far down the list of countries of interest to\r\n  Western investors. Resolution of the dispute with Greece and an\r\n  internal commitment to economic reform would help to encourage foreign\r\n  investment over the long run. In the immediate future, the worst\r\n  scenario for the economy would be the spread of fighting across its\r\n  borders.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - purchasing power equivalent -  $2.2 billion (1993 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  -14.7% (1992 est.)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $1,000 (1993 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  13% monthly average (1993 est.)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  27% (1993 est.)\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues:\r\n  $NA\r\nexpenditures:\r\n  $NA, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\nExports:\r\n  $889 million (1993)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  manufactured goods 40%, machinery and transport equipment 14%,\r\n  miscellaneous manufactured articles 23%, raw materials 7.6%, food\r\n  (rice) and live animals 5.7%, beverages and tobacco 4.5%, chemicals\r\n  4.7% (1990)\r\npartners:\r\n  principally Serbia and Montenegro and the other former Yugoslav\r\n  republics, Germany, Greece, Albania\r\nImports:\r\n  $963 million (1993)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  fuels and lubricants 19%, manufactured goods 18%, machinery and\r\n  transport equipment 15%, food and live animals 14%, chemicals 11.4%,\r\n  raw materials 10%, miscellaneous manufactured articles 8.0%, beverages\r\n  and tobacco 3.5% (1990)\r\npartners:\r\n  other former Yugoslav republics, Greece, Albania, Germany, Bulgaria\r\nExternal debt:\r\n  $840 million (1992)\r\nIndustrial production:\r\n  growth rate -14% (1993 est.)\r\nElectricity:\r\ncapacity:\r\n  1,600,000 kW\r\nproduction:\r\n  6.3 billion kWh\r\nconsumption per capita:\r\n  2,900 kWh (1992)\r\nIndustries:\r\n  low levels of technology predominate, such as, oil refining by\r\n  distillation only;

Primary agricultural exports are cocoa, coffee, and\r\n  cotton, which together generate about 30% of total export earnings.\r\n  Togo is self-sufficient in basic foodstuffs when harvests are normal.\r\n  In the industrial sector phosphate mining is by far the most important\r\n  activity, although it has suffered from the collapse of World\r\n  phosphate prices and increased foreign competition. Togo serves as a\r\n  regional commercial and trade center. The government's decade-long IMF\r\n  and World Bank supported effort to implement economic reform measures\r\n  to encourage foreign investment and bring revenues in line with\r\n  expenditures has stalled. Political unrest, including private and\r\n  public sector strikes throughout 1992 and 1993, has jeopardized the\r\n  reform program and has disrupted vital economic activity.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $3.3 billion (1993 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  NA\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $800 (1993 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  0.5% (1991 est.)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  NA%\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues:\r\n  $284 million\r\nexpenditures:\r\n  $407 million, including capital expenditures of $NA (1991 est.)\r\nExports:\r\n  $558 million (f.o.b., 1991)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  phosphates, cotton, cocoa, coffee\r\npartners:\r\n  EC 40%, Africa 16%, US 1% (1990)\r\nImports:\r\n  $636 million (f.o.b., 1991)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  machinery and equipment, consumer goods, food, chemical products\r\npartners:\r\n  EC 57%, Africa 17%, US 5%, Japan 4% (1990)\r\nExternal debt:\r\n  $1.3 billion (1991)\r\nIndustrial production:\r\n  growth rate 9% (1991 est.);

Coconuts, bananas, and vanilla\r\n  beans are the main crops and make up two-thirds of exports. The\r\n  country must import a high proportion of its food, mainly from New\r\n  Zealand. The manufacturing sector accounts for only 11% of GDP.\r\n  Tourism is the primary source of hard currency earnings, but the\r\n  island remains dependent on sizable external aid and remittances to\r\n  offset its trade deficit. The economy continued to grow in 1993\r\n  largely because of a rise in squash exports, increased aid flows, and\r\n  several large construction projects. The government is now turning its\r\n  attention to further development of the private sector and the\r\n  reduction of the budget deficit.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $200 million (1993 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  4% (1993 est.)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $2,000 (1993 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  9% (FY92)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  NA%\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues:\r\n  $36.4 million\r\nexpenditures:\r\n  $68.1 million, including capital expenditures of $33.2 million (1991\r\n  est.)\r\nExports:\r\n  $18.8 million (f.o.b., FY92 est.)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  vanilla, fish, root crops, coconut oil, squash\r\npartners:\r\n  Japan 34%, US 17%, Australia 13%, NZ 13% (FY91)\r\nImports:\r\n  $68.3 million (c.i.f., FY92 est.)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  food products, machinery and transport equipment, manufactures, fuels,\r\n  chemicals\r\npartners:\r\n  NZ 33%, Australia 22%, US 8%, Japan 8% (FY91)\r\nExternal debt:\r\n  $47.5 million (FY91)\r\nIndustrial production:\r\n  growth rate 1.5% (FY92);

Seven\r\n  successive years of economic contraction were followed by small gains\r\n  in output in 1990-91 of 1.2% and 0.9%, in turn followed by small\r\n  declines in 1992-93 of roughly 1.0%.

The economy grew rapidly in\r\n  the mid-1980s, GDP growth averaging 5.4% in 1983-85. Following a\r\n  foreign exchange crisis caused by a sharp drop in agricultural output\r\n  and tourism, combined with the oil price collapse in 1986, Tunisia\r\n  inaugurated an IMF-sponsored economic rehabilitation scheme.\r\n  Subsequent government structural reforms have helped liberalize and\r\n  open the economy, and GDP growth has been positive since the start of\r\n  the program. A sharp rebound in tourism from the downturn caused by\r\n  the Gulf war and strong agricultural performance boosted real GDP\r\n  growth to more than 8% in 1992; growth fell back to 2.6% in 1993.\r\n  Further privatization and further improvements in government\r\n  administrative efficiency are among the challenges for the future.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $34.3 billion (1993 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  2.6% (1993 est.)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $4,000 (1993 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  4.5% (1993 est.)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  16.2% (1993 est.)\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues:\r\n  $4.3 billion\r\nexpenditures:\r\n  $5.5 billion, including capital expenditures to $NA (1993 est.)\r\nExports:\r\n  $4.1 billion (f.o.b., 1993)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  hydrocarbons, agricultural products, phosphates and chemicals\r\npartners:\r\n  EC countries 75%, Middle East 10%, Algeria 2%, India 2%, US 1%\r\nImports:\r\n  $6.4 billion (c.i.f., 1993)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  industrial goods and equipment 57%, hydrocarbons 13%, food 12%,\r\n  consumer goods\r\npartners:\r\n  EC countries 70%, US 5%, Middle East 2%, Japan 2%, Switzerland 1%,\r\n  Algeria 1%\r\nExternal debt:\r\n  $7.7 billion (1993 est.)\r\nIndustrial production:\r\n  growth rate 5% (1989);

Sparked by the downgrading in mid-January of Turkey's\r\n  international credit rating by two US credit rating agencies, the\r\n  crisis stems from two years of loose fiscal and monetary policies that\r\n  have exacerbated inflation and allowed the public debt, money supply,\r\n  and current account deficit to explode. Under Prime Minister CILLER,\r\n  Ankara has followed seriously flawed policies that have destroyed\r\n  public confidence in the government's ability to manage the economy.\r\n  Inflation is now running at an annual rate of 107% and the public\r\n  sector deficit is equivalent to 16% of GDP. Turkish firms have been\r\n  hurt by high interest rates and a dramatic drop in consumer demand.\r\n  Three Turkish banks have folded and the stock market has fallen 48%\r\n  since the beginning of the year. Economic growth may drop to between\r\n  0% and 2% in 1994, compared to 7.3% in 1993. Moreover, the government\r\n  is facing a severe cash crunch. In March 1994, the treasury came close\r\n  to defaulting on a loan, and official foreign currency reserves are\r\n  equal to less than two months' worth of imports. The unprecedented\r\n  effort by the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) to raise the economic\r\n  costs of its insurgency against the Turkish state is adding to\r\n  Turkey's economic problems. Attacks against the tourism industry have\r\n  cut tourist revenues, which account for about 3% of GDP, while\r\n  economic activity in southeastern Turkey, where most of the violence\r\n  occurs, has dropped considerably. To cope with the economic crisis and\r\n  instill domestic and international investor confidence in the fragile\r\n  coalition government, CILLER has asked the IMF to endorse a\r\n  stabilization package she introduced in early April 1994. Negotiations\r\n  are underway for a standby agreement, which would give Turkey access\r\n  to $450 million this year and enable her cash-starved government to\r\n  return to the foreign capital markets.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $312.4 billion (1993)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  7.3% (1993)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $5,100 (1993)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  65% (1993)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  12.2% (1993)\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues:\r\n  $36.5 billion\r\nexpenditures:\r\n  $47.6 billion, including capital expenditures of $5 billion (1994)\r\nExports:\r\n  $14.9 billion (f.o.b., 1992)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  manufactured products 72%, foodstuffs 23%, mining products 4%\r\npartners:\r\n  EC countries 53%, US 6%, Russia 4%, Saudi Arabia 3%\r\nImports:\r\n  $22.9 billion (c.i.f., 1992)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  manufactured products 68%, fuels 17%, foodstuffs 4%\r\npartners:\r\n  EC countries 44%, US 11%, Saudi Arabia 7%, Russia 5%\r\nExternal debt:\r\n  $59.4 billion (1993)\r\nIndustrial production:\r\n  growth rate 4.3% (1992);

Half of its irrigated land is planted in cotton; it is the\r\n  world's tenth largest producer. It also is the world's fourth largest\r\n  producer of natural gas and has the fifth largest reserves.\r\n  Furthermore, Turkmenistan has substantial oil resources; its two oil\r\n  refineries make it an exporter of refined products. Profiting from the\r\n  move toward market prices for its oil and gas resources, Turkmenistan\r\n  has suffered the least economic decline of the 15 states of the former\r\n  USSR. With an authoritarian ex-Communist regime in power and a\r\n  tribally based social structure, Turkmenistan has taken a cautious\r\n  approach to questions of economic reform, using the profits from its\r\n  gas and cotton exports to sustain a generally inefficient economy.\r\n  Economic restructuring and privatization have just begun, and price\r\n  liberalization and price increases have been accompanied by generous\r\n  wage hikes and subsidies. At the same time, Turkmenistan faces serious\r\n  constraints on its gas and oil earnings because of the inability of\r\n  its traditional regional customers to pay for the current level of\r\n  purchases and the lack of pipeline access to hard currency markets.\r\n  Faced with financial shortfalls, rampant inflation, and the desire to\r\n  ensure a stable currency, the regime has become more receptive to\r\n  market reforms yet still seeks to offer widespread social benefits to\r\n  its population and to retain state domination over the economy.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $13 billion (1993 estimate from\r\n  the UN International Comparison Program, as extended to 1991 and\r\n  published in the World Bank's World Development Report 1993;

(GDP remains\r\n  below the levels of the early 1970s, as does industrial production.)\r\n  Agriculture is the most important sector of the economy, employing\r\n  over 80% of the work force. Coffee is the major export crop and\r\n  accounts for the bulk of export revenues. Since 1986 the government\r\n  has acted to rehabilitate and stabilize the economy by undertaking\r\n  currency reform, raising producer prices on export crops, increasing\r\n  prices of petroleum products, and improving civil service wages. The\r\n  policy changes are especially aimed at dampening inflation, which was\r\n  running at over 300% in 1987, and boosting production and export\r\n  earnings. In 1990-93, the economy has turned in a solid performance\r\n  based on continued investment in the rehabilitation of infrastructure,\r\n  improved incentives for production and exports, and gradually\r\n  improving domestic security.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $24.1 billion (1993 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  6% (1993 est.)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $1,200 (1993 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  41.5% (1992 est.)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  NA%\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues:\r\n  $365 million\r\nexpenditures:\r\n  $545 million, including capital expenditures of $165 million (1989\r\n  est.)\r\nExports:\r\n  $150 million (f.o.b., 1992 est.)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  coffee 97%, cotton, tea\r\npartners:\r\n  US 25%, UK 18%, France 11%, Spain 10%\r\nImports:\r\n  $513 million (c.i.f., 1992 est.)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  petroleum products, machinery, cotton piece goods, metals,\r\n  transportation equipment, food\r\npartners:\r\n  Kenya 25%, UK 14%, Italy 13%\r\nExternal debt:\r\n  $1.9 billion (1991 est.)\r\nIndustrial production:\r\n  growth rate 8% (1992 est.);

Its fertile\r\n  black soil generated more than one-fourth of Soviet agricultural\r\n  output, and its farms provided substantial quantities of meat, milk,\r\n  grain and vegetables to other republics. Likewise, its diversified\r\n  heavy industry supplied equipment and raw materials to industrial and\r\n  mining sites in other regions of the former USSR. In 1992 the\r\n  Ukrainian Government liberalized most prices and erected a legal\r\n  framework for privatizing state enterprises while retaining many\r\n  central economic controls and continuing subsidies to state production\r\n  enterprises. In November 1992 the new Prime Minister KUCHMA launched a\r\n  new economic reform program promising more freedom to the agricultural\r\n  sector, faster privatization of small and medium enterprises, and\r\n  stricter control over state subsidies. In 1993, however, severe\r\n  internal political disputes over the scope and pace of economic reform\r\n  and payment arrears on energy imports have led to further declines in\r\n  output, and inflation of 50% or more per month by the last quarter. In\r\n  first quarter 1994, national income and industrial output were less\r\n  than two-thirds the first quarter 1993 figures, according to official\r\n  statistics. At the same time an increasing number of people are\r\n  developing small private businesses and exploiting opportunities in\r\n  non-official markets. Even so, the magnitude of the problems and the\r\n  slow pace in building new market-oriented institutions preclude a\r\n  near-term recovery of output to the 1990 level. A vital economic\r\n  concern in 1994 will continue to be Russia's decisions on the prices\r\n  and quantities of oil and gas to be shipped to the Ukraine.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $205.4 billion (1993 estimate from\r\n  the UN International Comparison Program, as extended to 1991 and\r\n  published in the World Bank's World Development Report 1993; and as\r\n  extrapolated to 1993 using official Ukrainian statistics, which are\r\n  very uncertain because of major economic changes since 1990)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  -16% (1993 est.)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $3,960 (1993 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  45% per month (1993)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  0.4% officially registered;

Its wealth is\r\n  based on oil and gas output (about 40% of GDP), and the fortunes of\r\n  the economy fluctuate with the prices of those commodities. Since\r\n  1973, the UAE has undergone a profound transformation from an\r\n  impoverished region of small desert principalities to a modern state\r\n  with a high standard of living. At present levels of production, crude\r\n  oil reserves should last for over 100 years. Although much stronger\r\n  economically than most Gulf states, the UAE faces similar problems\r\n  with weak international oil prices and the pressures for cuts in OPEC\r\n  oil production quotas. The UAE government is encouraging increased\r\n  privatization within the economy.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $63.8 billion (1993 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  1% (1993 est.)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $24,000 (1993 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  3.5% (1992 est.)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  NEGL% (1988)\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues:\r\n  $4.3 billion\r\nexpenditures:\r\n  $4.8 billion, including capital expenditures of $NA (1993 est)\r\nExports:\r\n  $22.6 billion (f.o.b., 1993 est.)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  crude oil 66%, natural gas, re-exports, dried fish, dates\r\npartners:\r\n  Japan 39%, Singapore 5%, Korea 4%, Iran 4%, India 4% (1991)\r\nImports:\r\n  $18 billion (f.o.b., 1993 est.)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  manufactured goods, machinery and transport equipment, food\r\npartners:\r\n  Japan 14%, UK 9%, US 8%, Germany 6% (1992)\r\nExternal debt:\r\n  $11 billion (1993 est.)\r\nIndustrial production:\r\n  growth rate 1.7% (1992 est.);

The economy is essentially capitalistic; over the past\r\n  thirteen years the ruling Tories have greatly reduced public ownership\r\n  and contained the growth of social welfare programs. Agriculture is\r\n  intensive, highly mechanized, and efficient by European standards,\r\n  producing about 60% of food needs with only 1% of the labor force. The\r\n  UK has large coal, natural gas, and oil reserves, and primary energy\r\n  production accounts for 12% of GDP, one of the highest shares of any\r\n  industrial nation. Services, particularly banking, insurance, and\r\n  business services, account by far for the largest proportion of GDP\r\n  while industry continues to decline in importance, now employing only\r\n  25% of the work force and generating only 21% of GDP. The economy is\r\n  emerging out of its 3-year recession with only weak recovery in 1993;\r\n  even so, the economy fared better in 1993 than the economies of most\r\n  other European countries. Unemployment is hovering around 10% of the\r\n  labor force. The government in 1992 adopted a pro-growth strategy,\r\n  cutting interest rates sharply and removing the pound from the\r\n  European exchange rate mechanism. Excess industrial capacity probably\r\n  will moderate inflation which for the first time in a decade is below\r\n  the EC average. The major economic policy question for Britain in the\r\n  1990s is the terms on which it participates in the financial and\r\n  economic integration of Europe.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $980.2 billion (1993)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  2.1% (1993)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $16,900 (1993)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  2.6% (1993)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  10.3% (1993)\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues:\r\n  $325.5 billion\r\nexpenditures:\r\n  $400.9 billion, including capital expenditures of $33 billion (1993\r\n  est.)\r\nExports:\r\n  $190.1 billion (f.o.b., 1993)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  manufactured goods, machinery, fuels, chemicals, semifinished goods,\r\n  transport equipment\r\npartners:\r\n  EC countries 56.7% (Germany 14.0%, France 11.1%, Netherlands 7.9%), US\r\n  10.9%\r\nImports:\r\n  $221.6 billion (c.i.f., 1993)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  manufactured goods, machinery, semifinished goods, foodstuffs,\r\n  consumer goods\r\npartners:\r\n  EC countries 51.7% (Germany 14.9%, France 9.3%, Netherlands 8.4%), US\r\n  11.6%\r\nExternal debt:\r\n  $16.2 billion (June 1992)\r\nIndustrial production:\r\n  growth rate 2.2% (1993 est.)\r\nElectricity:\r\ncapacity:\r\n  99,000,000 kW\r\nproduction:\r\n  317 billion kWh\r\nconsumption per capita:\r\n  5,480 kWh (1992)\r\nIndustries:\r\n  production machinery including machine tools, electric power\r\n  equipment, equipment for the automation of production, railroad\r\n  equipment, shipbuilding, aircraft, motor vehicles and parts,\r\n  electronics and communications equipment, metals, chemicals, coal,\r\n  petroleum, paper and paper products, food processing, textiles,\r\n  clothing, and other consumer goods\r\nAgriculture:\r\n  accounts for only 1.5% of GDP and 1% of labor force;

The economy is market oriented with\r\n  most decisions made by private individuals and business firms and with\r\n  government purchases of goods and services made predominantly in the\r\n  marketplace. In 1989 the economy enjoyed its seventh successive year\r\n  of substantial growth, the longest in peacetime history. The expansion\r\n  featured moderation in wage and consumer price increases and a steady\r\n  reduction in unemployment to 5.2% of the labor force. In 1990,\r\n  however, growth slowed to 1% because of a combination of factors, such\r\n  as the worldwide increase in interest rates, Iraq's invasion of Kuwait\r\n  in August, the subsequent spurt in oil prices, and a general decline\r\n  in business and consumer confidence. In 1991 output fell by 1%,\r\n  unemployment grew, and signs of recovery proved premature. Growth\r\n  picked up to 2.6% in 1992 and to 3.0% in 1993. Unemployment, however,\r\n  declined only gradually, the increase in GDP being mainly attributable\r\n  to gains in output per worker. Ongoing economic problems for the\r\n  remainder of the 1990s include inadequate investment in economic\r\n  infrastructure, rapidly rising medical costs, and sizable budget and\r\n  trade deficits.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $6.379 trillion (1993)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  3% (1993)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $24,700 (1993)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  3% (1993)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  6% (May 1994)\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues:\r\n  $1.1535 trillion\r\nexpenditures:\r\n  $1.4082 trillion, including capital expenditures of $NA (1993 est.)\r\nExports:\r\n  $449 billion (f.o.b., 1993 est.)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  capital goods, automobiles, industrial supplies and raw materials,\r\n  consumer goods, agricultural products\r\npartners:\r\n  Western Europe 24.3%, Canada 22.1%, Japan 10.5% (1993 est.)\r\nImports:\r\n  $582 billion (c.i.f., 1993 est.)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  crude oil and refined petroleum products, machinery, automobiles,\r\n  consumer goods, industrial raw materials, food and beverages\r\npartners:\r\n  Canada, 19.3%, Western Europe 18.1%, Japan 18.1% (1993 est.)\r\nExternal debt:\r\n  $NA\r\nIndustrial production:\r\n  growth rate 4.6% (1993);

Economic development has been held back by\r\n  excessive government regulation of economic detail and 50% to 130%\r\n  inflation. After several years of sluggish growth, real GDP jumped by\r\n  about 7.5% in 1992. The rise is attributable mainly to an increase in\r\n  Argentine demand for Uruguayan exports, particularly agricultural\r\n  products and electricity. In a major step toward greater regional\r\n  economic cooperation, Uruguay in 1991 had joined Brazil, Argentina,\r\n  and Paraguay in forming the Southern Cone Common Market (Mercosur). A\r\n  referendum in December 1992 overturned key portions of landmark\r\n  privatization legislation, dealing a serious blow to President\r\n  LACALLE's broad economic reform plan. Hampered by a slowdown in the\r\n  agricultural sector, the economy grew at only 2% in 1993 compared with\r\n  7.5% in 1992. Although inflation declined for the second consecutive\r\n  year, a surge in the money supply, rising food prices, a record trade\r\n  deficit, and an increase in the government deficit toward the end of\r\n  the year foreshadowed troubles ahead in 1994.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $19 billion (1993 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  2% (1993 est.)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $6,000 (1993 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  50% (1993 est.)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  8.8% (1993 est.)\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues:\r\n  $2.9 billion\r\nexpenditures:\r\n  $3 billion, including capital expenditures of $388 million (1991 est.)\r\nExports:\r\n  $1.6 billion (f.o.b., 1993 est.)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  wool and textile manufactures, beef and other animal products,\r\n  leather, rice\r\npartners:\r\n  Brazil, Argentina, US, China, Italy\r\nImports:\r\n  $2 billion (f.o.b., 1993 est.)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  machinery and equipment, vehicles, chemicals, minerals, plastics\r\npartners:\r\n  Brazil, Argentina, US, Nigeria\r\nExternal debt:\r\n  $4.2 billion (1993)\r\nIndustrial production:\r\n  growth rate 4.2% (1992 est.), accounts for almost 25% of GDP\r\nElectricity:\r\ncapacity:\r\n  2,168,000 kW\r\nproduction:\r\n  5.96 billion kWh\r\nconsumption per capita:\r\n  1,900 kWh (1992)\r\nIndustries:\r\n  meat processing, wool and hides, sugar, textiles, footwear, leather\r\n  apparel, tires, cement, fishing, petroleum refining, wine\r\nAgriculture:\r\n  accounts for 12% of GDP;

It is one of the poorest states\r\n  of the former USSR with 60% of its population living in overpopulated\r\n  rural communities. Nevertheless, Uzbekistan is the world's third\r\n  largest cotton exporter, a major producer of gold and natural gas, and\r\n  a regionally significant producer of chemicals and machinery. Since\r\n  independence, the government has sought to prop up the Soviet-style\r\n  command economy with subsidies and tight controls on prices and\r\n  production. Such policies have buffered the economy from the sharp\r\n  declines in output and high inflation experienced by many other former\r\n  Soviet republics. By late 1993, however, they had become increasingly\r\n  unsustainable as inflation soared and Russia forced the Uzbek\r\n  Government to introduce its own currency. Faced with mounting economic\r\n  problems, the government has increased its cooperation with\r\n  international financial institutions, announced an acceleration of\r\n  privatization, and stepped up efforts to attract foreign investors.\r\n  Nevertheless, the regime is likely to resist full-fledged market\r\n  reforms.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $53.7 billion (1993 estimate from\r\n  the UN International Comparison Program, as extended to 1991 and\r\n  published in the World Bank's World Development Report 1993;

Former President PEREZ introduced an economic\r\n  readjustment program when he assumed office in February 1989. Lower\r\n  tariffs and the removal of price controls, a free market exchange\r\n  rate, and market-linked interest rates threw the economy into\r\n  confusion, causing an 8% decline in GDP in 1989. The economy recovered\r\n  part way in 1990 and grew by 9.7% in 1991 and 6.8% in 1992; economic\r\n  activity fell by 1% in 1993, primarily because of business concerns\r\n  over political instability.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $161 billion (1993 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  -1% (1993 est.)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $8,000 (1993 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  46% (1993 est.)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  8.2% (1993 est.)\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues:\r\n  $9.8 billion\r\nexpenditures:\r\n  $11.9 billion, including capital expenditures of $103 million (1993\r\n  est.)\r\nExports:\r\n  $14.2 billion (f.o.b., 1993 est.)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  petroleum 77%, bauxite and aluminum, steel, chemicals, agricultural\r\n  products, basic manufactures\r\npartners:\r\n  US and Puerto Rico 42%, Japan, Netherlands, Italy\r\nImports:\r\n  $11 billion (f.o.b., 1993 est.)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  raw materials, machinery and equipment, transport equipment,\r\n  construction materials\r\npartners:\r\n  US 50%, Germany, Japan, Netherlands, Canada\r\nExternal debt:\r\n  $28.5 billion (1993)\r\nIndustrial production:\r\n  growth rate 6.1% (1992 est.);

Most prices are now fully decontrolled, and the\r\n  Vietnamese currency has been effectively devalued and floated at world\r\n  market rates. In addition, the scope for private sector activity has\r\n  been expanded, primarily through decollectivization of the\r\n  agricultural sector and introduction of laws giving legal recognition\r\n  to private business. Nearly three-quarters of export earnings are\r\n  generated by only two commodities, rice and crude oil. Led by industry\r\n  and construction, the economy did well in 1993 with output rising\r\n  perhaps 7%. However, the industrial sector remains burdened by\r\n  uncompetitive state-owned enterprises the government is unwilling or\r\n  unable to privatize. Unemployment looms as a serious problem with\r\n  roughly 25% of the workforce without jobs and with population growth\r\n  swelling the ranks of the unemployed yearly.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GNP - purchasing power equivalent - $72 billion (1993 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  7% (1993 est.)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $1,000 (1993 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  5.2% (1993 est.)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  25% (1993 est.)\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues:\r\n  $1.9 billion\r\nexpenditures:\r\n  $2 billion, including capital expenditures of $NA (1992)\r\nExports:\r\n  $2.6 billion (f.o.b., 1993 est.)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  petroleum, rice, agricultural products, marine products, coffee\r\npartners:\r\n  Japan, Hong Kong, Thailand, Germany, Indonesia\r\nImports:\r\n  $3.1 billion (f.o.b., 1993 est.)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  petroleum products, steel products, railroad equipment, chemicals,\r\n  medicines, raw cotton, fertilizer, grain\r\npartners:\r\n  Hong Kong, Japan, Indonesia, South Korea, Taiwan\r\nExternal debt:\r\n  $3.4 billion Western countries;

Industries using advanced technology or requiring sizable\r\n  investment have been discouraged by a lack of local capital and\r\n  restrictive Israeli policies. Capital investment consists largely of\r\n  residential housing, not productive assets that would enable local\r\n  Palestinian firms to compete with Israeli industry. A major share of\r\n  GNP has traditionally been derived from remittances of workers\r\n  employed in Israel and Persian Gulf states.

The bulk of export earnings\r\n  comes from the sale of coconut oil and copra.

Tourism has become the most\r\n  important growth industry, and construction of the first international\r\n  hotel is under way.

Average\r\n  growth of 1% in the GDP of industrialized countries (57% of GWP in\r\n  1993) and average growth of 6% in the GDP of less developed countries\r\n  (37% of GWP) were partly offset by a further 10% drop in the GDP of\r\n  the former USSR/Eastern Europe area (now only 6% of GWP). Within the\r\n  industrialized world the US posted a 3% growth rate whereas both Japan\r\n  and the 12-member European Union (formerly the European Community) had\r\n  zero growth. With the notable exception of Japan at 2.5%, unemployment\r\n  was typically 6-11% in the industrial world. The US accounted for 22%\r\n  of GWP in 1993; Western Europe accounted for 22.5%; and Japan\r\n  accounted for 9%. These are the three \"economic superpowers\" which are\r\n  presumably destined to compete for mastery in international markets on\r\n  into the 21st century. As for the less developed countries, China,\r\n  India, and the Four Dragons--South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and\r\n  Singapore--once again posted good records; however, many other\r\n  countries, especially in Africa, continued to suffer from drought,\r\n  rapid population growth, inflation, and civil strife. Central Europe,\r\n  especially Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic, made considerable\r\n  progress in moving toward \"market-friendly\" economies, whereas the 15\r\n  ex-Soviet countries typically experienced further declines in output\r\n  of 10-15%. Externally, the nation-state, as a bedrock\r\n  economic-political institution, is steadily losing control over\r\n  international flows of people, goods, funds, and technology.\r\n  Internally, the central government in a number of cases is losing\r\n  control over resources as separatist regional movements - typically\r\n  based on ethnicity - gain momentum, e.g., in the successor states of\r\n  the former Soviet Union, in former Yugoslavia, and in India. In\r\n  Western Europe, governments face the difficult political problem of\r\n  channeling resources away from welfare programs in order to increase\r\n  investment and strengthen incentives to seek employment. The addition\r\n  of nearly 100 million people each year to an already overcrowded globe\r\n  is exacerbating the problems of pollution, desertification,\r\n  underemployment, epidemics, and famine. Because of their own internal\r\n  problems, the industrialized countries have inadequate resources to\r\n  deal effectively with the poorer areas of the world, which, at least\r\n  from the economic point of view, are becoming further marginalized.\r\n  (For the specific economic problems of each country, see the\r\n  individual country entries in this volume.)\r\nNational product:\r\n  GWP (gross world product) - purchasing power equivalent - $29 trillion\r\n  (1993 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  2% (1993 est.)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $5,200 (1993 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\ndeveloped countries:\r\n  5% (1993 est.)\r\ndeveloping countries:\r\n  50% (1993 est.)\r\nnote:\r\n  these figures vary widely in individual cases\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  developed countries typically 6%-11%;

the annual production of cereals, for instance, has\r\n  risen by 50%, from about 1.2 billion metric tons to about 1.8 billion\r\n  metric tons; production increases have resulted mainly from increased\r\n  yields rather than increases in planted areas; while global production\r\n  is sufficient for aggregate demand, about one-fifth of the world's\r\n  population remains malnourished, primarily because local production\r\n  cannot adequately provide for large and rapidly growing populations,\r\n  which are too poor to pay for food imports;

Future economic development\r\n  depends heavily on Western-assisted development of its moderate oil\r\n  resources. Former South Yemen's willingness to merge stemmed partly\r\n  from the steady decline in Soviet economic support. The low level of\r\n  domestic industry and agriculture have made northern Yemen dependent\r\n  on imports for practically all of its essential needs. Large trade\r\n  deficits have been compensated for by remittances from Yemenis working\r\n  abroad and by foreign aid. Because of the Gulf crisis, remittances\r\n  have dropped substantially. Once self-sufficient in food production,\r\n  northern Yemen has become a major importer. Land once used for export\r\n  crops - cotton, fruit, and vegetables - has been turned over to\r\n  growing a shrub called qat, whose leaves are chewed for their\r\n  stimulant effect by Yemenis and which has no  significant export\r\n  market. Economic growth in former South Yemen has been constrained by\r\n  a lack of incentives, partly stemming from centralized control over\r\n  production decisions, investment allocation, and import choices.\r\n  Nominal growth in 1994-95 is apt to be under 3% annually because of\r\n  low oil prices and political deadlock that is causing a lack of\r\n  economic cooperation and leadership.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - exchange rate conversion - $9 billion (1993 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  3.1% (1993 est.)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $800 (1993 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  55% (1993 est.)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  30% (December 1992)\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues:\r\n  $NA\r\nexpenditures:\r\n  $NA, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\nExports:\r\n  $695 million (f.o.b., 1993 est.)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  crude oil, cotton, coffee, hides, vegetables, dried and salted fish\r\npartners:\r\n  Italy 55%, US 32%, Jordan 5% (1991)\r\nImports:\r\n  $1.6 billion (f.o.b., 1993 est.)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  textiles and other manufactured consumer goods, petroleum products,\r\n  sugar, grain, flour, other foodstuffs, cement, machinery, chemicals\r\npartners:\r\n  UAE 6%, Japan 6%, Saudi Arabia 6%, Kuwait 6%, US 6% (1991)\r\nExternal debt:\r\n  $7 billion (1993)\r\nIndustrial production:\r\n  growth rate NA%, accounts for 18% of GDP\r\nElectricity:\r\ncapacity:\r\n  714,000 kW\r\nproduction:\r\n  1.224 billion kWh\r\nconsumption per capita:\r\n  120 kWh (1992)\r\nIndustries:\r\n  crude oil production and petroleum refining;

While meaningful\r\n  economic figures are difficult to come by, Zaire's hyperinflation, the\r\n  largest government deficit ever, and plunging mineral production have\r\n  made the country one of the world's poorest. Most formal transactions\r\n  are conducted in hard currency as indigenous banknotes have lost\r\n  almost all value, and a barter economy now flourishes in all but the\r\n  largest cities. Most individuals and families hang on grimly through\r\n  subsistence farming and petty trade. The government has not been able\r\n  to meet its financial obligations to the International Momentary Fund\r\n  or put in place the financial measures advocated by the IMF. Although\r\n  short-term prospects for improvement are dim, improved political\r\n  stability would boost Zaire's long-term potential to effectively\r\n  exploit its vast wealth of mineral and agricultural resources.\r\nNational product:\r\n  GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $21 billion (1993 est.)\r\nNational product real growth rate:\r\n  -6% (1992 est.)\r\nNational product per capita:\r\n  $500 (1993 est.)\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  35%-40% per month (1992 est.)\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  NA%\r\nBudget:\r\nrevenues:\r\n  $NA\r\nexpenditures:\r\n  $NA, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\nExports:\r\n  $1.5 billion (f.o.b., 1992 est.)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  copper, coffee, diamonds, cobalt, crude oil\r\npartners:\r\n  US, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, UK, Japan, South Africa\r\nImports:\r\n  $1.2 billion (f.o.b., 1992 est.)\r\ncommodities:\r\n  consumer goods, foodstuffs, mining and other machinery, transport\r\n  equipment, fuels\r\npartners:\r\n  South Africa, US, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, UK\r\nExternal debt:\r\n  $9.2 billion (May 1992 est.)\r\nIndustrial production:\r\n  growth rate NA%\r\nElectricity:\r\ncapacity:\r\n  2,580,000 kW\r\nproduction:\r\n  6 billion kWh\r\nconsumption per capita:\r\n  160 kWh (1991)\r\nIndustries:\r\n  mining, mineral processing, consumer products (including textiles,\r\n  footwear, and cigarettes), processed foods and beverages, cement,\r\n  diamonds\r\nAgriculture:\r\n  cash crops - coffee, palm oil, rubber, quinine;

Economic difficulties stem from a\r\n  chronically depressed level of copper production and ineffective\r\n  economic policies. In 1991 real GDP fell by 2% and in 1992 by 3% more.\r\n  An annual population growth of 3% has brought a decline in per capita\r\n  GDP of 50% over the past decade.

The manufacturing sector, based on agriculture\r\n  and mining, produces a variety of goods and contributes 35% to GDP.\r\n  Mining accounts for only 5% of both GDP and employment, but supplies\r\n  of minerals and metals account for about 40% of exports. Wide\r\n  fluctuations in agricultural production over the past six years have\r\n  resulted in an uneven growth rate, one that on average has matched the\r\n  3% annual increase in population. Helped by an IMF/World Bank\r\n  structural adjustment program, output rose 3.5% in 1991.

The\r\nUnited Nations, however, permits the seat and nameplate of the SFRY to\r\nremain, permits the SFRY mission to continue to function, and continues to\r\nfly the flag of the former Yugoslavia. For a variety of reasons, a number\r\nof other organizations have not yet taken action with regard to the\r\nmembership of the former Yugoslavia. The World Factbook therefore continues\r\nto list Yugoslavia under international organizations where the SFRY seat\r\nremains or where no action has yet been taken.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nadvanced developing countries\r\n\r\nanother term for those less developed countries (LDCs) with particularly\r\nrapid industrial development; see newly industrializing economies (NIEs)\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nAfrican, Caribbean, and Pacific Countries (ACP)\r\n\r\nestablished -
