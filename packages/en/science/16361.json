It was the last city that gave up\r\nHarold's unlucky cause and surrendered to William the Conqueror, and the\r\nlast that fell in the no less unlucky cause of the Stuart king against the\r\nParliamentarians. In much earlier times it was held by the famous Twentieth\r\nLegion, the _Valens Victrix_, as the key of the Roman dominion in the\r\nnorth-west of Britain, and at present it has peculiarities of position, as\r\nwell as of architecture, which make it unique in England and a lodestone to\r\nAmericans. Curiously planted on the border of the newest and most bustling\r\nmanufacturing district in England, close to the coalfields of North Wales,\r\nthe mines of Lancashire, the quays of its sea-rival Liverpool and the mills\r\nof grimy, wealthy Manchester, it still exercises, besides its artistic and\r\nhistoric supremacy, a _bonâ fide_ ecclesiastical sway over most of these\r\nnew places. It is the first ancient city accessible to American travellers,\r\nmany of whom have given practical tokens of their affectionate remembrance\r\nof it by largely subscribing to the fund for the restoration of the\r\ncathedral, a work that has already cost some eighty thousand pounds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CAER-GAI.]\r\n\r\nThe neighborhood of Chester is as suggestive of antiquity and foreigners as\r\nthe city itself. Volumes might be written about the quaint, Dutch-like\r\nscenery of the low rich land reclaimed from the sea; the broad, sandy\r\nestuary of the Dee, with the square-headed peninsula, the Wirrall, which\r\ndivides this quiet river from the noisy Mersey; the Hoylake, Parkgate and\r\nNeston fisher-folk on the sandy shores, with their queer lives, monotonous\r\nscratching-up of mussels and cockles, a never-failing trade, their terms of\r\npraise--\"the biggest scrat,\" for instance, \"in all the island,\" being the\r\nform of commendation for the woman who can with her rake at the end of a\r\nlong pole scratch up most shellfish in a given time; the low, fertile green\r\npastures, the creamy cheese and the eight yearly cheese-fairs. The city\r\nitself is the most foreign-looking in all England, and the inhabitants have\r\nthe good taste to be proud of this. The river Dee--Milton's \"wizard\r\nstream\"--celebrated both by English and Welsh bards, is not seen to as much\r\nadvantage under the walls of the Roman \"camp\" (_castra_=Chester) as\r\nelsewhere, but its bridges serve to supply the want of fine scenery,\r\nespecially the Old Bridge, which crosses the river just at its bend, and\r\nwhose massive pointed arches took the place, when they were first built, of\r\na ferry by which the city was entered at the \"Ship Gate,\" whence now you\r\nlook over \"the Cop\" or high bank on the right side of the stream, and view,\r\nas from a dike in Holland, the reclaimed land stretching eight miles beyond\r\nChester, though the resemblance ceases at Saltney, where behind the\r\niron-works tower the Welsh hills--Moel-Famman conspicuous above the\r\nrest--that bound the Vale of Clwyd.\r\n\r\nThe Dee is more a Welsh than an English river. It rises in the bleak\r\nmountain-region of Merionethshire, the most intensely Welsh of all\r\ncounties, above Bala Lake, which is commonly but incorrectly called its\r\nsource. Thence it flows through the Vale of Llangollen, famous in poetry,\r\nand waters the meadows of Wynnestay, the splendid home of one of Wales's\r\nmost national representatives, Sir Watkin Williams Wynn, and only beyond\r\nthat does it become English by flowing round and into Cheshire. On a very\r\ntiny scale the Dee follows something of the course of the Rhine: three\r\nstreamlets combine to form it; these unite at the village of Llanwchllyn,\r\nand the river flows on, a mere mountain-torrent, past an old farmhouse,\r\nCaer-gai, lying on a desolate moor at the head of Bala Lake, and through\r\nthe lake itself, after which its scenery alternates, like the Rhine's below\r\nConstance, between rocky gorges and flat moist meadows dotted with hamlets,\r\nchurches and towns. Bala--otherwise Lin-Jegid and Pimblemere (\"Lake of the\r\nFive Parishes\")--has some traditional connection with the great British\r\nepic, or rather with its accessories--the _Morte d'Arthur_--of which\r\nTennyson has availed himself in _Enid_, mentioning that Enid's gentle\r\nministrations soothed the wounded Geraint\r\n\r\n    As the south-west that blowing Bala Lake,\r\n    Fills all the sacred Dee.\r\n\r\nArthur's own home, according to Spenser, was at the source of the Dee:\r\nVortigern's castle was near by on the head-waters of the Conway; and \"under\r\nthe foot of Rauran's mossy base\" was the dwelling of old Timon, where\r\nMerlin came and gave to his care the wonderful infant who was to become the\r\nChristian Hercules of Britain. \"Rauran\" is the mountain which in Welsh is\r\nArran-Pon-Llin, and which with its rocky shelves overlooks the yews of\r\nBala's churches and the unaccustomed shade trees which the little town\r\nboasts in its principal streets. The lake, quiet and hardly visited as it\r\nis now, has great resources which are likely to be called upon in the\r\nfuture, and a survey was made ten years ago with a view of supplying\r\nLiverpool, Manchester, Blackburn, Birkenhead, etc. with water whenever a\r\nfresh demand for it should arise. This would imply the building of a\r\nbreakwater at the narrow outlet of the lake, the damming up of a few\r\nmountain passes, and the \"impounding\" of a tributary of the Dee below the\r\nlake--the Tryweryn, which has an extensive drainage-area; but these works\r\nare still only projected.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BALA.]\r\n\r\nThere is scarcely an English brook that has not some historical\r\nassociations, some poetical reminiscences, some attractions beyond those of\r\nscenery. Wherever water, forest and meadow were combined, an abbey was\r\ngenerally planted. Bala Lake, with its fishing-rights, once belonged to the\r\nCistercian abbey of Basingwerk, while the Dee just above Llangollen was the\r\nproperty of the abbey of Valle Crucis, whose beautiful ruins still stand on\r\nits banks. Before we reach them we pass by the country of the Welsh hero,\r\nOwen Glendower, from whom are descended many of the families of this\r\nneighborhood and others--the Vaughans, for instance; by Glendower's prison\r\nat Corwen, and the Parliament House at Dolgelly, where he signed a treaty\r\nwith France, and where the beautiful oak carving of the roof would alone\r\nrepay a visitor for his trouble in getting there. The Dee is for the most\r\npart wanting in striking natural features, but here and there steep rocks\r\nenclose its foaming waters; deep banks covered with trees break the rugged\r\nshore-line; a village, such as Llanderfel with a tumbledown bridge, lies\r\nnestled in the valley; and coracles shoot here and there over the stream.\r\nThese primitive boats, basketwork covered with hides, or, as used now,\r\ncanvas coated with tar, are propelled by a paddle, and are much used for\r\nnetting salmon. Near Bangor the fishermen are so skilful that they\r\ngenerally win in the coracle-races got up periodically by enthusiastic\r\nrevivalists of old national sports.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: REMAINS OF VALLE CRUCIS ABBEY.]\r\n\r\nLlangollen Vale has a beauty of its own, the family likeness of which to\r\nthat of all valleys in the hearts of mountains makes it none the less\r\nwelcome. The picturesqueness of thatched houses and a dilapidation of\r\nmasonry which only age makes beautiful marks the difference between this\r\nvalley and the Alpine ones with their trim, clean toy houses, or the\r\nTransatlantic ones with their square, solid, black log huts and huge\r\nwell-sweeps; otherwise the fresh greenery, the purple mountain-shadows, the\r\nsubdued sounds, no one knows whence, the sense of peace and solitude, are\r\nakin to every other beautiful valley-scene of mingled wildness and\r\ncultivation. A traveller can hardly help making comparisons, yet much\r\nescapes him of the peculiar charm that hangs round every place, and is too\r\nsubtle to disclose itself to the eye of a mere passer. You must live at\r\nleast six months in one place before its true character unfolds: the broad\r\nbeauties you see at once, but it needs the microscope of habit to find out\r\nthe rarest charms. Therefore it is much easier to descant on the tangible,\r\nstriking beauty of Valle Crucis Abbey than on the aggregate loveliness of\r\nLlangollen Vale; and perhaps it is this lack of familiarity that leads\r\nnovelists, poets and others to dwell so much more and with such detail on\r\nbuildings than on natural scenery. It may not be given them to understand\r\nupon how much higher a plane of beauty stands a bed of ferns on a rocky\r\nledge, a clump of trees even on a flat meadow, and especially a tangled\r\nforest-scene or a view of distant mountains in a sunset glow, or the\r\nsurface of water undotted by a sail, than the highest effect of man-made\r\nbeauty, be it even York Minster or the Parthenon. What man does has value\r\nby reason of the meaning in it, and of course man cannot but fall short of\r\nthe perfection of his own meaning; whereas Nature is of herself perfection,\r\nand perfection in which there is no effort. Valle Crucis is hardly a rival\r\nof Fountains or Rivaulx. The Cistercians in the beginning of their\r\nfoundation were reformers, ascetic, and essentially agriculturists. Their\r\ngreat leader, Bernard of Clairvaux, the advocate of silence and work, once\r\nsaid, \"Believe me, I have learnt more from trees than ever I learnt from\r\nmen.\" But decay came even into this community of farmer-monks, and the\r\npraise and panegyric of the abbey, as handed down to us by a Welsh poet,\r\nbetray unconsciously things hardly to the credit of a monastic house, for\r\nthe abbot, \"the pope of the glen,\" he tells us, gave entertainments \"like\r\nthe leaves in summer,\" with \"vocal and instrumental music,\" wine, ale and\r\ncurious dishes of fish and fowl, \"like a carnival feast,\" and \"a thousand\r\napples for dessert.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OWEN GLENDOWER'S PRISON.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE PARLIAMENT HOUSE, DOLGELLY.]\r\n\r\nThe river-scenery changes below Llangollen, and gives us first a glimpse of\r\na wooded, narrow valley, then of the unsightly accessories of the great\r\nNorth Wales coalfield, after which it enters upon a typically English\r\nphase--low undulating hills and moist, rich meadows divided by luxuriant\r\nhedges and dotted with single spreading trees. The hedgerow timber of\r\nCheshire is beautiful, and to a great extent makes up for the want of\r\ntracts of wooded land. This country is not, like the Midland counties and\r\nthe great Fen district, violently or exclusively agricultural, and these\r\nhedges and trees, which are gratefully kept up for the sake of the shade\r\nthey afford to the cattle, show a very different temper among the farmers\r\nfrom that utilitarianism which marks the men of Leicester shire, Lincoln,\r\nNottingham, Norfolk, or Rutland. There even great land-owners are often\r\nobliged to humor their tenants, and keep the unwelcome hedges trimmed so as\r\nnot to interpose two feet of shade between them and the wheat-crop; and as\r\noften as possible hedges are replaced by ugly stone walls or wooden fences.\r\nIt is only in their own grounds that landlords can afford to court\r\npicturesqueness, and in this part of the country the American who is said\r\nto have objected to hedges because they were unfit for seats whence to\r\nadmire the landscape, might safely sit down anywhere; only, as matters are\r\nseldom perfectly arranged, there is very little to admire but a flat\r\nexpanse of wheat, barley and grass. This part of Cheshire has hardly more\r\ndiversity in its river-scenery, but the mere presence of trees and green\r\narbors makes it a pleasant picture, while here and there, as at Overton\r\n(this is Welsh, however, and belongs to Flintshire), a church-tower comes\r\nin to complete the scene. Here the Dee winds about a good deal, and\r\nreceives its beautiful, dashing tributary, the Alyn, which runs through the\r\nVale of Gresford and waters the park of Trevallyn Old Hall, one of the\r\nloveliest of old English homes. Its pointed gables and great clustering\r\nstacks of chimneys, its mullioned and diamond-paned windows, its\r\nfinely-wooded park, all realize the stranger's ideal of the antique\r\nmanor-house. This neighborhood is studded with country-houses in all styles\r\nof architecture, from the characteristic national to the uncomfortable and\r\ncold foreign type. Houses that were meant to stand in ilex-groves under a\r\npurple sky and a sun of bronze look forlorn and uninviting under the gray\r\nsky of England and amid its trees leafless for so many months in the year:\r\nhome associations seem impossible in a porticoed house suggestive of\r\noutdoor living and the relegation of chambers to the use of a mere refuge\r\nfrom the weather. For many of these places are no more than villas\r\nenlarged, and might be set down with advantage to themselves in the\r\nRegent's Park in London, the very acme of the commonplace. On the other\r\nhand, all the traditional associations that go with an English hall\r\npresuppose a national style of architecture. Even florid Tudor, even sturdy\r\n\"Queen Anne,\" can stand juxtaposition with groups of horses, dogs and\r\nhuntsmen; Christmas cheer and Christmas weather set them off all the\r\nbetter; leafless trees are no drawback; the house looks warmer, coseyer,\r\nmore home-like, the worse the blast and rush without. A roaring fire is\r\nnatural to the huge hall fireplace, while in a mosaic-paved \"ante-room\" or\r\na frescoed \"saloon\" it looks foreign and out of place. Many an odd Welsh\r\nand English house has unfortunately disappeared to make room for a cold,\r\nunsuccessful monstrosity that reminds one of a mammoth railway-station or a\r\nnew hotel; and when Welsh names are tacked on to these absurd dwellings the\r\ncontrast is as painful as it is forcible. Such, for instance, is\r\nBryn-y-Pys, on the Dee--a house you might guess to belong to a Liverpool\r\nmerchant who had trusted to a common builder for a comfortable home.\r\nOverton Cottage, on the other side, fills in with its walks and plantations\r\nan abrupt bend of the river, and the view from the up-going road at its\r\nback is very lovely, though the scene is purely pastoral. Overton\r\nChurchyard is one of the \"seven wonders\" of North Wales: it has a very trim\r\nand stately appearance, not that ragged, free if melancholy,\r\noutspreadedness which distinguishes many country cemeteries, that\r\nunpremeditated luxuriance of creepers and flowers, blossoming bushes and\r\ngrasses, that make up at least half of one's pleasant reminiscences of such\r\nplaces. How much more interesting to find an old tomb or quaint \"brass\"\r\nunder the temple of a wild rosebush or in the firm clasp of an ivy-root\r\nthan to walk up to it and read the inscription newly scraped and cleaned by\r\nthe voluble attendant who volunteers to show you the place! The great elms\r\nby Overton Church and the half-timbered and thatched houses crowding up to\r\nits gates somewhat make up for the splendor of the coped wall and new\r\nmonuments in the churchyard. A scene wholly old is the Erbistock Ferry,\r\nwhich one might mistake for a rope-ferry on the Mosel. The cottage looks\r\nlike the dilapidated lodge of an old monastery, and here, at least, is no\r\ntrimness. Two walls with a flight of steps in each enclose a grass terrace\r\nbetween them, and trees and bushes straggle to the edge of the river,\r\nhardly keeping clear of the swinging rope. Coracles are sometimes used for\r\nferrying--also punts. Bangor is a familiar name to students of church\r\nhistory, and to those who are not, the startling tale of the massacre of\r\ntwelve hundred British monks by the Saxon and heathen king of Northumbria,\r\nwho conquered Chester and invaded Wales in the seventh century, is repeated\r\nby the local guides. At present, Bangor is interesting to anglers and to\r\nlovers of curiosities--to the former as a good salmon-ground, and to the\r\nlatter for the quaint verses, which, though trivial in themselves, borrow a\r\nvalue from the date of their inscription and the \"laws\" to which they\r\nrefer. They are on the wall of the lower story of the bell-tower:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IN THE VALE OF LLANGOLLEN.]\r\n\r\n    If that to ring you would come here,\r\n    You must ring well with hand and ear;\r\n    But if you ring in spur or hat,\r\n    Fourpence always is due for that;\r\n    But if a bell you overthrow,\r\n    Sixpence is due before you go;\r\n    But if you either swear or curse,\r\n    Twelvepence is due; pull out your purse.\r\n    Our laws are old, they are not new;\r\n    Therefore the clerk must have his due.\r\n    If to our laws you do consent,\r\n    Then take a bell: we are content.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LLANGOLLEN.]\r\n\r\nFarndon Bridge and Wrexham Church (the latter looks like a small cathedral\r\nto the unpractised eye) are the last Welsh points of attraction before the\r\nDee becomes quite an English river. Malpas (_mauvais pas_ = \"bad step\"), on\r\nthe English bank, is significantly so-called from its situation as a border\r\ntown: the rector, too, might consider it not ill named, as regards the odd\r\npartition of the church tithes, which has been in force from time\r\nimmemorial, and has given rise to an explanatory legend concerning a\r\ntravelling king whom the resident curate wisely entertained in the absence\r\nof the rector, receiving for his guerdon a promise of an equal share in the\r\nincome, not only for himself, but for all future curates. In the upper\r\nrectory (the lower is the curate's house) was born Bishop Heber in 1783,\r\nand in the early years of this century, before missionary meetings were as\r\ncommon as they are now, the young clergyman wrote on the spur of the\r\nmoment, with only one word corrected, the well-known hymn, \"From\r\nGreenland's Icy Mountains.\" A missionary sermon was announced for Sunday at\r\nWrexham, the vicarage of Heber's father-in-law, Shirley, and the want of a\r\nsuitable hymn was felt. He was asked on Saturday to write one, and did so,\r\nseated at a window of the old vicarage-house. It was printed that evening,\r\nand sung the next day in Wrexham Church. The original manuscript is in a\r\ncollection at Liverpool, and the printer who set up the type when a boy was\r\nstill living at Wrexham within the last twenty years.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHESTER, FROM THE ALDFORD ROAD.]\r\n\r\nThe river now makes a turn, sweeping along into English ground and making\r\nalmost a natural moat round Chester, the great Roman camp whose form and\r\nintersecting streets still bear the stamp of Roman regularity, and whose\r\nhistory long bore traces of the influence of Roman inflexibility mingled\r\nwith British dash. The view of the city is fine from the Aldford road (or\r\nOld Ford, where a Roman pavement is sometimes visible in the bed of the\r\nstream), with the cathedral and St. John's towering over the peaks and\r\ngables that shoot up above the walls. The mention of the ford brings to\r\nmind a famous crossing of the river during the civil wars. It was just\r\nbefore the battle of Rowton Moor, which Charles I. watched from the tower\r\nthat now bears his name; and Sir Marmaduke Langdale, one of his leal\r\nsoldiers, wishing to send the king notice of his having crossed the Dee at\r\nFarndon Bridge and pressing on the Parliamentarians, bade Colonel Shakerley\r\nconvey the message as speedily as possible. The latter, to avoid the long\r\ncircuit by the bridge, galloped to the Dee, took a wooden tub used for\r\nslaughtering swine, employed \"a batting-staff, used for batting of coarse\r\nlinen,\" as an oar, put his servant in the tub, his horse swimming by him,\r\nand once across left the tub in charge of the man while he rode to the\r\nking, delivered his message and returned to cross over the same way.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CORACLES.]\r\n\r\nEaton and Wynnestay are the grandest of the Dee country-seats, though not\r\nthe most interesting as to architecture. The former, like many Italian\r\nhouses, has its park open to the public, and is an exception to the\r\njealously-guarded places in most parts of England, but its avenues, rather\r\nformal though very magnificent, are approached by lodges. The Wrexham\r\navenue leads to a farmhouse called Belgrave, and here is the\r\nchristening-point of the new, fashionable London of society, of novelists\r\nand of contractors. Another like avenue leads to Pulford, where there is\r\nanother lodge: a third leads from Grosvenor Bridge to the deer-park, and a\r\nfourth to the village of Aldford. The hall is an immense pile, strikingly\r\nlike, at first glance, the Houses of Parliament, with the Victoria Tower\r\n(this in the hall is one hundred and seventy feet high, and built above the\r\nchapel), and the style is sixteenth-century French, florid and costly. The\r\nplan is perhaps unique in England, and comfort has been attained, though\r\none would hardly believe it, such size seeming to swamp everything except\r\nshow. The description of the house, as given by a visitor there, reads like\r\nthat of a palace: \"The hall is an octagonal room in the centre of the house\r\nabout seventy-five feet in length and from thirty to forty broad: on each\r\nside, at the end farthest from the entrance, are two doors leading into\r\nanterooms--one the ante-drawing-room, and the other the ante-dining-room;\r\neach is lighted by three large windows, and is thirty-three feet in length:\r\nthey are fine rooms in themselves, and well-proportioned. From these lead\r\nthe drawing-room and the dining-room respectively, both exceedingly grand\r\nrooms, ingenious in design and shape, each with two oriel windows and\r\nlighted by three others and a large bay window: this suite completes the\r\neast side. The south is occupied by the end of the drawing-room and a vast\r\nlibrary--all _en suite_. The library is lighted by four bay windows, three\r\nflat ones and a fine alcove, and the rest of the main building to the west\r\nis made up of billiard- and smoking-rooms, waiting-hall, groom-of-chambers'\r\nsitting- and bed-rooms, and a carpet-room, besides the necessary\r\nstaircases. This completes the main building, and a corridor leads to the\r\nkitchen and cook's offices: this corridor, which passes over the upper\r\npart of the kitchen, branches off into two parts--one leading to an\r\nexcellently-planned mansion for the family and the private secretary, and\r\nanother leading to the stables, which are arranged with great skill. The\r\npony stable, the carriage-horse stable, the riding horses, occupy different\r\nsides, and through these are arranged, just in the right places, the rooms\r\nfor livery and saddle grooms and coachmen. The laundry, wash-house,\r\ngun-room and game-larder occupy another building, which, however, is easily\r\napproached, and the whole building, though it extends seven hundred feet in\r\nlength, is a perfect model of compactness. Great facilities are given to\r\nany one who desires to see it.\" The mention of a \"mansion for the family\"\r\nshows how the associations of a home are lost in this wilderness of\r\nmagnificence: indeed, I remember a remark of a person whose husband had\r\nthree or four country-houses in England and Scotland and a house in London,\r\nthat \"she never felt at home anywhere.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHESTER CATHEDRAL AND CITY WALL.]\r\n\r\nThe farms in this neighborhood are mostly small, the average being seventy\r\nacres, and some are still smaller, though when one gets down to ten, one is\r\ntempted to call them gardens. Grazing and dairy-work are the chief\r\nindustries. Farther inland, beyond the manufacturing town of Stockport, is\r\na house of the Leghs, an immense building, more imposing than lovely in its\r\nexterior, but one of the most individual and pleasant houses in its\r\ninterior as well as in its human associations. It has been altered at\r\nvarious times, and bears traces, like a corrected map, of each new phase of\r\narchitecture for several hundred years. The four sides form a huge\r\nquadrangle, entered by foreign-looking gateways, and the rooms all open\r\ninto a wide passage that runs round three sides of the building, and is a\r\nmuseum in itself. Old and new are just enough blended to produce comfort,\r\nand the stately, old-English look of the drawing-room, with its dark\r\npanelling and tapestry, is a reproach to the pink-and-white,\r\nplaster-of-Paris style of too many remodelled houses. Outside there is a\r\ngarden distinguished by a heavy old wall overrun with creepers, dividing\r\ntwo levels and making a striking object in the landscape; and beyond that,\r\nwhere the country grows bleak and begins to remind one of moors, there are\r\nthe last survivors of a unique breed of wild cattle, which, like the\r\nmastiffs at the house, bear the name of the place. The name of another\r\nCheshire house, formerly belonging to the Stanleys, and now to Mr.\r\nGladstone, is probably familiar to American readers--Hawarden Castle. The\r\npresent house must trust entirely to associations for its interest, having\r\nbeen built in 1809, before much taste was applied to restore old places,\r\nbut the old castle in the park dates from the middle of the thirteenth\r\ncentury. The park is not unlike that of Arundel, but the views from the\r\nruin are finer and more varied. The counties of Caernarvon, Denbigh, Flint,\r\nCheshire and Lancashire are spread out around it, and the ruin itself is\r\nbeautiful and extensive.\r\n\r\nThe road from Hawarden to Boughton is exceedingly grand: we come upon one\r\nof the widest panoramas of the Dee and one of the most typical of English\r\ncountry scenes. A vast sweep of country unsurpassed in richness spreads\r\nalong the river on the Cheshire side: sixty square miles of fields and\r\npastures are in sight, with elms, sycamores and formal rows of Lombardy\r\npoplars. Wherever the trees cluster in a grove they usually mark the site\r\nof a country-house or a cherished ruin, like this one of old Hawarden,\r\nwhere one enormous oak tree sweeps its branches on the ground on every\r\nside, and forms a canopy whence you can peer out, as through the delicate\r\ntracery of a Gothic window, at the landscape beyond. The mouth of the Dee\r\nis visible from this road, whence at low water it seems reduced to a huge\r\nsandbank, through which the tired river trickles like a brook. The dun sky\r\nand yellow sands and gray sea, with the island of Hilbree, a counterpart of\r\nLindisfarne both in its legend of a recluse and its continual alternation\r\ntwice a day between the state of an island and a peninsula, make a picture\r\npleasant to look back upon. Hence too come the shoals of cockles and\r\nmussels that go to delight Londoners. Then the open-sea fishing, the lithe\r\nboats that seem all sail, the wide waste of waters, with the point of Air\r\nand the Great Orme's Head walling it in on the receding Welsh coasts, the\r\nremembrance of the shipwreck a little beyond the mouth of the Dee which led\r\nto Milton's poem of _Lycidas_ (containing the phrase \"wizard stream\" which\r\nhas become peculiar to the Dee),--all claim our notice, and it seems\r\nimpossible that we are so few miles from Manchester and so far from the\r\nhistoric, romantic times of old.\r\n\r\nLADY BLANCHE MURPHY.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OVERTON CHURCH.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOR ANOTHER.\r\n\r\n    Sweet--sweet?

From the Mediterranean on the north to the\r\nDjurjura range on the south, a distance of two hours' ride by rail if there\r\nwere a railway, the ascent is equal to that from New York Bay to the summit\r\nof Mount Washington. The palm is at home on the shore, while snow is\r\npreserved through the summer in the hollows of the peaks. This epitome of\r\nthe zones is more condensed than that so often remarked upon on the eastern\r\nslope of Mexico, although it does not embrace such extremes of temperature\r\nas those presented by Vera Cruz and the uppermost third of Orizaba. The\r\ncountry being more broken, the lower and higher levels are brought at many\r\npoints more closely together than on the Mexican ascent. It happens thus\r\nthat semi-tropical and semi-arctic plants come not simply into one and the\r\nsame landscape, but into actual contact. Each hill is a miniature Orizaba,\r\nso far as it rises, and hundreds of abrupt hills collected in a space\r\ncomparatively so limited so dovetail the floras of different levels as in a\r\ndegree to cause them to coalesce and effect a certain mutual adaptation of\r\nhabits. Good neighborhood has established itself rather more completely\r\namong the vegetable than with the human part of the inhabitants.\r\n\r\nWhat more amiable example of give-and-take than the intertwining of birch\r\nand orange, the thin ghostly sprays of the hyperborean caressing the\r\nfragrant leaf and golden globes of the sub-tropical? This, and other\r\nconjunctions less eloquent of contrast, may be seen on the headland of\r\nZeffoun or Cape Corbelin. They stand out from a prevailing background of\r\nthe familiar forest trees of temperate Europe and America--the ash, elm,\r\nbeech, oak, fir and walnut. The orchards, above those of oranges and\r\nlemons, are of figs and olives. The cork-oak covers considerable tracts,\r\nbut is less attended to than in Spain. A non-European aspect is imparted by\r\nthe tufts of cactus and aloes which abound in the most arid localities.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE DJURJURA RANGE.]\r\n\r\nWherever intelligent farming is met with in Northern Africa it is a safe\r\nassertion that the Kabyles are either on the spot or not far off. Like\r\nother farmers, they are conservative and adhere to old rules or fancies,\r\nwhich in some cases verge upon superstition. The practice of fertilizing\r\nfig trees by hanging them with fruits of the wild fig is one of those which\r\nit is difficult to class--whether with the visionary or the practical. Be\r\nthat as it may, people who know nothing about figs except to eat them have\r\nno right to a say in the matter. Tradition and experience are in favor of\r\nthe Kabyle. He does what has been done since Aristotle, Theophrastus and\r\nPliny, all of whom insist on \"caprification\" as essential to a large crop\r\nof figs adapted to drying. He will go or send many miles to procure the\r\nwild fruit if it does not grow in his neighborhood, and the traffic in it\r\nreaches a value of some thousands of dollars annually, trains of thirty,\r\nfifty and sixty mule-loads passing from one tribe to another. As with other\r\nvaluable things, this inedible fruit is food for quarrelling. The tribe\r\nwhich is rich in the _dokhar_, or wild fig, is fortunate, and especially so\r\nif its neighbors have none or if their crop of it fails. It is then able to\r\n\"bull the market,\" and proceeds to do so with a promptness and vim that\r\nwould turn a Wall street operator blue with envy. But it is compelled to\r\ntake account of troubles in its path unknown at the Board. The party who is\r\n\"short\" on dokhar may be \"long\" on matchlocks. If so, the speculation is\r\napt to come to an unhappy end. A sudden raid will capture the stock and at\r\nonce equalize the market. To many communities figs are at once meat and\r\npocket-money. To lose the harvest is not to be thought of. The aspect of\r\nthe means of preventing such a disaster is altogether a secondary\r\nconsideration. Dokhar at all hazards is the cry of men, women and children.\r\nThe comparative cessation of fig-wars is one of the blessings due to French\r\nrule.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROAD ACROSS THE DJURJURA AT MOUNT TIROURDA.]\r\n\r\nWhat we deem the fruit of the fig is, it will be remembered, only the husk,\r\nthe apparent seeds being the true fruit and--before ripening--the blossom.\r\nA small fly establishes itself in the interior of the wild fig, escaping in\r\ngreat numbers when the fruit is ripe. This happens before the ripening of\r\nthe improved fig, and the fly is supposed to carry the wild pollen to the\r\nflowers of the latter. A single insect, say the Kabyles, will perfect\r\nninety-nine figs, the hundredth becoming its tomb. Some varieties of figs\r\ndo not need caprification, but they are said to be unsuitable for drying or\r\nshipment.\r\n\r\nThe Italian practice of touching the eye of each fig, while yet on the\r\ntree, with a drop of olive oil seems opposed to the African plan; since the\r\noil would certainly exclude the insect. And there are no better figs in the\r\nworld than those of the Southern States of the Union, which are not\r\ntreated in either way, and receive the least possible cultivation of any\r\nkind. Those States, if it be true that the difference in the yield of a\r\n\"caprified\" and non-caprified tree is that between two hundred and eighty\r\nand twenty-five pounds, cannot do better than borrow a leaf from the Kabyle\r\nbook, should it only be a fig-leaf to aid in clothing the nakedness of bare\r\nsands and galled hillsides. The United States Department of Agriculture\r\nshould by all means introduce the dokhar. Some of our agricultural\r\nmachinery would be an exchange in the highest degree beneficial to the\r\nother side.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE PEAK OF TIROURDA.]\r\n\r\nLong before the French occupation the Kabyles had maintained a regulation\r\nwhich is, we believe, peculiar in Europe to France--the _ban_, or\r\nlegally-established day for the beginning of the vintage and the harvest of\r\nother fruits. The cultivator may repose under his own vine and fig tree,\r\nbut he shall not until the word is given by the proper authority put forth\r\nhis hand to pluck its luscious boon, though perfectly mature or past\r\nmaturity. Exceptions are made in case of invalids and distinguished guests,\r\nand doubtless the hale schoolboy decrees an occasional dispensation in his\r\nown favor. The birds share his defiance of the law, and both are abetted by\r\na third group of transgressors, the monkeys.\r\n\r\nAfricans of this last-named race are in some localities extremely numerous,\r\nand they do not restrict their foraging parties to succulent food. Grain\r\nis very acceptable to them, and has the advantage of keeping better than\r\nfruit, the art of drying which they have not yet mastered any more than the\r\nBushmen or the Pi-Utes. They establish granaries in the crevices of the\r\nrocks; and these reserves of provision are sometimes of such magnitude as\r\nto make exploring expeditions on the part of the plundered Kabyles quite\r\nremunerative.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DJEMA-SAHRIDJ.]\r\n\r\nThese most ancient of all the devastators which have successively descended\r\nupon Barbary are baboons of small size. They have no tails, that ancestral\r\norgan having dwindled to a wart the size of a pea. This approach to the\r\nform of man is aided by another point of personal resemblance--long\r\nwhiskers. That the tail should have been worn off against the rocks, or in\r\nclimbing the fences to get at orchards and melon-patches, is easily\r\nconceivable. How the evolutionists account for the retention of the beard\r\ndoes not yet appear. The females carry their young as adroitly and\r\ncarefully as do the Kabyle women, and ascend the rocks with them with much\r\ngreater activity. A young monkey has a less neglected look than a young\r\nKabyle. His ablutions cannot be less frequent. Tourists complain that all\r\nKabylia does not boast a single bath-house--a privation the more striking\r\nto one who has to pick his way often for miles among the ruins of Roman\r\naqueducts, tanks and baths, the great basin in cut stone at Djema-Sahridj,\r\nwhich gives name to the place, being a noted example of these works.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A DISH-FACTORY.]\r\n\r\nAs the vultures, dogs, negroes, Jews and jackals keep exact memoranda of\r\nthe market-days, so the baboons are always on hand at harvest. Ranged in\r\nlong ranks on an amphitheatre of cliffs, stroking gravely their long white\r\nbeards like so many reverend _episcopi_ or \"on-lookers\" confident of their\r\ntithes, they calmly contemplate the toilers in the vale below. Swift was\r\nnot more certain of his \"tithe-pig and mortuary guinea.\" Sunset comes\r\nsooner below than above. The reapers are early home, and the peaks are\r\nstill purple when the marauders pour down upon the fields, and their share\r\nof the work is done with a neatness unsurpassable by reiver, ritter or\r\nkateran. The monkey-tax thus collected is quite a calculable percentage of\r\nthe crop, and few taxes are more regularly paid. As it goes to\r\nnon-producers, its reduction is an object constantly kept in view. The\r\nwretched guns of the natives are, however, but a feeble instrument of\r\nreform. The chassepot may succeed after having finished the rest of its\r\ntask, and dispose of the baboons after the settlement of the men. The\r\nformer, though not incomparably smaller than the French conscript after a\r\nprotracted war, will never be made to bear arms. He is therefore useless to\r\nmodern statesmen, and needs to be got rid of.\r\n\r\nWhile the barn is defrauded by these little vegetarians, the barnyard is\r\nlaid under tribute by a family of equally unauthorized flesh-eaters--the\r\npanthers. If this large spotted cat, known in other parts of the world as\r\nounce, jaguar, leopard and chetah, has any choice of diet, it is for veal.\r\nBut his appreciation of kid is none the less lively. Lamb, in season, comes\r\nwell to him also. As there are many panthers, each of them of \"unbounded\r\nstomach,\" and they can find little to eat in the way of wild quadrupeds,\r\nthe destruction they must cause among domestic animals is seen to be\r\nserious. In the Mokuéa neighborhood each village has its panther-killer, an\r\nenterprising man set apart for a profession which sometimes becomes\r\nhereditary. One of these boasts of having killed thirty-six panthers. His\r\nfather before him had bagged seventy-five, and he hoped before pulling his\r\nfinal trigger to have done as well. This expectation was a just one, as at\r\ntwenty-eight he had already nearly halved the paternal count. The method of\r\nhunting is very simple. The sportsman fixes a bleating little victim from\r\nthe herd at the foot of a tree, and climbs with his flint gun into the\r\nbranches. Had the North African beast the arboreal habits of the South\r\nAfrican tree-leopard or the American jaguar, this proceeding would be less\r\neffectual with him. But he can neither climb nor reflect like his\r\ncountryman the monkey, and is picked off like a beef. One finds it\r\ndifficult to get up sympathy for an animal so little able to take care of\r\nhimself, or to suppose that panthers could have furnished a particularly\r\nhigh-spiced ingredient to the enjoyments of the Roman arena. An English\r\nbull-dog, if less picturesque, would have been far more fruitful of\r\nfighting.\r\n\r\nProducts edible neither to the wild beast nor the tooth of time are the\r\nKabyle vases in clay. The amphoræ in common use by the women for carrying\r\nwater are generally of graceful forms, comparing well in design with many\r\nof the archaic vases of Greece and the Levant. The patterns vary somewhat\r\nwith the locality, but there is a resemblance which speaks of a common\r\norigin and taste. Those of the Beni-Raten all come to a blunt point at the\r\nbottom, and will not stand unsupported. The jar is made to rest upon the\r\ngirdle of the bearer, while she supports it upon her back by one or both of\r\nthe handles. Among the tribes nearer the Djurjura the jar has a broader and\r\nhollowed bottom, fitted to rest upon the head of the woman. It must\r\ntherefore be less elongated and more rotund to admit of her reaching the\r\nhandles for the purpose of balancing it. These jars weigh, filled with\r\nwater, sixty pounds. In carrying one of them a Kabyle woman, it may easily\r\nbe supposed, is not in a condition to study lightness of step or grace of\r\ncarriage. Yet this heavy task, to which she begins to accustom herself at\r\nthe age of twelve, does not appear to injure her figure or health. Such a\r\nresult is more often due to violent and exceptional strains than to\r\nhabitual exertion even greater in extent. The muscles are not less\r\nsusceptible of education than the mind. Whatever brings out the full power\r\nof either without suddenly overtasking is healthy and beneficial.\r\n\r\nIt has been remarked that the most usual size of the Kabyle water-jar is as\r\nnearly as possible identical with the amphora kept for a standard measure\r\nin the Capitol at Rome. This coincidence may well be due rather to a\r\ncorrespondence in the average strength of the carriers than to a common\r\nsystem of authorized measures. In decoration the Kabyle vases approach the\r\nArabic more than the Roman style. But the feeling, both in form and\r\ncoloring, is decidedly more artistic than in the similar ware of Northern\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nVery ancient influences are manifest, too, in the work of the Kabyle\r\nsilversmiths. Their diadems, ear-drops, bracelets and anklets remind one\r\nof the forms unearthed at Hissarlik and in Cyprus. In outline and chasing\r\nthe rectangular, mathematical and monumental rules at the expense of the\r\nflowing and floriated. A certain pre-Phidian stiffness of handling seems to\r\nhamper the workman, as though twenty-three hundred years had been lost for\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE BOUDOIR AND KITCHEN.]\r\n\r\nThat there should be so much of hopeful force left in the Kabyle, artisan,\r\nagriculturist or adventurer, is creditable to him, and suggests \"an\r\noriginal glory not yet lost.\" He obstinately refuses to accept the sheer\r\nprofessional vagabondism of the Arab, confident, as it were, that the world\r\nhas in reserve better use for him than that. \"Day-dawn in Africa\" will\r\nprobably gild his hills sooner than the tufted swamps of Guinea or the\r\nslimy huts of the Nile. A class of missionaries quite different from the\r\nLivingstones and the Moffatts have devoted themselves to his improvement.\r\nThey approach him in a different way, and begin on his commercial and\r\nindustrial side, not on the spiritual. The latter does not appear to be by\r\nany means so accessible. Unlike the Ashantees, the Kafirs and the M'pongwe,\r\nhe was a Christian once, and may become one again. But he is not going to\r\nbe evangelized on the hurrah system; and that fact his new rulers, with all\r\ntheir alleged defects as reformers and colonizers, have sense enough to\r\nrecognize. The new faith must push its way in the rear of works. Peace,\r\ngood government, good roads, better implements and methods of labor will\r\npromote the enlightenment necessary to its success.\r\n\r\nBougie, the port of Eastern Kabylia, lying under Cape Carbon, has one\r\nCatholic church, standing in the midst of new streets, squares and public\r\nconstructions indicative of prosperity wrought by the French régime. It is\r\nstill in need of easy communication with the interior, having but one\r\nroad--one more than in the time of the Turks. Wax is the chief commodity\r\ntraversing that line of traffic. That circumstance has, however, nothing to\r\ndo with the name of the town. The name was there when the French came, as\r\nwas the wax, and very little else but ruins. If the present state of\r\nimprovement has been effected with so little aid from good roads, what\r\nwould not a number of them accomplish? A railway running to the other end\r\nof the province longitudinally through its centre would have but one ridge\r\nto overcome, and would find a very fair business ready for it. The railway\r\nand vandalism, in the proverbial sense of the word, could not coexist.\r\nWhen the Vandals buy railway-tickets and ship fat oxen on fast stock-trains\r\nthe African world will move. Nobody ever heard of chronic war between two\r\nadjacent railroad-stations, or of a gang of raiders dressed only in shirts\r\nand armed with spears and matchlocks going out on the morning mail for a\r\nday's shooting among their fellow-countrymen in the next county.\r\n\r\nLet us quote a sketch of the region lying a few leagues west and north-west\r\nof Bougie:\r\n\r\n\"Near Tarourt we found thermal springs. An open park-like country,\r\nbeautiful with trees and turf, is defaced only by charred spots where the\r\ncork-woods have been burned by the natives to effect clearings much less in\r\nextent than the space thus denuded. Ten acres of cork trees will be\r\nthoughtlessly burned to make one of fig-orchard. And this evil rather\r\nincreases than lessens, prevention being difficult by reason of the want of\r\ngood roads for reaching the delinquents.... In six hours' march we reached\r\nToudja, at the foot of Mount Arbalon, in the most delicious oasis\r\nimaginable. The soil, threaded by clear and cool rivulets which spring in\r\nabundance from the rocks forming the base of the mountain, is wonderfully\r\nfertile. We are surrounded by more than a square league of tufted verdure,\r\ncomposed in great part of orange and lemon groves, mingled with some palms\r\nand immense carob trees. The houses are well built, and even show fancy in\r\ntheir designs. Vines bending with enormous clusters of grapes festoon\r\nthemselves from tree to tree, tasselling the topmost branches with fruit\r\nand tendrils. It is not uncommon to see four or five large trees taken\r\npossession of by a single vine, its trunk as large as the body of a man.\r\nThe grapes are mostly of a light-red color, large and sweet.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: REPOSE.]\r\n\r\nAll this indicates that France did not deceive herself as to the\r\ncapabilities of Algeria, and that her conquest of it was inspired by\r\nconsiderations more solid than the glory she has been accused of\r\nrecognizing as an all-sufficient motive. She has made the country much\r\nmore valuable to the commerce of the world than any other part of Barbary.\r\nHad she done nothing more with it than hold it prostrate and put an end to\r\nits existence as a den of pirates, she would by that alone have earned the\r\ngratitude of the nations. She has done a great deal more. European\r\ncivilization has discovered a penetrable spot in the dense armor of\r\nAfrican barbarism. It has effected a lodgment in the darkest and most\r\nhopeless of the continents. Should the movement fail, like so many before\r\nit, to extend itself, and become localized after a period of promise, the\r\ncause must be sought mainly in natural obstacles almost impossible to be\r\novercome.\r\n\r\nTo have lifted the dead, brutal weight of Ottoman tyranny from any corner\r\nof the broad territory it blasts is to deserve well of humanity. Still\r\nstronger is the case when the rescued territory is fertile, beautiful, and\r\ninhabited by a race worthy of a better fate than the bondage against which\r\nit had never ceased to struggle.\r\n\r\nFrance has not been guiltless of acts of severity, always attendant, in a\r\ngreater or less degree, on violent political changes. It is not doubtful,\r\nnevertheless, that by repressing the endless turbulence of the tribes and\r\ndriving out a foreign rule that knew no law but force, she has saved many\r\nmore lives than she has taken. A genius for organization was never denied\r\nher. Organization was the first thing wanted in Algeria.\r\n\r\nEDWARD C. BRUCE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"FOR PERCIVAL.\"\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nTHORNS AND ROSES.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was a long, narrow and rather low room, with four windows looking out on\r\na terrace. Jasmine and roses clustered round them, and flowers lifted their\r\nheads to the broad sills. Within, the lighted candles showed furniture that\r\nwas perhaps a little faded and dim, though it had a slender, old-fashioned\r\ngrace which more than made amends for any beauty it had lost. There was\r\nmuch old china, and on the walls were a few family portraits, of which\r\ntheir owner was justly proud; and in the air there lingered a faint\r\nfragrance of dried rose-leaves, delicate yet unconquerable. Even the full\r\ntide of midsummer sweetness which flowed through the open windows could not\r\naltogether overcome that subtle memory of summers long gone by.\r\n\r\nThe master of the house, with a face like a wrinkled waxen mask, sat in his\r\neasy-chair reading the _Saturday Review_, and a lady very like him, only\r\nwith a little more color and fulness, was knitting close by. The light\r\nshone on the old man's pale face and white hair, on the old lady's\r\nsilver-gray dress and flashing rings: the knitting-pins clicked, working up\r\nthe crimson wool, and the pages of the paper rustled with a pleasant\r\ncrispness as they were turned. By the window, where the candlelight faded\r\ninto the soft shadows, stood a young man apparently lost in thought. His\r\nface, which was turned a little toward the garden, was a noteworthy one\r\nwith its straight forehead and clearly marked, level brows. His features\r\nwere good, and his clear olive complexion gave him something of a foreign\r\nair. He had no beard, and his moustache was only a dark shadow on his upper\r\nlip, so that his mouth stood revealed as one which indicated reserve,\r\nthough it was neither stern nor thin-lipped. Altogether, it was a pleasant\r\nface.\r\n\r\nA light step sauntering along the terrace, a low voice softly singing\r\n\"Drink to Me only with Thine Eyes,\" roused him from his reverie. He did not\r\nmove, but his mouth and eyes relaxed into a smile as a white figure came\r\nout of the dusk exactly opposite his window, and singer and song stopped\r\ntogether. \"Oh, Percival! I didn't know you had come out of the\r\ndining-room.\"\r\n\r\n\"Twenty minutes ago. What have you been doing?\"\r\n\r\n\"Wandering about the garden. What could I do on such a perfect night but\r\nwhat I have been doing all this perfect day?\"\r\n\r\nShe stood looking up at him as she spoke. She had an arch, beautiful\r\nface--the sort of face which would look well with patches and powder. Only\r\nit would have been a sin to powder the hair, which, though deep brown, had\r\nrich touches of gold, as if a happy sunbeam were imprisoned in its waves.\r\nHer eyes were dark, her lips were softly red: everything about Sissy\r\nLangton's face was delicate and fine. She lifted her hand to reach a spray\r\nof jasmine just above her head, and the lace sleeve above fell back from\r\nher pretty, slender wrist: \"Give it to me. Percival! do you hear? Oh, what\r\na tease you are!\" For he drew it back when she would have gathered it. Mrs.\r\nMiddleton was heard making a remark inside.\r\n\r\n\"You don't deserve it,\" said Percival. \"Here is my aunt saying that the hot\r\nweather makes you scandalously idle.\"\r\n\r\n\"Scandalously idle! Aunt Harriet!\" Sissy repeated it in incredulous\r\namusement, and the old lady's indignant disclaimer was heard: \"Percival!\r\nMost unusually idle, I said.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! most unusually idle? I beg your pardon. But doesn't that imply a\r\nconsiderable amount of idleness to be got through by one person?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but you helped me,\" said Sissy.--\"Aunt Harriet, listen. He stood on\r\nmy thimble ever so long while he was talking this afternoon. How can I work\r\nwithout a thimble?\"\r\n\r\n\"Impossible!\" said Percival. \"And I don't think I can get you another\r\nto-morrow: I am going out. On Thursday I shall come back and bring you one\r\nthat won't fit. Friday you must go with me to change it. Yes, we shall\r\nmanage three days' holiday very nicely.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense! But it _is_ your fault if I am idle.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, yes. Having no thimble, you are naturally unable to finish your book,\r\nfor instance.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I sha'n't finish that: I don't like it. The heroine is so dreadfully\r\nstrong-minded I don't believe in her. She never does anything wrong; and\r\nthough she suffers tortures--absolute agony, you know--she always rises to\r\nthe occasion--nasty thing!\"\r\n\r\n\"A wonderful woman,\" said Percival, idly picking sprays of jasmine as he\r\nspoke.\r\n\r\nSissy's voice sank lower: \"Do you think there are really any women like\r\nthat?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes, I suppose so.\"\r\n\r\nShe took the flowers which he held out, and looked doubtfully into his\r\nface: \"But--do you _like_ them, Percival?\"\r\n\r\n\"Make the question a little clearer,\" he said. \"I don't like your ranting,\r\npushing, unwomanly women who can talk of nothing but their rights. They are\r\nvery terrible. But heroic women--\" He stopped short. The pause was more\r\neloquent than speech.\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" said Sissy, \"Well--a woman like Jael? or Judith?\"\r\n\r\nHe repeated the name \"Judith.\" \"Or Charlotte Corday?\" he suggested after a\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\nIt was Sissy's turn to hesitate, and she compressed her pretty lips\r\ndoubtfully. Being in the Old Testament, Jael must of course come out all\r\nright, even if one finds it difficult to like her. Judith's position, is\r\nless clear. Still, it is a great thing to be in the Apocrypha, and then\r\nliving so long ago and so far away makes a difference. But Charlotte\r\nCorday--a young Frenchwoman, not a century dead, who murdered a man, and\r\nwas guillotined in those horrible revolutionary times,--would Percival say\r\n_that_ was the type of woman he liked?\r\n\r\n\"Well--Charlotte Corday, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I admire her,\" he said slowly. \"Though I would rather the heroism did\r\nnot show itself in bloodshed. Still, she was noble: I honor her. I dare say\r\nthe others were too, but I don't know so much about them.\"\r\n\r\n\"What a poor little thing you must think me!\" said Sissy. \"I could never do\r\nanything heroic.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\"\r\n\r\n\"I should be frightened. I can't bear people to be angry with me. I should\r\nrun away, or do something silly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I hope you won't be tried,\" said Percival.\r\n\r\nShe shook her pretty head: \"People always talk about casting gold into the\r\nfurnace, and it's coming out only the brighter and better. Things are not\r\ngood for much if you would rather they were not tried.\"\r\n\r\nHer hand was on the window-frame as she spoke, and the young man touched a\r\nring she wore: \"Gold is tried in the furnace--yes, but not your pearls.\r\nBesides, I'm not so sure that you would fail if you were put to the test.\"\r\n\r\nShe smiled, well pleased, yet unconvinced.\r\n\r\n\"You think,\" he went on, \"that people who did great deeds did them without\r\nan effort--were always ready, like a bow always strung? No, no, Sissy: they\r\nfelt very weak sometimes. Isn't there anything in the world you think you\r\ncould die for? Even if you say 'No' now, there may be something one of\r\nthese days.\"\r\n\r\nThe twilight hid the soft glow which overspread her face. \"Anything in the\r\nworld you could die for?\" Anything? Anybody? Her blood flowed in a strong,\r\ncourageous current as her heart made answer, \"Yes--for one.\"\r\n\r\nBut she did not speak, and after a moment her companion changed the\r\nsubject. \"That's a pretty ring,\" he said.\r\n\r\nSissy started from her reverie: \"Horace gave it me. Adieu, Mr. Percival\r\nThorne: I'm going to look at my roses.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you. Yes, I shall be delighted to come.\" And Percival jumped out.\r\n\"Don't look at me as if I'd said something foolish. Isn't that the right\r\nway to answer your kind invitation?\"\r\n\r\n\"Invitation! What next?\" demanded Sissy with pretty scorn. And the pair\r\nwent off together along the terrace and into the fragrant dusk.\r\n\r\nA minute later it occurred to Mrs. Middleton to fear that Sissy might take\r\ncold, and she went to the window to look after her. But, as no one was to\r\nbe seen, she turned away and encountered her brother, who had been watching\r\nthem too. \"Do they care for each other?\" he asked abruptly.\r\n\r\n\"How can I tell?\" Mrs. Middleton replied. \"Of course she is fond of him in\r\na way, but I can't help fancying sometimes that Horace--\"\r\n\r\n\"Horace!\" Mr. Thorne's smile was singularly bland. \"Oh, indeed! Horace--a\r\ncharming arrangement! Pray how many more times is Mr. Horace to supplant\r\nthat poor boy?\" His soft voice changed suddenly, as one might draw a sword\r\nfrom its sheath. \"Horace had better not cross Percival's path, or he will\r\nhave to deal with me. Is he not content? What next must he have?\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Middleton paused. She could have answered him. There was an obvious\r\nreply, but it was too crushing to be used, and Mr. Thorne braved it\r\naccordingly.\r\n\r\n\"Better leave your grandsons alone, Godfrey,\" she said at last, \"if you'll\r\ntake my advice; which I don't think you ever did yet. You'll only make\r\nmischief. And there is Sissy to be considered. Let the child choose for\r\nherself.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you think she can choose--_Horace?_\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\"\r\n\r\n\"Choose Horace rather than Percival?\"\r\n\r\n\"I should,\" said the old lady with smiling audacity. \"And I would rather\r\nshe did. Horace's position is better.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Thorne uttered something akin to a grunt, which might by courtesy be\r\ntaken for a groan: \"Oh, how mercenary you women are! Well, if you marry a\r\nman for his money, Horace has the best of it--if he behaves himself. Yes, I\r\nadmit that--_if he behaves himself_\"'\r\n\r\n\"And Horace is handsomer,\" said Mrs. Middleton with a smile.\r\n\r\n\"Pink-and-white prettiness!\" scoffed Mr. Thorne.\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense!\" The color mounted to the old lady's forehead, and she spoke\r\nsharply: \"We didn't hear anything about that when he was a lad, and we were\r\nafraid of something amiss with his lungs: it would have been high treason\r\nto say a syllable against him then. And now, though I suppose he will\r\nalways be a little delicate (you'd be sorry if you lost him, Godfrey), it's\r\na shame to talk as if the boys were not to be compared. They are just of a\r\nheight, not half an inch difference, and the one as brave and manly as the\r\nother. Horace is fair, and Percival is dark; and you know, as well as I do,\r\nthat Horace is the handsomer.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Thorne shifted his ground: \"If I were Sissy I would choose my husband\r\nfor qualities that are rather more than skin-deep.\"\r\n\r\n\"By all means. And still I would choose Horace.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is amiss with Percival?\"\r\n\r\n\"He is not so frank and open. I don't want to say anything against him--I\r\nlike Percival--but I wish he were not quite so reserved.\"\r\n\r\n\"What next?\" said Mr. Thorne with a short laugh. \"Why, only this morning\r\nyou said he talked more than Horace.\"\r\n\r\n\"Talked? Oh yes, Percival can talk, and about himself too,\" said Mrs.\r\nMiddleton with a smile. \"But he can keep his secrets all the time. I don't\r\nwant to say anything against him: I like him very much--\"\r\n\r\n\"No doubt,\" said Mr. Thorne.\r\n\r\n\"But I don't feel quite sure that I know him. He isn't like Horace. You\r\nknow Horace's friends--\"\r\n\r\n\"Trust me for that.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what do you know of Percival's? I heard him tell Sissy he would be out\r\nto-morrow. Will you ever know where he went?\"\r\n\r\n\"I sha'n't ask him.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" she retorted, \"you dare not! Isn't it a rule that no one is ever to\r\nquestion Percival?\"\r\n\r\n\"And while I'm master here it shall be obeyed. It's the least I can do. The\r\nboy shall come and go, speak or hold his tongue, as he pleases. No one\r\nshall cross him--Horace least of all--while I'm master here, Harriet; but\r\nthat won't be very long.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't want you to think any harm of Percival's silence,\" she answered\r\ngently. \"I don't for one moment suppose he has any secrets to be ashamed\r\nof. I myself like people to be open, that is all.\"\r\n\r\n\"If I wanted to know anything Percival would tell me,\" said Mr. Thorne.\r\n\r\nMrs. Middleton's charity was great. She hid the smile she could not\r\nrepress. \"Well,\" she said, \"perhaps I am not fair to Percival, but,\r\nGodfrey, you are not quite just to Horace.\"\r\n\r\nHe turned upon her: \"Unjust to Horace? _I?_\"\r\n\r\nShe knew what he meant. He had shown Horace signal favor, far above his\r\ncousin, yet what she had said was true. Perhaps some of the injustice had\r\nbeen in this very favor. \"Here are our truants!\" she exclaimed. She and her\r\nbrother had not talked so confidentially for years, but the moment her eyes\r\nfell on Sissy her thoughts went back to the point at which Mr. Thorne had\r\ndisturbed them: \"My dearest Sissy, I am so afraid you will catch cold.\"\r\n\r\n\"It can't be done to-night,\" said Percival. \"Won't you come and try?\" But\r\nthe old lady shook her head.\r\n\r\n\"All right, auntie! we won't stop out,\" said Sissy; and a moment later she\r\nmade her appearance in the drawing-room with her hands full of roses, which\r\nshe tossed carelessly on the table. Mr. Thorne had picked up his paper, and\r\nstood turning the pages and pretending to read, but she pushed it aside to\r\nput a rosebud in his coat.\r\n\r\n\"Roses are more fit for you young people than for an old fellow like me,\"\r\nhe said, \"Why don't you give one to Percival?\"\r\n\r\nShe looked over her shoulder at young Thorne. \"Do you want one?\" she said.\r\n\r\nHe smiled, with a slight movement of his head and his dark eyes fixed on\r\nhers.\r\n\r\n\"Then, why didn't you pick one when we were out? Now, weren't you foolish?\r\nWell, never mind. What color?\"\r\n\r\n\"Choose for him,\" said Mr. Thorne.\r\n\r\nSissy hesitated, looking from Percival's face to a bud of deepest crimson.\r\nThen, throwing it down, \"No, you shall have yellow,\" she exclaimed: \"Laura\r\nFalconer's complexion is something like yours, and she always wears yellow.\r\nAs soon as one yellow dress is worn out she gets another.\"\r\n\r\n\"She is a most remarkable young woman if she waits till the first one is\r\nworn out,\" said Percival.\r\n\r\n\"Am I to put your rose in or not?\" Sissy demanded.\r\n\r\nHe stepped forward with a smile, and looked darkly handsome as he stood\r\nthere with Sissy putting the yellow rose in his coat and glancing archly up\r\nat him.\r\n\r\nMr. Thorne from behind his _Saturday Review_ watched the girl who might,\r\nperhaps, hold his favorite's future in her hands. \"Does he care for her?\"\r\nhe wondered. If he did, the old man felt that he would gladly have knelt to\r\nentreat her, \"Be good to my poor Percival.\" But did Percival want her to be\r\ngood to him? Godfrey Thorne was altogether in the dark about his grandson's\r\nwishes in the matter. He tried hard not to think that he was in the dark\r\nabout every wish or hope of Percival's, and he looked up eagerly when the\r\nlatter said something about going out the next day. He remembered which\r\nhorse Percival liked, he assented to everything, but he watched him all the\r\ntime with a wistful curiosity. He did not really care where Percival went,\r\nbut he would have given much for such a word about his plans as would have\r\nproved to Harriet, and to himself too, that his boy _did_ confide in him\r\nsometimes. It was not to be, however. Young Thorne had taken up the local\r\npaper and the subject dropped. Mr. Thorne may have guessed later, but he\r\nnever knew where his roan horse went the next day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n\"THOSE EYES OF YOURS.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nNot five miles away that same evening a conversation was going on which\r\nwould have interested Mrs. Middleton.\r\n\r\nThe scene was an up-stairs room in a pleasant house near the county town.\r\nMrs. Blake, a woman of seven or eight and forty, handsome and well\r\npreserved, but of a high-colored type, leant back in an easy-chair lazily\r\nunfastening her bracelets, by way of signifying that she had begun to\r\nprepare for the night. Her two daughters were with her. Addie, the elder,\r\nwas at the looking-glass brushing her hair and half enveloped in its silky\r\nblackness. She was a tall, graceful girl, a refined likeness of her mother.\r\nOn the rug lay Lottie, three years younger, hardly more than a growing\r\ngirl, long-limbed, slight, a little abrupt and angular by her sister's\r\nside, her features not quite so regular, her face paler in its cloud of\r\ndark hair. Yet there was a look of determination and power which was\r\nwanting in Addie; and at times, when Lottie was roused, her eyes had a dark\r\nsplendor which made her sister's beauty seem comparatively commonplace and\r\ntame.\r\n\r\nStretched at full length, she propped her chin on her hands and looked up\r\nat her mother. \"I don't suppose you care,\" she said, in a clear, almost\r\nboyish voice.\r\n\r\n\"Not much,\" Mrs. Blake replied with, a smile. \"Especially as I rather doubt\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\nAddie paused, brush in hand: \"I really think you've made a mistake,\r\nLottie.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you really? I haven't, though,\" said that young lady decidedly.\r\n\r\n\"It can't be--surely,\" Addie hesitated, with a little shadow on her face.\r\n\r\n\"Of course no. Is it likely?\" said Mrs. Blake, as if the discussion were\r\nclosed.\r\n\r\n\"I tell you,\" said Lottie stubbornly, \"Godfrey Hammond told me that\r\nPercival's father was the eldest son.\"\r\n\r\n\"But it is Horace who has always lived at Brackenhill. Percival only goes\r\non a visit now and then. Every one knows,\" said Addie, in almost an injured\r\ntone, \"that Horace is the heir.\"\r\n\r\nLottie raised her head a little and eyed her sister intently, with\r\namusement, wonder, and a little scorn in her glance. Addie, blissfully\r\nunconscious, went on brushing her hair, still with that look of anxious\r\nperplexity.\r\n\r\n\"This is how it was,\" Lottie exclaimed suddenly. \"Percival was just gone,\r\nand you were talking to Horace. Up comes Godfrey Hammond, sits down by me,\r\nand says some rubbish about consoling me. I think I laughed. Then he looked\r\nat me out of his little, light eyes, and said that you and I seemed to get\r\non well with his young friends. So I said, 'Oh yes--middling.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Upon my word,\" smiled Mrs. Blake, \"you appear to have distinguished\r\nyourself in the conversation.\"\r\n\r\n\"Didn't I?\" said Lottie, untroubled and unabashed: \"I know it struck me so\r\nat the time. Then he said something--I forget how he put it--about our\r\nbeing just the right number and pairing off charmingly. So I said, 'Oh, of\r\ncourse the elder ones went together: that was only right.'\"\r\n\r\n\"And what did he say?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, he pinched his lips together and smiled, and said, 'Don't you know\r\nthat Percival is the elder?'\"\r\n\r\n\"But, Lottie, that proves nothing as to his father.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who supposed it did? I said 'Fiddlededee! I didn't mean that: I supposed\r\nthey were much about the same age, or if Percy were a month or two older it\r\nmade no difference. I meant that Horace was the eldest son's son, so of\r\ncourse he was A 1.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Well?\" said Addie.\r\n\r\n\"Well, then he looked twice as pleased with himself as he did before, and\r\nsaid, 'I don't think Horace told you that. It so happens that Percival is\r\nnot only the elder by a month or two, as you say, but he is the son of the\r\neldest son.' Then I said 'Oh!' and mamma called me for something, and I\r\nwent.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Blake and Addie exchanged glances.\r\n\r\n\"Now, could I have made a mistake?\" demanded Lottie.\r\n\r\n\"It seems plain enough, certainly,\" her mother allowed.\r\n\r\n\"Then, could Godfrey Hammond have made a mistake? Hasn't he known the\r\nThornes all their lives? and didn't he say once that he was named Godfrey\r\nafter their old grandfather?\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Blake assented.\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" said the girl, relapsing into her recumbent position, \"perhaps\r\nyou'll believe me another time.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps,\" said Mrs. Blake: \"we'll see when the other time comes. If it is\r\nas you say, it is curious.\" She rose as she spoke and went to the farther\r\nend of the room. As she stood by an open drawer putting away the ornaments\r\nwhich she had taken off, the candlelight revealed a shadow of perplexity\r\non her face which increased the likeness between herself and Addie.\r\nApparently, Lottie was right as to her facts. The estate was not entailed,\r\nthen, and despotic power seemed to be rather capriciously exercised by the\r\nhead of the house. If Horace should displease his grandfather--if, for\r\ninstance, he chose a wife of whom old Mr. Thorne did not approve--would his\r\nposition be very secure? Mrs. Blake was uneasy, and felt that it was very\r\nwrong of people to play tricks with the succession to an estate like\r\nBrackenhill.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Lottie watched her sister, who was thoughtfully drawing her\r\nfingers through her long hair. \"Addie,\" she said, after a pause, \"what will\r\nyou do if Horace isn't the heir after all?\"\r\n\r\n\"What a silly question! I shan't do anything: there's nothing for me to\r\ndo.\"\r\n\r\n\"But shall you mind very much? You are very fond of Horace, aren't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Fond of him!\" Addie repeated. \"He is very pleasant to talk to, if you mean\r\nthat.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you can't deceive me so! I believe that you are in love with him,\"\r\nsaid Lottie solemnly.\r\n\r\nThe color rushed to Addie's face when her vaguely tender sentiments,\r\nindefinite as Horace's attentions, were described in this startling\r\nfashion. \"Indeed, I'm nothing of the kind,\" she said hurriedly. \"Pray don't\r\ntalk such utter nonsense, Lottie. If you have nothing more sensible to say,\r\nyou had better hold your tongue.\"\r\n\r\n\"But why are you ashamed of it?\" Lottie persisted: \"I wouldn't be.\" She had\r\nan unsuspected secret herself, but she would have owned it proudly enough\r\nhad she been challenged.\r\n\r\n\"I'm not ashamed,\" said Addie; \"and you know nothing about being in love,\r\nso you had better not talk about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes, I do!\" was the reply, uttered with Lottie's calm simplicity of\r\nmanner: \"I know how to tell whether you are in love or not, Addie. What\r\nwould you do if a girl were to win Horace Thorne away from you?\"\r\n\r\nPride and a sense of propriety dictated Addie's answer and gave sharpness\r\nto her voice: \"I should say she was perfectly welcome to him.\"\r\n\r\nLottie considered for a moment: \"Yes, I suppose one might _say_ so to her,\r\nbut what would you do? Wouldn't you want to kill her? And wouldn't you die\r\nof a broken heart?\"\r\n\r\nAddie was horrified: \"I don't want to kill anybody, and I'm not going to\r\ndie for Mr. Horace Thorne. Please don't say such things, Lottie: people\r\nnever do. You forget he is only an acquaintance.\"\r\n\r\n\"No; I don't think you are in love with him, certainly.\" Lottie pronounced\r\nthis decision with the air of one who has solved a difficult problem.\r\n\r\n\"What are you talking about?\" Mrs. Blake inquired, coming back, and\r\nglancing from Addie's flushed and troubled face to Lottie's thoughtful\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n\"I was asking Addie if she didn't want Horace to be the heir. I know you\r\ndo, mamma--oh, just for his own sake, because you think he's the nicest,\r\ndon't you? I heard you tell him one day \"--here Lottie looked up with a\r\ncandid gaze and audaciously imitated Mrs. Blake's manner--\"that though we\r\nknew his cousin _first_, he--Horace, you know--seemed to drop _so_\r\nnaturally into _all_ our ways that it was quite _delightful_ to feel that\r\nwe needn't stand on _any_ ceremony with him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good gracious, Lottie! what do you mean by listening to every word I say?\"\r\n\r\n\"I didn't listen--I heard,\" said Lottie. \"I always do hear when you say\r\nyour words as if they had little dashes under them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, Horace Thorne _is_ easier to get on with than his cousin,\" said Mrs.\r\nBlake, taking no notice of Lottie's mimicry.\r\n\r\n\"There, I said so: mamma would like it to be Horace. Nobody asks what I\r\nshould like--nobody thinks about me and Percival.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, indeed! I wasn't aware,\" said Mrs. Blake. \"When is that to come off? I\r\ndare say you will look very well in orange-blossoms and a pinafore!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you think I'm too young, do you? But a little while ago you were\r\nalways saying that I was grown up, and oughtn't to want any more childish\r\ngames. What was I to do?\"\r\n\r\n\"Upon my word!\" exclaimed Mrs. Blake. \"I'll buy you a doll for a birthday\r\npresent, to keep you out of mischief.\"\r\n\r\n\"Too late,\" said Lottie from the rug. She burst into sudden laughter, loud\r\nbut not unmelodious. \"What rubbish we are talking! Seventeen to-morrow, and\r\nAddie is nearly twenty; and sometimes I think I must be a hundred!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, you are talking nonsense now,\" Mrs. Blake exclaimed. \"Why, you baby!\r\nonly last November you would go into that wet meadow by the rectory to play\r\ntrap-and-ball with Robin and Jack. And such a fuss as there was if one\r\nwanted to make you the least tidy and respectable!\"\r\n\r\n\"Was that last November?\" Lottie stared thoughtfully into space. \"Queer\r\nthat last November should be so many years ago, isn't it? Poor little Cock\r\nRobin! I met him in the lane the day before he went away. They will keep\r\nhim in jackets, and he hates them so! I laughed at him, and told him to be\r\na good little boy and mind his book. He didn't seem to like it, somehow.\"\r\n\r\n\"I dare say he didn't,\" said Addie, who had been silently recovering\r\nherself: \"there's no mistake about it when you laugh at any one.\"\r\n\r\n\"There shall be no mistake about anything I do,\" Lottie asserted. \"I'm\r\ngoing to bed now.\" She sprang to her feet and stood looking at her sister:\r\n\"What jolly hair you've got, Addie!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yours is just as thick, or thicker,\" said Addie.\r\n\r\n\"Each individual hair is a good deal thicker, if you mean that.\r\n'Blue-black, lustrous, thick like horse-hairs!' That's what Percy quoted to\r\nme one day when I was grumbling, and I said I wasn't sure he wasn't rude.\r\nAddie, are Horace and Percival fond of each other?\"\r\n\r\n\"How can I tell? I suppose so.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have my doubts,\" said Lottie sagely. \"Why should they be? There must be\r\nsomething queer, you know, or why doesn't that stupid old man at\r\nBrackenhill treat Percival as the eldest? Well, good-night.\" And Lottie\r\nwent off, half saying, half singing, \"Who killed Cock Robin? I, said the\r\nSparrow--with my bow and arrow.\" And with a triumphant outburst of \"_I_\r\nkilled Cock Robin!\" she banged the door after her.\r\n\r\nThere was a pause. Then Addie said, \"Seventeen to-morrow! Mamma, Lottie\r\nreally is grown-up now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is she?\" Mrs. Blake replied doubtfully. \"Time she should be, I'm sure.\"\r\n\r\nLottie had been a sore trial to her mother. Addie was pretty as a child,\r\ntolerably presentable even at her most awkward age, glided gradually into\r\ngirlhood and beauty, and finally \"came out\" completely to Mrs. Blake's\r\nsatisfaction. But Lottie at fifteen or sixteen was her despair--\"Exactly\r\nlike a great unruly boy,\" she lamented. She dashed through her lessons\r\nfairly well, but the moment she was released she was unendurable. She\r\nwhistled, she sang at the top of her voice, and plunged about the house in\r\nher thick boots, till she could be off to join the two boys at the rectory,\r\nher dear friends and comrades. Robin Wingfield, the elder, was her junior\r\nby rather more than a year; and this advantage, especially as she was tall\r\nand strong for her age, enabled her fully to hold her own with them. Nor\r\ncould Mrs. Blake hinder this friendship, as she would gladly have done, for\r\nher husband was on Lottie's side.\r\n\r\n\"Let the girl alone,\" he said. \"Too big for this sort of thing? Rubbish!\r\nThe milliner's bills will come in quite soon enough. And what's amiss with\r\nRobin and Jack? Good boys as boys go, and she's another; and if they like\r\nto scramble over hedges and ditches together, let them. For Heaven's sake,\r\nCaroline, don't attempt to keep her at home: she'll certainly drive me\r\ncrazy if you do. No one ever banged doors as Lottie does: she ought to\r\npatent the process. Slams them with a crash which jars the whole house, and\r\nyet manages not to latch them, and the moment she is gone they are swinging\r\nbackward and forward till I'm almost out of my senses. Here she comes down\r\nstairs, like a thunderbolt.--Lottie, my dear girl, I'm sure it's going to\r\nbe fine: better run out and look up those Wingfield boys, I think.\"\r\n\r\nSo the trio spent long half-holidays rambling in the fields; and on these\r\noccasions Lottie might be met, an immense distance from home, in the\r\nshabbiest clothes and wearing a red cap of Robin's tossed carelessly on her\r\ndark hair. Percival once encountered them on one of these expeditions.\r\nLottie's beauty was still pale and unripe, like those sheathed buds which\r\nwill come suddenly to their glory of blossom, not like rosebuds which have\r\na loveliness of their own; but the young man was struck by the boyish\r\nmixture of shyness and bluntness with which she greeted him, and attracted\r\nby the great eyes which gazed at him from under Robin's shabby cap. When he\r\nand Horace went to the Blakes' he amused himself idly enough with the\r\nschool-girl, while his cousin flirted with Addie. He laughed one day when\r\nMrs. Blake was unusually troubled about Lottie's apparel, and said\r\nsomething about \"a sweet neglect.\" But the soul of Lottie's mamma was not\r\nto be comforted with scraps of poetry. How could it be, when she had just\r\narraigned her daughter on the charge of having her pockets bulging\r\nhideously, and had discovered that those receptacles overflowed with a\r\nmiscellaneous assortment of odds and ends, the accumulations of weeks,\r\ntending to show that Lottie and Cock Robin, as she called him, had all\r\nthings in common? How could it be, when Lottie was always outgrowing her\r\ngarments in the most ungainly manner, so that her sleeves seemed to retreat\r\nin horror from her wrists and from her long hands, tanned by sun and wind,\r\nseamed with bramble-scratches and smeared with school-room ink? Once Lottie\r\ncame home with an unmistakable black eye, for which Robin's cricket-ball\r\nwas accountable. Then, indeed, Mrs. Blake felt that her cup of bitterness\r\nwas full to overflowing, though Lottie did assure her, \"You should have\r\nseen Jack's eye last April: his was much more swollen, and all sorts of\r\ncolors, than mine.\" It was impossible to avoid the conclusion that Jack\r\nmust have been, to say the least of it, unpleasant to look at. Percival\r\nhappened to come to the house just then, and was tranquilly amused at the\r\ngood lady's despair. It was before the Blakes knew much of Horace, and she\r\nhad not yet discovered that Percival's cousin was so much more friendly\r\nthan Percival himself; so she made the latter her confidant. He recommended\r\na raw beefsteak with a gravity worthy of a Spanish grandee. He was not\r\nallowed to see Lottie, who was kept in seclusion as being half culprit,\r\nhalf invalid, and wholly unpresentable; but as he was going away the\r\nservant gave him a little note in Lottie's boyish scrawl:\r\n\r\n     \"DEAR PERCIVAL: Mamma was cross with Robin and sent him away\r\n     do tell him I'm all right, and he is not to mind he will be\r\n     sure to be about somewhere It is very stupid being shut up\r\n     here Addie says she can't go running about giving messages\r\n     to boys and Papa said if he saw him he should certainly\r\n     punch his head so please tell him he is not to bother\r\n     himself about me I shall soon be all right.\"\r\n\r\nPercival went away, smiling a little at his letter and at Lottie herself.\r\nJust as he reached the first of the fields which were the short cut from\r\nthe house, he spied Robin lurking on the other side of the hedge, with Jack\r\nat his heels. He halted, and called \"Robin! Robin Wingfield! I want to\r\nspeak to you.\"\r\n\r\nThe boy hesitated: \"There's a gate farther on.\"\r\n\r\nComing to the gate, Percival rested his arms on it and looked at Robin. The\r\nboy was not big for his age, but there was a good deal of cleverness in his\r\nupturned freckled face. \"I've a message for you,\" said the young man.\r\n\r\n\"From her?\" Robin indicated the Blakes' house with a jerk of his head.\r\n\r\n\"Yes. She asked me to tell you that she is all right, though, of course,\r\nshe can't come out at present. She made sure I should find you somewhere\r\nabout.\"\r\n\r\nRobin nodded: \"I did try to hear how she was, but that old dragon--\"\r\n\r\n\"Meaning my friend Mrs. Blake?\" said young Thorne. \"Ah! Hardly civil\r\nperhaps, but forcible.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well--Mrs. Blake, then--caught me in the shrubbery and pitched into me.\r\nSaid I ought to be ashamed of myself. Supposed I should be satisfied when\r\nI'd broken Lottie's neck. Told me I'd better not show my face there again.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Percival, \"you couldn't expect Mrs. Blake to be particularly\r\ndelighted with your afternoon's work. And, Wingfield, though I was\r\nespecially to tell you that you were not to vex yourself about it, you\r\nreally ought to be more careful. Knocking a young lady's eye half out--\"\r\n\r\n\"Young lady!\" in a tone of intense scorn. \"Lottie isn't a _young lady_.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! isn't she?\" said Percival.\r\n\r\n\"I should think not, indeed!\" And Robin eyed the big young man who was\r\nlaughing at him as if he meditated wiping out the insult to Lottie then and\r\nthere. But even with Jack, his sturdy satellite, to help, it was not to be\r\nthought of. \"She's a brick!\" said Cock Robin, half to himself.\r\n\r\n\"No doubt,\" said Percival. \"But, as I was saying, it isn't exactly the way\r\nto treat her.--At least--I don't know: upon my word, I don't know,\" he\r\nsoliloquized. \"Judging by most women's novels, from _Jane Eyre_ downward,\r\nthe taste for muscular bullies prevails. Robin may be the coming hero--who\r\nknows?--and courtship commencing with a black eye the future\r\nfashion.--Well, Robin, any answer?\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell her I hope she'll soon be all right. Shall you see her?\"\r\n\r\n\"I can see that she gets any message you want to send.\"\r\n\r\nRobin groped among his treasures: \"Look here: I brought away her knife that\r\nafternoon. She lent it me. She'd better have it--it's got four blades--she\r\nmay want it, perhaps.\"\r\n\r\nPercival dropped the formidable instrument carelessly into his pocket: \"She\r\nshall have it. And, Robin, you'd better not be hanging about here: Lottie\r\nsays so. You'll only vex Mrs. Blake.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right!\" said the boy, and went off, with Jack after him.\r\n\r\nPercival, who was staying in the neighborhood, went straight home, tied up\r\na parcel of books he thought might amuse Lottie in her imprisonment, and\r\nwrote a note to go with them. He was whistling softly to himself as he\r\nwrote, and, if the truth be told, had a fair vision floating before his\r\neyes--a girl of whom Lottie had reminded him by sheer force of contrast.\r\nStill, he liked Lottie in her way. He was young enough to enjoy the easy\r\nsense of patronage and superiority which made the words flow so pleasantly\r\nfrom his pen. Never had Lottie seemed to him so utterly a child as\r\nimmediately after his talk with her boy-friend.\r\n\r\n\"Here are some books,\" said the hurrying pen, \"which I think you will like\r\nif your eye is not so bad as to prevent your reading. Robin was keeping his\r\ndisconsolate watch close by, as you foretold, and asked anxiously after\r\nyou, so I gave him your message and dismissed him. He especially charged me\r\nto send you the enclosed--knife I believe he called it: it looks to me like\r\na whole armory of deadly weapons--which he seemed to think would be a\r\ncomfort to you in your affliction. I sincerely hope it may prove so. I was\r\nvery civil to him, remembering that I was your ambassador; but if he isn't\r\na little less rough with you in future, I shall be tempted to adopt Mr.\r\nBlake's plan if I happen to meet your friend again. You really mustn't let\r\nhim damage those eyes of yours in this reckless fashion. Mrs. Blake was\r\nnearly heartbroken this morning.\"\r\n\r\nHe sent his parcel off, and speedily ceased to think of it. And Lottie\r\nherself might have done the same, not caring much for his books, but for\r\nfour little words--\"those eyes of yours.\" Had Percival written \"your eyes,\"\r\nit would have meant nothing, but \"those eyes of yours\" implied notice--nay,\r\nadmiration. Again and again she looked at the thick paper, with the crest\r\nat the top and the vigorous lines of writing below; and again and again the\r\nfour words, \"those eyes of yours,\" seemed to spring into ever-clearer\r\nprominence. She hid the letter away with a sudden comprehension of the\r\nroughness of her pencil scrawl which it answered, and began to take pride\r\nin her looks when they least deserved it. Only a day or two before she had\r\nenvied Robin the possession of sight a little keener than her own, but now\r\nshe smiled to think that Percival Thorne would never have regretted injury\r\nto \"those eyes of yours\" had she owned Robin's light-gray orbs.\r\n\r\nHer transformation had begun. The knife was still a treasure, but she was\r\nashamed of her delight in it. She breathed on the shining blades and rubbed\r\nthem to brightness again, but she did it stealthily, with a glance over her\r\nshoulder first. She went rambling with Robin and Jack, but not when she\r\nknew that Percival Thorne was in the neighborhood. She was very sure of his\r\nabsence on the November day to which her mother had alluded, when she had\r\ninsisted on playing trap-and-ball in the rectory meadows. Mrs. Blake did\r\nnot realize it, but it was almost the last day of Lottie's old life. At\r\nChristmas-time they were asked to stay for a few days at a friend's house.\r\nThere was to be a dance, and the hostess, being Lottie's godmother,\r\npointedly included her in the invitation; so Mrs. Blake and Addie did what\r\nthey could to improve their black sheep's appearance.\r\n\r\nLottie, dressed for the eventful evening, was left alone for a moment\r\nbefore the three went down. She felt shy, dispirited and sullen. Her\r\nball-dress encumbered and constrained her. \"I hate it all,\" she said to\r\nherself, beating impatiently with her foot upon the ground. Something\r\nmoving caught her eye: it was her reflection in a mirror. She paused and\r\ngazed in wonder. Was this slender girl, arrayed in a cloud of\r\nsemi-transparent white, really herself--the Lottie who only a few days\r\nbefore had raced Robin Wingfield home across the fields, had been the first\r\nover the gap and through the ditch into the rectory meadow, and had rushed\r\naway with the November rain-drops driving in her face? She gazed on: the\r\ntransformation had its charms, after all. But the shadow came back: \"It's\r\nno use. Addie's prettier than I ever shall be: I must be second all my\r\nlife. Second! If I can't be A 1, I'd as soon be Z 1000! I won't go about\r\nto be a foil to her. I'd ten times rather race with Robin; and I will too!\r\nThey sha'n't coop me up and make a young lady of me!\"\r\n\r\nShe caught the flash of her indignant glance in the glass and paused.\r\n\r\n\"_Those eyes of yours!_\"\r\n\r\n_Must_ she be second all her life? Had she not a power and witchery of her\r\nown? Might she not even distance Addie in the race? \"I've more brains than\r\nshe has,\" mused Lottie.\r\n\r\nHer heart was beating fast as they came down stairs. They had only arrived\r\nby a late train, which gave them just time to dress; and Mrs. Blake had\r\nrather exceeded the allowance, so that most of the guests had arrived and\r\nthe first quadrille was nearly ended as they came in. Lottie followed her\r\nmother and Addie as they glided through the crowd, and when they paused she\r\nstood shy and fierce, casting lowering glances around.\r\n\r\nShe heard their hostess say to some one, \"Do let me find you a partner.\"\r\n\r\nA well-known voice replied, \"Not this time, thank you: I'm going to try to\r\nfind one for myself;\" and Percival stood before her, looking, to her\r\ngirlish fancy, more of a hero than ever in the evening-dress which became\r\nhim well. The perfectly-fitting gloves, the flower in his coat, a dozen\r\nlittle things which she could not define, made her feel uncouth and\r\nanxious, fascinated and frightened, all at once. Had he greeted her in the\r\npatronizing way in which he had talked to her of old, she would have been\r\ndeeply wounded, but he asked her for the next dance more ceremoniously, she\r\nknew, than Horace would have asked Addie. Still, she trembled as they moved\r\noff. They had scarcely met since her note to him. Suppose he alluded to it,\r\nasked after her black eye, and inquired whether she had derived any benefit\r\nfrom the beefsteak? Nothing more natural, and yet if he did Lottie felt\r\nthat she should _hate_ him. \"I know I should do something dreadful,\" she\r\nthought--\"scratch his face, and then burst out crying, most likely. Oh,\r\nwhat would become of me? I should be ruined for life! I should have to\r\nshut myself up, never see any one again, and emigrate with Robin directly\r\nhe was old enough.\"\r\n\r\nPercival did not know his danger, but he escaped it. The fatal thoughts\r\nwere in his mind while Lottie was planning her disgrace and exile, but he\r\nmerely remarked that he liked the first waltz, and should they start at\r\nonce or wait a moment till a couple or two dropped out?\r\n\r\n\"I don't know whether I _can_ waltz,\" said Lottie doubtfully.\r\n\r\n\"Weren't you over tortured with dancing-lessons?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes. But I've never tried at a party. Suppose we go bumping up against\r\neverybody, like that fat man and the little lady in pink--the two who are\r\njust stopping?\"\r\n\r\n\"I assure you,\" said Percival gravely, \"that I do not dance at all like\r\nthat fat man. And if you dance like the lady in pink, I shall be more\r\nsurprised than I have words to say. Now?\"\r\n\r\nThey were off. Percival knew that he waltzed well, and had an idea that\r\nLottie would prove a good partner. Nor was he mistaken. She had been fairly\r\ntaught, much against her will, had a good ear for time, and, thanks to many\r\na race with Robin Wingfield, her energy was almost terrible. They spun\r\nswiftly and silently round, unwearied while other couples dropped out of\r\nthe ranks to rest and talk. Percival was well pleased. It is true that he\r\nhad memories of waltzes with Sissy Langton of more utter harmony, of\r\nsweeter grace, of delight more perfect, though far more fleeting. But\r\nLottie, with her steady swiftness and her strong young life, had a charm of\r\nher own which he was not slow to recognize. She would hardly have thanked\r\nhim for accurately classifying it, for as she danced she felt that she had\r\ndiscovered a new joy. Her old life slipped from her like a husk. Friendship\r\nwith Cock Robin was an evident absurdity. It is true she was angry with\r\nherself that, after fighting so passionately for freedom, she should\r\nvoluntarily bend her proud neck beneath the yoke. She foresaw that her\r\nmother and Addie would triumph; she felt that her bondage to Mrs. Grundy\r\nwould often be irksome; but here was the first instalment of her wages in\r\nthis long waltz with Percival. She fancied that the secret of her pleasure\r\nlay in the two words--\"with Percival.\" In her ignorance she thought that\r\nshe was tasting the honeyed fire of love, when in truth it was the\r\nsweetness of conscious success. Before the last notes of that enchanted\r\nmusic died away she had cast her girlish devotion, \"half in a rapture and\r\nhalf in a rage,\" at her partner's feet, while he stood beside her calm and\r\nself-possessed. He would have been astounded, and perhaps almost disgusted,\r\nhad he known what was passing through her mind.\r\n\r\nLove at sixteen is generally only a desire to be in love, and seeks not so\r\nmuch a fit as a possible object. Probably Lottie's passion offered as many\r\nassurances of domestic bliss as could be desired at her age.\r\n\r\nPercival was dark, foreign-looking and handsome: he had an interesting air\r\nof reserve, and no apparent need to practise small economies. His clothes\r\nfitted him extremely well, and at times he had a way of standing proudly\r\naloof which was worthy of any hero of romance. No settled occupation would\r\ninterfere with picnics and balls; and, to crown all, had he not said to\r\nher, \"Those eyes of yours\"? Were not these ample foundations for the\r\nhappiness of thirty or forty years of marriage?\r\n\r\nPercival, meanwhile, wanted to be kind to the childish, half-tamed Lottie,\r\nwho had attracted his notice in the fields and trusted him with her\r\ngenerous message to Robin Wingfield. The girl fancied herself immensely\r\nimproved by her white dress, but had Thorne been a painter he would have\r\nsketched her as a pale vision of Liberty, with loosely-knotted hair and\r\ndark eyes glowing under Robin's red cap. He was able coolly to determine\r\nthe precise nature of his pleasure in her society, but he knew that it was\r\na pleasure. And Lottie, when she fell asleep that night, clasped a card\r\nwhich was rendered priceless by the frequent recurrence of his initials.\r\n\r\nHer passion transformed her. Her vehement spirit remained, but everything\r\nelse was changed. Her old dreams and longings were cast out by the new. She\r\nlaughed with Mrs. Blake and Addie, but under the laughter she hid her love,\r\nand cherished it in fierce and solitary silence. Yet even to herself the\r\ntransformation seemed so wonderful that she could hardly believe in it, and\r\nacted the rough girl now and then with the idea that otherwise they _must_\r\nthink her a consummate actress morning, noon and night. For some months no\r\ngreat event marked the record of her unsuspected passion. It might,\r\nperhaps, have run its course, and died out harmlessly in due time, but for\r\nan unlucky afternoon, about a week before her birthday, when Percival\r\nuttered some thoughtless words which woke a tempest of doubt and fear in\r\nLottie's heart. She did not question his love, but she caught a glimpse of\r\nhis pride, and felt as if a gulf had opened between her and her dream of\r\nhappiness.\r\n\r\nPercival was calling at the house on the eventful day which was destined to\r\ninfluence Lottie's fate and his own. He was in a happy mood, well pleased\r\nwith things in general, and, after his own fashion, inclined to be\r\ntalkative. When visitors arrived and Addie exclaimed, \"Mrs. Pickering and\r\nthat boy of hers--oh bother!\" she spoke the feelings of the whole party;\r\nand Percival from his place by the window looked across at Lottie and\r\nshrugged his shoulders expressively. Had there been time he would have\r\ntried to escape into the garden with his girl friend; but as that was\r\nimpossible, he resigned himself to his fate and listened while Mrs.\r\nPickering poured forth her rapture concerning her son's prospects to Mrs.\r\nBlake. An uncle who was the head of a great London firm had offered the\r\nyoung man a situation, with an implied promise of a share in the business\r\nlater. \"Such a subject for congratulation!\" the good lady exclaimed,\r\nbeaming on her son, who sat silently turning his hat in his hands and\r\nlooking very pink. \"Such an opening for William! Better than having a\r\nfortune left him, I call it, for it is such a thing to have an occupation.\r\nEvery young man should be brought up to something, in my opinion.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Blake, with a half glance at Addie and a thought of Horace, suggested\r\nthat heirs to landed estates--\r\n\r\n\"Well, yes.\" Mrs. Pickering agreed with her. Country gentlemen often found\r\nso much to do in looking after their tenants and making improvements that\r\nshe would not say anything about them. But young men with small incomes and\r\nno profession--she should be sorry if a son of hers--\r\n\r\n\"Like me, for instance,\" said Percival, looking up. \"I've a small income\r\nand no profession.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Pickering, somewhat confused, hastened to explain that she meant\r\nnothing personal.\r\n\r\n\"Of course not,\" he said: \"I know that. I only mentioned it because I think\r\nan illustration stamps a thing on people's memories.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, Percival,\" Mrs. Blake interposed, \"I must say that in this I agree\r\nwith Mrs. Pickering. I do think it would be better if you had something to\r\ndo--I do indeed.\" She looked at him with an air of affectionate severity.\r\n\"I speak as your friend, you know.\" (Percival bowed his gratitude.) \"I\r\nreally think young people are happier when they have a settled occupation.\"\r\n\r\n\"I dare say that is true, as a rule,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"But you don't think you would be?\" questioned Lottie.\r\n\r\nHe turned to her with a smile: \"Well, I doubt it. Of course I don't know\r\nhow happy I might be if I had been brought up to a profession.\" He glanced\r\nthrough the open window at the warm loveliness of June. \"At this moment,\r\nfor instance, I might have been writing a sermon or cutting off a man's\r\nleg. But, somehow, I am very well satisfied as I am.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, if you mean to make fun of it--\" Mrs. Blake began.\r\n\r\n\"But I don't,\" Percival said quickly. \"I may laugh, but I'm in earnest too.\r\nI have plenty to eat and drink; I can pay my tailor and still have a little\r\nmoney in my pocket; I am my own master. Sometimes I ride--another man's\r\nhorse: if not I walk, and am just as well content. I don't smoke--I don't\r\nbet--I have no expensive tastes. What could money do for me that I should\r\nspend the best years of my life in slaving for it?\"\r\n\r\n\"That may be all very well for the present,\" said Mrs. Blake.\r\n\r\n\"Why not for the future too? Oh, I have my dream for the future too.\"\r\n\r\n\"And, pray, may one ask what it is?\" said Mrs. Pickering, looking down on\r\nhim from the height of William's prosperity.\r\n\r\n\"Certainly,\" he said. \"Some day I shall leave England and travel leisurely\r\nabout the Continent. I shall have a sky over my head compared with which\r\nthis blue is misty and pale. I shall gain new ideas. I shall get grapes and\r\nfigs and melons very cheap. There will be a little too much garlic in my\r\ndaily life--even such a destiny as mine must have its drawbacks--but think\r\nof the wonderful scenery I shall see and the queer, beautiful\r\nout-of-the-way holes and corners I shall discover! And in years to come I\r\nshall rejoice, without envy, to hear that Mr. Blake has bought a large\r\nestate and gains prizes for fat cattle, while my friend here has been\r\nknighted on the occasion of some city demonstration.\"\r\n\r\nYoung Pickering, who had been listening open-mouthed to the other's fluent\r\nand tranquil speech, reddened at the allusion to himself and dropped his\r\nhat.\r\n\r\n\"At that rate you must never marry,\" said Mrs. Blake.\r\n\r\nPercival thoughtfully stroked his lip: \"You think I should not find a wife\r\nto share my enjoyment of a small income?\"\r\n\r\n\"Marry a girl with lots of money, Mr. Thorne,\" said the future Sir William,\r\nfeeling it incumbent on him to take part in the conversation.\r\n\r\n\"Not I.\" Percival's glance made the lad's hot face yet hotter. \"That's the\r\nlast thing I will do. If a man means to work, he may marry whom he will.\r\nBut if he has made up his mind to be idle, he is a contemptible cur if he\r\nwill let his wife keep him in his idleness.\" He spoke very quietly in his\r\nsoft voice, and leaned back in his chair.\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, you must never fall in love with an heiress,\" said Mrs.\r\nBlake.\r\n\r\n\"Or you must work and win her,\" Lottie suggested almost in a whisper.\r\n\r\nHe smiled, but slightly shook his head with a look which she fancied meant\r\n\"Too late.\" Mrs. Pickering began to tell the latest Fordborough scandal,\r\nand the talk drifted into another channel.\r\n\r\nLottie had listened as she always listened when Percival spoke, but she had\r\nnot attached any peculiar meaning to his words. But an hour or so later,\r\nwhen he was gone and she was loitering in the garden just outside the\r\nwindow, Addie, who was within, made some remark in a laughing tone. Lottie\r\ndid not catch the words, but Mrs. Blake's reply was distinct and not to be\r\nmistaken: \"William Pickering, indeed! No: with your looks and your\r\nexpectations you girls ought to marry really well.\" Lottie stood aghast.\r\nThey would have money, then? She had never thought about money. She would\r\nbe an heiress? And Percival would never marry an heiress--he could not: had\r\nhe not said so? How gladly would she have given him every farthing she\r\npossessed! And was her fortune to be a barrier between them for ever? Every\r\nsyllable that he had spoken was made clear by this revelation, and rose up\r\nbefore her eyes as a terrible word of doom. But she was not one to be\r\neasily dismayed, and her first cry was, \"What shall I do?\" Lottie's\r\nthoughts turned always to action, not to endurance, and she was resolved to\r\nbreak down the barrier, let the cost be what it might. Her talk with\r\nGodfrey Hammond gave a new interest to her romance and new strength to her\r\ndetermination. Since her hero was disinherited and poor, and she, though\r\nrich, would be poor in all she cared to have if she were parted from him,\r\nmight she not tell him so when she saw him on her birthday? She thought it\r\nwould be easier to speak on the one day when in girlish fashion she would\r\nbe queen. She would not think of her own pride, because his pride was dear\r\nto her. She could not tell what she would say or do: she only knew that her\r\nbirthday should decide her fate. And her heart was beating fast in hope\r\nand fear the night before when she banged the door after her and went off\r\nto bed, sublimely ready to renounce the world for Percival.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nDEAD MEN TELL NO TALES--ALFRED THORNE'S IS TOLD BY THE WRITER.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Thorne of Brackenhill was a miserable man, who went through the world\r\nwith a morbidly sensitive spot in his nature. A touch on it was torture,\r\nand unfortunately the circumstances of his daily life continually chafed\r\nit.\r\n\r\nIt was only a common form of selfishness carried to excess. \"I don't want\r\nmuch,\" he would have said--truly enough, for Godfrey Thorne had never been\r\ngrasping--\"but let it be my own.\" He could not enjoy anything unless he\r\nknew that he might waste it if he liked. The highest good, fettered by any\r\ncondition, was in his eyes no good at all. Brackenhill was dear to him\r\nbecause he could leave it to whom he would. He was seventy-six, and had\r\nspent his life in improving his estate, but he prized nothing about it so\r\nmuch as his right to give the result of his life's work to the first beggar\r\nhe might chance to meet. It would have made him still happier if he could\r\nhave had the power of destroying Brackenhill utterly, of wiping it off the\r\nface of the earth, in case he could not find an heir who pleased him, for\r\nit troubled him to think that some man _must_ have the land after him,\r\nwhether he wished it or not.\r\n\r\nGodfrey Hammond had declared that no one could conceive the exquisite\r\ntorments Mr. Thorne would endure if he owned an estate with a magnificent\r\nruin on it, some unique and priceless relic of bygone days. \"He should be\r\nable to see it from his window,\" said Hammond, \"and it should be his, as\r\nfar as law could make it, while he should be continually conscious that in\r\nthe eyes of all cultivated men he was merely its guardian. People should\r\nwrite to the newspapers asserting boldly that the public had a right of\r\nfree access to it, and old gentlemen with antiquarian tastes should find a\r\nlittle gap in a fence, and pen indignant appeals to the editor demanding to\r\nbe immediately informed whether a monument of national, nay, of world-wide\r\ninterest, ought not, for the sake of the public, to be more carefully\r\nprotected from injury. Local archæological societies should come and read\r\npapers in it. Clergymen, wishing to combine a little instruction with the\r\npleasures of a school-feast, should arrive with van-loads of cheering boys\r\nand girls, a troop of ardent teachers, many calico flags and a brass band.\r\nArtists, keen-eyed and picturesque, each with his good-humored air of\r\npossessing the place so much more truly than any mere country gentleman\r\never could, should come to gaze and sketch. Meanwhile, Thorne should remark\r\nabout twice a week that of course he could pull the whole thing down if he\r\nliked; to which every one should smile assent, recognizing an evident but\r\nutterly unimportant fact. And then,\" said Hammond solemnly, \"when all the\r\narchæologists were eating and drinking, enjoying their own theories and\r\npicking holes in their neighbors' discoveries, the bolt should fall in the\r\nshape of an announcement that Mr. Thorne had sold the stones as building\r\nmaterials, and that the workmen had already removed the most ancient and\r\ninteresting part. After which he would go slowly to his grave, dying of his\r\ntriumph and a broken heart.\"\r\n\r\nIt was all quite true, though Godfrey Hammond might have added that all the\r\nexecrations of the antiquarians would hardly have added to the burden of\r\nshame and remorse of which Mr. Thorne would have felt the weight before the\r\nlast cart carried away its load from the trampled sward; that he would have\r\nregretted his decision every hour of his life; and if by a miracle he could\r\nhave found himself once more with the fatal deed undone, he would have\r\nrejoiced for a moment, suffered his old torment for a little while, and\r\nthen proceeded to do it again.\r\n\r\nFor a great part of Mr. Thorne's life the boast of his power over\r\nBrackenhill had been on his lips more frequently than the twice a week of\r\nwhich Hammond talked. Of late years it had not been so. He had used his\r\npower to assure himself that he possessed it, and gradually awoke to the\r\nconsciousness that he had lost it by thus using it.\r\n\r\nHe had had three sons--Maurice, a fine, high-spirited young fellow; Alfred,\r\ngood-looking and good-tempered, but indolent; James, a slim, sickly lad,\r\nwho inherited from his mother a fatal tendency to decline. She died while\r\nhe was a baby, and he was petted from that time forward. Godfrey Thorne was\r\nwell satisfied with Maurice, but was always at war with his second son, who\r\nwould not take orders and hold the family living. They argued the matter\r\ntill it was too late for Alfred to go into the army, the only career for\r\nwhich he had expressed any desire; and then Mr. Thorne found himself face\r\nto face with a gentle and lazy resistance which threatened to be a match\r\nfor his own hard obstinacy. Alfred didn't mind being a farmer. But his\r\nfather was troubled about the necessary capital, and doubted his son's\r\nsuccess: \"You will go on after a fashion for a few years, and then all the\r\nmoney will have slipped through your fingers. You know nothing of\r\nfarming.\"--\"That's true,\" said Alfred.--\"And you are much too lazy to\r\nlearn.\"--\"That's very likely,\" said the young man. So Mr. Thorne looked\r\nabout him for some more eligible opening for his troublesome son; and\r\nAlfred meanwhile, with his handsome face and honest smile, was busy making\r\nlove to Sarah Percival, the rector's daughter.\r\n\r\nThe little idyl was the talk of the villagers before it came to the\r\nsquire's ears. When he questioned Alfred the young man confessed it readily\r\nenough. He loved Miss Percival, and she didn't mind waiting. Mr. Thorne was\r\nnot altogether displeased, for, though his intercourse with the rector was\r\nrather stormy and uncertain, they happened to be on tolerable terms just\r\nthen. Sarah was an only child, and would have a little money at Mr.\r\nPercival's death, and Alfred was much more submissive and anxious to please\r\nhis father under these altered circumstances. The young people were not to\r\nconsider themselves engaged, Miss Percival being only eighteen and Alfred\r\none-and-twenty. But if they were of the same mind later, when the latter\r\nshould be in a position to marry, it was understood that neither his father\r\nnor Mr. Percival would oppose it.\r\n\r\nUnluckily, a parochial question arose near Christmas-time, and the squire\r\nand the clergyman took different views of it. Mr. Thorne went about the\r\nhouse with brows like a thunder-cloud, and never opened his lips to Alfred\r\nexcept to abuse the rector. \"You'll have to choose between old Percival and\r\nme one of these days,\" he said more than once. \"You'd better be making up\r\nyour mind: it will save time.\" Alfred was silent. When the strife was at\r\nits height Maurice was drowned while skating.\r\n\r\nThe poor fellow was hardly in his grave before the storm burst on Alfred's\r\nhead. If Mr. Thorne had barely tolerated the idea of his son's marriage\r\nbefore, he found it utterly intolerable now; and the decree went forth that\r\nthis boyish folly about Miss Percival must be forgotten. \"I can do as I\r\nlike with Brackenhill,\" said Mr. Thorne: \"remember that.\" Alfred did\r\nremember it. He had heard it often enough, and his father's angry eyes gave\r\nit an added emphasis. \"I can make an eldest son of James if I like, and I\r\nwill if you defy me.\" But nothing could shake Alfred. He had given his word\r\nto Miss Percival, and they loved each other, and he meant to keep to it.\r\n\"You don't believe me,\" his father thundered: \"you think I may talk, but\r\nthat I sha'n't do it. Take care!\" There was no trace of any conflict on\r\nAlfred's face: he looked a little dull and heavy under the bitter storm,\r\nbut that was all. \"I can't help it, sir,\" he said, tracing the pattern of\r\nthe carpet with the toe of his boot as he stood: \"you will do as you\r\nplease, I suppose.\"--\"I suppose I shall,\" said Mr. Thorne.\r\n\r\nSo Alfred was disinherited. \"As well for this as anything else,\" he said:\r\n\"we couldn't have got on long.\" He had an allowance from his father, who\r\ndeclined to take any further interest in his plans. He went abroad for a\r\ncouple of years--a test which Mr. Percival imposed upon him that nothing\r\nmight be done in haste--and came back, faithful as he went, to ask for the\r\nconsent which could no longer be denied. Mr. Percival had been presented to\r\na living at some distance from Brackenhill, and, as there was a good deal\r\nof glebe-land attached to it, Alfred was able to try his hand at farming.\r\nHe did so, with a little loss if no gain, and they made one household at\r\nthe rectory.\r\n\r\nHe never seemed to regret Brackenhill. Sarah--dark, ardent, intense, a\r\nstrange contrast to his own fair, handsome face and placid\r\nindolence--absorbed all his love. Her eager nature could not rouse him to\r\nbattle with the world, but it woke a passionate devotion in his heart: they\r\nwere everything to each other, and were content. When their boy was born\r\nthe rector would have named him Godfrey: at any rate, he urged them to call\r\nhim by one of the old family names which had been borne by bygone\r\ngenerations of Thornes. But the young husband was resolved that the child\r\nshould be Percival, and Percival only. \"Why prejudice his grandfather\r\nagainst him for a mere name?\" the rector persisted. But Alfred shook his\r\nhead. \"Percival means all the happiness of my life,\" he said. So the child\r\nreceived his name, and the fact was announced to Mr. Thorne in a letter\r\nbrief and to the point like a challenge.\r\n\r\nCommunications with Brackenhill were few and far between. From the local\r\npapers Alfred heard of the rejoicings when James came of age, quickly\r\nfollowed by the announcement that he had gone abroad for the winter. Then\r\nhe was at home again, and going to marry Miss Harriet Benham; whereat\r\nAlfred smiled a little. \"The governor must have put his pride in his\r\npocket: old Benham made his money out of composite candles, then retired,\r\nand has gas all over the house for fear they should be mentioned. Harry, as\r\nwe used to call her, is the youngest of them--she must be eight or nine and\r\ntwenty; fine girl, hunts--tried it on with poor Maurice ages ago. I should\r\nthink she was about half as big again as Jim. Well, yes, perhaps I am\r\nexaggerating a little. How charmed my father must be!--only, of course,\r\nanything to please Jim, and it's a fine thing to have him married and\r\nsettled.\"\r\n\r\nAlfred read his father's feelings correctly enough, but Mr. Thorne was\r\nalmost repaid for all he had endured when, in his turn, he was able to\r\nwrite and announce the birth of a boy for whom the bells had been set\r\nringing as the heir of Brackenhill. Jim, with his sick fancies and\r\nquerulous conceit, Mrs. James Thorne, with her coarsely-colored splendor\r\nand imperious ways, faded into the background now that Horace's little star\r\nhad risen.\r\n\r\nThe rest may be briefly told. Horace had a little sister who died, and he\r\nhimself could hardly remember his father. His time was divided between his\r\nmother's house at Brighton and Brackenhill. He grew slim and tall and\r\nhandsome--a Thorne, and not a Benham, as his grandfather did not fail to\r\nnote. He was delicate. \"But he will outgrow that,\" said Mrs. Middleton, and\r\nloved him the better for the care she had to take of him. It was\r\nprincipally for his sake that she was there. She was a widow and had no\r\nchildren of her own, but when, at her brother's request, she came to\r\nBrackenhill to make more of a home for the school-boy, she brought with her\r\na tiny girl, little Sissy Langton, a great-niece of her husband's.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the other boy grew up in his quiet home, but death came there as\r\nwell as to Brackenhill, and seemed to take the mainspring of the household\r\nin taking Sarah Thorne. Her father pined for her, and had no pleasure in\r\nlife except in her child. Even when the old man was growing feeble, and it\r\nwas manifest to all but the boy that he would not long be parted from his\r\ndaughter, it was a sombre but not an unhappy home for the child. Something\r\nin the shadow which overhung it, in his grandfather's weakness and his\r\nfather's silence, made him grave and reserved, but he always felt that he\r\nwas loved. No playful home-name was ever bestowed on the little lad, but\r\nit did not matter, for when spoken by Alfred Thorne no name could be so\r\ntender as Percival.\r\n\r\nThe rector's death when the boy was fifteen broke up the only real home he\r\nwas destined to know, for Alfred was unable to settle down in any place for\r\nany length of time. While his wife and her father were alive their\r\ninfluence over him was supreme: he was like the needle drawn aside by a\r\npowerful attraction. But now that they were gone his thoughts oscillated a\r\nwhile, and then reverted to Brackenhill. For himself he was content--he had\r\nmade his choice long ago--but little by little the idea grew up in his mind\r\nthat Percival was wronged, for he, at least, was guiltless. He secretly\r\nregretted the defiant fashion in which his boy had been christened, and\r\nmade a feeble attempt to prove that, after all, Percy was an old family\r\nname. He succeeded in establishing that a \"P. Thorne\" had once existed, who\r\nof course might have been Percy, as he might have been Peter or Paul; and\r\nhe tried to call his son Percy in memory of this doubtful namesake. But the\r\nthree syllables were as dear to the boy as the white flag to a Bourbon.\r\nThey identified him with the mother he dimly remembered, and proclaimed to\r\nall the world (that is, to his grandfather) that for her sake he counted\r\nBrackenhill well lost. He triumphed, and his father was proud to be\r\ndefeated. To this day he invariably writes himself \"Percival Thorne.\"\r\n\r\nAlfred, however, had his way on a more important point, and educated his\r\nson for no profession, because the head of the house needed none. Percival\r\nacquiesced willingly enough, without a thought of the implied protest. He\r\nwas indolent, and had little or no ambition. Since daily bread--and,\r\nluckily, rather more than daily bread, for he was no ascetic--was secured\r\nto him, since books were many and the world was wide, he asked nothing\r\nbetter than to study them. He grew up grave, dreamy and somewhat solitary\r\nin his ways. He seemed to have inherited something of the rector's\r\nself-possessed and rather formal courtesy, and at twenty he looked older\r\nthan his age, though his face was as smooth as a girl's.\r\n\r\nHe was not twenty-one, when his father died suddenly of fever. When the\r\nnews reached Brackenhill the old squire was singularly affected by it. He\r\nhad been accustomed to contrast Alfred's vigorous prime with his own\r\nadvanced age, Percival's unbroken health with Horace's ailing boyhood, and\r\nto think mournfully of the probability that the old manor-house must go to\r\na stranger unless he could humble himself to the son who had defied him.\r\nBut, old as he was, he had outlived his son, and he was dismayed at his\r\nisolation. A whole generation was dead and gone, and the two lads, who were\r\nall that remained of the Thornes of Brackenhill, stood far away, as though\r\nhe stretched his trembling hands to them across their fathers' graves. He\r\nexpressly requested that Percival should come and see him, and the young\r\nman presented himself in his deep mourning. Sissy, just sixteen, looked\r\nupon him as a sombre hero of romance, and within two days of his coming\r\nMrs. Middleton announced that her brother was \"perfectly infatuated about\r\nthat boy.\"\r\n\r\nThe evening of his arrival he stood with his grandfather on the terrace\r\nlooking at the wide prospect which lay at their feet--ample fields and\r\nmeadows, and the silvery flash of water through the willows. Then he\r\nturned, folded his arms and coolly surveyed Brackenhill itself from end to\r\nend. Mr. Thorne watched him, expecting some word, but when none came, and\r\nPercival's eyes wandered upward to the soft evening sky, where a glimmering\r\nstar hung like a lamp above the old gray manor-house, he said, with some\r\namusement, \"Well, and what is your opinion?\"\r\n\r\nPercival came down to earth with the greatest promptitude: \"It's a\r\nbeautiful place. I'm glad to see it. I like looking over old houses.\"\r\n\r\n\"Like looking over old houses? As if it were merely a show! Isn't\r\nBrackenhill more to you than any other old house?\" demanded Mr. Thorne.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, well, perhaps,\" Percival allowed: \"I have heard my father talk of it\r\nof course.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come, come! You are not such an outsider as all that,\" said his\r\ngrandfather.\r\n\r\nThe young man smiled a little, but did not speak.\r\n\r\n\"You don't forget you are a Thorne, I hope?\" the other went on. \"There are\r\nnone too many of us.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Percival. \"I like the old house, and I can assure you, sir, that\r\nI am proud of both my names.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, well! very good names. But shouldn't you call a man a lucky fellow\r\nif he owned a place like this?\"\r\n\r\n\"My opinion wouldn't be half as well worth having as yours,\" was the reply.\r\n\"What do you call yourself, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you think I own this place?\" Mr. Thorne inquired.\r\n\r\n\"Why, yes--I always supposed so. Don't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I don't!\" The answer was almost a snarl. \"I'm bailiff, overlooker,\r\nanything you like to call it. My master is at Oxford, at Christ Church. He\r\nwon't read, and he can't row, so he is devoting his time to learning how to\r\nget rid of the money I am to save up for him. _I_ own Brackenhill?\" He\r\nfaced abruptly round. \"All that timber is mine, they say; and if I cut down\r\na stick your aunt Middleton is at me: 'Think of Horace.' The place was\r\nmortgaged when I came into it. I pinched and saved--I freed it--for Horace.\r\nWhy shouldn't I mortgage it again if I please--raise money and live royally\r\ntill my time comes, eh? They'd all be at me, dinning 'Horace! Horace!' and\r\nmy duty to those who come after me, into my ears. Look at the drawing-room\r\nfurniture!\"\r\n\r\n\"The prettiest old room I ever saw,\" said Percival.\r\n\r\n\"Ah! you're right there. But my sister doesn't think so. It's shabby, she\r\nwould tell you. But does she ask me to furnish it for her? No, no, it isn't\r\nworth while: mine is such a short lease. When Horace marries and comes into\r\nhis inheritance, of course it must be done up. It would be a pity to waste\r\nmoney about it now, especially as there's a bit of land lies between two\r\nfarms of mine, and if I don't go spending a lot in follies, I can buy it.\r\nThink of that! I can buy it--_for Horace!_\"\r\n\r\nPercival was guarded in his replies to this and similar outbursts; and Mrs.\r\nMiddleton, seeing that he showed no disposition to toady his grandfather or\r\nto depreciate Horace, told Godfrey Hammond that, though her brother was so\r\nabsurd about him, she thought he seemed a good sort of young man, after\r\nall. \"Time will show,\" was the answer. Now, this was depressing, for\r\nGodfrey had established a reputation for great sagacity.\r\n\r\n[TO BE CONTINUED.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nABBEYS AND CASTLES.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a frequent reflection with the stranger in England that the beauty\r\nand interest of the country are private property, and that to get access to\r\nthem a key is always needed. The key may be large or it may be small, but\r\nit must be something that will turn a lock. Of the things that charm an\r\nAmerican observer in the land of parks and castles, I can think of very few\r\nthat do not come under this definition of private property. When I have\r\nmentioned the hedgerows and the churches I have almost exhausted the list.\r\nYou can enjoy a hedgerow from the public road, and I suppose that even if\r\nyou are a Dissenter you may enjoy a Norman abbey from the street. If,\r\ntherefore, one talks of anything beautiful in England, the presumption will\r\nbe that it is private; and indeed such is my admiration of this delightful\r\ncountry that I feel inclined to say that if one talks of anything private,\r\nthe presumption will be that it is beautiful. Here is something of a\r\ndilemma. If the observer permits himself to commemorate charming\r\nimpressions, he is in danger of giving to the world the fruits of\r\nfriendship and hospitality. If, on the other hand, he withholds his\r\nimpression, he lets something admirable slip away without having marked its\r\npassage, without having done it proper honor. He ends by mingling\r\ndiscretion with enthusiasm, and he says to himself that it is not treating\r\na country ill to talk of its treasures when the mention of each connotes,\r\nas the metaphysicians say, an act of private courtesy.\r\n\r\nThe impressions I have in mind in writing these lines were gathered in a\r\npart of England of which I had not before had even a traveller's glimpse;\r\nbut as to which, after a day or two, I found myself quite ready to agree\r\nwith a friend who lived there, and who knew and loved it well, when he said\r\nvery frankly, \"I _do_ believe it is the loveliest corner of the world!\"\r\nThis was not a dictum to quarrel about, and while I was in the neighborhood\r\nI was quite of his mind. I felt that it would not take a great deal to make\r\nme care for it very much as he cared for it: I had a glimpse of the\r\npeculiar tenderness with which such a country may be loved. It is a capital\r\nexample of the great characteristic of English scenery--of what I should\r\ncall density of feature. There are no waste details; everything in the\r\nlandscape is something particular--has a history, has played a part, has a\r\nvalue to the imagination. It is a country of hills and blue undulations,\r\nand, though none of the hills are high, all of them are\r\ninteresting--interesting as such things are interesting in an old, small\r\ncountry, by a kind of exquisite modulation, something suggesting that\r\noutline and coloring have been retouched and refined, as it were, by the\r\nhand of Time. Independently of its castles and abbeys, the definite relics\r\nof the ages, such a landscape seems historic. It has human relations, and\r\nit is intimately conscious of them. That little speech about the\r\nloveliness of his county, or of his own part of his county, was made to me\r\nby my companion as we walked up the grassy slope of a hill, or \"edge,\" as\r\nit is called there, from the crests of which we seemed in an instant to\r\nlook away over half of England. Certainly I should have grown fond of such\r\na view as that. The \"edge\" plunged down suddenly, as if the corresponding\r\nslope on the other side had been excavated, and one might follow the long\r\nridge for the space of an afternoon's walk with this vast, charming\r\nprospect before one's eyes. Looking across an English county into the next\r\nbut one is a very pretty entertainment, the county seeming by no means so\r\nsmall as might be supposed. How can a county seem small in which, from such\r\na vantage-point as the one I speak of, you see, as a darker patch across\r\nthe lighter green, the twelve thousand acres of Lord So-and-So's woods?\r\nBeyond these are blue undulations of varying tone, and then another\r\nbosky-looking spot, which you learn to be about the same amount of manorial\r\numbrage belonging to Lord Some-One-Else. And to right and left of these, in\r\nshaded stretches, lie other estates of equal consequence. It was therefore\r\nnot the smallness but the vastness of the country that struck me, and I was\r\nnot at all in the mood of a certain American who once, in my hearing, burst\r\nout laughing at an English answer to my inquiry as to whether my\r\ninterlocutor often saw Mr. B----. \"Oh no,\" the answer had been, \"we never\r\nsee him: he lives away off in the West.\" It was the western part of his\r\ncounty our friend meant, and my American humorist found matter for infinite\r\njest in his meaning. \"I should as soon think,\" he declared, \"of saying my\r\nwestern hand and my eastern.\"\r\n\r\nI do not think, even, that my disposition to form a sentimental attachment\r\nfor this delightful region--for its hillside prospect of old red farmhouses\r\nlighting up the dark-green bottoms, of gables and chimney-tops of great\r\nhouses peeping above miles of woodland, and, in the vague places of the\r\nhorizon, of far-away towns and sites that one had always heard of--was\r\nconditioned upon having \"property\" in the neighborhood, so that the little\r\ngirls in the town should suddenly drop courtesies to me in the street;\r\nthough that too would certainly have been pleasant. At the same time,\r\nhaving a little property would without doubt have made the sentiment\r\nstronger. People who wander about the world without money have their\r\ndreams--dreams of what they would buy if their pockets were lined. These\r\ndreams are very apt to have relation to a good estate in any neighborhood\r\nin which the wanderer happens to find himself. For myself, I have never\r\nbeen in a country so unattractive that it did not seem a peculiar felicity\r\nto be able to purchase the most considerable house it contained. In New\r\nEngland and other portions of the United States I have coveted the large\r\nmansion with Greek columns and a pediment of white-painted timber: in Italy\r\nI should have made proposals for the yellow-walled villa with statues on\r\nthe roof. In England I have rarely gone so far as to fancy myself in treaty\r\nfor the best house, but, short of this, I have never failed to feel that\r\nideal comfort for the time would be to call one's self owner of what is\r\ndenominated here a \"good\" place. Is it that English country life seems to\r\npossess such irresistible charms? I have not always thought so: I have\r\nsometimes suspected that it is dull; I have remembered that there is a\r\nwhole literature devoted to exposing it (that of the English novel \"of\r\nmanners\"), and that its recorded occupations and conversations occasionally\r\nstrike one as lacking a certain desirable salt. But, for all that, when, in\r\nthe region to which I allude, my companion spoke of this and that place\r\nbeing likely sooner or later to come to the hammer, it seemed as if nothing\r\ncould be more delightful than to see the hammer fall upon an offer made by\r\none's self. And this in spite of the fact that the owners of the places in\r\nquestion would part with them because they could no longer afford to keep\r\nthem up. I found it interesting to learn, in so far as was possible, what\r\nsort of income was implied by the possession of country-seats such as are\r\nnot in America a concomitant of even the largest fortunes; and if in these\r\ninterrogations I sometimes heard of a very long rent-roll, on the other\r\nhand I was frequently surprised at the slenderness of the resources\r\nattributed to people living in the depths of an oak-studded park. Then,\r\ncertainly, English country life seemed to me the most advantageous thing in\r\nthe world: on these terms one would gladly put up with a little dulness.\r\nWhen I reflected that there were thousands of people dwelling in brownstone\r\nhouses in numbered streets in New York who were at as great a cost to make\r\na reputable appearance in those harsh conditions as some of the occupants\r\nof the grassy estates of which I had a glimpse, the privileges of the\r\nlatter class appeared delightfully cheap.\r\n\r\nThere was one place in particular of which I said to myself that if I had\r\nthe money to buy it, I would simply walk up to the owner and pour the sum\r\nin sovereigns into his hat. I saw this place, unfortunately, to small\r\nadvantage: I saw it in the rain. But I am rather glad that fine weather did\r\nnot meddle with the affair, for I think that in this case the irritation of\r\nenvy would have been really too acute. It was a rainy Sunday, and the rain\r\nwas serious. I had been in the house all day, for the weather can best be\r\ndescribed by my saying that it had been deemed an exoneration from\r\nchurch-going. But in the afternoon, the prospective interval between lunch\r\nand tea assuming formidable proportions, my host took me out to walk, and\r\nin the course of our walk he led me into a park which he described as \"the\r\nparadise of a small English country gentleman.\" Well it might be: I have\r\nnever seen such a collection of oaks. They were of high antiquity and\r\nmagnificent girth and stature: they were strewn over the grassy levels in\r\nextraordinary profusion, and scattered upon and down the slopes in a\r\nfashion than which I have seen nothing more charming since I last looked at\r\nthe chestnut trees on the banks of the Lake of Como. It appears that the\r\nplace was not very vast, but I was unable to perceive its limits. Shortly\r\nbefore we turned into the park the rain had renewed itself, so that we were\r\nawkwardly wet and muddy; but, being near the house, my companion proposed\r\nto leave his card in a neighborly way. The house was most agreeable: it\r\nstood on a kind of terrace in the midst of a lawn and garden, and the\r\nterrace looked down on one of the handsomest rivers in England, and across\r\nto those blue undulations of which I have already spoken. On the terrace\r\nalso was a piece of ornamental water, and there was a small iron paling to\r\ndivide the lawn from the park. All this I beheld in the rain. My companion\r\ngave his card to the butler, with the observation that we were too much\r\nbespattered to come in; and we turned away to complete our circuit. As we\r\nturned away I became acutely conscious of what I should have been tempted\r\nto call the cruelty of this proceeding. My imagination gauged the whole\r\nposition. It was a Sunday afternoon, and it was raining. The house was\r\ncharming, the terrace delightful, the oaks magnificent, the view most\r\ninteresting. But the whole thing was--not to repeat the epithet \"dull,\" of\r\nwhich just now I made too gross a use--the whole thing was quiet. In the\r\nhouse was a drawing-room, and in the drawing-room was--by which I meant\r\n_must be_--a lady, a charming English lady. There was, it seemed to me, no\r\nfatuity in believing that on this rainy Sunday afternoon it would not\r\nplease her to be told that two gentlemen had walked across the country to\r\nher door only to go through the ceremony of leaving a card. Therefore,\r\nwhen, before we had gone many yards, I heard the butler hurrying after us,\r\nI felt how just my sentiment of the situation had been. Of course we went\r\nback, and I carried my muddy shoes into the drawing-room--just the\r\ndrawing-room I had imagined--where I found--I will not say just the lady I\r\nhad imagined, but--a lady even more charming. Indeed, there were two\r\nladies, one of whom was staying in the house. In whatever company you find\r\nyourself in England, you may always be sure that some one present is\r\n\"staying.\" I seldom hear this participle now-a-days without remembering an\r\nobservation made to me in France by a lady who had seen much of English\r\nmanners: \"Ah, that dreadful word _staying!_ I think we are so happy in\r\nFrance not to be able to translate it--not to have any word that answers to\r\nit.\" The large windows of the drawing-room I speak of looked away over the\r\nriver to the blurred and blotted hills, where the rain was drizzling and\r\ndrifting. It was very quiet: there was an air of leisure. If one wanted to\r\ndo something here, there was evidently plenty of time--and indeed of every\r\nother appliance--to do it. The two ladies talked about \"town:\" that is what\r\npeople talk about in the country. If I were disposed I might represent them\r\nas talking about it with a certain air of yearning. At all events, I asked\r\nmyself how it was possible that one should live in this charming place and\r\ntrouble one's head about what was going on in London in July. Then we had\r\nexcellent tea.\r\n\r\nI have narrated this trifling incident because there seemed to be some\r\nconnection between it and what I was going to say about the stranger's\r\nsense of country life being the normal, natural, typical life of the\r\nEnglish. In America, however comfortably people may live in the country,\r\nthere is always, relatively speaking, an air of picnicking about their\r\nestablishments. Their habitations, their arrangements, their appointments,\r\nare more or less provisional. They dine at different hours from their city\r\nhours; they wear different clothing; they spend all their time out of\r\ndoors. The English, on the other hand, live according to the same system in\r\nDevonshire and in Mayfair--with the difference, perhaps, that in\r\nDevonshire, where they have people \"staying\" with them, the system is\r\nrather more rigidly applied. The picnicking, if picnicking there is to be,\r\nis done in town. They keep their best things in the country--their best\r\nbooks, their best furniture, their best pictures--and their footing in\r\nLondon is as provisional as ours is at our \"summer retreats.\" The English\r\nsmile a good deal--or rather would smile a good deal if they had more\r\nobservation of it--at the fashion in which we American burghers stow\r\nourselves away for July and August in white wooden boarding-houses beside\r\ndusty, ill-made roads. But it is fair to say that these improvised homes\r\nare not immeasurably more barbaric than the human _entassement_ that takes\r\nplace in London \"apartments\" during the months of May and June. Whoever has\r\nhad unhappy occasion to look for lodgings at this period, and to explore\r\nthe mysteries of the little black houses in the West End which have a\r\nneatly-printed card suspended in the door-light, will admit that from the\r\nobligation to rough it our more luxurious kinsmen are not altogether\r\nexempt. We rough it, certainly, more than they do, but we rough it in the\r\ncountry, where Nature herself is rough, and they rough it in the heart of\r\nthe largest and most splendid of cities. In England, in the country, Nature\r\nas well as civilization is smooth, and it seems perfectly consistent, even\r\nat midsummer, to dress for dinner; albeit that when so costumed you cannot\r\nconveniently lie on the grass. But in England you do not particularly\r\nexpect to lie on the grass, especially in the evening. The aspect of the\r\nusual English country-houses sufficiently indicates the absence of that\r\ninformal culture of the open air into which the American _villeggiatura_\r\ngenerally resolves itself; and one reason why I mentioned just now the\r\nexcellent dwelling which I visited in the rain was that, as I approached\r\nit, it struck me as so good an example of all that, for American rural\r\npurposes, a house should not be. It was indeed built of stone, or of brick\r\nstuccoed over; which, as they say in England, is a \"great pull.\" But except\r\nthat it was detached and gabled, it belonged quite to the class of city\r\nhouses. Its walls were straight and bare, and its windows, though wide,\r\nwere short. It might have been deposited in Belgravia without in the least\r\nseeming out of place: it conformed to the rigid London model. It had no\r\nexternal galleries, no breezy piazzas, no long windows opening upon them,\r\nno doors disposed for propagating draughts. But, indeed, I have never seen\r\nan English house furnished with what we call a piazza; and I must add that\r\nI have rarely known an English summer day on which it would have been\r\nconvenient to sit in a propagated draught.\r\n\r\nIt seems, however, grossly unthankful to say that English country-houses\r\nlack anything when one has received delightful impressions of what they\r\npossess. What is a draughty doorway to an old Norman portal, massively\r\narched and quaintly sculptured, across whose hollow threshold the eye of\r\nfancy may see the ghosts of monks and the shadows of abbots pass\r\nnoiselessly to and fro? What is a paltry piazza to a beautiful ambulatory\r\nof the thirteenth century--a long stone gallery or cloister repeated in two\r\nstories, with the interstices of its carven lattice now glazed, but with\r\nits long, low, narrow, charming vista still perfect and picturesque--with\r\nits flags worn away by monkish sandals, and with huge round-arched doorways\r\nopening from its inner side into great rooms roofed like cathedrals? What\r\nare the longest French windows, with the most patented latches, to narrow\r\ncasements of almost defensive aspect set in embrasures three feet deep and\r\nornamented with little grotesque mediæval faces? To see one of these small\r\nmonkish masks grinning at you while you dress and undress, or while you\r\nlook up in the intervals of inspiration from your letter-writing, is a\r\nsimple detail in the entertainment of living in an ancient priory. This\r\nentertainment is inexhaustible, for every step you take in such a house\r\nconfronts you in one way or another with the remote past. You feast upon\r\npicturesqueness, you inhale history. Adjoining the house is a beautiful\r\nruin, part of the walls and windows and bases of the piers of the\r\nmagnificent church administered by your predecessor the abbot. These relics\r\nare very desultory, but they are still abundant, and they testify to the\r\ngreat scale and the stately beauty of the abbey. You may lie upon the grass\r\nat the base of an ivied fragment, measure the girth of the great stumps of\r\nthe central columns, half smothered in soft creepers, and think how strange\r\nit is that in this quiet hollow, in the midst of lonely hills, so exquisite\r\nand elaborate a work of art should have arisen. It is but an hour's walk to\r\nanother great ruin, which has held together more completely. There the\r\ncentral tower stands erect to half its altitude, and the round arches and\r\nmassive pillars of the nave make a perfect vista on the unencumbered turf.\r\nYou get an impression that when Catholic England was in her prime great\r\nabbeys were as thick as milestones. By native amateurs, even now, the\r\nregion is called \"wild,\" though to American eyes it seems thoroughly\r\nsuburban in its smoothness and finish. There is a noiseless little railway\r\nrunning through the valley, and there is an ancient little town at the\r\nabbey gates--a town, indeed, with no great din of vehicles, but with goodly\r\nbrick houses, with a dozen \"publics,\" with tidy, whitewashed cottages, and\r\nwith little girls, as I have said, bobbing courtesies in the street. But\r\neven now, if one had wound one's way into the valley by the railroad, it\r\nwould be rather a surprise to find a small ornamental cathedral in a spot\r\non the whole so natural and pastoral. How impressive then must the\r\nbeautiful church have been in the days of its prosperity, when the pilgrim\r\ncame down to it from the grassy hillside and its bells made the stillness\r\nsensible! The abbey was in those days a great affair: as my companion said,\r\nit sprawled all over the place. As you walk away from it you think you have\r\ngot to the end of its traces, but you encounter them still in the shape of\r\na rugged outhouse grand with an Early-English arch, or an ancient well\r\nhidden in a kind of sculptured cavern. It is noticeable that even if you\r\nare a traveller from a land where there are no Early-English--and indeed\r\nfew Late-English--arches, and where the well-covers are, at their hoariest,\r\nof fresh-looking shingles, you grow used with little delay to all this\r\nantiquity. Anything very old seems extremely natural: there is nothing we\r\naccept so implicitly as the past. It is not too much to say that after\r\nspending twenty-four hours in a house that is six hundred years old, you\r\nseem yourself to have lived in it for six hundred years. You seem yourself\r\nto have hollowed the flags with your tread and to have polished the oak\r\nwith your touch. You walk along the little stone gallery where the monks\r\nused to pace, looking out of the Gothic window-places at their beautiful\r\nchurch, and you pause at the big round, rugged doorway that admits you to\r\nwhat is now the drawing-room. The massive step by which you ascend to the\r\nthreshold is a trifle crooked, as it should be: the lintels are cracked and\r\nworn by the myriad-fingered years. This strikes your casual glance. You\r\nlook up and down the miniature cloister before you pass in: it seems\r\nwonderfully old and queer. Then you turn into the drawing-room, where you\r\nfind modern conversation and late publications and the prospect of dinner.\r\nThe new life and the old have melted together: there is no dividing-line.\r\nIn the drawing-room wall is a queer funnel-shaped hole, with the broad end\r\ninward, like a small casemate. You ask a lady what it is, but she doesn't\r\nknow. It is something of the monks: it is a mere detail. After dinner you\r\nare told that there is of course a ghost--a gray friar who is seen in the\r\ndusky hours at the end of passages. Sometimes the servants see him, and\r\nafterward go surreptitiously to sleep in the town. Then, when you take your\r\nchamber-candle and go wandering bedward by a short cut through empty rooms,\r\nyou are conscious of a peculiar sensation which you hardly know whether to\r\ninterpret as a desire to see the gray friar or as an apprehension that you\r\nwill see him.\r\n\r\nA friend of mine, an American, who knew this country, had told me not to\r\nfail, while I was in the neighborhood, to go to S----. \"Edward I. and\r\nElizabeth,\" he said, \"are still hanging about there.\" Thus admonished, I\r\nmade a point of going to S----, and I saw quite what my friend meant.\r\nEdward I. and Elizabeth, indeed, are still to be met almost anywhere in the\r\ncounty: as regards domestic architecture, few parts of England are still\r\nmore vividly Old English. I have rarely had, for a couple of hours, the\r\nsensation of dropping back personally into the past in a higher degree than\r\nwhile I lay on the grass beside the well in the little sunny court of this\r\nsmall castle, and idly appreciated the still definite details of mediæval\r\nlife. The place is a capital example of what the French call a small\r\n_gentilhommière_ of the thirteenth century. It has a good deep moat, now\r\nfilled with wild verdure, and a curious gatehouse of a much later\r\nperiod--the period when the defensive attitude had been wellnigh abandoned.\r\nThis gatehouse, which is not in the least in the style of the habitation,\r\nbut gabled and heavily timbered, with quaint cross-beams protruding from\r\nsurfaces of coarse white stucco, is a very picturesque anomaly in regard to\r\nthe little gray fortress on the other side of the court. I call this a\r\nfortress, but it is a fortress which might easily have been taken, and it\r\nmust have assumed its present shape at a time when people had ceased to\r\npeer through narrow slits at possible besiegers. There are slits in the\r\nouter walls for such peering, but they are noticeably broad and not\r\nparticularly oblique, and might easily have been applied to the uses of a\r\npeaceful parley. This is part of the charm of the place: human life there\r\nmust have lost an earlier grimness: it was lived in by people who were\r\nbeginning to feel comfortable. They must have lived very much together:\r\nthat is one of the most obvious reflections in the court of a mediæval\r\ndwelling. The court was not always grassy and empty, as it is now, with\r\nonly a couple of gentlemen in search of impressions lying at their length,\r\none of whom has taken a wine-flask out of his pocket and has colored the\r\nclear water drawn for them out of the well in a couple of tumblers by a\r\ndecent, rosy, smiling, talking old woman, who has come bustling out of the\r\ngatehouse, and who has a large, dropsical, innocent husband standing about\r\non crutches in the sun and making no sign when you ask after his health.\r\nThis poor man has reached that ultimate depth of human simplicity at which\r\neven a chance to talk about one's ailments is not appreciated. But the\r\ncivil old woman talks for every one, even for an artist who has come out of\r\none of the rooms, where I see him afterward reproducing its mouldering\r\nquaintness. The rooms are all unoccupied and in a state of extreme decay,\r\nthough the castle is, as yet, far from being a ruin. From one of the\r\nwindows I see a young lady sitting under a tree across a meadow, with her\r\nknees up, dipping something into her mouth. It is a camel's hair\r\npaint-brush: the young lady is sketching. These are the only besiegers to\r\nwhich the place is exposed now, and they can do no great harm, as I doubt\r\nwhether the young lady's aim is very good. We wandered about the empty\r\ninterior, thinking it a pity things should be falling so to pieces. There\r\nis a beautiful great hall--great, that is, for a small castle (it would be\r\nextremely handsome in a modern house)--with tall, ecclesiastical-looking\r\nwindows, and a long staircase at one end climbing against the wall into a\r\nspacious bedroom. You may still apprehend very well the main lines of that\r\nsimpler life; and it must be said that, simpler though it was, it was\r\napparently by no means destitute of many of our own conveniences. The\r\nchamber at the top of the staircase ascending from the hall is charming\r\nstill, with its irregular shape, its low-browed ceiling, its cupboards in\r\nthe walls, and its deep bay window formed of a series of small lattices.\r\nYou can fancy people stepping out from it upon the platform of the\r\nstaircase, whose rugged wooden logs, by way of steps, and solid,\r\ndeeply-guttered hand-rail, still remain. They looked down into the hall,\r\nwhere, I take it, there was always a certain congregation of retainers,\r\nmuch lounging and waiting and passing to and fro, with a door open into the\r\ncourt. The court, as I said just now, was not the grassy, æsthetic spot\r\nwhich you may find it at present of a summer's day: there were beasts\r\ntethered in it, and hustling men-at-arms, and the earth was trampled into\r\npuddles. But my lord or my lady, looking down from the chamber-door, could\r\npick out the man wanted and bawl down an order, with a threat to fling\r\nsomething at his head if it were not instantly performed. The sight of the\r\ngroups on the floor beneath, the calling up and down, the oaken tables\r\nspread, and the brazier in the middle,--all this seemed present again; and\r\nit was not difficult to pursue the historic vision through the rest of the\r\nbuilding--through the portion which connected the great hall with the tower\r\n(here the confederate of the sketching young lady without had set up the\r\npeaceful three-legged engine of his craft); through the dusky, roughly\r\ncircular rooms of the tower itself, and up the corkscrew staircase of the\r\nsame to that most charming part of every old castle, where visions must\r\nleap away off the battlements to elude you--the sunny, breezy platform at\r\nthe tower-top, the place where the castle-standard hung and the vigilant\r\ninmates surveyed the approaches. Here, always, you really overtake the\r\nimpression of the place--here, in the sunny stillness, it seems to pause,\r\npanting a little, and give itself up.\r\n\r\nIt was not only at Stokesay--I have written the name at last, and I will\r\nnot efface it--that I lingered a while on the quiet platform of the keep to\r\nenjoy the complete impression so overtaken. I spent such another half hour\r\nat Ludlow, which is a much grander and more famous monument. Ludlow,\r\nhowever, is a ruin--the most impressive and magnificent of ruins. The\r\ncharming old town and the admirable castle form a capital object of\r\npilgrimage. Ludlow is an excellent example of a small English provincial\r\ntown that has not been soiled and disfigured by industry: I remember there\r\nno tall chimneys and smoke-streamers, with their attendant purlieus and\r\nslums. The little city is perched upon a hill near which the goodly Severn\r\nwanders, and it has a noticeable air of civic dignity. Its streets are wide\r\nand clean, empty and a little grass-grown, and bordered with spacious,\r\nsoberly-ornamental brick houses, which look as if there had been more going\r\non in them in the first decade of the century than there is in the present,\r\nbut which can still, nevertheless, hold up their heads and keep their\r\nwindow-panes clear, their knockers brilliant and their doorsteps whitened.\r\nThe place looks as if seventy years ago it had been the centre of a large\r\nprovincial society, and as if that society had been very \"good of its\r\nkind.\" It must have transported itself to Ludlow for the season--in\r\nrumbling coaches and heavyish curricles--and there entertained itself in\r\ndecent emulation of that metropolis which a choice of railway-lines had not\r\nas yet placed within its immediate reach. It had balls at the\r\nassembly-rooms; it had Mrs. Siddons to play; it had Catalani to sing. Miss\r\nAustin's and Miss Edgeworth's heroines might perfectly well have had their\r\nfirst love-affair there: a journey to Ludlow would certainly have been a\r\ngreat event to Fanny Price or Anne Eliot, to Helen or Belinda. It is a\r\nplace on which a provincial \"gentry\" has left a sensible stamp. I have\r\nseldom seen so good a collection of houses of the period between the elder\r\npicturesqueness and the modern baldness. Such places, such houses, such\r\nrelics and intimations, always carry me back to the near antiquity of that\r\npre-Victorian England which it is still easy for a stranger to picture with\r\na certain vividness, thanks to the partial survival of many of its\r\ncharacteristics. It is still easy for a stranger who has stayed a while in\r\nEngland to form an idea of the tone, the habits, the aspect of English\r\nsocial life before its classic insularity had begun to wane, as all\r\nobservers agree that it did, about thirty years ago. It is true that the\r\nmental operation in this matter reduces itself to fancying some of the\r\nthings which form what Mr. Matthew Arnold would call the peculiar \"notes\"\r\nof England infinitely exaggerated--the rigidly aristocratic constitution of\r\nsociety, for instance; the unæsthetic temper of the people; the private\r\ncharacter of most kinds of comfort and entertainment. Let an old gentleman\r\nof conservative tastes, who can remember the century's youth, talk to you\r\nat a club _temporis acti_--tell you wherein it is that from his own point\r\nof view London, as a residence for a gentleman, has done nothing but fall\r\noff for the last forty years. You will listen, of course, with an air of\r\ndecent sympathy, but privately you will be saying to yourself how\r\ndifficult a place of sojourn London must have been in those days for a\r\nstranger--how little cosmopolitan, how bound, in a thousand ways, with\r\nnarrowness of custom. What is true of the metropolis at that time is of\r\ncourse doubly true of the provinces; and a genteel little city like the one\r\nI am speaking of must have been a kind of focus of insular propriety. Even\r\nthen, however, the irritated alien would have had the magnificent ruins of\r\nthe castle to dream himself back into good-humor in. They would effectually\r\nhave transported him beyond all waning or waxing Philistinisms.\r\n\r\nLudlow Castle is an example of a great feudal fortress, as the little\r\ncastellated manor I spoke of a while since is an example of a small one.\r\nThe great courtyard at Ludlow is as large as the central square of a city,\r\nbut now it is all vacant and grassy, and the day I was there a lonely old\r\nhorse was tethered and browsing in the middle of it. The place is in\r\nextreme dilapidation, but here and there some of its more striking features\r\nhave held well together, and you may get a very sufficient notion of the\r\nimmense scale upon which things were ordered in the day of its strength. It\r\nmust have been garrisoned with a small army, and the vast _enceinte_ must\r\nhave enclosed a stalwart little world. Such an impression of thickness and\r\nduskiness as one still gets from fragments of partition and chamber--such a\r\nsense of being well behind something, well out of the daylight and its\r\ndangers--of the comfort of the time having been security, and security\r\nincarceration! There are prisons within the prison--horrible unlighted\r\ncaverns of dismal depth, with holes in the roof through which Heaven knows\r\nwhat odious refreshment was tossed down to the poor groping _détenu_. There\r\nis nothing, surely, that paints one side of the Middle Ages more vividly\r\nthan this fact that fine people lived in the same house with their\r\nprisoners, and kept the key in their pocket. Fancy the young ladies of the\r\nfamily working tapestry in their \"bower\" with the knowledge that at the\r\nbottom of the corkscrew staircase one of their papa's enemies was sitting\r\nmonth after month in mouldy midnight! But Ludlow Castle has brighter\r\nassociations than these, the chief of which I should have mentioned at the\r\noutset. It was for a long period the official residence of the\r\ngovernors--the \"lords presidents\" they were called--of the Marches of\r\nWales, and it was in the days of its presidential splendor that Milton's\r\n_Comus_ was acted in the great hall. Wandering about in shady corners of\r\nthe ruin, it is the echo of that enchanting verse that we should try to\r\ncatch, and not the faint groans of some encaverned malefactor. Other verse\r\nwas also produced at Ludlow--verse, however, of a less sonorous quality. A\r\nportion of Samuel Butler's _Hudibras_ was composed there. Let me add that\r\nthe traveller who spends a morning at Ludlow will naturally have come\r\nthither from Shrewsbury, of which place I have left myself no space to\r\nspeak, though it is worth, and well worth, an allusion. Shrewsbury is a\r\nmuseum of beautiful old gabled, cross-timbered house-fronts.\r\n\r\nH. JAMES, JR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLITTLE LIZAY.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlston was a Virginia slave--a tall, well-built half-breed, in whom the\r\nwhite blood dominated the black. When about thirty-seven years of age he\r\nwas sold to a Mississippi plantation, in the north-western part of the\r\nState and on the river. The farm was managed by an overseer, the\r\nmaster--Horton by name--being a practising physician in Memphis, Tenn.\r\nAlston had been on the plantation a few weeks when, toward the last of\r\nSeptember, the cotton-picking season opened. The year had been, for the\r\nriver-plantations, exceptionally favorable for cotton-growing. On the\r\nHorton place especially \"the stand\" had been pronounced perfect, there\r\nbeing scarcely a gap, scarcely a stalk missing from the mile-long rows of\r\nthe broad fields. Then, the rainfall had not been so profuse as to develop\r\nfoliage at the bolls' expense, as was too frequently the case on the river.\r\nYet it had been plenteous enough to keep off the \"rust,\" from which the\r\ndryer upland plantations were now suffering. Neither the \"boll-worm\" nor\r\nthe dreaded \"army-worm\" had molested the river-fields; so the tall\r\npyramidal plants were thickly set with \"squares\" and green egg-shaped\r\nbolls, smooth and shining as with varnish. On a single stalk might be seen\r\nall stages of development--from the ripe, brown boll, parted starlike, with\r\nthe long white fleece depending, to the bean-sized embryo from which the\r\ncrimson flower had but just fallen. Indeed, among the wide-open bolls there\r\nwas an occasional flower, cream-hued or crimson according to its age, for\r\nthe cotton-bloom at opening resembles in color the magnolia-blossom, but\r\nthis changes quickly to a deep crimson.\r\n\r\nThere was, then, the promise, almost the certainty, of a heavy crop on the\r\nHorton place. It was in view of this that the owner completed an\r\narrangement, for months under consideration, in which he increased his\r\nworking plantation-force by thirteen hands, of whom one was Alston. It was,\r\ntoo, in view of this promised heavy crop that the overseer, Mr. Buck,\r\nharangued the slaves at the opening of the picking-season. The burden of\r\nhis harangue was, that no flagging would be tolerated in cotton-gathering\r\nduring the season. The figures of the past year were on record, showing\r\nwhat each hand did each day. There was to be no falling behind these\r\nfigures: indeed, they must be beaten, for the heavier bolling made the\r\npicking easier. Any one falling behind was to be cowhided. As for the new\r\nhands, they ought to lead the field, for they were all young, stout\r\nfellows.\r\n\r\nAs has been said, Alston was tall, strong, well-made. Working in tobacco,\r\nto whose culture he had been used, he could hold his hand with the best:\r\nhow would it be in this new business of cotton-picking? He had a strong\r\nelement of cheerful fidelity in his nature. The first day he worked\r\nsteadily and as rapidly as he was able at the unfamiliar employment. When\r\nnight came he reckoned he had done well. With a complacent feeling he stood\r\nwaiting his turn as the great baskets, one after another, were swung on the\r\nsteelyard and the weights announced. He found himself pitying some of the\r\npickers as light weights were called, wondering if they had fallen behind\r\nlast year's figures. When his basket was brought forward, it was by Big\r\nSam, who with one hand swung it lightly to the scales; yet Alston's thought\r\nwas, \"How strong Big Sam is!\" and never, \"How light the basket!\"\r\n\r\nThe weight was announced: Alston was almost stunned. He had strained every\r\nnerve, yet here he was behind the children-pickers, behind the gray old\r\nwomen stiff with rheumatism and broken with childbearing and with doing\r\nmen's work.\r\n\r\n\"Sixty-three pounds!\" the overseer said with a threatening tone. \"Min' yer\r\ngit a heap higher'n that ter-morrer, yer yaller raskel! Ef yer can't pick\r\ncotton, yer'll be sol' down in Louzany to a sugar-plantation, whar' niggers\r\ndon't git nothin' ter eat 'cept cotton-seeds an' a few dreggy lasses.\"\r\n\r\nNext to being sent to \"the bad place\" itself, the most terrible fate, to\r\nthe negro's imagination, was to be sold to a sugar-planter.\r\n\r\n\"Here's Big Sam,\" the overseer continued, \"nigh unto three hunderd; an'\r\nLittle Lizay two hunderd an' fawty-seven.--That's the bigges' figger yer's\r\never struck yit, Lizay: shows what yer kin do. Min' yer come up ter it\r\nter-morrer an' ev'ry other day.\"\r\n\r\n\"Days gits shawter 'bout Chrismus-time,\" Little Lizay ventured to suggest,\r\n\"an' it gits col', an' my fingers ain't limber.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't give me none yer jaw. Reckon I knows 'nuff ter make 'lowances fer\r\ncol' an' shawt days an' scatterin' bolls an' sich like.\"\r\n\r\nThe next day, Alston, humiliated by his failure and by the brutal reprimand\r\nhe had received, went to the cotton-field before any of the other\r\nhands--indeed, before it was fairly light. There he worked if ever a man\r\ndid work. When the other negroes came on the field there were laughing,\r\ntalking, singing, nodding and occasional napping in the shade of the\r\ncotton-stalks. But Alston took no part in any of these. He had no interest\r\nfor anything apart from his work. At this all his faculties were engaged.\r\nHis lithe body was seen swaying from side to side about the widespreading\r\nbranches; he stood on tiptoe to reach the topmost bolls; he got on his\r\nknees to work the base-limbs, pressing down and away the long grass with\r\nhis broad feet, tearing and holding back even with his teeth hindering\r\ntendrils of the passion-flower and morning-glory and other creepers which\r\nhad escaped the devastating hoe when the crop was \"laid by,\" and had made\r\ngood their hold on occasional stalks. Persistently he worked in this intent\r\nway all through the hot day, every muscle in action. He lingered at the\r\nwork till after the last of the other pickers had with great baskets poised\r\non head joined the long, weird procession, showing white in the dusk, that\r\nwent winding through field and lane to the ginhouse. On he worked till the\r\ncrescent moon came up and he could hardly discern fleece from leaf. At\r\nlast, fearing that the basket-weighing might be ended before he could reach\r\nthe ginhouse, a half mile distant, he emptied his pick-sack, belted at his\r\nwaist, into the tall barrel-like basket, tramped the cotton with a few\r\nmovements of his bare feet, and then kneeling got the basket to his\r\nshoulder: he was not used to the balancing on head which seemed natural as\r\nbreathing to the old hands. With long strides he hurried to the ginhouse.\r\nHe was not a minute too early. Almost the last basket had been weighed,\r\nemptied and stacked when he climbed the ladder-like steps to the scaffold\r\nwhere the cotton was sunned preparatory to its ginning. When he had pushed\r\nhis way through the crowd of negroes hanging about the door of the\r\nginhouse-loft he heard the overseer call, \"Whar's that yaller whelp,\r\nAls'on?\"\r\n\r\n\"Here, sah,\" Alston answered, hurrying forward to put his basket on the\r\nsteelyard.\r\n\r\n\"Give me any mo' yer jaw an' I'll lay yer out with the butt-en' er this\r\nwhip,\" said Mr. Buck. Alston was wondering what he had said that was\r\ndisrespectful, when the man added, \"Won't have none yer sahrin' uv me. I's\r\nyer moster, an' that's what yer's got ter call me, I let yer know.\"\r\n\r\nAlston's blood was up, but the slaves were used to self-repression. All\r\nthat was endurable in their lives depended on patience and submission.\r\n\r\n\"Beg poddon, moster,\" Alston said with well-assumed meekness. \"In Ol'\r\nVirginny we use ter say moster to jist our sho'-'nuff owners; but,\" he\r\nadded quickly, by way of mollifying the overseer, who could not fail to be\r\nstung by the covert jeer, \"it's a heap better ter say moster ter all the\r\nwhite folks, white trash an' all: then yer's sho' ter be right.\"\r\n\r\nAt this speech there was in Mr. Buck's rear much grinning and eye-rolling.\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Buck was engaged with Alston's basket, which was now on the scales.\r\n\"Sixty-seven poun's,\" the overseer called.\r\n\r\nThe slave's heart sank: only four pounds' gain after all his toil early and\r\nlate! He was bitterly disappointed. He believed the overseer lied. Then his\r\nheart burned. Couldn't he leave his basket unemptied, and weigh it himself\r\nwhen the others were gone? No: the order of routine was peremptory. The\r\nbaskets must be emptied and stacked on the scaffold outside the\r\ncotton-loft, so that there would be no chance the next morning for the\r\nnegroes to take away cotton in their baskets to the fields. And what if he\r\ncould reweigh his cotton, and prove Mr. Buck a liar? He would not dare\r\nbreathe the discovery.\r\n\r\nSo Alston emptied out the cotton he had worked so hard to gather, listening\r\nmoodily to the overseer's harsh threats: \"Yer reckon I's goin' to stan'\r\nsich figgers? Sixty-seven poun's! fou' poun's 'head uv yistiddy. Yer ought\r\nter be fawty ahead. I won't look at nothin' under a hunderd. Ef yer don't\r\nget it ter-morrer I'll tie yer up, sho's yer bawn, yer great merlatto dog!\r\nYer's 'hin' the poo'es' gal in the fiel'.\"\r\n\r\n\"I never pick no cotton 'fo' yistiddy, an' its tolerbul unhandy. Rickon I\r\nkin do better when I gits my han' in. I use ter could wuck fus'-rate in\r\ntobaccy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tobaccy won't save yer. We hain't got no use for niggers ef they can't\r\ncome up ter the scratch on cotton. I's made a big crop, an' I ain't goin'\r\nter let it rot in the fiel'. Yer ought ter pick three hunderd ev'ry day. I\r\nknow'd a nigger onct, a heap littler than Little Lizay, that picked five\r\nhunderd ev'ry lick; an' I hearn tell uv a feller that went up ter seven\r\nhunderd. I ain't goin' ter take no mo' sixties from yer: a good hunderd or\r\nthe cowhide. That's the talk!\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll pick all I kin,\" said Alston: \"I wuckt haud's I could ter-day.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ef yer don't hush yer lyin' mouth I'll cut yer heart out.\"\r\n\r\nAlston went from the gin-loft, his blood tingling. On the sunning-scaffold\r\nhe encountered Little Lizay. She had been listening--had heard all that had\r\npassed between the two men. She went down the scaffold-steps, and Alston\r\ncame soon after. She waited for him, and they walked to the \"quarter\"\r\ntogether. \"It's mighty haud, ain't it?\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"I believe he tol' a lie 'bout my baskit. Anyhow, I wuckt haud's I could\r\nter-day. I can't pick no hunderd poun's uv the flimpsy stuff. He'll have\r\nter cowhide me: I don't kere.\"\r\n\r\nBut Alston did care keenly--not so much for the pain; he could bear worse\r\nmisery than the brutal arm could inflict, though the rawhide cut like a\r\ndull knife; but it was the shame, the disgrace, of the thing. He was a\r\nstranger on the place--only a few weeks there--and to be tied up and\r\nflogged in the midst of strange, unsympathizing negroes! it was such\r\ndegradation to his manhood. Since he was a child he had not been struck. He\r\nhad been rather a favorite with his master in Virginia, but this master had\r\ndied in debt, leaving numerous heirs, and in the changes incident to a\r\npartition of the estate Alston was sold.\r\n\r\nPerceiving that he had Little Lizay's sympathy, Alston went on talking,\r\ntelling her that he could stand a lashing coming from his own master, but\r\nthat an overseer was only white trash, who never did \"own a nigger,\" and\r\nnever would be able to. If he had to be flogged, he wanted it to be by a\r\ngentleman.\r\n\r\n\"Never min',\" said Little Lizay. \"Maybe yer'll git mo' ter-morrer. When\r\nyer's pickin' yer mus' quit stoppin' ter pick out the leaves an' trash. I\r\nlets ev'rything go in that happens, green bolls an' all: they weighs\r\nheavy.\"\r\n\r\nThe following day, Alston, as before, went to the cotton-field early, but\r\nhe found that Little Lizay had the start of him. She had already emptied\r\nher sack into her pick-basket. \"The cotton we get now'll weigh heavy,\" she\r\nsaid: \"it's got dew on it.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's so,\" Alston assented, \"but yer mus'n't talk ter me, Lizay. I's got\r\nter put all my min' ter my wuck: I can't foad ter talk.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't nuther,\" said Lizay. \"Wish I didn't pick so much cotton the fus'\r\nday: I's got ter keep on trottin' ter two hunderd an' fawty-seven.\"\r\n\r\nShe selected two rows beside Alston's. She wore a coarse dress of uncolored\r\nhomespun cotton, of the plainest and scantiest make, low in the neck, short\r\nin the sleeves and skirt. Her feet and head were bare. A sack of like\r\nmaterial with her dress was tied about the waist, apron-like. This was to\r\nreceive immediately the pickings from the hand. When filled it was emptied\r\nin a pick-basket, holding with a little packing fifty or sixty pounds. This\r\nsmall basket was kept in the picker's vicinity, being moved forward\r\nwhenever the sack was taken back for emptying. Besides this go-between\r\npick-basket, there was at that end of the row nearest the ginhouse an\r\nimmense basket, nearly as tall as a barrel, and of greater circumference,\r\nwith a capacity for three hundred pounds.\r\n\r\nAlston's pick-basket stood beside Little Lizay's, and between his row and\r\nhers. She was carrying two rows to his one, and he perceived, without\r\nlooking and with a vague envy, that Lizay emptied three sacks at least to\r\nhis one. Yet she did not seem to be working half as hard as he was. With\r\nlight, graceful movements, now right, now left, she plucked the white tufts\r\nand the candelabra-like pendants stretched by the wind and the expanding\r\nlint till the dark seed could be discerned in clusters.\r\n\r\nIt was near nine o'clock when Alston emptied his first sack, some fifteen\r\npounds, in the pick-basket, which Little Lizay had brought forward with her\r\nown. Soon after she went back to empty her sack. The baskets stood\r\nhazardously near Alston for Lizay's game, but with her back turned to him\r\nand the luxuriant cotton-stalks between she reckoned she might venture.\r\nOne-third of her sack she threw into Alston's basket--about five pounds.\r\nAnd thus the poor soul did during the day, giving a third of her gatherings\r\nto Alston. She would have given him more--the half, the whole, everything\r\nshe owned--for she regarded him with a feeling that would have been called\r\nlove in a fairer woman.\r\n\r\nAlston had been in Virginia something of a house-servant, doing occasional\r\nduty as coachman when the regular official was ill or was wanted elsewhere.\r\nHe was also a good table-waiter, and had served in the dining-room when\r\nthere were guests. So it came that though properly a field-hand, yet in\r\nmanner and speech he showed to advantage beside the slaves who were\r\nexclusively field-hands. Little Lizay too occupied a halfway place between\r\nthese and the better-spoken, gentler-mannered house-servants. In the\r\nwinters, after Christmas, which usually terminated the picking-season,\r\nLizay was called to the place of head assistant of the plantation\r\nseamstress. Indeed, she did little field-service except in times of special\r\npressure and during the quarter of cotton-picking. She was so\r\nnimble-fingered and swift that she could not be spared from the field in\r\npicking-season, especially if, as was the case this year, there was a heavy\r\ncrop. And occasionally in the winter, when there was unusual company at the\r\nHortons' in the city, Little Lizay was sent for and had the advantage of a\r\nseason in town. She felt her superiority to the average plantation-negro,\r\nand had not married, though not unsolicited. When, therefore, Alston came\r\nshe at once recognized in him a companion, and she was not long in making\r\nover her favor to the distinguished-looking stranger. He was, as she, a\r\nhalf-breed, and Lizay liked her own color. Had Alston courted her favor,\r\nshe might have yielded it less readily, but he did not take easily to his\r\nnew companions. Some called him proud: others reckoned he had left a\r\nsweetheart, a wife perhaps, in Virginia. Little Lizay's evident preference\r\nlaid her open to the rude jokes and sneers of the other negroes--in\r\nparticular Big Sam, who was her suitor, and Edny Ann, who was fond of\r\nAlston. But Edny Ann did not care for Alston as Little Lizay did--could\r\nnot, indeed. She was incapable of the devotion that Lizay felt. She would\r\nnot have left her sleep and gone to the dew-wet field before daybreak for\r\nthe sake of helping Alston: she would not have taken the risk of falling\r\nbehind in her picking, and thus incurring a flogging, by dividing her\r\ngatherings with him. And if she had helped him at all, it would not have\r\nbeen delicately, as Lizay's help had been given. Edny Ann would have wanted\r\nAlston to know that she had helped him: Little Lizay wished to hide it from\r\nhim, both because she feared he would decline her help, and because she\r\nwanted to spare him the humiliation.\r\n\r\nWhen night came not only Alston lingered, picking by moonlight, but Little\r\nLizay; and this gave rise to much laughing among the other pickers, and to\r\nmany coarse jokes. But to one who knew her secret it would have seemed\r\npiteous--the girl's anxious face as the weighing proceeded, drawing on and\r\non to Alston's basket and hers at the very end of the line. Would he have\r\na hundred? would she fall behind? Would he be saved the flogging? would she\r\nhave to suffer in his stead? She dreaded a flogging at the hands of that\r\nbrutal overseer, and all her womanliness shrunk from the degradation of\r\nbeing stripped and flogged in Alston's presence, or even of having him know\r\nthat she was to be cowhided. She bethought her of making an appeal to the\r\noverseer. She knew she had some power with him, for he had been enamored,\r\nin his brutish way, of her physical charms--her neat figure, her glossy,\r\nwaving hair, and the small, shapely hand and foot.\r\n\r\nJust before the weighing had reached Alston's basket and hers she stepped\r\nbeside the overseer. \"Please, Mos' Buck,\" she said in a low tone, \"ef I\r\nfalls 'hin' myse'f, an' don't git up to them fus' figgers, an' has to git\r\ncowhided--please, sah, don't let the black folks an' Als'on know 'bout it.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Buck took a hint from this request. He perceived that Lizay was\r\ninterested in Alston, as he had already guessed from the jokes of the\r\nnegroes, and that she was specially desirous to conceal her shame from the\r\nman to whom she had given her favor. Mr. Buck resented it that Lizay should\r\nrebuff him and encourage Alston; so he hoped that for this once, at any\r\nrate, she would fall behind: he had thought of a capital plan of revenging\r\nhimself on her.\r\n\r\nThe next moment after her whispered appeal Lizay saw with intense interest\r\nAlston's basket brought forward for weighing. She glanced at him. His eyes\r\nwere wide open, staring with eagerness, his head advanced, his whole\r\nattitude one of absorbed anxiety. By the position of the weight or pea on\r\nthe steelyard she knew that it was put somewhere near the sixty notch. Up\r\nflew the end of the yard, and up flew Lizay's heart with it: out went the\r\npea some ten teeth, yet up again went the impatient steel. Click! click!\r\nclick! rattled the weight. Out and out another ten notches, then another\r\nand another--one hundred, one hundred and one, one hundred and two, one\r\nhundred and three--yet the yard still protested, still called for more.\r\nOut one tooth farther, and the steel lay along the horizon. Everybody\r\nlistened.\r\n\r\n\"One hunderd an' fou',\" Mr. Buck announced. \"Thar' now, yer lazy dog! I\r\nknow'd yer wasn't half wuckin'. Now see ter it yer come ter taw arter this:\r\nhunderd an' fou's yer notch.\"\r\n\r\nIt was a moment of supreme relief to Alston. He drew a long breath, and\r\nreturned some smiles of congratulation from the negroes. Then he sighed: he\r\nfelt hopeless of repeating the weight day after day. He had hardly stopped\r\nto breathe from day-dawn till moon-rise: he would not always have the\r\nfriendly moonlight to help him. But now Little Lizay's basket was swinging.\r\nHe listened to hear its weight with interest, but how unlike this was to\r\nthe absorbed anxiety which she had felt for him!\r\n\r\n\"Two hunderd an' 'leven--thutty-six poun's behin'!\" said Mr. Buck, smacking\r\nhis lips as over some good thing. Now he should have vent for his spite\r\nagainst the girl. \"Thutty-six lashes on yer bar' back by yer sweet'art.\"\r\nMr. Buck said this with a dreadful snicker in Little Lizay's face.\r\n\r\nThe word ran like wildfire from mouth to mouth that Little Lizay, the\r\nfamous picker, had fallen behind, and was to be flogged--by the overseer,\r\nsome said--by Big Sam, others declared. But Edny Ann reckoned the cowhiding\r\nwas to be done by Alston.\r\n\r\n\"An' her dersarves it, kase her's a big fool,\" said Edny Ann, \"hangin'\r\nroun' him, an' patchin' his cloze like her wus morred ter 'im--an' washin'\r\nhis shut an' britches ev'ry Saddy night.\"\r\n\r\nAll the hands were required to stop after the weighing and witness the\r\nfloggings, as a warning to themselves and an enhancement of punishment to\r\nthe convicts. There was but little shrinking from the sight. Human nature\r\nis everywhere much the same: cruel spectacles brutalize, whether in Spain\r\nor on a negro-plantation. But to-night there was a new sensation: the\r\nslaves were on the _qui vive_ to see Little Lizay flogged, and to find out\r\nwhose hand was to wield the whip.\r\n\r\n\"Now hurry up yere, yer lazy raskels! an' git yer floggin',\" Mr. Buck said\r\nwhen the weighing was over.\r\n\r\nFrom right and left and front and rear negroes came forward and stood, a\r\nmotley group, before the one white man. It was a weird spectacle that did\r\nnot seem to belong to our earth. Black faces, heads above heads, crowded at\r\nthe doorway--some solemn and sympathetic, others grinning in anticipation\r\nof the show. Negroes were perched on the gin and in the corners of the loft\r\nwhere the cotton was heaped. Others lay at full length close to the field\r\nof action. In every direction the dusky figures dotted the cotton lying on\r\nevery hand about the little cleared space where the flogging and weighing\r\nwere done. In a close bunch stood the shrinking, cowering convicts, some\r\nwith heads white as the cotton all about them. Mr. Buck, the most\r\npicturesque figure of the whole, was laying off his coat and baring his\r\narm, standing under the solitary lamp depending from the rafters, whose\r\nfaint light served to give to all the scene an indefinite supernatural\r\naspect.\r\n\r\n\"Now, come out yere,\" said Mr. Buck, moving from under the grease-lamp and\r\ncalling for volunteers.\r\n\r\nOne by one the negroes came forward and bared themselves to the\r\nwaist--children, strong men and old women. And then there was shrieking and\r\nwailing, begging and praying: it was like a leaf out of hell.\r\n\r\nLittle Lizay was among the first of the condemned to present herself, for\r\nshe felt an intolerable suspense as to what awaited her. The vague terror\r\nin her face was discerned by the dim light.\r\n\r\nAs she stepped forward Mr. Buck called out, \"Als'on!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, moster,\" Alston answered.\r\n\r\n\"What yer sneakin' in that thar' corner fer? Come up yere, you--\" but his\r\nvile sentence shall not be finished here.\r\n\r\nAlston came forward with a statuesque face.\r\n\r\n\"Take this rawhide,\" was the order he received.\r\n\r\nHe put out his hand, and then, suddenly realizing the requisition that was\r\nto be made on him, realizing that he was to flog Little Lizay, his\r\nconfidante and sympathizing friend, his hand dropped cold and limp.\r\n\r\n\"Yerdar' ter dis'bey me?\" Mr. Buck bellowed. \"I'll brain yer: I'll--\"\r\n\r\n\"I didn't go ter do it, moster,\" Alston said, reaching for the whip. \"I'll\r\nwhip her tell yer tells me ter stop.\"\r\n\r\n\"He didn't go ter do it, Mos' Buck,\" pleaded Little Lizay, frightened for\r\nAlston. \"He'll whip me ef yer'll give 'im the whip.--I's ready, Als'on.\"\r\n\r\nShe crossed her arms over her bare bosom and shook her long hair forward:\r\nthen dropped her face low and stood with her back partly turned to Alston,\r\nwho now had the whip.\r\n\r\n\"Fire away!\" said the overseer.\r\n\r\nAlston was not a refined gentleman, whose youth had been hedged from the\r\ncoarse and degrading, whose good instincts had been cherished, whose\r\nfaculties had been harmoniously trained. He was not a hero: he was not\r\nprepared to espouse to the death Little Lizay's cause--to risk everything\r\nfor the shrinking, helpless woman and for his own manhood--to die rather\r\nthan strike her. He was only a slave, used from his cradle to the low and\r\ncruel and brutalizing. But he had the making of a man in him: his nature\r\nwas one that could never become utterly base. But there was no help, no\r\nhope, for either of them in anything he could do. He might knock Mr. Buck\r\nsenseless, sure of the sympathy of every slave on the plantation. There\r\nwould be a brief triumph, but he and Little Lizay would have to pay for it:\r\nbloodhounds, scourgings, chains, cruelty that never slept and could never\r\nbe placated, were sure as fate. Resistance was inevitable disaster.\r\n\r\nAlston did not need to stand there undetermined while he went over this: it\r\nwas familiar ground. Over and over again he had settled it: it was madness\r\nfor the slave to oppose himself to the dominant white man.\r\n\r\nSo, after his first unreasoning recoil, his mind was decided to adminster\r\nthe flogging. Would it not be a mercy to Little Lizay for him to do this\r\nrather than that other hand, energized by hate, revenge and cruelty?\r\n\r\nHe raised his arm, with his heart beating hot and his manhood shrinking: he\r\nstruck Little Lizay's bare shoulders. She had nerved herself, but the blow,\r\nafter all, surprised her and made her start; and she had not quite\r\nrecovered herself when the second blow fell, so that she winced again; but\r\nafter that she stood like a statue.\r\n\r\n\"Harder!\" cried Mr. Buck after the first few lashes. \"None yer tomfool'ry\r\n'bout me. She ain't no baby. Harder! I tell yer. Yer ain't draw'd no blood\r\nnary time. Ef yer don't min' me I'll knock yer down. Yer whips like yer wus\r\n'feard yer'd hurt 'er. Yer ac' like yer never whipped no nigger sence yer\r\nwus bawn. Yer's got ter tiptoe ter it, an' fling yer arm back at a better\r\nlick 'an that. Look yere: ef yer don't lick her harder I'll make Big Sam\r\nlick yer till yer see sights.\"\r\n\r\nAt length the wretched work was ended, and the negroes made their way along\r\nthe moonlighted lanes to their cabins. These were single rooms, built of\r\nunhewn logs, chinked and daubed with yellow mud. They had puncheon floors\r\nand chimneys built of sticks and clay. Of clay also were the all-important\r\njambs, which served as depositories of perhaps every household article\r\npertaining to the cabin except the bedding and the stools. There might have\r\nbeen found the household knife and spoon, the two or three family tin cups,\r\nthe skillet, the pothooks, sundry gourd vessels, the wooden tray in which\r\nthe \"cawn\" bread was mixed--pipe, tobacco and banjo.\r\n\r\nOn the Horton place the negroes cooked their own suppers after the day's\r\nwork was over. So for an hour every evening \"the quarter\" had an animated\r\naspect, for the cabins, standing five yards apart, faced each other in two\r\nlong lines. In each was a glowing fire, on which logs and pine-knots and\r\ncypress-splints were laid with unsparing hand, for there was no limit to\r\nthe fuel. These fires furnished the lights: candles and lamps were unknown\r\nat \"the quarter.\"\r\n\r\nOf course the windowless cabins, with these roaring fires, were stifling\r\nin September; so the negroes sat in the doorways chatting and singing while\r\nthe bacon was frying and the corn dough roasting in the ashes or the\r\nhoecake baking on the griddle. An occasional woman patched or washed some\r\ngarment by the firelight, while others brought water in piggins from the\r\nspring at the foot of the hill on whose brow \"the quarter\" was located.\r\n\r\nAs Alston sat outside his door on a block, eating his supper by the light\r\nof the high-mounting flames of his cabin-fire, Little Lizay came out and\r\nsat on her doorsill. Her cabin stood opposite his. He recognized her, and\r\nwhen he had finished his supper he went over to her.\r\n\r\n\"I didn't want ter strike yer, Lizay,\" he said. \"Do you feel haud agin me\r\nfer it?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" Lizay answered: \"he made yer do it. Yer couldn't he'p it. I reckon\r\nyer'll have ter whip me agin ter-morrer night. I mos' knows my baskit won't\r\nweigh no two hunderd an' fawty-seven poun's. 'Tain't fa'r ter 'spec' that\r\nmuch from me: it's a heap more'n tother gals gits, an' mos' all uv um is\r\nheap bigger'n me. I's small pertatoes.\" She laughed a little at her jest.\r\n\r\n\"Yer's some punkins,\" said Alston, returning the joke. \"I'd give a heap ef\r\nI could pick cotton like yer.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yer's improved a heap,\" said Little Lizay. \"Ef yer keeps on improvin',\r\nmayby yer'll git so yer kin he'p me arter 'while.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mayby so,\" Alston answered.\r\n\r\n\"But yer wouldn't he'p me, I reckon. Reckon yer'd he'p Edny Ann: yer likes\r\nher better'n me.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I don't.\"\r\n\r\n\"Reckon yer likes somebody in Virginny more'n yer likes anybody on this\r\nplantation.\"\r\n\r\n\"I's better 'quainted back thar',\" said Alston apologetically.\r\n\r\n\"But thar' ain't no use hankerin' arter them yer's lef 'hin' yer: reckon\r\nyer won't never see um no mo'. Heap better git sati'fied yere. It's a long\r\nway back thar', ain't it?\"\r\n\r\n\"A mighty long way,\" said Alston; and then he was silent, his thoughts\r\ngoing back and back over the long way.\r\n\r\nLizay recalled him: \"Was yer sorry yer had ter whip me?\"\r\n\r\n\"I was mighty sorry, Little Lizay,\" he replied with a strong tone of\r\ntenderness that made her heart beat faster. \"I would er knocked that white\r\nnigger down, but it wouldn't er he'ped nothin'. Things would er jus' been\r\nwusser.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" Lizay assented, \"nothin' won't he'p us: ain't no use in nothin'.\"\r\n\r\n\"Reckon I'll go in an' go ter sleep,\" said Alston: \"got ter git up early in\r\nthe mawnin'.\"\r\n\r\nHe _was_ up early the next morning, he and Little Lizay being again in the\r\ncotton-field before dawn. All through the day there was, as before,\r\npersistent devotion to the picking; then the holding on after dusk for one\r\nmore pound; the same result at night--the man up to the required figure,\r\nthe woman behind, this time forty-one pounds behind. Again she received a\r\ncowhiding at Alston's hands.\r\n\r\n\"What yer mean by this yere foolin'?\" Mr. Buck demanded in a rage of Little\r\nLizay. \"Yer reckon I's gwine ter stan' this yere? Two hunderd an'\r\nfawty-seven 'gin two hunderd an' six! It's all laziness an' mulishness.\r\nI'll git yer outen that thar' notch, else I'll kill yer. Look yere:\r\nter-morrer, ef yer don't come ter taw, I'll give yer twict es many licks es\r\nthe poun's yer falls behin'.\"\r\n\r\nDid this threat frighten Little Lizay out of her devotion?\r\n\r\n\"Two hunderd is 'nuff fer a little gal like yer,\" Alston said the next\r\nmorning. \"Save my life, I can't pick no more'n a hunderd an' a few poun's\r\nmo'. I wouldn't stan' ter be flogged ef I'd done my shar'.\"\r\n\r\n\"Got ter stan' it--can't he'p myse'f.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'd go ter town an' tell Mos' Hawton. I's tolerbul sho' he wouldn't 'low\r\nyer ter git twict es many licks, nohow. Mos' Hawton's tolerbul good ter his\r\nblack folks, ain't he?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, tolerbul--to the house-sarvants he's got in town; but he jist goes\r\n'long mindin' his business thar', an' don't pay no 'tention sca'cely ter\r\nhis plantation. He don't want us ter come 'plainin' ter him. He's mighty\r\nbusy--gits a heap er practice, makes a heap er money. He went down the\r\nriver onct, more'n a hunderd miles, ter cut somethin' off a man--I fawgits\r\nwhat 'twas--an' the man paid him hunderds an' hunderds an' hunderds--I\r\nfawgits how much 'twas.\"\r\n\r\nHere Little Lizay found that Alston was no longer listening, but was\r\nabsorbed with the cotton-picking.\r\n\r\nThat day, to save the pickers' time, their bacon and corn pones were\r\nbrought out to the field by wagon in wooden trays and buckets. There were\r\nthree cotton-baskets filled with corn dodgers. Alston and Little Lizay sat\r\nnot far apart while eating their dinners.\r\n\r\n\"I reckon I's gittin' 'long tolerbul well ter-day,\" he said. \"Dun know for\r\nsar-tin, but looks like the pickin' wus heap handier than at fus'. Look\r\nyere, Lizay: ef I know'd I'd git more'n a hunderd I'd he'p yer 'long: I'd\r\ngive yer the balance. Couldn't stave off all the floggin', but I might save\r\nyer some licks.\"\r\n\r\n\"Take kere yer ownse'f, Als'on. I don't min' the las' few licks: they don't\r\nnever hut bad es the fus' ones.\" This was Little Lizay's answer, given with\r\nglowing cheek and eyes looking down. To her own heart she said, \"I likes\r\nhim better'n he likes me. Reckon he can't git over mou'nin' fer somebody in\r\nVirginny.\" She wondered if he had left a wife back there: she would test\r\nhim. \"Reckon yer'll hear from yer wife any mo', Als'on?\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, reckon I will. She said she'd write me a letter. She didn't b'long\r\nter my ol' moster: she b'longed ter Squire Minor. I tuck a wife off'en our\r\nplantation. She's goin' ter ax her moster ter sell her an' the childun to\r\nMos' Hawton, and I's waitin' ter fin' out ef he'll sell 'um. I ain't goin'\r\nter cou't no other gal tell I fin's out.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yer hopes he'll sell her, don't yer?\" Little Lizay asked with an anxious\r\nheart.\r\n\r\n\"She wus a mighty good wife,\" said Alston, without committing himself by a\r\ncategorical answer. \"Would seem like Ol' Virginny ter have her an' the\r\nchildun, but they's better off thar'. They couldn't pick cotton, I reckon.\r\nHer moster an' mistiss thinks a heap uv her: she's one the cooks. I don't\r\nreckon they kin spaw her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't yer, sho' 'nuff?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I don't reckon they kin, 'cause one Mis' Minor's cooks is gittin' ol'\r\nan' can't see good--Aunt Juno. She wucks up flies an' sich into the cawn\r\nbread. They wants ter put my wife into her place, but they can't git shet\r\nwith Aunt Juno: she's jis' boun' she'll do the white folks' cookin'. She\r\nsays thar' ain't no use in bein' free ef she can't do what she pleases:\r\nthey set her free Chrismus 'fo' las'. But law, Lizay! we mus' hurry up an'\r\nget ter pickin'.\"\r\n\r\nThat night Lizay had gained on her basket of the preceding day by five and\r\na half pounds, and Alston had fallen behind his by four. But as he was\r\nstill over a hundred he escaped a flogging. Mr. Buck, being unable to\r\nreckon exactly the number of lashes to which Little Lizay was entitled,\r\ngave the rawhide the benefit of any doubt and ordered Alston to administer\r\nseventy-five lashes.\r\n\r\nThe next day nothing noticeable occurred in the lives of these two slaves,\r\nexcept that Alston's basket fell yet behind: Mr. Buck acknowledged it was a\r\n\"hunderd, but a mighty tight squeeze,\" while Little Lizay's had gained\r\nthree pounds on the last weight.\r\n\r\n\"Yer saved six lashes ter-day, Little Lizay,\" Alston said. He was evidently\r\nglad for her, and her hungry heart was glad that he cared.\r\n\r\n\"An' yer didn't haudly git clear,\" she replied, adding to herself that\r\nto-morrow she must be more generous with her help to Alston.\r\n\r\nBut on the morrow something occurred which dismayed the girl. She had\r\nshaken her sack over Alston's basket, designing to empty a third of its\r\ncontents there, and then the remainder in her \"pick.\" But the cotton was\r\nclosely packed in the sack, and almost the whole of it tumbled in a compact\r\nmass into Alston's basket. He would not need so much help as this to ensure\r\nhim, so she proceeded to transfer a portion of the heap to her basket.\r\nSuddenly she started as though shot. Some one was calling to her and making\r\na terrible accusation. The some one was Edny Ann: \"Yer's stealin' thar': I\r\nsee'd yer do it--see'd yer takin' cotton outen Als'on's baskit. Ain't yer\r\nshame, yer yaller good-fer-nuffin'? I's gwine ter tell.\" This was the\r\nterrible accusation.\r\n\r\n\"Yer dun know nothin' 'tall 'bout it,\" said Little Lizay. \"It's my cotton.\r\nI emptied it in Als'on's baskit when I didn't go ter do it. I ain't tuck a\r\nsol'tary lock er Als'on's cotton; an' I wouldn't, nuther, ter save my\r\nlife.\"\r\n\r\n\"Reckon yer kin fool me?\" demanded the triumphant Edny Ann. Then she called\r\nAlston with the _O_ which Southerners inevitably prefix: \"O Als'on! O\r\nAls'on! come yere! quick!\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't, please don't, tell him,\" Little Lizay pleaded. \"I'll give yer my\r\nnew cal'ker dress ef yer won't tell nobody.\"\r\n\r\nBut Edny Ann went on calling: \"O Als'on! O Als'on! come yere!\"\r\n\r\nLittle Lizay pleaded in a frantic way for silence as she saw Alston coming\r\nwith long strides up between the cotton-rows toward them.\r\n\r\n\"I wants yer ter ten' ter Lizay,\" said Edny Ann. \"Her's been stealin' yer\r\ncotton: see'd 'er do it--see'd 'er take a heap er cotton outen yer baskit\r\nan' ram it into hern. Did so!\"\r\n\r\nThen you should have seen the man's face. Had it been white you could not\r\nhave discerned any plainer the surprise, the disappointment, the grief.\r\nLizay saw with an indefinable thrill the sadness in his eyes, heard the\r\ngrief in his voice.\r\n\r\n\"I didn't reckon yer'd do sich a thing, Lizay,\" he said. \"I know it's\r\nmighty haud on yer, gittin' cowhided ev'ry night, but stealin' ain't goin'\r\nter he'p it, Lizay.\"\r\n\r\n\"I never stole yer cotton, Als'on,\" Little Lizay said with a certain\r\ndignity, but with an unsteady voice.\r\n\r\n\"I see'd yer do it,\" Edny Ann interrupted.\r\n\r\n\"I emptied my sack in yer baskit when I didn't go ter do it,\" Little Lizay\r\ncontinued. \"It wus my own cotton I wus takin' out yer baskit.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ef yer deny it, Lizay, yer'll make it wusser.\" Then Alston went up close\r\nto her, so that Edny Ann might not hear, and said something in a low tone.\r\n\r\nLizay gave him a swift look of surprise: then her lip began to quiver; the\r\nquick tears came to her eyes; she put both hands to her face and cried\r\nhard, so that she could not have found voice if she had wished to tell\r\nAlston her story. He went back to his row, and left her there crying beside\r\nthe pick-baskets. He returned almost immediately, shouldered his basket,\r\nand went away from her to another part of the field, leaving his row\r\nunfinished. He wondered how much cotton Lizay had taken from his basket--if\r\nits weight would be brought down below a hundred; and meditated what he\r\nshould do in case he was called up to be flogged by the brutal overseer.\r\nShould he stand and take the lashing, trusting to Heaven to make it up to\r\nhim some day? or should he knock the overseer senseless and make a strike\r\nfor freedom? Where was freedom? Which was the way to the free North? In\r\nVirginia he would have known in what direction to set his face for Ohio,\r\nbut here everything was new and strange.\r\n\r\nHowever, he had no occasion for a desperate movement that night. His basket\r\nweighed one hundred and seven, while Little Lizay's had fallen lower than\r\never before. Alston thought it was because she had missed her chance of\r\ntransferring the usual quantity of cotton from his basket.\r\n\r\nThe striking of Lizay had never seemed so abhorrent to him as on this\r\nnight, now that there was estrangement between them. She was already\r\nhumiliated in his sight, and to raise his hand against her was like\r\nstriking a fallen foe. She would think that he was no longer sorry--that he\r\nwas glad to repay the wrong she had done him.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, Edny Ann had told the story of the theft to one and\r\nanother, and Lizay found at night the \"quarter\" humming with it. Taunts and\r\njeers met her on every hand. Stealing from white folks the negroes regarded\r\nas a very trifling matter, since they, the slaves, had earned everything\r\nthere was: but to steal from \"a po' nigger\" was the meanest thing in their\r\ndecalogue.\r\n\r\n\"Stealin' from her beau!\" sneered one negro, commenting on Little Lizay's\r\noffence.\r\n\r\n\"An' her sweet'art!\" said another.\r\n\r\n\"An' her 'tendin' like her lubbed 'im!\"\r\n\r\n\"An' Als'on can't pick cotton fas', nohow, kase he ain't use ter\r\ncotton--neber see'd none till he come yere--an' her know'd he'd git a\r\ncowhidin'. It's meaner'n boneset tea,\" said Edny Ann.\r\n\r\n\"A heap meaner,\" assented Cat. \"Sich puffawmance's wusser'n stealin' acawns\r\nfrum a blin' hog.\"\r\n\r\nOver and over Little Lizay said, \"I never stole Als'on's cotton;\" and then\r\nshe would make her explanation, as she had made it to Edny Ann and Alston.\r\nOften she was tempted to tell the whole story of how she had been all along\r\nhelping Alston at her own cost, but many motives restrained her. She\r\ndreaded the jeers and jests to which the story would subject her, and\r\neverything was to be feared from Mr. Buck's retaliation should he learn\r\nthat he had been tricked. Besides, she wished, if possible, to go on\r\nhelping Alston. She doubted, too, if he would receive it well that she had\r\nbeen helping him. Might he not gravely resent it that through her action\r\nsuch a pitiable part in the drama had been forced on him? Then there was\r\nsomething sweet to Little Lizay in suffering all alone for Alston--in\r\nhaving this secret unshared: she respected herself more that she did not\r\nrisk everything to vindicate herself, for this she could do: the steelyard\r\nto-morrow would demonstrate the truth of her story.\r\n\r\nBut the morrow came, and she went out to the field, her story untold, a\r\nmarked woman. Yet she was not comfortless. The something that Alston had\r\ntold her the previous day was making her heart sing. This is what he told\r\nher: \"While yer wus stealin' from me, Lizay, I wus he'pin' yer. I put a\r\nha'f er sack in yer baskit ter-day, an' a ha'f er sack yistiddy--kase I\r\nliked yer, Lizay.\"\r\n\r\nShe took her rows beside Alston's as usual, determined to watch for a\r\nchance to help him. But when he moved away from her and took another row,\r\nLizay knew that the time had come. She couldn't stand it to have him strain\r\nand tug and bend to his work as no other hand in the field did, only to be\r\ndisappointed at night. She could never bear it that he should be flogged\r\nafter all she had done to save him from the shame. She could never live\r\nthrough it--the cowhiding of her hero by the detested overseer. Yes, the\r\ntime had come: she must tell Alston.\r\n\r\nShe went over to where he had begun a new row. \"Yer don't b'lieve the tale\r\nI tole yistiddy, Als'on: yer's feared I'll steal yer cotton ter-day,\" she\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n\"I don't wish no talk 'bout it, Lizay,\" Alston said. His tone was half sad,\r\nhalf peremptory.\r\n\r\n\"Yer mustn't feel haud agin me ef I tells you somethin', Als'on. Yer's been\r\nputtin' cotton in my baskit unbeknownst ter save me some lashes, an' yer\r\nthrow'd it up ter me yistiddy. Now, look yere, Als'on: I's been he'pin' yer\r\nall this week, ever since Mr. Buck said yer got ter git a hunderd. Ev'ry\r\nday I's he'ped yer git up ter a hunderd.\"\r\n\r\nAlston had stopped picking, both his hands full of cotton, and stood\r\nstaring in a bewildered way at the girl. \"Lizay, is this a fac'?\" he said\r\nat length.\r\n\r\n\"'Tis so, Als'on; an' ef yer don't lemme he'p yer now yer'll fall 'hin' an'\r\nhave ter git flogged.\"\r\n\r\n\"An' ef yer he'p me, yer'll fall shawt an' have ter git flogged. Oh, Lizay,\r\nthar' never was nobody afo' would er done this yer fer me,\" Alston said,\r\nfeeling that he would like to kiss the poor shoulders that had been\r\nscourged for him. Great tears gathered in his eyes, and he thought without\r\nspeaking the thought, \"My wife in Virginny wouldn't er done it.\"\r\n\r\n\"So yer mus' lemme he'p yer ter-day,\" said Little Lizay.\r\n\r\n\"I'll die fus',\" he said in a savage tone.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yer'll git a whippin', Als'on, sho's yer bawn.\"\r\n\r\n\"No: I won't take a floggin' from that brute.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Als'on, yer jis' got ter: yer can't he'p the miserbulness. No use\r\nrunnin' 'way: they'd ketch yer an' bring yer back. Thar's nigger-hunters\r\nan' blood-houn's all roun' this yer naberhood. Yer couldn't git 'way ter\r\nsave yer life.\"\r\n\r\n\"Look yere, Lizay,\" Alston said with sudden inspiration: \"le's go tell\r\nMos' Hawton all 'bout it. Ef he's a genulman he'll 'ten' ter us. They won't\r\nmiss us till night, an' 'fo' that time we'll be in Memphis. Yer knows the\r\nway, don't yer?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" Lizay said; \"an' I reckon that's the bes' thing we kin do--go tell\r\nmoster an' mistis. But, law! I ought er go pull off this yere ole homespun\r\ndress an' put on my new cal'ker.\"\r\n\r\n\"I reckon we ain't got no time ter dress up,\" said Alston. \"We mus' start\r\nquick: come 'long. Le's hide our baskits fus' whar' the cotton-stalks is\r\nthick.\"\r\n\r\nThis they did, and then started off at a brisk pace, their flight concealed\r\nby the tall cotton-plants. They reached Memphis about eleven o'clock, and\r\nfound Dr. Horton at home, having just finished his lunch. They were\r\nadmitted at once to the dining-room, where the doctor sat picking his\r\nteeth. He had never seen Alston, as the new negroes had been bought by an\r\nagent.\r\n\r\n\"Sarvant, moster!\" Alston said humbly, but with dignity.\r\n\r\n\"Howdy, moster?\" was Little Lizay's more familiar salutation.\r\n\r\n\"I's Als'on, one yer new boys from Ol' Virginny.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're a likely-lookin' fellow,\" said the doctor, who was given to\r\ndropping final consonants in his speech. \"I reckon I'll hear a good report\r\nof you from Mr. Buck. You look like you could stan' up to work like a\r\nsoldier. But what's brought you and Little Lizay to the city? Anything gone\r\nwrong?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, moster,\" said Alston--\"mighty wrong. Look yere, Mos' Hawton: when I\r\ncome on yer plantation I made up my min' ter sarve yer faithful--ter wuck\r\nfer yer haud's I could--ter strike ev'ry lick I could fer yer. When I hoed\r\ncawn an' pulled fodder I went 'head er all the han's on yer plantation. But\r\nwhen I went ter pick cotton I wusn't use ter it. I wuckt haud's I could,\r\n'fo' day an' arter dark. Mos' Hawton, I couldn't pick a poun' more'n I pick\r\nter save my life. But I wus 'hin' all t'other han's. Then Mos' Buck wus\r\ngoin' ter flog me ef I didn't git a hunderd: then Little Lizay, her he'ped\r\nme unbeknownst: ev'ry day she puts cotton in my baskit ter fetch it ter a\r\nhunderd, an' that made her fall 'hin' las' year's pickin'; then ev'ry night\r\nshe was stripped an' cowhided; but she kep' on he'pin' me, an' kep' on\r\ngettin' whipped. I dun know what she dun it fer: 'min's me uv the Laud on\r\nthe cross.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Horton knew what she did it for. His knightliness was touched to the\r\nquick. The story made him wish as never before to be a better master than\r\nhe had ever been to his poor people. He asked many questions, and drew\r\nforth all the facts, Lizay telling how Alston was helping her while she was\r\nhelping him. Dr. Horton saw that here was a romance in slave-life--that the\r\nman and woman were in love with each other.\r\n\r\n\"Well, if you can't pick cotton,\" he said to Alston, \"what can you do?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mos' anything else, moster. I kin do ev'rything 'bout cawn; I kin split\r\nrails; I kin plough; I kin drive carriage.\"\r\n\r\n\"Could you run a cotton-gin?\"\r\n\r\n\"Reckon so, moster: the black folks says it's tolerbul easy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, now, look here: you and Lizay get some dinner, an' then do you take\r\na back-trot for the plantation. I'll sen' Buck a note: no, he can't more'n\r\nhalf read writin'. Well, do you tell him, Alston, to put you to ginnin'\r\ncotton: Little Sam mus' work with you a few days till you get the hang of\r\nthe thing; an' then I want you to show that plantation what 'tis to serve\r\nmaster faithfully. You see, I believe in you, my man.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thanky, moster. I'll wuck fer yer haud's I kin. Please God, I'll sarve yer\r\nfaithful.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of cou'se, Lizay, you'll go back to pickin' cotton, an' don't let me hear\r\nany mo' of you' nonsense--helpin' a strappin' fellow twice you' size. An'\r\ntell Buck I won't have him whippin' any my negroes ev'ry night in the week.\r\nConfound it! a mule couldn't stan' it. If I've got a negro that needs\r\nfloggin' ev'ry night, I'll sell him or give 'im away, or turn 'im out to\r\ngrass to shif' for himself. I'll be out there soon, an' 'ten' to things. If\r\nanybody needs a floggin', tell Buck to send 'im to me. Tell the folks to\r\nwork like clever Christians, an' they shall have a fus'-rate Christmas--a\r\nheap of Christmas-gifts.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, moster.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you an' Lizay want to get married right away, or wait till Christmas?\"\r\n\r\nAlston and Little Lizay looked at each other, smiling in an embarrassed\r\nway.\r\n\r\n\"But, moster,\" said Alston, \"I's got a wife an' fou' childun in Ol'\r\nVirginny, an' I promused I'd wait an' wouldn't git morred ag'in tell she'd\r\nwrite ter me ef her moster'd sell her; an' I was goin' ter ax yer ter buy\r\n'er.\"\r\n\r\n\"You needn't pester yourself about that. I got a letter for you the other\r\nday from her,\" the doctor said, fumbling in his pockets.\r\n\r\n\"Yer did, sah?\" Alston said with interest.\r\n\r\n\"Yes: here it is. Can you read? or shall I read it to you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ef yer please, moster.\"\r\n\r\nThen Dr. Horton read:\r\n\r\n\"MY DEAR B'LOVED HUSBUN': Miss Marthy Jane takes my pen in han' ter let yer\r\nknow I's well, an' our childun's well, an' all the black folks is tolerbul\r\nwell 'cept Juno: her's got the polsy tolerbul bad. All the white folks\r\n'bout yere is will 'cept mistis: her's got the dumps. All the childun say,\r\nHowdy? the black folks all says, Howdy? an' Pete says, Howdy? an' Andy\r\nsays, Howdy? an' Viny says, Howdy? an' Cinthy says, Howdy? an' Tony Tucker\r\nsays, Howdy? and Brudder Thomas Jeff'son Hollan' says, Howdy? Last time I\r\nsee'd Benj'man Franklins Bedfud, he says, ''Member, an' don't fawgit, the\r\nfus' time yer writes, ter tell Als'on, Howdy?'\r\n\r\n\"Yer 'fectionate wife, CHLOE.\"\r\n\r\n\"P.S. Mistis says her can't spaw me, so 'tain't no use waitin' no longer\r\nfer me. 'Sides, I got 'gaged ter git morred: I wus morred Sundy 'fo' las'\r\nat quat'ly meetin'. Brudder Mad'son Mason puffawmed the solemn cer'mony,\r\nan' preached a beautiful discou'se. Me an' my secon' husbun' gits 'long\r\nfus'-rate. I fawgot ter tell yer who I got morred to. I got morred to\r\nThomas Jeff'son Hollan'.\"\r\n\r\n\"So you're a free man,\" said Dr. Horton, folding the letter and handing it\r\nto Alston. \"You an' Little Lizay can get married to-day, right now, if you\r\nwish to. Uncle Moses can marry you: he's a member of the Church in good an'\r\nregular standin': I don't know but he's an exhorter, or class-leader, or\r\nsomethin'. What do you say? Shall I call him in an' have him tie you\r\ntogether?\"\r\n\r\n\"Thanky, moster, ef Little Lizay's willin'.--Is yer, Lizay?\"\r\n\r\n\"I reckon so,\" said Lizay, her heart beating in gladness. But she\r\nnevertheless glanced down at her coarse field-dress and thought with\r\nlonging of the new calico in her cabin.\r\n\r\nSo Uncle Moses was called in, and Mrs. Horton and all the children and\r\nservants.\r\n\r\n\"Uncle Moses,\" said Dr. Horton, \"did you ever marry anybody?\"\r\n\r\n\"To be sho', Mos' Hawton. I's morred--Lemme see how many wives has I morred\r\nsence I fus' commenced?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I don't mean that;\" and Dr. Horton proceeded to explain what he did\r\nmean.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Moses. \"I never done any that business, but reckon I could: I's\r\ndone things a heap hauder.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, let me see you try your han' on this couple.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Uncle Moses, \"git me a book: got ter have a Bible, or\r\nhymn-book, or cat'chism, or somethin'.\"\r\n\r\nThe doctor gravely handed over a pocket edition of _Don Quixote_, which\r\nhappened to lie in his reach.\r\n\r\nUncle Moses took it for a copy of the _Methodist Discipline_, and made\r\npretence of seeking for the marriage ceremony. At length he appeared\r\nsatisfied that he had the right page, and stood up facing the couple.\r\n\r\n\"Jine boff yer right han's,\" he solemnly commanded. Then, with his eyes on\r\nthe book, he repeated the marriage service, with some remarkable\r\nemendations. \"An' ef yer solemnly promus,\" he said in conclusion, \"ter lub\r\nan' 'bey one 'nuther tell death pawts yer, please de Laud yer lib so long,\r\nI pernounces boff yer all man an' wife.\"\r\n\r\nThen the mistress looked about and got together a basket of household\r\narticles for the new couple. Bearing this between them, Alston and Little\r\nLizay went back to the plantation and to their unfinished rows of cotton,\r\nhappy, poor souls! pathetic as it seems.\r\n\r\nSARAH WINTER KELLOGG.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BASS OF THE POTOMAC.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome twenty-five years ago Mr. William Shriver, a primitive pisciculturist,\r\ntook from the Youghiogheny River eleven black bass, and conveyed them in\r\nthe tank of the tender of a locomotive to Cumberland, in the coal-region of\r\nWestern Maryland. There he deposited them in the Potomac, with the\r\ninjunction which forms the heraldic motto of the State of\r\nMaryland--_Crescite et multiplicamini_. The first part of this excellent\r\nprecept they obeyed by proceeding to devour all the aboriginal fish in the\r\nriver, and waxing extremely hearty upon the liberal diet. The second they\r\nperformed with a diligence so commendable that the name of them in the\r\nriver became as legion, and the original possessors of the waters were\r\nsteadily extirpated or took despairingly to small rivulets, and led ever\r\nafter a life of undeserved ignominy and obscurity. There were bass in the\r\nriver from the Falls of the Potomac, near Georgetown, to a point as near\r\nits source as any self-respecting fish could approach without detriment to\r\nthe buttons on his vest by reason of the shallowness of the water. They\r\nwere in all its tributaries, and in fact monopolized its waters completely.\r\nHad the supply of small fish for food held out, it is impossible to say to\r\nwhat extent they would have increased. They might in their numerical\r\nenormity have rivalled the condition of that famous river, the Wabash,\r\nwhich in a certain season of excessive dryness became so low that a local\r\njournal of established veracity described the fish as having to stand upon\r\ntheir heads to breathe, and while in that constrained attitude being pulled\r\nby the inhabitants like radishes in a garden.\r\n\r\nIt has been contended by some ichthyologists that the black bass does not\r\neat its own kind, but the spectacle which I recently beheld of a\r\nfour-pounder, defunct and floating on the water, with the tail and half the\r\nbody of a ten-ounce bass sticking out of his distended mouth, affords but\r\ninadequate confirmation of their views. I sat upon the bass in question,\r\nand rendered a verdict of \"choked to death, and served him right.\" He had\r\nswallowed the younger fish, who, for aught he knew to the contrary, or\r\ncared, might have been his own son; and his confidence in his capacity\r\nbeing ably supported by his appetite, he undertook a contract to which he\r\nwas unequal in the matter of expansion. He couldn't disgorge, being in the\r\npredicament of the boa-constrictor who swallows a hen head first, and finds\r\nher go against the grain when he would fain reconsider the subject. The\r\nhead of the inside fish was partially digested, but that process had\r\nimparted no gratification to either party, and both were defunct, mutually\r\nimmolated upon the altar of gluttony. It is not an uncommon thing to find\r\nthem dead in that condition, for their appetites are ravenous, and lead\r\nthem into indiscretions more or less serious in their consequences.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt of their having regarded as a delicate attention the\r\naction some few years since of the Maryland Fish Commissioner in placing\r\nseveral thousand young California salmon in the river. Those salmon have\r\nnever been seen or heard of since; but, although the bass for some time had\r\na guilty look about them, it is hardly fair to let them remain under so\r\ngrievous an imputation as is implied in the whole responsibility for the\r\nfate of the California emigrants. The fact is, that at Georgetown the\r\nPotomac River makes a very abrupt change in its grade, and the Great Falls,\r\nas they are called, are both picturesque and arduous of passage. The\r\nsalmon, being of luxurious habit, betakes him each year to the seaside, and\r\nat the end of the season returns in a connubial frame of mind to the spot\r\nendeared to him by his early associations. It is quite possible that these\r\nparticular salmon when on their way to the purlieus of marine fashion were\r\nsomewhat discouraged at the jar and shock incident to their transit over\r\nthe Falls. They may have concluded that the locality was unpropitious for\r\nthe return trip, and then, consulting with salmon whose lines had been cast\r\nin more pleasant places, they may have ascended rivers of more conspicuous\r\nnatural attractions and more agreeable to fish of cultivated habits.\r\n\r\nThe habits of the black bass may be described as generally bad. It is a\r\nfish devoid of any of the cardinal virtues. It is ever engaged in\r\ninternecine war, and will any day forego a square meal for the sake of a\r\nfight. It gorges itself like a python, and when hooked is as game as a\r\nsalmon, and quite as vigorous in proportion to size. In the Potomac it has\r\nbeen known to weigh as much as six pounds, but bass of that weight are very\r\nrare, from three to four pounds being the average of what are known as good\r\nfish. These afford excellent sport, and are taken with a variety of bait.\r\nThe habitués of the river commonly employ live minnow, chub, catfish,\r\nsuckers, sunfish--in fact, any fish under six inches in length. The bass\r\nhas also a well-marked predilection for small frogs, or indeed for frogs of\r\nany dimensions. It sometimes rises well at a gaudy, substantial fly or a\r\ndeft simulation of a healthy Kansas grasshopper; but fishermen have noticed\r\nthat the largest fish despise flies, much as a person of a full roast-beef\r\nhabit may be supposed to turn up his nose at a small mutton-chop. In other\r\nrivers they take the fly quite freely, but in the Potomac they have had\r\nthat branch of their education greatly neglected. In the matter of\r\nvitality they are simply extraordinary: they cling to life with a tenacity\r\nthat very few fish exhibit. In the spring or fall, when the water and the\r\nair are at a comparatively low temperature, a bass will live for eight or\r\nten hours without water. The writer has brought fifty fish, weighing on an\r\naverage two and three-quarter pounds, from Point of Rocks to Baltimore, a\r\ndistance of seventy-two miles, and after they had been in the air six hours\r\nhas placed them in a tub of water and found two-thirds of the number\r\nimmediately \"kick\" and plunge with an amount of energy and ability that\r\nthrew the water in all directions. These fish had been caught at various\r\ntimes during the day, and as each was taken from the hook a stout leather\r\nstrap was forced through the floor of its mouth beneath its tongue, and the\r\nbunch of fish so secured allowed to trail overboard in the stream. They\r\nwere thus dragged all day against a powerful current, but never showed any\r\nsymptoms of \"drowning.\" In the evening they were strung upon a stout piece\r\nof clothes-line, and after lying for some time on the railway platform were\r\ntransferred to the floor of the baggage-car, and so transported to the\r\ncity. It is quite evident that we do not live in the fear of Mr. Bergh. But\r\nwhat is one to do? The fish is not to be discouraged except by the\r\nexhibition of great and brutal violence. In fact, bass will not be induced\r\nto decently decease by any civilized process short of a powerful shock from\r\na voltaic pile administered in the region of their _medulla oblongata_. Of\r\ncourse, one cannot be expected to carry about a voltaic pile and go hunting\r\nfor the medullary recesses of a savage and turbulent fish. On the other\r\nhand, one may batter the protoplasm out of a refractory subject by the aid\r\nof a small rock, but it won't improve the fish's looks or cooking\r\nqualities. It may seem like high treason to mention, moreover, at a safe\r\ndistance from Mr. Bergh, that euthanasia in animals designed for the table\r\ndoes not always improve their quality, and in fact that the linked misery\r\nlong drawn out of a protracted dissolution imparts a certain tenderness and\r\nflavor to the flesh that it would not otherwise possess. Should that\r\nexcellent and most estimable gentleman regard this statement with a\r\nsceptical eye, let it be here stated that the bass should be recently\r\nkilled, split, crimped and broiled to a delicate brown, with a little good\r\nbutter and a sprinkling of pepper, salt and chopped parsley. Should he\r\npursue the subject upon this basis, he will not be the first gentleman who\r\nhas surrendered his convictions and compounded a culinary felony upon\r\nfavorable terms.\r\n\r\nBelow Harper's Ferry there is one of the most picturesque reaches of the\r\nPotomac River. From the rugged heights that frown upon that historic and\r\nlovely spot, where the Shenandoah strikes away through the pass that leads\r\nto the broad and beautiful Valley of Virginia, and where John Brown's\r\nmemory struggles through battered ruins and the invading smoke of the\r\nunhallowed locomotive, the river chafes from side to side of the stern\r\ndefile that hems it in and curbs its restless waters. Great walls of dark\r\nrocks, crested by serried ranks of solemn pines, stand guard above its\r\nfitful, surging flood, and against the dark blue calm and misty depth of\r\nits gorge the pale smoke rises in a quiet column above the mills and houses\r\nthat nestle by the river's bed. Huge boulders stem the current, and the\r\nrocks stand out in shelves and rugged ridges, around which the stream\r\nwhirls swiftly and sweeps off into broad dark pools in whose green,\r\nmysterious depths there should be noble fish. Below, the river widens and\r\nhas long placid reaches, but for the most part its banks are precipitous,\r\nand the deep water runs along the trunks and bares the roots of great trees\r\nwhose branches stretch far out over its surface. Occasionally, the\r\nmountains recede and form a vast amphitheatre, clad in primeval forest, and\r\nthere are islands on which vegetation runs riot in its unbridled luxury,\r\nand weaves festoons of gay creepers to conceal the gaunt skeletons of the\r\nendless piles of dead drift-wood. All is in the most glorious green--a very\r\nextravagance of fresh and brilliant color--relieved with the bright\r\npurples and tender leafing of the flowering shrubs and vines that\r\nintertwine among its heavy jungle. Upon the broad, flat rocks one may see\r\ndozens of stolid \"sliders,\" or mud-turtles, some of great size, basking in\r\nthe sun like so many boarders at a country hotel. They crowd upon the rocks\r\nas thickly as they can, and blink there all day long unless disturbed by\r\nthe approach of a boat, when they dive clumsily but quickly. Occasionally,\r\none sees an otter, with seal-like head above the surface of the water,\r\nswimming swiftly from haunt to haunt in pursuit of the bass; and small\r\ncoteries of summer ducks fly swiftly from sedge to sedge.\r\n\r\nThe acoustic properties of the river would make an architect die with envy.\r\nThe light breeze bears one's conversation audibly for half a mile; one\r\nhears the splash of a fish that jumps a thousand yards away; and the grim\r\ncliffs at the foot of which the canal winds in and out take up the\r\nprofanity of the towpath and hurl it back and forth across the river as if\r\nit was great fun and all propriety. The stalwart exhortations and clean-cut\r\nphraseology of the mule-drivers and the notes of the bugles go ringing over\r\nto Virginia's shore, and fill the air with cadences so sweet and musical\r\nthat they sound like the pleasant laughter of good-humored Nature, instead\r\nof the well-punctuated and diligent ribaldry of the most profane class of\r\nhumanity in existence. It is perfectly startling and frightful to hear an\r\nobjurgation of the most utterly purposeless and ingeniously vile\r\ndescription transmitted half a mile with painful distinctness, and then\r\nseized by a virtuous and reproachful echo and indignantly repelled in\r\ndisjointed fragments.\r\n\r\n\"Y'ill take care, sorr, an' sit fair in the middle of the shkiff,\" said Mr.\r\nMcGrath as I got into his frail craft at five o'clock in the morning on the\r\nbank of the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal near Point of Rocks. \"It's\r\nonconvanient to be outside of the boat whin we're going through them locks.\r\nThere were a gintleman done that last year, an' he come near lavin' a lot\r\nof orphans behind him.\"\r\n\r\n\"How was that, McGrath?\" said I.\r\n\r\n\"Begorra! the divil a child had he,\" he replied.\r\n\r\n\"But do you mean that he was drowned?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"Faith, an' he was that, sorr--complately.\"\r\n\r\nI promised Mr. McGrath that I would observe his instructions carefully, and\r\nthat gentleman, after placing the rods, live-bait bucket, luncheon-basket\r\nand other articles on board, took his seat in the bow, and we proceeded. We\r\nhad two boats for my companion and myself, and an experienced man in each.\r\nMr. McGrath had fallen to my lot, and my companion had a darkey named Pete.\r\nWe were to go up the canal some four miles, and then, launching the boats\r\ninto the river, were to fish slowly down with the current. We had a horse\r\nand tow-rope, and a small boy, mounted on the animal, started off at a\r\nsmart trot. It was quite exhilarating, and the boats dashed along merrily\r\nat a capital rate. A gray mist hung low on the river, and thin wraiths of\r\nit rose off the water of the canal and crept up the mountain-side,\r\nshrouding the black pines and hiding the summit from view. Beyond, the tops\r\nof the hills on the Virginia shore were beginning to blush as they caught\r\nthe first rays of sunrise, and the fish-hawk's puny scream echoed from the\r\nislands in the stream. It was a lovely morning, and promised a day, as Mr.\r\nMcGrath observed, on which some elegant fish should die. After a few delays\r\nat locks, in which canal-boats took precedence of us, we reached our point\r\nof transshipment, hauled the boats out on the bank, and our horse drew them\r\nsleigh-fashion across field and down to and out into the water.\r\n\r\nI had a light split bamboo rod, a good silk line and a fair assortment of\r\nflies. Mr. McGrath had a common bamboo cane, a battered old reel, and the\r\nvalue of his outfit might be generously estimated at half a dollar. In his\r\nlive-bait bucket were about a hundred fish, varying in length from two to\r\nsix inches. He did not prepare to fish himself, but was watching me with\r\nthe deepest attention. He held the boat across the stream toward the\r\nopposite shore, and by the time we dropped down on a large flat rock I was\r\nready. I got out, and there being a pleasant air stirring, I made my casts\r\nwith a great deal of ease and comfort. There was a deep hole below the\r\nrocks, bordered on both sides by a swift ripple--as pretty a spot as ever a\r\nfly was thrown over. I sped them over it in all directions, casting fifty\r\nand sixty feet of line, and admiring the soft flutter with which they\r\ndropped on the edge of the ripple or the open water. Mr. McGrath was\r\nsurveying the operation critically, nodding his head in approval from side\r\nto side, and uttering short ejaculations of the most flattering nature. I\r\nkept whipping the stream assiduously, so satisfied with my work and the\r\nstyle of it as to feel confident that no well-regulated fish could resist\r\nit. But there was no appearance of a rise: not a sign appeared on the water\r\nto show even the approach of a speculative fish. I was about to note the\r\nfact to Mr. McGrath when that gentleman remarked, \"Begorra! but it's\r\nilligant sport it'd be if the bass 'ud only bite at them things!\"\r\n\r\n\"Bite at them?\" said I, turning round: \"of course they'll bite at them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sorra bit will they, sorr. It's just wondherin' they are if them things up\r\nabove is good to ate, but they're too lazy to step up an' inquire. Augh, be\r\nme sowl! but it's the thruth I tell you. Now, if it was a dacent throut\r\nthat were there, he'd be afther acceptin' yer invite in a minit; but them\r\nbass--begorra! they're not amaynable to the fly at all.\"\r\n\r\nNow, if there is anything that I have been brought up to despise, it is\r\nfishing with \"bait.\" Fly-fishing I have learned to regard as the only\r\nlegitimate method of taking any fish that any sportsman ought to fish for,\r\nand fishing with a worm and a cork I always looked upon as equal to\r\nshooting a partridge on the ground in May. I did not believe Mr. McGrath,\r\nand I told him, as I resumed my graceful occupation, that I didn't think\r\nthere were any fish there to catch. The idea of their rejecting flies\r\nserved up as mine were was too preposterous.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said he, \"ye may be right, sorr: there may be none there at all;\r\nbut I'll thry them wid a bait, anyhow.\"\r\n\r\nIn another minute Mr. McGrath was slashing about right and left a bait\r\nwhich to my disordered vision looked as big as a Yarmouth bloater. He threw\r\nit in every direction with great vigor and precision, and, as I could not\r\nhelp noticing, with very little splashing. I turned away with emotion, and\r\ncontinued my fly-fishing. Presently I heard an exclamation from Mr.\r\nMcGrath, quickly succeeded by an ominous whirring of his reel.\r\n\r\n\"Luk at the vagabone, sorr! luk at him now! Run, ye divil ye! run!\" he\r\ncried as he facilitated the departure of the line, which was going out at a\r\nfamous rate. \"Bedad! he's a fine mikroptheros! Whisht! he's stopped.--Take\r\nthat, ye spalpeen ye!\"\r\n\r\nAs he said this he gave his rod a strong jerk, that brought the line up\r\nwith a \"zip\" out of the water in a long ridge, and the old bamboo cane bent\r\nuntil it cracked. At the same moment, about a hundred and fifty feet away,\r\na splendid fish leaped high and clear out of the water with the line\r\ndangling from his mouth. Mr. McGrath had struck him fairly, and away he\r\nwent across stream as hard as he could tear.\r\n\r\n\"Take the rod, sorr, while I get the landing-net. Kape a tight line on him,\r\nsorr: niver let him deludher ye. It's an illigant mikroptheros he is,\r\nsure!\"\r\n\r\nHe returned from the boat in a moment with the landing-net, but absolutely\r\nrefused to take back his rod: \"Sorra bit, sorr: bring him in. It's great\r\nfun ye'll have wid the vagabone in that current! No, sorr: bring him in\r\nyerself, sorr: ye'll niver lay it at my door that the first fish hooked\r\nwasn't brought in.\"\r\n\r\nI didn't need any instructions, and as the fish ran for a rock some\r\ndistance off, I brought him up sharply, and he jumped again as wickedly as\r\nhe could full three feet out of the water, and came straight toward us with\r\na rush. It was no use trying, I couldn't reel up quick enough, and he was\r\nunder the eddy at our feet before I had one-third of the line in.\r\nFortunately, he was securely hooked, and there was no drop out from the\r\nslacking of the line. He was in about twelve feet of water, and as I\r\nbrought the line taut on him again he went off down stream as fast as ever.\r\nI had the current full against him this time, and I brought him steadily up\r\nthrough it, and held him well in hand. I swept him around in front of Mr.\r\nMcGrath's landing-net, but he shied off so quickly that I thought he would\r\nbreak the line. Away down he went as stiffly and stubbornly as possible,\r\nand there he lodged, rubbing his nose against a rock and trying to get rid\r\nof the hook. Half a dozen times I dislodged him and brought him up, but he\r\nwas so wild and strong I did not dare to force him in. At last he made a\r\ndash for the ripple, and I gave him a quick turn, and as he struck out of\r\nit Mr. McGrath had his landing-net under him in a twinkling, and he was out\r\nkicking on the rock. He weighed four pounds six ounces, and furnished\r\nconclusive evidence that a bass of that weight can give a great deal of\r\nvery agreeable trouble before he will consent to leave his element.\r\n\r\n\"What was it,\" said I, \"that you called him when you struck him just now?\"\r\n\r\n\"What did I call him, sorr? A mikroptheros, sorr.\"\r\n\r\n\"And for Goodness' sake, McGrath, what is a mikroptheros?\"\r\n\r\n\"Begorra! that's what it is,\" said Mr. McGrath, throwing the bass overboard\r\nto swim at the end of its leathern thong.\r\n\r\n\"Well!\" said I in amazement. \"I never heard such a name as that for a fish\r\nin all my life!--a mikroptheros!\"\r\n\r\n\"Divil a more or less!\" said Mr. McGrath decidedly. \"The Fish Commissioner\r\nwor up here last week, an' sez he to me, sez he, 'It's a mikroptheros, so\r\nit is.'--'What's that?' sez I.--'That!' sez he; and he slaps him into an\r\nilligant glass bottle of sperrits, as I thought he was goin' to say to me,\r\n'McGrath, have ye a mouth on ye?' an' I as dhry as if I'd et red herrin's\r\nfor a week. 'Yis,' sez he to me, 'that's the right name of him;' and wid\r\nthat he writes it on a tag, and he sends it off, this side up wid care, to\r\nthe musayum. Sure I copied it: be me sowl, an' if ye doubt me word, here\r\nit is.\"\r\n\r\nMr. McGrath handed me a piece of paper torn off the margin of a newspaper,\r\non which he had written legibly enough, \"_Micropteros Floridanus_\" I read\r\nit as gravely as I could, smiled feebly at my own ignorance, and returned\r\nit to him, saying, \"Upon my word, McGrath, you are perfectly right. What a\r\nblessing it is to have had a classical education!\"\r\n\r\n\"Sorra lie in it,\" said he proudly as he replaced the slip in the crown of\r\nhis hat; \"an' it's meself that's glad of it.\"\r\n\r\nI can but throw myself upon the mercy of every respectable disciple of the\r\nart before whom this confession may come when I say that during this\r\nconversation I was employed in taking off my flies and in substituting\r\ntherefor a strong bass-hook and a cork, after the effective fashion of Mr.\r\nMcGrath. When this never-to-be-sufficiently-despised device was ready I\r\ntook from the bucket a small and unhappy sunfish, immolated him upon my\r\nhook by passing it through his upper and lower lips, and cast him out upon\r\nthe stream. The red top of the cork spun merrily down the current and out\r\namong the oily ripples of the deep water below, but Mr. McGrath could beat\r\nme completely in handling his. I noticed that I threw my fish so that it\r\nstruck hard upon the water, \"knocking the sowl out of it,\" as he said,\r\nwhile he threw his hither and thither with the greatest ease, always taking\r\ncare to do it with the least possible amount of violence, and keeping it\r\nalive as long as possible. However, it was not long before my cork\r\ndisappeared with a peculiar style of departure abundantly indicative of the\r\ncause, to which I replied by a vigorous \"strike.\" My cork came up promptly,\r\nand with it my hook, bare. The sunfish had found a grave within the natural\r\nenemy of his species, and I had missed my fish.\r\n\r\n\"Divvle a wondher!\" said Mr. McGrath in reply to a remark to that\r\neffect--\"being, sorr, that ye're not familiar wid their ways. Ye see, sorr,\r\nhe comes up an' he nips that fish be the tail, an' away wid him to a\r\nconvanient spot for to turn him an' swallow him head first, by rason of his\r\nsthickles an' fins all p'intin' the other way. Whin he takes it, sorr, jist\r\nlet him run away wid it as far as he likes, but the minit he turns to\r\nswallow it, an' says to himself, 'What an illigant breakfast this is, to be\r\nsure!' that minit slap the hook into his jaw, an' hould on to him for dear\r\nlife.\"\r\n\r\nThese excellent instructions I obeyed with no little difficulty. My cork\r\ncame up in the back water under the rock on which I stood, and there,\r\nalmost at my very feet, it disappeared. I could not believe that a bass had\r\ntaken it, but all doubt on the subject was dispelled by the shrill whir of\r\nmy reel as the fine silk line spun out at a tremendous rate. The fish had\r\ndarted across the current, and only stopped after he had taken out over two\r\nhundred feet of line.\r\n\r\n\"Now, sorr, jist make a remark to him,\" whispered Mr. McGrath; and I struck\r\nas hard as I could. \"Illigant, begorra!\" said he as the fish, maddened and\r\nfrightened, leaped out of the water. \"Look at him looking for a dentist,\r\nbedad!\"\r\n\r\nIt was peculiarly delightful to feel that fish pull--to get a firm hand on\r\nhim, and have him charge off with an impetuosity that involved more line or\r\nbroken tackle--to feel that vigorous, oscillating pull of his, and to note\r\nthe ease and strength with which he swam against the powerful current or\r\ndashed across the boiling eddy below.\r\n\r\nIt did not last long, however: he soon spent himself, and Mr. McGrath\r\nreceived him with a graceful swoop of his landing-net and secured him. Four\r\nmore soon followed, all large fish--two to the credit of Mr. McGrath and\r\ntwo to myself. When caught they are of a dark olive-green on the back and\r\nsides, the fins quite black at the ends, and the under side white. They\r\nchange color rapidly, and as their vitality decreases become paler and\r\npaler, turning when dead to a very light olive-green. The mouth in general\r\nform resembles that of the salmon family, but the size is much larger in\r\nproportion to the weight of the fish, and the arrangement of the teeth is\r\ndifferent. With its great strength and its \"game\" qualities it is not\r\nsurprising that it should afford a good deal of what is known as \"sport.\"\r\n\r\nAn attribute of man which is equivalent to a strong natural instinct is his\r\ndisposition to \"do murder.\" This may account for his love of \"sport,\" or it\r\nmay only be an hereditary trait derived from the period when he had not yet\r\nconcerned himself with agriculture, but slew wild beasts and used his\r\nimplements of stone to crack their bones and get the marrow out. The\r\ninstinct to slay birds, beasts and fishes is certainly strong within us,\r\nwhatever be its remote origin, and it is very little affected by what we\r\nare pleased to call our civilization. Indeed, it is hardly to be believed\r\nthat one of the primitive lords of creation, stalking about in the\r\ncondition of gorgeous irresponsibility incident to the Stone Period, would\r\nhave lowered himself to the level of the kid-gloved example of the present\r\nstage of evolution who fishes in Maine. It cannot be supposed that the\r\npre-historic gentleman would have disgraced himself by catching fish he\r\ncould not use. He never caught ten times as many of the _Salmo fontinalis_\r\nas he and all his friends could eat, and then threw the rest away to rot.\r\nThis kind of thing has prevailed to a great extent, but natural causes have\r\nnearly brought it to an end. The wholesale slaughter of the fish has\r\nreduced their numbers, and a surfeit of indecent sport can no longer be\r\nindulged in. Such fishermen should be confined by law to a large aquarium,\r\nin which the fish they most affected could be taught to undergo catching\r\nand re-catching until the gentlemen had had enough. The fish might grow to\r\nlike it eventually, and submit as a purely business matter to being caught\r\nregularly for a daily consideration in chopped liver and real flies. But\r\nhow our ancestor, just alluded to, would despise the sport of this\r\nprogressive age! With his primitive but natural acceptation of Nature's law\r\nof supply and demand, what would he think of the gentlemen who killed fish\r\nto rot in the sun or drove a few thousand buffaloes over a precipice--all\r\nfor sport? It is probably the propensity to \"do murder\" which accounts for\r\nthese things, for \"sport,\" within decent and proper limits, is a good\r\nthing, and has been favored by the best of men in all ages--fishing\r\nparticularly, because it predisposes to pleasant contemplation, to equity\r\nof criticism in the consideration of most matters of life, and to no little\r\nself-benignancy. No one knew this better (although Shakespeare himself was\r\na poacher) than Christopher North, and where more fitly could the brightest\r\npages of the _Noctes Ambrosianæ_ have been conceived or inspired than when\r\ntheir author was, rod in hand, on the banks of a brawling Highland\r\ntrout-stream?\r\n\r\nThe fish had ceased to bite where we were, and at Mr. McGrath's suggestion\r\nwe dropped down the stream to where my friend and his darkey were. His\r\nexperience with the flies had been similar to mine, but he had too much\r\nregard for his fine fly-rod, he said, to use it for \"slinging round a bait\r\nas big as a herring.\" He had taken it to pieces and put it away. He was\r\nsitting with his elbows on his knees and a brier-root pipe in his mouth,\r\ncontent in every feature, a perfect picture of Placidity on a Boulder.\r\n\r\n\"Given up fishing?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"Not much,\" he replied: \"I've caught nine beauties. Pete does all the work,\r\nand I catch the fish.\"\r\n\r\nSure enough, he had Pete, who was one of the best fishermen on the river,\r\nfishing away as hard as he could. Whenever Pete hooked a fish my friend\r\nwould lay down his pipe and play the fish into the landing-net. \"It's\r\nbeastly sport,\" he said: \"if I wasn't so confoundedly lazy I couldn't stand\r\nit at all.--Hello, Pete! got him?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sah--got him shuah;\" and Pete handed him the rod as the line spun\r\nout. We watched the short struggle, and started down stream, leaving him to\r\nhis laziness just as he was settling back in the boat for a nap and telling\r\nPete not to wake him up unless the next was a big one.\r\n\r\nBy noon we had thirty-two fish--a very fair and satisfactory experience. We\r\nwere about to change our position when we were detained by a tremendous\r\nshouting from the other boat, about half a mile above us.\r\n\r\n\"What's the matter with them, McGrath?\" said I.\r\n\r\n\"Bedad, sorr! I think it must be that bucket there in the bow,\" he replied,\r\npointing to the article, which contained our luncheon.\r\n\r\nI was quite satisfied that it was, and there being a cool spring about\r\nforty feet above us on the bank on the Virginia side, we disembarked. In\r\nthe excitement of fishing I had not thought of luncheon, but now I found I\r\nhad a startling appetite. So had my friend and his assiduous darkey when\r\nthey came in and reported twenty fish.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" he said, \"I know we ought to have a good many more, but Pete is so\r\nlazy. It was all I could possibly do to catch those myself.\"\r\n\r\nWith a flat rock for a table, the grass to sit upon, and the bubbling music\r\nof the little stream that flowed from the spring as an accompaniment, the\r\nham and bread and butter, the pickles and the hard-boiled eggs, and even\r\nthe pie with its mysterious leather crust and its doubtful inside of dried\r\npeaches, tasted wonderfully well. We did not venture out upon the river\r\nagain until three o'clock, our worthy guides agreeing that the fish do not\r\nbite well between noon and that hour, and both of us being disposed to rest\r\na little. My friend stretched himself on the thick grass, and when his pipe\r\nwas exhausted went fast asleep, and snored with great precision and power\r\nto a mild sternutatory accompaniment by Mr. McGrath and Pete. I employed\r\nmyself in bringing up my largest bass from the boat to sit for his picture\r\nin a little basin in the rock under the spring. After he had floundered\r\nhimself into a comparatively rational and quiet condition, much after the\r\nfashion of a gentleman reluctant to have his portrait taken under the\r\nauspices of the police, I succeeded in committing him to paper. He was a\r\nhandsome fish, and eminently deserving of the distinction thus conferred\r\nupon him.\r\n\r\nSleeping in the grass on a summer afternoon is a bucolic luxury I never\r\nfully appreciated. When I stirred up my friend he was red, perspirational\r\nand full of lively entomological suspicions. He slapped the legs of his\r\npantaloons vigorously in spots, moved his arms uneasily, took off his\r\nshirt-collar and implored me to look down his back.\r\n\r\n\"There's nothing there,\" I reported. \"I know how it is myself: a fellow\r\nalways feels that way when he goes to sleep in the grass.\"\r\n\r\n\"Any woodticks here?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Begorra! plenty,\" said Mr. McGrath, sitting up. \"They et a child,\" he\r\nadded with perfect seriousness of manner, \"down here below last summer.\"\r\nMcGrath's eyes twinkled when my friend began to talk of peeling off and\r\njumping into the river after a general search. He was finally reassured,\r\nand we started out. We had even better sport than in the morning, and\r\naccumulated a splendid string of fish each. On the way down we passed two\r\nboats in which were some gentlemen, evidently foreigners, engaged in\r\nthrowing flies with apparently the same results that we had attained in the\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\n\"Do you know who those people are?\" I asked McGrath.\r\n\r\n\"I dunno, sorr,\" said he, \"but I think they are from one of the legations\r\nat Washington. They come up for a day's fishin' all along of the illigant\r\nfishin' a party from the same place had one day last week I suppose;\" and\r\nhe smiled.\r\n\r\n\"How was that, McGrath?\"\r\n\r\n\"It wor last week, sorr; and I wor up the river be meself, an' I had thirty\r\nilligant fish thrailin' undher the boat comin' down. It wor just where they\r\nare I seen two boats full of gintlemen, an' I dhropped alongside. They wor\r\nswells, sure. They had patint rods, an' patint reels, an' patint flies, an'\r\npatint boots, an' patint coats, an' patint hats, an' the divil knows what.\r\nBedad! they wor so fine that sez I to meself, sez I, 'Bedad! if I wor a\r\nbass I'd say, \"Gintlemen, don't go to no throuble on my account: I'll git\r\ninto the boat this minit.\"'--'Been fishin', me man?' sez one of them to me.\r\n'Sorra much, yer honor,' sez I.--'It's very strange, you know,' sez he,\r\n'that they don't bite at all to-day. You haven't caught any, have\r\nyou?'--'Well, sorr,' sez I, 'I did dhrop on a few little ones as I come\r\ndown.'--'Oh, did you, really?' sez another one, puttin' a glass in his eye\r\nand standin' up excited like. 'Why, my good man,' sez he, 'be good enough\r\nto 'old them up, you know.

Well, they were that wild they didn't know what to make of\r\nit. One of them sez, sez he, 'The beggar's been a hauling of a net, he\r\nhas.'--'Divvle a bit more than yerself,' sez I. 'There's me impliments,\r\nan', what's more, if ye wor to stay here till next week the sorra fish can\r\nye ketch, because, bedad! ye dunno how.' Wid that they put their heads\r\ntogether, and swore it ud disgrace them to go home to Washington without a\r\nfish, you know; an' how much would I take for the lot? Sez I, 'I have\r\ntwenty-five more down here in a creel in the river: that's fifty-five,' sez\r\nI. 'Ye can have the lot for twinty dollars.'--'It's a go,' sez he; an' ever\r\nsince that there's letters comin' up from Washington askin' if the wather\r\nis in good ordher, and what is the accommodations? Bedad!

EGAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA LAW UNTO HERSELF.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n\r\nMiss Fleming arrived that evening while Jane was on the water. She was in\r\nthe habit of coming out to the Hemlock Farm for a day's holiday, and went\r\ndirectly to her own room as though she were at home. When she stepped\r\npresently out on the porch, where the gentlemen had gone to smoke, a soft\r\nblack silk showing every line of her supple figure, glimpses of the rounded\r\narms revealed with every movement of the loose sleeves, one or two thick\r\ngreen leaves in her light hair--ugly, quiet, friendly--they all felt more\r\nat home than they had done before. There was a pitcher of punch by the\r\ncaptain's elbow: she tasted it, threw in a dash of liquor, poured him out a\r\nglass and sat down beside him, and he felt that a gap was comfortably\r\nfilled.\r\n\r\n\"You have turned your back on Philadelphia, they tell me, Miss Fleming,\"\r\ncomplained Judge Rhodes. \"New York sucks in all the young blood of the\r\ncountry--the talent and energy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I came simply to sell my wares. New York is my market, but\r\nPhiladelphia will always be home to me,\" in her peculiar pathetic voice. \"I\r\nleft good friends there,\" with one of her bewildering glances straight into\r\nthe judge's beady eyes, at which his flabby face was suffused with heat.\r\n\r\n\"You do not forget your friends, that's certain,\" he said, lowering his\r\nvoice. \"That was a delicate compliment, sending my portrait back to the\r\nExhibition. I felt it very much, I assure you.\"\r\n\r\nCornelia bowed silently. Neither she nor the judge said anything about the\r\nround-numbered cheque which he had sent her for it. In the moonlight they\r\npreferred to let the affair stand on a sentimental basis.\r\n\r\nMr. Van Ness meanwhile eyed Miss Fleming's pose and rounded figure with a\r\nwatery gleam of complacency.\r\n\r\n\"An exceptional woman,\" was his verdict. He turned the conversation to art,\r\nand asked innumerable questions with a profound humility. Cornelia replied\r\neagerly, until the fact crept out from the judge that there was not an\r\næsthetic dogma nor a gallery in the world with which he was not familiar.\r\nThen to pottery, in which field his modesty was as profound, until the\r\njudge pushed him, as it were, to a corner, when he acknowledged himself the\r\npossessor of a few \"nice bits.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have some old Etruscan pieces which I should like you to see, Miss\r\nFleming,\" with his mild, deprecating cough, \"and a bit of Capo di Monte,\r\nand the only real specimen of Henri Deux in the country.\"\r\n\r\n\"I must see them,\" emphatically. \"Where are your cabinets?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, nowhere,\" with a shrug. \"My poor little specimens have never been\r\nunpacked since I returned to this country. They are boxed up in a friend's\r\ncellar.\"\r\n\r\n\"God bless me, Cornelia!\" cried the captain in a muffled tone, \"how could\r\nMr. Van Ness spend his time koo-tooing to cracked pots? He has, as I may\r\nsay, the future of Pennsylvania in his hand. When I think what he is doing\r\nfor the friendless children--thousands of'em--\" The punch had heated the\r\ncaptain's zeal to the point where words failed him.\r\n\r\nAfter that the friendless children swept lighter subjects out of sight. Mr.\r\nVan Ness, whose humility in this light rose to saintly heights, had all the\r\nstatistics of the Bureaux of Charity at his tongue's end. He had studied\r\nthe Dangerous Classes in every obscure corner of the world. He could give\r\nyou the _status quo_ of any given tribe in India just as easily as the\r\ntime-table on the new railway in Egypt. No wonder that he could tell you in\r\na breath the percentage of orphans, deserted minors, children of vicious\r\nparents, in his own State, and the amount _per capita_ required to civilize\r\nand Christianize them. As he talked of this matter his eyes became\r\nsuffused with tears. The great Home for these helpless wards of the State\r\nhe described at length, from its situation on a high table-land of the\r\nAlleghanies and the dimensions of the immense buildings down to the\r\nemployments of the children and the capacity of the laundry--a perfect\r\nArcadia with all the modern improvements, where Crime was to be transformed\r\nwholesale into Virtue.\r\n\r\n\"Where is this institution?\" asked Miss Fleming. \"It is strange I never\r\nheard of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, it is not built as yet: we have not raised the funds,\" Mr. Van Ness\r\nreplied with a smothered sigh.\r\n\r\nThe judge patted one foot and looked at him compassionately. It was a\r\ndevilishly queer ambition to be the savior of those dirty little wretches\r\nin the back alleys. But if a man had given himself up, body and soul, to\r\nsuch a pursuit, it was hard measure that he must be thwarted in it.\r\n\r\nMiss Fleming also bent soft sympathetic eyes on her new friend. The Home\r\nwas not built, eh? Not a brick laid? She wondered whether that box with the\r\npriceless treasures existed in his friend's cellar or in his brain: she\r\nwondered whether he had not seen those pictures of the old masters in\r\nphotographs, or whether he had travelled in Japan and the obscure corners\r\nof the earth in the flesh or in books. There was more than the wonted\r\nnecessity upon her to establish sympathetic relations with this new man:\r\nshe had never seen a finer presence: the beard and brow quite lifted his\r\nmasculinity into æsthetic regions; she caught glimpses, too, of an\r\nunfamiliar mongrel species of intellect with which she would relish\r\nPlatonic relations. Yet with this glow upon her she regarded the reformer's\r\nnoble face and benignant blond beard doubtfully, thinking how she used to\r\nstick pins in brilliant bubbles when she was a child, and nothing would be\r\nleft but a patch of dirty water.\r\n\r\n\"Jane is out on the river, as usual?\" she asked presently.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said her father: \"Mr. Neckart is with her. Neither of them will ever\r\nstay under a roof if they can help it. They ought to have a dash of Indian\r\nblood in their veins to account for such vagabondizing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is Bruce Neckart here?\" with a change in her tone which made the captain\r\nlook up at her involuntarily.\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought he was in Washington: I did not expect to meet him.\"\r\n\r\nThe judge puffed uneasily at his cigar. He was a family man, with a stout\r\nwife and married son. He did not meet Miss Fleming once a year, but he felt\r\na vague jealousy of Neckart.\r\n\r\n\"By the way, you must be old acquaintances?\" he said abruptly. \"Both from\r\nDelaware? Kent county?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes,\" with a shrill womanish laugh, very different from her usual sweet\r\nboyish ha! ha! \"Many's the day we rowed on the bay or dredged for oysters\r\ntogether, dirty and ragged and happy. There is not very much difference in\r\nour ages,\" seeing his look of surprise. \"I look younger than I am, and\r\nBruce has grown old fast. At least, so I hear. I have not seen him for\r\nyears.\"\r\n\r\nShe was silent after that, and preoccupied as her admirers had never seen\r\nher, and presently, hearing Jane's and Neckart's steps on the path, she\r\nrose hastily and bade them good-night. They each shook hands with her, that\r\nbeing one of the sacred rites in the Platonic friendships so much in vogue\r\nnow-a-days among clever men and women. Mr. Van Ness offered his hand last,\r\nand Cornelia smiled cordially as she took it. But it was clammy and soft.\r\nShe rubbed her fingers with a shudder of disgust as she hurried up to her\r\nown room. There she walked straight to her glass and turned up the lamp\r\nbeside it, looking long and fixedly at her face. She knew with exactness\r\nthe extent of its ugliness and its power.\r\n\r\n\"It is too late now even if it ever could have been,\" she said quietly, and\r\nput out the light. Then she went to the window. Mr. Neckart had left Jane\r\ninside, and, not joining the other men, turned back to the garden. She saw\r\nthe bulky dark figure as it passed under her window.\r\n\r\nShe stretched out her hands as if for a caress, with the palms pressed\r\nclose. \"Oh, Bruce!\" she said under her breath. \"Bruce!\"\r\n\r\nAfter he had passed out of sight she stood thinking over all the men who\r\nhad made a comrade of her since she saw him last--how they had handled her\r\nfingers and looked into her eyes; how her every thought and fancy had grown\r\ncommon and unclean through much usage; how she had dragged out whatever\r\nmaidenly feeling she had in the old times, and made capital of it to bring\r\nthese companions to her who were neither lovers nor friends.\r\n\r\n\"When I could not have the food which I wanted. I took the husks which the\r\nswine did eat,\" she said, leaving the window, with a short laugh. \"Well, I\r\ncould not die of starvation.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Jane woke the next morning a bluebird was singing outside of the\r\nwindow: she tried to mimic him before she was out of bed, and sang scraps\r\nof songs to herself as she dressed. The captain heard her in his room\r\nbelow, but pretended to be asleep when she came down as usual to lay out\r\nhis clothes, for, although she insisted that her father should have Dave as\r\na valet, she left him but little to do.\r\n\r\nWatching her from under the covers, the captain saw that she had left off\r\nthe black snood and tied her hair with a band of rose-colored ribbon. Her\r\nlips were ruddy and her eyes alight: once or twice she laughed to herself.\r\n\r\n\"What high day or holiday is it, Jane?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, every day is a high day now!\" running to kiss him. \"I was just\r\nthinking how comfortable money is, and how glad I am that we have it,\"\r\nglancing about delighted at his luxurious toilet appointments before the\r\nlow wood-fire. Then she spread out his dressing-gown and velvet\r\nsmoking-cap, and eyed with her head on one side the fine shirt and its\r\ncostly studs.\r\n\r\n\"Do you remember the rag-carpet in your room which we thought such a\r\ntriumph? and the old tin shaving-cup? Now, my lord, look out upon your\r\nestate!\" opening the window. \"Your musicians have come to waken you, and\r\nyour servitors stand without,\" as Buff tapped at the door with hot water.\r\n\r\n\"He is as comfortable as a baby wrapped in lamb's wool,\" she thought as she\r\nran down the stairs. \"And this air is so pure and the sun so bright! Oh, he\r\nmust grow strong here! Anybody would be cured here--anybody!\"\r\n\r\nThe captain followed her to the barnyard. It was one of her inexorable\r\nprescriptions for him that he should drink a glass of warm milk-punch\r\nbefore breakfast, and smell the cow's breath during the operation. She was\r\nmilking the white cow herself, while the pseudo sempstress, Nichols, waited\r\nwith the goblet, and the bandy-legged shoemaker, Twiss, stood on guard,\r\neyeing Brindle's horns suspiciously.\r\n\r\n\"Now the glass! These are the strippings. Oh you'll soon learn, Betty!\r\nYou'll make butter as well as you used to make dresses badly.\"\r\n\r\nThe little widow and Twiss laughed, as they always did at Jane's weak\r\njokes, and took the punch to the captain. She was the finest wit of her day\r\nin their eyes. The hostler's boy ran down from the stable to speak to her.\r\nShe thought he had as innocent a face as she had ever seen. No doubt he\r\nwould have gone to perdition if Neckart had not rescued him. She stopped to\r\ntalk to him with beaming eyes, and meeting Betty's toddling baby took it up\r\nand tossed it in the air, and then walked on, carrying the soft little\r\nthing in her arms. The farm was like the Happy Valley this morning! God was\r\nso good to her! She could warm and comfort all these people. Then she\r\nturned into the woods and sat down on a fallen log. It was the place where\r\nthey had stopped to rest yesterday, Neckart lying at her feet. There was\r\nthe imprint still in the dead moss where his arm had lain. She looked\r\nguiltily about, and then laid her hand in the broken moss with a quick\r\npassionate touch. The baby caught her chin in its fingers. She hugged it to\r\nher breast, and kissed it again and again. From the hemlock overhead a\r\ntanager suddenly flashed up into the air with a shrill peal of song. Jane\r\nlooked up, her face and throat dyed crimson. Did he know? She glanced down\r\nat the grass, at the friendly trees all alive with rustling and chirping.\r\nThe sky overhead was so deep and warm a blue to-day. It seemed as if they\r\nall knew that he loved her.\r\n\r\nThe captain found Mr. Neckart standing on the stoop listening to some sound\r\nthat came up from the woods.\r\n\r\n\"It is Jane singing,\" he said. \"You would not hear her once in a year.\r\nHereditary gift! In the old Swedish annals we read of the remarkable voices\r\nof the Svens.\"\r\n\r\n\"I never heard her sing before.\" Yet he had known at once that it was she.\r\nIt was the most joyous of songs, but there was a foreboding pathos in the\r\nvoice which moved him as no other sound had ever done.\r\n\r\n\"You are not going before breakfast?\" cried the captain.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and I shall not be able to come again for a long time. Say to Miss\r\nSwendon--But no. I will go and bid her good-bye.\"\r\n\r\nHe met her as she was crossing the plank thrown across the brook, and they\r\nstopped by the little hand-rail, not looking directly at each other: \"I\r\ncame to bid you good-morning.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you take the early train, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\" He did not mean to tell her that he would not come again. The more\r\nordinary their parting the sooner she would forget it and him. He had\r\nthought the matter out during the night, and being a man who was apt to\r\nunder-rate himself, was convinced that the feeling which she had betrayed\r\nwas but that transient flush of preference which any very young and\r\ninnocent girl is apt to give to the first man of whom she makes a\r\ncompanion.\r\n\r\n\"There is nothing in me likely to win enduring love from her. A more\r\nintellectual woman, indeed--\" He had gone over the argument again and\r\nagain. When he was out of sight her fancy would soon turn to this new\r\nlover, so much better suited to her in every respect. For himself--But he\r\nhad no right, to think of himself. He struck that thought down fiercely\r\nagain as they stood together on the bridge. No more right than he would\r\nhave, were he dead, to drag down this young creature into his grave.\r\n\r\nHe patted the child on the head as it clung to her dress, and talked of the\r\nchance of more rain with perfect correctness and civility; and when Jane\r\nmanaged to raise her eyes to his face she found it grave and preoccupied,\r\nas it usually was over the morning papers. He saw Van Ness coming smiling\r\nto meet her.\r\n\r\n\"It is time for me to go,\" he said, his eyes passing slowly over her: then\r\nwith a hasty bow, not touching her hand, he struck through the woods to the\r\nstation, thinking as he went how she was standing then on the bridge in the\r\nsunshine, with the man whom she would marry beside her. She looked after\r\nhim, her eyes full of still, deep content. He loved her. She had forgotten\r\neverything else.\r\n\r\n\"A perfect morning, Miss Swendon,\" said Mr. Van Ness, stroking his\r\nmagnificent golden beard. \"You see just this deep azure sky above the\r\nSandwich Islands. Now, I remember watching such a dawn on Mauna Loa. Ah-h,\r\n_you_ would have appreciated that. Our friend has gone, eh? Most active,\r\nenergetic man! I heard him tell your father he should not return soon\r\nagain.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not return?\" stopping in her slow walk.\r\n\r\n\"No. It really must be impossible for an editor to spare time often for\r\nvisits to even such an Arcadia as this. No stock market or political news\r\nin Arcadia, eh?\" with a benevolent gurgle of a laugh. \"Business! business!\r\nMiss Swendon. Ah, how it engrosses the majority of men!\" shaking his head\r\nponderously.\r\n\r\nShe said nothing. It was as if she had been suddenly wakened out of a dream\r\nin the crowd of a dusty market-place. He had gone back to the world, to his\r\nreal business and his real trouble. She, with her love and her intended\r\ncure for him, was a silly fool wandering in a fantastic Arcadia.\r\n\r\nMiss Fleming was walking up and down on the porch as they came up, more\r\ncarefully dressed than usual. The captain had just told her that Neckart\r\nhad gone.\r\n\r\n\"Ah? I'm very sorry,\" carelessly. \"I should have been glad to see him\r\nagain. Though no doubt he has forgotten me.\"\r\n\r\nShe went forward to meet Jane with a smile, but a withered gray look under\r\nher eyes. \"I have been making a tour of your principality,\" she said as\r\nthey went in to breakfast. \"I see you have brought out a colony of\r\nPhiladelphia paupers. Twiss, and Betty, and the rest.\"\r\n\r\n\"They were not paupers,\" said Jane, taking her place behind the urn. \"Did\r\nyou see into what a great boy Top has grown? And Peter?\" It gave her a warm\r\nglow at heart to remember these people just now. At least, there her care\r\nhad not been fantastic or thrown away.\r\n\r\n\"I hardly expected you to take up the rôle of guardian angel. It requires\r\nstudy, after all, to play it successfully,\" pursued Cornelia with an\r\namiable smile, cutting her butter viciously.--\"Very young girls are apt to\r\nbe impetuous in their charities, and damage more than they help,\" turning\r\nto the judge. \"These poor people, for instance. Betty had her kinsfolk\r\nabout her in Philadelphia, her church and her gossips. She complained\r\nbitterly to me this morning that she 'had no company here but the cows:\r\nMiss Swendon might as well have whisked her off into a haythen desart.'\"\r\n\r\n\"She complained to you!\" cried the captain. \"Why, the trouble and money\r\nwhich Jane has given to that woman and her family! They were starving, I\r\nassure you!\"\r\n\r\nJane listened at first with her usual quiet good-humor. Miss Fleming's\r\nwaspish temper generally amused her, as it would have done a man (if he was\r\nnot her husband). But she began to grow anxious.\r\n\r\n\"You really think Betty is not contented here?\" her hand a little unsteady\r\nas she poured the cream into the cups.\r\n\r\n\"Contented? She seems miserable enough. Home is home, you know, if it is\r\nonly a cellar and starvation. But perhaps\"--with a shrug--\"that class of\r\nIrish are never happy without a grievance. Now, Twiss, it appears to me,\r\nhas just ground for complaint.--A shoemaker,\" turning to the judge a face\r\nbeaming with fun, \"whom this young lady has transported and set down in\r\ncharge of gardens and hot-houses. He does not know a hoe from a mower, and\r\nhe is too old to learn. He had a good trade: now he has nothing.\"\r\n\r\n\"But he could not live by his trade,\" cried Jane.\r\n\r\n\"Well, cobbling is looking up now. In any case, you have pauperized him.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's bad--bad! Now, in Virginia we used to feed everybody who came\r\nalong!\" said the judge, shaking his head. \"But I've learned wisdom in the\r\ncities. Every bit of bread given to a beggar degrades human nature and rots\r\nsociety to the core.\"\r\n\r\n\"But suppose he is starving?\" urged the captain. \"The Good Samaritan wasn't\r\nafraid of pauperizing that poor devil on the road.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let him starve. He will have preserved his self-respect. The Good\r\nSamaritan knew nothing of political economy, sir.\"\r\n\r\nJane left her breakfast untasted. She understood nothing about political\r\neconomy, but she saw that she had done irreparable injury to these people\r\nwhom she had tried to serve--God knew with what anxiety and tenderness of\r\nheart. In one case, at least, there had been no mistake.\r\n\r\n\"Did you see Phil?\" she said, turning with brightening countenance to Miss\r\nFleming. \"We intend to have Phil educated. He is such a keen-witted little\r\nfellow.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Fleming laughed outright now: \"Mr. Neckart's protégé? Yes, I saw him.\r\nHe has been stealing tobacco and money from Dave, it appears, ever since he\r\ncame, and was found out this morning. There was a horrible row in the\r\nstable as I passed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course he stole!\" said the judge triumphantly. \"I tell you, the more\r\nefforts you make to reform the dangerous classes the more hardened you will\r\ngrow. It's hopeless--hopeless!\"\r\n\r\nHer other listeners each promptly presented their theory. Like all\r\nintelligent Americans, they were provided with theories on every social\r\nproblem, and were ready to hang it on an individual stable-boy or any other\r\nnail of a fact which might offer. Jane alone sat silent. She did not hear\r\nwhen her father spoke to her once or twice.\r\n\r\n\"You are disappointed,\" Mr. Van Ness's soft soothing voice murmured in her\r\near. \"I know how these baffled efforts chill the heart. I will explain to\r\nyou the machinery which I propose to bring to bear on these classes.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know anything about machinery or classes. Twiss and Betty were\r\nfriends of mine, and I tried to help them, and have failed.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Fleming, who was watching her furtively, saw her dull eyes raised\r\npresently and rest on the captain, who with a red face and bursts of\r\nlaughter was telling one of his interminable stories.\r\n\r\n\"This girl,\" Cornelia said to herself, \"has everything which I have\r\nnot--beauty, wealth, Bruce Neckart's love. Yet she looks at that weak old\r\nman as if he were all that was left her in the world.\" She had put Jane\r\nbefore on the general basis of antipathy which she had to everything in the\r\nworld that was not masculine, but the feeling had kindled since last night\r\ninto active dislike.\r\n\r\nWhen breakfast was over and their guests had gone to their rooms to make\r\nready to meet the train, Jane decoyed the captain away to Bruno's kennel,\r\nwhere he was tied during Mr. Van Ness's stay. Once out of sight she retied\r\nhis cravat, arranged his white hair to her liking, stroked his sunken\r\ncheeks. Here was something actual and real. She knew now that she had never\r\nhad anything that was truly her own but the kind foolish face looking down\r\non her. She never would have anything more. Only an hour ago life had\r\nopened for her wide and fair as the dawn: now it had narrowed to this old\r\nhand in hers, to his breath, that came and went--O God, how feebly!\r\n\r\n\"You are looking stronger to-day, father. You are gaining every day. Oh\r\nthat is quite certain! Very soon we shall have you as well and strong as\r\nyou were at forty.\"\r\n\r\nWhat if she had not had money this last year? He never could have lived\r\nthrough it. God had been kind to her--kind! She pressed his hand to her\r\nbreast with a quick glance out to the bright sky. The Captain saw her chin\r\nquivering. His own thoughts ran partly in the same line as hers.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I'm gaining, no doubt of it. Though I never could have pulled through\r\nthis year if we had had to live in the old way. God bless Will Laidley for\r\nleaving the money as he did!\"\r\n\r\n\"It was not his to leave otherwise!\" she cried indignantly.\r\n\r\n\"Tut, tut, Jane! Of course it was his. By every law. He could have flung it\r\naway where he chose; and he had a perfect right to do it.\"\r\n\r\nIt was not God who had been kind to her, then: it was only that she had\r\nstolen the money?\r\n\r\n\"Come, Jenny: we must go back to the house.\"\r\n\r\n\"In a moment, father. Go on: I will follow you.\"\r\n\r\nShe walked up and down the tan-bark path for a while. She was sure of\r\nnothing. Wherever she had done what seemed to her right and natural, she\r\nwas barred and checked by the world's laws and experience. She had brought\r\nthese starving wretches out of a hell upon earth into this paradise, and\r\neven they laughed at her want of wisdom: the very money which was her own\r\nin the sight of God, and which had lengthened her father's life, ought to\r\nbe given back to-day to the poor, its rightful owners. If there was any\r\nother cause for her to fight blindly against the narrow matter-of-fact\r\nroutine which ruled her life, she did not name it even to herself.\r\n\r\nLooking toward the house, she saw her father escorting their guests to the\r\ngate, where the carriage waited, David resplendent on the box. The captain\r\nwalked with a feeble kind of swagger: his voice came back to her in weak\r\ngusts of laughter. She laid her hand on a tree, glancing about her with a\r\nfirm sense of possession. \"The property is mine,\" she said, \"and I'll keep\r\nit as long as he lives, if all the paupers in the United States were\r\nstarving at the gates!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Van Ness returned to the Hemlock Farm at stated periods during the\r\nsummer. He had, to be plain, sat down before Jane's heart to besiege it\r\nwith the same ponderous benign calm with which he ate an egg or talked of\r\ndeath. There was a bronze image of Buddha in the hall at the Farm, the gaze\r\nof the god fixed with ineffable content, as it had been for ages, on his\r\nown stomach.\r\n\r\nJane went up to it one day after an hour's talk with Mr. Van Ness. \"This\r\ncreature maddens me,\" she said. \"I always want to break it into pieces to\r\nsee it alter.\"\r\n\r\nLittle Mr. Waring, who had come with Van Ness, hurried up as a connoisseur\r\nin bronzes, adjusting his eye-glasses. \"Why, it is faultless, Miss\r\nSwendon!\" he cried.\r\n\r\n\"That is precisely what makes it intolerable.\"\r\n\r\nMuch of Jane's large, easy good-humor was gone by this time. She had grown\r\nthin, was eager, restless, uncertain of what she ought or ought not to do,\r\neven in trifles.\r\n\r\nMr. Waring and Judge Rhodes were both at the Farm now. They ran over to New\r\nYork every week or two. Phil Waring was not a marrying man, but it was part\r\nof his duty as a leader in society to be intimate with every important\r\nheiress or beauty in the two cities. Out of sincere compassion to Jane's\r\nstupendous ignorance he would sit for hours stroking his moustache, his\r\nelbows on his knees, his feet on a rung of the chair, dribbling information\r\nas to the nice effects in the Water-Color Exhibition, or miraculous \"finds\"\r\nof Spode or Wedgwood in old junk-shops, or the most authentic information\r\nas to why the Palfreys had no cards to Mrs. Livingstone's kettledrums,\r\nwhile Jane listened with a quizzical gleam in her eyes, as she did to the\r\nlittle bantam hen outside cackling and strutting over its new egg.\r\n\r\n\"We must have you in society this winter,\" he urged. \"It is a duty you owe\r\nin your position. You have no choice about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are right, Mr. Waring,\" called the captain from the corner where he\r\nsat with Judge Rhodes. \"The child must have friends in her own class.\" He\r\ndropped his voice again: \"The truth is, Rhodes, she has no ties like other\r\ngirls. Her dog and two or three old women and some children--that is all\r\nshe knows of life. It's enough while she has me. But I shall not be here\r\nlong, now. Not many months.\"\r\n\r\nThe eyes of the two men met.\r\n\r\n\"Does she know?\" asked the judge after a while.\r\n\r\n\"No.\" The captain's gaunt features worked: he trotted his foot to some\r\ntune, looking down from the window and whistling under his breath. \"It was\r\nfor this I sent for you,\" he added presently. \"If I could only see her\r\nsettled, married, before I go! She is no more fit to be left alone in the\r\nworld than Bruno.\"\r\n\r\nThe judge shook his head in gloomy assent. His own opinion was that Jane\r\nwould follow her own instincts in a dog-like fashion if her father was out\r\nof the way, and God only knew where they would lead her! He had brought his\r\nown girls, Rose and Netty, with him to visit her, in order that she might\r\nhave a domestic feminine influence upon her. They found, accidentally, that\r\nshe did not know a word of any catechism, and, terrified, loaned her\r\nreligious novels to convert her: she took them graciously, but never cut\r\nthe leaves. There were to them even more heathenish indications in her\r\nhoopless straight skirts: the good little creatures zealously cut and\r\ntrimmed a dress for her from the very last patterns. She put it on, and\r\nstraightway went through bog and brake with Bruno for mushrooms, coming\r\nback with it in tatters. They chattered in their thin falsetto voices the\r\nlast Culpepper gossip into her patient ear--the story of Rosey's balls at\r\nOld Point, and Netty's lovers, all of whom were \"splendid matches until\r\nimpohverished by the war.\" She listened to their chirping with amused eyes,\r\ntapping them, when they were through, approvingly on the head as though\r\nthey were clever canaries. The girls told their father that they \"feared\r\nher principles leaned toward infidelity, and that it was never safe to be\r\nintimate with these original women,\" and had gone home the next day, not\r\nwaiting for the judge. They washed their hands of her, and gloved them\r\nagain, but he still felt responsible for her. After he left the captain he\r\nwent to her, fatherly interest radiant in every feature: \"Mr. Waring is\r\nright, Jane. It is high time that you were taking your part in society.\r\nYour father wishes it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will do whatever he wishes,\" quietly.--\"You did not know us when we\r\nlived in the old house in Southwark, Mr. Waring. We invented our patents\r\nthen. Sometimes we could afford to go to the gallery at the theatre when\r\nthe play was good. Father and the newsboys would lead the clapping. And we\r\nwent once a year in our patched shoes a-fishing for a holiday. Those were\r\ngood times.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perfect child of Nature!\" telegraphed Mr. Waring uneasily to the judge.\r\n\"How Mrs. Wilde will rejoice in you, Miss Swendon! Nature is her specialty.\r\nShe is coming to call this morning.--Miss Swendon,\" turning anxiously to\r\nthe judge, \"can have no better sponsor in society than Mrs. Wilde. She only\r\ncan give the accolade to all aspirants. No amount of money will force an\r\nentrance at her doors. There must be blood--blood. 'Swendon?' she said when\r\nI spoke to her about this call. 'The Swedish Svens? I remember. Queen\r\nChristina's gallant lieutenant was her great-grandfather. Good stock. None\r\nbetter. The girl must belong to our circle.' So, now it is all settled!\"\r\nrubbing his hands and smiling.\r\n\r\n\"Jane is careless,\" said the captain eagerly. \"People of the best fashion\r\nhave called, and she has not even left cards. Her dress too--Now a Paris\r\ngown, fringes and--\"\r\n\r\nThe three men looked at her at that with a sudden imbecile despair, at\r\nwhich she laughed and went out.\r\n\r\nThe captain found her presently down by the boat in which she had heard\r\nNeckart's story. She bailed it out and cleaned it carefully every day, but\r\nshe had never gone on the river in it since that night.\r\n\r\n\"Father,\" stepping ashore, \"what have I done that I must be turned into\r\nanother woman?\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, Jenny, making models and crabbing were well enough for you as a\r\nchild. But, as Waring justly observes, the society to which you belong is\r\ninexorable in its rules for a woman.\"\r\n\r\nShe flung out her arms impatiently, and then clasped them above her head.\r\nIt seemed as if a thousand fine clammy webs were being spun about her.\r\n\r\n\"If you had any especial talent, as Waring says--if you were artistic or\r\nmusical, or concerned in some asylum-work--you could take your own path,\r\nindependent of society. But--\" looking down at her anxiously.\r\n\r\n\"I understand. I don't know what I was made for.\"\r\n\r\nIt was the first time in her life that she had been driven in to consider\r\nherself. She stood grave and intent, saying nothing for some time. Every\r\nother woman had some definite aim. The whole world was marching by, keeping\r\nstep to a neat, orderly little tune. They made calls, they gave alms, they\r\ndressed, all of the same fashion.\r\n\r\n\"Why not be like other people?\" her father was saying, making a burden to\r\nher thought.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know why,\" drearily.\r\n\r\n\"What would you have, Jenny?\" taking her hand in his.\r\n\r\n\"Father, I never loved but one or two people in the world. You and Bruno\r\nand--not many others. I can do nothing outside of them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense! You cannot be a law to yourself, child. God knows I want to see\r\nyou happy!\" his voice breaking. \"But,\" straightening his eye-glasses,\r\n\"Waring says, very justly, you are out of the groove which all other girls\r\nare in.\" He stopped inquiringly, but she did not answer. She was a\r\nstrongly-built woman in mind and body, and just then she felt her strength.\r\nThe blood rushed in a swift current through her veins. Why should she be\r\nhampered with these thousand meaningless, sham duties? She was fit for but\r\none purpose--to serve two men whom she loved. Her father was ill, and he\r\npushed her from him into Society; and Bruce Neckart was alone, and with a\r\nworse fate than death creeping on him, and he--\r\n\r\n\"Why does not Mr. Neckart come to us?\" she asked abruptly. \"It is months\r\nsince I have seen him.\"\r\n\r\n\"His health is failing. There is some trouble of the brain threatened. I\r\nhear that he is going to give up the paper, and is settling up his business\r\nto go to Europe.\" Her question startled him: he watched her with a new keen\r\nsuspicion.\r\n\r\n\"If this must come on him, why should he not come here to bear it? I can\r\nnurse you both. Surely, that is as good work as returning calls or learning\r\nto dress in Parisian style,\" with a short laugh.\r\n\r\nThe captain's face gathered intelligence as he listened. He knew her secret\r\nnow. For a moment he felt a wrench of pity for her. But love, with the\r\ncaptain, had been a sentimental fever ending in a cold ague: he had\r\nexperienced light heats and chills of it many a time since. This wild fancy\r\nof the girl's would speedily burn itself out if judiciously damped. He\r\nwould at once take the matter in hand.\r\n\r\n\"Neckart,\" he said deliberately, eying her to gauge the effect of his\r\nwords, \"is a man of sense and knowledge of the world. He knows his\r\ncondition, and in the little time left to him he attends to his business\r\nand important political affairs, instead of nursing a romantic friendship\r\nwhich cannot serve him, and would only compromise you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Compromise me? I don't understand you, father.\"\r\n\r\n\"A woman could not render such service as you offer except to her betrothed\r\nlover or husband.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, he would understand.\"\r\n\r\n\"But Society, child--\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Society!\" with a laugh. \"But you do not remember!\" clasping her hands\r\non his shoulder. \"If this thing comes upon him--he has looked forward to it\r\nall his life--he has nobody. He is quite alone.\"\r\n\r\n\"At least,\" impatiently, \"you will not be involved. I did not understand\r\nbefore why Bruce had deserted us lately. I see now that he has acted very\r\nproperly. It was not his fault nor yours--this flirtation--preference--or\r\nwhatever you may choose to call it. But Bruce knows the world, and knows\r\njust how long-lived such fancies are, and he intends that it shall be no\r\nhinderance to your marriage--making an excellent match.\"\r\n\r\n\"I marry? Make an excellent match?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. Certainly. What else should you do? Don't look in that way, my\r\ndarling. It frightens me. I'm not strong. It is not death that is coming to\r\nyou, but a good husband. You need not turn so white.\"\r\n\r\n\"And Mr. Neckart planned this for _me?_\"\r\n\r\n\"N-no. I can't say 'planned,' to be accurate. But he agreed in our plan.\r\nWhy, Bruce has common sense. He knows it is the way of the world that a\r\nwoman should marry, and he will be much happier to know that you are the\r\nwife of a good man--good and good-looking too. Much more presentable than\r\nBruce, poor fellow!\"\r\n\r\nThe captain watched her closely as he gave this home-thrust. How a woman\r\ncould turn from that magnificent, devout reformer to any lean, irascible\r\npolitician! Her foot was on the edge of the little skiff. She pushed it\r\ninto the water. While he sat in the boat there that night, with the\r\nmoonlight white about them, while he told her that he loved her, he had\r\nbeen planning this good match for her! There was no such thing as love,\r\nthen, in the world? Or truth? But there was Society and common sense and\r\nthe inexorable rules of propriety. Bruce Neckart represented to her\r\nStrength itself, and he submitted to these rules cheerfully. He was happy\r\nto think of her as the wife of a good, presentable man!\r\n\r\nWhen she had thought of him as going alone with his terrible burden away\r\nfrom her into the wilderness, true to her until the last breath of reason\r\nwas gone, there had been a thrill of delight in the intolerable pain. But\r\nplanning, like finical little Waring, that she should fall snugly into a\r\nfashionable set, Parisian gowns, a suitable marriage!\r\n\r\nJane had not the womanish faculty of thinning every fact or thought that\r\ncame to her into tears or talk. Neckart had gone out of her life. She\r\naccepted the fact at once, without argument. What the loss imported to her\r\nwould assuredly be known only to her own narrow, one-sided mind, and the\r\nGod who had given it to her.\r\n\r\n\"Shall we go to the house, father? Can't you laugh again, and look like\r\nyourself? Why, I will give myself up, body and soul, to Society or\r\nPhilanthropy--anything you choose--rather than see you so shaken.\" She hung\r\non his arm as they went up the path, talking incessantly, and laughing\r\nmore, as even the captain felt, than the jokes would warrant. The moment\r\nwas favorable for introducing the subject he had at heart.\r\n\r\n\"The last train brought out a dozen men to consult Mr. Van Ness,\" he\r\nbegan--\"deputations from church and charitable organizations. 'Pon my soul,\r\nI don't know what Christianity in this country would do without that man!\"\r\n\r\n\"It would wear a very different face,\" absently.\r\n\r\n\"I went with Rhodes to a great revival-meeting in town one night lately,\r\nand Van Ness, of course, was called up on the platform. Rhodes thought he\r\nlooked like one of the apostles in modern dress; and all the ladies near me\r\nsaid that his face beamed with heavenly light. It would have made anybody\r\ndevout to look at him. Are you listening?\" glancing at her abstracted face.\r\n\"You certainly think him remarkably handsome? As to his nose, now?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't suppose anybody could find fault with his nose,\" smiling.\r\n\r\n\"Nor with his manner?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nor with his manner.\"\r\n\r\n\"And yet you are not friends, eh?\" holding his breath for her answer.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" carelessly. \"Mr. Van Ness and I could not be friends.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why? why?\"\r\n\r\n\"How could I tell?\" with a shrug, and looking at Bruno, who was fighting a\r\ncat just then without cause.\r\n\r\nThe captain looked and sighed. It was of no use, he thought, to try to\r\naccount for the prejudices or likings of any of the lower animals.\r\n\r\nMr. Waring met them at the moment in an anxious flutter: \"Mrs. Wilde is\r\nhere. She is coming down the path.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Wilde was a small, plump old lady with a sober, tranquil face framed\r\nin soft puffs of white hair; her dress never rustled or brought itself into\r\nany notice; her language never fell uneasily out of its quiet gait; when\r\nshe spoke to you, you felt that something genuine and happy dominated you\r\nfor the moment.\r\n\r\n\"I followed Mr. Waring here,\" holding out her hand. \"One makes acquaintance\r\nso much more quickly out of doors. I must begin ours by asking for your\r\narm, Miss Swendon. I am fat and scant o' breath, and apt to forget it.\"\r\n\r\nJane drew the puffy hand eagerly through her arm. She would have liked to\r\nsay outright how welcome the motherly presence and the honest voice were to\r\nher just then.\r\n\r\nMrs. Wilde dismissed the captain and Mr. Waring, and the two women sat down\r\nin the arbor, and at once were at ease and at home with each other. Bruno\r\ncame up, eyed and smelled the new-comer, and snuggled down on her skirts to\r\ngo to sleep.\r\n\r\n\"He vouches for me,\" she said nodding. \"You must take me at his valuation.\"\r\n\r\n\"He makes no mistakes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nor do you, I suspect. That reminds me, Miss Swendon. I brought a friend\r\nwith me, and now that I have seen you I mean to bespeak your good-will for\r\nher. She needs just such healthy influence as yours would be.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is she ill?\"\r\n\r\n\"Only in mind. One of those morbid women who must make a drama out of their\r\nlives, and prefer to make it a tragedy. A Madame Trebizoff, an\r\nEnglish-woman who married a Russian prince. She is a widow now, with large\r\nmeans--came to New York a few months ago, and has had much court paid to\r\nher. But her nature makes her always a very lonely woman.\" She spoke\r\nhastily as the trailing of heavy skirts approached on the grass. \"Here she\r\nis, poor thing! Be good to her,\" she whispered before presenting her in\r\nform. Madame Trebizoff was draped in black, with a good deal of lace about\r\nher head and an artificial yellow rose at her throat. Jane went up to her\r\nwith outstretched hand, but when the sallow face turned full on her she\r\nstopped short, looked at it a moment, and then bowed without a word.\r\n\r\n\"It is the materialized spirit!\" But she did not speak, for in a moment she\r\nremembered that she had once taken the bread from the wretched woman's\r\nmouth. She would not do it again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Van Ness came beaming down through the lilacs to the arbor, and was\r\nreceived with much reverence by Mrs. Wilde. She was a devout woman, and\r\nPliny Van Ness's name was in all the churches. They all sauntered back to\r\nluncheon presently, Mrs. Wilde and Jane going before, while Mr. Van Ness\r\nand the Russian princess walked more slowly through the woods, the\r\nforeigner talking with animation and many gestures of American trees, while\r\nthe reformer listened benignly, ineffable calm in his smiling eyes.\r\n\r\n\"You followed me here purposely, Charlotte?\" he said gently as she dilated\r\neloquently on our autumnal foliage.\r\n\r\n\"No. I did not know that you were in New York. But I meant to call upon you\r\nsoon. I have had no money from you since last August.\"\r\n\r\n\"Somebody, apparently, has filled my place as your banker,\" his placid eye\r\nsweeping over the costly dress and be-diamonded fingers.\r\n\r\n\"What is that to you?\" with a sudden shrill passion. \"Once you would have\r\ncared, Pliny. But that was years ago.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. Many years ago,\" buttoning his glove carefully. \"A Russian princess,\r\neh?\" after a short pause. \"You are playing higher than ordinary, Charlotte.\r\nYou'll find it dangerous. I should advise you to keep to begging letters or\r\nthe rôle of medium or literary tramp.\"\r\n\r\n\"One class is as ready to be humbugged as the other. Who knows that better\r\nthan you?\"\r\n\r\n\"In the religious and charitable work to which I have given up my life,\"\r\ndeliberately measuring his words, \"there are few impostors to be met. We\r\nusually detect fraud, with God's help, and do not suffer from it,\r\ntherefore.\"\r\n\r\nShe stopped short, looking at him with blank amazement. Then walked on with\r\na shrug: \"Absolutely! He expects me to believe in him! He believes in\r\nhimself! Can imposture go further than that?\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Wilde, in the distance, caught sight of the two figures as they passed\r\nthrough a belt of sunlight, and smiled contentedly.\r\n\r\n\"I am so glad to bring poor madame under direct religious influence! Mr.\r\nVan Ness is speaking to her with great earnestness, I perceive.\"\r\n\r\nThe Princess Trebizoff scanned the great reformer as they walked,\r\nappraising him, from the measured solemn step to his calm humility of eye.\r\nShe would have relished a passionate scene with him. After terrapin and\r\nchampagne, there was nothing she relished so much as emotion and tears. But\r\nthey had played up to each other so often! The tragedy in their relation\r\nhad grown terribly stale! You could not, she felt, make Hamlet's inky cloak\r\nout of dyed cotton. But he would serve as audience.\r\n\r\n\"I'm growing very tired of good society,\" talking rapidly as usual. \"Now,\r\nyou always enjoyed a dead level, Pliny.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. There's no Bohemian blood in my veins. I was designed for\r\nrespectability.\"\r\n\r\n\"So? I mean Ted shall be respectable,\" with sudden earnestness. \"He is in a\r\nPresbyterian college. I should be glad if he'd go into the ministry. Yes, I\r\nshould. Provided he had a call from God. I'll have no sham professions\r\nfrom Ted,\" her black eyes sparkling. \"You did not ask for the boy. In your\r\nweighty affairs doubtless you forgot there was such a human being.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, indeed. In what institution have you placed Thaddeus?\"\r\n\r\n\"No matter. He's out of your influence, thank God! He never heard your\r\nname. But as for me, I think I'll drop this princess business soon,\"\r\nmeditatively. \"I began down town,\" with a fresh burst of vivacity. \"On the\r\nboarding-house keepers. Last December.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are Madame Varens! Is it possible?\" turning to look at her. \"The\r\npapers were filled with your exploits last winter.\"\r\n\r\n\"Precisely!\" She had a joyous girlish laugh, infectious enough to draw a\r\nsmile from Van Ness.\r\n\r\n\"You are really very clever, Charlotte,\" admiringly.\r\n\r\n\"I made a tour in the West just before that,\" excitedly, patting her hands\r\ntogether. \"Agent for Orphans' Homes in the Gulf States. I wrote a letter of\r\nintroduction from one or two bishops to the clergymen in their dioceses:\r\nthat started me, and the clergy and press passed me through. What a mill of\r\ntea-drinkings and church-gossip I went through! But it was better fun than\r\nthis.\"\r\n\r\nLooking up, she happened to catch the cold, furtive glance with which he\r\nhad listened, and kept her eye fixed on him curiously.\r\n\r\n\"Do you hate me so much as _that?_\" she said with a long breath. \"Well,\"\r\nfrankly, \"it must be intolerable to carry such a millstone about your neck\r\nas I am to you. You know I could pull you down any minute I chose,\" tossing\r\nher head and laughing maliciously. \"No matter how high you had climbed. I\r\noften wonder, Pliny, why you do not rid yourself of me. It could be easily\r\ndone.\"\r\n\r\nThe usually suave tone was harsh and hoarse as he began to speak. He\r\ncoughed, and carefully modulated his voice before he said politely, \"Yes.\r\nBut it would involve exposure unless carefully managed. That is certain\r\ndamnation. There is a chance of safety for the present in trusting to you.\r\nYou were always good-natured, Charlotte. And,\" turning his watery eye full\r\non her, \"you loved me once.\"\r\n\r\n\"Possibly,\" coolly. \"But last year's loves are as tedious reading as last\r\nyear's newspapers. Better trust my good-nature. You show your shrewdness in\r\nthat. I don't interfere with people. The world uses me very well. It's a\r\nhogshead that gives the best of wine--if you know how to tap it.\"\r\n\r\n\"You've tapped it with a will. You go through life perpetually drunk,\" he\r\nthought as she ran lightly before him up the steps. He habitually made such\r\ncomplacent moral reflections upon his companions to himself, and took\r\nspiritual comfort in them.\r\n\r\nThe hall was wide and sunny, made homelike by low seats and growing plants:\r\nit was occupied by half a dozen committee-men, who were waiting impatiently\r\nto see Mr. Van Ness. The princess seated herself, attentive, her head on\r\none side like some bright-eyed tropical bird.\r\n\r\nVan Ness, without even a glance toward her, took up his business of\r\nChristian financier. \"Do not go, I beg,\" as the captain opened the inner\r\ndoor for Rhodes and the ladies to retire. \"Our affairs are conducted in the\r\neyes of the public. Sound integrity has no secrets to keep. That is our\r\npride.--Ah, gentlemen?\"\r\n\r\nThe captain was glad to stay. Surely, Jane would be impressed with the vast\r\ninfluence of this good man. Van Ness did not look at her once. But he saw\r\nnobody but her, and spoke directly to her ear.\r\n\r\nAsylums, workingmen's homes, hospitals, in all of which he was a director,\r\nwere brought up and dismissed with a few hopeful, earnest words. The vast\r\nsystem of organized charities through which the kindly wealthy class touch\r\nthe poor beneath them was opened. Mrs. Wilde, a manager in many of them,\r\njoined in the discussion.\r\n\r\n\"What a useless creature I am!\" thought Jane. \"But the money,\" doggedly,\r\n\"is mine, and I choose to give it to father if the whole world go hungry.\"\r\nShe turned, however, from one representative of these asylums to the other\r\nwith a baited look. Was it this one or that whom she had robbed?\r\n\r\n\"Now, as to Temperance City--_our_ city?\" demanded a puffy little man\r\nimportantly. \"You are the fountain-head of information there. We look to\r\nyou, Mr. Van Ness.\"\r\n\r\n\"You shall have the annual report next week.--Temperance City,\" turning to\r\nRhodes, his balmy gaze aimed straight over her head, \"is a scheme to\r\nprotect people of small means in the churches, especially women, from\r\nwrecking their little all in unwise investments. It is a town on the line\r\nof the Pacific Railroad. Lots are only sold to colonists who are\r\ntee-totallers and members of some church. The stock is owned largely by the\r\nsame class.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, almost altogether!\" cried the little man enthusiastically. \"Mr. Van\r\nNess's name, as you will understand, gives it authority among all religious\r\npeople. We distribute prospectuses at camp-meetings and at all sectarian\r\nseaside resorts. Shares go off this summer like hot cakes. There's nothing\r\nlike religion, sir, to back up business enterprise. There's Stokes, for\r\ninstance. His shoes are sold from New Jersey to Oregon on the strength of\r\nthe hymns he has written.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said the judge solemnly. \"We used to keep religion too much in the\r\nchimney-corner--spoke of it with bated breath. But it's in trade now, sir.\r\nWe hear every day of our Christian shoe-makers and railway kings and\r\nstatesmen. The world moves!\"\r\n\r\n\"Moves? Oh there's no lever like religion!\" gasped the little man. \"No\r\nadvertisement to equal it. And a good man ought to succeed! Are the\r\nswindlers to take all the fat of the land? Does not the good Book say, 'To\r\nthe laborers belong the spoils'?\"\r\n\r\n\"But this is so charming to me!\" cried the princess. \"We foreigners have so\r\nfew opportunities of looking into the workings of your politics and trade!\"\r\n\r\nVan Ness bowed respectfully.\r\n\r\n\"And the State Home for destitute children?\" asked a raw-boned\r\nScotch-Irishman. \"We're interested in that here in New York. We've\r\nsubscribed largely, as you're aware, Mr. Van Ness. May I ask when you wull\r\nbegin the buildin'?\"\r\n\r\n\"In the spring, I trust. If enough funds are collected.\"\r\n\r\n\"And hoo air the funds invested in the mean while?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, in corner-lots in Temperance City.\"\r\n\r\nThe committee-men had hurried away to catch the next train: lunch was over,\r\nand Mr. Van Ness stood apart on the lawn under the drooping branches of a\r\nwillow, when the princess tripped lightly out to him.\r\n\r\n\"You have an object in coming here? You had an object in bringing those men\r\nto-day and opening out your affairs. What is it?\"\r\n\r\nHe regarded her composedly for a moment without answering: \"You always\r\nerred, Charlotte, in ascribing your own skill in intrigue to me. It was a\r\nflattering mistake. What I am to others I am to myself.\"\r\n\r\nShe laughed, a merry, hearty laugh: \"Yes, Pliny, because you are not\r\nsatisfied with cheating the world and the God that made you into the belief\r\nthat you are a Christian, but you parade in your godliness before yourself.\r\nThere is not a spot within you sound enough for your real soul to lodge in.\r\nIt is all like that,\" setting her foot viciously on a fallen apple. \"Rotten\r\nto the core!\"\r\n\r\nA shadow of disgust passed over his handsome face. Van Ness had a\r\nfastidious taste. Her melodramatic poses had been familiar to him for\r\nyears: they always had annoyed and bored him.\r\n\r\n\"What is it that brings you here? A woman?\"\r\n\r\nHe hesitated a moment: \"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"This yellow-haired girl? You mean to marry her?\"\r\n\r\n\"I may marry her,\" cautiously.\r\n\r\nTheir eyes met. \"I did not think you would push me so far,\" she said\r\nthoughtfully.\r\n\r\n\"It is to your interest not to interfere. You are mad, Charlotte. But you\r\nnever lose sight of the dirty dollar in your madness.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is for Ted's sake,\" quietly. \"I dislike that girl. She's so damnably\r\nclean! She's of the sort that would walk straight on and trample me under\r\nfoot like a slug if she knew what I was. I owe her an old grudge, too. But\r\nthat's nothing,\" laughing good-humoredly. \"It was the most ridiculous\r\nscene! But it lost me a year's income. She nearly recognized me to-day. On\r\nthe whole, I'll not interfere. Marry her. She deserves just such a\r\npunishment. By the way, there is my card. You can send the back payments\r\nthat are due, to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\nVan Ness received the card and command with a smile and bow, meant for the\r\nbystanders: \"Of course, Charlotte, you understand that these payments must\r\nsoon stop. I shall rid myself of any legal claims you have upon me before\r\nmarrying another woman.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I've no doubt you'll walk strictly according to law! You will not run\r\nthe risk of a lawsuit, much less prosecution, even for Miss Swendon. You\r\nwill have no trouble in gaining your freedom from me,\" shrilly.\r\n\r\n\"None whatever,\" stripping the leaves from a willow wand. She left him\r\nwithout a word, going to the house.\r\n\r\nMrs. Wilde had just summoned her carriage. \"Where is the princess?\" looking\r\nlazily around.\r\n\r\n\"Is Madame Trebizoff a guest in your house?\" asked Jane suddenly.\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will call her. I have something to say to her.\"\r\n\r\nShe went to meet her with the grave motherly firmness with which she would\r\nhave gone to give a scolding to black Buff or a lazy chambermaid. The\r\nprincess, crossing the grass, slender, dark, sparkling, had no doubt of her\r\nown smouldering passionate hate against her. It was the proper thing for\r\nHagar to hate Sarah. Life was thin and insipid without great remorses,\r\nrevenges, loves. The poor little creature was always aiming at them, and\r\nfalling short. She was wondering now why Jane wore no jewelry. \"Not an\r\nearring! Not a hoop on her finger! If I had her money!\" glancing down at\r\nthe blaze of rubies on her breast.\r\n\r\nThey met under a clump of lilacs.\r\n\r\n\"Stop one moment,\" said Jane, looking down at her not unkindly. \"You must\r\nnot let this go too far, you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean?\" The princess fixed her eye upon her, with a somewhat\r\nsnaky light in it. Indeed, when she assumed that attitude toward Van Ness\r\nor any other man she could frighten and hold him at bay as if she had been\r\na cobra about to strike. But the lithe dark body, the vivid color, the\r\nbeady eye only reminded Jane oddly of a darting little lizard, and tempted\r\nher to laugh.\r\n\r\n\"No. You really must keep within bounds. Because I have my eye upon you. I\r\ncan't let you cheat that good soul, who brought you here, to her damage.\"\r\n\r\nThe princess gasped and whitened as though a cold calm hand was laid on her\r\nmiserable sham of a body.\r\n\r\n\"Do you know who I am?\" stiffening herself into her idea of regal bearing.\r\n\r\n\"Not exactly. It does not matter in the least, either. I took your means of\r\nearning a living from you once, you told me, and I don't wish to do it\r\nagain. I will not interfere as long as you hurt nobody.\"\r\n\r\nThe princess stared at her and burst into an hysteric laugh: \"I believe, in\r\nmy soul, you mean just what you say! You are the shrewdest or stupidest\r\nwoman I ever saw! Do you sympathize with me? Do you feel for me?\"\r\ntragically, \"or are you trying to worm my secret from me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Neither one nor the other,\" coolly. \"I know your secret. You are no spirit\r\nand no princess. I shall pity you perhaps when you go to some honest work.\r\nWhy,\" with sudden interest, \"I can find steady work for you at once. A\r\nstaymaker in the village told me the other day--\"\r\n\r\n\"_I_ make stays!\"\r\n\r\nThey both laughed. Jane's chief thought probably was how bony and sickly\r\nthis poor woman was: her own solid white limbs seemed selfish to her for\r\nthe instant. She took the twitching, ringed fingers in her hand.\r\n\r\n\"Play out your own play,\" she said good-humoredly. \"You will not hurt\r\nanybody very seriously, I fancy.\"\r\n\r\nThey walked in silence to the house.\r\n\r\nThe princess bent forward in the carriage-window as they drove away to look\r\nback at her. \"I wish my son knew such women as that!\" she cried.\r\n\r\n\"Son?\" said the startled Mrs. Wilde. \"You have not spoken before to me of\r\nyour son, madame.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have always kept him under tutors--at Leipsic.\"\r\n\r\nShe leaned back as they drove through the sunshine, her filmy handkerchief\r\nto her painted eyes, seeing nothing but an ugly, honest-faced boy hard at\r\nwork in a bare Presbyterian chapel. He would never know nor guess the life\r\nof shame which his mother led! Her tears were real now.\r\n\r\nShe even had wild, visionary thoughts of a confession, of staymaking, of so\r\nmany dollars a week regularly. But she remembered the time when some fussy,\r\ngood women had put her in charge of a fashionable Kindergarten. There was a\r\nfat salary! The house was luxurious: the teachers did the work. But one\r\nnight she had broken the finical apparatus to pieces, left a heap of\r\nbonbons for the children, scrawled a verse of good-bye with chalk on the\r\nblackboard, and taken to the road again without a penny.\r\n\r\nREBECCA HARDING DAVIS.\r\n\r\n[TO BE CONTINUED.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nALFRED DE MUSSET.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is twenty years since the death of Alfred de Musset, a poet whose\r\npopularity and influence, both in his own country and out of it, can be\r\ncompared only to Byron's. Not that the Frenchman is known in England as the\r\nEnglishman is known in France, but the latter country may be called the\r\nopen side of the Channel, and in establishing a comparison between the\r\nrelative fame and familiarity of foreign names and ideas there and on the\r\nisolated side, it is proportion rather than quantity which must be kept in\r\nview. While Byron is out of fashion in his own country, the rage for\r\nMusset, which for a long time made him appear not so much the favorite\r\nmodern poet of France as the only one, has subsided into a steady\r\nadmiration and affection, a permanent preference. New editions of his\r\nworks, both cheaper and more costly, are being constantly issued, portraits\r\nof him are multiplied, his pieces are regularly performed at the Théâtre\r\nFrançais, his verses are on every one's lips, his tomb is heaped with\r\nflowers on All Souls' Day. Until after his death it would have been easy to\r\ncount those who knew even his name in this country and England: as usual in\r\nsuch matters, we preceded the English in our acquaintance with him. The\r\nfreedom with which Owen Meredith and Mr. Swinburne helped themselves from\r\nhis poems proves how unfamiliar the general public was with him ten years\r\nago, but his distinction is now so well recognized in that island, so\r\nremote from external impressions, that some knowledge of his life and\r\nwritings formed part of the French course last year in the higher local\r\nexaminations of Cambridge University.\r\n\r\nAlfred de Musset belongs to the class of poets whose inner history excites\r\nmost curiosity, because his readers feel that there lies the spring of his\r\npower, the secret of his charm, as well as the key to the riddles and\r\ninconsistencies which his writings present: they are so imbued with the\r\nessence of a common humanity that the heart that beats, the tears which\r\nstart, the blood which courses through them, keep time with our own. The\r\ndesire to penetrate still further into the intimacy to which they admit us\r\nis quite distinct from the vulgar inquisitiveness which pursues celebrity,\r\nor merely notoriety, into privacy. His biography has lately been published\r\nby one who recognizes the true nature of this curiosity: Paul de Musset has\r\nreserved the right of telling his brother's story, regarding it, he says,\r\n\"not only as a duty I owe to the man I loved best, and whose most intimate\r\nand confidential friend I was, but as a necessary complement to the perfect\r\nunderstanding of his works, for his work was himself.\"\r\n\r\nThe way in which this task has been performed is not entirely satisfactory,\r\nand many passionate admirers of the poet, the order of readers to whom it\r\nis dedicated, will feel disappointment and a regretful sense of its failing\r\nto fulfil what it undertook, increased by the conviction that, having been\r\nundertaken by the hand best fitted for it by natural propriety, it cannot\r\nbe done again. The book bears the relation to what one desired and expected\r\nthat a bare diary does to the journal, or memoranda to the lecture. It is a\r\ncollection of notes on the life of Alfred de Musset, rather than a full\r\nmemoir. This inadequacy arises principally from the biographer himself.\r\nPaul de Musset, the poet's elder and only brother, is a man of taste and\r\ncultivation, a judge of art, literature, music and the drama, a person of\r\ncharming manners and conversation, dignified, kindly, courteous, easy: he\r\nwas until middle age a busy, working man, whose leisure moments were\r\noccupied with writings that have found little favor, except the _Femmes de\r\nla Règence_ and the pretty child's story of _M. le Vent et Mme. la Pluie_,\r\nwhich latter has been translated. He was the devoted, unselfish friend and\r\nmentor of Alfred, to whose juniority and genius he extended an indulgence\r\nof which he needed no share for himself: in fact, he was the elder brother\r\nof the Prodigal in everything but want of generosity. A more amiable\r\nportrait cannot be imagined than the one to be drawn of him from the\r\nhistory of his intercourse with his brother and from Alfred's own letters\r\nand verses to him. This, however, was not the person to give us such an\r\naccount and analysis of the life and character of Alfred de Musset as the\r\nsubject called for: he has neither the necessary impartiality nor ability.\r\nHe is now seventy years old, and although, like his brother, he has the\r\ngift of appearing a decade less than his age, he is forced to remember that\r\nthe time must come when he will no longer be here to defend his brother's\r\nmemory, which has suffered more than one cruel attack. Having once had to\r\nsilence calumny under cover of fiction, he naturally wished to put his name\r\nbeyond the reach of being further traduced. Whatever the shortcomings of\r\nthe performance, it could not fail to be interesting. It is written in an\r\neasy, well-bred style, like the author's way of talking--not without a\r\nsense of humor, with touching pride in his brother's endowments, and\r\ntenderness toward faults which he does not deny. In place of comprehensive\r\nviews and sound judgment of Alfred de Musset's genius and career, we have\r\nthe knowledge of absolute intimacy and sympathy, candor, a hoard of\r\nreminiscences and details which could be gained from no other source, and,\r\nmore than all, that certainty as to events and motives which can exist only\r\nwhere there has been a lifelong daily association without disguise or\r\ndistrust.\r\n\r\nThe family of Musset is old and gentle, and was adorned in early centuries\r\nby soldiers of mark and statesmen of good counsel--the sort of lineage\r\nwhich should bequeath high and honorable ideas, an inheritance of which\r\nneither Paul nor Alfred de Musset nor their immediate forbears were\r\nunworthy. A disposition to letters and poetry appears among their ancestry\r\non both sides, beginning in the twelfth century with Colin de Musset, a\r\nsort of troubadour, a friend of Thibaut, count of Champagne, while the\r\npoet's paternal grandmother bore the name of Du Bellay, so illustrious in\r\nthe annals of French literature. Alfred de Musset's parents were remarkable\r\nfor goodness of heart and high principle: both possessed an ideality which\r\nshowed itself with them in elevation of moral sentiments, and which passed\r\ninto the imaginative qualities of their sons. From remoter relatives on\r\nboth sides came a legacy of wit, promptness and point in retort, gayety\r\nand good spirits. Alfred de Musset was born on the 11th of December, 1810,\r\nin the old quarter of Paris, on the left bank of the Seine. The stories of\r\nhis childhood--which are pretty, like all true stories about children--show\r\na sensitive, affectionate, vivacious, impetuous, perverse nature,\r\nprecocious observation and intelligence. He was one of those beautiful,\r\ncaptivating children whom nobody can forbear to spoil, and who, with the\r\ninnocent cunning of their age, reckon on the effect of their own charms. He\r\nwas not four years old when he first fell in love, as such mere babies,\r\nboth girls and boys, occasionally do: these infantine passions exhibit most\r\nof the phenomena of maturer ones, and show how intense and absorbing a\r\npassion may be which belongs exclusively to the region of sentiment and\r\nimagination. Alfred de Musset's first love was his cousin, a young girl\r\nnearly grown up when he first saw her: he left his playthings to listen to\r\nher account of a journey she had made from Belgium, then the seat of war,\r\nand from that day, whenever she came to the house, insisted on her telling\r\nhim stories, which she did with the patience and invention of Scheherazade.\r\nAt last he asked her to marry him, and, as she did not refuse, considered\r\nher his betrothed wife. After some time she returned to her home in Liége:\r\nthere were tears on both sides--on his genuine and excessive grief. \"Do not\r\nforget me,\" said Clélia.--\"Forget you! Don't you know that your name is cut\r\nupon my heart with a pen-knife?\" He set himself to learn to read and write\r\nwith incredible application, that he might be able to correspond with his\r\nbeloved. His attachment did not abate with absence, so that when Clélia\r\nreally married, the whole family thought it necessary to keep it a secret\r\nfrom her little lover, and he remained in ignorance of it for years,\r\nalthough he betrayed extraordinary suspicion and misgiving on the subject.\r\nHe was a schoolboy of eight or nine before he learned the truth, and was at\r\nfirst extremely agitated: he asked tremblingly if Clélia had been making\r\nfun of him, and being assured that she had not, but that they had not\r\nallowed her to wait for him, and that she loved him like an elder sister,\r\nhe grew calm and said, \"I will be satisfied with that.\" The cousins seldom\r\nmet in after-life, but preserved a tender affection for each other, which\r\nserved to avert a lawsuit and rupture that threatened to grow out of a\r\nbusiness disagreement between the two branches of the family. In 1852,\r\nClélia came to Paris to be present at Alfred's reception by the French\r\nAcademy. He had great confidence in her taste and judgment, and the last\r\ntime they met he said to her, \"If there should ever be a handsome edition\r\nof my works, I will have a copy bound for you in white vellum with a gold\r\nband, as an emblem of our friendship.\"\r\n\r\nHis first literary passion was the _Arabian Nights_, which filled the\r\nimagination of both brothers with magical lamps, wishing-carpets and secret\r\ncaverns for nearly a twelvemonth, during which they were incessantly trying\r\nto carry out their fancies by constructing enchanted towers and palaces\r\nwith the furniture of their apartment. The Eastern stories were superseded\r\nby tales of chivalry: Paul lit upon the _Four Sons of Aymon_ in his\r\ngrandfather's library, and a new world opened before him in which he\r\nhastened to lose himself, taking his younger brother by the hand. The\r\nchildren devoured _Jerusalem Delivered_, _Orlando Furioso_, _Amadis de\r\nGaule_, and all the poems, tales and traditions of knighthood on which they\r\ncould lay hands. Their games now were of nothing but tilts and jousts,\r\nsingle combats, adventures and deeds of arms: the paladins were their\r\nimaginary playfellows. A little comrade, who charged with an extraordinary\r\nrush in the excitement of the tournament, generally represented Roland:\r\nAlfred, being the youngest and smallest of the three, was allowed to bear\r\nthe enchanted lance, the first touch of which unseated the boldest rider\r\nand bravest champion--a pretty device of the elder brother's, in which one\r\nhardly knows whether to be most charmed with the poetic fancy or the\r\nprotecting affection which it displayed. The delightful infatuation lasted\r\nfor several years, undergoing some gradual modifications. Until he was\r\nnine, Alfred had been chiefly taught at home by a tutor, but at that age he\r\nwas sent to school, where the first term dispelled his belief in the\r\nmarvellous. His brother was by this time at boarding-school, and they met\r\nonly on Sunday, when they renewed their knightly sports, but with\r\ndiminished ardor. One day Alfred asked Paul seriously what he thought of\r\nmagic, and Paul confessed his scepticism. The loss of this dear delusion\r\nwas a painful shock to Alfred, as it is to many children. Who cannot\r\nremember the change which came over the world when he first learned that\r\nKrisskinkle _alias_ Santa Claus did not fill the Christmas stocking--that\r\nthe fairies had not made the greener ring in the grass, where he had firmly\r\nbelieved he might have seen them dancing in the moonlight if he could only\r\nhave sat up late enough? The Musset children fell back upon the mysterious\r\nmachinery of old romance--trap-doors, secret staircases, etc.--and began\r\ntapping and sounding the walls for private passages and hidden doorways;\r\nbut in vain. It was at this stage of the fever that _Don Quixote_ was given\r\nto them; and it is a singular illustration both of the genius of the book\r\nand the intelligence of the little readers that it put their giants, dwarfs\r\nand knights to flight. During the following summer they passed a few weeks\r\nat the manor-house of Cogners with an uncle, the marquis de Musset, the\r\nhead of the family: to their great joy, the room assigned them had\r\nunderneath the great canopied bedstead a trap leading into a small chamber\r\nbuilt in the thickness of the floor between the two stories of the old\r\nfeudal building. Alfred could not sleep for excitement, and wakened his\r\nbrother at daybreak to help him explore: they found the secret chamber full\r\nof dust and cobwebs, and returned to their own room with the sense that\r\ntheir dreams had been realized a little too late. On looking about them\r\nthey saw that the tapestry on their walls represented scenes from _Don\r\nQuixote:_ they burst out laughing, and the days of chivalry were over.\r\n\r\nAlfred de Musset was nine years old, as we have said, when he began to\r\nattend the Collége Henri IV. (now Corneille), on entering which he took his\r\nplace in the sixth form, among boys for the most part of twelve or upward.\r\nHe was sent to school on the first day with a deep scalloped collar and his\r\nlong light curls falling upon his shoulders, and being greeted with jeers\r\nand yells by his schoolmates, went home in tears, and the curls were cut\r\noff forthwith. He was an ambitious rather than an assiduous scholar, and\r\nkept his place on the bench of honor by his facility in learning more than\r\nby his industry; but it was a source of keen mortification to him if he\r\nfell behindhand. His talents soon attracted the attention of the masters\r\nand the envy of the pupils, the latter of whom were irritated and\r\nhumiliated by seeing the little curly-pate, the youngest of them all,\r\nalways at the head of the class. The laziest and dullest formed a league\r\nagainst him: every day, when school broke up, he was assaulted with a\r\nbrutality equal to that of an English public school, but which certainly\r\nwould not have been roused against him there by the same cause. He had to\r\nrun amuck through the courtyard to the gate, where a servant was waiting\r\nfor him, often reaching it with torn clothes and a bloody face. This\r\npersecution was stopped by his old playfellow, Orlando Furioso, who was two\r\nyears his senior: he threw himself into the crowd one day and dealt his\r\nredoubtable blows with so much energy that he scattered the bullies once\r\nfor all. Among their schoolmates was the promising duke of Orleans, who was\r\nthen duc de Chartres, his father, afterward King Louis Philippe, bearing at\r\nthat time the former title. He took a strong fancy to Alfred de Musset,\r\nwhich he showed by writing him a profusion of notes during recitation, most\r\nof them invitations to dinner at Neuilly, where he occasionally went with\r\nother school-fellows of the young prince. For a time after leaving school\r\nDe Chartres--as he was called by his young friends--kept up a lively\r\ncorrespondence with Alfred, and when their boyish intimacy naturally\r\nexpired the recollection of it remained fresh and lively in the prince's\r\nmind, as was afterward proved.\r\n\r\nDe Musset left college at the age of sixteen, having taken a prize in\r\nphilosophy for a Latin metaphysical essay. His disposition to inquire and\r\nspeculate had already manifested itself by uneasy questions in the classes\r\nof logic and moral philosophy; and although few will agree with his brother\r\nthat his writings show unusual aptitude and profound knowledge in these\r\nsciences, or that, as he says, \"the thinker was always on a level with the\r\npoet,\" nobody can deny the constant questioning of the Sphinx, the eager,\r\nrestless pursuit of truth, which pervades his pages. He pushed his search\r\nthrough a long course of reading,--Descartes, Spinoza, Cabanis, Maine de\r\nBiran--only to fall back upon an innate faith in God which never forsook\r\nhim, although it was strangely disconnected with his mode of life.\r\n\r\nI have lingered over the early years of Alfred de Musset because the\r\nchildhood of a poet is the mirror wherein the image of his future is seen,\r\nand because there is something peculiarly touching in this season of\r\ninnocence and unconsciousness of self in the history of men whose after\r\nlives have been torn to pieces by the storms of vicissitude and passion. So\r\nfar, he had not begun to rhyme--an unusual case, as boys who can make two\r\nlines jingle, whether they be poets or not, generally scribble plentifully\r\nbefore leaving school. At the age of fourteen he wrote some verses to his\r\nmother on her birthday, but it is fair to suppose that they gave no hint of\r\ntalent, as they have not been preserved: it was only from his temperament\r\nthat his destiny might be guessed. The impressions of his infancy were\r\nsingularly vivid and deep, and acted directly upon his imagination: they\r\nare reflected in his works in pictures and descriptions full of grace or\r\npower. The ardent Bonapartism of his family, particularly of his mother,\r\nwhom he loved and revered, took form from his recollections in the\r\nmagnificent opening of the _Confession d'un Enfant du Siècle,_ which has\r\nthe double character of a prose poem and a kindling oration, while by the\r\nvolume and sonorous beauty of the phrase it reminds one of a grand musical\r\ncomposition. When he was between seven and eight years old his family\r\npassed the summer at an old country-place to which belonged a farm, and he\r\nand his brother found inexhaustible amusement among the tenants and their\r\noccupations. He never saw it again, but it is reproduced with perfect\r\nfidelity in the tale of _Margot_. The chivalric mania left, as Paul de\r\nMusset observes, a love of the romantic and fantastic, a tendency to look\r\nupon life as a novel, an enjoyment of what was unexpected and unlikely, a\r\ndisposition to trust to chance and the course of events. The motto of the\r\nMussets was a condensed expression of the gallant love-making, Launcelot\r\nside of knightly existence--_Courtoisie, Bonne Aventure aux Preux_\r\n(\"Courtesy, Good Luck to the Paladin;\" or, to translate the latter clause\r\nmore freely, yet more faithfully to the spirit of the original, \"None but\r\nthe Brave Deserve the Fair\"). It came from two estates--_Courtoisie_, which\r\npassed out of the family in the last century, and _Bonne Aventure_, a\r\nproperty on the Loire, which was not part of Alfred's patrimony. The\r\nfairies who endowed him at his christening with so many gifts and graces\r\nmust have meant to complete his outfit when they presented him with such a\r\ndevice, which might have been invented for him at nineteen. On leaving\r\ncollege he continued his education by studying languages, drawing, and\r\nmusic to please himself, and attempting several professions to satisfy the\r\nreasonable expectations of his father. He found law dry, medicine\r\ndisgusting, and, discouraged by these failures, he fell into low spirits,\r\nto which he was always prone even at the height of his youthful\r\njoyousness--declared to his brother that he was and ever should be good for\r\nnothing, that he never should be able to practise a profession, and never\r\ncould resign himself to being _any particular kind of man._ His talent for\r\ndrawing led him to work in a painter's studio and in the galleries of the\r\nLouvre with some success, and for a time he was in high spirits at the\r\nidea of having found his calling, and pursued it while attending lectures\r\nand classes on other subjects. This uncertainty lasted a couple of years,\r\nduring which he began to venture a little into society, of which, like most\r\nlively, versatile young people, he was extravagantly fond. His Muse was\r\nstill dormant, but his love for poetry was strongly developed; a volume of\r\nAndré Chenier was always in his pocket, and he delighted to read it under\r\nthe trees in the avenues of the Bois on his daily walk out of Paris to the\r\nsuburb of Auteuil, where his family lived at that time. Under this\r\ninfluence he wrote a poem, which he afterward destroyed, excepting a few\r\ngood descriptive lines which he introduced into one of later date.\r\nMeanwhile, he had been presented to the once famous Cénacle, the nucleus of\r\nthe romantic school, then in the pride and flush of youth and rapidly\r\nincreasing popularity; its head-quarters were at the house of Victor Hugo\r\n_facile princeps ordinis_ even among its chiefs. There he met Alfred de\r\nVigny, Mérimée, Sainte-Beuve and others, whose talents differed essentially\r\nin kind and degree, but who were temporarily drawn together by similarity\r\nof literary principles and tastes. Their meetings were entirely taken up\r\nwith intellectual discussions, or the reading of a new production, or in\r\nwalks which have been commemorated by Mérimée and Sainte-Beuve, when they\r\ncarried their romanticism to the towers of Notre Dame to see the sun set or\r\nthe moon rise over Paris.\r\n\r\nStimulated by this companionship, Alfred de Musset began to compose. His\r\nfirst attempt at publication was anonymous, a ballad called \"A Dream,\"\r\nwhich, through the good offices of a friend, was accepted by _Le\r\nProvincial,_ a tri-weekly newspaper of Dijon: it did not pass unnoticed,\r\nbut excited a controversy in print between the two editors, to the extreme\r\ndelight of the young poet, who always fondly cherished the number of the\r\npaper in which it appeared. At length, one morning he woke up Sainte-Beuve\r\nwith the laughing declaration that he too was a poet, and in support of\r\nhis assertion recited some of his verses to that keenly attentive and\r\nappreciative ear. Sainte-Beuve at once announced that there was \"a boy full\r\nof genius among them,\" and as long as he lived, whatever Paul de Musset's\r\nfraternal sensitiveness may find to complain of, he never retracted or\r\nqualified that first judgment. The _Contes d'Italie et d'Espagne_ followed\r\nfast, and were recited to an enthusiastic audience, who were the more\r\nlenient to the exaggerations and affectations of which, as in most youthful\r\npoetry, there were plenty, since these bore the stamp of their own mint.\r\n\r\nAlfred de Musset's first steps in life were made at the same time with his\r\nfirst essays in poetry. He was so handsome, high-spirited and gay that\r\nwomen did not wait to hear that he was a genius to smile upon him. His\r\nbrother, who is tall, calls him of medium height, five feet four inches\r\n(about five feet nine, English measure), slender, well-made and of good\r\ncarriage: his eyes were blue and full of fire; his nose was aquiline, like\r\nthe portraits of Vandyke; his profile was slightly equine in type: the\r\nchief beauty of his face was his forehead, round which clustered the\r\nmany-shaded masses of his fair hair, which never turned gray: the\r\ncountenance was mobile, animated and sensitive; the predominating\r\nexpression was pride. Paul relates without reserve how one married woman\r\nencouraged his brother and trifled with him, using his devotion to screen a\r\nreal intrigue which she was carrying on, and that another, who was lying in\r\nwait for him, undertook his consolation. One morning Alfred made his\r\nappearance in spurs, with his hat very much on one side and a huge bunch of\r\nhair on the other, by which signs his brother understood that his vanity\r\nwas satisfied. He was just eighteen. That a man of respectable life and\r\nnotions like Paul de Musset should take these adventures as a matter of\r\ncourse makes it difficult for an American to find the point of view whence\r\nto judge a society so abominably corrupt. Thus at the age of a college-boy\r\nin this country he was started on the career which was destined to lead to\r\nso much unhappiness, and in the end to his destruction. Dissipation of\r\nevery sort followed, debts, from which he was never free, and the habit of\r\ndrinking, which proved fatal at last. To the advice and warnings of his\r\nbrother he only replied that he wished to know everything by experience,\r\nnot by hearsay--that he felt within him two men, one an actor, the other a\r\nspectator, and if the former did a foolish thing the latter profited by it.\r\nOn this pernicious reasoning he pursued for three years a dissolute mode of\r\nlife, which, thanks to the remarkable strength and elasticity of his\r\nconstitution, did not prevent his carrying on his studies and going with\r\ngreat zest into society, where he became more and more welcome, besides\r\nwriting occasionally. He translated De Quincey's _Confessions of an English\r\nOpium-Eater_, introducing some reveries of his own, but the work attracted\r\nno attention. During this period his father, naturally anxious about his\r\nson's unprofitable courses, one morning informed him that he had obtained a\r\nclerkship for him in an office connected with the military commissariat.\r\nAlfred did not venture to demur, but the confinement and routine of an\r\noffice were intolerable, and he resolved to conquer his liberty by every\r\neffort of which he was capable. He offered his manuscripts for publication\r\nto M. Canel, the devoted editor of the romantic party: they fell short by\r\nfive hundred lines of the number of pages requisite for a volume of the\r\nusual octavo bulk. He obtained a holiday, which he spent with a favorite\r\nuncle who lived in the provinces, and came back in three weeks with the\r\npoem of \"Mardoche.\" He persuaded his father to give a literary party, to\r\nwhich his friends of the Cénacle were invited, and repeated his latest\r\ncompositions to them, including \"Mardoche.\" Here we have another example of\r\nmanners startling to our notions: the keynote of these verses was rank\r\nlibertinism, yet in his mother's drawing-room and apparently in the\r\npresence of his father, a dignified, reputable man, venerated by his\r\nchildren, this young rake declaimed stanzas more licentious than any in\r\nByron's _Don Juan_. But it caused no scandal: the friends were rapturous,\r\nand predicted the infallible success of the poems, in which they were\r\njustified by the event. \"Rarely,\" says Paul de Musset, \"has so small a\r\nquantity of paper made so much noise.\" There was an uproar among the\r\nnewspapers, some applauding with all their might, others denouncing the\r\nexaggeration of the romantic tendency: the romanticists themselves were\r\ndisconcerted to find the \"Ballade à la Lune,\" which they had taken as a\r\ngood joke, turned into a joke against themselves. At all events, the young\r\nman was launched, and his vocation was thenceforth decided. In reading\r\nthese first productions of Alfred de Musset's without the prejudice or\r\npartiality of faction, it cannot be denied that if not sufficient in\r\nthemselves to ensure his immortality, they contain lines of finished beauty\r\nas perfect as the author ever produced--ample guarantee of what might be\r\nexpected from the development of his genius.\r\n\r\nHe now began to be tired of sowing wild oats, and became less irregular in\r\nhis mode of life. A lively, pretty little comedy called _Une Nuit\r\nVénitienne_, which he wrote at the request of the director of the Odéon,\r\nfor some inexplicable cause fell flat, which, besides turning him aside\r\nfrom writing for the stage during a number of years, discouraged him\r\naltogether for some time. Before he entirely recovered from the check he\r\nlost his father, who died suddenly of cholera in 1832. The shock left him\r\nsobered and calm, anxious to fulfil his duties toward his mother and young\r\nsister, whose means, it was feared, would be greatly diminished by the loss\r\nof M. de Musset's salary. Alfred resolved to publish another volume of\r\npoetry, and, if this did not succeed to a degree to warrant his considering\r\nliterature a means of support, to get a commission in the army. He set\r\nhimself industriously to work, and inspiration soon rewarded the effort: in\r\nsix months his second volume appeared, comprising \"Le Saule,\" \"Vux\r\nStériles,\" \"La Coupe et les Lèvres,\" \"A quoi rèvent les jeunes filles,\"\r\n\"Namouna,\" and several shorter pieces. Among those enumerated there are\r\nsplendid passages, second in beauty and force to but a few of his later\r\npoems, the sublime \"Nuits,\" \"Souvenir,\" and the incomparable opening of\r\n\"Rolla.\" Again he convoked the friends who three years before had greeted\r\nthe _Contes d'Espagne_ with acclamation, but, to the unutterable surprise\r\nand disappointment of both brothers, there was not a word of sympathy or\r\napplause: Mérimée alone expressed his approbation, and assured the young\r\npoet that he had made immense progress. Perhaps the others took in bad part\r\ntheir former disciple's recantation of romanticism, which he makes in the\r\ndedication of \"La Coupe et les Lèvres\" after the following formula:\r\n\r\n    For my part, I hate those snivellers in boats,\r\n      Those lovers of waterfalls, moonshine and lakes,\r\n    That breed without name, which with journals and notes,\r\n      Tears and verses, floods every step that it takes:\r\n    Nature no doubt but gives back what you lend her;\r\n    After all, it may be that they do comprehend her,\r\n    But them I do certainly not comprehend.\r\n\r\nThe chill of this introduction was not carried off by the public reception\r\nof the _Spectacle dans un Fauteuil_ (as the new collection was entitled),\r\nwhich remained almost unnoticed for some weeks, until Sainte-Beuve in the\r\n_Revue des Deux Mondes_ of January 15, 1833, published a review of this and\r\nthe earlier poems, indicating their beauty and originality, the promise of\r\nthe one and progress of the other, with his infallible discernment and\r\ndiscrimination. A few critics followed his lead, others differed, and\r\ndiscussions began again which could not but spread the young man's fame.\r\nThe _Revue des Deux Mondes_ was now open to him, and henceforth, with a few\r\nexceptions, whatever he wrote appeared in that periodical. He made his\r\nentry with the drama of _Andrea del Sarto_, which is rife with tense and\r\ntragic situations and deeply-moving scenes. The affairs of the family\r\nturned out much better than had been expected, but Alfred de Musset\r\ncontinued to work with application and ardor. His fine critical faculty\r\nkept his vagaries within bounds: he knew better than anybody \"how much good\r\nsense it requires to do without common sense\"--a dictum of his own. Like\r\nevery true artist, he took his subjects wherever he found them: the\r\ndripping raindrops and tolling of the convent-bell suggested one of\r\nChopin's most enchanting _Preludes;_ the accidental attitudes of women and\r\nchildren in the street have given painters and sculptors their finest\r\ngroups; so a bunch of fresh roses which De Musset's mother put upon his\r\ntable one morning during his days of extravagant dissipation, saying, \"All\r\nthis for fourpence,\" gave him a happy idea for unravelling the perplexity\r\nof Valentin in _Les Deux Maîtresses;_ and his unconscious exclamation, \"Si\r\nje vous le disais pourtant que je vous aime,\" which caused a passer-by in\r\nthe street to laugh at him, furnished the opening of the _Stances à Ninon_,\r\nlike Dante's\r\n\r\n    Donne ch'avete intelletto d'amore.\r\n\r\nThese fortunate dispositions were interrupted by a meeting which affected\r\nhis character and genius more than any other event in his life. It is\r\ncurious that Madame Sand and De Musset originally avoided making each\r\nother's acquaintance. She fancied that she should not like him, and he,\r\nalthough greatly struck by the genius of her first novel, _Indiana_,\r\ndisliked her overloaded style of writing, and struck out in pencil a\r\nquantity of superfluous adjectives and other parts of speech in a copy\r\nwhich unluckily fell into her hands. Their first encounter was followed by\r\na sudden, almost instantaneous, mutual passion--on his part the first and\r\nstrongest if not the only one, of his life. The first season of this\r\nintimacy was like a long summer holiday. \"It seemed,\" writes the\r\nbiographer, \"as if a partnership in which existence was so gay, to which\r\neach brought such contributions of talent, wit, grace, youth, and\r\ngood-humor, could never be dissolved. It seemed as if such happy people\r\nshould find nothing better to do than remain in a home which they had made\r\nso attractive for themselves and their friends.... I never saw such a happy\r\ncompany, nor one which cared so little about the rest of the world.\r\nConversation never flagged: they passed their time in talking, drawing, and\r\nmaking music. A childish glee reigned supreme. They invented all sorts of\r\namusements, not because they were bored, but because they were overflowing\r\nwith spirits.\" But Paris became too narrow for them, and they fled--first\r\nto Fontainebleau, then to Italy. Musset's mother was deeply opposed to the\r\nlatter project, foreseeing misfortune with the prescience of affection, and\r\nhe promised not to go without her consent, although his heart was set upon\r\nit. The most incredible story in the biography is that Madame Sand actually\r\nsurprised Madame de Musset into an interview, and, by appeals, eloquence,\r\npersuasion and vows, obtained her sorrowful acquiescence.\r\n\r\nThe lamentable story of that Italian journey has been told too often and by\r\ntoo many people to need repetition here. No doubt Paul de Musset has told\r\nit as fairly as could be expected from his brother's side: probably the\r\ncircumstances occurred much as he sets them down. But he could not make due\r\nallowance for the effect which Alfred's dissolute habits had produced upon\r\nhis character: he was but twenty-three, and had run the round of vice; he\r\nhad already depicted the moral result of such courses in his terrible\r\nallegory of \"La Coupe et les Lèvres:\" the idea recurs throughout his works,\r\nconspicuously in the _Confession d'un Enfant du Siècle_, which is Madame\r\nSand's best apology. But if his excesses had destroyed his ingenuousness,\r\nshe destroyed his faith in human nature, and on her will ever rest the\r\nbrand he set in the burning words of the \"Nuit d'Octobre.\"\r\n\r\nHe returned to Paris shattered in mind and body, and shut himself up in his\r\nroom for months, unable to endure contact with the outer world, or even\r\nthat of the loving home circle which environed him with anxious tenderness.\r\nHe could not read or write: a favorite piece of music from his young\r\nsister's piano, a game of chess with his mother in the evening, were his\r\nonly recreations--his only excitement the letters which still came from\r\nVenice, for which he looked with a sick longing, at which one cannot wonder\r\non reading them and remembering what a companionship it was that he had\r\nlost. Urged by his brother and his friend M. Buloz, the director of the\r\n_Revue des Deux Mondes_, to try the efficacy of work, he completed his play\r\nof _On ne badine pas avec l'Amour_, already sketched, in which, of all his\r\ndramatic writings, the cry of the heart is most thrilling. Aided by this\r\neffort, he made a journey to Baden in September, five months after his\r\nmiserable return to Paris. The change of air and scene restored him, and\r\nhis votive offering for the success of his pilgrimage was the charming poem\r\ncalled \"Une Bonne Fortune.\" Although he had determined not to see Madame\r\nSand again, their connection was renewed, in spite of himself, when she\r\ncame back from Italy: it lasted for a short period, full of angry and\r\nmelancholy scenes, quarrels and reconciliations. Then he broke loose for\r\never, and went back to the world and his work.\r\n\r\nThis episode, of which I have briefly given the outline, was the principal\r\nevent of Alfred de Musset's life, the one which marked and colored it most\r\ndeeply, which brought his genius to perfection by a cruel and fiery\r\ntorture, and left a lasting imprint upon his writings. Although he never\r\nproduced anything finer than certain passages of \"Rolla,\" which was\r\npublished in 1833, yet previous to that--or more accurately to 1835, when\r\nhe began to write again--he had composed no long poem of equal merit\r\nthroughout, none in which the flight was sustained from first to last. The\r\nmagnificent series of the \"Nights\" of May, December, August and October,\r\nthe \"Letter to Lamartine,\" \"Stanzas on the Death of Malibran,\" \"Hope in\r\nGod,\" and a number of others of not less melody and vigor, but less exalted\r\nand serious in tone; several plays, among them _Lorenzaccio_, which missed\r\nonly by a very little being a fine tragedy; the greater part of his prose\r\ntales and criticisms, including _Le Fils de Titien_, the most charming of\r\nhis stories, and the _Confession d'un Enfant du Siècle_, which shows as\r\nmuch genius as any of his poems,--belong to the period from 1835 to 1840,\r\nhis apogee. Of the last work, notwithstanding its unmistakable personal\r\nrevelations--which, if they do not tell the author's story, at least\r\nreflect his state of mind--Paul de Musset says, what everybody who has read\r\nhis brother's writings carefully will feel to be true, that neither in the\r\nhero nor any other single personage must we look for Alfred's entire\r\nindividuality. In the complexity of his character and emotions, and the\r\ncontradictions which they united, are to be found the eidolon of every\r\nyoung man in his collection, even \"the two heroes of _Les Caprices de\r\nMarianne_, Octave and Clio,\" says Paul, \"although they are the antipodes\r\nof one another.\" Neither is it as easy as it would seem on the surface to\r\ntrace the thread of any one incident of his life through his writings.\r\nAlthough containing some irreconcilable passages, the four \"Nights\"\r\nappeared to have been born of the same impulse and to exact the same\r\ndedication: it is undeniably a shock to have their inconsistencies\r\nexplained by hearing that while the \"Nuits de Mai,\" \"d'Août\" and\r\n\"d'Octobre\" refer to his passion for Madame Sand, the \"Nuit de Décembre\"\r\nand \"Lettre à Lamartine,\" which naturally belong to this series, were\r\ndictated by another attachment and another disappointment. I will not stop\r\nto moralize upon this: the story of De Musset's life is really only the\r\nstory of his loves. His brother says that he was always in love with\r\nsomebody: it was a necessity of his nature and his genius. Before he was\r\ntwenty-seven, six different love-affairs are enumerated, without taking\r\ninto account numerous affairs of gallantry; nor was the sixth the last. The\r\n\"Nuit d'Octobre\" was written two years and a half after his return from\r\nItaly, and its terrible malediction is the outbreak of the rankling memory\r\nof his wrong and suffering. It was psychologically in order that while his\r\nlove (which does not die in an hour, like trust and respect) survived, it\r\nshould surround its object with lingering tenderness, but that as it slowly\r\nexpired indignation, scorn and the sense of injury should increase: this is\r\ntheir final utterance, followed by pardon, a vow of forgetfulness and\r\nfarewell, but not a final farewell. That was spoken years afterward, in\r\n1841, when, once again seeing by chance the forest of Fontainebleau, and\r\nabout the same time casually encountering Madame Sand, he poured forth his\r\n\"Souvenir,\" a poem of matchless sweetness and beauty, vibrating with\r\nfeeling and most musical in expression--an exquisite combination of lyric\r\nand elegy. In this he calls her\r\n\r\n    Ma seule amie à jamais la plus chère.\r\n\r\nTen years after this, in one of the last strains of his unstrung harp, a\r\nfragment called \"Souvenir des Alpes,\" the sad chord is touched once more:\r\nup to the end it answered faintly to certain notes. Long after their\r\nrupture and separation he said that he would have given ten years of his\r\nlife to marry her had she been free; and it is deplorable that the most\r\nfervent and lasting affection of which he was capable should have been\r\nthrown back upon him in such sort.\r\n\r\nOf marriage there were several schemes at different times: they fell\r\nthrough because he was averse to them himself, except one to which he much\r\ninclined, the young lady being pretty, intelligent, charming and the\r\ndaughter of an old friend; but on the first advances it turned out that she\r\nwas engaged to another man. His biographer regrets this deeply, convinced\r\nthat such an alliance would have been his brother's salvation; but even if\r\nhe could have been more constant to his wife than to his mistresses, the\r\nhabit of intemperance was too confirmed to admit much hope of domestic\r\nhappiness. The same may be opined in regard to the vague hopes which were\r\ndestroyed by the death of the young duke of Orleans. When Louis Philippe\r\ncame to the throne, De Musset made no attempt to approach the royal family\r\non the pretext of the old school-friendship: it was the duke himself who\r\nrenewed it in 1836 on accidentally seeing some unpublished verses of the\r\npoet's on the king's escape from an attempt at assassination. Louis\r\nPhilippe himself did not like the sonnet, considering the use of the poetic\r\n_thou_ too familiar a form of address: he did not know who was the author;\r\nand when Alfred was presented to him at a court-ball took him for a cousin\r\nwho was inspector of the royal forests at Joinville, and continued to greet\r\nhim, under this mistake, with a few gracious words two or three times a\r\nyear during the rest of his reign, while the poet's name was on the lips\r\nand in the heart of every one else. The duke's favor and friendliness ended\r\nonly with his sad and sudden death.\r\n\r\nPaul de Musset tells us that the years 1837 and 1838 were the happiest in\r\nhis brother's life. The love-trouble which had wrung from him the \"Nuit de\r\nDécembre\" was a disappointment, but not a deception, and the parting had\r\ncaused equal sorrow on both sides, but no bitterness. After no long\r\ninterval appeared \"a very young and very pretty person whom he met\r\nfrequently in society, of an enthusiastic, passionate nature, independent\r\nin her position, and who bought the poet's books.\" An acquaintance, a\r\nfriendship, a correspondence, a serious passion followed, and became a\r\nrelation which lasted two years \"without quarrel, storm, coolness or\r\nsubject of umbrage or jealousy--two years of love without a cloud, of true\r\nhappiness.\" Why did it not last for ever? The biographer does not give the\r\nanswer. It is hinted in a letter to Alfred's friend, the duchesse de\r\nCastries, dated September, 1840, in his _uvres posthumes_: \"I have told\r\nyou how about a year ago an absurd passion, totally useless and somewhat\r\nridiculous, made me break with all my habits. I forsook all my\r\nsurroundings, my friends of both sexes, the current in which I was living,\r\nand one of the prettiest women in Paris. I did not succeed in my foolish\r\ndream, you must understand; and now I find myself cured, it is true, but\r\nhigh and dry like a fish in a grain-field.\" This is probably the clue, and\r\nthe foolish dream was for a woman to whom his brother refers as having\r\nrepelled Alfred's homage with harshness, and having called forth from him\r\nsome short and extremely bitter verses beginning \"Oui, femme,\" and another\r\ncalled \"Adieu!\" in which there prevails a tone of quiet but deep feeling.\r\nThis is a sad story: he apparently united the volatility and vagrancy of\r\nfancy, the inconstancy of light shallow natures, with the ardor and\r\nintensity of passion and the capacity for suffering which belong to strong\r\nand steadfast ones. There was a childlike quality in his disposition, which\r\nshowed itself in a sort of simplicity and spontaneousness in the midst of a\r\ncorrupt existence, and still more in the uncontrollable, absorbing violence\r\nof his emotions: they swept over him, momentarily devastating his present\r\nand blotting out the horizon, but unlike the tempests of childhood their\r\nravages did not disappear when the clouds dispersed and the torrents\r\nsubsided. The life of debauchery which had preceded his journey to Italy\r\nwas replaced, for some years, by a less excessive degree of dissipation,\r\nduring which he lived with a fast set, who, however, were men of talent and\r\naccomplishments, the foremost among them being Prince Belgiojoso. The\r\ninfluence of the two fortunate years, 1837-38, not only the happiest but\r\nthe most fertile of his short career, seems to have weakened these\r\nassociations and led him into calmer paths. He had formed several\r\nfriendships with women of a sort which both parties may regard with pride,\r\nin particular with the Princess Belgiojoso, one of the most striking and\r\noriginal figures of our monotonous time, and Madame Maxime Jaubert, a\r\nclever, attractive young woman with a delightful house, whom he called his\r\n_Marraine_ because she had given him a nickname. These women, and\r\nothers--but these two above the rest--were sincerely and loyally attached\r\nto him with a disinterested regard which did not spare advice, nor even\r\nrebuke, or relax under his loss of health and brilliancy or neglect of\r\ntheir kindness, which nevertheless he felt and valued. His purest source of\r\npleasure was in the talent of others, which gave him a generous and\r\nsympathetic enjoyment. The appearance of Pauline Garcia--now Madame\r\nViardot--and Rachel, who came out almost simultaneously at the age of\r\nseventeen, added delight to the two happy years. He has left notices of the\r\nfirst performances of these artistes, the former in opera, the latter on\r\nthe stage (for he was musical himself and a _connoisseur_) which are\r\nexcellent criticisms, and have even more interest than when they appeared,\r\nnow that the career of one has long been closed and that of the other long\r\ncompleted. His relations with Rachel lasted for many years, interrupted by\r\nthe gusts and blasts which the contact of two such natures inevitably\r\nbegets. She constantly urged him to write a play for her, and in the year\r\nafter her _début_ he wrote a fragment of a drama on the story of\r\nFrédegonde, which she learned by heart and occasionally recited in private;\r\nbut there were endless delays and difficulties on both sides, and the rest\r\nwas not written. After various episodes and passages between them, De\r\nMusset was dining with her one evening when she had become a great lady and\r\nqueen of the theatre, and her other guests were all rich men of fashion.\r\nOne of them admired an extremely beautiful and costly ring which she wore.\r\nIt was first passed round the table from hand to hand, and then she said\r\nthey might bid for it. One immediately offered five hundred francs, another\r\nfifteen, and the ring went up at once to three thousand: \"And you, my poet,\r\nwhy do not you bid? What will you give?\" \"I will give you my heart,\" he\r\nreplied. \"The ring is yours,\" cried Rachel, taking it off and throwing it\r\ninto his plate. After dinner De Musset tried to restore it to her, but she\r\nrefused to take it back: he urged and insisted, when she, suddenly falling\r\non her knee with that sovereign charm of seduction for which she was as\r\nrenowned as for her tragic power, entreated him to keep it as a pledge for\r\nthe piece he was to write for her. The poet took the ring, and went home\r\nexcited and wrought up to the resolve that nothing should interfere with\r\nthe completion of his task. But it was the old story again--whims and\r\npostponements on Rachel's part, possibly temper and pique on his--until six\r\nmonths afterward, at the end of an angry conversation, he silently replaced\r\nthe ring on her hand, and she did not resist. Four years later the compact\r\nwas renewed, and although by this time De Musset had to all intents and\r\npurposes ceased to write, he struck off the first act of a play called\r\n_Faustina_, the scene of which was laid in Venice in the fourteenth\r\ncentury; but he put off finishing it, and finally let it drop altogether.\r\n\r\nIn December, 1840, Alfred de Musset was thirty years old, and on his\r\nbirthday he had one of those reckonings with himself, which the most\r\ndeliberately careless and volatile men cannot escape. At twenty-one he had\r\nheld a similar settlement: he was then uncertain of his genius,\r\ndissatisfied with his way of life and with the use he made of his time: the\r\nresult was his adoption of a more serious line of study and conduct, which\r\nhad led him, in spite of interruptions and aberrations, to the brilliant\r\ndisplay of his beautiful and splendid talents, the full exercise of his\r\nwonderful powers. Now another review of his past and survey of his future\r\nleft him in a mood of discontent and depression. He felt that he could not\r\nalways go on being a boy. The year behind him had been almost sterile, and\r\nmarked by the loss of many of what he called his illusions. He had been\r\nimplored and urged to write by his friends and editors, had made and broken\r\npromises without number to the latter, and had become involved in money\r\ndifficulties to a degree which kept him in constant anxiety and torment.\r\nYet he steadily rejected all his brother's affectionate advice and\r\nimportunities to shake off the deepening lethargy. He would not write\r\npoetry because the Muse did not come of her free will, and he would never\r\ndo her violence. He had forsworn prose, because he said everybody wrote\r\nthat, and many so ill that he would not swell the number of magazine\r\nstory-writers, who, he foresaw, were to lower the standard of fiction and\r\nstyle. In short, he always had an excuse for doing nothing, and although he\r\nhated above all things to leave Paris, and seldom accepted the invitations\r\nof his friends in the country, he now repeatedly rushed out of town to\r\nescape the visits of editors, who had become no better than duns in his\r\neyes. When at home he shut himself in his room for days together in so\r\ngloomy a frame of mind that even his brother did not venture to break in\r\nupon him: he even made a furtive attempt at suicide one night when his\r\ndespondency reached its lowest depth; it was foiled by the accident of\r\nPaul's having unloaded the pistols and locked up the powder and balls some\r\ntime before. He grew morbidly irritable, and resented Paul's remonstrances,\r\nwhich, we may be sure, were made with all the tact and consideration of\r\nnatural delicacy and unselfish affection, generally by laughing at the poor\r\npoet, which was the most effectual way of restoring his courage and\r\ngood-humor. One morning he emerged from his seclusion, and with vindictive\r\ndesperation threw before his brother a quantity of manuscripts, saying,\r\n\"You _would_ have prose: there it is for you.\" It was the introduction to a\r\nsort of romance called _Le Poète déchu_, a wretched story of a young man of\r\nmany gifts who finds himself under the necessity of writing for the support\r\nof his orphan sisters, and it described with harrowing eloquence the vain\r\nefforts of his exhausted brain. The extracts in the biography are painfully\r\naffecting and powerful, but the work was never finished or published. Such\r\na state of things could not go on indefinitely, and De Musset fell\r\ndangerously ill of congestion of the lungs, brought on by reckless\r\nimprudence when already far from well: the attack was accompanied by so\r\nmuch fever and delirium that it was at first mistaken for brain fever. This\r\nillness redoubled the tenderness and devotion of his family and friends:\r\nhis Marraine and Princess Belgiojoso took turns by his bedside, magnetizing\r\nthe unruly patient into quiescence; but the person who exercised the\r\ngreatest influence over him was a poor Sister of Charity, Sur Marcelline,\r\nwho was engaged to assist in nursing him. The untiring care,\r\nself-abnegation, angelic sweetness and serenity of this humble woman gained\r\nthe attachment of the whole family, and established an ascendency over\r\nAlfred's impressionable imagination. She did not confine her office to her\r\npatient's physical welfare, but strove earnestly to minister to him\r\nspiritually. His long convalescence \"was like a second birth. He did not\r\nseem more than seventeen: he had the joyousness of a child, the fancies of\r\na page, like Cherubino in the _Marriage of Figaro_. All the difficulties\r\nand subjects of despair which preceded his malady had vanished in a\r\nrose-colored distance. He passed his days in reading interminable\r\nbooks--_Clarissa Harlowe_, which he already knew, the _Memorial of St.\r\nHelena_, and all the memoirs relating to the Empire. In the evening we all\r\ngathered about his writing-table to draw and chat, while Sur Marcelline\r\nsat by knitting in bright worsteds. Auguste Barre, our neighbor, came to\r\nwork at an album of caricatures in the style of Töppfer's, and we all\r\namused ourselves with the comic illustrations: Alfred and Barre had the\r\npencil, the rest of us composed a text as absurd as the drawings. Who will\r\ngive us back those delicious evenings of laughter, jest and chat, when\r\nwithout stirring from home or depending on anything from without our whole\r\nhousehold was so happy?\" Alas! they were not of long duration. By and by\r\nSister Marcelline went away, leaving her patient a pen on which she had\r\nembroidered, \"Remember your promises.\" He was afflicted by her departure,\r\nand wrote some lines to her, who, as he said, did not know what poetry\r\nmeant, but he could never be induced to show them, although he repeated\r\nthem to Paul and their friend Alfred Tattet, who between them contrived to\r\nnote down the four following verses:\r\n\r\n    Poor girl! thou art no longer fair.\r\n    By watching Death with patient care\r\n      Thou pale as he art grown:\r\n    By tending upon human pain\r\n    Thy hand is worn as coarse in grain\r\n      As horny Labor's own.\r\n\r\n    But weariness and courage meek\r\n    Illuminate thy pallid cheek\r\n      Beside the dying bed:\r\n    To the poor suffering mortal's clutch\r\n    Thy hard hand hath a gentle touch,\r\n      With tears and warm blood fed.\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Tread to the end thy lonely road,\r\n    All for thy task and toward thy God,\r\n      Thy footsteps day by day.\r\n    That evil must exist, we prate,\r\n    And wisely leave it to its fate,\r\n      And pass another way;\r\n\r\n    But thy pure conscience owns it not,\r\n    Though ceaseless warfare is thy lot\r\n    Against disease and woe;\r\n    No ills for thee have power to sting,\r\n    Nor to thy lip a murmur bring,\r\n      Save those that others know.\r\n\r\nDe Musset held in peculiar sacredness and reverence whatever was connected\r\nwith this good woman and his feeling for her: seventeen years after this\r\nillness the embroidered pen and a piece of her knitting were buried with\r\nhim by almost his last request.\r\n\r\nSeventeen years! a large bit of any one's life--more than a third of Alfred\r\nde Musset's own term--yet there is hardly anything to say about it. The\r\n\"Souvenir,\" which was written about six months after his recovery, is the\r\nlast poem in which all his strength, beauty and pathos find expression: he\r\nnever wrote again in this vein: it was the last echo of his youth. He\r\ncomposed less and less frequently, and though what he wrote was redolent of\r\nsentiment, wit, grace and elegance, and some of the short occasional verses\r\nhave a consummate charm of finish, the soul seems gone out of his poetry.\r\nHis brother mentions a number of compositions begun, but thrown aside;\r\nthere were projects of travel never carried out; he gradually gave up the\r\nsociety of even his oldest friends: everything indicated a rapid decline of\r\nthe active faculties. Unhappily, that of suffering seemed only to\r\nincrease--no longer the sharp anguish of unspent force which had wrung from\r\nhim the passionate cries and plaintive murmurs of former years, but the\r\ndull numbness of hopelessness. His existence was monotonous, and the few\r\noccurrences which varied it were of a sad or unpleasant nature. His sister\r\nmarried and left Paris, and his mother subsequently went to live with her\r\nin the country, thus breaking up their family circle; Paul de Musset was\r\nabsent from France for considerable spaces of time, so that for the first\r\ntime Alfred de Musset was compelled to live alone. Friends scattered, some\r\ndied: the Orleans family, for whom he had a real affection, was driven from\r\nFrance; he fancied that his genius was unappreciated--a notion which,\r\nstrangely enough, his brother shared--and although he was the last man to\r\nrage or mope over misapprehension, the idea certainly added to his gloom.\r\nThrough the good graces of the duke of Orleans he had been appointed\r\nlibrarian of the Home Office, a post of which he was instantly deprived on\r\nthe change of government; but a few years later he was unexpectedly given a\r\nsimilar one in the Department of Public Education. In 1852 he was elected\r\nto the French Academy, that honor so limited by the small number of\r\nmembers, so ridiculed by unsuccessful aspirants, yet without which no\r\nFrench author feels his career to be complete. His plays were being\r\nperformed with great favor, his poems and tales were becoming more and more\r\npopular, his verses were set to music, his stories were illustrated: but\r\nall this brought no cheer or consolation to the sick spirit. He lived more\r\nand more alone: the Théâtre Français, a silent game of chess at his café,\r\nthe deadly absinthe, were his only sources of excitement. It is a comfort\r\nto learn that the last ray of pleasure which penetrated his moral dungeon,\r\nreviving for an instant the generous glow of enthusiasm, was the appearance\r\nof Ristori: inspired by her, he began a poetical address which he never\r\nfinished, nor even wrote down, but a fragment of it was preserved orally by\r\none or two who heard it:\r\n\r\n    For Pauline and Rachel I sang of hope,\r\n      And over Malibran a tear I shed;\r\n    But, thanks to thee, I see the mighty scope\r\n            Of strength and genius wed.\r\n\r\n    Ah keep them long! The heart which breathes the prayer\r\n      When genius calls has ever made reply,\r\n    Bear smiling home to Italy the fair,\r\n            A flower from our sky.\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    They tell me that in spite of grief and wrong,\r\n      And pride bent earthward by a tyrant's heel,\r\n    A noble race, though crushed and conquered long,\r\n            Has not yet learned to kneel.\r\n\r\n    Rome's godlike dwellers of a bygone age,\r\n      The marble, porphyry, alabaster forms,\r\n    Still live: at night, to speech upon the stage,\r\n            An ancient statue warms.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhat was the cause of De Musset's unhappiness and impotence? His brother\r\ntries to account for them by an enumeration of the distresses and\r\nannoyances mentioned above, and others of the same order; but when one\r\nremembers how the poet's great sorrows, his father's death and the betrayal\r\nof his affection by the first woman he really loved, had given him his\r\nfinest conceptions in verse and prose, it is impossible to accept so\r\ninsufficient an explanation. Nor can we allow that De Musset sank into a\r\ncondition of puerile impatience and senile querulousness. Judged by our\r\nstandard, all the Latin races lack manhood, as we may possibly do by\r\ntheirs: De Musset was only as much more sensitive than the rest of his\r\ncountrymen as those of the poetic temperament are usually found to be in\r\nall countries. Nor had he seen his talent slowly expire: the spring did not\r\nrun dry by degrees: it suddenly sank into the ground. He had made a fearful\r\nmistake at the outset, which he discovered too late if at all. Considering\r\nwhat life is sure to bring to every one in the way of trial and sorrow, it\r\nis not worth while to go in search of emotions and experience which are\r\ncertain to find us out; nor is it in the slums of life that its meaning is\r\nto be sought. He had foretold his own end in the prophetic warning of his\r\nMuse:\r\n\r\n    Quand les dieux irrités m'ôteront ton génie,\r\n    Si je tombe des cieux que me répondras-tu?\r\n\r\nHis light was not lost in a storm-cloud nor eclipse, but in the awful\r\nRadnorok, the Götterdämmerung, when sun and stars fall from a blank heaven.\r\nHis health and habits constantly grew worse--he had organic disease of the\r\nheart--but his existence dragged on until May 1st, 1857, when an acute\r\nattack carried him off after a few days' illness. He died in his brother's\r\narms, and his last words were, \"Sleep! at last I shall sleep.\" He had\r\nkilled himself physically and intellectually as surely as the wages of sin\r\nare death.\r\n\r\nBut let not this be the last word on one so beloved as a poet and a man.\r\nMental qualities alone never endear their possessor to every being that\r\ncomes into contact with him, and Alfred de Musset was idolized by people\r\nwho could not even read. There was not a generous or amiable quality in\r\nwhich he was wanting: he had an inextinguishable ardor for genius and\r\ngreatness in every form; he was tender-hearted to excess, could not endure\r\nthe sight of suffering, and delighted in giving pleasure; his sympathy was\r\nready and entire, his loyalty of the truest metal. \"He never abused\r\nanybody,\" says his brother, \"nor sacrificed an absent person for the sake\r\nof a good story.\" He loved animals and children, and they loved him in\r\nreturn.\r\n\r\nHe can never cease to be the poet of the many, for he has melody,\r\nsentiment, passion, all that charms the popular ear and heart--a\r\npersonality which is the expression of human nature in a language which, as\r\nhe himself says, few speak, but all understand. He can never cease to be\r\nthe poet of the few, because, while his poems are a very concentration and\r\nelixir of the most intense and profound feelings of which we are all\r\ncapable, they give words to the more exquisite and intimate emotions\r\npeculiar to those of a keener and more refined susceptibility, of a more\r\nexalted and aërial range. Sainte-Beuve says somewhere, though not in his\r\nfinal verdict on De Musset, that his chief merit is having restored to\r\nFrench literature the wit which had been driven out of it by the\r\nsentimentalists. His wit is indeed delightful and irresistible, but it is\r\nnot his magic key to souls. In other countries every generation has its own\r\npoet: younger ears are deaf to the music which so long charmed ours; but De\r\nMusset will be the poet of each new generation for a certain season--the\r\nsweetest of all, because, as has been well said, he is the poet of youth.\r\nAnd if doubt breathes through some of his grandest strophes, Faith finds\r\nher first and last profession in the lines--\r\n\r\n    Une immense espérance a traversé la terre;\r\n    Malgré nous vers le ciel il faut lever les yeux.\r\n\r\nSARAH B. WISTER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BEE.\r\n\r\n\r\n    What time I paced, at pleasant morn,\r\n      A deep and dewy wood,\r\n    I heard a mellow hunting-horn\r\n      Make dim report of Dian's lustihood\r\n    Far down a heavenly hollow.\r\n    Mine ear, though fain, had pain to follow:\r\n      _Tara!_ it twang'd, _tara-tara!_ it blew,\r\n      Yet wavered oft, and flew\r\n    Most ficklewise about, or here, or there,\r\n    A music now from earth and now from air.\r\n      But on a sudden, lo!\r\n      I marked a blossom shiver to and fro\r\n    With dainty inward storm; and there within\r\n    A down-drawn trump of yellow jessamine\r\n              A bee\r\n      Thrust up its sad-gold body lustily,\r\n    All in a honey madness hotly bound\r\n              On blissful burglary.\r\n                       A cunning sound\r\n    In that wing-music held me: down I lay\r\n    In amber shades of many a golden spray,\r\n    Where looping low with languid arms the Vine\r\n    In wreaths of ravishment did overtwine\r\n    Her kneeling Live-Oak, thousand-fold to plight\r\n    Herself unto her own true stalwart knight.\r\n\r\n    As some dim blur of distant music nears\r\n    The long-desiring sense, and slowly clears\r\n      To forms of time and apprehensive tune,\r\n      So, as I lay, full soon\r\n    Interpretation throve: the bee's fanfare,\r\n    Through sequent films of discourse vague as air,\r\n    Passed to plain words, while, fanning faint perfume,\r\n    The bee o'erhung a rich unrifled bloom:\r\n      \"O Earth, fair lordly Blossom, soft a-shine\r\n      Upon the star-pranked universal vine,\r\n              Hast naught for me?\r\n                       To thee\r\n      Come I, a poet, hereward haply blown,\r\n      From out another worldflower lately flown.\r\n    Wilt ask, _What profit e'er a poet brings?_\r\n    He beareth starry stuff about his wings\r\n    To pollen thee and sting thee fertile: nay,\r\n    If still thou narrow thy contracted way,\r\n      --Worldflower, if thou refuse me--\r\n      --Worldflower, if thou abuse me,\r\n      And hoist thy stamen's spear-point high\r\n      To wound my wing and mar mine eye--\r\n    Natheless I'll drive me to thy deepest sweet,\r\n    Yea, richlier shall that pain the pollen beat\r\n    From me to thee, for oft these pollens be\r\n    Fine dust from wars that poets wage for thee.\r\n    But, O beloved Earthbloom soft a-shine\r\n    Upon the universal jessamine,\r\n          Prithee abuse me not,\r\n          Prithee refuse me not;\r\n    Yield, yield the heartsome honey love to me\r\n          Hid in thy nectary!\"\r\n    And as I sank into a suaver dream\r\n    The pleading bee-song's burthen sole did seem,\r\n    \"Hast ne'er a honey-drop of love for me\r\n          In thy huge nectary?\"\r\n\r\nSIDNEY LANIER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"OUR JOOK.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Königin,\" said I, as I poked the fire, \"what do you think of the people in\r\nthe house?\"\r\n\r\nOn second thoughts it was not \"Königin\" that I said, for it was only that\r\nnight that she received the title. It is of no consequence what I did call\r\nher, however, for from that time she was never anything but Königin to me.\r\n\r\nWe began to \"talk things over,\" as we had a way of doing; and very good fun\r\nit was and quite harmless, provided the ventilator was not open. That had\r\nhappened once or twice, and got us into quite serious scrapes. People have\r\nsuch an utterly irrational objection to your amusing yourself in the most\r\ninnocent way at what they consider their expense.\r\n\r\nKönigin and I had come to the boarding-house that very day. We were by\r\nourselves, for our male protectors were off \"a-hunting the wild deer and\r\nfollowing the roe\"--or its Florida equivalent, whatever that may be--and we\r\ndid not fancy staying at a hotel under the circumstances. Now, we had taken\r\nour observations, and were prepared to pronounce our opinions on our\r\nfellow-boarders. One after another was canvassed and dismissed. Mr. A. had\r\neccentric table-manners; Miss B. wriggled and squirmed when she talked;\r\nMrs. C. was much too lavish of inappropriate epithets; Mr. X.'s\r\nconversation, on the contrary, was quite bald and bare from the utter lack\r\nof those parts of speech; Miss Y. had a nice face, and Mrs. Z. a pretty\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nJust here Königin suddenly burst out laughing. \"Really,\" she said, \"we go\r\nabout the world criticising people as if we were King Solomon and the queen\r\nof Sheba.\"\r\n\r\n\"'Die Königin von Seba,'\" said I. \"That, I suppose, is you and our motto\r\nshould be, 'Wir sind das Volk und die Weisheit stirbt mit uns.'\"\r\n\r\nI was not at all sure of the accuracy of my translation, but its\r\nappropriateness was unquestionable.\r\n\r\n\"What do you think of the Englishman, Königin?\" I asked, giving the fire\r\nanother poke, not from shamefacedness, but because it really needed it, for\r\nthe evening was damp and chilly.\r\n\r\n\"I like him,\" said Königin decidedly.\r\n\r\nKönigin and I were always prepared with decided opinions, whether we knew\r\nanything about the subject in hand or not.\r\n\r\n\"He has a fine head,\" Königin went on, \"quite a ducal contour, according to\r\nour republican ideas of what a duke ought to be. I like the steady intense\r\nlight of his eyes under those straight dark brows, and that little frown\r\nonly increases the effect. Then his laugh is so frank and boyish. Yes, I\r\nlike him very much.\"\r\n\r\n\"He has a nice gentlemanly voice,\" I suggested--\"rather on the\r\n'gobble-gobble' order, but that is the fault of his English birth.\"\r\n\r\nThis is enough of that conversation, for, after all, neither of us is the\r\nheroine of this tale. It is well that this should be distinctly understood\r\nat the start. Somehow, \"the Jook\" (as we generally called him, in memory of\r\nJeames Yellowplush) and I became very intimate after that, but it was never\r\nanything more than a sort of _camaraderie_. Königin knew all about it, and\r\nshe pronounced it the most remarkable instance of a purely intellectual\r\nflirtation which she had ever seen; which was all quite correct, except for\r\nthe term \"flirtation,\" of which it never had a spice.\r\n\r\nOne of the Jook's most striking peculiarities, though by no means an\r\nuncommon one among his countrymen, was a profound distrust of new\r\nacquaintances and an utter incapacity of falling into the free and easy\r\nways which prevail more strongly perhaps in Florida than in any other part\r\nof America. There really was some excuse for him, though, for, not to put\r\nit too strongly, society is a little mixed in Florida, and it is hard for a\r\nforeigner to discriminate closely enough to avoid being drawn into\r\nunpleasant complications if he relaxes in the slightest degree his rules of\r\nreserve. Besides which, the Jook was a man of the most morbid and ultra\r\nrefinement. \"Refinement\" was the word he preferred, but I should have\r\ncalled it an absurd squeamishness. He could make no allowance for personal\r\nor local peculiarities, and eccentricities in our neighbors which delighted\r\nKönigin and me and sent us into fits of laughter excited in his mind only\r\nthe most profound disgust. Therefore, partly in the fear of having his\r\nsensibilities unpleasantly jarred upon, partly from the fear of making\r\nobjectionable acquaintances whom he might afterward be unable to shake\r\noff, and partly from an inherent and ineradicable shyness, he went about\r\nclad in a mantle of gloomy reserve, speaking to no one, looking at no\r\none--\"grand, gloomy and peculiar.\" It was currently reported that previous\r\nto our arrival he had never spoken to a creature in the boarding-house,\r\nthough he had been an inmate of it for six weeks. For the rest, he was\r\nclever and intelligent, with frank, honest, boyish ways, which I liked,\r\neven though they were sometimes rather exasperating.\r\n\r\nIt was not quite pleasant, for instance, to hear him speak of Americans in\r\nthe frank and unconstrained manner which he adopted when talking to us. We\r\ncould hardly wonder at it when we looked at the promiscuous crowd which\r\nformed his idea of American society. Refined and well-bred people there\r\ncertainly were, but these were precisely the ones who never forced\r\nthemselves upon his notice, leaving him to be struck and stunned by fast\r\nand hoydenish young ladies, ungrammatical and ill-bred old ones, and men of\r\nall shades of boorishness and swagger, such as make themselves conspicuous\r\nin every crowd. Unluckily, both Königin and I have English blood in our\r\nveins, and the Jook could not be convinced that we did not eagerly snatch\r\nat the chance thus presented of claiming the title of British subjects. It\r\nis quite hopeless to attempt to convince Englishmen that any American would\r\nnot be British if he could. Pride in American citizenship is an idea\r\nutterly monstrous and inconceivable to them, and they can look on the\r\nprofession of it in no other light than that of a laudable attempt at\r\nmaking the best of a bad case. Therefore, the Jook persisted in ignoring\r\nour protestations of patriotic ardor, and in paying us the delicate\r\ncompliment of considering us English and expressing his views on America\r\nwith a beautiful frankness which kept us in a frame of mind verging on\r\ndelirium.\r\n\r\nWhat was to be done with such a man? Clearly, but one thing, and I sighed\r\nfor one of our American belles who should come and see and conquer this\r\nimpracticable Englishman. At present, things seemed quite hopeless. There\r\nwas no one within reach who would have the slightest chance of success in\r\nsuch an undertaking. Though outsiders gave me the credit of his\r\nsubjugation, I knew quite well that there not only was not, but never could\r\nbe, the necessary tinge of sentimentality in our intercourse. We were much\r\ntoo free and easy for that, and we laughed and talked, rambled and boated\r\ntogether, \"like two babes in the woods,\" as Königin was fond of remarking.\r\n\r\nIt was in Florida that all this took place--in shabby, fascinating\r\nJacksonville, where one meets everybody and does nothing in particular\r\nexcept lounge about and be happy. So the Jook and I lounged and were happy\r\nwith a placid, unexciting sort of happiness, until the day when Kitty Grey\r\ndescended upon us with the suddenness of a meteor, and very like one in her\r\nbewildering brightness.\r\n\r\nKitty was by no means pretty, but, though women recognized this fact, the\r\nman who could be convinced of it remains yet to be discovered. You might\r\nforce them to confess that Kitty's nose was flat, her eyes not well shaped,\r\nher teeth crooked, her mouth slightly awry, but it always came back to the\r\nsame point: \"Curious that with all these defects she should still be so\r\nexquisitely pretty!\"\r\n\r\nReally, I did not so much wonder at it myself sometimes when I saw Kitty's\r\npale cheeks flush with that delicious pink, her wide hazel eyes deepen and\r\nglow, her little face light up with elfish mirth, and her round, childish\r\nfigure poise itself in some coquettish attitude. Then she had such absurd\r\nlittle hands, with short fingers and babyish dimples, such tiny feet, and\r\nsuch a wealth of crinkled dark-brown hair--such bewitching little helpless\r\nways, too, a fashion of throwing herself appealingly on your compassion\r\nwhich no man on earth could resist! At bottom she was a self-reliant,\r\nindependent little soul, but no mortal man ever found that out: Kitty was\r\nfar too wise.\r\n\r\nOf course, as soon as I saw Kitty I thought of the Jook. Would he or\r\nwouldn't he? On the whole, I was rather afraid he wouldn't, for Kitty's\r\nlaugh sometimes rang out a little too loud, and Kitty's spirits sometimes\r\ngot the better of her and set her frisking like a kitten, and I was afraid\r\nthe modest sense of propriety which was one of the Jook's strong points\r\nwould not survive it. However, I concluded to risk it, but just here a\r\nsudden and unforeseen obstacle checked my triumphant course.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Warriner,\" I said sweetly (I was always horribly afraid I should call\r\nhim Mr. Jook, but I never did), \"I want to introduce you to my friend, Miss\r\nGrey.\"\r\n\r\nThe Jook looked at me with his most placid smile, and replied blandly,\r\n\"Thank you very much, but _I'd rather not_.\"\r\n\r\nDid any one ever hear of such a man? I understood his reasons well enough,\r\nthough he did not take the trouble to explain them: it was only\r\nexclusiveness gone mad. And he prided himself upon his race and breeding,\r\nand considered our American men boors!\r\n\r\nAfter that I nearly gave up his case as hopeless, and devoted myself to\r\nKitty, whom I really believe the Jook did not know by sight after having\r\nbeen for nearly a week in the same house with her.\r\n\r\nKitty once or twice mildly insinuated her desire to know him. \"He has such\r\na nice face,\" she said plaintively, \"and such lovely little curly brown\r\nwhiskers! He is the only man in the house worth looking at, but if I happen\r\nto come up when he is talking to you, he instantly disappears. He must\r\nthink me _very_ ugly.\"\r\n\r\nIt was really very embarrassing to me, for of course I could not tell her\r\nthat the Jook had declined the honor of an introduction. I knew, as well as\r\nif she had told me so, that Kitty in her secret heart accused me of a mean\r\nand selfish desire to keep him all to myself, but I was obliged meekly to\r\nendure the obloquy, undeserved as it was. Königin used to go into fits of\r\nlaughter at my dilemma, and just at this period my admiration of the Jook\r\nwent down to the lowest ebb. \"He is a selfish, conceited creature!\" I\r\nexclaimed in my wrath. \"I really believe he thinks that bewitching little\r\nKitty would fall in love with him forthwith if he submitted to an\r\nintroduction. Oh, I _do_ wish he knew what we thought of him! _Why_ doesn't\r\nhe listen outside of ventilators?\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear,\" said Königin, still laughing, though sympathetic, \"it strikes me\r\nthat we began by making rather a demi-god of the man, and are ending by\r\nstripping him of even the good qualities which he probably does possess.\"\r\n\r\nWell! things went on in this exasperating way for a week or so longer. Of\r\ncourse I washed my hands of the Jook, for I was too much exasperated to be\r\neven civil to him. Kitty was as bright and good-natured as ever, ready to\r\nenjoy all the little pleasures that came in her way, though now and then I\r\nfancied that I detected a stealthy, wistful look at the Jook's impassive\r\nface.\r\n\r\nIt was lovely that day, but fearfully hot. The sun showered down its\r\nburning rays upon the white Florida sands, the sky was one arch of\r\ncloudless blue, and the water-oaks swung their moss-wreaths languidly over\r\nthe deserted streets. We had been dreaming and drowsing away the morning,\r\nKönigin, Kitty and I, in the jelly-fish-like state into which one naturally\r\nfalls in Florida.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Kitty sprang to her feet. \"I can't stand this any longer,\" she\r\nsaid: \"I shall turn into an oyster if I vegetate here. Please, do you see\r\nany shells sprouting on my back yet?\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you want to do?\" I asked drowsily. \"You can't walk in this heat,\r\nand if you go on the river the sun will take the skin off your face, and\r\nwhere are you then, Miss Kitty?\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't help that,\" retorted Kitty in a tone of desperation. \"I don't\r\nexactly know where I shall go, but I think in pursuit of some yellow\r\njessamine.\"\r\n\r\nI sat straight up and gazed at her: \"Are you mad, Kitty? Has the heat\r\naddled your brain already? You would have to walk at least a mile before\r\nyou could find any; and what's the good of it, after all? It would all be\r\nwithered before you could get home.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can't help that,\" repeated Kitty: \"I shall have had it, at all events.\r\nAny way, I'm going, and you two can finish your dreams in peace.\"\r\n\r\nIt was useless to argue with Kitty when she was in that mood, so I\r\ncontented myself with giving her directions for reaching the nearest copse\r\nwhere she would be likely to find the fragrant beauty.\r\n\r\nTwo hours later Königin sat at the window gazing down the long sandy\r\nstreet. Suddenly her face changed, an expression of interest and surprise\r\ncame into her dreamy eyes: she put up her glass, and then broke into a\r\nlaugh. \"Come and look at this,\" she exclaimed; and I came.\r\n\r\nWhat I saw was only Kitty and the Jook, but Kitty and the Jook walking side\r\nby side in the most amicable manner--Kitty sparkling, bewitching, helpless,\r\nappealing by turns or altogether as only she could be; the Jook watching\r\nher with an expression of amusement and delight on his handsome face. And\r\nboth were laden with great wreaths and trails of yellow jessamine, golden\r\nchalices of fragrance, drooping sprays of green glistening leaves, until\r\nthey looked like walking bowers.\r\n\r\n\"How on earth--\" I exclaimed, and could get no further: my feelings choked\r\nme.\r\n\r\nKitty came in radiant and smiling as the morning, bearing her treasures. Of\r\ncourse we both pounced upon her: \"Kitty, where did you meet the Jook? How\r\ndid it happen? What did you do?\"\r\n\r\n\"Cows!\" said Kitty solemnly, with grave lips and twinkling eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Cows? Cows in Florida? Kitty, _what_ do you mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"A cow ran at me, and I was frightened and ran at Mr. Warriner. He drove\r\nthe cow off. That's all. Then he walked home with me. Any harm in that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, Kitty, the idea! A Florida cow run at you? If you had said a pig,\r\nthere might be some sense in it, for the pigs here do have some life about\r\nthem; but a cow! Why, the creatures have not strength enough to stand up:\r\nthey are all starving by inches.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can't help that,\" said Kitty. \"Must have thought I was good to eat, then,\r\nI suppose. I thought she was going to toss me, but I don't think it would\r\nbe much more agreeable to be eaten. Mr. Warriner is my preserver, anyhow,\r\nand I shall treat him _'as sich_.'\"\r\n\r\nKitty looked so mischievous and so mutinous that there was evidently no use\r\nin trying to get anything more out of her, and after standing there a few\r\nminutes fingering her blossoms and smiling to herself, she danced off to\r\ndress for tea.\r\n\r\n\"Selfish little thing, not to offer us one of those lovely sprays!\" I\r\nexclaimed, but Königin laughed: \"My dear, they are hallowed. Our touch\r\nwould profane them.\"\r\n\r\nKönigin always saw further than I did, and I gasped: \"Königin! you don't\r\nthink--\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh no, dear, not yet. Kitty is piqued, and wants to fascinate the Jook a\r\nlittle--just a little as yet, but she may burn her fingers before she gets\r\nthrough. Looks are contagious, and--did you see her face?\"\r\n\r\nSuch a brilliant little figure as slipped softly into the dining-room that\r\nevening, all wreathed and twisted and garlanded about with the shining\r\ngreen vines, gemmed with their golden stars. Head and throat and waist and\r\nround white arms were all twined with them, and blossoming sprays and knots\r\nof the delicately carved blossoms drooped or clung here and there amid her\r\nfloating hair and gauzy black drapery. How did the child ever make them\r\nstick? How had she managed to decorate herself so elaborately in the short\r\ntime that had elapsed since her return? But Kitty had ways of doing things\r\nunknown to duller mortals.\r\n\r\nNot a word had Kitty for me that evening, but for her father such clinging,\r\ncoaxing, wheedling ways, and for the Jook such coy, sparkling,\r\nartfully-accidental glances, such shy turns of the little head, such dainty\r\ncapricious airs, that it was delicious to watch her. Königin and I sat in a\r\ndark corner for the express purpose of admiring her delicate little\r\nmanuvres. As for her father, good stolid man! he was well used to Kitty's\r\nfreaks, and went on reading his newspaper in such a matter-of-fact way that\r\nshe might as well have wheedled the Pyramid of Cheops. The Jook, however,\r\nwas all that could be desired. The shyest of men--shy and proud as only an\r\nEnglishman can be--he could not make up his mind to walk directly up to\r\nKitty, as an American would do, as all the young Americans in the room\r\nwould have done if Kitty had let them. But Kitty, flighty little butterfly\r\nas she seemed, had stores of tact and finesse in that little brain of hers,\r\nand the power of developing a fine reserve which had already wilted more\r\nthan one of the young men of the house. For Kitty was none of your arrant\r\nand promiscuous flirts who count \"all fish that come to their net.\" She was\r\nchoice and dainty in her flirtations, but, possibly, none the less\r\ndangerous for that.\r\n\r\nThe Jook hovered about the room from chair to sofa, from sofa to\r\nwindow-seat, finding himself at each remove one degree nearer to Kitty.\r\n\r\n\"He is like a tame canary-bird,\" whispered Königin. \"Let it alone and it\r\nwill come up to you after a while, but speak to it and you frighten it off\r\nat once.\"\r\n\r\nAnd when at length he reached Kitty's side, how beautiful was the look of\r\nslight surprise, not _too_ strongly marked, and the half-shy pleasure in\r\nthe eyes which she raised to him; and then the coy little gesture with\r\nwhich she swept aside her draperies and made room for him. Half the power\r\nof Kitty's witcheries lay in her frank, childish manner, just dashed with\r\nwomanly reserve.\r\n\r\nWell! the Jook was thoroughly in the vortex now: there was no doubt about\r\nthat. Kitty might laugh as loud as she pleased, and he only looked charmed.\r\nKitty might frisk like a will-o'-the wisp, and he only admired her innocent\r\nvivacity. Even the bits of slang and the Americanisms which occasionally\r\nslipped from her only struck him as original and piquant. How would it all\r\nend? That neither Königin nor I could divine, for Kitty was not one to wear\r\nher heart upon her sleeve. It was very little that we saw of Kitty in\r\nthese days, for she was always wandering off somewhere, boating on the\r\nbroad placid river or lounging about \"Greenleaf's\" or driving--always with\r\nthe Jook for cavalier, and, if the excursions were long, with her father to\r\nplay propriety. When she did come into our room, she was not our own Kitty,\r\nwith her childish airs and merry laughter. This was a brilliant and\r\nvolatile little woman of the world, who rattled on in the most amusing\r\nmanner about everything--except the Jook. About him her lips never opened,\r\nand the most distant allusion to him on our part was sufficient to send her\r\nfluttering off on some pressing and suddenly remembered errand. Yet this\r\nreserve hardly seemed like the shyness of conscious but unacknowledged\r\nlove. On the contrary, we both fancied--Königin and I--that Kitty began to\r\nlook worried, and somehow, in watching her and the Jook, we began to be\r\nconscious that a sort of constraint had crept into her manner toward him.\r\nIt could be no doubt of his feelings that caused it, for no woman could\r\ndesire a bolder or more ardent lover than he had developed into, infected,\r\nno doubt, by the American atmosphere. Sometimes, too, we caught shy,\r\nwistful glances at the Jook from Kitty's eyes, hastily averted with an\r\nalmost guilty look if he turned toward her.\r\n\r\n\"What can it mean, Königin?\" I said. \"She looks as if she wanted to confess\r\nsome sin, and was afraid to.\"\r\n\r\n\"Some childish peccadillo,\" said Königin. \"In spite of all her\r\nwoman-of-the-world-ishness the child has a morbidly sensitive conscience,\r\nand is troubled about some nonsense that nobody else would think of twice.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can it be that she has only been flirting, and is frightened to find how\r\ndesperately in earnest he is?\"\r\n\r\n\"Possibly,\" replied Königin. \"But I fancy that she is too well used to that\r\nphase of affairs to let it worry her. Wait a while and we shall see.\"\r\n\r\nWe couldn't make anything of it, but even the Jook became worried at last\r\nby Kitty's queer behavior, and I suppose he thought he had better settle\r\nthe matter. For one evening, when I was keeping my room with a headache, I\r\nwas awakened from a light sleep by a sound of voices on the piazza outside\r\nof my window. It was some time before I was sufficiently wide awake to\r\nrealize that the speakers were Kitty and the Jook, and when I did I was in\r\na dilemma. To let them know that I was there would be to overwhelm them\r\nboth with confusion and interrupt their conversation at a most interesting\r\npoint, for the Jook had evidently just made his declaration. It was\r\nimpossible for me to leave the room, for I was by no means in a costume to\r\nmake my appearance in the public halls. On the whole, I concluded that the\r\nbest thing I could do would be to keep still and never, by word or look, to\r\nlet either of them know of my most involuntary eavesdropping.\r\n\r\nKitty was speaking when I heard them first, talking in a broken, hesitating\r\nvoice, which was very queer from our bright, fluent little Kitty: \"Mr.\r\nWarriner, you don't know what a humbug you make me feel when you talk of\r\n'my innocence' and 'unconsciousness' and 'lack of vanity,' and all the rest\r\nof it. I have been feeling more and more what a vain, deceitful,\r\nhypocritical little wretch I am ever since I knew you. I have been\r\nexpecting you to find me out every day, and I almost hoped you would.\"\r\n\r\n\"What _do_ you mean, Miss Grey?\" asked the Jook in tones of utter\r\namazement, as well he might.\r\n\r\n\"Oh dear! how shall I tell you?\" sighed poor Kitty; and I could _feel_ her\r\nblushes burning through her words. Then, with a sudden rush: \"Can't you\r\nsee? I feel as if I had _stolen_ your love, for it was all gained under\r\nfalse pretences. You never would have cared for me if you had known what a\r\nmiserable hypocrite I really was. Why, that very first day I wasn't afraid\r\nof the cow--she didn't even look at me--but I saw you coming,\r\nand--and--Helen wouldn't introduce you to me--and it just struck me it\r\nwould be a good chance, and so I rushed up to you and--Oh! what will you\r\nthink of me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Think?\" said the Jook: \"why, I think that while ninety-nine women out of\r\na hundred are hypocrites, not one in a thousand has the courage to atone\r\nfor it by an avowal like yours. Not that it was exactly hypocrisy, either.\"\r\n\r\nThe poor blundering Jook! Always saying the most maddening things under the\r\nfirm conviction that it was the most delicate compliment.\r\n\r\nKitty was too much in earnest to mind it now, though. \"Do you know,\" she\r\nwent on, \"that from the very first day I came into the house I was\r\ndetermined to captivate you?--that every word and every look was directed\r\nto that end? I have been nothing but an actress all through. I have done it\r\nbefore, hundreds and hundreds of times, but I never felt the shame of it\r\nuntil now--because--because--\"\r\n\r\n\"Because you never loved any one before? Is that it, Kitty?\" said the Jook\r\ntenderly.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I don't know,\" said Kitty desperately. \"How can I tell? But it's all\r\nHelen's fault. If she had introduced you to me in a rational way, I should\r\nnever have gone on so. But she wouldn't, and I was piqued--\"\r\n\r\n\"I must exonerate Miss Helen,\" interrupted the Jook. \"She wanted to\r\nintroduce me, and I declined. I am sure I don't know why--English reserve,\r\nI suppose. I had not seen you then, you know, and some of the people here\r\nare such a queer lot that I rather dreaded new acquaintances.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not Helen's fault?\" wailed Kitty. \"Oh, this is stolen--oh, poor Helen!\"\r\n\r\nNaturally, the Jook was utterly bewildered, but as for me I sprang up into\r\na sitting posture, for the meaning of Kitty's behavior had just flashed\r\nupon me. Absolutely, the poor little goose thought that in accepting the\r\nJook, as she was evidently dying to do, she would be robbing me of my\r\nlover. And she never guessed at my own little romance, tucked away safely\r\nin the most secret corner of my heart, which put any man save one quite out\r\nof the question for me. If I had stopped to think, I suppose I should not\r\nhave done what I did, but in my surprise the words came out before I\r\nthought: \"Good gracious, Kitty my dear! do take the Jook if you want him!\r\n_I_ don't.\"\r\n\r\nI could not help laughing when I realized what I had done. A little shriek\r\nfrom Kitty and a _very_ British exclamation from the Jook, a slight scuffle\r\nof chairs and a sense, rather than sound, of confusion, announced the\r\neffect of my words.\r\n\r\nI waited for their reply, but dead silence prevailed, so I was obliged to\r\nspeak again. \"You needn't be alarmed,\" I said, peering cautiously through\r\nthe chinks in the blinds, for I had approached the window by this time. \"I\r\ndidn't mean to listen, but I couldn't get out of the way, and I never\r\nintended to let you or any one else know that I had heard your\r\nconversation. I'm awfully sorry that I have disturbed you, but, as I am in\r\nfor it now, I might as well go on.\"\r\n\r\nThere I stopped, for I didn't exactly know what to say, and I hoped that\r\none of them would \"give me a lead.\" I could just catch a glimpse of their\r\nfaces in the moonlight. The Jook was staring straight at the window-shutter\r\nbehind which I lurked, and the wrath and disgust expressed in his handsome\r\nfeatures set me off into a silent chuckle. I was sorry for Kitty, though.\r\nHer face drooped as if it were weighed down by its own blushes, and the\r\nlong lashes quivered upon the hot cheeks.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, really, Miss Helen,\" spoke the Jook at last, \"this is a most\r\nunexpected pleasure. Ah, really, you know, I mean--\"\r\n\r\nIt was not very lucid, but it was all I needed, and I replied suavely, \"Oh\r\nyes, I understand. You never asked me, and never had the faintest idea of\r\ndoing so. Otherwise, we should not have been such good friends. All I want\r\nis to enforce the fact on Kitty's mind.--And now, Kitty, my dear, if you\r\nare quite satisfied on this point, I will dress and go down stairs.--Don't\r\ndisturb yourselves, pray!\" for both of them showed signs of moving. \"You\r\ncan finish your conversation to much better advantage where you are, and\r\nthis little excitement has quite cured my headache.\"\r\n\r\nI wonder how in the world they ever took up the dropped stitches in that\r\nconversation? They did it somehow, though, for when they reappeared Kitty\r\nwas the prettiest possible picture of shy, blushing, shamefaced happiness,\r\nwhile the Jook was fairly beaming with pride and delight. It was a case of\r\ntrue love at last: there was no doubt about that--such love as few would\r\nhave believed that a flighty little creature like Kitty was capable of\r\nfeeling. It was wonderful to see how quickly all her little wiles and\r\ncoquetries fell off under its influence, just as the rosy, fluttering\r\nleaves of the spring fall off when the fruit pushes its way. I don't\r\nbelieve it had ever struck her before that there was anything degrading in\r\nthis playing fast and loose with men's hearts which had been her favorite\r\npastime, or in beguiling them by feigning a passion of which she had never\r\nfelt one thrill. It was not until Love the magician had touched her heart\r\nthat the honest and loyal little Kitty that lay at the bottom of all her\r\nwhims and follies was developed. The very sense of unworthiness which she\r\nfelt in view of the Jook's straightforward and manly ardor was the surest\r\nguarantee for the perfection of her cure.\r\n\r\nA truce to moralizing. Kitty does not need it, nor the Jook either. If he\r\nis not proud of the bright little American bride he is to take back with\r\nhim to the \"tight little isle\" of our forefathers, why, appearances are\r\n\"deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked.\"\r\n\r\nHENRIETTA H. HOLDICH.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMMUNISM IN THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\n\r\nNowhere in the history of the world have we any example of successful\r\ncommunism. The ancient Cretan and Lacedemonian experiments, the efforts of\r\nthe Essenes and early Christians, the modified communities of St. Anthony\r\nand several orders of monks, the schemes of the Anabaptists of the\r\nsixteenth century, together with all the experiments of modern times, have\r\nproved essential failures. Setting out with ideas of perfection in the\r\nsocial state, and undertaking nothing less than the entire abolition of the\r\nmiseries of the world, the communists of all times have lived in a\r\ncondition the least ideal that can be imagined. The usual course of\r\nsocialistic communities has been to start out with a great flourish, to\r\nquarrel and divide after a few months, and then to decrease and degenerate\r\nuntil a final dispersion by general consent ended the attempt. During the\r\nshort existence of nearly all such communities the members have lived in\r\nwant of the ordinary comforts of life, in dispute about their respective\r\nrights and duties, at law with retiring members, and battling with the\r\nwilds and malarias of the countries in which alone anything like practical\r\ncommunism has been usually possible. The most successful (so far as any of\r\nthese attempts can be called successful) have been those communities which\r\nhave been founded on a religion and which have consisted entirely of\r\nmembers of one faith. But all political communism has utterly failed, and\r\nthe name is little more than a synonym for the most egregious blunders,\r\nexcesses and crimes of which visionary and unpractical people can be\r\nguilty.\r\n\r\nThe United States seem ill suited for the spread of communistic ideas,\r\nnotwithstanding they contain almost the only socialistic communities to be\r\nfound anywhere. Though the people are free to live in common if they\r\ndesire, and although land and every facility are offered on easy terms for\r\nthe realization of communism--which is not the case in Europe (and which\r\nis, therefore, the reason why the New World is chosen for communistic\r\nexperiments)--yet there is felt no need of communism here. There are\r\nneither the political nor the social inducements for it which exist in\r\nEurope, and all efforts to excite an enthusiasm on the subject have\r\ninvariably failed. Almost the only agitators are foreigners, and nearly all\r\nthe existing communities are composed of foreigners. Of these, two only are\r\npolitical, the Icarian and the Cedar Vale, while the rest are religious.\r\n\r\nThe Icarian Community in Adams county, Iowa, about two miles from Corning,\r\na station on the Burlington and Missouri River Railroad, is the result of\r\nan effort to realize the communistic theory of M. Cabet, a French writer\r\nand politician of some note. It is perhaps the most just and practical of\r\nall communistic systems; for the reader will remember that social systems\r\nare as numerous in France as religious systems are in this country, and\r\ntake much the same place in the passions and bigotries of the people of\r\nFrance, where there is but one religion, as our various sects do here,\r\nwhere there are so many. The system of M. Cabet differs from the others in\r\nmuch the same manner as our religious sects differ from one another; which\r\nis not of much importance to the outside world, as they all contain the one\r\nprinciple of a community of goods. M. Cabet first promulgated his system in\r\nthe shape of a romance entitled _A Voyage to Icaria_, in which he\r\nrepresented the community at work under the most favorable circumstances\r\nand in a high degree of prosperity. According to his system, all goods are\r\nto be held in common, and all the people are to have an equal voice in the\r\ndisposal of them. Each is to contribute of labor and capital all that he\r\ncan for the common good, and to get all that he needs from the common fund.\r\n\"From each according to his ability--to each according to his wants,\" is\r\nthe formula of principles. The practical working of the community will\r\nfurther illustrate the system.\r\n\r\nIn 1848, M. Cabet, with some three thousand of his followers, sailed from\r\nFrance for New Orleans, intending to take up land in Texas or Arkansas on\r\nwhich to establish a community, having the promise that he would soon be\r\nfollowed by ten thousand more of his disciples. After spending several\r\nmonths in reconnoitring, during which half of his followers got\r\ndiscontented and left him, he settled with about fifteen hundred at Nauvoo,\r\nIllinois, where they bought out the property of the Mormons, who had\r\nrecently been driven from that place. There they commenced operations,\r\nestablishing a saw- and grist-mill, and carrying on farming and several\r\nbranches of domestic manufacturing. In a little while they sent out a\r\nbranch colony to Icaria, in Adams county, Iowa, where they purchased, or\r\nentered under the Homestead Act, four thousand acres of land. In this place\r\nlikewise they built a mill and went to farming and carrying on the more\r\nsimple trades. In a little while, however, a quarrel arose in the principal\r\ncommunity at Nauvoo in regard to the use and abuse of power, when, after a\r\nrage of passion not unlike that which they had exhibited in the Revolution\r\nof 1848 in France, M. Cabet, with a large minority, seceded and went to St.\r\nLouis, where they expected to form another and more perfect community. They\r\nnever formed this community, however, and were soon dispersed. The\r\ncommunity at Nauvoo, being now harassed with debts and with lawsuits\r\ngrowing out of the withdrawal of M. Cabet and his party, repaired to their\r\nbranch colony at Icaria, where they have been ever since. Here they had\r\nlikewise frequent disputes and withdrawals, often giving rise to lawsuits\r\nand a loss of property, until in 1866, when the writer first visited them,\r\nthey were reduced to thirty-five members. Since that time they have picked\r\nup a few members, mostly old companions who had left them for individual\r\nlife, until now they have about sixty in all. They own at present about two\r\nthousand acres of land, of which three hundred and fifty are under\r\ncultivation. They have good stock, consisting of about one hundred and\r\ntwenty head of cattle, five hundred sheep, two hundred and fifty hogs and\r\nthirty horses. They still have their saw- and grist-mill, now run by steam,\r\nbut give most of their time to farming. They preserve the family relation,\r\nand observe the strictest rules of chastity. Each family lives in a\r\nseparate house, but they all eat at a common table. By an economic division\r\nof labor one man cooks for all these persons, another bakes, another\r\nattends to the dairy, another makes the shoes, another the clothes; and in\r\ngeneral one man manages some special work for the whole. No one has any\r\nmoney or need of any. All purchases are made from the common purse, and\r\neach gets what he needs. The government is a pure democracy. The officers\r\nare chosen once a year by universal (male) suffrage, and consist of a\r\npresident, secretary (and treasurer), director of agriculture and director\r\nof industry. They have no religion, but, like most of the European\r\ncommunists, are free-thinkers. They are highly moral, however, and much\r\nesteemed by their neighbors. Some of them are quite learned, and all of\r\nthem may be pronounced decidedly heroic for the terrible privations they\r\nhave undergone in order to realize their political principles, to which\r\nthey are as strongly and sincerely devoted as any Christian to his\r\nreligion.\r\n\r\nSuch is a sketch of the most perfect system and most successful experiment\r\nof political communism in the United States--not very encouraging, it will\r\nbe confessed. The other example of political communism is the Cedar Vale\r\nCommunity in Howard county, Kansas, which needs only to be mentioned here,\r\nas it has as yet no history. It was commenced in 1871, and is composed of\r\nRussian materialists and American spiritualists. They have a community of\r\ngoods like the Icarians, and in general their principles are the same. They\r\nhad only about a dozen members at last accounts. Another and similar\r\ncommunity was established in 1874 in Chesterfield county, Virginia, called\r\nthe \"Social Freedom Community,\" its principles being enunciated as a \"unity\r\nof interest and political, religious and social freedom;\" but we cannot\r\ndiscover whether it is yet in existence, as at last accounts it had only\r\ntwo full members and eight probationers. It will be seen from these\r\nexamples that the prospects of political communism are far from promising.\r\nIts principal power has always been as a sentiment, and it can be dreaded\r\nonly as an appeal to the destitute and lawless to rise in acts of violence.\r\nIt has been powerful in France in revolutions, riots and mobs, and in this\r\ncountry in aiding the late strikers in their work of destruction.\r\n\r\nThe other existing communities are founded on some religious basis, being\r\nefforts on the part of their founders to secure their religious rights or\r\nto live with those of the same faith in closer relations. And although\r\ntheir measures have been similar in many respects to those of the political\r\ncommunists, they have resorted to them not on account of any political\r\nprinciples, but because they believed them to be commanded by Scripture or\r\nto grow out of some peculiarity of religious faith or duty. Most of them\r\nhave been formed after the model of the society of the apostles, who had\r\ntheir goods in common, and because of their example. None, so far as we\r\nknow, have ever proposed to establish communities by force or to have the\r\nwhole people embraced in them. Held together by their peculiar religious\r\nprinciples, they have been far more successful (especially when under some\r\nshrewd leader whom they believed to have a spiritual authority) than when\r\nactuated purely by reason.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most successful of these religious communities is that of the\r\n\"True Inspirationists,\" known as the Amana Community, in Iowa,\r\nseventy-eight miles west of Iowa City, on the Chicago, Rock Island and\r\nPacific Railroad. These are all Germans, who came to this country in 1842,\r\nand settled at first near Buffalo, New York, on a tract of land called\r\nEbenezer, from which they are sometimes known as \"Ebenezers.\" This tract\r\ncomprised five thousand acres of land, including what is now a part of the\r\ncity of Buffalo. In 1855 they moved to their present locality in Iowa. They\r\npretend to be under direct inspiration, receiving from God the model and\r\ngeneral orders for the direction of their community. The present head,\r\nboth spiritual and temporal, is a woman, a sort of sibyl who negotiates the\r\ninspirations. Their business affairs are managed by thirteen trustees,\r\nchosen annually by the male members, who also choose the president. They\r\nare very religious, though having but little outward form. There are\r\nfourteen hundred and fifty members, who live in seven different towns or\r\nvillages, which are all known by the name of Amana--East Amana, West Amana,\r\netc. They have their property for the most part in common. Each family has\r\na house, to which food is daily distributed. The work is done by a prudent\r\ndivision of labor, as in the Icarian community. But instead of providing\r\nclothing and incidentals, the community makes to each person an allowance\r\nfor this purpose--to the men of from forty to one hundred dollars a year,\r\nto the women from twenty-five to thirty dollars, and to the children from\r\nfive to ten dollars. There are public stores in the community at which the\r\nmembers can get all they need besides food, and at which also strangers can\r\ndeal. They dress very plainly, use simple food, and are quite industrious.\r\nThey aim to keep the men and women apart as much as possible. They sit\r\napart at the tables and in church, and when divine service is dismissed the\r\nmen remain in their ranks until the women get out of church and nearly\r\nhome. In their games and amusements they keep apart, as well as in all\r\ncombinations whether for business or pleasure. The boys play with boys and\r\nthe girls with girls. They marry at twenty-four. They own at present\r\ntwenty-five thousand acres of land, a considerable part of which is under\r\ncultivation. They have, in round numbers, three thousand sheep, fifteen\r\nhundred head of cattle, two hundred horses and twenty-five hundred hogs.\r\nBesides farming, they carry on two woollen-mills, four saw-mills, two\r\ngrist-mills and a tannery. They are almost entirely self-supporting in the\r\narts, working up their own products and living off the result. In medicine\r\nthey are homopathists.\r\n\r\nThe \"Rappists\" or Harmony Society at Economy, Pennsylvania, is composed of\r\nabout one hundred members, being all that remain of a colony of six hundred\r\nwho came from Germany in 1803. They were called Separatists or\r\n\"Come-outers\" in their own country, and much persecuted on account of their\r\nnonconformity with the established Church. They landed in Baltimore, and\r\nsome of them who never found their way into the community, or who\r\nsubsequently withdrew, settled in Maryland and Pennsylvania, where they are\r\nstill known as a religious sect. Those who remained together purchased five\r\nthousand acres of land north of Pittsburg, in the valley of the\r\nConoquenessing. In 1814 they moved to Posey county, Indiana, in the Wabash\r\nValley, where they purchased thirty thousand acres of land, and in 1824\r\nthey moved back again to their present locality in Pennsylvania. In 1831 a\r\ndissension arose among them, and a division was effected by one Bernard\r\nMueller--or \"Count Maximilian\" as he called himself--who went off with\r\none-third of the members and a large share of the property, and founded a\r\nnew community at Phillips, ten miles off, on eight hundred acres of land,\r\nwhich, however, soon disbanded on account of internal quarrels.\r\n\r\nThe peculiarity of this community is that there is no intercourse between\r\nthe sexes of any kind. In 1807 they gave up marriage. The husbands parted\r\nfrom their wives, and have henceforth lived with them only as sisters. They\r\nclaim to have authority for this in the words of the apostle: \"This I say,\r\nbrethren, the time is short; it remaineth that both they that have wives be\r\nas though they had none,\" etc. They teach that Adam in his perfect state\r\nwas bi-sexual and had no need of a female, being in this respect like God;\r\nthat subsequently, when he fell, the female part (rib, etc.) was separated\r\nfrom him and made into another person, and that when they become perfect\r\nthrough their religion the bi-sexual nature of the soul is restored.\r\nChrist, they claim, was also of this dual nature, and therefore never\r\nmarried. They believe that the world will soon come to an end, and that it\r\nis their duty to help it along by having no children, and so putting an end\r\nto the race as well as the planet.\r\n\r\nTheir property is all held in common and managed by a council of seven,\r\nfrom whom the trustees are chosen. From four to eight live in each house,\r\nmen and women together, who regard each other as of the same sex, and are\r\nnever watched. Each household cooks for itself, although there is a general\r\nbakery, from which bread is taken around to the houses as they have need.\r\nThe members are fond of music and flowers, but they discard dancing. Though\r\nGermans, they have ceased to use tobacco; which loss, it is said, the men\r\nfeel more heavily than that of the wives. They make considerable wine and\r\nbeer, which they drink in moderation. They are said to be worth from two\r\nmillions to three millions of dollars, and speculate in mines, oil-wells,\r\nsaw-mills, etc., doing very little hard work, and hiring laborers from\r\nwithout to take their places in all drudgery. They are engaged principally\r\nin farming and the common trades, and supply nearly everything for\r\nthemselves. They are nearly all aged, none of them being under forty except\r\nsome adopted children. All are Germans and use the German language.\r\n\r\nThe Shakers are the oldest society of communists in the United States. The\r\nparent society at Mount Lebanon, New York, was established in 1792, being\r\nthe outgrowth of a religious revival in which there were violent hysterical\r\nmanifestations or \"shakes,\" from which they took their name. In this\r\nrevival one Ann Lee, known among them as \"Mother Ann,\" was prominent. This\r\nwoman, of English birth, emigrated to Niskayuna, New York, about seven\r\nmiles north-west of Albany, where she pretended to speak from inspiration\r\nand work miracles, so that the people soon came to regard her as being\r\nanother revelation of Christ and as having his authority. Being persecuted\r\nby the outside world, her followers, after her death, formed a community in\r\nwhich to live and enjoy their religion alone and: undisturbed. Their\r\nprinciples may be summed up as special revelation, spiritualism, celibacy,\r\noral confession, community, non-resistance, peace, the gift of healing,\r\nmiracles, physical health and separation from the world. Like the Rappists,\r\nthey neither marry nor have any substitute for marriage, receiving all\r\ntheir children by adoption. They live in large families or communes,\r\nconsisting of eighty or ninety members, in one big house, men and women\r\ntogether. Each brother is assigned to a sister, who mends his clothes,\r\nlooks after his washing, tells him when he needs a new garment, reproves\r\nhim when not orderly, and has a spiritual oversight over him generally.\r\nThough living in the same house, the sexes eat, labor and work apart. They\r\nkeep apart and in separate ranks in their worship. They do not shake hands\r\nwith the opposite sex, and there is rarely any scandal or gossip among\r\nthem, so far as the outside world can learn. There are two orders, known as\r\nthe Novitiate and the Church order, the latter having intercourse only with\r\ntheir own members in a sort of monkish seclusion, while the others treat\r\nwith the outside world. The head of a Shaker society is a \"ministry,\"\r\nconsisting of from three to four persons, male and female. The society is\r\ndivided into families, as stated above, each family having two elders, one\r\nmale and one female. In their worship they are drawn up in ranks and go\r\nthrough various gyrations, consisting of processions and dances, during\r\nwhich they continually hold out their hands as if to receive something. The\r\nShakers are industrious, hard-working, economical and cleanly. They dress\r\nuniformly. Their houses are all alike. They say \"yea\" and \"nay,\" although\r\nnot \"thee\" and \"thou,\" and call persons by their first names. They confine\r\nthemselves chiefly to the useful, and use no ornaments. There are at\r\npresent eighteen societies of Shakers in the United States, scattered\r\nthroughout seven States. They number in all two thousand four hundred and\r\nfifteen persons, and own one hundred thousand acres of land. Their\r\nindustries are similar to those of the Rappists and True Inspirationists,\r\nand are somewhat famed for the excellence of their products. The Shakers\r\nare nearly all Americans, like the Oneidans, next mentioned, and unlike all\r\nother communistic societies in the United States.\r\n\r\nThe Perfectionists of Oneida and Wallingford are perhaps the most singular\r\nof all communists. They were founded by John Humphrey Noyes, who organized\r\na community at Putney, Vermont, in 1846. In 1848 this was consolidated with\r\nothers at Oneida in Madison county, New York. In 1849 a branch community\r\nwas started at Brooklyn, New York, and in 1850 one at Wallingford,\r\nConnecticut, all of which have since broken up or been merged in the two\r\ncommunities of Oneida and Wallingford. Their principles are perfectionism,\r\ncommunism and free love. By \"perfection\" they mean freedom from sin, which\r\nthey all claim to have, or to seek as practically attainable. They claim,\r\nin explaining their sense of this term, that as a man who does not drink is\r\nfree from intemperance, and one who does not swear is free from profanity,\r\nso one who does not sin at all is free from sin, or morally perfect. Their\r\ncommunism is like that of the Icarians, so far as property is concerned,\r\nthis being owned equally by all for the benefit of all as they severally\r\nhave need; which state they claim is the state of man after the\r\nresurrection. But they have a community not only of goods, but also of\r\nwives; or, rather, they have no wives at all, but all women belong to all\r\nmen, and all men to all women; which they assert to be the state of Nature,\r\nand therefore the most perfect state. They call it complex marriage instead\r\nof simple, and it is both polygamy and polyandry at the same time. They are\r\nenemies of all exclusiveness or selfishness, and hold that there should be\r\nno exclusiveness in money or in women or children. Their idea is to be in\r\nthe most literal sense no respecters of persons. All women and children are\r\nthe same to all men, and _vice versâ_. A man never knows his own children,\r\nand the mothers, instead of raising their children themselves, give them\r\nover to a common nursery, somewhat after the suggestion of Plato in his\r\n_Republic_. If any two persons are suspected of forming special\r\nattachments, and so of violating the principle of equal and universal love,\r\nor of using their sexual freedom too liberally, they are put under\r\ndiscipline. They are very religious, their religion, however, consisting\r\nonly in keeping free from sin. They have no sermons, ceremonies, sacraments\r\nor religious manifestations whatever. There are no public prayers, and no\r\nloud prayers at all. Their method of discipline is called \"criticism,\" and\r\nconsists in bringing the offender into the presence of a committee of men\r\nand women, who each pass their criticisms on him and allow him to confess\r\nor criticise himself. The least sign of worldliness or evidence of\r\nimpropriety is enough to subject one to this ordeal. They are very careful\r\nabout whom they admit to their community, as there are numerous rakes and\r\nidlers who make application on the supposition that it is a harem or\r\nTurkish paradise. None are admitted who are not imbued with their doctrine\r\nof perfection, and who do not show evidences of it in their lives. In a\r\nbusiness point of view, they are comparatively successful, the original\r\nmembers having contributed over one hundred thousand dollars' worth of\r\nproperty, which has not depreciated. They engage in farming, wine-raising\r\nand various industries, and are known in the general markets for their\r\nproducts.\r\n\r\nThe Separatists at Zoar, Ohio, about halfway between Cleveland and\r\nPittsburg, are a body of Germans who fled from Würtemberg in 1817 to escape\r\nreligious persecution. They are mystics, followers of Jacob Böhm, Gerhard,\r\nTerstegen, Jung Stilling and others of that class, and considerably above\r\nthe average of communists in intellect and culture. They were aided to\r\nemigrate to this country by some English Quakers, with whom there is a\r\nresemblance in some of their tenets. They purchased fifty-six hundred acres\r\nof land in Ohio, but did not at first intend to form a community, having\r\nbeen driven to that resort subsequently in order to the better realization\r\nof their religious principles. They now own over seven thousand acres of\r\nland in Ohio, besides some in Iowa. They have a woollen-factory, two\r\nflour-mills, a saw-mill, a planing-mill, a machine-shop, a tannery and a\r\ndye-house; also a hotel and store for the accommodation of their neighbors.\r\nThey are industrious, simple in their dress and food, and very economical.\r\nThey use neither tobacco nor pork, and are homopathists in medicine. In\r\nreligion they are orthodox, with the usual latitude of mystics. They have\r\nno ceremonies, say \"thou\" and \"thee,\" take off their hats and bow to nobody\r\nexcept God, refuse to fight or go to law, and settle their disputes by\r\narbitration. At first they prohibited marriage and had their women in\r\ncommon, like the Perfectionists. In 1828, however, they commenced to break\r\ntheir rules and take wives. Now they observe the marriage state. Their\r\nofficers are elected by the whole society, the women voting as well as the\r\nmen.\r\n\r\nThe Bethel and Aurora communities--the former in Shelby county, Missouri,\r\nforty-eight miles from Hannibal, and the latter in Oregon, twenty-nine\r\nmiles south of Portland, on the Oregon and California Railroad--were\r\nfounded in 1848 by Dr. Kiel, a Prussian mystic, who practised medicine a\r\nwhile in New York and Pittsburg, and subsequently formed a religious sect\r\nof which these communists are members. He was subsequently joined by some\r\nof \"Count Maximilian's\" people, who had left Rapp's colony at Economy,\r\nwhich this closely resembles except as to celibacy. He first founded the\r\ncolony in Missouri, where he took up two thousand five hundred and sixty\r\nacres of land, and established the usual trades needed by farmers. In 1847\r\nthere were the inevitable quarrel and division. In 1855 he set out to\r\nestablish a similar community on the Pacific coast. The first settlement\r\nwas made at Shoalwater Bay, Washington Territory, which was, however,\r\nsubsequently abandoned for the present one at Aurora. There are now about\r\nfour hundred members at Aurora, who own eighteen thousand acres of land,\r\nand have the usual shops and occupations of communists mentioned above,\r\ncarrying on a considerable trade with their neighbors. The members of both\r\ncommunities are all either Germans or Pennsylvania Dutch, and thrive by the\r\nindustry and economy peculiar to those people. Their government is\r\nparental, intended to be like God's. Kiel is the temporal and spiritual\r\nhead. Their religion consists in practical benevolence, the forms of\r\nworship being Lutheran. They are thought to be exceedingly wealthy, but if\r\ntheir property were divided among them there would be less than three\r\nthousand dollars to each family, which, though more than the property of\r\nmost other communities would average, is but small savings for twenty\r\nyears. They preserve the usual family relations.\r\n\r\nThe Bishop Hill Community, in Henry county, Illinois, was formed by a party\r\nof Swedes who came to this country in 1846 under Eric Janson, who had been\r\ntheir religious leader in the Old World, where they were greatly persecuted\r\non account of their peculiar religious views. They suffered great hardships\r\nin effecting a first settlement, some of them going off, in the interest of\r\nthe community, to dig gold in California, and others taking to\r\nstock-raising and speculating. In this they were quite successful, so that\r\njobs and speculations became the peculiar work of this community. They took\r\nvarious public and private contracts; among others, one to grade a large\r\nportion of the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad and to build some of\r\nits bridges. In 1859 they owned ten thousand acres of good land, and had\r\nthe finest cattle in the State. In 1859, however, the young people became\r\ndiscontented and wished to dissolve the community. They divided the\r\nproperty in 1860, when one faction continued the community with its share.\r\nIn 1861 this party also broke up, separating into three divisions. In 1862\r\nthese again divided the property after numerous lawsuits. A small fraction,\r\nI believe, still continues a community on the ruins. In this community the\r\nfamilies lived separately, but ate all together. They had no president or\r\nsingle head, the business being transacted by a board of trustees. Their\r\nreligion was their principal concern.\r\n\r\nSuch are the strictly communistic societies in the United States. It will\r\nbe seen that they are each of such very peculiar views that they are\r\nspecially fitted by their very oddity for a life in common, and specially\r\ndisqualified from the same cause to extend or embrace others; for while\r\ntheir community of oddity makes them, by a necessarily strong sympathy, fit\r\nassociates to be together, it separates them by an impassable gulf from the\r\nappreciation and sympathy of the rest of mankind, who are interested only\r\nin the ordinary common-sense concerns of life.\r\n\r\nBesides these, there are several other colonies which, though not\r\ncommunistic, have grown out of an attempt to solve some of the questions\r\nraised by socialism. They are for the most part co-operative. The following\r\nare the principal: The Anaheim colony in California, thirty-six miles from\r\nLos Angelos, which was formed by a large number of Germans in 1857, who\r\nbanded together and purchased a large tract of land, on which they\r\nsuccessfully cultivate the vine in large quantities. The property is held\r\nand worked all together, but the interests are separate, and will be\r\ndivided in due time. Vineland, New Jersey, on the railroad between\r\nPhiladelphia and Cape May, is another. It was purchased and laid out by\r\nCharles K. Landis in 1861 as a private speculation, and to draw the\r\novercrowded population of Philadelphia into the country, where the people\r\ncould all have comfortable homes and support themselves by their own labor.\r\nSome fifty thousand acres of land were purchased, and sold at a low rate\r\nand on long time to actual settlers and improvers. As a result, some twelve\r\nthousand people have been drawn thither, who cultivate all this tract and\r\nwork numerous industries besides. No liquors are allowed to be sold in the\r\nplace, so that the population is exceptionally moral as well as\r\nindustrious, and offers a model example of low rates and good government. A\r\nsuccessful colony exists also at Prairie Home in Franklin county, Kansas,\r\nwhich was founded by a Frenchman, Monsieur E.V. Boissière. It is designed\r\nto be an association and co-operation based on attractive industry; a large\r\nnumber of persons contributing their capital and labor under stringent\r\nlaws, the proceeds to be divided among them whenever a majority shall so\r\ndesire. I might mention other associations of this kind, which are, in\r\nfact, however, only a variety of partnership or corporation.\r\n\r\nIt strikes me, however, that this is the only practical remedy for the\r\nevils which are aimed at by the communists, as far as they are remedial by\r\nsocial means. If a number of working people, with the capital which their\r\nsmall savings will amount to (which is always large enough for any ordinary\r\nbusiness if there be any considerable number of them), can be induced to\r\norganize themselves under competent leaders, and work for a few years\r\ntogether as faithfully as they ordinarily do for employers, they might\r\nrealize considerable results, and get the advantage of their own work\r\ninstead of enriching capitalists. But the difficulty is, that this class\r\nhave not, as a rule, learned either to manage great enterprises or to\r\nsubmit to those who are wisest among them, but break up in disorder and\r\ndivisions when their individual preferences are crossed. The first lesson\r\nthat a man must learn who proposes to do anything in common with others\r\n(and the more so if there be many of them) is to submit and forbear. With a\r\nlittle schooling our people ought, to a greater extent than at present, to\r\nbe able to co-operate in large numbers in firms and corporations where the\r\nmembers and stockholders shall themselves do all the work and receive all\r\nthe profits, and so avoid the two extremes of making profits for\r\ncapitalists and paying their earnings to officers and directors.\r\n\r\nAUSTIN BIERBOWER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOUR MONTHLY GOSSIP.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES FROM MOSCOW.\r\n\r\nJUNE 1 (May 20, Russian style), 1877.\r\n\r\nThis diversity in the matter of dates is unpleasantly perplexing at times.\r\nWith every sensation of interest and pleasure I set myself about the task\r\nof describing, I must at once begin to reckon. Twelve days' difference!\r\nYes, I have already grasped that fact, but then in which direction must the\r\ndeduction begin?--backward or forward? Such is the question that instantly\r\narises, and if we are at the fag end of one month and the beginning of\r\nanother, the amount of reckoning involved seems somewhat inadequate to the\r\noccasion. The Russian clergy, it is said--those, at any rate, of the lowest\r\nclass, designated as \"white priests,\" many of them peasants by birth and\r\nmarvellously illiterate--have ever been averse to any change being made in\r\nthe calendar, in order that their seasons of fasting and feasting may not\r\nbe disturbed.\r\n\r\n_Apropos_ of priests and priesthood. Whilst quietly at work yesterday\r\nmorning my attention was suddenly called off, first by a hurried\r\nexclamation, and then the inharmonious--ah, how utterly\r\ndiscordant!--ding-donging of church-bells. \"Listen!\" fell upon my ear: \"one\r\nof the secular priests belonging to St. Gregory's church died two days ago,\r\nand is to be buried this morning. They are still saying masses over his\r\nbody, the church is packed, and it is a sight such as you may possibly not\r\nhave an opportunity of again witnessing.\" In half an hour we were within\r\nthe church-walls. The place was already thronged, and the air close almost\r\nto suffocation. Never can one forget that peculiar heat, the sort of\r\nindescribable vapor, that arose, and the perspiration that streamed down\r\nthe faces of all present, each of whom, from the oldest to the youngest,\r\ncarried a lighted candle. After many vigorous efforts, and occasional\r\ncollisions with the flaring tapers, the wax or tallow dropping at intervals\r\nupon our cloaks, we found ourselves at last in the centre of the edifice,\r\nimmediately behind a dozen or more officiating priests clad in magnificent\r\nrobes, before whom lay their late confrère reposing in his coffin, and\r\ndressed, according to custom, in his ecclesiastical robes. Tall lighted\r\ncandles draped with crape surrounded him, and the solemn chant had been\r\ngoing on around him ever since life had become extinct. The dead in Russia\r\nare never left alone or in the dark. Relays of singing priests take the\r\nplaces of those who are weary, and friends keep watch in an adjoining room.\r\nThe Russian temperament inclines to the strongest manifestation of the\r\ninmost feelings, and the method here of mourning for the dead is\r\nexceptionally demonstrative. The corpse of the old priest lay surrounded by\r\nwhat was of bright colors or purest white, the coffin being of the\r\nlast-mentioned hue. Black was utterly proscribed. The face and hands were\r\nhalf buried in a lacy texture, whilst on the brow was placed a label,\r\n\"fillet-fashion,\" on which was written \"The Thrice Holy,\" or\r\n_Trisagion_--\"O Holy God! O Holy Mighty! O Holy Immortal! have mercy upon\r\nus!\"\r\n\r\nChant after chant ascended for the repose of his soul. The deacon's deep\r\nbass voice rose ever and anon in leading fashion, the other voices\r\nfollowing suit. There was of course no instrumental music. This Russian\r\nsinging is curiously unique--of a character wholly different from any heard\r\nelsewhere. It is weird in the extreme, and, if the expression be\r\npermissible, gypsy-like. The deacons' voices are of wonderful capability,\r\nthe popular belief being that they are specially chosen on account of this\r\npeculiar power. At last there came a pause. Not only the priests' and\r\ndeacons' voices, but those of the chanting men and boys--alike unsurpliced\r\nand uncassocked, lacking, therefore, much of the attraction offered by a\r\nservice in the Western Catholic Church--had all at once ceased to be\r\nheard. All were now pressing forward to kiss the dead priest--his\r\nfellow-priests first, and then, duly in order, all his relations and\r\nfriends. \"The last kiss\" it is termed--a practice, it would seem, derived\r\nfrom the heathen custom, of which we find such frequent mention. None, if\r\npossible, omit the performance of this duty, all seeking to obtain the\r\nblessing or benefit, supposed to be thereby conferred. Some, however, are\r\nobliged to content themselves with merely kissing the corners of the\r\ncoffin.\r\n\r\nMany of the numerous _stichera_, as they are termed--poetically-worded\r\nprose effusions--made use of in the course of the service are curiously\r\nquaint. I quote two or three, of which I have since procured a translation:\r\n\"Come, my brethren, let us give our last kiss, our last farewell, to our\r\ndeceased brother. He hath now forsaken his kindred and approacheth the\r\ngrave, no longer mindful of vanity or the cares of the world. Where are now\r\nhis kindred and friends? Behold, we are now separated! Approach! embrace\r\nhim who lately was one of yourselves.\"--\"Where now is the graceful form?\r\nWhere is youth? Where is the brightness of the eye? where the beauty of the\r\ncomplexion? Closed are the eyes, the feet bound, the hands at rest: extinct\r\nis the sense of hearing, and the tongue locked up in silence.\"\r\n\r\nThe words succeeding these are supposed to emanate from the lips of the\r\ndead, lying mute before the eyes of all present: \"Brethren, friends,\r\nkinsmen and acquaintance, view me here lying speechless, breathless, and\r\nlament. But yesterday we conversed together. Come near, all who are bound\r\nto me by affection, and with a last embrace pronounce the last farewell. No\r\nlonger shall I sojourn among you, no longer bear part in your discourse.\r\nPray earnestly that I be received into the Light of life.\"\r\n\r\nThe absolution having been pronounced by the priest, a paper is placed in\r\nthe dead man's hand--\"The Prayer, Hope and Confession of a faithful\r\nChristian soul.\" This is accompanied by another prayer containing the\r\nwritten words of absolution. This custom has given rise to the belief in\r\nthe minds of many foreigners that such missives are presented in the light\r\nof passports to a better world; but the idea seems to be as erroneous as it\r\nis absurd. Moreover, I believe that, strictly speaking, the custom is one\r\nof national origin, and that the Church has had nothing to do with its\r\nadoption.\r\n\r\nAll the lighted tapers having been taken away by one of the attendants, the\r\ncoffin with its gilded ornaments was removed slowly from its resting-place,\r\nand placed upon an enormous open bier or hearse, extensively mounted and\r\nheavily ornamented with white watered silk, purple and gilt draperies, a\r\ngilt crown surmounting all. The base of the ponderous vehicle was alone\r\npermitted to boast a fringe of deep black cloth--as if, however, for the\r\nsole purpose of hiding the wheels. The six horses, three abreast, were also\r\nenveloped in black cloth drapery touching the ground on either side. Right\r\nand left of the coffin itself, and mounted therefore considerably aloft,\r\nstood two yellow _stoicharioned_ (or robed) deacons, wearing the\r\n_epimanikia_ and _orarion_--the former being a portion of the priestly\r\ndress used for covering the arms, and signifying the thongs with which the\r\nhands of Christ were bound; the latter a stole worn over the left shoulder.\r\nThe head of each deacon was adorned with long waving hair, and each carried\r\na censer in his hand. They faced each other, keeping watch together over\r\nthe dead. A procession of priests, duly robed, began to move, preceded by\r\ncenser-bearers and singing men and boys.\r\n\r\nThe point whence the procession started--Mala Greuzin, situated at the\r\nextreme east end of Moscow--lay several miles away from the cemetery for\r\nwhich they were all _en route;_ and this veritably ancient Asiatic city had\r\nto be traversed at an angle in this solemn fashion, seventy or eighty\r\ncarriages following. From the beginning to the end of the prescribed route\r\nMuscovites lined the road on either side, and it is fair to add that I\r\nnever beheld more respect shown even to royalty itself. All was quietness,\r\nthe general expression of sympathy and respect being permitted to find vent\r\nonly in excessive gesticulation and genuflection. Not a head remained\r\ncovered, not a single person by whom the procession passed permitted it to\r\ndo so without crossing himself several times from forehead to chest and\r\nfrom shoulder to shoulder.\r\n\r\nAt the first church which the procession reached, the bells of which had\r\nbegun to toll--clash rather--long before it came in sight, the entire party\r\nhalted. A bell was rung by one of those in advance, and then all waited.\r\nThe priests and their various acolytes clustered reverently by the hearse,\r\nthe followers and spectators standing at a respectful distance, but\r\nnevertheless taking part in the service. After first incensing the hearse,\r\nthemselves and all around, further prayers were said and chanted: then a\r\nsignal was given and all moved on again, only, however, to again pause on\r\nthe route, for at every church we passed--and we must have encountered at\r\nleast thirty or forty, if not more, seeing that such sacred edifices rise\r\nupon one's view in Moscow at wellnigh every three or four minutes'\r\nspace--the ceremony was repeated. No sooner had one set of bells ceased to\r\nsound in our ears than another took its place, and again all halted, and\r\nthen again all marched onward. Every window as the cortége passed along was\r\nthrown open, and figures bent forward ever and anon, enacting their wonted\r\npart in the pageant. And the pageant, be it remembered, was, after all,\r\nonly one of frequent occurrence.\r\n\r\nOnly the week before I had had the privilege of watching this identical old\r\npriest baptize the child of one of the most ancient nobles here, the\r\nceremony being performed not in a church, but at the nobleman's house. One\r\ngodfather and one godmother are all that are required, the latter of whom\r\nholds the infant. On the godmother also a large share of duty devolves,\r\nthere being certain gifts which she is bound by national custom to offer\r\nfor acceptance on the occasion. Often, therefore, the duty of selecting a\r\nfemale sponsor becomes a somewhat invidious one. A handsome dress to the\r\nmother, no matter in what rank of life; a delicate lace cap to the main\r\nobject of the occasion; a lace chemise for the same highly-honored small\r\nindividual; and an elaborate silk pocket handkerchief to the officiating\r\npriest,--these, when of the best quality, and they are invariably so, mount\r\nup somewhat as regards price, seeing that everything is marvellously dear\r\nhere in the matter of dress. The godfather, standing immediately in front\r\nof the large font brought specially for the purpose from the adjacent\r\nchurch, and at the right hand of his fellow-sponsor, simply presents a\r\nsmall golden cross, to be worn, it is supposed, ever afterward. Immediately\r\nbehind the font, and facing the entire audience--for a large circle of\r\nfriends had been invited to witness the ceremony--was placed the \"holy\r\npicture\" of the household, without which in Russia no homestead, whether\r\nbelonging to rich or poor, is considered complete, and before which a\r\nlighted oil lamp ever stands burning--a \"picture of God,\" as the Russian\r\nchildren are taught from their earliest years to call it. Before this the\r\npriests bowed on entering.\r\n\r\nThe mode of baptism was immersion, after several exorcisms had been read\r\nand the priest had thrice blown in the infant's face, signing him, also\r\nthrice, on the forehead and breast. Three tall lighted candles were affixed\r\nto the font, and others were held by the god-parents, except when they\r\nmarched round the font in procession three times during \"the chrism,\" when\r\nthe candles were laid down. The chrism consists in anointing the infant's\r\nforehead, breast, shoulders and middle of the back with holy oil, after\r\nwhich comes the service, when the forehead, eyes, nostrils, mouth, ears,\r\nbreast, hands and feet are again anointed, but this time with the holy\r\nunction prepared once a year, on Monday in Holy Week, within the walls of\r\nthe Kremlin, and consecrated by the metropolitan in the cathedral of the\r\nAnnunciation on Holy Thursday. Then comes the concluding act, when the\r\npriest cuts off a small portion of the child's hair in four different\r\nplaces on the crown of the head, encloses it in a morsel of wax and throws\r\nit into the font, as a sort of first-fruits of that which has been\r\nconsecrated.\r\n\r\nS.E.\r\n\r\n\r\nA DAY AT THE PARIS CONSERVATOIRE.\r\n\r\nIt was ten o'clock in the morning when we drove up to the door of the\r\nworld-famous institution, but, early as it was, an animated throng already\r\nfilled the wide marble-paved entrance-hall--former pupils in elegant\r\nattire; girl aspirants for future honors, accompanied by the inevitable\r\nmamma with the invariable little hand-bag; young men and old; celebrated\r\ndramatists and well-known actors, visitors, critics, etc.--all passing to\r\nand fro or engaged in conversation while awaiting the hour for taking their\r\nseats. Passing through these, we ascend a narrow staircase that gives one\r\ngood hopes of a martyr's death should the theatre chance to catch fire, and\r\nwe instal ourselves in a narrow and by no means comfortable box in the\r\ndress-circle. The theatre of the Conservatoire, though not very large, is\r\nvery elegantly and artistically decorated in the Pompeian style, the stage\r\nbeing set with a single \"box scene,\" as it is technically called, which is\r\nnever changed, as plays are never acted there. Here take place the\r\nfar-famed concerts du Conservatoire, for which tickets are as hard to\r\nobtain as are invitations to the entertainments of a duchess, all the seats\r\nbeing owned by private individuals. But what we are now here to witness is\r\nthe competition in dramatic declamation, tragic and comic. The jury occupy\r\na box in the centre of the dress-circle and opposite to the stage. This\r\nterrifying tribunal is enough to try the nerves of the stoutest aspirant\r\nfor dramatic honors, comprising as it does among its members such powers in\r\nthe land as Legouvé, Camilla-Doucet, Alexandre Dumas, the directors of the\r\nComédie Française and the Odéon, and the great actors Got and Delaunay. An\r\nelderly gentleman comes forward on the stage and reads from a printed paper\r\nthe name of each competitor and those of his or her assistants, and that of\r\nthe play from which the scene that is to be represented is chosen. Each\r\npupil selects a scene, and the persons who in French technical parlance are\r\nto \"give the reply\" (_i.e._ to take the other characters in the scene) are\r\nchosen from among the ranks of the pupil's fellow-competitors. Lots are\r\ndrawn to decide the place that each one is to occupy on the programme, the\r\nfirst place and the last being considered the least desirable. Printed\r\nbills are distributed among the audience giving a list of the competitors,\r\nwith the names of the plays from which they have chosen scenes, and\r\n(horrible innovation for the lady pupils!) the age of each one as well.\r\n\r\nThe competition is opened by M. Levanz, a young man of thirty, who took a\r\nsecond prize last year, and who has chosen the closet-scene from _Hamlet_\r\n(the translation of the elder Dumas) as his _cheval de bataille_. He has a\r\nmarked Germanic countenance, decidedly the reverse of handsome, yet mobile\r\nand expressive: his voice is good, his figure tall and manly. He has\r\nevidently seen Rossi in Hamlet, and models his conception of the character\r\non that grand impersonation. Next comes M. Bregaint in a scene from\r\n_Andromaque:_ he is so bad, so _very_ bad, that the audience are moved to\r\nsudden outbursts of hilarity by his grand tragic points. He is succeeded by\r\na boy of sixteen, tall and graceful, with a fine tragic face of the heroic\r\nKemble mould, and great blue-gray eyes that dilate or contract beneath the\r\nimpulses of the moment--a born actor from head to foot. He fairly thrills\r\nthe audience in the great scene of the duke de Nemours from _Louis XI_.\r\nThis youth, M. Guitry, is undoubtedly, if his life be spared, the coming\r\ntragedian of the French stage. Then we have the first one of the lady\r\ncompetitors, Mademoiselle Edet, a tall, awkward girl of eighteen, with a\r\nflat face and Chinese-like features, dressed up in a gown of cream-yellow\r\nfoulard trimmed with wide fringe and made with a loose jacket, whereon the\r\nfringes wave wildly in the air as she flings her arms around in the tragic\r\nlove-making of Phèdre. Two or three others of moderate merit succeed, and\r\nthen comes Mademoiselle Jullien, who gives the great scene of Roxane in\r\n_Bajazet_ with so much intelligence of intonation and grace of gesture that\r\nthe audience are moved to sudden applause. She is rather too short and of\r\ntoo delicate a physique for tragedy, but her face is expressive, her eyes\r\nfine, and there are intellect and talent in every tone and movement. She is\r\nnearly twenty-nine years of age, so has not much time to waste if she is to\r\nmake her mark in her profession. Last on the list of tragic aspirants comes\r\na gentleman of thirty-one, M. Aubert, who goes through a scene from\r\n_Hamlet_ in a very tolerable manner. He was in the army, was doing well and\r\nwas rising in grade when, seized by the theatrical mania, he relinquished\r\nhis profession and turned his attention to the stage. Thus far, he has\r\nproved, practically speaking, a failure: he has won no prizes, and no\r\nmanager will engage him. This is his last chance, as his age will prevent\r\nhim, by the rules of the Conservatoire, from taking part in any future\r\ncompetition.\r\n\r\nThe tragedy concours ended, a recess of an hour is proclaimed, and there is\r\na rush to the refreshment-tables and a great consumption of sandwiches and\r\ncakes, of coffee and water (known as \"mazagran\") and of _vin ordinaire_.\r\nUnder that vestibule pass and repass the literary luminaries of modern\r\nFrance. Here is Henri de Bornier, the author of _La Fille de Roland_, a\r\nquiet, earnest-looking gentleman, with clear luminous eyes and the smallest\r\nhands imaginable. Here comes Francisque Sarcey, the greatest dramatic\r\ncritic of France and one of the most noted of her Republican journalists,\r\nbroad-shouldered, black-eyed and stalwart-looking. Yonder stand a group of\r\nAcademicians--Legouvé, Doucet, Dumas--in earnest conversation with Édouard\r\nThierry, the librarian of the Arsénal. The handsome, delicate,\r\naristocratic-looking gentleman who joins the group is M. Perrin, the\r\ndirector of the Comédie Française, the most accomplished and intelligent\r\ntheatrical manager in France. There is an elderly, reserved-looking\r\ngentleman beside him who looks like a solemn _savant_ out on a holiday. It\r\ntakes more than one glance for us to recognize in him the most accomplished\r\nlight comedian of our day, that embodiment of grace, vivacity, sparkling\r\nwit and unfading youth, who is known to the boards of the Comédie Française\r\nby the name of Delaunay. There are other minor luminaries, too numerous to\r\nmention.\r\n\r\nWe go up stairs and resume our seats, and the competition of comedy is\r\nbegun. Scene succeeds to scene and competitor to competitor: the day wears\r\non, and flitting clouds from time to time obscure the dome, bringing out\r\nthe glare of the footlights that have been burning all day in a singularly\r\neffective manner. Of the nineteen competitors, the deepest impression is\r\nmade by M. Barral, who plays a scene from _L'Avare_ magnificently; by\r\nMademoiselle Carrière, who reveals herself as a sparkling and intelligent\r\nsoubrette; and by Mademoiselle Sisos, a genuine _comédienne_, only sixteen\r\nyears of age and as pretty as a peach. It is six o'clock when the last\r\ncompetitor has said his say, and then the jury retire to deliberate\r\nrespecting the awards. What a flutter there must be among the young things\r\nwhose future destiny is now swaying in the balance, for success means\r\nfortune, and failure a disheartening postponement, and to the elder ones\r\ndownright and disastrous ruin of all their hopes! Half an hour passes, and\r\nthen, after what seems a weary period of suspense, the box-door is thrown\r\nopen and the jury resume their seats. Ambroise Thomas, the president of the\r\nConservatoire, strikes his bell and a dead silence ensues. In a full\r\nsonorous voice he begins: \"Concours of tragedy, men's class. No\r\nprizes.--Usher, summon M. Guitry.\" The gifted boy comes forward to the\r\nfootlights. \"M. Guitry, the jury have awarded to you a _premier accessit_.\"\r\nHe bows and retires amid the hearty applause of the audience. \"Women's\r\nclass.--Usher, call Mademoiselle Jullien.\" She comes out pale and agitated,\r\nthe slight form quivering like a wind-swept flower in her robes of creamy\r\ncashmere. Is it the Odéon that awaits her--the second prize? for in her\r\nmodesty she had only hoped for a _premier accessit._ \"Mademoiselle Jullien,\r\nthe jury have awarded to you the first prize.\" The first prize! Those words\r\nmean to her an assured career, a brilliant future, the doors of the Comédie\r\nFrançaise flung wide open to receive her. She falters, trembles, bows\r\nprofoundly, and goes off in a very passion of hysterical weeping. Then come\r\nthe comedy awards. M. Barral gets a first prize, as is his just due, as\r\ndoes also Mademoiselle Carrière. \"Usher, call Mademoiselle Sisos.\" She\r\ncomes forward, her great brown eyes dilated with excitement, her cheeks\r\nburning like two red roses, a mass of faded white roses clinging amid the\r\nrumpled gold of her hair--a very bewitching picture of childish grace and\r\nbeauty. \"Mademoiselle Sisos, the jury have awarded to you a second prize.\"\r\nShe laughs and blushes, and brings her hands together with a childlike\r\ngesture of delight. \"Oh, merci!\" she cries, and drops a courtesy, and then\r\naway she goes--happy little creature, thus consecrated artiste at sixteen!\r\nThe other awards are given, the jury leave their box, and the audience\r\ndisperse. The friends of the competitors crowd around the stage-door, and\r\neach of the successful ones is seized by the hand and congratulated and\r\nembraced, the youthful Guitry being especially surrounded. Two or three\r\nmore years of study will land this gifted boy on the boards of the Comédie\r\nFrançaise. The queen of the day, Mademoiselle Jullien, has stolen away\r\novercome by excess of emotion, which, though joyful, is still exhausting to\r\nher delicate frame. Finally, everybody retires, the doors are closed, and\r\nthe long, exciting _séance_ has come to an end at last.\r\n\r\nL.H.H.\r\n\r\n\r\nBRIGHAM YOUNG AND MORMONISM.\r\n\r\nBrigham Young's career is a valuable commentary on that of Mohammed, and\r\nwill hereafter be a standard citation with explorers of the natural history\r\nof religions. It might be more proper to go back of Young, and adhere to\r\nJoe Smith as the figure-head of the Mormon dispensation. How Smith would\r\nhave turned out had he lived, and whether he would have made as much of\r\nUtah as the man upon whose shoulders his mantle fell, is not easy to say;\r\nbut his was a less robust character, the enthusiast in him too far\r\nobscuring the organizer and commander. The Church is the thing to look at,\r\nrather than its leaders, when we consider duration--the soil rather than\r\nthe plough. Why has Mohammed's creation lasted longer and spread wider than\r\nthat of Charlemagne or Tamerlane? And is Smith's to have the like fortune,\r\nor to die out like those of Münster and Joanna Southcote?\r\n\r\nThe Mormon \"revelation\" has been before the world more than forty years. In\r\ntwenty-two years from his first vision Mohammed had reduced all Arabia\r\nunder his religious and political sway. Young's dominions have not expanded\r\nterritorially. His faith cannot be said to exist outside of Utah. His\r\nconverts are compelled to go thither for the exercise of their religion.\r\nSalt Lake City is not a Mecca, the goal of a passing pilgrimage, but the\r\none and only possible abiding-place of those who profess its creed. A\r\nsystem thus localized is in danger of being stifled. Especially is this the\r\ncase when its seat is exposed to invasion by a swelling current of\r\nnon-sympathizers or open enemies. These may be repelled or prevented from\r\nimproving their foothold by the firmness, unity and numerical predominance\r\nof the invaded. So it has happened at Salt Lake. The Mormons hold all the\r\nserviceable soil, and it is difficult for the \"Gentiles\" to effect a\r\nlodgment. Until they do, they must occupy, even in their own eyes, somewhat\r\nthe position of adventurers. They cannot hope to secure the respect of the\r\nindustrious sectaries who own and till the soil, and who are taught to\r\ncount them aliens and persecutors. Irrigation is here the only means of\r\nsuccessful agriculture. It involves great outlay of capital and labor, and\r\ncreates great fixedness of tenure. Newcomers are thus additionally\r\ndiscouraged.\r\n\r\nThus entrenched in a well-provisioned citadel, welcoming all the new levies\r\nit can win, and amply able to provide for them, Mormonism bids fair to\r\nmake a prolonged stand. To emerge from a defensive position and strike for\r\nunlimited sway is what it cannot, to judge by all precedents, expect. It\r\nwill be compelled, in fact, to lighten itself of some dead weights in order\r\nto maintain its actual situation. Polygamy must go, and the absolute power\r\nof the priesthood be modified. With some such adaptations it may continue a\r\nreality for generations to come. And time is a great sanctifier. A creed\r\nthat lives for one or two centuries is by so much the more likely to live\r\nlonger. Youth is the critical period with religions, as with animals and\r\nplants and nations. Through that period Mormonism is passing with\r\nflattering success. That such a lusty juvenile will, by favor of the\r\nmellowing effect imposed on all creeds by early years of toil, trouble and\r\nexperience, reach a middle age of presentable decency, is not a more\r\nunlikely supposition than the worthy Vermont clergyman would have\r\npronounced, half a century ago, the idea that his _jeu d'esprit_ would\r\nbecome the Bible of sixty thousand industrious, well-ordered\r\nEnglish-speaking people in the heart of the American continent.\r\n\r\nE.C.B.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EDUCATION OF WOMEN IN INDIA.\r\n\r\nAccording to a report sent to our Commissioner of Education at Washington\r\nfour years ago, there were then in India one thousand girls' schools\r\nsupported by the government and some five hundred missionary schools\r\ndevoted to female education. Besides these, there has sprung up during the\r\nlast few years a new field for the women-educators in that country. This is\r\nthe teaching of women in their homes. It is called _zenana-work._ The\r\n_zenana_ is the women's apartment in the house--the _harem_ of the Turks.\r\nWomen have been sent from England and from America for this special object,\r\nand their labors are meeting with encouraging success. They are constantly\r\ngaining admission to new families, which from caste or other causes are\r\nopposed to sending their young women to the regular schools. Some of the\r\nzenana-teachers are regularly-educated physicians.\r\n\r\nFor the government schools each province has a director of public\r\ninstruction, with inspectors of divisions and subdivisions. These directors\r\nare \"gentlemen of high qualification and well paid.\" It is a notable fact\r\nthat in one of the provinces the office of director is filled by a\r\nChristian woman--a foreigner no doubt, though the report does not say.\r\n\r\nAt Dehra, at the foot of the Himalaya Mountains, there is a high school for\r\ngirls organized on the plan of the Mount Holyoke Seminary. Here English is\r\nspoken, and the pupils are carried through a course of training that may\r\njustly be termed _high_. One of the pupils of this school has lately been\r\nappointed by the government to go to England and qualify herself as a\r\nphysician, under a contract to return and serve the government by taking\r\ncharge of a hospital and college for training young women as midwives and\r\nnurses.\r\n\r\nOf course, in a country containing a population of over one hundred and\r\nfifty-one millions, one thousand public schools for girls, supplemented as\r\nthese are by missionary schools of many denominations, are inadequate to\r\nmeet the needs of the people. There is an increasing demand in all the\r\nprovinces for schools and colleges; and the native young men especially are\r\neagerly seeking the educational advantages of the colleges and\r\nuniversities, because they know that these are a sure road to preferment.\r\n\"The government takes care to give employment to those who wish it.\"\r\n\r\nThe difficulties in the way of female education in India are well expressed\r\nin a late letter from one of the most distinguished native reformers, Baboo\r\nKeshub Chunder Sen of Calcutta. \"No words of mine,\" he says, \"would convey\r\nto you an adequate idea of the great obstacles which the social and\r\nreligious condition of the Hindoo community presents in the way of female\r\neducation and advancement. In a country where superstition and caste\r\nprejudices prevail to an alarming extent, where widows are cruelly\r\npersecuted and prevented from remarrying, where high-caste Hindoos are\r\nallowed to marry as many wives as they like without undertaking the\r\nresponsibility of protecting them, and where little girls marry at a most\r\ntender age and sacrifice all prospects of healthy physical and mental\r\ndevelopment, it will take centuries before any solid and extensive reform\r\nis achieved.\"\r\n\r\nUntil recently, scarcely one woman in ten thousand learned to read or\r\nacquired any of the accomplishments common to women of Christian countries.\r\nOccasionally, women of vicious lives in cities, having leisure, became\r\nquite learned, and this made learning a shame for women of irreproachable\r\nreputation. Moreover, Hindoo husbands declared, and believed, that if you\r\ntaught a woman to read she would be sure in time to have illicit relations\r\nwith some one. Ignorance was innocence, the safeguard of both rank and\r\nchastity.\r\n\r\nThe missionaries, who were the first to attempt the amelioration of the\r\npeople, had to commence with the lowest castes or classes, those having\r\nnothing to lose; and even then the teachers had to pay the girls a small\r\ncopper coin daily for attending school. Even the government schools in some\r\nplaces pay the girls for attending, but they are much more popular than the\r\nmissionary schools, because, according to the Rev. Joseph Warren in the\r\nreport mentioned, the parents are not afraid that their girls will become\r\nChristians by attending them; and he adds that the government teachers and\r\nbooks are \"all positively heathen or quite destitute of all religion.\" In\r\nsome parts of the country the government schools secure the attendance of\r\nhigh-caste girls by allowing them to be placed behind a curtain, and thus\r\nscreened from the eyes of the male teacher or inspector, as all the women\r\nof such classes are screened from male visitors. Even the physician sees\r\nonly a hand protruded from under a curtain, and by the touch of this, with\r\na few unsatisfactory answers to his questions, he is supposed to be able to\r\nknow what the malady is, and how to prescribe for it.\r\n\r\nM.H.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLITERATURE OF THE DAY.\r\n\r\n\r\nBirds and Poets: with other Papers. By John Burroughs. New York: Hurd &\r\nHoughton.\r\n\r\nA duodecimo that discourses on equal terms of Emerson and the chickadee,\r\nand unites Carlyle and the author's cow with a cement or filling-in\r\nindescribable in variety and in the comminution of materials, need not be\r\nheld to strict account in the matter of neatness or accuracy of title. The\r\nclosing article, headed \"The Flight of the Eagle,\" is the most remarkable\r\nof the collection. Who would suspect, under such a heading, an elaborate\r\neulogy of Walt Whitman? The writer is obviously more at home among the\r\nsong-birds than among the Raptores, unless he be the discoverer of some new\r\nspecies of eagle characterized by traits very unlike those of other members\r\nof the genus. It were to be wished that he had left out the disquisition on\r\nWhitman, for it is a jarring chord in his little orchestra of lyric and\r\nornithologic song. He might have kept it by him till the longer growing of\r\nhis critical beard, and then, if still a devotee at that singular shrine,\r\nhave expanded it into a volume or two explanatory of the imagination,\r\nanimus and metre of his favorite bard.\r\n\r\nThe feathered warblers have always been popular with the featherless, who\r\nare indebted to them for no end of similes and suggestions. What would\r\npoetry be without the skylark, the nightingale, the dove and the eagle? It\r\nis far yet from having exhausted them. It cannot be said to have approached\r\nthem in the right way--on the most eloquent and interesting side. It\r\nforgets that each species of bird stands by itself, and has its special\r\nlife and history as truly as man. We counted thirty-nine kinds in a grove\r\nthe centre whereof was our delightful abode for two-thirds of the past\r\nsummer, each endowed with its separate outfit of language, ways and means\r\nof living, tastes and political and social notions. In each, moreover,\r\nindividualism showed itself--if not to our apprehension as articulately,\r\nyet as indubitably, as among the race which considers them to have been all\r\ncreated for its amusement and advantage. It does not take long, superficial\r\nas is our acquaintance with their vernacular and the workings of their\r\nlittle brains, to single out particular specimens, and perceive that no two\r\n\"birds of a feather\" are exactly alike. A particular robin will rule the\r\nroost, and assert successfully for his mate the choice of resting-places\r\nabove competing redbreasts. It is a particular catbird, identified, it may\r\nbe, by a missing feather in his tail, that heads the foray on our\r\nstrawberries and cherries. We recognize afar off either of the pair of\r\n\"flickers,\" or yellow-shafted woodpeckers, which have set up their penates\r\nin the heart of the left-hand garden gatepost. The wren whose modest\r\ntabernacle occupies the top of the porch pilaster we have little difficulty\r\nin \"spotting\" when we meet her in a joint stroll along the lawn-fence. Her\r\nways are not as the ways of other wrens. She has a somewhat different style\r\nof diving into the ivy and exploring the syringa. A new generation of doves\r\nhas grown up since the lilacs were in bloom, and nothing is easier than to\r\ndistinguish the old and young of the two or three separate families till\r\nall leave the grass and the gravel together and hie to the stubble-fields\r\nbeyond our ken. Of the one mocking bird who made night hideous by his\r\nmasterly imitations of the screaking of a wheel-barrow (regreased at an\r\nearly period in self-defence) and the wheezy bark of Beppo, the\r\nsuperannuated St. Bernard, there could of course be no doubt. There was\r\nnone of his kind to compare him with--not even a mate, for \"sexual\r\nselection\" could not possibly operate in face of so inharmonious a\r\nlove-song. His isolation had its parallel in the one white guinea-fowl that\r\nhaunted the shrubbery like a ghost, much more silent and placid than it\r\nwould have been in society, and its antitype in the hennery, where\r\nindividuality of course ran riot among the Brahmas, Dominicas and\r\nHamburgs--hens that would and would not lay, that would and would not set,\r\nthat would and would not scratch up seeds, and presented generally as great\r\na variety of vagaries as of feathers. So, when we turned our back at last\r\non lovely Boscobel, itself shut out, as the common phrase goes, \"from the\r\nworld\" by serried ramparts of maple, elm, acacia and catalpa, we knew well\r\nthat that enceinte of leafage enclosed many little worlds of its\r\nown--winged microcosms, epicycles of the grand cycle of dateless life which\r\nman in his humility assumes to be merely a subsidiary appendage of his own\r\norbit.\r\n\r\nBirds should be studied seriously. The naturalists will tell us more about\r\nthem, and interest us more, than the poets. Mr. Bryant makes fun of the\r\nbobolink, and turns into an aimless whistle the solemn oration on domestic\r\nmatters uttered by that small but energetic American to his mate. The\r\nwaterfowl he treats more gravely and respectfully, but he still makes it\r\nonly a part of the landscape and the theme, without ascribing any\r\nintelligent purpose to its flight. The bird, proceeding steadily and calmly\r\nto its business, may well have confounded its versifier with his fellow the\r\nfowler, and looked upon him, too, as regretting only that it was out of\r\ngunshot. Audubon or Wilson would have noted more sensibly the floating\r\nfigure, far above \"falling dew,\" and the earth-bound mortal who was\r\nevidently afraid of rheumatics and calculating whether he could walk home\r\nbefore dark. The bird, they would have been perfectly aware, was neither\r\n\"wandering\" nor \"lost,\" and no more in need of the special interposition of\r\na protecting Providence than they or Mr. Bryant. They would infer its\r\nmotives, its point of departure and its destination, the character of the\r\nfriends it left behind or sought--whether it was carrying out a plan of\r\nthe day or bound on an expedition covering half the year. Its species would\r\nhave been plain to them at half a glance, and its scientific name would\r\nhave replaced the vague designation of \"waterfowl.\" Its life, habits and\r\nhabitat winter and summer, would have unrolled before them, and the\r\ndogs-eared and rain-stained note-book sprung open for a new entry. The\r\npoet, on the other hand, got happily home without injury to his health (for\r\nhe is still hale half a century after the fact), lit the gas, nibbed the\r\nquill pen of the day, and sent down to us what must be confessed a\r\npleasanter memorandum than we should have had from the forest-students.\r\nThese, brave and ardent fellows! have long been asleep beneath the birds.\r\n\r\nMr. Burroughs is half poet, half naturalist in his way of looking at\r\nNature, and steers clear of the poetic vagueness in regard to species. A\r\npassing description of the brown thrush as \"skulking\" among the bushes hits\r\nthat bird to the life. Some remarks on page 119 would seem to be applied by\r\na slip of the pen to the crow blackbird, instead of the cowbird, which has\r\nalways enjoyed the distinction of being the only American species that\r\ndisposes of its offspring after the fashion of the cuckoo and Jean Jacques\r\nRousseau. The chapter on Emerson contains some acute remarks, but the\r\nwarmest tribute to Emerson is the book itself, in which that writer's\r\ninfluence is everywhere patent both in style and thought. Mr. Burroughs has\r\na happy facility of expression, and could well afford by this time to\r\ndiscard the Emersonian props and stand on his own merits.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Life of Edgar Allan Poe. By W.F. Gill. Illustrated. New York:\r\nDillingham.\r\n\r\nGriswold's memoir of Poe has been actually beneficial to the reputation of\r\nits subject, contrary to its obvious design. It has caused a thorough\r\nsifting of all accessible records of the poet's short and dreary life, and\r\nelicited many reminiscences from men of mark who were in one way or another\r\npersonally associated with him. We know now, more certainly than we might\r\nhave done but for Griswold's effort to prove the opposite, that Poe was not\r\nexpelled in disgrace from the University of Virginia, but bore himself well\r\nthere as a student and a man; that he deliberately went to work and\r\nprocured his being dropped from the rolls of West Point by building up with\r\nvenial faults the requisite sum of \"demerits,\" after having repeatedly and\r\nin vain sought permission to withdraw from the control of a system of\r\ndiscipline so unsuited to his temperament; that, so far from being\r\nintemperate, a single glass of wine sufficed to bring on something like\r\ninsanity; that, instead of neglecting his family, he devoted himself to\r\nthem with a very rare exclusiveness, and wore down his health by watching\r\nat the bedside of his sick wife; that he was as faithful to his business as\r\nto his domestic obligations; and that, wholly disqualified for battling\r\nwith the world, he managed to keep his necessarily troubled life at least\r\nunstained. We know, moreover, that he did not appoint Griswold his\r\nliterary executor, and that the document used by the latter as a means of\r\nderiving from that assumed office an opportunity of vindictive defamation\r\nwas drawn up after the poet's death by Griswold himself. To the controversy\r\nthus excited we are indebted for the illumination of one or two poems\r\nrelinquished by the critics as hopelessly, if not intentionally, obscure.\r\n_Ulalume_, for example, held by some to be a mere experiment on the\r\njingling capacity of words and the taste of readers for grappling with\r\ninsoluble puzzles, is pronounced by one familiar with his most intimate\r\nfeelings at the time of its composition a sublimated but distinct reflex of\r\nthem and of the circumstances which gave them color.\r\n\r\nCould Poe's pen have cleared itself from the morbid influences which fixed\r\nit in a peculiar path, we might have missed some of his finest and most\r\nsubtle poems and some prose efforts which we could better spare. But his\r\nwonderful powers of analysis would have been serviceable upon a broader and\r\nmore practical field. He had an insight into the laws of language and of\r\nrhythm equalled by no one else in our day. What is most mysterious in the\r\nforms and relations of matter had a special charm for him. None could trace\r\nit more acutely; and his powers, matured by more and healthier years and\r\napplied in their favorite direction, were quite equal to results like those\r\nattained by his predecessor Goethe, the savant of poets. He died a few\r\nyears older than Burns and Byron, but more of a boy than either. The man\r\nPoe we never saw. The best of him was to come, and it never came. Poe had,\r\nhowever, what he is not always credited with--the sincerity and earnestness\r\nof maturity. He was anything but a mere propounder of riddles. Had he lived\r\nto our day, his office would have been to aid science, so wonderfully\r\nadvanced in the intervening third of a century, in solving some of its own.\r\nAnd in addition to that possible work we should have been none the poorer\r\nin the treasures of poetry he actually gave us.\r\n\r\n\r\nOlivia Raleigh. By W.W. Follett Synge. Philadelphia: J.B. Lippincott & Co.\r\n\r\nIn the few choice words of introduction to the American reprint Mrs. Annis\r\nLee Wister admirably characterizes this charming novel. It is indeed like a\r\n\"clear, pure breath of English air:\" from the first page to the last it is\r\nredolent of the health of an \"incense-breathing morn.\" There are no dark\r\nscenes here, leaving on the reader a feeling of degradation that such\r\nthings can be--no impossible villain weaving a web of intricate or\r\npurposeless villainy--but all is fresh and genuine, and we close the volume\r\nwith a sense of gratitude that such a story is possible.\r\n\r\nEven if this be not in itself a recommendation sufficient to enlist the\r\ninterest of novel-readers, _Olivia Raleigh_ is something more: it is a work\r\nof art: there is in it nothing crude or hasty or ill-digested. Around the\r\nfour or five prominent characters all the interest centres, and the\r\nattention is not distracted by any wearisome episodes that have nothing to\r\ndo with the main story. The characters are admirably thought out, and\r\nreveal themselves more by their actions than by any microscopical analysis\r\nof motives. They pass before us like veritable human beings, and what they\r\nare we learn from what they do. The transformation of one of the characters\r\nfrom a gay, debonnair bachelor past middle age into a penurious miser of\r\nthe Blueberry-Jones type is bold, and in less skilful hands would be a\r\nblemish, but Mr. Synge has amply justified it, and admirably uses it to\r\ncement the structure of his plot. There is no weakness in any chapter, and\r\nas we read so secure do we feel in the author's strength that, had he\r\nchosen to end the story in sorrow and not in joy, we should submit as\r\nthough to an inflexible decree of Fate.\r\n\r\n\r\nLes Koumiassine. Par Henry Gréville. Paris: Plon.\r\n\r\nIt is always interesting to watch the course of French fiction, because\r\nwhile the novel is in all countries at the present time the favorite form\r\nof expression of those writers who eschew scientific work on the one side\r\nand stand aloof from poetry on the other, in France, which is noticeably\r\nthe country where theories are put into practice as well as invented, all\r\nsorts of literary methods have their clever defenders, who furnish examples\r\nof what they preach. Since Balzac and George Sand died, the post of leading\r\nnovelist has been vacant, although there has been no lack of writers of the\r\nsecond or third, and especially of still lower, rank. Octave Feuillet still\r\nproduces occasionally a clever piece of workmanship; Cherbuliez at\r\nintervals writes a novel which proves how lamentable a thing is the\r\npossession of brilliancy alone apart from the seriousness of character, or\r\nof some sides of character, which must exist alongside of even high\r\nintellectual qualities in order that the man may make a lasting impression\r\non his time. Great gifts frittered away on meaningless trifles are as\r\ndisappointing as possible, and are the more disappointing in proportion to\r\nthe greatness of the gifts; so that the decadence of Cherbuliez--or, if\r\nthis is too severe, his lack of improvement after his brilliant\r\nbeginning--is a very melancholy thing. Zola is among the younger men, the\r\nhead of a number of enthusiasts who revel in the exact study of social\r\nordure, and who threaten to destroy fiction by ridding it of what makes its\r\nlife--imagination, that is--and substituting for it scientific fact.\r\nTheuriet is an amiable but by no means a powerful writer, who so far has\r\ncontented himself with following different models without striking out any\r\nspecial path of his own.\r\n\r\nHenry Gréville is a new author, who has reached by no means the highest,\r\nyet a very respectable, place--such as would be a source of gratification\r\nto most people. The name signed to her novels is the _nom-de-plume_ of a\r\nlady who, as is also apparent from her work, has lived long enough in\r\nRussia to become familiar with the people and their ways. _Les Koumiassine_\r\nis a story of Russian life, treating of a rich family whose name gives the\r\ntitle to the novel. The family is one of great wealth, and consists of the\r\nCount Koumiassine and his wife, their two children--one a boy of nine or\r\nten, the other a girl half a dozen years older--and a niece of about\r\nseventeen. The plot concerns itself with the efforts of the countess to\r\ngive her niece, whom she values much less than her daughter, a suitable\r\nhusband. The poor girl is bullied and badgered after the most approved\r\nmethods of domestic tyranny, and her high-spirited struggle against adverse\r\ncircumstances makes the book as readable as one could wish. After all, the\r\nfamily is a microcosm, and furnishes frequent opportunity for the practice\r\nof good or bad qualities; and the cleverest novel-writers have chosen just\r\nthis subject which seems so bald to the romantic writer. The contest in\r\nthis case is a long one, and is hotly contested, and the imperiousness of\r\nthe countess and the graceful courage of the girl are excellently well\r\ndescribed. The other characters too are clearly put before the reader, so\r\nthat those who exercise care in their choice of French novels may take up\r\nthis one with the certainty that they will be entertained, and, what is\r\nrarer, innocently entertained. For in a large pile of French novels it\r\nwould be hard to find so pretty a story so well told as is the intimacy\r\nbetween the two young girls, the cousins, who in their different ways\r\ncircumvent Fate in the person of the countess. Their amiability and jollity\r\nand loyalty to each other give the book an air of attractive truthfulness\r\nand refinement which well replaces the priggishness generally to be found\r\nin innocuous French fiction. More than this, the plot is intelligently\r\nhandled, and no person is introduced who is not carefully studied. In this\r\nrespect of careful execution the author resembles Tourgueneff, whose friend\r\nand disciple she is. Like him, and like those who have been affected by his\r\ninfluence, she gives attention to the minor characters and comparatively\r\ninsignificant incidents, so that the book makes a really lifelike\r\nimpression. This is not a story of great passion, but it deals very\r\ncleverly with the less open waters of domestic strife. While what it shows\r\nof human nature in general is the most important thing, what is shown of\r\nRussian life is of great interest. The position of the countess, and the\r\nhabit of her mind with its over-bearing self-will and ingenious\r\nself-approval, are studies possible, of course, anywhere, but pretty sure\r\nto be found especially in a land like Russia, where the habit of command\r\nwas until recently so strongly fostered by the existence of serfdom. The\r\ncondition of those who are exposed to this aggressive imperiousness is\r\nclearly illustrated in the numerous dependants who make their appearance in\r\nthis story. But it is the countess who is the best drawn and most\r\nimpressive personage. She is really lifelike, and yet not a commonplace\r\nfigure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Books Received_.\r\n\r\nDisease of the Mind: Notes on the Early Management, European and American\r\nProgress, Modern Methods, etc., in the Treatment of Insanity, with especial\r\nreference to the needs of Massachusetts and the United States.
