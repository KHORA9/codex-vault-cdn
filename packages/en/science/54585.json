S. civilian space program—the\r\njourney of the Mariner spacecraft to the vicinity of Venus and beyond.\r\nIt reports upon the measurements taken during the “flyby” on December\r\n14, 1962, when Mariner reached a point 21,598 miles from the planet, and\r\n36,000,000 miles from Earth (communication with the spacecraft was\r\ncontinued up to a distance of approximately 54,000,000 miles from\r\nEarth). The Mariner mission was a project of the National Aeronautics\r\nand Space Administration, carried out under Contract No. NAS 7-100 by\r\nthe Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOREWORD\r\n\r\nFor many centuries scientific information about the planets and the vast\r\nvoid that separates them has been collected by astronomers observing\r\nfrom the surface of the Earth. Now, with the flight of Mariner II, we\r\nsuddenly have in our hands some 90 million bits of experimental data\r\nmeasured in the region between Earth and the planet Venus. Thus, man for\r\nthe first time has succeeded in sending his instruments far into the\r\ndepths of space, and indeed, in placing them near another planet. A\r\nwhole new area of experimental astronomy has been opened up.\r\n\r\nThis book is a brief record of the Mariner Project to date and is\r\ndesigned to explain in general terms the preliminary conclusions.\r\nActually, it will be months or years before all of the data from Mariner\r\nII have been completely analyzed. The most important data were the\r\nmeasurements made in the vicinity of the planet Venus, but it should\r\nalso be noted that many weeks of interplanetary environmental\r\nmeasurements have given us new insight into some of the basic physical\r\nphenomena of the solar system. The trajectory data have provided new,\r\nmore accurate measurements of the solar system. The engineering\r\nmeasurements of the performance of the spacecraft will be of inestimable\r\nvalue in the design of future spacecraft. Thus, the Mariner II\r\nspacecraft to Venus not only looks at Venus but gives space scientists\r\nand engineers information helpful in a wide variety of space ventures.\r\n\r\nA project such as Mariner II is first a vast engineering task. Many\r\nthousands of man-hours are required to design the complex automatic\r\nequipment which must operate perfectly in the harsh environment of\r\nspace. Every detail of the system must be studied and analyzed. The\r\noperations required to carry out the mission must be understood and\r\nperformed with precision. A successful mission requires every member of\r\nthe entire project team to do his task perfectly. Whether it be the\r\nerror of a designer, mechanic, mathematician, technician, operator, or\r\ntest engineer—a single mistake, or a faulty piece of workmanship, may\r\ncause the failure of the mission. Space projects abound with examples of\r\nthe old saying, “For want of a nail, the shoe was lost ...,” and so on,\r\nuntil the kingdom is lost. Only when every member of the project team is\r\nconscious of his responsibility will space projects consistently\r\nsucceed.\r\n\r\nThe Mariner II Project started with the Lunar and Planetary Projects\r\nOffice of the Office of Space Sciences at NASA in Washington. Jet\r\nPropulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, personnel\r\nprovided the main body of the team effort. They were heavily supported\r\nby industrial contractors building many of the subassemblies of the\r\nspacecraft, by scientists planning and designing the scientific\r\nexperiments, and by the Air Force which supplied the launching rockets.\r\nSeveral thousand men and women had some direct part in the Mariner\r\nProject. It would be impossible to list all of those who made some\r\nspecial contribution, but each and every member of the project performed\r\nhis job accurately, on time, and to the highest standards.\r\n\r\nMariner II is only a prelude to NASA’s program of unmanned missions to\r\nthe planets. Missions to Mars as well as Venus will be carried out.\r\nSpacecraft will not only fly by the planets as did Mariner II, but\r\ncapsules will be landed, and spacecraft will be put into orbit about the\r\nplanets. The next mission in the Mariner series will be a flyby of the\r\nplanet Mars in 1965.\r\n\r\nBy the end of the decade, where will we be exploring, what will new\r\nMariners have found? Will there be life on Mars, or on any other planet\r\nof the solar system? What causes the red spot on Jupiter? What is at the\r\nheart of a comet? These and many other questions await answers obtained\r\nby our future spacecraft. Mariner II is just a beginning.\r\n\r\n  W. H.

Special acknowledgment is made to\r\nMr. Harold J. Wheelock who, on an extremely short time scale, carried\r\nthe major portion of this work to completion.\r\n\r\nAlthough the prime sources for the information were the Planetary\r\nProgram office and the Technical Divisions of the Jet Propulsion\r\nLaboratory, other organizations were extremely helpful in providing\r\nnecessary data, notably the George C. Marshall Space Flight Center, the\r\nLockheed Missiles and Space Company, the Astronautics Division of the\r\nGeneral Dynamics Corporation, and, of course, the many elements of the\r\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration.\r\n\r\nJPL technical information staff members who assisted Mr. Wheelock in\r\nproduction of the manuscript and its illustrations were Mr. James H.\r\nWilson, Mr. Arthur D. Beeman and Mr. Albert E. Tyler. JPL is also\r\ngrateful to Mr. Chester H. Johnson for his help and suggestions in\r\npreparing the final manuscript.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER 1\r\n                                 VENUS\r\n\r\n\r\nHalfway between Los Angeles and Las Vegas, the California country climbs\r\nsouthward out of the sunken basin of Death Valley onto the\r\n3500-foot-high floor of the Mojave desert.\r\n\r\nOn this immense plateau in an area near Goldstone Dry Lake, about 45\r\nmiles north of the town of Barstow, a group of 85-foot antennas forms\r\nthe nucleus of the United States’ world-wide, deep-space tracking\r\nnetwork.\r\n\r\nHere, on the morning of December 14, 1962, several men were gathered in\r\nthe control building beneath one of the antennas, listening intently to\r\nthe static coming from a loudspeaker. They were surrounded by the exotic\r\nequipment of the space age. Through the window loomed the gleaming metal\r\nframework of an antenna.\r\n\r\nSuddenly a voice boomed from the loudspeaker: “The numbers are changing.\r\nWe’re getting data!”\r\n\r\nThe men broke into a cheer, followed by an expectant silence.\r\n\r\nAgain the voice came from the speaker: “The spacecraft’s crossing the\r\nterminator ... it’s still scanning.”\r\n\r\nAt that moment, some 36 million miles from the Earth, the National\r\nAeronautics and Space Administration’s Mariner[1] spacecraft was passing\r\nwithin 21,600 miles of the planet Venus and was radioing back\r\ninformation to the Goldstone Station—the first scientific data ever\r\nreceived by man from the near-vicinity of another planet.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, in Washington, D.C., a press conference was in\r\nprogress. Mr. James E. Webb, Administrator of the National Aeronautics\r\nand Space Administration, and Dr. William H. Pickering, Director of the\r\nJet Propulsion Laboratory, stood before a bank of microphones. In a few\r\nmoments, Dr. Pickering said, the audience would hear the sound of\r\nMariner II as it transmitted its findings back to the Earth.\r\n\r\nThen, a musical warble, the voice of Mariner II, resounded in the hall\r\nand in millions of radios and television sets around the nation.\r\nAlluding to the Greek belief that harmonious sounds accompanied the\r\nmovement of the planets, Dr. Pickering remarked that this, in truth, was\r\nthe music of the spheres.\r\n\r\nMariner II had been launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida, on August 27,\r\n1962. Its arrival at Venus was the culmination of a 109-day journey\r\nthrough the strange environment of interplanetary space. The project had\r\ngone from the drawing board to the launching pad in less than 11 months.\r\nMariner had taxed the resources and the manpower of the Jet Propulsion\r\nLaboratory, California Institute of Technology; the Atlantic Missile\r\nRange centering at Cape Canaveral; theoretical and experimental\r\nlaboratories at several universities and NASA centers; numerous elements\r\nof the aerospace industry; and, of course, NASA management itself.\r\n\r\nTo the considerable body of engineers scattered around the world from\r\nPasadena to Goldstone to South Africa to Australia, the warble of\r\nMariner was something more than “the music of the spheres.” Intercept\r\nwith Venus was the climax of 109 days of hope and anxiety.\r\n\r\nTo the world at large, this warbling tone was a signal that the United\r\nStates had moved ahead—reached out to the planets. Mariner was exploring\r\nthe future, seeking answers to some of the unsolved questions about the\r\nsolar system.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DOUBLE STAR OF THE ANCIENT WORLD\r\n\r\nVenus, the glittering beacon of our solar system, has intrigued man for\r\nat least 4,000 years. The Babylonians first mentioned the brilliant\r\nplanet on clay tablets as early as 2,000 years before Christ. The\r\nEgyptians, the Greeks, and the Chinese had thought of Venus as two stars\r\nbecause it was visible first in the morning and then in the evening sky.\r\nThe Greeks had called the morning star Phosphorus and the evening star\r\nHesperos. By 500 B.C. Pythagoras, the Greek philosopher, had realized\r\nthat the two were identical.\r\n\r\nGalileo discovered the phases of Venus in 1610. Because of the planet’s\r\nhigh reflectivity, Copernicus falsely concluded that Venus was either\r\nself-luminous or else transparent to the rays of the Sun.\r\n\r\nVenus was tracked across the face of the Sun in 1761, from which event\r\nthe presence of an atmosphere about the planet was deduced because of\r\nthe fuzzy edges of the image visible in the telescope. Throughout the\r\neighteenth and nineteenth centuries, Venus continued to excite growing\r\nscientific curiosity in Europe and America.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _Venus’ orbit is almost circular. At inferior\r\n    conjunction, the planet is between the Earth and the Sun,\r\n    approximately 26,000,000 miles away; at superior conjunction, Venus\r\n    is on the other side of the Sun. The elongations are the farthest\r\n    points to the east and the west of the Earth._]\r\n\r\nEven the development of giant telescopes and the refinement of\r\nspectroscopic and radar astronomy techniques in recent times had yielded\r\nfew indisputable facts about Venus. Until radar studies, made from\r\nGoldstone, California, in 1962, neither the rate nor the angle of axial\r\nspin could be determined with any degree of accuracy. The ever-shifting\r\natmosphere continued to shield the Venusian surface from visual\r\nobservation on Earth, and the nature of its atmosphere became an\r\nespecially controversial mystery.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CONSENSUS PRIOR TO MARINER II\r\n\r\nVenus is a virtual twin of the Earth; it approaches our planet closer\r\nthan any celestial body except the Moon, a few vagrant comets, and other\r\nsuch galactic wanderers. Long fabled in song and legend as the most\r\nbeautiful object in the sky, Venus has an albedo, or reflectivity\r\nfactor, of 59% (the Moon has one of 7%). In its brightest or crescent\r\nphase, Venus glows like a torch, even casting a distinct shadow—the only\r\nbody other than the Sun and the Moon yielding such light.\r\n\r\nVenus’ diameter is approximately 7,700 miles, compared with Earth’s\r\n7,900. Also as compared with 1.0 for the Earth, Venus’ mean density is\r\n0.91, the mass 0.81, and the volume 0.92.\r\n\r\nThe Cytherean orbit (the adjective comes from Cytherea, one of the\r\nancient Greek names for Aphrodite—or in Roman times, Venus—the goddess\r\nof love) is almost a perfect circle, with an eccentricity (or\r\nout-of-roundness) of only 0.0068, lowest of all the planets. Venus rides\r\nthis orbital path at a mean distance from the Sun of 67.2 million miles\r\n(Earth is 93 million miles), and at a mean orbital speed of 78,300 miles\r\nper hour, as compared with Earth’s 66,600 miles per hour.\r\n\r\nIt also has a shorter sidereal period (revolution around the Sun or\r\nyear): 224 Earth days, 16 hours, 48 minutes. Estimates of the Venus\r\nrotational period, or the length of the Venus day, have ranged from\r\napproximately 23 Earth hours to just over 224 Earth days. The latter\r\nrotation rate would be almost equivalent to the Venusian year and, in\r\nsuch case, the planet would always have the same face to the Sun.\r\n\r\nVenus approaches within 26 million miles of the Earth at inferior\r\nconjunction, and is as far away as 160 million miles at superior\r\nconjunction, when it is on the opposite side of the Sun.\r\n\r\nThe escape velocity (that velocity required to free an object from the\r\ngravitational pull of a planet) on Venus is 6.3 miles per second,\r\ncompared with Earth’s escape velocity of 7 miles per second. The gravity\r\nof the Earth is sufficient to trap an oxygen-bearing atmosphere near the\r\nterrestrial surface. Because the escape velocity of Venus is about the\r\nsame as that of Earth, men have long believed (or hoped) that the\r\nCytherean world might hold a similar atmosphere and thus be favorable to\r\nthe existence of living organisms as we know them on the Earth. From\r\nthis speculation, numerous theories have evolved.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CYTHEREAN RIDDLE: LIVING WORLD OR INCINERATED PLANET\r\n\r\nBefore Mariner II, Venus probably caused more controversy than any other\r\nplanet in our solar system except Mars. Observers have visualized Venus\r\nas anything from a steaming abode of Mesozoic-like creatures such as\r\nwere found on the Earth millions of years ago, to a dead, noxious, and\r\nsunless world constantly ravaged by winds of incredible force.\r\n\r\nConjectures about the Venusian atmosphere have been inescapably tied to\r\ntheories about the Venusian topography. Because the clouds forming the\r\nVenusian atmosphere, as viewed from the Earth through the strongest\r\ntelescopes, are almost featureless, this relationship between atmosphere\r\nand topography has posed many problems.\r\n\r\nImpermanent light spots and certain dusky areas were believed by some\r\nobservers to be associated with Venusian oceans. One scientist believed\r\nhe identified a mountain peak which he calculated as rising more than 27\r\nmiles above the general level of the planet.\r\n\r\nAnother feature of the Venusian topography is the lack of (detectable)\r\npolar flattening. The Earth does have such a flattening at the poles and\r\nit was reasoned that, because Venus did not, its rate of rotation must\r\nbe much slower than that of the Earth, perhaps as little as only once\r\nduring a Venusian year, thus keeping one face perpetually toward the\r\nSun.\r\n\r\nAnother school of thought speculated that Venus was covered entirely by\r\nvast oceans; other observers concluded that these great bodies of water\r\nhave long since evaporated and that the winds, through the Cytherean\r\nages, have scooped up the remaining chloride salts and blasted them into\r\nthe Venusian skies, thus forming the clouds.\r\n\r\nRelated to the topographic speculations were equally tenuous theories\r\nabout its atmosphere. It was reasoned that if the oceans of Venus still\r\nexist, then the Venusian clouds may be composed of water droplets; if\r\nVenus were covered by water, it was suggested that it might be inhabited\r\nby Venusian equivalents of Earth’s Cambrian period of 500 million years\r\nago, and the same steamy atmosphere could be a possibility.\r\n\r\nOther theories respecting the nature of the Venusian atmosphere,\r\ndepending on how their authors viewed the Venusian terrain, included\r\nclouds of hydrocarbons (perhaps droplets of oil), or vapors of\r\nformaldehyde and water. Finally, the seemingly high temperature of the\r\nplanet’s surface, as measured by Earth-bound instruments, was credited\r\nby some to the false indications that could be given by a Cytherean\r\nionosphere heavily charged with free electrons.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _As seen from Earth, Venus is brightest at its\r\n    crescent phases as shown in these six photographs made by the\r\n    100-inch telescope at Mt. Wilson, California._]\r\n\r\nHowever, the consensus of pre-Mariner scientific thinking seemed\r\ngenerally to indicate no detectable free oxygen in the atmosphere; this\r\nfact inveighed against the probability of surface vegetation, because\r\nEarth-bound vegetation, at least, uses carbon dioxide and gives off\r\noxygen into the atmosphere. On the other hand, a preponderance of carbon\r\ndioxide in the Venusian atmosphere was measured which would create a\r\ngreenhouse effect. The heat of the Sun would be trapped near the surface\r\nof the planet, raising the temperature to as high as 615 degrees F. If\r\nthe topography were in truth relatively flat and the rate of rotation\r\nslow, the heating effect might produce winds of 400 miles per hour or\r\nmore, and sand and dust storms beyond Earthly experience. And so the\r\ncontroversy continued.\r\n\r\nBut at 1:53.13.9 a.m., EST, on August 27, 1962, the theories of the past\r\nfew centuries were being challenged. At that moment, the night along the\r\neast Florida coast was shattered by the roar of rocket engines and the\r\nflash of incandescent exhaust streams. The United States was launching\r\nMariner II, the first spacecraft that would successfully penetrate\r\ninterplanetary space and probe some of the age-old mysteries of our\r\nneighbor planet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER 2\r\n                          PREPARING FOR SPACE\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1961, the United States was pushing hard to strengthen\r\nits position in the exploration of space and the near planets. The\r\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration was planning two projects,\r\nboth to be launched by an Atlas booster and a Centaur high-energy second\r\nstage capable of much better performance than that available from\r\nearlier vehicles.\r\n\r\nThe Mariner program had two goals: Mariner A was ticketed for Venus and\r\nMariner B was scheduled to go to Mars. Caltech’s Jet Propulsion\r\nLaboratory had management responsibility under NASA for both projects.\r\nThese spacecraft were both to be in the 1,000- to 1,250-pound class.\r\nLaunch opportunities for the two planets were to be best during the\r\n1962-1964 period and the new second-stage booster known as Centaur was\r\nexpected to be ready for these operations.\r\n\r\nBut trouble was developing for NASA’s planners. By August, 1961, it had\r\nbecome apparent that the Centaur would not be flying in time to take\r\nadvantage of the 1962 third-quarter firing period, when Venus would\r\napproach inferior conjunction with the Earth. JPL studied the problem\r\nand advised NASA that a proposed lightweight, hybrid spacecraft\r\ncombining certain design features of Ranger III (a lunar spacecraft) and\r\nMariner A could be launched to Venus in 1962 aboard a lower-powered\r\nAtlas-Agena B launch vehicle.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _The Mariner II spacecraft was launched by an Atlas\r\n    first-stage booster vehicle and an Agena B second stage with restart\r\n    capability._]\r\n\r\n  ATLAS-AGENA ADAPTER\r\n  AGENA B\r\n  MARINER SPACECRAFT\r\n  SHROUD\r\n\r\nThe proposed spacecraft would be called Mariner R and was to weigh about\r\n460 pounds and carry 25 pounds of scientific instruments (later\r\nincreased to 40 pounds). The restart capability of Agena was to be used\r\nin a 98-statute-mile parking orbit. (The orbit was later raised to 115\r\nstatute miles and the spacecraft weight was reduced to about 447\r\npounds.)\r\n\r\nTwo spacecraft would be launched one after the other from the same pad\r\nwithin a maximum launch period extending over 56 days from July to\r\nSeptember, 1962. The minimum launch separation between the two\r\nspacecraft would be 21 days.\r\n\r\nAs a result of the JPL recommendations, NASA cancelled Mariner A in\r\nSeptember, 1961, and assigned JPL to manage a Mariner R Project to fly\r\ntwo spacecraft (Mariner I and II) to the vicinity of Venus in 1962.\r\nScientific measurements were to be made in interplanetary space and in\r\nthe immediate environs of the planet, which would also be surveyed in an\r\nattempt to determine the characteristics of its atmosphere and surface.\r\nScientific and engineering data would also be transmitted from the\r\nspacecraft to the Earth while it was in transit and during the encounter\r\nwith Venus.\r\n\r\nScientists and engineers were now faced with an arduous task. Within an\r\n11-month period, on a schedule that could tolerate no delays, two\r\nspacecraft had to be designed, developed, assembled, tested, and\r\nlaunched. In order to meet the schedule, tested flight assemblies and\r\ninstruments would have to be in the Pasadena assembly facility by\r\nmid-January, 1962, just four months after the start of the project.\r\nProbably no other major space project of similar scope had ever been\r\nplanned on such a demanding schedule.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _Mariner II travelled across 180 million miles of\r\n    space within our solar system as it spanned the gap between Earth\r\n    and Venus (shown here as the third and second planets, respectively,\r\n    from the Sun)._]\r\n\r\nWith the shipment of equipment to Atlantic Missile Range (AMR) scheduled\r\nfor 9½ months after inception of the project, management and design\r\nteams went all-out on a true “crash” effort. Quick decisions had to be\r\nmade, a workable design had to be agreed upon very early, and, once\r\nestablished, the major schedule objectives could not be changed. Certain\r\ndesign modifications and manufacturing changes in the Atlas-Agena launch\r\nvehicle were also necessary.\r\n\r\nWherever possible, Ranger design technology had to be used in the new\r\nspacecraft and adapted to the requirements of a planetary probe. Other\r\nnecessary tasks included trajectory calculation; arrangements for\r\nlaunch, space flight, and tracking operations; and coordination of AMR\r\nRange support.\r\n\r\nFollowing NASA’s September, 1961 decision to go ahead with the Mariner R\r\nProject, JPL’s Director, Dr. William H. Pickering, called on his\r\nseasoned team of scientists and engineers. Under Robert J. Parks,\r\nPlanetary Program Director, Jack N. James was appointed as Project\r\nManager for Mariner R, assisted by W. A. Collier. Dan Schneiderman was\r\nappointed Spacecraft System Manager, and Dr. Eberhardt Rechtin headed\r\nthe space tracking program, with supervision of the Deep Space\r\nInstrumentation Facility (DSIF) operations under Dr. Nicholas Renzetti.\r\nThe Mariner space flight operations were directed by Marshall S.\r\nJohnson.\r\n\r\n\r\nA PROBLEM IN CELESTIAL DYNAMICS\r\n\r\nIn order to send Mariner close enough to Venus for its instruments to\r\ngather significant data, scientists had to solve aiming and guidance\r\nproblems of unprecedented magnitude and complexity.\r\n\r\nThe 447-pound spacecraft had to be catapulted from a launching platform\r\nmoving around the Sun at 66,600 miles per hour, and aimed so precisely\r\nthat it would intercept a planet moving 78,300 miles per hour (or 11,700\r\nmiles per hour faster than the Earth) at a point in space and time some\r\n180.2 million miles away and 109 days later, with only one chance to\r\ncorrect the trajectory by a planned midcourse maneuver.\r\n\r\nAnd the interception had to be so accurate that the spacecraft would\r\npass Venus within 8,000 to 40,000 miles. The chances of impacting the\r\nplanet could not exceed 1 in 1,000 because Mariner was not sterilized\r\nand might contaminate Venus. Also, much more data could be gathered on a\r\nnear-miss flight path than on impact. Furthermore, at encounter (in the\r\ntarget area) the spacecraft had to be so positioned that it could\r\ncommunicate with Earth, see the Sun with its solar panels, and scan\r\nVenus at the proper angles.\r\n\r\nAlong the way, Mariner had to be able to orient itself so that its solar\r\npanels were facing or “locked onto” the Sun in order to generate its own\r\npower; acquire and maintain antenna orientation to the Earth; correct\r\nits attitude constantly to hold Earth and Sun lock; receive, store, and\r\nexecute commands to alter its course for a closer approach to Venus; and\r\ncommunicate its findings to Earth with only 3 watts of radiated power\r\nand over distances never before spanned.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _Mariner II was launched in a direction opposite to\r\n    the orbital travel of the Earth. The Sun’s gravity then pulled it in\r\n    toward the planet Venus._]\r\n\r\nEarly in the program it had been decided that two spacecraft would be\r\nlaunched toward Venus. Only 56 days were available for both launchings\r\nand the planet would not be close enough again for 19 months—the period\r\nbetween inferior conjunctions or the planet’s closest approach to the\r\nEarth. On any one of these days, a maximum of 2 hours could be used for\r\ngetting the vehicles off the launch pad. In addition, the Mariners would\r\nhave to leave the Earth in a direction opposite to that of the Earth’s\r\ndirection of orbital revolution around the Sun. This flight path was\r\nnecessary so the spacecraft could then fall in toward the Sun and\r\nintercept Venus, catching and passing the Earth along the way, about 65\r\ndays and 11.5 million miles out.\r\n\r\nThis feat of celestial navigation had to be performed while passing\r\nthrough the hostile environment of interplanetary space, where the probe\r\nmight be subjected to solar winds (charged particles) travelling at\r\nvelocities up to 500 miles per second; intense bombardment from cosmic\r\nradiation, charged protons, and alpha particles moving perhaps 1.5\r\nmillion miles per hour; radiated heat that might raise the spacecraft\r\ntemperatures to unknown values; and the unknown dangers from cosmic\r\ndust, meteorites, and other miscellaneous space debris.\r\n\r\nIn flight, each spacecraft would have to perform more than 90,000\r\nmeasurements per day, reporting back to the Earth on 52 engineering\r\nreadings, the changes in interplanetary magnetic fields, the density and\r\ndistribution of charged particles and cosmic dust, and the intensity and\r\nvelocity of low-energy protons streaming out from the Sun.\r\n\r\nAt its closest approach to Venus, the spacecraft instruments would be\r\nrequired to scan the planet during a brief 35-minute encounter, to\r\ngather data that would enable Earth scientists to determine the\r\ntemperature and structure of the atmosphere and the surface, and to\r\nprocess and transmit that data back to the Earth.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ORGANIZATION\r\n\r\nFlying Mariner to Venus was a team effort made possible through the\r\ncombined resources of several United States governmental organizations\r\nand their contractors, science, and industry. The success of the Mariner\r\nProject resulted primarily from the over-all direction and management of\r\nthe National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the Jet Propulsion\r\nLaboratory, and the production and launch capabilities of the vehicle\r\nbuilders and the Air Force. Several organizations bore the major\r\nresponsibility: NASA Headquarters, JPL, NASA’s Marshall Space Flight\r\nCenter and Launch Operations Center, Astronautics Division of General\r\nDynamics, and Lockheed Missiles and Space Company.\r\n\r\n\r\nNASA: FOR SCIENCE\r\n\r\nThe National Aeronautics and Space Administration was an outgrowth of\r\nthe participation of the United States in the International Geophysical\r\nYear program and of the nation’s space effort, revitalized following\r\nRussia’s successful orbiting of Sputnik I in 1957.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _Final NACA meeting, August 21, 1958._]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _Model of X-1 research plane._]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _Headquarters of National Aeronautics and Space\r\n    Administration, Washington, D.C._]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _JPL developed first JATO units in 1941._]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _Other Laboratory Projects were the Corporal missile\r\n    (left) and Explorer I (right), the first U.S. satellite._]\r\n\r\nUnder the terms of the law which created NASA, it is a Federal Agency\r\ndedicated to carrying out “activities in space ... devoted to peaceful\r\npurposes for the benefit of all mankind.” NASA is charged to preserve\r\nthe role of our nation as a leader in the aeronautical and space\r\nsciences and technology and to utilize effectively the science and\r\nengineering resources of the United States in accomplishing these goals.\r\nActivities associated with military operations in space and the\r\ndevelopment of weapons systems are specifically assigned to the Defense\r\nDepartment.\r\n\r\nIn November, 1957, before the creation of NASA, President Eisenhower had\r\nestablished a Scientific Advisory Committee to determine the national\r\nobjectives and requirements in space and to establish the basic\r\nframework within which science, industry, and the academic community\r\ncould best support these objectives.\r\n\r\nThe Committee submitted a report to the President in March, 1958,\r\nrecommending creation of a civilian agency to conduct the national space\r\nprograms. The recommendation, endorsed by the President, was submitted\r\nto the Congress on April 2, 1958. The National Aeronautics and Space Act\r\nof 1958 was passed and became law in July, 1958.\r\n\r\nNASA was officially established on October 1, 1958, and Dr. T. Keith\r\nGlennan, President of Case Institute of Technology, was appointed as the\r\nfirst Administrator. The facilities and personnel of the National\r\nAdvisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) were transferred to form the\r\nnucleus of the new NASA agency.\r\n\r\nNACA had performed important and significant research in aeronautics,\r\nwind tunnel technology, and aerodynamics since 1915, including a series\r\nof experimental rocket research aircraft that culminated in the X-15. It\r\nwas natural that it be expanded to include space operations.\r\n\r\nAmong the NACA Centers transferred to NASA were the Langley Research\r\nCenter at Hampton, Virginia; Lewis Research Center, Cleveland, Ohio;\r\nAmes Research Center, Moffett Field, California; Flight Research Center,\r\nEdwards, California; and the rocket launch facility at Wallops Island,\r\nVirginia.\r\n\r\nThose personnel of the Naval Research Laboratory who had been working on\r\nProject Vanguard were also transferred to NASA, as was the project.\r\nThese personnel are now part of the new Goddard Space Flight Center at\r\nGreenbelt, Maryland.\r\n\r\nThe October, 1958, transfers also included a number of the space\r\nprojects of the Advanced Research Projects Agency of the Defense\r\nDepartment. In a December, 1958, Executive Order, the President assigned\r\nthe former Army facilities of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory at Pasadena,\r\nCalifornia, to NASA. At the same time, the group working under Dr.\r\nWernher von Braun at the Army Ballistic Missile Agency (commanded by\r\nMajor General John B. Medaris) was made responsive to NASA requirements.\r\n\r\nOn July 1, 1960, the George C. Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) was\r\norganized at Huntsville under von Braun’s direction. The former\r\nDevelopment Operations Division of ABMA formed the nucleus of the new\r\nCenter. The MSFC mission was to procure and to supervise the adaptation\r\nof launch vehicles for NASA space missions, including Atlas, Thor, and\r\nAgena. Marshall is directly responsible for the design and development\r\nof advanced, high-thrust booster vehicles such as the Saturn C-1 and C-5\r\nand the Nova.\r\n\r\nAn agency to conduct NASA affairs at Cape Canaveral was formed within\r\nMSFC on July 1, 1960. Known then as the Launch Operations Directorate\r\n(LOD), it was directed by Dr. Kurt H. Debus. LOD became independent of\r\nMarshall in March, 1962, when it was redesignated the Launch Operations\r\nCenter (LOC), reporting directly to the Office of Manned Space Flight.\r\nThis separation resulted largely because the activities at AMR were\r\nbecoming more operational in character and less oriented toward research\r\nand development.\r\n\r\nLOC handles such functions for NASA as the scheduling of launch dates\r\nand liaison with the Atlantic Missile Range for support activities. The\r\nCenter will have the responsibility in the field for assembly, checkout,\r\nand launch of the Saturn and Nova boosters.\r\n\r\nFollowing the election of President Kennedy in 1961, James E. Webb\r\nreplaced Dr. Glennan as Administrator of NASA. Shortly after, a new\r\nnational goal was announced—placing a man on the Moon and returning him\r\nsafely to the Earth in this decade. Meanwhile, JPL had been assigned\r\nresponsibility for unmanned exploration of the Moon, the planets, and\r\ninterplanetary space, and thus was charged with supporting the NASA\r\nmanned flight program through these activities.\r\n\r\nIn less than five years, NASA grew to include eight flight and research\r\ncenters and about 21,000 technical and management personnel. Within\r\nNASA, Dr. Abe Silverstein’s Office of Space Flight Programs was\r\nresponsible for the Mariner R Project which was directly assigned to Ed\r\nCortright, Director of Lunar & Planetary Programs, and Fred\r\nKochendorfer, who is NASA’s Program Chief for Mariner. A subsequent\r\nreorganization placed responsibility under Dr. Homer Newell’s Office of\r\nSpace Sciences, and Oran Nicks became Director of Lunar & Planetary\r\nPrograms.\r\n\r\n\r\nJPL: JATO TO MARINER\r\n\r\nThe Jet Propulsion Laboratory, staffed and operated for NASA by\r\nCalifornia Institute of Technology, had long been active in research and\r\ndevelopment in the fields of missiles, rockets, and the space-associated\r\nsciences. The first government-sponsored rocket research group in the\r\nUnited States, JPL had originated on the Caltech campus in 1939, an\r\noutgrowth of the Guggenheim Aeronautical Laboratories, then headed by\r\ncelebrated aerodynamicist Dr. Theodore von Karman.\r\n\r\nVon Karman and his associates moved their operation to a remote spot at\r\nthe foot of the San Gabriel mountains and, working from this base, in\r\n1941 the pioneering group developed the first successful jet-assisted\r\naircraft takeoff (JATO) units for the Army Air Force. The Laboratory\r\nbegan a long association with the Army Ordnance Corps in 1944, when the\r\nPrivate A test rocket was developed. In retrospect, it is now recognized\r\nthat the Private A was the first U. S. surface-to-surface,\r\nsolid-propellant rocket. Its range was 10 miles!\r\n\r\nJPL’s WAC Corporal rocket set a U. S. high-altitude record of 43.5 miles\r\nin 1945. Mounted on a German V-2 as the Bumper-WAC, it achieved an\r\naltitude record of 250 miles in 1947. More important, this event was the\r\nfirst successful in-flight separation of a two-stage rocket—the\r\nfeasibility of space exploration had been proved.\r\n\r\nAfter the end of World War II, JPL research set the stage for\r\nhigh-energy solid-propellant rockets. For the first time the solid\r\npropellants, which contained both fuel and oxidizers, were cast in\r\nthin-walled cases. Techniques were then developed for bonding the\r\npropellants to the case, and burning radially outward from the central\r\naxis was achieved. Attention was then turned to increasing the energy of\r\nthe propellants.\r\n\r\nBy 1947, the Corporal E, a new liquid-propellant research rocket, was\r\nbeing fired. JPL was asked to convert it into a tactical weapon in 1949.\r\nThe Corporal E then became the first liquid-propellant\r\nsurface-to-surface guided missile developed by the United States or the\r\nWestern bloc of nations.\r\n\r\nBecause of the need for higher mobility and increased firing rate, JPL\r\nlater designed and developed the solid-propellant Sergeant—the nation’s\r\nfirst “second-generation” weapon system. This inertially guided missile\r\nwas immune to electronic countermeasures by an enemy.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, JPL scientists had pioneered in the development of electronic\r\ntelemetering techniques, which permit an accurate monitoring of system\r\nperformance while missiles are in flight. By 1944, Dr. William H.\r\nPickering, a New Zealand born and Caltech-trained physicist who had\r\nworked with Dr. Robert Millikan in cosmic ray research, had been placed\r\nin charge of the telemetering effort at JPL. Pickering became Director\r\nof the Laboratory in 1954.\r\n\r\nFollowing the launching of Sputnik I, the Army-JPL team which had worked\r\non the Jupiter C missile to test nose cones, was assigned the\r\nresponsibility for putting the first United States satellite into orbit\r\nas soon as possible. In just 83 days, a modified Jupiter C launch\r\nvehicle was prepared, an instrumented payload was assembled, a network\r\nof space communications stations was established, and Explorer I was\r\norbited on January 31, 1958. Explorer was an instrumented assembly\r\ndeveloped by JPL and the State University of Iowa. It discovered the\r\ninner Van Allen radiation belt.\r\n\r\nSubsequently, JPL worked with the Army on other projects to explore\r\nspace and to orbit satellites. Among these were Pioneer III, which\r\nlocated the outer Van Allen Belt, and Pioneer IV, the first U. S. space\r\nprobe to reach Earth-escape velocity and to perform a lunar fly-by\r\nmission.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL DYNAMICS: THE ATLAS\r\n\r\nThe launch vehicle for Mariner was an Atlas D booster with an Agena B\r\nsecond stage. Historically, Atlas can be traced to October, 1954, when\r\nthe former Convair Corporation (later acquired by General Dynamics) was\r\ninvited to submit proposals for research and development of four missile\r\nsystems, including a 5,000-mile intercontinental weapon.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1946, Convair assigned K. J. Bossart to begin a study of two\r\nproposed types of 5,000-mile missiles: one jet powered at subsonic\r\nspeeds, with wings for aerodynamic control; the other a supersonic,\r\nballistic (wingless and bullet-like), rocket-powered missile capable of\r\noperating outside the Earth’s atmosphere.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _Photo courtesy of General Dynamics/Astro_\r\n    _Atlas missiles in assembly facility at General\r\n    Dynamics/Astronautics plant._]\r\n\r\nThis was the beginning of Project MX-774, lineal ancestor of Atlas.\r\nAfter captive testing at San Diego in 1947, three of the experimental\r\nmissiles were test-launched at White Sands Proving Ground in New Mexico.\r\nThe first flight failed at 6,200 feet after a premature engine burnout.\r\n\r\nIn 1947, the Air Force shelved the MX-774 project. However, this brief\r\nprogram had proved the feasibility of three concepts later used in\r\nAtlas: swiveling engines for directional control; lightweight,\r\npressurized airframe structures; and separable nose cones.\r\n\r\nThe Korean War stimulated the ICBM concept and, in 1951, a new MX-1593\r\ncontract was awarded to Convair to study ballistic and glide rockets. By\r\nSeptember, 1951, Convair was proposing a ballistic missile that would\r\nincorporate some of the features of the MX-774 design. A plan for an\r\naccelerated program was presented to the Air Force in 1953. After a year\r\nof study, a full go-ahead for the project, now called Atlas, was given\r\nin January, 1955.\r\n\r\nThe unit handling the Atlas program was set up as Convair Astronautics,\r\nwith J. R. Dempsey as president, on March 1, 1957.\r\n\r\nThe first Atlas test flight, in June of 1957, ended in destruction of\r\nthe missile when it went out of control. Following another abortive\r\nattempt, the first fully successful flight of an Atlas missile was made\r\nfrom Cape Canaveral on December 17, 1957.\r\n\r\nThe Atlas program was in full swing by 1958, when 14 test missions were\r\nflown. The entire missile was orbited in December, 1958, as Project\r\nScore. It carried the voice of President Eisenhower as a Christmas\r\nmessage to the world. The Atlas missile system was accepted for field\r\noperations by the Air Force in 1958.\r\n\r\nAlso in 1958, an Atlas achieved a new distance record, flying more than\r\n9,000 miles down the Atlantic Missile Range, where it landed in the\r\nIndian Ocean, off the South African coast.\r\n\r\nAtlas has been modified for use by NASA as a space vehicle booster.\r\nKnown as the Atlas D, it has launched lunar probes, communications and\r\nscientific Earth satellites, and manned space vehicles.\r\n\r\n\r\nLOCKHEED: AGENA B\r\n\r\nThe Lockheed Agena B second-stage vehicle was mounted on top of the\r\nAtlas booster in the launch of the Mariner spacecraft. The U. S. Air\r\nForce had first asked Lockheed Missiles and Space Division, headed by L.\r\nE. Root, to work on an advanced orbital vehicle for both military and\r\nscientific applications in 1956. On October 29 of that year, Lockheed\r\nwas appointed prime weapon system contractor on the new Agena Project,\r\nunder the Air Force Ballistic Missile Division. In order to speed the\r\nprogram, the Thor missile was used as the booster stage for the early\r\nAgena flights. The Atlas was also utilized in later operations.\r\n\r\nIn August, 1957, the Air Force recommended that the program be\r\naccelerated as much as possible. After Russia orbited Sputnik I in\r\nOctober of 1957, a further speed-up was ordered.\r\n\r\nThe first of the Agena-Discoverer series was launched into orbit on\r\nFebruary 28, 1959, with the Thor missile as the booster. The first\r\nrestart in orbit occurred on February 18, 1961, when the new Agena B\r\nconfiguration was used to put Discoverer XXI into orbit. All of the NASA\r\nmissions using Agena, beginning with Ranger I in August, 1961, have been\r\nflown with the B model.\r\n\r\nAgena holds several orbiting records for U. S. vehicles. The first water\r\nrecovery followed the 17 orbits of Discoverer XIII on August 11, 1960.\r\nThe first air recovery of a capsule from orbit occurred with Discoverer\r\nXIV on August 18, 1960. In all, a total of 11 capsules were recovered\r\nfrom orbit, 7 in the air, 4 from the sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER 3\r\n                             THE SPACECRAFT\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the 11 brief months which JPL had to produce the Mariner spacecraft\r\nsystem, there was no possibility of designing an entirely new\r\nspacecraft. JPL’s solution to the problem was derived largely from the\r\nLaboratory’s earlier space exploration vehicles, such as the Vega, the\r\nRanger lunar series, and the cancelled Mariner A.\r\n\r\nWherever possible, components and subsystems designed for these projects\r\nwere either utilized or redesigned. Where equipment was purchased from\r\nindustrial contractors, existing hardware was adapted, if practicable.\r\nOnly a minimum of testing could be performed on newly designed equipment\r\nand lengthy evaluation of “breadboard” mock-ups was out of the question.\r\n\r\nReady for launch, the spacecraft measured 5 feet in diameter and 9 feet\r\n11 inches in height. With the solar panels and the directional antenna\r\nunfolded in the cruise position, Mariner was 16 feet 6 inches wide and\r\n11 feet 11 inches high.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SPACEFRAME\r\n\r\nThe design engineers were forced to work within the framework of the\r\nearlier spacecraft technology because of the time restrictions, but\r\nMariner I and II could weigh only about half as much as the Ranger\r\nspacecraft and just over one-third as much as the planned Mariner A.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _Mariner spacecraft with solar panels, microwave\r\n    radiometer, and directional antenna extended in flight position.\r\n    Principal components are shown._]\r\n\r\n  ROLL AXIS\r\n  OMNIANTENNA\r\n  MAGNETOMETER SENSOR\r\n  PARTICLE FLUX DETECTORS (GEIGER TUBES)\r\n  RADIOMETER REFERENCE HORNS\r\n  MICROWAVE RADIOMETER\r\n  INFRARED RADIOMETER\r\n  ION-CHAMBER\r\n  COSMIC DUST DETECTOR\r\n  EARTH SENSOR\r\n  SOLAR PANEL\r\n  COMMAND ANTENNA\r\n  SOLAR SAIL\r\n  ATTITUDE CONTROL GAS BOTTLES\r\n  SOLAR PLASMA DETECTOR\r\n  DIRECTIONAL ANTENNA\r\n\r\nThe basic structural unit of Mariner was a hexagonal frame made of\r\nmagnesium and aluminum, to which was attached an aluminum\r\nsuperstructure, a liquid-propelled rocket engine for midcourse\r\ntrajectory correction, six rectangular chassis mounted one on each face\r\nof the hexagonal structure, a high-gain directional antenna, the Sun\r\nsensors, and gas jets for control of the spacecraft’s attitude.\r\n\r\nThe tubular, truss-type superstructure extended upward from the base\r\nhexagon. It provided support for the solar panels while latched under\r\nthe shroud during the launch phase, and for the radiometers, the\r\nmagnetometer, and the nondirectional antenna, which was mounted at the\r\ntop of the structure. The superstructure was designed to be as light as\r\npossible, yet be capable of withstanding the predicted load stresses.\r\n\r\nThe six magnesium chassis mounted to the base hexagon housed the\r\nfollowing equipment: the electronics circuits for the six scientific\r\nexperiments, the communications system electronics; the data encoder\r\n(for processing data before telemetering it to the Earth) and the\r\ncommand electronics; the attitude control, digital computer, and timing\r\nsequencer circuits; a power control and battery charger assembly; and\r\nthe battery assembly.\r\n\r\nThe allotment of weights for Mariner II forced rigid limitation in the\r\nstructural design of the spacecraft. As launched, the weights of the\r\nmajor spacecraft subsystems were as follows:\r\n\r\n          Structure                             77 pounds\r\n          Solar panels                          48 pounds\r\n          Electronics                          146 pounds\r\n          Propulsion                            32 pounds\r\n          Battery                               33 pounds\r\n          Scientific experiments                41 pounds\r\n          Miscellaneous equipment               70 pounds\r\n          Gross weight                         447 pounds\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE POWER SYSTEM\r\n\r\nMariner II was self-sufficient in power. It converted energy from\r\nsunlight into electrical current through the use of solar panels\r\ncomposed of photoelectric cells which charged a battery installed in one\r\nof the six chassis on the hexagonal base. The control, switching, and\r\nregulating circuits were housed in another of the chassis cases.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _This hexagonal frame, constructed of magnesium and\r\n    aluminum, is the basic supporting structure around which the Mariner\r\n    spacecraft is assembled._]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _Plan view from top showing six magnesium chassis\r\n    hinged in open position._]\r\n\r\n  VIEW LOOKING AFT ASSEMBLIES HINGED IN OPEN POSITION\r\n    SCIENTIFIC EQUIPMENT ASSEMBLY I\r\n    COMMUNICATIONS ASSEMBLY II\r\n    DATA ENCODER AND COMMAND ASSEMBLY III\r\n    ATTITUDE CONTROL AND CC AND S ASSEMBLY IV\r\n    POWER ASSEMBLY V\r\n    BATTERY ASSEMBLY VI\r\n\r\nThe battery operated the spacecraft systems during the period from\r\nlaunch until the solar panels were faced onto the Sun. In addition, the\r\nbattery supplied power during trajectory maneuvers when the panels were\r\ntemporarily out of sight of the Sun. It shared the demand for power when\r\nthe panels were overloaded. The battery furnished power directly for\r\nswitching various equipment in flight and for certain other heavy loads\r\nof brief duration, such as the detonation of explosive devices for\r\nreleasing the solar panels.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _Mariner spacecraft with solar panels in open\r\n    position. Note extension to left panel to balance solar pressures in\r\n    flight._]\r\n\r\nThe Mariner battery used sealed silver-zinc cells and had a capacity of\r\n1000 watt-hours. It weighed 33 pounds and was recharged in flight by the\r\nsolar panels.\r\n\r\nThe solar panels, as originally designed, were 60 inches long by 30\r\ninches wide and contained approximately 9800 solar cells in a total area\r\nof 27 square feet. Each solar cell produced only about 230\r\none-thousandths of a volt. The entire array was designed to convert the\r\nSun’s energy to electrical power in the range between 148 and 222 watts.\r\nWhen a later design change required the extension of one panel in order\r\nto add more solar cells, it was necessary to add a blank extension to\r\nthe other panel in order to balance the solar pressure on the\r\nspacecraft.\r\n\r\nIn order to protect the solar cells from the infrared and ultraviolet\r\nradiation of the Sun, which would produce heat but no electrical energy,\r\neach cell was shielded from these rays by a glass filter which was\r\nnevertheless transparent to the light which the cells converted into\r\npower.\r\n\r\nThe power subsystem electronics circuits were housed in another of the\r\nhexagon chassis cases. This equipment was designed to receive and switch\r\npower either from the solar panels, the battery, or a combination of the\r\ntwo, to a booster-regulator.\r\n\r\n\r\nCC&S: THE BRAIN AND THE STOPWATCH\r\n\r\nOnce the Atlas booster lifted Mariner off the launch pad, the digital\r\nCentral Computer and Sequencer (CC&S) performed certain computations and\r\nprovided the basic timing control for those spacecraft subsystems which\r\nrequired a sequenced programming control.\r\n\r\nThe CC&S was designed to initiate the operations of the spacecraft in\r\nthree distinct sequences or “modes”: (1) the launch mode, from launch\r\nthrough the cruise configuration; (2) the midcourse propulsion mode,\r\nwhen Mariner readjusted its sights on Venus; and (3) the encounter mode,\r\ninvolving commands for data collection in the immediate vicinity of the\r\nplanet.\r\n\r\nThe CC&S timed Mariner’s actions as it travelled more than 180 million\r\nmiles in pursuit of Venus. A highly accurate electronic clock\r\n(crystal-controlled oscillator) scheduled the operations of the\r\nspacecraft subsystems. The oscillator frequency of 307.2 kilocycles was\r\nreduced to the 2,400- and 400-cycle-per-second output required for the\r\npower subsystem.\r\n\r\nThe control oscillator also timed the issuance of commands by the CC&S\r\nin each of the three operating modes of the spacecraft.\r\n\r\nA 1-pulse-per-minute signal was provided for such launch sequence events\r\nas the extension of the solar panels 44 minutes after launch, turning on\r\npower for the attitude control subsystem one hour after launch, and for\r\ncertain velocity correction commands during the midcourse maneuver.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _The spacecraft used two antennas for communication.\r\n    The omni-antenna (top) was utilized when the directional antenna\r\n    (bottom) could not be pointed at the Earth._]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _This command antenna (on solar panel) was used to\r\n    receive maneuver commands._]\r\n\r\nA 1-pulse-per-second signal was generated as a reference during the roll\r\nand pitch maneuvers in the midcourse trajectory correction phase. One\r\npulse was generated every 3.3 hours in order to initiate the command to\r\norient the directional antenna on the Earth at 167 hours after launch.\r\n\r\nFinally, one pulse every 16.7 hours was used to readjust the\r\nEarth-oriented direction of the antenna throughout the flight.\r\n\r\n\r\nTELECOMMUNICATIONS: RELAYING THE DATA\r\n\r\nThe telecommunications subsystem enabled Mariner to receive and to\r\ndecode commands from the Earth, to encode and to transmit information\r\nconcerning space and Mariner’s own functioning, and to provide a means\r\nfor precise measurement of the spacecraft’s velocity and position\r\nrelative to the Earth. The spacecraft accomplished all these functions\r\nusing only 3 watts of transmitted power up to a maximum range of 53.9\r\nmillion miles.\r\n\r\nA data encoder unit, with CC&S sequencing, timed the three phases of\r\nMariner’s journey: (1) In the launch mode, only engineering data on\r\nspacecraft performance were transmitted; (2) during the cruise mode,\r\ninformation concerning space and Mariner’s own functioning was\r\ntransmitted; and (3) while the spacecraft was in the vicinity of Venus,\r\nonly scientific information concerning the planet was to be transmitted.\r\n(The CC&S failed to start the third mode automatically and it was\r\ninitiated by radio command from the Earth.) After the encounter with\r\nVenus, Mariner was programmed to switch back to the cruise mode for\r\nhandling both engineering and science data (this sequence was also\r\ncommanded by Earth radio).\r\n\r\nMariner II used a technique for modulating (superimposing intelligent\r\ninformation) its radio carrier with telemetry data known as phase-shift\r\nkeying. In this system, the coded signals from the telemetry\r\nmeasurements displace another signal of the same frequency but of a\r\ndifferent phase. These displacements in phase are received on the Earth\r\nand then translated back into the codes which indicate the voltage,\r\ntemperature, intensity, or other values measured by the spacecraft\r\ntelemetry sensors or scientific instruments.\r\n\r\nA continually repeating code, almost noise-like both in sound and\r\nappearance on an oscilloscope, was used for synchronizing the ground\r\nreceiver decoder with the spacecraft. This decoder then deciphered the\r\ndata carried on the information channel.\r\n\r\nThis technique was called a two-channel, binary-coded, pseudo-noise\r\ncommunication system and it was used to modulate a radio signal for\r\ntransmission, just as in any other radio system.\r\n\r\nRadio command signals transmitted to Mariner were decoded in a command\r\nsubassembly, processed, and routed to the proper using devices. A\r\ntransponder was used to receive the commands, send back confirmation of\r\nreceipt to the Earth, and distribute them to the spacecraft subsystems.\r\n\r\nMariner II used four antennas in its communication system. A cone-like\r\nnondirectional (omni) antenna was mounted at the top of the spacecraft\r\nsuperstructure, and was used from injection into the Venus flight\r\ntrajectory through the midcourse maneuver (the directional antenna could\r\nnot be used until it had been oriented on the Earth).\r\n\r\nA dish-type, high-gain, directional antenna was used at Earth\r\norientation and after the trajectory correction maneuver was completed.\r\nIt could receive radio signals at greater distances than the\r\nnondirectional antenna. The directional antenna was nested beneath the\r\nhexagonal frame of the spacecraft while it was in the nose-cone shroud.\r\nFollowing the unfolding of the solar panels, it was swung into operating\r\nposition, although it was not used until after the spacecraft locked\r\nonto the Sun.\r\n\r\nThe directional antenna was equipped with flexible coaxial cables and a\r\nrotary joint. It could move in two directions; one motion was supplied\r\nby rolling the spacecraft around its long axis.\r\n\r\nIn addition, two command antennas, one on either side of one of the\r\nsolar panels, received radio commands from the Earth for the midcourse\r\nmaneuver and other functions.\r\n\r\n\r\nATTITUDE CONTROL: BALANCING IN SPACE\r\n\r\nMariner II had to maintain a delicate balance in its flight position\r\nduring the trip to Venus (like a tight-wire walker balancing with a\r\npole) in order to keep its solar panels locked onto the Sun and the\r\ndirectional antenna pointed at the Earth. Otherwise, both power and\r\ncommunications would have been lost.\r\n\r\nA system of gas jets and valves was used periodically to adjust the\r\nattitude or position of the spacecraft. Expulsion of nitrogen gas\r\nsupplied the force for these adjustments during the cruise mode. While\r\nthe spacecraft was subjected to the heavier disturbances caused by the\r\nrocket engine during the midcourse maneuver, the gas jets could not\r\nprovide enough power to control the attitude of the spacecraft and it\r\nwas necessary to use deflecting vanes as rudders in the rocket engine\r\nexhaust stream for stabilizing purposes.\r\n\r\nThe attitude control system was activated by CC&S command 60 minutes\r\nafter launching. It operated first to align the long axis of the\r\nspacecraft with the Sun; thus its solar panels would face the Sun.\r\nEither the Sun sensors or the three gyroscopes mounted in the pitch\r\n(rocking back and forth), yaw (side to side), and roll axes, could\r\nactivate the gas jet valves during the maneuver, which normally required\r\nabout 30 minutes to complete.\r\n\r\nThe spacecraft was allowed a pointing error of 1 degree in order to\r\nconserve gas. The system kept the spacecraft swinging through this 1\r\ndegree of arc approximately once each 60 minutes. As it neared the limit\r\non either side, the jets fired for approximately ¹/₅₀ of a second to\r\nstart the swing slowly in the other direction. Thus, Mariner rocked\r\nleisurely back and forth throughout its 4-month trip.\r\n\r\nSensitive photomultiplier tubes or electric eyes in the Earth sensor,\r\nmounted on the directional antenna, activated the gas jets to roll the\r\nspacecraft about the already fixed long axis in order to face the\r\nantenna toward the Earth. When the Earth was “acquired,” the antenna\r\nwould then necessarily be oriented in the proper direction. If telemetry\r\nrevealed that Mariner had accidentally fixed on the Moon, over-ride\r\nradio commands from the Earth could restart the orientation sequence.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROPULSION SYSTEM\r\n\r\nThe Mariner propulsion system for midcourse trajectory correction\r\nemployed a rocket engine that weighed 37 pounds with fuel and a nitrogen\r\npressure system, and developed 50 pounds of thrust for a maximum of 57\r\nseconds. The system was suspended within the central portion of the\r\nbasic hexagonal structure of the spacecraft.\r\n\r\nThis retro-rocket engine used a type of liquid propellant known as\r\nanhydrous hydrazine and it was so delicately controlled that it could\r\nburn for as little as ²/₁₀ of a second and increase the velocity of the\r\nspacecraft from as little as ⁷/₁₀ of a foot per second to as much as 200\r\nfeet per second.\r\n\r\nThe hydrazine fuel was stored in a rubber bladder inside a\r\ndoorknob-shaped container. At the ignition command, nitrogen gas under\r\n3,000-pound-per-square-inch pressure was forced into the propellant tank\r\nthrough explosively activated valves. The nitrogen then squeezed the\r\nrubber bladder, forcing the hydrazine into the combustion chamber.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _The midcourse propulsion system provides trajectory\r\n    correction for close approach to Venus._]\r\n\r\n  FUEL TANK\r\n  NITROGEN TANK\r\n  JET VANE ACTUATOR (ONE OF FOUR)\r\n  THRUST CHAMBER\r\n\r\nHydrazine, a monopropellant, requires a starting ignition for proper\r\ncombustion. In the Mariner system, nitrogen tetroxide starting or\r\n“kindling” fluid was injected into the propellant tank by a pressurized\r\ncartridge. Aluminum oxide pellets in the tank acted as catalysts to\r\ncontrol the speed of combustion of the hydrazine. The burning of the\r\nhydrazine was stopped when the flow of nitrogen gas was halted, also by\r\nexplosively activated valves.\r\n\r\n\r\nTEMPERATURE CONTROL\r\n\r\nMariner’s 129 days in space presented some unique problems in\r\ntemperature control. Engineers were faced with the necessity of\r\nachieving some form of thermal balance so that Mariner would become\r\nneither too hot nor too cold in the hostile environment of space.\r\n\r\nThe spacecraft’s temperature control system was made as thermally\r\nself-sufficient as possible. Paint patterns, aluminum sheet, thin gold\r\nplating, and polished aluminum surfaces reflected and absorbed the\r\nproper amount of heat necessary to keep the spacecraft and its\r\nsubsystems at the proper operating temperatures.\r\n\r\nThermal shields were used to protect the basic hexagon components. The\r\nupper shield, constructed of aluminized plastic on a fiberglass panel,\r\nprotected the top of the basic structure and was designed for maximum\r\nimmunity to ultraviolet radiation. The lower shield was installed below\r\nthe hexagon; it was made of aluminum plastic faced with aluminum foil\r\nwhere it was exposed to the blast of the midcourse rocket engine\r\nexhaust.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _Methods used to control the temperature of the\r\n    Mariner spacecraft in flight._]\r\n\r\n  CHROMATE CONVERSION COATING\r\n  UPPER THERMAL SHIELD\r\n  POLISHED ALUMINUM\r\n  LOUVERS\r\n  GOLD PLATE\r\n  BLACK PAINT\r\n  LOWER THERMAL SHIELD\r\n  WHITE PAINT\r\n\r\nThe six electronics cases on the hexagon structure were variously\r\ntreated, depending upon the power of the components contained in each.\r\nThose of high power were coated with a good radiating surface of white\r\npaint; assemblies of low power were provided with polished aluminum\r\nshields to minimize the heat loss.\r\n\r\nThe case housing the attitude control and CC&S electronics circuits was\r\nparticularly sensitive because the critical units might fail above 130\r\ndegrees F. A special assembly was mounted on the face of this case; it\r\nconsisted of eight movable, polished aluminum louvers, each actuated by\r\na coiled, temperature-sensitive, bimetallic element. When the\r\ntemperature rose, the elements acted as springs and opened the louvers.\r\nA drop in temperature would close them.\r\n\r\nStructures and bracket assemblies external to the basic hexagon were\r\ngold plated if made of magnesium, or polished if aluminum. Thus\r\nprotected, these items became poor thermal radiators as well as poor\r\nsolar absorbers, making them relatively immune to solar radiation.\r\nExternal cabling was wrapped in aluminized plastic to produce a similar\r\neffect.\r\n\r\nThe solar panels were painted on the shaded side for maximum radiation\r\ncontrol properties. Other items were designed so that the internal\r\nsurfaces were as efficient radiators as possible, thus conserving the\r\nspacecraft’s heat balance.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS\r\n\r\nFour instruments were operated throughout the cruise and encounter modes\r\nof Mariner: a magnetometer, a solar plasma detector, a cosmic dust\r\ndetector, and a combined charged-particle detector and radiation\r\ncounter. Two radiometers were used only in the immediate vicinity of\r\nVenus.\r\n\r\nThese instruments are described in detail in Chapter 8.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER 4\r\n                           THE LAUNCH VEHICLE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe motive power of Mariner itself was limited to a trajectory\r\ncorrection rocket engine and an ability, by means of gas jets, to keep\r\nits two critical faces pointing at the Sun and the Earth. Therefore, the\r\nspacecraft had to be boosted out of the Earth’s gravitational field and\r\ninjected into a flight path accurate enough to allow the trajectory\r\ncorrection system to alter the course to deliver the spacecraft close\r\nenough to Venus to be within operating range of the scientific\r\ninstruments.\r\n\r\nThe combined Atlas-Agena B booster system which was selected to do the\r\njob had a total thrust of about 376,000 pounds. With this power,\r\nAtlas-Agena could put 5,000 pounds of payload into a 345-mile orbit,\r\npropel 750 pounds on a lunar trajectory, or launch approximately 400\r\npounds on a planetary mission. This last capability would be taxed to\r\nthe limit by the 447 pounds of the Mariner spacecraft.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ATLAS BOOSTER: POWER OF SIX 707’S\r\n\r\nThe 360,000 pounds of thrust developed by the Atlas D missile is\r\nequivalent to the thrust generated by the engines of six Boeing 707 jet\r\nairplanes. All of this awesome power requires a gargantuan amount of\r\nfuel: in less than 20 seconds, Atlas consumes more than a\r\npropeller-driven, four-engine airplane burns in flying coast-to-coast\r\nnonstop.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _Photo courtesy of General Dynamics/Astronautics_\r\n    _This military version of the Atlas missile is modified for NASA\r\n    space flights._]\r\n\r\nThe Atlas missile, as developed by Convair for the Air Force, has a\r\nrange of 6,300 miles and reaches a top speed of 16,000 miles per hour.\r\nThe missile has been somewhat modified for use by NASA as a space\r\nbooster vehicle. Its mission was to lift the second-stage Agena B and\r\nthe Mariner spacecraft into the proper position and altitude at the\r\nright speed so that the Agena could go into Earth orbit, preliminary to\r\nthe takeoff for interplanetary space.\r\n\r\nThe Atlas D has two main sections: a body or sustainer section, and a\r\njettisonable aft, or booster engine section. The vehicle measures about\r\n100 feet in length (with military nose cone) and has a diameter of 10\r\nfeet at the base. The weight is approximately 275,000 pounds.\r\n\r\nNo aerodynamic control surfaces such as fins or rudders are used. The\r\nAtlas is stabilized and controlled by “gimbaling” or swiveling the\r\nengine thrust chambers by means of a hydraulic system. The direction of\r\nthrust can thus be altered to control the movements of the missile.\r\n\r\nThe aft section mounts two 154,500-pound-thrust booster engines and the\r\nentire section is jettisoned or separated from the sustainer section\r\nafter the booster engines burn out. The 60,000-pound-thrust sustainer\r\nengine is attached at the center line of the sustainer section. Two\r\n1,000-pound-thrust vernier (fine steering) engines are installed on\r\nopposite sides of the tank section in the yaw or side-turn plane.\r\n\r\nAll three groups of engines operate during the booster phase. Only the\r\nsustainer and the vernier engines burn after staging (when the booster\r\nengine section is separated from the sustainer section of the missile).\r\n\r\nAll of the engines use liquid oxygen and a liquid hydrocarbon fuel\r\n(RP-1) which is much like kerosene. Dual turbopumps and valves control\r\nthe flow of these propellants. The booster engine propellants are\r\ndelivered under pressure to the propellant or combustion chamber, where\r\nthey are ignited by electroexplosive devices. Each booster thrust\r\nchamber can be swiveled a maximum of 5 degrees in pitch (up and down)\r\nand yaw (from side to side) about the missile centerline.\r\n\r\nThe sustainer engine is deflected 3 degrees in pitch and yaw. The\r\noutboard vernier engines gimbal to permit pitch and roll movement\r\nthrough 140 degrees of arc, and yaw movement through 20 degrees toward\r\nthe missile body and 30 degrees outward.\r\n\r\nAll three groups of engines are started and develop their full rated\r\nthrust while the missile is held on the launch pad. After takeoff, the\r\nbooster engines burn out and are jettisoned. The sustainer engine\r\ncontinues to burn until its thrust is terminated. The swiveled vernier\r\nengines provide the final correction in velocity and missile attitude\r\nbefore they are also shut down.\r\n\r\nThe propellant tank is the basic structure of the forward or sustainer\r\nsection of the Atlas. It is made of thin stainless steel and is\r\napproximately 50 feet long. Internal pressure of helium gas is used to\r\nsupport the tank structure, thus eliminating the need for internal\r\nbracing structures, saving considerable weight, and increasing over-all\r\nperformance of the missile. The helium gas used for this purpose is\r\nexpanded to the proper pressure by heat from the engines.\r\n\r\nEquipment pods on the outside of the sustainer section house the\r\nelectrical and electronic units and other components of the missile\r\nsystems.\r\n\r\nThe Atlas uses a flight programmer, an autopilot, and the gimbaled\r\nengine thrust chamber actuators for flight control. The attitude of the\r\nvehicle is controlled by the autopilot, which is set for this automatic\r\nfunction before the flight. Guidance commands are furnished by a ground\r\nradio guidance system and computer.\r\n\r\nThe airborne radio inertial guidance system employs two radio beacons\r\nwhich respond to the ground radar. A decoder on board the missile\r\nprocesses the guidance commands.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE AGENA B: START AND RESTART\r\n\r\nLaunching Mariner to Venus required a second-stage vehicle capable of\r\ndriving the spacecraft out of Earth orbit and into a proper flight path\r\nto the planet.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _Photo courtesy of Lockheed Missiles and Space\r\n    Company_\r\n    _The Agena B second stage is hoisted to the top of the gantry at\r\n    AMR._]\r\n\r\nThe Agena B used for this purpose weighs 1,700 pounds, is 60 inches in\r\ndiameter, and has an over-all length of 25 feet, varying somewhat with\r\nthe payload. The Agena B fuel tanks are made of 0.080-inch aluminum\r\nalloy.\r\n\r\nThe liquid-burning engine develops more than 16,000 pounds of thrust.\r\nThe propellants are a form of hydrazine and red fuming nitric acid.\r\n\r\nThe Agena can be steered to a desired trajectory by swiveling the\r\ngimbal-mounted engine on command of the guidance system. The attitude of\r\nthe vehicle is controlled either by gimbaling the engine or by ejecting\r\ngas from pneumatic thrusters.\r\n\r\nThe Agena has the ability to restart its engine after it has already\r\nfired once to reach an Earth orbital speed. This feature makes possible\r\na significant increase in payload and a change of orbital altitude. A\r\nvelocity meter ends the first and second burns when predetermined\r\nvelocities have been reached.\r\n\r\nAfter engine cutoff, the major reorientation of the vehicle is achieved\r\nthrough gas jets controlled from an electronic programming device. This\r\nsystem can turn the Agena completely around in orbit, or pitch it down\r\nfor reentry into the atmosphere. The attitude is controlled by an\r\ninfrared, heat-sensitive horizon scanner and gyroscopes.\r\n\r\nThe principal modification to the Agena vehicle for the Mariner II\r\nmission was an alteration to the spacecraft-Agena adapter in order to\r\nreduce weight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER 5\r\n                           FLIGHT INTO SPACE\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the Mariner R Project officially activated in the fall of 1961 and\r\nthe launch vehicles selected, engineers proceeded at full speed to meet\r\nthe difficult launch schedule.\r\n\r\nA preliminary design was adopted in late September, when the scientific\r\nexperiments to be carried on board were also selected. By October 2, a\r\nschedule had been established that would deliver two spacecraft to the\r\nassembly building in Pasadena by January 15 and 29, 1962, respectively,\r\nwith the spares to follow in two weeks.\r\n\r\nDuring the week of November 6, tests were underway to determine problems\r\ninvolved in mating a mock-up of the spacecraft with the Agena shroud and\r\nadapter assembly. A thermal control model of the spacecraft had already\r\ngone into the small space simulator at JPL for preliminary temperature\r\ntests.\r\n\r\nMR-1, the first Mariner scheduled for flight, was in assembly\r\nimmediately after January 8, 1962, and the process was complete by the\r\nend of the month, when electrical and magnetic field tests had been\r\nstarted. At the same time, assembly of MR-2 was underway. Work on MR-1\r\nwas a week ahead of schedule by the end of the month.\r\n\r\nA full-scale temperature control model of the spacecraft went into the\r\nlarge space simulator on February 26. In mid-March, system tests began\r\non both spacecraft and it was decided that the flight hardware would be\r\ntested only in the small simulator, with the temperature control model\r\ncontinuing in the large chamber.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _Technician wears hood and protective goggles while\r\n    working on Mariner spacecraft in Space simulator chamber at Jet\r\n    Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena._]\r\n\r\nOn March 26, MR-1 was subjected to full-scale mating tests with the\r\nshroud (cover) and the adapter for mounting the spacecraft on top of the\r\nAgena. MR-2 was undergoing vibration tests during the week of April 16.\r\nBy April 30, MR-1 had completed vibration tests and had been mapped for\r\nmagnetic fields so that, once compensated for, they would not interfere\r\nwith the magnetometer experiment in space.\r\n\r\nA dummy run of MR-1 was conducted on May 7 and the spacecraft, space\r\nflight center, and computing equipment were put through a simulated\r\noperations test run during the same week.\r\n\r\nBy May 14, clean-up and final inspection by microscope had begun on\r\nMR-1, MR-2, and MR-3 (the latter spacecraft had been assembled from the\r\nspares). Soon after, the first two van loads of equipment were shipped\r\nto Cape Canaveral. The final system test of MR-1 was completed on May 21\r\nand the test of MR-2 followed during the same week.\r\n\r\nDuring the week of May 28, all three spacecraft and their associated\r\nground support equipment were packed, loaded, and shipped to the\r\nAtlantic Missile Range (AMR). At the same time, the Atlas designated to\r\nlaunch MR-1 went aboard a C-133 freight aircraft at San Diego. On the\r\nsame day, an Air Force order grounded all C-133’s for inspection and the\r\nplane did not depart until June 9.\r\n\r\nBy June 11, 1962, the firing dates had been established and both\r\nspacecraft were ready for launching. The Atlas booster had already been\r\nerected on the launch pad. The dummy run and a joint flight acceptance\r\ntest were completed on MR-1 during the week of July 2. Final flight\r\npreparations and system test of MR-1 and the system test of MR-2 were\r\nconcluded a week later.\r\n\r\nThus, in 324 days, a new spacecraft project had been activated; the\r\ndesign, assembly, and testing had been completed; and the infinite\r\nnumber of decisions pertaining to launch, AMR Range Operations,\r\ndeep-space tracking, and data processing activities had been made and\r\nimplemented.\r\n\r\nVenus was approaching the Earth at the end of its 19-month excursion\r\naround the Sun. The launch vehicles and Mariners I and II stood ready to\r\ngo from Canaveral’s Launch Complex 12. The events leading to the first\r\nclose-up look at Venus and intervening space were about to reach their\r\nfirst crisis: a fiery explosion over the Atlantic Ocean.\r\n\r\n\r\nMARINER I: AN ABORTIVE LAUNCH\r\n\r\nAfter 570 hours of testing, Mariner I was poised on top of the\r\nAtlas-Agena launch vehicle during the night of July 20, 1962. The time\r\nwas right, the Range and the tracking net were standing by, the launch\r\nvehicles were ready to cast off the spacecraft for Venus.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _Atlas for launching Mariner II arrives at Cape\r\n    Canaveral in C-133 aircraft._]\r\n\r\nThe countdown was begun at 11:33 p.m., EST, July 20, after several\r\ndelays because of trouble in the Range Safety Command system. At the\r\ntime, the launch count stood at T minus 176 minutes—if all went well,\r\n176 minutes until the booster engines were ignited.\r\n\r\nAnother hold again delayed the count until 12:37 a.m., July 21, when\r\ncounting was resumed at T minus 165 minutes. The count then proceeded\r\nwithout incident to T minus 79 minutes at 2:20 a.m., when uncertainty\r\nover the cause of a blown fuse in the Range Safety circuits caused the\r\noperations to be “scrubbed” or cancelled for the night. The next launch\r\nattempt was scheduled for July 21-22.\r\n\r\nThe second launch countdown for Mariner I began shortly before midnight,\r\nJuly 21. Spacecraft power had been turned on at 11:08 p.m., with the\r\nlaunch count at T minus 200 minutes. At T minus 135 minutes, the weather\r\nlooked good. A 41-minute hold was required at minus 130 minutes (12:17\r\na.m., July 22) in order to change a noisy component in the ground\r\ntracking system.\r\n\r\nWhen counting was resumed at T minus 130 minutes, the clock read 12:48\r\na.m. A previously scheduled hold was called at T minus 60 minutes,\r\nlasting from 1:58 to 2:38 a.m. The good weather still held.\r\n\r\nAt T minus 80 seconds, power fluctuations in the radio guidance system\r\nforced a 34-minute hold. Time was resumed at 4:16 a.m., when the\r\ncountdown was set back to T minus 5 minutes.\r\n\r\nAt exactly 4:21.23 a.m., EST, the Atlas thundered to life and lifted off\r\nthe pad, bearing its Venus-bound load. The boost phase looked good until\r\nthe Range Safety officer began to notice an unscheduled yaw-left\r\n(northeast) maneuver. By 4:25 a.m., it was evident that, if allowed to\r\ncontinue, the vehicle might crash in the North Atlantic shipping lanes\r\nor in some inhabited area. Steering commands were being supplied but\r\nfaulty application of the guidance equations was taking the vehicle far\r\noff course.\r\n\r\nFinally, at 4:26.16 a.m., after 293 seconds of flight and with just 6\r\nseconds left before separation of the Atlas and Agena—after which the\r\nlaunch vehicle could not be destroyed—a Range Safety officer hit the\r\n“destruct” button.\r\n\r\nA flash of light illuminated the sky and the choppy Atlantic waters were\r\nawash with the glowing death of a space probe. Even as it fluttered down\r\nto the sea, however, the radio transponder of the shattered Mariner I\r\ncontinued to transmit for 1 minute and 4 seconds after the destroy\r\ncommand had been sent.\r\n\r\nMariner I did not succumb easily.\r\n\r\n\r\nMARINER II: A ROLL BEFORE PARKING\r\n\r\nEver since Mariner II had arrived at the Cape on June 4, test teams of\r\nall organizations had labored day and night to prepare the spacecraft\r\nfor launch. The end of their efforts culminated after some 690 hours of\r\ntest time, both in California and in Florida.\r\n\r\nThirty-five days after Mariner I met its explosive end, the first\r\ncountdown on Mariner II was underway. At 6:43 p.m., EST, August 25,\r\n1962, time was picked up. The countdown did not proceed far, however.\r\nThe Atlas crew asked for a hold at T minus 205 minutes (8:39 p.m.)\r\nbecause of stray voltages in the command destruct system caused by a\r\ndefective Agena battery. After considerable delay, the launch effort was\r\nscrubbed at 10:06 p.m.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _Two assembly operations and system checkouts are\r\n    performed separated by a trip to the pad to verify compatibility\r\n    with the launch vehicle_]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _A complete electronic checkout station in the hangar\r\n    supports the spacecraft to ensure operability_]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _Mariner takes form as the solar panels are attached\r\n    and the final hangar checkout operations are performed before the\r\n    launch._]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _Wrapped in a dust cover, the spacecraft is\r\n    transferred from Hangar AE at AMR to the explosive safe area for\r\n    further tests._]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _Inside the bunker-like explosive safe area, the\r\n    powerful midcourse maneuver rocket engine is installed in the center\r\n    of the spacecraft._]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _Final assembly and inspection complete, Mariner is\r\n    “canned” in the nose shroud that will protect it through the Earth’s\r\n    atmosphere and into space._]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _At the pad, the shrouded spacecraft is lifted past\r\n    the Atlas ..._]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _... and the Agena._]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _Twelfth floor: Mariner reaches its mating level._]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _The spacecraft is eased over to the top of the Agena\r\n    ..._]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _... and carefully mated to it._]\r\n\r\nThe second launch attempt started at 6:37 p.m., August 26, with the\r\nAtlas-Agena B and Mariner II ready on the pad. At 9:52 p.m., T minus 100\r\nminutes, a 40-minute hold was called to replace the Atlas main battery.\r\nBy 10:37, with 95 minutes to launch, all spacecraft systems were ready\r\nto go.\r\n\r\nA routine hold at T minus 60 minutes was extended beyond 30 minutes in\r\norder to verify the spacecraft battery life expectation. At 11:48 p.m.,\r\nwith the count standing at T minus 55 minutes, the spacecraft, the\r\nvehicles, the Range, and the DSIF were all given the green light.\r\n\r\nWhen good launching weather was reported at 12:18 a.m., August 27, just\r\n25 minutes from liftoff, a cautious optimism began to mount in the\r\nblockhouse and among the tired crews.\r\n\r\nBut the tension began to build again. The second prescheduled hold at T\r\nminus 5 minutes was extended beyond a half-hour when the radio guidance\r\nsystem had difficulty with ground station power. Counting was “picked\r\nup” and the clock continued to move down to 60 seconds before liftoff.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, the radio guidance system was in trouble again. Fluctuations\r\nshowed in its rate beacon signals, and another hold was called. Still\r\nanother hold for the same reason followed at T minus 50 seconds. This\r\ntime, at 1:30 a.m., the count was set back to T minus 5 minutes.\r\n\r\nOne further crisis developed during this hold—only 3 minutes of\r\npre-launch life remained in Atlas’ main battery. A quick decision was\r\nmade to hold the switchover to missile power until T minus 60 seconds to\r\nhelp conserve the life of the battery.\r\n\r\nAt 1:48 a.m., the count was resumed again at T minus 5 minutes. The long\r\nseconds began to drag. Finally, the Convair test director pressed the\r\nfire button.\r\n\r\nOut on the launch pad, the Atlas engines ignited with a white puff and\r\nbegan to strain against the retaining bolts as 360,000 pounds of thrust\r\nbegan to build up. In a holocaust of noise and flame, the Atlas was\r\nreleased and lifted off the launch pad on a bearing of 106.8 degrees at\r\nexactly 1 hour, 53 minutes, 13.927 seconds in the morning of August 27,\r\n1962.\r\n\r\nMariner II was on its way to listen to the music of the spheres.\r\n\r\nAs the launch vehicle roared up into the night sky, the JPL Launch\r\nCheckout Station (DSIF O) tracked the spacecraft until Mariner\r\ndisappeared over the horizon. A quick, preliminary evaluation of\r\nspacecraft data showed normal readings and Atlas seemed to be flying a\r\ntrue course. The AMR in-flight data transmission and computational\r\noperations were being performed as expected. With liftoff out of the\r\nway, the launch began to look good.\r\n\r\nAfter the radio signal from the ground guidance system cut off the\r\nengines and the booster section was jettisoned, the remaining Atlas\r\nforward section, plus the Agena and the spacecraft began to roll.\r\nHowever, it stabilized itself in a normal attitude. Although the Atlas\r\nhad not gone out of the Range Safety restrictions, it was within just 3\r\ndegrees of exceeding the Agena horizon sensor limits, which would have\r\nforced another aborted mission.\r\n\r\nAfter the booster separation, the Atlas sustainer and vernier engines\r\ncontinued to burn until they were shut off by radio guidance command.\r\nShortly thereafter, spring-loaded bolts ejected the nose-cone shroud\r\nwhich had protected the spacecraft against frictional heating in the\r\natmosphere. Simultaneously, the gyroscopes in the Agena were started\r\nand, at about 1:58 a.m., the Agena and the spacecraft separated from the\r\nnow-spent Atlas, which was retarded by small retro-rockets and drifted\r\nback into the atmosphere, where it was destroyed by friction on reentry.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PARKING ORBIT\r\n\r\nAs the Agena separated from the Atlas booster vehicle, it was programmed\r\nto pitch down almost 15 degrees, putting it roughly parallel with the\r\nlocal horizon. Then, following a brief coasting period, the Agena engine\r\nignited at 1:58.53 a.m. and fired until 2:01.12 a.m. Cut-off occurred at\r\na predetermined value of velocity. Both the Agena and the spacecraft had\r\nnow reached a speed of approximately 18,000 miles per hour and had gone\r\ninto an Earth orbit at an altitude of 116.19 statute miles.\r\n\r\nThe second stage and the spacecraft were now in a “parking orbit,” which\r\nwould allow the vehicle to coast out to a point more favorable than Cape\r\nCanaveral for blasting off Mariner for Venus.\r\n\r\nDuring the launch, Cape radar had tracked the radar beacon on the Agena,\r\nlosing it on the horizon at 2:00.53 a.m. Radar stations at Grand Bahama\r\nIsland, San Salvador, Ascension, the Twin Falls Victory ship, and\r\nPretoria (in South Africa) continued to track down range. Meanwhile,\r\nAntigua had “locked on” and tracked the spacecraft’s radio transponder\r\nand telemetry from 1:58 to 2:08 a.m. when it went over the Antigua\r\nhorizon.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _Mariner II is accelerated to Earth-escape velocity\r\n    and out of orbit near St. Helena.

EXPEL UNUSED AGENA PROPELLANT\r\n\r\nThe second coasting period lasted 16.3 minutes, a time determined by the\r\nground guidance computer and transmitted to the Agena during the vernier\r\nburning period of Atlas. Then, Agena restarted its engine and fired for\r\na second time. At the end of this firing period, both the Agena and\r\nMariner, still attached, had been injected into a transfer trajectory to\r\nVenus at a velocity exceeding that required to escape from the Earth’s\r\ngravity.\r\n\r\nThe actual injection into space occurred at 26 minutes 3.08 seconds\r\nafter liftoff from the Cape (2:19.19 a.m., EST) at a point above 14.873\r\ndegrees south latitude and 2.007 degrees west longitude. Thus, Mariner\r\nmade the break for Venus about 360 miles northeast of St. Helena, 2,500\r\nmiles east of the Brazilian coast, and about 900 miles west of Angola on\r\nthe west African shore.\r\n\r\nDuring injection, the vehicle was being tracked by Ascension, telemetry\r\nship Twin Falls Victory, and Pretoria. Telemetry ship Whiskey secured\r\nthe spacecraft signal just after injection and tracked until 2:26 a.m.\r\nPretoria began its telemetry track at 2:21 and continued to track for\r\nalmost two hours, until 4:19 a.m.\r\n\r\nInjection velocity was 7.07 miles per second or 25,420 miles per hour,\r\njust beyond Earth-escape speed. The distance at the time of injection\r\nfrom Canaveral’s Launch Complex 12 was 4,081.3 miles.\r\n\r\nThe Agena and Mariner flew the escape path together for another two\r\nminutes after injection before they were separated at 2:21 a.m. Agena\r\nthen performed a 140-degree yaw or retro-turn maneuver by expelling\r\nunused propellants. The purpose was to prevent the unsterilized Agena\r\nfrom possibly hitting the planet, and from following Mariner too closely\r\nand perhaps disturbing its instruments.\r\n\r\nNow, Mariner II was flying alone and clear. Ahead lay a journey of 109\r\ndays and more than 180 million miles.\r\n\r\n\r\nORIENTATION AND MIDCOURSE MANEUVER\r\n\r\nAs Mariner II headed into space, the Deep Space Instrumentation Facility\r\n(DSIF) network began to track the spacecraft. At 2:23.59 a.m., DSIF 5 at\r\nJohannesburg, aided by the Mobile Tracking Station, installed in vans in\r\nthe vicinity, was “looking” at the spacecraft, just four minutes after\r\ninjection.\r\n\r\nJohannesburg was able to track Mariner until 4:04 p.m. because, as the\r\ntrajectory took Mariner almost radially away from the Earth, our planet\r\nbegan in effect to turn away from under the spacecraft. On an Earth map,\r\nbecause of its course and the rotation of the Earth, Mariner II appeared\r\nto describe a great arc over the Indian Ocean far to the west of\r\nAustralia, then to turn north and west and to proceed straight west over\r\nsouth-central Africa, across the Atlantic, and over the Amazon Basin of\r\nnorthern South America. Johannesburg finally lost track at a point over\r\nthe middle of South America.\r\n\r\nWhile swinging over the Indian Ocean on its first pass, the spacecraft\r\nwas acquired by Woomera’s DSIF 4 at 2:42.30 a.m., and tracked until 8:08\r\na.m., when Mariner was passing just to the north of Madagascar on a\r\nwesterly course. Goldstone did not acquire the spacecraft until it was\r\napproaching the east coast of South America at 3:12 p.m., August 27.\r\n\r\nWith Mariner slowly tumbling in free space, it was now necessary to\r\ninitiate a series of events to place the spacecraft in the proper flight\r\nposition. At 2:27 a.m., 44 minutes after launch, the Mariner Central\r\nComputer and Sequencer (CC&S) on board the spacecraft issued a command\r\nfor explosively activated pin pullers to release the solar panels and\r\nthe radiometer dish from their launch-secured positions. At 2:53, 60\r\nminutes after liftoff, the attitude control system was turned on and the\r\nSun orientation sequence began with the extension of the directional\r\nantenna to a preset angle of 72 degrees.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _Mariner II was launched while Venus was far behind\r\n    the Earth. During the 109-day flight, Venus overtook and passed the\r\n    Earth. It rendezvoused with the spacecraft at a point about\r\n    36,000,000 miles from the Earth._]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _During the midcourse maneuver, the trajectory of\r\n    Mariner II was corrected so that the spacecraft would approach\r\n    within 21,598 miles of Venus._]\r\n\r\n  ROLL MANEUVER ANTENNA UP\r\n  PITCH MANEUVER\r\n  MOTOR BURN\r\n  SUN REAQUISITION ANTENNA REPOSITION\r\n  EARTH REAQUISITION\r\n\r\nThe Sun sensors then activated the gas jets and moved the spacecraft\r\nabout until the roll or long axis was pointed at the Sun. This maneuver\r\nrequired only 2½ minutes after the CC&S issued the command. The solar\r\npanel power output of 195 watts was somewhat higher than anticipated, as\r\nwere the spacecraft temperatures, which decreased and stabilized six\r\nhours after the spacecraft oriented itself on the Sun.\r\n\r\nOn August 29, a command from Johannesburg turned on the cruise\r\nscientific experiments, including all the instruments except the two\r\nradiometers. The rate of data transmission was then observed to decrease\r\nas planned and the data conditioning system was functioning normally.\r\n\r\nFor seven days, no attempt was made to orient the spacecraft with\r\nrespect to the Earth because the Earth sensors were too sensitive to\r\noperate properly at such a close range. On September 3, the CC&S\r\ninitiated the Earth acquisition sequence. The gyroscopes were turned on,\r\nthe cruise scientific instruments were temporarily switched off, and a\r\nsearch for the Earth began about the roll axis of the spacecraft.\r\n\r\nDuring this maneuver, the long axis of the spacecraft was held steady in\r\na position pointing at the Sun and the gas jets rolled the spacecraft\r\naround this axis until the sensors, mounted in the directional antenna,\r\ncould “see” the Earth. Apparently, the Earth sensor was already viewing\r\nthe Earth because the transmitter output immediately switched from the\r\nomni- to the directional antenna, indicating that no search was\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\nHowever, the initial brightness reading from the Earth sensor was 38, an\r\nintensity that might be expected if the spacecraft were locked onto the\r\nMoon instead of the Earth. As a result, the midcourse maneuver was\r\ndelayed until verification of Earth lock was obtained.\r\n\r\nMariner’s injection into the Venus trajectory yielded a predicted miss\r\nof 233,000 miles in front of the planet, well within the normal miss\r\npattern expected as a result of the launch. Because the spacecraft was\r\ndesigned to cross the orbit of Venus behind the planet and pass between\r\nit and the Sun, it was necessary to correct the trajectory to an\r\napproximate 8,000- to 40,000-mile “fly-by” so the scientific instruments\r\ncould operate within their design ranges.\r\n\r\nAfter comparison of the actual flight path with that required for a\r\nproper near-miss, the necessary roll, pitch, and motor-burn commands\r\nwere generated by the JPL computers. When, on September 4, it had been\r\nestablished that the spacecraft was indeed oriented on the Earth and not\r\nthe Moon, a set of three commands was transmitted to the spacecraft from\r\nGoldstone, to be stored in the electronic “memory unit” until the start\r\ncommand was sent.\r\n\r\nAt 1:30 p.m., PST, the first commands were transmitted: a 9.33-degree\r\nroll turn, a 139.83-degree pitch turn, and a motor-burn command to\r\nproduce a 69.5-mile-per-hour velocity change.\r\n\r\nAt 2:39 p.m., a fourth command was sent to switch from the directional\r\nantenna to the omni-antenna. Finally, a command went out instructing the\r\nspacecraft to proceed with the now “memorized” maneuver program.\r\n\r\nMariner then turned off the Earth and Sun sensors, moved the directional\r\nantenna out of the path of the rocket exhaust stream, and executed a\r\n9.33-degree roll turn in 51 seconds.\r\n\r\nNext, the pitch turn was completed in 13¼ minutes, turning the\r\nspacecraft almost completely around so the motor nozzle would point in\r\nthe correct direction when fired.\r\n\r\nThe spacecraft was stabilized and the roll and pitch turns controlled by\r\ngyroscopes, which signalled the attitude control system the rate of\r\ncorrection for comparison with the already computed values.\r\n\r\nWith the solar panels no longer directly oriented on the Sun, the\r\nbattery began to share the power demand and finally carried the entire\r\nload until the spacecraft had again been oriented on the Sun.\r\n\r\nAt the proper time, the motor—controlled by the CC&S—ignited and burned\r\nfor 27.8 seconds, while the spacecraft’s acceleration was compared with\r\nthe predetermined values by the accelerometer. During this period, when\r\nthe gas jets could not operate properly, the spacecraft was stabilized\r\nby movable vanes or rudders in the exhaust of the midcourse motor.\r\n\r\nThe velocity added by the midcourse motor resulted in a decrease of the\r\nrelative speed of the spacecraft with respect to the Earth by 59 miles\r\nper hour (from 6,748 to 6,689 miles per hour), while the speed relative\r\nto the Sun increased by 45 miles per hour (from 60,117 to 60,162 miles\r\nper hour).\r\n\r\nThis apparently paradoxical condition occurred because, in order to\r\nintercept Venus, Mariner had been launched in a direction opposite to\r\nthe Earth’s course around the Sun. The midcourse maneuver turned the\r\nspacecraft around and slowed its travel away from the Earth while\r\nallowing it to increase its speed around the Sun in the direction of the\r\nEarth’s orbit. Gradually, then, the spacecraft would begin to fall in\r\ntoward the Sun while moving in the same direction as the Earth, catching\r\nand passing the Earth on the 65th day and intersecting Venus’ orbit on\r\nthe 109th day.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the midcourse maneuver, the spacecraft was travelling\r\nslightly inside the Earth’s orbit by 70,000 miles, and was behind the\r\nEarth by 1,492,500 miles.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LONG CRUISE\r\n\r\nAfter its completion of the midcourse maneuver, Mariner reoriented\r\nitself on the Sun in 7 minutes and on the Earth in about 30 minutes.\r\nDuring the midcourse maneuver, the omnidirectional antenna was used;\r\nnow, with the maneuver completed, the directional antenna was switched\r\nback in for the duration of the mission.\r\n\r\nEver since the spacecraft had left the parking orbit near the Earth and\r\nbeen injected into the Venus trajectory, the Space Flight Operations\r\nCenter back in Pasadena had been the nerve center of the mission.\r\nTelemetered data had been coming in from the DSIF stations on a 24-hour\r\nschedule. During the cruise phase, from September 5 to December 7, a\r\ntotal of 16 orbit computations were made to perfect the planet encounter\r\nprediction. On December 7, the first noticeable Venus-caused effects on\r\nMariner’s trajectory were observed, causing a definite deviation of the\r\nspacecraft’s flight path.\r\n\r\nOn September 8, at 12:50 p.m., EST, the spacecraft lost its attitude\r\ncontrol, which caused the power serving the scientific instruments to\r\nswitch off and the gyroscopes to switch on automatically for\r\napproximately three minutes, after which normal operation was resumed.\r\nThe cause was not apparent but the chances of a strike by some small\r\nspace object seemed good.\r\n\r\nAs a result of this event, a significant difference in the apparent\r\nbrightness reading of the Earth sensor was noted. This sensor had been\r\ncausing concern for some time because its readings had decreased to\r\nalmost zero. Further decrease, if actually caused by the instrument and\r\nnot by the telemetry sensing elements, could result in loss of Earth\r\nlock and the failure of radio contact.\r\n\r\nAfter the incident of September 8, the Earth sensor brightness reading\r\nincreased from 6 to 63, a normal indication for that day. Thereafter,\r\nthis measurement decreased in an expected manner as the spacecraft\r\nincreased its distance from the Earth.\r\n\r\nMariner II was now embarked on the long cruise. On September 12, the\r\ndistance from the Earth was 2,678,960 miles and the spacecraft speed\r\nrelative to the Earth was 6,497 miles per hour. Mariner was accelerating\r\nits speed as the Sun’s gravity began to exert a stronger pull than the\r\nEarth’s. On October 3, Mariner was nearly 6 million miles out and moving\r\nat 6,823 miles per hour relative to the Earth. A total of 55,600,000\r\nmiles had been covered to that point.\r\n\r\nConsiderable anxiety had developed at JPL when Mariner’s Earth sensor\r\nreading had fallen off so markedly. This situation was relieved by the\r\nunexplained return to normal on September 8, although the day-to-day\r\nchange in the brightness number was watched closely. The apparent\r\nability of the spacecraft to recover its former performance after the\r\nloss of attitude control on September 8 and again on September 29 was an\r\nencouraging sign.\r\n\r\nAnother disturbing event occurred on October 31, when the output from\r\none solar panel deteriorated abruptly. The entire power load was thrown\r\non the other panel, which was then dangerously near its maximum rated\r\noutput. To alleviate this situation, the cruise scientific instruments\r\nwere turned off. A week later, the malfunctioning panel returned to\r\nnormal operation and the science instruments were again turned on.\r\nAlthough the trouble had cleared temporarily, it developed again on\r\nNovember 15 and never again corrected itself. The diagnosis was a\r\npartial short circuit between one string of solar cells and the panel\r\nframe, but by now the spacecraft was close enough to the Sun so that one\r\npanel supplied enough power.\r\n\r\nBy October 24, the spacecraft was 10,030,000 miles from the Earth and\r\nwas moving at 10,547 miles per hour relative to the Earth. The distance\r\nfrom Venus was now 21,266,000 miles.\r\n\r\nOctober 30 was the 65th day of the mission and at 5 a.m., PST, Mariner\r\novertook and passed the Earth at a distance of 11,500,000 miles. Since\r\nthe spacecraft’s direction of travel had, in effect, been reversed by\r\nthe midcourse maneuver, it had been gaining on the Earth in the\r\ndirection of its orbit, although constantly falling away from the Earth\r\nin the direction of the Sun.\r\n\r\nThe point of equal distance between the Earth and Venus was passed on\r\nNovember 6, when Mariner was 13,900,000 miles from both planets and\r\ntravelling at 13,843 miles per hour relative to the Earth. As November\r\nwore on, hope for a successful mission began to mount. Using tracking\r\ndata rather than assumptions of standard midcourse performance, the\r\nVenus miss distance had now been revised to about 21,000 miles and\r\nencounter was predicted for December 14. But the DSIF tracking crews,\r\nthe space flight and computer operators, and the management staff could\r\nnot yet relax. The elation following the successful trajectory\r\ncorrection maneuver on September 4 had given way alternately to\r\ndiscouragement and guarded optimism.\r\n\r\nFour telemetry measurements were lost on December 9 and never returned\r\nto normal. They measured the angle of the antenna hinge, the fuel tank\r\npressure, and the nitrogen pressure in the midcourse and attitude\r\ncontrol systems. A blown fuse, designed to protect the data encoder from\r\nshort circuits in the sensors, was suspected. However, these channels\r\ncould not affect spacecraft operation and Mariner continued to perform\r\nnormally.\r\n\r\nThe rising temperatures recorded on the spacecraft were more serious.\r\nOnly the solar panels were displaying expected temperature readings;\r\nsome of the others were as much as 75 degrees above the values predicted\r\nfor Venus encounter. The heat increase became more rapid after November\r\n20. By December 12, six of the temperature sensors had reached their\r\nupper limits. It was feared that the failure point of the equipment\r\nmight be exceeded.\r\n\r\nThe CC&S performed without incident until just before encounter, when,\r\nfor the first time, it failed to yield certain pulses. JPL engineers\r\nwere worried about the starting of the encounter sequence, due the next\r\nday, although they knew that Earth-based radio could send these\r\ncommands, if necessary.\r\n\r\nOn December 12, with the climax of the mission near, the spacecraft was\r\n34,218,000 miles from the Earth, with a speed away from the Earth of\r\n35,790 miles per hour, a Sun-relative speed of 83,900 miles per hour.\r\n\r\nOnly 635,525 miles from Venus at this point, Mariner II was closing fast\r\non the cloud-shrouded planet. But it was a hot spacecraft that was\r\ncarrying its load of inquisitive instruments to the historic encounter.\r\n\r\n\r\nENCOUNTER AND BEYOND\r\n\r\nOn its 109th day of travel, Mariner had approached Venus in a precarious\r\ncondition. Seven of the over-heated temperature sensors had reached\r\ntheir upper telemetry limits. The Earth-sensor brightness reading stood\r\nat 3 (0 was the nominal threshold) and was dropping. Some 149 watts of\r\npower were being consumed out of the 165 watts still available from the\r\ncrippled solar panels.\r\n\r\nAt JPL’s Space Flight Operations Center, there was reason to believe\r\nthat the ailing CC&S might not command the spacecraft into its encounter\r\nsequence at the proper time. Twelve hours before encounter, these fears\r\nwere verified.\r\n\r\nQuickly, the emergency Earth-originated command was prepared for\r\ntransmission. At 5:35 a.m., PST, a radio signal went out from\r\nGoldstone’s Echo Station. Thirty-six million miles away, Mariner II\r\nresponded to the tiny pulse of energy from the Earth and began its\r\nencounter sequence.\r\n\r\nAfter Mariner had “acknowledged” receipt of the command from the Earth,\r\nthe spacecraft switched into the encounter sequence as engineering data\r\nwere turned off and the radiometers began their scanning motion, taking\r\nup-and-down readings across the face of the planet. As throughout the\r\nlong cruise, the four experiments monitoring the magnetic fields, cosmic\r\ndust, charged particles, and solar plasma experiments continued to\r\noperate.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _Mariner II approached Venus from the dark side,\r\n    crossed between the planet and the Sun while making three radiometer\r\n    scans of the disk._]\r\n\r\nAs Mariner approached Venus on its night side, it was travelling about\r\n88,400 miles per hour with respect to the Sun. At the point of closest\r\napproach, at 11:59.28 a.m., PST, the distance from the planet was 21,598\r\nmiles.\r\n\r\nDuring encounter with Venus, three scans were made: one on the dark\r\nside, one across the terminator dividing dark and sunlit sides, and one\r\non the sunlit side. Although the scan went slightly beyond the edge of\r\nthe planet, the operation proceeded smoothly and good data were received\r\non the Earth.\r\n\r\nWith encounter completed, the cruise condition was reestablished by\r\nradio command from the Earth and the spacecraft returned to transmitting\r\nengineering data, together with the continuing readings of the four\r\ncruise scientific experiments.\r\n\r\nAfter approaching closer to a planet and making more meaningful\r\nscientific measurements than any man-made space probe, Mariner II\r\ncontinued on into an orbit around the Sun.\r\n\r\nDecember 27, 13 days after Venus encounter, marked the perihelion, or\r\npoint of Mariner’s closest approach to the Sun: 65,505,935 miles. The\r\nSun-related speed was 89,442 miles per hour. As Mariner began to pull\r\naway from the Sun in the following months, its Sun-referenced speed\r\nwould decrease.\r\n\r\nData were still being received during these final days and the Earth and\r\nSun lock were still being maintained. Although the antenna hinge angle\r\nwas no longer being automatically readjusted by the spacecraft, commands\r\nwere sent from the Earth in an attempt to keep the antenna pointed at\r\nthe Earth, even if the Earth sensor were no longer operating properly.\r\n\r\nAt 2 a.m., EST, January 3, 1963, 20 days after passing Venus, Mariner\r\nfinished transmitting 30 minutes of telemetry data to Johannesburg and\r\nthe station shut down its operation. When Woomera’s DSIF 4 later made a\r\nnormal search for the spacecraft signal, it could not be found.\r\nGoldstone also searched in vain for the spacecraft transmissions, but\r\napparently Mariner’s voice had at last died, although the spacecraft\r\nwould go into an eternal orbit around the Sun.\r\n\r\nIt was estimated that Mariner’s aphelion (farthest point out) in its\r\norbit around the Sun would occur on June 18, 1963, at a distance of\r\n113,813,087 miles. Maximum distance from the Earth would be 98,063,599\r\nmiles on March 30, 1963; closest approach to the Earth: 25,765,717 miles\r\non September 27, 1963.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RECORD OF MARINER\r\n\r\nThe performance record of Mariner II exceeded that of any spacecraft\r\npreviously launched from Earth:\r\n\r\n\r\n—It performed the first and most distant trajectory-correcting maneuver\r\n  in deep space, firing a rocket motor at the greatest distance from the\r\n  Earth: 1,492,000 miles (September 4, 1962).\r\n\r\n—The spacecraft transmitted continuously for four months, sending back\r\n  to the Earth some 90 million bits of information while using only 3\r\n  watts of transmitted power.\r\n\r\n—Useful telemetry measurements were made at another record distance from\r\n  the Earth: 53.9 million miles (January 3, 1963).\r\n\r\n—Mariner II was the first spacecraft to operate in the immediate\r\n  vicinity of another planet and return useful scientific information to\r\n  the Earth: approximately 21,598 miles from Venus (December 14, 1962).\r\n\r\n—Measurements were made closest to the Sun: 65.3 million miles away\r\n  (December 27, 1962).\r\n\r\n—Mariner’s communication system operated for the longest continuous\r\n  period in interplanetary space: 129 days (August 27, 1962, to January\r\n  3, 1963).\r\n\r\n—Mariner achieved the longest continuous operation of a spacecraft\r\n  attitude-stabilization system in space, and at a greater distance from\r\n  the Earth than any previous spacecraft: 129 days (August 27, 1962, to\r\n  January 3, 1963), at 53.9 million miles from the Earth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER 6\r\n                          THE TRACKING NETWORK\r\n\r\n\r\nThirty-six million miles separated the Earth from Venus at encounter.\r\nCommunicating with Mariner II and tracking it out to this distance, and\r\nbeyond, represented a tremendous extension of man’s ability to probe\r\ninterplanetary space.\r\n\r\nThe problem involved:\r\n\r\n  1. The establishment of the spacecraft’s velocity and position\r\n          relative to the Earth, Venus, and the Sun with high precision.\r\n  2. The transmission of commands to activate spacecraft maneuvers.\r\n  3. The reception of readable spacecraft engineering and scientific\r\n          data from the far-ranging Mariner.\r\n\r\nThe tracking network had to contend with many radio noise sources: the\r\nnoise from the solar system and from extragalactic origins; noise\r\noriginating from the Earth and its atmosphere; and the inherent\r\ninterference originating in the receiving equipment. These problems were\r\nsolved by using advanced high-gain antennas and ultra-stable, extremely\r\nsensitive receiving equipment.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEEP SPACE INSTRUMENTATION FACILITY\r\n\r\nThe National Aeronautics and Space Administration has constructed a\r\nnetwork of deep-space tracking stations for lunar and planetary\r\nexploration missions. In order to provide continuous, 24-hour coverage,\r\nthree stations were built, approximately 120 degrees of longitude apart,\r\naround the world: at Goldstone in the California desert, near\r\nJohannesburg in South Africa, and at Woomera in the south-central\r\nAustralian desert.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _The three tracking stations of the Deep Space\r\n    Instrumentation Facility are located around the world so as to\r\n    provide continuous flight coverage._]\r\n\r\nThese stations are the basic elements of the Deep Space Instrumentation\r\nFacility (DSIF). In addition, a mobile tracking station installed in\r\nvans is used near the point of injection of a spacecraft into an\r\nEarth-escape trajectory to assist the permanent stations in finding the\r\nspacecraft and to acquire tracking data. The control point for the DSIF\r\nnet is located at JPL in Pasadena, California (see Table 1).\r\n\r\nThe Jet Propulsion Laboratory has the responsibility for the technical\r\ndirection of the entire DSIF net and operates the Goldstone facilities\r\nwith assistance from the Bendix Corporation as a subcontractor. The\r\noverseas stations are staffed and operated by agencies of the Republic\r\nof South Africa and the Commonwealth of Australia.\r\n\r\nThe DSIF net tracks the position and velocity of U.S. deep-space probes,\r\nissues commands to direct the spacecraft in flight, receives engineering\r\nand scientific data from the probes, and automatically relays the data\r\nto JPL in Pasadena, where it is processed by computers and interpreted.\r\n(In the tracking operation, a signal is transmitted to the spacecraft,\r\nwhere it is received and processed in a transponder, which then sends\r\nthe signal back to the Earth. The change in frequency, known as the\r\ndoppler effect, involved in this operation enables engineers to\r\ndetermine the velocity at which the spacecraft is moving.)\r\n\r\n\r\n        _Table 1.

Such energy received at the\r\nantenna would measure about 0.00000000000000000002 watt (2 × 10⁻²⁰).\r\n\r\nThe amount of power received at the antenna during Mariner’s encounter\r\nwith Venus has been calculated at about 0.000000000000000001 of a watt\r\n(1 × 10⁻¹⁸). If a 100 percent efficient storage battery were charged\r\nwith this amount of energy for some 30 billion years, the battery would\r\nthen have stored enough energy to light an ordinary 1-watt flashlight\r\nbulb for about 1 second only.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, Goldstone engineers estimate that, if Mariner II had\r\ncontinued to function in all its systems and to point its directional\r\nantenna at the Earth, useful telemetry data could have been obtained by\r\nthe DSIF stations out to about 150 to 200 million miles, and tracking\r\ndata could have been secured from as far as 300 to 400 million miles.\r\n\r\nConstruction of the DSIF net was begun in 1958. The Goldstone station\r\nwas ready for the Pioneer III mission in December of that year. In\r\nMarch, 1959, Pioneer IV was successfully tracked beyond the Moon. Later\r\nin 1959, Pioneer V was tracked out to over 3 million miles.\r\n\r\nGoldstone participated in the 1960 Project Echo communication satellite\r\nexperiments and the entire net was used in the Ranger lunar missions of\r\n1961-1962. The Goldstone station performed Venus radar experiments in\r\n1961 and 1962 to determine the astronomical unit more precisely and to\r\nstudy the rotation rate and surface characteristics of the planet.\r\n\r\nFollowing the launch of Mariner II on August 27, 1962, the full DSIF net\r\nprovided 24-hour-per-day tracking coverage throughout the mission except\r\nfor a few days during the cruise phase. The net remained on the\r\nfull-coverage schedule through the period of Venus encounter on December\r\n14.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GOLDSTONE COMPLEX\r\n\r\nThe tracking antennas clustered in a 7-mile radius near Goldstone Dry\r\nLake, California, are the central complex of the DSIF net. Three\r\ntracking sites are included in the Goldstone Station: Pioneer Site (DSIF\r\n2), Echo Site (DSIF 3), and Venus Site. The Venus Site is used for\r\nadvanced radar astronomy, communication research experiments, and radio\r\ndevelopment; it took no direct part in the Mariner spacecraft tracking\r\noperations, but was used for the Venus radar experiments.\r\n\r\nPioneer Site has an 85-foot-diameter parabolic reflector antenna and the\r\nnecessary radio tracking, receiving, and data recording equipment. The\r\nantenna can be pointed to within better than 0.02 of a degree. The\r\nantenna has one (hour-angle) axis parallel to the polar axis of the\r\nEarth, and the other (declination) axis perpendicular to the polar axis\r\nand parallel to the equatorial plane of the Earth. This “polar-mount”\r\nfeature permits tracking on only one axis without moving the other.\r\n\r\nThe antenna weighs about 240 tons but can be rotated easily at a maximum\r\nrate of 1 degree per second. The minimum tracking rate or antenna swing\r\n(0.250686486 degree per minute) is equal to the rotation rate of the\r\nEarth. Two drive motors working simultaneously but at different speeds\r\nprovide an antibacklash safety factor. The antenna can operate safely in\r\nhigh winds.\r\n\r\nThe Pioneer antenna has a type of feed system (Cassegrain) that is\r\nessentially similar to that used in many large reflector telescopes. A\r\nconvex cone is mounted at the center of the main dish. A received signal\r\nis gathered by the main dish and the cone, reflected to a subreflector\r\non a quadripod, where the energy is concentrated in a narrow beam and\r\nreflected back to the feed collector point on the main dish. The\r\nCassegrain feed system lowers the noise picked up by the antenna by\r\nreducing interference from the back of the antenna, and permits more\r\nconvenient location of components.\r\n\r\nThe receiving system at Pioneer Site is also equipped with a low-noise,\r\nextremely sensitive installation combining a parametric amplifier and a\r\nmaser. The parametric amplifier is a device that is “pumped” or excited\r\nby microwave energy in such a way that, when an incoming signal is at\r\nits maximum, the effect is such that the “pumped-in” energy augments the\r\noriginal strength of the incoming signal. At the same time, the\r\nparametric amplifier reduces the receiving system’s own electronic noise\r\nto such a point that the spacecraft can be tracked twice as far as\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nThe maser uses a synthetic ruby mixed with chromium and is maintained at\r\nthe temperature of liquid helium—about 4.7 degrees K or -450 degrees F\r\n(just above absolute zero)—and when “pumped” with a microwave field, the\r\nmolecular energy levels of the maser material are redistributed so as to\r\nagain improve the signal amplification while lowering the system noise.\r\nThe maser doubles the tracking capability of the system with a\r\nparametric amplifier, and quadruples the capability of the receiver\r\nalone.\r\n\r\nThe antenna output at Pioneer is a wide-band telemetering channel. In\r\naddition, the antenna can be aimed automatically, using its own “error\r\nsignals.” At both the Pioneer and Echo sites at Goldstone, however, the\r\nantenna is pointed by a punched tape prepared by a special-purpose\r\ncomputer at JPL and transmitted to Goldstone by teletype.\r\n\r\nPioneer Site has a highly sensitive receiver designed to receive a\r\ncontinuous wave signal in a narrow frequency band in the 960-megacycle\r\nrange. The site has equipment for recording tracking data for use by\r\ncomputers in determining accurate spacecraft position and velocity.\r\n\r\nThe instrumentation equipment also includes electronic signal processing\r\ndevices, magnetic-tape recorders, oscillographs, and other supplementary\r\nreceiving equipment. The telemetered data can be decommutated (recovered\r\nfrom a signal shared by several measurements on a time basis), encoded,\r\nand transmitted by teletype in real time (as received from the\r\nspacecraft) to JPL.\r\n\r\nEcho Site is the primary installation in the Goldstone complex and has\r\nantenna and instrumentation facilities identical to those at Pioneer,\r\nexcept that there is no maser amplifier and a simpler feed system is\r\nused instead of the Cassegrain. However, Echo was used as a transmitting\r\nfacility and only as a stand-by receiving station during the Mariner\r\nmission.\r\n\r\nEcho has a 10-kilowatt, 890-megacycle transmitter which was utilized for\r\nsending commands to the Mariner spacecraft. In addition, the site has an\r\n“atomic clock” frequency standard, based on the atomic vibrations of\r\nrhubidium, which permits high-precision measurements of the radial\r\nvelocity of the spacecraft. A unit in the Echo system provides for\r\n“readback” and “confirmation” by the spacecraft of commands transmitted\r\nto it. In a sense, the spacecraft acknowledges receipt of the commands\r\nbefore executing them.\r\n\r\nWalter E. Larkin manages the Goldstone Station for JPL.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WOOMERA STATION\r\n\r\nThe Woomera, Australia, Station (DSIF 4), managed by William Mettyear\r\nfor the Australian Department of Supply, has essentially the same\r\nantenna and tracking capabilities as Goldstone Echo Site, but it has no\r\nprovisions for commanding the spacecraft. A small transmitter is used\r\nfor tracking purposes only. The station is staffed and operated by the\r\nAustralian Department of Supply.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _The Mobile Tracking Station (DSIF 1) follows the\r\n    fast-moving spacecraft during its first low-altitude pass over South\r\n    Africa._]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _Station 5 of the DSIF is located near Johannesburg\r\n    in South Africa._]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _DSIF 4, at Woomera, dominates the landscape in\r\n    Australia’s “outback.”_]\r\n\r\nWoomera, like Johannesburg, is capable of receiving tracking (position\r\nand velocity) data and telemetered information for real-time\r\ntransmission by radio teletype to JPL.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE JOHANNESBURG STATION\r\n\r\nDSIF 5 is located just outside Johannesburg in the Republic of South\r\nAfrica. This station is staffed by the National Institute of\r\nTelecommunications Research (NITR) of the South African Council for\r\nScientific and Industrial Research and managed by Douglas Hogg.\r\n\r\nThe antenna and receiving equipment are identical to the Goldstone Echo\r\nSite installation except for minor details. The station has both\r\ntransmitting and receiving capability and can send commands to the\r\nspacecraft. Recorded tracking and telemetered data are transmitted in\r\nreal time to JPL by radio teletype.\r\n\r\n\r\nMOBILE TRACKING STATION\r\n\r\nThe Mobile Tracking Station (DSIF 1) is a movable installation designed\r\nfor emplacement near the point of injection of a space probe to assist\r\nthe permanent stations in early acquisition of the spacecraft. This\r\nstation is necessary because at this point the spacecraft is relatively\r\nlow in altitude and consequently appears to move very fast across the\r\nsky. The Mobile Tracking Station has a fast-tracking antenna for use\r\nunder these conditions. DSIF 1 was located near the South African\r\nstation for Mariner II. It has a 10-foot parabolic antenna capable of\r\ntracking at a 10-degree-per-second rate. A 25-watt, 890-megacycle\r\ntransmitter is used for obtaining tracking information. A diplexer\r\npermits simultaneous transmission and reception on the same antenna\r\nwithout interference.\r\n\r\nThe equipment is installed in mobile vans so that the station can be\r\noperated in remote areas. The antenna is enclosed in a plastic dome and\r\nis mounted on a modified radar pedestal. The radome is inflatable with\r\nair and protects the antenna from wind and weather conditions.\r\n\r\nThese stations of the DSIF tracked Mariner II in flight and sent\r\ncommands to the spacecraft for the execution of maneuvers. The telemetry\r\ndata received from the spacecraft during the 129 days of its mission\r\nwere recorded and transmitted to JPL, where the information was\r\nprocessed and reduced by the computers of the space flight operations\r\ncomplex.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER 7\r\n                         THIRTEEN MILLION WORDS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe task of receiving, relaying, processing, and interpreting the data\r\ncoming in simultaneously on a twenty-four-hour basis for several months\r\nfrom the several scientific and many engineering sources of the Mariner\r\nspacecraft was of truly monumental proportions.\r\n\r\nThis activity involved five DSIF tracking stations scattered around the\r\nworld, a communication network, two computing stations and auxiliary\r\nfacilities, and some 400 personnel over a four-month period.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Mariner scientific information could be stored and\r\nsubsequently processed at a later (non-real) time, it was necessary to\r\nmake tracking and position data available almost as soon as it was\r\nreceived (in real time) so that the midcourse maneuver might be computed\r\nand transmitted to the spacecraft, and to further perfect the predicted\r\ntrajectory and arrival time at Venus.\r\n\r\nThe engineering performance of the many spacecraft subsystems was also\r\nof vital concern. Inaccurate operation in any of several areas could\r\nendanger the success of the entire mission. The performance of the\r\nattitude control system, the Earth and Sun sensors, the power system,\r\nand communications were all of critical importance. Corrective action\r\nwas possible in certain subsystems where trouble could be predicted from\r\nthe data or where limited breakdown had occurred.\r\n\r\nTo integrate all the varied activities necessary to accomplish the\r\nmission objectives, an organization was formed within JPL to coordinate\r\nthe DSIF, the communication network, the work of engineering and\r\nscientific advisory panels, and the computer facilities required to\r\nevaluate the data.\r\n\r\nThis organization was known as the Space Flight Operations Complex. For\r\noperational purposes only, it included the Space Flight Operations\r\nCenter, a Communication Center, and a Central Computing Facility (CCF).\r\nThe DSIF was responsive to the requirements of the organization, but was\r\nnot an integral part of it.\r\n\r\nA space flight operations director was responsible for integrating these\r\nmany functions into a world-wide Mariner space-flight organization. It\r\nwas an exhausting 109-day task, one that would severely tax all the\r\nresources of JPL in terms of know-how, qualified personnel, time, and\r\nequipment before Mariner completed its encounter with Venus.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMMUNICATION CONTROL\r\n\r\nThe Communication Center at JPL in Pasadena was one of the most active\r\nareas during the many days and nights of the Mariner II mission. All of\r\nthe teletype and radio lines from the Cape, South Africa, Australia, and\r\nGoldstone terminated in this Center. A high-speed data line bypassed the\r\nCommunication Center, linking Goldstone directly with the Central\r\nComputing Facility for quick, real-time computer processing of vital\r\nflight information.\r\n\r\nFrom the Communication Center, the teletype data and voice circuits were\r\nconnected to the several areas within JPL where the mission-control\r\nactivities were centered, and where the data output was being studied.\r\n\r\nThe Communication Center was equipped with teletype paper-page printers\r\nand paper-tape hole reperforators, which received and transmitted\r\ndata-word and number groups. The teletype lines terminating at the\r\nCenter included circuits from Goldstone, South Africa, Australia, and\r\nCape Canaveral.\r\n\r\nThere were three lines to Goldstone for full-time, one-way data\r\ntransmission. Duplex (simultaneous two-way) transmission was available\r\nto Woomera and South Africa on a full-time basis. In each case, a\r\nsecondary circuit was provided to the overseas sites for use during\r\ncritical periods and in case the primary radio-teletype circuits had\r\ntransmission difficulties. These secondary circuits used different radio\r\ntransmission paths in order to reduce the chance of complete loss of\r\ncontact for any extended period of time.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _Radio signals from Mariner are received on 85-ft.\r\n    antenna._]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _The highly sensitive receiver (shown under test) is\r\n    located in the control room of the station._]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _In Goldstone control room, DSIF personnel await\r\n    confirmation that spacecraft has begun to scan the planet Venus._]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _From DSIF stations, the data are teletyped in coded\r\n    format to Pasadena._]\r\n\r\nZ ZSQSGSGKGKXRGOQOS DNQ XZARZXAVAQQVA XXDRDZ\r\nQSGIGKGKXRGOQOX DXQ XZAIZXAVQQKDZ XXDRDDDRZ\r\nDXQ XZAIZAZVAQQZDZXXDLKKDRA Z DSQSGIGGGQXRDN\r\nG XXDRZSDRA Z DSQSGIGGGQXRGLZOX DXQ XZAIZAZV\r\nQSGIGGGQXRGLZOX DXQ XZAIZGAVAQQSXZXXDRDZDRA\r\nDXQ XQAIZGAVQQKVA XXDRDZDRANGDSSQSGIGGGQXRDI\r\nZ XXDRDDDRZLQ ZSQSGIGGGGXRGVZOA DNQ XZARZGAV\r\nQSGIGGGGXRGVQOA DNQ XZARZGAVQKZZAZXXDRZDDRA\r\nDNQ XZARZAZVAKDDGZXXDRDADIZLA DSQSGIGGGGXRGZ\r\nSZXXDRDDDRXOS DSQSQIGGGGXRDDZOA DNQ XZARZXAV\r\nQSGSGGGGXRDSQOG DXQ XZARZXAVAKDZDZXXDRDLDRA\r\nDXQ XZARZXAZZKZZDZXXDLKADRA Z DSQSGIGGGGXRGX\r\nGZXXDRZXDRZ Z DSQSAQGGGGXRDAZOG DXQ XZAIZAZV\r\nDRDXDRA Z DSQSGIGGGGXRDGSOG DXQ XZAIZAZVQKZS\r\nOGGGXRDGAOG DXQ XZAIZAZVQKZVA XXDRDZDRANGDSS\r\nXZAIZXAZZKZZD XXDRDLZDZHA DSQSGIGGGGXRDQAOQ\r\nDLKADRKHQ ZSQSGIGGGGXRDKZOQ DXQ XZAVZAAVQKZZ\r\nGGGGXRS ZOQ DXQ XZAIZAZVQKZDG XXDRDSDIZ A ZS\r\nXZAIZAZVQQKSX XXDRDDDRZNS ZSQSGIGGGGXRSOAOQ\r\nDRDZDRANGDSSQSAQGGGGXRSOAOK DNQ XZAVZAAVQQKZ\r\nGGGGXRSNZOK DNQ XZAIZAZZSQQZSZXXDLKADRA Z DS\r\nXZAIZGAVQQKZG XXDRZXDRZ Z DSQSAQGGGGXRSLAOK\r\nDRDSDRZ Z DSQSAQGGGGXRSLAOK DNQ XZAIZAZZZQKS\r\nGGGGXRSLAOK DNQ XZAIZAZZZQKVA XXDRDZDRANGDSS\r\nXRSIZHZ DXQ XZAIZAZZZQKQQZXXDRDNDRZNQ DSQSGS\r\nZXAZSQQZXZXXDLKQDRSQS ZSQSGIGGGQXRSVAHZ DXQ\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _Messages are received and routed at the JPL\r\n    Communications Center._]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _Data are routed to the digital computer at JPL._]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _Printout data are made available to experimenters._]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _Spacecraft status is posted in Operations Center._]\r\n\r\nThe Mobile Tracking Station in South Africa used the Johannesburg\r\ncommunication facilities.\r\n\r\nTwo one-way circuits for testing and control purposes were open to Cape\r\nCanaveral from a month before until after the spacecraft was launched.\r\nLines from the Communication Center to the Space Flight Operations\r\nCenter at JPL terminated in page printers and reperforators in several\r\nlocations.\r\n\r\nVoice circuits connected all of the stations with Operations Center\r\nthrough the Communication Center. Long-distance radio telephone calls\r\nwere placed to South Africa to establish contact before the launch\r\nsequence was started. Woomera used the Project Mercury voice circuits to\r\nthe United States during launch and for three days after.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE OPERATIONS CENTER\r\n\r\nThe actual nerve center of the Mariner operation was the Space Flight\r\nOperations Center (SFOC) at Pasadena. Here, technical and scientific\r\nadvisory panels reported to the Project Manager and the Mariner Test\r\nDirector on the performance of the spacecraft in flight, analyzed\r\ntrajectories, calculated the commands for the midcourse trajectory\r\ncorrection, and studied the scientific aspects of the mission.\r\n\r\nThese panels were a Spacecraft Data Analysis Team, a Scientific Data\r\nGroup, an Orbit Determination Group, a Tracking Data Analysis Group, and\r\na Midcourse Command Group.\r\n\r\nThe Spacecraft Data Analysis Team analyzed the engineering data\r\ntransmitted from the spacecraft to evaluate the performance of the\r\nsubsystems in flight. The Team was composed of one or more of the\r\nengineers responsible for each of the spacecraft subsystems, and a\r\nchairman.\r\n\r\nThe Science Data Group was composed of the project scientist and certain\r\nother scientists associated with the experiments on board the\r\nspacecraft. This Group evaluated the data from the scientific\r\nexperiments while Mariner was in flight and advised the Test Director on\r\nthe scientific status of the mission.\r\n\r\nThe Science Data Group was on continuous duty until 48 hours after\r\nlaunch, and at other times during the mission. During encounter with\r\nVenus, the Group was also in contact with the scientific experimenters\r\nfrom other participating organizations who were working with JPL.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _Closed circuit television monitors are used for\r\n    instant surveillance of the internal activities of the Operations\r\n    Center._]\r\n\r\nA Tracking Data Analysis Group analyzed the tracking data to be used in\r\norbit determination. They also assessed the performance of the DSIF\r\nfacilities and equipment used to obtain the data.\r\n\r\nThe Orbit Determination Group used the tracking data to produce\r\nestimates of the actual spacecraft trajectory, and to compute the\r\nspacecraft path with respect to the Earth, Venus, and the Sun. These\r\ncalculations were made once each day before the midcourse maneuver, once\r\na week during the cruise phase, and daily during and immediately after\r\nthe planet encounter.\r\n\r\nThe Operations Center was equipped with lighted boards on which the\r\nprogress of the mission was displayed. This information included\r\ntrajectory data, spacecraft performance, temperature and pressure\r\nreadings, and other data telemetered from the spacecraft subsystems.\r\n\r\nClosed-circuit television was used for coordinating the activities of\r\nthe SFOC. Operating personnel could use television monitors in four\r\nconsoles which were linked to six fixed cameras viewing teletype page\r\nprinters. The entire Operations Room could be kept under surveillance by\r\nthe Project Manager, the Test Director, or the DSIF Operations Manager,\r\nusing cameras controlled in “pan,” “tilt,” and “zoom.”\r\n\r\n\r\nCENTRAL COMPUTING FACILITY\r\n\r\nDuring the Mariner II mission, the JPL Central Computing Facility (CCF)\r\nprocessed approximately 13.1 million data words, or over 90 million\r\nbinary bits of computer data. (Binary bit = a discrete unit of\r\ninformation intelligible to a digital computer. One data word = 7 binary\r\nbits.)\r\n\r\nIn the four-month operation, about 100,000 tracking and telemetering\r\ndata cards were received and processed, yielding over 1.2 million\r\ncomputer pages of tabulated, processed, and analyzed data for evaluation\r\nby the engineers and scientists. Approximately 1,000 miles of magnetic\r\ntape were used in the 1,056 rolls recorded by the DSIF.\r\n\r\nThe Central Computing Facility processed and reduced tracking and\r\ntelemetry data from the spacecraft, as recorded and relayed by the\r\nstations of the DSIF. The tracking information was the basis for orbital\r\ncalculations and command decisions. After delivery of telemetry data on\r\nmagnetic tapes by the DSIF, the CCF stored the data for later reduction\r\nand analysis. Where telemetry data were being processed in real or\r\nnear-real time, certain critical engineering and scientific functions\r\nwere programmed to print-out an “alarm” reading when selected\r\nmeasurements in the data were outside specified limits.\r\n\r\nThe CCF consists of three stations at JPL: Station C, the primary\r\ncomputing facility; Station D, the secondary installation; and the\r\nTelemetry Processing Station (TPS).\r\n\r\nStation C was the principal installation for processing both tracking\r\nand telemetry data received from the DSIF tracking stations, both in\r\nreal and non-real time. The Station was equipped with a high-speed,\r\ngeneral-purpose digital computer with a 32,168-word memory and two\r\ninput-output channels, each able to handle 6 tape units. The associated\r\ncard-handling equipment was also available.\r\n\r\nTape translators or converters were provided for converting teletype\r\ndata and other digital information into magnetic tape format for\r\ncomputer input. The teletype-to-tape unit operated at a rate of 300\r\ncharacters per second.\r\n\r\nA smaller computer acted as a satellite of the larger unit, performing\r\nbookkeeping and such related functions as card punching, card reading,\r\nand listing.\r\n\r\nA high-speed unit microfilmed magnetic-tape printout was received from\r\nthe large computer. It provided “quick-look” copy within 30 minutes of\r\nprocessing the raw data. Various paper-tape-to-card and\r\ncard-to-paper-tape converters were used to eliminate human error in\r\nconverting teletype data tape to computer cards.\r\n\r\nStation C also utilized another computer as a real-time monitor and to\r\nprepare a magnetic tape file of all telemetered measurements for input\r\nto the large computer.\r\n\r\nStation D was the secondary or backup computational facility, primarily\r\nintended for use in case of equipment failure in Station C. During\r\ncertain critical phases of the Mariner mission—launch, orbit\r\ndetermination, midcourse maneuver—this facility paralleled the\r\noperations in Station C.\r\n\r\nStation D is equipped with three computers and various card-to-tape\r\nconverters and teletype equipment.\r\n\r\nThe Telemetry Processing Station received and processed all demodulated\r\ndata (that recovered from the radio carrier) on magnetic tapes recorded\r\nat the DSIF stations. The TPS output was digital magnetic tapes suitable\r\nfor computer entry.\r\n\r\nThe TPS equipment included FM discriminators, a code translator, a\r\ndevice for converting data from analog to digital form, and\r\nmagnetic-tape recorders. Basically, the equipment accepted the digital\r\noutputs from the tape units, the analog-to-digital converter, and the\r\ncode translator and put them in digital tape format for the computer\r\ninput.\r\n\r\nAs the launch operation started on August 27, the powered-flight portion\r\nof the space trajectories program was run at launch minus 5 minutes (L\r\nminus 5) and was repeated several times because of holds at AMR. The\r\norbit determination program was run at lift-off to calculate the first\r\norbit predictions used for aiding the DSIF in finding the spacecraft in\r\nflight.\r\n\r\nDuring the 12 hours following launch, both C and D Stations performed\r\nparallel computations on tracking data. Station D discontinued space\r\nflight operations at L plus 12 hours and resumed at the beginning of the\r\nmidcourse maneuver phase.\r\n\r\nTracking data processing and midcourse maneuver studies were conducted\r\ndaily until the midcourse maneuver was performed at L plus eight days.\r\nFor the following 97 days, tracking data were processed once each week\r\nfor orbit determination. Starting three days before the encounter,\r\ntracking data were processed daily until the beginning of the encounter\r\nphase.\r\n\r\nTracking data processing was conducted in near-real time throughout\r\nencounter day, and daily for two days thereafter. For these three days,\r\ntracking data were handled in Station D in order to permit exclusive use\r\nof Station C for telemetry data processing and analysis. After this\r\nthree-day period, including the encounter, Station C processed the\r\ntracking data every sixth day until the mission terminated on L plus 129\r\ndays.\r\n\r\nTelemetry data were processed in a different manner. Following the\r\nlaunch, DSIF Station 5 at South Africa received the telemetry signal\r\nfirst, demodulated it, and put it in the proper format for teletype\r\ntransmission to JPL. The other DSIF stations followed in sequence as the\r\nspacecraft was heard in other parts of the world. For two days after\r\nlaunch, the computers processed telemetry data as required by the\r\nSpacecraft Data Analysis Team.\r\n\r\nDuring those periods when the large computer was processing tracking\r\ndata, a secondary unit supplied quick-look data in near-real time. When\r\nGoldstone was listening to the spacecraft, quick-look data were\r\nprocessed in real time, using the high-speed data line direct to the\r\nCentral Computing Facility.\r\n\r\nFor the 106 days that Mariner was actually in Mode II (cruise), the\r\ntelemetry data were processed twenty-four hours a day, seven days a\r\nweek. Data were presented to the engineering and science analysis teams\r\nin quick-look format every three hours, except for short maintenance\r\ninterruptions, one computer failure, and a major modification requiring\r\nthree days, when a back-up data process mode of operation was used. The\r\nlarge computer performed full processing and analysis of engineering and\r\nscience data seven days a week from launch until the Venus encounter.\r\n\r\nOn encounter day, the secondary Station C computer processed telemetry\r\ndata from the high-speed Goldstone line. Data on magnetic tapes produced\r\nby the computer were processed and analyzed by the large unit in\r\nnear-real time every 30 minutes. The computer processing and delivery\r\ntime during this operation varied from 4½ to 7 minutes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER 8\r\n                       THE SCIENTIFIC EXPERIMENTS\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter a year of concentrated effort, in which the resources of NASA, the\r\nJet Propulsion Laboratory, and American science and industry had been\r\nmarshalled, Mariner II had probed secrets of the solar system some\r\nbillions of years old.\r\n\r\nScientists and engineers had studied the miles of data processed in\r\nCalifornia from the tapes recorded at the five DSIF tracking stations\r\naround the world. Two and a half months of careful analysis and\r\nevaluation yielded a revised estimate of Venus and of the phenomena of\r\nspace. As a result, the dynamics of the solar system were revealed in\r\nbetter perspective and the shrouded planet stood partially unmasked.\r\nWhen the Mariner data were correlated with the data gathered by JPL\r\nradar experiments at Goldstone in 1961 and 1962, the relationships\r\nbetween the Earth, Venus, and the Sun became far clearer than ever\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nTwo experiments were carried on the spacecraft for a close-up\r\ninvestigation of Venus’ atmosphere and temperature characteristics—a\r\nmicrowave radiometer and an infrared radiometer. They were designed to\r\noperate during the approximate 35-minute encounter period and at a\r\ndistance varying from about 10,200 miles to 49,200 miles from the center\r\nof the planet.[2]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _Cosmic dust detector._]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _Solar plasma spectrometer._]\r\n\r\n  COLLECTOR CUP\r\n  PROGRAMMER\r\n  ELECTROMETER\r\n  DEFLECTION PLATES\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _Magnetometer._]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _High-energy particle detector._]\r\n\r\n  COLLECTOR\r\n  SHIELD CAN\r\n  QUARTZ FIBER\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _Microwave and infrared radiometers._]\r\n\r\n  REFERENCE HORNS\r\n  MICROWAVE RADIOMETER\r\n  INFRARED RADIOMETER\r\n\r\n\r\n                     _Table 2.

Table 2 lists the experiments, the experimenters, and their\r\naffiliations.\r\n\r\nAt the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, the integration of the scientific\r\nexperiments and the generation of a number of them were carried out\r\nunder the direction of Dr. Manfred Eimer. R. C. Wyckoff was the project\r\nscientist and J. S. Martin was responsible for the engineering of the\r\nscientific experiments.\r\n\r\n\r\nDATA CONDITIONING SYSTEM\r\n\r\nMariner’s scientific experiments were controlled and their outputs\r\nprocessed by a data conditioning system which gathered the information\r\nfrom the instruments and prepared it for transmission to the Earth by\r\ntelemetry. In this function, the data system acted as a buffer between\r\nthe science systems and the spacecraft data encoder.\r\n\r\nThe pulse output of certain of the science instruments was counted and\r\nthe voltage amplitude representations of other instruments were\r\nconverted from analog form to a binary digital equivalent of the\r\ninformation signals. The data conditioning system also included circuits\r\nto permit time-sharing of the telemetry channels with the spacecraft\r\nengineering data, generation of periodic calibration signals for the\r\nradiometer and magnetometer, and control of the direction and speed of\r\nthe radiometer scanning cycle.\r\n\r\nDuring Mariner’s cruise mode, the data conditioning system was used for\r\nprocessing both engineering and science data. If the spacecraft lost\r\nlock on the Sun or the Earth during the cruise mode, no scientific data\r\nwould be telemetered during the reorientation period. Engineering data\r\nwere sampled and transmitted for about 17 seconds during every 37-second\r\ninterval. The planetary encounter mode involved only science and no\r\nengineering data transmission. In this mode, the science data were\r\nsampled during 20-second intervals.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOSMIC DUST DETECTOR\r\n\r\nThe cosmic dust detector on Mariner II was designed to measure the flux\r\ndensity, direction, and momentum of interplanetary dust particles\r\nbetween the Earth and Venus. These measurements were concerned with the\r\nparticles’ direction and distance from the Sun, the momentum with\r\nrespect to the spacecraft, the nature of any concentrations of the dust\r\nin streams, variations in cosmic dust flux with distance from the Earth\r\nand Venus, and the possible effects on manned flight.\r\n\r\nMariner’s cosmic dust instrument could detect a particle as small as\r\nsomething like a billionth of a gram, or about five-trillionths of a\r\npound. This type of sensor had been used on rockets even before Explorer\r\nI. It had yielded good results on Pioneer I in the region between the\r\nEarth and the Moon. The instrument was a 55-square-inch acoustical\r\ndetector plate, or sounding board, made of magnesium. A crystal\r\nmicrophone was attached to the center of the plate. The instrument could\r\ndetect both low- and high-momentum particles and also provide a rough\r\nidea of their direction of travel.\r\n\r\nThe dust particle counters were read once each 37 seconds during the\r\ncruise mode. This rate was increased to once each 20 seconds during the\r\nencounter with Venus.\r\n\r\nThe instrument was attached to the top of the basic hexagonal structure;\r\nit weighed 1.85 pounds, and consumed only 0.8 watt of power.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLAR PLASMA EXPERIMENT\r\n\r\nIn order to investigate the phenomena associated with the movement of\r\nplasma (charged particles of low energy and density streaming out from\r\nthe Sun to form the so-called “solar wind”) in interplanetary space,\r\nMariner carried a solar plasma spectrometer that measured the flux and\r\nenergy spectrum of positively charged plasma components with energies in\r\nthe range 240 to 8400 volts. The extremely sensitive plasma detector\r\nunit was open to space, consumed 1 watt of power, and consisted of four\r\nbasic elements: curved electrostatic deflection plates and collector\r\ncup, electrometer, a sweep amplifier, and a programmer.\r\n\r\nThe curved deflector plates formed a tunnel that projected from the\r\nchassis on the spacecraft hexagon in which the instrument was housed.\r\nPointed toward the Sun, the gold-plated magnesium deflector plates\r\ngathered particles from space. Since the walls of the tunnel each\r\ncarried different electrical charges, only particles with just the\r\ncorrect energy and speed could pass through and be detected by the\r\ncollector cup without striking the charged walls. A sensitive\r\nelectrometer circuit then measured the current generated by the flow of\r\nthe charged particles reaching the cup.\r\n\r\nThe deflection plates were supplied by amplifier-generated voltages\r\nwhich were varied in 10 steps, each lasting about 18 seconds, allowing\r\nthe instrument to measure protons with energies in the 240 to 8,400\r\nelectron volt range. The programmer switched in the proper voltage and\r\nresistances.\r\n\r\n\r\nHIGH-ENERGY RADIATION EXPERIMENT\r\n\r\nMariner carried an experiment to measure high-energy radiation in space\r\nand near Venus. The charged particles measured by Mariner were primarily\r\ncosmic rays (protons or the nuclei of hydrogen atoms), alpha particles\r\n(nuclei of helium atoms), the nuclei of other heavier atoms, and\r\nelectrons. The study of these particles in space and those which might\r\nbe trapped near Venus was undertaken in the hope of a better\r\nunderstanding of the dynamics of the solar system and the potential\r\nhazards to manned flight.\r\n\r\nThe high-energy radiation experiment consisted of an ionization chamber\r\nand detectors measuring particle flux (velocity times density), all\r\nmounted in a box measuring 6 × 6 × 2 inches and weighing just under 3\r\npounds. The box was attached halfway up the spacecraft superstructure in\r\norder to isolate the instruments as much as possible from secondary\r\nemission particles produced when the spacecraft was struck by cosmic\r\nrays, and to prevent the spacecraft from blocking high-energy radiation\r\nfrom space.\r\n\r\nThe ionization chamber had a stainless steel shell 5 inches in diameter,\r\nwith walls only 1/100-inch thick. The chamber was filled with argon gas\r\ninto which was projected a quartz fibre next to a quartz rod.\r\n\r\nA charged particle entering the chamber would leave a wake of ions in\r\nthe argon gas. Negative ions accumulated on the rod, reducing the\r\npotential between the rod and the spherical shell, eventually causing\r\nthe quartz fibre to touch the rod. This action discharged the rod,\r\nproducing an electrical pulse which was amplified and transmitted to the\r\nEarth. The rod was then recharged and the fibre returned to its original\r\nposition.\r\n\r\nIn order to penetrate the walls of the chamber, protons required an\r\nenergy of 10 million electron volts (Mev), electrons needed 0.5 Mev, and\r\nalpha particles 40 Mev.\r\n\r\nThe particle flux detector incorporated three Geiger-Mueller tubes, two\r\nof which formed a companion experiment to the ionization chamber; each\r\ngenerated a current pulse whenever a charged particle was detected. One\r\ntube was shielded by an 8/1,000-inch-thick stainless steel sleeve, the\r\nother by a 24/1,000-inch-thick electron-stopping beryllium shield. Thus,\r\nthe proportion of particles could be determined.\r\n\r\nThe third Geiger-Mueller tube was an end-window Anton-type sensor with a\r\nmica window that admitted protons with energies greater than 0.5 Mev and\r\nelectrons, 40,000 electron volts. A magnesium shield around the rest of\r\nthe tube enabled the instrument to determine the direction of particles\r\npenetrating only the window.\r\n\r\nThe three Geiger-Mueller tubes protruded from the box on the\r\nsuperstructure of the spacecraft. The end-window tube was inclined 20\r\ndegrees from the others and 70 degrees from the spacecraft-Sun line\r\nsince it had to be shielded from direct solar exposure.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MAGNETOMETER\r\n\r\nMariner carried a magnetometer to measure the magnetic field in\r\ninterplanetary space and in the vicinity of Venus. Lower sensitivity\r\nlimit of the instrument was about 5 gamma. A gamma is a unit of magnetic\r\nmeasurement and is equal to 10⁻⁵ or 1/100,000 oersted, or 1/30,000 of\r\nthe Earth’s magnetic field at the equator. The nails in one of your\r\nshoes would probably produce a field of about 1 gamma at a distance of\r\napproximately 4 feet.\r\n\r\nHoused in a 6- × 3-inch metal cylinder, the instrument consisted of\r\nthree magnetic core sensors, each aligned on a different axis to read\r\nthe three magnetic field components and having primary and secondary\r\nwindings. The presence of a magnetic field altered the current in the\r\nsecondary winding in proportion to the strength of the field\r\nencountered.\r\n\r\nThe magnetometer was attached near the top of the superstructure, just\r\nbelow the omni-antenna, in order to remove it as far as possible from\r\nany spacecraft components having magnetic fields of their own.\r\n\r\nAn auxiliary coil was wound around each of the instrument’s magnetic\r\nsensor cores to compensate for permanent magnetic fields existing in the\r\nspacecraft itself. These spacecraft fields were measured at the\r\nmagnetometer before launch and, in flight, the auxiliary coils carried\r\ncurrents of sufficient strength to cancel out the spacecraft’s magnetic\r\nfields.\r\n\r\nThe magnetometer reported almost continuously on its journey and for 20\r\ndays after encounter. During the encounter, observations were made each\r\n20 seconds on each of the three components of the magnetic field.\r\n\r\n\r\nMICROWAVE RADIOMETER\r\n\r\nA microwave radiometer on board Mariner II was designed to scan Venus\r\nduring encounter at two wavelengths: 13.5 and 19 millimeters. The\r\nradiometer was intended to help settle some of the controversies about\r\nthe origin of the apparently high surface temperature emanating from\r\nVenus, and the value of the surface temperature.\r\n\r\nThe equipment included a 19-inch-diameter parabolic antenna mounted\r\nabove the basic hexagonal structure on a swivel driven in a 120-degree\r\nscanning motion by a motor. The radiometer electronics circuits were\r\nhoused behind the antenna dish. The antenna was equipped with a\r\ndiplexer, which allowed it to receive both wavelengths at once without\r\ninterference, and to compare the signals emanating from the two\r\nreference horns with those from the planet. The reference horns were\r\npointed away from the main antenna beam so they would look into deep\r\nspace as Mariner passed Venus. This feature allowed the antenna to\r\n“bring in” a reference temperature of approximately absolute zero during\r\nencounter.\r\n\r\nThe microwave radiometer was to be turned on 10 hours before the\r\nencounter began. An electric motor was then to start a scanning or\r\n“nodding” motion of 120 degrees at the rate of 1 degree per second. Upon\r\nradiometer contact with the planet, this scanning rate would be reduced\r\nto 1/10 degree per second as long as the planetary disk was scanned. A\r\nspecial command system in the data conditioning system would reverse or\r\nnormalize the direction of scan as the radiometer reached the edge or\r\nlimb of the planet.\r\n\r\nThe signals from the antenna and the reference horns were to be\r\nprocessed and the data handled in a receiver, located behind the\r\nantenna, which measured the difference between the signals from Venus\r\nand the reference signals from space. The information was then to be\r\ntelemetered to the Earth.\r\n\r\nThe microwave radiometer was automatically calibrated twenty-three times\r\nduring the mission by a sequence originating in the data conditioning\r\nsystem, so that the correct functioning of the instrument could be\r\ndetermined before the encounter with Venus.\r\n\r\n\r\nINFRARED RADIOMETER\r\n\r\nThe infrared radiometer was a companion experiment to the microwave\r\ninstrument and was rigidly mounted to the microwave antenna so that both\r\nradiometers would look at the same area of Venus with the same scanning\r\nrate. The instrument detected radiation in the 8 to 9 and 10 to 10.8\r\nmicron regions of the infrared spectrum.\r\n\r\nThe infrared radiometer had two optical sensors. As the energy entered\r\nthe system, it was “chopped” by a rotating disk, alternately passing or\r\ncomparing emissions from Venus and from empty space. The beam was then\r\nsplit by a filter into the two wavelength regions. The output was then\r\ndetected, processed, and transmitted to the Earth.\r\n\r\nThe infrared radiometer measured 6 inches by 2 inches, weighed 2.7\r\npounds, and consumed 2 watts of power. The instrument was equipped with\r\na calibration plate which was mounted on a superstructure truss adjacent\r\nto the radiometer.\r\n\r\n\r\nMARINER’S SCIENTIFIC OBJECTIVES\r\n\r\nEquipped with these instruments and with the mechanism for getting the\r\nmeasurements back to Earth, Mariner II was prepared to look for the\r\nanswers to some of the questions inherent in its over-all mission\r\nobjectives:\r\n\r\n  1. The investigation of interplanetary space between the Earth and\r\n          Venus, measuring such phenomena as the cosmic dust, the\r\n          mysterious plasma or solar winds, high-energy cosmic rays from\r\n          space outside our solar system, charged particles from the\r\n          Sun, and the magnetic fields of space.\r\n  2. The experiments to be performed near Venus (at about 21,150 miles\r\n          out from the surface) in an effort to understand its magnetic\r\n          fields, radiation belts, the temperature and composition of\r\n          its clouds, and the temperature and conditions on the surface\r\n          of the planet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER 9\r\n                         THE LEGACY OF MARINER\r\n\r\n\r\nIf intelligent life had existed on Venus on the afternoon of the Earth’s\r\nDecember 14, 1962, and if it could have seen through the clouds, it\r\nmight have observed Mariner II approach from the night side, drift down\r\ncloser, cross over to the daylight face, and move away toward the Sun to\r\nthe right. The time was the equivalent of 12:34 p.m. along the Pacific\r\nCoast of the United States, where the spacecraft was being tracked.\r\n\r\nMariner II had reached the climax of its 180-million-mile, 109-day trip\r\nthrough space. The 35-minute encounter with Venus would tell Earth\r\nscientists more about our sister planet than they had been able to learn\r\nduring all the preceding centuries.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPACE WITHOUT DUST?\r\n\r\nBefore Mariner, scientists theorized about the existence of clouds of\r\ncosmic dust around the Sun. A knowledge of the composition, origin, and\r\nthe dynamics of these minute particles is necessary for study of the\r\norigins and evolution of the solar system.\r\n\r\nTiny particles of cosmic dust (some with masses as low as 1.3 × 10⁻¹⁰\r\ngram or about one-trillionth of a pound) were thought to be present in\r\nthe solar system and have been recorded by satellites in the near-Earth\r\nregions.\r\n\r\nThese microcosmic particles could be either the residue left over after\r\nour solar system was formed some 5 billion years ago, possibly by\r\ncondensation of huge masses of gas and dust clouds; or, the debris\r\ndeposited within our system by the far-flung and decaying tails of\r\npassing comets; or, the dust trapped from galactic space by the magnetic\r\nfields of the Sun and the planets.\r\n\r\nAnalysis of the more than 1,700 hours of cosmic dust detector data\r\nrecovered from the flight of Mariner II seems to indicate that in the\r\nregion between the Earth and Venus the concentration of tiny cosmic dust\r\nparticles is some ten-thousand times less than that observed near the\r\nEarth.\r\n\r\nDuring the 129 days (including the post-encounter period) of Mariner’s\r\nmission, the data showed only one dust particle impact which occurred in\r\ndeep space and not near Venus. Equivalent experiments near Earth (on\r\nboard Earth satellites) have yielded over 3,700 such impacts within\r\nperiods of approximately 500 hours. The cause of this heavy near-Earth\r\nconcentration, the exact types of particles, and their source are still\r\nunknown.\r\n\r\nThe cosmic dust experiment performed well during the Mariner mission.\r\nAlthough some calibration difficulty was observed about two weeks before\r\nthe Venus encounter, possibly caused by overheating of the sensor\r\ncrystal, there was no apparent effect in the electronic circuits.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE UBIQUITOUS SOLAR WIND\r\n\r\nFor some time prior to Mariner, scientists postulated the existence of a\r\nso-called plasma flow or “solar wind” streaming out from the Sun, to\r\nexplain the motion of comet tails (which always point away from the Sun,\r\nperhaps repelled by the plasma), geomagnetic storms, aurorae, and other\r\nsuch disturbances. (Plasma is defined as a gas in which the atoms are\r\ndissociated into atomic nuclei and electrons, but which, as a whole, is\r\nelectrically neutral.)\r\n\r\nThe solar wind was thought to drastically alter the configuration of the\r\nSun’s external magnetic field. Plasma moving at extreme velocities is\r\nable to carry with it the lines of magnetic force originating in the\r\nSun’s corona and to distort any fields it encounters as it moves out\r\nfrom the Sun.\r\n\r\nIt was believed that these moving plasma currents are also capable of\r\naltering the size of a planet’s field of magnetic flux. When this\r\nhappens, the field on the sunlit face of the planet is compressed and\r\nthe dark side has an elongated expansion of the field. For example, the\r\nouter boundary of the Earth’s magnetic field is pushed in by the solar\r\nwind to about 40,000 miles from the Earth on the sunward side. On the\r\ndark side, the field extends out much farther.\r\n\r\nThe solar wind was also known to have an apparent effect on the movement\r\nof cosmic rays. As the Sun spots increase in the regular 11-year cycle,\r\nthe number of cosmic rays reaching the Earth from outside our solar\r\nsystem will decrease.\r\n\r\nMariner II found that streams of plasma are constantly flowing out from\r\nthe Sun. This fluctuating, extremely tenuous solar wind seems to\r\ndominate interplanetary space in our region of the solar system. The\r\nwind moves at velocities varying from about 200 to 500 miles per second\r\n(about 720,000 to 1,800,000 miles per hour), and measures up to perhaps\r\na million degrees Fahrenheit (within the subatomic structure).\r\n\r\nWith the solar plasma spectrometer working at ten different energy\r\nlevels, Mariner required 3.7 minutes to run through a complete energy\r\nspectrum. During the 123 days, when readings were made, a total of\r\n40,000 such spectra were recorded. Plasma was monitored on 104 of those\r\n123 days, and on every one of the spectra, the plasma was always\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nMariner showed that the energies of the particles in the solar winds are\r\nvery low, on the order of a few hundred or few thousand electron volts,\r\nas compared with the billions and trillions of electron volts measured\r\nin cosmic radiation.\r\n\r\nThe extreme tenuousity or low density of the solar wind is difficult to\r\ncomprehend: about 10 to 20 protons (hydrogen nuclei) and electrons per\r\ncubic inch. But despite the low energy and density, solar wind particles\r\nin our region of the solar system are billions of times more numerous\r\nthan cosmic rays and, therefore, the total energy content of the winds\r\nis much greater than that of the cosmic rays.\r\n\r\nMariner found that when the surface of the Sun was relatively inactive,\r\nthe velocity of the wind was a little less than 250 miles per second and\r\nthe temperature a few hundred thousand degrees. The plasma was always\r\npresent, but the density and the velocity varied. Flare activity on the\r\nSun seemed to eject clouds of plasma, greatly increasing the velocity\r\nand density of the winds. Where the particles were protons, their\r\nenergies ranged from 750 to 2,500 electron volts.\r\n\r\nThe experiment also showed that the velocity of the plasma apparently\r\nundergoes frequent fluctuations of this type. On approximately twenty\r\noccasions, the velocity increased within a day or two by 20 to 100%.\r\nThese disturbances seemed to correlate well with magnetic storms\r\nobserved on the Earth. In several cases, the sudden increase in the\r\nsolar plasma flux preceded various geomagnetic effects observed on the\r\nEarth by only a short time.\r\n\r\nThe Mariner solar plasma experiment was the first extensive measurement\r\nof the intensity and velocity spectrum of solar plasma taken far enough\r\nfrom the Earth’s field so that the Earth would have no effect on the\r\nresults.\r\n\r\n\r\nHIGH-ENERGY PARTICLES: FATAL DOSAGE?\r\n\r\nSpeculation has long existed as to the amount of high-energy radiation\r\n(from cosmic rays and particles from the Sun with energies in the\r\nmillions of electron volts) present within our solar system and as to\r\nwhether exposure would be fatal to a human space traveler.\r\n\r\nThis high-energy type of ionizing radiation is thought to consist of the\r\nnuclei of such atoms as hydrogen and helium, and of electrons, all\r\nmoving very rapidly. The individual particles are energetic enough to\r\npenetrate considerable amounts of matter. The concentration of these\r\nparticles is apparently much lower than that of low-energy plasma.\r\n\r\nThe experiments were designed to detect three types of high-energy\r\nradiation particles: the cosmic rays coming from outside the solar\r\nsystem, solar flare particles, and radiation trapped around Venus (as\r\nthat which is found in the Earth’s Van Allen Belt).\r\n\r\nThese high-energy radiation particles (also thought to affect aurorae\r\nand radio blackouts on the Earth) measure from about one hundred\r\nthousand electron volts up to billions of volts. The distribution of\r\nthis energy is thought to be uniform outside the solar system and is\r\nassumed to move in all directions in a pattern remaining essentially\r\nconstant over thousands of years.\r\n\r\nInside the solar system, the amount of such radiation reaching the Earth\r\nis apparently controlled by the magnetic fields found in interplanetary\r\nspace and near the Earth.\r\n\r\nThe number of cosmic rays changes by a large amount over the course of\r\nan 11-year Sun-spot cycle, and below a certain energy level (5,000 Mev)\r\nfew cosmic rays are present in the solar system. They are probably\r\ndeflected by plasma currents or magnetic fields.\r\n\r\nMariner’s charged particles experiment indicated that cosmic radiation\r\n(bombardment by cosmic rays), both from galactic space and those\r\nparticles originating in the Sun, would not have been fatal to an\r\nastronaut, at least during the four-month period of Mariner’s mission.\r\n\r\nThe accumulated radiation inside the counters was only 3 roentgens, and\r\nduring the one solar storm recorded on October 23 and 24, the dosage\r\nmeasured only about ¼ roentgen. In other words, the dosage amounts to\r\nabout one-thousandth of the usually accepted “half-lethal” dosage, or\r\nthat level at which half of the persons exposed would die. An astronaut\r\nmight accept many times the dosage detected by Mariner II without\r\nserious effects.\r\n\r\nThe experiment also showed little variation in density of charged\r\nparticles during the trip, even with a 30% decrease in distance from the\r\nSun, and no apparent increase due to magnetically trapped particles or\r\nradiation belts near Venus as compared with interplanetary space.\r\nHowever, these measurements were made during a period when the Sun was\r\nslowly decreasing in activity at the end of an 11-year cycle. The Sun\r\nspots will be at a minimum in 1964-1965, when galactic cosmic rays will\r\nsharply increase. Further experiments are needed to sample the charged\r\nparticles in space under all conditions.\r\n\r\nThe lack of change measured by the ionization chamber during the mission\r\nwas significant; the cosmic-ray flux of approximately 3 particles per\r\nsquare centimeter per second throughout the flight was an unusually\r\nconstant value. A clear increase in high-energy particles (10 Mev to\r\nabout 800 Mev) emitted by the Sun was noted only once: a flare-up\r\nbetween 7:42 and 8:45 a.m., PST, October 23. The ionization chamber\r\nreading began to increase before the flare disappeared. From a\r\nbackground reading of 670 ion pairs per cubic centimeter per second per\r\nstandard atmosphere, it went to a peak value of 18,000, varied a bit,\r\nand remained above 10,000 for 6 hours before gradually decreasing over a\r\nperiod of several days. Meanwhile, the flux of the particles detected by\r\nthe Geiger counter rose from the background count of 3 to a peak of 16\r\nper square centimeter per second. Ionization thus increased much more\r\nthan the number of particles, indicating to the scientists that the\r\nhigh-energy particles coming from the Sun might have had much lower\r\naverage energies than the galactic cosmic rays.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _Data obtained by microwave radiometer are\r\n    illustrated at left; results of infrared radiometer experiment are\r\n    shown at right. Note how moving spacecraft sees more of atmosphere\r\n    along limb or edge of planet, less in center._]\r\n\r\nIn contrast, the low-energy experiment detected the October 23 event,\r\nand eight or ten others not seen by the high-energy detectors. These\r\nmust have been low-penetrating particles excluded by the thicker walls\r\nof the high-energy instrument. These particles were perhaps protons\r\nbetween 0.5 and 10 Mev or electrons between 0.04 and 0.5 Mev.\r\n\r\nAt 20,000 miles from the Earth, the rate at which high-energy particles\r\nhave been observed has been recorded at several thousand per second.\r\nWith Mariner at approximately the same distance from Venus, the average\r\nwas only one particle per second, as it had been during most of the\r\nmonth of November in space. Such a rate would indicate a low planetary\r\nmagnetic field, or one that did not extend out as far as Mariner’s\r\n21,598-mile closest approach to the surface.\r\n\r\nMariner II measured and transmitted data in unprecedented quantity and\r\nquality during the long trip. In summary, Mariner showed that, during\r\nthe measuring period, particles were numerous in the energy ranges from\r\na few hundred to 1,000 electron volts. Protons in the range 0.5 to 10\r\nMev were not numerous, but at times the flux (density) was several times\r\nthat of cosmic rays.\r\n\r\nAlmost no protons were shown in the 10 to 800 Mev range, except during\r\nsolar flares when the particles in this range were numerous. Above 800\r\nMev (primarily those cosmic rays entering interplanetary space from\r\noutside the solar system) the number decreased rapidly as the energy\r\nincreased, the average total being about 3 per centimeter per second.\r\n\r\nDuring one 30-day period in November and December, the low-energy\r\ncounter saw only two small increases in radiation intensity. At this\r\ntime, the mean velocity of the solar wind was considerably lower than\r\nduring September and October. This might suggest that high-velocity\r\nplasma and low-energy cosmic rays might both originate from the same\r\nsolar source.\r\n\r\n\r\nA MAGNETIC FIELD?\r\n\r\nPrior to the Mariner II mission, no conclusive evidence had ever been\r\npresented concerning a Venusian magnetic field and nothing was known\r\nabout possible fluid motions in a molten core or other hypotheses\r\nconcerning the interior of the planet.\r\n\r\nScientists assumed that Venus had a field somewhat similar to the\r\nEarth’s, although possibly reduced in magnitude because of the\r\napparently slow rate of rotation and the pressure of solar plasma. Many\r\nquestions had also been raised concerning the nature of the atmosphere,\r\ncharged particles in the vicinity of the planet, magnetic storms, and\r\naurorae. Good magnetometer data from Mariner II would help solve some of\r\nthese problems.\r\n\r\nMariner’s magnetometer experiment also sought verification of the\r\nexistence and nature of a steady magnetic field in interplanetary space.\r\nThis would be important in understanding the charged particle balance of\r\nthe inner solar system. Other objectives of the experiment were to\r\nestablish both the direction and the magnitude of long-period\r\nfluctuations in the interplanetary magnetic field and to study solar\r\ndisturbances and such problems in magnetohydrodynamics (the study of the\r\nmotion of charged particles and their surrounding magnetic fields) as\r\nthe existence and effect of magnetized and charged plasmas in space.\r\n\r\nThe strength of a planet’s field is thought to be closely related to its\r\nrate of rotation—the slower the rotation, the weaker the field. As a\r\nconsequence, if Venus’ field is simple in structure like the Earth’s,\r\nthe surface field should be 5 to 10% that of the Earth. If the structure\r\nof the field is complex, the surface field in places might exceed the\r\nEarth’s without increasing the field along Mariner’s trajectory to\r\nobservable values.\r\n\r\nMost of the phenomena associated with the Earth’s magnetic field are\r\nlikely to be significantly modified or completely absent in and around\r\nVenus. Auroral displays and the trapping of charged particles in\r\nradiation belts such as our Van Allen would be missing. The field of the\r\nEarth keeps low- and moderate-energy cosmic rays away from the top of\r\nthe atmosphere, except in the polar regions. The cosmic ray flux at the\r\ntop of Venus’ atmosphere is likely to correspond everywhere to the high\r\nlevel found at the Earth’s poles.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _As it encountered Venus, Mariner II made three scans\r\n    of the planet._]\r\n\r\n  SUN\r\n  DIRECTION OF SCAN\r\n  DATA READINGS (18 TOTAL)\r\n\r\nIn contrast to Venus, Jupiter, which is ten times larger in mass and\r\nvolume and rotates twice as fast as the Earth, has a field considerably\r\nstronger than the Earth’s. The Moon has a field on the sunlit side\r\n(according to Russian measurements) which, because of the Moon’s slow\r\nrotation rate, is less than ⅓ of 1% of the Earth’s at the Equator. Thus,\r\na planet’s rotation, if at a less rapid rate than the Earth’s, seems to\r\nproduce smaller magnetic fields. This theory is consistent with the idea\r\nof a planetary magnetic field resulting from the dynamo action inside\r\nthe molten core of a rotating planet.\r\n\r\nThe Sun, on the whole, has a fairly regular dipole field. Superimposed\r\non this are some very large fields associated with disturbed regions\r\nsuch as spots or flares, which produce fields of very great intensities.\r\n\r\nThese solar fields are drawn out into space by plasma flow. Although\r\nrelatively small in magnitude, these fields are an important influence\r\non the propagation of particles. And the areas in question are very\r\nlarge—something on the order of an astronomical unit.\r\n\r\nMariner II seemed to show that, in space, a generally quiet\r\nmagnetic-field condition was found to exist, measuring something less\r\nthan 10 gamma and fluctuating over periods of 1 second to 1 minute.\r\n\r\nAs Mariner made its closest approach to Venus, the magnetometer saw no\r\nsignificant change, a condition also noted by the radiation and solar\r\nplasma detectors. The magnetic field data looked essentially as they had\r\nin interplanetary space, without either fluctuations or smooth changes.\r\n\r\nThe encounter produced no slow changes, nor was there a continuous\r\nfluctuation as in the interplanetary regions. There was no indication of\r\ntrapped particles or near-Venus modification in the flow of solar\r\nplasma.\r\n\r\nOn the Earth’s sunny side, a definite magnetic field exists out to\r\n40,000 miles, and on the side away from the Sun considerably farther. If\r\nVenus’ field had been similar to the Earth’s, a reading of 100 to 200\r\ngamma, a large cosmic-ray count, and an absence of solar plasma should\r\nhave been shown, but none of these phenomena were noted by Mariner.\r\n\r\nThese results do not prove that Venus definitely has no magnetic field,\r\nbut only that it was not measurable at Mariner’s 21,598-mile point of\r\nclosest approach. The slow rotation rate and the pressure of the solar\r\nwinds probably combine to limit the field to a value one tenth of the\r\nEarth’s. Since Mariner passed Venus on the sunlit side, readings are\r\nrequired on the dark side in order to confirm the condition of the\r\nmagnetic field on that side of the planet, which normally should be\r\nconsiderably extended.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SURFACE: HOW HOT?\r\n\r\nBefore Mariner, scientists had offered two main theories about the\r\nsurface of Venus: It had either an electrically charged ionosphere\r\ncausing false high-temperature readings on Earth instruments despite a\r\ncool surface, or a hot surface with clouds becoming increasingly colder\r\nwith altitude.\r\n\r\nThe cool-surface theory supposed an ionosphere with a layer of electrons\r\nhaving a density thousands of times that of the Earth’s upper\r\natmosphere. Microwave radiations from this electrical layer would cause\r\nmisleading readings on Earth instruments. As a space probe scanned\r\nacross such an atmosphere, it would see the least amount of charged\r\nionosphere when looking straight down, and the most concentrated amount\r\nwhile scanning the limb or edge. In the latter case, it would be at an\r\nangle and would show essentially a thickening effect of the atmosphere\r\nbecause of the curvature of the planet.\r\n\r\nAs the probe approached the edge, the phenomenon known as “limb\r\nbrightening” would occur, since the instruments would see more of the\r\nelectron-charged ionosphere and little if any of the cooler surface. The\r\ntemperature readings would, therefore, be correspondingly higher at the\r\nlimbs.\r\n\r\nThe other theory, held by most scientists, visualized a hot surface on\r\nVenus, with no heavy concentration of electrons in the atmosphere, but\r\nwith cooler clouds at higher altitudes. Thus, the spacecraft would look\r\nat a very hot planet from space, covered by colder, thick clouds.\r\nStraight down, the microwave radiometer would see the hot surface\r\nthrough the clouds. When approaching the limb, the radiations would\r\nencounter a thicker concentration of atmosphere and might not see any of\r\nthe hot surface. This condition, “limb darkening,” would be\r\ncharacterized by temperatures decreasing as the edges of the planet were\r\napproached.\r\n\r\nAn instrument capability or resolution much higher than that available\r\nfrom the Earth was required to resolve the limb-brightening or\r\nlimb-darkening controversy. Mariner’s radiometer would be able to\r\nprovide something like one hundred times better resolution than the\r\nEarth-based measurements.\r\n\r\nAt 11:59 a.m., PST, on December 14, 1962, Mariner’s radiometers began to\r\nscan the planet Venus in a nodding motion at a rate of 0.1 degree per\r\nsecond and reaching an angular sweep of nominally 120 degrees. The\r\nradiometers had been switched on 6½ hours before the encounter with\r\nVenus and they continued to operate for another hour afterward.\r\n\r\nThe microwave radiometer looked at Venus at a wavelength of 13.5\r\nmillimeters and 19 millimeters. The 13.5-millimeter region was the\r\nlocation of a microwave water absorption band within the electromagnetic\r\nspectrum, but it was not anticipated that it would detect any water\r\nvapor on Venus. These measurements would allow determination of\r\natmospheric radiation, averaging the hot temperatures near the surface,\r\nthe warmer clouds at lower levels, and the lower temperatures found in\r\nthe high atmosphere. If the atmosphere were a strong absorber of\r\nmicrowave energy at 13.5 millimeters, only the temperature of the upper\r\nlayers would be reported.\r\n\r\nUnaffected by water vapor, 19-millimeter radiations could be detected\r\nfrom deeper down into the cloud cover, perhaps from near or at the\r\nplanet’s surface. Large temperature differences between the 19- and 13.5\r\nmillimeter readings would indicate the relative amount of water vapor\r\npresent in the atmosphere. The 19-millimeter radiations would also test\r\nthe limb-brightening theory.\r\n\r\nDuring its scanning operation, Mariner telemetered back to Earth about\r\n18 digital data points, represented as voltage fluctuations in relation\r\nto time. The first scan was on the dark side, going up on the planet:\r\nthe distance from the surface was 16,479 miles at midscan, and the\r\nbrightness temperature was 369 degrees F. The second scan nearly\r\nparalleled the terminator (junction of light and dark sides) but crossed\r\nit going down; it was made from 14,957 miles at midscan and showed a\r\ntemperature of 566 degrees F. The final scan, 13,776 miles at midpoint,\r\nshowed 261 degrees F as it swept across the sunlit side of Venus in an\r\nupward direction.\r\n\r\nThe brightness temperature recorded by Mariner’s radiometer is not the\r\ntrue temperature of the surface. It is derived from the amount of light\r\nor radio energy reflected or emitted by an object. If the object is not\r\na perfect light emitter, as most are not, then the light and radio\r\nenergy will be some fraction of that returned from a 100% efficient\r\nbody, and the object is really hotter than the brightness measurement\r\nshows. Thus, the brightness temperature is a minimum reading and in this\r\ncase, was lower than the actual surface temperature.\r\n\r\nMariner’s microwave radiometer showed no significant difference between\r\nthe light and dark sides of Venus and, importantly, higher temperatures\r\nalong the terminator or night-and-day line of the planet. These results\r\nwould indicate no ionosphere supercharged with electrons, but a definite\r\nlimb-darkening effect, since the edges were cooler than the center of\r\nthe planet.\r\n\r\nTherefore, considering the absorption characteristics of the atmosphere\r\nand the emissivity factor derived from earlier JPL radar experiments, a\r\nfairly uniform 800 degrees F was estimated as a preliminary temperature\r\nfigure for the entire surface.\r\n\r\nVenus is, indeed, a very hot planet.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLOUD TEMPERATURES: THE INFRARED READINGS\r\n\r\nMariner II took a close look at Venus’ clouds with its infrared\r\nradiometer during its 35-minute encounter with the planet. This\r\ninstrument was firmly attached to the microwave radiometer so the two\r\ndevices would scan the same areas of Venus at the same rate and the data\r\nwould be closely correlated. This arrangement was necessary to produce\r\nin effect a stereoscopic view of the planet from two different regions\r\nof the spectrum.\r\n\r\nBecause astronomers have long conjectured about the irregular dark spots\r\ndiscernible on the surface of Venus’ atmosphere, data to resolve these\r\nquestions would be of great scientific interest. If the spots were\r\nindeed breaks in the clouds, they would stand out with much better\r\ndefinition in the infrared spectrum. If the radiation came from the\r\ncloud tops, there would be no breaks and the temperatures at both\r\nfrequencies measured by the infrared radiometer would follow essentially\r\nthe same pattern.\r\n\r\nThe Venusian atmosphere is transparent to the 8-micron region of the\r\nspectrum except for clouds. In the 10-micron range, the lower atmosphere\r\nwould be hidden by carbon dioxide. If cloud breaks existed, the 8-micron\r\nemissions would come from a much lower point, since the lower atmosphere\r\nis fairly transparent at this wavelength. If increasing temperatures\r\nwere shown in this region, it might mean that some radiation was coming\r\nup from the surface.\r\n\r\nAs a result of the Mariner II mission, scientists have hypothecated that\r\nthe cold cloud cover could be about 15 miles thick, with the lower base\r\nbeginning about 45 miles above the surface, and the top occurring at 60\r\nmiles. In this case, the bottom of the cloud layer could be\r\napproximately 200 degrees F; at the top, the readings vary from about\r\nminus 30 degrees F in the center of the planet to temperatures of\r\nperhaps minus 60 degrees to minus 70 degrees F along the edges. This\r\ntemperature gradient would verify the limb-darkening effect seen by the\r\nmicrowave radiometer.\r\n\r\nAt the center of Venus, the radiometer saw a thicker, brighter, hotter\r\npart of the cloud layer; at the limbs, it could not see so deeply and\r\nthe colder upper layers were visible. Furthermore, the temperatures\r\nalong the cloud tops were approximately equally distributed, indicating\r\nthat both 8- and 10-micron “channels” penetrated to the same depth and\r\nthat both were looking at thick, dense clouds quite opaque to infrared\r\nradiation.\r\n\r\nBoth channels detected a curious feature along the lower portion of the\r\nterminator, or the center line between the night and day sides of the\r\nplanet. In that region, a spot was shown that was apparently about 20\r\ndegrees F colder than the rest of the cloud layer. Such an anomaly could\r\nresult from higher or more opaque clouds, or from such an irregularity\r\nas a hidden surface feature. A mountain could force the clouds upward,\r\nthus cooling them further, but it would have to be extremely high.\r\n\r\nThe data allow scientists to deduce that not enough carbon dioxide was\r\npresent above the clouds for appreciable absorption in the 10-micron\r\nregion. This effect would seem to indicate that the clouds are thick and\r\nthat there is little radiation coming up from the surface. And, if\r\npresent, water vapor content might be 1/1,000 of that in the Earth’s\r\natmosphere.\r\n\r\nSince the cloud base is apparently at a very high temperature, neither\r\ncarbon dioxide nor water is likely to be present in quantity. Rather,\r\nthe base of the clouds must contain some component that will condense in\r\nsmall quantities and not be spectroscopically detected.\r\n\r\nAs a result of the two radiometer experiments, the region below the\r\nclouds and the surface itself take on better definition. Certainly,\r\nheat-trapping of infrared radiation, or a “greenhouse” effect, must be\r\nexpected to support the 800 degree F surface temperature estimated from\r\nthe microwave radiometer data. Thus, a considerable amount of\r\nenergy-blanketing carbon dioxide must be present below the cloud base.\r\nIt is thought that some of the near-infrared sunlight might filter\r\nthrough the clouds in small amounts, so that the sky would not be\r\nentirely black, at least to human eyes, on the sunlit side of Venus.\r\nThere also may be some very small content of oxygen below the clouds,\r\nand perhaps considerable amounts of nitrogen.\r\n\r\nThe atmospheric pressure on the surface might be very high, about 20\r\ntimes the Earth’s atmosphere or more (equivalent to about 600 inches of\r\nmercury, compared with our 30 inches). The surface, despite the high\r\ntemperature, is not likely to be molten because of the roughness index\r\nseen in the earlier radar experiments, and other indicators. However,\r\nthe possibility of small molten metal lakes cannot be totally ignored.\r\n\r\nThe dense, high-pressure atmosphere and the heat-capturing greenhouse\r\neffect could combine over long periods of time to carry the extremely\r\nhigh temperature around to the dark side of Venus, despite the slow rate\r\nof rotation, possibly accounting for the relatively uniform surface\r\ntemperatures apparently found by Mariner II.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RADAR PROFILE: MEASUREMENTS FROM EARTH\r\n\r\nIn 1961, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory conducted a series of experiments\r\nfrom its Goldstone, California, DSIF Station, successfully bouncing\r\nradar signals off the planet Venus and receiving the return signal after\r\nit had travelled 70 million miles in 6½ minutes.\r\n\r\nIn order to complement the Mariner mission to Venus, the radar\r\nexperiments were repeated from October to December, 1962 (during the\r\nMariner mission), using improved equipment and refined techniques. As in\r\n1961, the experiments were directed by W. K. Victor and R. Stevens.\r\n\r\nThe 1961 experiments used two 85-foot antennas, one transmitting 13\r\nkilowatts of power at 2,388 megacycles, the other receiving the return\r\nsignal after the round trip to and from Venus. The most important result\r\nwas the refinement of the astronomical unit—the mean distance from the\r\nEarth to the Sun—to a value of 92,956,200 ±300 miles.\r\n\r\nAround 1910, the astronomical unit, plotted by classical optical\r\nmethods, was uncertain to 250,000 miles. Before the introduction of\r\nradar astronomy techniques such as those used at Goldstone, scientists\r\nbelieved that the astronomical unit was known to within 60,000 miles,\r\nbut even this factor of uncertainty would be intolerable for planetary\r\nexploration.\r\n\r\nIn radar astronomy, the transit time of a radio signal moving at the\r\nspeed of light (186,000 miles per second) is measured as it travels to a\r\nplanet and back. In conjunction with the angular measurement techniques\r\nused by earlier investigators, this method permits a more precise\r\ncalculation of the astronomical unit.\r\n\r\nOptical and radar measurements of the astronomical unit differ by 50,000\r\nmiles. Further refinement of both techniques should lessen the\r\ndiscrepancy between the two values.\r\n\r\nThe 1961 tests also established that Venus rotates at a very slow rate,\r\npossibly keeping the same face toward the Sun at all times. The\r\nreflection coefficient of the planet was estimated at 12%, a bright\r\nvalue similar to that of the Earth and contrasted with the Moon’s 2%.\r\nThe average dielectric constant (conductivity factor) of the surface\r\nmaterial seemed to be close to that of sand or dust, and the surface was\r\nreported to be rough at a wavelength of 6 inches.\r\n\r\nThe surface roughness was confirmed in 1962. Since it is known that a\r\nrough surface will scatter a signal, the radar tests were observed for\r\nsuch indications. Venus had a scattering effect on the radar waves\r\nsimilar to the Moon’s, probably establishing the roughness of the\r\nVenusian surface as more or less similar to the lunar terrain.\r\n\r\nSome of the most interesting work was done in reference to the rotation\r\nrate of Venus. A radar signal will spread in frequency on return from a\r\ntarget planet that is rotating and rough enough to reflect from a\r\nconsiderable area of its surface. The spread of 5 to 10 cycles per\r\nsecond noted on the Venus echo would suggest a very slow rotation rate,\r\nperhaps keeping the same face toward the Sun, or possibly even in a\r\nretrograde direction, opposite to the Earth’s.\r\n\r\nIn the Goldstone 1962 experiments, Venus was in effect divided into\r\nobservation zones and the doppler effect or change in the returned\r\nsignal from these zones was studied. The rate of rotation was derived\r\nfrom three months of sampling with this radar mapping technique. Also,\r\nthe clear, sharp tone characteristic of the transmitted radar signal was\r\naltered on return from Venus into a fuzzy, indistinct sound. This effect\r\nseemed to confirm the slow retrograde rotation (as compared with the\r\nEarth) indicated by the radar mapping and frequency change method.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these methods of deducing the slow rotation rate, two\r\nother phenomena seemed to verify it: a slowly fluctuating signal\r\nstrength, and the apparent progression of a bright radar spot across\r\nfrom the center of Venus toward the outside edge.\r\n\r\nAs a result, JPL scientists revised their 1961 estimate of an equal\r\nVenusian day and year consisting of 225 Earth days. The new value for\r\nVenus’ rotation rate around its axis is 230 Earth days plus or minus 40\r\nto 50 days, and in a retrograde direction (opposite to synchronous or\r\nSun-facing), assuming that Venus rotates on an axis perpendicular to the\r\nplane of its orbit.\r\n\r\nThus, on Venus the Sun would appear to rise in the west and cross to the\r\neast about once each Venusian year. If the period were exactly 225 days\r\nretrograde, the stars would remain stationary in the sky and Venus would\r\nalways face a given star rather than the Sun.\r\n\r\nA space traveller hovering several million miles directly above the Sun\r\nwould thus see Venus as almost stopped in its rotation and possibly\r\nturning very slowly clockwise. All the other planets of our system\r\nincluding the Earth, rotate counterclockwise, except Uranus, whose axis\r\nis almost parallel to the plane of its orbit, making it seem to roll\r\naround the Sun on its side. The rotation direction of distant Pluto is\r\nunknown.\r\n\r\nThe Goldstone experiments also studied what is known as the Faraday\r\nrotation of the plane of polarization of a radio wave. The results\r\nindicated that the ionization and magnetic field around Venus are very\r\nlow. These data tend to confirm those gathered by Mariner’s experiments\r\nclose to the planet.\r\n\r\nThe mass of Venus was another value that had never been precisely\r\nestablished. The mass of planetary bodies is determined by their\r\ngravitational effect on other bodies, such as satellites. Since Venus\r\nhas no known natural satellite or moon, Mariner, approaching closely\r\nenough to “feel” its gravity, would provide the first opportunity for\r\nclose measurement.\r\n\r\nThe distortion caused by Venus on Mariner’s trajectory as the spacecraft\r\npassed the planet enabled scientists to calculate the mass with an error\r\nprobability of 0.015%. The value arrived at is 0.81485 of the mass of\r\nthe Earth, which is known to be approximately 13.173 septillion\r\n(13,173,000,000,000,000,000,000,000) pounds. Thus, the mass of Venus is\r\napproximately 10.729 septillion (10,729,408,500,000,000,000,000,000)\r\npounds.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these measurements, the extremely precise tracking system\r\nused on Mariner proved the feasibility of long-range tracking in space,\r\nparticularly in radial velocity, which was measured to within 1/10 of an\r\ninch per second at a distance of about 54 million miles.\r\n\r\nAs the mission progressed, the trajectory was corrected with respect to\r\nVenus to within 10 miles at encounter. An interesting result was the\r\nvery precise location of the Goldstone and overseas tracking stations of\r\nthe DSIF. Before Mariner II, these locations were known to within 100\r\nyards. After all the data have been analyzed, these locations will be\r\nredefined or “relocated” to within an error of only 20 yards.\r\n\r\nMariner not only made the first successful journey to Venus—it also\r\nhelped pinpoint spots in the Californian and Australian deserts and the\r\nSouth African veldt with an accuracy never before achieved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER 10\r\n                         THE NEW LOOK OF VENUS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe historic mission of Mariner II to the near-vicinity of Venus and\r\nbeyond has enabled scientists to revise many of their concepts of\r\ninterplanetary space and the planet Venus.\r\n\r\nThe composite picture, taken from the six experiments aboard the\r\nspacecraft and the data from the DSIF radar experiments of 1961 and 1962\r\nrevealed the following:\r\n\r\n\r\n—Interplanetary space between the Earth and Venus, at least as it was\r\n  during the four months of Mariner’s mission, had a cosmic dust density\r\n  some ten-thousand times lower than the region immediately surrounding\r\n  the Earth.\r\n\r\n—During this period, the extremely tenuous, widely fluctuating solar\r\n  winds streamed continually out from the Sun, at velocities ranging\r\n  from 200 to 500 miles per second.\r\n\r\n—An astronaut travelling through these regions in the last quarter of\r\n  1962 would not have been seriously affected by the cosmic and\r\n  high-energy radiation from space and the Sun. He could easily have\r\n  survived many times the amount of radiation detected by Mariner’s\r\n  instruments.\r\n\r\n—111\r\n\r\n—The astronomical unit, as determined by radar, the yardstick of our\r\n  solar system, stands at 92,956,200, plus or minus 300 miles.\r\n\r\n—The mass of Venus in relation to the Earth’s is 0.81485, with an error\r\n  probability of 0.015%.\r\n\r\n—The rotation rate of Venus is quite slow and is now estimated as equal\r\n  to 230 Earth days, plus or minus 40 to 50 days. The rotation might be\r\n  retrograde, clockwise with respect to a Sun-facing reference, with the\r\n  Sun rising in the west and setting in the east approximately one\r\n  Venusian year later. The planet seems to remain nearly star-fixed\r\n  rather than permanently oriented with one face to the Sun.\r\n\r\n—Venus has no magnetic field discernible at the 21,598-mile approach of\r\n  Mariner II and at that altitude there were no regions of trapped\r\n  high-energy particles or radiation belts, as there are near the Earth.\r\n\r\n—The clouds of Venus are about 15 miles thick, extending from a base 45\r\n  miles above the surface to a top altitude of about 60 miles.\r\n\r\n—At the resolution of the Mariner II infrared radiometer, there were no\r\n  apparent breaks in the cloud cover. Cloud-top temperature readings are\r\n  about minus 30 degrees F near the center (along the terminator), and\r\n  ranging down to minus 60 degrees to minus 70 degrees F at the limbs,\r\n  showing an apparent limb-darkening effect, which would indicate a hot\r\n  surface and the absence of a supercharged ionosphere.\r\n\r\n—A spot 20 degrees F colder than the surrounding area exists along the\r\n  terminator in the southern hemisphere: a high mountain could exist in\r\n  this region, but such an hypothesis is purely conjectural. A bright\r\n  radar reflection is also found on the Equator in the same general\r\n  region. Causes of these phenomena are not established.\r\n\r\n—At their base, the clouds are about 200 degrees F and probably are\r\n  comprised of condensed hydrocarbons held in oily suspension. Below the\r\n  clouds, the atmosphere must be heavily charged with carbon dioxide,\r\n  may contain slight traces of oxygen, and probably has a strong\r\n  concentration of nitrogen.\r\n\r\n—112\r\n\r\n—As determined by the microwave radiometer, Venus’ surface temperature\r\n  averages approximately 800 degrees F on both light and dark sides of\r\n  the planet. Some roughness is indicated and the surface reflectivity\r\n  is equivalent to that of dust and sand. No water could be present at\r\n  the surface but there is some possibility of small lakes of molten\r\n  metal of one type or another.\r\n\r\n—Some reddish sunlight, in the filterable infrared spectrum, may find\r\n  its way through the 15-mile-thick cloud cover, but the surface is\r\n  probably very bleak.\r\n\r\n—The heavy, dense atmosphere creates a surface pressure of some twenty\r\n  times that found on the Earth, or equal to about 600 inches of\r\n  mercury.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe mission was completed and the spacecraft had gone into an endless\r\norbit around the Sun. But before Mariner II lost its sing-song voice, it\r\nproduced 13 million data words of computer space lyrics to accompany the\r\nmusic of the spheres.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                APPENDIX\r\n                             SUBCONTRACTORS\r\n\r\n\r\nThirty-four subcontractors to JPL provided instruments and other\r\nhardware for Mariners I and II.\r\n\r\nThe subcontractors were:\r\n\r\n  Aeroflex Corporation                 Jet vane actuators\r\n    Long Island City, New York\r\n  American Electronics, Inc.
