Permit me, my dear General, to offer you a picture\r\nrepresenting the Bastille as it was some days after I gave the order for\r\nits demolition. I also pay you the homage of sending you the principal\r\nKey of that fortress of despotism. It is a tribute I owe as a son to\r\nmy adoptive father, as aide-de-camp to my General, as a missionary of\r\nliberty to his Patriarch.\"\r\n\r\nThe Key was entrusted to Paine, and by him to J. Rut-ledge, Jr., who\r\nsailed from London in May. I have found in the manuscript despatches of\r\nLouis Otto, Chargé d' Affaires, several amusing paragraphs, addressed to\r\nhis govern-ment at Paris, about this Key.\r\n\r\n\"August 4, 1790. In attending yesterday the public audience of the\r\nPresident, I was surprised by a question from the Chief Magistrate,\r\n'whether I would like to see the Key of the Bastille?' One of his\r\nsecretaries showed me at the same moment a large Key, which had\r\nbeen sent to the President by desire of the Marquis de la Fayette. I\r\ndissembled my surprise in observing to the President that 'the time had\r\nnot yet come in America to do ironwork equal to that before him.'\r\nThe Americans present looked at the key with indifference, and as if\r\nwondering why it had been sent But the serene face of the President\r\nshowed that he regarded it as an homage from the French nation.\"\r\n\"December 13, 1790. The Key of the Bastille, regularly shown at the\r\nPresident's audiences, is now also on exhibition in Mrs. Washington's\r\n_salon_, where it satisfies the curiosity of the Philadelphians. I am\r\npersuaded, Monseigneur, that it is only their vanity that finds pleasure\r\nin the exhibition of this trophy, but Frenchmen here are not the less\r\npiqued, and many will not enter the President's house on this account.\"\r\n\r\nIn sending the key Paine, who saw farther than these distant Frenchmen,\r\nwrote to Washington: \"That the principles of America opened the Bastille\r\nis not to be doubted, and therefore the Key comes to the right place.\"\r\n\r\nEarly in May, 1791 (the exact date is not given), Lafayette writes\r\nWashington: \"I send you the rather indifferent translation of Mr. Paine\r\nas a kind of preservative and to keep me near you.\" This was a hasty\r\ntranslation of \"Rights of Man,\" Part I., by F. Soûles, presently\r\nsuperseded by that of Lanthenas.\r\n\r\nThe first convert of Paine to pure republicanism in France was Achille\r\nDuchâtelet, son of the Duke, and grandson of the authoress,--the friend\r\nof Voltaire. It was he and Paine who, after the flight of Louis XVI.,\r\nplacarded Paris with the Proclamation of a Republic, given as the first\r\nchapter of this volume. An account of this incident is here quoted from\r\nEtienne Dumont's \"Recollections of Mirabeau\":\r\n\r\n\"The celebrated Paine was at this time in Paris, and intimate in\r\nCondorcet's family. Thinking that he had effected the American\r\nRevolution, he fancied himself called upon to bring about one in France.\r\nDuchâtelet called on me, and after a little preface placed in my hand an\r\nEnglish manuscript--a Proclamation to the French People. It was nothing\r\nless than an anti-royalist Manifesto, and summoned the nation to\r\nseize the opportunity and establish a Republic. Paine was its author.\r\nDuchâtelet had adopted and was resolved to sign, placard the walls of\r\nParis with it, and take the consequences. He had come to request me to\r\ntranslate and develop it. I began discussing the strange proposal,\r\nand pointed out the danger of raising a republican standard without\r\nconcurrence of the National Assembly, and nothing being as yet known\r\nof the king's intentions, resources, alliances, and possibilities of\r\nsupport by the army, and in the provinces. I asked if he had consulted\r\nany of the most influential leaders,--Sieves, Lafayette, etc. He had\r\nnot: he and Paine had acted alone. An American and an impulsive nobleman\r\nhad put themselves forward to change the whole governmental system\r\nof France. Resisting his entreaties, I refused to translate the\r\nProclamation. Next day the republican Proclamation appeared on the walls\r\nin every part of Paris, and was denounced to the Assembly. The idea of\r\na Republic had previously presented itself to no one: this first\r\nintimation filled with consternation the Right and the moderates of the\r\nLeft. Malouet, Cazales, and others proposed prosecution of the author,\r\nbut Chapelier, and a numerous party, fearing to add fuel to the fire\r\ninstead of extinguishing it, prevented this. But some of the seed sown\r\nby the audacious hand of Paine were now budding in leading minds.\"\r\n\r\nA Republican Club was formed in July, consisting of five members, the\r\nothers who joined themselves to Paine and Duchâtelet being Condorcet,\r\nand probably Lanthenas (translator of Paine's works), and Nicolas de\r\nBonneville. They advanced so far as to print \"Le Républicain,\" of which,\r\nhowever, only one number ever appeared. From it is taken the second\r\npiece in this volume.\r\n\r\nEarly in the year 1792 Paine lodged in the house and book-shop of Thomas\r\n\"Clio\" Rickman, now as then 7 Upper Marylebone Street. Among his friends\r\nwas the mystical artist and poet, William Blake. Paine had become to\r\nhim a transcendental type; he is one of the Seven who appear in Blake's\r\n\"Prophecy\" concerning America (1793):\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"The Guardian Prince of Albion burns in his nightly tent\r\n  Sullen fires across the Atlantic glow to America's shore;\r\n  Piercing the souls of warlike men, who rise in silent night:--\r\n  Washington, Franklin, Paine, and Warren, Gates, Hancock, and Greene,\r\n  Meet on the coast glowing with blood from Albion's fiery Prince.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Seven are wrapt in the flames of their enthusiasm. Albion's Prince\r\nsends to America his thirteen Angels, who, however, there become\r\nGovernors of the thirteen States. It is difficult to discover from\r\nBlake's mystical visions how much political radicalism was in him, but\r\nhe certainly saved Paine from the scaffold by forewarning him (September\r\n13, 1792) that an order had been issued for his arrest. Without\r\nrepeating the story told in Gilchrist's \"Life of Blake,\" and in my \"Life\r\nof Paine,\" I may add here my belief that Paine also appears in one of\r\nBlake's pictures. The picture is in the National Gallery (London), and\r\ncalled \"The spiritual form of Pitt guiding Behemoth.\" The monster jaws\r\nof Behemoth are full of struggling men, some of whom stretch imploring\r\nhands to another spiritual form, who reaches down from a crescent\r\nmoon in the sky, as if to rescue them. This face and form appear to me\r\ncertainly meant for Paine.\r\n\r\nActing on Blake's warning Paine's friends got him off to Dover, where,\r\nafter some trouble, related in a letter to Dundas (see p. 41 of this\r\nvolume), he reached Calais. He had been elected by four departments to\r\nthe National Convention, and selected Calais, where he was welcomed\r\nwith grand civic parades. On September 19, 1792, he arrived in Paris,\r\nstopping at \"White's Hotel,\" 7 Passage des Pétits Pères, about five\r\nminutes' walk from the Salle de Manége, where, on September 21st, the\r\nNational Convention opened its sessions. The spot is now indicated by a\r\ntablet on the wall of the Tuileries Garden, Rue de Rivoli. On that\r\nday Paine was introduced to the Convention by the Abbé Grégoire, and\r\nreceived with acclamation.\r\n\r\nThe French Minister in London, Chauvelin, had sent to his government\r\n(still royalist) a despatch unfavorable to Paine's work in England, part\r\nof which I translate:\r\n\r\n\"May 23, 1792. An Association [for Parliamentary Reform, see pp. 78,\r\n93, of this volume] has been formed to seek the means of forwarding the\r\ndemand. It includes some distinguished members of the Commons, and a few\r\npeers. The writings of M. Payne which preceded this Association by a\r\nfew days have done it infinite harm. People suspect under the veil of\r\na reform long demanded by justice and reason an intention to destroy a\r\nconstitution equally dear to the peers whose privileges it consecrates,\r\nto the wealthy whom it protects, and to the entire nation, to which\r\nit assures all the liberty desired by a people methodical and slow in\r\ncharacter, and who, absorbed in their commercial interests, do not\r\nlike being perpetually worried about the imbecile George III. or public\r\naffairs. Vainly have the friends of reform protested their attachment\r\nto the Constitution. Vainly they declare that they desire to demand\r\nnothing, to obtain nothing, save in lawful ways. They are persistently\r\ndisbelieved. Payne alone is seen in all their movements; and this author\r\nhas not, like Mackintosh, rendered imposing his refutation of Burke. The\r\nmembers of the Association, although very different in principles, find\r\nthemselves involved in the now almost general disgrace of Payne.\"\r\n\r\nM. Noël writes from London, November 2, 1792, to the republican\r\nMinister, Le Brun, concerning the approaching trial of Paine, which had\r\nbeen fixed for December 18th.\r\n\r\n\"This matter above all excites the liveliest interest. People desire\r\nto know whether they live in a free country, where criticism even of\r\ngovernment is a right of every citizen. Whatever may be the decision in\r\nthis interesting trial, the result can only be fortunate for the cause\r\nof liberty. But the government cannot conceal from itself that it is\r\nsuspended over a volcano. The wild dissipations of the King's sons\r\nadd to the discontent, and if something is overlooked in the Prince of\r\nWales, who is loved enough, it is not so with the Duke of York, who\r\nhas few friends. The latter has so many debts that at this moment the\r\nreceivers are in his house, and the creditors wish even his bed to be\r\nseized. You perceive, Citizen, what a text fruitful in reflexions this\r\nconduct presents to a people groaning under the weight of taxes for the\r\nsupport of such whelps (_louvetaux_).\"\r\n\r\nUnder date of December 22, 1792, M. Noël writes:\r\n\r\n\"London is perfectly tranquil. The arbitrary measures taken by the\r\ngovernment in advance [of Paine's trial] cause no anxiety to the mass\r\nof the nation about its liberties. Some dear-headed people see well that\r\nthe royal prerogative will gain in this crisis, and that it is dangerous\r\nto leave executive power to become arbitrary at pleasure; but this very\r\nsmall number groan in silence, and dare not speak for fear of seeing\r\ntheir property pillaged or burned by what the miserable hirelings\r\nof government call 'Loyal Mob,' or 'Church and King Mob.' To the\r\n'Addressers,' of whom I wrote you, are added the associations for\r\nmaintaining the Constitution they are doing all they can to destroy.\r\nThere is no corporation, no parish, which is not mustered for this\r\nobject. All have assembled, one on the other, to press against\r\nthose whom they call 'The Republicans and the Levellers,' the most\r\ninquisitorial measures. Among other parishes, one (S. James' Vestry\r\nRoom) distinguishes itself by a decree worthy of the sixteenth century.\r\nIt promises twenty guineas reward to any one who shall denounce those\r\nwho in conversation or otherwise propagate opinions contrary to the\r\npublic tranquillity, and places the denouncer under protection of the\r\nparish. The inhabitants of London are now placed under a new kind of\r\n_Test_, and those who refuse it will undoubtedly be persecuted. Meantime\r\nthese papers are carried from house to house to be signed, especially by\r\nthose lodging as strangers. This _Test_ causes murmurs, and some try to\r\nevade signature, but the number is few. The example of the capital is\r\ngenerally followed. The trial of Payne, which at one time seemed likely\r\nto cause events, has ended in the most peaceful way. Erskine has been\r\nborne to his house by people shouting _God Save the King! Erskine\r\nforever!_ The friends of liberty generally are much dissatisfied with\r\nthe way in which he has defended his client. They find that he threw\r\nhimself into commonplaces which could make his eloquence shine, but\r\nguarded himself well from going to the bottom of the question. Vane\r\nespecially, a distinguished advocate and zealous democrat, is furious\r\nagainst Erskine. It is now for Payne to defend himself. But whatever\r\nhe does, he will have trouble enough to reverse the opinion. The Jury's\r\nverdict is generally applauded: a mortal blow is dealt to freedom of\r\nthought. People sing in the streets, even at midnight, _God save the\r\nKing and damn Tom Payne!_\" (1)\r\n\r\n     1 The despatches from which these translations are made are\r\n     in the Archives of the Department of State at Paris, series\r\n     marked _Angleterre_ vol. 581.\r\n\r\nThe student of that period will find some instruction in a collection,\r\nnow in the British Museum, of coins and medals mostly struck after the\r\ntrial and outlawry of Paine. A halfpenny, January 21,1793: _obverse_,\r\na man hanging on a gibbet, with church in the distance; motto \"End of\r\nPain\"; _reverse_, open book inscribed \"The Wrongs of Man.\" A token: bust\r\nof Paine, with his name; _reverse_, \"The Mountain in Labour, 1793.\"\r\nFarthing: Paine gibbeted; _reverse_, breeches burning, legend,\r\n\"Pandora's breeches\"; beneath, serpent decapitated by a dagger,\r\nthe severed head that of Paine. Similar farthing, but _reverse_,\r\ncombustibles intermixed with labels issuing from a globe marked\r\n\"Fraternity\"; the labels inscribed \"Regicide,\" \"Robbery,\" \"Falsity,\"\r\n\"Requisition\"; legend, \"French Reforms, 1797\"; near by, a church with\r\nflag, on it a cross. Half-penny without date, but no doubt struck in\r\n1794, when a rumor reached London that Paine had been guillotined:\r\nPaine gibbeted; above, devil smoking a pipe; _reverse_, monkey dancing;\r\nlegend, \"We dance, Paine swings.\" Farthing: three men hanging on a\r\ngallows; \"The three Thomases, 1796.\" _Reverse_, \"May the three knaves\r\nof Jacobin Clubs never get a trick.\" The three Thomases were Thomas\r\nPaine, Thomas Muir, and Thomas Spence. In 1794 Spence was imprisoned\r\nseven months for publishing some of Paine's works at his so-called\r\n\"Hive of Liberty.\" Muir, a Scotch lawyer, was banished to Botany Bay for\r\nfourteen years for having got up in Edinburgh (1792) a \"Convention,\" in\r\nimitation of that just opened in Paris; two years later he escaped from\r\nBotany Bay on an American ship, and found his way to Paine in Paris.\r\nAmong these coins there are two of opposite character. A farthing\r\nrepresents Pitt on a gibbet, against which rests a ladder; inscription,\r\n\"End of P [here an eye] T.\" _Reverse_, face of Pitt conjoined with that\r\nof the devil, and legend, \"Even Fellows.\" Another farthing like the\r\nlast, except an added legend, \"Such is the reward of tyrants, 1796.\"\r\nThese anti-Pitt farthings were struck by Thomas Spence.\r\n\r\nIn the winter of 1792-3 the only Reign of Terror was in England. The\r\nMinistry had replied to Paine's \"Rights of Man\" by a royal proclamation\r\nagainst seditious literature, surrounding London with militia, and\r\ncalling a meeting of Parliament (December, 1792) out of season.\r\nEven before the trial of Paine his case was prejudged by the royal\r\nproclamation, and by the Addresses got up throughout the country in\r\nresponse,--documents which elicited Paine's Address to the Addressers,\r\nchapter IX. in this volume. The Tory gentry employed roughs to burn\r\nPaine in effigy throughout the country, and to harry the Nonconformists.\r\nDr. Priestley's house was gutted. Mr. Fox (December 14, 1792) reminded\r\nthe House of Commons that all the mobs had \"Church and King\" for their\r\nwatchword, no mob having been heard of for \"The Rights of Man\"; and\r\nhe vainly appealed to the government to prosecute the dangerous libels\r\nagainst Dissenters as they were prosecuting Paine's work. Burke, who in\r\nthe extra session of Parliament for the first time took his seat on the\r\nTreasury Bench, was reminded that he had once \"exulted at the victories\r\nof that rebel Washington,\" and welcomed Franklin. \"Franklin,\" he said,\r\n\"was a native of America; Paine was born in England, and lived under the\r\nprotection of our laws; but, instigated by his evil genius, he conspired\r\nagainst the very country which gave him birth, by attempting to\r\nintroduce the new and pernicious doctrines of republicans.\"\r\n\r\nIn the course of the same harangue, Burke alluded to the English and\r\nIrish deputations, then in Paris, which had congratulated the Convention\r\non the defeat of the invaders of the Republic. Among them he named\r\nLord Semphill, John Frost, D. Adams, and \"Joel--Joel the Prophet\" (Joel\r\nBarlow). These men were among those who, towards the close of 1792,\r\nformed a sort of Paine Club at \"Philadelphia House\"--as White's Hotel\r\nwas now called. The men gathered around Paine, as the exponent of\r\nrepublican principles, were animated by a passion for liberty which\r\nwithheld no sacrifice. Some of them threw away wealth and rank as\r\ntrifles. At a banquet of the Club, at Philadelphia House, November 18,\r\n1792, where Paine presided, Lord Edward Fitzgerald and Sir Robert Smyth,\r\nBaronet, formally renounced their titles. Sir Robert proposed the toast,\r\n\"A speedy abolition of all hereditary titles and feudal distinctions.\"\r\nAnother toast was, \"Paine--and the new way of making good books known by\r\na Royal proclamation and a King's Bench prosecution.\"\r\n\r\nThere was also Franklin's friend, Benjamin Vaughan, Member of\r\nParliament, who, compromised by an intercepted letter, took refuge in\r\nParis under the name of Jean Martin. Other Englishmen were Rev. Jeremiah\r\nJoyce, a Unitarian minister and author (coadjutor of Dr. Gregory in\r\nhis \"Cyclopaedia \"); Henry Redhead Yorke, a West Indian with some negro\r\nblood (afterwards an agent of Pitt, under whom he had been imprisoned);\r\nRobert Merry, husband of the actress \"Miss Brunton\"; Sayer, Rayment,\r\nMacdonald, Perry.\r\n\r\nSampson Perry of London, having attacked the government in his journal,\r\n\"The Argus,\" fled from an indictment, and reached Paris in January,\r\n1793. These men, who for a time formed at Philadelphia House their\r\nParliament of Man, were dashed by swift storms on their several rocks.\r\nSir Robert Smyth was long a prisoner under the Reign of Terror, and died\r\n(1802) of the illness thereby contracted. Lord Edward Fitzgerald was\r\nslain while trying to kindle a revolution in Ireland. Perry was a\r\nprisoner in the Luxembourg, and afterwards in London. John Frost, a\r\nlawyer (struck off the roll), ventured back to London, where he was\r\nimprisoned six months in Newgate, sitting in the pillory at Charing\r\nCross one hour per day. Robert Merry went to Baltimore, where he died\r\nin 1798. Nearly all of these men suffered griefs known only to the \"man\r\nwithout a country.\"\r\n\r\nSampson Perry, who in 1796 published an interesting \"History of the\r\nFrench Revolution,\" has left an account of his visit to Paine in\r\nJanuary, 1793:\r\n\r\n\"I breakfasted with Paine about this time at the Philadelphia Hotel, and\r\nasked him which province in America he conceived the best calculated\r\nfor a fugitive to settle in, and, as it were, to begin the world with no\r\nother means or pretensions than common sense and common honesty. Whether\r\nhe saw the occasion and felt the tendency of this question I know not;\r\nbut he turned it aside by the political news of the day, and added that\r\nhe was going to dine with Petion, the mayor, and that he knew I should\r\nbe welcome and be entertained. We went to the mayoralty in a hackney\r\ncoach, and were seated at a table about which were placed the following\r\npersons: Petion, the mayor of Paris, with his female relation who did\r\nthe honour of the table; Dumourier, the commander-in-chief of the French\r\nforces, and one of his aides-de-camp; Santerre, the commandant of the\r\narmed force of Paris, and an aide-de-camp; Condorcet; Brissot; Gaudet;\r\nGenson-net; Danton; Rersaint; Clavière; Vergniaud; and Syèyes; which,\r\nwith three other persons, whose names I do not now recollect, and\r\nincluding Paine and myself, made in all nineteen.\"\r\n\r\nPaine found warm welcome in the home of Achille Du-châtelet, who with\r\nhim had first proclaimed the Republic, and was now a General. Madame\r\nDuchâtelet was an English lady of rank, Charlotte Comyn, and English was\r\nfluently spoken in the family. They resided at Auteuil, not far from the\r\nAbbé Moulet, who preserved an arm-chair with the inscription, _Benjamin\r\nFranklin hic sedebat_, Paine was a guest of the Duchâtelets soon after\r\nhe got to work in the Convention, as I have just discovered by a letter\r\naddressed \"To Citizen Le Brun, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Paris.\"\r\n\r\n\"Auteuil, Friday, the 4th December, 1792. I enclose an Irish newspaper\r\nwhich has been sent me from Belfast. It contains the Address of the\r\nSociety of United Irishmen of Dublin (of which Society I am a member)\r\nto the volunteers of Ireland. None of the English newspapers that I have\r\nseen have ventured to republish this Address, and as there is no other\r\ncopy of it than this which I send you, I request you not to let it go\r\nout of your possession. Before I received this newspaper I had drawn up\r\na statement of the affairs of Ireland, which I had communicated to my\r\nfriend General Duchâtelet at Auteuil, where I now am. I wish to confer\r\nwith you on that subject, but as I do not speak French, and as the\r\nmatter requires confidence, General Duchâtelet has desired me to say\r\nthat if you can make it convenient to dine with him and me at Auteuil,\r\nhe will with pleasure do the office of interpreter. I send this letter\r\nby my servant, but as it may not be convenient to you to give an answer\r\ndirectly, I have told him not to wait--Thomas Paine.\"\r\n\r\nIt will be noticed that Paine now keeps his servant, and drives to the\r\nMayor's dinner in a hackney coach. A portrait painted in Paris about\r\nthis time, now owned by Mr. Alfred Howlett of Syracuse, N. Y., shows him\r\nin elegant costume.\r\n\r\nIt is mournful to reflect, even at this distance, that only a little\r\nlater both Paine and his friend General Duchâtelet were prisoners. The\r\nlatter poisoned himself in prison (1794).\r\n\r\nThe illustrative notes and documents which it seems best to set before\r\nthe reader at the outset may here terminate. As in the previous volumes\r\nthe writings are, as a rule, given in chronological sequence, but an\r\nexception is now made in respect of Paine's religious writings, some of\r\nwhich antedate essays in the present volume. The religious writings\r\nare reserved for the fourth and final volume, to which will be added\r\nan Appendix containing Paine's poems, scientific fragments, and several\r\nletters of general interest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI. THE REPUBLICAN PROCLAMATION.(1)\r\n\r\n\"Brethren and Fellow Citizens:\r\n\r\n\"The serene tranquillity, the mutual confidence which prevailed amongst\r\nus, during the time of the late King's escape, the indifference with\r\nwhich we beheld him return, are unequivocal proofs that the absence of\r\na King is more desirable than his presence, and that he is not only a\r\npolitical superfluity, but a grievous burden, pressing hard on the whole\r\nnation.\r\n\r\n\"Let us not be imposed on by sophisms; all that concerns this is reduced\r\nto four points.\r\n\r\n\"He has abdicated the throne in having fled from his post. Abdication\r\nand desertion are not characterized by the length of absence; but by the\r\nsingle act of flight. In the present instance, the act is everything,\r\nand the time nothing.\r\n\r\n\"The nation can never give back its confidence to a man who, false to\r\nhis trust, perjured to his oath, conspires a clandestine flight, obtains\r\na fraudulent passport, conceals a King of France under the disguise of\r\na valet, directs his course towards a frontier covered with traitors\r\nand deserters, and evidently meditates a return into our country, with a\r\nforce capable of imposing his own despotic laws.\r\n\r\n\"Should his flight be considered as his own act, or the act of those\r\nwho fled with him? Was it a spontaneous resolution of his own, or was\r\nit inspired by others? The alternative is immaterial; whether fool or\r\nhypocrite, idiot or traitor, he has proved himself equally unworthy of\r\nthe important functions that had been delegated to him.\r\n\r\n     1 See Introduction to this volume. This manifesto with which\r\n     Paris was found placarded on July 1, 1791, is described by\r\n     Dumont as a \"Republican Proclamation,\" but what its literal\r\n     caption was I have not found.--_Editor_.\r\n\r\n\"In every sense in which the question can be considered, the reciprocal\r\nobligation which subsisted between us is dissolved. He holds no longer\r\nany authority. We owe him no longer obedience. We see in him no more\r\nthan an indifferent person; we can regard him only as Louis Capet.\r\n\r\n\"The history of France presents little else than a long series of public\r\ncalamity, which takes its source from the vices of Kings; we have been\r\nthe wretched victims that have never ceased to suffer either for them\r\nor by them. The catalogue of their oppressions was complete, but to\r\ncomplete the sum of their crimes, treason was yet wanting. Now the\r\nonly vacancy is filled up, the dreadful list is full; the system is\r\nexhausted; there are no remaining errors for them to commit; their reign\r\nis consequently at an end.\r\n\r\n\"What kind of office must that be in a government which requires for its\r\nexecution neither experience nor ability, that may be abandoned to the\r\ndesperate chance of birth, that may be filled by an idiot, a madman, a\r\ntyrant, with equal effect as by the good, the virtuous, and the wise? An\r\noffice of this nature is a mere nonentity; it is a place of show, not of\r\nuse. Let France then, arrived at the age of reason, no longer be deluded\r\nby the sound of words, and let her deliberately examine, if a King,\r\nhowever insignificant and contemptible in himself, may not at the same\r\ntime be extremely dangerous.\r\n\r\n\"The thirty millions which it costs to support a King in the eclat of\r\nstupid brutal luxury, presents us with an easy method of reducing taxes,\r\nwhich reduction would at once relieve the people, and stop the progress\r\nof political corruption. The grandeur of nations consists, not, as Kings\r\npretend, in the splendour of thrones, but in a conspicuous sense of\r\ntheir own dignity, and in a just disdain of those barbarous follies and\r\ncrimes which, under the sanction of Royalty, have hitherto desolated\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\n\"As to the personal safety of Louis Capet, it is so much the more\r\nconfirmed, as France will not stoop to degrade herself by a spirit of\r\nrevenge against a wretch who has dishonoured himself. In defending\r\na just and glorious cause, it is not possible to degrade it, and the\r\nuniversal tranquillity which prevails is an undeniable proof that a free\r\npeople know how to respect themselves.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII. TO THE AUTHORS OF \"LE RÉPUBLICAIN.\"(1)\r\n\r\n\r\nGentlemen:\r\n\r\nM. Duchâtelet has mentioned to me the intention of some persons to\r\ncommence a work under the title of \"The Republican.\"\r\n\r\nAs I am a Citizen of a country which knows no other Majesty than that of\r\nthe People; no other Government than that of the Representative body;\r\nno other sovereignty than that of the Laws, and which is attached to\r\n_France_ both by alliance and by gratitude, I voluntarily offer you my\r\nservices in support of principles as honorable to a nation as they are\r\nadapted to promote the happiness of mankind. I offer them to you with\r\nthe more zeal, as I know the moral, literary, and political character\r\nof those who are engaged in the undertaking, and find myself honoured in\r\ntheir good opinion.\r\n\r\nBut I must at the same time observe, that from ignorance of the French\r\nlanguage, my works must necessarily undergo a translation; they can of\r\ncourse be of but little utility, and my offering must consist more of\r\nwishes than services. I must add, that I am obliged to pass a part of\r\nthis summer in England and Ireland.\r\n\r\nAs the public has done me the unmerited favor of recognizing me under\r\nthe appellation of \"Common Sense,\" which is my usual signature, I shall\r\ncontinue it in this publication to avoid mistakes, and to prevent\r\nmy being supposed the author of works not my own. As to my political\r\nprinciples, I shall endeavour, in this letter, to trace their general\r\nfeatures in such a manner, as that they cannot be misunderstood.\r\n\r\n     1 \"Le Républicain; ou le Défenseur du gouvernement\r\n     Représentatif. Par une Société des Républicains. A Paris.\r\n     July, 1791.\" See Introduction to this volume.--_Editor_.\r\n\r\nIt is desirable in most instances to avoid that which may give even the\r\nleast suspicion as to the part meant to be adopted, and particularly\r\non the present occasion, where a perfect clearness of expression is\r\nnecessary to the avoidance of any possible misinterpretation. I am\r\nhappy, therefore, to find, that the work in question is entitled \"The\r\nRepublican.\" This word expresses perfectly the idea which we ought to\r\nhave of Government in general--_Res Publico_,--the public affairs of a\r\nnation.\r\n\r\nAs to the word _Monarchy_, though the address and intrigue of Courts\r\nhave rendered it familiar, it does not contain the less of reproach or\r\nof insult to a nation. The word, in its immediate or original sense,\r\nsignifies _the absolute power of a single individual_, who may prove\r\na fool, an hypocrite, or a tyrant. The appellation admits of no other\r\ninterpretation than that which is here given. France is therefore not a\r\n_Monarchy_; it is insulted when called by that name. The servile spirit\r\nwhich characterizes this species of government is banished from France,\r\nand this country, like AMERICA, can now afford to Monarchy no more than\r\na glance of disdain.\r\n\r\nOf the errors which monarchic ignorance or knavery has spread through\r\nthe world, the one which bears the marks of the most dexterous\r\ninvention, is the opinion that the system of _Republicanism_ is only\r\nadapted to a small country, and that a _Monarchy_ is suited, on the\r\ncontrary, to those of greater extent. Such is the language of Courts,\r\nand such the sentiments which they have caused to be adopted in\r\nmonarchic countries; but the opinion is contrary, at the same time, to\r\nprinciple and to experience.\r\n\r\nThe Government, to be of real use, should possess a complete knowledge\r\nof all the parties, all the circumstances, and all the interests of a\r\nnation. The monarchic system, in consequence, instead of being suited\r\nto a country of great extent, would be more admissible in a small\r\nterritory, where an individual may be supposed to know the affairs and\r\nthe interests of the whole. But when it is attempted to extend this\r\nindividual knowledge to the affairs of a great country, the capacity of\r\nknowing bears no longer any proportion to the extent or multiplicity of\r\nthe objects which ought to be known, and the government inevitably falls\r\nfrom ignorance into tyranny. For the proof of this position we need only\r\nlook to Spain, Russia, Germany, Turkey, and the whole of the Eastern\r\nContinent,--countries, for the deliverance of which I offer my most\r\nsincere wishes.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, the true _Republican_ system, by Election and\r\nRepresentation, offers the only means which are known, and, in my\r\nopinion, the only means which are possible, of proportioning the wisdom\r\nand the information of a Government to the extent of a country.\r\n\r\nThe system of _Representation_ is the strongest and most powerful center\r\nthat can be devised for a nation. Its attraction acts so powerfully,\r\nthat men give it their approbation even without reasoning on the cause;\r\nand France, however distant its several parts, finds itself at this\r\nmoment _an whole_, in its _central_ Representation. The citizen is\r\nassured that his rights are protected, and the soldier feels that he\r\nis no longer the slave of a Despot, but that he is become one of the\r\nNation, and interested of course in its defence.\r\n\r\nThe states at present styled _Republican_, as Holland, Genoa, Venice,\r\nBerne, &c. are not only unworthy the name, but are actually in\r\nopposition to every principle of a _Republican_ government, and the\r\ncountries submitted to their power are, truly speaking, subject to an\r\n_Aristocratic_ slavery!\r\n\r\nIt is, perhaps, impossible, in the first steps which are made in a\r\nRevolution, to avoid all kind of error, in principle or in practice, or\r\nin some instances to prevent the combination of both. Before the sense\r\nof a nation is sufficiently enlightened, and before men have entered\r\ninto the habits of a free communication with each other of their natural\r\nthoughts, a certain reserve--a timid prudence seizes on the human mind,\r\nand prevents it from obtaining its level with that vigor and promptitude\r\nthat belongs to _right_.--An example of this influence discovers\r\nitself in the commencement of the present Revolution: but happily this\r\ndiscovery has been made before the Constitution was completed, and in\r\ntime to provide a remedy.\r\n\r\nThe _hereditary succession_ can never exist as a matter of _right_; it\r\nis a _nullity_--a _nothing_. To admit the idea is to regard man as a\r\nspecies of property belonging to some individuals, either born or to\r\nbe born! It is to consider our descendants, and all posterity, as mere\r\nanimals without a right or will! It is, in fine, the most base and\r\nhumiliating idea that ever degraded the human species, and which, for\r\nthe honor of Humanity, should be destroyed for ever.\r\n\r\nThe idea of hereditary succession is so contrary to the rights of man,\r\nthat if we were ourselves to be recalled to existence, instead of being\r\nreplaced by our posterity, we should not have the right of depriving\r\nourselves beforehand of those _rights_ which would then properly belong\r\nto us. On what ground, then, or by what authority, do we dare to deprive\r\nof their rights those children who will soon be men? Why are we not\r\nstruck with the injustice which we perpetrate on our descendants, by\r\nendeavouring to transmit them as a vile herd to masters whose vices are\r\nall that can be foreseen.\r\n\r\nWhenever the _French_ constitution shall be rendered conformable to its\r\n_Declaration of Rights_, we shall then be enabled to give to France, and\r\nwith justice, the appellation of a _civic Empire_; for its government\r\nwill be the empire of laws founded on the great republican principles\r\nof _Elective Representation_, and the _Rights of Man_.--But Monarchy\r\nand Hereditary Succession are incompatible with the _basis_ of its\r\nconstitution.\r\n\r\nI hope that I have at present sufficiently proved to you that I am\r\na good Republican; and I have such a confidence in the truth of the\r\nprinciples, that I doubt not they will soon be as universal in _France_\r\nas in _America_. The pride of human nature will assist their evidence,\r\nwill contribute to their establishment, and men will be ashamed of\r\nMonarchy.\r\n\r\nI am, with respect, Gentlemen, your friend,\r\n\r\nThomas Paine.\r\n\r\nParis, June, 1791.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. TO THE ABBÉ SIÈYES.(1)\r\n\r\nParis, 8th July, 1791.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nAt the moment of my departure for England, I read, in the _Moniteur_\r\nof Tuesday last, your letter, in which you give the challenge, on\r\nthe subject of Government, and offer to defend what is called the\r\n_Monarchical opinion_ against the Republican system.\r\n\r\nI accept of your challenge with pleasure; and I place such a confidence\r\nin the superiority of the Republican system over that nullity of a\r\nsystem, called _Monarchy_, that I engage not to exceed the extent of\r\nfifty pages, and to leave you the liberty of taking as much latitude as\r\nyou may think proper.\r\n\r\nThe respect which I bear your moral and literary reputation, will be\r\nyour security for my candour in the course of this discussion; but,\r\nnotwithstanding that I shall treat the subject seriously and sincerely,\r\nlet me promise, that I consider myself at liberty to ridicule, as they\r\ndeserve, Monarchical absurdities, whensoever the occasion shall present\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nBy Republicanism, I do not understand what the name signifies in\r\nHolland, and in some parts of Italy. I understand simply a government\r\nby representation--a government founded upon the principles of the\r\nDeclaration of Rights; principles to which several parts of the French\r\nConstitution arise in contradiction. The Declaration of Rights of France\r\nand America are but one and the same thing in principles, and almost in\r\nexpressions; and this is the Republicanism which I undertake to defend\r\nagainst what is called _Monarchy_ and _Aristocracy_.\r\n\r\n     1 Written to the _Moniteur_ in reply to a letter of the Abbé\r\n     (July 8) elicited by Paine's letter to \"Le Républicain\"\r\n     (II.). The Abbé now declining a controversy, Paine dealt\r\n     with his views in \"Rights of Man,\" Part IL, ch. 3.--\r\n     _Editor_.\r\n\r\nI see with pleasure that in respect to one point we are already agreed;\r\nand _that is, the extreme danger of a civil list of thirty millions_. I\r\ncan discover no reason why one of the parts of the government should\r\nbe supported with so extravagant a profusion, whilst the other scarcely\r\nreceives what is sufficient for its common wants.\r\n\r\nThis dangerous and dishonourable disproportion at once supplies the one\r\nwith the means of corrupting, and throws the other into the predicament\r\nof being corrupted. In America there is but little difference, with\r\nregard to this point, between the legislative and the executive part of\r\nour government; but the first is much better attended to than it is in\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\nIn whatsoever manner, Sir, I may treat the subject of which you\r\nhave proposed the investigation, I hope that you will not doubt my\r\nentertaining for you the highest esteem. I must also add, that I am not\r\nthe personal enemy of Kings. Quite the contrary. No man more heartily\r\nwishes than myself to see them all in the happy and honourable state of\r\nprivate individuals; but I am the avowed, open, and intrepid enemy of\r\nwhat is called Monarchy; and I am such by principles which nothing can\r\neither alter or corrupt--by my attachment to humanity; by the anxiety\r\nwhich I feel within myself, for the dignity and the honour of the human\r\nrace; by the disgust which I experience, when I observe men directed by\r\nchildren, and governed by brutes; by the horror which all the evils that\r\nMonarchy has spread over the earth excite within my breast; and by those\r\nsentiments which make me shudder at the calamities, the exactions, the\r\nwars, and the massacres with which Monarchy has crushed mankind: in\r\nshort, it is against all the hell of monarchy that I have declared war.\r\n\r\nThomas Paine.(1)\r\n\r\n     1 To the sixth paragraph of the above letter is appended a\r\n     footnote: \"A deputy to the congress receives about a guinea\r\n     and a half daily: and provisions are cheaper in America\r\n     than in France.\" The American Declaration of Rights referred\r\n     to unless the Declaration of Independence, was no doubt,\r\n     especially that of Pennsylvania, which Paine helped to\r\n     frame.--Editor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Undated, but probably late in May, 1793.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nThough I have some reason for believing that you were not the original\r\npromoter or encourager of the prosecution commenced against the work\r\nentitled \"Rights of Man\" either as that prosecution is intended to\r\naffect the author, the publisher, or the public; yet as you appear\r\nthe official person therein, I address this letter to you, not as Sir\r\nArchibald Macdonald, but as Attorney General.\r\n\r\nYou began by a prosecution against the publisher Jordan, and the reason\r\nassigned by Mr. Secretary Dundas, in the House of Commons, in the debate\r\non the Proclamation, May 25, for taking that measure, was, he said,\r\nbecause Mr. Paine could not be found, or words to that effect. Mr.\r\nPaine, sir, so far from secreting himself, never went a step out of his\r\nway, nor in the least instance varied from his usual conduct, to avoid\r\nany measure you might choose to adopt with respect to him. It is on the\r\npurity of his heart, and the universal utility of the principles and\r\nplans which his writings contain, that he rests the issue; and he will\r\nnot dishonour it by any kind of subterfuge. The apartments which he\r\noccupied at the time of writing the work last winter, he has continued\r\nto occupy to the present hour, and the solicitors of the prosecution\r\nknew where to find him; of which there is a proof in their own office,\r\nas far back as the 21st of May, and also in the office of my own\r\nAttorney.(1)\r\n\r\n     1 Paine was residing at the house of one of his publishers,\r\n     Thomas Rickman, 7 Upper Marylebone Street, London. His\r\n     Attorney was the Hon. Thomas Erskine.--_Editor_.\r\n\r\nBut admitting, for the sake of the case, that the reason for proceeding\r\nagainst the publisher was, as Mr. Dundas stated, that Mr. Paine could\r\nnot be found, that reason can now exist no longer.\r\n\r\nThe instant that I was informed that an information was preparing to be\r\nfiled against me, as the author of, I believe, one of the most useful\r\nand benevolent books ever offered to mankind, I directed my Attorney\r\nto put in an appearance; and as I shall meet the prosecution fully and\r\nfairly, and with a good and upright conscience, I have a right to\r\nexpect that no act of littleness will be made use of on the part of the\r\nprosecution towards influencing the future issue with respect to the\r\nauthor. This expression may, perhaps, appear obscure to you, but I am\r\nin the possession of some matters which serve to shew that the action\r\nagainst the publisher is not intended to be a _real_ action. If,\r\ntherefore, any persons concerned in the prosecution have found their\r\ncause so weak, as to make it appear convenient to them to enter into\r\na negociation with the publisher, whether for the purpose of his\r\nsubmitting to a verdict, and to make use of the verdict so obtained as a\r\ncircumstance, by way of precedent, on a future trial against myself;\r\nor for any other purpose not fully made known to me; if, I say, I have\r\ncause to suspect this to be the case, I shall most certainly withdraw\r\nthe defence I should otherwise have made, or promoted on his (the\r\npublisher's) behalf, and leave the negociators to themselves, and shall\r\nreserve the whole of the defence for the _real_ trial.(1)\r\n\r\nBut, sir, for the purpose of conducting this matter with at least the\r\nappearance of fairness and openness, that shall justify itself before\r\nthe public, whose cause it really is, (for it is the right of public\r\ndiscussion and investigation that is questioned,) I have to propose to\r\nyou to cease the prosecution against the publisher; and as the reason\r\nor pretext can no longer exist for continuing it against him because\r\nMr. Paine could not be found, that you would direct the whole process\r\nagainst me, with whom the prosecuting party will not find it possible to\r\nenter into any private negociation.\r\n\r\n     1 A detailed account of the proceedings with regard to the\r\n     publisher will be found infra, in ix., Letter to the\r\n     Addressers.--_Editor_.\r\n\r\nI will do the cause full justice, as well for the sake of the nation, as\r\nfor my own reputation.\r\n\r\nAnother reason for discontinuing the process against the publisher is,\r\nbecause it can amount to nothing. First, because a jury in London cannot\r\ndecide upon the fact of publishing beyond the limits of the jurisdiction\r\nof London, and therefore the work may be republished over and over\r\nagain in every county in the nation, and every case must have a separate\r\nprocess; and by the time that three or four hundred prosecutions have\r\nbeen had, the eyes of the nation will then be fully open to see that the\r\nwork in question contains a plan the best calculated to root out all the\r\nabuses of government, and to lessen the taxes of the nation upwards of\r\n_six millions annually_.\r\n\r\nSecondly, Because though the gentlemen of London may be very expert in\r\nunderstanding their particular professions and occupations, and how\r\nto make business contracts with government beneficial to themselves as\r\nindividuals, the rest of the nation may not be disposed to consider them\r\nsufficiently qualified nor authorized to determine for the whole Nation\r\non plans of reform, and on systems and principles of Government. This\r\nwould be in effect to erect a jury into a National Convention, instead\r\nof electing a Convention, and to lay a precedent for the probable\r\ntyranny of juries, under the pretence of supporting their rights.\r\n\r\nThat the possibility always exists of packing juries will not be denied;\r\nand, therefore, in all cases, where Government is the prosecutor,\r\nmore especially in those where the right of public discussion and\r\ninvestigation of principles and systems of Government is attempted to be\r\nsuppressed by a verdict, or in those where the object of the work that\r\nis prosecuted is the reform of abuse and the abolition of sinecure\r\nplaces and pensions, in all these cases the verdict of a jury will\r\nitself become a subject of discussion; and therefore, it furnishes\r\nan additional reason for discontinuing the prosecution against the\r\npublisher, more especially as it is not a secret that there has been a\r\nnegociation with him for secret purposes, and for proceeding against\r\nme only. I shall make a much stronger defence than what I believe the\r\nTreasury Solicitor's agreement with him will permit him to do.\r\n\r\nI believe that Mr. Burke, finding himself defeated, and not being able\r\nto make any answer to the _Rights of Man_, has been one of the promoters\r\nof this prosecution; and I shall return the compliment to him by\r\nshewing, in a future publication, that he has been a masked pensioner at\r\n1500L. per annum for about ten years.\r\n\r\nThus it is that the public money is wasted, and the dread of public\r\ninvestigation is produced.\r\n\r\nI am, sir, Your obedient humble servant,\r\n\r\nThomas Paine.(1)\r\n\r\n     1 Paine's case was set down for June 8th, and on that day he\r\n     appeared in court; but, much to his disappointment, the\r\n     trial was adjourned to December 18th, at which time he was\r\n     in his place in the National Convention at Paris.--_Editor_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV. TO MR. SECRETARY DUNDAS.(1)\r\n\r\n\r\nLondon, June 6, 1793.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nAs you opened the debate in the House of Commons, May 25th, on the\r\nproclamation for suppressing publications, which that proclamation\r\n(without naming any) calls wicked and seditious: and as you applied\r\nthose opprobious epithets to the works entitled \"RIGHTS OF MAN,\" I think\r\nit unnecessary to offer any other reason for addressing this letter to\r\nyou.\r\n\r\nI begin, then, at once, by declaring, that I do not believe there are\r\nfound in the writings of any author, ancient or modern, on the subject\r\nof government, a spirit of greater benignity, and a stronger inculcation\r\nof moral principles than in those which I have published. They come,\r\nSir, from a man, who, by having lived in different countries, and\r\nunder different systems of government, and who, being intimate in\r\nthe construction of them, is a better judge of the subject than it is\r\npossible that you, from the want of those opportunities, can be:--And\r\nbesides this, they come from a heart that knows not how to beguile.\r\n\r\nI will farther say, that when that moment arrives in which the best\r\nconsolation that shall be left will be looking back on some past\r\nactions, more virtuous and more meritorious than the rest, I shall then\r\nwith happiness remember, among other things, I have written the RIGHTS\r\nOF MAN.---As to what proclamations, or prosecutions, or place-men,\r\nand place-expectants,--those who possess, or those who are gaping for\r\noffice,--may say of them, it will not alter their character, either with\r\nthe world or with me.\r\n\r\n     1 Henry D. (afterwards Viscount Melville), appointed\r\n     Secretary for the Home Department, 1791. In 1805 he was\r\n     impeached by the Commons for \"gross malversation\" while\r\n     Treasurer of the Navy; he was acquitted by the Lords\r\n     (1806), but not by public sentiment or by history.--\r\n     _Editor_.\r\n\r\nHaving, Sir, made this declaration, I shall proceed to remark, not\r\nparticularly on your speech on that occasion, but on any one to which\r\nyour motion on that day gave rise; and I shall begin with that of Mr.\r\nAdam.\r\n\r\nThis Gentleman accuses me of not having done the very thing that _I have\r\ndone_, and which, he says, if I _had_ done, he should not have accused\r\nme.\r\n\r\nMr. Adam, in his speech, (see the Morning Chronicle of May 26,) says,\r\n\r\n\"That he had well considered the subject of Constitutional Publications,\r\nand was by no means ready to say (but the contrary) that books of\r\nscience upon government though recommending a doctrine or system\r\ndifferent from the form of our constitution (meaning that of England)\r\nwere fit objects of prosecution; that if he did, he must condemn\r\nHarrington for his Oceana, Sir Thomas More for his Eutopia, and Hume\r\nfor his Idea of a perfect Commonwealth. But (continued Mr. Adam) the\r\npublication of Mr. Paine was very different; for it reviled what\r\nwas most sacred in the constitution, destroyed every principle of\r\nsubordination, and _established nothing in their room_.\"\r\n\r\nI readily perceive that Mr. Adam has not read the Second Part of _Rights\r\nof Man_, and I am put under the necessity, either of submitting to an\r\nerroneous charge, or of justifying myself against it; and certainly\r\nshall prefer the latter.--If, then, I shall prove to Mr. Adam, that in\r\nmy reasoning upon systems of government, in the Second Part of _Rights\r\nof Man_, I have shown as clearly, I think, as words can convey ideas, a\r\ncertain system of government, and that not existing in theory only,\r\nbut already in full and established practice, and systematically\r\nand practically free from all the vices and defects of the English\r\ngovernment, and capable of producing more happiness to the people, and\r\nthat also with an eightieth part of the taxes, which the present English\r\nsystem of government consumes; I hope he will do me the justice, when\r\nhe next goes to the House, to get up and confess he had been mistaken in\r\nsaying, that I had _established nothing, and that I had destroyed every\r\nprinciple of subordination_. Having thus opened the case, I now come to\r\nthe point.\r\n\r\nIn the Second Part of the Rights of Man, I have distinguished government\r\ninto two classes or systems: the one the hereditary system, the other\r\nthe representative system.\r\n\r\nIn the First Part of _Rights of Man_, I have endeavoured to shew, and\r\nI challenge any man to refute it, that there does not exist a right\r\nto establish hereditary government; or, in other words, hereditary\r\ngovernors; because hereditary government always means a government\r\nyet to come, and the case always is, that the people who are to live\r\nafterwards, have always the same right to choose a government for\r\nthemselves, as the people had who lived before them.\r\n\r\nIn the Second Part of _Rights of Man_, I have not repeated those\r\narguments, because they are irrefutable; but have confined myself to\r\nshew the defects of what is called hereditary government, or hereditary\r\nsuccession, that it must, from the nature of it, throw government into\r\nthe hands of men totally unworthy of it, from want of principle, or\r\nunfitted for it from want of capacity.--James the IId. is recorded as\r\nan instance of the first of these cases; and instances are to be found\r\nalmost all over Europe to prove the truth of the latter.\r\n\r\nTo shew the absurdity of the Hereditary System still more strongly, I\r\nwill now put the following case:--Take any fifty men promiscuously, and\r\nit will be very extraordinary, if, out of that number, one man should be\r\nfound, whose principles and talents taken together (for some might have\r\nprinciples, and others might have talents) would render him a person\r\ntruly fitted to fill any very extraordinary office of National Trust.\r\nIf then such a fitness of character could not be expected to be found\r\nin more than one person out of fifty, it would happen but once in a\r\nthousand years to the eldest son of any one family, admitting each, on\r\nan average, to hold the office twenty years. Mr. Adam talks of something\r\nin the Constitution which he calls _most sacred_; but I hope he does not\r\nmean hereditary succession, a thing which appears to me a violation of\r\nevery order of nature, and of common sense.\r\n\r\nWhen I look into history and see the multitudes of men, otherwise\r\nvirtuous, who have died, and their families been ruined, in the defence\r\nof knaves and fools, and which they would not have done, had they\r\nreasoned at all upon the system; I do not know a greater good that an\r\nindividual can render to mankind, than to endeavour to break the chains\r\nof political superstition. Those chains are now dissolving fast,\r\nand proclamations and persecutions will serve but to hasten that\r\ndissolution.\r\n\r\nHaving thus spoken of the Hereditary System as a bad System, and subject\r\nto every possible defect, I now come to the Representative System, and\r\nthis Mr. Adam will find stated in the Second Part of Rights of Man, not\r\nonly as the best, but as the only _Theory_ of Government under which the\r\nliberties of the people can be permanently secure.\r\n\r\nBut it is needless now to talk of mere theory, since there is already a\r\ngovernment in full practice, established upon that theory; or in other\r\nwords, upon the Rights of Man, and has been so for almost twenty years.\r\nMr. Pitt, in a speech of his some short time since, said, \"That there\r\nnever did, and never could exist a Government established upon those\r\nRights, and that if it began at noon, it would end at night.\" Mr. Pitt\r\nhas not yet arrived at the degree of a school-boy in this species of\r\nknowledge; his practice has been confined to the means of _extorting\r\nrevenue_, and his boast has been--_how much!_ Whereas the boast of the\r\nsystem of government that I am speaking of, is not how much, but how\r\nlittle.\r\n\r\nThe system of government purely representative, unmixed with any thing\r\nof hereditary nonsense, began in America. I will now compare the effects\r\nof that system of government with the system of government in England,\r\nboth during, and since the close of the war.\r\n\r\nSo powerful is the Representative system, first, by combining and\r\nconsolidating all the parts of a country together, however great the\r\nextent; and, secondly, by admitting of none but men properly qualified\r\ninto the government, or dismissing them if they prove to be otherwise,\r\nthat America was enabled thereby totally to defeat and overthrow all\r\nthe schemes and projects of the hereditary government of England against\r\nher. As the establishment of the Revolution and Independence of America\r\nis a proof of this fact, it is needless to enlarge upon it.\r\n\r\nI now come to the comparative effect of the two systems _since_ the\r\nclose of the war, and I request Mr. Adam to attend to it.\r\n\r\nAmerica had internally sustained the ravages of upwards of seven years\r\nof war, which England had not. England sustained only the expence of the\r\nwar; whereas America sustained not only the expence, but the destruction\r\nof property committed by _both_ armies. Not a house was built\r\nduring that period, and many thousands were destroyed. The farms and\r\nplantations along the coast of the country, for more than a thousand\r\nmiles, were laid waste. Her commerce was annihilated. Her ships were\r\neither taken, or had rotted within her own harbours. The credit of\r\nher funds had fallen upwards of ninety per cent., that is, an original\r\nhundred pounds would not sell for ten pounds. In fine, she was\r\napparently put back an hundred years when the war closed, which was not\r\nthe case with England.\r\n\r\nBut such was the event, that the same representative system of\r\ngovernment, though since better organized, which enabled her to conquer,\r\nenabled her also to recover, and she now presents a more flourishing\r\ncondition, and a more happy and harmonized society, under that system of\r\ngovernment, than any country in the world can boast under any other. Her\r\ntowns are rebuilt, much better than before; her farms and plantations\r\nare in higher improvement than ever; her commerce is spread over the\r\nworld, and her funds have risen from less than ten pounds the hundred to\r\nupwards of one hundred and twenty. Mr. Pitt and his colleagues talk\r\nof the things that have happened in his boyish administration, without\r\nknowing what greater things have happened elsewhere, and under other\r\nsystems of government.\r\n\r\nI now come to state the expence of the two systems, as they now stand\r\nin each of the countries; but it may first be proper to observe, that\r\ngovernment in America is what it ought to be, a matter of honour and\r\ntrust, and not made a trade of for the purpose of lucre.\r\n\r\nThe whole amount of the nett(sic) taxes in England (exclusive of the\r\nexpence of collection, of drawbacks, of seizures and condemnation, of\r\nfines and penalties, of fees of office, of litigations and informers,\r\nwhich are some of the blessed means of enforcing them) is seventeen\r\nmillions. Of this sum, about nine millions go for the payment of the\r\ninterest of the national debt, and the remainder, being about eight\r\nmillions, is for the current annual expences. This much for one side of\r\nthe case. I now come to the other.\r\n\r\nThe expence of the several departments of the general Representative\r\nGovernment of the United States of America, extending over a space\r\nof country nearly ten times larger than England, is two hundred and\r\nninety-four thousand, five hundred and fifty-eight dollars, which, at\r\n4s. 6d. per dollar, is 66,305L. 11s. sterling, and is thus apportioned;\r\n\r\n[Illustration: table046]\r\n\r\nOn account of the incursions of the Indians on the back settlements,\r\nCongress is at this time obliged to keep six thousand militia in pay, in\r\naddition to a regiment of foot, and a battalion of artillery, which it\r\nalways keeps; and this increases the expence of the War Department to\r\n390,000 dollars, which is 87,795L. sterling, but when peace shall be\r\nconcluded with the Indians, the greatest part of this expence will\r\ncease, and the total amount of the expence of government, including that\r\nof the army, will not amount to 100,000L. sterling, which, as has been\r\nalready stated, is but an eightieth part of the expences of the English\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nI request Mr. Adam and Mr. Dundas, and all those who are talking of\r\nConstitutions, and blessings, and Kings, and Lords, and the Lord\r\nknows what, to look at this statement. Here is a form and system of\r\ngovernment, that is better organized and better administered than any\r\ngovernment in the world, and that for less than one hundred thousand\r\npounds per annum, and yet every Member of Congress receives, as a\r\ncompensation for his time and attendance on public business, one pound\r\nseven shillings per day, which is at the rate of nearly five hundred\r\npounds a year.\r\n\r\nThis is a government that has nothing to fear. It needs no proclamations\r\nto deter people from writing and reading. It needs no political\r\nsuperstition to support it; it was by encouraging discussion and\r\nrendering the press free upon all subjects of government, that the\r\nprinciples of government became understood in America, and the people\r\nare now enjoying the present blessings under it. You hear of no riots,\r\ntumults, and disorders in that country; because there exists no cause\r\nto produce them. Those things are never the effect of Freedom, but of\r\nrestraint, oppression, and excessive taxation.\r\n\r\nIn America, there is not that class of poor and wretched people that\r\nare so numerously dispersed all over England, who are to be told by a\r\nproclamation, that they are happy; and this is in a great measure to\r\nbe accounted for, not by the difference of proclamations, but by the\r\ndifference of governments and the difference of taxes between that\r\ncountry and this. What the labouring people of that country earn, they\r\napply to their own use, and to the education of their children, and\r\ndo not pay it away in taxes as fast as they earn it, to support Court\r\nextravagance, and a long enormous list of place-men and pensioners;\r\nand besides this, they have learned the manly doctrine of reverencing\r\nthemselves, and consequently of respecting each other; and they laugh\r\nat those imaginary beings called Kings and Lords, and all the fraudulent\r\ntrumpery of Court.\r\n\r\nWhen place-men and pensioners, or those who expect to be such, are\r\nlavish in praise of a government, it is not a sign of its being a good\r\none. The pension list alone in England (see sir John Sinclair's History\r\nof the Revenue, p. 6, of the Appendix) is one hundred and seven thousand\r\nfour hundred and four pounds, _which is more than the expences of the\r\nwhole Government of America amount to_. And I am now more convinced than\r\nbefore, that the offer that was made to me of a thousand pounds for the\r\ncopy-right of the second part of the Rights of Man, together with the\r\nremaining copyright of the first part, was to have effected, by a quick\r\nsuppression, what is now attempted to be done by a prosecution. The\r\nconnection which the person, who made the offer, has with the King's\r\nprinting-office, may furnish part of the means of inquiring into this\r\naffair, when the ministry shall please to bring their prosecution to\r\nissue.(1) But to return to my subject.--\r\n\r\nI have said in the second part of the _Rights of Man_, and I repeat\r\nit here, that the service of any man, whether called King, President,\r\nSenator, Legislator, or any thing else, cannot be worth more to any\r\ncountry, in the regular routine of office, than ten thousand pounds per\r\nannum. We have a better man in America, and more of a gentleman, than\r\nany King I ever knew of, who does not occasion half that ex-pence; for,\r\nthough the salary is fixed at £5625 he does not accept it, and it is\r\nonly the incidental expences that are paid out of it.(2) The name by\r\nwhich a man is called is of itself but an empty thing. It is worth and\r\ncharacter alone which can render him valuable, for without these, Kings,\r\nand Lords, and Presidents, are but jingling names.\r\n\r\nBut without troubling myself about Constitutions of Government, I have\r\nshewn in the Second Part of _Rights of Man_, that an alliance may be\r\nformed between England, France, and America, and that the expences of\r\ngovernment in England may be put back to one million and a half, viz.:\r\n\r\n     Civil expence of Government...... 500,000L.\r\n     Army............................. 500,000\r\n     Navy............................. 500,000\r\n                                      ----------\r\n                                     1,500,000L.\r\n\r\nAnd even this sum is fifteen times greater than the expences of\r\ngovernment are in America; and it is also greater than the whole peace\r\nestablishment of England amounted to about an hundred years ago. So much\r\nhas the weight and oppression of taxes increased since the Revolution,\r\nand especially since the year 1714.\r\n\r\n     1 At Paine's trial, Chapman, the printer, in answer to fa\r\n     question of the Solicitor General, said: \"I made him three\r\n     separate offers in the different stages of the work; the\r\n     first, I believe, was a hundred guineas, the second five\r\n     hundred, and the last was a thousand.\"--_Editor_.\r\n\r\n     2 Error. See also ante, and in vol. ii., p. 435.\r\n     Washington had retracted his original announcement, and\r\n     received his salary regularly.--_Editor_.\r\n\r\nTo shew that the sum of 500,000L. is sufficient to defray all civil\r\nexpences of government, I have, in that work, annexed the following\r\nestimate for any country of the same extent as England.--\r\n\r\nIn the first place, three hundred Representatives, fairly elected, are\r\nsufficient for all the purposes to which Legislation can apply, and\r\npreferable to a larger number.\r\n\r\nIf, then, an allowance, at the rate of 500L. per annum be made to every\r\nRepresentative, deducting for non-attendance, the expence, if the whole\r\nnumber attended six months each year, would be.......75,000L.\r\n\r\nThe Official Departments could not possibly exceed the following number,\r\nwith the salaries annexed, viz.:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[ILLUSTRATION: Table]\r\n\r\nThree offices at\r\n 10,000L.\r\n each\r\n 30,000\r\n\r\nTen ditto at\r\n 5,000\r\n u\r\n 50,000\r\n\r\nTwenty ditto at\r\n 2,000\r\n u\r\n 40,000\r\n\r\nForty ditto at\r\n 1,000\r\n it\r\n 40,000\r\n\r\nTwo hundred ditto at\r\n 500\r\n u\r\n 100,000\r\n\r\nThree hundred ditto at  200\r\n u\r\n 60,000\r\n\r\nFive hundred ditto at\r\n 100\r\n u\r\n 50,000\r\n\r\nSeven hundred ditto at  75\r\n it\r\n 52,500\r\n\r\n497,500L.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf a nation chose, it might deduct four per cent, from all the offices,\r\nand make one of twenty thousand pounds per annum, and style the person\r\nwho should fill it, King or Madjesty, (1) or give him any other title.\r\n\r\nTaking, however, this sum of one million and a half, as an abundant\r\nsupply for all the expences of government under any form whatever,\r\nthere will remain a surplus of nearly six millions and a half out of\r\nthe present taxes, after paying the interest of the national debt; and\r\nI have shewn in the Second Part of _Rights of Man_, what appears to me,\r\nthe best mode of applying the surplus money; for I am now speaking of\r\nexpences and savings, and not of systems of government.\r\n\r\n     1 A friend of Paine advised him against this pun, as too\r\n     personal an allusion to George the Third, to whom however\r\n     much has been forgiven on account of his mental infirmity.\r\n     Yorke, in his account of his visit to Paine, 1802, alludes\r\n     to his (Paine's) anecdotes \"of humor and benevolence\"\r\n     concerning George III.--_Editor_.\r\n\r\nI have, in the first place, estimated the poor-rates at two millions\r\nannually, and shewn that the first effectual step would be to abolish\r\nthe poor-rates entirely (which would be a saving of two millions to the\r\nhouse-keepers,) and to remit four millions out of the surplus taxes to\r\nthe poor, to be paid to them in money, in proportion to the number of\r\nchildren in each family, and the number of aged persons.\r\n\r\nI have estimated the number of persons of both sexes in England, of\r\nfifty years of age and upwards, at 420,000, and have taken one third of\r\nthis number, viz. 140,000, to be poor people.\r\n\r\nTo save long calculations, I have taken 70,000 of them to be upwards of\r\nfifty years of age, and under sixty, and the others to be sixty years\r\nand upwards; and to allow six pounds per annum to the former class, and\r\nten pounds per annum to the latter. The expence of which will be,\r\n\r\n  Seventy thousand persons at 6L. per annum..... 420,000L.\r\n  Seventy thousand persons at 10L. per annum.... 700,000\r\n                                                -----------\r\n                                               1,120,000L.\r\n\r\nThere will then remain of the four millions, 2,880,000L. I have stated\r\ntwo different methods of appropriating this money. The one is to pay it\r\nin proportion to the number of children in each family, at the rate of\r\nthree or four pounds per annum for each child; the other is to apportion\r\nit according to the expence of living in different counties; but in\r\neither of these cases it would, together with the allowance to be\r\nmade to the aged, completely take off taxes from one third of all the\r\nfamilies in England, besides relieving all the other families from the\r\nburthen of poor-rates.\r\n\r\nThe whole number of families in England, allotting five souls to each\r\nfamily, is one million four hundred thousand, of which I take one third,\r\n_viz_. 466,666 to be poor families who now pay four millions of taxes,\r\nand that the poorest pays at least four guineas a year; and that the\r\nother thirteen millions are paid by the other two-thirds. The plan,\r\ntherefore, as stated in the work, is, first, to remit or repay, as is\r\nalready stated, this sum of four millions to the poor, because it is\r\nimpossible to separate them from the others in the present mode of\r\ncollecting taxes on articles of consumption; and, secondly, to abolish\r\nthe poor-rates, the house and window-light tax, and to change the\r\ncommutation tax into a progressive tax on large estates, the particulars\r\nof all which are set forth in the work, to which I desire Mr. Adam to\r\nrefer for particulars. I shall here content myself with saying, that to\r\na town of the population of Manchester, it will make a difference in its\r\nfavour, compared with the present state of things, of upwards of fifty\r\nthousand pounds annually, and so in proportion to all other places\r\nthroughout the nation. This certainly is of more consequence than that\r\nthe same sums should be collected to be afterwards spent by riotous\r\nand profligate courtiers, and in nightly revels at the Star and Garter\r\ntavern, Pall Mall.\r\n\r\nI will conclude this part of my letter with an extract from the Second\r\nPart of the _Rights of Man_, which Mr. Dundas (a man rolling in luxury\r\nat the expence of the nation) has branded with the epithet of \"wicked.\"\r\n\r\n\"By the operation of this plan, the poor laws, those instruments\r\nof civil torture, will be superseded, and the wasteful ex-pence of\r\nlitigation prevented. The hearts of the humane will not be shocked by\r\nragged and hungry children, and persons of seventy and eighty years of\r\nage begging for bread. The dying poor will not be dragged from place to\r\nplace to breathe their last, as a reprisal of parish upon parish. Widows\r\nwill have a maintenance for their children, and not be carted away, on\r\nthe death of their husbands, like culprits and criminals; and children\r\nwill no longer be considered as increasing the distresses of their\r\nparents. The haunts of the wretched will be known, because it will be\r\nto their advantage; and the number of petty crimes, the offspring of\r\npoverty and distress, will be lessened. The poor as well as the rich\r\nwill then be interested in the support of Government, and the cause and\r\napprehension of riots and tumults will cease. Ye who sit in ease, and\r\nsolace yourselves in plenty, and such there are in Turkey and Russia,\r\nas well as in England, and who say to yourselves, _are we not well off_\r\nhave ye thought of these things? When ye do, ye will cease to speak and\r\nfeel for yourselves alone.\"\r\n\r\nAfter this remission of four millions be made, and the poor-rates\r\nand houses and window-light tax be abolished, and the commutation\r\ntax changed, there will still remain nearly one million and a half\r\nof surplus taxes; and as by an alliance between England, France and\r\nAmerica, armies and navies will, in a great measure, be rendered\r\nunnecessary; and as men who have either been brought up in, or long\r\nhabited to, those lines of life, are still citizens of a nation in\r\ncommon with the rest, and have a right to participate in all plans of\r\nnational benefit, it is stated in that work (_Rights of Man_, Part ii.)\r\nto apply annually 507,000L. out of the surplus taxes to this purpose, in\r\nthe following manner:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: table 053]\r\n\r\nThe limits to which it is proper to confine this letter, will not admit\r\nof my entering into further particulars. I address it to Mr. Dundas\r\nbecause he took the lead in the debate, and he wishes, I suppose, to\r\nappear conspicuous; but the purport of it is to justify myself from the\r\ncharge which Mr. Adam has made.\r\n\r\nThis Gentleman, as has been observed in the beginning of this letter,\r\nconsiders the writings of Harrington, More and Hume, as justifiable and\r\nlegal publications, because they reasoned by comparison, though in so\r\ndoing they shewed plans and systems of government, not only different\r\nfrom, but preferable to, that of England; and he accuses me of\r\nendeavouring to confuse, instead of producing a system in the room of\r\nthat which I had reasoned against; whereas, the fact is, that I have\r\nnot only reasoned by comparison of the representative system against\r\nthe hereditary system, but I have gone further; for I have produced\r\nan instance of a government established entirely on the representative\r\nsystem, under which greater happiness is enjoyed, much fewer taxes\r\nrequired, and much higher credit is established, than under the system\r\nof government in England. The funds in England have risen since the war\r\nonly from 54L. to 97L. and they have been down since the proclamation,\r\nto 87L. whereas the funds in America rose in the mean time from 10L. to\r\n120L.\r\n\r\nHis charge against me of \"destroying every principle of subordination,\"\r\nis equally as groundless; which even a single paragraph from the work\r\nwill prove, and which I shall here quote:\r\n\r\n\"Formerly when divisions arose respecting Governments, recourse was had\r\nto the sword, and a civil war ensued. That savage custom is exploded\r\nby the new system, and _recourse is had to a national convention_.\r\nDiscussion, and the general will, arbitrates the question, and to\r\nthis private opinion yields with a good grace, and _order is preserved\r\nuninterrupted_.\"\r\n\r\nThat two different charges should be brought at the same time, the one\r\nby a Member of the Legislative, for _not_ doing a certain thing, and\r\nthe other by the Attorney General for _doing_ it, is a strange jumble of\r\ncontradictions. I have now justified myself, or the work rather, against\r\nthe first, by stating the case in this letter, and the justification of\r\nthe other will be undertaken in its proper place. But in any case the\r\nwork will go on.\r\n\r\nI shall now conclude this letter with saying, that the only objection\r\nI found against the plan and principles contained in the Second Part\r\nof _Rights of Man_, when I had written the book, was, that they would\r\nbeneficially interest at least ninety-nine persons out of every hundred\r\nthroughout the nation, and therefore would not leave sufficient room for\r\nmen to act from the direct and disinterested principles of honour; but\r\nthe prosecution now commenced has fortunately removed that objection,\r\nand the approvers and protectors of that work now feel the immediate\r\nimpulse of honour added to that of national interest.\r\n\r\nI am, Mr. Dundas,\r\n\r\nNot your obedient humble Servant,\r\n\r\nBut the contrary,\r\n\r\nThomas Paine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI. LETTERS TO ONSLOW CRANLEY,\r\n\r\nLord Lieutenant of the county of Surry; on the subject of the late\r\nexcellent proclamation:--or the chairman who shall preside at the\r\nmeeting to be held at Epsom, June 18.\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRST LETTER.\r\n\r\nLondon, June 17th, 1792.\r\n\r\nSIR,\r\n\r\nI have seen in the public newspapers the following advertisement, to\r\nwit--\r\n\r\n\"To the Nobility, Gentry, Clergy, Freeholders, and other Inhabitants of\r\nthe county of Surry.\r\n\r\n\"At the requisition and desire of several of the freeholders of the\r\ncounty, I am, in the absence of the Sheriff, to desire the favour of\r\nyour attendance, at a meeting to be held at Epsom, on Monday, the 18th\r\ninstant, at 12 o'clock at noon, to consider of an humble address to his\r\nmajesty, to express our grateful approbation of his majesty's paternal,\r\nand well-timed attendance to the public welfare, in his late most\r\ngracious Proclamation against the enemies of our happy Constitution.\r\n\r\n\"(Signed.) Onslow Cranley.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTaking it for granted, that the aforesaid advertisement, equally as\r\nobscure as the proclamation to which it refers, has nevertheless some\r\nmeaning, and is intended to effect some purpose; and as a prosecution\r\n(whether wisely or unwisely, justly or unjustly) is already commenced\r\nagainst a work intitled RIGHTS OF MAN, of which I have the honour and\r\nhappiness to be the author; I feel it necessary to address this letter\r\nto you, and to request that it may be read publicly to the gentlemen who\r\nshall meet at Epsom in consequence of the advertisement.\r\n\r\nThe work now under prosecution is, I conceive, the same work which is\r\nintended to be suppressed by the aforesaid proclamation. Admitting this\r\nto be the case, the gentlemen of the county of Surry are called upon by\r\nsomebody to condemn a work, and they are at the same time forbidden by\r\nthe proclamation to know what that work is; and they are further called\r\nupon to give their aid and assistance to prevent other people from\r\nknowing it also. It is therefore necessary that the author, for his own\r\njustification, as well as to prevent the gentlemen who shall meet from\r\nbeing imposed upon by misrepresentation, should give some outlines of\r\nthe principles and plans which that work contains.\r\n\r\nThe work, Sir, in question, contains, first, an investigation of general\r\nprinciples of government.\r\n\r\nIt also distinguishes government into two classes or systems, the one\r\nthe hereditary system; the other the representative system; and it\r\ncompares these two systems with each other.\r\n\r\nIt shews that what is called hereditary government cannot exist as a\r\nmatter of right; because hereditary government always means a government\r\nyet to come; and the case always is, that those who are to live\r\nafterwards have always the same right to establish a government for\r\nthemselves as the people who had lived before them.\r\n\r\nIt also shews the defect to which hereditary government is unavoidably\r\nsubject: that it must, from the nature of it, throw government into\r\nthe hands of men totally unworthy of it from the want of principle, and\r\nunfitted for it from want of capacity. James II. and many others are\r\nrecorded in the English history as proofs of the former of those cases,\r\nand instances are to be found all over Europe to prove the truth of the\r\nlatter.\r\n\r\nIt then shews that the representative system is the only true system of\r\ngovernment; that it is also the only system under which the liberties of\r\nany people can be permanently secure; and, further, that it is the\r\nonly one that can continue the same equal probability at all times of\r\nadmitting of none but men properly qualified, both by principles and\r\nabilities, into government, and of excluding such as are otherwise.\r\n\r\nThe work shews also, by plans and calculations not hitherto denied nor\r\ncontroverted, not even by the prosecution that is commenced, that the\r\ntaxes now existing may be reduced at least six millions, that taxes may\r\nbe entirely taken off from the poor, who are computed at one third of\r\nthe nation; and that taxes on the other two thirds may be considerably\r\nreduced; that the aged poor may be comfortably provided for, and the\r\nchildren of poor families properly educated; that fifteen thousand\r\nsoldiers, and the same number of sailors, may be allowed three\r\nshillings per week during life out of the surplus taxes; and also that a\r\nproportionate allowance may be made to the officers, and the pay of the\r\nremaining soldiers and sailors be raised; and that it is better to apply\r\nthe surplus taxes to those purposes, than to consume them on lazy and\r\nprofligate placemen and pensioners; and that the revenue, said to be\r\ntwenty thousand pounds per annum, raised by a tax upon coals, and given\r\nto the Duke of Richmond, is a gross imposition upon all the people of\r\nLondon, and ought to be instantly abolished.\r\n\r\nThis, Sir, is a concise abstract of the principles and plans contained\r\nin the work that is now prosecuted, and for the suppression of which the\r\nproclamation appears to be intended; but as it is impossible that I can,\r\nin the compass of a letter, bring into view all the matters contained\r\nin the work, and as it is proper that the gentlemen who may compose that\r\nmeeting should know what the merits or demerits of it are, before they\r\ncome to any resolutions, either directly or indirectly relating thereto,\r\nI request the honour of presenting them with one hundred copies of the\r\nsecond part of the Rights of Man, and also one thousand copies of my\r\nletter to Mr. Dundas, which I have directed to be sent to Epsom for that\r\npurpose; and I beg the favour of the Chairman to take the trouble of\r\npresenting them to the gentlemen who shall meet on that occasion, with\r\nmy sincere wishes for their happiness, and for that of the nation in\r\ngeneral.\r\n\r\nHaving now closed thus much of the subject of my letter, I next come\r\nto speak of what has relation to me personally. I am well aware of the\r\ndelicacy that attends it, but the purpose of calling the meeting appears\r\nto me so inconsistent with that justice that is always due between man\r\nand man, that it is proper I should (as well on account of the gentlemen\r\nwho may meet, as on my own account) explain myself fully and candidly\r\nthereon.\r\n\r\nI have already informed the gentlemen, that a prosecution is commenced\r\nagainst a work of which I have the honour and happiness to be the\r\nauthor; and I have good reasons for believing that the proclamation\r\nwhich the gentlemen are called to consider, and to present an address\r\nupon, is purposely calculated to give an impression to the jury before\r\nwhom that matter is to come. In short, that it is dictating a verdict by\r\nproclamation; and I consider the instigators of the meeting to be held\r\nat Epsom, as aiding and abetting the same improper, and, in my opinion,\r\nillegal purpose, and that in a manner very artfully contrived, as I\r\nshall now shew.\r\n\r\nHad a meeting been called of the Freeholders of the county of Middlesex,\r\nthe gentlemen who had composed that meeting would have rendered\r\nthemselves objectionable as persons to serve on a Jury, before whom the\r\njudicial case was afterwards to come. But by calling a meeting out\r\nof the county of Middlesex, that matter is artfully avoided, and the\r\ngentlemen of Surry are summoned, as if it were intended thereby to give\r\na tone to the sort of verdict which the instigators of the meeting no\r\ndoubt wish should be brought in, and to give countenance to the Jury in\r\nso doing. I am, sir,\r\n\r\nWith much respect to the\r\n\r\nGentlemen who shall meet, Their and your obedient and humble Servant,\r\n\r\nThomas Paine.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ONSLOW CRANLEY,\r\n\r\nCOMMONLY CALLED LORD ONSLOW.\r\n\r\nSECOND LETTER. SIR,\r\n\r\nLondon, June 21st 1792.\r\n\r\nWHEN I wrote you the letter which Mr. Home Tooke did me the favour to\r\npresent to you, as chairman of the meeting held at Epsom, Monday, June\r\n18, it was not with much expectation that you would do me the justice of\r\npermitting, or recommending it to be publicly read. I am well aware that\r\nthe signature of Thomas Paine has something in it dreadful to sinecure\r\nPlacemen and Pensioners; and when you, on seeing the letter opened,\r\ninformed the meeting that it was signed Thomas Paine, and added in a\r\nnote of exclamation, \"the common enemy of us all.\" you spoke one of the\r\ngreatest truths you ever uttered, if you confine the expression to\r\nmen of the same description with yourself; men living in indolence and\r\nluxury, on the spoil and labours of the public.\r\n\r\nThe letter has since appeared in the \"Argus,\" and probably in other\r\npapers.(1) It will justify itself; but if any thing on that account\r\nhath been wanting, your conduct at the meeting would have supplied\r\nthe omission. You there sufficiently proved that I was not mistaken in\r\nsupposing that the meeting was called to give an indirect aid to the\r\nprosecution commenced against a work, the reputation of which will long\r\noutlive the memory of the Pensioner I am writing to.\r\n\r\nWhen meetings, Sir, are called by the partisans of the Court, to\r\npreclude the nation the right of investigating systems and principles\r\nof government, and of exposing errors and defects, under the pretence\r\nof prosecuting an individual--it furnishes an additional motive for\r\nmaintaining sacred that violated right.\r\n\r\nThe principles and arguments contained in the work in question, _Rights\r\nOF Man_, have stood, and they now stand, and I believe ever will stand,\r\nunrefuted. They are stated in a fair and open manner to the world, and\r\nthey have already received the public approbation of a greater number of\r\nmen, of the best of characters, of every denomination of religion, and\r\nof every rank in life, (placemen and pensioners excepted,) than all the\r\njuries that shall meet in England, for ten years to come, will amount\r\nto; and I have, moreover, good reasons for believing that the approvers\r\nof that work, as well private as public, are already more numerous than\r\nall the present electors throughout the nation.\r\n\r\n     1 The _Argus_ was edited by Sampson Perry, soon after\r\n     prosecuted.--_Editor_.\r\n\r\nNot less than forty pamphlets, intended as answers thereto, have\r\nappeared, and as suddenly disappeared: scarcely are the titles of any of\r\nthem remembered, notwithstanding their endeavours have been aided by all\r\nthe daily abuse which the Court and Ministerial newspapers, for almost\r\na year and a half, could bestow, both upon the work and the author;\r\nand now that every attempt to refute, and every abuse has failed,\r\nthe invention of calling the work a libel has been hit upon, and the\r\ndiscomfited party has pusillanimously retreated to prosecution and a\r\njury, and obscure addresses.\r\n\r\nAs I well know that a long letter from me will not be agreeable to you,\r\nI will relieve your uneasiness by making it as short as I conveniently\r\ncan; and will conclude it with taking up the subject at that part where\r\nMr. HORNE TOOKE was interrupted from going on when at the meeting.\r\n\r\nThat gentleman was stating, that the situation you stood in rendered it\r\nimproper for you to appear _actively_ in a scene in which your private\r\ninterest was too visible: that you were a Bedchamber Lord at a thousand\r\na year, and a Pensioner at three thousand pounds a year more--and here\r\nhe was stopped by the little but noisy circle you had collected round.\r\nPermit me then, Sir, to add an explanation to his words, for the benefit\r\nof your neighbours, and with which, and a few observations, I shall\r\nclose my letter.\r\n\r\nWhen it was reported in the English Newspapers, some short time since,\r\nthat the empress of RUSSIA had given to one of her minions a large tract\r\nof country and several thousands of peasants as property, it very justly\r\nprovoked indignation and abhorrence in those who heard it. But if we\r\ncompare the mode practised in England, with that which appears to us so\r\nabhorrent in Russia, it will be found to amount to very near the same\r\nthing;--for example--\r\n\r\nAs the whole of the revenue in England is drawn by taxes from the\r\npockets of the people, those things called gifts and grants (of which\r\nkind are all pensions and sinecure places) are paid out of that stock.\r\nThe difference, therefore, between the two modes is, that in England the\r\nmoney is collected by the government, and then given to the Pensioner,\r\nand in Russia he is left to collect it for himself. The smallest sum\r\nwhich the poorest family in a county so near London as Surry, can be\r\nsupposed to pay annually, of taxes, is not less than five pounds; and as\r\nyour sinecure of one thousand, and pension of three thousand per annum,\r\nare made up of taxes paid by eight hundred such poor families, it comes\r\nto the same thing as if the eight hundred families had been given to\r\nyou, as in Russia, and you had collected the money on your account.\r\nWere you to say that you are not quartered particularly on the people\r\nof Surrey, but on the nation at large, the objection would amount to\r\nnothing; for as there are more pensioners than counties, every one may\r\nbe considered as quartered on that in which he lives.\r\n\r\nWhat honour or happiness you can derive from being the PRINCIPAL PAUPER\r\nof the neighbourhood, and occasioning a greater expence than the poor,\r\nthe aged, and the infirm, for ten miles round you, I leave you to enjoy.\r\nAt the same time I can see that it is no wonder you should be strenuous\r\nin suppressing a book which strikes at the root of those abuses. No\r\nwonder that you should be against reforms, against the freedom of the\r\npress, and the right of investigation. To you, and to others of your\r\ndescription, these are dreadful things; but you should also consider,\r\nthat the motives which prompt you to _act_, ought, by reflection, to\r\ncompel you to be _silent_.\r\n\r\nHaving now returned your compliment, and sufficiently tired your\r\npatience, I take my leave of you, with mentioning, that if you had not\r\nprevented my former letter from being read at the meeting, you would not\r\nhave had the trouble of reading this; and also with requesting, that\r\nthe next time you call me \"_a common enemy_,\" you would add, \"_of us\r\nsinecure placemen and pensioners_.\"\r\n\r\nI am, Sir, &c. &c. &c.\r\n\r\nThomas Paine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII. TO THE SHERIFF OF THE COUNTY OF SUSSEX,\r\n\r\nOR, THE GENTLEMAN WHO SHALL PRESIDE AT THE MEETING TO BE HELD AT LEWES,\r\nJULY 4.\r\n\r\nLondon, June 30, 1792.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nI have seen in the Lewes newspapers, of June 25, an advertisement,\r\nsigned by sundry persons, and also by the sheriff, for holding a meeting\r\nat the Town-hall of Lewes, for the purpose, as the advertisement states,\r\nof presenting an Address on the late Proclamation for suppressing\r\nwritings, books, &c. And as I conceive that a certain publication\r\nof mine, entitled \"Rights of Man,\" in which, among other things, the\r\nenormous increase of taxes, placemen, and pensioners, is shewn to be\r\nunnecessary and oppressive, _is the particular writing alluded to in\r\nthe said publication_; I request the Sheriff, or in his absence, whoever\r\nshall preside at the meeting, or any other person, to read this letter\r\npublicly to the company who shall assemble in consequence of that\r\nadvertisement.\r\n\r\nGentlemen--It is now upwards of eighteen years since I was a resident\r\ninhabitant of the town of Lewes. My situation among you, as an officer\r\nof the revenue, for more than six years, enabled me to see into the\r\nnumerous and various distresses which the weight of taxes even at that\r\ntime of day occasioned; and feeling, as I then did, and as it is natural\r\nfor me to do, for the hard condition of others, it is with pleasure I\r\ncan declare, and every person then under my survey, and now living, can\r\nwitness, the exceeding candour, and even tenderness, with which that\r\npart of the duty that fell to my share was executed. The name of _Thomas\r\nPaine_ is not to be found in the records of the Lewes' justices, in any\r\none act of contention with, or severity of any kind whatever towards,\r\nthe persons whom he surveyed, either in the town, or in the country;\r\nof this, _Mr. Fuller_ and _Mr. Shelley_, who will probably attend the\r\nmeeting, can, if they please, give full testimony. It is, however, not\r\nin their power to contradict it.\r\n\r\nHaving thus indulged myself in recollecting a place where I formerly\r\nhad, and even now have, many friends, rich and poor, and most probably\r\nsome enemies, I proceed to the more important purport of my letter.\r\n\r\nSince my departure from Lewes, fortune or providence has thrown me\r\ninto a line of action, which my first setting out into life could not\r\npossibly have suggested to me.\r\n\r\nI have seen the fine and fertile country of America ravaged and deluged\r\nin blood, and the taxes of England enormously increased and multiplied\r\nin consequence thereof; and this, in a great measure, by the instigation\r\nof the same class of placemen, pensioners, and Court dependants, who\r\nare now promoting addresses throughout England, on the present\r\n_unintelligible_ Proclamation.\r\n\r\nI have also seen a system of Government rise up in that country, free\r\nfrom corruption, and now administered over an extent of territory ten\r\ntimes as large as England, _for less expence than the pensions alone in\r\nEngland amount to_; and under which more freedom is enjoyed, and a more\r\nhappy state of society is preserved, and a more general prosperity is\r\npromoted, than under any other system of Government now existing in the\r\nworld. Knowing, as I do, the things I now declare, I should reproach\r\nmyself with want of duty and affection to mankind, were I not in the\r\nmost undismayed manner to publish them, as it were, on the house-tops,\r\nfor the good of others.\r\n\r\nHaving thus glanced at what has passed within my knowledge, since my\r\nleaving Lewes, I come to the subject more immediately before the meeting\r\nnow present.\r\n\r\nMr. Edmund Burke, who, as I shall show, in a future publication, has\r\nlived a concealed pensioner, at the expence of the public, of fifteen\r\nhundred pounds per annum, for about ten years last past, published a\r\nbook the winter before last, in open violation of the principles of\r\nliberty, and for which he was applauded by that class of men _who are\r\nnow promoting addresses_. Soon after his book appeared, I published the\r\nfirst part of the work, entitled \"Rights of Man,\" as an answer thereto,\r\nand had the happiness of receiving the public thanks of several bodies\r\nof men, and of numerous individuals of the best character, of every\r\ndenomination in religion, and of every rank in life--placemen and\r\npensioners excepted.\r\n\r\nIn February last, I published the Second Part of \"Rights of Man,\" and as\r\nit met with still greater approbation from the true friends of national\r\nfreedom, and went deeper into the system of Government, and exposed the\r\nabuses of it, more than had been done in the First Part, it consequently\r\nexcited an alarm among all those, who, insensible of the burthen of\r\ntaxes which the general mass of the people sustain, are living in luxury\r\nand indolence, and hunting after Court preferments, sinecure places, and\r\npensions, either for themselves, or for their family connections.\r\n\r\nI have shewn in that work, that the taxes may be reduced at least _six\r\nmillions_, and even then the expences of Government in England would be\r\ntwenty times greater than they are in the country I have already spoken\r\nof. That taxes may be entirely taken off from the poor, by remitting to\r\nthem in money at the rate of between _three and four pounds_ per head\r\nper annum, for the education and bringing up of the children of the poor\r\nfamilies, who are computed at one third of the whole nation, and _six\r\npounds_ per annum to all poor persons, decayed tradesmen, or others,\r\nfrom the age of fifty until sixty, and _ten pounds_ per annum from after\r\nsixty. And that in consequence of this allowance, to be paid out of the\r\nsurplus taxes, the poor-rates would become unnecessary, and that it is\r\nbetter to apply the surplus taxes to these beneficent purposes, _than to\r\nwaste them on idle and profligate courtiers, placemen, and pensioners_.\r\n\r\nThese, gentlemen, are a part of the plans and principles contained in\r\nthe work, which this meeting is now called upon, in an indirect manner,\r\nto vote an address against, and brand with the name of _wicked and\r\nseditious_. But that the work may speak for itself, I request leave to\r\nclose this part of my letter with an extract therefrom, in the following\r\nwords: [_Quotation the same as that on p. 26_.]\r\n\r\nGentlemen, I have now stated to you such matters as appear necessary\r\nto me to offer to the consideration of the meeting. I have no other\r\ninterest in what I am doing, nor in writing you this letter, than the\r\ninterest of the _heart_. I consider the proposed address as calculated\r\nto give countenance to placemen, pensioners, enormous taxation, and\r\ncorruption. Many of you will recollect, that whilst I resided among you,\r\nthere was not a man more firm and open in supporting the principles of\r\nliberty than myself, and I still pursue, and ever will, the same path.\r\n\r\nI have, Gentlemen, only one request to make, which is--that those\r\nwho have called the meeting will speak _out_, and say, whether in\r\nthe address they are going to present against publications, which the\r\nproclamation calls wicked, they mean the work entitled _Rights of Man_,\r\nor whether they do not?\r\n\r\nI am, Gentlemen, With sincere wishes for your happiness,\r\n\r\nYour friend and Servant,\r\n\r\nThomas Paine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII. TO MR. SECRETARY DUNDAS.\r\n\r\nCalais, Sept. 15, 1792.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nI CONCEIVE it necessary to make you acquainted with the following\r\ncircumstance:--The department of Calais having elected me a member\r\nof the National Convention of France, I set off from London the 13th\r\ninstant, in company with Mr. Frost, of Spring Garden, and Mr. Audibert,\r\none of the municipal officers of Calais, who brought me the certificate\r\nof my being elected. We had not arrived more, I believe, than five\r\nminutes at the York Hotel, at Dover, when the train of circumstances\r\nbegan that I am going to relate. We had taken our baggage out of the\r\ncarriage, and put it into a room, into which we went. Mr. Frost, having\r\noccasion to go out, was stopped in the passage by a gentleman, who told\r\nhim he must return into the room, which he did, and the gentleman came\r\nin with him, and shut the door. I had remained in the room; Mr. Audibert\r\nwas gone to inquire when the packet was to sail. The gentleman then\r\nsaid, that he was collector of the customs, and had an information\r\nagainst us, and must examine our baggage for prohibited articles. He\r\nproduced his commission as Collector. Mr. Frost demanded to see the\r\ninformation, which the Collector refused to shew, and continued to\r\nrefuse, on every demand that we made. The Collector then called in\r\nseveral other officers, and began first to search our pockets. He took\r\nfrom Mr. Audibert, who was then returned into the room, every thing\r\nhe found in his pocket, and laid it on the table. He then searched Mr.\r\nFrost in the same manner, (who, among other things, had the keys of the\r\ntrunks in his pocket,) and then did the same by me. Mr. Frost wanting\r\nto go out, mentioned it, and was going towards the door; on which the\r\nCollector placed himself against the door, and said, nobody should\r\ndepart the room. After the keys had been taken from Mr. Frost, (for I\r\nhad given him the keys of my trunks beforehand, for the purpose of his\r\nattending the baggage to the customs, if it should be necessary,) the\r\nCollector asked us to open the trunks, presenting us the keys for\r\nthat purpose; this we declined to do, unless he would produce his\r\ninformation, which he again refused. The Collector then opened the\r\ntrunks himself, and took out every paper and letter, sealed or unsealed.\r\nOn our remonstrating with him on the bad policy, as well as the\r\nillegality, of Custom-House officers seizing papers and letters, which\r\nwere things that did not come under their cognizance, he replied, that\r\nthe _Proclamation_ gave him the authority.\r\n\r\nAmong the letters which he took out of my trunk, were two sealed\r\nletters, given into my charge by the American Minister in London\r\n[Pinckney], one of which was directed to the American Minister at Paris\r\n[Gouverneur Morris], the other to a private gentleman; a letter from the\r\nPresident of the United States, and a letter from the Secretary of\r\nState in America, both directed to me, and which I had received from\r\nthe American Minister, now in London, and were private letters of\r\nfriendship; a letter from the electoral body of the Department of\r\nCalais, containing the notification of my being elected to the National\r\nConvention; and a letter from the President of the National Assembly,\r\ninforming me of my being also elected for the Department of the Oise.\r\n\r\nAs we found that all remonstrances with the Collector, on the bad policy\r\nand illegality of seizing papers and letters, and retaining our persons\r\nby force, under the pretence of searching for prohibited articles,\r\nwere vain, (for he justified himself on the Proclamation, and on the\r\ninformation which he refused to shew,) we contented ourselves with\r\nassuring him, that what he was then doing, he would afterwards have to\r\nanswer for, and left it to himself to do as he pleased.\r\n\r\nIt appeared to us that the Collector was acting under the direction of\r\nsome other person or persons, then in the hotel, but whom he did not\r\nchoose we should see, or who did not choose to be seen by us; for the\r\nCollector went several times out of the room for a few minutes, and was\r\nalso called out several times.\r\n\r\nWhen the Collector had taken what papers and letters he pleased out of\r\nthe trunks, he proceeded to read them. The first letter he took up for\r\nthis purpose was that from the President of the United States to me.\r\nWhile he was doing this, I said, that it was very extraordinary that\r\nGeneral Washington could not write a letter of private friendship to\r\nme, without its being subject to be read by a custom-house officer. Upon\r\nthis Mr. Frost laid his hand over the face of the letter, and told the\r\nCollector that he should not read it, and took it from him. Mr. Frost\r\nthen, casting his eyes on the concluding paragraph of the letter, said,\r\nI will read this part to you, which he did; of which the following is an\r\nexact transcript--\r\n\r\n\"And as no one can feel a greater interest in the happiness of mankind\r\nthan I do, it is the first wish of my heart, that the enlightened policy\r\nof the present age may diffuse to all men those blessings to which\r\nthey are entitled, and lay the foundation of happiness for future\r\ngenerations.\"(1)\r\n\r\nAs all the other letters and papers lay then on the table, the Collector\r\ntook them up, and was going out of the room with them. During the\r\ntransactions already stated, I contented myself with observing what\r\npassed, and spoke but little; but on seeing the Collector going out of\r\nthe room with the letters, I told him that the papers and letters then\r\nin his hand were either belonging to me, or entrusted to my charge, and\r\nthat as I could not permit them to be out of my sight, I must insist on\r\ngoing with him.\r\n\r\n     1 Washington's letter is dated 6 May, 1792. See my _Life of\r\n     Paine_ vol. i., p. 302.--_Editor_.\r\n\r\nThe Collector then made a list of the letters and papers, and went out\r\nof the room, giving the letters and papers into the charge of one of\r\nthe officers. He returned in a short time, and, after some trifling\r\nconversation, chiefly about the Proclamation, told us, that he saw _the\r\nProclamation was ill-founded_, and asked if we chose to put the letters\r\nand papers into the trunks ourselves, which, as we had not taken them\r\nout, we declined doing, and he did it himself, and returned us the keys.\r\n\r\nIn stating to you these matters, I make no complaint against the\r\npersonal conduct of the Collector, or of any of the officers. Their\r\nmanner was as civil as such an extraordinary piece of business could\r\nadmit of.\r\n\r\nMy chief motive in writing to you on this subject is, that you may take\r\nmeasures for preventing the like in future, not only as it concerns\r\nprivate individuals, but in order to prevent a renewal of those\r\nunpleasant consequences that have heretofore arisen between nations from\r\ncircumstances equally as insignificant. I mention this only for myself;\r\nbut as the interruption extended to two other gentlemen, it is probable\r\nthat they, as individuals, will take some more effectual mode for\r\nredress.\r\n\r\nI am, Sir, yours, &c.\r\n\r\nThomas Paine.\r\n\r\nP. S. Among the papers seized, was a copy of the Attorney-General's\r\ninformation against me for publishing the _Rights of Man_, and a printed\r\nproof copy of my Letter to the Addressers, which will soon be published.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX. LETTER ADDRESSED TO THE ADDRESSERS ON THE LATE PROCLAMATION.(1)\r\n\r\nCOULD I have commanded circumstances with a wish, I know not of any that\r\nwould have more generally promoted the progress of knowledge, than\r\nthe late Proclamation, and the numerous rotten Borough and Corporation\r\nAddresses thereon. They have not only served as advertisements, but they\r\nhave excited a spirit of enquiry into principles of government, and a\r\ndesire to read the Rights OF Man, in places where that spirit and that\r\nwork were before unknown.\r\n\r\nThe people of England, wearied and stunned with parties, and alternately\r\ndeceived by each, had almost resigned the prerogative of thinking. Even\r\ncuriosity had expired, and a universal languor had spread itself over\r\nthe land. The opposition was visibly no other than a contest for power,\r\nwhilst the mass of the nation stood torpidly by as the prize.\r\n\r\nIn this hopeless state of things, the First Part of the Rights of\r\nMan made its appearance. It had to combat with a strange mixture\r\nof prejudice and indifference; it stood exposed to every species of\r\nnewspaper abuse; and besides this, it had to remove the obstructions\r\nwhich Mr. Burke's rude and outrageous attack on the French Revolution\r\nhad artfully raised.\r\n\r\n     1 The Royal Proclamation issued against seditious writings,\r\n     May 21st. This pamphlet, the proof of which was read in\r\n     Paris (see P. S. of preceding chapter), was published at 1s.\r\n     6d. by H. D. Symonds, Paternoster Row, and Thomas Clio\r\n     Rickman, 7 Upper Marylebone Street (where it was written),\r\n     both pub-Ushers being soon after prosecuted.--_Editor_.\r\n\r\nBut how easy does even the most illiterate reader distinguish the\r\nspontaneous sensations of the heart, from the laboured productions of\r\nthe brain. Truth, whenever it can fully appear, is a thing so naturally\r\nfamiliar to the mind, that an acquaintance commences at first sight.\r\nNo artificial light, yet discovered, can display all the properties of\r\ndaylight; so neither can the best invented fiction fill the mind with\r\nevery conviction which truth begets.\r\n\r\nTo overthrow Mr. Burke's fallacious book was scarcely the operation of a\r\nday. Even the phalanx of Placemen and Pensioners, who had given the\r\ntone to the multitude, by clamouring forth his political fame, became\r\nsuddenly silent; and the final event to himself has been, that as he\r\nrose like a rocket, he fell like the stick.\r\n\r\nIt seldom happens, that the mind rests satisfied with the simple\r\ndetection of error or imposition. Once put in motion, _that_ motion soon\r\nbecomes accelerated; where it had intended to stop, it discovers new\r\nreasons to proceed, and renews and continues the pursuit far beyond the\r\nlimits it first prescribed to itself. Thus it has happened to the people\r\nof England. From a detection of Mr. Burke's incoherent rhapsodies, and\r\ndistorted facts, they began an enquiry into the first principles of\r\nGovernment, whilst himself, like an object left far behind, became\r\ninvisible and forgotten.\r\n\r\nMuch as the First Part of RIGHTS OF Man impressed at its first\r\nappearance, the progressive mind soon discovered that it did not go far\r\nenough. It detected errors; it exposed absurdities; it shook the fabric\r\nof political superstition; it generated new ideas; but it did not\r\nproduce a regular system of principles in the room of those which it\r\ndisplaced. And, if I may guess at the mind of the Government-party,\r\nthey beheld it as an unexpected gale that would soon blow over, and\r\nthey forbore, like sailors in threatening weather, to whistle, lest they\r\nshould encrease(sic) the wind. Every thing, on their part, was profound\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\nWhen the Second Part of _Rights of Man, combining Principle and\r\nPractice_, was preparing to appear, they affected, for a while, to act\r\nwith the same policy as before; but finding their silence had no more\r\ninfluence in stifling the progress of the work, than it would have in\r\nstopping the progress of time, they changed their plan, and affected\r\nto treat it with clamorous contempt. The Speech-making Placemen and\r\nPensioners, and Place-expectants, in both Houses of Parliament, the\r\n_Outs_ as well as the _Ins_, represented it as a silly, insignificant\r\nperformance; as a work incapable of producing any effect; as something\r\nwhich they were sure the good sense of the people would either despise\r\nor indignantly spurn; but such was the overstrained awkwardness with\r\nwhich they harangued and encouraged each other, that in the very act of\r\ndeclaring their confidence they betrayed their fears.\r\n\r\nAs most of the rotten Borough Addressers are obscured in holes and\r\ncorners throughout the country, and to whom a newspaper arrives as\r\nrarely as an almanac, they most probably have not had the opportunity of\r\nknowing how far this part of the farce (the original prelude to all the\r\nAddresses) has been acted. For _their_ information, I will suspend a\r\nwhile the more serious purpose of my Letter, and entertain them with two\r\nor three Speeches in the last Session of Parliament, which will serve\r\nthem for politics till Parliament meets again.\r\n\r\nYou must know, Gentlemen, that the Second Part of the Rights of Man (the\r\nbook against which you have been presenting Addresses, though it is\r\nmost probable that many of you did not know it) was to have come out\r\nprecisely at the time that Parliament last met. It happened not to be\r\npublished till a few days after. But as it was very well known that the\r\nbook would shortly appear, the parliamentary Orators entered into a very\r\ncordial coalition to cry the book down, and they began their attack by\r\ncrying up the _blessings_ of the Constitution.\r\n\r\nHad it been your fate to have been there, you could not but have been\r\nmoved at the heart-and-pocket-felt congratulations that passed between\r\nall the parties on this subject of _blessings_; for the _Outs_ enjoy\r\nplaces and pensions and sinecures as well as the _Ins_, and are as\r\ndevoutly attached to the firm of the house.\r\n\r\nOne of the most conspicuous of this motley groupe, is the Clerk of\r\nthe Court of King's Bench, who calls himself Lord Stormont. He is also\r\ncalled Justice General of Scotland, and Keeper of Scoon, (an opposition\r\nman,) and he draws from the public for these nominal offices, not less,\r\nas I am informed, than six thousand pounds a-year, and he is, most\r\nprobably, at the trouble of counting the money, and signing a receipt,\r\nto shew, perhaps, that he is qualified to be Clerk as well as Justice.\r\nHe spoke as follows.(*)\r\n\r\n\"That we shall all be unanimous in expressing our attachment to the\r\nconstitution of these realms, I am confident. It is a subject upon which\r\nthere can be no divided opinion in this house. I do not pretend to be\r\ndeep read in the knowledge of the Constitution, but I take upon me to\r\nsay, that from the extent of my knowledge [_for I have so many thousands\r\na year for nothing_] it appears to me, that from the period of the\r\nRevolution, for it was by no means created then, it has been, both in\r\ntheory and practice, the wisest system that ever was formed. I never was\r\n[he means he never was till now] a dealer in political cant. My life has\r\nnot been occupied in that way, but the speculations of late years seem\r\nto have taken a turn, for which I cannot account. When I came into\r\npublic life, the political pamphlets of the time, however they might be\r\ncharged with the heat and violence of parties, were agreed in extolling\r\nthe radical beauties of the Constitution itself. I remember [_he means\r\nhe has forgotten_] a most captivating eulogium on its charms, by Lord\r\nBolingbroke, where he recommends his readers to contemplate it in all\r\nits aspects, with the assurance that it would be found more estimable\r\nthe more it was seen, I do not recollect his precise words, but I wish\r\nthat men who write upon these subjects would take this for their\r\nmodel, instead of the political pamphlets, which, I am told, are now in\r\ncirculation, [_such, I suppose, as Rights of Man,_] pamphlets which\r\nI have not read, and whose purport I know only by report, [_he means,\r\nperhaps, by the noise they make_.] This, however, I am sure, that\r\npamphlets tending to unsettle the public reverence for the constitution,\r\nwill have very little influence. They can do very little harm--for\r\n[_by the bye, he is no dealer in political cant_] the English are a\r\nsober-thinking people, and are more intelligent, more solid, more steady\r\nin their opinions, than any people I ever had the fortune to see. [_This\r\nis pretty well laid on, though, for a new beginner_.] But if there\r\nshould ever come a time when the propagation of those doctrines should\r\nagitate the public mind, I am sure for every one of your Lordships, that\r\nno attack will be made on the constitution, from which it is truly said\r\nthat we derive all our prosperity, without raising every one of\r\nyour Lordships to its support It will then be found that there is no\r\ndifference among us, but that we are all determined to stand or fall\r\ntogether, in defence of the inestimable system \"--[_of places and\r\npensions_].\r\n\r\n     * See his speech in the Morning Chronicle of Feb. 1.--\r\n     Author.\r\n\r\nAfter Stormont, on the opposition side, sat down, up rose another noble\r\nLord, on the ministerial side, Grenville. This man ought to be as strong\r\nin the back as a mule, or the sire of a mule, or it would crack with\r\nthe weight of places and offices. He rose, however, without feeling any\r\nincumbrance, full master of his weight; and thus said this noble Lord to\r\nt'other noble Lord!\r\n\r\n\"The patriotic and manly manner in which the noble Lord has declared\r\nhis sentiments on the subject of the constitution, demands my cordial\r\napprobation. The noble Viscount has proved, that however we may differ\r\non particular measures, amidst all the jars and dissonance of parties,\r\nwe are unanimous in principle. There is a perfect and entire consent\r\n[_between us_] in the love and maintenance of the constitution as\r\nhappily subsisting. It must undoubtedly give your Lordships concern, to\r\nfind that the time is come [heigh ho!] when there is propriety in the\r\nexpressions of regard to [o! o! o!] the constitution. And that there are\r\nmen [confound--their--po-li-tics] who disseminate doctrines hostile to\r\nthe genuine spirit of our well balanced system, [_it is certainly well\r\nbalanced when both sides hold places and pensions at once._] I agree\r\nwith the noble viscount that they have not [I hope] much success. I am\r\nconvinced that there is no danger to be apprehended from their attempts:\r\nbut it is truly important and consolatory [to us placemen, I suppose] to\r\nknow, that if ever there should arise a serious alarm, there is but one\r\nspirit, one sense, [_and that sense I presume is not common sense_]\r\nand one determination in this house \"--which undoubtedly is to hold all\r\ntheir places and pensions as long as they can.\r\n\r\nBoth those speeches (except the parts enclosed in parenthesis, which\r\nare added for the purpose of illustration) are copied verbatim from the\r\nMorning Chronicle of the 1st of February last; and when the situation of\r\nthe speakers is considered, the one in the opposition, and the other\r\nin the ministry, and both of them living at the public expence, by\r\nsinecure, or nominal places and offices, it required a very unblushing\r\nfront to be able to deliver them. Can those men seriously suppose\r\nany nation to be so completely blind as not to see through them? Can\r\nStormont imagine that the political _cant_, with which he has larded his\r\nharangue, will conceal the craft? Does he not know that there never was\r\na cover large enough to hide _itself_? Or can Grenvilie believe that his\r\ncredit with the public encreases with his avarice for places?\r\n\r\nBut, if these orators will accept a service from me, in return for the\r\nallusions they have made to the _Rights of Man_, I will make a speech\r\nfor either of them to deliver, on the excellence of the constitution,\r\nthat shall be as much to the purpose as what they have spoken, or as\r\n_Bolingbroke's captivating eulogium_. Here it is.\r\n\r\n\"That we shall all be unanimous in expressing our attachment to the\r\nconstitution, I am confident. It is, my Lords, incomprehensibly good:\r\nbut the great wonder of all is the wisdom; for it is, my lords, _the\r\nwisest system that ever was formed_.\r\n\r\n\"With respect to us, noble Lords, though the world does not know it, it\r\nis very well known to us, that we have more wisdom than we know what to\r\ndo with; and what is still better, my Lords, we have it all in stock. I\r\ndefy your Lordships to prove, that a tittle of it has been used yet; and\r\nif we but go on, my Lords, with the frugality we have hitherto done, we\r\nshall leave to our heirs and successors, when we go out of the world,\r\nthe whole stock of wisdom, _untouched_, that we brought in; and there is\r\nno doubt but they will follow our example. This, my lords, is one of the\r\nblessed effects of the hereditary system; for we can never be without\r\nwisdom so long as we keep it by us, and do not use it.\r\n\r\n\"But, my Lords, as all this wisdom is hereditary property, for the sole\r\nbenefit of us and our heirs, and it is necessary that the people should\r\nknow where to get a supply for their own use, the excellence of our\r\nconstitution has provided us a King for this very purpose, and for _no\r\nother_. But, my Lords, I perceive a defect to which the constitution\r\nis subject, and which I propose to remedy by bringing a bill into\r\nParliament for that purpose.\r\n\r\n\"The constitution, my Lords, out of delicacy, I presume, has left it as\r\na matter of _choice_ to a King whether he will be wise or not. It has\r\nnot, I mean, my Lords, insisted upon it as a constitutional point,\r\nwhich, I conceive it ought to have done; for I pledge myself to your\r\nLordships to prove, and that with _true patriotic boldness_, that he has\r\n_no choice in the matter_. This bill, my Lords, which I shall bring in,\r\nwill be to declare, that the constitution, according to the true intent\r\nand meaning thereof, does not invest the King with this choice; our\r\nancestors were too wise to do that; and, in order to prevent any doubts\r\nthat might otherwise arise, I shall prepare, my Lords, an enacting\r\nclause, to fix the wisdom of Kings by act of Parliament; and then, my\r\nLords our Constitution will be the wonder of the world!\r\n\r\n\"Wisdom, my lords, is the one thing needful: but that there may be no\r\nmistake in this matter, and that we may proceed consistently with the\r\ntrue wisdom of the constitution, I shall propose a _certain criterion_\r\nwhereby the _exact quantity of wisdom_ necessary for a King may be\r\nknown. [Here should be a cry of, Hear him! Hear him!]\r\n\r\n\"It is recorded, my Lords, in the Statutes at Large of the Jews, 'a\r\nbook, my Lords, which I have not read, and whose purport I know only by\r\nreport,' _but perhaps the bench of Bishops can recollect something about\r\nit_, that Saul gave the most convincing proofs of royal wisdom before\r\nhe was made a King, _for he was sent to seek his father's asses and he\r\ncould not find them_.\r\n\r\n\"Here, my Lords, we have, most happily for us, a case in point: This\r\nprecedent ought to be established by act of Parliament; and every King,\r\nbefore he be crowned, should be sent to seek his father's asses, and\r\nif he cannot find them, he shall be declared wise enough to be King,\r\naccording to the true meaning of our excellent constitution. All,\r\ntherefore, my Lords, that will be necessary to be done by the enacting\r\nclause that I shall bring in, will be to invest the King beforehand with\r\nthe quantity of wisdom necessary for this purpose, lest he should happen\r\nnot to possess it; and this, my Lords, we can do without making use of\r\nany of our own.\r\n\r\n\"We further read, my Lords, in the said Statutes at Large of the\r\nJews, that Samuel, who certainly was as mad as any Man-of-Rights-Man\r\nnow-a-days (hear him! hear him!), was highly displeased, and even\r\nexasperated, at the proposal of the Jews to have a King, and he warned\r\nthem against it with all that assurance and impudence of which he was\r\nmaster. I have been, my Lords, at the trouble of going all the way to\r\n_Paternoster-row_, to procure an extract from the printed copy. I was\r\ntold that I should meet with it there, or in _Amen-eorner_, for I was\r\nthen going, my Lords, to rummage for it among the curiosities of the\r\n_Antiquarian Society_. I will read the extracts to your Lordships, to\r\nshew how little Samuel knew of the matter.\r\n\r\n\"The extract, my Lords, is from 1 Sam. chap. viii.:\r\n\r\n\"'And Samuel told all the words of the Lord unto the people that asked\r\nof him a King.\r\n\r\n\"'And he said, this will be the manner of the King that shall reign\r\nover you: he will take your sons, and appoint them for himself, for\r\nhis chariots, and to be his horsemen; and some shall run before his\r\nchariots.\r\n\r\n\"'And he will appoint him captains over thousands, and captains over\r\nfifties, and will set them to ear his ground, and to reap his harvest,\r\nand to make his instruments of war, and instruments of his chariots.\r\n\r\n\"'And he will take your daughters to be confectionnes, and to be cooks,\r\nand to be bakers.\r\n\r\n\"'And he will take your fields, and your vineyards, and your\r\nolive-yards, even the best of them, and give them to his servants.\r\n\r\n\"'And he will take the tenth of your seed, and of your vineyards, and\r\ngive to his officers and to his servants.\r\n\r\n\"'And he will take your men-servants, and your maid-servants, and your\r\ngoodliest young men, and your asses, and put them to his work.\r\n\r\n\"'And he will take the tenth of your sheep, and ye shall be his\r\nservants.\r\n\r\n\"'And ye shall cry out in that day, because of your King, which ye shall\r\nhave chosen you; and the Lord will not hear you in that day.'\r\n\r\n\"Now, my Lords, what can we think of this man Samuel? Is there a word of\r\ntruth, or any thing like truth, in all that he has said? He pretended\r\nto be a prophet, or a wise man, but has not the event proved him to be a\r\nfool, or an incendiary? Look around, my Lords, and see if any thing has\r\nhappened that he pretended to foretell! Has not the most profound peace\r\nreigned throughout the world ever since Kings were in fashion? Are not,\r\nfor example, the present Kings of Europe the most peaceable of mankind,\r\nand the Empress of Russia the very milk of human kindness? It would not\r\nbe worth having Kings, my Lords, if it were not that they never go to\r\nwar.\r\n\r\n\"If we look at home, my Lords, do we not see the same things here as are\r\nseen every where else? Are our young men taken to be horsemen, or foot\r\nsoldiers, any more than in Germany or in Prussia, or in Hanover or in\r\nHesse? Are not our sailors as safe at land as at sea? Are they ever\r\ndragged from their homes, like oxen to the slaughter-house, to serve on\r\nboard ships of war? When they return from the perils of a long voyage\r\nwith the merchandize of distant countries, does not every man sit down\r\nunder his own vine and his own fig-tree, in perfect security? Is the\r\ntenth of our seed taken by tax-gatherers, or is any part of it given to\r\nthe King's servants? In short, _is not everything as free from taxes as\r\nthe light from Heaven!_ (1)\r\n\r\n\"Ah! my Lords, do we not see the blessed effect of having Kings in every\r\nthing we look at? Is not the G. R., or the broad R., stampt upon every\r\nthing? Even the shoes, the gloves, and the hats that we wear,\r\nare enriched with the impression, and all our candles blaze a\r\nburnt-offering.\r\n\r\n\"Besides these blessings, my Lords, that cover us from the sole of the\r\nfoot to the crown of the head, do we not see a race of youths growing\r\nup to be Kings, who are the very paragons of virtue? There is not one of\r\nthem, my Lords, but might be trusted with untold gold, as safely as\r\nthe other. Are they not '_more sober, intelligent, more solid, more\r\nsteady_,' and withal, _more learned, more wise, more every thing, than\r\nany youths we '_ever had the fortune to see.' Ah! my Lords, they are a\r\n_hopeful family_.\r\n\r\n\"The blessed prospect of succession, which the nation has at this moment\r\nbefore its eyes, is a most undeniable proof of the excellence of our\r\nconstitution, and of the blessed hereditary system; for nothing, my\r\nLords, but a constitution founded on the truest and purest wisdom\r\ncould admit such heaven-born and heaven-taught characters into the\r\ngovernment.--Permit me now, my Lords, to recal your attention to the\r\nlibellous chapter I have just read about Kings. I mention this, my\r\nLords, because it is my intention to move for a bill to be brought into\r\nparliament to expunge that chapter from the Bible, and that the Lord\r\nChancellor, with the assistance of the Prince of Wales, the Duke of\r\nYork, and the Duke of Clarence, be requested to write a chapter in the\r\nroom of it; and that Mr. Burke do see that it be truly canonical, and\r\nfaithfully inserted.\"--Finis.\r\n\r\n     1 Allusion to the window-tax.--Editor,\r\n\r\nIf the Clerk of the Court of King's Bench should chuse to be the orator\r\nof this luminous encomium on the constitution, I hope he will get\r\nit well by heart before he attempts to deliver it, and not have\r\nto apologize to Parliament, as he did in the case of Bolingbroke's\r\nencomium, for forgetting his lesson; and, with this admonition I leave\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nHaving thus informed the Addressers of what passed at the meeting of\r\nParliament, I return to take up the subject at the part where I broke\r\noff in order to introduce the preceding speeches.\r\n\r\nI was then stating, that the first policy of the Government party was\r\nsilence, and the next, clamorous contempt; but as people generally\r\nchoose to read and judge for themselves, the work still went on, and the\r\naffectation of contempt, like the silence that preceded it, passed for\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\nThus foiled in their second scheme, their evil genius, like a\r\nwill-with-a-wisp, led them to a third; when all at once, as if it had\r\nbeen unfolded to them by a fortune-teller, or Mr. Dundas had discovered\r\nit by second sight, this once harmless, insignificant book, without\r\nundergoing the alteration of a single letter, became a most wicked and\r\ndangerous Libel. The whole Cabinet, like a ship's crew, became alarmed;\r\nall hands were piped upon deck, as if a conspiracy of elements was\r\nforming around them, and out came the Proclamation and the Prosecution;\r\nand Addresses supplied the place of prayers.\r\n\r\nYe silly swains, thought I to myself, why do you torment yourselves\r\nthus? The Rights OF Man is a book calmly and rationally written; why\r\nthen are you so disturbed? Did you see how little or how suspicious such\r\nconduct makes you appear, even cunning alone, had you no other faculty,\r\nwould hush you into prudence. The plans, principles, and arguments,\r\ncontained in that work, are placed before the eyes of the nation, and\r\nof the world, in a fair, open, and manly manner, and nothing more is\r\nnecessary than to refute them. Do this, and the whole is done; but if ye\r\ncannot, so neither can ye suppress the reading, nor convict the author;\r\nfor the Law, in the opinion of all good men, would convict itself, that\r\nshould condemn what cannot be refuted.\r\n\r\nHaving now shown the Addressers the several stages of the business,\r\nprior to their being called upon, like Cæsar in the Tyber, crying to\r\nCassius, \"_help, Cassius, or I sink_!\" I next come to remark on the\r\npolicy of the Government, in promoting Addresses; on the consequences\r\nnaturally resulting therefrom; and on the conduct of the persons\r\nconcerned.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the policy, it evidently carries with it every mark\r\nand feature of disguised fear. And it will hereafter be placed in the\r\nhistory of extraordinary things, that a pamphlet should be produced by\r\nan individual, unconnected with any sect or party, and not seeking to\r\nmake any, and almost a stranger in the land, that should compleatly\r\nfrighten a whole Government, and that in the midst of its most\r\ntriumphant security. Such a circumstance cannot fail to prove, that\r\neither the pamphlet has irresistible powers, or the Government very\r\nextraordinary defects, or both. The nation exhibits no signs of fear at\r\nthe Rights of Man; why then should the Government, unless the interest\r\nof the two are really opposite to each other, and the secret is\r\nbeginning to be known? That there are two distinct classes of men in\r\nthe nation, those who pay taxes, and those who receive and live upon\r\nthe taxes, is evident at first sight; and when taxation is carried to\r\nexcess, it cannot fail to disunite those two, and something of this kind\r\nis now beginning to appear.\r\n\r\nIt is also curious to observe, amidst all the fume and bustle about\r\nProclamations and Addresses, kept up by a few noisy and interested men,\r\nhow little the mass of the nation seem to care about either. They\r\nappear to me, by the indifference they shew, not to believe a word the\r\nProclamation contains; and as to the Addresses, they travel to London\r\nwith the silence of a funeral, and having announced their arrival in\r\nthe Gazette, are deposited with the ashes of their predecessors, and Mr.\r\nDundas writes their _hic facet_.\r\n\r\nOne of the best effects which the Proclamation, and its echo the\r\nAddresses have had, has been that of exciting and spreading curiosity;\r\nand it requires only a single reflection to discover, that the object\r\nof all curiosity is knowledge. When the mass of the nation saw that\r\nPlacemen, Pensioners, and Borough-mongers, were the persons that stood\r\nforward to promote Addresses, it could not fail to create suspicions\r\nthat the public good was not their object; that the character of the\r\nbooks, or writings, to which such persons obscurely alluded, not daring\r\nto mention them, was directly contrary to what they described them to\r\nbe, and that it was necessary that every man, for his own satisfaction,\r\nshould exercise his proper right, and read and judge for himself.\r\n\r\nBut how will the persons who have been induced to read the _Rights of\r\nMan_, by the clamour that has been raised against it, be surprized\r\nto find, that, instead of a wicked, inflammatory work, instead of a\r\nlicencious and profligate performance, it abounds with principles of\r\ngovernment that are uncontrovertible--with arguments which every reader\r\nwill feel, are unanswerable--with plans for the increase of commerce\r\nand manufactures--for the extinction of war--for the education of\r\nthe children of the poor--for the comfortable support of the aged and\r\ndecayed persons of both sexes--for the relief of the army and navy, and,\r\nin short, for the promotion of every thing that can benefit the moral,\r\ncivil, and political condition of Man.\r\n\r\nWhy, then, some calm observer will ask, why is the work prosecuted, if\r\nthese be the goodly matters it contains? I will tell thee, friend;\r\nit contains also a plan for the reduction of Taxes, for lessening the\r\nimmense expences of Government, for abolishing sinecure Places and\r\nPensions; and it proposes applying the redundant taxes, that shall\r\nbe saved by these reforms, to the purposes mentioned in the former\r\nparagraph, instead of applying them to the support of idle and\r\nprofligate Placemen and Pensioners.\r\n\r\nIs it, then, any wonder that Placemen and Pensioners, and the whole\r\ntrain of Court expectants, should become the promoters of Addresses,\r\nProclamations, and Prosecutions? or, is it any wonder that Corporations\r\nand rotten Boroughs, which are attacked and exposed, both in the First\r\nand Second Parts of _Rights of Man_, as unjust monopolies and public\r\nnuisances, should join in the cavalcade? Yet these are the sources from\r\nwhich Addresses have sprung. Had not such persons come forward to\r\noppose the _Rights of Man_, I should have doubted the efficacy of my\r\nown writings: but those opposers have now proved to me that the blow was\r\nwell directed, and they have done it justice by confessing the smart.\r\n\r\nThe principal deception in this business of Addresses has been, that the\r\npromoters of them have not come forward in their proper characters. They\r\nhave assumed to pass themselves upon the public as a part of the Public,\r\nbearing a share of the burthen of Taxes, and acting for the public good;\r\nwhereas, they are in general that part of it that adds to the public\r\nburthen, by living on the produce of the public taxes. They are to the\r\npublic what the locusts are to the tree: the burthen would be less, and\r\nthe prosperity would be greater, if they were shaken off.\r\n\r\n\"I do not come here,\" said Onslow, at the Surry County meeting, \"as the\r\nLord Lieutenant and Custos Rotulorum of the county, but I come here as\r\na plain country gentleman.\" The fact is, that he came there as what he\r\nwas, and as no other, and consequently he came as one of the beings I\r\nhave been describing. If it be the character of a gentleman to be fed by\r\nthe public, as a pauper is by the parish, Onslow has a fair claim to the\r\ntitle; and the same description will suit the Duke of Richmond, who led\r\nthe Address at the Sussex meeting. He also may set up for a gentleman.\r\n\r\nAs to the meeting in the next adjoining county (Kent), it was a scene of\r\ndisgrace. About two hundred persons met, when a small part of them drew\r\nprivately away from the rest, and voted an Address: the consequence of\r\nwhich was that they got together by the ears, and produced a riot in the\r\nvery act of producing an Address to prevent Riots.\r\n\r\nThat the Proclamation and the Addresses have failed of their intended\r\neffect, may be collected from the silence which the Government party\r\nitself observes. The number of addresses has been weekly retailed in the\r\nGazette; but the number of Addressers has been concealed. Several of the\r\nAddresses have been voted by not more than ten or twelve persons; and a\r\nconsiderable number of them by not more than thirty. The whole number of\r\nAddresses presented at the time of writing this letter is three hundred\r\nand twenty, (rotten Boroughs and Corporations included) and even\r\nadmitting, on an average, one hundred Addressers to each address, the\r\nwhole number of addressers would be but thirty-two thousand, and nearly\r\nthree months have been taken up in procuring this number. That the\r\nsuccess of the Proclamation has been less than the success of the work\r\nit was intended to discourage, is a matter within my own knowledge; for\r\na greater number of the cheap edition of the First and Second Parts of\r\nthe Rights OF Man has been sold in the space only of one month, than the\r\nwhole number of Addressers (admitting them to be thirty-two thousand)\r\nhave amounted to in three months.\r\n\r\nIt is a dangerous attempt in any government to say to a Nation, \"_thou\r\nshalt not read_.\" This is now done in Spain, and was formerly done under\r\nthe old Government of France; but it served to procure the downfall of\r\nthe latter, and is subverting that of the former; and it will have\r\nthe same tendency in all countries; because _thought_ by some means\r\nor other, is got abroad in the world, and cannot be restrained, though\r\nreading may.\r\n\r\nIf _Rights of Man_ were a book that deserved the vile description which\r\nthe promoters of the Address have given of it, why did not these men\r\nprove their charge, and satisfy the people, by producing it, and reading\r\nit publicly? This most certainly ought to have been done, and would also\r\nhave been done, had they believed it would have answered their purpose.\r\nBut the fact is, that the book contains truths which those time-servers\r\ndreaded to hear, and dreaded that the people should know; and it is now\r\nfollowing up the,\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESS TO ADDRESSERS.\r\n\r\nAddresses in every part of the nation, and convicting them of\r\nfalsehoods.\r\n\r\nAmong the unwarrantable proceedings to which the Proclamation has given\r\nrise, the meetings of the Justices in several of the towns and counties\r\nought to be noticed.. Those men have assumed to re-act the farce of\r\nGeneral Warrants, and to suppress, by their own authority, whatever\r\npublications they please. This is an attempt at power equalled only by\r\nthe conduct of the minor despots of the most despotic governments in\r\nEurope, and yet those Justices affect to call England a Free Country.\r\nBut even this, perhaps, like the scheme for garrisoning the country\r\nby building military barracks, is necessary to awaken the country to a\r\nsense of its Rights, and, as such, it will have a good effect.\r\n\r\nAnother part of the conduct of such Justices has been, that of\r\nthreatening to take away the licences from taverns and public-houses,\r\nwhere the inhabitants of the neighbourhood associated to read and\r\ndiscuss the principles of Government, and to inform each other thereon.\r\nThis, again, is similar to what is doing in Spain and Russia; and the\r\nreflection which it cannot fail to suggest is, that the principles and\r\nconduct of any Government must be bad, when that Government dreads and\r\nstartles at discussion, and seeks security by a prevention of knowledge.\r\n\r\nIf the Government, or the Constitution, or by whatever name it be\r\ncalled, be that miracle of perfection which the Proclamation and\r\nthe Addresses have trumpeted it forth to be, it ought to have defied\r\ndiscussion and investigation, instead of dreading it. Whereas, every\r\nattempt it makes, either by Proclamation, Prosecution, or Address, to\r\nsuppress investigation, is a confession that it feels itself unable to\r\nbear it. It is error only, and not truth, that shrinks from enquiry. All\r\nthe numerous pamphlets, and all the newspaper falsehood and abuse, that\r\nhave been published against the Rights of Man, have fallen before it\r\nlike pointless arrows; and, in like manner, would any work have fallen\r\nbefore the Constitution, had the Constitution, as it is called, been\r\nfounded on as good political principles as those on which the Rights OF\r\nMan is written.\r\n\r\nIt is a good Constitution for courtiers, placemen, pensioners,\r\nborough-holders, and the leaders of Parties, and these are the men that\r\nhave been the active leaders of Addresses; but it is a bad Constitution\r\nfor at least ninety-nine parts of the nation out of an hundred, and this\r\ntruth is every day making its way.\r\n\r\nIt is bad, first, because it entails upon the nation the unnecessary\r\nexpence of supporting three forms and systems of Government at once,\r\nnamely, the monarchical, the aristocratical, and the democratical.\r\n\r\nSecondly, because it is impossible to unite such a discordant\r\ncomposition by any other means than perpetual corruption; and therefore\r\nthe corruption so loudly and so universally complained of, is no\r\nother than the natural consequence of such an unnatural compound of\r\nGovernments; and in this consists that excellence which the numerous\r\nherd of placemen and pensioners so loudly extol, and which at the same\r\ntime, occasions that enormous load of taxes under which the rest of the\r\nnation groans.\r\n\r\nAmong the mass of national delusions calculated to amuse and impose upon\r\nthe multitude, the standing one has been that of flattering them into\r\ntaxes, by calling the Government (or as they please to express it,\r\nthe English Constitution) \"_the envy and the admiration of the world_\"\r\nScarcely an Address has been voted in which some of the speakers have\r\nnot uttered this hackneyed nonsensical falsehood.\r\n\r\nTwo Revolutions have taken place, those of America and France; and both\r\nof them have rejected the unnatural compounded system of the English\r\ngovernment. America has declared against all hereditary Government, and\r\nestablished the representative system of Government only. France has\r\nentirely rejected the aristocratical part, and is now discovering\r\nthe absurdity of the monarchical, and is approaching fast to the\r\nrepresentative system. On what ground then, do these men continue a\r\ndeclaration, respecting what they call the _envy and admiration of other\r\nnations_, which the voluntary practice of such nations, as have had the\r\nopportunity of establishing Government, contradicts and falsifies. Will\r\nsuch men never confine themselves to truth? Will they be for ever the\r\ndeceivers of the people?\r\n\r\nBut I will go further, and shew, that were Government now to begin in\r\nEngland, the people could not be brought to establish the same system\r\nthey now submit to.\r\n\r\nIn speaking on this subject (or on any other) _on the pure ground\r\nof principle_, antiquity and precedent cease to be authority, and\r\nhoary-headed error loses its effect. The reasonableness and propriety of\r\nthings must be examined abstractedly from custom and usage; and, in this\r\npoint of view, the right which grows into practice to-day is as much a\r\nright, and as old in principle and theory, as if it had the customary\r\nsanction of a thousand ages. Principles have no connection with time,\r\nnor characters with names.\r\n\r\nTo say that the Government of this country is composed of King, Lords,\r\nand Commons, is the mere phraseology of custom. It is composed of\r\nmen; and whoever the men be to whom the Government of any country is\r\nintrusted, they ought to be the best and wisest that can be found, and\r\nif they are not so, they are not fit for the station. A man derives\r\nno more excellence from the change of a name, or calling him King, or\r\ncalling him Lord, than I should do by changing my name from Thomas to\r\nGeorge, or from Paine to Guelph. I should not be a whit more able to\r\nwrite a book because my name was altered; neither would any man, now\r\ncalled a King or a lord, have a whit the more sense than he now has,\r\nwere he to call himself Thomas Paine.\r\n\r\nAs to the word \"Commons,\" applied as it is in England, it is a term\r\nof degradation and reproach, and ought to be abolished. It is a term\r\nunknown in free countries.\r\n\r\nBut to the point.--Let us suppose that Government was now to begin in\r\nEngland, and that the plan of Government, offered to the nation for its\r\napprobation or rejection, consisted of the following parts:\r\n\r\nFirst--That some one individual should be taken from all the rest of the\r\nnation, and to whom all the rest should swear obedience, and never be\r\npermitted to sit down in his presence, and that they should give to him\r\none million sterling a year.--That the nation should never after have\r\npower or authority to make laws but with his express consent; and that\r\nhis sons and his sons' sons, whether wise or foolish, good men or\r\nbad, fit or unfit, should have the same power, and also the same money\r\nannually paid to them for ever.\r\n\r\nSecondly--That there should be two houses of Legislators to assist in\r\nmaking laws, one of which should, in the first instance, be entirely\r\nappointed by the aforesaid person, and that their sons and their sons'\r\nsons, whether wise or foolish, good men or bad, fit or unfit, should for\r\never after be hereditary Legislators.\r\n\r\nThirdly--That the other house should be chosen in the same manner as the\r\nhouse now called the House of Commons is chosen, and should be subject\r\nto the controul of the two aforesaid hereditary Powers in all things.\r\n\r\nIt would be impossible to cram such a farrago of imposition and\r\nabsurdity down the throat of this or any other nation that was capable\r\nof reasoning upon its rights and its interest.\r\n\r\nThey would ask, in the first place, on what ground of right, or on what\r\nprinciple, such irrational and preposterous distinctions could, or ought\r\nto be made; and what pretensions any man could have, or what services he\r\ncould render, to entitle him to a million a year? They would go\r\nfarther, and revolt at the idea of consigning their children, and their\r\nchildren's children, to the domination of persons hereafter to be born,\r\nwho might, for any thing they could foresee, turn out to be knaves or\r\nfools; and they would finally discover, that the project of hereditary\r\nGovernors and Legislators _was a treasonable usurpation over the rights\r\nof posterity_. Not only the calm dictates of reason, and the force of\r\nnatural affection, but the integrity of manly pride, would impel men to\r\nspurn such proposals.\r\n\r\nFrom the grosser absurdities of such a scheme, they would extend their\r\nexamination to the practical defects--They would soon see that it would\r\nend in tyranny accomplished by fraud. That in the operation of it, it\r\nwould be two to one against them, because the two parts that were to be\r\nmade hereditary would form a common interest, and stick to each other;\r\nand that themselves and representatives would become no better\r\nthan hewers of wood and drawers of water for the other parts of the\r\nGovernment.--Yet call one of those powers King, the other Lords, and the\r\nthird the Commons, and it gives the model of what is called the English\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nI have asserted, and have shewn, both in the First and Second Parts\r\nof _Rights of Man_, that there is not such a thing as an English\r\nConstitution, and that the people have yet a Constitution to form. _A\r\nConstitution is a thing antecedent to a Government; it is the act of a\r\npeople creating a Government and giving it powers, and defining the\r\nlimits and exercise of the powers so given_. But whenever did the people\r\nof England, acting in their original constituent character, by a\r\ndelegation elected for that express purpose, declare and say, \"We, the\r\npeople of this land, do constitute and appoint this to be our system and\r\nform of Government.\" The Government has assumed to constitute itself,\r\nbut it never was constituted by the people, in whom alone the right of\r\nconstituting resides.\r\n\r\nI will here recite the preamble to the Federal Constitution of the\r\nUnited States of America. I have shewn in the Second Part of _Rights\r\nof Man_, the manner by which the Constitution was formed and afterwards\r\nratified; and to which I refer the reader. The preamble is in the\r\nfollowing words:\r\n\r\n\"We, the people, of the United States, in order to form a more perfect\r\nunion, establish justice, insure domestic tranquillity, provide for\r\ncommon defence, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings\r\nof liberty to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish this\r\nconstitution for the United States of America.\"\r\n\r\nThen follow the several articles which appoint the manner in which the\r\nseveral component parts of the Government, legislative and executive,\r\nshall be elected, and the period of their duration, and the powers they\r\nshall have: also, the manner by which future additions, alterations,\r\nor amendments, shall be made to the constitution. Consequently, every\r\nimprovement that can be made in the science of government, follows in\r\nthat country as a matter of order. It is only in Governments founded on\r\nassumption and false principles, that reasoning upon, and investigating\r\nsystems and principles of Government, and shewing their several\r\nexcellencies and defects, are termed libellous and seditious. These\r\nterms were made part of the charge brought against Locke, Hampden, and\r\nSydney, and will continue to be brought against all good men, so long as\r\nbad government shall continue.\r\n\r\nThe Government of this country has been ostentatiously giving challenges\r\nfor more than an hundred years past, upon what it called its own\r\nexcellence and perfection. Scarcely a King's Speech, or a Parliamentary\r\nSpeech, has been uttered, in which this glove has not been thrown, till\r\nthe world has been insulted with their challenges. But it now appears\r\nthat all this was vapour and vain boasting, or that it was intended to\r\nconceal abuses and defects, and hush the people into taxes. I have taken\r\nthe challenge up, and in behalf of the public have shewn, in a fair,\r\nopen, and candid manner, both the radical and practical defects of the\r\nsystem; when, lo! those champions of the Civil List have fled away,\r\nand sent the Attorney-General to deny the challenge, by turning the\r\nacceptance of it into an attack, and defending their Places and Pensions\r\nby a prosecution.\r\n\r\nI will here drop this part of the subject, and state a few particulars\r\nrespecting the prosecution now pending, by which the Addressers will\r\nsee that they have been used as tools to the prosecuting party and their\r\ndependents. The case is as follows:\r\n\r\nThe original edition of the First and Second Parts of the Rights of\r\nMan, having been expensively printed, (in the modern stile of printing\r\npamphlets, that they might be bound up with Mr. Burke's Reflections on\r\nthe French Revolution,) the high price(1) precluded the generality\r\nof people from purchasing; and many applications were made to me from\r\nvarious parts of the country to print the work in a cheaper manner. The\r\npeople of Sheffield requested leave to print two thousand copies for\r\nthemselves, with which request I immediately complied. The same request\r\ncame to me from Rotherham, from Leicester, from Chester, from several\r\ntowns in Scotland; and Mr. James Mackintosh, author of _Vindico\r\nGallico_, brought me a request from Warwickshire, for leave to print ten\r\nthousand copies in that county. I had already sent a cheap edition to\r\nScotland; and finding the applications increase, I concluded that the\r\nbest method of complying therewith, would be to print a very numerous\r\nedition in London, under my own direction, by which means the work would\r\nbe more perfect, and the price be reduced lower than it could be by\r\n_printing_ small editions in the country, of only a few thousands each.\r\n\r\n     1 Half  a crown.--_Editor_.\r\n\r\nThe cheap edition of the first part was begun about the first of last\r\nApril, and from that moment, and not before, I expected a prosecution,\r\nand the event has proved that I was not mistaken. I had then occasion to\r\nwrite to Mr. Thomas Walker of Manchester, and after informing him of my\r\nintention of giving up the work for the purpose of general information,\r\nI informed him of what I apprehended would be the consequence; that\r\nwhile the work was at a price that precluded an extensive circulation,\r\nthe government party, not able to controvert the plans, arguments,\r\nand principles it contained, had chosen to remain silent; but that I\r\nexpected they would make an attempt to deprive the mass of the nation,\r\nand especially the poor, of the right of reading, by the pretence of\r\nprosecuting either the Author or the Publisher, or both. They chose to\r\nbegin with the Publisher.\r\n\r\nNearly a month, however, passed, before I had any information given me\r\nof their intentions. I was then at Bromley, in Kent, upon which I came\r\nimmediately to town, (May 14) and went to Mr. Jordan, the publisher of\r\nthe original edition. He had that evening been served with a summons to\r\nappear at the Court of King's Bench, on the Monday following, but for\r\nwhat purpose was not stated. Supposing it to be on account of the\r\nwork, I appointed a meeting with him on the next morning, which was\r\naccordingly had, when I provided an attorney, and took the ex-pence of\r\nthe defence on myself. But finding afterwards that he absented himself\r\nfrom the attorney employed, and had engaged another, and that he had\r\nbeen closeted with the Solicitors of the Treasury, I left him to follow\r\nhis own choice, and he chose to plead Guilty. This he might do if he\r\npleased; and I make no objection against him for it. I believe that his\r\nidea by the word _Guilty_, was no other than declaring himself to be the\r\npublisher, without any regard to the merits or demerits of the work; for\r\nwere it to be construed otherwise, it would amount to the absurdity of\r\nconverting a publisher into a Jury, and his confession into a verdict\r\nupon the work itself. This would be the highest possible refinement upon\r\npacking of Juries.\r\n\r\nOn the 21st of May, they commenced their prosecution against me, as the\r\nauthor, by leaving a summons at my lodgings in town, to appear at the\r\nCourt of King's Bench on the 8th of June following; and on the same day,\r\n(May 21,) _they issued also their Proclamation_. Thus the Court of St.\r\nJames and the Court of King's Bench, were playing into each other's\r\nhands at the same instant of time, and the farce of Addresses brought up\r\nthe rear; and this mode of proceeding is called by the prostituted name\r\nof Law. Such a thundering rapidity, after a ministerial dormancy of\r\nalmost eighteen months, can be attributed to no other cause than their\r\nhaving gained information of the forwardness of the cheap Edition, and\r\nthe dread they felt at the progressive increase of political knowledge.\r\n\r\nI was strongly advised by several gentlemen, as well those in the\r\npractice of the law, as others, to prefer a bill of indictment\r\nagainst the publisher of the Proclamation, as a publication tending to\r\ninfluence, or rather to dictate the verdict of a Jury on the issue of a\r\nmatter then pending; but it appeared to me much better to avail myself\r\nof the opportunity which such a precedent justified me in using, by\r\nmeeting the Proclamation and the Addressers on their own ground, and\r\npublicly defending the Work which had been thus unwarrantably attacked\r\nand traduced.--And conscious as I now am, that the Work entitled\r\nRights OF Man so far from being, as has been maliciously or erroneously\r\nrepresented, a false, wicked, and seditious libel, is a work abounding\r\nwith unanswerable truths, with principles of the purest morality and\r\nbenevolence, and with arguments not to be controverted--Conscious, I\r\nsay, of these things, and having no object in view but the happiness\r\nof mankind, I have now put the matter to the best proof in my power, by\r\ngiving to the public a cheap edition of the First and Second Parts of\r\nthat Work. Let every man read and judge for himself, not only of the\r\nmerits and demerits of the Work, but of the matters therein contained,\r\nwhich relate to his own interest and happiness.\r\n\r\nIf, to expose the fraud and imposition of monarchy, and every species\r\nof hereditary government--to lessen the oppression of taxes--to propose\r\nplans for the education of helpless infancy, and the comfortable support\r\nof the aged and distressed--to endeavour to conciliate nations to each\r\nother--to extirpate the horrid practice of war--to promote universal\r\npeace, civilization, and commerce--and to break the chains of political\r\nsuperstition, and raise degraded man to his proper rank;--if these\r\nthings be libellous, let me live the life of a Libeller, and let the\r\nname of Libeller be engraved on my tomb.\r\n\r\nOf all the weak and ill-judged measures which fear, ignorance,\r\nor arrogance could suggest, the Proclamation, and the project for\r\nAddresses, are two of the worst. They served to advertise the work which\r\nthe promoters of those measures wished to keep unknown; and in doing\r\nthis they offered violence to the judgment of the people, by calling on\r\nthem to condemn what they forbad them to know, and put the strength\r\nof their party to that hazardous issue that prudence would have\r\navoided.--The County Meeting for Middlesex was attended by only\r\none hundred and eighteen Addressers. They, no doubt, expected, that\r\nthousands would flock to their standard, and clamor against the _Rights\r\nof Man_. But the case most probably is, that men in all countries, are\r\nnot so blind to their Rights and their Interest as Governments believe.\r\n\r\nHaving thus shewn the extraordinary manner in which the Government party\r\ncommenced their attack, I proceed to offer a few observations on the\r\nprosecution, and on the mode of trial by Special Jury.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, I have written a book; and if it cannot be refuted,\r\nit cannot be condemned. But I do not consider the prosecution as\r\nparticularly levelled against me, but against the general right, or\r\nthe right of every man, of investigating systems and principles of\r\ngovernment, and shewing their several excellencies or defects. If the\r\npress be free only to flatter Government, as Mr. Burke has done, and to\r\ncry up and extol what certain Court sycophants are pleased to call a\r\n\"glorious Constitution,\" and not free to examine into its errors or\r\nabuses, or whether a Constitution really exist or not, such freedom is\r\nno other than that of Spain, Turkey, or Russia; and a Jury in this case,\r\nwould not be a Jury to try, but an Inquisition to condemn.\r\n\r\nI have asserted, and by fair and open argument maintained, the right\r\nof every nation at all times to establish such a system and form of\r\ngovernment for itself as best accords with its disposition, interest,\r\nand happiness; and to change and alter it as it sees occasion. Will any\r\nJury deny to the Nation this right? If they do, they are traitors, and\r\ntheir verdict would be null and void. And if they admit the right, the\r\nmeans must be admitted also; for it would be the highest absurdity to\r\nsay, that the right existed, but the means did not. The question then\r\nis, What are the means by which the possession and exercise of\r\nthis National Right are to be secured? The answer will be, that\r\nof maintaining, inviolably, the right of free investigation; for\r\ninvestigation always serves to detect error, and to bring forth truth.\r\n\r\nI have, as an individual, given my opinion upon what I believe to be\r\nnot only the best, but the true system of Government, which is the\r\nrepresentative system, and I have given reasons for that opinion.\r\n\r\nFirst, Because in the representative system, no office of very\r\nextraordinary power, or extravagant pay, is attached to any individual;\r\nand consequently there is nothing to excite those national contentions\r\nand civil wars with which countries under monarchical governments are\r\nfrequently convulsed, and of which the History of England exhibits such\r\nnumerous instances.\r\n\r\nSecondly, Because the representative is a system of Government always\r\nin maturity; whereas monarchical government fluctuates through all the\r\nstages, from non-age to dotage.\r\n\r\nThirdly, Because the representative system admits of none but men\r\nproperly qualified into the Government, or removes them if they prove\r\nto be otherwise. Whereas, in the hereditary system, a nation may be\r\nencumbered with a knave or an ideot for a whole life-time, and not be\r\nbenefited by a successor.\r\n\r\nFourthly, Because there does not exist a right to establish hereditary\r\ngovernment, or, in other words, hereditary successors, because\r\nhereditary government always means a government yet to come, and the\r\ncase always is, that those who are to live afterwards have the same\r\nright to establish government for themselves, as the people had who\r\nlived before them; and, therefore, all laws attempting to establish\r\nhereditary government, are founded on assumption and political fiction.\r\n\r\nIf these positions be truths, and I challenge any man to prove the\r\ncontrary; if they tend to instruct and enlighten mankind, and to free\r\nthem from error, oppression, and political superstition, which are the\r\nobjects I have in view in publishing them, that Jury would commit an act\r\nof injustice to their country, and to me, if not an act of perjury, that\r\nshould call them _false, wicked, and malicious_.\r\n\r\nDragonetti, in his treatise \"On Virtues and Rewards,\" has a paragraph\r\nworthy of being recorded in every country in the world--\"The science\r\n(says he,) of the politician, consists, in, fixing the true point of\r\nhappiness and freedom. Those men deserve the gratitude of ages who\r\nshould discover a mode of government that contained the greatest sum of\r\n_individual happiness_ with the least _national expence_.\" But if Juries\r\nare to be made use of to prohibit enquiry, to suppress truth, and\r\nto stop the progress of knowledge, this boasted palladium of liberty\r\nbecomes the most successful instrument of tyranny.\r\n\r\nAmong the arts practised at the Bar, and from the Bench, to impose\r\nupon the understanding of a Jury, and to obtain a Verdict where\r\nthe consciences of men could not otherwise consent, one of the most\r\nsuccessful has been that of calling _truth a libel_, and of insinuating\r\nthat the words \"_falsely, wickedly, and maliciously_,\" though they\r\nare made the formidable and high sounding part of the charge, are not\r\nmatters of consideration with a Jury. For what purpose, then, are they\r\nretained, unless it be for that of imposition and wilful defamation?\r\n\r\nI cannot conceive a greater violation of order, nor a more abominable\r\ninsult upon morality, and upon human understanding, than to see a man\r\nsitting in the judgment seat, affecting by an antiquated foppery of\r\ndress to impress the audience with awe; then causing witnesses and Jury\r\nto be sworn to truth and justice, himself having officially sworn the\r\nsame; then causing to be read a prosecution against a man charging him\r\nwith having _wickedly and maliciously written and published a certain\r\nfalse, wicked, and seditious book_; and having gone through all this\r\nwith a shew of solemnity, as if he saw the eye of the Almighty darting\r\nthrough the roof of the building like a ray of light, turn, in an\r\ninstant, the whole into a farce, and, in order to obtain a verdict\r\nthat could not otherwise be obtained, tell the Jury that the charge of\r\n_falsely, wickedly, and seditiously_, meant nothing; that _truth_ was\r\nout of the question; and that whether the person accused spoke truth or\r\nfalsehood, or intended _virtuously or wickedly_, was the same thing;\r\nand finally conclude the wretched inquisitorial scene, by stating\r\nsome antiquated precedent, equally as abominable as that which is then\r\nacting, or giving some opinion of his own, and _falsely calling the one\r\nand the other--Law_. It was, most probably, to such a Judge as this,\r\nthat the most solemn of all reproofs was given--\"_The Lord will smite\r\nthee, thou whitened wall_.\"\r\n\r\nI now proceed to offer some remarks on what is called a Special Jury. As\r\nto what is called a Special Verdict, I shall make no other remark upon\r\nit, than that it is in reality _not_ a verdict. It is an attempt on the\r\npart of the Jury to delegate, or of the Bench to obtain, the exercise of\r\nthat right, which is committed to the Jury only.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the Special Juries, I shall state such matters as I have\r\nbeen able to collect, for I do not find any uniform opinion concerning\r\nthe mode of appointing them.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, this mode of trial is but of modern invention, and\r\nthe origin of it, as I am told, is as follows:\r\n\r\nFormerly, when disputes arose between Merchants, and were brought before\r\na Court, the case was that the nature of their commerce, and the method\r\nof keeping Merchants' accounts not being sufficiently understood by\r\npersons out of their own line, it became necessary to depart from the\r\ncommon mode of appointing Juries, and to select such persons for a Jury\r\nwhose _practical knowledge_ would enable them to decide upon the case.\r\nFrom this introduction, Special Juries became more general; but some\r\ndoubts having arisen as to their legality, an act was passed in the 3d\r\nof George II. to establish them as legal, and also to extend them to all\r\ncases, not only between individuals, but in cases where _the Government\r\nitself should be the prosecutor_. This most probably gave rise to the\r\nsuspicion so generally entertained of packing a Jury; because, by this\r\nact, when the Crown, as it is called, is the Prosecutor, the Master of\r\nthe Crown-office, who holds his office under the Crown, is the person\r\nwho either wholly nominates, or has great power in nominating the Jury,\r\nand therefore it has greatly the appearance of the prosecuting party\r\nselecting a Jury.\r\n\r\nThe process is as follows:\r\n\r\nOn motion being made in Court, by either the Plaintiff or Defendant, for\r\na Special Jury, the Court grants it or not, at its own discretion.\r\n\r\nIf it be granted, the Solicitor of the party that applied for the\r\nSpecial Jury, gives notice to the Solicitor of the adverse party, and a\r\nday and hour are appointed for them to meet at the office of the Master\r\nof the Crown-office. The Master of the Crown-office sends to the Sheriff\r\nor his deputy, who attends with the Sheriff's book of Freeholders. From\r\nthis book, forty-eight names are taken, and a copy thereof given to each\r\nof the parties; and, on a future day, notice is again given, and the\r\nSolicitors meet a second time, and each strikes out twelve names. The\r\nlist being thus reduced from forty-eight to twenty-four, the first\r\ntwelve that appear in Court, and answer to their names, is the Special\r\nJury for that cause. The first operation, that of taking the forty-eight\r\nnames, is called nominating the Jury; and the reducing them to\r\ntwenty-four is called striking the Jury.\r\n\r\nHaving thus stated the general process, I come to particulars, and the\r\nfirst question will be, how are the forty-eight names, out of which the\r\nJury is to be struck, obtained from the Sheriff's book? For herein lies\r\nthe principal ground of suspicion, with respect to what is understood by\r\npacking of Juries.\r\n\r\nEither they must be taken by some rule agreed upon between the parties,\r\nor by some common rule known and established beforehand, or at the\r\ndiscretion of some person, who in such a case, ought to be perfectly\r\ndisinterested in the issue, as well officially as otherwise.\r\n\r\nIn the case of Merchants, and in all cases between individuals,\r\nthe Master of the office, called the Crown-office, is officially an\r\nindifferent person, and as such may be a proper person to act between\r\nthe parties, and present them with a list of forty-eight names, out of\r\nwhich each party is to strike twelve. But the case assumes an entire\r\ndifference of character, when the Government itself is the Prosecutor.\r\nThe Master of the Crown-office is then an officer holding his office\r\nunder the Prosecutor; and it is therefore no wonder that the suspicion\r\nof packing Juries should, in such cases, have been so prevalent.\r\n\r\nThis will apply with additional force, when the prosecution is commenced\r\nagainst the Author or Publisher of such Works as treat of reforms, and\r\nof the abolition of superfluous places and offices, &c, because in such\r\ncases every person holding an office, subject to that suspicion, becomes\r\ninterested as a party; and the office, called the Crown-office, may,\r\nupon examination, be found to be of this description.\r\n\r\nI have heard it asserted, that the Master of the Crown-office is to open\r\nthe sheriff's book as it were per hazard, and take thereout forty-eight\r\n_following_ names, to which the word Merchant or Esquire is affixed.\r\nThe former of these are certainly proper, when the case is between\r\nMerchants, and it has reference to the origin of the custom, and to\r\nnothing else. As to the word Esquire, every man is an Esquire who\r\npleases to call himself Esquire; and the sensible part of mankind are\r\nleaving it off. But the matter for enquiry is, whether there be any\r\nexisting law to direct the mode by which the forty-eight names shall be\r\ntaken, or whether the mode be merely that of custom which the office has\r\ncreated; or whether the selection of the forty-eight names be wholly\r\nat the discretion and choice of the Master of the Crown-office? One or\r\nother of the two latter appears to be the case, because the act already\r\nmentioned, of the 3d of George II. lays down no rule or mode, nor refers\r\nto any preceding law--but says only, that Special Juries shall hereafter\r\nbe struck, \"_in such manner as Special Juries have been and are usually\r\nstruck_.\"\r\n\r\nThis act appears to have been what is generally understood by a \"_deep\r\ntake in_.\" It was fitted to the spur of the moment in which it was\r\npassed, 3d of George II. when parties ran high, and it served to throw\r\ninto the hands of Walpole, who was then Minister, the management of\r\nJuries in Crown prosecutions, by making the nomination of the\r\nforty-eight persons, from whom the Jury was to be struck, follow the\r\nprecedent established by custom between individuals, and by this means\r\nslipt into practice with less suspicion. Now, the manner of obtaining\r\nSpecial Juries through the medium of an officer of the Government, such,\r\nfor instance, as a Master of the Crown-office, may be impartial in the\r\ncase of Merchants or other individuals, but it becomes highly improper\r\nand suspicious in cases where the Government itself is one of the\r\nparties. And it must, upon the whole, appear a strange inconsistency,\r\nthat a Government should keep one officer to commence prosecutions, and\r\nanother officer to nominate the forty-eight persons from whom the Jury\r\nis to be struck, both of whom are _officers of the Civil List_, and yet\r\ncontinue to call this by the pompous name of _the glorious \"Right of\r\ntrial by Jury!_\"\r\n\r\nIn the case of the King against Jordan, for publishing the Rights of\r\nMan, the Attorney-General moved for the appointment of a Special Jury,\r\nand the Master of the Crown-office nominated the forty-eight persons\r\nhimself, and took them from such part of the Sheriff's book as he\r\npleased.\r\n\r\nThe trial did not come on, occasioned by Jordan withdrawing his plea;\r\nbut if it had, it might have afforded an opportunity of discussing the\r\nsubject of Special Juries; for though such discussion might have had\r\nno effect in the Court of King's Bench, it would, in the present\r\ndisposition for enquiry, have had a considerable effect upon the\r\nCountry; and, in all national reforms, this is the proper point to begin\r\nat. But a Country right, and it will soon put Government right. Among\r\nthe improper things acted by the Government in the case of Special\r\nJuries, on their own motion, one has been that of treating the Jury with\r\na dinner, and afterwards giving each Juryman two guineas, if a verdict\r\nbe found for the prosecution, and only one if otherwise; and it has been\r\nlong observed, that, in London and Westminster, there are persons who\r\nappear to make a trade of serving, by being so frequently seen upon\r\nSpecial Juries.\r\n\r\nThus much for Special Juries. As to what is called a _Common Jury_, upon\r\nany Government prosecution against the Author or Publisher of RIGHTS OF\r\nMan, during the time of the _present Sheriffry_, I have one question\r\nto offer, which is, _whether the present Sheriffs of London, having\r\npublicly prejudged the case, by the part they have taken in procuring\r\nan Address from the county of Middlesex, (however diminutive and\r\ninsignificant the number of Addressers were, being only one hundred and\r\neighteen,) are eligible or proper persons to be intrusted with the power\r\nof returning a Jury to try the issue of any such prosecution_.\r\n\r\nBut the whole matter appears, at least to me, to be worthy of a more\r\nextensive consideration than what relates to any Jury, whether Special\r\nor Common; for the case is, whether any part of a whole nation, locally\r\nselected as a Jury of twelve men always is, be competent to judge and\r\ndetermine for the whole nation, on any matter that relates to systems\r\nand principles of Government, and whether it be not applying the\r\ninstitution of Juries to purposes for which such institutions were not\r\nintended? For example,\r\n\r\nI have asserted, in the Work Rights of Man, that as every man in the\r\nnation pays taxes, so has every man a right to a share in government,\r\nand consequently that the people of Manchester, Birmingham, Sheffield,\r\nLeeds, Halifax, &c have the same right as those of London. Shall, then,\r\ntwelve men, picked out between Temple-bar and Whitechapel, because the\r\nbook happened to be first published there, decide upon the rights of\r\nthe inhabitants of those towns, or of any other town or village in the\r\nnation?\r\n\r\nHaving thus spoken of Juries, I come next to offer a few observations on\r\nthe matter contained in the information or prosecution.\r\n\r\nThe work, Rights of Man, consists of Part the First, and Fart the\r\nSecond. The First Part the prosecutor has thought it most proper to let\r\nalone; and from the Second Fart he has selected a few short paragraphs,\r\nmaking in the whole not quite two pages of the same printing as in the\r\ncheap edition. Those paragraphs relate chiefly to certain facts, such\r\nas the revolution of 1688, and the coming of George the First, commonly\r\ncalled of the House of Hanover, or the House of Brunswick, or some such\r\nHouse. The arguments, plans and principles contained in the work, the\r\nprosecutor has not ventured to attack. They are beyond his reach.\r\n\r\nThe Act which the prosecutor appears to rest most upon for the support\r\nof the prosecution, is the Act intituled, \"An Act, declaring the rights\r\nand liberties of the subject, and settling the succession of the crown,\"\r\npassed in the first year of William and Mary, and more commonly known by\r\nthe name of the \"Bill of Rights.\"\r\n\r\nI have called this bill \"_A Bill of wrongs and of insult_.\" My reasons,\r\nand also my proofs, are as follow:\r\n\r\nThe method and principle which this Bill takes for declaring rights and\r\nliberties, are in direct contradiction to rights and liberties; it is an\r\nassumed attempt to take them wholly from posterity--for the declaration\r\nin the said Bill is as follows:\r\n\r\n\"The Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, do, in _the name of all\r\nthe people_, most humbly and faithfully _submit themselves, their heirs,\r\nand posterity for ever_;\" that is, to William and Mary his wife, their\r\nheirs and successors. This is a strange way of declaring rights and\r\nliberties. But the Parliament who made this declaration in the name, and\r\non the part, of the people, had no authority from them for so doing;\r\nand with respect to _posterity for ever_, they had no right or authority\r\nwhatever in the case. It was assumption and usurpation. I have reasoned\r\nvery extensively against the principle of this Bill, in the first part\r\nof Rights of Man; the prosecutor has silently admitted that reasoning,\r\nand he now commences a prosecution on the authority of the Bill, after\r\nadmitting the reasoning against it.\r\n\r\nIt is also to be observed, that the declaration in this Bill, abject and\r\nirrational as it is, had no other intentional operation than against the\r\nfamily of the Stuarts, and their abettors. The idea did not then exist,\r\nthat in the space of an hundred years, posterity might discover a\r\ndifferent and much better system of government, and that every species\r\nof hereditary government might fall, as Popes and Monks had fallen\r\nbefore. This, I say, was not then thought of, and therefore the\r\napplication of the Bill, in the present case, is a new, erroneous, and\r\nillegal application, and is the same as creating a new Bill _ex post\r\nfacto_.\r\n\r\nIt has ever been the craft of Courtiers, for the purpose of keeping\r\nup an expensive and enormous Civil List, and a mummery of useless and\r\nantiquated places and offices at the public expence, to be continually\r\nhanging England upon some individual or other, called _King_, though\r\nthe man might not have capacity to be a parish constable. The folly and\r\nabsurdity of this, is appearing more and more every day; and still those\r\nmen continue to act as if no alteration in the public opinion had taken\r\nplace. They hear each other's nonsense, and suppose the whole nation\r\ntalks the same Gibberish.\r\n\r\nLet such men cry up the House of Orange, or the House of Brunswick,\r\nif they please. They would cry up any other house if it suited their\r\npurpose, and give as good reasons for it. But what is this house, or\r\nthat house, or any other house to a nation? \"_For a nation to be free,\r\nit is sufficient that she wills it_.\" Her freedom depends wholly upon\r\nherself, and not on any house, nor on any individual. I ask not in what\r\nlight this cargo of foreign houses appears to others, but I will say in\r\nwhat light it appears to me--It was like the trees of the forest, saying\r\nunto the bramble, come thou and reign over us.\r\n\r\nThus much for both their houses. I now come to speak of two other\r\nhouses, which are also put into the information, and those are the\r\nHouse of Lords, and the House of Commons. Here, I suppose, the\r\nAttorney-General intends to prove me guilty of speaking either truth\r\nor falsehood; for, according to the modern interpretation of Libels, it\r\ndoes not signify which, and the only improvement necessary to shew the\r\ncompleat absurdity of such doctrine, would be, to prosecute a man for\r\nuttering a most _false and wicked truth_.\r\n\r\nI will quote the part I am going to give, from the Office Copy, with the\r\nAttorney General's inuendoes, enclosed in parentheses as they stand in\r\nthe information, and I hope that civil list officer will caution the\r\nCourt not to laugh when he reads them, and also to take care not to\r\nlaugh himself.\r\n\r\nThe information states, that _Thomas Paine, being a wicked, malicious,\r\nseditious, and evil-disposed person, hath, with force and arms, and\r\nmost wicked cunning, written and published a certain false, scandalous,\r\nmalicious, and seditious libel; in one part thereof, to the tenor and\r\neffect following, that is to say_--\r\n\r\n\"With respect to the two Houses, of which the English Parliament\r\n(_meaning the Parliament of this Kingdom_) is composed, they appear to\r\nbe effectually influenced into one, and, as a Legislature, to have no\r\ntemper of its own. The Minister, (_meaning the Minuter employed by the\r\nKing of this Realm, in the administration of the Government thereof_)\r\nwhoever he at any time may be, touches it (_meaning the two Houses of\r\nParliament of this Kingdom_) as with an opium wand, and it (_meaning the\r\ntwo Houses of Parliament of this Kingdom_) sleeps obedience.\"\r\n\r\nAs I am not malicious enough to disturb their repose, though it be time\r\nthey should awake, I leave the two Houses and the Attorney General, to\r\nthe enjoyment of their dreams, and proceed to a new subject.\r\n\r\nThe Gentlemen, to whom I shall next address myself, are those who have\r\nstiled themselves \"_Friends of the people_,\" holding their meeting at\r\nthe Freemasons' Tavern, London.(1)\r\n\r\nOne of the principal Members of this Society, is Mr. Grey, who, I\r\nbelieve, is also one of the most independent Members in Parliament.(2)\r\nI collect this opinion from what Mr. Burke formerly mentioned to me,\r\nrather than from any knowledge of my own. The occasion was as follows:\r\n\r\nI was in England at the time the bubble broke forth about Nootka Sound:\r\nand the day after the King's Message, as it is called, was sent to\r\nParliament, I wrote a note to Mr. Burke, that upon the condition the\r\nFrench Revolution should not be a subject (for he was then writing\r\nthe book I have since answered) I would call on him the next day, and\r\nmention some matters I was acquainted with, respecting the affair; for\r\nit appeared to me extraordinary that any body of men, calling themselves\r\nRepresentatives, should commit themselves so precipitately, or \"sleep\r\nobedience,\" as Parliament was then doing, and run a nation into expence,\r\nand perhaps a war, without so much as enquiring into the case, or the\r\nsubject, of both which I had some knowledge.\r\n\r\n     1 See in the Introduction to this volume Chauvelin's account\r\n     of this Association.--_Editor._\r\n\r\n     2  In the debate in the House of Commons, Dec. 14, 1793, Mr.\r\n     Grey is thus reported: \"Mr. Grey was not a friend to\r\n     Paine's doctrines, but he was not to be deterred by a man\r\n     from acknowledging that he considered the rights of man as\r\n     the foundation of every government, and those who stood out\r\n     against those rights as conspirators against the people.\" He\r\n     severely denounced the Proclamation.   Parl. Hist., vol.\r\n     xxvi.--_Editor._\r\n\r\nWhen I saw Mr. Burke, and mentioned the circumstances to him, he\r\nparticularly spoke of Mr. Grey, as the fittest Member to bring such\r\nmatters forward; \"for,\" said Mr. Burke, \"_I am not the proper_ person to\r\ndo it, as I am in a treaty with Mr. Pitt about Mr. Hastings's trial.\" I\r\nhope the Attorney General will allow, that Mr. Burke was then _sleeping\r\nhis obedience_.--But to return to the Society------\r\n\r\nI cannot bring myself to believe, that the general motive of this\r\nSociety is any thing more than that by which every former parliamentary\r\nopposition has been governed, and by which the present is sufficiently\r\nknown. Failing in their pursuit of power and place within doors, they\r\nhave now (and that in not a very mannerly manner) endeavoured to possess\r\nthemselves of that ground out of doors, which, had it not been made\r\nby others, would not have been made by them. They appear to me to have\r\nwatched, with more cunning than candour, the progress of a certain\r\npublication, and when they saw it had excited a spirit of enquiry,\r\nand was rapidly spreading, they stepped forward to profit by the\r\nopportunity, and Mr. Fox _then_ called it a Libel. In saying this, he\r\nlibelled himself. Politicians of this cast, such, I mean, as those who\r\ntrim between parties, and lye by for events, are to be found in every\r\ncountry, and it never yet happened that they did not do more harm\r\nthan good. They embarrass business, fritter it to nothing, perplex the\r\npeople, and the event to themselves generally is, that they go just\r\nfar enough to make enemies of the few, without going far enough to make\r\nfriends of the many.\r\n\r\nWhoever will read the declarations of this Society, of the 25th of April\r\nand 5th of May, will find a studied reserve upon all the points that are\r\nreal abuses. They speak not once of the extravagance of Government, of\r\nthe abominable list of unnecessary and sinecure places and pensions, of\r\nthe enormity of the Civil List, of the excess of taxes, nor of any one\r\nmatter that substantially affects the nation; and from some conversation\r\nthat has passed in that Society, it does not appear to me that it is\r\nany part of their plan to carry this class of reforms into practice. No\r\nOpposition Party ever did, when it gained possession.\r\n\r\nIn making these free observations, I mean not to enter into contention\r\nwith this Society; their incivility towards me is what I should expect\r\nfrom place-hunting reformers. They are welcome, however, to the ground\r\nthey have advanced upon, and I wish that every individual among them may\r\nact in the same upright, uninfluenced, and public spirited manner that I\r\nhave done. Whatever reforms may be obtained, and by whatever means,\r\nthey will be for the benefit of others and not of me. I have no other\r\ninterest in the cause than the interest of my heart. The part I have\r\nacted has been wholly that of a volunteer, unconnected with party; and\r\nwhen I quit, it shall be as honourably as I began.\r\n\r\nI consider the reform of Parliament, by an application to Parliament, as\r\nproposed by the Society, to be a worn-out hackneyed subject, about which\r\nthe nation is tired, and the parties are deceiving each other. It is not\r\na subject that is cognizable before Parliament, because no Government\r\nhas a right to alter itself, either in whole or in part. The right,\r\nand the exercise of that right, appertains to the nation only, and the\r\nproper means is by a national convention, elected for the purpose, by\r\nall the people. By this, the will of the nation, whether to reform or\r\nnot, or what the reform shall be, or how far it shall extend, will be\r\nknown, and it cannot be known by any other means. Partial addresses, or\r\nseparate associations, are not testimonies of the general will.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, certain, that the opinions of men, with respect\r\nto systems and principles of government, are changing fast in all\r\ncountries. The alteration in England, within the space of a little more\r\nthan a year, is far greater than could have been believed, and it is\r\ndaily and hourly increasing. It moves along the country with the silence\r\nof thought. The enormous expence of Government has provoked men to\r\nthink, by making them feel; and the Proclamation has served to increase\r\njealousy and disgust. To prevent, therefore, those commotions which too\r\noften and too suddenly arise from suffocated discontents, it is best\r\nthat the general WILL should have the full and free opportunity of being\r\npublicly ascertained and known.\r\n\r\nWretched as the state of representation is in England, it is every\r\nday becoming worse, because the unrepresented parts of the nation are\r\nincreasing in population and property, and the represented parts are\r\ndecreasing. It is, therefore, no ill-grounded estimation to say, that\r\nas not one person in seven is represented, at least fourteen millions of\r\ntaxes out of the seventeen millions, are paid by the unrepresented part;\r\nfor although copyholds and leaseholds are assessed to the land-tax, the\r\nholders are unrepresented. Should then a general demur take place as to\r\nthe obligation of paying taxes, on the ground of not being represented,\r\nit is not the Representatives of Rotten Boroughs, nor Special Juries,\r\nthat can decide the question. This is one of the possible cases that\r\nought to be foreseen, in order to prevent the inconveniencies that might\r\narise to numerous individuals, by provoking it.\r\n\r\nI confess I have no idea of petitioning for rights. Whatever the rights\r\nof people are, they have a right to them, and none have a right either\r\nto withhold them, or to grant them. Government ought to be established\r\non such principles of justice as to exclude the occasion of all such\r\napplications, for wherever they appear they are virtually accusations.\r\n\r\nI wish that Mr. Grey, since he has embarked in the business, would take\r\nthe whole of it into consideration. He will then see that the right of\r\nreforming the state of the Representation does not reside in Parliament,\r\nand that the only motion he could consistently make would be, that\r\nParliament should _recommend_ the election of a convention of the\r\npeople, because all pay taxes. But whether Parliament recommended it\r\nor not, the right of the nation would neither be lessened nor increased\r\nthereby.\r\n\r\nAs to Petitions from the unrepresented part, they ought not to be looked\r\nfor. As well might it be expected that Manchester, Sheffield, &c.\r\nshould petition the rotten Boroughs, as that they should petition the\r\nRepresentatives of those Boroughs. Those two towns alone pay far more\r\ntaxes than all the rotten Boroughs put together, and it is scarcely to\r\nbe expected they should pay their court either to the Boroughs, or the\r\nBorough-mongers.\r\n\r\nIt ought also to be observed, that what is called Parliament, is\r\ncomposed of two houses that have always declared against the right of\r\neach other to interfere in any matter that related to the circumstances\r\nof either, particularly that of election. A reform, therefore, in the\r\nrepresentation cannot, on the ground they have individually taken,\r\nbecome the subject of an act of Parliament, because such a mode would\r\ninclude the interference, against which the Commons on their part have\r\nprotested; but must, as well on the ground of formality, as on that of\r\nright, proceed from a National Convention.\r\n\r\nLet Mr. Grey, or any other man, sit down and endeavour to put his\r\nthoughts together, for the purpose of drawing up an application to\r\nParliament for a reform of Parliament, and he will soon convince himself\r\nof the folly of the attempt. He will find that he cannot get on; that\r\nhe cannot make his thoughts join, so as to produce any effect; for,\r\nwhatever formality of words he may use, they will unavoidably include\r\ntwo ideas directly opposed to each other; the one in setting forth\r\nthe reasons, the other in praying for relief, and the two, when placed\r\ntogether, would stand thus: \"_The Representation in Parliament is so\r\nvery corrupt, that we can no longer confide in it,--and, therefore,\r\nconfiding in the justice and wisdom of Parliament, we pray_,\" &c, &c.\r\n\r\nThe heavy manner in which every former proposed application to\r\nParliament has dragged, sufficiently shews, that though the nation might\r\nnot exactly see the awkwardness of the measure, it could not clearly see\r\nits way, by those means. To this also may be added another remark, which\r\nis, that the worse Parliament is, the less will be the inclination to\r\npetition it. This indifference, viewed as it ought to be, is one of the\r\nstrongest censures the public express. It is as if they were to say to\r\nthem, \"Ye are not worth reforming.\"\r\n\r\nLet any man examine the Court-Kalendar of Placemen in both Houses, and\r\nthe manner in which the Civil List operates, and he will be at no loss\r\nto account for this indifference and want of confidence on one side, nor\r\nof the opposition to reforms on the other.\r\n\r\nWho would have supposed that Mr. Burke, holding forth as he formerly\r\ndid against secret influence, and corrupt majorities, should become\r\na concealed Pensioner? I will now state the case, not for the little\r\npurpose of exposing Mr. Burke, but to shew the inconsistency of any\r\napplication to a body of men, more than half of whom, as far as the\r\nnation can at present know, may be in the same case with himself.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of Lord North's administration, Mr. Burke brought a bill\r\ninto Parliament, generally known by Mr. Burke's Reform Bill; in which,\r\namong other things, it is enacted, \"That no pension exceeding the sum\r\nof three hundred pounds a year, shall be granted to any one person,\r\nand that the whole amount of the pensions granted in one year shall not\r\nexceed six hundred pounds; a list of which, together with the _names\r\nof the persons_ to whom the same are granted, shall be laid before\r\nParliament in twenty days after the beginning of each session, until\r\nthe whole pension list shall be reduced to ninety thousand pounds.\" A\r\nprovisory clause is afterwards added, \"That it shall be lawful for the\r\nFirst Commissioner of the Treasury, to return into the Exchequer any\r\npension or annuity, _without a name_, on his making oath that such\r\npension or annuity is not directly or indirectly for the benefit, use,\r\nor behoof of any Member of the House of Commons.\"\r\n\r\nBut soon after that administration ended, and the party Mr. Burke acted\r\nwith came into power, it appears from the circumstances I am going to\r\nrelate, that Mr. Burke became himself a Pensioner in disguise; in a\r\nsimilar manner as if a pension had been granted in the name of John\r\nNokes, to be privately paid to and enjoyed by Tom Stiles. The name of\r\nEdmund Burke does not appear in the original transaction: but after the\r\npension was obtained, Mr. Burke wanted to make the most of it at once,\r\nby selling or mortgaging it; and the gentleman in whose name the pension\r\nstands, applied to one of the public offices for that purpose. This\r\nunfortunately brought forth the name of _Edmund Burke_, as the real\r\nPensioner of 1,500L. per annum.(1) When men trumpet forth what they call\r\nthe blessings of the Constitution, it ought to be known what sort of\r\nblessings they allude to.\r\n\r\nAs to the Civil List of a million a year, it is not to be supposed that\r\nany one man can eat, drink, or consume the whole upon himself. The case\r\nis, that above half the sum is annually apportioned among Courtiers,\r\nand Court Members, of both Houses, in places and offices, altogether\r\ninsignificant and perfectly useless as to every purpose of civil,\r\nrational, and manly government. For instance,\r\n\r\nOf what use in the science and system of Government is what is called\r\na Lord Chamberlain, a Master and Mistress of the Robes, a Master of the\r\nHorse, a Master of the Hawks, and one hundred other such things? Laws\r\nderive no additional force, nor additional excellence from such mummery.\r\n\r\nIn the disbursements of the Civil List for the year 1786, (which may be\r\nseen in Sir John Sinclair's History of the Revenue,) are four separate\r\ncharges for this mummery office of Chamberlain:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: table110]\r\n\r\nFrom this sample the rest may be guessed at. As to the Master of the\r\nHawks, (there are no hawks kept, and if there were, it is no reason the\r\npeople should pay the expence of feeding them, many of whom are put to\r\nit to get bread for their children,) his salary is 1,372L. 10s.\r\n\r\n     1 See note at the end of this chapter.--_Editor._\r\n\r\nAnd besides a list of items of this kind, sufficient to fill a quire of\r\npaper, the Pension lists alone are 107,404L. 13s. 4d. which is a greater\r\nsum than all the expences of the federal Government in America amount\r\nto.\r\n\r\nAmong the items, there are two I had no expectation of finding, and\r\nwhich, in this day of enquiry after Civil List influence, ought to be\r\nexposed. The one is an annual payment of one thousand seven hundred\r\npounds to the Dissenting Ministers in England, and the other, eight\r\nhundred pounds to those of Ireland.\r\n\r\nThis is the fact; and the distribution, as I am informed, is as follows:\r\nThe whole sum of 1,700L. is paid to one person, a Dissenting Minister\r\nin London, who divides it among eight others, and those eight among such\r\nothers as they please. The Lay-body of the Dissenters, and many of their\r\nprincipal Ministers, have long considered it as dishonourable, and have\r\nendeavoured to prevent it, but still it continues to be secretly paid;\r\nand as the world has sometimes seen very fulsome Addresses from parts of\r\nthat body, it may naturally be supposed that the receivers, like Bishops\r\nand other Court-Clergy, are not idle in promoting them. How the money is\r\ndistributed in Ireland, I know not.\r\n\r\nTo recount all the secret history of the Civil List, is not the\r\nintention of this publication. It is sufficient, in this place, to\r\nexpose its general character, and the mass of influence it keeps alive.\r\nIt will necessarily become one of the objects of reform; and therefore\r\nenough is said to shew that, under its operation, no application to\r\nParliament can be expected to succeed, nor can consistently be made.\r\n\r\nSuch reforms will not be promoted by the Party that is in possession of\r\nthose places, nor by the Opposition who are waiting for them; and as\r\nto a _mere reform_, in the state of the Representation, the idea that\r\nanother Parliament, differently elected from the present, but still a\r\nthird component part of the same system, and subject to the controul of\r\nthe other two parts, will abolish those abuses, is altogether delusion;\r\nbecause it is not only impracticable on the ground of formality, but is\r\nunwisely exposing another set of men to the same corruptions that have\r\ntainted the present.\r\n\r\nWere all the objects that require reform accomplishable by a mere reform\r\nin the state of the Representation, the persons who compose the present\r\nParliament might, with rather more propriety, be asked to abolish all\r\nthe abuses themselves, than be applied to as the more instruments of\r\ndoing it by a future Parliament. If the virtue be wanting to abolish the\r\nabuse, it is also wanting to act as the means, and the nation must, from\r\nnecessity, proceed by some other plan.\r\n\r\nHaving thus endeavoured to shew what the abject condition of Parliament\r\nis, and the impropriety of going a second time over the same ground that\r\nhas before miscarried, I come to the remaining part of the subject.\r\n\r\nThere ought to be, in the constitution of every country, a mode of\r\nreferring back, on any extraordinary occasion, to the sovereign and\r\noriginal constituent power, which is the nation itself. The right of\r\naltering any part of a Government, cannot, as already observed, reside\r\nin the Government, or that Government might make itself what it pleased.\r\n\r\nIt ought also to be taken for granted, that though a nation may feel\r\ninconveniences, either in the excess of taxation, or in the mode of\r\nexpenditure, or in any thing else, it may not at first be sufficiently\r\nassured in what part of its government the defect lies, or where the\r\nevil originates. It may be supposed to be in one part, and on enquiry\r\nbe found to be in another; or partly in all. This obscurity is naturally\r\ninterwoven with what are called mixed Governments.\r\n\r\nBe, however, the reform to be accomplished whatever it may, it can only\r\nfollow in consequence of obtaining a full knowledge of all the causes\r\nthat have rendered such reform necessary, and every thing short of this\r\nis guess-work or frivolous cunning. In this case, it cannot be supposed\r\nthat any application to Parliament can bring forward this knowledge.\r\nThat body is itself the supposed cause, or one of the supposed causes,\r\nof the abuses in question; and cannot be expected, and ought not to be\r\nasked, to give evidence against itself. The enquiry, therefore, which\r\nis of necessity the first step in the business, cannot be trusted to\r\nParliament, but must be undertaken by a distinct body of men, separated\r\nfrom every suspicion of corruption or influence.\r\n\r\nInstead, then, of referring to rotten Boroughs and absurd Corporations\r\nfor Addresses, or hawking them about the country to be signed by a few\r\ndependant tenants, the real and effectual mode would be to come at once\r\nto the point, and to ascertain the sense of the nation by electing a\r\nNational Convention. By this method, as already observed, the general\r\nWILL, whether to reform or not, or what the reform shall be, or how\r\nfar it shall extend, will be known, and it cannot be known by any other\r\nmeans. Such a body, empowered and supported by the nation, will have\r\nauthority to demand information upon all matters necessary to be\r\nen-quired into; and no Minister, nor any person, will dare to refuse it.\r\nIt will then be seen whether seventeen millions of taxes are necessary,\r\nand for what purposes they are expended. The concealed Pensioners will\r\nthen be obliged to unmask; and the source of influence and corruption,\r\nif any such there be, will be laid open to the nation, not for the\r\npurpose of revenge, but of redress.\r\n\r\nBy taking this public and national ground, all objections against\r\npartial Addresses on the one side, or private associations on the other,\r\nwill be done away; THE NATION WILL DECLARE ITS OWN REFORMS; and the\r\nclamour about Party and Faction, or Ins or Outs, will become ridiculous.\r\n\r\nThe plan and organization of a convention is easy in practice.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, the number of inhabitants in every county can be\r\nsufficiently ascertained from the number of houses assessed to the\r\nHouse and Window-light tax in each county. This will give the rule\r\nfor apportioning the number of Members to be elected to the National\r\nConvention in each of the counties.\r\n\r\nIf the total number of inhabitants in England be seven millions, and the\r\ntotal number of Members to be elected to the Convention be one thousand,\r\nthe number of members to be elected in a county containing one hundred\r\nand fifty thousand inhabitants will be _twenty-one_, and in like\r\nproportion for any other county.\r\n\r\nAs the election of a Convention must, in order to ascertain the general\r\nsense of the nation, go on grounds different from that of Parliamentary\r\nelections, the mode that best promises this end will have no\r\ndifficulties to combat with from absurd customs and pretended rights.\r\nThe right of every man will be the same, whether he lives in a city,\r\na town, or a village. The custom of attaching Rights to _place_, or\r\nin other words, to inanimate matter, instead of to the _person_,\r\nindependently of place, is too absurd to make any part of a rational\r\nargument.\r\n\r\nAs every man in the nation, of the age of twenty-one years, pays taxes,\r\neither out of the property he possesses, or out of the product of his\r\nlabor, which is property to him; and is amenable in his own person to\r\nevery law of the land; so has every one the same equal right to vote,\r\nand no one part of the nation, nor any individual, has a right to\r\ndispute the right of another. The man who should do this ought to\r\nforfeit the exercise of his _own_ right, for a term of years. This would\r\nrender the punishment consistent with the crime.\r\n\r\nWhen a qualification to vote is regulated by years, it is placed on the\r\nfirmest possible ground; because the qualification is such, as nothing\r\nbut dying before the time can take away; and the equality of Rights, as\r\na principle, is recognized in the act of regulating the exercise. But\r\nwhen Rights are placed upon, or made dependant upon property, they are\r\non the most precarious of all tenures. \"Riches make themselves wings,\r\nand fly away,\" and the rights fly with them; and thus they become lost\r\nto the man when they would be of most value.\r\n\r\nIt is from a strange mixture of tyranny and cowardice, that exclusions\r\nhave been set up and continued. The boldness to do wrong at first,\r\nchanges afterwards into cowardly craft, and at last into fear. The\r\nRepresentatives in England appear now to act as if they were afraid to\r\ndo right, even in part, lest it should awaken the nation to a sense of\r\nall the wrongs it has endured. This case serves to shew, that the same\r\nconduct that best constitutes the safety of an individual, namely,\r\na strict adherence to principle, constitutes also the safety of a\r\nGovernment, and that without it safety is but an empty name. When the\r\nrich plunder the poor of his rights, it becomes an example to the poor\r\nto plunder the rich of his property; for the rights of the one are\r\nas much property to him, as wealth is property to the other, and the\r\n_little all_ is as dear as the _much_. It is only by setting out on just\r\nprinciples that men are trained to be just to each other; and it will\r\nalways be found, that when the rich protect the rights of the poor, the\r\npoor will protect the property of the rich. But the guarantee, to be\r\neffectual, must be parliamentarily reciprocal.\r\n\r\nExclusions are not only unjust, but they frequently operate as\r\ninjuriously to the party who monopolizes, as to those who are excluded.\r\nWhen men seek to exclude others from participating in the exercise of\r\nany right, they should, at least, be assured, that they can effectually\r\nperform the whole of the business they undertake; for, unless they do\r\nthis, themselves will be losers by the monopoly. This has been the case\r\nwith respect to the monopolized right of Election. The monopolizing\r\nparty has not been able to keep the Parliamentary Representation, to\r\nwhom the power of taxation was entrusted, in the state it ought to have\r\nbeen, and have thereby multiplied taxes upon themselves equally with\r\nthose who were excluded.\r\n\r\nA great deal has been, and will continue to be said, about\r\ndisqualifications, arising from the commission of offences; but were\r\nthis subject urged to its full extent, it would disqualify a great\r\nnumber of the present Electors, together with their Representatives;\r\nfor, of all offences, none are more destructive to the morals of Society\r\nthan Bribery and Corruption. It is, therefore, civility to such persons\r\nto pass this subject over, and to give them a fair opportunity of\r\nrecovering, or rather of creating character.\r\n\r\nEvery thing, in the present mode of electioneering in England, is the\r\nreverse of what it ought to be, and the vulgarity that attends elections\r\nis no other than the natural consequence of inverting the order of the\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, the Candidate seeks the Elector, instead of the\r\nElector seeking for a Representative; and the Electors are advertised as\r\nbeing in the interest of the Candidate, instead of the Candidate being\r\nin the interest of the Electors. The Candidate pays the Elector for his\r\nvote, instead of the Nation paying the Representative for his time and\r\nattendance on public business. The complaint for an undue election is\r\nbrought by the Candidate, as if he, and not the Electors, were the party\r\naggrieved; and he takes on himself, at any period of the election, to\r\nbreak it up, by declining, as if the election was in his right and not\r\nin theirs.\r\n\r\nThe compact that was entered into at the last Westminster election\r\nbetween two of the candidates (Mr. Fox and Lord Hood,) was an indecent\r\nviolation of the principles of election. The Candidates assumed, in\r\ntheir own persons, the rights of the Electors; for, it was only in the\r\nbody of the Electors, and not at all in the Candidates, that the\r\nright of making any such compact, or compromise, could exist. But the\r\nprinciple of Election and Representation is so completely done away,\r\nin every stage thereof, that inconsistency has no longer the power of\r\nsurprising.\r\n\r\nNeither from elections thus conducted, nor from rotten Borough\r\nAddressers, nor from County-meetings, promoted by Placemen and\r\nPensioners, can the sense of the nation be known. It is still corruption\r\nappealing to itself. But a Convention of a thousand persons, fairly\r\nelected, would bring every matter to a decided issue.\r\n\r\nAs to County-meetings, it is only persons of leisure, or those who live\r\nnear to the place of meeting, that can attend, and the number on such\r\noccasions is but like a drop in the bucket compared with the whole. The\r\nonly consistent service which such meetings could render, would be that\r\nof apportioning the county into convenient districts, and when this is\r\ndone, each district might, according to its number of inhabitants, elect\r\nits quota of County Members to the National Convention; and the vote of\r\neach Elector might be taken in the parish where he resided, either by\r\nballot or by voice, as he should chuse to give it.\r\n\r\nA National Convention thus formed, would bring together the sense and\r\nopinions of every part of the nation, fairly taken. The science of\r\nGovernment, and the interest of the Public, and of the several parts\r\nthereof, would then undergo an ample and rational discussion, freed from\r\nthe language of parliamentary disguise.\r\n\r\nBut in all deliberations of this kind, though men have a right to\r\nreason with, and endeavour to convince each other, upon any matter that\r\nrespects their common good, yet, in point of practice, the majority of\r\nopinions, when known, forms a rule for the whole, and to this rule every\r\ngood citizen practically conforms.\r\n\r\nMr. Burke, as if he knew, (for every concealed Pensioner has the\r\nopportunity of knowing,) that the abuses acted under the present system,\r\nare too flagrant to be palliated, and that the majority of opinions,\r\nwhenever such abuses should be made public, would be for a general and\r\neffectual reform, has endeavoured to preclude the event, by sturdily\r\ndenying the right of a majority of a nation to act as a whole. Let us\r\nbestow a thought upon this case.\r\n\r\nWhen any matter is proposed as a subject for consultation, it\r\nnecessarily implies some mode of decision. Common consent, arising from\r\nabsolute necessity, has placed this in a majority of opinions; because,\r\nwithout it, there can be no decision, and consequently no order. It is,\r\nperhaps, the only case in which mankind, however various in their ideas\r\nupon other matters, can consistently be unanimous; because it is a mode\r\nof decision derived from the primary original right of every individual\r\nconcerned; _that_ right being first individually exercised in giving an\r\nopinion, and whether that opinion shall arrange with the minority or the\r\nmajority, is a subsequent accidental thing that neither increases nor\r\ndiminishes the individual original right itself. Prior to any debate,\r\nenquiry, or investigation, it is not supposed to be known on which side\r\nthe majority of opinions will fall, and therefore, whilst this mode of\r\ndecision secures to every one the right of giving an opinion, it admits\r\nto every one an equal chance in the ultimate event.\r\n\r\nAmong the matters that will present themselves to the consideration of\r\na national convention, there is one, wholly of a domestic nature, but so\r\nmarvellously loaded with con-fusion, as to appear at first sight, almost\r\nimpossible to be reformed. I mean the condition of what is called Law.\r\n\r\nBut, if we examine into the cause from whence this confusion, now so\r\nmuch the subject of universal complaint, is produced, not only the\r\nremedy will immediately present itself, but, with it, the means of\r\npreventing the like case hereafter.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, the confusion has generated itself from the\r\nabsurdity of every Parliament assuming to be eternal in power, and\r\nthe laws partake in a similar manner, of this assumption. They have no\r\nperiod of legal or natural expiration; and, however absurd in principle,\r\nor inconsistent in practice many of them have become, they still are,\r\nif not especially repealed, considered as making a part of the general\r\nmass. By this means the body of what is called Law, is spread over a\r\nspace of _several hundred years_, comprehending laws obsolete, laws\r\nrepugnant, laws ridiculous, and every other kind of laws forgotten\r\nor remembered; and what renders the case still worse, is, that the\r\nconfusion multiplies with the progress of time. (*)\r\n\r\nTo bring this misshapen monster into form, and to prevent its lapsing\r\nagain into a wilderness state, only two things, and those very simple,\r\nare necessary.\r\n\r\nThe first is, to review the whole mass of laws, and to bring forward\r\nsuch only as are worth retaining, and let all the rest drop; and to give\r\nto the laws so brought forward a new era, commencing from the time of\r\nsuch reform.\r\n\r\n     * In the time of Henry IV. a law was passed making it felony\r\n     \"to multiply gold or silver, or to make use of the craft of\r\n     multiplication,\" and this law remained two hundred and\r\n     eighty-six years upon the statute books. It was then\r\n     repealed as being ridiculous and injurious.--_Author_.\r\n\r\nSecondly; that at the expiration of every twenty-one years (or any other\r\nstated period) a like review shall again be taken, and the laws, found\r\nproper to be retained, be again carried forward, commencing with that\r\ndate, and the useless laws dropped and discontinued.\r\n\r\nBy this means there can be no obsolete laws, and scarcely such a thing\r\nas laws standing in direct or equivocal contradiction to each other, and\r\nevery person will know the period of time to which he is to look back\r\nfor all the laws in being.\r\n\r\nIt is worth remarking, that while every other branch of science is\r\nbrought within some commodious system, and the study of it simplified by\r\neasy methods, the laws take the contrary course, and become every year\r\nmore complicated, entangled, confused, and obscure.\r\n\r\nAmong the paragraphs which the Attorney General has taken from the\r\n_Rights of Man_, and put into his information, one is, that where I\r\nhave said, \"that with respect to regular law, there is _scarcely such a\r\nthing_.\"\r\n\r\nAs I do not know whether the Attorney-General means to show this\r\nexpression to be libellous, because it is TRUE, or because it is FALSE,\r\nI shall make no other reply to him in this place, than by remarking,\r\nthat if almanack-makers had not been more judicious than law-makers,\r\nthe study of almanacks would by this time have become as abstruse as the\r\nstudy of the law, and we should hear of a library of almanacks as we\r\nnow do of statutes; but by the simple operation of letting the obsolete\r\nmatter drop, and carrying forward that only which is proper to be\r\nretained, all that is necessary to be known is found within the space of\r\na year, and laws also admit of being kept within some given period.\r\n\r\nI shall here close this letter, so far as it respects the Addresses, the\r\nProclamation, and the Prosecution; and shall offer a few observations to\r\nthe Society, styling itself \"The Friends of the People.\"\r\n\r\nThat the science of government is beginning to be better understood than\r\nin former times, and that the age of fiction and political superstition,\r\nand of craft and mystery, is passing away, are matters which the\r\nexperience of every day-proves to be true, as well in England as in\r\nother countries.\r\n\r\nAs therefore it is impossible to calculate the silent progress of\r\nopinion, and also impossible to govern a nation after it has changed\r\nits habits of thinking, by the craft or policy that it was governed\r\nby before, the only true method to prevent popular discontents and\r\ncommotions is, to throw, by every fair and rational argument, all the\r\nlight upon the subject that can possibly be thrown; and at the same\r\ntime, to open the means of collecting the general sense of the nation;\r\nand this cannot, as already observed, be done by any plan so effectually\r\nas a national convention. Here individual opinion will quiet itself by\r\nhaving a centre to rest upon.\r\n\r\nThe society already mentioned, (which is made up of men of various\r\ndescriptions, but chiefly of those called Foxites,) appears to me,\r\neither to have taken wrong grounds from want of judgment, or to have\r\nacted with cunning reserve. It is now amusing the people with a\r\nnew phrase, namely, that of \"a temperate and moderate reform,\" the\r\ninterpretation of which is, _a continuance of the abuses as long as\r\npossible, If we cannot hold all let us hold some_.\r\n\r\nWho are those that are frightened at reforms? Are the public afraid that\r\ntheir taxes should be lessened too much? Are they afraid that sinecure\r\nplaces and pensions should be abolished too fast? Are the poor afraid\r\nthat their condition should be rendered too comfortable? Is the worn-out\r\nmechanic, or the aged and decayed tradesman, frightened at the prospect\r\nof receiving ten pounds a year out of the surplus taxes? Is the soldier\r\nfrightened at the thoughts of his discharge, and three shillings per\r\nweek during life? Is the sailor afraid that press-warrants will be\r\nabolished? The Society mistakes the fears of borough-mongers, placemen,\r\nand pensioners, for the fears of the people; and the _temperate and\r\nmoderate Reform_ it talks of, is calculated to suit the condition of the\r\nformer.\r\n\r\nThose words, \"temperate and moderate,\" are words either of political\r\ncowardice, or of cunning, or seduction.--A thing, moderately good, is\r\nnot so good as it ought to be. Moderation in temper, is always a virtue;\r\nbut moderation in principle, is a species of vice. But who is to be the\r\njudge of what is a temperate and moderate Reform? The Society is the\r\nrepresentative of nobody; neither can the unrepresented part of the\r\nnation commit this power to those in Parliament, in whose election they\r\nhad no choice; and, therefore, even upon the ground the Society has\r\ntaken, recourse must be had to a National Convention.\r\n\r\nThe objection which Mr. Fox made to Mr. Grey's proposed Motion for a\r\nParliamentary Reform was, that it contained no plan.--It certainly did\r\nnot. But the plan very easily presents itself; and whilst it is fair\r\nfor all parties, it prevents the dangers that might otherwise arise from\r\nprivate or popular discontent.\r\n\r\nThomas Paine.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Editorial Note on Burke's Alleged Secret Pension.--By\r\n     reference to Vol. II., pp. 271, 360, of this work, it will\r\n     be seen that Paine mentions a report that Burke was a\r\n     \"pensioner in a fictitious name.\" A letter of John Hall to a\r\n     relative in Leicester, (London, May 1,1792.) says: \"You will\r\n     remember that there was a vote carried, about the conclusion\r\n     of the American war, that the influence of the Crown had\r\n     increased, was increasing, and should be diminished. Burke,\r\n     poor, and like a good angler, baited a hook with a bill to\r\n     bring into Parliament, that no pensions should be given\r\n     above £300 a year, but what should be publicly granted, and\r\n     for what, (I may not be quite particular.) To stop that he\r\n     took in another person's name £1500 a year for life, and\r\n     some time past he disposed of it, or sold his life out. He\r\n     has been very still since his declension from the Whigs, and\r\n     is not concerned in the slave-trade [question?] as I hear\r\n     of.\" This letter, now in possession of Hall's kinsman, Dr.\r\n     Dutton Steele of Philadelphia, contains an item not in\r\n     Paine's account, which may have been derived from it. Hall\r\n     was an English scientific engineer, and acquainted with\r\n     intelligent men in London. Paine was rather eager for a\r\n     judicial encounter with Burke, and probably expected to be\r\n     sued by him for libel, as he (Burke) had once sued the\r\n     \"Public Advertiser\" for a personal accusation. But Burke\r\n     remained quiet under this charge, and Paine, outlawed, and\r\n     in France, had no opportunity for summoning witnesses in its\r\n     support. The biographers of Burke have silently passed over\r\n     the accusation, and this might be fair enough were this\r\n     unconfirmed charge made against a public man of stainless\r\n     reputation in such matters. But though Burke escaped\r\n     parliamentary censure for official corruption (May 16, 1783,\r\n     by only 24 majority) he has never been vindicated. It was\r\n     admitted that he had restored to office a cashier and an\r\n     accountant dismissed for dishonesty by his predecessor.\r\n     (\"Pari. Hist.,\" xxiii., pp. 801,902.) He escaped censure by\r\n     agreeing to suspend them.    One was proved guilty, the\r\n     other committed suicide. It was subsequently shown that one\r\n     of the men had been an agent of the Burkes in raising India\r\n     stock. (Dilke's \"Papers of a Critic,\" ii-, p. 333--\"Dict.\r\n     Nat Biography\": art Burke.) Paine, in his letter to the\r\n     Attorney-General (IV. of this volume), charged that Burke\r\n     had been a \"masked pensioner\" ten years. The date\r\n     corresponds with a secret arrangement made in 1782 with\r\n     Burke for a virtual pension to his son, for life, and his\r\n     mother. Under date April 34 of that year, Burke, writing to\r\n     William Burke at Madras, reports his appointment as\r\n     Paymaster: \"The office is to be 4000L. certain. Young\r\n     Richard [his son] is the deputy with a salary of 500L. The\r\n     office to be reformed according to the Bill. There is enough\r\n     emoluments. In decency it could not be more. Something\r\n     considerable is also to be secured for the life of young\r\n     Richard to be a security for him and his mother.\"(\"Mem. and\r\n     Cor. of Charles James Fox,\" i., p. 451.) It is thus certain\r\n     that the Rockingham Ministry were doing for the Paymaster\r\n     all they could \"in decency,\" and that while posing as a\r\n     reformer in reducing the expenses of that office, he was\r\n     arranging for secret advantages to his family. It is said\r\n     that the arrangement failed by his loss of office, but while\r\n     so many of Burke's papers are withheld from the public (if\r\n     not destroyed), it cannot be certain that something was not\r\n     done of the kind charged by Paine. That Burke was not strict\r\n     in such matters is further shown by his efforts to secure\r\n     for his son the rich sinecure of the Clerkship of the Polls,\r\n     in which he failed. Burke was again Paymaster in 1783-4, and\r\n     this time remained long enough in office to repeat more\r\n     successfully his secret attempts to secure irregular\r\n     pensions for his family. On April 7, 1894, Messrs. Sotheby,\r\n     Wilkinson, and Hodge sold in London (Lot 404) a letter of\r\n     Burke (which I have not seen in print), dated July 16, 1795.\r\n     It was written to the Chairman of the Commission on Public\r\n     Accounts, who had required him to render his accounts for\r\n     the time he was in office as Paymaster-General, 1783-4.\r\n     Burke refuses to do so in four angry and quibbling pages,\r\n     and declares he will appeal to his country against the\r\n     demand if it is pressed. Why should Burke wish to conceal\r\n     his accounts? There certainly were suspicions around Burke,\r\n     and they may have caused Pitt to renounce his intention,\r\n     conveyed to Burke, August 30, 1794, of asking Parliament to\r\n     bestow on him a pension. \"It is not exactly known,\" says one\r\n     of Burke's editors, \"what induced Mr. Pitt to decline\r\n     bringing before Parliament a measure which he had himself\r\n     proposed without any solicitation whatever on the part of\r\n     Burke.\" (Burke's \"Works,\" English Ed., 1852, ii., p. 252.)\r\n     The pensions were given without consultation with\r\n     Parliament--1200L. granted him by the King from the Civil\r\n     List, and 2500L. by Pitt in West Indian 41/2 per cents.\r\n     Burke, on taking his seat beside Pitt in the great Paine\r\n     Parliament (December, 1792), had protested that he had not\r\n     abandoned his party through expectation of a pension, but\r\n     the general belief of those with whom he had formerly acted\r\n     was that he had been promised a pension.   A couplet of the\r\n     time ran:\r\n\r\n     \"A pension makes him change his plan,\r\n     And loudly damn the rights of man.\"\r\n\r\n     Writing in 1819, Cobbett says: \"As my Lord Grenville\r\n     introduced the name of Burke, suffer me, my Lord, to\r\n     introduce the name of the man [Paine] who put this Burke to\r\n     shame, who drove him off the public stage to seek shelter in\r\n     the Pension List, and who is now named fifty million times\r\n     where the name of the pensioned Burke is mentioned once.\"--\r\n     _Editor._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX. ADDRESS TO THE PEOPLE OF FRANCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nParis, Sept. 25, [1792.] First Year of the Republic.\r\n\r\nFellow Citizens,\r\n\r\nI RECEIVE, with affectionate gratitude, the honour which the late\r\nNational Assembly has conferred upon me, by adopting me a Citizen of\r\nFrance: and the additional honor of being elected by my fellow citizens\r\na Member of the National Convention.(1) Happily impressed, as I am, by\r\nthose testimonies of respect shown towards me as an individual, I feel\r\nmy felicity increased by seeing the barrier broken down that divided\r\npatriotism by spots of earth, and limited citizenship to the soil, like\r\nvegetation.\r\n\r\nHad those honours been conferred in an hour of national tranquillity,\r\nthey would have afforded no other means of shewing my affection, than\r\nto have accepted and enjoyed them; but they come accompanied with\r\ncircumstances that give me the honourable opportunity of commencing\r\nmy citizenship in the stormy hour of difficulties. I come not to enjoy\r\nrepose. Convinced that the cause of France is the cause of all mankind,\r\nand that liberty cannot be purchased by a wish, I gladly share with you\r\nthe dangers and honours necessary to success.\r\n\r\n     1 The National Assembly (August 26, 1792) conferred the\r\n     title of \"French Citizen\" on \"Priestley, Payne, Bentham,\r\n     Wilberforce, Clarkson, Mackintosh, Campe, Cormelle, Paw,\r\n     David Williams, Gorani, Anacharsis Clootz, Pestalozzi,\r\n     Washington, Hamilton, Madison, Klopstoc, Kosciusko,\r\n     Gilleers.\"--_Editor._. vol ni--7\r\n\r\nI am well aware that the moment of any great change, such as that\r\naccomplished on the 10th of August, is unavoidably the moment of\r\nterror and confusion. The mind, highly agitated by hope, suspicion and\r\napprehension, continues without rest till the change be accomplished.\r\nBut let us now look calmly and confidently forward, and success is\r\ncertain. It is no longer the paltry cause of kings, or of this, or of\r\nthat individual, that calls France and her armies into action. It is the\r\ngreat cause of all. It is the establishment of a new aera, that shall\r\nblot despotism from the earth, and fix, on the lasting principles of\r\npeace and citizenship, the great Republic of Man.\r\n\r\nIt has been my fate to have borne a share in the commencement and\r\ncomplete establishment of one Revolution, (I mean the Revolution of\r\nAmerica.) The success and events of that Revolution are encouraging to\r\nus. The prosperity and happiness that have since flowed to that country,\r\nhave amply rewarded her for all the hardships she endured and for all\r\nthe dangers she encountered.\r\n\r\nThe principles on which that Revolution began, have extended themselves\r\nto Europe; and an over-ruling Providence is regenerating the Old World\r\nby the principles of the New. The distance of America from all the\r\nother parts of the globe, did not admit of her carrying those principles\r\nbeyond her own situation. It is to the peculiar honour of France, that\r\nshe now raises the standard of liberty for all nations; and in fighting\r\nher own battles, contends for the rights of all mankind.\r\n\r\nThe same spirit of fortitude that insured success to America; will\r\ninsure it to France, for it is impossible to conquer a nation determined\r\nto be free! The military circumstances that now unite themselves to\r\nFrance, are such as the despots of the earth know nothing of, and can\r\nform no calculation upon. They know not what it is to fight against a\r\nnation; they have only been accustomed to make war upon each other,\r\nand they know, from system and practice, how to calculate the probable\r\nsuccess of despot against despot; and here their knowledge and their\r\nexperience end.\r\n\r\nBut in a contest like the present a new and boundless variety of\r\ncircumstances arise, that deranges all such customary calculations. When\r\na whole nation acts as an army, the despot knows not the extent of the\r\npower against which he contends. New armies arise against him with the\r\nnecessity of the moment. It is then that the difficulties of an invading\r\nenemy multiply, as in the former case they diminished; and he finds them\r\nat their height when he expected them to end.\r\n\r\nThe only war that has any similarity of circumstances with the present,\r\nis the late revolution war in America. On her part, as it now is in\r\nFrance, it was a war of the whole nation:--there it was that the enemy,\r\nby beginning to conquer, put himself in a condition of being conquered.\r\nHis first victories prepared him for defeat. He advanced till he could\r\nnot retreat, and found himself in the midst of a nation of armies.\r\n\r\nWere it now to be proposed to the Austrians and Prussians, to escort\r\nthem into the middle of France, and there leave them to make the most\r\nof such a situation, they would see too much into the dangers of it to\r\naccept the offer, and the same dangers would attend them, could they\r\narrive there by any other means. Where, then, is the military policy of\r\ntheir attempting to obtain, by force, that which they would refuse by\r\nchoice? But to reason with despots is throwing reason away. The best of\r\narguments is a vigorous preparation.\r\n\r\nMan is ever a stranger to the ways by which Providence regulates the\r\norder of things. The interference of foreign despots may serve to\r\nintroduce into their own enslaved countries the principles they come\r\nto oppose. Liberty and Equality are blessings too great to be the\r\ninheritance of France alone. It is an honour to her to be their first\r\nchampion; and she may now say to her enemies, with a mighty voice, \"O!\r\nye Austrians, ye Prussians! ye who now turn your bayonets against us,\r\nit is for you, it is for all Europe, it is for all mankind, and not for\r\nFrance alone, that she raises the standard of Liberty and Equality!\"\r\n\r\nThe public cause has hitherto suffered from the contradictions contained\r\nin the Constitution of the Constituent Assembly. Those contradictions\r\nhave served to divide the opinions of individuals at home, and to\r\nobscure the great principles of the Revolution in other countries. But\r\nwhen those contradictions shall be removed, and the Constitution be\r\nmade conformable to the declaration of Rights; when the bagatelles of\r\nmonarchy, royalty, regency, and hereditary succession, shall be exposed,\r\nwith all their absurdities, a new ray of light will be thrown over the\r\nworld, and the Revolution will derive new strength by being universally\r\nunderstood.\r\n\r\nThe scene that now opens itself to France extends far beyond the\r\nboundaries of her own dominions. Every nation is becoming her colleague,\r\nand every court is become her enemy. It is now the cause of all nations,\r\nagainst the cause of all courts. The terror that despotism felt,\r\nclandestinely begot a confederation of despots; and their attack upon\r\nFrance was produced by their fears at home.\r\n\r\nIn entering on this great scene, greater than any nation has yet been\r\ncalled to act in, let us say to the agitated mind, be calm. Let us\r\npunish by instructing, rather than by revenge. Let us begin the new\r\nara by a greatness of friendship, and hail the approach of union and\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\nYour Fellow-Citizen,\r\n\r\nThomas Paine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI. ANTI-MONARCHAL ESSAY. FOR THE USE OF NEW REPUBLICANS.(1)\r\n\r\nWhen we reach some great good, long desired, we begin by felicitating\r\nourselves. We triumph, we give ourselves up to this joy without\r\nrendering to our minds any full account of our reasons for it. Then\r\ncomes reflexion: we pass in review all the circumstances of our new\r\nhappiness; we compare it in detail with our former condition; and\r\neach of these thoughts becomes a fresh enjoyment. This satisfaction,\r\nelucidated and well-considered, we now desire to procure for our\r\nreaders.\r\n\r\nIn seeing Royalty abolished and the Republic established, all France\r\nhas resounded with unanimous plaudits.(2) Yet, Citizen President: In the\r\nname of the Deputies of the Department of the Pas de Calais, I have the\r\nhonor of presenting to the Convention the felicitations of the General\r\nCouncil of the Commune of Calais on the abolition of Royalty.\r\n\r\n     1 Translated for this work from Le Patriote François,\r\n     \"Samedi 20 Octobre, 1793, l'an Ier de la République.\r\n     Supplement au No. 1167,\" in the Bibliothèque Nationale,\r\n     Paris. It is headed, \"Essai anti-monarchique, à l'usage des\r\n     nouveaux républicains, tiré de la Feuille Villageoise.\" I\r\n     have not found this Feuille, but no doubt Brissot, in\r\n     editing the essay for his journal (Le Patriote François)\r\n     abridged it, and in one instance Paine is mentioned by name.\r\n     Although in this essay Paine occasionally repeats sentences\r\n     used elsewhere, and naturally maintains his well-known\r\n     principles, the work has a peculiar interest as indicating\r\n     the temper and visions of the opening revolution.--_Editor._\r\n\r\n     2 Royalty was abolished by the National Convention on the\r\n     first day of its meeting, September 21, 1792, the\r\n     revolutionary Calendar beginning next day. Paine was chosen\r\n     by his fellow-deputies of Calais to congratulate the\r\n     Convention, and did so in a brief address, dated October 27,\r\n     which was loaned by M. Charavay to the Historical Exposition\r\n     of the Revolution at Paris, 1889, where I made the subjoined\r\n     translation: \"folly of oar ancestor», who have placed us\r\n     under the necessity of treating gravely (solennellement) the\r\n     abolition of a phantom (fantôme).--Thomas Paine, Deputy.\"--\r\n     _Editor._\r\n\r\nAmid the joy inspired by this event, one cannot forbear some pain\r\nat the some who clap their hands do not sufficiently understand the\r\ncondition they are leaving or that which they are assuming.\r\n\r\nThe perjuries of Louis, the conspiracies of his court, the wildness of\r\nhis worthy brothers, have filled every Frenchman with horror, and this\r\nrace was dethroned in their hearts before its fall by legal decree. But\r\nit is little to throw down an idol; it is the pedestal that above all\r\nmust be broken down; it is the regal office rather than the incumbent\r\nthat is murderous. All do not realize this.\r\n\r\nWhy is Royalty an absurd and detestable government? Why is the Republic\r\na government accordant with nature and reason? At the present time a\r\nFrenchman should put himself in a position to answer these two questions\r\nclearly. For, in fine, if you are free and contented it is yet needful\r\nthat you should know why.\r\n\r\nLet us first discuss Royalty or Monarchy. Although one often wishes to\r\ndistinguish between these names, common usage gives them the same sense.\r\n\r\n\r\nROYALTY.\r\n\r\nBands of brigands unite to subvert a country, place it under tribute,\r\nseize its lands, enslave its inhabitants. The expedition completed, the\r\nchieftain of the robbers adopts the title of monarch or king. Such\r\nis the origin of Royalty among all tribes--huntsmen, agriculturists,\r\nshepherds.\r\n\r\nA second brigand arrives who finds it equitable to take away by force\r\nwhat was conquered by violence: he dispossesses the first; he chains\r\nhim, kills him, reigns in his place. Ere long time effaces the memory\r\nof this origin; the successors rule under a new form; they do a little\r\ngood, from policy; they corrupt all who surround them; they invent\r\nfictitious genealogies to make their families sacred (1); the knavery\r\nof priests comes to their aid; they take Religion for a life-guard:\r\nthenceforth tyranny becomes immortal, the usurped power becomes an\r\nhereditary right.\r\n\r\n     1 The Boston Investigator's compilation of Paine's Works\r\n     contains the following as  supposed to be Mr. Paine's:\r\n\r\n     \"Royal Pedigree.--George the Third, who was the grandson of\r\n     George the Second, who was the son of George the First, who\r\n     was the son of the Princess Sophia, who was the cousin of\r\n     Anne, who was the sister of William and Mary, who were the\r\n     daughter and son-in-law of James the Second, who was the son\r\n     of Charles the First, who was a traitor to his country and\r\n     decapitated as such, who was the son of James the First, who\r\n     was the son of Mary, who was the sister of Edward the Sixth,\r\n     who was the son of Henry the Eighth, who was the coldblooded\r\n     murderer of his wives, and the promoter of the Protestant\r\n     religion, who was the son of Henry the Seventh, who slew\r\n     Richard the Third, who smothered his nephew Edward the\r\n     Fifth, who was the son of Edward the Fourth, who with bloody\r\n     Richard slew Henry the Sixth, who succeeded Henry the Fifth,\r\n     who was the son of Henry the Fourth, who was the cousin of\r\n     Richard the Second, who was the son of Edward the Third, who\r\n     was the son of Richard the Second, who was the son of Edward\r\n     the First, who was the son of Henry the Third, who was the\r\n     son of John, who was the brother of Richard the First, who\r\n     was the son of Henry the Second, who was the son of Matilda,\r\n     who was the daughter of Henry the First, who was the brother\r\n     of William Rufus, who was the son of William the Conqueror,\r\n     who was the son of a whore.\"--_Editor._\r\n\r\nThe effects of Royalty have been entirely harmonious with its origin.\r\nWhat scenes of horror, what refinements of iniquity, do the annals of\r\nmonarchies present! If we should paint human nature with a baseness of\r\nheart, an hypocrisy, from which all must recoil and humanity disavow, it\r\nwould be the portraiture of kings, their ministers and courtiers.\r\n\r\nAnd why should it not be so? What should such a monstrosity produce\r\nbut miseries and crimes? What is monarchy? It has been finely disguised,\r\nand the people familiarized with the odious title: in its real sense the\r\nword signifies _the absolute power of one single individual_, who may\r\nwith impunity be stupid, treacherous, tyrannical, etc. Is it not an\r\ninsult to nations to wish them so governed?\r\n\r\nGovernment by a single individual is vicious in itself, independently of\r\nthe individual's vices. For however little a State, the prince is\r\nnearly always too small: where is the proportion between one man and the\r\naffairs of a whole nation?\r\n\r\nTrue, some men of genius have been seen under the diadem; but the evil\r\nis then even greater: the ambition of such a man impels him to conquest\r\nand despotism, his subjects soon have to lament his glory, and sing\r\ntheir _Te-deums_ while perishing with hunger. Such is the history of\r\nLouis XIV. and so many others.\r\n\r\nBut if ordinary men in power repay you with incapacity or with princely\r\nvices? But those who come to the front in monarchies are frequently\r\nmere mean mischief-makers, commonplace knaves, petty intriguers, whose\r\nsmall wits, which in courts reach large places, serve only to display\r\ntheir ineptitude in public, as soon as they appear. (*) In short,\r\nmonarchs do nothing, and their ministers do evil: this is the history of\r\nall monarchies.\r\n\r\nBut if Royalty as such is baneful, as hereditary succession it is\r\nequally revolting and ridiculous. What! there exists among my kind a man\r\nwho pretends that he is born to govern me? Whence derived he such right?\r\nFrom his and my ancestors, says he. But how could they transmit to him\r\na right they did not possess? Man has no authority over generations\r\nunborn. I cannot be the slave of the dead, more than of the living.\r\nSuppose that instead of our posterity, it was we who should succeed\r\nourselves: we should not to-day be able to despoil ourselves of the\r\nrights which would belong to us in our second life: for a stronger\r\nreason we cannot so despoil others.\r\n\r\nAn hereditary crown! A transmissible throne! What a notion! With even a\r\nlittle reflexion, can any one tolerate it? Should human beings then be\r\nthe property of certain individuals, born or to be born? Are we then to\r\ntreat our descendants in advance as cattle, who shall have neither will\r\nnor rights of their own? To inherit government is to inherit peoples,\r\nas if they were herds. It is the basest, the most shameful fantasy that\r\never degraded mankind.\r\n\r\nIt is wrong to reproach kings with their ferocity, their brutal\r\nindifference, the oppressions of the people, and molestations of\r\ncitizens: it is hereditary succession that makes them what they are:\r\nthis breeds monsters as a marsh breeds vipers.\r\n\r\n     * J. J. Rousseau, Contrat Social.--Author.\r\n\r\nThe logic on which the hereditary prince rests is in effect this: I\r\nderive my power from my birth; I derive my birth from God; therefore\r\nI owe nothing to men. It is little that he has at hand a complacent\r\nminister, he continues to indulge, conscientiously, in all the crimes of\r\ntyranny. This has been seen in all times and countries.\r\n\r\nTell me, then, what is there in common between him who is master of a\r\npeople, and the people of whom he is master? Are these masters really of\r\ntheir kind? It is by sympathy that we are good and human: with whom does\r\na monarch sympathize? When my neighbor suffers I pity, because I put\r\nmyself in his place: a monarch pities none, because he has never been,\r\ncan never be, in any other place than his own.\r\n\r\nA monarch is an egoist by nature, the _egoist par excellence_. A\r\nthousand traits show that this kind of men have no point of contact with\r\nthe rest of humanity. There was demanded of Charles II. the punishment\r\nof Lauderdale, his favorite, who had infamously oppressed the Scotch.\r\n\"Yes,\" said Charles coolly, \"this man has done much against the Scotch,\r\nbut I cannot see that he has done anything against my interests.\" Louis\r\nXIV. often said: \"If I follow the wishes of the people, I cannot act the\r\nking.\" Even such phrases as \"misfortunes of the State,\" \"safety of the\r\nState,\" filled Louis XIV. with wrath.\r\n\r\nCould nature make a law which should assure virtue and wisdom invariably\r\nin these privileged castes that perpetuate themselves on thrones, there\r\nwould be no objection to their hereditary succession. But let us pass\r\nEurope in review: all of its monarchs are the meanest of men. This one\r\na tyrant, that one an imbecile, another a traitor, the next a debauchee,\r\nwhile some muster all the vices. It looks as if fate and nature had\r\naimed to show our epoch, and all nations, the absurdity and enormity of\r\nRoyalty.\r\n\r\nBut I mistake: this epoch has nothing peculiar. For, such is the\r\nessential vice of this royal succession by animal filiation, the peoples\r\nhave not even the chances of nature,--they cannot even hope for a good\r\nprince as an alternative. All things conspire to deprive of reason\r\nand justice an individual reared to command others. The word of young\r\nDionysius was very sensible: his father, reproaching him for a shameful\r\naction, said, \"Have I given thee such example?\" \"Ah,\" answered the\r\nyouth, \"thy father was not a king!\"\r\n\r\nIn truth, were laughter on such a subject permissible, nothing would\r\nsuggest ideas more burlesque than this fantastic institution of\r\nhereditary kings. Would it not be believed, to look at them, that there\r\nreally exist particular lineages possessing certain qualities which\r\nenter the blood of the embryo prince, and adapt him physically\r\nfor royalty, as a horse for the racecourse? But then, in this wild\r\nsupposition, it yet becomes necessary to assure the genuine family\r\ndescent of the heir presumptive. To perpetuate the noble race of\r\nAndalusian chargers, the circumstances pass before witnesses, and\r\nsimilar precautions seem necessary, however indecent, to make sure that\r\nthe trickeries of queens shall not supply thrones with bastards, and\r\nthat the kings, like the horses, shall always be thoroughbreds.\r\n\r\nWhether one jests or reasons, there is found in this idea of hereditary\r\nroyalty only folly and shame. What then is this office, which may be\r\nfilled by infants or idiots? Some talent is required to be a simple\r\nworkman; to be a king there is need to have only the human shape, to be\r\na living automaton. We are astonished when reading that the Egyptians\r\nplaced on the throne a flint, and called it their king. We smile at\r\nthe dog Barkouf, sent by an Asiatic despot to govern one of his\r\nprovinces.(*) But mon-archs of this kind are less mischievous and less\r\nabsurd than those before whom whole peoples prostrate themselves. The\r\nflint and the dog at least imposed on nobody. None ascribed to them\r\nqualities or characters they did not possess. They were not styled\r\n'Father of the People,'--though this were hardly more ridiculous than\r\nto give that title to a rattle-head whom inheritance crowns at eighteen.\r\nBetter a mute than an animate idol. Why, there can hardly be cited an\r\ninstance of a great man having children worthy of him, yet you will have\r\nthe royal function pass from father to son! As well declare that a wise\r\nman's son will be wise. A king is an administrator, and an hereditary\r\nadministrator is as absurd as an author by birthright.\r\n\r\n     * See the first year of La Feuille Villageoise, No. 42.--\r\n     Author. [Cf. Montaigne's Essays, chap. xii.--_Editor._]\r\n\r\nRoyalty is thus as contrary to common sense as to com-mon right. But it\r\nwould be a plague even if no more than an absurdity; for a people who\r\ncan bow down in honor of a silly thing is a debased people. Can they be\r\nfit for great affairs who render equal homage to vice and virtue, and\r\nyield the same submission to ignorance and wisdom? Of all institutions,\r\nnone has caused more intellectual degeneracy. This explains the\r\noften-remarked abjectness of character under monarchies.\r\n\r\nSuch is also the effect of this contagious institution that it renders\r\nequality impossible, and draws in its train the presumption and the\r\nevils of \"Nobility.\" If you admit inheritance of an office, why not that\r\nof a distinction? The Nobility's heritage asks only homage, that of\r\nthe Crown commands submission. When a man says to me, 'I am born\r\nillustrious,' I merely smile; when he says 'I am born your master,' I\r\nset my foot on him.\r\n\r\nWhen the Convention pronounced the abolition of Royalty none rose\r\nfor the defence that was expected. On this subject a philosopher, who\r\nthought discussion should always precede enactment, proposed a singular\r\nthing; he desired that the Convention should nominate an orator\r\ncommissioned to plead before it the cause of Royalty, so that the\r\npitiful arguments by which it has in all ages been justified might\r\nappear in broad daylight. Judges give one accused, however certain\r\nhis guilt, an official defender. In the ancient Senate of Venice there\r\nexisted a public officer whose function was to contest all propositions,\r\nhowever incontestible, or however perfect their evidence. For the rest,\r\npleaders for Royalty are not rare: let us open them, and see what the\r\nmost specious of royalist reasoners have said.\r\n\r\n1. _A king is necessary to preserve a people from the tyranny of\r\npowerful men_.\r\n\r\nEstablish the Rights of Man(1); enthrone Equality; form a good\r\nConstitution; divide well its powers; let there be no privileges, no\r\ndistinctions of birth, no monopolies; make safe the liberty of industry\r\nand of trade, the equal distribution of [family] inheritances, publicity\r\nof administration, freedom of the press: these things all established,\r\nyou will be assured of good laws, and need not fear the powerful men.\r\nWillingly or unwillingly, all citizens will be under the Law.\r\n\r\n     1 The reader should bear in mind that this phrase, now used\r\n     vaguely, had for Paine and his political school a special\r\n     significance; it implied a fundamental Declaration of\r\n     individual rights, of supreme force and authority, invasion\r\n     which, either by legislatures, law courts, majorities, or\r\n     administrators, was to be regarded as the worst treason and\r\n     despotism.--_Editor._\r\n\r\n2. _The Legislature might usurp authority, and a king is needed to\r\nrestrain it_.\r\n\r\nWith representatives, frequently renewed, who neither administer\r\nnor judge, whose functions are determined by the laws; with national\r\nconventions, with primary assemblies, which can be convoked any moment;\r\nwith a people knowing how to read, and how to defend itself; with good\r\njournals, guns, and pikes; a Legislature would have a good deal of\r\ntrouble in enjoying any months of tyranny. Let us not suppose an evil\r\nfor the sake of its remedy.\r\n\r\n3. _A king is needed to give force to executive power_.\r\n\r\nThis might be said while there existed nobles, a priesthood,\r\nparliaments, the privileged of every kind. But at present who can resist\r\nthe Law, which is the will of all, whose execution is the interest of\r\nall? On the contrary the existence of an hereditary prince inspires\r\nperpetual distrust among the friends of liberty; his authority is odious\r\nto them; in checking despotism they constantly obstruct the action of\r\ngovernment. Observe how feeble the executive power was found, after our\r\nrecent pretence of marrying Royalty with Liberty.\r\n\r\nTake note, for the rest, that those who talk in this way are men who\r\nbelieve that the King and the Executive Power are only one and the same\r\nthing: readers of _La Feuille Villageoise_ are more advanced.(*)\r\n\r\n     * See No. 50.--_Author_\r\n\r\nOthers use this bad reasoning: \"Were there no hereditary chief there\r\nwould be an elective chief: the citizens would side with this man or\r\nthat, and there would be a civil war at every election.\" In the first\r\nplace, it is certain that hereditary succession alone has produced\r\nthe civil wars of France and England; and that beyond this are the\r\npre-tended rights, of royal families which have twenty times drawn on\r\nthese nations the scourge of foreign wars. It is, in fine, the heredity\r\nof crowns that has caused the troubles of Regency, which Thomas Paine\r\ncalls Monarchy at nurse.\r\n\r\nBut above all it must be said, that if there be an elective chief, that\r\nchief will not be a king surrounded by courtiers, burdened with pomp,\r\ninflated by idolatries, and endowed with thirty millions of money; also,\r\nthat no citizen will be tempted to injure himself by placing another\r\ncitizen, his equal, for some years in an office without limited income\r\nand circumscribed power.\r\n\r\nIn a word, whoever demands a king demands an aristocracy, and thirty\r\nmillions of taxes. See why Franklin described Royalism as _a crime like\r\npoisoning_.\r\n\r\nRoyalty, its fanatical eclat, its superstitious idolatry, the delusive\r\nassumption of its necessity, all these fictions have been invented only\r\nto obtain from men excessive taxes and voluntary servitude. Royalty\r\nand Popery have had the same aim, have sustained themselves by the same\r\nartifices, and crumble under the same Light.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII. TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL, ON THE PROSECUTION AGAINST THE SECOND PART\r\nOF RIGHTS OF MAN.(1)\r\n\r\nParis, 11th of November, 1st Year of the Republic. [1792.]\r\n\r\nMr. Attorney General:\r\n\r\nSir,--As there can be no personal resentment between two strangers, I\r\nwrite this letter to you, as to a man against whom I have no animosity.\r\n\r\nYou have, as Attorney General, commenced a prosecution against me, as\r\nthe author of Rights of Man. Had not my duty, in consequence of my being\r\nelected a member of the National Convention of France, called me from\r\nEngland, I should have staid to have contested the injustice of\r\nthat prosecution; not upon my own account, for I cared not about the\r\nprosecution, but to have defended the principles I had advanced in the\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n     1 Read to the Jury by the Attorney General, Sir Archibald\r\n     Macdonald, at the trial of Paine, December 18, 1792, which\r\n     resulted in his outlawry.--_Editor._\r\n\r\nThe duty I am now engaged in is of too much importance to permit me to\r\ntrouble myself about your prosecution: when I have leisure, I shall have\r\nno objection to meet you on that ground; but, as I now stand, whether\r\nyou go on with the prosecution, or whether you do not, or whether you\r\nobtain a verdict, or not, is a matter of the most perfect indifference\r\nto me as an individual. If you obtain one, (which you are welcome to\r\nif you can get it,) it cannot affect me either in person, property, or\r\nreputation, otherwise than to increase the latter; and with respect to\r\nyourself, it is as consistent that you obtain a verdict against the Man\r\nin the Moon as against me; neither do I see how you can continue the\r\nprosecution against me as you would have done against one _your own\r\npeople, who_ had absented himself because he was prosecuted; what passed\r\nat Dover proves that my departure from England was no secret. (1)\r\n\r\nMy necessary absence from your country affords the opportunity of\r\nknowing whether the prosecution was intended against Thomas Paine, or\r\nagainst the Right of the People of England to investigate systems and\r\nprinciples of government; for as I cannot now be the object of the\r\nprosecution, the going on with the prosecution will shew that something\r\nelse was the object, and that something else can be no other than the\r\nPeople of England, for it is against _their Rights_, and not against\r\nme, that a verdict or sentence can operate, if it can operate at all.\r\nBe then so candid as to tell the Jury, (if you choose to continue the\r\nprocess,) whom it is you are prosecuting, and on whom it is that the\r\nverdict is to fall.(2)\r\n\r\nBut I have other reasons than those I have mentioned for writing you\r\nthis letter; and, however you may choose to interpret them, they proceed\r\nfrom a good heart. The time, Sir, is becoming too serious to play\r\nwith Court prosecutions, and sport with national rights. The terrible\r\nexamples that have taken place here, upon men who, less than a year ago,\r\nthought themselves as secure as any prosecuting Judge, Jury, or Attorney\r\nGeneral, now can in England, ought to have some weight with men in\r\nyour situation. That the government of England is as great, if not the\r\ngreatest, perfection of fraud and corruption that ever took place since\r\ngovernments began, is what you cannot be a stranger to, unless the\r\nconstant habit of seeing it has blinded your senses; but though you\r\nmay not chuse to see it, the people are seeing it very fast, and the\r\nprogress is beyond what you may chuse to believe. Is it possible that\r\nyou, or I, can believe, or that reason can make any other man believe,\r\nthat the capacity of such a man as Mr. Guelph, or any of his profligate\r\nsons, is necessary to the government of a nation? I speak to you as one\r\nman ought to speak to another; and I know also that I speak what other\r\npeople are beginning to think.\r\n\r\n     1 See Chapter VIII. of this volume.--_Editor._\r\n\r\n     2 In reading the letter in court the Attorney General said\r\n     at this point: \"Gentlemen, I certainly will comply with\r\n     this request. I am prosecuting both him and his work; and\r\n     if I succeed in this prosecution, he shall never return to\r\n     this country otherwise than _in vintulis_, for I will outlaw\r\n     him.\"--_Editor._\r\n\r\nThat you cannot obtain a verdict (and if you do, it will signify\r\nnothing) _without packing a Jury_, (and we _both_ know that such tricks\r\nare practised,) is what I have very good reason to believe, I have gone\r\ninto coffee-houses, and places where I was unknown, on purpose to learn\r\nthe currency of opinion, and I never yet saw any company of twelve men\r\nthat condemned the book; but I have often found a greater number than\r\ntwelve approving it, and this I think is _a fair way of collecting the\r\nnatural currency of opinion_. Do not then, Sir, be the instrument of\r\ndrawing twelve men into a situation that may be _injurious_ to them\r\nafterwards. I do not speak this from policy, but from benevolence; but\r\nif you chuse to go on with the process, I make it my request to you that\r\nyou will read this letter in Court, after which the Judge and the Jury\r\nmay do as they please. As I do not consider myself the object of the\r\nprosecution, neither can I be affected by the issue, one way or the\r\nother, I shall, though a foreigner in your country, subscribe as much\r\nmoney as any other man towards supporting the right of the nation\r\nagainst the prosecution; and it is for this purpose only that I shall do\r\nit.(1)\r\n\r\nThomas Paine.\r\n\r\nAs I have not time to copy letters, you will excuse the corrections.\r\n\r\n     1 In reading this letter at the trial the Attorney\r\n     interspersed comments. At the phrase, \"Mr. Guelph and his\r\n     profligate sons,\" he exclaimed: \"This passage is\r\n     contemptuous, scandalous, false, cruel. Why, gentlemen, is\r\n     Mr. Paine, in addition to the political doctrines he is\r\n     teaching us in this country, to teach us the morality and\r\n     religion of implacability? Is he to teach human creatures,\r\n     whose moments of existence depend upon the permission of a\r\n     Being, merciful, long-suffering, and of great goodness, that\r\n     those youthful errors from which even royalty is not\r\n     exempted, are to be treasured up in a vindictive memory, and\r\n     are to receive sentence of irremissible sin at His hands....\r\n     If giving me pain was his object he has that hellish\r\n     gratification.\" Erskine, Fame's counsel, protested in\r\n     advance against the reading of this letter (of which he had\r\n     heard), as containing matter likely to divert the Jury from\r\n     the subject of prosecution (the book). Lord Kenyon admitted\r\n     the letter.--_Editor._\r\n\r\nP. S. I intended, had I staid in England, to have published the\r\ninformation, with my remarks upon it, before the trial came on; but as\r\nI am otherwise engaged, I reserve myself till the trial is over, when I\r\nshall reply fully to every thing you shall advance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII. ON THE PROPRIETY OF BRINGING LOUIS XVI. TO TRIAL.(1)\r\n\r\nRead to the Convention, November 21, 1792.\r\n\r\nParis, Nov. 20, 1792.\r\n\r\nCitizen President,\r\n\r\nAs I do not know precisely what day the Convention will resume the\r\ndiscussion on the trial of Louis XVI., and, on account of my inability\r\nto express myself in French, I cannot speak at the tribune, I request\r\npermission to deposit in your hands the enclosed paper, which contains\r\nmy opinion on that subject. I make this demand with so much more\r\neagerness, because circumstances will prove how much it imports to\r\nFrance, that Louis XVI. should continue to enjoy good health. I should\r\nbe happy if the Convention would have the goodness to hear this paper\r\nread this morning, as I propose sending a copy of it to London, to be\r\nprinted in the English journals.(2)\r\n\r\nThomas Paine.\r\n\r\n     1 This address, which has suffered by alterations in all\r\n     editions is here revised and completed by aid of the\r\n     official document: \"Opinion de Thomas Payne, Depute du\r\n     Département de la Somme [error], concernant le jugement de\r\n     Louis XVI. Précédé par sa lettre d'envoi au Président de la\r\n     Convention. Imprimé par ordre de la Convention Nationale. À\r\n     Paris. De l'Imprimerie Nationale.\" Lamartine has censured\r\n     Paine for this speech; but the trial of the King was a\r\n     foregone conclusion, and it will be noted that Paine was\r\n     already trying to avert popular wrath from the individual\r\n     man by directing it against the general league of monarchs,\r\n     and the monarchal system. Nor would his plea for the King's\r\n     life have been listened to but for this previous address.--\r\n     _Editor._\r\n\r\n     2 Of course no English journal could then venture to print\r\n     it.--_Editor._\r\n\r\nA Secretary read the opinion of Thomas Paine. I think it necessary\r\nthat Louis XVI. should be tried; not that this advice is suggested by\r\na spirit of vengeance, but because this measure appears to me just,\r\nlawful, and conformable to sound policy. If Louis is innocent, let us\r\nput him to prove his innocence; if he is guilty, let the national will\r\ndetermine whether he shall be pardoned or punished.\r\n\r\nBut besides the motives personal to Louis XVI., there are others which\r\nmake his trial necessary. I am about to develope these motives, in the\r\nlanguage which I think expresses them, and no other. I forbid myself the\r\nuse of equivocal expression or of mere ceremony. There was formed among\r\nthe crowned brigands of Europe a conspiracy which threatened not only\r\nFrench liberty, but likewise that of all nations. Every thing tends\r\nto the belief that Louis XVI. was the partner of this horde of\r\nconspirators. You have this man in your power, and he is at present the\r\nonly one of the band of whom you can make sure. I consider Louis XVI. in\r\nthe same point of view as the two first robbers taken up in the affair\r\nof the Store Room; their trial led to discovery of the gang to which\r\nthey belonged. We have seen the unhappy soldiers of Austria, of Prussia,\r\nand the other powers which declared themselves our enemies, torn from\r\ntheir fire-sides, and drawn to butchery like wretched animals, to\r\nsustain, at the cost of their blood, the common cause of these crowned\r\nbrigands. They loaded the inhabitants of those regions with taxes to\r\nsupport the expenses of the war. All this was not done solely for Louis\r\nXVI. Some of the conspirators have acted openly: but there is reason\r\nto presume that this conspiracy is composed of two classes of brigands;\r\nthose who have taken up arms, and those who have lent to their cause\r\nsecret encouragement and clandestine assistance. Now it is indispensable\r\nto let France and the whole world know all these accomplices.\r\n\r\nA little time after the National Convention was constituted, the\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs presented the picture of all the\r\ngovernments of Europe,--those whose hostilities were public, and those\r\nthat acted with a mysterious circumspection. This picture supplied\r\ngrounds for just suspicions of the part the latter were disposed to\r\ntake, and since then various circumstances have occurred to confirm\r\nthose suspicions. We have already penetrated into some part of the\r\nconduct of Mr. Guelph, Elector of Hanover, and strong presumptions\r\ninvolve the same man, his court and ministers, in quality of king\r\nof England. M. Calonne has constantly been favoured with a friendly\r\nreception at that court.(1) The arrival of Mr. Smith, secretary to Mr.\r\nPitt, at Coblentz, when the emigrants were assembling there; the recall\r\nof the English ambassador; the extravagant joy manifested by the court\r\nof St. James' at the false report of the defeat of Dumouriez, when\r\nit was communicated by Lord Elgin, then Minister of Great Britain at\r\nBrussels--all these circumstances render him [George III.] extremely\r\nsuspicious; the trial of Louis XVI. will probably furnish more decisive\r\nproofs.\r\n\r\nThe long subsisting fear of a revolution in England, would alone, I\r\nbelieve, prevent that court from manifesting as much publicity in its\r\noperations as Austria and Prussia. Another reason could be added to\r\nthis: the inevitable decrease of credit, by means of which alone all\r\nthe old governments could obtain fresh loans, in proportion as the\r\nprobability of revolutions increased. Whoever invests in the new loans\r\nof such governments must expect to lose his stock.\r\n\r\nEvery body knows that the Landgrave of Hesse fights only as far as he is\r\npaid. He has been for many years in the pay of the court of London. If\r\nthe trial of Louis XVI. could bring it to light, that this detestable\r\ndealer in human flesh has been paid with the produce of the taxes\r\nimposed on the English people, it would be justice to that nation to\r\ndisclose that fact. It would at the same time give to France an exact\r\nknowledge of the character of that court, which has not ceased to be the\r\nmost intriguing in Europe, ever since its connexion with Germany.\r\n\r\n     1 Calonne (1734-1802), made Controller General of the\r\n     Treasury in 1783, lavished the public money on the Queen, on\r\n     courtiers, and on himself (purchasing St. Cloud and\r\n     Rambouillet), borrowing vast sums and deceiving the King as\r\n     to the emptiness of the Treasury, the annual deficit having\r\n     risen in 1787 to 115 millions of francs. He was then\r\n     banished to Lorraine, whence he proceeded to England, where\r\n     he married the wealthy widow Haveley. By his agency for the\r\n     Coblentz party he lost his fortune. In 1802 Napoleon brought\r\n     him back from London to Paris, where he died the same year.\r\n     --_Editor._\r\n\r\nLouis XVI., considered as an individual, is an object beneath the notice\r\nof the Republic; but when he is looked upon as a part of that band of\r\nconspirators, as an accused man whose trial may lead all nations in\r\nthe world to know and detest the disastrous system of monarchy, and the\r\nplots and intrigues of their own courts, he ought to be tried.\r\n\r\nIf the crimes for which Louis XVI. is arraigned were absolutely personal\r\nto him, without reference to general conspiracies, and confined to the\r\naffairs of France, the plea of inviolability, that folly of the moment,\r\nmight have been urged in his behalf with some appearance of reason; but\r\nhe is arraigned not only for treasons against France, but for having\r\nconspired against all Europe, and if France is to be just to all Europe\r\nwe ought to use every means in our power to discover the whole extent\r\nof that conspiracy. France is now a republic; she has completed her\r\nrevolution; but she cannot earn all its advantages so long as she is\r\nsurrounded with despotic governments. Their armies and their marine\r\noblige her also to keep troops and ships in readiness. It is therefore\r\nher immediate interest that all nations shall be as free as herself;\r\nthat revolutions shall be universal; and since the trial of Louis XVI.\r\ncan serve to prove to the world the flagitiousness of governments in\r\ngeneral, and the necessity of revolutions, she ought not to let slip so\r\nprecious an opportunity.\r\n\r\nThe despots of Europe have formed alliances to preserve their respective\r\nauthority, and to perpetuate the oppression of peoples. This is the end\r\nthey proposed to themselves in their invasion of French territory. They\r\ndread the effect of the French revolution in the bosom of their own\r\ncountries; and in hopes of preventing it, they are come to attempt\r\nthe destruction of this revolution before it should attain its perfect\r\nmaturity. Their attempt has not been attended with success. France has\r\nalready vanquished their armies; but it remains for her to sound the\r\nparticulars of the conspiracy, to discover, to expose to the eyes of\r\nthe world, those despots who had the infamy to take part in it; and the\r\nworld expects from her that act of justice.\r\n\r\nThese are my motives for demanding that Louis XVI. be judged; and it is\r\nin this sole point of view that his trial appears to me of sufficient\r\nimportance to receive the attention of the Republic.\r\n\r\nAs to \"inviolability,\" I would not have such a word mentioned. If,\r\nseeing in Louis XVI. only a weak and narrow-minded man, badly reared,\r\nlike all his kind, given, as it is said, to frequent excesses of\r\ndrunkenness--a man whom the National Assembly imprudently raised again\r\non a throne for which he was not made--he is shown hereafter some\r\ncompassion, it shall be the result of the national magnanimity, and not\r\nthe burlesque notion of a pretended \"inviolability.\"\r\n\r\nThomas Paine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV.  REASONS FOR PRESERVING THE LIFE OF LOUIS CAPET,\r\n\r\nAs Delivered to the National Convention, January 15, 1703.(1)\r\n\r\nCitizen President,\r\n\r\nMy hatred and abhorrence of monarchy are sufficiently known: they\r\noriginate in principles of reason and conviction, nor, except with life,\r\ncan they ever be extirpated; but my compassion for the unfortunate,\r\nwhether friend or enemy, is equally lively and sincere.\r\n\r\nI voted that Louis should be tried, because it was necessary to afford\r\nproofs to the world of the perfidy, corruption, and abomination of the\r\nmonarchical system. The infinity of evidence that has been produced\r\nexposes them in the most glaring and hideous colours; thence it results\r\nthat monarchy, whatever form it may assume, arbitrary or otherwise,\r\nbecomes necessarily a centre round which are united every species of\r\ncorruption, and the kingly trade is no less destructive of all morality\r\nin the human breast, than the trade of an executioner is destructive\r\nof its sensibility. I remember, during my residence in another country,\r\nthat I was exceedingly struck with a sentence of M. Autheine, at the\r\nJacobins [Club], which corresponds exactly with my own idea,--\"Make me a\r\nking to-day,\" said he, \"and I shall be a robber to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\n     1 Printed in Paris (Hartley, Adlard & Son) and published in\r\n     London with the addition of D. I. Eaton's name, in 1796.\r\n     While Paine was in prison, he was accused in England and\r\n     America of having helped to bring Louis XVI. to the\r\n     scaffold. The English pamphlet has a brief preface in which\r\n     it is presented \"as a burnt offering to Truth, in behalf of\r\n     the most zealous friend and advocate of the Rights of Man;\r\n     to protect him against the barbarous shafts of scandal and\r\n     delusion, and as a reply to all the horrors which despots of\r\n     every description have, with such unrelenting malice,\r\n     attempted to fix on his conduct. But truth in the end must\r\n     triumph: cease then such calumnies: all your efforts are\r\n     in vain --you bite a file.\"--_Editor._\r\n\r\nNevertheless, I am inclined to believe that if Louis Capet had been born\r\nin obscure condition, had he lived within the circle of an amiable and\r\nrespectable neighbourhood, at liberty to practice the duties of domestic\r\nlife, had he been thus situated, I cannot believe that he would have\r\nshewn himself destitute of social virtues: we are, in a moment of\r\nfermentation like this, naturally little indulgent to his vices, or\r\nrather to those of his government; we regard them with additional\r\nhorror and indignation; not that they are more heinous than those of\r\nhis predecessors, but because our eyes are now open, and the veil of\r\ndelusion at length withdrawn; yet the lamentable, degraded state to\r\nwhich he is actually reduced, is surely far less imputable to him\r\nthan to the Constituent Assembly, which, of its own authority, without\r\nconsent or advice of the people, restored him to the throne.\r\n\r\nI was in Paris at the time of the flight, or abdication of Louis XVI.,\r\nand when he was taken and brought back. The proposal of restoring him to\r\nsupreme power struck me with amazement; and although at that time I was\r\nnot a French citizen, yet as a citizen of the world I employed all the\r\nefforts that depended on me to prevent it.\r\n\r\nA small society, composed only of five persons, two of whom are\r\nnow members of the Convention,(1) took at that time the name of the\r\nRepublican Club (Société Républicaine). This society opposed the\r\nrestoration of Louis, not so much on account of his personal offences,\r\nas in order to overthrow the monarchy, and to erect on its ruins the\r\nrepublican system and an equal representation.\r\n\r\nWith this design, I traced out in the English language certain\r\npropositions, which were translated with some trifling alterations, and\r\nsigned by Achille Duchâtelet, now Lieutenant-General in the army of the\r\nFrench republic, and at that time one of the five members which composed\r\nour little party: the law requiring the signature of a citizen at the\r\nbottom of each printed paper.\r\n\r\n     1 Condorect and Paine; the other members were Achille\r\n     Duchitelet, and probably Nicolas de Bonneville and\r\n     Lanthenas,--translator of Paine's \"Works.\"--_Editor._\r\n\r\nThe paper was indignantly torn by Malouet; and brought forth in this\r\nvery room as an article of accusation against the person who had signed\r\nit, the author and their adherents; but such is the revolution of\r\nevents, that this paper is now received and brought forth for a very\r\nopposite purpose--to remind the nation of the errors of that unfortunate\r\nday, that fatal error of not having then banished Louis XVI. from its\r\nbosom, and to plead this day in favour of his exile, preferable to his\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nThe paper in question, was conceived in the following terms:\r\n\r\n[The address constitutes the first chapter of the present volume.]\r\n\r\nHaving thus explained the principles and the exertions of the\r\nrepublicans at that fatal period, when Louis was rein-stated in\r\nfull possession of the executive power which by his flight had been\r\nsuspended, I return to the subject, and to the deplorable situation in\r\nwhich the man is now actually involved.\r\n\r\nWhat was neglected at the time of which I have been speaking, has been\r\nsince brought about by the force of necessity. The wilful, treacherous\r\ndefects in the former constitution have been brought to light; the\r\ncontinual alarm of treason and conspiracy aroused the nation, and\r\nproduced eventually a second revolution. The people have beat down\r\nroyalty, never, never to rise again; they have brought Louis Capet to\r\nthe bar, and demonstrated in the face of the whole world, the intrigues,\r\nthe cabals, the falsehood, corruption, and rooted depravity, the\r\ninevitable effects of monarchical government. There remains then only\r\none question to be considered, what is to be done with this man?\r\n\r\nFor myself I seriously confess, that when I reflect on the unaccountable\r\nfolly that restored the executive power to his hands, all covered as\r\nhe was with perjuries and treason, I am far more ready to condemn the\r\nConstituent Assembly than the unfortunate prisoner Louis Capet.\r\n\r\nBut abstracted from every other consideration, there is one circumstance\r\nin his life which ought to cover or at least to palliate a great number\r\nof his transgressions, and this very circumstance affords to the French\r\nnation a blessed occasion of extricating itself from the yoke of kings,\r\nwithout defiling itself in the impurities of their blood.\r\n\r\nIt is to France alone, I know, that the United States of America owe\r\nthat support which enabled them to shake off the unjust and tyrannical\r\nyoke of Britain. The ardour and zeal which she displayed to provide both\r\nmen and money, were the natural consequence of a thirst for liberty.\r\nBut as the nation at that time, restrained by the shackles of her own\r\ngovernment, could only act by the means of a monarchical organ, this\r\norgan--whatever in other respects the object might be--certainly\r\nperformed a good, a great action.\r\n\r\nLet then those United States be the safeguard and asylum of Louis Capet.\r\nThere, hereafter, far removed from the miseries and crimes of royalty,\r\nhe may learn, from the constant aspect of public prosperity, that the\r\ntrue system of government consists not in kings, but in fair, equal, and\r\nhonourable representation.\r\n\r\nIn relating this circumstance, and in submitting this proposition, I\r\nconsider myself as a citizen of both countries. I submit it as a citizen\r\nof America, who feels the debt of gratitude which he owes to every\r\nFrenchman. I submit it also as a man, who, although the enemy of kings,\r\ncannot forget that they are subject to human frailties. I support my\r\nproposition as a citizen of the French republic, because it appears to\r\nme the best, the most politic measure that can be adopted.\r\n\r\nAs far as my experience in public life extends, I have ever observed,\r\nthat the great mass of the people are invariably just, both in their\r\nintentions and in their objects; but the true method of accomplishing an\r\neffect does not always shew itself in the first instance. For example:\r\nthe English nation had groaned under the despotism of the Stuarts.\r\nHence Charles I. lost his life; yet Charles II. was restored to all\r\nthe plenitude of power, which his father had lost. Forty years had\r\nnot expired when the same family strove to reestablish their ancient\r\noppression; so the nation then banished from its territories the whole\r\nrace. The remedy was effectual. The Stuart family sank into obscurity,\r\nconfounded itself with the multitude, and is at length extinct.\r\n\r\nThe French nation has carried her measures of government to a greater\r\nlength. France is not satisfied with exposing the guilt of the monarch.\r\nShe has penetrated into the vices and horrors of the monarchy. She has\r\nshown them clear as daylight, and forever crushed that system; and he,\r\nwhoever he may be, that should ever dare to reclaim those rights would\r\nbe regarded not as a pretender, but punished as a traitor.\r\n\r\nTwo brothers of Louis Capet have banished themselves from the country;\r\nbut they are obliged to comply with the spirit and etiquette of the\r\ncourts where they reside. They can advance no pretensions on their own\r\naccount, so long as Louis Capet shall live.\r\n\r\nMonarchy, in France, was a system pregnant with crime and murders,\r\ncancelling all natural ties, even those by which brothers are united. We\r\nknow how often they have assassinated each other to pave a way to power.\r\nAs those hopes which the emigrants had reposed in Louis XVI. are fled,\r\nthe last that remains rests upon his death, and their situation inclines\r\nthem to desire this catastrophe, that they may once again rally around\r\na more active chief, and try one further effort under the fortune of\r\nthe ci-devant Monsieur and d'Artois. That such an enterprize would\r\nprecipitate them into a new abyss of calamity and disgrace, it is not\r\ndifficult to foresee; yet it might be attended with mutual loss, and it\r\nis our duty as legislators not to spill a drop of blood when our purpose\r\nmay be effectually accomplished without it.\r\n\r\nIt has already been proposed to abolish the punishment of death, and it\r\nis with infinite satisfaction that I recollect the humane and excellent\r\noration pronounced by Robespierre on that subject in the Constituent\r\nAssembly. This cause must find its advocates in every corner where\r\nenlightened politicians and lovers of humanity exist, and it ought above\r\nall to find them in this assembly.\r\n\r\nMonarchical governments have trained the human race, and inured it to\r\nthe sanguinary arts and refinements of punishment; and it is exactly the\r\nsame punishment which has so long shocked the sight and tormented\r\nthe patience of the people, that now, in their turn, they practice in\r\nrevenge upon their oppressors. But it becomes us to be strictly on our\r\nguard against the abomination and perversity of monarchical examples:\r\nas France has been the first of European nations to abolish royalty, let\r\nher also be the first to abolish the punishment of death, and to find\r\nout a milder and more effectual substitute.\r\n\r\nIn the particular case now under consideration, I submit the following\r\npropositions: 1st, That the National Convention shall pronounce sentence\r\nof banishment on Louis and his family. 2d, That Louis Capet shall\r\nbe detained in prison till the end of the war, and at that epoch the\r\nsentence of banishment to be executed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXV. SHALL LOUIS XVI. HAVE RESPITE?\r\n\r\nSPEECH IN THE CONVENTION, JANUARY 19, 1793.(1)\r\n\r\n(Read in French by Deputy Bancal,)\r\n\r\nVery sincerely do I regret the Convention's vote of yesterday for death.\r\n\r\nMarat [_interrupting_]: I submit that Thomas Paine is incompetent to\r\nvote on this question; being a Quaker his religious principles are\r\nopposed to capital punishment. [_Much confusion, quieted by cries for\r\n\"freedom of speech\" on which Bancal proceeds with Paine's speech_.]\r\n\r\n     1 Not included in any previous edition of Paine's \"Works.\"\r\n     It is here printed from contemporary French reports,\r\n     modified only by Paine's own quotations of a few sentences\r\n     in his Memorial to Monroe (xxi.).--_Editor._\r\n\r\nI have the advantage of some experience; it is near twenty years that I\r\nhave been engaged in the cause of liberty, having contributed something\r\nto it in the revolution of the United States of America, My language has\r\nalways been that of liberty _and_ humanity, and I know that nothing\r\nso exalts a nation as the union of these two principles, under all\r\ncircumstances. I know that the public mind of France, and particularly\r\nthat of Paris, has been heated and irritated by the dangers to which\r\nthey have been exposed; but could we carry our thoughts into the future,\r\nwhen the dangers are ended and the irritations forgotten, what\r\nto-day seems an act of justice may then appear an act of vengeance.\r\n[_Murmurs_.] My anxiety for the cause of France has become for the\r\nmoment concern for her honor. If, on my return to America, I should\r\nemploy myself on a history of the French Revolution, I had rather record\r\na thousand errors on the side of mercy, than be obliged to tell one act\r\nof severe justice. I voted against an appeal to the people, because it\r\nappeared to me that the Convention was needlessly wearied on that point;\r\nbut I so voted in the hope that this Assembly would pronounce against\r\ndeath, and for the same punishment that the nation would have voted,\r\nat least in my opinion, that is for reclusion during the war, and\r\nbanishment thereafter.(1) That is the punishment most efficacious,\r\nbecause it includes the whole family at once, and none other can so\r\noperate. I am still against the appeal to the primary assemblies,\r\nbecause there is a better method. This Convention has been elected to\r\nform a Constitution, which will be submitted to the primary assemblies.\r\nAfter its acceptance a necessary consequence will be an election and\r\nanother assembly. We cannot suppose that the present Convention will\r\nlast more than five or six months. The choice of new deputies will\r\nexpress the national opinion, on the propriety or impropriety of your\r\nsentence, with as much efficacy as if those primary assemblies had been\r\nconsulted on it. As the duration of our functions here cannot be long,\r\nit is a part of our duty to consider the interests of those who shall\r\nreplace us. If by any act of ours the number of the nation's enemies\r\nshall be needlessly increased, and that of its friends diminished,--at a\r\ntime when the finances may be more strained than to-day,--we should\r\nnot be justifiable for having thus unnecessarily heaped obstacles in\r\nthe path of our successors. Let us therefore not be precipitate in our\r\ndecisions.\r\n\r\n     1 It is possible that the course of the debate may have\r\n     produced some reaction among the people, but when Paine\r\n     voted against submitting the king's fate to the popular vote\r\n     it was believed by the king and his friends that it would be\r\n     fatal. The American Minister, Gouverneur Morris, who had\r\n     long been acting for the king, wrote to President\r\n     Washington, Jan. 6, 1793: \"The king's fate is to be decided\r\n     next Monday, the 14th. That unhappy man, conversing with one\r\n     of his Council on his own fate, calmly summed up the motives\r\n     of every kind, and concluded that a majority of the Council\r\n     would vote for referring his case to the people, and that in\r\n     consequence he should be massacred.\" Writing to Washington\r\n     on Dec. 28, 1792, Morris mentions having heard from Paine\r\n     that he was to move the king's banishment to America, and he\r\n     may then have informed Paine that the king believed\r\n     reference of his case to popular vote would be fatal.\r\n     Genet was to have conducted the royal family to America.--\r\n     _Editor._\r\n\r\nFrance has but one ally--the United States of America. That is the only\r\nnation that can furnish France with naval provisions, for the\r\nkingdoms of northern Europe are, or soon will be, at war with her. It\r\nunfortunately happens that the person now under discussion is considered\r\nby the Americans as having been the friend of their revolution. His\r\nexecution will be an affliction to them, and it is in your power not\r\nto wound the feelings of your ally. Could I speak the French language I\r\nwould descend to your bar, and in their name become your petitioner to\r\nrespite the execution of the sentence on Louis.\r\n\r\nThuriot: This is not the language of Thomas Paine.\r\n\r\nMarat: I denounce the interpreter. I maintain that it is not Thomas\r\nPaine's opinion. It is an untrue translation.\r\n\r\nGarran: I have read the original, and the translation is correct.(1)\r\n\r\n[_Prolonged uproar. Paine, still standing in the tribune beside his\r\ninterpreter, Deputy Bancal, declared the sentiments to be his._]\r\n\r\nYour Executive Committee will nominate an ambassador to Philadelphia;\r\nmy sincere wish is that he may announce to America that the National\r\nConvention of France, out of pure friendship to America, has consented\r\nto respite Louis. That people, by my vote, ask you to delay the\r\nexecution.\r\n\r\nAh, citizens, give not the tyrant of England the triumph of seeing the\r\nman perish on the scaffold who had aided my much-loved America to break\r\nhis chains!\r\n\r\nMarat [\"_launching himself into the middle of the hall_\"]: Paine voted\r\nagainst the punishment of death because he is a Quaker.\r\n\r\nPaine: I voted against it from both moral motives and motives of public\r\npolicy.\r\n\r\n     1 See Guizot, \"Hist, of France,\" vi., p. 136. \"Hist.\r\n     Parliamentair,\" vol. ii., p. 350. Louis Blanc says that\r\n     Paine's appeal was so effective that Marat interrupted\r\n     mainly in order to destroy its effect.--\"Hist, de la Rev.,\"\r\n     tome vii, 396.--_Editor._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI. DECLARATION OF RIGHTS.(1)\r\n\r\nThe object of all union of men in society being maintenance of their\r\nnatural rights, civil and political, these rights are the basis of the\r\nsocial pact: their recognition and their declaration ought to precede\r\nthe Constitution which assures their guarantee.\r\n\r\n1. The natural rights of men, civil and political, are liberty,\r\nequality, security, property, social protection, and resistance to\r\noppression.\r\n\r\n2. Liberty consists in the right to do whatever is not contrary to\r\nthe rights of others: thus, exercise of the natural rights of each\r\nindividual has no limits other than those which secure to other members\r\nof society enjoyment of the same rights.\r\n\r\n     1 In his appeal from prison to the Convention (August 7,\r\n     1794) Paine states that he had, as a member of the Committee\r\n     for framing the Constitution, prepared a Plan, which was in\r\n     the hands of Barère, also of that Committee. I have not yet\r\n     succeeded in finding Paine's Constitution, but it is certain\r\n     that the work of framing the Constitution of 1793 was mainly\r\n     entrusted to Paine and Condorcet.\r\n\r\n     Dr. John Moore, in his work on the French Revolution,\r\n     describes the two at their work; and it is asserted that he\r\n     \"assisted in drawing up the French Declaration of Rights,\"\r\n     by \"Juvencus,\" author of an able \"Essay on the Life and\r\n     Genius of Thomas Paine,\" whose information came from a\r\n     personal friend of Paine. (\"Aphorisms, Opinions, and\r\n     Reflections of Thomas Paine,\" etc., London, 1826. Pp. 3,\r\n     14.) A translation of the Declaration and Constitution\r\n     appeared in England (Debrett, Picadilly, 1793), but with\r\n     some faults. The present translation is from \"Oeuvres\r\n     Complètes de Condorcet,\" tome xviii. The Committee reported\r\n     their Constitution February 15th, and April 15th was set for\r\n     its discussion, Robespierre then demanded separate\r\n     discussion of the Declaration of Rights, to which he\r\n     objected that it made no mention of the Supreme Being, and\r\n     that its extreme principles of freedom would shield illicit\r\n     traffic. Paine and Jefferson were troubled that the United\r\n     States Constitution contained no Declaration of Rights, it\r\n     being a fundamental principle in Paine's theory of\r\n     government that such a Declaration was the main safeguard of\r\n     the individual against the despotism of numbers.    See\r\n     supra, vol. ii.t pp. 138, 139.--_Editor._.\r\n\r\n3. The preservation of liberty depends on submission to the Law, which\r\nis the expression of the general will. Nothing unforbidden by law can be\r\nhindered, and none may be forced to do what the law does not command.\r\n\r\n4. Every man is free to make known his thoughts and opinions.\r\n\r\n5. Freedom of the press, and every other means of publishing one's\r\nopinion, cannot be interdicted, suspended, or limited.\r\n\r\n6. Every citizen shall be free in the exercise of his religion\r\n(_culte_).\r\n\r\n7. Equality consists in the enjoyment by every one of the same rights.\r\n\r\n8. The law should be equal for all, whether it rewards or punishes,\r\nprotects or represses.\r\n\r\n9. All citizens are admissible to all public positions, employments, and\r\nfunctions. Free nations recognize no grounds of preference save talents\r\nand virtues.\r\n\r\n10. Security consists in the protection accorded by society to every\r\ncitizen for the preservation of his person, property, and rights.\r\n\r\n11. None should be sued, accused, arrested, or detained, save in cases\r\ndetermined by the law, and in accordance with forms prescribed by it.\r\nEvery other act against a citizen is arbitrary and null.\r\n\r\n12. Those who solicit, further, sign, execute, or cause to be executed,\r\nsuch arbitrary acts are culpable, and should be punished.\r\n\r\n13. Citizens against whom the execution of such acts is attempted\r\nhave the right to repel force by force; but every citizen summoned or\r\narrested by authority of the Law, and in the forms by it prescribed,\r\nshould instantly obey: he renders himself guilty by resistance.\r\n\r\n14. Every man being presumed innocent until legally pronounced guilty,\r\nshould his arrest be deemed indispensable, all rigor not necessary to\r\nsecure his person should be severely represssed by law.\r\n\r\n15. None should be punished save in virtue of a law formally enacted,\r\npromulgated anterior to the offence, and legally applied.\r\n\r\n16. Any law that should punish offences committed before its existence\r\nwould be an arbitrary act. Retroactive effect given to the law is a\r\ncrime.\r\n\r\n17. The law should award only penalties strictly and evidently necessary\r\nto the general safety. Penalties should be proportioned to offences, and\r\nuseful to society.\r\n\r\n18. The right of property consists in every man's being master in the\r\ndisposal, at his will, of his goods, capital, income, and industry.\r\n\r\n19. No kind of labor, commerce, or culture, can be prohibited to any\r\none: he may make, sell, and transport every species of production.\r\n\r\n20. Every man may engage his services and his time; but he cannot sell\r\nhimself; his person is not an alienable property.\r\n\r\n21. No one can be deprived of the least portion of his property without\r\nhis consent, unless evidently required by public necessity, legally\r\ndetermined, and under the condition of a just indemnity in advance.\r\n\r\n22. No tax shall be imposed except for the general welfare, and to meet\r\npublic needs. All citizens have the right to unite personally, or by\r\ntheir representatives, in the fixing of imposts.\r\n\r\n23. Instruction is the need of all, and society owes it to all its\r\nmembers equally.\r\n\r\n24. Public succours are a sacred debt of society; it is for the law to\r\ndetermine their extent and application.\r\n\r\n25. The social guarantee of the rights of man rests on the national\r\nsovereignty.\r\n\r\n26. This sovereignty is one, indivisible, imprescriptible, and\r\ninalienable.\r\n\r\n27. It resides essentially in the whole people, and every citizen has an\r\nequal right to unite in its exercise.\r\n\r\n28. No partial assemblage of citizens, and no individual, may attribute\r\nto themselves sovereignty, or exercise any authority, or discharge any\r\npublic function, without formal delegation thereto by the law.\r\n\r\n29. The social guarantee cannot exist if the limits of public\r\nadministration are not clearly determined by law, and if the\r\nresponsibility of all public functionaries is not assured.\r\n\r\n30. All citizens are bound to unite in this guarantee, and in enforcing\r\nthe law when summoned in its name.\r\n\r\n31. Men united in society should have legal means of resisting\r\noppression.\r\n\r\n32. There is oppression when any law violates the natural rights, civil\r\nand political, which it should guarantee.\r\n\r\nThere is oppression when the law is violated by public officials in its\r\napplication to individual cases.\r\n\r\nThere is oppression when arbitrary actions violate the rights of citizen\r\nagainst the express purpose (_expression_) of the law.\r\n\r\nIn a free government the mode of resisting these different acts of\r\noppression should be regulated by the Constitution.\r\n\r\n33. A people possesses always the right to reform and alter its\r\nConstitution. A generation has no right to subject a future generation\r\nto its laws; and all heredity in offices is absurd and tyrannical.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVII. PRIVATE LETTERS TO JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nParis, 20 April, 1793.\r\n\r\nMy dear Friend,--The gentleman (Dr. Romer) to whom I entrust this\r\nletter is an intimate acquaintance of Lavater; but I have not had the\r\nopportunity of seeing him, as he had set off for Havre prior to my\r\nwriting this letter, which I forward to him under cover from one of his\r\nfriends, who is also an acquaintance of mine.\r\n\r\nWe are now in an extraordinary crisis, and it is not altogether without\r\nsome considerable faults here. Dumouriez, partly from having no fixed\r\nprinciples of his own, and partly from the continual persecution of the\r\nJacobins, who act without either prudence or morality, has gone off\r\nto the Enemy, and taken a considerable part of the Army with him. The\r\nexpedition to Holland has totally failed, and all Brabant is again in\r\nthe hands of the Austrians.\r\n\r\nYou may suppose the consternation which such a sudden reverse of fortune\r\nhas occasioned, but it has been without commotion. Dumouriez threatened\r\nto be in Paris in three weeks. It is now three weeks ago; he is still on\r\nthe frontier near to Mons with the Enemy, who do not make any progress.\r\nDumouriez has proposed to re-establish the former Constitution in\r\nwhich plan the Austrians act with him. But if France and the National\r\nConvention act prudently this project will not succeed. In the first\r\nplace there is a popular disposition against it, and there is force\r\nsufficient to prevent it. In the next place, a great deal is to be taken\r\ninto the calculation with respect to the Enemy. There are now so many\r\npersons accidentally jumbled together as to render it exceedingly\r\ndifficult to them to agree upon any common object.\r\n\r\nThe first object, that of restoring the old Monarchy, is evidently given\r\nup by the proposal to re-establish the late Constitution. The object of\r\nEngland and Prussia was to preserve Holland, and the object of Austria\r\nwas to recover Brabant; while those separate objects lasted, each party\r\nhaving one, the Confederation could hold together, each helping the\r\nother; but after this I see not how a common object is to be formed.\r\nTo all this is to be added the probable disputes about opportunity,\r\nthe expence, and the projects of reimbursements. The Enemy has once\r\nadventured into France, and they had the permission or the good fortune\r\nto get back again. On every military calculation it is a hazardous\r\nadventure, and armies are not much disposed to try a second time the\r\nground upon which they have been defeated.\r\n\r\nHad this revolution been conducted consistently with its principles,\r\nthere was once a good prospect of extending liberty through the greatest\r\npart of Europe; but I now relinquish that hope. Should the Enemy by\r\nventuring into France put themselves again in a condition of being\r\ncaptured, the hope will revive; but this is a risk I do not wish to see\r\ntried, lest it should fail.\r\n\r\nAs the prospect of a general freedom is now much shortened, I begin\r\nto contemplate returning home. I shall await the event of the proposed\r\nConstitution, and then take my final leave of Europe. I have not written\r\nto the President, as I have nothing to communicate more than in this\r\nletter. Please to present him my affection and compliments, and remember\r\nme among the circle of my friends.\r\n\r\nYour sincere and affectionate friend,\r\n\r\nThomas Paine.\r\n\r\nP. S. I just now received a letter from General Lewis Morris, who tells\r\nme that the house and Barn on my farm at New Rochelle are burnt down. I\r\nassure you I shall not bring money enough to build another.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParis, 20 Oct., 1793.\r\n\r\nI wrote you by Captain Dominick who was to sail from Havre about the\r\n20th of this month. This will probably be brought you by Mr. Barlow or\r\nCol. Oswald. Since my letter by Dominick I am every day more convinced\r\nand impressed with the propriety of Congress sending Commissioners to\r\nEurope to confer with the Ministers of the Jesuitical Powers on the\r\nmeans of terminating the War. The enclosed printed paper will shew there\r\nare a variety of subjects to be taken into consideration which did not\r\nappear at first, all of which have some tendency to put an end to the\r\nWar. I see not how this War is to terminate if some intermediate power\r\ndoes not step forward. There is now no prospect that France can carry\r\nrevolutions into Europe on the one hand, or that the combined powers can\r\nconquer France on the other hand. It is a sort of defensive War on both\r\nsides. This being the case, how is the War to close? Neither side\r\nwill ask for peace though each may wish it. I believe that England\r\nand Holland are tired of the War. Their Commerce and Manufactures have\r\nsuffered most exceedingly,--besides this, it is for them a War without\r\nan object. Russia keeps herself at a distance.\r\n\r\nI cannot help repeating my wish that Congress would send Commissioners,\r\nand I wish also that yourself would venture once more across the ocean,\r\nas one of them. If the Commissioners rendezvous at Holland they would\r\nknow what steps to take. They could call Mr. Pinckney [Gen. Thomas\r\nPinckney, American Minister in England] to their councils, and it would\r\nbe of use, on many accounts, that one of them should come over from\r\nHolland to France. Perhaps a long truce, were it proposed by the neutral\r\npowers, would have all the effects of a Peace, without the difficulties\r\nattending the adjustment of all the forms of Peace.\r\n\r\nYours affectionately,\r\n\r\nThomas Paine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVIII. LETTER TO DANTON.(1)\r\n\r\nParis, May 6, 2nd year of the Republic [1793.]\r\n\r\nCitoyen Danton: As you read English, I write this letter to you without\r\npassing it through the hands of a translator. I am exceedingly disturbed\r\nat the distractions, jealousies, discontents and uneasiness that reign\r\namong us, and which, if they continue, will bring ruin and disgrace on\r\nthe Republic. When I left America in the year 1787, it was my intention\r\nto return the year following, but the French Revolution, and the\r\nprospect it afforded of extending the principles of liberty and\r\nfraternity through the greater part of Europe, have induced me to\r\nprolong my stay upwards of six years. I now despair of seeing the great\r\nobject of European liberty accomplished, and my despair arises not from\r\nthe combined foreign powers, not from the intrigues of aristocracy and\r\npriestcraft, but from the tumultuous misconduct with which the internal\r\naffairs of the present revolution are conducted.\r\n\r\nAll that now can be hoped for is limited to France only, and I agree\r\nwith your motion of not interfering in the government of any foreign\r\ncountry, nor permitting any foreign country to interfere in the\r\ngovernment of France. This decree was necessary as a preliminary toward\r\nterminating the war. But while these internal contentions continue,\r\nwhile the hope remains to the enemy of seeing the Republic fall to\r\npieces, while not only the representatives of the departments but\r\nrepresentation itself is publicly insulted, as it has lately been and\r\nnow is by the people of Paris, or at least by the tribunes, the enemy\r\nwill be encouraged to hang about the frontiers and await the issue of\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\n     1 This admirable letter was brought to light by the late M.\r\n     Taine, and first published in full by Taine's translator,\r\n     John Durand (\"New Materials for the History of the American\r\n     Revolution,\" 1889). The letter to Marat mentioned by Paine\r\n     has not been discovered. Danton followed Paine to prison,\r\n     and on meeting him there said: \"That which you did for the\r\n     happiness and liberty of your country I tried to do for\r\n     mine. I have been less fortunate, but not less innocent.\r\n     They will send me to the scaffold; very well, my friend, I\r\n     will go gaily.\" M. Taine in La Révolution (vol. ii., pp.\r\n     382, 413, 414) refers to this letter of Paine, and says:\r\n     \"Compared with the speeches and writings of the time, it\r\n     produces the strangest effect by its practical good sense.\"\r\n     --_Editor._,\r\n\r\nI observe that the confederated powers have not yet recognized Monsieur,\r\nor D'Artois, as regent, nor made any proclamation in favour of any\r\nof the Bourbons; but this negative conduct admits of two different\r\nconclusions. The one is that of abandoning the Bourbons and the war\r\ntogether; the other is that of changing the object of the war and\r\nsubstituting a partition scheme in the place of their first object, as\r\nthey have done by Poland. If this should be their object, the internal\r\ncontentions that now rage will favour that object far more than it\r\nfavoured their former object. The danger every day increases of a\r\nrupture between Paris and the departments. The departments did not send\r\ntheir deputies to Paris to be insulted, and every insult shown to them\r\nis an insult to the departments that elected and sent them. I see but\r\none effectual plan to prevent this rupture taking place, and that is to\r\nfix the residence of the Convention, and of the future assemblies, at a\r\ndistance from Paris.\r\n\r\nI saw, during the American Revolution, the exceeding inconvenience that\r\narose by having the government of Congress within the limits of any\r\nMunicipal Jurisdiction. Congress first resided in Philadelphia, and\r\nafter a residence of four years it found it necessary to leave it. It\r\nthen adjourned to the State of Jersey. It afterwards removed to\r\nNew York; it again removed from New York to Philadelphia, and after\r\nexperiencing in every one of these places the great inconvenience of\r\na government, it formed the project of building a Town, not within\r\nthe limits of any municipal jurisdiction, for the future residence of\r\nCongress. In any one of the places where Congress resided, the municipal\r\nauthority privately or openly opposed itself to the authority of\r\nCongress, and the people of each of these places expected more attention\r\nfrom Congress than their equal share with the other States amounted to.\r\nThe same thing now takes place in France, but in a far greater excess.\r\n\r\nI see also another embarrassing circumstance arising in Paris of which\r\nwe have had full experience in America. I mean that of fixing the price\r\nof provisions. But if this measure is to be attempted it ought to\r\nbe done by the Municipality. The Convention has nothing to do with\r\nregulations of this kind; neither can they be carried into practice. The\r\npeople of Paris may say they will not give more than a certain price\r\nfor provisions, but as they cannot compel the country people to bring\r\nprovisions to market the consequence will be directly contrary to their\r\nexpectations, and they will find dearness and famine instead of plenty\r\nand cheapness. They may force the price down upon the stock in hand, but\r\nafter that the market will be empty.\r\n\r\nI will give you an example. In Philadelphia we undertook, among other\r\nregulations of this kind, to regulate the price of Salt; the consequence\r\nwas that no Salt was brought to market, and the price rose to thirty-six\r\nshillings sterling per Bushel. The price before the war was only one\r\nshilling and sixpence per Bushel; and we regulated the price of flour\r\n(farina) till there was none in the market, and the people were glad to\r\nprocure it at any price.\r\n\r\nThere is also a circumstance to be taken into the account which is not\r\nmuch attended to. The assignats are not of the same value they were a\r\nyear ago, and as the quantity increases the value of them will diminish.\r\nThis gives the appearance of things being dear when they are not so in\r\nfact, for in the same proportion that any kind of money falls in\r\nvalue articles rise in price. If it were not for this the quantity of\r\nassignats would be too great to be circulated. Paper money in America\r\nfell so much in value from this excessive quantity of it, that in the\r\nyear 1781 I gave three hundred paper dollars for one pair of worsted\r\nstockings. What I write you upon this subject is experience, and not\r\nmerely opinion. I have no personal interest in any of these matters, nor\r\nin any party disputes. I attend only to general principles.\r\n\r\nAs soon as a constitution shall be established I shall return to\r\nAmerica; and be the future prosperity of France ever so great, I shall\r\nenjoy no other part of it than the happiness of knowing it. In the mean\r\ntime I am distressed to see matters so badly conducted, and so little\r\nattention paid to moral principles. It is these things that injure the\r\ncharacter of the Revolution and discourage the progress of liberty all\r\nover the world. When I began this letter I did not intend making it so\r\nlengthy, but since I have gone thus far I will fill up the remainder of\r\nthe sheet with such matters as occur to me.\r\n\r\nThere ought to be some regulation with respect to the spirit of\r\ndenunciation that now prevails. If every individual is to indulge his\r\nprivate malignancy or his private ambition, to denounce at random and\r\nwithout any kind of proof, all confidence will be undermined and all\r\nauthority be destroyed. Calumny is a species of Treachery that ought to\r\nbe punished as well as any other kind of Treachery. It is a private vice\r\nproductive of public evils; because it is possible to irritate men into\r\ndisaffection by continual calumny who never intended to be disaffected.\r\nIt is therefore, equally as necessary to guard against the evils\r\nof unfounded or malignant suspicion as against the evils of blind\r\nconfidence. It is equally as necessary to protect the characters of\r\npublic officers from calumny as it is to punish them for treachery or\r\nmisconduct. For my own part I shall hold it a matter of doubt, until\r\nbetter evidence arises than is known at present, whether Dumouriez has\r\nbeen a traitor from policy or resentment. There was certainly a time\r\nwhen he acted well, but it is not every man whose mind is strong enough\r\nto bear up against ingratitude, and I think he experienced a great deal\r\nof this before he revolted. Calumny becomes harmless and defeats itself,\r\nwhen it attempts to act upon too large a scale. Thus the denunciation\r\nof the Sections [of Paris] against the twenty-two deputies [Girondists]\r\nfalls to the ground. The departments that elected them are better judges\r\nof their moral and political characters than those who have denounced\r\nthem. This denunciation will injure Paris in the opinion of the\r\ndepartments because it has the appearance of dictating to them what sort\r\nof deputies they shall elect. Most of the acquaintances that I have in\r\nthe Convention are among those who are in that list, and I know there\r\nare not better men nor better patriots than what they are.\r\n\r\nI have written a letter to Marat of the same date as this but not on the\r\nsame subject. He may show it to you if he chuse.\r\n\r\nVotre Ami,\r\n\r\nThomas Paine.\r\n\r\nCitoyen Danton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIX. A CITIZEN OF AMERICA TO THE CITIZENS OF EUROPE (1)\r\n\r\n\r\n18th Year of Independence.\r\n\r\n     1 State Archives, Paris: États Unis, vol. 38, fol. 90. This\r\n     pamphlet is in English, without indication of authorship or\r\n     of the place of publication. It is accompanied by a French\r\n     translation (MS.) inscribed \"Par Thomas Payne.\" In the\r\n     printed pamphlet the date (18th Year, etc) is preceded by\r\n     the French words (printed): \"Philadelphie 28 Juillet 1793.\"\r\n     It was no doubt the pamphlet sent by Paine to Monroe, with\r\n     various documents relating to his imprisonment, describing\r\n     it as \"a Letter which I had printed here as an American\r\n     letter, some copies of which I sent to Mr. Jefferson.\" A\r\n     considerable portion of the pamphlet embodies, with\r\n     occasional changes of phraseology, a manuscript (États Unis,\r\n     vol. 37, Do. 39) endorsed: \"January 1793. Thorn. Payne.\r\n     Copie. Observations on the situation of the Powers joined\r\n     against France.\" This opens with the following paragraph:\r\n     \"It is always useful to know the position and the designs of\r\n     one's enemies. It is much easier to do so by combining and\r\n     comparing the events, and by examining the consequences\r\n     which result from them, than by forming one's judgment by\r\n     letters found or intercepted. These letters could be\r\n     fabricated with the intention of deceiving, but events or\r\n     circumstances have a character which is proper to them. If\r\n     in the course of our political operations we mistake the\r\n     designs of our enemy, it leads us to do precisely that which\r\n     he desires we should do, and it happens by the fact, but\r\n     against our intentions, that we work for him.\" That the date\r\n     written on this MS. is erroneous appears by an allusion to\r\n     the defeat of the Duke of York at Dunkirk in the closing\r\n     paragraph: \"There are three distinct parties in England at\r\n     this moment: the government party, the revolutionary party,\r\n     and an intermedial party,--which is only opposed to the war\r\n     on account of the expense it entails, and the harm it does\r\n     commerce and manufactures. I am speaking of the People, and\r\n     not of the Parliament. The latter is divided into two\r\n     parties: the Ministerial, and the Anti-ministerial. The\r\n     revolutionary party, the intermedial party, and the anti-\r\n     ministerial party, will all rejoice, publicly or privately,\r\n     at the defeat of the Duke of York at Dunkirk.\"   The two\r\n     paragraphs quoted represent the only actual additions to the\r\n     pamphlet. I have a clipping from the London Morning\r\n     Chronicle of Friday, April 25, 1794, containing the part of\r\n     the pamphlet headed \"Of the present state of Europe and the\r\n     Confederacy,\" signed \"Thomas Paine, Author of Common Sense,\r\n     etc.\" On February 1,1793, the Convention having declared\r\n     war, appointed Paine, Barère, Condorcet and Faber, a\r\n     Committee to draft an address to the English people. It was\r\n     never done, but these fragments may represent notes written\r\n     by Paine with reference to that task.   The pamphlet\r\n     probably appeared late in September, 1793.--_Editor._,\r\n\r\n\r\nUnderstanding that a proposal is intended to be made at the ensuing\r\nmeeting of the Congress of the United States of America \"to send\r\ncommissioners to Europe to confer with the Ministers of all the Neutral\r\nPowers for the purpose of negotiating preliminaries of peace,\" I address\r\nthis letter to you on that subject, and on the several matters connected\r\ntherewith.\r\n\r\nIn order to discuss this subject through all its circumstances, it\r\nwill be necessary to take a review of the state of Europe, prior to the\r\nFrench revolution. It will from thence appear, that the powers leagued\r\nagainst France are fighting to attain an object, which, were it possible\r\nto be attained, would be injurious to themselves.\r\n\r\nThis is not an uncommon error in the history of wars and governments, of\r\nwhich the conduct of the English government in the war against America\r\nis a striking instance. She commenced that war for the avowed purpose of\r\nsubjugating America; and after wasting upwards of one hundred millions\r\nsterling, and then abandoning the object, she discovered, in the course\r\nof three or four years, that the prosperity of England was increased,\r\ninstead of being diminished, by the independence of America. In short,\r\nevery circumstance is pregnant with some natural effect, upon which\r\nintentions and opinions have no influence; and the political error\r\nlies in misjudging what the effect will be. England misjudged it in\r\nthe American war, and the reasons I shall now offer will shew, that she\r\nmisjudges it in the present war. In discussing this subject, I leave out\r\nof the question everything respecting forms and systems of government;\r\nfor as all the governments of Europe differ from each other, there is no\r\nreason that the government of France should not differ from the rest.\r\n\r\nThe clamours continually raised in all the countries of Europe were,\r\nthat the family of the Bourbons was become too powerful; that the\r\nintrigues of the court of France endangered the peace of Europe. Austria\r\nsaw with a jealous eye the connection of France with Prussia; and\r\nPrussia, in her turn became jealous of the connection of France with\r\nAustria; England had wasted millions unsuccessfully in attempting to\r\nprevent the family compact with Spain; Russia disliked the alliance\r\nbetween France and Turkey; and Turkey became apprehensive of the\r\ninclination of France towards an alliance with Russia. Sometimes the\r\nquadruple alliance alarmed some of the powers, and at other times a\r\ncontrary system alarmed others, and in all those cases the charge was\r\nalways made against the intrigues of the Bourbons.\r\n\r\nAdmitting those matters to be true, the only thing that could have\r\nquieted the apprehensions of all those powers with respect to the\r\ninterference of France, would have been her entire NEUTRALITY in Europe;\r\nbut this was impossible to be obtained, or if obtained was impossible\r\nto be secured, because the genius of her government was repugnant to all\r\nsuch restrictions.\r\n\r\nIt now happens that by entirely changing the genius of her government,\r\nwhich France has done for herself, this neutrality, which neither wars\r\ncould accomplish nor treaties secure, arises naturally of itself, and\r\nbecomes the ground upon which the war should terminate. It is the\r\nthing that approaches the nearest of all others to what ought to be the\r\npolitical views of all the European powers; and there is nothing that\r\ncan so effectually secure this neutrality, as that the genius of the\r\nFrench government should be different from the rest of Europe.\r\n\r\nBut if their object is to restore the Bourbons and monarchy together,\r\nthey will unavoidably restore with it all the evils of which they have\r\ncomplained; and the first question of discord will be, whose ally is\r\nthat monarchy to be?\r\n\r\nWill England agree to the restoration of the family compact against\r\nwhich she has been fighting and scheming ever since it existed? Will\r\nPrussia agree to restore the alliance between France and Austria, or\r\nwill Austria agree to restore the former connection between France and\r\nPrussia, formed on purpose to oppose herself; or will Spain or Russia,\r\nor any of the maritime powers, agree that France and her navy should be\r\nallied to England? In fine, will any of the powers agree to strengthen\r\nthe hands of the other against itself? Yet all these cases involve\r\nthemselves in the original question of the restoration of the Bourbons;\r\nand on the other hand, all of them disappear by the neutrality of\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\nIf their object is not to restore the Bourbons, it must be the\r\nimpracticable project of a partition of the country. The Bourbons will\r\nthen be out of the question, or, more properly speaking, they will be\r\nput in a worse condition; for as the preservation of the Bourbons made\r\na part of the first object, the extirpation of them makes a part of the\r\nsecond. Their pretended friends will then become interested in their\r\ndestruction, because it is favourable to the purpose of partition that\r\nnone of the nominal claimants should be left in existence.\r\n\r\nBut however the project of a partition may at first blind the eyes of\r\nthe confederacy, or however each of them may hope to outwit the other\r\nin the progress or in the end, the embarrassments that will arise are\r\ninsurmountable. But even were the object attainable, it would not be of\r\nsuch general advantage to the parties as the neutrality of France, which\r\ncosts them nothing, and to obtain which they would formerly have gone to\r\nwar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE PRESENT STATE OF EUROPE, AND THE CONFEDERACY.\r\n\r\nIn the first place the confederacy is not of that kind that forms\r\nitself originally by concert and consent. It has been forced together by\r\nchance--a heterogeneous mass, held only by the accident of the moment;\r\nand the instant that accident ceases to operate, the parties will retire\r\nto their former rivalships.\r\n\r\nI will now, independently of the impracticability of a partition\r\nproject, trace out some of the embarrassments which will arise among the\r\nconfederated parties; for it is contrary to the interest of a majority\r\nof them that such a project should succeed.\r\n\r\nTo understand this part of the subject it is necessary, in the\r\nfirst place, to cast an eye over the map of Europe, and observe the\r\ngeographical situation of the several parts of the confederacy; for\r\nhowever strongly the passionate politics of the moment may operate, the\r\npolitics that arise from geographical situation are the most certain,\r\nand will in all cases finally prevail.\r\n\r\nThe world has been long amused with what is called the \"_balance of\r\npower_.\" But it is not upon armies only that this balance depends.\r\nArmies have but a small circle of action. Their progress is slow and\r\nlimited. But when we take maritime power into the calculation, the scale\r\nextends universally. It comprehends all the interests connected with\r\ncommerce.\r\n\r\nThe two great maritime powers are England and France. Destroy either of\r\nthose, and the balance of naval power is destroyed. The whole world of\r\ncommerce that passes on the Ocean would then lie at the mercy of the\r\nother, and the ports of any nation in Europe might be blocked up.\r\n\r\nThe geographical situation of those two maritime powers comes next under\r\nconsideration. Each of them occupies one entire side of the channel from\r\nthe straits of Dover and Calais to the opening into the Atlantic. The\r\ncommerce of all the northern nations, from Holland to Russia, must pass\r\nthe straits of Dover and Calais, and along the Channel, to arrive at the\r\nAtlantic.\r\n\r\nThis being the case, the systematical politics of all the nations,\r\nnorthward of the straits of Dover and Calais, can be ascertained from\r\ntheir geographical situation; for it is necessary to the safety of their\r\ncommerce that the two sides of the Channel, either in whole or in part,\r\nshould not be in the possession either of England or France. While one\r\nnation possesses the whole of one side, and the other nation the other\r\nside, the northern nations cannot help seeing that in any situation of\r\nthings their commerce will always find protection on one side or the\r\nother. It may sometimes be that of England and sometimes that of France.\r\n\r\nAgain, while the English navy continues in its present condition, it is\r\nnecessary that another navy should exist to controul the universal sway\r\nthe former would otherwise have over the commerce of all nations. France\r\nis the only nation in Europe where this balance can be placed. The\r\nnavies of the North, were they sufficiently powerful, could not be\r\nsufficiently operative. They are blocked up by the ice six months in the\r\nyear. Spain lies too remote; besides which, it is only for the sake of\r\nher American mines that she keeps up her navy.\r\n\r\nApplying these cases to the project of a partition of France, it will\r\nappear, that the project involves with it a DESTRUCTION OF THE BALANCE\r\nOF MARITIME POWER; because it is only by keeping France entire and\r\nindivisible that the balance can be kept up. This is a case that at\r\nfirst sight lies remote and almost hidden. But it interests all the\r\nmaritime and commercial nations in Europe in as great a degree as any\r\ncase that has ever come before them.--In short, it is with war as it\r\nis with law. In law, the first merits of the case become lost in the\r\nmultitude of arguments; and in war they become lost in the variety of\r\nevents. New objects arise that take the lead of all that went before,\r\nand everything assumes a new aspect. This was the case in the last great\r\nconfederacy in what is called the succession war, and most probably will\r\nbe the case in the present.\r\n\r\nI have now thrown together such thoughts as occurred to me on the\r\nseveral subjects connected with the confederacy against France, and\r\ninterwoven with the interest of the neutral powers. Should a conference\r\nof the neutral powers take place, these observations will, at least,\r\nserve to generate others. The whole matter will then undergo a more\r\nextensive investigation than it is in my power to give; and the evils\r\nattending upon either of the projects, that of restoring the Bourbons,\r\nor of attempting a partition of France, will have the calm opportunity\r\nof being fully discussed.\r\n\r\nOn the part of England, it is very extraordinary that she should have\r\nengaged in a former confederacy, and a long expensive war, to _prevent_\r\nthe family compact, and now engage in another confederacy to _preserve_\r\nit. And on the part of the other powers, it is as inconsistent that they\r\nshould engage in a partition project, which, could it be executed, would\r\nimmediately destroy the balance of maritime power in Europe, and would\r\nprobably produce a second war, to remedy the political errors of the\r\nfirst.\r\n\r\nA Citizen of the United States of America.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXX. APPEAL TO THE CONVENTION.(1)\r\n\r\n\r\nCitizens Representatives: If I should not express myself with the energy\r\nI used formerly to do, you will attribute it to the very dangerous\r\nillness I have suffered in the prison of the Luxembourg. For several\r\ndays I was insensible of my own existence; and though I am much\r\nrecovered, it is with exceeding great difficulty that I find power to\r\nwrite you this letter.\r\n\r\n     1 Written in Luxembourg prison, August 7, 1794. Robespierre\r\n     having fallen July 29th, those who had been imprisoned under\r\n     his authority were nearly all at once released, but Paine\r\n     remained. There were still three conspirators against him on\r\n     the Committee of Public Safety, and to that Committee this\r\n     appeal was unfortunately confided; consequently it never\r\n     reached the Convention. The circumstances are related at\r\n     length infra, in the introduction to the Memorial to Monroe\r\n     (XXI.). It will also be seen that Paine was mistaken in his\r\n     belief that his imprisonment was due to the enmity of\r\n     Robespierre, and this he vaguely suspected when his\r\n     imprisonment was prolonged three months after Robespierre's\r\n     death.--_Editor._.\r\n\r\nBut before I proceed further, I request the Convention to observe: that\r\nthis is the first line that has come from me, either to the Convention\r\nor to any of the Committees, since my imprisonment,--which is\r\napproaching to eight months. --Ah, my friends, eight months' loss of\r\nliberty seems almost a life-time to a man who has been, as I have been,\r\nthe unceasing defender of Liberty for twenty years.\r\n\r\nI have now to inform the Convention of the reason of my not having\r\nwritten before. It is a year ago that I had strong reason to believe\r\nthat Robespierre was my inveterate enemy, as he was the enemy of every\r\nman of virtue and humanity. The address that was sent to the Convention\r\nsome time about last August from Arras, the native town of Robespierre,\r\nI have always been informed was the work of that hypocrite and the\r\npartizans he had in the place. The intention of that address was to\r\nprepare the way for destroying me, by making the people declare (though\r\nwithout assigning any reason) that I had lost their confidence; the\r\nAddress, however, failed of success, as it was immediately opposed by a\r\ncounter-address from St. Omer, which declared the direct contrary. But\r\nthe strange power that Robespierre, by the most consummate hypocrisy and\r\nthe most hardened cruelties, had obtained, rendered any attempt on my\r\npart to obtain justice not only useless but dangerous; for it is the\r\nnature of Tyranny always to strike a deeper blow when any attempt has\r\nbeen made to repel a former one. This being my situation, I submitted\r\nwith patience to the hardness of my fate and waited the event of\r\nbrighter days. I hope they are now arrived to the nation and to me.\r\n\r\nCitizens, when I left the United States in the year 1787 I promised to\r\nall my friends that I would return to them the next year; but the hope\r\nof seeing a revolution happily established in France, that might serve\r\nas a model to the rest of Europe,(1) and the earnest and disinterested\r\ndesire of rendering every service in my power to promote it, induced me\r\nto defer my return to that country, and to the society of my friends,\r\nfor more than seven years. This long sacrifice of private tranquillity,\r\nespecially after having gone through the fatigues and dangers of the\r\nAmerican Revolution which continued almost eight years, deserved a\r\nbetter fate than the long imprisonment I have silently suffered. But it\r\nis not the nation but a faction that has done me this injustice. Parties\r\nand Factions, various and numerous as they have been, I have always\r\navoided. My heart was devoted to all France, and the object to which I\r\napplied myself was the Constitution. The Plan which I proposed to the\r\nCommittee, of which I was a member, is now in the hands of Barère, and\r\nit will speak for itself.\r\n\r\n     1 Revolutions have now acquired such sanguinary associations\r\n     that it is important to bear in mind that by \"revolution\"\r\n     Paine always means simply a change or reformation of\r\n     government, which might be and ought to be bloodless. See\r\n     \"Rights of Man\" Part II., vol. ii. of this work, pp. 513,\r\n     523.--:_Editor_.\r\n\r\nIt is perhaps proper that I inform you of the cause as-assigned in the\r\norder for my imprisonment. It is that I am 'a Foreigner'; whereas, the\r\n_Foreigner_ thus imprisoned was invited into France by a decree of the\r\nlate National Assembly, and that in the hour of her greatest danger,\r\nwhen invaded by Austrians and Prussians. He was, moreover, a citizen of\r\nthe United States of America, an ally of France, and not a subject of\r\nany country in Europe, and consequently not within the intentions of any\r\ndecree concerning Foreigners. But any excuse can be made to serve the\r\npurpose of malignity when in power.\r\n\r\nI will not intrude on your time by offering any apology for the broken\r\nand imperfect manner in which I have expressed myself. I request you to\r\naccept it with the sincerity with which it comes from my heart; and I\r\nconclude with wishing Fraternity and prosperity to France, and union and\r\nhappiness to her representatives.\r\n\r\nCitizens, I have now stated to you my situation, and I can have no doubt\r\nbut your justice will restore me to the Liberty of which I have been\r\ndeprived.\r\n\r\nThomas Paine.\r\n\r\nLuxembourg, Thermidor 19, 2nd Year of the French Republic, one and\r\nindivisible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXI. THE MEMORIAL TO MONROE.\r\n\r\nEDITOR'S historical introduction:\r\n\r\nThe Memorial is here printed from the manuscript of Paine now among the\r\nMorrison Papers, in the British Museum,--no doubt the identical document\r\npenned in Luxembourg prison. The paper in the United States State\r\nDepartment (vol. vii., Monroe Papers) is accompanied by a note by\r\nMonroe: \"Mr. Paine, Luxembourg, on my arrival in France, 1794. My answer\r\nwas after the receipt of his second letter. It is thought necessary to\r\nprint only those parts of his that relate directly to his confinement,\r\nand to omit all between the parentheses in each.\" The paper thus\r\ninscribed seems to have been a wrapper for all of Paine's letters.\r\nAn examination of the MS. at Washington does not show any such\r\n\"parentheses,\" indicating omissions, whereas that in the British Museum\r\nhas such marks, and has evidently been prepared for the press,--being\r\nindeed accompanied by the long title of the French pamphlet. There are\r\nother indications that the British Museum MS. is the original Memorial\r\nfrom which was printed in Paris the pamphlet entitled:\r\n\r\n\"Mémoire de Thomas Payne, autographe et signé de sa main: addressé à\r\nM. Monroe, ministre des États-unis en france, pour réclamer sa mise en\r\nliberté comme citoyen Américain, 10 Sept 1794. Robespierre avait fait\r\narrêter Th. Payne, en 1793--il fut conduit au Luxembourg où le glaive\r\nfut longtemps suspendu sur sa tête. Après onze mois de captivité, il\r\nrecouvra la liberté, sur la réclamation du ministre Américain--c'était\r\naprès la chute de Robespierre--il reprit sa place à la convention, le 8\r\ndécembre 1794. (18 frimaire an iii.) Ce Mémoire contient des renseigne\r\nmens curieux sur la conduite politique de Th. Payne en france, pendant\r\nla Révolution, et à l'époque du procès de Louis XVI. Ce n'est point, dit\r\nil, comme Quaker, qu'il ne vota pas La Mort du Roi mais par un sentiment\r\nd'humanité, qui ne tenait point à ses principes religieux. Villenave.\"\r\n\r\nNo date is given, but the pamphlet probably appeared early in 1795.\r\nMatthieu Gillaume Thérèse Villenave (b. 1762, d. 1846) was a journalist,\r\nand it will be noticed that he, or the translator, modifies Paine's\r\nanswer to Marat about his Quakerism. There are some loose translations\r\nin the cheap French pamphlet, but it is the only publication which\r\nhas given Paine's Memorial with any fulness. Nearly ten pages of\r\nthe manuscript were omitted from the Memorial when it appeared as\r\nan Appendix to the pamphlet entitled \"Letter to George Washington,\r\nPresident of the United States of America, on Affairs public and\r\nprivate.\" By Thomas Paine, Author of the Works entitled, Common Sense,\r\nRights of Man, Age of Reason, &c. Philadelphia: Printed by Benj.\r\nFranklin Bache, No. 112 Market Street. 1796. [Entered according to\r\nlaw.] This much-abridged copy of the Memorial has been followed in\r\nall subsequent editions, so that the real document has not hitherto\r\nappeared.(1)\r\n\r\nIn appending the Memorial to his \"Letter to Washington,\" Paine would\r\nnaturally omit passages rendered unimportant by his release, but his\r\nfriend Bache may have suppressed others that might have embarrassed\r\nAmerican partisans of France, such as the scene at the king's trial.\r\n\r\n     1 Bache's pamphlet reproduces the portrait engraved in\r\n     Villenave, where it is underlined: \"Peint par Ped [Peale] à\r\n     Philadelphie, Dessiné par F. Bonneville, Gravé par Sandoz.\"\r\n     In Bache it is: \"Bolt sc. 1793 \"; and beneath this the\r\n     curious inscription: \"Thomas Paine. Secretair d. Americ:\r\n     Congr: 1780. Mitgl: d. fr. Nat. Convents. 1793.\" The\r\n     portrait is a variant of that now in Independence Hall, and\r\n     one of two painted by C. W. Peale. The other (in which the\r\n     chin is supported by the hand) was for religious reasons\r\n     refused by the Boston Museum when it purchased the\r\n     collection of \"American Heroes\" from Rembrandt Peale. It was\r\n     bought by John McDonough, whose brother sold it to Mr.\r\n     Joseph Jefferson, the eminent actor, and perished when his\r\n     house was burned at Buzzard's Bay. Mr. Jefferson writes me\r\n     that he meant to give the portrait to the Paine Memorial\r\n     Society, Boston; \"but the cruel fire roasted the splendid\r\n     _Infidel_, so I presume the saints are satisfied.\"\r\n\r\nThis description, however, and a large proportion of the suppressed\r\npages, are historically among the most interesting parts of the\r\nMemorial, and their restoration renders it necessary to transfer the\r\ndocument from its place as an appendix to that of a preliminary to the\r\n\"Letter to Washington.\"\r\n\r\nPaine's Letter to Washington burdens his reputation today more,\r\nprobably, than any other production of his pen. The traditional judgment\r\nwas formed in the absence of many materials necessary for a just\r\nverdict. The editor feels under the necessity of introducing at this\r\npoint an historical episode; he cannot regard it as fair to the memory\r\nof either Paine or Washington that these two chapters should be printed\r\nwithout a full statement of the circumstances, the most important of\r\nwhich, but recently discovered, were unknown to either of those men. In\r\nthe editor's \"Life of Thomas Paine\" (ii., pp. 77-180) newly discovered\r\nfacts and documents bearing on the subject are given, which may\r\nbe referred to by those who desire to investigate critically such\r\nstatements as may here appear insufficiently supported. Considerations\r\nof space require that the history in that work should be only summarized\r\nhere, especially as important new details must be added.\r\n\r\nPaine was imprisoned (December 28, 1793) through the hostility of\r\nGouverneur Morris, the American Minister in Paris. The fact that the\r\nUnited States, after kindling revolution in France by its example, was\r\nthen represented in that country by a Minister of vehement royalist\r\nopinions, and one who literally entered into the service of the King to\r\ndefeat the Republic, has been shown by that Minister's own biographers.\r\nSome light is cast on the events that led to this strange situation by\r\na letter written to M. de Mont-morin, Minister of Foreign Affairs, by\r\na French Chargé d'Affaires, Louis Otto, dated Philadelphia, 10 March,\r\n1792. Otto, a nobleman who married into the Livingston family, was an\r\nastute diplomatist, and enjoyed the intimacy of the Secretary of\r\nState, Jefferson, and of his friends. At the close of a long interview\r\nJefferson tells him that \"The secresy with which the Senate covers its\r\ndeliberations serves to veil personal interest, which reigns therein in\r\nall its strength.\" Otto explains this as referring to the speculative\r\noperations of Senators, and to the commercial connections some of them\r\nhave with England, making them unfriendly to French interests.\r\n\r\n\"Among the latter the most remarkable is Mr. Robert Morris, of English\r\nbirth, formerly Superintendent of Finance, a man of greatest talent,\r\nwhose mercantile speculations are as unlimited as his ambition. He\r\ndirects the Senate as he once did the American finances in making it\r\nkeep step with his policy and his business.... About two years ago Mr.\r\nRobert Morris sent to France Mr. Gouverneur Morris to negotiate a loan\r\nin his name, and for different other personal matters.... During his\r\nsojourn in France, Mr. Rob. Morris thought he could make him more useful\r\nfor his aims by inducing the President of the United States to entrust\r\nhim with a negotiation with England relative to the Commerce of the two\r\ncountries. M. Gouv. Morris acquitted himself in this as an adroit man,\r\nand with his customary zeal, but despite his address (insinuation)\r\nobtained only the vague hope of an advantageous commercial treaty on\r\ncondition of an _Alliance resembling that between France and the United\r\nStates_.... [Mr. Robert Morris] is himself English, and interested in\r\nall the large speculations founded in this country for Great Britain....\r\nHis great services as Superintendent of Finance during the Revolution\r\nhave assured him the esteem and consideration of General Washington,\r\nwho, however, is far from adopting his views about France. The warmth\r\nwith which Mr. Rob. Morris opposed in the Senate the exemption of French\r\n_armateurs_ from tonnage, demanded by His Majesty, undoubtedly had\r\nfor its object to induce the king, by this bad behavior, to break the\r\ntreaty, in order to facilitate hereafter the negotiations begun with\r\nEngland to form an alliance. As for Mr. Gouv. Morris he is entirely\r\ndevoted to his correspondent, with whom he has been constantly connected\r\nin business and opinion. His great talents are recognized, and his\r\nextreme quickness in conceiving new schemes and gaining others to them.\r\nHe is perhaps the most eloquent and ingenious man of his country, but\r\nhis countrymen themselves distrust his talents. They admire but fear\r\nhim.\" (1)\r\n\r\n     1 Archives of the State Department, Paris, États Unis.,\r\n      vol. 35, fol. 301.\r\n\r\nThe Commission given to Gouverneur Morris by Washington, to which\r\nOtto refers, was in his own handwriting, dated October 13, 1789, and\r\nauthorized him \"in the capacity of private agent, and in the credit of\r\nthis letter, to converse with His Britannic Majesty's ministers on these\r\npoints, viz. whether there be any, and what objection to performing\r\nthose articles of the treaty which remained to be performed on his part;\r\nand whether they incline to a treaty of commerce on any and what terms.\r\nThis communication ought regularly to be made to you by the Secretary\r\nof State; but, that office not being at present filled, my desire of\r\navoiding delays induces me to make it under my own hand.\"(1)\r\n\r\nThe President could hardly have assumed the authority of secretly\r\nappointing a virtual ambassador had there not been a tremendous object\r\nin view: this, as he explains in an accompanying letter, was to\r\nsecure the evacuation by Great Britain of the frontier posts. This\r\nall-absorbing purpose of Washington is the key to his administration.\r\nGouverneur Morris paved the way for Jay's treaty, and he was paid for\r\nit with the French mission. The Senate would not have tolerated his\r\nappointment to England, and only by a majority of four could the\r\nPresident secure his confirmation as Minister to France (January 12,\r\n1792). The President wrote Gouverneur Morris (January 28th) a friendly\r\nlecture about the objections made to him, chiefly that he favored the\r\naristocracy and was unfriendly to the revolution, and expressed \"the\r\nfullest confidence\" that, supposing the allegations founded, he would\r\n\"effect a change.\" But Gouverneur Morris remained the agent of Senator\r\nRobert Morris, and still held Washington's mission to England, and he\r\nknew only as \"conspirators\" the rulers who succeeded Louis XVI. Even\r\nwhile utilizing them, he was an agent of Great Britain in its war\r\nagainst the country to which he was officially commissioned.\r\n\r\n     1 Ford's \"Writings of George Washington\" vol. xi., p. 440.\r\n\r\nLafayette wrote to Washington (\"Paris, March 15,1792\") the following\r\nappeal:\r\n\r\n\"Permit me, my dear General, to make an observation for yourself alone,\r\non the recent selection of an American ambassador. Personally I am a\r\nfriend of Gouverneur Morris, and have always been, in private, quite\r\ncontent with him; but the aristocratic and really contra-revolutionary\r\nprinciples which he has avowed render him little fit to represent the\r\nonly government resembling ours.... I cannot repress the desire that\r\nAmerican and French principles should be in the heart and on the lips of\r\nthe ambassador of the United States in France.\" (1)\r\n\r\nIn addition to this; two successive Ministers from France, after the\r\nfall of the Monarchy, conveyed to the American Government the most\r\nearnest remonstrances against the continuance of Gouverneur Morris in\r\ntheir country, one of them reciting the particular offences of which\r\nhe was guilty. The President's disregard of all these protests and\r\nentreaties, unexampled perhaps in history, had the effect of giving\r\nGouverneur Morris enormous power over the country against which he\r\nwas intriguing. He was recognized as the Irremovable. He represented\r\nWashington's fixed and unalterable determination, and this at a moment\r\nwhen the main purpose of the revolutionary leaders was to preserve the\r\nalliance with America. Robespierre at that time ( 1793) had special\r\ncharge of diplomatic affairs, and it is shown by the French historian,\r\nFrédéric Masson, that he was very anxious to recover for the republic\r\nthe initiative of the American alliance credited to the king; and\r\n\"although their Minister, Gouverneur Morris, was justly suspected,\r\nand the American republic was at that time aiming only to utilize the\r\ncondition of its ally, the French republic cleared it at a cheap rate of\r\nits debts contracted with the King.\"(2) Morris adroitly held this\r\ndoubt, whether the alliance of his government with Louis XVI. would\r\nbe continued to that King's executioners, over the head of the\r\nrevolutionists, as a suspended sword. Under that menace, and with\r\nthe authentication of being Washington's irremovable mouthpiece, this\r\nMinister had only to speak and it was done.\r\n\r\n     1 \"Mémoire», etc., du General Lafayette,\" Bruxelles, 1837,\r\n     tome ii., pp. 484,485.\r\n\r\n     2 \"Le Département des Affaires Étrangères pendant la\r\n     Révolution,\" p. 395.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Gouverneur Morris was steadily working in France for the\r\naim which he held in common with Robert Morris, namely to transfer the\r\nalliance from France to England. These two nations being at war, it was\r\nimpossible for France to fulfil all the terms of the alliance; it could\r\nnot permit English ships alone to seize American provisions on the seas,\r\nand it was compelled to prevent American vessels from leaving French\r\nports with cargoes certain of capture by British cruisers. In this way\r\na large number of American Captains with their ships were detained in\r\nFrance, to their distress, but to their Minister's satisfaction. He did\r\nnot fail to note and magnify all \"infractions\" of the treaty, with the\r\nhope that they might be the means of annulling it in favor of England,\r\nand he did nothing to mitigate sufferings which were counts in his\r\nindictment of the Treaty.\r\n\r\nIt was at this point that Paine came in the American Minister's way. He\r\nhad been on good terms with Gouverneur Morris, who in 1790 (May 29th)\r\nwrote from London to the President:\r\n\r\n\"On the 17th Mr. Paine called to tell me that he had conversed on the\r\nsame subject [impressment of American seamen] with Mr. Burke, who had\r\nasked him if there was any minister, consul, or other agent of the\r\nUnited States who could properly make application to the Government: to\r\nwhich he had replied in the negative; but said that I was here, who had\r\nbeen a member of Congress, and was therefore the fittest person to step\r\nforward. In consequence of what passed thereupon between them he [Paine]\r\nurged me to take the matter up, which I promised to do. On the 18th I\r\nwrote to the Duke of Leeds requesting an interview.\"\r\n\r\n     1 Force's \"American State Papers, For. Rel.,\" vol. i.\r\n\r\nAt that time (1790) Paine was as yet a lion in London, thus able to\r\ngive Morris a lift. He told Morris, in 1792 that he considered his\r\nappointment to France a mistake. This was only on the ground of his\r\nanti-republican opinions; he never dreamed of the secret commissions\r\nto England. He could not have supposed that the Minister who had so\r\npromptly presented the case of impressed seamen in England would\r\nnot equally attend to the distressed Captains in France; but these,\r\nneglected by their Minister, appealed to Paine. Paine went to see\r\nMorris, with whom he had an angry interview, during which he asked\r\nMorris \"if he did not feel ashamed to take the money of the country\r\nand do nothing for it.\" Paine thus incurred the personal enmity of\r\nGouverneur Morris. By his next step he endangered this Minister's\r\nscheme for increasing the friction between France and America; for\r\nPaine advised the Americans to appeal directly to the Convention, and\r\nintroduced them to that body, which at once heeded their application,\r\nMorris being left out of the matter altogether. This was August 22d, and\r\nMorris was very angry. It is probable that the Americans in Paris\r\nfelt from that time that Paine was in danger, for on September 13th a\r\nmemorial, evidently concocted by them, was sent to the French government\r\nproposing that they should send Commissioners to the United States to\r\nforestall the intrigues of England, and that Paine should go with them,\r\nand set forth their case in the journals, as he \"has great influence\r\nwith the people.\" This looks like a design to get Paine safely out of\r\nthe country, but it probably sealed his fate. Had Paine gone to America\r\nand reported there Morris's treacheries to France and to his own\r\ncountry, and his licentiousness, notorious in Paris, which his diary has\r\nrecently revealed to the world, the career of the Minister would have\r\nswiftly terminated. Gouverneur Morris wrote to Robert Morris that\r\nPaine was intriguing for his removal, and intimates that he (Paine) was\r\nambitious of taking his place in Paris. Paine's return to America must\r\nbe prevented.\r\n\r\nHad the American Minister not been well known as an enemy of the\r\nrepublic it might have been easy to carry Paine from the Convention to\r\nthe guillotine; but under the conditions the case required all of the\r\ningenuity even of a diplomatist so adroit as Gouverneur Morris. But fate\r\nhad played into his hand. It so happened that Louis Otto, whose letter\r\nfrom Philadelphia has been quoted, had become chief secretary to the\r\nMinister of Foreign Affairs in Paris, M. Deforgues. This Minister and\r\nhis Secretary, apprehending the fate that presently overtook both, were\r\nanxious to be appointed to America. No one knew better than Otto the\r\ncommanding influence of Gouverneur Morris, as Washington's \"irremovable\"\r\nrepresentative, both in France and America, and this desire of the two\r\nfrightened officials to get out of France was confided to him.(1) By\r\nhope of his aid, and by this compromising confidence, Deforgues came\r\nunder the power of a giant who used it like a giant. Morris at\r\nonce hinted that Paine was fomenting the troubles given by Genêt to\r\nWashington in America, and thus set in motion the procedure by which\r\nPaine was ultimately lodged in prison.\r\n\r\nThere being no charge against Paine in France, and no ill-will felt\r\ntowards him by Robespierre, compliance with the supposed will of\r\nWashington was in this case difficult. Six months before, a law had been\r\npassed to imprison aliens of hostile nationality, which could not affect\r\nPaine, he being a member of the Convention and an American. But a decree\r\nwas passed, evidently to reach Paine, \"that no foreigner should be\r\nadmitted to represent the French people\"; by this he was excluded from\r\nthe Convention, and the Committee of General Surety enabled to take the\r\nfinal step of assuming that he was an Englishman, and thus under the\r\ndecree against aliens of hostile nations.(2)\r\n\r\n     1 Letter of Gouverneur Morris to Washington, Oct 19, 1793.\r\n     Sparks's \"Life of Gouverneur Morris,\" vol. ii., p. 375.\r\n\r\n     2 Although, as I have said, there was no charge against\r\n     Paine in France, and none assigned in any document connected\r\n     with his arrest, some kind of insinuation had to be made in\r\n     the Convention to cover proceedings against a Deputy, and\r\n     Bourdon de l'Oise said, \"I know that he has intrigued with a\r\n     former agent of the bureau of Foreign Affairs.\" It will be\r\n     seen by the third addendum to the Memorial to Monroe that\r\n     Paine supposed this to refer to Louis Otto, who had been his\r\n     interpreter in an interview requested by Barère, of the\r\n     Committee of Public Safety. But as Otto was then, early in\r\n     September, 1793, Secretary in the Foreign Office, and Barère\r\n     a fellow-terrorist of Bourdon, there could be no accusation\r\n     based on an interview which, had it been probed, would have\r\n     put Paine's enemies to confusion. It is doubtful, however,\r\n     if Paine was right in his conjecture. The reference of\r\n     Bourdon was probably to the collusion between Paine and\r\n     Genêt suggested by Morris.\r\n\r\nPaine was thus lodged in prison simply to please Washington, to whom\r\nit was left to decide whether he had been rightly represented by his\r\nMinister in the case. When the large number of Americans in Paris\r\nhastened in a body to the Convention to demand his release, the\r\nPresident (Vadier) extolled Paine, but said his birth in England brought\r\nhim under the measures of safety, and referred them to the Committees.\r\nThere they were told that \"their reclamation was only the act of\r\nindividuals, without any authority from the American Government.\"\r\nUnfortunately the American petitioners, not understanding by this a\r\nreference to the President, unsuspiciously repaired to Morris, as\r\nalso did Paine by letter. The Minister pretended compliance, thereby\r\npreventing their direct appeal to the President. Knowing, however, that\r\nAmerica would never agree that nativity under the British flag made\r\nPaine any more than other Americans a citizen of England, the American\r\nMinister came from Sain-port, where he resided, to Paris, and secured\r\nfrom the obedient Deforgues a certificate that he had reclaimed Paine\r\nas an American citizen, but that he was held as a _French_ citizen.\r\nThis ingeniously prepared certificate which was sent to the Secretary\r\nof State (Jefferson), and Morris's pretended \"reclamation,\" _which was\r\nnever sent to America_, are translated in my \"Life of Paine,\" and here\r\ngiven in the original.\r\n\r\n\r\nÀ Paris le 14 février 1794, 26 pluviôse.\r\n\r\nLe Minisire plénipotentiaire des États Unis de l'Amérique près la\r\nRépublique française au Ministre des Affaires Étrangères.\r\n\r\nMonsieur:\r\n\r\nThomas Paine vient de s'adresser à moi pour que je le réclame comme\r\nCitoyen des États Unis.

Translations:--Morris: \"Sir,--Thomas Paine has just\r\n     applied to me to claim him as a citizen of the United\r\n     States. Here (I believe) are the facts relating to him. He\r\n     was born in England. Having afterwards become a citizen of\r\n     the United States, he acquired great celebrity there by his\r\n     revolutionary writings. In consequence he was adopted a\r\n     French citizen and then elected Member of the Convention.\r\n     His conduct since this epoch is out of my jurisdiction. I am\r\n     ignorant of the reason for his present detention in the\r\n     Luxembourg prison, but I beg you, sir (if reasons unknown to\r\n     me prevent his liberation), be so good as to inform me, that\r\n     I may communicate them to the government of the United\r\n     States.\" Deporgurs: \"By your letter of the 36th of last\r\n     month you reclaim the liberty of Thomas Paine as an American\r\n     citizen. Born in England, this ex-deputy has become\r\n     successively an American and a French citizen. In accepting\r\n     this last title, and in occupying a place in the Corps\r\n     Législatif he submitted himself to the laws of the Republic,\r\n     and has certainly renounced the protection which the law of\r\n     nations, and treaties concluded with the United States,\r\n     could have assured him. I am ignorant of the motives of his\r\n     detention, but I must presume they are well founded. I shall\r\n     nevertheless submit to the Committee of Public Safety the\r\n     demand you have addressed to me, and I shall lose no time in\r\n     letting you know its decision.\"\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that Deforgues begins his letter with a falsehood: \"You\r\nreclaim the liberty of Paine as an American citizen.\" Morris's letter\r\nhad declared him a French citizen out of his (the American Minister's)\r\n\"jurisdiction.\" Morris states for Deforgues his case, and it is\r\nobediently adopted, though quite discordant with the decree, which\r\nimprisoned Paine as a foreigner. Deforgues also makes Paine a member\r\nof a non-existent body, the \"Corps Législatif,\" which might suggest\r\nin Philadelphia previous connection with the defunct Assembly. No such\r\ninquiries as Deforgues promised, nor any, were ever made, and of course\r\nnone were intended. Morris had got from Deforgues the certificate he\r\nneeded to show in Philadelphia and to Americans in Paris. His pretended\r\n\"reclamation\" was of course withheld: no copy of it ever reached America\r\ntill brought from French archives by the present writer. Morris does\r\nnot appear to have ventured even to keep a copy of it himself. The draft\r\n(presumably in English), found among his papers by Sparks, alters the\r\nfatal sentence which deprived Paine of his American citizenship and of\r\nprotection. \"Res-sort\"--jurisdiction--which has a definite technical\r\nmeaning in the mouth of a Minister, is changed to \"cognizance\"; the\r\nsentence is made to read, \"his conduct from that time has not come under\r\nmy cognizance.\" (Sparks's \"Life of Gouverneur Morris,\" i., p. 401).\r\nEven as it stands in his book, Sparks says: \"The application, it must\r\nbe confessed, was neither pressing in its terms, nor cogent in its\r\narguments.\"\r\n\r\nThe American Minister, armed with this French missive, dictated by\r\nhimself, enclosed it to the Secretary of State, whom he supposed to be\r\nstill Jefferson, with a letter stating that he had reclaimed Paine as an\r\nAmerican, that he (Paine) was held to answer for \"crimes,\" and that any\r\nfurther attempt to release him would probably be fatal to the prisoner.\r\nBy these falsehoods, secured from detection by the profound secrecy of\r\nthe Foreign Offices in both countries, Morris paralyzed all interference\r\nfrom America, as Washington could not of course intervene in behalf of\r\nan American charged with \"crimes\" committed in a foreign country, except\r\nto demand his trial. But it was important also to paralyze further\r\naction by Americans in Paris, and to them, too, was shown the French\r\ncertificate of a reclamation never made. A copy was also sent to Paine,\r\nwho returned to Morris an argument which he entreated him to embody in\r\na further appeal to the French Minister. This document was of course\r\nburied away among the papers of Morris, who never again mentioned Paine\r\nin any communication to the French government, but contented himself\r\nwith personal slanders of his victim in private letters to Washington's\r\nfriend, Robert Morris, and no doubt others. I quote Sparks's summary of\r\nthe argument unsuspectingly sent by Paine to Morris:\r\n\r\n\"He first proves himself to have been an American citizen, a character\r\nof which he affirms no subsequent act had deprived him. The title of\r\nFrench citizen was a mere nominal and honorary one, which the\r\nConvention chose to confer, when they asked him to help them in making a\r\nConstitution. But let the nature or honor of the title be what it might,\r\nthe Convention had taken it away of their own accord. 'He was\r\nexcluded from the Convention on the motion for excluding _foreigners_.\r\nConsequently he was no longer under the law of the Republic as a\r\n_citizen_, but under the protection of the Treaty of Alliance, as fully\r\nand effectually as any other citizen of America. It was therefore the\r\nduty of the American Minister to demand his release.'\"\r\n\r\nTo this Sparks adds:\r\n\r\n\"Such is the drift of Paine's argument, and it would seem indeed that\r\nhe could not be a foreigner and a citizen at the same time. It was hard\r\nthat his only privilege of citizenship should be that of imprisonment.\r\nBut this logic was a little too refined for the revolutionary tribunals\r\nof the Jacobins in Paris, and Mr. Morris well knew it was not worth\r\nwhile to preach it to them. He did not believe there was any serious\r\ndesign at that time against the life of the prisoner, and he considered\r\nhis best chance of safety to be in preserving silence for the present.\r\nHere the matter rested, and Paine was left undisturbed till the arrival\r\nof Mr. Monroe, who procured his discharge from confinement.\" (\"Life of\r\nGouverneur Morris,\" i., p. 417.)l\r\n\r\nSparks takes the gracious view of the man whose Life he was writing, but\r\nthe facts now known turn his words to sarcasm. The Terror by which Paine\r\nsuffered was that of Morris, who warned him and his friends, both in\r\nParis and America, that if his case was stirred the knife would fall\r\non him. Paine declares (see xx.) that this danger kept him silent till\r\nafter the fall of Robespierre. None knew so well as Morris that\r\nthere were no charges against Paine for offences in France, and that\r\nRobespierre was awaiting that action by Washington which he (Morris) had\r\nrendered impossible. Having thus suspended the knife over Paine for six\r\nmonths, Robespierre interpreted the President's silence, and that\r\nof Congress, as confirmation of Morris's story, and resolved on the\r\nexecution of Paine \"in the interests of America as well as of France\";\r\nin other words to conciliate Washington to the endangered alliance with\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\nPaine escaped the guillotine by the strange accident related in a\r\nfurther chapter. The fall of Robespierre did not of course end his\r\nimprisonment, for he was not Robespierre's but Washington's prisoner.\r\nMorris remained Minister in France nearly a month after Robespierre's\r\ndeath, but the word needed to open Paine's prison was not spoken.\r\nAfter his recall, had Monroe been able at once to liberate Paine, an\r\ninvestigation must have followed, and Morris would probably have taken\r\nhis prisoner's place in the Luxembourg. But Morris would not present his\r\nletters of recall, and refused to present his successor, thus keeping\r\nMonroe out of his office four weeks. In this he was aided by Bourdon\r\nde l'Oise (afterwards banished as a royalist conspirator, but now a\r\ncommissioner to decide on prisoners); also by tools of Robespierre who\r\nhad managed to continue on the Committee of Public Safety by laying\r\ntheir crimes on the dead scapegoat--Robespierre. Against Barère (who had\r\nsigned Paine's death-warrant), Billaud-Varennes, and Colloit d'Her-bois,\r\nPaine, if liberated, would have been a terrible witness. The Committee\r\nruled by them had suppressed Paine's appeal to the Convention, as they\r\npresently suppressed Monroe's first appeal. Paine, knowing that Monroe\r\nhad arrived, but never dreaming that the manoeuvres of Morris were\r\nkeeping him out of office, wrote him from prison the following letters,\r\nhitherto unpublished.\r\n\r\n     1 There is no need to delay the reader here with any\r\n     argument about Paine's unquestionable citizenship, that\r\n     point having been settled by his release as an American, and\r\n     the sanction of Monroe's action by his government. There was\r\n     no genuineness in any challenge of Paine's citizenship, but\r\n     a mere desire to do him an injury. In this it had marvellous\r\n     success. Ten years after Paine had been reclaimed by Monroe,\r\n     with the sanction of Washington, as an American citizen, his\r\n     vote was refused at New Rochelle, New York, by the\r\n     supervisor, Elisha Ward, on the ground that Washington and\r\n     Morris had refused to Declaim him. Under his picture of the\r\n     dead Paine, Jarvis, the artist, wrote: \"A man who devoted\r\n     his whole life to the attainment of two objects--rights of\r\n     man, and freedom of conscience--had his vote denied when\r\n     living, and was denied a grave when dead.\"--_Editor._\r\n\r\n\r\nAugust 17th, 1794.\r\n\r\nMy Dear Sir: As I believe none of the public papers have announced your\r\nname right I am unable to address you by it, but a _new_ minister from\r\nAmerica is joy to me and will be so to every American in France.\r\n\r\nEight months I have been imprisoned, and I know not for what, except\r\nthat the order says that I am a Foreigner. The Illness I have suffered\r\nin this place (and from which I am but just recovering) had nearly put\r\nan end to my existence. My life is but of little value to me in\r\nthis situation tho' I have borne it with a firmness of patience and\r\nfortitude.\r\n\r\nI enclose you a copy of a letter, (as well the translation as the\r\nEnglish)--which I sent to the Convention after the fall of the Monster\r\nRobespierre--for I was determined not to write a line during the time of\r\nhis detestable influence. I sent also a copy to the Committee of public\r\nsafety--but I have not heard any thing respecting it. I have now\r\nno expectation of delivery but by your means--_Morris has been my\r\ninveterate enemy_ and I think he has permitted something of the national\r\nCharacter of America to suffer by quietly letting a Citizen of that\r\nCountry remain almost eight months in prison without making every\r\nofficial exertion to procure him justice,--for every act of violence\r\noffered to a foreigner is offered also to the Nation to which he\r\nbelongs.\r\n\r\nThe gentleman, Mr. Beresford, who will present you this has been very\r\nfriendly to me.(1) Wishing you happiness in your appointment, I am your\r\naffectionate friend and humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nAugust 18th, 1794.\r\n\r\nDear Sir: In addition to my letter of yesterday (sent to Mr. Beresford\r\nto be conveyed to you but which is delayed on account of his being at\r\nSt. Germain) I send the following memoranda.\r\n\r\nI was in London at the time I was elected a member of this Convention.\r\nI was elected a Deputé in four different departments without my knowing\r\nany thing of the matter, or having the least idea of it. The intention\r\nof electing the Convention before the time of the former Legislature\r\nexpired, was for the purpose of reforming the Constitution or rather for\r\nforming a new one. As the former Legislature shewed a disposition that\r\nI should assist in this business of the new Constitution, they prepared\r\nthe way by voting me a French Citoyen (they conferred the same title\r\non General Washington and certainly I had no more idea than he had of\r\nvacating any part of my real Citizenship of America for a nominal one in\r\nFrance, especially at a time when she did not know whether she would\r\nbe a Nation or not, and had it not even in her power to promise me\r\nprotection). I was elected (the second person in number of Votes, the\r\nAbbé Sieves being first) a member for forming the Constitution, and\r\nevery American in Paris as well as my other acquaintance knew that it\r\nwas my intention to return to America as soon as the Constitution should\r\nbe established. The violence of Party soon began to shew itself in the\r\nConvention, but it was impossible for me to see upon what principle they\r\ndiffered--unless it was a contention for power. I acted however as I\r\ndid in America, I connected myself with no Party, but considered myself\r\naltogether a National Man--but the case with Parties generally is that\r\nwhen you are not with one you are supposed to be with the other.\r\n\r\n     1 A friendly lamp-lighter, alluded to in the Letter to\r\n     Washington, conveyed this letter to Mr. Beresford.--\r\n     _Editor._\r\n\r\nI was taken out of bed between three and four in the morning on the\r\n28 of December last, and brought to the Luxembourg--without any other\r\naccusation inserted in the order than that I was a foreigner; a motion\r\nhaving been made two days before in the Convention to expel Foreigners\r\ntherefrom. I certainly then remained, even upon their own tactics, what\r\nI was before, a Citizen of America.\r\n\r\nAbout three weeks after my imprisonment the Americans that were in Paris\r\nwent to the bar of the Convention to reclaim me, but contrary to my\r\nadvice, they made their address into a Petition, and it miscarried.\r\nI then applied to G. Morris, to reclaim me as an official part of his\r\nduty, which he found it necessary to do, and here the matter stopt.(1)\r\nI have not heard a single line or word from any American since, which\r\nis now seven months. I rested altogether on the hope that a new Minister\r\nwould arrive from America. I have escaped with life from more dangers\r\nthan one. Had it not been for the fall of Roberspierre and your timely\r\narrival I know not what fate might have yet attended me. There seemed to\r\nbe a determination to destroy all the Prisoners without regard to merit,\r\ncharacter, or any thing else. During the time I laid at the height of my\r\nillness they took, in one night only, 169 persons out of this prison\r\nand executed all but eight. The distress that I have suffered at being\r\nobliged to exist in the midst of such horrors, exclusive of my own\r\nprecarious situation, suspended as it were by the single thread of\r\naccident, is greater than it is possible you can conceive--but thank God\r\ntimes are at last changed, and I hope that your Authority will release\r\nme from this unjust imprisonment.\r\n\r\n     1 The falsehood told Paine, accompanied by an intimation of\r\n     danger in pursuing the pretended reclamation, was of course\r\n     meant to stop any farther action by Paine or his friends.--\r\n     _Editor._.\r\n\r\n\r\nAugust 25, 1794.\r\n\r\nMy Dear Sir: Having nothing to do but to sit and think, I will write\r\nto pass away time, and to say that I am still here. I have received two\r\nnotes from Mr. Beresford which are encouraging (as the generality of\r\nnotes and letters are that arrive to persons here) but they contain\r\nnothing explicit or decisive with respect to my liberation, and _I\r\nshall be very glad to receive a line from yourself to inform me in what\r\ncondition the matter stands_. If I only glide out of prison by a sort\r\nof accident America gains no credit by my liberation, neither can my\r\nattachment to her be increased by such a circumstance. She has had the\r\nservices of my best days, she has my allegiance, she receives my portion\r\nof Taxes for my house in Borden Town and my farm at New Rochelle, and\r\nshe owes me protection both at home and thro' her Ministers abroad, yet\r\nI remain in prison, in the face of her Minister, at the arbitrary will\r\nof a committee.\r\n\r\nExcluded as I am from the knowledge of everything and left to a random\r\nof ideas, I know not what to think or how to act. Before there was\r\nany Minister here (for I consider Morris as none) and while the\r\nRobespierrian faction lasted, I had nothing to do but to keep my mind\r\ntranquil and expect the fate that was every day inflicted upon my\r\ncomrades, not individually but by scores. Many a man whom I have passed\r\nan hour with in conversation I have seen marching to his destruction the\r\nnext hour, or heard of it the next morning; for what rendered the scene\r\nmore horrible was that they were generally taken away at midnight, so\r\nthat every man went to bed with the apprehension of never seeing his\r\nfriends or the world again.\r\n\r\nI wish to impress upon you that all the changes that have taken place in\r\nParis have been sudden. There is now a moment of calm, but if thro' any\r\nover complaisance to the persons you converse with on the subject of my\r\nliberation, you omit procuring it for me _now_, you may have to lament\r\nthe fate of your friend when its too late. The loss of a Battle to the\r\nNorthward or other possible accident may happen to bring this about. I\r\nam not out of danger till I am out of Prison.\r\n\r\nYours affectionately.\r\n\r\nP. S.--I am now entirely without money. The Convention owes me 1800\r\nlivres salary which I know not how to get while I am here, nor do I know\r\nhow to draw for money on the rent of my farm in America. It is under\r\nthe care of my good friend General Lewis Morris. I have received no rent\r\nsince I have been in Europe.\r\n\r\n[Addressed] Minister Plenipotentiary from America, Maison des Étrangers,\r\nRue de la Loi, Rue Richelieu.\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch was the sufficiently cruel situation when there reached Paine in\r\nprison, September 4th, the letter of Peter Whiteside which caused him\r\nto write his Memorial. Whiteside was a Philadelphian whose bankruptcy in\r\nLondon had swallowed up some of Paine's means. His letter, reporting to\r\nPaine that he was not regarded by the American Government or people as\r\nan American citizen, and that no American Minister could interfere in\r\nhis behalf, was evidently inspired by Morris who was still in Paris, the\r\nauthorities being unwilling to give him a passport to Switzerland,\r\nas they knew he was going in that direction to join the conspirators\r\nagainst France. This Whiteside letter put Paine, and through him Monroe,\r\non a false scent by suggesting that the difficulty of his case lay in a\r\n_bona fide_ question of citizenship, whereas there never had been really\r\nany such question. The knot by which Morris had bound Paine was thus\r\nconcealed, and Monroe was appealing to polite wolves in the interest of\r\ntheir victim. There were thus more delays, inexplicable alike to Monroe\r\nand to Paine, eliciting from the latter some heartbroken letters, not\r\nhitherto printed, which I add at the end of the Memorial. To add to\r\nthe difficulties and dangers, Paris was beginning to be agitated by\r\nwell-founded rumors of Jay's injurious negotiations in England, and a\r\ncoldness towards Monroe was setting in. Had Paine's release been delayed\r\nmuch longer an American Minister's friendship might even have proved\r\nfatal. Of all this nothing could be known to Paine, who suffered agonies\r\nhe had not known during the Reign of Terror. The other prisoners of\r\nRobespierre's time had departed; he alone paced the solitary corridors\r\nof the Luxembourg, chilled by the autumn winds, his cell tireless, unlit\r\nby any candle, insufficiently nourished, an abscess forming in his side;\r\nall this still less cruel than the feeling that he was abandoned, not\r\nonly by Washington but by all America.\r\n\r\nThis is the man of whom Washington wrote to Madison nine years before:\r\n\"Must the merits and services of 'Common Sense' continue to glide down\r\nthe stream of time unrewarded by this country?\" This, then, is his\r\nreward. To his old comrade in the battle-fields of Liberty, George\r\nWashington, Paine owed his ten months of imprisonment, at the end of\r\nwhich Monroe found him a wreck, and took him (November 4) to his own\r\nhouse, where he and his wife nursed him back into life. But it was not\r\nfor some months supposed that Paine could recover; it was only after\r\nseveral relapses; and it was under the shadow of death that he wrote the\r\nletter to Washington so much and so ignorantly condemned. Those who have\r\nfollowed the foregoing narrative will know that Paine's grievances were\r\ngenuine, that his infamous treatment stains American history; but they\r\nwill also know that they lay chiefly at the door of a treacherous and\r\nunscrupulous American Minister.\r\n\r\nYet it is difficult to find an excuse for the retention of that Minister\r\nin France by Washington. On Monroe's return to America in 1797, he\r\nwrote a pamphlet concerning the mission from which he had been curtly\r\nrecalled, in which he said:\r\n\r\n\"I was persuaded from Mr. Morris's known political character and\r\nprinciples, that his appointment, and especially at a period when the\r\nFrench nation was in a course of revolution from an arbitrary to a free\r\ngovernment, would tend to discountenance the republican cause there\r\nand at home, and otherwise weaken, and greatly to our prejudice, the\r\nconnexion subsisting between the two countries.\"\r\n\r\nIn a copy of this pamphlet found at Mount Vernon, Washington wrote on\r\nthe margin of this sentence:\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Morris was known to be a man of first rate abilities; and his\r\nintegrity and honor had never been impeached. Besides, Mr. Morris was\r\nsent whilst the kingly government was in existence, ye end of 91 or\r\nbeginning of 92.\" (1)\r\n\r\nBut this does not explain why Gouverneur Morris was persistently kept in\r\nFrance after monarchy was abolished (September 21, 1792), or even after\r\nLafayette's request for his removal, already quoted. To that letter\r\nof Lafayette no reply has been discovered. After the monarchy was\r\nabolished, Ternant and Genêt successively carried to America protests\r\nfrom their Foreign Office against the continuance of a Minister in\r\nFrance, who was known in Paris, and is now known to all acquainted with\r\nhis published papers, to have all along made his office the headquarters\r\nof British intrigue against France, American interests being quite\r\nsubordinated. Washington did not know this, but he might have known it,\r\nand his disregard of French complaints can hardly be ascribed to any\r\nother cause than his delusion that Morris was deeply occupied with\r\nthe treaty negotiations confided to him. It must be remembered that\r\nWashington believed such a treaty with England to be the alternative of\r\nwar.(2) On that apprehension the British party in America, and British\r\nagents, played to the utmost, and under such influences Washington\r\nsacrificed many old friendships,--with Jefferson, Madison, Monroe,\r\nEdmund Randolph, Paine,--and also the confidence of his own State,\r\nVirginia.\r\n\r\n     1  Washington's marginal notes on Monroe's \"View, etc.,\"\r\n     were first fully given in Ford's \"Writings of Washington,\"\r\n     vol. xiii., p. 452, seq.\r\n\r\n     2 Ibid., p. 453.\r\n\r\nThere is a traditional impression that Paine's angry letter to\r\nWashington was caused by the President's failure to inter-pose for\r\nhis relief from prison. But Paine believed that the American Minister\r\n(Morris) had reclaimed him in some feeble fashion, as an American\r\ncitizen, and he knew that the President had officially approved Monroe's\r\naction in securing his release. His grievance was that Washington, whose\r\nletters of friendship he cherished, who had extolled his services to\r\nAmerica, should have manifested no concern personally, made no use of\r\nhis commanding influence to rescue him from daily impending death, sent\r\nto his prison no word of kindness or inquiry, and sent over their mutual\r\nfriend Monroe without any instructions concerning him; and finally, that\r\nhis private letter, asking explanation, remained unanswered. No doubt\r\nthis silence of Washington concerning the fate of Paine, whom he\r\nacknowledged to be an American citizen, was mainly due to his fear\r\nof offending England, which had proclaimed Paine. The \"outlaw's\"\r\nimprisonment in Paris caused jubilations among the English gentry,\r\nand went on simultaneously with Jay's negotiations in London, when any\r\nexpression by Washington of sympathy with Paine (certain of publication)\r\nmight have imperilled the Treaty, regarded by the President as vital.\r\n\r\nSo anxious was the President about this, that what he supposed had been\r\ndone for Paine by Morris, and what had really been done by Monroe,\r\nwas kept in such profound secrecy, that even his Secretary of State,\r\nPickering, knew nothing of it. This astounding fact I recently\r\ndiscovered in the manuscripts of that Secretary.(1) Colonel Pickering,\r\nwhile flattering enough to the President in public, despised his\r\nintellect, and among his papers is a memorandum concluding as follows:\r\n\r\n\"But when the hazards of the Revolutionary War had ended, by the\r\nestablishment of our Independence, why was the knowledge of General\r\nWashington's comparatively defective mental powers not freely divulged?\r\nWhy, even by the enemies of his civil administration were his abilities\r\nvery tenderly glanced at? --Because there were few, if any men, who\r\ndid not revere him for his distinguished virtues; his modesty--his\r\nunblemished integrity, his pure and disinterested patriotism. These\r\nvirtues, of infinitely more value than exalted abilities without them,\r\nsecured to him the veneration and love of his fellow citizens at large.\r\nThus immensely popular, no man was willing to publish, under his hand,\r\neven the simple truth. The only exception, that I recollect, was the\r\ninfamous Tom Paine; and this when in France, after he had escaped the\r\nguillotine of Robespierre; and in resentment, because, after he had\r\nparticipated in the French Revolution, President Washington seemed\r\nnot to have thought him so very important a character in the world,\r\nas officially to interpose for his relief from the fangs of the French\r\nephemeral Rulers. In a word, no man, however well informed, was willing\r\nto hazard his own popularity by exhibiting the real intellectual\r\ncharacter of the immensely popular Washington.\"\r\n\r\n     1 Massachusetts Historical Society, vol. 11., p. 171.\r\n\r\nHow can this ignorance of an astute man, Secretary of State under\r\nWashington and Adams, be explained? Had Washington hidden the letters\r\nshowing on their face that he _had_ \"officially interposed\" for Paine by\r\ntwo Ministers?\r\n\r\nMadison, writing to Monroe, April 7, 1796, says that Pickering had\r\nspoken to him \"in harsh terms\" of a letter written by Paine to the\r\nPresident. This was a private letter of September 20, 1795, afterwards\r\nprinted in Paine's public Letter to Washington. The Secretary certainly\r\nread that letter on its arrival, January 18, 1796, and yet Washington\r\ndoes not appear to have told him of what had been officially done in\r\nPaine's case! Such being the secrecy which Washington had carried from\r\nthe camp to the cabinet, and the morbid extent of it while the British\r\nTreaty was in negotiation and discussion, one can hardly wonder at his\r\nsilence under Paine's private appeal and public reproach.\r\n\r\nMuch as Pickering hated Paine, he declares him the only man who ever\r\ntold the simple truth about Washington. In the lapse of time historical\r\nresearch, while removing the sacred halo of Washington, has revealed\r\nbeneath it a stronger brain than was then known to any one. Paine\r\npublished what many whispered, while they were fawning on Washington for\r\noffice, or utilizing his power for partisan ends. Washington, during his\r\nsecond administration, when his mental decline was remarked by\r\nhimself, by Jefferson, and others, was regarded by many of his eminent\r\ncontemporaries as fallen under the sway of small partisans. Not only\r\nwas the influence of Jefferson, Madison, Randolph, Monroe, Livingston,\r\nalienated, but the counsels of Hamilton were neutralized by Wolcott and\r\nPickering, who apparently agreed about the President's \"mental powers.\"\r\nHad not Paine previously incurred the _odium theologicum_, his pamphlet\r\nconcerning Washington would have been more damaging; even as it was, the\r\nverdict was by no means generally favorable to the President, especially\r\nas the replies to Paine assumed that Washington had indeed failed to\r\ntry and rescue him from impending death.(1) A pamphlet written by Bache,\r\nprinted anonymously (1797), Remarks occasioned by the late conduct of\r\nMr. Washington, indicates the belief of those who raised Washington to\r\npower, that both Randolph and Paine had been sacrificed to please Great\r\nBritain.\r\n\r\nThe _Bien-informé_ (Paris, November 12, 1797) published a letter from\r\nPhiladelphia, which may find translation here as part of the history of\r\nthe pamphlet:\r\n\r\n\"The letter of Thomas Paine to General Washington is read here with\r\navidity. We gather from the English papers that the Cabinet of St James\r\nhas been unable to stop the circulation of that pamphlet in England,\r\nsince it is allowable to reprint there any English work already\r\npublished elsewhere, however disagreeable to Messrs. Pitt and Dundas.\r\nWe read in the letter to Washington that Robespierre had declared to\r\nthe Committee of Public Safety that it was desirable in the interests\r\nof both France and America that Thomas Paine, who, for seven or eight\r\nmonths had been kept a prisoner in the Luxembourg, should forthwith be\r\nbrought up for judgment before the revolutionary tribunal. The proof of\r\nthis fact is found in Robespierre's papers, and gives ground for strange\r\nsuspicions.\"\r\n\r\n     1 The principal ones were \"A Letter to Thomas Paine. By an\r\n     American Citizen. New York, 1797,\" and \"A Letter to the\r\n     infamous Tom Paine, in answer to his Letter to General\r\n     Washington. December 1796. By Peter Porcupine\" (Cobbett).\r\n     Writing to David Stuart, January 8,1797, Washington,\r\n     speaking of himself in the third person, says: \"Although\r\n     he is soon to become a private citizen, his opinions are to\r\n     be knocked down, and his character traduced as low as they\r\n     are capable of sinking it, even by resorting to absolute\r\n     falsehoods. As an evidence whereof, and of the plan they are\r\n     pursuing, I send you a letter of Mr. Paine to me, printed in\r\n     this city and disseminated with great industry. Enclosed you\r\n     will receive also a production of Peter Porcupine, alias\r\n     William Cobbett. Making allowances for the asperity of an\r\n     Englishman, for some of his strong and coarse expressions,\r\n     and a want of official information as to many facts, it is\r\n     not a bad thing.\" The \"many facts\" were, of course, the\r\n     action of Monroe, and the supposed action of Morris in\r\n     Paris, but not even to one so intimate as Stuart are these\r\n     disclosed.\r\n\r\n\"It was long believed that Paine had returned to America with his friend\r\nJames Monroe, and the lovers of freedom [there] congratulated themselves\r\non being able to embrace that illustrious champion of the Rights of Man.\r\nTheir hopes have been frustrated. We know positively that Thomas Paine\r\nis still living in France. The partizans of the late presidency [in\r\nAmerica] also know it well, yet they have spread a rumor that after\r\nactually arriving he found his (really popular) _principles no longer\r\nthe order of the day_, and thought best to re-embark.\r\n\r\n\"The English journals, while repeating this idle rumor, observed that it\r\nwas unfounded, and that Paine had not left France. Some French journals\r\nhave copied these London paragraphs, but without comments; so that at\r\nthe very moment when Thomas Paine's Letter on the 18th. Fructidor is\r\npublished, _La Clef du Cabinet_ says that this citizen is suffering\r\nunpleasantness in America.\"\r\n\r\nPaine had intended to return with Monroe, in the spring of 1797, but,\r\nsuspecting the Captain and a British cruiser in the distance, returned\r\nfrom Havre to Paris. The packet was indeed searched by the cruiser\r\nfor Paine, and, had he been captured, England would have executed the\r\nsentence pronounced by Robespierre to please Washington.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMEMORIAL ADDRESSED TO JAMES MONROE,\r\n\r\nMINISTER FROM THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA TO THE FRENCH REPUBLIC.\r\n\r\nPrison of the Luxembourg, Sept. 10th, 1794.\r\n\r\nI address this memorial to you, in consequence of a letter I received\r\nfrom a friend, 18 Fructidor (September 4th,) in which he says, \"Mr.\r\nMonroe has told me, that he has no orders [meaning from the American\r\ngovernment] respecting you; but I am sure he will leave nothing\r\nundone to liberate you; but, from what I can learn, from all the late\r\nAmericans, you are not considered either by the Government, or by\r\nthe individuals, as an American citizen. You have been made a french\r\nCitizen, which you have accepted, and you have further made yourself\r\na servant of the french Republic; and, therefore, it would be out\r\nof character for an American Minister to interfere in their internal\r\nconcerns. You must therefore either be liberated out of Compliment to\r\nAmerica, or stand your trial, which you have a right to demand.\"\r\n\r\nThis information was so unexpected by me, that I am at a loss how to\r\nanswer it. I know not on what principle it originates; whether from an\r\nidea that I had voluntarily abandoned my Citizenship of America for that\r\nof France, or from any article of the American Constitution applied to\r\nme. The first is untrue with respect to any intention on my part; and\r\nthe second is without foundation, as I shall shew in the course of this\r\nmemorial.\r\n\r\nThe idea of conferring honor of Citizenship upon foreigners, who had\r\ndistinguished themselves in propagating the principles of liberty and\r\nhumanity, in opposition to despotism, war, and bloodshed, was first\r\nproposed by me to La Fayette, at the commencement of the french\r\nrevolution, when his heart appeared to be warmed with those principles.\r\nMy motive in making this proposal, was to render the people of different\r\nnations more fraternal than they had been, or then were. I observed that\r\nalmost every branch of Science had possessed itself of the exercise\r\nof this right, so far as it regarded its own institution. Most of the\r\nAcademies and Societies in Europe, and also those of America, conferred\r\nthe rank of honorary member, upon foreigners eminent in knowledge, and\r\nmade them, in fact, citizens of their literary or scientific republic,\r\nwithout affecting or anyways diminishing their rights of citizenship\r\nin their own country or in other societies: and why the Science of\r\nGovernment should not have the same advantage, or why the people of\r\none nation should not, by their representatives, exercise the right of\r\nconferring the honor of Citizenship upon individuals eminent in another\r\nnation, without affecting _their_ rights of citizenship, is a problem\r\nyet to be solved.\r\n\r\nI now proceed to remark on that part of the letter, in which the writer\r\nsays, that, _from what he can learn from all the late Americans, I\r\nam not considered in America, either by the Government or by the\r\nindividuals, as an American citizen_.\r\n\r\nIn the first place I wish to ask, what is here meant by the Government\r\nof America? The members who compose the Government are only individuals,\r\nwhen in conversation, and who, most probably, hold very different\r\nopinions upon the subject. Have Congress as a body made any declaration\r\nrespecting me, that they now no longer consider me as a citizen? If they\r\nhave not, anything they otherwise say is no more than the opinion\r\nof individuals, and consequently is not legal authority, nor anyways\r\nsufficient authority to deprive any man of his Citizenship. Besides,\r\nwhether a man has forfeited his rights of Citizenship, is a question not\r\ndeterminable by Congress, but by a Court of Judicature and a Jury; and\r\nmust depend upon evidence, and the application of some law or article of\r\nthe Constitution to the case. No such proceeding has yet been had, and\r\nconsequently I remain a Citizen until it be had, be that decision what\r\nit may; for there can be no such thing as a suspension of rights in the\r\ninterim.\r\n\r\nI am very well aware, and always was, of the article of the Constitution\r\nwhich says, as nearly as I can recollect the words, that \"any citizen\r\nof the United States, who shall accept any title, place, or office, from\r\nany foreign king, prince, or state, shall forfeit and lose his right of\r\nCitizenship of the United States.\"\r\n\r\nHad the Article said, that _any citizen of the United States, who shall\r\nbe a member of any foreign convention, for the purpose of forming a free\r\nconstitution, shall forfeit and lose the right of citizenship of the\r\nUnited States_, the article had been directly applicable to me; but\r\nthe idea of such an article never could have entered the mind of the\r\nAmerican Convention, and the present article _is_ altogether foreign\r\nto the case with respect to me. It supposes a Government in active\r\nexistence, and not a Government dissolved; and it supposes a citizen of\r\nAmerica accepting titles and offices under that Government, and not a\r\ncitizen of America who gives his assistance in a Convention chosen by\r\nthe people, for the purpose of forming a Government _de nouveau_ founded\r\non their authority.\r\n\r\nThe late Constitution and Government of France was dissolved the 10th of\r\nAugust, 1792. The National legislative Assembly then in being, supposed\r\nitself without sufficient authority to continue its sittings, and it\r\nproposed to the departments to elect not another legislative Assembly,\r\nbut a Convention for the express purpose of forming a new Constitution.\r\nWhen the Assembly were discoursing on this matter, some of the members\r\nsaid, that they wished to gain all the assistance possible upon the\r\nsubject of free constitutions; and expressed a wish to elect and invite\r\nforeigners of any Nation to the Convention, who had distinguished\r\nthemselves in defending, explaining, and propagating the principles\r\nof liberty. It was on this occasion that my name was mentioned in the\r\nAssembly. (I was then in England.)\r\n\r\n     1 In the American pamphlet a footnote, probably added by\r\n     Bache, here says: \"Even this article does not exist in the\r\n     manner here stated.\" It is a pity Paine did not have in his\r\n     prison the article, which says: \"No person holding any\r\n     office of profit or trust under them [the United States]\r\n     shall, without the consent of Congress, accept of any\r\n     present, emolument, office, or title of any kind whatever,\r\n     from any king, prince, or foreign State.\"--_Editor._\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter this, a deputation from a body of the french people, in order\r\nto remove any objection that might be made against my assisting at the\r\nproposed Convention, requested the Assembly, as their representatives,\r\nto give me the title of French Citizen; after which, I was elected a\r\nmember of the Convention, in four different departments, as is already\r\nknown.(1)\r\n\r\nThe case, therefore, is, that I accepted nothing from any king,\r\nprince, or state, nor from any Government: for France was without any\r\nGovernment, except what arose from common consent, and the necessity of\r\nthe case. Neither did I _make myself a servant of the french Republic_,\r\nas the letter alluded to expresses; for at that time France was not a\r\nrepublic, not even in name. She was altogether a people in a state of\r\nrevolution.\r\n\r\nIt was not until the Convention met that France was declared a republic,\r\nand monarchy abolished; soon after which a committee was elected, of\r\nwhich I was a member,(2) to form a Constitution, which was presented to\r\nthe Convention [and read by Condorcet, who was also a member] the\r\n15th and 16th of February following, but was not to be taken into\r\nconsideration till after the expiration of two months,(3) and if\r\napproved of by the Convention, was then to be referred to the people for\r\ntheir acceptance, with such additions or amendments as the Convention\r\nshould make.\r\n\r\n     1 The deputation referred to was described as the\r\n     \"Commission Extraordinaire,\" in whose name M. Guadet moved\r\n     that the title of French Citizen be conferred on Priestley,\r\n     Paine, Bentham, Wilberforce, Clarkson, Mackintosh, David\r\n     Williams, Cormelle, Paw, Pestalozzi, Washington, Madison,\r\n     Hamilton, Klopstock, Koscinsko, Gorani, Campe, Anacharsis\r\n     Clootz, Gilleers. This was on August 26, and Paine was\r\n     elected by Calais on September 6,1792; and in the same week\r\n     by Oise, Somme, and Puy-de-Dome.--_Editor._\r\n\r\n     2 Sieves, Paine, Brissot, Pétion, Vergniaud, Gensonne,\r\n     Barère, Danton, Condorcet.--_Editor._\r\n\r\n     3 The remainder of this sentence is replaced in the American\r\n     pamphlet by the following: \"The disorders and the\r\n     revolutionary government that took place after this put a\r\n     stop to any further progress upon the case.\"--_Editor._\r\n\r\nIn thus employing myself upon the formation of a Constitution, I\r\ncertainly did nothing inconsistent with the American Constitution. I\r\ntook no oath of allegiance to France, or any other oath whatever. I\r\nconsidered the Citizenship they had presented me with as an honorary\r\nmark of respect paid to me not only as a friend to liberty, but as\r\nan American Citizen. My acceptance of that, or of the deputyship, not\r\nconferred on me by any king, prince, or state, but by a people in a\r\nstate of revolution and contending for liberty, required no transfer of\r\nmy allegiance or of my citizenship from America to France. There I was\r\na real citizen, paying Taxes; here, I was a voluntary friend, employing\r\nmyself on a temporary service. Every American in Paris knew that it was\r\nmy constant intention to return to America, as soon as a constitution\r\nshould be established, and that I anxiously waited for that event.\r\n\r\nI know not what opinions have been circulated in America. It may have\r\nbeen supposed there that I had voluntarily and intentionally abandoned\r\nAmerica, and that my citizenship had ceased by my own choice. I can\r\neasily [believe] there are those in that country who would take such\r\na proceeding on my part somewhat in disgust. The idea of forsaking\r\nold friendships for new acquaintances is not agreeable. I am a little\r\nwarranted in making this supposition by a letter I received some time\r\nago from the wife of one of the Georgia delegates in which she says\r\n\"Your friends on this side the water cannot be reconciled to the idea of\r\nyour abandoning America.\"\r\n\r\nI have never abandoned her in thought, word or deed; and I feel it\r\nincumbent upon me to give this assurance to the friends I have in that\r\ncountry and with whom I have always intended and am determined, if the\r\npossibility exists, to close the scene of my life. It is there that I\r\nhave made myself a home. It is there that I have given the services of\r\nmy best days. America never saw me flinch from her cause in the most\r\ngloomy and perilous of her situations; and I know there are those in\r\nthat country who will not flinch from me. If I have enemies (and every\r\nman has some) I leave them to the enjoyment of their ingratitude.*\r\n\r\n     * I subjoin in a note, for the sake of wasting the solitude\r\n     of a prison, the answer that I gave to the part of the\r\n     letter above mentioned.   It is not inapplacable to the\r\n     subject of this Memorial; but it contain! somewhat of a\r\n     melancholy idea, a little predictive, that I hope is not\r\n     becoming true so soon.\r\n\r\nIt is somewhat extraordinary that the idea of my not being a citizen\r\nof America should have arisen only at the time that I am imprisoned\r\nin France because, or on the pretence that, I am a foreigner. The case\r\ninvolves a strange contradiction of ideas. None of the Americans who\r\ncame to France whilst I was in liberty had conceived any such idea or\r\ncirculated any such opinion; and why it should arise now is a matter\r\nyet to be explained. However discordant the late American Minister G. M.\r\n[Gouverneur Morris] and the late French Committee of Public Safety were,\r\nit suited the purpose of both that I should be continued in arrestation.\r\nThe former wished to prevent my return to America, that I should not\r\nexpose his misconduct; and the latter, lest I should publish to the\r\nworld the history of its wickedness. Whilst that Minister and the\r\nCommittee continued I had no expectation of liberty. I speak here of the\r\nCommittee of which Robespierre was member.(1)\r\n\r\n     \"You touch me on a very tender point when you say that my\r\n     friends on your side the water cannot be reconciled to the\r\n     idea of my abandoning America. They are right. I had rather\r\n     see my horse Button eating the grass of Borden-Town or\r\n     Morrisania than see all the pomp and show of Europe.\r\n\r\n     \"A thousand years hence (for I must indulge a few thoughts)\r\n     perhaps in less, America may be what Europe now is. The\r\n     innocence of her character, that won the hearts of all\r\n     nations in her favour, may sound like a romance and her\r\n     inimitable virtue as if it had never been. The ruin of that\r\n     liberty which thousands bled for or struggled to obtain may\r\n     just furnish materials for a village tale or extort a sigh\r\n     from rustic sensibility, whilst the fashionable of that day,\r\n     enveloped in dissipation, shall deride the principle and\r\n     deny the fact.\r\n\r\n     \"When we contemplate the fall of Empires and the extinction\r\n     of the nations of the Ancient World, we see but little to\r\n     excite our regret than the mouldering ruins of pompous\r\n     palaces, magnificent museums, lofty pyramids and walls and\r\n     towers of the most costly workmanship; but when the Empire\r\n     of America shall fall, the subject for contemplative sorrow\r\n     will be infinitely greater than crumbling brass and marble\r\n     can inspire. It will not then be said, here stood a temple\r\n     of vast antiquity; here rose a babel of invisible height;\r\n     or there a palace of sumptuous extravagance; but here, Ah,\r\n     painful thought! the noblest work of human wisdom, the\r\n     grandest scene of human glory, the fair cause of Freedom\r\n     rose and fell. Read this, and then ask if I forget\r\n     America.\"--Author.\r\n\r\n\r\n     1 This letter, quoted also in Paine's Letter to Washington,\r\n     was written from London, Jan. 6, 1789, to the wife of Col.\r\n     Few, née Kate Nicholson. It is given in full in my \"Life of\r\n     Paine,\" i., p. 247.--_Editor._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MEMORIAL TO MONROE.\r\n\r\nI ever must deny, that the article of the American constitution\r\nalready mentioned, can be applied either verbally, intentionally,\r\nor constructively, to me. It undoubtedly was the intention of the\r\nConvention that framed it, to preserve the purity of the American\r\nrepublic from being debased by foreign and foppish customs; but it never\r\ncould be its intention to act against the principles of liberty, by\r\nforbidding its citizens to assist in promoting those principles in\r\nforeign Countries; neither could it be its intention to act against\r\nthe principles of gratitude.(1) France had aided America in the\r\nestablishment of her revolution, when invaded and oppressed by England\r\nand her auxiliaries. France in her turn was invaded and oppressed by a\r\ncombination of foreign despots. In this situation, I conceived it an act\r\nof gratitude in me, as a citizen of America, to render her in return the\r\nbest services I could perform. I came to France (for I was in England\r\nwhen I received the invitation) not to enjoy ease, emoluments, and\r\nfoppish honours, as the article supposes; but to encounter difficulties\r\nand dangers in defence of liberty; and I much question whether those who\r\nnow malignantly seek (for some I believe do) to turn this to my injury,\r\nwould have had courage to have done the same thing. I am sure Gouverneur\r\nMorris would not. He told me the second day after my arrival, (in\r\nParis,) that the Austrians and Prussians, who were then at Verdun,\r\nwould be in Paris in a fortnight. I have no idea, said he, that seventy\r\nthousand disciplined troops can be stopped in their march by any power\r\nin France.\r\n\r\n     1 This and the two preceding paragraphs, including the\r\n     footnote, are entirely omitted from the American pamphlet.\r\n     It will be seen that Paine had now a suspicion of the\r\n     conspiracy between Gouverneur Morris and those by whom he\r\n     was imprisoned. Soon after his imprisonment he had applied\r\n     to Morris, who replied that he had reclaimed him, and\r\n     enclosed the letter of Deforgues quoted in my Introduction\r\n     to this chapter, of course withholding his own letter to the\r\n     Minister. Paine answered (Feb. 14, 1793): \"You must not\r\n     leave me in the situation in which this letter places me.\r\n     You know I do not deserve it, and you see the unpleasant\r\n     situation in which I am thrown. I have made an answer to the\r\n     Minister's letter, which I wish you to make ground of a\r\n     reply to him. They have nothing against me--except that they\r\n     do not choose I should lie in a state of freedom to write my\r\n     mind freely upon things I have seen. Though you and I are\r\n     not on terms of the best harmony, I apply to you as the\r\n     Minister of America, and you may add to that service\r\n     whatever you think my integrity deserves. At any rate I\r\n     expect you to make Congress acquainted with my situation,\r\n     and to send them copies of the letters that have passed on\r\n     the subject. A reply to the Minister's letter is absolutely\r\n     necessary, were it only to continue the reclamation.\r\n     Otherwise your silence will be a sort of consent to his\r\n     observations.\" Deforgues' \"observations\" having been\r\n     dictated by Morris himself, no reply was sent to him, and no\r\n     word to Congress.--_Editor_.\r\n\r\n     2 In the pamphlet this last clause of the sentence is\r\n     omitted.--_Editor._.\r\n\r\nBesides the reasons I have already given for accepting the invitations\r\nto the Convention, I had another that has reference particularly to\r\nAmerica, and which I mentioned to Mr. Pinckney the night before I left\r\nLondon to come to Paris: \"That it was to the interest of America that\r\nthe system of European governments should be changed and placed on the\r\nsame principle with her own.\" Mr. Pinckney agreed fully in the same\r\nopinion. I have done my part towards it.(1)\r\n\r\nIt is certain that governments upon similar systems agree better\r\ntogether than those that are founded on principles discordant with each\r\nother; and the same rule holds good with respect to the people living\r\nunder them. In the latter case they offend each other by pity, or by\r\nreproach; and the discordancy carries itself to matters of commerce. I\r\nam not an ambitious man, but perhaps I have been an ambitious American.\r\nI have wished to see America the _Mother Church_ of government, and I\r\nhave done my utmost to exalt her character and her condition.\r\n\r\n     1 In the American pamphlet the name of Pinckney (American\r\n     Minister in England) is left blank in this paragraph, and\r\n     the two concluding sentences are omitted from both the\r\n     French and American pamphlets.--_Editor._,\r\n\r\nI have now stated sufficient matter, to shew that the Article in\r\nquestion is not applicable to me; and that any such application to my\r\ninjury, as well in circumstances as in Rights, is contrary both to\r\nthe letter and intention of that Article, and is illegal and\r\nunconstitutional. Neither do I believe that any Jury in America, when\r\nthey are informed of the whole of the case, would give a verdict to\r\ndeprive me of my Rights upon that Article. The citizens of America,\r\nI believe, are not very fond of permitting forced and indirect\r\nexplanations to be put upon matters of this kind. I know not what were\r\nthe merits of the case with respect to the person who was prosecuted for\r\nacting as prize master to a french privateer, but I know that the jury\r\ngave a verdict against the prosecution. The Rights I have acquired\r\nare dear to me. They have been acquired by honourable means, and by\r\ndangerous service in the worst of times, and I cannot passively permit\r\nthem to be wrested from me. I conceive it my duty to defend them, as the\r\ncase involves a constitutional and public question, which is, how\r\nfar the power of the federal government (1) extends, in depriving any\r\ncitizen of his Rights of Citizenship, or of suspending them.\r\n\r\nThat the explanation of National Treaties belongs to Congress is\r\nstrictly constitutional; but not the explanation of the Constitution\r\nitself, any more than the explanation of Law in the case of individual\r\ncitizens. These are altogether Judiciary questions. It is, however,\r\nworth observing, that Congress, in explaining the Article of the Treaty\r\nwith respect to french prizes and french privateers, confined itself\r\nstrictly to the letter of the Article. Let them explain the Article\r\nof the Constitution with respect to me in the same manner, and the\r\ndecision, did it appertain to them, could not deprive me of my Rights of\r\nCitizenship, or suspend them, for I have accepted nothing from any king,\r\nprince, state, or Government.\r\n\r\nYou will please to observe, that I speak as if the federal Government\r\nhad made some declaration upon the subject of my Citizenship; whereas\r\nthe fact is otherwise; and your saying that you have no order respecting\r\nme is a proof of it. Those therefore who propagate the report of my not\r\nbeing considered as a Citizen of America by Government, do it to the\r\nprolongation of my imprisonment, and without authority; for Congress,\r\n_as a government_, has neither decided upon it, nor yet taken the matter\r\ninto consideration; and I request you to caution such persons against\r\nspreading such reports. But be these matters as they may, I cannot have\r\na doubt that you find and feel the case very different, since you have\r\nheard what I have to say, and known what my situation is [better] than\r\nyou did before your arrival.\r\n\r\n     1 In the pamphlet occurs here a significant parenthesis by\r\n     Bache:  \"it should have been said in this case, how far the\r\n     Executive.\"--_Editor._.\r\n\r\nBut it was not the Americans only, but the Convention also, that\r\nknew what my intentions were upon that subject. In my last discourse\r\ndelivered at the Tribune of the Convention, January 19,1793, on the\r\nmotion for suspending the execution of Louis 16th, I said (the Deputy\r\nBancal read the translation in French): \"It unfortunately happens that\r\nthe person who is the subject of the present discussion, is considered\r\nby the Americans as having been the friend of their revolution. His\r\nexecution will be an affliction to them, and it is in your power not\r\nto wound the feelings of your ally. Could I speak the french language I\r\nwould descend to your bar, and in their name become your petitioner to\r\nrespite the execution of the sentence/\"--\"As the convention was elected\r\nfor the express purpose of forming a Constitution, its continuance\r\ncannot be longer than four or five months more at furthest; and if,\r\nafter my _return to America_, I should employ myself in writing the\r\nhistory of the french Revolution, I had rather record a thousand\r\nerrors on the side of mercy, than be obliged to tell one act of severe\r\nJustice.\"--\"Ah Citizens! give not the tyrant of England the triumph\r\nof seeing the man perish on a scaffold who had aided my much-loved\r\nAmerica.\"\r\n\r\nDoes this look as if I had abandoned America? But if she abandons me\r\nin the situation I am in, to gratify the enemies of humanity, let that\r\ndisgrace be to herself. But I know the people of America better than to\r\nbelieve it,(1) tho' I undertake not to answer for every individual.\r\n\r\nWhen this discourse was pronounced, Marat launched himself into the\r\nmiddle of the hall and said that \"I voted against the punishment of\r\ndeath because I was a quaker.\" I replied that \"I voted against it both\r\nmorally and politically.\"\r\n\r\n     1 In the French pamphlet: \"pour jamais lui prêter du tels\r\n     sentiments.\"\r\n\r\nI certainly went a great way, considering the rage of the times, in\r\nendeavouring to prevent that execution. I had many reasons for so doing.\r\nI judged, and events have shewn that I judged rightly, that if they once\r\nbegan shedding blood, there was no knowing where it would end; and as\r\nto what the world might call _honour_ the execution would appear like a\r\nnation killing a mouse; and in a political view, would serve to transfer\r\nthe hereditary claim to some more formidable Enemy. The man could do no\r\nmore mischief; and that which he had done was not only from the vice of\r\nhis education, but was as much the fault of the Nation in restoring\r\nhim after he had absconded June 21st, 1791, as it was his. I made\r\nthe proposal for imprisonment until the end of the war and perpetual\r\nbanishment after the war, instead of the punishment of death. Upwards of\r\nthree hundred members voted for that proposal. The sentence for absolute\r\ndeath (for some members had voted the punishment of death conditionally)\r\nwas carried by a majority of twenty-five out of more than seven hundred.\r\n\r\nI return from this digression to the proper subject of my memorial.(1)\r\n\r\n     1 This and the preceding five paragraphs, and five following\r\n     the nest, are omitted from the American pamphlet.--\r\n     _Editor._.\r\n\r\nPainful as the want of liberty may be, it is a consolation to me to\r\nbelieve, that my imprisonment proves to the world, that I had no share\r\nin the murderous system that then reigned. That I was an enemy to it,\r\nboth morally and politically, is known to all who had any knowledge of\r\nme; and could I have written french as well as I can English, I would\r\npublicly have exposed its wickedness and shewn the ruin with which it\r\nwas pregnant. They who have esteemed me on former occasions, whether in\r\nAmerica or in Europe will, I know, feel no cause to abate that esteem,\r\nwhen they reflect, that _imprisonment with preservation of character is\r\npreferable to liberty with disgrace_.\r\n\r\nI here close my Memorial and proceed to offer you a proposal that\r\nappears to me suited to all the circumstances of the case; which is,\r\nthat you reclaim me conditionally, until the opinion of Congress can be\r\nobtained on the subject of my citizenship of America; and that I remain\r\nin liberty under your protection during that time.\r\n\r\nI found this proposal upon the following grounds.\r\n\r\nFirst, you say you have no orders respecting me; consequently, you\r\nhave no orders _not_ to reclaim me; and in this case you are left\r\ndiscretionary judge whether to reclaim or not. My proposal therefore\r\nunites a consideration of your situation with my own.\r\n\r\nSecondly, I am put in arrestation because I am a foreigner. It is\r\ntherefore necessary to determine to what country I belong. The right of\r\ndetermining this question cannot appertain exclusively to the Committee\r\nof Public Safety or General Surety; because I appeal to the Minister of\r\nthe United States, and show that my citizenship of that country is good\r\nand valid, referring at the same time, thro' the agency of the Minister,\r\nmy claim of right to the opinion of Congress. It being a matter between\r\ntwo Governments.\r\n\r\nThirdly. France does not claim me fora citizen; neither do I set up any\r\nclaim of citizenship in France. The question is simply, whether I am\r\nor am not a citizen of America. I am imprisoned here on the decree for\r\nimprisoning foreigners, because, say they, I was born in England. I\r\nsay in answer that, though born in England, I am not a subject of the\r\nEnglish Government any more than any other American who was born, as\r\nthey all were, under the same Government, or than the Citizens of France\r\nare subjects of the French Monarchy under which they were born. I have\r\ntwice taken the oath of abjuration to the British King and Government\r\nand of Allegiance to America,--once as a citizen of the State of\r\nPennsylvania in 1776, and again before Congress, administered to me by\r\nthe President, Mr. Hancock, when I was appointed Secretary in the Office\r\nof Foreign Affairs in 1777.\r\n\r\nThe letter before quoted in the first page of this memorial, says, \"It\r\nwould be out of character for an American minister to interfere in the\r\ninternal affairs of France.\" This goes on the idea that I am a citizen\r\nof France, and a member of the Convention, which is not the fact. The\r\nConvention have declared me to be a foreigner; and consequently the\r\ncitizenship and the election are null and void.(1) It also has the\r\nappearance of a Decision, that the article of the Constitution,\r\nrespecting grants made to American Citizens by foreign kings, princes,\r\nor states, is applicable to me; which is the very point in question,\r\nand against the application of which I contend. I state evidence to the\r\nMinister, to shew that I am not within the letter or meaning of that\r\nArticle; that it cannot operate against me; and I apply to him for the\r\nprotection that I conceive I have a right to ask and to receive. The\r\ninternal affairs of France are out of the question with respect to my\r\napplication or his interference. I ask it not as a citizen of France,\r\nfor I am not one: I ask it not as a member of the Convention, for I am\r\nnot one; both these, as before said, have been rendered null and void;\r\nI ask it not as a man against whom there is any accusation, for there\r\nis none; I ask it not as an exile from America, whose liberties I\r\nhave honourably and generously contributed to establish; I ask it as a\r\nCitizen of America, deprived of his liberty in France, under the plea of\r\nbeing a foreigner; and I ask it because I conceive I am entitled to it,\r\nupon every principle of Constitutional Justice and National honour.(2)\r\n\r\n     1 In the pamphlet: \"The Convention included me in the vote\r\n     for dismissing foreigners from the Convention, and the\r\n     Committees imprisoned me as a foreigner.\"--_Editor._\r\n\r\n     2 All  previous editions of the pamphlet end with this\r\n     word.--_Editor._\r\n\r\nBut tho' I thus positively assert my claim because I believe I have a\r\nright to do so, it is perhaps most eligible, in the present situation\r\nof things, to put that claim upon the footing I have already mentioned;\r\nthat is, that the Minister reclaims me conditionally until the opinion\r\nof Congress can be obtained on the subject of my citizenship of America,\r\nand that I remain in liberty under the protection of the Minister during\r\nthat interval.\r\n\r\nN. B. I should have added that as Gouverneur Morris could not inform\r\nCongress of the cause of my arrestation, as he knew it not himself, it\r\nis to be supposed that Congress was not enough acquainted with the case\r\nto give any directions respecting me when you came away.\r\n\r\nT.P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDENDA.\r\n\r\nLetters, hitherto unpublished, written by Paine to Monroe before his\r\nrelease on November 4., 1794.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Luxembourg Mem Vendemaire, Old Style Oct 4th 1794\r\n\r\nDear Sir: I thank you for your very friendly and affectionate letter of\r\nthe 18th September which I did not receive till this morning.(1) It has\r\nrelieved my mind from a load of disquietude. You will easily suppose\r\nthat if the information I received had been exact, my situation was\r\nwithout hope. I had in that case neither section, department nor\r\nCountry, to reclaim me; but that is not all, I felt a poignancy of\r\ngrief, in having the least reason to suppose that America had so soon\r\nforgotten me who had never forgotten her.\r\n\r\nMr. Labonadaire, in a note of yesterday, directed me to write to the\r\nConvention. As I suppose this measure has been taken in concert with\r\nyou, I have requested him to shew you the letter, of which he will make\r\na translation to accompany the original.\r\n\r\n(I cannot see what motive can induce them to keep me in prison. It\r\nwill gratify the English Government and afflict the friends I have in\r\nAmerica. The supporters of the system of Terror might apprehend that if\r\nI was in liberty and in America I should publish the history of their\r\ncrimes, but the present persons who have overset that immoral System\r\nought to have no such apprehension. On the contrary, they ought to\r\nconsider me as one of themselves, at least as one of their friends. Had\r\nI been an insignificant character I had not been in arrestation. It was\r\nthe literary and philosophical reputation I had gained, in the world,\r\nthat made them my Enemies; and I am the victim of the principles, and\r\nif I may be permitted to say it, of the talents, that procured me the\r\nesteem of America. My character is the _secret_ of my arrestation.)\r\n\r\n     1 Printed in the letter to Washington, chap. XXII. The delay\r\n     of sixteen days in Monroe's letter was probably due to the\r\n     manouvres of Paine's enemies on the Committee of Public\r\n     Safety. He was released only after their removal from the\r\n     Committee, and the departure of Gouverneur Morris.--\r\n     _Editor._,\r\n\r\nIf the letter I have written be not covered by other authority than my\r\nown it will have no effect, for they already know all that I can say. On\r\nwhat ground do they pretend to deprive America of the service of any\r\nof her citizens without assigning a cause, or only the flimsy one of\r\nmy being born in England? Gates, were he here, might be arrested on the\r\nsame pretence, and he and Burgoyne be confounded together.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult for me to give an opinion, but among other things\r\nthat occur to me, I think that if you were to say that, as it will be\r\nnecessary to you to inform the Government of America of my situation,\r\nyou require an explanation with the Committee upon that subject; that\r\nyou are induced to make this proposal not only out of esteem for the\r\ncharacter of the person who is the personal object of it, but because\r\nyou know that his arrestation will distress the Americans, and the more\r\nso as it will appear to them to be contrary to their ideas of civil and\r\nnational justice, it might perhaps have some effect. If the Committee\r\n[of Public Safety] will do nothing, it will be necessary to bring this\r\nmatter openly before the Convention, for I do most sincerely assure you,\r\nfrom the observations that I hear, and I suppose the same are made in\r\nother places, that the character of America lies under some reproach.\r\nAll the world knows that I have served her, and they see that I am still\r\nin prison; and you know that when people can form a conclusion upon a\r\nsimple fact, they trouble not themselves about reasons. I had rather\r\nthat America cleared herself of all suspicion of ingratitude, though I\r\nwere to be the victim.\r\n\r\nYou advise me to have patience, but I am fully persuaded that the longer\r\nI continue in prison the more difficult will be my liberation. There\r\nare two reasons for this: the one is that the present Committee, by\r\ncontinuing so long my imprisonment, will naturally suppose that my mind\r\nwill be soured against them, as it was against those who put me in, and\r\nthey will continue my imprisonment from the same apprehensions as the\r\nformer Committee did; the other reason is, that it is now about two\r\nmonths since your arrival, and I am still in prison. They will explain\r\nthis into an indifference upon my fate that will encourage them to\r\ncontinue my imprisonment. When I hear some people say that it is the\r\nGovernment of America that now keeps me in prison by not reclaiming me,\r\nand then pour forth a volley of execrations against her, I know not\r\nhow to answer them otherwise than by a direct denial which they do not\r\nappear to believe. You will easily conclude that whatever relates to\r\nimprisonments and liberations makes a topic of prison conversation;\r\nand as I am now the oldest inhabitant within these walls, except two\r\nor three, I am often the subject of their remarks, because from the\r\ncontinuance of my imprisonment they auger ill to themselves. You see I\r\nwrite you every thing that occurs to me, and I conclude with thanking\r\nyou again for your very friendly and affectionate letter, and am with\r\ngreat respect,\r\n\r\nYour's affectionately,\r\n\r\nThomas Paine.\r\n\r\n(To day is the anniversary of the action at German Town. [October 4,\r\n1777.] Your letter has enabled me to contradict the observations before\r\nmentioned.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Oct 13, 1794 Dear Sir: On the 28th of this Month (October) I shall\r\nhave suffered ten months imprisonment, to the dishonour of America as\r\nwell as of myself, and I speak to you very honestly when I say that my\r\npatience is exhausted. It is only my actual liberation that can make me\r\nbelieve it. Had any person told me that I should remain in prison two\r\nmonths after the arrival of a new Minister, I should have supposed that\r\nhe meant to affront me as an American. By the friendship and sympathy\r\nyou express in your letter you seem to consider my imprisonment as\r\nhaving connection only with myself, but I am certain that the inferences\r\nthat follow from it have relation also to the National character of\r\nAmerica, I already feel this in myself, for I no longer speak with pride\r\nof being a citizen of that country. Is it possible Sir that I should,\r\nwhen I am suffering unjust imprisonment under the very eye of her new\r\nMinister?\r\n\r\nWhile there was no Minister here (for I consider Morris as none) nobody\r\nwondered at my imprisonment, but now everybody wonders. The continuance\r\nof it under a change of diplomatic circumstances, subjects me to the\r\nsuspicion of having merited it, and also to the suspicion of having\r\nforfeited my reputation with America; and it subjects her at the same\r\ntime to the suspicion of ingratitude, or to the reproach of wanting\r\nnational or diplomatic importance. The language that some Americans\r\nhave held of my not being considered as an American citizen, tho'\r\ncontradicted by yourself, proceeds, I believe, from no other motive,\r\nthan the shame and dishonour they feel at the imprisonment of a\r\nfellow-citizen, and they adopt this apology, at my expence, to get rid\r\nof that disgrace. Is it not enough that I suffer imprisonment, but my\r\nmind also must be wounded and tortured with subjects of this kind? Did I\r\nreason from personal considerations only, independent of principles and\r\nthe pride of having practiced those principles honourably, I should be\r\ntempted to curse the day I knew America. By contributing to her liberty\r\nI have lost my own, and yet her Government beholds my situation in\r\nsilence. Wonder not, Sir, at the ideas I express or the language in\r\nwhich I express them. If I have a heart to feel for others I can feel\r\nalso for myself, and if I have anxiety for my own honour, I have it also\r\nfor a country whose suffering infancy I endeavoured to nourish and\r\nto which I have been enthusiastically attached. As to patience I have\r\npracticed it long--as long as it was honorable to do so, and when it\r\ngoes beyond that point it becomes meanness.\r\n\r\nI am inclined to believe that you have attended to my imprisonment\r\nmore as a friend than as a Minister. As a friend I thank you for your\r\naffectionate attachment. As a Minister you have to look beyond me to the\r\nhonour and reputation of your Government; and your Countrymen, who have\r\naccustomed themselves to consider any subject in one line of thinking\r\nonly, more especially if it makes a strong [impression] upon them, as\r\nI believe my situation has made upon you, do not immediately see the\r\nmatters that have relation to it in another line; and it is to bring\r\nthese two into one point that I offer you these observations. A citizen\r\nand his country, in a case like mine, are so closely connected that the\r\ncase of one is the case of both.\r\n\r\nWhen you first arrived the path you had to pursue with respect to my\r\nliberation was simple. I was imprisoned as a foreigner; you knew that\r\nforeigner to be a citizen of America, and you knew also his character,\r\nand as such you should immediately have reclaimed him. You could lose\r\nnothing by taking strong ground, but you might lose much by taking an\r\ninferior one; but instead of this, which I conceive would have been the\r\nright line of acting, you left me in their hands on the loose intimation\r\nthat my liberation would take place without your direct interference,\r\nand you strongly recommended it to me to wait the issue. This is more\r\nthan seven weeks ago and I am still in prison. I suspect these people\r\nare trifling with you, and if they once believe they can do that, you\r\nwill not easily get any business done except what they wish to have\r\ndone.\r\n\r\nWhen I take a review of my whole situation--my circumstances ruined,\r\nmy health half destroyed, my person imprisoned, and the prospect of\r\nimprisonment still staring me in the face, can you wonder at the\r\nagony of my feelings? You lie down in safety and rise to plenty; it\r\nis otherwise with me; I am deprived of more than half the common\r\nnecessaries of life; I have not a candle to burn and cannot get one.\r\nFuel can be procured only in small quantities and that with great\r\ndifficulty and very dear, and to add to the rest, I am fallen into a\r\nrelapse and am again on the sick list. Did you feel the whole force of\r\nwhat I suffer, and the disgrace put upon America by this injustice done\r\nto one of her best and most affectionate citizens, you would not, either\r\nas a friend or Minister, rest a day till you had procured my liberation.\r\nIt is the work of two or three hours when you set heartily about\r\nit, that is, when you demand me as an American citizen, or propose a\r\nconference with the Committee upon that subject; or you may make it the\r\nwork of a twelve-month and not succeed. I know these people better than\r\nyou do.\r\n\r\nYou desire me to believe that \"you are placed here on a difficult\r\nTheatre with many important objects to attend to, and with but few to\r\nconsult with, and that it becomes you in pursuit of these to regulate\r\nyour conduct with respect to each, as to manner and time, as will in\r\nyour judgment be best calculated to accomplish the whole.\" As I know\r\nnot what these objects are I can say nothing to that point. But I have\r\nalways been taught to believe that the liberty of a Citizen was the\r\nfirst object of all free Governments, and that it ought not to give\r\npreference to, or be blended with, any other. It is that public object\r\nthat all the world can see, and which obtains an influence upon public\r\nopinion more than any other. This is not the case with the objects you\r\nallude to. But be those objects what they may, can you suppose you will\r\naccomplish them the easier by holding me in the back-ground, or making\r\nme only an accident in the negotiation? Those with whom you confer will\r\nconclude from thence that you do not feel yourself very strong upon\r\nthose points, and that you politically keep me out of sight in the\r\nmeantime to make your approach the easier.\r\n\r\nThere is one part in your letter that is equally as proper should be\r\ncommunicated to the Committee as to me, and which I conceive you are\r\nunder some diplomatic obligation to do. It is that part which you\r\nconclude by saying that \"_to the welfare of Thomas Paine the Americans\r\nare not and cannot be indifferent_.\" As it is impossible the Americans\r\ncan preserve their esteem for me and for my oppressors at the same\r\ntime, the injustice to me strikes at the popular part of the Treaty of\r\nAlliance. If it be the wish of the Committee to reduce the treaty to a\r\nmere skeleton of Government forms, they are taking the right method to\r\ndo it, and it is not improbable they will blame you afterwards for not\r\nin-forming them upon the subject. The disposition to retort has been so\r\nnotorious here, that you ought to be guarded against it at all points.\r\n\r\nYou say in your letter that you doubt whether the gentleman who informed\r\nme of the language held by some Americans respecting my citizenship of\r\nAmerica conveyed even his own ideas clearly upon the subject.(1) I know\r\nnot how this may be, but I believe he told me the truth. I received a\r\nletter a few days ago from a friend and former comrade of mine in which\r\nhe tells me, that all the Americans he converses with, say, that\r\nI should have been in liberty long ago if the Minister could have\r\nreclaimed me as an American citizen. When I compare this with the\r\ncounter-declarations in your letter I can explain the case no otherwise\r\nthan I have already done, that it is an apology to get rid of the shame\r\nand dishonour they feel at the imprisonment of an American citizen,\r\nand because they are not willing it should be supposed there is want\r\nof influence in the American Embassy. But they ought to see that this\r\nlanguage is injurious to me.\r\n\r\nOn the 2d of this month Vendemaire I received a line from Mr. Beresford\r\nin which he tells me I shall be in liberty in two or three days, and\r\nthat he has this from good authority. On the 12th I received a note from\r\nMr. Labonadaire, written at the Bureau of the Concierge, in which he\r\ntells me of the interest you take in procuring my liberation, and that\r\nafter the steps that had been already taken that I ought to write to the\r\nConvention to demand my liberty _purely and simply_ as a citizen of the\r\nUnited States of America. He advised me to send the letter to him, and\r\nhe would translate it. I sent the letter inclosing at the same time\r\na letter to you. I have heard nothing since of the letter to the\r\nConvention. On the 17th I received a letter from my former comrade\r\nVanhuele, in which he says \"I am just come from Mr. Russell who had\r\nyesterday a conversation with your Minister and your liberation is\r\ncertain--you will be in liberty to-morrow.\" Vanhuele also adds, \"I find\r\nthe advice of Mr. Labonadaire good, for tho' you have some enemies in\r\nthe Convention, the strongest and best part are in your favour.\" But\r\nthe case is, and I felt it whilst I was writing the letter to the\r\nConvention, that there is an awkwardness in my appearing, you being\r\npresent; for every foreigner should apply thro' his Minister, or rather\r\nhis Minister for him.\r\n\r\n     1 The letter of Peter Whiteside, quoted at the beginning of\r\n     the Memorial. See introduction to the Memorial. It would\r\n     seem from this whole letter that it was not known by\r\n     Americans in Paris that Monroe had been kept ont of his\r\n     office by Morris for nearly a month after his arrival in\r\n     Paris.--_Editor._\r\n\r\nWhen I thus see day after day and month after month, and promise after\r\npromise, pass away without effect, what can I conclude but that either\r\nthe Committees are secretly determined not to let me go, or that the\r\nmeasures you take are not pursued with the vigor necessary to give them\r\neffect; or that the American National character is without sufficient\r\nimportance in the French Republic? The latter will be gratifying to\r\nthe English Government. In short, Sir, the case is now arrived to that\r\ncrisis, that for the sake of your own reputation as a Minister you ought\r\nto require a positive answer from the Committee. As to myself, it is\r\nmore agreeable to me now to contemplate an honourable destruction, and\r\nto perish in the act of protesting against the injustice I suffer,\r\nand to caution the people of America against confiding too much in the\r\nTreaty of Alliance, violated as it has been in every principle, and in\r\nmy imprisonment though an American Citizen, than remain in the wretched\r\ncondition I am. I am no longer of any use to the world or to myself.\r\n\r\nThere was a time when I beheld the Revolution of the 10th. Thermidor\r\n[the fall of Robespierre] with enthusiasm. It was the first news\r\nmy comrade Vanhuele communicated to me during my illness, and it\r\ncontributed to my recovery. But there is still something rotten at the\r\nCenter, and the Enemies that I have, though perhaps not numerous, are\r\nmore active than my friends. If I form a wrong opinion of men or things\r\nit is to you I must look to set me right. You are in possession of the\r\nsecret. I know nothing of it. But that I may be guarded against as many\r\nwants as possible I shall set about writing a memorial to Congress,\r\nanother to the State of Pennsylvania, and an address to the people of\r\nAmerica; but it will be difficult for me to finish these until I know\r\nfrom yourself what applications you have made for my liberation, and\r\nwhat answers you have received.\r\n\r\nAh, Sir, you would have gotten a load of trouble and difficulties off\r\nyour hands that I fear will multiply every day, had you made it a point\r\nto procure my liberty when you first arrived, and not left me floating\r\non the promises of men whom you did not know. You were then a new\r\ncharacter. You had come in consequence of their own request that Morris\r\nshould be recalled; and had you then, before you opened any subject\r\nof negociation that might arise into controversy, demanded my liberty\r\neither as a Civility or as a Right I see not how they could have refused\r\nit.\r\n\r\nI have already said that after all the promises that have been made I\r\nam still in prison. I am in the dark upon all the matters that relate\r\nto myself. I know not if it be to the Convention, to the Committee of\r\nPublic Safety, of General Surety, or to the deputies who come\r\nsometimes to the Luxembourg to examine and put persons in liberty, that\r\napplications have been made for my liberation. But be it to whom it\r\nmay, my earnest and pressing request to you as Minister is that you\r\nwill bring this matter to a conclusion by reclaiming me as an American\r\ncitizen imprisoned in France under the plea of being a foreigner born in\r\nEngland; that I may know the result, and how to prepare the Memorials\r\nI have mentioned, should there be occasion for them. The right of\r\ndetermining who are American citizens can belong only to America. The\r\nConvention have declared I am not a French Citizen because she has\r\ndeclared me to be a foreigner, and have by that declaration cancelled\r\nand annulled the vote of the former assembly that conferred the Title\r\nof Citizen upon Citizens or subjects of other Countries. I should not be\r\nhonest to you nor to myself were I not to express myself as I have done\r\nin this letter, and I confide and request you will accept it in that\r\nsense and in no other.\r\n\r\nI am, with great respect, your suffering fellow-citizen,\r\n\r\nThomas Paine.\r\n\r\nP. S.--If my imprisonment is to continue, and I indulge very little hope\r\nto the contrary, I shall be under the absolute necessity of applying\r\nto you for a supply of several articles. Every person here have their\r\nfamilies or friends upon the spot who make provision for them. This is\r\nnot the case with me; I have no person I can apply to but the American\r\nMinister, and I can have no doubt that if events should prevent\r\nmy repaying the expence Congress or the State of Pennsylvania will\r\ndischarge it for me.\r\n\r\nTo day is 22 Vendemaire Monday October 13, but you will not receive this\r\nletter till the 14th. I will send the bearer to you again on the 15th,\r\nWednesday, and I will be obliged to you to send me for the present,\r\nthree or four candles, a little sugar of any kind, and some soap for\r\nshaving; and I should be glad at the same time to receive a line from\r\nyou and a memorandum of the articles. Were I in your place I would order\r\na Hogshead of Sugar, some boxes of Candles and Soap from America, for\r\nthey will become still more scarce. Perhaps the best method for you\r\nto procure them at present is by applying to the American Consuls at\r\nBordeaux and Havre, and have them up by the diligence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3. [Undated.]\r\n\r\nDear Sir: As I have not yet received any answer to my last, I have\r\namused myself with writing you the inclosed memoranda. Though\r\nyou recommend patience to me I cannot but feel very pointedly the\r\nuncomfortableness of my situation, and among other reflections that\r\noccur to me I cannot think that America receives any credit from the\r\nlong imprisonment that I suffer. It has the appearance of neglecting\r\nher citizens and her friends and of encouraging the insults of foreign\r\nnations upon them, and upon her commerce. My imprisonment is as well\r\nand perhaps more known in England than in France, and they (the English)\r\nwill not be intimidated from molesting an American ship when they see\r\nthat one of her best citizens (for I have a right to call myself so) can\r\nbe imprisoned in another country at the mere discretion of a Committee,\r\nbecause he is a foreigner.\r\n\r\nWhen you first arrived every body congratulated me that I should soon,\r\nif not immediately, be in liberty. Since that time about two hundred\r\nhave been set free from this prison on the applications of their\r\nsections or of individuals--and I am continually hurt by the\r\nobservations that are made--\"that a section in Paris has more influence\r\nthan America.\"\r\n\r\nIt is right that I furnish you with these circumstances. It is the\r\neffect of my anxiety that the character of America suffer no reproach;\r\nfor the world knows that I have acted a generous duty by her. I am the\r\nthird American that has been imprisoned. Griffiths nine weeks, Haskins\r\nabout five, and myself eight [months] and yet in prison. With respect\r\nto the two former there was then no Minister, for I consider Morris as\r\nnone; and they were liberated on the applications of the Americans in\r\nParis. As to myself I had rather be publicly and honorably reclaimed,\r\ntho' the reclamation was refused, than remain in the uncertain situation\r\nthat I am. Though my health has suffered my spirits are not broken. I\r\nhave nothing to fear unless innocence and fortitude be crimes. America,\r\nwhatever may be my fate, will have no cause to blush for me as a\r\ncitizen; I hope I shall have none to blush for her as a country. If, my\r\ndear Sir, there is any-thing in the perplexity of ideas I have mistaken,\r\nonly suppose yourself in my situation, and you will easily find an\r\nexcuse for it. I need not say how much I shall rejoice to pay my\r\nrespects to you without-side the walls of this prison, and to enquire\r\nafter my American friends. But I know that nothing can be\r\naccomplished here but by unceasing perseverance and application. Yours\r\naffectionately.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4. October 20, 1794.\r\n\r\nDear Sir: I recd. your friendly letter of the 26 Vendemaire on the day\r\nit was written, and I thank you for communicating to me your opinion\r\nupon my case. Ideas serve to beget ideas, and as it is from a review of\r\nevery thing that can be said upon a subject, or is any ways connected\r\nwith it, that the best judgment can be formed how to proceed, I present\r\nyou with such ideas as occur to me. I am sure of one thing, which is\r\nthat you will give them a patient and attentive perusal.\r\n\r\nYou say in your letter that \"I must be sensible that although I am an\r\nAmerican citizen, yet if you interfere in my behalf as the Minister of\r\nmy country you must demand my liberation only in case there be no charge\r\nagainst me; and that if there is I must be brought to trial previously,\r\nsince no person in a _private_ character can be exempt from the laws of\r\nthe country in which he resides.\"--This is what I have twice attempted\r\nto do. I wrote a letter on the 3d Sans Culottodi(1) to the Deputies,\r\nmembers of the Committee of Surety General, who came to the Luxembourg\r\nto examine the persons detained. The letter was as follows:--\"Citizens\r\nRepresentatives: I offer myself for examination. Justice is due to every\r\nMan. It is Justice only that I ask.--Thomas Paine.\"\r\n\r\nAs I was not called for examination, nor heard anything in consequence\r\nof my letter the first time of sending it, I sent a duplicate of it a\r\nfew days after. It was carried to them by my good friend and comrade\r\nVanhuele, who was then going in liberty, having been examined the day\r\nbefore. Vanhuele wrote me on the next day and said: \"Bourdon de l'Oise\r\n[who was one of the examining Deputies] is the most inveterate enemy you\r\ncan have. The answer he gave me when I presented your letter put me in\r\nsuch a passion with him that I expected I should be sent back again\r\nto prison.\" I then wrote a third letter but had not an opportunity of\r\nsending it, as Bourdon did not come any more till after I received Mr.\r\nLabonadaire's letter advising me to write to the Convention. The letter\r\nwas as follows:--\"Citizens, I have twice offered myself for examination,\r\nand I chose to do this while Bourdon de l'Oise was one of the\r\nCommissioners.\r\n\r\n     1 Festival of Labour, September 19, 1794.--_Editor._.\r\n\r\nThis Deputy has said in the Convention that I intrigued with an ancient\r\nagent of the Bureau of Foreign Affairs. My examination therefore while\r\nhe is present will give him an opportunity of proving his charge or of\r\nconvincing himself of his error. If Bourdon de l'Oise is an honest man\r\nhe will examine me, but lest he should not I subjoin the following. That\r\nwhich B[ourdon] calls an intrigue was at the request of a member of the\r\nformer Committee of Salut Public, last August was a twelvemonth. I met\r\nthe member on the Boulevard. He asked me something in French which I\r\ndid not understand and we went together to the Bureau of Foreign Affairs\r\nwhich was near at hand. The Agent (Otto, whom you probably knew in\r\nAmerica) served as interpreter, The member (it was Barère) then asked\r\nme 1st, If I could furnish him with the plan of Constitution I had\r\npresented to the Committee of Constitution of which I was member with\r\nhimself, because, he said, it contained several things which he\r\nwished had been adopted: 2dly, He asked me my opinion upon sending\r\nCommissioners to the United States of America: 3dly, If fifty or an\r\nhundred ship loads of flour could be procured from America. As verbal\r\ninterpretation was tedious, it was agreed that I should give him my\r\nopinion in writing, and that the Agent [Otto] should translate it, which\r\nhe did. I answered the first question by sending him the plan [of\r\na Constitution] which he still has. To the second, I replied that\r\nI thought it would be proper to send Commissioners, because that in\r\nRevolutions circumstances change so fast that it was often necessary\r\nto send a better supply of information to an Ally than could be\r\ncommunicated by writing; and that Congress had done the same thing\r\nduring the American War; and I gave him some information that the\r\nCommissioners would find useful on their arrival. I answered the third\r\nquestion by sending him a list of American exports two years before,\r\ndistinguishing the several articles by which he would see that the\r\nsupply he mentioned could be obtained. I sent him also the plan of Paul\r\nJones, giving it as his, for procuring salt-petre, which was to send\r\na squadron (it did not require a large one) to take possession of the\r\nIsland of St. Helen's, to keep the English flag flying at the port,\r\nthat the English East India ships coming from the East Indies, and that\r\nballast with salt-petre, might be induced to enter as usual; And that it\r\nwould be a considerable time before the English Government could know\r\nof what had happened at St. Helen's. See here what Bourdon de l'Oise has\r\ncalled an intrigue.--If it was an intrigue it was between a Committee of\r\nSalut Public and myself, for the Agent was no more than the interpreter\r\nand translator, and the object of the intrigue was to furnish France\r\nwith flour and salt-petre.\"--I suppose Bourdon had heard that the agent\r\nand I were seen together talking English, and this was enough for _him_\r\nto found his charge upon.(1)\r\n\r\nYou next say that \"I must likewise be sensible that although I am an\r\nAmerican citizen that it is likewise believed there [in America] that\r\nI am become a citizen of France, and that in consequence this latter\r\ncharacter has so far [illegible] the former as to weaken if not destroy\r\nany claim you might have to interpose in my behalf.\" I am sorry I cannot\r\nadd any new arguments to those I have already advanced on this part of\r\nthe subject. But I cannot help asking myself, and I wish you would\r\nask the Committee, if it could possibly be the intention of France to\r\n_kidnap_ citizens from America under the pretence of dubbing them\r\nwith the title of French citizens, and then, after inviting or rather\r\nenveigling them into France, make it a pretence for detaining them? If\r\nit was, (which I am sure it was not, tho' they now act as if it was) the\r\ninsult was to America, tho' the injury was to me, and the treachery was\r\nto both.\r\n\r\n     1 The communications of Paine to Barère are given in my\r\n     \"Life of Paine,\" vol. ii-i PP. 73, 87. Otto was Secretary to\r\n     the Minister of Foreign Affairs when he acted as interpreter\r\n     between Paine and Barère. There was never any charge at all\r\n     made against Paine, as the Archives of France now prove,\r\n     save that he was a \"foreigner.\" Paine was of coarse ignorant\r\n     of the conspiracy between Morris and Deforgues which had\r\n     imprisoned him. Bourdon de l'Oise, one of the most cruel\r\n     Jacobins and Terrorists, afterwards conspired with Pichegru\r\n     to overthrow the Republic, and was with him banished (1797)\r\n     to Sinamari, South America, where he died soon after his\r\n     arrival.--_Editor._.\r\n\r\nDid they mean to kidnap General Washington, Mr. Madison, and several\r\nother Americans whom they dubbed with the same title as well as me? Let\r\nany man look at the condition of France when I arrived in it,--invaded\r\nby Austrians and Prussians and declared to be in danger,--and then ask\r\nif any man who had a home and a country to go to, as I had in America,\r\nwould have come amongst them from any other motive than of assisting\r\nthem. If I could possibly have supposed them capable of treachery\r\nI certainly would not have trusted myself in their power. Instead\r\ntherefore of your being unwilling or apprehensive of meeting the\r\nquestion of French citizenship, they ought to be ashamed of advancing\r\nit, and this will be the case unless you admit their arguments or\r\nobjections too passively. It is a case on their part fit only for\r\nthe continuations of Robespierre to set up. As to the name of French\r\ncitizen, I never considered it in any other light, so far as regarded\r\nmyself, than as a token of honorary respect. I never made them any\r\npromise nor took any oath of allegiance or of citizenship, nor bound\r\nmyself by an act or means whatever to the performance of any thing.\r\nI acted altogether as a friend invited among them as I supposed on\r\nhonorable terms. I did not come to join myself to a Government already\r\nformed, but to assist in forming one _de nouveau_, which was afterwards\r\nto be submitted to the people whether they would accept it or not, and\r\nthis any foreigner might do. And strictly speaking there are no citizens\r\nbefore this is a government. They are all of the People. The Americans\r\nwere not called citizens till after Government was established, and not\r\neven then until they had taken the oath of allegiance. This was the\r\ncase in Pennsylvania. But be this French citizenship more or less, the\r\nConvention have swept it away by declaring me to be a foreigner, and\r\nimprisoning me as such; and this is a short answer to all those who\r\naffect to say or to believe that I am French Citizen. A Citizen without\r\nCitizenship is a term non-descript.\r\n\r\nAfter the two preceeding paragraphs you ask--\"If it be my wish that you\r\nshould embark in this controversy (meaning that of reclaiming me)\r\nand risque the consequences with respect to myself and the good\r\nunderstanding subsisting between the two countries, or, without\r\nrelinquishing any point of right, and which might be insisted on in\r\ncase of extremities, pursue according to your best judgment and with the\r\nlight before you, the object of my liberation?\"\r\n\r\nAs I believe from the apparent obstinacy of the Committees that\r\ncircumstances will grow towards the extremity you mention, unless\r\nprevented beforehand, I will endeavour to throw into your hands all the\r\nlights I can upon the subject.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, reclamation may mean two distinct things. All the\r\nreclamations that are made by the sections in behalf of persons detained\r\nas _suspect_ are made on the ground that the persons so detained are\r\npatriots, and the reclamation is good against the charge of \"suspect\"\r\nbecause it proves the contrary. But my situation includes another\r\ncircumstance. I am imprisoned on the charge (if it can be called one)\r\nof being a foreigner born in England. You know that foreigner to be a\r\ncitizen of the United States of America, and that he has been such since\r\nthe 4th of July 1776, the political birthday of the United States,\r\nand of every American citizen, for before that period all were British\r\nsubjects, and the States, then provinces, were British dominions.--Your\r\nreclamation of me therefore as a citizen of the United States (all other\r\nconsiderations apart) is good against the pretence for imprisoning me,\r\nor that pretence is equally good against every American citizen born\r\nin England, Ireland, Scotland, Germany, or Holland, and you know this\r\ndescription of men compose a very great part of the population of the\r\nthree States of New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania, and make also a\r\npart of Congress, and of the State Legislatures.\r\n\r\nEvery politician ought to know, and every civilian does know, that the\r\nLaw of Treaty of Alliance, and also that of Amity and Commerce knows no\r\ndistinction of American Citizens on account of the place of their birth,\r\nbut recognizes all to be Citizens whom the Constitution and laws of the\r\nUnited States of America recognize as such; and if I recollect rightly\r\nthere is an article in the Treaty of Commerce particular to this\r\npoint. The law therefore which they have here, to put all persons in\r\narrestation born in any of the Countries at war with France, is, when\r\napplied to Citizens of America born in England, Ireland, Scotland,\r\nGermany, or holland, a violation of the treaties of Alliance and of\r\nCommerce, because it assumes to make a distinction of Citizens which\r\nthose Treaties and the Constitution of America know nothing of. This is\r\na subject that officially comes under your cognizance as Minister, and\r\nit would be consistent that you expostulated with them upon the Case.\r\nThat foolish old man Vadier, who was president of the Convention and of\r\nthe Committee of Surety general when the Americans then in Paris went\r\nto the Bar of the Convention to reclaim me, gave them for answer that\r\nmy being born in England was cause sufficient for imprisoning me. It\r\nhappened that at least half those who went up with that address were in\r\nthe same case with myself.\r\n\r\nAs to reclamations on the ground of Patriotism it is difficult to know\r\nwhat is to be understood by Patriotism here. There is not a vice, and\r\nscarcely a virtue, that has not as the fashion of the moment suited\r\nbeen called by the name of Patriotism. The wretches who composed the\r\nrevolutionary tribunal of Nantz were the Patriots of that day and the\r\ncriminals of this. The Jacobins called themselves Patriots of the first\r\norder, men up to the height of the circumstances, and they are now\r\nconsidered as an antidote to Patriotism. But if we give to Patriotism a\r\nfixed idea consistent with that of a Republic, it would signify a strict\r\nadherence to the principles of Moral Justice, to the equality of civil\r\nand political Rights, to the System of representative Government, and an\r\nopposition to every hereditary claim to govern; and of this species\r\nof Patriotism you know my character. But, Sir, there are men on the\r\nCommittee who have changed their Party but not their principles. Their\r\naim is to hold power as long as possible by preventing the establishment\r\nof a Constitution, and these men are and will be my Enemies, and seek to\r\nhold me in prison as long as they can. I am too good a Patriot for them.\r\nIt is not improbable that they have heard of the strange language held\r\nby some Americans that I am not considered in America as an American\r\ncitizen, and they may also have heard say, that you had no orders\r\nrespecting me, and it is not improbable that they interpret that\r\nlanguage and that silence into a connivance at my imprisonment. If they\r\nhad not some ideas of this kind would they resist so long the civil\r\nefforts you make for my liberation, or would they attach so much\r\nimportance to the imprisonment of an Individual as _to risque_ (as\r\nyou say to me) _the good understanding that exists between the two\r\nCountries?_You also say that _it is impossible for any person to do more\r\nthan you have done without adopting the other means_, meaning that of\r\nreclaiming me. How then can you account for the want of success after so\r\nmany efforts, and such a length of time, upwards of ten weeks, without\r\nsupposing that they fortify themselves in the interpretation I have just\r\nmentioned? I can admit that it was not necessary to give orders, and\r\nthat it was difficult to give direct orders, for I much question if\r\nMorris had informed Congress or the President of the whole of the case,\r\nor had sent copies of my letters to him as I had desired him to do.\r\nYou would find the case here when you came, and you could not fully\r\nunderstand it till you did come, and as Minister you would have\r\nauthority to act upon it. But as you inform me that you know what the\r\nwishes of the President are, you will see also that his reputation is\r\nexposed to some risque, admitting there to be ground for the supposition\r\nI have made. It will not add to his popularity to have it believed in\r\nAmerica, as I am inclined to think the Committee believe here, that he\r\nconnives at my imprisonment. You say also that _it is known to everybody\r\nthat you wish my liberation_. It is, Sir, because they know your wishes\r\nthat they misinterpret the means you use. They suppose that those mild\r\nmeans arise from a restriction that you cannot use others, or from a\r\nconsciousness of some defect on my part of which you are unwilling to\r\nprovoke the enquiry.\r\n\r\nBut as you ask me if it be my wish that you should embark in this\r\ncontroversy and risque the consequences with respect to myself, I will\r\nanswer this part of the question by marking out precisely the part I\r\nwish you to take. What I mean is a sort of middle line above what you\r\nhave yet gone, and not up to the full extremity of the case, which will\r\nstill lie in reserve. It is to write a letter to the Committee that\r\nshall in the first place defeat by anticipation all the objections they\r\nmight make to a simple reclamation, and at the same time make the ground\r\ngood for that object. But, instead of sending the letter immediately, to\r\ninvite some of the Committee to your house and to make that invitation\r\nthe opportunity of shewing them the letter, expressing at the same time\r\na wish that you had done this, from a hope that the business might be\r\nsettled in an amicable manner without your being forced into an official\r\ninterference, that would excite the observations of the Enemies of both\r\nCountries, and probably interrupt the harmony that subsisted between the\r\ntwo republics. But as I can not convey the ideas I wish you to use by\r\nany means so concisely or so well as to suppose myself the writer of the\r\nletter I shall adopt this method and you will make use of such parts or\r\nsuch ideas of it as you please if you approve the plan. Here follows the\r\nsupposed letter:\r\n\r\nCitizens: When I first arrived amongst you as Minister from the United\r\nStates of America I was given to understand that the liberation of\r\nThomas Paine would take place without any official interference on my\r\npart. This was the more agreeable to me as it would not only supercede\r\nthe necessity of that interference, but would leave to yourselves the\r\nwhole opportunity of doing justice to a man who as far as I have been\r\nable to learn has suffered much cruel treatment under what you have\r\ndenominated the system of Terror. But as I find my expectations have not\r\nbeen fulfilled I am under the official necessity of being more explicit\r\nupon the subject than I have hitherto been.\r\n\r\nPermit me, in the first place, to observe that as it is impossible for\r\nme to suppose that it could have been the intention of France to seduce\r\nany citizens of America from their allegiance to their proper country\r\nby offering them the title of French citizen, so must I be compelled to\r\nbelieve, that the title of French citizen conferred on Thomas Paine was\r\nintended only as a mark of honorary respect towards a man who had\r\nso eminently distinguished himself in defence of liberty, and on no\r\noccasion more so than in promoting and defending your own revolution.\r\nFor a proof of this I refer you to his two works entitled _Rights of\r\nMan_. Those works have procured to him an addition of esteem in America,\r\nand I am sorry they have been so ill rewarded in France. But be this\r\ntitle of French Citizen more or less, it is now entirely swept away by\r\nthe vote of the Convention which declares him to be a foreigner, and\r\nwhich supercedes the vote of the Assembly that conferred that title upon\r\nhim, consequently upon the case superceded with it.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of this vote of the Convention declaring him to be a\r\nforeigner the former Committees have imprisoned him. It is therefore\r\nbecome my official duty to declare to you that the foreigner thus\r\nimprisoned is a citizen of the United States of America as fully, as\r\nlegally, as constitutionally as myself, and that he is moreover one of\r\nthe principal founders of the American Republic.\r\n\r\nI have been informed of a law or decree of the Convention which\r\nsubjects foreigners born in any of the countries at war with France\r\nto arrestation and imprisonment. This law when applied to citizens of\r\nAmerica born in England is an infraction of the Treaty of Alliance and\r\nof Amity and Commerce, which knows no distinction of American citizens\r\non account of the place of their birth, but recognizes all to be\r\ncitizens whom the Constitution and laws of America recognize as such.\r\nThe circumstances under which America has been peopled requires this\r\nguard on her Treaties, because the mass of her citizens are composed not\r\nof natives only but also of the natives of almost all the countries\r\nof Europe who have sought an asylum there from the persecutions they\r\nexperienced in their own countries. After this intimation you will\r\nwithout doubt see the propriety of modelling that law to the principles\r\nof the Treaty, because the law of Treaty in cases where it applies is\r\nthe governing law to both parties alike, and it cannot be infracted\r\nwithout hazarding the existence of the Treaty.\r\n\r\nOf the Patriotism of Thomas Paine I can speak fully, if we agree to give\r\nto patriotism a fixed idea consistent with that of a republic. It would\r\nthen signify a strict adherence to Moral Justice, to the equality of\r\ncivil and political rights, to the system of representative government,\r\nand an opposition to all hereditary claims to govern. Admitting\r\npatriotism to consist in these principles, I know of no man who has gone\r\nbeyond Thomas Paine in promulgating and defending them, and that for\r\nalmost twenty years past.\r\n\r\nI have now spoken to you on the principal matters concerned in the case\r\nof Thomas Paine. The title of French citizen which you had enforced upon\r\nhim, you have since taken away by declaring him to be a foreigner, and\r\nconsequently this part of the subject ceases of itself. I have declared\r\nto you that this foreigner is a citizen of the United States of America,\r\nand have assured you of his patriotism.\r\n\r\nI cannot help at the same time repeating to you my wish that his\r\nliberation had taken place without my being obliged to go thus far into\r\nthe subject, because it is the mutual interest of both republics to\r\navoid as much as possible all subjects of controversy, especially those\r\nfrom which no possible good can flow. I still hope that you will save me\r\nthe unpleasant task of proceeding any farther by sending me an order\r\nfor his liberation, which the injured state of his health absolutely\r\nrequires. I shall be happy to receive such an order from you and\r\nhappy in presenting it to him, for to the welfare of Thomas Paine the\r\nAmericans are not and cannot be indifferent.\r\n\r\nThis is the sort of letter I wish you to write, for I have no idea that\r\nyou will succeed by any measures that can, by any kind of construction,\r\nbe interpreted into a want of confidence or an apprehension of\r\nconsequences. It is themselves that ought to be apprehensive of\r\nconsequences if any are to be apprehended. They, I mean the Committees,\r\nare not certain that the Convention or the nation would support them\r\nin forcing any question to extremity that might interrupt the good\r\nunderstanding subsisting between the two countries; and I know of no\r\nquestion [so likely] to do this as that which involves the rights and\r\nliberty of a citizen.\r\n\r\nYou will please to observe that I have put the case of French\r\ncitizenship in a point of view that ought not only to preclude, but to\r\nmake them ashamed to advance any thing upon this subject; and this is\r\nbetter than to have to answer their counter-reclamation afterwards.\r\nEither the Citizenship was intended as a token of honorary respect, or\r\nit was in-tended to deprive America of a citizen or to seduce him from\r\nhis allegiance to his proper country. If it was intended as an honour\r\nthey must act consistently with the principle of honour. But if they\r\nmake a pretence for detaining me, they convict themselves of the act\r\nof seduction. Had America singled out any particular French citizen,\r\ncomplimented him with the title of Citizen of America, which he without\r\nsuspecting any fraudulent intention might accept, and then after having\r\ninvited or rather inveigled him into America made his acceptance of\r\nthat Title a pretence for seducing or forcing him from his allegiance to\r\nFrance, would not France have just cause to be offended at America? And\r\nought not America to have the same right to be offended at France? And\r\nwill the Committees take upon themselves to answer for the dishonour\r\nthey bring upon the National Character of their Country? If these\r\narguments are stated beforehand they will prevent the Committees going\r\ninto the subject of French Citizenship. They must be ashamed of it.\r\nBut after all the case comes to this, that this French Citizenship\r\nappertains no longer to me because the Convention, as I have already\r\nsaid, have swept it away by declaring me to be foreigner, and it is not\r\nin the power of the Committees to reverse it. But if I am to be citizen\r\nand foreigner, and citizen again, just when and how and for any purpose\r\nthey please, they take the Government of America into their own hands\r\nand make her only a Cypher in their system.\r\n\r\nThough these ideas have been long with me they have been more\r\nparticularly matured by reading your last Communication, and I have\r\nmany reasons to wish you had opened that Communication sooner. I am best\r\nacquainted with the persons you have to deal with and the circumstances\r\nof my own case. If you chuse to adopt the letter as it is, I send you a\r\ntranslation for the sake of expediting the business. I have endeavoured\r\nto conceive your own manner of expression as well as I could, and the\r\ncivility of language you would use, but the matter of the letter is\r\nessential to me.\r\n\r\nIf you chuse to confer with some of the members of the Committee at\r\nyour own house on the subject of the letter it may render the sending it\r\nunnecessary; but in either case I must request and press you not to give\r\naway to evasion and delay, and that you will fix positively with them\r\nthat they shall give you an answer in three or four days whether they\r\nwill liberate me on the representation you have made in the letter, or\r\nwhether you must be forced to go further into the subject. The state of\r\nmy health will not admit of delay, and besides the tortured state of\r\nmy mind wears me down. If they talk of bringing me to trial (and I well\r\nknow there is no accusation against me and that they can bring none)\r\nI certainly summons you as an Evidence to my Character. This you may\r\nmention to them either as what I intend to do or what you intend to do\r\nvoluntarily for me.\r\n\r\nI am anxious that you undertake this business without losing time,\r\nbecause if I am not liberated in the course of this decade, I intend, if\r\nin case the seventy-one detained deputies are liberated, to follow the\r\nsame track that they have done, and publish my own case myself.(1)\r\nI cannot rest any longer in this state of miserable suspense, be the\r\nconsequences what they may.\r\n\r\nThomas Paine.\r\n\r\n     1 Those deputies, imprisoned for having protested against\r\n     the overthrow of the Girondin government, May 31,1793, when\r\n     the Convention was invaded and overawed by the armed\r\n     communes of Paris. These deputies were liberated and\r\n     recalled to the Convention, December 8, 1794. Paine was\r\n     invited to resume his seat the day before, by a special act\r\n     of the Convention, after an eloquent speech by Thibaudeau.--\r\n     _Editor._.\r\n\r\n\r\nDear Sir: I need not mention to you the happiness I received from the\r\ninformation you sent me by Mr. Beresford. I easily guess the persons\r\nyou have conversed with on the subject of my liberation--but matters\r\nand even promises that pass in conversation are not quite so strictly\r\nattended to here as in the Country you come from. I am not, my Dear Sir,\r\nimpatient from any thing in my disposition, but the state of my health\r\nrequires liberty and a better air; and besides this, the rules of the\r\nprison do not permit me, though I have all the indulgences the Concierge\r\ncan give, to procure the things necessary to my recovery, which is\r\nslow as to strength. I have a tolerable appetite but the allowance of\r\nprovision is scanty. We are not allowed a knife to cut our victuals\r\nwith, nor a razor to shave; but they have lately allowed some barbers\r\nthat are here to shave. The room where I am lodged is a ground floor\r\nlevel with the earth in the garden and floored with brick, and is so\r\nwet after every rain that I cannot guard against taking colds that\r\ncontinually cheat my recovery. If you could, without interfering with or\r\nderanging the mode proposed for my liberation, inform the Committee that\r\nthe state of my health requires liberty and air, it would be good ground\r\nto hasten my liberation. The length of my imprisonment is also a reason,\r\nfor I am now almost the oldest inhabitant of this uncomfortable mansion,\r\nand I see twenty, thirty and sometimes forty persons a day put in\r\nliberty who have not been so long confined as myself. Their liberation\r\nis a happiness to me; but I feel sometimes, a little mortification\r\nthat I am thus left behind. I leave it entirely to you to arrange this\r\nmatter. The messenger waits. Your's affectionately,\r\n\r\nT. P.\r\n\r\nI hope and wish much to see you. I have much to say. I have had the\r\nattendance of Dr. Graham (Physician to Genl. O'Hara, who is prisoner\r\nhere) and of Dr. Makouski, house physician, who has been most\r\nexceedingly kind to me. After I am at liberty I shall be glad to\r\nintroduce him to you.\r\n\r\n     1 This letter, written in a feeble handwriting, is not\r\n     dated, but Monroe's endorsement, \"2d. Luxembourg,\"\r\n     indicates November 2, two days before Paine's liberation.--\r\n     _Editor._.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXII. LETTER TO GEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\nParis, July 30, 1796.\r\n\r\nAs censure is but awkwardly softened by apology. I shall offer you\r\nno apology for this letter. The eventful crisis to which your double\r\npolitics have conducted the affairs of your country, requires an\r\ninvestigation uncramped by ceremony.\r\n\r\nThere was a time when the fame of America, moral and political, stood\r\nfair and high in the world. The lustre of her revolution extended itself\r\nto every individual; and to be a citizen of America gave a title to\r\nrespect in Europe. Neither meanness nor ingratitude had been mingled\r\nin the composition of her character. Her resistance to the attempted\r\ntyranny of England left her unsuspected of the one, and her open\r\nacknowledgment of the aid she received from France precluded all\r\nsuspicion of the other. The Washington of politics had not then\r\nappeared.\r\n\r\nAt the time I left America (April 1787) the Continental Convention, that\r\nformed the federal Constitution was on the point of meeting. Since that\r\ntime new schemes of politics, and new distinctions of parties, have\r\narisen. The term _Antifederalist_ has been applied to all those who\r\ncombated the defects of that constitution, or opposed the measures\r\nof your administration. It was only to the absolute necessity of\r\nestablishing some federal authority, extending equally over all the\r\nStates, that an instrument so inconsistent as the present federal\r\nConstitution is, obtained a suffrage. I would have voted for it myself,\r\nhad I been in America, or even for a worse, rather than have had none,\r\nprovided it contained the means of remedying its defects by the same\r\nappeal to the people by which it was to be established. It is always\r\nbetter policy to leave removeable errors to expose themselves, than\r\nto hazard too much in contending against them theoretically. I have\r\nintroduced these observations, not only to mark the general difference\r\nbetween Antifederalist and Anti-constitutionalist, but to preclude\r\nthe effect, and even the application, of the former of these terms to\r\nmyself. I declare myself opposed to several matters in the Constitution,\r\nparticularly to the manner in which what is called the Executive is\r\nformed, and to the long duration of the Senate; and if I live to return\r\nto America, I will use all my endeavours to have them altered.(*) I also\r\ndeclare myself opposed to almost the whole of your administration; for\r\nI know it to have been deceitful, if not perfidious, as I shall shew\r\nin the course of this letter. But as to the point of consolidating the\r\nStates into a Federal Government, it so happens, that the proposition\r\nfor that purpose came originally from myself. I proposed it in a letter\r\nto Chancellor Livingston in the spring of 1782, while that gentleman\r\nwas Minister for Foreign Affairs. The five per cent, duty recommended\r\nby Congress had then fallen through, having been adopted by some of the\r\nStates, altered by others, rejected by Rhode Island, and repealed by\r\nVirginia after it had been consented to. The proposal in the letter I\r\nallude to, was to get over the whole difficulty at once, by annexing a\r\ncontinental legislative body to Congress; for in order to have any law\r\nof the Union uniform, the case could only be, that either Congress, as\r\nit then stood, must frame the law, and the States severally adopt it\r\nwithout alteration, or the States must erect a Continental Legislature\r\nfor the purpose. Chancellor Livingston, Robert Morris, Gouverneur\r\nMorris, and myself, had a meeting at the house of Robert Morris on\r\nthe subject of that letter. There was no diversity of opinion on the\r\nproposition for a Continental Legislature: the only difficulty was on\r\nthe manner of bringing the proposition forward. For my own part, as I\r\nconsidered it as a remedy in reserve, that could be applied at any time\r\n_when the States saw themselves wrong enough to be put right_, (which\r\ndid not appear to be the case at that time) I did not see the propriety\r\nof urging it precipitately, and declined being the publisher of it\r\nmyself. After this account of a fact, the leaders of your party will\r\nscarcely have the hardiness to apply to me the term of Antifederalist.\r\nBut I can go to a date and to a fact beyond this; for the proposition\r\nfor electing a continental convention to form the Continental Government\r\nis one of the subjects treated of in the pamphlet _Common Sense_.(1)\r\n\r\n     * I have always been opposed to the mode of refining\r\n     Government up to an individual, or what is called a single\r\n     Executive. Such a man will always be the chief of a party. A\r\n     plurality is far better: It combines the mass of a nation\r\n     better together: And besides this, it is necessary to the\r\n     manly mind of a republic that it loses the debasing idea of\r\n     obeying an individual.--_Author_.\r\n\r\n\r\n     1 See vol. i. of this work, pp. 97, 98, 109, no.--_Editor._.\r\n\r\nHaving thus cleared away a little of the rubbish that might otherwise\r\nhave lain in my way, I return to the point of time at which the present\r\nFederal Constitution and your administration began. It was very well\r\nsaid by an anonymous writer in Philadelphia, about a year before that\r\nperiod, that \"_thirteen staves and ne'er a hoop will not make a barrel_\"\r\nand as any kind of hooping the barrel, however defectively executed,\r\nwould be better than none, it was scarcely possible but that\r\nconsiderable advantages must arise from the federal hooping of the\r\nStates. It was with pleasure that every sincere friend of America\r\nbeheld, as the natural effect of union, her rising prosperity; and it\r\nwas with grief they saw that prosperity mixed, even in the blossom,\r\nwith the germ of corruption. Monopolies of every kind marked your\r\nadministration almost in the moment of its commencement. The lands\r\nobtained by the revolution were lavished upon partisans; the interest\r\nof the disbanded soldier was sold to the speculator; injustice was acted\r\nunder the pretence of faith; and the chief of the army became the patron\r\nof the fraud.(2) From such a beginning what else could be expected, than\r\nwhat has happened? A mean and servile submission to the insults of one\r\nnation; treachery and ingratitude to another.\r\n\r\n     2 The history of the Scioto Company, by which so many\r\n     Frenchmen as well as Americans were ruined, warranted an\r\n     even stronger statement. Though Washington did not know what\r\n     was going on, he cannot be acquitted of a lack of due\r\n     precaution in patronizing leading agents of these\r\n     speculations, and introducing them in France.--_Editor._\r\n\r\nSome vices make their approach with such a splendid appearance, that we\r\nscarcely know to what class of moral distinctions they belong. They\r\nare rather virtues corrupted than vices, originally. But meanness and\r\ningratitude have nothing equivocal in their character. There is not a\r\ntrait in them that renders them doubtful. They are so originally vice,\r\nthat they are generated in the dung of other vices, and crawl into\r\nexistence with the filth upon their back. The fugitives have found\r\nprotection in you, and the levee-room is their place of rendezvous.\r\n\r\nAs the Federal Constitution is a copy, though not quite so base as the\r\noriginal, of the form of the British Government, an imitation of its\r\nvices was naturally to be expected. So intimate is the connection\r\nbetween _form and practice_, that to adopt the one is to invite the\r\nother. Imitation is naturally progressive, and is rapidly so in matters\r\nthat are vicious.\r\n\r\nSoon after the Federal Constitution arrived in England, I received a\r\nletter from a female literary correspondent (a native of New York) very\r\nwell mixed with friendship, sentiment, and politics. In my answer\r\nto that letter, I permitted myself to ramble into the wilderness of\r\nimagination, and to anticipate what might hereafter be the condition\r\nof America. I had no idea that the picture I then drew was realizing\r\nso fast, and still less that Mr. Washington was hurrying it on. As the\r\nextract I allude to is congenial with the subject I am upon, I here\r\ntranscribe it:\r\n\r\n     [_The extract is the same as that given in a footnote, in\r\n     the Memorial to Monroe, p. 180_.]\r\n\r\nImpressed, as I was, with apprehensions of this kind, I had America\r\nconstantly in my mind in all the publications I afterwards made. The\r\nFirst, and still more the Second, Part of the Rights of Man, bear\r\nevident marks of this watchfulness; and the Dissertation on First\r\nPrinciples of Government [XXIV.] goes more directly to the point than\r\neither of the former. I now pass on to other subjects.\r\n\r\nIt will be supposed by those into whose hands this letter may fall, that\r\nI have some personal resentment against you; I will therefore settle\r\nthis point before I proceed further.\r\n\r\nIf I have any resentment, you must acknowledge that I have not been\r\nhasty in declaring it; neither would it now be declared (for what are\r\nprivate resentments to the public) if the cause of it did not unite\r\nitself as well with your public as with your private character, and with\r\nthe motives of your political conduct.\r\n\r\nThe part I acted in the American revolution is well known; I shall not\r\nhere repeat it. I know also that had it not been for the aid received\r\nfrom France, in men, money and ships, that your cold and unmilitary\r\nconduct (as I shall shew in the course of this letter) would in all\r\nprobability have lost America; at least she would not have been the\r\nindependent nation she now is. You slept away your time in the field,\r\ntill the finances of the country were completely exhausted, and you have\r\nbut little share in the glory of the final event. It is time, sir, to\r\nspeak the undisguised language of historical truth.\r\n\r\nElevated to the chair of the Presidency, you assumed the merit of every\r\nthing to yourself, and the natural ingratitude of your constitution\r\nbegan to appear. You commenced your Presidential career by encouraging\r\nand swallowing the grossest adulation, and you travelled America from\r\none end to the other to put yourself in the way of receiving it. You\r\nhave as many addresses in your chest as James the II. As to what were\r\nyour views, for if you are not great enough to have ambition you are\r\nlittle enough to have vanity, they cannot be directly inferred from\r\nexpressions of your own; but the partizans of your politics have\r\ndivulged the secret.\r\n\r\nJohn Adams has said, (and John it is known was always a speller after\r\nplaces and offices, and never thought his little services were highly\r\nenough paid,)--John has said, that as Mr. Washington had no child, the\r\nPresidency should be made hereditary in the family of Lund Washington.\r\nJohn might then have counted upon some sinecure himself, and a provision\r\nfor his descendants. He did not go so far as to say, also, that the\r\nVice-Presidency should be hereditary in the family of John Adams. He\r\nprudently left that to stand on the ground that one good turn deserves\r\nanother.(*)\r\n\r\nJohn Adams is one of those men who never contemplated the origin of\r\ngovernment, or comprehended any thing of first principles. If he had,\r\nhe might have seen, that the right to set up and establish hereditary\r\ngovernment, never did, and never can, exist in any generation at any\r\ntime whatever; that it is of the nature of treason; because it is an\r\nattempt to take away the rights of all the minors living at that time,\r\nand of all succeeding generations. It is of a degree beyond common\r\ntreason. It is a sin against nature. The equal right of every generation\r\nis a right fixed in the nature of things. It belongs to the son when of\r\nage, as it belonged to the father before him. John Adams would himself\r\ndeny the right that any former deceased generation could have to\r\ndecree authoritatively a succession of governors over him, or over his\r\nchildren; and yet he assumes the pretended right, treasonable as it is,\r\nof acting it himself. His ignorance is his best excuse.\r\n\r\nJohn Jay has said,(**) (and this John was always the sycophant of\r\nevery thing in power, from Mr. Girard in America, to Grenville in\r\nEngland,)--John Jay has said, that the Senate should have been appointed\r\nfor life. He would then have been sure of never wanting a lucrative\r\nappointment for himself, and have had no fears about impeachment. These\r\nare the disguised traitors that call themselves Federalists.(**)\r\n\r\nCould I have known to what degree of corruption and perfidy the\r\nadministrative part of the government of America had descended, I\r\ncould have been at no loss to have understood the reservedness of Mr.\r\nWashington towards me, during my imprisonment in the Luxembourg. There\r\nare cases in which silence is a loud language. I will here explain the\r\ncause of that imprisonment, and return to Mr. Washington afterwards.\r\n\r\n     * Two persons to whom John Adams said this, told me of it.\r\n     The secretary of Mr. Jay was present when it was told to\r\n     me.--_Author_.\r\n\r\n     **  If Mr. John Jay desires to know on what authority I say\r\n     this, I will give that authority publicly when he chooses to\r\n     call for it--_Author_.\r\n\r\nIn the course of that rage, terror and suspicion, which the brutal\r\nletter of the Duke of Brunswick first started into existence in France,\r\nit happened that almost every man who was opposed to violence, or who\r\nwas not violent himself, became suspected. I had constantly been opposed\r\nto every thing which was of the nature or of the appearance of violence;\r\nbut as I had always done it in a manner that shewed it to be a principle\r\nfounded in my heart, and not a political manouvre, it precluded the\r\npretence of accusing me. I was reached, however, under another pretence.\r\n\r\nA decree was passed to imprison all persons born in England; but as\r\nI was a member of the Convention, and had been complimented with the\r\nhonorary style of Citizen of France, as Mr. Washington and some other\r\nAmericans had been, this decree fell short of reaching me. A motion was\r\nafterwards made and carried, supported chiefly by Bourdon de l'Oise,\r\nfor expelling foreigners from the Convention. My expulsion being thus\r\neffected, the two committees of Public Safety and of General Surety,\r\nof which Robespierre was the dictator, put me in arrestation under the\r\nformer decree for imprisoning persons born in England. Having thus shewn\r\nunder what pretence the imprisonment was effected, I come to speak of\r\nsuch parts of the case as apply between me and Mr. Washington, either as\r\na President or as an individual.\r\n\r\nI have always considered that a foreigner, such as I was in fact, with\r\nrespect to France, might be a member of a Convention for framing a\r\nConstitution, without affecting his right of citizenship in the\r\ncountry to which he belongs, but not a member of a government after\r\na Constitution is formed; and I have uniformly acted upon this\r\ndistinction» To be a member of a government requires that a person be\r\nin allegiance to that government and to the country locally. But a\r\nConstitution, being a thing of principle, and not of action, and\r\nwhich, after it is formed, is to be referred to the people for their\r\napprobation or rejection, does not require allegiance in the persons\r\nforming and proposing it; and besides this, it is only to the thing\r\nafter it be formed and established, and to the country after its\r\ngovernmental character is fixed by the adoption of a constitution, that\r\nthe allegiance can be given. No oath of allegiance or of citizenship was\r\nrequired of the members who composed the Convention: there was nothing\r\nexisting in form to swear allegiance to. If any such condition had been\r\nrequired, I could not, as Citizen of America in fact, though Citizen of\r\nFrance by compliment, have accepted a seat in the Convention.\r\n\r\nAs my citizenship in America was not altered or diminished by any thing\r\nI had done in Europe, (on the contrary, it ought to be considered as\r\nstrengthened, for it was the American principle of government that I\r\nwas endeavouring to spread in Europe,) and as it is the duty of every\r\ngovern-ment to charge itself with the care of any of its citizens who\r\nmay happen to fall under an arbitrary persecution abroad, and is also\r\none of the reasons for which ambassadors or ministers are appointed,--it\r\nwas the duty of the Executive department in America, to have made (at\r\nleast) some enquiries about me, as soon as it heard of my imprisonment.\r\nBut if this had not been the case, that government owed it to me on\r\nevery ground and principle of honour and gratitude. Mr. Washington owed\r\nit to me on every score of private acquaintance, I will not now say,\r\nfriendship; for it has some time been known by those who know him, that\r\nhe has no friendships; that he is incapable of forming any; he can serve\r\nor desert a man, or a cause, with constitutional indifference; and it is\r\nthis cold hermaphrodite faculty that imposed itself upon the world,\r\nand was credited for a while by enemies as by friends, for prudence,\r\nmoderation and impartiality.(1)\r\n\r\n     1 \"L'on pent dire qu'il [Washington] jouit de tous les\r\n     avantages possibles a l'exception des douceurs de\r\n     l'amitié.\"--Louis Otto, Chargé d'Affaires (at New York) to\r\n     his government, 13 June, 1790. French Archives, vol. 35, No.\r\n     32.--Editor.\r\n\r\nSoon after I was put into arrestation, and imprisoned in the Luxembourg,\r\nthe Americans who were then in Paris went in a body to the bar of the\r\nConvention to reclaim me. They were answered by the then President\r\nVadier, who has since absconded, that _I was born in England_, and it\r\nwas signified to them, by some of the Committee of _General Surety_, to\r\nwhom they were referred (I have been told it was Billaud Varennes,) that\r\ntheir reclamation of me was only the act of individuals, without any\r\nauthority from the American government.\r\n\r\nA few days after this, all communications from persons imprisoned to\r\nany person without the prison was cut off by an order of the Police. I\r\nneither saw, nor heard from, any body for six months; and the only hope\r\nthat remained to me was, that a new Minister would arrive from America\r\nto supercede Morris, and that he would be authorized to enquire into\r\nthe cause of my imprisonment. But even this hope, in the state to which\r\nmatters were daily arriving, was too remote to have any consolatory\r\neffect, and I contented myself with the thought, that I might be\r\nremembered when it would be too late. There is perhaps no condition from\r\nwhich a man conscious of his own uprightness cannot derive consolation;\r\nfor it is in itself a consolation for him to find, that he can bear that\r\ncondition with calmness and fortitude.\r\n\r\nFrom about the middle of March (1794) to the fall of Robespierre\r\nJuly 29, (9th of Thermidor,) the state of things in the prisons was a\r\ncontinued scene of horror. No man could count upon life for twenty-four\r\nhours. To such a pitch of rage and suspicion were Robespierre and his\r\nCommittee arrived, that it seemed as if they feared to leave a man\r\nliving. Scarcely a night passed in which ten, twenty, thirty, forty,\r\nfifty, or more, were not taken out of the prison, carried before a\r\npretended tribunal in the morning, and guillotined before night. One\r\nhundred and sixty-nine were taken out of the Luxembourg one night, in\r\nthe month of July, and one hundred and sixty of them guillotined. A\r\nlist of two hundred more, according to the report in the prison, was\r\npreparing a few days before Robespierre fell. In this last list I have\r\ngood reason to believe I was included. A memorandum in the hand-writing\r\nof Robespierre was afterwards produced in the Convention, by the\r\ncommittee to whom the papers of Robespierre were referred, in these\r\nwords:\r\n\r\n     \"Demander que Thomas           \"I Demand that Thomas Paine\r\n     \"Payne soit décrété d'ac-       be decreed of accusation\r\n     \"cusation pour les inté-        for the interests of America\r\n     \"rôtsde l'Amérique,autant       as well as of France.\"\r\n     \"que de la France.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n     1 In reading this the Committee added, \"Why Thomas Payne\r\n     more than another? Because He helped to establish the\r\n     liberty of both worlds.\"--_Editor_.\r\n\r\nI had then been imprisoned seven months, and the silence of the\r\nExecutive part of the government of America (Mr. Washington) upon the\r\ncase, and upon every thing respecting me, was explanation enough to\r\nRobespierre that he might proceed to extremities.\r\n\r\nA violent fever which had nearly terminated my existence, was, I\r\nbelieve, the circumstance that preserved it. I was not in a condition to\r\nbe removed, or to know of what was passing, or of what had passed, for\r\nmore than a month. It makes a blank in my remembrance of life. The first\r\nthing I was informed of was the fall of Robespierre.\r\n\r\nAbout a week after this, Mr. Monroe arrived to supercede Gouverneur\r\nMorris, and as soon as I was able to write a note legible enough to be\r\nread, I found a way to convey one to him by means of the man who lighted\r\nthe lamps in the prison; and whose unabated friendship to me, from whom\r\nhe had never received any service, and with difficulty accepted any\r\nrecompense, puts the character of Mr. Washington to shame.\r\n\r\nIn a few days I received a message from Mr. Monroe, conveyed to me in a\r\nnote from an intermediate person, with assurance of his friendship, and\r\nexpressing a desire that I would rest the case in his hands. After a\r\nfortnight or more had passed, and hearing nothing farther, I wrote to a\r\nfriend who was then in Paris, a citizen of Philadelphia, requesting him\r\nto inform me what was the true situation of things with respect to me. I\r\nwas sure that something was the matter; I began to have hard thoughts of\r\nMr. Washington, but I was unwilling to encourage them.\r\n\r\nIn about ten days, I received an answer to my letter, in which the\r\nwriter says, \"Mr. Monroe has told me that he has no order [meaning from\r\nthe President, Mr. Washington] respecting you, but that he (Mr. Monroe)\r\nwill do every thing in his power to liberate you; but, from what I learn\r\nfrom the Americans lately arrived in Paris, you are not considered,\r\neither by the American government, or by the individuals, as an American\r\ncitizen.\"\r\n\r\nI was now at no loss to understand Mr. Washington and his new fangled\r\nfaction, and that their policy was silently to leave me to fall in\r\nFrance. They were rushing as fast as they could venture, without\r\nawakening the jealousy of America, into all the vices and corruptions of\r\nthe British government; and it was no more consistent with the policy\r\nof Mr. Washington, and those who immediately surrounded him, than it was\r\nwith that of Robespierre or of Pitt, that I should survive. They have,\r\nhowever, missed the mark, and the reaction is upon themselves.\r\n\r\nUpon the receipt of the letter just alluded to, I sent a memorial to Mr.\r\nMonroe, which the reader will find in the appendix, and I received from\r\nhim the following answer.(1) It is dated the 18th of September, but did\r\nnot come to hand till about the 4th of October. I was then failing into\r\na relapse, the weather was becoming damp and cold, fuel was not to be\r\nhad, and the abscess in my side, the consequence of these things, and\r\nof the want of air and exercise, was beginning to form, and which has\r\ncontinued immoveable ever since. Here follows Mr. Monroe's letter.\r\n\r\n     1 The appendix consisted of an abridgment of the Memorial,\r\n     which forms the preceding chapter (XXI.) in this volume.--\r\n     _Editor._.\r\n\r\n\r\nParis, September 18th, 1794. \"Dear Sir,\r\n\r\n\"I was favoured soon after my arrival here with several letters from\r\nyou, and more latterly with one in the character of memorial upon the\r\nsubject of your confinement; and should have answered them at the\r\ntimes they were respectively written had I not concluded you would have\r\ncalculated with certainty upon the deep interest I take in your welfare,\r\nand the pleasure with which I shall embrace every opportunity in my\r\npower to serve you. I should still pursue the same course, and for\r\nreasons which must obviously occur, if I did not find that you are\r\ndisquieted with apprehensions upon interesting points, and which justice\r\nto you and our country equally forbid you should entertain. You mention\r\nthat you have been informed you are not considered as an American\r\ncitizen by the Americans, and that you have likewise heard that I had\r\nno instructions respecting you by the government. I doubt not the person\r\nwho gave you the information meant well, but I suspect he did not even\r\nconvey accurately his own ideas on the first point: for I presume the\r\nmost he could say is, that you had likewise become a French citizen,\r\nand which by no means deprived you of being an American one. Even\r\nthis, however, may be doubted, I mean the acquisition of citizenship in\r\nFrance, and I confess you have said much to show that it has not been\r\nmade. I really suspect that this was all that the gentleman who wrote\r\nto you, and those Americans he heard speak upon the subject meant. It\r\nbecomes my duty, however, to declare to you, that I consider you as\r\nan American citizen, and that you are considered universally in that\r\ncharacter by the people of America. As such you are entitled to my\r\nattention; and so far as it can be given consistently with those\r\nobligations which are mutual between every government and even a\r\ntransient passenger, you shall receive it.\r\n\r\n\"The Congress have never decided upon the subject of citizenship in\r\na manner to regard the present case. By being with us through the\r\nrevolution you are of our country as absolutely as if you had been born\r\nthere, and you are no more of England, than every native American is.\r\nThis is the true doctrine in the present case, so far as it becomes\r\ncomplicated with any other consideration. I have mentioned it to make\r\nyou easy upon the only point which could give you any disquietude.\r\n\r\n\"Is it necessary for me to tell you how much all your countrymen, I\r\nspeak of the great mass of the people, are interested in your welfare?\r\nThey have not forgotten the history of their own revolution and the\r\ndifficult scenes through which they passed; nor do they review its\r\nseveral stages without reviving in their bosoms a due sensibility of the\r\nmerits of those who served them in that great and arduous conflict. The\r\ncrime of ingratitude has not yet stained, and I trust never will stain,\r\nour national character. You are considered by them as not only having\r\nrendered important service in our own revolution, but as being, on a\r\nmore extensive scale, the friend of human rights, and a distinguished\r\nand able advocate in favour of public liberty. To the welfare of Thomas\r\nPaine, the Americans are not, nor can they be, indifferent.\r\n\r\n\"Of the sense which the President has always entertained of your merits,\r\nand of his friendly disposition towards you, you are too well assured\r\nto require any declaration of it from me. That I forward his wishes\r\nin seeking your safety is what I well know, and this will form an\r\nadditional obligation on me to perform what I should otherwise consider\r\nas a duty.\r\n\r\n\"You are, in my opinion, at present menaced by no kind of danger.\r\nTo liberate you, will be an object of my endeavours, and as soon as\r\npossible. But you must, until that event shall be accomplished, bear\r\nyour situation with patience and fortitude. You will likewise have the\r\njustice to recollect, that I am placed here upon a difficult theatre*\r\nmany important objects to attend to, with few to consult It becomes me\r\nin pursuit of those to regulate my conduct in respect to each, as to\r\nthe manner and the time, as will, in my judgment, be best calculated to\r\naccomplish the whole.\r\n\r\n\"With great esteem and respect consider me personally your friend,\r\n\r\n\"James Monroe.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe part in Mr. Monroe's letter, in which he speaks of the President,\r\n(Mr. Washington,) is put in soft language. Mr. Monroe knew what Mr.\r\nWashington had said formerly, and he was willing to keep that in view.\r\nBut the fact is, not only that Mr. Washington had given no orders to Mr.\r\nMonroe, as the letter [of Whiteside] stated, but he did not so much as\r\nsay to him, enquire if Mr. Paine be dead or alive, in prison or out, or\r\nsee if there be any assistance we can give him.\r\n\r\n     This I presume alludes to the embarrassments which the\r\n     strange conduct of Gouverneur Morris had occasioned, and\r\n     which, I well know, had created suspicions of the sincerity\r\n     of Mr. Washington.--_Author_. voi. m--ij\r\n\r\nWhile these matters were passing, the liberations from the prisons were\r\nnumerous; from twenty to forty in the course of almost every twenty-four\r\nhours. The continuance of my imprisonment after a new Minister had\r\narrived immediately from America, which was now more than two months,\r\nwas a matter so obviously strange, that I found the character of the\r\nAmerican government spoken of in very unqualified terms of reproach;\r\nnot only by those who still remained in prison, but by those who were\r\nliberated, and by persons who had access to the prison from without.\r\nUnder these circumstances I wrote again to Mr. Monroe, and found\r\noccasion, among other things, to say: \"It will not add to the popularity\r\nof Mr. Washington to have it believed in America, as it is believed\r\nhere, that he connives at my imprisonment.\"\r\n\r\nThe case, so far as it respected Mr. Monroe, was, that having to get\r\nover the difficulties, which the strange conduct of Gouverneur Morris\r\nhad thrown in the way of a successor, and having no authority from the\r\nAmerican government to speak officially upon any thing relating to me,\r\nhe found himself obliged to proceed by unofficial means with individual\r\nmembers; for though Robespierre was overthrown, the Robespierrian\r\nmembers of the Committee of Public Safety still remained in considerable\r\nforce, and had they found out that Mr. Monroe had no official authority\r\nupon the case, they would have paid little or no regard to his\r\nreclamation of me. In the mean time my health was suffering exceedingly,\r\nthe dreary prospect of winter was coming on, and imprisonment was still\r\na thing of danger. After the Robespierrian members of the Committee were\r\nremoved by the expiration of their time of serving, Mr. Monroe reclaimed\r\nme, and I was liberated the 4th of November. Mr. Monroe arrived in Paris\r\nthe beginning of August before. All that period of my imprisonment,\r\nat least, I owe not to Robespierre, but to his colleague in projects,\r\nGeorge Washington. Immediately upon my liberation, Mr. Monroe invited me\r\nto his house, where I remained more than a year and a half; and I speak\r\nof his aid and friendship, as an open-hearted man will always do in such\r\na case, with respect and gratitude.\r\n\r\nSoon after my liberation, the Convention passed an unanimous vote,\r\nto invite me to return to my seat among them. The times were still\r\nunsettled and dangerous, as well from without as within, for the\r\ncoalition was unbroken, and the constitution not settled. I chose,\r\nhowever, to accept the invitation: for as I undertake nothing but what\r\nI believe to be right, I abandon nothing that I undertake; and I\r\nwas willing also to shew, that, as I was not of a cast of mind to be\r\ndeterred by prospects or retrospects of danger, so neither were my\r\nprinciples to be weakened by misfortune or perverted by disgust.\r\n\r\nBeing now once more abroad in the world, I began to find that I was\r\nnot the only one who had conceived an unfavourable opinion of Mr.\r\nWashington; it was evident that his character was on the decline as well\r\namong Americans as among foreigners of different nations. From being the\r\nchief of the government, he had made himself the chief of a party;\r\nand his integrity was questioned, for his politics had a doubtful\r\nappearance. The mission of Mr. Jay to London, notwithstanding there\r\nwas an American Minister there already, had then taken place, and was\r\nbeginning to be talked of. It appeared to others, as it did to me, to\r\nbe enveloped in mystery, which every day served either to increase or to\r\nexplain into matter of suspicion.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1790, or about that time, Mr. Washington, as President,\r\nhad sent Gouverneur Morris to London, as his secret agent to have some\r\ncommunication with the British Ministry. To cover the agency of Morris\r\nit was given out, I know not by whom, that he went as an agent from\r\nRobert Morris to borrow money in Europe, and the report was permitted\r\nto pass uncontradicted. The event of Morris's negociation was, that Mr.\r\nHammond was sent Minister from England to America, Pinckney from\r\nAmerica to England, and himself Minister to France. If, while Morris was\r\nMinister in France, he was not a emissary of the British Ministry and\r\nthe coalesced powers, he gave strong reasons to suspect him of it. No\r\none who saw his conduct, and heard his conversation, could doubt his\r\nbeing in their interest; and had he not got off the time he did, after\r\nhis recall, he would have been in arrestation. Some letters of his had\r\nfallen into the hands of the Committee of Public Safety, and enquiry was\r\nmaking after him.\r\n\r\nA great bustle had been made by Mr. Washington about the conduct of\r\nGenet in America, while that of his own Minister, Morris, in France, was\r\ninfinitely more reproachable. If Genet was imprudent or rash, he was not\r\ntreacherous; but Morris was all three. He was the enemy of the French\r\nrevolution, in every stage of it. But notwithstanding this conduct\r\non the part of Morris, and the known profligacy of his character, Mr.\r\nWashington in a letter he wrote to him at the time of recalling him on\r\nthe complaint and request of the Committee of Public Safety, assures\r\nhim, that though he had complied with that request, he still retained\r\nthe same esteem and friendship for him as before. This letter Morris was\r\nfoolish enough to tell of; and, as his own char-acter and conduct were\r\nnotorious, the telling of it could have but one effect, which was that\r\nof implicating the character of the writer.(1) Morris still loiters\r\nin Europe, chiefly in England; and Mr. Washington is still in\r\ncorrespondence with him. Mr. Washington ought, therefore, to expect,\r\nespecially since his conduct in the affairs of Jay's treaty, that France\r\nmust consider Morris and Washington as men of the same description. The\r\nchief difference, however, between the two is, (for in politics there\r\nis none,) that the one is profligate enough to profess an indifference\r\nabout _moral_ principles, and the other is prudent enough to conceal the\r\nwant of them.\r\n\r\n     1 Washington wrote to Morris, June 19,1794, \"my confidence\r\n     in and friendship for you remain undiminished.\" It was not\r\n     \"foolish\" but sagacious to show this one sentence, without\r\n     which Morris might not have escaped out of France. The\r\n     letter reveals Washington's mental decline. He says \"until\r\n     then [Fauchet's demand for recall of Morris, early 1794] I\r\n     had supposed you stood well with the powers that were.\"\r\n     Lafayette had pleaded for Morris's removal, and two French\r\n     Ministers before Fauchet, Ternant and Genet, had expressed\r\n     their Government's dissatisfaction with him. See Ford's\r\n     Writings of Washington, vii., p. 453; also Editor's\r\n     Introduction to XXI.--_Editor._\r\n\r\nAbout three months after I was at liberty, the official note of Jay\r\nto Grenville on the subject of the capture of American vessels by the\r\nBritish cruisers, appeared in the American papers that arrived at Paris.\r\nEvery thing was of a-piece. Every thing was mean. The same kind of\r\ncharacter went to all circumstances public or private. Disgusted at\r\nthis national degradation, as well as at the particular conduct of Mr.\r\nWashington to me, I wrote to him (Mr. Washington) on the 22d of February\r\n(1795) under cover to the then Secretary of State, (Mr. Randolph,) and\r\nentrusted the letter to Mr. Le-tombe, who was appointed French consul\r\nto Philadelphia, and was on the point of taking his departure. When I\r\nsupposed Mr. Letombe had sailed, I mentioned the letter to Mr. Monroe,\r\nand as I was then in his house, I shewed it to him. He expressed a\r\nwish that I would recall it, which he supposed might be done, as he had\r\nlearnt that Mr. Letombe had not then sailed. I agreed to do so, and it\r\nwas returned by Mr. Letombe under cover to Mr. Monroe.\r\n\r\nThe letter, however, will now reach Mr. Washington publicly in the\r\ncourse of this work.\r\n\r\nAbout the month of September following, I had a severe relapse which\r\ngave occasion to the report of my death. I had felt it coming on a\r\nconsiderable time before, which occasioned me to hasten the work I\r\nhad then in hand, the _Second part of the Age of Reason_. When I had\r\nfinished that work, I bestowed another letter on Mr. Washington, which I\r\nsent under cover to Mr. Benj. Franklin Bache of Philadelphia. The letter\r\nis as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Paris, September 20th, 1795.\r\n\r\n\"Sir,\r\n\r\n\"I had written you a letter by Mr. Letombe, French consul, but, at the\r\nrequest of Mr. Monroe, I withdrew it, and the letter is still by me.\r\nI was the more easily prevailed upon to do this, as it was then my\r\nintention to have returned to America the latter end of the present\r\nyear, 1795; but the illness I now suffer prevents me. In case I had\r\ncome, I should have applied to you for such parts of your official\r\nletters (and of your private ones, if you had chosen to give them) as\r\ncontained any instructions or directions either to Mr. Monroe, or to\r\nMr. Morris, or to any other person respecting me; for after you were\r\ninformed of my imprisonment in France, it was incumbent on you to have\r\nmade some enquiry into the cause, as you might very well conclude that I\r\nhad not the opportunity of informing you of it. I cannot understand your\r\nsilence upon this subject upon any other ground, than as _connivance_ at\r\nmy imprisonment; and this is the manner it is understood here, and will\r\nbe understood in America, unless you give me authority for contradicting\r\nit. I therefore write you this letter, to propose to you to send me\r\ncopies of any letters you have written, that may remove that suspicion.\r\nIn the preface to the second part of the Age of Reason, I have given a\r\nmemorandum from the hand-writing of Robespierre, in which he proposed a\r\ndecree of accusation against me, '_for the interests of America as well\r\nas of France!_' He could have no cause for putting America in the\r\ncase, but by interpreting the silence of the American government into\r\nconnivance and consent. I was imprisoned on the ground of being born\r\nin England; and your silence in not enquiring into the cause of that\r\nimprisonment, and reclaiming me against it, was tacitly giving me up. I\r\nought not to have suspected you of treachery; but whether I recover\r\nfrom the illness I now suffer or not, I shall continue to think you\r\ntreacherous, till you give me cause to think otherwise. I am sure you\r\nwould have found yourself more at your ease, had you acted by me as\r\nyou ought; for whether your desertion of me was intended to gratify the\r\nEnglish Government, or to let me fall into destruction in France that\r\nyou might exclaim the louder against the French Revolution, or whether\r\nyou hoped by my extinction to meet with less opposition in mounting up\r\nthe American government--either of these will involve you in reproach\r\nyou will not easily shake off.\r\n\r\n\"THOMAS Paine.\"\r\n\r\n     1 Washington Papers in State Department. Endorsed by Bache:\r\n     \"Jan. 18, 1796. Enclosed to Benj. Franklin Bache, and by him\r\n     forwarded immediately upon receipt.\"--_Editor._.\r\n\r\nHere follows the letter above alluded to, which I had stopped in\r\ncomplaisance to Mr. Monroe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Paris, February aad, 1795.\r\n\r\n\"Sir,\r\n\r\n\"As it is always painful to reproach those one would wish to respect, it\r\nis not without some difficulty that I have taken the resolution to\r\nwrite to you. The dangers to which I have been exposed cannot have been\r\nunknown to you, and the guarded silence you have observed upon that\r\ncircumstance is what I ought not to have expected from you, either as a\r\nfriend or as President of the United States.\r\n\r\n\"You knew enough of my character to be assured that I could not have\r\ndeserved imprisonment in France; and, without knowing any thing more\r\nthan this, you had sufficient ground to have taken some interest for my\r\nsafety. Every motive arising from recollection of times past, ought to\r\nhave suggested to you the propriety of such a measure. But I cannot find\r\nthat you have so much as directed any enquiry to be made whether I\r\nwas in prison or at liberty, dead or alive; what the cause of that\r\nimprisonment was, or whether there was any service or assistance you\r\ncould render. Is this what I ought to have expected from America, after\r\nthe part I had acted towards her, or will it redound to her honour or\r\nto yours, that I tell the story? I do not hesitate to say, that you have\r\nnot served America with more disinterestedness, or greater zeal, or more\r\nfidelity, than myself, and I know not if with better effect. After the\r\nrevolution of America was established I ventured into new scenes\r\nof difficulties to extend the principles which that revolution had\r\nproduced, and you rested at home to partake of the advantages. In the\r\nprogress of events, you beheld yourself a President in America, and me a\r\nprisoner in France. You folded your arms, forgot your friend, and became\r\nsilent.\r\n\r\n\"As every thing I have been doing in Europe was connected with my wishes\r\nfor the prosperity of America, I ought to be the more surprised at this\r\nconduct on the part of her government. It leaves me but one mode of\r\nexplanation, which is, _that every thing is not as it ought to be\r\namongst you_, and that the presence of a man who might disapprove, and\r\nwho had credit enough with the country to be heard and believed, was not\r\nwished for. This was the operating motive with the despotic faction\r\nthat imprisoned me in France, (though the pretence was, that I was a\r\nforeigner,) and those that have been silent and inactive towards me\r\nin America, appear to me to have acted from the same motive. It is\r\nimpossible for me to discover any other.(1)\r\n\r\n\"After the part I have taken in the revolution of America, it is\r\nnatural that I feel interested in whatever relates to her character\r\nand prosperity. Though I am not on the spot to see what is immediately\r\nacting there, I see some part of what she is acting in Europe. For\r\nyour own sake, as well as for that of America, I was both surprised\r\nand concerned at the appointment of Gouverneur Morris to be Minister\r\nto France. His conduct has proved that the opinion I had formed of that\r\nappointment was well founded. I wrote that opinion to Mr. Jefferson at\r\nthe time, and I was frank enough to say the same thing to Morris--_that\r\nit was an unfortunate appointment?_ His prating, insignificant\r\npomposity, rendered him at once offensive, suspected, and ridiculous;\r\nand his total neglect of all business had so disgusted the Americans,\r\nthat they proposed drawing up a protest against him. He carried this\r\nneglect to such an extreme, that it was necessary to inform him of it;\r\nand I asked him one day, if he did not feel himself ashamed to take the\r\nmoney of the country, and do nothing for it?' But Morris is so fond of\r\nprofit and voluptousness, that he cares nothing about character. Had\r\nhe not been removed at the time he was, I think his conduct would have\r\nprecipitated the two countries into a rupture; and in this case,\r\nhated _systematically_ as America is and ever will be by the British\r\ngovernment, and at the same time suspected by France, the commerce of\r\nAmerica would have fallen a prey to both countries.\r\n\r\n     1 This paragraph of the original letter was omitted from the\r\n     American pamphlet, probably by the prudence of Mr. Bache.--\r\n     _Editor._\r\n\r\n     2 \"I have just heard of Gouverneur Morris's appointment. It\r\n     is a most unfortunate one; and, as I shall mention the same\r\n     thing to him when I see him, I do not express it to you with\r\n     the injunction of confidence.\"--Paine to Jefferson, Feb.\r\n     13,1792.--_Editor._\r\n\r\n     3  Paine could not of course know that Morris was willing\r\n     that the Americans, to whom he alludes, captains of captured\r\n     vessels, should suffer, in order that there might be a case\r\n     against France of violation of treaty, which would leave the\r\n     United States free to transfer the alliance to England. See\r\n     Introduction to XXI.. also my \"Life of Paine,\" ii., p.\r\n     83.--_Editor._.\r\n\r\n\"If the inconsistent conduct of Morris exposed the interest of America\r\nto some hazard in France, the pusillanimous conduct of Mr. Jay in\r\nEngland has rendered the American government contemptible in Europe.\r\nIs it possible that any man who has contributed to the independence of\r\nAmer-ica, and to free her from the tyranny and injustice of the British\r\ngovernment, can read without shame and indignation the note of Jay to\r\nGrenville? It is a satire upon the declaration of Independence, and an\r\nencouragement to the British government to treat America with contempt.\r\nAt the time this Minister of Petitions was acting this miserable part,\r\nhe had every means in his hands to enable him to have done his business\r\nas he ought. The success or failure of his mission depended upon the\r\nsuccess or failure of the French arms. Had France failed, Mr. Jay might\r\nhave put his humble petition in his pocket, and gone home. The case\r\nhappened to be otherwise, and he has sacrificed the honour and perhaps\r\nall the advantages of it, by turning petitioner. I take it for granted,\r\nthat he was sent over to demand indemnification for the captured\r\nproperty; and, in this case, if he thought he wanted a preamble to his\r\ndemand, he might have said,\r\n\r\n'That, tho' the government of England might suppose itself under\r\nthe necessity of seizing American property bound to France, yet\r\nthat supposed necessity could not preclude indemnification to the\r\nproprietors, who, acting under the authority of their own government,\r\nwere not accountable to any other.'\r\n\r\n\"But Mr. Jay sets out with an implied recognition of the right of the\r\nBritish government to seize and condemn: for he enters his complaint\r\nagainst the _irregularity_ of the seizures and the condemnation, as if\r\nthey were reprehensible only by not being _conformable_ to the _terms_\r\nof the proclamation under which they were seized. Instead of being the\r\nEnvoy of a government, he goes over like a lawyer to demand a new trial.\r\nI can hardly help thinking that Grenville wrote that note himself and\r\nJay signed it; for the style of it is domestic and not diplomatic.\r\nThe term, _His_ Majesty, used without any descriptive epithet, always\r\nsignifies the King whom the Minister that speaks represents. If this\r\nsinking of the demand into a petition was a juggle between Grenville\r\nand Jay, to cover the indemnification, I think it will end in another\r\njuggle, that of never paying the money, and be made use of afterwards to\r\npreclude the right of demanding it: for Mr. Jay has virtually disowned\r\nthe right _by appealing to the magnanimity of his Majesty against the\r\ncapturers_. He has made this magnanimous Majesty the umpire in the case,\r\nand the government of the United States must abide by the decision. If,\r\nSir, I turn some part of this business into ridicule, it is to avoid the\r\nunpleasant sensation of serious indignation.\r\n\r\n\"Among other things which I confess I do not understand, is the\r\nproclamation of neutrality. This has always appeared to me as\r\nan assumption on the part of the executive not warranted by the\r\nConstitution. But passing this over, as a disputable case, and\r\nconsidering it only as political, the consequence has been that of\r\nsustaining the losses of war, without the balance of reprisals. When\r\nthe profession of neutrality, on the part of America, was answered by\r\nhostilities on the part of Britain, the object and intention of that\r\nneutrality existed no longer; and to maintain it after this, was not\r\nonly to encourage farther insults and depredations, but was an informal\r\nbreach of neutrality towards France, by passively contributing to the\r\naid of her enemy. That the government of England considered the American\r\ngovernment as pusillanimous, is evident from the encreasing insolence of\r\nthe conduct of the former towards the latter, till the affair of General\r\nWayne. She then saw that it might be possible to kick a government into\r\nsome degree of spirit.(1) So far as the proclamation of neutrality was\r\nintended to prevent a dissolute spirit of privateering in America under\r\nforeign colors, it was undoubtedly laudable; but to continue it as a\r\ngovernment neutrality, after the commerce of America was made war upon,\r\nwas submission and not neutrality. I have heard so much about this thing\r\ncalled neutrality, that I know not if the ungenerous and dishonorable\r\nsilence (for I must call it such,) that has been observed by your part\r\nof the government towards me, during my imprisonment, has not in some\r\nmeasure arisen from that policy.\r\n\r\n     1 Wayne's success against the Indians of the Six Nations,\r\n     1794, was regarded by Washington also as a check on England.\r\n     Writing to Pendleton, Jan. 22, 1795, he says: \"There is\r\n     reason to believe that the Indians...._together with their\r\n     abettors_; begin to see things in a different point of\r\n     view.\" (Italics mine).--_Editor._\r\n\r\n\"Tho' I have written you this letter, you ought not to suppose it has\r\nbeen an agreeable undertaking to me. On the contrary, I assure you, it\r\nhas caused me some disquietude. I am sorry you have given me cause to\r\ndo it; for, as I have always remembered your former friendship with\r\npleasure, I suffer a loss by your depriving me of that sentiment.\r\n\r\n\"Thomas Paine.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThat this letter was not written in very good temper, is very evident;\r\nbut it was just such a letter as his conduct appeared to me to merit,\r\nand every thing on his part since has served to confirm that\r\nopinion. Had I wanted a commentary on his silence, with respect to my\r\nimprisonment in France, some of his faction have furnished me with it.\r\nWhat I here allude to, is a publication in a Philadelphia paper, copied\r\nafterwards into a New York paper, both under the patronage of the\r\nWashington faction, in which the writer, still supposing me in prison\r\nin France, wonders at my lengthy respite from the scaffold; and he marks\r\nhis politics still farther, by saying:\r\n\r\n\"It appears, moreover, that the people of England did not relish his\r\n(Thomas Paine's) opinions quite so well as he expected, and that for one\r\nof his last pieces, as destructive to the peace and happiness of their\r\ncountry, (meaning, I suppose, the _Rights of Man_,) they threatened\r\nour knight-errant with such serious vengeance, that, to avoid a trip to\r\nBotany Bay, he fled over to France, as a less dangerous voyage.\"\r\n\r\nI am not refuting or contradicting the falsehood of this publication,\r\nfor it is sufficiently notorious; neither am I censuring the writer: on\r\nthe contrary, I thank him for the explanation he has incautiously given\r\nof the principles of the Washington faction. Insignificant, however, as\r\nthe piece is, it was capable of having some ill effects, had it arrived\r\nin France during my imprisonment, and in the time of Robespierre; and I\r\nam not uncharitable in supposing that this was one of the intentions of\r\nthe writer.(*)\r\n\r\n     * I know not who the writer of the piece is, but some of the\r\n     Americans say it is Phineas Bond, an American refugee, but\r\n     now a British consul; and that he writes under the\r\n     signature of Peter Skunk or Peter Porcupine, or some such\r\n     signature.--Author.\r\n\r\n     This footnote probably added to the gall of Porcupine's\r\n     (Cobbett's) \"Letter to the Infamous Tom Paine, in Answer to\r\n     his Letter to General Washington\" (Polit. Censor, Dec.,\r\n     1796), of which he (Cobbett) afterwards repented. Phineas\r\n     Bond had nothing to do with it.--Editor.\r\n\r\nI have now done with Mr. Washington on the score of private affairs. It\r\nwould have been far more agreeable to me, had his conduct been such as\r\nnot to have merited these reproaches. Errors or caprices of the temper\r\ncan be pardoned and forgotten; but a cold deliberate crime of the heart,\r\nsuch as Mr. Washington is capable of acting, is not to be washed away. I\r\nnow proceed to other matter.\r\n\r\nAfter Jay's note to Grenville arrived in Paris from America, the\r\ncharacter of every thing that was to follow might be easily foreseen;\r\nand it was upon this anticipation that _my_ letter of February the 22d\r\nwas founded. The event has proved that I was not mistaken, except that\r\nit has been much worse than I expected.\r\n\r\nIt would naturally occur to Mr. Washington, that the secrecy of Jay's\r\nmission to England, where there was already an American Minister, could\r\nnot but create some suspicion in the French government; especially\r\nas the conduct of Morris had been notorious, and the intimacy of Mr.\r\nWashington with Morris was known.\r\n\r\nThe character which Mr. Washington has attempted to act in the world, is\r\na sort of non-describable, camelion-colored thing, called _prudence_. It\r\nis, in many cases, a substitute for principle, and is so nearly allied\r\nto hypocrisy that it easily slides into it. His genius for prudence\r\nfurnished him in this instance with an expedient that served, as is\r\nthe natural and general character of all expedients, to diminish the\r\nembarrassments of the moment and multiply them afterwards; for\r\nhe authorized it to be made known to the French government, as a\r\nconfidential matter, (Mr. Washington should recollect that I was a\r\nmember of the Convention, and had the means of knowing what I here\r\nstate) he authorized it, I say, to be announced, and that for the\r\npurpose of preventing any uneasiness to France on the score of Mr. Jay's\r\nmission to England, that the object of that mission, and of Mr. Jay's\r\nauthority, was restricted to that of demanding the surrender of the\r\nwestern posts, and indemnification for the cargoes captured in American\r\nvessels. Mr. Washington knows that this was untrue; and knowing this,\r\nhe had good reason to himself for refusing to furnish the House of\r\nRepresentatives with copies of the instructions given to Jay, as he\r\nmight suspect, among other things, that he should also be called upon\r\nfor copies of instructions given to other Ministers, and that, in\r\nthe contradiction of instructions, his want of integrity would be\r\ndetected.(1) Mr. Washington may now, perhaps, learn, when it is too late\r\nto be of any use to him, that a man will pass better through the world\r\nwith a thousand open errors upon his back, than in being detected in\r\n_one_ sly falsehood. When one is detected, a thousand are suspected.\r\n\r\nThe first account that arrived in Paris of a treaty being negotiated by\r\nMr. Jay, (for nobody suspected any,) came in an English newspaper, which\r\nannounced that a treaty _offensive and defensive_ had been concluded\r\nbetween the United States of America and England. This was immediately\r\ndenied by every American in Paris, as an impossible thing; and though\r\nit was disbelieved by the French, it imprinted a suspicion that some\r\nunderhand business was going forward.(*) At length the treaty itself\r\narrived, and every well-affected American blushed with shame.\r\n\r\n     1 When the British treaty had been ratified by the Senate\r\n     (with one stipulation) and signed by the President, the\r\n     House of Representatives, required to supply the means for\r\n     carrying into effect, believed that its power over the\r\n     supplies authorized it to check what a large majority\r\n     considered an outrage on the country and on France. This was\r\n     the opinion of Edmund Randolph (the first Attorney General),\r\n     of Jefferson, Madison, and other eminent men. The House\r\n     having respectfully requested the President to send them\r\n     such papers on the treaty as would not affect any existing\r\n     negotiations, he refused in a message (March 30, 1796),\r\n     whose tenor Madison described as \"improper and indelicate.\"\r\n     He said \"the assent of the House of Representatives is not\r\n     necessary to the validity of a treaty.\" The House regarded\r\n     the message as menacing a serious conflict, and receded.--\r\n     _Editor._\r\n\r\n     * It was the embarrassment into which the affairs and credit\r\n     of America were thrown at this instant by the report above\r\n     alluded to, that made it necessary to contradict it, and\r\n     that by every means arising from opinion or founded upon\r\n     authority. The Committee of Public Safety, existing at that\r\n     time, had agreed to the full execution, on their part, of\r\n     the treaty between America and France, notwithstanding some\r\n     equivocal conduct on the part of the American government,\r\n     not very consistent with the good faith of an ally; but they\r\n     were not in a disposition to be imposed upon by a counter-\r\n     treaty. That Jay had no instructions beyond the points above\r\n     stated, or none that could possibly be construed to extend\r\n     to the length the British treaty goes, was a matter believed\r\n     in America, in England, and in France; and without going to\r\n     any other source it followed naturally from the message of\r\n     the President to Congress, when he nominated Jay upon that\r\n     mission. The secretary of Mr. Jay came to Paris soon after\r\n     the treaty with England had been concluded, and brought with\r\n     him a copy of Mr. Jay's instructions, which he offered to\r\n     shew to me as _justification of Jay_. I advised him, as a\r\n     friend, not to shew them to anybody, and did not permit him\r\n     to shew them to me. \"Who is it,\" said I to him, \"that you\r\n     intend to implicate as censureable by shewing those\r\n     instructions? Perhaps that implication may fall upon your\r\n     own government.\" Though I did not see the instructions, I\r\n     could not be at a loss to understand that the American\r\n     administration had been playing a double game.--Author.\r\n\r\n     That there was a \"double game\" in this business, from first\r\n     to last, is now a fact of history. Jay was confirmed by the\r\n     Senate on a declaration of the President in which no\r\n     faintest hint of a treaty was given, but only the\r\n     \"adjustment of our complaints,\" \"vindication of our rights,\"\r\n     and cultivation of \"peace.\" Only after the Envoy's\r\n     confirmation did the Cabinet add the main thing, his\r\n     authority to negotiate a commercial treaty. This was done\r\n     against the protest of the only lawyer among them, Edmund\r\n     Randolph, Secretary of State, who said the exercise of such\r\n     a power by Jay would be an abridgment of the rights of the\r\n     Senate and of the nation. See my \"Life of Randolph,\" p. 220.\r\n     For Jay's Instructions, etc., see I. Am. State Papers,\r\n     Foreign Relations.--Editor.\r\n\r\nIt is curious to observe, how the appearance of characters will change,\r\nwhilst the root that produces them remains the same. The Washington\r\nfaction having waded through the slough of negociation, and whilst it\r\namused France with professions of friendship contrived to injure her,\r\nimmediately throws off the hypocrite, and assumes the swaggering air of\r\na bravado. The party papers of that imbecile administration were on\r\nthis occasion filled with paragraphs about _Sovereignty_. A paltroon may\r\nboast of his sovereign right to let another kick him, and this is the\r\nonly kind of sovereignty shewn in the treaty with England. But those\r\ndaring paragraphs, as Timothy Pickering(1) well knows, were intended\r\nfor France; without whose assistance, in men, money, and ships, Mr.\r\nWashington would have cut but a poor figure in the American war. But of\r\nhis military talents I shall speak hereafter.\r\n\r\nI mean not to enter into any discussion of any article of Jay's treaty;\r\nI shall speak only upon the whole of it. It is attempted to be justified\r\non the ground of its not being a violation of any article or articles\r\nof the treaty pre-existing with France. But the sovereign right of\r\nexplanation does not lie with George Washington and his man Timothy;\r\nFrance, on her part, has, at least, an equal right: and when nations\r\ndispute, it is not so much about words as about things.\r\n\r\nA man, such as the world calls a sharper, and versed as Jay must be\r\nsupposed to be in the quibbles of the law, may find a way to enter into\r\nengagements, and make bargains, in such a manner as to cheat some other\r\nparty, without that party being able, as the phrase is, _to take the law\r\nof him_. This often happens in the cabalistical circle of what is called\r\nlaw. But when this is attempted to be acted on the national scale of\r\ntreaties, it is too despicable to be defended, or to be permitted to\r\nexist. Yet this is the trick upon which Jay's treaty is founded, so\r\nfar as it has relation to the treaty pre-existing with France. It is a\r\ncounter-treaty to that treaty, and perverts all the great articles of\r\nthat treaty to the injury of France, and makes them operate as a bounty\r\nto England, with whom France is at war.\r\n\r\n     1 Secretary of State.--_Editor._.\r\n\r\nThe Washington administration shews great desire that the treaty between\r\nFrance and the United States be preserved. Nobody can doubt their\r\nsincerity upon this matter. There is not a British Minister, a British\r\nmerchant, or a British agent or sailor in America, that does not\r\nanxiously wish the same thing. The treaty with France serves now as\r\na passport to supply England with naval stores and other articles of\r\nAmerican produce, whilst the same articles, when coming to France, are\r\nmade contraband or seizable by Jay's treaty with England. The treaty\r\nwith France says, that neutral ships make neutral property, and thereby\r\ngives protection to English property on board American ships; and Jay's\r\ntreaty delivers up French property on board American ships to be seized\r\nby the English. It is too paltry to talk of faith, of national honour,\r\nand of the preservation of treaties, whilst such a bare-faced treachery\r\nas this stares the world in the face.\r\n\r\nThe Washington administration may save itself the trouble of proving to\r\nthe French government its _most faithful_ intentions of preserving\r\nthe treaty with France; for France has now no desire that it should be\r\npreserved. She had nominated an Envoy extraordinary to America, to make\r\nMr. Washington and his government a present of the treaty, and to\r\nhave no more to do with _that_, or with _him_. It was at the same time\r\nofficially declared to the American Minister at Paris, _that the French\r\nRepublic had rather have the American government for an open enemy\r\nthan a treacherous friend_. This, sir, together with the internal\r\ndistractions caused in America, and the loss of character in the world,\r\nis the _eventful crisis_, alluded to in the beginning of this letter, to\r\nwhich your double politics have brought the affairs of your country. It\r\nis time that the eyes of America be opened upon you.\r\n\r\nHow France would have conducted herself towards America and American\r\ncommerce, after all treaty stipulations had ceased, and under the sense\r\nof services rendered and injuries received, I know not. It is, however,\r\nan unpleasant reflection, that in all national quarrels, the innocent,\r\nand even the friendly part of the community, become involved with the\r\nculpable and the unfriendly; and as the accounts that arrived from\r\nAmerica continued to manifest an invariable attachment in the general\r\nmass of the people to their original ally, in opposition to the\r\nnew-fangled Washington faction,--the resolutions that had been taken\r\nin France were suspended. It happened also, fortunately enough, that\r\nGouverneur Morris was not Minister at this time.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, one point that still remains in embryo, and\r\nwhich, among other things, serves to shew the ignorance of Washington\r\ntreaty-makers, and their inattention to preexisting treaties, when they\r\nwere employing themselves in framing or ratifying the new treaty with\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nThe second article of the treaty of commerce between the United States\r\nand France says:\r\n\r\n\"The most christian king and the United States engage mutually, not to\r\ngrant any particular favour to other nations in respect of commerce and\r\nnavigation that shall not immediately become common to the other party,\r\nwho shall enjoy the same favour freely, if the concession was freely\r\nmade, or on allowing the same compensation if the concession was\r\nconditional.\"\r\n\r\nAll the concessions, therefore, made to England by Jay's treaty are,\r\nthrough the medium of this second article in the pre-existing treaty,\r\nmade to France, and become engrafted into the treaty with France, and\r\ncan be exercised by her as a matter of right, the same as by England.\r\n\r\nJay's treaty makes a concession to England, and that unconditionally,\r\nof seizing naval stores in American ships, and condemning them as\r\ncontraband. It makes also a concession to England to seize provisions\r\nand _other articles_ in American ships. _Other articles are all other\r\narticles_, and none but an ignoramus, or something worse, would have put\r\nsuch a phrase into a treaty. The condition annexed in this case is, that\r\nthe provisions and other articles so seized, are to be paid for at a\r\nprice to be agreed upon. Mr. Washington, as President, ratified\r\nthis treaty after he knew the British Government had recommended an\r\nindiscriminate seizure of provisions and all other articles in American\r\nships; and it is now known that those seizures were made to fit out the\r\nexpedition going to Quiberon Bay, and it was known before hand that they\r\nwould be made. The evidence goes also a good way to prove that Jay and\r\nGrenville understood each other upon that subject. Mr. Pinckney,(1)\r\nwhen he passed through France on his way to Spain, spoke of the\r\nrecommencement of the seizures as a thing that would take place.\r\n\r\n     1 Gen. Thomas Pinckney, U. S. Minister to England.--\r\n     _Editor._\r\n\r\nThe French government had by some means received information from London\r\nto the same purpose, with the addition, that the recommencement of\r\nthe seizures would cause no misunderstanding between the British and\r\nAmerican governments. Grenville, in defending himself against the\r\nopposition in Parliament, on account of the scarcity of corn, said (see\r\nhis speech at the opening of the Parliament that met October 29, 1795)\r\nthat _the supplies for the Quiberon expedition were furnished out of the\r\nAmerican ships_, and all the accounts received at that time from\r\nEngland stated that those seizures were made under the treaty. After the\r\nsupplies for the Quiberon expedition had been procured, and the expected\r\nsuccess had failed, the seizures were countermanded; and had the French\r\nseized provision vessels going to England, it is probable that the\r\nQuiberon expedition could not have been attempted.\r\n\r\nIn one point of view, the treaty with England operates as a loan to\r\nthe English government. It gives permission to that government to take\r\nAmerican property at sea, to any amount, and pay for it when it suits\r\nher; and besides this, the treaty is in every point of view a surrender\r\nof the rights of American commerce and navigation, and a refusal to\r\nFrance of the rights of neutrality. The American flag is not now a\r\nneutral flag to France; Jay's treaty of surrender gives a monopoly of it\r\nto England.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, the treaty of commerce between America and France\r\nwas formed on the most liberal principles, and calculated to give the\r\ngreatest encouragement to the infant commerce of America. France was\r\nneither a carrier nor an exporter of naval stores or of provisions.\r\nThose articles belonged wholly to America, and they had all the\r\nprotection in that treaty which a treaty could give. But so much has\r\nthat treaty been perverted, that the liberality of it on the part\r\nof France, has served to encourage Jay to form a counter-treaty with\r\nEngland; for he must have supposed the hands of France tied up by her\r\ntreaty with America, when he was making such large concessions in favour\r\nof England. The injury which Mr. Washington's administration has done to\r\nthe character as well as to the commerce of America, is too great to be\r\nrepaired by him. Foreign nations will be shy of making treaties with\r\na government that has given the faithless example of perverting the\r\nliberality of a former treaty to the injury of the party with whom it\r\nwas made.(1)\r\n\r\n     1 For an analysis of the British Treaty see Wharton's\r\n     \"Digest of the International Law of the United States,\" vol.\r\n     it, § 150 a. Paine's analysis is perfectly correct.--\r\n     _Editor._.\r\n\r\nIn what a fraudulent light must Mr. Washington's character appear in the\r\nworld, when his declarations and his conduct are compared together! Here\r\nfollows the letter he wrote to the Committee of Public Safety, while Jay\r\nwas negotiating in profound secrecy this treacherous treaty:\r\n\r\n\"George Washington, President of the United States of America, to the\r\nRepresentatives of the French people, members of the Committee of Public\r\nSafety of the French Republic, the great and good friend and ally of the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\n\"On the intimation of the wish of the French republic that à new\r\nMinister should be sent from the United States, I resolved to manifest\r\nmy sense of the readiness with which _my_ request was fulfilled, [that\r\nof recalling Genet,] by immediately fulfilling the request of your\r\ngovernment, [that of recalling Morris].\r\n\r\n\"It was some time before a character could be obtained, worthy of the\r\nhigh office of expressing the attachment of the United States to\r\nthe happiness of our allies, _and drawing closer the bonds of our\r\nfriendship_. I have now made choice of James Monroe, one of our\r\ndistinguished citizens, to reside near the French republic, in quality\r\nof Minister Plenipotentiary of the United States of America. He is\r\ninstructed to bear to you our _sincere solicitude for your welfare, and\r\nto cultivate with teal the cordiality so happily subsisting between\r\nus_. From a knowledge of his fidelity, probity, and good conduct, I have\r\nentire confidence that he will render himself acceptable to you,\r\nand give effect to your desire of preserving and _advancing, on all\r\noccasions, the interest and connection of the two nations_. I beseech\r\nyou, therefore, to give full credence to whatever he shall say to you\r\non the part of the United States, and _most of all, when he shall assure\r\nyou that your prosperity is an object of our affection_.\r\n\r\n\"And I pray God to have the French Republic in his holy keeping.\r\n\r\n\"G. Washington.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWas it by entering into a treaty with England to surrender French\r\nproperty on board American ships to be seized by the English, while\r\nEnglish property on board American ships was declared by the French\r\ntreaty not to be seizable, _that the bonds of friendship between America\r\nand France were to be drawn the closer?_ Was it by declaring naval\r\nstores contraband when coming to France, whilst by the French treaty\r\nthey were not contraband when going to England, that the _connection\r\nbetween France and America was to be advanced?_ Was it by opening the\r\nAmerican ports to the British navy in the present war, from which ports\r\nthe same navy had been expelled by the aid solicited from France in the\r\nAmerican war (and that aid gratuitously given) (2) that the gratitude\r\nof America was to be shewn, and the _solicitude_ spoken of in the letter\r\ndemonstrated?\r\n\r\n     1 The italics are Paine's. Paine's free use of this document\r\n     suggests that he possessed the confidence of the French\r\n     Directory.--_Editor._\r\n\r\n     2  It is notable that Paine adheres to his old contention in\r\n     his controversy with Deane. See vol. i., ch. aa of this work;\r\n     and vol. i., ch. 9 of my \"Life of Paine.\"--_Editor._.\r\n\r\nAs the letter was addressed to the Committee of Public Safety, Mr.\r\nWashington did not expect it would get abroad in the world, or be seen\r\nby any other eye than that of Robespierre, or be heard by any other ear\r\nthan that of the Committee; that it would pass as a whisper across the\r\nAtlantic, from one dark chamber to the other, and there terminate. It\r\nwas calculated to remove from the mind of the Committee all suspicion\r\nupon Jay's mission to England, and, in this point of view, it was suited\r\nto the circumstances of the movement then passing; but as the event\r\nof that mission has proved the letter to be hypocritical, it serves no\r\nother purpose of the present moment than to shew that the writer is\r\nnot to be credited. Two circumstances serve to make the reading of the\r\nletter necessary in the Convention. The one was, that they who succeeded\r\non the fall of Robespierre, found it most proper to act with publicity;\r\nthe other, to extinguish the suspicions which the strange conduct of\r\nMorris had occasioned in France.\r\n\r\nWhen the British treaty, and the ratification of it by Mr. Washington,\r\nwas known in France, all further declarations from him of his good\r\ndisposition as an ally and friend, passed for so many cyphers; but still\r\nit appeared necessary to him to keep up the farce of declarations. It\r\nis stipulated in the British treaty, that commissioners are to report\r\nat the end of two years, on the case of _neutral ships making neutral\r\nproperty_. In the mean time, neutral ships do _not_ make neutral\r\nproperty, according to the British treaty, and they _do_ according to\r\nthe French treaty. The preservation, therefore, of the French treaty\r\nbecame of great importance to England, as by that means she can employ\r\nAmerican ships as carriers, whilst the same advantage is denied to\r\nFrance. Whether the French treaty could exist as a matter of right after\r\nthis clandestine perversion of it, could not but give some apprehensions\r\nto the partizans of the British treaty, and it became necessary to them\r\nto make up, by fine words, what was wanting in good actions.\r\n\r\nAn opportunity offered to that purpose. The Convention, on the public\r\nreception of Mr. Monroe, ordered the American flag and the French flags\r\nto be displayed unitedly in the hall of the Convention. Mr. Monroe made\r\na present of an American flag for the purpose. The Convention returned\r\nthis compliment by sending a French flag to America, to be presented by\r\ntheir Minister, Mr. Adet, to the American government. This resolution\r\npassed long before Jay's treaty was known or suspected: it passed in\r\nthe days of confidence; but the flag was not presented by Mr. Adet till\r\nseveral months after the treaty had been ratified. Mr. Washington made\r\nthis the occasion of saying some fine things to the French Minister; and\r\nthe better to get himself into tune to do this, he began by saying the\r\nfinest things of himself.\r\n\r\n\"Born, sir (said he) in a land of liberty; _having_ early learned its\r\nvalue; _having_ engaged in a perilous conflict to defend it; _having_,\r\nin a word, devoted the best years of my life to secure its permanent\r\nestablishment in my own country; _my_ anxious recollections, my\r\nsympathetic feelings, and _my_ best wishes are irresistibly excited,\r\nwhenever, in any country, I see an oppressed people unfurl the banner of\r\nfreedom.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Washington, having expended so many fine phrases upon himself, was\r\nobliged to invent a new one for the French, and he calls them \"wonderful\r\npeople!\" The coalesced powers acknowledged as much.\r\n\r\nIt is laughable to hear Mr. Washington talk of his _sympathetic\r\nfeelings_, who has always been remarked, even among his friends, for\r\nnot having any. He has, however, given no proofs of any to me. As to the\r\npompous encomiums he so liberally pays to himself, on the score of the\r\nAmerican revolution, the reality of them may be questioned; and since\r\nhe has forced them so much into notice, it is fair to examine his\r\npretensions.\r\n\r\nA stranger might be led to suppose, from the egotism with which Mr.\r\nWashington speaks, that himself, and himself only, had generated,\r\nconducted, compleated, and established the revolution: In fine, that it\r\nwas all his own doing.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, as to the political part, he had no share in it;\r\nand, therefore, the whole of _that_ is out of the question with respect\r\nto him. There remains, then, only the military part; and it would have\r\nbeen prudent in Mr. Washington not to have awakened enquiry upon that\r\nsubject. Fame then was cheap; he enjoyed it cheaply; and nobody was\r\ndisposed to take away the laurels that, whether they were _acquired_ or\r\nnot, had been _given_.\r\n\r\nMr. Washington's merit consisted in constancy. But constancy was the\r\ncommon virtue of the revolution. Who was there that was inconstant? I\r\nknow but of one military defection, that of Arnold; and I know of no\r\npolitical defection, among those who made themselves eminent when the\r\nrevolution was formed by the declaration of independence. Even Silas\r\nDeane, though he attempted to defraud, did not betray.(1)\r\n\r\n     1 This generous judgment by Deane's old adversary has become\r\n     questionable under recent investigations.--_Editor._.\r\n\r\nBut when we speak of military character, something more is to be\r\nunderstood than constancy; and something more _ought_ to be understood\r\nthan the Fabian system of _doing nothing_. The _nothing_ part can be\r\ndone by any body. Old Mrs. Thompson, the housekeeper of head quarters,\r\n(who threatened to make the sun and the wind shine through Rivington of\r\nNew York,) 'could have done it as well as Mr. Washington. Deborah would\r\nhave been as good as Barak.\r\n\r\nMr. Washington had the nominal rank of Commander in Chief, but he was\r\nnot so in fact. He had, in reality, only a separate command. He had no\r\ncontroul over, or direction of, the army to the northward under Gates,\r\nthat captured Burgoyne; nor of that to the south under [Nathaniel]\r\nGreene, that recovered the southern States.(2) The nominal rank,\r\nhowever, of Commander in Chief, served to throw upon him the lustre\r\nof those actions, and to make him appear as the soul and centre of all\r\nmilitary operations in America.\r\n\r\n     1 The Tory publisher of New York City, whose press was\r\n     destroyed in 1775 by a mob of Connecticut soldiers.--\r\n     _Editor._\r\n\r\n     2 See Mr. Winterbotham's valuable History of America, lately\r\n     published.--Author. [The \"History of the Establishment of\r\n     Independence\" is contained in the first of Mr.\r\n     Winterbotham's four volumes (London, 1795).--_Editor._.]\r\n\r\nHe commenced his command June, 1775, during the time the Massachusetts\r\narmy lay before Boston, and after the affair of Bunker-hill. The\r\ncommencement of his command was the commencement of inactivity. Nothing\r\nwas afterwards done, or attempted to be done, during the nine months\r\nhe remained before Boston. If we may judge from the resistance made at\r\nConcord, and afterwards at Bunker-hill, there was a spirit of enterprise\r\nat that time, which the presence of Mr. Washington chilled into cold\r\ndefence. By the advantage of a good exterior he attracts respect, which\r\nhis habitual silence tends to preserve; but he has not the talent of\r\ninspiring ardour in an army. The enemy removed from Boston in March\r\n1776, to wait for reinforcements from Europe, and to take a more\r\nadvantageous position at New York.\r\n\r\nThe inactivity of the campaign of 1775, on the part of General\r\nWashington, when the enemy had a less force than in any other future\r\nperiod of the war, and the injudicious choice of positions taken by\r\nhim in the campaign of 1776, when the enemy had its greatest force,\r\nnecessarily produced the losses and misfortunes that marked that gloomy\r\ncampaign. The positions taken were either islands or necks of land.\r\nIn the former, the enemy, by the aid of their ships, could bring their\r\nwhole force against apart of General Washington's, as in the affair\r\nof Long Island; and in the latter, he might be shut up as in the bottom\r\nof a bag. This had nearly been the case at New York, and it was so in\r\npart; it was actually the case at Fort Washington; and it would have\r\nbeen the case at Fort Lee, if General Greene had not moved precipitately\r\noff, leaving every thing behind, and by gaining Hackinsack bridge, got\r\nout of the bag of Bergen Neck. How far Mr. Washington, as General, is\r\nblameable for these matters, I am not undertaking to determine; but they\r\nare evidently defects in military geography. The successful skirmishes\r\nat the close of that campaign, (matters that would scarcely be noticed\r\nin a better state of things,) make the brilliant exploits of General\r\nWashington's seven campaigns. No wonder we see so much pusillanimity in\r\nthe President, when we see so little enterprise in the General!\r\n\r\nThe campaign of 1777 became famous, not by anything on the part of\r\nGeneral Washington, but by the capture of General Burgoyne, and the\r\narmy under his command, by the Northern army at Saratoga, under General\r\nGates. So totally distinct and unconnected were the two armies of\r\nWashington and Gates, and so independent was the latter of the authority\r\nof the nominal Commander in Chief, that the two Generals did not so much\r\nas correspond, and it was only by a letter of General (since Governor)\r\nClinton, that General Washington was informed of that event. The British\r\ntook possession of Philadelphia this year, which they evacuated\r\nthe next, just time enough to save their heavy baggage and fleet of\r\ntransports from capture by the French Admiral d'Estaing, who arrived at\r\nthe mouth of the Delaware soon after.\r\n\r\nThe capture of Burgoyne gave an eclat in Europe to the American arms,\r\nand facilitated the alliance with France. The eclat, however, was\r\nnot kept up by any thing on the part of General Washington. The same\r\nunfortunate languor that marked his entrance into the field, continued\r\nalways. Discontent began to prevail strongly against him, and a party\r\nwas formed in Congress, whilst sitting at York-town, in Pennsylvania,\r\nfor removing him from the command of the army. The hope, however,\r\nof better times, the news of the alliance with France, and the\r\nunwillingness of shewing discontent, dissipated the matter.\r\n\r\nNothing was done in the campaigns of 1778, 1779, 1780, in the part\r\nwhere General Washington commanded, except the taking of Stony Point by\r\nGeneral Wayne. The Southern States in the mean time were over-run by the\r\nenemy. They were afterwards recovered by General Greene, who had in a\r\nvery great measure created the army that accomplished that recovery.\r\nIn all this General Washington had no share. The Fabian system of war,\r\nfollowed by him, began now to unfold itself with all its evils; but\r\nwhat is Fabian war without Fabian means to support it? The finances of\r\nCongress depending wholly on emissions of paper money, were exhausted.\r\nIts credit was gone. The continental treasury was not able to pay the\r\nexpense of a brigade of waggons to transport the necessary stores to the\r\narmy, and yet the sole object, the establishment of the revolution,\r\nwas a thing of remote distance. The time I am now speaking of is in the\r\nlatter end of the year 1780.\r\n\r\nIn this situation of things it was found not only expedient, but\r\nabsolutely necessary, for Congress to state the whole case to its ally.\r\nI knew more of this matter, (before it came into Congress or was known\r\nto General Washington) of its progress, and its issue, than I chuse\r\nto state in this letter. Colonel John Laurens was sent to France as an\r\nEnvoy Extraordinary on this occasion, and by a private agreement between\r\nhim and me I accompanied him. We sailed from Boston in the Alliance\r\nfrigate, February 11th, 1781. France had already done much in accepting\r\nand paying bills drawn by Congress. She was now called upon to do more.\r\nThe event of Colonel Laurens's mission, with the aid of the venerable\r\nMinister, Franklin, was, that France gave in money, as a present, six\r\nmillions of livres, and ten millions more as a loan, and agreed to send\r\na fleet of not less than thirty sail of the line, at her own expense,\r\nas an aid to America. Colonel Laurens and myself returned from Brest the\r\n1st of June following, taking with us two millions and a half of livres\r\n(upwards of one hundred thousand pounds sterling) of the money given,\r\nand convoying two ships with stores.\r\n\r\nWe arrived at Boston the 25th of August following. De Grasse arrived\r\nwith the French fleet in the Chesapeak at the same time, and was\r\nafterwards joined by that of Barras, making 31 sail of the line.\r\nThe money was transported in waggons from Boston to the Bank at\r\nPhiladelphia, of which Mr. Thomas Willing, who has since put himself at\r\nthe head of the list of petitioners in favour of the British treaty, was\r\nthen President. And it was by the aid of this money, and this fleet, and\r\nof Rochambeau's army, that Cornwallis was taken; the laurels of which\r\nhave been unjustly given to Mr. Washington. His merit in that affair was\r\nno more than that of any other American officer.\r\n\r\nI have had, and still have, as much pride in the American revolution as\r\nany man, or as Mr. Washington has a right to have; but that pride has\r\nnever made me forgetful whence the great aid came that compleated\r\nthe business. Foreign aid (that of France) was calculated upon at the\r\ncommencement of the revolution. It is one of the subjects treated of\r\nin the pamphlet _Common Sense_, but as a matter that could not be hoped\r\nfor, unless independence was declared.1 The aid, however, was greater\r\nthan could have been expected.\r\n\r\nIt is as well the ingratitude as the pusillanimity of Mr. Washington,\r\nand the Washington faction, that has brought upon America the loss\r\nof character she now suffers in the world, and the numerous evils her\r\ncommerce has undergone, and to which it is yet exposed. The British\r\nMinistry soon found out what sort of men they had to deal with, and they\r\ndealt with them accordingly; and if further explanation was wanting, it\r\nhas been fully given since, in the snivelling address of the New York\r\nChamber of Commerce to the President, and in that of sundry merchants of\r\nPhiladelphia, which was not much better.\r\n\r\n     1  See vol. i. of this work, p. ixx. Paine was sharply taken\r\n     to task on this point by \"Cato.\"   Ib.% pp. 145-147.--\r\n     _Editor._.\r\n\r\nWhen the revolution of America was finally established by the\r\ntermination of the war, the world gave her credit for great character;\r\nand she had nothing to do but to stand firm upon that ground. The\r\nBritish ministry had their hands too full of trouble to have provoked\r\na rupture with her, had she shown a proper resolution to defend her\r\nrights. But encouraged as they were by the submissive character of the\r\nAmerican administration, they proceeded from insult to insult, till none\r\nmore were left to be offered. The proposals made by Sweden and Denmark\r\nto the American administration were disregarded. I know not if so much\r\nas an answer has been returned to them. The minister penitentiary,\r\n(as some of the British prints called him,) Mr. Jay, was sent on a\r\npilgrimage to London, to make up all by penance and petition. In the\r\nmean time the lengthy and drowsy writer of the pieces signed _Camillas_\r\nheld himself in reserve to vindicate every thing; and to sound in\r\nAmerica the tocsin of terror upon the inexhaustible resources of\r\nEngland. Her resources, says he, are greater than those of all the other\r\npowers. This man is so intoxicated with fear and finance, that he knows\r\nnot the difference between _plus_ and _minus_--between a hundred pounds\r\nin hand, and a hundred pounds worse than nothing.\r\n\r\nThe commerce of America, so far as it had been established by all the\r\ntreaties that had been formed prior to that by Jay, was free, and the\r\nprinciples upon which it was established were good. That ground ought\r\nnever to have been departed from. It was the justifiable ground\r\nof right, and no temporary difficulties ought to have induced an\r\nabandonment of it. The case is now otherwise. The ground, the scene, the\r\npretensions, the everything, are changed. The commerce of America is, by\r\nJay's treaty, put under foreign dominion. The sea is not free for her.\r\nHer right to navigate it is reduced to the right of escaping; that is,\r\nuntil some ship of England or France stops her vessels, and carries them\r\ninto port. Every article of American produce, whether from the sea or\r\nthe sand, fish, flesh, vegetable, or manufacture, is, by Jay's treaty,\r\nmade either contraband or seizable. Nothing is exempt. In all other\r\ntreaties of commerce, the article which enumerates the contraband\r\narticles, such as fire arms, gunpowder, &c, is followed by another\r\narticle which enumerates the articles not contraband: but it is not so\r\nin Jay's treaty. There is no exempting article. Its place is supplied by\r\nthe article for seizing and carrying into port; and the sweeping phrase\r\nof \"provisions and _other articles _\" includes every thing. There never\r\nwas such a base and servile treaty of surrender since treaties began to\r\nexist.\r\n\r\nThis is the ground upon which America now stands. All her rights\r\nof commerce and navigation are to begin anew, and that with loss of\r\ncharacter to begin with. If there is sense enough left in the heart\r\nto call a blush into the cheek, the Washington administration must\r\nbe ashamed to appear.--And as to you, Sir, treacherous in private\r\nfriendship (for so you have been to me, and that in the day of danger)\r\nand a hypocrite in public life, the world will be puzzled to decide\r\nwhether you are an apostate or an impostor; whether you have abandoned\r\ngood principles, or whether you ever had any.\r\n\r\nThomas Paine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIII. OBSERVATIONS.(1)\r\n\r\n     1 State Archives, Paris, États Unis, vol. 43, fol. 100.\r\n     Undated, but evidently written early in the year 1795, when\r\n     Jay's Treaty was as yet unknown. Paine was then staying in\r\n     the house of the American Minister, Monroe.--' Editor,\r\n\r\nThe United States of America are negociating with Spain respecting the\r\nfree Navigation of the Mississippi, and the territorial limits of this\r\nlarge river, in conformity with the Treaty of Peace with England dated\r\n30th November, 1782. As the brilliant successes of the French Republic\r\nhave forced England to grant us, what was in all justice our due, so the\r\ncontinuation of the prosperity of the Republic, will force Spain to make\r\na Treaty with us on the points in controversy.\r\n\r\nSince it is certain that all that we shall obtain from Spain will be due\r\nto the victories of France, and as the inhabitants of the western part\r\nof the United States (which part contains or covers more than half\r\nthe United States), have decided to claim their rights to the free\r\nnavigation of the Mississippi, would it not be a wiser policy for the\r\nRepublican Government (who have only to command to obtain) to arrogate\r\nall the merit, by making our demands to Spain, one of the conditions, of\r\nFrance, to consent to restore peace to the Castilians. They have only\r\nto declare, they will not make Peace, or that they will support with\r\nall their might, the just reclamations of their allies against these\r\nPowers,--against England for the surrender of the frontier posts, and\r\nfor the indemnities due through their depredations on our Trade, and\r\nagainst Spain for our territorial limits, and the free navigation of\r\nthe Mississippi. This declaration would certainly not prolong the War a\r\nsingle day more, nor cost the Republic an obole, whilst it would assure\r\nall the merit of success to France, and besides produce all the good\r\neffects mentioned above.\r\n\r\nIt may perhaps be observed that the Negociation is already finished\r\nwith England, and perhaps in a manner which will not be approved of by\r\nFrance. That may be, (though the terms of this arrangement may not be\r\nknown); but as to Spain, the negociation is still pending, and it is\r\nevident that if France makes the above _Declaration_ as to this Power\r\n(which declaration would be a demonstrative proof of what she would\r\nhave done in the other case if circumstances had required it), she would\r\nreceive the same credit as if the Declaration had been made relatively\r\nto the two Powers. In fact the Decree or resolution (and perhaps this\r\nlast would be preferable) can be worded in terms which would declare\r\nthat in case the arrangement with England were not satisfactory, France\r\nwill nevertheless, maintain the just demands of America against\r\nthat Power. A like Declaration, in case Mr. Jay should do anything\r\nreprehensible, and which might even be approved of in America, would\r\ncertainly raise the reputation of the French Republic to the most\r\neminent degree of splendour, and lower in proportion that of her\r\nenemies.\r\n\r\nIt is very certain that France cannot better favour the views of the\r\nBritish party in America, and wound in a most sensible manner the\r\nRepublican Government of this country, than by adopting a strict and\r\noppressive policy with regard to us. Every one knows that the injustices\r\ncommitted by the privateers and other ships belonging to the French\r\nRepublic against our navigation, were causes of exultation and joy\r\nto this party, even when their own properties were subjected to these\r\ndepredations, whilst the friends of France and the Revolution were vexed\r\nand most confused about it. It follows then, that a generous policy\r\nwould produce quite opposite effects--it would acquire for France the\r\nmerit that is her due; it would discourage the hopes of her adversaries,\r\nand furnish the friends of humanity and liberty with the means of acting\r\nagainst the intrigues of England, and cement the Union, and contribute\r\ntowards the true interests of the two republics.\r\n\r\nSo sublime and generous a manner of acting, which would not cost\r\nanything to France, would cement in a stronger way the ties between\r\nthe two republics. The effect of such an event, would confound and\r\nannihilate in an irrevocable manner all the partisans for the British\r\nin America. There are nineteen twentieths of our nation attached through\r\ninclination and gratitude to France, and the small number who seek\r\nuselessly all sorts of pretexts to magnify the small occasions of\r\ncomplaint which might have subsisted previously will find itself reduced\r\nto silence, or have to join their expressions of gratitude to ours.--The\r\nresults of this event cannot be doubted, though not reckoned on: all the\r\nAmerican hearts will be French, and England will be afflicted.\r\n\r\nAn American.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIV. DISSERTATION ON FIRST PRINCIPLES OF GOVERNMENT. (1)\r\n\r\n     1 Printed from the first edition, whose title is as above,\r\n     with the addition: \"By Thomas Paine, Author of Common Sense;\r\n     Rights of Man; Age of Reason. Paris, Printed at the\r\n     English Press, me de Vaugerard, No. 970. Third year of the\r\n     French Republic.\" The pamphlet seems to have appeared early\r\n     in July (perhaps the Fourth), 1795, and was meant to\r\n     influence the decision of the National Convention on the\r\n     Constitution then under discussion. This Constitution,\r\n     adopted September 23d, presently swept away by Napoleon,\r\n     contained some features which appeared to Paine reactionary.\r\n     Those to which he most objected are quoted by him in his\r\n     speech in the Convention, which is bound up in the same\r\n     pamphlet, and follows this \"Dissertation\" in the present\r\n     volume. In the Constitution as adopted Paine's preference\r\n     for a plural Executive was established, and though the\r\n     bicameral organization (the Council of Five Hundred and the\r\n     Council of Ancients) was not such as he desired, his chief\r\n     objection was based on his principle of manhood suffrage.\r\n     But in regard to this see Paine's \"Dissertations on\r\n     Government,\" written nine years before (vol. ii., ch. vi. of\r\n     this work), and especially p. 138 seq. of that volume, where\r\n     he indicates the method of restraining the despotism of\r\n     numbers.--_Editor._,\r\n\r\nThere is no subject more interesting to every man than the subject of\r\ngovernment. His security, be he rich or poor, and in a great measure\r\nhis prosperity, are connected therewith; it is therefore his interest\r\nas well as his duty to make himself acquainted with its principles, and\r\nwhat the practice ought to be.\r\n\r\nEvery art and science, however imperfectly known at first, has been\r\nstudied, improved, and brought to what we call perfection by the\r\nprogressive labours of succeeding generations; but the science of\r\ngovernment has stood still. No improvement has been made in the\r\nprinciple and scarcely any in the practice till the American revolution\r\nbegan. In all the countries of Europe (except in France) the same forms\r\nand systems that were erected in the remote ages of ignorance still\r\ncontinue, and their antiquity is put in the place of principle; it is\r\nforbidden to investigate their origin, or by what right they exist.\r\nIf it be asked how has this happened, the answer is easy: they are\r\nestablished on a principle that is false, and they employ their power to\r\nprevent detection.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the mystery with which the science of government has\r\nbeen enveloped, for the purpose of enslaving, plundering, and imposing\r\nupon mankind, it is of all things the least mysterious and the most easy\r\nto be understood. The meanest capacity cannot be at a loss, if it begins\r\nits enquiries at the right point. Every art and science has some point,\r\nor alphabet, at which the study of that art or science begins, and by\r\nthe assistance of which the progress is facilitated. The same method\r\nought to be observed with respect to the science of government.\r\n\r\nInstead then of embarrassing the subject in the outset with the numerous\r\nsubdivisions under which different forms of government have been\r\nclassed, such as aristocracy, democracy, oligarchy, monarchy, &c.\r\nthe better method will be to begin with what may be called primary\r\ndivisions, or those under which all the several subdivisions will be\r\ncomprehended.\r\n\r\nThe primary divisions are but two:\r\n\r\nFirst, government by election and representation.\r\n\r\nSecondly, government by hereditary succession.\r\n\r\nAll the several forms and systems of government, however numerous\r\nor diversified, class themselves under one or other of those primary\r\ndivisions; for either they are on the system of representation, or on\r\nthat of hereditary succession. As to that equivocal thing called mixed\r\ngovernment, such as the late government of Holland, and the present\r\ngovernment of England, it does not make an exception to the general\r\nrule, because the parts separately considered are either representative\r\nor hereditary.\r\n\r\nBeginning then our enquiries at this point, we have first to examine\r\ninto the nature of those two primary divisions.\r\n\r\nIf they are equally right in principle, it is mere matter of opinion\r\nwhich we prefer. If the one be demonstratively better than the other,\r\nthat difference directs our choice; but if one of them should be so\r\nabsolutely false as not to have a right to existence, the matter settles\r\nitself at once; because a negative proved on one thing, where two only\r\nare offered, and one must be accepted, amounts to an affirmative on the\r\nother.\r\n\r\nThe revolutions that are now spreading themselves in the world have\r\ntheir origin in this state of the case, and the present war is a\r\nconflict between the representative system founded on the rights of the\r\npeople, and the hereditary system founded in usurpation. As to what are\r\ncalled Monarchy, Royalty, and Aristocracy, they do not, either as things\r\nor as terms, sufficiently describe the hereditary system; they are but\r\nsecondary things or signs of the hereditary system, and which fall of\r\nthemselves if that system has not a right to exist. Were there no\r\nsuch terms as Monarchy, Royalty, and Aristocracy, or were other terms\r\nsubstituted in their place, the hereditary system, if it continued,\r\nwould not be altered thereby. It would be the same system under any\r\nother titulary name as it is now.\r\n\r\nThe character therefore of the revolutions of the present day\r\ndistinguishes itself most definitively by grounding itself on the system\r\nof representative government, in opposition to the hereditary. No other\r\ndistinction reaches the whole of the principle.\r\n\r\nHaving thus opened the case generally, I proceed, in the first place, to\r\nexamine the hereditary system, because it has the priority in point of\r\ntime. The representative system is the invention of the modern world;\r\nand, that no doubt may arise as to my own opinion, I declare it\r\nbefore hand, which is, _that there is not a problem in Euclid more\r\nmathematically true, than that hereditary government has not a right to\r\nexist. When therefore we take from any man the exercise of hereditary\r\npower, we take away that which he never had the right to possess, and\r\nwhich no law or custom could, or ever can, give him a title to_.\r\n\r\nThe arguments that have hitherto been employed against the hereditary\r\nsystem have been chiefly founded upon the absurdity of it, and its\r\nincompetency to the purpose of good government. Nothing can present to\r\nour judgment, or to our imagination, a figure of greater absurdity, than\r\nthat of seeing the government of a nation fall, as it frequently does,\r\ninto the hands of a lad necessarily destitute of experience, and often\r\nlittle better than a fool. It is an insult to every man of years, of\r\ncharacter, and of talents, in a country. The moment we begin to reason\r\nupon the hereditary system, it falls into derision; let but a single\r\nidea begin, and a thousand will soon follow. Insignificance, imbecility,\r\nchildhood, dotage, want of moral character; in fine, every defect\r\nserious or laughable unite to hold up the hereditary system as a figure\r\nof ridicule. Leaving, however, the ridiculousness of the thing to the\r\nreflections of the reader, I proceed to the more important part of the\r\nquestion, namely, whether such a system has a right to exist.\r\n\r\nTo be satisfied of the right of a thing to exist, we must be satisfied\r\nthat it had a right to begin. If it had not a right to begin, it has not\r\na right to continue. By what right then did the hereditary system begin?\r\nLet a man but ask himself this question, and he will find that he cannot\r\nsatisfy himself with an answer.\r\n\r\nThe right which any man or any family had to set itself up at first to\r\ngovern a nation, and to establish itself hereditarily, was no other than\r\nthe right which Robespierre had to do the same thing in France. If he\r\nhad none, they had none. If they had any, he had as much; for it is\r\nimpossible to discover superiority of right in any family, by virtue of\r\nwhich hereditary government could begin. The Capets, the Guelphs,\r\nthe Robespierres, the Marats, are all on the same standing as to the\r\nquestion of right. It belongs exclusively to none.\r\n\r\nIt is one step towards liberty, to perceive that hereditary government\r\ncould not begin as an exclusive right in any family. The next point\r\nwill be, whether, having once begun, it could grow into a right by the\r\ninfluence of time.\r\n\r\nThis would be supposing an absurdity; for either it is putting time in\r\nthe place of principle, or making it superior to principle; whereas time\r\nhas no more connection with, or influence upon principle, than principle\r\nhas upon time. The wrong which began a thousand years ago, is as much a\r\nwrong as if it began to-day; and the right which originates to-day, is\r\nas much a right as if it had the sanction of a thousand years. Time with\r\nrespect to principles is an eternal now: it has no operation upon them:\r\nit changes nothing of their nature and qualities. But what have we to\r\ndo with a thousand years? Our life-time is but a short portion of that\r\nperiod, and if we find the wrong in existence as soon as we begin to\r\nlive, that is the point of time at which it begins to us; and our right\r\nto resist it is the same as if it never existed before.\r\n\r\nAs hereditary government could not begin as a natural right in any\r\nfamily, nor derive after its commencement any right from time, we have\r\nonly to examine whether there exist in a nation a right to set it up,\r\nand establish it by what is called law, as has been done in England. I\r\nanswer NO; and that any law or any constitution made for that purpose is\r\nan act of treason against the right of every minor in the nation, at the\r\ntime it is made, and against the rights of all succeeding generations.\r\nI shall speak upon each of those cases. First, of the minor at the time\r\nsuch law is made. Secondly, of the generations that are to follow.\r\n\r\nA nation, in a collective sense, comprehends all the individuals of\r\nwhatever age, from just born to just dying. Of these, one part will be\r\nminors, and the other aged. The average of life is not exactly the same\r\nin every climate and country, but in general, the minority in years are\r\nthe majority in numbers; that is, the number of persons under twenty-one\r\nyears, is greater than the number of persons above that age. This\r\ndifference in number is not necessary to the establishment of the\r\nprinciple I mean to lay down, but it serves to shew the justice of it\r\nmore strongly. The principle would be equally as good, if the majority\r\nin years were also the majority in numbers.\r\n\r\nThe rights of minors are as sacred as the rights of the aged. The\r\ndifference is altogether in the different age of the two parties, and\r\nnothing in the nature of the rights; the rights are the same rights;\r\nand are to be preserved inviolate for the inheritance of the minors when\r\nthey shall come of age. During the minority of minors their rights are\r\nunder the sacred guardianship of the aged. The minor cannot surrender\r\nthem; the guardian cannot dispossess him; consequently, the aged part\r\nof a nation, who are the law-makers for the time being, and who, in the\r\nmarch of life are but a few years ahead of those who are yet minors, and\r\nto whom they must shortly give place, have not and cannot have the right\r\nto make a law to set up and establish hereditary government, or, to\r\nspeak more distinctly, _an hereditary succession of governors_; because\r\nit is an attempt to deprive every minor in the nation, at the time such\r\na law is made, of his inheritance of rights when he shall come of age,\r\nand to subjugate him to a system of government to which, during his\r\nminority, he could neither consent nor object.\r\n\r\nIf a person who is a minor at the time such a law is proposed, had\r\nhappened to have been born a few years sooner, so as to be of the age of\r\ntwenty-one years at the time of proposing it, his right to have objected\r\nagainst it, to have exposed the injustice and tyrannical principles of\r\nit, and to have voted against it, will be admitted on all sides. If,\r\ntherefore, the law operates to prevent his exercising the same rights\r\nafter he comes of age as he would have had a right to exercise had he\r\nbeen of age at the time, it is undeniably a law to take away and annul\r\nthe rights of every person in the nation who shall be a minor at the\r\ntime of making such a law, and consequently the right to make it cannot\r\nexist.\r\n\r\nI come now to speak of government by hereditary succession, as it\r\napplies to succeeding generations; and to shew that in this case, as in\r\nthe case of minors, there does not exist in a nation a right to set it\r\nup.\r\n\r\nA nation, though continually existing, is continually in a state of\r\nrenewal and succession. It is never stationary.\r\n\r\nEvery day produces new births, carries minors forward to maturity, and\r\nold persons from the stage. In this ever running flood of generations\r\nthere is no part superior in authority to another. Could we conceive an\r\nidea of superiority in any, at what point of time, or in what century of\r\nthe world, are we to fix it? To what cause are we to ascribe it? By\r\nwhat evidence are we to prove it? By what criterion are we to know it? A\r\nsingle reflection will teach us that our ancestors, like ourselves, were\r\nbut tenants for life in the great freehold of rights. The fee-absolute\r\nwas not in them, it is not in us, it belongs to the whole family of\r\nman, thro* all ages. If we think otherwise than this, we think either as\r\nslaves or as tyrants. As slaves, if we think that any former generation\r\nhad a right to bind us; as tyrants, if we think that we have authority\r\nto bind the generations that are to follow.\r\n\r\nIt may not be inapplicable to the subject, to endeavour to define what\r\nis to be understood by a generation, in the sense the word is here used.\r\n\r\nAs a natural term its meaning is sufficiently clear. The father, the\r\nson, the grandson, are so many distinct generations. But when we speak\r\nof a generation as describing the persons in whom legal authority\r\nresides, as distinct from another generation of the same description who\r\nare to succeed them, it comprehends all those who are above the age of\r\ntwenty-one years, at the time that we count from; and a generation of\r\nthis kind will continue in authority between fourteen and twenty-one\r\nyears, that is, until the number of minors, who shall have arrived at\r\nage, shall be greater than the number of persons remaining of the former\r\nstock.\r\n\r\nFor example: if France, at this or any other moment, contains\r\ntwenty-four millions of souls, twelve millions will be males, and twelve\r\nfemales. Of the twelve millions of males, six millions will be of the\r\nage of twenty-one years, and six will be under, and the authority\r\nto govern will reside in the first six. But every day will make some\r\nalteration, and in twenty-one years every one of those minors who\r\nsurvives will have arrived at age, and the greater part of the former\r\nstock will be gone: the majority of persons then living, in whom the\r\nlegal authority resides, will be composed of those who, twenty-one years\r\nbefore, had no legal existence. Those will be fathers and grandfathers\r\nin their turn, and, in the next twenty-one years, (or less) another race\r\nof minors, arrived at age, will succeed them, and so on.\r\n\r\nAs this is ever the case, and as every generation is equal in rights to\r\nanother, it consequently follows, that there cannot be a right in any\r\nto establish government by hereditary succession, because it would be\r\nsupposing itself possessed of a right superior to the rest, namely,\r\nthat of commanding by its own authority how the world shall be hereafter\r\ngoverned and who shall govern it. Every age and generation is, and must\r\nbe, (as a matter of right,) as free to act for itself in all cases, as\r\nthe age and generation that preceded it. The vanity and presumption of\r\ngoverning beyond the grave is the most ridiculous and insolent of all\r\ntyrannies. Man has no property in man, neither has one generation a\r\nproperty in the generations that are to follow.\r\n\r\nIn the first part of the Rights of Man I have spoken of government by\r\nhereditary succession; and I will here close the subject with an extract\r\nfrom that work, which states it under the two following heads. (1)\r\n\r\n     1 The quotation, here omitted, will be found in vol. ii. of\r\n     this work, beginning with p. 364, and continuing, with a few\r\n     omissions, to the 15th line of p. 366. This \"Dissertation\"\r\n     was originally written for circulation in Holland, where\r\n     Paine's \"Rights of Man\" was not well known.--_Editor._\r\n\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n\r\nThe history of the English parliament furnishes an example of this kind;\r\nand which merits to be recorded, as being the greatest instance of\r\nlegislative ignorance and want of principle that is to be found in any\r\ncountry. The case is as follows:\r\n\r\nThe English parliament of 1688, imported a man and his wife from\r\nHolland, _William and Mary_, and made them king and queen of England.\r\n(2) Having done this, the said parliament made a law to convey the\r\ngovernment of the country to the heirs of William and Mary, in the\r\nfollowing words: \"We, the lords spiritual and temporal, and commons, do,\r\nin the name of the people of England, most humbly and faithfully submit\r\n_ourselves, our heirs, and posterities_, to William and Mary, _their\r\nheirs and posterities_, for ever.\" And in a subsequent law, as quoted by\r\nEdmund Burke, the said parliament, in the name of the people of England\r\nthen living, _binds the said people, their heirs and posterities, to\r\nWilliam and Mary, their heirs and posterities, to the end of time_.\r\n\r\n     2 \"The Bill of Rights (temp. William III.) shows that the\r\n     Lords and Commons met not in Parliament but in convention,\r\n     that they declared against James II., and in favour of\r\n     William III.  The latter was accepted as sovereign, and, when\r\n     monarch. Acta of Parliament were passed confirming what had\r\n     been done.\"--Joseph Fisher in Notes and Queries (London),\r\n     May 2,1874. This does not affect Paine's argument, as a\r\n     Convention could have no more right to bind the future than\r\n     a Parliament.--_Editor._.\r\n\r\nIt is not sufficient that we laugh at the ignorance of such law-makers;\r\nit is necessary that we reprobate their want of principle. The\r\nconstituent assembly of France, 1789, fell into the same vice as the\r\nparliament of England had done, and assumed to establish an hereditary\r\nsuccession in the family of the Capets, as an act of the constitution\r\nof that year. That every nation, _for the time being_, has a right to\r\ngovern itself as it pleases, must always be admitted; but government by\r\nhereditary succession is government for another race of people, and\r\nnot for itself; and as those on whom it is to operate are not yet in\r\nexistence, or are minors, so neither is the right in existence to set it\r\nup for them, and to assume such a right is treason against the right of\r\nposterity.\r\n\r\nI here close the arguments on the first head, that of government by\r\nhereditary succession; and proceed to the second, that of government\r\nby election and representation; or, as it may be concisely expressed,\r\n_representative government_, in contra-distinction to _hereditary\r\ngovernment_.\r\n\r\nReasoning by exclusion, if _hereditary government_ has not a right to\r\nexist, and that it has not is proveable, _representative government_ is\r\nadmitted of course.\r\n\r\nIn contemplating government by election and representation, we amuse\r\nnot ourselves in enquiring when or how, or by what right, it began. Its\r\norigin is ever in view. Man is himself the origin and the evidence\r\nof the right. It appertains to him in right of his existence, and his\r\nperson is the title deed.(1)\r\n\r\nThe true and only true basis of representative government is equality of\r\nRights. Every man has a right to one vote, and no more, in the choice\r\nof representatives. The rich have no more right to exclude the poor from\r\nthe right of voting, or of electing and being elected, than the poor\r\nhave to exclude the rich; and wherever it is attempted, or proposed, on\r\neither side, it is a question of force and not of right. Who is he that\r\nwould exclude another? That other has a right to exclude him.\r\n\r\nThat which is now called aristocracy implies an inequality of rights;\r\nbut who are the persons that have a right to establish this inequality?\r\nWill the rich exclude themselves? No. Will the poor exclude themselves?\r\nNo. By what right then can any be excluded? It would be a question, if\r\nany man or class of men have a right to exclude themselves; but, be this\r\nas it may, they cannot have the right to exclude another. The poor will\r\nnot delegate such a right to the rich, nor the rich to the poor, and to\r\nassume it is not only to assume arbitrary power, but to assume a right\r\nto commit robbery. Personal rights, of which the right of voting for\r\nrepresentatives is one, are a species of property of the most sacred\r\nkind: and he that would employ his pecuniary property, or presume upon\r\nthe influence it gives him, to dispossess or rob another of his property\r\nof rights, uses that pecuniary property as he would use fire-arms, and\r\nmerits to have it taken from him.\r\n\r\n     1 \"The sacred rights of mankind are not to be rummaged for\r\n     among old parchments or musty records. They are written as\r\n     with a sunbeam in the whole volume of human nature by the\r\n     hand of Divinity itself, and can never be erased or obscured\r\n     by mortal power.\"--Alexander Hamilton, 1775. (Cf. Rights of\r\n     Man, Toi. ii., p. 304): \"Portions of antiquity by proving\r\n     everything establish nothing. It is authority against\r\n     authority all the way, till we come to the divine origin of\r\n     the rights of man at the creation.\"--_Editor._.\r\n\r\nInequality of rights is created by a combination in one part of the\r\ncommunity to exclude another part from its rights. Whenever it be made\r\nan article of a constitution, or a law, that the right of voting, or\r\nof electing and being elected, shall appertain exclusively to persons\r\npossessing a certain quantity of property, be it little or much, it is a\r\ncombination of the persons possessing that quantity to exclude those who\r\ndo not possess the same quantity. It is investing themselves with powers\r\nas a self-created part of society, to the exclusion of the rest.\r\n\r\nIt is always to be taken for granted, that those who oppose an equality\r\nof rights never mean the exclusion should take place on themselves; and\r\nin this view of the case, pardoning the vanity of the thing, aristocracy\r\nis a subject of laughter. This self-soothing vanity is encouraged by\r\nanother idea not less selfish, which is, that the opposers conceive they\r\nare playing a safe game, in which there is a chance to gain and none\r\nto lose; that at any rate the doctrine of equality includes _them_,\r\nand that if they cannot get more rights than those whom they oppose and\r\nwould exclude, they shall not have less. This opinion has already been\r\nfatal to thousands, who, not contented with _equal rights_, have sought\r\nmore till they lost all, and experienced in themselves the degrading\r\n_inequality_ they endeavoured to fix upon others.\r\n\r\nIn any view of the case it is dangerous and impolitic, sometimes\r\nridiculous, and always unjust, to make property the criterion of the\r\nright of voting. If the sum or value of the property upon which the\r\nright is to take place be considerable, it will exclude a majority of\r\nthe people, and unite them in a common interest against the government\r\nand against those who support it; and as the power is always with\r\nthe majority, they can overturn such a government and its supporters\r\nwhenever they please.\r\n\r\nIf, in order to avoid this danger, a small quantity of property be\r\nfixed, as the criterion of the right, it exhibits liberty in disgrace,\r\nby putting it in competition with accident and insignificance. When a\r\nbrood-mare shall fortunately produce a foal or a mule that, by being\r\nworth the sum in question, shall convey to its owner the right of\r\nvoting, or by its death take it from him, in whom does the origin of\r\nsuch a right exist? Is it in the man, or in the mule? When we consider\r\nhow many ways property may be acquired without merit, and lost without a\r\ncrime, we ought to spurn the idea of making it a criterion of rights.\r\n\r\nBut the offensive part of the case is, that this exclusion from the\r\nright of voting implies a stigma on the moral char* acter of the persons\r\nexcluded; and this is what no part of the community has a right to\r\npronounce upon another part. No external circumstance can justify it:\r\nwealth is no proof of moral character; nor poverty of the want of it.\r\nOn the contrary, wealth is often the presumptive evidence of dishonesty;\r\nand poverty the negative evidence of innocence. If therefore property,\r\nwhether little or much, be made a criterion, the means by which that\r\nproperty has been acquired ought to be made a criterion also.\r\n\r\nThe only ground upon which exclusion from the right of voting is\r\nconsistent with justice, would be to inflict it as a punishment for a\r\ncertain time upon those who should propose to take away that right from\r\nothers. The right of voting for representatives is the primary right by\r\nwhich other rights are protected. To take away this right is to reduce\r\na man to slavery, for slavery consists in being subject to the will of\r\nanother, and he that has not a vote in the election of representatives\r\nis in this case. The proposal therefore to disfranchise any class of men\r\nis as criminal as the proposal to take away property. When we speak\r\nof right, we ought always to unite with it the idea of duties: rights\r\nbecome duties by reciprocity. The right which I enjoy becomes my duty\r\nto guarantee it to another, and he to me; and those who violate the duty\r\njustly incur a forfeiture of the right.\r\n\r\nIn a political view of the case, the strength and permanent security\r\nof government is in proportion to the number of people interested in\r\nsupporting it. The true policy therefore is to interest the whole by\r\nan equality of rights, for the danger arises from exclusions. It is\r\npossible to exclude men from the right of voting, but it is impossible\r\nto exclude them from the right of rebelling against that exclusion; and\r\nwhen all other rights are taken away, the right of rebellion is made\r\nperfect.\r\n\r\nWhile men could be persuaded they had no rights, or that rights\r\nappertained only to a certain class of men, or that government was a\r\nthing existing in right of itself, it was not difficult to govern\r\nthem authoritatively. The ignorance in which they were held, and the\r\nsuperstition in which they were instructed, furnished the means of doing\r\nit. But when the ignorance is gone, and the superstition with it; when\r\nthey perceive the imposition that has been acted upon them; when they\r\nreflect that the cultivator and the manufacturer are the primary\r\nmeans of all the wealth that exists in the world, beyond what nature\r\nspontaneously produces; when they begin to feel their consequence by\r\ntheir usefulness, and their right as members of society, it is then no\r\nlonger possible to govern them as before. The fraud once detected\r\ncannot be re-acted. To attempt it is to provoke derision, or invite\r\ndestruction.\r\n\r\nThat property will ever be unequal is certain. Industry, superiority\r\nof talents, dexterity of management, extreme frugality, fortunate\r\nopportunities, or the opposite, or the means of those things, will ever\r\nproduce that effect, without having recourse to the harsh, ill sounding\r\nnames of avarice and oppression; and besides this, there are some men\r\nwho, though they do not despise wealth, will not stoop to the drudgery\r\nor the means of acquiring it, nor will be troubled with it beyond their\r\nwants or their independence; whilst in others there is an avidity to\r\nobtain it by every means not punishable; it makes the sole business of\r\ntheir lives, and they follow it as a religion. All that is required\r\nwith respect to property is to obtain it honestly, and not employ it\r\ncriminally; but it is always criminally employed when it is made a\r\ncriterion for exclusive rights.\r\n\r\nIn institutions that are purely pecuniary, such as that of a bank or a\r\ncommercial company, the rights of the members composing that company are\r\nwholly created by the property they invest therein; and no other rights\r\nare represented in the government of that company, than what arise out\r\nof that property; neither has that government cognizance of _any thing\r\nbut property_.\r\n\r\nBut the case is totally different with respect to the institution of\r\ncivil government, organized on the system of representation. Such a\r\ngovernment has cognizance of every thing, and of _every man_ as a member\r\nof the national society, whether he has property or not; and, therefore,\r\nthe principle requires that _every man_, and _every kind of right_, be\r\nrepresented, of which the right to acquire and to hold property is but\r\none, and that not of the most essential kind. The protection of a man's\r\nperson is more sacred than the protection of property; and besides\r\nthis, the faculty of performing any kind of work or services by which\r\nhe acquires a livelihood, or maintaining his family, is of the nature of\r\nproperty. It is property to him; he has acquired it; and it is as much\r\nthe object of his protection as exterior property, possessed without\r\nthat faculty, can be the object of protection in another person.\r\n\r\nI have always believed that the best security for property, be it much\r\nor little, is to remove from every part of the community, as far as\r\ncan possibly be done, every cause of complaint, and every motive to\r\nviolence; and this can only be done by an equality of rights. When\r\nrights are secure, property is secure in consequence. But when property\r\nis made a pretence for unequal or exclusive rights, it weakens the right\r\nto hold the property, and provokes indignation and tumult; for it is\r\nunnatural to believe that property can be secure under the guarantee of\r\na society injured in its rights by the influence of that property.\r\n\r\nNext to the injustice and ill-policy of making property a pretence\r\nfor exclusive rights, is the unaccountable absurdity of giving to mere\r\n_sound_ the idea of property, and annexing to it certain rights; for\r\nwhat else is a _title_ but sound? Nature is often giving to the world\r\nsome extraordinary men who arrive at fame by merit and universal\r\nconsent, such as Aristotle, Socrates, Plato, &c. They were truly great\r\nor noble.\r\n\r\nBut when government sets up a manufactory of nobles, it is as absurd\r\nas if she undertook to manufacture wise men. Her nobles are all\r\ncounterfeits.\r\n\r\nThis wax-work order has assumed the name of aristocracy; and the\r\ndisgrace of it would be lessened if it could be considered only as\r\nchildish imbecility. We pardon foppery because of its insignificance»\r\nand on the same ground we might pardon the foppery of Titles. But the\r\norigin of aristocracy was worse than foppery. It was robbery. The\r\nfirst aristocrats in all countries were brigands. Those of later times,\r\nsycophants.\r\n\r\nIt is very well known that in England, (and the same will be found\r\nin other countries) the great landed estates now held in descent were\r\nplundered from the quiet inhabitants at the conquest. The possibility\r\ndid not exist of acquiring such estates honestly. If it be asked how\r\nthey could have been acquired, no answer but that of robbery can\r\nbe given. That they were not acquired by trade, by commerce, by\r\nmanufactures, by agriculture, or by any reputable employment, is\r\ncertain. How then were they acquired? Blush, aristocracy, to hear your\r\norigin, for your progenitors were Thieves. They were the Robespierres\r\nand the Jacobins of that day. When they had committed the robbery, they\r\nendeavoured to lose the disgrace of it by sinking their real names under\r\nfictitious ones, which they called Titles. It is ever the practice of\r\nFelons to act in this manner. They never pass by their real names.(1)\r\n\r\n     1 This and the preceding paragraph have been omitted from\r\n     some editions.--Editor.\r\n\r\nAs property, honestly obtained, is best secured by an equality of\r\nRights, so ill-gotten property depends for protection on a monopoly of\r\nrights. He who has robbed another of his property, will next endeavour\r\nto disarm him of his rights, to secure that property; for when the\r\nrobber becomes the legislator he believes himself secure. That part\r\nof the government of England that is called the house of lords, was\r\noriginally composed of persons who had committed the robberies of which\r\nI have been speaking. It was an association for the protection of the\r\nproperty they had stolen.\r\n\r\nBut besides the criminality of the origin of aristocracy, it has an\r\ninjurious effect on the moral and physical character of man. Like\r\nslavery it debilitates the human faculties; for as the mind bowed down\r\nby slavery loses in silence its elastic powers, so, in the contrary\r\nextreme, when it is buoyed up by folly, it becomes incapable of exerting\r\nthem, and dwindles into imbecility. It is impossible that a mind\r\nemployed upon ribbands and titles can ever be great. The childishness of\r\nthe objects consumes the man.\r\n\r\nIt is at all times necessary, and more particularly so during the\r\nprogress of a revolution, and until right ideas confirm themselves by\r\nhabit, that we frequently refresh our patriotism by reference to first\r\nprinciples. It is by tracing things to their origin that we learn to\r\nunderstand them: and it is by keeping that line and that origin always\r\nin view that we never forget them.\r\n\r\nAn enquiry into the origin of Rights will demonstrate to us that\r\n_rights_ are not _gifts_ from one man to another, nor from one class of\r\nmen to another; for who is he who could be the first giver, or by what\r\nprinciple, or on what authority, could he possess the right of giving? A\r\ndeclaration of rights is not a creation of them, nor a donation of them.\r\nIt is a manifest of the principle by which they exist, followed by a\r\ndetail of what the rights are; for every civil right has a natural\r\nright for its foundation, and it includes the principle of a reciprocal\r\nguarantee of those rights from man to man. As, therefore, it is\r\nimpossible to discover any origin of rights otherwise than in the origin\r\nof man, it consequently follows, that rights appertain to man in right\r\nof his existence only, and must therefore be equal to every man. The\r\nprinciple of an _equality of rights_ is clear and simple. Every man can\r\nunderstand it, and it is by understanding his rights that he learns his\r\nduties; for where the rights of men are equal, every man must finally\r\nsee the necessity of protecting the rights of others as the most\r\neffectual security for his own. But if, in the formation of a\r\nconstitution, we depart from the principle of equal rights, or attempt\r\nany modification of it, we plunge into a labyrinth of difficulties from\r\nwhich there is no way out but by retreating. Where are we to stop? Or\r\nby what principle are we to find out the point to stop at, that shall\r\ndiscriminate between men of the same country, part of whom shall be\r\nfree, and the rest not? If property is to be made the criterion, it is\r\na total departure from every moral principle of liberty, because it\r\nis attaching rights to mere matter, and making man the agent of that\r\nmatter. It is, moreover, holding up property as an apple of discord,\r\nand not only exciting but justifying war against it; for I maintain the\r\nprinciple, that when property is used as an instrument to take away the\r\nrights of those who may happen not to possess property, it is used to an\r\nunlawful purpose, as fire-arms would be in a similar case.\r\n\r\nIn a state of nature all men are equal in rights, but they are not equal\r\nin power; the weak cannot protect themselves against the strong. This\r\nbeing the case, the institution of civil society is for the purpose\r\nof making an equalization of powers that shall be parallel to, and\r\na guarantee of, the equality of rights. The laws of a country, when\r\nproperly constructed, apply to this purpose. Every man takes the arm of\r\nthe law for his protection as more effectual than his own; and therefore\r\nevery man has an equal right in the formation of the government, and\r\nof the laws by which he is to be governed and judged. In extensive\r\ncountries and societies, such as America and France, this right in the\r\nindividual can only be exercised by delegation, that is, by election and\r\nrepresentation; and hence it is that the institution of representative\r\ngovernment arises.\r\n\r\nHitherto, I have confined myself to matters of principle only. First,\r\nthat hereditary government has not a right to exist; that it cannot be\r\nestablished on any principle of right; and that it is a violation of all\r\nprinciple. Secondly, that government by election and representation has\r\nits origin in the natural and eternal rights of man; for whether a man\r\nbe his own lawgiver, as he would be in a state of nature; or whether he\r\nexercises his portion of legislative sovereignty in his own person, as\r\nmight be the case in small democracies where all could assemble for the\r\nformation of the laws by which they were to be governed; or whether he\r\nexercises it in the choice of persons to represent him in a national\r\nassembly of representatives, the origin of the right is the same in\r\nall cases. The first, as is before observed, is defective in power; the\r\nsecond, is practicable only in democracies of small extent; the third,\r\nis the greatest scale upon which human government can be instituted.\r\n\r\nNext to matters of _principle_ are matters of _opinion_, and it is\r\nnecessary to distinguish between the two. Whether the rights of men\r\nshall be equal is not a matter of opinion but of right, and consequently\r\nof principle; for men do not hold their rights as grants from each\r\nother, but each one in right of himself. Society is the guardian but not\r\nthe giver. And as in extensive societies, such as America and France,\r\nthe right of the individual in matters of government cannot be exercised\r\nbut by election and representation, it consequently follows that the\r\nonly system of government consistent with principle, where simple\r\ndemocracy is impracticable, is the representative system. But as to the\r\norganical part, or the manner in which the several parts of government\r\nshall be arranged and composed, it is altogether _matter of opinion_,\r\nIt is necessary that all the parts be conformable with the _principle of\r\nequal rights_; and so long as this principle be religiously adhered to,\r\nno very material error can take place, neither can any error continue\r\nlong in that part which falls within the province of opinion.\r\n\r\nIn all matters of opinion, the social compact, or the principle by which\r\nsociety is held together, requires that the majority of opinions becomes\r\nthe rule for the whole, and that the minority yields practical obedience\r\nthereto. This is perfectly conformable to the principle of equal rights:\r\nfor, in the first place, every man has a _right to give an opinion_ but\r\nno man has a right that his opinion should _govern the rest_. In the\r\nsecond place, it is not supposed to be known beforehand on which side\r\nof any question, whether for or against, any man's opinion will fall.\r\nHe may happen to be in a majority upon some questions, and in a minority\r\nupon others; and by the same rule that he expects obedience in the one\r\ncase, he must yield it in the other. All the disorders that have arisen\r\nin France, during the progress of the revolution, have had their origin,\r\nnot in the _principle of equal rights_, but in the violation of that\r\nprinciple. The principle of equal rights has been repeatedly violated,\r\nand that not by the majority but by the minority, and _that minority\r\nhas been composed of men possessing property as well as of men without\r\nproperty; property, therefore, even upon the experience already had,\r\nis no more a criterion of character than it is of rights_. It will\r\nsometimes happen that the minority are right, and the majority are\r\nwrong, but as soon as experience proves this to be the case, the\r\nminority will increase to a majority, and the error will reform itself\r\nby the tranquil operation of freedom of opinion and equality of rights.\r\nNothing, therefore, can justify an insurrection, neither can it ever be\r\nnecessary where rights are equal and opinions free.\r\n\r\nTaking then the principle of equal rights as the foundation of the\r\nrevolution, and consequently of the constitution, the organical part,\r\nor the manner in which the several parts of the government shall be\r\narranged in the constitution, will, as is already said, fall within the\r\nprovince of opinion.\r\n\r\nVarious methods will present themselves upon a question of this kind,\r\nand tho' experience is yet wanting to determine which is the best,\r\nit has, I think, sufficiently decided which is the worst. That is\r\nthe worst, which in its deliberations and decisions is subject to\r\nthe precipitancy and passion of an individual; and when the whole\r\nlegislature is crowded into one body it is an individual in mass. In all\r\ncases of deliberation it is necessary to have a corps of reserve, and it\r\nwould be better to divide the representation by lot into two parts, and\r\nlet them revise and correct each other, than that the whole should sit\r\ntogether, and debate at once.\r\n\r\nRepresentative government is not necessarily confined to any one\r\nparticular form. The principle is the same in all the forms under which\r\nit can be arranged. The equal rights of the people is the root from\r\nwhich the whole springs, and the branches may be arranged as present\r\nopinion or future experience shall best direct. As to that _hospital of\r\nincurables_ (as Chesterfield calls it), the British house of peers,\r\nit is an excrescence growing out of corruption; and there is no more\r\naffinity or resemblance between any of the branches of a legislative\r\nbody originating from the right of the people, and the aforesaid\r\nhouse of peers, than between a regular member of the human body and an\r\nulcerated wen.\r\n\r\nAs to that part of government that is called the _executive_, it is\r\nnecessary in the first place to fix a precise meaning to the word.\r\n\r\nThere are but two divisions into which power can be arranged. First,\r\nthat of willing or decreeing the laws; secondly, that of executing or\r\nputting them in practice. The former corresponds to the intellectual\r\nfaculties of the human mind, which reasons and determines what shall be\r\ndone; the second, to the mechanical powers of the human body, that puts\r\nthat determination into practice.(1) If the former decides, and the\r\nlatter does not perform, it is a state of imbecility; and if the latter\r\nacts without the predetermination of the former, it is a state\r\nof lunacy. The executive department therefore is official, and is\r\nsubordinate to the legislative, as the body is to the mind, in a\r\nstate of health; for it is impossible to conceive the idea of two\r\nsovereignties, a sovereignty to _will_, and a sovereignty to _act_.\r\nThe executive is not invested with the power of deliberating whether it\r\nshall act or not; it has no discretionary authority in the case; for it\r\ncan _act no other thing_ than what the laws decree, and it is _obliged_\r\nto act conformably thereto; and in this view of the case, the executive\r\nis made up of all the official departments that execute the laws, of\r\nwhich that which is called the judiciary is the chief.\r\n\r\n     1 Paine may have had in mind the five senses, with reference\r\n     to the proposed five members of the Directory.--_Editor._.\r\n\r\nBut mankind have conceived an idea that _some kind of authority_ is\r\nnecessary to _superintend_ the execution of the laws and to see\r\nthat they are faithfully performed; and it is by confounding this\r\nsuperintending authority with the official execution that we get\r\nembarrassed about the term _executive power_. All the parts in the\r\ngovernments of the United States of America that are called THE\r\nEXECUTIVE, are no other than authorities to superintend the execution of\r\nthe laws; and they are so far independent of the legislative, that they\r\nknow the legislative only thro' the laws, and cannot be controuled or\r\ndirected by it through any other medium.\r\n\r\nIn what manner this superintending authority shall be appointed, or\r\ncomposed, is a matter that falls within the province of opinion. Some\r\nmay prefer one method and some another; and in all cases, where opinion\r\nonly and not principle is concerned, the majority of opinions forms the\r\nrule for all. There are however some things deducible from reason, and\r\nevidenced by experience, that serve to guide our decision upon the case.\r\nThe one is, never to invest any individual with extraordinary power; for\r\nbesides his being tempted to misuse it, it will excite contention and\r\ncommotion in the nation for the office. Secondly, never to invest power\r\nlong in the hands of any number of individuals. The inconveniences that\r\nmay be supposed to accompany frequent changes are less to be feared than\r\nthe danger that arises from long continuance.\r\n\r\nI shall conclude this discourse with offering some observations on the\r\nmeans of _preserving liberty_; for it is not only necessary that we\r\nestablish it, but that we preserve it.\r\n\r\nIt is, in the first place, necessary that we distinguish between the\r\nmeans made use of to overthrow despotism, in order to prepare the way\r\nfor the establishment of liberty, and the means to be used after the\r\ndespotism is overthrown.\r\n\r\nThe means made use of in the first case are justified by necessity.\r\nThose means are, in general, insurrections; for whilst the established\r\ngovernment of despotism continues in any country it is scarcely possible\r\nthat any other means can be used. It is also certain that in the\r\ncommencement of a revolution, the revolutionary party permit to\r\nthemselves a _discretionary exercise of power_ regulated more by\r\ncircumstances than by principle, which, were the practice to continue,\r\nliberty would never be established, or if established would soon be\r\noverthrown. It is never to be expected in a revolution that every man is\r\nto change his opinion at the same moment. There never yet was any truth\r\nor any principle so irresistibly obvious, that all men believed it\r\nat once. Time and reason must co-operate with each other to the final\r\nestablishment of any principle; and therefore those who may happen to be\r\nfirst convinced have not a right to persecute others, on whom conviction\r\noperates more slowly. The moral principle of revolutions is to instruct,\r\nnot to destroy.\r\n\r\nHad a constitution been established two years ago, (as ought to have\r\nbeen done,) the violences that have since desolated France and injured\r\nthe character of the revolution, would, in my opinion, have been\r\nprevented.(1) The nation would then have had a bond of union, and every\r\nindividual would have known the line of conduct he was to follow. But,\r\ninstead of this, a revolutionary government, a thing without either\r\nprinciple or authority, was substituted in its place; virtue and crime\r\ndepended upon accident; and that which was patriotism one day, became\r\ntreason the next. All these things have followed from the want of a\r\nconstitution; for it is the nature and intention of a constitution to\r\n_prevent governing by party_, by establishing a common principle that\r\nshall limit and control the power and impulse of party, and that says to\r\nall parties, _thus far shalt thou go and no further_. But in the absence\r\nof a constitution, men look entirely to party; and instead of principle\r\ngoverning party, party governs principle.\r\n\r\n     1 The Constitution adopted August 10, 1793, was by the\r\n     determination of \"The Mountain,\" suspended during the war\r\n     against France. The revolutionary government was thus made\r\n     chronic--_Editor._\r\n\r\nAn avidity to punish is always dangerous to liberty. It leads men to\r\nstretch, to misinterpret, and to misapply even the best of laws. He\r\nthat would make his own liberty secure, must guard even his enemy from\r\noppression; for if he violates this duty, he establishes a precedent\r\nthat will reach to himself. Thomas Paine.\r\n\r\nParis, July, 1795.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXV. THE CONSTITUTION OF 1795.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPEECH IN THE FRENCH NATIONAL CONVENTION, JULY 7, 1795.\r\n\r\nOn the motion of Lanthenas, \"That permission be granted to Thomas\r\nPaine, to deliver his sentiments on the declaration of rights and the\r\nconstitution,\" Thomas Paine ascended the Tribune; and no opposition\r\nbeing made to the motion, one of the Secretaries, who stood by Mr.\r\nPaine, read his speech, of which the following is a literal translation:\r\n\r\nCitizens:\r\n\r\nThe effects of a malignant fever, with which I was afflicted during a\r\nrigorous confinement in the Luxembourg, have thus long prevented me from\r\nattending at my post in the bosom of the Convention, and the magnitude\r\nof the subject under discussion, and no other consideration on earth,\r\ncould induce me now to repair to my station.\r\n\r\nA recurrence to the vicissitudes I have experienced, and the critical\r\nsituations in which I have been placed in consequence of the French\r\nRevolution, will throw upon what I now propose to submit to the\r\nConvention the most unequivocal proofs of my integrity, and the\r\nrectitude of those principles which have uniformly influenced my\r\nconduct.\r\n\r\nIn England I was proscribed for having vindicated the French Revolution,\r\nand I have suffered a rigorous imprisonment in France for having pursued\r\na similar mode of conduct. During the reign of terrorism, I was a close\r\nprisoner for eight long months, and remained so above three months after\r\nthe era of the 10th Thermidor.(1) I ought, however, to state, that I\r\nwas not persecuted by the _people_ either of England or France. The\r\nproceedings in both countries were the effects of the despotism existing\r\nin their respective governments. But, even if my persecution had\r\noriginated in the people at large, my principles and conduct would still\r\nhave remained the same. Principles which are influenced and subject to\r\nthe controul of tyranny, have not their foundation in the heart.\r\n\r\n     1 By the French republican calendar this was nearly the\r\n     time. Paine's imprisonment lasted from December 28, 1793, to\r\n     November 4, 1794. He was by a unanimous vote recalled to the\r\n     Convention, Dec 7, 1794, but his first appearance there was\r\n     on July 7, 1795.--_Editor._,\r\n\r\nA few days ago, I transmitted to you by the ordinary mode of\r\ndistribution, a short Treatise, entitled \"Dissertation on the First\r\nPrinciples of Government.\" This little work I did intend to have\r\ndedicated to the people of Holland, who, about the time I began to write\r\nit, were determined to accomplish a Revolution in their Government,\r\nrather than to the people of France, who had long before effected that\r\nglorious object. But there are, in the Constitution which is about to\r\nbe ratified by the Convention certain articles, and in the report which\r\npreceded it certain points, so repugnant to reason, and incompatible\r\nwith the true principles of liberty, as to render this Treatise, drawn\r\nup for another purpose, applicable to the present occasion, and under\r\nthis impression I presumed to submit it to your consideration.\r\n\r\nIf there be faults in the Constitution, it were better to expunge them\r\nnow, than to abide the event of their mischievous tendency; for certain\r\nit is, that the plan of the Constitution which has been presented to you\r\nis not consistent with the grand object of the Revolution, nor congenial\r\nto the sentiments of the individuals who accomplished it.\r\n\r\nTo deprive half the people in a nation of their rights as citizens,\r\nis an easy matter in theory or on paper: but it is a most dangerous\r\nexperiment, and rarely practicable in the execution.\r\n\r\nI shall now proceed to the observations I have to offer on this\r\nimportant subject; and I pledge myself that they shall be neither\r\nnumerous nor diffusive.\r\n\r\nIn my apprehension, a constitution embraces two distinct parts or\r\nobjects, the _Principle_ and the _Practice_; and it is not only an\r\nessential but an indispensable provision that the practice should\r\nemanate from, and accord with, the principle. Now I maintain, that the\r\nreverse of this proposition is the case in the plan of the Constitution\r\nunder discussion. The first article, for instance, of the _political\r\nstate_ of citizens, (v. Title ii. of the Constitution,) says:\r\n\r\n\"Every man born and resident in France, who, being twenty-one years of\r\nage, has inscribed his name on the Civic Register of his Canton, and who\r\nhas lived afterwards one year on the territory of the Republic, and who\r\npays any direct contribution whatever, real or personal, is a French\r\ncitizen.\" (1)\r\n\r\n     1 The article as ultimately adopted substituted \"person\" for\r\n     \"man,\" and for \"has inscribed his name\" (a slight\r\n     educational test) inserted \"whose name is inscribed.\"--\r\n     _Editor._\r\n\r\nI might here ask, if those only who come under the above description are\r\nto be considered as citizens, what designation do you mean to give the\r\nrest of the people? I allude to that portion of the people on whom the\r\nprincipal part of the labour falls, and on whom the weight of indirect\r\ntaxation will in the event chiefly press. In the structure of the social\r\nfabric, this class of people are infinitely superior to that privileged\r\norder whose only qualification is their wealth or territorial\r\npossessions. For what is trade without merchants? What is land without\r\ncultivation? And what is the produce of the land without manufactures?\r\nBut to return to the subject.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, this article is incompatible with the three first\r\narticles of the Declaration of Rights, which precede the Constitutional\r\nAct.\r\n\r\nThe first article of the Declaration of Rights says:\r\n\r\n\"The end of society is the public good; and the institution of\r\ngovernment is to secure to every individual the enjoyment of his\r\nrights.\"\r\n\r\nBut the article of the Constitution to which I have just adverted\r\nproposes as the object of society, not the public good, or in other\r\nwords, the good of _all_, but a partial good; or the good only of a\r\n_few_; and the Constitution provides solely for the rights of this few,\r\nto the exclusion of the many.\r\n\r\nThe second article of the Declaration of Rights says:\r\n\r\n\"The Rights of Man in society are Liberty, Equality, Security of his\r\nperson and property.\"\r\n\r\nBut the article alluded to in the Constitution has a direct tendency to\r\nestablish the reverse of this position, inasmuch as the persons excluded\r\nby this _inequality_ can neither be said to possess liberty, nor\r\nsecurity against oppression. They are consigned totally to the caprice\r\nand tyranny of the rest.\r\n\r\nThe third article of the Declaration of Rights says:\r\n\r\n\"Liberty consists in such acts of volition as are not injurious to\r\nothers.\"\r\n\r\nBut the article of the Constitution, on which I have observed, breaks\r\ndown this barrier. It enables the liberty of one part of society to\r\ndestroy the freedom of the other.\r\n\r\nHaving thus pointed out the inconsistency of this article to the\r\nDeclaration of Rights, I shall proceed to comment on that of the same\r\narticle which makes a direct contribution a necessary qualification to\r\nthe right of citizenship.\r\n\r\nA modern refinement on the object of public revenue has divided the\r\ntaxes, or contributions, into two classes, the _direct_ and the_\r\nindirect_, without being able to define precisely the distinction or\r\ndifference between them, because the effect of both is the same.\r\n\r\nThose are designated indirect taxes which fall upon the consumers of\r\ncertain articles, on which the tax is imposed, because, the tax being\r\nincluded in the price, the consumer pays it without taking notice of it.\r\n\r\nThe same observation is applicable to the territorial tax. The land\r\nproprietors, in order to reimburse themselves, will rack-rent their\r\ntenants: the farmer, of course, will transfer the obligation to the\r\nmiller, by enhancing the price of grain; the miller to the baker, by\r\nincreasing the price of flour; and the baker to the consumer, by raising\r\nthe price of bread. The territorial tax, therefore, though called\r\n_direct_, is, in its consequences, _indirect_.\r\n\r\nTo this tax the land proprietor contributes only in proportion to the\r\nquantity of bread and other provisions that are consumed in his own\r\nfamily. The deficit is furnished by the great mass of the community,\r\nwhich comprehends every individual of the nation.\r\n\r\nFrom the logical distinction between the direct and in-direct taxation,\r\nsome emolument may result, I allow, to auditors of public accounts, &c.,\r\nbut to the people at large I deny that such a distinction (which by the\r\nby is without a difference) can be productive of any practical\r\nbenefit. It ought not, therefore, to be admitted as a principle in the\r\nconstitution.\r\n\r\nBesides this objection, the provision in question does not affect to\r\ndefine, secure, or establish the right of citizenship. It consigns to\r\nthe caprice or discretion of the legislature the power of pronouncing\r\nwho shall, or shall not, exercise the functions of a citizen; and\r\nthis may be done effectually, either by the imposition of a _direct or\r\nindirect_ tax, according to the selfish views of the legislators, or by\r\nthe mode of collecting the taxes so imposed.\r\n\r\nNeither a tenant who occupies an extensive farm, nor a merchant or\r\nmanufacturer who may have embarked a large capital in their respective\r\npursuits, can ever, according to this system, attain the preemption\r\nof a citizen. On the other hand, any upstart, who has, by succession\r\nor management, got possession of a few acres of land or a miserable\r\ntenement, may exultingly exercise the functions of a citizen, although\r\nperhaps neither possesses a hundredth part of the worth or property of a\r\nsimple mechanic, nor contributes in any proportion to the exigencies of\r\nthe State.\r\n\r\nThe contempt in which the old government held mercantile pursuits, and\r\nthe obloquy that attached on merchants and manufacturers, contributed\r\nnot a little to its embarrassments, and its eventual subversion; and,\r\nstrange to tell, though the mischiefs arising from this mode of conduct\r\nare so obvious, yet an article is proposed for your adoption which has a\r\nmanifest tendency to restore a defect inherent in the monarchy.\r\n\r\n\r\nI shall now proceed to the second article of the same Title, with which\r\nI shall conclude my remarks.\r\n\r\nThe second article says, \"Every French soldier, who shall have served\r\none or more campaigns in the cause of liberty, is deemed a citizen\r\nof the republic, without any respect or reference to other\r\nqualifications.\"(1)\r\n\r\nIt would seem, that in this Article the Committee were desirous of\r\nextricating themselves from a dilemma into which they had been plunged\r\nby the preceding article. When men depart from an established principle\r\nthey are compelled to resort to trick and subterfuge, always shifting\r\ntheir means to preserve the unity of their objects; and as it rarely\r\nhappens that the first expedient makes amends for the prostitution of\r\nprinciple, they must call in aid a second, of a more flagrant nature,\r\nto supply the deficiency of the former. In this manner legislators go\r\non accumulating error upon error, and artifice upon artifice, until\r\nthe mass becomes so bulky and incongruous, and their embarrassment so\r\ndesperate, that they are compelled, as their last expedient, to resort\r\nto the very principle they had violated. The Committee were precisely\r\nin this predicament when they framed this article; and to me, I confess,\r\ntheir conduct appears specious rather than efficacious.(2)\r\n\r\n     1 This article eventually stood: \"All Frenchmen who shall\r\n     have made one or more campaigns for the establishment of the\r\n     Republic, are citizens, without condition as to taxes.\"--\r\n     _Editor._\r\n\r\n     2 The head of the Committee (eleven) was the Abbé Sieves,\r\n     whose political treachery was well known to Paine before it\r\n     became known to the world by his services to Napoleon in\r\n     overthrowing the Republic.--_Editor._\r\n\r\nIt was not for himself alone, but for his family, that the French\r\ncitizen, at the dawn of the revolution, (for then indeed every man\r\nwas considered a citizen) marched soldier-like to the frontiers, and\r\nrepelled a foreign invasion. He had it not in his contemplation, that he\r\nshould enjoy liberty for the residue of his earthly career, and by his\r\nown act preclude his offspring from that inestimable blessing. No! He\r\nwished to leave it as an inheritance to his children, and that they\r\nmight hand it down to their latest posterity. If a Frenchman, who united\r\nin his person the character of a Soldier and a Citizen, was now to\r\nreturn from the army to his peaceful habitation, he must address his\r\nsmall family in this manner: \"Sorry I am, that I cannot leave to you\r\na small portion of what I have acquired by exposing my person to\r\nthe ferocity of our enemies and defeating their machinations. I have\r\nestablished the republic, and, painful the reflection, all the laurels\r\nwhich I have won in the field are blasted, and all the privileges to\r\nwhich my exertions have entitled me extend not beyond the period of\r\nmy own existence!\" Thus the measure that has been adopted by way of\r\nsubterfuge falls short of what the framers of it speculated upon; for\r\nin conciliating the affections of the _Soldier_, they have subjected\r\nthe _Father_ to the most pungent sensations, by obliging him to adopt a\r\ngeneration of Slaves.\r\n\r\nCitizens, a great deal has been urged respecting insurrections. I am\r\nconfident that no man has a greater abhorrence of them than myself, and\r\nI am sorry that any insinuations should have been thrown out upon me\r\nas a promoter of violence of any kind. The whole tenor of my life and\r\nconversation gives the lie to those calumnies, and proves me to be a\r\nfriend to order, truth and justice.\r\n\r\nI hope you will attribute this effusion of my sentiments to my anxiety\r\nfor the honor and success of the revolution. I have no interest distinct\r\nfrom that which has a tendency to meliorate the situation of mankind.\r\nThe revolution, as far as it respects myself, has been productive of\r\nmore loss and persecution than it is possible for me to describe, or for\r\nyou to indemnify. But with respect to the subject under consideration, I\r\ncould not refrain from declaring my sentiments.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, if you subvert the basis of the revolution, if you\r\ndispense with principles, and substitute expedients, you will extinguish\r\nthat enthusiasm and energy which have hitherto been the life and soul of\r\nthe revolution; and you will substitute in its place nothing but a\r\ncold indifference and self-interest, which will again degenerate into\r\nintrigue, cunning, and effeminacy.\r\n\r\nBut to discard all considerations of a personal and subordinate nature,\r\nit is essential to the well-being of the republic that the practical or\r\norganic part of the constitution should correspond with its principles;\r\nand as this does not appear to be the case in the plan that has been\r\npresented to you, it is absolutely necessary that it should be submitted\r\nto the revision of a committee, who should be instructed to compare it\r\nwith the Declaration of Rights, in order to ascertain the difference\r\nbetween the two, and to make such alterations as shall render them\r\nperfectly consistent and compatible with each other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVI. THE DECLINE AND FALL OF THE ENGLISH SYSTEM OF FINANCE.(1)\r\n\r\n     \"On the verge, nay even in the gulph of bankruptcy.\"\r\n\r\n     1 This pamphlet, as Paine predicts at its close (no doubt on\r\n     good grounds), was translated into all languages of Europe,\r\n     and probably hastened the gold suspension of the Bank of\r\n     England (1797), which it predicted. The British Government\r\n     entrusted its reply to Ralph Broome and George Chalmers, who\r\n     wrote pamphlets. There is in the French Archives an order\r\n     for 1000 copies, April 27, 1796, nineteen days after Paine's\r\n     pamphlet appeared. \"Mr. Cobbett has made this little\r\n     pamphlet a text-book for most of his elaborate treatises on\r\n     our finances.... On the authority of a late Register of Mr.\r\n     Cobbett's I learn that the profits arising from the sale of\r\n     this pamphlet were devoted [by Paine] to the relief of the\r\n     prisoners confined in Newgate for debt.\"--\"Life of Paine,\"\r\n     by Richard Carlile, 1819.--_Editor._.\r\n\r\n\r\nDebates in Parliament.\r\n\r\nNothing, they say, is more certain than death, and nothing more\r\nuncertain than the time of dying; yet we can always fix a period beyond\r\nwhich man cannot live, and within some moment of which he will die. We\r\nare enabled to do this, not by any spirit of prophecy, or foresight into\r\nthe event, but by observation of what has happened in all cases of human\r\nor animal existence. If then any other subject, such, for instance, as\r\na system of finance, exhibits in its progress a series of symptoms\r\nindicating decay, its final dissolution is certain, and the period of it\r\ncan be calculated from the symptoms it exhibits.\r\n\r\nThose who have hitherto written on the English system of finance, (the\r\nfunding system,) have been uniformly impressed with the idea that its\r\ndownfall would happen _some time or other_. They took, however, no data\r\nfor their opinion, but expressed it predictively,--or merely as opinion,\r\nfrom a conviction that the perpetual duration of such a system was a\r\nnatural impossibility. It is in this manner that Dr. Price has spoken of\r\nit; and Smith, in his Wealth of Nations, has spoken in the same manner;\r\nthat is, merely as opinion without data. \"The progress,\" says Smith,\r\n\"of the enormous debts, which at present oppress, and will in the long\r\nrun _most probably ruin_, all the great nations of Europe [he should\r\nhave said _governments_] has been pretty uniform.\" But this general\r\nmanner of speaking, though it might make some impression, carried with\r\nit no conviction.\r\n\r\nIt is not my intention to predict any thing; but I will show from data\r\nalready known, from symptoms and facts which the English funding system\r\nhas already exhibited publicly, that it will not continue to the end of\r\nMr. Pitt's life, supposing him to live the usual age of a man. How much\r\nsooner it may fall, I leave to others to predict.\r\n\r\nLet financiers diversify systems of credit as they will, it _is_\r\nnevertheless true, that every system of credit is a system of paper\r\nmoney. Two experiments have already been had upon paper money; the one\r\nin America, the other in France. In both those cases the whole capital\r\nwas emitted, and that whole capital, which in America was called\r\ncontinental money, and in France assignats, appeared in circulation; the\r\nconsequence of which was, that the quantity became so enormous, and so\r\ndisproportioned to the quantity of population, and to the quantity' of\r\nobjects upon which it could be employed, that the market, if I may so\r\nexpress it, was glutted with it, and the value of it fell. Between five\r\nand six years determined the fate of those experiments. The same fate\r\nwould have happened to gold and silver, could gold and silver have been\r\nissued in the same abundant manner that paper had been, and confined\r\nwithin the country as paper money always is, by having no circulation\r\nout of it; or, to speak on a larger scale, the same thing would happen\r\nin the world, could the world be glutted with gold and silver, as\r\nAmerica and France have been with paper.\r\n\r\nThe English system differs from that of America and France in this one\r\nparticular, that its capital is kept out of sight; that is, it does\r\nnot appear in circulation. Were the whole capital of the national debt,\r\nwhich at the time I write this is almost one hundred million pounds\r\nsterling, to be emitted in assignats or bills, and that whole quantity\r\nput into circulation, as was done in America and in France, those\r\nEnglish assignats, or bills, would soon sink in value as those of\r\nAmerica and France have done; and that in a greater degree, because\r\nthe quantity of them would be more disproportioned to the quantity\r\nof population in England, than was the case in either of the other two\r\ncountries. A nominal pound sterling in such bills would not be worth one\r\npenny.\r\n\r\nBut though the English system, by thus keeping the capital out of sight,\r\nis preserved from hasty destruction, as in the case of America and\r\nFrance, it nevertheless approaches the same fate, and will arrive at it\r\nwith the same certainty, though by a slower progress. The difference\r\nis altogether in the degree of speed by which the two systems approach\r\ntheir fate, which, to speak in round numbers, is as twenty is to one;\r\nthat is, the English system, that of funding the capital instead of\r\nissuing it, contained within itself a capacity of enduring twenty times\r\nlonger than the systems adopted by America and France; and at the end of\r\nthat time it would arrive at the same common grave, the Potter's Field\r\nof paper money.\r\n\r\nThe datum, I take for this proportion of twenty to one, is the\r\ndifference between a capital and the interest at five per cent. Twenty\r\ntimes the interest is equal to the capital. The accumulation of paper\r\nmoney in England is in proportion to the accumulation of the interest\r\nupon every new loan; and therefore the progress to the dissolution is\r\ntwenty times slower than if the capital were to be emitted and put into\r\ncirculation immediately. Every twenty years in the English system is\r\nequal to one year in the French and American systems.\r\n\r\nHaving thus stated the duration of the two systems, that of funding upon\r\ninterest, and that of emitting the whole capital without funding, to be\r\nas twenty to one, I come to examine the symptoms of decay, approaching\r\nto dissolution, that the English system has already exhibited, and to\r\ncompare them with similar systems in the French and American systems.\r\n\r\nThe English funding system began one hundred years ago; in which time\r\nthere have been six wars, including the war that ended in 1697.\r\n\r\n1. The war that ended, as I have just said, in 1697.\r\n\r\n2. The war that began in 1702.\r\n\r\n3. The war that began in 1739.\r\n\r\n4. The war that began in 1756.\r\n\r\n5. The American war, that began in 1775.\r\n\r\n6. The present war, that began in 1793.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe national debt, at the conclusion of the war which ended in 1697, was\r\ntwenty-one millions and an half. (See Smith's Wealth of Nations,\r\nchapter on Public Debts.) We now see it approaching fast to four hundred\r\nmillions. If between these two extremes of twenty-one millions and four\r\nhundred millions, embracing the several expenses of all the including\r\nwars, there exist some common ratio that will ascertain arithmetically\r\nthe amount of the debts at the end of each war, as certainly as the fact\r\nis known to be, that ratio will in like manner determine what the amount\r\nof the debt will be in all future wars, and will ascertain the period\r\nwithin which the funding system will expire in a bankruptcy of the\r\ngovernment; for the ratio I allude to, is the ratio which the nature of\r\nthe thing has established for itself.\r\n\r\nHitherto no idea has been entertained that any such ratio existed, or\r\ncould exist, that would determine a problem of this kind; that is, that\r\nwould ascertain, without having any knowledge of the fact, what the\r\nexpense of any former war had been, or what the expense of any future\r\nwar would be; but it is nevertheless true that such a ratio does exist,\r\nas I shall show, and also the mode of applying it.\r\n\r\nThe ratio I allude to is not in arithmetical progression like the\r\nnumbers 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9; nor yet in geometrical progression, like\r\nthe numbers 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256; but it is in the series of\r\none half upon each preceding number; like the numbers 8, 12, 18, 27, 40,\r\n60, 90, 135.\r\n\r\nAny person can perceive that the second number, 12, is produced by the\r\npreceding number, 8, and half 8; and that the third number, 18, is in\r\nlike manner produced by the preceding number, 12, and half 12; and so\r\non for the rest. They can also see how rapidly the sums increase as\r\nthe ratio proceeds. The difference between the two first numbers is but\r\nfour; but the difference between the two last is forty-five; and from\r\nthence they may see with what immense rapidity the national debt has\r\nincreased, and will continue to increase, till it exceeds the ordinary\r\npowers of calculation, and loses itself in ciphers.\r\n\r\nI come now to apply the ratio as a rule to determine in all cases.\r\n\r\nI began with the war that ended in 1697, which was the war in which the\r\nfunding system began. The expense of that war was twenty-one millions\r\nand an half. In order to ascertain the expense of the next war, I add\r\nto twenty-one millions and an half, the half thereof (ten millions and\r\nthree quarters) which makes thirty-two millions and a quarter for the\r\nexpense of that war. This thirty-two millions and a quarter, added to\r\nthe former debt of twenty-one millions and an half, carries the national\r\ndebt to fifty-three millions and three quarters. Smith, in his\r\nchapter on Public Debts, says, that the national debt was at this time\r\nfifty-three millions.\r\n\r\nI proceed to ascertain the expense of the next war, that of 1739, by\r\nadding, as in the former case, one half to the expense of the preceding\r\nwar. The expense of the preceding war was thirty-two millions and a\r\nquarter; for the sake of even numbers, say, thirty-two millions; the\r\nhalf of which (16) makes forty-eight millions for the expense of that\r\nwar.\r\n\r\nI proceed to ascertain the expense of the war of 1756, by adding,\r\naccording to the ratio, one half to the expense of the preceding war.\r\nThe expense of the preceding was taken at 48 millions, the half of which\r\n(24) makes 72 millions for the expense of that war. Smith, (chapter on\r\nPublic Debts,) says, the expense of the war of 1756, was 72 millions and\r\na quarter.\r\n\r\nI proceed to ascertain the expense of the American war, of 1775, by\r\nadding, as in the former cases, one half to the expense of the preceding\r\nwar. The expense of the preceding war was 72 millions, the half of which\r\n(36) makes 108 millions for the expense of that war. In the last\r\nedition of Smith, (chapter on Public Debts,) he says, the expense of the\r\nAmerican war was _more than an hundred millions_.\r\n\r\nI come now to ascertain the expense of the present war, supposing it to\r\ncontinue as long as former wars have done, and the funding system not\r\nto break up before that period. The expense of the preceding war was 108\r\nmillions, the half of which (54) makes 162 millions for the expense of\r\nthe present war. It gives symptoms of going beyond this sum, supposing\r\nthe funding system not to break up; for the loans of the last year and\r\nof the present year are twenty-two millions each, which exceeds the\r\nratio compared with the loans of the preceding war. It will not be from\r\nthe inability of procuring loans that the system will break up. On\r\nthe contrary, it is the facility with which loans can be procured that\r\nhastens that event. The loans are altogether paper transactions; and\r\nit is the excess of them that brings on, with accelerating speed, that\r\nprogressive depreciation of funded paper money that will dissolve the\r\nfunding system.\r\n\r\nI proceed to ascertain the expense of future wars, and I do this merely\r\nto show the impossibility of the continuance of the funding system, and\r\nthe certainty of its dissolution.\r\n\r\nThe expense of the next war after the present war, according to the\r\nratio that has ascertained the preceding cases, will be 243 millions.\r\n\r\nExpense of the second war 364\r\n\r\n---------------- third war 546\r\n\r\n---------------- fourth war 819\r\n\r\n-------- fifth war 1228\r\n\r\n                                                        3200 millions;\r\n\r\nwhich, at only four per cent. will require taxes to the nominal amount\r\nof one hundred and twenty-eight millions to pay the annual interest,\r\nbesides the interest of the present debt, and the expenses of\r\ngovernment, which are not included in this account. Is there a man so\r\nmad, so stupid, as to sup-pose this system can continue?\r\n\r\nWhen I first conceived the idea of seeking for some common ratio that\r\nshould apply as a rule of measurement to all the cases of the funding\r\nsystem, so far as to ascertain the several stages of its approach to\r\ndissolution, I had no expectation that any ratio could be found that\r\nwould apply with so much exactness as this does. I was led to the idea\r\nmerely by observing that the funding system was a thing in continual\r\nprogression, and that whatever was in a state of progression might be\r\nsupposed to admit of, at least, some general ratio of measurement,\r\nthat would apply without any very great variation. But who could have\r\nsupposed that falling systems, or falling opinions, admitted of a ratio\r\napparently as true as the descent of falling bodies? I have not made the\r\nratio any more than Newton made the ratio of gravitation. I have only\r\ndiscovered it, and explained the mode of applying it.\r\n\r\nTo shew at one view the rapid progression of the funding system to\r\ndestruction, and to expose the folly of those who blindly believe in\r\nits continuance, and who artfully endeavour to impose that belief upon\r\nothers, I exhibit in the annexed table, the expense of each of the six\r\nwars since the funding system began, as ascertained by ratio, and the\r\nexpense of the six wars yet to come, ascertained by the same ratio.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Table318]\r\n\r\n     * The actual expense of the war of 1739 did not come up to\r\n     the sum ascertained by the ratio.   But as that which is the\r\n     natural disposition of a thing, as it is the natural\r\n     disposition of a stream of water to descend, will, if\r\n     impeded in its course, overcome by a new effort what it had\r\n     lost by that impediment, so it was with respect to this war\r\n     and the next (1756) taken collectively; for the expense of\r\n     the war of 1756 restored the equilibrium of the ratio, as\r\n     fully as if it had not been impeded. A circumstance that\r\n     serves to prove the truth of the ratio more folly than if\r\n     the interruption had not taken place. The war of 1739 ***\r\n     languid; the efforts were below the value of money et that\r\n     time; for the ratio is the measure of the depreciation of\r\n     money in consequence of the funding system; or what comes\r\n     to the same end, it is the measure of the increase of paper.\r\n     Every additional quantity of it, whether in bank notes or\r\n     otherwise, diminishes the real, though not the nominal value\r\n     of the former quantity.--_Author_\r\n\r\n\r\nThose who are acquainted with the power with which even a small ratio,\r\nacting in progression, multiplies in a long series, will see nothing to\r\nwonder at in this table. Those who are not acquainted with that subject,\r\nand not knowing what else to say, may be inclined to deny it. But it is\r\nnot their opinion one way, nor mine the other, that can influence the\r\nevent. The table exhibits the natural march of the funding system to its\r\nirredeemable dissolution. Supposing the present government of England to\r\ncontinue, and to go on as it has gone on since the funding system began,\r\nI would not give twenty shillings for one hundred pounds in the funds to\r\nbe paid twenty years hence. I do not speak this predictively; I produce\r\nthe data upon which that belief is founded; and which data it is every\r\nbody's interest to know, who have any thing to do with the funds, or\r\nwho are going to bequeath property to their descendants to be paid at a\r\nfuture day.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it may be asked, that as governments or ministers proceeded by\r\nno ratio in making loans or incurring debts, and nobody intended any\r\nratio, or thought of any, how does it happen that there is one? I\r\nanswer, that the ratio is founded in necessity; and I now go to explain\r\nwhat that necessity is.\r\n\r\nIt will always happen, that the price of labour, or of the produce\r\nof labour, be that produce what it may, will be in proportion to the\r\nquantity of money in a country, admitting things to take their natural\r\ncourse. Before the invention of the funding system, there was no other\r\nmoney than gold and silver; and as nature gives out those metals with\r\na sparing hand, and in regular annual quantities from the mines, the\r\nseveral prices of things were proportioned to the quantity of money at\r\nthat time, and so nearly stationary as to vary but little in any fifty\r\nor sixty years of that period.\r\n\r\nWhen the funding system began, a substitute for gold and silver began\r\nalso. That substitute was paper; and the quantity increased as the\r\nquantity of interest increased upon accumulated loans. This appearance\r\nof a new and additional species of money in the nation soon began to\r\nbreak the relative value which money and the things it will purchase\r\nbore to each other before. Every thing rose in price; but the rise at\r\nfirst was little and slow, like the difference in units between two\r\nfirst numbers, 8 and 12, compared with the two last numbers 90 and 135,\r\nin the table. It was however sufficient to make itself considerably felt\r\nin a large transaction. When therefore government, by engaging in a new\r\nwar, required a new loan, it was obliged to make a higher loan than the\r\nformer loan, to balance the increased price to which things had risen;\r\nand as that new loan increased the quantity of paper in proportion\r\nto the new quantity of interest, it carried the price of things still\r\nhigher than before. The next loan was again higher, to balance that\r\nfurther increased price; and all this in the same manner, though not\r\nin the same degree, that every new emission of continental money in\r\nAmerica, or of assignats in France, was greater than the preceding\r\nemission, to make head against the advance of prices, till the combat\r\ncould be maintained no longer. Herein is founded the necessity of which\r\nI have just spoken. That necessity proceeds with accelerating velocity,\r\nand the ratio I have laid down is the measure of that acceleration; or,\r\nto speak the technical language of the subject, it is the measure of the\r\nincreasing depreciation of funded paper money, which it is impossible to\r\nprevent while the quantity of that money and of bank notes continues to\r\nmultiply. What else but this can account for the difference between one\r\nwar costing 21 millions, and another war costing 160 millions?\r\n\r\nThe difference cannot be accounted for on the score of extraordinary\r\nefforts or extraordinary achievements. The war that cost twenty-one\r\nmillions was the war of the con-federates, historically called the grand\r\nalliance, consisting of England, Austria, and Holland in the time of\r\nWilliam III. against Louis XIV. and in which the confederates were\r\nvictorious. The present is a war of a much greater confederacy--a\r\nconfederacy of England, Austria, Prussia, the German Empire, Spain,\r\nHolland, Naples, and Sardinia, eight powers, against the French Republic\r\nsingly, and the Republic has beaten the whole confederacy.--But to\r\nreturn to my subject.\r\n\r\nIt is said in England, that the value of paper keeps equal with the\r\nvalue of gold and silver. But the case is not rightly stated; for the\r\nfact is, that the paper has _pulled down_ the value of gold and silver\r\nto a level with itself. Gold and silver will not purchase so much of any\r\npurchasable article at this day as if no paper had appeared, nor so much\r\nas it will in any country in Europe where there is no paper. How long\r\nthis hanging together of money and paper will continue, makes a new\r\ncase; because it daily exposes the system to sudden death, independent\r\nof the natural death it would otherwise suffer.\r\n\r\nI consider the funding system as being now advanced into the last twenty\r\nyears of its existence. The single circumstance, were there no other,\r\nthat a war should now cost nominally one hundred and sixty millions,\r\nwhich when the system began cost but twenty-one millions, or that the\r\nloan for one year only (including the loan to the Emperor) should now be\r\nnominally greater than the whole expense of that war, shows the state of\r\ndepreciation to which the funding system has arrived. Its depreciation\r\nis in the proportion of eight for one, compared with the value of its\r\nmoney when the system began; which is the state the French assignats\r\nstood a year ago (March 1795) compared with gold and silver. It is\r\ntherefore that I say, that the English funding system has entered on the\r\nlast twenty years of its existence, comparing each twenty years of\r\nthe English system with every single year of the American and French\r\nsystems, as before stated.\r\n\r\nAgain, supposing the present war to close as former wars have done, and\r\nwithout producing either revolution or reform in England, another war at\r\nleast must be looked for in the space of the twenty years I allude to;\r\nfor it has never yet happened that twenty years have passed off without\r\na war, and that more especially since the English government has dabbled\r\nin German politics, and shown a disposition to insult the world, and the\r\nworld of commerce, with her navy. The next war will carry the national\r\ndebt to very nearly seven hundred millions, the interest of which, at\r\nfour per cent, will be twenty-eight millions besides the taxes for\r\nthe (then) expenses of government, which will increase in the same\r\nproportion, and which will carry the taxes to at least forty millions;\r\nand if another war only begins, it will quickly carry them to above\r\nfifty; for it is in the last twenty years of the funding system, as in\r\nthe last year of the American and French systems without funding, that\r\nall the great shocks begin to operate.\r\n\r\nI have just mentioned that, paper in England has _pulled down_ the value\r\nof gold and silver to a level with itself; and that _this pulling dawn_\r\nof gold and silver money has created the appearance of paper money\r\nkeeping up. The same thing, and the same mistake, took place in\r\nAmerica and in France, and continued for a considerable time after the\r\ncommencement of their system of paper; and the actual depreciation of\r\nmoney was hidden under that mistake.\r\n\r\nIt was said in America, at that time, that everything was becoming\r\n_dear_; but gold and silver could then buy those dear articles no\r\ncheaper than paper could; and therefore it was not called depreciation.\r\nThe idea of _dearness_ established itself for the idea of depreciation.\r\nThe same was the case in France. Though every thing rose in price soon\r\nafter assignats appeared, yet those dear articles could be purchased no\r\ncheaper with gold and silver, than with paper, and it was only said that\r\nthings were _dear_. The same is still the language in England. They\r\ncall it _deariness_. But they will soon find that it is an actual\r\ndepreciation, and that this depreciation is the effect of the funding\r\nsystem; which, by crowding such a continually increasing mass of paper\r\ninto circulation, carries down the value of gold and silver with it. But\r\ngold and silver, will, in the long run, revolt against depreciation, and\r\nseparate from the value of paper; for the progress of all such systems\r\nappears to be, that the paper will take the command in the beginning,\r\nand gold and silver in the end.\r\n\r\nBut this succession in the command of gold and silver over paper, makes\r\na crisis far more eventful to the funding system than to any other\r\nsystem upon which paper can be issued; for, strictly speaking, it is not\r\na crisis of danger but a symptom of death. It is a death-stroke to the\r\nfunding system. It is a revolution in the whole of its affairs.\r\n\r\nIf paper be issued without being funded upon interest, emissions of it\r\ncan be continued after the value of it separates from gold and silver,\r\nas we have seen in the two cases of America and France. But the funding\r\nsystem rests altogether upon the value of paper being equal to gold and\r\nsilver; which will be as long as the paper can continue carrying down\r\nthe value of gold and silver to the same level to which itself descends,\r\nand no longer. But even in this state, that of descending equally\r\ntogether, the minister, whoever he may be, will find himself beset with\r\naccumulating difficulties; because the loans and taxes voted for the\r\nservice of each ensuing year will wither in his hands before the year\r\nexpires, or before they can be applied. This will force him to have\r\nrecourse to emissions of what are called exchequer and navy bills,\r\nwhich, by still increasing the mass of paper in circulation, will drive\r\non the depreciation still more rapidly.\r\n\r\nIt ought to be known that taxes in England are not paid in gold\r\nand silver, but in paper (bank notes). Every person who pays any\r\nconsiderable quantity of taxes, such as maltsters, brewers, distillers,\r\n(I appeal for the truth of it, to any of the collectors of excise in\r\nEngland, or to Mr. White-bread,)(1) knows this to be the case. There is\r\nnot gold and silver enough in the nation to pay the taxes in coin, as\r\nI shall show; and consequently there is not money enough in the bank to\r\npay the notes. The interest of the national funded debt is paid at the\r\nbank in the same kind of paper in which the taxes are collected. When\r\npeople find, as they will find, a reservedness among each other in\r\ngiving gold and silver for bank notes, or the least preference for the\r\nformer over the latter, they will go for payment to the bank, where they\r\nhave a right to go. They will do this as a measure of prudence, each one\r\nfor himself, and the truth or delusion of the funding system will then\r\nbe proved.\r\n\r\n     1 An eminent Member of Parliament.--_Editor._.\r\n\r\nI have said in the foregoing paragraph that there is not gold and silver\r\nenough in the nation to pay the taxes in coin, and consequently that\r\nthere cannot be enough in the bank to pay the notes. As I do not choose\r\nto rest anything upon assertion, I appeal for the truth of this to the\r\npublications of Mr. Eden (now called Lord Auckland) and George Chalmers,\r\nSecretary to the Board of Trade and Plantation, of which Jenkinson (now\r\nLord Hawkesbury) is president.(1) (These sort of folks change their\r\nnames so often that it is as difficult to know them as it is to know\r\na thief.) Chalmers gives the quantity of gold and silver coin from the\r\nreturns of coinage at the Mint; and after deducting for the light gold\r\nrecoined, says that the amount of gold and silver coined is about twenty\r\nmillions. He had better not have proved this, especially if he had\r\nreflected that _public credit is suspicion asleep_. The quantity is much\r\ntoo little.\r\n\r\n     1 Concerning Chalmers and Hawkesbury see vol. ii., p. 533.\r\n     Also, preface to my \"Life of Paine\",  xvi., and other\r\n     passages.---_Editor._.\r\n\r\nOf this twenty millions (which is not a fourth part of the quantity of\r\ngold and silver there is in France, as is shown in Mr. Neckar's Treatise\r\non the Administration of the Finances) three millions at least must be\r\nsupposed to be in Ireland, some in Scotland, and in the West Indies,\r\nNewfoundland, &c. The quantity therefore in England cannot be more than\r\nsixteen millions, which is four millions less than the amount of the\r\ntaxes. But admitting that there are sixteen millions, not more than\r\na fourth part thereof (four millions) can be in London, when it is\r\nconsidered that every city, town, village, and farm-house in the nation\r\nmust have a part of it, and that all the great manufactories, which most\r\nrequire cash, are out of London. Of this four millions in London, every\r\nbanker, merchant, tradesman, in short every individual, must have some.\r\nHe must be a poor shopkeeper indeed, who has not a few guineas in his\r\ntill. The quantity of cash therefore in the bank can never, on the\r\nevidence of circumstances, be so much as two millions; most probably\r\nnot more than one million; and on this slender twig, always liable to be\r\nbroken, hangs the whole funding system of four hundred millions, besides\r\nmany millions in bank notes. The sum in the bank is not sufficient to\r\npay one-fourth of only one year's interest of the national debt, were\r\nthe creditors to demand payment in cash, or demand cash for the bank\r\nnotes in which the interest is paid, a circumstance always liable to\r\nhappen.\r\n\r\nOne of the amusements that has kept up the farce of the funding system\r\nis, that the interest is regularly paid. But as the interest is always\r\npaid in bank notes, and as bank notes can always be coined for the\r\npurpose, this mode of payment proves nothing. The point of proof is, can\r\nthe bank give cash for the bank notes with which the interest is paid?\r\nIf it cannot, and it is evident it cannot, some millions of bank notes\r\nmust go without payment, and those holders of bank notes who apply last\r\nwill be worst off. When the present quantity of cash in the bank is paid\r\naway, it is next to impossible to see how any new quantity is to arrive.\r\nNone will arrive from taxes, for the taxes will all be paid in bank\r\nnotes; and should the government refuse bank notes in payment of taxes,\r\nthe credit of bank notes will be gone at once. No cash will arise from\r\nthe business of discounting merchants' bills; for every merchant will\r\npay off those bills in bank notes, and not in cash. There is therefore\r\nno means left for the bank to obtain a new supply of cash, after the\r\npresent quantity is paid away. But besides the impossibility of paying\r\nthe interest of the funded debt in cash, there are many thousand\r\npersons, in London and in the country, who are holders of bank notes\r\nthat came into their hands in the fair way of trade, and who are not\r\nstockholders in the funds; and as such persons have had no hand in\r\nincreasing the demand upon the bank, as those have had who for their own\r\nprivate interest, like Boyd and others, are contracting or pretending to\r\ncontract for new loans, they will conceive they have a just right that\r\ntheir bank notes should be paid first. Boyd has been very sly in France,\r\nin changing his paper into cash. He will be just as sly in doing the\r\nsame thing in London, for he has learned to calculate; and then it is\r\nprobable he will set off for America.\r\n\r\nA stoppage of payment at the bank is not a new thing. Smith in his\r\nWealth of Nations, book ii. chap. 2, says, that in the year 1696,\r\nexchequer bills fell forty, fifty, and sixty per cent; bank notes twenty\r\nper cent; and the bank stopped payment. That which happened in 1696 may\r\nhappen again in 1796. The period in which it happened was the last year\r\nof the war of King William. It necessarily put a stop to the further\r\nemissions of exchequer and navy bills, and to the raising of new loans;\r\nand the peace which took place the next year was probably hurried on by\r\nthis circumstance, and saved the bank from bankruptcy. Smith in speaking\r\nfrom the circumstances of the bank, upon another occasion, says (book\r\nii. chap. 2.) \"This great company had been reduced to the necessity\r\nof paying in sixpences.\" When a bank adopts the expedient of paying in\r\nsixpences, it is a confession of insolvency.\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of observation, that every case of failure in finances,\r\nsince the system of paper began, has produced a revolution in\r\ngovernments, either total or partial. A failure in the finances of\r\nFrance produced the French revolution. A failure in the finance of\r\nthe assignats broke up the revolutionary government, and produced\r\nthe present French Constitution. A failure in the finances of the Old\r\nCongress of America, and the embarrassments it brought upon commerce,\r\nbroke up the system of the old confederation, and produced the federal\r\nConstitution. If, then, we admit of reasoning by comparison of causes\r\nand events, the failure of the English finances will produce some change\r\nin the government of that country.\r\n\r\nAs to Mr. Pitt's project of paying off the national debt by applying\r\na million a-year for that purpose, while he continues adding more than\r\ntwenty millions a-year to it, it is like setting a man with a wooden leg\r\nto run after a hare. The longer he runs the farther he is off.\r\n\r\nWhen I said that the funding system had entered the last twenty years\r\nof its existence, I certainly did not mean that it would continue twenty\r\nyears, and then expire as a lease would do. I meant to describe that\r\nage of decrepitude in which death is every day to be expected, and life\r\ncannot continue long. But the death of credit, or that state that is\r\ncalled bankruptcy, is not always marked by those progressive stages\r\nof visible decline that marked the decline of natural life. In the\r\nprogression of natural life age cannot counterfeit youth, nor conceal\r\nthe departure of juvenile abilities. But it is otherwise with respect\r\nto the death of credit; for though all the approaches to bankruptcy\r\nmay actually exist in circumstances, they admit of being concealed by\r\nappearances. Nothing is more common than to see the bankrupt of to-day a\r\nman in credit but the day before; yet no sooner is the real state of\r\nhis affairs known, than every body can see he had been insolvent long\r\nbefore. In London, the greatest theatre of bankruptcy in Europe, this\r\npart of the subject will be well and feelingly understood.\r\n\r\nMr. Pitt continually talks of credit, and the national resources. These\r\nare two of the feigned appearances by which the approaches to bankruptcy\r\nare concealed. That which he calls credit may exist, as I have just\r\nshown, in a state of insolvency, and is always what I have before\r\ndescribed it to be, _suspicion asleep_.\r\n\r\nAs to national resources, Mr. Pitt, like all English financiers that\r\npreceded him since the funding system began, has uniformly mistaken the\r\nnature of a resource; that is, they have mistaken it consistently with\r\nthe delusion of the funding system; but time is explaining the delusion.\r\nThat which he calls, and which they call, a resource, is not a resource,\r\nbut is the _anticipation_ of a resource. They have anticipated what\r\n_would have been_ a resource in another generation, had not the use of\r\nit been so anticipated. The funding system is a system of anticipation.\r\nThose who established it an hundred years ago anticipated the resources\r\nof those who were to live an hundred years after; for the people of the\r\npresent day have to pay the interest of the debts contracted at that\r\ntime, and all debts contracted since. But it is the last feather that\r\nbreaks the horse's back. Had the system begun an hundred years before,\r\nthe amount of taxes at this time to pay the annual interest at four per\r\ncent. (could we suppose such a system of insanity could have continued)\r\nwould be two hundred and twenty millions annually: for the capital of\r\nthe debt would be 5486 millions, according to the ratio that ascertains\r\nthe expense of the wars for the hundred years that are past. But long\r\nbefore it could have reached this period, the value of bank notes,\r\nfrom the immense quantity of them, (for it is in paper only that such\r\na nominal revenue could be collected,) would have been as low or lower\r\nthan continental paper has been in America, or assignats in France; and\r\nas to the idea of exchanging them for gold and silver, it is too absurd\r\nto be contradicted.\r\n\r\nDo we not see that nature, in all her operations, disowns the visionary\r\nbasis upon which the funding system is built? She acts always by\r\nrenewed successions, and never by accumulating additions perpetually\r\nprogressing. Animals and vegetables, men and trees, have existed since\r\nthe world began: but that existence has been carried on by succession\r\nof generations, and not by continuing the same men and the same trees in\r\nexistence that existed first; and to make room for the new she removes\r\nthe old. Every natural idiot can see this; it is the stock-jobbing idiot\r\nonly that mistakes. He has conceived that art can do what nature cannot.\r\nHe is teaching her a new system--that there is no occasion for man to\r\ndie--that the scheme of creation can be carried on upon the plan of\r\nthe funding system--that it can proceed by continual additions of new\r\nbeings, like new loans, and all live together in eternal youth. Go,\r\ncount the graves, thou idiot, and learn the folly of thy arithmetic!\r\n\r\nBut besides these things, there is something visibly farcical in the\r\nwhole operation of loaning. It is scarcely more than four years ago\r\nthat such a rot of bankruptcy spread itself over London, that the whole\r\ncommercial fabric tottered; trade and credit were at a stand; and\r\nsuch was the state of things that, to prevent or suspend a general\r\nbankruptcy, the government lent the merchants six millions in\r\n_government_ paper, and now the merchants lend the government twenty-two\r\nmillions in _their_ paper; and two parties, Boyd and Morgan, men but\r\nlittle known, contend who shall be the lenders. What a farce is this!\r\nIt reduces the operation of loaning to accommodation paper, in which\r\nthe competitors contend, not who shall lend, but who shall sign, because\r\nthere is something to be got for signing.\r\n\r\nEvery English stock-jobber and minister boasts of the credit of England.\r\nIts credit, say they, is greater than that of any country in Europe.\r\nThere is a good reason for this: for there is not another country in\r\nEurope that could be made the dupe of such a delusion. The English\r\nfunding system will remain a monument of wonder, not so much on account\r\nof the extent to which it has been carried, as of the folly of believing\r\nin it.\r\n\r\nThose who had formerly predicted that the funding system would break\r\nup when the debt should amount to one hundred or one hundred and fifty\r\nmillions, erred only in not distinguishing between insolvency and actual\r\nbankruptcy; for the insolvency commenced as soon as the government\r\nbecame unable to pay the interest in cash, or to give cash for the bank\r\nnotes in which the interest was paid, whether that inability was known\r\nor not, or whether it was suspected or not. Insolvency always takes\r\nplace before bankruptcy; for bankruptcy is nothing more than the\r\npublication of that insolvency. In the affairs of an individual, it\r\noften happens that insolvency exists several years before bankruptcy,\r\nand that the insolvency is concealed and carried on till the individual\r\nis not able to pay one shilling in the pound. A government can ward off\r\nbankruptcy longer than an individual: but insolvency will inevitably\r\nproduce bankruptcy, whether in an individual or in a government. If then\r\nthe quantity of bank notes payable on demand, which the bank has issued,\r\nare greater than the bank can pay off, the bank is insolvent: and when\r\nthat insolvency is declared, it is bankruptcy.(*)\r\n\r\n     *  Among the delusions that have been imposed upon the\r\n     nation by ministers to give a false colouring to its\r\n     affairs, and by none more than by Mr. Pitt, is a motley,\r\n     amphibious-charactered thing called the _balance of trade_.\r\n     This balance of trade, as it is called, is taken from the\r\n     custom-house books, in which entries are made of all cargoes\r\n     exported, and also of all cargoes imported, in each year;\r\n     and when the value of the exports, according to the price\r\n     set upon them by the exporter or by the custom-house, is\r\n     greater than the value of the imports, estimated in the same\r\n     manner, they say the balance of trade is much in their\r\n     favour.\r\n\r\n     The custom-house books prove regularly enough that so many\r\n     cargoes have been exported, and so many imported; but this\r\n     is all that they prove, or were intended to prove. They have\r\n     nothing to do with the balance of profit or loss; and it is\r\n     ignorance to appeal to them upon that account: for the case\r\n     is, that the greater the loss is in any one year, the higher\r\n     will this thing called the balance of trade appear to be\r\n     according to the custom-house books. For example, nearly the\r\n     whole of the Mediterranean convoy has been taken by the\r\n     French this year; consequently those cargoes will not\r\n     appear as imports on the custom-house books, and therefore\r\n     the balance of trade, by which they mean the profits of it,\r\n     will appear to be so much the greater as the loss amounts to;\r\n     and, on the other hand, had the loss not happened, the\r\n     profits would have appeared to have been so much the less.\r\n     All the losses happening at sea to returning cargoes, by\r\n     accidents, by the elements, or by capture, make the balance\r\n     appear the higher on the side of the exports; and were they\r\n     all lost at sea, it would appear to be all profit on the\r\n     custom-house books. Also every cargo of exports that is lost\r\n     that occasions another to be sent, adds in like manner to\r\n     the side of the exports, and appears as profit. This year\r\n     the balance of trade will appear high, because the losses\r\n     have been great by capture and by storms. The ignorance of\r\n     the British Parliament in listening to this hackneyed\r\n     imposition of ministers about the balance of trade is\r\n     astonishing. It shows how little they know of national\r\n     affairs--and Mr. Grey may as well talk Greek to them, as to\r\n     make motions about the state of the nation. They understand\r\n     only fox-hunting and the game laws,--_Author_.\r\n\r\nI come now to show the several ways by which bank notes get into\r\ncirculation: I shall afterwards offer an estimate on the total quantity\r\nor amount of bank notes existing at this moment.\r\n\r\nThe bank acts in three capacities. As a bank of discount; as a bank of\r\ndeposit; and as a banker for the government.\r\n\r\nFirst, as a bank of discount. The bank discounts merchants' bills of\r\nexchange for two months. When a merchant has a bill that will become due\r\nat the end of two months, and wants payment before that time, the bank\r\nadvances that payment to him, deducting therefrom at the rate of five\r\nper cent, per annum. The bill of exchange remains at the bank as a\r\npledge or pawn, and at the end of two months it must be redeemed. This\r\ntransaction is done altogether in paper; for the profits of the bank,\r\nas a bank of discount, arise entirely from its making use of paper as\r\nmoney. The bank gives bank notes to the merchant in discounting the bill\r\nof exchange, and the redeemer of the bill pays bank notes to the bank in\r\nredeeming it. It very seldom happens that any real money passes between\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nIf the profits of a bank be, for example, two hundred thousand pounds a\r\nyear (a great sum to be made merely by exchanging one sort of paper\r\nfor another, and which shows also that the merchants of that place are\r\npressed for money for payments, instead of having money to spare to lend\r\nto government,) it proves that the bank discounts to the amount of four\r\nmillions annually, or 666,666L. every two months; and as there never\r\nremain in the bank more than two months' pledges, of the value of\r\n666,666L., at any one time, the amount of bank notes in circulation at\r\nany one time should not be more than to that amount. This is sufficient\r\nto show that the present immense quantity of bank notes, which are\r\ndistributed through every city, town, village, and farm-house in\r\nEngland, cannot be accounted for on the score of discounting.\r\n\r\nSecondly, as a bank of deposit. To deposit money at the bank means to\r\nlodge it there for the sake of convenience, and to be drawn out at any\r\nmoment the depositor pleases, or to be paid away to his order. When\r\nthe business of discounting is great, that of depositing is necessarily\r\nsmall. No man deposits and applies for discounts at the same time;\r\nfor it would be like paying interest for lending money, instead of for\r\nborrowing it. The deposits that are now made at the bank are almost\r\nentirely in bank notes, and consequently they add nothing to the ability\r\nof the bank to pay off the bank notes that may be presented for payment;\r\nand besides this, the deposits are no more the property of the bank than\r\nthe cash or bank notes in a merchant's counting-house are the property\r\nof his book-keeper. No great increase therefore of bank notes, beyond\r\nwhat the discounting business admits, can be accounted for on the score\r\nof deposits.\r\n\r\nThirdly, the bank acts as banker for the government. This is the\r\nconnection that threatens to ruin every public bank. It is through this\r\nconnection that the credit of a bank is forced far beyond what it ought\r\nto be, and still further beyond its ability to pay. It is through this\r\nconnection, that such an immense redundant quantity of bank notes, have\r\ngotten into circulation; and which, instead of being issued because\r\nthere was property in the bank, have been issued because there was none.\r\n\r\nWhen the treasury is empty, which happens in almost every year of every\r\nwar, its coffers at the bank are empty also. It is in this condition of\r\nemptiness that the minister has recourse to emissions of what are called\r\nexchequer and navy bills, which continually generates a new increase of\r\nbank notes, and which are sported upon the public, without there being\r\nproperty in the bank to pay them. These exchequer and navy bills (being,\r\nas I have said, emitted because the treasury and its coffers at the bank\r\nare empty, and cannot pay the demands that come in) are no other than\r\nan acknowledgment that the bearer is entitled to receive so much money.\r\nThey may be compared to the settlement of an account, in which the\r\ndebtor acknowledges the balance he owes, and for which he gives a note\r\nof hand; or to a note of hand given to raise money upon it.\r\n\r\nSometimes the bank discounts those bills as it would discount merchants'\r\nbills of exchange; sometimes it purchases them of the holders at the\r\ncurrent price; and sometimes it agrees with the ministers to pay an\r\ninterest upon them to the holders, and keep them in circulation. In\r\nevery one of these cases an additional quantity of bank notes gets into\r\ncirculation, and are sported, as I have said, upon the public, without\r\nthere being property in the bank, as banker for the government, to pay\r\nthem; and besides this, the bank has now no money of its own; for the\r\nmoney that was originally subscribed to begin the credit of the bank\r\nwith, at its first establishment, has been lent to government and wasted\r\nlong ago.\r\n\r\n\"The bank\" (says Smith, book ii. chap. 2.) \"acts not only as an ordinary\r\nbank, but as a great engine of State; it receives and pays a greater\r\npart of the annuities which are due to the creditors of the _public_.\"\r\n(It is worth observing, that the _public_, or the _nation_, is always\r\nput for the government, in speaking of debts.) \"It circulates\" (says\r\nSmith) \"exchequer bills, and it advances to government the annual amount\r\nof the land and malt taxes, which are frequently not paid till several\r\nyears afterwards.\" (This advancement is also done in bank notes,\r\nfor which there is not property in the bank.) \"In those different\r\noperations\" (says Smith) \"_its duty to the public_ may sometimes have\r\nobliged it, without any fault of its directors, _to overstock the\r\ncirculation with paper money_.\"--bank notes. How its _duty_ to _the\r\npublic_ can induce it _to overstock that public_ with promissory bank\r\nnotes which it _cannot pay_, and thereby expose the individuals of that\r\npublic to ruin, is too paradoxical to be explained; for it is on\r\nthe credit which individuals _give to the bank_, by receiving and\r\ncirculating its notes, and not upon its _own_ credit or its _own_\r\nproperty, for it has none, that the bank sports. If, however, it be the\r\nduty of the bank to expose the public to this hazard, it is at least\r\nequally the duty of the individuals of that public to get their money\r\nand take care of themselves; and leave it to placemen, pensioners,\r\ngovernment contractors, Reeves' association, and the members of both\r\nhouses of Parliament, who have voted away the money at the nod of\r\nthe minister, to continue the credit if they can, and for which their\r\nestates individually and collectively ought to answer, as far as they\r\nwill go.\r\n\r\nThere has always existed, and still exists, a mysterious, suspicious\r\nconnection, between the minister and the directors of the bank, and\r\nwhich explains itself no otherways than by a continual increase in bank\r\nnotes. Without, therefore, entering into any further details of the\r\nvarious contrivances by which bank notes are issued, and thrown upon the\r\npublic, I proceed, as I before mentioned, to offer an estimate on the\r\ntotal quantity of bank notes in circulation.\r\n\r\nHowever disposed governments may be to wring money by taxes from the\r\npeople, there is a limit to the practice established by the nature of\r\nthings. That limit is the proportion between the quantity of money in a\r\nnation, be that quantity what it may, and the greatest quantity of taxes\r\nthat can be raised upon it. People have other uses for money besides\r\npaying taxes; and it is only a proportional part of the money they can\r\nspare for taxes, as it is only a proportional part they can spare\r\nfor house-rent, for clothing, or for any other particular use. These\r\nproportions find out and establish themselves; and that with such\r\nexactness, that if any one part exceeds its proportion, all the other\r\nparts feel it.\r\n\r\nBefore the invention of paper money (bank notes,) there was no other\r\nmoney in the nation than gold and silver, and the greatest quantity of\r\nmoney that was ever raised in taxes during that period never exceeded a\r\nfourth part of the quantity of money in the nation. It was high taxing\r\nwhen it came to this point. The taxes in the time of William III. never\r\nreached to four millions before the invention of paper, and the quantity\r\nof money in the nation at that time was estimated to be about sixteen\r\nmillions. The same proportions established themselves in France. There\r\nwas no paper money in France before the present revolution, and the\r\ntaxes were collected in gold and silver money. The highest quantity of\r\ntaxes never exceeded twenty-two millions sterling; and the quantity of\r\ngold and silver money in the nation at the same time, as stated by M.\r\nNeckar, from returns of coinage at the Mint, in his Treatise on the\r\nAdministration of the Finances, was about ninety millions sterling. To\r\ngo beyond this limit of a fourth part, in England, they were obliged to\r\nintroduce paper money; and the attempt to go beyond it in France, where\r\npaper could not be introduced, broke up the government. This proportion,\r\ntherefore, of a fourth part, is the limit which the thing establishes\r\nfor itself, be the quantity of money in a nation more or less.\r\n\r\nThe amount of taxes in England at this time is full twenty millions;\r\nand therefore the quantity of gold and silver, and of bank notes, taken\r\ntogether, amounts to eighty millions. The quantity of gold and silver,\r\nas stated by Lord Hawkes-bury's Secretary, George Chalmers, as I have\r\nbefore shown, is twenty millions; and, therefore, the total amount\r\nof bank notes in circulation, all made payable on demand, is sixty\r\nmillions. This enormous sum will astonish the most stupid stock-jobber,\r\nand overpower the credulity of the most thoughtless Englishman: but were\r\nit only a third part of that sum, the bank cannot pay half a crown in\r\nthe pound.\r\n\r\nThere is something curious in the movements of this modern complicated\r\nmachine, the funding system; and it is only now that it is beginning\r\nto unfold the full extent of its movements. In the first part of its\r\nmovements it gives great powers into the hands of government, and in the\r\nlast part it takes them completely away.\r\n\r\nThe funding system set out with raising revenues under the name of\r\nloans, by means of which government became both prodigal and powerful.\r\nThe loaners assumed the name of creditors, and though it was soon\r\ndiscovered that loaning was government-jobbing, those pretended loaners,\r\nor the persons who purchased into the funds afterwards, conceived\r\nthemselves not only to be creditors, but to be the _only_ creditors.\r\n\r\nBut such has been the operation of this complicated machine, the funding\r\nsystem, that it has produced, unperceived, a second generation of\r\ncreditors, more numerous and far more formidable and withal more\r\nreal than the first generation; for every holder of a bank note is a\r\ncreditor, and a real creditor, and the debt due to him is made payable\r\non demand. The debt therefore which the government owes to individuals\r\nis composed of two parts; the one about four hundred millions bearing\r\ninterest, the other about sixty millions payable on demand. The one is\r\ncalled the funded debt, the other is the debt due in bank notes.\r\n\r\nThe second debt (that contained in the bank notes) has, in a great\r\nmeasure, been incurred to pay the interest of the first debt; so that in\r\nfact little or no real interest has been paid by government. The whole\r\nhas been delusion and fraud. Government first contracted a debt, in the\r\nform of loans, with one class of people, and then run clandestinely into\r\ndebt with another class, by means of bank notes, to pay the interest.\r\nGovernment acted of itself in contracting the first debt, and made a\r\nmachine of the bank to contract the second. It is this second debt that\r\nchanges the seat of power and the order of things; for it puts it in\r\nthe power of even a small part of the holders of bank notes (had they no\r\nother motives than disgust at Pitt and Grenville's sedition bills,) to\r\ncontrol any measure of government they found to be injurious to their\r\ninterest; and that not by popular meetings, or popular societies, but\r\nby the simple and easy opera-tion of withholding their credit from that\r\ngovernment; that is, by individually demanding payment at the bank\r\nfor every bank note that comes into their hands. Why should Pitt and\r\nGrenville expect that the very men whom they insult and injure,\r\nshould, at the same time, continue to support the measures of Pitt and\r\nGrenville, by giving credit to their promissory notes of payment? No new\r\nemissions of bank notes could go on while payment was demanding on the\r\nold, and the cash in the bank wasting daily away; nor any new advances\r\nbe made to government, or to the emperor, to carry on the war; nor any\r\nnew emission be made on exchequer bills.\r\n\r\n\"_The bank_\" says Smith, (book ii. chap. 2) \"_is a great engine of\r\nstate_.\" And in the same paragraph he says, \"_The stability of the bank\r\nis equal to that of the British government_;\" which is the same as to\r\nsay that the stability of the government is equal to that of the bank,\r\nand no more. If then the bank cannot pay, the _arch-treasurer_ of the\r\nholy Roman empire (S. R. I. A.*) is a bankrupt. When Folly invented\r\ntitles, she did not attend to their application; forever since the\r\ngovernment of England has been in the hands of _arch-treasurers_, it has\r\nbeen running into bankruptcy; and as to the arch-treasurer _apparent_,\r\nhe has been a bankrupt long ago. What a miserable prospect has England\r\nbefore its eyes!\r\n\r\n     * Put of the inscription on an English guinea.--_Author_.\r\n\r\nBefore the war of 1755 there were no bank notes lower than twenty\r\npounds. During that war, bank notes of fifteen pounds and of ten pounds\r\nwere coined; and now, since the commencement of the present war, they\r\nare coined as low as five pounds. These five-pound notes will circulate\r\nchiefly among little shop-keepers, butchers, bakers, market-people,\r\nrenters of small houses, lodgers, &c. All the high departments of\r\ncommerce and the affluent stations of life were already _overstocked_,\r\nas Smith expresses it, with the bank notes. No place remained open\r\nwherein to crowd an additional quantity of bank notes but among the\r\nclass of people I have just mentioned, and the means of doing this\r\ncould be best effected by coining five-pound notes. This conduct has the\r\nappearance of that of an unprincipled insolvent, who, when on the verge\r\nof bankruptcy to the amount of many thousands, will borrow as low as\r\nfive pounds of the servants in his house, and break the next day.\r\n\r\nBut whatever momentary relief or aid the minister and his bank might\r\nexpect from this low contrivance of five-pound notes, it will increase\r\nthe inability of the bank to pay the higher notes, and hasten the\r\ndestruction of all; for even the small taxes that used to be paid in\r\nmoney will now be paid in those notes, and the bank will soon find\r\nitself with scarcely any other money than what the hair-powder\r\nguinea-tax brings in.\r\n\r\nThe bank notes make the most serious part of the business of finance:\r\nwhat is called the national funded debt is but a trifle when put in\r\ncomparison with it; yet the case of the bank notes has never been\r\ntouched upon. But it certainly ought to be known upon what authority,\r\nwhether that of the minister or of the directors, and upon what\r\nfoundation, such immense quantities are issued. I have stated the amount\r\nof them at sixty millions; I have produced data for that estimation; and\r\nbesides this, the apparent quantity of them, far beyond that of gold and\r\nsilver in the nation, corroborates the statement. But were there but a\r\nthird part of sixty millions, the bank cannot pay half a crown in the\r\npound; for no new supply of money, as before said, can arrive at the\r\nbank, as all the taxes will be paid in paper.\r\n\r\nWhen the funding system began, it was not doubted that the loans that\r\nhad been borrowed would be repaid. Government not only propagated that\r\nbelief, but it began paying them off. In time this profession came to be\r\nabandoned: and it is not difficult to see that bank notes will march\r\nthe same way; for the amount of them is only another debt under another\r\nname; and the probability is that Mr. Pitt will at last propose\r\nfunding them. In that case bank notes will not be so valuable as French\r\nassignats. The assignats have a solid property in reserve, in the\r\nnational domains; bank notes have none; and, besides this, the English\r\nrevenue must then sink down to what the amount of it was before the\r\nfunding system began--between three and four millions; one of which\r\nthe _arch-treasurer_ would require for himself, and the arch-treasurer\r\n_apparent_ would require three-quarters of a million more to pay his\r\ndebts. \"_In France_,\" says Sterne, \"_they order these things better_.\"\r\n\r\nI have now exposed the English system of finance to the eyes of all\r\nnations; for this work will be published in all languages. In doing\r\nthis, I have done an act of justice to those numerous citizens of\r\nneutral nations who have been imposed upon by that fraudulent system,\r\nand who have property at stake upon the event.\r\n\r\nAs an individual citizen of America, and as far as an individual can\r\ngo, I have revenged (if I may use the expression without any immoral\r\nmeaning) the piratical depredations committed on the American commerce\r\nby the English government. I have retaliated for France on the subject\r\nof finance: and I conclude with retorting on Mr. Pitt the expression he\r\nused against France, and say, that the English system of finance \"is on\r\nthe verge, nay even in the\r\n\r\nGULPH OF BANKRUPTCY.\"\r\n\r\nThomas Paine.\r\n\r\nPARIS, 19th Germinal. 4th year of the Republic, April 8, 1796.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVII. FORGETFULNESS.(1)\r\n\r\n     1 This undated composition, of much biographical interest,\r\n     was shown by Paine to Henry Redhead Yorke, who visited him\r\n     in Paris (1802), and was allowed to copy the only portions\r\n     now preserved. In the last of Yorke's Letters from France\r\n     (Lond., 1814), thirty-three pages are given to Paine. Under\r\n     the name \"Little Corner of the World,\" Lady Smyth wrote\r\n     cheering letters to Paine in his prison, and he replied to\r\n     his then unknown correspondent under the name of \"The Castle\r\n     in die Air.\" After his release he discovered in his\r\n     correspondent a lady who had appealed to him for assistance,\r\n     no doubt for her husband. With Sir Robert (an English banker\r\n     in Paris) and Lady Smyth, Paine formed a fast friendship\r\n     which continued through life. Sir Robert was born in 1744,\r\n     and married (1776) a Miss Blake of Hanover Square, London.\r\n     He died in 1802 of illness brought on by his imprisonment\r\n     under Napoleon. Several of Paine's poems were addressed to\r\n     Lady Smyth.--_Editor._\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM \"THE CASTLE IN THE AIR,\" TO THE \"LITTLE CORNER OF THE WORLD.\"\r\n\r\nMemory, like a beauty that is always present to hear her-self\r\nflattered, is flattered by every one. But the absent and silent goddess,\r\nForgetfulness, has no votaries, and is never thought of: yet we owe her\r\nmuch. She is the goddess of ease, though not of pleasure.\r\n\r\nWhen the mind is like a room hung with black, and every corner of it\r\ncrowded with the most horrid images imagination can create, this kind\r\nspeechless goddess of a maid, Forgetfulness, is following us night\r\nand day with her opium wand, and gently touching first one, and then\r\nanother, benumbs them into rest, and at last glides them away with the\r\nsilence of a departing shadow. It is thus the tortured mind is restored\r\nto the calm condition of ease, and fitted for happiness.\r\n\r\nHow dismal must the picture of life appear to the mind in that dreadful\r\nmoment when it resolves on darkness, and to die! One can scarcely\r\nbelieve such a choice was possible. Yet how many of the young and\r\nbeautiful, timid in every thing else, and formed for delight, have shut\r\ntheir eyes upon the world, and made the waters their sepulchral bed! Ah,\r\nwould they in that crisis, when life and death are before them, and\r\neach within their reach, would they but think, or try to think, that\r\nForgetfulness will come to their relief, and lull them into ease, they\r\ncould stay their hand, and lay hold of life. But there is a necromancy\r\nin wretchedness that entombs the mind, and increases the misery, by\r\nshutting out every ray of light and hope. It makes the wretched\r\nfalsely believe they will be wretched ever. It is the most fatal of all\r\ndangerous delusions; and it is only when this necromantic night-mare of\r\nthe mind begins to vanish, by being resisted, that it is discovered to\r\nbe but a tyrannic spectre. All grief, like all things else, will yield\r\nto the obliterating power of time. While despair is preying on the mind,\r\ntime and its effects are preying on despair; and certain it is, the\r\ndismal vision will fade away, and Forgetfulness, with her sister Ease,\r\nwill change the scene. Then let not the wretched be rash, but wait,\r\npainful as the struggle may be, the arrival of Forgetfulness; for it\r\nwill certainly arrive.\r\n\r\nI have twice been present at the scene of attempted suicide. The one\r\na love-distracted girl in England, the other of a patriotic friend in\r\nFrance; and as the circumstances of each are strongly pictured in my\r\nmemory, I will relate them to you. They will in some measure corroborate\r\nwhat I have said of Forgetfulness.\r\n\r\nAbout the year 1766, I was in Lincolnshire, in England, and on a visit\r\nat the house of a widow lady, Mrs. E____, at a small village in the fens\r\nof that county. It was in summer; and one evening after supper, Mrs.\r\nE____ and myself went to take a turn in the garden. It was about eleven\r\no'clock, and to avoid the night air of the fens, we were walking in a\r\nbower, shaded over with hazel bushes. On a sudden, she screamed out,\r\nand cried \"Lord, look, look!\" I cast my eyes through the openings of the\r\nhazel bushes in the direction she was looking, and saw a white shapeless\r\nfigure, without head or arms, moving along one of the walks at some\r\ndistance from us. I quitted Mrs. E______, and went after it. When I got\r\ninto the walk where the figure was, and was following it, it took up\r\nanother walk. There was a holly bush in the corner of the two walks,\r\nwhich, it being night, I did not observe; and as I continued to step\r\nforward, the holly bush came in a straight line between me and the\r\nfigure, and I lost sight of it; and as I passed along one walk, and the\r\nfigure the other, the holly bush still continued to intercept the view,\r\nso as to give the appearance that the figure had vanished. When I came\r\nto the corner of the two walks, I caught sight of it again, and coming\r\nup with it, I reached out my hand to touch it; and in the act of doing\r\nthis, the idea struck me, will my hand pass through the air, or shall I\r\nfeel any thing? Less than a moment would decide this, and my hand rested\r\non the shoulder of a human figure. I spoke, but do not recollect what I\r\nsaid. It answered in a low voice, \"Pray let me alone.\" I then knew who\r\nit was. It was a young lady who was on a visit to Mrs. E------, and who,\r\nwhen we sat down to supper, said she found herself extremely ill, and\r\nwould go to bed. I called to Mrs. E------, who came, and I said to her,\r\n\"It is Miss N------.\" Mrs. E------ said, \"My God, I hope you are not\r\ngoing to do yourself any hurt;\" for Mrs. E------ suspected something.\r\nShe replied with pathetic melancholy, \"Life has not one pleasure for\r\nme.\" We got her into the house, and Mrs. E------ took her to sleep with\r\nher.\r\n\r\nThe case was, the man to whom she expected to be married had forsaken\r\nher, and when she heard he was to be married to another the shock\r\nappeared to her to be too great to be borne. She had retired, as I have\r\nsaid, to her room, and when she supposed all the family were gone to\r\nbed, (which would have been the case if Mrs. E------ and I had not\r\nwalked into the garden,) she undressed herself, and tied her apron over\r\nher head; which, descending below her waist, gave her the shapeless\r\nfigure I have spoken of. With this and a white under petticoat and\r\nslippers, for she had taken out her buckles and put them at the servant\r\nmaid's door, I suppose as a keepsake, and aided by the obscurity of\r\nalmost midnight, she came down stairs, and was going to drown her-self\r\nin a pond at the bottom of the garden, towards which she was going when\r\nMrs. E------screamed out. We found afterwards that she had heard the\r\nscream, and that was the cause of her changing her walk.\r\n\r\nBy gentle usage, and leading her into subjects that might, without\r\ndoing violence to her feelings, and without letting her see the direct\r\nintention of it, steal her as it were from the horror she was in, (and\r\nI felt a compassionate, earnest disposition to do it, for she was a good\r\ngirl,) she recovered her former cheerfulness, and was afterwards a happy\r\nwife, and the mother of a family.\r\n\r\nThe other case, and the conclusion in my next: In Paris, in 1793, had\r\nlodgings in the Rue Fauxbourg, St. Denis, No. 63.(1) They were the most\r\nagreeable, for situation, of any I ever had in Paris, except that they\r\nwere too remote from the Convention, of which I was then a member. But\r\nthis was recompensed by their being also remote from the alarms and\r\nconfusion into which the interior of Paris was then often thrown. The\r\nnews of those things used to arrive to us, as if we were in a state of\r\ntranquility in the country. The house, which was enclosed by a wall and\r\ngateway from the street, was a good deal like an old mansion farm house,\r\nand the court yard was like a farm-yard, stocked with fowls, ducks,\r\nturkies, and geese; which, for amusement, we used to feed out of the\r\nparlour window on the ground floor. There were some hutches for rabbits,\r\nand a sty with two pigs. Beyond, was a garden of more than an acre\r\nof ground, well laid out, and stocked with excellent fruit trees. The\r\norange, apricot, and green-gage plum, were the best I ever tasted;\r\nand it is the only place where I saw the wild cucumber. The place had\r\nformerly been occupied by some curious person.(2)\r\n\r\n     1 This ancient mansion is still standing (1895).--_Editor._\r\n\r\n     2 Madame de Pompadour, among others.--_Editor._»\r\n\r\nMy apartments consisted of three rooms; the first for wood, water, etc.,\r\nwith an old fashioned closet chest, high enough to hang up clothes in;\r\nthe next was the bed room; and beyond it the sitting room, which looked\r\ninto the garden through a glass door; and on the outside there was a\r\nsmall landing place railed in, and a flight of narrow stairs almost\r\nhidden by the vines that grew over it, by which I could descend into\r\nthe garden, without going down stairs through the house. I am trying\r\nby description to make you see the place in your mind, because it will\r\nassist the story I have to tell; and which I think you can do, because\r\nyou once called upon me there on account of Sir [Robert Smyth], who was\r\nthen, as I was soon afterwards, in arrestation. But it was winter when\r\nyou came, and it is a summer scene I am describing.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nI went into my chambers to write and sign a certificate for them, which\r\nI intended to take to the guard house to obtain their release. Just as I\r\nhad finished it a man came into my room dressed in the Parisian uniform\r\nof a captain, and spoke to me in good English, and with a good address.\r\nHe told me that two young men, Englishmen, were arrested and detained\r\nin the guard house, and that the section, (meaning those who represented\r\nand acted for the section,) had sent him to ask me if I knew them,\r\nin which case they would be liberated. This matter being soon settled\r\nbetween us, he talked to me about the Revolution, and something about\r\nthe \"Rights of Man,\" which he had read in English; and at parting\r\noffered me in a polite and civil manner, his services. And who do you\r\nthink the man was that offered me his services? It was no other than the\r\npublic executioner Samson, who guillotined the king, and all who were\r\nguillotined in Paris; and who lived in the same section, and in the same\r\nstreet with me.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nAs to myself, I used to find some relief by walking alone in the garden\r\nafter dark, and cursing with hearty good will the authors of that\r\nterrible system that had turned the character of the Revolution I had\r\nbeen proud to defend.\r\n\r\nI went but little to the Convention, and then only to make my\r\nappearance; because I found it impossible to join in their tremendous\r\ndecrees, and useless and dangerous to oppose them. My having voted and\r\nspoken extensively, more so than any other member, against the execution\r\nof the king, had already fixed a mark upon me: neither dared any of my\r\nassociates in the Convention to translate and speak in French for me\r\nanything I might have dared to have written.\r\n\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nPen and ink were then of no use to me: no good could be done by writing,\r\nand no printer dared to print; and whatever I might have written for\r\nmy private amusement, as anecdotes of the times, would have been\r\ncontinually exposed to be examined, and tortured into any meaning that\r\nthe rage of party might fix upon it; and as to softer subjects, my heart\r\nwas in distress at the fate of my friends, and my harp hung upon the\r\nweeping willows.(1)\r\n\r\nAs it was summer we spent most of our time in the garden, and passed it\r\naway in those childish amusements that serve to keep reflection from the\r\nmind, such as marbles, scotch-hops, battledores, etc., at which we were\r\nall pretty expert.\r\n\r\nIn this retired manner we remained about six or seven weeks, and our\r\nlandlord went every evening into the city to bring us the news of the\r\nday and the evening journal.\r\n\r\nI have now, my \"Little Corner of the World,\" led you on, step by step,\r\nto the scene that makes the sequel to this narrative, and I will put\r\nthat scene before your eyes. You shall see it in description as I saw it\r\nin fact.\r\n\r\n     1 This allusion is to the Girondins.--_Editor._,\r\n\r\n     2 Yorke omits the description \"from motives of personal\r\n     delicacy.\" The case was that of young Johnson, a wealthy\r\n     devotee of Paine in London, who had followed him to Paris\r\n     and lived in the same house with him. Hearing that Marat had\r\n     resolved on Paine's death, Johnson wrote a will bequeathing\r\n     his property to Paine, then stabbed himself, but recovered.\r\n     Paine was examined about this incident at Marat's trial.\r\n     (Moniteur, April 24, 1793.) See my \"Life of Paine,\" vol.\r\n     ii., p. 48 seq.--_Editor._.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nHe recovered, and being anxious to get out of France, a passage was\r\nobtained for him and Mr. Choppin: they received it late in the evening,\r\nand set off the next morning for Basle before four, from which place I\r\nhad a letter from them, highly pleased with their escape from France,\r\ninto which they had entered with an enthusiasm of patriotic devotion.\r\nAh, France! thou hast ruined the character of a Revolution virtuously\r\nbegun, and destroyed those who produced it. I might almost say like\r\nJob's servant, \"and I only am escaped.\"\r\n\r\nTwo days after they were gone I heard a rapping at the gate, and looking\r\nout of the window of the bed room I saw the landlord going with the\r\ncandle to the gate, which he opened, and a guard with musquets and fixed\r\nbayonets entered. I went to bed again, and made up my mind for prison,\r\nfor I was then the only lodger. It was a guard to take up [Johnson and\r\nChoppin], but, I thank God, they were out of their reach.\r\n\r\nThe guard came about a month after in the night, and took away the\r\nlandlord Georgeit; and the scene in the house finished with the\r\narrestation of myself. This was soon after you called on me, and sorry\r\nI was it was not in my power to render to [Sir Robert Smyth] the service\r\nthat you asked.\r\n\r\nI have now fulfilled my engagement, and I hope your expectation, in\r\nrelating the case of [Johnson], landed back on the shore of life, by\r\nthe mistake of the pilot who was conducting him out; and preserved\r\nafterwards from prison, perhaps a worse fate, without knowing it\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nYou say a story cannot be too melancholy for you. This is interesting\r\nand affecting, but not melancholy. It may raise in your mind a\r\nsympathetic sentiment in reading it; and though it may start a tear of\r\npity, you will not have a tear of sorrow to drop on the page.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nHere, my contemplative correspondent, let us stop and look back upon the\r\nscene. The matters here related being all facts, are strongly pictured\r\nin my mind, and in this sense Forgetfulness does not apply. But facts\r\nand feelings are distinct things, and it is against feelings that the\r\nopium wand of Forgetfulness draws us into ease. Look back on any scene\r\nor subject that once gave you distress, for all of us have felt some,\r\nand you will find, that though the remembrance of the fact is not\r\nextinct in your memory, the feeling is extinct in your mind. You can\r\nremember when you had felt distress, but you cannot feel that distress\r\nagain, and perhaps will wonder you felt it then. It is like a shadow\r\nthat loses itself by light.\r\n\r\nIt is often difficult to know what is a misfortune: that which we feel\r\nas a great one today, may be the means of turning aside our steps into\r\nsome new path that leads to happiness yet unknown. In tracing the scenes\r\nof my own life, I can discover that the condition I now enjoy, which is\r\nsweet to me, and will be more so when I get to America, except by the\r\nloss of your society, has been produced, in the first instance, in my\r\nbeing disappointed in former projects. Under that impenetrable veil,\r\nfuturity, we know not what is concealed, and the day to arrive is hidden\r\nfrom us. Turning then our thoughts to those cases of despair that lead\r\nto suicide, when, \"the mind,\" as you say, \"neither sees nor hears, and\r\nholds counsel only with itself; when the very idea of consolation would\r\nadd to the torture, and self-destruction is its only aim,\" what, it may\r\nbe asked, is the best advice, what the best relief? I answer, seek it\r\nnot in reason, for the mind is at war with reason, and to reason against\r\nfeelings is as vain as to reason against fire: it serves only to torture\r\nthe torture, by adding reproach to horror. All reasoning with ourselves\r\nin such cases acts upon us like the reason of another person, which,\r\nhowever kindly done, serves but to insult the misery we suffer. If\r\nreason could remove the pain, reason would have prevented it. If she\r\ncould not do the one, how is she to perform the other? In all such cases\r\nwe must look upon Reason as dispossessed of her empire, by a revolt\r\nof the mind. She retires herself to a distance to weep, and the ebony\r\nsceptre of Despair rules alone. All that Reason can do is to suggest,\r\nto hint a thought, to signify a wish, to cast now and then a kind\r\nof bewailing look, to hold up, when she can catch the eye, the\r\nminiature-shaded portrait of Hope; and though dethroned, and can dictate\r\nno more, to wait upon us in the humble station of a handmaid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVIII. AGRARIAN JUSTICE.\r\n\r\nEditor's introduction:\r\n\r\nThis pamphlet appeared first in Paris, 1797, with the title: \"Thomas\r\nPayne à La Législature et au Directoire. Ou la Justice Agraire opposée à\r\nla Loi Agraire, et aux privilèges agraires. Prix 15 sols. À Paris, chez\r\nla citoyenne Ragouleau, près le Théâtre de la République, No. 229. Et\r\nchez les Marchands de Nouveautés.\" A prefatory note says (translated):\r\n\"The sudden departure of Thomas Paine has pre-vented his supervising the\r\ntranslation of this work, to which he attached great value. He entrusted\r\nit to a friend. It is for the reader to decide whether the scheme here\r\nset forth is worthy of the publicity given it.\" (Paine had gone to Havre\r\nearly in May with the Monroes, intending to accompany them to America,\r\nbut, rightly suspecting plans for his capture by an English cruiser,\r\nreturned to Paris.) In the same year the pamphlet was printed in\r\nEnglish, by W. Adlard in Paris, and in London for \"T. Williams, No.\r\n8 Little Turnstile, Holborn.\" Paine's preface to the London edition\r\ncontained some sentences which the publishers, as will be seen,\r\nsuppressed under asterisks, and two sentences were omitted from the\r\npamphlet which I have supplied from the French. The English title adds a\r\nbrief resume of Paine's scheme to the caption--\"Agrarian Justice opposed\r\nto Agrarian Law, and to Agrarian Monopoly.\" The work was written in the\r\nwinter of 1795-6, when Paine was still an invalid in Monroe's house,\r\nthough not published until 1797.\r\n\r\nThe prefatory Letter to the Legislature and the Directory, now for the\r\nfirst time printed in English, is of much historical interest, and shows\r\nthe title of the pamphlet related to the rise of Socialism in France.\r\nThe leader of that move-ment, François Noel Babeuf, a frantic and\r\npathetic figure of the time, had just been executed. He had named\r\nhimself \"Gracchus,\" and called his journal \"Tribune du Peuple,\" in\r\nhomage to the Roman Tribune, Caius Gracchus, the original socialist and\r\nagrarian, whose fate (suicide of himself and his servant) Babeuf and his\r\ndisciple Darthé invoked in prison, whence they were carried bleeding to\r\nthe guillotine. This, however, was on account of the conspiracy they had\r\nformed, with the remains of the Robespierrian party and some disguised\r\nroyalists, to overthrow the government. The socialistic propaganda of\r\nBabeuf, however, prevailed over all other elements of the conspiracy:\r\nthe reactionary features of the Constitution, especially the property\r\nqualification of suffrage of whose effects Paine had warned the\r\nConvention in the speech printed in this volume, (chapter xxv.) and the\r\npoverty which survived a revolution that promised its abolition, had\r\nexcited wide discontent. The \"Babouvists\" numbered as many as 17,000 in\r\nParis. Babeuf and Lepelletier were appointed by the secret council of\r\nthis fraternity (which took the name of \"Equals\") a \"Directory of Public\r\nSafety.\" May 11, 1796, was fixed for seizing on the government, and\r\nBabeuf had prepared his Proclamation of the socialistic millennium. But\r\nthe plot was discovered, May 10th, the leaders arrested, and, after\r\na year's delay, two of them executed,--the best-hearted men in the\r\nmovement, Babeuf and Darthé. Paine too had been moved by the cry for\r\n\"Bread, and the Constitution of '93 \"; and it is a notable coincidence\r\nthat in that winter of 1795-6, while the socialists were secretly\r\nplotting to seize the kingdom of heaven by violence, Paine was devising\r\nhis plan of relief by taxing inheritances of land, anticipating by a\r\nhundred years the English budget of Sir William Harcourt. Babeuf having\r\nfailed in his socialist, and Pichegru in his royalist, plot, their blows\r\nwere yet fatal: there still remained in the hearts of millions a Babeuf\r\nor a Pichegru awaiting the chieftain strong enough to combine them,\r\nas Napoleon presently did, making all the nation \"Égaux\" as parts of a\r\nmighty military engine, and satisfying the royalist triflers with the\r\npomp and glory of war.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAUTHOR'S INSCRIPTION.\r\n\r\nTo the Legislature and the Executive Directory of the French Republic.\r\n\r\nThe plan contained in this work is not adapted for any particular\r\ncountry alone: the principle on which it is based is general. But as the\r\nrights of man are a new study in this world, and one needing protection\r\nfrom priestly imposture, and the insolence of oppressions too long\r\nestablished, I have thought it right to place this little work under\r\nyour safeguard. When we reflect on the long and dense night in which\r\nFrance and all Europe have remained plunged by their governments and\r\ntheir priests, we must feel less surprise than grief at the bewilderment\r\ncaused by the first burst of light that dispels the darkness. The eye\r\naccustomed to darkness can hardly bear at first the broad daylight. It\r\nis by usage the eye learns to see, and it is the same in passing from\r\nany situation to its opposite.\r\n\r\nAs we have not at one instant renounced all our errors, we cannot at one\r\nstroke acquire knowledge of all our rights. France has had the honour of\r\nadding to the word _Liberty_ that of _Equality_; and this word signifies\r\nessentially a principal that admits of no gradation in the things to\r\nwhich it applies. But equality is often misunderstood, often misapplied,\r\nand often violated.\r\n\r\n_Liberty_ and _Property_ are words expressing all those of our\r\npossessions which are not of an intellectual nature. There are two kinds\r\nof property. Firstly, natural property, or that which comes to us from\r\nthe Creator of the universe,--such as the earth, air, water. Secondly,\r\nartificial or acquired property,--the invention of men. In the latter\r\nequality is impossible; for to distribute it equally it would be\r\nnecessary that all should have contributed in the same proportion, which\r\ncan never be the case; and this being the case, every individual would\r\nhold on to his own property, as his right share. Equality of natural\r\nproperty is the subject of this little essay. Every individual in\r\nthe world is born therein with legitimate claims on a certain kind of\r\nproperty, or its equivalent.\r\n\r\nThe right of voting for persons charged with the execution of the laws\r\nthat govern society is inherent in the word Liberty, and constitutes\r\nthe equality of personal rights. But even if that right (of voting) were\r\ninherent in property, which I deny, the right of suffrage would still\r\nbelong to all equally, because, as I have said, all individuals have\r\nlegitimate birthrights in a certain species of property.\r\n\r\nI have always considered the present Constitution of the French Republic\r\nthe _best organized system_ the human mind has yet produced. But I hope\r\nmy former colleagues will not be offended if I warn them of an error\r\nwhich has slipped into its principle. Equality of the right of suffrage\r\nis not maintained. This right is in it connected with a condition on\r\nwhich it ought not to depend; that is, with a proportion of a certain\r\ntax called \"direct.\" The dignity of suffrage is thus lowered; and, in\r\nplacing it in the scale with an inferior thing, the enthusiasm that\r\nright is capable of inspiring is diminished. It is impossible to find\r\nany equivalent counterpoise for the right of suffrage, because it is\r\nalone worthy to be its own basis, and cannot thrive as a graft, or an\r\nappendage.\r\n\r\nSince the Constitution was established we have seen two conspiracies\r\nstranded,--that of Babeuf, and that of some obscure personages who\r\ndecorate themselves with the despicable name of \"royalists.\" The defect\r\nin principle of the Constitution was the origin of Babeuf's conspiracy.\r\nHe availed himself of the resentment caused by this flaw, and instead\r\nof seeking a remedy by legitimate and constitutional means, or proposing\r\nsome measure useful to society, the conspirators did their best to renew\r\ndisorder and confusion, and constituted themselves personally into a\r\nDirectory, which is formally destructive of election and representation.\r\nThey were, in fine, extravagant enough to suppose that society, occupied\r\nwith its domestic affairs, would blindly yield to them a directorship\r\nusurped by violence.\r\n\r\nThe conspiracy of Babeuf was followed in a few months by that of the\r\nroyalists, who foolishly flattered themselves with the notion of\r\ndoing great things by feeble or foul means. They counted on all the\r\ndiscontented, from whatever cause, and tried to rouse, in their turn,\r\nthe class of people who had been following the others. But these new\r\nchiefs acted as if they thought society had nothing more at heart\r\nthan to maintain courtiers, pensioners, and all their train, under the\r\ncontemptible title of royalty. My little essay will disabuse them, by\r\nshowing that society is aiming at a very different end,--maintaining\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nWe all know or should know, that the time during which a revolution is\r\nproceeding is not the time when its resulting advantages can be\r\nenjoyed. But had Babeuf and his accomplices taken into consideration the\r\ncondition of France under this constitution, and compared it with what\r\nit was under the tragical revolutionary government, and during the\r\nexecrable reign of Terror, the rapidity of the alteration must have\r\nappeared to them very striking and astonishing. Famine has been replaced\r\nby abundance, and by the well-founded hope of a near and increasing\r\nprosperity.\r\n\r\nAs for the defect in the Constitution, I am fully convinced that it will\r\nbe rectified constitutionally, and that this step is indispensable; for\r\nso long as it continues it will inspire the hopes and furnish the means\r\nof conspirators; and for the rest, it is regrettable that a Constitution\r\nso wisely organized should err so much in its principle. This fault\r\nexposes it to other dangers which will make themselves felt. Intriguing\r\ncandidates will go about among those who have not the means to pay the\r\ndirect tax and pay it for them, on condition of receiving their votes.\r\nLet us maintain inviolably equality in the sacred right of suffrage:\r\npublic security can never have a basis more solid. Salut et Fraternité.\r\n\r\nYour former colleague,\r\n\r\nThomas Paine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAUTHOR'S ENGLISH PREFACE.\r\n\r\nThe following little Piece was written in the winter of 1795 and 96;\r\nand, as I had not determined whether to publish it during the present\r\nwar, or to wait till the commencement of a peace, it has lain by me,\r\nwithout alteration or addition, from the time it was written.\r\n\r\nWhat has determined me to publish it now is, a sermon preached by\r\nWatson, _Bishop of Llandaff_. Some of my Readers will recollect, that\r\nthis Bishop wrote a Book entitled _An Apology for the Bible_ in answer\r\nto my _Second Part of the Age of Reason_. I procured a copy of his Book,\r\nand he may depend upon hearing from me on that subject.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the Bishop's Book is a List of the Works he has written.\r\nAmong which is the sermon alluded to; it is entitled: \"The Wisdom and\r\nGoodness of God, in having made both Rich and Poor; with an Appendix,\r\ncontaining Reflections on the Present State of England and France.\"\r\n\r\nThe error contained in this sermon determined me to publish my Agrarian\r\nJustice. It is wrong to say God made _rich and poor_; he made only _male\r\nand female_; and he gave them the earth for their inheritance. '...\r\n\r\nInstead of preaching to encourage one part of mankind in insolence... it\r\nwould be better that Priests employed their time to render the general\r\ncondition of man less miserable than it is. Practical religion consists\r\nin doing good: and the only way of serving God is, that of endeavouring\r\nto make his creation happy. All preaching that has not this for its\r\nobject is nonsense and hypocracy.\r\n\r\n     1 The omissions are noted in the English edition of 1797.--\r\n     _Editor._.\r\n\r\nTo preserve the benefits of what is called civilized life, and to remedy\r\nat the same time the evil which it has produced, ought to be considered\r\nas one of the first objects of reformed legislation.\r\n\r\nWhether that state that is proudly, perhaps erroneously, called\r\ncivilization, has most promoted or most injured the general happiness\r\nof man, is a question that may be strongly contested. On one side,\r\nthe spectator is dazzled by splendid appearances; on the other, he is\r\nshocked by extremes of wretchedness; both of which it has erected. The\r\nmost affluent and the most miserable of the human race are to be found\r\nin the countries that are called civilized.\r\n\r\nTo understand what the state of society ought to be, it is necessary to\r\nhave some idea of the natural and primitive state of man; such as it is\r\nat this day among the Indians of North America. There is not, in that\r\nstate, any of those spectacles of human misery which poverty and want\r\npresent to our eyes in all the towns and streets in Europe. Poverty,\r\ntherefore, is a thing created by that which is called civilized life. It\r\nexists not in the natural state. On the other hand, the natural state is\r\nwithout those advantages which flow from agriculture, arts, science, and\r\nmanufactures.\r\n\r\nThe life of an Indian is a continual holiday, compared with the poor of\r\nEurope; and, on the other hand it appears to be abject when compared\r\nto the rich. Civilization, therefore, or that which is so called, has\r\noperated two ways: to make one part of society more affluent, and the\r\nother more wretched, than would have been the lot of either in a natural\r\nstate.\r\n\r\nIt is always possible to go from the natural to the civilized state, but\r\nit is never possible to go from the civilized to the natural state. The\r\nreason is, that man in a natural state, subsisting by hunting, requires\r\nten times the quantity of land to range over to procure himself\r\nsustenance, than would support him in a civilized state, where the\r\nearth is cultivated. When, therefore, a country becomes populous by the\r\nadditional aids of cultivation, art, and science, there is a necessity\r\nof preserving things in that state; because without it there cannot be\r\nsustenance for more, perhaps, than a tenth part of its inhabitants. The\r\nthing, therefore, now to be done is to remedy the evils and preserve the\r\nbenefits that have arisen to society by passing from the natural to that\r\nwhich is called the civilized state.\r\n\r\nIn taking the matter upon this ground, the first principle of\r\ncivilization ought to have been, and ought still to be, that the\r\ncondition of every person born into the world, after a state of\r\ncivilization commences, ought not to be worse than if he had been born\r\nbefore that period. But the fact is, that the condition of millions, in\r\nevery country in Europe, is far worse than if they had been born before\r\ncivilization began, or had been born among the Indians of North America\r\nat the present day. I will shew how this fact has happened.\r\n\r\nIt is a position not to be controverted that the earth, in its natural\r\nuncultivated state was, and ever would have continued to be, _the common\r\nproperty of the human race_. In that state every man would have been\r\nborn to property. He would have been a joint life proprietor with the\r\nrest in the property of the soil, and in all its natural productions,\r\nvegetable and animal.\r\n\r\nBut the earth in its natural state, as before said, is capable of\r\nsupporting but a small number of inhabitants compared with what it\r\nis capable of doing in a cultivated state. And as it is impossible to\r\nseparate the improvement made by cultivation from the earth itself, upon\r\nwhich that improvement is made, the idea of landed property arose from\r\nthat inseparable connection; but it is nevertheless true, that it is\r\nthe value of the improvement only, and not the earth itself, that is\r\nindividual property. Every proprietor, therefore, of cultivated land,\r\nowes to the community a _ground-rent_ (for I know of no better term\r\nto express the idea) for the land which he holds; and it is from this\r\nground-rent that the fund proposed in this plan is to issue.\r\n\r\nIt is deducible, as well from the nature of the thing as from all the\r\nhistories transmitted to us, that the idea of landed property commenced\r\nwith cultivation, and that there was no such thing as landed property\r\nbefore that time. It could not exist in the first state of man, that\r\nof hunters. It did not exist in the second state, that of shepherds:\r\nneither Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, nor Job, so far as the history of the\r\nBible may be credited in probable things, were owners of land. Their\r\nproperty consisted, as is always enumerated, in flocks and herds, and\r\nthey travelled with them from place to place. The frequent contentions\r\nat that time, about the use of a well in the dry country of Arabia,\r\nwhere those people lived, also shew that there was no landed property.\r\nIt was not admitted that land could be claimed as property.\r\n\r\nThere could be no such thing as landed property originally. Man did not\r\nmake the earth, and, though he had a natural right to occupy it, he had\r\nno right to locate as his property in perpetuity any part of it; neither\r\ndid the creator of the earth open a land-office, from whence the\r\nfirst title-deeds should issue. Whence then, arose the idea of landed\r\nproperty? I answer as before, that when cultivation began the idea of\r\nlanded property began with it, from the impossibility of separating the\r\nimprovement made by cultivation from the earth itself, upon which that\r\nimprovement was made. The value of the improvement so far exceeded the\r\nvalue of the natural earth, at that time, as to absorb it; till, in the\r\nend, the common right of all became confounded into the cultivated right\r\nof the individual. But there are, nevertheless, distinct species of\r\nrights, and will continue to be so long as the earth endures.\r\n\r\nIt is only by tracing things to their origin that we can gain rightful\r\nideas of them, and it is by gaining such ideas that we discover the\r\nboundary that divides right from wrong, and teaches every man to know\r\nhis own. I have entitled this tract Agrarian Justice, to distinguish it\r\nfrom Agrarian Law. Nothing could be more unjust than Agrarian Law in a\r\ncountry improved by cultivation; for though every man, as an inhabitant\r\nof the earth, is a joint proprietor of it in its natural state, it\r\ndoes not follow that he is a joint proprietor of cultivated earth. The\r\nadditional value made by cultivation, after the system was admitted,\r\nbecame the property of those who did it, or who inherited it from them,\r\nor who purchased it. It had originally no owner. Whilst, therefore, I\r\nadvocate the right, and interest myself in the hard case of all\r\nthose who have been thrown out of their natural inheritance by the\r\nintroduction of the system of landed property, I equally defend the\r\nright of the possessor to the part which is his.\r\n\r\nCultivation is at least one of the greatest natural improvements ever\r\nmade by human invention. It has given to created earth a tenfold value.\r\nBut the landed monopoly that began with it has produced the greatest\r\nevil. It has dispossessed more than half the inhabitants of every nation\r\nof their natural inheritance, without providing for them, as ought\r\nto have been done, an indemnification for that loss, and has thereby\r\ncreated a species of poverty and wretchedness that did not exist before.\r\n\r\nIn advocating the case of the persons thus dispossessed, it is a right,\r\nand not a charity, that I am pleading for. But it is that kind of right\r\nwhich, being neglected at first, could not be brought forward afterwards\r\ntill heaven had opened the way by a revolution in the system of\r\ngovernment. Let us then do honour to revolutions by justice, and give\r\ncurrency to their principles by blessings.\r\n\r\nHaving thus in a few words, opened the merits of the case, I shall now\r\nproceed to the plan I have to propose, which is,\r\n\r\nTo create a National Fund, out of which there shall be paid to every\r\nperson, when arrived at the age of twenty-one years, the sum of fifteen\r\npounds sterling, as a compensation in part, for the loss of his or\r\nher natural inheritance, by the introduction of the system of landed\r\nproperty:\r\n\r\nAnd also, the sum of ten pounds per annum, during life, to every person\r\nnow living, of the age of fifty years, and to all others as they shall\r\narrive at that age.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMEANS BY WHICH THE FUND IS TO BE CREATED.\r\n\r\nI have already established the principle, namely, that the earth, in its\r\nnatural uncultivated state was, and ever would have continued to be, the\r\n_common property of the human race_; that in that state, every person\r\nwould have been born to property; and that the system of landed\r\nproperty, by its inseparable connection with cultivation, and with what\r\nis called civilized life, has absorbed the property of all those whom\r\nit dispossessed, without providing, as ought to have been done, an\r\nindemnification for that loss.\r\n\r\nThe fault, however, is not in the present possessors. No complaint is\r\nintended, or ought to be alleged against them, unless they adopt the\r\ncrime by opposing justice. The fault is in the system, and it has stolen\r\nimperceptibly upon the world, aided afterwards by the agrarian law of\r\nthe sword. But the fault can be made to reform itself by successive\r\ngenerations; and without diminishing or deranging the property of any of\r\nthe present possessors, the operation of the fund can yet commence, and\r\nbe in full activity, the first year of its establishment, or soon after,\r\nas I shall shew.\r\n\r\nIt is proposed that the payments, as already stated, be made to every\r\nperson, rich or poor. It is best to make it so, to prevent invidious\r\ndistinctions. It is also right it should be so, because it is in lieu of\r\nthe natural inheritance, which, as a right, belongs to every man, over\r\nand above the property he may have created, or inherited from those who\r\ndid. Such persons as do not choose to receive it can throw it into the\r\ncommon fund.\r\n\r\nTaking it then for granted that no person ought to be in a worse\r\ncondition when born under what is called a state of civilization, than\r\nhe would have been had he been born in a state of nature, and that\r\ncivilization ought to have made, and ought still to make, provision for\r\nthat purpose, it can only be done by subtracting from property a portion\r\nequal in value to the natural inheritance it has absorbed.\r\n\r\nVarious methods may be proposed for this purpose, but that which appears\r\nto be the best (not only because it will operate without deranging any\r\npresent possessors, or without interfering with the collection of taxes\r\nor emprunts necessary for the purposes of government and the revolution,\r\nbut because it will be the least troublesome and the most effectual, and\r\nalso because the subtraction will be made at a time that best admits it)\r\nis at the moment that.. property is passing by the death of one person\r\nto the possession of another. In this case, the bequeather gives\r\nnothing: the receiver pays nothing. The only matter to him is, that\r\nthe monopoly of natural inheritance, to which there never was a right,\r\nbegins to cease in his person. A generous man would not wish it to\r\ncontinue, and a just man will rejoice to see it abolished.\r\n\r\nMy state of health prevents my making sufficient inquiries with respect\r\nto the doctrine of probabilities, whereon to found calculations with\r\nsuch degrees of certainty as they are capable of. What, therefore, I\r\noffer on this head is more the result of observation and reflection\r\nthan of received information; but I believe it will be found to agree\r\nsufficiently with fact.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, taking twenty-one years as the epoch of maturity,\r\nall the property of a nation, real and personal, is always in the\r\npossession of persons above that age. It is then necessary to know, as a\r\ndatum of calculation, the average of years which persons above that age\r\nwill live. I take this average to be about thirty years, for though\r\nmany persons will live forty, fifty, or sixty years after the age of\r\ntwenty-one years, others will die much sooner, and some in every year of\r\nthat time.\r\n\r\nTaking, then, thirty years as the average of time, it will give, without\r\nany material variation one way or other, the average of time in which\r\nthe whole property or capital of a nation, or a sum equal thereto, will\r\nhave passed through one entire revolution in descent, that is, will have\r\ngone by deaths to new possessors; for though, in many instances, some\r\nparts of this capital will remain forty, fifty, or sixty years in the\r\npossession of one person, other parts will have revolved two or three\r\ntimes before those thirty years expire, which will bring it to that\r\naverage; for were one half the capital of a nation to revolve twice in\r\nthirty years, it would produce the same fund as if the whole revolved\r\nonce.\r\n\r\nTaking, then, thirty years as the average of time in which the whole\r\ncapital of a nation, or a sum equal thereto, will revolve once, the\r\nthirtieth part thereof will be the sum that will revolve every year,\r\nthat is, will go by deaths to new possessors; and this last sum being\r\nthus known, and the ratio per cent, to be subtracted from it determined,\r\nit will give the annual amount or income of the proposed fund, to be\r\napplied as already mentioned.\r\n\r\nIn looking over the discourse of the English minister, Pitt, in his\r\nopening of what is called in England the budget, (the scheme of finance\r\nfor the year 1796,) I find an estimate of the national capital of that\r\ncountry. As this estimate of a national capital is prepared ready to my\r\nhand, I take it as a datum to act upon. When a calculation is made upon\r\nthe known capital of any nation, combined with its population, it will\r\nserve as a scale for any other nation, in proportion as its capital and\r\npopulation be more or less. I am the more disposed to take this estimate\r\nof Mr. Pitt, for the purpose of showing to that minister, upon his own\r\ncalculation, how much better money may be employed than in wasting it,\r\nas he has done, on the wild project of setting up Bourbon kings. What,\r\nin the name of heaven, are Bourbon kings to the people of England? It is\r\nbetter that the people have bread.\r\n\r\nMr. Pitt states the national capital of England, real and personal,\r\nto be one thousand three hundred millions sterling, which is about\r\none-fourth part of the national capital of France, including Belgia. The\r\nevent of the last harvest in each country proves that the soil of France\r\nis more productive than that of England, and that it can better support\r\ntwenty-four or twenty-five millions of inhabitants than that of England\r\ncan seven or seven and a half millions.\r\n\r\nThe thirtieth part of this capital of 1,300,000,000L. is 43,333,333L.\r\nwhich is the part that will revolve every year by deaths in that country\r\nto new possessors; and the sum that will annually revolve in France\r\nin the proportion of four to one, will be about one hundred and\r\nseventy-three millions sterling. From this sum of 43,333,333L. annually\r\nrevolving, is to be subtracted the value of the natural inheritance\r\nabsorbed in it, which, perhaps, in fair justice, cannot be taken at\r\nless, and ought not to be taken for more, than a tenth part.\r\n\r\nIt will always happen, that of the property thus revolving by deaths\r\nevery year a part will descend in a direct line to sons and daughters,\r\nand the other part collaterally, and the proportion will be found to be\r\nabout three to one; that is, about thirty millions of the above sum will\r\ndescend to direct heirs, and the remaining sum of 13,333,333L. to more\r\ndistant relations, and in part to strangers.\r\n\r\nConsidering, then, that man is always related to society, that\r\nrelationship will become comparatively greater in proportion as the next\r\nof kin is more distant, it is therefore consistent with civilization to\r\nsay that where there are no direct heirs society shall be heir to a part\r\nover and above the tenth part due to society. If this additional part be\r\nfrom five to ten or twelve per cent., in proportion as the next of kin\r\nbe nearer or more remote, so as to average with the escheats that may\r\nfall, which ought always to go to society and not to the government\r\n(an addition of ten per cent, more), the produce from the annual sum of\r\n43,333,333L. will be:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: table361]\r\n\r\nHaving thus arrived at the annual amount of the proposed fund, I come,\r\nin the next place, to speak of the population proportioned to this fund,\r\nand to compare it with the uses to which the fund is to be applied.\r\n\r\nThe population (I mean that of England) does not exceed seven millions\r\nand a half, and the number of persons above the age of fifty will in\r\nthat case be about four hundred thousand. There would not, however, be\r\nmore than that number that would accept the proposed ten pounds sterling\r\nper annum, though they would be entitled to it. I have no idea it would\r\nbe accepted by many persons who had a yearly income of two or three\r\nhundred pounds sterling. But as we often see instances of rich people\r\nfalling into sudden poverty, even at the age of sixty, they would always\r\nhave the right of drawing all the arrears due to them. Four millions,\r\ntherefore, of the above annual sum of 5,666,6667L. will be required for\r\nfour hundred thousand aged persons, at ten pounds sterling each.\r\n\r\nI come now to speak of the persons annually arriving at twenty-one years\r\nof age. If all the persons who died were above the age of twenty-one\r\nyears, the number of persons annually arriving at that age, must be\r\nequal to the annual number of deaths, to keep the population stationary.\r\nBut the greater part die under the age of twenty-one, and therefore the\r\nnumber of persons annually arriving at twenty-one will be less than half\r\nthe number of deaths. The whole number of deaths upon a population of\r\nseven millions and an half will be about 220,000 annually. The number\r\narriving at twenty-one years of age will be about 100,000. The whole\r\nnumber of these will not receive the proposed fifteen pounds, for the\r\nreasons already mentioned, though, as in the former case, they would be\r\nentitled to it. Admitting then that a tenth part declined receiving it,\r\nthe amount would stand thus:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: table362]\r\n\r\nThere are, in every country, a number of blind and lame persons, totally\r\nincapable of earning a livelihood. But as it will always happen that the\r\ngreater number of blind persons will be among those who are above\r\nthe age of fifty years, they will be provided for in that class. The\r\nremaining sum of 316,666L. will provide for the lame and blind under\r\nthat age, at the same rate of 10L. annually for each person.\r\n\r\nHaving now gone through all the necessary calculations, and stated the\r\nparticulars of the plan, I shall conclude with some observations.\r\n\r\nIt is not charity but a right, not bounty but justice, that I am\r\npleading for. The present state of civilization is as odious as it is\r\nunjust. It is absolutely the opposite of what it should be, and it is\r\nnecessary that a revolution should be made in it.(1) The contrast of\r\naffluence and wretchedness continually meeting and offending the eye,\r\nis like dead and living bodies chained together. Though I care as little\r\nabout riches, as any man, I am a friend to riches because they are\r\ncapable of good. I care not how affluent some may be, provided that\r\nnone be miserable in consequence of it. But it is impossible to enjoy\r\naffluence with the felicity it is capable of being enjoyed, whilst so\r\nmuch misery is mingled in the scene. The sight of the misery, and the\r\nunpleasant sensations it suggests, which, though they may be suffocated\r\ncannot be extinguished, are a greater drawback upon the felicity of\r\naffluence than the proposed 10 per cent, upon property is worth. He that\r\nwould not give the one to get rid of the other has no charity, even for\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n     1 This and the preceding sentence axe omitted in all\r\n     previous English and American editions.--_Editor._.\r\n\r\nThere are, in every country, some magnificent charities established by\r\nindividuals. It is, however, but little that any individual can do,\r\nwhen the whole extent of the misery to be relieved is considered. He may\r\nsatisfy his conscience, but not his heart. He may give all that he\r\nhas, and that all will relieve but little. It is only by organizing\r\ncivilization upon such principles as to act like a system of pullies,\r\nthat the whole weight of misery can be removed.\r\n\r\nThe plan here proposed will reach the whole. It will immediately relieve\r\nand take out of view three classes of wretchedness--the blind, the lame,\r\nand the aged poor; and it will furnish the rising generation with means\r\nto prevent their becoming poor; and it will do this without deranging\r\nor interfering with any national measures. To shew that this will be the\r\ncase, it is sufficient to observe that the operation and effect of\r\nthe plan will, in all cases, be the same as if every individual were\r\n_voluntarily_ to make his will and dispose of his property in the manner\r\nhere proposed.\r\n\r\nBut it is justice, and not charity, that is the principle of the plan.\r\nIn all great cases it is necessary to have a principle more universally\r\nactive than charity; and, with respect to justice, it ought not to be\r\nleft to the choice of detached individuals whether they will do justice\r\nor not. Considering then, the plan on the ground of justice, it ought to\r\nbe the act of the whole, growing spontaneously out of the principles of\r\nthe revolution, and the reputation of it ought to be national and not\r\nindividual.\r\n\r\nA plan upon this principle would benefit the revolution by the energy\r\nthat springs from the consciousness of justice. It would multiply also\r\nthe national resources; for property, like vegetation, increases\r\nby offsets. When a young couple begin the world, the difference is\r\nexceedingly great whether they begin with nothing or with fifteen pounds\r\napiece. With this aid they could buy a cow, and implements to cultivate\r\na few acres of land; and instead of becoming burdens upon society, which\r\nis always the case where children are produced faster than they can be\r\nfed, would be put in the way of becoming useful and profitable citizens.\r\nThe national domains also would sell the better if pecuniary aids were\r\nprovided to cultivate them in small lots.\r\n\r\nIt is the practice of what has unjustly obtained the name of\r\ncivilization (and the practice merits not to be called either charity\r\nor policy) to make some provision for persons becoming poor and wretched\r\nonly at the time they become so. Would it not, even as a matter of\r\neconomy, be far better to adopt means to prevent their becoming poor?\r\nThis can best be done by making every person when arrived at the age\r\nof twenty-one years an inheritor of something to begin with. The rugged\r\nface of society, chequered with the extremes of affluence and want,\r\nproves that some extraordinary violence has been committed upon it,\r\nand calls on justice for redress. The great mass of the poor in all\r\ncountries are become an hereditary race, and it is next to impossible\r\nfor them to get cut of that state of themselves. It ought also to be\r\nobserved that this mass increases in all countries that are called\r\ncivilized. More persons fall annually into it than get out of it.\r\n\r\nThough in a plan of which justice and humanity are the\r\nfoundation-principles, interest ought not to be admitted into the\r\ncalculation, yet it is always of advantage to the establishment of any\r\nplan to shew that it is beneficial as a matter of interest. The success\r\nof any proposed plan submitted to public consideration must finally\r\ndepend on the numbers interested in supporting it, united with the\r\njustice of its principles.\r\n\r\nThe plan here proposed will benefit all, without injuring any. It will\r\nconsolidate the interest of the Republic with that of the individual.\r\nTo the numerous class dispossessed of their natural inheritance by the\r\nsystem of landed property it will be an act of national justice. To\r\npersons dying possessed of moderate fortunes it will operate as a\r\ntontine to their children, more beneficial than the sum of money paid\r\ninto the fund: and it will give to the accumulation of riches a degree\r\nof security that none of the old governments of Europe, now tottering on\r\ntheir foundations, can give.\r\n\r\nI do not suppose that more than one family in ten, in any of the\r\ncountries of Europe, has, when the head of the family dies, a clear\r\nproperty left of five hundred pounds sterling. To all such the plan is\r\nadvantageous. That property would pay fifty pounds into the fund, and if\r\nthere were only two children under age they would receive fifteen pounds\r\neach, (thirty pounds,) on coming of age, and be entitled to ten pounds\r\na-year after fifty. It is from the overgrown acquisition of property\r\nthat the fund will support itself; and I know that the possessors of\r\nsuch property in England, though they would eventually be benefited by\r\nthe protection of nine-tenths of it, will exclaim against the plan. But\r\nwithout entering into any inquiry how they came by that property, let\r\nthem recollect that they have been the advocates of this war, and that\r\nMr. Pitt has already laid on more new taxes to be raised annually upon\r\nthe people of England, and that for supporting the despotism of Austria\r\nand the Bourbons against the liberties of France, than would pay\r\nannually all the sums proposed in this plan.\r\n\r\nI have made the calculations stated in this plan, upon what is called\r\npersonal, as well as upon landed property. The reason for making it upon\r\nland is already explained; and the reason for taking personal property\r\ninto the calculation is equally well founded though on a different\r\nprinciple. Land, as before said, is the free gift of the Creator in\r\ncommon to the human race. Personal property is the effect of society;\r\nand it is as impossible for an individual to acquire personal property\r\nwithout the aid of society, as it is for him to make land originally.\r\nSeparate an individual from society, and give him an island or a\r\ncontinent to possess, and he cannot acquire personal property. He cannot\r\nbe rich. So inseparably are the means connected with the end, in all\r\ncases, that where the former do not exist the latter cannot be obtained.\r\nAll accumulation, therefore, of personal property, beyond what a man's\r\nown hands produce, is derived to him by living in society; and he owes\r\non every principle of justice, of gratitude, and of civilization, a part\r\nof that accumulation back again to society from whence the whole came.\r\nThis is putting the matter on a general principle, and perhaps it is\r\nbest to do so; for if we examine the case minutely it will be found that\r\nthe accumulation of personal property is, in many instances, the effect\r\nof paying too little for the labour that produced it; the consequence\r\nof which is, that the working hand perishes in old age, and the employer\r\nabounds in affluence. It is, perhaps, impossible to proportion exactly\r\nthe price of labour to the profits it produces; and it will also be\r\nsaid, as an apology for the injustice, that were a workman to receive\r\nan increase of wages daily he would not save it against old age, nor be\r\nmuch bet-ter for it in the interim. Make, then, society the treasurer to\r\nguard it for him in a common fund; for it is no reason, that because he\r\nmight not make a good use of it for himself, another should take it.\r\n\r\nThe state of civilization that has prevailed throughout Europe, is as\r\nunjust in its principle, as it is horrid in its effects; and it is the\r\nconsciousness of this, and the apprehension that such a state cannot\r\ncontinue when once investigation begins in any country, that makes\r\nthe possessors of property dread every idea of a revolution. It is the\r\nhazard and not the principle of revolutions that retards their progress.\r\nThis being the case, it is necessary as well for the protection of\r\nproperty, as for the sake of justice and humanity, to form a system\r\nthat, whilst it preserves one part of society from wretchedness, shall\r\nsecure the other from depredation.\r\n\r\nThe superstitious awe, the enslaving reverence, that formerly surrounded\r\naffluence, is passing away in all countries, and leaving the possessor\r\nof property to the convulsion of accidents. When wealth and splendour,\r\ninstead of fascinating the multitude, excite emotions of disgust; when,\r\ninstead of drawing forth admiration, it is beheld as an insult upon\r\nwretchedness; when the ostentatious appearance it makes serves to call\r\nthe right of it in question, the case of property becomes critical, and\r\nit is only in a system of justice that the possessor can contemplate\r\nsecurity.\r\n\r\nTo remove the danger, it is necessary to remove the antipathies, and\r\nthis can only be done by making property productive of a national\r\nblessing, extending to every individual. When the riches of one man\r\nabove another shall increase the national fund in the same proportion;\r\nwhen it shall be seen that the prosperity of that fund depends on the\r\nprosperity of individuals; when the more riches a man acquires, the\r\nbetter it shall be for the general mass; it is then that antipathies\r\nwill cease, and property be placed on the permanent basis of national\r\ninterest and protection.\r\n\r\nI have no property in France to become subject to the plan I propose.\r\nWhat I have which is not much, is in the United States of America. But\r\nI will pay one hundred pounds sterling towards this fund in rance, the\r\ninstant it shall be established; and I will pay the same sum in England\r\nwhenever a similar establishment shall take place in that country.\r\n\r\nA revolution in the state of civilization is the necessary companion of\r\nrevolutions in the system of government. If a revolution in any country\r\nbe from bad to good, or from good to bad, the state of what is called\r\ncivilization in that country, must be made conformable thereto, to give\r\nthat revolution effect. Despotic government supports itself by abject\r\ncivilization, in which debasement of the human mind, and wretchedness\r\nin the mass of the people, are the chief enterions. Such governments\r\nconsider man merely as an animal; that the exercise of intellectual\r\nfaculty is not his privilege; _that he has nothing to do with the laws\r\nbut to obey them _; (*) and they politically depend more upon breaking\r\nthe spirit of the people by poverty, than they fear enraging it by\r\ndesperation.\r\n\r\n     * Expression of Horsley, an English bishop, in the English\r\n     parliament.--Author.\r\n\r\nIt is a revolution in the state of civilization that will give\r\nperfection to the revolution of France. Already the conviction that\r\ngovernment by representation is the true system of government is\r\nspreading itself fast in the world. The reasonableness of it can be seen\r\nby all. The justness of it makes itself felt even by its opposers. But\r\nwhen a system of civilization, growing out of that system of government,\r\nshall be so organized that not a man or woman born in the Republic but\r\nshall inherit some means of beginning the world, and see before them\r\nthe certainty of escaping the miseries that under other governments\r\naccompany old age, the revolution of France will have an advocate and an\r\nally in the heart of all nations.\r\n\r\nAn army of principles will penetrate where an army of soldiers cannot;\r\nit will succeed where diplomatic management would fail: it is neither\r\nthe Rhine, the Channel, nor the Ocean that can arrest its progress: it\r\nwill march on the horizon of the world, and it will conquer.\r\n\r\n\r\nMEANS FOR CARRYING THE PROPOSED PLAN INTO EXECUTION,\r\n\r\nAND TO RENDER IT AT THE SAME TIME CONDUCIVE TO THE PUBLIC INTEREST.\r\n\r\nI. Each canton shall elect in its primary assemblies, three persons,\r\nas commissioners for that canton, who shall take cognizance, and keep\r\na register of all matters happening in that canton, conformable to the\r\ncharter that shall be established by law for carrying this plan into\r\nexecution.\r\n\r\nII. The law shall fix the manner in which the property of deceased\r\npersons shall be ascertained.\r\n\r\nIII. When the amount of the property of any deceased person shall be\r\nascertained, the principal heir to that property, or the eldest of the\r\nco-heirs, if of lawful age, or if under age the person authorized by the\r\nwill of the deceased to represent him or them, shall give bond to the\r\ncommissioners of the canton to pay the said tenth part thereof in four\r\nequal quarterly payments, within the space of one year or sooner, at the\r\nchoice of the payers. One half of the whole property shall remain as a\r\nsecurity until the bond be paid off.\r\n\r\nIV. The bond shall be registered in the office of the commissioners of\r\nthe canton, and the original bonds shall be deposited in the national\r\nbank at Paris. The bank shall publish every quarter of a year the amount\r\nof the bonds in its possession, and also the bonds that shall have been\r\npaid off, or what parts thereof, since the last quarterly publication.\r\n\r\nV. The national bank shall issue bank notes upon the security of the\r\nbonds in its possession. The notes so issued, shall be applied to pay\r\nthe pensions of aged persons, and the compensations to persons arriving\r\nat twenty-one years of age. It is both reasonable and generous to\r\nsuppose, that persons not under immediate necessity, will suspend their\r\nright of drawing on the fund, until it acquire, as it will do, a greater\r\ndegree of ability. In this case, it is proposed, that an honorary\r\nregister be kept, in each canton, of the names of the persons thus\r\nsuspending that right, at least during the present war.\r\n\r\nVI. As the inheritors of property must always take up their bonds in\r\nfour quarterly payments, or sooner if they choose, there will always\r\nbe _numéraire_ [cash] arriving at the bank after the expiration of the\r\nfirst quarter, to exchange for the bank notes that shall be brought in.\r\n\r\nVII. The bank notes being thus put in circulation, upon the best of all\r\npossible security, that of actual property, to more than four times\r\nthe amount of the bonds upon which the notes are issued, and with\r\n_numéraire_ continually arriving at the bank to exchange or pay them off\r\nwhenever they shall be presented for that purpose, they will acquire\r\na permanent value in all parts of the Republic. They can therefore be\r\nreceived in payment of taxes, or emprunts equal to numéraire, because\r\nthe government can always receive numéraire for them at the bank.\r\n\r\nVIII. It will be necessary that the payments of the ten per cent, be\r\nmade in numeraire for the first year from the establishment of the plan.\r\nBut after the expiration of the first year, the inheritors of property\r\nmay pay ten per cent either in bank notes issued upon the fund, or in\r\nnumeraire, If the payments be in numeraire, it will lie as a deposit at\r\nthe bank, to be exchanged for a quantity of notes equal to that amount;\r\nand if in notes issued upon the fund, it will cause a demand upon the\r\nfund, equal thereto; and thus the operation of the plan will create\r\nmeans to carry itself into execution.\r\n\r\nThomas Paine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIX. THE EIGHTEENTH FRUCTIDOR.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the People of France and the French Armies (1)\r\n\r\n     1 This pamphlet was written between the defeat of Pichegru's\r\n     attempt, September 4, 1794, and November 12, of the same\r\n     year, the date of the Bien-informé in which the publication\r\n     is noticed. General Pichegra (Charles), (1761-1804) having\r\n     joined a royalist conspiracy against the Republic, was\r\n     banished to Cayenne (1797), whence he escaped to England;\r\n     having returned to Paris (1804) he was imprisoned in the\r\n     Temple, and there found strangled by a silk handkerchief,\r\n     whether by his own or another's act remaining doubtful.\r\n     --Editor.\r\n\r\nWhen an extraordinary measure, not warranted by established\r\nconstitutional rules, and justifiable only on the supreme law of\r\nabsolute necessity, bursts suddenly upon us, we must, in order to form\r\na true judgment thereon, carry our researches back to the times that\r\npreceded and occasioned it. Taking up then the subject with respect to\r\nthe event of the Eighteenth of Fructidor on this ground, I go to examine\r\nthe state of things prior to that period. I begin with the establishment\r\nof the constitution of the year 3 of the French Republic.\r\n\r\nA better _organized_ constitution has never yet been devised by human\r\nwisdom. It is, in its organization, free from all the vices and defects\r\nto which other forms of government are more or less subject. I will\r\nspeak first of the legislative body, because the Legislature is, in the\r\nnatural order of things, the first power; the Executive is the first\r\nmagistrate.\r\n\r\nBy arranging the legislative body into two divisions, as is done in the\r\nFrench Constitution, the one, (the Council of Five Hundred,) whose part\r\nit is to conceive and propose laws; the other, a Council of Ancients, to\r\nreview, approve, or reject the laws proposed; all the security is given\r\nthat can arise from coolness of reflection acting upon, or correcting\r\nthe precipitancy or enthusiasm of conception and imagination. It is\r\nseldom that our first thought, even upon any subject, is sufficiently\r\njust.(1)\r\n\r\n     1 For Paine's ideas on the right division of representatives\r\n     into two chambers, which differ essentially from any\r\n     bicameral system ever adopted, see vol. ii., p. 444 of this\r\n     work; also, in the present volume, Chapter XXXIV.--\r\n     _Editor._.\r\n\r\nThe policy of renewing the Legislature by a third part each year, though\r\nnot entirely new, either in theory or in practice, is nevertheless one\r\nof the modern improvements in the science of government. It prevents,\r\non the one hand, that convulsion and precipitate change of measures\r\ninto which a nation might be surprised by the going out of the whole\r\nLegislature at the same time, and the instantaneous election of a new\r\none; on the other hand, it excludes that common interest from taking\r\nplace that might tempt a whole Legislature, whose term of duration\r\nexpired at once, to usurp the right of continuance. I go now to speak of\r\nthe Executive.\r\n\r\nIt is a principle uncontrovertible by reason, that each of the parts\r\nby which government is composed, should be so constructed as to be in\r\nperpetual maturity. We should laugh at the idea of a Council of Five\r\nHundred, or a Council of Ancients, or a Parliament, or any national\r\nassembly, who should be all children in leading strings and in the\r\ncradle, or be all sick, insane, deaf, dumb, lame or blind, at the same\r\ntime, or be all upon crutches, tottering with age or infirmities. Any\r\nform of government that was so constructed as to admit the possibility\r\nof such cases happening to a whole Legislature would justly be the\r\nridicule of the world; and on a parity of reasoning, it is equally as\r\nridiculous that the same cases should happen in that part of government\r\nwhich is called the Executive; yet this is the contemptible condition to\r\nwhich an Executive is always subject, and which is often happening,\r\nwhen it is placed in an hereditary individual called a king. When\r\nthat individual is in either of the cases before mentioned, the whole\r\nExecutive is in the same case; for himself is the whole. He is then (as\r\nan Executive) the ridiculous picture of what a Legislature would be if\r\nall its members were in the same case. The one is a whole made up of\r\nparts, the other a whole without parts; and anything happening to the\r\none, (as a part or sec-tion of the government,) is parallel to the same\r\nthing happening to the other.\r\n\r\nAs, therefore, an hereditary executive called a king is a perfect\r\nabsurdity in itself, any attachment to it is equally as absurd. It is\r\nneither instinct or reason; and if this attachment is what is called\r\nroyalism in France, then is a royalist inferior in character to every\r\nspecies of the animal world; for what can that being be who acts neither\r\nby instinct nor by reason? Such a being merits rather our derision\r\nthan our pity; and it is only when it assumes to act its folly that it\r\nbecomes capable of provoking republican indignation. In every other\r\ncase it is too contemptible to excite anger. For my own part, when I\r\ncontemplate the self-evident absurdity of the thing, I can scarcely\r\npermit myself to believe that there exists in the high-minded nation of\r\nFrance such a mean and silly animal as a royalist.\r\n\r\nAs it requires but a single glance of thought to see (as is before said)\r\nthat all the parts of which government is composed must be at all times\r\nin a state of full maturity, it was not possible that men acting under\r\nthe influence of reason, could, in forming a Constitution, admit an\r\nhereditary Executive, any more than an hereditary Legislature. I go\r\ntherefore to examine the other cases.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, (rejecting the hereditary system,) shall the\r\nExecutive by election be an _individual or a plurality_.\r\n\r\nAn individual by election is almost as bad as the hereditary system,\r\nexcept that there is always a better chance of not having an idiot. But\r\nhe will never be any thing more than a chief of a party, and none but\r\nthose of that party will have access to him. He will have no person\r\nto consult with of a standing equal with himself, and consequently be\r\ndeprived of the advantages arising from equal discussion.\r\n\r\nThose whom he admits in consultation will be ministers of his own\r\nappointment, who, if they displease by their advice, must expect to\r\nbe dismissed. The authority also is too great, and the business too\r\ncomplicated, to be intrusted to the ambition or the judgment of an\r\nindividual; and besides these cases, the sudden change of measures\r\nthat might follow by the going out of an individual Executive, and the\r\nelection of a new one, would hold the affairs of a nation in a state of\r\nperpetual uncertainty. We come then to the case of a plural Executive.\r\n\r\nIt must be sufficiently plural, to give opportunity to discuss all the\r\nvarious subjects that in the course of national business may come before\r\nit; and yet not so numerous as to endanger the necessary secrecy that\r\ncertain cases, such as those of war, require.\r\n\r\nEstablishing, then, plurality as a principle, the only question is, What\r\nshall be the number of that plurality?\r\n\r\nThree are too few either for the variety or the quantity of business.\r\nThe Constitution has adopted five; and experience has shewn, from the\r\ncommencement of the Constitution to the time of the election of the new\r\nlegislative third, that this number of Directors, when well chosen, is\r\nsufficient for all national executive purposes; and therefore a greater\r\nnumber would be only an unnecessary expence. That the measures of the\r\nDirectory during that period were well concerted is proved by their\r\nsuccess; and their being well concerted shews they were well discussed;\r\nand, therefore, that five is a sufficient number with respect to\r\ndiscussion; and, on the other hand, the secret, whenever there was\r\none, (as in the case of the expedition to Ireland,) was well kept, and\r\ntherefore the number is not too great to endanger the necessary secrecy.\r\n\r\nThe reason why the two Councils are numerous is not from the necessity\r\nof their being so, on account of business, but because that every\r\npart of the republic shall find and feel itself in the national\r\nrepresentation.\r\n\r\nNext to the general principle of government by representation, the\r\nexcellence of the French Constitution consists in providing means to\r\nprevent that abuse of power that might arise by letting it remain too\r\nlong in the same hands. This wise precaution pervades every part of the\r\nConstitution. Not only the legislature is renewable by a third every\r\nyear, but the president of each of the Councils is renewable every\r\nmonth; and of the Directory, one member each year, and its president\r\nevery three months. Those who formed the Constitution cannot be accused\r\nof having contrived for themselves. The Constitution, in this respect,\r\nis as impartially constructed as if those who framed it were to die as\r\nsoon as they had finished their work.\r\n\r\nThe only defect in the Constitution is that of having narrowed the right\r\nof suffrage; and it is in a great measure due to this narrowing the\r\nright, that the last elections have not generally been good. My former\r\ncolleagues will, I presume, pardon my saying this to day, when they\r\nrecollect my arguments against this defect, at the time the Constitution\r\nwas discussed in the Convention.(1)\r\n\r\n     1  See Chapters XXIV. and XXV., also the letter prefaced to\r\n     XXVIII., in this volume.--_Editor._,\r\n\r\nI will close this part of the subject by remarking on one of the most\r\nvulgar and absurd sayings or dogmas that ever yet imposed itself upon\r\nthe world, which is, \"_that a Republic is fit only for a small country,\r\nand a Monarchy for a large one_.\" Ask those who say this their reasons\r\nwhy it is so, and they can give none.\r\n\r\nLet us then examine the case. If the quantity of knowledge in a\r\ngovernment ought to be proportioned to the extent of a country, and\r\nthe magnitude and variety of its affairs, it follows, as an undeniable\r\nresult, that this absurd dogma is false, and that the reverse of it is\r\ntrue. As to what is called Monarchy, if it be adaptable to any country\r\nit can only be so to a small one, whose concerns are few, little\r\ncomplicated, and all within the comprehension of an individual. But when\r\nwe come to a country of large extent, vast population, and whose affairs\r\nare great, numerous, and various, it is the representative republican\r\nsystem only, that can collect into the government the quantity\r\nof knowledge necessary to govern to the best national advantage.\r\nMontesquieu, who was strongly inclined to republican government,\r\nsheltered himself under this absurd dogma; for he had always the\r\nBastile before his eyes when he was speaking of Republics, and therefore\r\n_pretended_ not to write for France. Condorcet governed himself by\r\nthe same caution, but it was caution only, for no sooner had he the\r\nopportunity of speaking fully out than he did it. When I say this of\r\nCondorcet, I know it as a fact. In a paper published in Paris, July,\r\n1791, entitled, \"_The Republican, or the Defender of Representative\r\nGovernment?_\" is a piece signed _Thomas Paine_.(1) That piece was\r\nconcerted between Condorcet and myself. I wrote the original in\r\nEnglish, and Condorcet translated it. The object of it was to expose the\r\nabsurdity and falsehood of the above mentioned dogma.\r\n\r\n     1 Chapter II. of this volume. See also my \"Life of Paine,\"\r\n     vol. i., p. 311.--Editor.\r\n\r\nHaving thus concisely glanced at the excellencies of the Constitution,\r\nand the superiority of the representative system of government over\r\nevery other system, (if any other can be called a system,) I come to\r\nspeak of the circumstances that have intervened between the time the\r\nConstitution was established and the event that took place on the 18th\r\nof Fructidor of the present year.\r\n\r\nAlmost as suddenly as the morning light dissipates darkness, did the\r\nestablishment of the Constitution change the face of affairs in France.\r\nSecurity succeeded to terror, prosperity to distress, plenty to famine,\r\nand confidence increased as the days multiplied, until the coming of the\r\nnew third. A series of victories unequalled in the world, followed\r\neach other, almost too rapidly to be counted, and too numerous to be\r\nremembered. The Coalition, every where defeated and confounded, crumbled\r\naway like a ball of dust in the hand of a giant. Every thing, during\r\nthat period, was acted on such a mighty scale that reality appeared a\r\ndream, and truth outstript romance. It may figuratively be said, that\r\nthe Rhine and the Rubicon (Germany and Italy) replied in triumphs to\r\neach other, and the echoing Alps prolonged the shout. I will not\r\nhere dishonour a great description by noticing too much the English\r\ngovernment. It is sufficient to say paradoxically, that in the magnitude\r\nof its littleness it cringed, it intrigued, and sought protection in\r\ncorruption.\r\n\r\nThough the achievements of these days might give trophies to a nation\r\nand laurels to its heroes, they derive their full radiance of glory\r\nfrom the principle they inspired and the object they accomplished.\r\nDesolation, chains, and slavery had marked the progress of former wars,\r\nbut to conquer for Liberty had never been thought of. To receive\r\nthe degrading submission of a distressed and subjugated people, and\r\ninsultingly permit them to live, made the chief triumph of former\r\nconquerors; but to receive them with fraternity, to break their chains,\r\nto tell them they are free, and teach them to be so, make a new volume\r\nin the history of man.\r\n\r\nAmidst those national honours, and when only two enemies remained, both\r\nof whom had solicited peace, and one of them had signed preliminaries,\r\nthe election of the new third commenced. Every thing was made easy to\r\nthem. All difficulties had been conquered before they arrived at the\r\ngovernment. They came in the olive days of the revolution, and all they\r\nhad to do was not to do mischief.\r\n\r\nIt was, however, not difficult to foresee, that the elections would not\r\nbe generally good. The horrid days of Robespierre were still remembered,\r\nand the gratitude due to those who had put an end to them was forgotten.\r\n\r\nThousands who, by passive approbation during that tremendous scene, had\r\nexperienced no suffering, assumed the merit of being the loudest against\r\nit. Their cowardice in not opposing it, became courage when it was over.\r\nThey exclaimed against Terrorism as if they had been the heroes that\r\noverthrew it, and rendered themselves ridiculous by fantastically\r\noveracting moderation. The most noisy of this class, that I have met\r\nwith, are those who suffered nothing. They became all things, at all\r\ntimes, to all men; till at last they laughed at principle. It was the\r\nreal republicans who suffered most during the time of Robespierre. The\r\npersecution began upon them on the 31st of May, 1793, and ceased only\r\nby the exertions of the remnant that survived.\r\n\r\nIn such a confused state of things as preceded the late elections the\r\npublic mind was put into a condition of being easily deceived; and it\r\nwas almost natural that the hypocrite would stand the best chance of\r\nbeing elected into the new third. Had those who, since their election,\r\nhave thrown the public affairs into confusion by counter-revolutionary\r\nmeasures, declared themselves beforehand, they would have been denounced\r\ninstead of being chosen. Deception was necessary to their success.\r\nThe Constitution obtained a full establishment; the revolution was\r\nconsidered as complete; and the war on the eve of termination. In such a\r\nsituation, the mass of the people, fatigued by a long revolution, sought\r\nrepose; and in their elections they looked out for quiet men. They\r\nunfortunately found hypocrites. Would any of the primary assemblies\r\nhave voted for a civil war? Certainly they would not. But the electoral\r\nassemblies of some departments have chosen men whose measures, since\r\ntheir election, tended to no other end but to provoke it. Either those\r\nelectors have deceived their constituents of the primary assemblies, or\r\nthey have been themselves deceived in the choice they made of deputies.\r\n\r\nThat there were some direct but secret conspirators in the new third can\r\nscarcely admit of a doubt; but it is most reasonable to suppose that a\r\ngreat part were seduced by the vanity of thinking they could do better\r\nthan those whom they succeeded. Instead of trusting to experience, they\r\nattempted experiments. This counter-disposition prepared them to fall in\r\nwith any measures contrary to former measures, and that without seeing,\r\nand probably without suspecting, the end to which they led.\r\n\r\nNo sooner were the members of the new third arrived at the seat of\r\ngovernment, than expectation was excited to see how they would act.\r\nTheir motions were watched by all parties, and it was impossible for\r\nthem to steal a march unobserved. They had it in their power to do great\r\ngood, or great mischief. A firm and manly conduct on their part, uniting\r\nwith that of the Directory and their colleagues, would have terminated\r\nthe war. But the moment before them was not the moment of hesitation. He\r\nthat hesitates in such situation is lost.\r\n\r\nThe first public act of the Council of Five Hundred was the election of\r\nPichegru to the presidency of that Council. He arrived at it by a very\r\nlarge majority, and the public voice was in his favour. I among the rest\r\nwas one who rejoiced at it. But if the defection of Pichegru was at that\r\ntime known to Condé, and consequently to Pitt, it unveils the cause that\r\nretarded all negotiations for peace.(1) They interpreted that election\r\ninto a signal of a counter-revolution, and were waiting for it; and they\r\nmistook the respect shown to Pichegru, founded on the supposition of his\r\nintegrity, as a symptom of national revolt. Judging of things by their\r\nown foolish ideas of government, they ascribed appearances to causes\r\nbetween which there was no connection. Every thing on their part has\r\nbeen a comedy of errors, and the actors have been chased from the stage.\r\n\r\n     1 Louis Joseph de Bourbon, Prince de Condé (1736-1818),\r\n     organized the French emigrants on the Rhine into an army\r\n     which was incorporated with that of Austria but paid by\r\n     England. He converted Pichegru into a secret partisan of the\r\n     Bourbons. He ultimately returned to France with Louis\r\n     XVIII., who made him colonel of infantry and master of the\r\n     royal household.--_Editor._,\r\n\r\nTwo or three decades of the new sessions passed away without any\r\nthing very material taking place; but matters soon began to explain\r\nthemselves. The first thing that struck the public mind was, that no\r\nmore was heard of negotiations for peace, and that public business stood\r\nstill. It was not the object of the conspirators that there should be\r\npeace; but as it was necessary to conceal their object, the Constitution\r\nwas ransacked to find pretences for delays. In vain did the Directory\r\nexplain to them the state of the finances and the wants of the army. The\r\ncommittee, charged with that business, trifled away its time by a series\r\nof unproductive reports, and continued to sit only to produce more.\r\nEvery thing necessary to be done was neglected, and every thing improper\r\nwas attempted. Pichegru occupied himself about forming a national guard\r\nfor the Councils--the suspicious signal of war,--Camille Jordan about\r\npriests and bells, and the emigrants, with whom he had associated\r\nduring the two years he was in England.1 Willot and Delarue attacked the\r\nDirectory: their object was to displace some one of the directors, to\r\nget in another of their own. Their motives with respect to the age of\r\nBarras (who is as old as he wishes to be, and has been a little too old\r\nfor them) were too obvious not to be seen through.(2)\r\n\r\n     1 Paine's pamphlet, addressed to Jordan, deals mainly with\r\n     religions matters, and is reserved for oar fourth volume.--\r\n     _Editor._.\r\n\r\n     2 Paul François Jean Nicolas Barras (1755-1899) was\r\n     President of the Directory at this time, 1797.--_Editor._.\r\n\r\nIn this suspensive state of things, the public mind, filled with\r\napprehensions, became agitated, and without knowing what it might be,\r\nlooked for some extraordinary event. It saw, for it could not avoid\r\nseeing, that things could not remain long in the state they were in,\r\nbut it dreaded a convulsion. That spirit of triflingness which it\r\nhad indulged too freely when in a state of security, and which it is\r\nprobable the new agents had interpreted into indifference about the\r\nsuccess of the Republic, assumed a serious aspect that afforded to\r\nconspiracy no hope of aid; but still it went on. It plunged itself into\r\nnew measures with the same ill success, and the further it went the\r\nfurther the public mind retired. The conspiracy saw nothing around it to\r\ngive it encouragement.\r\n\r\nThe obstinacy, however, with which it persevered in its repeated\r\nattacks upon the Directory, in framing laws in favour of emigrants and\r\nrefractory priests, and in every thing inconsistent with the immediate\r\nsafety of the Republic, and which served to encourage the enemy to\r\nprolong the war, admitted of no other direct interpretation than that\r\nsomething was rotten in the Council of Five Hundred. The evidence of\r\ncircumstances became every day too visible not to be seen, and too\r\nstrong to be explained away. Even as errors, (to say no worse of\r\nthem,) they are not entitled to apology; for where knowledge is a duty,\r\nignorance is a crime.\r\n\r\nThe more serious republicans, who had better opportunities than the\r\ngenerality had, of knowing the state of politics, began to take\r\nthe alarm, and formed themselves into a Society, by the name of the\r\nConstitutional Club. It is the only Society of which I have been a\r\nmember in France; and I went to this because it was become necessary\r\nthat the friends of the Republic should rally round the standard of\r\nthe constitution. I met there several of the original patriots of the\r\nrevolution; I do not mean of the last order of Jacobins, but of the\r\nfirst of that name. The faction in the Council of Five Hundred,\r\nwho, finding no counsel from the public, began to be frightened at\r\nappearances, fortified itself against the dread of this Society, by\r\npassing a law to dissolve it. The constitutionality of the law was at\r\nleast doubtful: but the Society, that it might not give the example of\r\nexasperating matters already too much inflamed, suspended its meetings.\r\n\r\nA matter, however, of much greater moment soon after presented itself.\r\nIt was the march of four regiments, some of whom, in the line of their\r\nroute, had to pass within about twelve leagues of Paris, which is the\r\nboundary the Constitution had fixed as the distance of any armed\r\nforce from the legislative body. In another state of things, such a\r\ncircumstance would not have been noticed. But conspiracy is quick of\r\nsuspicion, and the fear which the faction in the Council of Five\r\nHundred manifested upon this occasion could not have suggested itself\r\nto innocent men; neither would innocent men have expostulated with the\r\nDirectory upon the case, in the manner these men did. The question they\r\nurged went to extort from the Directory, and to make known to the enemy,\r\nwhat the destination of the troops was. The leaders of the faction\r\nconceived that the troops were marching against them; and the conduct\r\nthey adopted in consequence of it was sufficient to justify the measure,\r\neven if it had been so. From what other motive than the consciousness of\r\ntheir own designs could they have fear? The troops, in every instance,\r\nhad been the gallant defenders of the Republic, and the openly declared\r\nfriends of the Constitution; the Directory had been the same, and if the\r\nfaction were not of a different description neither fear nor suspicion\r\ncould have had place among them.\r\n\r\nAll those manouvres in the Council were acted under the most\r\nprofessional attachment to the Constitution; and this as necessarily\r\nserved to enfeeble their projects. It is exceedingly difficult, and next\r\nto impossible, to conduct a conspiracy, and still more so to give it\r\nsuccess, in a popular government. The disguised and feigned pretences\r\nwhich men in such cases are obliged to act in the face of the public,\r\nsuppress the action of the faculties, and give even to natural courage\r\nthe features of timidity. They are not half the men they would be where\r\nno disguise is necessary. It is impossible to be a hypocrite and to be\r\nbrave at the same instant.\r\n\r\nThe faction, by the imprudence of its measures, upon the march of\r\nthe troops, and upon the declarations of the officers and soldiers to\r\nsupport the Republic and the Constitution against all open or concealed\r\nattempts to overturn them, had gotten itself involved with the army, and\r\nin effect declared itself a party against it. On the one hand, laws were\r\nproposed to admit emigrants and refractory priests as free citizens; and\r\non the other hand to exclude the troops from Paris, and to punish the\r\nsoldiers who had declared to support the Republic In the mean time all\r\nnegociations for peace went backward; and the enemy, still recruiting\r\nits forces, rested to take advantage of circumstances. Excepting the\r\nabsence of hostilities, it was a state worse than war.\r\n\r\nIf all this was not a conspiracy, it had at least the features of one,\r\nand was pregnant with the same mischiefs. The eyes of the faction could\r\nnot avoid being open to the dangers to which it obstinately exposed\r\nthe Republic; yet still it persisted. During this scene, the journals\r\ndevoted to the faction were repeatedly announcing the near approach of\r\npeace with Austria and with England, and often asserting that it was\r\nconcluded. This falsehood could be intended for no other purpose than to\r\nkeep the eyes of the people shut against the dangers to which they were\r\nexposed.\r\n\r\nTaking all circumstances together, it was impossible that such a state\r\nof things could continue long; and at length it was resolved to bring it\r\nto an issue. There is good reason to believe that the affair of the\r\n18th Fructidor (September 4) was intended to have taken place two days\r\nbefore; but on recollecting that it was the 2d of September, a day\r\nmournful in the annals of the revolution, it was postponed. When the\r\nissue arrived, the faction found to its cost it had no party among the\r\npublic. It had sought its own disasters, and was left to suffer the\r\nconsequences. Foreign enemies, as well as those of the interior, if\r\nany such there be, ought to see in the event of this day that all\r\nexpectation of aid from any part of the public in support of a counter\r\nrevolution is delusion. In a state of security the thoughtless, who\r\ntrembled at terror, may laugh at principles of Liberty (for they have\r\nlaughed) but it is one thing to indulge a foolish laugh, quite another\r\nthing to surrender Liberty.\r\n\r\nConsidering the event of the 18th Fructidor in a political light, it is\r\none of those that are justifiable only on the supreme law of absolute\r\nnecessity, and it is the necessity abstracted from the event that is to\r\nbe deplored. The event itself is matter of joy. Whether the manouvres in\r\nthe Council of Five Hundred were the conspiracy of a few, aided l>y the\r\nperverseness of many, or whether it had a deeper root, the dangers were\r\nthe same. It was impossible to go on. Every thing was at stake, and\r\nall national business at a stand. The case reduced itself to a simple\r\nalternative--shall the Republic be destroyed by the darksome manouvres\r\n-of a faction, or shall it be preserved by an exceptional act?\r\n\r\nDuring the American Revolution, and that after the State constitutions\r\nwere established, particular cases arose that rendered it necessary to\r\nact in a manner that would have been treasonable in a state of peace. At\r\none time Congress invested General Washington with dictatorial power.\r\nAt another time the Government of Pennsylvania suspended itself and\r\ndeclared martial law. It was the necessity of the times only that\r\nmade the apology of those extraordinary measures. But who was it that\r\nproduced the necessity of an extraordinary measure in France? A faction,\r\nand that in the face of prosperity and success. Its conduct is without\r\napology; and it is on the faction only that the exceptional measure has\r\nfallen. The public has suffered no inconvenience. If there are some men\r\nmore disposed than others not to act severely, I have a right to place\r\nmyself in that class; the whole of my political life invariably proves\r\nit; yet I cannot see, taking all parts of the case together, what else,\r\nor what better, could have been done, than has been done. It was a\r\ngreat stroke, applied in a great crisis, that crushed in an instant,\r\nand without the loss of a life, all the hopes of the enemy, and restored\r\ntranquillity to the interior.\r\n\r\nThe event was ushered in by the discharge of two cannon at four in the\r\nmorning, and was the only noise that was heard throughout the day. It\r\nnaturally excited a movement among the Parisians to enquire the cause.\r\nThey soon learned it, and the countenance they carried was easy to be\r\ninterpreted. It was that of a people who, for some time past, had\r\nbeen oppressed with apprehensions of some direful event, and who felt\r\nthemselves suddenly relieved, by finding what it was. Every one went\r\nabout his business, or followed his curiosity in quietude. It resembled\r\nthe cheerful tranquillity of the day when Louis XVI. absconded in 1791,\r\nand like that day it served to open the eyes of the nation.\r\n\r\nIf we take a review of the various events, as well conspiracies as\r\ncommotions, that have succeeded each other in this revolution, we shall\r\nsee how the former have wasted consumptively away, and the consequences\r\nof the latter have softened. The 31st May and its consequences were\r\nterrible. That of the 9th and 10th Thermidor, though glorious for the\r\nrepublic, as it overthrew one of the most horrid and cruel despotisms\r\nthat ever raged, was nevertheless marked with many circumstances\r\nof severe and continued retaliation. The commotions of Germinal and\r\nPrairial of the year 3, and of Vendemaire of the year 4, were many\r\ndegrees below those that preceded them, and affected but a small part of\r\nthe public. This of Pichegru and his associates has been crushed in an\r\ninstant, without the stain of blood, and without involving the public in\r\nthe least inconvenience.\r\n\r\nThese events taken in a series, mark the progress of the Republic from\r\ndisorder to stability. The contrary of this is the case in all parts\r\nof the British dominions. There, commotions are on an ascending scale;\r\nevery one is higher than the former. That of the sailors had nearly\r\nbeen the overthrow of the government. But the most potent of all is the\r\ninvisible commotion in the Bank. It works with the silence of time, and\r\nthe certainty of death. Every thing happening in France is curable; but\r\nthis is beyond the reach of nature or invention.\r\n\r\nLeaving the event of the 18th Fructidor to justify itself by the\r\nnecessity that occasioned it, and glorify itself by the happiness of\r\nits consequences, I come to cast a coup-d'oil on the present state of\r\naffairs.\r\n\r\nWe have seen by the lingering condition of the negociations for peace,\r\nthat nothing was to be expected from them, in the situation that things\r\nstood prior to the 18th Fructidor. The armies had done wonders, but\r\nthose wonders were rendered unproductive by the wretched manouvres of a\r\nfaction. New exertions are now necessary to repair the mischiefs which\r\nthat faction has done. The electoral bodies, in some Departments, who\r\nby an injudicious choice, or a corrupt influence, have sent improper\r\ndeputies to the Legislature, have some atonement to make to their\r\ncountry. The evil originated with them, and the least they can do is to\r\nbe among the foremost to repair it.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, in vain to lament an evil that is past. There is neither\r\nmanhood nor policy in grief; and it often happens that an error in\r\npolitics, like an error in war, admits of being turned to greater\r\nadvantage than if it had not occurred. The enemy, encouraged by that\r\nerror, presumes too much, and becomes doubly foiled by the re-action.\r\nEngland, unable to conquer, has stooped to corrupt; and defeated in\r\nthe last, as in the first, she is in a worse condition than before.\r\nContinually increasing her crimes, she increases the measure of her\r\natonement, and multiplies the sacrifices she must make to obtain peace.\r\nNothing but the most obstinate stupidity could have induced her to let\r\nslip the opportunity when it was within her reach. In addition to the\r\nprospect of new expenses, she is now, to use Mr. Pitt's own figurative\r\nexpression against France, _not only on the brink, but in the gulph\r\nof bankruptcy_. There is no longer any mystery in paper money. Call\r\nit assignats, mandats, exchequer bills, or bank notes, it is still the\r\nsame. Time has solved the problem, and experience has fixed its fate.(1)\r\n\r\n     1 See Chapter XXVI. of this volume.--_Editor._.\r\n\r\nThe government of that unfortunate country discovers its faithlessness\r\nso much, that peace on any terms with her is scarcely worth obtaining.\r\nOf what use is peace with a government that will employ that peace for\r\nno other purpose than to repair, as far as it is possible, her shattered\r\nfinances and broken credit, and then go to war again? Four times within\r\nthe last ten years, from the time the American war closed, has the\r\nAnglo-germanic government of England been meditating fresh war. First\r\nwith France on account of Holland, in 1787; afterwards with Russia;\r\nthen with Spain, on account of Nootka Sound; and a second time against\r\nFrance, to overthrow her revolution. Sometimes that government employs\r\nPrussia against Austria; at another time Austria against Prussia; and\r\nalways one or the other, or both against France. Peace with such a\r\ngovernment is only a treacherous cessation of hostilities.\r\n\r\nThe frequency of wars on the part of England, within the last century,\r\nmore than before, must have had some cause that did not exist prior to\r\nthat epoch. It is not difficult to discover what that cause is. It is\r\nthe mischievous compound of an Elector of the Germanic body and a King\r\nof England; and which necessarily must, at some day or other, become\r\nan object of attention to France. That one nation has not a right to\r\ninterfere in the internal government of another nation, is admitted; and\r\nin this point of view, France has no right to dictate to England what\r\nits form of government shall be. If it choose to have a thing called a\r\nKing, or whether that King shall be a man or an ass, is a matter with\r\nwhich France has no business. But whether an Elector of the Germanic\r\nbody shall be King of England, is an _external_ case, with which\r\nFrance and every other nation, who suffers inconvenience and injury in\r\nconsequence of it, has a right to interfere.\r\n\r\nIt is from this mischievous compound of Elector and King, that\r\noriginates a great part of the troubles that vex the continent of\r\nEurope; and with respect to England, it has been the cause of her\r\nimmense national debt, the ruin of her finances, and the insolvency of\r\nher bank. All intrigues on the continent, in which England is a party,\r\nor becomes involved, are generated by, and act through, the medium of\r\nthis Anglo-germanic compound. It will be necessary to dissolve it. Let\r\nthe Elector retire to his Electorate, and the world will have peace.\r\n\r\nEngland herself has given examples of interference in matters of this\r\nkind, and that in cases where injury was only apprehended. She engaged\r\nin a long and expensive war against France (called the succession war)\r\nto prevent a grandson of Louis the Fourteenth being king of Spain;\r\nbecause, said she, _it will be injurious_ to me; and she has been\r\nfighting and intriguing against what was called the family-compact ever\r\nsince. In 1787 she threatened France with war to prevent a connection\r\nbetween France and Hoi-land; and in all her propositions of peace to-day\r\nshe is dictating separations. But if she look at the Anglo-germanic\r\ncompact at home, called the Hanover succession, she cannot avoid seeing\r\nthat France necessarily must, some day or other, take up that subject,\r\nand make the return of the Elector to his Electorate one of the\r\nconditions of peace. There will be no lasting peace between the two\r\ncountries till this be done, and the sooner it be done the better will\r\nit be for both.\r\n\r\nI have not been in any company where this matter aas been a topic, that\r\ndid not see it in the light it is here stated. Even Barthélémy,(1) when\r\nhe first came to the Directory (and Barthélémy was never famous for\r\npatriotism) acknowledged in my hearing, and in company with Derché,\r\nSecretary to the Legation at Lille, the connection of an Elector of\r\nGermany and a King of England to be injurious to France. I do not,\r\nhowever, mention it from a wish to embarrass the negociation for peace.\r\nThe Directory has fixed its _ultimatum_; but if that ultimatum be\r\nrejected, the obligation to adhere to it is discharged, and a new one\r\nmay be assumed. So wretchedly has Pitt managed his opportunities» that\r\nevery succeeding negociation has ended in terms more against him than\r\nthe former. If the Directory had bribed him, he could not serve his\r\ninterest better than he does. He serves it as Lord North served that of\r\nAmerica, which finished in the discharge of his master.*\r\n\r\n     1 Marquis de Barthélémy (François) (1750-1830) entered the\r\n     Directory in June, 1796, through royalist influence. He\r\n     shared Pichegru's banishment, and subsequently became an\r\n     agent of Louis XVIII.--_Editor._\r\n\r\n     * The father of Pitt, when a member of the House of Commons,\r\n     exclaiming one day, during a former war, against the\r\n     enormous and ruinous expense of German connections, as the\r\n     offspring of the Hanover succession, and borrowing a\r\n     metaphor from the story of Prometheus, cried out: \"Thus,\r\n     Hie Prometheus, is Britain chained to the barren rock of\r\n     Hanover; whilst the imperial eagle preys upon her vitals.\"--\r\n     Author.\r\n\r\nThus far I had written when the negociation at Lille became suspended,\r\nin consequence of which I delayed the publication, that the ideas\r\nsuggested in this letter might not intrude themselves during the\r\ninterval. The _ultimatum_ offered by the Directory, as the terms of\r\npeace, was more moderate than the government of England had a right to\r\nexpect. That government, though the provoker of the war, and the first\r\nthat committed hostilities by sending away the ambassador Chauvelin,(**)\r\nhad formerly talked of demanding from France, _indemnification for\r\nthe past and security for the future_. France, in her turn, might have\r\nretorted, and demanded the same from England; but she did not. As it was\r\nEngland that, in consequence of her bankruptcy, solicited peace, France\r\noffered it to her on the simple condition of her restoring the islands\r\nshe had taken. The ultimatum has been rejected, and the negociation\r\nbroken off. The spirited part of France will say, _tant mieux_, so much\r\nthe better.\r\n\r\n     ** It was stipulated in the treaty of commerce between\r\n     France and England, concluded at Paris, that the sending\r\n     away an ambassador by either party, should be taken as an\r\n     act of hostility by the other party. The declaration of war\r\n     (Feb. M *793) by the Convention, of which I was then a\r\n     member and know well the case, was made in exact conformity\r\n     to this article in the treaty; for it was not a declaration\r\n     of war against England, but a declaration that the French\r\n     Republic is in war with England; the first act of hostility\r\n     having been committed by England. The declaration was made\r\n     immediately on Chauvelin's return to France, and in\r\n     consequence of it. Mr. Pitt should inform himself of things\r\n     better than he does, before he prates so much about them, or\r\n     of the sending away of Malmesbury, who was only on a visit\r\n     of permission.--Author.\r\n\r\nHow the people of England feel on the breaking up of the negociation,\r\nwhich was entirely the act of their own Government, is best known to\r\nthemselves; but from what I know of the two nations, France ought to\r\nhold herself perfectly indifferent about a peace with the Government of\r\nEngland. Every day adds new strength to France and new embarrassments\r\nto her enemy. The resources of the one increase, as those of the other\r\nbecome exhausted. England is now reduced to the same system of paper\r\nmoney from which France has emerged, and we all know the inevitable fate\r\nof that system. It is not a victory over a few ships, like that on the\r\ncoast of Holland, that gives the least support or relief to a paper\r\nsystem. On the news of this victory arriving in England, the funds did\r\nnot rise a farthing. The Government rejoiced, but its creditors were\r\nsilent.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to find a motive, except in folly and madness, for the\r\nconduct of the English government. Every calculation and prediction of\r\nMr. Pitt has turned out directly the contrary; yet still he predicts.\r\nHe predicted, with all the solemn assurance of a magician, that France\r\nwould be bankrupt in a few months. He was right as to the thing, but\r\nwrong as to the place, for the bankruptcy happened in England whilst the\r\nwords were yet warm upon his lips. To find out what will happen, it is\r\nonly necessary to know what Mr. Pitt predicts. He is a true prophet if\r\ntaken in the reverse.\r\n\r\nSuch is the ruinous condition that England is now in, that great as\r\nthe difficulties of war are to the people, the difficulties that would\r\naccompany peace are equally as great to the Government. Whilst the war\r\ncontinues, Mr. Pitt has a pretence for shutting up the bank. But as that\r\npretence could last no longer than the war lasted, he dreads the peace\r\nthat would expose the absolute bankruptcy of the government, and unveil\r\nto a deceived nation the ruinous effect of his measures. Peace would be\r\na day of accounts to him, and he shuns it as an insolvent debtor shuns\r\na meeting of his creditors. War furnishes him with many pretences; peace\r\nwould furnish him with none, and he stands alarmed at its consequences.\r\nHis conduct in the negociation at Lille can be easily interpreted. It is\r\nnot for the sake of the nation that he asks to retain some of the taken\r\nislands; for what are islands to a nation that has already too many for\r\nher own good, or what are they in comparison to the expense of another\r\ncampaign in the present depreciating state of the English funds? (And\r\neven then those islands must be restored.)\r\n\r\nNo, it is not for the sake of the nation that he asks. It is for the\r\nsake of himself. It is as if he said to France, Give me some pretence,\r\ncover me from disgrace when my day of reckoning comes!\r\n\r\nAny person acquainted with the English Government knows that every\r\nMinister has some dread of what is called in England the winding up\r\nof accounts at the end of a war; that is, the final settlement of all\r\nexpenses incurred by the war; and no Minister had ever so great cause of\r\ndread as Mr. Pitt. A burnt child dreads the fire, and Pitt has had some\r\nexperience upon this case. The winding up of accounts at the end of the\r\nAmerican war was so great, that, though he was not the cause of it,\r\nand came into the Ministry with great popularity, he lost it all by\r\nundertaking, what was impossible for him to avoid, the voluminous\r\nbusiness of the winding up. If such was the case in settling the\r\naccounts of his predecessor, how much more has he to apprehend when the\r\naccounts to be settled are his own? All men in bad circumstances\r\nhate the settlement of accounts, and Pitt, as a Minister, is of that\r\ndescription.\r\n\r\nBut let us take a view of things on a larger ground than the case of\r\na Minister. It will then be found, that England, on a comparison of\r\nstrength with France, when both nations are disposed to exert their\r\nutmost, has no possible chance of success. The efforts that England made\r\nwithin the last century were not generated on the ground of _natural\r\nability_, but of _artificial anticipations_. She ran posterity into\r\ndebt, and swallowed up in one generation the resources of several\r\ngenerations yet to come, till the project can be pursued no longer. It\r\nis otherwise in France. The vastness of her territory and her population\r\nrender the burden easy that would make a bankrupt of a country like\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nIt is not the weight of a thing, but the numbers who are to bear that\r\nweight, that makes it feel light or heavy to the shoulders of those who\r\nbear it. A land-tax of half as much in the pound as the land-tax is in\r\nEngland, will raise nearly four times as much revenue in France as is\r\nraised in England. This is a scale easily understood, by which all the\r\nother sections of productive revenue can be measured. Judge then of the\r\ndifference of natural ability.\r\n\r\nEngland is strong in a navy; but that navy costs about eight millions\r\nsterling a-year, and is one of the causes that has hastened her\r\nbankruptcy. The history of navy bills sufficiently proves this. But\r\nstrong as England is in this case, the fate of navies must finally be\r\ndecided by the natural ability of each country to carry its navy to the\r\ngreatest extent; and France is able to support a navy twice as large as\r\nthat of England, with less than half the expense per head on the people,\r\nwhich the present navy of England costs.\r\n\r\nWe all know that a navy cannot be raised as expeditiously as an army.\r\nBut as the average duration of a navy, taking the decay of time, storms,\r\nand all circumstances and accidents together, is less than twenty years,\r\nevery navy must be renewed within that time; and France at the end of a\r\nfew years, can create and support a navy of double the extent of that of\r\nEngland; and the conduct of the English government will provoke her to\r\nit.\r\n\r\nBut of what use are navies otherwise than to make or prevent invasions?\r\nCommercially considered, they are losses. They scarcely give any\r\nprotection to the commerce of the countries which have them, compared\r\nwith the expense of maintaining them, and they insult the commerce of\r\nthe nations that are neutral.\r\n\r\nDuring the American war, the plan of the armed neutrality was formed and\r\nput in execution: but it was inconvenient, expensive, and ineffectual.\r\nThis being the case, the problem is, does not commerce contain within\r\nitself, the means of its own protection? It certainly does, if the\r\nneutral nations will employ that means properly.\r\n\r\nInstead then of an _armed neutrality_, the plan should be directly the\r\ncontrary. It should be an _unarmed neutrality_. In the first place,\r\nthe rights of neutral nations are easily defined. They are such as are\r\nexercised by nations in their intercourse with each other in time of\r\npeace, and which ought not, and cannot of right, be interrupted in\r\nconsequence of war breaking out between any two or more of them.\r\n\r\nTaking this as a principle, the next thing is to give it effect. The\r\nplan of the armed neutrality was to effect it by threatening war; but an\r\nunarmed neutrality can effect it by much easier and more powerful means.\r\n\r\nWere the neutral nations to associate, under an honourable injunction of\r\nfidelity to each other, and publicly declare to the world, that if any\r\nbelligerent power shall seize or molest any ship or vessel belonging\r\nto the citizens or subjects of any of the powers composing that\r\nAssociation, that the whole Association will shut its ports against the\r\nflag of the offending nation, and will not permit any goods, wares,\r\nor merchandise, produced or manufactured in the offending nation, or\r\nappertaining thereto, to be imported into any of the ports included in\r\nthe Association, until reparation be made to the injured party,--the\r\nreparation to be three times the value of the vessel and cargo,--and\r\nmoreover that all remittances on money, goods, and bills of exchange, do\r\ncease to be made to the offending nation, until the said reparation be\r\nmade: were the neutral nations only to do this, which it is their\r\ndirect interest to do, England, as a nation depending on the commerce of\r\nneutral nations in time of war, dare not molest them, and France would\r\nnot. But whilst, from the want of a common system, they individually\r\npermit England to do it, because individually they cannot resist it,\r\nthey put France under the necessity of doing the same thing. The supreme\r\nof all laws, in all cases, is that of self-preservation.\r\n\r\nAs the commerce of neutral nations would thus be protected by the means\r\nthat commerce naturally contains within itself, all the naval operations\r\nof France and England would be confined within the circle of acting\r\nagainst each other: and in that case it needs no spirit of prophecy to\r\ndiscover that France must finally prevail. The sooner this be done, the\r\nbetter will it be for both nations, and for all the world.\r\n\r\nThomas Paine.(1)\r\n\r\n     1 Paine had already prepared his \"Maritime Compact,\" and\r\n     devised the Rainbow Flag, which was to protect commerce, the\r\n     substance and history of which constitutes his Seventh\r\n     Letter to the People of the United States, Chapter XXXIII.\r\n     of the present volume. He sent the articles of his proposed\r\n     international Association to the Minister of Foreign\r\n     Relations, Talleyrand, who responded with a cordial letter.\r\n     The articles of \"Maritime Compact,\" translated into French\r\n     by Nicolas Bouneville, were, in 1800, sent to all the\r\n     Ministers of Foreign Affairs in Europe, and to the\r\n     ambassadors in Paris.--_Editor._,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXX. THE RECALL OF MONROE. (1)\r\n\r\n\r\n     1 Monroe, like Edmund Randolph and Thomas Paine, was\r\n     sacrificed to the new commercial alliance with Great\r\n     Britain. The Cabinet of Washington were entirely hostile to\r\n     France, and in their determination to replace Monroe were\r\n     assisted by Gouverneur Morris, still in Europe, who wrote to\r\n     President Washington calumnies against that Minister. In a\r\n     letter of December 19, 1795, Morris tells Washington that he\r\n     had heard from a trusted informant that Monroe had said to\r\n     several Frenchmen that \"he had no doubt but that, if they\r\n     would do what was proper here, he and his friends would turn\r\n     out Washington.\" On July 2, 1796, the Cabinet ministers,\r\n     Pickering, Wolcott, and Mo-Henry, wrote to the President\r\n     their joint opinion that the interests of the United States\r\n     required Monroe's recall, and slanderously connected him\r\n     with anonymous letters from France written by M.\r\n     Montflorence. The recall, dated August 22, 1796, reached\r\n     Monroe early in November. It alluded to certain \"concurring\r\n     circumstances,\" which induced his removal, and these \"hidden\r\n     causes\" (in Paine's phrase) Monroe vainly demanded on his\r\n     return to America early in 1797. The Directory, on\r\n     notification of Monroe's recall, resolved not to recognize\r\n     his successor, and the only approach to an American Minister\r\n     in Paris for the remainder of the century was Thomas Paine,\r\n     who was consulted by the Foreign Ministers, De la Croix and\r\n     Talleyrand, and by Napoleon. On the approach of C. C.\r\n     Pinckney, as successor to Monroe, Paine feared that his\r\n     dismissal might entail war, and urged the Minister (De la\r\n     Croix) to regard Pinckney,--nominated in a recess of the\r\n     Senate,--as in \"suspension\" until confirmed by that body.\r\n     There might be unofficial \"pourparlers,\" with him. This\r\n     letter (State Archives, Paris, États Unis, vol. 46, fol. 425)\r\n     was considered for several days before Pinckney reached\r\n     Paris (December 5, 1796), but the Directory considered that\r\n     it was not a \"dignified\" course, and Pinckney was ordered to\r\n     leave French territory, under the existing decree against\r\n     foreigners who had no permit to remain.--_Editor._.\r\n\r\n\r\nParis, Sept. 27, 1797. Editors of the Bien-in formé.\r\n\r\nCitizens: in your 19th number of the complementary 5th, you gave an\r\nanalysis of the letters of James Monroe to Timothy Pickering. The\r\nnewspapers of Paris and the departments have copied this correspondence\r\nbetween the ambassador of the United States and the Secretary of State.\r\nI notice, however, that a few of them have omitted some important facts,\r\nwhilst indulging in comments of such an extraordinary nature that it is\r\nclear they know neither Monroe's integrity nor the intrigues of Pitt in\r\nthis affair.\r\n\r\nThe recall of Monroe is connected with circumstances so important to the\r\ninterests of France and the United States, that we must be careful not\r\nto confound it with the recall of an ordinary individual. The Washington\r\nfaction had affected to spread it abroad that James Monroe was the cause\r\nof rupture between the two Republics. This accusation is a perfidious\r\nand calumnious one; since the main point in this affair is not so much\r\nthe recall of a worthy, enlightened and republican minister, as\r\nthe ingratitude and clandestine manoeuvering of the government of\r\nWashington, who caused the misunderstanding by signing a treaty\r\ninjurious to the French Republic.\r\n\r\nJames Monroe, in his letters, does not deny the right of government to\r\nwithdraw its confidence from any one of its delegates, representatives,\r\nor agents. He has hinted, it is true, that caprice and temper are not\r\nin accordance with the spirit of paternal rule, and that whenever a\r\nrepresentative government punishes or rewards, good faith, integrity and\r\njustice should replace _the good pleasure of Kings_.\r\n\r\nIn the present case, they have done more than recall an agent. Had they\r\nconfined themselves to depriving him of his appointment, James Monroe\r\nwould have kept silence; but he has been accused of lighting the torch\r\nof discord in both Republics. The refutation of this absurd and infamous\r\nreproach is the chief object of his correspondence. If he did not\r\nimmediately complain of these slanders in his letters of the 6th and\r\n8th [July], it is because he wished to use at first a certain degree of\r\ncaution, and, if it were possible, to stifle intestine troubles at\r\ntheir birth. He wished to reopen the way to peaceful negotiations to be\r\nconducted with good faith and justice.\r\n\r\nThe arguments of the Secretary of State on the rights of the supreme\r\nadministration of the United States are peremptory; but the observations\r\nof Monroe on the hidden causes of his recall are touching; they come\r\nfrom the heart; they are characteristic of an excellent citizen. If he\r\ndoes more than complain of his unjust recall as a man of feeling would;\r\nif he proudly asks for proofs of a grave accusation, it is after he has\r\ntried in vain every honest and straightforward means. He will not suffer\r\nthat a government, sold to the enemies of freedom, should discharge upon\r\nhim its shame, its crimes, its ingratitude, and all the odium of its\r\nunjust dealings.\r\n\r\nWere Monroe to find himself an object of public hatred, the Republican\r\nparty in the United States, that party which is the sincere ally\r\nof France, would be annihilated, and this is the aim of the English\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nImagine the triumph of Pitt, if Monroe and the other friends of freedom\r\nin America, should be unjustly attacked in France!\r\n\r\nMonroe does not lay his cause before the Senate since the Senate\r\nitself ratified the unconstitutional treaty; he appeals to the house of\r\nRepresentatives, and at the same time lays his cause before the upright\r\ntribunal of the American nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXI. PRIVATE LETTER TO PRESIDENT JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nParis, October 1, 1800.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--I wrote to you from Havre by the ship Dublin Packet in the\r\nyear 1797. It was then my intention to return to America; but there were\r\nso many British frigates cruising in sight of the port, and which after\r\na few days knew that I was at Havre waiting to go to America, that I did\r\nnot think it best to trust myself to their discretion, and the more so,\r\nas I had no confidence in the captain of the Dublin Packet (Clay).(1) I\r\nmentioned to you in that letter, which I believe you received thro'\r\nthe hands of Colonel [Aaron] Burr, that I was glad since you were not\r\nPresident that you had accepted the nomination of Vice President.\r\n\r\nThe Commissioners Ellsworth & Co.(2) have been here about eight months,\r\nand three more useless mortals never came upon public business. Their\r\npresence appears to me to have been rather an injury than a benefit.\r\nThey set themselves up for a faction as soon as they arrived. I was then\r\nin Belgia.(3) Upon my return to Paris I learnt they had made a point of\r\nnot returning the visits of Mr. Skipwith and Barlow, because, they said,\r\nthey had not the confidence of the executive. Every known republican was\r\ntreated in the same manner. I learned from Mr. Miller of Philadelphia,\r\nwho had occasion to see them upon business, that they did not intend\r\nto return my visit, if I made one. This, I supposed, it was intended I\r\nshould know, that I might not make one. It had the contrary effect. I\r\nwent to see Mr. Ellsworth. I told him, I did not come to see him as a\r\ncommissioner, nor to congratulate him upon his mission; that I came to\r\nsee him because I had formerly known him in Congress. \"I mean not,\"\r\nsaid I, \"to press you with any questions, or to engage you in\r\nany conversation upon the business you are come upon, but I will\r\nnevertheless candidly say that I know not what expectations the\r\nGovernment or the people of America may have of your mission, or what\r\nexpectations you may have yourselves, but I believe you will find you\r\ncan do but little. The treaty with England lies at the threshold of all\r\nyour business. The American Government never did two more foolish things\r\nthan when it signed that Treaty and recalled Mr. Monroe, who was the\r\nonly man could do them any service.\" Mr. Ellsworth put on the dull\r\ngravity of a Judge, and was silent. I added, \"You may perhaps make a\r\ntreaty like that you have made with England, which is a surrender of the\r\nrights of the American flag; for the principle that neutral ships make\r\nneutral property must be general or not at all.\" I then changed the\r\nsubject, for I had all the talk to myself upon this topic, and enquired\r\nafter Samuel Adams, (I asked nothing about John,) Mr. Jefferson, Mr.\r\nMonroe, and others of my friends; and the melancholy case of the yellow\r\nfever,--of which he gave me as circumstantial an account as if he had\r\nbeen summing up a case to a Jury. Here my visit ended, and had Mr.\r\nEllsworth been as cunning as a statesman, or as wise as a Judge, he\r\nwould have returned my visit that he might appear insensible of the\r\nintention of mine.\r\n\r\n     1 The packet was indeed searched for Paine by a British\r\n     cruiser.--_Editor._\r\n\r\n     2 Oliver Ellsworth (Chief Justice), W. V. Murray, and W. R.\r\n     Davie, were sent by President Adams to France to negotiate a\r\n     treaty. In this they failed, but a convention was signed\r\n     September 30, 1800, which terminated the treaty of 1778,\r\n     which had become a source of discord, and prepared the way\r\n     for the negotiations of Livingston and Monroe in 1803.--\r\n     _Editor._\r\n\r\n     3 Paine had visited his room-mate in Luxembourg prison,\r\n     Vanhuele, who was now Mayor of Bruges.--_Editor._.\r\n\r\nI now come to the affairs of this country and of Europe. You will, I\r\nsuppose, have heard before this arrives to you, of the battle of\r\nMarengo in Italy, where the Austrians were defeated--of the armistice\r\nin consequence thereof, and the surrender of Milan, Genoa etc. to\r\nthe french--of the successes of the french Army in Germany--and the\r\nextension of the armistice in that quarter--of the preliminaries of\r\nPeace signed at Paris--of the refusal of the Emperor [of Austria] to\r\nratify these preliminaries--of the breaking of the armistice by the\r\nfrench Government in consequence of that refusal--of the \"gallant\"\r\nexpedition of the Emperor to put himself at the head of his Army--of his\r\npompous arrival there--of his having made his will--of prayers being put\r\nin all his churches for the preservation of the life of this Hero--of\r\nGeneral Moreau announcing to him, immediately on his arrival at the\r\nArmy, that hostilities would commence the day after the next at sunrise\r\nunless he signed the treaty or gave security that he would sign within\r\n45 days--of his surrendering up three of the principal keys of Germany\r\n(Ulm, Philipsbourg, and Ingolstadt) as security that he would sign them.\r\nThis is the state things are now in, at the time of writing this letter;\r\nbut it is proper to add that the refusal of the Emperor to sign the\r\npreliminaries was motived upon a note from the King of England to be\r\nadmitted to the Congress for negociating Peace, which was consented to\r\nby the french upon the condition of an armistice at Sea, which England,\r\nbefore knowing of the surrender the Emperor had made, had refused. From\r\nall which it appears to me, judging from circumstances, that the Emperor\r\nis now so compleatly in the hands of the french, that he has no way of\r\ngetting out but by a peace. The Congress for the peace is to be held\r\nat Lunéville, a town in France. Since the affair of Rastadt the French\r\ncommissioners will not trust themselves within the Emperor's territory.\r\n\r\nI now come to domestic Affairs. I know not what the Commissioners have\r\ndone, but from a paper I enclose to you, which appears to have\r\nsome authority, it is not much. The paper as you will perceive is\r\nconsiderably prior to this letter. I know that the Commissioners before\r\nthis piece appeared intended setting off. It is therefore probable that\r\nwhat they have done is conformable to what this paper mentions, which\r\ncertainly will not atone for the expence their mission has incurred,\r\nneither are they, by all the accounts I hear of them, men fitted for the\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\nBut independently of these matters there appears to be a state of\r\ncircumstances rising, which if it goes on, will render all partial\r\ntreaties unnecessary. In the first place I doubt if any peace will be\r\nmade with England; and in the second place, I should not wonder to see a\r\ncoalition formed against her, to compel her to abandon her insolence on\r\nthe seas. This brings me to speak of the manuscripts I send you.\r\n\r\nThe piece No. I, without any title, was written in consequence of a\r\nquestion put to me by Bonaparte. As he supposed I knew England and\r\nEnglish Politics he sent a person to me to ask, that in case of\r\nnegociating a Peace with Austria, whether it would be proper to include\r\nEngland. This was when Count St. Julian was in Paris, on the part of the\r\nEmperor negociating the preliminaries:--which as I have before said the\r\nEmperor refused to sign on the pretence of admitting England.\r\n\r\nThe piece No. 2, entitled _On the Jacobinism of the English at sea_, was\r\nwritten when the English made their insolent and impolitic expedition to\r\nDenmark, and is also an auxiliary to the politic of No. I. I shewed it\r\nto a friend [Bonneville] who had it translated into french, and printed\r\nin the form of a Pamphlet, and distributed gratis among the foreign\r\nMinisters, and persons in the Government. It was immediately copied\r\ninto several of the french Journals, and into the official Paper, the\r\nMoniteur. It appeared in this paper one day before the last dispatch\r\narrived from Egypt; which agreed perfectly with what I had said\r\nrespecting Egypt. It hit the two cases of Denmark and Egypt in the exact\r\nproper moment.\r\n\r\nThe Piece No. 3, entitled _Compact Maritime_, is the sequel of No. 2,\r\ndigested in form. It is translating at the time I write this letter,\r\nand I am to have a meeting with the Senator Garat upon the subject.\r\nThe pieces 2 and 3 go off in manuscript to England, by a confidential\r\nperson, where they will be published.(1)\r\n\r\n     1 The substance of most of these \"pieces\" are embodied in\r\n     Paine's Seventh Letter to the People of the United States\r\n     (infra p. 420).--_Editor._\r\n\r\nBy all the news we get from the North there appears to be something\r\nmeditating against England. It is now given for certain that Paul has\r\nembargoed all the English vessels and English property in Russia till\r\nsome principle be established for protecting the Rights of neutral\r\nNations, and securing the liberty of the Seas. The preparations in\r\nDenmark continue, notwithstanding the convention that she has made with\r\nEngland, which leaves the question with respect to the right set up by\r\nEngland to stop and search Neutral vessels undecided. I send you the\r\nparagraphs upon the subject.\r\n\r\nThe tumults are great in all parts of England on account of the\r\nexcessive price of corn and bread, which has risen since the harvest.\r\nI attribute it more to the abundant increase of paper, and the\r\nnon-circulation of cash, than to any other cause. People in trade\r\ncan push the paper off as fast as they receive it, as they did by\r\ncontinental money in America; but as farmers have not this opportunity,\r\nthey endeavor to secure themselves by going considerably in advance.\r\n\r\nI have now given you all the great articles of intelligence, for I\r\ntrouble not myself with little ones, and consequently not with the\r\nCommissioners, nor any thing they are about, nor with John Adams,\r\notherwise than to wish him safe home, and a better and wiser man in his\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nIn the present state of circumstances and the prospects arising from\r\nthem, it may be proper for America to consider whether it is worth her\r\nwhile to enter into any treaty at this moment, or to wait the event of\r\nthose circumstances which if they go on will render partial treaties\r\nuseless by deranging them. But if, in the mean time, she enters into\r\nany treaty it ought to be with a condition to the following purpose:\r\nReserving to herself the right of joining in an Association of Nations\r\nfor the protection of the Rights of Neutral Commerce and the security of\r\nthe liberty of the Seas.\r\n\r\nThe pieces 2, 3, may go to the press. They will make a small pamphlet\r\nand the printers are welcome to put my name to it. (It is best it should\r\nbe put.) From thence they will get into the newspapers. I know that the\r\nfaction of John Adams abuses me pretty heartily. They are welcome.\r\n\r\nIt does not disturb me, and they lose their labour; and in return for\r\nit I am doing America more service, as a neutral Nation, than their\r\nexpensive Commissioners can do, and she has that service from me for\r\nnothing. The piece No. 1 is only for your own amusement and that of your\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\nI come now to speak confidentially to you on a private subject. When Mr.\r\nEllsworth and Davie return to America, Murray will return to Holland,\r\nand in that case there will be nobody in Paris but Mr. Skipwith that\r\nhas been in the habit of transacting business with the french Government\r\nsince the revolution began. He is on a good standing with them, and if\r\nthe chance of the day should place you in the presidency you cannot do\r\nbetter than appoint him for any purpose you may have occasion for in\r\nFrance. He is an honest man and will do his country justice, and that\r\nwith civility and good manners to the government he is commissioned to\r\nact with; a faculty which that Northern Bear Timothy Pickering wanted,\r\nand which the Bear of that Bear, John Adams, never possessed.\r\n\r\nI know not much of Mr. Murray, otherwise than of his unfriendliness to\r\nevery American who is not of his faction, but I am sure that Joel Barlow\r\nis a much fitter man to be in Holland than Mr. Murray. It is upon\r\nthe fitness of the man to the place that I speak, for I have not\r\ncommunicated a thought upon the subject to Barlow, neither does he\r\nknow, at the time of my writing this (for he is at Havre), that I have\r\nintention to do it.\r\n\r\nI will now, by way of relief, amuse you with some account of the\r\nprogress of iron bridges.\r\n\r\n[Here follows an account of the building of the iron bridge at\r\nSunderland, England, and some correspondence with Mr. Milbanke, M. P.,\r\nwhich will be given more fully and precisely in a chapter of vol. IV.\r\n(Appendix), on Iron Bridges, and is therefore omitted here.]\r\n\r\nI have now made two other Models [of bridges]. One is pasteboard, five\r\nfeet span and five inches of height from the cords. It is in the opinion\r\nof every person who has seen it one of the most beautiful objects the\r\neye can behold. I then cast a model in metal following the construction\r\nof that in paste-board and of the same dimensions. The whole was\r\nexecuted in my own Chamber. It is far superior in strength, elegance,\r\nand readiness in execution to the model I made in America, and which you\r\nsaw in Paris.(1) I shall bring those models with me when I come\r\nhome, which will be as soon as I can pass the seas in safety from the\r\npiratical John Bulls. I suppose you have seen, or have heard of the\r\nBishop of Landaff's answer to my second part of the Age of Reason. As\r\nsoon as I got a copy of it I began a third part, which served also as an\r\nanswer to the Bishop; but as soon as the clerical society for promoting\r\n_Christian Knowledge_ knew of my intention to answer the Bishop, they\r\nprosecuted, as a Society, the printer of the first and second parts, to\r\nprevent that answer appearing. No other reason than this can be assigned\r\nfor their prosecuting at the time they did, because the first part had\r\nbeen in circulation above three years and the second part more than one,\r\nand they prosecuted immediately on knowing that I was taking up their\r\nChampion. The Bishop's answer, like Mr. Burke's attack on the french\r\nrevolution, served me as a back-ground to bring forward other subjects\r\nupon, with more advantage than if the background was not there. This is\r\nthe motive that induced me to answer him, otherwise I should have gone\r\non without taking any notice of him. I have made and am still making\r\nadditions to the manuscript, and shall continue to do so till an\r\nopportunity arrive for publishing it.\r\n\r\n     1 \"These models exhibit an extraordinary degree not only of\r\n     skill, but of taste, and are wrought with extreme delicacy\r\n     entirely by his own hands. The largest is nearly four feet\r\n     in length; the iron-works, the chains, and every other\r\n     article belonging to it, were forged and manufactured by\r\n     himself. It is intended as the model of a bridge which is to\r\n     be constructed across the Delaware, extending 480 feet, with\r\n     only one arch. The other is to be erected over a lesser\r\n     river, whose name I forget, and is likewise a single arch,\r\n     and of his own workmanship, excepting the chains, which,\r\n     instead of iron, are cut out of paste-hoard by the fair hand\r\n     of his correspondent, the 'Little Corner of the World' (Lady\r\n     Smyth), whose indefatigable perseverance is extraordinary.\r\n     He was offered £3000 for these models and refused it.\"--\r\n     Yorke's _Letters from France_, These models excited much\r\n     admiration in Washington and Philadelphia. They remained for\r\n     a long time in Peale's Museum at Philadelphia, but no trace\r\n     is left of them.--_Editor._\r\n\r\nIf any American frigate should come to france, and the direction of\r\nit fall to you, I will be glad you would give me the opportunity of\r\nreturning. The abscess under which I suffered almost two years is\r\nentirely healed of itself, and I enjoy exceeding good health. This is\r\nthe first of October, and Mr. Skipwith has just called to tell me the\r\nCommissioners set off for Havre to-morrow. This will go by the frigate\r\nbut not with the knowledge of the Commissioners. Remember me with much\r\naffection to my friends and accept the same to yourself.\r\n\r\nThomas Paine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXII. PROPOSAL THAT LOUISIANA BE PURCHASED.(1)\r\n\r\n\r\n(SENT TO THE PRESIDENT, CHRISTMAS DAY, 1802.)\r\n\r\n     1 Paine, being at Lovell's Hotel, Washington, suggested the\r\n     purchase of Louisiana to Dr. Michael Leib, representative\r\n     from Pennsylvania, who, being pleased with the idea,\r\n     suggested that he should write it to Jefferson. On the day\r\n     after its reception the President told Paine that \"measures\r\n     were already taken in that business.\"--_Editor._.\r\n\r\nSpain has ceded Louisiana to France, and France has excluded Americans\r\nfrom New Orleans, and the navigation of the Mississippi. The people of\r\nthe Western Territory have complained of it to their Government, and the\r\nGovernment is of consequence involved and interested in the affair. The\r\nquestion then is--What is the best step to be taken?\r\n\r\nThe one is to begin by memorial and remonstrance against an infraction\r\nof a right. The other is by accommodation,--still keeping the right in\r\nview, but not making it a groundwork.\r\n\r\nSuppose then the Government begin by making a proposal to France to\r\nre-purchase the cession made to her by Spain, of Louisiana, provided it\r\nbe with the consent of the people of Louisiana, or a majority thereof.\r\n\r\nBy beginning on this ground any thing can be said without carrying the\r\nappearance of a threat. The growing power of the Western Territory can\r\nbe stated as a matter of information, and also the impossibility\r\nof restraining them from seizing upon New Orleans, and the equal\r\nimpossibility of France to prevent it.\r\n\r\nSuppose the proposal attended to, the sum to be given comes next on\r\nthe carpet. This, on the part of America, will be estimated between the\r\nvalue of the commerce and the quantity of revenue that Louisiana will\r\nproduce.\r\n\r\nThe French Treasury is not only empty, but the Government has consumed\r\nby anticipation a great part of the next year's revenue. A monied\r\nproposal will, I believe, be attended to; if it should, the claims upon\r\nFrance can be stipulated as part of the payment, and that sum can be\r\npaid here to the claimants.\r\n\r\n----I congratulate you on _The Birthday of the New Sun_,\r\n\r\nnow called Christmas Day; and I make you a present of a thought on\r\nLouisiana.\r\n\r\nT.P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXIII. THOMAS PAINE TO THE CITIZENS OF THE UNITED STATES,\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd particularly to the Leaders of the Federal Faction, LETTER I.(1)\r\n\r\n     1 The National Intelligencer, November 15th. The venerable\r\n     Mr. Gales, so long associated with this paper, had been in\r\n     youth a prosecuted adherent of Paine in Sheffield, England.\r\n     The paper distinguished itself by the kindly welcome it gave\r\n     Paine on his return to America. (See issues of Nov. 3 and\r\n     10, 1802.) Paine landed at Baltimore, Oct. 30th.--_Editor._,\r\n\r\nAfter an absence of almost fifteen years, I am again returned to the\r\ncountry in whose dangers I bore my share, and to whose greatness I\r\ncontributed my part.\r\n\r\nWhen I sailed for Europe, in the spring of 1787, it was my intention to\r\nreturn to America the next year, and enjoy in retirement the esteem of\r\nmy friends, and the repose I was entitled to. I had stood out the storm\r\nof one revolution, and had no wish to embark in another. But other\r\nscenes and other circumstances than those of contemplated ease were\r\nallotted to me. The French revolution was beginning to germinate when I\r\narrived in France. The principles of it were good, they were copied\r\nfrom America, and the men who conducted it were honest. But the fury of\r\nfaction soon extinguished the one, and sent the other to the scaffold.\r\nOf those who began that revolution, I am almost the only survivor,\r\nand that through a thousand dangers. I owe this not to the prayers of\r\npriests, nor to the piety of hypocrites, but to the continued protection\r\nof Providence.\r\n\r\nBut while I beheld with pleasure the dawn of liberty rising in Europe,\r\nI saw with regret the lustre of it fading in America. In less than two\r\nyears from the time of my departure some distant symptoms painfully\r\nsuggested the idea that the principles of the revolution were expiring\r\non the soil that produced them. I received at that time a letter from a\r\nfemale literary correspondent, and in my answer to her, I expressed my\r\nfears on that head.(1)\r\n\r\nI now know from the information I obtain upon the spot, that the\r\nimpressions that then distressed me, for I was proud of America, were\r\nbut too well founded. She was turning her back on her own glory, and\r\nmaking hasty strides in the retrograde path of oblivion. But a spark\r\nfrom the altar of _Seventy-six_, unextinguished and unextinguishable\r\nthrough the long night of error, is again lighting up, in every part of\r\nthe Union, the genuine name of rational liberty.\r\n\r\nAs the French revolution advanced, it fixed the attention of the world,\r\nand drew from the pensioned pen (2) of Edmund Burke a furious attack.\r\nThis brought me once more on the public theatre of politics, and\r\noccasioned the pamphlet _Rights of Man_. It had the greatest run of\r\nany work ever published in the English language. The number of copies\r\ncirculated in England, Scotland, and Ireland, besides translations\r\ninto foreign languages, was between four and five hundred thousand. The\r\nprinciples of that work were the same as those in _Common Sense_, and\r\nthe effects would have been the same in England as that had produced in\r\nAmerica, could the vote of the nation been quietly taken, or had equal\r\nopportunities of consulting or acting existed. The only difference\r\nbetween the two works was, that the one was adapted to the local\r\ncircumstances of England, and the other to those of America. As to\r\nmyself, I acted in both cases alike; I relinquished to the people of\r\nEngland, as I had done to those of America, all profits from the work.\r\nMy reward existed in the ambition to do good, and the independent\r\nhappiness of my own mind.\r\n\r\n     1 Paine here quotes a passage from his letter to Mrs. Few,\r\n     already given in the Memorial to Monroe (XXI.). The entire\r\n     letter to Mrs. Few will be printed in the Appendix to Vol.\r\n     IV. of this work.--_Editor._\r\n\r\n     2 See editorial note p. 95 in this volume.--_Editor._\r\n\r\nBut a faction, acting in disguise, was rising in America; they had lost\r\nsight of first principles. They were beginning to contemplate government\r\nas a profitable monopoly, and the people as hereditary property. It\r\nis, therefore, no wonder that the _Rights of Man_ was attacked by that\r\nfaction, and its author continually abused. But let them go on; give\r\nthem rope enough and they will put an end to their own insignificance.\r\nThere is too much common sense and independence in America to be long\r\nthe dupe of any faction, foreign or domestic.\r\n\r\nBut, in the midst of the freedom we enjoy, the licentiousness of the\r\npapers called Federal, (and I know not why they are called so, for they\r\nare in their principles anti-federal and despotic,) is a dishonour\r\nto the character of the country, and an injury to its reputation\r\nand importance abroad. They represent the whole people of America as\r\ndestitute of public principle and private manners. As to any injury they\r\ncan do at home to those whom they abuse, or service they can render\r\nto those who employ them, it is to be set down to the account of\r\nnoisy nothingness. It is on themselves the disgrace recoils, for the\r\nreflection easily presents itself to every thinking mind, that _those\r\nwho abuse liberty when they possess it would abuse power could they\r\nobtain it_; and, therefore, they may as well take as a general motto,\r\nfor all such papers, _We and our patrons are not fit to be trusted with\r\npower_.\r\n\r\nThere is in America, more than in any other country, a large body\r\nof people who attend quietly to their farms, or follow their several\r\noccupations; who pay no regard to the clamours of anonymous scribblers,\r\nwho think for themselves, and judge of government, not by the fury of\r\nnewspaper writers, but by the prudent frugality of its measures, and the\r\nencouragement it gives to the improvement and prosperity of the country;\r\nand who, acting on their own judgment, never come forward in an election\r\nbut on some important occasion. When this body moves, all the little\r\nbarkings of scribbling and witless curs pass for nothing. To say to this\r\nindependent description of men, \"You must turn out such and such persons\r\nat the next election, for they have taken off a great many taxes, and\r\nlessened the expenses of government, they have dismissed my son, or my\r\nbrother, or myself, from a lucrative office, in which there was nothing\r\nto do\"--is to show the cloven foot of faction, and preach the language\r\nof ill-disguised mortification. In every part of the Union, this faction\r\nis in the agonies of death, and in proportion as its fate approaches,\r\ngnashes its teeth and struggles. My arrival has struck it as with an\r\nhydrophobia, it is like the sight of water to canine madness.\r\n\r\nAs this letter is intended to announce my arrival to my friends, and to\r\nmy enemies if I have any, for I ought to have none in America, and as\r\nintroductory to others that will occasionally follow, I shall close it\r\nby detailing the line of conduct I shall pursue.\r\n\r\nI have no occasion to ask, and do not intend to accept, any place or\r\noffice in the government.(1) There is none it could give me that would\r\nbe any ways equal to the profits I could make as an author, for I have\r\nan established fame in the literary world, could I reconcile it to my\r\nprinciples to make money by my politics or religion. I must be in every\r\nthing what I have ever been, a disinterested volunteer; my proper sphere\r\nof action is on the common floor of citizenship, and to honest men I\r\ngive my hand and my heart freely.\r\n\r\n     1 The President (Jefferson) being an intimate friend of\r\n     Paine, and suspected, despite his reticence, of sympathizing\r\n     with Paine's religions views, was included in the\r\n     denunciations of Paine (\"The Two Toms\" they were called),\r\n     and Paine here goes out of his way to soften matters for\r\n     Jefferson.--_Editor._.\r\n\r\nI have some manuscript works to publish, of which I shall give proper\r\nnotice, and some mechanical affairs to bring forward, that will employ\r\nall my leisure time. I shall continue these letters as I see occasion,\r\nand as to the low party prints that choose to abuse me, they are\r\nwelcome; I shall not descend to answer them. I have been too much used\r\nto such common stuff to take any notice of it. The government of England\r\nhonoured me with a thousand martyrdoms, by burning me in effigy in every\r\ntown in that country, and their hirelings in America may do the same.\r\n\r\nCity of Washington.\r\n\r\nTHOMAS PAINE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER II(1)\r\n\r\nAs the affairs of the country to which I am returned are of more\r\nimportance to the world, and to me, than of that I have lately left,\r\n(for it is through the new world the old must be regenerated, if\r\nregenerated at all,) I shall not take up the time of the reader with an\r\naccount of scenes that have passed in France, many of which are painful\r\nto remember and horrid to relate, but come at once to the circumstances\r\nin which I find America on my arrival.\r\n\r\nFourteen years, and something more, have produced a change, at least\r\namong a part of the people, and I ask my-self what it is? I meet or hear\r\nof thousands of my former connexions, who are men of the same principles\r\nand friendships as when I left them. But a non-descript race, and of\r\nequivocal generation, assuming the name of _Federalist_,--a name that\r\ndescribes no character of principle good or bad, and may equally\r\nbe applied to either,--has since started up with the rapidity of a\r\nmushroom, and like a mushroom is withering on its rootless stalk. Are\r\nthose men _federalized_ to support the liberties of their country or to\r\noverturn them? To add to its fair fame or riot on its spoils? The\r\nname contains no defined idea. It is like John Adams's definition of a\r\nRepublic, in his letter to Mr. Wythe of Virginia.(2) _It is_, says he,\r\n_an empire of laws and not of men_. But as laws may be bad as well as\r\ngood, an empire of laws may be the best of all governments or the worst\r\nof all tyrannies. But John Adams is a man of paradoxical heresies, and\r\nconsequently of a bewildered mind. He wrote a book entitled, \"_A Defence\r\nof the American Constitutions_,\" and the principles of it are an attack\r\nupon them. But the book is descended to the tomb of forgetfulness, and\r\nthe best fortune that can attend its author is quietly to follow its\r\nfate. John was not born for immortality. But, to return to Federalism.\r\n\r\n     1 National Intelligencer, Nov. 23d, 1802.--_Editor._\r\n\r\n     2 Chancellor Wythe, 1728-1806.--_Editor._ vol m--«5\r\n\r\nIn the history of parties and the names they assume, it often happens\r\nthat they finish by the direct contrary principles with which they\r\nprofess to begin, and thus it has happened with Federalism.\r\n\r\nDuring the time of the old Congress, and prior to the establishment of\r\nthe federal government, the continental belt was too loosely buckled.\r\nThe several states were united in name but not in fact, and that nominal\r\nunion had neither centre nor circle. The laws of one state frequently\r\ninterferred with, and sometimes opposed, those of another. Commerce\r\nbetween state and state was without protection, and confidence without\r\na point to rest on. The condition the country was then in, was aptly\r\ndescribed by Pelatiah Webster, when he said, \"_thirteen staves and ne'er\r\na hoop will not make a barrel_.\"(1)\r\n\r\nIf, then, by _Federalist_ is to be understood one who was for cementing\r\nthe Union by a general government operating equally over all the States,\r\nin all matters that embraced the common interest, and to which the\r\nauthority of the States severally was not adequate, for no one State\r\ncan make laws to bind another; if, I say, by a _Federalist_ is meant\r\na person of this description, (and this is the origin of the name,) _I\r\nought to stand first on the list of Federalists_, for the proposition\r\nfor establishing a general government over the Union, came originally\r\nfrom me in 1783, in a written Memorial to Chancellor Livingston, then\r\nSecretary for Foreign Affairs to Congress, Robert Morris, Minister\r\nof Finance, and his associate, Gouverneur Morris, all of whom are now\r\nliving; and we had a dinner and conference at Robert Morris's on the\r\nsubject. The occasion was as follows:\r\n\r\nCongress had proposed a duty of five per cent, on imported articles, the\r\nmoney to be applied as a fund towards paying the interest of loans to\r\nbe borrowed in Holland. The resolve was sent to the several States to\r\nbe enacted into a law. Rhode Island absolutely refused. I was at\r\nthe trouble of a journey to Rhode Island to reason with them on the\r\nsubject.(2) Some other of the States enacted it with alterations, each\r\none as it pleased. Virginia adopted it, and afterwards repealed it, and\r\nthe affair came to nothing.\r\n\r\n     1 \"Like a stare in a cask well bound with hoops, it [the\r\n     individual State] stands firmer, is not so easily shaken,\r\n     bent, or broken, as it would be were it set up by itself\r\n     alone.\"--Pelatiah Webster, 1788. See Paul L. Ford's\r\n     Pamphlets cm the Constitution, etc., p. 128.--Editor\r\n\r\n     2  See my \"Life of Paine.\" vol i., p. 103.--Editor,\r\n\r\nIt was then visible, at least to me, that either Congress must frame the\r\nlaws necessary for the Union, and send them to the several States to be\r\nenregistered without any alteration, which would in itself appear like\r\nusurpation on one part and passive obedience on the other, or some\r\nmethod must be devised to accomplish the same end by constitutional\r\nprinciples; and the proposition I made in the memorial was, to _add\r\na continental legislature to Congress, to be elected by the several\r\nStates_. The proposition met the full approbation of the gentlemen to\r\nwhom it was addressed, and the conversation turned on the manner of\r\nbringing it forward. Gouverneur Morris, in walking with me after dinner,\r\nwished me to throw out the idea in the newspaper; I replied, that I did\r\nnot like to be always the proposer of new things, that it would have too\r\nassuming an appearance; and besides, that _I did not think the country\r\nwas quite wrong enough to be put right_. I remember giving the same\r\nreason to Dr. Rush, at Philadelphia, and to General Gates, at whose\r\nquarters I spent a day on my return from Rhode Island; and I suppose\r\nthey will remember it, because the observation seemed to strike them.(1)\r\n\r\n     1 The Letter Books of Robert Morris (16 folio volumes, which\r\n     should be in our national Archives) contain many entries\r\n     relating to Paine's activity in the public service. Under\r\n     date Aug. 21, 1783, about the time referred to by Paine in\r\n     this letter, Robert Morris mentions a conversation with him\r\n     on public affairs. I am indebted to General Meredith Read,\r\n     owner of these Morris papers, for permission to examine\r\n     them.--_Editor._.\r\n\r\nBut the embarrassments increasing, as they necessarily must from the\r\nwant of a better cemented union, the State of Virginia proposed holding\r\na commercial convention, and that convention, which was not sufficiently\r\nnumerous, proposed that another convention, with more extensive and\r\nbetter defined powers, should be held at Philadelphia, May 10, 1787.\r\n\r\nWhen the plan of the Federal Government, formed by this Convention, was\r\nproposed and submitted to the consideration of the several States, it\r\nwas strongly objected to in each of them. But the objections were not on\r\nanti-federal grounds, but on constitutional points. Many were shocked\r\nat the idea of placing what is called Executive Power in the hands of a\r\nsingle individual. To them it had too much the form and appearance of a\r\nmilitary government, or a despotic one. Others objected that the\r\npowers given to a president were too great, and that in the hands of\r\nan ambitious and designing man it might grow into tyranny, as it did\r\nin England under Oliver Cromwell, and as it has since done in France.\r\nA Republic must not only be so in its principles, but in its forms. The\r\nExecutive part of the Federal government was made for a man, and those\r\nwho consented, against their judgment, to place Executive Power in the\r\nhands of a single individual, reposed more on the supposed moderation of\r\nthe person they had in view, than on the wisdom of the measure itself.\r\n\r\nTwo considerations, however, overcame all objections. The one was, the\r\nabsolute necessity of a Federal Government. The other, the rational\r\nreflection, that as government in America is founded on the\r\nrepresentative system any error in the first essay could be reformed\r\nby the same quiet and rational process by which the Constitution was\r\nformed, and that either by the generation then living, or by those who\r\nwere to succeed. If ever America lose sight of this principle, she will\r\nno longer be the _land of liberty_. The father will become the assassin\r\nof the rights of the son, and his descendants be a race of slaves.\r\n\r\nAs many thousands who were minors are grown up to manhood since the name\r\nof _Federalist_ began, it became necessary, for their information, to\r\ngo back and show the origin of the name, which is now no longer what it\r\noriginally was; but it was the more necessary to do this, in order to\r\nbring forward, in the open face of day, the apostacy of those who first\r\ncalled themselves Federalists.\r\n\r\nTo them it served as a cloak for treason, a mask for tyranny. Scarcely\r\nwere they placed in the seat of power and office, than Federalism was to\r\nbe destroyed, and the representative system of government, the pride\r\nand glory of America, and the palladium of her liberties, was to be\r\noverthrown and abolished. The next generation was not to be free. The\r\nson was to bend his neck beneath the father's foot, and live, deprived\r\nof his rights, under hereditary control. Among the men of this apostate\r\ndescription, is to be ranked the ex-president _John Adams_. It has been\r\nthe political career of this man to begin with hypocrisy, proceed with\r\narrogance, and finish in contempt. May such be the fate of all such\r\ncharacters.\r\n\r\nI have had doubts of John Adams ever since the year 1776. In a\r\nconversation with me at that time, concerning the pamphlet _Common\r\nSense_, he censured it because it attacked the English form of\r\ngovernment. John was for independence because he expected to be made\r\ngreat by it; but it was not difficult to perceive, for the surliness of\r\nhis temper makes him an awkward hypocrite, that his head was as full of\r\nkings, queens, and knaves, as a pack of cards. But John has lost deal.\r\n\r\nWhen a man has a concealed project in his brain that he wants to bring\r\nforward, and fears will not succeed, he begins with it as physicians\r\ndo by suspected poison, try it first on an animal; if it agree with the\r\nstomach of the animal, he makes further experiments, and this was the\r\nway John took. His brain was teeming with projects to overturn the\r\nliberties of America, and the representative system of government, and\r\nhe began by hinting it in little companies. The secretary of John Jay,\r\nan excellent painter and a poor politician, told me, in presence of\r\nanother American, Daniel Parker, that in a company where himself was\r\npresent, John Adams talked of making the government hereditary, and that\r\nas Mr. Washington had no children, it should be made hereditary in the\r\nfamily of Lund Washington.(1) John had not impudence enough to propose\r\nhimself in the first instance, as the old French Normandy baron did,\r\nwho offered to come over to be king of America, and if Congress did not\r\naccept his offer, that they would give him thirty thousand pounds for\r\nthe generosity of it(2); but John, like a mole, was grubbing his way to\r\nit under ground. He knew that Lund Washington was unknown, for nobody\r\nhad heard of him, and that as the president had no children to succeed\r\nhim, the vice-president had, and if the treason had succeeded, and the\r\nhint with it, the goldsmith might be sent for to take measure of the\r\nhead of John or of his son for a golden wig. In this case, the good\r\npeople of Boston might have for a king the man they have rejected as a\r\ndelegate. The representative system is fatal to ambition.\r\n\r\n     1 See supra footnote on p. 288.--_Editor._\r\n\r\n     2 See vol. ii. p. 318 of this work.--_Editor._\r\n\r\nKnowing, as I do, the consummate vanity of John Adams, and the\r\nshallowness of his judgment, I can easily picture to myself that when\r\nhe arrived at the Federal City he was strutting in the pomp of his\r\nimagination before the presidential house, or in the audience hall, and\r\nexulting in the language of Nebuchadnezzar, \"Is not this great Babylon,\r\nthat I have built for the honour of my Majesty!\" But in that unfortunate\r\nhour, or soon after, John, like Nebuchadnezzar, was driven from among\r\nmen, and fled with the speed of a post-horse.\r\n\r\nSome of John Adams's loyal subjects, I see, have been to present him\r\nwith an address on his birthday; but the language they use is too tame\r\nfor the occasion. Birthday addresses, like birthday odes, should not\r\ncreep along like mildrops down a cabbage leaf, but roll in a torrent of\r\npoetical metaphor. I will give them a specimen for the next year. Here\r\nit is--\r\n\r\nWhen an Ant, in travelling over the globe, lift up its foot, and put it\r\nagain on the ground, it shakes the earth to its centre: but when YOU,\r\nthe mighty Ant of the East, was born, &c. &c. &c, the centre jumped upon\r\nthe surface.\r\n\r\nThis, gentlemen, is the proper style of addresses from _well-bred_ ants\r\nto the monarch of the ant hills; and as I never take pay for preaching,\r\npraying, politics, or poetry, I make you a present of it. Some people\r\ntalk of impeaching John Adams; but I am for softer measures. I would\r\nkeep him to make fun of. He will then answer one of the ends for which\r\nhe was born, and he ought to be thankful that I am arrived to take his\r\npart. I voted in earnest to save the life of one unfortunate king, and\r\nI now vote in jest to save another. It is my fate to be always plagued\r\nwith fools. But to return to Federalism and apostacy.\r\n\r\nThe plan of the leaders of the faction was to overthrow the liberties\r\nof the new world, and place government on the corrupt system of the old.\r\nThey wanted to hold their power by a more lasting tenure than the choice\r\nof their constituents. It is impossible to account for their conduct and\r\nthe measures they adopted on any other ground. But to accomplish that\r\nobject, a standing army and a prodigal revenue must be raised; and to\r\nobtain these, pretences must be invented to deceive. Alarms of dangers\r\nthat did not exist even in imagination, but in the direct spirit of\r\nlying, were spread abroad. Apostacy stalked through the land in the garb\r\nof patriotism, and the torch of treason blinded for a while the flame of\r\nliberty.\r\n\r\nFor what purpose could an army of twenty-five thousand men be wanted?\r\nA single reflection might have taught the most credulous that while\r\nthe war raged between France and England, neither could spare a man to\r\ninvade America. For what purpose, then, could it be wanted? The case\r\ncarries its own explanation. It was wanted for the purpose of destroying\r\nthe representative system, for it could be employed for no other. Are\r\nthese men Federalists? If they are, they are federalized to deceive and\r\nto destroy.\r\n\r\nThe rage against Dr. Logan's patriotic and voluntary mission to France\r\nwas excited by the shame they felt at the detection of the false alarms\r\nthey had circulated. As to the opposition given by the remnant of\r\nthe faction to the repeal of the taxes laid on during the former\r\nadministration, it is easily accounted for. The repeal of those taxes\r\nwas a sentence of condemnation on those who laid them on, and in the\r\nopposition they gave in that repeal, they are to be considered in the\r\nlight of criminals standing on their defence, and the country has passed\r\njudgment upon them.\r\n\r\nThomas Paine.\r\n\r\nCity of Washington, Lovett's Hotel, Nov. 19, 1802.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER III.(1)\r\n\r\n\r\n     1 The National Intelligencer, Dec. 29th, 1802.--_Editor._.\r\n\r\nTo ELECT, and to REJECT, is the prerogative of a free people.\r\n\r\nSince the establishment of Independence, no period has arrived that\r\nso decidedly proves the excellence of the representative system of\r\ngovernment, and its superiority over every other, as the time we now\r\nlive in. Had America been cursed with John Adams's _hereditary Monarchy_\r\nor Alexander Hamilton's _Senate for life_ she must have sought, in the\r\ndoubtful contest of civil war, what she now obtains by the expression of\r\npublic will. An appeal to elections decides better than an appeal to the\r\nsword.\r\n\r\nThe Reign of Terror that raged in America during the latter end of the\r\nWashington administration, and the whole of that of Adams, is enveloped\r\nin mystery to me. That there were men in the government hostile to the\r\nrepresentative system, was once their boast, though it is now their\r\noverthrow, and therefore the fact is established against them. But that\r\nso large a mass of the people should become the dupes of those who were\r\nloading them with taxes in order to load them with chains, and deprive\r\nthem of the right of election, can be ascribed only to that species\r\nof wildfire rage, lighted up by falsehood, that not only acts without\r\nreflection, but is too impetuous to make any.\r\n\r\nThere is a general and striking difference between the genuine effects\r\nof truth itself, and the effects of falsehood believed to be truth.\r\nTruth is naturally benign; but falsehood believed to be truth is always\r\nfurious. The former delights in serenity, is mild and persuasive, and\r\nseeks not the auxiliary aid of invention. The latter sticks at nothing.\r\nIt has naturally no morals. Every lie is welcome that suits its purpose.\r\nIt is the innate character of the thing to act in this manner, and the\r\ncriterion by which it may be known, whether in politics or religion.\r\nWhen any thing is attempted to be supported by lying, it is presumptive\r\nevidence that the thing so supported is a lie also. The stock on which a\r\nlie can be grafted must be of the same species as the graft.\r\n\r\nWhat is become of the mighty clamour of French invasion, and the cry\r\nthat our country is in danger, and taxes and armies must be raised to\r\ndefend it? The danger is fled with the faction that created it, and what\r\nis worst of all, the money is fled too. It is I only that have committed\r\nthe hostility of invasion, and all the artillery of popguns are prepared\r\nfor action. Poor fellows, how they foam! They set half their own\r\npartisans in laughter; for among ridiculous things nothing is more\r\nridiculous than ridiculous rage. But I hope they will not leave off. I\r\nshall lose half my greatness when they cease to lie.\r\n\r\nSo far as respects myself, I have reason to believe, and a right to say,\r\nthat the leaders of the Reign of Terror in America and the leaders of\r\nthe Reign of Terror in France, during the time of Robespierre, were in\r\ncharacter the same sort of men; or how is it to be accounted for, that\r\nI was persecuted by both at the same time? When I was voted out of\r\nthe French Convention, the reason assigned for it was, that I was a\r\nforeigner. When Robespierre had me seized in the night, and imprisoned\r\nin the Luxembourg, (where I remained eleven months,) he assigned no\r\nreason for it. But when he proposed bringing me to the tribunal, which\r\nwas like sending me at once to the scaffold, he then assigned a reason,\r\nand the reason was, _for the interests of America as well as of France,\r\n\"Pour les intérêts de l'Amérique autant que de la France_\" The words are\r\nin his own hand-writing, and reported to the Convention by the committee\r\nappointed to examine his papers, and are printed in their report, with\r\nthis reflection added to them, \"_Why Thomas Paine more than another?\r\nBecause he contributed to the liberty of both worlds_.\"(1)\r\n\r\n     1 See my \"Life of Paine,\" vol. ii., pp. 79, 81. Also, the\r\n     historical introduction to XXI., p. 330, of this volume.\r\n     Robespierre never wrote an idle word. This Paine well knew,\r\n     as Mirabeau, who said of Robespierre: \"That man will go far\r\n     he believes every word he says.\"--_Editor._\r\n\r\nThere must have been a coalition in sentiment, if not in fact, between\r\nthe Terrorists of America and the Terrorists of France, and Robespierre\r\nmust have known it, or he could not have had the idea of putting America\r\ninto the bill of accusation against me. Yet these men, these Terrorists\r\nof the new world, who were waiting in the devotion of their hearts for\r\nthe joyful news of my destruction, are the same banditti who are now\r\nbellowing in all the hacknied language of hacknied hypocrisy, about\r\nhumanity, and piety, and often about something they call infidelity, and\r\nthey finish with the chorus of _Crucify him, crucify him_. I am become\r\nso famous among them, they cannot eat or drink without me. I serve them\r\nas a standing dish, and they cannot make up a bill of fare if I am not\r\nin it.\r\n\r\nBut there is one dish, and that the choicest of all, that they have not\r\npresented on the table, and it is time they should. They have not yet\r\n_accused Providence of Infidelity_. Yet according to their outrageous\r\npiety, she(1) must be as bad as Thomas Paine; she has protected him in\r\nall his dangers, patronized him in all his undertakings, encouraged him\r\nin all his ways, and rewarded him at last by bringing him in safety and\r\nin health to the Promised Land. This is more than she did by the Jews,\r\nthe chosen people, that they tell us she brought out of the land\r\nof Egypt, and out of the house of bondage; for they all died in the\r\nwilderness, and Moses too.\r\n\r\nI was one of the nine members that composed the first Committee of\r\nConstitution. Six of them have been destroyed. Sièyes and myself have\r\nsurvived--he by bending with the times, and I by not bending. The other\r\nsurvivor joined Robespierre, he was seized and imprisoned in his turn,\r\nand sentenced to transportation. He has since apologized to me for\r\nhaving signed the warrant, by saying he felt himself in danger and was\r\nobliged to do it.(2)\r\n\r\n     1 Is this a \"survival\" of the goddess Fortuna?--_Editor._\r\n\r\n     2 Barère.    His apology to Paine proves that a death-\r\n     warrant had been issued, for Barère did not sign the order\r\n     for Paine's arrest or imprisonment.--_Editor._\r\n\r\nHérault Sechelles, an acquaintance of Mr. Jefferson, and a good patriot,\r\nwas my _suppléant_ as member of the Committee of Constitution, that is,\r\nhe was to supply my place, if I had not accepted or had resigned, being\r\nnext in number of votes to me. He was imprisoned in the Luxembourg with\r\nme, was taken to the tribunal and the guillotine, and I, his principal,\r\nwas left.\r\n\r\nThere were two foreigners in the Convention, Anarcharsis Clootz and\r\nmyself. We were both put out of the Convention by the same vote,\r\narrested by the same order, and carried to prison together the same\r\nnight. He was taken to the guillotine, and I was again left. Joel Barlow\r\nwas with us when we went to prison.\r\n\r\nJoseph Lebon, one of the vilest characters that ever existed, and who\r\nmade the streets of Arras run with blood, was my _suppléant_, as member\r\nof the Convention for the department of the Pas de Calais. When I\r\nwas put out of the Convention he came and took my place. When I was\r\nliberated from prison and voted again into the Convention, he was sent\r\nto the same prison and took my place there, and he was sent to the\r\nguillotine instead of me. He supplied my place all the way through.\r\n\r\nOne hundred and sixty-eight persons were taken out of the Luxembourg\r\nin one night, and a hundred and sixty of them guillotined next day, of\r\nwhich I now know I was to have been one; and the manner I escaped that\r\nfate is curious, and has all the appearance of accident.\r\n\r\nThe room in which I was lodged was on the ground floor, and one of a\r\nlong range of rooms under a gallery, and the door of it opened outward\r\nand flat against the wall; so that when it was open the inside of the\r\ndoor appeared outward, and the contrary when it was shut. I had three\r\ncomrades, fellow prisoners with me, Joseph Vanhuele, of Bruges, since\r\nPresident of the Municipality of that town, Michael Rubyns, and Charles\r\nBastini of Louvain.\r\n\r\nWhen persons by scores and by hundreds were to be taken out of the\r\nprison for the guillotine it was always done in the night, and those who\r\nperformed that office had a private mark or signal, by which they knew\r\nwhat rooms to go to, and what number to take. We, as I have stated, were\r\nfour, and the door of our room was marked, unobserved by us, with that\r\nnumber in chalk; but it happened, if happening is a proper word, that\r\nthe mark was put on when the door was open, and flat against the\r\nwall, and thereby came on the inside when we shut it at night, and the\r\ndestroying angel passed by it.(1) A few days after this, Robespierre\r\nfell, and Mr. Monroe arrived and reclaimed me, and invited me to his\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\n     1 Painefs preface to the \"Age of Reason\" Part IL, and his\r\n     Letter to Washington (p. 222.) show that for some time after\r\n     his release from prison he had attributed his escape from\r\n     the guillotine to a fever which rendered him unconscious at\r\n     the time when his accusation was demanded by Robespierre;\r\n     but it will be seen (XXXI.) that he subsequently visited his\r\n     prison room-mate Vanhuele, who had become Mayor of Bruges,\r\n     and he may have learned from him the particulars of their\r\n     marvellous escape. Carlyle having been criticised by John G.\r\n     Alger for crediting this story of the chalk mark, an\r\n     exhaustive discussion of the facts took place in the London\r\n     Athenoum, July 7, 21, August 25, September 1, 1894, in which\r\n     it was conclusively proved, I think, that there is no reason\r\n     to doubt the truth of the incident See also my article on\r\n     Paine's escape, in The Open Court (Chicago), July 26,1894.\r\n     The discussion in the Athenoum elicited the fact that a\r\n     tradition had long existed in the family of Sampson Perry\r\n     that he had shared Paine's cell and been saved by the\r\n     curious mistake. Such is not the fact. Perry, in his book on\r\n     the French Revolution, and in his \"Argus,\" told the story of\r\n     Paine's escape by his illness, as Paine first told it; and\r\n     he also relates an anecdote which may find place here:\r\n     \"Mr. Paine speaks gratefully of the kindness shown him by his\r\n     fellow-prisoners of the same chamber during his severe\r\n     malady, and especially of the skilful and voluntary\r\n     assistance lent him by General O'Hara's surgeon. He relates\r\n     an anecdote of himself which may not be unworthy of\r\n     repeating. An arrêt of the Committee of Public Welfare had\r\n     given directions to the administrators of the palace\r\n     [Luxembourg] to enter all the prisons with additional guards\r\n     and dispossess every prisoner of his knives, forks, and\r\n     every other sharp instrument; and also to take their money\r\n     from them. This happened a short time before Mr. Paine's\r\n     illness, and as this ceremony was represented to him as an\r\n     atrocious plunder in the dregs of municipality, he\r\n     determined to avert its effect so far as it concerned\r\n     himself. He had an English bank note of some value and gold\r\n     coin in his pocket, and as he conceived the visitors would\r\n     rifle them, as well as his trunks (though they did not do so\r\n     by any one) he took off the lock from his door, and hid the\r\n     whole of what he had about him in its inside. He recovered\r\n     his health, he found his money, but missed about three\r\n     hundred of his associated prisoners, who had been sent in\r\n     crowds to the murderous tribunal, while he had been\r\n     insensible of their or his own danger.\" This was probably\r\n     the money (£200) loaned by Paine to General O'Hara (who\r\n     figured at the Yorktown surrender) in prison.--_Editor._\r\n\r\nDuring the whole of my imprisonment, prior to the fall of Robespierre,\r\nthere was no time when I could think my life worth twenty-four hours,\r\nand my mind was made up to meet its fate. The Americans in Paris went in\r\na body to the Convention to reclaim me, but without success. There was\r\nno party among them with respect to me. My only hope then rested on the\r\ngovernment of America, that it would _remember me_. But the icy heart of\r\ningratitude, in whatever man it be placed, has neither feeling nor\r\nsense of honour. The letter of Mr. Jefferson has served to wipe away the\r\nreproach, and done justice to the mass of the people of America.(1)\r\n\r\n     1 Printed in the seventh of this series of Letters.--\r\n     _Editor._.\r\n\r\nWhen a party was forming, in the latter end of 1777, and beginning of\r\n1778, of which John Adams was one, to remove Mr. Washington from the\r\ncommand of the army on the complaint that _he did nothing_, I wrote the\r\nfifth number of the Crisis, and published it at Lancaster, (Congress\r\nthen being at Yorktown, in Pennsylvania,) to ward off that meditated\r\nblow; for though I well knew that the black times of '76 were the\r\nnatural consequence of his want of military judgment in the choice of\r\npositions into which the army was put about New York and New Jersey, I\r\ncould see no possible advantage, and nothing but mischief, that could\r\narise by distracting the army into parties, which would have been the\r\ncase had the intended motion gone on.\r\n\r\nGeneral [Charles] Lee, who with a sarcastic genius joined a great fund\r\nof military knowledge, was perfectly right when he said \"_We have no\r\nbusiness on islands, and in the bottom of bogs, where the enemy, by the\r\naid of its ships, can bring its whole force against apart of ours and\r\nshut it up_.\" This had like to have been the case at New York, and it\r\nwas the case at Fort Washington, and would have been the case at Fort\r\nLee if General [Nathaniel] Greene had not moved instantly off on the\r\nfirst news of the enemy's approach. I was with Greene through the whole\r\nof that affair, and know it perfectly.\r\n\r\nBut though I came forward in defence of Mr. Washington when he was\r\nattacked, and made the best that could be made of a series of blunders\r\nthat had nearly ruined the country, he left me to perish when I was in\r\nprison. But as I told him of it in his life-time, I should not now bring\r\nit up if the ignorant impertinence of some of the Federal papers, who\r\nare pushing Mr. Washington forward as their stalking horse, did not make\r\nit necessary.\r\n\r\nThat gentleman did not perform his part in the Revolution better, nor\r\nwith more honour, than I did mine, and the one part was as necessary\r\nas the other. He accepted as a present, (though he was already rich,)\r\na hundred thousand acres of land in America, and left me to occupy six\r\nfoot of earth in France.(1) I wish, for his own reputation, he had acted\r\nwith more justice. But it was always known of Mr. Washington, by\r\nthose who best knew him, that he was of such an icy and death-like\r\nconstitution, that he neither loved his friends nor hated his enemies.\r\nBut, be this as it may, I see no reason that a difference between Mr.\r\nWashington and me should be made a theme of discord with other people.\r\nThere are those who may see merit in both, without making themselves\r\npartisans of either, and with this reflection I close the subject.\r\n\r\n     1 Paine was mistaken, as many others were, about the gifts\r\n     of Virginia (1785) to Washington. They were 100 shares, of\r\n     $100 each, in the James River Company, and 50 shares, of\r\n     £100 each, in the Potomac Company. Washington, accepted on\r\n     condition that he might appropriate them _to public uses_\r\n     which was done in his Will.--_Editor._\r\n\r\nAs to the hypocritical abuse thrown out by the Federalists on other\r\nsubjects, I recommend to them the observance of a commandment that\r\nexisted before either Christian or Jew existed:\r\n\r\n     Thou shalt make a covenant with thy senses:\r\n     With thine eye  that it behold no evil,\r\n     With thine ear, that it hear no evil,\r\n     With thy tongue, that it speak no evil,\r\n     With thy hands, that they commit no evil.\r\n\r\nIf the Federalists will follow this commandment, they will leave off\r\nlying.\r\n\r\nThomas Paine.\r\n\r\nFederal City, Lovett's Hotel, Nov. 26,1802.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER IV.(1)\r\n\r\n     1 The National Intelligencer, Dec. 6th. 1802.--_Editor._.\r\n\r\nAs Congress is on the point of meeting, the public papers will\r\nnecessarily be occupied with the debates of the ensuing session, and\r\nas, in consequence of my long absence from America, my private affairs\r\nrequire my attendance, (for it is necessary I do this, or I could not\r\npreserve, as I do, my independence,) I shall close my address to the\r\npublic with this letter.\r\n\r\nI congratulate them on the success of the late elections, and _that_\r\nwith the additional confidence, that while honest men are chosen and\r\nwise measures pursued, neither the treason of apostacy, masked under the\r\nname of Federalism, of which I have spoken in my second letter, nor the\r\nintrigues of foreign emissaries, acting in concert with that mask, can\r\nprevail.\r\n\r\nAs to the licentiousness of the papers calling themselves _Federal_, a\r\nname that apostacy has taken, it can hurt nobody but the party or the\r\npersons who support such papers. There is naturally a wholesome pride\r\nin the public mind that revolts at open vulgarity. It feels itself\r\ndishonoured even by hearing it, as a chaste woman feels dishonour by\r\nhearing obscenity she cannot avoid. It can smile at wit, or be diverted\r\nwith strokes of satirical humour, but it detests the _blackguard_. The\r\nsame sense of propriety that governs in private companies, governs in\r\npublic life. If a man in company runs his wit upon another, it may draw\r\na smile from some persons present, but as soon as he turns a blackguard\r\nin his language the company gives him up; and it is the same in public\r\nlife. The event of the late election shows this to be true; for in\r\nproportion as those papers have become more and more vulgar and abusive,\r\nthe elections have gone more and more against the party they support,\r\nor that supports them. Their predecessor, _Porcupine_ [Cobbett] had\r\nwit--these scribblers have none. But as soon as his _blackguardism_ (for\r\nit is the proper name of it) outran his wit, he was abandoned by every\r\nbody but the English Minister who protected him.\r\n\r\nThe Spanish proverb says, \"_there never was a cover large enough to hide\r\nitself_\"; and the proverb applies to the case of those papers and the\r\nshattered remnant of the faction that supports them. The falsehoods they\r\nfabricate, and the abuse they circulate, is a cover to hide something\r\nfrom being seen, but it is not large enough to hide itself. It is as\r\na tub thrown out to the whale to prevent its attacking and sinking the\r\nvessel. They want to draw the attention of the public from thinking\r\nabout, or inquiring into, the measures of the late administration, and\r\nthe reason why so much public money was raised and expended; and so far\r\nas a lie today, and a new one tomorrow, will answer this purpose, it\r\nanswers theirs. It is nothing to them whether they be believed or not,\r\nfor if the negative purpose be answered the main point is answered, to\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nHe that picks your pocket always tries to make you look another way.\r\n\"Look,\" says he, \"at yon man t'other side the street--what a nose he has\r\ngot?--Lord, yonder is a chimney on fire!--Do you see yon man going along\r\nin the salamander great coat? That is the very man that stole one of\r\nJupiter's satellites, and sold it to a countryman for a gold watch,\r\nand it set his breeches on fire!\" Now the man that has his hand in your\r\npocket, does not care a farthing whether you believe what he says or\r\nnot. All his aim is to prevent your looking at _him_; and this is the\r\ncase with the remnant of the Federal faction. The leaders of it have\r\nimposed upon the country, and they want to turn the attention of it from\r\nthe subject.\r\n\r\nIn taking up any public matter, I have never made it a consideration,\r\nand never will, whether it be popular or unpopular; but whether it be\r\n_right_ or _wrong_. The right will always become the popular, if it has\r\ncourage to show itself, and the shortest way is always a straight line.\r\nI despise expedients, they are the gutter-hole of politics, and the sink\r\nwhere reputation dies. In the present case, as in every other, I\r\ncannot be accused of using any; and I have no doubt but thousands will\r\nhereafter be ready to say, as Gouverneur Morris said to me, after having\r\nabused me pretty handsomely in Congress for the opposition I gave\r\nthe fraudulent demand of Silas Deane of two thousand pounds sterling:\r\n\"_Well, we were all duped, and I among the rest!_\"(1)\r\n\r\n     1 See vol. I., chapters xxii., xxiii., xxiv., of this work.\r\n     Also my \"Life of Paine,\" vol. I., ch. ix., x.--_Editor._\r\n\r\nWere the late administration to be called upon to give reasons for\r\nthe expence it put the country to, it can give none. The danger of an\r\ninvasion was a bubble that served as a cover to raise taxes and armies\r\nto be employed on some other purpose. But if the people of America\r\nbelieved it true, the cheerfulness with which they supported those\r\nmeasures and paid those taxes is an evidence of their patriotism; and\r\nif they supposed me their enemy, though in that supposition they did me\r\ninjustice, it was not injustice in them. He that acts as he believes,\r\nthough he may act wrong, is not conscious of wrong.\r\n\r\nBut though there was no danger, no thanks are due to the late\r\nadministration for it. They sought to blow up a flame between the two\r\ncountries; and so intent were they upon this, that they went out of\r\ntheir way to accomplish it. In a letter which the Secretary of State,\r\nTimothy Pickering, wrote to Mr. Skipwith, the American Consul at Paris,\r\nhe broke off from the official subject of his letter, to _thank God_ in\r\nvery exulting language, _that the Russians had cut the French army\r\nto pieces_. Mr. Skipwith, after showing me the letter, very prudently\r\nconcealed it.\r\n\r\nIt was the injudicious and wicked acrimony of this letter, and some\r\nother like conduct of the then Secretary of State, that occasioned me,\r\nin a letter to a friend in the government, to say, that if there was any\r\nofficial business to be done in France, till a regular Minister could\r\nbe appointed, it could not be trusted to a more proper person than Mr.\r\nSkipwith. \"_He is_,\" said I, \"_an honest man, and will do business, and\r\nthat with good manners to the government he is commissioned to act with.\r\nA faculty which that BEAR, Timothy Pickering, wanted, and which the BEAR\r\nof that bear, John Adams, never possessed_.\"(2)\r\n\r\n     2 By reference to the letter itself (p. 376 of this volume)\r\n     it will be seen that Paine here quotes it from memory.--\r\n     _Editor._ vol III--\r\n\r\nIn another letter to the same friend, in 1797, and which was put\r\nunsealed under cover to Colonel Burr, I expressed a satisfaction\r\nthat Mr. Jefferson, since he was not president, had accepted the\r\nvice presidency; \"_for_,\" said I, \"_John Adams has such a talent for\r\nblundering and offending, it will be necessary to keep an eye over\r\nhim_.\" He has now sufficiently proved, that though I have not the spirit\r\nof prophecy, I have the gift of _judging right_. And all the world\r\nknows, for it cannot help knowing, that to judge _rightly_ and to write\r\n_clearly_, and that upon all sorts of subjects, to be able to command\r\nthought and as it were to play with it at pleasure, and be always master\r\nof one's temper in writing, is the faculty only of a serene mind, and\r\nthe attribute of a happy and philosophical temperament. The scribblers,\r\nwho know me not, and who fill their papers with paragraphs about me,\r\nbesides their want of talents, drink too many slings and drams in a\r\nmorning to have any chance with me. But, poor fellows, they must do\r\nsomething for the little pittance they get from their employers. This is\r\nmy apology for them.\r\n\r\nMy anxiety to get back to America was great for many years. It is the\r\ncountry of my heart, and the place of my political and literary birth.\r\nIt was the American revolution that made me an author, and forced into\r\naction the mind that had been dormant, and had no wish for public life,\r\nnor has it now. By the accounts I received, she appeared to me to be\r\ngoing wrong, and that some meditated treason against her liberties\r\nlurked at the bottom of her government. I heard that my friends were\r\noppressed, and I longed to take my stand among them, and if other times\r\nto _try mens souls_ were to arrive, that I might bear my share. But my\r\nefforts to return were ineffectual.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Mr. Monroe had made a good standing with the French\r\ngovernment, for the conduct of his predecessor [Morris] had made his\r\nreception as Minister difficult, he wanted to send despatches to his own\r\ngovernment by a person to whom he could confide a verbal communication,\r\nand he fixed his choice on me. He then applied to the Committee of\r\nPublic Safety for a passport; but as I had been voted again into the\r\nConvention, it was only the Convention that could give the passport;\r\nand as an application to them for that purpose, would have made my going\r\npublicly known, I was obliged to sustain the disappointment, and Mr.\r\nMonroe to lose the opportunity.(1)\r\n\r\nWhen that gentleman left France to return to America, I was to have\r\ngone with him. It was fortunate I did not. The vessel he sailed in was\r\nvisited by a British frigate, that searched every part of it, and down\r\nto the hold, for Thomas Paine.(2) I then went, the same year, to embark\r\nat Havre. But several British frigates were cruizing in sight of the\r\nport who knew I was there, and I had to return again to Paris. Seeing\r\nmyself thus cut off from every opportunity that was in my power to\r\ncommand, I wrote to Mr. Jefferson, that, if the fate of the election\r\nshould put him in the chair of the presidency, and he should have\r\noccasion to send a frigate to France, he would give me the opportunity\r\nof returning by it, which he did. But I declined coming by the\r\n_Maryland_, the vessel that was offered me, and waited for the frigate\r\nthat was to bring the new Minister, Mr. Chancellor Livingston, to\r\nFrance. But that frigate was ordered round to the Mediterranean; and\r\nas at that time the war was over, and the British cruisers called in,\r\nI could come any way. I then agreed to come with Commodore Barney in a\r\nvessel he had engaged. It was again fortunate I did not, for the vessel\r\nsank at sea, and the people were preserved in the boat.\r\n\r\n     1 The correspondence is in my \"Life of Paine,\" vol. ii.,\r\n     pp. 154-5.--_Editor._\r\n\r\n     2 The \"Dublin Packet,\" Captain Clay, in whom Paine, as he\r\n     wrote to Jefferson, \"had  no confidence.\"--_Editor._\r\n\r\nHad half the number of evils befallen me that the number of dangers\r\namount to through which I have been pre-served, there are those who\r\nwould ascribe it to the wrath of heaven; why then do they not ascribe\r\nmy preservation to the protecting favour of heaven? Even in my worldly\r\nconcerns I have been blessed. The little property I left in America,\r\nand which I cared nothing about, not even to receive the rent of it,\r\nhas been increasing in the value of its capital more than eight hundred\r\ndollars every year, for the fourteen years and more that I have been\r\nabsent from it. I am now in my circumstances independent; and my economy\r\nmakes me rich. As to my health, it is perfectly good, and I leave the\r\nworld to judge of the stature of my mind. I am in every instance a\r\nliving contradiction to the mortified Federalists.\r\n\r\nIn my publications, I follow the rule I began with in _Common Sense_,\r\nthat is, to consult nobody, nor to let any body see what I write till\r\nit appears publicly. Were I to do otherwise, the case would be, that\r\nbetween the timidity of some, who are so afraid of doing wrong that they\r\nnever do right, the puny judgment of others, and the despicable craft of\r\npreferring _expedient to right_, as if the world was a world of babies\r\nin leading strings, I should get forward with nothing. My path is a\r\nright line, as straight and clear to me as a ray of light. The boldness\r\n(if they will have it to be so) with which I speak on any subject, is a\r\ncompliment to the judgment of the reader. It is like saying to him,\r\n_I treat you as a man and not as a child_. With respect to any worldly\r\nobject, as it is impossible to discover any in me, therefore what I do,\r\nand my manner of doing it, ought to be ascribed to a good motive.\r\n\r\nIn a great affair, where the happiness of man is at stake, I love\r\nto work for nothing; and so fully am I under the influence of this\r\nprinciple, that I should lose the spirit, the pleasure, and the pride\r\nof it, were I conscious that I looked for reward; and with this\r\ndeclaration, I take my leave for the present.(1)\r\n\r\n     1 The self-assertion of this and other letters about this\r\n     time was really self-defence, the invective against him, and\r\n     the calumnies, being such as can hardly be credited by those\r\n     not familiar with the publications of that time.--_Editor._\r\n\r\nThomas Paine.\r\n\r\nFederal City, Lovett's Hotel, Dec. 3, 1802.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER V.(1)\r\n\r\n     1 The National Intelligencer, Feb., 1803. In the Tarions\r\n     collections of these Letters there appears at this point a\r\n     correspondence between Paine and Samuel Adams of Boston, but\r\n     as it relates to religious matters I reserve it for the\r\n     fourth volume.--_Editor._.\r\n\r\nIt is always the interest of a far greater part of the nation to have\r\na thing right than to have it wrong; and therefore, in a country whose\r\ngovernment is founded on the system of election and representation, the\r\nfate of every party is decided by its principles.\r\n\r\nAs this system is the only form and principle of government by which\r\nliberty can be preserved, and the only one that can embrace all the\r\nvarieties of a great extent of country, it necessarily follows, that to\r\nhave the representation real, the election must be real; and that where\r\nthe election is a fiction, the representation is a fiction also. _Like\r\nwill always produce like_.\r\n\r\nA great deal has been said and written concerning the conduct of Mr.\r\nBurr, during the late contest, in the federal legislature, whether Mr.\r\nJefferson or Mr. Burr should be declared President of the United States.\r\nMr. Burr has been accused of intriguing to obtain the Presidency.\r\nWhether this charge be substantiated or not makes little or no part of\r\nthe purport of this letter. There is a point of much higher importance\r\nto attend to than any thing that relates to the individual Mr. Burr: for\r\nthe great point is not whether Mr. Burr has intrigued, but whether the\r\nlegislature has intrigued with _him_.\r\n\r\nMr. Ogden, a relation of one of the senators of New Jersey of the same\r\nname, and of the party assuming the style of Federalists, has written\r\na letter published in the New York papers, signed with his name, the\r\npurport of which is to exculpate Mr. Burr from the charges brought\r\nagainst him. In this letter he says:\r\n\r\n\"When about to return from Washington, two or three _members of\r\nCongress_ of the federal party spoke to me of _their views_, as to the\r\nelection of a president, desiring me to converse with Colonel Burr on\r\nthe subject, and to ascertain _whether he would enter into terms_. On my\r\nreturn to New York I called on Colonel Burr, and communicated the above\r\nto him. He explicitly declined the explanation, and _did neither propose\r\nnor agree to any terms_.\"\r\n\r\nHow nearly is human cunning allied to folly! The animals to whom nature\r\nhas given the faculty we call _cunning_, know always when to use it,\r\nand use it wisely; but when man descends to cunning, he blunders and\r\nbetrays.\r\n\r\nMr. Ogden's letter is intended to exculpate Mr. Burr from the charge\r\nof intriguing to obtain the presidency; and the letter that he (Ogden)\r\nwrites for this purpose is direct evidence against his party in\r\nCongress, that they intrigued with Burr to obtain him for President,\r\nand employed him (Ogden) for the purpose. To save _Aaron_, he betrays\r\n_Moses_, and then turns informer against the _Golden Calf_.\r\n\r\nIt is but of little importance to the world to know if Mr. Burr\r\n_listened_ to an intriguing proposal, but it is of great importance to\r\nthe constituents to know if their representatives in Congress made one.\r\nThe ear can commit no crime, but the tongue may; and therefore the right\r\npolicy is to drop Mr. Burr, as being only the hearer, and direct the\r\nwhole charge against the Federal faction in Congress as the active\r\noriginal culprit, or, if the priests will have scripture for it, as the\r\nserpent that beguiled Eve.\r\n\r\n     1 In the presidential canvas of 1800, the votes in the\r\n     electoral college being equally divided between Burr and\r\n     Jefferson, the election was thrown into the House of\r\n     Representatives. Jefferson was elected on the 36th ballot,\r\n     but he never forgave Burr, and between these two old friends\r\n     Paine had to write this letter under some embarrassment. The\r\n     last paragraph of this Letter shows Paine's desire for a\r\n     reconciliation between Burr and Jefferson. Aaron Burr is one\r\n     of the traditionally slandered figures of American history.\r\n     --_Editor._\r\n\r\nThe plot of the intrigue was to make Mr. Burr President, on the private\r\ncondition of his agreeing to, and entering into, terms with them, that\r\nis, with the proposers. Had then the election been made, the country,\r\nknowing nothing of this private and illegal transaction, would have\r\nsupposed, for who could have supposed otherwise, that it had a President\r\naccording to the forms, principles, and intention of the constitution.\r\nNo such thing. Every form, principle, and intention of the constitution\r\nwould have been violated; and instead of a President, it would have had\r\na mute, a sort of image, hand-bound and tongue-tied, the dupe and slave\r\nof a party, placed on the theatre of the United States, and acting the\r\nfarce of President.\r\n\r\nIt is of little importance, in a constitutional sense, to know what the\r\nterms to be proposed might be, because any terms other than those which\r\nthe constitution prescribes to a President are criminal. Neither do I\r\nsee how Mr. Burr, or any other person put in the same condition, could\r\nhave taken the oath prescribed by the constitution to a President, which\r\nis, \"_I do solemnly swear (or affirm,) that I will faithfully execute\r\nthe office of President of the United States, and will to the best of\r\nmy ability preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United\r\nStates_.\"\r\n\r\nHow, I ask, could such a person have taken such an oath, knowing at the\r\nsame time that he had entered into the Presidency on terms unknown\r\nin the Constitution, and private, and which would deprive him of the\r\nfreedom and power of acting as President of the United States, agreeably\r\nto his constitutional oath?\r\n\r\nMr. Burr, by not agreeing to terms, has escaped the danger to which\r\nthey exposed him, and the perjury that would have followed, and also\r\nthe punishment annexed thereto. Had he accepted the Presidency on\r\nterms unknown in the constitution, and private, and had the transaction\r\nafterwards transpired, (which it most probably would, for roguery is a\r\nthing difficult to conceal,) it would have produced a sensation in the\r\ncountry too violent to be quieted, and too just to be resisted; and in\r\nany case the election must have been void.\r\n\r\nBut what are we to think of those members of Congress, who having taken\r\nan oath of the same constitutional import as the oath of the President,\r\nviolate that oath by tampering to obtain a President on private\r\nconditions. If this is not sedition against the constitution and the\r\ncountry, it is difficult to define what sedition in a representative can\r\nbe.\r\n\r\nSay not that this statement of the case is the effect of personal or\r\nparty resentment. No. It is the effect of _sincere concern_ that such\r\ncorruption, of which this is but a sample, should, in the space of a few\r\nyears, have crept into a country that had the fairest opportunity that\r\nProvidence ever gave, within the knowledge of history, of making itself\r\nan illustrious example to the world.\r\n\r\nWhat the terms were, or were to be, it is probable we never shall know;\r\nor what is more probable, that feigned ones, if any, will be given. But\r\nfrom the conduct of the party since that time we may conclude, that no\r\ntaxes would have been taken off, that the clamour for war would have\r\nbeen kept up, new expences incurred, and taxes and offices increased\r\nin consequence; and, among the articles of a private nature, that\r\nthe leaders in this seditious traffic were to stipulate with the mock\r\nPresident for lucrative appointments for themselves.\r\n\r\nBut if these plotters against the Constitution understood their\r\nbusiness, and they had been plotting long enough to be masters of it, a\r\nsingle article would have comprehended every thing, which is, _That the\r\nPresident (thus made) should be governed in all cases whatsoever by a\r\nprivate junto appointed by themselves_. They could then, through the\r\nmedium of a mock President, have negatived all bills which their\r\nparty in Congress could not have opposed with success, and reduced\r\nrepresentation to a nullity.\r\n\r\nThe country has been imposed upon, and the real culprits are but few;\r\nand as it is necessary for the peace, harmony, and honour of the Union,\r\nto separate the deceiver from the deceived, the betrayer from the\r\nbetrayed, that men who once were friends, and that in the worst of\r\ntimes, should be friends again, it is necessary, as a beginning, that\r\nthis dark business be brought to full investigation. Ogden's letter\r\nis direct evidence of the fact of tampering to obtain a conditional\r\nPresident. He knows the two or three members of Congress that\r\ncommissioned him, and they know who commissioned them.\r\n\r\nThomas Paine.\r\n\r\nFederal City, Lovett's Hotel, Jan. 29th, 1803.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER VI.(1)\r\n\r\n     1 The Aurora (Philadelphia).--_Editor._.\r\n\r\nReligion and War is the cry of the Federalists; Morality and Peace the\r\nvoice of Republicans. The union of Morality and Peace is congenial;\r\nbut that of Religion and War is a paradox, and the solution of it is\r\nhypocrisy.\r\n\r\nThe leaders of the Federalists have no judgment; their plans no\r\nconsistency of parts; and want of consistency is the natural consequence\r\nof want of principle.\r\n\r\nThey exhibit to the world the curious spectacle of an _Opposition_\r\nwithout a _cause_, and conduct without system. Were they, as doctors,\r\nto prescribe medicine as they practise politics, they would poison their\r\npatients with destructive compounds.\r\n\r\nThere are not two things more opposed to each other than War and\r\nReligion; and yet, in the double game those leaders have to play, the\r\none is necessarily the theme of their politics, and the other the text\r\nof their sermons. The week-day orator of Mars, and the Sunday preacher\r\nof Federal Grace, play like gamblers into each other's hands, and this\r\nthey call Religion.\r\n\r\nThough hypocrisy can counterfeit every virtue, and become the associate\r\nof every vice, it requires a great dexterity of craft to give it the\r\npower of deceiving. A painted sun may glisten, but it cannot warm. For\r\nhypocrisy to personate virtue successfully it must know and feel what\r\nvirtue is, and as it cannot long do this, it cannot long deceive.\r\nWhen an orator foaming for War breathes forth in another sentence a\r\n_plaintive piety of words_, he may as well write hypocrisy on his front.\r\n\r\nThe late attempt of the Federal leaders in Congress (for they acted\r\nwithout the knowledge of their constituents) to plunge the country into\r\nWar, merits not only reproach but indignation. It was madness, conceived\r\nin ignorance and acted in wickedness. The head and the heart went\r\npartners in the crime.\r\n\r\nA neglect of punctuality in the performance of a treaty is made\r\na _cause_ of war by the _Barbary powers_, and of remonstrance and\r\nexplanation by _civilised powers_. The Mahometans of Barbary negociate\r\nby the sword--they seize first, and ex-postulate afterwards; and the\r\nfederal leaders have been labouring to _barbarize_ the United States by\r\nadopting the practice of the Barbary States, and this they call honour.\r\nLet their honour and their hypocrisy go weep together, for both are\r\ndefeated. Their present Administration is too moral for hypocrites, and\r\ntoo economical for public spendthrifts.\r\n\r\nA man the least acquainted with diplomatic affairs must know that a\r\nneglect in punctuality is not one of the legal causes of war, unless\r\nthat neglect be confirmed by a refusal to perform; and even then it\r\ndepends upon circumstances connected with it. The world would be in\r\ncontinual quarrels and war, and commerce be annihilated, if Algerine\r\npolicy was the law of nations. And were America, instead of becoming an\r\nexample to the old world of good and moral government and civil manners,\r\nor, if they like it better, of gentlemanly conduct towards other\r\nnations, to set up the character of ruffian, that of _word and blow, and\r\nthe blow first_, and thereby give the example of pulling down the little\r\nthat civilization has gained upon barbarism, her Independence, instead\r\nof being an honour and a blessing, would become a curse upon the world\r\nand upon herself.\r\n\r\nThe conduct of the Barbary powers, though unjust in principle, is suited\r\nto their prejudices, situation, and circumstances. The crusades of the\r\nchurch to exterminate them fixed in their minds the unobliterated belief\r\nthat every Christian power was their mortal enemy. Their religious\r\nprejudices, therefore, suggest the policy, which their situation and\r\ncircumstances protect them in. As a people, they are neither commercial\r\nnor agricultural, they neither import nor export, have no property\r\nfloating on the seas, nor ships and cargoes in the ports of foreign\r\nnations. No retaliation, therefore, can be acted upon them, and they sin\r\nsecure from punishment.\r\n\r\nBut this is not the case with the United States. If she sins as a\r\nBarbary power, she must answer for it as a Civilized one. Her commerce\r\nis continually passing on the seas exposed to capture, and her ships\r\nand cargoes in foreign ports to detention and reprisal. An act of War\r\ncommitted by her in the Mississippi would produce a War against the\r\ncommerce of the Atlantic States, and the latter would have to curse the\r\npolicy that provoked the former. In every point, therefore, in which the\r\ncharacter and interest of the United States be considered, it would\r\nill become her to set an example contrary to the policy and custom of\r\nCivilized powers, and practised only by the Barbary powers, that of\r\nstriking before she expostulates.\r\n\r\nBut can any man, calling himself a Legislator, and supposed by his\r\nconstituents to know something of his duty, be so ignorant as to imagine\r\nthat seizing on New Orleans would finish the affair or even contribute\r\ntowards it? On the contrary it would have made it worse. The treaty\r\nright of deposite at New Orleans, and the right of the navigation of the\r\nMississippi into the Gulph of Mexico, are distant things. New Orleans is\r\nmore than an hundred miles in the country from the mouth of the river,\r\nand, as a place of deposite, is of no value if the mouth of the river be\r\nshut, which either France or Spain could do, and which our possession\r\nof New Orleans could neither prevent or remove. New Orleans in our\r\npossession, by an act of hostility, would have become a blockaded\r\nport, and consequently of no value to the western people as a place of\r\ndeposite. Since, therefore, an interruption had arisen to the commerce\r\nof the western states, and until the matter could be brought to a fair\r\nexplanation, it was of less injury to have the port shut and the river\r\nopen, than to have the river shut and the port in our possession.\r\n\r\nThat New Orleans could be taken required no stretch of policy to plan,\r\nnor spirit of enterprize to effect. It was like marching behind a man to\r\nknock him down: and the dastardly slyness of such an attack would have\r\nstained the fame of the United States. Where there is no danger cowards\r\nare bold, and Captain Bobadils are to be found in the Senate as well\r\nas on the stage. Even _Gouverneur_, on such a march, dare have shown a\r\nleg.(1)\r\n\r\n     1 Gouverneur Morris being now leader of the belligerent\r\n     faction in Congress, Paine could not resist the temptation\r\n     to allude to a well-known incident (related in his Diary and\r\n     Letters, i., p. 14). A mob in Paris having surrounded his\r\n     fine carriage, crying \"Aristocrat!\" Morris showed his\r\n     wooden leg, declaring he had lost his leg in the cause of\r\n     American liberty. Morris was never in any fight, his leg\r\n     being lost by a commonplace accident while driving in\r\n     Philadelphia. Although Paine's allusion may appear in bad\r\n     taste, even with this reference, it was politeness itself\r\n     compared with the brutal abuse which Morris (not content\r\n     with imprisoning Paine in Paris) and his adherents were\r\n     heaping on the author on his return to America; also on\r\n     Monroe, whom Jefferson had returned to France to negotiate\r\n     for the purchase of Louisiana.--_Editor._,\r\n\r\nThe people of the western country to whom the Mississippi serves as\r\nan inland sea to their commerce, must be supposed to understand the\r\ncircumstances of that commerce better than a man who is a stranger to\r\nit; and as they have shown no approbation of the war-whoop measures of\r\nthe Federal senators, it becomes presumptive evidence they disapprove\r\nthem. This is a new mortification for those war-whoop politicians; for\r\nthe case is, that finding themselves losing ground and withering away in\r\nthe Atlantic States, they laid hold of the affair of New Orleans in the\r\nvain hope of rooting and reinforcing themselves in the western States;\r\nand they did this without perceiving that it was one of those ill judged\r\nhypocritical expedients in politics, that whether it succeeded or failed\r\nthe event would be the same. Had their motion [that of Ross and Morris]\r\nsucceeded, it would have endangered the commerce of the Atlantic States\r\nand ruined their reputation there; and on the other hand the attempt\r\nto make a tool of the western people was so badly concealed as to\r\nextinguish all credit with them.\r\n\r\nBut hypocrisy is a vice of sanguine constitution. It flatters and\r\npromises itself every thing; and it has yet to learn, with respect to\r\nmoral and political reputation, it is less dangerous to offend than to\r\ndeceive.\r\n\r\nTo the measures of administration, supported by the firmness and\r\nintegrity of the majority in Congress, the United States owe, as far as\r\nhuman means are concerned, the preservation of peace, and of national\r\nhonour. The confidence which the western people reposed in the\r\ngovernment and their representatives is rewarded with success. They are\r\nreinstated in their rights with the least possible loss of time; and\r\ntheir harmony with the people of New Orleans, so necessary to the\r\nprosperity of the United States, which would have been broken, and the\r\nseeds of discord sown in its place, had hostilities been preferred to\r\naccommodation, remains unimpaired. Have the Federal ministers of the\r\nchurch meditated on these matters? and laying aside, as they ought to\r\ndo, their electioneering and vindictive prayers and sermons, returned\r\nthanks that peace is preserved, and commerce, without the stain of\r\nblood?\r\n\r\nIn the pleasing contemplation of this state of things the mind, by\r\ncomparison, carries itself back to those days of uproar and extravagance\r\nthat marked the career of the former administration, and decides, by\r\nthe unstudied impulse of its own feelings, that something must then have\r\nbeen wrong. Why was it, that America, formed for happiness, and remote\r\nby situation and circumstances from the troubles and tumults of the\r\nEuropean world, became plunged into its vortex and contaminated with its\r\ncrimes? The answer is easy. Those who were then at the head of affairs\r\nwere apostates from the principles of the revolution. Raised to an\r\nelevation they had not a right to expect, nor judgment to conduct,\r\nthey became like feathers in the air, and blown about by every puff of\r\npassion or conceit.\r\n\r\nCandour would find some apology for their conduct if want of judgment\r\nwas their only defect. But error and crime, though often alike in their\r\nfeatures, are distant in their characters and in their origin. The one\r\nhas its source in the weakness of the head, the other in the hardness\r\nof the heart, and the coalition of the two, describes the former\r\nAdministration.(1)\r\n\r\n     1 That of John Adams.--_Editor._\r\n\r\nHad no injurious consequences arisen from the conduct of that\r\nAdministration, it might have passed for error or imbecility, and\r\nbeen permitted to die and be forgotten. The grave is kind to innocent\r\noffence. But even innocence, when it is a cause of injury, ought to\r\nundergo an enquiry.\r\n\r\nThe country, during the time of the former Administration, was kept in\r\ncontinual agitation and alarm; and that no investigation might be made\r\ninto its conduct, it entrenched itself within a magic circle of terror,\r\nand called it a SEDITION LAW.(1) Violent and mysterious in its measures\r\nand arrogant in its manners, it affected to disdain information, and\r\ninsulted the principles that raised it from obscurity. John Adams and\r\nTimothy Pickering were men whom nothing but the accidents of the times\r\nrendered visible on the political horizon. Elevation turned their heads,\r\nand public indignation hath cast them to the ground. But an inquiry\r\ninto the conduct and measures of that Administration is nevertheless\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\nThe country was put to great expense. Loans, taxes, and standing armies\r\nbecame the standing order of the day. The militia, said Secretary\r\nPickering, are not to be depended upon, and fifty thousand men must be\r\nraised. For what? No cause to justify such measures has yet appeared. No\r\ndiscovery of such a cause has yet been made. The pretended Sedition Law\r\nshut up the sources of investigation, and the precipitate flight of John\r\nAdams closed the scene. But the matter ought not to sleep here.\r\n\r\nIt is not to gratify resentment, or encourage it in others, that I enter\r\nupon this subject. It is not in the power of man to accuse me of a\r\npersecuting spirit. But some explanation ought to be had. The motives\r\nand objects respecting the extraordinary and expensive measures of the\r\nformer Administration ought to be known. The Sedition Law, that shield\r\nof the moment, prevented it then, and justice demands it now. If the\r\npublic have been imposed upon, it is proper they should know it; for\r\nwhere judgment is to act, or a choice is to be made, knowledge is first\r\nnecessary. The conciliation of parties, if it does not grow out of\r\nexplanation, partakes of the character of collusion or indifference.\r\n\r\n     1 Passed July 14, 1798, to continue until March 3, 1801.\r\n     This Act, described near the close of this Letter, and one\r\n     passed June 35th, giving the President despotic powers over\r\n     aliens in the United States, constituted the famous \"Alien\r\n     and Sedition Laws.\" Hamilton opposed them, and rightly saw\r\n     in them the suicide of the Federal party.--_Editor._,\r\n\r\nThere has been guilt somewhere; and it is better to fix it where\r\nit belongs, and separate the deceiver from the deceived, than that\r\nsuspicion, the bane of society, should range at large, and sour the\r\npublic mind. The military measures that were proposed and carrying on\r\nduring the former administration, could not have for their object the\r\ndefence of the country against invasion. This is a case that decides\r\nitself; for it is self evident, that while the war raged in Europe,\r\nneither France nor England could spare a man to send to America. The\r\nobject, therefore, must be something at home, and that something was the\r\noverthrow of the representative system of government, for it could be\r\nnothing else. But the plotters got into confusion and became enemies to\r\neach other. Adams hated and was jealous of Hamilton, and Hamilton hated\r\nand despised both Adams and Washington.(1) Surly Timothy stood aloof, as\r\nhe did at the affair of Lexington, and the part that fell to the public\r\nwas to pay the expense.(2)\r\n\r\n     1 Hamilton's bitter pamphlet against Adams appeared in 1800,\r\n     but his old quarrel with Washington (1781) had apparently\r\n     healed. Yet, despite the favors lavished by Washington on\r\n     Hamilton, there is no certainty that the latter ever changed\r\n     his unfavorable opinion of the former, as expressed in a\r\n     letter to General Schuylor, Feb. 18, 1781 (Lodge's\r\n     \"Hamilton's Works,\" vol. viii., p. 35).--_Editor._\r\n\r\n     2 Colonel Pickering's failure, in 1775, to march his Salem\r\n     troops in time to intercept the British retreat from\r\n     Lexington was attributed to his half-heartedness\r\n     in the patriotic cause.--_Editor._\r\n\r\nBut ought a people who, but a few years ago, were fighting the battles\r\nof the world, for liberty had no home but here, ought such a people\r\nto stand quietly by and see that liberty undermined by apostacy\r\nand overthrown by intrigue? Let the tombs of the slain recall their\r\nrecollection, and the forethought of what their children are to be\r\nrevive and fix in their hearts the love of liberty.\r\n\r\nIf the former administration can justify its conduct, give it the\r\nopportunity. The manner in which John Adams disappeared from the\r\ngovernment renders an inquiry the more necessary. He gave some account\r\nof himself, lame and confused as it was, to certain _eastern wise men_\r\nwho came to pay homage to him on his birthday. But if he thought it\r\nnecessary to do this, ought he not to have rendered an account to\r\nthe public. They had a right to expect it of him. In that tête-à-tête\r\naccount, he says, \"Some measures were the effect of imperious necessity,\r\nmuch against my inclination.\" What measures does Mr. Adams mean, and\r\nwhat is the imperious necessity to which he alludes? \"Others (says he)\r\nwere measures of the Legislature, which, although approved when passed,\r\nwere never previously proposed or recommended by me.\" What measures,\r\nit may be asked, were those, for the public have a right to know the\r\nconduct of their representatives? \"Some (says he) left to my discretion\r\nwere never executed, because no necessity for them, in my judgment, ever\r\noccurred.\"\r\n\r\nWhat does this dark apology, mixed with accusation, amount to, but\r\nto increase and confirm the suspicion that something was wrong?\r\nAdministration only was possessed of foreign official information,\r\nand it was only upon that information communicated by him publicly or\r\nprivately, or to Congress, that Congress could act; and it is not in\r\nthe power of Mr. Adams to show, from the condition of the belligerent\r\npowers, that any imperious necessity called for the warlike and\r\nexpensive measures of his Administration.\r\n\r\nWhat the correspondence between Administration and Rufus King in London,\r\nor Quincy Adams in Holland, or Berlin, might be, is but little known.\r\nThe public papers have told us that the former became cup-bearer from\r\nthe London underwriters to Captain Truxtun,(1) for which, as Minister\r\nfrom a neutral nation, he ought to have been censured. It is, however,\r\na feature that marks the politics of the Minister, and hints at the\r\ncharacter of the correspondence.\r\n\r\n     1 Thomas Truxtun (1755-1822), for having captured the French\r\n     frigate \"L'Insurgente,\" off Hen's Island, 1799, was\r\n     presented at Lloyd's coffee-house with plate to the value of\r\n     600 guineas. Rufus King (1755-1827), made Minister to England\r\n     in 1796, continued under Adams, and for two years under\r\n     Jefferson's administration.--_Editor._\r\n\r\nI know that it is the opinion of several members of both houses of\r\nCongress, that an enquiry, with respect to the conduct of the late\r\nAdministration, ought to be gone into. The convulsed state into which\r\nthe country has been thrown will be best settled by a full and fair\r\nexposition of the conduct of that Administration, and the causes and\r\nobject of that conduct. To be deceived, or to remain deceived, can be\r\nthe interest of no man who seeks the public good; and it is the deceiver\r\nonly, or one interested in the deception, that can wish to preclude\r\nenquiry.\r\n\r\nThe suspicion against the late Administration is, that it was plotting\r\nto overturn the representative system of government, and that it spread\r\nalarms of invasions that had no foundation, as a pretence for raising\r\nand establishing a military force as the means of accomplishing that\r\nobject.\r\n\r\nThe law, called the Sedition Law, enacted, that if any person should\r\nwrite or publish, or cause to be written or published, any libel\r\n[without defining what a libel is] against the Government of the United\r\nStates, or either house of congress, or against the President, he\r\nshould be punished by a fine not exceeding two thousand dollars, and by\r\nimprisonment not exceeding two years.\r\n\r\nBut it is a much greater crime for a president to plot against a\r\nConstitution and the liberties of the people, than for an individual to\r\nplot against a President; and consequently, John Adams is accountable to\r\nthe public for his conduct, as the individuals under his administration\r\nwere to the sedition law.\r\n\r\nThe object, however, of an enquiry, in this case, is not to punish, but\r\nto satisfy; and to shew, by example, to future administrations, that an\r\nabuse of power and trust, however disguised by appearances, or rendered\r\nplausible by pretence, is one time or other to be accounted for.\r\n\r\nThomas Paine.\r\n\r\nBORDENTOWN, ON THE DELAWARE,\r\n\r\nNew Jersey, March 12, 1803. vol. III--27\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER VII.\r\n\r\n     EDITOR'S PREFACE.\r\n\r\n     This letter was printed in _The True American_, Trenton, New\r\n     Jersey, soon after Paine's return to his old home at\r\n     Bordenton. It is here printed from the original manuscript,\r\n     for which I am indebted to Mr. W. F. Havemeyer of New York.\r\n     Although the Editor has concluded to present Paine's\r\n     \"Maritime Compact\" in the form he finally gave it, the\r\n     articles were printed in French in 1800, and by S. H. Smith,\r\n     Washington, at the close of the same year. There is an\r\n     interesting history connected with it. John Hall, in his\r\n     diary (\"Trenton, 20 April, 1787\") relates that Paine told\r\n     him of Dr. Franklin, whom he (Paine) had just visited in\r\n     Philadelphia,  and the Treaty he, the Doctor, made with the\r\n     late King of Prussia by adding an article that, should war\r\n     ever break out, Commerce should be free. The Doctor said he\r\n     showed it to Vergennes, who said it met his idea, and was\r\n     such as he would make even with England. In his Address to\r\n     the People of France, 1797 (see p. 366), Paine closes with a\r\n     suggestion on the subject, and a year later (September 30,\r\n     1798), when events were in a critical condition, he sent\r\n     nine articles of his proposed _Pacte Maritime_ to\r\n     Talleyrand, newly appointed Minister of Foreign Affairs. The\r\n     letters that passed are here taken from the originals (State\r\n     Archives, Paris, États Unis, vol. 48).\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Rue Theatre française, No. 4, 9 Vendemaire, 6 year.\r\n\r\n\"Citizen Minister: I promised you some observations on the state of\r\nthings between France and America. I divide the case into two parts.\r\nFirst, with respect to some Method that shall effectually put an end to\r\nall interruptions of the American Commerce. Secondly, with respect to\r\nthe settlement for the captures that have been made on that Commerce.\r\n\r\n\"As to the first case (the interruption of the American Commerce\r\nby France) it has foundation in the British Treaty, and it is the\r\ncontinuance of that treaty that renders the remedy difficult. Besides,\r\nthe American administration has blundered so much in the business of\r\ntreaty-making, that it is probable it will blunder again in making\r\nanother with France. There is, however, one method left, and there is\r\nbut one that I can see, that will be effectual. It is a _non-importation\r\nConvention; that America agrees not to import from any Nation in Europe\r\nwho shall interrupt her Commerce on the seas, any goods, wares, or\r\nmerchandize whatever, and that all her ports shall be shut against\r\nthe Nation that gives the offence_. This will draw America out of her\r\ndifficulties with respect to her treaty with England.\r\n\r\n\"But it will be far better if this non-importation convention were to\r\nbe a general convention of Nations acting as a Whole. It would give a\r\nbetter protection to Neutral Commerce than the armed neutrality could\r\ndo. I would rather be a Neutral Nation under the protection of such a\r\nConvention, which costs nothing to make it, than be under the protection\r\nof a navy equal to that of Great Britain. France should be the patron of\r\nsuch a Convention and sign it. It would be giving both her consent and\r\nher protection to the Rights of Neutral Nations. If England refuse to\r\nsign it she will nevertheless be obliged to respect it, or lose all her\r\nCommerce.\r\n\r\n\"I enclose you a plan I drew up about four months ago, when there was\r\nexpectation that Mr. Madison would come to France. It has lain by me\r\never since.\r\n\r\n\"The second part, that of settlement for the captures, I will make the\r\nsubject of a future correspondence. Salut et respect.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTalleyrand's Reply (\"Foreign Relations, 15 Vendemaire An. 6,\" Oct.\r\n6, 1797): \"I have the honor to return you, Citizen, with very sincere\r\nthanks, your Letter to General Washington which you have had the\r\ngoodness to show me.\r\n\r\n\"I have received the letter which you have taken the trouble to write\r\nme, the 9th of this month. I need not assure you of the appreciation\r\nwith which I shall receive the further indications you promise on the\r\nmeans of terminating in a durable manner the differences which must\r\nexcite your interest as a patriot and as a Republican. Animated by\r\nsuch a principle your ideas cannot fail to throw valuable light on the\r\ndiscussion you open, and which should have for its object to reunite the\r\ntwo Republics in whose alienation the enemies of liberty triumph.\"\r\n\r\nPaine's plan made a good impression in France--He writes to Jefferson,\r\nOctober 6, 1800, that the Consul Le Brun, at an entertainment given to\r\nthe American envoys, gave for his toast: \"À l'union de 1' Amérique avec\r\nles Puissances du Nord pour faire respecter la liberté des mers.\"\r\n\r\nThe malignant mind, like the jaundiced eye, sees everything through a\r\nfalse medium of its own creating. The light of heaven appears stained\r\nwith yellow to the distempered sight of the one, and the fairest actions\r\nhave the form of crimes in the venomed imagination of the other.\r\n\r\nFor seven months, both before and after my return to America in October\r\nlast, the apostate papers styling themselves \"Federal\" were filled with\r\nparagraphs and Essays respecting a letter from Mr. Jefferson to me at\r\nParis; and though none of them knew the contents of the letter, nor the\r\noccasion of writing it, malignity taught them to suppose it, and the\r\nlying tongue of injustice lent them its aid.\r\n\r\nThat the public may no longer be imposed upon by Federal apostacy, I\r\nwill now publish the Letter, and the occasion of its being written.\r\n\r\nThe Treaty negociated in England by John Jay, and ratified by the\r\nWashington Administration, had so disgracefully surrendered the right\r\nand freedom of the American flag, that all the Commerce of the\r\nUnited States on the Ocean became exposed to capture, and suffered in\r\nconsequence of it. The duration of the Treaty was limited to two years\r\nafter the war; and consequently America could not, during that period,\r\nrelieve herself from the Chains which the Treaty had fixed upon her.\r\nThis being the case, the only relief that could come must arise out of\r\nsomething originating in Europe, that would, in its consequences, extend\r\nto America. It had long been my opinion that Commerce contained within\r\nitself the means of its own protection; but as the time for bringing\r\nforward any new system is not always happening, it is necessary to watch\r\nits approach, and lay hold of it before it passes away.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the late Emperor Paul of Russia abandoned his coalition with\r\nEngland and become a Neutral Power, this Crisis of time, and also of\r\ncircumstances, was then arriving; and I employed it in arranging a plan\r\nfor the protection of the Commerce of Neutral Nations during War,\r\nthat might, in its operation and consequences, relieve the Commerce of\r\nAmerica. The Plan, with the pieces accompanying it, consisted of\r\nabout forty pages. The Citizen Bonneville, with whom I lived in Paris,\r\ntranslated it into French; Mr. Skipwith, the American Consul, Joel\r\nBarlow, and myself, had the translation printed and distributed as\r\na present to the Foreign Ministers of all the Neutral Nations then\r\nresident in Paris. This was in the summer of 1800.\r\n\r\nIt was entitled Maritime Compact (in French _Pacte Maritime_), The plan,\r\nexclusive of the pieces that accompanied it, consisted of the following\r\nPreamble and Articles.\r\n\r\n\r\nMARITIME COMPACT.\r\n\r\nBeing an Unarmed Association of Nations for the protection of the Rights\r\nand Commerce of Nations that shall be neutral in time of War.\r\n\r\nWhereas, the Vexations and Injuries to which the Rights and Commerce of\r\nNeutral Nations have been, and continue to be, exposed during the time\r\nof maritime War, render it necessary to establish a law of Nations for\r\nthe purpose of putting an end to such vexations and Injuries, and to\r\nguarantee to the Neutral Nations the exercise of their just Rights,\r\n\r\nWe, therefore, the undersigned Powers, form ourselves into an\r\nAssociation, and establish the following as a Law of Nations on the\r\nSeas.\r\n\r\nARTICLE THE FIRST. Definition of the Rights of neutral Nations.\r\n\r\nThe Rights of Nations, such as are exercised by them in their\r\nintercourse with each other in time of Peace, are, and of right ought to\r\nbe, the Rights of Neutral Nations at all times; because,\r\n\r\nFirst, those Rights not having been abandoned by them, remain with them.\r\n\r\nSecondly, because those Rights cannot become forfeited or void, in\r\nconsequence of War breaking out between two or more other Nations.\r\n\r\nA War of Nation against Nation being exclusively the act of the Nations\r\nthat make the War, and not the act of the Neutral Nations, cannot,\r\nwhether considered in itself or in its consequences, destroy or diminish\r\nthe Rights of the Nations remaining in Peace.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE THE SECOND.\r\n\r\nThe Ships and Vessels of Nations that rest neuter and at Peace with the\r\nWorld during a War with other Nations, have a Right to navigate freely\r\non the Seas as they navigated before that War broke out, and to proceed\r\nto and enter the Port or Ports of any of the Belligerent Powers, _with\r\nthe consent of that Power_, without being seized, searched, visited, or\r\nany ways interrupted, by the Nation or Nations with which that Nation is\r\nat War.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE THE THIRD.\r\n\r\nFor the Conservation of the aforesaid Rights, We, the undersigned\r\nPowers, engaging to each other our Sacred Faith and Honour, declare,\r\n\r\nThat if any Belligerent Power shall seize, search, visit, or any ways\r\ninterrupt any Ship or Vessel belonging to the Citizens or Subjects of\r\nany of the Powers composing this Association, then each and all of the\r\nsaid undersigned Powers will cease to import, and will not permit to\r\nbe imported into the Ports or Dominions of any of the said undersigned\r\nPowers, in any Ship or Vessel whatever, any Goods, wares, or\r\nMerchandize, produced or manufactured in, or exported from, the\r\nDominions of the Power so offending against the Association hereby\r\nestablished and Proclaimed.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE THE FOURTH.\r\n\r\nThat all the Ports appertaining to any and all of the Powers composing\r\nthis Association shall be shut against the Flag of the offending Nation.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE THE FIFTH.\r\n\r\nThat no remittance or payment in Money, Merchandize, or Bills of\r\nExchange, shall be made by any of the Citizens, or Subjects, of any of\r\nthe Powers composing this Association, to the Citizens or Subjects of\r\nthe offending Nation, for the Term of one year, or until reparation\r\nbe made. The reparation to be ---- times the amount of the damages\r\nsustained.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE THE SIXTH.\r\n\r\nIf any Ship or Vessel appertaining to any of the Citizens or Subjects of\r\nany of the Powers composing this Association shall be seized, searched,\r\nvisited, or interrupted, by any Belligerent Nation, or be forcibly\r\nprevented entering the Port of her destination, or be seized, searched,\r\nvisited, or interrupted, in coming out of such Port, or be forcibly\r\nprevented from proceeding to any new destination, or be insulted or\r\nvisited by any Agent from on board any Vessel of any Belligerent Power,\r\nthe Government or Executive Power of the Nation to which the Ship or\r\nVessel so seized, searched, visited, or interrupted belongs, shall, on\r\nevidence of the fact, make public Proclamation of the same, and send\r\na Copy thereof to the Government, or Executive, of each of the Powers\r\ncomposing this Association, who shall publish the same in all the extent\r\nof his Dominions, together with a Declaration, that at the expiration\r\nof ---- days after publication, the penal articles of this Association\r\nshall be put in execution against the offending Nation.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE THE SEVENTH.\r\n\r\nIf reparation be not made within the space of one year, the said\r\nProclamation shall be renewed for one year more, and so on.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE THE EIGHTH.\r\n\r\nThe Association chooses for itself a Flag to be carried at the Mast-head\r\nconjointly with the National Flag of each Nation composing this\r\nAssociation.\r\n\r\nThe Flag of the Association shall be composed of the same colors as\r\ncompose the Rainbow, and arranged in the same order as they appear in\r\nthat Phenomenon.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE THE NINTH.\r\n\r\nAnd whereas, it may happen that one or more of the Nations composing\r\nthis Association may be, at the time of forming it, engaged in War or\r\nbecome so in future, in that case, the Ships and Vessels of such Nation\r\nshall carry the Flag of the Association bound round the Mast, to denote\r\nthat the Nation to which she belongs is a Member of the Association and\r\na respecter of its Laws.\r\n\r\nN. B. This distinction in the manner of carrying the Flag is mearly for\r\nthe purpose, that Neutral Vessels having the Flag at the Mast-head, may\r\nbe known at first sight.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE THE TENTH.\r\n\r\nAnd whereas, it is contrary to the moral principles of Neutrality and\r\nPeace, that any Neutral Nation should furnish to the Belligerent Powers,\r\nor any of them, the means of carrying on War against each other, We,\r\ntherefore, the Powers composing this Association, Declare, that we\r\nwill each one for itself, prohibit in our Dominions the exportation or\r\ntransportation of military stores, comprehending gunpowder, cannon, and\r\ncannon-balls, fire arms of all kinds, and all kinds of iron and steel\r\nweapons used in War. Excluding therefrom all kinds of Utensils and\r\nInstruments used in civil or domestic life, and every other article that\r\ncannot, in its immediate state, be employed in War.\r\n\r\nHaving thus declared the moral Motives of the foregoing Article, We\r\ndeclare also the civil and political Intention thereof, to wit,\r\n\r\nThat as Belligerent Nations have no right to visit or search any Ship or\r\nVessel belonging to a Nation at Peace, and under the protection of\r\nthe Laws and Government thereof, and as all such visit or search is an\r\ninsult to the Nation to which such Ship or Vessel belongs and to\r\nthe Government of the same, We, therefore, the Powers composing this\r\nAssociation, will take the right of prohibition on ourselves to whom it\r\nproperly belongs, and by whom only it can be legally exercised, and\r\nnot permit foreign Nations, in a state of War, to usurp the right of\r\nlegislating by Proclamation for any of the Citizens or Subjects of the\r\nPowers composing this Association.\r\n\r\nIt is, therefore, in order to take away all pretence of search or visit,\r\nwhich by being offensive might become a new cause of War, that we will\r\nprovide Laws and publish them by Proclamation, each in his own Dominion,\r\nto prohibit the supplying, or carrying to, the Belligerent Powers,\r\nor either of them, the military stores or articles before mentioned,\r\nannexing thereto a penalty to be levied or inflicted upon any persons\r\nwithin our several Dominions transgressing the same. And we invite all\r\nPersons, as well of the Belligerent Nations as of our own, or of\r\nany other, to give information of any knowledge they may have of\r\nany transgressions against the said Law, that the offenders may be\r\nprosecuted.\r\n\r\nBy this conduct we restore the word Contraband (_contra_ and _ban_) to\r\nits true and original signification, which means against Law, edict, or\r\nProclamation; and none but the Government of a Nation can have, or can\r\nexercise, the right of making Laws, edicts, or Proclamations, for the\r\nconduct of its Citizens or Subjects.\r\n\r\nNow We, the undersigned Powers, declare the aforesaid Articles to be a\r\nLaw of Nations at all times, or until a Congress of Nations shall meet\r\nto form some Law more effectual.\r\n\r\nAnd we do recommend that immediately on the breaking out of War between\r\nany two or more Nations, that Deputies be appointed by all Neutral\r\nNations, whether members of this Association or not, to meet in Congress\r\nin some central place to take cognizance of any violations of the Rights\r\nof Neutral Nations.\r\n\r\nSigned, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of giving operation to the aforesaid plan of an _unarmed\r\nAssociation_, the following Paragraph was subjoined:\r\n\r\nIt may be judged proper for the order of Business, that the Association\r\nof Nations have a President for a term of years, and the Presidency to\r\npass by rotation, to each of the parties composing the Association.\r\n\r\nIn that case, and for the sake of regularity, the first President to\r\nbe the Executive power of the most northerly Nation composing the\r\nAssociation, and his deputy or Minister at the Congress to be President\r\nof the Congress,--and the next most northerly to be Vice-president, who\r\nshall succeed to the Presidency, and so on. The line determining the\r\nGeographical situation of each, to be the latitude of the Capital of\r\neach Nation.\r\n\r\nIf this method be adopted it will be proper that the first President\r\nbe nominally constituted in order to give rotation to the rest. In that\r\ncase the following Article might be added to the foregoing, viz't. The\r\nConstitution of the Association nominates the Emperor Paul to be _first\r\nPresident_ of the Association of Nations for the protection of Neutral\r\nCommerce, and securing the freedom of the Seas.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe foregoing plan, as I have before mentioned, was presented to the\r\nMinisters of all the Neutral Nations then in Paris, in the summer of\r\n1800. Six Copies were given to the Russian General Springporten; and a\r\nRussian Gentleman who was going to Petersburgh took two expressly for\r\nthe purpose of putting them into the hands of Paul I sent the original\r\nmanuscript, in my own handwriting, to Mr. Jefferson, and also wrote him\r\nfour Letters, dated the 1st, 4th, 6th, 16th of October, 1800, giving\r\nhim an account of what was then going on in Europe respecting Neutral\r\nCommerce.\r\n\r\nThe Case was, that in order to compel the English Government to\r\nacknowledge the rights of Neutral Commerce, and that free Ships make\r\nfree Goods, the _Emperor Paul_, in the month of September following the\r\npublication of the plan, shut all the Ports of Russia against England.\r\nSweden and Denmark did the same by their Ports, and Denmark shut up\r\nHamburgh. Prussia shut up the Elbe and the Weser. The ports of Spain,\r\nPortugal, and Naples were shut up, and, in general, all the ports of\r\nItaly, except Venice, which the Emperor of Germany held; and had it not\r\nbeen for the untimely death of Paul, a _Law of Nations_, founded on the\r\nauthority of Nations, for establishing the rights of Neutral Commerce\r\nand the freedom of the Seas, would have been proclaimed, and the\r\nGovernment of England must have consented to that Law, or the Nation\r\nmust have lost its Commerce; and the consequence to America would have\r\nbeen, that such a Law would, in a great measure if not entirely, have\r\nreleased her from the injuries of Jay's Treaty.\r\n\r\nOf all these matters I informed Mr. Jefferson. This was before he was\r\nPresident, and the Letter he wrote me after he was President was in\r\nanswer to those I had written to him and the manuscript Copy of the plan\r\nI had sent here. Here follows the Letter:\r\n\r\n\r\nWashington, March 18, 1801. Dear Sir:\r\n\r\nYour letters of Oct. 1st, 4th, 6th, 16th, came duly to hand, and the\r\npapers which they covered were, according to your permission, published\r\nin the Newspapers, and in a Pamphlet, and under your own name. These\r\npapers contain precisely our principles, and I hope they will be\r\ngenerally recognized here. _Determined as we are to avoid, if possible,\r\nwasting the energies of our People in war and destruction, we shall\r\navoid implicating ourselves with the Powers of Europe, even in support\r\nof principles which we mean to pursue. They have so many other Interests\r\ndifferent from ours that we must avoid being entangled in them. We\r\nbelieve we can enforce those principles as to ourselves by Peaceable\r\nmeans, now that we are likely to have our Public Councils detached from\r\nforeign views. The return of our citizens from the phrenzy into which\r\nthey had been wrought, partly by ill conduct in France, partly by\r\nartifices practiced upon them, is almost extinct, and will, I believe,\r\nbecome quite so_, But these details, too minute and long for a Letter,\r\nwill be better developed by Mr. Dawson, the Bearer of this, a Member of\r\nthe late Congress, to whom I refer you for them. He goes in the Maryland\r\nSloop of War, which will wait a few days at Havre to receive his Letters\r\nto be written on his arrival at Paris. You expressed a wish to get a\r\npassage to this Country in a Public Vessel. Mr. Dawson is charged with\r\norders to the Captain of the Maryland to receive and accommodate you\r\nback if you can be ready to depart at such a short warning. Rob't R.\r\nLivingston is appointed Minister Plenipotentiary to the Republic of\r\nFrance, but will not leave this, till we receive the ratification of\r\nthe Convention by Mr. Dawson. I am in hopes you will find us returned\r\ngenerally to sentiments worthy of former times. In these it will be\r\nyour glory to have steadily laboured and with as much effect as any man\r\nliving. That you may long live to continue your useful Labours and to\r\nreap the reward in the thankfulness of Nations is my sincere prayer.\r\nAccept assurances of my high esteem and affectionate attachment.\r\n\r\nThomas Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis, Citizens of the United States, is the Letter about which the\r\nleaders and tools of the Federal faction, without knowing its contents\r\nor the occasion of writing it, have wasted so many malignant falsehoods.\r\nIt is a Letter which, on account of its wise economy and peaceable\r\nprinciples, and its forbearance to reproach, will be read by every good\r\nMan and every good Citizen with pleasure; and the faction, mortified at\r\nits appearance, will have to regret they forced it into publication. The\r\nleast atonement they can now offer is to make the Letter as public as\r\nthey have made their own infamy, and learn to lie no more.\r\n\r\nThe same injustice they shewed to Mr. Jefferson they shewed to me. I\r\nhad employed myself in Europe, and at my own expense, in forming and\r\npromoting a plan that would, in its operation, have benefited the\r\nCommerce of America; and the faction here invented and circulated an\r\naccount in the papers they employ, that I had given a plan to the French\r\nfor burning all the towns on the Coast from Savannah to Baltimore. Were\r\nI to prosecute them for this (and I do not promise that I will not, for\r\nthe Liberty of the Press is not the liberty of lying,) there is not a\r\nfederal judge, not even one of Midnight appointment, but must, from the\r\nnature of the case, be obliged to condemn them. The faction, however,\r\ncannot complain they have been restrained in any thing. They have had\r\ntheir full swing of lying uncontradicted; they have availed themselves,\r\nunopposed, of all the arts Hypocrisy could devise; and the event has\r\nbeen, what in all such cases it ever will and ought to be, _the ruin of\r\nthemselves_.\r\n\r\nThe Characters of the late and of the present Administrations are now\r\nsufficiently marked, and the adherents of each keep up the distinction.\r\nThe former Administration rendered itself notorious by outrage,\r\ncoxcombical parade, false alarms, a continued increase of taxes, and an\r\nunceasing clamor for War; and as every vice has a virtue opposed to\r\nit, the present Administration moves on the direct contrary line.\r\nThe question, therefore, at elections is not properly a question upon\r\nPersons, but upon principles. Those who are for Peace, moderate taxes,\r\nand mild Government, will vote for the Administration that conducts\r\nitself by those principles, in whatever hands that Administration may\r\nbe.\r\n\r\nThere are in the United States, and particularly in the middle States,\r\nseveral religious Sects, whose leading moral principle is PEACE. It is,\r\ntherefore, impossible that such Persons, consistently with the dictates\r\nof that principle, can vote for an Administration that is clamorous\r\nfor War. When moral principles, rather than Persons, are candidates for\r\nPower, to vote is to perform a moral duty, and not to vote is to neglect\r\na duty.\r\n\r\nThat persons who are hunting after places, offices, and contracts,\r\nshould be advocates for War, taxes, and extravagance, is not to be\r\nwondered at; but that so large a portion of the People who had nothing\r\nto depend upon but their Industry, and no other public prospect but that\r\nof paying taxes, and bearing the burden, should be advocates for the\r\nsame measures, is a thoughtlessness not easily accounted for. But reason\r\nis recovering her empire, and the fog of delusion is clearing away.\r\n\r\nThomas Paine.\r\n\r\nBORDENTOWN, ON THE DELAWARE,\r\n\r\nNew Jersey, April 21, 1803.(1)\r\n\r\n\r\n     1 Endorsed: \"Sent by Gen.

TO THE FRENCH INHABITANTS OF LOUISIANA.(1)\r\n\r\n     1 In a letter to Albert Gallatin, Secretary of the Treasury\r\n     (Oct 14, 1804), John Randolph of Roanoke proposed \"the\r\n     printing of -- thousand copies of Tom Paine's answer to\r\n     their remonstrance, and transmitting them by as many\r\n     thousand troops, who can speak a language perfectly\r\n     intelligible to the people of Louisiana, whatever that of\r\n     their government may be,\" The purchase of Louisiana was\r\n     announced to the Senate by President Jefferson, October 17,\r\n     1803.--Editor.\r\n\r\nA publication having the appearance of a memorial and remonstrance, to\r\nbe presented to Congress at the ensuing session, has appeared in several\r\npapers. It is therefore open to examination, and I offer you my remarks\r\nupon it. The title and introductory paragraph are as follows:\r\n\r\n\"_To the Congress of the United States in the Senate and House of\r\nRepresentatives convened_: We the subscribers, planters, merchants, and\r\nother inhabitants of Louisiana, respectfully approach the legislature\r\nof the United States with a memorial of _our rights_, a remonstrance\r\nagainst certain laws which contravene them, and a petition for\r\nthat redress to which the laws of nature, sanctioned by positive\r\nstipulations, have entitled us.\"\r\n\r\nIt often happens that when one party, or one that thinks itself a party,\r\ntalks much about its rights, it puts those of the other party upon\r\nexamining into their own, and such is the effect produced by your\r\nmemorial.\r\n\r\nA single reading of that memorial will show it is the work of some\r\nperson who is not of your people. His acquaintance with the cause,\r\ncommencement, progress, and termination of the American revolution,\r\ndecides this point; and his making our merits in that revolution the\r\nground of your claims, as if our merits could become yours, show she\r\ndoes not understand your situation.\r\n\r\nWe obtained our rights by calmly understanding principles, and by the\r\nsuccessful event of a long, obstinate, and expensive war. But it is\r\nnot incumbent on us to fight the battles of the world for the world's\r\nprofit. You are already participating, without any merit or expense in\r\nobtaining it, the blessings of freedom acquired by ourselves; and in\r\nproportion as you become initiated into the principles and practice of\r\nthe representative system of government, of which you have yet had no\r\nexperience, you will participate more, and finally be partakers of the\r\nwhole. You see what mischief ensued in France by the possession of power\r\nbefore they understood principles. They earned liberty in words, but\r\nnot in fact. The writer of this was in France through the whole of\r\nthe revolution, and knows the truth of what he speaks; for after\r\nendeavouring to give it principle, he had nearly fallen a victim to its\r\nrage.\r\n\r\nThere is a great want of judgment in the person who drew up your\r\nmemorial. He has mistaken your case, and forgotten his own; and by\r\ntrying to court your applause has injured your pretensions. He has\r\nwritten like a lawyer, straining every point that would please his\r\nclient, without studying his advantage. I find no fault with the\r\ncomposition of the memorial, for it is well written; nor with the\r\nprinciples of liberty it contains, considered in the abstract. The error\r\nlies in the misapplication of them, and in assuming a ground they have\r\nnot a right to stand upon. Instead of their serving you as a ground of\r\nreclamation against us, they change into a satire on yourselves. Why\r\ndid you not speak thus when you ought to have spoken it? We fought for\r\nliberty when you stood quiet in slavery.\r\n\r\nThe author of the memorial injudiciously confounding two distinct\r\ncases together, has spoken as if he was the memorialist of a body of\r\nAmericans, who, after sharing equally with us in all the dangers and\r\nhardships of the revolutionary war, had retired to a distance and made\r\na settlement for themselves. If, in such a situation, Congress had\r\nestablished a temporary government over them, in which they were not\r\npersonally consulted, they would have had a right to speak as the\r\nmemorial speaks. But your situation is different from what the situation\r\nof such persons would be, and therefore their ground of reclamation\r\ncannot of right become yours. You are arriving at freedom by the easiest\r\nmeans that any people ever enjoyed it; without contest, without expense,\r\nand even without any contrivance of your own. And you already so far\r\nmistake principles, that under the name of _rights_ you ask for _powers;\r\npower to import and enslave Africans_; and _to govern_ a territory that\r\n_we have purchased_.\r\n\r\nTo give colour to your memorial, you refer to the treaty of cession, (in\r\nwhich _you were not_ one of the contracting parties,) concluded at Paris\r\nbetween the governments of the United States and France.\r\n\r\n\"The third article\" you say \"of the treaty lately concluded at\r\nParis declares, that the inhabitants of the ceded territory shall be\r\nincorporated in the union of the United States, and admitted _as soon as\r\npossible, according to the principles_ of the Federal Constitution, to\r\nthe enjoyment of all the rights, advantages, and immunities of citizens\r\nof the United States; and _in the mean time_, they shall be protected\r\nin the enjoyment of their liberty, property, and the exercise of the\r\nreligion they profess.\"\r\n\r\nAs from your former condition, you cannot be much acquainted with\r\ndiplomatic policy, and I am convinced that even the gentleman who\r\ndrew up the memorial is not, I will explain to you the grounds of this\r\narticle. It may prevent your running into further errors.\r\n\r\nThe territory of Louisiana had been so often ceded to different European\r\npowers, that it became a necessary article on the part of France,\r\nand for the security of Spain, the ally of France, and which accorded\r\nperfectly with our own principles and intentions, that it should be\r\n_ceded no more_; and this article, stipulating for the incorporation of\r\nLouisiana into the union of the United States, stands as a bar against\r\nall future cession, and at the same time, as well as \"_in the mean\r\ntime_\" secures to you a civil and political permanency, personal\r\nsecurity and liberty which you never enjoyed before.\r\n\r\nFrance and Spain might suspect, (and the suspicion would not have been\r\nill-founded had the cession been treated for in the administration of\r\nJohn Adams, or when Washington was president, and Alexander Hamilton\r\npresident over him,) that we _bought_ Louisiana for the British\r\ngovernment, or with a view of selling it to her; and though such\r\nsuspicion had no just ground to stand upon with respect to our present\r\npresident, Thomas Jefferson, who is not only not a man of intrigue but\r\nwho possesses that honest pride of principle that cannot be intrigued\r\nwith, and which keeps intriguers at a distance, the article was\r\nnevertheless necessary as a precaution against future contingencies.\r\nBut you, from not knowing the political ground of the article, apply\r\nto yourselves _personally_ and _exclusively_, what had reference to the\r\n_territory_, to prevent its falling into the hands of any foreign\r\npower that might endanger the [establishment of] _Spanish_ dominion in\r\nAmerica, or those of the _French_ in the West India Islands.\r\n\r\nYou claim, (you say), to be incorporated into the union of the United\r\nStates, and your remonstrances on this subject are unjust and without\r\ncause.\r\n\r\nYou are already _incorporated_ into it as fully and effectually as the\r\nAmericans themselves are, who are settled in Louisiana. You enjoy the\r\nsame rights, privileges, advantages, and immunities, which they\r\nenjoy; and when Louisiana, or some part of it, shall be erected into a\r\nconstitutional State, you also will be citizens equal with them.\r\n\r\nYou speak in your memorial, as if you were the only people who were\r\nto live in Louisiana, and as if the territory was purchased that\r\nyou exclusively might govern it. In both these cases you are greatly\r\nmistaken. The emigrations from the United States into the purchased\r\nterritory, and the population arising therefrom, will, in a few years,\r\nexceed you in numbers. It is but twenty-six years since Kentucky\r\nbegan to be settled, and it already contains more than _double_ your\r\npopulation.\r\n\r\nIn a candid view of the case, you ask for what would be injurious to\r\nyourselves to receive, and unjust in us to grant. _Injurious_, because\r\nthe settlement of Louisiana will go on much faster under the government\r\nand guardianship of Congress, then if the government of it were\r\ncommitted to _your_ hands; and consequently, the landed property\r\nyou possessed as individuals when the treaty was concluded, or have\r\npurchased since, will increase so much faster in value.--_Unjust to\r\nourselves_, because as the reimbursements of the purchase money must\r\ncome out of the sale of the lands to new settlers, the government of it\r\ncannot suddenly go out of the hands of Congress. They are guardians of\r\nthat property for _all the people of the United States_. And besides\r\nthis, as the new settlers will be chiefly from the United States, it\r\nwould be unjust and ill policy to put them and their property under the\r\njurisdiction of a people whose freedom they had contributed to purchase.\r\nYou ought also to recollect, that the French Revolution has not\r\nexhibited to the world that grand display of principles and rights, that\r\nwould induce settlers from other countries to put themselves under a\r\nFrench jurisdiction in Louisiana. Beware of intriguers who may push you\r\non from private motives of their own.\r\n\r\nYou complain of two cases, one of which you have _no right_, no concern\r\nwith; and the other is founded in direct injustice.\r\n\r\nYou complain that Congress has passed a law to divide the country\r\ninto two territories. It is not improper to inform you, that after the\r\nrevolutionary war ended, Congress divided the territory acquired by\r\nthat war into ten territories; each of which was to be erected into a\r\nconstitutional State, when it arrived at a certain population mentioned\r\nin the Act; and, in the mean time, an officer appointed by the\r\nPresident, as the Governor of Louisiana now is, presided, as Governor\r\nof the Western Territory, over all such parts as have not arrived at\r\nthe maturity of _statehood_. Louisiana will require to be divided\r\ninto twelve States or more; but this is a matter that belongs to _the\r\npurchaser_ of the territory of Louisiana, and with which the inhabitants\r\nof the town of New-Orleans have no right to interfere; and beside this,\r\nit is probable that the inhabitants of the other territory would choose\r\nto be independent of New-Orleans. They might apprehend, that on some\r\nspeculating pretence, their produce might be put in requisition, and a\r\nmaximum price put on it--a thing not uncommon in a French government.\r\nAs a general rule, without refining upon sentiment, one may put\r\nconfidence in the justice of those who have no inducement to do us\r\ninjustice; and this is the case Congress stands in with respect to both\r\nterritories, and to all other divisions that may be laid out, and to all\r\ninhabitants and settlers, of whatever nation they may be.\r\n\r\nThere can be no such thing as what the memorial speaks of, that is, _of\r\na Governor appointed by the President who may have no interest in the\r\nwelfare of Louisiana_. He must, from the nature of the case, have more\r\ninterest in it than any other person can have. He is entrusted with the\r\ncare of an extensive tract of country, now the property of the United\r\nStates by purchase. The value of those lands will depend on the\r\nincreasing prosperity of Louisiana, its agriculture, commerce, and\r\npopulation. You have only a local and partial interest in the town of\r\nNew-Orleans, or its vicinity; and if, in consequence of exploring the\r\ncountry, new seats of commerce should offer, his general interest would\r\nlead him to open them, and your partial interest to shut them up.\r\n\r\nThere is probably some justice in your remark, as it applies to the\r\ngovernments under which you _formerly_ lived. Such governments\r\nalways look with jealousy, and an apprehension of revolt, on colonies\r\nincreasing in prosperity and population, and they send governors to\r\n_keep them down_. But when you argue from the conduct of governments\r\n_distant and despotic_, to that of _domestic_ and _free_ government, it\r\nshows you do not understand the principles and interest of a Republic,\r\nand to put you right is friendship. We have had experience, and you have\r\nnot.\r\n\r\nThe other case to which I alluded, as being founded in direct injustice,\r\nis that in which you petition for _power_, under the name of _rights_,\r\nto import and enslave Africans!\r\n\r\n_Dare you put up a petition to Heaven for such a power, without fearing\r\nto be struck from the earth by its justice?_\r\n\r\n_Why, then, do you ask it of man against man?_\r\n\r\n_Do you want to renew in Louisiana the horrors of Domingo?_\r\n\r\n\r\nCommon Sense.\r\n\r\nSept 22, 1804.\r\n\r\n\r\nEND OF VOLUME III.",
