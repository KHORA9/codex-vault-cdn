Sometimes these gifts\r\nseem to come to us from our forefathers, but more often it is difficult\r\nto trace their origin.\r\n\r\nA goatherd, perhaps, amuses himself by counting little pebbles and\r\ndoing sums with them. He becomes an astoundingly quick reckoner, and in\r\nthe end is a professor of mathematics. Another boy, at an age when most\r\nof us care only for play, leaves his schoolfellows at their games and\r\nlistens to the imaginary sounds of an organ, a secret concert heard by\r\nhim alone. He has a genius for music. A third—so small, perhaps, that\r\nhe cannot eat his bread and jam without smearing his face—takes a keen\r\ndelight in fashioning clay into little figures that are amazingly\r\nlifelike. If he be fortunate he will some day be a famous sculptor.\r\n\r\nTo talk about oneself is hateful, I know, but perhaps I may be allowed\r\nto do so for a moment, in order to introduce myself and my studies.\r\n\r\nFrom my earliest childhood I have felt drawn towards the things of\r\nNature. It would be ridiculous to suppose that this gift, this love of\r\nobserving plants and insects, was inherited from my ancestors, who were\r\nuneducated people of the soil and observed little but their own cows\r\nand sheep. Of my four grandparents only one ever opened a book, and\r\neven he was very uncertain about his spelling. Nor do I owe anything to\r\na scientific training. Without masters, without guides, often without\r\nbooks, I have gone forward with one aim always before me: to add a few\r\npages to the history of insects.\r\n\r\nAs I look back—so many years back!—I can see myself as a tiny boy,\r\nextremely proud of my first braces and of my attempts to learn the\r\nalphabet. And very well I remember the delight of finding my first\r\nbird’s nest and gathering my first mushroom.\r\n\r\nOne day I was climbing a hill. At the top of it was a row of trees that\r\nhad long interested me very much. From the little window at home I\r\ncould see them against the sky, tossing before the wind or writhing\r\nmadly in the snow, and I wished to have a closer view of them. It was a\r\nlong climb—ever so long; and my legs were very short. I clambered up\r\nslowly and tediously, for the grassy slope was as steep as a roof.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, at my feet, a lovely bird flew out from its hiding-place\r\nunder a big stone. In a moment I had found the nest, which was made of\r\nhair and fine straw, and had six eggs laid side by side in it. The eggs\r\nwere a magnificent azure blue, very bright. This was the first nest I\r\never found, the first of the many joys which the birds were to bring\r\nme. Overpowered with pleasure, I lay down on the grass and stared at\r\nit.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the mother-bird was flying about uneasily from stone to\r\nstone, crying ”Tack! Tack!” in a voice of the greatest anxiety. I was\r\ntoo small to understand what she was suffering. I made a plan worthy of\r\na little beast of prey. I would carry away just one of the pretty blue\r\neggs as a trophy, and then, in a fortnight, I would come back and take\r\nthe tiny birds before they could fly away. Fortunately, as I walked\r\ncarefully home, carrying my blue egg on a bed of moss, I met the\r\npriest.\r\n\r\n“Ah!” said he. “A Saxicola’s egg! Where did you get it?”\r\n\r\nI told him the whole story. “I shall go back for the others,” I said,\r\n“when the young birds have got their quill-feathers.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, but you mustn’t do that!” cried the priest.\r\n\r\n“You mustn’t be so cruel as to rob the poor mother of all her little\r\nbirds. Be a good boy, now, and promise not to touch the nest.”\r\n\r\nFrom this conversation I learnt two things: first, that robbing birds’\r\nnests is cruel and, secondly, that birds and beasts have names just\r\nlike ourselves.\r\n\r\n“What are the names of all my friends in the woods and meadows?” I\r\nasked myself. “And what does Saxicola mean?” Years later I learnt that\r\nSaxicola means an inhabitant of the rocks. My bird with the blue eggs\r\nwas a Stone-chat.\r\n\r\nBelow our village there ran a little brook, and beyond the brook was a\r\nspinney of beeches with smooth, straight trunks, like pillars. The\r\nground was padded with moss. It was in this spinney that I picked my\r\nfirst mushroom, which looked, when I caught sight of it, like an egg\r\ndropped on the moss by some wandering hen. There were many others\r\nthere, of different sizes, forms, and colours. Some were shaped like\r\nbells, some like extinguishers, some like cups: some were broken, and\r\nwere weeping tears of milk: some became blue when I trod on them.\r\nOthers, the most curious of all, were like pears with a round hole at\r\nthe top—a sort of chimney whence a whiff of smoke escaped when I\r\nprodded their under-side with my finger. I filled my pockets with\r\nthese, and made them smoke at my leisure, till at last they were\r\nreduced to a kind of tinder.\r\n\r\nMany a time I returned to that delightful spinney, and learnt my first\r\nlessons in mushroom-lore in the company of the Crows. My collections, I\r\nneed hardly say, were not admitted to the house.\r\n\r\nIn this way—by observing Nature and making experiments—nearly all my\r\nlessons have been learnt: all except two, in fact. I have received from\r\nothers two lessons of a scientific character, and two only, in the\r\nwhole course of my life: one in anatomy and one in chemistry.\r\n\r\nI owe the first to the learned naturalist Moquin-Tandon, who showed me\r\nhow to explore the interior of a Snail in a plate filled with water.\r\nThe lesson was short and fruitful. [1]\r\n\r\nMy first introduction to chemistry was less fortunate. It ended in the\r\nbursting of a glass vessel, with the result that most of my\r\nfellow-pupils were hurt, one of them nearly lost his sight, the\r\nlecturer’s clothes were burnt to pieces, and the wall of the\r\nlecture-room was splashed with stains. Later on, when I returned to\r\nthat room, no longer as a pupil but as a master, the splashes were\r\nstill there. On that occasion I learnt one thing at least. Ever after,\r\nwhen I made experiments of that kind, I kept my pupils at a distance.\r\n\r\nIt has always been my great desire to have a laboratory in the open\r\nfields—not an easy thing to obtain when one lives in a state of\r\nconstant anxiety about one’s daily bread. For forty years it was my\r\ndream to own a little bit of land, fenced in for the sake of privacy: a\r\ndesolate, barren, sun-scorched bit of land, overgrown with thistles and\r\nmuch beloved by Wasps and Bees. Here, without fear of interruption, I\r\nmight question the Hunting-wasps and others of my friends in that\r\ndifficult language which consists of experiments and observations.\r\nHere, without the long expeditions and rambles that use up my time and\r\nstrength, I might watch my insects at every hour of the day.\r\n\r\nAnd then, at last, my wish was fulfilled. I obtained a bit of land in\r\nthe solitude of a little village. It was a harmas, which is the name we\r\ngive in this part of Provence to an untilled, pebbly expanse where\r\nhardly any plant but thyme can grow. It is too poor to be worth the\r\ntrouble of ploughing, but the sheep pass there in spring, when it has\r\nchanced to rain and a little grass grows up.\r\n\r\nMy own particular harmas, however, had a small quantity of red earth\r\nmixed with the stones, and had been roughly cultivated. I was told that\r\nvines once grew here, and I was sorry, for the original vegetation had\r\nbeen driven out by the three-pronged fork. There was no thyme left, nor\r\nlavender, nor a single clump of the dwarf oak. As thyme and lavender\r\nmight be useful to me as a hunting-ground for Bees and Wasps, I was\r\nobliged to plant them again.\r\n\r\nThere were plenty of weeds: couch-grass, and prickly centauries, and\r\nthe fierce Spanish oyster-plant, with its spreading orange flowers and\r\nspikes strong as nails. Above it towered the Illyrian cotton-thistle,\r\nwhose straight and solitary stalk grows sometimes to the height of six\r\nfeet and ends in large pink tufts. There were smaller thistles too, so\r\nwell armed that the plant-collector can hardly tell where to grasp\r\nthem, and spiky knapweeds, and in among them, in long lines provided\r\nwith hooks, the shoots of the blue dewberry creeping along the ground.\r\nIf you had visited this prickly thicket without wearing high boots, you\r\nwould have paid dearly for your rashness!\r\n\r\nSuch was the Eden that I won by forty years of desperate struggle.\r\n\r\nThis curious, barren Paradise of mine is the happy hunting-ground of\r\ncountless Bees and Wasps. Never have I seen so large a population of\r\ninsects at a single spot. All the trades have made it their centre.\r\nHere come hunters of every kind of game, builders in clay,\r\ncotton-weavers, leaf-cutters, architects in pasteboard, plasterers\r\nmixing mortar, carpenters boring wood, miners digging underground\r\ngalleries, workers in gold-beaters’ skin, and many more.\r\n\r\nSee—here is a Tailor-bee. She scrapes the cobwebby stalk of the\r\nyellow-flowered centaury, and gathers a ball of wadding which she\r\ncarries off proudly with her mandibles or jaws. She will turn it,\r\nunderground, into cotton satchels to hold the store of honey and the\r\neggs. And here are the Leaf-cutting Bees, carrying their black, white,\r\nor blood-red reaping brushes under their bodies. They will visit the\r\nneighbouring shrubs, and there cut from the leaves oval pieces in which\r\nto wrap their harvest. Here too are the black, velvet-clad Mason-bees,\r\nwho work with cement and gravel. We could easily find specimens of\r\ntheir masonry on the stones in the harmas. Next comes a kind of Wild\r\nBee who stacks her cells in the winding staircase of an empty\r\nsnail-shell; and another who lodges her grubs in the pith of a dry\r\nbramble-stalk; and a third who uses the channel of a cut reed; and a\r\nfourth who lives rent-free in the vacant galleries of some Mason-bee.\r\nThere are also Bees with horns, and Bees with brushes on their\r\nhind-legs, to be used for reaping.\r\n\r\nWhile the walls of my harmas were being built some great heaps of\r\nstones and mounds of sand were scattered here and there by the\r\nbuilders, and were soon occupied by a variety of inhabitants. The\r\nMason-bees chose the chinks between the stones for their\r\nsleeping-place. The powerful Eyed Lizard, who, when hard pressed,\r\nattacks both man and dog, selected a cave in which to lie in wait for\r\nthe passing Scarab, or Sacred Beetle. The Black-eared Chat, who looks\r\nlike a Dominican monk in his white-and-black raiment, sat on the top\r\nstone singing his brief song. His nest, with the sky-blue eggs, must\r\nhave been somewhere in the heap. When the stones were moved the little\r\nDominican moved too. I regret him: he would have been a charming\r\nneighbour. The Eyed Lizard I do not regret at all.\r\n\r\nThe sand-heaps sheltered a colony of Digger-wasps and Hunting-wasps,\r\nwho were, to my sorrow, turned out at last by the builders. But still\r\nthere are hunters left: some who flutter about in search of\r\nCaterpillars, and one very large kind of Wasp who actually has the\r\ncourage to hunt the Tarantula. Many of these mighty Spiders have their\r\nburrows in the harmas, and you can see their eyes gleaming at the\r\nbottom of the den like little diamonds. On hot summer afternoons you\r\nmay also see Amazon-ants, who leave their barracks in long battalions\r\nand march far afield to hunt for slaves.\r\n\r\nNor are these all. The shrubs about the house are full of birds,\r\nWarblers and Greenfinches, Sparrows and Owls; while the pond is so\r\npopular with the Frogs that in May it becomes a deafening orchestra.\r\nAnd boldest of all, the Wasp has taken possession of the house itself.\r\nOn my doorway lives the White-banded Sphex: when I go indoors I must be\r\ncareful not to tread upon her as she carries on her work of mining.\r\nJust within a closed window a kind of Mason-wasp has made her\r\nearth-built nest upon the freestone wall. To enter her home she uses a\r\nlittle hole left by accident in the shutters. On the mouldings of the\r\nVenetian blinds a few stray Mason-bees build their cells. The Common\r\nWasp and the Solitary Wasp visit me at dinner. The object of their\r\nvisit, apparently, is to see if my grapes are ripe.\r\n\r\nSuch are my companions. My dear beasts, my friends of former days and\r\nother more recent acquaintances, are all here, hunting, and building,\r\nand feeding their families. And if I wish for change the mountain is\r\nclose to me, with its tangle of arbutus, and rock-roses, and heather,\r\nwhere Wasps and Bees delight to gather. And that is why I deserted the\r\ntown for the village, and came to Sérignan to weed my turnips and water\r\nmy lettuces.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE SACRED BEETLE\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nTHE BALL\r\n\r\nIt is six or seven thousand years since the Sacred Beetle was first\r\ntalked about. The peasant of ancient Egypt, as he watered his patch of\r\nonions in the spring, would see from time to time a fat black insect\r\npass close by, hurriedly trundling a ball backwards. He would watch the\r\nqueer rolling thing in amazement, as the peasant of Provence watches it\r\nto this day.\r\n\r\nThe early Egyptians fancied that this ball was a symbol of the earth,\r\nand that all the Scarab’s actions were prompted by the movements of the\r\nheavenly bodies. So much knowledge of astronomy in a Beetle seemed to\r\nthem almost divine, and that is why he is called the Sacred Beetle.\r\nThey also thought that the ball he rolled on the ground contained the\r\negg, and that the young Beetle came out of it. But as a matter of fact,\r\nit is simply his store of food.\r\n\r\nIt is not at all nice food. For the work of this Beetle is to scour the\r\nfilth from the surface of the soil. The ball he rolls so carefully is\r\nmade of his sweepings from the roads and fields.\r\n\r\nThis is how he sets about it. The edge of his broad, flat head is\r\nnotched with six teeth arranged in a semi-circle, like a sort of curved\r\nrake; and this he uses for digging and cutting up, for throwing aside\r\nthe stuff he does not want, and scraping together the food he chooses.\r\nHis bow-shaped fore-legs are also useful tools, for they are very\r\nstrong, and they too have five teeth on the outside. So if a vigorous\r\neffort be needed to remove some obstacle the Scarab makes use of his\r\nelbows, that is to say he flings his toothed legs to right and left,\r\nand clears a space with an energetic sweep. Then he collects armfuls of\r\nthe stuff he has raked together, and pushes it beneath him, between the\r\nfour hinder-legs. These are long and slender, especially the last pair,\r\nslightly bowed and finished with a sharp claw. The Beetle then presses\r\nthe stuff against his body with his hind-legs, curving it and spinning\r\nit round and round till it forms a perfect ball. In a moment a tiny\r\npellet grows to the size of a walnut, and soon to that of an apple. I\r\nhave seen some gluttons manufacture a ball as big as a man’s fist.\r\n\r\nWhen the ball of provisions is ready it must be moved to a suitable\r\nplace. The Beetle begins the journey. He clasps the ball with his long\r\nhind-legs and walks with his fore-legs, moving backwards with his head\r\ndown and his hind-quarters in the air. He pushes his load behind him by\r\nalternate thrusts to right and left. One would expect him to choose a\r\nlevel road, or at least a gentle incline. Not at all! Let him find\r\nhimself near some steep slope, impossible to climb, and that is the\r\nvery path the obstinate creature will attempt. The ball, that enormous\r\nburden, is painfully hoisted step by step, with infinite precautions,\r\nto a certain height, always backwards. Then by some rash movement all\r\nthis toil is wasted: the ball rolls down, dragging the Beetle with it.\r\nOnce more the heights are climbed, and another fall is the result.\r\nAgain and again the insect begins the ascent. The merest trifle ruins\r\neverything; a grass-root may trip him up or a smooth bit of gravel make\r\nhim slip, and down come ball and Beetle, all mixed up together. Ten or\r\ntwenty times he will start afresh, till at last he is successful, or\r\nelse sees the hopelessness of his efforts and resigns himself to taking\r\nthe level road.\r\n\r\nSometimes the Scarab seems to enter into partnership with a friend.\r\nThis is the way in which it usually happens. When the Beetle’s ball is\r\nready he leaves the crowd of workers, pushing his prize backwards. A\r\nneighbour, whose own task is hardly begun, suddenly drops his work and\r\nruns to the moving ball, to lend a hand to the owner. His aid seems to\r\nbe accepted willingly. But the new-comer is not really a partner: he is\r\na robber. To make one’s own ball needs hard work and patience; to steal\r\none ready-made, or to invite oneself to a neighbour’s dinner, is much\r\neasier. Some thieving Beetles go to work craftily, others use violence.\r\n\r\nSometimes a thief comes flying up, knocks over the owner of the ball,\r\nand perches himself on top of it. With his fore-legs crossed over his\r\nbreast, ready to hit out, he awaits events. If the owner raises himself\r\nto seize his ball the robber gives him a blow that stretches him on his\r\nback. Then the owner gets up and shakes the ball till it begins\r\nrolling, and perhaps the thief falls off. A wrestling-match follows.\r\nThe two Beetles grapple with one another: their legs lock and unlock,\r\ntheir joints intertwine, their horny armour clashes and grates with the\r\nrasping sound of metal under a file. The one who is successful climbs\r\nto the top of the ball, and after two or three attempts to dislodge him\r\nthe defeated Scarab goes off to make himself a new pellet. I have\r\nsometimes seen a third Beetle appear, and rob the robber.\r\n\r\nBut sometimes the thief bides his time and trusts to cunning. He\r\npretends to help the victim to roll the food along, over sandy plains\r\nthick with thyme, over cart-ruts and steep places, but he really does\r\nvery little of the work, preferring to sit on the ball and do nothing.\r\nWhen a suitable place for a burrow is reached the rightful owner begins\r\nto dig with his sharp-edged forehead and toothed legs, flinging armfuls\r\nof sand behind him, while the thief clings to the ball, shamming dead.\r\nThe cave grows deeper and deeper, and the working Scarab disappears\r\nfrom view. Whenever he comes to the surface he glances at the ball, on\r\nwhich the other lies, demure and motionless, inspiring confidence. But\r\nas the absences of the owner become longer the thief seizes his chance,\r\nand hurriedly makes off with the ball, which he pushes behind him with\r\nthe speed of a pickpocket afraid of being caught. If the owner catches\r\nhim, as sometimes happens, he quickly changes his position, and seems\r\nto plead as an excuse that the pellet rolled down the slope, and he was\r\nonly trying to stop it! And the two bring the ball back as though\r\nnothing had happened.\r\n\r\nIf the thief has managed to get safely away, however, the owner can\r\nonly resign himself to his loss, which he does with admirable\r\nfortitude. He rubs his cheeks, sniffs the air, flies off, and begins\r\nhis work all over again. I admire and envy his character.\r\n\r\nAt last his provisions are safely stored. His burrow is a shallow hole\r\nabout the size of a man’s fist, dug in soft earth or sand, with a short\r\npassage to the surface, just wide enough to admit the ball. As soon as\r\nhis food is rolled into this burrow the Scarab shuts himself in by\r\nstopping up the entrance with rubbish. The ball fills almost the whole\r\nroom: the banquet rises from floor to ceiling. Only a narrow passage\r\nruns between it and the walls, and here sit the banqueters, two at\r\nmost, very often only one. Here the Sacred Beetle feasts day and night,\r\nfor a week or a fortnight at a time, without ceasing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nTHE PEAR\r\n\r\nAs I have already said, the ancient Egyptians thought that the egg of\r\nthe Sacred Beetle was within the ball that I have been describing. I\r\nhave proved that it is not so. One day I discovered the truth about the\r\nScarab’s egg.\r\n\r\nA young shepherd who helps me in his spare time came to me one Sunday\r\nin June with a queer thing in his hand. It was exactly like a tiny pear\r\nthat had lost all its fresh colour and had turned brown in rotting. It\r\nwas firm to the touch and very graceful in shape, though the materials\r\nof which it was formed seemed none too nicely chosen. The shepherd\r\nassured me there was an egg inside it; for a similar pear, crushed by\r\naccident in the digging, had contained a white egg the size of a grain\r\nof wheat.\r\n\r\nAt daybreak the next morning the shepherd and I went out to investigate\r\nthe matter. We met among the browsing sheep, on some slopes that had\r\nlately been cleared of trees.\r\n\r\nA Sacred Beetle’s burrow is soon found: you can tell it by the fresh\r\nlittle mound of earth above it. My companion dug vigorously into the\r\nground with my pocket trowel, while I lay down, the better to see what\r\nwas being unearthed. A cave opened out, and there I saw, lying in the\r\nmoist earth, a splendid pear upon the ground. I shall not soon forget\r\nmy first sight of the mother Beetle’s wonderful work. My excitement\r\ncould have been no greater had I, in digging among the relics of\r\nancient Egypt, found the sacred insect carved in emerald.\r\n\r\nWe went on with our search, and found a second hole. Here, by the side\r\nof the pear and fondly embracing it, was the mother Beetle, engaged no\r\ndoubt in giving it the finishing touches before leaving the burrow for\r\ngood. There was no possible doubt that the pear was the nest of the\r\nScarab. In the course of the summer I found at least a hundred such\r\nnests.\r\n\r\nThe pear, like the ball, is formed of refuse scraped up in the fields,\r\nbut the materials are less coarse, because they are intended for the\r\nfood of the grub. When it comes out of the egg it is incapable of\r\nsearching for its own meals, so the mother arranges that it shall find\r\nitself surrounded by the food that suits it best. It can begin eating\r\nat once, without further trouble.\r\n\r\nThe egg is laid in the narrow end of the pear. Every germ of life,\r\nwhether of plant or animal, needs air: even the shell of a bird’s egg\r\nis riddled with an endless number of pores. If the germ of the Scarab\r\nwere in the thick part of the pear it would be smothered, because there\r\nthe materials are very closely packed, and are covered with a hard\r\nrind. So the mother Beetle prepares a nice airy room with thin walls\r\nfor her little grub to live in, during its first moments. There is a\r\ncertain amount of air even in the very centre of the pear, but not\r\nenough for a delicate baby-grub. By the time he has eaten his way to\r\nthe centre he is strong enough to manage with very little air.\r\n\r\nThere is, of course, a good reason for the hardness of the shell that\r\ncovers the big end of the pear. The Scarab’s burrow is extremely hot:\r\nsometimes the temperature reaches boiling point. The provisions, even\r\nthough they have to last only three or four weeks, are liable to dry up\r\nand become uneatable. When, instead of the soft food of its first meal,\r\nthe unhappy grub finds nothing to eat but horrible crusty stuff as hard\r\nas a pebble, it is bound to die of hunger. I have found numbers of\r\nthese victims of the August sun. The poor things are baked in a sort of\r\nclosed oven. To lessen this danger the mother Beetle compresses the\r\nouter layer of the pear—or nest—with all the strength of her stout,\r\nflat fore-arms, to turn it into a protecting rind like the shell of a\r\nnut. This helps to ward off the heat. In the hot summer months the\r\nhousewife puts her bread into a closed pan to keep it fresh. The insect\r\ndoes the same in its own fashion: by dint of pressure it covers the\r\nfamily bread with a pan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have watched the Sacred Beetle at work in her den, so I know how she\r\nmakes her pear-shaped nest.\r\n\r\nWith the building-materials she has collected she shuts herself up\r\nunderground so as to give her whole attention to the business in hand.\r\nThe materials may be obtained in two ways. As a rule, under natural\r\nconditions, she kneads a ball in the usual way and rolls it to a\r\nfavourable spot. As it rolls along it hardens a little on the surface\r\nand gathers a slight crust of earth and tiny grains of sand, which is\r\nuseful later on. Now and then, however, the Beetle finds a suitable\r\nplace for her burrow quite close to the spot where she collects her\r\nbuilding-materials, and in that case she simply bundles armfuls of\r\nstuff into the hole. The result is most striking. One day I see a\r\nshapeless lump disappear into the burrow. Next day, or the day after, I\r\nvisit the Beetle’s workshop and find the artist in front of her work.\r\nThe formless mass of scrapings has become a pear, perfect in outline\r\nand exquisitely finished.\r\n\r\nThe part that rests on the floor of the burrow is crusted over with\r\nparticles of sand, while the rest is polished like glass. This shows\r\nthat the Beetle has not rolled the pear round and round, but has shaped\r\nit where it lies. She has modelled it with little taps of her broad\r\nfeet, just as she models her ball in the daylight.\r\n\r\nBy making an artificial burrow for the mother Beetle in my own\r\nworkshop, with the help of a glass jar full of earth, and a peep-hole\r\nthrough which I can observe operations, I have been able to see the\r\nwork in its various stages.\r\n\r\nThe Beetle first makes a complete ball. Then she starts the neck of the\r\npear by making a ring round the ball and applying pressure, till the\r\nring becomes a groove. In this way a blunt projection is pushed out at\r\none side of the ball. In the centre of this projection she employs\r\nfurther pressure to form a sort of crater or hollow, with a swollen\r\nrim; and gradually the hollow is made deeper and the swollen rim\r\nthinner and thinner, till a sack is formed. In this sack, which is\r\npolished and glazed inside, the egg is laid. The opening of the sack,\r\nor extreme end of the pear, is then closed with a plug of stringy\r\nfibres.\r\n\r\nThere is a reason for this rough plug—a most curious exception, when\r\nnothing else has escaped the heavy blows of the insect’s leg. The end\r\nof the egg rests against it, and, if the stopper were pressed down and\r\ndriven in, the infant grub might suffer. So the Beetle stops the hole\r\nwithout ramming down the stopper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nTHE GROWING-UP OF THE SCARAB\r\n\r\nAbout a week or ten days after the laying of the egg, the grub is\r\nhatched, and without delay begins to eat its house. It is a grub of\r\nremarkable wisdom, for it always starts its meal with the thickest part\r\nof the walls, and so avoids making a hole through which it might fall\r\nout of the pear altogether. It soon becomes fat; and indeed it is an\r\nungainly creature at best, with an enormous hump on its back, and a\r\nskin so transparent that if you hold it up to the light you can see its\r\ninternal organs. If the early Egyptian had chanced upon this plump\r\nwhite grub he would never have suspected it to contain, in an\r\nundeveloped state, the sober beauty of the Scarab!\r\n\r\nWhen first it sheds its skin the insect that appears is not a\r\nfull-grown Scarab, though all the Scarab’s features can be recognised.\r\nThere are few insects so beautiful as this delicate creature with its\r\nwing-cases living in front of it like a wide pleated scarf and its\r\nfore-legs folded under its head. Half transparent and as yellow as\r\nhoney, it looks as though it were carved from a block of amber. For\r\nfour weeks it remains in this state, and then it too casts its skin.\r\n\r\nIts colouring now is red-and-white,—so many times does the Sacred\r\nBeetle change its garments before it finally appears black as ebony! As\r\nit grows blacker it also grows harder, till it is covered with horny\r\narmour and is a full-grown Beetle.\r\n\r\nAll this time he is underground, in the pear-shaped nest. Great is his\r\nlonging to burst the shell of his prison and come into the sunshine.\r\nWhether he succeeds in doing so depends on circumstances.\r\n\r\nIt is generally August when he is ready for release, and August as a\r\nrule is the driest and hottest month of the year. If therefore no rain\r\nfalls to soften the earth, the cell to be burst and the wall to be\r\nbroken defy the strength of the insect, which is helpless against all\r\nthat hardness. The soft material of the nest has become an impassable\r\nrampart; it has turned into a sort of brick, baked in the kiln of\r\nsummer.\r\n\r\nI have, of course, made experiments on insects that are ready to be\r\nreleased. I lay the hard, dry shells in a box where they remain dry;\r\nand sooner or later I hear a sharp, grating sound inside each cell. It\r\nis the prisoner scraping the wall with the rakes on his forehead and\r\nhis fore-feet. Two or three days pass, and no progress seems to have\r\nbeen made.\r\n\r\nI try to help a couple of them by opening a loophole with my knife; but\r\nthese favoured ones make no more progress than the others.\r\n\r\nIn less than a fortnight silence reigns in all the shells. The\r\nprisoners, worn out with their efforts, have all died.\r\n\r\nThen I take some other shells, as hard as the first, wrap them in a wet\r\nrag, and put them in a corked flask. When the moisture has soaked\r\nthrough them I rid them of the wrapper, but keep them in the flask.\r\nThis time the experiment is a complete success. Softened by the wet the\r\nshells are burst by the prisoner, who props himself boldly on his legs,\r\nusing his back as a lever, or else scrapes away at one point till the\r\nwalls crumble to pieces. In every case the Beetle is released.\r\n\r\nIn natural conditions, when the shells remain underground, the same\r\nthing occurs. When the soil is burnt by the August sun it is impossible\r\nfor the insect to wear away his prison, which is hard as a brick. But\r\nwhen a shower comes the shell recovers the softness of its early days:\r\nthe insect struggles with his legs and pushes with his back, and so\r\nbecomes free.\r\n\r\nAt first he shows no interest in food. What he wants above all is the\r\njoy of the light. He sets himself in the sun, and there, motionless,\r\nbasks in the warmth.\r\n\r\nPresently, however, he wishes to eat. With no one to teach him, he sets\r\nto work, exactly like his elders, to make himself a ball of food. He\r\ndigs his burrow and stores it with provisions. Without ever learning\r\nit, he knows his trade to perfection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE CICADA\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nTHE CICADA AND THE ANT\r\n\r\nTo most of us the Cicada’s song is unknown, for he lives in the land of\r\nthe olive-trees. But every one who has read La Fontaine’s “Fables” has\r\nheard of the snub the Cicada received from the Ant, though La Fontaine\r\nwas not the first to tell the tale.\r\n\r\nThe Cicada, says the story, did nothing but sing all through the\r\nsummer, while the Ants were busy storing their provisions. When winter\r\ncame he was hungry, and hurried to his neighbour to borrow some food.\r\nHe met with a poor welcome.\r\n\r\n“Why didn’t you gather your food in the summer?” asked the prudent Ant.\r\n\r\n“I was busy singing all the summer,” said the Cicada.\r\n\r\n“Singing, were you?” answered the Ant unkindly. “Well, then, now you\r\nmay dance!” And she turned her back on the beggar.\r\n\r\nNow the insect in this fable could not possibly be a Cicada. La\r\nFontaine, it is plain, was thinking of the Grasshopper and as a matter\r\nof fact the English translations usually substitute a Grasshopper for\r\nthe Cicada.\r\n\r\nFor my village does not contain a peasant so ignorant as to imagine the\r\nCicada ever exists in winter. Every tiller of the soil is familiar with\r\nthe grub of this insect, which he turns over with his spade whenever he\r\nbanks up the olive-trees at the approach of cold weather. A thousand\r\ntimes he has seen the grub leave the ground through a round hole of its\r\nown making, fasten itself to a twig, split its own back, take off its\r\nskin, and turn into a Cicada.\r\n\r\nThe fable is a slander. The Cicada is no beggar, though it is true that\r\nhe demands a good deal of attention from his neighbours. Every summer\r\nhe comes and settles in his hundreds outside my door, amid the greenery\r\nof two tall plane-trees; and here, from sunrise to sunset, he tortures\r\nmy head with the rasping of his harsh music. This deafening concert,\r\nthis incessant rattling and drumming, makes all thought impossible.\r\n\r\nIt is true, too, that there are sometimes dealings between the Cicada\r\nand the Ant; but they are exactly the opposite of those described in\r\nthe fable. The Cicada is never dependent on others for his living. At\r\nno time does he go crying famine at the doors of the Ant-hills. On the\r\ncontrary, it is the Ant who, driven by hunger, begs and entreats the\r\nsinger. Entreats, did I say? It is not the right word. She brazenly\r\nrobs him.\r\n\r\nIn July, when most of the insects in my sunny country are parched with\r\nthirst, and vainly wander round the withered flowers in search of\r\nrefreshment, the Cicada remains perfectly cheerful. With his\r\nrostrum—the delicate sucker, sharp as a gimlet, that he carries on his\r\nchest—he broaches a cask in his inexhaustible cellar. Sitting, always\r\nsinging, on the branch of a shrub, he bores through the firm, smooth\r\nbark, which is swollen with sap. Driving his sucker through the\r\nbunghole, he drinks his fill.\r\n\r\nIf I watch him for a little while I may perhaps see him in unexpected\r\ntrouble. There are many thirsty insects in the neighbourhood, who soon\r\ndiscover the sap that oozes from the Cicada’s well. They hasten up, at\r\nfirst quietly and discreetly, to lick the fluid as it comes out. I see\r\nWasps, Flies, Earwigs, Rose-chafers, and above all, Ants.\r\n\r\nThe smallest, in order to reach the well, slip under the body of the\r\nCicada, who good-naturedly raises himself on his legs to let them pass.\r\nThe larger insects snatch a sip, retreat, take a walk on a neighbouring\r\nbranch, and then return more eager and enterprising than before. They\r\nnow become violent brigands, determined to chase the Cicada away from\r\nhis well.\r\n\r\nThe worst offenders are the Ants. I have seen them nibbling at the ends\r\nof the Cicada’s legs, tugging at the tips of his wings, and climbing on\r\nhis back. Once a bold robber, before my very eyes, caught hold of a\r\nCicada’s sucker and tried to pull it out.\r\n\r\nAt last, worried beyond all patience, the singer deserts the well he\r\nhas made. The Ant has now attained her object: she is left in\r\npossession of the spring. This dries up very soon, it is true; but,\r\nhaving drunk all the sap that is there, she can wait for another drink\r\ntill she has a chance of stealing another well.\r\n\r\nSo you see that the actual facts are just the reverse of those in the\r\nfable. The Ant is the hardened beggar: the industrious worker is the\r\nCicada.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nTHE CICADA’S BURROW\r\n\r\nI am in an excellent position to study the habits of the Cicada, for I\r\nlive in his company. When July comes he takes possession of the\r\nenclosures right up to the threshold of the house. I remain master\r\nindoors, but out of doors he reigns supreme, and his reign is by no\r\nmeans a peaceful one.\r\n\r\nThe first Cicada appear at midsummer. In the much-trodden, sun-baked\r\npaths I see, level with the ground, round holes about the size of a\r\nman’s thumb. Through these holes the Cicada-grubs come up from the\r\nunderground to be transformed into full-grown Cicadæ on the surface.\r\nTheir favourite places are the driest and sunniest; for these grubs are\r\nprovided with such powerful tools that they can bore through baked\r\nearth or sandstone. When I examine their deserted burrows I have to use\r\nmy pickaxe.\r\n\r\nThe first thing one notices is that the holes, which measure nearly an\r\ninch across, have absolutely no rubbish round them. There is no mound\r\nof earth thrown up outside. Most of the digging insects, such as the\r\nDorbeetles for instance, make a mole-hill above their burrows. The\r\nreason for this difference lies in their manner of working. The\r\nDorbeetle begins his work at the mouth of the hole, so he can heap up\r\non the surface the material he digs out: but the Cicada-grub comes up\r\nfrom below. The last thing he does is to make the doorway, and he\r\ncannot heap rubbish on a threshold that does not yet exist.\r\n\r\nThe Cicada’s tunnel runs to a depth of fifteen or sixteen inches. It is\r\nquite open the whole way. It ends in a rather wider space, but is\r\ncompletely closed at the bottom. What has become of the earth removed\r\nto make this tunnel? And why do not the walls crumble? One would expect\r\nthat the grub, climbing up and down with his clawed legs, would make\r\nlandslips and block up his own house.\r\n\r\nWell, he behaves like a miner or a railway-engineer. The miner holds up\r\nhis galleries with pit-props; the builder of railways strengthens his\r\ntunnel with a casing of brickwork; the Cicada is as clever as either of\r\nthem, and covers the walls of his tunnel with cement. He carries a\r\nstore of sticky fluid hidden within him, with which to make this\r\nplaster. His burrow is always built above some tiny rootlet containing\r\nsap, and from this root he renews his supply of fluid.\r\n\r\nIt is very important for him to be able to run up and down his burrow\r\nat his ease, because, when the time comes for him to find his way into\r\nthe sunshine, he wants to know what the weather is like outside. So he\r\nworks away for weeks, perhaps for months, to make a funnel with good\r\nstrong plastered walls, on which he can clamber. At the top he leaves a\r\nlayer as thick as one’s finger, to protect him from the outer air till\r\nthe last moment. At the least hint of fine weather he scrambles up,\r\nand, through the thin lid at the top, inquires into the state of the\r\nweather.\r\n\r\nIf he suspects a storm or rain on the surface—matter of great\r\nimportance to a delicate grub when he takes off his skin!—he slips\r\nprudently back to the bottom of his snug funnel. But if the weather\r\nseems warm he smashes his ceiling with a few strokes of his claws, and\r\nclimbs to the surface.\r\n\r\nIt is the fluid substance carried by the Cicada-grub in his swollen\r\nbody that enables him to get rid of the rubbish in his burrow. As he\r\ndigs he sprinkles the dusty earth and turns it into paste. The walls\r\nthen become soft and yielding. The mud squeezes into the chinks of the\r\nrough soil, and the grub compresses it with his fat body. This is why,\r\nwhen he appears at the top, he is always covered with wet stains.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor some time after the Cicada-grub’s first appearance above-ground he\r\nwanders about the neighbourhood, looking for a suitable spot in which\r\nto cast off his skin—a tiny bush, a tuft of thyme, a blade of grass, or\r\nthe twig of a shrub. When he finds it he climbs up, and clings to it\r\nfirmly with the claws of his fore-feet. His fore-legs stiffen into an\r\nimmovable grip.\r\n\r\nThen his outer skin begins to split along the middle of the back,\r\nshowing the pale-green Cicada within. Presently the head is free; then\r\nthe sucker and front legs appear, and finally the hind-legs and the\r\nrumpled wings. The whole insect is free now, except the extreme tip of\r\nhis body.\r\n\r\nHe next performs a wonderful gymnastic feat. High in the air as he is,\r\nfixed to his old skin at one point only, he turns himself over till his\r\nhead is hanging downwards. His crumpled wings straighten out, unfurl,\r\nand spread themselves. Then with an almost invisible movement he draws\r\nhimself up again by sheer strength, and hooks his fore-legs on to his\r\nempty skin. This movement has released the tip of his body from its\r\nsheath. The whole operation has taken about half an hour.\r\n\r\nFor a time the freed Cicada does not feel very strong. He must bathe in\r\nair and sunshine before strength and colour come to his frail body.\r\nHanging to his cast skin by his fore-claws only, he sways at the least\r\nbreath of air, still feeble and still green. But at last the brown\r\ntinge appears, and is soon general. Supposing him to have taken\r\npossession of the twig at nine o’clock in the morning, the Cicada flies\r\naway at half-past twelve, leaving his cast skin behind him. Sometimes\r\nit hangs from the twigs for months.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nTHE CICADA’S MUSIC\r\n\r\nThe Cicada, it appears, loves singing for its own sake. Not content\r\nwith carrying an instrument called the cymbal in a cavity behind his\r\nwings, he increases its power by means of sounding-boards under his\r\nchest. Indeed, there is one kind of Cicada who sacrifices a great deal\r\nin order to give full play to his musical tastes. He carries such an\r\nenormous sounding-board that there is hardly any room left for his\r\nvital organs, which are squeezed into a tiny corner. Assuredly one must\r\nbe passionately devoted to music thus to clear away one’s internal\r\norgans in order to make room for a musical box!\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the song he loves so much is extremely unattractive to\r\nothers. Nor have I yet discovered its object. It is usually suggested\r\nthat he is calling his mate; but the facts appear to contradict this\r\nidea.\r\n\r\nFor fifteen years the Common Cicada has thrust his society upon me.\r\nEvery summer for two months I have these insects before my eyes, and\r\ntheir song in my ears. I see them ranged in rows on the smooth bark of\r\nthe plane-trees, the maker of music and his mate sitting side by side.\r\nWith their suckers driven into the tree they drink, motionless. As the\r\nsun turns they also turn round the branch with slow, sidelong steps, to\r\nfind the hottest spot. Whether drinking or moving they never cease\r\nsinging.\r\n\r\nIt seems unlikely, therefore, that they are calling their mates. You do\r\nnot spend months on end calling to some one who is at your elbow.\r\n\r\nIndeed, I am inclined to think that the Cicada himself cannot even hear\r\nthe song he sings with so much apparent delight. This might account for\r\nthe relentless way in which he forces his music upon others.\r\n\r\nHe has very clear sight. His five eyes tell him what is happening to\r\nright and to left and above his head; and the moment he sees any one\r\ncoming he is silent and flies away. Yet no noise disturbs him. Place\r\nyourself behind him, and then talk, whistle, clap your hands, and knock\r\ntwo stones together. For much less than this a bird, though he would\r\nnot see you, would fly away terrified. The imperturbable Cicada goes on\r\nrattling as though nothing were there.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion I borrowed the local artillery, that is to say the guns\r\nthat are fired on feast-days in the village. There were two of them,\r\nand they were crammed with powder as though for the most important\r\nrejoicings. They were placed at the foot of the plane-trees in front of\r\nmy door. We were careful to leave the windows open, to prevent the\r\npanes from breaking. The Cicadæ in the branches overhead could not see\r\nwhat was happening.\r\n\r\nSix of us waited below, eager to hear what would be the effect on the\r\norchestra above.\r\n\r\nBang! The gun went off with a noise like a thunderclap.\r\n\r\nQuite unconcerned, the Cicadæ continued to sing. Not one appeared in\r\nthe least disturbed. There was no change whatever in the quality or the\r\nquantity of the sound. The second gun had no more effect than the\r\nfirst.\r\n\r\nI think, after this experiment, we must admit that the Cicada is hard\r\nof hearing, and like a very deaf man, is quite unconscious that he is\r\nmaking a noise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nTHE CICADA’S EGGS\r\n\r\nThe Common Cicada likes to lay her eggs on small dry branches. She\r\nchooses, as far as possible, tiny stalks, which may be of any size\r\nbetween that of a straw and a lead-pencil. The sprig is never lying on\r\nthe ground, is usually nearly upright in position, and is almost always\r\ndead.\r\n\r\nHaving found a twig to suit her, she makes a row of pricks with the\r\nsharp instrument on her chest—such pricks as might be made with a pin\r\nif it were driven downwards on a slant, so as to tear the fibres and\r\nforce them slightly upwards. If she is undisturbed she will make thirty\r\nor forty of these pricks on the same twig.\r\n\r\nIn the tiny cells formed by these pricks she lays her eggs. The cells\r\nare narrow passages, each one slanting down towards the one below it. I\r\ngenerally find about ten eggs in each cell, so it is plain that the\r\nCicada lays between three and four hundred eggs altogether.\r\n\r\nThis is a fine family for one insect. The numbers point to some special\r\ndanger that threatens the Cicada, and makes it necessary to produce a\r\ngreat quantity of grubs lest some should be destroyed. After many\r\nobservations I have discovered what this danger is. It is an extremely\r\ntiny Gnat, compared with which the Cicada is a monster.\r\n\r\nThis Gnat, like the Cicada, carries a boring-tool. It is planted\r\nbeneath her body, near the middle, and sticks out at right angles. As\r\nfast as the Cicada lays her eggs the Gnat tries to destroy them. It is\r\na real scourge to the Cicada family. It is amazing to watch her calm\r\nand brazen audacity in the presence of the giant who could crush her by\r\nsimply stepping on her. I have seen as many as three preparing to\r\ndespoil one unhappy Cicada at the same time, standing close behind one\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nThe Cicada has just stocked a cell with eggs, and is climbing a little\r\nhigher to make another cell. One of the brigands runs to the spot she\r\nhas just left; and here, almost under the claws of the monster, as\r\ncalmly and fearlessly as though she were at home, the Gnat bores a\r\nsecond hole above the Cicada’s eggs, and places among them an egg of\r\nher own. By the time the Cicada flies away most of her cells have, in\r\nthis way, received a stranger’s egg, which will be the ruin of hers. A\r\nsmall quick-hatching grub, one only to each cell, handsomely fed on a\r\ndozen raw eggs, will take the place of the Cicada’s family.\r\n\r\nThis deplorable mother has learnt nothing from centuries of experience.\r\nHer large and excellent eyes cannot fail to see the terrible felons\r\nfluttering round her. She must know they are at her heels, and yet she\r\nremains unmoved, and lets herself be victimised. She could easily crush\r\nthe wicked atoms, but she is incapable of altering her instincts, even\r\nto save her family from destruction.\r\n\r\nThrough my magnifying-glass I have seen the hatching of the Cicada’s\r\neggs. When the grub first appears it has a marked likeness to an\r\nextremely small fish, with large black eyes, and a curious sort of mock\r\nfin under its body, formed of the two fore-legs joined together. This\r\nfin has some power of movement, and helps the grub to work its way out\r\nof the shell, and also—a much more difficult matter—out of the fibrous\r\nstem in which it is imprisoned.\r\n\r\nAs soon as this fish-like object has made its way out of the cell it\r\nsheds its skin. But the cast skin forms itself into a thread, by which\r\nthe grub remains fastened to the twig or stem. Here, before dropping to\r\nthe ground, it treats itself to a sun-bath, kicking about and trying\r\nits strength, or swinging lazily at the end of its rope.\r\n\r\nIts antennæ now are free, and wave about; its legs work their joints;\r\nthose in front open and shut their claws. I know hardly any more\r\ncurious sight than this tiny acrobat hanging by the tip of its body,\r\nswinging at the least breath of wind, and making ready in the air for\r\nits somersault into the world.\r\n\r\nSooner or later, without losing much time, it drops to the ground. The\r\nlittle creature, no bigger than a Flea, has saved its tender body from\r\nthe rough earth by swinging on its cord. It has hardened itself in the\r\nair, that luxurious eiderdown. It now plunges into the stern realities\r\nof life.\r\n\r\nI see a thousand dangers ahead of it. The merest breath of wind could\r\nblow it on to the hard rock, or into the stagnant water in some deep\r\ncart-rut, or on the sand where nothing grows, or else on a clay soil,\r\ntoo tough for it to dig in.\r\n\r\nThe feeble creature needs shelter at once, and must look for an\r\nunderground refuge. The days are growing cold, and delays are fatal to\r\nit. It must wander about in search of soft soil, and no doubt many die\r\nbefore they find it.\r\n\r\nWhen at last it discovers the right spot it attacks the earth with the\r\nhooks on its fore-feet. Through the magnifying-glass I watch it\r\nwielding its pickaxes, and raking an atom of earth to the surface. In a\r\nfew minutes a well has been scooped out. The little creature goes down\r\ninto it, buries itself, and is henceforth invisible.\r\n\r\nThe underground life of the undeveloped Cicada remains a secret. But we\r\nknow how long it remains in the earth before it comes to the surface\r\nand becomes a full-grown Cicada. For four years it lives below the\r\nsoil. Then for about five weeks it sings in the sunshine.\r\n\r\nFour years of hard work in the darkness, and a month of delight in the\r\nsun—such is the Cicada’s life. We must not blame him for the noisy\r\ntriumph of his song. For four years he has dug the earth with his feet,\r\nand then suddenly he is dressed in exquisite raiment, provided with\r\nwings that rival the bird’s, and bathed in heat and light! What cymbals\r\ncan be loud enough to celebrate his happiness, so hardly earned, and so\r\nvery, very short?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE PRAYING MANTIS\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nHER HUNTING\r\n\r\nThere is an insect of the south that is quite as interesting as the\r\nCicada, but much less famous, because it makes no noise. Had it been\r\nprovided with cymbals, its renown would have been greater than the\r\ncelebrated musician’s, for it is most unusual both in shape and habits.\r\n\r\nA long time ago, in the days of ancient Greece, this insect was named\r\nMantis, or the Prophet. The peasant saw her on the sun-scorched grass,\r\nstanding half-erect in a very imposing and majestic manner, with her\r\nbroad green gossamer wings trailing like long veils, and her fore-legs,\r\nlike arms, raised to the sky as though in prayer. To the peasant’s\r\nignorance the insect seemed like a priestess or a nun, and so she came\r\nto be called the Praying Mantis.\r\n\r\nThere was never a greater mistake! Those pious airs are a fraud; those\r\narms raised in prayer are really the most horrible weapons, which slay\r\nwhatever passes within reach. The Mantis is fierce as a tigress, cruel\r\nas an ogress. She feeds only on living creatures.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing in her appearance to inspire dread. She is not without\r\na certain beauty, with her slender, graceful figure, her pale-green\r\ncolouring, and her long gauze wings. Having a flexible neck, she can\r\nmove her head freely in all directions. She is the only insect that can\r\ndirect her gaze wherever she will. She almost has a face.\r\n\r\nGreat is the contrast between this peaceful-looking body and the\r\nmurderous machinery of the fore-legs. The haunch is very long and\r\npowerful, while the thigh is even longer, and carries on its lower\r\nsurface two rows of sharp spikes or teeth. Behind these teeth are three\r\nspurs. In short, the thigh is a saw with two blades, between which the\r\nleg lies when folded back.\r\n\r\nThis leg itself is also a double-edged saw, provided with a greater\r\nnumber of teeth than the thigh. It ends in a strong hook with a point\r\nas sharp as a needle, and a double blade like a curved pruning-knife. I\r\nhave many painful memories of this hook. Many a time, when\r\nMantis-hunting, I have been clawed by the insect and forced to ask\r\nsomebody else to release me. No insect in this part of the world is so\r\ntroublesome to handle. The Mantis claws you with her pruning-hooks,\r\npricks you with her spikes, seizes you in her vice, and makes\r\nself-defence impossible if you wish to keep your captive alive.\r\n\r\nWhen at rest, the trap is folded back against the chest and looks quite\r\nharmless. There you have the insect praying. But if a victim passes by,\r\nthe appearance of prayer is quickly dropped. The three long divisions\r\nof the trap are suddenly unfolded, and the prey is caught with the\r\nsharp hook at the end of them, and drawn back between the two saws.\r\nThen the vice closes, and all is over. Locusts, Grasshoppers, and even\r\nstronger insects are helpless against the four rows of teeth.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to make a complete study of the habits of the Mantis\r\nin the open fields, so I am obliged to take her indoors. She can live\r\nquite happily in a pan filled with sand and covered with a gauze\r\ndish-cover, if only she be supplied with plenty of fresh food. In order\r\nto find out what can be done by the strength and daring of the Mantis,\r\nI provide her not only with Locusts and Grasshoppers, but also with the\r\nlargest Spiders of the neighbourhood. This is what I see.\r\n\r\nA grey Locust, heedless of danger, walks towards the Mantis. The latter\r\ngives a convulsive shiver, and suddenly, in the most surprising way,\r\nstrikes an attitude that fills the Locust with terror, and is quite\r\nenough to startle any one. You see before you unexpectedly a sort of\r\nbogy-man or Jack-in-the-box. The wing-covers open; the wings spread to\r\ntheir full extent and stand erect like sails, towering over the\r\ninsect’s back; the tip of the body curls up like a crook, rising and\r\nfalling with short jerks, and making a sound like the puffing of a\r\nstartled Adder. Planted defiantly on its four hind-legs, the Mantis\r\nholds the front part of its body almost upright. The murderous legs\r\nopen wide, and show a pattern of black-and-white spots beneath them.\r\n\r\nIn this strange attitude the Mantis stands motionless, with eyes fixed\r\non her prey. If the Locust moves, the Mantis turns her head. The object\r\nof this performance is plain. It is intended to strike terror into the\r\nheart of the victim, to paralyse it with fright before attacking it.\r\nThe Mantis is pretending to be a ghost!\r\n\r\nThe plan is quite successful. The Locust sees a spectre before him, and\r\ngazes at it without moving. He to whom leaping is so easy makes no\r\nattempt at escape. He stays stupidly where he is, or even draws nearer\r\nwith a leisurely step.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he is within reach of the Mantis she strikes with her claws;\r\nher double saws close and clutch; the poor wretch protests in vain; the\r\ncruel ogress begins her meal.\r\n\r\nThe pretty Crab Spider stabs her victim in the neck, in order to poison\r\nit and make it helpless. In the same way the Mantis attacks the Locust\r\nfirst at the back of the neck, to destroy its power of movement. This\r\nenables her to kill and eat an insect as big as herself, or even\r\nbigger. It is amazing that the greedy creature can contain so much\r\nfood.\r\n\r\nThe various Digger-wasps receive visits from her pretty frequently.\r\nPosted near the burrows on a bramble, she waits for chance to bring\r\nnear her a double prize, the Hunting-wasp and the prey she is bringing\r\nhome. For a long time she waits in vain; for the Wasp is suspicious and\r\non her guard: still, now and then a rash one is caught. With a sudden\r\nrustle of wings the Mantis terrifies the new-comer, who hesitates for a\r\nmoment in her fright. Then, with the sharpness of a spring, the Wasp is\r\nfixed as in a trap between the blades of the double saw—the toothed\r\nfore-arm and toothed upper-arm of the Mantis. The victim is then gnawed\r\nin small mouthfuls.\r\n\r\nI once saw a Bee-eating Wasp, while carrying a Bee to her storehouse,\r\nattacked and caught by a Mantis. The Wasp was in the act of eating the\r\nhoney she had found in the Bee’s crop. The double saw of the Mantis\r\nclosed suddenly on the feasting Wasp; but neither terror nor torture\r\ncould persuade that greedy creature to leave off eating. Even while she\r\nwas herself being actually devoured she continued to lick the honey\r\nfrom her Bee!\r\n\r\nI regret to say that the meals of this savage ogress are not confined\r\nto other kinds of insects. For all her sanctimonious airs she is a\r\ncannibal. She will eat her sister as calmly as though she were a\r\nGrasshopper; and those around her will make no protest, being quite\r\nready to do the same on the first opportunity. Indeed, she even makes a\r\nhabit of devouring her mate, whom she seizes by the neck and then\r\nswallows by little mouthfuls, leaving only the wings.\r\n\r\nShe is worse than the Wolf; for it is said that even Wolves never eat\r\neach other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nHER NEST\r\n\r\nAfter all, however, the Mantis has her good points, like most people.\r\nShe makes a most marvellous nest.\r\n\r\nThis nest is to be found more or less everywhere in sunny places: on\r\nstones, wood, vine-stocks, twigs, or dry grass, and even on such things\r\nas bits of brick, strips of linen, or the shrivelled leather of an old\r\nboot. Any support will serve, as long as there is an uneven surface to\r\nform a solid foundation.\r\n\r\nIn size the nest is between one and two inches long, and less than an\r\ninch wide; and its colour is as golden as a grain of wheat. It is made\r\nof a frothy substance, which has become solid and hard, and it smells\r\nlike silk when it is burnt. The shape of it varies according to the\r\nsupport on which it is based, but in all cases the upper surface is\r\nconvex. One can distinguish three bands, or zones, of which the middle\r\none is made of little plates or scales, arranged in pairs and\r\noverlapping like the tiles of a roof. The edges of these plates are\r\nfree, forming two rows of slits or little doorways, through which the\r\nyoung Mantis escapes at the moment of hatching. In every other part the\r\nwall of the nest is impenetrable.\r\n\r\nThe eggs are arranged in layers, with the ends containing the heads\r\npointed towards the doorways. Of these doorways, as I have just said,\r\nthere are two rows. One half of the grubs will go out through the right\r\ndoor, and the other half through the left.\r\n\r\nIt is a remarkable fact that the mother Mantis builds this\r\ncleverly-made nest while she is actually laying her eggs. From her body\r\nshe produces a sticky substance, rather like the Caterpillar’s\r\nsilk-fluid; and this material she mixes with the air and whips into\r\nfroth. She beats it into foam with two ladles that she has at the tip\r\nof her body, just as we beat white of egg with a fork. The foam is\r\ngreyish-white, almost like soapsuds, and when it first appears it is\r\nsticky; but two minutes afterwards it has solidified.\r\n\r\nIn this sea of foam the Mantis deposits her eggs. As each layer of eggs\r\nis laid, it is covered with froth, which quickly becomes solid.\r\n\r\nIn a new nest the belt of exit-doors is coated with a material that\r\nseems different from the rest—a layer of fine porous matter, of a pure,\r\ndull, almost chalky white, which contrasts with the dirty white of the\r\nremainder of the nest. It is like the mixture that confectioners make\r\nof whipped white of egg, sugar, and starch, with which to ornament\r\ntheir cakes. This snowy covering is very easily crumbled and removed.\r\nWhen it is gone the exit-belt is clearly visible, with its two rows of\r\nplates. The wind and rain sooner or later remove it in strips or\r\nflakes, and therefore the old nests show no traces of it.\r\n\r\nBut these two materials, though they appear different, are really only\r\ntwo forms of the same matter. The Mantis with her ladles sweeps the\r\nsurface of the foam, skimming the top of the froth, and collecting it\r\ninto a band along the back of the nest. The ribbon that looks like\r\nsugar-icing is merely the thinnest and lightest portion of the sticky\r\nspray, which appears whiter than the nest because its bubbles are more\r\ndelicate, and reflect more light.\r\n\r\nIt is truly a wonderful piece of machinery that can, so methodically\r\nand swiftly, produce the horny central substance on which the first\r\neggs are laid, the eggs themselves, the protecting froth, the soft\r\nsugar-like covering of the doorways, and at the same time can build\r\noverlapping plates, and the narrow passages leading to them! Yet the\r\nMantis, while she is doing all this, hangs motionless on the foundation\r\nof the nest. She gives not a glance at the building that is rising\r\nbehind her. Her legs act no part in the affair. The machinery works by\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nAs soon as she has done her work the mother withdraws. I expected to\r\nsee her return and show some tender feeling for the cradle of her\r\nfamily, but it evidently has no further interest for her.\r\n\r\nThe Mantis, I fear, has no heart. She eats her husband, and deserts her\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nTHE HATCHING OF HER EGGS\r\n\r\nThe eggs of the Mantis usually hatch in bright sunshine, at about ten\r\no’clock on a mid-June morning.\r\n\r\nAs I have already told you, there is only one part of the nest from\r\nwhich the grub can find an outlet, namely the band of scales round the\r\nmiddle. From under each of these scales one sees slowly appearing a\r\nblunt, transparent lump, followed by two large black specks, which are\r\nthe creature’s eyes. The baby grub slips gently under the thin plate\r\nand half releases itself. It is reddish yellow, and has a thick,\r\nswollen head. Under its outer skin it is quite easy to distinguish the\r\nlarge black eyes, the mouth flattened against the chest, the legs\r\nplastered to the body from front to back. With the exception of these\r\nlegs the whole thing reminds one somewhat of the first state of the\r\nCicada on leaving the egg.\r\n\r\nLike the Cicada, the young Mantis finds it necessary to wear an overall\r\nwhen it is coming into the world, for the sake of convenience and\r\nsafety. It has to emerge from the depths of the nest through narrow,\r\nwinding ways, in which full-spread slender limbs could not find enough\r\nroom. The tall stilts, the murderous harpoons, the delicate antennæ,\r\nwould hinder its passage, and indeed make it impossible. The creature\r\ntherefore appears in swaddling-clothes, and has the shape of a boat.\r\n\r\nWhen the grub peeps out under the thin scales of its nest its head\r\nbecomes bigger and bigger, till it looks like a throbbing blister. The\r\nlittle creature alternately pushes forward and draws back, in its\r\nefforts to free itself, and at each movement the head grows larger. At\r\nlast the outer skin bursts at the upper part of the chest, and the grub\r\nwriggles and tugs and bends about, determined to throw off its overall.\r\nFinally the legs and the long antennæ are freed, and a few shakes\r\ncomplete the operation.\r\n\r\nIt is a striking sight to see a hundred young Mantes coming from the\r\nnest at once. Hardly does one tiny creature show its black eyes under a\r\nscale before a swarm of others appears. It is as though a signal passed\r\nfrom one to the other, so swiftly does the hatching spread. Almost in a\r\nmoment the middle zone of the nest is covered with grubs, who run about\r\nfeverishly, stripping themselves of their torn garments. Then they drop\r\noff, or clamber into the nearest foliage. A few days later a fresh\r\nswarm appears, and so on till all the eggs are hatched.\r\n\r\nBut alas! the poor grubs are hatched into a world of dangers. I have\r\nseen them hatching many times, both out of doors in my enclosure, and\r\nin the seclusion of a greenhouse, where I hoped I should be better able\r\nto protect them. Twenty times at least I have watched the scene, and\r\nevery time the slaughter of the grubs has been terrible. The Mantis\r\nlays many eggs, but she will never lay enough to cope with the hungry\r\nmurderers who lie in wait until the grubs appear.\r\n\r\nThe Ants, above all, are their enemies. Every day I find them visiting\r\nmy nests. It is in vain for me to interfere; they always get the better\r\nof me. They seldom succeed in entering the nest; its hard walls form\r\ntoo strong a fortress. But they wait outside for their prey.\r\n\r\nThe moment that the young grubs appear they are grabbed by the Ants,\r\npulled out of their sheaths, and cut in pieces. You see piteous\r\nstruggles between the little creatures who can only protest with wild\r\nwrigglings and the ferocious brigands who are carrying them off. In a\r\nmoment the massacre is over; all that is left of the flourishing family\r\nis a few scattered survivors who have escaped by accident.\r\n\r\nIt is curious that the Mantis, the scourge of the insect race, should\r\nbe herself so often devoured at this early stage of her life, by one of\r\nthe least of that race, the Ant. The ogress sees her family eaten by\r\nthe dwarf. But this does not continue long. So soon as she has become\r\nfirm and strong from contact with the air the Mantis can hold her own.\r\nShe trots about briskly among the Ants, who fall back as she passes, no\r\nlonger daring to tackle her: with her fore-legs brought close to her\r\nchest, like arms ready for self-defence, she already strikes awe into\r\nthem by her proud bearing.\r\n\r\nBut the Mantis has another enemy who is less easily dismayed. The\r\nlittle Grey Lizard, the lover of sunny walls, pays small heed to\r\nthreatening attitudes. With the tip of his slender tongue he picks up,\r\none by one, the few stray insects that have escaped the Ant. They make\r\nbut a small mouthful, but to judge from the Lizard’s expression they\r\ntaste very good. Every time he gulps down one of the little creatures\r\nhe half-closes his eyelids, a sign of profound satisfaction.\r\n\r\nMoreover, even before the hatching the eggs are in danger. There is a\r\ntiny insect called the Chalcis, who carries a probe sharp enough to\r\npenetrate the nest of solidified foam. So the brood of the Mantis\r\nshares the fate of the Cicada’s. The eggs of a stranger are laid in the\r\nnest, and are hatched before those of the rightful owner. The owner’s\r\neggs are then eaten by the invaders. The Mantis lays, perhaps, a\r\nthousand eggs. Possibly only one couple of these escapes destruction.\r\n\r\nThe Mantis eats the Locust: the Ant eats the Mantis: the Wryneck eats\r\nthe Ant. And in the autumn, when the Wryneck has grown fat from eating\r\nmany Ants, I eat the Wryneck.\r\n\r\nIt may well be that the Mantis, the Locust, the Ant, and even lesser\r\ncreatures contribute to the strength of the human brain. In strange and\r\nunseen ways they have all supplied a drop of oil to feed the lamp of\r\nthought. Their energies, slowly developed, stored up, and handed on to\r\nus, pass into our veins and sustain our weakness. We live by their\r\ndeath. The world is an endless circle. Everything finishes so that\r\neverything may begin again; everything dies so that everything may\r\nlive.\r\n\r\nIn many ages the Mantis has been regarded with superstitious awe. In\r\nProvence its nest is held to be the best remedy for chilblains. You cut\r\nthe thing in two, squeeze it, and rub the afflicted part with the juice\r\nthat streams out of it. The peasants declare that it works like a\r\ncharm. I have never felt any relief from it myself.\r\n\r\nFurther, it is highly praised as a wonderful cure for toothache. As\r\nlong as you have it on you, you need never fear that trouble. Our\r\nhousewives gather it under a favourable moon; they keep it carefully in\r\nthe corner of a cupboard, or sew it into their pocket. The neighbours\r\nborrow it when tortured by a tooth. They call it a tigno.\r\n\r\n“Lend me your tigno; I am in agony,” says the sufferer with the swollen\r\nface.\r\n\r\nThe other hastens to unstitch and hand over the precious thing.\r\n\r\n“Don’t lose it, whatever you do,” she says earnestly to her friend.\r\n“It’s the only one I have, and this isn’t the right time of moon.”\r\n\r\nThis simplicity of our peasants is surpassed by an English physician\r\nand man of science who lived in the sixteenth century. He tells us\r\nthat, in those days, if a child lost his way in the country, he would\r\nask the Mantis to put him on his road. “The Mantis,” adds the author,\r\n“will stretch out one of her feet and shew him the right way and\r\nseldome or never misse.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE GLOW-WORM\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nHIS SURGICAL INSTRUMENT\r\n\r\nFew insects enjoy more fame than the Glow-worm, the curious little\r\nanimal who celebrates the joy of life by lighting a lantern at its\r\ntail-end. We all know it, at least by name, even if we have not seen it\r\nroaming through the grass, like a spark fallen from the full moon. The\r\nGreeks of old called it the Bright-tailed, and modern science gives it\r\nthe name Lampyris.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact the Lampyris is not a worm at all, not even in\r\ngeneral appearance. He has six short legs, which he well knows how to\r\nuse, for he is a real gad-about. The male, when he is full-grown has\r\nwing-cases, like the true Beetle that he is. The female is an\r\nunattractive creature who knows nothing of the delights of flying and\r\nall her life remains in the larva, or incomplete form. Even at this\r\nstage the word “worm” is out of place. We French use the phrase “naked\r\nas a worm” to express the lack of any kind of protection. Now the\r\nLampyris is clothed, that is to say he wears an outer skin that serves\r\nas a defence; and he is, moreover, rather richly coloured. He is dark\r\nbrown, with pale pink on the chest; and each segment, or division, of\r\nhis body is ornamented at the edge with two spots of fairly bright red.\r\nA costume like this was never worn by a worm!\r\n\r\nNevertheless we will continue to call him the Glow-worm, since it is by\r\nthat name that he is best known to the world.\r\n\r\nThe two most interesting peculiarities about the Glow-worm are, first,\r\nthe way he secures his food, and secondly, the lantern at his tail.\r\n\r\nA famous Frenchman, a master of the science of food, once said:\r\n\r\n“Show me what you eat, and I will tell you what you are.”\r\n\r\nA similar question should be addressed to every insect whose habits we\r\npropose to study; for the information supplied by food is the chief of\r\nall the documents of animal life. Well, in spite of his innocent\r\nappearance, the Glow-worm is an eater of flesh, a hunter of game; and\r\nhe carries on his hunting with rare villainy. His regular prey is the\r\nSnail. This fact has long been known; but what is not so well known is\r\nhis curious method of attack, of which I have seen no other example\r\nanywhere.\r\n\r\nBefore he begins to feed on his victim he gives it an anæsthetic—he\r\nmakes it unconscious, as a person is made unconscious with chloroform\r\nbefore a surgical operation. His food, as a rule, is a certain small\r\nSnail hardly the size of a cherry, which collects in clusters during\r\nthe hot weather, on the stiff stubble and other dry stalks by the\r\nroadside, and there remains motionless, in profound meditation,\r\nthroughout the scorching summer days. In some such place as this I have\r\noften seen the Glow-worm feasting on his unconscious prey, which he had\r\njust paralysed on its shaky support.\r\n\r\nBut he frequents other places too. At the edge of cool, damp ditches,\r\nwhere the vegetation is varied, many Snails are to be found; and in\r\nsuch spots as these the Glow-worm can kill his victim on the ground. I\r\ncan reproduce these conditions at home, and can there follow the\r\noperator’s performance down to the smallest detail.\r\n\r\nI will try to describe the strange sight. I place a little grass in a\r\nwide glass jar. In this I install a few Glow-worms and a supply of\r\nSnails of a suitable size, neither too large nor too small. One must be\r\npatient and wait, and above all keep a careful watch, for the events\r\ntake place unexpectedly and do not last long.\r\n\r\nFor a moment the Glow-worm examines his prey, which, according to its\r\nhabit, is completely hidden in the shell, except for the edge of the\r\n“mantle,” which projects slightly. Then the hunter draws his weapon. It\r\nis a very simple weapon, but it cannot be seen without a\r\nmagnifying-glass. It consists of two mandibles, bent back into a hook,\r\nvery sharp and as thin as a hair. Through the microscope one can see a\r\nslender groove running down the hook. And that is all.\r\n\r\nThe insect repeatedly taps the Snail’s mantle with its instrument. It\r\nall happens with such gentleness as to suggest kisses rather than\r\nbites. As children, teasing one another, we used to talk of “tweaks” to\r\nexpress a slight squeeze of the finger-tips, something more like\r\ntickling than a serious pinch. Let us use that word. In conversation\r\nwith animals, language loses nothing by remaining simple. The Glow-worm\r\ngives tweaks to the Snail.\r\n\r\nHe doles them out methodically, without hurrying, and takes a brief\r\nrest after each of them, as though to find out what effect has been\r\nproduced. The number of tweaks is not great: half a dozen at most,\r\nwhich are enough to make the Snail motionless, and to rob him of all\r\nfeeling. That other pinches are administered later, at the time of\r\neating, seems very likely, but I cannot say anything for certain on\r\nthat subject. The first few, however—there are never many—are enough to\r\nprevent the Snail from feeling anything, thanks to the promptitude of\r\nthe Glow-worm, who, at lightning speed, darts some kind of poison into\r\nhis victim by means of his grooved hooks.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt at all that the Snail is made insensible to pain. If,\r\nwhen the Glow-worm has dealt some four or five of his twitches, I take\r\naway the victim and prick it with a fine needle, there is not a quiver\r\nin the wounded flesh, there is not the smallest sign of life. Moreover,\r\nI occasionally chance to see Snails attacked by the Lampyris while they\r\nare creeping along the ground, the foot slowly crawling, the tentacles\r\nswollen to their full extent. A few disordered movements betray a brief\r\nexcitement on the part of the Snail, and then everything ceases: the\r\nfoot no longer crawls, the front-part loses its graceful curve, the\r\ntentacles become limp and give way under their own weight, dangling\r\nfeebly like a broken stick. The Snail, to all appearance, is dead.\r\n\r\nHe is not, however, really dead. I can bring him to life again. When he\r\nhas been for two or three days in a condition that is neither life nor\r\ndeath I give him a shower-bath. In about a couple of days my prisoner,\r\nso lately injured by the Glow-worm’s treachery, is restored to his\r\nusual state. He revives, he recovers movement and sensibility. He is\r\naffected by the touch of a needle; he shifts his place, crawls, puts\r\nout his tentacles, as though nothing unusual had occurred. The general\r\ntorpor, a sort of deep drunkenness, has vanished outright. The dead\r\nreturns to life.\r\n\r\nHuman science did not invent the art of making a person insensible to\r\npain, which is one of the triumphs of surgery. Far back in the\r\ncenturies the Glow-worm, and apparently others too, was practising it.\r\nThe surgeon makes us breathe the fumes of ether or chloroform: the\r\ninsect darts forth from his fangs very tiny doses of a special poison.\r\n\r\nWhen we consider the harmless and peaceful nature of the Snail it seems\r\ncurious that the Glow-worm should require this remarkable talent. But I\r\nthink I know the reason.\r\n\r\nWhen the Snail is on the ground, creeping, or even shrunk into his\r\nshell, the attack never presents any difficulty. The shell possesses no\r\nlid and leaves the hermit’s fore-part to a great extent exposed. But it\r\nvery often happens that he is in a raised position, clinging to the tip\r\nof a grass-stalk, or perhaps to the smooth surface of a stone. This\r\nsupport to which he fastens himself serves very well as a protection;\r\nit acts as a lid, supposing that the shell fits closely on the stone or\r\nstalk. But if the least bit of the Snail be left uncovered the slender\r\nhooks of the Glow-worm can find their way in through the gap, and in a\r\nmoment the victim is made unconscious, and can be eaten in comfort.\r\n\r\nNow, a Snail perched on top of a stalk is very easily upset. The\r\nslightest struggle, the most feeble wriggle on his part, would dislodge\r\nhim; he would fall to the ground, and the Glow-worm would be left\r\nwithout food. It is necessary for the Snail to be made instantly\r\nunconscious of pain, or he would escape; and it must be done with a\r\ntouch so delicate that it does not shake him from his stalk. And that,\r\nI think, is why the Glow-worm possesses his strange surgical\r\ninstrument.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nHIS ROSETTE\r\n\r\nThe Glow-worm not only makes his victim insensible while he is poised\r\non the side of a dry grass-stalk, but he eats him in the same dangerous\r\nposition. And his preparations for his meal are by no means simple.\r\n\r\nWhat is his manner of consuming it? Does he really eat, that is to say,\r\ndoes he divide his food into pieces, does he carve it into minute\r\nparticles, which are afterwards ground by a chewing-apparatus? I think\r\nnot. I never see a trace of solid nourishment on my captives’ mouths.\r\nThe Glow-worm does not eat in the strict sense of the word; he merely\r\ndrinks. He feeds on a thin gruel, into which he transforms his prey.\r\nLike the flesh-eating grub of the Fly, he can digest his food before he\r\nswallows it; he turns his prey into liquid before feeding on it.\r\n\r\nThis is how things happen. A Snail has been made insensible by a\r\nGlow-worm, who is nearly always alone, even when the prize is a large\r\none like the Common Snail. Soon a number of guests hasten up—two,\r\nthree, or more—and, without any quarrel with the real owner, all alike\r\nfall to. A couple of days later, if I turn the shell so that the\r\nopening is downwards, the contents flow out like soup from a saucepan.\r\nBy the time the meal is finished only insignificant remains are left.\r\n\r\nThe matter is obvious. By repeated tiny bites, similar to the tweaks\r\nwhich we saw administered at the beginning, the flesh of the Snail is\r\nconverted into a gruel on which the various guests nourish themselves\r\neach in his own way, each working at the broth by means of some special\r\npepsine (or digestive fluid), and each taking his own mouthfuls of it.\r\nThe use of this method shows that the Glow-worm’s mouth must be very\r\nfeebly armed, apart from the two fangs which sting the patient and\r\ninject the poison. No doubt these fangs at the same time inject some\r\nother substance which turns the solid flesh into liquid, in such a\r\nthorough way that every morsel is turned to account.\r\n\r\nAnd this is done with exquisite delicacy, though sometimes in a\r\nposition that is anything but steady. The Snails imprisoned in my\r\napparatus sometimes crawl up to the top, which is closed with a glass\r\npane. To this pane they fix themselves with a speck of the sticky\r\nsubstance they carry with them; but, as they are miserly in their use\r\nof this substance, the merest shake is enough to loosen the shell and\r\nsend it to the bottom of the jar.\r\n\r\nNow it is not unusual for the Glow-worm to hoist himself to the top,\r\nwith the help of a certain climbing-organ that makes up for the\r\nweakness of his legs. He selects his prey, makes a careful inspection\r\nof it to find a slit, nibbles it a little, makes it insensible, and\r\nthen, without delay, proceeds to prepare the gruel which he will go on\r\neating for days on end.\r\n\r\nWhen he has finished his meal the shell is found to be absolutely\r\nempty. And yet this shell, which was fixed to the glass only by the\r\nslight smear of stickiness, has not come loose, nor even shifted its\r\nposition in the smallest degree. Without any protest from the hermit\r\nwho has been gradually converted into broth, it has been drained dry on\r\nthe very spot at which the first attack was made. These small details\r\nshow us how promptly the anæsthetic bite takes effect, and how very\r\nskilfully the Glow-worm treats his Snail.\r\n\r\nTo do all this, poised high in air on a sheet of glass or a grass-stem,\r\nthe Glow-worm must have some special limb or organ to keep him from\r\nslipping. It is plain that his short clumsy legs are not enough.\r\n\r\nThrough the magnifying-glass we can see that he does indeed possess a\r\nspecial organ of this kind. Beneath his body, towards the tail, there\r\nis a white spot. The glass shows that this is composed of about a dozen\r\nshort, fleshy little tubes, or stumpy fingers, which are sometimes\r\ngathered into a cluster, sometimes spread into a rosette. This bunch of\r\nlittle fingers helps the Glow-worm to stick to a smooth surface, and\r\nalso to climb. If he wishes to fix himself to a pane of glass or a\r\nstalk he opens his rosette, and spreads it wide on the support, to\r\nwhich it clings by its own natural stickiness. And by opening and\r\nshutting alternately it helps him to creep along and to climb.\r\n\r\nThe little fingers that form this rosette are not jointed, but are able\r\nto move in all directions. Indeed they are more like tubes than\r\nfingers, for they cannot seize anything, they can only hold on by their\r\nstickiness. They are very useful, however, for they have a third\r\npurpose, besides their powers of clinging and climbing. They are used\r\nas a sponge and brush. At a moment of rest, after a meal, the Glow-worm\r\npasses and repasses this brush over his head and sides and his whole\r\nbody, a performance made possible by the flexibility of his spine. This\r\nis done point by point, from one end of the body to the other, with a\r\nscrupulous care that proves the great interest he takes in the\r\noperation. At first one may wonder why he should dust and polish\r\nhimself so carefully. But no doubt, by the time he has turned the Snail\r\ninto gruel inside the shell and has then spent several days in eating\r\nthe result of his labours, a wash and brush-up is not amiss.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nHIS LAMP\r\n\r\nIf the Glow-worm possessed no other talent than that of chloroforming\r\nhis prey by means of a few tweaks as gentle as kisses, he would be\r\nunknown to the world in general. But he also knows how to light himself\r\nlike a lantern. He shines; which is an excellent manner of becoming\r\nfamous.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the female Glow-worm the lighting-apparatus occupies the\r\nlast three divisions of the body. On each of the first two it takes the\r\nform, on the under surface, of a wide belt of light; on the third\r\ndivision or segment the bright part is much smaller, and consists only\r\nof two spots, which shine through the back, and are visible both above\r\nand below the animal. From these belts and spots there comes a glorious\r\nwhite light, delicately tinged with blue.\r\n\r\nThe male Glow-worm carries only the smaller of these lamps, the two\r\nspots on the end segment, which are possessed by the entire tribe.\r\nThese luminous spots appear upon the young grub, and continue\r\nthroughout life unchanged. And they are always visible both on the\r\nupper and lower surface, whereas the two large belts peculiar to the\r\nfemale shine only below the body.\r\n\r\nI have examined the shining belt under the microscope. On the skin a\r\nsort of whitewash is spread, formed of some very fine grain-like\r\nsubstance, which is the source of the light. Close beside it is a\r\ncurious air-tube, with a short wide stem leading to a kind of bushy\r\ntuft of delicate branches. These branches spread over the sheet of\r\nshining matter, and sometimes dip into it.\r\n\r\nIt is plain to me that the brightness is produced by the\r\nbreathing-organs of the Glow-worm. There are certain substances which,\r\nwhen mixed with air, become luminous or even burst into flame. Such\r\nsubstances are called combustible, and the act of their producing light\r\nor flame by mingling with the air is called oxidisation. The lamp of\r\nthe Glow-worm is the result of oxidisation. The substance that looks\r\nlike whitewash is the matter that is oxidised, and the air is supplied\r\nby the tube connected with the Glow-worm’s breathing-organs. But as to\r\nthe nature of the shining substance, no one as yet knows anything.\r\n\r\nWe are better informed as regards another question. We know that the\r\nGlow-worm has complete control of the light he carries. He can turn it\r\nup or down, or out, as he pleases.\r\n\r\nIf the flow of air through the tube be increased, the light becomes\r\nmore intense: if the same air-tube, influenced by the will of the\r\nanimal, stops the passage of air, the light grows fainter or even goes\r\nout.\r\n\r\nExcitement produces an effect upon the air-tube. I am speaking now of\r\nthe modest fairy-lamp, the spots on the last segment of the Glow-worm’s\r\nbody. These are suddenly and almost completely put out by any kind of\r\nflurry. When I am hunting for young Glow-worms I can plainly see them\r\nglimmering on the blades of grass; but should the least false step\r\ndisturb a neighbouring twig, the light goes out at once and the insect\r\nbecomes invisible.\r\n\r\nThe gorgeous belts of the females, however, are very little, if at all,\r\naffected by even the most violent surprise. I fire a gun, for instance,\r\nbeside a wire-gauze cage in which I am rearing a menagerie of female\r\nGlow-worms in the open air. The explosion produces no result: the\r\nillumination continues, as bright and placid as before. I take a spray,\r\nand rain down a slight shower of cold water upon the flock. Not one of\r\nmy animals puts out its light; at the very most there is a brief pause\r\nin the radiance, and then only in some cases. I send a puff of smoke\r\nfrom my pipe into the cage. This time the pause is more marked. There\r\nare even some lamps put out, but they are soon relit. Calm returns, and\r\nthe light is as bright as ever. I take some of the captives in my\r\nfingers and tease them a little. Yet the illumination is not much\r\ndimmed, if I do not press too hard with my thumb. Nothing short of very\r\nserious reasons would make the insect put out its signals altogether.\r\n\r\nAll things considered, there is not a doubt but that the Glow-worm\r\nhimself manages his lighting-apparatus, extinguishing and rekindling it\r\nat will; but there is one circumstance over which the insect has no\r\ncontrol. If I cut off a strip of the skin, showing one of the luminous\r\nbelts, and place it in a glass tube, it will shine away merrily, though\r\nnot quite as brilliantly as on the living body. The presence of life is\r\nunnecessary, because the luminous skin is in direct contact with the\r\nair, and the flow of oxygen through the air-tube is therefore not\r\nrequired. In aerated water the skin shines as brightly as in the free\r\nair, but the light is extinguished in water that has been deprived of\r\nits air by boiling. There could be no better proof that the Glow-worm’s\r\nlight is the effect of oxidisation.\r\n\r\nThe light is white, calm, and soft to the eyes, and suggests a spark\r\ndropped by the full moon. In spite of its splendour it is very feeble.\r\nIf we move a Glow-worm along a line of print, in perfect darkness, we\r\ncan easily make out the letters one by one, and even words when they\r\nare not too long; but nothing is visible beyond this very narrow zone.\r\nA lantern of this kind soon tires the reader’s patience.\r\n\r\nThese brilliant creatures know nothing at all of family affection. They\r\nlay their eggs anywhere, or rather strew them at random, either on the\r\nearth or on a blade of grass. Then they pay no further attention to\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nFrom start to finish the Glow-worm shines. Even the eggs are luminous,\r\nand so are the grubs. At the approach of cold weather the latter go\r\ndown into the ground, but not very far. If I dig them up I find them\r\nwith their little stern-lights still shining. Even below the soil they\r\nkeep their lanterns bravely alight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nA MASON-WASP\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nHER CHOICE OF A BUILDING-SITE\r\n\r\nOf the various insects that like to make their home in our houses,\r\ncertainly the most interesting, for her beautiful shape, her curious\r\nmanners, and her wonderful nest, is a certain Wasp called the Pelopæus.\r\nShe is very little known, even to the people by whose fireside she\r\nlives. This is owing to her quiet, peaceful ways; she is so very\r\nretiring that her host is nearly always ignorant of her presence. It is\r\neasy for noisy, tiresome, unpleasant persons to make themselves famous.\r\nI will try to rescue this modest creature from her obscurity.\r\n\r\nThe Pelopæus is an extremely chilly mortal. She pitches her tent under\r\nthe kindly sun that ripens the olive and prompts the Cicada’s song; and\r\neven then she needs for her family the additional warmth to be found in\r\nour dwellings. Her usual refuge is the peasant’s lonely cottage, with\r\nits old fig-tree shading the well in front of the door. She chooses one\r\nexposed to all the heat of summers, and if possible possessing a big\r\nfireplace in which a fire of sticks always burns. The cheerful blaze on\r\nwinter evenings has a great influence upon her choice, for she knows by\r\nthe blackness of the chimney that the spot is a likely one. A chimney\r\nthat is not well glazed by smoke gives her no confidence: people must\r\nshiver with cold in that house.\r\n\r\nDuring the dog-days in July and August the visitor suddenly appears,\r\nseeking a place for her nest. She is not in the least disturbed by the\r\nbustle and movement of the household: they take no notice of her nor\r\nshe of them. She examines—now with her sharp eyes, now with her\r\nsensitive antennæ—the corners of the blackened ceiling, the rafters,\r\nthe chimney-piece, the sides of the fireplace especially, and even the\r\ninside of the flue. Having finished her inspection and duly approved of\r\nthe site she flies away, soon to return with the pellet of mud which\r\nwill form the first layer of the building.\r\n\r\nThe spot she chooses varies greatly, and often it is a very curious\r\none. The temperature of a furnace appears to suit the young Pelopæus:\r\nat least the favourite site is the chimney, on either side of the flue,\r\nup to a height of twenty inches or so. This snug shelter has its\r\ndrawbacks. The smoke gets to the nests, and gives them a glaze of brown\r\nor black like that which covers the stonework. They might easily be\r\ntaken for inequalities in the mortar. This is not a serious matter,\r\nprovided that the flames do not lick against the nests. That would stew\r\nthe young Wasps to death in their clay pots. But the mother Wasps seems\r\nto understand this: she only places her family in chimneys that are too\r\nwide for anything but smoke to reach their sides.\r\n\r\nBut in spite of all her caution one danger remains. It sometimes\r\nhappens, while the Wasp is building, that the approach to the\r\nhalf-built dwelling is barred to her for a time, or even for the whole\r\nday, by a curtain of steam or smoke. Washing-days are most risky. From\r\nmorning till night the housewife keeps the huge cauldron boiling. The\r\nsmoke from the hearth, the steam from the cauldron and the wash-tub,\r\nform a dense mist in front of the fireplace.\r\n\r\nIt is told of the Water-Ouzel that, to get back to his nest, he will\r\nfly through the cataract under a mill-weir. This Wasp is even more\r\ndaring: with her pellet of mud in her teeth she crosses the cloud of\r\nsmoke and disappears behind it, where she becomes invisible, so thick\r\nis the screen. An irregular chirring sound, the song she sings at her\r\nwork, alone betrays her presence. The building goes on mysteriously\r\nbehind the cloud. The song ceases, and the Wasp flies back through the\r\nsteam, quite unharmed. She will face this danger repeatedly all day,\r\nuntil the cell is built, stored with food, and closed.\r\n\r\nOnce and once only I was able to observe a Pelopæus at my own fireside;\r\nand, as it happened, it was a washing-day. I had not long been\r\nappointed to the Avignon grammar-school. It was close upon two o’clock,\r\nand in a few minutes the roll of the drum would summon me to give a\r\nscientific lecture to an audience of wool-gatherers. Suddenly I saw a\r\nstrange, agile insect dart through the steam that rose from the\r\nwash-tub. The front part of its body was very thin, and the back part\r\nwas very plump, and the two parts were joined together by a long\r\nthread. It was the Pelopæus, the first I had seen with observant eyes.\r\n\r\nBeing very anxious to become better acquainted with my visitor, I\r\nfervently entreated the household not to disturb her in my absence.\r\nThings went better than I dared hope. On my return she was still\r\ncarrying on her mason’s work behind the steam. Being eager to see the\r\nbuilding of the cells, the nature of the provisions, and the evolution\r\nof the young Wasps, I raked the fire so as to decrease the volume of\r\nsmoke, and for a good two hours I watched the mother Wasp diving\r\nthrough the cloud.\r\n\r\nNever again, in the forty years that followed, was my fireplace\r\nhonoured with such a visit. All the further information I have gathered\r\nwas gleaned on the hearths of my neighbours.\r\n\r\nThe Pelopæus, it appears, is of a solitary and vagrant disposition. She\r\nnearly always builds a lonely nest, and unlike many Wasps and Bees, she\r\nseldom founds her family at the spot where she was reared herself. She\r\nis often found in our southern towns, but on the whole she prefers the\r\npeasant’s smoky house to the townsman’s white villa. Nowhere have I\r\nseen her so plentiful as in my village, with its tumble-down cottages\r\nburnt yellow by the sun.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that this Wasp, when she so often chooses the chimney as\r\nher abode, is not seeking her own comfort: the site means work, and\r\ndangerous work. She seeks the welfare of her family. This family, then,\r\nmust require a high temperature, such as other Wasps and Bees do not\r\nneed.\r\n\r\nI have seen a Pelopæus nest in the engine-room of a silk-factory, fixed\r\nto the ceiling just above the huge boiler. At this spot the thermometer\r\nmarked 120 degrees all through the year, except at night and on\r\nholidays.\r\n\r\nIn a country distillery I have found many nests, fixed on anything that\r\ncame to hand, even a pile of account-books. The temperature of one of\r\nthese, quite close to the still, was 113 degrees. It is plain that this\r\nWasp cheerfully endures a degree of heat that makes the oily palm-tree\r\nsprout.\r\n\r\nA boiler or a furnace she regards as the ideal home, but she is quite\r\nwilling to content herself in any snug corner: a conservatory, a\r\nkitchen-ceiling, the recess of a closed window, the wall of a cottage\r\nbedroom. As to the foundation on which she fixes her nest, she is\r\nentirely indifferent. As a rule she builds her groups of cells on\r\nstonework or timber; but at various times I have seen nests inside a\r\ngourd, in a fur cap, in the hollow of a brick, on the side of a bag of\r\noats, and in a piece of lead tubing.\r\n\r\nOnce I saw something more remarkable still, in a farm near Avignon. In\r\na large room with a very wide fireplace the soup for the farm-hands and\r\nthe food for the cattle simmered in a row of pots. The labourers used\r\nto come in from the fields to this room, and devour their meal with the\r\nsilent haste that comes from a keen appetite. To enjoy this half-hour\r\ncomfortably they would take off their hats and smocks, and hang them on\r\npegs. Short though this meal was, it was long enough to allow the Wasps\r\nto take possession of their garments. The inside of a straw hat was\r\nrecognised as a most useful building-site, the folds of a smock were\r\nlooked upon as a capital shelter; and the work of building started at\r\nonce. On rising from the table one of the men would shake his smock,\r\nand another his hat, to rid it of the Wasp’s nest, which was already\r\nthe size of an acorn.\r\n\r\nThe cook in that farmhouse regarded the Wasps with no friendly eye.\r\nThey dirtied everything, she said. Dabs of mud on the ceiling, on the\r\nwalls, or on the chimney-piece you could put up with; but it was a very\r\ndifferent matter when you found them on the linen and the curtains. She\r\nhad to beat the curtains every day with a bamboo. And it was trouble\r\nthrown away. The next morning the Wasps began building as busily as\r\never.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nHER BUILDING\r\n\r\nI sympathised with the sorrows of that farm-cook, but greatly regretted\r\nthat I could not take her place. How gladly I would have left the Wasps\r\nundisturbed, even if they had covered all the furniture with mud! How I\r\nlonged to know what the fate of a nest would be, if perched on the\r\nuncertain support of a coat or a curtain! The nest of the Mason-bee is\r\nmade of hard mortar, which surrounds the twig on which it is built, and\r\nbecomes firmly fixed to it; but the nest of the Pelopæus Wasp is a mere\r\nblob of mud, without cement or foundations.\r\n\r\nThe materials of which it is made are nothing but wet earth or dirt,\r\npicked up wherever the soil is damp enough. The thin clay of a\r\nriver-bank is very suitable, but in my stony country streams are rare.\r\nI can, however, watch the builders at my leisure in my own garden, when\r\na thin trickle of water runs all day, as it does sometimes, through the\r\nlittle trenches that are cut in my vegetable plots.\r\n\r\nThe Pelopæus Wasps of the neighbourhood soon become aware of this glad\r\nevent, and come hurrying up to take advantage of the precious layer of\r\nmud, a rare discovery in the dry season. They scrape and skim the\r\ngleaming, shiny surface with their mandibles while standing high on\r\ntheir legs, with their wings quivering and their black bodies upraised.\r\nNo neat little housewife, with skirts carefully tucked up out of the\r\ndirt, could be more skilful in tackling a job likely to soil her\r\nclothes. These mud-gatherers have not an atom of dirt upon them, so\r\ncareful are they to tuck up their skirts in their own fashion, that is\r\nto say, to keep their whole body out of the way, all but the tips of\r\ntheir legs and the busy points of the mandibles with which they work.\r\n\r\nIn this way a dab of mud is collected, almost the size of a pea. Taking\r\nthe load in its teeth the insect flies off, adds a layer to its\r\nbuilding, and soon returns to collect another pellet. The same method\r\nis pursued as long as the earth remains sufficiently wet, during the\r\nhottest hours of the day.\r\n\r\nBut the favourite spot is the great fountain in the village, where the\r\npeople come to water their mules. Here there is a constant sheet of\r\nblack mud which neither the hottest sunshine nor the strongest wind can\r\ndry. This bed of mire is very unpleasant for the passers-by, but the\r\nPelopæus loves to gather her pellets here, amid the hoofs of the mules.\r\n\r\nUnlike some builders in clay, such as the Mason-bees, the Wasp does not\r\nimprove the mud to make it into mortar, but uses it just as it is.\r\nConsequently her nests are flimsy work, absolutely unfitted to stand\r\nthe changes and chances of the open air. A drop of water laid upon\r\ntheir surface softens the spot touched and reduces it to mud again,\r\nwhile a sprinkling equal to an average shower turns it to pap. They are\r\nnothing but dried slime, and become slime again as soon as they are\r\nwetted.\r\n\r\nIt is plain, then, that even if the young Pelopæus were not so chilly\r\nby nature, a shelter is indispensable for the nests, which would go to\r\npieces at the first shower of rain. That is why this Wasp is so fond of\r\nhuman dwellings, and especially of the chimney.\r\n\r\nBefore receiving its final coating, which covers up the details of the\r\nbuilding, the nest has a certain beauty of its own. It consists of a\r\ncluster of cells, sometimes arranged side by side in a row—which makes\r\nit look rather like a mouth-organ—but more often grouped in layers\r\nplaced one above the other. I have sometimes counted as many as fifteen\r\ncells; some nests contain only ten; others are reduced to three or\r\nfour, or even only one.\r\n\r\nIn shape the cells are not far from cylinders, slightly larger at the\r\nmouth than at the base. They are a little more than an inch long, and\r\nabout half an inch wide. Their delicate surface is carefully polished,\r\nand shows a series of string-like projections, running cross-wise, not\r\nunlike the twisted cords of some kinds of gold-lace. Each of these\r\nstrings is a layer of the building; it comes from the clod of mud used\r\nfor the coping of the part already built. By counting them you can tell\r\nhow many journeys the Wasp has made in the course of her work. There\r\nare usually between fifteen and twenty. For one cell, therefore, the\r\nindustrious builder fetches materials something like twenty times.\r\n\r\nThe mouth of the cells is, of course, always turned upwards. A pot\r\ncannot hold its contents if it be upside down. And the Wasp’s cell is\r\nnothing but a pot intended to hold the store of food, a pile of small\r\nSpiders.\r\n\r\nThe cells—built one by one, stuffed full of Spiders, and closed as the\r\neggs are laid—preserve their pretty appearance until the cluster is\r\nconsidered large enough. Then, to strengthen her work, the Wasp covers\r\nthe whole with a casing, as a protection and defence. She lays on the\r\nplaster without stint and without art, giving it none of the delicate\r\nfinishing-touches which she lavishes on the cells. The mud is applied\r\njust as it is brought, and merely spread with a few careless strokes.\r\nThe beauties of the building all disappear under this ugly husk. In\r\nthis final state the nest is like a great splash of mud, flung against\r\nthe wall by accident.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nHER PROVISIONS\r\n\r\nNow that we know what the provision-jar is like, we must find out what\r\nit contains.\r\n\r\nThe young Pelopæus is fed on Spiders. The food does not lack variety,\r\neven in the same nest and the same cell, for any Spider may form a\r\nmeal, as long as it is not too large for the jar. The Cross Spider,\r\nwith three crosses of white dots on her back, is the dish that occurs\r\noftenest. I think the reason for this is simply that the Wasp does not\r\ngo far from home in her hunting-trips, and the Spider with the crosses\r\nis the easiest to find.\r\n\r\nThe Spider, armed with poison-fangs, is a dangerous prey to tackle.\r\nWhen of fair size, she could only be conquered by a greater amount of\r\ndaring and skill than the Wasp possesses. Moreover, the cells are too\r\nsmall to hold a bulky object. The Wasp, therefore, hunts game of\r\nmoderate size. If she meets with a kind of Spider that is apt to become\r\nplump, she always chooses a young one. But, though all are small, the\r\nsize of her victims varies enormously, and this variation in size leads\r\nalso to variation in number. One cell will contain a dozen Spiders,\r\nwhile in another there are only five or six.\r\n\r\nAnother reason for her choice of small Spiders is that she kills them\r\nbefore potting them in her cells. She falls suddenly upon her prey, and\r\ncarries it off almost without pausing in her flight. The skilful\r\nparalysis practised by some insects is unknown to her. This means that\r\nwhen the food is stored it soon decays. Fortunately the Spiders are\r\nsmall enough to be finished at a single meal. If they were large and\r\ncould only be nibbled here and there, they would decay, and poison the\r\ngrubs in the nest.\r\n\r\nI always find the egg, not on the surface of the heap, but on the first\r\nSpider that was stored. There is no exception to this rule. The Wasp\r\nplaces a Spider at the bottom of the cell, lays her egg upon it, and\r\nthen piles the other Spiders on the top. By this clever plan the grub\r\nis obliged to begin on the oldest of the dead Spiders, and then go on\r\nto the more recent. It always finds in front of it food that has not\r\nhad time to decompose.\r\n\r\nThe egg is always laid on the same part of the Spider, the end\r\ncontaining the head being placed on the plumpest spot. This is very\r\npleasant for the grub, for the moment it is hatched it can begin eating\r\nthe tenderest and nicest food in the store. Not a mouthful is wasted,\r\nhowever, by these economical creatures. When the meal is finished there\r\nis practically nothing left of the whole heap of Spiders. This life of\r\ngluttony lasts for eight or ten days.\r\n\r\nThe grub then sets to work to spin its cocoon, a sack of pure,\r\nperfectly white silk, extremely delicate. Something more is required to\r\nmake this sack tough enough to be a protection, so the grub produces\r\nfrom its body a sort of liquid varnish. As soon as it trickles into the\r\nmeshes of the silk this varnish hardens, and becomes a lacquer of\r\nexquisite daintiness. The grub then fixes a hard plug at the base of\r\nthe cocoon to make all secure.\r\n\r\nWhen finished, the work is amber-yellow, and rather reminds one of the\r\nouter skin of an onion. It has the same fine texture, the same colour\r\nand transparency; and like the onion skin it rustles when it is\r\nfingered. From it, sooner or later according to temperature, the\r\nperfect insect is hatched.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is possible, while the Wasp is storing her cell, to play her a trick\r\nwhich will show how purely mechanical her instincts are. A cell has\r\njust been completed, let us suppose, and the huntress arrives with her\r\nfirst Spider. She stores it away, and at once fastens her egg on the\r\nplumpest part of its body. She sets out on a second trip. I take\r\nadvantage of her absence to remove with my tweezers from the bottom of\r\nthe cell both the dead Spider and the egg.\r\n\r\nThe disappearance of the egg must be discovered by the Wasp, one would\r\nthink, if she possesses the least gleam of intelligence. The egg is\r\nsmall, it is true, but it lies on a comparatively large object, the\r\nSpider. What will the Wasp do when she finds the cell empty? Will she\r\nact sensibly, and repair her loss by laying a second egg? Not at all;\r\nshe behaves most absurdly.\r\n\r\nWhat she does is to bring a second Spider, which she stores away with\r\nas much cheerful zeal as if nothing unfortunate had occurred. She\r\nbrings a third and a fourth, and still others, each of whom I remove\r\nduring her absence; so that every time she returns from the chase the\r\nstoreroom is found empty. I have seen her persist obstinately for two\r\ndays in seeking to fill the insatiable jar, while my patience in\r\nemptying it was equally unflagging. With the twentieth victim—possibly\r\nowing to the fatigue of so many journeys—the huntress considered that\r\nthe pot was sufficiently supplied, and began most carefully to close\r\nthe cell that contained absolutely nothing.\r\n\r\nThe intelligence of insects is limited everywhere in this way. The\r\naccidental difficulty which one insect is powerless to overcome, any\r\nother, no matter what its species, will be equally unable to cope with.\r\nI could give a host of similar examples to show that insects are\r\nabsolutely without reasoning power, notwithstanding the wonderful\r\nperfection of their work. A long series of experiments has forced me to\r\nconclude that they are neither free nor conscious in their industry.\r\nThey build, weave, hunt, stab, and paralyse their prey, in the same way\r\nas they digest their food, or secrete the poison of their sting,\r\nwithout the least understanding of the means or the end. They are, I am\r\nconvinced, completely ignorant of their own wonderful talents.\r\n\r\nTheir instinct cannot be changed. Experience does not teach it; time\r\ndoes not awaken a glimmer in its unconsciousness. Pure instinct, if it\r\nstood alone, would leave the insect powerless in the face of\r\ncircumstances. Yet circumstances are always changing, the unexpected is\r\nalways happening. In this confusion some power is needed by the\r\ninsect—as by every other creature—to teach it what to accept and what\r\nto refuse. It requires a guide of some kind, and this guide it\r\ncertainly possesses. Intelligence is too fine a word for it: I will\r\ncall it discernment.\r\n\r\nIs the insect conscious of what it does? Yes, and no. No, if its action\r\nis guided by instinct. Yes, if its action is the result of discernment.\r\n\r\nThe Pelopæus, for instance, builds her cells with earth already\r\nsoftened into mud. This is instinct. She has always built in this way.\r\nNeither the passing ages nor the struggle for life will induce her to\r\nimitate the Mason-bee and make her nest of dry dust and cement.\r\n\r\nThis mud nest of hers needs a shelter against the rain. A hiding-place\r\nunder a stone, perhaps, sufficed at first. But when she found something\r\nbetter she took possession of it. She installed herself in the home of\r\nman. This is discernment.\r\n\r\nShe supplies her young with food in the form of Spiders. This is\r\ninstinct, and nothing will ever persuade her that young Crickets are\r\njust as good. But should there be a lack of her favourite Cross Spider\r\nshe will not leave her grubs unfed; she will bring them other Spiders.\r\nThis is discernment.\r\n\r\nIn this quality of discernment lies the possibility of future\r\nimprovement for the insect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nHER ORIGIN\r\n\r\nThe Pelopæus sets us another problem. She seeks the warmth of our\r\nfireplaces. Her nest, built of soft mud which would be reduced to pulp\r\nby damp, must have a dry shelter. Heat is a necessity to her.\r\n\r\nIs it possible that she is a foreigner? Did she come, perhaps, from the\r\nshores of Africa, from the land of dates to the land of olives? It\r\nwould be natural, in that case, that she should find our sunshine not\r\nwarm enough for her, and should seek the artificial warmth of the\r\nfireside. This would explain her habits, so unlike those of the other\r\nWasps, by all of whom mankind is avoided.\r\n\r\nWhat was her life before she became our guest? Where did she lodge\r\nbefore there were any houses? Where did she shelter her grubs before\r\nchimneys were thought of?\r\n\r\nPerhaps, when the early inhabitants of the hills near Sérignan were\r\nmaking weapons out of flints, scraping goatskins for clothes, and\r\nbuilding huts of mud and branches, those huts were already frequented\r\nby the Pelopæus. Perhaps she built her nest in some bulging pot, shaped\r\nout of clay by the thumbs of our ancestors; or in the folds of the\r\ngarments, the skins of the Wolf and the Bear. When she made her home on\r\nthe rough walls of branches and clay, did she choose the nearest spot,\r\nI wonder, to the hole in the roof by which the smoke was let out?\r\nThough not equal to our chimneys it may have served at a pinch.\r\n\r\nIf the Pelopæus really lived here with the earliest human inhabitants,\r\nwhat improvements she has seen! She too must have profited greatly by\r\ncivilisation: she has turned man’s increasing comfort into her own.\r\nWhen the dwelling with a roof and a ceiling was planned, and the\r\nchimney with a flue was invented, we can imagine the chilly creature\r\nsaying to herself:\r\n\r\n“How pleasant this is! Let us pitch our tent here.”\r\n\r\nBut we will go back further still. Before huts existed, before the\r\nniche in the rut, before man himself had appeared, where did the\r\nPelopæus build? The question does not stand alone. Where did the\r\nSwallow and the Sparrow build before there were windows and chimneys to\r\nbuild in?\r\n\r\nSince the Swallow, the Sparrow, and the Wasp existed before man, their\r\nindustry cannot be dependent on the works of man. Each of them must\r\nhave had an art of building in the time when man was not here.\r\n\r\nFor thirty years and more I asked myself where the Pelopæus lived in\r\nthose times. Outside our houses I could find no trace of her nests. At\r\nlast chance, which favours the persevering, came to my help.\r\n\r\nThe Sérignan quarries are full of broken stones, of refuse that has\r\nbeen piled there in the course of centuries. Here the Fieldmouse\r\ncrunches his olive-stones and acorns, or now and then a Snail. The\r\nempty Snail-shells lie here and there beneath a stone, and within them\r\ndifferent Bees and Wasps build their cells. In searching for these\r\ntreasures I found, three times, the nest of a Pelopæus among the broken\r\nstones.\r\n\r\nThese three nests were exactly the same as those found in our houses.\r\nThe material was mud, as always; the protective covering was the same\r\nmud. The dangers of the site had suggested no improvements to the\r\nbuilder. We see, then, that sometimes, but very rarely, the Pelopæus\r\nbuilds in stoneheaps and under flat blocks of stone that do not touch\r\nthe ground. It was in such places as these that she must have made her\r\nnest before she invaded our houses.\r\n\r\nThe three nests, however, were in a piteous state. The damp and\r\nexposure had ruined them, and the cocoons were in pieces. Unprotected\r\nby their earthen cover the grubs had perished—eaten by a Fieldmouse or\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nThe sight of these ruins made me wonder if my neighbourhood were really\r\na suitable place for the Pelopæus to build her nest out of doors. It is\r\nplain that the mother Wasp dislikes doing so, and is hardly ever driven\r\nto such a desperate measure. And if the climate makes it impossible for\r\nher to practise the industry of her forefathers successfully, I think\r\nwe may conclude that she is a foreigner. Surely she comes from a hotter\r\nand drier climate, where there is little rain and no snow.\r\n\r\nI believe the Pelopæus is of African origin. Far back in the past she\r\ncame to us through Spain and Italy, and she hardly ever goes further\r\nnorth than the olive-trees. She is an African who has become a\r\nnaturalised Provençal. In Africa she is said often to nest under\r\nstones, but in the Malay Archipelago we hear of her kinswoman in\r\nhouses. From one end of the world to the other she has the same\r\ntastes—Spiders, mud cells, and the shelter of a man’s roof. If I were\r\nin the Malay Archipelago I should turn over the stone-heaps, and should\r\nmost likely discover a nest in the original position, under a flat\r\nstone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE PSYCHES\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nA WELL-DRESSED CATERPILLAR\r\n\r\nIn the springtime, those who have eyes to see may find a surprise on\r\nold walls and dusty roads. Certain tiny faggots, for no apparent\r\nreason, set themselves in motion and make their way along by sudden\r\njerks. The lifeless comes to life: the immovable moves. This is indeed\r\namazing. If we look closer, however, we shall solve the riddle.\r\n\r\nEnclosed within the moving bundle is a fair-sized Caterpillar, prettily\r\nstriped with black and white. He is seeking for food, and perhaps for\r\nsome spot where he can turn into a Moth. He hurries along timidly,\r\ndressed in a queer garment of twigs, which completely covers the whole\r\nof him except his head and the front part of his body, with its six\r\nshort legs. At the least alarm he disappears entirely into his case,\r\nand does not budge again. This is the secret of the walking bundle of\r\nsticks. It is a Faggot Caterpillar, belonging to the group known as the\r\nPsyches.\r\n\r\nTo protect himself from the weather the chilly, bare-skinned Psyche\r\nbuilds himself a portable shelter, a travelling cottage which the owner\r\nnever leaves until he becomes a Moth. It is, indeed, something better\r\nthan a hut on wheels, with a thatched roof to it: it is more like a\r\nhermit’s frock, made of an unusual kind of material. In the valley of\r\nthe Danube the peasant wears a goatskin cloak fastened with a belt of\r\nrushes. The Psyche wears even rougher raiment than this: he makes\r\nhimself a suit of clothes out of sticks. And since this would be a\r\nregular hair-shirt to a skin so delicate as his, he puts in a thick\r\nlining of silk.\r\n\r\nIn April, on the walls of my chief workshop—my stony harmas with its\r\nwealth of insect life—I find the Psyche who will supply me with my most\r\ndetailed information. He is in the torpid state which shows he will\r\nsoon become a Moth. It is a good opportunity for examining his bundle\r\nof sticks, or case.\r\n\r\nIt is a fairly regular object, shaped like a spindle, and about an inch\r\nand a half long. The pieces that compose it are fixed in front and free\r\nat the back. They are arranged anyhow, and would form rather a poor\r\nshelter against the sun and rain if the hermit had no other protection\r\nthan this.\r\n\r\nAt the first glance it appears like thatch; but thatch is not an exact\r\ndescription of it, for grain-stems are rarely found in it. The chief\r\nmaterials are remnants of very small stalks, light, soft, and rich in\r\npith; next in order come bits of grass-leaves, scaly twigs from the\r\ncypress-tree, and all sorts of little sticks; and lastly, if the\r\nfavourite pieces run short, fragments of dry leaves.\r\n\r\nIn short the Caterpillar, while preferring pithy pieces, will use\r\nanything he comes across, provided it be light, very dry, softened by\r\nlong exposure, and of the right size. All his materials are used just\r\nas they are, without any alterations or sawings to make them the proper\r\nlength. He does not cut the laths that form his roof; he gathers them\r\nas he finds them. His work is limited to fixing them at the fore-end.\r\n\r\nIn order to lend itself to the movements of the travelling Caterpillar,\r\nand particularly to enable the head and legs to move freely while a new\r\npiece is being fixed in position, the front part of this case or sheath\r\nmust be made in a special way. Here a casing of sticks is no longer\r\nsuitable, for their length and stiffness would hamper the workman and\r\neven make his work impossible. What is required here is a flexible\r\nneck, able to move in all directions. The collection of stakes,\r\ntherefore, ends suddenly at some distance from the fore-part, and is\r\nthere replaced by a collar where the silk lining is merely hardened\r\nwith very tiny particles of wood, which strengthen the material without\r\nmaking it less flexible. This collar, which allows of free movement, is\r\nso important that all the Psyches use it, however greatly the rest of\r\ntheir work may differ. All carry, in front of the bundle of sticks, a\r\nyielding neck, soft to the touch, formed inside of a web of pure silk\r\nand coated outside with a velvety sawdust, which the Caterpillar\r\nobtains by crushing up any sort of dry straw.\r\n\r\nThe same kind of velvet, but dull and faded—apparently through\r\nage—finishes the sheath at the back, in the form of a rather long\r\nprojection, open at the end.\r\n\r\nWhen I remove the outside of the straw casing, shredding it piece by\r\npiece, I find a varying number of laths, or tiny sticks. I have counted\r\nas many as eighty, and more. Underneath it I find, from one end of the\r\nCaterpillar to the other, the same kind of inner sheath that was\r\nformerly visible at the front and back only. This inner sheath is\r\ncomposed everywhere of very strong silk, which resists without breaking\r\nwhen pulled by the fingers. It is a smooth tissue, beautifully white\r\ninside, drab and wrinkled outside, where it bristles with a crust of\r\nwoody particles.\r\n\r\nLater on we shall see how the Caterpillar makes himself this\r\ncomplicated garment, formed of three layers, one placed upon the other\r\nin a definite order. First comes the extremely fine satin which is in\r\ndirect contact with the skin; next, the mixed stuff dusted with woody\r\nmatter, which saves the silk and gives strength to the work; and lastly\r\nthe outer casing of overlapping sticks.\r\n\r\nAlthough all the Psyches wear this threefold garment, the different\r\nspecies make distinct variations in the outer case. There is one kind,\r\nfor instance, whom I am apt to meet towards the end of June, hurrying\r\nacross some dusty path near the houses. His case surpasses that of the\r\nfirst species, both in size and in regularity of arrangement. It forms\r\na thick coverlet of many pieces, in which I recognise fragments of\r\nhollow stalks, bits of fine straw, and perhaps blades of grass. In\r\nfront there is never any flounce of dead leaves, a troublesome piece of\r\nfinery which is pretty frequent, though not always used, in the costume\r\nof the first species I described. At the back there is no long\r\nprojection beyond the outer covering. Save for the indispensable collar\r\nat the neck, the whole Caterpillar is cased in sticks. There is not\r\nmuch variety about the thing, but, when all is said, there is a certain\r\nbeauty in its stern faultlessness.\r\n\r\nThere is a smaller and more simply dressed Psyche who is very common at\r\nthe end of winter on the walls, as well as in the bark of gnarled old\r\ntrees, whether olive-trees or elms, or indeed almost any other. His\r\ncase, a modest little bundle, is hardly more than two-fifths of an inch\r\nin length. A dozen rotten straws, picked up at random and fixed close\r\nto one another in a parallel direction, represent, with the silk\r\nsheath, his whole outlay on dress.\r\n\r\nIt would be difficult to clothe oneself more economically.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nA DEVOTED MOTHER\r\n\r\nIf I gather a number of little Psyches in April and place them in a\r\nwire bell-jar, I can find out more about them. Most of them are in the\r\nchrysalis state, waiting to be turned into Moths, but a few are still\r\nactive and clamber to the top of the wire trellis. There they fix\r\nthemselves by means of a little silk cushion, and both they and I must\r\nwait for weeks before anything further happens.\r\n\r\nAt the end of June the male Psyche comes out of his case, no longer a\r\nCaterpillar, but a Moth. The case, or bundle of sticks, you will\r\nremember, had two openings, one in front and one at the back. The front\r\none, which is the more regular and carefully made, is permanently\r\nclosed by being fastened to the support on which the chrysalis is\r\nfixed; so the Moth, when he is hatched, is obliged to come out by the\r\nopening at the back. The Caterpillar turns round inside the case before\r\nhe changes into a Moth.\r\n\r\nThough they wear but a simple pearl-grey dress and have insignificant\r\nwings, hardly larger than those of a Common Fly, these little male\r\nMoths are graceful enough. They have handsome feathery plumes for\r\nantennæ, and their wings are edged with delicate fringes. For the\r\nappearance of the female Psyche, however, little can be said.\r\n\r\nSome days later than the others she comes out of the sheath, and shows\r\nherself in all her wretchedness. Call that little fright a Moth! One\r\ncannot easily get used to the idea of so miserable a sight: as a\r\nCaterpillar she was no worse to look at. There are no wings, none at\r\nall; there is no silky fur either. At the tip of her round, tufty body\r\nshe wears a crown of dirty-white velvet; on each segment, in the middle\r\nof the back, is a large, rectangular, dark patch—her sole attempts at\r\nornament. The mother Psyche renounces all the beauty which her name of\r\nMoth seems to promise.\r\n\r\nAs she leaves her chrysalid sheath she lays her eggs within it, thus\r\nbequeathing the maternal cottage (or the maternal garment, if you will)\r\nto her heirs. As she lays a great many eggs the affair takes some\r\nthirty hours. When the laying is finished she closes the door and makes\r\neverything safe against invasion. For this purpose some kind of wadding\r\nis required. The fond mother makes use of the only ornament which, in\r\nher extreme poverty, she possesses. She wedges the door with the\r\ncoronet of velvet which she carries at the tip of her body.\r\n\r\nFinally she does even more than this. She makes a rampart of her body\r\nitself. With a convulsive movement she dies on the threshold of her\r\nrecent home, her cast chrysalid skin, and there her remains dry up.\r\nEven after death she stays at her post.\r\n\r\nIf the outer case be now opened it will be found to contain the\r\nchrysalid wrapper, uninjured except for the opening in front, by which\r\nthe Psyche came out. The male Moth, when obliged to make his way\r\nthrough the narrow pass, would find his wings and his plumes very\r\ncumbersome articles. For this reason he makes a start for the door\r\nwhile he is still in the chrysalis state, and comes half-way out. Then,\r\nas he bursts his amber-coloured tunic, he finds, right in front of him,\r\nan open space where flight is possible.\r\n\r\nBut the mother Moth, being unprovided with wings and plumes, is not\r\ncompelled to take any such precautions. Her cylinder-like form is bare,\r\nand differs very little from that of the Caterpillar. It allows her to\r\ncrawl, to slip into the narrow passage, and to come forth without\r\ndifficulty. So she leaves her cast skin behind her, right at the back\r\nof the case, well covered by the thatched roof.\r\n\r\nAnd this is an act of prudence, showing her deep concern for the fate\r\nof her eggs. They are, in fact, packed as though in a barrel, in the\r\nparchment-like bag formed by the cast skin. The Moth has methodically\r\ngone on laying eggs in that receptacle till it is full. Not satisfied\r\nwith bequeathing her house and her velvet coronet to her offspring, as\r\nthe last act of her life she leaves them her skin.\r\n\r\nWishing to observe the course of events at my ease I once took one of\r\nthese chrysalid bags, stuffed with eggs, from its outer casing of\r\nsticks, and placed it by itself, beside its case, in a glass tube. In\r\nthe first week of July I suddenly found myself in possession of a large\r\nfamily. The hatching took place so quickly that the new-born\r\nCaterpillars, about forty in number, had already clothed themselves in\r\nmy absence.\r\n\r\nThey wore a garment like a sort of Persian head-dress, in dazzling\r\nwhite plush. Or, to be more commonplace, a white cotton night-cap\r\nwithout a tassel. Strange to say, however, instead of wearing their\r\ncaps on their heads, they wore them standing up from their\r\nhind-quarters, almost perpendicularly. They roamed about gaily inside\r\nthe tube, which was a spacious dwelling for such mites. I was quite\r\ndetermined to find out with what materials and in what manner the first\r\noutlines of the cap were woven.\r\n\r\nFortunately the chrysalid bag was far from being empty. I found within\r\nthe rumpled wrapper a second family as numerous as those already out of\r\nthe case. Altogether there must have been five or six dozen eggs. I\r\ntransferred to another place the little Caterpillars who were already\r\ndressed, keeping only the naked new-comers in the tube. They had bright\r\nred heads; the rest of their bodies was dirty-white; and they measured\r\nhardly a twenty-fifth of an inch in length.\r\n\r\nI had not long to wait. The next day, little by little, singly or in\r\ngroups, the little laggards left the chrysalid bag. They came out\r\nwithout breaking that frail object, through the opening in front made\r\nby their mother. Not one of them used it as a dress-material, though it\r\nhad the delicacy and amber colouring of an onion-skin; nor did any of\r\nthem make use of a certain fine quilting that lines the inside of the\r\nbag and forms an exquisitely soft bed for the eggs. One would have\r\nthought this downy stuff would make an excellent blanket for the chilly\r\ncreatures, but not a single one used it. There would not be enough to\r\ngo round.\r\n\r\nThey all went straight to the coarse outer casing of sticks, which I\r\nhad left in contact with the chrysalid skin containing the eggs. The\r\nmatter was urgent, they evidently felt. Before making your entrance\r\ninto the world and going a-hunting, you must first be clad. All\r\ntherefore, with equal fury, attacked the old sheath and hastily dressed\r\nthemselves in their mother’s old clothes.\r\n\r\nSome turned their attention to bits that happened to be opened\r\nlengthwise, scraping the soft white inner layer; others, greatly\r\ndaring, penetrated into the tunnel of a hollow stalk and collected\r\ntheir materials in the dark. The courage of these was rewarded; they\r\nsecured first-rate materials and wove garments of dazzling white. There\r\nwere others who bit deeply into the piece they chose, and made\r\nthemselves a motley covering, in which the snowy whiteness was marred\r\nby darker particles.\r\n\r\nThe tools the little Caterpillars use for this purpose are their\r\nmandibles, which are shaped like wide shears and have five strong teeth\r\napiece. The two blades fit into each other, and form an instrument\r\ncapable of seizing and slicing any fibre, however small. Under the\r\nmicroscope it is seen to be a wonderful specimen of mechanical\r\nprecision and power. If the Sheep had a similar tool in proportion to\r\nher size, she could browse on the stems of trees instead of the grass.\r\n\r\nIt is very instructive to watch these Psyche-grubs toiling to make\r\nthemselves a cotton night-cap. There are numbers of things to remark,\r\nboth in the finish of the work and the skill of the methods they\r\nemploy. They are so tiny that while I observe them through my\r\nmagnifying glass I must be careful not to breathe, lest I should\r\noverturn them or puff them away. Yet this speck is expert in the art of\r\nblanket-making. An orphan, born but a moment ago, it knows how to cut\r\nitself a garment out of its mother’s old clothes. Of its methods I will\r\ntell you more presently, but first I must say another word with regard\r\nto its dead mother.\r\n\r\nI have spoken of the downy quilting that covers the inside of the\r\nchrysalid bag. It is like a bed of eiderdown, on which the little\r\nCaterpillars rest for a while after leaving the egg. Warmly nestling in\r\nthis soft rug they prepare themselves for their plunge into the outer\r\nworld of work.\r\n\r\nThe Eider robs herself of her down to make a luxurious bed for her\r\nbrood; the mother Rabbit shears from her own body the softest part of\r\nher fur to provide a mattress for her new-born family. And the same\r\nthing is done by the Psyche.\r\n\r\nThe mass of soft wadding that makes a warm coverlet for the baby\r\nCaterpillar is a material of incomparable delicacy. Through the\r\nmicroscope it can be recognised as the scaly dust, the intensely fine\r\ndown in which every Moth is clad. To give a snug shelter to the little\r\ngrubs who will soon be swarming in the case, to provide them with a\r\nrefuge in which they can play about and gather strength before entering\r\nthe wide world, the Psyche strips herself of her fur like the mother\r\nRabbit.\r\n\r\nThis may possibly be done mechanically; it may be the unintentional\r\neffect of rubbing repeatedly against the low-roofed walls; but there is\r\nnothing to tell us so. Even the humblest mother has her foresight. It\r\nis quite likely that the hairy Moth twists about, and goes to and fro\r\nin the narrow passage, in order to get rid of her fleece and prepare\r\nbedding for her family.\r\n\r\nI have read in books that the young Psyches begin life by eating up\r\ntheir mother. I have seen nothing of the sort, and I do not even\r\nunderstand how the idea arose. Indeed, she has given up so much for her\r\nfamily that there is nothing left of her but some thin, dry strips—not\r\nenough to provide a meal for so numerous a brood. No, my little\r\nPsyches, you do not eat your mother. In vain do I watch you: never,\r\neither to clothe or to feed himself, does any one of you lay a tooth\r\nupon the remains of the deceased.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nA CLEVER TAILOR\r\n\r\nI will now describe in greater detail the dressing of the grubs.\r\n\r\nThe hatching of the eggs takes place in the first fortnight of July.\r\nThe head and upper part of the little grubs are of a glossy black, the\r\nnext two segments are brownish, and the rest of the body is a pale\r\namber. They are sharp, lively little creatures, who run about with\r\nshort, quick steps.\r\n\r\nFor a time, after they are out of the bag where they are hatched, they\r\nremain in the heap of fluff that was stripped from their mother. Here\r\nthere is more room, and more comfort too, than in the bag whence they\r\ncame; and while some take a rest, others bustle about and exercise\r\nthemselves in walking. They are all picking up strength before leaving\r\nthe outer case.\r\n\r\nThey do not stay long amid this luxury. Gradually, as they gain vigour,\r\nthey come out and spread over the surface of the case. Work begins at\r\nonce, a very urgent work—that of dressing themselves. By and by they\r\nwill think of food: at present nothing is of any importance but\r\nclothes.\r\n\r\nMontaigne, when putting on a cloak which his father had worn before\r\nhim, used to say, “I dress myself in my father.” Well, the young\r\nPsyches in the same way dress themselves in their mother. (In the same\r\nway, it must be remembered; not in her skin, but in her clothes.) From\r\nthe outer case of sticks, which I have sometimes described as a house\r\nand sometimes as a garment, they scrape the material to make themselves\r\na frock. The stuff they use is the pith of the little stalks,\r\nespecially of the pieces that are split lengthwise, because the\r\ncontents are more easily taken from these.\r\n\r\nThe manner of beginning the garment is worth noting. The tiny creature\r\nemploys a method as ingenious as any that we could hope to discover.\r\nThe wadding is collected in pellets of infinitesimal size. How are\r\nthese little pellets to be fixed and joined together? The manufacturer\r\nneeds a support, a base; and this support cannot be obtained on the\r\nCaterpillar’s own body. The difficulty is overcome very cleverly. The\r\npellets are gathered together, and by degrees fastened to one another\r\nwith threads of silk—for the Caterpillar, as you know, can spin silk\r\nfrom his own body as the Spider spins her web. In this way a sort of\r\ngarland is formed, with the pellets or particles swinging in a row from\r\nthe same rope. When it is long enough this garland is passed round the\r\nwaist of the little creature, in such a way as to leave its six legs\r\nfree. Then it ties the ends together with a bit of silk, so that it\r\nforms a girdle round the grub’s body.\r\n\r\nThis girdle is the starting-point and support of the whole work. To\r\nlengthen it, and enlarge it into a complete garment, the grub has only\r\nto fix to it the scraps of pith which the mandibles never cease tearing\r\nfrom the case. These scraps or pellets are sometimes placed at the top,\r\nsometimes at the bottom or side, but they are always fixed at the\r\nfore-edge. No device could be better contrived than this garland, first\r\nlaid out flat and then buckled like a belt round the body.\r\n\r\nOnce this start is made the weaving goes on well. Gradually the girdle\r\ngrows into a scarf, a waistcoat, a short jacket, and lastly a sack, and\r\nin a few hours it is complete—a conical hood or cloak of magnificent\r\nwhiteness.\r\n\r\nThanks to his mother’s care the little grub is spared the perils of\r\nroaming about in a state of nakedness. If she did not place her family\r\nin her old case they might have great difficulty in clothing\r\nthemselves, for straws and stalks rich in pith are not found\r\neverywhere. And yet, unless they died of exposure, it appears that\r\nsooner or later they would find some kind of garment, since they seem\r\nready to use any material that comes to hand. I have made many\r\nexperiments with new-born grubs in a glass tube.\r\n\r\nFrom the stalks of a sort of dandelion they scraped, without the least\r\nhesitation, a superb white pith, and made it into a delicious white\r\ncloak, much finer than any they would have obtained from the remains of\r\ntheir mother’s clothes. An even better garment was woven from some pith\r\ntaken from the kitchen-broom. This time the work glittered with little\r\nsparks, like specks of crystal or grains of sugar. It was my\r\nmanufacturers’ masterpiece.\r\n\r\nThe next material I offered them was a piece of blotting-paper. Here\r\nagain my grubs did not hesitate: they lustily scraped the surface and\r\nmade themselves a paper coat. Indeed, they were so much pleased with\r\nthis that when I gave them their native case they scorned it,\r\npreferring the blotting-paper.\r\n\r\nTo others I gave nothing at all. Not to be baffled, however, they\r\nhastened to scrape the cork of the tube and break it into atoms. Out of\r\nthese they made themselves a frock of cork-grains, as faultless as\r\nthough they and their ancestors had always made use of this material.\r\nThe novelty of the stuff, which perhaps no Caterpillar had ever used\r\nbefore, made no difference in the cut of the garment.\r\n\r\nFinding them ready to accept any vegetable matter that was dry and\r\nlight, I next tried them with animal and mineral substances. I cut a\r\nstrip from the wing of a Great Peacock Moth, and placed two little\r\nnaked Caterpillars upon it. For a long time they both hesitated. Then\r\none of them resolved to use the strange carpet. Before the day was over\r\nhe had clothed himself in grey velvet made of the Great Peacock’s\r\nscales.\r\n\r\nI next took some soft, flaky stones, such as will break at the merest\r\ntouch into atoms nearly as fine as the dust on a Butterfly’s wing. On a\r\nbed of this powdery stuff, which glittered like steel filings, I placed\r\nfour Caterpillars in need of clothes. One, and one alone, decided to\r\ndress himself. His metallic garment, from which the light drew flashes\r\nof every colour of the rainbow, was very rich and sumptuous, but\r\nmightily heavy and cumbrous. Walking became laborious under that load\r\nof metal. Even so must a Byzantine Emperor have walked at ceremonies of\r\nState.\r\n\r\nIn cases of necessity, then, the young Caterpillar does not shrink from\r\nacts of sheer madness. So urgent is his need to clothe himself that he\r\nwill weave mineral matter rather than go naked. Food means less to him\r\nthan clothes. If I make him fast for a couple of days, and then, having\r\nrobbed him of his garment, place him on his favourite food, a leaf of\r\nvery hairy hawkweed, he will make himself a new coat before satisfying\r\nhis hunger.\r\n\r\nThis devotion to dress is due, not to any special sensitiveness to\r\ncold, but to the young Caterpillar’s foresight. Other Caterpillars take\r\nshelter among the leaves, in underground cells, or in the cracked bark\r\nof trees, but the Psyche spends his winter exposed to the weather. He\r\ntherefore prepares himself, from his birth, for the perils of the cold\r\nseason.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he is threatened with the rains of autumn he begins to work\r\nupon his outer case. It is very rough at first. Straws of uneven length\r\nand bits of dry leaves are fastened, with no attempt at order, behind\r\nthe neck of the sack or undergarment, which must remain flexible so as\r\nto allow the Caterpillar to bend freely in every direction. These\r\nuntidy first logs of the outer case will not interfere with the final\r\nregularity of the building: they will be pushed back and driven out as\r\nthe sack grows longer in front.\r\n\r\nAfter a time the pieces are longer and more carefully chosen, and are\r\nall laid on lengthwise. The placing of a straw is done with surprising\r\nspeed and skill. The Caterpillar turns it round and round between his\r\nlegs, and then, gripping it in his mandibles, removes a few morsels\r\nfrom one end, and immediately fixes them to the end of the sack. He\r\nprobably does this in order that the silk may obtain a firmer hold, as\r\na plumber gives a touch of the file to a point that is to be soldered.\r\n\r\nThen, by sheer strength of jaw, he lifts and brandishes his straw in\r\nthe air before laying it on his back. At once the spinneret sets to\r\nwork and fixes it in place. Without any groping about or correcting,\r\nthe thing is done. By the time the cold weather arrives the warm case\r\nis complete.\r\n\r\nBut the silky felt of the interior is never thick enough to please the\r\nCaterpillar. When spring comes he spends all his spare time in\r\nimproving his quilt, in making it ever thicker and softer. Even if I\r\ntake off his outer case he refuses to rebuild it: he persists in adding\r\nnew layers to the lining, even when there is nothing to be lined. The\r\nsack is lamentably flabby; it sags and rumples. He has no protection\r\nnor shelter. No matter. The hour for carpentry has passed. The hour has\r\ncome for upholstering; and he upholsters obstinately, padding a\r\nhouse—or lining a garment—that no longer exists. He will perish\r\nmiserably, cut up by the Ants, as the result of his too-rigid instinct.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTHE SELF-DENIAL OF THE SPANISH COPRIS\r\n\r\n\r\nYou remember, I hope, the Sacred Beetle, who spends her time in making\r\nballs, both to serve as food and also to be the foundation of her\r\npear-shaped nest. I pointed out the advantages of this shape for the\r\nyoung Beetles, since the globe is the best form that could be invented\r\nto keep their provisions from becoming dry and hard.\r\n\r\nAfter watching this Beetle at work for a long time I began to wonder if\r\nI had not perhaps been mistaken in admiring her instinct so greatly.\r\nWas it really care for her grubs, I asked myself, that taught her to\r\nprovide them with the tenderest and most suitable food? It is the trade\r\nof the Sacred Beetle to make balls. Is it wonderful that she should\r\ncontinue her ball-making underground? A creature built with long curved\r\nlegs, very useful for rolling balls across the fields, will go on with\r\nher favourite occupation wherever she may be, without regard to her\r\ngrubs. Perhaps the shape of the pear is mere chance.\r\n\r\nTo settle this question satisfactorily in my own mind I should need to\r\nbe shown a Scavenger Beetle who was utterly unfamiliar with the\r\nball-making business in everyday life, and who yet, when laying-time\r\nwas at hand, made an abrupt change in her habits and stored her\r\nprovisions in the form of a round lump. That would show me that it was\r\nnot merely custom, but care for her grubs, that made her choose the\r\nglobular shape for her nest.\r\n\r\nNow in my neighbourhood there is a Beetle of this very kind. She is one\r\nof the handsomest and largest, though not so imposing as the Sacred\r\nBeetle. Her name is the Spanish Copris, and she is remarkable for the\r\nsharp slope of her chest and the size of the horn surmounting her head.\r\n\r\nBeing round and squat, the Spanish Copris is certainly incapable of\r\nsuch gymnastics as are performed by the Sacred Beetle. Her legs, which\r\nare insignificant in length, and which she folds under her body at the\r\nslightest alarm, are not in the least like the stilts of the\r\npill-rollers. Their stunted form and their lack of flexibility are\r\nenough in themselves to tell us that their owner would not care to roam\r\nabout burdened with a rolling ball.\r\n\r\nThe Copris, indeed, is not of an active nature. Once she has found her\r\nprovisions, at night or in the evening twilight, she begins to dig a\r\nburrow on the spot. It is a rough cavern, large enough to hold an\r\napple. Here is introduced, bit by bit, the stuff that is just overhead,\r\nor at any rate lying on the threshold of the cave. An enormous supply\r\nof food is stored in a shapeless mass, plain evidence of the insect’s\r\ngluttony. As long as the hoard lasts the Copris remains underground.\r\nWhen the larder is empty the insect searches out a fresh supply of\r\nfood, and scoops out another burrow.\r\n\r\nFor the time being the Copris is merely a scavenger, a gatherer of\r\nmanure. She is evidently quite ignorant, at present, of the art of\r\nkneading and modelling a round loaf. Besides, her short clumsy legs\r\nseem utterly unsuited for any such art.\r\n\r\nIn May or June, however, comes laying-time. The insect becomes very\r\nparticular about choosing the softest materials for her family’s food.\r\nHaving found what pleases her, she buries it on the spot, carrying it\r\ndown by armfuls, bit by bit. There is no travelling, no carting, no\r\npreparation. I observe, too, that the burrow is larger and better built\r\nthan the temporary abodes in which the Copris takes her own meals.\r\n\r\nFinding it difficult to observe the insect closely in its wild state, I\r\nresolved to place it in my insect-house, and there watch it at my ease.\r\n\r\nThe poor creature was at first a little nervous in captivity, and when\r\nshe had made her burrow was very cautious about entering it. By\r\ndegrees, however, she was reassured, and in a single night she stored a\r\nsupply of the food I had provided for her.\r\n\r\nBefore a week was out I dug up the soil in my insect-house, and brought\r\nto light the burrow I had seen her storing with provisions. It was a\r\nspacious hall, with an irregular roof and an almost level floor. In a\r\ncorner was a round hole leading to a slanting gallery, which ran up to\r\nthe surface of the soil. The walls of this dwelling, which was hollowed\r\nout of fresh earth, had been carefully compressed, and were strong\r\nenough to resist the earthquake caused by my experiments. It was easy\r\nto see that the insect had put forth all her skill, all her\r\ndigging-powers, in the making of this permanent home, whereas her own\r\ndining-room had been a mere cave, with walls that were none too safe.\r\n\r\nI suspect she is helped, in the building of this architectural\r\nmasterpiece, by her mate: at least I often see him with her in the\r\nburrows. I also believe that he lends his partner a hand with the\r\ncollecting and storing of the provisions. It is a quicker job when\r\nthere are two to work. But once the home is well stocked he retires: he\r\nmakes his way back to the surface and settles down elsewhere. His part\r\nin the family mansion is ended.\r\n\r\nNow what do I find in this mansion, into which I have seen so many tiny\r\nloads of provisions lowered? A mass of small pieces, heaped together\r\nanyhow? Not a bit of it. I always find a simple lump, a huge mass which\r\nfills the dwelling except for a narrow passage.\r\n\r\nThis lump has no fixed shape. I come across some that are like a\r\nTurkey’s egg in form and size; some the shape of a common onion; I find\r\nsome that are almost round, and remind me of a Dutch cheese; I see some\r\nthat are circular, with a slight swelling on the upper surface. In\r\nevery case the surface is smooth and nicely curved.\r\n\r\nThere is no mistaking what has happened. The mother has collected and\r\nkneaded into one lump the numerous fragments brought down one after the\r\nother. Out of all those particles she has made a single lump, by\r\nmashing them, working them together, and treading on them. Time after\r\ntime I have seen her on top of the colossal loaf which is so much\r\nlarger than the ball of the Sacred Beetle—a mere pill in comparison.\r\nShe strolls about on the convex surface, which sometimes measures as\r\nmuch as four inches across; she pats the mass, and makes it firm and\r\nlevel. I only catch a sight of the curious scene, for the moment she\r\nsees me she slips down the curved slope and hides away.\r\n\r\nWith the help of a row of glass jars, all enclosed in opaque sheaths of\r\ncardboard, I can find out a good many interesting things. In the first\r\nplace I have found that the big loaf does not owe its curve—which is\r\nalways regular, no matter how much the slope may vary—to any rolling\r\nprocess. Indeed I already knew that so large a mess could not have been\r\nrolled into a hole that it nearly fills. Besides, the strength of the\r\ninsect would be unequal to moving so great a load.\r\n\r\nEvery time I go to the jar the evidence is the same. I always see the\r\nmother Beetle twisted on top of the lump, feeling here and feeling\r\nthere, giving little taps, and making the thing smooth. Never do I\r\ncatch her looking as if she wanted to turn the block. It is clear as\r\ndaylight that rolling has nothing to do with the matter.\r\n\r\nAt last it is ready. The baker divides his lump of dough into smaller\r\nlumps, each of which will become a loaf. The Copris does the same\r\nthing. By making a circular cut with the sharp edge of her forehead,\r\nand at the same time using the saw of her fore-legs, she detaches from\r\nthe mass a piece of the size she requires. In giving this stroke she\r\nhas no hesitation: there are no after-touches, adding a bit here and\r\ntaking off a bit there. Straight away, with one sharp, decisive cut,\r\nshe obtains the proper-sized lump.\r\n\r\nNext comes the question of shaping it. Clasping it as best she can in\r\nher short arms, so little adapted, one would think, for work of this\r\nkind, the Copris rounds her lump of food by pressure, and pressure\r\nonly. Solemnly she moves about on the still shapeless mass, climbs up,\r\nclimbs down, turns to right and left, above and below, touching and\r\nre-touching with unvarying patience. Finally, after twenty-four hours\r\nof this work, the piece that was all corners has become a perfect\r\nsphere, the size of a plum. There in her cramped studio, with scarcely\r\nroom to move, the podgy artist has completed her work without once\r\nshaking it on its base: by dint of time and patience she has obtained\r\nthe exact sphere which her clumsy tools and her confined space seemed\r\nto render impossible.\r\n\r\nFor a long time she continues to polish up the globe with affectionate\r\ntouches of her foot, but at last she is satisfied. She climbs to the\r\ntop, and by simple pressure hollows out a shallow cavity. In this basin\r\nshe lays an egg.\r\n\r\nThen, with extreme caution and delicacy, she brings together the sides\r\nof the basin so as to cover the egg, and carefully scrapes the sides\r\ntowards the top, which begins to taper a little and lengthen out. In\r\nthe end the ball has become ovoid, or egg-shaped.\r\n\r\nThe insect next helps herself to a second piece of the cut loaf, which\r\nshe treats in the same way. The remainder serves for a third ovoid, or\r\neven a fourth. The Sacred Beetle, you remember, made a single\r\npear-shaped nest in a way that was familiar to her, and then left her\r\negg underground while she engaged in fresh enterprises. The Copris\r\nbehaves very differently.\r\n\r\nHer burrow is almost filled by three or four ovoid nests, standing one\r\nagainst the other, with the pointed end upwards. After her long fast\r\none would expect her to go away, like the Sacred Beetle, in search of\r\nfood. On the contrary, however, she stays where she is. And yet she has\r\neaten nothing since she came underground, for she has taken good care\r\nnot to touch the food prepared for her family. She will go hungry\r\nrather than let her grubs suffer.\r\n\r\nHer object in staying is to mount guard over the cradles. The pear of\r\nthe Sacred Beetle suffers from the mother’s desertion. It soon shows\r\ncracks, and becomes scaly and swollen. After a time it loses its shape.\r\nBut the nest of the Copris remains perfect, owing to the mother’s care.\r\nShe goes from one to the other, feels them, listens to them, and\r\ntouches them up at points where my eye can detect no flaw. Her clumsy\r\nhorn-shod foot is more sensitive in the darkness than my sight in broad\r\ndaylight: she feels the least threatening of a crack and attends to it\r\nat once, lest the air should enter and dry up her eggs. She slips in\r\nand out of the narrow spaces between the cradles, inspecting them with\r\nthe utmost care. If I disturb her she sometimes rubs the tip of her\r\nbody against the edge of her wing-cases, making a soft rustling sound,\r\nlike a murmur of complaint. In this way, caring industriously for her\r\ncradles, and sometimes snatching a brief sleep beside them the mother\r\nwaits.\r\n\r\nThe Copris enjoys in her underground home a rare privilege for an\r\ninsect: the pleasure of knowing her family. She hears her grubs\r\nscratching at the shell to obtain their liberty; she is present at the\r\nbursting of the nest which she has made so carefully. And when the\r\nlittle captive, stiffening his legs and humping his back, tries to\r\nsplit the ceiling that presses down on him, it is quite possible that\r\nthe mother comes to his assistance by making an assault on the nest\r\nfrom the outside. Being fitted by instinct for repairing and building,\r\nwhy should she not also be fitted for demolishing? However, I will make\r\nno assertions, for I have been unable to see.\r\n\r\nNow it is possible to say that the mother Copris, being imprisoned in\r\nan enclosure from which she cannot escape, stays in the midst of her\r\nnest because she has no choice in the matter. Yet, if this were so,\r\nwould she trouble about her work of polishing and constant inspection?\r\nThese cares evidently are natural to her: they form part of her habits.\r\nIf she were anxious to regain her liberty, she would surely roam\r\nrestlessly round the enclosure, whereas I always see her very quiet and\r\nabsorbed.\r\n\r\nTo make certain, I have inspected my glass jars at different times. She\r\ncould go lower down in the sand and hide anywhere she pleased, if rest\r\nwere what she wanted; she could climb outside and sit down to fresh\r\nfood, if refreshment became necessary. Neither the prospect of rest in\r\na deeper cave nor the thought of the sun and of food makes her leave\r\nher family. Until the last of them has burst his shell she sticks to\r\nher post. I always find her beside her cradles.\r\n\r\nFor four months she is without food of any kind. She was no better than\r\na glutton at first, when there was no family to consider, but now she\r\nbecomes self-denying to the point of prolonged fasting. The Hen sitting\r\non her eggs forgets to eat for some weeks; the watchful Copris mother\r\nforgets food for a third part of the year.\r\n\r\nThe summer is over. The rains so greatly desired by man and beast have\r\ncome at last, soaking the ground to some depth. After the torrid and\r\ndusty days of our Provençal summer, when life is in suspense, we have\r\nthe coolness that revives it. The heath puts out its first pink bells;\r\nthe autumnal squill lifts its little spike of lilac flowers; the\r\nstrawberry-tree’s coral bells begin to soften; the Sacred Beetle and\r\nthe Copris burst their shells, and come to the surface in time to enjoy\r\nthe last fine weather of the year.\r\n\r\nThe newly released Copris family, accompanied by their mother,\r\ngradually emerge from underground. There are three or four of them,\r\nfive at most. The sons are easily recognised by the greater length of\r\ntheir horns; but there is nothing to distinguish the daughters from the\r\nmother. For that matter, the same confusion exists among themselves. An\r\nabrupt change has taken place. The mother whose devotion was lately so\r\nremarkable is now utterly indifferent to the welfare of her family.\r\nHenceforward each looks after his own home and his own interests. They\r\nno longer have anything to do with one another.\r\n\r\nThe present indifference of the mother Beetle must not make us forget\r\nthe wonderful care she has lavished for four months on end. Except\r\namong the Bees, Wasps, and Ants, who spoon-feed their young and bring\r\nthem up with every attention to their health, I know of no other such\r\ncase of maternal self-denial. Alone and unaided she provides each of\r\nher children with a cake of food, whose crust she constantly repairs,\r\nso that it becomes the safest of cradles. So intense is her affection\r\nthat she loses all desire and need of food. In the darkness of the\r\nburrow she watches over her brood for four months, attending to the\r\nwants of the egg, the grub, the undeveloped Beetle, and the full-grown\r\ninsect. She does not return to the glad outer life till all her family\r\nare free. Thus we see one of the most brilliant examples of maternal\r\ninstinct in a humble scavenger of the fields. The Spirit breatheth\r\nwhere He will.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nTWO STRANGE GRASSHOPPERS\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nTHE EMPUSA\r\n\r\nThe sea, where life first appeared, still preserves in its depths many\r\nof those curious shapes which were the earliest specimens of the animal\r\nkingdom. But the land has almost entirely lost the strange forms of\r\nother days. The few that remain are mostly insects. One of these is the\r\nPraying Mantis, whose remarkable shape and habits I have already\r\ndescribed to you. Another is the Empusa.\r\n\r\nThis insect, in its undeveloped or larval state, is certainly the\r\nstrangest creature in all Provence: a slim, swaying thing of so\r\nfantastic an appearance that unaccustomed fingers dare not lay hold of\r\nit. The children of my neighbourhood are so much impressed by its\r\nstartling shape that they call it “the Devilkin.” They imagine it to be\r\nin some way connected with witchcraft. One comes across it, though\r\nnever in great numbers, in the spring up to May; in autumn; and\r\nsometimes in winter if the sun be strong. The tough grasses of the\r\nwaste-lands, the stunted bushes which catch the sunshine and are\r\nsheltered from the wind by a few heaps of stones, are the chilly\r\nEmpusa’s favourite dwelling.\r\n\r\nI will tell you, as well as I can, what she looks like. The tail-end of\r\nher body is always twisted and curved up over her back so as to form a\r\ncrook, and the lower surface of her body (that is to say, of course,\r\nthe upper surface of the crook) is covered with pointed, leaf-shaped\r\nscales, arranged in three rows. The crook is propped on four long, thin\r\nlegs, like stilts; and on each of these legs, at the point where the\r\nthigh joins the shin, is a curved, projecting blade not unlike that of\r\na cleaver.\r\n\r\nIn front of this crook on stilts, this four-legged stool, there rises\r\nsuddenly—very long and almost perpendicular—the stiff corselet or bust.\r\nIt is round and slender as a straw, and at the end of it is the\r\nhunting-trap, copied from that of the Mantis. This consists of a\r\nharpoon sharper than a needle, and a cruel vice with jaws toothed like\r\na saw. The jaw, or blade formed by the upper arm, is hollowed into a\r\ngroove and carries five long spikes on each side, with smaller\r\nindentations in between. The jaw formed by the fore-arm is grooved in\r\nthe same way, but the teeth are finer, closer, and more regular. When\r\nat rest, the saw of the fore-arm fits into the groove of the upper arm.\r\nIf the machine were only larger it would be a fearful instrument of\r\ntorture.\r\n\r\nThe head is in keeping with this arsenal. What a queer head it is! A\r\npointed face, with curled moustaches; large goggle eyes; between them\r\nthe blade of a dirk; and on the forehead a mad, unheard-of thing—a sort\r\nof tall mitre, an extravagant head-dress that juts forward, spreading\r\nright and left into peaked wings. What does the Devilkin want with that\r\nmonstrous pointed cap, as magnificent as any ever worn by astrologer of\r\nold? The use of it will appear presently.\r\n\r\nThe creature’s colouring at this time is commonplace—chiefly grey. As\r\nit develops it becomes faintly striped with pale green, white, and\r\npink.\r\n\r\nIf you come across this fantastic object in the bramble-bushes, it\r\nsways upon its four stilts, it wags its head at you knowingly, it\r\ntwists its mitre round and peers over its shoulder. You seem to see\r\nmischief in its pointed face. But if you try to take hold of it this\r\nthreatening attitude disappears at once; the raised corselet is\r\nlowered, and the creature makes off with mighty strides, helping itself\r\nalong with its weapons, with which it clutches the twigs. If you have a\r\npracticed eye, however, the Empusa is easily caught, and penned in a\r\ncage of wire-gauze.\r\n\r\nAt first I was uncertain how to feed them. My Devilkins were very\r\nlittle, a month or two old at most. I gave them Locusts suited to their\r\nsize, the smallest I could find. They not only refused them, but were\r\nafraid of them. Any thoughtless Locust that meekly approached an Empusa\r\nmet with a bad reception. The pointed mitre was lowered, and an angry\r\nthrust sent the Locust rolling. The wizard’s cap, then, is a defensive\r\nweapon. As the Ram charges with his forehead, so the Empusa butts with\r\nher mitre.\r\n\r\nI next offered her a live House-fly, and this time the dinner was\r\naccepted at once. The moment the Fly came within reach the watchful\r\nDevilkin turned her head, bent her corselet slantwise, harpooned the\r\nFly, and gripped it between her two saws. No Cat could pounce more\r\nquickly on a Mouse.\r\n\r\nTo my surprise I found that the Fly was not only enough for a meal, but\r\nenough for the whole day, and often for several days. These\r\nfierce-looking insects are extremely abstemious. I was expecting them\r\nto be ogres, and found them with the delicate appetites of invalids.\r\nAfter a time even a Midge failed to tempt them, and through the winter\r\nmonths they fasted altogether. When the spring came, however, they were\r\nready to indulge in a small piece of Cabbage Butterfly or Locust;\r\nattacking their prey invariably in the neck, like the Mantis.\r\n\r\nThe young Empusa has one very curious habit when in captivity. In its\r\ncage of wire-gauze its attitude is the same from first to last, and a\r\nmost strange attitude it is. It grips the wire by the claws of its four\r\nhind-legs, and hangs motionless, back downwards, with the whole of its\r\nbody suspended from those four points. If it wishes to move, its\r\nharpoons open in front, stretch out, grasp a mesh of the wire, and\r\npull. This process naturally draws the insect along the wire, still\r\nupside down. Then the jaws close back against the chest.\r\n\r\nAnd this upside-down position, which seems to us so trying, lasts for\r\nno short while. It continues, in my cages, for ten months without a\r\nbreak. The Fly on the ceiling, it is true, adopts the same position;\r\nbut she has her moments of rest. She flies, she walks in the usual way,\r\nshe spreads herself flat in the sun. The Empusa, on the other hand,\r\nremains in her curious attitude for ten months on end, without a pause.\r\nHanging from the wire netting, back downwards, she hunts, eats,\r\ndigests, dozes, gets through all the experiences of an insect’s life,\r\nand finally dies. She clambers up while she is still quite young; she\r\nfalls down in her old age, a corpse.\r\n\r\nThis custom is all the more remarkable in that it is practised only in\r\ncaptivity. It is not an instinctive habit of the race; for out of doors\r\nthe insect, except at rare intervals, stands on the bushes back\r\nupwards.\r\n\r\nStrange as the performance is, I know of a similar case that is even\r\nmore peculiar: the attitude of certain Wasps and Bees during the\r\nnight’s rest. A particular Wasp, an Ammophila with red fore-legs, is\r\nplentiful in my enclosure towards the end of August, and likes to sleep\r\nin one of the lavender borders. At dusk, especially after a stifling\r\nday when a storm is brewing, I am sure to find the strange sleeper\r\nsettled there. Never was a more eccentric attitude chosen for a night’s\r\nrest. The jaws bite right into the lavender-stem. Its square shape\r\nsupplies a firmer hold than a round stalk would give. With this one and\r\nonly prop the Wasp’s body juts out stiffly at full length, with legs\r\nfolded. It forms a right angle with the stalk, so that the whole weight\r\nof the insect rests upon the mandibles.\r\n\r\nThe Ammophila is enabled by its mighty jaws to sleep in this way,\r\nextended in space. It takes an animal to think of a thing like that,\r\nwhich upsets all our previous ideas of rest. Should the threatening\r\nstorm burst and the stalk sway in the wind, the sleeper is not troubled\r\nby her swinging hammock; at most, she presses her fore-legs for a\r\nmoment against the tossing stem. Perhaps the Wasp’s jaws, like the\r\nBird’s toes, possess the power of gripping more tightly in proportion\r\nto the violence of the wind. However that may be, there are several\r\nkinds of Wasps and Bees who adopt this strange position,—gripping a\r\nstalk with their mandibles, and sleeping with their bodies outstretched\r\nand their legs folded back. This state of things makes us wonder what\r\nit is that really constitutes rest.\r\n\r\nAbout the middle of May the Empusa is transformed into her full-grown\r\ncondition. She is even more remarkable in figure and attire than the\r\nPraying Mantis. She still keeps some of her youthful eccentricities—the\r\nbust, the weapons on her knees, and the three rows of scales on the\r\nlower surface of her body. But she is now no longer twisted into a\r\ncrook, and is comelier to look upon. Large pale-green wings, pink at\r\nthe shoulder and swift in flight, cover the white and green stripes\r\nthat ornament the body below. The male Empusa, who is a dandy, adorns\r\nhimself, like some of the Moths, with feathery antennæ.\r\n\r\nWhen, in the spring, the peasant meets the Empusa, he thinks he sees\r\nthe common Praying Mantis, who is a daughter of the autumn. They are so\r\nmuch alike that one would expect them to have the same habits. In fact,\r\nany one might be tempted, led away by the extraordinary armour, to\r\nsuspect the Empusa of a mode of life even more atrocious than that of\r\nthe Mantis. This would be a mistake: for all their war-like aspect the\r\nEmpusæ are peaceful creatures.\r\n\r\nImprisoned in their wire-gauze bell-jar, either in groups of half a\r\ndozen or in separate couples, they at no time lose their placidity.\r\nEven in their full-grown state they are very small eaters, and content\r\nthemselves with a fly or two as their daily ration.\r\n\r\nBig eaters are naturally quarrelsome. The Mantis, gorged with Locusts,\r\nsoon becomes irritated and shows fight. The Empusa, with her frugal\r\nmeals, is a lover of peace. She indulges in no quarrels with her\r\nneighbours, nor does she pretend to be a ghost, with a view to\r\nfrightening them, after the manner of the Mantis. She never unfurls her\r\nwings suddenly nor puffs like a startled Adder. She has never the least\r\ninclination for the cannibal banquets at which a sister, after being\r\nworsted in a fight, is eaten up. Nor does she, like the Mantis, devour\r\nher husband. Such atrocities are here unknown.\r\n\r\nThe organs of the two insects are the same. These profound moral\r\ndifferences, therefore, are not due to any difference in the bodily\r\nform. Possibly they may arise from the difference in food. Simple\r\nliving, as a matter of fact, softens character, in animals as in men;\r\nover-feeding brutalises it. The glutton, gorged with meat and strong\r\ndrink—a very common cause of savage outbursts—could never be as gentle\r\nas the self-denying hermit who lives on bread dipped into a cup of\r\nmilk. The Mantis is a glutton: the Empusa lives the simple life.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, even when this is granted, one is forced to ask a further\r\nquestion. Why, when the two insects are almost exactly the same in\r\nform, and might be expected to have the same needs, should the one have\r\nan enormous appetite and the other such temperate ways? They tell us,\r\nin their own fashion, what many insects have told us already: that\r\ninclinations and habits do not depend entirely upon anatomy. High above\r\nthe laws that govern matter rise other laws that govern instincts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nTHE WHITE-FACED DECTICUS\r\n\r\nThe White-faced Decticus stands at the head of the Grasshopper clan in\r\nmy district, both as a singer and as an insect of imposing presence. He\r\nhas a grey body, a pair of powerful mandibles, and a broad ivory face.\r\nWithout being plentiful, he is neither difficult nor wearisome to hunt.\r\nIn the height of summer we find him hopping in the long grass,\r\nespecially at the foot of the sunny rocks where the turpentine-tree\r\ntakes root.\r\n\r\nThe Greek word dectikos means biting, fond of biting. The Decticus is\r\nwell named. It is eminently an insect given to biting. Mind your finger\r\nif this sturdy Grasshopper gets hold of it: he will rip it till the\r\nblood comes. His powerful jaw, of which I have to beware when I handle\r\nhim, and the large muscles that swell out his cheeks, are evidently\r\nintended for cutting up leathery prey.\r\n\r\nI find, when the Decticus is imprisoned in my menagerie, that any fresh\r\nmeat tasting of Locust or Grasshopper suits his needs. The blue-winged\r\nLocust is the most frequent victim. As soon as the food is introduced\r\ninto the cage there is an uproar, especially if the Dectici are hungry.\r\nThey stamp about, and dart forward clumsily, being hampered by their\r\nlong shanks. Some of the Locusts are caught at once, but others with\r\ndesperate bounds rush to the top of the cage, and there hang on out of\r\nthe reach of the Grasshopper, who is too stout to climb so high. But\r\nthey have only postponed their fate. Either because they are tired, or\r\nbecause they are tempted by the green stuff below, they will come down,\r\nand the Dectici will be after them immediately.\r\n\r\nThis Grasshopper, though his intellect is dull, possesses the art of\r\nscientific killing of which we have seen instances elsewhere. He always\r\nspears his prey in the neck, and, to make it helpless as quickly as\r\npossible, begins by biting the nerves that enable it to move. It is a\r\nvery wise method, for the Locust is hard to kill. Even when beheaded he\r\ngoes on hopping. I have seen some who, though half-eaten, kicked out so\r\ndesperately that they succeeded in escaping.\r\n\r\nWith his weakness for Locusts, and also for certain seeds that are\r\nharmful to unripe corn, these Grasshoppers might be of some service to\r\nagriculture if only there were more of them. But nowadays his\r\nassistance in preserving the fruits of the earth is very feeble. His\r\nchief interest in our eyes is the fact that he is a memorial of the\r\nremotest times. He gives us a vague glimpse of habits now out of use.\r\n\r\nIt was thanks to the Decticus that I first learnt one or two things\r\nabout young Grasshoppers.\r\n\r\nInstead of packing their eggs in casks of hardened foam, like the\r\nLocust and the Mantis, or laying them in a twig like the Cicada,\r\nGrasshoppers plant them like seeds in the earth.\r\n\r\nThe mother Decticus has a tool at the end of her body with which she\r\nscrapes out a little hole in the soil. In this hole she lays a certain\r\nnumber of eggs, then loosens the dust round the side of the hole and\r\nrams it down with her tool, very much as we should pack the earth in a\r\nhole with a stick. In this way she covers up the well, and then sweeps\r\nand smooths the ground above it.\r\n\r\nShe then goes for a little walk in the neighbourhood, by way of\r\nrecreation. Soon she comes back to the place where she has already laid\r\nher eggs, and, very near the original spot, which she recognises quite\r\nwell, begins the work afresh. If I watch her for an hour I see her go\r\nthrough this whole performance, including the short stroll in the\r\nneighbourhood, no less than five times. The points where she lays the\r\neggs are always very close together.\r\n\r\nWhen everything is finished I examine the little pits. The eggs lie\r\nsingly, without any cell or sheath to protect them. There are about\r\nsixty of them altogether, pale lilac-grey in colour, and shaped like a\r\nshuttle.\r\n\r\nWhen I began to observe the ways of the Decticus I was anxious to watch\r\nthe hatching, so at the end of August I gathered plenty of eggs, and\r\nplaced them in a small glass jar with a layer of sand. Without\r\nsuffering any apparent change they spent eight months there under\r\ncover, sheltered from the frosts, the showers, and the overpowering\r\nheat of the sun, which they would be obliged to endure out of doors.\r\n\r\nWhen June came, the eggs in my jar showed no sign of being about to\r\nhatch. They were just as I had gathered them nine months before,\r\nneither wrinkled nor tarnished, but on the contrary wearing a most\r\nhealthy look. Yet in June young Dectici are often to be met in the\r\nfields, and sometimes even those of larger growth. What was the reason\r\nof this delay, I wondered.\r\n\r\nThen an idea came to me. The eggs of the Grasshopper are planted like\r\nseeds in the earth, where they are exposed, without any protection, to\r\nsnow and rain. Those in my jar had spent two-thirds of the year in a\r\nstate of comparative dryness. Since they were sown like seeds, perhaps\r\nthey needed, to make them hatch, the moisture that seeds require to\r\nmake them sprout. I resolved to try.\r\n\r\nI placed at the bottom of some glass tubes a pinch of backward eggs\r\ntaken from my collection, and on the top I heaped lightly a layer of\r\nfine, damp sand. I closed the tubes with plugs of wet cotton, to keep\r\nthe air in them constantly moist. Any one seeing my preparations would\r\nhave supposed me to be a botanist experimenting with seeds.\r\n\r\nMy hopes were fulfilled. In the warmth and moisture the eggs soon\r\nshowed signs of hatching. They began to swell, and the bursting of the\r\nshell was evidently close at hand. I spent a fortnight in keeping a\r\ntedious watch at every hour of the day, for I had to surprise the young\r\nDecticus actually leaving the egg, in order to solve a question that\r\nhad long been in my mind.\r\n\r\nThe question was this. The Grasshopper is buried, as a rule, about an\r\ninch below the surface of the soil. Now the new-born Decticus, hopping\r\nawkwardly in the grass at the approach of summer, has, like the\r\nfull-grown insect, a pair of very long tentacles, as slender as hairs;\r\nwhile he carries behind him two extraordinary legs, two enormous hinged\r\njumping-poles that would be very inconvenient for ordinary walking. I\r\nwished to find out how the feeble little creature set to work, with\r\nthis cumbrous luggage, to make its way to the surface of the earth. By\r\nwhat means could it clear a passage through the rough soil? With its\r\nfeathery antennæ, which an atom of sand can break, and its immense\r\nshanks, which are disjointed by the least effort, this mite is plainly\r\nincapable of freeing itself.\r\n\r\nAs I have already told you, the Cicada and the Praying Mantis, when\r\nissuing, the one from his twig, and the other from his nest, wear a\r\nprotective covering like an overall. It seemed to me that the little\r\nGrasshopper, too, must come out through the sand in a simpler, more\r\ncompact form than he wears when he hops about the lawn on the day after\r\nhis birth.\r\n\r\nNor was I mistaken. The Decticus, like the others, wears an overall for\r\nthe occasion. The tiny, flesh-white creature is cased in a scabbard\r\nwhich keeps the six legs flattened against the body, stretching\r\nbackwards, inert. In order to slip more easily through the soil his\r\nshanks are tied up beside him; while the antennæ, those other\r\ninconvenient appendages, are pressed motionless against the parcel.\r\n\r\nThe head is very much bent against the chest. With the big black specks\r\nthat are going to be its eyes, and its inexpressive, rather swollen\r\nmask, it suggests a diver’s helmet. The neck opens wide at the back,\r\nand, with a slow throbbing, by turns swells and sinks. It is by means\r\nof this throbbing protrusion through the opening at the back of the\r\nhead that the new-born insect moves. When the lump is flat, the head\r\npushes back the damp sand a little way and slips into it by digging a\r\ntiny pit. Then the swelling is blown out and becomes a knob which\r\nsticks firmly in the hole. This supplies the resistance necessary for\r\nthe grub to draw up its back and push. Thus a step forward is made.\r\nEach thrust of the motor-blister helps the little Decticus upon the\r\nupward path.\r\n\r\nIt is pitiful to see this tender creature, still almost colourless,\r\nknocking with its swollen neck and ramming the rough soil. With flesh\r\nthat is not yet hardened it is painfully fighting stone; and fighting\r\nit so successfully that in the space of a morning it makes a gallery,\r\neither straight or winding, an inch long and as wide as an average\r\nstraw. In this way the harassed insect reaches the surface.\r\n\r\nBefore it is altogether freed from the soil the struggler halts for a\r\nmoment, to recover from the effects of the journey. Then, with renewed\r\nstrength, it makes a last effort: it swells the protrusion at the back\r\nof its head as far as it will go, and bursts the sheath that has\r\nprotected it so far. The creature throws off its overall.\r\n\r\nHere, then, is the Decticus in his youthful shape, quite pale still,\r\nbut darker the next day, and a regular blackamoor compared with the\r\nfull-grown insect. As a prelude to the ivory face of his riper age he\r\nwears a narrow white stripe under his hinder thighs.\r\n\r\nLittle Decticus, hatched before my eyes, life opens for you very\r\nharshly! Many of your relatives must die of exhaustion before winning\r\ntheir freedom. In my tubes I see numbers who, being stopped by a grain\r\nof sand, give up the struggle half-way and become furred with a sort of\r\nsilky fluff. Mildew soon absorbs their poor little remains. And when\r\ncarried out without my help, their journey to the surface must be even\r\nmore dangerous, for the soil out of doors is coarse and baked by the\r\nsun.\r\n\r\nThe little white-striped nigger nibbles at the lettuce-leaf I give him,\r\nand leaps about gaily in the cage where I have housed him. I could\r\neasily rear him, but he would not teach me much more. So I restore him\r\nto liberty. In return for what he has taught me I give him the grass\r\nand the Locusts in the garden.\r\n\r\nFor he taught me that Grasshoppers, in order to leave the ground where\r\nthe eggs are laid, wear a temporary form which keeps those too cumbrous\r\nparts, the long legs and antennæ, swathed together in a sheath. He\r\ntaught me, too, that this mummy-like creature, fit only to lengthen and\r\nshorten itself a little, has for its means of travelling a hernia in\r\nthe neck, a throbbing blister—an original piece of mechanism which,\r\nwhen I first observed the Decticus, I had never seen used as an aid to\r\nprogression.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nCOMMON WASPS\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nTHEIR CLEVERNESS AND STUPIDITY\r\n\r\nWishing to observe a Wasp’s nest I go out, one day in September, with\r\nmy little son Paul, who helps me with his good sight and his undivided\r\nattention. We look with interest at the edges of the footpaths.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Paul cries: “A Wasp’s nest! A Wasp’s nest, as sure as\r\nanything!” For, twenty yards away, he has seen rising from the ground,\r\nshooting up and flying away, now one and then another swiftly moving\r\nobject, as though some tiny crater in the grass were hurling them\r\nforth.\r\n\r\nWe approach the spot with caution, fearing to attract the attention of\r\nthe fierce creatures. At the entrance-door of their dwelling, a round\r\nopening large enough to admit a man’s thumb, the inmates come and go,\r\nbusily passing one another as they fly in opposite directions. Burr! A\r\nshudder runs through me at the thought of the unpleasant time we should\r\nhave, did we incite these irritable warriors to attack us by inspecting\r\nthem too closely. Without further investigation, which might cost us\r\ntoo dear, we mark the spot, and resolve to return at nightfall. By that\r\ntime all the inhabitants of the nest will have come home from the\r\nfields.\r\n\r\nThe conquest of a nest of Common Wasps would be rather a serious\r\nundertaking if one did not act with a certain amount of prudence. Half\r\na pint of petrol, a reed-stump nine inches long, and a good-sized lump\r\nof clay or loam, kneaded to the right consistency—such are my weapons,\r\nwhich I have come to consider the best and simplest, after various\r\ntrials with less successful means.\r\n\r\nThe suffocating method is necessary, unless I use costly measures which\r\nI cannot afford. When Réaumur wanted to place a live Wasp’s nest in a\r\nglass case with a view to observing the habits of the inmates, he\r\nemployed helpers who were used to the painful job, and were willing,\r\nfor a handsome reward, to serve the man of science at the cost of their\r\nskins. But I, who should have to pay with my own skin, think twice\r\nbefore digging up the nest I desire. I begin by suffocating the\r\ninhabitants. Dead Wasps do not sting. It is a brutal method, but\r\nperfectly safe.\r\n\r\nI use petrol because its effects are not too violent, and in order to\r\nmake my observations I wish to leave a small number of survivors. The\r\nquestion is how to introduce it into the cavity containing the Wasp’s\r\nnest. A vestibule, or entrance-passage, about nine inches long, and\r\nvery nearly horizontal, leads to the underground cells. To pour the\r\npetrol straight into the mouths of this tunnel would be a blunder that\r\nmight have serious consequences later on. For so small a quantity of\r\npetrol would be absorbed by the soil and would never reach the nest;\r\nand next day, when we might think we were digging safely, we should\r\nfind an infuriated swarm under the spade.\r\n\r\nThe bit of reed prevents this mishap. When inserted into the passage it\r\nforms a water-tight funnel, and carries the petrol to the cavern\r\nwithout the loss of a drop, and as quickly as possible. Then we fix the\r\nlump of kneaded clay into the entrance-hole, like a stopper. We have\r\nnothing to do now but wait.\r\n\r\nWhen we are going to perform this operation Paul and I set out,\r\ncarrying a lantern and a basket with the implements, at nine o’clock on\r\nsome mild, moonlit evening. While the farmhouse Dogs are yelping at\r\neach other in the distance, and the Screech Owl is hooting in the\r\nolive-trees, and the Italian Crickets are performing their symphony in\r\nthe bushes, Paul and I chat about insects. He asks questions, eager to\r\nlearn, and I tell him the little that I know. So delightful are our\r\nnights of Wasp-hunting that we think little of the loss of sleep or the\r\nchance of being stung!\r\n\r\nThe pushing of the reed into the hole is the most delicate matter.\r\nSince the direction of the passage is unknown there is some hesitation,\r\nand sometimes sentries come flying out of the Wasp’s guard-house to\r\nattack the operator’s hand. To prevent this one of us keeps watch, and\r\ndrives away the enemy with a handkerchief. And after all, a swelling on\r\none’s hand, even if it does smart, is not much to pay for an idea.\r\n\r\nAs the petrol streams into the cavern we hear the threatening buzz of\r\nthe population underground. Then quick!—the door must be closed with\r\nthe wet clay, and the clod kicked once or twice with the heel to make\r\nthe stopper solid. There is nothing more to be done for the present.\r\nOff we go to bed.\r\n\r\nWith a spade and a trowel we are back on the spot at dawn. It is wise\r\nto be early, because many Wasps will have been out all night, and will\r\nwant to get into their home while we are digging. The chill of the\r\nmorning will make them less fierce.\r\n\r\nIn front of the entrance-passage, in which the reed is still sticking,\r\nwe dig a trench wide enough to allow us free movement. Then the side of\r\nthis ditch is carefully cut away, slice after slice, until, at a depth\r\nof about twenty inches, the Wasp’s nest is revealed, uninjured, slung\r\nfrom the roof of a spacious cavity.\r\n\r\nIt is indeed a superb achievement, as large as a fair-sized pumpkin. It\r\nhangs free on every side except at the top, where various roots, mostly\r\nof couch-grass, penetrate the thickness of the wall and fasten the nest\r\nfirmly. Its shape is round wherever the ground has been soft, and of\r\nthe same consistency all through. In stony soil, where the Wasps meet\r\nwith obstacles in their digging, the sphere becomes more or less\r\nmisshapen.\r\n\r\nA space of a hand’s-breadth is always left open between the paper nest\r\nand the sides of the underground vault. This space is the wide street\r\nalong which the builders move unhindered at their continual task of\r\nenlarging and strengthening the nest, and the passage that leads to the\r\nouter world opens into it. Underneath the nest is a much larger\r\nunoccupied space, rounded into a big basin, so that the wrapper of the\r\nnest can be enlarged as fresh cells are added. This cavity also serves\r\nas a dust-bin for refuse.\r\n\r\nThe cavity was dug by the Wasps themselves. Of that there is no doubt;\r\nfor holes so large and so regular do not exist ready-made. The original\r\nfoundress of the nest may have seized on some cavity made by a Mole, to\r\nhelp her at the beginning; but the greater part of the enormous vault\r\nwas the work of the Wasps. Yet there is not a scrap of rubbish outside\r\nthe entrance. Where is the mass of earth that has been removed?\r\n\r\nIt has been spread over such a large surface of ground that it is\r\nunnoticed. Thousands and thousands of Wasps work at digging the cellar,\r\nand enlarging it as that becomes necessary. They fly up to the outer\r\nworld, each carrying a particle of earth, which they drop on the ground\r\nat some distance from the nest, in all directions. Being scattered in\r\nthis way the earth leaves no visible trace.\r\n\r\nThe Wasp’s nest is made of a thin, flexible material like brown paper,\r\nformed of particles of wood. It is streaked with bands, of which the\r\ncolour varies according to the wood used. If it were made in a single\r\ncontinuous sheet it would give little protection against the cold. But\r\nthe Common Wasp, like the ballon-maker, knows that heat may be\r\npreserved by means of a cushion of air contained by several wrappers.\r\nSo she makes her paper-pulp into broad scales, which overlap loosely\r\nand are laid on in numerous layers. The whole forms a coarse blanket,\r\nthick and spongy in texture and well filled with stagnant air. The\r\ntemperature under this shelter must be truly tropical in hot weather.\r\n\r\nThe fierce Hornet, chief of the Wasps, builds her nest on the same\r\nprinciple. In the hollow of a willow, or within some empty granary, she\r\nmakes, out of fragments of wood, a very brittle kind of striped yellow\r\ncardboard. Her nest is wrapped round with many layers of this\r\nsubstance, laid on in the form of broad convex scales which are welded\r\nto one another. Between them are wide intervals in which air is held\r\nmotionless.\r\n\r\nThe Wasp, then, often acts in accordance with the laws of physics and\r\ngeometry. She employs air, a non-conductor of heat, to keep her home\r\nwarm; she made blankets before man thought of it; she builds the outer\r\nwalls of the nest in the shape that gives her the largest amount of\r\nroom in the smallest wrapper; and in the form of her cell, too, she\r\neconomises space and material.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, clever as these wonderful architects are, they amaze us by\r\ntheir stupidity in the face of the smallest difficulty. On the one hand\r\ntheir instincts teach them to behave like men of science; but on the\r\nother it is plain that they are entirely without the power of\r\nreflection. I have convinced myself of this fact by various\r\nexperiments.\r\n\r\nThe Common Wasp has chanced to set up house beside one of the walks in\r\nmy enclosure, which enables me to experiment with a bell-glass. In the\r\nopen fields I could not use this appliance, because the boys of the\r\ncountryside would soon smash it. One night, when all was dark and the\r\nWasps had gone home, I placed the glass over the entrance of the\r\nburrow, after first flattening the soil. When the Wasps began work\r\nagain next morning and found themselves checked in their flight, would\r\nthey succeed in making a passage under the rim of the glass? Would\r\nthese sturdy creatures, who were capable of digging a spacious cavern,\r\nrealise that a very short underground tunnel would set them free? That\r\nwas the question.\r\n\r\nThe next morning I found the bright sunlight falling on the bell-glass,\r\nand the workers ascending in crowds from underground, eager to go in\r\nsearch of provisions. They butted against the transparent wall, tumbled\r\ndown, picked themselves up again, and whirled round and round in a\r\ncrazy swarm. Some, weary of dancing, wandered peevishly at random and\r\nthen re-entered their dwelling. Others took their places as the sun\r\ngrew hotter. But not one of them, not a single one, scratched with her\r\nfeet at the base of the glass circle. This means of escape was beyond\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile a few Wasps who had spent the night out of doors were coming\r\nin from the fields. Round and round the bell-glass they flew; and at\r\nlast, after much hesitation, one of them decided to dig under the edge.\r\nOthers followed her example, a passage was easily opened, and the Wasps\r\nwent in. Then I closed the passage with some earth. The narrow opening,\r\nif seen from within, might help the Wasps to escape, and I wished to\r\nleave the prisoners the honour of winning their liberty.\r\n\r\nHowever poor the Wasps’ power of reasoning, I thought their escape was\r\nnow probable. Those who had just entered would surely show the way;\r\nthey would teach the others to dig below the wall of glass.\r\n\r\nI was too hasty. Of learning by experience or example there was not a\r\nsign. Inside the glass not an attempt was made to dig a tunnel. The\r\ninsect population whirled round and round, but showed no enterprise.\r\nThey floundered about, while every day numbers died from famine and\r\nheat. At the end of a week not one was left alive. A heap of corpses\r\ncovered the ground.\r\n\r\nThe Wasps returning from the field could find their way in, because the\r\npower of scenting their house through the soil, and searching for it,\r\nis one of their natural instincts, one of the means of defence given to\r\nthem. There is no need for thought or reasoning here: the earthy\r\nobstacle has been familiar to every Wasp since Wasps first came into\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\nBut those who are within the bell-glass have no such instinct to help\r\nthem. Their aim is to get into the light, and finding daylight in their\r\ntransparent prison they think their aim is accomplished. In spite of\r\nconstant collisions with the glass they spend themselves in vainly\r\ntrying to fly farther in the direction of the sunshine. There is\r\nnothing in the past to teach them what to do. They keep blindly to\r\ntheir familiar habits, and die.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nSOME OF THEIR HABITS\r\n\r\nIf we open the thick envelope of the nest we shall find, inside, a\r\nnumber of combs, or layers of cells, lying one below the other and\r\nfastened together by solid pillars. The number of these layers varies.\r\nTowards the end of the season there may be ten, or even more. The\r\nopening of the cells is on the lower surface. In this strange world the\r\nyoung grow, sleep, and receive their food head downwards.\r\n\r\nThe various storeys, or layers of combs, are divided by open spaces;\r\nand between the outer envelope and the stack of combs there are\r\ndoorways through which every part can be easily reached. There is a\r\ncontinual coming and going of nurses, attending to the grubs in the\r\ncells. On one side of the outer wrapper is the gate of the city, a\r\nmodest unadorned opening, lost among the thin scales of the envelope.\r\nFacing it is the entrance to the tunnel that leads from the cavity to\r\nthe world at large.\r\n\r\nIn a Wasp community there is a large number of Wasps whose whole life\r\nis spent in work. It is their business to enlarge the nest as the\r\npopulation grows; and though they have no grubs of their own, they\r\nnurse the grubs in the cells with the greatest care and industry.\r\nWishing to watch their operations, and also to see what would take\r\nplace at the approach of winter, I placed under cover one October a few\r\nfragments of a nest, containing a large number of eggs and grubs, with\r\nabout a hundred workers to take care of them.\r\n\r\nTo make my inspection easier I separated the combs and placed them side\r\nby side, with the openings of the cells turned upwards. This\r\narrangement, the reverse of the usual position, did not seem to annoy\r\nmy prisoners, who soon recovered from the disturbance and set to work\r\nas if nothing had happened. In case they should wish to build I gave\r\nthem a slip of soft wood; and I fed them with honey. The underground\r\ncave in which the nest hangs out of doors was represented by a large\r\nearthen pan under a wire-gauze cover. A removable cardboard dome\r\nprovided darkness for the Wasps, and—when removed—light for me.\r\n\r\nThe Wasps’ work went on as if it had never been interrupted. The\r\nworker-Wasps attended to the grubs and the building at the same time.\r\nThey began to raise a wall round the most thickly populated combs; and\r\nit seemed as though they might intend to build a new envelope, to\r\nreplace the one ruined by my spade. But they were not repairing; they\r\nwere simply carrying on the work from the point at which I interrupted\r\nit. Over about a third of the comb they made an arched roof of paper\r\nscales, which would have been joined to the envelope of the nest if it\r\nhad been intact. The tent they made sheltered only a small part of the\r\ndisk of cells.\r\n\r\nAs for the wood I provided for them, they did not touch it. To this raw\r\nmaterial, which would have been troublesome to work, they preferred the\r\nold cells that were no longer in use. In these the fibres were already\r\nprepared; and, with a little saliva and a little grinding in their\r\nmandibles, they turned them into pulp of the highest quality. The\r\nuninhabited cells were nibbled into pieces, and out of the ruins a sort\r\nof canopy was built. New cells could be made in the same way if\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\nEven more interesting than this roofing-work is the feeding of the\r\ngrubs. One could never weary of the sight of the rough fighters turned\r\ninto tender nurses. The barracks become a crêche. With what care those\r\ngrubs are reared! If we watch one of the busy Wasps we shall see her,\r\nwith her crop swollen with honey, halt in front of a cell. With a\r\nthoughtful air she bends her head into the opening, and touches the\r\ngrub with the tip of her antenna. The grub wakes and gapes at her, like\r\na fledgling when the mother-bird returns to the nest with food.\r\n\r\nFor a moment the awakened larva swings its head to and fro: it is\r\nblind, and is trying to feel the food brought to it. The two mouths\r\nmeet; a drop of syrup passes from the nurse’s mouth to the nurseling’s.\r\nThat is enough for the moment: now for the next Wasp-baby. The nurse\r\nmoves on, to continue her duties elsewhere.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the grub is licking the base of its own neck. For, while it\r\nis being fed, there appears a temporary swelling on its chest, which\r\nacts as a bib, and catches whatever trickles down from the mouth. After\r\nswallowing the chief part of the meal the grub gathers up the crumbs\r\nthat have fallen on its bib. Then the swelling disappears; and the\r\ngrub, withdrawing a little way into its cell, resumes its sweet\r\nslumbers.\r\n\r\nWhen fed in my cage the Wasp-grubs have their heads up, and what falls\r\nfrom their mouths collects naturally on their bibs. When fed in the\r\nnest they have their heads down. But I have no doubt that even in this\r\nposition the bib serves its purpose.\r\n\r\nBy slightly bending its head the grub can always deposit on the\r\nprojecting bib a portion of the overflowing mouthful, which is sticky\r\nenough to remain there. Moreover, it is quite possible that the nurse\r\nherself places a portion of her helping on this spot. Whether it be\r\nabove or below the mouth, right way up or upside down, the bib fulfils\r\nits office because of the sticky nature of the food. It is a temporary\r\nsaucer which shortens the work of serving out the rations, and enables\r\nthe grub to feed in a more or less leisurely fashion and without too\r\nmuch gluttony.\r\n\r\nIn the open country, late in the year when fruit is scarce, the grubs\r\nare mostly fed upon minced Fly; but in my cages everything is refused\r\nbut honey. Both nurses and nurselings seem to thrive on this diet, and\r\nif any intruder ventures too near to the combs he is doomed. Wasps, it\r\nappears, are far from hospitable. Even the Polistes, an insect who is\r\nabsolutely like a Wasp in shape and colour, is at once recognised and\r\nmobbed if she approaches the honey the Wasps are sipping. Her\r\nappearance takes nobody in for a moment, and unless she hastily retires\r\nshe will meet with a violent death. No, it is not a good thing to enter\r\na Wasps’ nest, even when the stranger wears the same uniform, pursues\r\nthe same industry, and is almost a member of the same corporation.\r\n\r\nAgain and again I have seen the savage reception given to strangers. If\r\nthe stranger be of sufficient importance he is stabbed, and his body is\r\ndragged from the nest and flung into the refuse-heap below. But the\r\npoisoned dagger seems to be reserved for great occasions. If I throw\r\nthe grub of a Saw-fly among the Wasps they show great surprise at the\r\nblack-and-green dragon; they snap at it boldly, and wound it, but\r\nwithout stinging it. They try to haul it away. The dragon resists,\r\nanchoring itself to the comb by its hooks, holding on now by its\r\nfore-legs and now by its hind-legs. At last the grub, however, weakened\r\nby its wounds, is torn from the comb and dragged bleeding to the\r\nrefuse-pit. It has taken a couple of hours to dislodge it.\r\n\r\nSupposing, on the other hand, I throw on to the combs a certain\r\nimposing grub that lives under the bark of cherry-trees, five or six\r\nWasps will at once prick it with their stings. In a couple of minutes\r\nit is dead. But the huge dead body is much too heavy to be carried out\r\nof the nest. So the Wasps, finding they cannot move the grub, eat it\r\nwhere it lies, or at least reduce its weight till they can drag the\r\nremains outside the walls.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nTHEIR SAD END\r\n\r\nProtected in this fierce way against the invasion of intruders, and fed\r\nwith excellent honey, the grubs in my cage prosper greatly. But of\r\ncourse there are exceptions. In the Wasps’ nest, as everywhere, there\r\nare weaklings who are cut down before their time.\r\n\r\nI see these puny sufferers refuse their food and slowly pine away. The\r\nnurses perceive it even more clearly. They bend their heads over the\r\ninvalid, sound it with their antennæ, and pronounce it incurable. Then\r\nthe creature at the point of death is torn ruthlessly from its cell and\r\ndragged outside the nest. In the brutal commonwealth of the Wasps the\r\ninvalid is merely a piece of rubbish, to be got rid of as soon as\r\npossible for fear of contagion. Nor indeed is this the worst. As winter\r\ndraws near the Wasps foresee their fate. They know their end is at\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nThe first cold nights of November bring a change in the nest. The\r\nbuilding proceeds with diminished enthusiasm; the visits to the pool of\r\nhoney are less constant. Household duties are relaxed. Grubs gaping\r\nwith hunger receive tardy relief, or are even neglected. Profound\r\nuneasiness seizes upon the nurses. Their former devotion is succeeded\r\nby indifference, which soon turns to dislike. What is the good of\r\ncontinuing attentions which soon will be impossible? A time of famine\r\nis coming; the nurselings in any case must die a tragic death. So the\r\ntender nurses become savage executioners.\r\n\r\n“Let us leave no orphans,” they say to themselves; “no one would care\r\nfor them after we are gone. Let us kill everything, eggs and grubs\r\nalike. A violent end is better than a slow death by starvation.”\r\n\r\nA massacre follows. The grubs are seized by the scruff of the neck,\r\nbrutally torn from their cells, dragged out of the nest, and thrown\r\ninto the refuse-heap at the bottom of the cave. The nurses, or workers,\r\nroot them out of their cells as violently as though they were strangers\r\nor dead bodies. They tug at them savagely and tear them. Then the eggs\r\nare ripped open and devoured.\r\n\r\nBefore much longer the nurses themselves, the executioners, are\r\nlanguidly dragging what remains of their lives. Day by day, with a\r\ncuriosity mingled with emotion, I watch the end of my insects. The\r\nworkers die suddenly. They come to the surface, slip down, fall on\r\ntheir backs and rise no more, as if they were struck by lightning. They\r\nhave had their day; they are slain by age, that merciless poison. Even\r\nso does a piece of clockwork become motionless when its mainspring has\r\nunwound its last spiral.\r\n\r\nThe workers are old: but the mothers are the last to be born into the\r\nnest, and have all the vigour of youth. And so, when winter sickness\r\nseizes them, they are capable of a certain resistance. Those whose end\r\nis near are easily distinguished from the others by the disorder of\r\ntheir appearance. Their backs are dusty. While they are well they dust\r\nthemselves without ceasing, and their black-and-yellow coats are kept\r\nperfectly glossy. Those who are ailing are careless of cleanliness;\r\nthey stand motionless in the sun or wander languidly about. They no\r\nlonger brush their clothes.\r\n\r\nThis indifference to dress is a bad sign. Two or three days later the\r\ndusty female leaves the nest for the last time. She goes outside, to\r\nenjoy yet a little of the sunlight; presently she slides quietly to the\r\nground and does not get up again. She declines to die in her beloved\r\npaper home, where the code of the Wasps ordains absolute cleanliness.\r\nThe dying Wasp performs her own funeral rites by dropping herself into\r\nthe pit at the bottom of the cavern. For reasons of health these stoics\r\nrefuse to die in the actual house, among the combs. The last survivors\r\nretain this repugnance to the very end. It is a law that never falls\r\ninto disuse, however greatly reduced the population may be.\r\n\r\nMy cage becomes emptier day by day, notwithstanding the mildness of the\r\nroom, and notwithstanding the saucer of honey at which the able-bodied\r\ncome to sip. At Christmas I have only a dozen females left. On the\r\nsixth of January the last of them perishes.\r\n\r\nWhence arises this mortality, which mows down the whole of my wasps?\r\nThey have not suffered from famine: they have not suffered from cold:\r\nthey have not suffered from home-sickness. Then what have they died of?\r\n\r\nWe must not blame their captivity. The same thing happens in the open\r\ncountry. Various nests I have inspected at the end of December all show\r\nthe same condition. The vast majority of Wasps must die, apparently,\r\nnot by accident, nor illness, nor the inclemency of the season, but by\r\nan inevitable destiny, which destroys them as energetically as it\r\nbrings them into life. And it is well for us that it is so. One female\r\nWasp is enough to found a city of thirty thousand inhabitants. If all\r\nwere to survive, what a scourge they would be! The Wasps would\r\ntyrannise over the countryside.\r\n\r\nIn the end the nest itself perishes. A certain Caterpillar which later\r\non becomes a mean-looking Moth; a tiny reddish Beetle; and a scaly grub\r\nclad in gold velvet, are the creatures that demolish it. They gnaw the\r\nfloors of the various storeys, and crumble the whole dwelling. A few\r\npinches of dust, a few shreds of brown paper are all that remain, by\r\nthe return of spring, of the Wasps’ city and its thirty thousand\r\ninhabitants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nTHE ADVENTURES OF A GRUB\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nTHE YOUNG SITARIS\r\n\r\nThe high banks of sandy clay in the country round about Carpentras are\r\nthe favourite haunts of a host of Bees and Wasps, those lovers of a\r\nsunny aspect and of soil that is easy to dig in. Here, in the month of\r\nMay, two Bees, both of them Mason-bees, builders of subterranean cells,\r\nare especially abundant. One of them builds at the entrance of her\r\ndwelling an advanced fortification, an earthly cylinder, wrought in\r\nopen work and curved, of the width and length of a man’s finger. When\r\nit is peopled with many Bees one stands amazed at the elaborate\r\nornamentation formed by all these hanging fingers of clay.\r\n\r\nThe other Bee, who is very much more frequently seen and is called\r\nAnthophora pilipes, leaves the opening of her corridor bare. The chinks\r\nbetween the stones in old walls and abandoned hovels, or exposed\r\nsurfaces of sand stone or marl, are found suitable for her labours; but\r\nthe favourite spots, those to which the greatest number of swarms\r\nresort, are straight stretches of ground exposed to the south, such as\r\noccur in the cuttings of deeply-sunken roads. Here, over areas many\r\nyards in width, the wall is drilled with a multitude of holes, which\r\ngive to the earthy mass the look of some enormous sponge. These round\r\nholes might have been made with a gimlet, so regular are they. Each is\r\nthe entrance to a winding corridor, which runs to the depth of four or\r\nfive inches. The cells are at the far end. If we wish to watch the\r\nlabours of the industrious Bee we must visit her workshop during the\r\nlatter half of May. Then—but at a respectful distance—we may see, in\r\nall its bewildering activity, the tumultuous, buzzing swarm, busied\r\nwith the building and provisioning of the cells.\r\n\r\nBut it has been most often during the months of August and September,\r\nthe happy months of the summer holidays, that I have visited the banks\r\ninhabited by the Anthophora. At this season all is silent near the\r\nnests: the work has long been completed: and numbers of Spiders’ webs\r\nline the crevices or plunge their silken tubes into the Bees’\r\ncorridors. That is no reason, however, for hastily abandoning the city\r\nthat was once so full of life and bustle, and now appears deserted. A\r\nfew inches below the surface, thousands of grubs are imprisoned in\r\ntheir cells of clay, resting until the coming spring. Surely these\r\ngrubs, which are paralysed and incapable of self-defence, must be a\r\ntemptation—fat little morsels as they are—to some kind of parasite,\r\nsome kind of insect stranger in search of prey. The matter is worth\r\ninquiring into.\r\n\r\nTwo facts are at once noticeable. Some dismal-looking Flies, half black\r\nand half white, are flying indolently from gallery to gallery,\r\nevidently with the object of laying their eggs there. Many of them are\r\nhanging dry and lifeless in the Spiders’ webs. At other places the\r\nentire surface of a bank is hung with the dried corpses of a certain\r\nBeetle, called the Sitaris. Among the corpses, however, are a few live\r\nBeetles, both male and female. The female Beetle invariably disappears\r\ninto the Bees’ dwelling. Without a doubt she, too, lays her eggs there.\r\n\r\nIf we give a few blows of the pick to the surface of the bank we shall\r\nfind out something more about these things. During the early days of\r\nAugust this is what we shall see: the cells forming the top layer are\r\nunlike those at a greater depth. The difference is owing to the fact\r\nthat the same establishment is used by two kinds of Bee, the Anthophora\r\nand the Osmia.\r\n\r\nThe Anthophoræ are the actual pioneers. The work of boring the\r\ngalleries is wholly theirs, and their cells are right at the end. If\r\nthey, for any reason, leave the outer cells, the Osmia comes in and\r\ntakes possession of them. She divides the corridors into unequal and\r\ninartistic cells by means of rough earthen partitions, her only idea of\r\nmasonry.\r\n\r\nThe cells of the Anthophora are faultlessly regular and perfectly\r\nfinished. They are works of art, cut out of the very substance of the\r\nearth, well out of reach of all ordinary enemies; and for this reason\r\nthe larva of this Bee has no means of spinning a cocoon. It lies naked\r\nin the cell, whose inner surface is polished like stucco.\r\n\r\nIn the Osmia’s cells, however, means of defence are required, because\r\nthey are at the surface of the soil, are roughly made, and are badly\r\nprotected by their thin partitions. So the Osmia’s grubs enclose\r\nthemselves in a very strong cocoon, which preserves them both from the\r\nrough sides of their shapeless cells and from the jaws of various\r\nenemies who prowl about the galleries. It is easy, then, in a bank\r\ninhabited by these two Bees, to recognise the cells belonging to each.\r\nThe Anthophora’s cells contain a naked grub: those of the Osmia contain\r\na grub enclosed in a cocoon.\r\n\r\nNow each of these two Bees has its own especial parasite, or uninvited\r\nguest. The parasite of the Osmia is the black-and-white Fly who is to\r\nbe seen so often at the entrance to the galleries, intent on laying her\r\neggs within them. The parasite of the Anthophora is the Sitaris, the\r\nBeetle whose corpses appear in such quantities on the surface of the\r\nbank.\r\n\r\nIf the layer of Osmia-cells be removed from the nest we can observe the\r\ncells of the Anthophora. Some will be occupied by larvæ, some by the\r\nperfect insect, and some—indeed many—will contain a singular egg-shaped\r\nshell, divided into segments with projecting breathing-pores. This\r\nshell is extremely thin and fragile; it is amber-coloured, and so\r\ntransparent that one can distinguish quite plainly through its sides a\r\nfull-grown Sitaris, struggling as though to set herself at liberty.\r\n\r\nWhat is this curious shell, which does not appear to be a Beetle’s\r\nshell at all? And how can this parasite reach a cell which seems to be\r\ninaccessible because of its position, and in which the most careful\r\nexamination under the magnifying-glass reveals no sign of violence?\r\nThree years of close observation enabled me to answer these questions,\r\nand to add one of its most astonishing chapters to the story of insect\r\nlife. Here is the result of my inquiries.\r\n\r\nThe Sitaris in the full-grown state lives only for a day or two, and\r\nits whole life is passed at the entrance to the Anthophora’s galleries.\r\nIt has no concern but the reproduction of the species. It is provided\r\nwith the usual digestive organs, but I have grave reasons to doubt\r\nwhether it actually takes any nourishment whatever. The female’s only\r\nthought is to lay her eggs. This done, she dies. The male, after\r\ncowering in a crevice for a day or two, also perishes. This is the\r\norigin of all those corpses swinging in the Spiders’ web, with which\r\nthe neighbourhood of the Anthophora’s dwelling is upholstered.\r\n\r\nAt first sight one would expect that the Sitaris, when laying her eggs,\r\nwould go from cell to cell, confiding an egg to each of the Bee-grubs.\r\nBut when, in the course of my observations, I searched the Bees’\r\ngalleries, I invariably found the eggs of the Sitaris gathered in a\r\nheap inside the entrance, at a distance of an inch or two from the\r\nopening. They are white, oval, and very small, and they stick together\r\nslightly. As for their number, I do not believe I am exaggerating when\r\nI estimate it at two thousand at least.\r\n\r\nThus, contrary to what one was to some extent entitled to suppose, the\r\neggs are not laid in the cells of the Bee; they are simply dumped in a\r\nheap inside the doorway of her dwelling. Nay more, the mother does not\r\nmake any protective structure for them; she takes no pains to shield\r\nthem from the rigours of winter; she does not even attempt to stop up\r\nthe entrance-lobby in which she has placed them, and so protect them\r\nfrom the thousand enemies that threaten them. For as long as the frosts\r\nof winter have not arrived these open galleries are trodden by Spiders\r\nand other plunderers, for whom the eggs would make an agreeable meal.\r\n\r\nThe better to observe them, I placed a number of the eggs in boxes; and\r\nwhen they hatched out about the end of September I imagined they would\r\nat once start off in search of an Anthophora-cell. I was entirely\r\nwrong. The young grubs—little black creatures no more than the\r\ntwenty-fifth of an inch long—did not move away, though provided with\r\nvigorous legs. They remained higgledy-piggledy, mixed up with the skins\r\nof the eggs whence they came. In vain I placed within their reach lumps\r\nof earth containing open Bee-cells: nothing would tempt them to move.\r\nIf I forcibly removed a few from the common heap they at once hurried\r\nback to it in order to hide themselves among the rest.\r\n\r\nAt last, to assure myself that the Sitaris-grubs, in the free state, do\r\nnot disperse after they are hatched, I went in the winter to Carpentras\r\nand inspected the banks inhabited by the Anthophoræ. There, as in my\r\nboxes, I found the grubs all piled up in heaps, all mixed up with the\r\nskins of the eggs.\r\n\r\nI was no nearer answering the question: how does the Sitaris get into\r\nthe Bees’ cells, and into a shell that does not belong to it?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST ADVENTURE\r\n\r\nThe appearance of the young Sitaris showed me at once that its habits\r\nmust be peculiar. It could not, I saw, be called on to move on an\r\nordinary surface. The spot where this larva has to live evidently\r\nexposes it to the risk of many dangerous falls, since, in order to\r\nprevent them, it is equipped with a pair of powerful mandibles, curved\r\nand sharp; robust legs which end in a long and very mobile claw; a\r\nvariety of bristles and probes; and a couple of strong spikes with\r\nsharp, hard points—an elaborate mechanism, like a sort of ploughshare,\r\ncapable of biting into the most highly polished surface. Nor is this\r\nall. It is further provided with a sticky liquid, sufficiently adhesive\r\nto hold it in position without the help of other appliances. In vain I\r\nracked my brains to guess what the substance might be, so shifting, so\r\nuncertain, and so perilous, which the young Sitaris is destined to\r\ninhabit. I waited with eager impatience for the return of the warm\r\nweather.\r\n\r\nAt the end of April the young grubs imprisoned in my cages, hitherto\r\nlying motionless and hidden in the spongy heap of egg-skins, suddenly\r\nbegan to move. They scattered, and ran about in all directions through\r\nthe boxes and jars in which they have passed the winter. Their hurried\r\nmovements and untiring energy showed they were in search of something,\r\nand the natural thing for them to seek was food. For these grubs were\r\nhatched at the end of September, and since then, that is to say for\r\nseven long months, they had taken no nourishment, although they were by\r\nno means in a state of torpor. From the moment of their hatching they\r\nare doomed, though full of life, to an absolute fast lasting for seven\r\nmonths; and when I saw their excitement I naturally supposed that an\r\nimperious hunger had set them bustling in that fashion.\r\n\r\nThe food they desired could only be the contents of the Anthophora’s\r\ncells, since at a later stage the Sitaris is found in those cells. Now\r\nthese contents are limited to honey and Bee-grubs.\r\n\r\nI offered them some cells containing larvæ: I even slipped the Sitares\r\ninto the cells, and did all sorts of things to tempt their appetite. My\r\nefforts were fruitless. Then I tried honey. In hunting for cells\r\nprovisioned with honey I lost a good part of the month of May. Having\r\nfound them I removed the Bee-grub from some of them, and laid the\r\nSitaris-grub on the surface of the honey. Never did experiment break\r\ndown so completely! Far from eating the honey, the grubs became\r\nentangled in the sticky mass and perished in it, suffocated. “I have\r\noffered you larvæ, cells, honey!” I cried in despair. “Then what do you\r\nwant, you fiendish little creatures?”\r\n\r\nWell, in the end I found out what they wanted. They wanted the\r\nAnthophora herself to carry them into the cells!\r\n\r\nWhen April comes, as I said before, the heap of grubs at the entrance\r\nto the Bees’ cells begins to show signs of activity. A few days later\r\nthey are no longer there. Strange as it may appear, they are all\r\ncareering about the country, sometimes at a great distance, clinging\r\nlike grim death to the fleece of a Bee!\r\n\r\nWhen the Anthophoræ pass by the entrance to their cells, on their way\r\neither in or out, the young Sitaris-grub, who is lying in wait there,\r\nattaches himself to one of the Bees. He wriggles into the fur and\r\nclutches it so firmly that he need not fear a fall during the long\r\njourneys of the insect that carries him. By thus attaching himself to\r\nthe Bee the Sitaris intends to get himself carried, at the right\r\nmoment, into a cell supplied with honey.\r\n\r\nOne might at first sight believe that these adventurous grubs derive\r\nfood for a time from the Bee’s body. But not at all. The young Sitares,\r\nembedded in the fleece, at right angles to the body of the Anthophora,\r\nhead inwards, tail outwards, do not stir from the spot they have\r\nselected, a point near the Bee’s shoulders. We do not see them\r\nwandering from spot to spot, exploring the Bee’s body, seeking the part\r\nwhere the skin is most delicate, as they would certainly do if they\r\nwere really feeding on the insect. On the contrary, they are always\r\nfixed on the toughest and hardest part of the Bee’s body, a little\r\nbelow the insertion of the wings, or sometimes on the head; and they\r\nremain absolutely motionless, clinging to a single hair. It seems to me\r\nundeniable that the young Sitares settle on the Bee merely to make her\r\ncarry them into the cells that she will soon be building.\r\n\r\nBut in the meantime the future parasites must hold tight to the fleece\r\nof their hostess, in spite of her rapid flights among the flowers, in\r\nspite of her rubbing against the walls of the galleries when she enters\r\nto take shelter, and in spite, above all, of the brushing which she\r\nmust often give herself with her feet, to dust herself and keep spick\r\nand span. We were wondering a little time ago what the dangerous,\r\nshifting thing could be on which the grub would have to establish\r\nitself. That thing is the hair of a Bee who makes a thousand rapid\r\njourneys, now diving into her narrow galleries, now forcing her way\r\ndown the tight throat of a flower.\r\n\r\nWe can now quite understand the use of the two spikes, which close\r\ntogether and are able to take hold of hair more easily than the most\r\ndelicate tweezers. We can see the full value of the sticky liquid that\r\nhelps the tiny creature to hold fast; and we can realise that the\r\nelastic probes and bristles on the legs serve to penetrate the Bee’s\r\ndown and anchor the grub in position. The more one considers this\r\narrangement, which seems so useless as the grub drags itself\r\nlaboriously over a smooth surface, the more does one marvel at all the\r\nmachinery which this fragile creature carries about to save it from\r\nfalling during its adventurous rides.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nTHE SECOND ADVENTURE\r\n\r\nOne 21st of May I went to Carpentras, determined to see, if possible,\r\nthe entrance of the Sitaris into the Bee’s cells.\r\n\r\nThe works were in full swing. In front of a high expanse of earth a\r\nswarm of Bees, stimulated by the sun, was dancing a crazy ballet. From\r\nthe tumultuous heart of the cloud rose a monotonous, threatening\r\nmurmur, while my bewildered eye tried to follow the movements of the\r\nthrong. Quick as a lightning-flash thousands of Anthophoræ were flying\r\nhither and thither in search of booty: thousands of others, also, were\r\narriving, laden with honey, or with mortar for their building.\r\n\r\nAt that time I knew comparatively little about these insects. It seemed\r\nto me that any one who ventured into the swarm, or—above all—who laid a\r\nrash hand on the Bees’ dwellings, would instantly be stabbed by a\r\nthousand stings. I had once observed the combs of the Hornet too\r\nclosely; and a shiver of fear passed through me.\r\n\r\nYet, to find out what I wished to know, I must needs penetrate that\r\nfearsome swarm; I must stand for whole hours, perhaps all day, watching\r\nthe works I intended to upset; lens in hand, I must examine, unmoved\r\namid the whirl, the things that were happening in the cells. Moreover,\r\nthe use of a mask, of gloves, of a covering of any kind, was out of the\r\nquestion, for my fingers and eyes must be absolutely free. No matter:\r\neven though I should leave the Bee’s nest with my face swollen beyond\r\nrecognition, I was determined that day to solve the problem that had\r\npuzzled me too long.\r\n\r\nHaving caught a few stray Anthophoræ with my net, I satisfied myself\r\nthat the Sitaris-larvae were perched, as I expected, on the Bees.\r\n\r\nI buttoned my coat tightly and entered the heart of the swarm. With a\r\nfew blows of the mattock I secured a lump of earth, and to my great\r\nsurprise found myself uninjured. A second expedition, longer than the\r\nfirst, had the same result: not a Bee touched me with her sting. After\r\nthis I remained permanently in front of the nest, removing lumps of\r\nearth, spilling the honey, and crushing the Bees, without arousing\r\nanything worse than a louder hum. For the Anthophora is a pacific\r\ncreature. When disturbed in the cells it leaves them hastily and\r\nescapes, sometimes even mortally wounded, without using its venomous\r\nsting except when it is seized and handled.\r\n\r\nThanks to this unexpected lack of spirit in the Mason-bee, I was able\r\nfor hours to investigate her cells at my leisure, seated on a stone in\r\nthe midst of the murmuring and distracted swarm, without receiving a\r\nsingle sting, though I took no precautions whatever. Country folk,\r\nhappening to pass and seeing me seated thus calmly amid the Bees,\r\nstopped aghast to ask me if I had bewitched them.\r\n\r\nIn this way I examined the cells. Some were still open, and contained\r\nonly a more or less complete store of honey. Others were closely sealed\r\nwith an earthen lid. The contents of these varied greatly. Sometimes I\r\nfound the larva of a Bee; sometimes another, fatter kind of larva; at\r\nother times honey with an egg floating on the surface. The egg was of a\r\nbeautiful white, and was shaped like a cylinder with a slight curve, a\r\nfifth or sixth of an inch in length—the egg of the Anthophora.\r\n\r\nIn a few cells I found this egg floating all alone on the surface of\r\nthe honey: in others, very many others, I saw, lying on the Bee’s egg\r\nas though on a sort of raft, a young Sitaris-grub. Its shape and size\r\nwere those of the creature when it is hatched. Here, then, was the\r\nenemy within the gates.\r\n\r\nWhen and how did it get in? In none of the cells was I able to detect\r\nany chink by which it could have entered: they were all sealed quite\r\ntightly. The parasite must have established itself in the\r\nhoney-warehouse before the warehouse was closed. On the other hand, the\r\nopen cells, full of honey but as yet without an egg, never contain a\r\nSitaris. The grub must therefore gain admittance either while the Bee\r\nis laying the egg, or else afterwards, while she is busy plastering up\r\nthe door. My experiments have convinced me that the Sitaris enters the\r\ncell in the very second when the egg is laid on the surface of the\r\nhoney.\r\n\r\nIf I take a cell full of honey, with an egg floating in it, and place\r\nit in a glass tube with some Sitaris-grubs, they very rarely venture\r\ninside it. They cannot reach the raft in safety: the honey that\r\nsurrounds it is too dangerous. If one of them by chance approaches the\r\nhoney it tries to escape as soon as it sees the sticky nature of the\r\nstuff under its feet. It often ends by falling back into the cell,\r\nwhere it dies of suffocation. It is therefore certain that the grub\r\ndoes not leave the fleece of the Bee when the latter is in her cell or\r\nnear it, in order to make a rush for the honey; for this honey would\r\ninevitably cause its death, if it so much as touched the surface.\r\n\r\nWe must remember that the young Sitaris which is found in a closed cell\r\nis always placed on the egg of the Bee. This egg not only serves as a\r\nraft for the tiny creature floating on a very treacherous lake, but\r\nalso provides it with its first meal. To get at this egg, in the centre\r\nof the lake of honey, to reach this raft which is also its first food,\r\nthe young grub must somehow contrive to avoid the fatal touch of the\r\nhoney.\r\n\r\nThere is only one way in which this can be done. The clever grub, at\r\nthe very moment when the Bee is laying her egg, slips off the Bee and\r\non to the egg, and with it reaches the surface of the honey. The egg is\r\ntoo small to hold more than one grub, and that is why we never find\r\nmore than one Sitaris in a cell. Such a performance on the part of a\r\ngrub seems extraordinarily inspired—but then the study of insects\r\nconstantly gives us examples of such inspiration.\r\n\r\nWhen dropping her egg upon the honey, then, the Anthophora at the same\r\ntime drops into her cell the mortal enemy of her race. She carefully\r\nplasters the lid which closes the entrance to the cell, and all is\r\ndone. A second cell is built beside it, probably to suffer the same\r\nfate; and so on until all the parasites sheltered by her fleece are\r\ncomfortably housed. Let us leave the unhappy mother to continue her\r\nfruitless task, and turn our attention to the young larva which has so\r\ncleverly secured for itself board and lodging.\r\n\r\nLet us suppose that we remove the lid from a cell in which the egg,\r\nrecently laid, supports a Sitaris-grub. The egg is intact and in\r\nperfect condition. But now the work of destruction begins. The grub, a\r\ntiny black speck which we see running over the white surface of the\r\negg, at last stops and balances itself firmly on its six legs; then,\r\nseizing the delicate skin of the egg with the sharp hooks of its\r\nmandibles, it tugs at it violently till it breaks and spills the\r\ncontents. These contents the grub eagerly drinks up. Thus the first\r\nstroke of the parasite’s mandibles is aimed at the destruction of the\r\nBee’s egg.\r\n\r\nThis is a very wise precaution on the part of the Sitaris-grub! It will\r\nhave to feed on the honey in the cell: the Bee’s grub which would come\r\nout of the egg would also require the honey: there is not enough for\r\ntwo. So—quick!—a bite at the egg, and the difficulty is removed.\r\n\r\nMoreover, another reason for the destruction of the egg is that special\r\ntastes compel the young Sitaris to make its first meals of it. The tiny\r\ncreature begins by greedily drinking the juices which the torn wrapper\r\nof the egg allows to escape. For several days it continues to rip the\r\nenvelope gradually open, and to feed on the liquid that trickles from\r\nit. Meanwhile it never touches the honey that surrounds it. The Bee’s\r\negg is absolutely necessary to the Sitaris-grub, not merely as a boat,\r\nbut also as nourishment.\r\n\r\nAt the end of a week the egg is nothing but a dry skin. The first meal\r\nis finished. The Sitaris-grub, which is now twice as large as before,\r\nsplits open along the back, and through this slit the second form of\r\nthis singular Beetle falls on the surface of the honey. Its cast skin\r\nremains on the raft, and will presently disappear with it beneath the\r\nwaves of honey.\r\n\r\nHere ends the history of the first form adopted by the Sitaris.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nTHE CRICKET\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nTHE HOUSEHOLDER\r\n\r\nThe Field Cricket, the inhabitant of the meadows, is almost as famous\r\nas the Cicada, and figures among the limited but glorious number of the\r\nclassic insects. He owes this honour to his song and his house. One\r\nthing alone is lacking to complete his renown. The master of the art of\r\nmaking animals talk, La Fontaine, gives him hardly two lines.\r\n\r\nFlorian, the other French writer of fables, gives us a story of a\r\nCricket, but it lacks the simplicity of truth and the saving salt of\r\nhumour. Besides, it represents the Cricket as discontented, bewailing\r\nhis condition! This is a preposterous idea, for all who have studied\r\nhim know, on the contrary, that he is very well pleased with his own\r\ntalent and his own burrow. And indeed, at the end of the story, Florian\r\nmakes him admit:\r\n\r\n\r\n        “My snug little home is a place of delight;\r\n        If you want to live happy, live hidden from sight!”\r\n\r\n\r\nI find more force and truth in some verses by a friend of mine, of\r\nwhich these are a translation:\r\n\r\n\r\n        Among the beasts a tale is told\r\n          How a poor Cricket ventured nigh\r\n        His door to catch the sun’s warm gold\r\n          And saw a radiant Butterfly.\r\n\r\n        She passed with tails thrown proudly back\r\n          And long gay rows of crescents blue,\r\n        Brave yellow stars and bands of black,\r\n          The lordliest Fly that ever flew.\r\n\r\n        “Ah, fly away,” the hermit said,\r\n          “Daylong among your flowers to roam;\r\n        Nor daisies white nor roses red\r\n          Will compensate my lowly home.”\r\n\r\n        True, all too true! There came a storm\r\n          And caught the Fly within its flood,\r\n        Staining her broken velvet form\r\n          And covering her wings with mud.\r\n\r\n        The Cricket, sheltered from the rain,\r\n          Chirped, and looked on with tranquil eye;\r\n        For him the thunder pealed in vain,\r\n          The gale and torrent passed him by.\r\n\r\n        Then shun the world, nor take your fill\r\n          Of any of its joys or flowers;\r\n        A lowly fireside, calm and still,\r\n          At least will grant you tearless hours! [2]\r\n\r\n\r\nThere I recognise my Cricket. I see him curling his antennæ on the\r\nthreshold of his burrow, keeping himself cool in front and warm at the\r\nback. He is not jealous of the Butterfly; on the contrary, he pities\r\nher, with that air of mocking commiseration we often see in those who\r\nhave houses of their own when they are talking to those who have none.\r\nFar from complaining, he is very well satisfied both with his house and\r\nhis violin. He is a true philosopher: he knows the vanity of things and\r\nfeels the charm of a modest retreat away from the riot of\r\npleasure-seekers.\r\n\r\nYes, the description is about right, as far as it goes. But the Cricket\r\nis still waiting for the few lines needed to bring his merits before\r\nthe public; and since La Fontaine neglected him, he will have to go on\r\nwaiting a long time.\r\n\r\nTo me, as a naturalist, the important point in the two fables is the\r\nburrow on which the moral is founded. Florian speaks of the snug\r\nretreat; the other praises his lowly home. It is the dwelling,\r\ntherefore, that above all compels attention, even that of the poet, who\r\nas a rule cares little for realities.\r\n\r\nIn this matter, indeed, the Cricket is extraordinary. Of all our\r\ninsects he is the only one who, when full-grown, possesses a fixed\r\nhome, the reward of his own industry. During the bad season of the\r\nyear, most of the others burrow or skulk in some temporary refuge, a\r\nrefuge obtained free of cost and abandoned without regret. Several of\r\nthem create marvels with a view to settling their family: cotton\r\nsatchels, baskets made of leaves, towers of cement. Some live\r\npermanently in ambush, lying in wait for their prey. The Tiger-beetle,\r\nfor instance, digs himself a perpendicular hole, which he stops up with\r\nhis flat, bronze head. If any other insect steps on this deceptive\r\ntrap-door it immediately tips up, and the unhappy wayfarer disappears\r\ninto the gulf. The Ant-lion makes a slanting funnel in the sand. Its\r\nvictim, the Ant, slides down the slant and is then stoned, from the\r\nbottom of the funnel, by the hunter, who turns his neck into a\r\ncatapult. But these are all temporary refuges or traps.\r\n\r\nThe laboriously constructed home, in which the insect settles down with\r\nno intention of moving, either in the happy spring or in the woeful\r\nwinter season; the real manor-house, built for peace and comfort, and\r\nnot as a hunting-box or a nursery—this is known to the Cricket alone.\r\nOn some sunny, grassy slope he is the owner of a hermitage. While all\r\nthe others lead vagabond lives, sleeping in the open air or under the\r\ncasual shelter of a dead leaf or a stone, or the pealing bark of an old\r\ntree, he is a privileged person with a permanent address.\r\n\r\nThe making of a home is a serious problem. It has been solved by the\r\nCricket, by the Rabbit, and lastly by man. In my neighbourhood the Fox\r\nand the Badger have holes, which are largely formed by the\r\nirregularities of the rock. A few repairs, and the dug-out is\r\ncompleted. The Rabbit is cleverer than these, for he builds his house\r\nby burrowing wherever he pleases, when there is no natural passage that\r\nallows him to settle down free of all trouble.\r\n\r\nThe Cricket is cleverer than any of them. He scorns chance refuges, and\r\nalways chooses the site of his home carefully, in well-drained ground,\r\nwith a pleasant sunny aspect. He refuses to make use of ready-made\r\ncaves that are inconvenient and rough: he digs every bit of his villa,\r\nfrom the entrance-hall to the back-room.\r\n\r\nI see no one above him, in the art of house-building, except man; and\r\neven man, before mixing mortar to hold stones together, or kneading\r\nclay to coat his hut of branches, fought with wild beasts for a refuge\r\nin the rocks. Why is it that a special instinct is bestowed on one\r\nparticular creature? Here is one of the humblest of creatures able to\r\nlodge himself to perfection. He has a home, an advantage unknown to\r\nmany civilised beings; he has a peaceful retreat, the first condition\r\nof comfort; and no one around him is capable of settling down. He has\r\nno rivals but ourselves.\r\n\r\nWhence does he derive this gift? Is he favoured with special tools? No,\r\nthe Cricket is not an expert in the art of digging; in fact, one is\r\nrather surprised at the result when one considers the feebleness of his\r\nmeans.\r\n\r\nIs a home a necessity to him, on account of an exceptionally delicate\r\nskin? No, his near kinsmen have skins as sensitive as his, yet do not\r\ndread the open air at all.\r\n\r\nIs the house-building talent the result of his anatomy? Has he any\r\nspecial organ that suggests it? No: in my neighbourhood there are three\r\nother Crickets who are so much like the Field Cricket in appearance,\r\ncolour, and structure, that at the first glance one would take them for\r\nhim. Of these faithful copies, not one knows how to dig himself a\r\nburrow. The Double-spotted Cricket inhabits the heaps of grass that are\r\nleft to rot in damp places; the Solitary Cricket roams about the dry\r\nclods turned up by the gardener’s spade; the Bordeaux Cricket is not\r\nafraid to make his way into our houses, where he sings discreetly,\r\nduring August and September, in some cool, dark spot.\r\n\r\nThere is no object in continuing these questions: the answer would\r\nalways be No. Instinct never tells us its causes. It depends so little\r\non an insect’s stock of tools that no detail of anatomy, nothing in the\r\ncreature’s formation, can explain it to us or make us foresee it. These\r\nfour similar Crickets, of whom only one can burrow, are enough to show\r\nus our ignorance of the origin of instinct.\r\n\r\nWho does not know the Cricket’s house? Who has not, as a child playing\r\nin the fields, stopped in front of the hermit’s cabin? However light\r\nyour footfall, he has heard you coming, and has abruptly withdrawn to\r\nthe very bottom of his hiding-place. When you arrive, the threshold of\r\nthe house is deserted.\r\n\r\nEvery one knows the way to bring out the skulker. You insert a straw\r\nand move it gently about the burrow. Surprised at what is happening\r\nabove, the tickled and teased Cricket ascends from his back room; he\r\nstops in the passage, hesitates, and waves his delicate antennæ\r\ninquiringly. He comes to the light, and, once outside, he is easy to\r\ncatch, since these events have puzzled his poor head. Should he be\r\nmissed at the first attempt he may become suspicious and refuse to\r\nappear. In that case he can be flooded out with a glass of water.\r\n\r\nThose were adorable times when we were children, and hunted Crickets\r\nalong the grassy paths, and put them in cages, and fed them on a leaf\r\nof lettuce. They all come back to me to-day, those times, as I search\r\nthe burrows for subjects to study. They seem like yesterday when my\r\ncompanion, little Paul, an expert in the use of the straw, springs up\r\nsuddenly after a long trial of skill and patience, and cries excitedly:\r\n“I’ve got him! I’ve got him!”\r\n\r\nQuick, here’s a bag! In you go, my little Cricket! You shall be petted\r\nand pampered, but you must teach us something, and first of all you\r\nmust show us your house.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nHIS HOUSE\r\n\r\nIt is a slanting gallery in the grass, on some sunny bank which soon\r\ndries after a shower. It is nine inches long at most, hardly as thick\r\nas one’s finger, and straight or bent according to the nature of the\r\nground. As a rule, a tuft of grass half conceals the home, serving as a\r\nporch and throwing the entrance discreetly into shadow. When the\r\nCricket goes out to browse upon the surrounding turf he does not touch\r\nthis tuft. The gently sloping threshold, carefully raked and swept,\r\nextends for some distance; and this is the terrace on which, when\r\neverything is peaceful round about, the Cricket sits and scrapes his\r\nfiddle.\r\n\r\nThe inside of the house is devoid of luxury, with bare and yet not\r\ncoarse walls. The inhabitant has plenty of leisure to do away with any\r\nunpleasant roughness. At the end of the passage is the bedroom, a\r\nlittle more carefully smoothed than the rest, and slightly wider. All\r\nsaid, it is a very simple abode, exceedingly clean, free from damp, and\r\nconforming to the rules of hygiene. On the other hand, it is an\r\nenormous undertaking, a gigantic tunnel, when we consider the modest\r\ntools with which the Cricket has to dig. If we wish to know how he does\r\nit, and when he sets to work, we must go back to the time when the egg\r\nis laid.\r\n\r\nThe Cricket lays her eggs singly in the soil, like the Decticus, at a\r\ndepth of three-quarters of an inch. She arranges them in groups, and\r\nlays altogether about five or six hundred. The egg is a little marvel\r\nof mechanism. After the hatching it appears as an opaque white\r\ncylinder, with a round and very regular hole at the top. To the edge of\r\nthis hole is fastened a cap, like a lid. Instead of bursting open\r\nanyhow under the thrusts of the larva within, it opens of its own\r\naccord along a circular line—a specially prepared line of least\r\nresistance.\r\n\r\nAbout a fortnight after the egg is laid, two large, round, rusty-black\r\ndots darken the front end. A little way above these two dots, right at\r\nthe top of the cylinder, you see the outline of a thin circular\r\nswelling. This is the line where the shell is preparing to break open.\r\nSoon the transparency of the egg allows one to see the delicate\r\nmarkings of the tiny creature’s segments. Now is the time to be on the\r\nwatch, especially in the morning.\r\n\r\nFortune loves the persevering, and if we pay constant visits to the\r\neggs we shall be rewarded. All round the swelling, where the resistance\r\nof the shell has gradually been overcome, the end of the egg becomes\r\ndetached. Being pushed back by the forehead of the little creature\r\nwithin, it rises and falls to one side like the top of a tiny\r\nscent-bottle. The Cricket pops out like a Jack-in-the-box.\r\n\r\nWhen he is gone the shell remains distended, smooth, intact, pure\r\nwhite, with the cap or lid hanging from the opening. A bird’s egg\r\nbreaks clumsily under the blows of a wart that grows for the purpose at\r\nthe end of the Chick’s beak; the Cricket’s egg is more ingeniously\r\nmade, and opens like an ivory case. The thrust of the creature’s head\r\nis enough to work the hinge.\r\n\r\nI said above that, when the lid is lifted, a young Cricket pops out;\r\nbut this is not quite accurate. What appears is the swaddled grub, as\r\nyet unrecognisable in a tight-fitting sheath. The Decticus, you will\r\nremember, who is hatched in the same way under the soil, wears a\r\nprotective covering during his journey to the surface. The Cricket is\r\nrelated to the Decticus, and therefore wears the same livery, although\r\nin point of fact he does not need it. The egg of the Decticus remains\r\nunderground for eight months, so the poor grub has to fight its way\r\nthrough soil that has grown hard, and it therefore needs a covering for\r\nits long shanks. But the Cricket is shorter and stouter, and since its\r\negg is only in the ground for a few days it has nothing worse than a\r\npowdery layer of earth to pass through. For these reasons it requires\r\nno overall, and leaves it behind in the shell.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he is rid of his swaddling-clothes the young Cricket, pale\r\nall over, almost white, begins to battle with the soil overhead. He\r\nhits out with his mandibles; he sweeps aside and kicks behind him the\r\npowdery earth, which offers no resistance. Very soon he is on the\r\nsurface, amidst the joys of the sunlight and the perils of conflict\r\nwith his fellow-creatures—poor feeble mite that he is, hardly larger\r\nthan a Flea.\r\n\r\nBy the end of twenty-four hours he has turned into a magnificent\r\nblackamoor, whose ebon hue vies with that of the full-grown insect. All\r\nthat remains of his original pallor is a white sash that girds his\r\nchest. Very nimble and alert, he sounds the surrounding air with his\r\nlong, quivering antennæ, and runs and jumps about with great\r\nimpetuosity. Some day he will be too fat to indulge in such antics.\r\n\r\nAnd now we see why the mother Cricket lays so many eggs. It is because\r\nmost of the young ones are doomed to death. They are massacred in huge\r\nnumbers by other insects, and especially by the little Grey Lizard and\r\nthe Ant. The latter, loathsome freebooter that she is, hardly leaves me\r\na Cricket in my garden. She snaps up the poor little creatures and\r\ngobbles them down at frantic speed.\r\n\r\nOh, the execrable wretch! And to think that we place the Ant in the\r\nfront rank of insects! Books are written in her honour, and the stream\r\nof praise never runs dry. The naturalists hold her in great esteem; and\r\nadd daily to her fame. It would seem that with animals, as with men,\r\nthe surest way to attract attention is to do harm to others.\r\n\r\nNobody asks about the Beetles who do such valuable work as scavengers,\r\nwhereas everybody knows the Gnat, that drinker of men’s blood; the\r\nWasp, that hot-tempered swashbuckler, with her poisoned dagger; and the\r\nAnt, that notorious evil-doer who, in our southern villages, saps and\r\nimperils the rafters of a dwelling as cheerfully as she eats a fig.\r\n\r\nThe Ant massacres the Crickets in my garden so thoroughly that I am\r\ndriven to look for them outside the enclosure. In August, among the\r\nfallen leaves, where the grass has not been wholly scorched by the sun,\r\nI find the young Cricket, already rather big, and now black all over,\r\nwith not a vestige of his white girdle remaining. At this period of his\r\nlife he is a vagabond: the shelter of a dead leaf or a flat stone is\r\nenough for him.\r\n\r\nMany of those who survived the raids of the Ants now fall victims to\r\nthe Wasp, who hunts down the wanderers and stores them underground. If\r\nthey would but dig their dwellings a few weeks before the usual time\r\nthey would be saved; but they never think of it. They are faithful to\r\ntheir ancient customs.\r\n\r\nIt is at the close of October, when the first cold weather threatens,\r\nthat the burrow is taken in hand. The work is very simple, if I may\r\njudge by my observation of the caged insect. The digging is never done\r\nat a bare point in the pan, but always under the shelter of some\r\nwithered lettuce-leaf, a remnant of the food provided. This takes the\r\nplace of the grass tuft that seems indispensable to the secrecy of the\r\nhome.\r\n\r\nThe miner scrapes with his fore-legs, and uses the pincers of his\r\nmandibles to pull out the larger bits of gravel. I see him stamping\r\nwith his powerful hind-legs, furnished with a double row of spikes; I\r\nsee him raking the rubbish, sweeping it backwards and spreading it\r\nslantwise. There you have the whole process.\r\n\r\nThe work proceeds pretty quickly at first. In the yielding soil of my\r\ncages the digger disappears underground after a spell that lasts a\r\ncouple of hours. He returns to the entrance at intervals, always\r\nbackwards and always sweeping. Should he be overcome with fatigue he\r\ntakes a rest on the threshold of his half-finished home, with his head\r\noutside and his antennæ waving feebly. He goes in again, and resumes\r\nwork with pincers and rakes. Soon the periods of rest become longer,\r\nand wear out my patience.\r\n\r\nThe most urgent part of the work is done. Once the hole is a couple of\r\ninches deep, it suffices for the needs of the moment. The rest will be\r\na long affair, carried out in a leisurely way, a little one day and a\r\nlittle the next: the hole will be made deeper and wider as the weather\r\ngrows colder and the insect larger. Even in winter, if the temperature\r\nbe mild and the sun shining on the entrance to the dwelling, it is not\r\nunusual to see the Cricket shooting out rubbish. Amid the joys of\r\nspring the upkeep of the building still continues. It is constantly\r\nundergoing improvements and repairs until the owner’s death.\r\n\r\nWhen April ends the Cricket’s song begins; at first in rare and shy\r\nsolos, but soon in a general symphony in which each clod of turf boasts\r\nits performer. I am more than inclined to place the Cricket at the head\r\nof the spring choristers. In our waste-lands, when the thyme and\r\nlavender are gaily flowering, the Crested Lark rises like a lyrical\r\nrocket, his throat swelling with notes, and from the sky sheds his\r\nsweet music upon the fallows. Down below the Crickets chant the\r\nresponses. Their song is monotonous and artless, but well suited in its\r\nvery lack of art to the simple gladness of reviving life. It is the\r\nhosanna of the awakening, the sacred alleluia understood by swelling\r\nseed and sprouting blade. In this duet I should award the palm to the\r\nCricket. His numbers and his unceasing note deserve it. Were the Lark\r\nto fall silent, the fields blue-grey with lavender, swinging its\r\nfragrant censors before the sun, would still receive from this humble\r\nchorister a solemn hymn of praise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nHIS MUSICAL-BOX\r\n\r\nIn steps Science, and says to the Cricket bluntly:\r\n\r\n“Show us your musical-box.”\r\n\r\nLike all things of real value, it is very simple. It is based on the\r\nsame principle as that of the Grasshoppers: a bow with a hook to it,\r\nand a vibrating membrane. The right wing-case overlaps the left and\r\ncovers it almost completely, except where it folds back sharply and\r\nencases the insect’s side. It is the opposite arrangement to that which\r\nwe find in the Green Grasshopper, the Decticus, and their kinsmen. The\r\nCricket is right-handed, the others left-handed.\r\n\r\nThe two wing-cases are made in exactly the same way. To know one is to\r\nknow the other. They lie flat on the insect’s back, and slant suddenly\r\nat the side in a right-angled fold, encircling the body with a\r\ndelicately veined pinion.\r\n\r\nIf you hold one of these wing-cases up to the light you will see that\r\nis it a very pale red, save for two large adjoining spaces; a larger,\r\ntriangular one in front, and a smaller, oval one at the back. They are\r\ncrossed by faint wrinkles. These two spaces are the sounding-boards, or\r\ndrums. The skin is finer here than elsewhere, and transparent, though\r\nof a somewhat smoky tint.\r\n\r\nAt the hinder edge of the front part are two curved, parallel veins,\r\nwith a cavity between them. This cavity contains five or six little\r\nblack wrinkles that look like the rungs of a tiny ladder. They supply\r\nfriction: they intensify the vibration by increasing the number of\r\npoints touched by the bow.\r\n\r\nOn the lower surface one of the two veins that surround the cavity of\r\nthe rungs becomes a rib cut into the shape of a hook. This is the bow.\r\nIt is provided with about a hundred and fifty triangular teeth of\r\nexquisite geometrical regularity.\r\n\r\nIt is a fine instrument indeed. The hundred and fifty teeth of the bow,\r\nbiting into the rungs of the opposite wing-case, set the four drums in\r\nmotion at one and the same time, the lower pair by direct friction, the\r\nupper pair by the shaking of the friction-apparatus. What a rush of\r\nsound! The Cricket with his four drums throws his music to a distance\r\nof some hundreds of yards.\r\n\r\nHe vies with the Cicada in shrillness, without having the latter’s\r\ndisagreeable harshness. And better still: this favoured creature knows\r\nhow to modulate his song. The wing-cases, as I said, extend over each\r\nside in a wide fold. These are the dampers which, lowered to a greater\r\nor less depth, alter the intensity of the sound. According to the\r\nextent of their contact with the soft body of the Cricket they allow\r\nhim to sing gently at one time and fortissimo at another.\r\n\r\nThe exact similarity of the two wing-cases is worthy of attention. I\r\ncan see clearly the function of the upper bow, and the four\r\nsounding-spaces which sets it in motion; but what is the good of the\r\nlower one, the bow on the left wing? Not resting on anything, it has\r\nnothing to strike with its hook, which is as carefully toothed as the\r\nother. It is absolutely useless, unless the apparatus can invert the\r\norder of its two parts, and place that above which is below. If that\r\ncould be done, the perfect symmetry of the instrument is such that the\r\nmechanism would be the same as before, and the insect would be able to\r\nplay with the bow that is at present useless. The lower fiddlestick\r\nwould become the upper, and the tune would be the same.\r\n\r\nI suspected at first that the Cricket could use both bows, or at least\r\nthat there were some who were permanently left-handed. But observation\r\nhas convinced me of the contrary. All the Crickets I have examined—and\r\nthey are many—without a single exception carried the right wing-case\r\nabove the left.\r\n\r\nI even tried to bring about by artificial means what Nature refused to\r\nshow me. Using my forceps, very gently of course, and without straining\r\nthe wing-cases, I made these overlap the opposite way. It is easily\r\ndone with a little skill and patience. Everything went well: there was\r\nno dislocation of the shoulders, the membranes were not creased.\r\n\r\nI almost expected the Cricket to sing, but I was soon undeceived. He\r\nsubmitted for a few moments; but then, finding himself uncomfortable,\r\nhe made an effort and restored his instrument to its usual position. In\r\nvain I repeated the operation: the Cricket’s obstinacy triumphed over\r\nmine.\r\n\r\nThen I thought I would make the attempt while the wing-cases were quite\r\nnew and plastic, at the moment when the larva casts its skin. I secured\r\none at the point of being transformed. At this stage the future wings\r\nand wing-cases form four tiny flaps, which, by their shape and\r\nscantiness, and by the way they stick out in different directions,\r\nremind me of the short jackets worn by the Auvergne cheesemakers. The\r\nlarva cast off these garments before my eyes.\r\n\r\nThe wing-cases developed bit by bit, and opened out. There was no sign\r\nto tell me which would overlap the other. Then the edges touched: a few\r\nmoments longer and the right would be over the left. This was the time\r\nto intervene.\r\n\r\nWith a straw I gently changed the position, bringing the left edge over\r\nthe right. In spite of some protest from the insect I was quite\r\nsuccessful: the left wing-case pushed forward, though only very little.\r\nThen I left it alone, and gradually the wing-cases matured in the\r\ninverted position. The Cricket was left-handed. I expected soon to see\r\nhim wield the fiddlestick which the members of his family never employ.\r\n\r\nOn the third day he made a start. A few brief grating sounds were\r\nheard—the noise of a machine out of gear shifting its parts back into\r\ntheir proper order. Then the tune began, with its accustomed tone and\r\nrhythm.\r\n\r\nAlas, I had been over-confident in my mischievous straw! I thought I\r\nhad created a new type of instrumentalist, and I had obtained nothing\r\nat all! The Cricket was scraping with his right fiddlestick, and always\r\nwould. With a painful effort he had dislocated his shoulders, which I\r\nhad forced to harden in the wrong way. He had put back on top that\r\nwhich ought to be on top, and underneath that which ought to be\r\nunderneath. My sorry science tried to make a left-handed player of him.\r\nHe laughed at my devices, and settled down to be right-handed for the\r\nrest of his life.\r\n\r\nEnough of the instrument; let us listen to the music. The Cricket sings\r\non the threshold of his house, in the cheerful sunshine, never indoors.\r\nThe wing-cases utter their cri-cri in a soft tremolo. It is full,\r\nsonorous, nicely cadenced, and lasts indefinitely. Thus are the\r\nleisures of solitude beguiled all through the spring. The hermit at\r\nfirst sings for his own pleasure. Glad to be alive, he chants the\r\npraises of the sun that shines upon him, the grass that feeds him, the\r\npeaceful retreat that harbours him. The first object of his bow is to\r\nhymn the pleasures of life.\r\n\r\nLater on he plays to his mate. But, to tell the truth, his attention is\r\nrewarded with little gratitude; for in the end she quarrels with him\r\nferociously, and unless he takes to flight she cripples him—and even\r\neats him more or less. But indeed, in any case he soon dies. Even if he\r\nescapes his pugnacious mate, he perishes in June. We are told that the\r\nmusic-loving Greeks used to keep Cicadæ in cages, the better to enjoy\r\ntheir singing. I venture to disbelieve the story. In the first place\r\nthe harsh clicking of the Cicadæ, when long continued at close\r\nquarters, is a torture to ears that are at all delicate. The Greeks’\r\nsense of hearing was too well trained to take pleasure in such raucous\r\nsounds away from the general concert of the fields, which is heard at a\r\ndistance.\r\n\r\nIn the second place it is absolutely impossible to bring up Cicadæ in\r\ncaptivity, unless we cover over a whole olive-tree or plane-tree. A\r\nsingle day spent in a cramped enclosure would make the high-flying\r\ninsect die of boredom.\r\n\r\nIs it not possible that people have confused the Cricket with the\r\nCicada, as they also do the Green Grasshopper? With the Cricket they\r\nwould be quite right. He is one who bears captivity gaily: his\r\nstay-at-home ways predispose him to it. He lives happily and whirrs\r\nwithout ceasing in a cage no larger than a man’s fist, provided that he\r\nhas his lettuce-leaf every day. Was it not he whom the small boys of\r\nAthens reared in little wire cages hanging on a window-frame?\r\n\r\nThe small boys of Provence, and all the South, have the same tastes. In\r\nthe towns a Cricket becomes the child’s treasured possession. The\r\ninsect, petted and pampered, sings to him of the simple joys of the\r\ncountry. Its death throws the whole household into a sort of mourning.\r\n\r\nThe three other Crickets of my neighbourhood all carry the same musical\r\ninstrument as the Field Cricket, with slight variation of detail. Their\r\nsong is much alike in all cases, allowing for differences of size. The\r\nsmallest of the family, the Bordeaux Cricket, sometimes ventures into\r\nthe dark corners of my kitchen, but his song is so faint that it takes\r\na very attentive ear to hear it.\r\n\r\nThe Field Cricket sings during the sunniest hours of the spring: during\r\nthe still summer nights we have the Italian Cricket. He is a slender,\r\nfeeble insect, quite pale, almost white, as beseems his nocturnal\r\nhabits. You are afraid of crushing him, if you so much as take him in\r\nyour fingers. He lives high in air, on shrubs of every kind, or on the\r\ntaller grasses; and he rarely descends to earth. His song, the sweet\r\nmusic of the still, hot evenings from July to October; begins at sunset\r\nand continues for the best part of the night.\r\n\r\nThis song is known to everybody here in Provence, for the smallest\r\nclump of bushes has its orchestra. The soft, slow gri-i-i gri-i-i is\r\nmade more expressive by a slight tremolo. If nothing happens to disturb\r\nthe insect the sound remains unaltered; but at the least noise the\r\nmusician becomes a ventriloquist. You hear him quite close, in front of\r\nyou; and then, all of a sudden, you hear him fifteen yards away. You\r\nmove towards the sound. It is not there: it comes from the original\r\nplace. No, it doesn’t after all. Is it over there on the left, or does\r\nit come from behind? One is absolutely at a loss, quite unable to find\r\nthe spot where the music is chirping.\r\n\r\nThis illusion of varying distance is produced in two ways. The sounds\r\nbecome loud or soft, open or muffled, according to the exact part of\r\nthe lower wing-case that is pressed by the bow. And they are also\r\nmodified by the position of the wing-cases. For the loud sounds these\r\nare raised to their full height: for the muffled sounds they are\r\nlowered more or less. The pale Cricket misleads those who hunt for him\r\nby pressing the edges of his vibrating flaps against his soft body.\r\n\r\nI know no prettier or more limpid insect-song than his, heard in the\r\ndeep stillness of an August evening. How often have I lain down on the\r\nground among the rosemary bushes of my harmas, to listen to the\r\ndelightful concert!\r\n\r\nThe Italian Cricket swarms in my enclosure. Every tuft of red-flowering\r\nrock-rose has its chorister; so has every clump of lavender. The bushy\r\narbutus-shrubs, the turpentine-trees, all become orchestras. And in its\r\nclear voice, so full of charm, the whole of this little world, from\r\nevery shrub and every branch, sings of the gladness of life.\r\n\r\nHigh up above my head the Swan stretches its great cross along the\r\nMilky Way: below, all round me, the insect’s symphony rises and falls.\r\nInfinitesimal life telling its joys makes me forget the pageant of the\r\nstars. Those celestial eyes look down upon me, placid and cold, but do\r\nnot stir a fibre within me. Why? They lack the great secret—life. Our\r\nreason tells us, it is true, that those suns warm worlds like ours; but\r\nwhen all is said, this belief is no more than a guess, it is not a\r\ncertainty.\r\n\r\nIn your company, on the contrary, O my Cricket, I feel the throbbing of\r\nlife, which is the soul of our lump of clay; and that is why, under my\r\nrosemary-hedge, I give but an absent glance at the constellation of the\r\nSwan and devote all my attention to your serenade! A living speck—the\r\nmerest dab of life—capable of pleasure and pain, is far more\r\ninteresting to me than all the immensities of mere matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nTHE SISYPHUS\r\n\r\n\r\nYou are not tired, I hope, of hearing about the Scavenger Beetles with\r\na talent for making balls. I have told you of the Sacred Beetle and of\r\nthe Spanish Copris, and now I wish to say a few words of yet another of\r\nthese creatures. In the insect world we meet with a great many model\r\nmothers: it is only fair, for once to draw attention to a good father.\r\n\r\nNow a good father is rarely seen except among the higher animals. The\r\nbird is excellent in this respect, and the furred folk perform their\r\nduties honourably. Lower in the scale of living creatures the father is\r\ngenerally indifferent to his family. Very few insects are exceptions to\r\nthis rule. This heartlessness, which would be detestable in the higher\r\nranks of the animal kingdom, where the weakness of the young demands\r\nprolonged care, is excusable among insect fathers. For the robustness\r\nof the new-born insect enables it to gather its food unaided, provided\r\nit be in a suitable place. When all that the Pieris need do for the\r\nsafety of the race is to lay her eggs on the leaves of a cabbage, of\r\nwhat use would a father’s care be? The mother’s botanical instinct\r\nneeds no assistance. At laying-time the other parent would be in the\r\nway.\r\n\r\nMost insects adopt this simple method of upbringing. They merely choose\r\na dining-room which will be the home of the family once it is hatched,\r\nor else a place that will allow the young ones to find suitable fare\r\nfor themselves. There is no need for the father in such cases. He\r\ngenerally dies without lending the least assistance in the work of\r\nsetting up his offspring in life.\r\n\r\nThings do not always happen, however, in quite such a primitive\r\nfashion. There are tribes that provide a dowry for their families, that\r\nprepare board and lodging for them in advance. The Bees and Wasps in\r\nparticular are masters in the industry of making cellars, jars, and\r\nsatchels, in which the ration of honey is hoarded: they are perfect in\r\nthe art of creating burrows stocked with the game that forms the food\r\nof their grubs.\r\n\r\nWell, this enormous labour, which is one of building and provisioning\r\ncombined, this toil in which the insect’s whole life is spent, is done\r\nby the mother alone. It wears her out; it utterly exhausts her. The\r\nfather drunk with sunlight, stands idle at the edge of the workyard,\r\nwatching his plucky helpmate at her job.\r\n\r\nWhy does he not lend the mother a helping hand? It is now or never. Why\r\ndoes he not follow the example of the Swallow couple, both of whom\r\nbring their bit of straw, their blob of mortar to the building and\r\ntheir Midge to the young ones? He does nothing of the kind. Possibly he\r\nputs forward his comparative weakness as an excuse. It is a poor\r\nargument; for to cut a disk out of a leaf, to scrape some cotton from a\r\ndowny plant, to collect a little bit of cement in muddy places would\r\nnot overtax his strength. He could very easily help, at any rate as a\r\nlabourer; he is quite fit to gather materials for the mother, with her\r\ngreater intelligence, to fit in place. The real reason of his\r\ninactivity is sheer incapability.\r\n\r\nIt is strange that the most gifted of the industrial insects should\r\nknow nothing of a father’s duties. One would expect the highest talents\r\nto be developed in him by the needs of the young; but he remains as\r\ndull-witted as a Butterfly, whose family is reared at so small a cost.\r\nWe are baffled at every turn by the question: Why is a particular\r\ninstinct given to one insect and denied to another?\r\n\r\nIt baffles us so thoroughly that we are extremely surprised when we\r\nfind in the scavenger the noble qualities that are denied to the\r\nhoney-gatherer. Various Scavenger Beetles are accustomed to help in the\r\nburden of housekeeping, and know the value of working in double\r\nharness. The Geotrupes couple, for instance, prepare their larva’s food\r\ntogether: the father lends his mate the assistance of his powerful\r\npress in the manufacture of the tightly packed sausage-shaped ration.\r\nHe is a splendid example of domestic habits, and one extremely\r\nsurprising amid the general egoism.\r\n\r\nTo this example my constant studies of the subject have enabled me to\r\nadd three others, all furnished by the Guild of Scavengers.\r\n\r\nOne of them is the Sisyphus, the smallest and most zealous of all our\r\npill-rollers. He is the liveliest and most agile of them all, and recks\r\nnothing of awkward somersaults and headlong falls on the impossible\r\nroads to which his obstinacy brings him back again and again. It was in\r\nreference to these wild gymnastics that Latreille gave him the name of\r\nSisyphus.\r\n\r\nAs you know, that unhappy wretch of classical fame had a terrible task.\r\nHe was forced to roll a huge stone uphill; and each time he succeeded\r\nin toiling to the top of the mountain the stone slipped from his grasp\r\nand rolled to the bottom. I like this myth. It is the history of a good\r\nmany of us. So far as I am concerned, for half a century and more I\r\nhave painfully climbed the steep ascent, spending my strength\r\nrecklessly in the struggle to hoist up to safety that crushing burden,\r\nmy daily bread. Hardly is the loaf balanced when it slips off, slides\r\ndown, and is lost in the abyss.\r\n\r\nThe Sisyphus with whom we are now concerned knows none of these bitter\r\ntrials. Untroubled by the steep slopes he gaily trundles his load, at\r\none time bread for himself, at another bread for his children. He is\r\nvery scarce in these parts; and I should never have managed to secure a\r\nsuitable number of subjects for my studies had it not been for an\r\nassistant whom I have already mentioned more than once.\r\n\r\nI speak of my little son Paul, aged seven. He is my enthusiastic\r\ncompanion on my hunting expeditions, and knows better than any one of\r\nhis age the secrets of the Cicada, the Locust, the Cricket, and\r\nespecially the Scavenger Beetle. Twenty paces away his sharp eyes will\r\ndistinguish the real mound that marks a burrow from casual heaps of\r\nearth. His delicate ears catch the Grasshopper’s faint song, which is\r\nquite unheard by me. He lends me his sight and hearing; and I, in\r\nexchange, present him with ideas, which he receives attentively.\r\n\r\nLittle Paul has his own insect-cages, in which the Sacred Beetle makes\r\npears for him; his own little garden, no larger than a\r\npocket-handkerchief, where he grows beans, often digging them up to see\r\nif the tiny roots are any longer; his forest plantation, in which stand\r\nfour oaks a hand’s-breadth high, still furnished on one side with the\r\nacorn that feeds them. It all makes a welcome change from grammar,\r\nwhich gets on none the worse for it.\r\n\r\nWhen the month of May is near at hand Paul and I get up early one\r\nmorning—so early that we start without our breakfast—and we explore, at\r\nthe foot of the mountain, the meadows where the flocks have been. Here\r\nwe find the Sisyphus. Paul is so zealous in his search that we soon\r\nhave a sufficient number of couples.\r\n\r\nAll that is needed for their well-being is a wire-gauze cover, with a\r\nbed of sand and a supply of their food—to obtain which we too turn\r\nscavengers. These creatures are so small, hardly the size of a\r\ncherry-stone! And so curious in shape withal! A dumpy body, the hinder\r\nend of which is pointed, and very long legs, resembling a Spider’s when\r\noutspread. The hind-legs are of amazing length, and are curved, which\r\nis most useful for clasping and squeezing the pellet.\r\n\r\nSoon the time comes for establishing the family. With equal zeal father\r\nand mother alike take part in kneading, carting, and stowing away the\r\nprovisions for the young ones. With the cleaver of the fore-legs a\r\nmorsel of the right size is cut from the food placed at their disposal.\r\nThe two insects work at the piece together, giving it little pats,\r\npressing it, and shaping it into a ball as large as a big pea.\r\n\r\nAs in the Sacred Beetle’s workshop, the accurately round shape is\r\nobtained without the mechanical trick of rolling the ball. The material\r\nis modelled into a sphere before it is moved, before it is even\r\nloosened from its support. Here, once more, we have an expert in\r\ngeometry familiar with the best form for preserving food.\r\n\r\nThe ball is soon ready. It must now, by vigorous rolling, be given the\r\ncrust which will protect the soft stuff within from becoming too dry.\r\nThe mother, who can be recognised by her slightly larger size,\r\nharnesses herself in the place of honour, in front. With her long\r\nhind-legs on the ground and her fore-legs on the ball, she hauls it\r\ntowards her, backwards. The father pushes behind in the reverse\r\nposition, head downwards. It is precisely the same method as that of\r\nthe Sacred Beetle when working in twos, but it has another object. The\r\nSisyphus team conveys a store of food for the grubs, whereas the big\r\npill-rollers trundle a banquet which they themselves will eat up\r\nunderground.\r\n\r\nThe couple start off along the ground. They have no definite goal, but\r\nwalk in a direct line, without regard to the obstacles that lie in the\r\nway. In this backward march the obstacles could not be avoided; but\r\neven if they were seen the Sisyphus would not try to go round them. For\r\nshe even makes obstinate attempts to climb the wire-work of my cage.\r\nThis is an arduous and impossible task. Clawing the meshes of the gauze\r\nwith her hind-legs the mother pulls the load towards her; then, putting\r\nher fore-legs round it, she holds it suspended in air. The father,\r\nfinding nothing to stand upon, clings to the ball—encrusts himself in\r\nit, so to speak, thus adding his weight to that of the lump, and taking\r\nno further pains. The effort is too great to last. The ball and its\r\nrider, forming one mass, fall to the floor. The mother, from above,\r\nlooks down for a moment in surprise, and then drops to recover the load\r\nand renew her impossible attempt to scale the side. After repeated\r\nfalls the climb is abandoned.\r\n\r\nEven on level ground the carting is not carried on without difficulty.\r\nAt every moment the load swerves on some mound made by a bit of gravel;\r\nand the team topple over and kick about, upside down. This is a trifle,\r\nthe merest trifle. These tumbles, which so often fling the Sisyphus on\r\nhis back, cause him no concern; one would even think he liked them.\r\nAfter all, the ball has to be hardened and made of the right\r\nconsistency. And this being the case, bumps falls, and jolts are all\r\npart of the programme. This mad steeple-chasing goes on for hours.\r\n\r\nAt last the mother, regarding the work as completed, goes off a little\r\nway in search of a suitable spot. The father mounts guard, squatting on\r\nthe treasure. If his companion’s absence be unduly long, he relieves\r\nhis boredom by spinning the ball nimbly between his uplifted hind legs.\r\nHe treats his precious pellet as a juggler treats his ball. He tests\r\nits perfect shape with his curved legs, the branches of his compasses.\r\nNo one who sees him frisking in that jubilant attitude can doubt his\r\nlively satisfaction—the satisfaction of a father assured of his\r\nchildren’s future.\r\n\r\n“It is I,” he seems to say, “I who kneaded this round loaf, I who made\r\nthis bread for my sons!”\r\n\r\nAnd he lifts on high, for all to see, this magnificent testimony to his\r\nindustry.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the mother has chosen a site for the burrow. A shallow pit is\r\nmade, a mere beginning of the work. The ball is rolled near it. The\r\nfather, that vigilant guardian, does not let go, while the mother digs\r\nwith her legs and forehead. Soon the hollow is big enough to hold the\r\npellet. She insists on having it quite close to her; she must feel it\r\nbobbing up and down behind her, on her back, safe from parasites,\r\nbefore she decides to go farther. She is afraid of what might happen to\r\nit if it were left on the edge of the burrow until the home were\r\ncompleted. There are plenty of Midges and other such insects to grab\r\nit. One cannot be too careful.\r\n\r\nThe ball therefore is inserted, half in and half out of the\r\npartly-formed basin. The mother, underneath, gets her legs round it and\r\npulls: the father above, lets it down gently, and sees that the hole is\r\nnot choked up with falling earth. All goes well. The digging is resumed\r\nand the descent continues, always with the same caution; one of the\r\ninsects pulling the load, the other regulating the drop and clearing\r\naway anything that might hinder the operation. A few more efforts, and\r\nthe ball disappears underground with the two miners. What follows for\r\nsome time to come can only be a repetition of what has already been\r\ndone. We must wait half a day or so.\r\n\r\nIf we keep careful watch we shall see the father come up again to the\r\nsurface by himself, and crouch in the sand near the burrow. Detained\r\nbelow by duties in which her companion can be of no assistance to her,\r\nthe mother usually postpones her appearance till the morrow. At last\r\nshe shows herself. The father leaves the place where he was snoozing,\r\nand joins her. The reunited couple go back to the spot where their\r\nfood-stuffs are to be found, and having refreshed themselves they\r\ngather up more materials. The two then set to work again. Once more\r\nthey model, cart, and store the ball together.\r\n\r\nI am delighted with this constancy. That it is really the rule I dare\r\nnot declare. There must, no doubt, be flighty, fickle Beetles. No\r\nmatter: the little I have seen gives me a high opinion of the domestic\r\nhabits of the Sisyphus.\r\n\r\nIt is time to inspect the burrow. At no great depth we find a tiny\r\nniche, just large enough to allow the mother to move round her work.\r\nThe smallness of the chamber tells us that the father cannot remain\r\nthere for long. When the studio is ready, he must go away to leave the\r\nsculptress room to turn.\r\n\r\nThe contents of the cellar consist of a single ball, a masterpiece of\r\nart. It is a copy of the Sacred Beetle’s pear on a very much reduced\r\nscale, its smallness making the polish of the surface and the elegance\r\nof the curves all the more striking. Its diameter, at the broadest\r\npoint, measures one-half to three-quarters of an inch.\r\n\r\nOne more observation about the Sisyphus. Six couples under the\r\nwire-gauze cover gave me fifty-seven pears containing one egg each—an\r\naverage of over nine grubs to each couple. The Sacred Beetle is far\r\nfrom reaching this figure. To what cause are we to attribute this large\r\nbrood? I can see but one: the fact that the father works as well as the\r\nmother. Family burdens that would exceed the strength of one are not\r\ntoo heavy when there are two to bear them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nTHE CAPRICORN\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nTHE GRUB’S HOME\r\n\r\nAn eighteenth-century philosopher, Condillac, describes an imaginary\r\nstatue, organised like a man, but with none of a man’s senses. He then\r\npictures the effect of endowing it with the five senses, one by one,\r\nand the first sense he gives it is that of smell. The statue, having no\r\nsense but smell, inhales the scent of a rose, and out of that single\r\nimpression creates a whole world of ideas. In my youth I owed some\r\nhappy moments to that statue. I seemed to see it come to life in that\r\naction of the nostrils, acquiring memory, concentration, judgment, and\r\nother mental qualities, even as still waters are aroused and rippled by\r\nthe impact of a grain of sand. I recovered from my illusion under the\r\nteaching of my abler master the animal. The Capricorn taught me that\r\nthe problem is more obscure than the Abbé Condillac led me to suppose.\r\n\r\nWhen my winter supply of firewood is being prepared for me with wedge\r\nand mallet, the woodman selects, by my express orders, the oldest and\r\nmost ravaged trunks in his stack. My tastes bring a smile to his lips;\r\nhe wonders by what whimsy I prefer wood that is worm-eaten to sound\r\nwood, which burns so much better. I have my views on the subject, and\r\nthe worthy man submits to them.\r\n\r\nA fine oak-trunk, seamed with scars and gashed with wounds, contains\r\nmany treasures for my studies. The mallet drives home, the wedges bite,\r\nthe wood splits; and within, in the dry and hollow parts, are revealed\r\ngroups of various insects who are capable of living through the cold\r\nseason, and have here taken up their winter quarters. In the low-roofed\r\ngalleries built by some Beetle the Osmia Bee has piled her cells one\r\nabove the other. In the deserted chambers and vestibules Megachiles\r\nhave arranged their leafy jars. In the live wood, filled with juicy\r\nsap, the larva of the Capricorn, the chief author of the oak’s undoing,\r\nhas set up its home.\r\n\r\nTruly they are strange creatures, these grubs: bits of intestines\r\ncrawling about! In the middle of Autumn I find them of two different\r\nages. The older are almost as thick as one’s finger; the others hardly\r\nattain the diameter of a pencil. I find, in addition, the pupa or nymph\r\nmore or less fully coloured, and the perfect insect ready to leave the\r\ntrunk when the hot weather comes again. Life inside the wood,\r\ntherefore, lasts for three years.\r\n\r\nHow is this long period of solitude and captivity spent? In wandering\r\nlazily through the thickness of the oak, in making roads whose rubbish\r\nserves as food. The horse in the book of Job “swallows the ground” in a\r\nfigure of speech: the Capricorn’s grub eats its way literally. With its\r\ncarpenter’s-gouge—a strong black mandible, short and without notches,\r\nbut scooped into a sharp-edged spoon—it digs the opening of its tunnel.\r\nFrom the piece cut out the grub extracts the scanty juices, while the\r\nrefuse accumulates behind him in heaps. The path is devoured as it is\r\nmade; it is blocked behind as it makes way ahead.\r\n\r\nSince this harsh work is done with the two gouges, the two curved\r\nchisels of the mandibles, the Capricorn-grub requires much strength in\r\nthe front part of its body, which therefore swells into a sort of\r\npestle. The Buprestis-grub, that other industrious carpenter, adopts a\r\nsimilar form, and even exaggerates its pestle. The part that toils and\r\ncarves hard wood requires to be robust; the rest of the body, which has\r\nbut to follow after, continues slim. The essential thing is that the\r\nimplement of the jaws should possess a solid support and powerful\r\nmachinery. The Capricorn larva strengthens its chisels with a stout,\r\nblack, horny armour that surrounds the mouth; yet, apart from its skull\r\nand its equipment of tools, this grub has a skin as fine as satin and\r\nas white as ivory. This dead white is caused by a thick layer of\r\ngrease, which one would not expect a diet of wood to produce in the\r\nanimal. True, it has nothing to do, at every hour of the day and night,\r\nbut gnaw. The quantity of wood that passes into its stomach makes up\r\nfor the lack of nourishing qualities.\r\n\r\nThe grub’s legs can hardly be called legs at all; they are mere\r\nsuggestions of the legs the full-grown insect will have by and by. They\r\nare infinitesimal in size, and of no use whatever for walking. They do\r\nnot even touch the supporting surface, being kept off it by the\r\nplumpness of the chest. The organs by means of which the animal\r\nprogresses are something altogether different.\r\n\r\nThe grub of the Rose-chafer, with the aid of the hairs and pad-like\r\nprojections upon its spine, manages to reverse the usual method of\r\nwalking, and to wriggle along on its back. The grub of the Capricorn is\r\neven more ingenious: it moves at the same time on its back and its\r\nstomach. To take the place of its useless legs it has a walking\r\napparatus almost like feet, which appear, contrary to every rule, on\r\nthe surface of its back.\r\n\r\nOn the middle part of its body, both above and below, there is a row of\r\nseven four-sided pads, which the grub can either expand or contract,\r\nmaking them stick out or lie flat at will. It is by means of these pads\r\nthat it walks. When it wishes to move forwards it expands the hinder\r\npads, those on the back as well as those on the stomach, and contracts\r\nits front pads. The swelling of the hind pads in the narrow gallery\r\nfills up the space, and gives the grub something to push against. At\r\nthe same time the flattening of the front pads, by decreasing the size\r\nof the grub, allows it to slip forward and take half a step. Then, to\r\ncomplete the step, the hind-quarters must be brought up the same\r\ndistance. With this object the front pads fill out and provide support,\r\nwhile those behind shrink and leave room for the grub to draw up its\r\nhind-quarters.\r\n\r\nWith the double support of its back and stomach, with alternate\r\nswellings and shrinkings, the animal easily advances or retreats along\r\nits gallery, a sort of mould which the contents fill without a gap. But\r\nif the pads grip only on one side progress becomes impossible. When\r\nplaced on the smooth wood of my table the animal wriggles slowly; it\r\nlengthens and shortens without progressing by a hair’s breadth. Laid on\r\nthe surface of a piece of split oak, a rough, uneven surface due to the\r\ngash made by the wedge, it twists and writhes, moves the front part of\r\nits body very slowly from left to right and right to left, lifts it a\r\nlittle, lowers it, and begins again. This is all it can do. The\r\nrudimentary legs remain inert and absolutely useless.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nTHE GRUB’S SENSATIONS\r\n\r\nThough the Capricorn-grub possesses these useless legs, the germs of\r\nfuture limbs, there is no sign of the eyes with which the\r\nfully-developed insect will be richly gifted. The larva has not the\r\nleast trace of any organs of sight. What would it do with sight, in the\r\nmurky thickness of a tree-trunk? Hearing is likewise absent. In the\r\nuntroubled silence of the oak’s inmost heart the sense of hearing would\r\nbe superfluous. Where sounds are lacking, of what use is the faculty of\r\ndiscerning them?\r\n\r\nTo make the matter certain I carried out some experiments. If split\r\nlengthwise the grub’s abode becomes a half-tunnel, in which I can watch\r\nthe occupant’s doings. When left alone it alternately works for a\r\nwhile, gnawing at its gallery, and rests for awhile, fixed by its pads\r\nto the two sides of the tunnel. I took advantage of these moments of\r\nrest to inquire into its power of hearing. The banging of hard bodies,\r\nthe ring of metallic objects, the grating of a file upon a saw, were\r\ntried in vain. The animal remained impassive: not a wince, not a\r\nmovement of the skin, no sign of awakened attention. I succeeded no\r\nbetter when I scratched the wood near it with a hard point, to imitate\r\nthe sound of some other grub at work in its neighbourhood. The\r\nindifference to my noisy tricks could be no greater in a lifeless\r\nobject. The animal is deaf.\r\n\r\nCan it smell? Everything tells us that it cannot. Scent is of\r\nassistance in the search for food. But the Capricorn-grub need not go\r\nin quest of eatables. It feeds on its home; it lives on the wood that\r\ngives it shelter. Nevertheless I tested it. In a log of fresh cypress\r\nwood I made a groove of the same width as that of the natural\r\ngalleries, and I placed the grub inside it. Cypress wood is strongly\r\nscented; it has the smell characteristic of most of the pine family.\r\nThis resinous scent, so strange to a grub that lives always in oak,\r\nought to vex it, to trouble it; and it should show its displeasure by\r\nsome kind of commotion, some attempt to get away. It did nothing of the\r\nkind: once it had found the right position in the groove it went to the\r\nend, as far as it could go, and made no further movement. Then I set\r\nbefore it, in its usual channel, a piece of camphor. Again no effect.\r\nCamphor was followed by naphthaline. Still no result. I do not think I\r\nam going too far when I deny the creature a sense of smell.\r\n\r\nTaste is there no doubt. But such taste! The food is without variety:\r\noak, for three years at a stretch, and nothing else. What can the\r\ngrub’s palate find to enjoy in this monotonous fare? The agreeable\r\nsensation of a fresh piece, oozing with sap; the uninteresting flavour\r\nof an over-dry piece. These, probably, are the only changes in the\r\nmeal.\r\n\r\nThere remains the sense of touch, the universal passive sense common to\r\nall live flesh that quivers under the goad of pain. The Capricorn-grub,\r\ntherefore, is limited to two senses, those of taste and touch, and both\r\nof these it possesses only in a very small degree. It is very little\r\nbetter off than Condillac’s statue. The imaginary being created by the\r\nphilosopher had one sense only, that of smell, equal in delicacy to our\r\nown; the real being, the oak-eater has two, which are inferior even\r\nwhen put together to the one sense of the statue. The latter plainly\r\nperceived the scent of a rose, and clearly distinguished it from any\r\nother.\r\n\r\nA vain wish has often come to me in my dreams: to be able to think, for\r\na few minutes, with the brain of my Dog, or to see the world with the\r\neyes of a Gnat. How things would change in appearance! But they would\r\nchange much more if understood only with the intellect of the grub.\r\nWhat has that incomplete creature learnt through its senses of touch\r\nand taste? Very little; almost nothing. It knows that the best bits of\r\nwood have a special kind of flavour, and that the sides of a passage,\r\nwhen not carefully smoothed, are painful to the skin. This is the limit\r\nof its wisdom. In comparison with this, the statue with the sensitive\r\nnostrils was a marvel of knowledge. It remembered, compared, judged,\r\nand reasoned. Can the Capricorn-grub remember? Can it reason? I\r\ndescribed it a little time ago as a bit of intestine that crawls about.\r\nThis description gives an answer to these questions. The grub has the\r\nsensations of a bit of intestine, no more and no less.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nTHE GRUB’S FORESIGHT\r\n\r\nAnd this half-alive object, this nothing-at-all, is capable of\r\nmarvellous foresight. It knows hardly anything of the present, but it\r\nsees very clearly into the future.\r\n\r\nFor three years on end the larva wanders about in the heart of the\r\ntrunk. It goes up, goes down, turns to this side and that; it leaves\r\none vein for another of better flavour, but without ever going too far\r\nfrom the inner depths, where the temperature is milder than near the\r\nsurface, and greater safety reigns. But a day is at hand when the\r\nhermit must leave its safe retreat and face the perils of the outer\r\nworld. Eating is not everything, after all; we have to get out of this.\r\n\r\nBut how? For the grub, before leaving the trunk, must turn into a\r\nlong-horned Beetle. And though the grub, being well equipped with tools\r\nand muscular strength, finds no difficulty in boring through the wood\r\nand going where it pleases, it by no means follows that the coming\r\nCapricorn has the same powers. The Beetle’s short spell of life must be\r\nspent in the open air. Will it be able to clear itself a way of escape?\r\n\r\nIt is quite plain, at all events, that the Capricorn will be absolutely\r\nunable to make use of the tunnel bored by the grub. This tunnel is a\r\nvery long and very irregular maze, blocked with great heaps of wormed\r\nwood. It grows constantly smaller and smaller as it approaches the\r\nstarting-point, because the larva entered the trunk as slim as a tiny\r\nbit of straw, whereas to-day it is as thick as one’s finger. In its\r\nthree years’ wanderings it always dug its gallery to fit the size of\r\nits body. Evidently the road of the larva cannot be the Capricorn’s way\r\nout. His overgrown antennæ, his long legs, his inflexible armour-plates\r\nwould find the narrow, winding corridor impassable. The passage would\r\nhave to be cleared of its wormed wood, and, moreover, greatly enlarged.\r\nIt would be easier to attack the untouched timber and dig straight\r\nahead. Is the insect capable of doing so? I determined to find out.\r\n\r\nI made some cavities of suitable size in some oak logs that had been\r\nchopped in two, and in each of these cells I placed a Capricorn that\r\nhad just been transformed from the grub. I then joined the two sides of\r\nthe logs, fastening them together with wire. When June came I heard a\r\nsound of scraping inside the logs, and waited anxiously to see if the\r\nCapricorns would appear. They had hardly three-quarters of an inch to\r\npierce. Yet not one came out. On opening the logs I found all my\r\ncaptives dead. A pinch of sawdust represented all they had done.\r\n\r\nI had expected more from their sturdy mandibles. In spite of their\r\nboring-tools the hermits died for lack of skill. I tried enclosing some\r\nin reed-stumps, but even this comparatively easy work was too much for\r\nthem. Some freed themselves, but others failed.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding his stalwart appearance the Capricorn cannot leave the\r\ntree-trunk by his own unaided efforts. The truth is that his way is\r\nprepared for him by the grub—that bit of intestine.\r\n\r\nSome presentiment—to us an unfathomable mystery—causes the\r\nCapricorn-grub to leave its peaceful stronghold in the very heart of\r\nthe oak and wriggle towards the outside, where its foe the Woodpecker\r\nis quite likely to gobble it up. At the risk of its life it stubbornly\r\ndigs and gnaws to the very bark. It leaves only the thinnest film, the\r\nslenderest screen, between itself and the world at large. Sometimes,\r\neven, the rash one opens the doorway wide.\r\n\r\nThis is the Capricorn’s way out. The insect has but to file the screen\r\na little with his mandibles, to bump against it with his forehead, in\r\norder to bring it down. He will even have nothing at all to do when the\r\ndoorway is open, as often happens. The unskilled carpenter, burdened\r\nwith his extravagant head-dress, will come out from the darkness\r\nthrough this opening when the summer heat arrives.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the grub has attended to the important business of making a\r\ndoorway into the world, it begins to busy itself with its\r\ntransformation into a Beetle. First, it requires space for the purpose.\r\nSo it retreats some distance down its gallery, and in the side of the\r\npassage digs itself a transformation-chamber more sumptuously furnished\r\nand barricaded than any I have ever seen. It is a roomy hollow with\r\ncurved walls, three to four inches in length and wider than it is high.\r\nThe width of the cell gives the insect a certain degree of freedom of\r\nmovement when the time comes for forcing the barricade, which is more\r\nthan a close-fitting case would do.\r\n\r\nThe barricade—a door which the larva builds as a protection from\r\ndanger—is twofold, and often threefold. Outside, it is a stack of woody\r\nrefuse, of particles of chopped timber; inside, a mineral lid, a\r\nconcave cover, all in one piece, of a chalky white. Pretty often, but\r\nnot always, there is added to these two layers an inner casing of\r\nshavings.\r\n\r\nBehind this threefold door the larva makes its arrangements for its\r\ntransformation. The sides of the chamber are scraped, thus providing a\r\nsort of down formed of ravelled woody fibres, broken into tiny shreds.\r\nThis velvety stuff is fixed on the wall, in a thick coating, as fast as\r\nit is made. The chamber is thus padded throughout with a fine\r\nswan’s-down, a delicate precaution taken by the rough grub out of\r\nkindness for the tender creature it will become when it has cast its\r\nskin.\r\n\r\nLet us now go back to the most curious part of the furnishing, the\r\ncover or inner door of the entrance. It is like an oval skull-cap,\r\nwhite and hard as chalk, smooth within and rough without, with some\r\nresemblance to an acorn-cup. The rough knots show that the material is\r\nsupplied in small, pasty mouthfuls, which become solid outside in\r\nlittle lumps. The animal does not remove them, because it is unable to\r\nget at them; but the inside surface is polished, being within the\r\ngrub’s reach. This singular lid is as hard and brittle as a flake of\r\nlimestone. It is, as a matter of fact, composed solely of carbonate of\r\nlime, and a sort of cement which gives consistency to the chalky paste.\r\n\r\nI am convinced that this stony deposit comes from a particular part of\r\nthe grub’s stomach, called the chylific ventricle. The chalk is kept\r\nseparate from the food, and is held in reserve until the right time\r\ncomes to discharge it. This freestone factory causes me no\r\nastonishment. It serves for various chemical works in different grubs\r\nwhen undergoing transformation. Certain Oil-beetles keep refuse in it,\r\nand several kinds of Wasps use it to manufacture the shellac with which\r\nthey varnish the silk of their cocoons.\r\n\r\nWhen the exit way is prepared, and the cell upholstered in velvet and\r\nclosed with a threefold barricade, the industrious grub has finished\r\nits task. It lays aside its tools, sheds its skin, and becomes a\r\npupa—weakness personified, in the swaddling-clothes of a cocoon. The\r\nhead is always turned towards the door. This is a trifling detail in\r\nappearance; but in reality it is everything. To lie this way or that in\r\nthe long cell is a matter of great indifference to the grub, which is\r\nvery supple, turning easily in its narrow lodging and adopting whatever\r\nposition it pleases. The coming Capricorn will not enjoy the same\r\nprivileges. Stiffly encased in his horny armour, he will not be able to\r\nturn from end to end; he will not even be capable of bending, if some\r\nsudden curve should make the passage difficult. He must, without fail,\r\nfind the door in front of him, or he will perish in the\r\ntransformation-room. If the grub should forget this little matter, and\r\nlie down to sleep with its head at the back of the cell, the Capricorn\r\nwould be infallibly lost. His cradle would become a hopeless dungeon.\r\n\r\nBut there is no fear of this danger. The “bit of intestine” knows too\r\nmuch about the future to neglect the formality of keeping its head at\r\nthe door. At the end of spring the Capricorn, now in possession of his\r\nfull strength, dreams of the joys of the sun, of the festivals of\r\nlight. He wants to get out.\r\n\r\nWhat does he find before him? First, a heap of filings easily dispersed\r\nwith his claws; next, a stone lid which he need not even break into\r\nfragments, for it comes undone in one piece. It is removed from its\r\nframe with a few pushes of the forehead, a few tugs of the claws. In\r\nfact, I find the lid intact on the threshold of the abandoned cell.\r\nLast comes a second mass of woody remnants as easy to scatter as the\r\nfirst. The road is now free: the Capricorn has but to follow the wide\r\nvestibule, which will lead him, without any possibility of mistake, to\r\nthe outer exit. Should the doorway not be open, all that he has to do\r\nis to gnaw through a thin screen, an easy task. Behold him outside, his\r\nlong antennæ quivering with excitement.\r\n\r\nWhat have we learnt from him? Nothing from him, but much from his grub.\r\nThis grub, so poor in organs of sensation, gives us much to think\r\nabout. It knows that the coming Beetle will not be able to cut himself\r\na road through the oak, and it therefore opens one for him at its own\r\nrisk and peril. It knows that the Capricorn, in his stiff armour, will\r\nnever be able to turn round and make for the opening of the cell; and\r\nit takes care to fall into its sleep of transformation with its head\r\ntowards the door. It knows how soft the pupa’s flesh will be, and it\r\nupholsters the bedroom with velvet. It knows that the enemy is likely\r\nto break in during the slow work of the transformation, and so, to make\r\na protection against attack, it stores lime inside its stomach. It\r\nknows the future with a clear vision, or, to be accurate, it behaves as\r\nif it knew the future.\r\n\r\nWhat makes it act in this way? It is certainly not taught by the\r\nexperiences of its senses. What does it know of the outside world? I\r\nrepeat—as much as a bit of intestine can know. And this senseless\r\ncreature astounds us! I regret that the philosopher Condillac, instead\r\nof creating a statue that could smell a rose, did not gift it with an\r\ninstinct. How soon he would have seen that the animals—including\r\nman—have powers quite apart from the senses; inspirations that are born\r\nwith them, and are not the result of learning.\r\n\r\nThis curious life and this marvellous foresight are not confined to one\r\nkind of grub. Besides the Capricorn of the Oak there is the Capricorn\r\nof the Cherry-tree. In appearance the latter is an exact copy of the\r\nformer, on a much smaller scale; but the little Capricorn has different\r\ntastes from its large kinsman’s. If we search the heart of the\r\ncherry-tree it does not show us a single grub anywhere: the entire\r\npopulation lives between the bark and the wood. This habit is only\r\nvaried when transformation is at hand. Then the grub of the cherry-tree\r\nleaves the surface, and scoops out a cavity at a depth of about two\r\ninches. Here the walls are bare: they are not lined with the velvety\r\nfibres dear to the Capricorn of the Oak. The entrance is blocked,\r\nhowever, by sawdust, and a chalky lid similar to the other except in\r\npoint of size. Need I add that the grub lies down and goes to sleep\r\nwith his head against the door? Not one forgets to take this\r\nprecaution.\r\n\r\nThere is also a Saperda of the Poplar and a Saperda of the Cherry-tree.\r\nThey have the same organisation and the same tools; but the former\r\nfollows the methods of the Capricorn of the Oak, while the latter\r\nimitates the Capricorn of the Cherry-tree.\r\n\r\nThe poplar-tree is also inhabited by the Bronze Buprestis, which takes\r\nno defensive measures before going to sleep. It makes no barricade, no\r\nheap of shavings. And in the apricot-tree the Nine-spotted Buprestis\r\nbehaves in the same way. In this case the grub is inspired by its\r\nintuitions to alter its plan of work to suit the coming Beetle. The\r\nperfect insect is a cylinder; the grub is a strap, a ribbon. The\r\nformer, which wears unyielding armour, needs a cylindrical passage; the\r\nlatter needs a very low tunnel, with a roof that it can reach with the\r\npads on its back. The grub therefore changes its manner of boring:\r\nyesterday the gallery, suited to a wandering life in the thickness of\r\nthe wood, was a wide burrow with a very low ceiling, almost a slot;\r\nto-day the passage is cylindrical. A gimlet could not bore it more\r\naccurately. This sudden change in the system of roadmaking on behalf of\r\nthe coming insect once more shows us the foresight of this “bit of\r\nintestine.”\r\n\r\nI could tell you of many other wood-eaters. Their tools are the same;\r\nyet each species displays special methods, tricks of the trade that\r\nhave nothing to do with the tools. These grubs, then, like so many\r\ninsects, show us that instinct is not made by the tools, so to speak,\r\nbut that the same tools may be used in various ways.\r\n\r\nTo continue the subject would be monotonous. The general rule stands\r\nout very clearly from these facts: the wood-eating grubs prepare the\r\npath of deliverance for the perfect insect, which will merely have to\r\npass a barricade of shavings or pierce a screen of bark. By a curious\r\nreversal of the usual state of things, infancy is here the season of\r\nenergy, of strong tools, of stubborn work; mature age is the season of\r\nleisure, of industrial ignorance, of idle diversions, without trade or\r\nprofession. The providence of the human infant is the mother; here the\r\nbaby grub is the mother’s providence. With its patient tooth, which\r\nneither the peril of the outside world nor the difficult task of boring\r\nthrough hard wood is able to discourage, it clears away for her to the\r\nsupreme delights of the sun.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nLOCUSTS\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nTHEIR VALUE\r\n\r\n“Mind you’re ready, children, to-morrow morning before the sun gets too\r\nhot. We’re going Locust-hunting.”\r\n\r\nThis announcement throws the household into great excitement at\r\nbed-time. What do my little helpers see in their dreams? Blue wings,\r\nred wings, suddenly flung out like fans; long saw-toothed legs, pale\r\nblue or pink, which kick out when we hold their owners in our fingers;\r\ngreat shanks that act like springs, and make the insect leap forward as\r\nthough shot from a catapult.\r\n\r\nIf there be one peaceful and safe form of hunting, one in which both\r\nold age and childhood can share, it is Locust-hunting. What delicious\r\nmornings we owe to it! How delightful, when the mulberries are ripe, to\r\npick them from the bushes! What excursions we have had, on the slopes\r\ncovered with thin, tough grass, burnt yellow by the sun! I have vivid\r\nmemories of such mornings, and my children will have them too.\r\n\r\nLittle Paul has nimble legs, a ready hand, and a piercing eye. He\r\ninspects the clumps of everlastings, and peers closely into the bushes.\r\nSuddenly a big Grey Locust flies out like a little bird. The hunter\r\nfirst makes off at full speed, then stops and gazes in wonder at this\r\nmock Swallow flying far away. He will have better luck another time. We\r\nshall not go home without a few of those magnificent prizes.\r\n\r\nMarie Pauline, who is younger than her brother, watches patiently for\r\nthe Italian Locust, with his pink wings and carmine hind-legs; but she\r\nreally prefers another, the most ornamented of them all. Her favourite\r\nwears a St. Andrew’s cross on the small of his back, which is marked by\r\nfour white, slanting stripes. He wears, too, patches of green, the\r\ncolour of verdigris on bronze. With her hand raised in the air, ready\r\nto swoop down, she approaches very softly, stooping low. Whoosh! That’s\r\ndone it! The treasure is quickly thrust head-first into a paper funnel,\r\nand plunges with one bound to the bottom of it.\r\n\r\nOne by one our boxes are filled. Before the heat becomes too great to\r\nbear we are in possession of a number of specimens. Imprisoned in my\r\ncages, perhaps they will teach us something. In any case the Locusts\r\nhave given pleasure to three people at a small cost.\r\n\r\nLocusts have a bad reputation, I know. The textbooks describe them as\r\nnoxious. I take the liberty of doubting whether they deserve this\r\nreproach, except, of course, in the case of the terrible ravagers who\r\nare the scourge of Africa and the East. Their ill repute has been\r\nfastened on all Locusts, though they are, I consider, more useful than\r\nharmful. As far as I know, our peasants have never complained of them.\r\nWhat damage do they do?\r\n\r\nThey nibble the tops of the tough grasses which the Sheep refuses to\r\ntouch; they prefer the thin, poor grass to the fat pastures; they\r\nbrowse on barren land that can support none but them; they live on food\r\nthat no stomach but theirs could use.\r\n\r\nBesides, by the time they frequent the fields the green wheat—the only\r\nthing that might tempt them—has long ago yielded its grain and\r\ndisappeared. If they happen to get into the kitchen-gardens and take a\r\nfew bites, it is not a crime. A man can console himself for a piece\r\nbitten out of a leaf or two of salad.\r\n\r\nTo measure the importance of things by one’s own turnip-patch is a\r\nhorrible method. The short-sighted man would upset the order of the\r\nuniverse rather than sacrifice a dozen plums. If he thinks of the\r\ninsect at all, it is only to kill it.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, think what the consequences would be if all the Locusts were\r\nkilled. In September and October the Turkeys are driven into the\r\nstubble, under charge of a child armed with two long reeds. The expanse\r\nover which the gobbling flock slowly spreads is bare, dry, and burnt by\r\nthe sun. At the most, a few ragged thistles raise their heads. What do\r\nthe birds do in this famine-stricken desert? They cram themselves, that\r\nthey may do honour to the Christmas table; they wax fat; their flesh\r\nbecomes firm and good to eat. And pray, what do they cram themselves\r\nwith? With Locusts. They snap them up, one here one there, till their\r\ngreedy crops are filled with the delicious stuffing, which costs\r\nnothing, though its rich flavour will greatly improve the Christmas\r\nTurkey.\r\n\r\nWhen the Guinea-fowl roams about the farm, uttering her rasping cry,\r\nwhat is it she seeks? Seeds, no doubt; but above all Locusts, which\r\npuff her out under the wings with a pad of fat, and give a better\r\nflavour to her flesh. The Hen, too, much to our advantage, is just as\r\nfond of them. She well knows the virtues of that dainty dish, which\r\nacts as a tonic and makes her lay more eggs. When left at liberty she\r\nrarely fails to lead her family to the stubble-fields, so that they may\r\nlearn to snap up the nice mouthful skilfully. In fact, every bird in\r\nthe poultry-yard finds the Locust a valuable addition to his bill of\r\nfare.\r\n\r\nIt is still more important outside the poultry-yard. Any who is a\r\nsportsman, and knows the value of the Red-legged Patridge, the glory of\r\nour southern hills, should open the crop of the bird he has just shot.\r\nHe will find it, nine times out of ten, more or less crammed with\r\nLocusts. The Partridge dotes on them, preferring them to seeds as long\r\nas he can catch them. This highly-flavoured, nourishing fare would\r\nalmost make him forget the existence of seeds, if it were only there\r\nall the year round.\r\n\r\nThe Wheat-ear, too, who is so good to eat, prefers the Locust to any\r\nother food. And all the little birds of passage which, when autumn\r\ncomes, call a halt in Provence before their great pilgrimage, fatten\r\nthemselves with Locusts as a preparation for the journey.\r\n\r\nNor does man himself scorn them. An Arab author tells us:\r\n\r\n“Grasshoppers”—(he means Locusts)—“are of good nourishment for men and\r\nCamels. Their claws, wings, and head are taken away, and they are eaten\r\nfresh or dried, either roast or boiled, and served with flesh, flour,\r\nand herbs.\r\n\r\n”... Camels eat them greedily, and are given them dried or roast,\r\nheaped in a hollow between two layers of charcoal. Thus also do the\r\nNubians eat them....\r\n\r\n“Once, when the Caliph Omar was asked if it were lawful to eat\r\nGrasshoppers, he made answer:\r\n\r\n”’Would that I had a basket of them to eat.’\r\n\r\n“Wherefore, from this testimony, it is very sure that, by the Grace of\r\nGod, Grasshoppers were given to man for his nourishment.”\r\n\r\nWithout going as far as the Arab I feel prepared to say that the Locust\r\nis a gift of God to a multitude of birds. Reptiles also hold him in\r\nesteem. I have found him in the stomach of the Eyed Lizard, and have\r\noften caught the little Grey Lizard of the walls in the act of carrying\r\nhim off.\r\n\r\nEven the fish revel in him, when good fortune brings him to them. The\r\nLocust leaps blindly, and without definite aim: he comes down wherever\r\nhe is shot by the springs in his legs. If the place where he falls\r\nhappens to be water, a fish gobbles him up at once. Anglers sometimes\r\nbait their hooks with a specially attractive Locust.\r\n\r\nAs for his being fit nourishment for man, except in the form of\r\nPartridge and young Turkey, I am a little doubtful. Omar, the mighty\r\nCaliph who destroyed the library of Alexandria, wished for a basket of\r\nLocusts, it is true, but his digestion was evidently better than his\r\nbrains. Long before his day St. John the Baptist lived in the desert on\r\nLocusts and wild honey; but in his case they were not eaten because\r\nthey were good.\r\n\r\nWild honey from the pots of the Mason-bees is very agreeable food, I\r\nknow. Wishing to taste the Locust also I once caught some, and had them\r\ncooked as the Arab author advised. We all of us, big and little, tried\r\nthe queer dish at dinner. It was much nicer than the Cicadæ praised by\r\nAristotle. I would go to the length of saying it is good—without,\r\nhowever, feeling any desire for more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nTHEIR MUSICAL TALENT\r\n\r\nThe Locust possesses musical powers wherewith to express his joys.\r\nConsider him at rest, blissfully digesting his meal and enjoying the\r\nsunshine. With sharp strokes of the bow, three or four times repeated\r\nwith a pause between, he plays his tune. He scrapes his sides with his\r\ngreat hind-legs, using now one, now the other, and now both at a time.\r\n\r\nThe result is very poor, so slight indeed that I am obliged to make use\r\nof little Paul’s sharp ear to make sure that there is a sound at all.\r\nSuch as it is, it is like the squeaking of a needle-point pushed across\r\na sheet of paper. There you have the whole song, which is very nearly\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\nWe can expect no more than this from the Locust’s very unfinished\r\ninstrument. There is nothing here like the Cricket’s toothed bow and\r\nsounding-board. The lower edge of the wing-cases is rubbed by the\r\nthighs, but though both wing-cases and thighs are powerful they have no\r\nroughnesses to supply friction, and there is no sign of teeth.\r\n\r\nThis artless attempt at a musical instrument can produce no more sound\r\nthan a dry membrane will emit when you rub it yourself. And for the\r\nsake of this small result the insect lifts and lowers its thigh in\r\nsharp jerks, and appears perfectly satisfied. It rubs its sides very\r\nmuch as we rub our hands together in sign of contentment, with no\r\nintention of making a sound. That is its own particular way of\r\nexpressing its joy in life.\r\n\r\nObserve the Locust when the sky is partly covered with clouds, and the\r\nsun shines only at times. There comes a rift in the clouds. At once the\r\nthighs begin to scrape, becoming more and more active as the sun grows\r\nhotter. The strains are brief, but they are repeated as long as the\r\nsunshine continues. The sky becomes overcast. Then and there the song\r\nceases; but is renewed with the next gleam of sunlight, always in brief\r\noutburst. There is no mistaking it: here, in these fond lovers of the\r\nlight, we have a mere expression of happiness. The Locust has his\r\nmoments of gaiety when his crop is full and the sun is kind.\r\n\r\nNot all the Locusts indulge in this joyous rubbing.\r\n\r\nThe Tryxalis, who has a pair of immensely long hind-legs, keeps up a\r\ngloomy silence when even the sunshine is brightest. I have never seen\r\nhim move his shanks like a bow; he seems unable to use them—so long are\r\nthey—for anything but hopping.\r\n\r\nThe big Grey Locust, who often visits me in the enclosure, even in the\r\ndepth of winter, is also dumb in consequence of the excessive length of\r\nhis legs. But he has a peculiar way of diverting himself. In calm\r\nweather, when the sun is hot, I surprise him in the rosemary bushes\r\nwith his wings unfurled and fluttering rapidly, as though for flight.\r\nHe keeps up this performance for a quarter of an hour at a time. His\r\nfluttering is so gentle, in spite of its extreme speed, that it creates\r\nhardly any rustling sound.\r\n\r\nOthers are still worse off. One of these is the Pedestrian Locust, who\r\nstrolls on foot on the ridges of the Ventoux amid sheets of Alpine\r\nflowers, silvery, white, and rosy. His colouring is as fresh as that of\r\nthe flowers. The sunlight, which is clearer on those heights than it is\r\nbelow, has made him a costume combining beauty with simplicity. His\r\nbody is pale brown above and yellow below, his big thighs are coral\r\nred, his hind-legs a glorious azure-blue, with an ivory anklet in\r\nfront. But in spite of being such a dandy he wears too short a coat.\r\n\r\nHis wing-cases are merely wrinkled slips, and his wings no more than\r\nstumps. He is hardly covered as far as the waist. Any one seeing him\r\nfor the first time takes him for a larva, but he is indeed the\r\nfull-grown insect, and he will wear this incomplete garment to the end.\r\n\r\nWith this skimpy jacket of course, music is impossible to him. The big\r\nthighs are there; but there are no wing-cases, no grating edge for the\r\nbow to rub upon. The other Locusts cannot be described as noisy, but\r\nthis one is absolutely dumb. In vain have the most delicate ears\r\nlistened with all their might. This silent one must have other means of\r\nexpressing his joys. What they are I do not know.\r\n\r\nNor do I know why the insect remains without wings, a plodding\r\nwayfarer, when his near kinsmen on the same Alpine slopes have\r\nexcellent means of flying. He possesses the beginnings of wings and\r\nwing-cases, gifts inherited by the larva; but he does not develop these\r\nbeginnings and make use of them. He persists in hopping, with no\r\nfurther ambition: he is satisfied to go on foot, to remain a Pedestrian\r\nLocust, when he might, one would think, acquire wings. To flit rapidly\r\nfrom crest to crest, over valleys deep in snow, to fly from one pasture\r\nto another, would certainly be great advantages to him. His\r\nfellow-dwellers on the mountain-tops possess wings and are all the\r\nbetter for them. It would be very profitable to extract from their\r\nsheaths the sails he keeps packed away in useless stumps; and he does\r\nnot do it. Why?\r\n\r\nNo one knows why. Anatomy has these puzzles, these surprises, these\r\nsudden leaps, which defy our curiosity. In the presence of such\r\nprofound problems the best thing is to bow in all humility, and pass\r\non.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nTHEIR EARLY DAYS\r\n\r\nThe Locust mother is not, in all cases, a model of affection. The\r\nItalian Locust, having laboriously half-buried herself in the sand,\r\nlays her eggs there and immediately bounds away. She gives not a look\r\nat the eggs, nor makes the least attempt to cover the hole where they\r\nlie. It closes of its own accord, as best it can, by the natural\r\nfalling-in of the sand. It is an extremely casual performance, marked\r\nby an utter absence of maternal care.\r\n\r\nOthers do not forsake their eggs so recklessly. The ordinary Locust\r\nwith the blue-and-black wings, for instance, after leaving her eggs in\r\nthe sand, lifts her hind-legs high, sweeps some sand into the hole, and\r\npresses it down by stamping it rapidly. It is a pretty sight to watch\r\nthe swift action of her slender legs, giving alternate kicks to the\r\nopening they are plugging. With this lively trampling the entrance to\r\nthe home is closed and hidden away. The hole that contains the eggs\r\ncompletely disappears, so that no ill-intentioned creature could find\r\nit by sight alone.\r\n\r\nNor is this all. The power that works the two rammers lies in the\r\nhinder thighs, which, as they rise and fall, scrape lightly against the\r\nedge of the wing-cases. This scraping produces a faint sound, similar\r\nto that with which the insect placidly lulls itself to sleep in the\r\nsun.\r\n\r\nThe Hen salutes with a song of gladness the egg she just laid; she\r\nannounces her performance to the whole neighbourhood. The Locust\r\ncelebrates the same event with her thin scraper. “I have buried\r\nunderground,” she says, “the treasure of the future.”\r\n\r\nHaving made the nest safe she leaves the spot, refreshes herself after\r\nher exertions with a few mouthfuls of green stuff, and prepares to\r\nbegin again.\r\n\r\nThe Grey Locust mother is armed at the tip of her body—and so are other\r\nfemale Locusts in varying degrees—with four short tools, arranged in\r\npairs and shaped like a hooked fingernail. On the upper pair, which are\r\nlarger than the others, these hooks are turned upwards; on the lower\r\nand smaller pair they are turned downwards. They form a sort of claw,\r\nand are scooped out slightly, like a spoon. These are the pick-axes,\r\nthe boring-tools with which the Grey Locust works. With these she bites\r\ninto the soil, lifting the dry earth a little, as quietly as if she\r\nwere digging in soft mould. She might be working in butter; and yet\r\nwhat the bore digs into is hard, unyielding earth.\r\n\r\nThe best site for laying the eggs is not always found at the first\r\nattempt. I have seen the mother make five wells one after the other\r\nbefore finding a suitable place. When at last the business is over, and\r\nthe insect begins to rise from the hole in which she is partly buried,\r\none can see that she is covering her eggs with milk-white foam, similar\r\nto that of the Mantis.\r\n\r\nThis foamy matter often forms a button at the entrance to the well, a\r\nknot which stands up and attracts the eye by its whiteness against the\r\ngrey background of the soil. It is soft and sticky, but hardens pretty\r\nsoon. When this closing button is finished the mother moves away and\r\ntroubles no more about her eggs, of which she lays a fresh batch\r\nelsewhere after a few days.\r\n\r\nSometimes the foamy paste does not reach the surface; it stops some way\r\ndown, and before long is covered with the sand that slips from the\r\nedge. But in the case of my Locusts in captivity I always know, even\r\nwhen it is concealed, exactly where the barrel of eggs lies. Its\r\nstructure is always the same, though there are variations in detail. It\r\nis always a sheath of solidified foam. Inside, there is nothing but\r\nfoam and eggs. The eggs all lie in the lower portion, packed one on top\r\nof another; and the upper part consists only of soft, yielding foam.\r\nThis portion plays an important part when the young larvæ are hatched.\r\nI will call it the ascending-shaft.\r\n\r\nThe wonderful egg-casket of the Mantis is not the result of any special\r\ntalent which the mother can exercise at will. It is due to mechanism.\r\nIt happens of itself. In the same way the Locusts have no industry of\r\ntheir own, especially devised for laying eggs in a keg of froth. The\r\nfoam is produced with the eggs, and the arrangement of eggs at the\r\nbottom and centre, and froth on the outside and the top, is purely\r\nmechanical.\r\n\r\nThere are many Locusts whose egg-cases have to last through the winter,\r\nsince they do not open until the fine weather returns. Though the soil\r\nis loose and dusty at first, it becomes caked together by the winter\r\nrains. Supposing that the hatching takes place a couple of inches below\r\nthe surface, how is this crust, this hard ceiling, to be broken? How is\r\nthe larva to come up from below? The mother’s unconscious art has\r\narranged for that.\r\n\r\nThe young Locust finds above him, when he comes out of the egg, not\r\nrough sand and hardened earth, but a straight tunnel, with solid walls\r\nthat keep all difficulties away. This ascending-shaft is full of foam,\r\nwhich the larva can easily penetrate, and which will bring him quite\r\nclose to the surface. Here only a finger’s-breadth of serious work\r\nremains to be done.\r\n\r\nThe greater part of the journey, therefore, is accomplished without\r\neffort. Though the Locust’s building is done quite mechanically,\r\nwithout the least intelligence, it is certainly singularly well\r\ndevised.\r\n\r\nThe little creature has now to complete his deliverance. On leaving his\r\nshell he is of a whitish colour, clouded with light red. His progress\r\nis made by worm-like movements; and, so that it may be as easy as\r\npossible, he is hatched, like the young Grasshopper, in a temporary\r\njacket which keeps his antennæ and legs closely fixed to his body. Like\r\nthe White-faced Decticus he keeps his boring-tool at his neck. Here\r\nthere is a kind of tumour that swells and subsides alternately, and\r\nstrikes the obstacle before it as regularly as a piston. When I see\r\nthis soft bladder trying to overcome the hardness of the earth I come\r\nto the unhappy creature’s aid, and damp the layer of soil.\r\n\r\nEven then the work is terribly hard. How it must labour, the poor\r\nlittle thing, how it must persevere with its throbbing head and\r\nwrithing loins, before it can clear a passage for itself! The wee\r\nmite’s efforts show us plainly that the journey to the light of day is\r\nan enormous undertaking, in which the greater number would die but for\r\nthe help of the exit-tunnel, the mother’s work.\r\n\r\nWhen the tiny insect reaches the surface at last, it rests for a moment\r\nto recover from all that fatigue. Then suddenly the blister swells and\r\nthrobs, and the temporary jacket splits. The rags are pushed back by\r\nthe hind-legs, which are the last to be stripped. The thing is done:\r\nthe creature is free, pale in colouring as yet, but possessing its\r\nfinal form as a larva.\r\n\r\nImmediately the hind-legs, hitherto stretched in a straight line, fall\r\ninto the correct position. The legs fold under the great thighs, and\r\nthe spring is ready to work. It works, Little Locust makes his entrance\r\ninto the world, and hops for the first time. I offer him a bit of\r\nlettuce the size of my fingernail. He refuses it. Before taking\r\nnourishment he must first mature and grow in the sun.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nTHEIR FINAL CHANGE\r\n\r\nI have just beheld a stirring sight: the last change of a Locust, the\r\nfull-grown insect emerging from his larval skin. It is magnificent. The\r\nobject of my enthusiasm is the Grey Locust, the giant who is so common\r\non the vines at vintage-time, in September. On account of his size—he\r\nis as long as my finger—he is easier to observe than any other of his\r\ntribe. The event took place in one of my cages.\r\n\r\nThe fat, ungraceful larva, a rough sketch of the perfect insect, is\r\nusually pale green; but some are blue-green, dirty yellow, red-brown,\r\nor even ashen-grey, like the grey of the full-grown Locust. The\r\nhind-legs, which are as powerful as those of mature age, have a great\r\nhaunch striped with red and a long shank shaped like a two-edged saw.\r\n\r\nThe wing-cases are at present two skimpy, triangular pinions, of which\r\nthe free ends stand up like pointed gables. These two coat-tails, of\r\nwhich the material seems to have been clipped short with ridiculous\r\nmeanness, just cover the creature’s nakedness at the small of the back,\r\nand shelter two lean strips, the germs of the wings. In brief, the\r\nsumptuous slender sails of the near future are at present sheer rags,\r\nof such meagre size as to be grotesque. From these miserable envelopes\r\nthere will come a marvel of stately elegance.\r\n\r\nThe first thing to be done is to burst the old tunic. All along the\r\ncorselet of the insect there is a line that is weaker than the rest of\r\nthe skin. Waves of blood can be seen throbbing within, rising and\r\nfalling alternately, distending the skin until at last it splits at the\r\nline of least resistance, and opens as though the two symmetrical\r\nhalves had been soldered. The split is continued some little way back,\r\nand runs between the fastenings of the wings: it goes up the head as\r\nfar as the base of the antennæ, where it sends a short branch to right\r\nand left.\r\n\r\nThrough this break the back is seen, quite soft, pale, hardly tinged\r\nwith grey. Slowly it swells into a larger and larger hunch. At last it\r\nis wholly released. The head follows, pulled out of its mask, which\r\nremains in its place, intact in the smallest particular, but looking\r\nstrange with its great eyes that do not see. The sheaths of the\r\nantennæ, without a wrinkle, with nothing out of order, and with their\r\nusual position unchanged, hang over this dead face, which is now half\r\ntransparent.\r\n\r\nThis means that the antennæ within, although fitted into narrow sheaths\r\nthat enclose them as precisely as gloves, are able to withdraw without\r\ndisturbing the covers in the smallest degree, or even wrinkling them.\r\nThe contents manage to slip out as easily as a smooth, straight object\r\ncould slip from a loose sheath. This mechanism is even more remarkable\r\nin the case of the hind-legs.\r\n\r\nNow it is the turn of the fore-legs and intermediary legs to shed their\r\narmlets and gauntlets, always without the least rent, however small,\r\nwithout a crease of rumpled material, or a trace of any change in the\r\nnatural position. The insect is now fixed to the top of the cage only\r\nby the claws of the long hind-legs. It hangs perpendicularly by four\r\ntiny hooks, head downwards, and it swings like a pendulum if I touch\r\nthe wire-gauze.\r\n\r\nThe wing-cases and wings now emerge. These are four narrow strips,\r\nfaintly grooved and looking like bits of paper ribbon. At this stage\r\nthey are scarcely a quarter of their final length. They are so limp\r\nthat they bend under their own weight and sprawl along the insect’s\r\nsides in the wrong direction, with their points towards the head of the\r\nLocust. Imagine four blades of thick grass, bent and battered by a\r\nrain-storm, and you will have a fair picture of the pitiable bunch\r\nformed by the future wings.\r\n\r\nThe hind-legs are next released. The great thighs appear, tinted on\r\ntheir inner surface with pale pink, which will soon turn into a streak\r\nof bright crimson. They come out of the sheath quite easily, for the\r\nthick haunch makes way for the tapering knuckle.\r\n\r\nThe shank is a different matter. The shank of the full-grown insect\r\nbristles throughout its length with a double row of hard, pointed\r\nspikes. Moreover, the lower extremity ends in four large spurs. It is a\r\ngenuine saw, but with two parallel sets of teeth.\r\n\r\nNow this awkwardly shaped skin is enclosed in a sheath that is formed\r\nin exactly the same way. Each spur is fitted into a similar spur, each\r\ntooth into the hollow of a similar tooth. And the sheath is as close\r\nand as thin as a coat of varnish.\r\n\r\nNevertheless the saw-like skin slips out of its long narrow case\r\nwithout catching in it at any point whatever. If I had not seen this\r\nhappen over and over again I could never have believed it. The saw does\r\nno injury to the dainty scabbard which a puff of my breath is enough to\r\ntear; the formidable rake slips through without leaving the least\r\nscratch behind it.\r\n\r\nOne would expect that, because of the spiked armour, the envelope of\r\nthe leg would strip off in scales coming loose of themselves, or would\r\nbe rubbed off like dead skin. But the reality exceeds all possible\r\nexpectation. From the spurs and spikes of the infinitely thin envelope\r\nthere are drawn spurs and spikes so strong that they can cut soft wood.\r\nThis is done without violence, the discarded skin remains where it was,\r\nhanging by the claws to the top of the cage, uncreased and untorn. The\r\nmagnifying-glass shows not a trace of rough usage.\r\n\r\nIf it were suggested that one should draw out a saw from some sort of\r\ngold-beater’s skin sheath which had been exactly moulded on the steel,\r\nand that one should perform the operation without making the least\r\ntear, one would simply laugh. The thing would be impossible. Yet Nature\r\nmakes light of such impossibilities; she can realise the absurd, in\r\ncase of need.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty is overcome in this way. While the leg is being\r\nliberated it is not rigid, as it will presently be. It is soft and\r\nhighly flexible. Where it is exposed to view I see it bending and\r\ncurving: it is as supple as elastic cord. And farther on, where it is\r\nhidden, it is certainly still softer, it is almost fluid. The teeth of\r\nthe saw are there, but have none of their future sharpness. The spikes\r\nlie backwards when the leg is about to be drawn back: as it emerges\r\nthey stand up and become solid. A few minutes later the leg has\r\nattained the proper state of stiffness.\r\n\r\nAnd now the fine tunic is wrinkled and rumpled, and pushed back along\r\nthe body towards the tip. Except at this point the Locust is bare.\r\nAfter a rest of twenty minutes he makes a supreme effort; he raises\r\nhimself as he hangs, and grabs hold of his cast skin. Then he climbs\r\nhigher, and fixes himself to the wire of the cage with his four front\r\nfeet. He loosens the empty husk with one last shake, and it falls to\r\nthe ground. The Locust’s transformation is conducted in much the same\r\nway as the Cicada’s.\r\n\r\nThe insect is now standing erect, and therefore the flexible wings are\r\nin the right position. They are no longer curved backwards like the\r\npetals of a flower, they are no longer upside down; but they still look\r\nshabby and insignificant. All that we see is a few wrinkles, a few\r\nwinding furrows, which tell us that the stumps are bundles of cunningly\r\nfolded material, arranged so as to take up as little space as possible.\r\n\r\nVery gradually they expand, so gradually that their unfolding cannot be\r\nseen even under the microscope. The process continues for three hours.\r\nThen the wings and wing-cases stand up on the Locust’s back like a huge\r\nset of sails, sometimes colourless, sometimes pale-green, like the\r\nCicada’s wings at the beginning. One is amazed at their size when one\r\nthinks of the paltry bundles that represented them at first. How could\r\nso much stuff find room there?\r\n\r\nThe fairy tale tells us of a grain of hempseed that contained the\r\nunder-linen of a princess. Here is a grain that is even more\r\nastonishing. The one in the story took years and years to sprout and\r\nmultiply, till at last it yielded the hemp required for the trousseau:\r\nthe Locust’s tiny bundle supplies a sumptuous set of sails in three\r\nhours. They are formed of exquisitely fine gauze, a network of\r\ninnumerable tiny bars.\r\n\r\nIn the wing of the larva we can see only a few uncertain outlines of\r\nthe future lace-work. There is nothing to suggest the marvellous fabric\r\nwhose every mesh will have its form and place arranged for it, with\r\nabsolute exactness. Yet it is there, as the oak is inside the acorn.\r\n\r\nThere must be something to make the matter of the wing shape itself\r\ninto a sheet of gauze, into a labyrinth of meshes. There must be an\r\noriginal plan, an ideal pattern which gives each atom its proper place.\r\nThe stones of our buildings are arranged in accordance with the\r\narchitect’s plan; they form an imaginary building before they exist as\r\na real one. In the same way a Locust’s wing, that sumptuous piece of\r\nlace emerging from a miserable sheath, speaks to us of another\r\nArchitect, the Author of the plans which Nature must follow in her\r\nlabours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nTHE ANTHRAX FLY\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nA STRANGE MEAL\r\n\r\nI made the acquaintance of the Anthrax in 1855 at Carpentras, when I\r\nwas searching the slopes of which I have already told you, the slopes\r\nbeloved of the Anthophora-bees. Her curious pupa, so powerfully\r\nequipped to force an outlet for the perfect insect, which is incapable\r\nof the least effort, seemed worthy of investigation. For that pupa is\r\narmed with a ploughshare in front, a trident at its tail, and rows of\r\nharpoons on its back, with which to rip open the Osmia-bee’s cocoon and\r\nbreak through the hard crust of the hill-side.\r\n\r\nLet us, some day in July, knock away the pebbles that fasten the nests\r\nof the Mason-bees to the sloping ground on which they are built.\r\nLoosened by the shock, the dome comes off cleanly, all in one piece.\r\nMoreover—and this is a great advantage—the cells are all exposed at the\r\nbase of the nest, for at this point they have no other wall than the\r\nsurface of the pebble. Without any scraping, which would be wearisome\r\nwork for us and dangerous to the Bees, we have all the cells before our\r\neyes, together with their contents—a silky, amber-yellow cocoon, as\r\ndelicate and transparent as the skin of an onion. Let us split the\r\ndainty wrappers with the scissors, cell by cell, one after another. If\r\nfortune be at all kind, as it always is to the persevering, we shall\r\nend by finding cocoons harbouring two larvæ together, one more or less\r\nfaded in appearance, the other fresh and plump. We shall also find\r\nsome, no less plentiful, in which the withered larva is accompanied by\r\na family of little grubs wriggling uneasily round it.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to see that a tragedy is happening under the cover of the\r\ncocoon. The flabby, faded larva is the Mason-bee’s. A month ago, in\r\nJune, having finished its ration of honey, it wove itself a silken\r\nsheath in which to take the long sleep that precedes its\r\ntransformation. It was bulging with fat, and was a rich and a\r\ndefenceless morsel for any enemy that could reach it. And enemies did\r\nreach it. In spite of obstacles that might well seem insurmountable,\r\nthe wall of mortar and dome-shaped cover, the enemy grubs appeared in\r\nthe secret retreat, and began to eat the sleeper. Three different\r\nspecies take part in this murderous work, often in the same nest, in\r\nadjoining cells. We will concern ourselves only with the Anthrax Fly.\r\n\r\nThe grub, when it has eaten its victim and is left alone in the\r\nMason-bee’s cocoon, is a naked worm, smooth, legless, and blind. It is\r\ncreamy-white, and each of its segments or divisions forms a perfect\r\nring, very much curved when at rest, but almost straight when\r\ndisturbed. Including the head I can count thirteen segments,\r\nwell-marked in the middle of the body, but in the fore-part difficult\r\nto distinguish. The white, soft head shows no sign of any mouth, and is\r\nno bigger than a tiny pin’s head. The grub has four pale red stigmata,\r\nor openings through which to breathe, two in front and two behind, as\r\nis the rule among Flies. It has no walking-apparatus whatever; it is\r\nabsolutely incapable of shifting its position. If I disturb its rest,\r\nit curves and straightens itself alternately, tossing about violently\r\nwhere it lies; but it does not manage to progress.\r\n\r\nBut the most interesting point about the grub of the Anthrax is its\r\nmanner of eating. A most unexpected fact attracts our attention: the\r\ncurious ease with which this larva leaves and returns to the Bee-grub\r\non which it is feeding. After watching flesh-eating grubs at hundreds\r\nand hundreds of meals, I suddenly find myself confronted with a manner\r\nof eating that is entirely unlike anything I ever saw before.\r\n\r\nThis, for instance, is the Amophila-grub’s way of devouring its\r\ncaterpillar. A hole is made in the victim’s side, and the head and neck\r\nof the grub dives deep into the wound. It never withdraws its head,\r\nnever pauses to take breath. The voracious animal always goes forward,\r\nchewing, swallowing, digesting, until the caterpillar’s skin is empty.\r\nOnce the meal is begun, the creature does not budge as long as the food\r\nlasts. If moved by force it hesitates, and hunts about for the exact\r\nspot where it left off eating; for if the caterpillar be attacked at a\r\nfresh point it is liable to go bad.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the Anthrax-grub there is none of this mangling, none of\r\nthis persistent clinging to the original wound. If I tease it with the\r\ntip of a pointed brush it at once retires, and there is no wound to be\r\nseen on the victim, no sign of broken skin. Soon the grub once more\r\napplies its pimple-head to its meal, at any point, no matter where, and\r\nkeeps itself fixed there without any effort. If I repeat the touch with\r\nthe brush I see the same sudden retreat and the same calm return to the\r\nmeal.\r\n\r\nThe ease with which this larva grips, leaves, and regrips its victim,\r\nnow here, now there, and always without a wound, shows that the mouth\r\nof the Anthrax is not armed with fangs that can dig into the skin and\r\ntear it. If the flesh were gashed by pincers of any kind, one or two\r\nattempts would be necessary before they could leave go or take hold\r\nagain; and besides, the skin would be broken. There is nothing of the\r\nkind: the grub simply glues its mouth to its prey, and withdraws it. It\r\ndoes not chew its food like the other flesh-eating grub: it does not\r\neat, it inhales.\r\n\r\nThis remarkable fact led me to examine the mouth under the microscope.\r\nIt is a small conical crater, with yellowish-red sides and very faint\r\nlines running round it. At the bottom of this funnel is the opening of\r\nthe throat. There is not the slightest trace of mandibles or jaws, or\r\nany object capable of seizing and grinding food. There is nothing at\r\nall but the bowl-shaped opening. I know of no other example of a mouth\r\nlike this, which I can only compare to a cupping-glass. Its attack is a\r\nmere kiss, but what a cruel kiss!\r\n\r\nTo observe the working of this curious machine I placed a new-born\r\nAnthrax-grub, together with its prey, in a glass tube. Here I was able\r\nto watch the strange repast from beginning to end.\r\n\r\nThe Anthrax-grub—the Bee’s uninvited guest—is fixed by its mouth or\r\nsucker to any convenient part of the plump Bee-grub. It is ready to\r\nbreak off its kiss suddenly, should anything disturb it, and to resume\r\nit as easily when it wishes. After three or four days of this curious\r\ncontact the Bee-grub, formerly so fat, glossy, and healthy, begins to\r\nlook withered. Her sides fall in, her fresh colour fades, her skin\r\nbecomes covered with little folds, and she is evidently shrinking. A\r\nweek is hardly passed when these signs of exhaustion increase to a\r\nstartling degree. The victim is flabby and wrinkled, as though borne\r\ndown by her own weight. If I move her from her place she flops and\r\nsprawls like a half-filled indiarubber bottle. But the kiss of the\r\nAnthrax goes on emptying her: soon she is but a sort of shrivelled\r\nbladder, growing smaller and smaller from hour to hour. At length,\r\nbetween the twelfth and fifteenth day, all that remains of the\r\nMason-bee’s larva is a little white grain, hardly as large as a pin’s\r\nhead.\r\n\r\nIf I soften this small remnant in water, and then blow into it through\r\na very fine glass tube, the skin fills out and resumes the shape of the\r\nlarva. There is no outlet anywhere for the compressed air. It is\r\nintact: it is nowhere broken. This proves that, under the cupping-glass\r\nof the Anthrax, the skin has been drained through its pores.\r\n\r\nThe devouring grub, in making its attack, chooses its moment very\r\ncunningly. It is but an atom. Its mother, a feeble Fly, has done\r\nnothing to help it. She has no weapons; and she is quite incapable of\r\npenetrating the Mason-bee’s fortress. The future meal of the Anthrax\r\nhas not been paralysed, nor injured in any way. The parasite arrives—we\r\nshall presently see how; it arrives, scarcely visible, and having made\r\nits preparations it installs itself upon its monstrous victim, whom it\r\nis going to drain to the very husk. And the victim, though not\r\nparalysed nor in any way lacking in vitality, lets it have its way, and\r\nis sucked dry without a tremor or a quiver of resistance. No corpse\r\ncould show greater indifference to a bite.\r\n\r\nHad the Anthrax-grub appeared upon the scene earlier, when the Bee-grub\r\nwas eating her store of honey, things would surely have gone badly with\r\nit. The victim, feeling herself bled to death by that ravenous kiss,\r\nwould have protested with much wriggling of body and grinding of\r\nmandibles. The intruder would have perished. But at the hour chosen so\r\nwisely by it all danger is over. Enclosed in her silken sheath, the\r\nlarva is in the torpid state that precedes her transformation into a\r\nBee. Her condition is not death, but neither is it life. So there is no\r\nsign of irritation when I stir her with a needle, nor when the\r\nAnthrax-grub attacks her.\r\n\r\nThere is another marvellous point about the meal of the Anthrax-grub.\r\nThe Bee-grub remains alive until the very end. Were she really dead it\r\nwould, in less than twenty-four hours, turn a dirty-brown colour and\r\ndecompose. But during the whole fortnight that the meal lasts, the\r\nbutter-colour of the victim continues unaltered, and there is no sign\r\nof putrefaction. Life persists until the body is reduced to nothing.\r\nAnd yet, if I myself give her a wound, the whole body turns brown and\r\nsoon begins to rot. The prick of a needle makes her decompose. A mere\r\nnothing kills it; the atrocious draining of its strength does not.\r\n\r\nThe only explanation I can suggest is this, and it is no more than a\r\nsuggestion. Nothing but fluids can be drawn by the sucker of the\r\nAnthrax through the unpierced skin of the Bee-grub: no part of the\r\nbreathing-apparatus or the nervous system can pass. As these two\r\nessentials remain uninjured, life goes on until the fluid contents of\r\nthe skin are entirely exhausted. On the other hand, if I myself injure\r\nthe larva of the Bee, I disturb the nervous or the air-conducting\r\nsystem, and the bruised part spreads a taint all over the body.\r\n\r\nLiberty is a noble possession, even in an insignificant grub; but it\r\nhas its dangers everywhere. The Anthrax escapes these dangers only on\r\nthe condition of being, so to speak, muzzled. It finds its own way into\r\nthe Bee’s dwelling, quite independently of its mother. Unlike most of\r\nthe other flesh-eating larvæ it is not fixed by its mother’s care at\r\nthe most suitable spot for its meal. It is perfectly free to attack its\r\nprey where it chooses. If it had a set of carving-tools, of jaws and\r\nmandibles, it would meet with a speedy death. It would split open its\r\nvictim and bite it at random, and its food would rot. Its freedom of\r\naction would kill it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nTHE WAY OUT\r\n\r\nThere are other grub-eaters which drain their victims without wounding\r\nthem, but not one, among those I know, reaches such perfection in this\r\nart as the Anthrax-grub. Nor can any be compared with the Anthrax as\r\nregards the means brought into play in order to leave the cell. The\r\nothers, when they become perfect insects, have implements for mining\r\nand demolishing. They have stout mandibles, capable of digging the\r\nground, of pulling down clay partition-walls, and even of grinding the\r\nMason-bee’s tough cement to powder. The Anthrax, in her final form, has\r\nnothing like this. Her mouth is a short, soft proboscis, good at most\r\nfor soberly licking the sugary fluid from the flowers. Her slim legs\r\nare so feeble that to move a grain of sand would be too heavy a task\r\nfor them, enough to strain every joint. Her great stiff wings, which\r\nmust remain full-spread, do not allow her to slip through a narrow\r\npassage. Her delicate suit of downy velvet, from which you take the\r\nbloom by merely breathing on it, could not withstand the contact of\r\nrough tunnels. She is unable to enter the Mason-bee’s cells to lay her\r\negg, and equally unable to leave it when the time comes to free herself\r\nand appear in broad daylight.\r\n\r\nAnd the grub, for its part, is powerless to prepare the way for the\r\ncoming flight. That buttery little cylinder, owning no tools but a\r\nsucker so flimsy and small that it is barely visible through the\r\nmagnifying-glass, is even weaker than the full-grown insect, which at\r\nleast flies and walks. The Mason-bee’s cell seems to this creature like\r\na granite cave. How can it get out? The problems would be insoluble to\r\nthese two incapables, if nothing else played its part.\r\n\r\nAmong insects the pupa—the transition stage, when the creature is no\r\nlonger a grub but is not yet a perfect insect—is generally a striking\r\npicture of complete weakness. A sort of mummy, tightly bound in\r\nswaddling-clothes, motionless and unconscious, it awaits its\r\ntransformation. Its tender flesh is hardly solid; its limbs are\r\ntransparent as crystals, and are held fixed in their place, lest a\r\nmovement should disturb the work of development. In the same way, to\r\nsecure his recovery, a patient whose bones are broken is held bound in\r\nthe surgeon’s bandages.\r\n\r\nWell, here, by a strange reversal of the usual state of things, a\r\nstupendous task is laid upon the pupa of the Anthrax. It is the pupa\r\nthat has to toil, to strive, to exhaust itself in efforts to burst the\r\nwall and open the way out. To the pupa falls the desperate duty, to the\r\nfull-grown insect the joy of resting in the sun. The result of these\r\nunusual conditions is that the pupa possesses a strange and complicated\r\nset of tools that is in no way suggested by the grub nor recalled by\r\nthe perfect Fly. This set of tools includes a collection of\r\nploughshares, gimlets, hooks, spears, and other implements that are not\r\nfound in our trades nor named in our dictionaries. I will do my best to\r\ndescribe the strange gear.\r\n\r\nBy the time that July is nearly over the Anthrax has finished eating\r\nthe Bee-grub. From that time until the following May it lies motionless\r\nin the Mason-bee’s cocoon, beside the remains of its victim. When the\r\nfine days of May arrive it shrivels, and casts its skin; and it is then\r\nthat the pupa appears, fully clad in a stout, reddish, horny hide.\r\n\r\nThe head is round and large, and is crowned on top and in front with a\r\nsort of diadem of six hard, sharp, black spikes, arranged in\r\nsemi-circle. This sixfold ploughshare is the chief digging-implement.\r\nLower down the instrument is finished off with a separate group of two\r\nsmall black spikes, placed close together.\r\n\r\nFour segments in the middle of the body are armed on the back with a\r\nbelt of little horny arches, set in the skin upside down. They are\r\narranged parallel to one another, and are finished at both ends with a\r\nhard, black point. The belt forms a double row of little thorns, with a\r\nhollow in between. There are about two hundred spikes on the four\r\nsegments. The use of this rasp, or grater, is obvious: it helps the\r\npupa to steady itself on the wall of the gallery as the work proceeds.\r\nThus anchored on a host of points the brave pioneer is able to hit the\r\nobstacle harder with its crown of awls. Moreover, to make it more\r\ndifficult for the instrument to recoil, there are long, stiff bristles,\r\npointing backwards, scattered here and there among the rows of spikes.\r\nThere are some also on other segments, and on the sides they are\r\narranged in clusters. Two more belts of thorns, less powerful than the\r\nothers, and a sheaf of eight spikes at the tip of the body—two of which\r\nare longer than the rest—completes the strange boring-machine that\r\nprepares an outlet for the feeble Anthrax.\r\n\r\nAbout the end of May the colouring of the pupa alters, and shows that\r\nthe transformation is close at hand. The head and fore-part of the\r\ncreature become a handsome, shiny black, prophetic of the black livery\r\nworn by the coming insect. I was anxious to see the boring-tools in\r\naction, and, since this could not be done in natural conditions, I\r\nconfined the Anthrax in a glass tube, between two thick stoppers of\r\nsorghum-pith. The space between the stoppers was about the same size as\r\nthe Bee’s cell, and the partitions, though not so strong as the Bee’s\r\nmasonry, were firm enough to withstand considerable effort. On the\r\nother hand the side-walls, being of glass, could not be gripped by the\r\ntoothed belts, which made matters much harder for the worker.\r\n\r\nNo matter: in the space of a single day the pupa pierced the front\r\npartition, three-quarters of an inch thick. I saw it fixing its double\r\nploughshare against the back partition, arching itself into a bow, and\r\nthen suddenly releasing itself and striking the stopper in front of it\r\nwith its barbed forehead. Under the blows of the spikes the pith slowly\r\ncrumbled to pieces, atom by atom. At long intervals the method of work\r\nchanged. The animal drove its crown of awls into the pith, and fidgeted\r\nand swayed about for a time; then the blows began again. Now and then\r\nthere were intervals of rest. At last the hole was made. The pupa\r\nslipped into it, but did not pass through entirely. The head and chest\r\nappeared beyond the hole, but the rest of the body remained held in the\r\ntunnel.\r\n\r\nThe glass cell certainly puzzled my Anthrax. The hole through the pith\r\nwas wide and irregular: it was a clumsy breach and not a gallery. When\r\nmade through the Mason-bee’s walls it is fairly neat, and exactly of\r\nthe animal’s diameter. For narrowness and evenness in the exit-tunnel\r\nare necessary. The pupa always remains half-caught in it, and even\r\npretty securely fixed by the graters on its back. Only the head and\r\nchest emerge into the outer air. A fixed support is indispensable, for\r\nwithout it the Anthrax could not issue from her horny sheath, unfurling\r\nher great wings and drawing out her slender legs.\r\n\r\nShe therefore remains steadily fixed by the graters on her back, in the\r\nnarrow exit-gallery. All is now ready. The transformation begins. Two\r\nslits appear on the head: one along the forehead, and a second,\r\ncrossing it, dividing the skull in two and extending down the chest.\r\nThrough this cross-shaped opening the Anthrax Fly suddenly appears. She\r\nsteadies herself upon her trembling legs, dries her wings and takes to\r\nflight, leaving her cast skin at the doorway of the gallery. The\r\nsad-coloured Fly has five or six weeks before her wherein to explore\r\nthe clay nests amid the thyme and to take her small share of the joys\r\nof life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nTHE WAY IN\r\n\r\nIf you have paid attention to this story of the Anthrax Fly, you must\r\nhave noticed that it is incomplete. The Fox in the fable saw how the\r\nLion’s visitors entered his den, but did not see how they went out.\r\nWith us the case is reversed: we know the way out of the Mason-bee’s\r\nfortress, but we do not know the way in. To leave the cell whose owner\r\nit has eaten, the Anthrax becomes a boring-tool. When the exit-tunnel\r\nis opened this tool splits like a pod bursting in the sun, and from the\r\nstrong framework there escapes a dainty Fly. A soft bit of fluff that\r\ncontrasts strangely with the roughness of the prison whence it comes.\r\nOn this point we know pretty well what there is to know. But the\r\nentrance of the grub into the cell puzzled me for a quarter of a\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nIt is plain that the mother cannot place her egg in the Bee’s cell,\r\nwhich is closed and barricaded with a cement wall. To pierce it she\r\nwould have to become a boring-tool once more, and get into the cast-off\r\nrags which she left at the doorway of the exit-tunnel. She would have\r\nto become a pupa again. For the full-grown Fly has no claws, nor\r\nmandibles, nor any implement capable of working its way through the\r\nwall.\r\n\r\nCan it be, then, the grub that makes its own way into the storeroom,\r\nthat same grub that we have seen sucking the life out of the Bee’s\r\nlarva? Let us call the creature to mind: a little oily sausage, which\r\nstretches and curls up just where it lies, without being able to shift\r\nits position. Its body is a smooth cylinder, its mouth a circular lip.\r\nIt has no means whatever of moving; not even a hair or a wrinkle to\r\nenable it to crawl. It can do nothing but digest its food. It is even\r\nless able than the mother to make its way into the Mason-bee’s\r\ndwelling. And yet its provisions are there: they must be reached: it is\r\na matter of life and death. How does the Fly set about it? In the face\r\nof this puzzle I resolved to attempt an almost impossible task and\r\nwatch the Anthrax from the moment it left the egg.\r\n\r\nSince these Flies are not really plentiful in my own neighbourhood I\r\nmade an expedition to Carpentras, the dear little town where I spent my\r\ntwentieth year. The old college where I made my first attempts as a\r\nteacher was unchanged in appearance. It still looked like a\r\npenitentiary. In my early days it was considered unwholesome for boys\r\nto be gay and active, so our system of education applied the remedy of\r\nmelancholy and gloom. Our houses of instruction were above all houses\r\nof correction. In a yard between four walls, a sort of bear-pit, the\r\nboys fought to make room for their games under a spreading plane-tree.\r\nAll round it were cells like horseboxes, without light or air: those\r\nwere the class-rooms.\r\n\r\nI saw, too, the shop where I used to buy tobacco as I came out of the\r\ncollege; and also my former dwelling, now occupied by monks. There, in\r\nthe embrasure of a window, sheltered from profane hands, between the\r\nclosed outer shutters and the panes, I kept my chemicals—bought for a\r\nfew sous saved out of the housekeeping money. My experiments, harmless\r\nor dangerous, were made on a corner of the fire, beside the simmering\r\nbroth. How I should love to see that room again, where I pored over\r\nmathematical problems; and my familiar friend the blackboard, which I\r\nhired for five francs a year, and could never buy outright for want of\r\nthe necessary cash!\r\n\r\nBut I must return to my insects. My visit to Carpentras, unfortunately,\r\nwas made too late in the year to be very profitable. I saw only a few\r\nAnthrax Flies hovering round the face of the cliff. Yet I did not\r\ndespair, because it was plain that these few were not there to take\r\nexercise, but to settle their families.\r\n\r\nSo I took my stand at the foot of the rock, under a broiling sun, and\r\nfor half a day I followed the movements of my Flies. They flitted\r\nquietly in front of the slope, a few inches away from the earthly\r\ncovering. They went from one Bee’s nest to another, but without\r\nattempting to enter. For that matter, the attempt would be useless, for\r\nthe galleries are too narrow to admit their spreading wings. So they\r\nsimply explore the cliff, going to and fro, and up and down, with a\r\nflight that was now sudden, now smooth and slow. From time to time I\r\nsaw one of them approach the wall and touch the earth suddenly with the\r\ntip of her body. The proceeding took no longer than the twinkling of an\r\neye. When it was over the insect rested a moment, and then resumed\r\nflight.\r\n\r\nI was certain that, at the moment when the Fly tapped the earth, she\r\nlaid her eggs on the spot. Yet, though I rushed forward and examined\r\nthe place with my lens, I could see no egg. In spite of the closest\r\nattention I could distinguish nothing. The truth is that my state of\r\nexhaustion, together with the blinding light and scorching heat, made\r\nit difficult for me to see anything. Afterwards, when I made the\r\nacquaintance of the tiny thing that comes out of that egg, my failure\r\nno longer surprised me: for even in the leisure and peace of my study I\r\nhave the greatest difficulty in finding the infinitesimal creature. How\r\nthen could I see the egg, worn out as I was under the sun-baked cliff?\r\n\r\nNone the less I was convinced that I had seen the Anthrax Flies\r\nstrewing their eggs, one by one, on the spots frequented by the Bees\r\nwho suit their grubs. They take no precaution to place the egg under\r\ncover, and indeed the structure of the mother makes any such precaution\r\nimpossible. The egg, that delicate object, is laid roughly in the\r\nblazing sun, among grains of sand, in some wrinkle of the chalk. It is\r\nthe business of the young grub to manage as best it can.\r\n\r\nThe next year I continued my investigations, this time on the Anthrax\r\nof the Chalicodoma, a Bee that abounds in my own neighbourhood. Every\r\nmorning I took the field at nine o’clock, when the sun begins to be\r\nunendurable. I was prepared to come back with my head aching from the\r\nglare, if only I could bring home the solution of my puzzle. The\r\ngreater the heat, the better my chances of success. What gives me\r\ntorture fills the insect with delight; what prostrates me braces the\r\nFly.\r\n\r\nThe road shimmers like a sheet of molten steel. From the dusty,\r\nmelancholy olive-trees rises a mighty, throbbing hum, the concert of\r\nthe Cicadæ, who sway and rustle with increasing frenzy as the\r\ntemperature increases. The Cicada of the Ash adds its strident\r\nscrapings to the single note of the Common Cicada. This is the moment!\r\nFor five or six weeks, oftenest in the morning, sometimes in the\r\nafternoon, I set myself to explore the rocky waste.\r\n\r\nThere were plenty of the nests I wanted, but I could not see a single\r\nAnthrax on their surface. Not one settled in front of me to lay her\r\negg. At most, from time to time, I could see one passing far away, with\r\nan impetuous rush. I would lose her in the distance; and that was all.\r\nIt was impossible to be present at the laying of the egg. In vain I\r\nenlisted the services of the small boys who keep the sheep in our\r\nmeadows, and talked to them of a big black Fly and the nests on which\r\nshe ought to settle. By the end of August my last illusions were\r\ndispelled. Not one of us had succeeded in seeing the big black Fly\r\nperching on the dome of the Mason-bee.\r\n\r\nThe reason is, I believe, that she never perches there. She comes and\r\ngoes in every direction across the stony plain. Her practised eye can\r\ndetect, as she flies, the earthen dome which she is seeking, and having\r\nfound it she swoops down, leaves her egg on it, and makes off without\r\nsetting foot on the ground. Should she take a rest it will be\r\nelsewhere, on the soil, on a stone, on a tuft of lavender or thyme. It\r\nis no wonder that neither I nor my young shepherds could find her egg.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile I searched the Mason-bees’ nests for grubs just out of the\r\negg. My shepherds procured me heaps of the nests, enough to fill\r\nbaskets and baskets; and these I inspected at leisure on my work-table.\r\nI took the cocoons from the cells, and examined them within and\r\nwithout: my lens explored their innermost recesses, the sleeping larva,\r\nand the walls. Nothing, nothing, nothing! For a fortnight and more\r\nnests were searched and rejected, and heaped up in a corner. My study\r\nwas crammed with them. In vain I ripped up the cocoons; I found\r\nnothing. It needed the sturdiest faith to make me persevere.\r\n\r\nAt last I saw, or seemed to see, something move on the Bee’s larva. Was\r\nit an illusion? Was it a bit of down stirred by my breath? It was not\r\nan illusion; it was not a bit of down; it was really and truly a grub!\r\nBut at first I thought the discovery unimportant, because I was so\r\ngreatly puzzled by the little creature’s appearance.\r\n\r\nIn a couple of days I was the owner of ten such worms and had placed\r\neach of them in a glass tube, together with the Bee-grub on which it\r\nwriggled. It was so tiny that the least fold of skin concealed it from\r\nmy sight. After watching it one day through the lens I sometimes failed\r\nto find it again on the morrow. I would think it was lost: then it\r\nwould move, and become visible once more.\r\n\r\nFor some time the belief had been growing in me that the Anthrax had\r\ntwo larval forms, a first and a second, the second being the form I\r\nknew, the grub we have already seen at its meals. Was this new\r\ndiscovery, I asked myself, the first form? Time showed me that it was.\r\nFor at last I saw my little worms transform themselves into the grub I\r\nhave already described, and make their first start at draining their\r\nvictims with kisses. A few moments of satisfaction like those I then\r\nenjoyed make up for many a weary hour.\r\n\r\nThis tiny worm, the first form or “primary larva” of the Anthrax, is\r\nvery active. It tramps over the fat sides of its victim, walking all\r\nround it. It covers the ground pretty quickly, buckling and unbuckling\r\nby turns, very much after the manner of the Looper-caterpillar. Its two\r\nends are its chief points of support. When walking it swells out, and\r\nthen looks like a bit of knotted string. It has thirteen rings or\r\nsegments, including its tiny head, which bristles in front with short,\r\nstiff hairs. There are four other pairs of bristles on the lower\r\nsurface, and with the help of these it walks.\r\n\r\nFor a fortnight the feeble grub remains in this condition, without\r\ngrowing, and apparently without eating. Indeed, what could it eat? In\r\nthe cocoon there is nothing but the larva of the Mason-bee, and the\r\nworm cannot eat this before it has the sucker or mouth that comes with\r\nthe second form. Nevertheless, as I said before, though it does not eat\r\nit is far from idle. It explores its future dish, and runs all over the\r\nneighborhood.\r\n\r\nNow, there is a very good reason for this long fast. In the natural\r\nstate of the Anthrax-grub it is necessary. The egg is laid by the\r\nmother on the surface of the nest, at a distance from the Bee’s larva,\r\nwhich is protected by a thick rampart. It is the business of the\r\nnew-born grub to make its way to its provisions, not by violence, of\r\nwhich it is incapable, but by patiently slipping through a maze of\r\ncracks. It is a very difficult task, even for this slender worm, for\r\nthe Bee’s masonry is exceedingly compact. There are no chinks due to\r\nbad building, no cracks due to the weather. I see but one weak point,\r\nand that only in a few nests: it is the line where the dome joins the\r\nsurface of the stone. This weakness so seldom occurs that I believe the\r\nAnthrax-grub is able to find an entrance at any spot on the dome of the\r\nBee’s nest.\r\n\r\nThe grub is extremely weak, and has nothing but invincible patience.\r\nHow long it takes to work its way through the masonry I cannot say. The\r\nwork is so laborious and the worker so feeble! In some cases I believe\r\nit may be months before the slow journey is accomplished. So it is very\r\nfortunate, you see, that this first form of the Anthrax, which exists\r\nonly in order to pierce the walls of the Bees’ nest, should be able to\r\nlive without food.\r\n\r\nAt last I saw my young worms shrink, and rid themselves of their outer\r\nskin. They then appeared as the grub I knew and was so anxiously\r\nexpecting, the grub of the Anthrax, the cream-colored cylinder with the\r\nlittle button of a head. Fastening its round sucker to the Bee-grub, it\r\nbegan its meal. You know the rest.\r\n\r\nBefore taking leave of this tiny animal let us dwell for a moment on\r\nits marvellous instinct. Picture it as having just left the egg, just\r\nawakened to life under the fierce rays of the sun. The bare stone is\r\nits cradle; there is no one to welcome it as it enters the world, a\r\nmere thread of half-solid substance. Instantly it starts on its\r\nstruggle with the flint. Obstinately it sounds each pore of the stone;\r\nit slips in, crawls on, retreats, begins again. What inspiration urges\r\nit towards its food, what compass guides it? What does it know of those\r\ndepths, or of what lies in them? Nothing. What does the root of a plant\r\nknow of the earth’s fruitfulness? Again, nothing. Yet both the root and\r\nthe worm make for the nourishing spot, Why? I do not understand. I do\r\nnot even try to understand. The question is far above us.\r\n\r\nWe have now followed the complete history of the Anthrax. Its life is\r\ndivided into four periods, each of which has its special form and its\r\nspecial work. The primary larva enters the Bees’ nest, which contains\r\nprovisions; the secondary larva eats those provisions; the pupa brings\r\nthe insect to light by boring through the enclosing wall; the perfect\r\ninsect strews its eggs. Then the story starts afresh.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] See Insect Adventures, retold for young people from the works of\r\nHenri Fabre.\r\n\r\n[2] English translation by Mr Stephen M’Kenna.",
