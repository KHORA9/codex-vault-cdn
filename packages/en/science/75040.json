These were\r\nthe Pyramids of Egypt, the Colossus of Rhodes, the Aqueducts of Rome,\r\nthe Labyrinth on the banks of the Nile, the Pharos of Alexandria, the\r\nWalls of Babylon, and the temple of Diana at Ephesus. But the WONDERS\r\nknown to those of the _present_ day, may be counted by hundreds: wonders\r\nof Nature, wonders of Science, wonders of Art, and Miscellaneous\r\nwonders; each department full, to overflowing, of themes of the richest\r\ninstruction and deepest interest.\r\n\r\nTo present some of the most striking of these wonders, in a manner that\r\nshall be acceptable to the man of science and profound research, and at\r\nthe same time full of interest to the general reader, and the family at\r\nthe fireside, has been the aim of the editor of the following pages. The\r\nexaggerated and marvelous stories which the mischievous fancy of\r\ntravelers has too often imposed on the credulity of the weak, as well as\r\nthe foolish fables founded in bigotry and superstition, which were too\r\noften received as truths in the dark ages, have been carefully avoided,\r\nand, where the narrative permitted, exposed; and nothing has been\r\nbrought forward that has not been confirmed by the concurrent testimony\r\nof enlightened travelers, and men of science, and extended observation.\r\nOn the subjects in which Nature, in her various departments, displays\r\nher most wondrous magnificence and beauty; or in those in which Science\r\nand Art have sought out their most wondrous inventions, and wrought out\r\nthe most wondrous results, the best authorities have been carefully\r\nconsulted. And the endeavor has been, so to assemble and arrange the\r\nmultiplied objects of wonder and delight, as to confer a lasting benefit\r\non the rising generation, and on families, and at the same time to\r\npresent a work that shall commend itself to those whose lives have been\r\nwholly devoted to researches among the sublime wonders of nature,\r\nscience and art. Believing that the standard of general reading is\r\nconstantly rising higher, and that the sphere of intellectual tastes and\r\npursuits is constantly growing wider, the writer has endeavored to\r\nprepare a volume that shall have more than the interest of fiction, and,\r\nat the same time, the ripe and rich instruction of the book of travels,\r\nor the work of science or descriptive art. The table of contents makes\r\nmanifest how extensive the range of the topics presented; while the list\r\nof engravings may show how profusely and richly the enterprise of the\r\npublishers has illustrated a work, which it is hoped may meet with\r\nuniversal acceptance.\r\n\r\n                                                            J.

------------------------------------\r\n\r\n                               MOUNTAINS.\r\n\r\n         “And lo! the mountains print the distant sky,\r\n           And o’er their airy tops faint clouds are driven,\r\n         So softly blending that the cheated eye,\r\n           Forgets or which is earth, or which is heaven!”—FAY.\r\n\r\n\r\n“Mountains and all hills—let them praise the name of the Lord, for his\r\nname alone is excellent; his glory is above the earth and\r\nheaven.”—DAVID.\r\n\r\nAmong the _wonders_, or uncommon phenomena of the world, may be classed\r\nstupendous _mountains_. For though compared with the entire diameter of\r\nthe earth, the highest elevations on its surface are no more than the\r\ninequalities on the skin of the orange to the orange itself, yet to our\r\neyes they often appear immensely lofty and sublime. Descriptions of such\r\nvast and striking objects often fail to excite corresponding ideas; so\r\nthat however accurate or poetical may be the accounts of this class of\r\nthe prodigies of nature, no just notions of their vastness can be\r\nconveyed, by any written or graphical representation. The magnitude of\r\nan object must be seen to be duly conceived; and the mountain-wonders of\r\nthe world will best be understood and felt by those who have visited\r\nWales, Scotland, Switzerland, or the mountainous regions of America or\r\nAsia.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               THE ANDES.\r\n\r\nSome of the loftiest and most extensive mountains in the world, are the\r\nAndes, in South America. These stupendous hills, called by the Spaniards\r\nthe =Cordilleras=, (from the word _cord_ or _chain_,) =i. e.=, the\r\nchains of the Andes, stretch north and south near the western coast,\r\nfrom the isthmus of Darien, through the whole of the continent of South\r\nAmerica, to the straits of Magellan. In the north, there are three\r\nchains of separate ridges; but in advancing from Popayan toward the\r\nsouth, the three chains unite into a single group, which is continued\r\nfar beyond the equator. In Equador, near Quito, the more elevated\r\nsummits of this group are ranged in two rows, (as seen in the cut\r\nbelow,) which form a double crest to the Cordilleras. The extent of the\r\nAndes mountains is not less than four thousand three hundred miles, from\r\none end to the other.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CORDILLERAS, OR ANDES, NEAR QUITO.]\r\n\r\n       “Rocks rich in gems, and mountains big with mines,\r\n       That on the high equator ridgy rise,\r\n       Whence many a bursting stream auriferous plays.”—THOMSON.\r\n\r\nIn this country, the operations of nature appear to have been carried on\r\non a larger scale, and with a bolder hand, than elsewhere; and in\r\nconsequence, the whole is distinguished by a peculiar magnificence. Even\r\nthe plain of Quito, which may be considered as the base of the Andes, is\r\nmore elevated above the sea than the summits of many European mountains.\r\nIn different places the Andes rise more than one-third higher than the\r\nfamous peak of Teneriffe, the highest land in the ancient hemisphere.\r\nTheir cloud-enveloped summits, though exposed to the rays of the sun in\r\nthe torrid zone, are covered with eternal snows, and below them the\r\nstorm is seen to burst, and the exploring traveler hears the thunder\r\nroll, and sees the lightnings dart beneath his feet. Throughout the\r\nwhole of the range of these extensive mountains, as far as they have\r\nbeen explored, there is a certain boundary, above which the snow never\r\nmelts; which boundary, in the torrid zone, has been ascertained to be\r\nfourteen thousand, six hundred feet, or nearly three miles above the\r\nlevel of the sea.\r\n\r\nThe ascent to the plain of Quito, on which stands Chimborazo, Cotopaxi,\r\nPichincha, &c., is thus described by Don Juan de Ulloa:\r\n\r\n“The ruggedness of the road from Taraguaga, leading up the mountain, is\r\nnot easily described. The declivity is so great, in some parts, that the\r\nmules can scarcely keep their footing; and, in others, the acclivity is\r\nequally difficult. The trouble of sending people before to mend the\r\nroad, the pain arising from the many falls and bruises, and the being\r\nconstantly wet to the skin, might be supported; but these inconveniences\r\nare augmented by the sight of such frightful precipices and deep\r\nabysses, as excite in the mind constant terror. The road, in some\r\nplaces, is so steep, and yet so narrow, that the mules are obliged to\r\nslide down without making any use whatever of their feet. On one side of\r\nthe rider, in this situation, rises an eminence of many hundred yards;\r\nand, on the other, is an abyss of equal depth; so that, if he should\r\ngive the least check to his mule, and destroy the equilibrium, both must\r\ninevitably perish.\r\n\r\n“Having traveled nine days in this manner, slowly winding along the\r\nsides of the mountains, we began to find the whole country covered with\r\na hoar-frost; and a hut, in which we reposed, had ice in it. At length,\r\nafter a perilous journey of fifteen days, we arrived upon a plain, at\r\nthe extremity of which stands the city of Quito, the capital of one of\r\nthe most charming regions in the world. Here, in the center of the\r\ntorrid zone, the heat is not only very tolerable, but, in some places,\r\nthe cold is even painful. Here the inhabitants enjoy the temperature and\r\nadvantages of perpetual spring; the fields being constantly covered with\r\nverdure, and enameled with flowers of the most lively colors. But\r\nalthough this beautiful region is more elevated than any other country\r\nin the world, and it employs so many days of painful journey in the\r\nascent, it is itself overlooked by tremendous mountains, their sides\r\nbeing covered with snow, while their summits are flaming with volcanoes.\r\nThese mountains seem piled one upon the other, and to rise, with great\r\nboldness, to an astonishing hight. However, at a determined point above\r\nthe surface of the sea, the congelation is found at the same hight in\r\nall the mountains. Those parts which are not subject to a continual\r\nfrost, have here and there growing upon them a species of rush,\r\nresembling the broom, but much softer and more flexible. Toward the\r\nextremity of the part where the rush grows, and the cold begins to\r\nincrease, is found a vegetable with a round bulbous head. Higher still,\r\nthe earth is bare of vegetation, and seems covered with eternal snow.\r\nThe most remarkable of the Andes are the mountains of Chimborazo,\r\nCotopaxi, and Pichincha.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHIMBORAZO.\r\n\r\nThis is the most lofty and majestic peak of the Andes, and has a\r\ncircular summit. It is twenty-two thousand feet, or more than four miles\r\nhigh. On the shores of the ocean, after the long rains of winter,\r\nChimborazo appears like a cloud in the horizon. It detaches itself from\r\nthe neighboring summits, and raises its lofty head over the whole chain\r\nof the Andes. Travelers who have approached the summits of Mont Blanc\r\nand Mont Rose, are alone capable of feeling the effect of such vast,\r\nmajestic, and solemn scenery.\r\n\r\nThe bulk of Chimborazo is so enormous, that the part which the eye\r\nembraces at once, near the limit of the snows, is twenty-two thousand,\r\nnine hundred and sixty-eight feet, or four miles and a third in breadth.\r\nThe extreme rarity of the strata of air across which the summits of the\r\nAndes are seen, contributes greatly to the splendor of the snow and the\r\nmagical effect of its reflection. Under the tropics, at a hight of\r\nsixteen thousand, four hundred feet, or upward of three miles, the azure\r\nvault of the heavens appears of an indigo tint; while, in so pure and\r\ntransparent an atmosphere, the outlines of the mountains seem to detach\r\nthemselves from the sky, and produce an effect at once sublime, awful,\r\nand profoundly impressive.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of the loftiest of the Himalaya, in Asia, Chimborazo\r\nis the highest known mountain in the world. Humboldt, Bonpland, and\r\nMontufar, were persevering enough to approach within one thousand, six\r\nhundred feet of the summit of this mighty king of mountains. Being aided\r\nin their ascent by a train of volcanic rocks, destitute of snow, they\r\nthus attained the amazing hight of nearly four miles above the level of\r\nthe sea; and the former of these naturalists is persuaded that they\r\nmight have reached the highest summit, had it not been for the\r\nintervention of a great crevice, or gap, which they were unable to\r\ncross. They were, therefore, obliged to descend, after experiencing\r\ngreat inconveniences and many unpleasant sensations. For three or four\r\ndays, even after their return into the plain, they were not free from\r\nsickness, and an uncomfortable feeling, owing, as they suppose, to the\r\nvast proportion of oxygen in the atmosphere above. Long before they\r\nreached the above surprising hight, they had been abandoned by their\r\nguides, the Indians, who had taken alarm and were fearful of their\r\nlives. So great was the fall of snow on their return, that they could\r\nscarcely recognize each other, and they all suffered dreadfully from the\r\nintenseness of the cold.\r\n\r\nA great number of Spaniards formerly perished in crossing the vast and\r\ndangerous deserts which lie on the declivity of Chimborazo; being now,\r\nhowever, better acquainted with them, such misfortunes seldom occur,\r\nespecially as very few take this route, unless there be a prospect of\r\ncalm and serene weather.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               COTOPAXI.\r\n\r\nThis mountain is the loftiest of those volcanoes of the Andes which, at\r\nrecent epochs, have undergone eruptions. Notwithstanding it lies near\r\nthe equator, its summits are covered with perpetual snows. The absolute\r\nhight of Cotopaxi is eighteen thousand, eight hundred and seventy-six\r\nfeet, or three miles and a half; consequently it is two thousand, six\r\nhundred and twenty-two feet, or half a mile, higher than Vesuvius would\r\nbe, were that mountain placed on the top of the peak of Teneriffe!\r\nCotopaxi is the most mischievous of the volcanoes in the vicinity of\r\nQuito, and its explosions are the most frequent and disastrous. The\r\nmasses of scoriæ, and the pieces of rock, thrown out of this volcano,\r\ncover a surface of several square leagues, and would form, were they\r\nheaped together, a prodigious mountain. In 1738, the flames of Cotopaxi\r\nrose three thousand feet, or upward of half a mile, above the brink of\r\nthe crater. In 1744, the roarings of this volcano were heard at the\r\ndistance of six hundred miles. On the fourth of April, 1768, the\r\nquantity of ashes ejected at the mouth of Cotopaxi was so great, that it\r\nwas dark till three in the afternoon. The explosion which took place in\r\n1803, was preceded by the sudden melting of the snows which covered the\r\nmountain. For twenty years before no smoke or vapor, that could be\r\nperceived, had issued from the crater; but in a single night the\r\nsubterraneous fires became so active, that at sunrise the external walls\r\nof the cone, heated to a very considerable temperature, appeared naked,\r\nand of the dark color which is peculiar to vitrified scoriæ. “At the\r\nport of Guyaquil,” observes Humboldt, “fifty-two leagues distant in a\r\nstraight line from the crater, we heard, day and night, the noise of\r\nthis volcano, like continued discharges of a battery; and we\r\ndistinguished these tremendous sounds even on the Pacific ocean.”\r\n\r\nThe form of Cotopaxi is the most beautiful and regular of the colossal\r\nsummits of the high Andes. It is a perfect cone, which, covered with a\r\nperpetual layer of snow, shines with dazzling splendor at the setting of\r\nthe sun, and detaches itself in the most picturesque manner from the\r\nazure vault above. This covering of snow conceals from the eye of the\r\nobserver even the smallest inequalities of the soil; no point of rock,\r\nno stony mass, penetrating this coat of ice, or breaking the regularity\r\nof the figure of the cone.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               PICHINCHA.\r\n\r\nThough celebrated for its great hight, Pichincha is three thousand,\r\neight hundred and forty-nine feet, or three-fourths of a mile, lower\r\nthan the perpendicular elevation of Cotopaxi. It was formerly a volcano;\r\nbut the mouth or crater on one of its sides is now covered with sand or\r\ncalcined matter, so that at present neither smoke nor ashes issue from\r\nit.\r\n\r\nWhen it was ascended by Don George Juan and Don Antonio de Ulloa, for\r\nthe purpose of their astronomical observations, they found the cold on\r\nthe top of this mountain extremely intense, the wind very violent, and\r\nthe fog, or, in other words, the cloud, so thick, that objects at the\r\ndistance of six or eight paces were scarcely discernible. On the air\r\nbecoming clear, by the clouds descending nearer the earth, in such a\r\nmanner as to surround the mountain on all sides to a vast distance,\r\nthese clouds afforded a lively representation of the sea, in which the\r\ntop of the mountain seemed to stand, like an island in the center.\r\n\r\n         “With aspect mild, and elevated eye,\r\n         Behold him seated on a mount serene,\r\n         Above the fogs of sense, and passion’s storm:\r\n         All the black cares and tumults of this life,\r\n         Like harmless thunders, breaking at his feet.”—YOUNG.\r\n\r\nWhen the clouds descended, the astronomers heard the dreadful noise of\r\ntempests, which discharged themselves from them on the adjacent country.\r\nThey saw the lightning issue from the clouds, and heard the thunder roll\r\nfar beneath them. While the lower parts were thus involved in tempests\r\nof thunder and rain, they enjoyed a delightful serenity; the wind\r\nabated, the sky cleared, and the enlivening rays of the sun moderated\r\nthe severity of the cold. But when the clouds rose, their density\r\nrendered respiration difficult: snow and hail fell continually, and the\r\nwinds returned with such violence, that it was impossible to overcome\r\nthe fear of being blown down the precipices, or of being buried by the\r\naccumulation of ice and snow, or by the enormous fragments of rocks\r\nwhich rolled around them. Every crevice in their hut was stopped, and\r\nthough the hut was small, was crowded with inhabitants, and several\r\nlamps were constantly burning, the cold was so great, that each\r\nindividual was obliged to have a chafing-dish of coals, and several men\r\nwere employed every morning in removing the snow which had fallen during\r\nthe night. Their feet were swollen, and they became so tender and\r\nsensible, that walking was attended with extreme pain; their hands also\r\nwere covered with chilblains, and their lips were so swollen and\r\nchapped, that every motion in speaking brought blood.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              MOUNT ETNA.\r\n\r\n        “Now under sulphurous Cuma’s sea-bound coast,\r\n          And vast Sicilia, lies the shaggy breast\r\n        Of snowy Etna, nurse of endless frost,\r\n          The pillared prop of heaven, forever pressed:\r\n        Forth from whose sulph’rous caverns issuing rise\r\n          Pure liquid fountains of tempestuous fire,\r\n        Which vail in ruddy mists the noonday skies,\r\n          While wrapt in smoke the eddying flames aspire,\r\n        Or gleaming through the night with hideous roar,\r\n        Far o’er the redd’ning main huge rocky fragments pour.\r\n\r\n        “But he, Vulcanian monster, to the clouds\r\n          The fiercest, hottest inundations throws,\r\n        While, with the burthen of incumbent woods,\r\n          And Etna’s gloomy cliffs o’erwhelmed he glows.\r\n        There on his flinty bed outstretch’d he lies,\r\n          Whose pointed rock his tossing carcass wounds;\r\n        There with dismay he strikes beholding eyes,\r\n          Or frights the distant ear with horrid sounds.”—WEST.\r\n\r\nMount Etna, one of the most majestic of all the volcanoes, which the\r\nancients considered as one of the highest mountains in the world, and on\r\nthe summit of which they believed that Deucalion and Pyrrha sought\r\nrefuge, to save themselves from the universal deluge, is situated on the\r\nplain of Catania, in Sicily.\r\n\r\nIts elevation above the level of the sea has been estimated at ten\r\nthousand, nine hundred and sixty-three feet, or upward of two miles. On\r\nclear days it is distinctly seen from Valetta, the capital of Malta, a\r\ndistance of one hundred and fifty miles. It is incomparably the largest\r\nburning mountain in Europe. From its sides other mountains arise, which,\r\nin different ages, have been ejected in single masses from its enormous\r\ncrater. The most extensive lavas of Vesuvius do not exceed seven miles\r\nin length, while those of Etna extend to fifteen, twenty, and some even\r\nto thirty miles. The crater of Etna is seldom less than a mile in\r\ncircuit, and sometimes is two or three miles; but the circumference of\r\nthe Vesuvian crater is never more than half a mile, even when widely\r\ndistended, in its most destructive conflagrations. And, lastly, the\r\nearthquakes occasioned by these adjacent volcanoes, their eruptions,\r\ntheir showers of ignited stones, and the destruction and desolation\r\nwhich they create, are severally proportionate to their respective\r\ndimensions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CRATER OF MOUNT ETNA.]\r\n\r\nA journey up Etna is considered as an enterprise of importance, as well\r\nfrom the difficulty of the route, as from the distance, it being thirty\r\nmiles from Catania to the summit of the mountain. Its gigantic bulk, its\r\nsublime elevation, and the extensive, varied, and grand prospects which\r\nare presented from its summit, have, however, induced the curious in\r\nevery age to ascend and examine it; and not a few have transmitted,\r\nthrough the press, the observations which they have made during their\r\narduous journey. From its vast base it rises like a pyramid to the\r\nperpendicular hight of two miles, by an acclivity nearly equal on all\r\nsides, forming with the horizon an angle of about fifteen degrees, which\r\nbecomes greater on approaching the crater; but the inclination of the\r\nsteepest part of the cone nowhere exceeds an angle of forty-five\r\ndegrees. This prodigious volcano may be compared to a forge, which, in\r\nproportion to the violence of the fire, to the nature of the fossil\r\nmatters on which it acts, and of the gases which urge and set it in\r\nmotion, produces, destroys, and reproduces, a variety of forms; and of\r\nthis, as of all active volcanoes, we may say in the language of Young,\r\n\r\n             “The dread volcano ministers to good;\r\n             Its smothered flames might undermine the world\r\n             Loud Etnas fulminate in love to man.”\r\n\r\nThe top of Etna being above the common region of vapors, the heavens, at\r\nthis elevation, appear with an unusual splendor. Brydone and his company\r\nobserved, as they ascended in the night, that the number of the stars\r\nseemed to be infinitely increased, and the light of each was brighter\r\nthan usual. The whiteness of the milky way was like a pure flame which\r\nspread across the heavens; and, with the naked eye, they could observe\r\nclusters of stars which were invisible from below. They likewise noticed\r\nseveral of those meteors called falling stars, which appeared as much\r\nelevated here as when viewed from the plain beneath.\r\n\r\nThis single mountain contains an epitome of the different climates\r\nthroughout the world, presenting at once all the seasons of the year,\r\nand all the varieties of produce. It is accordingly divided into three\r\ndistinct zones or regions, which may be distinguished as the torrid,\r\ntemperate, and frigid, but which are known by the names of the\r\ncultivated region, the woody or temperate region, and the frigid or\r\ndesert region. The former of these extends through twelve miles of the\r\nascent toward the summit, and is almost incredibly abundant in pastures\r\nand fruit-trees of every description. It is covered with towns, villages\r\nand monasteries; and the number of inhabitants spread over its surface\r\nis estimated at one hundred and twenty thousand. In ascending to the\r\nwoody or temperate region, the scene changes; it is a new climate, a new\r\ncreation. Below, the heat is suffocating; but here, the air is mild and\r\nfresh. The turf is covered with aromatic plants; and the gulfs, which\r\nformerly ejected torrents of fire, are changed into woody valleys.\r\nNothing can be more picturesque than this; the inequality of the soil\r\ndisplaying every moment some variety of scene: here, the ash and\r\nflowering thorns form domes of verdure; and there, the chestnut-trees\r\ngrow to an enormous size. The one called =castagno de cento cavilli=,\r\naccording to Brydone and Glover, has a circumference of two hundred and\r\nfour feet. Many of the oaks also are of a prodigious size. Mr. Swinburne\r\nmeasured one which had a circumference of twenty-eight feet. The last,\r\nor desert region, commences more than a mile above the level of the sea.\r\nThe lower part is covered with snow in winter only; but on the upper\r\nhalf of this sterile district the snows continually lie.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE “CASTAGNO DE CENTO CAVILLI,” OR GREAT CHESTNUT TREE\r\nOF MOUNT ETNA.]\r\n\r\nThe cone of Etna is, in a right line, about a mile in ascent. The crater\r\nis about a mile and a half in circumference; and from the inner part of\r\nthis, a column of smoke constantly rises; while the liquid fiery matter\r\nmay be seen rolling, rising and falling within. As to the vastness and\r\nbeauty of the prospect from the summit of Etna, all writers agree that\r\nit is probably unsurpassed. M. Houel was there at sunrise, when the\r\nhorizon was perfectly clear, and the coast of Calabria, as seen in the\r\ndistance, appeared to the eye misty, and undistinguishable from the sea.\r\nThe sky above was specked with the light floating clouds that are so\r\noften seen in that delightful climate before the rising of the sun; and\r\nin the calm silence all nature seemed waiting the coming of the orb of\r\nday. And very soon the promise thus given began to be fulfilled. In a\r\nshort time a fiery radiance appeared in the east. The fleecy clouds were\r\ntinged with purple; the atmosphere became strongly illuminated, and,\r\nreflecting the rays of the sun, seemed to be filled with a bright\r\nrefulgence of flame. Although the heavens were thus enlightened, the sea\r\nstill retained its dark azure, and the fields and forests did not yet\r\nreflect the rays of the sun. The gradual rising of this luminary,\r\nhowever, soon diffused light over the hills which lie below the peak of\r\nEtna. This last stood like an island in the midst of the ocean, with\r\nluminous points multiplying every moment around, and spreading over a\r\nwider extent with the greatest rapidity. It was, he said, as if the\r\nworld had been observed suddenly to spring from the night of\r\nnon-existence.\r\n\r\n                          “Ere the rising sun\r\n          Shone o’er the deep, or ’mid the vault of night\r\n          The moon her silver lamp suspended; ere\r\n          The vales with springs were watered, or with groves\r\n          Of oak or pine the ancient hills were crowned;\r\n          Then the Great Spirit, whom his works adore,\r\n          Within his own deep essence viewed the forms,\r\n          The forms eternal of created things:\r\n          The radiant sun; the moon’s nocturnal lamp;\r\n          The mountains and the streams: the ample stores\r\n          Of earth, of heaven, of nature. From the first,\r\n          On that full scene his love divine he fixed,\r\n          His admiration. Till, in time complete,\r\n          What he admired and loved, his vital power\r\n          Unfolded into being. Hence the breath\r\n          Of life, informing each organic frame;\r\n          Hence the green earth, and wild resounding waves;\r\n          Hence light and shade, alternate; warmth and cold;\r\n          And bright autumnal skies, and vernal showers,\r\n          And all the fair variety of things.”—AKENSIDE.\r\n\r\nThe most sublime object, however, which the summit of Etna presents, is\r\nthe immense mass of its own colossal body. Its upper region exhibits\r\nrough and craggy cliffs, rising perpendicularly, fearful to the view,\r\nand surrounded by an assemblage of fugitive clouds, to increase the wild\r\nvariety of the scene. Amid the multitude of woods in the middle or\r\ntemperate region, are numerous mountains, which, in any other situation,\r\nwould appear of a gigantic size, but which, compared to Etna, are mere\r\nmole-hills. Lastly, the eye contemplates with admiration the lower\r\nregion, the most extensive of the three, adorned with elegant villas and\r\ncastles, verdant hills and flowery fields, and terminated by the\r\nextensive coast, where to the south stands the beautiful city of\r\nCatania, to which the waves of the neighboring sea serve as a mirror.\r\n\r\nEtna has been celebrated as a volcano from the remotest antiquity.\r\nEruptions are recorded by Diodorus Siculus, as having happened five\r\nhundred years before the Trojan war, or sixteen hundred and ninety-three\r\nyears before the Christian era.\r\n\r\n                    “Etna roars with dreadful ruins nigh,\r\n          Now hurls a bursting cloud of cinders high,\r\n          Involved in smoky whirlwinds to the sky;\r\n          With loud displosion to the starry frame,\r\n          Shoots fiery globes, and furious floods of flame:\r\n          Now from her bellowing caverns burst away\r\n          Vast piles of melted rocks in open day.\r\n          Her shattered entrails wide the mountain throws,\r\n          And deep as hell her flaming center glows.”—WARTON.\r\n\r\nIn 1669, the torrent of burning lava inundated a space fourteen miles in\r\nlength, and four in breadth, burying beneath it part of Catania, till at\r\nlength it precipitated itself into the sea. For several months before\r\nthe lava broke out, the old mouth, or great crater of the summit, was\r\nobserved to send forth much smoke and flame, and the top had fallen in,\r\nso that the mountain was much lowered.\r\n\r\nEighteen days before, the sky was very thick and dark, with thunder,\r\nlightning, frequent concussions of the earth, and dreadful subterraneous\r\nbellowings. On the eleventh of March, about sunset, an immense gulf\r\nopened in the mountain, into which when stones were thrown, they could\r\nnot be heard to strike the bottom. Ignited rocks, fifteen feet in\r\nlength, were hurled to the distance of a mile; while others of a smaller\r\nsize were carried three miles. During the night, the red-hot lava burst\r\nout of a vineyard twenty miles below the great crater, and ascended into\r\nthe air to a considerable hight. In its course, it destroyed five\r\nthousand habitations, and filled up a lake several fathoms deep. It\r\nshortly after reached Catania, rose over the walls, whence it ran for a\r\nconsiderable length into the sea, forming a safe and beautiful harbor,\r\nwhich was, however, soon filled up by a similar torrent of inflamed\r\nmatter. This is the stream, the hideous deformity of which, devoid of\r\nvegetation, still disfigures the south and western borders of Catania,\r\nand on which part of the noble modern city is built.\r\n\r\nThe showers of scoriæ and sand which, after a lapse of two days,\r\nfollowed this eruption, formed a mountain called Monte Rosso, having a\r\nbase of about two miles, and a perpendicular hight of seven hundred and\r\nfifty feet. On the twenty-fifth, the whole mountain, even to the most\r\nelevated peak, was agitated by a tremendous earthquake. The highest\r\ncrater of Etna, which was one of the loftiest parts of the mountain,\r\nthen sunk into the volcanic gulf, and in the place which it had\r\noccupied, there now appeared nothing but a wide gulf, more than a mile\r\nin extent, from which issued enormous quantities of smoke, ashes and\r\nstones.\r\n\r\nIn 1809, twelve new craters opened about half-way down the mountain, and\r\nthrew out rivers of burning lava, by which several estates were covered\r\nto the depth of thirty or forty feet; and during three or four\r\nsuccessive nights, a very large river of red-hot lava was distinctly\r\nseen, in its whole extent, running down from the mountain.\r\n\r\nIn 1811, several mouths opened on the eastern side of the mountain:\r\nbeing nearly in the same line, and at equal distances, they presented to\r\nthe view a striking spectacle; torrents of burning matter, discharged\r\nwith the greatest force from the interior of the volcano, illuminated\r\nthe horizon to a great extent. An immense quantity of matter, which was\r\ndriven to considerable distances, was discharged from these apertures,\r\nthe largest of which continued for several months to emit torrents of\r\nfire. Even at the time when it had the appearance of being choked, there\r\nsuddenly issued from it clouds of ashes, which descended, in the form of\r\nrain, on the city of Catania and its environs, as well as on the fields\r\nsituated at a very considerable distance. A roaring, resembling that of\r\na sea in the midst of a tempest, was heard to proceed from the interior\r\nof the mountain; and this sound, accompanied from time to time by\r\ndreadful explosions, resembling thunder, reëchoed through the valleys,\r\nand spread terror on every side.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            MOUNT VESUVIUS.\r\n\r\n                          “The fluid lake that works below,\r\n            Bitumen, sulphur, salt, and iron scum,\r\n            Heaves up its boiling tide. The lab’ring mount\r\n            Is torn with agonizing throes. At once,\r\n            Forth from its sides disparted, blazing pours\r\n            A mighty river; burning in prone waves,\r\n            That glimmer through the night, to yonder plain.\r\n            Divided there, a hundred torrent streams,\r\n            Each plowing up its bed, roll dreadful on,\r\n            Resistless. Villages, and woods, and rocks,\r\n            Fall flat before their sweep. The region round,\r\n            Where myrtle-walks and groves of golden fruit\r\n            Rose fair; where harvest wav’d in all its pride;\r\n            And where the vineyard spread its purple store,\r\n            Maturing into nectar; now despoiled\r\n            Of herb, leaf, fruit and flower, from end to end\r\n            Lies buried under fire, a glowing sea!”—MALLET.\r\n\r\nThis celebrated volcano, which has for so many ages attracted the\r\nattention of mankind, and the desolating eruptions of which have been so\r\noften and so fatally experienced, is distant, in an eastern direction,\r\nabout seven miles from Naples. It rises, insulated, upon a vast and well\r\ncultivated plain, presenting two summits on the same base, in which\r\nparticular it resembles Mount Parnassus. One of these, La Somma, is\r\ngenerally agreed to have been the Vesuvius of Strabo and the ancients;\r\nthe other, having the greatest elevation, is the mouth of the volcano,\r\nwhich almost constantly emits smoke. Its hight above the level of the\r\nsea, is thirty-nine hundred feet, and it may be ascended by three\r\ndifferent routes, which are all very steep and difficult, from the\r\nconical form of the mountain, and the loose ashes which slip from under\r\nthe feet: still, from the base to the summit, the distance is not more\r\nthan three Italian miles. The circumference of the platform on the top,\r\nis five thousand and twenty-four feet, or nearly a mile. Thence may be\r\nseen Portici, Capræa, Ischia, Pausilippo, and the whole coast of the\r\ngulf of Naples, bordered with orange-trees: the prospect is that of\r\nParadise seen from the infernal regions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MOUNT VESUVIUS.]\r\n\r\nOn approaching the mountain, its aspect does not convey any impression\r\nof terror, nor is it gloomy, being cultivated for more than two-thirds\r\nof its hight, and having its brown top alone barren. There all verdure\r\nceases; yet, when it appears covered with clouds, which sometimes\r\nencompass its middle only, this circumstance rather adds to than\r\ndetracts from the magnificence of the spectacle. Upon the lavas which\r\nthe volcano long ago ejected, and which, like great furrows, extend into\r\nthe plain and to the sea, are built houses, villages and towns. Gardens,\r\nvineyards and cultivated fields surround them; but a sentiment of\r\nsorrow, blended with apprehensions about the future, arises on the\r\nrecollection that, beneath a soil so fruitful and so smiling, lie\r\nedifices, gardens and whole towns swallowed up. Portici rests upon\r\nHerculaneum; its environs upon Resina; and at a little distance is\r\nPompeii, in the streets of which, after more than seventeen centuries of\r\nnon-existence, the astonished traveler now walks. After a long interval\r\nof repose, in the first year of the reign of Titus, (the seventy-ninth\r\nof the Christian era,) the volcano suddenly broke out, ejecting thick\r\nclouds of ashes and pumice-stones, beneath which Herculaneum, Stabia and\r\nPompeii were completely buried. This eruption was fatal to the elder\r\nPliny, the historian, who fell a victim to his humanity and love of\r\nscience. Even at this day, in speaking of Vesuvius, the remembrance of\r\nhis untimely death excites a melancholy regret. All the coast to the\r\neast of the gulf of Naples was, on the above occasion, ravaged and\r\ndestroyed, presenting nothing but a long succession of ejected matters\r\nfrom Herculaneum to Stabia. The destruction did not extend to the\r\nwestern part, but stopped at Naples, which suffered comparatively\r\nlittle.\r\n\r\nThirty-eight eruptions of Vesuvius are recorded in history up to the\r\nyear 1806. That of 1779, has been described by Sir William Hamilton, as\r\namong the most remarkable, from its extraordinary and terrific\r\nappearance. During the whole of July, the mountain was in a state of\r\nconsiderable fermentation, subterraneous explosions and rumbling noises\r\nbeing heard, and quantities of smoke thrown up with great violence,\r\nsometimes with red-hot stones, scoriæ, and ashes. On the fifth of\r\nAugust, the volcano was greatly agitated, a white sulphurous smoke,\r\napparently four times the hight and size of the volcano itself, issuing\r\nfrom the crater, at the same time that vast quantities of stones, &c.,\r\nwere thrown up to the supposed hight of two thousand feet. The liquid\r\nlava, having cleared the rim of the crater, flowed down the sides of the\r\nmountain to the distance of four miles. The air was darkened by showers\r\nof reddish ashes, blended with long filaments of a vitrified matter\r\nresembling glass.\r\n\r\nOn the seventh, at midnight, a fountain of fire shot up from the crater\r\nto an incredible hight, casting so bright a light, that the smallest\r\nobjects were clearly distinguishable at any place within six miles of\r\nthe volcano. On the following evening, after a tremendous explosion,\r\nwhich broke the windows of the houses at Portici, another fountain of\r\nliquid fire rose to the surprising hight of ten thousand feet, (nearly\r\ntwo miles,) while puffs of the blackest smoke accompanied the red-hot\r\nlava, interrupting its splendid brightness here and there by patches of\r\nthe darkest hue. The lava was partly directed by the wind toward\r\nOttaiano, on which so thick a shower of ashes, blended with vast pieces\r\nof scoriæ, fell, that had it been of longer continuance, that town would\r\nhave shared the fate of Pompeii. It took fire in several places; and had\r\nthere been much wind, the inhabitants would have been burned in their\r\nhouses, it being impossible for them to stir out. To add to the horror\r\nof the scene, incessant volcanic lightning darted through the black\r\ncloud that surrounded them, while the sulphureous smell and heat would\r\nscarcely allow them to draw their breath. In this dreadful state they\r\nremained nearly half an hour. The remaining part of the lava, still\r\nred-hot and liquid, fell on the top of Vesuvius, and covered its whole\r\ncone, together with that of La Somma, and the valley between them, thus\r\nforming one complete body of fire, which could not be less than two\r\nmiles and a half in breadth, and casting a heat to the distance of at\r\nleast six miles around.\r\n\r\nThe eruption of 1794 is accurately described by the above writer; but\r\nhas not an equal degree of interest with the one cited above. We subjoin\r\na few particulars, among which is a circumstance well deserving notice,\r\nas it leads to an estimate of the degree of heat in volcanoes. Sir\r\nWilliam says that although the town of Torre del Greco was instantly\r\nsurrounded with red-hot lava, the inhabitants saved themselves by coming\r\nout of the tops of their houses on the following day. It is evident,\r\nobserves Mr. Kirwan, that if this lava had been hot enough to melt even\r\nthe most fusible stones, these persons must have been suffocated.\r\n\r\nThis eruption happened on the fifteenth of June, at ten o’clock at\r\nnight, and was announced by a shock of an earthquake, which was\r\ndistinctly felt at Naples. At the same moment a fountain of bright fire,\r\nattended with a very black smoke and a loud report, was seen to issue,\r\nand rise to a considerable hight, from about the middle of the cone of\r\nVesuvius. It was hastily succeeded by other fountains, fifteen of which\r\nwere counted, all in a direct line, tending for the space of about a\r\nmile and a half downward, toward the towns of Resina and Torre del\r\nGreco. This fiery scene, this great operation of nature, was accompanied\r\nby the loudest thunder, the incessant reports of which, like those of a\r\nnumerous heavy artillery, were attended by a continued hollow murmur,\r\nsimilar to that of the roaring of the ocean during a violent storm.\r\nAnother blowing noise resembled that of the ascent of a large flight of\r\nrockets. The houses at Naples were for several hours in a constant\r\ntremor, the doors and windows shaking and rattling incessantly, and the\r\nbells ringing. At this awful moment the sky, from a bright full moon and\r\nstarlight, became obscured; the moon seemed eclipsed, and was soon lost\r\nin obscurity. The murmur of the prayers and lamentations of a numerous\r\npopulation, forming various processions, and parading the streets, added\r\nto the horrors of the scene.\r\n\r\nOn the following day a new mouth was opened on the opposite side of the\r\nmountain, facing the town of Ottaiano: from this aperture a considerable\r\nstream of lava issued, and ran with great velocity through a wood, which\r\nit burnt; but it stopped, after having run about three miles in a few\r\nhours, before it reached the vineyards and cultivated lands. The lava\r\nwhich had flowed from several new mouths on the south side of the\r\nmountain, reached the sea into which it ran, after having overwhelmed,\r\nburnt and destroyed the greater part of Torre del Greco, through the\r\ncenter of which it took its course. This town contained about eighteen\r\nthousand inhabitants, all of whom escaped, with the exception of about\r\nfifteen, who through age or infirmity, were overwhelmed in their houses\r\nby the lava. Its rapid progress was such, that their goods and effects\r\nwere entirely abandoned.\r\n\r\nIt was ascertained some time after, that a considerable part of the\r\ncrater had fallen in, so as to have given a great extension to the mouth\r\nof Vesuvius, which was conjectured to be nearly two miles in\r\ncircumference. This sinking of the crater was chiefly on the west side,\r\nopposite Naples, and, in all probability, occurred early in the morning\r\nof the eighteenth, when a violent shock of an earthquake was felt at\r\nResina, and other places situated at the foot of the volcano. The clouds\r\nof smoke which issued from the now widely extended mouth of Vesuvius,\r\nwere of such a density as to appear to force their passage with the\r\nutmost difficulty. One cloud heaped itself on another, and, succeeding\r\neach other incessantly, they formed in a few hours such a gigantic and\r\nelevated column, of the darkest hue, over the mountain, as seemed to\r\nthreaten Naples with immediate destruction, it having at one time been\r\nbent over the city, and appearing to be much too massive and ponderous\r\nto remain long suspended in the air.\r\n\r\nFrom the above time, till 1804, Vesuvius remained in a state of almost\r\nconstant tranquillity. Symptoms of a fresh eruption had manifested\r\nthemselves for several months, when at length on the night of the\r\neleventh of August, a deep roaring was heard at the hermitage of\r\nSalvador, and the places adjacent to the mountain, accompanied by shocks\r\nof an earthquake, which were sensibly felt at Resina. On the following\r\nmorning, at noon, a thick black smoke rose from the mouth of the crater,\r\nwhich, dilating prodigiously, covered the whole volcano. In the evening,\r\nloud explosions were heard; and at Naples a column of fire was seen to\r\nrise from the aperture, carrying up stones in a state of complete\r\nignition, which fell again into the crater. The noise by which these\r\nigneous explosions were accompanied, resembled the roaring of the most\r\ndreadful tempest and the whistling of the most furious winds; while the\r\ncelerity with which the substances were ejected was such, that the first\r\nemission had not terminated when it was succeeded by a second. Small\r\nmonticules were at this time formed of a fluid matter, resembling a\r\nvitreous paste of a red color, which flowed from the mouth of the\r\ncrater; and these became more considerable in proportion as the matter\r\naccumulated.\r\n\r\nIn this state the eruption continued for several days, the fire being\r\nequally intense, with frequent and dreadful noises. On the\r\ntwenty-eighth, amid these fearful symptoms, another aperture, ejecting\r\nfire and stones, situated behind the crater, was seen from Naples. The\r\nburning mass of lava which escaped from the crater on the following day,\r\nwas distinguished from Torre del Greco, having the appearance of a\r\nvitreous fluid, and advancing toward the base of the mountain between\r\nthe south and south-west. It reached the base on the thirtieth, having\r\nflowed from the aperture, in less than twenty-four hours, a distance of\r\nthree thousand and fifty-three feet, while its mean breadth appeared to\r\nbe about three hundred and fifty, but at the base, eight hundred and\r\nsixty feet. In its course it divided into four branches, and finally\r\nreached a spot called the Guide’s Retreat. Its entire progress to this\r\npoint was more than a mile, so that, taking a mean proportion, this lava\r\nflowed at the rate of eighty-six feet an hour.\r\n\r\nAt the time of this eruption, Kotzebue was at Naples. Vesuvius lay\r\nopposite to his window, and when it was dark he could clearly perceive\r\nin what manner the masses of fire rolled down the mountain. As long as\r\nany glimmering of light remained, that part of the mountain was to be\r\nseen on the declivity of which the lava formed a straight but oblique\r\nline. As soon, however, as it was perfectly dark, and the mountain\r\nitself had vanished from the eye, it seemed as if a comet with a long\r\ntail stood in the sky. The spectacle was awful and grand!\r\n\r\nKotzebue ascended the mountain on the morning succeeding the opening of\r\na new gulf, and approached the crater as nearly as prudence would allow.\r\nFrom its center ascended the sulphurous yellow cone which the eruption\r\nof this year had formed: on the other side, a thick smoke perpetually\r\narose from the abyss opened during the preceding night. The side of the\r\ncrater opposite to him, which rose considerably higher than that on\r\nwhich he stood, afforded a singular aspect; for it was covered with\r\nlittle pillars of smoke, which burst forth from it, and had some\r\nresemblance to extinguished lights. The air over the crater was actually\r\nembodied, and was clearly to be seen in a tremulous motion. Below, the\r\nvolcano boiled and roared dreadfully, like the most violent hurricane;\r\nbut occasionally a sudden deadly stillness ensued for some moments,\r\nafter which the roaring renewed with double vehemence, and the smoke\r\nburst forth in thicker and blacker clouds. It was, he observes, as if\r\nthe spirit of the mountain had suddenly tried to stop the gulf, while\r\nthe flames indignantly refused to endure the confinement.\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable, that the great eruption of 1805, happened on the\r\ntwelfth of August, within a day of that of the preceding year.\r\nSubterraneous noises had been previously heard, and a general\r\napprehension of some violent commotion prevailing, the inhabitants of\r\nTorre del Greco and Annunciada had left their homes, through the\r\napprehension of a shower of fire and ashes, similar to that which buried\r\nPompeii. The stream of lava took the same course with that of 1794,\r\ndescribed above, one of the arms following the direction of the great\r\nroad, and rolling toward the sea. The stream soon divided again, and\r\nspreading itself with an increased celerity, swept away many houses and\r\nthe finest plantations. The other branch, at first, took the direction\r\nof Portici, which was threatened; but turning, and joining the preceding\r\none, formed a sort of islet of boiling lava in the middle, both ending\r\nin the sea, and composing a promontory of volcanic matters. In the space\r\nof twenty minutes the whole extent of ground which the lava occupied was\r\non fire, offering a terrible yet singular spectacle, as the burning\r\ntrees presented the aspect of white flames, in contrast with those of\r\nthe volcanic matters, which were red. The lava swept along with it\r\nenormous masses of whatever occurred in its course, and, on its reaching\r\nthe sea, nothing was to be seen or heard for a great extent of shore,\r\nbeside the boiling and hissing arising from the conflict of the water\r\nand fire.\r\n\r\nIt remains now to introduce a slight notice of the eruption of 1806,\r\nwhich, without any sensible indication, took place on the evening of the\r\nthirty-first of May, when a bright flame rose from the mountain to the\r\nhight of about six hundred feet, sinking and rising alternately, and\r\naffording so clear a light, that a letter might have been read at the\r\ndistance of a league around the mountain. On the following morning,\r\nwithout any earthquake preceding, as had been customary, the volcano\r\nbegan to eject inflamed substances from three new mouths, pretty near to\r\neach other, and about six hundred and fifty feet from the summit. The\r\nlava took the direction of Torre del Greco and Annunciada, approaching\r\nPortici, on the road leading from Naples to Pompeii. Throughout the\r\nwhole of the second of June, a noise was heard, resembling that of two\r\narmies engaged, when the discharges of artillery and musketry are very\r\nbrisk. The current of lava now resembled a wall of glass in a state of\r\nfusion, sparks and flashes issuing from it from time to time, with a\r\npowerful detonation. Vines, trees, houses—whatever objects, in short, it\r\nencountered on its way, were instantly overthrown or destroyed. In one\r\npart, where it met with the resistance of a wall, it formed a cascade of\r\nfire. In a few days Portici, Resina, and Torre del Greco, were covered\r\nwith ashes thrown out by the volcano; and on the ninth, the two former\r\nplaces were deluged with a thick black rain, consisting of a species of\r\nmud filled with sulphurous particles. On the first of July, the ancient\r\ncrater had wholly disappeared, being filled with ashes and lava, and a\r\nnew one was formed in the eastern part of the mountain, about six\r\nhundred feet in depth, and having about the same width at the opening.\r\nSeveral persons, on the above day, descended about half-way down this\r\nnew mouth, and remained half an hour very near the flames, admiring the\r\nspectacle presented by the liquid lava, which bubbled up at the bottom\r\nof the crater, like the fused matter in a glass-house. This eruption\r\ncontinued until September, made great ravages, and was considered as one\r\nof the most terrible that had occurred in the memory of the inhabitants.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              MOUNT HECLA.\r\n\r\n                          [See cut, page 29.]\r\n\r\n          “Still pressing on beneath Tornea’s lake,\r\n          And Hecla flaming through a waste of snow,\r\n          And farthest Greenland, to the pole itself,\r\n          Where, falling gradual, life at length goes out,\r\n          The Muse expands her solitary flight;\r\n          And hov’ring o’er the wide stupendous scene,\r\n          Beholds new scenes beneath another sky.\r\n          Throned in his palace of cerulean ice,\r\n          Here Winter holds his unrejoicing court,\r\n          And through his airy hall the loud misrule\r\n          Of driving tempest is forever heard;\r\n          Here the grim tyrant meditates his wrath;\r\n          Here arms his winds with all-subduing frost,\r\n          Molds his fierce hail, and treasures up his snows.”\r\n\r\nOn proceeding along the southern coast of Iceland, and at an\r\ninconsiderable distance from Skalholt, Mount Hecla, with its three\r\nsummits, presents itself to the view. Its hight is five thousand feet,\r\nor nearly a mile above the level of the sea. It is not a promontory, but\r\nlies about four miles inland. It is neither so elevated nor so\r\npicturesque as several of the surrounding Icelandic mountains; but has\r\nbeen more noticed than many other volcanoes of an equal extent, partly\r\nthrough the frequency of its eruptions, and partly from its situation,\r\nwhich exposes it to the view of many ships sailing to Greenland and\r\nNorth America. The surrounding territory has been so devastated by these\r\neruptions, that it has been deserted.\r\n\r\n           “Vast regions dreary, bleak and bare!\r\n           There on an icy mountain’s hight,\r\n           Seen only by the moon’s pale light\r\n           Stern Winter rears his giant form,\r\n           His robe a mist, his life a storm:\r\n           His frown the shiv’ring nations fly,\r\n           And, hid for half the year, in smoky caverns lie.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MOUNT HECLA AND THE GEYSERS.]\r\n\r\nThe natives assert that it is impossible to ascend the mountain, on\r\naccount of the great number of dangerous bogs, which, according to them,\r\nare constantly emitting sulphurous flames and exhaling smoke; while the\r\nmore elevated summit in the center is covered with boiling springs and\r\nlarge craters, which continually propel fire and smoke. To the south and\r\nwest the environs present the most desolating results of frequent\r\neruptions, the finest part of the territory being covered by torrents of\r\nmelted stone, sand, ashes, and other volcanic matter; notwithstanding\r\nwhich, between the sinuosities of the lava in different parts, some\r\nportion of meadows, walls and broken hedges may be observed. The\r\ndevastation is still greater on the north and east sides, which present\r\ndreadful traces of the ruin of the country and its habitations. Neither\r\nplants nor grass are to be met with to the extent of two leagues round\r\nthe mountain, in consequence of the soil being covered with stones and\r\nlava; and in some parts, where the subterraneous fire has broken out a\r\nsecond time, or where the matter which was not entirely consumed has\r\nagain become ignited, the fire has contributed to form small red and\r\nblack hillocks and eminences, from scoriæ, pumice-stones and ashes. The\r\nnearer the mountain the larger are these hillocks, and there are some of\r\nthem, the summits of which form a circular hollow, whence the\r\nsubterraneous fire ejects the matter. On approaching Hecla the ground\r\nbecomes almost impassable, particularly near the higher branches of lava\r\nthrown from the volcano. Round the latter is a mountain of lava,\r\nconsisting of large fused stones, from forty to seventy feet high, and\r\nin the form of a rampart or wall. These stones are detached, and chiefly\r\ncovered with moss; while between them are very deep holes, so that the\r\nascent on the western side requires great circumspection. The rocks are\r\ncompletely reduced to pumice, dispersed in thin horizontal layers, and\r\nfractured in every direction, from which some idea may be formed of the\r\nintensity of the fire that has acted on them.\r\n\r\n            “There Winter, armed with terrors here unknown,\r\n            Sits absolute on his unshaken throne;\r\n            Piles up his stores amidst the frozen waste,\r\n            And bids the mountains he has built stand fast;\r\n            Beckons the legions of his storms away\r\n            From happier scenes to make the land a prey;\r\n            Proclaims the soil a conquest he has won,\r\n            And scorns to share it with the distant sun.”\r\n\r\nSir Joseph Banks, Dr. Solander, Dr. James Lind, of Edinburgh, and Dr.\r\nVan Troil, a Swede, were the earliest adventurous travelers who ascended\r\nto the summit of Mount Hecla. This was in 1772; and the attempt was\r\nfacilitated by a preceding eruption in 1766, which had greatly\r\ndiminished the steepness and difficulty of the ascent. On their first\r\nlanding, they found a tract of land sixty or seventy miles in extent,\r\nentirely ruined by lava, which appeared to have been in a state of\r\ncomplete liquefaction. To accomplish their undertaking, they had to\r\ntravel from three hundred to three hundred and sixty miles over\r\nuninterrupted tracts of lava. In ascending, they were obliged to quit\r\ntheir horses at the first opening from which the fire had burst: a spot,\r\nwhich they describe as presenting lofty glazed walls and high glazed\r\ncliffs, differing from anything they had ever seen before. At another\r\nopening above, they fancied they discerned the effects of boiling water;\r\nand not far from thence, the mountain, with the exception of some bare\r\nspots, was covered with snow. The difference of aspect they soon\r\nperceived to be occasioned by the hot vapor ascending from the mountain.\r\nThe higher they proceeded, the larger these spots became; and, about two\r\nhundred yards below the summit, a hole about a yard and a half in\r\ndiameter, was observed, whence issued so hot a stream, that they could\r\nnot measure the degree of heat with a thermometer. The cold now began to\r\nbe very intense. Fahrenheit’s thermometer, which at the foot of the\r\nmountain was at fifty-four degrees, fell to twenty-four degrees; while\r\nthe wind became so violent, that they were sometimes obliged to lie\r\ndown, from a dread of being blown into the most dreadful precipices. On\r\nthe summit itself they experienced, at one and the same time, a high\r\ndegree of heat and cold; for, in the air, Fahrenheit’s thermometer\r\nconstantly stood at twenty-four degrees, but when placed on the ground,\r\nit rose to one hundred and fifty-three degrees.\r\n\r\nMessrs. Olafsen and Povelsen, two naturalists, whose travels in Iceland\r\nwere undertaken by order of his Danish majesty, after a fatiguing\r\njourney up several small slopes, which occurred at intervals, and seven\r\nof which they had to pass, at length reached the summit of Mount Hecla\r\nat midnight. It was as light as at noonday, so that they had a view of\r\nan immense extent, but could perceive nothing but ice; neither fissures,\r\nstreams of water, boiling springs, smoke, nor fire, were apparent. They\r\nsurveyed the glaciers in the eastern part, and in the distance saw the\r\nhigh and square mountain of Hærdabreid, an ancient volcano, which\r\nappeared like a large castle.\r\n\r\nSir G. S. Mackenzie, in his travels in Iceland, ascended Mount Hecla;\r\nand from his account we extract the following interesting particulars.\r\nIn proceeding to the southern extremity of the mountain, he descended,\r\nby a dangerous path, into a valley, having a small lake in one corner,\r\nand the opposite extremity bounded by a perpendicular face of rock,\r\nresembling, in its broken and rugged appearance, a stream of lava. While\r\nadvancing, the sun suddenly broke through the clouds, and the brilliant\r\nreflection of his beams, from different parts of this supposed lava, as\r\nif from a surface of glass, delighted our traveler by the instantaneous\r\nconviction that he had now attained one of the principal objects\r\nconnected with the plan of his expedition to Iceland. He hastened to the\r\nspot, and all his wishes were fully accomplished in the examination of\r\nan object which greatly exceeded the expectations he had formed. On\r\nascending one of the abrupt pinnacles, which rose out of this\r\nextraordinary mass of rock, he beheld a region, the desolation of which\r\ncan scarcely be paralleled. Fantastic groups of hills, craters, and\r\nlava, leading the eye to distant snow-crowned “jockuls,” (inferior\r\nmountains,) the mist rising from a waterfall; lakes, embosomed among\r\nbleak mountains; an awful profound silence; lowering clouds; marks all\r\naround of the furious action of the most destructive of elements; all\r\ncombined to impress the soul with sensations of dread and wonder. The\r\nlonger he and his companions contemplated this scene, the more unable\r\nthey were to turn their eyes from it; and a considerable time elapsed\r\nbefore they could bring themselves to attend to the business which had\r\ntempted them to enter so frightful a district of the country.\r\n\r\nHaving proceeded a considerable distance along the edge of a stream of\r\nlava, a narrow part of which they crossed, they gained the foot of the\r\nsouth end of Mount Hecla. While, in ascending, they had to pass over\r\nrugged lava, they experienced no great difficulty in advancing; but when\r\nthey reached the steepest part of the mountain, which was covered with\r\nloose slags, they sometimes lost at one step by the yielding of these, a\r\nspace which had been gained by several.\r\n\r\nHaving passed a number of fissures, by leaping across some, and stepping\r\nalong masses of slags which lay over others, they at length reached the\r\nsummit of the first peak. The clouds now became so thick, that they\r\nbegan to despair of being able to proceed any further: it was, indeed,\r\ndangerous even to move; for the peak consists of a very narrow ridge of\r\nslags, not more than two feet broad, having a precipice on each side,\r\nseveral hundred feet in depth. One of these precipices forms the side of\r\na vast hollow, which seems to have been one of the craters. At length\r\nthe sky cleared a little, and enabled them to discover a ridge below,\r\nwhich seemed to connect the peak they had ascended with the middle or\r\nprincipal one. They lost no time in availing themselves of this\r\nopportunity, and, by balancing themselves like rope-dancers, succeeded\r\nin passing along a ridge of slags, so narrow that there was scarcely\r\nroom for their feet. After a short, but very steep ascent, they gained\r\nthe highest part of this celebrated mountain.\r\n\r\nIts earliest eruption is said to have happened in 1004, since which time\r\nupward of twenty have occurred. That of 1693 was the most dreadful, and\r\noccasioned terrible devastations, the ashes having been thrown over the\r\nisland in every direction, to the distance of more than one hundred\r\nmiles. In 1728, a fire broke out among the surrounding lava; and also in\r\nthat to the west of the volcano, in 1754, which lasted for three days.\r\nThere has not been any eruption of lava since 1766; but for some years\r\nafter, flames issued from the volcano.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              THE GEYSERS.\r\n\r\n                         [See cut on page 29.]\r\n\r\n          “Nor stops the restless fluid, mounting still,\r\n          Though oft amid th’ irriguous vale of springs;\r\n          But to the mountain courted by the sand,\r\n          That leads it darkling on in faithful maze,\r\n          Far from the parent main, it boils again!\r\n          Fresh into day; and all the glittering hill\r\n          Is bright with spouting rills.\r\n          The crystal treasures of the liquid world,\r\n          Through the stirred sands a bubbling passage burst;\r\n          And welling out, around the middle steep,\r\n          Or from the bottoms of the bosomed hills,\r\n          In pure effusion flow.”—THOMSON.\r\n\r\nThese celebrated fountains, or hot spouting water springs, being nearly\r\nconnected with the operations of subterraneous fire, so visible in every\r\npart of Iceland, may be properly introduced after the description of\r\nMount Hecla, given above.\r\n\r\nThey are seldom very near the volcanoes, but are dispersed over the\r\nwhole country, and are even to be found on the summits of several of the\r\nice mountains. The largest and most remarkable of these is situated in a\r\nlarge field, about sixteen miles to the north of Skalholt. At a great\r\ndistance from it, on one side, are high mountains covered with ice, and\r\non the other Hecla is seen rising above the clouds, while opposite to it\r\nis a ridge of rocks, at the foot of which water from time to time rushes\r\nforth. At the distance of a mile and a half, a loud roaring noise is\r\nheard, like that of a torrent precipitated from stupendous rocks, each\r\nejection being accompanied by violent subterraneous detonations. The\r\ndepth of the opening from which the water rushes, has not been\r\nascertained; but some seconds elapse before a stone thrown in reaches\r\nthe surface. The Danish traveler, Olafsen, asserts, that the water rises\r\nas high as sixty fathoms: while Van Troil estimates the highest jet at\r\nnot more than sixty feet: the latter allows, however, that the jets may\r\nbe more elevated, particularly in bad weather. The greatness of the\r\nexplosive power is evinced by its not only preventing stones thrown in\r\nfrom sinking, but even forcing them up to a very great hight, together\r\nwith the water, and splitting the pebbles into a thousand pieces. The\r\nheat was found by Van Troil to be two hundred and twelve degrees of\r\nFahrenheit, the boiling point. The edges of the pipe or basin are\r\ncovered by a coarse stalactitic rind, and the water has been found to\r\nhave a petrifying quality. The opening is perfectly circular, in\r\ndiameter nineteen feet, and forms above, on the surface of the ground, a\r\nbasin fifty-nine feet in diameter, the edge of which is nine feet above\r\nthe orifice or hole.\r\n\r\nIn speaking of the Geysers, or hot spouting springs, Horrebow observes,\r\nthat if you fill a bottle at one of them, the water it contains will\r\nboil three or four times, at the same time with the water in the well.\r\nThe inhabitants boil their meat in it, by putting the meat in a vessel\r\nof cold water, which they place in the hot spring.\r\n\r\nSir G. S. Mackenzie, whose travels in Iceland we have already cited,\r\nvisited the Geysers at a season favorable to his observations, the\r\nlatter end of July. He found the cultivation of the surrounding\r\nterritory much higher than might have been inferred from the idea\r\ngenerally entertained of the barren and unproductive state of Iceland.\r\nAll the flat ground in that quarter of the island was swampy, but not so\r\nmuch so as to impede the progress of the party, who, having passed\r\nseveral hot springs to the eastward of Skalholt, and others rising among\r\nthe low hills they had left to the right, in proceeding to the great\r\nGeyser, came to a farm-house, situated on a rising ground in the midst\r\nof the bogs. Here the people were busily employed in making hay, a scene\r\nwhich afforded a pleasing change from the dreary solitude they had\r\nquitted. The whole of this extensive district, which abounds in grass,\r\nwould, if drained, our traveler observes, prove a very rich pasture\r\ncountry. Farther on they came to several cottages at the foot of the\r\nmountain, round which they turned, and came in sight of the hill having\r\nthe Geysers at one of its sides. This hill, in hight not more than three\r\nhundred feet, is separated from the mountain, toward the west, by a\r\nnarrow slip of flat boggy ground, connected with that which extends over\r\nthe whole valley. Having crossed this bog, and a small river which ran\r\nthrough it, the party came to a farm-house at the east end of the hill,\r\nand arrived at a spot where the most wonderful and awful effects of\r\nsubterraneous heat are exhibited.\r\n\r\nOn the east side of the hill there are several banks of clay, from some\r\nof which steam rises in different places; and in others there are\r\ncavities, in which water boils briskly. In a few of these cavities, the\r\nwater being mixed with clay, is thick and varies in color; but is\r\nchiefly red and gray. Below these banks there is a gentle and uniform\r\nslope, composed of matter which, at some distant period, has been\r\ndeposited by springs which no longer exist. The strata or beds thus\r\nformed, seemed to have been broken by shocks of earthquakes,\r\nparticularly near the great Geyser. Within a space not exceeding a\r\nquarter of a mile, numerous orifices are seen in the old incrustations,\r\nfrom which boiling water and steam issue, with different degrees of\r\nforce. At the northern extremity is situated the great Geyser,\r\nsufficiently distinguishable from the others by every circumstance\r\nconnected with it. On approaching this spot, it appeared that a mount\r\nhad been formed of irregular, rough-looking depositions, upon the\r\nancient regular strata, the origin of which had been similar. The slope\r\nof the latter has caused the mount to spread more on the east side; and\r\nthe recent depositions of the water may be traced till they coincide\r\nwith them. The perpendicular hight of the mount is about seven feet,\r\nmeasured from the highest part of the surface of the old depositions.\r\nFrom these the matter composing the mount may be readily distinguished,\r\non the west side, where a disruption has taken place. On the top of this\r\nmount is a basin, which was found to extend fifty-six feet in one\r\ndirection, and forty-six in another.\r\n\r\nAt a quarter before three o’clock in the afternoon, when the party\r\nreached the spot, they found the basin full of hot water, a little of\r\nwhich was running over. Having satisfied their curiosity at that time,\r\nthey proceeded to examine some other places, whence they saw water\r\nascending. Above the great Geyser, at a short distance, they came to a\r\nlarge irregular opening, the beauties of which, the writer observes, it\r\nis hardly possible to describe. The water with which it was filled was\r\nas clear as crystal, and perfectly still, although nearly at the boiling\r\npoint. Through it they saw white incrustations, forming a variety of\r\nfigures and cavities, to a great depth, and carrying the eye into a vast\r\nand dark abyss, over which the crust supporting them formed a dome of an\r\ninconsiderable thickness; a circumstance which though not of itself\r\nagreeable, contributed much to the effects of this awful scene.\r\n\r\nHaving pitched their tent at the distance of about one hundred yards\r\nfrom the Geyser, and so arranged matters that a regular watch might be\r\nkept during the night, Sir G. S. Mackenzie took his station at eleven\r\no’clock, and his companions lay down to sleep. About ten minutes before\r\ntwelve he heard subterraneous discharges, and waked his friends. The\r\nwater in the basin was greatly agitated, and flowed over, but there was\r\nnot any jet. The same occurred at half past two. At five minutes past\r\nfour on Saturday morning, an alarm was given by one of the company. As\r\nour traveler lay next the door of the tent, he instantly drew aside the\r\ncanvas, when at the distance of little more than fifty yards, a most\r\nextraordinary and magnificent appearance presented itself. From a place\r\nthey had not before noticed, they saw water thrown up, and steam issuing\r\nwith a tremendous noise. There was little water; but the force with\r\nwhich the steam escaped, produced a white column of spray and vapor, at\r\nleast sixty feet high. They enjoyed this astonishing and beautiful sight\r\nuntil seven o’clock, when it gradually disappeared.\r\n\r\nThe remaining part of the morning was occupied in examining the environs\r\nof the Geysers; and at every step they received some new gratification.\r\nFollowing the channel which had been formed by the water escaping from\r\nthe great basin during the eruptions, they found several beautiful and\r\ndelicate petrifactions. The leaves of birch and willow were seen\r\nconverted into white stone, and in the most perfect state of\r\npreservation, every minute fiber being entire. Grass and rushes were in\r\nthe same state, and also masses of peat. Several of these rare and\r\nelegant specimens were brought safely to Great Britain. On the outside\r\nof the mount of the Geyser, the depositions, owing to the splashing of\r\nthe water, are rough and have been justly compared to the heads of\r\ncauliflowers. They are of a yellowish brown color, and are arranged\r\naround the mount, somewhat like a circular flight of steps. The inside\r\nof the basin is comparatively smooth: and the matter forming it is more\r\ncompact and dense than the exterior crust; when polished it is not\r\ndevoid of beauty, being of a gray color, mottled with black and white\r\nspots and streaks. The white incrustation formed by the water of the\r\nbeautiful cavity before described, had taken a very curious form at the\r\nwater’s edge, very much resembling the capital of a Gothic column.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         THE SULPHUR MOUNTAIN.\r\n\r\nThis mountain of Iceland, distant about three miles from the village of\r\nKrisuvik, presents a phenomenon very different from the one which has\r\njust been described, _viz._, that of a CALDRON OF BOILING MUD. We\r\nextract the following particulars of this singular curiosity from the\r\nrelation given by Sir G. S. Mackenzie in his travels in Iceland.\r\n\r\nAt the foot of the mountain is a small bank, composed chiefly of white\r\nclay and sulphur, from every part of which steam issues. Having ascended\r\nthis bank, a ridge presents itself, immediately beneath which is a deep\r\nhollow, whence a profusion of vapor arises, with a confused noise of\r\nboiling and splashing, accompanied by steam escaping from narrow\r\ncrevices in the rock. This hollow, as well as the whole side of the\r\nmountain opposite, being covered with sulphur and clay, it was very\r\nhazardous to walk over a soft and steaming surface of such a\r\ndescription. The vapor concealing the party from each other occasioned\r\nmuch uneasiness; and there was some hazard of the crust of sulphur\r\nbreaking, or of the clay sinking beneath their feet. They were thus\r\nseveral times in danger of being scalded, as indeed, happened to one of\r\nthe party, Mr. Bright, who accidentally plunged one of his legs into the\r\nhot clay. When the thermometer was immersed in it, to the depth of a few\r\ninches, it generally rose to within a few degrees of the boiling point.\r\nBy stepping cautiously, and avoiding every little hole from which steam\r\nissued, they soon ascertained how far they might venture. Their good\r\nfortune, however, Sir George observes, ought not to tempt any person to\r\nexamine this wonderful place, without being provided with two boards,\r\nwith which every part of the banks may be traversed in perfect safety.\r\nAt the bottom of the hollow, above described, they found the caldron of\r\nmud, which boiled with the utmost vehemence. They approached within a\r\nfew yards of it, the wind favoring them in viewing every part of this\r\nsingular scene. The mud was in constant agitation, and often thrown up\r\nto the hight of six or eight feet. Near this spot was an irregular space\r\nfilled with water, boiling briskly. At the foot of the hill, in a hollow\r\nformed by a bank of clay and sulphur, steam rushed with great force and\r\nnoise from among the loose fragments of rock.\r\n\r\nIn ascending the mountain, our travelers met with a spring of cold\r\nwater, which was little to be expected in such a place. At a greater\r\nelevation, they came to a ridge, composed entirely of sulphur and clay,\r\njoining two summits of the mountain. The smooth crust of sulphur was\r\nbeautifully crystallized; and beneath it was a quantity of loose\r\ngranular sulphur, which appeared to be collecting and crystallizing, as\r\nit was sublimed along with the steam. On removing the sulphurous crust,\r\nsteam issued, and annoyed the party so much, that they could not examine\r\nthis place to any depth.\r\n\r\nBeneath the ridge, on the farther side of this great bed of sulphur, an\r\nabundance of vapor escaped with a loud noise. Having crossed to the side\r\nof the mountain opposite, they walked to what is called the principal\r\nspring. This was a task of much apparent danger, as the side of the\r\nmountain to the extent of about half a mile, was covered with loose\r\nclay, into which the feet of our travelers sunk at every step. In many\r\nplaces there was a thin crust, beneath which the clay was wet, and\r\nextremely hot. Good fortune attended them; and without any serious\r\ninconvenience, they reached the object they had in view. A dense column\r\nof steam, mixed with a small portion of water, forced its way\r\nimpetuously through a crevice in a rock, at the head of a narrow valley,\r\nor break in the mountain. The violence with which it rushed out was so\r\ngreat, that the noise, thus occasioned, might often be heard at the\r\ndistance of several miles. During the night while the party lay in their\r\ntent at Krisuvik, they more than once listened to it with mingled awe\r\nand astonishment. Behind the column of vapor was a dark-colored rock,\r\nwhich added to the sublimity of the effect.\r\n\r\n“It is quite beyond my power,” observes Sir George Mackenzie, “to offer\r\nsuch a description of this extraordinary place, as would convey adequate\r\nideas of its wonders, or of its terrors. The sensations of a person,\r\neven of firm nerves, standing on a support which feebly sustains him,\r\nover an abyss where, literally, fire and brimstone are in dreadful and\r\nincessant action; having before his eyes tremendous proofs of what is\r\ngoing on beneath him; enveloped in thick vapors; his ears stunned with\r\nthundering noises—must be experienced before they can be understood.”\r\n\r\n                              MONT BLANC.\r\n\r\n                          [See cut, page 38.]\r\n\r\n         “When mid the lifeless summits proud\r\n     Of Alpine cliffs, where to the gelid sky\r\n     Snows piled on snows in wint’ry torpor lie,\r\n     The rays divine of vernal Phœbus play;\r\n     Th’ awakened heaps, in streamlets from on high,\r\n     Roused into action, lively leap away,\r\n   Glad warbling through the vales, in their new being gay.”—THOMSON.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MONT BLANC AND THE GLACIERS.]\r\n\r\nThis mountain, in Switzerland, so named on account of its white aspect,\r\nbelongs to the great central chain of the Alps. It is truly gigantic,\r\nand is the most elevated mountain in Europe, rising no less than fifteen\r\nthousand, eight hundred and seventy-two feet, somewhat more than three\r\nmiles, above the level of the sea, and fourteen thousand, six hundred\r\nand twenty-four feet above the lake of Geneva, in its vicinity. It is\r\nencompassed by those wonderful collections of snow and ice, called\r\nglaciers, two of the principal of which, are called Mont Dolent and\r\nTriolet. The highest part of Mont Blanc, named the Dromedary, is in the\r\nshape of a compressed hemisphere. From that point it sinks gradually,\r\nand presents a kind of concave surface of snow, in the midst of which is\r\na small pyramid of ice. It then rises into a second hemisphere, which is\r\nnamed the Middle Dome; and thence descends into another concave surface,\r\nterminating in a point, which among other names bestowed on it by the\r\nSavoyards, is styled “Dome de Goute,” and may be regarded as the\r\ninferior dome.\r\n\r\nThe first successful attempt to reach the summit of Mont Blanc was made\r\nin August, 1786, by Doctor Paccard, a physician of Chamouny. He was led\r\nto make the attempt by a guide, named Balma, who, in searching for\r\ncrystals, had discovered the only practicable route by which so arduous\r\nan undertaking could be accomplished. The ascent occupied fifteen hours,\r\nand the descent five, under circumstances of the greatest difficulty;\r\nthe sight of the doctor, and that of his guide, Balma, being so affected\r\nby the snow and wind, as to render them almost blind, at the same time\r\nthat the face of each was excoriated, and the lips exceedingly swelled.\r\n\r\nOn the first of August of the following year, 1787, the celebrated and\r\nindefatigable naturalist, M. de Saussure, set out on his successful\r\nexpedition, accompanied by a servant and eighteen guides, who carried a\r\ntent and mattresses, together with the necessary accommodations and\r\nvarious instruments of experimental philosophy. The first night they\r\npassed under the tent, on the summit of the mountain of La Cote, four\r\nthousand, nine hundred and eight-six feet above the Priory, a large\r\nvillage in the vale of Chamouny, the journey thither being exempt from\r\ntrouble or danger, as the ascent is always over turf, or on the solid\r\nrock; though above this place it is wholly over ice or snows.\r\n\r\nEarly next morning they traversed the glacier of La Cote, to gain the\r\nfoot of a small chain of rocks, inclosed in the snows of Mont Blanc. The\r\nglacier is both difficult and dangerous, being intersected by wide,\r\ndeep, irregular chasms, which frequently can be passed only by three\r\nbridges of snow, which are suspended over the abyss. After reaching the\r\nridge of rocks, the track winds along a hollow, or valley, filled with\r\nsnow, which extends north and south to the foot of the highest summit,\r\nand is divided at intervals by enormous crevices. These show the snow to\r\nbe disposed in horizontal beds, each of which answers to a year, and\r\nnotwithstanding the width of the fissures, the depth can in no part be\r\nmeasured. At four in the afternoon, the party reached the second of the\r\nthree great platforms of snow they had to traverse, and here they\r\nencamped, at the hight of nine thousand, three hundred and twelve feet\r\nabove the Priory, or twelve thousand, seven hundred and sixty-eight feet\r\n(nearly two miles and a half) above the level of the sea.\r\n\r\nFrom the center of this platform, inclosed between the farthest summit\r\nof Mont Blanc on the south, its high steps, or terraces, on the east,\r\nand the Dome de Goute on the west, nothing but snow appears. It is quite\r\npure, of a dazzling whiteness, and on the high summits presents a\r\nsingular contrast with the sky, which in these elevated regions is\r\nalmost black. Here no living being is to be seen; no appearance of\r\nvegetation: it is the abode of cold and silence. “When,” observes M. de\r\nSaussure, “I represent to myself Dr. Paccard and James Balma first\r\narriving, on the decline of day, in these deserts, without shelter,\r\nwithout assistance, and even without the certainty that men could live\r\nin the places which they proposed to reach, and still pursuing their\r\ncareer with unshaken intrepidity, it seems impossible to admire too much\r\ntheir strength of mind and their courage.”\r\n\r\nThe company departed, at seven the next morning, to traverse the third\r\nand last platform, the slope of which is extremely steep, being in some\r\nplaces thirty-nine degrees. It terminates in precipices on all sides;\r\nand the surface of the snow was so hard, that those who went foremost\r\nwere obliged to cut places for the feet with hatchets. The last slope of\r\nall presents no danger; but the air possesses so high a degree of\r\nrarity, that the strength is speedily exhausted, and on approaching the\r\nsummit it was found necessary to stop at every fifteen or sixteen paces\r\nto take breath. At eleven they reached the top of the mountain, where\r\nthey continued four hours and a half, during which time M. de Saussure\r\nenjoyed, with rapture and astonishment, a view the most extensive as\r\nwell as the most rugged and sublime in nature, and made those\r\nobservations which have rendered this expedition important to\r\nphilosophy.\r\n\r\nA light vapor, suspended in the lower regions of the air, concealed from\r\nthe sight the lowest and most remote objects, such as the plains of\r\nFrance and Lombardy; but the whole surrounding assemblage of high\r\nsummits appeared with the greatest distinctness.\r\n\r\nM. de Saussure descended with his party, and the next morning reached\r\nChamouny, without the smallest accident. As they had taken the\r\nprecaution to wear vails of crape, their faces were not excoriated, nor\r\ntheir sight debilitated. The cold was not found to be so extremely\r\npiercing as it was described by Dr. Paccard. By experiments made with\r\nthe hygrometer, on the summit of the mountain, the air was found to\r\ncontain a sixth portion only of the humidity of that of Geneva; and to\r\nthis dryness of the air, M. de Saussure imputes the burning thirst which\r\nhe and his companions experienced. The balls of the electrometer\r\ndiverged three lines only, and the electricity was positive. At times\r\nthe air seems filled with electricity. A recent traveler (1854) says,\r\nthat, in the night, his guide having come out from the cabin of the\r\nGrand Mulets, saw the ridges of the mountain apparently all on fire. He\r\nimmediately communicated what he had observed to his companions, who all\r\nrushed to assure themselves of the fact, and then they saw that through\r\nthe electricity generated by the tempest, all the rocks of the Grand\r\nMulets were illuminated. They found the same phenomenon on their own\r\npersons. When they raised their arms, their fingers became\r\nphosphorescent. M. de Saussure found it required half an hour to make\r\nwater boil, while at Geneva fifteen or sixteen minutes sufficed, and\r\ntwelve or thirteen at the seaside. None of his party discovered the\r\nsmallest difference in the taste or smell of bread, wine, meat, fruits\r\nor liquors, as some travelers have pretended is the case at great\r\nhights; but sounds were of course much weakened, from the want of\r\nobjects of reflection. Of all the organs, that of respiration was most\r\naffected, the pulse of one of the guides beating ninety-eight times in a\r\nminute, that of the servant one hundred and twelve, and that of M. de\r\nSaussure one hundred and one; while at Chamouny, the pulsations\r\nrespectively were forty-nine, sixty, and seventy-two. A few days\r\nafterward, Mr. Beaufoy, an English gentleman, succeeded in a similar\r\nattempt, although it was attended with greater difficulty, arising from\r\nenlargements in the chasms in the ice.\r\n\r\nA late traveler, wandering amid the same sublime scenery that has been\r\ndescribed, says:\r\n\r\n“Mont Blanc is clearly visible from Geneva, perhaps once in the week, or\r\nabout sixty times in the year. When he is visible, a walk to the\r\njunction of the Arve and the Rhone, either by the way of the plains on\r\nthe Genevan side, or by the hights on the side toward the south of\r\nFrance, affords a wonderful combination of sublimity and beauty on the\r\nearth and in the heavens. Those snowy mountain ranges, so white, so\r\npure, so dazzling in the clear azure depths, do really look as if they\r\nbelonged to another world; as if, like the faces of supernatural\r\nintelligences, they were looking sadly and steadfastly on our world, to\r\nspeak to us of theirs. Some of these mountain peaks of snow you can see\r\nonly through the perspective of other mountains, nearer to you, and\r\ncovered with verdure, which makes the snowy pyramids appear so distant,\r\nso sharply defined, so high up, so glorious; it is indeed like the voice\r\nof great truths stirring the soul. As your eye follows the range, they\r\nlie in such glittering masses against the horizon, in such grand repose;\r\nthey shoot into the sky in bright weather in such infinite clearness, so\r\npure, so flashing; that they seem never to lose the charm of a sudden\r\nand startling revelation to the mind. Are they not sublime images of the\r\ngreat truths of God’s own word, that sometimes indeed are vailed with\r\nclouds, but in fair weather do carry us, as in a chariot of fire and\r\nwith horses of fire, into eternity, into the presence of God? The\r\natmosphere of our hearts is so misty and stormy, that we do not see them\r\nmore than sixty times a year in their glory: if every Sabbath-day we get\r\na view of them without clouds, we do well; but _when_ we see them as\r\nthey are, then we feel their power, then we are rapt by them from earth,\r\naway, away, away, into the depths of heaven!\r\n\r\n“In some circumstances, when we are climbing the mountains, even the\r\nmists that hang around them do add to the glory of the view; as in the\r\nrising sun, when they are so penetrated with brightness, that they\r\nsoftly rise over the crags as a robe of misty light, or seem like the\r\nmotion of sweet Nature breathing into the atmosphere from her morning\r\naltars the incense of praise. And in the setting sun how often do they\r\nhang around the precipices, glowing with the golden and crimson hues of\r\nthe west, and preventing us from clearly defining the forms of the\r\nmountains, only to make them more lovely to our view. So it is sometimes\r\nwith the very clouds around God’s word, and the lights and shades upon\r\nit. There is an inscrutability of truth which sometimes increases its\r\npower, while we wait with solemn reverence for the hour when it shall be\r\nfully revealed to us; and our faith, like the setting sun, may clothe\r\ncelestial mysteries with a soft and rosy-colored light, which makes them\r\nmore suitable to our present existence, than if we saw them in the clear\r\nand cloudless atmosphere of a spiritual noon.\r\n\r\n“You have a fine point for viewing Mont Blanc, without going out of the\r\ncity, from the ramparts on the west side of Rousseau’s island. Here a\r\nbrazen indicator is erected, with the names of the different mountain\r\nsummits and ridges, so that by taking sight across the index, you can\r\ndistinguish them at once. You will not mistake Mont Blanc, if you see\r\nhim; but until you get accustomed to the panorama, you may easily\r\nmistake one of his court for the king, when the monarch himself is not\r\nvisible.\r\n\r\n“A still better point of view you will have at Coppet, ascending toward\r\nthe Jura. In proportion as you rise from the borders of the lake, every\r\npart of the landscape becomes more beautiful, though what you wish to\r\ngain is the most commanding view of the mountains, every other object\r\nbeing secondary. In a bright day, nothing can be more clearly and\r\ndistinctly defined than Mont Blanc, with his attendant mighty ranges,\r\ncut in dazzling snowy brightness against the clear blue sky. The sight\r\nof those glorious glittering fields and mountains of ice and snow,\r\nproduces immediately a longing to be there among them. They make an\r\nimpression upon the soul, of something supernatural, almost divine.\r\nAlthough the whole scene lying before you is so beautiful, (the lake,\r\nthe verdant banks, the trees, and the lower ranges of verdure-covered\r\nmountains, constituting in themselves alone one of the loveliest\r\npictures in the world,) yet the snowy ranges of Mont Blanc are the grand\r\nfeature. Those glittering distant peaks are the only thing in the scene\r\nthat takes a powerful hold upon the soul; but they do quite possess it,\r\nand tyrannize over it, with an ecstatic thralldom. One is never wearied\r\nwith gazing and wondering at the glory. I will lift up mine eyes unto\r\nthe hills, from whence cometh my help!\r\n\r\n“Another admirable point, much farther from the lake and the city than\r\nthe preceding, and at a greater elevation, is what is called the\r\npromenade of the point Sacconex. A fine engraving of this view is\r\nprinted on letter-paper for correspondence; but there is not sufficient\r\ndistinctness given to the outlines of Mont Blanc and the other summits\r\nof the glittering snowy range, that seems to float in the heavens like\r\nthe far-off alabaster walls of Paradise. No language, nor any engraving,\r\ncan convey the ravishing magnificence and splendor, the exciting\r\nsublimity and beauty of the scene. But there are days in which the air\r\naround the mountains seems itself of such a hazy whiteness, that the\r\nsnow melts into the atmosphere as it were, and dies away in the heavens\r\nlike the indistinct outline of a bright but partially remembered dream.\r\nThere are other days in which the fleecy clouds, like vails of light\r\nover the faces of angels, do so rest upon and mingle with the snowy\r\nsummits, that you can hardly tell where one begins and the other ends.\r\nSometimes you look upon the clouds thinking they are mountains, and then\r\nagain Mont Blanc himself will be revealed in such far-off, unmoving,\r\nglittering grandeur, in such wonderful distinctness, that there is no\r\nmistaking the changeful imitations of his glory for the reality.\r\nSometimes the clouds and the mountains together are mingled in such a\r\nmultitudinous and interminable array of radiances, that it seems like\r\nthe white-robed armies of heaven with their floating banners, marching\r\nand countermarching in front of the domes and jeweled battlements of the\r\ncelestial city. When the fog scenery (of which I shall give you a\r\ndescription) takes place upon the earth, and at the same time there are\r\nsuch revelations of the snowy summits in the heavens, and such goings on\r\nof glory among them, and you get upon the mountain to see them, it is\r\nimpossible to describe the effect, as of a vast enchantment, upon the\r\nmind.\r\n\r\n“The view of Geneva, the lake, and the Jura mountains from Coligny is\r\nmuch admired; and at sunset, perhaps the world can not offer a more\r\nlovely scene. It was here that Byron took up his abode; a choice which I\r\nhave wondered at, for you can not see Mont Blanc from this point, and\r\ntherefore the situation is inferior to many others. Ascending the hill\r\nfarther to the east, when you come to Col. Tronchin’s beautiful\r\nresidence, you have perhaps the finest of all the views of Mont Blanc,\r\nin or around Geneva. Go upon the top of Col. Tronchin’s tower about half\r\nan hour before sunset, and the scene is not unworthy of comparison even\r\nwith the glory of the sunrise as witnessed from the summit of the Righi.\r\nIt is surprising to see how long Mont Blanc retains the light of day,\r\nand how long the snow burns in the setting sun, after his orb has sunk\r\nfrom your own view entirely behind the green range of the Jura. Then\r\nafter a succession of tints from the crimson to the cold gray, it being\r\nmanifest that the sun has left the mountain to a companionship with the\r\nstars alone, you also are ready to depart, the glory of the scene being\r\nover, when suddenly and unaccountably the snowy summits redden again, as\r\nif the sun were returning upon them, the countenance of Mont Blanc is\r\nfilled with rosy light, and the cold gray gives place for a few moments\r\nto a deep warm radiant pink, (as if you saw a sudden smile playing over\r\nthe features of a sleeping angel,) which at length again dies in the\r\ntwilight. This phenomenon is extremely beautiful, but I know not how to\r\naccount for it; nor was any one of our party wiser than I; nevertheless,\r\nour ignorance of causes need never diminish, but often increases the\r\npleasure of beautiful sights.”\r\n\r\n“I have said I would give you a description of the ‘fog-scenery.’ In the\r\nautumn, when the fogs prevail, it is often a thick drizzling mist in\r\nGeneva, and nothing visible, while on the mountain tops the air is pure,\r\nand the sun shining. On such a day as this, when the children of the\r\nmist tell you that on the mountains it is fair weather, you must start\r\nearly for the range nearest Geneva, on the way to Chamouny, the range of\r\nthe Grand Saléve, the base of which is about four miles distant,\r\nprepared to spend the day upon the mountains, and you will witness one\r\nof the most singular and beautiful scenes to be enjoyed in Switzerland.\r\n\r\n“The day I set out was so misty, that I took an umbrella, for the fog\r\ngathered and fell like rain, and I more than doubted whether I should\r\nsee the sun at all. In the midst of this mist I climbed the rocky zigzag\r\nhalf hewn out of the face of the mountain, and half natural, and passing\r\nthe village that is perched among the high rocks, which might be a\r\nrefuge for the conies, began toiling up the last ascent of the mountain,\r\nseeing nothing, feeling nothing, but the thick mist, the vail of which\r\nhad closed below and behind me over village, path and precipice, and\r\nstill continued heavy and dark above me, so that I thought I never\r\nshould get out of it. Suddenly my head rose above the level of the fog\r\ninto the clear air, and the heavens were shining, and Mont Blanc, with\r\nthe whole illimitable range of snowy mountain tops around him, was\r\nthrowing back the sun! An ocean of mist, as smooth as a chalcedony, as\r\nsoft and white as the down of the eider-duck’s breast, lay over the\r\nwhole lower world; and as I rose above it, and ascended the mountain to\r\nits overhanging verge, it seemed an infinite abyss of vapor, where only\r\nthe mountain tops were visible, on the Jura range like verdant wooded\r\nislands, on the Mont Blanc range as glittering surges and pyramids of\r\nice and snow. No language can describe the extraordinary sublimity and\r\nbeauty of the view. A level sea of white mist in every direction, as far\r\nas the eye could extend, with a continent of mighty icebergs on the one\r\nside floating in it, and on the other a forest promontory, with a slight\r\nundulating swell in the bosom of the sea, like the long, smooth\r\nundulations of the ocean in a calm.\r\n\r\n“Standing on the overhanging crags, I could hear the chime of bells, the\r\nhum of busy labor, and the lowing of cattle, buried in the mist, and\r\nfaintly coming up to you from the fields and villages. Now and then a\r\nbird darted up out of the mist into the clear sun and air, and sailed in\r\nplayful circles, and then dived and disappeared again below the surface.\r\nBy and by the wind began to agitate the cloudy sea, and more and more of\r\nthe mountains became visible. Sometimes you have a bright sunset athwart\r\nthis sea of cloud, which then rolls in waves burnished and tipped with\r\nfire. When you go down into the mist again, and leave behind you the\r\nbeautiful sky, a clear, bracing atmosphere, the bright sun and the\r\nsnow-shining mountains, it is like passing from heaven to earth, from\r\nthe brightness and serenity of the one, to the darkness and cares of the\r\nother. The whole scene is a leaf in nature’s book, which but few turn\r\nover; but how rich it is in beauty and glory, and in food for\r\nmeditation, none can tell but those who have witnessed it. This is a\r\nscene in Cloud-land, which hath its mysteries of beauty, that defy the\r\nskill of the painter and engraver.\r\n\r\n“The poet Wordsworth has given two very vivid descriptions of these mist\r\nphenomena, under different aspects from that in which I witnessed them.\r\nThe first is contained in his descriptive sketches of a pedestrian tour\r\namong the Alps.\r\n\r\n           “‘’Tis morn: with gold the verdant mountain glows,\r\n           More high, the snowy peaks with hues of rose.\r\n           Far stretched beneath the many-tinted hills\r\n           A mighty waste of mist the valley fills,\r\n           A solemn sea! whose vales and mountains round\r\n           Stand motionless, to awful silence bound.\r\n           A gulf of gloomy blue, that opens wide\r\n           And bottomless, divides the midway tide.\r\n           Like leaning masts of stranded ships appear\r\n           The pines, that near the coast their summits rear.\r\n           Of cabins, woods and lawns a pleasant shore\r\n           Bounds calm and clear the chaos still and hoar.\r\n           Loud through that midway gulf ascending, sound,\r\n           Unnumbered streams with hollow roar profound.\r\n           Mount through the nearer mist the chant of birds,\r\n           And talking voices, and the low of herds,\r\n           The bark of dogs, the drowsy tinkling bell,\r\n           And wild-wood mountain lutes of saddest swell.’\r\n\r\n“But this extract is not to be compared for power to the following from\r\nthe same poem, describing an Alpine sunset after a day of mist and storm\r\nupon the mountains.\r\n\r\n          “‘’Tis storm, and hid in mist from hour to hour,\r\n          All day the floods a deepening murmur pour.\r\n          The sky is vailed, and every cheerful sight,\r\n          Dark is the region as with coming night,\r\n          But what a sudden burst of overpowering light\r\n          Triumphant on the bosom of the storm\r\n          Glances the fire-clad eagle’s wheeling form.\r\n          Eastward, in long perspective glittering, shine\r\n          The wood-crowned cliffs, that o’er the lake recline.\r\n          Wide o’er the Alps a hundred streams unfold,\r\n          At once to pillars turned, that flame with gold.\r\n          Behind his sail the peasant tries to shun\r\n          The west, that burns like one dilated sun,\r\n          Where in a mighty crucible expire\r\n          The mountains, glowing hot, like coals of fire!’\r\n\r\n“There was a time during the middle ages, when Chamouny was inhabited by\r\nmonks. The reigning lord of the country made a present of the whole\r\nvalley to a convent of Benedictine friars, in the eleventh century. Two\r\nEnglish travelers, Messrs. Pococke and Windham, drew attention to its\r\nwonderful scenery in 1741, and now it is a grand highway of summer\r\ntravel, visited annually by three or four thousand people. A visit to\r\nMont Blanc has become a pilgrimage of fashion. Fashion does some good\r\nthings in her day; and it is a great thing to have the steps of men\r\ndirected into this grand temple of nature, who would otherwise be\r\ndawdling the summer perhaps at immoral watering-places. A man can hardly\r\npass through the vale of Chamouny, before the awful face of Mont Blanc,\r\nand not feel that he is an immortal being. The great mountain looks with\r\nan eye, and speaks with a voice, that does something to wake the soul\r\nout of its slumbers.\r\n\r\n“The sublime hymn by Coleridge, in the vale before sunrise, is the\r\nconcentrated expression of all the inspiring and heaven-directing\r\ninfluences of the scenery. The poem is as remarkably distinguished above\r\nthe whole range of poetry in our language, for its sublimity, as the\r\nmountain itself among all the great ranges of the Alps. I am determined\r\nto quote it in full, for that and the tour of Mont Blanc ought to go\r\ntogether; and I will present along with it the German original of the\r\npoem in twenty lines, nearly as translated by Coleridge’s admiring and\r\naffectionate relative. I am not aware that Coleridge himself ever\r\nvisited the vale of Chamouny; and if not, then that wonderful hymn to\r\nMont Blanc was the work of imagination solely, building on the basis of\r\nthe original lines in German. This was a grand and noble foundation, it\r\nis true; but the hymn by Coleridge was a perfect transfiguration of the\r\npiece, an inspiration of it with a higher soul, and an investiture of it\r\nwith garments that shine like the sun. It was the greatest work of the\r\npoet’s great and powerful imagination, combined with the deep worshiping\r\nsense of spiritual things in his soul.\r\n\r\n“On visiting the scene, one is apt to feel as if he could not have\r\nwritten it in the vale itself: the details of the picture would have\r\nbeen somewhat different; and, confined by the reality, one may doubt if\r\neven Coleridge’s genius could have gained that lofty ideal point of\r\nobservation and conception, from which he drew the vast and glorious\r\nimagery that rose before him. Not because the poem is more glorious than\r\nthe reality, for that is impossible; but because, in painting _from_ the\r\nreality, the force and sublimity of his general conceptions would have\r\nbeen weakened by the attempt at faithfulness in the detail, and nothing\r\nlike the impression of the aerial grandeur of the scene, its despotic\r\nunity in the imagination, notwithstanding its variety, would have been\r\nconveyed to the mind.\r\n\r\n“Yet there are parts of it which at sunrise or sunset either, the poet\r\nmight have written from the very windows of his bedroom, if he had been\r\nthere in the dawn and evenings of days of such extraordinary brilliancy\r\nand glory, as marked and filled the atmosphere, during our sojourn in\r\nthat blessed region. A glorious region it is, much nearer heaven than\r\nour common world, and carrying a sensitive, rightly constituted mind far\r\nup in spirit toward the gates of heaven, toward God, whose glory is the\r\nlight of heaven, and of whose power and majesty the mountains,\r\nice-fields and glaciers, whether beneath the sun, moon, or stars, are a\r\ndim, though grand and glittering, symbol. ‘Fire and hail, snow and\r\nvapor, stormy wind, fulfilling His word, mountains and all hills,\r\nfruitful trees and all cedars, praise the Lord. He looketh on the earth\r\nand it trembleth; He toucheth the hills, and they smoke.’\r\n\r\n“The following is the original German hymn, in what the translator\r\ndenominates a very bald English translation, to be compared as a\r\ncuriosity with its glorification in Coleridge. It occupies but five\r\nstanzas of four lines, and is entitled, ‘Chamouny at Sunrise. To\r\nKlopstock.’ I have here put it into the metrical form of the original.\r\n\r\n      “Out of the deep shade of the silent fir-grove,\r\n      Trembling I survey thee, mountain-head of eternity,\r\n      Dazzling (blinding) summit, from whose vast hight\r\n      My dimly perceiving spirit floats into the Everlasting.\r\n\r\n      “Who sank the pillar deep in the lap of earth\r\n      Which, for past centuries, fast props thy mass up?\r\n      Who uptowered, high in the vault of ether,\r\n      Mighty and bold, thy beaming countenance?\r\n\r\n      “Who poured you from on high, out of eternal Winter’s realm,\r\n      O jagged streams, downward with thunder-noise?\r\n      And who bade aloud, with the Almighty Voice,\r\n      ‘Here shall rest the stiffening billows?’\r\n\r\n      “Who marks out there the path for the Morning Star?\r\n      Who wreathes with blossoms the skirt of eternal Frost?\r\n      To whom, wild Arveiron, in terrible harmonies,\r\n      Rolls up the sound of thy tumult of billows?\r\n\r\n      “Jehovah! Jehovah! crashes in the bursting ice!\r\n      Avalanche-thunders roll it in the cleft downward:\r\n      Jehovah! it rustles in the bright tree-tops;\r\n      It whispers murmuring in the purling silver-brooks.\r\n\r\n“This is very grand. Who but a mighty poet, one seeing with ‘the vision\r\nand the faculty divine’—what, but a transfusing, all-conquering\r\nimagination—would have dared the attempt to compose another poem on the\r\nsame subject, or to carry this to a greater hight of sublimity, by\r\nmelting it down anew, so to speak, and pouring it out into a vaster,\r\nmore glorious mold? The more one thinks of it, the more he will see, in\r\nthe poem so produced, a proof most remarkable, of the spontaneous,\r\ndeep-seated, easily exerted, and almost exhaustless power and\r\noriginality of Coleridge’s genius. Now let us peruse, ‘with mute thanks\r\nand secret ecstacy,’ his own solemn and stupendous lines.\r\n\r\n             HYMN BEFORE SUNRISE, IN THE VALE OF CHAMOUNY.\r\n\r\n[Besides the rivers Arve and Arveiron, which have their sources in the\r\nfoot of Mont Blanc, five conspicuous torrents rush down its sides; and,\r\nwithin a few paces of the glaciers, the Gentiana Major grows in immense\r\nnumbers, with its ‘flowers of loveliest blue.’]\r\n\r\n         “Hast thou a charm to stay the Morning Star\r\n         In his steep course? so long he seems to pause\r\n         On thy bald, awful head, O Sovran Blanc?\r\n         The Arve and Arveiron at thy base\r\n         Rave ceaselessly; but thou, most awful form!\r\n         Risest from forth thy silent sea of pines,\r\n         How silently! Around thee and above,\r\n         Deep is the air, and dark, substantial, black;\r\n         An ebon mass: methinks thou piercest it\r\n         As with a wedge! But when I look again,\r\n         It is thine own calm home, thy crystal shrine,\r\n         Thy habitation from Eternity!\r\n\r\n         “O dread and silent Mount! I gazed upon thee,\r\n         Till thou, still present to the bodily sense,\r\n         Didst vanish from my thought: entranced in prayer\r\n         I worshiped the Invisible alone.\r\n\r\n           “Yet, like some sweet, beguiling melody,\r\n         So sweet, we know not we are listening to it,\r\n         Thou, the meanwhile, wast blending with my thought,\r\n         Yea, with my life, and life’s own secret joy,\r\n         Till the dilating Soul, enrapt, transfused,\r\n         Into the mighty vision passing,—there,\r\n         As in her natural form, swelled vast to heaven!\r\n\r\n           “Awake my Soul! not only passive praise\r\n         Thou owest! not alone these swelling tears,\r\n         Mute thanks and secret ecstacy! Awake,\r\n         Voice of sweet song! Awake, my heart, awake!\r\n         Green vales and icy cliffs, all join my hymn.\r\n\r\n           “Thou first and chief, sole sovran of the vale\r\n         Oh, struggling with the darkness all night long,\r\n         And all night visited by troops of stars,\r\n         Or when they climb the sky, or when they sink!\r\n         Companion of the morning star at dawn,\r\n         Thyself earth’s rosy star, and of the dawn\r\n         Coherald: wake, oh wake, and utter praise!\r\n         Who sank thy sunless pillars deep in earth?\r\n         Who filled thy countenance with rosy light?\r\n         Who made thee parent of perpetual streams?\r\n\r\n           “And you, ye five wild torrents, fiercely glad!\r\n         Who called you forth from night and utter death,\r\n         From dark and icy caverns called you forth,\r\n         Down those precipitous, black, jagged rocks,\r\n         Forever shattered, and the same forever?\r\n         Who gave you your invulnerable life,\r\n         Your strength, your speed, your fury and your joy,\r\n         Unceasing thunder and eternal foam?\r\n         And who commanded (and the silence came,)\r\n         Here let the billows stiffen and have rest?\r\n\r\n           “Ye ice-falls! ye that from the mountain’s brow,\r\n         Adown enormous ravines slope amain—\r\n         Torrents, methinks, that heard a mighty voice,\r\n         And stopped at once, amidst their maddest plunge!\r\n         Motionless torrents! silent cataracts!\r\n         Who made you glorious as the gates of heaven\r\n         Beneath the keen full moon? Who bade the sun\r\n         Clothe you with rainbows? Who, with living flowers\r\n         Of loveliest blue, spread garlands at your feet?\r\n         GOD! let the torrents, like a shout of nations,\r\n         Answer! and let the ice-plains echo, GOD!\r\n         GOD! sing, ye meadow-streams, with gladsome voice!\r\n         Ye pine-groves, with your soft and soul-like sounds!\r\n         And they, too, have a voice, yon piles of snow,\r\n         And in their perilous fall shall thunder, GOD!\r\n\r\n           “Ye living flowers, that skirt the eternal frost!\r\n         Ye wild goats sporting round the eagle’s nest!\r\n         Ye eagles, playmates of the mountain-storm!\r\n         Ye lightnings, the dread arrows of the clouds!\r\n         Ye signs and wonders of the elements!\r\n         Utter forth GOD! and fill the hills with praise!\r\n\r\n           “Thou, too, hoar Mount, with thy sky-pointing peaks,\r\n         Oft from whose feet, the avalanche, unheard,\r\n         Shoots downward, glittering through the pure serene\r\n         Into the depths of clouds, that vail thy breast;\r\n         Thou too again, stupendous mountain! thou,\r\n         That as I raise my head, awhile bowed low\r\n         In adoration, upward from thy base\r\n         Slow traveling with dim eyes suffused with tears,\r\n         Solemnly seemest, like a vapory cloud,\r\n         To rise before me,—Rise, oh ever rise!\r\n         Rise, like a cloud of incense, from the earth!\r\n         Thou kingly spirit throned among the hills,\r\n         Thou dread embassador from Earth to Heaven,\r\n         Great Hierarch! tell thou the silent sky,\r\n         And tell the stars, and tell yon rising sun,\r\n         Earth, with her thousand voices, praises God!\r\n\r\n“Thanks to thee, thou noble poet, for giving this glorious voice to\r\nAlpine nature, for so befitting and not unworthy an interpretation of\r\nNature’s own voice, in words of our own mother-tongue. Thanks to God for\r\nhis grace vouchsafed to thee, so that now thou praisest Him amidst the\r\ninfinite host of flaming seraphs, before the mount supreme of glory,\r\nwhere all the empyrean rings with angelic hallelujahs! The creation of\r\nsuch a mind as Coleridge’s, is only outdone by its redemption through\r\nthe blood of the Lamb. Oh, who can tell the rapture of a soul, that\r\ncould give a voice for nations to such a mighty burst of praise to God\r\nin this world, when its powers, uplifted in eternity, and dilated with\r\nabsorbing, unmingled, unutterable love, shall pour themselves forth in\r\nthe anthem of redemption, Worthy is the Lamb that was slain!”\r\n\r\n\r\n                      THE GLACIERS, OR ICE MASSES.\r\n\r\nThe three great glaciers, or ice-mountains, which descend from the\r\nflanks of Mont Blanc, add their ice to that of the Miage, and present a\r\nmajestic spectacle, amid the astonishing succession of icy summits, of\r\ndeep valleys, and of wide chasms, which have become channels for the\r\ninnumerable torrents and cataracts with which these mountains abound.\r\nThe view which the glacier of Talafre affords from its center, looking\r\ntoward the north, is as extraordinary as beautiful. It rises gradually\r\nto the base of a semicircular girdle, formed of peaks of granite of a\r\ngreat hight, and terminating in sharp summits, extremely varied in their\r\nforms; while the intervals between these peaks are filled up by ice,\r\nwhich falls into this mass, and this mass of ice is crowned by masses of\r\nsnow, rising in festoons between the black and vertical tables of\r\ngranite, the steepness of which does not allow them to remain. A ridge\r\nof shattered wrecks divides this glacier lengthwise, and forms its most\r\nelevated part, being eight thousand, five hundred and thirty-eight feet,\r\nor upward of a mile and a half above the level of the sea. This prospect\r\nhas nothing in common with what is seen in other parts of the world. The\r\nimmense masses of ice, surrounded and surmounted by pyramidal rocks,\r\nstill more enormous in magnitude; the contrast between the whiteness of\r\nthe snow and the obscure colors of the stones, moistened by the water\r\nwhich trickles down their sides; the purity of the air; the dazzling\r\nlight of the sun, which gives to these objects extraordinary brilliancy;\r\nthe majestic and awful silence which reigns in these vast solitudes, a\r\nsilence which is only interrupted at intervals by the noise of some\r\ngreat mass of granite, or of ice, tumbling from the top of the mountain;\r\nand the nakedness of these elevated rocks themselves, on which neither\r\nanimals, shrubs, nor verdure are to be seen, combined with the\r\nrecollection of the fertile country and rich vegetation which the\r\nadjacent valleys at so small a distance present; all tend to produce a\r\nmixed impression of admiration and terror, which tempts the spectator to\r\nbelieve, that he has been suddenly transported into a world forgotten by\r\nthe great Author of nature. One of these glaciers, that of Triolet, is\r\ncovered with the wrecks of another ice-mountain, which fell some years\r\nago, and buried many huts, flocks, and shepherds beneath its ruins.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           THE MER DE GLACE.\r\n\r\nThese glaciers have their foundation in the wonderful =Mer de Glace=, or\r\n=Sea of Ice=; shooting up from it their sharp peaks into the frozen air.\r\n“To get the best view of it as a whole,” says a modern Alpine tourist,\r\n“you cross the meadows in the vale of Chamouny, step over the furious\r\nArve, and climb the mountain precipices to the hight of two thousand\r\nfeet, by a rough, craggy path, sometimes winding amidst a wood of firs,\r\nand sometimes wandering over green grasses. At Montanvert you find\r\nyourself on the extremity of a plateau, so situated, that on one side\r\nyou may look down into the dread frozen sea, and on the other, by a few\r\nsteps, into the lovely green vale of Chamouny! What astonishing variety\r\nand contrast in the spectacle! Far beneath, a smiling and verdant\r\nvalley, watered by the Arve, with hamlets, fields and gardens, the abode\r\nof life, sweet children and flowers; far above, savage and inaccessible\r\ncrags of ice and granite, and a cataract of stiffened billows,\r\nstretching away beyond sight—the throne of death and winter.\r\n\r\n“From the bosom of the tumbling sea of ice, huge granite needles shoot\r\ninto the sky, objects of singular sublimity, one of them rising to the\r\ngreat hight of thirteen thousand feet, seven thousand above the point\r\nwhere you are standing. This is more than double the hight of Mount\r\nWashington in our country, and this amazing pinnacle of rock looks like\r\nthe spire of an interminable colossal cathedral, with other pinnacles\r\naround it. No snow can cling to the summits of these jagged spires; the\r\nlightning does not splinter them; the tempests rave round them; and at\r\ntheir base, those eternal drifting ranges of snow are formed, that sweep\r\ndown into the frozen sea, and feed the perpetual, immeasurable masses of\r\nthe glacier. Meanwhile, the laughing verdure, sprinkled with flowers,\r\nplays upon the edges of the enormous masses of ice, so near, that you\r\nmay almost touch the ice with one hand, and with the other pluck the\r\nviolet. So, oftentimes, the ice and the verdure are mingled in our\r\nearthly pilgrimage; so, sometimes, in one and the same family, you may\r\nsee the exquisite refinements and the coarse repugnancies of human\r\nnature. So, in the same house of God, on the same bench, may sit an\r\nangel and a murderer; a villain, like a glacier, and a man with a heart\r\nlike a sweet running brook in the sunshine.\r\n\r\n“The impetuous arrested cataract seems as if it were plowing the rocky\r\ngorge with its turbulent surges. Indeed, the ridges of rocky fragments\r\nalong the edges of the glacier, called _moraines_, do look precisely as\r\nif a colossal iron plow had torn them from the mountain, and laid them\r\nalong in one continuous furrow on the frozen verge. It is a scene of\r\nstupendous sublimity. These mighty granite peaks, hewn and pinnacled\r\ninto Gothic towers, and these rugged mountain-walls and buttresses—what\r\na cathedral! with this cloudless sky, by starlight, for its fretted\r\nroof; the chanting wail of the tempest, and the rushing of the avalanche\r\nfor its organ. How grand the thundering sound of the vast masses of ice\r\ntumbling from the roof of the Arve-cavern at the foot of the glacier!\r\nDoes it not seem, as it sullenly and heavily echoes, and rolls up from\r\nso immense a distance below, even more sublime than the thunder of the\r\navalanche above us? We could tell better if we could have a genuine\r\nupper avalanche to compare with it. But what a stupendous scene! ‘I\r\nbegin now,’ said my companion, ‘to understand the origin of the Gothic\r\narchitecture.’ This was a very natural feeling; but, after all, it could\r\nnot have been such a scene, that gave birth to the great idea of that\r\n‘frozen poetry’ of the middle ages. Far more likely it was the sounding\r\naisles of the dim woods, with their checkered green light, and\r\nfestooned, pointing arches.\r\n\r\n“The colossal furrows of rocks and gravel along the edges of the ice at\r\nthe shores of the sea, are produced by the action of the frost and the\r\navalanches, with the march of the glacier against the sides of the\r\nmountains. Nothing can be more singular than these ridges of mountain\r\n=debris=, apparently plowed up and worked off by the moving of the whole\r\nbed of ice down the valley. Near the shore, the sea is turbid with these\r\nrocks and gravel; but as you go out into the channel, the ice becomes\r\nclearer and more glittering, the crevices and fissures deeper and more\r\ndangerous, and all the phenomena more astonishing. Deep, blue, pellucid\r\nfounts of ice-cold water lie in the opening gulfs; and sometimes,\r\nputting your ear to the yawning fissures, you may hear the rippling of\r\nthe rills below, that from the bosom of the glacier are hurrying down to\r\nconstitute the Arve, bursting furiously forth from the great ice-cavern\r\nin the valley.\r\n\r\n“This Mer de Glace is an easy and excellent residence for the scientific\r\nstudy of the glaciers, a subject of very great interest, formerly filled\r\nwith mysteries, which the bold and persevering investigations and\r\ntheories of some modern naturalists have quite cleared up. The strange\r\nmovements of the glaciers, their apparent willful rejection of\r\nextraneous bodies and substances to the surface and the margin, their\r\nincrease and decrease, long remained invested with something of the\r\nsupernatural: they seemed to have a soul and a life of their own. They\r\nlook motionless and silent, yet they are always moving and sounding on,\r\nand they have great voices that give prophetic warning of the weather to\r\nthe shepherds of the Alps. Scientific men have set up huts upon the sea,\r\nand landmarks on the mountains opposite, to test the progress of the icy\r\nmasses, and in this way it was found that a cabin constructed by\r\nProfessor Hugi on the glacier of the Aar, had traveled, between the\r\nyears 1827 and 1840, a distance of forty-six hundred feet. It is\r\nsupposed that the Mer de Glace moves down between four and five hundred\r\nfeet annually.\r\n\r\n“It is impossible to form a grander image of the rigidity and\r\nbarrenness, the coldness and death of winter, than when you stand among\r\nthe billows of one of these frozen seas; and yet it is here that Nature\r\nlocks up in her careful bosom the treasures of the Alpine valleys, the\r\nsources of rich summer verdure and vegetable life. They are hoarded up\r\nin winter, to be poured forth beneath the sun, and with the sun in\r\nsummer. Some of the largest rivers in Europe take their rise from the\r\nglaciers, and give to the Swiss valleys their most abundant supply of\r\nwater, in the season when ordinary streams are dried up. This is a most\r\ninteresting provision in the economy of nature, for if the glaciers did\r\nnot exist, those verdant valleys into which the summer sun pours with\r\nsuch fervor, would be parched with drought. So the mountains are parents\r\nof perpetual streams, and the glaciers are reservoirs of plenty.\r\n\r\n“The derivation of the German name for glacier, =gletscher=, is\r\nsuggested as coming not from their icy material, but their perpetual\r\nmotion, from =glitschen=, to glide; more probably, however, from the\r\nidea of gliding upon their surface. These glaciers come down from the\r\nair, down out of heaven, a perpetual frozen motion, ever changing and\r\ngliding, from the first fall of snow in the atmosphere, through the\r\nstate of consolidated grinding blocks of ice, and then into musical\r\nstreams that water the valleys. First it is a powdery, feathery snow,\r\nthen granulated like hail, and denominated _firn_, forming vast beds and\r\nsheets around the highest mountain summits, then frozen into masses, by\r\nwhich time it has traveled down to within seven thousand feet above the\r\nlevel of the sea, where commences the great ice-ocean that fills the\r\nuninhabitable Alpine valleys, unceasingly freezing, melting and moving\r\ndown. It has been estimated by Saussure and others, that these seas of\r\nice, at their greatest thickness, are six or eight hundred feet deep.\r\nThey are traversed by deep fissures, and as they approach the great\r\nprecipices, over which they plunge like a cataract into the vales, they\r\nare split in all directions, and heaved up into waves, reefs, peaks,\r\npinnacles and minarets. Underneath they are traversed by as many\r\ngalleries and caverns, through which run the rills and torrents\r\nconstantly gathering from the melting masses above. These innumerable\r\nstreams, gathering in one as they approach the termination of the\r\nglacier, rush out from beneath it, under a great vault of ice, and thus\r\nare born into the breathing world, full-grown roaring rivers, from\r\nnight, frost and chaos.\r\n\r\n“A peasant has been known to have fallen into an ice-gulf in one of\r\nthese seas, near one of the flowing sub-glacial torrents, and following\r\nthe course of the stream to the foot of the glacier, he came out alive!\r\nThe German naturalist, Hugi, set out to explore the recesses of one of\r\nthe glaciers through the bed of a former torrent, and wandered on in its\r\nice-caverns the distance of a mile. ‘The ice was everywhere eaten away\r\ninto dome-shaped hollows, varying from two to twelve feet in hight, so\r\nthat the whole mass of the glacier rested at intervals on pillars, or\r\nfeet of ice, irregular in size and shape, which had been left standing.\r\nAs soon as any of these props gave way, a portion of the glacier would\r\nof course fall in and move on. A dim twilight, scantily transmitted\r\nthrough the mass of ice above, prevailed in these caverns of ice, not\r\nsufficient to allow one to read, except close to the fissures, which\r\ndirectly admitted the daylight. The intense blue of the mass of the ice\r\ncontrasted remarkably with the pure white of the icy stalactites, or\r\npendents descending from the roof. The water streamed down upon him from\r\nall sides, so that, after wandering about for two hours, at times\r\nbending and creeping, to get along under the low vault, he returned to\r\nthe open air, quite drenched and half-frozen.’\r\n\r\n“This sea of ice, which embosoms in its farthest recesses a little\r\nliving flower-garden, whither the humble-bees from Chamouny resort for\r\nhoney, is also bordered by steep lonely beds of the fragrant\r\nrhododendron, or rose of the Alps. This hardy and beautiful flower grows\r\nfrom a bush larger than our sweet-fern, with foliage like the leaves of\r\nthe ivory-plum. It continues blooming late in the season, and sometimes\r\ncovers vast declivities on the mountains at a great hight, where one\r\nwould hardly suppose it possible for a handful of earth to cling to the\r\nrocky surface. There, amid the snows and ice of a thousand winters, it\r\npours forth its perfume on the air, though there be none to inhale the\r\nfragrance, or praise the sweetness, save only ‘the little busy bees,’\r\nthat seem dizzy with delight, as they throw themselves into the bosom of\r\nthese beds of roses.\r\n\r\n“Higher still on the opposite side of this great ice-sea, there are\r\nmountain-slopes of grass at the base of stupendous rocky pinnacles,\r\nwhither the shepherds of the Alps drive their herds from Chamouny, for\r\nthree months’ pasturage. They have no way of getting them there but\r\nacross the dangerous glacier; and it is said that the passage is a sort\r\nof annual celebration, when men, women and children go up to Montanvert,\r\nto witness and assist the difficult transportation. When the herds have\r\ncrossed, one peasant stays with them for the whole three months of their\r\nsummer excursion, living upon bread and cheese, with one cow among the\r\nherd to supply him with milk. When he is not sleeping, he knits\r\nstockings, and ruminates as contentedly as the browsing cattle, his only\r\ncare being to increase his store.”\r\n\r\n                          VIEW FROM THE BUET.\r\n\r\nBefore we take our leave of Mont Blanc and of the Alps, the peculiarly\r\nbrilliant view from the summit of the Buet ought to be noticed. Never,\r\nsays M. Bourrit, did prospect appear so vast. Toward the west, the Rhone\r\nis seen, winding for the space of thirty-six leagues through the rich\r\nplains of the Valais; the parts of the river which the mountains cover\r\nwith their shade seeming like threads of silver, and those which the sun\r\nillumines like threads of gold. Beyond the river and its rich plains,\r\nthe view extends to the highest mountains of Switzerland, St. Gothard,\r\nand the Grisons, all covered with ice; while on the east, the hights\r\nsink suddenly, from some of the loftiest elevations on the globe, to\r\nlevel plains washed by the sea. Geneva seems like a spot at one end of\r\nthe lake, and the lake itself like a sinuous band, dividing the fields\r\nwhich it waters. Beyond it are discovered the vast plains of Franche\r\nComte and Burgundy, the mountains of which diminish by almost\r\nimperceptible gradations. Here the eye has neither power nor extent of\r\nsight to embrace the whole of the objects presented to its view. Amid\r\nthe fearful aspect of the precipices which descend on every side, what a\r\ncontrast between the country decorated with all that is smiling and gay,\r\nand the sublime spectacle of the Alps, their gloomy and aspiring\r\nsummits, and, above all, the prodigious hight of Mont Blanc, that\r\nenormous colossus of snow and ice, which parts the clouds, and pierces\r\nto the very heavens! Below this mountain, which bids defiance to time,\r\nand whose eternal ice disregards the dissolving power of the sun, a band\r\nof pyramidical rocks appear, the intervals between them being so many\r\nvalleys of ice, the immensity of which appalls the imagination. Their\r\ndeep chasms may be distinguished, and the noise of the frequent\r\navalanches (falls of immense masses of snow) presents to the mind the\r\ngloomy ideas of horror, devastation and ruin. Farther on, other summits\r\nof ice prolong this majestic picture. Among these are the high mountains\r\nof the St. Bernard, and those which border on the Boromean islands.\r\n\r\nPerhaps there is not in the old world a theater more instructive, or\r\nmore adapted for reflection, than the summit of this mountain. Where,\r\nbeside, can be seen such variety and contrast of forms; such results of\r\nthe efforts of time; such effects of all the climates, and of all the\r\nseasons? At one glance may be embraced frosts equally intense with those\r\nof Lapland, and the rich and delightful frontiers of Italy; eternal ice,\r\nand waving harvests; all the chilling horrors of winter, and the\r\nluxuriant vegetation of summer; eighty leagues of fertile plains,\r\ncovered with towns, with vineyards, with fields and herds, and adjoining\r\nto these, a depth of twenty thousand feet of everlasting ice.\r\n\r\n                              MONTSERRAT.\r\n\r\n  “Here, ’midst the changeful scenery, ever new,\r\n  Fancy a thousand wond’rous forms descries,\r\n  More wildly great than ever pencil drew;\r\n  Rocks, torrents, gulfs, and shapes of giant size,\r\n  And glittering cliffs on cliffs, and fiery ramparts rise.”—BEATTIE.\r\n\r\nThis Spanish mountain, which has been so long celebrated on account of\r\nthe singularity of its shape, but chiefly for its convent and its\r\nnumerous hermitages, is nine leagues north-west of Barcelona, in the\r\nprovince of Catalonia. It is in hight only three thousand, three hundred\r\nfeet above the level of the sea, but it commands an enchanting prospect\r\nof the fine plain of Barcelona, extending to the sea, as well as of the\r\nislands of Majorca and Minorca, distant one hundred and fifty miles.\r\n\r\nToward Barcelona this mountain presents a bold and rugged front; but on\r\nthe west, toward Vacarisas, it is almost perpendicular, notwithstanding\r\nwhich, a carriage-road winds round to the convent, which is placed in a\r\nsheltered recess among the rocks, at about half the hight of the\r\nmountain. The Llobregat roars at the bottom; and the rock presents\r\nperpendicular walls from the edge of the water: but above the convent,\r\nthe mountain divides into two crowns or cones, which form the most\r\nprominent features; while smaller pinnacles, blanched and bare, and\r\nsplit into pillars, pipes, and other singular shapes, give a most\r\npicturesque effect. Here are seen fourteen or fifteen hermitages, which\r\nare scattered over different points of the mountain, some of them on the\r\nvery pinnacles of the cones, to which they seem to grow, while others\r\nare placed in cavities hewn out of the loftiest pyramids. The highest\r\naccessible part of the mountain is above the hermitage of St. Maddelena,\r\nthe descent from which is between two cones, by a flight of steps,\r\ncalled Jacob’s ladder, leading into a valley which runs along the summit\r\nof the mountain. The cones are here in the most grotesque shapes, the\r\nsouthern one being named the Organ, from its resemblance to a number of\r\npipes.\r\n\r\nAt the extremity of this valley, which is a perfect shrubbery, and on an\r\neminence, stands the hermitage of St. Jerome, the highest and most\r\nremote of all; and near it is the loftiest station of the whole\r\nmountain, on which is a little chapel dedicated to the Virgin. From this\r\nelevated pinnacle the prospect is vast and splendid.\r\n\r\nAlthough the elements have wreaked all their fury on these shattered\r\npeaks, yet Nature has not been sparing in her gifts; the spaces between\r\nthe rocks being filled up with close woods, while numerous evergreens,\r\nand other plants, serve to adorn the various chasms, rendering them\r\nvaluable depositories of the vegetable kingdom. Few, indeed, are the\r\nevergreens of Europe which may not be found here; and when the mountain\r\nwas visited by Mr. Swinburne, the apothecary of the convent had a list\r\nof four hundred and thirty-seven species of plants, and forty of trees,\r\nwhich shoot up spontaneously, and grace this hoary and venerable pile.\r\nThere being two springs only on the mountain, there is a scarcity of\r\nwater, which is chiefly collected in cisterns; an inconvenience,\r\nhowever, which is in a great measure counterbalanced by the absence of\r\nwolves, bears, and other wild beasts.\r\n\r\nCaptain Carlton, an Englishman, who visited Montserrat some years ago,\r\nascended to the loftiest hermitage, that of St. Jerome, by the means of\r\nspiral steps hewn out in the rock on account of the steep acclivity.\r\nThis, he observes, could not, in his time, be well accomplished by a\r\nstranger, without following the footsteps of an old ass, who carried\r\nfrom the convent a daily supply of food to the hermits. This animal\r\nhaving his two panniers stored with the provisions divided into\r\nportions, climbed without a guide, and having stopped at each of the\r\ncells, where the hermit took the portion allotted to him, returned back\r\nto the convent. He found that one of these hermits, to beguile the\r\nwearisomeness of his solitude, had contrived so effectually to tame the\r\nbirds which frequented the groves surrounding his hermitage, that he\r\ncould draw them together with a whistle, when they perched on his head,\r\nbreast, and shoulders, taking the food from his mouth.\r\n\r\nThe convent is situated on the eastern side of the mountain, which seems\r\nto have been split by vast torrents of water, or by some violent\r\nconvulsion of nature: in this way a platform has been formed in the\r\ncleft, sufficiently ample for the purpose of its construction. It is one\r\nof the forty-five religious houses of the Spanish congregation of the\r\norder of St. Benedict. The monks are bound to supply food and lodging\r\nfor three days to all pilgrims who come up to pay their homage to the\r\nVirgin; besides which, they entertain the hermits on Sundays. The\r\nlatter, who make a vow never to quit the mountain, take their stations\r\nby seniority, the junior hermit being placed at the greatest distance\r\nfrom the convent, and descending progressively as the vacancies happen.\r\nThey are not altogether idle, taking pains to rival each other in making\r\nbasket-work and other fanciful productions, which they display with\r\ngreat affability to their visitors. They assemble every morning to hear\r\nmass and perform divine service, in the parish church of St. Cecilia,\r\nwhich lies considerably above the convent; and twice a week they confess\r\nand communicate. They wear their beards long, and are clad in brown.\r\n\r\nThe church of St. Cecilia is a gloomy edifice, the gilding of which is\r\nmuch sullied by the smoke of eighty-five silver lamps, of various forms\r\nand sizes, suspended round the cornice of the sanctuary. For the supply\r\nof these with oil, funds have been bequeathed by devotees. The choir is\r\ndecorated with wood carvings, curiously wrought, representing the most\r\nprominent passages in the life of Christ.\r\n\r\n                         THE PEAK OF TENERIFFE.\r\n\r\n                            [See cut below.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE PEAK OF TENERIFFE.]\r\n\r\nThe island of Teneriffe has received its present name from the\r\ninhabitants of the adjacent island Palma, in whose language =tener=\r\nsignifies snow, and _iffe_, a hill. In extent, wealth, and fertility it\r\nexceeds all the other Canary islands. It continues to rise on all sides\r\nfrom the sea, until it terminates in the celebrated peak represented in\r\nthe cut, which is, however, situated rather in the southern part than in\r\nthe center of the island. The ascent on the north side is more gradual\r\nthan at the other parts, there being a space along the shore about three\r\nleagues in breadth, bounded on the sides by high mountains, or rather\r\ncliffs; but more inland it rises like a hanging garden all the way,\r\nwithout any considerable interruption of hills or valleys. The form of\r\nthis island is triangular, extending itself into three capes, the\r\nnearest of which is about eighty leagues from the coast of Africa. In\r\nthe middle it is divided by a ridge of mountains, which have been\r\ncompared to the roof of a church, the peak forming the spire or steeple\r\nin the center.\r\n\r\nThe elevation of the peak of Teneriffe, according to the most accurate\r\nmeasurement, made by Cordier, is twelve thousand, one hundred and\r\nsixty-six feet, or nearly two miles and one-third above the level of the\r\nsea. In the ascent, the first eminence is called Monte Verde, or the\r\ngreen mountain, from the high fern with which it is covered, and\r\npresents a level plain of considerable extent. Beyond this is the\r\nmountain of pines, which are said to have formerly grown there in great\r\nabundance; but its steep sides are now craggy and barren, and its whole\r\nappearance very different from that of the eminence described above.\r\nAfter passing this summit, the traveler reaches a plain, on which the\r\nnatives have bestowed the name of Mouton de Trigo, and upon which the\r\npeak in reality stands. It is a mountainous platform, rising more than\r\nseven thousand feet, or nearly a mile and a half, above the level of the\r\nsea; and here the currents of lava, hitherto concealed by the\r\nvegetation, begin to appear in all their aridity and confusion, a few\r\nlowly shrubs and creeping plants alone diversifying the surface of a\r\ndesert, the most arid and rugged that can be imagined.\r\n\r\nA small sandy platform of pumice-stones, bordered by two enormous\r\ncurrents of vitreous lava, and blocks of the same nature, ranged in a\r\nsemicircle, forms what is called the station of the English, on account\r\nof the peak having been so often visited by British travelers. This\r\nplatform is ninety-seven hundred and eighty-six feet, or upward of a\r\nmile and three-quarters above the level of the sea; and beyond it the\r\nacclivity is very steep, great masses of scoriæ, extremely rough and\r\nsharp, covering the currents of lava. Toward the summit, nothing but\r\npumice-stone is to be seen. In fact the peak can only be ascended on the\r\neast and south-east sides. As it is impossible to get round the crater,\r\nthe traveler’s progress is arrested at the spot at which he reaches it.\r\nHere the two orders of volcanic substances are to be seen, the modern\r\nlavas being thrown up amid the ruins of ejections much more ancient, the\r\nimmense masses of which constitute the platform on which the peak is\r\nplaced. The shattered sides present a series of thick beds, almost all\r\nplunging toward the sea, composed alternately of ashes, volcanic sand,\r\npumice-stones, lavas, either compact or porous, and scoriæ.\r\n\r\nAn incalculable number of currents, comparatively recent, which have\r\ndescended from the peak, or have issued from its flanks, form irregular\r\nfurrows, which run along the more ancient masses, and lose themselves in\r\nthe sea to the west and north. Among these currents more than eighty\r\ncraters are scattered, and augment with their ruins the confusion which\r\nprevails throughout.\r\n\r\nThe crater can alone be reached by descending down three chasms. Its\r\nsides are absolutely precipitous within, and are most elevated toward\r\nthe north. Its form is elliptical; its circumference about twelve\r\nhundred feet; and its depth according to Cordier, one hundred and ten\r\nfeet. Humboldt, however, estimates it at not more than from forty to\r\nsixty feet. The sides are, agreeably to the former of these observers,\r\nformed of an earth of snowy whiteness, resulting from the decomposition\r\nof the blackest and hardest vitreous porphyritic lava. All the rest is\r\nsolid, and the lowest part occupied by blocks, which have fallen down\r\nfrom the sides. These solid parts are covered with shining crystals of\r\nsulphur, of a rhomboidal and octahedral figure, some of which are nearly\r\nan inch high, and are, perhaps, the finest specimens of native volcanic\r\nsulphur yet known. Vapors issue in abundance from among these blocks,\r\nand from an infinity of fissures which preserve a very intense heat.\r\nThese vapors consist solely of sulphur and water, perfectly insipid.\r\nBeside the incrustations of sulphur, opal, in thin plates, is formed\r\nwith great celerity. Humboldt regards the peak of Teneriffe as an\r\nenormous basaltic mountain, resting upon a dense secondary calcareous\r\nstone.\r\n\r\nVarious travelers have asserted, that the cold is intensely keen on the\r\nsummit of the peak; that respiration is difficult; and that,\r\nparticularly, spirituous liquors lose all their strength; which latter\r\ncircumstance they ascribe to the spirit being more or less exposed to\r\nthe sulphureous fumes exhaled from the crater. Cordier, and several\r\nother accurate observers, declare, however, that neither the smell nor\r\nthe strength of liquids appeared, at this elevation, to be in the least\r\ndegree impaired; and that volatile alkali, ether, and spirit of wine,\r\npossessed their usual pungency. They add, that the cold is very\r\nsupportable; and that neither the aqueous sulphureous vapors, nor the\r\nrarity of the air, render breathing difficult.\r\n\r\nWe extract the following interesting particulars from Humboldt’s account\r\nof his visit to Teneriffe.\r\n\r\n“Toward three in the morning, by the sombrous light of a few fir\r\ntorches, we began our expedition for the summit of the Piton. We scaled\r\nthe volcano on the north-east, where the declivities are extremely\r\nsteep; and came, after two hours’ toil, to a small plain, which on\r\naccount of its isolated situation, bears the name of Alta Vista. It is\r\nthe station also of the Neveros, those natives whose occupation it is to\r\ncollect ice and snow, which they sell in the neighboring towns. Their\r\nmules, better practiced in climbing mountains than those hired by\r\ntravelers, reach Alta Vista, and the Neveros are obliged to transport\r\nthe snow to this place on their backs. Above this point the Malpays\r\nbegins; a term by which is designated here, as well as in Mexico, Peru,\r\nand every other country subject to volcanoes, a ground destitute of\r\nvegetable mold, and covered with fragments of lavas.\r\n\r\n“We observed, during the twilight, a phenomenon which is not unusual on\r\nhigh mountains, but which the position of the volcano we were scaling\r\nrendered very striking. A layer of white and fleecy clouds concealed\r\nfrom us the sight of the ocean, and the lower region of the island. This\r\nlayer did not appear above sixteen hundred yards high; the clouds were\r\nso uniformly spread, and kept so perfect a level, that they wore the\r\nappearance of a vast plain covered with snow. The colossal pyramid of\r\nthe peak, the volcanic summits of Lanzerota, of Fortaventura, and the\r\nisle of Palma, were like rocks amidst this vast sea of vapors, and their\r\nblack tints were in fine contrast with the whiteness of the clouds.”\r\n\r\nBy an astronomical observation, made at the above elevation at sunrise,\r\nit was ascertained that the true horizon, that is, a part of the sea,\r\nwas distant one hundred and thirty miles. Our traveler proceeds thus:\r\n\r\n“We had yet to scale the steepest part of the mountain, the Piton, which\r\nforms the summit. The slope of this small cone, covered with volcanic\r\nashes, and fragments of pumice-stone, is so steep, that it would have\r\nbeen almost impossible to reach the top, had we not ascended by an old\r\ncurrent of lava, the wrecks of which have resisted the ravages of time.\r\nThese wrecks form a wall of scorious rocks, which stretches itself into\r\nthe midst of the loose ashes. We ascended the Piton by grasping these\r\nhalf-decomposed scoriæ, the sharp edges of which remained often in our\r\nhands. We employed nearly half an hour to scale a hill, the\r\nperpendicular hight of which does not exceed five hundred feet.\r\n\r\n“When we gained the summit of the Piton, we were surprised to find\r\nscarcely room enough to seat ourselves conveniently. The west wind blew\r\nwith such violence that we could scarcely stand. It was eight in the\r\nmorning, and we were frozen with cold, though the thermometer kept a\r\nlittle above the freezing point.\r\n\r\n“The wall, which surrounds the crater like a parapet, is so high, that\r\nit would be impossible to reach the Caldera, if on the eastern side\r\nthere was not a breach, which seems to have been the effect of a flowing\r\nof very old lava. We descended through this breach toward the bottom of\r\nthe tunnel, the figure of which is elliptical. The greatest breadth of\r\nthe mouth appeared to us to be three hundred feet, the smallest two\r\nhundred feet.\r\n\r\n“We descended to the bottom of the crater on a train of broken lava,\r\nfrom the eastern breach of the inclosure. The heat was perceptible only\r\nin a few crevices, which gave vent to aqueous vapors, with a peculiar\r\nbuzzing noise. Some of these funnels or Crevices are on the outside of\r\nthe inclosure, on the external brink of the parapet that surrounds the\r\ncrater. We plunged the thermometer into them, and saw it rise rapidly to\r\nsixty-eight and seventy-five degrees.\r\n\r\n“We prolonged in vain our stay on the summit of the peak, to wait the\r\nmoment when we might enjoy the view of the whole of the archipelago of\r\nthe Fortunate islands. We discovered Palma, Gomera, and the Great\r\nCanary, at our feet. The mountains of Lanzerota, free from vapors at\r\nsunrise, were soon enveloped in thick clouds. On a supposition only of\r\nan ordinary refraction, the eye takes in, in calm weather, from the\r\nsummit of the volcano, a surface of the globe of fifty-seven hundred\r\nsquare leagues, equal to a fourth of the surface of Spain.\r\n\r\n“Notwithstanding the heat we felt in our feet on the edge of the crater,\r\nthe cone of ashes remains covered with snow during several months in the\r\nwinter. It is probable, that under the cap of snow considerable hollows\r\nare found, like those we find under the glaciers of Switzerland, the\r\ntemperature of which is constantly less elevated than that of the soil\r\non which they repose. The cold and violent wind which blew from the time\r\nof sunrise, engaged us to seek shelter at the foot of the Piton. Our\r\nhands and faces were frozen, while our boots were burnt by the soil on\r\nwhich we walked. We descended in the space of a few minutes the\r\nsugar-loaf, which we had scaled with so much toil; and this rapidity was\r\nin part involuntary, for we often rolled down on the ashes. It was with\r\nregret that we quitted this solitary place, this domain where Nature\r\ntowers in all her majesty.”\r\n\r\nTo the above we subjoin the following extract from the account published\r\nin the first volume of the Transactions of the Geological Society, by\r\nthe Hon. Mr. Bennet.\r\n\r\nAt the distance of thirty-four leagues from the island, Mr. Bennet had a\r\nvery distinct view of the peak, rising like a cone from the bed of the\r\nocean. The rocks and strata of Teneriffe, he observes, are wholly\r\nvolcanic, the long chain of mountains, which may be termed the central\r\nchain, traversing the island from the foot of the second region of the\r\npeak, and sloping down on the eastern, western and northern sides, to\r\nthe sea. Toward the south, or more properly the south-south-west, the\r\nmountains are nearly perpendicular, and though broken into ridges, and\r\noccasionally separated by deep ravines, that are cut transversely as\r\nwell as longitudinally, there are none of those plains, nor that gradual\r\ndeclination of strata, which the south-eastern and north-western sides\r\nof the island exhibit.\r\n\r\nMr. Bennet ascended the peak in the month of September, 1810. We give\r\nthe abridged details of this expedition in his own words.\r\n\r\n“The road to the city of Orotava, is a gradual and easy slope for three\r\nor four miles, through a highly cultivated country. Leaving the town,\r\nafter a steep ascent of about an hour, through a deep ravine, we quitted\r\nthe cultivated part, and entered into forests of chestnuts, the trees of\r\nwhich are of a large size. The form of this forest is oblong; the soil\r\nis deep, and formed of decomposed lava, small ash and pumice. I examined\r\nseveral channels in the strata, or ravines worn by the rains, and there\r\nwas no appearance of any other rock. Leaving this forest, the track\r\npasses over a series of green hills, which we traversed in about two\r\nhours, and at last halted to water our mules at a spot where there is a\r\nsmall spring of bad and brackish water issuing from a lava rock. The\r\nravine is of considerable depth. The range of green hills extends a mile\r\nor two further, the soil shallowing by degrees, until at length the\r\ntrees and shrubs gradually dwindling in size, the Spanish broom alone\r\ncovers the ground. Leaving behind us this range of green hills, the\r\ntrack, still ascending, leads for several hours across a steep and\r\ndifficult mass of lava-rock, broken here and there into strange and\r\nfantastic forms, worn into deep ravines, and scantly covered in places\r\nby a thin layer of yellow pumice. As we proceeded on our road, the hills\r\non our left gradually rose in hight, till the summits were lost in those\r\nof the central chain; while, on our right, we were rapidly gaining an\r\nelevation above the lower range of the peak. We met with several small\r\nconical hills, or mouths of extinct volcanoes, the decomposed lava on\r\nthe edges of the craters having a strong red ochreous tint. At length,\r\nan immense undulated plain spreads itself like a fan, on all sides,\r\nnearly as far as the eye can reach. This plain is bounded on the\r\nwest-south-west and south-south-west, by the regions of the peak; and on\r\nthe east and north-east, by a range of steep perpendicular precipices\r\nand mountains, many leagues in circumference, called by the Spaniards\r\n=Las Faldas=. On this plain, or desert, for we had long left all show of\r\nvegetation, except a few stunted plants of Spanish broom, a sensible\r\nchange was felt in the atmosphere; the wind was keen and sharp, and the\r\nclimate like that of England in the months of autumn. All here was sad,\r\nsilent and solitary. We saw at a distance the fertile plains on the\r\ncoast, lying as it were under our feet, and affording a cheerful\r\ncontrast to the scenes of desolation with which we were surrounded. We\r\nwere already seven or eight thousand feet above the level of the sea,\r\nand had reached the bottom of the second region of the peak.\r\n\r\n“Having reached the end of the plain, we found ourselves at the bottom\r\nof a steep hill, at the foot of which is a mass or current of lava.\r\nAfter a laborious, not to say hazardous ascent of about an hour, the\r\npumice and ash gave way, and the mules sinking knee-deep at every step,\r\nwe arrived at about five in the afternoon at the other extremity of the\r\nstream of lava, which, descending from the summit of the second region\r\nof the peak, divides at the foot of the cone into two branches, the one\r\nrunning to the north-east, and the other to the north-west. It was here\r\nwe were to pass the night; so, lighting a fire made of dry branches of\r\nthe Spanish broom, and stretching a part of a sail over a portion of the\r\nrock, we ate our dinner and laid ourselves down to sleep. I, however,\r\npassed the best part of the night by the fire, the weather being\r\npiercingly cold. As I stood by the fire, the view all around me was wild\r\nand terrific; the moon rose about ten at night, and, though in her third\r\nquarter, gave sufficient light to show the waste and wilderness by which\r\nwe were surrounded. The peak and the upper regions which we had yet to\r\nascend, towered awfully above our heads, while below, the mountains that\r\nhad appeared of such a hight in the morning, and had cost us a day’s\r\nlabor to climb, lay stretched as plains at our feet. From the uncommon\r\nrarity of the atmosphere, the whole vault of heaven appeared studded\r\nwith innumerable stars, while the valleys of Orotava were hidden from\r\nour view by a thin vail of light fleecy clouds, that floated far beneath\r\nthe elevated spot we had chosen for our resting-place; the solemn\r\nstillness of the night was only interrupted by the crackling of the fire\r\nround which we stood, and by the whistling of the wind, which coming in\r\nhollow gusts from the mountain, resembled the roar of distant cannon.\r\n\r\n“Between two and three in the morning, we resumed, on foot, our ascent\r\nof the mountain, the lower part of which we had climbed on horseback the\r\npreceding evening; the ascent, however, became much more rapid and\r\ndifficult, our feet sinking deep in the ashes at every step. From the\r\nuncommon sharpness of the acclivity, we were obliged to stop often to\r\ntake breath: after several halts, we at last reached the head of the\r\npumice hill. After resting some short time here, we began to climb the\r\nstream of lava, stepping from mass to mass. The ascent is steep, painful\r\nand hazardous; in some places the stream of lava is heaped up in dykes\r\nor embankments; and we were obliged to clamber over them as one ascends\r\na steep wall.\r\n\r\n“We halted several times during the ascent, and at last reached a spot\r\ncalled La Cueva, one of the numerous caves that are found on the sides\r\nof the mountain; this is the largest of them, and is filled with snow\r\nand the most delicious water, which was just at the point of\r\ncongelation. The descent into it is difficult, it being thirty or forty\r\nfeet deep. One of our party let himself down by a rope: he could not see\r\nthe extent of the cave, but the guides declared it to be three hundred\r\nfeet in length, and to contain thirty or forty feet of water in depth.\r\nThe roof and sides are composed of a fine stalactitic lava, similar to\r\nthat found on Vesuvius, and it is of the same nature as that which\r\nflowed on the surface. We rested here about half an hour, during which\r\nwe had an opportunity of observing the rising of the sun, and that\r\nsingular and rapid change of night into day, which is the consequence of\r\nan almost entire absence of twilight. As we ascended the north-east side\r\nof the mountain, this view was strikingly beautiful: at first there\r\nappeared a bright streak of red on the horizon, which gradually spread\r\nitself, lighting up the heavens by degrees, and growing brighter and\r\nbrighter, till at last the sun burst forth from the bed of the ocean,\r\ngilding as it rose the mountains of Teneriffe, and those of the Great\r\nCanary; in a short time the whole country to the eastward lay spread out\r\nas a map. The Great Canary was easily to be distinguished; and its\r\nrugged and mountainous character, similar to that of the other islands,\r\nbecame visible to the naked eye. The cold at this time was intense, the\r\nwind keen and strong, and the thermometer sunk to thirty-two degrees.\r\nAfter a short though rapid ascent, we reached the summit of the second\r\nstage of the mountain, passing over a small plain of white pumice, on\r\nwhich were spread masses of lava, and at length arrived at the foot of\r\nthe cone. This division of the mountain forms what is generally termed\r\nthe peak of Teneriffe: it represents the present crater of Vesuvius,\r\nwith this difference, however, that while the surface of that mountain\r\nis composed of a black cinder or ash, the superfices of this appear to\r\nbe a deposit of pumice of a white color, of scoriæ and lava, with here\r\nand there considerable masses that were probably thrown out when the\r\nvolcano was in action. Numerous small cavities on the side of the\r\nmountain emitted vapor, with considerable heat. Here begins the only\r\nfatiguing part of the ascent; the steepness of the cone is excessive; at\r\neach step our feet sunk into the ash, and large masses of pumice and\r\nlava rolled down from above; we were all bruised, and our feet and legs\r\nwere cut, but not materially hurt: at last we surmounted all\r\ndifficulties, and seated ourselves on the highest ridge of the mountain.\r\nThis uppermost region does not appear to contain in superficies more\r\nthan an acre and a half, and is itself a small crater, the walls of\r\nwhich are the different points on which we sat, and are plainly visible\r\nfrom below. Within, the lava is in the most rapid state of\r\ndecomposition. The surface is hot to the feet, and the guides said it\r\nwas dangerous to remain long in one spot: as it was, some of us sunk to\r\nour knees in the hot deposit of sulphur. Upon striking the ground with\r\nthe feet, the sound is hollow, similar to what is produced by the same\r\nimpulsion on the craters of Vesuvius and Solfaterra. I estimate the\r\ndepth of the crater to be, from the highest ridge to the bottom, about\r\ntwo hundred feet, forming an easy and gradual descent.\r\n\r\n“The view from the summit is stupendous: we could plainly discover the\r\nwhole form of the island, and we made out distinctly three or four of\r\nthe islands, which, collectively, are called the Canaries; we could not,\r\nhowever, see Lancerotte or Fuerteventura, though we were told that other\r\ntravelers had distinguished them all.\r\n\r\n“From this spot, the central chain of mountains that run from south-west\r\nto north-east, is easily to be distinguished. These, with the succession\r\nof fertile and woody valleys, commencing from San Ursula, and ending at\r\nLas Horcas, with the long line of precipitous lava rocks that lay on the\r\nright of our ascent, and which traverse that part of the island running\r\nfrom east to west, from their point of departure at the Canales, to\r\nwhere they end in an abrupt headland on the coast, with their forests,\r\nand villages, and vineyards, the port with the shipping in the roads,\r\nthe town of Orotava, with its spires glittering as the morning sun burst\r\nupon them, afford a cheerful contrast to the streams of lava, the mounds\r\nof ash and pumice, and the sulphurated rock on which we had taken our\r\nseat. The sensation of extreme hight was in fact one of the most\r\nextraordinary I ever felt; and though I did not find the pain in my\r\nchest arising from the rarity of the atmosphere, by any means so acute\r\nas on the mountains of Switzerland, yet there was a keenness in the air,\r\nindependent of the cold, that created no small uneasiness in the lungs.\r\nThe respiration became short and quick, and repeated halts were found\r\nnecessary. The idea also of extreme hight was to me more determinate and\r\nprecise than on the mountains of Switzerland; and though the immediate\r\nobjects of vision were not so numerous, yet as the ascent is more rapid,\r\nthe declivity sharper, and there is here no mountain like Mont Blanc\r\ntowering above you, the twelve thousand feet above the level of the sea\r\nappeared considerably more than a similar elevation above the lake of\r\nGeneva. We remained at the summit about three-quarters of an hour, our\r\nascent having cost us the labor of four hours, as we left La Estancia at\r\nten minutes before three, and reached the top of the peak before seven.\r\nOur thermometer, which was graduated to the scale of Fahrenheit, was,\r\nduring our ascent, as follows: at Orotava, at eight in the morning,\r\nseventy-four degrees; at six in the evening, at La Estancia, fifty\r\ndegrees; at one, in the following morning, forty-two degrees; at La\r\nCueva, at half past four, thirty-two degrees; at the bottom of the cone,\r\nthirty-six degrees; at the top of the peak, one hour and a half after\r\nsunrise, thirty-three degrees. The descent down the cone is difficult,\r\nfrom its extreme rapidity, and from the fall of large stones, which\r\nloosen themselves from the beds of pumice. Having at last scrambled to\r\nthe bottom, we pursued our march down the other course of the lava, that\r\nis to say, down its westerly side, having ascended its eastern. The\r\nravines and rents in this stream of lava are deep and formidable; the\r\ndescent into them is always painful and troublesome, often dangerous: in\r\nsome places we let ourselves down from rock to rock. I can form no\r\nopinion why there should be these strange irregularities in the surface\r\nof this lava; in places it resembles what sailors term the trough of the\r\nsea, and I can compare it to nothing but as if the sea in a storm, had\r\nby some force become on a sudden stationary, the waves retaining their\r\nswell. As we again approached La Cueva, we came to a singular steep\r\nvalley, the depth of which, from its two sides, can not be less than one\r\nhundred to one hundred and fifty feet, the lava lying in broken ridges\r\none upon the other, similar to the masses of granite rock that time and\r\ndecay have tumbled down from the top of the Alps; and, except from the\r\nscoriæ, or what Milton calls ‘the fiery surge,’ they in no degree bear\r\nthe marks of having rolled as a stream of liquid matter.\r\n\r\n“We descended the pumice hill with great rapidity, almost at a run, and\r\narrived at La Estancia in little more than two hours. We then mounted\r\nour mules, and following the track by which we had ascended the\r\npreceding day, we reached, about four o’clock, the country-house from\r\nwhich we had started.”\r\n\r\nThe first eruption of which there is any distinct account, occurred on\r\nthe twenty-fourth of December, 1704, when twenty-nine shocks of an\r\nearthquake were distinctly felt. On the thirty-first a great light was\r\nobserved on Manja, toward the White mountains. Here the earth opened,\r\nand two volcanoes were formed, which threw up such heaps of stones as to\r\nraise two considerable mountains: the combustible matter, which still\r\ncontinued to be thrown up, kindled above fifty fires in the vicinity.\r\nThe whole country for three leagues round was in flames, which were\r\nincreased by another volcano opening by at least thirty different vents\r\nwithin the circumference of half a mile. On the second of February\r\nfollowing, another volcano broke out in the town of Guimar, swallowing\r\nup a large church.\r\n\r\nA subsequent eruption in 1706 filled up the port of Guarachico. The\r\nlava, in its descent, ran five leagues in six hours; and on this lava,\r\nhouses are now built where ships formerly rode at anchor. Neither of\r\nthese eruptions was from the crater on the summit of the peak, for that\r\nhas not ejected lava for centuries, and it now issues from the flanks\r\nonly. The last eruption was on the ninth of June, 1798, and was very\r\nterrible. Three new mouths opened at the hight of eighty-one hundred and\r\nthirty feet, or upward of a mile and a half above the level of the sea,\r\nupon the inclined slope of the base of the peak toward the south-west.\r\nAbove this, at the hight of ten thousand, two hundred and forty feet, or\r\nnearly two miles, M. Cordier found a vast crater nearly four miles and a\r\nhalf in circumference, which lie ascertained to be very ancient. Its\r\nsides are extremely steep, and it still presents the most frightful\r\npicture of the violence of subterraneous fire. The peak rises from the\r\nsides of this monstrous aperture. To the south-west is the mountain of\r\nCahora, which is said to have become a volcano in 1797. The other\r\nmountains of Teneriffe, which tradition reports to have been formerly\r\nvolcanoes, are Monte Roxo, or the red mountain; several mountains,\r\ncalled the Malpasses, lying to the eastward; and one (Rejada) in a\r\nsouthern direction. Throughout the whole of the distance between Monte\r\nRoxo and the bay of Adexe, according to Mr. Glass, the shore is about\r\ntwenty-five hundred feet, or nearly half a mile in hight, and\r\nperpendicular as a wall. The southern coast has a much superior\r\nelevation, the chain of mountains by which it is bounded being,\r\nagreeably to St. Vincent, eighty-three hundred and twenty feet, or more\r\nthan a mile and a half, above the level of the sea.\r\n\r\n                        THE SOUFFRIERE MOUNTAIN.\r\n\r\nThis volcanic mountain, the dreadful eruption of which we are about to\r\ndescribe, is the most elevated and most northerly of the lofty chain\r\nrunning through the West India island of St. Vincent. From the\r\nextraordinary frequency and violence of the earthquakes, which in 1811,\r\nare calculated to have exceeded two hundred, some great movement or\r\neruption was looked for. In the interim the mountain indicated much\r\ndisquietude; but the apprehension was not so immediate as to restrain\r\ncuriosity, or to prevent repeated visits to the crater, which had\r\nlatterly been more numerous than ever. Even on the twenty-sixth of\r\nApril, 1812, the day preceding the eruption, several gentlemen ascended\r\nand remained there for some time. Nothing unusual was then remarked, nor\r\nany external difference observed, except rather a stronger emission of\r\nsmoke from the interstices of the conical hill, at the bottom of the\r\ncrater. To those who have not visited this romantic and wonderful spot,\r\na slight description of it, as it lately stood, is previously necessary.\r\n\r\n“About two thousand feet from the level of the sea, on the south side of\r\nthe mountain, and at rather more than two-thirds of its hight, opens a\r\ncircular chasm, somewhat exceeding half a mile in diameter, and between\r\nfour hundred and five hundred feet in depth. Exactly in the center of\r\nthis capacious bowl, rose a conical hill about two hundred and sixty or\r\nthree hundred feet in hight, and about two hundred in diameter, richly\r\ncovered and variegated with shrubs, brushwood and vines, above half-way\r\nup, and the remainder covered over with virgin sulphur to the top. From\r\nthe fissures of the cone and interstices of the rocks, a thin white\r\nsmoke was constantly emitted, occasionally tinged with a slight bluish\r\nflame. The precipitous sides of this magnificent amphitheater were\r\nfringed with various evergreens and aromatic shrubs, flowers, and many\r\nalpine plants. On the north and south sides of the base of the cone were\r\ntwo pieces of water, one perfectly pure and tasteless, the other\r\nstrongly impregnated with sulphur and alum. This lonely and beautiful\r\nspot was rendered more enchanting by the singularly melodious notes of a\r\nbird, an inhabitant of these upper solitudes, and altogether unknown to\r\nthe other parts of the island, hence principally called or supposed to\r\nbe invisible, though it certainly has been seen, and is a species of\r\nblackbird.\r\n\r\n“A century had now elapsed since the last convulsion of the mountain, or\r\nsince any other elements had disturbed the serenity of this wilderness,\r\nbesides those which are common to the tropical tempest. It apparently\r\nslumbered in primeval solitude and tranquillity, and from the luxuriant\r\nvegetation and growth of the forest, which covered its side from the\r\nbase nearly to the summit, seemed to discountenance the fact, and\r\nfalsify the records of the ancient volcano. Such was the majestic,\r\npeaceful Souffriere, on April the twenty-seventh; but our imaginary\r\nsafety was soon to be confounded by the sudden danger of devastation.\r\nJust as the plantation bell rang at noon on that day, an abrupt and\r\ndreadful crash from the mountain, with a severe concussion of the earth,\r\nand tremulous noise in the air, alarmed all around it. The resurrection\r\nof this fiery furnace was proclaimed in a moment by a vast column of\r\nthick, black, ropy smoke, like that of an immense glass-house, bursting\r\nforth at once, and mounting to the sky; showering down sand, gritty\r\ncalcined particles of earth and ashes mixed, on all below. This, driven\r\nbefore the wind toward Wallibou and Morne Ronde, darkened the air like a\r\ncataract of rain, and covered the ridges, woods and cane-pieces with\r\nlight gray-colored ashes, resembling snow when slightly covered by dust.\r\nAs the eruption increased, this continual shower expanded, destroying\r\nevery appearance of vegetation. At night a very considerable degree of\r\nignition was observed on the lips of the crater; but it is not asserted\r\nthat there was as yet any visible ascension of flame. The same awful\r\nscene presented itself on the following day; the fall of ashes and\r\ncalcined pebbles still increasing, and the compact, pitchy column from\r\nthe crater rising perpendicularly to an immense hight, with a noise at\r\nintervals like the muttering of distant thunder.\r\n\r\n“On Wednesday, the twenty-ninth, all these menacing symptoms of horror\r\nand combustion still gathered more thick and terrific for miles around\r\nthe dismal and half-obscured mountain. The prodigious column shot up\r\nwith quicker motion, dilating as it rose like a balloon. The sun\r\nappeared in total eclipse, and shed a meridian of twilight over us, that\r\naggravated the wintry gloom of the scene, now completely powdered over\r\nwith falling particles. It was evident that the crisis was yet to come,\r\nthat the burning fluid was struggling for a vent, and laboring to throw\r\noff the superincumbent strata and obstructions, which suppressed its\r\ntorrent. At night, it was manifest that it had greatly disengaged itself\r\nfrom its burden, by the appearance of fire flashing above the mouth of\r\nthe crater.\r\n\r\n“On the memorable thirtieth of April, the reflection of the rising sun\r\non this majestic body of curling vapor was sublime beyond imagination:\r\nany comparison of the Glaciers, or of the Andes, can but feebly convey\r\nan idea of the fleecy whiteness and brilliancy of this awful column of\r\nintermingled and wreathed smoke and clouds. It afterward assumed a more\r\nsulphureous cast, like what are called thunder-clouds, and in the course\r\nof the day had a ferruginous and sanguine appearance, with a much\r\nlivelier action in the ascent, and a more extensive dilatation, as if\r\nalmost freed from every obstruction. In the afternoon, the noise was\r\nincessant, and resembled the approach of thunder still nearer and\r\nnearer, with a vibration that affected the feelings and hearing: as yet\r\nthere was no convulsive motion, or sensible earthquake. The Charaibs\r\nsettled at Morne Ronde, at the foot of the Souffriere, abandoned their\r\nhouses, with their live stock, and everything they possessed, and fled\r\nprecipitately toward town. The negroes became confused, forsook their\r\nwork, looked up to the mountain, and, as it shook, trembled, with the\r\ndread of what they could neither understand or describe: the birds fell\r\nto the ground, overpowered with showers of ashes, unable to keep\r\nthemselves on the wing; the cattle were starving for want of food, as\r\nnot a blade of grass or a leaf was now to be found; the sea was much\r\ndiscolored, but not uncommonly agitated; and it is remarkable, that\r\nthroughout the whole of this violent disturbance of the earth, it\r\ncontinued quite passive, and did not at any time sympathize with the\r\nagitation of the land. About four o’clock in the afternoon, the noise\r\nbecame more alarming, and just before sunset the clouds reflected a\r\nbright copper color, suffused with fire. Scarcely had the day closed,\r\nwhen the flames burst at length pyramidically from the crater, through\r\nthe mass of smoke; the rolling of the thunder became more awful and\r\ndeafening; electric flashes quickly succeeded, attended with loud claps;\r\nand now, indeed, the tumult began. Those only who have witnessed such a\r\nsight, can form any idea of the magnificence and variety of the\r\nlightning and electric flashes; some forked and zigzag, playing across\r\nthe perpendicular column from the crater; others shooting upward from\r\nthe mouth like rockets of the most dazzling luster; others like shells,\r\nwith their trailing fuses, flying in different parabolas, with the most\r\nvivid scintillations, from the dark sanguine column, which now seemed\r\ninflexible, and immovable by the wind. Shortly after seven in the\r\nafternoon, the mighty caldron was seen to simmer, and the ebullition of\r\nlava to break out on the north-west side. This, immediately after\r\nboiling over the orifice, and flowing a short way, was opposed by the\r\nacclivity of a higher point of land, over which it was impelled by the\r\nimmense tide of liquefied fire which drove it on, forming the figure V\r\nin grand illumination. Sometimes, when the ebullition slackened, or was\r\ninsufficient to urge it over the obstructing hill, it recoiled like a\r\nrefluent billow, from the rock, and then again rushed forward, impelled\r\nby fresh supplies, and, surmounting every obstacle, carried rocks and\r\nwoods together, in its course down the slope of the mountain, until it\r\nprecipitated itself down some vast ravine, concealed from our sight by\r\nthe intervening ridges of Morne Ronde. Vast globular bodies of fire were\r\nseen projected from the fiery furnace, and, bursting, fell back into it,\r\nor over it upon the surrounding bushes, which were instantly set in\r\nflames. About four hours from the time of the lava’s boiling over the\r\ncrater, it reached the sea, as we could observe from the reflection of\r\nthe fire and electric flashes attending it. About half past one, the\r\nfollowing morning, another stream of lava was seen descending to the\r\neastward toward Rabacca. The thundering noise of the mountain, and the\r\nvibration of sound that had been so formidable hitherto, now mingled in\r\nthe sudden monotonous roar of the rolling lava, became so terrible, that\r\ndismay was almost turned into despair. At this time the first earthquake\r\nwas felt; this was followed by showers of cinders, which fell with the\r\nhissing noise of hail, during two hours.\r\n\r\n“At three o’clock, a rolling on the roofs of the houses indicated a fall\r\nof stones, which soon thickened, and at length descended in a rain of\r\nintermingled fire, which threatened at once the fate of Pompeii or\r\nHerculaneum. The crackling coruscations from the crater at this period\r\nexceeded all that had yet passed. The eyes were struck with a momentary\r\nblindness, and the ears stunned with a confusion of sounds. People\r\nsought shelter in the cellars, under rocks, or anywhere, for every place\r\nwas nearly the same; and the miserable negroes, flying from their huts,\r\nwere knocked down, or wounded, and many killed in the open air. Several\r\nhouses were set on fire. The estates situated in the immediate vicinity,\r\nseemed doomed to destruction. Had the stones which fell been heavy in\r\nproportion to their size, not a living creature could have escaped\r\ndeath: these, having undergone a thorough fusion, were divested of their\r\nnatural gravity, and fell almost as light as pumice, though in some\r\nplaces as large as a man’s head. This dreadful rain of stones and fire\r\nlasted upward of an hour, and was again succeeded by cinders from three\r\ntill six o’clock in the morning. Earthquake followed earthquake, almost\r\nmomentarily; or rather the whole of this part of the island was in a\r\nstate of continued oscillation; not agitated by shocks vertical or\r\nhorizontal; but undulated like water shaken in a bowl.\r\n\r\n“The break of day, if such it could be called, was truly terrific. Utter\r\ndarkness prevailed till eight o’clock, and the birth of May dawned like\r\nthe day of judgment: a chaotic gloom enveloped the mountain, and an\r\nimpenetrable haze hung over the sea, with black sluggish clouds of a\r\nsulphureous cast. The whole island was covered with cinders, scoriæ, and\r\nbroken masses of volcanic matter. It was not until the afternoon, that\r\nthe muttering noise of the mountain sunk gradually into a solemn yet\r\nsuspicious silence. Such are the particulars of this sublime and\r\ntremendous scene, from its commencement to its catastrophe.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                        PETER BOTTE’S MOUNTAIN.\r\n\r\n                          [See cut, page 74.]\r\n\r\nThe singular peak represented in the cut, is in the island of Mauritius,\r\nwhich lies in the Indian ocean, east of Madagascar. The island is about\r\none hundred and forty miles in circuit, and produces rice, sugar,\r\ncloves, indigo, and various tropical fruits. It was first settled by the\r\nDutch; but the French gained possession of it in 1715. In 1810, the\r\nEnglish took it, and it is still held by them. The island seems to have\r\nbeen thrown up from the sea by volcanic eruptions, as it everywhere\r\nbears marks of convulsions by inward fires. In its central parts are\r\nwild craggy mountains, the summits of which are always covered with\r\nsnow. And among these is the peak represented in the cut, which is\r\neighteen hundred feet in hight, and surrounded by dismal ravines. It is\r\ncalled Peter Botte’s mountain, from a legend that a man of that name\r\nonce ascended to the top. The general belief, however, is, that it was\r\nnever ascended till the year 1832, when the top of it was reached by a\r\nparty under Capt. Lloyd, an English engineer. The exploit was one of the\r\nmost hazardous, and the account of it is almost painful to the reader,\r\nfrom the evident peril of the adventurers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PETER BOTTE’S MOUNTAIN.]\r\n\r\n                                KILAUEA.\r\n\r\nWhile on the subject of wonderful volcanoes, we must not omit to notice\r\none that has been called the “Niagara of volcanoes,” and the “king of\r\nvolcanoes,” =viz.=, Kilauea, the great volcano of the Sandwich islands,\r\nwhich is on the island of Hawaii, about thirty miles from Hilo bay. One\r\nof the missionaries, from whom we have the account, started to visit it\r\non horseback; but the way being rough and the animal unshod, he severely\r\nfelt the inconvenience of the lava, became discouraged, and moved so\r\nslowly, that he was given up, and the missionary and his associate\r\nproceeded on foot.\r\n\r\n“Toward evening,” he continues, “we reached Olaa, an inland settlement;\r\nand the next day, before noon, had arrived at an elevation of some four\r\nthousand feet, at a distance of twenty miles from Hilo bay.\r\n\r\n“Approaching the great crater of Kilauea, we had a fine view of the\r\nmagnificent dome of Mauna Loa, stretching on some twenty miles beyond\r\nit, and rising above it to the lofty hight of ten thousand feet.\r\nEvidences of existing volcanic agency multiplied around us; steam, gas\r\nand smoke, issued from the sulphur banks on the north-east and\r\nsouth-east sides of the crater, and here and there, from deep and\r\nextended fissures connected with the fiery subterranean agency; and as\r\nwe passed circumspectly along the apparently depressed plain that\r\nsurrounds the crater, we observed an immense volume of smoke and vapor\r\nascending from the midst of it. At the same time, and from the same\r\nsource, various unusual sounds, not easily described or explained, fell\r\nwith increasing intensity on the ear. Then the angry abyss, the fabled\r\nhabitation and throne of _Pele_, the great idol goddess whom the\r\nHawaiians formerly worshiped, opened before us.\r\n\r\n“Coming near to the rim, I fell upon my hands and knees, awe-struck, and\r\ncrept cautiously to the rocky brink; for with all my natural and\r\nacquired courage, I was unwilling at once to walk up to the giddy verge,\r\nand look down upon the noisy, fiery gulf beneath my feet. Shortly,\r\nhowever, I was able to stand very near, and gaze upon this wonder of the\r\nworld, which I wish I could set before my readers, in all its mystery,\r\nmagnitude and grandeur. It is not a lofty cone, or mountain-top pointing\r\nto the heavens, but a vast chasm in the earth, five or six times the\r\ndepth of Niagara falls, and seven or eight miles in circumference. It is\r\nsituated on the flank of a vast mountain, which has been gradually piled\r\nup by a similar agency during the course of ages. Such is the immense\r\nextent and depth of Kilauea, that it would take in, entire, the city of\r\nPhiladelphia or New York, and make their loftiest spires, viewed from\r\nthe rim, appear small and low. But neither cities nor meadows, nor water\r\nnor vegetation, can be found in this chief of the deep places of the\r\nearth, but a lake of lava, some black and indurated, some fiery and\r\nflowing, some cooling as a floating bridge over the fathomless molten\r\nabyss, seven times hotter than Nebuchadnezzar’s hottest furnace, and\r\nsome bursting up through this temporary incrustation, rending it here\r\nand there, and forming mounds and cones upon it. The immense mass,\r\nlaboring to escape, pressed against the great crater’s sides, which\r\nconsist not of a frail ‘Chinese wall,’ built by human hands to resist\r\nhuman strength, but an irregularly elliptical wall of basaltic rocks,\r\nextending a thousand feet above the surface of the lava lake, and to\r\nunknown depths below. Six hundred feet below, the verge stretches around\r\nhorizontally, a vast amphitheater gallery of black indurated lava, once\r\nfluid but now solid, and on which an army of a hundred thousand men\r\nmight stand to view the sublime spectacle beneath, around, and above\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n“While through the eye, the impressions of grandeur, strong at first,\r\nincreased till the daylight was gone, the impressions received through\r\nthe ear, were peculiar, and by no means inconsiderable. The fiercely\r\nwhizzing sound of gas and steam, rushing with varying force through\r\nobstructed apertures in blowing cones, or cooling crusts of lava, and\r\nthe laboring, wheezing, struggling, as of a living mountain, breathing\r\nfire and smoke and sulphurous gas from his lurid nostrils, tossing up\r\nmolten rocks or detached portions of fluid lava, and breaking up vast\r\nindurated masses with varied detonations, all impressively bade us stand\r\nin awe. When we reached the verge, or whenever we came from a little\r\ndistance to look over, these strange sounds increased, as if some\r\nintelligent power, with threatening tones and gestures, indignant at our\r\nobtrusiveness, were forbidding us to approach. The effect of all this on\r\naboriginal visitors, before the true God was made known to them, may\r\nhave been to induce or confirm the superstition, that a deity or family\r\nof deities dwelt there, and recognized the movements of men, and in\r\nvarious ways expressed anger against them. If my native fellow-travelers\r\nhad not been cured of their superstition, or had not known me to be\r\nopposed to all idolatry, and particularly to the worship of Pele, the\r\ngoddess whom they once supposed dwelt there, they might naturally have\r\nmistaken my almost involuntary prostration, as an act of religious\r\nhomage to this discarded Hawaiian deity. But the missionaries had set at\r\nnaught the _tabus_ of this deity, and Kapiolani had openly invaded the\r\nsame, and descending into this crater had, in a fearless and Christian\r\nmanner, there acknowledged Jehovah as the only true God, and proclaimed\r\nto her countrymen that this was but one of the fires which he has\r\nkindled and controls. So that the natives now with me were ready\r\ndevoutly to acknowledge all this.\r\n\r\n“When seven years before our visit, Messrs. Ellis, Thurston, Bishop and\r\nGoodrich, accompanied by Mr. Harwood, visited this yawning gulf, they\r\nsaid of it: ‘The bottom was filled with lava, and the south-west and\r\nnorthern parts of it were one vast flood of liquid fire, in a state of\r\nterrific ebullition, rolling to and fro its fiery surge and flaming\r\nbillows. Fifty-one craters of various forms and sizes, rose, like so\r\nmany conical islands from the surface of the burning lake. Twenty-two\r\nconstantly emitted columns of gray smoke and pyramids of brilliant\r\nflame, and many of them at the same time vomited from their ignited\r\nmouths, streams of fluid lava, which rolled in blazing torrents down\r\ntheir black, indented sides, into the boiling mass of fire below.’ The\r\nsurface of this body of lava is subject to unceasing changes from year\r\nto year; for ‘deep calleth unto deep’ continually, and the fiery billows\r\nof this troubled ocean never rest.\r\n\r\n“As night came on we took our station on the north side of the very\r\nbrink, where we supposed we should be able most securely and\r\nsatisfactorily to watch the action of this awful laboratory during the\r\nabsence of the light of the sun. Though the spot where we spread our\r\nblanket for a lodgment had been considered as the safest in the\r\nneighborhood, there was room for the feeling of insecurity which some\r\nwho had preceded us have thus described. ‘The detachment of one small\r\nstone beneath, or a slight agitation of the earth, would have\r\nprecipitated us, amid the horrid crash of falling rocks, into the\r\nburning lake.’ Had I thought the danger so imminent, I should have\r\ndeemed it prudent to take a position somewhat further off. The mass\r\nwhich supported us had doubtless been shaken a thousand times, and was\r\nliable every hour to be shaken again; but being in the short curvature\r\nof the crater, like the key-stone of an arch, it could not easily be\r\nthrown from its position by any agitation that would naturally occur\r\nwhile this great safety-valve is kept open, or the numerous fissures\r\nround it, reaching to the very bowels of the mountain, convey harmlessly\r\nfrom unknown depths, gases and volumes of steam, generated where water\r\ncomes in contact with intense volcanic heat. Our position was about four\r\nthousand feet above the level of the sea, and one thousand above the\r\nsurface of the lake below us.\r\n\r\n“The great extent of the surface of this lava lake; the numerous places\r\nin it where the fiery element was displaying itself; the conical mouths\r\nhere and there discharging glowing lava overflowing and spreading its\r\nwaves around, or belched out in detached and molten masses that were\r\nshot forth with detonations, perhaps by the force of gases struggling\r\nthrough from below the surface, while the vast column of vapor and smoke\r\nascended up toward heaven, and the coruscations of the emitted brilliant\r\nlava, illuminating the clouds that passed over the terrific gulf, all\r\npresented by night a splendid and sublime panorama of volcanic action,\r\nprobably nowhere surpassed, if ever equaled, and which to be imagined\r\nmust be seen. Had Vulcan employed ten thousand giant Cyclops, each with\r\na steam-engine of a thousand horse-power, blowing anthracite coal for\r\nsmelting mountain minerals, or heaving up and hammering to pieces the\r\neverlasting rocks and hills, their united efforts would but begin to\r\ncompare with the work of Pele here.\r\n\r\n“There was enough of mystery connected with the wonderful experiments\r\ngoing on before our eyes, to give ample employment to fancy and\r\nphilosophy, and materially to enhance the sublimity of the fearful\r\nscene. For it might be asked, how can such an immense mass of rocks and\r\nearth be kept incessantly in a state of fusion without fuel or\r\ncombustion? Or by what process could such solid masses be fused at all,\r\nin accordance with any mode of generating heat with which we are\r\nacquainted? If there be combustion in the crater adequate to the melting\r\nof such vast masses of substances so hard, rocky and earthy, why is\r\nthere an accumulation and increase of the general mass, so that millions\r\nof cubic fathoms are, from time to time, added to the solid contents of\r\nthe mountain? But if the bowels of the mountain are supposed to be\r\nmelted by intense heat in some way generated, could they be heaved up by\r\nthe expansion of steam or gas, while an orifice equal to three or four\r\nsquare miles, like that of Kilauea, or the terminal crater on the same\r\nmountain, is kept open; for steam and gas might be supposed to pass\r\nthrough the fluid masses and escape, instead of raising them from a\r\ndepth, just as steam issues from the bottom of a boiling caldron,\r\nwithout materially elevating the surface of its contents.\r\n\r\n“But if with one class of geologists, we suppose the interior of the\r\nearth to be in a molten and fluid state, as perhaps originally created,\r\nand that Kilauea and other volcanoes are but the openings and\r\nsafety-valves of that subterranean, fiery, central ocean of red or\r\nwhite-hot matter, then we have here no faint illustration of the bold\r\nimagery used by the sacred writers, and of their phraseology, which to\r\nsome seems hyperbolical and even paradoxical, as when they speak of the\r\n‘bottomless pit,’ the ‘fire that is not quenched,’ ‘the lake that\r\nburneth with fire and brimstone,’ ‘the smoke of their torment which\r\nascendeth up forever and ever.’ If such a vast mass of fiery fluid\r\nconstitutes the main portion of the interior of the earth, it is\r\nliterally ‘bottomless;’ and the opened surface, like that of Kilauea,\r\nmay be strictly called a ‘lake of fire;’ and as sulphur and particles of\r\nthe sulphuret of iron are present, it may well be called ‘a lake that\r\nburns with fire and brimstone.’\r\n\r\n“After gazing at the wonderful and wonderfully sublime scene for some\r\ntwenty hours, taking but a little time for repose, we found the sense of\r\nfear subsiding, and curiosity prompting to a closer intercourse with\r\nPele, and a more familiar acquaintance with her doings and habits. Many\r\nwho try the experiment, though at first appalled, are ready after a few\r\nhours, to wend their way down the steep sides of the crater. Thus we\r\ndescended into the immense pit from the north-east side, where it was\r\npracticable, first to the black ledge or amphitheater gallery, and\r\nthence to the surface of the lava lake. This we found extremely\r\nirregular, presenting cones, mounds, plains, vast bridges of lava\r\nrecently cooled, pits and caverns, and portions of considerable extent\r\nin a movable and agitated state. We walked over lava which, by some\r\nprocess, had been fractured into immensely large slabs, as though it had\r\nbeen contracted by cooling, or been heaved up irregularly by the\r\nsemi-fluid mass below. In the fissures of this fractured lava, the slabs\r\nor blocks two feet below the surface, were red-hot. A walking-stick\r\nthrust down would be set on fire and flame instantly.\r\n\r\n“Passing over many masses of such lava, we ventured toward the more\r\ncentral part of the lake, and came near to a recent mound which had\r\nprobably been raised on the cooling surface, after our arrival the day\r\nbefore. From the top of it flowed melted lava, which spread itself in\r\nwaves to a considerable distance, one side or the other, all around. The\r\nmasses thrown out in succession moved sluggishly, and as they flowed\r\ndown the inclined plane, a crust was formed over them, which darkened\r\nand hardened, and became stationary, while the stream still moved on\r\nbelow it. The front of the mass, red-hot, passed along down, widening\r\nand expanding itself, and forcing its way through a net-work, as it\r\nwere, of irregular filaments of iron, which the cooling process freely\r\nsupplied. This motion of a flowing mass, whether smaller or larger, seen\r\nfrom the rim of the crater by night, gives the appearance of a fiery\r\nsurf, or a rolling wave of fire, or the dancing along of an extended\r\nsemicircular flame on the surface of the lake. When one wave has\r\nexpended itself, or found its level, or otherwise become stationary,\r\nanother succeeds and passes over it in like manner, and then another,\r\nsent out as it were, by the pulsations of the earth’s open artery, at\r\nthe top of the mound. This shows how a mound, cone, pyramid, or\r\nmountain, can be gradually built of lava, and wide plains covered at its\r\nbase with the same material.\r\n\r\n“We approached near the border of some of these waves, and reached the\r\nmelted lava with a stick two yards long; and thus obtained several\r\nspecimens red-hot from the flowing mass. I have since had occasion to be\r\nsurprised at the absence of fear in this close contiguity with the\r\nterrible element, where the heat under our feet was as great as our\r\nshoes would bear, and the radiating heat from the moving mass was so\r\nintense that I could face it only a few seconds at a time at a distance\r\nof two or three yards. Yet having carefully observed its movements\r\nawhile, I threw a stick of wood upon the thin crust of a moving wave\r\nwhere I believed it would bear me, even if it should bend a little, and\r\nstood upon it a few moments. In that position, thrusting my cane down\r\nthrough the cooling, tough crust, about half an inch thick, I withdrew\r\nit, and forthwith there gushed up of the melted, flowing lava under my\r\nfeet, enough to form a globular mass two and a half or three inches in\r\ndiameter, which, as it cooled, I broke off and bore away as spoils from\r\nthe ancient domain and favorite seat of the great idol goddess of the\r\nHawaiians. Parts that were in violent action we dared not approach.\r\n\r\n“There is a remarkable variety in the volcanic productions of Hawaii; a\r\nvariety as to texture, form and size, from the vast mountain and\r\nextended plain, to the fine-drawn and most delicate vitreous fiber, the\r\nrough clinker, the smooth stream, the basaltic rock, and masses compact\r\nand hard as granite or flint, and the pumice or porous scoriæ, or\r\ncinders, which, when hot, probably formed a scum or foam on the surface\r\nof the denser molten mass. Considerable quantities of capillary glass\r\nare produced at Kilauea, though I am not aware that the article is found\r\nelsewhere on the islands. Its production has been deemed mysterious. In\r\nits appearance it resembles human hair, and among the natives is\r\nfamiliarly called ‘=Lauoho o Pele=,’ the hair of Pele. It is formed, I\r\npresume, by the tossing off of small detached portions of lava of the\r\nconsistence of melted glass, from the mouths of cones, when a fine\r\nvitreous thread is drawn out between the moving portion, and that from\r\nwhich it is detached. The fine-spun product is then blown about by the\r\nwind, both within and around the crater, and is collected in little\r\nlocks or tufts.\r\n\r\n“Sulphur is seen, but in small quantities, in and around the crater; and\r\nat a little distance from the rim there are yellow banks, on which\r\nbeautiful crystals of sulphur may be found. In one place, a pool of pure\r\ndistilled water, condensed from the steam that rises from a deep\r\nfissure, affords the thirsty traveler a beverage far better than that of\r\nthe ordinary distiller. There is, however, a kind of sulphurous gas\r\nproduced by the volcano, which is highly deleterious if breathed often\r\nor freely. This is one source of danger to the visitor, which, while I\r\nwas down a thousand feet below the rim, produced a temporary coughing.\r\n\r\n“I was, perhaps, too venturesome, but other visitors have been far more\r\nso. As one instance of this, Dr. Judd, having become familiar with the\r\nvolcanic power, in his ardor to secure valuable and recent specimens for\r\nthe United States exploring expedition, on the visit of Commodore Wilkes\r\nand his company to this crater, descended to the surface of the lake,\r\nand then into a _sub-crater_ in the midst of the larger. While he was\r\nbusily engaged there in collecting specimens, a sudden bursting up of a\r\nhuge volume of fluid lava from the bottom of the sub-crater, alarmed\r\nhim, and threatened speedily to overwhelm and destroy him. He sprang to\r\nescape, but finding the rim overhanging, he could not scale it where he\r\nwas; and the flowing mass was now too near to allow him to return to the\r\nplace where he had descended; and its radiating heat was too intense to\r\nbe faced. Escape without assistance was utterly hopeless; and the\r\nnatives of the company who were about the brink, and from whom such help\r\nmight have been expected, alarmed for themselves, were flying for their\r\nlives. Dr. Judd, giving himself up for lost, offered a prayer to heaven,\r\nand was about to resign himself to his fate, when a friendly and\r\nresolute Hawaiian, who had been a pupil at the mission seminary,\r\ncompassionating the exposed sufferer, faced the approaching fiery\r\nvolume, and braving its intense heat, exposed his own life, reached down\r\nhis strong hand, and firmly grasped the doctor’s, who thus, at the last\r\navailable moment, through their united exertions and the blessing of\r\nheaven, escaped with his life from the horrible pit and a fiery grave! A\r\nmighty current instantly overflowed the place where they had just been\r\nstanding, and they were obliged to run for their lives before the molten\r\nflood; and being able to outstrip it, they ascended from the surface of\r\nthe abyss to the lofty rim, with heartfelt thanksgivings to their great\r\ndeliverer.[1] This proves the real danger of descending too far into the\r\ncrater of the volcano; and had it occurred in the days of unbroken\r\nsuperstition, it would doubtless have been ascribed to the anger of\r\nPele, and tended to increase the number of her deluded worshipers. But\r\nnow such a deliverance was justly ascribed to the kind providence of\r\nJehovah, the knowledge of whose character, as displayed in the gospel,\r\nhas introduced the Hawaiian race into a new life.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1:\r\n\r\n  See United States Exploring Expedition, vol. iv., p. 173.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n“Kilauea may be regarded as one of the safety-valves of a bottomless\r\nreservoir of melted earth, below the cooled and cooling crust on which\r\nmountains rise, rivers flow, oceans roll, and cities are multiplied as\r\nthe habitations of men. It has been kept open from time immemorial,\r\nalways displaying more or less of its active power. The circumambient\r\nair which carries off the caloric, sometimes aided by rain, is\r\nincessantly endeavoring to shut up this valve, or bridge over this\r\norifice of three or four square miles of the fiery abyss. Sometimes the\r\nimperfect bridge of cooling lava is pierced with fifty or sixty large,\r\nrough, conical chimneys, emitting gas, smoke, flame, and lava; and\r\nsometimes the vast bridge is broken up, and all these cones submerged\r\nand probably fused again by the intense heat of the vast fluid mass\r\nsupplied fresh from the interior. The mass rises gradually higher and\r\nhigher, hundreds of feet, till by its immense pressure against the sides\r\nof the crater, aided, perhaps, by the power of gas or steam, it forces a\r\npassage for miles through the massive walls, and inundates with its\r\nfiery deluge some portion of the country below, or passing through it,\r\nas a river of fire, pours itself into the sea at the distance of\r\ntwenty-five miles, thus disturbing with awful uproar the domains of old\r\nNeptune, and enlarging the dominions of the Hawaiian sovereign.\r\n\r\n“The whole island, with its ample and towering mountains, is often\r\nshaken with awful throes, and creation here ‘groaneth and travaileth in\r\npain.’ In July, 1840, a river of lava flowed out from Kilauea, and\r\npassing some miles under ground, burst out in the district of Puna, and\r\ninundated a portion of the country, sweeping down forests, carrying\r\neverything in its way before it, and as a river a mile wide, falling\r\ninto the sea, and heating the waters of the ocean, making war upon its\r\ninhabitants, and by the united action of this volcanic flood and the\r\nsea, formed several huge, rough hills of sand and lava along the shore.\r\nAnd still later than the above date, a similar flood has been poured\r\nfrom the summit of Mauna Loa, flowing with terrific force for weeks, and\r\nthus elevating a portion of the region between Mauna Loa and Mauna Kea;\r\nand so extensive and splendid was this exhibition, that it could be seen\r\nfrom the missionary station at Hilo, a distance of about forty miles.\r\n\r\n“After having spent some thirty hours on this king of all the volcanoes,\r\nwe set out to return. And on our journey we passed over several large\r\ntracts of lava of different kinds, some smooth, vitreous and shining,\r\nsome twisted and coiled like huge ropes, and some consisting of sharp,\r\nirregular, loose, rugged volcanic masses, of every form and size, from\r\nan ounce in weight to several tuns, thrown, I could not conceive how,\r\ninto a chaos or field of the roughest surface, presenting a forbidding\r\narea of from one to forty square miles in extent; and though not\r\nprecipitous, yet so horrid as to forbid a path, and to defy the approach\r\nof horses and cattle. In the crevices of the more solid lava are found\r\nthe _ohelo_, which somewhat resembles the whortleberry, nourished by\r\nfrequent showers and dew. At ten o’clock we halted for breakfast, and by\r\nthe time the sun was setting had reached Waimea, thus completing our\r\nexcursion to this vast volcano, which is truly _one of the wonders of\r\nthe world_!”\r\n\r\n                        THE PEAK OF DERBYSHIRE.\r\n\r\nThis peak consists of a chain of high mountains in the county of Derby,\r\nin England, and has been long celebrated, as well on account of its\r\nmineral productions, and natural curiosities in general, as of what are\r\ncalled its seven wonders. Six of these are natural, namely, Poole’s\r\nHole, Elden Hole, the Peak Cavern, or the Devil’s Hole, Mam Tor, St.\r\nAnn’s Well, and the Ebbing and Flowing Well. Having described these, we\r\nshall add a more recent discovery, that of the Crystallized Cavern,\r\nwhich possesses an equal interest.\r\n\r\nPoole’s Hole, lying about a mile to the westward of Buxton, is a vast\r\ncavern formed by nature in the limestone rock, and was, according to\r\ntradition, the residence of an outlaw, named Poole. The entrance is low\r\nand contracted, and the passage narrow; but this widening, at length,\r\nleads to a lofty and spacious cavern, from the roof of which stalactites\r\nor transparent crystals, formed by the constant dropping of water laden\r\nwith calcareous matter, hang in spiral masses. Other portions of these\r\npetrifactions drop and attach themselves to the floor, rising in cones,\r\nand become what are termed stalagmites.\r\n\r\nOne of the dropping stalactites, of an immense size, called the Flitch\r\nof Bacon, occurs about the middle of the cavern, which here becomes very\r\nnarrow, but soon spreads to a greater width, and continues large and\r\nlofty until the visitor reaches another surprisingly large mass of\r\nstalactite, to which the name of Mary Queen of Scots’ Pillar is given,\r\nfrom the tradition that this unfortunate queen once paid a visit to the\r\ncavern, and proceeded thus far into its recesses. As this pillar can not\r\nbe passed without some difficulty, few persons venture beyond it; nor\r\ndoes it seem desirable, as, by proceeding thus far, a very competent\r\nidea of the cavern may be formed. The path hitherto is along the side,\r\nand at some hight from the bottom of the cavern; but to visit and\r\nexamine the interior extremity, it becomes necessary to descend a few\r\nyards by very slippery and ill-formed steps. The path at the bottom is\r\ntolerably even and level for about sixty feet, when an almost\r\nperpendicular ascent commences, which leads to the extremity of the\r\nfissure, through the eye of St. Anthony’s Needle, a narrow strait,\r\nbeyond which the steepness of the way is only to be surmounted by\r\nclambering over irregular masses of rock. The cavern terminates nearly\r\nthree hundred feet beyond the Queen of Scots’ pillar. Toward the end is\r\nan aperture through a projecting rock, behind which a candle is\r\ngenerally placed, when any person has reached the extremity: when seen\r\nat that distance, it appears like a dim star. The visitor returns along\r\nthe bottom of the cavern, beneath a considerable portion of the road by\r\nwhich he entered; and, by thus changing the path, has an opportunity\r\nbetter to ascertain the hight and width of the cavern in every part, and\r\nto view other accumulated petrifactions, some of which are of a\r\nprodigious size, and of an extraordinary form. In one part of this\r\npassage is a fine spring of transparent water; and a small stream, which\r\nbecomes more considerable in rainy seasons, runs through the whole\r\nlength of the cavern. Its sound, in passing through this spacious and\r\nlofty concavity, which resembles the interior of a Gothic cathedral, has\r\na fine effect. To the right, in a small cavern called Poole’s chamber,\r\nis a curious echo.\r\n\r\nThe various masses of stalactical matter which are everywhere met with\r\nin this natural excavation, and which reflect innumerable rays from the\r\nlights carried by guides, are distinguished by the names of the objects\r\nthey are fancied most to resemble. Thus we have Poole’s saddle, his\r\nturtle, and his woolsack; the lion, the lady’s toilet, the pillion, the\r\nbee-hive, &c. It should be noticed, however, that the forms are\r\nconstantly varied by the percolation of the water through the roof and\r\nsides of the rock. The subterraneous passage is nearly a half a mile in\r\nlength.\r\n\r\n                              ELDEN HOLE.\r\n\r\nElden Hole is situated on the side of a gentle hill about a mile to the\r\nnorth-west of the village of Peak Forest. It is a deep chasm in the\r\nground, surrounded by a wall, of uncemented stones, to prevent\r\naccidents. This fissure or cleft in the rock has been the subject of\r\nmany exaggerated descriptions and superstitious reports, having been\r\nrepresented not only as unfathomable, but as teeming, at a certain\r\ndepth, with so impure an air, that it could not be respired without\r\nimmediate destruction. Mr. Lloyd, however, who descended it about\r\nseventy years ago, has proved the absurdity of these relations, in a\r\npaper, of which the following is a brief abstract, published in the\r\nPhilosophical Transactions.\r\n\r\nFor the first sixty feet, he observes, he descended somewhat obliquely,\r\nthe passage then becoming difficult from projecting crags. At the\r\nfurther depth of thirty feet, the inflection of his rope varied at least\r\neighteen feet from the perpendicular. The breadth of the chink was here\r\nabout nine feet, and the length eighteen; the sides being irregular,\r\nmoss-grown, and wet. Within forty-two feet of the bottom, the rock\r\nopened on the east, and he swung till he reached the floor of a cave,\r\none hundred and eighty-six feet only from the mouth, the light from\r\nwhich was sufficiently strong to permit the reading of any book. The\r\ninterior of the chasm he describes as consisting of two parts, which\r\ncommunicate with each other by a small arched passage, the one\r\nresembling an oven, the other the dome of a glass-house. On the south\r\nside of the latter, was a small opening, about twelve feet in length,\r\nand four feet in hight, lined throughout with a kind of sparkling\r\nstalactite, of a fine deep yellow color, with petrifying drops hanging\r\nfrom the roof. Tracing the entrance he found a noble column, above\r\nninety feet high, of the same kind of incrustation. As he proceeded to\r\nthe north, he came to a large stone which was covered with the same\r\nsubstance; and beneath it he found a hole six feet in depth, uniformly\r\nlined with it. From the edge of this hole sprung up a rocky ascent,\r\nsloping, like a buttress, against the side of the cavern, and consisting\r\nof vast, solid, round masses of the same substance and color. Having\r\nclimbed this ascent to the hight of about sixty feet, he obtained some\r\nfine pieces of stalactite, which hung from the craggy sides of the\r\ncavern. Descending with some difficulty and danger, he proceeded in the\r\nsame direction, and soon came to another pile of incrustations of a\r\nbrown color, above which he found a small cavern, opening into the side\r\nof the vault, which he now entered. Here he saw vast masses of\r\nstalactite, hanging like icicles from every part of the roof: several of\r\nthese were four and five feet long, and thick as a man’s body. The sides\r\nof the largest cavern were chiefly lined with incrustations of three\r\nkinds, the first of which was a deep yellow stalactite; the second, a\r\nthin coating which resembled a pale stone-color varnish, and reflected\r\nthe light of the candle with great splendor; and the third, a rough\r\nefflorescence, the shoot of which resembled a rose flower.\r\n\r\nSome more recent visitors have thus stated the result of their\r\nobservations and inquiries relative to Elden Hole. They describe the\r\nmouth of this chasm as opening horizontally, in a direction from north\r\nto south; its shape being nearly that of an irregular ellipse, about\r\nninety feet in length, and twenty-seven in breadth at the widest part.\r\nThe northern end is fringed with small trees; and moss and underwood\r\ngrow out of the crevices on each side, to the depth of forty or fifty\r\nfeet. As the fissure recedes from the surface, it gradually contracts;\r\nand at the depth of about seventy feet inclines considerably to the\r\nwest, so as to prevent its course from being further traced.\r\nNotwithstanding the obstacles of the bushes and projecting masses of\r\nstone, it was sounded, and its depth found not to exceed two hundred and\r\ntwo feet, an estimate which corresponds with the assertion of three\r\nminers, who had descended in search of the bodies of individuals who\r\nwere missing, and were supposed to have been robbed, murdered, and\r\nthrown into this frightful abyss.\r\n\r\n                              PEAK CAVERN.\r\n\r\nPeak cavern, also called the Devil’s Hole, is one of those magnificent,\r\nsublime, and extraordinary productions of nature, which constantly\r\nexcite the wonder and admiration of their beholders. It has accordingly\r\nbeen considered one of the principal wonders of Derbyshire, and has been\r\ncelebrated by several poets. It lies in the vicinity of Castleton, and\r\nis approached by a path at the side of a clear rivulet, leading to the\r\nfissure, or separation of the rock, at the extremity of which the cavern\r\nis situated. It would be difficult to imagine a scene more august than\r\nthat which presents itself to the visitor at its entrance: on each side,\r\nthe huge gray rocks rise almost perpendicularly, to the hight of nearly\r\nthree hundred feet, or about seven times the hight of a modern house,\r\nand meeting each other at right or cross angles, form a deep gloomy\r\nrecess. In front, it is overhung by a vast canopy of rock, assuming the\r\nappearance of a depressed arch, and extending, in width, one hundred and\r\ntwenty feet, in hight forty-two, and in receding depth about ninety.\r\nAfter penetrating about ninety feet into the cavern, the roof becomes\r\nlower, and a gentle descent leads, by a detached rock, to the interior\r\nentrance of this tremendous hollow. Here the light of day, having\r\ngradually diminished, wholly disappears; and the visitor is provided\r\nwith a torch to illumine his further progress.\r\n\r\nThe progress now becoming extremely confined, he is obliged to proceed,\r\nin a stooping posture, about twenty yards, when he reaches a spacious\r\nopening, named the Bellhouse, and is thence led to a small lake, called\r\nthe First Water, about forty feet in length, but not more than two or\r\nthree feet in depth. Over this he is conveyed in a boat to the interior\r\nof the cavern, beneath a massive vault of rock, which in some parts\r\ndescends to within eighteen or twenty inches of the water. “We stood\r\nsome time,” says M. de St. Fond, “on the brink of this lake; and the\r\nlight of our dismal torches, which emitted a black smoke, reflecting our\r\npale images from its bottom, we almost conceived we saw a troop of\r\nspecters starting from an abyss to welcome us. The illusion was\r\nextremely striking.”\r\n\r\nOn landing, the visitor enters a spacious vacuity, two hundred and\r\ntwenty feet in length, two hundred feet in breadth, and in some parts\r\none hundred and twenty feet in hight, opening into the bosom of the\r\nrock; but, from the want of light, neither the distant sides nor the\r\nroof of this abyss, can be seen. In a passage at the inner extremity of\r\nthis vast cave, the stream which flows through the whole length of the\r\ncavern, spreads into what is called the Second Water, and near its\r\ntermination is a projecting pile of rocks, known by the appellation of\r\nRoger Rain’s House, from the incessant fall of water in large drops\r\nthrough the crevices of the roofs. Beyond this, opens another tremendous\r\nhollow, called the Chancel, where the rocks are much broken, and the\r\nsides covered with stalactical or petrified incrustations. Here the\r\nvisitor is surprised by a vocal concert which bursts in discordant tones\r\nfrom the upper regions of the chasm. “Still,” observes a tourist, “this\r\nbeing unexpected, and issuing from a quarter where no object can be\r\nseen, in a place where all else is still as death, is calculated to\r\nimpress the imagination with solemn ideas, and can seldom be heard\r\nwithout that emotion of awe and pleasure, astonishment and delight,\r\nwhich is one of the most interesting feelings of the mind.” At the\r\nconclusion of the strain, the choristers, who consist of eight or ten\r\nwomen and children, are seen ranged in the hollow of the rock, about\r\nfifty feet above the floor.\r\n\r\nThe path now leads to a place whimsically called the Devil’s Cellar and\r\nHalf-way House, and thence, by three natural and regular arches, to a\r\nvast concavity, which, from its uniform bell-like appearance, is called\r\nGreat Tom of Lincoln. When illuminated by a strong light, this concavity\r\nhas a very pleasing effect; the symmetrical disposition of the rocks,\r\nthe stream flowing beneath, and the spiracles in the roof, forming a\r\nvery interesting picture. From this point the vault gradually descends,\r\nthe passage contracts, and at length does not leave more than sufficient\r\nroom for the current of the stream, which continues to flow through a\r\nsubterraneous channel of several miles in extent, as is proved by the\r\nsmall stones brought into it after great rains, from the distant mines\r\nof the Peak Forest.\r\n\r\nThe entire length of this wonderful cavern is twenty-two hundred and\r\nfifty feet, or nearly half a mile; and its depth, from the surface of\r\nthe Peak mountain, about six hundred and twenty feet. A curious effect\r\nis produced by the explosion of a small quantity of gunpowder, wedged\r\ninto the rock in the interior of the cavern; for the sound appears to\r\nroll along the roof and sides, like a tremendous and continued peal of\r\nthunder. The effect of the light, on returning from these dark recesses,\r\nis particularly impressive; and the gradual illumination of the rocks,\r\nwhich becomes brighter as the entrance is approached, is said to exhibit\r\none of the most interesting scenes that ever employed the pencil of an\r\nartist, or fixed the admiration of a spectator.\r\n\r\n                                MAM TOR.\r\n\r\nMam Tor or the Shivering Mountain, is a huge precipice facing the east\r\nor south-east, chiefly composed of a peculiar kind of slate, which,\r\nalthough very hard before it is exposed to the air, very easily crumbles\r\nto dust on such exposure. Hence it is perpetually wasted by the action\r\nof the rain and snow; while the harder and larger masses of stone being\r\nthus loosened and disengaged, necessarily fall from their positions, and\r\nthis with a rushing noise which is occasionally so loud as to be heard\r\nat Castleton, a distance of two miles. The valley beneath is overwhelmed\r\nwith their fragments to the extent of half a mile. In many parts of the\r\nprecipice, they produce, before their descent, a cavernous appearance,\r\nand even a romantic overhanging scenery, highly dangerous to be\r\napproached. It is affirmed by the most intelligent of the neighboring\r\ninhabitants, that this mountain chiefly wastes during violent storms of\r\nsnow and rain; and Mr. Martin, who published an account of Mam Tor, in\r\nthe Philosophical Transactions for 1729, affirms that the decay is not\r\nconstantly the same. He not only surveyed it closely, but ascended the\r\nsteepest part of the precipice, without tracing any other shivering in\r\nthe mountain, beside that which was occasioned by the treading of his\r\nfeet in the loose crumbled earth.\r\n\r\n                      THE EBBING AND FLOWING WELL.\r\n\r\nIn the vicinity of Chapel-en-le-Frith is a steep hill, rising to the\r\nhight of more than a hundred feet, immediately beneath which this\r\nnatural phenomenon lies. It is of an irregular form, but nearly\r\napproaching to a square, from two or three feet in depth, and about\r\ntwenty feet in width.\r\n\r\nIts ebbings and flowings are irregular, and dependent on the quantity of\r\nrain which falls in the different seasons of the year; when it begins to\r\nrise, the current can only be perceived by the slow movement of the\r\nblades of grass, or other light bodies floating on the surface;\r\nnotwithstanding which, before the expiration of a minute, the water\r\nissues with a gurgling noise, in considerable quantities, from several\r\nsmall apertures on the south and west sides. The interval of time\r\nbetween the ebbing and flowing is not always alike: consequently the\r\nproportion of water it discharges at different periods, also varies. In\r\nthe space of five minutes flowing, the water occasionally rises to the\r\nhight of six inches; and, after remaining a few seconds stationary, the\r\nwell assumes its former quiescent state.\r\n\r\nThe cause of the intermittent flowing of this well may be satisfactorily\r\nexplained, on the principle of the action of the siphon, and on the\r\nsupposition of a natural one communicating with a cavity in the hill,\r\nwhere the water may be supposed to accumulate; but for the phenomenon of\r\nits ebbing, no satisfactory reason has been assigned. The opinion of a\r\nsecond siphon, (which is ingeniously advanced by one tourist,) that\r\nbegins to act when the water rises, is inconsistent with the appearance\r\nof the well, and therefore can not be just.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            ST. ANNE’S WELL.\r\n\r\nThis well, the usual resort of the company who frequent Buxton to drink\r\nthe waters, has been classed among the wonders of the peak, on account\r\nof this singularity, that within five feet of the hot spring by which it\r\nis supplied, a cold one arises. This is not, however, the only well of\r\nthe kind, since hot and cold springs rise near each other in many parts\r\nof England, and in other countries. The water is conveyed to the well,\r\nwhich is an elegant classical building, in the Grecian style, from the\r\noriginal spring, by a narrow passage, so close and well contrived as to\r\nprevent it from losing any considerable portion of its heat, and is\r\nreceived in a white marble bason. It is not so warm as the Bath water,\r\nits temperature being about eighty degrees of Fahrenheit.\r\n\r\n                        THE CRYSTALLIZED CAVERN.\r\n\r\nThe crystallized cavern, the new wonder of the Derbyshire Peak, was\r\ndiscovered some years ago in the vicinity of the village of Bradwell. We\r\nextract the following particulars of this singular and beautiful natural\r\nexcavation, from Hutchinson’s tour in the High Peak.\r\n\r\nThe entrance is rather terrific than grand; and the descent, for about\r\nthirty paces, very abrupt. The visitor has then to pass along the\r\ninclined way for nearly a quarter of a mile, the opening being so low\r\nthat it is impossible to proceed, in particular parts, in an erect\r\nposture. The different crystallizations which now attract his attention\r\non every side, soon make him forget the irksomeness of the road, and\r\nbanish every idea of fatigue. New objects of curiosity crowd one on the\r\nother. In a place called the Music Chamber, the petrifactions take the\r\nsemblance of the pipes of an organ; while in other parts, these\r\nstalactites are formed into elegant small colonnades, with as exact a\r\nsymmetry as if they had been chiseled by the most skillful artist.\r\nCandles judiciously disposed within them, give an idea of the imaginary\r\npalaces of fairies, or of sylphs and genii, who have chosen this for\r\ntheir magnificent abode.\r\n\r\nStill he has seen nothing comparable to what he is now to expect; for,\r\nat the distance of about a hundred paces further, by a rugged descent,\r\nhe enters what is called the Grotto of Paradise. This heavenly spot, for\r\nit can not be compared to anything terrestrial, is, of itself, a\r\nbeautiful crystallized cavern, about twelve feet high, and in length\r\ntwenty feet, pointed at the top, similar to a Gothic arch, with a\r\ncountless number of large stalactites hanging from the roof. Candles\r\nplaced among them give some idea of its being lighted up with elegant\r\nglass chandeliers; while the sides are entirely incrusted, and brilliant\r\nin the extreme. The floor is checkered with black and white spar. It\r\nhas, altogether, a most novel and elegant appearance. This glittering\r\napartment would be left by the visitor with a certain degree of regret,\r\ndid he not expect to see it again on his return.\r\n\r\nStill continuing a route similar to the one he has passed, in the course\r\nof which his attention is occasionally arrested by the curiosities of\r\nthe place, and by the gentle droppings of the water, which scarcely\r\nbreak the solemn silence of the scene, he at length reaches the Grotto\r\nof Calypso, and the extremity of the cavern, upward of two thousand feet\r\nfrom the entrance. To see this grotto to advantage, he has to ascend\r\nabout six feet, into a recess. There, the beautiful appearance of the\r\ndifferent crystallizations, some of them of an azure cast, and the\r\nechoes reverberating from side to side, make him fancy he has reached\r\nthe secluded retreat of some mythological deity.\r\n\r\nReturning by the same path for a considerable distance, another cavern,\r\nwhich branches in a south-west direction from the one already explored,\r\npresents itself. The roads here are still more difficult of access, but\r\nthe stalactites are certainly most beautiful. Many of them, more than a\r\nyard in length, are pendent from the roof, and the greater part do not\r\nexceed the dimension of the smallest reed. The top and sides of this\r\ncavern are remarkably smooth, particularly at the part called the\r\nAmphitheater. In general, the stone is of a very dark color, to which\r\nthe transparent appearances before mentioned, with each a drop of water\r\nhanging at its extremity, form a fine contrast.\r\n\r\n                            SPEEDWELL LEVEL.\r\n\r\nIn the Speedwell Level, or Navigation Mine, in the vicinity of\r\nCastleton, art has been combined with the subterraneous wonders of\r\nnature. Being provided with lights, the guide leads the visitor beneath\r\nan arched vault, by a flight of one hundred and six steps, to the sough\r\nor level, where a boat is ready for his reception, and is put in motion\r\nby pushing against pegs driven into the wall for that purpose. After\r\nproceeding about one-third of a mile through various caverns, the level\r\nbursts into a tremendous gulf, the roof and bottom of which are\r\ninvisible, but across which the navigation has been carried, by throwing\r\na strong arch over a part of the fissure where the rocks are least\r\nseparated. Here, leaving the boat, and ascending a stage erected above\r\nthe level, the attention of the visitor is directed to the dark recess\r\nof the abyss beneath his feet; and firm indeed must be his resolution,\r\nif he can contemplate the scene unmoved, and without an involuntary\r\nshudder. To the depth of ninety feet all is vacuity and gloom; but\r\nbeyond that commences a pool of Stygian waters, not unaptly named the\r\nBottomless Pit, the prodigious range of which may in some measure be\r\nconceived, by the circumstance of its having swallowed up more than\r\nforty thousand tuns of rubbish, made in blasting the rock, without any\r\napparent diminution either of its depth or extent. The guides assert\r\nthat the former has not been ascertained; but there is reason to believe\r\nthat its actual depth in standing water is about three hundred and\r\ntwenty feet. There can not, however, be a doubt but that this abyss has\r\ncommunications with others still more deeply situated in the bowels of\r\nthe mountain, and into which the precipitated rubbish has found a\r\npassage. The superfluous water of the level falls through a water-gate\r\ninto this profound caldron, with a noise like a rushing torrent.\r\n\r\nThis fissure is calculated to be about eight hundred feet beneath the\r\nsurface of the mountain; and so great is its reach upward, that rockets\r\nof sufficient strength to ascend four hundred and fifty feet, have been\r\nfired without rendering the roof visible. The effect of a Bengal light\r\ndischarged in this stupendous cavity, is extremely magnificent and\r\ninteresting.\r\n\r\n                             THE HIGH TOR.\r\n\r\nThis is one of the many sublime objects presented by Matlock dale, the\r\nbeauties of which will be cursorily described, in proportion as these\r\nobjects pass under our review.\r\n\r\nIn approaching the bath, which is nearly a mile to the south-west of the\r\nvillage of Matlock, a specimen of the scenery by which this charming\r\nvale is distinguished, presents itself. The entrance is through a rock,\r\nwhich has been blasted for the purpose of opening a convenient passage;\r\nand here a scene which blends the constituent principles of the\r\npicturesque, the beautiful and the sublime, opens suddenly on the view.\r\nThrough the middle of a narrow plain flows the Derwent, overhung by a\r\nprofusion of luxuriant beeches and other drooping trees. Toward the east\r\nare gently rising grounds, and on the west the huge mural banks of the\r\nvale stretch along, the white face of the rock of which they are\r\ncomposed occasionally displaying itself through the woody clothing of\r\ntheir sides and summits. This magnificent scenery is singularly\r\ncontrasted by the manufactories and lodging-houses at the bottom of the\r\nvale.\r\n\r\nTo see this magic spot to the greatest advantage, it should be entered\r\nat its northern extremity, its beauties then succeeding each other in a\r\nproper gradation, and their grandeur and effect being rendered more\r\nimpressive. The chief attention is now attracted to the High Tor, a\r\ngrand and stupendous rock, which appears like a vast abrupt wall of\r\nlimestone, and rises almost perpendicularly from the river, to the hight\r\nof upward of three hundred and fifty feet. The lower part of this\r\nmajestic feature is shaded by yew-trees, elms, limes, and underwood of\r\nvarious foliage; but the upper part, for fifty or sixty yards, presents\r\na rugged front of one broad mass of perpendicular rock. From its summit\r\nthe vale is seen in all its grandeur, diversified by woods of various\r\nhues and species. The windings of the Derwent, the grayish-colored\r\nrocks, and the white fronts of the houses, embosomed amid groves of\r\ntrees which sprout from every crevice of the precipices, give variety\r\nand animation to a scene of wonderful beauty.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BRIDGE OVER THE WYE.]\r\n\r\n                               CHEE TOR.\r\n\r\nIn a romantic and deep hollow, near the little village of Wormhill, the\r\nriver Wye flows beneath this stupendous mass of rock, which rises\r\nperpendicularly more than three hundred and sixty feet above its level.\r\nThe channel of the river, which meanders at the base, is confined\r\nbetween huge rocks of limestone, having such a general correspondence of\r\nsituation and form, as to render it probable that they were once united.\r\nIn some parts they are partially covered with brushwood, nut-trees and\r\nmountain-ash; while in others, they are totally naked, precipitous and\r\nimpending. The chasm runs in a direction so nearly circular, that the\r\nsublime Chee Tor, and its dependent masses of rock, are almost insulated\r\nby the river which rolls at their feet. Its length, as far as it\r\npossesses any considerable beauty, is between five and six hundred\r\nyards; a distance which presents several picturesque and interesting\r\nviews, the general effect of the fine scenery being enhanced by the\r\nplantations on the neighboring hights, and by a spring which flows into\r\nthe river near the bottom of a deep descent, as well as by a romantic\r\nbridge over the river itself, a representation of which may be seen in\r\nthe cut above. Not far from here is the well known Masson hill,\r\ncelebrated in Darwin’s “Loves of the Plants,” which is so high as to\r\noverlook the country to a vast extent, and compared with which even the\r\nHigh Tor seems considerably diminished in grandeur and sublimity; but\r\nthis effect is partly compensated by the extent of the prospect, and the\r\nvariety of objects it comprehends. The hight of this eminence is about\r\nseven hundred and fifty feet, the path to its summit having been\r\ncarried, in a winding direction, through a grove. About half-way in the\r\nascent is an alcove, from which an extensive view of a great part of\r\nMatlock dale may be seen, through a fine avenue formed for that purpose.\r\n\r\n                         THE CUMBERLAND CAVERN.\r\n\r\nTo the west and north-west of the village of Matlock, are three\r\napertures in the rock, respectively named the Cumberland, Smedley, and\r\nRutland caverns. The former of these is well deserving of a short\r\nnotice.\r\n\r\nThe entrance is partly artificial, to afford a greater facility to the\r\nvisitor, who has to descend fifty-four steps. The cavern now opens on\r\nhim in solitary grandeur. Huge masses of stone are piled on each other\r\nwith a tremendous kind of carelessness, evidently produced by some\r\nviolent concussion, though at an unknown period. He is conducted to a\r\nlong and wide passage, the roof of which has all the regularity of a\r\nfinished ceiling, and is bespangled by spars of various descriptions.\r\nFrom above, from beneath, and from the sides, the rays of the lights are\r\nreflected in every direction. In an adjacent compartment, rocks are\r\nheaped on rocks in terrible array, and assume a threatening aspect. Next\r\nis an apartment decorated with what, in the language of the country, is\r\ncalled the snow-fossil, a petrifaction which, both in figure and color,\r\nresembles snow, as it is drifted by the winter storm into the cavities\r\nof a rock. Near the extremity of the cavern are to be seen fishes\r\npetrified and fixed in the several strata which form the surrounding\r\nrecess. One of these has its back jutting out of the side of the earth,\r\nas if it had been petrified in the act of swimming. In another branch of\r\nthe cavern a well has been found of a considerable depth.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            REYNARD’S HOLE.\r\n\r\nAfter having proceeded about a mile in Dove dale, the romantic and\r\nsublime beauties of which will be hereafter noticed, by a route\r\nconstantly diversified by new fantastic forms, and uncouth combinations\r\nof rock, the visitor is led to a mass of mural rock, bearing the above\r\nname, and perforated by nature into a grand arch, nearly approaching to\r\nthe shape of the sharply pointed Gothic style of architecture, about\r\nforty-five feet in hight, and in width twenty. Having passed through\r\nthis arch, a steep ascent leads to a natural cavern, called Reynard’s\r\nHall, forty-five feet in length, fifteen in breadth, and in hight\r\nthirty. From the mouth of this cavern the scenery is singular, beautiful\r\nand impressive. The face of the rock which contains the arch, rises\r\nimmediately in front, and would effectually prevent the eye from ranging\r\nbeyond its mighty barrier, did not its center open into the\r\nabove-mentioned arch, through which is seen a small part of the opposite\r\nside of the dale, consisting of a mass of gloomy wood, from the shade of\r\nwhich a huge detached rock, solitary, cragged, and pointed, starts out\r\nto a great hight, and forms an object truly sublime. This rock, which\r\nhas received the name of Dove Dale Church, is pleasingly contrasted by\r\nthe little pastoral river, Dove, and by its verdant turfy banks. A\r\nnarrow opening at the extremity of the cavern is supposed to lead to\r\nother similar cavities in the rock; and on the left is a cavern, about\r\nforty feet in length, in breadth fourteen, and in hight twenty-six,\r\ncalled Reynard’s Kitchen, from the interior of which a pleasing view is\r\npresented of the upper part of the dale, its river and rocks.\r\n\r\nAfter passing Reynard’s Hole, already described, the rocks rise more\r\nabruptly on either side, and appear in shapes more wild and irregular,\r\nbut diversified and softened by shrubs.\r\n\r\nDove dale is nearly three miles in length; but from the sinuosity of its\r\ncourse, and its projecting precipices, the views are limited. Throughout\r\nthe whole of this majestic feature of country, the river Dove flows, in\r\nthe halcyon days of summer, with soft murmurs, innocently and\r\ntransparently over its pebbly bed; but swells into rage during the\r\nwinter months. Little tufts of shrubs and underwood form islands in\r\nminiature within its bed, which enlarge and swell the other objects. The\r\nscenery of this dale is distinguished from almost every other in the\r\nunited kingdoms, by the rugged, dissimilar, and frequently grotesque and\r\nfanciful appearance of the rocks. To employ the words of a tourist here,\r\n“It is, perhaps, on the whole one of the most pleasing sceneries of the\r\nkind anywhere to be met with. It has something peculiarly\r\ncharacteristic. Its detached, perpendicular rocks stamp it with an image\r\nentirely its own, and for that reason it affords the greater pleasure.\r\nFor it is in scenery as in life. We are most struck with the peculiarity\r\nof an original character, provided there be nothing offensive\r\n\r\n                             THOR’S HOUSE.\r\n\r\n         “Where Hamps and Manifold, their cliffs among,\r\n         Each in his flinty channel winds along,\r\n         With lucid lines the dusky moor divides,\r\n         Hurrying to intermix their sister tides,\r\n         Where still their silver-bosom’d nymphs abhor\r\n         The blood-smear’d mansion of gigantic Thor—\r\n         Erst fires volcanic in the marble womb\r\n         Of cloud-wrapp’d Whetton rais’d the massy dome;\r\n         Rocks rear’d on rocks, in huge disjointed piles,\r\n         Form the tall turrets, and the lengthen’d aisles;\r\n         Broad pond’rous piers sustain the roof, and wide\r\n         Branch the vast rainbow ribs from side to side.\r\n         While from above, descends, in milky streams,\r\n         One scanty pencil of illusive beams,\r\n         Suspended crags, and gaping gulfs illumes,\r\n         And gilds the horrors of the deepen’d glooms.\r\n         Here oft the Naiads, as they chanc’d to stray\r\n         Near the dread Fane, on Thor’s returning day,\r\n         Saw from red altars streams of guiltless blood,\r\n         Stain their green reed-beds, and pollute their flood;\r\n         Heard dying babes in wicker prisons wail,\r\n         And shrieks of matrons thrill the affrighted gale;\r\n         While from dark caves infernal echoes mock,\r\n         And fiends triumphant shout from every rock!”—DARWIN.\r\n\r\nThis spacious cavern is situated about two miles above Dove dale, near\r\nthe village of Whetton; and tradition says the Druids here offered human\r\nsacrifices, inclosed in wicker idols, to Thor, the principal deity of\r\nthe Saxons and Danes, in the ages of their idolatrous worship. Beneath\r\nis an extensive and romantic common, where the rivers Hamps and Manifold\r\nsink into the earth, and rise again in Islam gardens. These rivers merit\r\na brief description. A wooden bridge has been thrown over an abyss in\r\nthe rock, out of which the river Manifold bursts with surprising force,\r\nafter having pursued a subterraneous course of five miles, from the\r\npoint where it had engulfed itself in the earth, called Weston hill. At\r\nthe further distance of twenty yards a similar phenomenon occurs; for\r\nhere another fissure of a rock presents itself, whence the river Hamps\r\nthrows its water into day. This river disappears at Leek-water Houses, a\r\nplace between Leek and Ashbourn; thus pursuing a subterraneous course of\r\nseven miles, before it again emerges into light. On their emersion, the\r\ntemperatures of the two rivers differ two degrees and a half, the Hamps\r\nbeing the coldest.\r\n\r\n                           THE LOVERS’ LEAP.\r\n\r\nThe environs of Buxton abound in romantic sites, among the most striking\r\nof which is the dale named the Lovers’ Leap, on account of a vast\r\nprecipice which forms one side of a narrow chasm, and from the summit of\r\nwhich a love-lorn female is said to have precipitated herself into the\r\nrocky gulf below. Each side of this beautiful dell is bounded by\r\nelevated rocks, the proximity of which is such, that for a considerable\r\nspace there is scarcely room for the passage of the bubbling current of\r\nthe Wye. Several of these rocks are perpendicular, and bare of\r\nvegetation; while others are covered with ivy, yew and ash-wood, with a\r\ncraggy steep occasionally starting through the verdure. A circular road,\r\nextending in circumference about three miles, passes in view of the most\r\nromantic part of this dale, and forms a very agreeable walk or ride from\r\nBuxton. At the southern extremity the scenery assumes a milder\r\ncharacter, the hollow taking the name of Mill dale, from a mill which is\r\nturned by the stream. In conjunction with a rude bridge, a mountainous\r\npath, and other rural objects, this forms a very picturesque view.\r\nAnother fine scene is presented by a lofty rock, called Swallow Tor,\r\nwhich soars over a mass of wood, the river at its base foaming and\r\nroaring over broken masses of limestone.\r\n\r\n                               THE MOORS.\r\n\r\nDerbyshire is everywhere fruitful in natural curiosities, among the most\r\nstriking of which may be reckoned the moors of Hope parish, inasmuch as\r\nthey afford an extraordinary instance of the preservation of human\r\nbodies interred in them. In the year 1674, a grazier and his female\r\nservant, in crossing these moors on their way to Ireland, were lost in\r\nthe snow, with which they were covered from January to May, and being\r\nthen discovered, the bodies were so offensive that the coroner ordered\r\nthem to be buried on the spot. After a lapse of twenty-nine years, when\r\nthe ground was opened, they were in no way changed, the color of the\r\nskin being fair and natural, and the flesh as soft as that of persons\r\nnewly dead. For twenty succeeding years they were occasionally exposed\r\nas a spectacle, but carefully covered after being viewed. They lay at\r\nthe depth of about three feet, in a moist soil or moss. The minister of\r\nHope parish was present in 1716, forty-two years after the accident, at\r\na particular inspection of these bodies. On the stockings being drawn\r\noff, the man’s legs, which had not been uncovered before, were quite\r\nfair: the flesh, when pressed by the finger, pitted a little; and the\r\njoints played freely, without the least stiffness. Such parts of the\r\nclothing as the avidity of the country people, to possess so great a\r\ncuriosity, had spared, were firm and good; and a piece of new serge,\r\nworn by the woman, did not appear to have undergone any sensible change.\r\n\r\n                       OTHER ENGLISH CURIOSITIES.\r\n\r\nHaving thus brought to a conclusion our details relative to the wonders\r\nof the peak, and the various and interesting natural curiosities there\r\nto be found, we subjoin a brief notice of several others, which have, in\r\nEngland, attracted the notice of travelers.\r\n\r\nAmong the extraordinary caverns to be found in the mountains of the\r\nnorth of England, may be reckoned Yordas cave, in the vale of Kingsland,\r\nin Yorkshire, which contains a subterraneous cascade. Whethercot cave,\r\nnot far from Ingleton, is divided by an arch of limestones, passing\r\nunder which is seen a large cascade falling from a hight of more than\r\nsixty feet. The length of this cave is about one hundred and eighty\r\nfeet, and the breadth ninety.\r\n\r\nThere are also in various parts of England many remarkable springs, of\r\nwhich some are impregnated either with salt, (as that of Droitwich, in\r\nWorcestershire,) or sulphur, (as the famous well of Wigan, in\r\nLancashire,) or bituminous matter, (as that at Pitchford, in\r\nShropshire.) Others have a petrifying quality, as that near Lutterworth,\r\nin Leicestershire, and a dropping well in the West Riding of Yorkshire.\r\nAnd, finally, some ebb and flow, as that of the peak described above,\r\nand Laywell near Torbay, whose waters rise and fall several times in an\r\nhour. To these we may add that remarkable fountain near Richard’s\r\nCastle, in Herefordshire, commonly called Bone Well, which is generally\r\nfull of small bones, like those of frogs or fishes, though often cleared\r\nout. At a cliff near Wigan, in Lancashire, is the famous burning well:\r\nthe water is cold, neither has it any smell; yet so strong a vapor of\r\nsulphur issues out with the stream, that upon applying a light to it,\r\nthe top of the water is covered with a flame, like that of burning\r\nspirits, which lasts several hours, and emits such a heat that meat may\r\nbe boiled over it.\r\n\r\n                      MOUNTAINS OF GREAT BRITAIN.\r\n\r\nThe British isles present many mountains of a bold and imposing\r\ncharacter: when contrasted, however, with those which have been already\r\ndescribed, they must be considered as comparatively diminutive.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               BEN NEVIS.\r\n\r\nThe loftiest of these mountains is Ben Nevis, in Scotland, its elevation\r\nabove the level of the sea being forty-three hundred and eighty feet, or\r\nsomewhat more than four-fifths of a mile. It terminates in a point, and\r\nelevates its rugged front far above all the neighboring mountains. It is\r\nof easy ascent; and at the perpendicular hight of fifteen hundred feet,\r\nthe vale beneath presents a very agreeable prospect, the vista being\r\nbeautified by a diversity of bushes, shrubs, and birch woods, besides\r\nmany little verdant spots. The sea and the shore are also seen.\r\n\r\nAt the summit, the view extends at once across the island, eastward\r\ntoward the German sea, and westward to the Atlantic ocean. Nature here\r\nappears on a majestic scale and the vastness of the prospect engages the\r\nwhole attention, at the same time the objects in view are of no common\r\ndimensions. Just over the opening of the sound, at the south-west corner\r\nof Mull, Colonsay rises out of the sea like a shade of mist, at the\r\ndistance of more than ninety miles. Shuna and Lismore appear like small\r\nspots of rich verdure, and, though nearly thirty miles distant, seem\r\nquite under the spectator. The low parts of Jura can not be discerned,\r\nnor any part of Isla; far less the coast of Ireland, as has been\r\nasserted. Such is, however, the wide extent of view, that it extends one\r\nhundred and seventy miles from the horizon of the sea at the Murray\r\nfrith, on the north-east, to the island of Colonsay, on the south-west.\r\n\r\nOn the north-east side of Ben Nevis is an almost perpendicular\r\nprecipice, certainly not less than fourteen hundred feet in depth;\r\nprobably more, as it appears to exceed the third part of the entire\r\nhight of the mountain. A stranger is astonished at the sight of this\r\ndreadful rock, which has a quantity of snow lodged in its bosom\r\nthroughout the whole year. The sound of a stone thrown over the cliff to\r\nthe bottom, can not be heard when it falls, so that it is impossible to\r\nascertain in that way the hight of the precipice.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                SNOWDON.\r\n\r\nThis is the loftiest of the Welch mountains, its elevation above the\r\nlevel of the sea being thirty-seven hundred and twenty feet, or nearly\r\nthree-quarters of a mile. It is accessible on one side only, its flanks\r\nbeing in every other quarter precipitous. Its aspect soon convinces the\r\nspectator that he is not to look to the Alps alone, or to the rocky\r\nregions of Altai, bordering on Siberia, for romantic scenes of wildness,\r\nconfusion and disorder. Snowdon presents them in all their rude and\r\nnative majesty.\r\n\r\nIn the ascent, a narrow path not more than nine feet in width, leads\r\nalong the margin of a frightful precipice of nearly fifteen hundred feet\r\nin extent, so perpendicular that it can not be approached without\r\nterror; while to the north of the summit nearest to the one the most\r\nelevated, a semi-amphitheater of precipitous rocks, also of a great\r\nhight, is seen; and, behind this summit, another semicircle of equal\r\ndepth and extent. The loftiest summit here appears to descend in the\r\nform of a sharp ridge, and beneath it another appears, which, on account\r\nof its color, is called the Black Rock. From the upper part of the\r\nvalley, one of these summits presents a grand, vertical, and very\r\nelevated point.\r\n\r\nThe bottom of each of the amphitheaters of rocks, thirteen in number, is\r\noccupied by a small lake of a circular form, and very deep. The one\r\nknown by the name of Llyn Glass is remarkable for its green hue, derived\r\nfrom its being impregnated with copper, several mines of which line its\r\nborders. Than this mountain, nothing in the Alps can be more arid and\r\ndesert, those regions alone excepted which are too lofty to admit of\r\nvegetation. Here there is not a tree, not even a shrub; small patches of\r\nverdure, which sheep can scarcely reach, are alone to be seen. Its\r\nsummit, or highest peak, is a flat of about eighteen feet only in\r\ncircumference. Thence may be seen a part of Ireland, a part of Scotland,\r\nCumberland, Lancashire, Cheshire, all North Wales, the isle of Man, and\r\nthe Irish and British seas, with innumerable lakes; while the whole\r\nisland of Anglesea is displayed so distinctly, that, its flat\r\nuncultivated plains, bounded by the rich Parys mountain in the vicinity\r\nof Holyhead, may be descried as on a map.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CADER IDRIS.\r\n\r\nTo the south of Dolgellau, Cader Idris towers above the subject\r\nmountains, which seem to retire, to allow its base more room to stand,\r\nand to afford to their sovereign a better display. It stands on a broad\r\nrocky base, with a gradual ascent to its brow, when the peaks elevate\r\nthemselves in a manner at once abrupt, picturesque and distinct. The\r\npoint emphatically named Cader, appears to the eye below to be little\r\nsuperior in hight to the saddle; but the third point, or apex, which has\r\na name expressive of its sterility, is neither equal in hight, nor in\r\nbeauty, to the other two. On its loftiest peak a stone pillar has lately\r\nbeen erected, for the purpose of a trigonometrical survey.\r\n\r\nCader Idris is the commencement of a chain of primitive mountains, and\r\nis computed to be twenty-eight hundred and fifty feet above the green of\r\nDolgellau, and thirty-five hundred and fifty feet, or nearly\r\nthree-fourths of a mile above the level of the sea. It has been\r\nconjectured that at some remote period it was a volcano of immense\r\nmagnitude.\r\n\r\nThe tract to the south of Cader Idris, as far as Talylyn and Malwydd, is\r\npeculiarly grand. High and rugged mountains of every possible form,\r\nclose in on all sides, while huge masses of rock hang over, or lie\r\nscattered in misshapen fragments by the side of the road. To add to the\r\neffect of this scene, the river Difi forms one continued cataract for\r\nfive or six miles, overflowing with the innumerable tributary torrents\r\nwhich precipitate themselves from the highest summits of the surrounding\r\nrocks; while, to crown the whole, the shady head of Cader Idris towers,\r\nthe majestic sentinel of the group.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              PENMAN-MAWR.\r\n\r\nThe county of Caernarvon, in which this mountain is situated, claims\r\nprecedency over every other in Wales, for the loftiness of its\r\nmountains, and the multitude of the eminences, which in a curved and\r\nindented chain, occupy nearly the whole of its extent.\r\n\r\nIn proceeding from Conway to Bangor, by a route at once picturesque and\r\nromantic, and amid a scenery which varies at every step, Penman-mawr\r\ndiscloses to the traveler its bulky head. It protrudes itself into the\r\nsea, and exhibits a fine contrast to the fertility which it interrupts,\r\nby a rude view of gray weather-beaten stones and precipices. The passage\r\nover the mountain was formerly terrific; but the road has been latterly\r\nwidened and secured, near the verge of the precipice, by a small wall\r\nabout five feet in hight. It forms the most sublime terrace in the\r\nBritish isles, winding round the mountain on the edge of the abrupt\r\ncliff; while the vast impending rocks above, the roaring of the waves at\r\na great distance below, and the frequent howling of the wind, all unite\r\nto fill the mind with solemnity and awe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                SKIDDAW.\r\n\r\nThis English mountain, which has an elevation of thirty-five hundred and\r\nthirty feet, or nearly three-fourths of a mile above the level of the\r\nsea, is situated in Cumberland. It is more remarkable on account of the\r\nscenery over which it presides, and which exceeds in beauty whatever the\r\nimagination can paint, than for those bold projections and that rugged\r\nmajesty which might be expected, but which will be here sought in vain.\r\nExcept at such a distance as smooths the embossed work of all these rich\r\nfabrics, and where its double summit makes it a distinguished object to\r\nmark and characterize a scene, it may be considered as a tame and\r\ninanimate object.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               WHARNSIDE.\r\n\r\nIn some of the maps of Yorkshire, the hight of this mountain is greatly\r\nexaggerated, its elevation above the sea not being more than twenty-five\r\nhundred feet, or nearly half a mile. As it is situated in the midst of a\r\nvast amphitheater of hills, the prospect it affords is diversified with\r\npleasing objects. On its summit are four or five small lakes, two of\r\nwhich are about nine hundred feet in length, and nearly the same in\r\nbreadth. A thin seam of coal also occurs near the top, and another is\r\nsaid to correspond with it on the summit of the lofty Colm hill, on the\r\nopposite side of Dent dale. Numerous caves and other natural curiosities\r\nabound here, as well as on Pennigent, about six miles to the eastward of\r\nIngleborough. These latter mountains do not possess any particular\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               STROMBOLI.\r\n\r\nStromboli is the principal of the cluster of small islands, lying to the\r\nnorth of Sicily, named the Lipari isles, the whole of which contain\r\nvolcanoes. At a distance, its form appears to be that of an exact cone,\r\nbut on a closer examination it is found to be a mountain having two\r\nsummits of different hights, the sides of which have been torn and\r\nshattered by craters. The most elevated summit, inclining to the\r\nsouth-west, is, agreeably to Spallanzani, about a mile in hight.\r\n\r\nIn this volcanic mountain, the effects of a constantly active fire are\r\neverywhere visible, heaping up, destroying, changing, and overturning\r\nevery instant what itself has produced, and incessantly varying in its\r\noperations. At the distance of one hundred miles, the flames it emits\r\nare visible, whence it has been aptly denominated the light-house of\r\nthat part of the Mediterranean sea.\r\n\r\nFrom the more elevated summit, all the inner part of the burning crater,\r\nand the mode of its eruption, may be seen. It is placed about half-way\r\nup, on the north-west side of the mountain, and has a diameter not\r\nexceeding two hundred and fifty feet. Burning stones are thrown up at\r\nregular intervals of seven or eight minutes, ascending in somewhat\r\ndiverging rays. While a portion of them roll down toward the sea, the\r\ngreater part fall back into the crater; and these being again cast out\r\nby a subsequent eruption, are thus tossed about until they are broken\r\nand reduced to ashes. The volcano, however, constantly supplies others,\r\nand seems inexhaustible in this species of productions. Spallanzani\r\naffirms that, in the more violent eruptions, the ejected matter rises to\r\nthe hight of half a mile, or even higher, many of the ignited stones\r\nbeing thrown above the highest summit of the mountain.\r\n\r\nThe erupted stones, which appear black in the day-time, have at night a\r\ndeep red color, and sparkle like fire-works. Each explosion is\r\naccompanied by flames or smoke, the latter resembling clouds, in the\r\nlower part black, in the upper white and shining, and separating into\r\nglobular and irregular forms. In particularly high winds from the south\r\nor south-east, the smoke spreads over every part of the island.\r\nSpallanzani observed this volcano on a particular night, when the latter\r\nof these winds blew with great violence. The clear sky exhibited the\r\nappearance of a beautiful aurora borealis over that part of the mountain\r\non which the volcano is situated, and which from time to time became\r\nmore red and brilliant, in proportion as the ignited stones were thrown\r\nto a greater hight. The violence of the convulsions depends on that of\r\nthe wind.\r\n\r\nThe present crater has burned for more than a century, without any\r\napparent change having taken place in its situation. The side from which\r\nthe showers of ignited matter fall into the sea, is almost\r\nperpendicular, about half a mile broad at the bottom, and a mile in\r\nlength, terminating above in a point. In rolling down, the lava raises\r\nthe fine sand like a cloud of dust. While this was observed by\r\nSpallanzani, the volcano suddenly made an eruption. Numerous pieces of\r\nlava of a dark red color, and enveloped in smoke, were ejected from the\r\ntop of the precipice, and thrown high into the air. A part of them fell\r\non the declivity, and rolled down, the smaller preceded by the greater;\r\nafter a few bounds, dashing into the sea, giving out a sharp hissing\r\nsound. The more minute fragments, from their lightness, and the\r\nhindrance of the sand, rolled slowly down, and striking against each\r\nother, produced nearly the same sound as hail-stones falling on a roof.\r\nIn a few minutes another explosion followed, without any sensible noise;\r\nand two minutes after a third eruption took place, with a much louder\r\nexplosion than the first, and a far more copious ejection of lava. The\r\neruptions, which were almost innumerable during the time Spallanzani\r\nremained there, all exhibited the same appearances.\r\n\r\nOn the night following the one above described, the volcano raged with\r\nstill greater violence, and rapidly hurled to a great hight, thousands\r\nof red-hot stones, forming diverging rays in the air. Those which rolled\r\ndown the precipice, produced a hail of streaming fire, which illuminated\r\nthe steep descent. Independently of these ignited stones, there was in\r\nthe air which hovered over the volcano, a vivid light, which was not\r\nextinguished when that was at rest. It was not properly flame, but real\r\nlight reverberated by the atmosphere, impregnated by extraneous\r\nparticles, and more especially by the ascending smoke. Besides varying\r\nin intensity, it appeared constantly in motion, ascending, descending,\r\ndilating and contracting, but always remaining perpendicular over the\r\nmouth of the volcano, which showed that it was occasioned by the\r\nconflagration within the crater. The detonations in the greater\r\neruptions resembled the roaring of distant thunder, and in the lesser\r\nones, the explosions of a mine. In the smallest they were scarcely\r\naudible. Each was some seconds later than the ejection.\r\n\r\nNear the mouth of the volcano is a small cavern, a projection above\r\nwhich secures it from the entrance of the ignited stones. From this\r\ncavern Spallanzani was enabled to look down into the very bowels of the\r\nvolcano. He describes the edges of the crater as of a circular form, and\r\nnot more than three hundred and forty feet in circumference, the\r\ninternal sides contracting as they descend, and assuming the shape of a\r\ntruncated inverted cone. The crater itself, to a certain hight, is\r\nfilled with a liquid red-hot matter, resembling melted brass. This is\r\nthe fluid lava, which appears to be agitated by two distinct motions,\r\nthe one intestine, whirling and tumultuous, and the other that by which\r\nit is impelled upward. This liquid matter is raised, sometimes with\r\nmore, and sometimes with less rapidity, within the crater; and when it\r\nhas reached within twenty-five or thirty feet of the upper edge, a sound\r\nis heard not unlike a short clap of thunder, while at the same moment a\r\nportion of the lava, separated into a thousand pieces, is thrown up with\r\nindescribable swiftness, accompanied by a copious eruption of smoke,\r\nashes and sand. A few moments before the report, the superficies of the\r\nlava is inflated and covered with large bubbles, some of which are\r\nseveral feet in diameter; on the bursting of these the detonation and\r\nfiery shower take place. After the explosion, the lava within the crater\r\nsinks, but soon rises again as before, and new bubbles appear, which\r\nagain burst and produce new explosions. When the lava sinks, it gives\r\nlittle or no sound; but when it rises, and particularly when it begins\r\nto be inflated with bubbles, it is accompanied by a noise similar, in\r\nproportion to the difference of magnitude, to that of liquor boiling\r\nvehemently in a caldron.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                LIPARI.\r\n\r\nThis island, which has given name to the whole cluster, is deserving of\r\nnotice on account of its celebrated “_stoves_.” They are the only\r\nvestiges of subterraneous conflagration now remaining, and lie to the\r\nwest of the city, on the summit of a mountain of considerable elevation,\r\ncalled Monte della Stufe, the Mountain of Stoves. They consist of five\r\nexcavations, in the form of grottos; but two of them have been abandoned\r\non account of the great heat, an exposure to which might cause\r\nsuffocation. Even the stones are so hot that they can not be touched;\r\nbut still the heat varies, and experiences all the vicissitudes of\r\nvolcanoes. The ground is not penetrated with hot vapors issuing from\r\nseveral apertures, as has been asserted. Spallanzani, however, found one\r\nfrom which a thin stream of smoke issued from time to time, with a\r\nstrong sulphureous smell, indicating the remains of conflagration\r\nexisting beneath.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to fix the exact epoch at which the fires of Lipari\r\nwere extinguished, or rather the period at which the eruptions ceased,\r\nfor the existence of the former may be deduced from the hot springs and\r\nstoves. Dolomieu thinks the last eruptions are as old as the sixth\r\ncentury of the Christian era, and conjectures that they may have ceased\r\nsince the fires found a new vent in Vulcano, since he does not entertain\r\nany doubt but that the two islands have a subterraneous communication.\r\nOf this the inhabitants of Lipari are so well convinced, that they are\r\nin the greatest agitation when Vulcano does not smoke, and when its\r\npassages are obstructed. They fear shocks and violent eruptions,\r\nsuspecting even that the fires may again break out in their island. It\r\nis a fact that the earthquakes, which are very frequent, generally cease\r\nwhen the eruptions of Vulcano commence.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                VULCANO.\r\n\r\nThis, which is the last of the Lipari isles, bears in every part the\r\nstamp of fire. It was the superstitious belief of the ancient\r\ninhabitants that Vulcan had here established his forges, there being\r\nconstant fires during the night, and a thick smoke throughout the day.\r\nIt consists of a mountain in the form of a truncated cone, which is,\r\nhowever, merely a case opening and exposing to view a second cone\r\nwithin, more exact than the other, and in which the mouth of the volcano\r\nis placed. The latter is thus enveloped on three sides by the ancient\r\ncone, and is open only on that side which is immediately washed by the\r\nsea.\r\n\r\nThe base of the interior cone is separated from the steep sides of the\r\nancient crater by a circular valley, which terminates on one side at the\r\njunction of the two mountains, and on the other sinks into the sea. In\r\nthis valley, light pumice-stones are blended with fragments of black,\r\nvitreous lava, and buried in ashes perfectly white. The blow of a hammer\r\non these stones produces a loud hollow sound, which reëchoes in the\r\nneighboring caverns, and proves that the surface is nothing more than\r\nthe arch of a vault covering an immense abyss. The sound varies\r\naccording to the thickness of the crust, which must have considerable\r\nsolidity to support the weight of the new mountain. This, according to\r\nDolomieu, is higher and steeper than the cone which contains the crater\r\nof Etna, and its access still more difficult; its perpendicular hight,\r\nhowever, is not more than twenty-six hundred and forty feet, or half a\r\nmile. He represents the crater of Vulcano as the most magnificent he\r\never saw; and Spallanzani observes that, with the exception of that of\r\nEtna, he does not know of any more capacious and majestic. It exceeds a\r\nmile in circuit, has an oval mouth, and its greatest diameter is from\r\nthe south-east to the west, while its depth is not more than a quarter\r\nof a mile. The bottom is flat, and from many places streams of smoke\r\nexhale, emitting a strong sulphureous vapor. This vast cavity is very\r\nregular, and as its entire contents are displayed to the eye, presents\r\none of the grandest and most imposing spectacles in nature. On large\r\nstones being rolled down, the mountain reëchoes; and on their reaching\r\nthe bottom, they appear to sink in fluid. Indeed, with the aid of a\r\nglass, two small lakes, supposed to be filled with melted sulphur, have\r\nbeen discovered. The declivity of the interior walls is so great, that,\r\neven when there is not any danger from fire, the descent is next to\r\nimpossible. After considerable difficulty, however, this was\r\naccomplished by Spallanzani on the south-east side, the only one\r\naccessible. He found the bottom to be somewhat more than one-third of a\r\nmile in circumference, and of an oval form. The subterraneous noise was\r\nhere much louder than on the summit, sounding like an impetuous river\r\nfoaming beneath, or, rather, like a conflict of agitated waves meeting\r\nand clashing furiously together. The ground was likewise in some places\r\nperforated with apertures, from which hissing sounds issued, resembling\r\nthose produced by the bellows of a furnace. It shook when pressed by the\r\nfeet; and a large piece of lava, let fall five or six feet, produced a\r\nsubterraneous echoing sound, which continued some time, and was loudest\r\nin the center. These circumstances, combined with its burning heat, and\r\nthe strong stench of sulphur it emits, prove that the fires of the\r\nvolcano are still active.\r\n\r\nIts eruptions have been most considerable during the earthquakes which\r\nhave desolated Sicily and a greater part of Italy. In the month of\r\nMarch, 1786, after subterraneous thunders and roarings, which were heard\r\nover all the islands, to the great terror of the inhabitants, and were\r\naccompanied by frequent concussions, the crater threw out a prodigious\r\nquantity of sand, mixed with immense volumes of smoke and fire. This\r\neruption continued fifteen days, and so great was the quantity of sand\r\nejected that the circumjacent places were entirely covered with it to a\r\nconsiderable hight. The lava did not flow at the time, at least over the\r\nedges of the crater; and indeed, such a current is not remembered by any\r\nliving person.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        THE HIMALAYA MOUNTAINS.\r\n                       BETWEEN INDIA AND THIBET.\r\n\r\n“The great Himalayan snowy range,” says Mr. Fraser, “is only the high\r\nelevated crest of the mountainous tract that divides the plains of\r\nHindoostan from those of Thibet, or Lesser Tartary. Far as they\r\npredominate over, and precipitously as they rear themselves above the\r\nrest, all the hills that appear in distant ranges, when viewed from the\r\nplains, are indeed only the roots and branches of this great stem; and,\r\nhowever difficult to trace, the connection can always be detected\r\nbetween each inferior mountain and some particular member of its great\r\norigin.\r\n\r\n“The horizontal depth of this mountainous tract, on that side which\r\noverlooks Hindoostan, is no doubt various; but, from the difficulty of\r\nthe country, a traveler performs a journey of many days before he\r\nreaches the foot of the immediate snowy cliffs. The best observations\r\nand surveys do not authorize the allowance of more than an average depth\r\nof about sixty miles from the plains to the commencement of these, in\r\nthat part of the country that forms the subject of this narrative. The\r\nbreadth of the snowy zone itself in all probability varies still more;\r\nfor huge masses advance in some places into the lower districts, and in\r\nothers the crest recedes in long ravines, that are the beds of torrents,\r\nwhile behind they are clothed by a succession of the loftier cliffs.\r\nEvery account we receive of a passage through them, (and this is no\r\ndoubt found most commonly where the belt is narrowest,) gives a detail\r\nof many days’ journey through the deserts of snow and rocks; and it is\r\nto be inferred, that on the north-east side they advance to, and retreat\r\nfrom the low ground in an equally irregular manner. Indeed, some\r\naccounts would induce the belief, that long ranges, crowned with\r\nsnow-clad peaks, project in various places from the great spine, and\r\ninclude habitable and milder districts; for, in all the routes of which\r\nwe have accounts, that proceed, in various directions toward the\r\nTrans-Himalayan countries, hills covered with snow are occasionally\r\nmentioned as occurring, even after the great deserts are passed, and the\r\ngrazing country entered. The breadth, then, of this crest of snow-clad\r\nrock itself, can not fairly be estimated at less than from seventy to\r\neighty miles.\r\n\r\n“The great snowy belt, although its loftiest crest is broken into\r\nnumberless cliffs and ravines, nevertheless presents a barrier perfectly\r\nimpracticable, except in those places where hollows that become the beds\r\nof rivers have in some degree intersected it, and facilitated approach\r\nto its more remote recesses, or courageous and attentive perseverance\r\nhas here and there, discovered a dangerous and difficult path, by which\r\na possibility exists of penetrating across the range. Few rivers hold\r\ntheir course wholly through it: indeed, in the upper part the Sutlej\r\nalone has been traced beyond this rocky barrier; and there is a path\r\nalong its stream, from different parts of which roads diverge, that lead\r\nin various directions through the mountain. No reasonable doubt can now\r\nexist of the very long and extraordinary course which this river takes.\r\n\r\n“Captain Webb of the Bengal establishment, was at one time employed on a\r\nsurvey of a province of Kumaoon. On the twenty-first day of June, his\r\ncamp was eleven thousand, six hundred and eighty feet above Calcutta.\r\nThe surface was covered with very rich vegetation as high as the knee;\r\nthere were very extensive beds of strawberries in full flower; and\r\nplenty of currant-bushes in blossom all around, in a clear spot of rich\r\nblack mold soil, surrounded by a noble forest of pine, oak and\r\nrhododendron. On the twenty-second of June he reached the top of\r\nPilgoenta-Churhaee, (or ascent,) twelve thousand, six hundred and\r\nforty-two feet above Calcutta. He was prevented from distinguishing very\r\ndistant objects by a dense fog; but there was not the smallest patch of\r\nsnow near him; and the surface, a fat black mold through which the rock\r\npeeped, was covered with strawberry plants, (not yet in flower,)\r\nbutter-cups, dandelions, and a profusion of other flowers. The shoulders\r\nof the hill above him, about four hundred and fifty feet more elevated,\r\nwere covered with the same to the top; and above five hundred feet below\r\nwas a forest of pine, rhododendron and birch. There was some snow seen\r\nbelow in deep hollows, but it dissolves in the course of the season.\r\nThese facts led Captain Webb to infer, that the inferior limit of\r\nperpetual congelation on the Himalaya mountains is beyond thirteen\r\nthousand, five hundred feet, at least, above the level of Calcutta: and\r\nthat the level of the table-land of Tartary, immediately bordering on\r\ntheir range, is very far elevated beyond eight thousand feet, the hight\r\nat which it has been estimated.\r\n\r\n“On the night of the sixteenth of July, we slept at Bheemkeudar, near\r\nthe source of the Coonoo and Bheem streams. There is no wood near this\r\nplace, even in the very bottom of the valley, and we had left even the\r\nstunted birch at a considerable distance below; but there was a\r\nprofusion of flowers, ferns, thistles, &c., and luxuriant pasturage.\r\nCaptain Webb’s limit of wood is at least as high as twelve thousand to\r\ntwelve thousand, three hundred feet. I would, therefore, presume the\r\nsite of Bheemkeudar to be considerably above that level; say thirteen\r\nthousand to thirteen thousand, three hundred feet, above the level of\r\nCalcutta. From thence we ascended at first rather gradually, and then\r\nvery rapidly, till we left all luxuriant vegetation, and entered the\r\nregion of stripped and scattered and partially melting snow. From\r\ncalculating the distance passed, and adverting to the elevation we had\r\nattained, I would presume that this was at least fifteen hundred feet\r\nabove Bheemkeudar, or from fourteen thousand, five hundred, to fifteen\r\nthousand feet above Calcutta.\r\n\r\n“We proceeded onward, ascending very rapidly, while vegetation decreased\r\ngradually to a mere green moss, with here and there a few snow-flowers\r\nstarting through it; snow fast increasing, till at length we entered on\r\nwhat I presume was the perennial and unmelting snow, entirely beyond the\r\nline of vegetation, where the rock was bare even of lichens: and in this\r\nwe ascended, as I think, about eight hundred feet; for, though Bamsooroo\r\nGhat may not be so far above this line, we continued ascending, even\r\nafter crossing that point, and I would incline to estimate this utmost\r\nextent of ascent at two thousand feet more, or nearly seventeen thousand\r\nfeet above the level of Calcutta.\r\n\r\n“Whilst proposing to consider the point of sixteen thousand to sixteen\r\nthousand, five hundred feet, as that of inferior congelation, I must\r\nobserve that there was no feeling of _frost_ in the air, and the snow\r\nwas moist, though hard, chiefly through the influence of a thick mist,\r\nwhich, in fact, amounted to a very small drizzling rain, which fell\r\naround: all which would seem to indicate, that the true line of\r\ncongelation had not there been attained; but we were surrounded by snow\r\nwhich evidently never melted. To a great depth below it extended all\r\nover the hills, very little broken, while on the valleys from whence the\r\nCoonoo and Bheem streams issue, at full two thousand feet below, it lay\r\ncovering them and the surrounding mountains in an unbroken mass, many\r\nhundred feet thick. Thus, though it may seem contradictory, the line of\r\nperpetual congelation, in fact seems fixable at even below the point I\r\nhave ventured to indicate, and, I presume, might, on these grounds, be\r\nplaced somewhere between fifteen and sixteen thousand feet above the\r\nlevel of Calcutta.\r\n\r\n“The result of all the considerations that arise out of the foregoing\r\nremarks is a belief, that the loftiest peaks of the Himalaya range will\r\nbe found to fall considerably short of the hight attributed to them by\r\nMr. Colebrooke; and that their loftiest peaks do not more than range\r\nfrom eighteen thousand to twenty-two or twenty-three thousand feet above\r\nthe level of the sea.\r\n\r\n“Having reached the top of an ascent, we looked down upon a very deep\r\nand dark glen, called Palia Gadh, which is the outlet to the waters of\r\none of the most terrific and gloomy valleys I have ever seen. But it\r\nwould not be easy to convey by any description a just idea of the\r\npeculiarly rugged and gloomy wildness of this glen: it looks like the\r\nruins of nature, and appears, as it is said to be, completely\r\nimpracticable and impenetrable. Little is to be seen except dark rock:\r\nwood only fringes the lower parts and the waters’ edge: perhaps the\r\nspots and streaks of snow, contrasting with the general blackness of the\r\nscene, highten the appearance of desolation. No living thing is seen; no\r\nmotion is visible but that of the waters; no sound is heard but their\r\nroar. Such a spot is suited to engender superstition, and here it is\r\naccordingly found in full growth. Many wild traditions are preserved,\r\nand many extravagant stories related of it.\r\n\r\n“The glen above described, is by far the most gloomy, savage scene we\r\nhave yet met with. I regret that the weather did not permit a sketch of\r\nit to be attempted. Beyond this we could see nothing in the course of\r\nthe river but rocky banks. The opposite side is particularly\r\nprecipitous; yet along its face a road is carried, which is frequented\r\nas much as this, and leads to villages still farther up. By the time we\r\nhad reached the village, the clouds which had lowered around and sunk\r\ndown on the hills, began to burst with loud thunder and heavy rain. The\r\nnoise was fearfully reverberated among the hills; and during the night\r\nmore than once the sound was heard of fragments from the brows of the\r\nmountains, crashing down to the depths below with a terrific din. Our\r\nquarters were good. I slept in a temple, neat, clean and secure from the\r\nweather.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SOURCE OF THE JUMNA.]\r\n\r\n\r\n          GUNGOTREE, THE SOURCE OF THE JUMNA, A BRANCH OF THE\r\n                   GANGES, IN THE HIMALAYA MOUNTAINS.\r\n\r\nGungotree, the source of the Jumna, represented in the cut below, the\r\nmost sacred branch of the Ganges, ought to hold, and does hold the first\r\nrank among its holy places. Here all is mythological ground. Here\r\nMahadeo sits enthroned in clouds and mist, amid rocks that defy the\r\napproach of living thing, and snows that make desolation more awful.\r\nGods, goddesses and saints here continually adore him at mysterious\r\ndistance, and you traverse their familiar haunts. But, although\r\nGungotree be the most sacred, it is not the most frequented shrine,\r\naccess to it being far more difficult than to Buddrinauth; and\r\nconsequently to this latter, pilgrims flock in crowds, appalled at the\r\nremoteness and danger of the former place of worship. This may pretty\r\nfully account for the superior riches and splendor of Buddrinauth. Here\r\nare temples of considerable extent, priests and officials in abundance,\r\nwho preserve an imposing exterior, and an appearance venerable from\r\npower and comparative magnificence, and consequently procure rich and\r\nample offerings to keep up their comfortable dignity.\r\n\r\nThe temple of Bhadrinath, is situated on the west bank of the Alackunda,\r\nin a valley four miles long, and one mile in its greatest breadth. The\r\neast bank rises considerably higher than the west bank, and is on a\r\nlevel with the top of the temple. The position of the sanctuary is\r\nconsidered equidistant from two lofty mountains, which are designated by\r\nthe names of the Nar and the Narayena Purvatas. The former is to the\r\neast, the latter to the west, and completely covered with snow from the\r\nsummit to the base.\r\n\r\nThe temple of Bhadri-Nath has more beneficed lands attached to it than\r\nany sacred Hindoo establishment in this part of India. It is said to\r\npossess seven hundred villages in different parts of Gurwhal and\r\nKumaoon: many of them have been conferred by the government; others have\r\nbeen given in pledge for loans; and some few, purchased by individuals,\r\nhave been presented as religious offerings.\r\n\r\nThe annual ceremony of carrying the images of their gods to wash in the\r\nsacred stream of the Jumna, is, it appears, one of much solemnity among\r\nthe inhabitants of the neighborhood; and the concourse of people that\r\nhere assemble, are busily engaged, and continue to be fully occupied in\r\ndoing honor to it. They dance to the sound of strange music, and\r\nintoxicate themselves with a sort of vile spirit, brewed from grain and\r\nparticular roots, sometimes, it is said, sharpened by pepper. The dance\r\nis most grotesque and savage; a multitude of men taking hands sometimes\r\nin a circle, sometimes in a line, beating time with their feet, bend\r\nwith one accord, first nearly to the earth with their faces, then\r\nbackward, and then sidewise, with various wild contortions. These, and\r\ntheir uncouth dress of black and gray blankets, give a peculiar air of\r\nbrutal ferocity to the assemblage. The men dance all day, and in the\r\nevening they are joined by the women, who mix indiscriminately with\r\nthem, and keep up dancing and intoxication till the night is far\r\nadvanced. They continue this frantic kind of worship for several days;\r\nand, in truth, it is much in unison with their general manners and\r\nhabits, savage and inconsistent. At a place so sacred, the residence of\r\nso many Brahmins, and the resort of so many pilgrims, we might expect to\r\nfind a strict attention to the forms of religion, and a scrupulous\r\nobservance of the privations and austerities enjoined by it. So far,\r\nhowever, is this from the truth, that much is met with, shocking even to\r\nthose Hindoos who are less bigoted.\r\n\r\n“There were several points to be arranged,” says Mr. Fraser, “before we\r\ncould set off for Gungotree, the source of the Jumna. I did not deem it\r\nproper to go unarmed; but agreed that only five men should be accoutered\r\nto attend us, and that I should myself carry my gun. But all these\r\nweapons of war were to be put aside before we got within sight of the\r\nholy spot, and deposited in a cave near it, under a guard. I also\r\npledged myself that no use should be made of these instruments, nor any\r\nlife sacrificed for the purpose of food, either by myself or by any of\r\nmy people, after leaving the village, until we returned; moreover, that\r\nI would not even carry meat of any sort, dead or alive, along with me,\r\nbut eat only rice and bread. As to the putting off my shoes, they did\r\nnot even propose it to me, and it could not have been done; but I\r\nvolunteered to put them off, when entering into the precincts of the\r\ntemple and holier places, which pleased them greatly. All the Hindoos,\r\nincluding the Ghoorkhas, went from the village barefoot.\r\n\r\n“Just at the end of the bridge there is an overhanging rock, under which\r\nworship is performed to Bhyram, and a black stone partly painted red, is\r\nthe image of the god; and here not only were prayers and worship\r\nperformed, but every one was obliged to bathe and eat bread baked by the\r\nBrahmins, as preparatory to the great and effectual ablutions at the\r\nholier Gungotree. This occupied a considerable time, as the party was\r\nnumerous: in the mean time I took a very imperfect sketch of the scene,\r\nafter which I bathed myself at the proper place, which is the junction\r\nof the two streams, while the Brahmin prayed over me. Among the\r\nceremonies performed, he made me hold a tuft of grass while he prayed,\r\nwhich at the conclusion he directed me to throw into the eddy occasioned\r\nby the meeting of the two waters.\r\n\r\n“By an unpleasant path we reached a step, or level spot on the first\r\nstage of the mountain, where, in a thick grove of fir-trees, is placed a\r\nsmall temple to Bhyram, a plain white building, built by order of Umur\r\nSing T’happa, who gave a sum of money to repair the road, and erect\r\nplaces of worship here, and at Gungotree. Having paid our respects to\r\nByramjee, we proceeded along the side of the hill on the right bank,\r\nnorth of the river, gradually ascending by a path equally difficult and\r\ndangerous as the first part of our ascent, but more fearful, as the\r\nprecipice to the river, which rolls below us, increases in hight, and\r\nexceedingly toilsome from the nature of the ground over which it passes,\r\nand which consists wholly of sharp fragments from the cliffs above, with\r\nfallen trunks and broken branches of trees.\r\n\r\n“The path increases in difficulty from the very irregular nature of the\r\nground, as well as the steepness of the hill face across which it leads,\r\nascending and descending as the small, though deep water-courses furrow\r\nthe mountain side, in loose soil, formed of small fragments fallen from\r\nabove, and which slip down, threatening to carry the traveler to the\r\ngulf below. The shapeless blocks of rock now more completely obstruct\r\nthe way, and for hundreds of yards, at times, the passenger must clamber\r\nover these masses, heaped as they are one upon another, in monstrous\r\nconfusion, and so uncertain and unsteady, that, huge though they are,\r\nthey shake and move even under the burden of a man’s weight. So painful\r\nindeed is this track, that it might be conceived as meant to serve as a\r\npenance to the unfortunate pilgrims with bare feet, thus to prepare them\r\nfor the special and conclusive act of piety they have in view, as the\r\nobject of their journey to these extreme wilds.\r\n\r\n“The spot which bears the name of Gungotree, is concealed by the\r\nroughness of the ground, and the masses of fallen rock, so as not to be\r\nseen till the traveler comes close upon it. The temple is situated\r\nprecisely on the sacred stone on which Bhagirutte used to worship\r\nMahadeo, and is a small building of a square shape for about twelve feet\r\nhigh, and rounding in, in the usual form of pagodas, to the top. It is\r\nquite plain, painted white, with red moldings, and surmounted with the\r\nusual melon-shaped ornaments of these buildings. From the eastern face\r\nof the square, which is turned nearly to the sacred source, there is a\r\nsmall projection covered with a stone roof, in which is the entrance\r\nfacing the east, and just opposite this there is a small pagoda-shaped\r\ntemple to Bhyramjee. The whole is surrounded by a wall of unhewn stone\r\nand lime, and the space this contains is paved with flat stones. In this\r\nspace too, there is a comfortable but small house for the residence of\r\nthe Brahmins who come to officiate. Without the inclosure there are two\r\nor three sheds constructed of wood, called _dhurum sallahs_, built for\r\nthe accommodation of pilgrims who resort here; and there are many caves\r\naround formed by overhanging stones, which yield a shelter to those who\r\ncan not find accommodation in the sheds.\r\n\r\n“The scene in which this holy place is situated, is worthy of the\r\nmysterious sanctity attributed to it, and the reverence with which it is\r\nregarded. We have not here the confined gloominess of Bhyram Gattee: the\r\nactual dread which can not but be inspired by the precipices and\r\ntorrents, and perils of the place, here gives way to a sensation of awe,\r\nimposing but not embarrassing, that might be compared to the dark and\r\ndangerous pass to the center of the ruins of a former world; for, most\r\ntruly, there is little here that recalls the recollection of that which\r\nwe seem to have quitted. The bare and peaked cliffs which shoot to the\r\nskies, yield not in ruggedness or elevation to any we have seen; their\r\nruins lie in wild chaotic masses at their feet, and scantier wood\r\nimperfectly relieves their nakedness: even the dark pine more rarely\r\nroots itself in the deep chasms which time has worn. Thus on all sides\r\nis the prospect closed, except in front to the eastward; where, from\r\nbehind a mass of bare spires, four huge, lofty, snowy peaks arise: these\r\nare the peaks of Roodroo-Himala. There could be no finer finishing, no\r\ngrander close to such a scene, as is visible in the engraving.\r\n\r\n“We approach it through a labyrinth of enormous shapeless masses of\r\ngranite, which during ages have fallen from the cliffs above, that frown\r\nover the very temple, and in all probability will some day themselves\r\ndescend in ruins and crush it. Around the inclosure, and among these\r\nmasses, for some distance up the mountain, a few fine old pine-trees\r\nthrow a dark shade and form a magnificent foreground; while the river\r\nruns impetuously in its shingly bed, and the stifled but fearful sound\r\nof the stones which it rolls along with it, crushing together, mixes\r\nwith the roar of its waters.\r\n\r\n“It is easy to write of rocks and wilds, of torrents and precipices; it\r\nis easy to tell of the awe such scenes inspire: this style and these\r\ndescriptions are common and hackneyed. But it is not so simple, to many\r\nsurely not very possible, to convey an adequate idea of the stern and\r\nrugged majesty of some scenes; to paint their lonely desertness, or\r\ndescribe the undefinable sensation of reverence and dread that steals\r\nover the mind while contemplating the death-like, ghastly calm that is\r\nshed over them: and when at such a moment we remember our homes, our\r\nfriends, our firesides, and all social intercourse with our fellows, and\r\nfeel our present solitude, and far distance from all these dear ties,\r\nhow vain it is to strive at description! Surely such a scene is\r\nGungotree. [See cut, page 109.] Nor is it, independently of the nature\r\nof the surrounding scenery, a spot which lightly calls forth powerful\r\nfeelings. We were now in the center of the stupendous Himalaya, the\r\nloftiest and perhaps most rugged range of mountains in the world. We\r\nwere at the acknowledged source of that noble river, which is equally an\r\nobject of veneration and a source of fertility, plenty and opulence to\r\nHindoostan; and we had now reached the holiest shrine of Hindoo worship\r\nwhich these holy hills contain. These are surely striking\r\nconsiderations, combining with the solemn grandeur of the place, to move\r\nthe feelings strongly.\r\n\r\n“The fortuitous circumstance of being the first European that ever\r\npenetrated to this spot, was no matter of boast, for no great danger had\r\nbeen braved, no extraordinary fatigues undergone; the road is now open\r\nto any other who chooses to attempt it; but it was a matter of\r\nsatisfaction to myself. The first object of inquiry that naturally\r\noccurs to the traveler, after casting a glance over the general\r\nlandscape, is the source of the river. Here, as at Jumnotree, you are\r\ntold that no mortal has gone, or can go further toward its extreme\r\norigin than this spot; and the difficulty is indeed very apparent. I\r\nmade a trial to gain a point about two furlongs beyond the temple, both\r\nfor the purpose of observing the course of the river, and of seeing\r\nGungotree in another point of view. But having with considerable\r\ndifficulty made my way over the unsteady fragments for some hundred\r\nyards, at the risk of being precipitated into the stream, I was forced\r\nto turn back.\r\n\r\n“The source is not more than five miles’ horizontal distance from the\r\ntemple, and in a direction south-east, eighty-five degrees nearly; and\r\nbeyond this place it is in all probability chiefly supplied by the\r\nmelting of the great bosom of snow which terminates the valley, and\r\nwhich lies between the peaks of the great mountain above mentioned.\r\n\r\n“This mountain, which is considered to be the loftiest and greatest of\r\nthe snowy range in this quarter, and probably yields to none in the\r\nwhole Himalaya, obtains the name of Roodroo Himala, and is held to be\r\nthe throne or residence of Mahadeo himself. It is also indiscriminately\r\ncalled Pauch Purbut, from its five peaks, and Soomeroo Purbot, which is\r\nnot to be confounded with the mountain so called near Bunderbouch; and\r\nsometimes the general appellation of Kylas is given, which literally\r\nsignifies any snowy hill, but is applied to this mountain by way of\r\npreëminence. It has five principal peaks, called Roodroo Himala,\r\nBurrumpooree, Bissenpooree, Oodgurre Kanta and Soorga Rounee. These form\r\na sort of semicircular hollow of very considerable extent, filled with\r\neternal snow, from the gradual dissolution of the lower parts of which\r\nthe principal part of the stream is generated: probably there may be\r\nsmaller hollows beyond the point to the right above Gungotree, which\r\nalso supply a portion.\r\n\r\n“Within the temple there are three images; one, that of Kali; and the\r\nelevated stone shelf on which they were placed was wet and soiled with\r\nthe offerings made; there was a peculiar smell, but I know not whence it\r\nproceeded. The place, as usual, was lighted by a small lamp: no daylight\r\nhad admittance. Just below the temple, on the river side, grew three\r\npoplar trees, and a few small larches; above there are the remains of a\r\nfine old silver fir-tree, which overshadows some of the caves and sheds.\r\nThe whole people also bathed, and contributed something to the\r\npriesthood; and it was a matter of serious importance, as well as of\r\ngreat joy to every one, that we had thus happily reached a place of such\r\nsupereminent sanctity: such, indeed, that the act of bathing here is\r\nsupposed to cleanse from every sin heretofore committed, and the\r\ndifficulty of which is so great, that few, except professional devotees,\r\never attempt reaching the holy place.\r\n\r\n“It is customary that those who have lost their father and mother, or\r\neither of these, shall be shaved at this spot; and it was curious to\r\nobserve the whimsical changes produced by the operation, which numbers\r\nunderwent. It appears also, that one chief ordinance was the going\r\nfrequently round the holy temple; and we particularly observed that\r\nthose who were noted as the greatest rogues were most forward in this\r\npious exercise: one man, in particular, who had been a notorious thief,\r\nwas unwearied in his perseverance.\r\n\r\n“Well, indeed, do they say, that Seeva has made these recesses which he\r\ninhabits, inaccessible to all but those whom true devotion leads to his\r\nshrine. That man must have been indeed strongly impelled by devotion,\r\nambition, or curiosity, who first explored the way to Gungotree. It were\r\nunavailing to inquire, and perhaps of little use, if known, to which of\r\nthese motives we owe the enterprise; but patience, perseverance, and\r\ncourage, must have been strongly united with it to lead him safely and\r\nsuccessfully through those awful cliffs, that would bar the way to most\r\nmen. Another omen of favor pointed out was, the increase of the river\r\nafter bathing, as at Jumnotree; and it is singular enough, that during\r\nthe time we remained here, I remarked several increases and decreases of\r\nthe water, without any obvious causes; but these may fairly be referred\r\nto the effects of sudden changes of temperature occurring frequently\r\namong the hills, and acting on the body of snow that feeds the river.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                           ASIATIC VOLCANOES.\r\n\r\nAmong the Asiatic burning mountains, a brief account of which we\r\nintroduce after the above interesting notice of the grand Himalaya\r\nchain, those of Japan are both remarkable and numerous. On the summit of\r\na mountain in the province of Figo, is a large cavern, formerly the\r\nmouth of a volcano, but the flame of which has ceased, probably for want\r\nof combustible matter. In the same province, near a religious structure\r\ncalled the Temple of the Jealous God of Aso, a perpetual flame issues\r\nfrom the top of a mountain. In the province of Tsickusen is another\r\nburning mountain, where was formerly a coal-pit, which having been set\r\non fire by the carelessness of the workmen, has been burning ever since.\r\nSometimes a black smoke, accompanied by a very disagreeable stench, is\r\nobserved to issue from the summit of a famous mountain called Fesi, in\r\nthe province of Seruga. This mountain is said to be nearly as high as\r\nthe peak of Teneriffe, but in shape and beauty is supposed not to have\r\nan equal. Its top is covered with perpetual snow. Belonging to the\r\nJapanese cluster, and not far from Piranda, is a small rocky island,\r\nwhich has been burning and trembling for many centuries; and in another\r\nsmall island, opposite to Santzuma, is a volcano which has been burning\r\nat different intervals for many ages.\r\n\r\nCaptain Gore, when leaving Japan, passed by great quantities of\r\npumice-stone, several pieces of which were taken up, and found to weigh\r\nfrom one ounce to three pounds. It was conjectured that these stones had\r\nbeen thrown into the sea by eruptions at various times, as many of them\r\nwere covered by barnacles (small shells) and others were quite bare.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   VOLCANIC MOUNTAINS OF KAMTSCHATKA.\r\n\r\nThere are three burning mountains of Kamtschatka, which for many years\r\nhave thrown out a considerable smoke, but do not often burst into a\r\nflame. One of these is situated in the vicinity of Awatska; and another,\r\nnamed the volcano of Tolbatchiek, on a neck of land between the river\r\nKamtschatka and the Tolbatchiek. In the beginning of the year 1739, the\r\nflames issued with such violence from the crater, as to reduce to ashes\r\nthe forests on the neighboring mountains. This was succeeded by a cloud\r\nof smoke, which overspread and darkened the whole country, until it was\r\ndissipated by a shower of cinders, which covered the ground to the\r\ndistance of thirty miles. The third volcano is on the top of the\r\nparticular mountain of Kamtschatka, which is described as by far the\r\nhighest in the peninsula. It rises from two rows of hills, somewhat in\r\nthe form of a sugar-loaf, to a very great hight. It usually throws out\r\nashes twice or thrice a year, sometimes in such quantities, that for\r\nthree hundred versts, (one hundred and sixty-five English miles,) the\r\nearth is covered with them. In the year 1737, at the latter end of\r\nSeptember, a conflagration, which lasted for a week, was so violent and\r\nterrific, that the mountain appeared, to those who were fishing at sea,\r\nlike one red-hot rock; and the flames which burst through several\r\nopenings, with a dreadful noise, resembled rivers of fire. From the\r\ninside of the mountains were heard thunderings, crackings, and blasts\r\nlike those of the strongest bellows, shaking all the neighboring\r\nterritory. During the night it was most terrible; but at length the\r\nconflagration ended by the mountain’s casting forth a prodigious\r\nquantity of cinders and ashes, among which were porous stones, and glass\r\nof various colors. When Captain Clarke sailed out of the harbor of St.\r\nPeter and St. Paul, in June, 1778, to the northward, an eruption of the\r\nfirst of these volcanoes was observed. A rumbling noise, resembling\r\ndistant hollow thunder, was heard before daylight; and when the day\r\nbroke, the decks and sides of the ships were covered with a fine dust,\r\nresembling emery, nearly an inch thick, the air at the same time being\r\ncharged with this substance to such a degree, that toward the mountain,\r\nwhich is situated to the north of the harbor, the surrounding objects\r\nwere not to be distinguished. About twelve o’clock, and during the\r\nafternoon, the explosions became louder, and were followed by showers of\r\ncinders, which were in general about the size of peas, though many were\r\npicked up on the deck larger than a hazel-nut. Along with the cinders\r\nfell several small stones which had not undergone any change from the\r\naction of fire.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      VOLCANIC MOUNTAIN OF ALBAY.\r\n\r\nThe following details of the dreadful eruption of the volcano of Albay,\r\nin the island of Luconia, one of the Philippines, on the first of\r\nFebruary, 1814, are from an eye-witness of the dreadful scenes it\r\npresented.\r\n\r\n“During thirteen years the volcano of Albay had preserved a profound\r\nsilence. It was no longer viewed with that distrust and horror with\r\nwhich volcanoes usually inspire those who inhabit the vicinity. Its\r\nextensive and spacious brow had been converted into highly cultivated\r\nand beautiful gardens. On the first day of January last, no person\r\nreflected, in the slightest degree, upon the damages and losses which so\r\nbad a neighbor had once occasioned. Previously to the former eruptions\r\nthere had been heard certain subterraneous sounds, which were presages\r\nof them. But upon the present occasion we remarked nothing, except that\r\non the last day of January we perceived some slight shocks. In the night\r\nthe shocks increased. At two in the morning one was felt more violent\r\nthan those hitherto experienced. It was repeated at four, and from that\r\ntime they were almost continual until the eruption commenced.\r\n\r\n“The day broke, and I scarcely ever remarked in Camarines a more serene\r\nand pleasant morning. I observed, however, that the ridges nearest to\r\nthe volcano were covered with mist, which I supposed to be the smoke of\r\nsome house that might have been on fire in the night. But at eight\r\no’clock the volcano began suddenly to emit a thick column of stones,\r\nsand, and ashes, which with the greatest velocity, was elevated into the\r\nhighest regions of the atmosphere. At this sight we were filled with the\r\nutmost dread, especially when we observed that in an instant the brow of\r\nthe volcano was quite covered. We had never seen a similar eruption, but\r\nwere convinced that a river of fire was flowing toward us, and was about\r\nto consume us. The first thing which was done in my village was to\r\nsecure some things esteemed sacred, and then we betook ourselves to\r\nflight. The swiftness with which the dreadful tide rolled toward us, did\r\nnot give us time either for reflection or consultation. The frightful\r\nnoise of the volcano caused great terror even in the stoutest hearts. We\r\nall ran, filled with dismay and consternation, endeavoring to reach the\r\nhighest and most distant places, to preserve ourselves from so imminent\r\na danger. The horizon began to darken, and our anxieties redoubled. The\r\nnoise of the volcano continually increased, the darkness augmented, and\r\nwe continued our flight. But, notwithstanding our swiftness, we were\r\novertaken by a heavy shower of huge stones, by the violence of which\r\nmany unfortunate persons were in a moment killed. This cruel\r\ncircumstance obliged us to make a pause in our career, and to shelter\r\nourselves under the houses; but the flames and burnt stones which fell\r\nfrom above, in a short time reduced them to ashes.\r\n\r\n“The sky was now completely overcast, and we remained enveloped and\r\nimmersed in a thick and palpable darkness. From that moment reflection\r\nwas at an end. The mother abandoned her children, the husband his wife,\r\nand the children forgot their parents.\r\n\r\n“In the houses we had no longer any shelter. It was necessary to\r\nabandon, or perish with them; yet, to go out uncovered, was to expose\r\none’s self to a danger not less imminent, because many of the stones\r\nwere of an enormous size; and they fell as thick as drops of rain. It\r\nwas necessary to defend ourselves as well as we could. Some covered\r\nthemselves with hides, others with tables and chairs, and others with\r\nboards and tea-trays. Many took refuge in the trunks of trees, others\r\namong the canes and hedges, and some hid themselves in a cave, where the\r\nbrow of a mountain protected them.\r\n\r\n“About ten o’clock the heavy stones ceased to fall, and a rain of thick\r\nsand succeeded. At half past one the noise of the volcano began to\r\ndiminish, and the horizon to clear a little; and at two it became quite\r\ntranquil; and we now began to perceive the dreadful ravages which the\r\ndarkness had hitherto concealed from us. The ground was covered with\r\ndead bodies, part of whom had been killed by the stones, and the others\r\nconsumed by the fire. Two hundred perished in the church of Budiao, and\r\nthirty-five in a single house in that village. The joy the living felt\r\nat having preserved themselves, was in many converted into the extremity\r\nof sorrow at finding themselves deprived of their relations and friends.\r\nFathers found their children dead, husbands their wives, and wives their\r\nhusbands, in the village of Budiao, where there were very few who had\r\nnot lost some of their nearest connections. In other places we found\r\nmany persons extended upon the ground, wounded or bruised in a thousand\r\nways. Some with their legs broken, some without arms, some with their\r\nskulls fractured, and others covered with wounds. Many died immediately,\r\nothers on the following days, and the rest were abandoned to the most\r\nmelancholy fate, without physicians, without medicines, and in want even\r\nof necessary food.\r\n\r\n“Five populous towns were entirely destroyed by the eruption; more than\r\ntwelve hundred of the inhabitants perished amidst the ruins; and twenty\r\nthousand who survived the awful catastrophe, were stripped of their\r\npossessions and reduced to beggary.\r\n\r\n“The subsequent appearance of the volcanic mountain was most melancholy\r\nand terrific. Its side, formerly so well cultivated, and which afforded\r\na prospect the most picturesque, is now become a barren sand. The\r\nstones, sand and ashes, which cover it, in some places exceed the depth\r\nof ten and twelve yards; and on the ground where lately stood the\r\nvillage of Budiao, there are spots in which the cocoa-trees are almost\r\ncovered. In the ruined villages, and through the whole extent of the\r\neruption, the ground remains buried in the sand to the depth of half a\r\nyard, and scarcely a single tree is left alive. The crater of the\r\nvolcano has lowered more than one hundred and twenty feet; and the south\r\nside discovers a spacious and horrid mouth, which is frightful to the\r\nview. Three new ones have opened at a considerable distance from the\r\nprincipal crater, through which also smoke and ashes are incessantly\r\nemitted. In short, the most beautiful villages of Camarines, and the\r\nprincipal part of that fine province, are deeply covered with barren\r\nsand.”\r\n\r\n                 ISLANDS WHICH HAVE RISEN FROM THE SEA.\r\n\r\nBesides the convulsions of nature displayed in volcanoes, the most\r\nremarkable particulars of which we have given in our history of\r\nmountains, other operations are carried on below the fathomless depths\r\nof the sea, the nature of which can only be conjectured by the effects\r\nproduced. Nor is it more astonishing that inflammable substances should\r\nbe found beneath the bottom of the sea, than at similar depths on land,\r\nand that there also the impetuous force of fire should cause the\r\nimprisoned air and elastic gases to expand, and, by its mighty force,\r\nshould drive the earth at the bottom of the sea above its surface. These\r\nmarine volcanoes are perhaps more frequent, though they do not so often\r\ncome within the reach of human observation, as those on land; and\r\nstupendous must be the operations carried on, when matter is thrown up\r\nto an extent which the ingenuity of man does not enable him to reach by\r\nfathoming.\r\n\r\nMany instances have occurred, as well in ancient as in modern times, of\r\nislands having been formed in the midst of the sea; and their sudden\r\nappearance has constantly been preceded by violent agitations of the\r\nsurrounding waters, accompanied by dreadful noises, and in some\r\ninstances by fiery eruptions from the newly formed isles, which are\r\ncomposed of various substances, frequently intermixed with a\r\nconsiderable quantity of volcanic lava. Such islands remain for ages\r\nbarren, but in a long course of time become abundantly fruitful. It is a\r\nmatter of curious inquiry, whether springs are found on such newly\r\ncreated spots, when the convulsions which gave them birth have subsided;\r\nbut on this point it would seem that we are not possessed of any certain\r\ninformation, as it does not appear that they have been visited by any\r\nnaturalist with the express view of recording their properties.\r\n\r\nAmong the writers of antiquity who have transmitted accounts of islands\r\nwhich have thus started up to the view of the astonished spectator,\r\nSeneca asserts that, in his time, the island of Therasea, in the Egean\r\nsea, was seen to rise in this manner by several mariners, who were\r\nsailing near the point of its ascent. Pliny’s relation is still more\r\nextraordinary; for he says that in the Mediterranean, thirteen islands\r\nemerged at once from the sea, the cause of which he ascribes rather to\r\nthe retiring of the waters, than to any subterraneous operation of\r\nnature: but he speaks at the same time of the island of Hiera, in the\r\nvicinity of Therasea, as having been formed by subterraneous explosions,\r\nand enumerates several others said to have been derived from a similar\r\norigin, in one of which he says, a great abundance of fishes were found,\r\nof which, however, all who ate, perished soon afterward.\r\n\r\nIt is to the Grecian archipelago, and the Azores, or Western isles, that\r\nwe are to look for the grandest and most surprising instances of this\r\nphenomenon. We will select an example from each of these groups of\r\nislands, beginning with the latter.\r\n\r\nIn December, 1720, a violent earthquake was felt on the island of\r\nTercera, one of the Azores. And on the following morning, a new island,\r\nwhich had sprung up in the night, made its appearance, and a huge column\r\nof smoke was seen rising from it. The pilot of a ship which attempted to\r\napproach it, sounded on one of these newly formed islands, with a line\r\nof sixty fathoms, but could not find a bottom. On the opposite side, the\r\nsea was deeply tinged with various colors, white, blue and green; and\r\nwas very shallow. This island was larger on its first appearance than at\r\nsome distance of time afterward; it at length sunk beneath the level of\r\nthe sea, and is now no longer visible.\r\n\r\nWhat can be more surprising than to see fire, not only force its way out\r\nof the bowels of the earth, but likewise make for itself a passage\r\nthrough the waters of the sea! What can be more extraordinary, or\r\nforeign to our common notions of things, than to observe the bottom of\r\nthe sea rise up in a mountain above its surface, and become so firm an\r\nisland as to be able to resist the violence of the greatest storms! We\r\nknow that subterraneous fires, when pent up in a narrow passage, are\r\nable to elevate a mass of earth as large as an island; but that this\r\nshould be done in so regular and precise a manner, that the water of the\r\nsea should not be able to penetrate and extinguish those fires; and\r\nthat, after they should have exhausted themselves, the mass of earth\r\nshould not fall down, or sink again with its own weight, but still\r\nremain in a manner suspended over the great arch below; this seems more\r\nsurprising than any of the facts which have been related of Mount Etna,\r\nVesuvius, or any other volcano.\r\n\r\nIn the first part of the Transactions of the Royal Society for the year\r\n1812, Captain Tillard, of the British navy, has published a very\r\ninteresting narrative of a similar phenomenon, which occurred in the\r\nsame sea near the Azores. We give this narrative in his own words.\r\n\r\n“Approaching the island of St. Michael’s, on Sunday, the twelfth of\r\nJune, 1811, in his majesty’s sloop Sabrina, under my command, we\r\noccasionally observed, rising in the horizon, two or three columns of\r\nsmoke, such as would have been occasioned by an action between two\r\nships, to which cause we universally attributed its origin. This opinion\r\nwas, however, in a very short time changed, from the smoke increasing\r\nand ascending in much larger bodies than could possibly have been\r\nproduced by such an event; and having heard an account, prior to our\r\nsailing from Lisbon, that in the preceding January or February, a\r\nvolcano had burst out within the sea near St. Michael’s, we immediately\r\nconcluded that the smoke we saw proceeded from that cause, and, on our\r\nanchoring the next morning in the road of Ponta del Gada, we found this\r\nconjecture correct as to the cause, but not as to the time; the eruption\r\nof January having totally subsided, and the present one having only\r\nburst forth two days prior to our approach, and about three miles\r\ndistant from the one before alluded to.\r\n\r\n“Desirous of examining as minutely as possible a contention so\r\nextraordinary between two such powerful elements, I set off from the\r\ncity of Ponta del Gada on the morning of the fourteenth, in company with\r\nMr. Read, the consul-general of the Azores, and two other gentlemen.\r\nAfter riding about twenty miles across the north-west end of the island\r\nof St. Michael’s, we came to the edge of the cliff, whence the volcano\r\nburst suddenly upon our view in the most terrific and awful grandeur.\r\n[See cut, page 122.] It was only a short mile from the base of the\r\ncliff, which was nearly perpendicular, and formed the margin of the sea;\r\nthis cliff being, as nearly as I could judge, from three to four hundred\r\nfeet high. To give you an adequate idea of the scene by description, is\r\nfar beyond my powers; but for your satisfaction, I shall attempt it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ST. MICHAEL’S VOLCANO.]\r\n\r\n“Imagine an immense body of smoke rising from the sea, the surface of\r\nwhich was marked by the slippery rippling of the waves, occasioned by\r\nthe light and steady breezes incidental to these climates in summer. In\r\na quiescent state, it had the appearance of a circular cloud revolving\r\non the water like a horizontal wheel, in various and irregular\r\ninvolutions, expanding itself gradually on the lee side, when suddenly a\r\ncolumn of the blackest cinders, ashes and stones would shoot up in the\r\nform of a spire, at an angle of from ten to twenty degrees from a\r\nperpendicular line, the angle of inclination being universally to\r\nwindward; this was rapidly succeeded by a second, third and fourth\r\nshower, each acquiring greater velocity, and overtopping the other till\r\nthey had attained an altitude as much above the level of our eye, as the\r\nsea was below it.\r\n\r\n“As the impetus with which the columns were severally propelled\r\ndiminished, and their ascending motion had nearly ceased, they broke\r\ninto various branches resembling a group of pines; these again forming\r\nthemselves into festoons of white feathery smoke, in the most fanciful\r\nmanner imaginable, intermixed with the finest particles of falling\r\nashes, which at one time assumed the appearance of innumerable plumes of\r\nblack and white ostrich feathers, surmounting each other, and another,\r\nthat of the light wavy branches of a weeping-willow.\r\n\r\n“During these bursts, the most vivid flashes of lightning continually\r\nissued from the densest part of the volcano; and the cloud of smoke, now\r\nascending to an altitude much above the highest point to which the ashes\r\nwere projected, rolled off in large masses of fleecy clouds, gradually\r\nexpanding themselves before the wind in a direction nearly horizontal,\r\nand drawing up to them a quantity of water-spouts, which formed a most\r\nbeautiful and striking addition to the general appearance of the scene.\r\n\r\n“That part of the sea where the volcano was situated, was upward of\r\nthirty fathoms deep, and at the time of our viewing it the volcano was\r\nonly four days old. Soon after our arrival on the cliff, a peasant\r\nobserved he could discern a peak above the water: we looked but could\r\nnot see it; however, in less than half an hour it was plainly visible,\r\nand before we quitted the place, which was about three hours from the\r\ntime of our arrival, a complete crater was formed above the water, not\r\nless than twenty feet high on the side where the greatest quantity of\r\nashes fell; the diameter of the crater being apparently about four or\r\nfive hundred feet.\r\n\r\n“The great eruptions were generally attended with a noise like the\r\ncontinued firing of cannon and musketry intermixed, as also with slight\r\nshocks of earthquakes; several of which having been felt by my\r\ncompanions, but none by myself, I had become half skeptical, and thought\r\ntheir opinion arose merely from the force of imagination; but while we\r\nwere sitting within five or six yards of the edge of the cliff,\r\npartaking of a slight repast which had been brought with us, and were\r\nall busily engaged, one of the most magnificent bursts took place which\r\nwe had yet witnessed, accompanied by a very severe shock of an\r\nearthquake. The instantaneous and involuntary movement of each was to\r\nspring upon his feet; and I said, ‘This admits of no doubt.’ The words\r\nhad scarcely passed my lips, before we observed a large portion of the\r\nface of the cliff, about fifty yards on our left, falling, which it did\r\nwith a violent crash. So soon as our first consternation had a little\r\nsubsided, we removed about ten or a dozen yards further from the edge of\r\nthe cliff, and finished our dinner.\r\n\r\n“On the succeeding day, June fifteenth, having the consul and some other\r\nfriends on board, I weighed, and proceeded with the ship toward the\r\nvolcano, with the intention of witnessing a night view; but in this\r\nexpectation we were greatly disappointed, from the wind freshening, and\r\nthe weather becoming thick and hazy, and also from the volcano itself\r\nbeing more quiescent than it was the preceding day. It seldom emitted\r\nany lightning, but occasionally as much flame as may be seen to issue\r\nfrom the top of a glass-house or foundry chimney. On passing directly\r\nunder the great cloud of smoke, about three or four miles distant from\r\nthe volcano, the decks of the ship were covered with fine black ashes,\r\nwhich fell intermixed with small rain. We returned the next morning, and\r\nlate on the evening of the same day I took leave of St. Michael’s, to\r\ncomplete my cruise.\r\n\r\n“On the opening of the volcano clear of the north-west part of the\r\nisland, after dark on the sixteenth, we witnessed one or two eruptions\r\nthat, had the ship been near enough, would have been awfully grand. It\r\nappeared one continued blaze of lightning; but its distance from the\r\nship, upward of twenty miles, prevented our seeing it with effect.\r\nReturning again toward St. Michael’s, on the fourth of July, I was\r\nobliged, by the state of the wind, to pass with the ship very close to\r\nthe island, which was now completely formed by the volcano, being nearly\r\nthe hight of Matlock High Tor, about eighty yards above the sea. At this\r\ntime it was perfectly tranquil; which circumstance determined me to\r\nland, and explore it more narrowly. I left the ship in one of the boats,\r\naccompanied by some of the officers. As we approached we perceived that\r\nit was still smoking in many parts, and, upon our reaching the island,\r\nfound the surf on the beach very high. Rowing round to the lee-side,\r\nwith some little difficulty, by the aid of an oar as a pole, I jumped on\r\nshore, and was followed by the other officers. We found a narrow beach\r\nof black ashes, from which the side of the island rose in general too\r\nsteep to admit of our ascending; and where we could have clambered up,\r\nthe mass of matter was much too hot to allow our proceeding more than a\r\nfew yards in the ascent.\r\n\r\n“The declivity below the surface of the sea was equally steep, having\r\nseven fathoms of water at scarcely the boat’s length from the shore, and\r\nat the distance of twenty or thirty yards we sounded twenty-five\r\nfathoms. From walking round it in about twelve minutes, I should judge\r\nthat it was something less than a mile in circumference; but the most\r\nextraordinary part was the crater, the mouth of which, on the side\r\nfacing St. Michael’s, was nearly level with the sea. It was filled with\r\nwater, at that time boiling, and was emptying itself into the sea by a\r\nsmall stream about six yards over, and by which I should suppose it was\r\ncontinually filled again at high water. This stream, close to the edge\r\nof the sea, was so hot, as only to admit the finger to be dipped\r\nsuddenly in, and taken out again immediately.\r\n\r\n“It appeared evident, by the formation of this part of the island, that\r\nthe sea had, during the eruptions, broken into the crater in two places,\r\nas the east side of the small stream was bounded by a precipice; a cliff\r\nbetween twenty and thirty feet high, forming a peninsula of about the\r\nsame dimension in width, and from fifty to sixty feet long, connected\r\nwith the other part of the island by a narrow ridge of cinders and lava,\r\nas an isthmus, of from forty to fifty feet in length, from which the\r\ncrater rose in the form of an amphitheater.\r\n\r\n“This cliff, at two or three miles’ distance from the island, had the\r\nappearance of a work of art, resembling a small fort or block-house. The\r\ntop of this we were determined, if possible, to attain; but the\r\ndifficulty we had to encounter in doing so, was considerable: the only\r\nway to attempt it was up the side of the isthmus, which was so steep\r\nthat the only mode by which we could effect it, was by fixing the end of\r\nan oar at the base, with the assistance of which we forced ourselves up\r\nin nearly a backward direction.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SABRINA ISLAND.]\r\n\r\n“Having reached the summit of the isthmus, we found another difficulty:\r\nfor it was impossible to walk upon it, as the descent on the other side\r\nwas immediate, and as steep as the one we had ascended; but by throwing\r\nour legs across it, as would be done on the ridge of a house, and moving\r\nourselves forward by our hands, we at length reached that part of it\r\nwhere it gradually widened itself, and formed the summit of the cliff,\r\nwhich we found to have a perfectly flat surface, of the dimensions\r\nbefore stated. Judging this to be the most conspicuous situation, we\r\nhere planted the union, and left a bottle sealed up, containing a short\r\naccount of the origin of the island, and of our having landed upon it,\r\nand naming it Sabrina island.\r\n\r\n“Within the crater I found the complete skeleton of a guard-fish, the\r\nbones of which, being perfectly burnt, fell to pieces upon attempting to\r\ntake them up; and, by the account of the inhabitants on the coast of St.\r\nMichael’s, great numbers of fish had been destroyed during the early\r\npart of the eruption, as large quantities, probably suffocated or\r\npoisoned, were occasionally found drifted into the small inlets or bays.\r\nThe island, like other volcanic productions, is composed principally of\r\nporous substances, generally burnt to complete cinders, with occasional\r\nmasses of a stone, which I should suppose to be a mixture of iron and\r\nlimestone.”\r\n\r\nSabrina island has gradually disappeared, since the month of October,\r\n1811, leaving an extensive shoal. Smoke was discovered still issuing out\r\nof the sea in the month of February, 1812, near the spot where this\r\nwonderful phenomenon appeared.\r\n\r\nHaving thus spoken of the Azores, we now pass to some similar phenomena\r\nin the Grecian archipelago. Before entering, however, on the details\r\nwhich are here furnished on this curious and most interesting subject,\r\nit may not be improper to observe, that the island of Acroteri, of great\r\ncelebrity in ancient history, appears to have its surface composed of\r\npumice-stone, incrusted by a surface of fertile earth; and that it is\r\nrepresented by the ancients as having risen, during a violent\r\nearthquake, from the sea. Four neighboring islands are described as\r\nhaving a similar origin, notwithstanding the sea is in that part of the\r\narchipelago of such a depth as to be unfathomable by any sounding line.\r\nThese arose at different times: the first long before the commencement\r\nof the Christian era; the second in the first century; the third in the\r\neighth; and the fourth in 1573.\r\n\r\nWe now proceed to a phenomenon of a similar nature, belonging to the\r\nsame cluster of islands, which being of a more recent date, we are\r\nenabled to enter into all its particulars. They are such as can not fail\r\nto interest and surprise.\r\n\r\nOn the twenty-second of May, 1707, a severe earthquake was felt at\r\nStanchio, an island of the archipelago; and on the ensuing morning a\r\nparty of seamen, discovering not far off what they believed to be a\r\nwreck, rapidly rowed toward it; but finding rocks and earth instead of\r\nthe remains of a ship, hastened back, and spread the news of what they\r\nhad seen, in Santorini, another of these islands. However great the\r\napprehensions of the inhabitants were at the first sight, their surprise\r\nsoon abated, and in a few days, seeing no appearance of fire or smoke,\r\nsome of them ventured to land on the new island. Their curiosity led\r\nthem from rock to rock, where they found a kind of white stone, which\r\nyielded to the knife like bread, and nearly resembled that substance in\r\ncolor and consistence. They also found many oysters sticking to the\r\nrocks: but while they were employed in collecting them, the island moved\r\nand shook under their feet, on which they ran with precipitation to\r\ntheir boats. Amid these motions and tremblings the island increased, not\r\nonly in hight, but in length and breadth: still occasionally, while it\r\nwas raised and extended on the one side, it sunk and diminished on the\r\nother. One person observed a rock to rise out of the sea, forty or fifty\r\npaces from the island, which, having been thus visible for four days,\r\nsunk, and appeared no more: several others appeared and disappeared\r\nalternately, till at length they remained fixed and unmoved. In the mean\r\ntime the color of the surrounding sea was changed: at first it was of a\r\nlight green, then reddish, and afterward of a pale yellow, accompanied\r\nby a noisome stench, which spread itself over a part of the island of\r\nSantorini.\r\n\r\nOn the sixteenth of July, smoke first appeared, not indeed on the\r\nisland, but issuing from a ridge of black stones which suddenly rose\r\nabout sixty paces from it, where the depth of the sea was unfathomable.\r\nThus there were two separate islands, one called the White, and the\r\nother the Black island, from the different appearances they exhibited.\r\nThis thick smoke was of a whitish color, like that of a lime-kiln, and\r\nwas carried by the wind to Santorini, where it penetrated the houses of\r\nthe inhabitants.\r\n\r\nIn the night between the nineteenth and twentieth of July, flames began\r\nto issue with the smoke, to the great terror of the inhabitants of\r\nSantorini, especially of those occupying the castle of Scaro, who were\r\ndistant about a mile and a half only from the burning island, which now\r\nincreased very fast, large rocks daily springing up, which sometimes\r\nadded to its length, and sometimes to its breadth. The smoke, also\r\nincreased, and there not being any wind, ascended so high as to be seen\r\nat Candia, and other distant islands. During the night, it resembled a\r\ncolumn of five, fifteen, or twenty feet in hight; and the sea was then\r\ncovered with a scurf or froth, in some places reddish, and in others\r\nyellowish, from which proceeded such a stench, that the inhabitants\r\nthroughout the whole island of Santorini burnt perfumes in their houses,\r\nand made fires in the streets, to prevent infection. This, indeed, did\r\nnot last above a day or two; for a strong gale of wind dispersed the\r\nfroth, but drove the smoke on the vineyards of Santorini, by which the\r\ngrapes were, in one night, parched up and destroyed. This smoke also\r\ncaused violent head-aches, attended with retchings.\r\n\r\nOn the thirty-first of July, the sea smoked and bubbled in two different\r\nplaces near the island, where the water formed a perfect circle, and\r\nlooked like oil when beginning to simmer. This continued above a month,\r\nduring which time many fishes were found dead on the shore of Santorini.\r\nOn the following night a dull hollow noise was heard, like the distant\r\nreport of several cannon, which was instantly followed by flames of\r\nfire, shooting up to a great hight in the air, where they suddenly\r\ndisappeared. The next day the same hollow sound was several times heard,\r\nand succeeded by a blackish smoke, which, notwithstanding a fresh gale\r\nblew at the time, rose up to a prodigious hight, in the form of a\r\ncolumn, and would probably in the night have appeared as if on fire.\r\n\r\nOn the seventh of August, a different noise was heard, resembling that\r\nof large stones thrown, at very short intervals, into a deep well. This\r\nnoise, having lasted for some days, was succeeded by another much\r\nlouder, so nearly resembling thunder, as scarcely to be distinguished\r\nfrom three or four real claps, which were heard at the same time.\r\n\r\nOn the twenty-first, the fire and smoke were very considerably\r\ndiminished; but the next morning they broke out with still greater fury\r\nthan before. The smoke was red, and very thick, the heat at the same\r\ntime being so intense, that all around the island the sea smoked and\r\nbubbled surprisingly. At night, by the means of a telescope, sixty small\r\nopenings or funnels, all emitting a very bright flame, were discovered\r\non the highest part of the island, conjointly resembling a large\r\nfurnace; and on the other side of the great volcano there appeared to be\r\nas many.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the twenty-third, the island was much higher than on\r\nthe preceding day, and its breadth increased by a chain of rocks which\r\nhad sprung up in the night nearly fifty feet above the water. The sea\r\nwas also again covered with reddish froth, which always appeared when\r\nthe island seemed to have received any considerable additions, and\r\noccasioned an intolerable stench, until it was dispersed by the wind and\r\nthe motion of the waves.\r\n\r\nOn the fifth of September, the fire opened another vent at the extremity\r\nof the Black island, from which it issued for several days. During that\r\ntime little was discharged from the large furnace; but from this new\r\npassage the astonished spectator beheld the fire dart up three several\r\ntimes to a vast hight, resembling so many prodigious sky-rockets of a\r\nglowing, lively red. The following night the sub-aqueous fire made a\r\nterrible noise, and immediately, after a thousand sheaves of fire darted\r\ninto the air, where breaking and dispersing, they fell like a shower of\r\nstars on the island, which appeared in a blaze, presenting to the amazed\r\nspectator at once a most dreadful and beautiful illumination. To these\r\nnatural fire-works, succeeded a kind of meteor, which for some time hung\r\nover the castle of Scaro, and which, having a resemblance to a flaming\r\nsword, served to increase the consternation of the inhabitants of\r\nSantorini.\r\n\r\nOn the ninth of September, the White and Black islands united; after\r\nwhich the western end of the island grew daily in bulk. There were now\r\nfour openings only which emitted flames; these issued forth with great\r\nimpetuosity, sometimes attended with a noise like that of a large\r\norgan-pipe, and sometimes like the howling of wild beasts.\r\n\r\nOn the twelfth, the subterraneous noise was much augmented, having never\r\nbeen so frequent or so dreadful as on that and the following day. The\r\nbursts of this subterraneous thunder, like a general discharge of the\r\nartillery of an army, were repeated ten or twelve times within\r\ntwenty-four hours, and, immediately after each clap, the large furnace\r\nthrew up huge red-hot stones, which fell into the sea at a great\r\ndistance. These claps were always followed by a thick smoke, which\r\nspread clouds of ashes over the sea and the neighboring islands.\r\n\r\nOn the eighteenth of September, an earthquake was felt at Santorini. It\r\ndid but little damage, although it considerably enlarged the burning\r\nisland, and in several places gave vent to the fire and smoke. The claps\r\nwere also more terrible than ever; and, in the midst of a thick smoke,\r\nwhich appeared like a mountain, large pieces of rock, which afterward\r\nfell on the island, or into the sea, were thrown up with as much noise\r\nand force as balls from the mouth of a cannon. One of the small\r\nneighboring islands was covered with these fiery stones, which being\r\nthinly crusted over with sulphur, gave a bright light, and continued\r\nburning until that was consumed.\r\n\r\nOn the twenty-first, a dreadful clap of subterraneous thunder was\r\nfollowed by very powerful lightnings, and at the same instant the new\r\nisland was so violently shaken, that part of the great furnace fell\r\ndown, and huge burning rocks were thrown to the distance of two miles\r\nand upward. This seemed to be the last effort of the volcano, and\r\nappeared to have exhausted the combustible matter, as all was quiet for\r\nseveral days after: but on the twenty-fifth, the fire broke out again\r\nwith still greater fury, and among the claps one was so terrible, that\r\nthe churches of Santorini were soon filled with crowds of people,\r\nexpecting every moment to be their last; and the castle and town of\r\nScaro suffered such a shock, that the doors and windows of the houses\r\nflew open. The volcano continued to rage during the remaining part of\r\nthe year; and in the month of January, 1708, the large furnace, without\r\none day’s intermission, threw out stones and flames, at least once or\r\ntwice, but generally five or six times a day.\r\n\r\nOn the tenth of February, in the morning, a pretty strong earthquake was\r\nfelt at Santorini, which the inhabitants considered as a prelude to\r\ngreater commotions in the burning island; nor were they deceived, for\r\nsoon after the fire and smoke issued in prodigious quantities. The\r\nthunder-like claps were redoubled, and all was horror and confusion:\r\nrocks of an amazing size were raised up to a great hight above the\r\nwater; and the sea raged and boiled to such a degree as to occasion\r\ngreat consternation. The subterraneous bellowings were heard without\r\nintermission, and sometimes in less than a quarter of an hour, there\r\nwere six or seven eruptions from the large furnace. The noise of\r\nrepeated claps, the quantity of huge stones which flew about on every\r\nside, the houses at Santorini tottering to their very foundations, and\r\nthe fire, which now appeared in open day, surpassed all that had\r\nhitherto happened, and formed a scene terrific and astonishing beyond\r\ndescription.\r\n\r\nThe fifteenth of April was rendered memorable by the number and violence\r\nof the bellowings and eruptions, by one of which nearly a hundred stones\r\nwere thrown at the same instant into the air, and fell again into the\r\nsea at about two miles distant. From that day until the twenty-second of\r\nMay, which may be considered as the anniversary of the birth of the new\r\nisland, things continued much in the same state, but afterward the fire\r\nand smoke subsided by degrees, and the subterraneous thunders became\r\nless terrible.\r\n\r\nOn the fifteenth of July, 1709, the Bishop of Santorini, accompanied by\r\nseveral friars, hired a boat to take a near view of the island. They\r\nmade directly toward it on that side where the sea did not bubble, but\r\nwhere it smoked very much. Being within the range of this vapor, they\r\nfelt a close, suffocating heat, and found the water very hot; on which\r\nthey directed their course toward a part of the island at the furthest\r\ndistance from the large furnace. The fires, which still continued to\r\nburn, and the boiling of the sea, obliged them to make a great circuit,\r\nnotwithstanding which they felt the air about them to be very hot and\r\nsultry. Having encompassed the island, and surveyed it carefully from an\r\nadjacent one, they judged it to be two hundred feet above the sea, about\r\na mile broad, and five miles in circumference; but, not being thoroughly\r\nsatisfied, they resolved to make an attempt at landing, and accordingly\r\nrowed toward that part of the island where they perceived neither fire\r\nnor smoke. When, however, they had proceeded to within the distance of a\r\nhundred yards, the great furnace discharged itself with its usual fury,\r\nand the wind blew upon them so dense a smoke, and so heavy a shower of\r\nashes, that they were obliged to abandon their design. Having retired\r\nsomewhat further, they let down their sounding lead, with a line\r\nninety-five fathoms in length, but it was too short to reach the bottom.\r\nOn their return to Santorini, they observed that the heat of the water\r\nhad melted the greater part of the pitch employed in calking their boat,\r\nwhich had now become very leaky.\r\n\r\nFrom that time until the fifteenth of August, the fire, smoke and noises\r\ncontinued, but not in so great a degree; and it appears that for several\r\nyears after, the island still increased, but that the fire and\r\nsubterraneous noises were much abated. The most recent account we have\r\nbeen enabled to collect, is that of a traveler, who, in 1811, passed\r\nthis island at some distance. It appeared to him like a stupendous mass\r\nof rock, but was not inhabited or cultivated. It had then long ceased to\r\nburn.\r\n\r\n\r\n              -------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n                         SUBTERRANEAN WONDERS.\r\n\r\n                  ------------------------------------\r\n\r\n                          THE GROTTA DEL CANE.\r\n\r\n           “Give me, ye powers, the wondrous scenes to show,\r\n           Concealed in darkness in the caves below.”\r\n\r\nAmong the various subterranean wonders of the world, which are worthy of\r\nspecial notice, we would first mention the “Grotta del Cane.” This name\r\nhas been given to a small cavern between Naples and Pozzuoli, on this\r\naccount, that if a dog be brought into it, and his nose held to the\r\nground, a difficulty of respiration instantly ensues, and he loses all\r\nsensation and even life, if he be not speedily removed into purer air.\r\nThere are other grottos endowed with the same deleterious quality,\r\nespecially in volcanic countries; and the pestiferous vapors they\r\nexhale, are quickly fatal both to animals and man, though they do not\r\noffer to the eye the slightest indication of their presence. These\r\nvapors are, however, for the greater part temporary; while that of the\r\nGrotta del Cane is perpetual, and seems to have produced its deadly\r\neffects even in the time of Pliny. A man standing erect within, does not\r\nsuffer from it, the mephitic vapor rising to a small hight only from the\r\nground. It may, therefore, be entered without danger.\r\n\r\nThe smoke of a torch extinguished in this vapor, or gas, sinks downward,\r\nassumes a whitish color, and passes out at the bottom of the door. The\r\nreason of this is, that the fumes which proceed from the torch mix more\r\nreadily with the gas than with the atmospherical air. It has been\r\nsupposed, that the mischievous effects of the vapor were the result of\r\nthe air being deprived of its elasticity; but it has been clearly\r\ndemonstrated by M. Adolphus Murray, that they are solely to be\r\nattributed to the existence of carbonic acid gas.\r\n\r\nThe person who is the keeper, or guide, at the grotto, and who shows to\r\nstrangers the experiment of the dog for a gratuity, takes the animal,\r\nwhen he is half dead and panting, into the open air, and then proceeds\r\nto throw him into the neighboring lake of Agnano, thus insinuating that\r\nthis short immersion in the water is necessary to his complete\r\nrestoration. This, however, is a mere trick, to render the experiment\r\nmore specious, and to obtain a handsome present from the credulous, the\r\natmospherical air alone sufficing for that purpose.\r\n\r\nThe celebrated naturalist, the Abbe Spallanzani, projected a regular\r\nseries of experiments on the mephitic vapor of this grotto, from a\r\npersuasion that they would tend to throw a new light on physiology and\r\nnatural philosophy. Being, however, prevented from undertaking this, by\r\nhis duties as a professor, his friend, the Abbe Breislak, who resided\r\nnear the spot, engaged in the task; and the following is an abstract of\r\nhis learned memoir on this subject.\r\n\r\nIt is well known, the abbe observes, that the mephitic vapor occupies\r\nthe floor of a small grotto near the lake Agnano, a place highly\r\ninteresting to naturalists from the phenomena its environs present, and\r\nthe hills within which it is included. This grotto is situated on the\r\nsouth-east side of the lake, at a little distance from it. Its length is\r\nabout twelve feet, and its breadth from four to five. It appears to have\r\nbeen originally a small excavation, made for the purpose of obtaining\r\npozzuolana, an earth which, being applied as mortar, becomes a powerful\r\ncement. In the sides of the grotto, among the earthy volcanic matters,\r\nare found pieces of lava, of the same kind with those which are met with\r\nscattered near the lake.\r\n\r\nThe abbe is persuaded that, if new excavations were to be made in the\r\nvicinity of the grotto, at a level with its floor, or a little lower,\r\nthe same mephitic vapor would be found; and thinks it would be curious\r\nto ascertain the limits of its extent. It would also be advantageous to\r\nphysical observations, if the grotto were to be somewhat enlarged, and\r\nits floor reduced to a level horizontal plane, by sinking it two or\r\nthree feet, and surrounding it by a low wall, with steps at the\r\nentrance. In its present state it is extremely inconvenient for\r\nexperiments, and the inclination of the ground toward the door causes a\r\ngreat part of the vapor, from the effect of its specific gravity, to\r\nmake its way out close to the ground.\r\n\r\nWhen the narrow limits of this place are considered, and the small\r\nquantity of the vapor which has rendered it so celebrated, there can not\r\nbe any doubt but that it has undergone considerable changes; since it\r\ndoes not appear probable that Pliny refers to the present confined vapor\r\nonly, when, in enumerating many places from which a deadly air exhaled,\r\nhe mentions the territory of Pozzuoli. The internal fermentations by\r\nwhich it is caused, are certainly much diminished in the vicinity of the\r\nlake Agnano. The water near its banks is no longer seen to bubble up,\r\nfrom the disengagement of a gas, as it appears from accounts, not of\r\nvery remote antiquity, to have done. The borders of the lake were\r\nattentively examined by the abbe, when its waters were at the highest,\r\nand after heavy rains; but he could never discover a single bubble of\r\nair. A number of aquatic insects which sport on the surface, may at\r\nfirst sight occasion some deception; but a slight observation soon\r\ndetects the error. If, therefore, we do not suppose those authors who\r\nhave described the ebullition of the water near the banks of the lake\r\nAgnano to have been deceived, it must at least be confessed, that this\r\nphenomenon has now ceased. The quantity of the sulphureous vapors which\r\nrise in the contiguous stoves, called the stoves of St. Germano, must\r\nlikewise be greatly diminished from what it anciently was: for,\r\nadjoining to the present stoves, we still find the remains of a spacious\r\nancient fabric, with tubes of _terra cotta_ inserted in the walls,\r\nwhich, by their direction, show for what purpose they were intended. It\r\nappears certain, that this was a building in which, by the means of\r\npipes properly disposed, the vapors of the place were introduced into\r\ndifferent rooms for the use of patients. To these ruins, however, the\r\nvapors no longer extend; so that, if this edifice had remained entire,\r\nit could not have been employed for the purpose for which it was\r\nintended. The veins of pyrites which produced the more ancient\r\nconflagrations of the Phlegrean fields, between Naples and Cuma, and\r\nwhich, in some places, are entirely consumed, approach their total\r\nextinction. We will now proceed to the experiments within the grotto.\r\n\r\nThe object of the first was to determine the hight of the mephitic vapor\r\nat the center of the grotto, that is, at the intersection of the line of\r\nits greatest length with that of its greatest breadth. The hight varies\r\naccording to the different dispositions and temperatures of the\r\natmosphere, the diversity of winds, and the accidental variations which\r\ntake place in the internal fermentations by which the vapor is produced.\r\nIt may, however, be estimated at a mean, at nearly nine English inches.\r\n\r\nThe second set of experiments regarded the degree of heat on entering\r\ninto the mephitis: it was slightly sensible in the feet and lower part\r\nof the legs; notwithstanding which, on taking out of the vapor several\r\nsubstances which had remained in it for a long time, such as stones,\r\nleaves, the carcasses of animals, &c., the abbe found that these were of\r\nthe same temperature with the atmospheric air. Feeling in his body a\r\nslight degree of heat, which he could not perceive in the substances\r\nremoved from the mephitic vapor, he was led by comparison to conclude,\r\nthat the temperature of the latter was the same with the atmospherical\r\nair, agreeably to the principles of Dr. Crauford. He was, however,\r\nmistaken; for in subsequent experiments, he found a very distinct degree\r\nof heat. He was now provided with a thermometer, his former one having\r\nbeen broken, and, having suspended it at the aperture of the grotto,\r\nthree feet above the surface of the vapor, found the mercury to stand at\r\nfrom sixty-two to sixty-four degrees of Fahrenheit; but, on placing the\r\nball on the ground so as to immerse it in the vapor, the mercury rose to\r\neighty, and even eighty-two degrees. That the substances taken out of\r\nthe mephitis did not exhibit this diversity of temperature, was, he\r\nthinks, owing to the quantity of humidity with which they are always\r\nloaded, and which produces on their surface a constant evaporation. He\r\nwas the more particular in repeating these experiments, because the\r\nnaturalists who had, before him, made similar ones in the Grotta del\r\nCane, had not observed the vapor to produce any effect on the mercury in\r\nthe thermometer.\r\n\r\nThirdly. He repeated for his own satisfaction, the usual experiments\r\nmade by naturalists, with the tincture of turnsole, lime-water, the\r\ncrystallizations of alkalies, the absorption of water, and the acidulous\r\ntaste communicated to it; which prove, beyond all doubt, the existence\r\nof fixed air, or carbonic acid gas, in the vapor of the grotto. He\r\nascertained that it was not formed of fixed air alone, as might have\r\nbeen conjectured; but that the relative quantities of the different\r\ngases which compose its mephitic air, are as follows: in one hundred\r\nparts there are ten of vital air, or oxygen gas; forty of fixed air, or\r\ncarbonic acid gas; and fifty of phlogisticated air, or azotic gas.\r\n\r\nFourthly. The phenomena of magnetism and electricity were investigated\r\nby the abbe in this grotto. With respect to the former, there was not\r\nany new appearance: the magnetic needle, being placed on the ground, and\r\nconsequently immersed in the mephitis, rested in the direction of its\r\nmeridian, and, at the approach of a magnetized bar, exhibited the usual\r\neffects of attraction and repulsion, in proportion as either pole was\r\npresented. As to the latter, electricity, it was impossible to make the\r\nexperiments within the mephitis, not because this kind of air is a\r\nconductor of the electric fluid, as has been imagined, but because the\r\nhumidity by which it is constantly accompanied, disperses the electric\r\nmatter; and this, not being collected in a conductor, can not be\r\nrendered sensible. He attempted several times to fire inflammable gas,\r\nwith electric sparks, in the mephitic vapor, by means of the conductor\r\nof the electrophus; but, notwithstanding his utmost endeavors to animate\r\nthe electricity, he could never obtain a single spark, the non-conductor\r\nbecoming a conductor the moment it entered into the mephitis, on account\r\nof the humidity which adhered to its surface.\r\n\r\nFifthly. His latest experiments were directed to the theory of the\r\ncombustion of bodies. He first endeavored to ascertain whether those\r\nspontaneous inflammations that result from the mixture of concentrated\r\nacids with essential oils, could be obtained within the grotto. He\r\nplaced on the ground a small vessel, in such a situation that the\r\nmephitis rose six inches above its edges, employing oil of turpentine,\r\nand the vitriolic and nitrous acids: the same inflammation, accompanied\r\nby a lively flame, followed, as would have taken place in the open\r\natmospheric air. The dense smoke which always accompanies these\r\ninflammations, being attracted by the humidity of the mephitis,\r\npresented its undulations to the eye, and formed a very pleasing object.\r\nAs he had put a considerable quantity of acid in the vessel, he\r\nrepeatedly poured in a little of the oil, and the flame appeared in the\r\nmouth of the vessel fifteen times successively. The oxygenous principle\r\ncontained in the acids, and with which the nitrous acid principally\r\nabounds, undoubtedly contributed to the production and duration of this\r\nflame, though enveloped in an atmosphere inimical to inflammation.\r\n\r\nThe abbe had, in the district of Latera, observed that in a mephitis of\r\nhydrogenous sulphurated or hepatic gas a slow combustion of phosphorus\r\ntook place, with the same resplendence as in the atmospheric air. On the\r\npresent occasion, his first experiment, in the mephitis of Agnano, was\r\nmade with common phosphoric matches, five of which he broke, holding\r\nthem to the ground, and consequently immersed in the mephitis. They\r\nproduced a short and transient flame, which became extinguished the\r\nmoment it was communicated to the wick of a candle. His second\r\nexperiment was as follows: he placed on the ground, within the grotto, a\r\nlong table, in such a manner that one extremity was without the\r\nmephitis, while the other, and four-fifths of its length, were immersed\r\nin it. Along this table he laid a train of gunpowder, beginning from the\r\nend without the mephitis; and, at the other end, which was immersed in\r\nit to the depth of seven inches, he placed, adjoining to the gunpowder,\r\na cylinder of phosphorus, eight lines in length. The gunpowder, without\r\nthe mephitis, being fired, the combustion was soon communicated to the\r\nother extremity of the train, and to the phosphorus, which took fire\r\nwith decrepitation, burned rapidly with a bright flame, slightly colored\r\nwith yellow and green, and left on the wood a black mark, as of\r\ncharcoal. The combustion lasted nearly two minutes, when the whole\r\nphosphoric matter was consumed.\r\n\r\nIn succeeding experiments not any alteration was perceptible in the\r\nflame, or manner of burning, of the lighted phosphorus, either at the\r\nmoment of its entrance into the mephitis, or during its continuance in\r\nit. When suddenly withdrawn, it ignited gunpowder equally well. Hence\r\nthe abbe deduces, that the mephitic gas of Grotta del Cane, however it\r\nmay be utterly unfit for the respiration of animals, and for the\r\ninflammation of common combustible substances, readily allows that of\r\nphosphorus, which not only burns in it, but emits, as usual, luminous\r\nsparks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GROTTO OF ANTIPAROS.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                          GROTTO OF ANTIPAROS.\r\n\r\nAntiparos, one of the Cyclades, is situated in the Egean sea, or Grecian\r\narchipelago. It is a small island, about sixteen miles in circumference,\r\nand lies two miles to the west of the celebrated Paros, from which\r\ncircumstance it derives its name, _anti_ in the Greek language\r\nsignifying _opposite to_. Its singular and most interesting grotto,\r\nthough so inferior in size to the cavern in Kentucky of which we shall\r\nsoon speak, has attracted the attention of an infinite number of\r\ntravelers. The entrance to this superb grotto is on the side of a rock,\r\nand is a large arch, formed of craggy stones, overhung with brambles and\r\ncreeping plants, which bestow on it a gloominess at once awful and\r\nagreeable. Having proceeded about thirty paces within it, the traveler\r\nenters a low, narrow alley, surrounded on every side by stones, which,\r\nby the light of torches, glitter like diamonds; the whole being covered\r\nand lined throughout with small crystals, which give by their different\r\nreflections, a variety of colors. At the end of this alley or passage,\r\nhaving a rope tied round his waist, he is led to the brink of an awful\r\nprecipice, and is thence lowered into a deep abyss, the gloom pervading\r\nwhich makes him regret the “alley of diamonds” he has just quitted. He\r\nhas not yet, however, reached the grotto, but is led forward about forty\r\npaces, beneath a roof of rugged rocks, amid a scene of terrible\r\ndarkness, and at a vast depth from the surface of the earth, to the\r\nbrink of another precipice, much deeper and more awful than the former.\r\n\r\nHaving descended this precipice, which is not accomplished without\r\nconsiderable difficulty, the traveler enters a passage, the grandeur and\r\nbeauty of which can be but imperfectly described. It is one hundred and\r\ntwenty feet in length, about nine feet high, and in width seven, with a\r\nbottom of a fine green glossy marble. The walls and arched roof are as\r\nsmooth and polished as if they had been wrought by art, and are composed\r\nof a fine glittering red and white granite, supported at intervals by\r\ncolumns of a deep blood-red shining porphyry, which, by the reflection\r\nof the lights, presents an appearance inconceivably grand. At the\r\nextremity of this passage is a sloping wall, formed of a single mass of\r\npurple marble, studded with sprigs of rock crystal, which, from the glow\r\nof the purple behind, appear like a continued range of amethysts.\r\n\r\nAnother slanting passage, filled with petrifactions, representing the\r\nfigures of snakes and other animals, and having toward its extremity two\r\npillars of beautiful yellow marble, which seem to support the roof,\r\nleads to the last precipice, which is descended by means of a ladder.\r\nThe traveler, who has descended to the depth of nearly fifteen hundred\r\nfeet beneath the surface, now enters the magnificent grotto, to procure\r\na sight of which he has endured so much fatigue. It is in width three\r\nhundred and sixty feet; in length three hundred and forty; and in most\r\nplaces one hundred and eighty in hight. By the aid of torch-light, he\r\nfinds himself beneath an immense and finely vaulted arch, overspread\r\nwith icicles of white shining marble, many of them ten feet in length,\r\nand of a proportionate thickness. Among these are suspended a thousand\r\nfestoons of leaves and flowers, of the same substance, but so glittering\r\nas to dazzle the sight. The sides are planted with petrifactions, also\r\nof white marble, representing trees; these rise in rows one above the\r\nother, and often inclose the points of the icicles. From them also hang\r\nfestoons, tied as it were one to another, in great abundance; and in\r\nsome places rivers of marble seem to wind through them. In short, these\r\npetrifactions, the result of the dripping of water for a long series of\r\nages, nicely resemble trees and brooks turned to marble. The floor is\r\npaved with crystals of different colors, such as red, blue, green and\r\nyellow, projecting from it, and rendering it rugged and uneven. These\r\nare again interspersed with icicles of white marble, which have\r\napparently fallen from the roof, and are there fixed. To these the\r\nguides fasten their torches; and the glare of splendor and beauty which\r\nresults from such an illumination, may be better conceived than\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\nTo the above description we subjoin an extract from the one given by Dr.\r\nClarke, a learned traveler, who visited this celebrated grotto.\r\n\r\n“The mode of descent is by ropes, which, on the different declivities,\r\nare either held by the guides, or are joined to a cable which is\r\nfastened at the entrance around a stalactite pillar. In this manner, we\r\nwere conducted, first down one declivity, and then down another, until\r\nwe entered the spacious chambers of this truly enchanted grotto. The\r\nroof, the floor, the sides, of a whole series of magnificent caverns,\r\nwere entirely invested with a dazzling incrustation as white as snow.\r\nColumns, some of which were five and twenty feet in length, pended in\r\nfine icicle forms above our heads: fortunately some of them are so far\r\nabove the reach of the numerous travelers, who during many ages, have\r\nvisited this place, that no one has been able to injure or remove them.\r\nOthers extended from the roof to the floor, with diameters equal to that\r\nof the mast of a first-rate ship of the line. The incrustations of the\r\nfloor, caused by falling drops from the stalactites above, had grown up\r\ninto dendritic and vegetable forms, which first suggested to Tournefort\r\nthe strange notion of his having here discovered the vegetation of\r\nstones. Vegetation itself has been considered as a species of\r\ncrystallization; and as the process of crystallization is so\r\nsurprisingly manifested by several phenomena in this grotto, some\r\nanalogy may perhaps be allowed to exist between the plant and the stone;\r\nbut it can not be said, that a principle of life existing in the former\r\nhas been imparted to the latter. The last chamber into which we\r\ndescended surprised us more by the grandeur of its exhibition than any\r\nother. Probably there are many other chambers below this, yet\r\nunexplored, for no attempt has been made to penetrate further: and, if\r\nthis be true, the new caverns, when opened, would appear in perfect\r\nsplendor, unsullied, in any part of them, by the smoke of torches, or by\r\nthe hands of intruders.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                    CAVERNS IN GERMANY AND HUNGARY,\r\n\r\n                        CONTAINING FOSSIL BONES.\r\n\r\nAmong the most remarkable of these caverns are those of Gaylenreuth, on\r\nthe confines of Bayreuth. The opening to these, which is about seven\r\nfeet and a half high, is at the foot of a rock of limestone of\r\nconsiderable magnitude, and in its eastern side. Immediately beyond the\r\nopening is a magnificent grotto, of about three hundred feet in\r\ncircumference, which has been naturally divided by the form of the roof\r\ninto four caves. The first is about twenty-five feet long and wide, and\r\nvaries in hight from nine to eighteen feet, the roof being formed into\r\nirregular arches. Beyond this is the second cave, about twenty-eight\r\nfeet long, and of nearly the same width and hight with the former.\r\n\r\nA low and very rugged passage, the roof of which is formed of projecting\r\npieces of rocks, leads to the third grotto, the opening into which is a\r\nhole three feet high, and four feet wide. This grotto is more regular in\r\nits form, and is about thirty feet in diameter, and nearly round; its\r\nhight is from five to six feet. It is very richly and fantastically\r\nadorned by the varying forms of its stalactitic hangings. The floor is\r\nalso covered with a wet and slippery glazing, in which several teeth and\r\njaws appear to have been fixed.\r\n\r\nFrom this grotto commences the descent to the inferior caverns. Within\r\nonly about five or six feet an opening in the floor is seen, which is\r\npartly vaulted over by a projecting piece of rock. The descent is about\r\ntwenty feet. This cavern is about thirty feet in hight, about fifteen\r\nfeet in width, and nearly circular; the sides, roof and floor,\r\ndisplaying the remains of animals. The rock itself is thickly beset with\r\nteeth and bones, and the floor is covered with a loose earth, the\r\nevident result of animal decomposition, and in which numerous bones are\r\nimbedded.\r\n\r\nA gradual descent leads to another grotto, which, with its passage, is\r\nforty feet in length, and twenty feet in hight. Its sides and top are\r\nbeautifully adorned with stalactites. Nearly twenty feet further is a\r\nfrightful gulf, the opening of which is about fifteen feet in diameter;\r\nand, upon descending about twenty feet, another grotto, about the same\r\ndiameter with the former, but forty feet in hight, is seen. Here the\r\nbones are dispersed about; and the floor, which is formed of animal\r\nearth, has great numbers of them imbedded in it. The bones which are\r\nhere found, seem to be of different animals; but in this, as well as in\r\nthe former caverns, perfect and unbroken bones are very seldom found.\r\nSometimes a tooth is seen projecting from the solid rock, through the\r\nstalactitic covering, showing that many of these wonderful remains may\r\nhere be concealed. A specimen of this kind has been preserved, and is\r\nrendered particularly interesting, by the first molar tooth of the lower\r\njaw, with its enamel quite perfect, rising through the stalactitic mass\r\nwhich invests the bone. In this cavern the stalactites begin to be of a\r\nlarger size, and of a more columnar form.\r\n\r\nPassing on through a narrow opening in the rock, a small cave, seven\r\nfeet long, and five feet high, is discovered; another narrow opening\r\nleads to another small cave; from which a sloping descent leads to a\r\ncave twenty-five feet in hight, and about half as much in its diameter,\r\nin which is a truncated columnar stalactite, eight feet in\r\ncircumference.\r\n\r\nA narrow and most difficult passage, twenty feet in length, leads from\r\nthis cavern to another, twenty-five feet in hight, which is everywhere\r\nbeset with teeth, bones and stalactitic projections. This cavern is\r\nsuddenly contracted, so as to form a vestibule of six feet wide, ten\r\nlong, and nine high, terminating in an opening close to the floor, only\r\nthree feet wide and two high, through which it is necessary to writhe,\r\nwith the body on the ground. This leads into a small cave, eight feet\r\nhigh and wide, which is the passage into a grotto, twenty-eight feet\r\nhigh, and about forty-three feet long and wide. Here the prodigious\r\nquantity of animal earth, the vast number of teeth, jaws and other\r\nbones, and the heavy grouping of the stalactites, produce so dismal an\r\nappearance, as to become a perfect model of a temple for a god of the\r\ndead. Here hundreds of cart-loads of bony remains might be removed,\r\npockets might be filled with fossil teeth, and animal earth was found to\r\nreach to the utmost depth to which the workmen dug. A piece of\r\nstalactite, being here broken down, was found to contain pieces of bones\r\nwithin it, the remnants of which were left imbedded in the rock. From\r\nthis principal cave is a very narrow passage, terminating in the last\r\ncave, which is about six feet in width, fifteen in hight, and the same\r\nin length. In this cave were no animal remains, and the floor was the\r\nnaked rock.\r\n\r\nThus far only can these natural sepulchers be traced; but there is every\r\nreason to suppose, that these animal remains are disposed through a\r\ngreater part of this rock. Whence this immense quantity of the remains\r\nof carnivorous animals could have been collected, is a question which\r\nnaturally arises; but the difficulty of answering it appears to be\r\nalmost insurmountable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE MAMMOTH CAVE.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                           THE MAMMOTH CAVE.\r\n\r\nFor one of the earliest accounts of this stupendous cavern, which is\r\nunparalleled in the entire history of subterranean wonders, we are\r\nindebted to Dr. Nahum Ward, who published it in a monthly magazine, in\r\nOctober, 1816. It is in what was formerly Warren, but now Edmonson\r\ncounty, in the state of Kentucky, about ten miles from the great\r\nLouisville and Nashville turnpike. The territory is not mountainous but\r\nbroken, differing in this respect from the vicinity of most other\r\ncaverns of the same general kind. Not far from the entrance, a hotel is\r\nnow kept for the accommodation of visitors, as the cave is quite a\r\nfashionable resort for travelers during the summer season. Perhaps we\r\nshall best gain correct ideas of this wonderful cavern, which is almost\r\na world in itself, having its own seas, mountains, lakes, rivers, &c.,\r\nby reading first the account given by Dr. Ward, and then that of a\r\nvisitor who explored it in 1854.\r\n\r\nDr. Ward, provided with guides, two large lamps, a compass and\r\nrefreshments, descended a pit forty feet in depth, and one hundred and\r\ntwenty in circumference; having a spring of fine water at the bottom,\r\nand conducting to the entrance of the cavern. The opening, which is to\r\nthe north, is from forty to fifty feet high, and about thirty in width.\r\nIt narrows shortly after, but again expands to a width of thirty or\r\nforty feet, and a hight of twenty, continuing these dimensions for about\r\na mile, to the first _hoppers_,[2] where a manufactory of saltpeter had\r\nrecently been established. Thence to the second of these hoppers, two\r\nmiles from the entrance, it is forty feet in width, and sixty in hight.\r\nThroughout nearly the whole of the distance handsome walls had been made\r\nby the manufacturers, of the loose limestone. The road was hard, and as\r\nsmooth as a flag pavement. In every passage which the doctor traversed,\r\nthe sides of the cavern were perpendicular, and the arches, which have\r\nbid defiance even to earthquakes, were regular. In 1802, when the heavy\r\nshocks of earthquakes came on which were so severely felt in this part\r\nof Kentucky, the workmen stationed at the second hoppers, heard about\r\nfive minutes before each shock, a heavy rumbling noise issue from the\r\ncave, like a strong wind. When that ceased, the rocks cracked, and the\r\nwhole appeared to be going in a moment to final destruction. However, no\r\none was injured, although large portions of rock fell in different parts\r\nof the cavern.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 2:\r\n\r\n  A hopper is an inverted cone, into which corn is put at a mill before\r\n  it runs between the stones.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIn advancing into the cavern, the avenue leads from the second hoppers,\r\nwest, one mile; and thence, south-west, to the chief area or city, which\r\nis six miles from the entrance. This avenue, throughout its whole extent\r\nfrom the above station to the cross-roads, or chief area, is from sixty\r\nto one hundred feet in hight, of a similar width, and nearly on a level,\r\nthe floor or bottom being covered with loose limestone and saltpeter\r\nearth. “When,” observes the doctor, “I reached this immense area (called\r\nthe chief city) which contains upward of eight acres, without a single\r\npillar to support the arch, which is entire over the whole, I was struck\r\ndumb with astonishment. Nothing can be more sublime and grand than this\r\nplace, of which but a faint idea can be conveyed, covered with one solid\r\narch at least one hundred feet high, and to all appearance entire.”\r\n\r\nHaving entered the area, the doctor perceived five large avenues leading\r\nfrom it, from sixty to one hundred feet in width, and about forty in\r\nhight. The stone walls are arched, and were from forty to eighty feet\r\nperpendicular in hight before the commencement of the arch.\r\n\r\nIn exploring these avenues, the precaution was taken to cut arrows,\r\npointing to the mouth of the cave, on the stones beneath the feet, to\r\nprevent any difficulty in the return. The first which was traversed,\r\ntook a southerly direction for more than two miles; when a second was\r\ntaken, which led first east, and then north, for more than two miles\r\nfurther. These windings at length brought the party, by another avenue,\r\nto the chief city again, after having traversed different avenues for\r\nmore than five miles. Having reposed for a few moments on slabs of\r\nlimestone near the center of this gloomy area, and refreshed themselves\r\nand trimmed their lamps, they departed a second time, through an avenue\r\nalmost north, parallel with the one leading from the chief city to the\r\nmouth of the cavern; and, having proceeded upward of two miles, came to\r\nthe second city. This is covered with a single arch, nearly two hundred\r\nfeet high in the center, and is very similar to the chief city, except\r\nin the number of its avenues, which are two only. They crossed it, over\r\na very considerable rise in the center, and descended through an avenue\r\nwhich bore to the east, to the distance of nearly a mile, when they came\r\nto a third area, or city, about one hundred feet square, and fifty in\r\nhight, which had a pure and delightful stream of water issuing from the\r\nside of a wall about thirty feet high, and which fell on a broken\r\nsurface of stone, and was afterward entirely lost to view.\r\n\r\nHaving passed a few yards beyond this beautiful sheet of water, so as to\r\nreach the end of the avenue, the party returned about one hundred yards,\r\nand passing over a considerable mass of stone, entered another, but\r\nsmaller avenue to the right, which carried them south, through a third,\r\nof an uncommonly black hue, somewhat more than a mile; when they\r\nascended a very steep hill about sixty yards, which conducted them to\r\nwithin the walls of the fourth city. It is not inferior to the second,\r\nhaving an arch which covers at least six acres. In this last avenue, the\r\nextremity of which can not be less than four miles from the chief city,\r\nand ten from the mouth of the cavern, are upward of twenty large piles\r\nof saltpeter earth on the one side, and broken limestone heaped up on\r\nthe other, evidently the work of human hands.\r\n\r\nFrom the course of his needle, the doctor expected that this avenue\r\nwould have led circuitously to the chief city; but was much disappointed\r\nwhen he reached the extremity, a few hundred yards’ distance from the\r\nfourth city. In retracing his steps, not having paid a due attention to\r\nmark the entrances of the different avenues, he was greatly bewildered,\r\nand once completely lost himself for nearly fifteen or twenty minutes.\r\nThus, faint and wearied, he did not reach the chief area till ten at\r\nnight; but was still determined to explore the cavern so long as his\r\nlight should last. Having entered the fifth and last avenue from the\r\nchief area, and proceeded south-east about nine hundred yards, he came\r\nto the fifth area, the arch of which covers upward of four acres of\r\nlevel ground, strewed with limestone, and having fire-beds of an\r\nuncommon size, surrounded with brands of cane, interspersed. Another\r\navenue on the opposite side, led to one of still greater capacity, the\r\nwalls or sides of which were more perfect than any that had been\r\nnoticed, running almost due south for nearly a mile and a half, and\r\nbeing very level and straight, with an elegant arch. While the doctor\r\nwas employed, at the extremity of this avenue, in sketching a plan of\r\nthe cave, one of his guides, who had strayed to a distance, called on\r\nhim to follow. Leaving the other guide, he was led to a vertical\r\npassage, which opened into a chamber at least eighteen hundred feet in\r\ncircumference, and the center of the arch of which was one hundred and\r\nfifty feet in hight.\r\n\r\nIt was past midnight when he entered this chamber of eternal darkness;\r\nand when he reflected on the different avenues through which he had\r\npassed since he had penetrated the cave at eight in the morning, and now\r\nfound himself buried several miles in the dark recesses of this awful\r\ncavern—the grave, perhaps, of thousands of human beings—he felt a\r\nshivering horror. The avenue, or passage, which led from it was as large\r\nas any he had entered; and it is uncertain how far he might have\r\ntraveled had his lights not failed him. All those who have any knowledge\r\nof this cave, he observes, conjecture that Green river, a stream\r\nnavigable several hundred miles, passes over three of its branches.\r\n\r\nAfter a lapse of nearly an hour, he descended by what is called the\r\n“passage of the chimney,” and joined the other guide. Thence returning\r\nto the chief area or city, where the lamps were trimmed for the last\r\ntime, he entered the spacious avenue which led to the second hoppers.\r\nHere he met with various curiosities, such as spars, petrifactions, &c.;\r\nand these he brought away, together with _a mummy_ which was found at\r\nthe second hoppers. He reached the mouth of the cave about three in the\r\nmorning, nearly exhausted with nineteen hours of constant fatigue. He\r\nnearly fainted on leaving it, and on inhaling the vapid air of the\r\natmosphere, after having so long breathed the pure air occasioned by the\r\nniter of the cave. His pulse beat stronger when in the cave, but not so\r\nquick as when on the surface.\r\n\r\nHere the doctor observes that he has hardly described half the cave, not\r\nhaving named the avenues between its mouth and the second hoppers. This\r\npart of his narrative is of equal interest with what has been already\r\ngiven. He states that there is a passage in the main avenue, upward of\r\nnine hundred feet from the entrance, like that of a trap-door. By\r\nsliding aside a large flat stone, you can descend sixteen or eighteen\r\nfeet in a very narrow defile, where the passage comes on a level, and\r\nwinds about in such a manner, as to pass under the main passage without\r\nhaving any communication with it, at length opening into the main cave\r\nby two large passages just beyond the second hoppers. This is called the\r\n“glauber-salt room,” from salts of that kind being found there. Next\r\ncome the sick room, the bat-room, and the flint-room, together with a\r\nwinding avenue, which, branching off at the second hoppers, runs west\r\nand south-west for more than two miles. It is called the “haunted\r\nchamber,” from the echo within: its arch is very beautifully incrusted\r\nwith limestone spar; and in many places the columns of spar are truly\r\nelegant, extending from the ceiling to the floor. Near the center of\r\nthis arch is a dome, apparently fifty feet high, hung in rich drapery,\r\nfestooned in the most fanciful manner for six or eight feet from the\r\nhangings, and in colors the most rich and brilliant. By the reflection\r\nof one or two lights, the columns of spar and the stalactites have a\r\nvery romantic appearance. Of this spar, a large elevation, called\r\n“Wilkin’s arm-chair,” has been formed in the center of the avenue and\r\nencircled with many smaller ones. The columns of the spar, fluted and\r\nstudded with knobs of spar and stalactites; the drapery of the various\r\ncolors superbly festooned and hung in the most graceful manner, these\r\nare shown with the greatest brilliancy by the reflection of the lamps.\r\n\r\nIn the vicinity of the haunted chamber, the sound of a cataract was\r\nheard; and at the extremity of the avenue was a reservoir of water, very\r\nclear and grateful to the taste, having, apparently, neither inlet nor\r\noutlet. Here the air, as in many other parts of the cave, was pure and\r\ndelightful. Not far from the reservoir, an avenue presented itself,\r\nwithin which were several columns of the most brilliant spar, sixty or\r\nseventy feet in hight, and almost perpendicular, standing in basins of\r\nwater; which, as well as the columns, were of surpassing splendor and\r\nbeauty.\r\n\r\nSo far we have followed the brief and general account of Dr. Ward.\r\nTurning now to other accounts, we find that the cave extends for miles\r\nunder the earth, and that the end of it has never yet been reached by\r\nany explorer. The air is not only pure, but delightful and exhilarating,\r\nand has been highly recommended for diseases of the lungs, so much so,\r\nthat quite a number of small houses have been built within to\r\naccommodate consumptive persons, who at times have resided there with\r\nbenefit. The temperature there is uniformly the same, being in both\r\nwinter and summer, from fifty-five degrees to fifty-nine degrees\r\nFahrenheit. Combustion is perfect in all parts of the cave, and\r\ndecomposition is nowhere observable. No reptiles, of any description,\r\nhave ever been seen within it. The loudest thunder can not be heard a\r\nquarter of a mile within, and the only sound is the roar of the\r\nwaterfalls, of which there are some seven or eight.\r\n\r\nThe entire cave, so far as explored, contains two hundred and fifty or\r\nmore avenues, nearly fifty domes, twenty-two pits and three rivers. Many\r\nof the avenues contain large and magnificent stalagmite columns,\r\nextending from the floor to the ceiling, and some of very grotesque and\r\nfanciful shape. Graceful stalactites may likewise be seen pendant from\r\nthe ceilings, as uniform and regular as if they were cut by the hand of\r\nman. The engraving gives a view of one of those avenues where the\r\nstalagmites and stalactites abound in great profusion. In another part\r\nof this avenue, in what is called the Gothic Chapel, these stalactic\r\nformations are still more striking, very much resembling a monkish\r\ncathedral. In the Fairy Grotto, the formations likewise assume a great\r\nmany fanciful shapes.\r\n\r\nPassing now to the second account of a visit to the cave, to which we\r\nhave already alluded, we find the visitor saying, that the cave is every\r\nway so wonderful, that it is impossible to give more than a faint idea\r\nof its magnificence and splendor. “As in exploring the cave,” he\r\ncontinues, “there are three rivers to cross and a great deal of climbing\r\nover rocks and crawling through narrow places, ladies adopt the Bloomer\r\ncostume from necessity, and gentlemen are provided with dresses\r\naccording to their fancy, so that a party starting out for a trip\r\nthrough the cave, present a most grotesque and comical appearance. On\r\narriving at the mouth, the visitor is provided with a lamp, and makes an\r\nabrupt, though comparatively easy descent of some seventy or eighty\r\nfeet. Here he enters a dark avenue, about five rods wide, called the\r\nNarrows, and soon finds himself far beyond where daylight ever shone. At\r\nthe distance of about six hundred yards from the mouth, this avenue\r\nexpands and forms a large circular room, called the Rotunda, or Great\r\nVestibule. The guide stops here, and ignites a light, a compound of\r\nsulphur, saltpeter and antimony, prepared for illuminating the various\r\npoints of special interest through the cave. This forms a most brilliant\r\nlight, and reveals a room some two or three hundred feet wide, and\r\nforty-seven feet high. The view revealed by this first illumination is\r\nmost imposing and sublime. I told my guide that he was certainly right\r\nin his ideas about describing the cave. As he saw me getting my paper\r\nand pencil ready at the mouth, he began laughing very significantly, and\r\nsaid, ‘Writin ’bout the cave aint no use, sir. Most everybody that goes\r\nin writes, but they gin’ally throws it away when they comes out. Writin\r\ndon’t do no good. If anybody wants to know ’bout the cave, they must\r\ncome and see it.’ Although I had barely commenced my journey through it,\r\nI told my guide that I could heartily subscribe to the whole of his\r\nspeech on this subject.\r\n\r\n“And right here, in the great vestibule, I will stop to say a few words\r\nabout my guide. There are four guides to the cave, all of whom are said\r\nto be entirely familiar with it, and to give the most perfect\r\nsatisfaction to visitors. At all events, I was entirely satisfied with\r\n‘Alfred,’ with whom I made four different journeys through the cave,\r\ntraveling under ground through various avenues more than fifty miles.\r\nAlfred formerly belonged to Miss Mary Croghan, whose elopement from a\r\nboarding-school on Staten Island about a dozen years ago, with Captain\r\nShinley, created so great a sensation in New York and elsewhere. After\r\nshe went to England, she gave Alfred to some of her relatives, and he\r\nbelonged to Dr. Croghan at the time of his death, who was the owner of\r\nthe cave. By the terms of Dr. Croghan’s will, Alfred and his wife and\r\nchildren will be free in about eighteen months. He is now drawing wages\r\nfor his services, which, with the liberal presents he receives from\r\nvisitors, will enable him to make a very fine start in the world. Alfred\r\nhas evidently been a great pet, as he learned to read when very small;\r\nand he astonishes visitors by his use of scientific terms, and his\r\nknowledge of chemistry and geology. He has now been a guide to the cave\r\nabout sixteen years; has visited it with a great many scientific men;\r\nhas most of the standard works on geology, and is altogether an\r\ninteresting character. He sees persons from all parts of the union, and\r\nunderstands all the excitements at the north, from that created by Uncle\r\nTom’s Cabin, down to the Forrest divorce trial. He was anxious to buy\r\nUncle Tom’s Cabin, and was told that he had better buy a Bible. So he\r\npaid four dollars and a half for a Bible, and bought Uncle Tom too. I\r\ncan not do less than recommend all my friends who may visit the cave, to\r\ntry and secure Alfred for a guide.\r\n\r\n“Leaving the vestibule and passing the Kentucky cliffs, so called from\r\ntheir likeness to the cliffs in Kentucky river, we come to what is very\r\nappropriately named the Church and Galleries. At various points upon the\r\nroute thus far, we have seen the leaching vats and other remains of the\r\nsaltpeter works that were erected in the cave nearly fifty years ago.\r\nThe manufacture of saltpeter was carried on quite extensively in the\r\ncave for several years, and the guide says the saltpeter was\r\nmanufactured here with which the powder was made which was used in the\r\nbattle of New Orleans. There is a very plain cart-path through this part\r\nof the cave, and we saw the tracks of oxen which were made forty-seven\r\nyears ago. The church is the point in the cave where the miners\r\nassembled for worship. The rude pulpit or stand from which the preacher\r\naddressed his congregation, still remains. But besides this there is a\r\nnatural pulpit and galleries which are easily ascended by steps in the\r\nwall, from which sermons are now frequently preached to visitors, for\r\nwhom seats are provided. When illuminated, this church is more awfully\r\nimposing and solemn, than any temple built by human hands. The cave is\r\nmore than one hundred feet wide, its massive rocky walls about fifteen\r\nfeet high, and stretching away in each direction until lost in the most\r\nimpenetrable darkness. For myself, I could not understand how any man\r\nwould consent to lift his puny voice where God speaks so impressively.\r\nBut there is a difference in tastes, and many, I doubt not, are\r\npersuaded against their own will to gratify the strong desire of the\r\nvisitors to hear preaching in the cave. Going on from this point we pass\r\nthe Grand Arch, a natural arch sixty-six feet high, and about seventy\r\nyards wide, and one hundred and fifty yards long; and some distance\r\nbeyond are shown the Giant’s Coffin. This is a huge rock, so formed that\r\nthe top of it is a fine representation of a coffin. The shape is almost\r\nprecisely that of a modern metallic coffin. This rock lies exactly east\r\nand west, by the compass, and is fifty-seven and a half feet long.\r\n\r\n“Here we left the broad main cave in which we had thus far been\r\ntraveling, and which stretched on indefinitely before us, and turned off\r\ninto a narrow, circuitous, irregular avenue, and wandered indefinitely.\r\nClambering over rocks, going down precipitous steeps, passing a great\r\nvariety of rooms, lofty domes, intricate labyrinths, pits from\r\nseventy-five to one hundred and seventy-five feet deep, and a great many\r\nother points, all appropriately and often very significantly named, we\r\nat length came to Gorin’s Dome, so called from the name of its\r\ndiscoverer, by far the most imposing I had yet seen. Coming to the end\r\nof a narrow avenue, the guide directed me to look through an opening in\r\nthe wall, a kind of window, and our lamps revealed hights above and\r\ndepths below, that seemed interminable! He then kindled one of the\r\nlights that I have already described, and placing it upon a board,\r\nthrust it through the opening and told me to look, first below and then\r\nabove. The view was utterly indescribable and almost overpowering. The\r\nopening was not more than thirty feet in circumference, and I have\r\nalready forgotten the hight and depth as given me by the guide. But I\r\nfelt for hours and still feel the tremblings of those emotions that\r\nthrilled through my whole frame as I peered into those abysmal depths,\r\nand looked up into those giddy hights. None but Jehovah could build such\r\na dome.\r\n\r\n“I can not undertake to give the details of our route from avenue to\r\navenue, nor mention the various points of interest that we passed. We\r\nwere at length in a vast open space; the guide took our lamps, and going\r\na short distance from us, told us to look up, and we at once discovered\r\nthat we were in the far-famed Star Chamber. The cave here is some twenty\r\nor thirty yards wide, and about sixty or seventy feet high, and in a dim\r\nlight the arch above presents the appearance of the sky in a very starry\r\nnight. On looking up you see innumerable stars, and as you gaze for a\r\nlong time the sky seems to be very distant, the stars increase in\r\nnumber, and it seems quite as if you were really looking through an\r\nopening in the cave into the heavens. Our guide Alfred was with\r\nProfessor Silliman when he examined this arch by the aid of a Drummond\r\nlight, to discover the cause of this appearance, and found that it was\r\ncrystals embedded in the wall. After we had satisfied ourselves with\r\nviewing this artificial sky, Alfred took all our lamps and going into a\r\ncave below us, by the shadows from his lamps gave us a representation of\r\nclouds passing over the sky, obscuring the stars, thunder-clouds rolling\r\nover and the stars appearing again, and other interesting illusions.\r\nAfter this he went still deeper in the cave below us, leaving us in the\r\nmost pitchy darkness. We were so deep in the bowels of the earth that\r\nthe loudest thunder has never been heard there, and the silence and\r\ndarkness were awfully impressive. Suddenly we saw in the direction in\r\nwhich our guide had disappeared, a light like the rising of the moon,\r\nwhich grew larger and larger, until Alfred emerged through some opening\r\nfrom the regions below, and appeared in the distance in the same cave in\r\nwhich we were standing.\r\n\r\n“After leaving this chamber, which was more beautiful than any we had\r\nentered, we made our way to the Gothic Gallery. This avenue was unlike\r\nanything we had yet seen. It is some four or five rods wide and\r\nthree-quarters of a mile long, the path over which we walked being much\r\nmore level than the most of those we had walked over, and much of the\r\nwall over our heads looking almost as smooth as if it had been\r\nplastered. In this avenue we visited the Haunted Chamber, so called from\r\nthe fact that two mummies were discovered here many years ago; Vulcan’s\r\nForge, so called from being very dark, and a formation resembling\r\ncinders; and near its end the Gothic Gallery. This room has a great\r\nvariety of stalactite and stalagmite formations, many of which have\r\nformed solid massive pillars. As we approached the Chapel, our guide\r\nmade us all stay behind, while he went ahead, taking all our lamps with\r\nhim; and when we went forward at his call, we found each of our lamps\r\nhung upon some one of these pillars, and illuminating a room, compared\r\nwith which Taylor’s saloon on Broadway, or the most gorgeous saloon New\r\nYork can boast, is simplicity itself. These formations are a wonderful\r\ncuriosity. They are of a very light color, are nearly as hard as\r\ngranite, and are said to be formed by the drippings of lime water. They\r\nare in a great variety of shapes, to which a great many fanciful names\r\nhave been given, such as the Pulpit, the Devil’s Arm-Chair, the Pillars\r\nof Hercules, &c.\r\n\r\n“I had intended in this letter to speak of the chief points of interest\r\nin what is called the short route through the cave; that is, the portion\r\nof the cave that is visited without crossing either of the rivers. I\r\nmade two visits on this side of the rivers, the first time traveling\r\nabout six miles, and the second time traveling ten miles and a half. But\r\nI am the more willing to pass by the Bandit’s Hall, Mammoth Dome,\r\nPersico Avenue, Crockett’s Dome, Snowball Arch, Bunyan’s Way, and other\r\nplaces of special interest, with a mere mention of their names, from the\r\nfact that it is so entirely impossible to describe them. Some of these\r\nare but rarely visited, and it costs no little effort to reach them. But\r\nhowever narrow the fissures in the rocks through which we squeezed,\r\nhowever steep and slippery the ascent, however long the distance we had\r\nto crawl on our hands and knees, we were always more than paid for our\r\npains.\r\n\r\n“Omitting, then, any detailed account of what is called the short route,\r\nI pass to a notice of the long route, to which most of our time was\r\ngiven. In taking this we entered the cave as before, passed through the\r\ngreat vestibule, and on for a mile or two through the main branch, over\r\nthe same route we had already traveled. It seems impossible to realize\r\nthat this is a cave, it is so high, so wide, so vast. Several of our\r\ncompany remarked this fact. We seemed rather to be in some deep, dark\r\nravine or mountain gorge, wandering by the light of our dim lamps, in\r\nsome night that was utterly rayless and starless. We at length reached\r\nthe Bottomless Pit, where we entered upon a path that was new to us.\r\nThis pit is a deep, dark, fearful chasm, and received its name before\r\nanything like bottom had been found. It has now been measured to the\r\ndepth of one hundred and seventy-five feet, and there may be fissures in\r\nthe rock descending indefinitely below. Near this pit, we passed over an\r\nartificial bridge, and entered the Valley of Humility, through which we\r\nmade our way, stooping and crawling, until we reached what is the most\r\ncomical and laughable point in the cave, which is most appropriately\r\nnamed the Winding Way, or Fat Man’s Misery. This is an exceedingly\r\ncircuitous opening in the rock, about eighteen inches wide, and between\r\nthree and four hundred feet long. At the entrance of this way, the\r\nfissure through which we pass is not more than about two feet deep, and\r\nthe ceiling above us is so high that we could stand erect without\r\ndifficulty; but in advancing, the fissure becomes deeper, the rocks on\r\neither hand are higher and higher, and the ceiling above becomes lower\r\nand lower, and it seems to be, indeed, not only fat, but tall men’s\r\nmisery. It is a most laughable sight to see a party edging their way\r\nthrough this zigzag path; a path that gives every indication of having\r\nbeen washed and worn by the action of the water for innumerable years.\r\nOur party was a decidedly lean one, so that we did not, like many\r\nothers, have the amusement of seeing some one of aldermanic proportions\r\nsqueeze and worry his way through. Finally, however, we got through, and\r\ncame into a large open space, which our guide called Great Relief, and a\r\n_relief_ it was, sure enough. Passing on, we entered a large, roomy\r\navenue called River Hall, where we were shown the high-water mark in the\r\ncave; where, in times of freshets, the river rises fifty-seven feet,\r\nperpendicularly, above low-water mark in the cave. We turned aside from\r\nthis hall into a large room, to witness a great curiosity called the\r\nBacon Chamber. Here the formations overhead are such as to make the room\r\nlook remarkably like a large smoke-house filled with hams; and near by\r\nwe were shown a smooth circular excavation in the wall above us, which\r\nwas pointed out as the _kettle_ for boiling these hams, now turned\r\nbottom upward. Returning to the Hall, we went forward, passing several\r\npoints of interest, until we came to a pure and beautiful body of water\r\ncalled Lake Lethe, upon which we embarked in a small boat provided for\r\nthe purpose. We were now all on the look-out for the eyeless fish that\r\nare found in the waters of the cave, and were so fortunate as to catch\r\nin a small net, first, what was called a clawfish, having legs like a\r\nlobster, but eyeless and apparently bloodless, being almost precisely\r\nthe color of potato sprouts that have grown in the spring in a dark\r\ncellar. Afterward we caught a very small fish of the same color, and\r\nhaving no eyes. Where the eyes should grow, the flesh was smooth and\r\njust like the rest of the body. Whatever our doubts might have been\r\nbefore, we here had ocular demonstration that the fish in these waters,\r\nwhich are never illumined except by lamplight, are entirely without\r\nsight.\r\n\r\n“Leaving Lake Lethe, we entered a most grand and imposing avenue, with\r\nlofty rocky walls towering about two hundred and fifty feet high, called\r\nthe Great Walk. This leads to the Echo River, one of the greatest of\r\nthese subterranean wonders. We sailed down this river a distance of\r\n_three-quarters of a mile_, and such a sail! Where on the earth or under\r\nthe earth, could another such a sail be taken? The water was cold, clear\r\nand pure, and in color remarkably like the Niagara, as it plunges over\r\nthe falls. At many places we could see the bottom, and in others it\r\nseemed of very great depth. It flowed in placid stillness, unrippled by\r\na single breeze, between, above and beneath walls of massive and eternal\r\nrock. Now the channel was deep, narrow and tortuous, and now it spread\r\nout into a broad, pellucid stream. Now the massive ceiling above us was\r\nhigh, and smooth, and beautifully arched; and now it was so rough,\r\nbroken and low, that we had to stoop as we sat in our boat, in order to\r\npass under it. We did not pass rapidly down this stream. None of us were\r\nin a hurry. We seemed scarcely to belong to this driving, go-ahead\r\nworld. Now a shout echoed wildly and magnificently through the rocky\r\nchambers; and now we sat entranced while one of our company, a splendid\r\nmusician, sang some beautiful song, never as beautiful as now, when it\r\nechoed and reëchoed along these walls, and died away in the darkness\r\nthat our dim lamps could not penetrate. This river, too, is most\r\nappropriately named. The echoes are most perfect and beautiful. We\r\nexperimented in a great variety of ways, singing alone and in concert,\r\nshouting, whistling, clapping our hands, and finally, the whole company\r\nsung Ortonville. But there was one thing more impressive than all these,\r\nand that was silence! We sat in our boat as quietly as possible, no one\r\nspeaking or moving for some time; and the stillness and the darkness by\r\nwhich we were surrounded, were solemn and awful beyond all description.\r\nWe were deep in the bowels of the earth, I know not how many feet below\r\nits surface, but so low that no ray of light from the sun had ever\r\npenetrated its depths, and no voice of loudest thunder had ever waked an\r\necho there. The silence was perfect, save the sound of breathing which\r\neach one tried to suppress, and the throbbing of our hearts that\r\n\r\n                ‘Still like muffled drums were beating,\r\n                Funeral marches to the grave.’\r\n\r\n“God spoke in that stillness with a voice such as I had never heard\r\nbefore. I had never before so realized how awfully impressive were\r\ndarkness and silence. I had entirely new ideas of the awful solitude of\r\nthat period when the ‘earth was without form and void, and darkness was\r\nupon the face of the deep.’\r\n\r\n“On getting beyond this river, we entered a region of avenues of\r\nincredible if not of interminable length, which have been discovered\r\nwithin the last twelve or fifteen years. One of the first of these is\r\ncalled Silliman Avenue, in honor of Professor Silliman, who has made\r\nvery thorough explorations of the cave. This avenue is a mile and a half\r\nlong, about three rods wide, and has various interesting features which\r\nI have not time to notice. At the termination of this avenue, the cave\r\nwidens into a large room, several rods wide, and some fifty or sixty\r\nfeet high, which is called Ole Bull’s concert-room, from the fact that\r\nthis musician gave a free concert there to the visitors who were at the\r\ncave at the time of his visit.\r\n\r\n“Beyond this room, we entered an avenue two miles long, called the Pass\r\nof El Gor. This is an exceedingly rocky and uneven avenue, leading, by a\r\nmost circuitous path up and down great piles of rock, along a most\r\nrugged and desolate way, near deep holes and fissures in the rocks,\r\nuntil at length we come to a fine sulphur spring called Hebe’s Spring,\r\nwhich we found very refreshing. Here, through a narrow opening in the\r\nrocks, we climb a ladder eighteen feet high, and find a scene that\r\nabundantly compensates for the rough walk we have taken to reach it. On\r\nreaching the top of this ladder, we find ourselves in Martha’s Vineyard.\r\nHere is a vast room, the sides of which are covered over with a\r\nformation resembling grapes. They hang on the wall above, plump, round\r\nand perfect in form, and in the greatest profusion. They are so solid\r\nand hard that it is difficult to break off any of the clusters, and are\r\nsaid to be formed by the drippings of the water through the rocks. Near\r\nthe head of the ladder there is a fine representation of a vine, of\r\nsolid rock, running along the wall; and apparently connected with this\r\nvine, there are seemingly cart-loads of these rocky grapes. Our guide\r\nillumined the vineyard with one of his Bengal lights, and the view was\r\nmagnificent.\r\n\r\n“Going on from this point through Elindo’s Avenue and Washington’s Hall,\r\nwe reached another of the remarkable rooms of the cave, called the\r\nSnowball Room. The cave is here about a hundred feet wide, ten or\r\nfifteen feet high, and the ceiling quite even and beautifully arched.\r\nNature has here played most fantastic tricks. I know of no way so good\r\nto describe this room, as to say that its walls and ceiling overhead\r\nlook like the end of some building that a score of school-boys have\r\ncompletely covered over with snowballs. We examined these formations for\r\nsome time with our lamps, and then Alfred gave us the benefit of an\r\nillumination. But of its appearance when thus lighted up, I will attempt\r\nno description.\r\n\r\n“We were now about seven miles from the mouth of the cave; and with\r\nappetites sharpened by our long walk, we sat down to the dinner which\r\nour host had sent along for us. It was a magnificent dining-saloon in\r\nwhich we were seated. Taylor’s saloon on Broadway is splendid, and has\r\ndazzled and bewildered multitudes, when they first entered it; but\r\nneither Taylor, nor prince, nor potentate, ever built a room so gorgeous\r\nas that in which we were seated. None but the God who built the skies,\r\nand bent and decorated the arch above us, could build another comparable\r\nto it.\r\n\r\n“The Snowball Room is at the entrance of an avenue more extensive and\r\nbeautiful than any other in the cave. This is called Cleveland’s\r\nCabinet, and is altogether indescribable. It is about five rods wide and\r\ntwo miles long! Think of its dimensions a moment! About as long as\r\nBroadway from the Battery to Union Square, and with walls, not of brick,\r\ngranite and marble, shaped and graven by art and man’s device, but with\r\nwalls and ceiling above covered all over with the exquisite and\r\nbeautiful workmanship of its divine builder.\r\n\r\n“We passed slowly through this cabinet, two miles long, the guide\r\nconducting us from point to point of remarkable interest, and all the\r\nway along showing us new and strange developments. We went to Mary’s\r\nBower, Virginia’s Festoons, Saint Cecelia’s Grotto, Flora’s Garden,\r\nwhere were roses and lilies, rosettes and wreaths, as perfect as though\r\nthey had been chiseled there by the most accomplished sculptor. The\r\nformation on the wall in which these various flowers and other beautiful\r\nthings are developed, is gypsum of the most snowy whiteness; and our\r\nguide said it was in three separate layers, and that the forming process\r\nwas constantly going on, the inner layers crowding off the outer. The\r\nfloor was covered with tuns of these layers, which had been crowded off,\r\nand which visitors are at liberty to carry off as specimens, while they\r\nare strictly prohibited from breaking anything from the walls. But still\r\nit is with the utmost difficulty that the guides can preserve some of\r\nthe most beautiful views in the cave from the destruction of vandal\r\nvisitors. This part of the cave is less beautiful than formerly, having\r\nbecome a good deal smoked by the lamps of the thousands of visitors who\r\nhave examined it. But our guide took us into an avenue immediately under\r\nthis, which is but rarely visited, and conducted us to a most enchanting\r\nspot called Egeria’s Grotto. Here the formations were as pure, and\r\nbeautiful and white, as if fresh from the hand of their Maker. Here were\r\nformations, not only of the purest white, but of other most exquisite\r\ncoloring. We remained a long time in this grotto, examining its various\r\nwonders, and deemed ourselves very fortunate in seeing it, as from this\r\nwe could better understand how Cleveland’s Cabinet above us appeared\r\nduring the long ages that intervened before it was polluted by the\r\npresence of man. Another beautiful grotto was perfectly brilliant and\r\ngorgeous, and looked as though its rough walls were a solid mass of\r\ndiamonds. The most gorgeous and brilliant room ever built in the palace\r\nof an earthly monarch, is tameness itself compared with this diamond\r\ngrotto.\r\n\r\n“Emerging again into Cleveland’s Cabinet, we passed on to its\r\ntermination, where we ascended the Rocky Mountains, a vast pile of\r\nloose, broken rocks, one hundred and sixty feet high, which have\r\napparently dropped down from the cave above, leaving a vast vaulted\r\nopening in the cave above, to indicate the place from which they have\r\nfallen. Beyond these mountains, the cave branches in three directions.\r\nWe took the branch leading to Croghan’s Hall, the remotest point in the\r\ncave that has yet been visited, and _nine miles from its mouth_. On the\r\nright of this room there is a deep, awful pit, into which we threw\r\nstones, as we had into many others, and heard them roll and bound from\r\nrock to rock, down a distance of one hundred and eighty-five feet. The\r\nwater from some point below us runs over these rocks, and flows off, no\r\nmortal knows where. This hall contains large, massive pillars,\r\nelaborately carved and ornamented by the Invisible Architect,\r\nstalactites and stalagmites of various beautiful forms, and its walls\r\nare festooned with that rich drapery which no art can imitate, and which\r\nonly decks the grottos, bowers and halls of this wonderful cave.\r\n\r\n“After refreshing ourselves here from a pleasant spring, we started on\r\nour nine-mile tramp for the mouth of the cave, taking only a hurried\r\nglance of the varied objects of interest as we passed them. We, however,\r\nsailed very leisurely down Echo River, or the Jordan, as it is also\r\ncalled. We again had solos and choruses, and drank in rich delights from\r\nthis enchanting sail. When we reached Lethe, some of our party\r\ndetermined to send their clothes across in our boat and swim over. They\r\naccordingly plunged in very boldly, but hurried out in the quickest time\r\npossible; and the chattering of teeth, shivering, leaping and running to\r\nget warm again, seemed more befitting a bath in February, than in one of\r\nthe hottest days in August.\r\n\r\n“I had now made four different visits to the cave, traveling, according\r\nto the reckoning of my guide, about fifty-four miles. Very few visitors\r\nexplore it as thoroughly, and yet I had not gone over one-third of the\r\nspace that has already been explored. The guide says that two hundred\r\nand fifty different avenues are already known, measuring the distance of\r\none hundred and sixty-five miles. The temperature of the cave is\r\nuniformly about fifty-five degrees, and its bracing, invigorating\r\ncharacter may be judged from the fact that ladies, some of them quite\r\ndelicate, are constantly taking this ‘long route,’ traveling a greater\r\nnumber of miles than most men would think of going on foot above ground.\r\n\r\n“We felt but little fatigue from our rough, clambering walk of some\r\ntwenty miles, until we emerged from the cave, and came in contact with\r\nouter air. After breathing the air of the cave from eight A. M. till\r\nfive P. M., the atmosphere seemed very impure. We could smell every\r\ntree, and plant, and old log; and the air was so sultry and sickening,\r\nthat we had to rest awhile at the mouth before starting for the hotel,\r\nsome fifty rods distant.\r\n\r\n“I have thus attempted to redeem my promise in regard to writing you\r\nfrom the cave. I had no thought of writing at so great length. If the\r\ncave were possessed of mind and sensibility, I would take off my hat to\r\nit, and feelingly ask its pardon for the great injustice I have done it\r\nin these letters. But as it is, I will only say that I have over and\r\nover again assented to the truthfulness and justice of my guide Alfred’s\r\nidea of all descriptions of the cave: ‘Writin don’t do no good. If\r\nanybody wants to know how the cave looks, they must come and see it.’\r\nAnd I can not conceive of any journey for this purpose so long and\r\ntoilsome, that those making it would not be abundantly compensated for\r\ntheir pains, by a view of this wonderful work of a wonder-working God.”\r\n\r\nStill another visitor, writing to a friend in Europe, says of this\r\nwonderful cave, “I had heard and read descriptions of it, long since;\r\nbut the half, the quarter, was not told. Its vastness, its lofty arches,\r\nits immense reach into the bosom of the solid earth, fill me with\r\nastonishment. It is, like Mont Blanc, Chimborazo, and the falls of\r\nNiagara, one of God’s mightiest works. Shall I compare it with anything\r\nof a similar description, which you have seen on the other side of the\r\nAtlantic? with the grotto of Neptune, or that of the Sibyl, at Tivoli,\r\nor with any of Virgil’s poetic Italian machinery? No comparison can be\r\ninstituted. I speak, as you are aware, from personal knowledge. You,\r\nseated on the opposite bank of the Arno, have seen me clamber up, from\r\nthe noisy waters below, to the entrance of the far-famed grotto of\r\nNeptune, which I leisurely explored. In point of capaciousness, that\r\ngrotto has little more to boast of than the cellar of a large hotel,\r\nand, like that, was, as I think, excavated by human hands. That of the\r\nTiburtine Sibyl is still more limited in its dimensions. Indeed, every\r\ncavern which I have ever seen, if placed along side of this, would\r\ndwindle into insignificance.”\r\n\r\nThe same writer says, “I can not refrain from giving you an account of\r\nan incident that happened in this cave last spring. A wedding party went\r\nto the cave to spend the honeymoon. While there, they went to visit\r\nthose beautiful portions of the cave which lie beyond the river\r\n‘Jordan.’ In order to do this, a person has to sail down the river\r\nnearly a mile before reaching the avenue which leads off from the river\r\non the opposite side, for there is no shore, or landing-place, between\r\nthe point above on this side, where you come to the river, and that\r\nbelow on the other; for the river fills the whole width of one avenue of\r\nthe cave, and is several feet deep where the side walls descend into the\r\nwater. This party had descended the river, visited the cave beyond, and\r\nhad again embarked on the water for their return homeward. After they\r\nhad ascended the river about half-way, some of the party, who were in a\r\nhigh glee, got into a romp and overturned the boat. Their lights were\r\nall extinguished, their matches wet, the boat filled with water and sunk\r\nimmediately; and _there they were_, in ‘the blackness of darkness,’ up\r\nto their chins in water. No doubt, they would all have been lost, had it\r\nnot been for the guide’s great presence of mind. He charged them to\r\nremain perfectly still; for, if they moved a single step, they might get\r\nout of their depth in water; and swimming would not avail them, for they\r\ncould not see where to swim to. He knew that, if they could bear the\r\ncoldness of the water any length of time, they would be safe; for\r\nanother guide would be sent from the cave house, to see what had become\r\nof them. And in this perilous condition, up to their mouths in water, in\r\nthe midst of darkness ‘more than night,’ _four miles under ground_, they\r\nremained for upward of five hours; at the end of which time, another\r\nguide came to their relief. Matthew, or Mat, the guide who rescued them,\r\ntold me that, when he got to where they were, his fellow-guide, Stephen,\r\n(the Columbus of the cave,) was swimming around the rest of the party,\r\ncheering them, and directing his movements, while swimming, by the sound\r\nof their voices, which were raised, one and all, in prayer and\r\nsupplication for deliverance!”\r\n\r\nIn conclusion it may be interesting to state, that Colonel Croghan, to\r\nwhose family the Mammoth cave belongs, was a resident of Louisville,\r\nKentucky. He went to Europe some twenty years ago, and found himself\r\nfrequently questioned of the wonders of the Mammoth cave, a place he had\r\nnever visited, and of which he had heard but little at home, though\r\nliving within ninety miles of it. He went there on his return, and the\r\nidea struck him to purchase it, and make it a family inheritance. In\r\nfifteen minutes’ bargaining he bought it for ten thousand dollars, and\r\nshortly after he was offered one hundred thousand dollars for his\r\npurchase. In his will he tied it up in such a way that it must remain in\r\nhis family for two generations, thus appending its celebrity to his\r\nname. There are nineteen hundred acres in the estate, though the cave\r\nprobably runs under the property of a great number of other land owners.\r\nFor fear of those who might dig down and establish an entrance to the\r\ncave on their own property, (a man’s farm extending up to the zenith and\r\ndown to the nadir,) great vigilance is exercised to prevent such\r\nsubterranean surveys and measurements as would enable one to sink a\r\nshaft with any certainty. The cave extends ten or twelve miles in\r\nseveral directions, and there is probably many a back-woodsman sitting\r\nin his hut within ten miles of the cave, quite unconscious that the most\r\nfashionable ladies and gentlemen of Europe and America are walking\r\nwithout leave under his potatoes and corn.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     THE GREAT CAVERN OF GUACHARO.\r\n\r\nPassing from the Mammoth cave in North America, let us next notice the\r\ngreat cavern of Guacharo in South America, as described in the narrative\r\nof Humboldt, which is abridged in the account that follows.\r\n\r\n“In a country where the people are fond of the marvelous, a cavern that\r\ngives birth to a river, and which is inhabited by thousands of nocturnal\r\nbirds, the fat of which is used to dress the food of the inhabitants, is\r\na ceaseless topic of conversation and discussion. Scarcely has a\r\nstranger arrived at Cumana, when he is told of the stone of Araya for\r\nthe eyes; of the laborer of Arenas who suckled his child; and of the\r\ncavern of Guacharo, which is said to be several leagues in length; till\r\nhe is tired of hearing of them.\r\n\r\n“The Cueva del Guacharo is pierced in the vertical profile of a rock.\r\nThe entrance is toward the south, and forms a vault eighty feet broad,\r\nand seventy-two feet high. The rock, that surmounts the grotto, is\r\ncovered with trees of gigantic hight. The mammee-tree, and the genipa\r\nwith large and shining leaves, raise their branches vertically toward\r\nthe sky; while those of the courbaril and the erythrina form, as they\r\nextend themselves, a thick vault of verdure. Plants of the family of\r\npothos with succulent stems, oxalises, and orchideæ of a singular\r\nstructure, rise in the driest cliffs of the rocks; while creeping\r\nplants, waving in the winds, are interwoven in festoons before the\r\nopening of the cavern. We distinguished in these festoons a bignonia of\r\na violet blue, the purple dolichos, and for the first time that\r\nmagnificent olandra, the orange flower of which has a fleshy tube more\r\nthan four inches long. The entrances of grottos, like the view of\r\ncascades, derive their principal charm from the situation, more or less\r\nmajestic, in which they are placed, and which in some sort determines\r\nthe character of the landscape. What a contrast between the Cueva of\r\nCaripe, and those caverns of the north crowned with oaks and gloomy\r\nlarch-trees!\r\n\r\n“But this luxury of vegetation embellishes not only the outside of the\r\nvault, it appears even in the vestibule of the grotto. One sees with\r\nastonishment plantain-leaved heliconias eighteen feet high, the praga\r\npalm-tree, and arborescent arums, follow the banks of the river even to\r\nthose subterranean places. The vegetation continues in the cave of\r\nCaripe, as in the deep crevices of the Andes, half excluded from the\r\nlight of day; and does not disappear, till, advancing into the interior,\r\nwe reach thirty or forty paces from the entrance. We measured the way by\r\nmeans of a cord; and we went on about four hundred and thirty feet,\r\nwithout being obliged to light our torches.\r\n\r\n“Daylight penetrates into this region, because the grotto forms but one\r\nsingle channel, which keeps the same direction from south-east to\r\nnorth-west. Where the light begins to fail, are heard from afar the\r\nhoarse sounds of the nocturnal birds, sounds which the natives think\r\nbelong exclusively to those subterraneous places. The guacharo is of the\r\nsize of our fowls, has the mouth of the goatsuckers and procnias, and\r\nthe port of those vultures, the crooked beak of which is surrounded with\r\nstiff silky hairs. It forms a new genus, very different from the\r\ngoatsucker by the force of its voice, by the considerable strength of\r\nits beak, containing a double tooth, and by its feet without the\r\nmembranes that unite the anterior phalanxes of the claws. In its manners\r\nit has analogies both to the goatsuckers and the alpine crow. The\r\nplumage of the guacharo is of a dark bluish-gray, mixed with small\r\nstreaks and specks of black. It is difficult to form an idea of the\r\nhorrible noise occasioned by thousands of these birds in the dark part\r\nof the cavern, and which can only be compared to the croaking of our\r\ncrows, which, in the pine forests of the north, live in society, and\r\nconstruct their nests upon trees, the tops of which touch each other.\r\nThe shrill and piercing cries of the guacharoes strike upon the vaults\r\nof the rocks, and are repeated by the echo in the depth of the cavern.\r\nThe Indians showed us the nests of these birds, by fixing torches to the\r\nend of a long pole. These nests were fifty or sixty feet high above our\r\nheads, in holes in the shape of funnels, with which the roof of the\r\ngrotto is pierced like a sieve. The noise increased as we advanced, and\r\nthe birds were affrighted by the light of the torches of copal. When\r\nthis noise ceased around us, we heard at a distance the plaintive cries\r\nof the birds roosting in other ramifications of the cavern. It seemed as\r\nif these bands answered each other alternately.\r\n\r\n“The Indians enter into the Cueva del Guacharo once a year, near\r\nmidsummer, armed with poles, by means of which they destroy the greater\r\npart of the nests. At this season several thousands of birds are killed;\r\nand the old ones, to defend their brood, hover around the heads of the\r\nsavage Indians, uttering terrible cries, which would appall any heart\r\nbut that of man in an untutored state.\r\n\r\n“We followed, as we continued our progress through the cavern, the banks\r\nof the small river which issued from it, and is from twenty-eight to\r\nthirty feet wide. We walked on the banks, as far as the hills formed of\r\ncalcareous incrustations permitted us. When the torrent wound among very\r\nhigh masses of stalactites, we were often obliged to descend into its\r\nbed, which is only two feet in depth. We learned with surprise, that\r\nthis subterraneous rivulet is the origin of the river Caripe, which, at\r\na few leagues’ distance, after having joined the small river of Santa\r\nMaria, is navigable for canoes. It enters into the river Areo under the\r\nname of Canno de Terezen. We found on the banks of the subterraneous\r\nrivulet a great quantity of palm-tree wood, the remains of trunks, on\r\nwhich the Indians climb to reach the nests hanging to the roofs of the\r\ncavern. The rings, formed by the vestiges of the old footstalks of the\r\nleaves, furnish as it were the footsteps of a ladder perpendicularly\r\nplaced.\r\n\r\n“The grotto of Caripe preserves the same direction, the same breadth,\r\nand its primitive hight of sixty or seventy feet, to the distance of\r\nfourteen hundred and fifty-eight feet, accurately measured. I have never\r\nseen a cavern in either continent, of so uniform and regular a\r\nconstruction. We had great difficulty in persuading the Indians to pass\r\nbeyond the outer part of the grotto, the only part which they annually\r\nvisit to collect the fat. The whole authority of the priests was\r\nnecessary, to induce them to advance as far as the spot where the soil\r\nrises abruptly at an inclination of sixty degrees, and where the torrent\r\nforms a small subterraneous cascade.[3] The natives connect mystic ideas\r\nwith this cave, inhabited by nocturnal birds; they believe, that the\r\nsouls of their ancestors sojourn in the deep recesses of the cavern.\r\n‘Man,’ say they, ‘should avoid places which are enlightened neither by\r\nthe sun nor by the moon.’ To go and join the guacharoes, is to rejoin\r\ntheir fathers, is to die. The magicians and the poisoners perform their\r\nnocturnal tricks at the entrance of the cavern, to conjure the chief of\r\nthe evil spirits.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 3:\r\n\r\n  We find this phenomenon of a subterranean cascade, but on a much\r\n  larger scale, in England, at Yordas cave, near Kingsdale, in\r\n  Yorkshire.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n“At the point where the river forms the subterraneous cascade, a hill\r\ncovered with vegetation, which is opposite the opening of the grotto,\r\npresents itself in a very picturesque manner. It appears at the\r\nextremity of a straight passage, two hundred and forty toises in length.\r\nThe stalactites, which descend from the vault, and which resemble\r\ncolumns suspended in the air, display themselves on a back-ground of\r\nverdure. The opening of the cavern appeared singularly contracted, when\r\nwe saw it about the middle of the day, illumined by the vivid light\r\nreflected at once from the sky, the plants, and the rocks. The distant\r\nlight of day formed somewhat of a magical contrast with the darkness\r\nthat surrounded us in those vast caverns. We climbed, not without some\r\ndifficulty, the small hill, whence the subterraneous rivulet descends.\r\nWe saw that the grotto was perceptibly contracted, retaining only forty\r\nfeet in its hight; and that it continued stretching to the northeast,\r\nwithout deviating from its primitive direction, which is parallel to\r\nthat of the great valley of Caripe.\r\n\r\n“The missionaries, with all their authority, could not prevail on the\r\nIndians to penetrate farther into the cavern. As the vault grew lower,\r\nthe cries of the guacharoes became more shrill. We were obliged to yield\r\nto the pusillanimity of our guides, and trace back our steps. We\r\nfollowed the course of the torrent to go out of the cavern. Before our\r\neyes were dazzled with the light of day, we saw without the grotto, the\r\nwater of the river sparkling amid the foliage of the trees that\r\nconcealed it. It was like a picture placed in the distance, and to which\r\nthe mouth of the cavern served as a frame. Having at length reached the\r\nentrance, and seated ourselves on the bank of the rivulet, we rested\r\nafter our fatigues. We were glad to be beyond the hoarse cries of the\r\nbirds, and to leave a place where darkness does not offer even the\r\ncharms of silence and tranquillity.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                             FINGAL’S CAVE,\r\n\r\n                        OR GRAND STAFFA CAVERN.\r\n\r\nStaffa, about seven miles north-north-east of Jona, and equidistant\r\nwestward from the shores of Mull, about one mile in length, and half a\r\nmile in breadth, is noted for the basaltic pillars which support the\r\nmajor part of the island, and for the magnificent spectacle afforded by\r\nthe cave of Fingal, one of the most splendid works of nature.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the contiguity of this wonderful island to Mull and\r\nIona, and the numerous vessels which navigate these seas, it was unknown\r\nto the world in general, and even to most of the neighboring islanders,\r\nuntil near the close of the last century, when Sir Joseph Banks, then on\r\nhis voyage to Iceland, in consequence of information received in the\r\nsound of Iona, from some gentlemen of Mull, was induced to sail thither.\r\nIt is, indeed, slightly mentioned by Buchanan; but assuredly it was not\r\nequally dead to fame at the time the Norwegians had sway in these parts,\r\nfor from them it derives its name of Staffa.\r\n\r\nThe basaltic pillars stand in natural colonnades, mostly above fifty\r\nfeet high, in the south-western part, upon a firm basis of solid\r\nunshapen rock: above these, the stratum, which reaches to the soil of\r\nthe island, varies in thickness, in proportion to the distribution of\r\nthe surface into hill and valley. The pillars are of three, four and\r\nmore sides; but the number of those with five and six exceeds that of\r\nthe others; one of seven sides measured by Sir Joseph, was four feet and\r\nfive inches in diameter.\r\n\r\nOn the west side of Staffa is a small bay, the spot where boats usually\r\nland. In this neighborhood occurs the first group of pillars: they are\r\nsmall, and instead of being placed upright, are recumbent on their\r\nsides, and form a segment of a circle. Further on is a small cave, above\r\nwhich pillars again are seen, of somewhat larger dimensions, which\r\nincline in all directions; in one place in particular, a small mass of\r\nthem much resembles the ribs of a ship. Beyond the cave is the first\r\ncontinued range of pillars, larger than the former, and opposite to them\r\nis a small island called Bhuachaile, (pronounced Boo-sha-’lay,) or the\r\nHerdsman’s isle, separated from the main by a channel not many fathoms\r\nwide. The whole of this islet is composed of pillars without any strata\r\nabove them; they are small, but by much the neatest formed of any in\r\nthis quarter.\r\n\r\nThe first division of this islet, for at high tide it is divided into\r\ntwo parts, makes a kind of cone, the pillars converging together toward\r\nthe center. On the other side the pillars are in general recumbent; and\r\nin the front, next the main, the beautiful manner in which they are\r\njoined is visible from their even extremities: all these have their\r\ntransverse sections exact, and their surfaces smooth; but with the\r\nlarger pillars the reverse is the case, and they are cracked in all\r\ndirections.\r\n\r\nThe main island opposite the Boo-sha-’lay, and thence toward the\r\nnorth-west, is entirely supported by ranges of pillars, pretty erect,\r\nwhich, although not apparently tall, from their not being uncovered to\r\nthe base, are of large diameter; at their feet is an irregular pavement,\r\nmade by the upper sides of such as have been broken off. This extends as\r\nfar under the water as the eye can reach.\r\n\r\nIn proceeding along the shore, the superb cavern of Fingal appears, for\r\nsuch is the denomination given it by the Highlanders, to whom it is\r\nknown. It is supported on each side by ranges of columns, and is roofed\r\nby the bottoms of such as have been broken away. From the interstices of\r\nthe roof a yellow stalactitic matter has exuded, which precisely defines\r\nthe different angles; and, varying the color, tends to augment the\r\nelegance of its appearance. What adds to the grandeur of the scene, the\r\nwhole cave is lighted from without, in such a manner, that the furthest\r\nextremity is plainly distinguished; while the air within, being\r\nconstantly in motion, owing to the flux and reflux of the tides, is\r\nperfectly dry and wholesome, and entirely exempt from the damp vapors to\r\nwhich natural caverns are generally subject. The following are its\r\ndimensions:\r\n\r\n                                                        Feet.    In.\r\n    Length of the cave from the rock without,             371      6\r\n    Length of the cave from the pitch of the arch,        250      0\r\n    Breadth of the cave at the mouth,                      53      7\r\n    Breadth of the cave at the further end,                20      0\r\n    Hight of the arch at the mouth,                       117      6\r\n    Hight of the arch at the end,                          70      0\r\n    Hight of an outside pillar,                            39      6\r\n    Hight of one at the north-west corner,                 54      0\r\n    Depth of water at the mouth,                           18      0\r\n    Depth of water at the extremity,                        9      0\r\n\r\nThe cave runs to the rock in the direction, by compass,\r\nnorth-north-east.\r\n\r\nThe mind can hardly form an idea more magnificent than such a space.\r\nAnd, indeed, speaking of the general aspect of Staffa, Sir Joseph is\r\nled, by his enthusiasm, to make the following reflections: “Compared to\r\nthis, what are the cathedrals or the palaces built by man! mere models\r\nor playthings, imitations as diminutive as his works will always be,\r\nwhen compared to those of Nature. Where is now the boast of the\r\narchitect! regularity, the only part in which he fancied himself to\r\nexceed his mistress, Nature, is here found in her possession, and here\r\nit has been left undescribed for ages. Is not this the school where the\r\nart was originally studied? And what has been added to this by the whole\r\nGrecian school? A capital to ornament the column of Nature, of which\r\nthey could execute a model only; and for that very capital they were\r\nobliged to a bush of acanthus. How amply does Nature repay those who\r\nstudy her wonderful works.”\r\n\r\nSuch were his feelings, and in this way did he moralize, when proceeding\r\nalong shore, and treading as it were on another Giant’s Causeway, he\r\narrived at the mouth of the cave.\r\n\r\nTo the north-west are found the highest range of pillars. Here they are\r\nbare to their base, and the stratum beneath is visible, as it rises\r\nseveral feet above the water. The surface of it is rough, with frequent\r\nlarge pieces of stone sticking in it, as if half immersed. The base,\r\nwhen broken, appears to be composed of many heterogenous parts, and much\r\nresembles lava. Many of the floating stones are of a similar substance\r\nwith the pillars, a coarse kind of basalt, less beautiful than that of\r\nthe Giant’s Causeway: the color is a dirty brown. The whole of this\r\nstratum dips gradually to the south-east.\r\n\r\nThe thickness of the stratum of lava-like matter below the pillars, the\r\nhight of the pillars, and the thickness of the superincumbent stratum,\r\nat three different places westward of the mouth of the cave, beginning\r\nwith the corner pillar of the cave, are described as follows by Sir\r\nJoseph Banks:\r\n\r\n                           Feet.  In.    Feet.  In.    Feet.  In.\r\n       Stratum below,         11    0       17    1       19    8\r\n       Hight of pillars,      54    0       50    0       55    1\r\n       Stratum above,         61    6       51    1       54    7\r\n\r\nThe stratum above the columns is uniformly the same, consisting of\r\nnumberless small pillars, bending and inclining in all directions,\r\nsometimes so irregularly, that the stones can only be said to have an\r\ninclination to assume a columnar form; in others more regularly; but\r\nnever breaking into, or disturbing the stratum of large pillars, whose\r\ntops keep everywhere an uniform line. On the opposite side of the island\r\nis a cavern, called Oua-na-scarve, or the Cormorant’s cave; here the\r\nstratum under the pillars is lifted up very high, and the pillars are\r\nconsiderably less than at the north-west side. Beyond, a bay cuts deep\r\ninto the island, rendering it not more than a quarter of a mile across.\r\nOn the sides of this bay, especially beyond a little valley, which\r\nalmost divides the island, are two stages of small pillars, with a\r\nstratum between, exactly resembling that above, formed of innumerable\r\nlittle pillars shaken out of their places, and leaning in all\r\ndirections. Beyond this, the pillars totally cease. The rock is of a\r\ndark-brown stone, without regularity, from the bay along the south-east\r\nend of the island; beyond which, a disposition to columnar formation is\r\nagain manifested, extending from the west side, but in an irregular\r\nmanner, to the bending pillars first described.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       OTHER GROTTOS AND CAVERNS.\r\n\r\nThere are few countries which have not to boast of a variety of natural\r\nexcavations; and these have, from their extent, structure, and the\r\ncurious phenomena they exhibit, in the formation of petrifactions, &c.,\r\nbeen at all times objects of popular attention. Among those particularly\r\ndeserving of notice are the following.\r\n\r\nThe volcanic country bordering on Rome, is peculiarly diversified by\r\nnatural cavities of great extent and coolness; on which last account it\r\nis related by Seneca, that the Romans were accustomed to erect seats in\r\ntheir vicinity, to enjoy their refreshing chillness in the summer\r\nseason. He gives a particular account of two such grottos belonging to\r\nthe villa of Vatia; and it was in a place of this kind that Tiberius was\r\nnearly destroyed while at supper. Its roof suddenly gave way, and buried\r\nseveral of his attendants in its ruins; which so alarmed the others,\r\nthat they fled and abandoned the emperor, with the exception of Sejanus,\r\nwho, stooping on his hands and knees, and covering the body of Tiberius\r\nwith his own, received all the stones which fell at that part from the\r\nroof, insomuch that, although he himself sustained considerable injury,\r\nthe emperor escaped unhurt.\r\n\r\nThe grottos of the Cevennes mountains, in lower Languedoc, are both\r\nnumerous and extensive. The principal one is not to be explored without\r\nmuch precaution, and without a safe guide. The entrance, which is low\r\nand narrow, leads to a spacious amphitheater, the petrifactions hanging\r\nfrom the roof of which have a most splendid effect by the light of\r\ntorches. Hence the visitor has to descend to several chambers, one of\r\nwhich is named the Chamber of the Winds; another, of Echo; another, of\r\nthe Cascade; another, again, of the Statue, &c.; on account of their\r\nexhibiting these different phenomena. In the grotto of Valori, at a\r\nsmall distance, the different natural curiosities which are to be found\r\nat every step, may be viewed at leisure, and without apprehension, as\r\nthe visitor never loses sight of the light at the entrance, and is,\r\ntherefore, not under any dread of not returning in safety. Here he is\r\ngratified by a view of the most singular petrifactions, representing\r\nflowers, fruits, bee-hives, and, in short, a variety of objects, in many\r\nof which the resemblance is nearly as accurate as if they had been\r\nsculptured.\r\n\r\nIn a wood, about five leagues from Besançon, in the province of France\r\ncalled Franche Comte, an opening, formed by two masses of rock, leads to\r\na cavern more than nine hundred feet beneath the level of the country.\r\nIt is in width sixty feet, and eighty feet high at the entrance, and\r\nexhibits inside an oval cavity of one hundred and thirty-five feet in\r\nbreadth, and one hundred and sixty-eight in length. To the right of the\r\nentrance is a deep and narrow opening, bordered with festoons of ice,\r\nwhich, distilling in successive drops on the bottom of the cavern, form\r\na mass of about thirty feet in diameter. A similar one, but somewhat\r\nsmaller, produced by the water which drips in less abundance from the\r\nimperceptible fissures in the roof, is seen on the left. The ground of\r\nthe cavern is perfectly smooth, and covered with ice eighteen inches\r\nthick; but the top, on the outside, is a dry and stony soil, covered\r\nwith trees, and on a level with the rest of the wood. The cold within\r\nthis cavern is so great, that, however warm the external atmosphere may\r\nbe when it is visited, it is impossible to remain in it for any length\r\nof time.\r\n\r\nThese natural ice-houses are not unfrequent in France and Italy, and\r\nsupply this agreeable luxury at a very cheap rate. Thus, in the same\r\nprovince, in the vicinity of Vesoul, is a cavern which, in the hot\r\nseason, when it is eagerly sought, produces more ice in one day, than\r\ncan be carried away in eight. It measures thirty-five feet in length,\r\nand in width sixty. The large masses of ice which hang pendent from the\r\nroof, have a very pleasing effect. When mists are observed in this\r\ncavern, they are regarded by the neighboring peasantry as infallible\r\nprognostics of rain; and it is worthy of observation, that although the\r\nwater in the interior is always frozen in the summer, it becomes liquid\r\nin the winter season.\r\n\r\nA grotto near Douse, also in Franche Comte, forms a similar ice-house,\r\nand is remarkable on account of the various forms of its congelations,\r\nwhich represent a series of columns, sustaining a curious vault, which\r\nappears to be carved with figures of men, animals, trees, &c.\r\n\r\nThe caverns of Gibraltar are numerous, and several of them of great\r\nextent. The one more particularly deserving attention is called St.\r\nMichael’s cave, situated on the southern part of the mountain. Its\r\nentrance is one thousand feet above the level of the sea, and is formed\r\nby a rapid slope of earth, which has fallen in at various periods, and\r\nwhich leads to a spacious hall, incrusted with spar, and apparently\r\nsupported in the center by a large stalactitical pillar. To this\r\nsucceeds a long series of caves, of difficult access. The passages\r\nleading from the one to the other are over precipices, which can not be\r\npassed without the aid of ropes and scaling-ladders. Several of these\r\ncaves are three hundred feet beneath the upper one; but at this depth\r\nthe smoke of the torches carried by the guides becomes so disagreeable,\r\nthat the visitor is obliged reluctantly to give up the pursuit, and\r\nleave other caves unexplored. In these cavernous recesses, the process\r\nand formation of the stalactites is to be traced, from the flimsy\r\nquilt-like cone suspended from the roof, to the robust trunk of a\r\npillar, three feet in diameter, which rises from the floor, and seems\r\nintended by nature to support the roof from which it originated.\r\n\r\nThe variety of forms which this matter takes in its different situations\r\nand directions, renders this subterraneous scenery strikingly grotesque,\r\nand in some places beautifully picturesque. The stalactites of these\r\ncaves, when near the surface of the mountain, are of a brownish yellow\r\ncolor; but, in descending toward the lower caves, they lose the darkness\r\nof their color, which is by degrees shaded off to a pale yellow.\r\nFragments are broken off, and, when wrought into different forms, and\r\npolished, are beautifully streaked and marbled.\r\n\r\nAbout seven English miles from Adlersberg, in Carniola, is a remarkable\r\ncavern, named St. Magdalen’s cave. The road being covered with stones\r\nand bushes, is very painful; but the great fatigue it occasions is\r\noverbalanced by the satisfaction of seeing so uncommon a cavern. The\r\nvisitor first descends into a hole, where the earth appears to have\r\nfallen in for ten paces, when he reaches the entrance, which resembles a\r\nfissure caused by an earthquake, in a huge rock. The torches are here\r\nlighted, the cave being extremely dark. This wonderful natural\r\nexcavation is divided into several large halls, and other apartments.\r\nThe vast number of pillars by which it is ornamented give it a superb\r\nappearance, and are extremely beautiful: they are as white as snow, and\r\nhave a semi-transparent luster. The bottom is of the same materials;\r\ninsomuch that the visitor may fancy he is walking beneath the ruins of\r\nsome stately palace, amid noble pillars and columns, partly mutilated,\r\nand partly entire. Sparry icicles are everywhere seen suspended from the\r\nroof, in some places resembling wax tapers, which, from their radiant\r\nwhiteness, appear extremely beautiful. All the inconvenience here arises\r\nfrom the inequality of the surface, which may make the spectator stumble\r\nwhile he is contemplating the beauties above and around him.\r\n\r\nIn the neighborhood of the village of Szelitze, in Upper Hungary, there\r\nis a very singular excavation. The adjacent country is hilly, and\r\nabounds with woods, the air being cold and penetrating. The entrance\r\ninto this cavern, fronting the south, is upward of one hundred feet in\r\nhight, and forty-eight in breadth, consequently sufficiently wide to\r\nreceive the south wind, which here generally blows with great violence;\r\nbut the subterraneous passages, which consist entirely of solid rock,\r\nwinding round, stretch still farther to the south. As far as they have\r\nbeen explored, their hight has been found to be three hundred feet, and\r\ntheir breadth about one hundred and fifty. The most inexplicable\r\nsingularity, however, is, that in the midst of winter the air in this\r\ncavern is warm; and when the heat of the sun without is scarcely\r\nsupportable, the cold within is not only very piercing, but so intense,\r\nthat the roof is covered with icicles of the size of a large cask,\r\nwhich, spreading into ramifications, form very grotesque figures. When\r\nthe snow melts in spring, the inside of the cave, where its surface is\r\nexposed to the south sun, emits a pellucid water, which congeals\r\ninstantly as it drops, and thus forms the above icicles: even the water\r\nwhich falls from them on the sandy ground, freezes in an instant. It is\r\nobserved, that the greater the heat is without, the more intense is the\r\ncold within; so that, in the dog-days, every part of this cavern is\r\ncovered with ice. In autumn, when the nights become cold, the ice begins\r\nto dissolve, insomuch that, when the winter sets in, it is no longer to\r\nbe seen; the cavern then is perfectly dry, and has a mild and gentle\r\nwarmth. It is, therefore, not surprising that swarms of flies, gnats,\r\nbats, owls, and even great numbers of foxes and hares, resort thither,\r\nas to their winter retreat, and remain there till the return of spring.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        MINES, METALS, GEMS, &C.\r\n\r\n         “Through dark retreats pursue the winding ore,\r\n         Search nature’s depths, and view the boundless store;\r\n         The secret cause in tuneful numbers sing,\r\n         How metals first were framed, and whence they spring:\r\n         Whether the active sun, with chymic flames,\r\n         Through porous earth transmits his genial beams\r\n         With heat impregnating the womb of night\r\n         The offspring shines with his paternal light:\r\n         Or whether, urged by subterraneous flames,\r\n         The earth ferments and flows in liquid streams;\r\n         Purged from their dross, the nobler parts refine,\r\n         Receive new forms, and with new beauty shine:\r\n         Or whether by creation first they sprung,\r\n         When yet unpoised the world’s great fabric hung:\r\n         Metals the bases of the earth were made,\r\n         The bars on which its fixed foundation’s laid:\r\n         All second causes they disdain to own,\r\n         And from the Almighty’s fiat sprung alone.”\r\n\r\nThe transition from the caverns and caves of the earth, to its MINES,\r\nand the various metals and gems they contain, is both natural and easy;\r\nand having dwelt on the former, we propose next to advert to the latter.\r\nBy the word “_mines_” we understand those excavations, in which metals,\r\nminerals and precious stones are sought and found; and according to the\r\nsubstances which they yield they are variously spoken of as “gold\r\nmines,” “silver mines,” “lead mines,” &c., &c. The richest and most\r\ncelebrated gold and silver mines are those of Mexico and Peru, in South\r\nAmerica, and those lately discovered in California and Australia. Iron\r\nmines are more abundant, or at least more abundantly worked, in Europe\r\nthan elsewhere, though the rapid increase of iron mining in the United\r\nStates gives promise that our country may in this respect some day rival\r\nthe old world. Copper mines have been found chiefly in England, Sweden\r\nand Denmark; and of late years copper has been found to be abundant in\r\nthe region of our northern lakes. Lead and tin mines are numerous in\r\nEngland, the latter chiefly in the county of Cornwall; and lead is also\r\nfound in abundance in the United States. Quicksilver mines abound\r\nprincipally in Hungary, Spain, Friuli, in the Venetian territories, and\r\nin Peru. Diamond mines are mainly in Brazil, and some in the East\r\nIndies; and salt mines are in Poland.\r\n\r\nTo explain the structure of mines, it should be observed that the\r\ninternal parts of the earth, as far as they have been investigated, do\r\nnot consist of any one uniform substance, but of various strata, or beds\r\nof substances, extremely different in their appearances, specific\r\ngravities and chemical qualities, one from another. Neither are these\r\nstrata similar to each other, either in their nature or appearance, in\r\ndifferent countries; insomuch that, even in the short extent of half a\r\nmile, sometimes, the strata will be found quite different in one from\r\nwhat they are in another place. As little are they the same either in\r\ndepth or solidity. Innumerable cracks and fissures are found in all of\r\nthem; and these again are so entirely different in size and shape, that\r\nit is impossible to form any inference from what may have been met with,\r\nrelative to that which remains to be explored.\r\n\r\nIn Cornwall, the most common opinion entertained by the miners, is, that\r\ncrude and immature minerals nourish and feed the ores with which they\r\nare intermixed in the mines; and that the minerals themselves will, in\r\nprocess of time, be converted into ores productive of those metals to\r\nwhich they have the nearest affinity, and with which they are most\r\nclosely intermingled. And a distinguished professor, who is familiar\r\nalike with geology, chemistry and mineralogy, after visiting the mining\r\ndistricts of California, has given it as his opinion, that gold is\r\nconstantly being formed there, by some powerful agency of nature which\r\nis still and steadily at work. And as a somewhat kindred view, Mr.\r\nPrice, in his mineralogy of Cornwall, thinks it is most reasonable to\r\nconclude, that metals were made and planted in veins, at, or very soon\r\nafter, the creation of the world; but that, in common with all other\r\nmatter, they are subject to a degree of fluctuation, approaching to, or\r\nreceding from, their ultimate degree of perfection, either quicker or\r\nslower, as they are of greater or less solid and durable frame and\r\nconstitution. He supposes in every metal a peculiar magnetism, and an\r\napproximation of particles of the same specific nature, by which its\r\ncomponent principles are drawn and united together; more particularly\r\nthe matters left by the decomposition of the waters passing through the\r\ncontiguous earths or strata, and deposited in their proper nidus or\r\nreceptacle, until, by the accretion of more or less of its homogeneous\r\nparticles, the metallic vein may be denominated either rich or barren.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             DIAMOND MINES.\r\n\r\nThe word _diamond_, is supposed to be a corruption of the word\r\n_adamant_, in allusion to the great hardness of this gem, which is the\r\nmost valuable of all the precious stones. Diamonds were originally\r\ndiscovered in Bengal, and in the island of Borneo; and about the year\r\n1720, were found in Brazil. They are found of all colors; and those\r\nwhich are colorless, or of some decided tint, are most esteemed, though\r\nthe latter kind are very rare. Those which are slightly discolored are\r\nthe least valuable.\r\n\r\nThe specific gravity of the diamond, is, to that of water, in the\r\nproportion of about three and a half to one. It is the hardest of all\r\nknown substances, and can only be cut and polished by its own dust or\r\npowder. The art of splitting or cutting and polishing this gem, though\r\nprobably of remote antiquity in Asia, was first introduced into Europe\r\nin 1486, by Louis Berghan, of Bruges, who accidentally discovered that\r\nby rubbing two diamonds together, their surfaces might be rendered\r\nsmooth. And the fine powder which is rubbed off by such friction, serves\r\nto grind and polish them. The diamond is of the nature of _charcoal_, or\r\npure carbon, and is combustible: under the blow-pipe it burns away in a\r\nblue, lambent flame.\r\n\r\nThe high value attached to diamonds does not depend so much on their\r\nbeauty and hardness, as on their great scarcity, and the labor and\r\nexpense necessary in procuring them. Hitherto they have been observed\r\nonly in the torrid zone; and Brazil is the only part of America in which\r\nthey have been found. The historical account of their discovery in that\r\ncountry is as follows. Near the capital of the territory of Serro do\r\nFrio flows the river Milho Verde, where it was the custom to dig for\r\ngold, or rather to extract it from the alluvial soil. The miners, during\r\ntheir search for gold, found several diamonds, which they were induced\r\nto lay aside in consequence of their particular shape and great beauty,\r\nalthough they were ignorant of their intrinsic value.\r\n\r\nThe diamond works on the river Jigitonhonha are described by Mr. Mawe as\r\nthe most important in the Brazilian territory. The river, in depth from\r\nthree to nine feet, is intersected by a canal, beneath the head of which\r\nit is stopped by an embankment of several thousand bags of sand, its\r\ndeeper parts being laid dry by chain-pumps. The mud is now washed away,\r\nand the =cascalhao=, or earth which contains the diamonds, dug up, and\r\nremoved to a convenient place for washing. The process, which is as\r\nfollows, is seen in the cut on the next page. A shed, consisting of\r\nupright posts which support a thatched roof, is erected in the form of a\r\nparallelogram, in length about ninety feet, and in width forty-five.\r\nDown the middle of its area a current of water is conveyed through a\r\ncanal covered with strong planks, on which the earth is laid to the\r\nthickness of two or three feet. On the other side of the area is a\r\nflooring of planks, from twelve to fifteen feet in length, imbedded in\r\nclay, extending the whole length of the shed, and having a gentle slope\r\nfrom the canal. This flooring is divided into about twenty compartments,\r\nor troughs, each about three feet wide, by means of planks placed on\r\ntheir edges; and the upper ends of these troughs communicate with the\r\ncanal, being so formed that water is admitted into them between two\r\nplanks about an inch separate from each other. Through this opening the\r\ncurrent falls about six inches into the trough, and may be directed to\r\nany part of it, or stopped at pleasure, by means of a small quantity of\r\nclay. Along the lower ends of the troughs a small channel is dug, to\r\ncarry off the water.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DIAMOND WASHING IN BRAZIL.]\r\n\r\nOn the heap of earth, at equal distances, three high chairs are placed\r\nfor the overseers, who are no sooner seated than the negroes enter the\r\ntroughs, each provided with a rake of a peculiar form, and having a\r\nshort handle, with which he rakes into the trough from fifty to eighty\r\npounds’ weight of the earth. The water being then allowed to pass in by\r\ndegrees, the earth is spread abroad, and continually raked up to the\r\nhead of the trough, so as to be kept in constant motion. This operation\r\nis continued for a quarter of an hour, when the water begins to run\r\nclearer; and, the earthy particles having been washed away, the\r\ngravel-like matter is raked up to the end of the trough. At length the\r\ncurrent flowing quite clear, the largest stones are thrown out, and\r\nafterward those of an inferior size; the whole is then examined with\r\ngreat care for diamonds. When a negro finds one, he instantly stands\r\nupright, and claps his hands; he then extends them, holding the gem\r\nbetween the fore-finger and the thumb. An overseer receives it from him,\r\nand deposits it in a bowl, suspended from the center of the structure,\r\nand half filled with water. In this vessel all the diamonds found in the\r\ncourse of the day are deposited, and at the close of the work are taken\r\nout and delivered to the principal overseer, who, after they have been\r\nweighed, registers the particulars in a book kept for that purpose.\r\n\r\nWhen a negro is so fortunate as to find a diamond of the weight of\r\nseventeen carats and a half, the following ceremony takes place: he is\r\ncrowned with a wreath of flowers, and carried in procession to the\r\nadministrator, who gives him his freedom by paying his owner for it. He\r\nalso receives a present of new clothes, and is permitted to work on his\r\nown account. For small stones proportionate premiums are given; while\r\nmany precautions are taken to prevent the negroes from stealing the\r\ndiamonds, with which view they are frequently changed by the overseers,\r\nlest these precious gems should be concealed in the corners of the\r\ntroughs. When a negro is suspected of swallowing a diamond, he is\r\nconfined in a solitary apartment, and means taken to bring the gem to\r\nlight.\r\n\r\nIn the East Indies, the kingdom of Golconda, extending two hundred and\r\nsixty miles along the bay of Bengal, and having a breadth of two hundred\r\nmiles from east to west, abounds in diamond mines. They are chiefly in\r\nthe vicinity of the rocky hills and mountains which intersect the\r\ncountry, and in the whole of which diamonds are supposed to be\r\ncontained. In several of the mines they are found scattered in the\r\nearth, within two or three fathoms of the surface, and in others are met\r\nwith in a mineral substance in the body of the rocks, forty or fifty\r\nfathoms deep. The laborers having dug five or six feet into the rock,\r\nsoften the stone by fire, and proceed till they find the vein, which\r\noften runs two or three furlongs under the rock. The earth being brought\r\nout and carefully searched, affords stones of various shapes, and of a\r\ngood water. This earth is of a yellowish, and sometimes of a reddish\r\ncolor, frequently adhering to the diamond with so strong a crust that\r\nthe separation becomes difficult.\r\n\r\nTo find the diamonds, the workmen form a cistern of a kind of clay, with\r\na small vent on one side, a little above the bottom; in this vent they\r\nplace a plug, and throwing into the cistern the earth they have dug,\r\npour in water to dissolve it. They then break the clods, and stir the\r\nwet earth in the cistern, allowing the lighter part to be carried off in\r\nthe form of mud, when the vent-hole is opened to let out the water. They\r\nthus continue washing, until what remains in the cistern is pretty\r\nclean; and then, in the middle of the day, when the sun shines bright,\r\ncarefully look over all the sand, at which practice they are so expert,\r\nthat the smallest stone can not escape them. The brightness of the sun\r\nbeing reflected by the diamonds, aids them in their research, which\r\nwould be foiled if a cloud were to intervene.\r\n\r\nThe largest known diamond was found in Brazil, and belongs to the king\r\nof Portugal. It weighs sixteen hundred and eighty carats; and, although\r\nuncut, it is valued at the enormous sum of two hundred and twenty-four\r\nmillions sterling, which gives an estimate of nearly eighty pounds\r\nsterling for each carat, the multiplicand of the square of its whole\r\nweight being taken. The one next in magnitude and value, is probably\r\nthat mentioned by Tavernier, in possession of the Great Mogul. It was\r\nfound in Golconda in 1550; is of the size of half a hen’s egg, and is\r\nsaid to weigh nine hundred carats. This diamond is the same as the\r\nfamous “_Koh-i-noor_,” or “Mountain of Light,” now belonging to the\r\nqueen of England, and which attracted so much attention in the great\r\nexhibition at London, in 1851. The one supposed to be next in value, is\r\nthat belonging to the crown jewels of Russia, which weighs seven hundred\r\nand seventy-nine carats, and has been estimated at five millions\r\nsterling. But perhaps the most perfect and beautiful diamond hitherto\r\nfound, is the one known as the Pitt diamond, which was brought from\r\nIndia by a gentleman of that name, who sold it to the Duke of Orleans\r\nfor one hundred thousand pounds sterling. It was worn by Bonaparte in\r\nthe hilt of his sword. It weighs about one hundred and thirty-six\r\ncarats, or five hundred and forty-four grains. It ought, however, to be\r\nobserved, that these estimates, founded on the magnitude and brilliancy\r\nof the gems, are very different from the prices which the most princely\r\nfortunes can afford to pay for them. The Russian diamond cost about one\r\nhundred and thirty five thousand pounds sterling; and the one called the\r\nPitt or Regent, although it weighed one hundred and thirty-six carats\r\nonly, was, on account of its greater brilliancy, purchased of a Greek\r\nmerchant, for one hundred thousand pounds sterling. Several other large\r\ndiamonds are preserved in the cabinets of the sovereigns and princes of\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nWhy such immense value should be attached to diamonds, in all civilized\r\ncountries, and by a kind of common consent, is one of those singular\r\nthings that seem inexplicable. That a magnificent house, with a large\r\nestate, and the means of living not only in comfort but splendor, should\r\nbe set in competition with, and even deemed inadequate to the purchase\r\nof, a transparent crystallized stone, not half the size of a hen’s egg,\r\nseems almost a kind of insanity! If for the mere consciousness of\r\npossessing a diamond of less than the weight of an ounce, any private\r\ngentleman were to pay four hundred and fifty thousand dollars in ready\r\nmoney, and an annuity of twenty thousand dollars besides, he would\r\nprobably be thought beside himself. And yet not only was the above sum\r\ngiven, but a patent of nobility into the bargain, by the empress\r\nCatharine, of Russia, for the famous diamond “Nadir Shah.” In this case,\r\nhowever, though the seller acquired much, the purchaser did not suffer\r\nany personal privation; and in reality, notwithstanding the costliness\r\nand high estimation of diamonds, they are not put in competition with\r\nthe substantial comforts and conveniences of life. Among ornaments and\r\nluxuries, however, they unquestionably occupy, and have ever occupied,\r\nthe highest rank. Even Fashion, proverbially capricious as she is, has\r\nremained steady in this, one of her earliest attachments, during\r\nprobably three or four thousand years. There must be, therefore, in the\r\nnature of things, some adequate reason for this universal consent; which\r\nbecomes a curious object of inquiry.\r\n\r\nThe utility of the diamond, great as it is in some respects, enters for\r\nlittle or nothing into the calculation of its price; at least all that\r\nportion of its value which constitutes the difference between the cost\r\nof an entire diamond and an equal weight of diamond powder, must be\r\nattributed to other causes.\r\n\r\nThe beauty of this gem, depending on its unrivaled luster, is, no doubt,\r\nthe circumstance which originally brought it into notice, and still\r\ncontinues to uphold it in the public estimation; and certainly,\r\nnotwithstanding the smallness of its bulk, there is not any substance,\r\nnatural or artificial, which can sustain any comparison with it in this\r\nrespect. The vivid and various refractions of the opal, the refreshing\r\ntints of the emerald, the singular and beautiful light which streams\r\nfrom the six-rayed star of the girasol, the various colors, combined\r\nwith high luster, which distinguish the ruby, the sapphire, and the\r\ntopaz, beautiful as they are on a near inspection, are almost entirely\r\nlost to a distant beholder; whereas the diamond, without any essential\r\ncolor of its own, imbibes the pure solar ray, and then reflects it,\r\neither with undiminished intensity, too white and too vivid to be\r\nsustained for more than an instant by the most insensible eye, or\r\ndecomposed by refraction into those prismatic colors, which paint the\r\nrainbow, and the morning and evening clouds, combined with a brilliancy\r\nwhich hardly yields to that of the meridian sun. Other gems, inserted\r\ninto rings and bracelets, are best seen by the wearer; and if they\r\nattract the notice of the bystanders, divide their attention, and\r\nwithdraw those regards which ought to be concentered on the person, to\r\nthe merely accessory ornaments. The diamond, on the contrary, whether\r\nblazing on the crown of state, or diffusing its starry radiance from the\r\nbreast of titled merit, or “in courts of feasts and high solemnities,”\r\nwreathing itself with the hair, illustrating the shape and color of the\r\nneck, and entering ambitiously into contest with the lively luster of\r\nthose eyes that “rain influence” on all beholders, blends harmoniously\r\nwith the general effect, and proclaims to the most distant ring of the\r\nsurrounding crowd, the person of the monarch, of the knight, or of the\r\nbeauty.\r\n\r\nAnother circumstance tending to enhance the value of the diamond is,\r\nthat although small stones are sufficiently abundant to be within the\r\nreach of moderate expenditure, and therefore afford, to all those who\r\nare in easy circumstances an opportunity to acquire a taste for\r\ndiamonds, yet those of a larger size are, and ever have been, rather\r\nrare; and of those which are celebrated for their size and beauty, the\r\nwhole number, at least in Europe, scarcely amounts to half a dozen, all\r\nof them being in possession of sovereign princes. Hence, the acquisition\r\neven of a moderately large diamond, is what mere money can not always\r\ncommand; and many are the favors, both political and of other kinds, for\r\nwhich a diamond of a large size, or of uncommon beauty, may be offered\r\nas a compensation, where its commercial price, in money, neither can be\r\ntendered, nor would be received. In many circumstances also, it is a\r\nmatter of no small importance for a person to have a considerable part\r\nof his property in the most portable form possible; and in this respect\r\nwhat is there that can be compared to diamonds, which possess the\r\nportability, without the risk of bills of exchange? It may further be\r\nremarked, in favor of this species of property, that it is but little\r\nliable to fluctuation, and has gone on pretty regularly increasing in\r\nvalue, insomuch that the price of stones of good quality is considerably\r\nhigher than it was some years ago.\r\n\r\nThe art of cutting and polishing diamonds, has a twofold object; first,\r\nto divide the natural surface of the stone in a symmetrical manner by\r\nmeans of highly polished polygonal planes, and thus to bring out, to the\r\nbest advantage, the wonderful refulgence of this beautiful gem; and,\r\nsecondly, by cutting out such flaws as may happen to be near the\r\nsurface, to remove those blemishes which materially detract from its\r\nbeauty, and consequently from its value. The removal of such flaws is a\r\nmatter of great importance; for, owing to the form in which the diamond\r\nis cut, and its high degree of refrangibility, the smallest fault is\r\nmagnified, and becomes obtrusively visible to all. For this reason,\r\nalso, it is by no means an easy matter, at all times, to ascertain\r\nwhether a flaw is or is not superficial; and a person with a correct and\r\nwell-practiced eye, may often purchase to great advantage, stones which\r\nappear to be flawed quite through, but which are in fact only\r\nsuperficially blemished.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving the subject of diamonds, it may be well to notice some\r\nother valuable stones that are much sought and prized for ornament. One\r\nof these is the _oriental ruby_. This, in its most esteemed color, is\r\npure carmine, or a blood-red of considerable intensity, forming, when\r\nwell polished, a blaze of the most exquisite and unrivaled tint. It is,\r\nhowever, more or less pale, and mixed with blue in various proportions;\r\nand hence it occurs rose-red, and reddish-white, crimson, peach-blossom\r\nred, and lilac-blue, the latter variety being named the _oriental\r\namethyst_. It is a native of Pegu, and is said to be found in the sand\r\nof certain streams near the capital of the country; and it also occurs,\r\nwith the sapphire, in the sands of the rivers of Ceylon. A ruby which is\r\nperfect both in color and transparency, is much less common than a good\r\ndiamond; and when of the weight of three or four carats, is even more\r\nvaluable than a diamond of the same size. The king of Pegu, and the\r\nmonarchs of Asia and Siam, monopolize the finest rubies, in the same way\r\nas the sovereigns of India make a monopoly of diamonds. The finest ruby\r\nin the world is in possession of the first of these kings. Its purity\r\nhas passed into a proverb, and its worth, when compared with gold, is\r\ninestimable. The dubah of Deccan, also, possesses a remarkably fine one,\r\nwhich is a full inch in diameter. The princes of Europe can not boast of\r\nany rubies of first-rate magnitude.\r\n\r\nThe _oriental sapphire_ ranks next in value to the ruby. When it is\r\nperfect, its color is a clear and bright Prussian blue, united to a high\r\ndegree of transparency. The _astoria_ or _star-stone_, is a remarkable\r\nvariety of this beautiful gem: it is semi-transparent, with a reddish\r\npurple tinge. And beside these, there are the _red_ sapphire, often\r\ncalled the oriental ruby, and the _yellow_ sapphire, which is called the\r\noriental topaz. And in addition to these precious stones, or gems, there\r\nare also the _emerald_, of a beautiful green color; the _topaz_, which\r\nis of a yellow or light wine-color, and which by being heated, sometimes\r\nbecomes rose-red, so as to be passed off as a ruby; the _jasper_ and\r\n_chalcedony_, which are of various colors; the _onyx_, which is a\r\nregularly banded agate, much prized for cameos, especially where the\r\ncolors are very distinct and different; the _cornelian_, which is\r\nproperly a red or flesh-colored chalcedony, much valued for seal-stones,\r\n&c.; and the _blood-stone_, or _heliotrope_, which is deep green, and\r\nsomewhat translucent, and variegated by blood-red spots: all of which\r\nare much used in the various departments of jewelry.\r\n\r\nWe have reserved for this place, a notice of the hot-well at Clifton,\r\nEngland, which would have been mentioned in connection with the Geysers\r\nand other hot springs, but from its connection with the beautiful\r\ncrystals known as _Bristol stones_ or _diamonds_, some of which are so\r\nhard as to cut glass, and are exceedingly clear, colorless and\r\nbrilliant. When set in rings, in their natural state, these stones often\r\nappear of as high a polish and luster, as if they had been wrought by\r\nthe most skillful lapidary.\r\n\r\nThe warm spring, or fountain, in the vicinity of which they are found,\r\nis called the _hot-well_. It is in the parish of Clifton, and is so\r\ncopious as to discharge sixty gallons of water in a minute. It rises\r\nforcibly from an opening in the solid rock, at about twenty-six feet\r\nbelow high-water mark. On its immediate influx from the rock, the water\r\nis much warmer than when it is pumped up for drinking, for it is raised\r\nby pumps some thirty feet. Its qualities in a medicinal point of view\r\nare supposed to be valuable; but it is not on this point that we propose\r\nto dwell, and therefore we pass on to the rocks in the neighborhood,\r\nnear which the _Bristol stones_ are found. Just below the hot-well,\r\nthere rises a noble range of hills, which are not more remarkable for\r\ntheir hight, than for their being equally so on both sides the river,\r\nthe strata in some places answering on each side for about a mile and a\r\nhalf in a serpentine course. These constitute one of the greatest\r\nnatural curiosities in England. The rock beyond the hot-well, and on the\r\nsame side, is named St. Vincent’s, a chapel dedicated to that saint\r\nhaving been formerly built on its summit. It is in hight three hundred\r\nfeet, and has a majestic appearance. It supplies the naturalist with\r\nmany curious fossils, the botanist with a variety of scarce plants, the\r\nantiquary with the remains of a Roman camp, and the less curious\r\ninquirer with a view of a most dreadful and surprising precipice.\r\n\r\nThe rocks in general, when broken up, are of a dusky red, brown or\r\nchocolate colored marble, very hard and close-grained, and which, on\r\nbeing struck with a hammer, emit a strong sulphureous smell. It will\r\nbear a polish equal to any foreign marble; and, when sawed into slabs\r\nand polished, appears beautifully variegated with veins of white,\r\nbluish-gray, or yellow. It is often employed for chimney-pieces; but it\r\nis principally used for making lime, for which purpose there is no stone\r\nin England so well calculated, nor is there any lime so strong, fine,\r\nand white, which excellent qualities occasion great demand for foreign\r\nconsumption.\r\n\r\nHere, and in the vicinity, laborers are daily employed in blowing up the\r\nrocks with gunpowder, by which process vast fragments are frequently\r\nthrown down, and repeatedly strike the precipice with a dreadful crash,\r\nwhich, combined with the loud report of the explosion, reëchoed from\r\nside to side by the lofty cliffs, makes a noise resembling thunder, for\r\nwhich it is frequently mistaken by strangers. It is the opinion of the\r\ngreater part of those who have viewed these rocks, that they were once\r\nunited, and were separated by some terrible convulsion of nature. A\r\nbridge of one arch, from rock to rock, over the Avon, has long been in\r\ncontemplation; but if the blowing up of these rocks should still be\r\npersisted in, the design will be rendered impracticable. This is the\r\nmore to be regretted, because stone of the same quality is to be\r\nprocured lower down the river.\r\n\r\nNow it is in the fissures and cavities of these rocks, that the\r\nbeautiful crystals called _Bristol stones_, or _diamonds_, already\r\nmentioned, are found. They are clear and brilliant, and being without\r\ncolor, so richly and brilliantly reflect the light, as to be almost next\r\nto the diamond in appearance, and are often palmed off on the\r\nunpracticed for the latter gem. They are extensively used in many of the\r\nplainer kinds of jewelry, and when set over gold-leaf, or thin paper of\r\ndelicate tinges, are often made closely to resemble some of the richest\r\ngems known.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       GOLD AND SILVER MINES.[4]\r\n\r\nThe mines of La Plata, so denominated on account of the abundance of\r\nsilver they contain, are chiefly situated in the provinces which were\r\nformerly attached to the Spanish viceroyalty of Rio de la Plata; but\r\nwhich, since the South American states revolted from the mother country,\r\nhave been included in the republic of Bolivia, or Upper Peru as it is\r\nsometimes called. With the exception of Mexico, Bolivia is the richest\r\ncountry in silver which has yet been discovered, and contains\r\ninnumerable mines both of that metal and of gold. All its northern\r\nprovinces teem with mineral opulence; and those of Laricaja and\r\nCarabaya, have been distinguished by the production of the latter, and\r\nstill nobler metal, in its virgin state. In consequence, however, of the\r\nrecent political convulsions, mining, once the richest source of\r\nrevenue, is in a depressed state; many of the mines being filled with\r\nwater and totally neglected.\r\n\r\nFootnote 4:\r\n\r\n  The account of the mines of South America and Mexico is mostly from\r\n  Humboldt, and as will be obvious to the reader, has reference in many\r\n  things to their past history and progress, rather than to their\r\n  present condition.\r\n\r\nThe mountain of Potosi formerly produced weekly about five thousand\r\nmarks of silver, that is, from thirty to forty thousand dollars; a\r\nsurprising produce, when it is considered that it has been wrought since\r\n1545, at which time it was accidentally discovered by an Indian, or\r\nnative, as represented in the cut. In hunting some goats, he slipped\r\nfrom a slight elevation, and to save himself caught hold of a shrub,\r\nwhich coming away from the ground, laid bare the silver at its root. At\r\nthe commencement it was still more abundant, and the metal was dug up in\r\na purer state.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DISCOVERY OF SILVER IN PERU.]\r\n\r\nThe silver was often found in shoots like roots, imbedded in the earth.\r\nSix thousand Indians were sent every eighteen months, from the provinces\r\nof the viceroyalty, to work this mine. The expedition was called _mita_;\r\nand these Indians, having been enrolled and formed into parties, were\r\ndistributed by the governor of Potosi, and received a small daily\r\nstipend, (equal to about thirty-four cents of our currency,) until the\r\nperiod of their labor was completed. They were thus doomed to a forced\r\nservice, nothing less than slavery, so long as it lasted, which the\r\nSpaniards have endeavored to justify by the plea that laborers could not\r\notherwise be procured.\r\n\r\nLumps of pure gold and silver, called =papas=, from their resemblance to\r\nthe potato, were often found in the sands. The poor likewise occupied\r\nthemselves in =lavaderos=, or in washing the sands of the rivers and\r\nrivulets, in order to find particles of the precious metals.\r\n\r\nTo compensate for the mines rendered useless by the irruption of water,\r\nor other accidents, rich and new ones were daily discovered. They were\r\nall found in the chains of mountains, commonly in dry and barren spots,\r\nand sometimes in the sides of the =quebredas=, or astonishing\r\nprecipitous breaks in the ridges. However certain this rule might be in\r\nthe region of Bolivia, it was contradicted in that of Peru, where, at\r\nthree leagues’ distance from the Pacific ocean, not far from Tagna, in\r\nthe province of Arica, there was discovered the famous mine of\r\nHuantajaya, in a sandy plain at a distance from the mountains, of such\r\nexuberant wealth that the pure metal was cut out with a chisel. From\r\nthis mine a large specimen of virgin silver is preserved in the royal\r\ncabinet of natural history at Madrid. It attracted a considerable\r\npopulation, although neither water nor the common conveniences for labor\r\ncould be found there, neither any pasturage for the cattle.\r\n\r\nIn the mint of Potosi, about six millions of dollars were annually\r\ncoined; and the mines of the old viceroyalty of La Plata, taken\r\ncollectively, are reckoned to have yielded about sixteen millions.\r\n\r\nThe mines of Mexico, or what was formerly called New Spain, have been\r\nmore celebrated for their riches than those of La Plata, notwithstanding\r\nwhich they are remarkable for the poverty of the mineral they contain. A\r\nquintal, or sixteen hundred ounces of silver ore, affords, at a medium,\r\nnot more than three or four ounces of pure silver, about one-third of\r\nwhat is yielded by the same quantity of mineral in Saxony. It is not,\r\ntherefore, on account of the richness of the ore, but from its abundance\r\nand the facility of working it, that these mines have been so much\r\nsuperior to those of Europe.\r\n\r\nThe fact of the small number of persons employed in working them, is not\r\nless contrary to the commonly received opinion on this subject. The\r\nmines of Guanaxuato, infinitely richer than those of Potosi ever were,\r\nafforded from 1706 to 1803, nearly forty millions of dollars in gold and\r\nsilver, or very nearly five millions of dollars annually, being somewhat\r\nless than one-fourth of the whole quantity of gold and silver from New\r\nSpain; notwithstanding which, these mines, productive as they were, did\r\nnot employ more than five thousand workmen of every description. In\r\nMexico, the labor of the mines was perfectly free, and better paid than\r\nany other kind of industry, a miner earning from five to five dollars\r\nand a half weekly, while the wages of the common laborer did not exceed\r\na dollar and a half. The =tenateros=, or persons who carried the ore on\r\ntheir backs, from the spot where it was dug out of the mine, to that\r\nwhere it was collected in heaps, had a sum equal to a dollar and ten\r\ncents for a day’s work of six hours. Neither slaves, criminals, nor\r\nforced laborers, were employed in the Mexican mines.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the clumsy, imperfect and expensive mode of clearing\r\nthem from water, several of the richest of these mines have been\r\noverflowed and abandoned; while the lack of method in the arrangement of\r\nthe galleries, and the absence of lateral communications, have added to\r\nthe risk, and greatly increased the expense of working them. Labor has\r\nnot been, as in the working of the European mines, abridged, nor the\r\ntransportation of materials facilitated. When new works were undertaken,\r\na due consideration was not bestowed on the preliminary arrangements;\r\nand they were always conducted on too large and expensive a scale.\r\n\r\nMore than three-fourths of the silver obtained from America is\r\nextricated from the ore by means of quicksilver, the loss of which, in\r\nthe process of amalgamation, is immense. The quantity that used to be\r\nconsumed annually in Mexico alone, was about sixteen thousand quintals;\r\nand in the whole of South America, about twenty-five thousand quintals\r\nwere yearly expended, the cost of which there, has been estimated at\r\nmore than a million dollars. The greater part of this quicksilver, in\r\nlater years, was furnished by the mine of Almaden in Spain, and that of\r\nIstria in Carniola, the celebrated quicksilver mine of Huancavelica in\r\nPeru, having greatly fallen off in its produce since the sixteenth\r\ncentury, when it was highly flourishing. The prosperity of the silver\r\nmines, both in Mexico and Peru, therefore depended very much on the\r\nsupplies of quicksilver from Spain, Germany and Italy; for such was the\r\nabundance of the ore in those provinces, that apparently the only limit\r\nto the amount of silver obtained there, was the want of mercury for\r\namalgamation.\r\n\r\nIn taking a general view of the riches of the other portions of America,\r\nHumboldt, who has supplied these details, remarks that, in Peru, silver\r\nore exists in as great abundance as in Mexico, the mines of Lauricocha\r\nbeing capable of yielding as great a produce as those of Guanaxuato; but\r\nthat the art of mining, and the methods of separating the silver from\r\nits ore, are still more defective than in Mexico. Notwithstanding this\r\nimperfect system, the total amount of the precious metals annually\r\nfurnished by America, was at one time estimated at upward of forty-two\r\nmillion dollars; the gold being in proportion to the silver as one to\r\nforty-six. From 1492 to 1803, the quantity of gold and silver extracted\r\nfrom the American mines, was equal in value to five billion, seven\r\nhundred and six million, seven hundred thousand dollars; of which\r\nimmense sum, the portion carried to Europe, including the booty gathered\r\nby the conquerors of America, is estimated at five billion, four hundred\r\nand forty-five million dollars, averaging seventeen million and a half\r\nof dollars yearly. The annual importation up to 1803, being divided into\r\nsix periods, appears to have constantly augmented, and in the following\r\nprogressive ratio. From 1492 to 1500, it did not exceed two hundred and\r\nfifty thousand dollars. From 1500 to 1545, it amounted to three millions\r\nof dollars. From 1545 to 1600, to eleven millions. From 1600 to 1700, to\r\nsixteen millions. From 1700 to 1750, to twenty-two millions and a half.\r\nAnd, lastly, from 1750 to 1803, to the prodigious sum of thirty-five\r\nmillion, three hundred thousand dollars.\r\n\r\nThe first period was that of exchange with the natives, or of mere\r\nrapine. The second was distinguished by the conquest and plunder of\r\nMexico, Peru and New Granada, and by the opening of the first mines. The\r\nthird began with the discovery of the rich mines of Potosi; and in the\r\ncourse of it the conquest of Chili was completed, and various mines\r\nopened in Mexico. At the commencement of the fourth period, the mines of\r\nPotosi began to be exhausted; but those of Lauricocha were discovered,\r\nand the produce of Mexico rose from two millions to five millions of\r\ndollars annually. The fifth period began with the discovery of gold in\r\nBrazil; and the sixth was distinguished by the prodigious increase of\r\nthe mines of Mexico, while those of every other part of America, with\r\nthe exception of Brazil, were then constantly improving.\r\n\r\nThe gold mines of Brazil have been very productive. Those called\r\ngeneral, were about seventy-five leagues from Rio Janeiro, the staple\r\nand principal outlet of the riches of the Brazilian territory. They\r\nformerly yielded to the king, annually, for his right of fifths, at\r\nleast one hundred and twelve arobas (weighing twenty-five pounds each)\r\nof gold; so that their yearly produce might then have been estimated at\r\nupward of three and a half millions of dollars, and that of the more\r\ndistant mines at about one-third the sum.\r\n\r\nThe gold drawn from them could not be carried to Rio Janeiro, without\r\nbeing first brought to the smelting-houses established in each district,\r\nwhere the right of the crown was received. What belonged to private\r\npersons was remitted in bars, with their weight, number, and an\r\nimpression of the royal arms. The gold was then assayed, and its\r\nstandard imprinted on each bar. When these bars were carried to the\r\nmint, their value was paid to the possessor in coin, commonly in\r\nhalf-doubloons, each worth eight Spanish dollars. Upon each of these\r\nhalf-doubloons the king gained a dollar, by the alloy and right of\r\ncoinage. The mint of Rio Janeiro was one of the most beautiful in\r\nexistence, and furnished with every convenience for working with the\r\ngreatest celerity. As the gold came from the mines at the same time that\r\nthe fleets came from Portugal, the operations of the mint and the\r\ncoinage proceeded with surprising quickness.\r\n\r\nIn Africa, the kingdom of Mozambique abounds in gold, which is washed\r\ndown by the rivers, and forms a chief part of the commerce of the\r\ncountry. The kingdoms of Monomotara and Sofala likewise furnish\r\nconsiderable quantities of gold; and the Portuguese residing in the\r\nlatter territory, half a century ago, reported that it yielded annually\r\ntwo millions of =metigals=, equal to somewhat more than a million\r\nsterling. The merchants exported from Mecca, and other parts, about the\r\nsame quantity of gold. The soldiers were paid in gold dust, in the state\r\nin which it was collected; and this was so pure, and of so fine a\r\nyellow, as not to be exceeded, when wrought, by any other gold beside\r\nthat of Japan. Gold is likewise found on the island of Madagascar. The\r\nGold Coast is so denominated from the abundance of gold found among the\r\nsands: it is not, however, so productive as has been generally supposed,\r\nowing to the intense heats, which, in a great measure, prevent the\r\nnatives from prosecuting their researches.\r\n\r\nIn Asia, the island of Japan is most productive of gold, which is found\r\nin several of its provinces, and is, in by far the greater proportion,\r\nmelted from its ore. It is also procured by washing the sands, and a\r\nsmall quantity is likewise found in the ore of copper. The emperor\r\nclaims a supreme jurisdiction, not only over the gold mines, but over\r\nall the mines of the empire, which are not allowed to be worked without\r\na license from him. Two-thirds of their produce belong to him, and the\r\nother third is left to the governor of the province in which the mines\r\nare situated. But the richest gold ore, and that which yields the finest\r\ngold, is dug in one of the northern provinces of the island of Niphon, a\r\ndependency of Japan, where the gold mines have, in past times, been\r\nhighly productive, though now they have much fallen off. In the Japanese\r\nprovince of Tsckungo, a rich gold mine, having been filled with water,\r\nwas no longer worked: as it was, however, so situated, that by cutting\r\nthe rock and making an opening beneath the mine, the water could be\r\neasily drawn off, this was attempted. At the moment of beginning the\r\noperation, so violent a storm of thunder and lightning arose, that the\r\nworkmen were obliged to seek shelter elsewhere; and these superstitious\r\npeople imagining that the tutelar god and protector of the spot,\r\nunwilling to have the bowels of the earth thus rifled, had raised the\r\nstorm to make them sensible of his great displeasure at such an\r\nundertaking, desisted from all further attempts, through the fear of\r\nincurring his displeasure, and could not be induced to go on with it.\r\n\r\nThibet, a mountainous country of India, contains a great abundance of\r\ngold, which is traced in the rivers flowing from that territory into the\r\nGanges. In Hindoostan there are not any mines of gold; but in the Irnada\r\ndistrict gold is collected in the river which passes Nelambur in the\r\nMangery Talui, a nair having the exclusive privilege of this collection,\r\nfor which he pays a small annual tribute. Silver is in general rare\r\nthroughout the oriental regions, and there is not any indication of this\r\nmetal in India; but in Japan there are several silver mines, more\r\nparticularly in the northern provinces, and the metal extracted from\r\nthem is very pure and fine.\r\n\r\nTurning to Europe, Dalmatia is said in ancient times to have produced an\r\nabundance of gold. Pliny reports that in the reign of the emperor Nero,\r\nfifty pounds of this precious metal were daily taken from the mines of\r\nthat province; and that it was found on the surface of the ground. It is\r\nadded, that Vibius, who was sent by Augustus to subdue the Dalmatians,\r\nobliged that hardy and warlike people to work in the mines, and to\r\nseparate the gold from the ore.\r\n\r\nBossina, in Sclavonia, contains many mineral mountains, and has rich\r\nmines of gold and silver. The district in which the latter are found, is\r\nnamed the =Srebrarniza=, being derived from the word =srebr=, which\r\nsignifies silver in all the Sclavonian dialects. Their produce resembles\r\nthe native silver of Potosi, and is found, combined with pure quartz, in\r\nsmall, thin leaves, resembling moss.\r\n\r\nThe kingdom of Norway formerly produced gold; but the expense of working\r\nthe mines, and procuring the pure ore, being greater than the profit,\r\nthese have been neglected. There are, however, silver mines, which are\r\nextremely valuable, and give employment to several thousands of persons.\r\nThe principal of these is at Königsberg, and was discovered in 1623,\r\nwhen the town was immediately built, and peopled with German miners. In\r\n1751, forty-one shafts and twelve veins, were wrought in this mine, and\r\ngave employment to thirty-five hundred officers, artificers and\r\nlaborers. A view of one part of this mine is given in the cut on the\r\nnext page.\r\n\r\nThe silver ore is not, as was at first imagined, confined to the\r\nmountain between Königsberg and the river Jordal, but extends its veins\r\nfor several miles throughout the adjacent districts, in consequence of\r\nwhich new mines have been undertaken in several places, and prosperously\r\ncarried on. One of the richest and most ancient of the mines, named “Old\r\nGod’s blessing,” has sometimes, in the space of a week, yielded several\r\nhundred pounds’ weight of rich ore. The astonishing depth of this mine,\r\nwhich is not less than a hundred and eighty fathoms, perpendicularly,\r\nfills the mind of the beholder with amazement; and the circumference at\r\nthe bottom forms a clear space of several hundreds of fathoms. Here the\r\nsight of thirty or forty fires, burning on all sides in this gloomy\r\ncavern, and continually fed to soften the stone in the prosecution of\r\nthe labors, seems, according to the notions commonly entertained, an apt\r\nimage of hell; and the swarms of miners, covered with soot, and bustling\r\nabout in habits according to their several employments, may well remind\r\none of so many evil spirits; more especially when, at a given signal\r\nthat the mine is to be sprung in this or that direction, they exclaim\r\naloud: “=Berg-livet, berg-livet=!” “Take care of your lives.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SILVER MINE AT KÖNIGSBERG.]\r\n\r\nThe gold mines of Cremnitz, in Hungary, lie forty miles south of the\r\nCarpathian hills; and twenty miles further to the south are the silver\r\nmines of Shemnitz. These are called mining towns; and the former is the\r\nprincipal, its rich ores being found in what is styled metallic rock.\r\nIts mines also produce a certain proportion of silver. Hungary is beside\r\nenriched by a mineral peculiar to itself, or one, at least, which has\r\nnot hitherto been discovered elsewhere, namely, the _opal_, a gem\r\npreferred to all others by the oriental nations. The opal mines are\r\nsituated at Ozerwiniza, where they are found in a hill consisting of\r\ndecomposed porphyry, a few fathoms beneath the surface. Their produce is\r\nof various qualities, from the opaque-white, or semi-opal, to the utmost\r\nrefulgence of the lively colors by which this noble gem is\r\ndistinguished.\r\n\r\nTransylvania and the Bannet, contain numerous and valuable mines,\r\nconsisting chiefly of gray gold ore, and white gold ore. The finest gold\r\nis found at Olapian, not far from Zalathna, intermixed with gravel and\r\nsand. The sands of the Rhine, also, in various places contain traces of\r\ngold.\r\n\r\nThe mountains of Spain were, according to ancient writers, very rich in\r\ngold and silver; and accordingly Gibbon calls that kingdom, “the Peru\r\nand Mexico of the old world.” He adds, that “the discovery of the rich\r\nwestern continent of the Phenicians, and the oppression of the simple\r\nnatives, who were compelled to labor in their own mines for the benefit\r\nof strangers, form an exact type of the more recent history of Spanish\r\nAmerica.” The Phenicians were acquainted only with the sea-coasts of\r\nSpain; but avarice, as well as ambition, carried the arms of Rome and\r\nCarthage into the heart of the country, and almost every part of the\r\nsoil was found pregnant with gold, silver and copper. A mine near\r\nCarthagena, is said to have yielded daily twenty-five thousand drams of\r\nsilver, or over thirteen hundred thousand dollars a year. The provinces\r\nof Asturia, Gallicia and Lusitania, yielded twenty thousand pounds’\r\nweight of gold annually: but rich as these mines are, the modern\r\nSpaniards have chosen rather to import the precious metals from America,\r\nthan to seek them at home.\r\n\r\nPortugal is in many parts mountainous; and these mountains contain,\r\nbeside others, rich ores of silver. But the Portuguese, like the\r\nSpaniards, having been supplied with metals from South America, and\r\nparticularly with an abundance of gold and silver from Brazil, have not\r\nworked the mines in their own country. Gems of all kinds, as turkoises\r\nand hyacinths, are also found in these mountains, together with\r\nbeautifully variegated marbles, and many curious fossils.\r\n\r\nBut the richest and most productive gold mines of Europe, at the present\r\ntime, are probably those of Russia. It had long been known that gold was\r\nto be found in the Russian dominions; but in 1829, Baron Humboldt, with\r\ntwo scientific associates, at the request of the emperor of Russia, made\r\na mineralogical tour to the Ural and Altai mountains. In this journey,\r\nthey not only discovered new localities of gold and silver, but from the\r\ngeological features of the country suggested that, at certain\r\nlocalities, diamonds would also probably be found, which accordingly\r\nhappened. And as the result of the report they made to the Russian\r\ngovernment, mining operations were commenced on a large scale in these\r\nmountains, which have now become one of the most prolific gold regions\r\nin the world. The increase of these sources of gold, in extent and\r\namount, has been such, that from the value of about ten thousand dollars\r\nin 1836, the amount received in 1843, was some eighteen millions of\r\ndollars; and the supply has since increased annually, until at present,\r\n1855, it amounts to about twenty million dollars a year. Most of this\r\nlarge amount of gold is gathered from washing the sand and loose earth,\r\nand not from deep mines; and as it is every year becoming greater and\r\ngreater, it must add immensely to the wealth and resources of the\r\nRussian empire.\r\n\r\nBut by far the greatest gold-field in the world, has been opened by the\r\ndiscoveries of the last few years in California. At the close of the\r\nlate war with Mexico, the United States acquired, by conquest and\r\npurchase, a tract of country of some five hundred thousand square miles\r\nin extent, known as the Mexican territory of upper California. And from\r\nthe western portion of this region, Congress, in 1850, created and\r\nadmitted into the American confederacy, the thirty-first state, under\r\nthe name of California. It is almost superfluous to say, that California\r\nis one of the most important mineral regions in the world, particularly\r\nin its deposits of gold. Vague notions of the existence of this gold,\r\nhad from time to time been spread abroad; but it was not till 1848, that\r\nan accident discovered the marvelous fact of its abundance. In that\r\nyear, a Mr. Sutter, a native of Switzerland, was settled near the mouth\r\nof the American fork of the Sacramento river, at the head of navigation,\r\none hundred and fifty miles from its mouth. Here he had founded New\r\nHelvetia, and obtained a grant of thirty miles round. He had sent some\r\nmen to the upper part of the American fork, to clear out a mill-race.\r\nThe soil was washed down in the process, and some shining scales laid\r\nbare. These proved to be gold, and on investigation, not only the valley\r\nof this stream, but the beds of all the other streams running into the\r\nSacramento, were found to have a soil full of gold, in minute scales and\r\nin bits, from a grain to many ounces in weight. New “placers,” as the\r\n“washings,” or “dry diggings” are called, have constantly been\r\ndiscovered, and people have rushed to these hills from all quarters,\r\nwith pans, tubs, pickaxes, shovels, hoes, filtering-machines, and\r\nenergetic sinews, till they have extracted, by digging, washing, &c.,\r\nmillions on millions of dollars’ worth of the yellow treasure. Gold is\r\nnow found over an extent of many hundred miles, and also on the Gila,\r\nand throughout the great central plateau, north and north-east of it.\r\n\r\nIn a favorable locality, the lucky finder of a placer will sift out\r\nhundreds of dollars’ worth in a day. Persons with not a shirt to their\r\nbacks, and scarcely a whole garment upon them, are seen with bags of\r\ngold in their hands. Prices of everything went up at once to an enormous\r\nrate: laborer’s wages became eight or ten dollars a day; cooks at the\r\ndiggings, ten dollars a day; clerks, fifteen hundred dollars to six\r\nthousand dollars =per annum=, &c., &c. As all the productive industry of\r\nthe country is now turned to gold-digging, and as such vast numbers of\r\nconsumers are flocking in from all parts, prices continue to range high\r\nfor every article of necessity, although such large quantities of goods\r\nhave been sent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GOLD WASHING IN CALIFORNIA.]\r\n\r\nThe gold first discovered was evidently not in its original place, but\r\nhad been washed down from higher regions; and when all that is thus\r\nspread through the sands of California shall have been exhausted, if it\r\never shall be, there are large bodies of auriferous quartz, which (with\r\ngreater labor and expense) will doubtless afford large supplies of gold\r\nfor generations to come. The amount of capital invested in\r\nquartz-mining, according to the state census of 1852, was about six\r\nmillions, and in placer and other mining operations, about four millions\r\nof dollars; and the sum total of these amounts has been greatly\r\nincreased since that date. Up to the close of 1851, there had been\r\ndeposited in the United States mint, $98,407,990 of California gold; and\r\nthe deposits of 1852 amounted to $46,528,076, making a total of\r\n$145,000,000. But all this falls far short of the real amount produced;\r\nas probably quite as much more has been sent to Europe in the shape of\r\ndust or bullion, not to mention the unreported sums which have been\r\nprivately taken out of the state. An official estimate states the\r\nproduction of American gold in 1853, at $109,156,748; and of this sum\r\nnearly the whole is from the mines of California. And this vast amount\r\nis steadily on the increase, in about the proportion of the increase of\r\nthe mining population, so that California not only is, but is likely to\r\ncontinue to be _the great gold-field_ of the world.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving California, it may not be amiss to add, that the country\r\nabounds in mines of almost every kind, as well as gold. Quicksilver,\r\nplaster, lead, iron, silver, copper, asphaltum and marble, are found in\r\nButte, and also in Marion county; rich silver mines and coal, in San\r\nLouis Obispo; copious salt springs, in Shasta; bituminous springs, in\r\nmany places along the coast; hot sulphur springs, in Santa Barbara; warm\r\nsoda springs, near Benicia; and platina is said to be widely distributed\r\nin almost every section where gold has been found. Silver has been\r\ndiscovered in several mines in the southern district; copper is widely\r\ndistributed in other sections beside those above-mentioned; chromium\r\noccurs in large quantities in the serpentine rocks; and diamonds are\r\nreported to have been recently found in several localities.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLACE WHERE GOLD WAS FIRST DISCOVERED IN AUSTRALIA.]\r\n\r\nAt a date still later than the discovery of gold in California, the same\r\nprecious metal was discovered in Australia. The cut on the following\r\npage gives a view of the place where it was first found, in the county\r\nof Bathurst, not far from Sydney in New South Wales. It is worthy of\r\nnote that we owe the discovery of gold in Australia to the high state of\r\ngeological science. Sir R. Murchison, in his address to the London\r\nGeographical Society in 1844, alluded to the possibly auriferous\r\ncharacter of the great eastern chain of Australia, being led thereto by\r\nhis knowledge of the auriferous chain of the Ural, and by his\r\nexamination of Count Strzelecki’s specimens, maps and sections. Some of\r\nSir R. Murchison’s observations having found their way to the Australian\r\npapers, a Mr. Smith, at that time engaged in some iron works at Berrima,\r\nwas induced by them in the year 1849 to search for gold, and he found\r\nit. He sent the gold to the colonial government, and offered to disclose\r\nits locality on payment of five hundred pounds sterling. The government,\r\nhowever, not putting full faith in the statement, and being, moreover,\r\nunwilling to encourage a gold fever without sufficient reason, declined\r\nto grant the sum, but offered, if Mr. Smith would mention the locality,\r\nand the discovery was found to be valuable, to reward him accordingly.\r\nVery unwisely, as it turned out, Mr. Smith did not accept this offer;\r\nand it remained for Mr. Hargraves, who came with the prestige of his\r\nCalifornia experience, to make the discovery anew, and get the reward\r\nfrom the English government on their own conditions. The first discovery\r\nwas made in the banks of the Summer Hill creek and the Lewis Ponds\r\nriver, small streams which run from the northern flank of the Conobalas\r\ndown to the Macquarrie. The gold was found in the sand and gravel\r\naccumulated, especially on the inside of the bends of the brook, and at\r\nthe junction of the two water-courses, where the stream of each would be\r\noften checked by the other. It was coarse gold, showing its parent site\r\nto be at no great distance, and probably in the quartz veins traversing\r\nthe metamorphic rocks of the Conobalas. Mr. Stutchbury, the government\r\ngeologist, reported on the truth of the discovery, and shortly afterward\r\nfound gold in several other localities, especially on the banks of the\r\nTuron, some distance north-east of the Conobalas. This was a much wider\r\nand more open valley than the Summer Hill creek, and the gold\r\naccordingly was much finer, occurring in small scales and flakes. It\r\nwas, however, more regularly and equably distributed through the soil,\r\nso that a man might reckon with the greatest certainty on the quantity\r\nhis daily labor would return him. At the head of the Turon river, among\r\nthe dark glens and gullies in which it collects its head-waters, in the\r\nflanks of the Blue mountains, the gold got “coarser,” occurred in large\r\nlumps or nuggets, but these were more sparingly scattered.\r\n\r\nAs already said, the discovery was made by Mr. Hargraves, in May, 1850;\r\nand before the end of June, there were more than twenty thousand persons\r\nat the mines. When it was known in the town of Bathurst, that the\r\ndiscovery had been made, and that the country, from the mountain ranges,\r\nback to an indefinite extent in the interior, was probably one immense\r\ngoldfield, the excitement was intense and universal. A complete phrensy\r\nseemed to seize on the entire population; the business of the town was\r\nparalyzed; and there was a universal rush to the diggings. People of all\r\ntrades, callings and pursuits were quickly transformed into miners; and\r\nmany a hand which had been trained to kid gloves, or accustomed only to\r\nthe quill, became nervous to clutch the pick or crowbar, or to “rock the\r\ncradle” at the newly discovered mines. The roads were literally alive\r\nwith the crowds pressing on from every quarter, some armed with\r\npickaxes, others shouldering crowbars and shovels, and not a few strung\r\nround with hand-basins, tin-pots and cullenders. Scores rushed from\r\ntheir homes, with only a blanket, and a pick or grubbing-hoe, full of\r\nhope that a few days would give them heaps of the precious metal.\r\nEverything at once rose in price, and the whole face of society was\r\nspeedily changed in almost every aspect.\r\n\r\nThe first pieces found were in grains. Soon a piece was picked up\r\nweighing some eleven ounces; and soon after, several lumps weighing\r\ntogether about three pounds. Gold was speedily discovered in almost\r\nevery place where it was looked for; in the beds of the streams, and in\r\nveins of quartz, in grains, in scales, and in lumps of various weights.\r\nSome, as might be expected, were successful, and some comparatively\r\nunsuccessful in seeking it; the great mass of the miners averaging not\r\nmore than four or five dollars a day, while in some rare cases a single\r\nindividual gathered to the value of a thousand dollars in the same time.\r\nGold was soon discovered in the Wellington district, and in various\r\nother places. One piece was picked up weighing almost five pounds; and\r\nfrom a single cleft in a rock, a miner took out eleven pounds’ weight of\r\ngold, in separate pieces of various sizes. A Scotchman gathered fourteen\r\nhundred dollars’ worth in four days, and eight of his associates\r\naveraged from thirty to forty dollars’ worth a day. Apparently there is\r\nno end to the supply, at least for years to come; and all this within\r\nforty miles of a town where every comfort, not to say luxury, can be\r\nobtained, with a good post-road all the way to Sydney, and in the midst\r\nof tracts of the most fertile land, partly occupied, and where food may\r\nbe supplied for millions of inhabitants, if needed. An official\r\nstatement estimates the supply of Australian gold at sixty million\r\ndollars a year; and in addition to the gold, diamonds and platinum have\r\nalso been found. Australia and California are likely to be the great\r\nsources of the supply of gold, compared with which all others will be\r\nrelatively unimportant.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving the subject of gold, it may be interesting to the reader\r\nto trace the process of its coinage, which may thus be briefly stated.\r\nThe metal, after being received in the deposit-room, is carefully\r\nweighed, and a receipt given. Each deposit is then melted separately in\r\nthe melting-room, and molded into bars. These bars next pass through the\r\nhands of the assayer, who with a chisel chips a small fragment from each\r\none. Each chip is then rolled into a thin ribbon, and filed down until\r\nit weighs exactly ten grains. It is then melted into a little cup made\r\nof calcined bone ashes, and all the base metals, copper, tin, &c., are\r\nabsorbed by the porous material of the cup or carried off by oxydation.\r\nThe gold is then boiled in nitric acid, which dissolves the silver which\r\nit contains, and leaves the gold pure. It is then weighed, and the\r\namount which it has lost gives the exact proportion of impurity in the\r\noriginal bar, and a certificate of the amount of coin due the depositor\r\nis made out accordingly. After being assayed, the bars are melted with a\r\ncertain proportion of silver, and being poured into a dilution of nitric\r\nacid and water, assume a granulated form. In this state the gold is\r\nthoroughly boiled in nitric acid, and rendered perfectly free from\r\nsilver or any other baser metals which may happen to cling to it. It is\r\nnext melted with one-ninth its weight of copper, and, thus alloyed, is\r\nrun into bars, and delivered to the coiner for coinage. The bars are\r\nrolled out in a rolling-mill until nearly as thin as the coin which is\r\nto be made from them. By a process of annealing they are rendered\r\nsufficiently ductile to be drawn through a longitudinal orifice in a\r\npiece of steel, thus reducing the whole to a regular width and\r\nthickness. A cutting-machine next punches small round pieces from the\r\nbar, about the size of the coin. These pieces are weighed separately by\r\nthe “adjusters,” and if too heavy are filed down; if too light they are\r\nmelted again. The pieces which have been adjusted are run through a\r\nmilling-machine, which compresses them to the right diameter and raises\r\nthe edge. Two hundred and fifty are milled in a minute by the machine.\r\nThey are then again softened by the process of annealing, and after a\r\nthorough cleaning are placed in a tube connecting with the stamping\r\ninstrument, and are taken thence one at a time by the machinery, and\r\nstamped between the dies. They are now finished, and, being thrown into\r\na box, are delivered to the treasurer for circulation. The machinery, of\r\ncourse, for all those processes, must be of the nicest kind. When in\r\nfull operation, a mint like that of England, or that of the United\r\nStates at Philadelphia, can coin millions on millions in a year.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           QUICKSILVER MINES.\r\n\r\nQuicksilver, or mercury, is the only metal which remains liquid at\r\nordinary temperatures. It is white and very brilliant, as may be seen in\r\ncommon thermometers. It boils at six hundred and sixty degrees of heat;\r\nand freezes, and assumes a crystalline texture, at forty degrees below\r\nzero. It is extensively used in its various forms in the arts, and also\r\nfor medicinal purposes. The thermometer and barometer illustrate some of\r\nits uses in its pure state; the backs of our common mirrors are covered\r\nwith it, which gives them their reflecting power; it is used extensively\r\nin separating some of the purer metals from the mixtures with which they\r\nare found; and in some of its forms or combinations, it is the basis of\r\ncalomel, corrosive sublimate, vermilion, &c.\r\n\r\nMercury is found in various parts of the world. Among its principal\r\nmines are those of Almaden, near Cordova, in Spain, and of Idria, near\r\nCarniola, in Austria; though it is also found in Peru, California, Italy\r\nand China. Formerly most of the quicksilver came from Germany; but more\r\nrecently the largest production is probably in Spain. So extensively is\r\nit used, that in 1831, over three hundred thousand pounds were brought\r\nfrom the continent into England; and for the fourteen years ending in\r\n1828, the imports of it into Canton, by the English and Americans,\r\naveraged nearly six hundred and fifty thousand pounds a year, worth some\r\nthree hundred and fifty thousand dollars.\r\n\r\nOf all the quicksilver mines, those of Idria, mentioned above, are some\r\nof the most interesting, and demand a particular description, as they\r\nhave been celebrated in natural history, poetry and romance. The ban of\r\nIdria, is a district of Austria, lying west of Carniola. The town, which\r\nis small, is seated in a deep valley, amid high mountains, on the river\r\nof the same name, and at the bottom of so steep a descent, that its\r\napproach is a task of great difficulty, and sometimes of danger.\r\n\r\nThe mines were discovered in 1497, before which time that part of the\r\ncountry was inhabited by a few coopers only, and other artificers in\r\nwood, with which the territory abounds. One evening, a cooper having\r\nplaced a new tub under a dropping spring, to try if it would hold water,\r\non returning the next morning, found it so heavy that he could scarcely\r\nmove it. He at first was led by his superstition to suspect that the tub\r\nwas bewitched; but spying, at length, a shining fluid at the bottom,\r\nwith the nature of which he was unacquainted, he collected it, and\r\nproceeded to an apothecary at Laubach, who, being an artful man,\r\ndismissed him with a small recompense, requesting that he would not fail\r\nto bring him further supplies. From this small beginning, the product of\r\nthese mines has steadily increased; and now might easily be made six\r\nhundred tuns per year, though to uphold the price of the metal, the\r\nAustrian government has restricted the annual production to one hundred\r\nand fifty tuns. In 1803, a disastrous fire took place in these mines,\r\nwhich was extinguished only by drowning all the underground workings.\r\nThe mercury, sublimed by the heat in this catastrophe, occasioned\r\ndiseases and nervous tremblings in more than nine hundred persons in the\r\nneighborhood.\r\n\r\nThe subterraneous passages of the great mine are so extensive, that it\r\nwould require several hours to pass through them. The greatest\r\nperpendicular depth, computing from the entrance of the shaft, is eight\r\nhundred and forty feet; but as these passages advance horizontally,\r\nunder a high mountain, the depth would be much greater if the measure\r\nwere taken from the surface. One mode of descending the shaft is by a\r\nbucket, but as the entrance is narrow, the bucket is liable to strike\r\nagainst the sides, or to be stopped by some obstacle, so that it may be\r\nreadily overset. A second mode of descending, which is safer, is by\r\nmeans of a great number of ladders, placed obliquely, in a kind of\r\nzigzag: as the ladders, however, are wet and narrow, a person must be\r\nvery cautious how he steps, to prevent his falling. In the course of the\r\ndescent, there are several resting-places, which are extremely welcome\r\nto the wearied traveler. In some of the subterraneous passages, the heat\r\nis so intense as to occasion a profuse sweat; and in several of the\r\nshafts the air was formerly so confined, that several miners were\r\nsuffocated by an igneous vapor, or gaseous exhalation, called the\r\nfire-damp. This has been prevented by sinking the main shaft deeper.\r\nNear to it is a large wheel, and a hydraulic machine, by which the mine\r\nis cleared of water.\r\n\r\nTo these pernicious and deadly caverns, criminals are occasionally\r\nbanished by the Austrian government; and it has sometimes happened that\r\nthis punishment has been allotted to persons of considerable rank and\r\nfamily. The case of Count Alberti is an interesting instance of this\r\nkind.\r\n\r\nThe count, having fought a duel with an Austrian general, against the\r\nemperor’s command, and having left him for dead, was obliged to seek\r\nrefuge in one of the forests of Istria, where he was apprehended, and\r\nafterward rescued by a band of robbers who had long infested that\r\nquarter. With these banditti he spent nine months, until, by a close\r\ninvestment of the place in which they were concealed, and after a very\r\nobstinate resistance, in which the greater part of them were killed, he\r\nwas taken and carried to Vienna, to be broken alive on the wheel. This\r\npunishment was, by the intercession of his friends, changed into that of\r\nperpetual confinement and labor in the mines of Idria; a sentence which,\r\nto a noble mind, was worse than death. To these mines he was accompanied\r\nby the countess, his lady, who belonged to one of the first families in\r\nGermany, and who, having tried every means to procure her husband’s\r\npardon without effect, resolved at length to share his miseries, as she\r\ncould not relieve them. They were terminated, however, through the\r\nmediation of the general with whom the duel had been fought, who as soon\r\nas he recovered from his wounds, obtained a pardon for his unfortunate\r\nopponent; and Alberti, on his return to Vienna, was again taken into\r\nfavor, and restored to his fortune and rank.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              IRON MINES.\r\n\r\nThe metal which is called iron, is familiar to all, both for its value\r\nand its various uses. It is capable of being cast in molds of any form;\r\nof being drawn in wires, extended in plates or sheets, of being bent in\r\nevery direction, and of being sharpened, hardened, or softened at\r\npleasure. It accommodates itself to all our wants, desires, and even\r\ncaprices; it is equally serviceable to the arts, the sciences, to\r\nagriculture, and to war; and the same ore furnishes the sword, the\r\nplowshare, the scythe, the pruning-hook, the needle, the graver, the\r\nspring of the watch or that of the carriage, the chisel, the chain, the\r\nanchor, the compass, the cannon, the bomb, the edge of the finest knife\r\nor razor, and the ponderous trip-hammer of enormous weight. It is a\r\nmedicine of much virtue, and the only metal which is always useful, and\r\ntends to no injury to mankind.\r\n\r\nThe ores of iron are scattered over the entire crust of the globe in\r\nbeneficent profusion, and in proportion to the utility of the metal\r\nitself: they are found in every latitude and zone, in every mineral\r\nformation, and in every soil and clime. These ores are nineteen in\r\nnumber, ten of which are worked to profit by the miner, either for the\r\nsake of the iron they contain, for use in their native state, or for\r\nextracting from them some principle or material, useful in manufactures\r\nor the arts.\r\n\r\nNative iron, the existence of which was formerly questioned, has been\r\nfound in several places: it is, however, far from being common, though\r\nit occurs in several mines. A mass of this description of iron was\r\ndiscovered in the district of Santiago del Estero, in South America, by\r\na party of Indians, in the midst of a widely extended plain. It\r\nprojected about a foot above the ground, nearly the whole of its upper\r\nsurface being visible; and the news of its having been found in a\r\ncountry where there are not any mountains, nor even the smallest stone,\r\nwithin the circumference of a hundred leagues, was considered as truly\r\nsurprising. Although the journey was attended with great danger, on\r\naccount of the want of water, and abundance of wild beasts in these\r\ndeserts, several individuals, in the hope of gain, undertook to visit\r\nthis mass; and, having accomplished their journey, sent a specimen of\r\nthe metal to Lima and Madrid, where it was found to be very pure soft\r\niron.\r\n\r\nAs it was reported that this mass was the extremity of an immense vein\r\nof the metal, a metallurgist was sent to examine the spot, and by him it\r\nwas found buried in pure clay and ashes. Externally it had the\r\nappearance of very compact iron, but was internally full of cavities, as\r\nif the whole had been formerly in a liquid state. This idea was\r\nconfirmed by its having, on its surface, the impression of human feet\r\nand hands of a large size, as well as that of the feet of a description\r\nof large birds, very common in South America. Although these impressions\r\nseemed very perfect, it was concluded either that they were =lusus\r\nnaturæ=, or that impressions of this kind were previously on the ground,\r\nand that the liquid mass of iron, in falling on it, received them. It\r\nhad the greatest resemblance to a mass of dough; which, having been\r\nstamped with impressions of hands and feet, and marked with a finger,\r\nhad afterward been converted into iron.\r\n\r\nOn digging round the mass, the under surface was found covered with a\r\ncoat of scoriæ from four to six inches thick, undoubtedly occasioned by\r\nthe moisture of the earth, the upper surface being clean. No appearance\r\nof the formation of iron was observed in the earth, below or round it,\r\nfor a great distance. About two leagues to the eastward was a brackish\r\nmineral spring, and a very gentle ascent of from four to six feet in\r\nhight, running from north to south: with this exception, the adjacent\r\nterritory was a perfect level. About the spring, as well as near the\r\nmass, the earth was very light, loose, and greatly resembling ashes,\r\neven in color. The grass in the vicinity was very short, small, and\r\nextremely unpalatable to the cattle; but that at a distance was long,\r\nand extremely grateful to them. From these concurrent circumstances it\r\nwas concluded, that this mass of native iron, which was estimated to\r\nweigh about three hundred quintals, was produced by a volcanic\r\nexplosion. It is stated as an undoubted fact, that in one of the forests\r\nof the above district of Santiago del Estero, there exists a mass of\r\npure native iron, in the shape of a tree with its branches. At a little\r\ndepth in the earth are found stones of quartz, of a beautiful red color,\r\nwhich the honey-gatherers, the only persons who frequent this rude\r\nterritory, employ as flints to light their fires. Several of these were\r\nselected on account of their peculiar beauty, they being spotted and\r\nstudded, as it were, with gold: one of them, weighing about an ounce,\r\nwas ground by the governor of the district, who extracted from it a dram\r\nof gold.\r\n\r\nA fibrous kind of native iron has been found at Ebenstock, in Saxony,\r\nand also in Siberia, where one particular mass weighed sixteen hundred\r\npounds. It resembled forged iron in its composition, and was malleable\r\nwhen cold, but brittle when red-hot. In Senegal, where it is most\r\ncommon, it is of a cubical form, and is employed by the natives in the\r\nmanufacture of different kinds of vessels. Native meteoric iron, called\r\nalso nickeliferous, from its containing nickel, and native steel iron,\r\nwhich has many of the characters of cast steel, have also been found.\r\n\r\nIron, although one of the imperfect metals, is susceptible of a very\r\nhigh polish, and more capable than any other metal of having its\r\nhardness increased or diminished by certain chemical processes. It is\r\noften manufactured in such a way as to be _one hundred and fifty times_,\r\nand, as will now be seen, in some cases, to be even above _six hundred\r\nand thirty times_ more valuable than gold. On weighing several common\r\nwatch-pendulum springs, such as are sold for ordinary work by the London\r\nartists, at half a crown, ten of them were found to weigh but one single\r\ngrain. Hence one pound avoirdupois, equal to seven thousand grains,\r\ncontains ten times that number of these springs, which amount, at half a\r\ncrown each, to eight thousand, seven hundred and fifty pounds sterling.\r\nReckoning the troy ounce of gold at four pounds sterling, and the pound\r\nequal to fifty-seven hundred and sixty grains, at forty-eight pounds\r\nsterling, the value of an avoirdupois pound of gold is over fifty-eight\r\npounds sterling. The above amount of the value of the watch-springs\r\nweighing an avoirdupois pound, being divided by that sum, will give a\r\nratio of somewhat more than one hundred and fifty to one. But the\r\npendulum-springs of the best kind of watches sell at half a guinea each;\r\nand at this price the above-mentioned value is increased in the ratio of\r\nfour and one-fifth to one; which gives an amount of thirty-six thousand,\r\nseven hundred and fifty pounds sterling. This sum being divided by the\r\nvalue of the avoirdupois pound of gold, gives a quotient of more than\r\nsix hundred and thirty to one.\r\n\r\nIt is one of the valuable properties of iron, after it is reduced into\r\nthe state of steel, that, although it is sufficiently soft when hot, or\r\nwhen gradually cooled, to be formed without difficulty into various\r\ntools and utensils, still it may be afterward rendered more or less\r\nhard, even to an extreme degree, by simply plunging it, when red-hot,\r\ninto cold water. This is called tempering, the hardness produced being\r\ngreater in proportion as the steel is hotter and the water cooler. Hence\r\narises the superiority of this metal for making mechanics’ instruments\r\nor tools, by which all other metals, and even itself, are filed, drilled\r\nand cut. The various degrees of hardness given to iron, depend on the\r\nquantity of ignition it possesses at the moment of being tempered, which\r\nis manifested by the succession of color exhibited on the surface of the\r\nmetal, in the progress of its receiving the increasing heat. These are,\r\nthe yellowish white, yellow, gold-color, purple, violet, and deep blue;\r\nafter the exhibition of which the complete ignition takes place. These\r\ncolors proceed from a kind of scorification on the surface of the heated\r\nmetal.\r\n\r\nThe largest iron-works in England are carried on in Colebrookdale, in\r\nShropshire. This spot, which is situated between two towering and\r\nvariegated hills, covered with wood, possesses peculiar advantages, the\r\nore being obtained from the adjacent hills, the coals from the vale, and\r\nabundance of limestone from the quarries in the vicinity. The romantic\r\nscenery which nature here exhibits, and the works which are carried on,\r\nseem to realize the ancient fable of the Cyclops. The noise of the\r\nforges, mills, &c., with all their vast machinery, the flames bursting\r\nfrom the furnaces, with the burning coal, and the smoke of the\r\nlime-kilns, are altogether horribly sublime. To complete the\r\npeculiarities of the spot, a bridge, entirely constructed of iron, is\r\nhere thrown over the Severn. In one place it has parted, and a chasm is\r\nformed; but such is its firm basis, that the fissure has neither injured\r\nits strength nor utility.\r\n\r\nThe great superiority of Swedish iron over that of all other countries,\r\nfor the manufacture of steel, is well known, and is ascribed to the\r\ngreat purity of the ore from which the iron is smelted. The British\r\nsteel-makers have found it difficult to employ British iron in their\r\nprocesses, it being too brittle to bear cementation; but attempts have\r\nbeen made at Sheffield, with some success. Wootz, a species of steel\r\nfrom India, has been successfully used for nicer kinds of cutlery. One\r\nof the most remarkable of the Swedish mines, if the name can with\r\npropriety be applied to it, is Tabern, a mountain of a considerable\r\nsize, composed entirely of pure iron ore, and occurring in a large tract\r\nof sand, over which it seems to have been deposited. This mountain has\r\nbeen wrought for nearly three centuries, notwithstanding which its size\r\nis scarcely diminished.\r\n\r\nBut the richest iron mine of Sweden is that of Danmora, in the province\r\nof Upland. It is in depth eighty fathoms; occupies a considerable extent\r\nof territory; and its ore is conveyed to the surface of the earth,\r\nthrough several pits or openings made for that purpose, by means of\r\ncasks fixed to large cables, which are put in motion by horses. The\r\nworkmen standing on the edges of these casks, and having their arms\r\nclasped round the cable, descend and ascend with the utmost composure.\r\nThe water is drawn from the bottom by a wheel sixty-six feet in\r\ndiameter, and is afterward conveyed along an aqueduct nearly a mile and\r\na half in length. At certain distances from Danmora, are several\r\nfurnaces, with large and populous villages exclusively inhabited by the\r\nminers.\r\n\r\nIn Wraxall’s tour through the north of Europe, the mine of Danmora is\r\ndescribed as yielding the finest iron ore in Europe, its produce being\r\nexported to every country, and constituting one of the most important\r\nsources of national wealth and royal revenue. The ore is not dug, as is\r\nusual in other mines, but is torn up by the force of gunpowder, an\r\noperation which is performed every day at noon, and is one of the most\r\nawful and tremendous that can possibly be conceived. “We arrived,”\r\nobserves the tourist, “at the mouth of the great mine, which is nearly\r\nhalf an English mile in circumference, in time to be present at it. Soon\r\nafter twelve the first explosion took place, and could not be so aptly\r\ncompared to anything as to subterraneous thunder, or rather volleys of\r\nartillery discharged under ground. The stones were thrown up, by the\r\nviolence of the gunpowder, to a vast hight above the surface of the\r\nground, and the concussion was so great as to shake the surrounding\r\nearth or rock on every side.\r\n\r\n“As soon as the explosion had ceased, I determined to descend into the\r\nmine, to effect which I had to seat myself in a large, deep bucket,\r\ncapable of containing three persons, and fastened by chains to a rope.\r\nWhen I found myself thus suspended between heaven and earth by a rope,\r\nand looked down into the dark and deep abyss beneath me, to which I\r\ncould see no termination, I shuddered with apprehension, and half\r\nrepented my curiosity. This was, however, only a momentary sensation,\r\nand before I had descended a hundred feet, I looked round on the scene\r\nwith very tolerable composure. It was nearly nine minutes before I\r\nreached the bottom; and when I set my foot on the earth, the view of the\r\nmine was awful and sublime in the highest degree. Whether, as I surveyed\r\nit, terror or pleasure formed the predominant feeling, is hard to say.\r\nThe light of the day was very faintly admitted into these subterraneous\r\ncaverns: in many places it was absolutely lost, and flambeaux were\r\nkindled in its stead. Beams of wood were laid across some parts, from\r\none side of the rock to the other; and on these the miners sat, employed\r\nin boring holes for the admission of gunpowder, with the most perfect\r\nunconcern, although the least dizziness, or even a failure in preserving\r\ntheir equilibrium, must have made them lose their seat, and have dashed\r\nthem against the rugged surface of the rock beneath. The fragments torn\r\nup by the explosion, previously to my descent, lay in vast heaps on all\r\nsides, and the whole scene was calculated to inspire a gloomy\r\nadmiration.\r\n\r\n“I remained three-quarters of an hour in these frightful and gloomy\r\ncaverns, which find employment for not less than thirteen hundred\r\nworkmen, and traversed every part of them which was accessible,\r\nconducted by my guides. The weather above was very warm, but here the\r\nice covered the whole surface of the ground, and I found myself\r\nsurrounded with the colds of the most rigorous winter, amid darkness and\r\ncaves of iron. In one of these, which ran a considerable way beneath the\r\nrock, were eight wretched beings warming themselves round a charcoal\r\nfire, and eating the little scanty subsistence arising from their\r\nmiserable occupation. They rose with surprise at seeing so unexpected a\r\nguest among them, and I was not a little pleased to dry my feet, which\r\nwere wet with treading on the melted ice, at their fire.\r\n\r\n“Having gratified my curiosity with a view of these subterraneous\r\napartments, I made the signal for being drawn up, and felt so little\r\nterror while reascending, compared with that of being let down, that I\r\nam convinced, after five or six repetitions, I should have been\r\nperfectly indifferent to the undertaking. So strong is the effect of\r\ncustom on the human mind, and so contemptible does danger or horror\r\nbecome when familiarized by repeated trials!”\r\n\r\nThroughout the whole extent of Sweden, the iron mines at present\r\nwrought, employ thousands of persons, and yield annually upward of one\r\nhundred thousand tuns of metal. There are said to be between five and\r\nsix hundred mines in the entire country, nearly half of which are\r\nsituated in the central provinces: this, however, includes mines of all\r\ndescriptions, though by far the most are of iron. The products of all\r\nthese mines would be vastly greater than they are, were it not for the\r\nmultiplied and unreasonable restrictions of the government.\r\n\r\nThe iron trade of the United States, and the domestic manufacture of\r\niron, were spoken of by Mr. Gallatin, in a report to Congress, in 1810,\r\nas being firmly established. He was able to obtain very imperfect\r\ninformation about it, but it was known that iron ore was plentiful; that\r\nnumerous forges and furnaces had been erected, supplying “a sufficient\r\nquantity of hollow-ware, and of castings of every description.” From\r\nRussia, about forty-five hundred tuns of bar iron were imported yearly,\r\nand perhaps another forty-five hundred from Sweden and England. A vague\r\nestimate gave fifty thousand tuns of bar iron as the annual consumption\r\nof the union, of which he considered forty thousand as the product of\r\nthe republic. Some good iron was made in Virginia and Pennsylvania, but\r\nmuch inferior iron, carelessly manufactured, was brought into market. Of\r\nsheet, slit, and hoop iron, about five hundred and sixty-five tuns were\r\nannually imported; about seven thousand tuns were rolled and slit in the\r\nUnited States. Massachusetts had thirteen rolling and slitting mills,\r\nand the value of cut nails and brads made within the republic in a year,\r\nwas estimated at twelve hundred thousand dollars. Nearly three hundred\r\ntuns of cut nails were exported. Agricultural implements were made at\r\nhome, and much coarse ironmongery; but cutlery, fine hardware, and steel\r\nwork, were brought from Britain. About forty thousand muskets were\r\nyearly made in New England and at Harper’s Ferry: also balls, shells,\r\nand brass and iron cannon, in various places. There were several iron\r\nfounderies for machinery castings, and steam-engines had begun to be\r\nmade at Philadelphia. Mr. Gallatin valued the iron and manufactures of\r\niron then annually made at home, at from twelve to fifteen millions of\r\ndollars, and the imports at near four millions, as prices went.\r\n\r\nAdam Seybert enumerates the domestic products of 1810, at 53,908 tuns of\r\npig iron, from 153 furnaces; 24,541 tuns of bar iron from 330 forges;\r\n15,727,914 pounds of nails (partly out of imported iron) from 410\r\nnaileries; and 6,500 tuns of iron were required at 316 trip-hammers and\r\nthirty-four rolling and slitting mills. His estimate of the value of the\r\nhome manufacture is $14,364,526. In 1806 or 1807, Chancellor Livingston,\r\nthen our minister to France, had to apply repeatedly to the British\r\nministry for permission to buy in England, and export to New York, the\r\nsteam-engine which Fulton put on board his first steamboat on the\r\nHudson. Now, the manufacture of steam-engines is an important branch of\r\nour home industry.\r\n\r\nIn 1827-8, it was given in evidence before a committee of Congress, that\r\nPennsylvania had made, during the past year, 21,800 tuns of bar iron,\r\nand 47,075 tuns of cast iron; that 3,000 tuns of bar iron were made near\r\nLake Champlain; that three counties in New Jersey had made 2,050 tuns,\r\nand that in a circle of thirty miles’ diameter, in New York, there were\r\none hundred and ten forge fires, each of them able to produce\r\ntwenty-five to thirty-five tuns yearly. In 1830, a committee of Congress\r\nreported on the iron trade, and from their report and other later\r\nsources, we learn that that year 112,866 tuns of bar, and 191,537 of pig\r\niron, worth $13,327,760, employing 29,254 men, who received $8,776,420\r\nin wages, were made. Perhaps the quantity and number of workmen are\r\noverstated. In 1840, with improved machinery, only 30,497 men produced\r\n484,136 tuns.\r\n\r\nWithout coal and iron, the United States and Britain never could have\r\nrisen to the rank of first-rate powers. In fact, without iron,\r\ncivilization must have made very slow progress, as must be evident to\r\nany one who will take the trouble to try seriously to enumerate the\r\nvarious articles _essential_ to society, of which iron is an\r\nindispensable part.\r\n\r\nIn 1839-40, according to the official returns, which are imperfect, the\r\nUnited States produced, with 804 furnaces, 286,903 tuns of cast iron,\r\nand with 795 blomaries, forges and rolling-mills, 187,233 tuns of bar\r\niron. The capital invested was nearly twenty and a half millions of\r\ndollars; the men employed, miners included, were 30,497, and 1,528,110\r\ntuns of fuel were employed in these operations. The value of iron and\r\nsteel, and their manufactures, imported in 1839-40, as per official\r\nreturns, was $7,241,407. The estimated value of the iron made in the\r\nUnited States that year, was $22,778,635; of which sum $15,585,730 were\r\nfor labor, including mining, transportation, coaling, hauling, &c. The\r\npersons employed in the iron manufacture, and their families, were\r\nestimated at 213,505, which, at twelve and a half cents each, per day,\r\nfor agricultural products consumed, would give $9,741,166.\r\n\r\nIn 1845, the product of the union was estimated thus: 540 blast\r\nfurnaces, yielding 486,000 tuns of pig iron; 954 blomaries, forges,\r\nrolling-mills, &c. yielding 291,600 tuns of bar, hoop, sheet, boiler,\r\nand other wrought iron, 30,000 tuns of blooms and 121,500 tuns of\r\ncastings; value of the whole nearly forty-two millions of dollars.\r\n\r\nThe United States imported of iron, chiefly bar and bolt, rolled,\r\nhammered, or otherwise manufactured, and pig, hoop and sheet, in 1838-9,\r\n115,637 tuns; in 1839-40, 72,769; 1840-1, 112,111; in 1841-2, 107,392;\r\nin 1842-3, 38,405.\r\n\r\nIn 1846-7, we find by the treasury report, that the United States\r\nexported of domestic manufactures, 3,197,135 pounds of nails, worth\r\n$168,817, of which Cuba took 2,317,550 pounds; also other articles of\r\niron and steel to the value of $998,667, of which $478,681 to Cuba, and\r\n$162,020 to British North America. In that year, among the imports,\r\nchiefly from England, were 549 tuns of steel, value $1,126,458; 55,599\r\ntuns of bar iron; 28,083 tuns of pig; 1,893 tuns of scraps; 6,167,720\r\npounds of chain cables; 13,410,556 pounds of sheet and hoop; 1,412,332\r\npounds of anvils; 921,845 pounds of nails; 361,423 pounds of anchors;\r\n975,256 pounds of castings; 170,909 pounds of cast-iron butts; 431,916\r\npounds of band; 660,133 pounds of round or square; 347,737 pounds of\r\nnail or spike rods.\r\n\r\nOfficial tables show that the imports of manufactures of steel and iron\r\nin 1839, were worth $6,507,510; in 1843, $1,012,086; in 1844,\r\n$3,313,796; in 1845, $5,077,788; and that in 1839, the value of pig and\r\nbar iron and steel imported was $6,302,539; in 1842 and 1845, nearly\r\nfour millions each year; in 1843, $1,091,598; and in 1844, $2,380,027.\r\n\r\nSome idea of the extent of the iron trade inland may be formed from the\r\nquantities carried on the canals. In 1847, there came to the Hudson on\r\nthe New York canals, pig iron, 21,608,000 pounds; bloom and bar\r\n26,348,000 pounds; iron ware, 3,014,000 pounds: 340 tuns of iron and\r\niron ware were cleared on the canals at Buffalo and Oswego; St. Lawrence\r\ncounty, N. Y., shipped 515 tuns of pig, a surplus made there; 7,716 tuns\r\nof pig iron reached Buffalo _via_ Lake Erie, and 1,256 kegs of nails;\r\n15,103,565 pounds of iron and nails arrived at Cleveland _via_ the Ohio\r\ncanal, and 4,085 tuns of iron and 12,537 kegs of nails were shipped from\r\nCleveland coastwise. There were cleared at Portsmouth, Chilicothe,\r\nMassillon, and Akron, in 1847, about 5,713 tuns of iron; 5,269,055\r\npounds of nails were shipped at Akron. The trade in coal and iron on the\r\nwestern rivers and lakes is very large.\r\n\r\nIron canal-boats were in common use in Wales thirty years ago: they are\r\nbeginning to be made here; also war-steamers. Fences, and even porches\r\nto houses, are often of iron. The pipes for the Croton water in New York\r\nrequired many thousand tuns. The annual value of 150,000 tuns of iron\r\nore of Maryland is worth $600,000 at Baltimore. A single foundery in\r\nTennessee sold, in 1844, of sugar-kettles, $50,000 worth.\r\n\r\nChild’s statistics show that in Pennsylvania, in 1847, there were made,\r\nat 213 furnaces, 98,395 tuns of cast iron, and at 169 blomaries, forges,\r\n&c., 87,244 tuns of bar iron, 11,522 men being employed, including\r\nlimestone miners, and a capital of $7,751,470 invested. In 1846, there\r\nwere 173,369 tuns manufactured, seven of the furnaces using anthracite\r\ncoal. Forty furnaces, in 1847, were in blast, using anthracite, and\r\nproducing 121,800 tuns of iron, at a reduced price, which price had\r\ninduced capitalists to put up extensive rolling-mills. The American\r\nQuarterly Register has a list of nineteen anthracite rolling-mills in\r\nPennsylvania, which make iron rails and plate, bar and rod, nails, axle\r\nand small iron.\r\n\r\nThe first bar of railroad iron ever manufactured in the United States,\r\nwas made in 1841, and now it is said, one hundred thousand tuns could be\r\nmade easily; while the annual product of iron from all the furnaces,\r\nwhich are said to be some three hundred in number, is estimated at over\r\nfour hundred thousand tuns.\r\n\r\nThe yearly manufacture of iron in Great Britain, is now estimated at\r\nnearly three millions of tuns. In 1828, there were in Russia, nineteen\r\nfounderies, forges and mines, and in 1804, that country exported to\r\nAmerica over nine million pounds of iron. In 1819, France produced\r\nseventy-four million pounds of iron, and in 1845, this had increased to\r\nthree hundred and forty-two millions, or over one hundred and fifty\r\nthousand tuns. Of iron and steel, and the various manufactures from\r\nthem, Great Britain exported in 1845, to the extent of thirty-three\r\nmillions.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             COPPER MINES.\r\n\r\nCopper (from =cuprum=, a corruption of =cuprium=, from the island of\r\nCyprus, whence it was formerly brought) was known at a very remote\r\nperiod; and in the early ages of the world, before iron was extensively\r\nin use, was the chief ingredient in domestic utensils and instruments of\r\nwar. It is abundant; and is found both native and in many ores, the most\r\nimportant of which are the varieties of _pyrites_, which are sulphurets\r\nof copper and iron. The genus copper includes some thirteen species, and\r\neach of these contains several varieties.\r\n\r\nThe purest copper obtained in Europe, is the produce of the mines of the\r\nSwedish province of Dalecarlia. The following is a brief description of\r\nthe principal of these immense and gloomy caverns, all of which boast a\r\nhigh antiquity.\r\n\r\nThe traveler’s curiosity is first attracted by the hydraulic machines\r\nwhich convey the water to the different quarters, and the power of which\r\nis such, that one of the wheels has a diameter of not less than\r\nforty-four feet. Another wheel, of proportionate magnitude, is employed\r\nto raise the ore from the mine to the surface of the earth, and is\r\nadmirably constructed. Regular circles are placed on each side, and\r\nround these the chain rises, taking a larger or smaller circumference,\r\nin proportion to the necessary circle to be made, so as to\r\ncounterbalance the weight, and consequently the increased motion of the\r\nbucket.\r\n\r\nExteriorly, a vast chasm of a tremendous depth presents itself to the\r\nview. This being the part of the mine which was first opened, either\r\nthrough the ignorance or neglect of those who had then the management of\r\nthe works, the excavations so weakened the foundations of the hill, that\r\nthe whole fell in, leaving a most chaotic scene of precipitated rocks,\r\nand a gaping gulf resembling the mouth of a volcano. Great care has been\r\nsince taken that no such disaster should again occur. Plans and sections\r\nare drawn of all the galleries, &c.; and where the prosecution of the\r\nworks in the same direction might be dangerous, orders are issued for\r\nthe miners to stop, and an iron crown is fixed on the spot, as a\r\nprohibition ever to proceed further. The workmen then explore in a\r\ndifferent direction, while every subterraneous excavation is nicely\r\nwatched.\r\n\r\nThe traveler passes into the great chasm by a range of wooden steps,\r\nwhich cross, in a variety of directions, the rough masses of fallen\r\nrocks, of gravel, and of the ancient machinery. Ere he reaches the\r\nentrance of the cavern, he has to descend nearly two hundred feet, and\r\nthis being accomplished, proceeds horizontally to a considerable\r\ndistance within. He now loses the pure air of day, and gradually\r\nbreathes an oppressive vapor, which rolls toward him, in volumes, from\r\nthe mouths of a hundred caves leading into the main passage. He now\r\nfeels as if he were inhaling the atmosphere of Tartarus. The Swedish\r\niron mines which have been described, are mere purgatories when compared\r\nwith this satanic dwelling. The descent is performed entirely by steps\r\nlaid in the winding rock; and, in following the subterraneous declivity,\r\nthe traveler reaches the tremendous depths of these truly Stygian\r\ndominions.\r\n\r\nThe pestilential vapors which environ him with increasing clouds, and\r\nthe style of the entrance, remind him of Virgil’s description of the\r\ndescent of Eneas to the infernal regions. Here are to be seen the same\r\ncaverned portico, the rocky, rough descent, and the steaming sulphur,\r\nwith all the deadly stenches of Avernus. The wretched inmates of this\r\ngloomy cavern, appear to him like so many specters, as poetic fiction\r\nhas described them: and he is induced by the length of the way, joined\r\nto the excessive heat and its suffocating quality, to fancy that he will\r\nbe made to pay dearly for his curiosity. In one part the steam is so\r\nexcessively hot, as to scorch at the distance of twelve paces, at the\r\nsame time that the sulphureous smell is intolerable. Near this spot a\r\nvolcanic fire broke out some years ago, in consequence of which strong\r\nwalls were constructed, as barriers to its power, and several contiguous\r\npassages, which, had it spread, would have proved dangerous to the mine,\r\nclosed up.\r\n\r\nThe visitor has now to traverse many long and winding galleries, as well\r\nas large vaulted caverns, where the workmen are dispersed on all sides,\r\nemployed in hewing vast masses of the rock, and preparing other parts\r\nfor explosion. Others wheel the brazen ore toward the black abyss, where\r\nthe suspended buckets hang ready to draw it upward. From the effect of\r\nsuch violent exercise, combined with the heat, they are obliged to work\r\nalmost naked. Their groups, occupations, and primitive appearance,\r\nscantily lighted by the trembling rays of torches, form a curious and\r\ninteresting scene.\r\n\r\nThe depth of the mine being at least twelve hundred feet, a full hour is\r\nrequired to reach to the bottom. The mass of copper lies in the form of\r\nan inverted cone. Five hundred men are employed daily; but females are\r\nnot admitted, on account of the deleterious quality of the vapors. This\r\nmine was anciently a state prison, in which criminals, slaves and\r\nprisoners of war toiled out their wretched existence. Near the bottom is\r\na rocky saloon, furnished with benches. It is called the Hall of the\r\nSenate, on account of its having been the resting-place of several\r\nSwedish kings, who came, attended by the senators, to examine the works,\r\nand here took refreshments. It was in this mine that the immortal\r\nGustavus Vasa, disguised as a peasant, labored for his bread, during a\r\nlong concealment, after having been robbed by his guide; and his first\r\nadherents in the struggle which placed him on the throne, were from the\r\nminers and peasants of Dalecarlia.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1751, a very rich copper mine was wrought in the county of\r\nWicklow, Ireland. From this mine ran a stream of blue-colored water, of\r\nso deleterious a nature as to destroy all the fish in the river Arklow,\r\ninto which it flowed. One of the workmen, having left an iron shovel in\r\nthis stream, found it some days after incrusted with copper. This led\r\none of the proprietors of the mine to institute a set of experiments,\r\nfrom which he concluded that the blue water contained an acid holding\r\ncopper in solution; that iron had a stronger affinity for the acid than\r\ncopper; and that the consequence of this affinity was the precipitation\r\nof the copper, and the solution of the iron, when pieces of that metal\r\nwere thrown into the blue water. These ideas induced the miners to dig\r\nseveral pits for the reception of this water, and to put bars of iron\r\ninto them. The result was, that they obtained an abundance of copper,\r\nmuch purer and more valuable than that which they had procured from the\r\nore itself by smelting.\r\n\r\nOn the island of Anglesea, near Dulas bay, on the north coast, is Parys\r\nmountain, which contains the most considerable quantity of copper ore\r\nperhaps ever known. The external aspect of the hill is extremely rude,\r\nand it is surrounded by enormous rocks of coarse white quartz. The ore\r\nis lodged in a basin, or hollow, and has on one side a small lake, over\r\nthe waves of which, as over those of Avernus, fatal to the feathered\r\ntribe, it is said that birds are never known to pass. The effect of the\r\nmineral operations has been, that the whole of this tract has assumed a\r\nwild and savage appearance. Suffocating fumes of the burning heaps of\r\ncopper arise in all parts, and extend their baneful influence for miles\r\naround. That the ore was worked in a very remote period, appears by\r\nvestiges of the ancient operations, which were carried on by trenching,\r\nand by heating the rocks intensely, when water was suddenly poured on\r\nthem, so as to cause them to crack or scale. In the year 1768, after a\r\nlong search, which was so little profitable that it was on the eve of\r\nbeing abandoned, a large body of copper ore was found; and this has ever\r\nsince been worked to great advantage, still promising a vast supply. The\r\nwater lodged in the bottom of the bed of ore, being strongly impregnated\r\nwith the metal, is drawn up and distributed in pits, where the same\r\nprocess is employed as in the Wicklow mine. The copper thus procured\r\ndiffers little from native copper, and is very highly prized.\r\n\r\nIn the Parys mine, eight tuns of gunpowder are annually expended in\r\nblasting the rock. Nature has here been profuse in bestowing her mineral\r\nfavors; for, above the copper ore, and not more than two feet beneath\r\nthe soil, is a bed of yellowish greasy clay, from three to twelve feet\r\nin thickness, containing lead ore, from a tun of which metal, upward of\r\nfifty ounces of silver are generally obtained.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COPPER MINE IN CORNWALL.]\r\n\r\nThe copper mines of Cornwall, a view of one of which is given in the\r\ncut, are very numerous, and several of them large and very rich in ore.\r\nIt is remarkable that in various parts of this country the earth has\r\nproduced such an exuberance of this metal, as to afford it in large\r\nmassy lumps of malleable copper, several pieces of which are shown in\r\nvery curious vegetable forms. The particular ore named _mundic_, found\r\nin the tin mines, was for many ages considered of no other use but to\r\nnourish that metal while in the mine. In the reign of Queen Elizabeth, a\r\nlaudable curiosity tempted several private individuals to examine into\r\nits nature; but the design miscarried, and the mundic was thrown, as\r\nuseless, into the old pits in which the rubbish was collected. However,\r\nabout a century ago, this purpose was effected by degrees; and the\r\ncopper extracted from the ore now produces, on an average, upward of\r\ntwelve thousand tuns, valued at between four and five millions of\r\ndollars, annually, equaling in goodness the best Swedish copper, while\r\nthe ore itself yields a proportionate quantity of =lapis calaminaris=,\r\nfor the making of brass.\r\n\r\nAt Ecton hill, near the river Dove, in Derbyshire, a valuable copper\r\nmine was discovered some years ago, and has since been worked to great\r\nadvantage. In its position, situation and inclination, it differs from\r\nany mine yet discovered in Europe, Asia, Africa or America; the\r\nwonderful mass of copper ore not running in regular veins or courses,\r\nbut sinking perpendicularly down, widening and swelling out at the\r\nbottom in the form of a bell. The works are four hundred and fifty feet\r\nbeneath the river Dove, it being the deepest mine in Great Britain. On\r\nthe opposite side of Ecton hill is a valuable lead mine, the veins of\r\nwhich approach very nearly to the copper mine.\r\n\r\nCopper is converted into brass by the agency of calamine, an oxyd of\r\nzinc. It occurs frequently in beds, and in some places exists in great\r\nabundance. The Mendip hills, in Somersetshire, were once celebrated for\r\ntheir mines of calamine, which are now in a great measure exhausted. It\r\nis dug out of the earth, and being broken into small pieces, is exposed\r\nto the action of a current of water, which washes away the light earthy\r\nmatter, and leaves the calamine. The whole is then thrown into deep\r\nwooden vessels filled with water, and agitated for a considerable time.\r\nThe galena sinks to the bottom, the calamine is deposited in the center,\r\nand the earthy matter lies on the surface. The calamine, thus separated\r\nfrom its impurities, is ground to powder, and becomes fit for use.\r\n\r\nHungary abounds in valuable ores and minerals, and is most celebrated\r\nfor its vast copper works, at a town called Herrengrund, built on the\r\nsummit of a mountain, and exclusively inhabited by miners. Here the\r\nprocess, noticed above, of apparently converting iron into copper, is\r\npursued with great success, several hundred weight of iron being thus\r\ntransmuted every year. The vitriol, with which the blue water is\r\nstrongly impregnated, can not be strictly said to convert the iron into\r\ncopper, but insinuates into it the copper particles with which it is\r\nsaturated; and this seeming transmutation requires a fortnight or three\r\nweeks only: but if the iron be suffered to lie too long in this\r\nvitriolic solution, it becomes at length reduced to powder.\r\n\r\nIn Japan, copper is the most common of all the metals, and is considered\r\nas the finest and most malleable anywhere to be found. Much of this\r\ncopper is not only of the purest quality, but is blended with a\r\nconsiderable proportion of gold, which the Japanese separate and refine.\r\nThe whole is brought to Saccin, one of the five principal cities of\r\nJapan; and it is there purified, and cast into small cylinders, about a\r\nspan and a half in length, and a finger’s breadth in thickness. Brass is\r\nthere very scarce, and much dearer than copper, the calamine employed in\r\nmaking it being imported from Tonquin in flat cakes, and sold at a very\r\nhigh price.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the copper mines thus described, copper has, within a few\r\nyears, been found in the richest abundance in the vicinity of Lake\r\nSuperior. The existence of copper there, was, indeed, known as early as\r\n1636; and the trace of these early discoveries was never entirely lost.\r\nBut the first scientific researches were made in 1842, by Dr. Douglas\r\nHoughton, who was acting as geological surveyor for the state of\r\nMichigan. According to his report, native copper exists in two or three\r\ndifferent deposits about Lake Superior, where it is found in the richest\r\nabundance, both in veins and in large masses in the native state. Dr.\r\nJackson also states, that he has seen one of these masses, twenty feet\r\nlong, nine feet wide, and from four to six inches in thickness, and\r\nweighing about twenty tuns. He adds, that in a single year, thirty-three\r\nmen, of whom only twenty were properly miners, had taken out forty-three\r\ntuns of ore, yielding thirty tuns of pure copper. Among the masses of\r\ncopper obtained from these mines as early as 1848, were four, the\r\nweights of which, respectively, were seven thousand and eighteen, seven\r\nthousand four hundred and eighty-four, seven thousand six hundred and\r\nseventy-eight, and fourteen thousand pounds. Since that date new\r\nopenings have been made; new mining companies formed, and the products\r\nof the mines very greatly increased: and it may yet be, that these mines\r\nwill prove some of the richest and most valuable of the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               TIN MINES.\r\n\r\nTin, in its pure state, has nearly the color and luster of silver. In\r\nhardness, it is midway between gold and lead. It was known to the\r\nancients, who procured it from Spain and Britain, and appears to have\r\nbeen in use in the time of Moses. It is rather a scarce metal, being\r\nfound in but few parts of the world in any considerable quantity.\r\nCornwall is its most productive source; it also occurs in the mountains\r\nbetween Gallicia and Portugal, and in those between Saxony and Bohemia.\r\nIt has, also, been brought from Malacca, in India, and from Chili and\r\nMexico. There are but two ores of tin; one of which, the native peroxyd,\r\nis the chief source of all the supplies of this metal, as the other ore,\r\nwhich is the double sulphuret of tin and copper, sometimes called\r\n_bell-metal ore_, is extremely rare.\r\n\r\nCornwall has been in all ages, famous for its numerous mines of tin,\r\nwhich are in general very large, and rich in ore. The tin-works are of\r\ndifferent kinds, dependent on the various forms in which the metal\r\nappears. In many places its ore so nearly resembles common stones, that\r\nit can only be distinguished from them by its superior weight. In other\r\nparts, the ore is a compound of tin and earth, concreted into a\r\nsubstance almost as hard as stone, of a bluish or grayish color, and to\r\nwhich the mundic, impregnated with copper, frequently gives a yellowish\r\ncast. This ore is always found in a continued stratum, which the miners\r\ncall lode; and this, for the greater part, is found running through the\r\nsolid substance of the hardest rocks, beginning in small veins near the\r\nsurface, perhaps not above half an inch or an inch wide, and increasing,\r\nas they proceed, into large dimensions, branching out into several\r\nramifications, and bending downward in a direction which is, generally,\r\nnearly east and west. These lodes, or veins, are sometimes white, very\r\nwide, and so thick, that large lumps of the ore are frequently drawn up\r\nof more than twenty pounds’ weight. The lodes of tin ore are not always\r\ncontiguous, but sometimes break off so entirely, that they seem to\r\nterminate; but the sagacious miner knows by experience, that, by digging\r\nat a small distance on one side, he will meet with a separated part of\r\nthe lode, apparently tallying with the other end, as nicely as if it had\r\nbeen broken off by some sudden shock of the rock.\r\n\r\nThe miners of Cornwall follow the lode, or vein, in all its rich and\r\nmeandering curves through the bowels of the flinty earth. The waters are\r\nsometimes drained from the mines, by subterraneous passages, formed from\r\nthe body of the mountain to the level country. These passages are called\r\n_adits_, and are occasionally the labor of many years; but when\r\neffected, they save the constant expense of large water-works and\r\nfire-engines. From the surface of the earth the workmen sink a passage\r\nto the mine, which they call a shaft, and place over it a large winch,\r\nor, in works of greater magnitude, a wheel and axle, by which means they\r\ndraw up large quantities of ore at a time, in vessels called _kibbuls_.\r\nThis ore is thrown into heaps, which great numbers of poor people are\r\nemployed in breaking to pieces, and fitting the ore for the\r\nstamping-mills.\r\n\r\nA third form in which tin appears is that of crystals; for this metal\r\nwill, under proper circumstances, readily crystallize. Hence, in many\r\nparts of the mineral rocks, are found the most perfectly transparent and\r\nbeautiful crystals of pure tin. Beside these crystals, in many of the\r\ncavernous parts of the rocks, are found those transparent crystals,\r\ncalled Cornish diamonds, they being extremely brilliant when well\r\npolished. The form is that of a six-sided prism pointed on the top, and\r\nthey are sometimes four or five inches in length. The value of the tin\r\nexported from Great Britain, in 1853, the greater part of which came\r\nfrom the Cornwall mines, was nearly six million dollars.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              LEAD MINES.\r\n\r\nLead is one of the metals most anciently known, being mentioned in the\r\nbooks of Moses. It is found in some thirteen species of ore, only one of\r\nwhich (_galena_) occurs in masses sufficiently large to make it valuable\r\nas an object of mining and metallurgy. The uses of lead are so familiar\r\nthat they need not be mentioned: they are known to all.\r\n\r\nAmong the most remarkable lead mines of the world, may be mentioned\r\nthose of the state of Illinois, including also parts of Iowa and\r\nWisconsin, which have been, and still are immensely productive,\r\nextending over thousands of acres, and furnishing the mineral in the\r\nrichest abundance. These mines were formerly known as the mines of\r\n“Upper Louisiana.” They are now chiefly worked in the vicinity of\r\nGalena, a city which has sprung up, and is almost entirely supported by\r\nthe trade in lead. So vast is the production of these mines, that forty\r\nmillion pounds of lead, valued at sixteen hundred thousand dollars, were\r\nshipped from Galena alone, in 1853. The mineral in one of the earliest\r\nopened mines, is said to be of two kinds, the gravel and fossil. The\r\ngravel mineral is found immediately under the soil, intermixed with\r\ngravel, in pieces of solid mineral weighing from one to fifty pounds.\r\nBeneath the gravel is a sand rock, which being broken, crumbles to a\r\nfine sand, and contains mineral nearly of the same quality as that of\r\nthe gravel. But the mineral of the first quality is found in a bed of\r\nred clay, under the sand rock, in pieces of from ten to five hundred\r\npounds’ weight, on the outside of which is a spar, or fossil, of a\r\nbright, glittering appearance, resembling spangles of gold and silver,\r\nas solid as the mineral itself, and of a greater specific gravity. This\r\nbeing taken off, the mineral is solid, unconnected with any other\r\nsubstance, of a broad grain, and what mineralogists call potters’ ore.\r\nIn other mines, in the vicinity of the above, the lead is found in\r\nregular veins, from two to four feet in thickness, containing about\r\nfifty ounces of silver in a tun.\r\n\r\nIn Great Britain, there are numerous and exceedingly valuable lead\r\nmines, among which may be cited that of Arkingdale, in Yorkshire, and\r\nthose with which Shropshire abounds. In the south of Lanarkshire, and in\r\nthe vicinity of Wanlock-head, Scotland, are two celebrated lead mines,\r\nwhich yield annually above two thousand tuns of metal. The Susannah-vein\r\nlead-hills, have been worked for many years, and have been productive of\r\ngreat wealth. The above are considered as the richest lead mines of\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nSeveral of the Irish lead mines have yielded a considerable proportion\r\nof silver; and mention is made of one, in the county of Antrim, which\r\nafforded, in thirty pounds of lead, a pound of that metal. Another, less\r\nproductive of silver, was found at Ballysadare, near the harbor of\r\nSligo, in Connaught; and a third in the county of Tipperary, thirty\r\nmiles from Limerick. The ores of this last were of two kinds, most\r\nusually of a reddish color, hard and glittering; the other, which was\r\nthe richest in silver, resembled a blue marl. The works were destroyed\r\nin the Irish insurrections in the reign of Charles I. The mine, however,\r\nis still wrought on account of the lead it contains.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COAL MINES.\r\n\r\nCoal is one of the most valuable of all mineral treasures, and one that\r\nis of the highest service in making the others available to the use and\r\ncomfort of man. And hence it has been searched after with unremitting\r\ndiligence, and worked with all the lights of science and the resources\r\nof art. It is found in beds or strata, in that group of the secondary\r\nrocks which includes the red sandstone and mountain limestone\r\nformations, commonly called the _carboniferous group_, or the _coal\r\nmeasures_. From the peculiarities of their position, they are often\r\nspoken of as _coal-basins_, and _coal-fields_.\r\n\r\nThere are two or three points of some theoretical interest and\r\nimportance as to the origin of coal, on which geological authorities are\r\nnearly unanimous. One is, that our present coal is exclusively of\r\nvegetable origin, formed apparently from the destruction of vast forests\r\nand immense quantities of leaves and shrubs; another, that it was formed\r\nwhen the climate of the regions where it is found was not merely\r\ntropical, but ultra-tropical, instead of being as now, temperate; and a\r\nthird, that its deposits, though originally regular, have evidently been\r\nsince elevated, and often singularly dislocated and contorted by forces\r\nacting from below, and probably of a volcanic nature. Each of these\r\npoints will more or less appear in the progress of the following\r\nremarks.\r\n\r\nThat the coal formations are of vegetable origin, is perfectly evident\r\nfrom even a slight examination, especially with the microscope. Let a\r\npiece of coal be cut in very thin slices, or plates, and its appearance\r\nwill be like that seen in the following cut. The vegetable fossils thus\r\nshown are, indeed, very different from any existing species, unless it\r\nbe a few which are the productions only of torrid climates. And while\r\nthe cut gives the appearance of but a _single leaf_ in each specimen,\r\nthe masses of coal are generally more like one thick imbedded mass of\r\nleaves, not so much _crushed together_, as _overlaying_ and _mixed with_\r\neach other. According to Dr. Linley, the coal vegetation consisted of\r\nferns, in great abundance; of large coniferous trees, of a species\r\nresembling =lycopodiacæ=, but of most gigantic dimensions; of a numerous\r\ntribe apparently analogous to =cactæ=, but probably not identical with\r\nthem; of palm, and other _monocotyledones_; and finally, of numerous\r\nvines, plants, &c., the exact nature of which is uncertain. Where\r\n_leaves_ most abound, the coal is said to be of the best quality; though\r\nas any one kind of coal hardens, the impressions of such leaves become\r\ngradually less distinct, until finally they can hardly be traced, even\r\nwith a powerful magnifier. A hundred and twenty varieties of these\r\nvegetable impressions have been found in the vicinity of Pottsville, in\r\nthe course of a few months, each as distinctly marked as the most\r\ndelicate tracings of an artist’s pencil; and in almost any coal\r\nformation, there are so many hundreds of different plants, trees, and\r\nflowers, that a single representative of each kind would form a vast\r\nmuseum. Specimens which exhibit impressions of the bark, limbs, or\r\ntrunks of trees, are, of course, correspondingly large and heavy, and\r\ncould not easily be sketched in a small engraving, while the variety of\r\nleaves and flowers is so great, that it would be tedious to mention and\r\ndescribe them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THIN PLATES OF COAL.]\r\n\r\nWith these few remarks, we proceed to notice first, some of the coal\r\nmines of Great Britain, and then some of our own country. Perhaps there\r\nis no country where coal mines are so rich, so frequent, and so\r\nsuccessfully worked thus far, as those of Great Britain; and it is to\r\nthis cause that the opulence of that country has often been chiefly\r\nascribed. It is, in truth, the coal of her mines, that is the very life\r\nof her manufactures, and consequently of her commerce, every\r\nmanufacturing town being established in the midst of a coal country. Of\r\nthis striking instances are afforded by Bristol, Birmingham,\r\nWolverhampton, Sheffield, Newcastle, and Glasgow.\r\n\r\nThe coals of Whitehaven and Wigan are esteemed the purest; and the\r\ncannel and peacock coals of Lancashire are so beautiful, that they are\r\nsuspected by some to have constituted the _gagates_, or jet, which the\r\nancients ascribed to Great Britain. In Somersetshire, the Mendip coal\r\nmines are distinguished by their productiveness: they occur there, as\r\nindeed in every other part, in the _low_ country, and are not to be\r\nfound in the hills. The beds of coal are not horizontal, but sloping,\r\ndipping to the south-east at the rate of about twenty-two inches per\r\nfathom. Hence they would speedily sink so deep that it would not be\r\npossible to work them, were it not that they are intersected at\r\nintervals by perpendicular dikes or veins, of a different kind of\r\nmineral, on the other side of which these beds are found considerably\r\nraised up. They are seven in number, lying at regular distances beneath\r\neach other, and separated by beds of a different kind of substance, the\r\ndeepest being placed more than two hundred feet beneath the surface of\r\nthe earth.\r\n\r\nThe town of Newcastle, in Northumberland, has been celebrated during\r\nseveral centuries for its very extensive trade in coal. It was first\r\nmade a borough by William the Conqueror, and the earliest charter for\r\ndigging coals, granted to the inhabitants, was in the reign of Henry\r\nIII., in 1239; but in 1306, the use of coal for fuel was prohibited in\r\nLondon, by royal proclamation, chiefly because it injured the sale of\r\nwood, with which the environs of the capital were then overspread. This\r\ninterdict did not, however, continue long in force; and coals may be\r\nconsidered as having been dug for exportation at Newcastle for more than\r\nfour centuries. It has been estimated that there are twenty-four\r\nconsiderable collieries lying at different distances from the river,\r\nfrom five to eighteen miles; and that they produced, for an average of\r\nsix years, up to the close of 1776, an annual consumption of three\r\nhundred and eighty thousand chaldrons, Newcastle measure, (equal to\r\nseven hundred and seventeen thousand, six hundred and fifteen chaldrons,\r\nLondon measure,) of which about thirty thousand chaldrons were exported\r\nto foreign parts. The boats employed in the colliery are called _keels_,\r\nand are described as strong, clumsy, and oval, each carrying about\r\ntwenty tuns; and of these four hundred and fifty are kept constantly\r\nemployed. In the year 1776 an estimate was made of the shipping employed\r\nin the Newcastle coal trade; and from this estimate it appears, that\r\nthree thousand, five hundred and eighty-five ships, were during that\r\nyear engaged in the coasting trade, and three hundred and sixty-three in\r\nthe trade to foreign ports, their joint tunnage amounting to seven\r\nhundred and thirty-eight thousand, two hundred and fourteen tuns.\r\n\r\nAs already said, it is a common opinion among geologists, that coal is\r\nof vegetable origin, and that it has been brought to its present state\r\nby the means of some chemical process, not at this time understood. This\r\nopinion is abundantly supported by the existence of vast depositions of\r\nmatter, halfway, as it were, between perfect wood and perfect coal;\r\nwhich, while it obviously betrays its vegetable nature, has in several\r\nrespects so near an approximation to coal, as to have been generally\r\ndistinguished by the name of coal. One of the most remarkable of these\r\ndepositions exists in Devonshire, about thirteen miles south-west of\r\nExeter, and is well known under the name of Bovey coal. Its vegetable\r\nnature has been ascertained by Mr. Hatchet, in a set of experiments in\r\nwhich he found both extractive matter and resin, substances which belong\r\nto the vegetable kingdom.\r\n\r\nThe beds of this coal are seventy feet in thickness, and are\r\ninterspersed with beds of clay. On the north side they lie within a foot\r\nof the surface, and dip south at the rate of about twenty inches per\r\nfathom. The deepest beds are the blackest and heaviest, and have the\r\nclosest resemblance to coal, while the upper ones strongly resemble\r\nwood, and are considered as such by those who dig them. They are brown,\r\nand become extremely friable when dry, burning with a flame similar to\r\nthat of wood, and assuming the appearance of wood which has been\r\nrendered soft by some unknown cause, and, while in that state, has been\r\ncrushed flat by the weight of the incumbent earth. This is the case, not\r\nonly with the Bovey coal, but also with all the beds of wood-coal which\r\nhave been hitherto examined in different parts of Europe.[5]\r\n\r\nFootnote 5:\r\n\r\n  We are informed by Liebig and other eminent chemists, that when wood\r\n  and other vegetable matter are buried in the earth, exposed to\r\n  moisture, and partially or entirely excluded from the air, they\r\n  decompose slowly, and evolve carbonic acid gas; thus parting with a\r\n  portion of their original oxygen. By this means they are gradually\r\n  converted into lignite, or wood-coal, which contains a larger\r\n  proportion of hydrogen than wood does. A continuance of decomposition\r\n  changes this lignite into common or bituminous coal, chiefly by the\r\n  discharge of carbureted hydrogen, or the gas by which we illuminate\r\n  our streets and houses. According to Birchoff, the inflammable gases\r\n  which are always escaping from mineral coal, and are so often the\r\n  cause of fatal accidents in mines, always contain carbonic acid,\r\n  carbureted hydrogen, nitrogen, and olefiant gas. The disengagement of\r\n  all these gradually transforms ordinary or bituminous coal into\r\n  anthracite, to which the various names of splint-coal, glance-coal,\r\n  culm, and many others, have been given.\r\n\r\nThe coal mines of Whitehaven may be considered as among the most\r\nextraordinary in the known world. They are excavations which have, in\r\ntheir structure, a considerable resemblance to the gypsum quarries of\r\nParis, and are of such magnitude and extent, that in one of them alone,\r\na sum exceeding half a million sterling, was, in the course of a\r\ncentury, expended by the proprietors. Their principal entrance is by an\r\nopening at the bottom of a hill, through a long passage hewn in the\r\nrock, leading to the lowest vein of coal. The greater part of this\r\ndescent is through spacious galleries, which continually intersect other\r\ngalleries, all the coal being cut away, with the exception of large\r\npillars, which, where the mine runs to a considerable depth, are nine\r\nfeet in hight, and about thirty-six feet square at the base. Such is the\r\nstrength there required to support the ponderous roof.\r\n\r\nThe mines are sunk to the depth of one hundred and thirty fathoms, and\r\nare extended under the sea to places where there is, above them,\r\nsufficient depth of water for ships of large burden. These are the\r\ndeepest coal mines which have hitherto been wrought; and perhaps the\r\nminers have not, in any other part of the globe, penetrated to so great\r\na depth beneath the surface of the sea, the very deep mines in Hungary,\r\nPeru and elsewhere, being situated in mountainous countries, where the\r\nsurface of the earth is elevated to a great hight above the level of the\r\nocean.\r\n\r\nIn these mines there are three strata of coal, which lie at a\r\nconsiderable distance one above the other, and are made to communicate\r\nby pits; but the vein is not always continued in the same regularly\r\ninclined plane, the miners frequently meeting with hard rock, by which\r\ntheir further progress is interrupted. At such places there seem to have\r\nbeen breaks in the earth, from the surface downward, one portion\r\nappearing to have sunk down, while the adjoining part has preserved its\r\nancient situation. In some of these places the earth has sunk ten,\r\ntwenty fathoms, and even more; while in others the depression has been\r\nless than one fathom. These breaks the miners call _dikes_, and when\r\nthey reach one of them, their first care is to discover whether the\r\nstrata in the adjoining part are higher or lower than in the part where\r\nthey have been working; or, according to their own phrase, whether the\r\ncoal be _cast down_ or _cast up_. In the former case they sink a pit;\r\nbut if it be cast up to any considerable hight, they are frequently\r\nobliged, with great labor and expense, to carry forward a level, or long\r\ngallery, through the rock, until they again reach the stratum of coal.\r\n\r\nCoal, the chief mineral of Scotland, has been there worked for a\r\nsuccession of ages. Pope Pius II., in his description of Europe, written\r\nabout 1450, mentions that he beheld with wonder black stones given as\r\nalms to the poor of Scotland. This mineral may, however, be traced to\r\nthe twelfth century; and a very early account of the Scottish coal\r\nmines, explains with great precision, the manner of working the coal,\r\nnot neglecting to mention the subterraneous walls of _whin_ which\r\nintersect the strata, particularly a remarkable one, visible from the\r\nriver Tyne, where it forms a cataract, and passes by Prestonpans, to the\r\nshore of Fife. The Lothians and Fifeshire, particularly abound with this\r\nuseful mineral, which also extends into Ayrshire; and near Irwin is\r\nfound a curious variety, named ribbon-coal. A singular coal, in veins of\r\nmineral, has been found at Castle Leod, in the east of Ross-shire; and\r\nit is conjectured that the largest untouched field of coal in Europe,\r\nexists in a barren tract of country in Lanarkshire.\r\n\r\nThe process of mining coal is a combination of boring and digging.\r\nShafts are sunk, levels are driven, and drains are carried off, by the\r\nhelp of picks or pickaxes, wedges and hammers, the rocks being also\r\nsometimes loosened by blasting with gunpowder. In searching for coal, a\r\nshaft is sunk through the uppermost soft stratum, and the rock is then\r\nbored, by striking it continually with an iron borer terminating in an\r\nedge of steel, which is in the mean time turned partly round; and, at\r\nproper intervals, a scoop is let down to draw up the loose fragments. In\r\nthis manner a perforation is sometimes made for more than an hundred\r\nfathoms, the borer being lengthened by pieces screwed on; it is then\r\npartly supported by a counterpoise, and worked by machinery. Should it\r\nhappen to break, the piece is raised by a rod furnished with a hollow\r\ncone, as an extinguisher, which is driven down on it. The borer is\r\nsometimes furnished with knives, which are made to act on any part at\r\npleasure, and to scrape off a portion of the surrounding substance,\r\nwhich is collected in a proper receptacle.\r\n\r\nThose who have the direction of deep and extensive coal mines, are\r\nobliged, with great art and care, to keep them ventilated with perpetual\r\ncurrents of fresh air, which afford the miners a constant supply of that\r\nvital fluid, and expel from the mines damps and other noxious\r\nexhalations, together with such other burnt and foul air, as has become\r\ndeleterious and unfit for respiration. In the deserted mines, which are\r\nnot thus ventilated with currents of fresh air, large quantities of\r\nthese damps are frequently collected; and in such works they often\r\nremain for a long time without doing any mischief. But when, by some\r\naccident, they are set on fire, they then produce dreadful explosions,\r\nand, bursting out of the pits with great impetuosity, like the fiery\r\neruptions from burning mountains, force along with them ponderous bodies\r\nto a great hight in the air.\r\n\r\nVarious instances have occurred in which the coal has been set on fire\r\nby the fulminating damp, and has continued burning for several months,\r\nuntil large streams of water were conducted into the mine, so as to\r\ninundate the parts where the conflagration existed. By such fires\r\nseveral collieries have been entirely destroyed, in the vicinity of\r\nNewcastle, and in other parts of England, as well as in Fifeshire, in\r\nScotland. In some of these places the fire has continued to burn for\r\nages. To prevent, therefore, as much as possible, the collieries from\r\nbeing filled with these pernicious damps, it has been found necessary\r\ncarefully to search for the crevices in the coal whence they issue, and,\r\nat those places, to confine them within a narrow space, conducting them\r\nthrough large pipes into the open air, where, being set on fire, they\r\nconsume in perpetual flame as they continually arise out of the earth.\r\n\r\nMr. Spelling, an engineer of the Whitehaven coal mines, having observed\r\nthat the fulminating damp could only be kindled by flame, and that it\r\nwas not liable to be set on fire by red-hot iron, nor by the sparks\r\nproduced by the collision of flint and steel, invented a machine called\r\na steel-mill, in which a wheel of that metal is turned round with a very\r\nrapid motion, and, by the application of flints, great plenty of sparks\r\nare emitted, which afford the miners such a light as enables them to\r\ncarry on their work in close places, where the flame of a candle, or a\r\nlamp, would, as has already happened in various instances, occasion\r\nviolent explosions. In that dreadful catastrophe, the explosion of the\r\nFelling colliery, the particulars of which will be hereafter detailed,\r\nit will be seen that mills of this description were employed, in\r\nsearching for the remains of the victims of the sad disaster; but this\r\nevent happened before the invention of Sir Humphrey Davy’s safety-lamp,\r\na discovery which, while it affords a more certain light, holds out\r\nevery security to the miner against accidents which, without such a\r\nresource, might still be superadded to those already recorded, as\r\narising from the flame of a candle or lamp.\r\n\r\nA greater number of mines have, however, been ruined by inundations than\r\nby fires; and here that noble invention, the fire-engine, displays its\r\nbeneficial effects. It appears from nice calculations, that it would\r\nrequire about five hundred and fifty men, or a power equal to that of\r\none hundred and ten horses, to work the pumps of one of the largest\r\nfire-engines, having a cylinder seventy inches in diameter, now in use,\r\nand thrice that number of men to keep an engine of that size constantly\r\nat work. It also appears that as much water may be raised by such an\r\nengine, as can be drawn, within the same space of time, by twenty-five\r\nhundred and twenty men with rollers and buckets, after the manner long\r\npracticed in many mines; or as much as can be borne on the shoulders of\r\ntwice that number of men, as is said to be done in several of the mines\r\nof Peru. So great is the power of the elastic steam of the boiling water\r\nin those engines, and of the outward atmosphere, which, by their\r\nalternate actions give force and motion to the beam, and through it to\r\nthe pump rods which elevate the water through tubes, and discharge it\r\nfrom the mine!\r\n\r\nYears since there were four fire-engines belonging to the Whitehaven\r\ncolliery, which when all at work, discharged from it about twelve\r\nhundred and twenty-eight gallons of water every minute, at thirteen\r\nstrokes; and at the same rate, one million, seven hundred and\r\nsixty-eight thousand, three hundred and twenty gallons, upward of seven\r\nthousand tuns, every twenty-four hours. By these engines nearly twice\r\nthe above-mentioned quantity of water might be discharged from mines not\r\nmore than sixty or seventy fathoms deep, which depth is rarely exceeded\r\nin the Newcastle collieries, or in any other English collieries, with\r\nthe exception of the above.\r\n\r\nCoal pits have sometimes taken fire by accident, and have continued to\r\nburn for a considerable length of time. About the year 1648, a coal mine\r\nat Benwell, a village near Newcastle-upon-Tyne, was accidentally kindled\r\nby a candle: at first the fire was so feeble, that a reward of half a\r\ncrown, which was asked by a person who offered to extinguish it, was\r\nrefused. It gradually increased, however, and had continued burning for\r\nthirty years, when the account was drawn up and published in the\r\nPhilosophical Transactions: it was not finally extinguished until all\r\nthe fuel was consumed. Examples of a similar kind have happened in\r\nScotland and in Germany.\r\n\r\nBut of all the recorded accidents relative to coal mines, that of\r\nFelling colliery, near Sunderland, a concise narrative of which here\r\nfollows, was the most disastrous.\r\n\r\nFelling is a manor about a mile and a half east of Gateshead. It\r\ncontains several strata of coal, the uppermost of which were extensively\r\nwrought in the beginning of the last century. The stratum called the\r\nhigh-main, was begun in 1779, and continued to be wrought till the\r\nnineteenth of January, 1811, when it was entirely excavated. The present\r\ncolliery was in the seam called the low-main. It commenced in October,\r\n1810, and was at full work in May, 1812. This mine was considered by the\r\nworkmen as a model of perfection in the purity of its air, and orderly\r\narrangements; its inclined plane was saving the daily expense of at\r\nleast thirteen horses; the concern wore the features of the greatest\r\npossible prosperity, and no accident, except a trifling explosion of\r\nfire-damp, slightly burning two or three workmen, had occurred. Two\r\n_shifts_, or sets of men, were constantly employed, except on Sundays.\r\nTwenty-five acres of coal had been excavated. The first shift entered\r\nthe mine at four o’clock, A. M., and were relieved at their\r\nworking-posts by the next at eleven o’clock in the morning. The\r\nestablishment employed under ground, consisted of about one hundred and\r\ntwenty-eight persons, who, from the eleventh to the twenty-fifth of May,\r\n1812, wrought six hundred and twenty-four scores of coal, equal to\r\nthirteen hundred Newcastle, or twenty-four hundred and fifty-five London\r\nchaldrons.\r\n\r\nAbout half past eleven o’clock, on the morning of the twenty-fifth of\r\nMay, 1812, the neighboring villages were alarmed by a tremendous\r\nexplosion in this colliery. The subterraneous fire broke forth with two\r\nheavy discharges from the low-main, which were almost instantaneously\r\nfollowed by one from the high-main. A slight trembling, as from an\r\nearthquake, was felt for about half a mile around the workings; and the\r\nnoise of the explosion, though dull, was heard to three or four miles’\r\ndistance, and much resembled an unsteady fire of infantry. Immense\r\nquantities of dust and small coal accompanied these blasts, and rose\r\nhigh into the air, in the form of an inverted cone. The heaviest part of\r\nthe ejected matter, such as corves, pieces of wood, and small coal, fell\r\nnear the pits; but the dust, borne away by a strong west wind, fell in a\r\ncontinued shower from the pit to the distance of a mile and a half. As\r\nsoon as the explosion was heard, the wives and children of the workmen\r\nran to the pit; the scene was distressing beyond the power of\r\ndescription.\r\n\r\nOf one hundred and twenty-eight persons in the mine at the time of the\r\nexplosion, only thirty-two were brought to daylight: twenty-nine\r\nsurvived the fatal combustion; the rest were destroyed. Nor from the\r\ntime of the explosion till the eighth of July, could any person descend.\r\nBut after many unsuccessful attempts to explore the burning mine, it was\r\nreclosed, to prevent the atmospheric air from entering it: this being\r\ndone, no attempt was afterward made to explore it, till the morning of\r\nthe last-mentioned day; from which time to the nineteenth of September,\r\nthe heart-rending scene of mothers and widows examining the putrid\r\nbodies of their sons and husbands, for marks by which to identify them,\r\nwas almost daily renewed; but very few of them were known by any\r\npersonal mark; they were too much mangled and scorched to retain any of\r\ntheir features. Their clothes, tobacco-boxes, shoes, &c., were,\r\ntherefore, the only indexes by which they could be recognized.\r\n\r\nAt the crane twenty-one bodies lay in ghastly confusion: some like\r\nmummies, scorched as dry as if they were baked. One wanted its head,\r\nanother an arm. The scene was truly frightful. The power of fire was\r\nvisible upon them all; but its effects were extremely variable: while\r\nsome were almost torn to pieces, there were others who appeared as if\r\nthey had sunk down overpowered with sleep. The ventilation concluded on\r\nSaturday the nineteenth of September, when the ninety-first body was dug\r\nfrom under a heap of stones. At six o’clock in the morning the pit was\r\nvisited by candle-light, which had not been used in it for the space of\r\none hundred and seventeen days; and at eleven o’clock in the morning the\r\ntube furnace was lighted. From this time the colliery has been regularly\r\nat work; but the ninety-second body has never yet been found. All these\r\npersons, except four, who were buried in single graves, were interred in\r\nHeworth chapel-yard, in a trench, side by side, two coffins deep, with a\r\npartition of brick and lime between every four coffins.\r\n\r\nHaving thus glanced at some of the coal mines of Great Britain, we now\r\npass to some of those of the United States. In these coal is found in\r\n_four_ different forms: _first_, the _genuine_ anthracite, or _glance_\r\ncoal, as near Worcester, Mass., and Newport, R. I.; _second_, coal\r\ndestitute of bitumen, commonly called anthracite, but which is more\r\nproperly anasphaltic, which is found at Pottsville, Mauch Chunk,\r\nLackawanna, Wilkesbarre, &c.; _third_, bituminous coal, usually found in\r\nthe slate rock, as at Tioga, Lycoming, etc.; and _fourth_, the lignite\r\ncoal, found along the south shore of the bay of South Amboy, New Jersey.\r\nFrom the state of Alabama to Pictou, Nova Scotia, the coal beds can be\r\nfollowed in a north-east direction, for fifteen hundred miles; and from\r\nRichmond, in Virginia, to Rock River, in Illinois, they are continually\r\ncrossed at right angles, for about eight hundred miles. At Richmond, the\r\ncoal is bituminous; on the Alleghany belt, it is anthracite. Geologists\r\nthink that the anthracite was lifted out of its horizontal position when\r\nthe great Alleghany belt was upheaved, and that its non-bituminous\r\nquality is owing to the influence of the intense heat that accompanied\r\nits upheaval.\r\n\r\nTaylor, in his book on coal, estimates the area of bituminous coal in\r\nthe United States, east of the Mississippi river, at one hundred and\r\ntwenty-four thousand, seven hundred and thirty-five square miles, and\r\nwest of the Mississippi, at eight thousand, three hundred and\r\nninety-seven square miles; British North America, eighteen thousand\r\nsquare miles bituminous. More than one-third of the area of\r\nPennsylvania, is more or less marked by coal formations; one-third of\r\nKentucky, Ohio and Virginia, one-fifth of Indiana, and three-fourths of\r\nIllinois, are occupied by carboniferous strata. Western Pennsylvania\r\nabounds in bituminous coal, and it is found also in several counties of\r\nNew York. By the census of 1839-40, we find that the quantity of\r\nbituminous coal produced that year in the United States, was\r\ntwenty-seven million, six hundred and three thousand, one hundred and\r\nninety-one bushels, employing about four thousand men, and a capital of\r\nsome two million dollars; and that about four million dollars of capital\r\nwere invested in raising anthracite coal, of which some nine hundred\r\nthousand tuns (of about twenty-eight bushels each) were produced by the\r\nlabors of about three thousand men. Most of this was from Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nIn 1819, the anthracite coal trade had no existence; in 1820, this kind\r\nof coal was first used as fuel, and just three hundred and sixty-five\r\ntuns were sent to market; in 1845, the amount was two million tuns; in\r\n1850, about three million, five hundred thousand tuns, and the present\r\nyear (1854) the amount will probably be between six and seven million\r\ntuns. The demand and supply so steadily and rapidly increase that it is\r\nimpossible to estimate the vast extent the business of coal mining is\r\nyet to attain.\r\n\r\nGlancing for a moment at other countries, we find that Belgium, in 1845,\r\nhad two hundred and twelve mines, employing thirty-eight thousand miners\r\nand five hundred steam-engines, and producing five million tuns; France,\r\nfour hundred and forty-nine mines, employing thirty thousand miners, and\r\nproducing five million tuns; Prussia, in 1840, seven hundred and\r\nfifty-two mines, employing twenty-four thousand miners, and raising\r\nthree million, five hundred thousand tuns; and that Great Britain, in\r\n1846, produced thirty-five million tuns, valued at forty-five million\r\ndollars at the mines. Austria and Spain, also, have excellent mines,\r\nthough less productive. And as a late and interesting discovery, it may\r\nbe added, that the recent Arctic expedition sent out from England, found\r\ncoal in those northern regions, on the island of Disco, outcropping near\r\nthe shore. They also, in another locality not far off, discovered some\r\ncurious specimens of petrified trees, and near them extensive quarries\r\nof anthracite coal, of good quality. There appeared to be no limit to\r\nthe quantity that might be thrown into a boat with ease, and in the\r\nspace of three hours they conveyed not less than twelve tuns to the\r\nsteamer, three-quarters of a mile distant. It proved, on trial, to be of\r\ngood quality, the combustion was perfect, and the coal as economical as\r\nthe Welsh.\r\n\r\nWe will conclude the subject of coal mines, with the statement of a\r\nrecent tourist, as to some of the wonders of the Cornish mines in\r\nEngland, as he saw them in 1854. He says: “Some of the mines are truly\r\ngrand undertakings. The ‘consolidated mines,’ the largest of the Cornish\r\ngroup, employ upward of three thousand persons. One of the engines pumps\r\nwater from a direct depth of sixteen hundred feet, the weight of the\r\npumping apparatus alone being upward of five hundred tuns; the\r\npumping-rod is one thousand, seven hundred and forty feet long, and it\r\nraises about two million gallons of water in a week, from a depth equal\r\nto five times the hight of St. Paul’s. These are, indeed, wonders to\r\nmarvel at! The consolidated and united mines, both belonging to one\r\ncompany, are stated to have used the following vast quantities of\r\nmaterials in a year: coals, fifteen thousand, two hundred and seventy\r\ntuns; candles, one hundred and thirty-two thousand, one hundred and\r\nforty-four pounds; gunpowder, eighty-two thousand pounds; leather, for\r\nstraps, &c., thirteen thousand, four hundred and ninety-three pounds;\r\npick and shovel handles, sixteen thousand, six hundred and ninety-eight\r\ndozens. Sir Charles Lemon has estimated, that in the whole of the\r\nCornish mines, thirteen thousand pounds’ worth of gunpowder is used\r\nannually; that the timber employed in the underground works, equals the\r\ngrowth of one hundred and forty square miles of Norwegian forest; and\r\nthat thirty-seven million tuns of water are raised annually from the\r\nmines.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                              SALT MINES.\r\n\r\n         Hence with diffusive salt old Ocean steeps,\r\n         His emerald shallows, and his sapphire deeps.\r\n         Oft in wide lakes, around their warmer brim,\r\n         In hollow pyramids the crystals swim;\r\n         Or, fused by earth-born fires, in cubic blocks\r\n         Shoot their wide forms, and harden into rocks.—DARWIN.\r\n\r\nCulinary salt, or, as it is termed in chemistry, muriate of soda, exists\r\nabundantly in a native state, both in a solid form, and dissolved in\r\nwater. It occurs, in solution, not only throughout the wide range of the\r\nocean, but in various springs, rivers and lakes; and is known, in its\r\nsolid form, as a peculiar mineral, under the names of _rock-salt_,\r\n_fossil salt_, and _salt-gem_. Its beds are mostly beneath the surface\r\nof the ground, but sometimes rise into hills of considerable elevation.\r\nAt Cordova, in Spain, a hill, between four and five hundred feet in\r\nhight, is nearly composed of this mineral. But the most celebrated salt\r\nmines are those of Wielicza, in Gallicia, commonly called the salt mines\r\nof Cracow, those of Tyrol, of Castile, (in Spain,) and of Cheshire, in\r\nEngland. In the province of Lahore, in Hindoostan, is a hill of\r\nrock-salt, of equal magnitude with that near Cordova. The mines of\r\nIletski, in Russia, yield vast quantities of this substance. It is so\r\nplentiful in the desert of Caramania, and the air so dry, that it is\r\nthere used as a material for building. It forms the surface of a large\r\npart of the northern desert of Lybia; and is found in great abundance in\r\nthe mountains of Peru. It has a pure saline taste, without any mixture\r\nof bitterness; and crystallizes in cubes when obtained by slow\r\nevaporation from its solution. In Germany the mines of this kind are\r\nnumerous: one of the largest is that of Hallein, near Saltzburg, in\r\nwhich the salt is hewn out from subterraneous caverns of a considerable\r\nrange, and exhibits almost every diversity of color, as yellow, red,\r\nblue and white; in consequence of which it is dissolved in water, to be\r\nliberated from its impurities, and afterward recrystallized. The salt\r\nmines of Cracow, and those of Cheshire, merit a particular description.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         SALT MINES OF CRACOW.\r\n\r\n       Thus, cavern’d round, in Cracow’s mighty mines,\r\n       With crystal walls a gorgeous city shines;\r\n       Scoop’d in the briny rock long streets extend\r\n       Their hoary course, and glittering domes ascend:\r\n       Down their bright steeps, emerging into day,\r\n       Impetuous fountains burst their headlong way,\r\n       O’er milk-white vales in ivory channels spread,\r\n       And wondering seek their subterraneous bed.\r\n       Form’d in pellucid salt, with chisel nice,\r\n       The pale lamp glittering through the sculptur’d ice,\r\n       With wild reverted eyes fair Lotta stands,\r\n       And spreads to heaven, in vain, her glassy hands;\r\n       Cold dews condense upon her pearly breast,\r\n       And the big tear rolls lucid down her vest.\r\n       Far gleaming o’er the town, transparent fanes\r\n       Rear their white towers, and wave their golden vanes:\r\n       Long lines of lusters pour their trembling rays,\r\n       And the bright vault resounds with mingled blaze.—DARWIN.\r\n\r\nThese celebrated excavations are about five miles distant from the city\r\nof Cracow, in a small town named Wielicza, which is entirely undermined,\r\nthe cavities reaching to a considerable extent beyond its limits. The\r\nlength of the great mine, a view of which is seen on the next page, from\r\neast to west, is six thousand feet; its breadth, from north to south,\r\ntwo thousand; and its greatest depth eight hundred; but the veins of\r\nsalt are not limited to this extent, the depth and length of them, from\r\neast to west, being yet unknown, and their breadth only, hitherto\r\ndetermined. There are at present ten shafts; and not a single spring has\r\nbeen discovered throughout the extent of the mine.\r\n\r\nIn descending to the bottom, the visitor is surprised to find a kind of\r\nsubterraneous commonwealth, consisting of many families, who have their\r\npeculiar laws and polity. Here are likewise public roads and carriages,\r\nhorses being employed to draw the salt to the mouths of the mine, where\r\nit is taken up by engines. These horses, when once arrived at their\r\ndestination, never more see the light of the sun; and many of the people\r\nseem buried alive in this strange abyss, having been born there, and\r\nnever stirring out; while others are not denied frequent opportunities\r\nof breathing the fresh air in the fields, and enjoying the surrounding\r\nprospects. The subterraneous passages, or galleries, are very spacious,\r\nand in many of them chapels are hewn out of the rock-salt. In these\r\npassages crucifixes are set up, together with the images of saints,\r\nbefore which a light is kept constantly burning. The places where the\r\nsalt is hewn out, and the empty cavities whence it has been removed, are\r\ncalled chambers, in several of which, where the water has stagnated, the\r\nbottoms and sides are covered with very thick incrustations of thousands\r\nof salt crystals, lying one on the other, and many of them weighing half\r\na pound and upward. When candles are placed before them, the numerous\r\nrays of light reflected by these crystals emit a surprising luster.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GREAT SALT MINE OF CRACOW.]\r\n\r\nIn several parts of the mine, huge columns of salt are left standing, to\r\nsupport the rock; and these are very fancifully ornamented. But the most\r\ncurious object in the inhabited part, or subterraneous town, is a statue\r\nwhich is considered by the immured inhabitants as the actual\r\ntransmutation of Lot’s wife into a pillar of salt; and in proportion as\r\nthis statue appears either dry or moist, the state of the weather above\r\nground is inferred. The windings in this mine are so numerous and\r\nintricate, that the workmen have frequently lost their way; and several,\r\nwhose lights have been extinguished, have thus perished. The number of\r\nminers to whom it gives employment, is computed at between four and five\r\nhundred; but the whole amount of the men employed in it is about seven\r\nhundred.\r\n\r\nThe salt lies near the surface, in large, shapeless masses, from which\r\nblocks of sixty, eighty, or a hundred feet square, may be hewn; but at a\r\nconsiderable depth it is found in smaller lumps. About six hundred\r\nthousand quintals of salt are dug annually out of the mines of Cracow.\r\nThe worst and cheapest is called green salt, from its greenish color,\r\noccasioned by a heterogenous mixture of a grayish mineral, or clay, and\r\nentirely consists of salt crystals of different dimensions. A finer sort\r\nis dug out in large blocks; and the third kind is the _sal gemmæ_, or\r\ncrystal salt, which is found in small pieces interspersed in the rock,\r\nand, when detached from it, breaks into cubes of rectangular prisms.\r\nThis is usually sold unprepared. The color of the salt stone is a dark\r\ngray mixed with yellow.\r\n\r\n\r\n              SALT MINES AND SPRINGS OF CHESHIRE, ENGLAND.\r\n\r\nThe Cheshire rock-salt, with very few exceptions, has hitherto been\r\nascertained to exist only in the valleys bordering on the river Weaver\r\nand its tributary streams; in some places manifesting its presence by\r\nsprings impregnated with salt, and in others being known by mines\r\nactually carried down into the substance of the salt strata. Between the\r\nsource of the Weaver and Nantwich, many brine springs make their\r\nappearance; and occur again at several places, in proceeding down the\r\nstream. At Moulton, a mine has been sunk into the body of rock-salt, and\r\na similar mine is wrought near Middlewich. At Northwich, brine springs\r\nare very abundant; and there also many mines have been sunk for the\r\npurpose of working out the fossil salt. In that vicinity a body of\r\nrock-salt has been met with in searching for coal.\r\n\r\nThe brines in this district are formed by the penetration of spring or\r\nrain waters to the upper surface of the rock-salt, in passing over which\r\nthey acquire such a degree of strength, that one hundred parts have\r\nyielded twenty-seven of pure salt, thus nearly approaching to the\r\nperfect saturation of brine. Their strength is therefore much greater\r\nthan that of the salt springs met with in Hungary, Germany and France.\r\nThe brine having been pumped out of the pits, is first conveyed into\r\nlarge reservoirs, and afterward drawn off as it is needed, into pans\r\nmade of wrought iron. Here heat is applied in a degree determined by the\r\nnature of the salt to be manufactured, and various additions are made to\r\nthe brine, with a view either to assist the crystallization of the salt,\r\nor to promote the separation of the earthy particles, which exist in a\r\nvery small proportion. The importance of the manufacture of Cheshire\r\nsalt will be sufficiently obvious from the statement, that, besides the\r\nsalt made for home consumption, the annual amount of which has exceeded\r\nsixteen thousand tuns, the average of the quantity sent yearly to\r\nLiverpool for exportation, has not been less than one hundred and forty\r\nthousand tuns.\r\n\r\nThe mine of rock-salt first worked was discovered by accident at\r\nMarbury, near Northwich about a century and a half ago; and this bed had\r\nbeen wrought for more than a century, when, in the same neighborhood, a\r\nsecond and inferior stratum was fallen in with, separated from the\r\nformer by a bed of indurated clay. This lower stratum was ascertained to\r\npossess a very great degree of purity, and freedom from earthy\r\nadmixture; on which account, and from the local advantages of Northwich\r\nfor exportation, the fossil salt is worked in the vicinity of that place\r\nonly. It occurs in two great strata or beds, lying nearly horizontally,\r\nand separated, the superincumbent from the subjacent stratum, by several\r\nlayers of indurated clay, or argillaceous stone. These intervening beds\r\npossess, in conjunction, a very uniform thickness of from thirty to\r\nthirty-five feet, and are irregularly penetrated by veins of fossil\r\nsalt. There is every reason to believe that the beds of rock-salt at\r\nNorthwich, are perfectly distinct from any others in the salt district,\r\nand form what are termed by mineralogists _incumbent bodies_ or _masses\r\nof mineral_.\r\n\r\nThese enormous masses stretch a mile and a half in a longitudinal\r\ndirection from north-east to south-west; but their transverse extent, as\r\nmeasured by a line at right angles from the former, does not exceed\r\nforty-two hundred feet, somewhat more than three-quarters of a mile.\r\nWithout this area, the brine which is met with, is of a very weak and\r\ninferior quality, and at a short distance disappears altogether. The\r\nthickness of the upper bed varies from sixty to ninety feet; and a\r\ngeneral estimate made from its level, shows that its upper surface,\r\nwhich is ninety feet beneath that of the earth, is at least thirty-six\r\nfeet beneath the low-water mark of the sea at Liverpool; a fact not\r\nunimportant in determining the nature of the formation of this mineral.\r\nThe thickness of the lower bed has not hitherto been ascertained; but\r\nthe workings are usually begun at the depth of from sixty to\r\nseventy-five feet, and are carried down for the space of fifteen or\r\neighteen feet, through what forms the purest portion of the bed. In one\r\nof the mines a shaft has been sunk to a level of forty-two feet still\r\nlower, without passing through the body of rock-salt. There is thus an\r\nascertained thickness of this bed of about a hundred and twenty feet,\r\nand without any direct evidence that it may not extend to a considerably\r\ngreater depth.\r\n\r\nAlthough two distinct beds, only, of fossil salt have been met with at\r\nNorthwich, it has been ascertained that the same limitations do not\r\nexist throughout the whole of the salt district. At Lawton, near the\r\nsource of the river Wheelock, three distinct beds have been found,\r\nseparated by strata of indurated clay: one at the depth of one hundred\r\nand twenty-six feet, four feet in thickness; a second, thirty feet\r\nlower, twelve feet in thickness; and a third, forty-five feet further\r\ndown, which was sunk into seventy-two feet, without passing through its\r\nsubstance. The intervening clay, the structure of which is very\r\npeculiar, is called the shaggy metal, and the fresh water which passes\r\nthrough its pores has the expressive appellation of Roaring Meg. This\r\nepithet will not appear too strong, when it is mentioned that in a mine\r\nin which the section of strata was taken, and where the “shaggy metal”\r\nwas found at the depth of about eighty feet, the quantity of water\r\nascertained to issue from its pores in one minute, was not less than\r\nthree hundred and sixty gallons; a circumstance which greatly enhances\r\nthe difficulty of passing a shaft down to the body of rock-salt.\r\n\r\nIn many of these beds of argillaceous stone, a portion of salt,\r\nsufficiently strong to affect the taste, is found to exist; and this\r\nsaltness increases, as might be expected, in proportion as the body of\r\nrock-salt is approached. In the strata or layers immediately above the\r\nrock, which in all the mines are perfectly uniform in their appearance\r\nand structure, this is particularly remarkable, notwithstanding there\r\nare not, in these strata, any veins of rock-salt connected with the\r\ngreat mass below. On the contrary, the line between the clay and\r\nrock-salt is drawn with great distinctness in every instance, without\r\npresenting any of those inequalities which would arise from a mutual\r\npenetration of the strata. Not any marine exuviæ, or organic remains,\r\nare found in the strata above the rock-salt; and the almost universal\r\noccurrence of gypsum, in connection with beds of fossil salt, is a fact\r\nstill more deserving of observation, because it appears, not only in\r\nthese mines, but also in the salt mines of Hungary, Poland and\r\nTransylvania; on which account Werner, in his geognostic system, assigns\r\nto the rock-salt and fletz gypsum a conjunct situation.\r\n\r\nThe fossil salt extracted from the Northwich mines is of different\r\ndegrees of purity, and more or less blended with earthy and metallic\r\nsubstances. The purer portion of the lower bed yields a rock-salt,\r\nwhich, being principally exported to the Baltic, obtains the name of\r\nPrussian rock. The extent of the cavity formed by the workings, varies\r\nin different mines, the average depth being about sixteen feet. In some\r\nof the pits, where pillars from eighteen to twenty-four feet square form\r\nthe supports of the mine, the appearance of the cavity is singularly\r\nstriking, and the brilliancy of the effect is greatly increased when the\r\nmine is illuminated by candles fixed to the sides of the rock. The scene\r\nthus formed almost appears to realize the magic palaces of eastern\r\npoets. Some of the pits are worked in aisles or streets, but the choice\r\nhere is wholly arbitrary. Among the methods employed in working out the\r\nrock-salt, the operation of blasting is applied to the separation of\r\nlarge masses from the body of the rock, and these are afterward broken\r\ndown by the mechanical implements in common use. The present number of\r\nmines is eleven or twelve, from which there are raised, on an annual\r\naverage, fifty or sixty thousand tuns of rock-salt. The greater part of\r\nthis quantity is exported to Ireland and the Baltic, the remainder being\r\nemployed in the Cheshire district, in the manufacture of white salt, by\r\nsolution and subsequent evaporation.\r\n\r\nThe general situation occupied by the rock-salt in Cheshire is very\r\nsimilar to that of the Transylvanian and Polish mines, the beds of this\r\nmineral being disposed in small plains, bounded by hills of\r\ninconsiderable hight, forming a kind of basin or hollow, from which\r\nthere is usually only a narrow egress for the waters. The situation of\r\nthe Austrian salt mines near Saltzburg is, however, very different. The\r\nmineral there appears to be disposed in beds of great thickness, which\r\noccur near the summits of limestone hills, at a great elevation above\r\nthe adjoining country. This is a singular fact; and if the hypothesis be\r\nallowed that rock-salt is formed from the waters of the sea, it is\r\nnecessary to suppose the occurrence on this spot of the most vast and\r\nsurprising changes!\r\n\r\nThough there are no salt _mines_ in the United States, there are salt\r\n_springs_ in several places. By far the most important and valuable of\r\nthese, are in the neighborhood of Syracuse, in the state of New York.\r\nThe land containing these springs, is owned by the state, and is leased\r\nfree of rent, to be used only for the manufacture of salt. The wells are\r\ndug, and the water pumped up at the expense of the state, and the\r\nmanufacturer pays a duty of one cent on each bushel he makes. Some of\r\nthe wells are sunk to the depth of four hundred feet. Fine salt is\r\nprepared by boiling; and coarse by solar evaporation. In 1850, the\r\nnumber of salt manufactories in this vicinity was one hundred and\r\nninety-two; and the quantity of salt produced in 1853, amounted to more\r\nthan five million bushels. The salt of this region has been thoroughly\r\ntested, and found to be fully equal to any of foreign manufacture.\r\n\r\n\r\n              -------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n                        PHENOMENA OF THE OCEAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  ------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n  “They that go down to the sea in ships, that do business in great\r\n  waters; these see the works of the Lord, and his wonders in the\r\n  deep.”—PSALMS.\r\n\r\n          “With wonder mark the moving wilderness of waves,\r\n          From pole to pole through boundless space diffused,\r\n          Magnificently dreadful! where, at large,\r\n          Leviathan, with each inferior name\r\n          Of sea-born kinds, ten thousand thousand tribes,\r\n          Find endless range for pasture and for sport.\r\n                                    Adoring own\r\n          The Hand Almighty, who in channeled bed\r\n          Immeasurable sunk, and poured abroad,\r\n          Fenced with eternal mounds, the fluid sphere;\r\n          With every wind to waft large commerce on.\r\n          Join pole to pole, consociate severed worlds,\r\n          And link in bonds of intercourse and love\r\n          Earth’s universal family.”—MALLET.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat huge mass of waters impregnated with salt, which encompasses all\r\nparts of the globe, and by the means of which, in the present improved\r\nstate of navigation, an easy intercourse subsists between the most\r\ndistant nations, is denominated the ocean, and has three grand divisions\r\nassigned to it. First, that vast expanse of water which lies to the\r\nwestward of the northern and southern continents of America, and by\r\nwhich those continents are divided from Asia. On account of the uniform\r\nand temperate gales which sweep its surface within the tropics, it is\r\nnamed the Pacific ocean; and has again been distinguished into the\r\nnorthern and southern Pacific, (the equator being considered as the\r\ndividing line,) and the Southern ocean, or South sea, being consequently\r\nthat part of the general assemblage of waters which is contained between\r\nthe fortieth degree of south latitude and the south pole. Its general\r\nwidth is estimated at about ten thousand miles. Secondly, the Atlantic\r\nocean, which divides Europe and Africa from the two American continents,\r\nand has a general width of about three thousand miles; while the waters\r\nwhich occupy the polar regions are named the Northern sea. And, lastly,\r\nthe Indian ocean, which extends from the eastern shores of Africa along\r\nthe southern coasts of Asia, and has the same general width with the\r\npreceding one.\r\n\r\nAmong the chief of those less expansive sheets of water, properly called\r\nseas, may be mentioned the Baltic, the Mediterranean sea, and the Black\r\nand Red seas. The Caspian sea, being entirely encompassed by land,\r\nmight, with more propriety, have been styled a lake; but as its water\r\npossesses the quality of saltness, it is ranked among the seas. It is,\r\nnotwithstanding, certain that Lake Superior has a still greater\r\ncircumference, extending around its shores at least fourteen hundred\r\nmiles, while the extent of the Caspian does not exceed twelve hundred.\r\n\r\nOf the origin of this division into different seas, and seas of\r\ndifferent depths, little is known; but it is highly probable that many\r\nof the larger excavations and partitions now met with, have existed,\r\nwithout much change as to their extent, from the creation. Others have\r\nundoubtedly been the result of that conflict which is perpetually taking\r\nplace between the elements of land and water, and which has, for the\r\ngreater part, given rise to islands, isthmuses and peninsulas; while\r\nsubterraneous volcanoes, and the truly surprising and indefatigable\r\nexertions of coral, madrepores, tubipores, and other restless and\r\nmultitudinous zoöphytes, have laid, and are daily laying, the foundation\r\nof new islands and continents in the middle of the widest and deepest\r\nseas.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of water in the ocean, not only remains constantly the\r\nsame, but, notwithstanding its most violent and incessant motion,\r\ncontinues stable within certain limits. This, however, can not be\r\ninferred from observation; for, although in the almost infinite variety\r\nof disturbances to which the ocean is liable, from the action of\r\nirregular causes, it may appear to return to its former state of\r\nequilibrium, still it may be apprehended that some extraordinary cause\r\nmay communicate to it a shock, which, though inconsiderable at first,\r\nmay augment continually, and elevate it above the highest mountains. It\r\nis, therefore, interesting to investigate the conditions which are\r\nnecessary for the absolute stability of the ocean. This has been\r\neffected by the celebrated Laplace, who has demonstrated that the\r\nequilibrium of the ocean _must_ be stable, if the density be _less_ than\r\nthe mean density of the earth, which is known to be the case. He has\r\nlikewise determined, by means of his refined analysis, that this\r\nstability would cease to exist, if the mean density of the sea _were to\r\nexceed_ that of the earth; so that the stability of the equilibrium of\r\nthe ocean, and the excess of the density of the terrestrial globe above\r\nthat of the waters which cover it, are reciprocally connected with each\r\nother, and indicate infinite wisdom and contrivance in such an\r\nadjustment.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          SALTNESS OF THE SEA.\r\n\r\nOf the various phenomena of the sea, that of its _saltness_ is one of\r\nthe most obvious. No questions concerning the natural history of our\r\nglobe have been discussed with more attention, or decided with less\r\nsatisfaction, than that concerning its primary cause, which had\r\nperplexed the philosophers before the time of Aristotle, and surpassed\r\neven the great genius of that profound inquirer into natural causes.\r\nKircher, after having consulted not less than thirty-three authors on\r\nthis subject, could not help remarking, that the fluctuations of the\r\nocean itself were scarcely more various than the opinions concerning the\r\norigin of its saline impregnation.\r\n\r\nThis question does not seem capable of admitting an illustration from\r\nexperiment; at least, not from any experiments hitherto made for that\r\npurpose: it is, therefore, not surprising, that it remains nearly as\r\nproblematical in the present age, as it has been in any of the\r\npreceding. Had observations been made three or four centuries ago, to\r\nascertain the saltness of the sea, then, at any particular time and\r\nplace, we might now, by making similar observations at the same place,\r\nin the same season, have been able to know, whether the saltness, at\r\nthat particular place, was increasing or decreasing, or an invariable\r\nquantity. This kind and degree of knowledge would have served as a clue\r\nto direct us to a full investigation of this matter in general. It is to\r\nbe regretted, however, that observations of this nature have not, in\r\nformer days, been made with any degree of precision.\r\n\r\nOne of the principal opinions maintained on this subject by modern\r\nphilosophers, and more particularly supported by Halley, is, that since\r\nriver-water, in almost every part of the globe, is impregnated in a\r\ngreater or less degree by sea-salt, the sea must have gradually acquired\r\nits present quantity of salt from the long continued influx of rivers.\r\nThe water which is carried into the sea by these rivers, is again\r\nseparated from it by evaporation, and being dispersed over the\r\natmosphere by winds, soon descends in rain or vapor upon the surface of\r\nthe earth, whence it hastens to pour into the bosom of the ocean the\r\nfresh tribute of salt it has collected in its inland progress. Thus the\r\nsalt conveyed into the sea not being a volatile substance, nor\r\nperforming an incessant circulation, must be a perpetually increasing\r\nquantity; and sufficient time, it is contended, has elapsed since the\r\ncreation, for the sea to acquire, from this source, its present quantity\r\nof salt.\r\n\r\nThis opinion has been successfully combated; and it is denied that\r\nfreshwater rivers could, in the course of thousands or even millions of\r\nyears, have produced saltness in the sea. If this were the case, every\r\nsea, or great body of water, which receives rivers, must have been salt,\r\nand have possessed a degree of saltness in proportion to the quantity of\r\nwater which these rivers discharge. But so far is this from being true,\r\nthat the Palus Mæotis, and our great American lakes, do not contain salt\r\nwater, but fresh. It may indeed be objected, that the quantity of salt\r\nwhich rivers carry along with them, and deposit in the sea, must depend\r\non the nature of the soil through which they flow, which may in some\r\nplaces not contain any salt; and that this is the reason why the great\r\nlakes in America and the Palus Mæotis are fresh. But to this opinion,\r\nwhich is merely hypothetical, there are insurmountable objections. It is\r\na curious fact, that the saltness of the sea is greatest under the\r\nequator, and diminishes gradually toward the poles; but it can not\r\ntherefore be assumed that the earth contains more salt in the tropical\r\nregions than in the temperate zones, and more in these again than in the\r\nfrigid zones. On the other hand, if it be allowed that the sea receives\r\nits saltness from the rivers, it must be equally salt, or nearly so, in\r\nevery part of the earth; since, according to a simple and well-known\r\nprinciple in chemistry, _when any substance is dissolved in water with\r\nthe assistance of agitation, at whatever part of the water it is\r\nintroduced, it will be equally diffused through the whole liquid_. Now,\r\nthough it were true that a greater quantity of salt should have been\r\nintroduced into the sea under the equator, than toward the poles, from\r\nthe constant agitation occasioned by the wind and tide, the salt must\r\nhave soon pervaded the whole mass of water. Neither is this greater\r\nproportion of saltness owing to a superior degree of heat, since it is\r\nan established principle in chemistry, that cold water and hot water\r\ndissolve nearly the same proportion of salt.\r\n\r\nThe saltness of the sea has also been ascribed to the solution of\r\nsubterraneous mines of salt, that are supposed to abound in the bottom\r\nof the sea, and along its shores. But this hypothesis can not be\r\nsupported. If the sea were constantly dissolving salt, it would soon\r\nbecome saturated; for it can not be said that it is deprived of any\r\nportion of its salt by evaporation, since rain-water is fresh. If the\r\nsea were to become saturated, neither fishes nor vegetables could live\r\nin it. It may hence be inferred that the saltness of the sea can not be\r\naccounted for by secondary causes, and _that it has been salt since the\r\nbeginning of time_. It is indeed impossible to suppose that the waters\r\nof the sea were at any time fresh since the formation of fishes and\r\nsea-plants; neither will they live in water which is fresh. It may hence\r\nbe concluded that the saltness of the sea has, with some few exceptions,\r\nperhaps arising from mines of rock-salt dispersed near its shores, been\r\nnearly the same in all ages. This hypothesis, which is the simplest, and\r\nis involved in the fewest difficulties, best explains the various\r\nphenomena dependent on the saltness of the sea.\r\n\r\nAlthough this saline property may be one of the causes by which the\r\nwaters of the sea are preserved from putridity, still it can not be\r\nconsidered as the principal cause. The ocean has, like rivers, its\r\ncurrents, by which its contents are circulated round the globe; and\r\nthese may be said to be the great agents which keep it sweet and\r\nwholesome. A very enlightened navigator, Sir John Hawkins, speaks of a\r\ncalm, in which the sea, having continued for some time without motion,\r\nassumed a very formidable aspect. “Were it not,” he observes, “for the\r\nmoving of the sea by the force of winds, tides and currents, it would\r\ncorrupt all the world. The experiment of this I saw in the year 1590,\r\nlying with a fleet about the islands of the Azores, almost six months,\r\nthe greater part of which time we were becalmed. Upon which, all the sea\r\nbecame so replenished with various sorts of gellies, and forms of\r\nserpents, adders and snakes, as seemed wonderful; some green, some\r\nblack, some yellow, some white, some of divers colors, and many of them\r\nhad life; and some there were a yard and a half, and two yards long;\r\nwhich, had I not seen, I could hardly have believed. And hereof are\r\nwitnesses all the companies of the ships which were then present; so\r\nthat hardly a man could draw a bucket of water clear of some corruption.\r\nIn which voyage, toward the end thereof, many of every ship fell sick,\r\nand began to die apace. But the speedy passage into our country, was a\r\nremedy to the diseased, and a preservative to those who were not\r\ntouched.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                       CONGELATION OF SEA-WATER.\r\n\r\nAlthough the assertion that salt water never freezes, has been\r\ncontradicted by repeated experience, it is still certain that it\r\nrequires a much greater degree of cold to produce its congelation, than\r\nfresh water. It is, therefore, one of the greatest blessings which we\r\nderive from this element, that when we find all the stores of nature\r\nlocked up to us on the land, the sea is, with few exceptions, ever open\r\nto our necessities. It is well known that at particular seasons, the\r\nmouth of the river St. Lawrence, the entrance into the Baltic sea, &c.,\r\nare so much frozen over as to be impassable by ships; while the vast\r\nmountains and fields of ice in the polar regions, have for ages past\r\nbeen insurmountable obstructions to the daring researches of modern\r\nnavigators. These exceptions, however, will appear of comparatively\r\ntrifling importance to navigation, when the number of ports which are,\r\nin almost every region, open at all seasons of the year, are considered;\r\nand this facility of intercourse would certainly not have been afforded,\r\nif sea-water had admitted of as easy a congelation as that of water not\r\nimpregnated with salt.\r\n\r\nOn the origin of ice in the frozen seas, different opinions have been\r\nentertained. The authority of Capt. Cook and Lord Mulgrave, has been\r\ncited by Bishop Watson, to show that good fresh water may be procured\r\nfrom ice found in those seas; but he observes that, notwithstanding the\r\ntestimonies of these very able navigators, it may still be doubted\r\nwhether the ice from which the water was obtained, had been formed in\r\nthe sea, and, consequently, whether sea-water itself would, when frozen,\r\nyield fresh water. He thinks it probable that the ice had either been\r\nformed at the mouths of large fresh-water rivers, and had thence, by\r\ntides or torrents been drifted into the sea, or that it had been broken\r\nby its own weight, from the immense cliffs of ice and frozen snow which,\r\nin countries where there are few rivers, are found in high latitudes to\r\nproject a great way into the sea. An early navigator, Fotherbye, in the\r\nrelation of his voyage toward the south pole, in 1614, considers snow to\r\nbe the original cause of the ice found at sea, he himself having\r\nobserved it to lie an inch thick on the surface; and Captain Cook, from\r\nhis own observation in the South sea, was disposed to think that the\r\nvast floats of ice he met with in the spring, were formed from the\r\ncongelation of snow. It is certain that the snow which falls upon the\r\nsurface of the sea, being in a solid state, and, bulk for bulk, lighter\r\nthan sea-water, will not readily combine with it, but may, by a due\r\ndegree of cold in the atmosphere, be speedily converted into a layer of\r\nice. The upper layer of this first surface of ice being elevated above\r\nthe surface of the sea, will receive all the fresh water which falls\r\nfrom the atmosphere in the form of snow, sleet, rain or dew, by the\r\nsuccessive congelation of which, the largest fields of ice may at length\r\nbe formed.\r\n\r\nIt is a matter of little consequence to a navigator, whence the ice\r\nwhich supplies him with fresh water is produced. Leaving, therefore,\r\nthese hypotheses relative to the formation of ice in frozen seas, it\r\nshould be observed that the question, whether congealed sea-water will,\r\nwhen thawed, yield fresh water, has been satisfactorily decided by\r\nexperiments made with every suitable attention. A quantity of sea-water\r\nhaving been taken up off the English coast, was exposed to a freezing\r\natmosphere, and afforded an ice perfectly free from any taste of salt;\r\nand it has likewise been found, that not only sea-water, but water\r\ncontaining double the proportion of salt commonly found in our\r\nsea-water, and more than is contained in the sea-water of any climate,\r\nmay be frozen by the cold prevailing in our atmosphere.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ICEBERGS, OR ICE-ISLANDS.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                              ICE-ISLANDS.\r\n\r\nIce-islands, or icebergs, as they are commonly called, is the name given\r\nby seamen to the huge, solid masses of ice which abound in the sea near\r\nor within the polar circles, and which often float down nearer to the\r\nequator, till they are gradually dissolved by the increasing warmth of\r\nthe air and water. The cut gives a view of them as seen by Dr. Scoresby,\r\nwho counted five hundred of them between latitude sixty-nine degrees and\r\nseventy degrees north, which were from one hundred to two hundred feet\r\nhigh, and from a few yards to a mile in circumference. Many of these\r\nfluctuating islands are met with on the coasts of Spitzbergen, to the\r\ngreat danger of the vessels employed in the Greenland fishery. In the\r\nmidst of these tremendous masses, navigators have been arrested and\r\nfrozen to death. In this manner the brave Sir Hugh Willoughby perished,\r\nwith all his crew, in 1553; and in the year 1773, Lord Mulgrave, after\r\nevery effort which the most accomplished seaman could make, to reach the\r\ntermination of his voyage, was caught in the ice, and nearly experienced\r\nthe same unhappy fate. The scene he describes, divested of the horrors\r\nattendant on the eventful expectation of change, was most beautiful and\r\npicturesque. Two large ships becalmed in a vast basin, surrounded on all\r\nsides by ice-islands of various forms; the weather clear; the sun\r\ngilding the circumambient ice, which was smooth, low, even, and covered\r\nwith snow, except where pools of water, on a portion of the surface,\r\nshot forth new icy crystals, and on the smooth surface of the\r\ncomparatively small space of sea in which they were hemmed. Such is the\r\npicture drawn by our navigator, amid the perils by which lie was\r\nsurrounded.\r\n\r\nAfter fruitless attempts to force their way through the fields of ice,\r\nthe limits of these became at length so contracted, that the ships were\r\nimmovably fixed. The smooth extent of surface was soon lost; the\r\npressure of the pieces of ice, by the violence of the swell, caused them\r\nto pack; and fragment rose upon fragment, until they were in many places\r\nhigher than the main-yard. The movements of the ships were tremendous\r\nand involuntary, in conjunction with the surrounding ice, actuated by\r\nthe currents. The water having shoaled to fourteen fathoms, great\r\napprehensions were entertained, as the grounding of the ice, or of the\r\nships, would have been equally fatal: the force of the ice might have\r\ncrushed them to atoms, or have lifted them out of the water, and have\r\noverset them; or, again, have left them suspended on the summits of the\r\npieces of ice, at a tremendous hight, exposed to the fury of the winds,\r\nor to the risk of being dashed to pieces by the failure of their frozen\r\ndock. An attempt was made to cut a passage through the ice; but after a\r\nperseverance truly worthy of Britons, it proved ineffectual. The\r\ncommander, who was at all times master of himself, directed the boats to\r\nbe made ready to be hauled over the ice, till they should reach\r\nnavigable water, proposing in them to make the voyage to England; but\r\nafter they had thus been drawn over the ice, for three progressive days,\r\na wind having sprung up, the ice separated sufficiently to yield to the\r\npressure of the ships in full sail. After having labored against the\r\nresisting fields of ice, they at length reached the harbor of\r\nSmeerinberg, at the west end of Spitzbergen.\r\n\r\nThe vast islands of floating ice which abound in the high southern\r\nlatitudes, are a proof that they are visited by a much severer degree of\r\ncold than equal latitudes toward the north pole. Captain Cook, in his\r\nsecond voyage, fell in with one of these islands in latitude fifty\r\ndegrees, forty minutes, south. It was about fifty feet high, and half a\r\nmile in circuit, being flat on the top, while its sides, against which\r\nthe sea broke exceedingly high, rose in a perpendicular direction. In\r\nthe afternoon of the same day, the tenth of December, 1773, he fell in\r\nwith another large cubical mass of ice, about two thousand feet in\r\nlength, four hundred feet in breadth, and in hight two hundred feet. Mr.\r\nFoster, the naturalist of the voyage, remarks that, according to the\r\nexperiments of Boyle and Marian, the volume of ice is to that of\r\nsea-water as ten to nine: consequently, by the known rules of\r\nhydrostatics, the volume of ice which rises above the surface of the\r\nwater, is to that which sinks below it as one to nine. Supposing,\r\ntherefore, this mass of ice to have been of a regular figure, its depth\r\nunder water must have been eighteen hundred feet, and its whole hight,\r\ntwenty hundred feet: estimating its length, as above, at twenty hundred\r\nfeet, and its breadth at four hundred feet, the entire mass must have\r\ncontained sixteen hundred millions of cubic feet of ice.\r\n\r\nTwo days after, several other ice-islands were seen, some of them nearly\r\ntwo miles in circuit, and six hundred feet high; and yet such was the\r\nforce of the waves, that the sea broke quite over them. They exhibited\r\nfor a few moments a view very pleasing to the eye; but a sense of danger\r\nsoon filled the mind with horror; for had the ship struck against the\r\nweather-side of one of these islands, when the sea ran high, she must in\r\nan instant have been dashed to pieces. The route to the southward was\r\nafterward impeded by an immense field of low ice, the termination of\r\nwhich could not be seen, either to the east, west or south. In different\r\nparts of this field were islands, or hills of ice, like those which had\r\nbefore been found floating in the sea.\r\n\r\nAt length these ice-islands became as familiar to those on board as the\r\nclouds and the sea. Whenever a strong reflection of white was seen on\r\nthe skirts of the sky, near the horizon, then ice was sure to be\r\nencountered; notwithstanding which, that substance itself was not\r\nentirely white, but often tinged, especially near the surface of the\r\nsea, with a most beautiful sapphirine, or rather berylline blue,\r\nevidently reflected from the water. This blue color sometimes appeared\r\ntwenty or thirty feet above the surface, and was probably produced by\r\nparticles of sea-water which had been dashed against the mass in\r\ntempestuous weather, and had penetrated into its interstices. In the\r\nevening, the sun setting just behind one of these masses, tinged its\r\nedges with gold, and reflected on the entire mass a beautiful suffusion\r\nof purple. In the larger masses, were frequently observed shades or\r\ncasts of white, lying above each other in strata, sometimes of six\r\ninches, and at other times of a foot in hight. This appearance seemed to\r\nconfirm the opinion entertained relative to the increase and\r\naccumulation of such huge masses of ice, by heavy falls of snow at\r\ndifferent intervals; for snow being of various kinds, small-grained,\r\nlarge-grained, in light feathery locks, &c., the various degrees of its\r\ncompactness may account for the different colors of the strata.\r\n\r\nIn his third attempt to proceed southward, in January, 1774, Capt. Cook\r\nwas led, by the mildest sunshine which was, perhaps, ever experienced in\r\nthe frigid zone, to entertain hopes of penetrating as far toward the\r\nsouth pole as other navigators have done toward the north pole; but on\r\nthe twenty-sixth of that month, at four in the morning, his officers\r\ndiscovered a solid ice-field of immense extent before them, bearing from\r\neast to west. A bed of fragments floated around this field, which was\r\nraised several feet above the surface of the water. While in this\r\nsituation, the southern part of the horizon was illuminated by the rays\r\nof light reflected from the ice, to a considerable hight. Ninety-seven\r\nice-islands were distinctly seen within the field, besides those on the\r\noutside; many of them very large, and looking like a ridge of mountains,\r\nrising one above the other until they were lost in the clouds. The most\r\nelevated and most ragged of these ice-islands, were surmounted by peaks,\r\nand were from two to three hundred feet in hight, with perpendicular\r\ncliffs or sides astonishing to behold. The largest of them terminated in\r\na peak not unlike the cupola of St. Paul’s.\r\n\r\nThe outer, or northern edge of this immense field of ice, was composed\r\nof loose or broken ice, closely packed together, so that it was not\r\npossible to find any entrance. Such mountains of ice, Captain Cook was\r\npersuaded, were never seen in the Greenland seas, so that no comparison\r\ncould be drawn; and it was the opinion of most of the persons on board,\r\nthat this ice extended quite to the pole, from which they were then less\r\nthan nineteen degrees; or, perhaps, that it was joined to some land to\r\nwhich it had been fixed from the earliest time. Our navigator was of\r\nopinion that it is to the south of this parallel that all the ice is\r\nformed which is found scattered up and down to the northward, and\r\nafterward broken off by gales of wind, or other causes, and brought\r\nforward by the currents which are always found to set in that direction\r\nin high latitudes. “Should there,” he observes, “be land to the south\r\nbehind this ice, it can afford no better retreat for birds, or any other\r\nanimals, than the ice itself, with which it must be wholly covered. I,\r\nwho was ambitious, not only to go further than any one had been before,\r\nbut as far as it was possible for man to go, was not sorry at meeting\r\nwith this interruption; as it in some measure relieved us, or at least\r\nshortened the dangers and hardships inseparable from the navigation of\r\nthe southern polar regions.”\r\n\r\nThe approximation of several fields of ice of different magnitudes,\r\nproduces a very singular phenomenon. The smaller of these masses are\r\nforced out of the water, and thrown on the larger ones, until at length\r\nan aggregate is formed of a tremendous hight. These accumulated bodies\r\nof ice float in the sea like so many rugged mountains, and are\r\ncontinually increased in hight by the freezing of the spray of the sea,\r\nand the melting and then freezing of the snow which falls on them. While\r\ntheir growth is thus augmented, the smaller fields, of a less elevation,\r\nare the meadows of the seals, on which these animals at times frolic by\r\nhundreds.\r\n\r\nThe collision of great fields of ice, in high latitudes, is often\r\nattended by a noise, which, for a time, takes away the sense of hearing\r\nanything beside; and that of the smaller fields, with a grinding of\r\nunspeakable horror. The water which dashes against the mountainous ice,\r\nfreezes into an infinite variety of forms, and presents to the admiring\r\nview of the voyager ideal towns, streets, churches, steeples, and almost\r\nevery form which imagination can picture to itself.\r\n\r\nAfter such notices of the ice-islands from the earlier voyagers, it may\r\nbe interesting to know how they have appeared to later beholders; and\r\nthis may be seen in the following account from the journal of a seaman\r\nwho was in the well known “Arctic Expedition,” in 1850-51. Under the\r\ndate of the thirtieth of June, 1850, he writes: “Moored to an iceberg;\r\nweather calm; sky cloudless, and ‘beautifully blue;’ surrounded by a\r\nvast number of stupendous bergs, glittering and glistening beneath the\r\nrefulgent rays of a midday sun. A great portion of the crew had gone on\r\nshore to gather the eggs of the wild sea-birds that frequent the lonely\r\nice-bound precipices of Baffin’s bay, while those on board had retired\r\nto rest, wearied with the harassing toils of the preceding day. To me,\r\nwalking the deck and alone, all nature seemed hushed in universal\r\nrepose. Whilst thus contemplating the stillness of the monotonous scene\r\naround me, I observed in the offing a large iceberg, completely\r\nperforated, exhibiting in the distance an arch, or tunnel, apparently so\r\nuniform in its conformation, that I was induced to call two of the\r\nseamen to look at it, at the same time telling them, that I had never\r\nread or heard of any of our arctic voyagers passing through one of these\r\narches, so frequently seen through large bergs, and that there would be\r\na novelty in doing so; and if they chose to accompany me, I would get\r\npermission to take the small boat, and endeavor to accomplish the\r\nunprecedented feat.\r\n\r\n“They readily agreed, and away we went. On nearing the arch, and\r\nascertaining that there was a sufficiency of water for the boat to pass\r\nthrough, we rowed slowly and silently under, when there burst upon our\r\nview one of the most magnificent specimens of nature’s handiwork ever\r\nexhibited to mortal eyes; the sublimity and grandeur of which no\r\nlanguage can describe, no imagination conceive. Fancy an immense arch of\r\neighty feet span, fifty feet high, and upward of one hundred feet in\r\nbreadth, as correct in its conformation as if it had been constructed by\r\nthe most scientific artist, formed of solid ice, of a beautiful emerald\r\ngreen, its whole expanse of surface smoother than the most polished\r\nalabaster, and you may form some slight conception of the architectural\r\nbeauties of this icy temple, the wonderful workmanship of time and the\r\nelements. When we had got about half-way through the mighty structure,\r\non looking upward, I observed that the berg was rent the whole breadth\r\nof the arch, and in a perpendicular direction to its summit, showing two\r\nvertical sections of irregular surfaces, ‘darkly, deeply, beautifully\r\nblue,’ here and there illuminated by an arctic sun, which darted its\r\ngolden rays between, presenting to the eye a picture of ethereal\r\ngrandeur, which no poet could describe, no painter portray. I was so\r\nenraptured with the sight, that for a moment I fancied the ‘blue vault\r\nof heaven’ had opened, and that I actually gazed upon the celestial\r\nsplendor of a world beyond this. But, alas! in an instant the scene\r\nchanged, and I awoke as it were from a delightful dream, to experience\r\nall the horrors of a terrible reality. I observed the fracture rapidly\r\nclose, then again slowly open. This stupendous mass of ice, millions of\r\ntuns in weight, was afloat, consequently in motion, and apparently about\r\nto lose its equilibrium, capsize, or burst into fragments.\r\n\r\n“Our position was truly awful. My feelings at the moment may be\r\nconceived, but can not be described. I looked downward and around me;\r\nthe sight was equally appalling; the very sea seemed agitated. I at last\r\nshut my eyes from a scene so terrible, the men at the oars, as if by\r\ninstinct, ‘gave way,’ and our little craft swiftly glided from beneath\r\nthe gigantic mass. We then rowed round the berg, keeping at a respectful\r\ndistance from it, in order to judge of its magnitude. I supposed it to\r\nbe about a mile in circumference, and its highest pinnacle two hundred\r\nand fifty feet. Thus ended an excursion, the bare recollection of which,\r\nat this moment, awakens in me a shudder; nevertheless, I would not have\r\nlost the opportunity of witnessing a scene so awfully sublime, so\r\ntragically grand, for thousands of pounds, but I would not again run\r\nsuch a risk for a world. We passed through the berg about two P. M., and\r\nat ten o’clock the same night, it burst, agitating the sea for miles\r\naround. I may also observe, that the two men who were with me in the\r\nboat, did not observe that the berg was rent until I told them, after we\r\nwere out of danger, we having agreed, previously to entering the arch,\r\nnot to speak a word to each other, lest echo itself should disturb the\r\nfragile mass.”\r\n\r\nAs further describing the appearances of icebergs, we give the following\r\nnarrative by Mr. Abbott, who himself was a witness of the splendid\r\nscenery he so graphically describes. He says: “The trip of the Baltic,\r\nin March, 1854, is likely to be somewhat memorable. We left Sandy Hook,\r\non Sunday morning, the fifth, and had a propitious and rapid run, until\r\nFriday the tenth, about three o’clock. When in latitude forty-six\r\ndegrees and longitude forty-eight degrees, our attention was arrested by\r\nsome small pieces of broken ice, floating in every direction around us.\r\nThe weather was thick and hazy, so that we could nowhere see the\r\nhorizon. In the course of an hour or two, the fog partly disappeared,\r\nand we found ourselves nearly half-surrounded by an immense field of\r\ndrift-ice, and large numbers of icebergs, extending from north-east by\r\nsouth to south-west.\r\n\r\n“Our speed was immediately slackened, and the course of the ship changed\r\nto the northward and westward. It soon appeared that we were completely\r\nhemmed in on every side, by immense fields of floating drift, sometimes\r\nin loose and broken masses, sometimes in a compact and immovable jam,\r\nand everywhere studded with vast and towering icebergs, of almost every\r\nconceivable form and size.\r\n\r\n“The fog gradually lifted, now in one direction, and now in another,\r\njust sufficient to discover to us, that we were fairly surrounded, and\r\nthat, to whatever point of the compass we could turn the eye or the\r\nship, interminable masses of drift-ice, of uplift, and icebergs, seemed\r\nto cover the sea. So sudden and unexpected was this discovery, that it\r\nseemed more like fairy work than reality. Surprise and astonishment, at\r\nthe novel and wonderful scene around us, seemed at first to make us all\r\nunconscious of our own critical situation. Separating from it the idea\r\nof danger, it would be difficult to imagine a scene combining and\r\nblending more of the elements of beauty, grandeur and sublimity. Far as\r\nthe eye could reach, it was no longer sea and sky, but ice, ice, ice,\r\nfloating like an archipelago of a thousand isles, great and small, of\r\nhighland and lowland, mountain, peninsula, promontory, and Gibraltar\r\nrock.\r\n\r\n“Running in countless directions through these masses, the ocean waves\r\nappeared in narrow but doubly dark currents, forming the most crooked\r\nand irregular passages, of rivulet and river, and endless indentations\r\nof inlet and bay. Through these labyrinthine passages, perpetually\r\nopening and closing by the action of winds and waves, our escape was to\r\nbe made. Once, in attempting to force a passage through a long but\r\nnarrow neck of broken blocks of ice, which had drifted across our way,\r\nthe cutwater, bows and wheels of the ship, were pretty seriously\r\nbattered.\r\n\r\n“All night long the ship was kept running slowly, threading her way\r\nthrough these little passages of clear water, until four o’clock in the\r\nmorning, when she was so pressed on every side, with sheets of ice,\r\ncrowded and packed far above the surface of the water, and urged on by\r\nthe momentum of vast masses of iceberg, that prudence required to stop\r\nthe engine and wait for daylight. The morning brought little cheering\r\nprospect. The man at mast-head reported no clear water, as far as the\r\neye could reach, excepting in narrow and scarcely navigable patches and\r\nveins. The surface of the sea all around the horizon, seemed an almost\r\nunbroken plain of field and mountain ice. As early as light allowed, the\r\nship was again under way for the largest space of clear water that could\r\nbe seen, and continued all day long to retrace her path to the westward,\r\nveering her course, however, through every point of the compass, to find\r\nthe intricate passages toward the open sea. The wind, fresh from the\r\nnorth-west, came with intense and piercing cold. The man at the\r\nmast-head could not stand its severity more than half an hour. The\r\nmasts, shrouds and cordage of the ship, were completely incrusted, and\r\naltogether what with field-ice, drift, and icebergs, snow, rain and\r\nhail, gale and storm, these days in the ice will not soon be forgotten.\r\n\r\n“The different aspects of these scenes by day and night furnished an\r\nincessant source of interest. The vast fields of drift, in their varied\r\nforms, by daylight and by moonlight, were picturesque and beautiful in\r\nthe highest degree. They ranged in extent from a quarter of a mile, to\r\nperhaps ten miles square. In some cases, the entire field seemed to be\r\ncomposed of small broken fragments, floating in close proximity to each\r\nother, yet yielding readily to the play of the waves, rising and falling\r\nwith the swell of the sea. The superincumbent weight upon the surface of\r\nthe water, diminished the elevation of the waves, but the reflected\r\nlight from its uneven silver surface, revealed far more distinctly and\r\nbeautifully, the extent of motion and the action of the waves. The long\r\nswells of the sea stretched away in graceful curves for miles,\r\nresembling more than anything else I can suggest, some of the rolling\r\nprairies of the west, as they must appear in snow, with this difference,\r\nthat the swells seemed ‘all alive,’ as if some mighty monsters of the\r\ndeep were working their way beneath, perpetually shifting their\r\nposition, and vainly endeavoring to lift the load that covers them, to\r\nfind a breathing in the open air. In other instances, these vast fields,\r\nstretching as far as the eye could reach over half the visible horizon,\r\nwere one compact and apparently motionless mass of solid ice, as fixed\r\nas a ‘rock-bound coast.’\r\n\r\n“Another form of peculiar interest was that of a wide field, of many\r\nmiles in extent, apparently formed by a long succession of ‘uplifts.’\r\nThe action of the waves had gradually forced large blocks of ice beneath\r\none edge, and the long continuation of this process, had lifted as it\r\nwould seem, almost the entire mass, many feet out of water. The outer\r\nedge of these uplifts presented an abrupt and perpendicular wall. In one\r\ncase, at night, the captain estimated that he had sailed for ten miles,\r\nalong such a wall, the hight of the wheel-house, about forty feet. A\r\nvery beautiful effect was once produced by a small mass of this kind. It\r\nwas several miles distant, and of very considerable length. As it rolled\r\nand pitched, one side, apparently fifteen or twenty feet high, dipped in\r\nthe waves, and rising again, lifted an immense volume of water, which\r\nthen ran off, in a beautiful and magnificent torrent, over the rising\r\nedge. I watched with my glass for an hour, the graceful evolutions of\r\nthis interesting cataract, which is probably still performing, by its\r\nregular rise and fall, a very respectable, but intermittent Niagara, in\r\nthe middle of the Atlantic, with all the regularity of a pendulum.\r\n\r\n“The icebergs, themselves, which we saw, were very numerous, and of\r\nalmost every conceivable form and size. During our passage through three\r\nhundred miles, the number we observed was variously estimated from five\r\nhundred to one thousand. I counted at one time thirty-six, and at\r\nanother forty-five, all of notable magnitude. They sometimes were of\r\nmost curious and fantastic shapes. Hill and mountain of every imaginable\r\noutline, castle and tower, turret, and out-jutting and overhanging\r\ncrags, magnificent needle forms shooting to the sky, like the spire of\r\nTrinity, crouching lions, and polar bears, trees of ice, and natural\r\nbridges, in short, you can scarcely fancy anything odd, that snow and\r\nice can be made to resemble, that had not its type around us.\r\n\r\n“But, perhaps, the most wonderful of all, was the great ‘plunging\r\niceberg.’ It was a round, oblong mass of ice, estimated by careful\r\ncomparison with our wheel-house, to be fifty by seventy-five feet. A\r\nside view made it appear about as large as the front of a large, double,\r\nfour story dwelling. But it was as true and perfect an oval, as the most\r\nexquisitely beautiful bald head you have ever seen. It looked exactly\r\nlike the upper part of a head of some gigantic being. This, as it\r\nfloated past us, gradually descended in the waves, until it sunk beneath\r\nthe surface. It then rose with a most majestic movement, lifting the\r\npure white crown, to the hight of fifty feet. It presented on the whole,\r\none of the grandest sights I ever beheld. It continued thus sinking and\r\nrising till it was out of our sight. It seemed like a creature of life,\r\npaying its respects to our noble ship.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                               ICEBERGS.\r\n\r\nAnalogous to the ice-fields described above, are those large bodies of\r\nice, perhaps more properly named icebergs, which fill the valleys\r\nbetween the high mountains in northern latitudes. Among the most\r\nremarkable, are those of the east coast of Spitzbergen. They are seven\r\nin number, and lie at considerable distances from each other, extending\r\nthrough tracts unknown, in a region totally inaccessible in the internal\r\nparts. The most distant of them exhibits over the sea a front three\r\nhundred feet in hight, emulating the color of the emerald; cataracts of\r\nmelted snow fall down in various parts; and black, spiral mountains,\r\nstreaked with white, bound the sides, rising crag above crag, as far as\r\nthe eye can reach in the background. At times immense fragments break\r\noff, and precipitate themselves into the water with a most alarming\r\ndashing. A portion of this vivid green substance was seen by Lord\r\nMulgrave, in the voyage above referred to, to fall into the sea; and,\r\nnotwithstanding it grounded in twenty-four fathoms of water, it spired\r\nabove the surface fifty feet. Similar icebergs are frequent in all the\r\narctic regions; and to their fall is owing the solid mountainous ice\r\nwhich infests those seas.\r\n\r\nThe frost sports wonderfully with these icebergs, and gives them\r\nmajestic, as well as other most singular forms. Masses have been seen to\r\nassume the shape of a Gothic church, with arches, windows and doors, and\r\nall the rich drapery of that style of architecture, composed of what the\r\nwriter of an Arabian tale would scarcely have ventured to introduce\r\namong the marvelous suggestions of his fancy, _crystals of the richest\r\nsapphirine blue_. Tables with one or more feet; and often immense\r\nflat-roofed temples, like those of Luxor, on the bank of the Nile,\r\nsupported by round transparent columns of cerulean hue, float by the\r\nastonished spectator. These icebergs are the creation of ages, and\r\nacquire annually additional hight by falls of snow and rain, which\r\nlatter often freezes instantly, and more than repairs the loss\r\noccasioned by the influence of the sun’s heat.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      LUMINOUS POINTS IN THE SEA.\r\n\r\nAmong the phenomena which have long exercised the sagacity of\r\nphilosophers, that of the luminous appearance of the surface of the sea,\r\nduring the obscurity of the night, is highly curious. A variety of\r\nexperiments were made by a French naturalist at Cayenne, at different\r\nseasons, to ascertain its true cause; and to him it appeared that these\r\nluminous points were produced by motion and friction alone, as he could\r\nnot, with the help of the best glasses, perceive any insects floating in\r\nthe water. But it would seem, from the experiments and observations of\r\nmany learned men, that this phenomenon is produced by various causes,\r\nboth jointly and separately. It has been proved by one set of\r\nexperiments, that the putrefaction of animal substances produces light\r\nand scintillation in the sea. A little white fish placed in seawater\r\nrendered it luminous in the space of twenty-eight hours. On another\r\nhand, it is certain that there is in the sea a prodigious quantity of\r\nshining insects or animalcules, which contribute to this phenomenon. A\r\nFrench astronomer, M. Dangelet, who returned from Terra Australis in\r\n1774, brought with him several kinds of worms which shine in water, when\r\nit is set in motion; and M. Rigaud affirms, that the luminous surface of\r\nthe sea, from Brest to the Antilles, contains a great quantity of\r\nlittle, round, shining polypi, of about a quarter of a line in diameter.\r\nOther learned men, who acknowledge the existence of these luminous\r\nanimals, can not, however, be persuaded to consider them as the cause of\r\nall that light and scintillation which appear on the surface of the\r\nocean. They imagine that some substance of a phosphoric nature, arising\r\nfrom putrefaction, must be admitted as one of the causes of this\r\nphenomenon. By other naturalists it has been ascribed to the oily and\r\ngreasy substances with which the sea is impregnated; in proof of which a\r\nkind of fish, resembling the tunny, is cited, as being provided with an\r\noil which shines with considerable luster.\r\n\r\nThe Abbe Nollent was convinced, by a series of experiments, that this\r\nphenomenon is caused by small animals, either by their luminous aspect,\r\nor by some liquor or effluvium which they emit. He did not, however,\r\nexclude other causes; and among these, the spawn or fry of fishes is\r\ndeserving of attention. M. Dangelet, in sailing into the bay of\r\nAntongil, in the island of Madagascar, observed a prodigious quantity of\r\nfry, which covered the surface of the sea for the extent of more than a\r\nmile, and which he at first, on account of its color, mistook for a bank\r\nof sand. This immense accumulation of spawn or fry exhaled a\r\ndisagreeable odor; and it should be remarked that the sea had, for some\r\ndays before, appeared with uncommon splendor. The same accurate\r\nobserver, perceiving the sea remarkably luminous in the road of the cape\r\nof Good Hope, during a perfect calm, remarked that the oars of the\r\ncanoes produced a whitish and pearly kind of luster: when he took in his\r\nhand the water, which contained phosphorus, he discerned in it, for some\r\nminutes, globules of light as large as the heads of pins. On pressing\r\nthese globules, they appeared to his touch like a soft and thin pulp;\r\nand some days after the sea was covered with entire banks of small\r\nfishes, in innumerable multitudes.\r\n\r\nFrom all these facts it may be deduced, that various causes contribute\r\nto the light and scintillation of the sea; and that the light which the\r\nCayenne naturalist attributed to agitation and friction, differs from\r\nthat which is extended far and near, seeming to cover the whole surface\r\nof the ocean, and producing a very beautiful and striking appearance,\r\nparticularly in the torrid zone, and in the summer season.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          TIDES AND CURRENTS.\r\n\r\nAlternate tides in sacred order run.—BLACKMORE.\r\n\r\nAmong the most wonderful phenomena of nature may be reckoned the tides\r\nof the sea. They were but little understood by the ancients, although\r\nPliny, Ptolemy and Macrobius, were of opinion that they were influenced\r\nby the sun and moon. The former expressly says, that the cause of the\r\nebb and flow is in the sun, which attracts the waters of the ocean; and\r\nhe adds, that the waters rise in proportion to the proximity of the moon\r\nto the earth.\r\n\r\nThe phenomena of the tides have been ascribed to the principle of innate\r\ngravitation; but Sir Richard Phillips, in his theory of the system of\r\nthe universe, refers them to that general law of motion which he\r\nconsiders as the primary and proximate cause of all phenomena,\r\noperating, in a descending series, from the rotation of the sun round\r\nthe fulcrum of the solar system, to the fall of an apple to the earth.\r\nThis motion being transferred through all nature from its source, serves\r\nas the efficient cause of every species of vitality, of every organic\r\narrangement, and of all those accidents of body heretofore ascribed to\r\nattraction.\r\n\r\nThe waters of the ocean are observed to flow and rise twice a day, in\r\nwhich motion, or flux, which in the same direction lasts nearly six\r\nhours, the sea gradually swells, and, entering the mouths of rivers,\r\ndrives back the river-waters toward their head. After a continued flux\r\nof six hours, it seems to repose for a quarter of an hour, and then\r\nbegins to ebb, or retire back, for six hours more; in which time, by the\r\nsubsidence of the waters, the rivers resume their usual course. After a\r\nquarter of an hour, the sea again flows and rises as before.\r\n\r\nAccording to the theory of Newton, these phenomena were supposed to be\r\nproduced by an imaginary power called attraction. The moon was supposed\r\nto attract the waters by the influence of an occult power inherent in\r\nall matter; just as the earth was supposed to attract the moon, the moon\r\nthe earth, and the planets one another. Others, again, ridicule this\r\nidea, as unsustained and visionary, giving in their turn some theory\r\nthat has no better argument to sustain it. And it is probable the time\r\nis yet future when we shall have any theory that will fully account for\r\nall the phenomena of the tides. On account of the shallowness of some\r\nseas, and the narrowness of the straits in others, there arises a great\r\ndiversity in the phenomena, only to be accounted for by an exact\r\nknowledge of the place. For instance, in the English channel and the\r\nGerman ocean, the tide is found to flow strongest in those places that\r\nare narrowest, the same quantity of water being, in this case, driven\r\nthrough a smaller passage. It is often seen, therefore, rushing through\r\na strait with great force, and considerably raised, by its rapidity,\r\nabove that part of the ocean through which it runs.\r\n\r\nThe shallowness and narrowness of many parts of the sea, give rise also\r\nto a peculiarity in the tides of some parts of the world: for in many\r\nplaces, in the British seas in particular, the greatest swell of the\r\ntide is not while the moon is in its meridian hight, and directly over\r\nthe place, but some time after it has declined thence. The sea, in this\r\ncase, being obstructed, pursues the moon with what dispatch it can, but\r\ndoes not arrive with all its waters, until after the moon has ceased to\r\noperate. Lastly, from this shallowness of the sea, and from its being\r\nobstructed by shoals and straits, it happens that the Mediterranean, the\r\nBaltic and the Black sea, have not any sensible tides, to raise or\r\ndepress them in a considerable degree.\r\n\r\nAmong the phenomena of the tides, one of the most singular is the bore,\r\npeculiar to several rivers: it is ascribed to the waters, which were\r\nbefore expansive, being suddenly pent up, and confined within a narrow\r\nspace. This bore or impetuous rush of waters, accompanies the first\r\nflowing of the tide in the Ferret, in Somersetshire, and in the Seine,\r\nin France. It is also one of the peculiarities of the Severn, the most\r\nrapid river in England.\r\n\r\nOne of the greatest known tides is that of the Bristol channel, which\r\nsometimes flows upward of forty feet. At the mouth of the river Indus,\r\nthe water rises thirty feet. The tides also are remarkably high on the\r\ncoasts of Malay, in the straits of Sunda, in the Red sea, at the mouth\r\nof the river St. Lawrence, along the coasts of China and Japan, at\r\nPanama, and in the gulf of Bengal. The most remarkable tides, however,\r\nare those at Batsha, in the kingdom of Tonquin, in twenty degrees, fifty\r\nminutes, north latitude. In that port, the sea ebbs and flows once only\r\nin twenty-four hours, while in all other places there are two tides\r\nwithin that space. What is still more extraordinary, twice in each\r\nmonth, when the moon is near the equinoctial, there is not any tide, the\r\nwater being for some time quite stagnant. These, with other anomalies of\r\nthe tides there, Sir Isaac Newton, with peculiar sagacity, ascertained\r\nto arise from the concurrence of two tides, one from the South sea, and\r\nthe other from the Indian ocean. Of each of these two tides there come\r\nsuccessively two every day; two at one time greater, and two at another\r\nwhich are less. The time between the arrival of the two greater was\r\nconsidered by him as high tide; that between the two less, as ebb. In\r\nshort, with these simple facts in his possession, that great\r\nmathematician solved every appearance, and so established his theory as\r\nto silence every opposer.\r\n\r\nBesides the common and periodical tides, a variety of local currents are\r\nmet with in different seas, on different parts of the ocean, and for the\r\ngreater part at an inconsiderable distance from land. They have been\r\nusually ascribed to particular winds; but their origin is not easy to\r\ntrace, as they have been occasionally found beneath the surface of the\r\nwater, running in a contrary direction to the stratum above, and can\r\nnot, therefore, have been owing to winds or monsoons. These particular\r\ncurrents have been ascribed to the immense masses of polar ice, which\r\nproduce a greater degree of cold in the under than in the upper stratum\r\nof waters; and it has been suspected that there is an under-current of\r\ncold water flowing perpetually from the poles toward the equator, even\r\nwhere the water above flows toward the poles. The great disparity of\r\ntemperature which is frequently found in deep and superficial soundings\r\nof the same space of water, is thus accounted for.\r\n\r\nThe most extraordinary current of this kind, is that of the gulf of\r\nFlorida, usually called the Gulf stream, which sets along the coast of\r\nNorth America to the northward and eastward, and flows with an\r\nuninterrupted rapidity. It is ascribed to the trade-winds, which,\r\nblowing from the eastern quarter into the great Mexican gulf, cause\r\nthere an accumulation above the common level of the sea. The water,\r\ntherefore, constantly runs out by the channel where it finds least\r\nresistance, that is, through the gulf of Florida, with such force as to\r\ncontinue a distinct stream to a very great distance. A proof of its\r\nhaving thus originated is, that the water in the Gulf stream has been\r\nfound to have retained a great portion of the heat it had acquired in\r\nthe torrid zone.\r\n\r\nA very singular upper current often prevails to the westward of Scilly,\r\nand is highly dangerous to ships which approach the British channel.\r\nCurrents of this description are, however more frequently met with about\r\nthe straits of Gibraltar, and near the West India islands, the coasts of\r\nwhich are so subject to counter-tides, or extraordinary currents, that\r\nit is often dangerous for boats to land. They proceed to the westward,\r\nalong the coasts of Yucatan and Mexico, and running round into the gulf,\r\nreturn into the great ocean by the straits of Bahama, along the coasts\r\nof Florida, in order to pursue, in the north, the course ordained them\r\nby the great Author of nature. In this course the waters run with an\r\nextraordinary rapidity, passing on, however, by a motion so even and\r\nimperceptible, that their speed is not realized by the spectator. But\r\nagainst the shores and coasts of the various islands in their way, their\r\nprogress becomes very manifest, and even dangerous, interrupting the\r\nnavigation, and rendering it hardly possible to stem them in their\r\ncourse.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these regular currents, there are others, called\r\ncounter-tides, which are observable on the sea-coasts and shores. In\r\nplaces where these flow, the sea rolls and dashes in an extraordinary\r\nmanner, becoming furious without any apparent cause, and without being\r\nmoved by any wind. The waves rise and open very high, breaking on the\r\nshore with such violence, that it is impossible for vessels to land.\r\nThese counter-tides have been, by some, ascribed to the pressure of the\r\nheavy black wind-clouds which are occasionally seen to hang over an\r\nisland, or over the sea where they occur, though it is far more probable\r\nthat in every case they are caused by under-currents and hidden shoals,\r\nby which the ordinary currents are checked and broken so as to cause the\r\neffects described.\r\n\r\nSomewhat similar to these, at least in its hidden cause, is the\r\ncelebrated Maelstrom on the coast of Norway, a view of which is given in\r\nthe cut. This is caused by the tides, in their violent passage between\r\nthe Loffoden islands; and its terrors, though at all times great, are\r\nsometimes greatly increased by the winds. The roar of the sea, when the\r\nMaelstrom is in full action, is said to be terrific. It is stated that\r\nnot only ships, but even whales, have been sucked into this vortex, and\r\nkilled by being dashed against the hidden rocks. The following\r\ndescription, though imaginary, gives a correct idea of the destruction\r\nof a ship in this whirlpool.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE MAELSTROM.]\r\n\r\n“The breeze, which had been long flagging, now lulled into a calm, and\r\nsoon a low continual hum, like that of an army of bees, which seemed to\r\nrise out of the stilled ocean, became audible to every ear. Not a word\r\nwas spoken; every one held his breath whilst he listened with an\r\nintensity of eagerness that betokened the awe that was fast filling the\r\nheart. ‘It is the Moskoestrom!’ cried the boatswain. ‘The Moskoestrom!’\r\nechoed the crew. ‘Away, men!’ shouted the mate; ‘down to the hold, bring\r\nup the spare sails, clear the deck, set up a spar for a mast; away,\r\naway!’\r\n\r\n“The din of preparation drowned the stern hum of the distant whirlpool:\r\nthere was, however, an anxious pause when the new sail was set into the\r\nair; and experienced sailors suffered themselves to be cheated with the\r\nhope that there was still breeze enough to make the good ship answer her\r\nhelm. But, alas! the heavy canvas refused to expand its folds, and not a\r\nbreath of wind ruffled the dull surface of the sullen waters. They had\r\nnot another hope; the sailors looked on one another with blank dismay,\r\nand now they heard, with awful distinctness, the roar of the terrible\r\nMaelstrom, and the frowning rocks of Loffoden were but too plainly\r\nvisible on the right. It became evident to all, that the ship, borne\r\nalong by the tide, was fast drawing near the dreadful whirlpool. The\r\nvessel continued slowly to approach, and the certainty of unavoidable\r\ndeath became every moment more overpowering and intense. At first the\r\nsailors stood together in a group, gazing gloomily upon one another; but\r\nas the roar of the whirlpool became louder and louder, and the\r\nconviction of inevitable destruction became stronger, they all dispersed\r\nto various parts of the ship. * * *\r\n\r\n“It was a beautiful day; the sun shone forth without a cloud to dim his\r\nluster, the waves sparkled beneath his influence, and the white plumage\r\nof a thousand busy sea-birds became more dazzling with his rays. The\r\nisle of Moskoe was close at hand, and looked cheerful and inviting, but\r\nthe ship was not to approach nearer to its shores; the stream which bore\r\nher along never suffered any vessel to pause in its career. And now\r\nthere arose at some distance ahead of the vessel, a horrible and dismal\r\nbellowing. It was the voice of the leviathan in his agony; and when\r\nthose on deck who had still ears for exterior sounds looked forward to\r\nascertain its cause, they beheld a huge black monster upon the surface\r\nof the sea, struggling against the irresistible stream, and with his\r\nimmense tail lashing the waters into foam, as he vainly strove to escape\r\nfrom destruction. They beheld him borne away by the might of his furious\r\nenemy; and they heard his last roar above the noise of the whirlpool, as\r\nhe was sucked down into the never satisfied abyss, and disappeared from\r\ntheir eyes to be torn to atoms; for such is the fate of everything that\r\nseeks the depths of the Maelstrom.\r\n\r\n“The ship glides along faster and faster; she begins to toss and roll\r\nuneasily in the angry rapids that boil around her; her race is nearly\r\nrun. Terrible! terrible moment! The ship hurries on to her doom with mad\r\nimpetuosity. She is in the rapids! she hurries along swift as a flash of\r\nfire. She is in the whirl of water! round, round, round she goes; her\r\ninmates catch hold of her bulwarks and of each other, to steady\r\nthemselves. And now her bow sprit is under the waves, and a wild shriek\r\nof despair rises into the sky! The whirlpool, with greedy jaws, has\r\nsucked her under.”\r\n\r\nThe water of the whirlpool is said to be two hundred and fifty feet\r\ndeep, and at ebb its noise is as loud as a cataract. In 1645, it was so\r\nviolently agitated by a storm, that in Moskoe the houses were so shaken\r\nas to cause the stones to fall to the ground. Fragments of vessels\r\nwrecked in the Maelstrom are frequently seen on the coast, brought up by\r\nthe return of the tide, their edges mashed and jagged as with a saw,\r\nwhich would induce the belief that the bottom is composed of sharp\r\nrocks.\r\n\r\nSimilar in its cause to the Maelstrom, though on a much inferior scale,\r\nis the current, or whirlpool, called _Hurlgate_ or _Hellgate_, between\r\nthe East river and Long Island sound, near New York. In the narrow\r\nchannel here, the tide flows backward and forward with great force; and\r\nthere being large, irregular rocks in this channel, the water is thrown\r\ninto the most violent agitation. In passing through the place, it is\r\neasy to see the waves seeming to boil as if in a pot. This place is\r\ndangerous to vessels, and many have been wrecked here; though the\r\nnavigation is now so well understood, that fewer accidents happen than\r\nformerly. The steamboats generally pass in safety, but still the superb\r\nOregon got upon the rocks here, within a few years, and came near being\r\nlost.\r\n\r\nBetween Sicily and the main land are the straits of Messina, where the\r\ncurrent is rapid. Ancient mariners deemed this a terrible place; one\r\nside they called Scylla, and the other Charybdis. The poets depicted the\r\nsailor in this rapid, as beset by horrors; for if he escaped Scylla on\r\none side, Charybdis was ready to dash him in pieces on the other. This\r\nidea has come down to our day, and has even passed into a proverb.\r\n\r\n                  ------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n              -------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n                  ------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n                         CATARACTS AND CASCADES\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has often been remarked that no one is insensible to the beauty of\r\nflowing water. When it glides quietly on in a stream, its character is\r\nthat of gentleness, and it suggests only the ideas of calm and tranquil\r\nbeauty. But when it expands to a greater width, and its floods are\r\npoured forth in an impetuous tide, then it assumes the aspect of\r\ngrandeur, and wakens in the beholder the emotions of sublimity.\r\n\r\nThe beauty of running water has, indeed, long been celebrated, and the\r\nriver has often suggested an image illustrative of human life. Even\r\nPliny, who wrote some two thousand years ago, likens a river to the\r\nprogress of man. “Its beginnings,” he says, “are insignificant, and its\r\ninfancy is frivolous; it plays among the flowers of a meadow, it waters\r\na garden, or turns a mill. Gathering strength in its growth, it becomes\r\nwild and impetuous. Impatient of the restraint it meets with in the\r\nhollows of the mountains, it is restless and fretful, quick in its\r\nturnings, and unsteady in its course. Now it is a roaring cataract,\r\ntearing up and overturning whatever opposes its progress, and it shoots\r\nheadlong down a rock; then it becomes a gloomy, sullen pool, buried in\r\nthe bottom of a glen. Recovering breath by repose, it again dashes\r\nalong, till, tired of uproar and mischief, it quits all that it has\r\nswept along, and leaves the opening of the valley strewed with the\r\nrejected waste. Now, quitting its retirement, it comes abroad into the\r\nworld, journeying with more prudence and discretion through cultivated\r\nfields, yielding to circumstances, and winding round what would trouble\r\nit to overwhelm or remove. It passes through the populous cities, and\r\nall the busy haunts of man, tenders its services on every side, and\r\nbecomes the support and ornament of the country. Increased by numerous\r\nalliances, and advanced in its course, it becomes grave and stately in\r\nits motions, loves peace and quiet, and in majestic silence rolls on its\r\nmighty waters, till it is laid to rest in the vast abyss.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                           FALLS OF NIAGARA.\r\n\r\nCataracts or falls are formed by the descent of rivers over rocks, from\r\na higher to a lower level. That of Niagara, is situated on the river\r\nNiagara, between Canada and the United States, which takes its rise in\r\nthe eastern extremity of Lake Erie, and, after flowing for thirty-five\r\nmiles, empties itself into Lake Ontario. Its breadth is nine hundred\r\nfeet, and its depth very considerable; but its current is so exceedingly\r\nstrong and irregular, and its channel so frequently interspersed with\r\nrocks, that it is navigable for small boats only. Proceeding lower, the\r\nstream widens, and the rocks gradually recede from the view, and the\r\ncurrent though strong, is smooth and regular. At Fort Chippewa, however,\r\nsituated one league above the cataracts, the scene is again changed, and\r\nthe river so agitated, that a boat would be inevitably dashed in pieces,\r\nwere it permitted to pass Fort Niagara, situated on its bank. So\r\nimpetuously do the waves break among the rocks, that the mere sight of\r\nthem, from the adjacent shore, is sufficient to strike terror in the\r\nspectator. As it approaches the falls, the stream rushes along, with\r\nredoubled fury, until it reaches the edge of the stupendous precipice,\r\nwhen it tumbles suddenly to the bottom, without meeting with any\r\nobstruction in its descent. Precisely at this place, the river strikes\r\noff to the right, and the line of cataracts winds obliquely across,\r\ninstead of extending, in the shortest direction, from the one bank to\r\nthe other. It ought to be observed, that the water does not precipitate\r\nitself down the vast abyss in one entire sheet, but, being separated by\r\nislands, forms three distinct, collateral falls.\r\n\r\nOne of these is called the great or Horseshoe fall, from the similarity\r\nof its form to that of a horseshoe. It is situated on the north-west\r\nextremity of the river, and is most deserving of the attention of the\r\nspectator, as probably seven-eighths of the water passes over it, and as\r\nits grandeur is evidently superior to that of the adjacent cataracts,\r\nalthough its hight may be somewhat less. As the extent of this fall can\r\nbe ascertained by the eye only, it is impossible precisely to describe\r\nits limits; but its circumference is generally computed at eighteen\r\nhundred feet, somewhat more than one-third of a mile. Beyond the\r\nintervening island, the width of which may be equal to one thousand and\r\nfifty feet, is the second fall, about fifteen feet wide; and at the\r\ndistance of ninety feet, occupied by the second island, is the third\r\nfall, the dimensions of which may be reckoned equal to those of the\r\nlarge island; so that the entire extent of the precipice, including the\r\nintermediate islands, is four thousand and five feet; a computation\r\nwhich certainly does not exceed the truth. The quantity of water\r\nprecipitated from the falls is prodigious, and it has been estimated,\r\namounts to _six hundred and seventy thousand, two hundred and fifty tuns\r\nper minute_.\r\n\r\nFrom the eminence entitled the Table rock, the spectator has a fine\r\nprospect of the terrific rapids above the falls, and of the surrounding\r\nshores, embellished with lofty woods. He there sees to advantage the\r\nadjacent Horseshoe fall, and the dread abyss, into which he may look\r\nperpendicularly from the edge of the rock, if his courage be equal to\r\nhis curiosity. The immensity of the various objects which here present\r\nthemselves to the view, infallibly overwhelms a stranger with\r\nastonishment, and several minutes must elapse before he can possibly\r\ncollect himself sufficiently to form any just conception of the awful\r\nand magnificent scene before him, which requires that all its component\r\nparts should be separately examined, and which affords so truly\r\nsurprising an exhibition, that persons who have resided in its vicinity\r\nfor several years, and who have been constantly habituated to its\r\nsublimity, ingenuously acknowledge, _at their last visit_, that they\r\nwere never able before to discover its peculiar grandeur.\r\n\r\nFrom a cliff nearly opposite to one extremity of the third fall, the\r\nfalls are seen in a very interesting point of view: the scenery there,\r\nit is true, is less magnificent, but is infinitely more beautiful than\r\nfrom any other station. For several miles beneath the precipice the\r\nriver is bounded, on either side, by steep and lofty cliffs, composed of\r\nearth and rocks, which in most parts are perpendicular. The descent to\r\nthe bottom of the falls was formerly accomplished by two ladders, formed\r\nof long pine trees, with notches on their sides, on which the traveler\r\nrested his feet, and passed down amidst a variety of huge misshapen\r\nrocks and pendant trees, seeming to threaten him with instantaneous\r\ndestruction. The breadth of the river in this part is about two\r\nfurlongs; and toward the right, on the opposite side, the third fall\r\nappears in a very advantageous point of view. About one-half of the\r\nHorse-shoe fall is concealed by the projecting cliff, but its partial\r\nprospect is extremely fine. The bottom of the former of these falls is\r\nskirted with a beautiful white foam, which ascends from the rock in\r\nthick volumes, but does not rise into the air like a cloud of smoke, as\r\nis the case with that of the latter fall, although its spray is so\r\nconsiderable, as to descend like a shower of rain, near the second\r\nladder, on the opposite side of the river. On its brink, and along the\r\nstrand, to the great fall, are to be constantly seen shattered trees and\r\nbodies of animals, which have been carried away by the extreme violence\r\nof the current.\r\n\r\nThe color of the water of the cataracts, as it descends perpendicularly\r\non the rocks, is occasionally a dark green, and sometimes a foaming,\r\nbrilliant white, displaying a thousand elegant variations, according to\r\nthe state of the atmosphere, the hight of the sun, or the force of the\r\nwind. A portion of the spray, resulting from the falls, frequently\r\ntowers above the hight, and literally mingles with the clouds: while the\r\nremainder, broken in its descent by fragments of rocks, is in continual\r\nagitation. The noise, irregularity, and rapid descent of the stream,\r\ncontinue about eight miles further; and the river is not sufficiently\r\ncalm to admit of navigation, till it reaches Queenstown, on the west\r\nside of the river, and nine miles from the falls.\r\n\r\nA late tourist has given us a more recent and fresh view of this\r\nwonderful cataract, which will aid us more fully to understand its\r\nvarious aspects as taken from different points of observation. “From the\r\nbank just below the ‘Clifton House,’ he says, “is perhaps the finest\r\npanoramic view of the falls. The general outline bears a resemblance to\r\nthe shape of a human ear; the great Horseshoe fall [which is represented\r\non the right hand of the cut below] constituting the upper lobe, while\r\nGoat island and the American fall [as seen on the left] represent the\r\nremaining portion. The river, whose general course has been east and\r\nwest, makes a sharp turn to the right just at the point where the fall\r\nnow is. Its breadth is here contracted from three-fourths of a mile to\r\nless than one-fourth. The Horseshoe fall only occupies the head of the\r\nchasm, while the American cataract falls over its side; so that this\r\nfall and a part of the Horseshoe lie directly parallel with the Canada\r\nshore, and its whole extent can be taken in at a single glance. It is\r\nthis oneness of aspect which renders the prospect from this side so much\r\nthe more impressive for a first view of Niagara. It gives a strong,\r\nsharp outline which may afterward be filled up at leisure.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NIAGARA FALLS.]\r\n\r\n“The most complete view of the Horseshoe fall is that from the bottom of\r\nthe cliff, at a point near the ferry landing. If, however, the water is\r\nunusually high, the quiet pool which is ordinarily seen in the\r\nforeground, becomes a fierce and angry rush of waters, foaming above and\r\naround the jagged rocks. If the water is very low, the bed of this pool\r\nis entirely dry. Last year [1852] there were but few days when the whole\r\nspot was not overflowed. The current nearest the Canada shore runs\r\nup-stream, as though seeking an outlet in the direction from which it\r\ncame. The middle distance is marked by a line of white foam, beyond\r\nwhich the current runs downstream. The center of the Horse-shoe fall is\r\ndirectly in front, defined on the right by the verge of Table Rock, and\r\non the left by the upper extremity of Goat island. Just below the tower\r\nwhich seems to rise from the midst of the waters on the American side,\r\nan immense mass of rock is dimly visible, which became detached from the\r\nprecipice in February, 1852.\r\n\r\n“A very charming glimpse of that portion of the fall directly in front\r\nof the tower, may be caught through a clump of trees which stand a\r\nlittle above the ferry landing. The limitation of view hightens the\r\neffect, when contrasted with the unlimited prospect of the fall\r\npresented from almost every other point on the Canada side.\r\n\r\n“It is no very difficult task for a stout pedestrian to make his way\r\nalong under the edge of the precipice from the ferry up to the foot of\r\nthe fall. The path winds among huge fragments of rock which have tumbled\r\nfrom above, and is slippery with the falling spray. You stop to rest\r\nupon a huge rock, where a couple of rough-coated men are fishing. They\r\ntell you that it is named ‘Bass rock,’ and you recognize the propriety\r\nof the appellation, as you observe the finny spoil that has repaid their\r\nlabor. The water rushes foaming and eddying around the fragments of\r\nrock, sometimes rising in great swells to the spot on which you stand.\r\nFragments of timber, their ends rounded and worn like pebbles on a\r\nwave-beaten shore, are scattered around: some groaning and tossing in\r\nthe water, others stranded high and dry upon the rocks, where they have\r\nbeen flung by some swell higher than usual. You are so near the foot of\r\nthe fall that the descending sheet of water occupies the entire field of\r\nvision: the immense rock which interposes between Bass rock and the\r\ndescending water has as yet received no distinctive name.\r\n\r\n“The path now begins to ascend the sloping bank, winding around huge\r\nbowlders, and among gay shrubs which the perpetual spray nourishes in\r\nluxuriant greenness, wherever there is a resting-place for a patch of\r\nsoil. At last you reach the dilapidated staircase which descends the\r\nperpendicular face of the cliff, and clambering around its base upon a\r\nrotten and slimy plank, you find yourself below the overhanging mass of\r\nTable Rock. You are close at the edge of the falling water, which\r\ndescends in a mass apparently as solid as though carved from marble. You\r\nnow begin to comprehend the hight of the fall. It makes you dizzy to\r\nlook up to the upper edge of the rushing column. You stand just midway\r\nbetween the top and the bottom. Above you hangs the imminent mass of\r\nTable Rock; below, far down by the wet and jagged rocks, is the seething\r\nwhirlpool, where the water writhes and eddies as though frenzied with\r\nits fearful leap. Round and round it goes in solemn gyrations, bearing\r\nwith it whatever floating object may have been plunged into its vortex.\r\n\r\n“A year ago this very month of August, a young woman walked in the cool\r\ngray morning down to the brink of the cliff and flung herself into the\r\nwhirlpool below. So resolute was the leap, that she shot clear of the\r\njagged rocks at the base, and plunged sheer into the water beyond. When\r\nthe visitors came sauntering down to the fall, her body was seen\r\nwhirling round and round in the mad eddies, now submerged for an\r\ninstant, and then leaping up, as though imploring aid. A day or two\r\nafterward, I was one of a group to whom a rough-looking man was\r\ndescribing the scene. He told how he and two others had descended amid\r\nthe blinding spray close to the foot of the fall. A rope was then\r\nfastened to his body, which was held fast from above by the others,\r\nwhile he groped his misty way down to the very edge of the waters, where\r\nhe waited till they whirled the corpse close inshore. He then darted a\r\nspear with a spring-barb into the body, but the force of the current\r\ntore out the hold, and it drifted away. Again it came within reach, and\r\nagain the hold of the spear was too weak to overcome the force of the\r\ncurrent. A third time the body approached, and the spear was darted.\r\nThis time it caught among the strong muscles of the thigh, and held, so\r\nthat the body was drawn to shore. The narrator was a rough man, roughly\r\nclad, and told his story roughly; but there was in his voice a low\r\nthrill of horror as he told how he was obliged to cut the spear-head out\r\nof the flesh with his knife, before the weapon could be extracted: ‘It\r\nwas too bad,’ said he; ‘but it couldn’t be helped.’ And it was with\r\nunconscious pathos that he told how they stripped off their own rough\r\ngarments, and tenderly covered the poor maimed and mutilated body before\r\nthey bore it up the bank. It was a commentary, wrought out into\r\npractice, upon Hood’s immortal ‘Bridge of Sighs.’\r\n\r\n“With the exception of the fall itself, the Canada side presents little\r\nof interest. The brink of the gorge is bare and naked, the trees which\r\nonce clothed it having been cut away. The regular drive seems to be up\r\nto the Burning Spring, and thence back by way of Drummondville and\r\nLundy’s Lane. At the Burning Spring you register your name, pay your\r\nfee, and are introduced into a small apartment, in the floor of which is\r\na spring in constant ebullition from the escape of an inflammable gas.\r\nThe flaxen-pated children of the show-woman place a receiver over the\r\nspring, and set fire to the gas, as it comes out of the jet; they then\r\nremove the receiver, and light the gas as it rises to the surface of the\r\nwater; and that is all. You take your departure, looking vastly edified;\r\nwhile the driver thrusts his tongue into his cheek, as though he were\r\nmentally quoting a certain proverb touching ‘a fool and his money.’\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Niagara Falls on the American side]\r\n\r\n“In the early morning you commit yourself to the little boat in which\r\nyou are to be ferried over to the American shore. Your half-felt\r\nmisgivings are dissipated as you see the dexterous manner with which the\r\nbrawny boatman handles his oars, and takes advantage of the ‘up-eddy’\r\nand ‘down-eddy;’ and in a few minutes you are landed close at the foot\r\nof the American fall. Half-way up the ferry-stairs is an opening which\r\ngives access to a path along the foot of the perpendicular precipice to\r\nthe verge of the falling water. From this point in the early morning,\r\nmay be gained one of the most picturesque views of Niagara. Your\r\nposition gives a fine view of the fall on the American side, as seen in\r\nthe cut; the hight of which forms a standard by which you measure that\r\nof the Horseshoe fall, which stretches away in the distant perspective.\r\nCompleting the ascent of the ferry-stairway, you reach Prospect point,\r\nat its head, from whence the same general view is gained, from a more\r\nelevated point. It is hard to say whether the view from above or below\r\nis the finer. The latter brings more into notice the hight of the\r\nfalling column of water, thus gaining an additional element of grandeur,\r\nwhile the latter embraces a view of the wooded islands above the fall,\r\nadding greatly to the picturesque effect. The precise point from which\r\nthe artist has taken this sketch is not now attainable. It was a\r\nprojecting shelf of rock, a few feet below the precipice, which has been\r\ncut away to make room for the terribly unpicturesque, but most\r\nconvenient stairway.\r\n\r\n“This was apparently the point from which honest Father Hennepin, who\r\nhas left us the earliest written account of Niagara, gazed upon that\r\n‘prodigious Cadence of Waters, which falls down after a surprising and\r\nastonishing Manner, insomuch that the Universe can not afford its\r\nparallel.’ ‘The Waters,’ goes on the quaint narrative, ‘which fall from\r\nthis horrible Precipice, do foam and boyle after the most hideous Manner\r\nimaginable, making an outrageous Noise more terrible than that of\r\nThunder.’ The good Jesuit would seem to have been deeply moved by this\r\n‘dismal Roaring;’ for in the curious picture which he gives of the\r\nfalls, he represents the spectators holding their hands to their ears to\r\nshut out the din; and he hints that the Indians were forced to abandon\r\nthe neighborhood of the falls, lest they should become deafened by the\r\nuproar. But the good father must have heard the ‘horrid Noise of the\r\nFalls,’ as he elsewhere calls it, with the imagination rather than with\r\nthe ear. You hardly notice it as you loiter along the brink, except when\r\nsome sudden atmospheric change varies its deep and solemn monotone. The\r\nsound is like the continuous and pervading murmur of the wind through a\r\nforest of somber pines. You are not forced to raise your voice in\r\nconversing with a friend by whose side you loiter along the brink of the\r\nfall, toward the bridge which gives you access to the wooded islands\r\nthat beckon you on.\r\n\r\n“Nothing can exceed the picturesque beauty of the small wooded islands\r\nwhich stud the rapids upon the American side. Two of rare beauty, known\r\nas Ship and Brig islands, stem the current a little above the bridge\r\nwhich connects Goat island with the shore. It needs but little effort of\r\nthe imagination to fancy them vessels under full press of sail,\r\nendeavoring to sheer out of the current that hurries them inevitably\r\ndown. The former of these islands is accessible by a bridge which\r\nconnects it with Bath island, and is one of the loveliest spots\r\nimaginable. The old cedars, whose gnarled and contorted trunks overhang\r\nthe waters, dipping their branches into the current, seem to cling with\r\ndesperate clutch to the rocks, as though fearful of losing their hold\r\nand being swept away.\r\n\r\n“From the bridge leading to Goat island, the rapids present that same\r\nappearance of plunging from the sky which renders their view from the\r\nCanadian shore so impressive. Goat island—so let it still be called, in\r\nspite of the foppery which has lately attempted to change its name to\r\nIris island—presents an aspect almost as wild as it did before it had\r\nbeen rendered accessible to human foot. Were it not for the path which\r\ngirdles its entire circumference, and the rustic seats disposed here and\r\nthere, one might fancy that he was the first who had ever sauntered\r\nthrough its grand and stately woods. The beauty and variety of the trees\r\non this island are wonderful. There is the maple, greeting the early\r\nspring sunshine with its fire-tipped buds; spreading out in summer its\r\nbroad dome of dark green leaves in masses so thick, that beneath them\r\nyou have no fear of the passing shower; and in autumn wearing its\r\ngorgeous crimson robe like an oriental monarch. The beech shows its\r\ndappled trunk and bright green foliage at every point, giving perpetual\r\nlife and vivacity to the scene. The silvery trunks of the white birch\r\ngleam among the underwood. An occasional aspen, with its ever-quivering\r\nleaves, which almost shed a sense of breezy coolness in the stillest,\r\nsultriest day, contrasts finely with the dark evergreens by which it is\r\nrelieved. Almost all of our northern fauna have their representatives\r\nhere. Even upon the little Ship island, which can be crossed in any\r\ndirection in a dozen strides, and which appears to a hasty view but a\r\nmass of twisted and gnarled cedars, there are at least seven distinct\r\nspecies of trees. Those trees, however, which immediately overhang the\r\nfalls, have an aspect peculiar to themselves. They are bent, broken,\r\ntwisted and contorted, in every direction. They seem to be starting back\r\nin horror from the abyss before them, and to wind their long finger-like\r\nroots around the rocks, in order to maintain their hold.\r\n\r\n“One of these, an aged birch, growing upon the ridge known as the ‘Hog’s\r\nBack,’ affords a resting-place from which to gain one of the finest\r\nviews of the American falls. Right in front is the small central fall,\r\nand the footbridge which leads to Luna island, with its trees dwarfed\r\nand stunted by the weight of frozen spray which loads them in the\r\nwinter. Beyond is the serrated line of the American fall; while the\r\ndistance is filled up with the receding lines of the banks of the river\r\nbelow.\r\n\r\n“A few paces—past groups of blithe tourists, past companies of somber\r\nIndian girls in blue blankets and high-crowned hats, with their gay\r\nwares spread out at their feet—brings you to the Biddle staircase, down\r\nwhich you wind to the foot of the precipice. The path to the left leads\r\nalong the foot of the overhanging cliff, up to the verge of the\r\nHorseshoe fall, only a portion of whose circumference is visible from\r\nany point on the American shore. You are here close upon the fragments\r\nof rock that fell from just in front of the tower, in February, 1852,\r\nthe latest of those changes which are slowly and almost imperceptibly\r\naltering the form and position of the falls. This fall of rock was seen\r\nby an artist who has given us a faithful picture of its effects. He was\r\njust recovering from an illness, and while sitting in his room at the\r\nClifton House, on the opposite Canadian shore, he was startled by a\r\ncrash, almost like that of an earthquake. Tottering to the window, he\r\nbeheld the immense curtain of rock in front of the tower precipitated\r\nfrom its ancient hold, and lying in huge masses upon the ice below;\r\nwhile a few streams of water trickled down the brown cliff, where but a\r\nmoment before nothing had been seen but a surface of dazzling ice. The\r\nwater at this extremity of the fall descends in light feathery forms,\r\ncontrasting finely with the solid masses in which it seems to plunge\r\ndown the center of the sweeping curve. The tower is perched upon the\r\nvery brink of the precipice, so close that the next fall of rock must\r\ncarry it along with it. The path to the right from the foot of the\r\nstaircase, leads to the entrance to the Cave of the Winds, which lies\r\nbehind the central fall. It is hard to imagine how this cavern missed\r\nbeing called the ‘Cave of Æolus,’ by those classicists who have\r\nexhausted ancient mythology for appellations for our American scenery.\r\nBut it has escaped this infliction; and the ‘Cave of the Winds,’ it is,\r\nand will be. From the little house close by the entrance, where the\r\nrequisite changes of dress are made, you look down into an abyss of cold\r\ngray mist, driven ever and anon like showers of hail into your face, as\r\nyou grope your way down the rocky slope. Haste not, pause not. Here is\r\nthe platform, half-seen, half-felt amid the blinding spray. Shade of\r\nFather Hennepin, this is truly a ‘dismal roaring’ of wind and water. We\r\nare across, and stand secure on the smooth, shaly bottom of the cave.\r\nLook up: what a magnificent arch is formed by the solid rock on the one\r\nside, and the descending mass of water on the other. Which is the\r\nsolider and firmer you hardly know. Yet look again—for it is sunset—and\r\nsee what we shall see nowhere else on earth, three rainbows one within\r\nanother; not half-formed and incomplete, as is the scheme of our daily\r\nlife, but filling up the complete circle, perfect and absolute.\r\n\r\n“Upon an isolated rock at the very brink of the cataract stands a round\r\ntower. It is approached by a long, narrow bridge, resting now upon\r\nledges of solid rock, and now upon loose bowlders. From the balcony upon\r\nits summit, you can lean far over the edge of the precipice, and there\r\ncatch the freshness of the cloud of spray that rises evermore from the\r\nunseen foot of the great fall. Or you can climb down the low rock upon\r\nwhich the tower stands, and gather shells and pebbles from within arm’s\r\nlength of the verge of the descent, so gentle, to all appearance, is the\r\ncurrent. But be not over-bold. These waters, apparently so gentle, sweep\r\ndown with a force beyond your power to stem. Not many months ago, a man\r\nfell from the bridge into their smooth flow, and was in the twinkling of\r\nan eye swept to the brink of the descent. Here he lodged against one of\r\nthose rocks that lie apparently tottering upon the brow, looking over\r\nthe fearful descent, with as little power to retrace his course, as he\r\nwould have had to reascend the perpendicular fall. A rope was floated\r\ndown to him, which he had just strength to fasten around his body, and\r\nhe was drawn up from his perilous position.\r\n\r\n“It is usual to speak of the Horseshoe fall as Canadian; and our rather\r\nslow neighbors across the river have been wont to plume themselves upon\r\nthe possession of the more magnificent part of Niagara; while Young\r\nAmerica has been heard to mutter between his teeth something about\r\n‘annexation,’ on the ground that the lesser nation has no fair claim to\r\nthe possession of the major part of the crowning wonder of the\r\ncontinent. But the portion of Niagara belonging to Canada is hardly\r\nworth contending for. The boundary line between the two countries is the\r\ndeepest water, which runs far over toward the Canadian shore. The line\r\npasses through the lonely little isle in the center of the river, which\r\nhas never been trodden by human foot. Right through the very center of\r\nthe Horseshoe fall, where the water is greenest, cutting the thickest\r\npillar of spray, through the inmost convolution of the whirlpool,\r\nthrough the calmest part of the quiet reach of water above the\r\nsuspension bridge, through the maddest work of the rapids below, goes\r\nthe boundary line, leaving to Canada nothing of Niagara except Table\r\nRock, which yearly threatens to fall, and the half of the great fall:\r\nwhile to America it gives, together with full one-half of the Horseshoe\r\nfall, the varying beauties of the lesser cataracts, and the whole wealth\r\nof the lovely islands which gem the rapids.\r\n\r\n“The general form of the falls is slowly changing from age to age. When\r\nFather Hennepin saw them, a century and three-quarters ago, they\r\npresented little of that curved and indented outline which now forms\r\ntheir most striking peculiarity. The fall on the western side extended\r\nin nearly a straight line from the head of Goat island to Table Rock,\r\nwhich terminated in a bluff that turned a portion of the water from its\r\ndirect course, forming another cataract which fell to the east. A\r\ncentury later, this projecting rock had disappeared, but the spot which\r\nit had occupied was distinctly traceable. From the character of the\r\nstrata through which the water has slowly worn its way back from the\r\nshores of Lake Ontario, we learn what must have been the appearances of\r\nthe fall at any period of its history. Thus it can never have overcome\r\nthe descent of three hundred and fifty feet at Lewiston at a single\r\nleap, but must have formed at least three cataracts separated by\r\nintervening rapids. When the falls occupied the position of the\r\nwhirlpool, three miles below their present site, the descent was\r\nevidently greater than at any period before or since. But there never\r\ncan have been a period when their beauty equaled that which they present\r\nat the present age. The immense breadth of the sheet of falling water,\r\nits graceful sweep of curves, and the picturesque islands that stud the\r\nbrink, belong solely to our present Niagara. The falls recede at\r\npresent, we are told, at the rate of something less than a foot in a\r\nyear. Geology is able to predict that when a recession of a mile has\r\ntaken place, some five or six thousand years hence, the hight of the\r\nfall will be reduced by a score of feet. Another five thousand years\r\nwill subtract two score more of feet. Ten thousand years more, when the\r\nfall shall have worn its way four miles further back, all that\r\nconstitutes Niagara will have disappeared, and the whole descent will be\r\naccomplished by a series of rapids like those near the whirlpool.\r\n\r\n“It is strange how little of direct human interest is connected with\r\nNiagara. One would have supposed that it would have been a sacred spot\r\nwith the Indians; but, with the exception of a few graves on the upper\r\nextremity of Goat island, no special memorial of the aborigines exists\r\nhere. The falls have been known to the white race for too short a time\r\nto gather around them legendary associations. One or two points are\r\nassociated with the memory of a young Englishman who, something like a\r\nscore of years ago, set up as the ‘Hermit of the Falls.’ A picturesque\r\nlittle break in the rapids between Goat island and one of the rocky\r\nislets known as the Three Sisters, has been named from him the ‘Hermit’s\r\ncascade.’ It is a lovely spot, by the side of which one may lie under\r\nthe overarching trees, and while away the noontide hour, lulled into\r\ndreamy slumber by the deep voice of the cataract. This hermit seems\r\nhardly worthy of being made the hero of the falls. Little is told of him\r\nexcept that he was fond of music and of pacing by night along the margin\r\nof the river; that he was alike indisposed for human society and for\r\nclean linen. It is said, indeed, that he was accustomed to record his\r\nmusings in Latin, but as no fragments of these were discovered after his\r\ndeath, we may set the story down as apocryphal. A deeper tragic interest\r\nis attached to a tale, now some three years old, which will be told you\r\nas you stand by the margin of the lesser fall. A party of visitors stood\r\nhere, in gay discourse. Among them were a young man and his affianced\r\nbride, and with them a laughing child. The young man, catching up the\r\nchild, said sportively to her, ‘Now I shall throw you over;’ when she,\r\ngliding from his hold in affright, half real and half feigned, slipped,\r\nand falling, plunged headlong into the stream; he sprang after, but the\r\ncurrent was stronger than his strength, and swept them both down the\r\nsmooth slope, and over the fall. Their bodies, mangled and bruised, were\r\nrecovered from the rocks below.\r\n\r\n“The pedestrian can hardly find a pleasanter summer day’s ramble, than\r\nthat along the river to Lewiston, descending on the American side, and\r\nreturning by the opposite bank. For a mile below the falls, where the\r\nchannel is narrowest, the current is so smooth, that one might fancy he\r\nwas gazing down into some quiet tarn embosomed in the mountains, were it\r\nnot that you catch the white margin of the lower rapids just where the\r\nsuspension bridge stretches its slender line from the summits of the\r\nopposing cliffs.”\r\n\r\nThis bridge, a view of which is given in the cut below, is about two and\r\na half miles below the falls, and spans the river near the head of the\r\nrapids, above the whirlpool. From pier to pier it is eight hundred feet\r\nlong, and in breadth eight feet. It is suspended on eight wire cables,\r\nfour on each side, which pass over towers fifty-four feet high, built of\r\nheavy timber. The present structure is only the scaffolding for\r\nconstructing a larger bridge, intended for the passage of railroad cars.\r\nThe towers for the large bridge will be of solid masonry, each eighty\r\nfeet high. Each of the cables is eleven hundred feet long, and composed\r\nof seventy-two strong, No. 10 iron wires, closely wrapped round with\r\nsmall wire three times boiled in linseed oil, which anneals it, and\r\nprevents injury from rust or exposure to the weather. The cables, after\r\npassing over the piers on the banks, are fast anchored in solid masonry\r\nfifty feet back of them. The _suspenders_, which form the sides, are\r\ncomposed of eight wires each, and are four and a half feet apart. The\r\nbridge itself is two hundred feet above the water, and is a wonder alike\r\nof enterprise and art.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Suspension Bridge over Niagara River]\r\n\r\nOur tourist proceeds as follows. “In the quiet reach of the water below\r\nthis bridge, plies the little steamer, the Maid of the Mist. After\r\npassing the ugly, bustling little village growing up around the American\r\nextremity of the bridge, a path leads through quiet fields and woods\r\nalong the very verge of the precipice. Here and there some tree growing\r\nupon the brink forms a safe balustrade over which you lean, and look\r\ndown upon the green water dashing furiously through its confined channel\r\nfar below.\r\n\r\n“The whirlpool, three miles below the falls, is an adjunct worthy of\r\nNiagara. The stream makes a sharp bend just where the channel is\r\nnarrowest and the descent of the rapids the steepest. At the angle the\r\ncurrent has scooped out an immense basin, around whose whole\r\ncircumference the water circles before it can find an outlet. All\r\nfloating bodies that pass down the river are drawn into the whirlpool,\r\nwhere they are borne round and round for days, and weeks sometimes, it\r\nis said, before they make their escape. A practicable path winds down\r\nthe bank to the water’s edge. The character of the banks gradually\r\nchanges as we descend toward the outlet of the river. The hard limestone\r\noverlying the softer rock, and forming the perpendicular portion of the\r\ncliff, becomes thinner; the sloping talus at the foot grows higher, and\r\nthe rocks are clothed with a luxurious forest growth. A half mile below\r\nthe whirlpool is a deep cleft in the precipitous bank, which is\r\nconnected with a wild Indian legend ascribing terrible convulsions of\r\nnature, and even the approach of the fatal white men, to an unauthorized\r\nviolation of the privacy of a great demon who once abode here. This was\r\nthe scene of a terrible tragedy in the old French wars. A convoy of\r\nBritish soldiers fell into an ambush of Indians at this point, and were\r\nall, with the exception of two, slain outright or driven over the edge\r\nof the chasm. The little rivulet which flows over the brink, ran red\r\nwith the blood of the slaughtered, and thus gained the name, which it\r\nstill bears, of the Bloody Run.\r\n\r\n“Close by the Devil’s Hole, the railroad now in course of construction\r\nfrom Lewiston to the falls, gains the level of the top of the bank. From\r\nthis point downward, it is excavated in the face of the cliff, forming a\r\nsteep grade to its bottom. An almost continuous line of shanties,\r\noccupied by the laborers engaged in the excavation, extends along the\r\nvery verge of the precipice. It was curious, as I passed along in the\r\nearly April days, to see children whom we should scarcely trust out of\r\nthe nurse’s arms, sprawling upon the very verge of the cliff. The\r\nlaborers are apparently all Irish, and it is noteworthy to see how much\r\nmore intelligent is the aspect of the younger than of the older\r\nchildren. I thought I could distinguish by their mere physical\r\nappearance, those who were born under the freer and happier auspices\r\nwhich surround them here. At the foot of the cliff the suspension bridge\r\nstretches like a slender thread across the stream, its supporting towers\r\nresting on a ledge above the level of the roadway. No line of guards\r\nwatches the quiet frontiers of two great nations. The sole police is a\r\nsmall boy at the gate, and the only passport demanded is a shilling for\r\ntoll. You climb the smooth slope to the summit, where the shattered\r\nmonument to the noble Brock is the only memorial of the day when the\r\nthrice-won victory was at last wrenched from the hands of the Americans.\r\nA flock of sheep are cropping the tender herbage; a couple of lambs have\r\nfound a shady resting-place in the crumbling archway of the monument. To\r\nthe right the white village of Lewiston presents an aspect of bustling\r\nactivity; while to the left, on the opposite Canadian shore, Queenstown\r\nrests gray and somber. At your feet, just below the dilapidated memorial\r\nof war, the bridge, symbol of union, binds the two shores: may it never\r\nbe a pathway for the march of hostile armies!\r\n\r\n“There are two or three things in the way of excursion which must sooner\r\nor later be performed. Some bright afternoon, when the west is all\r\naglow, as you sit upon Table Rock, watching the clouds of spray momently\r\ntorn from the face of the descending column, the guide with the hollow\r\nvoice, whose mission is to conduct visitors behind the great sheet,\r\npresents himself. You commit yourself to his guidance, and donning the\r\nsuit of yellow oil-skin, follow him down the spiral staircase, along the\r\nbase of the precipice up to the verge of the cataract. You shudder, and\r\nhesitate to enter the blinding spray along that winding path, which\r\nseems in the dimness like a slender line drawn upon the face of the\r\nrock. The guide whispers a word of encouragement, deftly insinuating how\r\nboldly ‘the lady’ trod its slippery length. You take courage and\r\nadvance. You can scarcely breathe, much less see; but you feel that the\r\ntorrent is plunging from the immeasurable hight above into the\r\nunfathomable depth below. Somehow, how you hardly know, you have passed\r\nthrough the thick curtain of blinding spray, and are peering eagerly\r\ninto the gray depth beyond. You are on Termination rock, and further\r\nthan this mortal foot may never penetrate within the vail. Whichever way\r\nyou turn, it is all cold gray mist, shrouding the overhanging rock and\r\nthe overarching water above, and the profound depths below; all mist,\r\ncold gray mist above, below, around, except when you turn your eyes back\r\nalong the path by which you entered, where you behold a strip of golden\r\nsky between the grim rock and the edge of the descending flood. Drenched\r\nand dripping, spent and exhausted, as a shipwrecked sailor flung by the\r\nsurf upon some inhospitable shore, you follow your guide back along the\r\nmisty path, and emerge gladly enough into the clear outer air, into the\r\nfree sunshine, and beneath the bright sky. As you doff the heavy\r\noil-skin integuments, a printed paper is put into your hand, certifying\r\nthat you ‘have been under the great sheet of water, the distance of two\r\nhundred and forty feet from the commencement of the falls to the\r\ntermination of Table Rock,’ verified by the signature of the proprietor\r\nof ‘Table Rock House.’ Your guide looks on you complacently, as though\r\nhe would assure you that the great end of life was now attained, and you\r\nmight take up your ‘=Nunc dimittis=.’\r\n\r\n“Or you take your place upon the deck of the Maid of the Mist, hard by\r\nthe suspension bridge, and are steamed up to the foot of the cataract.\r\nThe little steamer answers but poorly to her romantic name. She swings\r\nwearily from her moorings, and goes panting and tugging up the current.\r\nYet she manages to hold her course, unless the wind blows too strong\r\ndown-stream, and slowly wins her way close up to the huge rocks on which\r\nthe waters of the American fall are broken and shattered into the\r\nthickest of spray. In that spray a sharp and angry gust of wind tears a\r\nsudden rent, and through it you catch a glimpse of the green crest of\r\nthe Horseshoe fall, sinking grandly into the ocean of vapor below. Or\r\nbetter still, if in some calm moonlight night, you glide, with the\r\nboatman, along the foot of the American fall, keeping just outside of\r\nthe dark line of shadow, you will find there is nothing on earth so\r\nweird and ghost-like as the spectacle before you. The column of spray\r\nrises from the blackness below, like the specter of some gigantic tree,\r\nand spreads solemnly up into the clear air above.\r\n\r\n“The mere summer tourist, however, sees but half the glory of Niagara.\r\nIn the winter the great rocks at the foot of the fall are piled up with\r\nan accumulation of frozen spray to the depth of half a hundred feet. By\r\ncreeping cautiously up the slippery ascent, you may stand face to face\r\nwith the cataract, half-way up its giddy hight. Every shrub on its\r\nmargin is loaded with glittering ice. The thick-branched evergreens are\r\nbowed beneath its weight, and bend to the ground like enormous plumes.\r\nThe face of the cold gray rock is cased in the frozen element, and\r\nribbed with pillars and pilasters which flash back the reflection of all\r\nthe gems in the rays of the sun; and when in a clear, unclouded day,\r\nthat sun shines down in its splendor, the scene is one of matchless\r\nmagnificence and glory.”\r\n\r\nThus we have attempted a full description of Niagara; and yet words seem\r\nbut feeble to set forth the magnificence and grandeur of the scene as it\r\nrises to the view of the actual beholder. There, in its vast volume and\r\nresistless power, it ever flows on with ceaseless, patient, unwearied\r\ntide. At midnight and noonday, through summer and winter, and seed-time\r\nand harvest, it is still the same. The drought of summer does not\r\nsensibly diminish, or the freshets of spring augment its mighty current.\r\nThe scorching sun does not dry it up, and the chains of winter do not\r\nbind it. Emblem of God and of eternity, it rolls on, speaking in calm\r\nsublimity of Him who made it. Nor is sublimity the only characteristic\r\nof this greatest of waterfalls. There are traits of beauty, which seem\r\neven to highten the effect of its grandeur. The rainbow, ever playing in\r\nsunshine over its awful front, and seeming indifferent to the boiling\r\nwhirlpool beneath; the tide of many-colored gems, into which the spray\r\noften seems converted, as it plunges over the rocks; the heaps of foam,\r\nwhite as wool, dancing on the billows that rush away from the foot of\r\nthe fall; and more than all, an aspect of tranquillity and of repose,\r\nwhich settles upon the whole scene, when viewed at a little distance,\r\nare all incidents which blend in the majestic picture imprinted on the\r\nmemory by this stupendous yet lovely work of nature’s God.\r\n\r\nThe falls of Niagara have been the frequent theme of poetry, but the\r\nfollowing lines by Brainard are deemed the finest that have been\r\nproduced upon the subject.\r\n\r\n          “The thoughts are strange that crowd into my brain,\r\n          While I look upward to thee. It would seem\r\n          As if God poured thee from his ‘hollow hand,’\r\n          And hung his bow upon thine awful front;\r\n          And spoke in that loud voice, which seemed to him\r\n          Who dwelt in Patmos for his Saviour’s sake,\r\n          ‘The sound of many waters;’ and had bade\r\n          Thy flood to chronicle the ages back,\r\n          And notch His centuries in the eternal rocks!\r\n\r\n          “Deep calleth unto deep, and what are we,\r\n          That hear the question of that voice sublime?\r\n          Oh! what are all the notes that ever rung\r\n          From war’s vain trumpet, by thy thundering side!\r\n          Yea, what is all the riot man can make\r\n          In his short life, to thine unceasing roar!\r\n          And yet, bold babbler, what art thou to Him,\r\n          Who drown’d a world, and heaped the waters far\r\n          Above its loftiest mountains?—a light wave,\r\n          That breaks and whispers of its Maker’s might!”\r\n\r\n\r\n                       FALLS OF THE MONTMORENCI.\r\n\r\nThe Montmorenci empties itself at the distance of about eight miles\r\nnortheast of Quebec, into the great river St. Lawrence, to the coast of\r\nwhich it gradually descends from the elevated mountain on which it has\r\nits source. At a station called La Motte, situated on the northern\r\nextremity of a sloping ground, its waters diffuse themselves into\r\nshallow currents, interrupted by rocks which break them into foam, and\r\naccompanied by murmuring sounds which enliven the solitude and solemn\r\nstillness prevailing throughout the surrounding forests and desolate\r\nhills. Further down, its channel is bounded by precipitous rocks, its\r\nbreadth becoming extremely contracted, and the rapidity of its current\r\nproportionably augmented. At a place called “the natural steps,” there\r\nare several beautiful cascades of ten or twelve feet. These steps, which\r\nare extremely regular, have been gradually formed by the accession of\r\nwaters the river receives in its progress, at the breaking up of winter,\r\nby the melting of the snows. From the middle of April to the end of May,\r\nits waters roll with increasing hight and rapidity. Being powerfully\r\nimpelled in their course, they insinuate themselves between the strata\r\nof the horizontal rock, vast fragments of which are detached by the\r\nrushing violence of the sweeping torrent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FALLS OF MONTMORENCI.]\r\n\r\nOn the eastern side, the bank, which is almost perpendicular, and fifty\r\nfeet high, is surmounted by lofty trees. The south-west bank rises\r\nbeyond the steps, and terminates in a precipice. On the opposite side,\r\nthe bank is regular, and of a singular shape, resembling the ruin of an\r\nelevated wall. The trees by which the banks are inclosed, united with\r\nthe effect produced by the foaming currents, and the scattered masses of\r\nstone, form a scene wild and picturesque. The stream now taking a\r\nsouthern direction, is augmented in its velocity, and forms a grand\r\ncascade interrupted by huge rocks. A quarter of a mile further down a\r\nsimilar effect is produced. After exhibiting an agreeable variety\r\nthrough its course, the river is precipitated, in an almost\r\nperpendicular direction, over a rock two hundred and fifty feet in\r\nhight. A view of this latter cascade is given in the cut. Wherever it\r\ntouches the rock, it falls in white clouds of rolling foam; and,\r\nbeneath, where it is propelled with uninterrupted gravitation, it forms\r\nnumerous flakes, like wool or cotton, which are gradually protracted in\r\nthe descent, until they are received into the boiling profound abyss\r\nbeneath.\r\n\r\nThe effect from the summit of the cliff is awfully grand, and truly\r\nsublime. The prodigious depth of the descent of the waters of this\r\nsurprising fall; the brightness and volubility of their course; the\r\nswiftness of their movement through the air; and the loud and hollow\r\nnoise emitted from the basin, swelling with incessant agitation from the\r\nweight of the dashing waters, forcibly combine to attract the attention,\r\nand to impress the mind of the spectator with sentiments of grandeur and\r\nelevation. The clouds of rising vapor, which assume the prismatic\r\ncolors, contribute to enliven the scene. They fly off from the fall in\r\nthe form of a revolving sphere, emitting with velocity pointed flakes of\r\nspray, which spread in receding, until they are interrupted by the\r\nneighboring banks, or dissolved in the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nThe breadth of the fall is one hundred feet; and the basin, which is\r\nbounded by steep cliffs, forms an angle of forty-five degrees. When\r\nviewed from the beach, the cataract is seen, with resplendent beauty, to\r\nflow down the gloomy precipice, the summit of which is crowded with\r\nwoods. The diffusion of the stream, to the breadth of fifteen hundred\r\nfeet, and the various small cascades produced by the inequalities of its\r\nrocky bed, on its way to the river St. Lawrence, display a very singular\r\nand pleasing combination.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            THE TUCCOA FALL.\r\n\r\nThis fall, in Franklin county, Georgia, is as yet scarcely known to the\r\nbest informed of our geographers, and is notwithstanding one of the most\r\nbeautiful that can be conceived. It is much higher than the great fall\r\nof Niagara; and the water is charmingly propelled over a perpendicular\r\nrock. When the stream is full, it passes down the steep in one expansive\r\nsheet, magnificent to behold.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         FALLS OF THE MISSOURI.\r\n\r\nThe most prominent features of this great river, which is fed by so many\r\nstreams, having their sources in a great variety of soils and climates,\r\nare its wonderful falls, rapids and cascades, the following connected\r\nview of which is abstracted from the very accurate draught and survey\r\nmade by Captain Clarke.\r\n\r\nThis river is nine hundred feet wide at the point where it receives the\r\nwaters of Medicine river, which is four hundred and one feet in width.\r\nThe united current continues five thousand, four hundred and twelve\r\nfeet, somewhat more than a mile, to a small rapid on the north side,\r\nfrom which it gradually widens to four thousand, two hundred feet, and\r\nat the distance of nine thousand and forty-two feet, (nearly a mile and\r\nthree-fourths,) reaches the head of the rapids, narrowing as it\r\napproaches them. Here the hills on the north, which had withdrawn from\r\nthe bank, closely border the river, which, for the space of a mile,\r\nmakes its way over the rocks with a descent of thirty feet: in this\r\ncourse the current is contracted to sixteen hundred and forty feet, and,\r\nafter throwing itself over a small pitch of five feet, forms a beautiful\r\ncascade of twenty-six feet, five inches; this does not, however, fall\r\nquite perpendicularly, being stopped by a part of the rock, which\r\nprojects at about one-third of the distance. After descending this fall,\r\nand passing the Cotton-wood island, on which the eagle has fixed its\r\nnest, the river goes on for eight thousand, seven hundred and\r\nseventy-eight feet, (more than a mile and a half,) over rapids and\r\nlittle falls, the estimated descent of which is thirteen feet six\r\ninches, till it is joined by a large fountain boiling up underneath the\r\nrocks near the edge of the river, and falling into it with a cascade of\r\neight feet. It is of the most perfect clearness, and rather of a bluish\r\ncast; and even after falling into the Missouri it preserves its color\r\nfor half a mile. From this fountain the river descends with increased\r\nrapidity for the distance of thirty-five hundred and thirty-one feet,\r\nduring which the estimated descent is five feet: from this, for a\r\ndistance of twenty-two hundred and twenty-seven feet, the river descends\r\nfourteen feet seven inches, including a perpendicular fall of six feet\r\nseven inches. The river has now become pressed into a space of fourteen\r\nhundred and nineteen feet, and here forms a grand cataract, by falling\r\nover a plain rock, the whole distance across the river, to the depth of\r\nforty-seven feet, eight inches: after recovering itself, the Missouri\r\nthen proceeds with an estimated descent of three feet, till at the\r\ndistance of sixteen hundred and eighty-three feet it again is\r\nprecipitated down the crooked falls, nineteen feet perpendicularly;\r\nbelow this at the mouth of a deep ravine, is a fall of five feet, after\r\nwhich, for the distance of sixteen thousand and five feet, (upward of\r\nthree miles,) the descent is much more gradual, not being more than ten\r\nfeet, and then succeeds a handsome level plain for the space of\r\ntwenty-nine hundred and thirty-seven feet, (more than half a mile,) with\r\na computed descent of three feet, making a bend toward the north. Thence\r\nit descends, during seventy-nine hundred and twenty feet, about eighteen\r\nfeet and a half, when it makes a perpendicular fall of two feet, which\r\nis fourteen hundred and eighty-five feet beyond the great cataract, in\r\napproaching which it descends thirteen feet, within a distance of about\r\nsix hundred feet, and gathering strength from its confined channel,\r\nwhich is only eight hundred and forty feet wide, rushes over the fall to\r\nthe depth of eighty-seven feet and three-quarters of an inch. After\r\nraging among the rocks, and losing itself in foam, it is compressed\r\nimmediately into a bed of two hundred and seventy-nine feet in width; it\r\ncontinues for fifty-six hundred and ten feet to the entrance of a run or\r\ndeep ravine, where there is a fall of three feet, which, joined to the\r\ndecline of the river during that course, makes the descent six feet. As\r\nit goes on, the descent within the next thirty-nine hundred and sixty\r\nfeet is only four feet; from this, passing a run or deep ravine, the\r\ndescent for sixteen hundred feet is thirteen feet: within thirty-nine\r\nhundred and sixty feet, is a second descent of eighteen feet; thence\r\ntwenty-six hundred and forty feet further, is a descent of six feet;\r\nafter which, to the mouth of Portage creek, a distance of forty-six\r\nhundred and twenty feet, the descent is ten feet. From this survey and\r\nestimate it results that the river experiences a descent of three\r\nhundred and fifty-two feet in the course of fifteen or sixteen miles,\r\nfrom the commencement of the rapids, to the mouth of Portage creek,\r\nexclusive of almost impassable rapids which extend for a mile below its\r\nentrance.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CATSKILL FALLS.\r\n\r\nThe Catskill, or Kauterskill falls, represented in the cut below, are in\r\nthe south-west part of the town of Catskill, about fourteen miles from\r\nthe village, and two miles west from Pine Orchard, a celebrated summer\r\nresort on the brow of the Catskill mountain. Two ponds, uniting their\r\noutlets, pour the stream thus formed, by falls and rapids in a deep\r\nravine, to the plain below. The first fall is a hundred and eighty feet\r\nperpendicular; and the second, which is within a short distance, about\r\neighty feet. Behind the first fall is an immense natural amphitheater,\r\ninto which the visitor can go, and look through the water as it falls\r\nfrom above. The view from the ‘Mountain house,’ near by, is extensive\r\nand varied. The landscape, in a clear atmosphere, is visible for sixty\r\nmiles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n                             TRENTON FALLS.\r\n\r\nAmong the most beautiful and romantic cascades of the United States, may\r\njustly be reckoned Trenton falls, situated about eighteen miles\r\nnorth-east of Utica, in the state of New York, on West Canada creek.\r\nHere, within a course of two miles, there are six falls, with an\r\naggregate descent of three hundred and twelve feet. The scenery is the\r\nmost wild and picturesque imaginable; the stream flowing through a\r\nnarrow ravine, between perpendicular walls of limestone, which in some\r\nplaces are one hundred and fifty feet high. The pathway of the spectator\r\nis mostly along the very margin of the chasm which forms the channel of\r\nthe rushing waters, on a ledge, or shelf, so narrow and perilous, that\r\nthe head often is giddy from the sight; and sometimes it is difficult to\r\nsustain one’s self. These cascades are more remarkable for the wildness\r\nand variety of scenery, than for the volume of water they present. The\r\nhight of the principal fall is estimated at one hundred feet.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       WATERFALL OF SOUTH AFRICA.\r\n\r\nThe great chain of mountains which runs from north to south through the\r\ncolony of the Cape of Good Hope, divides into two branches, one of which\r\nstretches south-east, and the other due south. At the extremity of the\r\nlatter branch is “the waterfall mountain,” in one of the clefts of which\r\na large stream of water falls from the high rock above, and presents, in\r\nthe winter season, when swollen by the rains, a glorious spectacle. To\r\nview this fall to advantage, the traveler has to climb to a considerable\r\nhight over the steep and broken rocks which form one side of the\r\nmountain, and, on reaching the top, sees it on the other side. Its hight\r\nis estimated at between eighty and ninety feet, and its breadth at\r\nbetween thirty and forty. Adequate terms can not be found to describe\r\nthe sublimity of this scene, after abundant rains, when it is in its\r\nfull beauty. In the vale beneath, the water is collected in a vast and\r\ndeep basin, excavated in the stone; and by the side of the stream is a\r\ngrotto, which runs within the rock to the depth of between thirty and\r\nforty feet. The arched entrance to this grotto is close to the falling\r\nwater, when the stream is full. The rocks about it are thickly grown\r\nover with shrubs, which are then sprinkled by the spray. The European\r\ntravelers who proceed from Cape Town to the interior of South Africa,\r\nseldom fail to make a pilgrimage to this enchanting spot.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         CATARACTS OF THE NILE.\r\n\r\nThis celebrated river, through its long and fertile range of about two\r\nthousand British miles, in winding through abrupt and precipitous\r\ncountries, exhibits very considerable cataracts, ten or twelve of which,\r\nhaving a descent of more than twenty feet, occur, before it reaches the\r\nlevel of Egypt. The one which, by way of eminence, is called the\r\ncataract of the Nile, was visited by Mr. Bruce, from whose relation the\r\nfollowing particulars are extracted.\r\n\r\nAt the distance of half a mile beneath the cataract, the river is\r\nconfined between two rocks, over which a strong bridge of a single arch\r\nhas been thrown, and runs into a deep trough, with great roaring, and an\r\nimpetuous velocity. On ascending, the cataract presents itself amid\r\ngroves of beautiful trees, and exhibits a most magnificent and\r\nstupendous sight, such as, Mr. Bruce observes, ages, added to the\r\ngreatest length of human life, could not efface or eradicate from his\r\nmemory. It struck him with a kind of stupor, and total oblivion of where\r\nhe was, as well as of every sublunary concern. At the time of his visit,\r\nthe river had been considerably increased by rains, and fell in one\r\nsheet of water, above half an English mile in breadth, and to the depth\r\nof at least forty feet, with a force and noise which were truly\r\nterrific, and which, for a time, stunned him, and made him giddy. A\r\nthick fume, or haze, covered the fall in every part, and hung over the\r\ncourse of the stream both above and below, marking its track, although\r\nthe waters were not seen. The river, although much swollen, preserved\r\nits natural clearness, and fell, partly into a deep pool, or basin, in\r\nthe solid rock, and partly in twenty different eddies to the very foot\r\nof the precipice. In falling, a portion of the stream appeared to run\r\nback with great fury on the rock, as well as forward in the line of its\r\ncourse, raising waves, or violent ebullitions, which chafed against each\r\nother.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        CATARACT OF THE MENDER.\r\n\r\nThe cataract which constitutes the source of this river, the Scamander\r\nof the ancients, is thus beautifully described by Doctor Clarke. “Our\r\nascent, as we drew near to the source of the river, became steep and\r\nrocky. Lofty summits towered above us, in the greatest style of alpine\r\ngrandeur; the torrent, in its rugged bed below, all the while foaming on\r\nour left. Presently we entered one of the sublimest natural\r\namphitheaters the eye ever beheld; and here the guides desired us to\r\nalight. The noise of waters silenced every other sound. Huge craggy\r\nrocks rose perpendicularly, to an immense hight; whose sides and\r\nfissures, to the very clouds, concealing their tops, were covered with\r\npines. These grew in every possible direction, among a variety of\r\nevergreen shrubs; and enormous plane-trees waved their vast branches\r\nabove the torrent. As we approached its deep gulf, we beheld several\r\ncascades, all of foam, pouring impetuously from chasms in the naked face\r\nof a perpendicular rock. It is said the same magnificent cataract\r\ncontinues all seasons of the year, wholly unaffected by the casualties\r\nof rain or melting snow. Having reached the chasms whence the torrent\r\nissues, we found, in their front, a beautiful natural basin, six or\r\neight feet in depth, serving as a reservoir for the water during the\r\nfirst moments of its emission. It was so clear that the minutest object\r\nmight be discerned at the bottom. The copious overflowing of this\r\nreservoir causes the appearance, to a spectator below, of different\r\ncascades, falling to the depth of about forty feet, but there is only\r\none source. Behind are the chasms whence the water issues. We entered\r\none of these, and passed into a cavern. Here the water appeared, rushing\r\nwith great force, beneath the rock, toward the basin on the outside. The\r\nwhole of the rock about the source was covered with moss; close to the\r\nbasin grew hazel and plane trees; above were oaks and pines; and all\r\nbeyond a naked and fearful precipice.”\r\n\r\nThe bold and precipitous country of the Alps offers a variety of\r\nwaterfalls and perpendicular torrents which are well deserving of\r\nnotice; more particularly those in the vicinity of Mount Rosa, a part of\r\nthe northern boundary of Piedmont. The river Oreo, fed by numerous\r\nstreams from Mount St. Gothard, Mount Cenis, and several branches of the\r\nApennines, forms, at Cerosoli, a vertical cascade, estimated at four\r\nhundred fathoms, or twenty-four hundred feet; while the torrent Evanson,\r\ndescending from another part of Mount Rosa, exhibits a fall of more than\r\ntwo hundred fathoms, rolling down pebbles of quartz, veined with the\r\ngold which is occasionally traced in the mountains of Challand. The\r\nCascata del Marmore, or Marble Cascade, so denominated from the mountain\r\ndown which the Velcino falls being almost wholly of marble, lies about\r\nthree miles from Terni. In proceeding toward it, the traveler is struck\r\nwith terror on viewing the precipices, which are of a romantic hight;\r\nbut is sufficiently rewarded, when, on reaching the summit of the\r\nmountain, he regards the stupendous cataract, formed by the river as it\r\nrushes from the mountain. Having reached the declivity of its channel,\r\nthe waters descend with a rapid course for a short space, and then fall\r\nfrom a perpendicular hight of three hundred feet, breaking against\r\nlateral rocks, which cause vapors to ascend much higher than the summit\r\nof the cataract, by which the neighboring valley receives a perpetual\r\nfall of rain. After this descent, the waters rush into the cavities of\r\nthe rocks, and then bursting through several openings, at length reach\r\nthe bed of the river.\r\n\r\nThe grand cascade of the Anio, near Tivola, flows down the edge of a\r\nsteep rock; and at its foot, the water, in a succession of ages, has\r\nhollowed grottos of various shapes and sizes, in a manner so beautifully\r\npicturesque, as to baffle all description. Of these, the grotto of\r\nNeptune is the most celebrated. Near to it are three smaller cascades,\r\nwhich rush murmuring through the ruins of the villa Mecænas, down the\r\nwoody steep which forms the opposite bank of the river, and present the\r\npainter with one of the most picturesque views imaginable, the\r\nforeground varying beautifully at every step he takes.\r\n\r\nIn Savoy, the Arve flows many miles between high, craggy and\r\ninaccessible rocks, which appear to have been purposely cleft to give\r\nits waters a free passage. The surprising echoes and continual sounds\r\noccasioned by its streams, the trampling of the horses and mules, the\r\nhallooing of passengers, &c., are, in these places, reverberated three,\r\nfour, and even in some parts six or seven times, with a noise so deep\r\nand wild, as to strike with terror the traveler who is unaccustomed to\r\nthem; and the firing of a gun or pistol, is there more terrible than the\r\nloudest claps of thunder. A steep precipice, with monstrous impending\r\nrocks, which seem ready to fall, joined to the roaring of the river, add\r\nlargely to the general sublimity. The cataracts of this river are more\r\nor less loud and terrible, in proportion as the waters are more or less\r\nswollen by the melting snows, with which the tops of the mountains are\r\ncovered. One in particular, called the Nun of Arpena, falls from a\r\nprodigiously high rock with great noise and violence: its descent is\r\nsaid to exceed eleven hundred feet.\r\n\r\nIn Dalmatia, the river Cettina forms a magnificent cascade, called by\r\nthe inhabitants Velica Gubavisa, to distinguish it from a less fall a\r\nlittle below. The waters precipitate themselves from a hight of above\r\none hundred and fifty feet, forming a deep majestic sound, which is\r\ncaused by the echo resounding between the steep and naked marble banks.\r\nMany broken fragments of rocks, which impede the course of the river\r\nafter its fall, break the waves, and render them still more lofty and\r\nsonorous. By the violence of the repercussion, their froth flies off in\r\nsmall white particles, and is raised in successive clouds, which are\r\nscattered, by the agitation of the air, over the valley. When these\r\nclouds ascend directly upward, the inhabitants expect the noxious\r\nsouth-east wind called the sirocco.\r\n\r\nThe fall of the Staub-Bach, in the valley of Lauterbrannen, is estimated\r\nat nine hundred feet of perpendicular hight; and about a league from\r\nSchaffhausen, at the village of Lauffen, in Switzerland, is a tremendous\r\ncataract of the Rhine, where that river precipitates itself from a rock\r\nsaid to be seventy feet in hight, and not less than four hundred and\r\nfifty feet broad.\r\n\r\nIn Sweden, near Gottenburgh, the river Gotha rushes down from a\r\nprodigiously high precipice into a deep pit, with a dreadful noise, and\r\nwith such amazing force, that the trees designed for the masts of ships,\r\nwhich are floated down the river, are usually turned upside down in\r\ntheir fall, and shattered in pieces. They frequently sink so far under\r\nwater, as to disappear for a quarter of an hour, half an hour, and\r\nsometimes for three-quarters of an hour. The pit into which the torrent\r\nprecipitates them, is of a depth not to be ascertained, having been\r\nsounded with a line of several hundred fathoms, without the bottom being\r\nfound.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the other North American cataracts already described, may\r\nbe noticed the Passaic falls, formed by the river Passaic, which\r\ndischarges itself into the sea at the northern extremity of the state of\r\nNew Jersey. About twenty miles from the mouth of this river, where it\r\nhas a breadth of about a hundred and twenty feet, and runs with a very\r\nswift current, it reaches a deep chasm, or cleft, which crosses its\r\nchannel, and falls about seventy feet perpendicularly in an entire\r\nsheet. One end of the cleft is closed up, and the water rushes out of\r\nthe other with incredible rapidity, in an acute angle to its former\r\ndirection, and is received into a large basin. It thence takes a winding\r\ncourse through the rocks, and spreads again into a very considerable\r\nchannel. The cleft is from four to twelve feet in breadth, and is\r\nsupposed to have been produced by an earthquake. The falls of St.\r\nAnthony, on the river Mississippi, descend from a perpendicular hight of\r\nthirty feet, and are nearly eight hundred feet in width, while the shore\r\non each side is a level flat, without any intervening rock or precipice.\r\n\r\nIn England, among the cataracts which merit a brief mention, may be\r\ncited the one in Devonshire, near the spot where the Tamer receives the\r\nsmall river Lid. The water there falls above a hundred feet: it proceeds\r\nfrom a mill at some distance, and after a course on a descent of nearly\r\none hundred feet from the level of the mill, reaches the brink of the\r\nprecipice, whence it falls in a most beautiful and picturesque manner,\r\nand, striking on a part of the cliff, rushes from it in a wider cataract\r\nto the bottom; where falling again with great violence, it makes a deep\r\nand foaming basin in the ground. This fine sheet of water causes the\r\nsurrounding air at the bottom to be so impregnated with aqueous\r\nparticles, that those who approach it find themselves in a mist. In\r\nCumberland there are several cataracts; but these are exceeded in beauty\r\nby a remarkable fall of the Tees, on the western side of the county of\r\nDurham, over which is a bridge suspended by chains, seldom passed unless\r\nby the adventurous miners. Asgarth force, in Yorkshire, is likewise a\r\nvery interesting fall.\r\n\r\nIn Scotland, the fall of Eyers, near Loch Ness, is a vast cataract, in a\r\ndarksome glen of a stupendous depth. The water rushes beneath, through a\r\nnarrow gap between two rocks, and thence precipitating itself more than\r\nforty feet lower into the bottom of the chasm, the foam, like a great\r\ncloud of smoke, rises and fills the air. The sides of this glen are\r\nstupendous precipices, blended with trees overhanging the water, through\r\nwhich, after a short space, the waters discharge themselves into the\r\nlake. About half a mile to the south of this fall, is another which\r\npasses through a narrow chasm, whose sides it has undermined for a\r\nconsiderable distance. Over the gap is a true alpine bridge, formed of\r\nthe trunks of trees covered with sods, from the middle of which is an\r\nawful view of the water roaring beneath. In Perthshire, the river Keith\r\npresents a very considerable cataract, the noise produced by which is so\r\nviolent as to stun those who approach it. The western coast of\r\nRoss-shire is, however, peculiarly distinguished by these natural\r\nwonders, among which may be cited the grand cataract of the river\r\nKirkag, and the cascade of Glamma, which latter being situated amid the\r\nconstant obscurity of woody hills, is truly sublime.\r\n\r\nIn Ireland, the noble river Shannon has a prodigious cataract, which, at\r\nabout fifty miles from its mouth, prevents it from being longer\r\nnavigable for vessels of a large burden.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           SPRINGS AND WELLS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          ST. WINIFRED’S WELL.\r\n\r\nHolywell, in Flintshire, is famous for St. Winifred’s well, one of the\r\nfinest springs in the world. On account of the sanctity in which it was\r\nholden, it gave name to the town. This well pours out, each minute,\r\n_twenty-one tuns of water_, which, running to the middle of the town,\r\ndown the side of a hill, is made use of by every house as it passes,\r\nafter which it turns several mills, and is employed in various\r\nmanufactures, which greatly increase the population of the place and its\r\nneighborhood. Over the spring, where a handsome bath has been erected,\r\nis a neat chapel, supported by pillars, and on the windows are painted\r\nthe chief events of St. Winifred’s (or, as it was anciently written,\r\nWenefrede’s) life. About the well grows moss, which the ignorant and\r\nsuperstitious devotees most stupidly imagine to be St. Winifred’s hair.\r\nThis saint is reported to have been a virgin martyr, who lived in the\r\nseventh century, and, as the legend says, was ravished and beheaded in\r\nthis place by a pagan tyrant; the spring having miraculously risen from\r\nher blood. Hence this bath was much frequented by popish pilgrims, out\r\nof devotion, as well as by those who came to bathe in it for medicinal\r\npurposes. Mr. Pennant says, “The custom of visiting this well in\r\npilgrimage, and offering up devotions there, is not yet entirely laid\r\naside: in the summer a few are to be seen in the water, in deep\r\ndevotion, up to their chins for hours, sending up their prayers, or\r\nperforming a number of evolutions round the polygonal well.”\r\n\r\nIt might have been supposed that the present enlightened age would have\r\nbeen secure against a repetition of impostures of this kind; but Doctor\r\nMilner, a Catholic bishop, of Wolverhampton, took much pains to persuade\r\nthe world that an ignorant proselyte, of the name of Winefrid White, was\r\nthere cured of various chronic diseases, so late as the year 1804, by a\r\nmiracle. Sir Richard Phillips, having, in the Monthly Magazine, referred\r\nthis pretended miracle to the known effect of strong faith on ignorant\r\nminds, in any proposed means of cure, was attacked by the Catholic\r\nclergy for his incredulity; but in number three hundred and two, of the\r\nMonthly Magazine, he replies in the following words.\r\n\r\n“We have no doubt whatever that Winefrid White was cured by her journey\r\nto Holywell, and by bathing in the wonderful natural spring at that\r\nplace; but we are not credulous enough to believe that her cure was\r\neffected by any antagonist properties of the water to the cause of her\r\ndisease; nor impious enough so to sport with eternal omnipotence, as to\r\nassert that a capricious suspension of the laws of nature took place for\r\nthis purpose. On the contrary, we believe that the poor woman was cured\r\nby causes well known to every medical practitioner, and proved in\r\nhundreds of recorded instances; that is to say, by her faith in the\r\nmeans proposed for her cure, wrought to the highest pitch by her\r\nreligion, and by the assurances of those to whom she was accustomed to\r\ndefer. We think, nevertheless, that the publication of this ‘case of\r\nWinefrid White,’ savors strongly of religious empiricism, and is exactly\r\nanalogous to the ‘cases of cure’ which we every day see advertised in\r\nall the newspapers. We refrain from treating the subject theologically,\r\nyet it appears to us that Matthew xxiv. 24, proves that ‘signs and\r\nwonders’ are not only no evidence of divine interposition, but may be\r\nused even by ‘false prophets, so as to deceive the very elect.’ The\r\ncontinuance of miraculous powers will be found, we suspect, to depend on\r\nother circumstances than the date of the year. They disappear wherever\r\nthe printing-press begins to be freely used, and, by its agency, fixes\r\nall the circumstances that attend them; and they still continue to\r\nflourish wherever the history of the circumstances depends for any\r\nperiod on traditional evidence. Miracles are, therefore, performed in\r\nabundance, even in our days, among the negroes, the Hottentots, the\r\nCaffres, the Tartars, the South Sea islanders, and the Indians of the\r\ntwo Americas. The last we believe on record are to be found in the Hon.\r\nM. Elphinstone’s published embassy to Cabul in 1808: he states that the\r\nsick were carried after him many days’ journey; and, at page\r\ntwenty-eight, he says: ‘Some thought we could raise the dead; and there\r\nwas a story current, that we had made and animated a wooden ram at\r\nMooltaun; that we had sold him as a ram; and that it was not till the\r\npurchaser began to eat him, that the material of which he was made was\r\ndiscovered.’ We forbear to press the subject further.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                              WIGAN WELL.\r\n\r\nAbout a mile from Wigan, in Lancashire, is a spring, the water of which\r\nburns like oil. On applying a lighted candle to the surface, a large\r\nflame is suddenly produced, and burns vigorously. A dishful of water\r\nhaving been taken up at the part whence the flame issues, and a lighted\r\ncandle held to it, the flame goes out; notwithstanding which the water\r\nin this part boils and rises up like water in a pot on the fire, but\r\ndoes not feel warm on introducing the hand. What is still more\r\nextraordinary, on making a dam, and preventing the flowing of fresh\r\nwater to the ignited part, that which was already there having been\r\ndrained away, a burning candle being applied to the surface of the dry\r\nearth at the same point where the water before burned, the fumes take\r\nfire, and burn with a resplendent light, the cone of the flame ascending\r\na foot and a half from the surface of the earth. It is not discolored,\r\nlike that of sulphureous bodies, neither has it any manifest smell, nor\r\ndo the fumes, in their ascent, betray any sensible heat. The latter\r\nunquestionably consist of inflammable air, or hydrogen gas; and it ought\r\nto be observed that the whole of the country about Wigan, for the\r\ncompass of several miles, is underlaid with coal. This phenomenon may\r\ntherefore be referred to the same cause which occasioned the dreadful\r\nexplosion of Felling colliery; but in the present case, this destructive\r\ngas, instead of being pent up in the bowels of the earth, accompanies\r\nthe water in its passage to the surface.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    DROPPING WELL AT KNARESBOROUGH.\r\n\r\nThis dropping well, or petrifying spring, rises at the foot of a\r\nlimestone rock, at an inconsiderable distance from the bank of the river\r\nNidd. The spring, after running about sixty feet, divides, and spreads\r\nitself over the top of the rock, whence it trickles very fast, from\r\nthirty or forty places, into a channel hollowed for the purpose, as seen\r\nin the cut, each drop producing a musical kind of tinkling, probably\r\nowing to the concavity of the rock, which, bending in a circular\r\nprojection from the bottom to the top, occasions its brow to overhang\r\nabout fifteen feet. This rock, which is about thirty feet in hight,\r\nforty-eight in length, and from thirty to fifty in breadth, started, in\r\nthe year 1704, from the common bank, and left a chasm, from five to nine\r\nfeet wide, over which the water passes by an aqueduct formed for the\r\npurpose. It is clothed with evergreen and other shrubs, which add\r\ngreatly to the beauty of this very interesting scene.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DROPPING WELL AT KNARESBOROUGH.]\r\n\r\nThe water is said to abound with fine particles of a nitrous earth,\r\nwhich it deposits, but when in a languid motion only, and leaves its\r\nincrustations on the leaves, moss, &c., which it meets with, in\r\ntrickling thus slowly through the cavities of the rock. This spring is\r\nestimated to send forth twenty gallons of water in a minute. Here are to\r\nbe seen pieces of moss, bird’s nests with their eggs, and a variety of\r\nother objects, some of them very curious which have been incrusted or\r\npetrified by the water.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            BROSELEY SPRING.\r\n\r\nThis celebrated boiling spring, or well, at Broseley, in Shropshire, was\r\ndiscovered in the month of June, 1711. It was first announced by a\r\nterrible noise in the night, there having been a remarkable\r\nthunder-storm. Several persons who resided in the vicinity having been\r\nawakened in their beds by this loud and rumbling noise, arose, and\r\nproceeding to a bog under a small hill, about two hundred yards from the\r\nriver Severn, perceived a surprising commotion and shaking of the earth,\r\nand a little boiling up of water through the grass. They took a spade,\r\nand digging up a portion of the earth, the water immediately flew up to\r\na great hight, and was set on fire by a candle which was presented to\r\nit. To prevent the spring from being destroyed, an iron cistern has been\r\nplaced over it, provided with a cover, and a hole in the center, through\r\nwhich the water may be viewed. If a lighted candle, or any burning\r\nsubstance, be presented to this aperture, the water instantly takes\r\nfire, and burns like spirit of wine, continuing to do so as long as the\r\nair is kept from it; but on removing the cover of the cistern, it\r\nquickly goes out. The apparent boiling and ascent of the water of this\r\nspring, are still more obviously the result of hydrogen gas, or\r\ninflammable air, than in the preceding instance of Wigan well.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      HOT SPRINGS OF ST. MICHAEL.\r\n\r\nIn the eastern part of this island, (one of the Azores,) is a round,\r\ndeep valley surrounded by high mountains, in which are many hot springs;\r\nbut the most remarkable is that called the Caldeira, situated in the\r\neastern part of the valley on a small eminence by the side of a river,\r\non which is a basin about thirty feet in diameter, where the water\r\ncontinually boils with prodigious fury. A few yards distant from it, is\r\na cavern in the side of a bank, in which the water boils in a dreadful\r\nmanner, throwing out a thick, muddy, unctuous water, several yards from\r\nits mouth, with a hideous noise. In the middle of the river are several\r\nplaces where the water boils with so intense a heat, that a person can\r\nnot dip his finger into it without being scalded. On its banks are\r\nseveral apertures, out of which the steam rises to a considerable hight,\r\nand is so hot that it can not be approached by the hand. In other parts,\r\nthe spectator would be led to suppose that the bellows of a hundred\r\nforges were blowing in concert; while sulphureous streams issue out in a\r\nthousand places. The bushes even, near these spots, are covered with\r\npure brimstone, condensed from the steam which issues from the ground.\r\nIn the small caverns whence the steam issues, many of the inhabitants\r\nprepare their food.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       HOT SPRINGS OF THE TROAD.\r\n\r\nThe Troad, a country of Phrygia, in Asia Minor, of which Troy was the\r\ncapital, abounds with hot springs; the most interesting one of which is\r\nthus described by Doctor Clarke. It is situated near a place called\r\nBonarbashy, signifying literally “the head of the springs,” and gushes\r\nperpendicularly out of the earth, rising from the bottom of a marble and\r\ngranite reservoir, and throwing up as much water as the famous fountain\r\nof Holywell, in Wales. Its surface seems vehemently boiling; and, during\r\ncold weather, the condensed vapor above it causes the appearance of a\r\ncloud of smoke over the well. While the mercury stood at forty-six\r\ndegrees in the open air, it rose, when the thermometer was plunged in\r\nthe water, to sixty-two degrees. Notwithstanding the warmth of this\r\nspring, fishes were seen sporting in the reservoir. In every part of the\r\ndistrict through which the Mender flows, from Ida to the Hellespont, are\r\nmany of these springs, of different degrees of temperature.\r\n\r\nThe Geysers have already been described, in treating of Mount Hecla, and\r\nits surprising volcano. In following up the details of the phenomena of\r\nthis nature given above, by a brief notice of other bubbling, tepid and\r\nboiling springs, it may not be improper to premise that heat, water and\r\nvapors of various kinds, exist in prodigious quantities beneath the\r\nsurface of the earth; and frequently, as has been seen in the phenomena\r\nof volcanoes and earthquakes, burst forth from enormous openings, with\r\ntremendous destruction. It often happens, however, that the openings are\r\nsmall and porous, and that the vapors ascending through them, are simply\r\ncombined with water. Hence that almost infinite variety in the\r\ncharacters of these springs, fountains and lakes, the waters of which\r\nare combined with extraneous substances. In some cases the clastic\r\ngases, or vapors, ascend from specific levity alone, and are destitute\r\nof all taste and odor; insomuch that springs are found which bubble\r\nwithout boiling, or betraying heat or any other foreign quality. In\r\nother cases they are strongly impregnated with heat; and are then either\r\ntepid or boiling, according to the proportion of extricated caloric they\r\ncontain. Occasionally, whether hot or cold, they are blended with\r\nmetallic, sulphureous, saline, and other substances, and hence assume\r\nthe name of mineral waters; while, if the substance thus dissolved be\r\ncombustible, as naphtha, bitumen, or turpentine, the fountain will often\r\ninflame and burn on the application of a lighted torch.\r\n\r\nThe water of the noted boiling spring at Peroul, near Montpelier, is\r\nobserved to heave and boil up very furiously in small bubbles, which\r\nmanifestly proceed from a vapor breaking out of the earth, and rushing\r\nthrough the water, so as to throw it up with noise, and in many bubbles;\r\nfor on digging in the vicinity of the ditch where the spring lies, and\r\npouring fresh water on the dry spot newly dug, the same boiling is\r\nimmediately observed. A similar bubbling of the water is likewise found\r\nnear Peroul, on the seashore. In several dry places near the spring, are\r\nsmall ventiducts, passages or clefts, whence steam issues; and at the\r\nmouths of these passages, small light bodies, such as feathers, pieces\r\nof straw, leaves, &c., being placed, are soon blown away. This vapor, on\r\nthe application of a lighted candle or torch, does not flame or take\r\nfire, as is the case with that of the boiling spring at Wigan; so that\r\nthere are two different sorts of steam, to occasion these boilings, at\r\nthe same time that neither of the fountains is medicinal, or even warm.\r\n\r\nOther boiling waters, of a very different temperature, possess, like\r\nthose of the hot springs of St. Michael, a sufficient degree of heat to\r\nboil eggs, and to serve for other culinary purposes. Among these may be\r\ninstanced those of the Solfatara, near Naples; those on the summit of\r\nMount Zebio, in the Modenese territory; and those which constitute the\r\nsource of the imperial bath at Aix la Chapelle. In Japan, a hot spring\r\nis said to burst forth which constantly maintains the boiling-point, and\r\nthe water of which retains its heat much longer than common water. It\r\ndoes not flow regularly, but during an interval of two hours each day;\r\nand the force and violence of the vapors are then so great, that large\r\nstones are ejected, and raised to the hight of ten or twelve feet, with\r\na noise like that of the explosion of a piece of artillery.\r\n\r\nFrom the phenomena which have been adduced, it appears that the\r\nexhalations constantly escaping from the vast subterraneous magazines in\r\nwhich they are prepared, vary greatly in their qualities and effects.\r\nSome are cold and dry, resembling air or wind, as those near Peroul, and\r\nin the cavities of mountains, especially those of Æolus and other hills\r\nof Italy, as well as in particular mines. Others are inflammable, and of\r\na bituminous nature, though not positively warm, as those of Wigan well.\r\nOthers are very hot, sulphureous and saline, more especially those of\r\nthe natural stoves, sweating-vaults, grottos, baths and volcanoes near\r\nNaples, Baiæ, Cuma and Pozzuoli, as also in some of the subterraneous\r\nworks at Rome. And others, again, are of an arsenical, or other noxious\r\nquality, as those of the Grotta del Cane. Now, these various streams\r\nmeeting with, and running through water, must occasion in it a great\r\nvariety of phenomena and effects.\r\n\r\nIt is observed by Doctor Thomson, in his history of the Royal Society,\r\nthat the hot spring at Bath, has continued at a temperature higher than\r\nthat of the air for a period of not less than two thousand years,\r\nalthough it is so far distant from any volcano, that, without a very\r\nviolent and improbable extension of the agency of volcanic fires, it can\r\nnot be ascribed to them. There are various decompositions of mineral\r\nbodies, which generate considerable heat; or, to speak more properly,\r\nwater is itself the decomposed substance generating heat by its\r\ndecomposition. The evolution of azotic gas is a proof that the heat of\r\nthe Bath waters is owing to a particular decomposition which takes place\r\nwithin the bowels of the earth. The greatest heat of these waters is one\r\nhundred and sixteen degrees of Fahrenheit’s scale; but that of the\r\nmineral waters of Carlsbad, in Bohemia, ascends to one hundred and\r\nsixty-five degrees.\r\n\r\nThere are several curious springs which are worthy of notice in this\r\nconnection, though somewhat varying from the class thus far mentioned.\r\nOne of these was recently discovered in California, about fifty miles\r\neast of San Felipe, in San Diego county. It was discovered by a party\r\nengaged in surveying the public lands, and consists of a collection of\r\nfountains or springs of soda water, situated in a sandy plain or\r\ndepression of the surface of the desert. The spring is in a mound of\r\nsymmetrical shape, tapering like a sugar-loaf, in the center of the top\r\nof which is a hole, apparently unfathomable, containing the carbonated\r\nbeverage fresh from some natural laboratory below. Some of these mounds\r\nare six feet high, and clothed with a green and luxuriant coat of grass,\r\nwhile others are shaped like an inverted bowl, and fringed by a growth\r\nof cane. The water is described as having the same sparkling and\r\neffervescing quality as that ordinarily sold by apothecaries, and was\r\ndrunk with avidity by both the men and animals belonging to the party\r\ndiscovering it. When impregnated with acid of any kind, it produced\r\ninstant effervescence, and in that form was peculiarly refreshing as a\r\ndrink.\r\n\r\nAnother singular spring has also been discovered on the way from the\r\nGreat Salt lake, to Los Angelos, through the Cajon pass. The traveler\r\nwho gives the account of it says: “We had crossed the great desert\r\nwithout any accident, and then camped on a stream of deliciously cool\r\nwater, about twelve to eighteen inches wide, which distributes itself\r\nabout half a mile lower down in a meadow covered with luxuriant grasses.\r\nThis camp-ground is called by the Spaniards, ‘Las Vegas.’ Once more we\r\nhad plenty of grass for our fatigued animals, and we determined to rest\r\nhere for the day. During our journey we passed a number of deserted\r\nwagons, chairs, &c. An ox-train from Little Salt lake had preceded about\r\nten days; and it was not difficult to follow their trail, for in the\r\nspace of one hour I counted the putrid carcasses of nineteen oxen and\r\nhorses. What a lesson to those who venture on such a journey unadvisedly\r\nand unprepared! The strong north wind which blew all day, raised a cloud\r\nof dust which almost blinded me, although I had goggles and a green vail\r\nto protect my eyes; however, the delightful and refreshing water of this\r\noasis soon purified me; and I felt, having crossed the desert,\r\nbreakfasted and bathed, much more comfortable, both mentally and\r\nphysically. The acacia was the only tree on this stream. Having remained\r\nat this camp all one day, the next morning we were on the road to\r\nCottonwood springs, some twenty miles distant, where we would find water\r\nand grass, and then commence a journey over another desert of fifty-five\r\nmiles. We followed up this little stream for about three miles, when the\r\nroad turned a little to the right; but I was anxious to see the head of\r\nthe stream, for, from the appearance of the surrounding country, I\r\njudged it to be very near. Several gentlemen and myself continued up the\r\nstream, and after a ride of half a mile, we came to a large spring,\r\nthirty-five feet wide and forty long, surrounded by acacias in full\r\nbloom. We approached through an opening, and found it to contain the\r\nclearest and most delicious water I ever tasted; the bottom appeared to\r\nbe not more than two feet from the surface, and to consist of white\r\nsand. One of the party prepared himself for a bath, and soon his body\r\ndivided the crystal waters. While I was considering whether I should go\r\nin, I heard him calling to me that it was impossible to sink, the water\r\nwas so buoyant. I hardly believed it, and, to be able to speak\r\ncertainly, I also undressed and jumped in. What was my delight and\r\nastonishment to find that all my efforts to sink were futile. I raised\r\nmy body out of the water, and suddenly lowered myself, but I bounded\r\nupward as if I had struck a springing-board; I walked about the water up\r\nto my armpits, just the same as if I had been walking on dry land. The\r\nwater instead of being about two feet deep, was over fifteen, the length\r\nof the longest tent-pole we had along. It is impossible for a man to\r\nsink over his head in it; the sand on the banks is very fine and white;\r\nthe temperature is seventy-eight degrees of Fahrenheit. I can form no\r\nidea as to the cause of this singular phenomenon. Great Salt lake also\r\npossesses this quality, but this water is perfectly sweet. In the\r\nabsence of any other name I have called it Buoyant spring. I have never\r\nheard of it as possessing this quality, and should like some of the\r\nsavants to explain the cause of buoyancy. We lingered in the spring for\r\nfifteen minutes, when we dressed and resumed our ride, highly delighted\r\nand gratified by our exploration. I made drawings of this spot and\r\nsurrounding mountains.”\r\n\r\nStill another singular spring, also in California, was discovered by a\r\nMr. Dabney, when boring for water in San Jose. The auger penetrated\r\nthrough a stiff bed of clay fifty-eight feet thick, when a stream of\r\nwater was struck which forced itself up the aperture with unprecedented\r\npower, and in a volume greater, it is believed, than all the other\r\nartesian streams in the neighborhood combined. From this well alone\r\nflowed a sufficiency of water to turn a mill. It boiled up with great\r\nforce, and ran off in a stream four feet wide and six inches deep. At\r\nthe mouth the current washed out a hole of several feet wide and very\r\ndeep. Serious apprehensions were entertained, when the stream first\r\nburst forth, that it would be impossible to control it. The water was\r\ncold and delightful, and it was estimated that the spring would be\r\nsufficient to supply the whole city plentifully.\r\n\r\nReciprocating fountains, or springs, may be cited among the most curious\r\nphenomena of nature. An irregularity of flow is not uncommon in boiling\r\nsprings; but there are other springs which evince a periodical influx\r\nand reflux, almost as regular as the tides of the ocean. These changes,\r\nit will be seen, frequently occur several times in a day, or even in an\r\nhour. They are ascribed to various causes, either subterraneous or\r\nsuperficial; but in general, springs and lakes of this description, have\r\nbeen ascertained to communicate with others beneath, through pores or\r\napertures of various diameters, which serve equally to carry off the\r\nwaters, and to supply them afresh. In such cases the flux and reflux of\r\nthe upper head of water, must necessarily depend on the state of that\r\nbeneath; and the causes which alternately augment and diminish the\r\nlatter, must produce a similar effect on the former.\r\n\r\nPaderborn spring, in Westphalia, disappears twice in twenty-four hours,\r\nreturning constantly, after a lapse of six hours, with a great noise,\r\nand so forcibly as to drive three mills at a short distance from its\r\nsource. The inhabitants call it the _bolderborn_, that is, the\r\nboisterous spring. Lay-well spring, near Torbay, is about six feet in\r\nlength, five in breadth, and nearly six inches deep. The flux and\r\nreflux, which are very visible, are performed in about two minutes; when\r\nthe spring remains at its lowest ebb for the space of about three\r\nminutes. In this way it ebbs and flows twenty times within the hour. As\r\nsoon as the water begins to rise, many bubbles ascend from the bottom;\r\nbut on its falling, the bubbling instantly ceases. Giggleswick spring,\r\nin the West Riding of Yorkshire, lies at the foot of a hill of\r\nlimestone, named Giggleswick Scar. Its reciprocations are irregular,\r\nboth with respect to duration and magnitude, the interval of time\r\nbetween any two succeeding flows being sometimes greater, and at other\r\ntimes less, insomuch that a just standard of comparison can not be\r\nformed. The rise of the water, in the stone trough or cistern which\r\nreceives it, during the time of the well’s flowing, is equally\r\nuncertain, varying from one inch to nine or ten inches, in the course of\r\na few reciprocations. This spring, like the preceding one, discharges\r\nbubbles of air at the time of its flowing. Near the lake of Bourget, in\r\nSavoy, is a reciprocating spring which rises and falls with a great\r\nnoise, but not at stated and regular times. After Easter, its ebbings\r\nand flowings are frequently perceived six times in an hour; but in dry\r\nseasons not more than once or twice. It issues from a rock, and is\r\ncalled =La Fontaine de Merville=, the marvelous fountain.\r\n\r\n\r\n              -------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n                      BITUMINOUS AND OTHER LAKES.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        PITCH LAKE OF TRINIDAD.\r\n\r\nNear Point la Braye, (Tar point,) the name assigned to it on account of\r\nits characteristic feature, in the island of Trinidad, is a lake which\r\nat the first view appears to be an expanse of still water, but which, on\r\na nearer approach, is found to be an extensive plain of mineral pitch,\r\nwith frequent crevices and chasms filled with water. On its being\r\nvisited in the autumnal season, the singularity of the scene was so\r\ngreat, that it required some time for the spectators to recover\r\nthemselves from their surprise, so as to examine it minutely. The\r\nsurface of the lake was of an ash color, and not polished or smooth, so\r\nas to be slippery, but of such a consistence as to bear any weight. It\r\nwas not adhesive, although it received in part the impression of the\r\nfoot, and could be trodden without any tremulous motion, several head of\r\ncattle browsing on it in perfect security. In the summer season,\r\nhowever, the surface is much more yielding, and in a state approaching\r\nto fluidity, as is evidenced by pieces of wood and other substances,\r\nthrown upon it, having been found enveloped in it. Even large branches\r\nof trees, which were a foot above the level, had, in some way, become\r\nenveloped in the bituminous matter. The interstices, or chasms, are very\r\nnumerous, ramifying and joining in every direction; and being filled\r\nwith water in the wet season, present the only obstacle to walking over\r\nthe surface. These cavities are in general deep in proportion to their\r\nwidth, and many of them unfathomable: the water they contain is\r\nuncontaminated by the pitch, and is the abode of a variety of fishes.\r\nThe arrangement of the chasms is very singular, the sides invariably\r\nshelving from the surface, so as nearly to meet at the bottom, and then\r\nbulging out toward each other with a considerable degree of convexity.\r\nSeveral of them have been known to close up entirely, without leaving\r\nany mark or seam.\r\n\r\nThe pitch lake of Trinidad contains many islets covered with grass and\r\nshrubs, which are the haunts of birds of the most exquisite plumage. Its\r\nprecise extent can not, any more than its depth, be readily ascertained,\r\nthe line between it and the neighboring soil not being well defined; but\r\nits main body may be estimated at three miles in circumference. It is\r\nbounded on the north and west sides by the sea, on the south by a rocky\r\neminence, and on the east by the usual argillaceous soil of the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           MUD LAKE OF JAVA.\r\n\r\nThe following details relative to the volcanic springs of boiling mud in\r\nJava are extracted from the Penang Gazette.\r\n\r\nHaving received an account of a wonderful phenomenon in the plains of\r\nGrobogna, a party set off, from Solo, in September, 1814, to examine it.\r\nOn approaching the place, they saw what at first appeared like the surf\r\nbreaking over the rocks, with a heavy spray falling to the leeward.\r\nAlighting, they went to the “Bluddugs,” as the Javanese call them, which\r\nthey found to be an elevated plain of mud, about two miles in\r\ncircumference, in the center of which immense bodies of soft mud were\r\nthrown up to the hight of ten or fifteen feet, in the form of large\r\nbubbles, which bursting, emitted great volumes of dense white smoke. The\r\nlargest bubbles, of which there were two, rose and burst some seven or\r\neight times a minute, throwing up from one to three tuns of mud, the\r\nsmell of the smoke from which was very offensive, like the washings of a\r\ngun-barrel. It was both difficult and dangerous to go near the large\r\nbubbles, as the surface, except where it had been hardened by the sun,\r\nwas all a quagmire. They went, however, close to a small bubble, (the\r\nplain was full of them, of all sizes,) and observed it for some time. It\r\nappeared to heave and swell, and when the air within had raised it to\r\nsome hight, it burst, and the mud fell down in concentric circles, and\r\nthen remained quiet till again it was raised, again to burst; which was\r\nat intervals of from one to two minutes. The water drained from the mud\r\nwas collected by the Javanese, and being exposed to the sun deposited\r\ncrystals of salt.\r\n\r\nNext morning the party rode to a place in the forest, to view a salt\r\nlake, a mud hillock, and various boiling pools. The lake was about half\r\na mile in circumference, of dirty-looking water, boiling up all over in\r\ngurgling eddies; the water being cold, bitter and salt, with an\r\noffensive smell. The mud hillock, which was near, was about fifteen feet\r\nhigh, in the form of a cone, with a base of eighty, and a top of eight\r\nfeet diameter. The top was open, and the interior, which was full of\r\nboiling and heaving mud, was found to be eleven fathoms deep. Every rise\r\nof the mud was attended by a rumbling noise from within; and the mud was\r\nmore liquid than at the bluddugs, and unattended by smoke. Near the foot\r\nof this hillock was a small pool of water, like that of the lake,\r\nboiling violently; and some two hundred yards distant, two larger pools\r\nor springs of the same general description, the smell of which was very\r\noffensive, and the boiling of which could be heard at quite a distance,\r\nresembling the noise of a small waterfall. The water both of the\r\nbluddugs and of the lake, is used medicinally by the Javanese, and also,\r\nas stated above, for the making of salt, which is gathered in\r\nconsiderable quantities, and the government income from which adds not a\r\nlittle to the public revenues. The general cause of the phenomena here\r\nwitnessed, is supposed, beyond all question, to be volcanic; the salt\r\nwater being thrown up by this agency in a heated state, and thus\r\nmingling with the soil to produce the boiling and heaving mud above\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           SALT LAKE OF UTAH.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving the subject of lakes, springs, &c., we must not omit to\r\nmention the Great Salt lake of Utah territory, which has been gazed upon\r\nwith interest by many an emigrant, passing with his family, as\r\nrepresented in the following cut, to his far western home. This lake\r\nlies in a region abounding with scenery of unrivaled magnificence and\r\nbeauty. “Descend from the mountains,” says a late writer, “where you\r\nhave the scenery and climate of Switzerland, to seek the sky of your\r\nchoice among the many climates of Italy, and you may find, welling out\r\nof the same hills, the freezing springs of Mexico, and the hot springs\r\nof Iceland, both together coursing their way to the great salt sea in\r\nthe plain below. The pages of Malte Brun provide me with a less truthful\r\nparallel to it, than those which describe the happy valley of Rasselas,\r\nor the continent of Balnibarbi. In the midst of this interesting region,\r\nthe most remarkable object is the Great Salt lake: which, in the\r\nsaltness of its waters, in the circumstance of its having no outlet, and\r\nbeing fed from another and smaller lake of fresh water, (with which it\r\nis connected by a stream which has appropriately been called the\r\nJordan,) and in the rugged character of some portions of the surrounding\r\nregion, bears a remarkable resemblance to the Dead sea of Palestine.\r\nInstead, however, of lying one thousand feet below, it is more than four\r\nthousand feet above the level of the sea; and its waters, being an\r\nalmost pure solution of common salt, are free from the pungent and\r\nnauseous taste which characterizes those of the Dead sea. This lake is\r\nabout seventy miles long, and thirty miles wide, and is so intensely\r\nsalt that no living thing can exist in it; and by evaporation in hot\r\nweather, it leaves on its shores a thick incrustation of salt.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE EMIGRANT FAMILY.]\r\n\r\nSome twenty-five miles south of this, and connected with it by the river\r\nJordan, as mentioned above, is Utah lake, a body of fresh water, some\r\nthirty-five miles in length, which abounds with trout and other fish.\r\nAnd some seven hundred feet higher still, is Pyramid lake, on the slope\r\nof the Sierra Nevada mountains, so named from a singular pyramidal mount\r\nrising from its transparent waters to the hight of some six hundred\r\nfeet; and walled in by almost perpendicular precipices, in some places\r\nthree thousand feet high. Some distance from here, too, are the _boiling\r\nsprings_, described by Fremont, the largest basin of which is several\r\nhundred feet in circumference, and has a circular space at one end some\r\nfifteen feet in diameter, entirely occupied with the boiling water. A\r\npole sixteen feet in length, was entirely submerged on thrusting it down\r\nnear the center; and the temperature of the water near the edge was two\r\nhundred and six degrees. In this vicinity also, are appearances similar\r\nto the _mirages_ of the great deserts of the old world. In traveling\r\nover the salt deserts of the Fremont basin, his party saw themselves\r\nreflected in the air, probably, as Fremont himself suggests, from the\r\nsaline particles floating in the atmosphere, and in some way affecting\r\nits refracting power. The entire region, is one of great wildness and\r\ngrandeur.\r\n\r\n\r\n              -------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n                        ATMOSPHERICAL PHENOMENA.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  ------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n                                METEORS.\r\n\r\n           From look to look, contagious through the crowd\r\n           The panic runs, and into wond’rous shapes\r\n           The appearance throws: armies in meet array,\r\n           Thronged with aerial spears and steeds of fire;\r\n           Till the long lines of full-extended war\r\n           In bleeding fight commixt, the sanguine flood\r\n           Rolls a broad slaughter o’er the plains of heaven.\r\n           As thus they scan the visionary scene,\r\n           On all sides swells the superstitious din.\r\n           Incontinent; and busy frenzy talks\r\n           Of blood and battle; cities overturned,\r\n           And late at night in swallowing earthquake sunk,\r\n           Or hideous wrapt in fierce ascending flame;\r\n           Of sallow famine, inundation, storm;\r\n           Of pestilence, and every great distress;\r\n           Empires subversed, when ruling fate has struck\r\n           The unalterable hour: even nature’s self\r\n           Is deemed to totter on the brink of time.\r\n           Not so the man of philosophic eye,\r\n           And aspect sage; the waving brightness he\r\n           Curious surveys, inquisitive to know\r\n           The causes, and materials, yet unfixed,\r\n           Of this appearance beautiful and new.—THOMSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe nature of those splendid phenomena of the heavens which are embraced\r\nunder the general term meteors, can not be so well elucidated as by an\r\nextract from the travels of Messrs. Humboldt and Bonpland to the\r\nequinoctial regions of the new continent. The sublime wonders described\r\nby the former of these travelers were witnessed by them at Cumana, a\r\ncity of Venezuela, in South America.\r\n\r\n“The night of the eleventh of November, 1779, was cool and extremely\r\nbeautiful. Toward the morning, from half after two, the most\r\nextraordinary luminous meteors were seen toward the east. M. Bonpland,\r\nwho had risen to enjoy the freshness of the air in the gallery,\r\nperceived them first. Thousands of bolides (fire-balls) and falling\r\nstars, succeeded each other during four hours. Their direction was very\r\nregular, from north to south. They filled a space in the sky extending\r\nfrom the true east thirty degrees toward the north and south. In an\r\namplitude of sixty degrees the meteors were seen to rise above the\r\nhorizon at east-north-east, and at east to describe arcs more or less\r\nextended, falling toward the south, after having followed the direction\r\nof the meridian. Some of them attained a hight of forty degrees; and all\r\nexceeded twenty-five or thirty degrees. There was very little wind in\r\nthe low regions of the atmosphere, and this blew from the east. No trace\r\nof clouds was to be seen. M. Bonpland relates, that from the beginning\r\nof the phenomenon, there was not a space in the firmament equal in\r\nextent to three diameters of the moon which was not filled at every\r\ninstant with bolides and falling stars. The first were fewer in number,\r\nbut as they were seen of different sizes, it was impossible to fix the\r\nlimit between these two classes of phenomena. All these meteors left\r\nluminous traces from five to ten degrees in length, as often happens in\r\nthe equinoctial regions. The phosphorescence of these traces, or\r\nluminous bands, lasted seven or eight seconds. Many of the falling stars\r\nhad a very distinct nucleus, as large as the disk of Jupiter, from which\r\ndarted sparks of vivid light. The bolides seemed to burst as by\r\nexplosion; but the largest, those from one degree to one degree and\r\nfifteen minutes in diameter, disappeared without scintillation, leaving\r\nbehind them phosphorescent bands (_trabes_) exceeding in breadth fifteen\r\nor twenty minutes, or sixtieth parts of a degree. The light of these\r\nmeteors was white, and not reddish, which must be attributed, no doubt,\r\nto the absence of vapors, and the extreme transparency of the air. For\r\nthe same reason, under the tropics, the stars of the first magnitude\r\nhave, at their rising, a light evidently whiter than in Europe.\r\n\r\n“Almost all the inhabitants of Cumana were witnesses of this phenomenon,\r\nand did not behold these bolides with indifference; the oldest among\r\nthem remembered, that the great earthquakes of 1766 were preceded by\r\nsimilar phenomena. The fishermen in the suburbs asserted, that the\r\nfire-work had begun at one o’clock; and that, as they returned from\r\nfishing in the gulf, they had already perceived very small falling stars\r\ntoward the east. They affirmed at the same time, that igneous meteors\r\nwere extremely rare on those coasts after two in the morning.\r\n\r\n“The phenomenon ceased by degrees after four o’clock, and the bolides\r\nand falling stars became less frequent; but we still distinguished some\r\ntoward the north-east, by their whitish light, and the rapidity of their\r\nmovement, a quarter of an hour after sunrise. This circumstance will\r\nappear less extraordinary, when I state that in full daylight, in 1788,\r\nthe interior of the houses in the town of Popayan was highly illumined\r\nby an aerolite of immense magnitude. It passed over the town when the\r\nsun was shining clearly, about one o’clock. M. Bonpland and myself,\r\nduring our second residence at Cumana, after having observed on the\r\ntwenty-sixth of September, 1800, the immersion of the first satellite of\r\nJupiter, succeeded in seeing the planet distinctly with the naked eye,\r\neighteen minutes after the disk of the sun had appeared in the horizon.\r\nThere was a very slight vapor in the east, but Jupiter appeared on an\r\nazure sky. These facts prove the extreme purity and transparency of the\r\natmosphere under the torrid zone. The _mass_ of diffused light is so\r\nmuch less, as the vapors are more perfectly dissolved. The same cause\r\nthat weakens the diffusion of the solar light, diminishes the extinction\r\nof that which emanates either from a bolis, Jupiter, or the moon, seen\r\non the second day after her conjunction.\r\n\r\n“The researches of M. Chladni having singularly fixed the attention of\r\nthe scientific world upon the bolides and falling stars, at my departure\r\nfrom Europe, we did not neglect during the course of our journey from\r\nCaraccas to the Rio Negro, to inquire everywhere, whether the meteors of\r\nthe twelfth of November had been perceived. In the savage country, where\r\nthe greater number of the inhabitants sleep out in the air, so\r\nextraordinary a phenomenon could not fail to be remarked, except when\r\nconcealed by clouds from the eye of observation. The Capuchin missionary\r\nat San Fernando de Apura, a village situated amid the savannas of the\r\nprovince of Varinas, and the Franciscan monks stationed near the\r\ncataracts of the Orinoco, and at Maroa, on the banks of the Rio Negro,\r\nhad seen numberless falling stars and bolides illumine the vault of\r\nheaven. Maroa is south-west of Cumana, and one hundred and seventy-four\r\nleagues’ distance. All these observers compared the phenomenon to a\r\nbeautiful fire-work, which had lasted from three till six in the\r\nmorning. Some of the monks had marked the day upon their ritual; others\r\nhad noted it by the nearest festivals of the church. Unfortunately, none\r\nof them could recollect the direction of the meteors, or their apparent\r\nhight. From the position of the mountains and thick forest which\r\nsurround the missions of the cataracts and the little village of Maroa,\r\nI presume that the bolides were still visible at twenty degrees above\r\nthe horizon. On my arrival at the southern extremity of Spanish Guiana,\r\nat the little fort of San Carlos, I found a party of Portuguese, who had\r\ngone up the Rio Negro from the mission of St. Joseph of the Maravitains,\r\nand who assured me, that in that part of Brazil, the phenomenon had been\r\nperceived, at least as far as San Gabriel das Cachoeiras, consequently\r\nas far as the equator itself.\r\n\r\n“I was powerfully struck at the immense hight which these bolides must\r\nhave attained, to have been visible at the same time at Cumana, and on\r\nthe frontiers of Brazil, in a line of two hundred and thirty leagues in\r\nlength. But what was my astonishment, when at my return to Europe, I\r\nlearned that the same phenomenon had been perceived, on an extent of the\r\nglobe of sixty-four degrees of latitude, and ninety-one degrees of\r\nlongitude; at the equator, in South America, at Labrador, and in\r\nGermany! I found accidentally, during my passage from Philadelphia to\r\nBordeaux, in the memoirs of the Pennsylvanian society, the corresponding\r\nobservations of Mr. Ellicott (latitude thirty degrees, forty-two\r\nminutes;) and, upon my return from Naples to Berlin, I read the account\r\nof the Moravian missionaries among the Esquimaux, in the library of\r\nGöttingen. Several philosophers had already discussed at this period the\r\ncoincidence of the observation in the north with those at Cumana, which\r\nM. Bonpland and I had published in 1800.\r\n\r\n“The following is a succinct enumeration of facts. First, the fiery\r\nmeteors were seen in the east, and the east-north-east, to forty degrees\r\nof elevation, from two to six hours at Cumana, (latitude ten degrees,\r\ntwenty-seven minutes, fifty-two seconds, longitude sixty-six degrees,\r\nthirty minutes;) at Porto Cabello, (latitude ten degrees, six minutes,\r\nfifty-two seconds, longitude sixty-seven degrees, five minutes;) and on\r\nthe frontiers of Brazil, near the equator, in the longitude of seventy\r\ndegrees west of the meridian of Paris. Secondly, in French Guiana,\r\n(latitude four degrees, fifty-six minutes, longitude fifty-four degrees,\r\nthirty-five minutes,) the northern part of the sky was seen all on fire.\r\nInnumerable falling stars traversed the heavens during an hour and a\r\nhalf, and diffused so vivid a light, that those meteors might be\r\ncompared to the blazing sheaves shot out from fire-works. Thirdly, Mr.\r\nEllicott, an astronomer in the United States, having terminated his\r\ntrigonometric operations for the rectification of the limits on the\r\nOhio, being, on the twelfth of November, in the gulf of Florida, in the\r\nlatitude of twenty-five degrees, and longitude eighty-one degrees, fifty\r\nminutes, saw, in all parts of the sky, ‘as many meteors as stars, moving\r\nin all directions: some appeared to fall perpendicularly; and it was\r\nexpected every minute that they would drop into the vessel.’ The same\r\nphenomenon was perceived upon the American continent as far as the\r\nlatitude of thirty degrees, forty-two minutes. Fourthly, in Labrador, at\r\nNain (latitude fifty-six degrees, fifty-five minutes) and Hoffenthal\r\n(latitude fifty-eight degrees, four minutes,) and in Greenland, at\r\nLichtenau (latitude sixty-one degrees, five minutes) and New Herrnhutt,\r\n(latitude sixty-four degrees, fourteen minutes, longitude fifty-two\r\ndegrees, twenty minutes,) the Esquimaux were frightened at the enormous\r\nquantity of bolides which fell during twilight toward all points of the\r\nfirmament, some of them being a foot broad. Fifthly, in Germany, M.\r\nZeissing, vicar of Itterstadt, near Weimar, (latitude fifty degrees,\r\nfifty-nine minutes, longitude nine degrees, one minute east,) perceived,\r\non the twelfth of November, between the hours of six and seven in the\r\nmorning, when it was half after two at Cumana, some falling stars, which\r\nshed a very white light. Soon after, toward the south and south-west,\r\nluminous rays appeared from four to six feet long: they were reddish,\r\nand resembled the luminous track of a sky-rocket. During the morning\r\ntwilight, between the hours of seven and eight, the south-west part of\r\nthe sky was seen, from time to time, strongly illuminated by white\r\nlightning, which ran in serpentine lines along the horizon. At night the\r\ncold increased, and the barometer rose.\r\n\r\n“The distance from Weimar to the Rio Negro, is eighteen hundred sea\r\nleagues; and from Rio Negro to Herrnhutt, in Greenland, thirteen hundred\r\nleagues. Admitting that the same fiery meteors were seen at points so\r\ndistant from each other, we must also admit, that their hight was at\r\nleast four hundred and eleven leagues. Near Weimar, the appearance like\r\nsky-rockets was seen in the south and south-east; at Cumana, in the east\r\nand in the east-north-east. We may therefore conclude, that numberless\r\naerolites must have fallen into the sea, between Africa and South\r\nAmerica, to the west of the Cape Verde islands. But, since the direction\r\nof the bolides was not the same at Labrador and at Cumana, why were they\r\nnot perceived in the latter place toward the north, as at Cayenne? I am\r\ninclined to think, that the Chayma Indians of Cumana did not see the\r\nsame bolides as the Portuguese in Brazil, and the missionaries in\r\nLabrador; but, at the same time, it can not be doubted, and this fact\r\nappears to me very remarkable, that in the new world, between the\r\nmeridians of forty-six degrees and eighty-two degrees, between the\r\nequator and sixty-four degrees north, at the same hour, an immense\r\nnumber of bolides and falling stars were perceived; and that those\r\nmeteors had everywhere the same brilliancy, throughout a space of nine\r\nhundred and twenty-one thousand square leagues.\r\n\r\n“The scientific men who have lately made such laborious researches on\r\nfalling stars and their parallaxes, consider them as meteors belonging\r\nto the furthest limits of our atmosphere, between the region of the\r\n=aurora borealis= and that of the lightest clouds. Some have been seen,\r\nwhich had not more than fourteen thousand toises, or about five leagues\r\nof elevation. The highest do not appear to exceed thirty leagues. They\r\nare often more than a hundred feet in diameter; and their swiftness is\r\nsuch, that they dart, in a few seconds, over a space of two leagues.\r\nSome of these have been measured, the direction of which was almost\r\nperpendicularly upward, or forming an angle of fifty degrees with the\r\nvertical line. This extremely remarkable circumstance has led to the\r\nconclusion, that falling stars are aerolites, which, after having\r\nhovered about a long time in space, take fire on entering accidentally\r\ninto our atmosphere, and fall toward the earth.\r\n\r\n“Whatever may be the origin of these luminous meteors, it is difficult\r\nto conceive any instantaneous inflammation taking place in a region\r\nwhere there is less air than in the vacuum of our air-pumps; and where\r\n(twenty-five thousand toises high) the mercury in the barometer would\r\nnot rise to twelve-thousandths of a line. We have ascertained the\r\nuniform mixture of atmospheric air to three-thousandths nearly, only to\r\nan elevation of three thousand toises: consequently, not beyond the last\r\nstratum of fleecy clouds. It might be admitted, that, in the first\r\nrevolutions of the globe, gaseous substances which yet remain unknown to\r\nus, may have risen toward that region, through which the falling stars\r\npass: but accurate experiments, made upon mixtures of gases which have\r\nnot the same specific gravity, prove that we can not admit a superior\r\nstratum of the atmosphere entirely different from the inferior strata.\r\nGaseous substances mix and penetrate each other with the least motion;\r\nand a uniformity of their mixture would have taken place in the lapse of\r\nages, unless we suppose in them the effects of a repulsive action\r\nunexampled in those substances which we can subject to our observations.\r\nFurther, if we admit the existence of a particular aerial fluid in the\r\ninaccessible region of luminous meteors, falling stars, bolides, and the\r\n=aurora borealis=, how can we conceive why the whole stratum of those\r\nfluids does not at once take fire, but that the gaseous emanations, like\r\nthe clouds, occupy only limited spaces? How can we suppose an electrical\r\nexplosion without some vapors collected together, capable of containing\r\nunequal charges of electricity, in air, the mean temperature of which\r\nis, perhaps, twenty-five degrees below the freezing-point of the\r\ncentigrade thermometer, and the rarefaction of which is so considerable,\r\nthat the compression of the electrical shock could scarcely disengage\r\nany heat? These difficulties would in great part, be removed, if the\r\ndirection of the motion of falling stars allowed us to consider them as\r\nbodies with a solid nucleus, as cosmic phenomena (belonging to space\r\nbeyond the limits of our atmosphere) and not as telluric phenomena\r\n(belonging to our planet only.)\r\n\r\n“Supposing that the meteors of Cumana were only at the usual hight at\r\nwhich falling stars in general move, the same meteors were seen above\r\nthe horizon in places more than three hundred and ten leagues distant\r\nfrom each other. Now, what an extraordinary disposition to incandescence\r\nmust have reigned on the twelfth of November, in the higher regions of\r\nthe atmosphere, to have furnished, during four hours, myriads of bolides\r\nand falling stars, visible at the equator, in Greenland, and in Germany.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Benzenberg judiciously observes, that the same cause, which renders\r\nthe phenomenon more frequent, has also an influence on the largeness of\r\nthe meteors, and the intensity of their light. In Europe, the nights\r\nwhen there are the greatest number of falling stars, are those in which\r\nvery bright ones are mixed with very small ones. The periodicalness of\r\nthe phenomenon augments the interest which it excites. There are months,\r\nin which M. Brandes has reckoned in our temperate zone, only sixty or\r\neighty falling stars in one night; and in other months their number has\r\nrisen to two thousand. Whenever one is observed, which has the diameter\r\nof Sirius or of Jupiter, we are sure of seeing so brilliant a meteor\r\nsucceeded by a great number of smaller meteors. If the falling stars be\r\nvery frequent during one night, it is very probable that this frequency\r\nwill continue during several weeks. It would seem that, in the higher\r\nregions of the atmosphere, near that extreme limit where the centrifugal\r\nforce is balanced by gravity, there exists, at regular periods, a\r\nparticular disposition for the production of bolides, falling stars, and\r\nthe =aurora borealis=. Does the periodicalness of this great phenomenon\r\ndepend upon the state of the atmosphere? or upon something which the\r\natmosphere receives from without, while the earth advances in the\r\necliptic? Of all this we are still as ignorant as men were in the days\r\nof Anaxagoras.\r\n\r\n“With respect to the falling stars themselves, it appears to me, from my\r\nown experience, that they are more frequent in the equinoctial regions\r\nthan in the temperate zone; more frequent over the continents, and near\r\ncertain coasts, than in the middle of the ocean. Do the radiation of the\r\nsurface of the globe, and the electrical charge of the lower regions of\r\nthe atmosphere, which varies according to the nature of the soil, and\r\nthe positions of the continents and seas, exert their influence as far\r\nas those hights, where eternal winter reigns? The total absence even of\r\nthe smallest clouds, at certain seasons, or above some barren plains\r\ndestitute of vegetation, seems to prove, that this influence can be felt\r\nat least as far as five or six thousand toises high. A phenomenon\r\nanalogous to that of the twelfth of November, was observed thirty years\r\nbefore, on the table-land of the Andes, in a country studded with\r\nvolcanoes. At the city of Quito, there was seen, in one part of the sky,\r\nabove the volcano of Gayambo, so great a number of falling stars, that\r\nthe mountain was thought to be in flames. This singular sight lasted\r\nmore than an hour. The people assembled in the plain of Exico, where a\r\nmagnificent view presents itself of the highest summit of the\r\nCordilleras. A procession was already on the point of setting out from\r\nthe convent of St. Francis, when it was perceived that the blaze of the\r\nhorizon was caused by fiery meteors, which ran along the skies in all\r\ndirections, at the altitude of twelve or thirteen degrees.”\r\n\r\nThe bolides, or fire-balls, and falling stars, so striking an example of\r\nwhich is given above, are of all sizes, from a small shooting-star of\r\nthe fifth magnitude, to a cone or cylinder of two or three miles in\r\ndiameter. They differ in consistency as much as in dimensions, and in\r\ncolor as much as in either. Occasionally, they are a subtile, luminous\r\nand pellucid vapor; and sometimes a compact ball, or globe, as though\r\nthe materials of which they are formed, were more condensed and\r\nconcentrated. Not unfrequently they have been found to consist of both,\r\nand consequently to assume a comet-like appearance, with a nucleus or\r\ncompact substance in the center, or toward the center, and a long, thin,\r\npellucid or luminous main, or tail, sweeping on each side. They are\r\nsometimes of a pale white light; at others, of a deep igneous crimson;\r\nand, occasionally iridescent and vibratory. The rarer meteors appear\r\nfrequently to vanish on a sudden, as though abruptly dissolved or\r\nextinguished in the atmospheric medium, their flight being accompanied\r\nby a hissing sound, and their disappearance by an explosion. The most\r\ncompact of them, or the nuclei of those which are rarer, have often\r\ndescended to the surface of the earth, and with a force sufficient to\r\nbury them many feet under the soil; generally exhibiting marks of\r\nimperfect fusion and considerable heat. The substance is, in these\r\ncases, for the greater part metallic; but the ore of which they consist\r\nis not anywhere to be found, in the same constituent proportions, in the\r\nbowels of the earth. Under this form the projected masses are\r\ndenominated aerolites, or meteoric stones.\r\n\r\nIt may not be uninteresting to preface a succinct account of the most\r\nsurprising of these meteors, by a notice of the hypotheses which have\r\nbeen imagined concerning them; however justly the learned Humboldt may\r\nhave concluded, in the words of the extracts given above, that we are\r\nstill “as ignorant on this subject as men were in the days of\r\nAnaxagoras.” Sir J. Pringle contended, with other philosophers, that\r\nthey are revolving bodies, or a kind of terrestrial planets. Doctor\r\nHalley conjectured them to consist of combustible vapors, accumulated\r\nand formed into concrete bodies on the outskirts, or extreme regions of\r\nthe atmosphere, and to be suddenly set on fire by some unknown cause; an\r\nopinion which, with little difference, has been since entertained by Sir\r\nW. Hamilton and Dr. King. Dr. Blagdon regarded them altogether as\r\nelectrical phenomena. M. Izarn believed them to consist of volcanic\r\nmaterials, propelled into the atmosphere in the course of explosions of\r\ngreat violence. M. Chladni supposed them to be formed of substances\r\nexisting exteriorly to the atmosphere of the earth and other planets,\r\nwhich have never incorporated with them, and are found loose in the vast\r\nocean of space, being there combined and inflamed by causes unknown to\r\nus. Lastly, another and rather wild hypothesis is, that the whole, or at\r\nleast the more compact division of these meteors, are made up of\r\nmaterials thrown from immense volcanoes in the moon. This hypothesis,\r\nwhich was started by M. Olbers, in 1795, has been since very plausibly\r\nsupported by the celebrated Laplace, but does not apply to the smaller\r\nand less substantial meteors, named shooting-stars. Hence these\r\nphilosophers derive the latter phenomena from some other cause, as\r\nelectricity, or terrestrial exhalations; and observe, in support of the\r\ndistinction they find it necessary to make, that shooting-stars must be\r\nof a different nature from fire-balls, since they sometimes appear to\r\nascend as well as to fall. This observation has been especially dwelt on\r\nby Messrs. Chladni and Benzenberg, both of them favorably noticed, as\r\naccurate observers, by Humboldt.\r\n\r\nBy far the most plausible and satisfactory theory, however, is one\r\nsomewhat like that of Dr. Halley, which may be illustrated thus. If a\r\nstick of wood, after being covered over night in the hot ashes, so as to\r\nbecome in part or wholly charred, be taken out in the morning, and waved\r\nback and forth in the air, every one has noticed that it will send forth\r\nsparks by hundreds and thousands. Now the more modern theory as to these\r\naerolites, or falling-stars, is, that they are thrown off from small,\r\nopaque, planetary bodies, revolving in space, which when they come\r\nwithin the atmosphere of the earth, are heated from their rapid motion\r\nthrough it, and throw off small heated portions, like the sparks from\r\nthe waving brand. And this theory is confirmed by the fact, that, of\r\nlate years, these meteoric showers have been annual, and always at about\r\nthe same period of the year, as if the earth was then passing in that\r\npart of her orbit where she meets with the planetary bodies spoken of,\r\nand they come in contact with her atmosphere. In the volumes of the\r\n“American Journal of Science,” may be found abundant facts on this\r\nsubject, and also the various theories started to account for the facts.\r\n\r\nOn the twenty-first of March, 1676, two hours after sunset, an\r\nextraordinary meteor was seen to pass over Italy. At Bononia, its\r\ngreatest altitude in the south-south-east, was thirty-eight degrees; and\r\nat Sienna, fifty-eight degrees toward the north-north-east. In its\r\ncourse, which was from east-north-east to west-south-west, it passed\r\nover the Adriatic sea, as if coming from Dalmatia. It crossed all Italy,\r\nbeing nearly vertical to Rimini and Savigniano, on the one side, and to\r\nLeghorn on the other: its perpendicular altitude was at least\r\nthirty-eight miles. At all the places near its course it was heard to\r\nmake a hissing noise as it passed, like that of artificial fireworks. In\r\npassing over Leghorn, it gave a very loud report, like that of a cannon;\r\nimmediately after which another sort of sound was heard, like the\r\nrattling of a deeply loaded wagon passing over the stones, which\r\ncontinued for several seconds. The professor of mathematics at Bononia,\r\ncalculated the apparent velocity of this surprising meteor at not less\r\nthan one hundred and sixty miles in a minute of time, which is above ten\r\ntimes as swift as the diurnal rotation of the earth under the\r\nequinoctial, and not many times less than that with which the annual\r\nmotion of the earth about the sun is performed. It there appeared larger\r\nthan the moon in one diameter, and above half as large again in the\r\nother; which, with the given distance of the eye, made its real smaller\r\ndiameter above half a mile, and the larger one in proportion. It is,\r\ntherefore, not surprising, that so great a body, passing with such an\r\namazing velocity through the air, however rarefied it may be in its\r\nupper regions, should occasion so loud a hissing noise as to be heard at\r\nsuch a distance. It finally went off to sea toward Corsica.\r\n\r\nTwo luminous meteors of great magnitude were noted at Leipsic within the\r\nspace of six years. On the twenty-second of May, 1680, about three in\r\nthe morning, the first of these was seen, to the great terror of the\r\nspectators, descending in the north, and leaving behind it a long white\r\nstreak where it had passed. As the same phenomena was witnessed in the\r\nnorth-north-east at Haarburg, and also at Hamburg, Lubeck and Stralsund,\r\nall of which places are about a hundred and fifty English miles from\r\nLeipsic, it was concluded that this meteor was exceedingly high above\r\nthe earth. The second meteor was still more terrific. On the ninth of\r\nJuly, 1686, at half past one in the morning, a fire-ball with a tail was\r\nobserved in eight and a half degrees of Aquarius, and four degrees\r\nnorth, which continued nearly stationary for seven or eight minutes,\r\nwith a diameter nearly equal to half the moon’s diameter. At first, its\r\nlight was so great that the spectators could see to read by it; after\r\nwhich it gradually disappeared. This phenomenon was observed at the same\r\ntime in several other places, more especially at Schlaitza, a town\r\ndistant from Dantzic forty English miles toward the south, its altitude\r\nbeing about six degrees above the southern horizon. At Leipsic it was\r\nestimated to be distant not more than sixty English miles, and to be\r\nabout twenty-four miles perpendicular above the horizon, so that it was\r\nat least thirty miles high in the air.\r\n\r\nA very extraordinary meteor, which the common people called a flaming\r\nsword, was first seen at Leeds, in Yorkshire, on the eighteenth of May,\r\n1710, at a quarter after ten at night. Its direction was from south to\r\nnorth: it was broad at one end, and small at the other; and was\r\ndescribed by the spectators as resembling a trumpet, moving, with the\r\nbroad end foremost. The light was so sudden and intense, that they were\r\nstartled at seeing their own shadows, when neither sun nor moon shone\r\nupon them. This meteor was, in its course, seen not only in Yorkshire\r\nand Lancashire, but also in the counties of Nottingham and Derby,\r\nnotwithstanding which, each of those who observed it, although so many\r\nmiles distant from each other, fancied it fell within a few yards of\r\nhim. In disappearing, it presented bright sparklings at the small end.\r\n\r\nA blazing meteor was, on the nineteenth of March, 1719, seen in every\r\npart of England. In the metropolis, about a quarter after eight at\r\nnight, a sudden powerful light was perceived in the west, far exceeding\r\nthat of the moon, which then shone very bright. The long stream it gave\r\nout appeared to be branched about the middle; and the meteor, in its\r\ncourse, turned pear-fashioned, or tapering upward. At the lower end it\r\ncame at length to be larger and spherical, although not so large as the\r\nfull moon. Its color was whitish, with an eye of blue of a most vivid,\r\ndazzling luster, which seemed in brightness very nearly to resemble, if\r\nnot to surpass, that of the body of the sun in a clear day. This\r\nbrightness obliged the spectator to turn his eyes several times from it,\r\nas well when it was a stream, as when it was pear-fashioned and a globe.\r\nIt seemed to move, in about half a minute or less, about the length of\r\ntwenty degrees, and to disappear about as much above the horizon. Where\r\nit had passed, it left behind a track of a cloudy or faint\r\nreddish-yellow color, such as red-hot iron or glowing coals have: this\r\ncontinued more than a minute, seemed to sparkle, and kept its place\r\nwithout falling. This track was interrupted, or had a chasm toward its\r\nupper end, at about two-thirds of its length. No explosion was heard;\r\nbut the place where the globe of light had been, continued for some time\r\nafter it was extinct, of the same reddish-yellow color with the stream,\r\nand at first sparks seemed to issue from it, such as proceed from\r\nred-hot iron beaten out on an anvil.\r\n\r\nIt was agreed by all the spectators in the capital, that the splendor of\r\nthis meteor was little inferior to that of the sun. Within doors the\r\ncandles did not give out any light; and in the streets, not only all the\r\nstars disappeared, but the moon, then nine days old, and high near the\r\nmeridian, the sky being very clear, was so far effaced as scarcely to be\r\nseen: it did not even cast a shade, where the beams of the meteor were\r\nintercepted by the houses; so that, for a few seconds of time, there was\r\nin every respect, a resemblance of perfect day.\r\n\r\nThe perpendicular hight of this surprising meteor was estimated at\r\nsixty-four geometrical miles; and it was computed to have run about\r\nthree hundred of these miles in a minute. It was seen, not only in every\r\npart of Great Britain and Ireland, but likewise in Holland, in the\r\nwestern parts of Germany, in France and in Spain, nearly at the same\r\ninstant of time. The accounts from Devonshire, Cornwall, and the\r\nneighboring counties, were unanimous in describing the wonderful noise\r\nwhich followed its explosion. It resembled the report of a large cannon,\r\nor rather of a broadside at some distance, which was soon followed by a\r\nrattling noise, as if many small arms had been promiscuously discharged.\r\nThis tremendous sound was attended by an uncommon tremor of the air; and\r\neverywhere in those counties, not only the windows and doors of the\r\nhouses were sensibly shaken, but, according to several of the reports,\r\neven the houses themselves, beyond the usual effect of cannon, however\r\nnear.\r\n\r\nOn the eleventh of December, 1741, at seven minutes past one in the\r\nafternoon, a globe of fire, somewhat larger than the horizontal full\r\nmoon, and as bright as the moon appears at any time when the sun is\r\nabove the horizon, was seen at Peckham, in Surrey, in a south-south-east\r\ndirection, moving toward the east with a continued equable motion, and\r\nleaving behind it a narrow streak of light, whiter than the globe\r\nitself, throughout its whole course. Toward the end it appeared less\r\nthan at the beginning of its motion; and within three or four seconds\r\nsuddenly vanished. Its apparent velocity was nearly equal to half the\r\nmedium velocity of the ordinary meteors called falling or shooting\r\nstars; and its elevation, throughout the whole of its course, about\r\ntwenty degrees above the horizon.\r\n\r\nOn the eighteenth of August, 1783, an uncommon meteor was seen in\r\nseveral parts of Great Britain, as well as on the continent. Its general\r\nappearance was that of a luminous ball, which, rising in the\r\nnorth-north-east, nearly of a globular form, became elliptical, and\r\ngradually assumed a tail as it ascended. In a certain part of its course\r\nit underwent a remarkable change, which might be compared to bursting,\r\nand which, it ought to be observed, has been since frequently noticed in\r\nthe passage of the aerolites, or meteoric stones, particular mention of\r\nwhich will be made hereafter. After this it no longer proceeded as an\r\nentire mass, but was apparently divided into a great number, or cluster\r\nof balls, some larger than others, and all carrying a tail, or leaving a\r\ntrain behind. Under this form, it continued its course with a nearly\r\nequable motion, dropping or casting off sparks, and yielding a\r\nprodigious light, which illumined all objects to a surprising degree;\r\nuntil, having passed the east, and verging considerably to the\r\nsouthward, it gradually distended, and was at length lost to the sight.\r\nThe time of its appearance was sixteen minutes past nine in the evening,\r\nmean time of the meridian of London, and it continued visible about half\r\na minute.\r\n\r\nThis beautiful meteor having been seen in Shetland, and in the northern\r\nparts of Scotland, ascending from the north, and rising like the planet\r\nMars, little doubt was entertained of its course having commenced beyond\r\nthe furthest extremity of Great Britain, somewhere over the northern\r\nocean. Having passed over Essex and the straits of Dover, it probably\r\nentered the continent not far from Dunkirk, where, as well as at Calais\r\nand Ostend, it was thought to be vertical. Still holding on its course\r\nto the southward, it was seen at Brussels, at Paris, and at Nuits in\r\nBurgundy; insomuch that there was sufficient proof of its having\r\ntraversed thirteen or fourteen degrees of latitude, describing a track\r\nof at least one thousand miles over the surface of the earth; a length\r\nof course far exceeding the extent of what had been then ascertained of\r\nany similar phenomenon.\r\n\r\nDuring the passage of this meteor over Brussels, the moon appeared quite\r\nred, but soon recovered its natural light. The results of several\r\nobservations give it an elevation of more than fifty miles above the\r\nsurface of the earth, in a region where the air is at least thirty\r\nthousand times rarer than here below. Notwithstanding this great\r\nelevation, the fact of a report having been heard some time after it\r\ndisappeared, rests on the testimony of too many witnesses to be\r\ncontroverted. It was compared to the falling of some heavy body in a\r\nroom above stairs, or to the discharge of one or more large cannon at a\r\ndistance: this report was loudest in Lincolnshire and the adjacent\r\ncounties, and also in the eastern parts of Kent.\r\n\r\nSupposing the transverse diameter of this meteor to have subtended an\r\nangle of thirty minutes when it passed over the zenith, and that it was\r\nfifty miles high, it must have been almost half a mile across. The tail\r\nsometimes appeared ten or twelve times longer than the body; but most of\r\nthis was train, and the real elongation behind seems seldom to have\r\nexceeded twice or thrice its transverse diameter; it consequently was\r\nbetween one and two miles in length. Now if the cubical contents be\r\nconsidered, for it appeared equally round and full in all directions,\r\nsuch an enormous mass must afford just matter of astonishment, when the\r\nextreme velocity with which it moved is considered. This velocity,\r\nagreeably to the observations of Sir William Herschel and several other\r\nastronomers, could not have been less than twenty miles in a second,\r\nexceeding that of sound above ninety times, and approaching toward that\r\nof the earth in her annual orbit. At such a rate it must have passed\r\nover the whole island of Great Britain in less than half a minute, and\r\nwould, in the space of less than seven minutes, have traversed the whole\r\ndiameter of the earth!\r\n\r\nOn the fourth of October, of the above year, 1783, two meteors were seen\r\nin England. The first, at three in the morning, on account of the early\r\nhour, was witnessed by but few spectators, who represented it as rising\r\nfrom the north to a small altitude, and then becoming stationary with a\r\nvibratory motion, and an illumination like daylight: it vanished in a\r\nfew moments, leaving a train behind. This sort of tremulous appearance\r\nhas been noticed in other meteors, as well as their continuing\r\nstationary for some time, either before they begin to shoot, or after\r\ntheir course is ended. The second of these meteors appeared at\r\nforty-three minutes past six in the evening, and was much smaller, and\r\nalso of much shorter duration, than the one seen in August. It was first\r\nobserved to the north, like a stream of fire, similar to that of the\r\ncommon shooting-stars, but large; and having proceeded some distance\r\nunder this form, suddenly burst out into that intensely bright bluish\r\nlight, peculiar to such meteors, which may be most aptly compared to the\r\nblue lights of India, or to some of the largest electrical sparks. The\r\nillumination was very great; and on that part of its course where it had\r\nbeen so bright, a dusky red streak or train was left, which remained\r\nvisible about a minute, and was thought by some gradually to change its\r\nform. Except this train, the meteor had not any tail, but was nearly of\r\na round body, or, perhaps, somewhat elliptical. After moving not less\r\nthan ten degrees in this bright state, it became suddenly extinct,\r\nwithout any appearance of bursting or explosion.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               AEROLITES.\r\n\r\nThese phenomena, otherwise entitled meteoric stones, have been\r\nascertained, by recent observations, to be connected with the bolides,\r\nor fire-balls, described above. Scoriaceous masses have frequently been\r\neither actually seen to fall at the time of the disappearance of the\r\nlatter, or have been found soon after on the surface of the earth. Most\r\nof the stones which have fallen from the atmosphere, have been preceded\r\nby the appearance of luminous bodies, or meteors. These meteors burst\r\nwith an explosion, and then the shower of stones falls to the earth.\r\nSometimes the stones continue luminous till they sink into the earth;\r\nbut most commonly their luminousness disappears at the time of their\r\nexplosion. These meteors move in a direction nearly horizontal, and seem\r\nto approach the earth before they explode.\r\n\r\nThe stony bodies, when found immediately after their descent, are always\r\nhot. They commonly bury themselves some depth under ground. Their size\r\ndiffers, from fragments of a very inconsiderable weight, to masses of\r\nseveral tuns. They usually approach the spherical form, and are always\r\ncovered with a black crust; in many cases they smell strongly of\r\nsulphur. The black crust consists chiefly of oxyd of iron; and from\r\nseveral accurate analyses of these stones, the following important\r\ninferences have been drawn: that not any other bodies have as yet been\r\ndiscovered on our globe which contain the same ingredients; and that\r\nthey have made us acquainted with a species of pyrites not formerly\r\nknown, nor anywhere else to be found.\r\n\r\nThe ancients were not unacquainted with these meteoric stones, a shower\r\nof which is reported by Livy to have fallen at Rome under the consulate\r\nof Tullus Hostilius, and another under that of C. Martius and M.\r\nTorquatus. Pliny relates that a shower of iron (for thus he designates\r\nthese stones) fell in Lucania, a year before the defeat of Crassus, and\r\nlikewise speaks of a very large stone which fell near the river Negos,\r\nin Thrace. In the chronicle of Count Marcellin, there is an account of\r\nthree immensely large stones having fallen in Thrace, in the year 452\r\nbefore the advent of Christ.\r\n\r\nTo proceed to more modern and well authenticated instances of the fall\r\nof aerolites. On the seventh of November, 1492, a little before noon, a\r\ndreadful thunder-clap was heard at Ensisheim, in Alsace, instantly after\r\nwhich a child saw a huge stone fall on a field newly sown with wheat. On\r\nsearching, it was found to have penetrated the earth about three feet,\r\nand weighed two hundred and sixty pounds, making its size equal to a\r\ncube of thirteen inches the side. All the contemporary writers agree in\r\nthe reality of this phenomenon, observing that, if such a stone had\r\nbefore existed in a plowed land, it must have been known to the\r\nproprietor. The celebrated astronomer Gassendi relates an instance of an\r\naerolite descent of which he was himself an eye-witness. On the\r\ntwenty-seventh of November, 1627, the sky being clear, he saw a burning\r\nstone fall on Mont Vasir, in the south-east extremity of France, near\r\nNice. While in the air, it seemed to be about four feet in diameter, was\r\ninclosed in a luminous circle of colors like a rainbow, and in its fall\r\nproduced a sound like the discharge of cannon. It weighed fifty-nine\r\npounds, was very hard, of a dull metallic color, and had a specific\r\ngravity considerably greater than that of marble. In the year 1672, two\r\nstones fell near Verona, in Italy, the one weighing three hundred, the\r\nother two hundred pounds. This phenomenon was witnessed in the evening,\r\nby three or four hundred persons. The stones fell, with a violent\r\nexplosion, in a sloping direction, and in calm weather. They appeared to\r\nburn, and plowed up the ground. Paul Lucas, the traveler, relates that\r\nwhen he was at Larissa, a town of Greece, near the gulf of Salonica, a\r\nstone weighing seventy-two pounds, fell in the vicinity. It was observed\r\nto come from the northward, with a loud hissing noise, and seemed to be\r\nenveloped in a small cloud, which exploded when the stone fell. It\r\nlooked like iron dross, and smelt of sulphur. In September, 1753,\r\nseveral stones fell in the province of Bresse, to the west of Geneva:\r\none in particular fell at Pont de Vesle, and another at Liponas, places\r\nnine miles distant from each other. The sky was clear, and the weather\r\nwarm. A loud noise, and a hissing sound, were heard at those two places,\r\nand for several miles round, on the fall of these stones, which exactly\r\nresembled each other, were of a darkish, dull color, very ponderous, and\r\nmanifesting on their surface that they had suffered a violent degree of\r\nheat. The largest weighed about twenty pounds, and penetrated about six\r\ninches into the plowed ground; a circumstance which renders it highly\r\nimprobable that they could have existed there before the explosion. This\r\nphenomenon has been described by the astronomer Delalande, whose strict\r\ninquiries on the spot enabled him to testify the truth of the\r\ncircumstances he relates. In the year 1768, three stones were presented\r\nto the French Academy of Sciences, which had fallen in different parts\r\nof France; one at Luce, in the Maine; another at Aire, in Artois; and\r\nthe third in Cotentin. They were all externally of the same identical\r\nappearance; and on the former of them a particular report was drawn up\r\nby Messrs. Fougeraux, Cadet and Lavoisier. This report states, that on\r\nthe eighteenth of September, 1768, between four and five in the\r\nafternoon, there was seen, near the above village of Luce, a cloud in\r\nwhich a short explosion took place, followed by a hissing noise, but\r\nwithout any flame. The same sound was heard by several persons about ten\r\nmiles from Luce; and, on looking up, they perceived an opaque body\r\ndescribe a curve in the air, and fall on a piece of green turf near the\r\nhigh road. They immediately ran to the spot, where they found a kind of\r\nstone, half-buried in the earth, extremely hot, and weighing about seven\r\npounds and a half.\r\n\r\nIn the particular instance now to be cited, very distinct traces were\r\nleft to show the progress of aerolites through the air. During the\r\nexplosion of a meteor near Bordeaux, on the twentieth of August, 1789, a\r\nstone, in diameter about fifteen inches, fell through the roof of a\r\ncottage, and killed a herdsman and some cattle. Part of this stone is\r\nnow in the Greville museum, and part in the museum of Bordeaux. On the\r\ntwenty-fourth of July, 1790, between nine and ten at night, a shower of\r\nstones fell near Agen, in Guienne, near the south-west angle of France.\r\nFirst a luminous ball of fire was seen traversing the atmosphere with\r\ngreat rapidity, and leaving behind it a train of light which lasted\r\nabout fifty seconds; soon after this a loud explosion was heard, and\r\nsparks were seen to fly off in all directions. This was soon after\r\nfollowed by the fall of stones, over a considerable extent of ground,\r\nand at various distances from each other. These were all alike in\r\nappearance, but of many different sizes, the greater number weighing\r\nabout two ounces, but many a vast deal more. Some fell with a hissing\r\nnoise, and entered the ground; but the smaller ones remained on the\r\nsurface. The only damage done by this shower of stones was, that they\r\nbroke the tiles of several houses, in falling on which they had not the\r\nsound of hard and compact substances, but of matter in a soft,\r\nhalf-melted state. Such as fell on straws adhered to them, and could not\r\nbe readily separated; a manifest proof that they were in a state of\r\nfusion.\r\n\r\nOn the eighteenth of December, 1795, several persons near the house of\r\nCaptain Topham, in Yorkshire, heard a loud noise in the air, followed by\r\na hissing sound, and soon after felt a shock, as if a heavy body had\r\nfallen to the ground at a little distance from them. In reality, one of\r\nthem saw a huge stone fall to the earth, at the distance of eight or\r\nnine yards from the place where he stood. When he first observed it, it\r\nwas seven or eight yards above the ground; and in its fall it threw up\r\nthe mold on every side, burying itself twenty-one inches in the earth.\r\nThis stone on being dug up, was found to weigh fifty-six pounds. On the\r\nseventeenth of March, 1798, a body, burning with an intense light,\r\npassed over the vicinity of Ville Franche, on the Saone, near Lyons,\r\naccompanied by a hissing sound, and leaving behind a luminous track.\r\nThis phenomenon exploded with a great noise, about twelve hundred feet\r\nfrom the ground, and one of the splinters, still luminous, having been\r\nobserved to fall in a neighboring vineyard, was traced. It was about a\r\nfoot in diameter, and had penetrated twenty inches into the ground. On\r\nthe fourth of July, 1803, a ball of fire struck a public house at East\r\nNorton, in Oxfordshire. The chimney was thrown down, the roof partly\r\ntorn off, the windows shattered to atoms, and the dairy, &c., converted\r\ninto a heap of rubbish. It was of considerable magnitude, and, on coming\r\nin contact with the house, exploded with great noise, and a very\r\noppressive sulphureous smell. Several fragments of stones were found on\r\nthe spot, having a surface of a dark color, and varnished, as if in a\r\nstate of fusion, with numerous globules of a whitish metal, combining\r\nsulphur and nickel. The indentures on these surfaces render it probable\r\nthat the ball was soft when it descended; and it was obviously in a\r\nstate of fusion, as the grass was burned where the fragments fell. The\r\nmotion of the fire-ball, while in the air, was very rapid, and\r\napparently parallel to the horizon.\r\n\r\nThe latest remarkable fall of aerolites in Europe, of which there is a\r\ndistinct account, was in the vicinity of Laigle, in Normandy, early in\r\nthe afternoon of the twenty-sixth of April, 1812. A fiery globe of a\r\nvery brilliant splendor, which moved in the air with great rapidity, was\r\nfollowed in a few seconds by a violent explosion, which lasted five or\r\nsix minutes, and was heard to the extent of more than thirty leagues in\r\nevery direction. Three or four reports, like those of a cannon, were\r\nfollowed by a discharge resembling a fire of musketry, after which a\r\ndreadful rumbling was heard like the beating of a drum. The air was\r\ncalm, and the sky serene, with the exception of a few clouds, such as\r\nare frequently observed. The noise proceeded from a small cloud of a\r\nrectangular form, the largest side being in a direction from east to\r\nwest. It appeared motionless all the time the phenomenon lasted; but the\r\nvapor of which it was composed was projected momentarily from the\r\ndifferent sides by the effect of the successive explosions. This cloud\r\nwas about half a league to the north-north-east of the town of Laigle,\r\nand was at so great an elevation, that the inhabitants of two hamlets, a\r\nleague distant from each other, saw it at the same time over their\r\nheads. In the whole canton over which this cloud hovered, a hissing\r\nnoise, like that of a stone discharged from a sling, was heard; and a\r\nmultitude of meteoric stones were seen to fall at the same time. The\r\ndistrict in which they fell forms an elliptical extent of about two\r\nleagues and a half in length, and nearly one in breadth; the greatest\r\ndimension being in a direction from south-east to north-west, forming a\r\ndeclination of about twenty-two degrees. This direction, which the\r\nmeteor must have followed, is exactly that of the magnetic meridian;\r\nwhich is a remarkable fact. The number of these stones was reckoned to\r\nexceed three thousand; and the largest of them weighed nearly twenty\r\npounds. They were friable some days after their fall, and smelt strongly\r\nof sulphur. They subsequently acquired the degree of hardness common to\r\nthis kind of stones.\r\n\r\nWhile, in Europe, these phenomena thus strongly confirmed the long\r\nexploded idea of the vulgar, that many of the luminous meteors observed\r\nin the atmosphere, are masses of ignited matter, an account of one of\r\nprecisely the same description was received from the East Indies. On the\r\nnineteenth of December, 1798, at eight in the evening, a large\r\nfire-ball, or luminous meteor, was seen at Benares, and at several\r\nplaces in its vicinity. It was attended by a loud rumbling noise; and,\r\nabout the same time, the inhabitants of Krakhut, fourteen miles from\r\nBenares, saw the light, heard what resembled a loud thunder-clap, and,\r\nimmediately after, the noise of heavy bodies falling around them. Next\r\nmorning the mold in the fields was found to have been turned up in many\r\nspots; and unusual stones of various sizes, but of the same substances,\r\nwere picked from the moist soil, generally at a depth of six inches. One\r\nstone fell through the roof of a hut, and buried itself in the earthen\r\nfloor.\r\n\r\nFrom these multiplied evidences it is proved that, in various parts of\r\nthe world, luminous meteors have been seen moving through the air with\r\nsurprising rapidity, in a direction more or less oblique, accompanied\r\nwith a noise, commonly like the whizzing of cannon-balls, followed by\r\nexplosion, and the fall of hard, stony, or semi-metallic masses in a\r\nheated state. The constant whizzing sound; the fact of stones being\r\nfound, like each other, but unlike all others in the vicinity, at the\r\nspots toward which the luminous body, or its fragments, had been seen to\r\nmove; the scattering or plowing up of the soil at those spots, always in\r\nproportion to the size of the stones; the concussion of the neighboring\r\nground at the same time; and especially, the impinging of the stones on\r\nbodies somewhat above the earth, or lying loose on its surface; all\r\nthese are circumstances perfectly well authenticated in these reports,\r\nproving that such meteors are usually inflamed hard masses, descending\r\nrapidly through the air to the earth.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 AURORA BOREALIS AND AURORA AUSTRALIS.\r\n\r\nThese splendid meteors are generally considered as the result of a\r\ncombination of the two powers of magnetism and electricity. When the\r\n_light_, or _aurora_, appears chiefly in the north part of the heavens,\r\nit is called the _aurora borealis_, or northern lights; and when chiefly\r\nin the south part, the =aurora australis=, or southern lights. Where the\r\ncoruscation is more than ordinarily bright and streaming, which,\r\nhowever, seldom occurs in the north, it is denominated =lumen boreale=;\r\nand where these streams have assumed a decided curvature, like that of\r\nthe rainbow, they are distinguished by the name of luminous arches.\r\n\r\nThe aurora is chiefly visible in the winter season, and in cold weather.\r\nIt is usually of a reddish color, inclining to yellow, and sends out\r\nfrequent coruscations of pale light, which seem to rise from the horizon\r\nin a pyramidal, undulating form, shooting with great velocity up to the\r\nzenith. It never appears near the equator; but of late years has\r\nfrequently been seen toward the south pole. The =aurora borealis= has\r\nappeared at some periods more frequently than at others. This phenomenon\r\nwas so rare in England, or so little regarded, that its appearance was\r\nnot recorded in the English annals between a remarkable one observed on\r\nthe fourteenth of November, 1554, and a very brilliant one on the sixth\r\nof March, 1716, and the two succeeding nights, but which was much\r\nstrongest on the first night. Hence it may be inferred, that the state\r\nof either the air or earth, or perhaps of both, is not at all times\r\nfitted for its production.\r\n\r\nThe extent of these appearances is surprisingly great. The very\r\nbrilliant one referred to above was visible from the west of Ireland to\r\nthe confines of Russia, and the east of Poland, extending over, at the\r\nleast, thirty degrees of longitude, and, from about the fiftieth degree\r\nof latitude, over almost all the northern part of Europe. In every\r\nplace, it exhibited, at the same time, the same wonderful features. The\r\nelevation of these lights is equally surprising: an =aurora borealis=\r\nwhich appeared on the sixteenth of December, 1737, was ascertained, by\r\nmeans of thirty computations, to have an average hight from the earth of\r\none hundred and seventy-five leagues, equal to four hundred and\r\nsixty-four English miles.\r\n\r\nCaptain Cook, in his first voyage round the world, observed that these\r\ncoruscations are frequently visible in southern latitudes. On the\r\nsixteenth of September, 1770, he witnessed an appearance of this kind\r\nabout ten o’clock at night, consisting of a dull, reddish light, and\r\nextending about twenty degrees above the horizon. Its extent was very\r\ndifferent at different times, but it was never less than eight or ten\r\npoints of the compass. Rays of light, of a brighter color, passed\r\nthrough and without it; and these rays vanished and were renewed nearly\r\nin the same time as those in the =aurora borealis=, but had little or no\r\nvibration. Its body bore south-south-east from the ship, and continued,\r\nwithout any diminution of its brightness, till twelve o’clock, when the\r\nobservers retired. The ship was at this time within the tropic of\r\nCapricorn.\r\n\r\nOn the seventeenth of February, 1773, during his second voyage, Captain\r\nCook speaks of a beautiful phenomenon that was observed in the heavens.\r\n“It consisted of long columns of a clear white light, shooting up from\r\nthe horizon to the eastward, almost to the zenith, and spreading\r\ngradually over the whole southern parts of the sky. These columns even\r\nsometimes bent sideways at their upper extremity; and, although in most\r\nrespects similar to the northern lights, (the =aurora borealis= of our\r\nhemisphere,) yet differed from them in being always of a whitish color;\r\nwhereas ours assume various tints, especially those of a fiery and\r\npurple hue. The stars were sometimes hidden by, and sometimes faintly to\r\nbe seen through the substance of these southern lights, =aurora\r\naustralis=. The sky was generally clear when they appeared, and the air\r\nsharp and cold, the mercury in the thermometer standing at the\r\nfreezing-point; the ship being then in fifty-eight degrees south.” On\r\nsix different nights of the following month (March) the same phenomenon\r\nwas observed.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  LUMEN BOREALE, OR STREAMING LIGHTS.\r\n\r\nOn the eighth of October, 1726, uncommon streams of light were exhibited\r\nin every part of the heavens, about eight o’clock in the evening. They\r\nwere seen throughout England, as well as in the southern parts of\r\nEurope. They were mostly pointed, and of different lengths, assuming the\r\nappearance of flaming spires or pyramids; some again were truncated, and\r\nreached but half-way; while others had their points reaching up to the\r\nzenith, or near it, where they formed a sort of canopy, or thin cloud,\r\nsometimes red, sometimes brownish, sometimes blazing as if on fire, and\r\nsometimes emitting streams all around it. This canopy was manifestly\r\nformed by the matter carried up by the streaming on all parts of the\r\nhorizon. It sometimes seemed to ascend with a force, as if impelled by\r\nthe impetus of some explosive agent below; and this forcible ascent of\r\nthe streaming matter gave a motion to the canopy, and sometimes a\r\ngyration, like that of a whirlwind. This was manifestly caused by the\r\nstreams striking the outer part of the canopy; but if they struck the\r\ncanopy in the center, all was then confusion. The vapors between the\r\nspires, or pyramids, were of a blood-red color, which gave those parts\r\nof the atmosphere the appearance of blazing lances and bloody-colored\r\npillars. There was also a strange commotion among the streams, as if\r\nsome large cloud or other body was moving behind and disturbing them. In\r\nthe northern and southern parts the streams were perpendicular to the\r\nhorizon; but in the intermediate points they seemed to decline more or\r\nless in one way or the other, or rather to incline toward the meridian.\r\nSeveral persons declared, that in the time of the streaming, they heard\r\na hissing, and in some places a crackling noise, like that which is\r\nreported to be often heard in earthquakes.\r\n\r\nAt Naples, on the sixteenth of December, 1737, early in the evening, a\r\nlight was observed in the north, as if the air was on fire, and\r\nflashing. Its intenseness gradually increasing, about seven o’clock it\r\nspread to the westward. Its greatest hight was about sixty-five degrees.\r\nIts extremities were unequally jagged and scattered, and followed the\r\ncourse of the westerly wind; so that for a few hours it spread\r\nconsiderably wider, yet without ever extending to the zenith. About\r\neight o’clock, a very regular arch, of a parabolic figure, was seen to\r\nrise gently to two degrees of rectangular elevation, and to twenty\r\ndegrees of horizontal amplitude. At ten the intenseness of the color\r\ndisappeared; and by midnight not any traces of this phenomenon were\r\nleft. It was seen throughout Italy, as the subsequent accounts will\r\nshow. At Padua, on the appearance of this extraordinary meteor, the air\r\nwas calm, and the barometer remarkably high. At five in the afternoon a\r\nblackish zone, with its upper limb of a sky-color, appeared near the\r\nhorizon; and above this zone was another, very luminous, resembling the\r\ndawn pretty far advanced. The highest zone was of a red, fiery color. A\r\nlittle after six o’clock, the upper parts of these zones emitted an\r\nabundance of red streamings, or rays; their vivid color being\r\noccasionally intermixed with whitish and dark spots. In a few seconds\r\nafter, there issued from the west, a red and very bright column, which\r\nascended to the third part of the heavens, and a little after became\r\ncurved like a rainbow. At half past eight, almost instantaneously, the\r\nbright zone, from eight degrees west to fifty degrees east, became more\r\nvivid, and rose higher; and above this appeared another and larger one,\r\nof a red, fiery color, with several successive streamings tending\r\nupward, and exceeding sixty degrees of altitude; the western part having\r\nassumed the form of a thin cloud. At midnight these splendid lights\r\ndisappeared entirely. At Bononia, this surprising meteor spread to such\r\nan extent as to occupy about one hundred and forty degrees of the\r\nheavens. Its light was so vivid that houses could be distinguished, at\r\neight in the evening, at a very considerable distance; and these were so\r\nreddened, that many persons thought there was a fire in the\r\nneighborhood. At that time the aurora formed itself into a concave arch\r\ntoward the horizon; and in half an hour, at its eastern limit, a pyramid\r\nwas displayed, of a more intense color toward the north, from the center\r\nof which there shot up vertically a streak of light, between a white and\r\na yellow color. A very dark, narrow cloud crossed the whole phenomenon,\r\nand terminated in the pyramid. At the upper part, a very considerable\r\ntract of the heavens was enlightened by a very vivid red light, which\r\nwas interrupted by several streaks or columns of a bright yellowish\r\nlight. These streamings shot up vertically, and parallel to each other,\r\nthe narrow cloud seeming to serve them as a basis. Under the cloud there\r\nissued forth two tails of a whitish light, hanging downward on a basis\r\nof a weak red, and seeming to kindle and dart the light downward. A\r\nwhite streak, which passed across these two tails, and extended from one\r\nend of the phenomenon to the other, in a position almost parallel to the\r\nabove-mentioned cloud, gave a splendid effect to the whole. This\r\nsurprising and beautiful meteor disappeared a short time after nine\r\no’clock; but an abundance of falling stars were afterward seen in the\r\nsouth.\r\n\r\nSimilar observations were made at Rome; but in Great Britain, where this\r\nphenomenon was likewise seen, different appearances were displayed. At\r\nEdinburgh, at six in the evening, the sky appeared to be in flames. An\r\narch of red light reached from the west, over the zenith, to the east,\r\nits northern border being tinged with a color approaching to blue. This\r\naurora did not first form in the north, as usually happens, and after\r\nforming an arch there, rise toward the zenith; neither did the light\r\nshiver, and spread itself, by sudden jerks, over the hemisphere, as is\r\ncommon, but it gradually and gently stole along the face of the heavens,\r\ntill it had covered the whole hemisphere: this alarmed the vulgar, and\r\nwas indeed a strange sight. At Rosehill, in Sussex, it appeared as a\r\nstrong and very steady light, nearly of the color of red ocher. It did\r\nnot dart or flash, but kept a steady course against the wind, which blew\r\nfresh from the south-west. It began in the north-north-west, in the form\r\nof a pillar of light, at a quarter past six in the evening: in about ten\r\nminutes a fourth part of it divided from the rest, and never joined\r\nagain. In ten minutes more it described an arch, but did not join at the\r\ntop; and at seven o’clock it formed a bow, disappearing soon after. It\r\nwas lightest and reddest at the horizon, and gave as much light as a\r\nfull moon.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            LUMINOUS ARCHES.\r\n\r\nIn the month of March, 1774, a very beautiful luminous arch was seen at\r\nBuxton. It was white, inclining to yellow: and its breadth in the crown\r\nwas apparently equal to that of the rainbow. As it approached the\r\nhorizon, each leg of the arch became gradually broader. It was\r\nstationary and free from any sensible coruscations. Its direction was\r\nfrom north-east to south-west; and its crown or most elevated part, not\r\nfar from the zenith. This phenomenon lasted about half an hour.\r\n\r\nThe grandest spectacle of this kind which appears to have been seen in\r\nGreat Britain, was observed at Leeds, in Yorkshire, on the twelfth of\r\nApril, 1783, between the hours of nine and ten at night. A broad arch of\r\na bright pale yellow, and having an apparent breadth of about fifteen\r\ndegrees, arose in the heavens, and passed considerably south of the\r\nzenith. Such was its varied density, that it appeared to consist of\r\nsmall columns of light, having a sensible motion. After about ten\r\nminutes, innumerable bright coruscations shot out at right angles from\r\nits northern edge, elongating themselves more and more till they had\r\nnearly reached the northern horizon. As they descended, their\r\nextremities were tipped with an elegant crimson, such as is produced by\r\nthe electric spark in an exhausted tube. After some time this beautiful\r\nnorthern light ceased to shoot, and, forming a line of bright yellow\r\nclouds, which extended horizontally about the fourth of a circle, its\r\ngreatest portion, which darted from this arch toward the north, as well\r\nas the cloudlike and more stationary aurora, became so dense as to hide\r\nthe stars from view. The moon was eleven days old, and shone brightly\r\nduring this scene, but did not eclipse the splendor of these\r\ncoruscations. The wind was in the north, a little inclined to the east.\r\nA similar phenomenon was observed at Leeds on the twenty-sixth of the\r\nsame month. From a mass or broad column of light in the west, issued\r\nthree luminous arches, each of which made a different angle with the\r\nhorizon. They had not been viewed many minutes when they were rendered\r\ninvisible by a general blaze of =aurora borealis=, which possessed the\r\nspace just before occupied by these arches.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      IGNES FATUI, OR MOCK FIRES.\r\n\r\nThese meteors, denominated by the vulgar, Will-with-a-wisp, and\r\nJack-with-a-lantern, and at sea or on the coast, mariner’s lights, or\r\nSt. Helmo’s fires, are now considered as real exhalations from the\r\nearth, produced by gas, vapor, or some other attenuated substance,\r\nemanating from vegetable, animal or mineral materials, and combined with\r\nthe matter of light or heat, or both. Instead of being dense or solid,\r\nthey are uniformly rare and subtile; and, instead of originating in the\r\nloftiest regions of the atmosphere, or beyond its range, are generated\r\nfor the greater part in low, marshy plains or valleys. To the fearful\r\nand superstitious, they are a source of as much terror as the nobler and\r\nsublimer meteors which have just been contemplated; and it is probable\r\nthat they have occasionally been the source of real and extensive\r\ndamage, when in a state of actual combustion, and that they have still\r\nmore frequently seduced a timid and benighted traveler into dangerous\r\nbogs and quagmires.\r\n\r\nIn Italy, in the Bolognese territory, they are so frequent, in the\r\nmorassy grounds, that they are to be seen every night, some of them\r\naffording as much light as a kindled torch, and others not being larger\r\nthan the flame of a candle, but all of them so luminous as to shed a\r\nluster on the surrounding objects. They are constantly in motion, but\r\nthis motion is various and uncertain. They sometimes rise and at other\r\ntimes sink, sometimes suddenly disappearing, and appearing again in an\r\ninstant in some other place. They usually hover about six feet from the\r\nground, differing both in figure and size, and spreading out and\r\ncontracting themselves alternately. Sometimes they break to appearance\r\ninto two parts, soon after uniting again in one body, and at intervals\r\nfloat like waves, letting fall portions of ignited matter, like sparks\r\nfrom a fire. They are more frequently observed in winter than in summer,\r\nand cast the strongest light in rainy and moist weather. They are most\r\nfriendly to the banks of brooks and rivers, and to morasses; but they\r\nare likewise seen on elevated grounds, where they are, however, of a\r\ncomparatively diminutive size.\r\n\r\nIn the month of March, 1728, a traveler being in a mountainous road,\r\nabout ten miles south of Bononia, perceived, as he approached the river\r\nRiovedere, between eight and nine in the evening, a light shining very\r\nbrightly on some stones which lay on the banks. It was elevated about\r\ntwo feet above them; its figure describing a parallelopiped, more than a\r\nfoot in length, and about six inches high, its longest side lying\r\nparallel to the horizon. Its light was so strong that he could\r\ndistinguish by it very plainly a part of a neighboring hedge, and the\r\nwater in the river. On a near approach, it changed from a bright red to\r\na yellowish color, and on drawing still nearer, became pale; but when\r\nthe observer reached the spot it vanished. On his stepping back, he not\r\nonly saw it again, but found that the further he receded, the stronger\r\nand more luminous it became. This light was afterward seen several\r\ntimes, both in spring and autumn, precisely at the same spot, and\r\npreserving the same shape.\r\n\r\nOn the twelfth of December, 1776, several very remarkable =ignes fatui=\r\nwere observed on the road to Bromsgrove, five miles from Birmingham, in\r\nEngland, a little before daylight. A great many of these lights were\r\nplaying in an adjacent field, in different directions; from some of\r\nwhich there suddenly sprang up bright branches of light, somewhat\r\nresembling the explosion of a rocket, filled with many brilliant stars,\r\nif, in the case of the latter, the discharge be supposed to be upward,\r\nor vertical, instead of taking the usual direction. The hedge, and the\r\ntrees on each side, were strongly illuminated. This appearance continued\r\na few seconds only, when the =ignes fatui= played as before. The\r\nspectator was not sufficiently near to observe whether the apparent\r\nexplosions were attended with any report.\r\n\r\nIn the month of December, 1693, between the twenty-fourth and thirtieth,\r\na fiery exhalation, without doubt generated in the same way with the\r\nmeteors described above, set fire to sixteen ricks of hay, and two barns\r\nfilled with corn and hay, at the village of Hartech, in Pembrokeshire.\r\nIt had frequently been seen before, proceeding from the sea, and in\r\nthese instances lasted for a fortnight or three weeks. It not only fired\r\nthe hay, but poisoned the grass, for the extent of a mile, so as to\r\ninduce a distemper among the cattle. It was a weak blue flame, easily\r\nextinguished, and did not in the least burn any of the men who\r\ninterposed their endeavors to save the hay, although they ventured, not\r\nonly close to it, but sometimes into it. All the damage sustained\r\nhappened constantly in the night.\r\n\r\nBelonging to this class of meteors is the =draco volans=, a fiery\r\nexhalation, frequent in marshy and cold countries. It is most common in\r\nsummer; and, although principally seen playing near the banks of rivers,\r\nor in boggy places, still it sometimes mounts up to a considerable hight\r\nin the air, to the no small terror of the amazed beholders. Its\r\nappearance is that of an oblong (sometimes roundish) fiery body, with a\r\nlong tail. It is entirely harmless, frequently sticking to the hands and\r\nclothes of the spectators, without doing them the least injury.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        SPECTER OF THE BROCKEN.\r\n\r\nThis is one of those curious and interesting atmospheric phenomena, or\r\ndeceptions, which proceed from one common cause, an irregularity in the\r\ntenuity of the atmospheric fluid. This fluid is commonly of an\r\nhomogeneous or equable tenuity, and consequently suffers the rays of the\r\nsun to penetrate it without any obstruction or change; but is at times\r\nirregular, and composed of parts of bodies of a denser medium than its\r\ngeneral texture and constitution. Under these circumstances, the fluent\r\nray, if it do not enter the denser medium in a direct or perpendicular\r\nline, will be either reflected, or refracted, or both; and the object\r\nsurveyed through it, will assume a new, and, not unfrequently, a\r\ngrotesque or highly magnified appearance.\r\n\r\nThe specter of the Brocken is an aerial figure which is sometimes seen\r\namong the Hartz mountains in Hanover. The phenomenon has been witnessed\r\nby various travelers, and among them by M. Haue, from whose relation the\r\nfollowing particulars are extracted. “Having ascended the Brocken\r\n[mountain] for the thirtieth time, I was at length so fortunate as to\r\nhave the pleasure of seeing this phenomenon. The sun rose about four\r\no’clock, and the atmosphere being quite serene toward the east, its rays\r\ncould pass without any obstruction over the Heinrichshohe mountain. In\r\nthe south-west, however, toward the mountain Achtermannshohe, a brisk\r\nwest wind carried before it thin transparent vapors. About a quarter\r\npast four, I looked round, to see whether the atmosphere would permit me\r\nto have a free prospect to the south-west, when I observed, at a very\r\ngreat distance toward the Achtermannshohe, a human figure of monstrous\r\nsize! A violent gust of wind having almost carried away my hat, I\r\nclapped my hand to it; and in moving my hand toward my head, the\r\ncolossal figure did the same.\r\n\r\n“The pleasure which I felt at this discovery can hardly be described;\r\nfor I had already walked many a weary step in the hope of seeing this\r\nshadowy image, without being able to gratify my curiosity. I immediately\r\nmade another movement, by bending my body, and the colossal figure\r\nbefore me repeated it. I was desirous of doing the same once more, but\r\nmy colossus had vanished. I remained in the same position, waiting to\r\nsee whether it would return; and in a few minutes it again made its\r\nappearance on the Achtermannshohe. I then called the landlord of the\r\nneighboring inn, and having both taken the position which I had taken\r\nalone, we looked toward the Achtermannshohe, but did not perceive\r\nanything. We had not, however, stood long, when two such colossal\r\nfigures were formed over the above eminence, [as represented in the\r\ncut,] which repeated their compliments by bending their bodies as we\r\ndid, after which they vanished. We retained our position, kept our eyes\r\nfixed on the spot, and in a little time the two figures again stood\r\nbefore us, and were joined by a third, [that of a traveler who then came\r\nup and joined the party.] Every movement made by us, these figures\r\nimitated; but with this difference, that the phenomenon was sometimes\r\nweak and faint, sometimes strong and well defined.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SPECTER OF THE BROCKEN.]\r\n\r\nIn Clarke’s “Survey of the Lakes,” a phenomenon similar to that of the\r\nspecter of the Brocken, is recorded to have been observed in the years\r\n1743 and 1744, on Souter-Fell, a mountain in Cumberland. It excited much\r\nconversation and alarm at the time, and exposed to great ridicule those\r\nwho asserted they had witnessed it. It is, however, too well attested\r\nnot to deserve a short notice here, and may be referred to the same\r\ncauses by which the above aerial images on the Brocken mountain were\r\nproduced. The relation is as follows. Souter-Fell is a mountain about\r\nhalf a mile in hight, inclosed on the north and west sides by\r\nprecipitous rocks, but somewhat more open on the east, and easier of\r\naccess. At Wilton Hall, within half a mile of this mountain, on a\r\nsummer’s evening, in the year 1743, a farmer and his servant, sitting at\r\nthe door, saw the figure of a man with a dog, pursuing some horses along\r\nSouter-Fell side, a place so steep that a horse could scarcely travel on\r\nit. They appeared to run at a very great pace, till they got out of\r\nsight at the lower end of the fell. On the following morning the farmer\r\nand his servant ascended the steep side of the mountain, in full\r\nexpectation that they should find the man lying dead, being persuaded\r\nthat the swiftness with which he ran must have killed him, and imagining\r\nalso that they should pick up some of the shoes which they thought the\r\nhorses must have lost, in galloping at so furious a rate. They were,\r\nhowever, disappointed in these expectations, as not the least vestige of\r\neither man or horses could be discovered, not so much, even, as the mark\r\nof a horse’s hoof on the turf.\r\n\r\nOn the twenty-third of June, of the following year, 1744, about half\r\npast seven in the evening, the same servant, then residing at\r\nBlakehills, at an equal distance from the mountain, being in a field in\r\nfront of the farm-house, saw a troop of horsemen riding on Souter-Fell\r\nside in pretty close ranks, and at a brisk pace. Having observed them\r\nfor some time, he called out his young master, who before the spot was\r\npointed out to him, discovered the aerial troopers; and this phenomenon\r\nwas shortly after witnessed by the whole of the family. The visionary\r\nhorsemen appeared to come from the lowest part of Souter-Fell, and were\r\nvisible at a place called Knott: they then moved in regular troops along\r\nthe side of the fell, till they came opposite to Blakehills, when they\r\nwent over the mountain. They thus described a kind of curvilinear path,\r\nand their first as well as their last appearance, was bounded by the\r\nfoot of the mountain. Their pace was that of a regular swift walk, and\r\nthey were seen for upward of two hours, when darkness intervened.\r\nSeveral troops were seen in succession, and frequently the last, or last\r\nbut one in the troop, would quit his position, gallop to the front, and\r\nthen observe the same pace with the others. The same change was visible\r\nto all the spectators; and the sight of this phenomenon was not confined\r\nto Blakehills, but was witnessed by the inhabitants of the cottages\r\nwithin a mile. It was attested before a magistrate by the two\r\nabove-cited individuals in the month of July, 1745. Twenty-six persons\r\nare said in the attestation to have witnessed the march of these aerial\r\ntravelers.\r\n\r\nIt should be remarked that these appearances were observed on the eve of\r\nthe rebellion, when troops of horsemen might be privately exercising;\r\nand as the imitative powers of the specter of the Brocken demonstrate\r\nthat the actions of human beings are sometimes pictured in the clouds,\r\nit seems highly probable, on a consideration of all the circumstances of\r\nthis latter phenomenon on Souter-Fell, that certain thin vapors must\r\nhave hovered round the summit of the mountain when the appearances were\r\nobserved. It is also probable that these vapors may have been impressed\r\nwith the shadowy forms which seem to “imitate humanity,” by a particular\r\noperation of the sun’s rays, united with some singular but unknown\r\nrefractive combinations then taking place in the atmosphere.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              THE MIRAGE.\r\n\r\nThis very curious phenomenon, which was remarked by M. Monge, one of the\r\nFrench savans belonging to the institute of Cairo, in the hot and sandy\r\ndesert between Alexandria and that city, is described by him as\r\nresulting from an inverted image of the cerulean sky intermixed with the\r\nground scenery, the neighboring villages appearing to be surrounded with\r\na most beautiful sheet of water, and to exist, like islands, in its\r\nliquid expanse, tantalizing the eye by an unfaithful representation of\r\nwhat the thirsty traveler earnestly desires.\r\n\r\nDoctor Clarke, in his interesting travels, introduces the following\r\nanimated description of this phenomenon. “Here [at the village of Utko]\r\nwe procured asses for our party, and, setting out for Rosetta, began to\r\nrecross the desert, appearing like an ocean of sand, but flatter and\r\nfirmer as to its surface, than before. The Arabs, uttering their harsh,\r\nguttural language, ran chattering by the side of our asses; until some\r\nof them calling out _‘Raschid!’_ we perceived its domes and turrets,\r\napparently upon the opposite side of an immense lake or sea, that\r\ncovered all the intervening space between us and the city. Not having in\r\nmy own mind, at the time, any doubt as to the certainty of its being\r\nwater, and seeing the tall minarets and buildings of Rosetta, with all\r\nits groves of dates and sycamores, as perfectly reflected by it as by a\r\nmirror, insomuch that even the minutest detail of the architecture and\r\nof the trees might have been thence delineated, I applied to the Arabs\r\nto be informed in what manner we were to pass the water. Our\r\ninterpreter, although a Greek, and therefore likely to have been\r\ninformed of such a phenomenon, was as fully convinced as any of us, that\r\nwe were drawing near to the water’s edge, and became indignant, when the\r\nArabs maintained, that within an hour we should reach Rosetta, by\r\ncrossing the sands in the direct line we then pursued, and that there\r\nwas no water. ‘What!’ said he, giving way to his impatience, ‘do you\r\nsuppose me an idiot, to be persuaded contrary to the evidence of my\r\nsenses?’ The Arabs, smiling, soon pacified him, and completely\r\nastonished the whole party, by desiring us to look back at the desert we\r\nhad already passed, where we beheld a precisely similar appearance. It\r\nwas, in fact, _the mirage_, a prodigy to which all of us were then\r\nstrangers, although it afterward became more familiar. Yet upon no\r\nfuture occasion did we ever behold this extraordinary illusion so\r\nmarvelously displayed. The view of it afforded us ideas of the horrible\r\ndespondency to which travelers must sometimes be exposed, who, in\r\ntraversing the interminable desert, destitute of water, and perishing\r\nwith thirst, have sometimes this deceitful prospect before their eyes.”\r\n\r\nThis appearance is often seen, when the sun shines, upon the extensive\r\nflat sand upon the shores of the Bristol channel, in Somersetshire, and\r\nprobably on the sea-shore in other parts of England.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             FATA MORGANA.\r\n\r\n       “As when a shepherd of the Hebride isles,\r\n         Placed far amid the melancholy main,\r\n       (Whether it be lone fancy him beguiles,\r\n         Or that aerial beings sometimes deign\r\n         To stand embodied to our senses plain,)\r\n       Sees on the naked hill, or valley low,\r\n         The whilst in ocean Phœbus dips his wain,\r\n       A vast assemblage moving to and fro;\r\n     Then all at once in air dissolves the wondrous show.”—THOMSON.\r\n\r\nThese optical appearances of figures in the sea and air, in the Faro of\r\nMessina, are the great delight of the populace, who, whenever the vision\r\nis displayed, run about the streets shouting for joy, and calling on\r\nevery one to partake of the glorious sight. To produce this pleasing\r\ndeception, many circumstances must concur which are not known to exist\r\nin any other situation. The spectator must stand with his back to the\r\neast, in some elevated place behind the city, that he may command a view\r\nof the whole bay, beyond which the mountains of Messina rise like a\r\nwall, and darken the background of the picture. The winds must be\r\nhushed, the surface of the water quite smooth, the tide at its hight,\r\nand the waters pressed up by currents to a great elevation in the middle\r\nof the channel. All these events coinciding, as soon as the sun\r\nsurmounts the eastern hills behind Reggio, (on the Calabrian coast\r\nopposite,) and rises high enough to form an angle of forty-five degrees\r\non the water before the city, every object, existing or moving at\r\nReggio, will be repeated a thousand-fold in this marine mirror, which,\r\nby its tremulous motion, is, as it were, cut into facets. Each image\r\nwill pass rapidly off in succession, as the day advances, and the stream\r\ncarries down the wave on which it appeared. Thus the parts of this\r\nmoving picture will vanish in the twinkling of an eye. Sometimes the air\r\nis at this time so impregnated with vapors, and undisturbed by winds, as\r\nto reflect objects in a kind of aerial screen, rising about thirty feet\r\nabove the level of the sea. In cloudy, heavy weather, they are drawn on\r\nthe surface of the water, bordered with fine prismatic colors.\r\n\r\nSwinburne, in his travels, cites Father Angelucci as having been the\r\nfirst to describe this phenomenon accurately. His relation is as\r\nfollows. “On the fifteenth of August, 1643, as I stood at my window, I\r\nwas surprised with a most wonderful and delectable vision. The sea which\r\nwashes the Sicilian shore, swelled up, and became, for twelve miles in\r\nlength, like a chain of dark mountains; while the waters near our\r\nCalabrian coast grew quite smooth, and in an instant appeared as one\r\npolished mirror, reclining against the aforesaid ridge. On this glass\r\nwas depicted, in _chiar-oscura_, a string of several thousands of\r\npilasters, all equal in altitude, distance and degree of light and\r\nshade. In a moment they lost half their hight, and bent into arcades,\r\nlike Roman aqueducts. A long cornice was next formed on the top, and\r\nabove it rose castles innumerable, all perfectly alike. These soon split\r\ninto towers, which were shortly after lost in colonnades, then in\r\nwindows, and at last ended in pines, cypresses, and other trees, even\r\nand similar. This was the Fata Morgana, which, for twenty-six years, I\r\nhad thought a mere fable.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                       ATMOSPHERICAL REFRACTION.\r\n\r\nA surprising instance of atmospherical refraction occurred at Hastings,\r\nEngland, on the twenty-sixth of July, 1798. W. Latham, Esq., sitting in\r\nhis dining-room, situated on the parade, close to the sea-shore, and\r\nnearly fronting the south, about five in the afternoon, had his\r\nattention suddenly drawn by a great number of people running down to the\r\nseaside. On inquiring the reason, he was informed that the coast of\r\nFrance was plainly to be distinguished by the naked eye. On going down\r\nto the shore, he was surprised to find that, even without the assistance\r\nof a telescope, he could very plainly see the cliffs on the opposite\r\ncoast; which, at the nearest part, are between forty and fifty miles\r\ndistant, and are not to be discerned, from that low situation, by the\r\naid of the best glasses. They appeared to be only a few miles off, and\r\nseemed to extend for some leagues along the coast. Pursuing his walk\r\nalong the shore to the eastward, close to the water’s edge, and\r\nconversing on the subject with the sailors and fishermen, they could\r\nnot, at first, be persuaded of the reality of the appearance; but soon\r\nbecame so thoroughly convinced, by the cliffs gradually appearing more\r\nelevated, and approaching nearer as it were, that they pointed out and\r\nnamed to him the different places they had been accustomed to visit,\r\nsuch as, the Bay, the Old Head or Man, the Windmill, &c., at Boulogne;\r\ntogether with St. Vallery, and other places on the coast of Picardy.\r\nThis they afterward confirmed, when they viewed them, thus refracted,\r\nthrough their telescopes, observing that the above places appeared as\r\nnear as if they had been sailing, at a small distance, into the harbors.\r\nFrom the eastern cliff, which is of a very considerable hight, a most\r\nbeautiful scene presented itself to Mr. Latham’s view, for there he\r\ncould at once see Dungeness, Dover cliffs, and the French coast, all\r\nalong from Calais, Boulogne, &c., to St. Vallery; and, as some of the\r\nfishermen affirmed, as far to the westward even as Dieppe. By the\r\ntelescope, the French fishing-boats were plainly to be seen at anchor,\r\nand the different colors of the land on the hights, with the buildings,\r\nwere perfectly discernible. This curious phenomenon continued in the\r\nhighest splendor till half past eight o’clock, notwithstanding a black\r\ncloud for some time totally obscured the face of the sun, and then\r\nvanished gradually. So remarkable an instance of atmospherical\r\nrefraction had not been before witnessed by the oldest inhabitant of\r\nHastings. It was likewise observed at Winchelsea, and other places along\r\nthe coast. The day was remarkably hot, without a breath of wind\r\nstirring.\r\n\r\nAs another instance of this refracting power of the atmosphere, Dr.\r\nVince, an English philosopher, was once looking through a telescope at a\r\nship, which was so far off, that he could only see the upper parts of\r\nthe masts. The hulk was entirely hidden by the bending of the water, but\r\nbetween himself and the ship he saw two perfect images of it in the air.\r\nThese were of the same form and color as the real ship; but one of them\r\nwas turned upside down. And when Captain Scoresby was in the polar sea\r\nwith his ship, he was separated by the ice from that of his father for\r\nsome time, and looked out for her every day with great anxiety. At\r\nlength, one evening, to his utter astonishment, he saw her suspended in\r\nthe air, in an inverted position, traced on the horizon in the clearest\r\ncolors, and with the most distinct and perfect representation. He sailed\r\nin the direction in which he saw this visionary phenomenon, and actually\r\nfound his father’s vessel by its indication. He was separated from the\r\nship by immense masses of icebergs, and at such a distance that it was\r\nimpossible to have seen her in her actual situation, or to have seen her\r\nat all, if her spectrum had not been thus raised several degrees above\r\nthe horizon in the air by this most extraordinary refraction. It is by\r\nthis bending of the rays of light that the images of people are often\r\nseen at a distance, and sometimes magnified to a gigantic size. We have\r\ngiven an account of such an appearance in the Hartz mountains, in\r\nGermany.\r\n\r\nAnother singular instance of the refracting power of the atmosphere, was\r\nwitnessed within the present year, (1854,) by Mr. Elliott, the aeronaut,\r\nwhile ascending in his balloon from Petersburg, Virginia. After he had\r\nascended about three thousand feet he discharged some five pounds of\r\nballast, when he shot onward and upward with amazing rapidity till he\r\nbegan to approximate to the clouds. He then discharged about five pounds\r\nmore of sand, the remainder of the bag, when he again darted upward\r\namong the clouds, which were so dense as to wholly exclude all\r\nterrestrial objects from his view, and of course he was lost to all\r\nobservers below. These discharges were distinctly seen by persons\r\nwatching him, and on the first occasion some one exclaimed that the\r\nballoon had burst. While among the clouds, it seemed to him as if he was\r\nin the midst of a large ground-glass globe, some two or three hundred\r\nfeet in diameter, against the side of which opposite to the sun, the\r\nshadow of his balloon rested, some five or six times larger than the\r\ncorporeal one. About half-way between him and the shadow, which seemed\r\nas if resting on the glass wall, another balloon was seen, of a size\r\nbetween the shadow and the real one, resting as if in a vacuum, which\r\ndisplayed every color of the original faithfully. He then saw another\r\nElliott, clad and with features like himself, and seemingly self-like.\r\nHe then extended his own fingers, when he was mimicked by his image; and\r\nwhether he extended one finger or more, or whatever he did, this figure\r\nduplicated exactly. When he would cause his balloon to oscillate, this\r\nballoon would move exactly like his. When he threw out more ballast to\r\nelevate himself, this figure _sank down_ instead of rising with him; and\r\nwhen he arose above the clouds into the rays of the unclouded sun, he\r\nleft the mimic aeronaut below him.\r\n\r\nIn the rays of the sun above the clouds he found it so warm as to cause\r\nhim to perspire freely, a state of heat never before experienced at this\r\nhight, nearly twenty-four thousand feet, where the air is very rarefied\r\nand generally very chilly. He then opened the valve for the purpose of\r\ndescending, and as soon as he had sunk one or two thousand feet, which\r\nhe ascertained by barometrical indications, he felt as if he had entered\r\nan ice-house, and a cold chill seized his whole person. Here he again\r\nmet his mimic aerial voyager, whom he kept in company for some time,\r\nfrom philosophical motives. Whenever he moved sideways, this _mum_\r\ngentleman would move in the same direction. But when he moved up or\r\ndown, the duplicate would move in a directly opposite way; and when he\r\nconcluded to descend, the image moved upward until the tricolored flag\r\nwas out of sight, when he could see the car and the aeronaut still\r\nstanding in it as if in a basket attached to nothing. He continued to\r\nlook until his head was Robespierred, and finally, piece by piece, his\r\nbody, and, at last, his feet and basket, ascended out of his sight. Mr.\r\nElliott said that he had been up a hundred and one times, but never had\r\nseen anything in the form of an illusion like this before.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SHIP REFRACTED IN THE AIR.]\r\n\r\nBut one of the most remarkable cases of atmospheric refraction of which\r\nwe have any record, is that which occurred at New Haven, Connecticut, in\r\nthe early settlement of the colony. The colonists had built a ship, and\r\nfreighted her for England with a valuable cargo, with which she sailed\r\nfrom their harbor in the winter of 1647, having several of their\r\nprincipal men on board. They were obliged to cut their way through the\r\nice to get out of the harbor; and the ship, never being heard of\r\nafterward, was supposed to have foundered at sea. No tidings arriving of\r\nthe ship or of her fate, the colonists were deeply distressed, and “were\r\nvery earnest in their prayers, both public and private, that God would\r\nin some way make manifest to them what had become of their friends.” In\r\nthe following June, a violent thunder-storm arose out of the north-west,\r\nafter which the atmosphere being very calm and serene, about an hour\r\nbefore sunset, a ship of the dimensions and form of the one they had\r\nlost, with all her canvas set and flags flying, appeared in the air,\r\ncoming up the harbor, her sails filled as though by a fresh gale, and\r\nsailing against the wind, for the space of half an hour.\r\n\r\nAt length, as she came nearer, her maintop seemed to be blown off,\r\nthough left hanging in the shrouds; then, her mizzen-top; then all her\r\nmasting seemed blown away by the board; quickly after, her hulk\r\ncareening, she overset, and seemed to sink and vanish in the clouds, and\r\nas these clouds passed away, the air where she was seen, was, as before,\r\nperfectly clear. The crowd of spectators could distinguish the\r\nappearance of the various parts of the ship, the principal rigging, and\r\nsuch proportions as made them satisfied that this was indeed their ship;\r\nand Mr. Davenport, the minister, declared, in public, that God, for the\r\nquieting of the hearts of the people, had given them this extraordinary\r\nexhibition and account of what he had done with their property and\r\nfriends. But science gives us a more natural and less miraculous\r\nexplanation of the matter, in the refracting power of the air when in\r\ncertain states; and the probability is, that the ship, thus seen in the\r\nair, was some strange vessel (which they imagined looked like their own)\r\ncoming up the harbor before the breeze, and then driven off and wrecked\r\nby the storm, which reached her after it had passed New Haven; or else\r\nthat it was, indeed, their own ship, which after being driven about for\r\nmonths, was now coming back to her port, when she was thus caught in the\r\ntempest and destroyed. And as confirming this view of the matter, it may\r\nbe added, in conclusion, that within the present century, it is said, a\r\nsimilar refraction of a ship in the air, has been witnessed in the same\r\nplace.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        PARHELIA, OR MOCK SUNS.\r\n\r\nOn the fifth of February, 1674, near Marienberg, in Prussia, the sky\r\nbeing everywhere serene, the sun, which was still some degrees above the\r\nhorizon, was seen to lance out very long and reddish rays, forty or\r\nfifty degrees toward the zenith, notwithstanding it shone with great\r\nluster. Beneath this planet, toward the horizon, there hung a somewhat\r\nthin small cloud, at the inferior part of which there appeared a mock\r\nsun, of the same apparent size with the true sun, and of a reddish\r\ncolor. Soon after, the true sun descending gradually to the horizon,\r\ntoward the said cloud, the spurious sun beneath it grew clearer and\r\nclearer, in so much that the reddish color in this apparent solar disk\r\nvanished, and it put on the genuine solar light, in proportion as it was\r\napproached by the genuine disk of the sun. The latter, at length, passed\r\ninto the lower counterfeit sun, and thus remained alone. This phenomenon\r\nwas considered the more wonderful, as it was perpendicularly under the\r\nsun, instead of being at its side, as parhelia usually are; not to\r\nmention the color, so different from that which is usual in mock suns,\r\nnor the great length of the tail cast up by the genuine sun, of a far\r\nmore vivid and splendid light than parhelia commonly exhibit. This\r\nappearance was soon followed by an exceedingly intense frost, which\r\nlasted till the twenty-fifth of March, the whole bay being frozen up\r\nfrom the town of Dantzic to Hela in the Baltic sea.\r\n\r\nOn the twenty-eighth of August, 1698, about eight o’clock in the\r\nmorning, there was seen at Sudbury, in Suffolk, England, the appearance\r\nof three suns, which were then extremely brilliant. Beneath a dark,\r\nwatery cloud, in the east, nearly at its center, the true sun shone with\r\nsuch strong beams, that the spectators could not look at it; and on each\r\nside were the reflections. Much of the firmament was elsewhere of an\r\nazure color. The circles were not colored like the rainbow, but white;\r\nand there was also, at the same time, higher in the firmament, and\r\ntoward the south, at a considerable distance from the other phenomena,\r\nthe form of a half-moon, but apparently of double the size, with the\r\nhorns turned upward. This appearance was, within, of a fiery red color,\r\nimitating that of the rainbow. These phenomena faded gradually, after\r\nhaving continued about two hours.\r\n\r\nTwo mock suns, an arc of a rainbow inverted, and a halo, were seen at\r\nLyndon, in the county of Rutland, on the twenty-second of October, 1621,\r\nat eleven in the morning. There had been an =aurora borealis= the\r\npreceding night, with the wind at west-south-west. The two parhelia, or\r\nmock suns, were bright and distinct, and in the usual places, namely, in\r\nthe two intersections of a strong and large portion of a halo, with an\r\nimaginary circle parallel to the horizon, passing through the true sun.\r\nEach parhelion had its tail of a white color, and in direct opposition\r\nto the true sun; that toward the east being some twenty or twenty-five\r\ndegrees long, and that toward the west from ten to twelve degrees, both\r\nnarrowest at the remote ends. The mock suns were evidently red toward\r\nthe sun, but pale or whitish at the opposite sides, as was the halo\r\nalso. Still higher in the heavens, was an arc of a curiously inverted\r\nrainbow, about the middle of the distance between the top of the halo\r\nand the vertex. This arc was as distinct in its colors as the common\r\nrainbow, and of the same breadth. The red color was on the convex, and\r\nthe blue on the concave of the arc, which seemed to be about ninety\r\ndegrees in length, its center being in or near the vertex. On the top of\r\nthe halo was a kind of inverted bright arc. This phenomenon was seen on\r\nthe following day, and, again, on the twenty-sixth. On the eleventh of\r\nthe preceding month, September, a very splendid and remarkable =aurora\r\nborealis=, presenting truly unaccountable motions and removals, was\r\nwitnessed in Rutlandshire, in Northamptonshire, and at Bath.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             LUNAR RAINBOW.\r\n\r\nThis very rare phenomenon was witnessed at Glapwell Hall, in Derbyshire,\r\nEngland, on the twenty-fifth of December, 1710, about eight in the\r\nevening, with a remarkable and very unusual display of colors. The moon\r\nhad passed her full about twenty-four hours, and the evening had been\r\nrainy; but the clouds were dispersed, and the moon then shone quite\r\nclear. This =iris lunaris= had all the colors of the solar iris,\r\nexceedingly beautiful and distinct, only faint in comparison with those\r\nwhich are seen in the day; as must necessarily have been the case, both\r\nfrom the different beams by which it was occasioned, and the disposition\r\nof the medium. What most surprised the observer was the largeness of the\r\narc, which was not so much less than that of the sun, as the different\r\ndimensions of their bodies, and their respective distances from the\r\nearth, seemed to require; but the entireness and beauty of its colors\r\nfurnished a charming spectacle.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          CONCENTRIC RAINBOWS.\r\n\r\nThis extraordinary phenomenon, which is seen at sunrise on the Andes, in\r\nSouth America, was first witnessed by Ulloa and his companions in the\r\nwild heaths of Pambamarca, and is thus described by him. “At day-break\r\nthe whole of the mountain was enveloped in dense clouds, which at\r\nsunrise were dissipated, leaving behind them vapors of so extreme a\r\ntenuity, as not to be distinguishable to the sight. At the side opposite\r\nto that where the sun rose on the mountain, and at the distance of about\r\nsixty yards from the spot where we were standing, the image of each of\r\nus was seen represented as if in a mirror, and three concentric\r\nrainbows, the last or most exterior colors of one of which touched the\r\nfirst of the following one, were centered on each head. Without the\r\nwhole of them, and at an inconsiderable distance, was seen a fourth arc\r\npurely white. They were all perpendicular to the horizon; and in\r\nproportion as any one of us moved from one side to the other, he was\r\naccompanied by the phenomenon, which preserved the same order and\r\ndisposition. What was, however, most remarkable, was this, that although\r\nsix or seven persons were thus standing close together, each of us saw\r\nthe phenomenon as it regarded himself, but did not perceive it in the\r\nothers. This, adds Bouguer, is a kind of apotheosis, in which each of\r\nthe spectators, seeing his head adorned with a glory formed of three or\r\nfour concentric crowns of a very vivid color, each of them presenting\r\nvarieties similar to those of the first rainbow, tranquilly enjoys the\r\nsensible pleasure of reflecting that the brilliant garland he can not\r\ndiscover in the others is destined for himself alone.”\r\n\r\nA similar phenomenon is described by Mr. Hagarth, as having been seen by\r\nhim in Wales, on the thirteenth of February, 1780. His relation is as\r\nfollows. “In ascending, at Rhealt, the mountain which forms the eastern\r\nboundary of the vale of Clwyd, (in Denbighshire,) I observed a rare and\r\ncurious phenomenon. In the road above me, I was struck with the peculiar\r\nappearance of a very white, shining cloud, which lay remarkably close to\r\nthe ground. The sun was near setting, but shone extremely bright: I\r\nwalked up to the cloud, and my shadow was projected into it, its\r\nsuperior part being surrounded, at some distance, by a circle of various\r\ncolors, whose center appeared to be near the situation of the eye, and\r\nwhose circumference extended to the shoulders. This circle was complete,\r\nexcept what the shadow of my body intercepted. It exhibited the most\r\nvivid colors, the red being outermost; and all of them appearing in the\r\nsame order and proportion as they are presented to the view by the\r\nrainbow. It resembled very exactly what in pictures is termed a glory,\r\nsurrounding the heads of saints; not indeed that it exhibited the\r\nluminous radiance that is painted close to the head, but an arch of\r\nconcentric colors placed separately and distinctly from it. As I walked\r\nforward, this glory approached or retired, just as the inequality of the\r\nground shortened or lengthened my shadow. The cloud being sometimes in a\r\nsmall valley below me, sometimes on the same level, or on higher ground,\r\nthe variation of the shadow and glory became extremely striking and\r\nsingular. To add to the beauty of the scene, there appeared, at a\r\nconsiderable distance to the right and left, the arches of a white,\r\nshining bow. These arches were in the form of, and broader than a\r\nrainbow; but were not completely joined into a semicircle above, on\r\naccount of the shallowness of the cloud.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                         THUNDER AND LIGHTNING.\r\n\r\nTo conceive justly of the nature of thunder and lightning, we have only\r\nto view the effects of a common electrical machine, and its apparatus,\r\nin an apartment. These experiments mimic the great, wonderful and\r\nterrific phenomena of nature. The stream, or spark, from the machine to\r\nthe hand, represents the shaft of lightning from the clouds to the\r\nearth; and the snapping noise of the diminutive spark corresponds with\r\nthe explosion produced by the lightning, which we call thunder. In what\r\nmanner the clouds become electrified, and, in short, what is the nature\r\nof electricity itself, our present range of experiments so little\r\nqualify us to determine, that a century will perhaps elapse before a\r\nphilosophical precision can be attained. At present we only know for\r\ncertain that the electrical power displays itself merely on the surface\r\nof bodies; and whether it is a fluid =per se=, a vacuum restoring\r\nitself, or whatever its nature may be, the state of experimental\r\nknowledge does not enable us to determine.\r\n\r\nThe obvious analogy between lightning and electricity, had long been\r\nsuspected, and was placed beyond a doubt by Franklin, who was the first\r\nto conceive the practicability of drawing down lightning from the\r\nclouds. Having found by previous experiments, that the electric fluid is\r\nattracted _by points_, he apprehended that lightning might likewise\r\npossess the same quality; although the effects of the latter would in\r\nthat case surpass those of the former in an astonishing degree. Flashes\r\nof lightning, he likewise observed, are generally seen crooked and\r\nwaving in the air; and the electric spark drawn _from_ an irregular body\r\nat some distance, when it is drawn _by_ an irregular body, or through a\r\nspace in which the best conductors are disposed in an irregular manner,\r\nalways exhibits the same appearance.\r\n\r\nLightning strikes the highest and most pointed objects in its way, in\r\npreference to others, as high hills, trees, spires, masts, &c.; and all\r\npointed conductors receive and throw off the electric fluid more readily\r\nthan those which are terminated by flat surfaces. Lightning is observed\r\nto take the best and readiest conductor; and this is also the case with\r\nelectricity, in the discharge of the Leyden phial; whence Franklin\r\ninferred that, in a thunder-storm, it would be safer for a person to\r\nhave his clothes wet than dry. Lightning burns, dissolves metals, rends\r\nsome particular bodies, such as the roots and branches of trees, strikes\r\npersons with blindness, destroys animal life, deprives magnets of their\r\nvirtue and reverses their poles; and these are well known properties of\r\nelectricity. Lightning not only gives polarity to the magnetic needle,\r\nbut to all bodies which have any portion of iron in them, as brick, &c.;\r\nand, by observing which way the poles of these bodies lie, the direction\r\nin which the stroke has passed may be known with the utmost certainty.\r\n\r\nIn order to demonstrate, by actual experiment, the identity of the\r\nelectric fluid with the matter of lightning, Franklin contrived to bring\r\nlightning from the heavens by means of an electrical kite, which he\r\nraised on the approach of a thunder-storm; and, with the electricity\r\nthus obtained, charged phials, kindled spirits, and performed all other\r\nelectrical experiments, as they are usually exhibited by an excited\r\nglobe or tube. This happened in 1752, a month after the French\r\nelectricians, pursuing the method which he had proposed, had verified\r\nthe same theory; but without any knowledge on his part of what they had\r\ndone. On the following year, he further discovered that the air is\r\nsometimes electrified positively, and sometimes negatively; and that in\r\nthe course of one thunder-storm, the clouds change from positive to\r\nnegative electricity several times. He was not long in perceiving that\r\nthis important discovery was capable of being applied to practical use;\r\nand proposed a method, which he soon accomplished, of securing buildings\r\nfrom being damaged by lightning, by means of conductors, or\r\nlightning-rods, the use of which is now universally known.\r\n\r\nFrom a number of judicious experiments made by him, Signor Beccaria\r\nconcluded that the clouds serve as conductors to convey the electric\r\nfluid from those parts of the earth which are overloaded with it, to\r\nthose where it is exhausted. The same cause by which a cloud is first\r\nraised, from vapors dispersed in atmosphere, draws to it those which are\r\nalready formed, and still continues to form new ones, till the whole\r\ncollected mass extends so far as to reach a part of the earth where\r\nthere is a deficiency of the electric fluid, and where the electric\r\nmatter will discharge itself on the earth. A channel of communication\r\nbeing thus produced, a fresh supply of electric matter is raised from\r\nthe overloaded part, which continues to be conveyed by the medium of the\r\nclouds, till the equilibrium of the fluid is restored between the two\r\nplaces of the earth. He further observes that as the wind constantly\r\nblows from the place where the thunder-cloud proceeds, the sudden\r\naccumulation of such a prodigious quantity of vapors must displace the\r\nair, and repel it on all sides. Indeed, many observations of the descent\r\nof lightning confirm his theory of the mode of its ascent; for it often\r\nthrows before it the parts of conducting bodies, and distributes them\r\nalong the resisting medium through which it must force its passage; and\r\non this principle the longest flashes of lightning seem to be produced,\r\nby its forcing in its way part of the vapors in the air. One of the\r\nchief reasons why the report of these flashes is so much protracted, is\r\nthe vast length of the vacuum made by the passage of the electric\r\nmatter; for although the air collapses the moment after it has passed,\r\nand the vibration, on which the sound depends, commences at the same\r\nmoment, still, when the flash is directed toward the person who hears\r\nthe report, the vibrations excited at the nearer end of the track will\r\nreach his ear much sooner than those from the remote end, and the sound\r\nwill, without any echo or repercussion, continue till all the vibrations\r\nhave successively reached him. The rattling noise of the thunder, which\r\nmakes it seem as if it passed through arches or were variously broken,\r\nis probably owing to the sound being excited among clouds hanging over\r\none another, and the agitated air passing irregularly between them.\r\n\r\nAmong other precautions pointed out by Franklin, he recommends to those\r\nwho happen to be in the fields, at the time of a thunder-storm, to place\r\nthemselves within a few yards of a tree, but not quite near it. Signor\r\nBeccaria, however, cautions persons not to depend on a higher, or, in\r\nall cases, a better conductor than their own body; since, according to\r\nhis repeated observations, the lightning by no means descends in one\r\nundivided track, but bodies of various kinds conduct their share of it\r\nat the same time, in proportion to their quantity and conducting power.\r\nThe late Earl of Stanhope, in his principles of electricity, observes\r\nthat damage may be done by lightning, not only by the main stroke and\r\nlateral explosion, but likewise by what he calls _the returning stroke_;\r\nthat is, by the sudden violent return of that part of the natural share\r\nof electricity of any conducting body, or any combination of conducting\r\nbodies, which had been gradually expelled from such body or bodies\r\nrespectively, by the superinduced elastic electrical pressure of a\r\nthunder-cloud’s electrical atmospheres.\r\n\r\nAmong the awful phenomena of nature, none have excited more terror than\r\nthunder and lightning. It is recorded of several of the profligate Roman\r\nemperors, who had procured themselves to be deified, that when they\r\nheard the thunder, they tremblingly concealed themselves, acknowledging\r\na divine power greater than their own; _a Jupiter thundering in the\r\nheavens_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       REMARKABLE THUNDER-STORMS.\r\n\r\nA few instances in which the effects of these storms have been\r\nparticularly characterized, will be both interesting and instructive.\r\n\r\nThat fermented liquors are apt to be soured and spoiled by thunder, is a\r\nfact well known; but that dried substances should be so acted on, is a\r\nstill more remarkable phenomenon, and not so easy of explanation. It\r\nhappened, however, some years ago, that in the immense granaries of\r\nDantzic, the repositories of the corn, of Polish growth, intended for\r\nexportation, the wheat and rye, which were before dry and sweet, were,\r\nby the effect of a violent thunder-storm in the night, rendered clammy\r\nand stinking, insomuch that it required several weeks to sweeten them\r\nand render them fit for shipping.\r\n\r\nThe effects of a thunder-storm on a house and its furniture, at New\r\nForge, Ireland, on the ninth of August, 1707, were very singular. It was\r\nobserved that the day was, throughout, close, hot and sultry, with\r\nscarcely any wind, until toward evening, when a breeze came on with\r\nmizzling rain, which lasted about an hour. As the air darkened after\r\nsunset, several faint flashes of lightning were seen, and thunder-claps\r\nheard, as at a distance; but between ten and eleven o’clock they became,\r\nin their approach, very violent and terrible, progressively increasing\r\nin their intensity, and coming on with more frequency, until toward\r\nmidnight. A flash of lightning, and a clap of thunder, louder and more\r\ndreadful than all the rest, came simultaneously, and shook and inflamed\r\nthe whole house. The mistress being sensible, at that instant, of a\r\nstrong sulphureous smell in her chamber, and feeling a thick, gross dust\r\nfall on her hands and face as she lay in bed, concluded that part of her\r\nhouse had been thrown down by the thunder, or set on fire by the\r\nlightning. The family being called up, and candles lighted, both the\r\nbed-chamber, and the kitchen beneath it, were found to be filled with\r\nsmoke and dust. A looking-glass in the chamber had been broken with such\r\nviolence, that not a piece of it was to be found of the size of half a\r\ncrown: several of the pieces were stuck in the chamber-door, which was\r\nof oak, as well as on the other side of the room. The edges and corners\r\nof some of the pieces of broken glass were tinged of a light flame\r\ncolor, as if they had been heated by the fire. On the following morning\r\nit was found that the cornice of the chimney next the bed-chamber had\r\nbeen struck off, and a breach twenty inches in breadth, made in the\r\nwall. At this part there was seen on the wall a smutted scar or trace,\r\nas if left by the smoke of a candle, which pointed downward to another\r\npart of the wall, where a similar breach was made. Within the chamber,\r\nthe boards on the back of a large hair trunk, filled with linen, were\r\nforced in, and two-thirds of the linen pierced or cut through, the cut\r\nappearing of a quadrangular figure. Several pieces of muslin and wearing\r\napparel, which lay on the trunk, were dispersed about the room, not in\r\nany way singed or scorched, notwithstanding the hair on the back of the\r\ntrunk, where the breach was made, was singed. In the kitchen, a cat was\r\nfound dead, with its legs extended as in a moving posture, without any\r\nother sign of being hurt, except that the fur was singed a little about\r\nthe rump.\r\n\r\nIn the parish of Samford Courtney, near Oakhampton, in Devon, on the\r\nseventh of October, 1811, about three in the afternoon, a sudden\r\ndarkness came on. Several persons being in the church-porch, a great\r\nfire-ball fell among them, and threw them down in various directions,\r\nbut without any one being hurt. The ringers in the belfry declared that\r\nthey never knew the bells go so heavily, and were obliged to desist from\r\nringing. Looking down from the belfry into the church, they perceived\r\nfour fire-balls, which suddenly burst, and the church was filled with\r\nfire and smoke. One of the congregation received a blow in the neck,\r\nwhich caused him to bleed both at nose and mouth. He observed the fire\r\nand smoke to ascend to the tower, where a large beam, on which one of\r\nthe bells was hung, was broken, and the gudgeon breaking, the bell fell\r\nto the floor. One of the pinnacles of the tower, next the town, was\r\ncarried away, and several of the stones were found near a barn, at a\r\nconsiderable distance from the church.\r\n\r\nOn the fifteenth of December, 1754, a vast body of lightning fell on the\r\ngreat hulk at Plymouth. It burst out a mile or two to the westward of\r\nthe hulk, and rushed toward it with incredible velocity. A portion of\r\nthe derrick (a part of the apparatus which served to hoist in and fix\r\nthe masts of the men-of-war) was cut out, of a diameter of at least\r\neighteen inches, and about fifteen feet in length: this particular piece\r\nwas in three or four places girt with iron hoops, about two inches\r\nbroad, and half an inch thick, which were completely cut in two by the\r\nlightning, as if done by the nicest hand and instrument. The lightning\r\nwas immediately succeeded by a dreadful peal of thunder, and that by a\r\nmost violent shower of hail, the hailstones being as large as nutmegs,\r\nand for the greatest part of the same size and shape.\r\n\r\nAmong the many fatal accidents by lightning which have befallen ships,\r\nthe following is a remarkable instance. In the year 1746, a Dutch ship\r\nlay in the road of Batavia, and was preparing to depart for Bengal. The\r\nafternoon was calm, and toward evening the sails were loosed, to take\r\nadvantage of the wind which then constantly blows from the land. A black\r\ncloud gathered over the hills, and was brought by the wind toward the\r\nship, which it had no sooner reached, than a clap of thunder burst from\r\nit, and the lightning set fire to the maintopsail: this being very dry,\r\nburned with great fury: and thus the rigging and mast were set on fire.\r\nAn attempt was immediately made to cut away the mast, but this was\r\nprevented by the falling of the burnt rigging from the head of the mast.\r\nBy degrees the fire communicated to the other masts, and obliged the\r\ncrew to desert the ship, the hull of which afterward took fire, and\r\nburning down to the powder magazine, the upper part was blown into the\r\nair, and the lower part sunk where the ship was at anchor.\r\n\r\nIn crossing the Atlantic, in the month of November, 1749, the crew of an\r\nEnglish ship observed a large ball of blue fire rolling on the water. It\r\ncame down on them so fast, that before they could raise the main-tack,\r\nthey observed the ball to rise almost perpendicularly, and within a few\r\nyards of the main chains: it went off with an explosion as if hundreds\r\nof cannon had been fired off simultaneously, and left behind it a great\r\nsmell of brimstone. The maintopmast was shattered into a thousand\r\npieces, and splints driven out of the mainmast which stuck in the\r\nmain-deck. Five seamen were knocked down, and one of them greatly burnt,\r\nby the explosion. The fireball was apparently of the size of a large\r\nmillstone, and came from the north-east.\r\n\r\nThe ingenious and indefatigable Professor Richman lost his life on the\r\nsixth of August, 1753, as he was observing, with M. Sokolow, engraver to\r\nthe royal academy of St. Petersburgh, the effects of electricity on his\r\ngnomon, during a thunder-storm. It was ascertained that the lightning\r\nwas more particularly directed into the professor’s apartment, by the\r\nmeans of his electrical apparatus, for M. Sokolow distinctly saw a globe\r\nof blue fire, as large as his clenched hand, jump from the rod of the\r\nright gnomon, toward the forehead of Professor Richman, who at that\r\ninstant was about a foot distant from the rod, observing the electrical\r\nindex. The globe of fire which struck the professor, was attended with a\r\nreport as loud as that of a pistol. The nearest metal wire was broken in\r\npieces, and its fragments thrown on M. Sokolow’s clothes, on which burnt\r\nmarks of their dimensions were left. Half of the glass vessel was broken\r\noff, and the metallic filings it contained thrown about the room. Hence\r\nit is plain that the force of the lightning was collected on the right\r\nrod, which touched the filings of metal in the glass vessel. On\r\nexamining the effects of the lightning in the professor’s chamber, the\r\ndoor-case was found split half through, and the door torn off, and\r\nthrown into the chamber. The lightning therefore seems to have continued\r\nits course along the chain conducted under the ceiling of the apartment.\r\nIn a Latin treatise, published by M. Lomonosow, member of the royal\r\nacademy of sciences of St. Petersburgh, several curious particulars are\r\nmentioned relative to this melancholy catastrophe. At the time of his\r\ndeath, Professor Richman had in his left coat-pocket seventy silver\r\ncoins, called rubles, which were not in the least altered by the\r\naccident which befell him. His clock, which stood in the corner, of the\r\nnext room, between an open window and the door, was stopped; and the\r\nashes from the hearth thrown about the apartment. Many persons without\r\ndoors declared that they actually saw the lightning shoot from the cloud\r\nto the professor’s apparatus at the top of his house. The author, in\r\nspeaking of the phenomena of electricity, observes that he once saw\r\nduring a storm of thunder and lightning, brushes of electrical fire,\r\nwith a hissing noise, communicate between the iron rod of his apparatus\r\nand the sides of his window, and that these were three feet in length,\r\nand a foot in breadth.\r\n\r\nSomewhat analogous to these movements of electricity, are those\r\nconnected with the electric telegraph during the violent thunder-storms\r\nthat so often take place in the summer season. When such storms are\r\nraging, and particularly when the lightning is abundant and near, not\r\nonly is the operation of the telegraph entirely suspended, but sometimes\r\nthe lightning itself passes with great violence over the wires, in some\r\ncases melting and destroying them, and in others passing by them as it\r\ndoes by the lightning-rod, and manifesting its violence chiefly at the\r\npoint of their termination. In some instances, the wires have been\r\ninstantly melted by the electric fluid, and in others the machinery of\r\nthe offices injured or destroyed, while at other times persons have been\r\nstruck, or dwellings set on fire by its power.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              HAIL-STORMS.\r\n\r\nOn the seventeenth of July, 1666, a violent storm of hail fell on the\r\nEnglish coast, in Norfolk and Suffolk. At North Yarmouth the hailstones\r\nwere comparatively small; but at Snapebridge, one was taken up which\r\nmeasured a foot in circumference; at Seckford Hall, one which measured\r\nnine inches; and at Melton, one measuring eight inches. At Friston Hall,\r\none of these hailstones, being put into a balance, weighed two ounces\r\nand a half. At Aldborough, it was affirmed that several of them were as\r\nlarge as turkeys’ eggs. A carter had his head broken by them through a\r\nstiff felt hat: in some places it bled, and in others tumors arose: the\r\nhorses were so pelted that they hurried away his cart beyond all\r\ncommand. The hailstones were white, smooth without, and shining within.\r\n\r\nOn the twenty-fifth of May, 1686, the city of Lille, in Flanders, was\r\nvisited by a tremendous hail-storm. The hailstones weighed from a\r\nquarter of a pound to a pound in weight, and even more. One was observed\r\nto contain in the center a dark brown matter, and being thrown into the\r\nfire, gave a very loud report. Others were transparent, and melted\r\ninstantly before the fire. This storm passed over the city and citadel,\r\nleaving not a whole glass in the windows on the windward side. The trees\r\nwere broken, and some beaten down, and partridges and hares killed in\r\nabundance.\r\n\r\nIn 1697, a horrid black cloud, attended with frequent lightnings and\r\nthunder, coming with a south-west wind out of Caernarvonshire, in Wales,\r\nand passing near Snowdon, was the precursor of a most tremendous\r\nhailstorm. In the part of Denbighshire bordering on the sea, all the\r\nwindows on the weather side were broken by the hailstones discharged\r\nfrom this cloud, and the poultry and lambs, together with a large\r\nmastiff, killed. In the north part of Flintshire, several persons had\r\ntheir heads broken, and were grievously bruised in their limbs. The main\r\nbody of this hail-storm fell on Lancashire, in a right line from\r\nOrmskirk to Blackburn, on the borders of Yorkshire. The breadth of the\r\ncloud was about two miles, within which compass it did incredible\r\ndamage, killing all descriptions of fowl and small creatures, and\r\nscarcely leaving a whole pane of glass in any of the windows where it\r\npassed. What was still worse, it plowed up the earth, and cut off the\r\nblade of the green corn, so as utterly to destroy it, the hailstones\r\nburying themselves in the ground. These hailstones, some of which\r\nweighed five ounces, were of different forms, some round, others\r\nsemi-spherical; some smooth, others embossed and crenulated, like the\r\nfoot of a drinking-glass, the ice being very transparent and hard; but a\r\nsnowy kernel was in the midst of most of them, if not of all. The force\r\nof their fall showed that they descended from a great hight. What was\r\nthought to be most extraordinary in this phenomenon was, that the vapor\r\nwhich disposed the aqueous parts thus to congeal, should have continued\r\nundispersed for so long a tract as upward of sixty miles, and should,\r\nduring this extensive passage, have occasioned so extraordinary a\r\ncoagulation and congelation of the watery clouds, as to increase the\r\nhailstones to so vast a bulk in so short a space as that of their fall.\r\n\r\nOn the fourth of May, 1767, at Hitchin, in Hertfordshire, after a\r\nviolent thunder-storm, a black cloud suddenly arose in the south-west,\r\nabout two o’clock in the afternoon, the wind then blowing strongly in\r\nthe east, and was almost instantly followed by a shower of hail, several\r\nof the hailstones measuring from seven or eight to thirteen or fourteen\r\ninches in diameter. The extremity of the storm fell near Offley, where a\r\nyoung man was killed, and one of his eyes was beaten out of his head,\r\nhis body being in every part covered with bruises. Another person,\r\nnearer to Offley, escaped with his life, but was much bruised. At a\r\nnobleman’s seat in the vicinity, seven thousand squares of glass were\r\nbroken, and great damage was done to all the neighboring houses. The\r\nlarge hailstones fell in such immense quantities, that they tore up the\r\nground, and split many large oaks and other trees, cutting down\r\nextensive fields of rye, and destroying several hundred acres of wheat,\r\nbarley, &c. Their figures were various, some being oval, others round,\r\nothers pointed, and others again flat.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              HURRICANES.\r\n\r\nThe ruin and desolation accompanying a hurricane can scarcely be\r\ndescribed. Like fire, its resistless force rapidly consumes everything\r\nin its track. It is generally preceded by an awful stillness of the\r\nelements, and a closeness and mistiness in the atmosphere, which make\r\nthe sun appear red, and the stars of more than an ordinary magnitude.\r\nBut a dreadful reverse succeeding, the sky is suddenly overcast and\r\nwild; the sea rises at once from a profound calm into mountains; the\r\nwind rages and roars like the noise of cannon; the rain descends in a\r\ndeluge; a dismal obscurity envelops the earth with darkness; and the\r\nsuperior regions appear rent with lightning and thunder. The earth, on\r\nthese occasions, often does, and always seems to tremble, while terror\r\nand consternation distract all nature: birds are carried from the woods\r\ninto the ocean; and those whose element is the sea, fly for refuge to\r\nthe land. The affrighted animals in the fields assemble together, and\r\nare almost suffocated by the impetuosity of the wind, in searching for\r\nshelter, which, when found, serves them only for destruction. The roofs\r\nof houses are carried to vast distances from their walls, which are\r\nbeaten to the ground, burying their inmates beneath them. Large trees\r\nare torn up by the roots, and huge branches shivered off, and driven\r\nthrough the air in every direction, with immense velocity. Every tree\r\nand shrub that withstands the shock, is stripped of its boughs and\r\nfoliage. Plants and grass are laid flat to the earth. Luxuriant spring\r\nis in a moment changed to dreary winter. This direful tragedy ended,\r\nwhen it happens in a town, the devastation is surveyed with accumulated\r\nhorror: the harbor is covered with wrecks of boats and vessels; and the\r\nshore has not a vestige of its former state remaining. Mounds of rubbish\r\nand rafters in one place; heaps of earth and trunks of trees in another;\r\ndeep gullies from torrents of water; and the dead and dying bodies of\r\nmen, women and children, half-buried, and scattered about, where streets\r\nbut a few hours before were, present to the miserable survivors a\r\nshocking conclusion of a spectacle, often followed by famine, and, when\r\naccompanied by an earthquake, by mortal diseases. Such is the true and\r\nterrific picture of a hurricane in the West Indies, as drawn by an\r\nactual observer.\r\n\r\nOn the Indian coast, hurricanes are both frequent and disastrous. On the\r\nsecond of October, 1746, the French squadron, commanded by Le\r\nBourdonnai, being at anchor in Madras roads, a hurricane came on which\r\nin a few hours destroyed nearly the whole of the fleet, together with\r\ntwenty other ships belonging to different nations. One of the French\r\nships foundered in an instant, and only six of the crew were saved. On\r\nthe thirtieth of December, 1760, during the siege of Pondicherry, a\r\ntremendous hurricane drove ashore and wrecked three British ships\r\nbelonging to the besieging squadron: the crews were saved. On the\r\ntwentieth of October of the following year, 1761, the British fleet,\r\nthen lying in Madras roads, had to encounter a violent hurricane. The\r\nmen-of-war put to sea, and were thus providentially saved; but all the\r\nvessels which still lay at anchor were lost, and scarcely a soul on\r\nboard saved. On the twenty-ninth of October, 1768, another hurricane\r\nwas, on the coast of Coromandel, fatal to the Chatham Indiaman, which\r\nneglected to put to sea.\r\n\r\nIn the West Indies, a tremendous hurricane on the twenty-first of\r\nOctober, 1817, was particularly severe at the island of St. Lucie. All\r\nthe vessels in the port were entirely lost. The government-house was\r\nblown down, and all within its walls, comprising the governor, his lady\r\nand child, his staff, secretaries, servants, &c., amounting to about\r\nthirty persons, were buried in its ruins: not one survived the dreadful\r\naccident; and still more horrid to relate, the barracks of the officers\r\nand soldiers were demolished, and all within them (about two hundred\r\npersons) lost. All the estates on the island were reduced to a heap of\r\nashes. At Dominica, nearly the whole of the town was inundated, with an\r\nimmense destruction of property.\r\n\r\nIn Great Britain, a dreadful hurricane, commonly called the great storm,\r\nset in at ten at night on the twenty-sixth of November, 1703, and raged\r\nviolently until seven the next morning. It extended its ravages to every\r\npart of the kingdom. In the capital, upward of two thousand stacks of\r\nchimneys were blown down. The lead on the tops of several churches was\r\nrolled up like skins of parchment. Many houses were leveled with the\r\nground, and by the fall of the ruins, twenty-one persons were killed,\r\nand more than two hundred wounded. The ships in the Thames broke from\r\ntheir moorings: four hundred wherries were lost, and many barges sunk,\r\nwith a great loss of lives. At sea the destruction was still greater:\r\ntwelve ships of war, with upward of eighteen hundred men on board, were\r\ntotally lost, together with many merchantmen.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             THE MONSOONS.\r\n\r\nThe setting in of the monsoon, or tropical sea-wind, in the East Indies,\r\nis thus described by Forbes in his “Oriental Memoirs.” The scene was at\r\nBaroche, where the British army was encamped. “The shades of evening\r\napproached as we reached the ground, and just as the encampment was\r\ncompleted, the atmosphere grew suddenly dark, the heat became\r\noppressive, and an unusual stillness presaged the immediate setting in\r\nof the monsoon. The whole appearance of nature resembled those solemn\r\npreludes to earthquakes and hurricanes in the West Indies, from which\r\nthe east in general is providentially free. We were allowed very little\r\ntime for conjecture; in a few minutes the heavy clouds burst over us. I\r\nhad witnessed seventeen monsoons in India, but this exceeded them all in\r\nits awful appearance and dreadful effects. Encamped in a low situation,\r\non the borders of a lake formed to collect the surrounding water, we\r\nfound ourselves in a few hours in a liquid plain. The tent-pins giving\r\nway, in a loose soil, the tents fell down, and left the whole army\r\nexposed to the contending elements. It requires a lively imagination to\r\nconceive the situation of a hundred thousand human beings of every\r\ndescription, with more than two hundred thousand elephants, camels,\r\nhorses and oxen, suddenly overwhelmed by this dreadful storm, in a\r\nstrange country, without any knowledge of high or low ground; the whole\r\nbeing covered by an immense lake, and surrounded by thick darkness,\r\nwhich prevented our distinguishing a single object, except such as the\r\nvivid glare of lightning displayed in horrible forms. No language can\r\ndescribe the wreck of a large encampment thus instantaneously destroyed,\r\nand covered with water, and this amid the cries of old men and helpless\r\nwomen, terrified by the piercing shrieks of their expiring children,\r\nunable to afford them relief. During this dreadful night, more than two\r\nhundred persons and three thousand cattle perished, and the morning dawn\r\nexhibited a shocking spectacle.”\r\n\r\nThe south-west monsoon generally sets in very early in certain parts of\r\nIndia. “At Anjengo,” observes the above author, “it commences with great\r\nseverity, and presents an awful spectacle; the inclement weather\r\ncontinues, with more or less violence, from May to October: during that\r\nperiod, the tempestuous ocean rolls from a black horizon, literally of\r\n‘darkness visible,’ a series of floating mountains heaving under hoary\r\nsummits, until they approach the shore, when their stupendous\r\naccumulations flow in successive surges, and break upon the beach; every\r\nninth wave is observed to be generally more tremendous than the rest,\r\nand threatens to overwhelm the settlement. The noise of these billows\r\nequals that of the loudest cannon, and, with the thunder and lightning,\r\nso frequent in the rainy season, is truly awful. During the tedious\r\nmonsoon I passed at Anjengo, I often stood upon the trembling sand-bank,\r\nto contemplate the solemn scene, and derive comfort from that sublime\r\nand omnipotent decree, ‘Hitherto shalt thou come, but no further; and\r\nhere shall thy proud waves be stayed!’”\r\n\r\n\r\n                      WHIRLWINDS AND WATERSPOUTS.\r\n\r\n                               “The dreadful spout\r\n               Which shipmen do the hurricano call\r\n               Constring’d in mass by the almighty sun.”\r\n                  SHAKSPEARE (_Troilus and Cressida_.)\r\n\r\nIn number three hundred and two of the Monthly Magazine, Sir Richard\r\nPhillips, in describing a waterspout observed by him, points out the\r\nconnection between those phenomena and hurricanes, and offers a very\r\nphilosophical explanation of the formation of the former. It happened to\r\nhim, he observes, on the twenty-seventh of June, 1817, about seven in\r\nthe evening, to witness the formation, operation and extinction of what\r\nis called a waterspout. His attention was drawn to a sudden hurricane\r\nwhich nearly tore up the shrubs and vegetables in the western gardens,\r\nand filled the air with leaves and small collections of the recently cut\r\ngrass. Very dark clouds had collected over the adjacent country, and\r\nsome stormy rain, accompanied by several strokes of lightning, followed\r\nthis hurricane of wind. The violence lasted a few minutes, and it was\r\nevident that a whirlwind agitated a variety of substances which had been\r\nraised into the air. The storm proceeded from west to east, that is,\r\nfrom Hampstead over Kentish-Town, toward Holloway. In about five\r\nminutes, in the direction of the latter place, a magnificent projection\r\nwas visible from the clouds, somewhat like a tunnel, with the smallest\r\npart downward. It descended two-thirds of the distance from the clouds\r\ntoward the earth, and evidently consisted of parts of clouds descending\r\nin a vortex, violently agitated like smoke from the chimney of a furnace\r\nrecently supplied with fuel. It then shortened, and appeared to be drawn\r\nup toward the stratum of clouds, and finally drew itself into the cloud;\r\nbut a small cone, or projecting thread, of varying size and length,\r\ncontinued for ten minutes. At the time, and for half an hour after, a\r\nsevere storm of rain was visibly falling from the ruins of clouds\r\nconnected with it, the extent being exactly defined by the breadth of\r\nHolloway, Highgate and Hornsey. About two hours after, it was found that\r\none of the heaviest torrents of rain remembered by the inhabitants, had\r\nfallen around the foot of Highgate hill; and some persons having seen\r\nthe projected cloud, an absolute belief existed that a waterspout had\r\nburst at the crossing of the new and old roads. On proceeding toward\r\nLondon, various accounts agreeing with the superstition or preconceived\r\nnotions of the bystanders were given; and at one place it appeared that\r\nsome haymakers were stacking hay from a wagon which stood between two\r\nricks, and that the same whirlwind which passed over Kentish-Town, had\r\npassed over the loaded wagon with an impetus sufficient to carry it\r\nabout twenty yards from its station, and to put the men on it and on the\r\nrick, in fear of their lives. Passing the road, it carried with it a\r\nstream of hay, and, nearly unroofing a shed on the other side, filled\r\nthe air to a great hight with fragments of hay, leaves and boughs of\r\ntrees, which resembled a vast flight of birds. A family in the vicinity\r\nbeheld the descending cloud, or waterspout, pass over, and saw its\r\ntrain, which, at the time, they took to be a flight of birds. They\r\nafterward beheld the descending cloud draw itself upward, and they and\r\nother witnesses described it as a vast mass of smoke working about in\r\nagitation; to them it was nearly vertical in a northern direction; and\r\nto persons a quarter of a mile north, it was nearly vertical in a\r\nsouthern direction; and all agree that it drew itself up without rain,\r\nand was followed near the earth by the train of light bodies. It\r\nappeared also, on various testimony, to let itself down in a gradual and\r\nhesitating manner, beginning with a sort of knob in the cloud, and then\r\ndescending lower, and curling and twisting about till it shortened, and\r\ngradually drew itself into the cloud.\r\n\r\nThe inferences which Sir Richard draws from what he saw and heard, are\r\nas follows. That the phenomenon called a waterspout is a mere collection\r\nof clouds, of the same rarity as the mass whence they are drawn. That\r\nthe descent is a mechanical effect of the whirlwind, which creating a\r\nvacuum, or high degree of rarefaction, extending between the clouds and\r\nthe earth, the clouds descend in it by their gravity, or by the pressure\r\nof the surrounding clouds or air. That the convolutions of the\r\ndescending mass, and the sensible whirlwind felt at the earth, as well\r\nas the appearance of the commencement, increase and decrease of the\r\nmass, all demonstrate the whirl of the air to be the mechanical cause.\r\nThat the same vortex, whirl or eddy of the air, which occasions the\r\nclouds to descend, occasions the loose bodies on the earth to ascend.\r\nThat, if in this case the lower surface had been water, the same\r\nmechanical power would have raised a body of foam, vapor and water,\r\ntoward the clouds. That, as soon as the vortex or whirl exhausts or\r\ndissipates itself, the phenomena terminate by the fall to the lower\r\nsurface of the light bodies or water, and by the ascent of the cloud.\r\nThat when water constitutes the light body of the lower surface, it is\r\nprobable that the aqueous vapor of the cloud, by coalescing with it, may\r\noccasion the clouds to condense, and fall at that point, as through a\r\nsiphon. That if the descending cloud be highly electrified, and the\r\nvortex pass over a conducting body, as a church steeple, it is probable\r\nit may be condensed by an electrical concussion, and fall at that spot,\r\ndischarging whatever has been taken up from the lower surface, and\r\nproducing the strange phenomena of showers of frogs, fish, &c. And,\r\nlastly, it appears certain, that the action of the air on the mass of\r\nclouds, pressing toward the mouth of the vortex as to a funnel, (which,\r\nin this case, it exactly represented,) occasioned such a condensation as\r\nto augment the simultaneous fall of rain to a prodigy.\r\n\r\nIn the month of July, 1800, a waterspout was seen rapidly to approach a\r\nship navigating between the Lipari islands. It had the appearance of a\r\nviscid fluid, tapering in its descent, and proceeding from the cloud to\r\njoin the sea. It moved at the rate of about two miles an hour, with a\r\nloud sound of rain, passing the stern of the ship, and wetting the after\r\npart of the mainsail. It was thence concluded that waterspouts are not\r\ncontinuous columns of water, which has been confirmed by subsequent\r\nobservations.\r\n\r\nIn November, 1801, about twenty miles from Trieste, in the Adriatic sea,\r\na waterspout was seen eight miles to the southward: round its lower\r\nextremity was a mist, twelve feet high, nearly of the form of an Ionian\r\ncapital, with very large volutes, the spout resting obliquely on its\r\ncrown. At some distance from this spout, the sea began to be agitated,\r\nand a mist rose to the hight of about four feet: a projection then\r\ndescended from the black cloud which was impending, and met the\r\nascending mist about twenty feet above the sea, the last ten yards of\r\nthe distance being described with great rapidity. A cloud of a light\r\ncolor appeared to ascend in this cloud like quicksilver in a glass tube.\r\nThe first spout then snapped at about one-third of its hight, the\r\ninferior part subsiding gradually, and the superior curling upward.\r\nSeveral other projections from the cloud, appeared with corresponding\r\nagitations of the water below, but not always in spouts vertically under\r\nthem: seven spouts in all were formed, and two other projections\r\nreabsorbed. Some of the spouts were not only oblique, but curved, the\r\nascending cloud moving most rapidly in those which were vertical. They\r\nlasted from three to five minutes, and their dissipation was not\r\nattended with any fall of rain. For some days before the weather had\r\nbeen very rainy, with a south-east wind, but not any rain had fallen on\r\nthe day of observation.\r\n\r\nIn some cases, however, the waterspout at sea, is a continuous column of\r\nwater, carried upward from the surface of the waves, and possibly\r\nmeeting with water brought down from the clouds and condensed by the\r\nforce of the revolving hurricane. Such waterspouts are now and then seen\r\non the ocean, having an appearance like that represented in the cut on\r\nthe next page. And as the wind blows first this way, and then that, they\r\noften writhe and bend, from one point to another, while the sea below,\r\nand all around, is agitated and covered with foam. Woe to that vessel\r\nthat comes within the reach of one of these mighty phenomena. It would\r\nbe crushed and sunk like a leaf on the waters. The usual defense at sea\r\nis to fire a cannon-shot into the whirling waterspout, which commonly\r\nbreaks and dispels it, and causes the water to fall in a tremendous\r\ncataract or shower.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WATERSPOUT ON THE OCEAN.]\r\n\r\nWaterspouts, however, are not confined to the ocean. They are\r\noccasionally witnessed on the great fresh-water lakes of our own\r\ncountry, as they have been on the inland seas of other parts of the\r\nglobe. Several of these remarkable phenomena were seen in 1854, on Lake\r\nOntario, two of which were visible at Sodus point. They were dense,\r\ncone-shaped columns, and formed a continuous line from the earth to the\r\nclouds. One of them, the largest, which was nearly thirty feet in\r\ndiameter, was precipitated against the bluffs, and broke with a\r\ndeafening noise upon the rocks below, causing so great a commotion of\r\nthe waters that a large quantity of logs and lumber were torn from their\r\nmoorings and washed far out into the lake. The smaller of the two\r\npursued its terrific and onward course as far as the eye could reach,\r\nfilling the beholders with wonder and astonishment, and awakening such a\r\nfeeling of grandeur and sublimity that they stood almost mute and\r\nstatue-like, until the sound of this gigantic column of water died far\r\naway in the distance. A portion of the pier of the light-house was swept\r\naway by the elements, and considerable damage was done to the\r\nlight-house. There was a severe storm out on the lake, and several\r\nschooners, brigs, &c., came scudding in, under bare poles, seeking\r\nsecurity from the tempestuous billows without, upon the placid bosom of\r\nthe harbor. The velocity and power of the whirlwind which caused these\r\nwaterspouts, were very great. As it passed on westward in its furious\r\ncourse, it is said that in a town in Ohio, a grove of oak-trees was\r\nalmost entirely blown down by it. The trunk of one of these trees, on\r\nbeing measured, was found to be about three feet in diameter. Assuming,\r\nhowever, that its diameter was but two and a half feet, it would require\r\nto break it, a force of one hundred and forty-nine thousand pounds. The\r\nsurface of the tree exposed to the action of the wind, was about one\r\nthousand square feet, which would give a pressure by the wind of one\r\nhundred and forty-seven pounds to the square foot, or a velocity of not\r\nless than one hundred and seventy-one miles per hour, which is nearly\r\none-fourth the velocity of a cannon-ball just leaving the cannon.\r\nAllowing the hight of the hurricane or whirlwind to have been sixty\r\nfeet, the whole force exerted, at one time, along its track, was equal\r\nto more than half the steam power of the globe!\r\n\r\nThese corresponding phenomena of whirlwinds have been occasionally\r\nproductive of much mischief, as the following brief narratives will\r\nshow. On the thirtieth of October, 1669, about six in the evening, the\r\nwind being then westwardly, a formidable whirlwind, scarcely of the\r\nbreadth of sixty yards, and which spent itself in about seven minutes,\r\narose at Ashly, in Northamptonshire, England. Its first assault was on a\r\nmilkmaid, whose pail and hat were taken from off her head, and the\r\nformer carried many scores of yards from her, where it lay undiscovered\r\nfor some days. It next stormed a farmyard, where it blew a wagon body\r\noff the axletrees, breaking in pieces the latter, and the wheels, three\r\nof which, thus shattered, were blown over a wall. Another wagon, which\r\ndid not, like the former, lie across the passage of the wind, was driven\r\nwith great speed against the side of the farm-house. A branch of an\r\nash-tree, so large that two stout men could scarcely lift it, was blown\r\nover a house without damaging it, although torn from a tree one hundred\r\nyards distant. A slate was carried nearly two hundred yards, and forced\r\nagainst a window, the iron bar of which it bent. Several houses were\r\nstripped; and in one instance, this powerful gust, or stream of air,\r\nforced open a door, breaking the latch; whence it passed through the\r\nentry, and, forcing open the dairy door, overturned the milk-pans, and\r\nblew out three panes of glass. It next ascended to the chambers, and\r\nblew out nine other panes. Lastly, it blew a gate-post, fixed two feet\r\nand a half in the ground, out of the earth, and carried it many yards\r\ninto the fields.\r\n\r\nOn the thirtieth of October, 1731, at one in the morning, a very sudden\r\nand terrific whirlwind, having a breadth of two hundred yards, was\r\nexperienced at Cerne-Abbas, in Dorsetshire. From the south-west side of\r\nthe town, it passed to the north-east, crossing the center, and\r\nunroofing the houses in its progress. It rooted up trees, broke others\r\nin the middle, of at least a foot square, and carried the tops a\r\nconsiderable distance. A sign-post, five feet by four, was broken off\r\nsix feet in the pole, and carried across a street forty feet in breadth,\r\nover a house opposite. The pinnacles and battlements of one side of the\r\nchurch-tower were thrown down, and the leads and timber of the north\r\naisle broken in by their fall. A short time before, the air was\r\nremarkably calm. It was estimated that this sudden and terrible gust did\r\nnot last more than two minutes.\r\n\r\nAbout the middle of August, 1741, at ten in the morning, several\r\npeasants being on a heath near Holkham, in Norfolk, perceived, about a\r\nquarter of a mile from them, a wind like a whirlwind approach them\r\ngradually, in a straight line from east to west. It passed through the\r\nfield where they were plowing, and tore up the stubble and grass in the\r\nplowed ground, for two miles in length, to the breadth of thirty yards.\r\nIn reaching an inclosure at the top of a rising ground, it appeared like\r\na great flash or ball of fire, emitting smoke, and accompanied by a\r\nnoise similar to that of carts passing over a stony ground. Both before\r\nand after the wind passed, there was a strong smell of sulphur; and the\r\nnoise was heard long after the smoke had been perceived. This fiery\r\nwhirlwind moved so slowly forward, that it was nearly ten minutes in\r\nproceeding from the inclosure to a farm-house in the vicinity, where it\r\ndid much mischief.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           SOUNDS AND ECHOES.\r\n\r\nSound is propagated successively from the sounding body to the places\r\nwhich are nearest to it, then to those more distant, &c. Every observer\r\nknows that when a gun is fired at a considerable distance from him, he\r\nperceives the flash a certain time before he hears the report; and the\r\nsame thing is true with respect to the stroke of a hammer, or of a\r\nhatchet, the fall of a stone, or, in short, any visible action which\r\nproduces a sound or sounds. In general, sound travels through the air at\r\nthe rate of eleven hundred and forty-two feet in a second, or about\r\nthirteen miles in a minute. This is the case with all kinds of sounds;\r\nthe softest whisper flying as fast as the loudest thunder. Sound, like\r\nlight, after it has been reflected from several places, may be collected\r\ninto one point as a focus, where it will be more audible than in any\r\nother part; and on this principle whispering galleries are constructed.\r\nThe particulars relative to the celebrated whispering gallery in the\r\ndome of St. Paul’s church, London, will be comprehended in the\r\ndescription of that noble edifice.\r\n\r\nAn echo is the reflection of sound striking against a surface adapted to\r\nthe purpose, as the side of a house, a brick wall, hill, &c., and\r\nreturning back again to the ear, at distinct intervals of time. If a\r\nperson stand about sixty-five or seventy feet from such a surface, and\r\nperpendicularly to it, and speak, the sound will strike against the\r\nwall, and be reflected back, so that he will hear it as it goes to the\r\nwall, and again on its return. If a bell situated in the same way be\r\nstruck, and an observer stand between the bell and the reflecting\r\nsurface, he will hear the sound going to the wall, and also on its\r\nreturn. Lastly, if the sound strike the wall obliquely, it will go off\r\nobliquely, so that a person who stands in a direct line between the bell\r\nand the wall will not hear the echo. According to the greater or less\r\ndistance from the speaker, a reflecting object will return the echo of\r\nseveral, or of fewer syllables; for all the syllables must be uttered\r\nbefore the echo of the first syllable reaches the ear, to prevent the\r\nconfusion which would otherwise ensue. In a moderate way of speaking,\r\nabout three and a half syllables are pronounced in one second, or seven\r\nsyllables in two seconds: therefore, when an echo repeats seven\r\nsyllables, the reflecting object is eleven hundred and forty-two feet\r\ndistant; for sound travels at the rate of eleven hundred and forty-two\r\nfeet per second, and the distance from the speaker to the reflecting\r\nobject, and again from the latter to the former, is twice eleven hundred\r\nand forty-two feet. When the echo returns fourteen syllables, the\r\nreflecting object must be twenty-two hundred and eighty-four feet\r\ndistant, and so on.\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable echo recorded, is at the palace of a nobleman,\r\nwithin two miles of Milan, in Italy. The building is of some length in\r\nfront, and has two wings jutting forward; so that it wants only one side\r\nof an oblong figure. About one hundred paces before the mansion, a small\r\nbrook glides gently; and over this brook is a bridge forming a\r\ncommunication between the mansion and the garden. A pistol having been\r\nfired at this spot, fifty-six reiterations of the report were heard. The\r\nfirst twenty were distinct; but in proportion as the sound died away,\r\nand was answered at a greater distance, the repetitions were so doubled\r\nthat they could scarcely be counted, the principal sound appearing to be\r\nsaluted in its passage by reports on either side at the same time. A\r\npistol of a larger caliber having been afterward discharged, and\r\nconsequently with a louder report, sixty distinct reiterations were\r\ncounted. From this example it follows, that the further the reflecting\r\nsurface is, the greater number of syllables the echo will repeat; but\r\nthat the sound will be enfeebled nearly in the same proportion, until at\r\nlength the syllables can not be distinctly heard. On the other hand,\r\nwhen the reflecting object is too near, the repetition of the sound\r\nreaches the ear, whilst the perception of the original sound still\r\ncontinues, in which case an indistinct resounding is heard, as may be\r\nobserved in empty rooms, passages, &c. In such places, several\r\nreflections from the walls to the hearer, as also from one wall to the\r\nother, and then to the hearer, clash with each other, and increase the\r\nindistinctness of the sound.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             BURIED CITIES.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     THE YANAR, OR PERPETUAL FIRE.\r\n\r\nBefore passing on to the buried cities of Herculaneum and Pompeii, it\r\nmay be as well to notice a singular phenomenon, supposed by some to be\r\nof volcanic origin, _viz._, the Yanar, or perpetual fire. Captain\r\nBeaufort, of the British navy, among the interesting details of his\r\nsurvey of Karamania, on the south coast of Asia Minor, describes this\r\ncurious phenomenon; and from his account the following particulars are\r\nextracted, as supplementary to and connected with the details of\r\nvolcanoes and their effects.\r\n\r\nHaving perceived during the night a small but steady light among the\r\nhills, he found that this was represented by the inhabitants as a\r\n_yanar_ or _volcanic light_; and on the following morning curiosity led\r\nhim to visit the spot. In the inner corner of a ruined building he came\r\nto a wall, so undermined as to leave an aperture of about three feet in\r\ndiameter, and shaped like the mouth of an oven. From this aperture the\r\nflame issued, giving out an intense heat, but without producing any\r\nsmoke on the wall; and although several small lumps of caked soot were\r\ndetached from the neck of the opening, the walls were scarcely\r\ndiscolored. Trees, brushwood and weeds, grew close around this little\r\ncrater; a small stream trickled down the hill in its vicinity; and the\r\nground did not appear to feel the effect of its heat at more than a few\r\nyards’ distance. No volcanic productions were perceived near to it; but\r\nat a short distance, lower down on the side of the hill, was another\r\nhole or aperture, which had apparently been at some remote period the\r\nvent of a similar flame. It was asserted, however, by the guide, that,\r\nin the memory of the present race of inhabitants, there had been but one\r\nsuch volcanic opening, and that its size and appearance had been\r\nconstantly the same. He added, that it was never accompanied by\r\nearthquakes or noises; and that it did not eject either stones, smoke or\r\nnoxious vapors; but that its brilliant and perpetual flame could not be\r\nquenched by any quantity of water. At this flame, he observed, the\r\nshepherds were in the habit of cooking their food. This phenomenon\r\nappeared to Captain Beaufort to have existed for many ages, and he was\r\npersuaded that it is the spot to which Pliny alludes in the following\r\npassage: “Mount Chimera, near Phaselis, emits an unceasing flame, which\r\nburns day and night.” Within a short distance is the great mountain of\r\nTakhtalu, the naked summit of which rises, in an insulated peak,\r\nseventy-eight hundred feet above the level of the sea. In the month of\r\nAugust a few streaks of snow were discernible on the peak; but many of\r\nthe distant mountains of the interior were completely white for nearly a\r\nfourth the way down their sides. It may hence be inferred, that the\r\nelevation of this part of Mount Taurus is not less than ten thousand\r\nfeet, which is equal to that of Mount Etna.\r\n\r\nSuch a striking feature as this stupendous mountain, in a country\r\ninhabited by illiterate and credulous people, can not fail to have been\r\nthe subject of numerous tales and traditions. Accordingly, the captain\r\nwas informed by the peasants, that there is a perpetual flow of the\r\npurest water from the very apex; and that notwithstanding the snow,\r\nwhich was still lingering in the chasms, roses blew there all the year\r\nround. He was assured by the agha of Deliktash, that every autumn a\r\nmidnight groan is heard to issue from the summit of the mountain, louder\r\nthan the report of any cannon, but unaccompanied by fire or smoke. The\r\nagha professed his ignorance of the cause, but on being pressed for his\r\nopinion, gravely replied, that he believed it was an annual summons to\r\nthe elect, to make the best of their way to Paradise. However amusing\r\nthis theory may have been, it may possibly be true that such explosions\r\ntake place. The mountain artillery heard by Lewis and Clarke, among the\r\nRocky mountains, and similar phenomena which are said to have occurred\r\nin South America, seem to lend some probability to the account. The\r\nnatives have also a tradition, that when Moses fled from Egypt, he took\r\nup his abode near this mountain, which was therefore named Moossa-Daghy,\r\nor the mountain of Moses. Between this story, and the Yanar, as it has\r\nbeen described above, may there not have been some fanciful connection?\r\nThe site of this volcanic opening is at an inconsiderable distance from\r\nthe mountain; and the flame issuing from the thicket which surrounds it,\r\nmay have led to some confused association with the burning bush on Mount\r\nHoreb, of which we have the account in the book of Exodus.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                POMPEII.\r\n\r\nTo every traveler through the southern part of Europe, Pompeii and\r\nHerculaneum are, of course, the objects of earliest attention and\r\ndeepest interest. The tragic story of these buried towns is now familiar\r\nto most intelligent persons; while the vivid romance of Bulwer makes one\r\nfeel as if he had known the inhabitants, and almost as though he had\r\nbeen a witness of the catastrophe. The story is recorded not more\r\nfaithfully by the younger Pliny, in his celebrated letter to Tacitus,\r\nthan it is plainly read in the material evidence, whose unexpected\r\ndiscovery, almost in our own day, has supplied both to the antiquarian\r\nand the geologist, most valued and truthful evidences; contemporary\r\nrecords, expounding to the antiquary an interesting chapter of human\r\nhistory, filled with the minutest details of personal interest, and to\r\nthe geologist, the close of one and the commencement of another of those\r\ngreat cycles of change, whose history, strangely connected in this\r\ninstance with the vicissitudes of his own race, engrosses his delighted\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nA great and rich town, which, after sleeping eighteen centuries in its\r\ndeep and dark grave, is again shone on by the sun, and stands among\r\nother cities as much a stranger to them as any one of its former\r\ninhabitants would be among men of the present day, is surely one of the\r\nwonders of the world; and such is Pompeii. The distance from Naples to\r\nPompeii, is little more than ten English miles. Near the Torre\r\ndell’Annunziata, to the left, and amid hills planted with vineyards, the\r\ntown itself, which, throwing off its shroud of ashes, came forth from\r\nits grave, breaks on the view. The buildings are without roofs, which\r\nare supposed to have been destroyed by the lava, or torn off by the\r\nhurricane which preceded it. The tracks of the wheels which anciently\r\nrolled over the pavement are still visible. An elevated path runs by the\r\nside of the houses, for foot-passengers; and, to enable them in rainy\r\nweather to pass more commodiously to the opposite side, large flat\r\nstones, three of which take up the width of the road, were laid at a\r\ndistance from each other. As the carriages, in order to avoid these\r\nstones, were obliged to use the intermediate spaces, the tracks of the\r\nwheels are there most visible. The whole of the pavement is in good\r\ncondition: it consists merely of considerable pieces of lava, which,\r\nhowever, are not cut as at present into squares, and may have been on\r\nthat account the more durable.\r\n\r\nThe part which was first cleared, is supposed to have been the main\r\nstreet of Pompeii; but this is much to be doubted, as the houses on both\r\nsides, with the exception of a few, were evidently the habitations of\r\ncommon citizens, and were small and provided with booths. The street\r\nitself likewise is narrow: two carriages only could go abreast; and it\r\nis very uncertain whether it ran through the whole of the town; for,\r\nfrom the spot where the moderns discontinued digging, to that where they\r\nrecommenced, and where the same street is supposed to have been again\r\nfound, a wide tract is covered with vineyards, which may perhaps occupy\r\nthe places of the most splendid streets and markets, still concealed\r\nunderneath.\r\n\r\nAmong the objects which attract particular attention, is a booth in\r\nwhich liquors were sold; the marble table within which, bears the marks\r\nof the cups left by the drinkers. Next to this is a house, the threshold\r\nof which is inlaid with a salutation in black stone, as a token of\r\nhospitality. On entering the habitations, the visitor is struck by the\r\nstrangeness of their construction. The middle of the house forms a\r\nsquare, something like the cross passages of a cloister, often\r\nsurrounded by pillars: it is cleanly, and paved with party-colored\r\nmosaic, which has an agreeable effect. In the middle is a cooling well,\r\nand on each side a little chamber, about ten or twelve feet square, but\r\nlofty, and painted with a fine red or yellow. The floor is of mosaic;\r\nand the door is made generally to serve as a window, there being but one\r\napartment which receives light through a thick blue glass. Many of these\r\nrooms are supposed to have been bed-chambers, because there is an\r\nelevated, broad step, on which the bed may have stood, and because some\r\nof the pictures appear most appropriate to a sleeping-room. Others are\r\nsupposed to have been dressing-rooms, from the fact that on the walls a\r\nVenus is described decorated by the Graces, added to which, little\r\nflasks and boxes of various descriptions have been found in them. The\r\nlarger of these apartments served for dining-rooms, and in some are\r\nsuitable accommodations for cold and hot baths.\r\n\r\nThe manner in which a whole room was heated, is particularly curious.\r\nAgainst the usual wall a second was erected, standing at a little\r\ndistance from the first. For this purpose large square tiles were taken,\r\nhaving, like modern tiles, a sort of hook, thus keeping the first wall\r\nas it were off from them: a hollow space was thus left all around, from\r\nthe top to the bottom, into which pipes were introduced, that carried\r\nthe warmth into the chamber, and as it were rendered the whole of the\r\nplace one stove. The ancients were also attentive to avoid the vapor or\r\nsmell from their lamps. In some houses there is a niche made in the wall\r\nfor the lamp, with a little chimney in the form of a funnel, through\r\nwhich the smoke escaped. Opposite to the house-door the largest room is\r\nplaced: it is properly a sort of hall, for it has only three walls,\r\nbeing quite open in the fore part. The side rooms have no connection\r\nwith each other, but are divided off in little cells, the door of each\r\nleading to a fountain.\r\n\r\nMost of the houses consist of one such square, surrounded by rooms. In a\r\nfew, some decayed steps seem to have led to an upper story, which is no\r\nlonger in existence. Some habitations, however, probably belonging to\r\nthe richer and more fashionable, are far more spacious. In these, a\r\nfirst court is often connected with a second, and even with a third, by\r\npassages: in other respects their arrangements are similar to those\r\nabove described. Many garlands of flowers and vine-branches, and many\r\nhandsome pictures, are still to be seen on the walls. The guides were\r\nformerly permitted to sprinkle these pictures with fresh water, in the\r\npresence of travelers, and thus revive their former splendor for a\r\nmoment: but this is now strictly forbidden; and, indeed, not without\r\nreason, since the frequent watering might at length totally rot away the\r\nwall.\r\n\r\nOne of the houses belonged to a statuary, whose workshop is still full\r\nof the vestiges of his art. Another appears to have been inhabited by a\r\nsurgeon, whose profession is equally evident from the instruments\r\ndiscovered in his chamber. A large country-house near the gate,\r\nundoubtedly belonged to a very wealthy man, and would, in fact, still\r\ninvite inhabitants within its walls. It is very extensive, stands\r\nagainst a hill, and has many stories. Its finely decorated rooms are\r\nunusually spacious; and it has airy terraces, from which you look down\r\ninto a pretty garden, that has been now again planted with flowers. In\r\nthe middle of this garden is a large fishpond, and near that an ascent\r\nfrom which, on two sides, six pillars descend. The hinder pillars are\r\nthe highest, the middle somewhat lower, and the front the lowest: they\r\nappear, therefore, rather to have propped a sloping roof, than to have\r\nbeen destined for an arbor. A covered passage, resting on pillars,\r\nincloses the garden on three sides; it was painted, and probably served\r\nin rainy weather as an agreeable walk. Beneath is a fine arched cellar,\r\nwhich receives air and light by several openings from without;\r\nconsequently its atmosphere is so pure, that in the hottest part of\r\nsummer it is always refreshing. A number of _amphoræ_, or large\r\nwine-vessels, are to be seen here, still leaning against the wall, as\r\nthe butler left them when he carried up the last goblet of wine for his\r\nmaster. Had the inhabitants of Pompeii preserved these vessels with\r\nstoppers, wine might still have been found in them; but as it was, the\r\nstream of ashes running in, of course forced out the wine. More than\r\ntwenty human skeletons of fugitives, who thought to save themselves here\r\nunder ground, but who must have experienced a tenfold more cruel death\r\nthan those suffered who were in the open air, were found in this cellar.\r\n\r\nThe destiny of the Pompeians must have been dreadful. It was not a\r\nstream of fire that encompassed their abodes: they could then have\r\nsought refuge in flight. Neither did an earthquake swallow them up;\r\nsudden suffocation would then have spared them the pangs of a lingering\r\ndeath. _But a rain of ashes buried them alive_ BY DEGREES! Hear the\r\ndelineation of Pliny: “A darkness suddenly overspread the country; not\r\nlike the darkness of a moonless night; but like that of a closed room,\r\nin which the light is of a sudden extinguished. Women screamed, children\r\nmoaned, men cried. Here, children were anxiously calling their parents;\r\nand there, parents were seeking their children, or husbands their wives;\r\nall recognized each other only by their cries. The former lamented their\r\nown fate, and the latter that of those dearest to them. Many wished for\r\ndeath, from the fear of dying. Many called on the gods for assistance:\r\nothers despaired of the existence of the gods, and thought this the last\r\neternal night of the world. Actual dangers were magnified by unreal\r\nterrors. The earth continued to shake, and men, half-distracted, to reel\r\nabout, exaggerating their own fears, and those of others, by terrifying\r\npredictions.”\r\n\r\nSuch is the frightful but true picture which Pliny gives us of the\r\nhorrors of those who were, however, far from the extremity of their\r\nmisery. But what must have been the feelings of the Pompeians, when the\r\nroaring of the mountain and the quaking of the earth, awaked them from\r\ntheir first sleep? They also attempted to escape the wrath of the gods;\r\nand, seizing the most valuable things they could lay their hands upon in\r\nthe darkness and confusion, endeavored to seek their safety in flight.\r\nIn this street, and in front of the house marked with the friendly\r\nsalutation on its threshold, seven skeletons were found: the first\r\ncarried a lamp, and the rest had still between the bones of their\r\nfingers something that they wished to save. On a sudden they were\r\novertaken by the storm which descended from heaven, and buried in the\r\ngrave thus made for them. Before the above mentioned country-house, was\r\nstill a male skeleton, standing with a dish in his hand; and, as he wore\r\non his finger one of those rings which were allowed to be worn by Roman\r\nknights only, he is supposed to have been the master of the house, who\r\nhad just opened the back garden gate with the intent of flying, when the\r\nshower overwhelmed him. Several skeletons were found in the very posture\r\nin which they had breathed their last, without having been forced by the\r\nagonies of death to drop the things they had in their hands. This leads\r\nto a conjecture, that the thick mass of ashes must have come down all at\r\nonce, in such immense quantities as instantly to cover them. It can not\r\notherwise be imagined how the fugitives could all have been fixed, as it\r\nwere by a charm, in their position; in which manner their destiny was\r\nthe less dreadful, seeing that Death suddenly converted them into\r\nmotionless statues, and thus was stripped of all the horrors with which\r\nthe fears of the sufferers had clothed him in imagination. But what then\r\nmust have been the pitiable condition of those who had taken refuge in\r\nthe buildings and cellars! Buried in the thickest darkness, they were\r\nsecluded from everything but lingering torment; and who can paint to\r\nhimself without shuddering, a slow dissolution approaching, amid all the\r\nagonies of body and of mind? The soul recoils from the contemplation of\r\nsuch images.\r\n\r\nTo proceed now to the public edifices. The temple of Isis is still\r\nstanding, with its Doric pillars, and its walls painted with emblems of\r\nthe service of the deity, such as the hippopotamus, cocoa-blossom, ibis,\r\n&c. A view of it is given in the cut. The sacred vessels, lamps and\r\ntables of Isis, are still to be seen. From a little chapel within, a\r\npoisonous vapor is said to have formerly arisen, which the heathen\r\npriests may have used for every species of deception. This vapor is said\r\nto have increased after the violent eruption of Vesuvius; but it has not\r\nlatterly given out the slightest smell. A small Grecian temple, of which\r\nonly two pillars remain, had been probably already destroyed by an\r\nearthquake, which, in the reign of Titus, preceded the dreadful\r\nirruption of the volcano. On the opposite side of this temple there is\r\nstill an edifice, called the quarters of the soldiers, because all sorts\r\nof arms, pictures of soldiers, and a skeleton in chains, were found\r\nthere. By others it has been considered as the forum of Pompeii.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TEMPLE OF ISIS AT POMPEII.]\r\n\r\nTwo theaters, the smaller one particularly, are in an excellent state of\r\npreservation. The structure of this one is such as was usually adopted\r\nby the ancients, and is better arranged than some of modern\r\nconstruction, as it affords the spectators commodious seats, a free view\r\nof the stage, and facility of hearing. Although sufficiently large to\r\ncontain two thousand persons, the plebeians, standing in a broad gallery\r\nat the top, were quite as able to see all that was passing on the stage,\r\nas the magistrate in his marble balcony. In this gallery the\r\narrangements for spreading the sail-cloth over the spectators are still\r\nvisible. The stage itself is very broad, as it has no side walls; and\r\nappears less deep than it really is. A wall runs across it, and cuts off\r\njust as much room as is necessary for the accommodation of the\r\nperformers. But this wall has three very broad doors; the middle one is\r\ndistinguished by its hight, and the space behind it is still deeper than\r\nin front. If these doors, as may be conjectured, always stood open, the\r\nstage was in fact large, and afforded besides the advantage of being\r\nable to display a double scenery: if, for example, the scene in front\r\nwas that of a street, there might have been behind a free prospect into\r\nthe open field.\r\n\r\nThe cemetery lies before the gate of the high road. The tomb of the\r\npriestess Mammea is very remarkable: it was erected, according to the\r\nepitaph, by virtue of a decree of the decemvirs. In the midst of little\r\nboxes of stone, in square piles, and on a sort of altar, the family urns\r\nwere placed in niches; and without these piles the broken masks are\r\nstill to be seen. In front of the cemetery, by the road-side, is a\r\nbeautiful seat, forming a semicircle, that will contain twenty or thirty\r\npersons. It was probably overshaded by trees eighteen hundred years ago;\r\nunder which the women of Pompeii sat in the cool evenings, while their\r\nchildren played before them, and viewed the crowds which were passing\r\nthrough the gate.\r\n\r\nTo the above particulars from the pen of the elegant and lively\r\nKotzebue, the following details, given by a later and accurate traveler,\r\nare subjoined. The entrance into Pompeii is by a quadrangular court; and\r\nthis court is surrounded on every side by a colonnade which supports the\r\nroof of a gallery; and the latter leads to several small apartments, not\r\nunlike the cells of a prison. The columns are of brick, stuccoed over,\r\nand painted of a deep red: they are in hight from ten to twelve feet,\r\nare placed at about a like distance from each other, and are of the\r\nDoric order, fluted two-thirds from the top, and well proportioned.\r\nAfter a variety of conjectures relative to the purpose to which this\r\nbuilding was applied, it has been ascertained that it was either a\r\nbarrack for soldiers, (various pieces of armor having been found in some\r\nof the cells,) or the prætorium of the governor, where a body of\r\nmilitary must have been stationed. Adjacent to it stood the theaters,\r\nthe forum, and one or two temples, all connected by very neat and\r\nwell-paved courts. The smaller of the theaters is to the right, and is\r\ncalled the covered theater, because it was so constructed, that by the\r\nmeans of canvas awnings, the spectators were defended from the sun and\r\nrain. A door through the wall leads to the different galleries, and to\r\nthe open space in the center, resembling the pit of a modern theater.\r\nThe interior is beautifully neat; and with the exception of the\r\nspoliation of the marble slabs, removed to the palace at Naples, with\r\nwhich the whole of the inside, not excepting the seats, had been\r\ncovered, it is in excellent preservation. On each side are the seats for\r\nthe magistrates; the orchestra, as in modern theaters, is in front of\r\nthe stage; and the latter, with its brick wings, is very shallow. This\r\ntheater was calculated to contain about two thousand spectators. From\r\nits level a staircase leads to an eminence on which several public\r\nbuildings are situated. The most conspicuous of these is a small temple\r\nsaid to have been dedicated to Isis, and having a secret passage,\r\nperforated in two places, whence the priests are supposed to have\r\ndelivered to the deluded multitude the oracles of that deity.\r\n\r\nWithin a paved court is an altar, of a round shape, on the one side, and\r\non the other side a well. A cistern, with four apertures, was placed at\r\na small distance, to facilitate the procuring of water. In this court,\r\nsacrifices and other holy rites are conjectured to have taken place,\r\nvarious utensils for sacrifice, such as lamps, tripods, &c., having been\r\nfound, when the place was first excavated. One of the tripods is of the\r\nmost admirable workmanship. On each of the three legs, a beautiful\r\nsphinx, with an unusual head-dress, is placed, probably in allusion to\r\nthe hidden meanings of the oracles which were delivered in the\r\nabove-mentioned temple. The hoop in which the basin for the coals was\r\nsunk, is elegantly decorated with rams’ heads connected by garlands of\r\nflowers; and within the basin, which is of baked earth, the very cinders\r\nleft from the last sacrifice (nearly two thousand years ago) are seen as\r\nfresh as if they had been the remains of yesterday’s fire!\r\n\r\nFrom the above court, you enter on a somewhat larger, with a stone\r\npulpit in the center and stone seats near the walls. The spot,\r\ntherefore, was either the auditory of a philosopher, or the place where\r\nthe public orators pleaded in the presence of the people. Everything\r\nhere is in the highest order and preservation.\r\n\r\nThe great amphitheater proudly rears its walls over every other edifice\r\non the same elevated spot. It is a stupendous structure, and has\r\ntwenty-four rows of seats, the circumference of the lowest of which is\r\nabout seven hundred and fifty feet. It is estimated to have contained\r\nabout thirty thousand spectators. The upper walls are much injured,\r\nhaving partially projected above ground long before the discovery of\r\nPompeii.\r\n\r\nA corn-field leads to the excavated upper end of the high street, which\r\nconsists of a narrow road for carts, with foot-pavements on each side.\r\nThe middle is paved with large blocks of marble, and the ruts of the\r\nwheels proclaim its antiquity, even at the time of its being\r\noverwhelmed. The foot-paths are elevated about a foot and a half from\r\nthe level of the carriage-road. The houses on each side, whether shops\r\nor private buildings, have no claim to external elegance: they consist\r\nof a ground-floor only, and, with the exception of the door, have no\r\nopening toward the street. The windows of the private houses look into\r\nan inner square court, and are in general very high. The apartments\r\nthemselves are, with the exception of one in each house, which probably\r\nserved as a drawing-room, both low and diminutive. In point of\r\ndecoration they are neat, and, in many instances, elegant: the floors\r\ngenerally consist of figured pavements, either in larger stones of\r\nvarious colors, regularly cut and systematically disposed, or are formed\r\nof a beautiful mosaic, with a fanciful border, and an animal or figure\r\nin the center. The geometrical lines and figures in the design of the\r\nborders, have an endless variety of the most pleasing shapes, to display\r\nthe fertile imagination of the artists. Their tesselated pavements alone\r\nmust convince us that the ancients were well skilled in geometry. The\r\nground is usually white, and the ornaments black; but other colors are\r\noften employed with increased effect.\r\n\r\nThe walls of the apartments are equally (if not still more) deserving\r\nattention. They are painted, either in compartments, exhibiting some\r\nmythological or historical event, or simply colored over with a light\r\nground, adorned with a border and perhaps an elegant little vignette, in\r\nthe center or at equal distances. But few of the historical paintings\r\nnow exist in Pompeii; for wherever a wall was found to contain a\r\ntolerable picture, it was removed and deposited in the museum at Naples.\r\nTo effect this, the greatest care and ingenuity were required, so as to\r\npeel off, by the means of sawing pieces of wall, twenty and more square\r\nfeet in extent, without destroying the picture. This, however, was not a\r\nmodern invention; for, among the excavated remains of Stabiæ, the\r\nworkmen came to an apartment containing paintings which had been\r\nseparated by the ancients themselves from a wall, with the obvious\r\nintent of their being introduced in another place. This was, however,\r\nprevented by the ruin of the city; and the paintings, therefore, were\r\nfound leaning against the wall of the apartment.\r\n\r\nAnother excavated portion of Pompeii is likewise part of a street, and,\r\nbeing perfectly in a line with the one already described, is conjectured\r\nto be a continuation, or rather the extremity of the latter; in which\r\ncase Pompeii must have been a city of considerable importance, and its\r\nmain street nearly a mile in length. The houses here, as in the other\r\ninstance, are distributed into shops and private dwellings, some of the\r\nlatter of which are distinguished by the remains of former internal\r\nelegance, such as tesselated pavements, painted walls, &c.: most of them\r\nhave likewise an interior court, surrounded by apartments.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         THE MUSEUM AT NAPLES.\r\n\r\nThe museum was formerly at Portici, but was removed to Naples some years\r\nago and is now called the Musæo Borbonico. The best statues, busts,\r\nvases, and in short, whatever was supposed, from its materials or\r\nconstruction, to have a superior value, were packed in fifty-two chests,\r\nand conveyed from Portici to Palermo, at the time the court sought\r\nrefuge in that city, on the French penetrating into the Neapolitan\r\nterritory. What still remains, however, in the museum, has a high\r\nintrinsic value; since no one can behold, without the strongest emotions\r\nof admiration, the relics of the most transitory things, which for\r\nnearly eighteen hundred years, have braved the ravages of time. Here are\r\nto be seen bread, corn, dough which was about to be placed in the oven,\r\nsoap which had been used for washing, figs, and even egg-shells\r\nperfectly white, and in as good a state as if the cook had broken them\r\nan hour before. Here a kitchen presents itself provided with everything\r\nrequisite: trivets and pots stand on the hearth; stew-pans hang on the\r\nwall; skimmers and tongs are placed in the corner; and a metal mortar\r\nrests on the shaft of a pillar. Weights, hammers, scythes, and other\r\nutensils of husbandry, are here blended with helms and arms. Sacrificing\r\nbowls and knives; a number of well shaped glasses; large and small glass\r\nbottles; lamps; vases; decorations for furniture; a piece of cloth;\r\nnets; and even shoe soles; all sorts of female ornaments—necklaces,\r\nrings and ear-rings; a wooden chess-board, reduced, indeed, to a cinder:\r\nall these things are more or less injured by the fire; but still are\r\ndistinguishable at first sight.\r\n\r\nEvery apartment of the museum is laid with the most charming antique\r\nfloors, which are partly mosaic, from Pompeii, and partly marble, from\r\nHerculaneum. Statues, vases, busts, chandeliers, altars, tables of\r\nmarble and bronze, are all in as good a state as if they had just come\r\nfrom the hands of the artist. The coins which have been collected are\r\nvery numerous, and fill several cases. Medallions of marble, containing\r\non each side a bas-relief, are suspended by fine chains from the ceiling\r\nof one of the apartments, and are within the reach of the hand, so as to\r\nbe conveniently turned and examined.\r\n\r\nMost of the pictures found at Herculaneum, Pompeii and Stabiæ, and now\r\ndeposited in the museum, have been sawed from the walls of the edifices\r\nthey adorned. These unique relics of ancient art form an extensive\r\ngallery of genuine antique pictures, the only one in the world, and may\r\non that account alone, be considered as an invaluable treasure. They are\r\nplaced in a range of apartments on the ground floor, and are suspended\r\nagainst the walls in plain frames. Their size varies from a foot square,\r\nto whole-length groups, nearly as large as life. Beside the injury they\r\nhave sustained by having been exposed to the heat of burning cinders,\r\nthey have been impaired by the modern varnish which was intended to\r\nprotect them: it would, therefore, not be right to subject their\r\ncoloring to the rigid rules of art; but the grouping of the Minotaur, of\r\nthe Telephus, of the sitting Orestes, and of the Bacchus and Ariadne, is\r\nadmirable. In their paintings, as well as in their sculptures, the\r\nancients were influenced by that love of simplicity which distinguishes\r\ntheir works from those of the moderns, and the result is, that in them\r\nthe chief merits of composition are combined, unity of subject, and\r\nunity of interest. When, again, it is considered that the paintings\r\ncollected in the museum at Naples were taken from the provincial towns,\r\nit must be inferred, that those which were admitted in the chief seats\r\nof art corresponded in excellence with the Laocoön and the Apollo. Such,\r\nat least, was the judgment of the ancients themselves, and their taste\r\nis not to be disputed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PAPYRI.]\r\n\r\nThe museum at Naples excels all others in ancient bronze, a substance\r\nwhich, although dearer, more difficult to be wrought, more inviting to\r\nthe rude grasp of avarice, and less beautiful than marble, forms the\r\ngreater proportion of the statues. The larger of them had been\r\noriginally composed of pieces connected by dove-tail joints; and these\r\npromiscuous fragments have been recompiled into new figures, as in the\r\ninstance of the single horse made from four, in the center of the\r\ncourt-yard of the museum. Those fragments which had escaped fusion, were\r\nrent, inflated, or bruised, by the burning lava. In addition to these\r\nmisfortunes, they have been made up unhappily; for the eye of an artist\r\ncan sometimes detect two styles of art, evidently different, the large\r\nand the exquisite, soldered together in the same statue. The figures the\r\nmost admired are, the drunken Faun, the sleeping Faun, the sitting\r\nMercury, the Amazon adjusting her robe, and an Augustus and a Claudius,\r\nboth of heroic size.\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable objects in the museum at Naples are the manuscripts,\r\nfound in two chambers of a house at Herculaneum. Although they have been\r\nso frequently described, they must be seen, to furnish a correct idea of\r\nthem. Before they are unrolled, they resemble sticks of charcoal, or\r\ncudgels reduced to the state of a cinder, and partly petrified. Their\r\ngeneral appearance before they are unrolled may be seen on the previous\r\npage. In color they are black and chesnut-brown: and they are\r\nunfortunately so decayed, that under each of them, as they lie in glass\r\ncases, a quantity of dust and detached fragments may be perceived. Their\r\ncharacters are legible in a certain light only, by a gloss and relief\r\nwhich distinguishes the ink, or rather black paint, from the tinder.\r\nCut, crushed, crumbled on the edge, and caked by the sap remaining in\r\nthe leaves of the papyrus, they require in the operator great sagacity\r\nto meet the variety of injuries they have received; since, in gluing\r\nrashly the more delicate parts, he might reach the heart of a volume,\r\nwhile working at the outside. At first, it appeared almost impracticable\r\never to decipher a syllable of them; but to the industry and talents of\r\nman nothing is impossible, and his curiosity impels him to the most\r\ningenious inventions.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              HERCULANEUM.\r\n\r\nThis city was, together with Pompeii and Stabiæ, involved in the common\r\nruin occasioned by the dreadful eruption of Vesuvius, in the reign of\r\nTitus, which has already been described in our previous pages.\r\n\r\nIt was situated on a point of land stretching into the gulf of Naples,\r\nabout two miles distant from that city, near where the modern towns of\r\nPortici and Resini, and the royal palace, by which they are separated,\r\nnow stand. The neck of land on which it was built, and which has since\r\ndisappeared, formed a small harbor. Hence the appellation of =Herculis\r\nPorticum=, (the small haven of Hercules,) sometimes given to\r\nHerculaneum, and thence in all probability, the modern name of Portici.\r\n\r\nThe latter being situated immediately above some of the excavations of\r\nHerculaneum, the just fear of endangering its safety, by undermining it,\r\nis given as a principal reason why so little progress has been made in\r\nthe Herculanean researches.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of Herculaneum is thus explained. At an inconsiderable\r\ndistance from the royal palace of Portici, and close to the seaside,\r\nPrince Elbeuf, in the beginning of the last century, inhabited an\r\nelegant villa. To obtain a supply of water a well was dug, in the year\r\n1730, through the deep crust of lava on which the mansion itself had\r\nbeen reared. The laborers, after having completely pierced through the\r\nlava, which was of considerable depth, came to a stratum of dry mud.\r\nThis event precisely agrees with the tradition relative to Herculaneum,\r\nthat it was in the first instance overwhelmed by a stratum of hot mud,\r\nwhich was immediately followed by a wide stream of lava. Whether this\r\nmud was thrown up from Vesuvius, or formed by torrents of rain, does not\r\nappear to have been decided. Within the stratum the workmen found three\r\nfemale statues, which were sent to Vienna.\r\n\r\nIt was not until some years after this, that the researches at\r\nHerculaneum were seriously and systematically pursued. By continuing\r\nElbeuf’s well, the excavators at once came to the theater, and from that\r\nspot carried on their further subterraneous investigation. The condition\r\nof Herculaneum was at that time much more interesting, and more worthy\r\nthe notice of the traveler, than it is at present. The object of its\r\nexcavation having unfortunately been confined to the discovery of\r\nstatues, paintings, and other curiosities, and not carried on with a\r\nview to lay open the city, and thus to ascertain the features of its\r\nbuildings and streets, most of the latter were again filled up with\r\nrubbish as soon as they were divested of everything movable. The marble\r\neven was torn from the walls of the temples. Herculaneum may therefore\r\nbe said to have been overwhelmed a second time by its modern\r\ndiscoverers; and the appearance it previously presented, can now only be\r\nascertained from the accounts of those who saw it in a more perfect\r\nstate. Agreeably to them, it must at that time have afforded a most\r\ninteresting spectacle.\r\n\r\nThe theater was one of the most perfect specimens of ancient\r\narchitecture. It had, from the floor upward, eighteen rows of seats, and\r\nabove these, three other rows, which, being covered with a portico, seem\r\nto have been intended for the female part of the audience, to screen\r\nthem from the rays of the sun. It was capable of containing between\r\nthree and four thousand persons. Nearly the whole of its surface, as\r\nwell as the arched walls which led to its seats, was cased with marble.\r\nThe area, or pit, was floored with thick squares of =giallo antico=, a\r\nbeautiful marble of a yellowish hue. On the top stood a group of four\r\nbronze horses, drawing a car, with a charioteer, all of exquisite\r\nworkmanship. The pedestal of white marble is still to be seen in its\r\nplace; but the group itself had been crushed and broken in pieces by the\r\nimmense weight of lava which fell on it. The fragments having been\r\ncollected, might easily have been brought together again, but having\r\nbeen carelessly thrown into a corner, a part of them were stolen, and\r\nanother portion fused, and converted into busts of their Neapolitan\r\nmajesties. At length, it was resolved to make the best use of what\r\nremained, that is, to convert the four horses into one, by taking a fore\r\nleg of one of them, a hinder leg of another, the head of a third, &c.,\r\nand, where the breach was irremediable, to cast a new piece. To this\r\ncontrivance the bronze horse now shown in the museum of Naples owes its\r\nexistence; and, considering its patchwork origin, it still conveys a\r\nhigh idea of the skill of the ancient artist.\r\n\r\nIn the forum, which was contiguous to the theater, beside a number of\r\ninscriptions, columns, &c., two beautiful equestrian statues of the\r\nBalbi family were found. These were of white marble, and were deposited\r\nin the hall of the left wing of the palace at Portici. Adjoining to the\r\nforum stood the temple of Hercules, an elegant rotunda, the interior of\r\nwhich was decorated with a variety of paintings, such as Theseus\r\nreturning from his Cretan adventure with the Minotaur, Telephus’s birth,\r\nChiron, the centaur, instructing Achilles, &c. These were carefully\r\nseparated from the walls, and are deposited in the museum at Naples.\r\n\r\nThe most important discovery, however, was that of a villa, at a small\r\ndistance from the forum; not only on account of the peculiarity of its\r\nplan, but because the greater number of the works of art were dug out of\r\nits precinct; and more especially because it contained a library\r\nconsisting of more than fifteen hundred volumes, which are likewise\r\nsafely deposited in the museum, and which, were they legible, would form\r\na great classic treasure. These have been mentioned in the account of\r\nthe museum at Naples, which will be found on a previous page. The villa\r\nis conjectured to have belonged to one of the Balbi family. Although\r\nelegant, it was small, and consisted of a ground-floor only, like those\r\nof Pompeii. Beside a number of small closets round an interior hall, it\r\ncontained a bathing-room, curiously fitted up with marble and\r\nwater-pipes, and a chapel of a diminutive size, without any window or\r\naperture for daylight, the walls of which were painted with serpents,\r\nand within which a bronze tripod, filled with cinders and ashes, was\r\nfound standing on the floor. The apartment which contained the library\r\nwas fitted up with wooden presses around the walls, about six feet in\r\nhight: a double row of presses stood insulated in the middle of the\r\nroom, so as to admit a free passage on every side. The wood of which the\r\npresses had been made, was burned to a cinder, and gave way at the first\r\ntouch; but the volumes, composed of a much more perishable substance,\r\nthe Egyptian or Syracusan papyrus, were, although completely carbonized\r\nthrough the effect of the heat, still so far preserved as to admit of\r\ntheir removal to a similar set of modern presses, (provided, however,\r\nwith glass doors,) in the museum.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of the garden belonging to this villa, was a large basin,\r\nhaving its edges faced with stone, and the two narrow ends rounded off\r\nin a semicircular form. This piece of water was surrounded by beds or\r\nparterres of various shapes; and the garden was on every side inclosed\r\nby a covered walk supported by columns. Of these columns there were\r\nsixty-four, ten for each of the shorter, and twenty-two for each of the\r\nlonger sides of the quadrangle: they were made of brick, neatly stuccoed\r\nover, exactly similar to those in the Pompeian barracks. Each pillar\r\nsupported one end of a wooden beam, the other extremity of which rested\r\non the garden wall, thus forming an arbor, in all probability planted\r\nwith vines around the whole garden. Under this covered walk, several\r\nsemicircular recesses, which appear to have served as bathing-places,\r\nwere built. The spaces between the pillars were decorated with marble\r\nbusts and bronze statues, alternately arranged. This garden was\r\nsurrounded by a narrow ditch; and another covered walk, of a\r\nconsiderable length, led to a circular balcony, or platform, the ascent\r\nto which was by four steps, but which overhung the sea about fifteen\r\nfeet. The floor of the balcony consisted of a very beautiful tesselated\r\npavement. From this charming spot the prospect over the whole bay of\r\nNaples, including the mountains of Sorrento, the island of Capri, and\r\nMount Posilipo, must have been delightful.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                POMPEII.\r\n\r\nHaving thus given the accounts of Kotzebue, and also of an English\r\ntourist, as to Pompeii and Herculaneum, we will now add the narrative of\r\nour distinguished fellow-citizen, Professor Silliman, who passed over\r\nthe same ground in 1851. All these views are given, because the subject\r\nis one of so much intrinsic interest, and because some objects are\r\nmentioned by each writer that are not by the others. Professor Silliman\r\nsays: “We passed rapidly along through Portici, Resina, and Torre del\r\nGreco,[6] which form one long-continued street, lying over Herculaneum,\r\na large city, whose entombed remains were far beneath our carriage\r\nwheels. Vesuvius was on our left, quiet and sublime. Clouds vailed its\r\ncrater from our view, but its venerable sides were enveloped in the\r\nblack drapery of its own lava floods. The currents have often flowed\r\nover the road on which we were traveling. Here and there, the lava had\r\nbeen cut through in the streets, and it protrudes in black, rocky\r\nmasses, upon which many of the houses have been erected. Lava formed the\r\nwalls of the houses, and the fences around the fields, and lava, only\r\nlava, was everywhere around us. After a short interval of cultivated\r\nfields, we arrived in Torre del Annunciata, in a street similar to those\r\nwe had passed, and surrounded by a country in the highest state of\r\ncultivation, where every foot of the rich volcanic soil is made\r\navailable. Farm-houses and villas appeared clustering around the eastern\r\nand southern foot of Vesuvius, and creeping up its sloping sides, so\r\nreckless are the people of past catastrophes, although Herculaneum\r\nreposes in its profound grave at the foot of the mountain, and the great\r\nsepulcher of Pompeii, with its funereal monuments, is in full view\r\nbefore them. They have also been very recently warned again, by the\r\nterrific eruption of February, 1850, which, bursting out back of\r\nVesuvius, on the east, took an unwonted direction, thus giving another\r\nproof that no situation on or near the mountain is safe; but still the\r\ninhabitants repose in careless security.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 6:\r\n\r\n  “Torre del Greco, a town containing eighteen thousand people, was\r\n  overwhelmed, in 1794, by an eruption of lava from Vesuvius, flowing\r\n  from the middle of its western slope, only five miles above the town.\r\n  The melted torrent buried the place, and inundated the sea,\r\n  encroaching upon it one-third of a square mile.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n“As we drove slowly onward, checking the horses from time to time, in\r\norder to realize the scenes around us, Antonio, from the coach-box,\r\nsuddenly exclaimed, ‘There is Pompeii!’ We eagerly looked, and saw a\r\nlow, green ridge of land, covered by grass and shrubs. It appeared as an\r\nextended mound, over which the traveler might have driven, as thousands\r\nhave heedlessly done in centuries past, unconscious that a city of the\r\ndead slumbered beneath the hoofs of the horses. Only a few minutes\r\nelapsed, before standing erect in the carriage, we discerned the still\r\nnaked heaps of pumice that have been thrown out during the excavations;\r\nand immediately after, in breathless silence, we were at the door of the\r\nhouse of Diomede! An elegant country-house, a Roman villa, just outside\r\nof the walls of the city, still stands, almost eighteen hundred years\r\nafter the great catastrophe. Its columns are erect, its walls entire,\r\nand its open doors seem to invite the stranger to enter; but the family\r\nare not there, and silence reigns in the halls of Diomede!\r\n\r\n“I never before felt as I did when I entered this deserted\r\nhouse—pensive, solemn, and in full sympathy with the tragical story.\r\nSentinels still keep these doors; not the helmeted Roman, who, firm and\r\nunmoved, surveyed the storm of fire but yielded not to fear, preferring\r\nto die at his post,[7] but Neapolitans stationed there by the government\r\nto prevent invasion of the ruins. One there was, a veteran, whose snowy\r\nhair, and visage so deeply marked by time, made us almost feel as if he\r\nmust have been present when the volcanic tempest raged, and had,\r\nSalathiel-like, come down to our time to relate the events of those\r\ndreadful days. But a garrulous guide, who spoke tolerable English,\r\nplaced himself at the head of our party, and was our =cicerone= through\r\nan intensely interesting day. We mused for a few minutes in the vacant\r\nrooms of the house of Diomede, walked upon the still beautiful mosaic\r\npavements and floors, passed through the dormitories, the triclinium,\r\nthe impluvium, and the hall for conversation; observed the\r\nwater-cistern, and the channels worn in the stone curb by the friction\r\nof the rope, and then descended to the vaults beneath, in which so many\r\nmembers of the family met their fate. This gallery is strongly arched\r\nwith brick, and was used as a wine-cellar, as appears from twenty-five\r\namphoræ still remaining there, and which were found filled with volcanic\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 7:\r\n\r\n  “In the Pompeian museum at Naples, we afterward saw the skull of such\r\n  a Roman, whose head was still covered by his helmet, and whose\r\n  skeleton was found at his station in the gate of Pompeii.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n“On the twenty-fourth of August, in the year 79 of our own era, and not\r\nlong after midday, Vesuvius broke the repose of untold ages, and\r\nresumed, with tragical energy, his ancient reign of fire, awakening the\r\nslumbering echoes of his power with terrible detonations and fearful\r\nearthquakes. A darkness that might be felt, shrouded in the profoundest\r\ngloom the midday sun, and ashes fell like snow upon the mountain, the\r\nplain, the bays of Naples and Baiæ, and far into the surrounding\r\ncountry. Rain from the condensed steam of the eruption deluged the whole\r\ndistrict; torrents of fluid mud, formed by the ashes and water, swept\r\nover every obstruction, and filled to overflowing every depression of\r\nthe surface. The terrified inhabitants, overwhelmed by superstitious\r\nfears, joined the droves of domestic animals, whose keener instincts had\r\nalready impelled them to desert a district filled with sulphureous\r\nvapors, and vibrating with ominous and unwonted sounds, wandering, they\r\nknew not where, in search of some place where the frightful evidences of\r\nthe wrath of the gods might be avoided.\r\n\r\n“But the family of Diomede sought refuge from the falling pumice under\r\nthe strong arch of the wine-cellar, strong enough to resist and sustain\r\nthe load of falling materials, but not proof against the deluge of\r\nvolcanic mud, whose unexpected inundation brought death to the mistress,\r\nher children, and fifteen female slaves. The record of the manner of\r\ntheir death is even now perfectly legible. The form of the mistress,\r\nwith her back and head to the wall, with outstretched arms, is clearly\r\ndelineated by the difference of color. Surrounding her are the\r\nimpressions of the persons of seventeen others, various in stature, but\r\nall standing, save one infant in the arms. When these silent vaults were\r\nexcavated, here stood the skeletons of these unfortunate people, the\r\nrich jewels of the mistress and of her daughter circling the bony\r\nfingers and wrists and neck. These we afterward saw in the museum at\r\nNaples, the left shoulder of the mother, as also the skull of the\r\ndaughter, whose name, _Julia_, was engraved upon her bracelet. Equally\r\nstrange and wonderful was it to see the cast of the bosom of this Roman\r\nmatron, taken with lifelike precision, in the soft and fluid tufa. Her\r\nhand still grasped the purse, whose contents are also among the\r\nwonderful treasures of the same museum. Beyond the garden and the\r\nfish-pond, which are contiguous to the wine-cellar, there is a gateway\r\nwhere were found two skeletons, with valuable vessels and money; one\r\nhand held a rusted key, and the other a bag with coin and cameos, and\r\nvessels of silver and bronze were here. These are believed to have been\r\nthe remains of the master Diomede and his servant. A wrapper contained\r\neighty pieces of silver money, ten of gold, and some bronze. It appears\r\nhighly probable that, having left the family in a place which was\r\nbelieved to be safe, they were engaged in transporting valuables to a\r\nplace of deposit, when they were overtaken by the same deluge which\r\ndestroyed their friends.\r\n\r\n“The water-line to which the fluid magma rose in this quadrangular\r\nvaulted gallery, is still visible upon the walls, (some twelve to\r\nfifteen inches above the tallest head,) nearly even with several small\r\napertures through which, as well as through the door, it probably\r\nflowed. It is not unlikely that this inundation was accompanied by\r\ntorrents of carbonic acid and other noxious gases, so abundantly exhaled\r\nin more modern eruptions of Vesuvius, by which these refugees from the\r\ndangers above ground were perhaps so suddenly suffocated as to remain\r\nunmoved in the positions where they were found. The sudden death of the\r\nelder Pliny, who, his nephew says, was suffocated by a noxious\r\nexhalation upon the same occasion, and at no great distance from\r\nPompeii, may, with much probability, be ascribed to the same cause.\r\n\r\n“The facts now detailed clearly show that vast torrents of mud must have\r\npassed through the streets of Pompeii, since dry ashes and ejections of\r\nlapilli and pumice, unaided by water, could never have found their way\r\ninto the interior of closed amphoræ, nor made perfect molds of the human\r\nform, nor left a level water-line upon the inner walls of close arched\r\npassages. The shower of materials which buried the city, was mainly\r\ncomposed of small pieces of white pumice and rounded lapilli of various\r\ncolors, interspersed with some large projected masses of rock-bombs,\r\nsuch as Vesuvius has often thrown out in later times. These by their\r\nfall broke through the roofs, and at the places where they struck,\r\ndepressed the mosaic pavements into a concave form, as we saw in several\r\nof the houses. A darker colored sand appears to have alternated with the\r\npumice, and often forms a distinct and thick layer upon it. Numerous\r\nsuch alternations have been made out by the Neapolitan geologists, and\r\nwe afterward saw the same order of stratification distinctly in another\r\npart of the town, where fresh excavations were going on. The fresh\r\nsection here showed, that these loose materials fell much as snow falls\r\nin our northern climates when driven by the wind, being thicker in the\r\nangles than in the centers of the houses, and rising in curves\r\ncorresponding to the elevations and depressions of the surface.\r\n\r\n“The celebrated Appian way passed by the house of Diomede, and through\r\nPompeii to Stabiæ. The road is now above ground, and is evidently as\r\nperfect as when Pompeii was buried. It is paved with large blocks of the\r\nancient lava of Mount Somma, which, of course, proves the occurrence of\r\nearly eruptions of the volcano, although at an unknown era. Deep ruts\r\nare worn by the wheels in the solid lava, which is as firm as trap,\r\nwhile the stones are strongly marked by the rust of the iron worn off\r\nfrom the wheel-tires. The furrows prove that the wheels were not more\r\nthan four feet apart. This is proved also by the position of the\r\nstepping-stones for crossing the streets, which were so placed that the\r\nwheels passed between them. The stepping-stones were very large, and two\r\nand a half or three feet long, their longest diameter coinciding with\r\nthe direction of the street; and they were laid so near to each other\r\nthat the passengers could pass quite across the street from one\r\nside-walk to the opposite, without stepping down. There were side-walks\r\nin the principal streets, about three feet wide, and two feet above the\r\npavement. The streets were paved with the same hard lava rock, and in\r\nmany places it was worn into deep hollows by human feet, thus proving\r\nthe high antiquity of the city. The street near the barracks is only\r\nthirteen feet wide. We passed through one street in which the pavement\r\nwas in very bad order; the ruts were worn irregularly and very deep, the\r\nstones were tilted out of the proper level, and there, as sometimes\r\nhappens in modern cities, the street commissioners had evidently not\r\ndone their duty.\r\n\r\n“The Appian way, near to Pompeii, but outside of the walls and\r\nimmediately contiguous to them, is, as at Rome, bordered on both sides\r\nby _tombs_. and in general they are in good condition, having been\r\npreserved during seventeen centuries equally from injuries by the\r\nweather and by wanton violation. They are of marble, and their Latin\r\ninscriptions still commemorate their tenants. One tomb, constructed in\r\nthe manner of the columbaria, is dedicated to the gladiators, and is\r\ndecorated with bas-reliefs representing their combats. Near the tombs,\r\nand outside of the walls, we saw sheds for the horses of those who\r\narrived after the gates of the city were closed. No stables have been\r\ndiscovered in the town, but skeletons of horses were found at this\r\nplace, where there was a large tavern.\r\n\r\n“Pompeii was first discovered in 1748. It lies about twelve miles\r\nsouth-east from Naples. The town was extremely compact, and appears to\r\nhave been only three-fourths of a mile long by half a mile wide. The\r\nhouses were joined together. Twenty streets, which are only fifteen feet\r\nwide, had been uncovered twenty years since. Although only one-third\r\npart of the city has been cleared of its covering, five or six hours\r\nwere industriously employed by us, with our two guides, in visiting the\r\nmost interesting private dwellings and the public buildings. We were\r\nindeed richly rewarded for our effort. Here we were, walking in the very\r\nstreets and on the very pavements on which the ancient Romans trod; we\r\nwere surveying the very houses in which they dwelt: we saw the\r\nvestibules, the impluvium (an interior and central receptacle for the\r\nrain-water from the roofs;) their triclinia, or dining-halls; their\r\ncolonnades, surrounding an interior open area, in which they walked and\r\nconversed with their families and friends; the fish-ponds, also in an\r\nopen area; the private marble baths; the kitchens and other arrangements\r\nfor culinary purposes; the gardens in the rear of the houses, the halls\r\nand colonnades opening into the garden; the whole forming a domestic\r\ndominion secure from public inspection. All these arrangements were\r\nperfectly intelligible to us; and as we walked from house to house, it\r\nwas not difficult to imagine that we were making calls, and that the\r\npeople were not at home.\r\n\r\n“Everywhere, even in the smaller houses, the floors were adorned with\r\nmosaic; many of the best designs have been sent to Naples, but,\r\nincluding what is still covered, much more remains in place, and not\r\nessentially injured. When it is considered that no melted lava flowed\r\ninto Pompeii, but that it was covered solely by a volcanic shower of\r\ncomminuted pumice and other pulverulent materials, which accumulated\r\nuntil the roofs were crushed inward by the weight, it will be easily\r\nunderstood that the mosaic floors may have remained for seventeen or\r\neighteen hundred years, substantially uninjured. The mosaic of Pompeii\r\nis uncovered in many places, and when the dust is brushed away and the\r\nsurface is wiped with a wet cloth, as was done for our gratification,\r\nall the original brightness and beauty of the figures shine forth, and\r\nin the finest patterns, the execution was in a high degree tasteful and\r\nelegant. At the door of the mansion of the edile Glaucus, which was one\r\nof the largest and best in the city, there was, in the vestibule and\r\nbefore entering the house, a very startling mosaic figure of a large and\r\npowerful dog, secured by a chain around his neck, but crouching and\r\nfierce, as if about to spring upon the visitor; and immediately before\r\nthis vigilant sentinel, you read in large Roman letters, CAVE\r\nCANEM—beware of the dog! The inscription is preserved in the original\r\nplace where we saw it, but the dog has been removed to the museum at\r\nNaples. It is still a perfect figure of a Roman dog.\r\n\r\n“The frescoes of Pompeii and Herculaneum, have put us in possession of\r\nvery perfect specimens of the skill of the Romans in the art of\r\npainting. The only examples of their pictorial talent previously known,\r\nwere the comparatively imperfect decorations in the baths of Titus at\r\nRome. In these buried cities nearly all the walls of the houses are\r\nfrescoed, and among these, have been found many superb specimens of\r\nancient art. Most of the best have been removed to the museum of Naples,\r\nbut some of considerable merit still remain in place, and no doubt\r\nfurther excavations will show numerous others now unknown. The colors\r\nare somewhat faded, but are bright when wet. The copies in water-colors,\r\nsold at Naples, give very perfectly the idea of these frescoes, but with\r\nmore brilliancy than is possessed by the original. Many of these figures\r\nare nude, although many are draped. We were particularly struck with the\r\nsingularity of some of the figures on the walls, having _shoes_ very\r\nmuch like our modern ones. As the great object of art is to present\r\nNature in her forms of greatest purity and grace, these nude figures can\r\nnot meet with more objections than their modern representatives. We saw\r\nnothing in Pompeii or Herculaneum, worthy of so much criticism in point\r\nof taste, as may be seen in almost any of the European galleries of\r\nmodern painting. Titian’s Loves of the Gods in Blenheim palace,\r\ncertainly surpass the ancients in this respect.\r\n\r\n“An expected visit of the Duke d’Aumale (son of Louis Philippe, and\r\nallied by marriage to the royal family of Naples) has been made the\r\noccasion of _an additional excavation_, which is now being carried on by\r\norder of the king. We thought it rare good fortune, that we could stand\r\nby and see the moving of materials which had not been disturbed since\r\nthe catastrophe. They are entirely unconsolidated, and are easily moved\r\nby the shovel. The accumulations did not appear to be more than ten feet\r\nabove the tops of the houses, but if measured from the level of the\r\nstreets, they might have been twenty feet in thickness. In it were\r\ndistinctly visible the alternation of fine pumice, coarse pumice,\r\nlapilli and dark colored sand, before mentioned.\r\n\r\n“We had the pleasure of seeing apartments that had been recently opened,\r\nand of going into several of them. In these, the pictures are fresh, and\r\nfar less faded than in those that have been long exposed. In one of\r\nthese houses, all the marble figures found around the impluvium, and\r\ncolonnade, and fountain, have been allowed to remain intact, as the\r\nRomans left them, when they fled for their lives. Around the fountain in\r\none of these houses, there were numerous grotesque jets formed of\r\nmarble, in the shape of miniature bulls, ducks and dolphins, and\r\nassociated with them was a Bacchus. A leaden tube which formerly\r\nconveyed water for the fountain, remains in place as it passed through\r\nthe wall. We observed, as illustrating the condition of the art of\r\nworking this metal among the Romans, that the pipe was not drawn nor\r\ncast, but was made by folding up a sheet into the tubular form, and\r\nclosing the joint by a lap without solder. In this house was a large\r\nvaulted music room, the walls of which are nearly perfect. The object\r\nfor which the room was constructed, was sufficiently indicated by\r\nfigures of musical instruments, and of persons playing upon them.\r\nColumns were in general use in the better houses, around the included\r\narea, in the gardens, and in other places. In the best dwellings they\r\nare of polished marble, in many they are stuccoed. Some of the Roman\r\nhouses, in their most perfect and uninjured condition, must have been\r\nvery beautiful, although their accommodations were much more limited\r\nthan those of modern times. The rooms, the dormitories especially, were\r\nmuch smaller, and the houses were low, and rarely rose above two\r\nstories. They were so constructed as to admit of the most perfect\r\ndomestic seclusion: no eye could scrutinize the family privacy from the\r\nstreet, or from another house. Various names have been given to several\r\nof the larger and more beautiful houses in Pompeii, sometimes fanciful,\r\nbut more frequently from some statue, mosaic, painting, or other\r\ndistinctive work of art found in them, referring, as is sometimes\r\nsupposed, to the owner. Thus we saw the houses of the Faun, of the\r\nMedusa, of the three Fountains, and those of Pansa, of Glaucus, of\r\nSallust, and of Cicero. It is doubtful whether Cicero had a house at\r\nPompeii, and still more doubtful whether the one called by his name had\r\nany connection with him. The three fountains in the house of that name,\r\nare decorated with modern sea-shells, such as now abound in the\r\nMediterranean, and in a style of patterns still prevalent in Naples. The\r\nfountains in the two houses newly exposed were very elegant, and in\r\nperfect condition.\r\n\r\n“The forum was large and handsome, and surrounded with double rows of\r\ncolumns for a covered colonnade. In connection with it, was a temple of\r\nJupiter, and another opposite to it, of Venus, both decorated with\r\nmassive monolithic columns. Half-dressed blocks of marble and portions\r\nof columns lie on the ground in the forum, where they were in process of\r\npreparation, to repair the injuries done to the building by the shocks\r\nof an earthquake, before the destructive eruption. Numerous dislocated\r\nand propped walls in the city bear testimony to the same event, which\r\noccurred in the year 63. Connected with the forum, was the basilica or\r\nhall of justice, a structure adorned with columns, and provided with an\r\nelevated tribune for the judges. Vaulted apartments beneath, were used\r\nas a prison, communicating by a circular opening in the crown of the\r\narch, with the hall above. In this prison, which we entered, were found\r\nthree skeletons of prisoners, ironed to the floor, doubtless waiting\r\ntheir examination at the time of the catastrophe, which so unexpectedly\r\nchanged the venue of their trial to another bar! Many acres are inclosed\r\nby the various structures of the forum, whose very ruins, with their\r\nnumerous columns, make a grand appearance. Among the ruins, are those of\r\na temple to Esculapius, one for Hercules, and another for Fortune.\r\n\r\n“Numerous monuments and inscriptions in Pompeii, indicate the Greek\r\norigin of the original colony, and the Egyptian customs and society\r\nwhich preceded the Roman dynasty. The temple of Isis still shows its\r\nsacrificial altar, and inscriptions in Egyptian characters cover the\r\ncolumns. Some of the largest and most beautiful of the silver vessels in\r\nthe museum at Naples, were found in this temple. Curiously enough, as we\r\nentered these ancient precincts, in which the serpent was held sacred, a\r\nsnake, reputed by the guide as venomous, crossing our path, was made a\r\nvictim, which we offered on the altar.\r\n\r\n“Beneath a superb portico in the street of the tombs, the skeletons of a\r\nfemale and several children were discovered; in the street near the\r\ntemple of Isis, another skeleton was found at the depth of ten feet, and\r\nbelow it, a large collection of gold and silver medals in perfect\r\npreservation, chiefly of the reign of Domitian.\r\n\r\n“The theaters, whose remains are distinct, are the comic, the tragic,\r\nand the amphitheater. They were lined with polished marble, and were, in\r\nevery way, highly finished and elegant. Of the two former, the entire\r\nplan and the greater part of the structure are visible, and most of the\r\nseats are in place.\r\n\r\n“The amphitheater was in a remote part of the city, near the eastern\r\nwall. It has undergone so little dilapidation, that it appears almost\r\nperfect. We approached it by ascending the ground until we were quite at\r\nthe top, and we then descended by the stone seats, quite to the arena,\r\nwhich, by pacing, we found to be two hundred and forty feet by one\r\nhundred and twenty. From the arena we looked up over the entire circuit\r\nand elevation of the seats, which are almost perfectly preserved—thanks\r\nto the sepulture of seventeen hundred years. Had this amphitheater been\r\nin the midst of Naples, as the Coliseum was at Rome, it would, no doubt,\r\nhave fared as ill at the hands of the architects. It was easy for us now\r\nto people it in imagination, with the thousands of Romans who have so\r\noften gazed and applauded from these seats, while blood, both brute and\r\nhuman, was flowing in the arena where we were standing. Such may have\r\nbeen the scenes when the tempest of fire broke forth, for the people of\r\nPompeii are said to have been then engaged in the amphitheater.\r\n\r\n“There are two buildings for _public baths_, which are well preserved;\r\nthe bronze seats and braziers still remain in them. For men, there was a\r\ncommon bath, circular and large enough for entire immersion; it is of\r\nmarble, and is now in good condition. The dome, or ceiling, has in part\r\nfallen in, but the portion over the bath is preserved. We measured the\r\nroom and found it to be sixty feet by twenty. There was another bath for\r\nwomen, contiguous to this, but at a proper distance. This marble bath is\r\nquite perfect, and the room being entirely arched has been preserved\r\nuninjured. It is most interesting. There is a living fountain at one\r\nend, and there was an arrangement, whose object is even now quite\r\napparent, for warming the room by hot air or steam. Here, in this\r\nancient ladies’ bath, we dined upon our stores brought out from Naples.\r\nIntruding upon this retreat, once so sacred, we seated ourselves quite\r\nconveniently, on the side of the bath, in a fine frescoed room of sixty\r\nfeet by sixteen. This was the most perfect building that we saw in\r\nPompeii. In this vicinity, there is a _living fountain_ still abundant,\r\nand the river Sarno runs at this moment beneath Pompeii. Through a wide\r\nopening we saw its copious and lively stream still flowing in its\r\nancient channel, apparently undisturbed by volcanic and earthquake\r\nconvulsions.\r\n\r\n“The walls of Pompeii are still in good condition; they were three miles\r\nin circuit, from eighteen to twenty feet high, and twenty feet thick.\r\nSeven gates have been discovered; the gate of Herculaneum, of Vesuvius,\r\nof Capua, of Nola, of Sarno, of Stabiæ, and of the theaters. The sites\r\nof nine towers have been ascertained. We ascended the wall by stairs of\r\nstone, doubtless coeval with the wall itself: the view was imposing.\r\nVesuvius rose above the desolated city, looking down upon its naked\r\nwalls and roofless houses. The volcanic mound still covers two-thirds of\r\nthe city, and nothing on its upper surface tells of what lies below. It\r\nwere greatly to be desired, that an enlightened and energetic\r\ngovernment, with adequate means, would uncover the entire city, with its\r\nnumerous hidden works of art and materials of history.\r\n\r\n“The baker’s shop, with his oven of arched and modern form, the tub of\r\nstone in which he wet his broom, and the hourglass-shaped mills of hard\r\nlava for grinding the grain, we saw all perfect. There were mills of two\r\nsizes: one small, such as could be turned by hand, as when ‘two women\r\nwere grinding at the mill,’ and one much larger, and provided with\r\nsquare holes to receive the ends of levers, requiring, of course, much\r\nmore force to turn them, and doubtless worked by men. The shops of the\r\nwine and oil merchants were provided with large _amphoræ_ set in masonry\r\nunder the counter, for storing those fluids, and numerous other\r\narrangements for the convenience of the occupants were visible.\r\n\r\n“In one house we saw a small circular window, in which part of the glass\r\nplate which originally filled it still remains. One other similar glass\r\nis said to have been found, although shutters were in general use for\r\nmost of the windows. As there were no windows, as with us, opening upon\r\nthe street, and all the doors and windows of the house opened upon\r\nprivate courts and gardens, there was in this mild and equable climate\r\nfar less occasion for the use of glass than might seem at first\r\nrequisite. That they understood the manufacture of glass, and how to\r\ncolor it, by the use of the oxyds of cobalt and copper, is abundantly\r\nproved by the remains of this ancient art now in the Borbonico museum,\r\nat Naples.\r\n\r\n“One peculiarity in the construction of the Pompeian houses favors the\r\nremoval and preservation of the frescoes. The walls upon which the\r\npictures are painted are not solid, but the frescoed surface is\r\nsupported by studs of masonry or iron, at a distance of some four or\r\nfive inches in front of the brick walls. Security from dampness is thus\r\nobtained, and the task of removing the valued surface much simplified\r\nand facilitated. The declining sun found us still lingering on the seats\r\nof the amphitheater, at the remotest angle of the city wall, dwelling\r\nwith delight upon these memorials of the past, and speculating upon the\r\nprobability of renewed activity in Vesuvius, whose quiet blue cone rose\r\nover our right shoulders crowned with a soft cloud of vapor. It was late\r\nin the evening of this most interesting day when we reached the door of\r\nour hotel, long after darkness had hidden the landscape.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              THE MUSEUM.\r\n\r\n“The Musæo Borbonico (as it is now called) contains all the most choice\r\nand valued works of art and objects of interest which the excavations at\r\nHerculaneum and Pompeii have brought to light. To this we repaired on\r\nthe day following our visit to Pompeii, to follow up our researches into\r\nthe details of these most interesting discoveries. Here we saw the\r\ngolden ornaments found upon the skeletons in the house of Diomede, as\r\nbefore mentioned, and many others also. One pair of bracelets weighed a\r\npound each. As for the workmanship, all that was said of the Etruscan\r\ngolden ornaments is substantially true of the Pompeian. The ladies of\r\nthese cities were certainly well provided with costly jewelry, both of\r\npure gold and of the same metal set with precious stones. There was one\r\nribbon of wrought gold. Ring stones and brooches without number are\r\npreserved here, and among the cameos in agate, are the largest as well\r\nas the smallest and most exquisite of these elaborate works of art ever\r\nfound. Many of the latter can be appreciated only when examined under a\r\nstrong magnifier.\r\n\r\n“Utensils in earthen ware are abundant, but porcelain seems to have been\r\nunknown to the Romans. Blown and molded glass of various forms and\r\ncolors, and designed for various uses, is also common. Pickle jars and\r\nolive jars, still retaining their preserved fruits in good condition,\r\nwere found, and others contained cosmetics or colors. One elegant vase,\r\nof the color of =lapis lazuli=, has figures in white enamel cut on its\r\nsides, reminding us of the celebrated Portland vase. The Romans seldom\r\nemployed iron for culinary purposes, but almost every vessel of this\r\ndescription was fashioned from bronze. A very extensive collection is\r\nfound in this museum, reproducing nearly all our modern metallic vessels\r\nboth of utility and ornament. They are generally elegant in form, and\r\nare often ornamented with artistic designs, especially in the attachment\r\nof the spouts, handles, feet or other prominent parts. They are\r\ngenerally also in a remarkable state of preservation, being for the most\r\npart merely covered by a thin coating of greenish rust, easily removed.\r\nSometimes, however, they are corroded through and through with holes.\r\nAmong the bronze vessels in the collection is one showing that the\r\nRomans were well acquainted with the modern device of a heater to keep\r\nliquids hot in a large vessel. It is quite on the model of the coffee\r\nurn of our day. They also employed, as is evident, steam and hot water\r\nto keep dishes hot; for there is a very pretty affair in bronze, like a\r\nshallow pan, to hold water, set on legs, with a fire beneath, and\r\nprovided with valves for the escape of steam.\r\n\r\n“Among the objects most frequently found in Pompeii are fishing-nets and\r\ntackle, showing the habits of the people in this particular to be\r\nsimilar to those of the modern towns of the same coast, although now\r\nPompeii is a mile from the sea. The iron rings in the walls for\r\nfastening vessels were also found, and prove still more conclusively the\r\naccumulations in seventeen hundred years. Two vases were discovered in\r\nPompeii full of water; in one it was tasteless and limpid, and in the\r\nother brown and alkaline. Among the things preserved in the buried\r\ncities were walnuts, chestnuts, almonds, dates, dried figs, prunes,\r\ncorn, oil, peas, lentils, pies and hams. Papyri were found in large\r\nnumbers, but the rolls were blackened, as were the timber and the corn,\r\nas vegetables are by inhumation in coal beds. Beside the pickles, and\r\nolives, and roe of fish, already mentioned, we saw in a glass globe, in\r\nthis part of the museum, wheat, and barley also, blackened by age and\r\ndampness. The loaves of bread, bearing the baker’s stamp, which were\r\nfound in the shop already named, are singularly perfect, showing\r\ndistinctly the lines of quartering in which the loaf was designed to be\r\ncut.\r\n\r\n“The works of art found in Herculaneum are in general much better than\r\nthose from Pompeii, and every external sign proves it to have been a\r\ntown of more refinement and wealth than its neighbor. Numerous statues\r\nin bronze and marble have been collected from these cities, and a large\r\nhall in the museum is devoted to their exhibition. Many are\r\nmythological, but busts and statues of the several emperors are also\r\ncommon. One bronze horse, considerably injured and corroded, has been\r\nfound, and an admirable bronze Hercules. The candelabra were numerous\r\nand elegant. One we observed fitted to take apart for the convenience of\r\ntraveling; its sliding rod drops into a case or sheath, and the tripod\r\nfoot folds together as snugly as the wing of a bird. A very beautiful\r\ncandelabrum, taken from the house of Diomede, has a basis formed of a\r\nsmall flat table of bronze standing upon feet. It is elegantly inlaid\r\nwith silver in the form of a running vine and of leaves; some portions\r\nhave been burnished, to give an idea of its original beauty. A\r\nperpendicular rod rises three feet in hight, and supports a cross upon\r\nwhich are suspended four lamps. All the parts are preserved; and were\r\nthis tasteful candelabrum put in order and burnished, it would be a fine\r\nform for our modern artists to copy, who, indeed, often profit by\r\nancient models.\r\n\r\n“The Roman steelyards had a scale suspended so as to receive the thing\r\nto be weighed, and the weight slid, as with us, upon a graduated beam;\r\nin one the counterpoise is fashioned into an elegant female head. There\r\nis a collection of surgical instruments, some of them very similar to\r\nthose used at the present day. Iron probes, iron teeth extractors,\r\nelevators for the operation of trepanning, a cauterizing iron, lancets,\r\ncatheters, amputating instruments, spatulas and obstetric forceps. Along\r\nwith these things are rolls of the apothecary, ready to be divided into\r\n_pills_. The articles of the _toilet_ are abundant; pins of ivory in\r\nlarge numbers and great variety for the hair; combs, curling-tongs,\r\nboxes for perfumes and rouge, which is preserved in a small glass\r\nbottle; mirrors of metal, small, but sufficient for a lady’s face, and\r\nreflectors, to be used probably in a position to give seasonable notice\r\nof the approach of a visitor from the vestibule, similar to the\r\narrangement now common in Holland and Germany. Numerous small objects\r\nattracted our attention, among which were the ivory dice, and tickets of\r\nbone or ivory for admission to the theater, marked and numbered. Musical\r\ninstruments were common; among them numerous flutes or flageolets,\r\nprepared from bone. Numerous bronze penates, truly =dii minores=, often\r\nless than a finger’s length in hight, some partly finished, are to be\r\nseen in the museum at Naples.\r\n\r\n“There is an apartment here, finished in the style of an ancient Roman\r\nhouse. This is in the extreme end of one of the long suites of rooms.\r\nThe sky-blue panels have each, in the center, a female figure, volant or\r\nquiet; the upper part of the side walls, and of the dome, is divided\r\ninto compartments, which are decorated by colored lines and forms of\r\ngreat beauty, the entire effect of which is charming. The eye delights\r\nto dwell upon them, and would never be tired, because the beauty,\r\nalthough exquisite, is simple and tasteful. We saw in the museum, as\r\nalready mentioned, the helmet and skull of the Roman sentinel found at\r\nhis post in the city gate at Pompeii, with his short sword by his side;\r\nthere, too, was the complete armor of a Roman knight with a decorated\r\nand crested helmet, with figures embossed upon the breast-plate, and the\r\ncoverings of the arms and limbs. We must not forget the iron stocks for\r\npunishment. A bar of iron or bronze of great weight had metallic\r\nprojections standing upward, between which the feet were placed, and\r\nsecured by a cross pin. It does not appear that the head was pinioned,\r\nas in modern times; but we could well understand how the feet of the\r\napostles were rendered lame by confinement in the Roman stocks.\r\n\r\n“The hall of ancient sculpture, chiefly from Pompeii and Herculaneum,\r\nwith some figures from Rome, powerfully attracted our attention. These\r\nsculptures, usually of full size, and sometimes colossal, are very fine.\r\nExcellent, manly forms, and noble, elevated features of men, and of\r\nwomen, worthy of such companions, with great variety of characteristic\r\nattitude, and in general, in full costume, served to convey to us, as we\r\nmay believe, a very perfect idea of the personal appearance of Roman\r\ncitizens of that age. The family of Balbus found in Herculaneum, is\r\nparticularly interesting. It is composed of the father, a noble figure,\r\nthe mother, equally impressive, and sons and daughters worthy of such\r\nparentage. Their features are calm and mild. It is a most interesting\r\ngroup, and in perfect preservation. The moral and intellectual\r\nexpression of the figures in these rooms—through a long series of\r\napartments and a host of figures—is as various as that of living people.\r\n\r\n“It is convenient to introduce here a notice of the Farnesian bull; for\r\nthis inimitable piece of sculpture is in this place, although it was not\r\nfound interred in Pompeii or Herculaneum, but buried among the ruins of\r\nthe baths of Caracalla. A large bull, of perfect and beautiful form, is\r\nrearing upon his hind legs, as if about to bound away in his course; but\r\nthis he is prevented from doing, as he is powerfully held by the horns\r\nand the nose by two resolute, athletic young men, one on each side, who\r\nhave him in such durance that his massive neck is wrinkled in large\r\nfolds, as he turns his head backward in his efforts to escape from their\r\ngrasp. The cause of the struggle becomes apparent, when we glance at a\r\nfine female form recumbent, and see that her abundant tresses are\r\ninterwoven with the strands of a rope which is noosed around the horns\r\nof the bull, and it flashes at once on the mind, that should the\r\nmaddened animal escape from his keepers, she will be quickly torn in\r\npieces. Her noble sons have, in a critical moment, sprung forward to her\r\nrescue, and are just able to arrest her impending fate. Filial love\r\nproves to be stronger than disapprobation of an imputed fault, for which\r\ntheir mother was to have been immolated by this horrible death. In such\r\na crisis we are not careful to balance the moral question: we\r\ninstinctively applaud the filial piety, and do not ask for the spirit of\r\nBrutus. This wonderful group was sculptured out of a single block of\r\nmarble of nine feet eight inches by thirteen feet, by Appollonius and\r\nTauriscus, two artists in Greece, from which country it was brought, to\r\ngrace the baths of Caracalla. It is truly wonderful that such a\r\nponderous mass, embracing so many figures, could be brought over seas,\r\nfrom a distant country, to Rome, and again be transported from that city\r\nto Naples, without injury, after being buried for fifteen centuries in\r\nthe baths of Caracalla.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              HERCULANEUM.\r\n\r\n“The same eruption which destroyed Pompeii, Stabiæ, Oplontia and\r\nTeglanum, entombed Herculaneum also. Its site was, however, unknown, as\r\nwell as that of the other buried towns; and the fatal event is only\r\noccasionally alluded to by the Roman writers. In the year 63, an\r\nearthquake had shattered these cities, a precursor of their coming doom.\r\nIn 1711, a peasant, in digging a well, discovered, at twenty feet depth,\r\npieces of colored marble. In 1713, the digging being continued, they\r\nstruck down into a temple, and discovered the statues of Cleopatra and\r\nHercules; and subsequent explorations disclosed the theater. Our time\r\nbeing very fully occupied with Pompeii on the day when we were there, we\r\nreserved to another opportunity a visit to Herculaneum. We descended\r\nquite conveniently down steps of stone, and arrived at the pit of the\r\ntheater, seventy-nine feet below the level of the main street of\r\nPortici, and Torre del Greco. With a guide, we proceeded, by the light\r\nof candles and torches, until we came to this subterranean theater,\r\nwhich had been filled with volcanic materials. I do not call it lava,\r\nbecause there is every reason to believe that, like Pompeii, Herculaneum\r\nwas buried by pumice, cinders, ashes, lapilli and sand. There has been\r\nmuch discussion on this subject; but had the buildings of Herculaneum\r\nbeen inclosed in heated lava, it is obvious that every fresco painting\r\nand marble would have been destroyed, and much more, the numerous papyri\r\nand other substances of an organic character, which have been found\r\nthere. Now it happens that the frescoes of Herculaneum, so far as it has\r\nbeen uncovered, are not only of a higher character in respect of art\r\nthan those in Pompeii, but also in better preservation. The solidity of\r\nthe material enveloping Herculaneum is easily understood, when we\r\nremember that it has been for over seventeen hundred years under the\r\nenormous pressure of seventy or eighty feet of superincumbent rock.\r\nSince the catastrophe of August, A. D. 79, numerous flows of molten lava\r\nhave passed over the site of Herculaneum; and these successive\r\naccumulations have amounted to the thickness just named. Add the effects\r\nof water, dissolving lime and silica, and infiltrating these materials\r\namong the loose pumice, and we see cause enough to account for the\r\nsolidification of these loose materials. Moreover, no sluggish and\r\nsemi-viscid lava (such as the Vesuvian lavas a short distance from their\r\noutlet always are) could ever have entered all the intricate passages of\r\nthe theater and other buildings; while a fluid magma of volcanic mud\r\nwould act in the same situation just as it is now found, like plaster of\r\nParis in a mold.\r\n\r\n“When we see with what labor and expense the excavations have been made\r\nin Herculaneum, and how difficult it is to dispose of the materials,\r\nwhich must be borne a long way through narrow passages like the\r\ngalleries of a mine, and raised nearly one hundred feet to the surface,\r\nwhere a populous town forbids the accumulation of rubbish; we are the\r\nmore easily reconciled to the suspension of the labor, and to the\r\nthrowing of the fragments into cavities that had been previously\r\nexcavated, and from which all interesting matters had been removed.\r\n\r\n“Discoveries in Herculaneum have been very numerous, but are so similar\r\nto those made in Pompeii that it is unnecessary to go much into detail\r\nbeyond what has been already mentioned. This city being, in fact,\r\ncontemporary with Pompeii, we should, of course, expect to find great\r\nsimilarity. It would seem, however, to have been a grander city, and\r\nprobably more populous. It has been computed that the theater would\r\ncontain ten thousand people, which would imply a large population. Two\r\ntemples were discovered, one of them one hundred and fifty feet by\r\nsixty. This contained a statue of Jupiter. Opposite to this was another\r\nbuilding of two hundred and twenty-eight feet by one hundred and\r\nthirty-two, supposed to have been constructed for the courts of justice.\r\nIt had a colonnade supporting a portico; its pavement was of marble, its\r\nwalls were frescoed, and there were bronze statues standing between the\r\nforty-two columns that supported the roof.\r\n\r\n“The theater is now the only public place that can be seen in\r\nHerculaneum, and the excavations have brought its form very distinctly\r\ninto view. Its marble seats and the pit have been so far cleared, that\r\nwe distinctly comprehend the design and plan. The galleries of access\r\nfrom the streets, and some of the rooms that were appendages of the\r\ntheater, have been opened. It appears to have had two principal gates\r\nand seven entrances, called vomitories. Many statues, and mosaics, and\r\nfrescoes, have been found in Herculaneum, and some of them, especially\r\nthe statues, are of surpassing beauty. We were desirous to see the famed\r\nimpression of a mask, and by holding a candle near to it the form could\r\nbe distinctly seen. The impression is in concave, and is that of a\r\nstrongly marked face of an adult; the copy is well defined, and\r\ncorresponds perfectly with a molding made by soft aqueous materials, and\r\nnot at all to one made by lava.\r\n\r\n“The well, by which the light was originally let down upon the theater,\r\nof course attracted our attention. It is now enlarged into a pit of\r\nfifteen to twenty feet in diameter, and narrowed toward the bottom to\r\nthe size of a common well; it descends far below the bottom of the\r\ntheater, and, like other wells, contains water. A flood of light flows\r\ndown through this orifice; and it is cheering to pass from the dark\r\nchambers of the theater, to look up again upon the light of heaven. The\r\nsubterranean walk, aided by candles, of which each person carries one,\r\nis, however, far from being unpleasant. Steps are cut in the solid mass,\r\nall obstacles are cleared away, and although we find it cool and damp,\r\nit is not gloomy, but in a high degree solemn and impressive. We are\r\nwalking in an ancient tomb—the tomb of a buried city—a city which was\r\nlarge and populous. It was active with pleasure and business long before\r\nour Saviour was on earth, and it was overwhelmed while some of his\r\napostles were still alive. How different was our situation here and at\r\nPompeii. In the latter city we walked the streets in open day and on the\r\ncommon level: here, we were deep down in a stony sepulcher; the mansions\r\nof the departed were all around us, but they were wrapped in solid rock.\r\nThe rumbling of the carriages in the streets of another city, whose busy\r\npopulation was passing nearly one hundred feet above our heads, was loud\r\nand incessant. It was an earthquake from above, and we could easily\r\nunderstand how the earthquake from below should so readily propagate its\r\nvibrations through many miles, or hundreds of miles, of solid materials.\r\nAmong the interesting places heretofore excavated, but now filled again,\r\nwere the basilica, the market, the scholæ, a columbarium, and the\r\nso-called villa of Aristides, in which papyrus, bronzes, rare mosaics,\r\nand all things that attested to the wealth and taste of the proprietor,\r\nwere found. In excavations made prior to 1728 they found the most\r\nsplendid house of the ancients that had ever been seen by modern eyes.\r\n\r\n“A great work on Herculaneum was published by royal authority, in the\r\nthirty-eight years intervening between 1754 and 1792, in nine folio\r\nvolumes, including the pictures, lamps, bronzes and candelabra; seven\r\nhundred and thirty-eight pictures were named in the catalogue, and the\r\nother articles were proportionally numerous. The work was presented, by\r\nroyal munificence, to the principal public libraries of Europe.\r\n\r\n“Both Herculaneum and Pompeii were mentioned with commendation by\r\nCicero. Both appear to have been favorite residences of the opulent\r\nRomans; both towns were in the first class of provincial cities, and\r\nHerculaneum especially was adorned by many villas. They had all the\r\npublic establishments that were usual in Rome. Indeed, the entire\r\ncircuit, from Cape Misenum around through the towns and villages of the\r\nbay of Baiæ, and onward through Naples to Herculaneum, and Pompeii, and\r\nStabiæ, appears to have been within the range of Roman sumptuousness,\r\nand a cherished resort for rural retirement from the eternal city.\r\n\r\n“The =papyri= of Pompeii are generally illegible, being penetrated by\r\nthe pulverulent material, which, aided by water, had usurped the place\r\nof the vegetable matter, or assimilated it to coal; a portion of it was\r\nfound to be soluble in naphtha. Those buried in Herculaneum were not\r\npenetrated by the enveloping matter; and the inscriptions, although\r\nblack like tinder, could still be read, as writing can often be seen\r\nupon burnt paper. The papyri MSS. were generally written in Greek; a few\r\nare in Latin. There is much variety of chirography, and there are many\r\nerasures. Tickets were attached to the bundles, stating the title of the\r\nwork. In a single villa in Herculaneum were found sixteen hundred and\r\nninety-six rolls of papyrus, of the eighteen hundred thus far known. In\r\n1819, four hundred and seven of the sixteen hundred and ninety-six had\r\nbeen unrolled, of which only eighty-eight were legible; twenty-four had\r\nbeen sent as presents to foreign princes; of the remaining twelve\r\nhundred and sixty-five, only from eighty to one hundred and twenty were\r\nin a state to promise any success, according to the chemical method at\r\nthat time recommended by Sir Humphrey Davy. The titles of four hundred\r\nof those least injured, which have been read, although new are\r\nunimportant, music, rhetoric and cookery being the chief subjects. There\r\nare two volumes of Epicurus on Nature, and there are other works by that\r\nschool. The rolls, in their coiled condition, were scarcely a span long,\r\nand two or three inches thick; they were made of pieces of Egyptian\r\npapyrus, glued together; some of the rolls were, when extended, forty or\r\nfifty feet long. The method found most successful for unrolling the\r\npapyri is to suspend them by silk cords in a glass case; and by\r\nattaching the delicate lining membrane of some species of bird to the\r\nback, with the aid of silken cords and regulated weights suspended by\r\npulleys, gravity slowly unfolds the brittle tissue at a rate of almost\r\ninappreciable tardiness. We were permitted to see this curious process.\r\n\r\n“A little further from Vesuvius than Pompeii, but in the same direction,\r\nwas Stabiæ, which was covered at the same time with the other cities.\r\nThe town of Castel del Mare is built over a portion of it. A part of\r\nStabiæ was excavated, but has been covered again, so that at present\r\nthere is nothing of it to be seen. Some manuscripts on papyrus were\r\nfound there, as at Herculaneum, but very few skeletons have been\r\ndiscovered; it is probable that most of the inhabitants had time to make\r\ntheir escape. I have elsewhere alluded to the death of the elder Pliny,\r\nwhich happened here. As commander of the Roman fleet, he was stationed\r\non the opposite side of the bay, at Cape Misenum; but the splendid\r\noutburst of Vesuvius, then novel, induced him, prompted by his humanity\r\nand by his zeal in natural science, to cross over with a few attendants;\r\nhe approached too near, and was constrained to remain over night. Being\r\ncorpulent and of an asthmatic habit, he was suffocated by the deadly\r\ngases exhaled in the volcanic tempest, which proved too much for his\r\npeculiar condition, and he died on the spot. The affecting and beautiful\r\nnarrative written by his nephew, the younger Pliny, addressed to the\r\nhistorian Tacitus, is familiar to the readers of Roman literature, and\r\ncan never be perused without a deep and painful interest.”\r\n\r\nWe would merely add, in closing this long but deeply interesting\r\nnarrative of the buried cities, that it is supposed that about one-third\r\nof the entire city of Pompeii is now uncovered, including four principal\r\nstreets, and all the important buildings of the ancient city. A long\r\nstreet, leading to the Stabian gate, is now being excavated; and in this\r\nstreet, one of the most remarkable discoveries has been made of any\r\nwhich have yet occurred; _viz._, _that of the complete roofing of a\r\nhouse_. As already stated, Pompeii, having been destroyed by falling\r\nashes, and then covered with earth, had suffered the loss of the roofs\r\nof its houses. Indeed, some supposed they had been carried away by a\r\nwhirlwind which they imagined must have preceded or attended the\r\nvolcanic eruption. The little care used in clearing away the incumbent\r\nmatter, had left us in the dark as to the construction of the ancient\r\nroofings. But quite recently, this discovery has been made of a complete\r\nroof of a house, formed of tiles, each about twelve inches square, with\r\ncoping tiles running between them; and over the backbone, so to speak,\r\nof the construction, a cement was applied to make the roofing\r\nwater-tight. So perfect is this roof, that it might have been\r\nconstructed yesterday; and it would suit a modern English or American\r\ncottage as well as a Roman dwelling. The whole is now inclosed in a\r\nrailing, and for the present will not probably be removed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              EARTHQUAKES.\r\n\r\n\r\n“He looketh on the earth, and it trembleth: he toucheth the hills, and\r\nthey smoke.”—PSALMS.\r\n\r\n                            “Towers, temples, palaces,\r\n            Flung from their deep foundations, roof on roof\r\n            Crushed horrible, and pile on pile o’erturned,\r\n            Fall total.”—MALLET.\r\n\r\n         “The globe around earth’s hollow surface shakes,\r\n         And is the ceiling of her sleeping sons.\r\n         O’er devastation we blind revels keep;\r\n         Whose buried towns support the dancer’s heel.”—YOUNG.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat fires, to a very great extent, and produced by various causes,\r\nexist at different depths beneath the surface of the earth, must be\r\nentirely evident to those who have perused the accounts of volcanoes in\r\nour previous pages; and recent experiments have shown, that where the\r\nsubstances in which such fires occur, lie at a considerable depth, and\r\nare surmounted by a very deep and heavy superincumbent pressure, more\r\nespecially when they contain large portions of elastic gases, the effect\r\nof such fires will be much greater, and more diversified, than where\r\nthese circumstances are absent.\r\n\r\nAmong the most powerful and extraordinary of these effects earthquakes\r\nare to be reckoned. They are unquestionably the most dreadful of the\r\nphenomena of nature, and are not confined to those countries which, from\r\nthe influence of climate, their vicinity to volcanic mountains, or any\r\nother similar cause, have been considered as more particularly subject\r\nto them, their effects having oft been felt in North America, although\r\nnot in so extensive and calamitous a degree. Their shocks and the\r\neruptions of volcanoes, have been considered as modifications of the\r\neffects of one common cause; and where the agitation produced by an\r\nearthquake extends further than there is reason to suspect a\r\nsubterraneous commotion, it is probably propagated through the earth\r\nnearly in the same way that a noise is conveyed through the air. The\r\ndifferent hypotheses which have been imagined on this subject may be\r\nreduced to the following. Some naturalists have ascribed earthquakes to\r\nwater, others to fire, and others, again, to air; each of these powerful\r\nagents being supposed to operate in the bowels of the earth, which they\r\nassert to abound everywhere with huge subterraneous caverns, veins and\r\ncanals, some filled with water, others with gaseous exhalations, and\r\nothers replete with various substances, such as niter, sulphur, bitumen\r\nand vitriol. Each of these opinions has its advocates, who have written\r\ncopiously on the subject.\r\n\r\nIn a paper published in the “Philosophical Transactions,” Dr. Lister\r\nascribes earthquakes, as well as thunder and lightning, to the\r\ninflammable breath of the pyrites, a substantial sulphur, capable of\r\nspontaneous combustion; in a word, as Pliny had observed before him, he\r\nsupposes an earthquake to be nothing more than subterraneous thunder.\r\nDr. Woodward thinks, that the subterraneous fire which continually\r\nraises the water from the abyss, or great reservoir, in the center of\r\nthe earth, for the supply of dew, rain, springs and rivers, being\r\ndiverted from its ordinary course by some accidental obstruction in the\r\npores through which it is used to ascend to the surface, becomes, by\r\nsuch means, preternaturally assembled in a greater quantity than usual,\r\nin one place, and thus causes a rarefaction and intumescence of the\r\nwater of the abyss, throwing it into greater commotions, and at the same\r\ntime making the like effort on the earth, which, being expanded on the\r\nsurface of the abyss, occasions an earthquake. Mr. Mitchell supposes\r\nthese phenomena to be occasioned by subterraneous fires, which, if a\r\nlarge quantity of water be let loose on them suddenly, may produce a\r\nvapor, the quantity and elastic force of which may fully suffice for the\r\npurpose. Again, M. Amontus, a member of the French Academy of Sciences,\r\nendeavors to prove, that, on the principle of experiments made on the\r\nweight and elasticity of the air, a moderate degree of heat may bring\r\nthat element into a state capable of causing earthquakes.\r\n\r\nModern electrical discoveries have thrown much light on this subject.\r\nDr. Stukely strenuously denies that earthquakes are to be ascribed to\r\nsubterraneous winds, fires or vapors, and thinks that there is not any\r\nevidence of the cavernous structure of the earth, which such a\r\nhypothesis requires. Subterraneous vapors he thinks, are altogether\r\ninadequate to the effects produced by earthquakes, more particularly in\r\ncases where the shock is of considerable extent: for a subterraneous\r\npower, capable of moving a surface of earth only thirty miles in\r\ndiameter, must be lodged at least fifteen or twenty miles below the\r\nsurface, and move an inverted cone of solid earth, whose basis is thirty\r\nmiles in diameter, and its axis fifteen or twenty miles, which he thinks\r\nabsolutely impossible. How much more inconceivable is it, then, that any\r\nsuch power could have produced the earthquake of 1755, which was felt in\r\nvarious parts of Europe and Africa, and in the Atlantic ocean; or that\r\nwhich in Asia Minor, in the seventeenth year of the Christian era,\r\ndestroyed thirteen great cities in one night, and shook a mass of earth\r\nthree hundred miles in diameter. To effect this, the moving power,\r\nsupposing it to have been internal fire or vapor, must have been lodged\r\ntwo hundred miles beneath the surface of the earth! Besides, in\r\nearthquakes, the effect is instantaneous; whereas the operation of\r\nelastic vapor, and its discharge, must be gradual, and require a long\r\nspace of time; and if these be owing to explosions, they must alter the\r\nsurface of the country where they happen, destroy the fountains and\r\nsprings, and change the course of its rivers, results which are\r\ncontradicted by history and observation.\r\n\r\nTo these and other considerations the doctor adds, that the strokes\r\nwhich ships receive during an earthquake, must be occasioned by\r\nsomething which can communicate motion with much greater velocity than\r\nany heaving of the earth under the sea, caused by the elasticity of\r\ngenerated vapors, which would merely produce a gradual swell, and not\r\nsuch an impulsion of the water as resembles a violent blow on the bottom\r\nof a ship, or its striking on a rock. Hence he deems the common\r\nhypothesis insufficient, and adduces several reasons to show that\r\nearthquakes are in reality electric shocks. To confirm this opinion, he\r\nnotices, among other phenomena, either preceding or attending\r\nearthquakes, that the weather is usually dry and warm for some time\r\nbefore they happen, and that the surface of the ground is thus\r\npreviously prepared for that kind of electrical vibration in which they\r\nconsist; while, at the same time, in several places where they have\r\noccurred, the internal parts, at a small depth beneath the surface, were\r\nmoist and boggy. Hence he infers, that they reach very little beneath\r\nthe surface. That the southern regions are more subject to earthquakes\r\nthan the northern, he thinks is owing to the greater warmth and dryness\r\nof the earth and air, which are qualities so necessary to electricity.\r\nIt may here be noticed, that, before the earthquakes of London, in 1749,\r\nall vegetation was remarkably forward; and it is well known, that\r\nelectricity quickens vegetation. The frequent and singular appearance of\r\nboreal and austral _auroræ_, and the variety of meteors by which\r\nearthquakes are preceded, indicate an electrical state of the\r\natmosphere; and the doctor apprehends that, in this state of the earth\r\nand air, nothing more is necessary to produce these phenomena, than the\r\napproach of a non-electric cloud, and the discharge of its contents, on\r\nany part of the earth, when in a highly electrified state. In the same\r\nway as the discharge from an excited tube occasions a commotion in the\r\nhuman body, so the shock produced by the discharge between the cloud and\r\nmany miles in compass of solid earth, must be an earthquake, and the\r\nsnap from the contact the noise attending it.\r\n\r\nThe theory of M. de St. Lazare differs from the above hypothesis, as\r\nto the electrical cause. It ascribes the production of earthquakes to\r\nthe interruption of the equilibrium between the electrical matter\r\ndiffused in the atmosphere, and that which belongs to the mass of our\r\nglobe, and pervades its bowels. If the electrical fluid should be\r\nsuperabundant, as may happen from a variety of causes, its current, by\r\nthe laws of motion peculiar to fluids, is carried toward those places\r\nwhere it is in a similar quantity; and thus it will sometimes pass\r\nfrom the internal parts of the globe into the atmosphere. This\r\nhappening, if the equilibrium be reëstablished without difficulty, the\r\ncurrent merely produces the effect of what M. de St. Lazare calls\r\nascending thunder; but if this reëstablishment be opposed by\r\nconsiderable and multiplied obstacles, the consequence is then an\r\nearthquake, the violence and extent of which are in exact proportion\r\nto the degree of interruption of the equilibrium, the depth of the\r\nelectric matter, and the obstacles which are to be surmounted. If the\r\nelectric furnace be sufficiently large and deep to give rise to the\r\nformation of a conduit or issue, the production of a volcano will\r\nfollow, its successive eruptions being, according to him, nothing more\r\nin reality than electric repulsions of the substances contained in the\r\nbowels of the earth. From this reasoning he endeavors to deduce the\r\npracticability of forming a counter-earthquake, and a counter-volcano,\r\nby means of certain electrical conductors, which he describes, so as\r\nto prevent these convulsions in the bowels of the earth.\r\n\r\nThe opinion of Signior Beccaria is nearly similar; and from his\r\nhypothesis and that of Dr. Stukely, the celebrated Priestly has\r\nendeavored to form one still more general and more feasible. He supposes\r\nthe electric fluid to be, in some mode or other, accumulated on one part\r\nof the surface of the earth, and, on account of the dryness of the\r\nseason, not to diffuse itself readily: it may thus, as Beccaria\r\nconjectures, force its way into the higher regions of the air, forming\r\nclouds out of the vapors which float in the atmosphere, and may occasion\r\na sudden shower, which may further promote its progress. The whole\r\nsurface being thus unloaded, will, like any other conducting substance,\r\nreceive a concussion, either on parting with, or on receiving any\r\nquantity of the electric fluid. The rushing noise will likewise sweep\r\nover the whole extent of the country; and, on this supposition also, the\r\nfluid, in its discharge from the surface of the earth, will naturally\r\nfollow the course of the rivers, and will take the advantage of any\r\neminences to facilitate its ascent into the higher regions of the air.\r\n\r\nSuch are the arguments in favor of the electrical hypothesis; but, since\r\nit has been supported with so much ability, an ingenious writer,\r\nWhitehurst, in his “Inquiry into the Original State and Formation of the\r\nEarth,” contends that subterraneous fire, and the steam generated from\r\nit, are the true and real causes of earthquakes. When, he observes, it\r\nis considered that the expansive force of steam is to that of gunpowder\r\nas twenty-eight to one, it may be conceded that this expansive force,\r\nand the elasticity of steam, are in every way capable of producing the\r\nstupendous effects attributed to these phenomena. This is, now, the\r\nalmost universally received theory as to the cause of earthquakes, that\r\nthey originate in the same general causes which produce volcanoes; that\r\nis, from the action of the heat and fires that are found in the interior\r\nof the earth. When these fires find ready vent, they produce the\r\noverflowing volcano; but when shut up and confined, their force is so\r\ngreat as to shake the solid crust of the globe which covers them.\r\n\r\nAmong the most striking phenomena of earthquakes, which present a\r\nfearful assemblage of the combined effects of air, earth, fire and\r\nwater, in a state of unrestrained contention, may be noticed the\r\nfollowing. Before the percussion a rumbling sound is heard, proceeding\r\neither from the air, or from fire, or, perhaps, from both in\r\nconjunction, forcing their way through the chasms of the earth, and\r\nendeavoring to liberate themselves: this, as has been seen, likewise\r\nhappens in volcanic eruptions. Secondly, a violent agitation or heaving\r\nof the sea, sometimes preceding, and sometimes following the shock: this\r\nis also a volcanic effect. Thirdly, a spouting up of the waters to a\r\ngreat hight, a phenomenon which is common to earthquakes and volcanoes,\r\nand which can not be readily accounted for. Fourthly, a rocking of the\r\nearth, and, occasionally, what may be termed a perpendicular rebounding:\r\nthis diversity has been supposed by some naturalists to arise chiefly\r\nfrom the situation of the place, relatively to the subterraneous fire,\r\nwhich, when immediately beneath, causes the earth to rise, and when at a\r\ndistance, to rock. Fifthly, earthquakes are sometimes observed to travel\r\nonward, so as to be felt in different countries at different hours of\r\nthe same day. This may be accounted for by the violent shock given to\r\nthe earth at one place, and communicated progressively by an undulatory\r\nmotion, successively affecting different regions as it passes along, in\r\nthe same way as the blow given by a stone thrown into a lake, is not\r\nperceived at the shore until some time after the first concussion.\r\nSixthly, the shock is sometimes instantaneous, like the explosion of\r\ngunpowder, and sometimes tremulous, lasting for several minutes. The\r\nnearer to the observer the place where the shock is first given, the\r\nmore instantaneous and simple it appears; while, at a greater distance,\r\nthe earth seems to redouble the first blow, with a sort of vibratory\r\ncontinuation. Lastly, as the waters have in general so great a share in\r\nthe production of earthquakes, it is not surprising that they should\r\ngenerally follow the breaches made by the force of fire, and appear in\r\nthe great chasms opened by the earth.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     EARTHQUAKES OF ANCIENT TIMES.\r\n\r\nThe earliest earthquake, worthy of notice, of which we have any record,\r\nwas that which in the year 63 so severely injured Herculaneum and\r\nPompeii, and from the effects of which they had not been restored when\r\nthey were overwhelmed by the volcano. Some of the most remarkable\r\nearthquakes of ancient times are described by Pliny. Among the most\r\nextensive and destructive of these, was the one already noticed, by\r\nwhich thirteen cities in Asia Minor were swallowed up in one night.\r\nAnother which succeeded, shook the greater part of Italy. But the most\r\nextraordinary one, described by him, happened during the consulate of\r\nLucius Marcus and Sextus Julius, in the Roman province of Mutina. He\r\nrelates, that two mountains felt so tremendous a shock, that they seemed\r\nto approach and retire with a most dreadful noise. They at the same\r\ntime, and in the middle of the day, cast forth fire and smoke, to the\r\ndismay of the astonished spectator. By this shock several towns were\r\ndestroyed, and all the animals in their vicinity killed. During the\r\nreign of Trajan, the city of Antioch was, together with a great part of\r\nthe adjacent country, destroyed by an earthquake; and about three\r\nhundred years after, during the reign of Justinian, it was again\r\ndestroyed, with the loss of forty thousand of its inhabitants. Lastly,\r\nafter an interval of sixty years, that ill-fated city was a third time\r\noverwhelmed, with a loss of sixty thousand souls. The earthquake which\r\nhappened at Rhodes, upward of two hundred years before the Christian\r\nera, threw down the famous colossus, together with the arsenal, and a\r\ngreat part of the walls of the city. In the year 1182, the greater part\r\nof the cities of Syria, and of the kingdom of Jerusalem, were destroyed\r\nby a similar catastrophe; and in 1594, the Italian writers describe an\r\nearthquake at Puteoli, which occasioned the sea to retire two hundred\r\nyards from its former bed.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        EARTHQUAKE IN CALABRIA.\r\n\r\nThe dreadful earthquake which happened in Calabria, in 1638, is\r\ndescribed by the Jesuit Kircher, who was at that time on his way to\r\nSicily to visit Mount Etna. In approaching the gulf of Charybdis, it\r\nappeared to whirl round in such a manner as to form a vast hollow,\r\nverging to a point in the center. On looking toward Etna, it was seen to\r\nemit large volumes of smoke, of a mountainous size, which entirely\r\ncovered the whole island, and obscured from his view the very shores.\r\nThis, together with the dreadful noise, and the sulphurous stench, which\r\nwas strongly perceptible, filled him with apprehensions that a still\r\nmore dreadful calamity was impending. The sea was agitated, covered with\r\nbubbles, and had altogether a very unusual appearance. His surprise was\r\nstill more increased by the serenity of the weather, there not being a\r\nbreath of air, nor a cloud, which might be supposed to put all nature\r\nthus in motion. He therefore warned his companions that an earthquake\r\nwas approaching, and landed with all possible diligence at Tropæa, in\r\nCalabria.\r\n\r\nHe had scarcely reached the Jesuits’ college, when his ears were stunned\r\nwith a horrid sound, resembling that of an infinite number of chariots\r\ndriven fiercely forward, the wheels rattling, and the thongs cracking.\r\nThe tract on which he stood seemed to vibrate, as if he had been in the\r\nscale of a balance which still continued to waver. The motion soon\r\nbecoming more violent, he was thrown prostrate on the ground. The\r\nuniversal ruin around him now redoubled his amazement: the crash of\r\nfalling houses, the tottering of towers, and the groans of the dying,\r\nall contributed to excite emotions of terror and despair. Danger\r\nthreatened him wherever he should flee; but, having remained unhurt amid\r\nthe general concussion, he resolved to venture for safety, and reached\r\nthe shore, almost terrified out of his reason. Here he found his\r\ncompanions, whose terrors were still greater than his own. He landed on\r\nthe following day at Rochetta, where the earth still continued to be\r\nviolently agitated. He had, however, scarcely reached the inn at which\r\nhe intended to lodge, when he was once more obliged to return to the\r\nboat: in about half an hour the greater part of the town, including the\r\ninn, was overwhelmed, and the inhabitants buried beneath its ruins.\r\n\r\nNot finding any safety on land, and exposed, by the smallness of the\r\nboat to a very hazardous passage by sea, he at length landed at\r\nLopizium, a castle midway between Tropæa and Euphæmia, the city to which\r\nhe was bound. Here, wherever he turned his eyes, nothing but scenes of\r\nruin and horror appeared: towns and castles were leveled to the ground;\r\nwhile Stromboli, although sixty miles distant, was seen to vomit flames\r\nin an unusual manner, and with a noise which he could distinctly hear.\r\nFrom remote objects his attention was soon diverted to contiguous\r\ndanger: the rumbling sound of an approaching earthquake, with which he\r\nwas by this time well acquainted, alarmed him for the consequences.\r\nEvery instant it grew louder, as if approaching; and the spot on which\r\nhe stood shook so dreadfully, that being unable to stand, he and his\r\ncompanions caught hold of the shrubs which grew nearest to them, and in\r\nthat manner supported themselves.\r\n\r\nThis violent paroxysm having ceased, he now thought of prosecuting his\r\nvoyage to Euphæmia, which lay within a short distance. Turning his eyes\r\ntoward that city, he could merely perceive a terrific dark cloud, which\r\nseemed to rest on the place. He was the more surprised at this, as the\r\nweather was remarkably serene. Waiting, therefore, until this cloud had\r\npassed away, he turned to look for the city; but, alas! it was totally\r\nsunk, and in its place a dismal and putrid lake was to be seen. All was\r\na melancholy solitude, a scene of hideous desolation. Such was the fate\r\nof the city of Euphæmia; and the other devastating effects of this\r\nearthquake were so great, that along the whole coast of that part of\r\nItaly, for the space of two hundred miles, the remains of ruined towns\r\nand villages were everywhere to be seen, and the inhabitants, without\r\ndwellings, dispersed over the fields. Kircher at length terminated his\r\ndistressful voyage, by reaching Naples, after having escaped a variety\r\nof perils both by sea and land.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     THE GREAT EARTHQUAKE OF 1755.\r\n\r\nThis very remarkable and destructive earthquake extended over a tract of\r\nat least four millions of square miles. It appears to have originated\r\nbeneath the Atlantic ocean, the waves of which received almost as\r\nviolent a concussion as the land. Its effects were even extended to the\r\nwaters, in many places where the shocks were not perceptible. It\r\npervaded the greater portions of the continents of Europe, Africa and\r\nAmerica; but its extreme violence was exercised on the south-western\r\npart of the former.\r\n\r\nLisbon, the Portuguese capital, had already suffered greatly from an\r\nearthquake in 1531; and, since the calamity about to be described, has\r\nhad three such visitations, in 1761, 1765, and 1772, which were not,\r\nhowever, attended by equally disastrous consequences. In the present\r\ninstance it had been remarked that since the commencement of the year\r\n1750, less rain had fallen than had been known in the memory of the\r\noldest of the inhabitants, unless during the spring preceding the\r\ncalamitous event. The summer had been unusually cool; and the weather\r\nfine and clear for the last forty days. At length, on the first of\r\nNovember, about forty minutes past nine in the morning, a most violent\r\nshock of an earthquake was felt; its duration did not exceed six\r\nseconds; but so powerful was the concussion, that it overthrew every\r\nchurch and convent in the city, together with the royal palace, and the\r\nmagnificent opera house adjoining to it; in short, no building of any\r\nconsequence escaped. About one-fourth of the dwelling-houses were thrown\r\ndown; and, at a moderate computation, thirty thousand persons perished.\r\nThe sight of the dead bodies, and the shrieks of those who were\r\nhalf-buried in the ruins, were terrible beyond description; and so great\r\nwas the consternation, that the most resolute man durst not stay a\r\nmoment to extricate the friend he loved most affectionately, by the\r\nremoval of the stones beneath the weight of which he was crushed.\r\nSelf-preservation alone was consulted; and the most probable security\r\nwas sought, by getting into open places, and into the middle of the\r\nstreets. Those who were in the upper stories of the houses, were in\r\ngeneral more fortunate than those who attempted to escape by the doors,\r\nmany of the latter being buried beneath the ruins, with the greater part\r\nof the foot-passengers. Those who were in carriages escaped the best,\r\nalthough the drivers and horses suffered severely. The number, however,\r\nof those who perished in the streets, and in the houses, was greatly\r\ninferior to that of those who were buried beneath the ruins of the\r\nchurches; for, as it was a day of solemn festival, these were crowded\r\nfor the celebration of the mass. There were very many of these churches;\r\nand the lofty steeples in most instances, fell with the roof, insomuch\r\nthat few escaped.\r\n\r\nThe first shock, as has been noticed, was extremely short, but was\r\nquickly succeeded by two others; and the whole, generally described as a\r\nsingle shock, lasted from five to seven minutes. About two hours after,\r\nfires broke out in three different parts of the city; and this new\r\ncalamity prevented the digging out of the immense riches concealed\r\nbeneath the ruins. From a perfect calm, a fresh gale immediately after\r\nsprang up, and occasioned the fire to rage with such fury, that in the\r\nspace of three days the city was nearly reduced to ashes. Every element\r\nseemed to conspire toward its destruction; for, soon after the shock,\r\nwhich happened near high-water, the tide rose in an instant forty feet,\r\nand at the castle of Belem, which defended the entrance of the harbor,\r\nfifty feet higher than had ever been known. Had it not subsided as\r\nsuddenly, the whole city would have been submerged. A large new quay\r\nsunk to an unfathomable depth, with several hundreds of persons, not one\r\nof the bodies of whom was afterward found. Before the sea thus came\r\nrolling in like a mountain, the bar was seen dry from the shore.\r\n\r\nThe terrors of the surviving inhabitants were great and multiplied. Amid\r\nthe general confusion, and through a scarcity of hands, the dead bodies\r\ncould not be buried, and it was dreaded that a pestilence would ensue;\r\nbut from this apprehension they were relieved by the fire, by which\r\nthese bodies were for the greater part consumed. The fears of a famine\r\nwere more substantial; since, during the three days succeeding the\r\nearthquake, an ounce of bread was literally worth a pound of gold.\r\nSeveral of the corn magazines having been, however, fortunately saved\r\nfrom the fire, a scanty supply of bread was afterward procured. Next\r\ncame the dread of the pillage and murder of those who had saved any of\r\ntheir effects; and this happened in several instances, until examples\r\nwere made of the delinquents. The great shock was succeeded about noon\r\nby another, when the walls of several houses which were still standing,\r\nwere seen to open, from the top to the bottom, more than a fourth of a\r\nyard, and afterward to close again so exactly as not to leave any signs\r\nof injury. Between the first and the eighth of November twenty-two\r\nshocks were reckoned.\r\n\r\nA boat on the river, about a mile distant from Lisbon, was heard by the\r\npassengers to make a noise as if it had run aground, although then in\r\ndeep water: they at the same time saw the houses falling on both sides\r\nof the river, in front of which, on the Lisbon side, the greater part of\r\na convent fell, burying many of its inmates beneath the ruins, while\r\nothers were precipitated into the river. The water was covered with\r\ndust, blown by a strong northerly wind; and the sun entirely obscured.\r\nOn landing, they were driven by the overflowing of the waters to the\r\nhigh grounds, whence they perceived the sea, at a mile’s distance,\r\nrushing in like a torrent, although against wind and tide. The bed of\r\nthe Tagus was in many places raised to its surface; while ships were\r\ndriven from their anchors, and jostled together with such violence that\r\ntheir crews did not know whether they were afloat or aground. The master\r\nof a ship, who had great difficulty in reaching the port of Lisbon,\r\nreported that, being fifty leagues at sea, the shock was there so\r\nviolent as to damage the deck of the vessel. He fancied he had mistaken\r\nhis reckoning, and struck on a rock.\r\n\r\nThe following observations, relative to this fatal earthquake, were made\r\nat Colares, about twenty miles from Lisbon, and within two miles of the\r\nsea. On the last day of October, the weather was clear, and remarkably\r\nwarm for the season. About four o’clock in the afternoon a fog arose,\r\nproceeding from the sea, and covering the valleys, which was very\r\nunusual at that season of the year. The wind shifted soon after to the\r\neast, and the fog returned to the sea, collecting itself, and becoming\r\nexceedingly thick. As the fog retired, the sea rose with a prodigious\r\nroaring. On the first of November, the day broke with a serene sky, the\r\nwind continuing at the east; but about nine o’clock the sun began to be\r\nobscured; and about half an hour after a rumbling noise was heard,\r\nresembling that of chariots, and increasing to such a degree, that at\r\nlength it became equal to the explosions of the largest artillery.\r\nImmediately a shock of an earthquake was felt; and this was succeeded by\r\na second and a third, at the same time that several light flames of\r\nfire, resembling the kindling of charcoal, issued from the mountains.\r\nDuring these three shocks, the walls of the buildings moved from east to\r\nwest. In another spot, where the sea-coast could be descried, a great\r\nquantity of smoke, very thick, but somewhat pale, issued from the hill\r\nnamed the Fojo. This increased with the fourth shock, at noon, and\r\nafterward continued to issue in a greater or less degree. At the instant\r\nthe subterraneous rumblings were heard, the smoke was observed to burst\r\nforth at the Fojo; and its volume was constantly proportioned to the\r\nnoise. On visiting the spot whence it was seen to arise, no sign of fire\r\ncould be perceived near it. After the earthquake, several fountains were\r\ndried up; while others, after undergoing great changes, returned to\r\ntheir pristine state. In places where there had not been any water,\r\nsprings burst forth, and continued to flow; several of these spouted to\r\nthe hight of nearly twenty feet, and threw up sand of various colors. On\r\nthe hills, rocks were split, and the earth rent; while toward the coast\r\nseveral large portions of rock were thrown from the eminences into the\r\nsea.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EARTHQUAKE AT LISBON.]\r\n\r\nAt Oporto, the earthquake was felt with great violence. The river\r\ncontinued to rise and fall five or six feet, for four hours; the houses\r\nof the city were rocked as if by convulsions, and the earth was seen to\r\nheave up. St. Ubes, twenty miles distant, was entirely swallowed up by\r\nthe repeated shocks, and by the vast surf of the sea. And at Cadiz it\r\nwas so violent, that, but for the great solidity of the buildings,\r\neverything would have been destroyed. Those who had quitted the houses\r\nand churches, seeking safety in the open air, had scarcely recovered\r\nfrom their first terror, when they were plunged into a new alarm. At ten\r\nminutes after eleven o’clock, a wave was seen coming from the sea at the\r\ndistance of eight miles, and at least sixty feet higher than usual. It\r\ndashed against the west part of the city, which is very rocky. Although\r\nits force was much broken by these rocks, it at length reached the\r\nwalls, and beat in the breastwork, which was sixty feet above the\r\nordinary level of the water, removing pieces of the fabric, of the\r\nweight of eight or ten tuns, to the distance of forty or fifty yards. At\r\nhalf past eleven came a second wave; and this was followed by four\r\nothers of equal magnitude. Others, but smaller, and gradually lessening,\r\ncontinued at uncertain intervals until the evening. A considerable part\r\nof the rampart was thrown down, and carried by the torrent above fifty\r\npaces. Several persons perished on the causeway leading to the isle of\r\nLesu. The accounts brought to Cadiz reported that Seville had been much\r\ndamaged, and that a similar fate had attended St. Lucar and Cheres.\r\nConel was said to have been destroyed; and, indeed, with the exception\r\nof the provinces of Catalonia, Aragon and Valencia, the effects of this\r\nearthquake were felt throughout Spain.\r\n\r\nAt Madrid the shock was very sensibly felt soon after ten in the\r\nmorning, and lasted five or six minutes. At first the inhabitants\r\nfancied they were seized with a swimming in the head; and, afterward,\r\nthat the houses were falling. In the churches the sensations were the\r\nsame, and the terror so great, that the people trod each other under\r\nfoot in getting out. Those who were within the towers were still more\r\naffrighted, fancying every instant while the shock lasted, that they\r\nwere falling to the ground. It was not sensible to those who were in\r\ncarriages, and very little so to foot-passengers.\r\n\r\nAt Gibraltar it was felt about the same time as at Madrid, and began\r\nwith a tremulous motion of the earth, which lasted about half a minute.\r\nA violent shock succeeded; and this again was followed by a second\r\ntremulous motion, of the duration of five or six seconds. Another shock,\r\nnot so violent as the first, subsided gradually; and the whole lasted\r\nabout two minutes. Several of the guns on the batteries were seen to\r\nrise, and others to sink, while the earth had an undulating motion. The\r\ngreater part of the garrison and inhabitants were seized with giddiness\r\nand sickness: several fell prostrate; others were stupefied; and many\r\nwho were walking or riding, became sick, without being sensible of any\r\nmotion of the earth. Every fifteen minutes the sea rose six feet; and\r\nthen fell so low, that the boats and small vessels near the shore were\r\nleft aground, as were also numbers of small fish. The flux and reflux\r\nlasted till next morning, having decreased gradually from two in the\r\nafternoon.\r\n\r\nIn Africa, this earthquake was felt almost as severely as it had been in\r\nEurope. A great part of the city of Algiers was destroyed. At Arzilla, a\r\ntown belonging to the kingdom of Fez, about ten in the morning, the sea\r\nsuddenly rose with such impetuosity, that it lifted up a vessel in the\r\nbay, and impelled it with such force on the land, that it was shattered\r\nin pieces; and a boat was found two musket-shots within land from the\r\nsea. At Fez and Mequinez, great numbers of houses fell down, and a\r\nmultitude of people were buried beneath the ruins. At Morocco, similar\r\naccidents occurred; and at Salle also, much damage was done. At Tangier\r\nthe earthquake began at ten in the morning, and lasted ten or twelve\r\nminutes. At Tetuan it commenced at the same time, but was of less\r\nduration; three of the shocks were so extremely violent, that it was\r\nfeared the whole city would be destroyed.\r\n\r\nIn the city of Funchal, in the island of Madeira, a shock of this\r\nearthquake was felt at thirty-eight minutes past nine in the morning. It\r\nwas preceded by a rumbling noise in the air, like that of empty\r\ncarriages passing hastily over a stone pavement. The observer felt the\r\nfloor beneath him immediately to be agitated by a tremulous motion,\r\nvibrating very quickly. The shock continued more than a minute; during\r\nwhich space the vibrations, although continual, were twice very sensibly\r\nweakened and increased in force. The increase after the first remission\r\nof the shock was the most intense. During the whole of its continuance\r\nit was accompanied by a noise in the air; and this lasted some seconds\r\nafter the motion of the earth had ceased, dying away like a peal of\r\ndistant thunder rolling through the air. At three-quarters past eleven,\r\nthe sea, which was quite calm, suddenly retired several paces; when\r\nrising with a great swell, and without any noise, it as suddenly\r\nadvanced, overflowed the shore, and entered the city. It rose fifteen\r\nfeet perpendicularly above high-water mark, although the tide, which\r\nthere flows seven feet, was at half-ebb. The water immediately receded;\r\nand after having fluctuated four or five times between high and low\r\nwater mark, it subsided, and the sea remained calm as before. In the\r\nnorthern part of the island the inundation was more violent, the sea\r\nthere retiring above a hundred paces at first, and suddenly returning,\r\noverflowed the shore, forcing open doors, breaking down the walls of\r\nseveral magazines and storehouses, and leaving great quantities of fish\r\nashore and in the streets of the village of Machico. All this was the\r\neffect of one rising of the sea, for it never afterward flowed high\r\nenough to reach the high-water mark. It continued, however, to fluctuate\r\nhere much longer before it subsided than at Funchal; and in some places\r\nfurther to the westward, it was hardly, if at all, perceptible.\r\n\r\nThese were the phenomena with which this remarkable earthquake was\r\nattended, in those places where it was most violent. The effects of it,\r\nhowever, reached to an immense distance; and were perceived chiefly by\r\nthe agitations of the waters, or some slight motion of the earth. Its\r\nutmost boundaries to the south are unknown; the barbarousness of the\r\nAfrican nations rendering it impossible to procure any intelligence from\r\nthem, except where the effects were dreadful. On the north, however, we\r\nare assured, that it reached as far as Norway and Sweden. In the former\r\nkingdom, the waters of several rivers and lakes were violently agitated.\r\nIn the latter, shocks were felt in several provinces, and all the rivers\r\nand lakes were strongly agitated, especially in Dalecarlia. The river\r\nDala suddenly overflowed its banks, and as suddenly retired. At the same\r\ntime, a lake at the distance of a league from it, and with which it had\r\nno manner of communication, bubbled up with great violence. At Fahlun, a\r\ntown in Dalecarlia, several strong shocks were felt.\r\n\r\nIn many places of Germany the effects of this earthquake were very\r\nperceptible; but in Holland, the agitations were still more remarkable.\r\nAt Alphen on the Rhine, between Leyden and Woerden, in the afternoon of\r\nthe first of November, the waters were agitated to such a violent\r\ndegree, that buoys were broken from their chains, large vessels snapped\r\ntheir cables, small ones were thrown out of the water upon the land, and\r\nothers lying on land were set afloat. At Amsterdam, about eleven in the\r\nforenoon, the air being perfectly calm, the waters were suddenly\r\nagitated in the canals, so that several boats broke loose; chandeliers\r\nwere observed to vibrate in the churches; but no motion of the earth, or\r\nconcussion of any building was observed. At Haerlem, in the forenoon,\r\nfor nearly four minutes, not only the waters in the rivers, canals, &c.,\r\nbut also all kinds of fluids in smaller quantities, as in coolers, tubs,\r\n&c., were surprisingly agitated, and dashed over the sides, though no\r\nmotion was perceptible in the vessels themselves. In these small\r\nquantities also the fluid apparently ascended prior to its turbulent\r\nmotion; and in many places, even the rivers and canals rose one foot\r\nperpendicularly.\r\n\r\nThe agitation of the waters was also perceived in various parts of Great\r\nBritain and Ireland. At Barlborough, in Derbyshire, between eleven and\r\ntwelve in the forenoon, in a boat-house on the west side of a large body\r\nof water, called Pibley Dam, supposed to cover at least thirty acres of\r\nland, was heard a surprising and terrible noise; a large swell of water\r\ncame in a current from the south, and rose two feet on the sloped\r\ndam-head at the north end of the water. It then subsided, but returned\r\nagain immediately, though with less violence. The water was thus\r\nagitated for three-quarters of an hour; but the current grew every time\r\nweaker and weaker, till at last it entirely ceased.\r\n\r\nAt Busbridge, in Surrey, at half an hour after ten in the morning, the\r\nweather being remarkably still, without the least wind, in a canal\r\nnearly seven hundred feet long, and fifty-eight in breadth, with a small\r\nspring constantly running through it, a very unusual noise was heard at\r\nthe east end, and the water there observed to be in great agitation. It\r\nraised itself in a heap or ridge in the middle; and this heap extended\r\nlengthwise about thirty yards, rising between two and three feet above\r\nthe usual level. After this, the ridge heeled or vibrated toward the\r\nnorth side of the canal, with great force, and flowed above eight feet\r\nover the grass walk on that side. On its return back into the canal, it\r\nagain ridged in the middle, and then heeled with yet greater force to\r\nthe south side, and flowed over its grass walk. During this latter\r\nmotion, the bottom on the north side was left dry for several feet. This\r\nappearance lasted for about a quarter of an hour, after which the water\r\nbecame smooth and quiet as before. During the whole time, the sand at\r\nthe bottom was thrown up and mixed with the water; and there was a\r\ncontinual noise like that of water turning a mill. At Cobham, in Surrey,\r\nDunstall, in Suffolk, Earsy Court, in Berkshire, Eatonbridge, Kent, and\r\nmany other places, the waters were variously agitated.\r\n\r\nAt Eyam bridge, in Derbyshire Peak, the overseer of the lead mines,\r\nsitting in his writing-room, about eleven o’clock, felt a sudden shock,\r\nwhich very sensibly raised him up in his chair, and caused several\r\npieces of plaster to drop from the sides of the room. The roof was so\r\nviolently shaken, that he imagined the engine-shaft had been falling in.\r\nUpon this he immediately ran to see what was the matter, but found\r\neverything in perfect safety. At this time two miners were employed in\r\ncarting, or drawing along the drifts of the mines, the ore and other\r\nmaterials to be raised up at the shafts. The drift in which they were\r\nworking was about a hundred and twenty yards deep, and the space from\r\none end to the other fifty yards or upward. The miner at the end of the\r\ndrift had just loaded his cart, and was drawing it along; but he was\r\nsuddenly surprised by a shock, which so terrified him, that he\r\nimmediately quitted his employment, and ran to the west end of the drift\r\nto his partner, who was no less terrified than himself. They durst not\r\nattempt to climb the shaft, lest that should be running in upon them:\r\nbut while they were consulting what means they should take for their\r\nsafety, they were surprised by a second shock, more violent than the\r\nfirst; which frightened them so much, that they both ran precipitately\r\nto the other end of the drift. They then went down to another miner, who\r\nworked about twelve yards below them. He told them that the violence of\r\nthe second shock had been so great, that it caused the rocks to grind\r\nupon one another. His account was interrupted by a third shock, which,\r\nafter an interval of four or five minutes, was succeeded by a fourth,\r\nand, about the same space of time after, by a fifth; none of which were\r\nso violent as the second. They heard, after every shock, a loud rumbling\r\nin the bowels of the earth, which continued about half a minute,\r\ngradually descending, or seeming to remove to a greater distance.\r\n\r\nAt Shireburn Castle, Oxfordshire, a little after ten in the morning, a\r\nvery strange motion was observed in the water of a moat which\r\nencompassed the building. There was a pretty thick fog, not a breath of\r\nair, and the surface of the water all over the moat was smooth as a\r\nlooking-glass, except at one corner, where it flowed into the shore, and\r\nretired again successively, in a surprising manner. How it began to move\r\nis uncertain, as it was not then observed. The flux and reflux, when\r\nseen were quite regular. Every flood began gently, its velocity\r\nincreasing by degrees, until at length it rushed in with great\r\nimpetuosity, till it had attained its full hight. Having remained for a\r\nlittle time stationary, it then retired, ebbing gently at first, but\r\nafterward sinking away with great swiftness. At every flux the whole\r\nbody of water seemed to be violently thrown against the bank; but\r\nneither during the time of the flux, nor that of the reflux, did there\r\nappear even the least wrinkle of a wave on the other parts of the moat.\r\nLord Parker, who had observed this motion, being desirous to know\r\nwhether it was universal over the moat, sent a person to the other\r\ncorner of it, at the same time that he himself stood about twenty-five\r\nyards from him to examine whether the water moved there or not. He could\r\nnot perceive any motion there; but another person, who went to the\r\nnorth-east corner of the moat, diagonally opposite to his lordship,\r\nfound it as considerable there as where he was. His lordship imagining,\r\nthat in all probability the water at the corner diagonally opposite to\r\nwhere he was would sink as that by him rose, ordered the person to\r\nsignify by calling out, when the water by him began to sink, and when to\r\nrise. This he did; but to his lordship’s great surprise, immediately\r\nafter the water began to rise at his own end, he heard the voice calling\r\nthat it began to rise with him also; and in the same manner he heard\r\nthat it was sinking at that end, soon after he perceived it to sink by\r\nhimself. A pond just below was agitated in a similar manner; but the\r\nrisings and sinkings happened at different times from those at the pond\r\nwhere Lord Parker stood.\r\n\r\nAt White Rock, in Glamorganshire, about two hours’ ebb of tide, and near\r\na quarter to seven in the evening, a vast quantity of water rushed up\r\nwith a great noise, floated two large vessels, the least of them above\r\ntwo hundred tuns’ burden, broke their moorings, drove them across the\r\nriver, and nearly overset them. The whole rise and fall of this\r\nextraordinary body of water did not last above ten minutes, nor was it\r\nfelt in any other part of the river, so that it seemed to have gushed\r\nout of the earth at that place.\r\n\r\nSimilar instances occurred at Loch Lomond and Loch Ness, in Scotland. At\r\nKinsale, in Ireland, and all along the coast to the westward, many\r\nsimilar phenomena were observed.\r\n\r\nShocks were also perceived in several parts of France, as at Bayonne,\r\nBourdeaux and Lyons; and commotions of the waters were observed at\r\nAngoulesme, Belleville, Havre de Grace, &c., but not attended with the\r\nremarkable circumstances above mentioned.\r\n\r\nThese are the most striking phenomena with which the earthquake of the\r\nfirst of November, 1755, was attended on the surface of the earth. Those\r\nwhich happened below ground can not be known but by the changes observed\r\nin springs, &c., which were in many places very remarkable.\r\n\r\nAt Tangier, all the fountains were dried up, so that there was no water\r\nto be had till night. A very remarkable change was observed in the\r\nmedicinal waters of Toplitz, a village in Bohemia, famous for its baths.\r\nThese waters were discovered in the year 762; from which time the\r\nprincipal spring had constantly thrown out hot water in the same\r\nquantity, and of the same quality. On the morning of the earthquake,\r\nbetween eleven and twelve, in the forenoon, this principal spring cast\r\nforth such a quantity of water, that in the space of half an hour all\r\nthe baths ran over. About half an hour before this great increase of the\r\nwater, the spring flowed turbid and muddy; then, having stopped entirely\r\nfor a minute, it broke forth again with prodigious violence, driving\r\nbefore it a considerable quantity of reddish ocher. After this, it\r\nbecame clear, and flowed as pure as before. It still continued to do so,\r\nbut the water was in greater quantity, and hotter, than before the\r\nearthquake. At Angoulesme, in France, a subterraneous noise, resembling\r\nthunder, was heard; and presently after, the earth opened, and\r\ndischarged a torrent of water, mixed with red sand. Most of the springs\r\nin the neighborhood sunk in such a manner, that for some time they were\r\nthought to be quite dry. In Britain, no considerable alteration was\r\nobserved in the earth, except that, near the lead mine above-mentioned,\r\nin Derbyshire, a cleft was observed about a foot deep, six inches wide,\r\nand one hundred and fifty yards in length.\r\n\r\nAt sea the shocks of this earthquake were felt most violently. Off St.\r\nLucar, the captain of the Nancy frigate felt his ship so violently\r\nshaken, that he thought she had struck the ground; but, heaving the\r\nlead, he found she was in a great depth of water. Captain Clark, from\r\nDenia, in north latitude thirty-six degrees, twenty-four minutes,\r\nbetween nine and ten in the morning, had his ship shaken and strained as\r\nif she had struck upon a rock, so that the seams of the deck opened, and\r\nthe compass was overturned in the binnacle. Tho master of a vessel bound\r\nto the American islands, being in north latitude twenty-five degrees,\r\nwest longitude forty degrees, and writing in his cabin, heard a violent\r\nnoise as he imagined, in the steerage; and while he was asking what the\r\nmatter was, the ship was put into a strange agitation, and seemed as if\r\nshe had been suddenly jerked up, and suspended by a rope fastened to the\r\nmast-head. He immediately started up with great terror and astonishment,\r\nand looking out at the cabin-window, saw land, as he took it to be, at\r\nthe distance of about a mile. Coming upon the deck, the land was no more\r\nto be seen, but he perceived a violent current cross the ship’s way to\r\nthe leeward. In about a minute, this current returned with great\r\nimpetuosity; and at a league’s distance, he saw three craggy-pointed\r\nrocks throwing up waters of various colors, resembling fire. This\r\nphenomenon, in about two minutes, ended in a black cloud, which ascended\r\nvery heavily. After it had risen above the horizon, no rocks were to be\r\nseen; though the cloud, still ascending, was long visible, the weather\r\nbeing extremely clear. Between nine and ten in the morning, another\r\nship, forty leagues west of St. Vincent, was so strongly agitated, that\r\nthe anchors, which were lashed, bounced up, and the men were thrown a\r\nfoot and a half perpendicularly up from the deck. Immediately after\r\nthis, the ship sunk in the water as low as the main-chains. The lead\r\nshowed a great depth of water, and the line was tinged of a yellow\r\ncolor, and smelt of sulphur. The shock lasted about ten minutes; but\r\nthey felt smaller ones for the space of twenty-four hours.\r\n\r\n\r\n            EARTHQUAKES IN SICILY, AND IN THE TWO CALABRIAS.\r\n\r\nThese earthquakes began on the fifth of February, 1783, and continued\r\nuntil the latter end of the May following, doing infinite damage, and\r\nexhibiting at Messina, in the parts of Sicily nearest to the continent,\r\nand in the two Calabrias, a variety of phenomena. The part of the\r\nCalabrian provinces most affected by this heavy calamity, lies between\r\nthe thirty-eighth and thirty-ninth degrees of latitude, being the\r\nextreme point of the continent; and the greatest force of the\r\nearthquakes was exerted at the foot of the particular mountains of the\r\nApennines, named Monte Deio, Monte Sacro and Monte Caulone, extending\r\nwestward to the Tyrrhene sea. The towns, villages and farm-houses,\r\nnearest to these mountains, whether situated on the hills, or in the\r\nplains, were totally ruined by the first shock, which happened about\r\nnoon; and there the destruction of lives was the greatest. The towns\r\nstill more remote, were, however, greatly damaged by the subsequent\r\nshocks, particularly those of the seventh, twenty-sixth and\r\ntwenty-eighth of February, and that of the first of March. The earth was\r\nin a constant tremor, and its motions were various, being either\r\nvortical, horizontal or oscillatory, that is, by pulsations or beatings,\r\nfrom the bottom upward. This variety increased the apprehensions of the\r\nunfortunate inhabitants, who momentarily expected that the earth would\r\nopen beneath their feet, and swallow them up. The rains had been\r\ncontinual and violent, often accompanied by lightning and furious gusts\r\nof wind. There were many openings and cracks in the earth; and several\r\nhills had been lowered, while others were quite level. In the plains,\r\nthe chasms were so deep, that many roads were rendered impassable. Huge\r\nmountains were severed, and portions of them driven into the valleys,\r\nwhich were thus filled up. The course of several rivers was changed; and\r\nmany springs of water appeared in localities which had before been\r\nperfectly dry.\r\n\r\nFrom the city of Amantea, situated on the coast of the Tyrrhene sea, in\r\nlower Calabria, proceeding along the western coast to Cape Spartivento,\r\nin upper Calabria, and thence along the eastern coast to Cape Alice, a\r\npart of lower Calabria, on the Ionian sea, the towns and villages,\r\namounting to nearly four hundred, whether on the coast or inland, were\r\neither totally destroyed, or suffered greatly. At Casal Nuovo, the\r\nPrincess Gerace, and upward of four thousand of the inhabitants, lost\r\ntheir lives. At Bagnara, the number of dead amounted to upward of three\r\nthousand; and Radicina and Palmi experienced a similar loss. The total\r\namount of the mortality occasioned by these earthquakes, in Sicily and\r\nthe two Calabrias, was, agreeably to the official returns, thirty-two\r\nthousand, three hundred and sixty-seven; but Sir William Hamilton\r\nthought it still greater, and carries his estimate to forty thousand,\r\nincluding foreigners. On the first shock of the earthquake, on the fifth\r\nof February, the inhabitants of Scylla escaped from their houses, built\r\non the rock, and, following the example of their prince, took shelter on\r\nthe sea-shore. By this shock the sea had been raised and agitated so\r\nviolently, that much damage had been done on the point of the Faro of\r\nMessina; but here it acted with still greater violence, for, during the\r\nnight, an immense wave, which was falsely represented to have been\r\nboiling hot, and to have scalded many persons on its rising to a great\r\nhight, flowed furiously three miles inland, and swept off in its return\r\ntwo thousand, four hundred and seventy-three of the inhabitants, with\r\nthe prince at their head, who were either at that time on the strand, or\r\nin boats near the shore.\r\n\r\nThe shocks felt since the commencement of these formidable earthquakes,\r\namounted to several hundreds; and among the most violent may be reckoned\r\nthe one which happened on the twenty-eighth of March. It affected most\r\nof the higher part of upper Calabria, and the inferior part of lower\r\nCalabria, being equally tremendous with the first. Indeed, these shocks\r\nwere the only ones sensibly felt in Naples. With relation to the former,\r\ntwo singular phenomena are recorded. At the distance of about three\r\nmiles from the ruined city of Oppido, in upper Calabria, was a hill,\r\nhaving a sandy and clayey soil, nearly four hundred feet in hight, and\r\nnearly nine hundred feet in circumference at its basis. This hill is\r\nsaid to have been carried to the distance of about four miles from the\r\nspot where it stood, into a plain called _Campo di Bassano_. At the same\r\ntime, the hill on which the city of Oppido stood, and which extended\r\nabout three miles, divided into two parts: being situated between two\r\nrivers, its ruins filled up the valley, and stopped their course,\r\nforming two large lakes, which augmented daily. The accounts from Sicily\r\nwere of a most alarming nature. The greatest part of the fine city of\r\nMessina was destroyed by the shock of the fifth of February, and what\r\nremained was greatly injured by the subsequent shocks. The quay in the\r\nport had sunk considerably, and was in some places more than a foot\r\nbeneath the water. That superb building, the palazzata, which gave the\r\nport a more magnificent appearance than any other in Europe could boast,\r\nwas entirely thrown down; and the lazaretto greatly damaged. The citadel\r\nsuffered little; but the cathedral was destroyed, and the tower at the\r\npoint of the entrance of the harbor much damaged. The wave which had\r\ndone so much mischief at Scylla, had passed over the point of land at\r\nthe Faro, and swept away twenty-four persons. The accounts from Melazzo,\r\nPatti, Terra di Santa Lucia, Castro Reale, and from the island of\r\nLipari, were very distressing, but the damage done there by the\r\nearthquakes not so considerable as at Messina.\r\n\r\nSir William Hamilton, from the limited boundaries of these earthquakes,\r\nwas persuaded that they were caused by some great operation of nature,\r\nof a volcanic kind. To ascertain this, he began his tour by visiting the\r\nparts of the coasts of the two Calabrias which had suffered most from\r\nthis severe visitation. He everywhere came to ruined towns and houses,\r\nthe inhabitants of which were in sheds, many of them built on such\r\ninsalubrious spots, that an epidemic had ensued. These unfortunate\r\npeople agreed that every shock they had felt, seemed to come with a\r\nrumbling noise from the westward, beginning usually with the horizontal\r\nmotion, and ending with the vortical (or whirling) motion, which last\r\nhad ruined most of the buildings. It had also been generally observed,\r\nthat, before a shock, the clouds seemed to be fixed and motionless; and\r\nthat, after a heavy shower of rain, a shock quickly followed. By the\r\nviolence of some of the shocks, many persons had been thrown down; and\r\nseveral of the peasants described the motion of the earth as so violent,\r\nthat the tops of the largest trees almost touched the ground from side\r\nto side. During a shock, the oxen and horses, they said, kept their legs\r\nwide asunder, to prevent being thrown down, and gave evident signs of\r\nbeing sensible of the approach of each shock. Being thus warned, the\r\nneighing of a horse, the braying of an ass, or the cackling of a goose,\r\ndrove them from their temporary huts.\r\n\r\nFrom Monteleone, Sir William descended into the plain, and passed many\r\ntowns and villages in a ruined state: the city of Mileto, lying in a\r\nbottom, was totally destroyed, without a house standing. Among the many\r\nexamples afforded by these earthquakes, of animals being able to live a\r\nlong time without food, was that of two hogs, which had remained buried\r\nunder a heap of ruins at Soriano for forty-two days, and were dug out\r\nalive. He had frequent opportunities for observing that the habitations\r\nsituated on high grounds, having a soil of a gritty sandstone, somewhat\r\nlike granite, but without its consistence, suffered less than those in\r\nthe plain, the soil of which is a sandy clay. The latter were\r\nuniversally leveled with the ground. During the first shock, he was\r\ntold, a fountain of water, mixed with sand, had been forced to a\r\nconsiderable hight: prior to this phenomenon, the river was dry, but it\r\nsoon returned and overflowed its banks. The other rivers in the plain\r\nunderwent the like vicissitudes; to account for which, Sir William\r\nsupposes the first impulsion of the earthquake to have come from the\r\nbottom upward; and that such was the fact, the inhabitants attested. The\r\nsurface of the plain having suddenly risen, the rivers, which are not\r\ndeep, would naturally disappear; and the plain seeking with violence its\r\nformer level, the rivers would necessarily return and overflow, at the\r\nsame time that the sudden depression of the boggy grounds would as\r\nnaturally force out the water which lay hidden beneath the surface.\r\n\r\nIt had been stated, in the reports made to the government, that two\r\ntenements, named Macini and Vaticano, had, by the effect of the\r\nearthquake, changed their situation. In this fact Sir William agrees,\r\nand he accounts for it in the following manner. They were situated in a\r\nvalley surrounded by high grounds, and the surface of the earth which\r\nhad been removed, had probably been long undermined by the little\r\nrivulets which flow from the mountains, and which were in full view on\r\nthe bare spot the tenements had deserted. He conjectures besides, that,\r\nthe earthquake having opened some depositions of rain-water in the\r\nclayey hills which surrounded the valley, the water, mixing with the\r\nloose soil, and taking its course suddenly through the undermined\r\nsurface, had lifted it up, together with the large olive and mulberry\r\ntrees, and a thatched cottage, floating the entire piece of ground, with\r\nall its vegetation, about a mile down the valley, where he saw it, with\r\nmost of the trees erect. These two tenements occupied a space of ground\r\nabout a mile in length, and half a mile in breadth. There were in the\r\nvicinity several deep cracks in the earth, not one of which was then\r\nmore than a foot in breadth; but Sir William was credibly assured, that,\r\nduring the earthquake, one had opened wide, and had swallowed up an ox\r\nand nearly a hundred goats. In this valley he saw hollows, in the form\r\nof inverted cones, from which water and sand had been ejected violently\r\nat the time of the earthquakes, similar to those which had been pointed\r\nout to him at Rosarno. As well at the latter place, as in every ruined\r\ntown he visited, an interesting remark was made to him, namely, that the\r\nmale dead were generally found under the ruins, in the attitude of\r\nstruggling against the danger; but that the attitude of the females was\r\nusually with the hands clasped over the head, as if giving themselves up\r\nto despair, unless they had children near them: in this case they were\r\nalways found clasping them in their arms, or in some attitude which\r\nindicated their anxious care to protect them. How striking an instance\r\nof maternal tenderness!\r\n\r\nSir William traveled four days in the plain, in the midst of\r\nindescribable misery. Such was the force of the first shock, on the\r\nfifth of February, that the inhabitants of the towns were buried in an\r\ninstant beneath the ruins of their houses. Of the population of the town\r\nof Polistene, which was badly situated between two rivers, wont to\r\noverflow their banks, twenty-one hundred individuals perished out of six\r\nthousand. It was built near a ravine of great depth; and, by the violent\r\nmotion of the earth, two huge portions of the ground on which a\r\nconsiderable part of the town, consisting of several hundreds of houses,\r\nstood, were detached into the ravine, and nearly across it, to the\r\ndistance of about half a mile from their original position. What was\r\nmost extraordinary, many of the inhabitants of these houses, who had\r\ntaken this singular leap in them, were dug out alive, and several\r\nunhurt. Terra Nuova lost three-fourths of a population of sixteen\r\nhundred inhabitants; and near to this town and to the ravine, many acres\r\nof land covered with trees and corn-fields had been detached and thrown\r\ninto the latter, often without having been overturned, insomuch that the\r\ntrees and crops were growing as well as if they had been planted there.\r\nOther such pieces of ground were lying in the bottom, in an inclined\r\nsituation; and others, again, were quite overturned. Two immense\r\nportions of land, having been detached opposite to each other, filled\r\nthe valley, and stopped the course of the river, the waters of which\r\nformed a great lake.\r\n\r\nHaving walked over the ruins of Oppido, Sir William descended into the\r\nravine, which he carefully examined. Here he saw the wonderful force of\r\nthe earthquake, which had produced exactly the same effects as in the\r\nravine of Terra Nuova, but on a scale infinitely greater. The enormous\r\nmasses of the plain, detached from each side of the ravine, lay in\r\nconfused heaps, forming real mountains; and, having stopped the course\r\nof two rivers, great lakes were formed. He occasionally met with a\r\ndetached piece of the surface of the plain, many acres in extent, with\r\nthe large oaks and olive-trees, having lupines and corn beneath them,\r\ngrowing as well, and in as good order at the bottom of the ravine, as\r\ntheir companions from which they had been separated, were in the plain,\r\nat least five hundred feet higher, and at the distance of about\r\nthree-quarters of a mile. Entire vineyards, which had taken a similar\r\njourney, were in the same order in the bottom. In another part of the\r\nravine was a mountain, composed of a clayey soil, which was probably a\r\nportion of the plain, detached by an earthquake at some former period:\r\nit was in hight about two hundred and fifty feet, and about four hundred\r\nfeet in diameter at its basis. It was well attested, Sir William\r\nobserves, that this mountain traveled down the ravine nearly four miles,\r\nhaving been put in motion by the first shock. The abundance of rain\r\nwhich fell at that time; the great weight of the newly detached pieces\r\nof the plain, which were heaped up at its back; the nature of its soil;\r\nand particularly its situation on a declivity: these, in his opinion,\r\nsatisfactorily account for this phenomenon. The Prince of Cariati showed\r\nhim two girls, one of the age of about sixteen years, who had remained\r\neleven days without food under the ruins of a house in Oppido; and the\r\nother, about eleven years of age, who had been under the same\r\ncircumstances six days, but in a very confined and distressing posture.\r\n\r\nSir William describes the port of Messina, and the town, in their\r\nhalf-ruined state, when viewed by moonlight, as strikingly picturesque.\r\nOn landing, he was assured by several fishermen, that, during the\r\nearthquake of the fifth of February, at night the sand near the sea was\r\nhot, and that in many parts they saw fire issue from the earth. This had\r\nbeen often repeated to him in the Calabrian plain; and the idea he\r\nentertained was, that the exhalations which issued during the violent\r\ncommotions of the earth, were full of electric fire, just as the smoke\r\nof volcanoes is constantly observed to be during violent eruptions; for\r\nhe did not, during any part of his tour, perceive an indication of\r\nvolcanic matter having issued from the fissures of the earth. He was,\r\ntherefore, convinced that the whole damage had been done by exhalations\r\nand vapors only. In this city, where they had so long an experience of\r\nearthquakes, he was told, that all animals and birds are, in a greater\r\nor less degree, more sensible of an approaching shock of an earthquake\r\nthan any human being; but that geese, above all, were the soonest and\r\nthe most alarmed at the approach of a shock: if in the water, they quit\r\nit immediately, and they can not be driven into it for some time after.\r\n\r\nThe force of the earthquakes, although very violent at Messina, and at\r\nReggio, on the opposite side of the strait, was not to be compared to\r\nthat which was felt in the plain. In the former city the mortality did\r\nnot exceed seven hundred, of a population of thirty thousand. A curious\r\ncircumstance happened there also, to prove that animals can sustain life\r\nfor a long time without food. Two mules belonging to the Duke of\r\nBelviso, remained under a heap of ruins, the one twenty-two, and the\r\nother twenty-three days: for some days after they refused their food,\r\nbut drank plentifully, and finally recovered. There were numberless\r\ninstances of dogs remaining many days in the same situation; and a hen,\r\nbelonging to the British vice-consul, having been closely shut up\r\nbeneath the ruins of his house, was taken out on the twenty-second day,\r\nand recovered, although at first it showed but little signs of life:\r\nlike the mules, it did not eat for some days, but drank freely. From\r\nthese instances, and from those above related, of the girls at Oppido,\r\nand the hogs at Soriano, as well as from several others of the same\r\nkind, it may be concluded, that long fasting is always attended with\r\ngreat thirst, and a total loss of appetite.\r\n\r\nA circumstance worth recording, and which was observed throughout the\r\nwhole coast of the part of the Calabrian provinces which had been most\r\naffected by the earthquakes, was, that a description of small fishes,\r\nnamed =cicirelli=, resembling what in England are called white-bait, but\r\nlarger, and which usually lie at the bottom of the sea, buried in the\r\nsand, were, from the commencement of these earthquakes, and for a\r\nconsiderable time after, taken near the surface, and in such abundance\r\nas to become the common food of the poorer sort of people; whereas,\r\nbefore these events, they were rare, and reckoned among the greatest\r\ndelicacies. Fishes in general having been taken, wherever the effects of\r\nthe shocks had reached, in much greater abundance, and with greater\r\nfacility than before, Sir William conjectures, either that the bottom of\r\nthe sea may have been heated by the volcanic fire beneath it, or that\r\nthe continual tremor of the earth had driven the fishes out of their\r\nstrongholds, in the same way as an angler, when he wants a bait, obliges\r\nthe worms to come out of a turf on the river-side, by trampling on it\r\nwith his feet, which motion never fails of its effect.\r\n\r\nThe commandant of the citadel of Messina, assured him, that on the fatal\r\nfifth of February, and the three following days, the sea, at the\r\ndistance of about a quarter of a mile from that fortress, rose and\r\nboiled in a most extraordinary manner, and with a horrid and alarming\r\nnoise, while the water in the other parts of the Faro was perfectly\r\ncalm. This appeared to him to point out exhalations or eruptions from\r\ncracks at the bottom of the sea, which were probably made during the\r\nviolence of the earthquakes; and to these phenomena he ascribes a\r\nvolcanic origin. He thus attempts to explain the nature of the\r\nformidable wave which was represented as boiling hot, and which, as has\r\nbeen already noticed, was so fatal to the inhabitants of Scylla.\r\n\r\nSir William concludes by remarking, that the local earthquakes here\r\ndescribed, appear to have been caused by the same kind of matter as that\r\nwhich gave birth to the Æolian or Lipari isles. He conjectures that an\r\nopening may have been made at the bottom of the sea, most probably\r\nbetween Stromboli and upper Calabria; for from that quarter, it was\r\nagreed by all, the subterraneous noises seemed to proceed. He adds, that\r\nthe foundation of a new island, or volcano, may have been laid, although\r\nit may be ages, which to nature are but moments, before it shall be\r\ncompleted, and appear above the surface of the sea. Nature is ever\r\nactive; but her acts are in general carried on so very slowly, as\r\nscarcely to be perceptible to the mortal view, or recorded in the very\r\nshort space of what we call history, let it be ever so ancient. It is\r\nprobable, also, he observes, that the whole of the destruction he has\r\ndescribed, may have simply proceeded from the exhalations of confined\r\nvapors, generated by the fermentation of such minerals as produce\r\nvolcanoes, which would escape where they met with the least resistance,\r\nand would consequently affect the plain in a greater degree than the\r\nhigh and more solid grounds by which it is surrounded.\r\n\r\nCount Francesco Ippolito, in speaking of the last great shock of the\r\ntwenty-eighth of March, as it affected the Calabrian territory, is\r\npersuaded that it arose from an internal fire in the bowels of the\r\nearth, for it took place precisely in the mountains which cross the neck\r\nof the peninsula formed by the two rivers, the Lameto and the Corace,\r\nthe former of which flows into the gulf of St. Euphemia, and the latter\r\ninto the Ionian sea. All the phenomena it displayed, made this evident.\r\nLike the other shocks, it came in a south-west direction: the earth at\r\nfirst undulated, then shook, and finally rocked to and fro to such a\r\ndegree, that it was scarcely possible to stand. It was preceded by a\r\nterrible groan from beneath the ground; and this groan, which was of the\r\nsame duration with the shock, terminated with a loud noise, like that of\r\nthe explosion of a mine. These thunderings accompanied not only the\r\nshock of that night, and of the succeeding day, but likewise all the\r\nothers which were afterward felt; at the same time that the earth was\r\ncontinually shaken, at first every five minutes, and subsequently each\r\nquarter of an hour. During the night, flames were seen to issue from the\r\nground in the neighborhood of Reggio, toward the sea, to which the\r\nexplosion extended, insomuch that many of the peasants ran away through\r\nfear. These flames issued precisely from a spot where some days before\r\nan extraordinary heat had been perceived. After this great shock there\r\nappeared in the air, in a slanting direction, and toward the cast, a\r\nwhitish flame, resembling electric fire: it was seen for the space of\r\ntwo hours.\r\n\r\nSeveral hills were either divided or laid level; and within the surface\r\nof the earth apertures were made, from which a great quantity of water,\r\nproceeding either from subterraneous concentrations, or from the rivers\r\nadjacent to the ground thus broken up, spouted for several hours. From\r\none of these openings, in the territory of Borgia, and about a mile from\r\nthe sea, there issued a large quantity of salt water, which for several\r\ndays imitated the motions of the sea. Warm water likewise issued from\r\nthe apertures made in the plains of Maida. In all the sandy parts, where\r\nthe explosion took place, there were observed, from distance to\r\ndistance, apertures in the form of an inverted cone, emitting water, and\r\nwhich seemed to prove the escape of a flake of electric fire. Amid the\r\nvarious phenomena which either preceded or followed this particular\r\nshock, the following are well deserving of notice. The water of a well\r\nat Maida, which was of an excellent quality, was affected, just before\r\nthe shock, with so disgusting a sulphurous flavor, that it could not\r\neven be smelled. On the other hand, at Catanzaro, the water of a well,\r\nwhich before could not be used, on account of its possessing a strong\r\nsmell of calcination, became drinkable. For a long time before the earth\r\nshook, the sea was considerably agitated, so as to terrify the\r\nfishermen, at the same time that there was not a breath of wind. On the\r\nside of Italy, the volcanoes had not emitted any eruptions for a\r\nconsiderable time before; but in the same way as, during the first great\r\nshock, Etna was in flames, so Stromboli emitted fire during this last.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        EARTHQUAKES IN PERU, &c.\r\n\r\nSouth America has been at all times very subject to earthquakes; and it\r\nis remarkable, that the city of Lima, the capital of Peru, situated in\r\nabout twelve degrees of south latitude, although scarcely ever visited\r\nby tempests, and equally unacquainted with rain as with thunder and\r\nlightning, has been singularly exposed to their fury. They, indeed,\r\nhappen so frequently there, that the inhabitants are under continual\r\napprehensions of being, from their suddenness and violence, buried\r\nbeneath the ruins of their houses. Still they have their presages, one\r\nof the principal of which is a rumbling noise in the bowels of the\r\nearth, heard about a minute before the shocks are felt, and seeming to\r\npervade all the subterraneous adjacent parts. This is followed by the\r\ndismal howlings of the dogs, who seem to give notice of the approaching\r\ndanger; while the beasts of burden, in their passage through the\r\nstreets, stop suddenly, as it were by a natural instinct, and seek the\r\nattitude which may best secure them from falling. On these portents, the\r\nterrified inhabitants flee from their houses into the streets, forming\r\nlarge assemblies, in the midst of which cries of children are blended\r\nwith the lamentations of the females, whose agonizing prayers to the\r\nsaints increase the common fear and confusion. In a word, the entire\r\ncity exhibits a dreadful scene of consternation and horror.\r\n\r\nSince the establishment of the Spaniards in Peru, the first earthquake\r\nin this capital happened in 1582; but the damage it did was much less\r\nconsiderable than that of some of those which succeeded. Six years after\r\nLima was again visited by an earthquake, the results of which were so\r\ndreadful, that it is still solemnly commemorated every year. In 1609, a\r\nthird convulsion threw down many houses: and on the twenty-seventh of\r\nNovember, 1630, so much damage was done by an earthquake, that in\r\nacknowledgment of the city not having been entirely demolished, a\r\nfestival is also on that day annually celebrated. On the third of\r\nNovember, 1654, the most stately edifices in Lima, and a great number of\r\nhouses, were destroyed by a similar event; but the inhabitants having\r\nhad timely presages, withdrew themselves from their houses, insomuch\r\nthat few perished. In 1678, another dreadful concussion took place.\r\n\r\nAmong the most tremendous earthquakes with which the Peruvian capital\r\nhas been visited, may be reckoned that which happened on the\r\ntwenty-eighth of October, 1687. The first shock was at four in the\r\nmorning, when several of the finest public buildings and houses were\r\ndestroyed, with the loss of many lives. This was, however, merely a\r\nprelude to what followed; for, two hours after, a second shock was felt,\r\nwith such impetuous concussions, that all was laid in ruins, and every\r\ndescription of property lost. During this second shock the sea retired\r\nconsiderably, and then returned in mountainous waves, entirely\r\noverwhelming Callao, the seaport of Lima, distant five miles, as well as\r\nthe adjacent country, together with the wretched inhabitants. From that\r\ntime six other earthquakes were felt at Lima, prior to that of 1746,\r\nwhich likewise happened on the twenty-eighth of October, at half past\r\nten at night. The early concussions were so violent, that in somewhat\r\nmore than three minutes, the greater part (if not all) of the buildings\r\nin the city, were destroyed, burying under their ruins such of the\r\ninhabitants as had not made sufficient haste into the streets and\r\nsquares, the only places of safety. At length the horrible effects of\r\nthe first shock ceased; but the tranquillity was of short duration, the\r\nconcussions swiftly succeeding each other. The fort of Callao was\r\ndilapidated; but what this building suffered from the earthquake, was\r\ninconsiderable when compared with the dreadful catastrophe which\r\nfollowed. The sea, as is usual on such occasions, receding to a\r\nconsiderable distance, returned in mountainous waves, foaming with the\r\nviolence of the agitation, and suddenly buried Callao and the\r\nneighboring country in its flood. This, however, was not entirely\r\neffected by the first swell of the waves; for the sea, retiring still\r\nfurther, returned with greater impetuosity, and covered not only the\r\nbuildings, but also the lofty walls of the fortress: so that what had\r\neven escaped the first inundation, was totally overwhelmed by these\r\nsucceeding mountainous waves. Of twenty-three ships and vessels of light\r\nburden, then in the harbor, nineteen were sunk; and the four others,\r\namong which was a frigate, named the San Firmin, were carried by the\r\nforce of the waves to a considerable distance up the country. This\r\nterrible inundation extended, as well as the earthquake, to other parts\r\nof the coast, and several towns underwent the fate of Lima. The number\r\nof persons who perished in that capital, within two days after the\r\nearthquake commenced, on an estimate of the bodies found, amounted to\r\nthirteen hundred, beside the wounded and maimed, many of whom survived\r\ntheir tortures but a short time.\r\n\r\nThe earthquake of Jamaica, in 1692, was one of the most dreadful history\r\nhas had to record. In the space of two minutes it destroyed the town of\r\nPort Royal, and sunk the houses in a gulf forty fathoms deep. It was\r\nattended with a hollow, rumbling noise, like that of thunder. In less\r\nthan a minute, the greater part of the houses, on one side of the\r\nstreets, were, with their inhabitants, sunk beneath the water, while\r\nthose on the other side were thrown into heaps, the sandy soil on which\r\nthey were built rising like the waves of the sea, and suddenly\r\noverthrowing them on its subsidence. The water of the wells was\r\ndischarged with a most vehement agitation; and the sea was equally\r\nturbulent, bursting its mounds, and deluging whatever came in its way.\r\nThe fissures in the earth were in some places so great, that one of the\r\nstreets appeared of more than twice its original breadth. In many places\r\nthe earth opened and closed again; and this agitation continued for a\r\nconsiderable time. Several hundreds of these openings were to be seen at\r\nthe same moment: in some of them the wretched inhabitants were swallowed\r\nup; while in others, the earth suddenly closing, caught them by the\r\nmiddle, and thus crushed them to death. Other openings, still more\r\ndreadful, swallowed up entire streets; while others, again, spouted up\r\ncataracts of water, drowning those whom the earthquake had spared. The\r\nwhole was attended with a most noisome stench. The thunderings of the\r\ndistant falling mountains, the sky overcast with a dusky gloom, and the\r\ncrash of the falling buildings, gave unspeakable horror to the scene.\r\nThis dreadful calamity having ceased, the whole island exhibited a scene\r\nof desolation. Few of the houses which had not been swallowed up were\r\nleft standing; and whatever grew on the plantations shared in the\r\nuniversal ruin. These cultivated spots were now converted into large\r\npools of water, which when dried up by the sun, left so many plains of\r\nbarren sand. The greater part of the rivers had, during the earthquake,\r\nbeen choked by the falling in of the detached masses of mountains; and\r\nit was not until some time after, that they made themselves new\r\nchannels. The mountains seem to have been more particularly exposed to\r\nthe force of the first tremendous shock; and it was conjectured that the\r\nprincipal seat of the concussion was among them. Such of the inhabitants\r\nas were saved, sought shelter on board the ships in the harbor, and\r\nremained there above two months, the shocks continuing during that\r\ninterval with more or less violence every day.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        EARTHQUAKE IN VENEZUELA.\r\n\r\nOn the twenty-sixth of March, 1812, between four and five in the\r\nafternoon, Venezuela was visited by one of those tremendous earthquakes\r\nwhich now and then ruin whole provinces. During a minute and fifteen\r\nseconds the earth was convulsed in every direction, and nearly twenty\r\nthousand persons fell victims. The towns of Caraccas, La Guayra,\r\nMayquetia, Merida and San Felipe, were totally destroyed. Barquisimeto,\r\nValencia, La Vittoria, and others, suffered considerably. This\r\ncatastrophe happened on Holy Thursday, a day when the Romish church\r\npeculiarly commemorates the sufferings of our blessed Redeemer, and at\r\nthe very hour when the people were crowding into the churches to attend\r\nthe processions which are usual in Roman Catholic countries, and to see\r\nthe representation of our Saviour led to the cross. Troops are placed on\r\nsuch occasions at the entrance of the churches to follow the procession;\r\nand many churches, and the principal barracks at Caraccas, being thrown\r\ndown, there was a considerable number of soldiers killed, and many\r\nthousand persons crushed under their ruins. The arms and ammunition\r\ndestined for the defense of the country were buried in a similar manner;\r\nand what was worse, an unconquerable enemy to the independence of\r\nVenezuela seemed to raise its head from among the ruins—that religious\r\nprejudice which the earthquake inspired. In an era less remarkable, a\r\nmere convulsion of nature would have had no influence on a new\r\ngovernment; but, notwithstanding the prosperity Venezuela then enjoyed,\r\nthe seeds of discontent had fallen on one class of the community. The\r\nprinciples which formed the basis of the new constitution were\r\ndemocratical, and it had been necessary to deprive the priesthood of\r\nsome of their privileges, which of course created enmity in their minds\r\nto the present government. Immediately after the earthquake, the priests\r\nproclaimed, that the Almighty condemned the revolution: they denounced\r\nhis wrath on all who favored it; and a counter-revolution, attended by\r\ngreat bloodshed, was the unhappy consequence.\r\n\r\n\r\n              -------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n               CONNECTION OF EARTHQUAKES WITH VOLCANOES.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  ------------------------------------\r\n\r\n                            ISLAND OF JAVA.\r\n\r\nThe connection of earthquakes with volcanoes has been already noticed;\r\nand a remarkable occurrence of this nature happened in Java. Papandayang\r\nwas formerly one of the largest volcanoes in that island; but in the\r\nmonth of August, 1772, the greatest part of it was, after a short but\r\nsevere combustion, swallowed up by a dreadful convulsion of the earth.\r\nThis event was preceded by an uncommonly luminous cloud, attended with\r\nflashes of light, by which the mountain was completely enveloped, and\r\nwhich so terrified the inhabitants dwelling at the foot and on its\r\ndeclivities, that they betook themselves to flight. Before they could\r\nall save themselves, however, the mountain began to give way, and the\r\ngreater part of it actually _fell in_ and disappeared in the earth. At\r\nthe same time, a tremendous noise was heard, resembling the discharge of\r\nthe heaviest cannon; while the immense quantities of volcanic substances\r\nwhich were thrown out, and spread in every direction, extended the\r\neffects of the explosion through the space of many miles.\r\n\r\nIt was estimated that an extent of ground, belonging to the mountain\r\nitself, and to its immediate environs, fifteen miles in length, and six\r\nin breadth, was by this commotion swallowed up in the bowels of the\r\nearth. Six weeks after the catastrophe, persons who were sent to examine\r\nthe condition of the surrounding territory, reported, that it was\r\nimpossible to approach the mountain, on account of the heat of the\r\nsubstances which covered its circumference, and which were piled on each\r\nother to the hight of three feet. It has been reported, that forty\r\nvillages, partly swallowed up by the opening of the earth, and partly\r\ncovered by the substances ejected, were destroyed on this melancholy\r\noccasion, with the loss of nearly three thousand lives. A proportionate\r\nnumber of cattle was destroyed; and the greater part of the plantations\r\nof cotton, indigo and coffee, in the adjacent districts, were buried\r\nbeneath the volcanic matter. The effects of this explosion were long\r\napparent on the remains of the volcanic mountain.\r\n\r\nWe here introduce a sketch of several curious and novel details of\r\nvolcanic phenomena in Java, on account of their intimate connection with\r\nthe subterraneous operations of nature in the production of earthquakes.\r\nIt may be considered as supplementary to the detailed account of\r\nvolcanoes given at the beginning of this work.\r\n\r\nThere are in Java thirty-eight large mountains, which, although they\r\ndiffer from each other in external figure, agree in the general\r\nattribute of volcanoes, by their having a broad base, which gradually\r\nverges toward the summit, in the form of a cone. One of these is named\r\nTankuban-Prahu, on account of its resembling, at a distance, a boat\r\nturned upside down: it forms a vast truncated cone. Its base extends to\r\na considerable distance, and it is not only one of the largest mountains\r\nin the island, but a most interesting volcano. Although it has not for\r\nmany ages had any violent eruption, as is evident from the progress of\r\nvegetation, and from the depth of black mold which covers its sides, its\r\ninterior has continued in a state of uninterrupted activity. Its crater\r\nis large, and has, in general, the shape of a funnel, but with its sides\r\nvery irregular: the brim, or margin, which bounds it at the top, has\r\nalso different degrees of elevation, rising and descending along the\r\nwhole course of its circumference. This may be estimated at a mile and a\r\nhalf; and the perpendicular depth on the south side, where it is very\r\nsteep, is at least two hundred and fifty feet: toward the west it rises\r\nconsiderably higher. The bottom of the crater has a diameter of nine\r\nhundred feet, but is not regular in its form, which depends on the\r\nmeeting of the sides below.\r\n\r\nNear the center it contains an irregular oval lake, or collection of\r\nwater, the greatest diameter of which is nearly three hundred feet. The\r\nwater being white, it exhibits the appearance of a lake of milk, boiling\r\nwith a perpetual discharge of large bubbles, occasioned by the\r\ndevelopment of fixed air. Toward its eastern extremity are the remaining\r\noutlets of the subterraneous fires, consisting of several apertures,\r\nfrom which an uninterrupted discharge of sulphurous vapors takes place.\r\nThese vapors rush out with an incredible force, with violent\r\nsubterraneous noises, resembling the boiling of an immense caldron in\r\nthe bowels of the mountain. When at the bottom, the force of the\r\nimpression made on the spectator by this grand and terrific scene, is\r\nincreased by the recollection of the dangers he had to encounter in the\r\ndescent; while the extent of the crater, and the remains of the former\r\nexplosions, afford an indescribable enjoyment, and fill his mind with\r\nthe most awful satisfaction.\r\n\r\nThe explosions of mud, called by the natives _bledeg_, are, as we have\r\nalready seen, a great curiosity. This volcanic phenomenon is in the\r\ncenter of a limestone district, and is first discovered, on approaching\r\nit from a distance, by a large volume of smoke, which rises and\r\ndisappears at intervals of a few seconds, and resembles the vapors\r\narising from a violent surf. A dull noise, like that of thunder, is at\r\nthe same time heard; and on a nearer approach, when the vision is no\r\nlonger impeded by the smoke, a large hemispherical mass is observed,\r\nconsisting of black earth, mixed with water, about sixteen feet in\r\ndiameter, rising up to the hight of twenty or thirty feet in a perfectly\r\nregular manner, and, as it were, pushed up by a force beneath. This mass\r\nsuddenly explodes with a dull noise, and scatters, in every direction, a\r\nvolume of black mud. After an interval of a few seconds, the\r\nhemispherical body of earth or mud again rises and explodes. In the same\r\nmanner this volcanic ebullition goes on without interruption, throwing\r\nup a globular body of mud, and dispersing it with violence through the\r\nneighboring plain. The spot where the ebullition occurs is nearly\r\ncircular, and perfectly level, and is entirely covered with the earthy\r\nparticles, impregnated with salt water, which are thrown up from below.\r\nThe circumference may be estimated at about half a mile. In order to\r\nconduct the salt water to the circumference, small passages, or gutters,\r\nare made in the loose muddy earth, which lead it to the borders, where\r\nit is collected in holes, or salt wells, dug in the ground, for the\r\npurpose of evaporation. The mud recently thrown up, possesses a degree\r\nof heat greater than that of the surrounding atmosphere, and emits a\r\nstrong, pungent and sulphurous smell. This volcanic phenomenon is\r\nsituated near the center of the large plain which interrupts the series\r\nof the more considerable volcanoes, and owes its origin to the general\r\ncause of the numerous volcanic eruptions which occur in the island of\r\nJava.\r\n\r\nThe tremendous violence with which nature marks the operations of\r\nvolcanoes in these regions, will be best exemplified by the following\r\ndetails of the extraordinary and wide-spreading phenomena which\r\naccompanied the eruption of the Tomboro mountain, in the island of\r\nSumbawa, one of the Javanese cluster. This eruption, which happened in\r\nApril, 1815, was sensibly felt over the whole of the Molucca islands,\r\nover Java, and over a considerable portion of Celebes, Sumatra and\r\nBorneo, to a circumference of a thousand statute miles from its center,\r\nby _tremulous motions_ and _loud explosions_; while, within the range of\r\nits more immediate activity, embracing a space of three hundred miles\r\naround it, it produced the most astonishing effects and excited the most\r\nalarming apprehensions. On Java, at the distance of three hundred miles,\r\nit seemed to be awfully present. The sky was overcast at noonday with a\r\ncloud of ashes; the sun was enveloped in an atmosphere, the palpable\r\ndensity of which it was unable to penetrate; showers of ashes covered\r\nthe houses, the streets and the fields, to the depth of several inches;\r\nand, amid this darkness, explosions were heard at intervals, like the\r\nreport of artillery, or the noise of distant thunder. Every one\r\nconceived, that the effects experienced might be caused by eruptions of\r\nsome of the numerous volcanoes on the island; but no one could have\r\nconjectured, that the shower of ashes which darkened the air, and\r\ncovered the ground of the eastern district of Java, could have proceeded\r\nfrom a mountain in Sumbawa, at the distance of several hundred miles.\r\n\r\nThe first explosions were heard at Java, on the evening of the fifth of\r\nApril, and continued until the following day, when the sun became\r\nobscured, and appeared to be enveloped in a fog. The weather was sultry;\r\nthe atmosphere close; and the pressure of the latter, added to the\r\ngeneral stillness, seemed to forebode an earthquake. This lasted for\r\nseveral days, the explosions continuing, but not with so much violence\r\nas at first. On the evening of the tenth, the eruptions, however, were\r\nmore loud and more frequent; ashes fell in abundance; the sun was nearly\r\nobscured; and in several parts of the island a _tremulous motion of the\r\nearth_ was felt. On the following day, the explosions were so tremendous\r\nas to shake the houses perceptibly in the more eastern districts.\r\n\r\nIn the island of Sumbawa itself, there was a great loss of lives, and\r\nthe surviving inhabitants were reduced to extreme misery. It appears\r\nfrom the account of the rajah, who was a spectator of the eruption, that\r\non the evening of the tenth of April, three distinct columns of flame,\r\nall apparently within the verge of the crater of the Tomboro mountain,\r\nburst forth, and, after ascending separately to a very great hight,\r\nunited their tops in the air. The whole of the mountain now appeared\r\nlike a body of liquid fire, extending itself in every direction. Stones\r\nand ashes were precipitated; and a whirlwind ensued, which blew down the\r\ngreater part of the houses in an adjoining village. It tore up by the\r\nroots the largest trees, and carried them into the air, together with\r\nmen, horses, cattle, and whatever came within its influence. The sea\r\nrose nearly twelve feet higher than usual, a phenomenon commonly\r\nattendant on earthquakes, overwhelming the plantations of rice, and\r\nsweeping away houses, with whatever came within its reach. It is\r\ncalculated that full twelve thousand individuals perished. The trees and\r\nherbage of every description, along the whole of the north and west\r\nsides of the peninsula, were completely destroyed, with the exception of\r\na high point of land near the spot where the village of Tomboro stood.\r\n\r\nThe extreme misery to which the inhabitants of the western part of the\r\nisland were reduced, was dreadful to behold. The roads were strewed with\r\ndead bodies; the villages were almost entirely deserted, and the houses\r\nfallen down. The peasants wandered in all directions in search of food;\r\nand the famine became so severe, that one of the daughters of the rajah\r\ndied of hunger. To judge of the violence of the eruption, it will\r\nsuffice to state, that the cloud of ashes which had been carried with so\r\nmuch celerity as to produce utter darkness, extended, in the direction\r\nof the island of Celebes, two hundred and seventeen nautical miles from\r\nthe seat of the volcano; and, in a direct line toward Java, upward of\r\nthree hundred geographical miles.\r\n\r\n\r\n              -------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n                      BASALTIC AND ROCKY WONDERS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  ------------------------------------\r\n\r\n                         THE GIANT’S CAUSEWAY.\r\n\r\nThis vast collection of basaltic pillars is in the vicinity of\r\nBallimony, in the county of Antrim, Ireland. The principal, or grand\r\ncauseway, (there being several less considerable and scattered fragments\r\nof a similar nature,) consists of an irregular arrangement of many\r\nhundred thousands of columns, formed of a black rock, nearly as hard as\r\nmarble. The greater part of them are of a pentagonal figure, but so\r\nclosely and compactly situated on their sides, though perfectly distinct\r\nfrom top to bottom, that scarcely anything can be introduced between\r\nthem. These columns are of an unequal hight and breadth: several of the\r\nmost elevated, visible above the surface of the strand, and at the foot\r\nof the impending angular precipice, are of the hight of about twenty\r\nfeet, which they do not exceed, at least not any of the principal\r\narrangement. How deeply they are fixed in the strand, has never yet been\r\nascertained.\r\n\r\nThis grand arrangement extends nearly two hundred yards, as it is\r\nvisible at low water; but how far beyond is uncertain: from its\r\ndeclining appearance, however, at low water, it is probable that it does\r\nnot reach beneath the water as far as it is seen above. The breadth of\r\nthe principal causeway, which runs out in one continued range of\r\ncolumns, is in general from twenty to thirty feet: in some parts it may,\r\nfor a short distance, be nearly forty. From this account are excluded\r\nthe broken and scattered pieces of the same kind of construction, which\r\nare detached from the sides of the grand causeway, as they do not appear\r\nto have ever been contiguous to the principal arrangement, although they\r\nhave been frequently comprehended in the width, which has led to such\r\nwild and dissimilar representations of this causeway, in the different\r\naccounts that have been given. Its highest part is the narrowest, at the\r\nvery spot of the impending cliff, whence the whole projects; and there,\r\nfor about the same space in length, its width is not more than from\r\ntwelve to fifteen feet. The columns of this narrow part incline from a\r\nperpendicular a little to the westward, and form a slope on their tops,\r\nby the unequal hight of their sides; and in this way a gradual ascent is\r\nmade at the foot of the cliff, from the head of one column to the next\r\nabove, to the top of the great causeway, which, at the distance of about\r\neighteen feet from the cliff, obtains a perpendicular position, and\r\nlowering from its general hight, widens to between twenty and thirty\r\nfeet, being for nearly three hundred feet always above the water. The\r\ntops of the columns being, throughout this length, nearly of an equal\r\nhight, form a grand and singular parade, which may be walked on,\r\nsomewhat inclining to the water’s edge. But from the high-water mark, as\r\nit is perpetually washed by the beating surges at every return of the\r\ntide, the platform lowers considerably, becoming more and more uneven,\r\nso as not to be walked on but with the greatest care. At the distance of\r\na hundred and fifty yards from the cliffs, it turns a little to the east\r\nfor the space of twenty or thirty yards, and then sinks into the sea.\r\nThe figure of these columns is, with few exceptions, pentagonal, or\r\ncomposed of five sides; and the spectator must look very narrowly indeed\r\nto find any of a different construction, having three, four or six\r\nsides. What is very extraordinary, and particularly curious is, that\r\nthere are not two columns in ten thousand to be found, which either have\r\ntheir sides equal among themselves, or display a like figure.\r\n\r\nThe composition of these columns or pillars, is also deserving the\r\nattention of the curious observer. They are not of one solid stone in an\r\nupright position, but composed of several short lengths, nicely joined,\r\nnot with flat surfaces, but articulated into each other like a ball and\r\nsocket, or like the joints in the vertebræ of some of the larger kinds\r\nof fish, the one at the joint having a cavity, into which the convex end\r\nof the opposite is exactly fitted. This is not visible unless on\r\ndisjointing the two stones. The depth of the concavity or convexity is\r\ngenerally about three or four inches. It is still further remarkable,\r\nthat the convexity and correspondent concavity of the joint, are not\r\nconformable to the external angular figure of the column, but exactly\r\nround, and as large as the size or diameter of the column will admit;\r\nconsequently, as the angles of these columns are in general very\r\nunequal, the circular edges of the joints are seldom coincident with\r\nmore than two or three sides of the pentagonal, and are, from the edge\r\nof the circular part of the joint to the exterior sides and angles,\r\nquite plain. It ought likewise to be noticed as a singular curiosity,\r\nthat the articulations of these joints are frequently inverted, in some\r\nof them the concavity being upward, in others the reverse. This\r\noccasions that variety and mixture of concavities and convexities on the\r\ntops of the columns, which is observable throughout the platform of this\r\ncauseway, without any discoverable design or regularity with respect to\r\nthe number of either.\r\n\r\nThe length of these particular stones, from joint to joint, is various:\r\nthey are in general from eighteen inches to two feet long; and for the\r\ngreater part, longer toward the bottom of the columns than nearer the\r\ntop, the articulation of the joints being there somewhat deeper. The\r\nsize, or diameter, likewise of the columns, is as different as their\r\nlength and figure: in general they are from fifteen to twenty inches in\r\ndiameter. Throughout the whole of this combination there are no traces\r\nof uniformity or design, except in the form of the joint, which is\r\ninvariably by an articulation of the convex into the concave of the\r\npiece next above or below it: nor are there traces of a finishing in any\r\npart, whether in the hight, length or breadth. If there be particular\r\ninstances in which the columns above water have a smooth top, others\r\nnear them, of an equal hight, are more or less convex or concave, which\r\nshows them to have been joined to pieces that have been washed away, or\r\nby other means taken off. It can not be doubted but that those parts\r\nwhich are constantly above water have gradually become more and more\r\neven, at the same time that the remaining surfaces of the joints must\r\nnecessarily have been worn smoother, by the constant action of the air,\r\nand by the friction in walking over them, than where the sea, at every\r\ntide, beats on the causeway, continually removing some of the upper\r\nstones, and exposing fresh joints. As all the exterior columns, which\r\nhave two or three sides exposed to view, preserve their diameters from\r\ntop to bottom, it may be inferred, that such is also the case with the\r\ninterior columns, the tops of which alone are visible.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the general dissimilitude of the columns, relatively to\r\ntheir figure and diameter, they are so arranged and combined at all the\r\npoints, that a knife can scarcely be introduced between them, either at\r\nthe sides or angles. It is most interesting to examine the close\r\ncontexture and nice insertion of the infinite variety of forms exhibited\r\non the surface of this grand parade. From the great dissimilarity of the\r\nfigures of the columns, the spectator would be led to believe the\r\ncauseway a work of human art, were it not, on the other hand,\r\ninconceivable that the genius or invention of man should construct and\r\ncombine such an infinite number of columns, which should have a general\r\napparent likeness, and still be so universally dissimilar in their\r\nfigure, as that on the minutest examination, not two in ten or twenty\r\nthousand should be found having their angles and sides equal among\r\nthemselves, or those of one column to those of another. As there is an\r\ninfinite variety in the configuration of the several parts, so there are\r\nno traces of regularity or design in the outlines of this curious\r\nphenomenon: including the broken or detached pieces of a similar\r\nstructure, they are extremely scattered and confused. Whatever may have\r\nbeen their original state, they do not at present appear to have any\r\nconnection with the grand or principal causeway, as to any supposable\r\ndesign or use in its first construction; and as little design can be\r\ninferred from the figure or position of the several constituent parts.\r\n\r\nThis singular formation is not confined to the Giant’s Causeway; but to\r\nquite a distance from it, the cliffs exhibit, in many parts, similar\r\ncolumns. At the depth of ten or twelve feet from the summit of the cape\r\nof Bengore, the rock begins to assume a columnar tendency, and forms a\r\nrange of massy pillars of basalt, which stand perpendicular to the\r\nhorizon, presenting in the sharp face of the promontory, the appearance\r\nof a magnificent gallery or colonnade, upward of sixty feet in hight.\r\nThis colonnade is supported on a solid base of coarse, black, irregular\r\nrock, nearly sixty feet thick, abounding in what are called blebs, (that\r\nis, little blisters as it were on the rock,) and also in air holes; but,\r\nthough comparatively irregular, it evidently affects a peculiar figure,\r\ntending in many places to run into regular forms, resembling the\r\nshooting of salts and many other substances during a hasty\r\ncrystallization. Beneath this great bed of stone, stands a second range\r\nof pillars from forty to fifty feet high, more exactly defined, and\r\nemulating in the neatness of its columns, those of the Giant’s Causeway.\r\nThis lower range is upborne by a layer of red ocher stone, which serves\r\nas a relief to show it to greater advantage. The two admirable natural\r\ngalleries, with the interjacent masses of irregular rock, form a\r\nperpendicular hight of one hundred and seventy feet, from the base of\r\nwhich the promontory, covered with rock and grass, slopes down to the\r\nsea a considerable space, so as to give an additional hight of two\r\nhundred feet, making in all nearly four hundred feet of perpendicular\r\nelevation, and presenting a mass, which for beauty and variety of\r\ncoloring, for elegance and novelty of arrangement, and for the\r\nextraordinary magnitude of its objects, can not, perhaps, be rivaled by\r\nanything at present known.\r\n\r\nThe promontory of Fairhead raises its lofty summit more than four\r\nhundred feet above the level of the sea, and forms the eastern\r\ntermination of Ballycastle bay. It presents a vast compact mass of rude\r\ncolumnar stones, the forms of which are extremely gross, many being a\r\nhundred and fifty feet in length. At the base of these gigantic columns\r\nlies a wild waste of natural ruins of an enormous size, which, in the\r\ncourse of successive ages, have been tumbled down from their foundations\r\nby storms, or some more powerful operations of nature. These massive\r\nbodies have occasionally withstood the shock of their fall, and often\r\nlie in groups, and clumps of pillars, resembling artificial ruins, and\r\nforming a very novel and striking landscape.\r\n\r\nMany of these pillars lie to the east, in the very bottom of the bay, at\r\nthe distance of about one-third of a mile from the causeway. There the\r\nearth has evidently fallen away from them upon the strand, and exhibits\r\na very curious arrangement of pentagonal columns, in a perpendicular\r\nposition, apparently supporting a cliff of different strata of earth,\r\nclay, rock, &c., to the hight of a hundred and fifty feet. Some of these\r\ncolumns are from thirty to forty feet high, from the top of the sloping\r\nbank beneath them; and being longer in the middle of the arrangement,\r\nshortening on either of the sides, have obtained the appellation of\r\n_organs_, from a rude likeness in this particular to the exterior or\r\nfrontal tubes of that instrument. As there are few broken pieces on the\r\nstrand, near this assemblage of columns, it is probable that the outside\r\nrange, as it now appears, is in reality the original exterior line\r\ntoward the sea; but how far these columns extend internally into the\r\nbowels of the incumbent cliff is unknown. The very substance, indeed, of\r\nthat part of the cliff which projects to a point, between the two bays\r\non the east and west of the causeway, seems composed of similar\r\nmaterials; for, besides the many pieces which are seen on the sides of\r\nthe cliff, as it winds to the bottom of the bays, particularly on the\r\neastern side, there is at the very point of the cliff, and just above\r\nthe narrow and highest part of the causeway, a long collection of them,\r\nthe heads or summits of which just appearing without the sloping bank,\r\nmake it evident that they lie in a sleeping position, and about half-way\r\nbetween the perpendicular and horizontal. The heads of these columns are\r\nlikewise of mixed surfaces, convex and concave; and they evidently\r\nappear to have been removed from their original upright position, to the\r\ninclining or oblique one they have now assumed, by the sinking or\r\nfalling of the cliff.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           BASALTIC COLUMNS.\r\n\r\nIn the country surrounding Padua, in Italy, there are several basaltic\r\ncolumns, similar to those of the Giant’s Causeway, although less\r\nmagnificent in appearance. About seven miles in a southern direction\r\nfrom that city, is a hill named Monte Rosso, or the Red mount, which\r\npresents a natural range of prismatic columns, of different shapes and\r\nsizes, placed in a direction nearly perpendicular to the horizon, and\r\nparallel to each other, nearly resembling that part of the Giant’s\r\nCauseway, called the organs.\r\n\r\nAt an inconsiderable distance is another basaltine hill, called _Il\r\nmonte del Diavolo_, or the Devil’s hill, along the sides of which\r\nprismatic columns are arranged in an oblique position. This causeway\r\nextends along the side of the vale beneath, with nearly the same\r\narrangement of the columns as is displayed on the hill. Although the\r\ncolumns of both these hills are of the simple, or unjointed kind, still\r\nthey differ very remarkably from each other in many respects, but\r\nprincipally in their forms, and in the texture and quality of their\r\nparts. Those of the Monte del Diavolo commonly approach a circular form,\r\nas nearly as their angles will allow; which is also observable in the\r\ncolumns of the Giant’s Causeway and of most other basaltic groups. On\r\nthe contrary, those of Monte Rosso assume an oblong or oval figure. The\r\ncolumns of the former measure, one with the other, nearly a foot in\r\ndiameter, varying but little in their size; while those of the latter\r\npresent a great variety in their dimensions, the diameter of some of\r\nthem being nearly a foot, and that of others scarcely three inches:\r\ntheir common width may be estimated at six or eight inches. They differ,\r\ntherefore, very considerably in size from those of the Giant’s Causeway,\r\nsome of which measure two feet in width. The length of the columns of\r\nthe Monte del Diavolo can not be ascertained, as they present only their\r\nsummits to the view: their remaining parts are deeply buried in the\r\nhill, and in some places entirely covered. Those of Monte Rosso, as far\r\nas they are visible, measure from six to eight or ten feet in hight; an\r\ninconsiderable size when compared with the hight of those of the Giant’s\r\nCauseway. The columns of these groups display, however, all the\r\nvarieties of prismatic forms, which are observable in those of the\r\nlatter, and other similar groups. They are usually of five, six or seven\r\nsides; but the hexagonal form seems chiefly to prevail.\r\n\r\nThe texture and quality of these columns are not less different than\r\ntheir forms. Those of the Monte del Diavolo present a smooth surface,\r\nand, when broken, appear within of a dark iron-gray color, manifesting\r\nalso a very solid and uniform texture; in which characters they\r\ncorrespond with the columns of the Giant’s Causeway, and those of most\r\nother basaltic groups. But the columns of Monte Rosso are in these\r\nrespects very different, having not only a very rough (and sometimes\r\nknotty) surface, but displaying likewise, when broken, a variegated\r\ncolor and unequal texture of parts. They are commonly speckled, more or\r\nless distinctly, and resemble an inferior sort of granite, of which\r\nMonte Rosso is itself formed, and which serves as a base to the range of\r\ncolumns in question. It is, in general, not quite so hard as the alpine\r\nand oriental granites, and is sometimes even friable. This species of\r\ngranite abounds in France, where large tracts of it are to be seen in\r\nAuvergne, and the adjoining regions. But it is still more common in\r\nItaly, seeing that, besides Monte Rosso, the bulk of the Euganean hills,\r\nof which that is a part, principally consists of it; and these hills\r\noccupy a considerable tract in the plains of Lombardy. It is also common\r\nin the Roman and Tuscan states; and of this substance the mountain close\r\nto Viterbo, on the road to Rome, is entirely composed. The columns of\r\nMonte Rosso appear, therefore, of a different character from any\r\nhitherto described by mineralogists, who mention those only of an\r\nuniform color and texture. But the great singularity here is, that such\r\na range of prismatic columns should be found, bedded as it were, in a\r\nmass of granite, and composed nearly of the same substance. An instance\r\nof this kind, relative to any other causeway, is not recorded; and this\r\ncircumstance seems to render that of Monte Rosso, in one respect at\r\nleast, more curious and singular than the celebrated Giant’s Causeway is\r\nknown to be, from the regular articulation of its columns. It is\r\ncertain, that the basaltic group of Monte Rosso is not only highly\r\ncurious in itself, but interesting on account of the great light it\r\nthrows on the origin of granites in general.\r\n\r\nIt is likewise remarkable, that the columns in the two groups of Monte\r\nRosso and Monte del Diavolo, preserve respectively the same position,\r\nnearly parallel to each other; which is not usually the case in basaltic\r\ngroups. For, although the principal aggregate of which the Giant’s\r\nCauseway is formed, stands in a direction perpendicular to the horizon,\r\nstill other small detached groups of columns also appear on the eminence\r\nabove, assuming by their position different degrees of obliquity. Among\r\nthe numerous basaltic hills of Auvergne and the adjoining regions, in\r\nFrance, phenomena which seem to abound in those provinces more than in\r\nany other part of Europe, and, perhaps, of the known globe, nothing is\r\nmore common than to see the columns of the same group lying in all\r\npossible directions, as irregularly almost as the prisms in a mass of\r\ncommon crystal. Nor is this variety of position so observable in single\r\ncolumns as in whole masses or ranges of them, that often present\r\nthemselves on the same hill, disposed in different strata or stages, as\r\nit were, one above the other, many of them assuming very different, and\r\neven opposite directions. The columns of the Monte del Diavolo are\r\nbedded in a kind of volcanic sand, by which, in many parts of the hill,\r\nthey are entirely covered: it is probable, however, that they repose\r\nbeneath on a base of basaltic rock of a similar nature. Nothing is more\r\ncommon, in the provinces of France, above mentioned, than to see\r\ninsulated basaltic hills almost exclusively composed of different layers\r\nof columns, which present themselves in stages, one above the other,\r\noften without any other stratum between them, resembling in some\r\nmeasure, if the comparison can be allowed, a huge pile or stack of cleft\r\nwood. Although the columnar crystallization of Monte Rosso is the only\r\none yet known or described, in a mass of granite, still other groups of\r\ncolumns have elsewhere been met with, which are equally of a\r\nheterogeneous substance or texture, however they may otherwise differ\r\nfrom those of Monte Rosso, as well as from the common basalts.\r\n\r\n\r\n              -------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n                            NATURAL BRIDGES.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  ------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n                      NATURAL BRIDGES OF ICONONZO.\r\n\r\nAmid the majestic and varied scenery of the Cordilleras of South\r\nAmerica, that of their valleys most forcibly strikes the imagination of\r\nforeign travelers. The enormous hight of these mountains is not\r\ndiscoverable but at a considerable distance, and while the spectator is\r\non one of those plains which extend from the sea-coasts to the foot of\r\nthe central chain. The flats, or table-lands, which surround the\r\nsnow-clad summits of the mountains, are themselves, for the greater\r\npart, of an elevation of from seven to nine thousand feet, or nearly a\r\nmile and three-quarters, above the level of the sea. This circumstance\r\ndiminishes, to a certain degree, the impression of greatness produced by\r\nthe colossal masses of Chimborazo, Cotopaxi, Pichincha, &c., when seen\r\nfrom the flats of Riobamba, or from those of Quito. It is not, however,\r\nwith the valleys as with the mountains: deeper and narrower than those\r\nof the Alps and the Pyrenees, the valleys of the Cordilleras present\r\nsituations still more wild than these, and more adapted to fill the soul\r\nwith admiration and with terror. Fissures and chasms present themselves,\r\nhaving their bottoms and sides ornamented with a vigorous vegetation,\r\nand of such a depth, that Vesuvius and the Puy-de-Dome might be placed\r\nwithin several of them, and not show their summits above the edge of the\r\nneighboring mountains. In passing along the back of the Andes, from\r\nPasto to Villa d’Ibarra, and in descending the Loxa toward the banks of\r\nthe river Amazon, the traveler reaches the celebrated fissures of Chota\r\nand Cutaco, the former of which is nearly a mile, and the latter upward\r\nof three-quarters of a mile, in perpendicular depth. To give a more\r\ncomplete idea of the grandeur of these geological phenomena, it should\r\nbe observed, that the bottoms of these fissures are by one-fourth only,\r\nless elevated above the level of the sea, than the passages of St.\r\nGothard and Mount Cenis.\r\n\r\nThe valley of Icononzo, or of Pandi, is less remarkable for its\r\ndimensions, than for the extraordinary form of its rocks, which appear\r\nas if shaped by the hand of man. Their naked and barren summits form the\r\nmost picturesque contrasts with the tufts of trees and herbaceous\r\nvegetables which cover the edges of the fissure. The little torrent\r\nwhich has worked itself a passage through the valley of Icononzo, bears\r\nthe name of Rio de la Summa Paz. It descends from the eastern chain of\r\nthe Andes, which, with the republic of New Grenada, separates the basin\r\nof the river of Magdelena from the vast plains of the Meta, Guaviare and\r\nOronoco. This torrent, confined within a bed almost inaccessible, could\r\nnot have been crossed without many difficulties, had not Nature herself\r\nformed TWO BRIDGES OF ROCKS, which are justly regarded in the country as\r\namong the objects most worthy of the attention of travelers. These\r\nNATURAL BRIDGES are on the route from Bogota to Popayan and Quito.\r\n\r\nIcononzo is the name of an ancient village of Muyscas Indians, situated\r\non the south side of the valley, and of which scarcely any vestige now\r\nremains, except a few scattered huts. The nearest inhabited place to\r\nthis remarkable spot is the little village of Pandi, or Mercadillo,\r\ndistant about a mile. The road from Bogota to Fusagasuga, and thence to\r\nPandi, is one of the most difficult and least beaten to be met with in\r\nthe Andes. None but those who passionately love the beauties of Nature,\r\nwould fail to prefer the usual road which leads from the flat of Bogota\r\nto the banks of the Magdelena, to the perilous descent from the Paramo\r\nde San-Fortunato, and the mountains of Fusagasuga, toward the natural\r\nbridges of Icononzo.\r\n\r\nThe deep chasm through which the torrent of Summa Paz precipitates\r\nitself, occupies the center of the valley of Icononzo. Near the first\r\nnatural bridge, it maintains, for a length of nearly four-fifths of a\r\nmile, a direction from east to west. The river forms two fine cascades,\r\nthe one at the spot where it enters the chasm on the west of Doa, and\r\nthe other at that where it leaves it, in descending toward Melgar. It is\r\npossible that this chasm, which resembles, but on an enormous scale, the\r\ngallery of a mine, may have been the result of an earthquake, and that,\r\nat its formation, the compact bed of quartz, composing the superior\r\nstratum of rock, had resisted the force which tore asunder these\r\nmountains. The uninterrupted continuation of this quartzose bed would\r\nthus form the bridge, which affords a passage from one part of the\r\nvalley to the other. This surprising natural arch is forty-eight feet in\r\nlength, forty in width, and eight feet in thickness at the center. By\r\nexperiments carefully made on the fall of bodies, its hight above the\r\nlevel of the water of the torrent, has been ascertained to be about\r\nthree hundred and twenty feet. The depth of the torrent at the mean\r\nhight of the water, may be estimated at twenty feet. The Indians of the\r\nvalley of Icononzo, for the security of travelers, have formed a fence\r\nof reeds, which extends to the road leading to this first natural\r\nbridge.\r\n\r\nAt the distance of sixty feet below is another, to which the traveler is\r\nconducted by a path descending along the edge of the chasm. Three\r\nenormous masses of rock have fallen into such positions as enable them\r\nreciprocally to support each other. The one in the center forms the key\r\nof the vault, an accident which may have conveyed to the natives of this\r\nspot an idea of arched masonry, which was unknown to the people of the\r\nnew world, as well as to the ancient inhabitants of Egypt. It is\r\nuncertain whether these portions of rock have been projected from a\r\ndistance, or are merely the fragments of an arch which has been\r\ndestroyed on the spot, but which was originally similar to the upper\r\nnatural bridge. This last supposition is rendered probable by an\r\nanalogous accident, observable in the Coliseum at Rome, where there are\r\nseen, in a wall half-fallen, several stones which were arrested in their\r\ndescent, because in falling they happened to form an arch. In the midst\r\nof this second natural bridge is an aperture of about twenty-five feet\r\nin every direction, through which the eye reaches the bottom of the\r\nabyss. The torrent appears to run into a dark cavern, whence a mournful\r\nsound proceeds, formed by the cries of an infinity of nocturnal birds\r\nwhich inhabit the chasm, and which at first sight may be taken for those\r\nbats of a monstrous size, so well known in the equinoctial regions. They\r\ncan only be perceived by the help of lighted brands, thrown into the\r\nchasm to illuminate its sides; and thousands of them may thus be\r\ndistinguished, skimming along the surface of the water. Their plumage is\r\nuniformly of a brown gray color; and M. Humboldt, from whose account\r\nthese particulars are extracted, was assured by the Indians, that these\r\nhitherto undescribed birds are of the size of a chicken, with the eyes\r\nof an owl, and a curved beak. On account of the depth of the valley, it\r\nwas impossible to obtain a near view of them.\r\n\r\nThe elevation of the bridges of Icononzo, these surprising productions\r\nof nature, above the level of the ocean, is two thousand seven hundred\r\nfeet, somewhat more than half a mile. In concluding his description of\r\nthem, M. Humboldt has noticed several other natural bridges, among which\r\nis that in Virginia, noticed more particularly below. He considers this,\r\nas well as the bridge of earth, called Rumichaca, which is on the\r\ndeclivity of the porphyritic mountains of Chumban, in South America;\r\ntogether with the bridge of Madre de Dios, named Dantcu, near Totonilco,\r\nin Mexico; and the perforated rock near Grandola, in the province of\r\nAlemtejo, in Portugal, as geological phenomena, which have some\r\nresemblance to the natural bridges of Icononzo; but he doubts whether,\r\nin any other part of the world, there has yet been discovered an\r\naccidental arrangement so extraordinary as that of three masses of rock,\r\nwhich, reciprocally sustaining each other, form a natural arch.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      NATURAL BRIDGE IN VIRGINIA.\r\n\r\nThis natural bridge, which has been described by Mr. Jefferson, and many\r\nother writers, is one of the most sublime productions of nature, as well\r\nas one of the great curiosities and wonders of the world. It is situated\r\nin Rockbridge county, in Virginia, on the ascent of a hill which seems\r\nto have been cloven through its length by some mighty convulsion. It\r\nconsists of a stupendous arch of limestone, spanning a small stream,\r\ncalled Cedar creek. Its hight above the stream to the top, is two\r\nhundred and fifteen feet; its average width, eighty feet; its extreme\r\nlength at the top, ninety-three feet; and its thickness, from the under\r\nto the upper side, fifty-five feet. The chasm over which it passes, is\r\nfifty feet wide at the bottom, and ninety feet at the top. The view from\r\nthe top is exceedingly grand and impressive; from below, equally sublime\r\nand more interesting, because divested of associations of fear. The\r\nbridge is of important use, forming a road over this immense chasm,\r\nwhich is not otherwise passable for several miles in either direction.\r\nThe top of the bridge is covered with a coat of earth, which affords\r\ngrowth to many large trees. The residue, with the hill on both sides, is\r\na solid rock of limestone. The arch, as is seen in the engraving of the\r\nbridge, approaches the semi-elliptical form; though the larger axis of\r\nthe ellipsis, which would be the chord of the arch, is many times longer\r\nthan its transverse. Although the sides of this bridge are provided in\r\nsome parts with a parapet of rocks, yet few persons have sufficient\r\nresolution to stand on them, and look over into the abyss. The passenger\r\ninvoluntarily falls on his hands, creeps to the parapet and peeps over\r\nit. Looking down from this hight, for the space of a minute, occasions\r\ngiddiness and sometimes headache. But if the view from above be so\r\npainful as not long to be borne, that from beneath is delightful in the\r\nextreme. It is impossible for the emotions arising from the sublime, to\r\nbe felt in a greater degree than at this spot. The sensations of the\r\nspectator can not be described, when he surveys an arch at once so\r\nbeautiful, so elevated, and so light, springing up, as it were, to\r\nheaven!\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThis grand natural bridge, as already mentioned, is of limestone; and\r\nthis is so soft that it may easily be cut with a knife. In this fact\r\nthere may be a foundation for the following interesting, though somewhat\r\noverdrawn sketch, from the graphic pen of Elihu Burritt, designed to\r\nillustrate the effect of perseverance and an honorable ambition.\r\n\r\n“The scene opens with a view of the great natural bridge in Virginia.\r\nThere are three or four lads standing in the channel below, looking up\r\nwith awe to that vast arch of unhewn rocks, which the Almighty bridged\r\nover those everlasting butments ‘when the morning stars sang together.’\r\nThe little piece of sky spanning those measureless piers, is full of\r\nstars, although it is midday. It is almost five hundred feet from where\r\nthey stand, up those perpendicular bulwarks of limestone, to the\r\nkey-rock of that vast arch, which appears to them only of the size of a\r\nman’s hand. The silence of death is rendered more impressive by the\r\nlittle stream that falls from rock to rock down the channel. The sun is\r\ndarkened, and the boys have unconsciously uncovered their heads, as if\r\nstanding in the presence-chamber of the Majesty of the whole earth. At\r\nlast, this feeling begins to wear away; they look around, and find that\r\nothers have been there before them. They see the names of hundreds cut\r\nin the limestone butments. A new feeling comes over their young hearts,\r\nand their knives are in their hands in an instant. ‘What man has done,\r\nman can do,’ is their watchword, while they draw themselves up, and\r\ncarve their names a foot above those of a hundred full-grown men who\r\nhave been there before them. They are all satisfied with this feat of\r\nphysical exertion, except _one_, whose example illustrates perfectly the\r\nforgotten truth, that there is _no royal road to intellectual eminence_.\r\nThis ambitious youth sees a name just above his reach, a name that will\r\nbe green in the memory of the world, when those of Alexander, Cæsar, and\r\nBonaparte, shall rot in oblivion. It was the name of Washington. Before\r\nhe marched with Braddock to that fatal field, _he_ had been there, and\r\nleft his name a foot above all his predecessors. It was a glorious\r\nthought of the boy, to write his name side by side with that of the\r\ngreat father of his country. He grasps his knife with a firmer hand;\r\nand, clinging to a little jutting crag, he cuts again into the\r\nlimestone, about a foot above where he stands; he then reaches up and\r\ncuts another for his hands. ’Tis a dangerous adventure; but as he puts\r\nhis feet and hands into those gains, and draws himself up carefully to\r\nhis full length, he finds himself a foot above every name chronicled in\r\nthat mighty wall. While his companions are regarding him with concern\r\nand admiration, he cuts his name in rude capitals, large and deep, into\r\nthat rocky album. His knife is in his hand, and strength in his sinews,\r\nand a new created aspiration in his heart. Again he cuts another niche,\r\nand again he carves his name in larger capitals. This is not enough.\r\nHeedless of the entreaties of his companions, he cuts and climbs again.\r\nThe graduations of his ascending scale grow wider apart. He measures his\r\nlength at every gain he cuts. The voices of his friends wax weaker and\r\nweaker, till their words are finally lost on his ear. He now for the\r\nfirst time casts a look beneath him. Had that glance lasted a moment,\r\nthat moment would have been his last. He clings with a convulsive\r\nshudder to his little niche in the rock. An awful abyss awaits his\r\nalmost certain fall. He is faint with severe exertion, and trembling\r\nfrom the sudden view of the dreadful destruction to which he is exposed.\r\nHis knife is worn half-way to the haft. He can hear the voices, but not\r\nthe words, of his terror-stricken companions below. What a moment! What\r\na meager chance to escape destruction! There is no retracing his steps.\r\nIt is impossible to put his hands into the same niche with his feet, and\r\nretain his slender hold a moment. His companions instantly perceive this\r\nnew and fearful dilemma, and await his fall with emotions that ‘freeze\r\ntheir young blood.’ He is too high, too faint, to ask for his father and\r\nmother, his brothers and sisters, to come and witness or avert his\r\ndestruction. But one of his companions anticipates his desire. Swift as\r\nthe wind, he bounds down the channel, and the situation of the fated boy\r\nis told upon his father’s hearth-stone.\r\n\r\n“Minutes of almost eternal length roll on, and there are hundreds\r\nstanding in that rocky channel, and hundreds on the bridge above, all\r\nholding their breath, and awaiting the fearful catastrophe. The poor\r\nboy hears the hum of new and numerous voices both above and below. He\r\ncan just distinguish the tones of his father, who is shouting with all\r\nthe energy of despair, ‘_William! William! Don’t look down! Your\r\nmother, and Henry, and Harriet are all here, praying for you! Don’t\r\nlook down! Keep your eye toward the top!_’ The boy didn’t look _down_.\r\nHis eye is fixed like a flint toward heaven, and his young heart on\r\nHim who reigns there. He grasps again his knife. He cuts another\r\nniche, and another foot is added to the hundreds that remove him from\r\nthe reach of human help from below. How carefully he uses his wasting\r\nblade! How anxiously he selects the softest places in that vast pier!\r\nHow he avoids every flinty grain! How he economizes his physical\r\npowers! resting a moment at each gain he cuts. How every motion is\r\nwatched from below! There stand his father, mother, brother, sister,\r\non the very spot where, if he falls, he will not fall alone. The sun\r\nis now half-way down the west. The lad has made fifty additional\r\nniches in that mighty wall, and now finds himself directly under the\r\nmiddle of that vast arch of rocks, earth and trees. He must cut his\r\nway in a new direction, to get from under this overhanging mountain.\r\nThe inspiration of hope is dying in his bosom; its vital heat is fed\r\nby the increasing shouts of hundreds perched upon cliffs and trees,\r\nand others who stand with ropes in their hands on the bridge above, or\r\nwith ladders below. Fifty gains more must be cut before the longest\r\nrope can reach him. His wasting blade strikes again into the\r\nlimestone. The boy is emerging painfully, foot by foot, from under\r\nthat lofty arch. Spliced ropes are ready in the hands of those who are\r\nleaning over the outer edge of the bridge. Two minutes more, and all\r\nwill be over. That blade is worn to the last half-inch. The boy’s head\r\nreels; his eyes are starting from their sockets. His last hope is\r\ndying in his heart; his life must hang upon the next gain he cuts.\r\nThat niche is his last. At the last faint gash he makes, his knife,\r\nhis faithful knife, falls from his little nerveless hand, and, ringing\r\nalong the precipice, falls at his mother’s feet. An involuntary groan\r\nof despair runs like a death-knell through the channel below, and all\r\nis still as the grave. At the hight of nearly three hundred feet, the\r\ndevoted boy lifts his hopeless heart and closing eyes to commend his\r\nsoul to God. ’Tis but a moment—there!—one foot swings off!—he is\r\nreeling—trembling—toppling over into eternity! Hark! a shout falls on\r\nhis ear from above! The man who is lying with half his length over the\r\nbridge, has caught a glimpse of the boy’s head and shoulders. Quick as\r\nthought, the noosed rope is within reach of the sinking youth. No one\r\nbreathes. With a faint, convulsive effort, the swooning boy drops his\r\narms into the noose. Darkness comes over him, and with the words,\r\n_God!_ and _Mother!_ whispered on his lips just loud enough to be\r\nheard in heaven, the tightening rope lifts him out of his last shallow\r\nniche. Not a lip moves while he is dangling over that fearful abyss;\r\nbut when a sturdy Virginian reaches down and draws up the lad, and\r\nholds him up in his arms before the tearful, breathless multitude,\r\nsuch shouting and leaping and weeping for joy, never greeted the ear\r\nof a human being so recovered from the yawning gulf of eternity.”\r\n\r\nWe will only add before leaving the subject of natural bridges, that the\r\none in Virginia is not, as has been generally supposed, the only\r\ngeological wonder of the kind in the United States. In Carter county,\r\nKentucky, there is a natural bridge across the Rockbridge branch of the\r\nCany fork of Little Sandy. It has a span of one hundred and ninety-five\r\nfeet, and is twelve feet wide, twenty feet thick in the middle of the\r\narch, and one hundred and seven feet above the water. In the county of\r\nWalker, in Alabama, there is another similar natural curiosity, which\r\nwas discovered in a recent geological exploration. The span is one\r\nhundred and twenty feet, and the hight nearly seventy feet. This bridge\r\nis formed of sandstone, and is very symmetrical. Large beech and hemlock\r\ntrees grow on the bridge, and the surrounding scenery is represented as\r\nsublime.\r\n\r\n\r\n              -------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n                      PRECIPICES AND PROMONTORIES.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  ------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n                             BESSELY GHAUT.\r\n\r\nThe precipitous pathways which frequently occur in the Indian Apennines,\r\na chain of mountains extending along the western or Malabar coasts of\r\nthe peninsula, are called ghauts; and of these abrupt and perpendicular\r\nprecipices, Bessely ghaut is considered as the most romantic. It is\r\nadmirably described in the travels of Lord Valentia, from which the\r\nfollowing particulars are extracted.\r\n\r\nOn entering the defiles of the chain of mountains by which the\r\ntable-land of Mysore is separated from the low country of Canara and\r\nMalabar, the scenery becomes extremely wild and romantic. Having reached\r\nPurneah Chuttoor, situated on the summit of this celebrated ghaut, his\r\nlordship began his descent at three in the morning, by a road formed\r\nwith great labor out of a bed of loose rock, over which the torrents of\r\nthe preceding winter had run with such force, as to wash away all the\r\nsofter parts, and in several places to leave single rocks, of four or\r\nfive feet diameter, standing in the center of the road, and not more\r\nthan two feet asunder. He alighted from his palanquin to admire the\r\nsublimity of the scene, and entered a forest of the largest oriental\r\ntrees, several of which were one hundred feet in the stem before a\r\nsingle branch extended itself; notwithstanding which, the descent was so\r\nsteep, that he was frequently on a level with their tops, at so small a\r\ndistance as to be able to distinguish them, by the gleam of the numerous\r\ntorches by which his party was accompanied, but which were insufficient\r\nto enlighten the impenetrable canopy of foliage which for miles\r\nconcealed the face of heaven, or the deep gloom of the abyss into which\r\nhe appeared to descend. In the day-time the scene could not have been\r\nhalf so awful or magnificent. The descent was impeded by numerous droves\r\nof oxen which were ascending the ghaut. At break of day an opening, in a\r\nwinding part of the road, displayed the lofty mountain the party had\r\ndescended, covered with forests nearly to its summit. They passed\r\nseveral rivulets, which at one spot had united, and formed a small\r\nstream. The surrounding vegetation was richly variegated; and the\r\nbranches of the loftiest trees covered by plants of the parasitical\r\ntribe. The inhabitants of a small village, in the center of this immense\r\nforest, were employed in thrashing their grain in a truly patriarchal\r\nmanner: on a floor of hard earth the grain was trodden out by oxen,\r\nwhich, agreeably to the Mosaical law, were unmuzzled.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         THE CAPE OF THE WINDS.\r\n\r\nThe fortress of Mankoop, in the Crimea, is of a very extraordinary\r\nmagnitude, and may be described as being literally stationed on the\r\nclouds. It covers the summit of a semicircular insulated mountain,\r\nwhich, from its frightful aspect, its altitude, and craggy perpendicular\r\nsides, independently of every other consideration than as a surprising\r\nwork of nature, fills the mind with wonder on entering the defile. In\r\nthis singular situation, where there are no visible means of ascent\r\ntoward the hight, and still less of conveying the necessary materials\r\nfor the completion of so astonishing a work, the Genoese constructed\r\nthis citadel, perhaps without a parallel in Europe, the result of their\r\nwealth, address and enterprise. Being at a remote distance from the\r\ncoast, it is natural to conjecture that it was employed to curb the\r\nhostile spirit of the natives toward the maritime colonial possessions.\r\nThe latest possessors of this fortress were Jews, in the cemetery of\r\nwhose colony the traveler meets with ruined tombs of marble and stone,\r\nlying beneath the trees he has to pass in his ascent.\r\n\r\nThe whole of the passage up the mountain is steep and difficult; nor is\r\nit rendered more practicable by the amazing labors of its original\r\npossessors, whose dilapidated works occur almost at every step. On\r\nreaching the summit, caverns and gloomy galleries, perforated in the\r\nrock, present on every side their dark mouths. On the most elevated part\r\nof this extraordinary eminence, is a beautiful plain, covered with fine\r\nturf: it is partly fenced in by the moldering wall of the fortress, but\r\notherwise open to the surrounding precipices. From this spot the\r\nadjacent mountains, valleys, hills, woods and villages, may be\r\ndiscerned. “While,” observes the traveler by whom these details are\r\nsupplied, “with dismay and caution we crept on our hands and knees to\r\nlook over the brink of these fearful hights, a half-clad Tartar, wild as\r\nthe winds of the north, mounted without a saddle, and without any other\r\nbridle except the twisted stem of a wild vine, on a colt equally\r\nunsubdued, galloped to the very edge of the precipice, where, as his\r\nhorse stood prancing on the borders of eternity, he amused himself with\r\npointing out to us the different places in the vast district which the\r\neye commanded. We entered one of the excavated chambers, a small square\r\napartment, which led to another on our right hand; and, on our left, a\r\nnarrow passage conducted us to an open balcony, with a parapet in front,\r\nformed of the rock, on the very face of one of the principal precipices,\r\nwhence the depth below might be contemplated with less danger. The\r\nvultures which hovered over the valleys did not appear larger than\r\nswallows; and the tops of the hills, covered by tufted woods, with the\r\nvillages scattered amid the rocks and defiles, appeared at so\r\nintimidating a depth, that the blood chilled at the view. At length,\r\nbeing conducted to the north-eastern point of the crescent, that being\r\nthe shape of the summit on which the fortress of Mankoop was built, and\r\ndescending a few stone steps, neatly hewn out in the rock, we entered by\r\na square door the cavern, called by the Tartars, the Cape of the Winds.\r\nIt has been chiseled, like the rest, out of the solid stone; but is open\r\non four sides. From the amazing prospect here commanded of all the\r\nsurrounding country, it probably served as a post of military\r\nobservation. The apertures, or windows, are large arched chasms in the\r\nrock: through these, a most extensive range of scenery over the distant\r\nmountains and rolling clouds, forms a sublime spectacle. There is\r\nnothing in any part of Europe to surpass the tremendous grandeur of the\r\nplace. Beneath the cavern is another chamber leading to the several\r\ncells on its different sides: these have all been cut out of the same\r\nrock.”\r\n\r\nThe party, in descending, pursued a route, which, if they had taken in\r\ntheir ascent, would, our traveler observes, have afforded them a view of\r\nthe sublimest scenery imaginable. They now passed beneath an old arched\r\ngateway of the citadel, once its principal entrance. This road flanks\r\nthe northern side of the mountain; and the fall into the valley is so\r\nbold and profound, that a single false step would precipitate both horse\r\nand rider headlong to it. By alighting, the danger is avoided; and the\r\nterror of the descent is compensated by the noblest scenery the eye ever\r\nbeheld. It was dark before they reached the bottom; and they had some\r\ndifficulty to regain the principal road which leads through the defile,\r\nowing principally to the trees which project over all the lanes in the\r\nvicinity of Tartar villages, and so effectually obstruct the passage of\r\npersons on horseback, that they are in continual danger of being thrown.\r\nThe defile itself is not without danger in certain seasons of the year,\r\nimmense masses of limestone detaching themselves from the rocks above,\r\nand carrying all before them in their descent. Several of these masses,\r\ndetached from the northern precipices, had crossed the river at the\r\nbottom, and, by the prodigious velocity acquired in their descent, had\r\nactually rolled nearly half-way up the opposite side.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            THE NORTH CAPE.\r\n\r\nThis cape forms the most northerly point of the continent of Europe, and\r\nmay be regarded as one of the wonders of nature. It is situated within\r\nthe arctic circle, in seventy-one degrees, ten minutes, north latitude.\r\nIt has been accurately described by a voyager, from whose account the\r\nfollowing particulars are extracted.\r\n\r\nIn approaching the cape, a little before midnight, its rocks at first\r\nappeared to be nearly of an equal hight, until they terminated in a\r\nperpendicular peak; but, on a nearer view, those within were found to be\r\nmuch higher than those of the extreme peak, or point. Their general\r\nappearance was highly picturesque. The sea, breaking against this\r\nimmovable rampart, which had withstood its fury from the remotest ages,\r\nbellowed, and formed a thick border of white froth. This spectacle,\r\nequally beautiful and grand, was illumined by the _midnight sun_; and\r\nthe shade which covered the western side of the rocks rendered their\r\naspect still more sublime and almost terrific. The hight of these rocks\r\ncould not be ascertained; but here everything was on so grand a scale,\r\nthat a point of comparison could not be afforded by any ordinary known\r\nobjects. On landing, the party discovered a grotto, formed of rocks, the\r\nsurface of which had been washed smooth by the waves, and having within\r\na spring of fresh water. The only accessible spot in the vicinity was a\r\nhill, some hundred paces in circumference, surrounded by enormous crags.\r\nFrom the summit of this hill, turning toward the sea, they perceived to\r\nthe right a prodigious mountain, attached to the cape, and rearing its\r\nsterile mass to the skies. To the left, a neck of land, covered with\r\nless elevated rocks, against which the surges dashed with violence,\r\nclosed the bay, and admitted but a limited view of the ocean. To see as\r\nfar as possible into the interior, our navigators climbed almost to the\r\nsummit of the mountain, where a most singular landscape presented itself\r\nto the view. A lake in the foreground had an elevation of at least\r\nninety feet above the level of the sea; and on the top of an adjacent,\r\nbut less lofty mountain, was another lake. The view was terminated by\r\npeaked rocks, checkered by patches of snow.\r\n\r\nAt midnight the sun still remained several degrees above the horizon,\r\nand continued to ascend higher and higher till noon, when having again\r\ndescended, it passed the north, without dipping below the horizon. This\r\nphenomenon, which is as extraordinary to the inhabitants of the torrid\r\nand temperate zones, as snow is to the inhabitants of the torrid zone,\r\ncould not be viewed without a particular interest. Two months of\r\ncontinued daylight, during which space the sun never sets, seem to place\r\nthe traveler in a new state of existence; while the effect on the\r\ninhabitants of these regions is singular. During the time the sun is\r\nperpetually above the horizon, they rise at ten in the morning, dine at\r\nfive or six in the evening, and go to bed at one. But, during the winter\r\nseason, when, from the beginning of December until the end of January,\r\nthe sun never rises, they sleep above half of the twenty-four hours, and\r\nemploy the other half in sitting over the fire, all business being at an\r\nend, and a constant darkness prevailing. The cause of this phenomenon,\r\nas it affects the northern and southern regions of the earth, may be\r\nreadily understood. The sun always illumines half the earth at once, and\r\nshines on every side ninety degrees from the place where he is vertical.\r\nWhen he is vertical over the equator, or equidistant from both poles, he\r\nshines as far as each pole; and this happens in spring and autumn. But,\r\nas he declines to the north in summer, he shines beyond the north pole,\r\nand all the countries near that pole turn round in perpetual sunshine:\r\nwhile at the same time, he leaves the south pole an equal number of\r\ndegrees, so that those parts turn round in darkness.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       PRECIPICES OF SAN ANTONIA.\r\n\r\nThe mountain of San Antonia, on the route from Guyaquil to Quito, is\r\ndescribed by Ulloa as presenting a series of the most fearful\r\nprecipices. In crossing this mountain, the declivity was in some parts\r\nso great, that the mules could not have kept their footing, had not the\r\npaths been filled with holes, upward of two feet in depth, in which the\r\nmules placed their fore and hinder feet, occasionally dragging their\r\nbellies, and the legs of the rider, along the ground. Without these\r\nholes which serve as steps, the precipice would not be practicable.\r\nShould the creature happen, however, to place his foot between two of\r\nthese holes, or to falter in the slightest degree, the rider would fall,\r\nand perish inevitably. To lessen the difficulties and dangers of these\r\ncraggy paths, the Indians who go before the travelers, dig small\r\ntrenches across.\r\n\r\nThe descent from the hights was a task of imminent danger. Owing to the\r\nexcessive steepness, the water had washed away a greater part of the\r\nholes; while, on the one side were steep eminences, and on the other,\r\nthe most frightful abysses. The mules were themselves sensible of the\r\ncaution requisite in descending; for, on reaching the top of an\r\neminence, they stopped, and having placed their fore feet close\r\ntogether, as in a posture of stopping themselves, they also placed their\r\nhinder feet together a little forward, as if going to lie down. In this\r\nattitude, having, as it were, taken a survey of the road, they slid down\r\nwith great swiftness to the bottom. All the rider had to do, was to keep\r\nhimself fast in his saddle, without checking his beast; as the slightest\r\nmotion would have been sufficient to destroy its equilibrium, and both\r\nwould have inevitably perished. The address of the creatures was truly\r\nwonderful, for, in this rapid motion, when they seemed to have lost all\r\ngovernment of themselves, they followed exactly the different windings\r\nof the road, as if they had previously reconnoitered, and settled in\r\ntheir minds the route they were to follow, and taken every precaution\r\nfor their safety, amid so many irregularities. The safety of the rider\r\ndepended entirely on their experience and address; but, long as they had\r\nbeen accustomed to travel these roads, they seemed to feel a degree of\r\nhorror on reaching the top of a steep declivity. Without being checked\r\nby their rider, they stopped; and if he inadvertently endeavored to spur\r\nthem on, they were immovable until they had placed themselves in a\r\nsecure posture. They seemed as if they were actuated by reason; for they\r\nnot only viewed the road attentively, but trembled and snorted at the\r\ndanger; emotions which inspired the party with the most dreadful\r\napprehensions. The Indians went before, and, placing themselves along\r\nthe sides of the mountain, where they held by the roots of trees,\r\nanimated the beasts with shouts, until they at last started down the\r\ndeclivity.\r\n\r\nThere were some parts where the declivities were not on the side of the\r\nprecipices; but the road was so narrow and hollow, and the sides so\r\nnearly perpendicular, that the danger was almost equal. The track being\r\nextremely narrow, with scarcely a sufficient width of the road to admit\r\nthe mule with its rider, if the former had fallen, the latter would\r\nnecessarily have been crushed, and, for want of room to disengage\r\nhimself, would have been mutilated in his limbs, if he had escaped with\r\nlife. It was truly wonderful to consider with what exactness these\r\nanimals, after having overcome the first emotions of their fear, and\r\nwhen they were going to slide down the declivity, stretched out their\r\nfore-legs, to the end that they might preserve their equilibrium. The\r\ngentle inclination they made with the body, at a proper distance, in\r\nfollowing the several windings of the road, was also a mark of\r\nsurprising sagacity; and, lastly, their address in stopping themselves\r\nat the end of the impetuous career, was truly deserving of observation.\r\nGreater prudence and conduct could not have been exhibited by man!\r\n\r\n\r\n              -------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n                    GEOLOGICAL CHANGES OF THE EARTH.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  ------------------------------------\r\n\r\n           There are more things in heaven and earth\r\n           Than are dreamt of in our philosophy.—SHAKSPEARE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe variety of fossil substances, many of them marine productions, which\r\nare found in mountains remote from the sea, are undeniable proofs that\r\nthe earth’s surface has undergone considerable changes, some of which\r\nindicate an alteration of climate not easily to be explained. The\r\nremains of animals inhabiting hot countries, and the marine productions\r\nof hot climates, which are frequently found in high northern latitudes,\r\nlead to a suspicion that the earth’s axis was at a very remote period\r\ndifferently inclined from what it is at present. The tropics now extend\r\ntwenty-three degrees and a half on each side the equator; but if they\r\nwere extended to forty-five degrees, then the arctic circle and the\r\ntropics would coincide, and thence would arise inconceivable variations\r\nin the productions and phenomena of the earth. All this would form an\r\namusing speculation to a person possessed of a terrestrial globe, who\r\nmight tie a thread round it to represent the tropics at forty-five\r\ndegrees of elevation.\r\n\r\nBy the gradual operation of the sea and of rivers, the face of the globe\r\nhas, in the course of ages, undergone very material changes. The former\r\nhas encroached in particular parts, and retired from others; and the\r\nmouths of large rivers, running through low countries, have often been\r\nvariously modified, by a deposition and transfer of the matter washed\r\ndown from the land. At Havre, the sea undermines the steep coast; while\r\nit recedes at Dunkirk, where the shore is flat. In Holland the Zuyder\r\nZee was probably formed, in the middle ages, by continual irruptions of\r\nthe sea, where only the small lake Flevo had before existed. The mouths\r\nof the Rhine have been considerably altered, as well in their dimensions\r\nas in their directions. The mud, as it is deposited by large rivers,\r\ngenerally causes a _delta_, or a triangular piece of land, to grow out\r\ninto the sea. Thus the mouth of the Mississippi is said to have advanced\r\nabove fifty miles since the discovery of America. The island called\r\nSandy Hook, at the entrance of the harbor of New York, was formerly a\r\npeninsula attached to the main land. The old citizens of New Haven,\r\nConnecticut, point out places where once boats, and even small vessels,\r\nused to anchor, but which are now at quite a distance from the water and\r\ncovered with the dwellings of the inhabitants. Most of the large rivers\r\nof the United States are more or less changing their banks, and the\r\nplaces of their channels, from year to year. The sea, within the space\r\nof forty years, has retired more than a mile from Rosetta, in Egypt; and\r\nthe mouths of the Arno, and of the Rhone, consist in a great measure of\r\nnew land.\r\n\r\nThe Javanese have a tradition, that in former times the islands of\r\nSumatra, Java, Bali and Sumbawa, were united, and afterward separated\r\ninto nine different parts. They add, that when three thousand rainy\r\nseasons shall have passed away, they will be united. In the\r\nMediterranean, geological phenomena evince, that the island of Malta,\r\nand that of Gozo, its dependency, now separated by a wide channel, and\r\nthe intermediate small island of Cumino, formed, together with the\r\nlatter, a single island. By the encroachments of the sea, and the\r\nsubsidence of some parts of the land, the islands of Scilly, the\r\naboriginal inhabitants of which carried on a considerable trade in tin\r\nwith the Phenicians, Greeks and Romans, are now little more than barren\r\nrocks, with small patches of earth interspersed in the hollows. Strabo\r\ndescribes the Phenicians as having been so jealous of their lucrative\r\ntraffic with these islands, that they ran a vessel purposely on shore,\r\nand risked the lives of the crew, rather than have it made known to the\r\nRomans. The land within which these tin mines were worked, must now be\r\nsunk, and buried beneath the sea. On the shifting of the sands between\r\nthe islands, walls and ruins are frequently seen; the difference of\r\nlevel, since these walls or fences were made, to prevent the\r\nencroachments of the sea, being estimated at sixteen feet. There is\r\nlittle doubt but that there must have been a subsidence of the land,\r\nfollowed by a sudden inundation. This, indeed, seems to be confirmed by\r\ntradition, there being a strong persuasion in the western parts of\r\nCornwall, that there formerly existed a large country between the\r\nLand’s-end and the islands of Scilly, now laid many fathoms under water.\r\nAlthough there are no positive evidences of such an ancient connection\r\nbetween the main land and these islands, still it is extremely probable,\r\nthat the cause of the inundation which destroyed the greater part of\r\nthem, may have reached the Cornish shores, there being several proofs of\r\na subsidence of the land in Mount’s bay. The principal anchoring place,\r\nwhich was called a lake, is now a haven, or open harbor; and the mount,\r\nfrom its Cornish name, signifying _the gray rock in a wood_, must have\r\nformerly stood in a wood, but is now at full tide half a mile in the\r\nsea.\r\n\r\nExamples of a similar kind, relative to every known country, might be\r\nmultiplied. One of the most considerable inundations to be met with in\r\nhistory, is that which happened in the reign of Henry I. and which\r\noverflowed the estates of Earl Goodwin, forming the banks called the\r\nGoodwin or Godwin sands. In the year 1546, a similar irruption of the\r\nsea destroyed a hundred thousand persons in the territory of Dort, in\r\nthe United Provinces, and a still greater number round Dollart. In\r\nFriezland and Zealand more than three hundred villages were overwhelmed;\r\nand their remains are still visible, on a clear day, at the bottom of\r\nthe water. The Baltic sea has, by slow degrees, covered a large part of\r\nPomerania; and, among others, overwhelmed the famous port of Vineta. The\r\nNorwegian sea has formed several little islands from the main land, and\r\nstill daily advances on the continent. The German sea has advanced on\r\nthe shores of Holland, near Catt, to such a degree, that the ruins of an\r\nancient citadel of the Romans, formerly built on that coast, are now\r\nunder water. The country surrounding the isle of Ely was, in the time of\r\nBede, about a thousand years ago, one of the most delightful and highly\r\ncultivated spots in Great Britain: it was overwhelmed, and remained for\r\nseveral centuries under the water, until at length, the sea, by a\r\ncaprice similar to the one which had prompted its invasions, abandoned\r\nthe earth, but without the latter being able to recover its primitive\r\nstate, that of one of the most fertile valleys in the world.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the sea has in many instances, deserted the land; and\r\nby the deposition of its sediment in some places, and the accumulation\r\nof its sands in others, has also formed new lands. In this manner the\r\nisle of Oxney, near Romney marsh, was produced. In France, the town of\r\nAigues Mortes, which was a seaport in the time of Louis IX., is now\r\nremoved more than four miles from the sea. Psalmodi, also in that\r\nkingdom, was an island in the year 815, and is now upward of six miles\r\nwithin the land. In Italy, a considerable portion of land has been\r\ngained at the mouth of the river Arno; and Ravenna, which once stood by\r\nthe sea-side, is now between four and five miles from it. Every part of\r\nHolland seems to be a conquest from the sea, and to have been rescued,\r\nin a manner, from its bosom. The industry of man, however, in the\r\nformation of dikes, is here to be brought into account; for the surface\r\nof the earth, in that country, is for the greater part below the surface\r\nof the sea.\r\n\r\nThree-fifths of the surface of the globe are covered by the sea, the\r\naverage depth of which has been estimated at from five to ten miles.\r\nDemonstrative proofs exist in Great Britain, and in various parts of the\r\nworld, that great changes have taken place in the relative positions of\r\nthe present continents with the ocean, which, in former ages, rolled its\r\nwaves over the summits of our present elevated mountains. To illustrate\r\nthis subject, and before these proofs are entered on, in the\r\nconsideration of the geological phenomena named extraneous fossils, it\r\nwill be proper to introduce the pleasing and truly philosophical view of\r\nthe successive changes the earth has undergone, contained in Sir Richard\r\nPhillips’s Morning Walk to Kew. In passing near the banks of the Thames,\r\nSir Richard was led, in two several places, to introduce the following\r\nobservations and reflections on this highly curious and interesting\r\nsubject. They apply the principles and facts of geology in a way in\r\nwhich they may be applied to any river, and indicate how much we are\r\ndaily surrounded by the wonders of creation, the process of which, as\r\nSir Richard observes, is _never ceasing_. In passing over the alluvial\r\nflat of Barnes common, he introduces the following thoughts, which are\r\ngiven in very nearly his own language.\r\n\r\n“On this common, nature still appears to be in a primeval and unfinished\r\nstate. The entire flat from the high ground to the Thames, is evidently\r\na mere fresh-water formation, of comparatively modern date, created out\r\nof the rocky ruins which the rains, in a series of ages, have washed\r\nfrom the high grounds, and further augmented by the decay of local\r\nvegetation. The adjacent high lands, being elevated above the action of\r\nthe fresh water, were no doubt marine formations, created by the flowing\r\nof the sea during the long period when the earth was last in its\r\nperihelion during our summer months; which was probably thousands of\r\nyears since. The flat, or freshwater formation, on which I was walking,\r\nstill only approaches its completion; and the desiccated soil has not\r\nyet fully defined the boundaries of the river. At spring-tides,\r\nparticularly when the line of the moon’s apsides coincides with the\r\nsyzygies, or when the ascending node is in the vernal equinox, or after\r\nheavy rains, the river still overflows its banks, and indicates its\r\noriginally extended site under ordinary circumstances.\r\n\r\n“The state of transition also appears in marshes, bogs and ponds, which,\r\nbut for the interference of man, would, many ages ago, have been filled\r\nup with decayed forests and the remains of undisturbed vegetation.\r\nRivers thus become agents of the _never-ceasing creation_, and a means\r\nof giving greater equality to the face of the land. The sea as it\r\nretired, either abruptly from some situations, or gradually from others,\r\nleft dry land, consisting of downs and swelling hills, disposed in all\r\nthe variety which would be consequential on a succession of floods and\r\nebbs during several thousand years. These downs, acted upon by rain,\r\nwere mechanically, or in solution, carried off by the water to the\r\nlowest levels, the elevations being thereby depressed, and the valleys\r\nproportionally raised. The low lands became, of course, the channels\r\nthrough which the rains returned to the sea, and the successive deposits\r\non their sides, hardened by the wind and sun, have in five or six\r\nthousand years, created such tracts of alluvial soil, as those which now\r\npresent themselves in contiguity with most rivers. The soil, thus\r\nassembled and compounded, is similar in its nature to the rocks and\r\nhills whence it was washed; but, having been so pulverized, and so\r\ndivided by solution, it forms the finest medium for the secretion of all\r\nvegetable principles, and hence the banks of the rivers are the favorite\r\nresidences of man. Should the channel constantly narrow itself more and\r\nmore, till it becomes choked in its course, or at its outlet, then, for\r\na time, lakes would be formed, which, in like manner, would narrow\r\nthemselves and disappear. New channels would then be formed, or the rain\r\nwould so diffuse itself over the surface, that the fall and the\r\nevaporation would balance each other.\r\n\r\n“Such are the unceasing works of _creation_, constantly taking place on\r\nthe exterior surface of the earth; where, though less evident to the\r\nsenses and experience of man, matter apparently inert is in as\r\nprogressive a state of change, from the operation of unceasing and\r\nimmutable causes, as in the visible generations of the animal and\r\nvegetable kingdoms. Thus water, wind and heat, the energies of which\r\nnever cease to be exerted, are constantly producing new combinations,\r\nchanges and creations; which, if they accord with the harmony of the\r\nwhole, are fit and ‘good;’ but, if discordant, are speedily re-organized\r\nor extinguished by contrary and opposing powers. In a word, _whatever\r\nis, is fit; and whatever is not fit, is not, or soon ceases to be_! Such\r\nseems to be the governing principle of Nature, the key of all her\r\nmysteries, the primary law of creation! All things are the proximate\r\neffects of a balance of immutable powers; those powers are results of a\r\n_primordial cause_; while that _cause_ is inscrutable and\r\nincomprehensible to creatures possessing but a relative being, who live\r\nonly in _time_ and _space_, and who feel and act merely by the _impulse_\r\nof limited senses and powers.”\r\n\r\nAnd, again, the same writer introduces the following apposite remarks on\r\nthis very interesting subject.\r\n\r\n“As I approached a sequestered mansion-house, and the other buildings\r\nconnected with it, I crossed a corner of the meadow toward an angle\r\nformed by a rude inlet of the Thames, which was running smoothly toward\r\nthe sea, at the rate of four miles an hour. The tide unites here with\r\nthe ordinary current, and running a few miles above this place, exhibits\r\ntwice a day the finely reduced edge of that physical balance-wheel, or\r\noscillating fluid-pendulum, which creates the earth’s centrifugal power,\r\nand varies the center of its forces. In viewing the beautiful process of\r\nnature, presented by a majestic river, we cease to wonder that\r\npriestcraft has often succeeded in teaching nations to consider rivers\r\nof divine origin, and as proximate living emblems of omnipotence.\r\nIgnorance, whose constant error is to look only to the last term of\r\nevery series of causes, and which charges impiety on all who venture to\r\nascend one term higher, and atheism on all who dare to explore several\r\nterms, (though every series implies a first term,) would easily be\r\npersuaded by a crafty priesthood to consider a beneficent river as a\r\ntangible branch of the Godhead. But we now know that the waters which\r\nflow down a river, are but a portion of the rains and snows which,\r\nhaving fallen near its source, are returning to the ocean, there to rise\r\nagain and re-perform the same circle of vapors, clouds, rains and\r\nrivers. What a process of fertilization, and how still more luxuriant\r\nwould have been this vicinity, if man had not leveled the trees, and\r\ncarried away the crops of vegetation. What a place of shelter would thus\r\nhave been afforded to tribes of amphibiæ, whose accumulated remains\r\noften surprise geologists, though necessarily consequent on the fall of\r\ncrops of vegetation on each other, near undisturbed banks of rivers.\r\nHappily, in Britain, our coal-pits, or mineralized forests, have\r\nsupplied the place of our living woods; or man, regardless of the\r\nfitness of all the parts to the perfection of every natural result,\r\nmight here, as in other long-peopled countries, ignorantly have thwarted\r\nthe course of nature by cutting down the timber, which, acting on the\r\nelectricity of the clouds, affects their destiny, and causes them to\r\nfall in fertilizing showers. Such has been the fate of all the countries\r\nfamous in antiquity. Persia, Syria, Arabia, parts of Turkey, and the\r\nBarbary coast, have been rendered arid deserts by this inadvertency. The\r\nclouds from the Western ocean would long since have passed over England\r\nwithout disturbance from the conducting power of leaves of trees, or\r\nblades of grass, if our coal-works had not saved our natural conductors;\r\nwhile the Thames, the agent of so much abundance and of so much wealth,\r\nmight, in that case, have become a shallow brook, like the once equally\r\nfamed Jordan, Granicus, or Ilyssus.\r\n\r\n“I now descended toward a rude space near the river, which appeared to\r\nbe in the state in which the occasional overflowings and gradual\r\nretrocession of the river had left it. It was one of those wastes which\r\nthe lord of the manor had not yet enabled some industrious cultivator to\r\ndisguise; and in large tracts of which Great Britain still exhibits the\r\nsurface of the earth in the pristine state in which it was left by the\r\nsecondary causes that have given it form. The Thames, doubtless, in a\r\nremote age, covered the entire site; but it is the tendency of rivers to\r\nnarrow themselves, by promoting prolific vegetable creations on their\r\nconsequently increasing and encroaching banks, though the various\r\ndegrees of fall produce every variety of currents, and, consequently,\r\nevery variety of banks, in their devious course. In due time, the course\r\nof the river becomes choked where a flat succeeds a rapid, and the\r\ndetained waters then form lakes in the interior. These lakes likewise\r\ngenerate encroaching banks, which finally fill up their basins, when new\r\nrivers are formed on higher levels. These in their turn, become\r\ninterrupted, and repetitions of the former circle of causes produce one\r\nclass of those elevations of land above the level of the sea, which have\r\nso much puzzled geologists. The only condition which a surface of dry\r\nland requires to increase and raise itself, is the absence of salt\r\nwater, consequent on which is an accumulation of vegetable and animal\r\nremains. The Thames has not latterly been allowed to produce its natural\r\neffects, because for two thousand years the banks have been inhabited by\r\nman, who unable to appreciate the general laws by which the phenomena of\r\nthe earth are produced, has sedulously kept open the course of the\r\nriver, and prevented the formation of interior lakes. The Caspian sea,\r\nand all similar inland seas and lakes, were, for the most part, formed\r\nfrom the choking up of rivers which once constituted their outlets. If\r\nthe course of nature be not interrupted by the misdirected industry of\r\nman, the gradual desiccation of all such collections of water will, in\r\ndue time, produce land of higher levels on their sites. In like manner,\r\nthe great lakes of North America, if the St. Lawrence be not sedulously\r\nkept open, will in the course of ages, be filled up by the gradual\r\nencroachment of their banks, and the raising of their bottoms with\r\nstrata of vegetable and animal remains. New rivers would then flow over\r\nthese increased elevations, and the ultimate effect would be to raise\r\nthat part of the continent of North America several hundred feet above\r\nits present level. Even the very place on which I stand was, according\r\nto Webster, once a vast basin, extending from the Nore to near Reading,\r\nbut now filled up with vegetable and animal remains; and the illustrious\r\nCuvier has discovered a similar basin round the site of Paris. These\r\nonce were Caspians, created by the choking and final disappearance of\r\nsome mighty rivers; they have been filled up by gradual encroachments,\r\nand now the Thames and the Seine flow over them; but these, if left to\r\nthemselves, will, in their turn, generate new lakes or basins, and the\r\nsuccessive recurrence of a similar series of causes will continue to\r\nproduce similar effects, till interrupted by _superior_ causes.\r\n\r\n“This situation was so sequestered, and therefore so favorable to\r\ncontemplation, that I could not avoid indulging myself. What, then, are\r\nthose superior causes, I exclaimed, which will interrupt this series of\r\nnatural operations to which man is indebted for the enchanting visions\r\nof hill and dale, and for the elysium of beauty and plenty in which he\r\nfinds himself? Alas! facts prove that all things are transitory, and\r\nthat change of condition is the constant and necessary result of that\r\nmotion which is the chief instrument of eternal causation, but which, in\r\ncausing all phenomena, wears out existing organizations while it is\r\ngenerating new ones. In the motions of the earth as a planet, doubtless\r\nare to be discovered the superior causes which convert seas into\r\ncontinents, and continents into seas. These sublime changes are\r\noccasioned by the progress of the perihelion point of the earth’s orbit\r\nthrough the ecliptic, which passes from extreme northern to extreme\r\nsouthern declination, and _vice versa_, every ten thousand, four hundred\r\nand fifty years; and the maxima of the central forces in the perihelion\r\noccasion the waters to accumulate alternately upon either hemisphere.\r\nDuring ten thousand, four hundred and fifty years, the sea is therefore\r\ngradually retiring and encroaching in both hemispheres: hence all the\r\nvarieties of marine appearances and accumulations of marine remains in\r\nparticular situations; and hence the successions of layers or strata,\r\none upon another, of marine and earthly remains. It is evident, from\r\nobservation of those strata, that the periodical changes have occurred\r\nat least three times; or in other words, it appears that the site on\r\nwhich I now stand has been three times covered by the ocean, and three\r\ntimes has afforded an asylum for vegetables and animals! How sublime,\r\nhow interesting, how affecting is such a contemplation! How transitory,\r\ntherefore, must be the local arrangements of man, and how puerile the\r\nstudy of the science miscalled antiquities! How foolish the pride which\r\nvaunts itself on splendid buildings and costly mausoleums! How vain the\r\nostentation of large estates, of extensive boundaries, and of great\r\nempires! All, all will, in due time, be swept away and defaced by the\r\nunsparing ocean; and, if recorded in the frail memorials of human\r\nscience, will be spoken of like the lost Atlantis, and remembered only\r\nas a philosophical dream!”\r\n\r\nSuch are the speculations of Phillips, containing many things highly\r\ninteresting and instructive; though, with our advanced knowledge of\r\ngeology, we involuntarily smile at his “_periods_” of “_ten thousand,\r\nfour hundred and fifty years_,” knowing, as we now do, that some of the\r\ngreat changes of which he speaks must have occupied the long ages of the\r\nearth’s chaotic state, before God, by his word, formed it again to life\r\nand order and beauty. The merest tyro in science now knows, that in the\r\ngreat facts of geology God as truly speaks by his _works_, as in the\r\nbook of revelation he speaks by his _word_; and though we are far more\r\nliable to misunderstand and misinterpret the former than the latter, yet\r\n_rightly_ understood there is no discrepancy between the two, but both\r\nspeak the same language of truth. In the very structure of the earth\r\nitself, we have the evidence of the changes it has passed through. The\r\nwonderful wrecks of a former state of nature, preserved, like ancient\r\nmedals or marbles in the ruins of an extinct empire, tell of the\r\nprogress of the earth in past ages, and teach us that many of the\r\nchanges which Phillips would refer to comparatively modern times, belong\r\nto a period far back of the creation of our first parents, when our\r\nplanet, though existing, had not as yet been prepared for the habitation\r\nof mankind. We will not, however, dwell on these points; but merely\r\nallude to them, referring our readers to any of the elementary treatises\r\non geology, where they may find the full details of facts, and also the\r\nvarious theories which reconcile these facts with the statements of the\r\nMosaic history.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          EXTRANEOUS FOSSILS.\r\n\r\nThe fossil remains of animals not now in existence, entombed and\r\npreserved in solid rocks, present us with durable monuments of the great\r\nchanges which our planet has undergone in former ages. We are led to a\r\nperiod when the waters of the primitive ocean must have covered the\r\nsummits of our highest mountains, and are irresistibly compelled to\r\nadmit one of two conclusions: either that the sea has retired, and sunk\r\nbeneath its former level; or that some power, operating from beneath,\r\nhas lifted up the islands and continents, with all their hills and\r\nmountains, from the watery abyss to their present elevation above its\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\nThe calcareous, or limestone mountains in Derbyshire, and at Craven, in\r\nYorkshire, having an elevation of about two thousand feet above the\r\npresent level of the sea, contain, in a greater or less abundance, and\r\nthroughout their whole extent, fossil remains of zoophytes, shell-fish,\r\nand marine animals. No remains of vegetables have been found in the\r\ncalcareous mountains of England; but, in the thick beds of shale and\r\ngritstone lying upon them, are found various vegetable impressions, and\r\nabove these regular beds of coal, with strata, containing shells of\r\nfresh-water mussels. In the earthy limestone of the upper strata are\r\nsometimes found fossil flat-fish, with the impression of the scales and\r\nbones quite distinct. The mountains of the Pyrenees are covered in the\r\nhighest part, at Mont Perdu, with calcareous rocks, containing\r\nimpressions of marine animals; and, even where the impressions are not\r\nvisible in the limestone, it yields a fetid cadaverous odor, when\r\ndissolved in acids, owing, in all probability, to the animal matters it\r\ncontains. Mont Perdu, which rises ten thousand five hundred feet, or\r\nabout two miles above the level of the sea, is the highest situation in\r\nwhich any marine remains have been found in Europe. In the Andes they\r\nhave been observed by Humboldt at the hight of fourteen thousand feet,\r\nmore than two miles and a half. Lastly, in southern countries, in and\r\nunder beds of clay-covering chalk, the bones of the elephant, and of the\r\nrhinoceros are frequently found.\r\n\r\nThese bones, as they have been brought from different parts of the\r\nworld, have been examined with the utmost attention by the sagacious\r\nnaturalist Cuvier. He has observed characteristic variations of\r\nstructure, which prove that they belong to animals not now existing on\r\nour globe: nor have many of the various zoöphytes and shell-fish, found\r\nin calcareous rocks, been discovered in our present seas. From these\r\nvery curious facts he makes the following deductions.\r\n\r\n“These bones are buried, almost everywhere, in nearly similar beds: they\r\nare often blended with some other animals resembling those of the\r\npresent day. The beds are generally loose, either sandy or marly; and\r\nalways neighboring, more or less, to the surface. It is, then, probable\r\nthat these bones have been enveloped by the last, or by one of the last,\r\ncatastrophes of this globe. In a great number of places they are\r\naccompanied by the accumulated remains of marine animals; but in some\r\nplaces, which are less numerous, there are none of these remains:\r\nsometimes the sand or marl, which covers them, contains only fresh-water\r\nshells. No well authenticated account proves that they have been covered\r\nby regular beds of stone, filled with sea-shells; and, consequently,\r\nthat the sea has remained on them undisturbed, for a long period. The\r\ncatastrophe which covered them was, therefore, a great, but transient,\r\ninundation of the sea. This inundation did not rise above the high\r\nmountains; for we find no analogous deposits covering the bones, nor are\r\nthe bones themselves there met with, not even in the high valleys,\r\nunless in some of the warmer parts of America. These bones are neither\r\nrolled nor joined in a skeleton, but scattered, and in part fractured.\r\nThey have not, then, been brought from afar by inundation, but found by\r\nit in places where it has covered them, as might be expected, if the\r\nanimals to which they belonged had dwelt in these places, and had there\r\nsuccessively died. Before this catastrophe, these animals lived,\r\ntherefore, in the climates in which we now dig up their bones: it was\r\nthis catastrophe which destroyed them there; and, as we no longer find\r\nthem, it is evident that it has annihilated those species. The northern\r\nparts of the globe, therefore, nourished formerly, species belonging to\r\nthe genus _elephant_, _hippopotamus_, _rhinoceros_, and _tapir_, as well\r\nas to that of the _mastodon_; genera of which the four first have no\r\nlonger any species existing, except in the torrid zone; and the last,\r\nnone in any part.”\r\n\r\nThe researches of Dr. Buckland, connected with the kind of relics of\r\nwhich we are speaking, have given them additional interest, especially\r\nas connected with certain points of diluvial geology, and with their\r\nassemblage in caverns. In these caverns, the bones are usually found\r\nmixed with mud, stones and fragments; and circumstances seem to show\r\nthat the animals resided in them for a great length of time. The\r\ncelebrated Kirkdale cavern, in Yorkshire, discovered in 1821, contains\r\nthe remains of the hyena, tiger, bear, wolf, fox, weasel, elephant,\r\nrhinoceros, hippopotamus, horse, ox, deer, hare, rabbit, rat, mouse,\r\nraven, pigeon, lark, thrush, and a species of duck. From the mode in\r\nwhich these remains were strewed over the bottom of the cavern, from the\r\ngreat proportion of hyenas’ teeth over those of other animals, and from\r\nthe manner in which many of the bones were gnawed and fractured, Dr.\r\nBuckland infers that this cavern was the den of hyenas for a long\r\nsuccession of years; that they brought in as their prey, the animals\r\nwhose remains are thus mixed with their own; and that this state of\r\nthings was suddenly terminated by an irruption of turbid water into the\r\ncave, which buried the whole in the mud in which they are now\r\nintermingled. In other cases, the bones of other animals have been\r\nfound, indicating the same general facts as to the existence of animals\r\nnow no longer known in the same latitudes.\r\n\r\nThat every part of the dry land was once covered by the ocean, is a fact\r\non which all geologists agree; and the discovery, noticed above, of the\r\nfossil remains of many genera of quadrupeds, once existing, but which\r\nhave now disappeared from the earth, leads to another fact, not less\r\ninteresting, and which is at the same time coincident with the oldest\r\nrecords or traditions of the human race, namely, that at the period when\r\nthese great changes took place, man was not an inhabitant of the planet.\r\nThese fossil remains, now about to be particularized, are among the most\r\nsurprising of nature’s phenomena, and irresistibly lead to most\r\ninteresting speculations respecting the past and future condition of the\r\nterrestrial globe.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           FOSSIL CROCODILES.\r\n\r\nThe fossil remains of crocodiles have been collected in the neighborhood\r\nof Honfleur, on the coast of France, and were found in a bed of hard\r\nlimestone, of a bluish gray color, which becomes nearly black when wet,\r\nand which is found along the shore on both sides of the mouth of the\r\nSeine, being in some places covered by the sea, and in others, above its\r\nlevel, even at high water. Remains of crocodiles have also been found in\r\nother parts of France; as at Angers and Mans. Some of these remains seem\r\nto show, that at least one of the fossil species above noticed is also\r\nfound in other parts of France besides Honfleur.\r\n\r\nThe remains of crocodiles have been also found in different parts of\r\nEngland; but particularly on the coast of Dorsetshire, and of Yorkshire\r\nnear Whitby, in the neighborhood of Bath, and near Newark in\r\nNottinghamshire. Somersetshire, particularly in the neighborhood of\r\nBath, the cliffs on the Dorsetshire, or southern coast, and on the\r\nYorkshire, or northern coast, are the places in this island in which the\r\nremains of the animals of this tribe have been chiefly found. The matrix\r\nin which they are found is in general similar to that which has been\r\nalready mentioned as containing the fossils of Honfleur, a blue\r\nlimestone, becoming almost black when wet. This description exactly\r\nagrees with the limestone of Charmouth, Lime, &c., in Dorsetshire, on\r\nthe opposite coast to that of France on which Honfleur is situated. At\r\nWhitby and Scarborough, where these fossils are also found, the stone is\r\nindeed somewhat darker than in the former places; but no difference is\r\nobservable which can be regarded as offering any forcible opposition to\r\nthe probability of the original identity of this stratum, which is\r\nobserved on the northern coast of France, on the opposite southern\r\nEnglish coast, and at the opposite northern extremity of the island.\r\nSome of these remains are also found in quarries of common coarse gray\r\nand whitish limestone. Instances of this kind of matrix, for these\r\nremains, are observable in the quarries between Bath and Bristol. The\r\nRev. Mr. Hawker, of Woodchester, in Gloucestershire, formerly had in his\r\npossession, perhaps one of the handsomest specimens of the remains of\r\nthe crocodile discovered in all England. It was found by him in the\r\nneighborhood of Bath, and contained a great part of the head and of the\r\ntrunk of the animal.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   LARGE FOSSIL ANIMAL OF MAESTRICHT.\r\n\r\nThe large animal, whose fossil remains are found in the quarries of\r\nMaestricht, has been deservedly a frequent object of admiration; and the\r\nbeautiful appearance which its remains possess, in consequence of their\r\nexcellent state of preservation, in a matrix which admits of their fair\r\ndisplay, has occasioned every specimen of this fossil to be highly\r\nvalued. The lower jaw of this animal, and some other specimens, which\r\nwere presented by Dr. Peter Camper to the Royal Society, and which are\r\nnow in the British museum, are among the most splendid and interesting\r\nfossils in existence. In 1770, the workmen having discovered part of an\r\nenormous head of an animal imbedded in the solid stone, in one of the\r\nsubterraneous passages of the mountain, gave information to M. Hoffman,\r\nwho, with the most zealous assiduity, labored until he had disengaged\r\nthis astonishing fossil from its matrix. But when this was done, the\r\nfruits of his labors were wrested from him by an ecclesiastic, who\r\nclaimed it as being proprietor of the land over the spot on which it was\r\nfound. Hoffman defended his right in a court of justice; but through the\r\ninfluence employed against him, he was doomed not only to the loss of\r\nthis inestimable fossil, but to the payment of heavy law expenses. But\r\nin time, justice, though tardy, at last arrived; the troops of the\r\nFrench republic secured this treasure, which was conveyed to the\r\nnational museum.\r\n\r\nThe length of the cervical, dorsal and lumbar vertebrae, appears to have\r\nbeen about nine feet five inches, and that of the vertebræ of the tail\r\nabout ten foot; adding to which the length of the head, which may be\r\nreckoned, considering the loss of the intermaxillary bones, at least at\r\nfour feet, we may safely conclude the whole length of the skeleton of\r\nthe animal to have approached very nearly to twenty-four feet. The head\r\nis a sixth of the whole length of the animal; a proportion approaching\r\nvery near to that of the crocodile, but differing much from that of the\r\nmonitor, the head of which animal forms hardly a twelfth part of the\r\nwhole length. The tail must have been very strong, and its width, at its\r\nextremity, must have rendered it a most powerful oar, and have enabled\r\nthe animal to have opposed the most agitated waters, as has been well\r\nremarked by naturalists who have examined it. From this circumstance,\r\nand from the other remains which accompany those of this animal, there\r\ncan be no doubt of its having been an inhabitant of the ocean. Taking\r\nall these circumstances into consideration, M. Cuvier concludes, and\r\ncertainly on fair, if not indisputable grounds, that this animal must\r\nhave formed an intermediate genus between those animals of the lizard\r\ntribe which have an extensive and forked tongue, which include the\r\nmonitors and the common lizards, and those which have a short tongue and\r\nthe palate armed with teeth, which comprise the iguanas, marbres, and\r\nanolis. This genus, he thinks, could only have been allied to the\r\ncrocodile by the general characters of the lizards.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     FOSSIL REMAINS OF RUMINANTIA.\r\n\r\nAmong the fossils of the British empire, none are more calculated to\r\nexcite astonishment than the enormous stags’ horns which have been dug\r\nup in different parts of Ireland. Their dimensions, as given by Dr.\r\nMolyneux, are as follows.\r\n\r\n                                                        Feet.  Inch.\r\n    From the extreme tip of each horn,                     10     10\r\n    From the tip of the right horn to its root,             5      2\r\n    From the tip of one of the inner branches to the\r\n      tip of the   opposite branch,                         3     7½\r\n    The length of one of the palms, within the\r\n      branches,                                             2      5\r\n    The breadth of the same palm within the branches,       1    10½\r\n    The length of the right brow antler,                    1      2\r\n\r\nA similar pair, found ten feet under ground, in the county of Clare, was\r\npresented to Charles II. and placed in the horn-gallery, Hampton Court;\r\nbut was afterward removed into the guard-room of the same palace. At\r\nBallyward, near Ballyshannon; at Turvey, eight miles from Dublin; and at\r\nPortumery, near the river Shannon, in the county of Galway, similar\r\nhorns have been found. In the common-hall of the Bishop of Armagh’s\r\nhouse, in Dublin, was a forehead, with two amazingly large beams of a\r\npair of this kind of horns, which, from the magnitude of the beams, must\r\nhave much exceeded in size those of which the dimensions are given\r\nabove. Dr. Molyneux states, that in the last twenty years, thirty pair\r\nof these horns had been dug up by accident in the country: the\r\nobservations, also, of several other persons, prove the great frequency\r\nwith which these remains have been found in Ireland. Various opinions\r\nhave been entertained respecting this animal and its existing prototype.\r\nThis, however, does not appear to have been yet discovered; and these\r\nremains may, therefore, be regarded as having belonged to an animal now\r\nextinct.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      FOSSIL REMAINS OF ELEPHANTS.\r\n\r\nNumerous remains of elephants have been found in Italy; and, although a\r\nvery considerable number of elephants were brought from Africa into that\r\ncountry, yet the vast extent through which these remains have been\r\nfound, and the great probability that the Italians, particularly the\r\nRomans, would have known enough of the value of ivory, to have prevented\r\nthem from committing the tusks to the earth, lead to the belief, that by\r\nfar the greater number of these remains which have been dug up, have\r\nbeen deposited here, not by the hands of man, but by the changes that\r\nthe surface of this globe has undergone, at very remote periods. The\r\ncircumstances, indeed, under which many of these have been found, afford\r\nindubitable proof of this fact.\r\n\r\nIn France, where it is well known that living elephants have been much\r\nless frequent, at least in times of which we have any record, than\r\neither in Italy or Greece, their fossil remains have been found in a\r\ngreat number of places, and in situations which prove their deposition\r\nat a very remote period. The whole valley through which the Rhine\r\npasses, yields fragments of this animal, and perhaps more numerously on\r\nthe side of Germany than on that of France. Not only in its course, but\r\nin the alluvia of the several streams which empty themselves into it,\r\nare these fossil remains also found. Thus Holland abounds with them, and\r\neven the most elevated parts of the Batavian kingdom are not exempt from\r\nthem. Germany and Switzerland appear particularly to abound in these\r\nwonderful relics. The greater number found in these parts, is, perhaps,\r\nas is observed by M. Cuvier, not attributable to their greater\r\nabundance, but to the number of well-informed men, capable of making the\r\nnecessary researches, and of reporting the interesting facts they\r\ndiscover. As in the banks of the Rhine, so in those of the Danube, these\r\nfossils abound. In the valley of Altmuhl is a grand deposit of these\r\nremains. The bones which have been found at Krembs, in Sweden; at Baden,\r\nnear Vienna; in Moravia; in different parts of Hungary and of\r\nTransylvania; at the foot of the Hartz; in Hesse; at Hildesheim—all\r\nappear to be referable to this animal. So also are those which are found\r\non the Elbe, the Oder, and the Vistula. Different parts of the British\r\nempire are not less productive of these remains. In London, Brentford,\r\nHarwich, Norwich, Gloucestershire, Staffordshire, Warwickshire,\r\nSalisbury, and, indeed, in several other parts of Great Britain,\r\ndifferent remains of these animals have been found. When we add to those\r\nplaces which have been already enumerated, Scandinavia, Norway, Iceland,\r\nRussia, Siberia, Tunis, parts of North America, and Ibarra, in the\r\nnorthern part of Equador, it will appear that there is hardly a part in\r\nthe known world, whose subterranean productions are known to us, in\r\nwhich these animal remains have not been discovered. M. Cuvier is\r\nsatisfied, from the actual comparison of several skulls of the\r\nEast-Indian and African elephants, that different specific characters\r\nexist in them respectively. In the Indian elephant, the top of the skull\r\nis raised in a kind of double pyramid; but in the African it is nearly\r\nrounded. In the Indian the forehead is concave, and in the African it is\r\nrather convex. Several other differences exist, not necessary to be here\r\nparticularized, which seem to be fully sufficient to mark a difference\r\nof species. A cursory view is sufficient to enable us to determine that\r\nthe ordinary fossil teeth of elephants are not those of the African\r\nspecies, and it may be further said, that the greater number of these\r\nteeth bear a close resemblance to those of the East-Indian species,\r\nshowing, on their masticating surface, bands of an equal thickness\r\nthrough their whole length, and rudely crenulated. So great, indeed, is\r\nthe resemblance, that Pallas, and most other writers, have considered\r\nthe fossil elephant as being of the same species with the Asiatic. M.\r\nCuvier, anxious to discover the degree of accordance of the fossil\r\nelephant’s skeleton with that of the living species, compared the fossil\r\nskull, found in Siberia by Messerschmidt, with those of the African and\r\nAsiatic elephants. The result of his comparison was, that in the fossil\r\nspecies the alveoli of the tusks are much longer; the zygomatic arch is\r\nof a different figure; the post-orbital apophysis of the frontal bone is\r\nlonger, more pointed, and more crooked; and the tubercle of the os\r\nlachrymalis is considerably larger, and more projecting. To these\r\npeculiarities of the fossil skull, M. Cuvier thinks, may be added the\r\nparallelism of the molares. Comparing together the bones of the Asiatic\r\nand of the African elephant, he was able to discover some differences\r\nbetween them, as well as between those and some of the fossil bones\r\nwhich he possessed. These latter he found, in general, approached\r\nnearest to those of the Asiatic elephant. He concludes with supposing\r\nthat the fossil remains are of a species differing more widely from the\r\nAsiatic elephant than the horse does from the ass, and therefore does\r\nnot think it impossible but that it might have existed in a climate that\r\nwould have destroyed the elephant of India.\r\n\r\nIt may, therefore, be assumed as certain, from the observations of M.\r\nCuvier, that at least one species of elephants has existed, of which\r\nnone are now known to be living; and, should the difference of structure\r\nwhich has been pointed out in some of the fossil teeth, be admitted as\r\nsufficient to designate a difference of species, it may be then said,\r\nthat there exist the fossil remains of, at least, two species of\r\nelephants, which were different from those with which we are acquainted.\r\nFrom the preceding observations it appears, then, that the fossil\r\nelephantine remains, notwithstanding their resemblance in some respects\r\nto the bones of the Asiatic elephant, have belonged to one or more\r\nspecies, different from those which are now known. This circumstance\r\nagrees with the facts of the fossil remains of the tapir and rhinoceros,\r\nwhich appear to have differed materially from the living animals of the\r\nsame genera. The remains of elephants obtained from Essex, Middlesex,\r\nKent, and other parts of England, confirm the observation of Cuvier,\r\nthat these remains are generally found in the looser and more\r\nsuperficial parts of the earth, and most frequently in the alluvia which\r\nfill the bottoms of the valleys, or which border the beds of rivers.\r\nThey are generally found mingled with the bones of other quadrupeds of\r\nknown genera, such as those of the rhinoceros, ox, horse, &c., and\r\nfrequently, also, with the remains of marine animals.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    FOSSIL REMAINS OF THE MASTODON.\r\n\r\nWe now come to the examination of one of the most stupendous animals\r\nknown, either in a recent or a fossil state; one which, whether we\r\ncontemplate its original mode of existence, or the period at which it\r\nlived, can not but fill our minds with astonishment. The first traces of\r\nthis animal are sketched in a letter from Dr. Mather, of Boston, to Dr.\r\nWoodward, in 1712, and are transcribed from a work in manuscript,\r\nentitled _Biblia Americana_. In this work, teeth and bones of prodigious\r\nsize, supposed to be human, are said to have been found near what is now\r\nAlbany, in the state of New York. About the year 1740, numerous similar\r\nbones were found in Kentucky, on the Ohio, and were dispersed among the\r\nEuropean virtuosi. Many bones of this animal were found, in 1799, in the\r\nstate of New York, in a large plain, bounded on every side by immense\r\nmountains, in the vicinity of Newburg, situated on the Hudson or North\r\nriver. These remains have also been found on the side of the Alleghany\r\nmountains, in the interior parts of Pennsylvania and Carolina, and in\r\nNew Jersey, not far from Philadelphia. And quite lately (1854) the tusks\r\nof a mastodon, apparently of enormous size, were discovered protruding\r\nfrom the inclined side of a marshy declivity, a few miles from the city\r\nof Poughkeepsie. Measures were immediately taken to excavate the place\r\nand exhume the skeleton. We are informed that the work thus far has been\r\nremarkably successful, and the condition of the skeleton such as to\r\npromise the security of the most perfect specimen of the mastodon ever\r\nfound. The location is extremely favorable. The excavation, which is\r\nprosecuted under the direction of Professor Morse, the discoverer of the\r\nmagnetic telegraph, who resides at Poughkeepsie, has succeeded as far as\r\nthe head and shoulders of the mammoth. The bones are partially petrified\r\nas far as the exhumation has extended, and this promises the recovery of\r\nthe entire skeleton in a more perfect state than any yet discovered. If\r\nour information is correct, and it emanates from an entirely responsible\r\nsource, an object of great interest will be added to the science and\r\nstudy of natural history.\r\n\r\nFrom a careful attendance to every circumstance, M. Cuvier conceives we\r\nhave a right to conclude, that this great mastodon, or animal of the\r\nOhio, did not surpass the elephant in hight, but was a little longer in\r\nproportion, its limbs rather thicker, and its belly smaller. It seems to\r\nhave very much resembled the elephant in its tusks, and, indeed, in the\r\nwhole of its osteology; and it also appears to have had a trunk. But,\r\nnotwithstanding its resemblance to the elephant, in so many particulars,\r\nthe form and structure of the grinders are sufficiently different from\r\nthose of the elephant, to demand its being placed in a distinct genus.\r\nFrom the later discoveries respecting this animal, M. Cuvier is also\r\ninclined to suppose that its food must have been similar to that of the\r\nhippopotamus and the boar, but preferring the roots and fleshy parts of\r\nvegetables; in the search of which species of food it would, of course,\r\nbe led to such soft and marshy spots as it appears to have inhabited. It\r\ndoes not, however, appear to have been at all formed for swimming, or\r\nfor living much in the waters, like the hippopotamus, but rather seems\r\nto have been entirely a terrestrial animal.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   FOSSIL REMAINS OF THE RHINOCEROS.\r\n\r\nThere appear to be three living species of rhinoceros: 1. That of India,\r\na unicorn, with a rugose coat, and with incisors, separated, by a space,\r\nfrom the grinders. 2. That of the Cape, a bicorn, the skin without rugæ,\r\nand having twenty eight grinders, and no incisors. 3. That of Sumatra, a\r\nbicorn, the skin but slightly rugose, thus far resembling that of the\r\nCape, but having incisive teeth, like that of India. The fossil remains\r\nof the rhinoceros have been generally found in the same countries where\r\nthe remains of elephants have been found; but they do not appear to have\r\nso generally excited attention; and, perhaps, but few of those who\r\ndiscovered them were able to determine to what animal they belonged.\r\nThus a tooth of this animal is described by Grew merely as the tooth of\r\na terrestrial animal; and the remains of this animal, found in the\r\nneighborhood of Canterbury, were supposed to have belonged to the\r\nhippopotamus. The first remains of this species, of which positive\r\nmention is made, were collected in England, in 1668, near Canterbury, in\r\nthe course of digging a well. In 1751, a large number of bones of this\r\nkind were disinterred in the chain of the Hartz, and their form caused\r\nthem at first to be taken for those of elephants; but the celebrated\r\nanatomist, Meckel, having compared one of the teeth found in this heap\r\nwith the teeth of the living rhinoceros he had observed at Paris,\r\nproved, in an explicit manner, and by the same method which has yielded\r\nus such knowledge of lost species, that the bones found in the Hartz\r\nwere the bones of the rhinoceros. Thence the path was clearly opened for\r\nall the paleontological researches on this kind of fossil. Twenty years\r\nafter the discovery made on the slopes of the Hartz, a much more\r\nextraordinary discovery, of which Siberia was the scene, threw a truly\r\nstriking light upon the question. A fossil rhinoceros, not reduced to\r\nbones alone, but entire, with its skin, was found in the month of\r\nDecember, 1771, on the borders of the Wiluji, a river which flows into\r\nthe Lena, below Yakoutsk, in Siberia, in the forty-fourth degree of\r\nlatitude. What characterized this individual, which was covered with\r\nhair, proves that the species to which it belonged, differing from that\r\nof warm countries, the only one we now know, was created to inhabit cold\r\nand temperate regions. Unfortunately, the skin of this precious animal\r\nhas not been preserved. Since that time, constant attempts have been\r\nmade to discover the bones of the rhinoceros, in a multitude of\r\ncountries of northern Europe and Asia; and M. Cuvier, in his “Researches\r\non Fossil Bones,” has given minute descriptions of them; but\r\nunfortunately, no individual as complete as that of Wiluji has since\r\nbeen discovered.\r\n\r\n\r\n                FOSSIL REMAINS OF THE SIBERIAN MAMMOTH.\r\n\r\nIt has been demonstrated by Cuvier, that this animal was of a different\r\nspecies from the mastodon, or American mammoth. Its bones have been\r\nfound in the alluvial soil near London, Northampton, Gloucester,\r\nHarwich, Norwich, in Salisbury plain, and in other places in England;\r\nthey also occur in the north of Ireland; and in Sweden, Iceland, Russia,\r\nPoland, Germany, France, Holland, and Hungary, the bones and teeth have\r\nbeen met with in abundance. Its teeth have also been found in North and\r\nSouth America, and abundantly in Asiatic Russia. Pallas says, that from\r\nthe Don to the Tchutskoiness, there is scarcely a river that does not\r\nafford the remains of the mammoth, and that they are frequently imbedded\r\nin _alluvial soil, containing marine productions_. The skeletons, a view\r\nof one of which is given in the cut below, are seldom complete; but the\r\nfollowing interesting narrative will show that, in one instance, the\r\nanimal has been found in an entire state.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SKELETON OF THE SIBERIAN MAMMOTH.]\r\n\r\nIn the year 1799, a Tungusian fisherman observed a strange shapeless\r\nmass projecting from an ice-bank, near the mouth of a river in the north\r\nof Siberia, the nature of which he did not understand, and which was so\r\nhigh in the bank as to be beyond his reach. The next year he observed\r\nthe same object, which was then rather more disengaged from among the\r\nice, but was still unable to conceive what it was. Toward the end of the\r\nfollowing summer, 1801, he could distinctly see that it was the frozen\r\ncarcass of a huge animal, the entire flank of which, and one of its\r\ntusks, had become disengaged from the ice. In consequence of the ice\r\nbeginning to melt earlier, and to a greater degree than usual, in 1803,\r\nthe fifth year of this discovery, the enormous carcass became entirely\r\ndisengaged, and fell down from the ice-crag on a sand-bank forming part\r\nof the coast of the Arctic ocean. In the month of March of that year,\r\nthe Tungusian carried away the two tusks, which he sold for fifty\r\nrubles, about thirty-eight dollars.\r\n\r\nTwo years afterward this animal still remained on the sand-bank, where\r\nit had fallen from the ice; but its body was then greatly mutilated. The\r\npeasants had taken away considerable quantities of its flesh to feed\r\ntheir dogs; and the wild animals, particularly the white bears, had also\r\nfeasted on the carcass; yet the skeleton remained quite entire, except\r\nthat one of the fore legs was gone. The entire spine, the pelvis, one\r\nshoulder-blade, and three legs, were still held together by their\r\nligaments, and by some remains of the skin; and the other shoulder-blade\r\nwas found at a short distance. The head remained, covered by the dried\r\nskin, and the pupil of the eyes was still distinguishable. The brain\r\nalso remained within the skull, but a good deal shrunk and dried up; and\r\none of the ears was in excellent preservation, still retaining a tuft of\r\nstrong bristly hair. The upper lip was a good deal eaten away, and the\r\nunder lip was entirely gone, so that the teeth were distinctly seen. The\r\nanimal was a male, and had a long mane on its neck.\r\n\r\nThe skin was extremely thick and heavy, and as much of it remained as\r\nrequired the exertions of ten men to carry away, which they did with\r\nconsiderable difficulty. More than thirty pounds of the hair and\r\nbristles of this animal were gathered from the wet sand-bank, having\r\nbeen trampled into the sand by the white bears, while devouring the\r\ncarcass. The hair was of three distinct kinds: one consisting of stiff\r\nblack bristles, a foot or more in length; another of thinner bristles,\r\nor coarse flexible hair, of a reddish-brown color; and the third of\r\ncoarse reddish-brown wool, which grew among the roots of the hair. These\r\nafford an undeniable proof that this animal had belonged to a race of\r\nelephants inhabiting a cold region, with which we are unacquainted, and\r\nby no means fitted to dwell in the torrid zone. It is also evident that\r\nthis enormous animal must have been frozen up by the ice at the moment\r\nof its death.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             FOSSIL SHELLS.\r\n\r\nAt whatever elevations these shells may have been found, and however\r\nremote from the parts of the globe now occupied by water, it is certain\r\nthat they were once generated in the sea, by which they were deposited.\r\nThe Altain chain of primitive mountains in Siberia is flanked on each\r\nside by a chain of hills inclosing marine shells. On a comparison of the\r\nforms, contexture and composition of these shells, as they have been\r\nfound imbedded in rocks, not the slightest difference can be detected\r\nbetween several varieties of them and those which still inhabit the sea.\r\nAt Touraine, in France, a hundred miles from the ocean, and about nine\r\nfeet beneath the surface, a bed of fossil shells has been found nine\r\nleagues in length, and about twenty feet in thickness. Such beds are\r\nknown to exist in every part of Europe; and in South America, according\r\nto Ulloa, they are very frequent.\r\n\r\nGreat Britain abounds in these fossil productions. In the cliffs of the\r\nisle of Sheppey, bordering on the Thames, several varieties of the crab,\r\nand lobsters nearly whole, have been found in a petrified state. Within\r\nthe elevated lands in the vicinity of Reading, in Berkshire, an\r\nabundance of oyster-shells has been found, many of them entire, and\r\nhaving both their valves united. At Broughton, in Lincolnshire, there\r\nare two quarries abounding in fresh-water shells, which are found in a\r\nblue stone, supposed to have been formerly clay, and to have been\r\ngradually indurated. A bed of shells, twelve feet thick, and lying in a\r\ngreenish sand, has been found about a mile from Reculver, in Kent. At\r\nHarwich, at the entrance of the river, a sandy cliff, fifty feet in\r\nhight, contains shells, of which there are no less than twenty-eight\r\nvarieties. On digging a moorish pasture, in Northamptonshire, many\r\nsnails and river shells were found; and these were the more abundant in\r\nproportion as the workmen proceeded to a greater depth. And, lastly, the\r\npetrifactions known by the name of _belemnites_, have been found in\r\nchalk pits, in different parts of the kingdom: they are usually\r\ncylindrical, or conical, and sometimes contain a hollow nucleus. They\r\nare supposed to constitute a species of nautilus, and very frequently\r\noccur in the coarser kinds of marble.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         SUBTERRANEAN FORESTS.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1708, a breach made by the Thames, at an extraordinary high\r\ntide, inundated the marshes of Dagenham and Havering, in Essex. Such was\r\nthe impetuous rush of the water, that a large passage or channel was\r\ntorn up, three hundred feet in width, and in some parts twenty feet in\r\ndepth. In this way, a great number of trees, that had been buried there\r\nmany ages before, were exposed to view. With one exception, that of a\r\nlarge oak, having the greatest part of its bark, and some of its heads\r\nand roots in a perfect state, these trees bore a greater resemblance to\r\nalder than to any other description of wood. They were black and hard,\r\nand their fibers were extremely tough. No doubt was entertained of their\r\nhaving grown on the spot where they lay; and they were so numerous, that\r\nin many places they afforded steps to the passengers. They were imbedded\r\nin a black oozy soil, on the surface of which they lay prostrate, with a\r\ncovering of grey mold.\r\n\r\nIn passing along the channel torn up by the water, vast numbers of the\r\nstumps of these subterraneous trees, remaining in the posture in which\r\nthey grew, were to be seen, some with their roots running down, and\r\nothers branching and spreading about in the earth, as is observed in\r\ngrowing trees. That they were the ruins, not of the deluge, but of a\r\nlater age, has been inferred from the existence of a bed of shells,\r\nwhich lies across the highway, on the descent near Stifford bridge,\r\nleading to South Okendon. At a perpendicular depth of twenty feet\r\nbeneath this bed of shells, and at the distance of nearly two hundred\r\nfeet, in the bottom of the valley, runs a brook which empties itself\r\ninto the Thames at Purfleet. This brook is known to ebb and flow with\r\nthe Thames; and, consequently, if the bed of shells, as has been\r\nconjectured, was deposited in that place by an inundation of the Thames,\r\nit must have been such as to have drowned a vast proportion of the\r\nsurrounding country, and have overtopped the trees near the river, in\r\nWest Horrock, Dagenham, and the other marshes, overturning them in its\r\nprogress. In support of this hypothesis, it should be remarked, that the\r\nbed of earth in which the trees grew, was entire and undisturbed, and\r\nconsisted of a spongy, light, oozy soil, filled with the roots of reeds,\r\nof a specific gravity much less than that of the stratum above it.\r\n\r\nThe levels of Hatfield chase were, in the reign of Charles I., the\r\nlargest chase of red deer in England. They contained about one hundred\r\nand eighty thousand acres of land, about one-half of which was yearly\r\ninundated; but being sold to one Vermuiden, a Dutchman, he contrived, at\r\na great labor and expense, to dischase, drain, and reduce these lands to\r\narable and pasture grounds not subject to be overflowed. In every part\r\nof the soil, in the bottom of the river Ouse even, and in that of the\r\nadventitious soil of all marsh land, together with the skirts of the\r\nLincolnshire wold, vast multitudes of the roots and trunks of trees of\r\ndifferent sizes are found. The roots are fixed in the soil, in their\r\nnatural position, as thick as they could have grown; and near to them\r\nlie the trunks. Many of these trees appear to have been burned, and\r\nothers to have been chopped and squared; and this in such places, and at\r\nsuch depths, as could never have been opened, since the destruction of\r\nthe forest, until the time of the drainage. That this was the work of\r\nthe Romans, who were the destroyers of all the woods and forests which\r\nare now found underground in the bottoms of moors and bogs, is evidenced\r\nby the coins and utensils, belonging to that nation, which have been\r\ncollected, as well in these levels, as in other parts of Great Britain\r\nwhere these subterraneous forests have been discovered.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        MOORS, MOSSES AND BOGS.\r\n\r\nIt having been reported in Lincolnshire, that a large extent of islets\r\nof moor, situated along its coast, and visible only at the lowest ebbs\r\nof the tide, was chiefly composed of decayed trees, Dr. de Serra,\r\naccompanied by Sir Joseph Banks, proceeded, in the month of September,\r\n1796, to examine their nature and extent. They landed on one of the\r\nlargest of these islets, when the ebbs were at the lowest, and found its\r\nexposed surface to be about ninety feet in length, and seventy-five in\r\nwidth. They were enabled to ascertain, that these islets consist almost\r\nentirely of roots, trunks, branches, and leaves of trees and shrubs,\r\nintermixed with leaves of aquatic plants. The remains of many of the\r\ntrees were still standing on their roots; but the trunks of the greater\r\npart of them lay scattered on the ground, in every direction. The bark\r\nof the trees and roots appeared in general as fresh as when they were\r\ngrowing; in that of the birches particularly, many of which were found,\r\neven the thin silvery membranes of the outer skin were discernible. The\r\ntimber of all kinds, on the contrary, was decomposed and soft, in the\r\ngreater part of the trees; in some it was firm, especially about the\r\nknots. Sound pieces of timber had been often found by the country\r\npeople. In general, the trunks, branches and roots of the decayed trees\r\nwere considerably flattened; a phenomenon which has been observed in the\r\n_surtarbrand_, or fossil wood of Iceland, and also in that found near\r\nthe lake of Thun, in Switzerland. The soil was chiefly composed of\r\nrotten leaves; and, on being thrown into water, many of these were taken\r\nout in a perfect state.\r\n\r\nThese islets extended about twelve miles in length, and one in breadth,\r\nopposite the shore of Sutton, at which place, on digging a well, a moor\r\nof the same nature was found under ground, at the depth of sixteen feet,\r\nand, consequently, very nearly on the same level with that which\r\nconstitutes the islets. On boring in the fields belonging to the Royal\r\nSociety, in the parish of Mablethorpe, to ascertain the cause of the\r\nsubterraneous stratum of decayed vegetables, a similar moor was found.\r\nThe appearance of these decayed vegetables was found exactly to agree\r\nwith that of the moor which was thrown up in Blankney fen, and in other\r\nparts of the east fen of Lincolnshire, in making their embankments;\r\nbarks, like those of the birch-tree, being there also abundantly found.\r\nThis moor has been traced as far as Peterborough, sixty miles south of\r\nSutton. On the north side, the moory islets extend as far as Grimsby, on\r\nthe south of the mouth of the Humber: and it is a remarkable\r\ncircumstance, that in the large tracts of low land which lie on the\r\nsouth banks of that river, a little above its mouth, there is a\r\nsubterraneous stratum of decayed trees and shrubs, exactly resembling\r\nthose observed at Sutton. At Axholme isle, a similar stratum extends\r\nover a tract of ten miles in length, by five in breadth. The roots there\r\nalso stand in the places where they grew; while the trunks lie\r\nprostrate, amid the roots of aquatic plants and reeds. Little doubt can\r\nbe entertained of the moory islets of Sutton being a part of this\r\nextensive subterraneous stratum, which, by some inroad of the sea, has\r\nbeen there stripped of its covering of soil. The identity of the levels;\r\nthat of the species of trees; the roots of these affixed, in both, to\r\nthe soil where they grew; and, above all, the flattened shape of the\r\ntrunks, branches, and roots, found in the islets, which can only be\r\naccounted for by the heavy pressure of a superinduced stratum, are\r\nsufficient reasons for this opinion. Such a wide-spread assemblage of\r\nvegetable ruins, lying almost in the same level, and that level\r\ngenerally under the common mark of low water, naturally gives rise to\r\nreflections on the epoch of this destruction, and the agency by which it\r\nwas effected.\r\n\r\nThe original catastrophe which buried this immense forest must have been\r\nof very ancient date; but it is to be suspected, that the inroad of the\r\nsea which uncovered the decayed trees of the islets of Sutton, is\r\ncomparatively recent. The state of the leaves, and the timber, and also\r\nthe tradition of the country people, concur to strengthen this\r\nsuspicion. Leaves and other delicate parts of plants, though they may be\r\nlong preserved in a subterraneous situation, can not remain uninjured\r\nwhen exposed to the action of the waves, and of the air. The inhabitants\r\nof Sutton believe that their parish church once stood on the spot where\r\nthe islets now are, and was submerged by the inroads of the sea; that,\r\nat very low water, their ancestors could even discern its ruins; and\r\nthat their present church was built to supply the place of that which\r\nwas washed away. So many concomitant (though weak) testimonies, render\r\ntheir report to a certain degree deserving of credit, and lead to a\r\nsupposition, that some of the stormy inundations of the North sea, which\r\nin these last centuries have washed away such large tracts of land on\r\nits shores, may have carried away a soil resting on clay, and have\r\nfinally uncovered the trees of these moory islets.\r\n\r\nBogs and mosses are little more than lakes filled up with vegetable\r\nmatter, usually of aquatic origin. They are to be found not only in\r\nIreland and Scotland, but also in every northern country, more\r\nespecially when thinly peopled. It should be remarked, that Ireland\r\nabounds in springs, which are mostly dry in summer; and that grass and\r\nweeds grow abundantly about these spots. In the winter these springs\r\nswell and run, softening and loosening all the earth about them. Now,\r\nthat sward or surface of the earth which consists of the roots of grass,\r\nbeing lifted up, and made fuzzy or spongy by the water in the winter, is\r\ndried in the spring, and does not fall together, but withers in a tuft.\r\nThe new grass which springs through it is again lifted during the\r\nfollowing winter; and thus the spring is still more and more stopped,\r\nand the sward grows thicker and thicker, till at length it makes what is\r\ncalled a quaking bog. In proportion as it rises and becomes drier, and\r\nas the grass roots and other vegetables become more putrid, together\r\nwith the mud and slime of the water, it acquires a blackness, and\r\nbecomes what is called a turf bog. When the vegetables rot, it is\r\nconsidered that the saline particles are in general carried away by the\r\nwater, in which they are dissolved; but that the oily or sulphureous\r\nparticles remain and float on the water; and it is thus that the turf\r\nacquires its inflammability. The highest mountains of Ireland are, as\r\nwell as the plains, covered with bogs, because they abound in springs,\r\nwhich, on account of a defective population, are not cleared; and thus\r\nthey are overrun with bogs. In that country mosses also abound; and the\r\nparticular kind which grows in bogs, is remarkable on this account, that\r\na congeries of its threads, before it is decayed, constitutes the\r\nsubstance of the light spongy turf, which thus becomes so tough as not\r\nto yield to the spade. This curious substance, in the north of Ireland,\r\nis called _old wives’ tow_, and is not unlike flax. The turf hardens by\r\ndegrees, but is still stringy when broken, and at length becomes the red\r\nturf employed as fuel.\r\n\r\nThe production of the quaking bogs is as follows. When a stream or\r\nspring runs through a flat, it becomes filled with weeds in summer, and\r\ntrees fall across and dam it up. During the winter season the water\r\nstagnates more and more every year, until the whole flat is covered. A\r\ncoarse kind of grass, peculiar to these bogs, springs up in tufts, the\r\nroots of which are consolidated, and which, in a few years, grow to the\r\nhight of several feet. In the winter the grass rots, and falls with its\r\nseed on the tufts, thus adding to their growth the ensuing spring. The\r\ntops of flags and grass are sometimes interwoven on the surface of the\r\nwater, and gradually becoming thicker, cover its surface. On this\r\ncovering herbs grow; and by the interweaving of their roots, it is\r\nrendered so strong as to bear a man. Some of these bogs sink, where a\r\nman stands, to a considerable depth, and rise before and behind:\r\nunderneath, the water is clear. Even these in time become red bogs; but\r\nmay easily be converted into meadow land, by clearing a trench for the\r\npassage of the water.\r\n\r\nSir Hans Sloane, in his account of the bogs of Ireland, published in the\r\n“Philosophical Transactions,” notices a curious fact, namely, that when\r\nthe turf-diggers, after having dug out the earth proper to make turf or\r\npeat, reached the bottom, so as to come to the clayey or other soil, by\r\ndraining off the water, they met with the roots of fir-trees, with their\r\nstumps standing upright, and their branches spread out on every side\r\nhorizontally. This was evidently the place of the growth of these trees,\r\nthe branches of the roots of which are in some parts matted, as is seen\r\nin the roots of trees closely planted. Large pieces of wood have been\r\nfound, not only in clay-pits, but likewise in quarries or stone-pits, in\r\nthe blocks of stone raised out of their strata or layers. The black\r\nspongy mold employed for peat smells strongly of bitumen, or petroleum,\r\na great proportion of the oil of which is yielded by distillation; so\r\nthat, singular as it may appear, not only oil, but a material which may\r\nbe used for candles, may be extracted from these peat-bogs in large\r\nquantities; and it has even been proposed that this business should be\r\ncarried on on a large scale, with a view to giving prosperity to the\r\ncountry. In several parts of Ireland a singular phenomenon has been\r\nobserved: on horses trampling with their feet on a space of soft ground,\r\na sudden appearance of light ensued. On the mold, which agreed in color,\r\nlightness, &c., with peat earth, being examined with a microscope, the\r\nlight was found to proceed from an abundance of small, semi-transparent,\r\nwhitish, live worms which lay in it.\r\n\r\nThe commissioners appointed by parliament to inquire into the nature and\r\nextent of the bogs of Ireland, and the practicability of draining them,\r\nrepresent them as occupying thousands of acres, indeed, many square\r\nmiles. Their nature and constituent parts are described by them as\r\nconsisting of an accumulation of vegetable matter, settling in\r\nsuccessive generations on itself, and converted by the want of\r\nventilation and motion to a stagnant pool, which first furnished the\r\nelements of life and increase to the plants covering its surface. The\r\nprogress of the accumulation may be best conceived by imagining a basin,\r\nor concave reservoir, of a certain extent and depth, formed of clay,\r\nlimestone, gravel, &c., through which the water, scantily but constantly\r\nsupplied, can not obtain an issue. Undisturbed in this water, a surface\r\nof bog moss grows, decays and putrefies. To this a second generation\r\nsucceeds; and this is followed by others, until, at length, the bulk\r\nrises considerably above the level of its bed, forming hillocks of\r\nvarious hights, shapes and dimensions. The surface of a bog is not level\r\nlike a lake, but undulating; and it terminates somewhat abruptly, and\r\nalmost perpendicularly. The average hight of the great bogs, above the\r\nlevel of high-water mark in Dublin harbor, is about two hundred and\r\nfifty feet. Many acres of these bogs have been reclaimed; and the\r\npracticability of draining and cultivating the greater proportion of\r\nthem has been pointed out in the reports of the commissioners.\r\n\r\nPerthshire, in North Britain, abounds in mosses, the contents of which\r\nare computed to exceed nine thousand acres. The greatest hight of the\r\nmoss, above the clay on which it lies, is fourteen feet and a half. Its\r\nsurface, when viewed at a distance, seems wholly covered with heath: but\r\nwhen closely examined, is found to be composed of small tufts of heath,\r\nintermixed with a variety of moss-plants. Here also are found\r\ninnumerable trunks of trees, lying along close to their roots, the\r\nlatter being still fixed in the clay, as in the natural state.\r\n\r\nThe irruption of what is called Solway moss has greatly attracted the\r\npublic attention; for, although the cause of it is obvious, still the\r\nalteration it produced on the surface of the earth, was more\r\nconsiderable than any known in Great Britain, as resulting from a\r\nnatural cause, since the destruction of Earl Goodwin’s estate. It\r\nhappened in the year 1771, after severe rains which had in many places\r\nproduced great inundations of the rivers. The following is a concise\r\ndescription of the spot where this event happened. Along the side of the\r\nriver Esk, is a vale, about a mile in breadth, bounded on the south-east\r\nby the river, and on the north-west by a steep bank, about thirty feet\r\nin hight above the level of the vale. From the top of the bank the\r\nground rises on an easy ascent for about a quarter of a mile, where it\r\nis terminated by the moss, which extends about two miles north and\r\nsouth, and about a mile and a half east and west, being bounded on the\r\nnorth-west by the river Sark. It is probable that the solid ground, from\r\nthe top of the bank above the vale, was continued in the same direction\r\nunder the moss, before its irruption, for a considerable space; for the\r\nmoss, at the place where the irruption happened, was inclined toward the\r\nsloping ground. From the edge of the moss there was a gully or hollow,\r\ncalled by the country people _the gap_, and said to be thirty yards deep\r\nwhere it entered the vale: down this hollow ran a small rill of water,\r\nwhich was often dry in summer, not having any other supply but what\r\nfiltered from the moss.\r\n\r\nThe irruption happened, at the head of this gap, on the night of the\r\nsixteenth of November, between the hours of ten and eleven, when all the\r\nneighboring rivers and brooks were prodigiously swollen by the rains. A\r\nlarge body of the moss was forced, partly by the great fall of rain, and\r\npartly by the springs beneath, into a small beck or burn, which runs\r\nwithin a few yards of its border to the south-east. By the united\r\npressure of the water behind it, and of this beck, which was then very\r\nhigh, it was carried down a narrow glen between two banks about three\r\nhundred feet high, into a wide and spacious plain, over a part of which\r\nit spread with great rapidity. The moss continued for some time to send\r\noff considerable quantities of its substance, which, being borne along\r\nby the torrent, on the back of the first great body, kept it for many\r\nhours in perpetual motion, and drove it still further on. During the\r\nfirst night, at least four hundred acres of fine arable land were\r\ncovered with moss from three to twelve or fifteen feet in depth. Several\r\nhouses were destroyed, much corn lost, &c.; but all the inhabitants\r\nescaped. When the waters subsided, the moss also ceased to flow; but two\r\npretty considerable streams continued to run from the heart of it, and\r\ncarried away some pieces of mossy matter to the place where it burst.\r\nThey then joined the beck, already mentioned, which with this addition,\r\nresumed its former channel, and with a little assistance from the people\r\nof the neighborhood, made its way to the Esk, through the midst of that\r\nbody of moss which obstructed its course. Thus, in a great measure\r\ndrained, the new moss fell several feet, and when the fair weather came\r\non at the end of November, it settled in a firmer and more solid body on\r\nthe lands it had overrun. By this inundation about eight hundred acres\r\nof arable ground were overflowed before the moss stopped, and the\r\nhabitations of twenty-seven families destroyed.\r\n\r\nTradition has preserved the memory of a similar inundation in another\r\npart of North Britain. At Monteith a moss changed its course in one\r\nnight, and covered a great extent of ground. There is also an account in\r\nthe “Philosophical Transactions” of a moving moss near Churchtown, in\r\nLancashire, which greatly alarmed the neighborhood, and was regarded as\r\na miracle. The moss was observed to rise to a surprising hight, and soon\r\nafter to sink as much beneath the level, moving slowly toward the south.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        CORAL REEFS AND ISLANDS.\r\n\r\nCoral belongs to the class of those surprising productions of nature,\r\nwhich are named _zoöphytes_, or plant-animals, on account of their\r\nfilling up the intermediate space between the animal and vegetable\r\nkingdoms; and in treating of them this curious substance will be\r\ndistinctly considered. In the mean time, the production of coral reefs\r\nand islands presents one of those geological changes, by which the\r\nearth’s surface has been modified, and has received a new accession from\r\nthe sea.\r\n\r\nThe common foundation of the clusters of islands discovered by modern\r\nnavigators in the Pacific ocean, as well as of those belonging to New\r\nSouth Wales, is evidently of coral structure, immense reefs of which\r\nshoot out in all directions. There is every reason to believe that the\r\nislands which are occasionally raised by the tremendous agency of\r\nsubterraneous volcanoes, do not bear any proportion to those which are\r\nperpetually forming, by the silent but persevering efforts of the sea\r\nworms by which coral is produced. Banks of coral are found at all\r\ndepths, and at all distances from the shore, entirely unconnected with\r\nthe land, and detached from each other. By a quick progression, they\r\ngrow up toward the surface; while the winds, heaping up the coral from\r\ndeeper water, rapidly accelerate the formation of these banks into\r\nshoals and islands. They become gradually shallower; and when once the\r\nsea meets with resistance, the coral is quickly thrown up by the force\r\nof the waves breaking against the bank. These coral banks have been seen\r\nin all their stages: some in deep water; others with a few rocks\r\nappearing above the surface, just formed into islands without the least\r\nappearance of vegetation; and, lastly, others covered with soil and\r\nweeds.\r\n\r\nThe loose corals, rolled inward by the billows in large pieces, strike\r\nupon the grounds, and, the reflux being unable to carry them away,\r\nbecome a bar to the coagulated sand with which they are always\r\nintermixed. This sand, being easiest raised, is lodged at top; and when\r\nits accumulated mass is elevated by violent storms, and no longer within\r\nthe reach of common waves, it becomes a resting-place to birds whom the\r\nsearch of prey draws thither. Their excrement, feathers, &c., augment\r\nthe soil, and prepare it for the reception of accidental roots, branches\r\nand seeds cast up by the waves, or brought thither by birds. Thus\r\nislands are formed: the leaves and rotten branches, intermixing with the\r\nsand, produce in time a light black mold, in which trees and shrubs\r\nvegetate and thrive. Cocoa-nuts, which continue long in the sea without\r\nlosing their vegetative powers, having been thrown on such islands,\r\nproduce trees which are particularly adapted to all soils, whether\r\nsandy, rich or rocky. The violence of the waves, within the tropics,\r\nmust generally be directed to two points, according to the monsoons.\r\nHence the islands formed from coral banks must be long and narrow, and\r\nlie nearly in a meridional direction. Even supposing the banks to be\r\nround, as they seldom are when large, the sea meeting most resistance in\r\nthe middle, must heave up the matter in greater quantities there, than\r\ntoward the extremities; and, by the same rule, the ends will generally\r\nbe open, or at least lowest. They will also commonly have soundings\r\nthere, as the remains of the banks, not accumulated, will be under\r\nwater. Where the coral banks are not exposed to the common monsoon, they\r\nwill alter their direction, and become either round, or extended in the\r\nparallel, or of irregular forms, according to accidental circumstances.\r\n\r\nCaptain Flinders, in his voyage to the South Pacific, gives an account\r\nof an unbroken reef of coral, three hundred and fifty miles long, on the\r\ncoast of New Holland; and he states, that between that country and New\r\nGuinea, the coral formations extend through a distance of seven hundred\r\nmiles, interrupted by no intervals of more than thirty miles in length.\r\nHe also gives us a lively and interesting description of a coral reef on\r\nthe southern coast of New South Wales. On this reef he landed, and the\r\nwater being very clear round the edges, a new creation, as it were, but\r\nimitative of the old, was presented to the view. Wheat sheaves,\r\nmushrooms, stags’ horns, cabbage leaves, and a variety of other forms,\r\nwere glowing under water with vivid tints of every shade betwixt green,\r\npurple, brown and white; equaling in beauty, and excelling in grandeur,\r\nthe most favorite _parterre_ of the curious florist. These were\r\ndifferent species of coral and fungus, growing, as it were, out of the\r\nsolid rock, and each had its peculiar form and shade of coloring; but,\r\nwhilst contemplating the richness of the scene, the destruction with\r\nwhich it was pregnant could not be forgotten. Different corals in a dead\r\nstate, concreted into a solid mass of a dull white color, composed the\r\nstone of the reef. The negro heads were lumps which stood higher than\r\nthe rest; and being generally dry, were blackened by the weather; but\r\neven in these the forms of the different corals and some shells were\r\ndistinguishable. The edges of the reef, but particularly on the outside\r\nwhere the sea broke, were the lightest parts; within these were pools\r\nand holes containing live corals, sponges, sea-eggs and cucumbers; and\r\nmany enormous cockles were scattered upon different parts of the reef.\r\nAt low water, these cockles seem most commonly to lie half open, but\r\nfrequently close with much noise, and the water within the shells then\r\nspouts up in a stream, three or four feet high: it is from this noise\r\nand the spouting of the water that they are discovered, for, in other\r\nrespects, they are scarcely to be distinguished from the coral rock.\r\n\r\nHis description of a coral island which he afterward visited on the same\r\ncoast, is truly philosophical and throws great light on these surprising\r\nproductions of nature.\r\n\r\n“This little island, or rather the surrounding reef, which is three or\r\nfour miles long, affords shelter from the south-east winds. It is\r\nscarcely more than a mile in circumference, but appears to be increasing\r\nboth in elevation and extent. At no very distant period of time, it was\r\none of those banks produced by the washing up of sand and broken coral,\r\nof which most reefs afford instances, and those of Torres’ strait a\r\ngreat many. These banks are in different stages of progress: some, like\r\nthis, are become islands, but not yet habitable; some are above\r\nhigh-water mark, but destitute of vegetation; whilst others are\r\noverflowed with every returning tide. It seems to me, that, when the\r\nanimalcules which form the corals at the bottom of the ocean, cease to\r\nlive, their structures adhere to each other, by virtue either of the\r\nglutinous remains within, or of some property in salt water; and the\r\ninterstices being gradually filled up with sand and broken pieces of\r\ncoral washed by the sea, which also adhere, a mass of rock is at length\r\nformed. Future races of these animalcules erect their habitations upon\r\nthe rising bank, and die in their turn, to increase, but principally to\r\nelevate, this monument of their wonderful labors. The care taken to work\r\nperpendicularly in the early stages, marks a surprising instinct in\r\nthese diminutive creatures. Their wall of coral is for the most part in\r\nsituations where the winds are constant, and when it reaches the\r\nsurface, it affords a shelter, to the leeward of which their infant\r\ncolonies may be safely sent forth; and to this their instinctive\r\nforesight it seems to be owing, that the windward side of a reef exposed\r\nto the open sea, is generally, if not always, the highest part, and\r\nrises almost perpendicular, sometimes from the depth of two hundred, and\r\nperhaps many more fathoms. To be constantly covered with water, seems\r\nnecessary to the existence of the animalcules, for they do not work,\r\nexcept in holes upon the reef, beyond low-water mark; but the coral sand\r\nand other broken remnants thrown up by the sea adhere to the rock, and\r\nform a solid mass with it, as high as the common tides reach. That\r\nelevation surpassed, the future remnants, being rarely covered, lose\r\ntheir adhesive property; and remaining in a loose state, form what is\r\nusually called a _key_ upon the tops of the reef. The new bank is not\r\nlong in being visited by sea-birds; salt plants take root upon it, and a\r\nsoil begins to be formed; a cocoa-nut is thrown on shore; land birds\r\nvisit it and deposit the seeds of shrubs and trees; every high tide, and\r\nstill more every gale, adds something to the bank; the form of an island\r\nis gradually assumed, and last of all comes man to take possession. This\r\nisland is well advanced in the above progressive state; having been many\r\nyears, probably some ages, above the reach of the highest spring-tides,\r\nor the wash of the surf in the heaviest gales. I distinguished, however,\r\nin the rock which forms its basis, the sand, coral and shells formerly\r\nthrown up, in a more or less perfect state of cohesion; small pieces of\r\nwood, pumice-stone, and other extraneous bodies, which chance had mixed\r\nwith the calcareous substances when the cohesion began, were inclosed in\r\nthe rock, and, in some cases, were still separable from it without much\r\nforce. The upper part of the island is a mixture of the same substances\r\nin a loose state, with a little vegetable soil, and is covered with the\r\n_casuarina_ and a variety of other trees and shrubs, which give food to\r\nparoquets, pigeons, and some other birds; to whose ancestors it is\r\nprobable the island was originally indebted for this vegetation.”\r\n\r\n\r\n              -------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n                     WIDE AND INHOSPITABLE DESERTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  ------------------------------------\r\n\r\n                            ASIATIC DESERTS.\r\n\r\nIn Africa, as well as Asia, there are immense tracts of land called\r\ndeserts, which consist of vast plains composed of loose sand. Large\r\nportions of these are utterly destitute of vegetation, and sometimes, in\r\ncrossing them, the traveler sees not a hill or mountain, or human\r\ndwelling, or even a tree or shrub, or blade of grass. All around is a\r\nsea of sand; and far as the eye can reach, it is one scene of lifeless\r\nsolitude and desolation. These trackless wastes are traversed by\r\ncaravans, which are companies of travelers usually mounted upon camels.\r\nHorses travel in these sands with difficulty. Their feet sink in the\r\nsoil; they are overcome with heat, and parched with drought. The camel,\r\non the contrary, has a large, spongy foot, which does not sink in the\r\nsand; he can bear excessive heat, and by a curious contrivance of\r\nnature, is enabled to go without water for five or six days. This\r\nvaluable creature is called the ship of the desert, because it enables\r\nthe merchants of Asia and Africa to transport their merchandise over the\r\nsea of sand, just as a ship carries goods from one part of the world to\r\nanother, across the briny ocean. It seems really as if Providence had\r\nprovided this singular animal on purpose to enable mankind to traverse\r\nthe great deserts which are spread out upon the eastern continent.\r\n\r\nThe chief Asiatic deserts are in Persia and Arabia, the former of which\r\ncountries contains three of considerable extent and celebrity. The first\r\nof these commences on the east of the Tigris, in latitude thirty-three,\r\nand extends to the north of Shuster. The second reaches from the\r\nvicinity of Korn very nearly to the Zurra, in a line, from east to west,\r\nof about four hundred English miles, and from north to south, of about\r\ntwo hundred and fifty. In the latter direction it joins the great desert\r\nof Kerman, which, alone, extends over a tract of three hundred and fifty\r\nmiles. The two may, therefore, be considered as forming one common\r\ndesert, stretching north-west and south-east, over a space of about\r\nseven hundred miles; thus intersecting this wide empire into two nearly\r\nequal portions. This vast region is impregnated with niter and other\r\nsalts, which taint the neighboring lakes and rivers, and has, on that\r\naccount, been denominated the Great Saline Desert.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            ARABIAN DESERTS.\r\n\r\nThe sandy deserts of Arabia form one of the most striking objects of\r\nthat country. From the hills of Omon, which appear to be a continuation\r\nof those on the other side of the Persian gulf, as far as Mecca, the\r\ngreater part of Negad is one prodigious desert, interrupted, toward the\r\nfrontiers of Hejaz and Yemen, or Arabia Felix, by Kirge, containing the\r\ndistrict of Sursa, and several _oases_, or fertile spots. The north-west\r\npart of Negad presents almost a continued desert, and is considered as a\r\nprolongation of the one above mentioned.\r\n\r\nThe Beled el Haram, or Holy Land of Islam, of which Mecca is the\r\ncapital, is comprehended between the Red sea, and an irregular line\r\nwhich, commencing at Arabog, about sixty miles to the north of Djedda,\r\nforms a bend from the north-east to the south-east, in passing by\r\nYelemlem, two days’ journey to the north-east of Mecca. It thence\r\ncontinues to Karna, nearly seventy miles to the east of the same place,\r\nand twenty-four miles to the west of Taif, which is without the limit of\r\nthe Holy Land; after which, turning to the south-west, it passes by\r\nDrataerk, and terminates at Mehherma upon the coast, at the port named\r\nAlmarsa Ibrahim, about ninety miles to the south-east of Djedda.\r\n\r\nIt therefore appears that the holy land is about one hundred and seventy\r\nmiles in length, from the north-west to the south-east, and eighty-four\r\nmiles in breadth, from the north-east to the south-west; which space is\r\ncomprehended in that part of Arabia known by the name of El Hedjeaz, or\r\nthe Land of Pilgrimage, and includes the cities of Medina and Taif. It\r\nhas not any river; and the only water to be found, is that of some\r\ninconsiderable springs, which are not numerous, and the brackish water\r\nobtained from the deep wells. Thus it is a real desert. It is at Mecca\r\nand Medina alone, that cisterns have been wrought to preserve the\r\nrain-water; on which account, a garden is very rarely to be seen\r\nthroughout this vast territory. The plains are composed either of sand,\r\nor barren earth, entirely abandoned; and, as the inhabitants do not, in\r\nany part of the country, sow any description of grain, they are supplied\r\nwith flour, &c., from upper Egypt, Yemen and India.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            AFRICAN DESERTS.\r\n\r\nThe most striking feature of Africa consists of the immense deserts\r\nwhich pervade its surface, and which are supposed to comprise the\r\none-half of its whole extent. The chief of these is, by way of eminence,\r\ncalled Sahara, or the Desert. It stretches from the shores of the\r\nAtlantic, with few interruptions, to the confines of Egypt, a space of\r\nmore than forty-five degrees, or about three thousand miles, by a\r\nbreadth of twelve degrees, or about nine hundred miles; its whole extent\r\nbeing two-thirds as large as that of the United States. It is one\r\nprodigious expanse of red sand, and sandstone rock, of the granulations\r\nof which the red sand consists. It is, in truth, an empire of sand which\r\nseems to defy every exertion of human power or industry, although it is\r\ninterspersed with various islands, and fertile and cultivated spots of\r\ndifferent sizes, where water collects in springs or pools, around which\r\nvegetation springs up. These places, which present a delightful contrast\r\nto the surrounding sterility, and cheer the eye of the weary traveler,\r\nare called _oases_. Fezzan, or Fessan, is the chief of those which have\r\nbeen hitherto explored.\r\n\r\nNearly in the center of the southern line of this sandy ocean, and about\r\nmidway between the Mediterranean sea and the coast of Guinea, rise the\r\nwalls of Timbuctoo, a city which constitutes the great mart for the\r\ncommerce of all the interior of Africa. To maintain this commerce is the\r\nlaborious work of the _akkabaars_, or caravans, which cross this\r\nenormous desert from almost every part of the African coast. The mode in\r\nwhich it is traversed is highly curious. The caravans consist of several\r\nhundred loaded camels, accompanied by the Arabs who let them out to the\r\nmerchants for the transportation of their goods. During their route,\r\nthey are often exposed to the attacks of the roving Arabs of Sahara, who\r\ngenerally commit their depredations on the approach to the confines of\r\nthe desert. In this tiresome journey, the caravans do not proceed to the\r\nplace of their destination, in a direct line across the trackless\r\ndesert, but turn occasionally eastward or westward, according to the\r\nsituation of the oases of which we have spoken, which are interspersed\r\nin various parts of the Sahara, like islands in the ocean. These serve\r\nas watering-places to the men, as well as to feed, refresh and replenish\r\nthe hardy and patient camel. At each of these cultivated spots, the\r\ncaravan sojourns several days, and then proceeds on its journey, until\r\nit reaches another spot of the same description. In the intermediate\r\njourneys, the hot winds, denominated shume, or simoom, are often so\r\nviolent and penetrating, as considerably, if not entirely, to exhale the\r\nwater carried in skins by the camels for the use of the passengers and\r\ndrivers. On these occasions, it is affirmed by the Arabs, five hundred\r\ndollars have been frequently given for a draught of water, and that ten\r\nor twenty dollars are often paid, when a partial exhalation has\r\noccurred. These scorching winds are sometimes called the _samiel_, and\r\nare supposed by some, to be pestilential in their nature.\r\n\r\nIn 1805, a caravan proceeding from Timbuctoo to Tafilet, was\r\ndisappointed in not finding water at one of the usual watering-places,\r\nwhen, horrible to relate, the whole of the persons belonging to it, two\r\nthousand in number, besides one thousand eight hundred camels, perished\r\nof thirst! Accidents of this nature, account for the vast quantities of\r\nhuman and other bones which are found heaped together in various parts\r\nof the desert.\r\n\r\nThe following is the general route of the caravans, in crossing the\r\ngreat desert. Having left the city of Fez, they proceed at the rate of\r\nthree miles and a half an hour, and travel seven hours each day. In the\r\nspace of eighteen days they reach Akka, where they remain a month, as\r\nthis is the place of rendezvous at which they are formed into one grand\r\naccumulated caravan. In proceeding from Akka to Tagassa, sixteen days\r\nare employed; and here again, the caravan sojourns fifteen days to\r\nrefresh the camels. It then directs its course to the oasis and well of\r\nTaudeny, which is reached in seven days; and, after another stay of\r\nfifteen days, it proceeds to Arawan, a watering-place, situated at a\r\nlike distance. After having sojourned there fifteen days, it sets out,\r\nand reaches Timbuctoo on the sixth day, after having performed a journey\r\nof fifty-four days of actual traveling, and seventy-five of repose;\r\nmaking, altogether, from Fez to Timbuctoo, one hundred and twenty-nine\r\ndays, or four lunar months and nine days. Another caravan sets out from\r\nWedinoon and Sok Assa, traversing the desert between the Black mountains\r\nof Cape Bojador and Gualata: it touches at Tagassa and El Garbie, or\r\nWest Tagassa, where having staid to collect salt, it proceeds to\r\nTimbuctoo. The time occupied by this caravan is five or six months, as\r\nit proceeds as far as Gibbelel-bied, or the White mountains, near Cape\r\nBlanco, through the deserts of Mograffa and Woled Abusebah, to a place\r\nnamed Agadeen, where it sojourns twenty days.\r\n\r\nThe caravans which cross the desert, may be compared to fleets of\r\nmerchant vessels under convoy; the _stata_, or convoy of the desert,\r\nconsisting of a certain number of Arabs, belonging to the tribe through\r\nwhose territory the caravan passes. Thus, in crossing the territory of\r\nWoled Abusebah, it is accompanied by Sebayhees, or people of that\r\ncountry, who, on reaching the confines of the territory of Woled Deleim,\r\ndeliver their charge to the protection of the chiefs of that country.\r\nThese, again, conduct it to the confines of the territory of the\r\nMograffa Arabs, under whose care it at length reaches Timbuctoo. Any\r\nassault on the caravan during this journey, is considered as an insult\r\nto the whole tribe to which the convoy belongs; and for such an outrage\r\nthey never fail to take ample revenge. Besides these grand caravans,\r\nothers cross the desert, on an emergency, without a convoy or guard.\r\nThis is, however, a perilous expedition, as they are too often plundered\r\nnear the northern confines of the desert, by two notorious tribes, named\r\nDikna and Emjot. In the year 1798, a caravan consisting of two thousand\r\ncamels, laden with the produce of the Soudan territory, together with\r\nseven hundred slaves, was plundered and dispersed, with great slaughter.\r\nThese desperate attacks are conducted in the following manner. The tribe\r\nbeing assembled, the horses are picketed at the entrance of the tents,\r\nand scouts sent out, to give notice when a caravan is likely to pass.\r\nThese scouts being mounted on the fleet horses of the desert, quickly\r\ncommunicate the intelligence, and the whole tribe mount their horses,\r\ntaking with them a sufficient number of female camels, on whose milk\r\nthey entirely subsist. Having placed themselves in ambush near an oasis,\r\nor watering-place, they issue thence on the arrival of the caravan,\r\nwhich they plunder without mercy, leaving the unfortunate merchants\r\nentirely destitute.\r\n\r\nThe food, dress and accommodations of the people who compose the\r\ncaravans, are simple and natural. Being prohibited by their religion the\r\nuse of wine and intoxicating liquors, and exhorted by its principles to\r\ntemperance in all things, they are commonly satisfied with a few\r\nnourishing dates, and a draught of water, traveling for weeks\r\nsuccessively without any other food. At other times, when they undertake\r\na journey of a few weeks across the desert, a little barley meal, mixed\r\nwith water, constitutes their only nourishment. In following up this\r\nabstemious mode of life, they never complain, but solace themselves with\r\nthe hope of reaching their native country, singing occasionally during\r\nthe journey, whenever they approach a habitation, or when the camels are\r\nfatigued. Their songs are usually sung _in trio_; and those of the\r\ncamel-drivers who have musical voices, join in the chorus. These songs\r\nhave a surprising effect in renovating the camels; while the symphony\r\nand time maintained by the singers, surpass what any one would conceive\r\nwho has not heard them. The day’s journey is terminated early in the\r\nafternoon, when the tents are pitched, prayers said, and the supper\r\nprepared by sunset. The guests now arrange themselves in a circle, and,\r\nthe sober meal being terminated, converse till they are overcome by\r\nsleep. At day-break next morning, they again proceed on their journey.\r\n\r\nIt might seem that these inhabitants of the desert would lead a\r\nmiserable life, and especially that they would often be swallowed up in\r\nthe terrific sand storms, which sometimes sweep over these wastes. The\r\nsand, being loose and dry, is borne upward by the whirling tempest, and\r\nis seen driving over the plain, like a terrific thunder-cloud. The\r\nexperienced traveler sees the coming danger, and prepares himself for\r\nit. He throws himself upon the ground, and covers his face so as not to\r\nbe choked with the dust. The horses and camels, guided by instinct, also\r\nput their noses to the earth to prevent being suffocated. If the storm\r\nis slight, the party escapes; but sometimes, such immense waves of sand\r\nare drifted upon the wind, as to bury the traveler deeply beneath it,\r\nand make it his winding-sheet forever. Sometimes whole caravans, with\r\ntheir horses and camels, have been in this manner overwhelmed; thus\r\nmaking the waves of the desert as fatal as the waves of the sea. Yet,\r\ndespite the terrors of the desert, the Arabs are a lively and cheerful\r\nrace. On their march, they stop at night; and in their tents, spread\r\nbeneath the starry canopy, the laugh, the jest and the song go round.\r\nThere are among them professed story-tellers, who delight the listeners\r\nwith fanciful tales of enchantment, adventure, and love, or perhaps they\r\nrepeat, in an animated manner, some fine specimens of Arabic poetry.\r\nThus it is, that mankind, occupying the gloomiest parts of the earth,\r\nhave amusements. As the steel is made to yield its spark, so the Arab\r\nfinds pleasure in the desert.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     PILGRIMAGE ACROSS THE DESERTS.\r\n\r\nThe following very lively description of a pilgrimage across the desert,\r\nis given by Ali Bey, in his travels in Morocco, Tripoli, &c. It is an\r\nanimated picture, which portrays in the strongest colors the perils and\r\nsufferings encountered in these enterprises.\r\n\r\n“We continued marching on in great haste, for fear of being overtaken by\r\nthe four hundred Arabs whom we wished to avoid. For this reason we never\r\nkept the common road, but passed through the middle of the desert,\r\nmarching through stony places, over easy hills. This country is entirely\r\nwithout water; not a tree is to be seen in it, not a rock which can\r\nafford a shelter or shade. A transparent atmosphere; an intense sun,\r\ndarting its beams upon our heads; a ground almost white, and commonly of\r\na concave form, like a burning-glass; slight breezes, scorching like a\r\nflame. Such is a faithful picture of this district, through which we\r\nwere passing. Every man we meet in this desert is looked upon as an\r\nenemy. Having discovered about noon a man in arms, on horseback, who\r\nkept at a certain distance, my thirteen Bedouins united the moment they\r\nperceived him, and darted like an arrow to overtake him, uttering loud\r\ncries, which they interrupted by expressions of contempt and derision;\r\nas, ‘What are you seeking, my brother?’ ‘Where are you going, my son?’\r\nAs they made these exclamations they kept playing with their guns above\r\ntheir heads. The discovered Bedouin profited by his advantage, and fled\r\ninto the mountains, where it was impossible to follow him. We met no one\r\nelse.\r\n\r\n“We had now neither eaten nor drank since the preceding day; our horses\r\nand other beasts were equally destitute; though ever since nine in the\r\nevening we had been traveling rapidly. Shortly after noon we had not a\r\ndrop of water remaining, and the men, as well as the poor animals, were\r\nworn out with fatigue. The mules, stumbling every moment, required\r\nassistance to lift them up again, and to support their burden till they\r\nrose. This terrible exertion exhausted the little strength we had left.\r\nAt two o’clock in the afternoon a man dropped down stiff, and as if\r\ndead, from great fatigue and thirst. I stopped with three or four of my\r\npeople to assist him. The little wet which was left in one of the\r\nleathern budgets, was squeezed out of it, and some drops of water poured\r\ninto the poor man’s mouth, but without any effect. I now felt that my\r\nown strength was beginning to forsake me; and becoming very weak, I\r\ndetermined to mount on horseback, leaving the poor fellow behind. From\r\nthis moment others of my caravan began to drop successively, and there\r\nwas no possibility of giving them any assistance; they were abandoned to\r\ntheir unhappy destiny, as every one thought only of saving himself.\r\nSeveral mules with their burdens were left behind, and I found on my way\r\ntwo of my trunks on the ground, without knowing what was become of the\r\nmules which had been carrying them, the drivers having forsaken them as\r\nwell as the care of my effects and of my instruments.\r\n\r\n“I looked upon this loss with the greatest indifference, as if they had\r\nnot belonged to me, and pushed on. But my horse began now to tremble\r\nunder me, and yet he was the strongest of the whole caravan. We\r\nproceeded in silent despair. When I endeavored to encourage any of the\r\nparty to increase his pace, he answered me by looking steadily at me,\r\nand by putting his fore-finger to his mouth to indicate the great thirst\r\nby which he was affected. As I was reproaching our conducting officers\r\nfor their inattention, which had occasioned this want of water, they\r\nexcused themselves by alleging the mutiny of the oudaias; and besides,\r\nadded they, ‘Do we not suffer like the rest?’ Our fate was the more\r\nshocking, as every one of us was sensible of the impossibility of\r\nsupporting the fatigue to the place where we were to meet with water\r\nagain. At last, at about four in the evening, I had my turn and fell\r\ndown with thirst and fatigue. Extended without consciousness on the\r\nground in the middle of the desert, left only with four or five men, one\r\nof whom had dropped at the same moment with myself, and all without any\r\nmeans of assisting me, because they knew not where to find water, and,\r\nif they had known it, had not strength to fetch it, I should have\r\nperished with them on the spot, if providence, by a kind of miracle, had\r\nnot preserved us.\r\n\r\n“Half an hour had already elapsed since I had fallen senseless to the\r\nground, (as I have since been told,) when, at some distance, a\r\nconsiderable caravan, of more than two thousand souls, was seen\r\nadvancing. It was under the direction of a marabout or saint called Sidi\r\nAlarbi, who was sent by the sultan to Ttemsen or Tremecen. Seeing us in\r\nthis distressed situation, he ordered some skins of water to be thrown\r\nover us. After I had received several of them over my face and hands, I\r\nrecovered my senses, opened my eyes, and looked around me, without being\r\nable to discern anybody. At last, however, I distinguished seven or\r\neight shereefs and faquirs, who gave me their assistance, and showed me\r\nmuch kindness. I endeavored to speak to them, but an invincible knot in\r\nmy throat seemed to hinder me; I could only make myself understood by\r\nsigns, and by pointing to my mouth with my finger. They continued\r\npouring water over my face, arms and hands, and at last I was able to\r\nswallow small mouthfuls. This enabled me to ask, ‘Who are you?’ When\r\nthey heard me speak, they expressed their joy, and answered me, ‘Fear\r\nnothing; far from being robbers, we are your friends;’ and every one\r\nmentioned his name. I began by degrees to recollect their faces, but was\r\nnot able to remember their names. They then poured over me a still\r\ngreater quantity of water, gave me some to drink, filled some of my\r\nleather bags, and left me in haste, as every minute spent in this place\r\nwas precious to them, and could not be repaired.\r\n\r\n“This attack of thirst is perceived all of a sudden by an extreme\r\naridity of the skin; the eyes appear to be bloody; the tongue and mouth,\r\nboth inside and outside, are covered with a crust of the thickness of a\r\ncrown piece; this crust is of a dark yellow color, of an insipid taste,\r\nand of a consistence like the soft wax from a beehive. A faintness or\r\nlanguor takes away the power to move; a kind of knot in the throat and\r\ndiaphragm, attended with great pain, interrupts respiration. Some\r\nwandering tears escape from the eyes, and at last the sufferer drops\r\ndown to the earth, and in a few moments loses all consciousness. These\r\nare the symptoms which I remarked in my unfortunate fellow-travelers,\r\nand which I experienced myself. I got with difficulty on my horse again,\r\nand we proceeded on our journey. My Bedouins and my faithful Salem were\r\ngone on different directions to find out some water, and two hours\r\nafterward they returned one after another, carrying along with them some\r\ngood or bad water, as they had been able to find it: every one presented\r\nto me part of what he had brought; I was obliged to taste it, and I\r\ndrank twenty times, but as soon as I swallowed it my mouth became as dry\r\nas before; at last I was not able either to spit or to speak.\r\n\r\n“The greatest part of the soil of the desert consists of pure clay,\r\nexcept some small traces of a calcareous nature. The whole surface is\r\ncovered with a bed of chalky, calcareous stone of a whitish color,\r\nsmooth, round and loose, and of the size of the fist; they are almost\r\nall of the same dimension, and their surface is carious like pieces of\r\nold mortar: I look upon this to be a true volcanic production. This bed\r\nis extended with such perfect regularity, that the whole desert is\r\ncovered with it; a circumstance which makes pacing over it very\r\nfatiguing to the traveler. No animal is to be seen in this desert,\r\nneither quadrupeds, birds, reptiles, nor insects, nor any plant\r\nwhatever; and the traveler who is obliged to pass through it, is\r\nsurrounded by the silence of death. It was not till four in the evening\r\nthat we began to distinguish some small plants burnt with the sun, and a\r\ntree of a thorny nature without blossom or fruit.”\r\n\r\nThe passage across the Nubian desert, is, in its general features, the\r\nsame as that over the great desert of Sahara. The following narrative is\r\nsomewhat abridged from Bayard Taylor’s “Journey to Central Africa.” “My\r\nlittle caravan consisted of six camels, including that of the guide. We\r\npassed the miserable hamlet of Korosko, turned a corner of the mountain\r\nchain into a narrow, stony valley, and in a few minutes lost sight of\r\nthe Nile and his belt of palms. Thenceforward, for many days, the only\r\ngreen thing to be seen in the wilderness was myself. The first day’s\r\njourney lay among rugged hills, thrown together in confusion, with no\r\napparent system or direction. They were of jet black sandstone, and\r\nresembled immense piles of coke or anthracite. The small glens and\r\nbasins inclosed in this chaos, were filled with glowing yellow sand,\r\nwhich, in many places, streamed down the crevices of the black rocks,\r\nlike rivulets of fire. The path was strewn with hollow globes of hard,\r\nblack stones, precisely resembling cannon-balls. The guide gave me one\r\nof the size of a rifle bullet, with a seam around the center, as if cast\r\nin a mold. The thermometer showed a temperature of eighty degrees at two\r\no’clock in the afternoon, but the heat was tempered by a pure fresh\r\nbreeze. After eight hours’ travel, I made my first camp, at sunset, in a\r\nlittle hollow inclosed by the mountains, where a gray jackal, after\r\nbeing twice shot at, came and looked into the door of the tent.\r\n\r\n“I found dromedary-riding not at all difficult. One sits on a very lofty\r\nseat, with his feet crossed over the animal’s shoulders, or resting on\r\nhis neck. The body is obliged to rock backward and forward, on account\r\nof the long, swinging gait; and as there is no stay or fulcrum, except a\r\nblunt pommel, around which the legs are crossed, some little power of\r\nequilibrium is necessary. My dromedary was a strong, stately beast, of a\r\nlight cream color, and of so even a gait that it would bear the Arab\r\ntest: that is, one might drink a cup of coffee while going on a full\r\ntrot, without spilling a drop. I found great advantage in the use of the\r\noriental costume. My trowsers allowed the legs perfect freedom of\r\nmotion, and I soon learned so many different modes of crossing those\r\nmembers that no day was sufficient to exhaust them. The rising and\r\nkneeling of the animal is hazardous at first, as his long legs double\r\ntogether like a carpenter’s rule, and you are thrown backward and then\r\nforward, and then backward again; but the trick is soon learned. The\r\nsoreness and fatigue of which many travelers complain, I never felt; and\r\nI attribute much of it to the Frank dress. I rode from eight to ten\r\nhours a day, read and even dreamed in the saddle, and was at night as\r\nfresh and unwearied as when I mounted in the morning.\r\n\r\n“My caravan was accompanied by four Arabs. They owned the burden camels,\r\nwhich they urged along with the cry of ‘Yoho! Shekh Abd-el Kader!’ and a\r\nshrill barbaric song, the refrain of which was, ‘O prophet of God, help\r\nthe camels, and bring us safely to our journey’s end!’ They were very\r\nsusceptible to cold, and a temperature of fifty degrees, which we\r\nfrequently had in the morning, made them tremble like aspen leaves, and\r\nthey were sometimes so benumbed that they could scarcely lead the\r\ncamels. They wore long swords, carried in a leathern scabbard over the\r\nleft shoulder, and sometimes favored us with a war-dance, which\r\nconsisted merely in springing into the air with a brandished sword, and\r\nturning round once before coming down. They were all very devout,\r\nretiring a short distance from the road to say their prayers, at the\r\nusual hours, and performing the prescribed ablutions with sand instead\r\nof water. On the second morning, we passed through a gorge in the black\r\nhills, and entered a region called _El Biban_, or ‘The Gates.’ Here the\r\nmountains, though still grouped in the same disorder, were more open,\r\nand gave room to plains of sand several miles in length. The narrow\r\nopenings, through which the road passes from one plain to another, gave\r\nrise to the name. The mountains are higher than on the Nile, and present\r\nthe most wonderful configurations: towers, fortresses, walls, pyramids,\r\ntemples in ruin, of an inky blackness near at hand, but tinged of a\r\ndeep, glowing violet hue in the distance. Toward noon I saw a _mirage_,\r\na lake in which the broken peaks were reflected with great distinctness.\r\nOne of the Nubians who was with us, pointed out a spot where he was\r\nobliged to climb the rocks, the previous summer, to avoid being drowned.\r\nDuring the heavy tropical rains which sometimes fall here, the hundreds\r\nof pyramidal hills pour down such floods that the sand can not\r\nimmediately drink them up, and the valleys are turned into lakes. The\r\nman described the roaring of the waters, down the clefts of the rocks,\r\nas something terrible. In summer the passage of the desert is much more\r\narduous than in winter, and many men and camels perish. The road was\r\nstrewn with bones and carcasses, and I frequently counted twenty dead\r\ncamels within a stone’s throw. The stone-heaps which are seen on all the\r\nspurs of the hills, as landmarks for caravans, have become useless,\r\nsince one could find his way by the bones in the sand. My guide, who was\r\na great believer in afrites and devils, said that formerly many persons\r\nlost the way and perished from thirst, all of which was the work of evil\r\nspirits. Toward noon, on the third day, we passed the last of the\r\n‘gates,’ and entered the _Bahr bela Ma_, (river without water,) a broad\r\nplain of burning yellow sand. The gateway is very imposing, especially\r\non the eastern side, where it is broken by a valley or gorge of\r\nTartarean blackness. As we passed the last peak, my guide, who had\r\nridden in advance, dismounted beside what seemed to be a collection of\r\ngraves—little ridges of sand, with rough head and foot stones. He sat by\r\none which he had just made. As I came up he informed me that all\r\ntravelers who crossed the Nubian desert, for the first time, are here\r\nexpected to pay a toll, or fee to the guide and camel-men. ‘But what if\r\nI do not choose to pay?’ I asked. ‘Then you will immediately perish, and\r\nbe buried here. The graves are those of persons who refused to pay.’ As\r\nI had no wish to occupy the beautiful mound he had heaped for me, with\r\nthe thigh-bones of a camel at the head and foot, I gave the men a few\r\npiasters, and passed the place. He then plucked up the bones and threw\r\nthem away, and restored the sand to its original level.[8]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 8:\r\n\r\n  “Burckhardt gives the following account of the same custom, in his\r\n  travels in Nubia. ‘In two hours and a half we came to a plain on the\r\n  top of the mountain called _Akabet el Benat_, the Rocks of the Girls.\r\n  Here the Arabs who serve as guides through these mountains, have\r\n  devised a singular mode of extorting presents from the traveler: they\r\n  alight at certain spots in the Akabet El Benat, and beg a present; if\r\n  it is refused, they collect a heap of sand, and mold it into the form\r\n  of a diminutive tomb, and then placing a stone at each of the\r\n  extremities, they apprise the traveler that his tomb is made; meaning,\r\n  that henceforward, there will be no security for him, in this rocky\r\n  wilderness. Most persons pay a trifling contribution, rather than have\r\n  their graves made before their eyes; there were, however, several\r\n  tombs of this description dispersed over the plain.’”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n“The _Bahr bela Ma_ spread out before us, glittering in the hot sun.\r\nAbout a mile to the eastward lay (apparently) a lake of blue water.\r\nReeds and water-plants grew on its margin, and its smooth surface\r\nreflected the rugged outline of the hill beyond. The waterless river is\r\nabout two miles in breadth, and appears to have been at one time the bed\r\nof a large stream. It crosses all the caravan routes in the desert, and\r\nis supposed to extend from the Nile to the Red sea. It may have been the\r\noutlet for the river, before its waters forced a passage through the\r\nprimitive chains which cross its bed at Assouan and Kalabshee. A\r\ngeological exploration of this part of Africa could not fail to produce\r\nvery interesting results. Beyond the _Bahr bela Ma_ extends the broad\r\ncentral plateau of the desert, fifteen hundred feet above the sea. It is\r\na vast reach of yellow sand, dotted with low, isolated hills, which in\r\nsome places are based on large beds of light-gray sandstone of an\r\nunusually fine and even grain. Small towers of stone have been erected\r\non the hills nearest the road, in order to guide the couriers who travel\r\nby night. Near one of them the guide pointed out the grave of a\r\nmerchant, who had been murdered there two years previous, by his three\r\nslaves. The latter escaped into the desert, but probably perished, as\r\nthey were never heard of afterward. In the smooth, loose sand, I had an\r\nopportunity of reviving my forgotten knowledge of trackography, and soon\r\nlearned to distinguish the feet of hyenas, foxes, ostriches, lame camels\r\nand other animals. The guide assured me that there were devils in the\r\ndesert; but one only sees them when he travels alone.\r\n\r\n“On this plain the mirage, which first appeared in the _Biban_,\r\npresented itself under a variety of wonderful aspects. Thenceforth, I\r\nsaw it every day, for hours together, and tried to deduce some rules\r\nfrom the character of its phenomena. It appears on all sides, except\r\nthat directly opposite to the sun, but rarely before nine in the\r\nmorning, or after three of the afternoon. The color of the apparent\r\nwater is always precisely that of the sky, and this is a good test to\r\ndistinguish it from real water, which is invariably of a deeper hue. It\r\nis seen on a gravelly as well as a sandy surface, and often fills with\r\nshining pools the slight depressions in the soil at the bases of the\r\nhills. Where it extends to the horizon there is no apparent line, and it\r\nthen becomes an inlet of the sky, as if the walls of heaven were melting\r\ndown and flowing in upon the earth. Sometimes a whole mountain chain is\r\nlifted from the horizon and hung in the air, with its reflected image\r\njoined to it, base to base. I frequently saw, during the forenoon, lakes\r\nof sparkling blue water, apparently not a quarter of a mile distant.[9]\r\nThe waves ripple in the wind; tall reeds and water-plants grow on the\r\nmargin, and the desert rocks behind cast their shadows on the surface.\r\nIt is impossible to believe it a delusion. You advance nearer, and\r\nsuddenly, you know not how, the lake vanishes. There is a grayish film\r\nover the spot, but before you have decided whether the film is in the\r\nair or in your eyes, that too disappears, and you see only the naked\r\nsand. What you took to be reeds and water-plants probably shows itself\r\nas a streak of dark gravel. The most probable explanation of the mirage\r\nwhich I could think of, was, that it was actually a reflection of the\r\nsky upon a stratum of heated air, next the sand.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 9:\r\n\r\n  In a previous chapter, Taylor says: “Before returning on board, we saw\r\n  a wonderful _mirage_. Two lakes of blue water, glittering in the sun,\r\n  lay spread in the yellow sands, apparently not more than a mile\r\n  distant. There was not the least sign of vapor in the air; and as we\r\n  were quite unacquainted with the appearance of the mirage, we decided\r\n  that the lakes were Nile water, left from the inundation. I pointed to\r\n  them, and asked the Arabs, ‘Is that water?’ ‘No, no!’ they all\r\n  exclaimed; ‘that is no water; that is _Bar Shaytan_,’ a river of the\r\n  devil!”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n“I found the desert life not only endurable but very agreeable. No\r\nmatter how warm it might be at midday, the nights were always fresh and\r\ncool, and the wind blew strong from the north-west, during the greater\r\npart of the time. The temperature varied from fifty or fifty-five\r\ndegrees at six in the morning, to eighty or eighty-five degrees at two\r\nin the afternoon. The extremes were forty-seven and a hundred degrees.\r\nSo great a change of temperature every day was not so unpleasant as\r\nmight be supposed. In my case, Nature seemed to make a special provision\r\nin order to keep the balance right. During the hot hours of the day I\r\nnever suffered inconvenience from the heat, but up to eighty-five\r\ndegrees felt sufficiently cool. I seemed to absorb the rays of the sun,\r\nand as night came on and the temperature of the air fell, that of my\r\nskin rose, till at last I glowed through and through, like a live coal.\r\nIt was a peculiar sensation, which I never experienced before, but was\r\nrather pleasant than otherwise. My face, however, which was alternately\r\nexposed to the heat radiated from the sand, and the keen morning wind,\r\ncould not accommodate itself to so much contraction and expansion. The\r\nskin cracked and peeled off more than once, and I was obliged to rub it\r\ndaily with butter. I mounted my dromedary with a ‘shining morning face,’\r\nuntil, from alternate buttering and burning, it attained the hue and\r\ncrispness of a well-basted partridge.\r\n\r\n“I soon fell into a regular daily routine of travel, which, during all\r\nmy later experiences of the desert, never became monotonous. I rose at\r\ndawn every morning, bathed my eyes with a handful of the precious water,\r\nand drank a cup of coffee. After the tent had been struck and the camels\r\nladen, I walked ahead for two hours, often so far in advance that I lost\r\nsight and hearing of the caravan. I found an unspeakable fascination in\r\nthe sublime solitude of the desert. I often beheld the sun rise, when,\r\nwithin the wide ring of the horizon, there was no other living creature\r\nto be seen. He came up in awful glory, and it would have been a natural\r\nact, had I cast myself upon the sand and worshiped him. The sudden\r\nchange in the coloring of the landscape, on his appearance, the lighting\r\nup of the dull sand into a warm golden hue, and the tintings of purple\r\nand violet on the distant porphyry hills, was a morning miracle, which I\r\nnever beheld without awe. The richness of this coloring made the desert\r\nbeautiful; it was too brilliant for desolation. The scenery, so far from\r\ndepressing, inspired and exhilarated me. I never felt the sensation of\r\nphysical health and strength in such perfection, and was ready to shout\r\nfrom morning till night, from the overflow of happy spirits. The air is\r\nan elixir of life, as sweet and pure and refreshing as that which the\r\nfirst man breathed, on the morning of creation. You inhale the\r\nunadulterated elements of the atmosphere, for there are no exhalations\r\nfrom moist earth, vegetable matter, or the smokes and steams which arise\r\nfrom the abodes of men, to stain its purity. This air, even more than\r\nits silence and solitude, is the secret of one’s attachment to the\r\ndesert. It is a beautiful illustration of the compensating care of that\r\nprovidence which leaves none of the waste places of the earth without\r\nsome atoning glory. Where all the pleasant aspects of nature are\r\nwanting; where there is no green thing, no fount for the thirsty lip,\r\nscarcely the shadow of a rock to shield the wanderer in the blazing\r\nnoon; God has breathed upon the wilderness his sweetest and tenderest\r\nbreath, giving clearness to the eye, strength to the frame, and the most\r\njoyous exhilaration to the spirits.\r\n\r\n“Achmet always insisted on my taking a saber as a protection against the\r\nhyenas, but I was never so fortunate as to see more than their tracks,\r\nwhich crossed the path at every step. I saw occasionally the footprints\r\nof ostriches, but they, as well as the giraffe, are scarce in this\r\ndesert. Toward noon, we made a halt in the shadow of a rock, or if no\r\nrock was at hand, on the bare sand, and took our breakfast. One’s daily\r\nbread is never sweeter than in the desert. The rest of the day I jogged\r\nalong patiently beside the baggage camels, and at sunset halted for the\r\nnight. A divan on the sand, and a well-filled pipe, gave me patience\r\nwhile dinner was preparing, and afterward I made the necessary entries\r\nin my journal. I had no need to court sleep, after being rocked all day\r\non the dromedary. Until noon of the fourth day we journeyed over a vast\r\nplain of sand, interrupted by low reefs of black rock. Soon after midday\r\nthe plain was broken by low ranges of hills, and we saw in front and to\r\nthe east of us many blue mountain-chains. Our road approached one of\r\nthem, a range, several miles in length, the highest peak of which\r\nreached an altitude of a thousand feet. The sides were precipitous and\r\nformed of vertical strata, but the crests were agglomerations of loose\r\nstones, as if shaken out of some enormous coal-scuttle. The glens and\r\ngorges were black as ink; no speck of any other color relieved the\r\nterrible gloom of this singular group of hills. Their aspect was much\r\nmore than sterile: it was infernal. The name given to them by the guide\r\nwas _Djilet e’ Djindee_, the meaning of which I could not learn. At\r\ntheir foot I found a few thorny shrubs, the first sign of vegetation\r\nsince leaving Korosko. We encamped half an hour before sunset on a\r\ngravelly plain, between two spurs of the savage hills, in order that our\r\ncamels might browse on the shrubs, and they were only too ready to take\r\nadvantage of the permission. They snapped off the hard, dry twigs,\r\nstudded with cruel thorns, and devoured them as if their tongues were\r\nmade of cast-iron. We were now in the haunts of the gazelle and the\r\nostrich, but saw nothing of them.\r\n\r\n“On the fifth day we left the plain, and entered a country of broken\r\nmountain-ranges. In one place the road passed through a long, low hill\r\nof slate rock, by a gap which had been purposely broken. The strata were\r\nvertical, the laminæ varying from one to four inches in thickness, and\r\nof as fine a quality and smooth a surface as I ever saw. A long wady, or\r\nvalley, which appeared to be the outlet of some mountain-basin, was\r\ncrossed by a double row of stunted doum-palms, marking a water-course\r\nmade by the summer rains. Eyoub pointed it out to me, as the half-way\r\nstation between Korosko and Abou-Hammed. For two hours longer we\r\nthreaded the dry wadys, shut in by black, chaotic hills. It was now\r\nnoonday, I was very hungry, and the time allotted by Eyoub for reaching\r\n_Bir Mûrr-hàt_ had passed. He saw my impatience and urged his dromedary\r\ninto a trot, calling out to me to follow him. We bent to the west,\r\nturned the flank of a high range, and after half an hour’s steady\r\ntrotting, reached a side-valley or _cul-de-sac_, branching off from the\r\nmain wady. A herd of loose camels, a few goats, two black camel’s-hair\r\ntents, and half a dozen half-naked Ababdehs, showed that we had reached\r\nthe wells. A few shallow pits, dug in the center of the valley,\r\nfurnished an abundance of bitter, greenish water, which the camels\r\ndrank, but which I could not drink. The wells are called by the Arabs\r\n_el morra_, ‘the bitter.’ Fortunately, I had two skins of Nile-water\r\nleft, which, with care, would last to Abou-Hammed. The water was always\r\ncool and fresh, though in color and taste it resembled a decoction of\r\nold shoes. We left Mûrr-hàt at sunrise, on the morning of the sixth day.\r\nI walked ahead, through the foldings of the black mountains, singing as\r\nI went, from the inspiration of the brilliant sky and the pure air. In\r\nan hour and a half, the pass opened on a broad plain of sand, and I\r\nwaited for my caravan, as the day was growing hot. On either side, as we\r\ncontinued our journey, the blue lakes of the mirage glittered in the\r\nsun. Several isolated pyramids rose above the horizon, far to the east,\r\nand a purple mountain-range in front, apparently two or three hours\r\ndistant, stretched from east to west. ‘We will breakfast in the shade of\r\nthose mountains,’ I said to Achmet, but breakfast-time came and they\r\nseemed no nearer, so I sat down in the sand and made my meal. Toward\r\nnoon we met large caravans of camels, coming from Berber. Some were\r\nladen with gum, but the greater part were without burdens, as they were\r\nto be sold in Egypt. In the course of the day upward of a thousand\r\npassed us. The afternoon was intensely hot, the thermometer standing at\r\none hundred degrees, but I felt little annoyance from the heat, and used\r\nno protection against it. The sand was deep and the road a weary one for\r\nthe camels, but the mountains which seemed so near at hand in the\r\nmorning were not yet reached. We pushed forward; the sun went down, and\r\nthe twilight was over before we encamped at their base. The tent was\r\npitched by the light of the crescent moon, which hung over a\r\npitchy-black peak. I had dinner at the fashionable hour of seven. Achmet\r\nwas obliged to make soup of the water of Mûrr-hàt, which had an\r\nabominable taste. I was so drowsy that before my pipe was finished, I\r\ntumbled upon my mattress, and was unconscious until midnight, when I\r\nawoke with the sensation of swimming in a river of lava.\r\n\r\n“The tent was struck in the morning starlight, at which time the\r\nthermometer stood at fifty-five degrees. I walked alone through the\r\nmountains, which rose in conical peaks to the hight of near a thousand\r\nfeet. The path was rough and stony until I reached the outlet of the\r\npass. On leaving the mountain, we entered a plain of coarse gravel,\r\nabounding with pebbles of agate and jasper. Another range, which Eyoub\r\ncalled Djebel Dighlee, appeared in front, and we reached it about noon.\r\nThe day was again hot, the mercury rising to ninety-five degrees. It\r\ntook us nearly an hour to pass Djebel Dighlee, beyond which the plain\r\nstretched away to the Nile, interrupted here and there by a distant\r\npeak. Far in advance of us lay Djebel Mokràt, the limit of the next\r\nday’s journey. From its top, said Eyoub, one may see the palm-groves\r\nalong the Nile. We encamped on the open plain, not far from two black\r\npyramidal hills, in the flush of a superb sunset. The ground was\r\ntraversed by broad strata of gray granite, which lay on the surface in\r\nhuge bowlders. Our camels here found a few bunches of dry, yellow grass,\r\nwhich had pierced the gravelly soil. To the south-east was a mountain\r\ncalled by the Arabs _Djebel Nogàra_, (the mountain of the Drum,)\r\nbecause, as Eyoub declared, a devil who had his residence among its\r\nrocks, frequently beat a drum at night, to scare the passing caravans.\r\n\r\n“The stars were sparkling freshly and clearly when I rose, on the\r\nmorning of the eighth day, and Djebel Mokràt lay like a faint shadow on\r\nthe southern horizon. The sun revealed a few isolated peaks to the right\r\nand left, but merely distant isles on the vast, smooth ocean of the\r\ndesert. It was a rapture to breathe air of such transcendent purity and\r\nsweetness. I breakfasted on the immense floor, sitting in the sun, and\r\nthen jogged on all day, in a heat of ninety degrees, toward Djebel\r\nMokràt, which seemed as far off as ever. The sun went down, and it was\r\nstill ahead of us. ‘That is a _Djebel Shaytan_,’ I said to Eyoub; ‘or\r\nrather, it is no mountain; it is an afrite.’ ‘O effendi!’ said the old\r\nman, ‘don’t speak of afrites here. There are many in this part of the\r\ndesert, and if a man travels alone here at night, one of them walks\r\nbehind him and forces him to go forward and forward, until he has lost\r\nhis path.’ We rode on by the light of the moon and stars; and two hours\r\nafter sunset, we _killed_ Djebel Mokràt, as the Arabs say: that is,\r\nturned its corner. The weary camels were let loose among some clumps of\r\ndry, rustling reeds, and I stretched myself out on the sand, after\r\ntwelve hours in the saddle. Our water was nearly exhausted by this time,\r\nand the provisions were reduced to hermits’ fare, bread, rice and dates.\r\nI had, however, the spice of a savage appetite, which was no sooner\r\nappeased, than I fell into a profound sleep. I could not but admire the\r\nindomitable pluck of the little donkeys owned by the Kenoos. These\r\nanimals not only carried provisions and water for themselves and their\r\nmasters, the whole distance, but the latter rode them the greater part\r\nof the way; yet they kept up with the camels, plying their little legs\r\nas ambitiously the last day as the first. I doubt whether a horse would\r\nhave accomplished as much under similar circumstances.\r\n\r\n“The next morning we started joyfully, in hope of seeing the Nile; and\r\neven Eyoub, for the first time since leaving Korosko, helped to load the\r\ncamels. In an hour we passed the mountain of Mokràt, but the same\r\nendless plain of yellow gravel extended before us to the horizon. Eyoub\r\nhad promised that we should reach Abou-Hammed in half a day, and even\r\npointed out some distant blue mountains in the south, as being beyond\r\nthe Nile. Nevertheless, we traveled nearly till noon without any change\r\nof scenery, and no more appearance of river than the abundant streams of\r\nthe mirage, on all sides. I drank my last cup of water for breakfast,\r\nand then continued my march in the burning sun, with rather dismal\r\nspirits. Finally, the desert, which had been rising since we left the\r\nmountain, began to descend, and I saw something like round granite\r\nbowlders lying on the edge of the horizon. ‘Effendi, see the\r\ndoum-trees!’ cried Eyoub. I looked again: they _were_ doum-palms, and so\r\nbroad and green that they must certainly stand near water. Soon we\r\ndescended into a hollow in the plain, looking down which I saw to the\r\nsouth a thick grove of trees, and over their tops the shining surface of\r\nthe Nile. ‘Ali,’ I called to my sailor-servant, ‘look at that great\r\n_bahr shaytan_!’ The son of the Nile, who had never before, in all his\r\nlife, been more than a day out of sight of its current, was almost\r\nbeside himself with joy. ‘Wallah, master,’ he cried; ‘that is no river\r\nof the devil: it is the real Nile, the water of Paradise.’ It did my\r\nheart good to see his extravagant delight. ‘If you were to give me five\r\npiasters, master,’ said he, ‘I would not drink the bitter water of\r\nMûrr-hàt.’ The guide made me a salutation, in his dry way, and the two\r\nNubians greeted me with ‘A great welcome to you, O effendi!’ With every\r\nstep the valley unfolded before me; such rich deeps of fanlike foliage,\r\nsuch a glory in the green of the beans and lupines, such radiance beyond\r\ndescription in the dance of the sunbeams on the water! The landscape was\r\nbalm to my burning eyes, and the mere sight of the glorious green\r\nherbage was a sensuous delight, in which I rioted for the rest of the\r\nday.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                          SANDS OF THE DESERT.\r\n\r\n         “Now o’er their head the whizzing whirlwinds breathe,\r\n         And the live desert pants and heaves beneath;\r\n         Tinged by the crimson sun, vast columns rise\r\n         Of eddying sands, and war amid the skies,\r\n         In red arcades the billowy plain surround,\r\n         And stalking turrets dance upon the ground.”—DARWIN.\r\n\r\nIn the pathless desert, high mounds of sand, shifting with every change\r\nof wind, surround the traveler on every side, and conceal from his view\r\nall other objects. There the wind is of a surprising rapidity; and the\r\nsand is so extremely fine, that it forms on the ground waves which\r\nresemble those of the sea. These waves rise up so fast, that in a very\r\nfew hours a hill of from twenty to thirty feet high is transported from\r\none place to another. The shifting of these hills, however, does not\r\ntake place on a sudden, as is generally believed, and is not by any\r\nmeans capable of surprising and burying a caravan while on the march.\r\nThe mode in which the transposition of the hills takes place is not\r\ndifficult of explanation. The wind sweeping the sand from the surface\r\ncontinually, and that with an astonishing rapidity, the ground lowers\r\nevery moment: but the quantity of sand in the air increasing as quickly\r\nby successive waves, can not support itself there, but falls in heaps,\r\nand forms a new hill, leaving the place it before occupied level, and\r\nwith the appearance of having been swept.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to guard the eyes and mouth against the quantity of sand\r\nwhich is always flying about in the air; and the traveler has to seek\r\nthe right direction, to avoid being lost in the windings made in the\r\nmiddle of the hills of sand which bound the sight, and which shift from\r\none spot to another so often, as not to leave anything to be seen\r\nbesides the sky and sand, without any mark by which the position can be\r\nknown. Even the deepest footstep in the sand of either man or horse\r\ndisappears the moment the foot is raised. The immensity, the swiftness,\r\nand the everlasting motion of these waves when the wind is blowing,\r\ndisturb the sight both of men and beasts, so that they are almost\r\ncontinually marching as if in the dark. The camel gives here a proof of\r\nhis great superiority; his long neck, perpendicularly erected, removes\r\nhis head from the ground, and from the thick part of the waves; his eyes\r\nare well defended by thick eye-lids, largely provided with hair, and\r\nwhich he keeps half shut; the construction of his feet, broad and\r\ncushion-like, prevents his treading deep into the sand; his long legs\r\nenable him to pass the same space with only half the number of steps of\r\nany other animal, and therefore with less fatigue. These advantages give\r\nhim a solid and easy gait, on a ground where all other animals walk with\r\nslow, short, and uncertain steps, and in a tottering manner. Hence the\r\ncamel, intended by nature for these journeys, affords a new motive of\r\npraise to the Creator, who in his wisdom has given the camel to the\r\nAfrican, as he has bestowed the reindeer on the Laplander.\r\n\r\nLieutenant Pottinger, in his travels in Beloochistan, a province of\r\nIndia, gives the following interesting account of those curious\r\nphenomena. He had to pass over a desert of red sand, the particles of\r\nwhich were so light, that when taken in the hand they were scarcely more\r\nthan palpable, the whole being thrown by the winds into an irregular\r\nmass of waves, principally running east and west, and varying in hight\r\nfrom ten to twenty feet. The greater part of them rose perpendicularly\r\non the opposite side to that from which the prevailing north-west wind\r\nblew, and might readily have been fancied, at a distance, to resemble a\r\nnew brick wall. The side facing the wind sloped off with a gradual\r\ndeclivity toward the base of the next windward wave, and then again\r\nascended in a straight line, in the same extraordinary manner as above\r\ndescribed, so as to form a hollow or path between them. Our traveler\r\nkept as much in these paths as the direction he had to take would allow;\r\nbut it was not without great difficulty and fatigue that the camels were\r\nurged over the waves, when it was requisite to do so, and more\r\nparticularly when they had to clamber up the leeward or perpendicular\r\nface of them, in attempting which they were often defeated. On the\r\noblique or shelving side they ascended pretty well, their broad feet\r\nsaving them from sinking deeper than did the travelers themselves; and\r\nthe instant they found the top of the wave giving way from their weight,\r\nthey most expertly dropped on their knees, and in that posture gently\r\nslid down with the sand, which was luckily so unconnected, that the\r\nleading camel usually caused a sufficient breach for the others to\r\nfollow on foot. The night was spent under shelter of one of these sand\r\nwaves, the surrounding atmosphere being uncommonly hot and close.\r\n\r\nOn the following day, in crossing a desert of the same description, the\r\nlike impediments occurred; but these were trifling compared with the\r\ndistress suffered, not only by our traveler and his people, but also by\r\nthe camels, from the floating particles of sand; a phenomenon for which\r\nhe confesses himself at a loss to account. When he first observed it, in\r\nthe morning, the desert appeared to have, at the distance of half a mile\r\nor less, an elevated and flat surface from six to twelve inches higher\r\nthan the summits of the sand waves. This vapor appeared to recede as he\r\nadvanced, and once or twice completely encircled his party, limiting the\r\nhorizon to a very confined space, and conveying a most gloomy and\r\nunnatural sensation to the mind of the beholders, who were at the same\r\nmoment imperceptibly covered with innumerable atoms of small sand, which\r\ngetting into the eyes, mouth and nostrils, caused excessive irritation,\r\nattended by an extreme thirst, which was increased in no small degree by\r\nthe intense heat of the sun. This annoyance is supposed by the natives\r\nto originate in the solar beams causing the dust of the desert, as they\r\nemphatically call it, to rise and float through the air; a notion which\r\nappears to be in a great measure correct, this sandy ocean being only\r\nvisible during the hottest part of the day. The following simple theory\r\nof these moving sands is submitted by the author. When the violent\r\nwhirlwinds which prevail in the desert, terminate in gusts of wind, they\r\nusually expand over several square miles of surface, raging with\r\nirresistible force, and bearing upward an immense body of sand, which\r\ndescends as the current of air that gave it action dies away, thus\r\ncreating the extraordinary appearance in question. If it should be asked\r\nwhat prevents the sand from subsiding altogether, when it has so far\r\naccomplished this as to rest apparently on the waves, the answer is,\r\nthat all the grosser particles do settle, but that the more minute ones\r\nbecome rarefied to such a degree by the heat produced by the burning\r\nsand on the red soil, that they remain as it were in an undecided and\r\nundulating state, until the returning temperature restores their\r\nspecific gravity; when, by an undeviating law of nature, they sink to\r\nthe earth. This in some measure coincides with the opinion of the native\r\nBrahoes; but, conformably to their notion, it is evident that the\r\nfloating sands would be apparent at all periods of excessive solar\r\ninfluence; which not being the case, it becomes necessary to find a\r\nprimary cause for the phenomenon. To remove any suspicion of his having\r\nbeen deceived in the reality of this floating vapor of sand, he adds\r\nthat he has seen this phenomenon, and the _shurab_, or watery illusion\r\nso frequent in deserts, called by the French _mirage_, in opposite\r\nquarters at the same moment, each of them being to his sight perfectly\r\ndistinct. While the former had a cloudy and dim aspect, the latter was\r\nluminous, and could not be mistaken for water. To corroborate what he\r\nhas here advanced, he states that he was afterward joined by a faquir\r\nfrom Kaboul, who informed him that he had witnessed the moving sands, in\r\npassing through the desert from Seistan, to a much greater degree than\r\nhas been described; and, what is scarcely credible, he spoke of having\r\nbeen forced to sit down, in consequence of the density of the cloud in\r\nwhich he was enveloped.\r\n\r\nOur traveler next proceeds to a curious description of the pillars or\r\ncolumns of sand formed in the deserts. He experienced a violent tornado,\r\nor gust of wind, which came on so suddenly, that, if he had not been\r\napprised of its strength by the guide, it might have been disastrous to\r\nhis party, in whom it would have been an act of temerity to have\r\nendeavored to sit on the camels during its impetuous fury. Before it\r\nbegan, the sky was clear, save a few small clouds in the north-west\r\nquarter; and the only warnings it afforded, were the oppressive\r\nsultriness of the air, and a vast number of whirlwinds springing up on\r\nall sides. These whirlwinds, he observes, might perhaps be more\r\ncorrectly expressed by some other name; but as the wind issued from them\r\nhe adopts the term. They are vast columns of sand, which begin by a\r\ntrifling agitation, with a revolving motion on the surface of the\r\ndesert, and gradually ascend and expand, until their tops are lost to\r\nthe view. In this manner they move about with every breath of wind, and\r\nare observed, thirty or forty of them at the same time, of different\r\ndimensions, apparently from one to twenty yards in diameter. Those who\r\nhave seen a waterspout at sea, may exactly conceive the same formed of\r\nsand on shore. The moment the guide saw the whirlwinds disperse, which\r\nthey did as if by magic, and a cloud of dust approaching, he advised the\r\nparty to dismount, which they had hardly time to do, and lodge\r\nthemselves snugly behind the camels, when a storm burst upon them with a\r\nfurious blast of wind, the rain falling in huge drops, and the air being\r\nso completely darkened, that they were unable to discern any object at\r\nthe distance of even five yards.\r\n\r\nThe following is Bruce’s account of this singular phenomenon, which he\r\nrepresents as one of the most magnificent spectacles imaginable, and by\r\nwhich he and his companions were at once surprised and terrified. Having\r\nreached the vast expanse of desert which lies to the west and north-west\r\nof Chendi, they saw a number of prodigious pillars of sand at different\r\ndistances, at times moving with great celerity, and at others stalking\r\non with a majestic slowness. At intervals the party thought they should\r\nbe overwhelmed by these sand-pillars; and small quantities of sand did\r\nactually more than once reach them. Again, they would retreat so as to\r\nbe almost out of sight, their summits reaching the very clouds. There\r\nthe tops often separated from the bodies; and these once disjointed,\r\ndispersed in the air, and did not appear more. They were sometimes\r\nbroken near the middle, as if struck by a large cannon-shot. About noon\r\nthey began to advance with considerable swiftness upon the party, the\r\nwind being very strong at north. Eleven of them ranged alongside, at\r\nabout the distance of three miles from them; and at this interval the\r\ngreatest diameter of the largest of them appeared to Mr. Bruce to be\r\nabout ten feet. They retired with a wind at south-east, leaving an\r\nimpression on our traveler’s mind, to which he could give no name,\r\nthough assuredly one of its ingredients was fear, blended with a\r\nconsiderable portion of wonder and surprise. It was in vain to think of\r\nfleeing: the swiftest horse, or fastest sailing ship, would have been of\r\nno use in rescuing him from his danger. The full persuasion of this\r\nriveted him as it were to the spot where he stood, and he allowed the\r\ncamels to gain on him so much, that it was with difficulty he could\r\novertake them. On a subsequent occasion, an assemblage of these moving\r\npillars of sand, more numerous, but less in size than the former,\r\napproached Mr. Bruce’s party soon after sunrise, and appeared like a\r\nthick wood. They almost darkened the sun, the rays of which, shining\r\nthrough them for nearly an hour, gave them an appearance of pillars of\r\nfire. His people became desperate, some saying it was the day of\r\njudgment, and others, that the world was on fire.\r\n\r\nDr. Clarke, in his travels in Egypt, thus describes this phenomenon.\r\n“One of those immense columns of sand, mentioned by Bruce, came rapidly\r\ntoward us, turning upon its base as upon a pivot: it crossed the Nile so\r\nnear us, that the whirlwind by which it was carried, placed our vessel\r\nupon its beam-ends, bearing its large sail quite into the water, and\r\nnearly upsetting the boat. As we were engaged in righting the vessel,\r\nthe column disappeared. It is probable that those columns do not fall\r\nsuddenly upon any particular spot, so as to be capable of overwhelming\r\nan army or a caravan; but that, as the sand, thus driven, is gradually\r\naccumulated, it becomes gradually dispersed, and the column, diminishing\r\nin its progress, at length disappears. A great quantity of sand is no\r\ndoubt precipitated, as the effect which gathers it becomes weaker; but,\r\nfrom witnessing such phenomena upon a smaller scale, it does not seem\r\nlikely that the whole body of the sand is at once abandoned.”\r\n\r\n\r\n              -------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n                            WONDERS OF ART.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  ------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n                         THE PYRAMIDS OF EGYPT.\r\n\r\nFrom the _natural_ wonders of the desert, let us next pass to some of\r\nthe _wonders of art_ which attract the attention of the traveler in\r\nlands that once were as flourishing and powerful, as now they are\r\ndegraded and depressed. Most of these monuments are, indeed, in ruins;\r\nbut many of them still stand in all their original grandeur, and all are\r\nenduring and faithful witnesses to the wealth and greatness of nations\r\nthat have now passed away forever.\r\n\r\nThe pyramids of Egypt are familiar, by name, to every intelligent\r\nreader, not to say to every child. The largest of these stupendous\r\nmonuments, equally famous for their enormous size and their remote\r\nantiquity, are those of Djiza, or (as now spelled) Gizeh, so called from\r\na village of that name, on the bank of the Nile, some three or four\r\nmiles above Cairo. The three which perhaps most attract the attention of\r\ntravelers, stand near each other, on the west side of the river, almost\r\nopposite Cairo, and not far from the site of the ancient Memphis. A view\r\nof them, and of the celebrated sphinx, which is spoken of hereafter, is\r\ngiven in the engraving on the next page. When seen from a distance,\r\npeering above the horizon, they display the fine distinct appearance so\r\noften remarked by travelers in the various objects seen through the\r\nclear, transparent atmosphere of the Egyptian climate. M. Savary, having\r\napproached to within three leagues of them, in the nighttime, while the\r\nfull moon shone bright upon them, describes them as appearing to him,\r\nunder this particular aspect, like two points of rock crowned by the\r\nclouds. On a nearer approach, their sloping and angular forms disguise\r\ntheir real hight, and lessen it to the eye; independently of which, as\r\nwhatever is regular is great or small by comparison, and as these masses\r\nof stone eclipse in magnitude every surrounding object, at the same time\r\nthat they are inferior to a mountain, to which alone the imagination can\r\nsuccessfully compare them, a degree of surprise is excited on finding\r\nthe first impression produced by a distant view so much diminished in\r\ndrawing near to them. On attempting, however, to measure any one of\r\nthese gigantic works of art by some known and determinate scale, it\r\nresumes its immensity to the mind; since, on drawing near to the\r\nopening, the persons who stand beneath it appear so small that they can\r\nscarcely be taken for men.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SPHINX AND PYRAMIDS.]\r\n\r\nThe base of the great pyramid of Cheops, so named after a king of Egypt,\r\nis estimated by Denon at seven hundred and twenty feet, and its hight at\r\nfour hundred and forty-eight feet, calculating the base by the mean\r\nproportion of the length of the stones, and the hight by the sum of that\r\nof each of the steps or stages. Its construction required so many years,\r\nand employed such a multitude of laborers, that the expenditure for\r\ngarlic and onions alone, for their consumption, is said to have amounted\r\nto one thousand and sixty talents, or more than twelve hundred thousand\r\ndollars. Its interior is thus accurately described by the above\r\ntraveler.\r\n\r\n“The entrance of the first gallery is concealed by the general outer\r\ncovering which invests the whole of the pyramid. It is, however,\r\nprobable, that the attention of the earlier searchers was by some\r\nparticular appearance directed to this spot. This gallery goes toward\r\nthe center of the edifice, in a direction sloping downward to the base:\r\nit is sixty paces in length; and at the further end are two large blocks\r\nof granite, an obstacle which caused some uncertainty in the digging. A\r\nhorizontal passage has been made for some distance into the mass of\r\nstone; but this undertaking was afterward abandoned.\r\n\r\n“Returning to the extremity of the first gallery, and working upward by\r\nthe side of the two granite blocks, you come to the beginning of the\r\nfirst sloping staircase, which proceeds in an oblique direction upward,\r\nfor a hundred and twenty feet. You mount the steep and narrow gallery,\r\nhelping your steps by notches cut in the ground, and by resting your\r\nhands against the sides. At the top of this gallery, which is formed of\r\na calcareous stone cemented with mortar, you find a landing-place about\r\nfifteen feet square, within which, to the right of the entrance, is a\r\nperpendicular opening called the well. This appears, from its\r\nirregularity, to have been the result of a fruitless attempt at a\r\nsearch, and has a diameter of about two feet by eighteen inches. There\r\nwere no means of descending it; but by throwing down a stone, it was\r\nascertained that its perpendicular direction could not be very\r\nconsiderable. On a level with the landing is a horizontal gallery, a\r\nhundred and seventy feet in length, running directly toward the center\r\nof the pyramid; and at the extremity of this gallery is a small room,\r\ncalled the queen’s chamber. This is an oblong square of eighteen feet\r\nand two inches, by fifteen feet and eight inches; but the hight is\r\nuncertain, the floor having been turned up by the avidity of the\r\nsearchers. One of the side walls has also been worked into, and the\r\nrubbish left on the spot. The roof, which is formed of a fine calcareous\r\nstone, very nearly brought together, has the form of an angle nearly\r\nequilateral, but contains neither ornament, hieroglyphic, nor the\r\nsmallest trace of a sarcophagus. Whether it was intended to contain a\r\nbody, is uncertain; but, in this case, the pyramid must have been built\r\nwith a view of containing two bodies, and would not therefore have been\r\nclosed at once. If the second tomb was really that of the queen, the two\r\nblocks of granite at the end of the first gallery, must have been\r\nfinally reserved to close all the interior chambers of the pyramid.\r\n\r\n“Returning again from the queen’s chamber to the landing-place, you\r\nascend a few feet, and immediately find yourself at the bottom of a\r\nlarge and magnificent staircase, or rather inclined plane, one hundred\r\nand eighty feet in length, taking a direction upward, and still bearing\r\ntoward the center of the edifice. It is six and a half feet in breadth,\r\nin which are to be included two parapets, each nineteen inches in\r\ndiameter, and pierced every three and a half feet, by oblong holes\r\ntwenty-two inches by three. The sarcophagus must have ascended this\r\npassage, and the series of holes must have been intended to receive a\r\nmachine of some description, to assist in raising so heavy a mass as the\r\nsarcophagus up so steep an ascent.\r\n\r\n“The side walls of this ascending gallery rise perpendicularly for\r\ntwelve feet, and then form a sloping roof of an excessively high pitch,\r\nnot by a regular angle, but by eight successive projections, each of\r\nthem six feet in hight, rising above the other, and approaching nearer\r\nto the corresponding projection on the opposite side, till the roof is\r\nentirely shut in. The hight of this singularly contrived vault may be\r\nestimated at sixty feet from the part of the floor immediately beneath.\r\nThe ascent of the staircase is facilitated by pretty regular but modern\r\nfootings cut in the floor; and at the top is a small platform, in which\r\nis a thick block of granite, resembling an immense chest, imbedded in\r\nthe solid building, and hollowed out so as to leave alternate\r\nprojections and retirings, into which are let blocks of the same\r\nmaterial, with corresponding grooves and projections, intended forever\r\nto conceal and protect the entrance to the principal chamber which is\r\nbehind them. It must have required immense labor to construct this part\r\nof the edifice, and not less to have broken an opening through; so that\r\nthe zeal of superstition has here been opposed to the eagerness of\r\navarice, and the latter has prevailed. After mining through thirteen\r\nfeet of solid granite, a door three feet and three inches square, has\r\nbeen discovered, which is the entrance to the principal chamber. This is\r\na long square, sixteen feet by thirty-two, and eighteen in hight. The\r\ndoor is in the angle facing the gallery, corresponding to the door of\r\nthe queen’s chamber, below. When it is said that the tomb is a single\r\npiece of granite, half-polished, and without cement, all that is\r\nremarkable in this strange monument, which exhibits such rigid\r\nsimplicity in the midst of the utmost magnificence of human power, will\r\nhave been described. The only broken part is an attempt at a search at\r\none of the angles, and two small holes nearly round and breast high.\r\nSuch is the interior of this immense edifice, in which the work of the\r\nhand of man appears to rival the gigantic forms of nature.”\r\n\r\nTo the above account by the accurate Denon, we subjoin the following\r\npleasing one by the celebrated Dr. Clarke. The impression made by these\r\nmonuments, when viewed at a distance, can never, he observes, be\r\nobliterated from his mind.\r\n\r\n“By reflecting the sun’s rays, they appeared as white as snow, and of\r\nsuch surprising magnitude, that nothing we had previously conceived in\r\nour imagination had prepared us for the spectacle we beheld. The sight\r\ninstantly convinced us that no power of description, no delineation, can\r\nconvey ideas adequate to the effect produced in viewing these stupendous\r\nmonuments. The formality of their structure is lost in their prodigious\r\nmagnitude: the mind, elevated by wonder, feels at once the force of an\r\naxiom, which, however disputed, experience confirms—that in vastness,\r\nwhatsoever be its nature, there dwells sublimity!\r\n\r\n“Having arrived at the bottom of a sandy slope, leading up to the\r\nprincipal pyramid, a band of Bedouin Arabs, who had assembled to receive\r\nus upon our landing, were much amused by the eagerness excited in our\r\nwhole party, to prove who should first set his foot upon the summit of\r\nthis artificial mountain. As we drew near its base, the effect of its\r\nprodigious magnitude, and the amazement caused in viewing the enormous\r\nmasses used in its construction, affected every one of us; but it was an\r\nimpression of awe and fear rather than of pleasure. In the observations\r\nof travelers who had recently preceded us, we had heard the pyramids\r\ndescribed as huge objects which gave no satisfaction to the spectator,\r\non account of their barbarous shape, and formal appearance: yet to us it\r\nappeared hardly possible that persons susceptible of any feeling of\r\nsublimity could behold them unmoved. With what amazement did we survey\r\nthe vast surface that was presented to us, when we arrived at this\r\nstupendous monument, which seemed to reach the clouds? Here and there\r\nappeared some Arab guides upon the immense masses above us, like so many\r\npigmies, waiting to show the way up to the summit. Now and then we\r\nthought we heard voices, and listened; but it was the wind in powerful\r\ngusts, sweeping the immense ranges of stone. Already some of our party\r\nhad begun the ascent, and were pausing at the tremendous depth which\r\nthey saw below. One of our military companions, after having surmounted\r\nthe most difficult part of the undertaking, became giddy in consequence\r\nof looking down from the elevation he had attained; and being compelled\r\nto abandon the project, he hired an Arab to assist him in effecting his\r\ndescent. The rest of us, more accustomed to the business of climbing\r\nhights, with many a halt for respiration, and many an exclamation of\r\nwonder, pursued our way toward the summit. The mode of ascent has been\r\nfrequently described; and yet, from the questions which are often\r\nproposed to travelers, it does not appear to be generally understood.\r\nThe reader may imagine himself to be upon a staircase, every step of\r\nwhich, to a man of middle stature, is nearly breast high; and the\r\nbreadth of each step is equal to its hight; consequently, the footing is\r\nsecure; and although a retrospect, in going up, be sometimes fearful to\r\npersons unaccustomed to look down from any considerable elevation, yet\r\nthere is little danger of falling. In some places, indeed, where the\r\nstones are decayed, caution may be required; and an Arab guide is always\r\nnecessary, to avoid a total interruption; but, upon the whole, the means\r\nof ascent are such that almost every one may accomplish it. Our progress\r\nwas impeded by other causes. We carried with us a few instruments; such\r\nas our boat-compass, a thermometer, a telescope, &c.: these could not be\r\ntrusted in the hands of Arabs, and they were liable to be broken every\r\ninstant. At length we reached the topmost tier, to the great delight and\r\nsatisfaction of all the party. Here we found a platform, thirty-two feet\r\nsquare, consisting of nine large stones, each of which might weigh about\r\na tun; although they are much inferior in size to some of the stones\r\nused in the construction of this pyramid.\r\n\r\n“The view from the summit of the pyramid amply fulfilled our\r\nexpectations; nor do the accounts which have been given of it, as it\r\nappears at this season of the year, (in the month of August,) exaggerate\r\nthe novelty and grandeur of the sight. All the region toward Cairo and\r\nthe delta resembled a sea covered with innumerable islands. Forests of\r\npalm-trees were seen standing in the water; the inundation spreading\r\nover the land where they stood, so as to give them an appearance of\r\ngrowing in the flood. To the north, as far as the eye could reach,\r\nnothing could be discerned, but a watery surface thus diversified by\r\nplantations and by villages. To the south we saw the pyramids of\r\nSakkara; and, upon the east of these, smaller monuments of the same\r\nkind, nearer to the Nile. An appearance of ruins might indeed be traced\r\nthe whole way from the pyramids of Gizeh to those of Sakkara; as if they\r\nhad been once connected, so as to constitute one vast cemetery. Beyond\r\nthe pyramids of Sakkara we could perceive the distant mountains of the\r\nSaid; and upon an eminence near the Libyan side of the Nile appeared a\r\nmonastery of considerable size. Toward the west and south-west, the eye\r\nranged over the great Libyan desert, extending to the utmost verge of\r\nthe horizon, without a single object to interrupt the dreary horror of\r\nthe landscape, except dark floating spots, caused by the shadows of\r\npassing clouds upon the sand.\r\n\r\n“The stones of the platform upon the top, as well as most of the others\r\nused in constructing the decreasing ranges from the base upward, are of\r\nsoft limestone. Those employed in the construction of the pyramids, are\r\nof the same nature as the calcareous rock on which they stand, and which\r\nwas apparently cut away to form them. Herodotus says, however, that they\r\nwere brought from the Arabian side of the Nile.\r\n\r\n“The French attempted to open the smallest of the three principal\r\npyramids; and having effected a very considerable chasm in one of its\r\nsides, have left this mark behind them, as an everlasting testimony of\r\ntheir curiosity and zeal. The landing of our army in Egypt put a stop to\r\ntheir labor. Had it not been for this circumstance, the interior of that\r\nmysterious monument would probably be now submitted to the inquiry which\r\nhas long been an object among literary men.\r\n\r\n“Having collected our party upon a soft platform before the entrance of\r\nthe passage leading to the interior, and lighted a number of tapers, we\r\nall descended into the dark mouth of the larger pyramid. The impression\r\nmade upon every one of us, in viewing the entrance, was this: that no\r\nset of men whatever could thus have opened a passage, by uncovering\r\nprecisely the part of the pyramid where the entrance was concealed,\r\nunless they had been previously acquainted with its situation; and for\r\nthese reasons. First, because its position is almost in the center of\r\none of its planes, instead of being at the base. Secondly, that not a\r\ntrace appears of those dilapidations which must have been the result of\r\nany search for a passage to the interior; such as now distinguish the\r\nlabors of the French upon the smaller pyramid, which they attempted to\r\nopen. The persons who undertook the work, actually opened the pyramid in\r\nthe only point, over all its vast surface, where, from the appearance of\r\nthe stones inclined to each other above the mouth of the passage, any\r\nadmission to the interior seems to have been originally intended. So\r\nmarvelously concealed as this was, are we to credit the legendary story\r\nof an Arabian writer, who, discoursing of the wonders of Egypt,\r\nattributed the opening of this pyramid to Almamon, a caliph of Babylon,\r\nabout nine hundred and fifty years since?\r\n\r\n“Proceeding down this passage, which may be compared to a chimney about\r\na yard wide, we presently arrived at a very large mass of granite: this\r\nseems to have been placed on purpose to choke up the passage; but a way\r\nhas been made round it, by which we were enabled to ascend into a second\r\nchannel, sloping, in a contrary direction, toward the mouth of the\r\nfirst. Having ascended along this channel, to the distance of one\r\nhundred and ten feet, we came to a horizontal passage, leading to a\r\nchamber with an angular roof, in the interior of the pyramid. In this\r\npassage we found, upon our right hand, the mysterious well, which has\r\nbeen so often mentioned. Pliny makes the depth of it equal to one\r\nhundred and twenty-nine feet; but Greaves, in sounding it with a line,\r\nfound the plummet rest at the depth of twenty feet.\r\n\r\n“We threw down some stones, and observed that they rested at about the\r\ndepth which Greaves has mentioned; but being at length provided with a\r\nstone nearly as large as the mouth of the well, and about fifty pounds\r\nin weight, we let this fall, listening attentively to the result from\r\nthe spot where the other stones rested: we were agreeably surprised by\r\nhearing, after a length of time which must have equaled some seconds, a\r\nloud and distinct report, seeming to come from a spacious subterraneous\r\napartment, accompanied by a splashing noise, as if the stone had been\r\nbroken in pieces, and had fallen into a reservoir of water at an amazing\r\ndepth. Thus does experience always tend to confirm the accounts left us\r\nby the ancients; for this exactly answers to the description given by\r\nPliny of this well.\r\n\r\n“After once more regaining the passage whence these ducts diverge, we\r\nexamined the chamber at the end of it, mentioned by all who have\r\ndescribed the interior of this building. Its roof is angular; that is to\r\nsay, it is formed by the inclination of large masses of stone leaning\r\ntoward each other, like the appearance presented by those masses which\r\nare above the entrance to the pyramid. Then quitting the passage\r\naltogether, we climbed the slippery and difficult ascent which leads to\r\nwhat is called the principal chamber. The workmanship, from its\r\nperfection, and its immense proportions, is truly astonishing. All about\r\nthe spectator, as he proceeds, is full of majesty, and mystery, and\r\nwonder. Presently we entered that ‘glorious roome,’ as it is justly\r\ncalled by Greaves, where, ‘as within some consecrated oratory, art may\r\nseem to have contended with nature.’ It stands ‘in the very heart and\r\ncenter of the pyramid, equidistant from all its sides, and almost in the\r\nmidst between the basis and the top. The floor, the sides, the roof of\r\nit, are all made of vast and exquisite tables of Thebaick marble.’ So\r\nnicely are these masses fitted to each other upon the sides of the\r\nchamber, that, having no cement between them, it is really impossible to\r\nforce the blade of a knife within the joints. This has been often\r\nrelated before; but we actually tried the experiment, and found it to be\r\ntrue. There are only six ranges of stone from the floor to the roof,\r\nwhich is twenty feet high; and the length of the chamber is about twelve\r\nyards. It is also about six yards wide. The roof or ceiling consists of\r\nonly nine pieces, of stupendous size and length, traversing the room\r\nfrom side to side, and lying, like enormous beams, across the top.”\r\n\r\nMr. Salt, the traveler, having paid a later visit to the principal\r\npyramid, in company with a British officer, ascertained that the short\r\ndescending passage at its entrance, which afterward ascends to the two\r\nchambers, is continued in a straight line through the base of the\r\npyramid into the rock on which it stands. This new passage, a view of\r\nwhich is given in the cut below, after joining what was formerly called\r\nthe well, is continued forward in a horizontal line, and terminates in a\r\nwell, ten feet in depth, exactly beneath the apex of the pyramid, and at\r\nthe depth of one hundred feet beneath its base. Mr. Salt’s companion\r\nlikewise discovered an apartment immediately above the king’s chamber,\r\nexactly of the same size, and of the same fine workmanship, but only\r\nfour feet in hight.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ENTRANCE TO ONE OF THE PYRAMIDS OF GIZEH.]\r\n\r\nThe base of the pyramid of Cephrenes, the next in magnitude, of the\r\npyramids of Gizeh, to that of Cheops, is estimated at six hundred and\r\nfifty-five feet, and its hight at three hundred and ninety-eight. The\r\npyramid of Mycerinus has a base of two hundred and eighty feet, and an\r\nelevation of one hundred and sixty-two. But, as well suggested by\r\nThompson, in his “Egypt Past and Present,” no mere detail of figures and\r\nstatistics, can convey an idea of the size of these vast bodies as they\r\nimpress us when we stand before them. “No idea,” he says, “can be given\r\nof the great pyramid, by the statement that it covers an area of nearly\r\nfive hundred and fifty thousand square feet, measures seven hundred and\r\nfifty feet upon each of its four sides at the base, and is four hundred\r\nand sixty feet in hight, or that it would fill the whole length of\r\nWashington square in New York, and exceed its breadth by half, and would\r\nrise nearly two hundred feet higher than the spire of Trinity church.\r\nThe mass of masonry is what impresses you. Eighty-five million cubic\r\nfeet of solid masonry, gives you no very definite idea of the mass of\r\nstone here piled together with such mathematical precision that\r\nastronomical calculations could be based upon its angles and shadows.\r\nNo, you must see the mass itself, not now smooth and polished, as when\r\noriginally completed, but stripped of its outer casing, and showing tier\r\non tier of huge stones squared and fitted at mathematical angles, and\r\nnow forming a series of rude steps, each from two to four feet high,\r\nextending to the very top. That top is now a platform about thirty feet\r\nsquare; and the view from its elevation is unparalleled in the world!\r\nBefore you is Cairo, with its lofty minarets, and its overhanging\r\ncitadel, the mountains of Mokuttam skirting its rear; the green valley\r\nof the Nile is spread out for miles northward and southward; at your\r\nfeet are the mounds of sand that cover the ancient Memphis; southward is\r\nthe whole range of pyramids to Sakkara; behind you are fragments of\r\nother pyramids, the Libyan mountains, and the wide waste of the great\r\ndesert. But the present is lost in the associations of the past. You are\r\nstanding upon a monument that is known to have stood within a score of\r\nfour thousand years; that was as old as are our associations of Plymouth\r\nrock, when Abraham came into Egypt, and journeyed to Memphis to enjoy\r\nthe favor of the king. He looked with wondering eyes upon this self-same\r\nmonument, and heard the _then_ dim tradition of the tyrant, who, having\r\nbuilt it for his own sepulcher by the sweat and blood of half a million\r\nof his subjects, was compelled to beg of his friends to bury him\r\nprivately in some secret place, lest after his death, his body should be\r\ndragged by the people from the hated tomb!”\r\n\r\nThe pyramids of Sakkara, which are numerous, are interesting on account\r\nof the peculiarities of their structure. The largest of them is of an\r\nirregular form, the line of the terminating angle being sloped like a\r\nbuttress reversed. Another, of a middling size, is composed of stages\r\nrising one above another. The smaller ones are greatly decayed; but the\r\nwhole occupy an extent of two leagues. This multitude of pyramids\r\nscattered over the district of Sakkara, Denon observes, prove that this\r\nterritory was the necropolis (city of the dead) to the south of Memphis,\r\nand that the village opposite to this, in which the pyramids of Gizeh\r\nare situated, was another necropolis, which formed the northern\r\nextremity of Memphis. The extent of that ancient city may thus be\r\nmeasured.\r\n\r\nTo these interesting accounts of this group of the pyramids, may be\r\nsubjoined the graphic sketch of Bayard Taylor, who visited them so\r\nrecently as 1851. “When we threw open the latticed blinds of our cabin,\r\nbefore sunrise the next morning, the extraordinary purity of the air\r\ngave rise to an amusing optical delusion on the part of my friend. ‘See\r\nthat wall!’ said he, pointing to a space between two white houses; ‘what\r\na brilliant color it is painted, and how those palms and these white\r\nhouses are relieved against it!’ He was obliged to look twice before he\r\nperceived that what he had taken for a wall close at hand, was really\r\nthe sky, and rested upon a far-off horizon. Our donkeys were in\r\nreadiness on the bank, and taking Achmet with us, we rode off gayly\r\namong the mud hovels and under the date-trees of Gizeh, on our way to\r\nthe pyramids. The rising sun shone redly upon them, as we rode out on\r\nthe broad harvest land of the Nile. The black unctuous loam was still\r\ntoo moist from the inundation to be plowed, except in spots, here and\r\nthere, but even where the water had scarce evaporated, millions of germs\r\nwere pushing their slender blades up to the sunshine. In that prolific\r\nsoil, the growth of grain is visible from day to day. The Fellahs were\r\nat work on all sides, preparing for planting, and the ungainly buffaloes\r\ndrew their long plows slowly through the soil. Where freshly turned, the\r\nearth had a rich, soft luster, like dark-brown velvet, beside which the\r\nfields of young wheat, beans and lentils, glittered with the most\r\nbrilliant green. The larks sang in the air and flocks of white pigeons\r\nclustered like blossoms on the tops of the sycamores. There, in\r\nNovember, it was the freshest and most animating picture of spring. The\r\ndirect road to the pyramids was impassable, on account of the water, and\r\nwe rode along the top of a dike, intersected by canals, to the edge of\r\nthe Libyan desert, a distance of nearly ten miles. The ruptures in the\r\ndike obliged us occasionally to dismount, and at the last canal, which\r\ncuts off the advancing sands from the bounteous plain on the other side,\r\nour donkeys were made to swim, while we were carried across on the\r\nshoulders of two naked Arabs. They had run out in advance to meet us,\r\nhailing us with many English and French phrases, while half a dozen\r\nboys, with earthen bottles which they had just filled from the slimy\r\ncanal, crowded after them, insisting, in very good English, that we\r\nshould drink at once and take them with us to the pyramids.\r\n\r\n“Our donkeys’ hoofs now sank deep in the Libyan sands, and we looked up\r\nto the great stone-piles of Cheops, Cephrenes and Mycerinus, not more\r\nthan half a mile distant. Our sunrise view of the pyramids on leaving\r\nGizeh, was sufficient, had I gone no further; and I approached them,\r\nwithout the violent emotion which sentimental travelers experience, but\r\nwith a quiet feeling of the most perfect satisfaction. The form of the\r\npyramid is so simple and complete, that nothing is left to the\r\nimagination. Those vast, yellowish-gray masses, whose feet are wrapped\r\nin the silent sand, and whose tops lean against the serene blue heaven,\r\nenter the mind and remain in the memory with no shock of surprise, no\r\nstir of unexpected admiration. The impression they give and leave, is\r\ncalm, grand and enduring as themselves.\r\n\r\n“The sun glared hot on the sand as we toiled up the ascent to the base\r\nof Cheops, whose sharp corners were now broken into zigzags by the\r\nlayers of stone. As we dismounted in his shadow, at the foot of the path\r\nwhich leads up to the entrance, on the northern side, a dozen Arabs\r\nbeset us. They belonged to the regular herd who have the pyramids in\r\ncharge, and are so renowned for their impudence that it is customary to\r\nemploy the janissary of some consulate in Cairo, as a protection. I took\r\nthree of them and commenced the ascent, leaving Achmet and my friend\r\nbelow. Two boys followed us, with bottles of water. At first, the way\r\nseemed hazardous, for the stones were covered with sand and fragments\r\nwhich had fallen from above, but after we had mounted twenty courses,\r\nthe hard, smooth blocks of granite formed broader and more secure steps.\r\nTwo Arabs went before, one holding each of my hands, while the third\r\nshoved me up from the rear. The assistance thus rendered was not slight,\r\nfor few of the stones are less than four feet in hight. The water-boys\r\nscampered up beside us with the agility of cats. We stopped a moment to\r\ntake breath, at a sort of resting-place half-way up, an opening in the\r\npyramid, communicating with the uppermost of the interior chambers. I\r\nhad no sooner sat down on the nearest stone, than the Arabs stretched\r\nthemselves at my feet and entertained me with most absurd mixture of\r\nflattery and menace. One, patting the calves of my legs, cried out, ‘Oh,\r\nwhat fine, strong legs! how fast they came up: nobody ever went up the\r\npyramid so fast!’ while the others added, ‘Here you must give us\r\nbacksheesh: everybody gives us a dollar here.’ My only answer was, to\r\nget up and begin climbing, and they did not cease pulling and pushing\r\ntill they left me breathless on the summit. The whole ascent did not\r\noccupy more than ten minutes.\r\n\r\n“The view from Cheops has been often described. I can not say that it\r\nincreased my impression of the majesty and grandeur of the pyramid, for\r\nthat was already complete. My eyes wandered off from the courses of\r\ngranite, broadening away below my feet, to contemplate the glorious\r\ngreen of the Nile-plain, barred with palm-trees and divided by the\r\ngleaming flood of the ancient river; the minarets of Cairo; the purple\r\nwalls of the far Arabian mountains; the pyramid groups of Sakkara and\r\nDashoor, overlooking disinterred Memphis in the south; and the arid\r\nyellow waves of the Libyan desert, which rolled unbroken to the western\r\nsky. The clear, open heaven above, which seemed to radiate light from\r\nits entire concave, clasped in its embrace and harmonized the different\r\nfeatures of this wonderful landscape. There was too much warmth and\r\nbrilliance for desolation. Everything was alive and real; the pyramids\r\nwere not ruins, and the dead Pharaohs, the worshipers of Athor and Apis,\r\ndid not once enter my mind.\r\n\r\n“My wild attendants did not long allow me to enjoy the view quietly. To\r\nescape from their importunities for backsheesh I gave them two piasters\r\nin copper coin, which instantly turned their flatteries into the most\r\nbitter complaints. It was insulting to give so little, and they\r\npreferred having none; if I would not give a dollar, I might take the\r\nmoney back. I took it without more ado, and put it into my pocket. This\r\nrather surprised them, and first one, and then another, came to me and\r\nbegged to have it again, on his own private account. I threw the coins\r\nhigh into the air, and as they clattered down on the stones, there\r\nensued such a scramble as would have sent any but Arabs over the edge of\r\nthe pyramid. We then commenced the descent, two seizing my hands as\r\nbefore, and dragging me headlong after them. We went straight down the\r\nside, sliding and leaping from stone to stone without stopping to take\r\nbreath, and reached the base in five or six minutes. I was so excited\r\nfrom the previous aggression of the Arabs, that I neither felt fatigue\r\nnor giddiness on the way up and down, and was not aware how violent had\r\nbeen my exertions. But when I touched the level sand, all my strength\r\nvanished in an instant. A black mist came over my eyes, and I sank down\r\nhelpless and nearly insensible. I was scarcely able to speak, and it was\r\nan hour before I could sit upright on my donkey. I felt the pyramid in\r\nall my bones, and for two or three days afterward moved my joints with\r\nas much difficulty as a rheumatic patient.\r\n\r\n“In returning, in about an hour and a half we reached the ruined\r\npyramids of Abousir, where our path turned southward into the desert.\r\nAfter seeing Cheops and Cephrenes, these pyramids are only interesting\r\non account of their dilapidated state and the peculiarity of their\r\nforms, some of their sides taking a more obtuse angle at half their\r\nhight. They are buried deep in the sand, which has so drifted toward the\r\nplain, that from the broad hollow lying between them and the group of\r\nSakkara, more than a mile distant, every sign of vegetation is shut out.\r\nVast, sloping causeways of masonry lead up to two of them, and a large\r\nmound, occupying the space between, suggests the idea that a temple\r\nformerly stood there. The whole of the desert promontory, which seemed\r\nto have been gradually blown out on the plain, from the hills in the\r\nrear, exhibits traces here and there of ruins beneath the surface. My\r\nfriend and I, as we walked over the hot sand, before our panting\r\ndonkeys, came instinctively to the same conclusion, that a large city\r\nmust have once occupied the space between, and to the southward of the\r\ntwo groups of pyramids. It is not often that amateur antiquarians find\r\nsuch sudden and triumphant confirmation of their conjectures, as we did.\r\n\r\n“On the way, Achmet had told us of a Frenchman who had been all summer\r\ndigging in the sand, near Sakkara. After we had crawled into the\r\nsubterranean dépôt of mummied ibises, and nearly choked ourselves with\r\ndust in trying to find a pot not broken open; and after one of our\r\ndonkeymen went into a human mummy pit and brought out the feet and legs\r\nof some withered old Egyptian, we saw before us the residence of this\r\nFrenchman; a mud hut on a high sand-bank. It was an unfortunate\r\nbuilding, for nearly all the front wall had tumbled down, revealing the\r\ncontents of his kitchen. One or two Arabs loitered about, but a large\r\nnumber were employed at the end of a long trench which extended to the\r\nhills. Before reaching the house a number of deep pits barred our path,\r\nand the loose sand, stirred by our feet, slid back into the bottom, as\r\nif eager to hide the wonders they disclosed. Pavements, fresh as when\r\nfirst laid; basement-walls of white marble, steps, doorways, pedestals\r\nand fragments of pillars glittered in the sun, which, after the lapse of\r\nmore than two thousand years, beheld them again. I slid down the side of\r\nthe pit and walked in the streets of Memphis. The pavement of bitumen,\r\nwhich once covered the stone blocks, apparently to protect them and\r\ndeaden the noise of horses and chariots, was entire in many places. Here\r\na marble sphinx sat at the base of a temple, and stared abstractedly\r\nbefore her; there a sculptured cornice, with heavy moldings, leaned\r\nagainst the walls of the chamber into which it had fallen; and over all\r\nwere scattered fragments of glazed and painted tiles and sculptured\r\nalabaster. The principal street was narrow, and was apparently occupied\r\nby private dwellings, but at its extremity were the basement-walls of a\r\nspacious edifice. All the pits opened on pavements and walls, so fresh\r\nand cleanly cut, that they seemed rather the foundations of a new city,\r\nlaid yesterday, than the remains of one of the oldest capitals of the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n“We approached the workmen, where we met the discoverer of Memphis, Mr.\r\nAuguste Mariette. On finding we were not Englishmen, (of whose visits he\r\nappeared to be rather shy,) he became very courteous and communicative.\r\nHe apologized for the little he had to show us, since on account of the\r\nvandalism of the Arabs, he was obliged to cover up all his discoveries,\r\nafter making his drawings and measurements. The Egyptian authorities are\r\nworse than apathetic, for they would not hesitate to burn the sphinxes\r\nfor lime, and build barracks for filthy soldiers with the marble blocks.\r\nBesides this, the French influence at Cairo was then entirely\r\novershadowed by that of England, and although M. Mariette was supported\r\nin his labors by the French academy, and a subscription headed by Louis\r\nNapoleon’s name, he was forced to be content with the simple permission\r\nto dig out these remarkable ruins and describe them. He could neither\r\nprotect them nor remove the portable sculptures and inscriptions, and\r\ntherefore preferred giving them again into the safe keeping of the sand.\r\nHere they will be secure from injury, until some more fortunate period,\r\nwhen, possibly, the lost Memphis may be entirely given to the world, as\r\nfresh as Pompeii, and far more grand and imposing.\r\n\r\n“I asked M. Mariette what first induced him to dig for Memphis in that\r\nspot, since antiquarians had fixed upon the mounds near Mitrahenny (a\r\nvillage in the plain below, and about four miles distant,) as the former\r\nsite of the city. He said that the tenor of an inscription which he\r\nfound on one of the blocks quarried out of these mounds, induced him to\r\nbelieve that the principal part of the city lay to the westward, and\r\ntherefore he commenced excavating in the nearest sand-hill in that\r\ndirection. After sinking pits in various places he struck on an avenue\r\nof sphinxes, the clue to all his after discoveries. Following this, he\r\ncame upon the remains of a temple, (probably the _Serapeum_, or temple\r\nof Serapis, mentioned by Strabo,) and afterward upon streets,\r\ncolonnades, public and private edifices, and all other signs of a great\r\ncity. The number of sphinxes alone, buried under these high sand-drifts,\r\namounted to two thousand, and he had frequently uncovered twenty or\r\nthirty in a day. He estimated the entire number of statues, inscriptions\r\nand reliefs, at between four and five thousand. The most remarkable\r\ndiscovery was that of eight colossal statues, which were evidently the\r\nproduct of Grecian art. During thirteen months of assiduous labor, with\r\nbut one assistant, he had made drawings of all these objects and\r\nforwarded them to Paris. In order to be near at hand, he had built an\r\nArab house of unburnt bricks, the walls of which had just tumbled down\r\nfor the third time. His workmen were then engaged in clearing away the\r\nsand from the dwelling of some old Memphian, and he intended spreading\r\nhis roof over the massive walls, and making his residence in the exhumed\r\ncity. The man’s appearance showed what he had undergone, and gave me an\r\nidea of the extraordinary zeal and patience required to make a\r\nsuccessful antiquarian. His face was as brown as an Arab’s, his eyes\r\nseverely inflamed, and his hands as rough as a bricklayer’s. His manner\r\nwith the native workmen was admirable, and they labored with a hearty\r\ngood-will which almost supplied the want of the needful implements. All\r\nthey had were straw baskets, which they filled with a sort of rude\r\nshovel, and then handed up to be carried off on the heads of others.\r\n\r\n“Strabo states that Memphis had a circumference of seventeen miles, and\r\ntherefore both M. Mariette and the antiquarians are right. The mounds of\r\nMitrahenny probably mark the eastern portion of the city, while its\r\nwestern limit extended beyond the pyramids of Sakkara, and included in\r\nits suburbs those of Abousir and Dashoor. The space explored by M.\r\nMariette is about a mile and a half in length, and somewhat more than\r\nhalf a mile in breadth. He was then continuing his excavations westward,\r\nand had almost reached the first ridge of the Libyan hills, without\r\nfinding the termination of the ruins. The magnitude of his discovery\r\nwill be best known when his drawings and descriptions are given to the\r\nworld. A few months after my visit, his labors were further rewarded by\r\nfinding thirteen colossal sarcophagi of black marble, and he has\r\nrecently added to his renown by discovering an entrance to the Sphinx.\r\nYet at that time, the exhumation of the lost Memphis, second only in\r\nimportance to that of Nineveh, was unknown in Europe, except to a few\r\n_sarans_ in Paris, and the first intimation which some of my friends in\r\nCairo and Alexandria had of it, was my own account of my visit, in the\r\nnewspapers they received from America. But M. Mariette is a young man,\r\nand will yet see his name inscribed beside those of Burckhardt, Belzoni\r\nand Layard.\r\n\r\n“We had still a long ride before us, and I took leave of Memphis and its\r\ndiscoverer, promising to revisit him on my return from Khartoum. As we\r\npassed the brick pyramid of Sakkara, which is built in four terraces of\r\nequal hight, the dark, grateful green of the palms and harvest-fields of\r\nthe Nile appeared between two sand-hills, a genuine balm to our heated\r\neyes. We rode through groves of the fragrant mimosa to a broad dike, the\r\nwindings of which we were obliged to follow across the plain, as the\r\nsoil was still wet and adhesive. It was too late to visit the beautiful\r\npyramids of Dashoor, the first of which is more than three hundred feet\r\nin hight, and from a distance has almost as grand an effect as those of\r\nGizeh. Our tired donkeys lagged slowly along to the palm-groves of\r\nMitrahenny, where we saw mounds of earth, a few blocks of red granite\r\nand a colossal statue of Remeses II., (Sesostris,) which until now were\r\nsupposed to be the only remains of Memphis. The statue lies on its face\r\nin a hole filled with water. The countenance is said to be very\r\nbeautiful, but I could only see the top of Sesostris’s back, which bore\r\na faint resemblance to a crocodile. Through fields of cotton in pod and\r\nbeans in blossom, we rode to the Nile, dismissed our donkeys and their\r\nattendants, and lay down on some bundles of cornstalks to wait the\r\narrival of our boat. But there had been a south wind all day, and we had\r\nridden much faster than our men could tow. We sat till long after sunset\r\nbefore the stars and stripes, floating from the mizzen of the Cleopatra,\r\nturned the corner below Bedrasheyn. When, at last, we sat at our\r\ncabin-table, weary and hungry, we were ready to confess that the works\r\nof art produced by our cook, were more marvelous and interesting than\r\nMemphis and the pyramids.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                         THE TOMBS AT SAKKARA.\r\n\r\nThe prediction of Taylor, quoted above, “that M. Mariette, though a\r\nyoung man, would yet see his name inscribed beside those of Burckhardt,\r\nBelzoni and Layard,” is in a fair way for fulfillment; for the finding\r\nof the wonderful tombs of Sakkara, and their magnificent sarcophagi, is,\r\nperhaps, the greatest discovery which has been made relative to the\r\nantiquities of Egypt, since the days of Belzoni himself. The tomb, a\r\nview of the entrance to which is given in the cut below, is situated in\r\nthe desert near Sakkara, to the north-west of and near the pyramid,\r\nabout four or five hours’ ride from Cairo, by way of Toura, where the\r\nNile must be crossed. Monsieur Mariette, to whose knowledge and research\r\nthis discovery is due, is employed by the French government. A passage\r\nin Strabo having led him to infer that a line of sphinxes led to the\r\nSerapeum, he commenced his search, under a firman from the viceroy of\r\nEgypt, about two years and a half since, in the moving sand-hills of\r\nSakkara. He discovered the line of sphinxes, one of which had been found\r\nin 1832, by Signor Marucchi; but they not being in a straight direction,\r\nand turning abruptly at the entrance of the Serapeum, it was with\r\ndifficulty they were traced. They were one hundred and forty in number,\r\nand sixteen feet apart. The whole avenue proved eleven hundred and\r\ntwenty feet in length. At the termination were eleven Greek statues of\r\nHomer, Pindar, Solon, Lycurgus, Aristotle, and other poets,\r\nphilosophers, and lawgivers of Greece. One sphinx, having the name of\r\nApis inscribed upon it, was met with under a depth of sixty or seventy\r\nfeet of sand: stone peacocks nine feet high, and colossal lions, were\r\nalso found here. The tomb of Apis was now sought for, and discovered,\r\nafter a whole year of labor, on the twelfth of November, 1851. From the\r\navenue a mastaba, or bench, and passage two hundred and ninety feet\r\nlong, leads to a pylon, the entrance of the great temple. The tomb runs\r\nfrom south to north, and the great gallery from east to west. This is\r\nabout five hundred and twenty yards in length, and from four to five\r\nyards wide. The chambers are not formed throughout the whole length of\r\nthe gallery, and some passages are altogether without them. The\r\nhieroglyphic inscriptions on the tomb are, in one instance, if not more,\r\nunfinished; and the doors erected at the entrance are too small to have\r\nallowed the passage of the sarcophagi, and must, therefore, have been\r\nbuilt after the latter were introduced. The chambers are not opposite\r\neach other, but arranged alternately, in the usual manner of Egyptian\r\nplaces of sepulture. The appearance of this long gallery, when lighted\r\nup by numerous candles, receding in dim perspective into gloom—the\r\nmassive sarcophagi, of polished granite, each in its chamber, looking\r\ntranquillity, is an imposing sight, as may be seen in the next following\r\ncut. They are of enormous size and weight: one, and that not the\r\nlargest, has been estimated to weigh, including the lid, upward of sixty\r\ntuns. To have moved these and lowered them into their receptacles, which\r\nare some six feet below the floor of the gallery, in so confined a\r\nspace, must have required a considerable amount of mechanical skill and\r\npower. In the walls are holes, apparently for the introduction of the\r\nends of beams. The chambers may, however, have been filled with sand,\r\nthe sarcophagus pushed in and gradually lowered by abstracting the sand.\r\nThe under side of one of the sarcophagi is rounded, and it was kept\r\nsteady by wooden blocks on each side. When these are removed it can be\r\nrocked by the hand. A groove, about two feet broad and two or three\r\ninches in depth, runs down the middle of the gallery. A wooden capstan\r\nwas found near the tombs, and is supposed to have been used for moving\r\nthe stones. The entrance is inclined. The tombs are excavated in a soft\r\nfriable limestone, containing numerous small veins of gypsum, about half\r\nan inch in thickness. To prevent the roof from falling, it has been\r\ncoated with flagstones, cemented to it by a gypseous cement; but, either\r\nby the hand of violence, or that of time, these have been detached, and\r\nhave fallen to the ground, encumbering, and partially choking the\r\ngalleries and rooms. The mortar, however, still adheres in several\r\nplaces to the walls, and projects where the joints of the stones have\r\nbeen. In one chamber is a self-sustained stone arch; another proof, if\r\nany were now necessary, that its construction was known to the ancients.\r\nThis chamber contains a small sarcophagus, in which, probably, were the\r\nbones of a young bull. The bones of bulls have been found in several\r\nsarcophagi; but every one had been opened, and some heaped with stones;\r\nan eastern mark of contempt, probably the work of the Persians. At the\r\nentrance were numerous _ex voto_ offerings of inscribed tablets inserted\r\nin small recesses in the walls. There are also inscriptions, in the\r\nDemotic character, on the outer doorway. In some chambers are large\r\nrecesses to the right and left of the tomb, which in one instance\r\ncontained a large granite tablet with hieroglyphics. The number of\r\nsarcophagi already discovered is twenty-five.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ENTRANCE TO THE TOMBS OF SAKKARA.]\r\n\r\nThese tombs merit the visit of all antiquaries and travelers passing\r\nthrough Egypt; and M. Mariette’s work describing them is looked for with\r\nanxiety by all _savans_. To his kindness and courtesy, which, as well as\r\nhis hospitality, are well known, the public are indebted for the greater\r\nportion of this information. Near to Sakkara, on the site of Memphis,\r\nHekekyan Bey has been making excavations connected with the geological\r\ninvestigations of the Nile valley, instituted at the request of Mr.\r\nLeonard Horner and the Geological Society of London, by the viceroy, who\r\nhas very recently received from the English government, through Mr.\r\nMurray, a letter of thanks for his liberal aid to the cause of science.\r\n\r\nA view of the great gallery of these tombs, as it appears when lighted\r\nup, is given on the next page.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              THE SPHINX.\r\n\r\nBefore passing to the pyramids and ruins of Meroë in Ethiopia, let us\r\nnotice the celebrated Sphinx, which stands near the great pyramids of\r\nGizeh, and the enormous bulk of which attracts the attention of every\r\ntraveler. Of all the monuments of Egypt, this, in many respects, is the\r\nmost mysterious and impressive. It is cut out of the solid rock, and by\r\nsome is supposed to have been the sepulcher of Amasis. It is more than\r\nsixty feet from the ground to the crown of the head; more than a hundred\r\nfeet around the forehead; and nearly one hundred and fifty feet in\r\nlength. The nose has been shamefully mutilated. “Though its proportions\r\nare colossal, its outline,” says Denon, “is pure and graceful; the\r\nexpression mild, gracious, and tranquil; the character is African; but\r\nthe mouth, the lips of which are thick, has a softness and delicacy of\r\nexecution truly admirable; it seems real life and flesh. Art must have\r\nbeen at a high pitch when this monument was executed; for, if the head\r\nis deficient in what is called _style_, that is, in the straight and\r\nbold lines which give expression to the figures under which the Greeks\r\nhave designated their deities, yet sufficient justice has been rendered\r\nto the fine simplicity and character of nature displayed in this\r\nfigure.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GREAT GALLERY OF THE TOMBS OF SAKKARA.]\r\n\r\nThus far the description of Denon. But Taylor, who says of this monument\r\nthat “there is nothing like it in the world,” adds, that “those\r\ntravelers who pronounce its features to be negro in their character, are\r\ncertainly very hasty in their conclusions. That it is an Egyptian head,\r\nis plainly evident, notwithstanding its mutilation. The type, however,\r\nis rather fuller and broader than is usual in Egyptian statues.” Who\r\nreared it, and for what purpose, and by what mighty enginery, is utterly\r\nunknown. But there it stands, “on the verge of the desert whose sands\r\nare heaped around it, and in advance of the three vast pyramids that\r\nform an immovable phalanx as if to guard it from destruction, looking\r\nout in unfathomable silence over the empty plain where once stood\r\nMemphis in the pride of the earlier Pharaohs, and where Cambyses\r\nbattered down that pride with the recklessness of a barbarian invader.\r\nOnce an altar stood before it, and a _dromos_ of crouching lions and\r\nother figures formed a fit approach to the gigantic symbol of Egypt\r\ndeified. But now the sands drift in perpetually to hide all but the\r\nhead, whose sublime repose neither the war-club of the Persian, nor tho\r\nfury of the sirocco has ever disturbed.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                      RUINS AND PYRAMIDS OF MEROË.\r\n\r\nPassing up the Nile to its great fork in about latitude seventeen\r\ndegrees, we come to the wonderful ruins and pyramids of Meroë, in\r\nEthiopia. “The discovery of these ruins,” says the well known traveler\r\nlast quoted, “is of comparatively recent date; and it is only within a\r\nvery short time that their true place and character in Ethiopian history\r\nhave been satisfactorily established. Hoskins, Cailliaud and Ferlini\r\nwere the first to direct the attention of antiquarians to this quarter,\r\nand the later and more complete researches of Lepsius leave room for\r\nlittle more to be discovered concerning them. It is remarkable that both\r\nBruce and Burckhardt, who traveled by land from Berber to Shendy, failed\r\nto see the ruins, which must have been visible from the road they\r\nfollowed. The former, in fact, speaks of the broken pedestals, carved\r\nstones and pottery which are scattered over the plain, and sagely says,\r\n‘It is impossible to avoid risking a guess that this is the ancient city\r\nof Meroë;’ but he does not mention the groups of pyramids which are so\r\nconspicuous a feature in the landscape. Our path led over a plain\r\ncovered with thorny shrubs at first, but afterward hard black gravel,\r\nand we had not gone more than a mile before the raïs pointed out the\r\npyramids of the ancient Ethiopian city. I knew it only from its mention\r\nin history, and had never read any description of its remains;\r\nconsequently I was surprised to see before me, in the vapory morning\r\nair, what appeared to be the ruins of pylæ and porticos, as grand and\r\nlofty as those of Karnak. Rising between us and the mountains, they had\r\nan imposing effect, and I approached them with excited anticipations. As\r\nadvanced, however, and the morning vapors melted away, I found that they\r\nderived much of their apparent hight from the hill upon which they are\r\nbuilt, and that, instead of being the shattered parts of one immense\r\ntemple, they were a group of separate pyramids, standing amid the ruins\r\nof others which have been completely destroyed.\r\n\r\n“We reached them after a walk of about four miles. They stand upon a\r\nnarrow, crescent-shaped hill, which rises forty or fifty feet from the\r\nplain, presenting its convex front to the Nile, while toward the east\r\nits hollow curve embraces a small valley lying between it and the\r\nmountain range. Its ridge is crowned with a long line of pyramids,\r\nstanding so close to each other that their bases almost meet, but\r\npresenting no regular plan or association, except in the direction of\r\ntheir faces. None of them retains its apex, and they are all more or\r\nless ruined, though two are perfect to within a few courses of the top.\r\nI climbed one of the highest, from which I could overlook the whole\r\ngroup, as well as another cluster, which crowned the summit of a low\r\nridge at the foot of the mountains opposite. Of those among which I\r\nstood, there were sixteen, in different degrees of ruin, besides the\r\nshapeless stone-heaps of many more. They are all built of fine red\r\nsandstone, in regular courses of masonry, the spaces of which are not\r\nfilled, or cased, as in the Egyptian pyramids, except at the corners,\r\nwhich are covered with a narrow hem or molding, in order to give a\r\nsmooth outline. The stones are about eighteen inches high, and the\r\nrecession of each course varies from two to four inches, so that the\r\nhight of the structure is always much greater than the breadth of the\r\nbase. A peculiarity of these pyramids is, that the sides are not\r\nstraight but curved lines, of different degrees of convexity, and the\r\nbreadth of the courses of stone is adjusted with the utmost nicety, so\r\nas to produce this form. They are small, compared with the enormous\r\npiles of Gizeh and Dashoor, but singularly graceful and elegant in\r\nappearance. Not one of the group is more than seventy feet in hight, nor\r\nwhen complete could have exceeded one hundred. All, or nearly all, have\r\na small chamber attached to the exterior, exactly against the center of\r\ntheir eastern sides, but no passage leading into the interior; and from\r\nthe traces of Dr. Lepsius’s labors, by which I plainly saw that he had\r\nattempted in vain to find an entrance, it is evident that they are\r\nmerely solid piles of masonry, and that, if they were intended tombs,\r\nthe bodies were deposited in the outer chambers. Some of these chambers\r\nare entire, except the roof, and their walls are profusely sculptured\r\nwith hieroglyphics, somewhat blurred and worn down, from the effect of\r\nthe summer rains. Their entrances resembled the doorways of temples, on\r\na miniature scale, and the central stones of two of them were sculptured\r\nwith the sacred winged globe. I saw on the jamb of another, a figure of\r\nthe god Horus. The chambers were quite small, and not high enough to\r\nallow me to stand upright. The sculptures have a very different\r\ncharacter from those in the tombs of Thebes, and their resemblance to\r\nthose of the Ptolemaic period was evident at the first glance. The only\r\ncartouches of monarchs which I found were so obliterated that I could\r\nnot identify them; but the figure of one of the kings, grasping in one\r\nhand the hair of a group of captives, while with the other he lifts a\r\nsword to slay them, bears a striking resemblance to that of Ptolemy\r\nEuergetes, on the pylon of the temple at Edfou. Many of the stones in\r\nthe vast heaps which lie scattered over the hills, are covered with\r\nsculptures. I found on some the winged globe and scarabeüs, while others\r\nretained the scroll or fillet which usually covers the sloping corners\r\nof a pylon. On the northern part of the hill I found several blocks of\r\nlimestone, which exhibited a procession of sculptured figures\r\nbrilliantly colored.\r\n\r\n“The last structure on the southern extremity of the hill, is rather a\r\ntower than a pyramid, consisting of a high base or foundation, upon\r\nwhich is raised a square building, the corners presenting a very slight\r\nslope toward the top, which is covered with ruins, indicating that there\r\nwas originally another and narrower story upon it. When complete, it\r\nmust have borne considerable resemblance to the Assyrian towers, the\r\nremains of which are found at Nineveh. On this part of the hill there\r\nare many small detached chambers, all facing the east, and the remains\r\nof a large building. Here Lepsius appears to have expended most of his\r\nlabors; and the heaps of stone and rubbish he has left behind him,\r\nprevent one from getting a very clear idea of the original disposition\r\nof the buildings. He has quarried one of the pyramids down to its base,\r\nwithout finding any chamber within or pit beneath it. My raïs, who was\r\nat a loss to comprehend the object of my visit, spoke of Lepsius as a\r\ngreat Frank astrologer, who had kept hundreds of the people at work for\r\nmany days, and at last found in the earth a multitude of chickens and\r\npigeons, all of solid gold. He then gave the people a great deal of\r\nbacksheesh and went away, taking the golden fowls with him. The most\r\ninteresting object he has revealed is a vaulted room, about twenty feet\r\nlong, which the raïs pointed out as the place where the treasures were\r\nfound. It is possible that he here referred to the discoveries made\r\nabout twenty years ago by Ferlini, who excavated a great quantity of\r\nrings and other ornaments, Greek and Roman, as well as Ethiopian, which\r\nare now in the museum at Berlin. The ceiling of this vault is on the\r\ntrue principle of the arch, with a keystone in the center, which\r\ncircumstance, as well as the character of the sculptures, would seem to\r\nfix the age of the pyramids at a little more than two thousand years. I\r\ntook a sketch of this remarkable cluster of ruins from their northern\r\nend, and afterward another from the valley below, whence each pyramid\r\nappears distinct and separate, no one covering the other. The raïs and\r\nsailors were puzzled what to make of my inspection of the place, but\r\nfinally concluded that I hoped to find a few golden pigeons, which the\r\nFrank astrologer had not carried away. I next visited the eastern group,\r\nwhich consists of ten pyramids, more or less dilapidated, and the ruined\r\nfoundations of six or eight more. The largest, which I ascended,\r\nconsists of thirty-five courses of stone, and is about fifty-three feet\r\nin hight, eight or ten feet of the apex having been hurled down. Each\r\nside of the apex is seventeen paces, or about forty-two feet long, and\r\nthe angle of ascent is consequently much greater than in the pyramids of\r\nEgypt. On the slope of the hill are the substructions of two or three\r\nlarge buildings, of which sufficient remains to show the disposition of\r\nthe chambers and the location of the doorways. Toward the south, near\r\nwhere the valley inclosed between the two groups opens upon the plain,\r\nare the remains of other pyramids and buildings, and some large,\r\nfortress-like ruins are seen on the summits of the mountains to the\r\neast. I would willingly have visited them, but the wind was blowing\r\nfresh, and the raïs was impatient to get back to his vessel. Many of the\r\nstones of the pyramids are covered with rude attempts at sculpturing\r\ncamels and horses; no doubt by the Arabs, for they resemble a\r\nschool-boy’s first drawings on a slate; straight sticks for legs,\r\nsquares for bodies, and triangles for humps.\r\n\r\n“Leaving the ruins to the company of the black goats that were browsing\r\non the dry grass, growing in bunches at their eastern base, I walked to\r\nanother group of pyramids, which lay a mile and a half to the\r\nsouth-west, toward the Nile. As we approached them, a herd of beautiful\r\ngray gazelles started from among the stones and bounded away into the\r\ndesert. ‘These were the tents of the poor people,’ said the raïs,\r\npointing to the pyramids; ‘the Frank found no golden pigeons here.’ They\r\nwere, in fact, smaller and more dilapidated than the others. Some had\r\nplain burial chambers attached to their eastern sides, but the\r\nsculptures were few and insignificant. There were sixteen in all, more\r\nor less ruined. Scattering mounds, abounding with fragments of bricks\r\nand building stones, extended from these ruins nearly to the river’s\r\nbank, a distance of more than two miles; and the foundations of many\r\nother pyramids might be seen among them. The total number of pyramids in\r\na partial state of preservation, (some being nearly perfect, while a few\r\nretained only two or three of the lower courses,) which I counted on the\r\nsite of Meroë, was _forty-two_. Besides these, I noticed the traces of\r\nforty or fifty others, which had been wholly demolished. The entire\r\nnumber, however, of which Meroë could boast, in its prime, was _one\r\nhundred and ninety-six_. The mounds near the river, which cover an\r\nextent of between one and two miles, point out the site of the city, the\r\ncapital of the old hierarchy of Meroë, and the pyramids are no doubt the\r\ntombs of its kings and priests. It is rather singular that the city has\r\nbeen so completely destroyed, as the principal spoilers of Egypt, the\r\nPersians, never penetrated into Ethiopia, and there is no evidence of\r\nthe stones having been used to any extent by the Arabs, as building\r\nmaterials.\r\n\r\n“The examination of Meroë has solved the doubtful question of an\r\nEthiopian civilization anterior to that of Egypt. Hoskins and Cailliaud,\r\nwho attributed a great antiquity to the ruins, were misled by the fact,\r\ndiscovered by Lepsius, that the Ethiopian monarchs adopted as their own,\r\nand placed upon their tombs the nomens of the earlier Pharaohs. It is\r\nnow established beyond a doubt, that, so far from being the oldest,\r\nthese are the _latest_ remains of Egyptian art; their inferiority\r\ndisplays its decadence, and not the rude, original type, whence it\r\nsprang. Starting from Memphis, where not only the oldest Egyptian, but\r\nthe oldest human records yet discovered, are found, the era of\r\ncivilization becomes later, as you ascend the Nile. In Nubia, there are\r\ntraces of Thothmes and Amunoph III., or about fifteen centuries before\r\nthe Christian era; at Napata, the ancient capital of Ethiopia, we can\r\nnot get beyond King Tirhaka, eight centuries later; while at Meroë,\r\nthere is no evidence which can fix the date of the pyramids earlier than\r\nthe first, or at furthest, the second century before Christ. Egypt,\r\ntherefore, was not civilized from Ethiopia, but Ethiopia from Egypt. The\r\nsculptures at Meroë also establish the important fact that the ancient\r\nEthiopians, though of a darker complexion than the Egyptians, (as they\r\nare in fact represented, in _Egyptian_ sculpture,) were, like them, an\r\noffshoot of the great Caucasian race. Whether they were originally\r\nemigrants from northern India and the regions about Cashmere, as the\r\nEgyptians are supposed to have been, or, like the Beni Koreish at a\r\nlater period, crossed over from the Arabian peninsula, is not so easily\r\ndetermined. The theory of Pococke and other scholars, based on the\r\npresumed antiquity of Meroë, that here was the first dawning on African\r\nsoil of that earliest Indian civilization, which afterward culminated at\r\nMemphis and Thebes, is overthrown but we have what is of still greater\r\nsignificance, the knowledge that the highest civilization, in every age\r\nof the world, has been developed by the race to which we belong.\r\n\r\n“I walked slowly back to the boat, over the desolate plain, striving to\r\ncreate from those shapeless piles of ruin the splendor of which they\r\nwere once a part. The sun, and the wind, and the mountains, and the\r\nNile, were what they had ever been; but where the kings and priests of\r\nMeroë walked in the pomp of their triumphal processions, a poor,\r\nsubmissive peasant knelt before me with a gourd full of goat’s milk; and\r\nif I had asked him when that plain had been inhabited, he would have\r\nanswered me, like Chidhar, the prophet: ‘As thou seest it now, so has it\r\nbeen forever!’”\r\n\r\n\r\n                     PYRAMIDS AND RUINS OF MERAWE.\r\n\r\nThere are other pyramids and ruins in Ethiopia that would be worthy of\r\nextended notice, but that they are so far surpassed in number and\r\nmagnificence by those already described. The principal of these are\r\nfound at Merawe, the former capital of Darshygeea, to the north-west of\r\nMeroë, where the Nile, flowing south-west, reaches the frontier of\r\nDongola. This Merawe must not be confounded with Meroë, the ruins of\r\nwhich have just been described. The identity of the sounds of the names,\r\ndid, indeed, at first deceive antiquarians, who supposed the temples and\r\npyramids in this neighborhood to have belonged to the capital of the old\r\nhierarchy of Meroë; but it is now satisfactorily established that they\r\nmark the site of Napata, the capital of Ethiopia up to the time of the\r\nCæsars. It was the limit of the celebrated expedition of the Roman\r\nsoldiers, under Petronius. Djebel Berkel, at whose base the principal\r\nremains are found, is in latitude eighteen degrees, thirty-five minutes,\r\nor thereabouts.\r\n\r\nAs the traveler already quoted, rose in the morning, to go over to the\r\nmountain and the ruins at its base, “I was,” says he, “enchanted with\r\nthe picture which the shores presented. The air was filled with a light,\r\nsilvery vapor, (a characteristic of sultry weather in Africa,) softening\r\nthe deep, rich color of the landscape. The eastern bank was one bower of\r\npalms, standing motionless, in perfect groups, above the long, sloping\r\nbanks of beans in blossom. Such grace and glory, such silence and\r\nrepose, I thought I had never before seen in the vegetable world.\r\nOpposite, the ruined palaces of the old Shygheean kings, and the mud and\r\nstone hovels of modern Merawe, rose in picturesque piles above the river\r\nbank and below the red sandstone bluffs of the Nubian desert, which\r\noverhung them and poured the sand through deep rents and fissures upon\r\ntheir very roofs. The mosque, with a tall, circular minaret, stood\r\nembowered in a garden of date-palms, under one of the highest bluffs. Up\r\nthe river, which stretched glittering into the distance, the forest of\r\ntrees shut out the view of the desert, except Djebel Berkel, which stood\r\nhigh and grand above them; the morning painting its surface with red\r\nlights and purple shadows. Over the misty horizon of the river rose a\r\nsingle conical peak, far away. The sky was a pale, sleepy blue, and all\r\nthat I saw seemed beautiful dream-pictures, everywhere grace, beauty,\r\nsplendor of coloring, steeped in elysian repose. It is impossible to\r\ndescribe the glory of that passage across the river. It paid me for all\r\nthe hardships of the desert.\r\n\r\n“When we touched the other shore and mounted the little donkeys we had\r\ntaken across with us, the ideal character of the scene disappeared, but\r\nleft a reality picturesque and poetic enough. We rode under a cluster of\r\nruined stone buildings, one of which occupied considerable space, rising\r\npylon-like, to the hight of thirty feet. The shekh informed me that it\r\nhad been the palace of a Shygheean king, before the Turks got possession\r\nof the country. It was wholly dilapidated, but a few Arab families were\r\nliving in the stone dwellings which surround it. These clusters of\r\nshattered buildings extend for more than a mile along the river, and are\r\nall now known as Merawe. Our road led between fields of ripening wheat,\r\nrolling in green billows before the breeze, on one side, and on the\r\nother, not more than three yards distant, the naked sandstone walls of\r\nthe desert, where a blade of grass never grew. Over the wheat, along the\r\nbank of the Nile, rose a long forest of palms, so thickly ranged that\r\nthe eye could scarcely penetrate their dense, cool shade; while on the\r\nother hand the glaring sand-hills showed their burning shoulders above\r\nthe bluffs. It was a most violent contrast, and yet, withal, there was a\r\ncertain harmony in these opposite features. We now approached the\r\nmountain, which is between three and four miles from the town. It rises\r\nfrom out the sands of the Nubian desert, to the hight of five hundred\r\nfeet, presenting a front completely perpendicular toward the river. It\r\nis inaccessible on all sides except the north, which in one place has an\r\ninclination of forty-five degrees. Its scarred and shattered walls of\r\nnaked sandstone stand up stern and sublime in the midst of the hot and\r\nlanguid landscape. As we approached, a group of pyramids appeared on the\r\nbrow of a sand-hill to the left, and I discerned at the base of the\r\nmountain several isolated pillars, the stone-piles of ruined pylons, and\r\nother remains of temples. The first we reached was at the south-eastern\r\ncorner of the mountain. Amid heaps of sandstone blocks and disjointed\r\nsegments of pillars, five columns of an exceedingly old form still point\r\nout the court of a temple, whose adyta are hewn within the mountain.\r\nThey are not more than ten feet high and three in diameter, circular,\r\nand without capital or abacus, unless a larger block, rudely sculptured\r\nwith the outlines of a Typhon-head, may be considered as such. The\r\ndoorway is hurled down and defaced, but the cartouches of kings may\r\nstill be traced on the fragments. There are three chambers in the rock,\r\nthe walls of which are covered with sculptures, for the most part\r\nrepresenting the Egyptian divinities. The temple was probably dedicated\r\nto Typhon, or the Evil Principle, as one of the columns is still faced\r\nwith a caryatid of the short, plump, big-mouthed and bat-eared figure,\r\nwhich elsewhere represents him. Over the entrance is the sacred winged\r\nglobe, and the ceiling shows the marks of brilliant coloring. The temple\r\nis not remarkable for its architecture, and can only be interesting in\r\nan antiquarian point of view. It bears some resemblance in its general\r\nstyle to the temple-palace of Goorneh, at Thebes.\r\n\r\n“The eastern base of the mountain, which fronts the Nile, is strewn with\r\nhewn blocks, fragments of capitals, immense masses of dark bluish-gray\r\ngranite, and other remains, which prove that a large and magnificent\r\ntemple once stood there. The excavations made by Lepsius and others have\r\nuncovered the substructions sufficiently to show the general plan of two\r\nbuildings. The main temple was at the north-eastern corner of the\r\nmountain, under the highest point of its perpendicular crags. The\r\nremains of its small propylons stand in advance, about two hundred yards\r\nfrom the rock, going toward which, you climb the mound formed by the\r\nruins of a large pylon, at the foot of which are two colossal ram-headed\r\nsphinxes of blue granite, buried to their necks in the sand. Beyond this\r\nis a portico and pillared court, followed by other courts and labyrinths\r\nof chambers. Several large blocks of granite, all more or less broken\r\nand defaced, lie on the surface or half quarried from the rubbish. They\r\nare very finely polished and contain figures of kings, evidently\r\narranged in genealogical order, each accompanied with his name. The\r\nshekh had a great deal to tell me of the Franks, who dug up all the\r\nplace, and set the people to work at hauling away the lions and rams,\r\nwhich they carried off in ships. I looked in vain for the celebrated\r\npedestal; it has probably become the spoil of Lepsius.\r\n\r\n“It was now noon, and only the pyramids remained to be seen on that side\r\nof the river. The main group is about a third of a mile from the\r\nmountain, on the ridge of a sand-hill. There are six pyramids, nearly\r\nentire, and the foundations of others. They are almost precisely similar\r\nto those of the real Meroë, each having a small exterior chamber on the\r\neastern side. Like the latter, they are built of sandstone blocks, only\r\nfilled at the corners, which are covered with a hem or molding; the\r\nsides of two of them are convex. On all of them the last eight or ten\r\ncourses next the top have been smoothed to follow the slope of the side.\r\nIt was no doubt intended to finish them all in this manner. One of them\r\nhas also the corner molding rounded, so as to form a scroll, like that\r\non the cornice of many of the Egyptian temples. They are not more than\r\nfifty feet in hight, with very narrow bases. One of them, indeed, seems\r\nto be the connecting link between the pyramid and the obelisk. Nearer\r\nthe river is an older pyramid, though no regular courses of stone are to\r\nbe seen any longer. These sepulchral remains, however, are much inferior\r\nto those of Meroë. The oldest names found at Napata are those of Amenoph\r\nIII. and Remeses II. (1630 B. C. and 1400 B. C.) both of whom subjected\r\nNubia to their rule. The remains of Ethiopian art, however, go no\r\nfurther than King Tirkaka, 730 B. C.—the Ethiopian monarch, who, in the\r\ntime of Hezekiah, marched into Palestine to meet Sennacherib, king of\r\nAssyria. Napata, therefore, occupies an intermediate place in history,\r\nbetween Thebes and Meroë, showing the gradual southward progress of\r\nEgyptian art and civilization. It is a curious fact that the old\r\nreligion of Egypt should have been here met face to face, and\r\noverthrown, by Christianity, which, starting in the mountains of\r\nAbyssinia, followed the course of the Nile northward. In the sixth\r\ncentury of our era, Ethiopia and Nubia were converted to Christianity\r\nand remained thus until the fourteenth century, when they fell beneath\r\nthe sword of Islam.\r\n\r\n“The next morning, the shekh proposed going with me to the remains of a\r\ntemple, half an hour distant, on the eastern bank of the river. After\r\nwalking a mile and a half over the sands, which have here crowded the\r\nvegetation to the very water’s edge, we came to a broad mound of stones,\r\nbroken bricks and pottery, with a foundation wall of heavy limestone\r\nblocks, along the western side. There were traces of doors and niches,\r\nand on the summit of the mound the pedestals of columns similar to those\r\nof El Berkel. From this place commenced a waste of ruins, extending for\r\nnearly two miles toward the north-west, while the breadth, from east to\r\nwest, was about equal. For the most part, the buildings were entirely\r\nconcealed by the sand, which was filled with fragments of pottery and\r\nglass, and with shining pebbles of jasper, agate and chalcedony. Half a\r\nmile further, we struck on another mound, of greater extent, though the\r\nbuildings were entirely level with the earth. The foundations of pillars\r\nwere abundant, and fragments of circular limestone blocks lay crumbling\r\nto pieces in the rubbish. The most interesting object was a mutilated\r\nfigure of blue granite, of which only a huge pair of wings could be\r\nrecognized. The shekh said that all the Frank travelers who came there\r\nbroke off a piece and carried it away with them. I did not follow their\r\nexample. Toward the river were many remains of crude brick walls, and\r\nthe ground was strewn with pieces of excellent hard-burnt bricks. The\r\nsand evidently conceals many interesting objects. I saw in one place,\r\nwhere it had fallen in, the entrance to a chamber, wholly below the\r\nsurface. The Arabs were at work in various parts of the plain, digging\r\nup the sand, which they filled in baskets and carried away on donkeys.\r\nThe shekh said it contained salt, and was very good to make wheat grow,\r\nwhence I inferred that the earth is nitrous. We walked for an hour or\r\ntwo over the ruins, finding everywhere the evidence that a large capital\r\nhad once stood on the spot. The bits of water-jars which we picked up\r\nwere frequently painted and glazed with much skill. The soil was in many\r\nplaces wholly composed of the debris of the former dwellings. This was,\r\nwithout doubt, the ancient Napata, of which Djebel Berkel was only the\r\nnecropolis. Napata must have been one of the greatest cities of ancient\r\nAfrica, after Thebes, Memphis and Carthage. I felt a peculiar interest\r\nin wandering over the site of that half-forgotten capital, whereof the\r\nancient historians knew little more than we. That so little is said by\r\nthem in relation to it is somewhat surprising, notwithstanding its\r\ndistance from the Roman frontier.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                    EGYPTIAN TEMPLES AND MONUMENTS.\r\n\r\nReturning from Ethiopia to Egypt, we find not a few of its monuments and\r\ntemples worthy of our notice as wonderful testimonies to the art and\r\nwealth of their ancient builders.\r\n\r\n\r\n                POMPEY’S PILLAR AND CLEOPATRA’S NEEDLE.\r\n\r\nPassing out, toward the south, from modern Alexandria, one of the first\r\nobjects that greets the eye of the traveler, is Pompey’s pillar, which\r\nrears its stupendous mass of polished granite in solitary grandeur, a\r\nmonument of buried empires and of nations that have passed away. Though\r\nit now stands alone, it is supposed to have been but one of the four\r\nhundred stately columns of the Serapeum as it once stood in all its\r\ngrandeur. “This pillar,” says Thompson, “is the one solitary monument of\r\nthe old city upon its southern front, and answers to the one standing\r\nobelisk that is its solitary monument on the north. Of its origin,\r\nhistory is as silent as the mummy of Belzoni’s tomb; but there is no\r\ndoubt that ‘_Pompey’s_ pillar is really a misnomer;’ for the inscription\r\n‘shows it to have been erected by Publius, the prefect of Egypt, in\r\nhonor of Diocletian,’ who subdued a revolt at Alexandria by capturing\r\nthe city, A. D. 296. But whether it was then first hewn from the quarry,\r\nor was transported from some decaying temple up the Nile, the Greek\r\nlettering does not inform us. If the latter, (which, considering the\r\ndecline of art and the pilfering propensities of the Romans, is\r\nprobable,) then this now lonely sentinel, an Egyptian column with a\r\nGreek inscription to a Roman emperor, has witnessed in turn the decay of\r\nEgypt, of Greece, and of Rome, upon the soil where it still disputes\r\nwith Time the empire of the past. To the reader of Gibbon, it may seem\r\nstrange that a monument should have been reared at Alexandria in honor\r\nof a conqueror, who, during a siege of eight months, wasted the city by\r\nthe sword and by fire, and who, when it finally capitulated and implored\r\nhis clemency, caused it to feel ‘the full extent of his severity,’ and\r\ndestroyed ‘thousands of its citizens in a promiscuous slaughter.’ The\r\nfact may serve to show the worthlessness of such monuments as\r\ntestimonials to character, or as expressions of public esteem. But\r\nwhatever may be its history or its associations, one can not look upon\r\nthis column without a feeling of astonishment and awe. Outside of the\r\nmodern city walls and some six hundred yards to the south of them, away\r\nfrom the present homes of men, but on an eminence that overlooks the\r\nentire city, and in striking contrast with the meager, attenuated style\r\nof its present architecture, stands this stupendous column of red\r\ngranite, ninety-nine feet in hight by thirty in circumference, its shaft\r\nan elegant monolith measuring seventy-three feet between the pedestal\r\nand the capital. It marks the site of an ancient stadium, and as some\r\nconjecture, of the gymnasium, which was surrounded with majestic\r\nporticos of granite.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CLEOPATRA’S NEEDLE.]\r\n\r\nFrom Pompey’s pillar, to Cleopatra’s needles, is a distance of about a\r\nmile through the city in a north-easterly direction. “These obelisks,”\r\nsays Thompson, “have no more relation to Cleopatra, than the pillar has\r\nto Pompey. Their hieroglyphics, according to Wilkinson and Lepsius, date\r\nback as far as the exodus from Egypt; and they were brought to\r\nAlexandria from the city of Heliopolis, or _On_, about a hundred miles\r\nto the south. Each ‘_needle_’ is a solid block of red granite, about\r\nseventy feet high, and nearly eight feet in diameter at the base. How\r\nsuch huge blocks were cut from the quarry, transported hundreds of\r\nmiles, and erected upon their pedestals, is a mystery not solved by\r\nanything yet discovered of ancient mechanic arts. Only one of the\r\nobelisks is standing. The other was taken down to be transported to\r\nEngland, but now lies half buried in the mud and sand. On one side of\r\nthe standing obelisk the hieroglyphics are distinctly legible, but on\r\nthe northern or seaward side they are much defaced by the action of the\r\nweather. It stands upon the edge of the great harbor, in a line with the\r\nrock of Pharos that forms the extreme northern point of the horseshoe\r\nport.\r\n\r\n“Besides the pillar and the needles nothing remains to testify the\r\nformer splendor of Alexandria; a capital that once vied with Rome,\r\ncontaining a population equal to that of New York, (three hundred\r\nthousand freemen and as many slaves,) and that so late as the seventh\r\ncentury, according to the testimony of Amrou, its Saracenic conqueror,\r\ncontained ‘four thousand palaces, four thousand baths, four hundred\r\ntheaters, twelve thousand shops for the sale of vegetables, and forty\r\nthousand tributary Jews.’ A few ruins are pointed out, but these are\r\nfast disappearing with the ravages of time. Its name is the only\r\nmemorial of its founder; and the long range of catacombs along the shore\r\nto the west of the city, the sole vestige of its ancient population. So\r\nrapid was the growth of the city, that at the commencement of the\r\nChristian era, it was ‘second only to Rome itself,’ and ‘comprehended a\r\ncircumference of fifteen miles’ within its walls. It was a great seat of\r\ncommerce. ‘Idleness was unknown. Either sex, and every age, was engaged\r\nin the pursuits of industry;’ the blowing of glass, the weaving of\r\nlinen, manufacturing the papyrus, or conducting the lucrative trade of\r\nthe port. Alexander, fresh from the conquest of Tyre, boasted that he\r\nwould here build an emporium of commerce surpassing that which he had\r\nruined, and thus would recreate in his own image the world he had\r\ndestroyed. The site of Alexandria, more felicitous than that of Tyre,\r\npromised to realize his ambitious dream. Its gates ‘looked out on the\r\ngilded barges of the Nile, on fleets at sea under full sail, on a harbor\r\nthat sheltered navies, and a light-house that was the mariner’s star,\r\nand the wonder of the world.’ But neither the felicity of its location,\r\nnor the enterprise of its Ptolemaic rulers, nor the wealth of its\r\ncommerce, nor the learning that gathered to its schools the students of\r\nart, of philosophy, of medicine, of science, and of religion, could\r\nwithstand the march of empire from Asia to Europe, nor the laws of trade\r\nthat followed in its track.”\r\n\r\nThe present population of Alexandria is less than a hundred thousand; a\r\nmixture of all the oriental races, with many Europeans and Jews. In\r\npassing through its narrow and dirty streets, now occupied with a motley\r\nand poverty-stricken populace; in traversing the villages of hovels\r\nwithin its walls, where the Arab lies down with his sheep, his goat, his\r\ndog, and his donkey, all in the mud inclosure of a few feet square,\r\nwhich must be entered by stooping; and in climbing the huge mounds that\r\nare said to cover the ancient capital, it is difficult to realize that\r\nhere once dwelt the hundred thousand Jews, for whom the seventy made\r\ntheir celebrated Greek version of the Old Testament; that here the\r\neloquent Apollos was born, and the learned Athanasius conducted his\r\ntheological controversies; that here Theodosius, by imperial edict,\r\ndestroyed the temple of Serapis, and publicly established Christianity\r\nin place of the outcast divinities of the Egyptian Greeks; that here was\r\na school to which the sages of Greece resorted for instruction in\r\nphilosophy, science and letters, and where Jewish rabbins and Christian\r\napologists vied with Greek dialecticians in the various pursuits of\r\nlearning; and that here was a library of seven hundred thousand\r\nmanuscript volumes, a British museum or a Smithsonian institute,\r\nboasting the originals or the duplicates of many of the most valuable\r\nworks of the then current literature, and which, after the accidental\r\ndestruction of a part of it in the insurrection against Julius Cæsar,\r\nand the willful destruction of another portion in the sanguinary\r\nreligious wars under Theodosius, yet contained enough of written papyrus\r\nto heat for six months the four thousand baths of the city, under the\r\nsummary decree of Omar: “If these writings of the Greeks agree with the\r\nbook of God, they are useless, and need not be preserved; if they\r\ndisagree, they are pernicious, and ought to be destroyed.” It is\r\ndifficult amid such surroundings, to realize that here Cæsar and Antony\r\ndallied with the charms of Cleopatra. It is difficult to realize that\r\nwhere now bigotry, fanaticism and superstition hold sway over an\r\nignorant and degraded people, were schools of theology, and learned\r\nfathers, and astute controversialists of the early Christian church;\r\nthat here Christianity triumphed over paganism in popular tumults backed\r\nby imperial decrees; that here Mark preached the gospel of the kingdom\r\nwhere the Ethiopian eunuch had preceded him with the tidings of the\r\ngreat salvation. And yet that old Alexandria, which began to be in the\r\nfourth century before Christ, and of all whose palaces and temples and\r\nmonuments only two columns are now standing, was the youngest of\r\nEgyptian cities, and was built by the conqueror of Egypt when Thebes,\r\nand Memphis, and the university city of Heliopolis, were already in\r\ntheir decline. Such is the antiquity that meets us at the threshold of\r\nthe land of the Nile.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      THE CATACOMBS OF ALEXANDRIA.\r\n\r\nIn connection with Alexandria, it is in place to speak of its _cryptæ_\r\nor catacombs, a range of primeval sepulchers, on which a prodigious\r\namount of labor must have been bestowed. They are situated about half a\r\nleague along the shore, to the westward of the modern city; and their\r\nintricacy is such, that formerly the guides would not enter them without\r\na clew of thread, which they unwound as they went in, so that by\r\nfollowing it on their return, they might secure their safe retreat. Dr.\r\nClarke is very particular in his description of these subterranean\r\nabodes of the dead; and from his interesting narrative the following\r\nparticulars have been gathered.\r\n\r\nThe original entrance to them is now closed, and is externally concealed\r\nfrom observation. The only place by which admittance to the interior is\r\npracticable, is a small aperture made through the soft and sandy rock,\r\nbarely large enough to admit a person upon his hands and knees. Here,\r\nsometimes, the traveler has encountered jackals, escaping from the\r\ninterior when alarmed by any person approaching; on which account, a gun\r\nor pistol used often to be discharged before entering, to prevent any\r\nsally of this kind. “Having passed this aperture,” says Dr. Clarke,\r\n“with lighted tapers, we arrived, by gradual descent, in a square\r\nchamber, almost filled with earth: to the right and left of this are\r\nsmaller apartments, chiseled in the rock; each of these contains on\r\neither side of it, except that of the entrance, a _soros_ for the\r\nreception of a mummy; but, owing to the accumulation of sand in all of\r\nthem, this part of the catacombs can not be examined without great\r\ndifficulty. Leaving the first chamber, we found a second of still larger\r\ndimensions, having four cryptæ with _soroi_, two on either side, and a\r\nfifth at its extremity toward the south-east. From hence, penetrating\r\ntoward the west, we passed through another forced aperture, which\r\nconducted us into a square chamber, without any receptacles for dead\r\nbodies; thence, pursuing a south-western course, we persevered in\r\neffecting a passage, over heaps of sand, from one chamber to another,\r\nadmiring everywhere the same extraordinary effects of labor and\r\ningenuity, until we found ourselves bewildered with so many passages,\r\nthat our clew of thread became of more importance than we at first\r\nbelieved it would prove to be. At last we reached the stately\r\nantechamber of the principal sepulcher, which had every appearance of\r\nbeing intended for a regal repository. It was of a circular form,\r\nsurmounted by a beautiful dome, hewn out of the rock, with exquisite\r\nperfection, and the purest simplicity of workmanship. In a few of the\r\nchambers we observed pilasters, resembling, in their style of\r\narchitecture, the Doric, with architraves, as in some of the most\r\nancient sepulchers near Jerusalem; but they were all integral parts of\r\nthe solid rock. The dome covering the circular chamber was without\r\nornament; the entrance to it being from the north-west. Opposite to this\r\nentrance was a handsome square crypt with three _soroi_; and to the\r\nright and left were other cryptæ, similarly surrounded with places for\r\nthe dead. Hereabouts we observed the remarkable symbol, sculptured in\r\nrelief, of an orb with extending wings, evidently intended to represent\r\nthe subterraneous sun, or _sol inferus_, as mentioned by Macrobius. We\r\nendeavored to penetrate further toward the south-west and south, and\r\nfound that another complete wing of the vast fabric extended in those\r\ndirections, but the labor of the research was excessive.\r\n\r\n“The cryptæ upon the south-west side corresponded with those which we\r\nhave described toward the north-east. In the middle, between the two, a\r\nlong range of chambers extended from the central and circular shrine\r\ntoward the north-west; and in this direction appears to have been the\r\nprincipal and original entrance. Proceeding toward it we came to a large\r\nroom in the middle of the fabric, between the supposed Serapeum and the\r\nmain outlet, or portal, toward the sea. Here the workmanship was very\r\nelaborate; and to the right and left were chambers, with receptacles\r\nranged parallel to each other. Further on, in the same direction, is a\r\npassage with galleries and spacious apartments on either side; probably\r\nthe chambers for embalming the dead, or those belonging to the priests,\r\nwho constantly officiated in the Serapeum. In the front is a kind of\r\nvestibulum, or porch; but it is exceedingly difficult to ascertain\r\nprecisely the nature of the excavation toward the main entrance, from\r\nthe manner in which it is now choked with earth and rubbish. If this\r\npart were laid open, it is possible that something further would be\r\nknown as to the design of the undertaking; and, at all events, one of\r\nthe most curious of the antiquities of Egypt would then be exposed to\r\nthe investigation it merits. Having passed about six hours in exploring,\r\nto the best of our ability, these gloomy mansions, we regained, by means\r\nof our clew, the aperture by which we had entered, and quitted them\r\nforever.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                          BATHING IN THE EAST.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving Alexandria, it may be interesting to glance at the\r\nprocess and luxury of oriental bathing, so often described by travelers\r\nin Turkey and Egypt. The narrative is from Taylor, who, though deceived\r\nby his dragoman as to the excellence of the bath compared with others\r\nwhich he might have visited, gives us a vivid picture of the process the\r\nbather undergoes, and the full comfort that follows it. He says, “The\r\nbath to which he conducted us, he declared was the finest in Alexandria,\r\nthe most superb in all the orient, but it did not at all accord with our\r\nideas of eastern luxury. Moreover, the bath-keeper was his intimate\r\nfriend, and would bathe us as no Christians were ever bathed before. One\r\nfact Ibrahim kept to himself, which was, that his intimate friend and he\r\nshared the spoils of our inexperience. We were conducted to a one-story\r\nbuilding, of very unprepossessing exterior. As we entered the low,\r\nvaulted entrance, my ears were saluted with a dolorous, groaning sound,\r\nwhich I at first conjectured to proceed from the persons undergoing the\r\noperation, but which I afterward ascertained was made by a wheel turned\r\nby a buffalo, employed in raising water from the well. In a sort of\r\nbasement hall, smelling of soap-suds, and with a large tank of dirty\r\nwater in the center, we were received by the bath-keeper, who showed us\r\ninto a room containing three low divans with pillows. Here we disrobed,\r\nand Ibrahim, who had procured a quantity of napkins, enveloped our heads\r\nin turbans and swathed our loins in a simple Adamite garment. Heavy\r\nwooden clogs were attached to our feet, and an animated bronze statue\r\nled the way through gloomy passages, sometimes hot and steamy, sometimes\r\ncold and soapy, and redolent of anything but the spicy odors of Araby\r\nthe blest, to a small vaulted chamber, lighted by a few apertures in the\r\nceiling. The moist heat was almost suffocating; hot water flowed over\r\nthe stone floor, and the stone benches we sat upon were somewhat cooler\r\nthan kitchen stoves. The bronze individual left us, and very soon,\r\nsweating at every pore, we began to think of the three Hebrews in the\r\nfurnace. Our comfort was not increased by the groaning sound which we\r\nstill heard, and by seeing, through a hole in the door, five or six\r\nnaked figures lying motionless along the edge of a steaming vat, in the\r\nouter room. Presently our statue returned with a pair of coarse\r\nhair-gloves on his hands. He snatched off our turbans, and then, seizing\r\none of my friends by the shoulder as if he had been a sheep, began a\r\nsort of rasping operation upon his back. This process, varied\r\noccasionally by a dash of scalding water, was extended to each of our\r\nthree bodies, and we were then suffered to rest awhile. A course of\r\nsoap-suds followed, which was softer and more pleasant in its effect,\r\nexcept when he took us by the hair, and holding back our heads, scrubbed\r\nour faces most lustily, as if there were no such things as eyes, noses\r\nand mouths. By this time we had reached such a salamandrine temperature\r\nthat the final operation of a dozen pailfuls of hot water poured over\r\nthe head, was really delightful. After a plunge in a seething tank, we\r\nwere led back to our chamber and enveloped in loose muslin robes.\r\nTurbans were bound on our heads and we lay on the divans to recover from\r\nthe languor of the bath. The change produced by our new costume was\r\nastonishing. The stout German became a Turkish mollah, the young\r\nSmyrniote a picturesque Persian, and I—I scarcely know what, but, as my\r\nfriends assured me, a much better Moslem than Frank. Cups of black\r\ncoffee and pipes of inferior tobacco completed the process, and in spite\r\nof the lack of cleanliness and superabundance of fleas, we went forth\r\nlighter in body, and filled with a calm content which nothing seemed\r\nable to disturb.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    EGYPTIAN TEMPLES, MONUMENTS, &C.\r\n\r\nThe ruins of the temple of _Hermopolis_, or the great city of Mercury,\r\nwhich were thought wonderful till the later discoveries in Egypt threw\r\nthem comparatively in the shade, give some idea of the great range and\r\nhigh perfection the arts had attained in that country. Many parts of\r\nthese ruins have preserved their original position, without having been\r\naltered or deformed by the works of modern times, and have remained\r\nuntouched for well nigh four thousand years. They are of freestone, of\r\nthe fineness of marble, and have neither cement, nor any other means of\r\nunion, except the perfect fitting of the respective parts. The colossal\r\nproportions of the edifice, evince the power the Egyptians possessed to\r\nraise such enormous masses. The portico is one hundred and twenty feet\r\nlong, and its hight sixty feet. Not a spring of an arch remains, to\r\nthrow light on the dimensions of the whole extent of the temple, or of\r\nthe nave. The architecture is still richer than the Doric order of the\r\nGreeks. The shafts of the pillars represent _fasciæ_, or bundles; and\r\nthe pedestal, the stem of the lotus. Under the roof between the two\r\nmiddle columns, are winged globes; and all the roofs are ornamented with\r\na wreath of painted stars, of an aurora color on a blue ground.\r\n\r\nThe temple of _Apollinopolis Magna_ is described by Denon as surpassing\r\nin extent, majesty, magnificence, and high preservation, whatever he had\r\nseen in Egypt, or elsewhere. This building is a long suite of pyramidal\r\ngates, of courts decorated with galleries, of porticos, and of covered\r\nnaves, constructed, not with common stones, _but with entire rocks_.\r\nThis superb edifice is situated on a rising ground, so as to overlook,\r\nnot only its immediate vicinity, but the whole valley. On the right is\r\nthe principal gate, placed between two huge mounds of buildings, on the\r\nwalls of which are three orders of hieroglyphic figures, increasing in\r\ntheir gigantic dimensions, insomuch that the last have a length of\r\ntwenty-five feet. The inner court is decorated with a gallery of\r\ncolumns, bearing two terraces, which come out at two gates, through\r\nwhich is the passage to the stairs, leading to the platform of the\r\nmounds. Behind the inner portico are several apartments, and the\r\nsanctuary of the temple. A wall of circumvallation is decorated both\r\nwithin and without with innumerable hieroglyphics, executed in a very\r\nfinished and laborious style. This magnificent temple appears to have\r\nbeen dedicated to the evil genius, the figure of Typhon being\r\nrepresented in relief on the four sides of the plinth which surmounts\r\neach of the capitals. The entire frieze, and all the paintings within,\r\nare descriptive of Isis, defending herself against the attacks of that\r\nmonster.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          THE RUINS OF THEBES.\r\n\r\nThe ruins of the ancient city of Thebes, which Homer has characterized\r\nby the single expression of _the city with a hundred gates_, are of so\r\nimmense an extent as to convince the spectator that fame has not\r\nexaggerated its size. For, as if the diameter of old Egypt was not\r\nsufficient to contain it, its monuments rest on two chains of contiguous\r\nmountains, while its tombs occupy the valleys toward the west,\r\nstretching off into the desert. The large temple on the eastern side is\r\nbetween two and three leagues distant from Medeenet Abou, where the most\r\nwestern temple is situated; and the modern village of Karnak is built on\r\na small part of the site of a single temple, which is half a mile in\r\ncircumference. Of the remains of this temple, Denon tells us, that “of\r\nthe hundred columns of the portico alone, the smallest are seven feet\r\nand a half in diameter, and the largest twelve. The space occupied by\r\nthe circumvallation of the temple contains lakes and mountains. In\r\nshort, to be enabled to form a competent idea of so much magnificence,\r\nthe reader ought to fancy what is before him to be a dream, as he who\r\nviews the objects themselves rubs his eyes to know whether he is awake.\r\nThe avenue leading from Karnak to Luxor, a space nearly half a league in\r\nextent, contains a constant succession of sphinxes and other chimerical\r\nfigures to the right and left, together with fragments of stone walls,\r\nof small columns, and of statues.”\r\n\r\nThe village of Luxor, Denon describes “as also built on the side of the\r\nruins of a temple, not so large as that of Karnak, but in a better state\r\nof preservation, the masses not having as yet fallen through time, and\r\nby the pressure of their own weight. The most colossal parts consist of\r\nfourteen columns of nearly eleven feet in diameter, and of two statues\r\nin granite, at the outer gate, buried up to the middle of the arms, and\r\nhaving in front of them the two largest and best preserved obelisks\r\nknown. The French, when in Egypt, deemed their means insufficient, not\r\nto hew out, but merely to transport these two monuments, which are not\r\nmore than a fragment of one of the numerous edifices of the astonishing\r\ncity of Thebes. They are of rose-color granite, are still seventy feet\r\nabove the ground, and to judge by the depth to which they are supposed\r\nto be covered with sand, are believed to be at least one hundred feet in\r\nhight. Their preservation is perfect, and the hieroglyphics with which\r\nthey are covered being cut deep, and in relief at the bottom, show the\r\nbold hand of a master, and a beautiful finish. The chisels which could\r\ncut such hard materials must have been of an admirable temper; and the\r\nmachines to drag such enormous blocks from the quarries, to transport\r\nthem thither, and to set them upright, together with the time required\r\nfor the labor, surpass all conception!” In speaking of the gate of the\r\ntemple, which is now that of the village of Luxor, Denon remarks as\r\nfollows. “Nothing can be more grand, and at the same time more simple,\r\nthan the small number of objects of which this entrance is composed. No\r\ncity whatever makes so proud a display at its approach as this wretched\r\nvillage, the population of which consists of two or three thousand\r\nsouls, who have taken up their abode on the roofs and beneath the\r\ngalleries of this temple, which has, nevertheless, the air of being in a\r\nmanner uninhabited.”\r\n\r\nThe tombs of the kings of Thebes are grottos consisting of a regular\r\ndouble gallery supported by pillars, behind which is a row of chambers,\r\noften double. In proportion as the hight of these grottos increases,\r\nthey become more richly decorated; and the spectator is soon convinced,\r\nby the magnificence both of the paintings and sculptures, and of the\r\nsubjects they represent, that he is among the tombs of great men or\r\nheroes. Those which appear to have belonged to the ancient kings, are\r\nonly distinguished from the others by the magnificence of the\r\nsarcophagi, and the mysterious solitude of their situation; the others\r\nimmediately overlooking the great buildings in the city. The sculpture\r\nin all is incomparably more labored and more highly finished than that\r\nof the temples, and displays a high perfection of the art. The lines of\r\nthe hieroglyphics have been cut with a firmness of touch, and a\r\nprecision, of which marbles offer but few examples; and the figures have\r\na particular elegance and correctness of contour. Small subjects taken\r\nfrom nature are introduced; and in these the groups of persons are given\r\nin perspective; and cut in deep relief, in simple and natural attitudes.\r\nSeveral of these subjects bear but little analogy to the spot in which\r\nthey are immured; for bass-reliefs are seen representing games, such as\r\nrope-dancing, and asses taught to play tricks and rear on their hind\r\nlegs, sculptured with all the traits of genuine nature and simplicity.\r\nThe plan of these excavations is singular; and many are so vast and\r\ncomplicated, that they might be mistaken for labyrinths, or\r\nsubterraneous temples. After passing the elegant apartments described\r\nabove, long and gloomy galleries present themselves, winding backward\r\nand forward in numerous angles, and seeming to occupy a great extent of\r\nground. They are melancholy, repulsive, and without any decoration; but\r\nopen from time to time into other chambers covered with hieroglyphics,\r\nand branch out into narrow paths, leading to deep perpendicular pits. At\r\nthe bottom of these pits are other adorned chambers; and lower still a\r\nnew series of perpendicular pits and horizontal chambers, until at\r\nlength, ascending a long flight of steps, the visitor reaches an open\r\nplace on a level with the chambers he first entered.\r\n\r\nThus far we have followed the brief outline given by Denon, and the\r\nearlier travelers. But our ideas of these wonderful ruins will become\r\nmuch more enlarged, as well as accurate, by perusing the descriptions of\r\nmore recent tourists and explorers; such for example as Taylor and\r\nThompson. The former, before beginning the recital of his visit, gives\r\nan outline of the topography of Thebes. “The course of the Nile,” he\r\nsays, “is here nearly north, dividing the site of the ancient city into\r\ntwo almost equal parts. On approaching it from Kenneh, the mountain of\r\nGoorneh which abuts on the river, marks the commencement of the western\r\ndivision. This mountain, a range of naked limestone crags, terminating\r\nin a pyramidal peak, gradually recedes to the distance of three miles\r\nfrom the Nile, which it again approaches further south. Nearly the whole\r\nof the curve, which might be called the western wall of the city, is\r\npierced with tombs, among which are those of the queens, and the grand\r\npriestly vaults of the Assasseef. The valley of the kings’ tombs lies\r\ndeep in the heart of the range, seven or eight miles from the river.\r\nAfter passing the corner of the mountain, the first ruin on the western\r\nbank is that of the temple-palace of Goorneh. More than a mile further,\r\nat the base of the mountain, is the Memnonium, or temple of Remeses the\r\nGreat, between which and the Nile the two Memnonian colossi are seated\r\non the plain. Nearly two miles to the south of this is the great temple\r\nof Medeenet Abou, and the fragments of other edifices are met with,\r\nstill further beyond. On the eastern bank, nearly opposite Goorneh,\r\nstands the temple of Karnak, about half a mile from the river. Eight\r\nmiles eastward, at the foot of the Arabian mountains, is the small\r\ntemple of Medamot, which, however, does not appear to have been included\r\nin the limits of Thebes. Luxor is directly on the bank of the Nile, a\r\nmile and a half south of Karnak, and the plain extends several miles\r\nbeyond it, before reaching the isolated range, whose three conical peaks\r\nare the landmarks of Thebes to voyagers on the river. These distances\r\nconvey an idea of the extent of the ancient city, but fail to represent\r\nthe grand proportions of the landscape, so well fitted, in its simple\r\nand majestic outlines, to inclose the most wonderful structures the\r\nworld has ever seen. The green expanse of the plain; the airy coloring\r\nof the mountains; the mild, solemn blue of the cloudless Egyptian sky:\r\nthese are a part of Thebes, and inseparable from the remembrance of its\r\nruins.\r\n\r\n“At sunrise we crossed to the western bank and moored our boat opposite\r\nGoorneh. It is advisable to commence with the tombs, and close the\r\ninspection of that side with Medeenet Abou, reserving Karnak, the\r\ngrandest of all for the last. The most unimportant objects in Thebes are\r\nfull of interest when seen first, whereas Karnak, once seen, fills one’s\r\nthoughts to the exclusion of everything else. There are Arab guides for\r\neach bank, who are quite familiar with all the principal points, and who\r\nhave a quiet and unobtrusive way of directing the traveler; and with one\r\nof them, we set off on a stirring gallop for the temple of Goorneh and\r\nthe valley of the kings’ tombs, leaving Achmet to follow with our\r\nbreakfast, and the Arab boys with their water bottles. The temple of\r\nGoorneh was built for the worship of Amun, the Theban Jupiter, by Osirei\r\nand his son, Remeses the Great, the supposed Sesostris, nearly fourteen\r\nhundred years before the Christian era. It is small, compared with the\r\nother ruins, but interesting from its rude and massive style, a remnant\r\nof the early period of Egyptian architecture. The two pylons in front of\r\nit are shattered down, and the dromos of sphinxes has entirely\r\ndisappeared. The portico is supported by a single row of ten columns,\r\nwhich neither resemble each other, nor are separated by equal spaces.\r\nWhat is most singular, is the fact that notwithstanding this\r\ndisproportion, which is also observable in the doorways, the general\r\neffect is harmonious. We tried to fathom the secret of this, and found\r\nno other explanation than in the lowness of the building, and the rough\r\ngranite blocks of which it is built. One seeks no proportion in a\r\nnatural temple of rock, or a cirque of Druid stones. All that the eye\r\nrequires is rude strength, with a certain approach to order. The effect\r\nproduced by this temple is of a similar character, barring its\r\nhistorical interest. Its dimensions are too small to be imposing, and I\r\nfound, after passing it several times, that I valued it more as a\r\nfeature in the landscape, than for its own sake.\r\n\r\n“The sand and pebbles clattered under the hoofs of our horses, as we\r\ngalloped up the gorge of _Biban el Molook_, the ‘gates of the kings.’\r\nThe sides are perpendicular cliffs of yellow rock, which increased in\r\nhight, the further we advanced, and at last terminated in a sort of\r\nbasin, shut in by precipices several hundred feet in hight and broken\r\ninto fantastic turrets, gables and pinnacles. The bottom is filled with\r\nhuge heaps of sand and broken stones, left from the excavation of the\r\ntombs in the solid rock. There are twenty-one tombs in this valley, more\r\nthan half of which are of great extent and richly adorned with paintings\r\nand sculptures. Some have been filled with sand or otherwise injured by\r\nthe occasional rains which visit this region, while a few are too small\r\nand plain to need visiting. Sir Gardner Wilkinson has numbered them all\r\nin red chalk at the entrances, which is very convenient to those who use\r\nhis work on Egypt as a guide. I visited ten of the principal tombs, to\r\nthe great delight of the old guide, who complained that travelers are\r\nfrequently satisfied with four or five. The general arrangement is the\r\nsame in all, but they differ greatly in extent and in the character of\r\ntheir decoration.\r\n\r\n“The first we entered was the celebrated tomb of Remeses I., discovered\r\nby Belzoni. From the narrow entrance, a precipitous staircase, the walls\r\nof which are covered with columns of hieroglyphics, descends to a depth\r\nof forty feet, where it strikes a horizontal passage leading to an\r\noblong chamber, in which was formerly a deep pit, which Belzoni filled.\r\nThis pit protected the entrance to the royal chamber, which was also\r\ncarefully walled up. In the grace and freedom of the drawings, and the\r\nrichness of their coloring, this tomb surpasses all others. The subjects\r\nrepresented are the victories of the monarch, while in the sepulchral\r\nchamber he is received into the presence of the gods. The limestone rock\r\nis covered with a fine coating of plaster, on which the figures were\r\nfirst drawn with red chalk, and afterward carefully finished in colors.\r\nThe reds, yellows, greens and blues are very brilliant, but seem to have\r\nbeen employed at random, the gods having faces sometimes of one color,\r\nsometimes of another. In the furthest chamber, which was left\r\nunfinished, the subjects are only sketched in red chalk. Some of them\r\nhave the loose and uncertain lines of a pupil’s hand, over which one\r\nsees the bold and rapid corrections of the master. Many of the figures\r\nare remarkable for their strength and freedom of outline. I was greatly\r\ninterested in a procession of men, representing the different nations of\r\nthe earth. The physical peculiarities of the Persian, the Jew and the\r\nEthiopian are therein as distinctly marked as at the present day. The\r\nblacks are perfect counterparts of those I saw daily upon the Nile, and\r\nthe noses of the Jews seem newly painted from originals in New York. The\r\nburial-vault, where Belzoni found the alabaster sarcophagus of the\r\nmonarch, is a noble hall, thirty feet long by nearly twenty in breadth\r\nand hight, with four massive pillars forming a corridor on one side. In\r\naddition to the light of our torches, the Arabs kindled a large bonfire\r\nin the center, which brought out in strong relief the sepulchral figures\r\non the ceiling, painted in white on a ground of dark indigo hue. The\r\npillars and walls of the vault glowed with the vivid variety of their\r\ncolors, and the general effect was unspeakably rich and gorgeous. This\r\ntomb has already fallen a prey to worse plunderers than the Medes and\r\nPersians. Belzoni carried off the sarcophagus, Champollion cut away the\r\nsplendid jambs and architrave of the entrance to the lower chambers, and\r\nLepsius has finished by splitting the pillars and appropriating their\r\nbeautiful paintings for the museum at Berlin. At one spot, where the\r\nlatter has totally ruined a fine doorway, some indignant Frenchman has\r\nwritten in red chalk, ‘_Meurtre commis par Lepsius._’ In all the tombs\r\nof Thebes, wherever you see the most flagrant and shameless spoliations,\r\nthe guide says, ‘Lepsius.’ Who can blame the Arabs for wantonly defacing\r\nthese precious monuments, when such an example is set them by the vanity\r\nof European antiquarians?\r\n\r\n“Bruce’s tomb, which extends for four hundred and twenty feet into the\r\nrock, is larger than Belzoni’s, but not so fresh and brilliant. The main\r\nentrance slopes with a very gradual descent, and has on each side a\r\nnumber of small chambers and niches, apparently for mummies. The\r\nillustrations in these chambers are somewhat defaced, but very curious,\r\non account of the light which they throw upon the domestic life of the\r\nancient Egyptians. They represent the slaughtering of oxen, the\r\npreparation of fowls for the table, the kneading and baking of bread and\r\ncakes, as well as the implements and utensils of the kitchen. In other\r\nplaces the field laborers are employed in leading the water of the Nile\r\ninto canals, cutting dourra, threshing and carrying the grain into\r\nmagazines. One room is filled with furniture, and the row of chairs\r\naround the base of the walls would not be out of place in the most\r\nelegant modern drawing-room. The illustrated catalogue of the London\r\nexhibition contains few richer and more graceful patterns. In a chamber\r\nnearer the royal vault, two old, blind minstrels are seen, playing the\r\nharp in the presence of the king, whence this is sometimes called the\r\nharper’s tomb. The pillars of the grand hall, like those of all the\r\nother tombs we visited, represent the monarch, after death, received\r\ninto the presence of the gods, stately figures, with a calm and serious\r\naspect, and lips, which, like those of the Sphinx, seemed closed upon\r\nsome awful mystery. The absurdity of the coloring does not destroy this\r\neffect, and a blue-faced Isis, whose hard, black eyeball stares from a\r\nbrilliant white socket, is not less impressive than the same figure, cut\r\nin sandstone or granite. The delicacy and precision of the\r\nhieroglyphics, sculptured in intaglio, filled me with astonishment. In\r\nthe tomb of Amunoph III., which I visited the next day, they resembled\r\nthe ciphers engraved upon seals in their exquisite sharpness and\r\nregularity. Only the principal tombs, however, are thus beautified. In\r\nothers the figures are either simply painted, or apparently sunken in\r\nthe plaster, while it was yet fresh, by prepared patterns. The latter\r\nmethod accounts for the exact resemblance of long processions of\r\nfigures, which would otherwise require a most marvelous skill on the\r\npart of the artist. In some unfinished chambers I detected plainly the\r\ntraces of these patterns, where the outlines of the figures were blunt,\r\nand the grain of the plaster bent, and not cut. The family likeness in\r\nthe faces of the monarchs is also too striking, unfortunately, for us to\r\naccept them all as faithful portraits. They are all apparently of the\r\nsame age, and their attributes do not materially differ. This was\r\nprobably a flattery on the part of the artists, or the effect of a royal\r\nvanity, which required to be portrayed in the freshness of youth and the\r\nfull vigor of body and mind. The first faces I learned to recognize were\r\nthose of Remeses II., the supposed Sesostris, and Amunoph III.\r\n\r\n“The tomb of Memnon, as it was called by the Romans, is the most elegant\r\nof all, in its proportions, and is as symmetrical as a Grecian temple.\r\nOn the walls of the entrance are several inscriptions of Greek tourists,\r\nwho visited it in the era of the Ptolemies, and spent their time in\r\ncarving their names, like Americans nowadays. The huge granite\r\nsarcophagus in which the monarch’s mummy was deposited, is broken, as\r\nare those of the other tombs, with a single exception. This is the tomb\r\nof Osirei I., the grandfather of Sesostris, and the oldest in the\r\nvalley. I visited it by crawling through a hole barely large enough to\r\nadmit my body, after which I slid on my back down a passage nearly\r\nchoked with sand, to another hole, opening into the burial chamber. Here\r\nno impious hand had defaced the walls, but the figures were as perfect\r\nand the coloring as brilliant as when first executed. In the center\r\nstood an immense sarcophagus, of a single block of red granite, and the\r\nmassive lid, which had been thrown off, lay beside it. The dust in the\r\nbottom gave out that peculiar mummy odor perceptible in all the tombs,\r\nand in fact long after one has left them, for the clothes become\r\nsaturated with it. The guide, delighted with having dragged me into that\r\nchamber, buried deep in the dumb heart of the mountain, said not a word,\r\nand from the awful stillness of the place and the phantasmagoric gleam\r\nof the wonderful figures on the walls, I could have imagined myself a\r\nneophyte, on the threshold of the Osirian mysteries. We then rode to the\r\nwestern valley, a still deeper and wider glen, containing tombs of the\r\nkings of the foreign dynasty of Atin-Re. We entered the two principal\r\nones, but found the paintings rude and insignificant. There are many\r\nlateral passages and chambers, and in some places deep pits, along the\r\nedge of which we were obliged to crawl. In the last tomb a very long and\r\nsteep staircase descends into the rock. As we were groping after the\r\nguide, I called to my friend to take care, as there was but a single\r\nstep, after making a slip. The words were scarcely out of my mouth\r\nbefore I felt a tremendous thump, followed by a number of smaller ones,\r\nand found myself sitting in a heap of sand, at the bottom, some twenty\r\nor thirty feet below. Fortunately, I came off with but a few slight\r\nbruises.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE TWO COLOSSI.]\r\n\r\n“Returning to the temple of Goorneh, we took a path over the plain,\r\nthrough fields of wheat, lupines and lentils, to _the two colossi_,\r\nwhich we had already seen from a distance. These immense sitting\r\nfigures, fifty-three feet above the plain, which has buried their\r\npedestals, overlook the site of vanished Thebes and assert the grandeur\r\nof which they and Karnak are the most striking remains. They were\r\nerected by Amunoph III., and though the faces are totally disfigured,\r\nthe full, round, beautiful proportions of the colossal arms, shoulders\r\nand thighs do not belie the marvelous sweetness of the features which we\r\nstill see in his tomb. Except the head of Antinous, I know of no ancient\r\nportrait so beautiful as Amunoph. The long and luxuriant hair, flowing\r\nin a hundred ringlets, the soft grace of the forehead, the mild serenity\r\nof the eye, the fine thin lines of the nostrils, and the feminine\r\ntenderness of the full lips, triumph over the cramped rigidity of\r\nEgyptian sculpture, and charm you with the lightness and harmony of\r\nGreek art. In looking on that head, I can not help thinking that the\r\nsubject overpowered the artist, and led him to the threshold of a truer\r\nart. Amunoph, or Memnon, was a poet in soul, and it was meet that his\r\nstatue should salute the rising sun with a sound like that of a\r\nharp-string. Modern research has wholly annihilated this beautiful\r\nfable. Memnon now sounds at all hours of the day, and at the command of\r\nall travelers who will pay an Arab five piasters to climb up into his\r\nlap. We engaged one, who threw off his garments, hooked his fingers and\r\ntoes into the cracks of the polished granite, and soon hailed us with\r\n‘salaam’ from the knee of the statue. There is a certain stone on\r\nMemnon’s lap, which, when sharply struck, gives out a clear, metallic\r\nring. Behind it is a small square aperture, invisible from below, where\r\none of the priests no doubt stationed himself to perform the daily\r\nmiracle. Our Arab rapped on the arms and body of the statue, which had\r\nthe usual dead sound of stone, and rendered the musical ring of the\r\nsun-smitten block the more striking.” And Thompson tells us, that while\r\nhe and his associates sat before it on their donkeys, they saw “a boy of\r\nfifteen, with a solitary rag round his waist, scrambling up the side of\r\nthe statue, and presently he was completely hidden in its lap, just\r\nwhere the sly priest used to hide himself over night. Then striking with\r\na hammer the hollow, sonorous stone, it emitted a sharp, clear sound,\r\nlike the striking of brass,” though it was “not sunrise, but the middle\r\nof a scorching afternoon.” “An avenue of sphinxes,” continues Taylor,\r\n“once led from these colossi to a grand temple, the foundations of which\r\nwe found about a quarter of a mile distant. On the way are the fragments\r\nof two other colossi, one of black granite. The enormous substructions\r\nof the temple and the pedestals of its columns, have been sufficiently\r\nexcavated to show what a superb edifice has been lost to the world. A\r\ncrowd of troublesome Arabs, thrusting upon our attention newly baked\r\ncinerary urns, newly roasted antique wheat, and images of all kinds\r\nfresh from the maker’s hand, disturbed our quiet examination of the\r\nruins, and in order to escape their importunities, we rode to the\r\nMemnonium. This edifice, the temple-palace of Remeses the Great, is\r\nsupposed to be the Memnonium, described by Strabo. It is built on a\r\ngentle rise of land at the foot of the mountain, and looks eastward to\r\nthe Nile and Luxor. The grand stone pylon which stands at the entrance\r\nof its former avenue of sphinxes, has been half leveled by the fury of\r\nthe Persian conquerors; and the colossal granite statue of Remeses, in\r\nthe first court of the temple, now lies in enormous fragments around its\r\npedestal. Mere dimensions give no idea of this immense mass, the weight\r\nof which, when entire, was nearly nine hundred tuns. How poor and\r\ntrifling appear the modern statues which we call colossal, when measured\r\nwith this, one of whose toes is a yard in length; and how futile the\r\nappliances of modern art, when directed to its transportation for a\r\ndistance of one hundred and fifty miles! The architrave at each end of\r\nthe court was upheld by four caryatides, thirty feet in hight. Though\r\nmuch defaced, they are still standing, but are dwarfed by the mighty\r\nlimbs of Remeses. It is difficult to account for the means by which the\r\ncolossus was broken. There are no marks of any instruments which could\r\nhave forced such a mass asunder, and the only plausible conjecture I\r\nhave heard is, that the stone must have been subjected to an intense\r\nheat and afterward to the action of water. The statue, in its sitting\r\nposition, must have been nearly sixty feet in hight, and is the largest\r\nin the world, though not so high as the rock-hewn monoliths of\r\nAboo-Simbel. The Turks and Arabs have cut several mill-stones out of its\r\nhead, without any apparent diminution of its size. The Memnonium differs\r\nfrom the other temples of Egypt in being almost faultless in its\r\nsymmetry, even when measured by the strictest rules of art. I know of\r\nnothing so exquisite as the central colonnade of its grand hall—a double\r\nrow of pillars, forty-five feet in hight and twenty-three in\r\ncircumference, crowned with capitals resembling the bell-shaped blossoms\r\nof the lotus. One must see them to comprehend how this simple form,\r\nwhose expression is all sweetness and tenderness in the flower, softens\r\nand beautifies the solid majesty of the shaft. In spite of their\r\ncolossal proportions, there is nothing massive or heavy in their aspect.\r\nThe cup of the capital curves gently outward from the abacus on which\r\nthe architrave rests, and seems the natural blossom of the columnar\r\nstem. On either side of this perfect colonnade are four rows of Osiride\r\npillars, of smaller size, yet the variety of their form and proportions\r\nonly enhances the harmony of the whole. This is one of those enigmas in\r\narchitecture which puzzle one on his first acquaintance with Egyptian\r\ntemples, and which he is often forced blindly to accept as new laws of\r\nart, because his feeling tells him they are true, and his reason can not\r\nsatisfactorily demonstrate that they are false.\r\n\r\n“We waited till the yellow rays of sunset fell on the capitals of the\r\nMemnonium, and they seemed, like the lotus flowers, to exhale a vapory\r\nlight, before we rode home. All night we wandered in dreams through\r\nkingly vaults, with starry ceilings and illuminated walls; but on\r\nlooking out of our windows at dawn, we saw the red saddle-cloths of our\r\nhorses against the dark background of the palm grove, as they came down\r\nto the boat. No second nap was possible, after such a sight, and many\r\nminutes had not elapsed before we were tasting the cool morning air in\r\nthe delight of a race up and down the shore. Our old guide, however, was\r\non his donkey betimes, and called us off to our duty. We passed Goorneh,\r\nand ascended the eastern face of the mountain to the tombs of the\r\npriests and private citizens of Thebes. For miles along the mountain\r\nside, one sees nothing but heaps of sand and rubbish, with here and\r\nthere an Arab hut, built against the face of a tomb, whose chambers\r\nserve as pigeon-houses and stalls for asses. The earth is filled with\r\nfragments of mummies, and the bandages in which they were wrapped; for\r\neven the sanctity of death itself, is here neither respected by the\r\nArabs nor the Europeans whom they imitate. The first tomb we entered\r\nalmost cured us of the desire to visit another. It was that called the\r\nAssasseef, built by a wealthy priest, and it is the largest in Thebes.\r\nIts outer court measures one hundred and three by seventy-six feet, and\r\nits passages extend between eight and nine hundred feet into the\r\nmountain. We groped our way between walls as black as ink, through long,\r\nlabyrinthine suites of chambers, breathing a deathlike and oppressive\r\nodor. The stairways seemed to lead into the bowels of the earth, and on\r\neither hand yawned pits of uncertain depth. As we advanced, the ghostly\r\nvaults rumbled with a sound like thunder, and hundreds of noisome bats,\r\nscared by the light, dashed against the walls and dropped at our feet.\r\nWe endured this for a little while, but on reaching the entrance to some\r\ndarker and deeper mystery, were so surrounded by the animals, who struck\r\ntheir filthy wings against our faces, that not for ten kings’ tombs\r\nwould we have gone a step further. My friend was on the point of vowing\r\nnever to set his foot in another tomb, but I persuaded him to wait until\r\nwe had seen that of Amunoph. I followed the guide, who enticed me by\r\nflattering promises into a great many snakelike holes, and when he was\r\ntired with crawling in the dust, sent one of our water-carriers in\r\nadvance, who dragged me in and out by the heels.\r\n\r\n“The temple of Medeenet Abou is almost concealed by the ruins of a\r\nCoptic village, among which it stands, and by which it is partially\r\nburied. The outer court, pylon, and main hall of the smaller temple,\r\nrise above the mounds and overlook the plain of Thebes, but scarcely\r\nsatisfy the expectation of the traveler, as he approaches. You first\r\nenter an inclosure surrounded by a low stone wall, and standing in\r\nadvance of the pylon. The rear wall, facing the entrance, contains two\r\nsingle pillars, with bell-shaped capitals, which rise above it and stand\r\nlike guards before the doorway of the pylon. Here was another enigma for\r\nus. Who among modern architects would dare to plant two single pillars\r\nbefore a pyramidal gateway of solid masonry, and then inclose them in a\r\nplain wall, rising to half their hight? Yet here the symmetry of the\r\nshafts is not injured by the wall in which they stand, nor oppressed by\r\nthe ponderous bulk of the pylon. On the contrary, the light columns and\r\nspreading capitals, like a tuft of wild roses hanging from the crevice\r\nof a rock, brighten the rude strength of the masses of stone with a\r\ngleam of singular loveliness. What would otherwise only impress you by\r\nits size, now endears itself to you by its beauty. Is this the effect of\r\nchance, or the result of a finer art than that which flourishes in our\r\nday? I will not pretend to determine, but I must confess that Egypt, in\r\nwhose ruins I had expected to find only a sort of barbaric grandeur, has\r\ngiven me a new insight into that vital beauty which is the soul of true\r\nart. We devoted little time to the ruined court and sanctuaries which\r\nfollow the pylon, and to the lodges of the main temple, standing beside\r\nthem like watch-towers, three stories in hight. The majestic pylon of\r\nthe great temple of Remeses III. rose behind them, out of heaps of\r\npottery and unburnt bricks, and the colossal figure of the monarch in\r\nhis car, borne by two horses into the midst of the routed enemy,\r\nattracted us from a distance. We followed the exterior wall of the\r\ntemple, for its whole length of more than six hundred feet, reading the\r\nsculptured history of his conquests. The entire outer wall of the temple\r\npresents a series of gigantic cartoons, cut in the blocks of sandstone,\r\nof which it is built. Remeses is always the central figure,\r\ndistinguished from subjects and foes, no less by his superior stature,\r\nthan by the royal emblems which accompany him. Here we see heralds\r\nsounding the trumpet in advance of his car, while his troops pass in\r\nreview before him; there, with a lion walking by his side, he sets out\r\non his work of conquest. His soldiers storm a town, and we see them\r\nclimbing the wall with ladders, while a desperate hand-to-hand conflict\r\nis going on below. In another place, he has alighted from his chariot\r\nand stands with his foot on the neck of a slaughtered king. Again, his\r\nvessels attack a hostile navy on the sea. One of the foreign craft\r\nbecomes entangled and is capsized, yet while his spearmen hurl their\r\nweapons among the dismayed enemy, the sailors rescue those who are\r\nstruggling in the flood. After we have passed through these strange and\r\nstirring pictures, we find the monarch reposing on his throne, while his\r\nsoldiers deposit before him the hands of the slaughtered, and his\r\nscribes present to him lists of their numbers, and his generals lead to\r\nhim long processions of fettered captives. Again, he is represented as\r\noffering a group of subject kings to Amun, the Theban Jupiter, who says\r\nto him: ‘Go, my cherished and chosen, make war on foreign nations,\r\nbesiege their forts and carry off their people to live as captives.’ On\r\nthe front wall, he holds in his grasp the hands of a dozen monarchs,\r\nwhile with the other hand he raises his sword to destroy them. Their\r\nfaces express the very extreme of grief and misery, but he is cold and\r\ncalm as fate itself. We slid down the piles of sand and entered by a\r\nside-door into the grand hall of the temple. Here, as at Dendera, a\r\nsurprise awaited us. We stood on the pavement of a magnificent court,\r\nabout one hundred and thirty feet square, around which ran a colonnade\r\nof pillars, eight feet square and forty feet high. On the western side\r\nis an inner row of circular columns, twenty-four feet in circumference,\r\nwith capitals representing the papyrus blossom. The entire court, with\r\nits walls, pillars and doorways, is covered with splendid sculptures and\r\ntraces of paint, and the ceiling is blue as the noonday sky, and studded\r\nwith stars. Against each of the square columns facing the court once\r\nstood a colossal caryatid, upholding the architrave of another colonnade\r\nof granite shafts, nearly all of which have been thrown from their bases\r\nand lie shivered on the pavement. This court opens toward the pylon into\r\nanother of similar dimensions, but buried almost to the capitals of its\r\ncolumns in heaps of rubbish. The character of the temple is totally\r\ndifferent from that of every other in Egypt. Its hight is small in\r\nproportion to its great extent, and it therefore loses the airy\r\nlightness of the Memnonium and the impressive grandeur of Dendera. Its\r\nexpression is that of a massive magnificence, if I may use such a\r\ndoubtful compound: no single epithet suffices to describe it.”\r\n\r\nThe visit to this temple ended our traveler’s survey of the western\r\ndivision of Thebes, “two long days of such experience,” he remarks, “as\r\nthe contemplation of a lifetime can not exhaust;” and at sunset they\r\ncrossed over the Nile, to\r\n\r\n\r\n                         LUXOR AND ITS TEMPLE.\r\n\r\nThe temple of Luxor is imbedded in the modern village, and only the\r\nfront of the pylon, facing toward Karnak, and part of the grand central\r\ncolonnade, are free from its hovels and their accessories. For this\r\nreason, though of much grander proportions than the Memnonium, its\r\neffect is less agreeable and impressive. “Its plan, however,” says\r\nTaylor, “is easily traced; and having been built by only two monarchs,\r\nRemeses the Great and Amunoph III., or, to use their more familiar\r\ntitles, Sesostris and Memnon, it is less bewildering, in a historical\r\npoint of view, to the unstudied tourist, than most of the other temples\r\nof Egypt. The sanctuary, which stands nearest the Nile, is still\r\nprotected by the ancient stone quay, though the river has made rapid\r\nadvances, and threatens finally to undermine Luxor as it has already\r\nundermined the temples of Antæopolis and Antinoë. I rode into what were\r\nonce the sacred chambers, but the pillars and sculptures were covered\r\nwith filth, and the Arabs had built in, around and upon them, like the\r\nclay nests of the cliff-sparrow. The peristyle of majestic Osiride\r\npillars, in front of the portico, as well as the portico itself, are\r\nburied to half their depth, and so surrounded by hovels, that to get an\r\nidea of their arrangement you must make the tour of a number of\r\nhen-houses and asses’ stalls. The pillars are now employed as\r\ndrying-posts for the buffalo dung which the Arabs use as fuel.\r\nProceeding toward the entrance, the next court, which is tolerably free\r\nfrom incumbrances, contains a colonnade of two rows of lotus-crowned\r\ncolumns, twenty-eight feet in circumference. They still uphold their\r\narchitraves of giant blocks of sandstone, and rising high above the\r\nmiserable dwellings of the village, are visible from every part of the\r\nplain of Thebes. The English vice-consul occupies a house between two of\r\nthese pillars. He gave us the agreeable news that the consul was\r\nendeavoring to persuade the pasha to have Karnak cleared of its rubbish\r\nand preserved from further spoliation. If I possessed despotic power,\r\n(and I then wished it for the first time,) I should certainly make\r\ndespotic use of it, in tearing down some dozens of villages and setting\r\nsome thousands of Copts and Fellahs at work in exhuming what their\r\nancestors have mutilated and buried. The world can not spare these\r\nremains. Tear down Roman ruins if you will; level Cyclopean walls; build\r\nbridges with the stones of Gothic abbeys and feudal fortresses; but lay\r\nno hand on the glory and grandeur of Egypt! We ascended the great pylon\r\nof the temple, on the face of the towers of which the victories of\r\nRemeses are sculptured; but his colossi, solid figures of granite, which\r\nsit on either side of the entrance, have been much defaced. The lonely\r\nobelisk, which stands a little in advance, on the left hand, is more\r\nperfect than its Parisian mate. From this stately entrance, an avenue of\r\ncolossal sphinxes once extended to the Ptolemaic pylon of Karnak, a\r\ndistance of a mile and a half. The sphinxes have disappeared, and the\r\nmodern Arab road leads over its site, through fields of waste grass.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                         KARNAK AND ITS RUINS.\r\n\r\n“And now we galloped forward, through a long procession of camels,\r\ndonkeys, and desert Arabs armed with spears, toward Karnak, the greatest\r\nruin in the world, the crowning triumph of Egyptian power and Egyptian\r\nart. Except a broken stone here and there protruding through the soil,\r\nthe plain is as desolate as if it had never been conscious of a human\r\ndwelling; and only on reaching the vicinity of the mud hamlet of Karnak,\r\ncan the traveler realize that he is in Thebes. Here the camel-path drops\r\ninto a broad excavated avenue, lined with fragments of sphinxes and\r\nshaded by starveling acacias. As you advance, the sphinxes are better\r\npreserved and remain seated on their pedestals, but they have all been\r\ndecapitated. Though of colossal proportions, they are seated so close to\r\neach other, that it must have required _nearly two thousand_ to form the\r\ndouble row to Luxor. The avenue finally reaches a single pylon, of\r\nmajestic proportions, built by one of the Ptolemies, and covered with\r\nprofuse hieroglyphics. Passing through this, the sphinxes lead you to\r\nanother pylon, followed by a pillared court and a temple built by the\r\nlater Remesides. This, I thought, while my friend was measuring the\r\ngirth of the pillars, is a good beginning for Karnak, but it is\r\ncertainly much less than I expect. ‘_Tāāl min hennee!_’ (come this way!)\r\ncalled the guide, as if reading my mind, and led me up the heaps of\r\nrubbish to the roof and pointed to the north. Ah, there was Karnak! Had\r\nI been blind up to this time, or had the earth suddenly heaved out of\r\nher breast the remains of the glorious temple? From all parts of the\r\nplain of Thebes I had seen it in the distance—a huge propylon, a\r\nshattered portico, and an obelisk, rising above the palms. Whence this\r\nwilderness of ruins, spreading so far as to seem a city rather than a\r\ntemple; pylon after pylon, tumbling into enormous cubes of stone, long\r\ncolonnades, supporting fragments of Titanic roofs, obelisks of red\r\ngranite, and endless walls and avenues, branching out to isolated\r\nportals? Yet they stood as silently amid the accumulated rubbish of\r\nnearly four thousand years, and the sunshine threw its yellow luster as\r\nserenely over the despoiled sanctuaries, as if it had never been\r\notherwise since the world began. Figures are of no use, in describing a\r\nplace like this, but since I must use them, I may say that the length of\r\nthe ruins before us, from west to east, was twelve hundred feet, and\r\nthat the total circumference of Karnak, including its numerous pylæ, or\r\ngateways, is a mile and a half.\r\n\r\n“We mounted and rode with fast-beating hearts to the western or main\r\nentrance, facing the Nile. The two towers of the propylon (pyramidal\r\nmasses of solid stone) are three hundred and twenty-nine feet in length,\r\nand the one which is least ruined, is nearly one hundred feet in hight.\r\nOn each side of the sculptured portal connecting them, is a tablet left\r\nby the French army, recording the geographical position of the principal\r\nEgyptian temples. We passed through, and entered an open court, more\r\nthan three hundred feet square, with a corridor of immense pillars on\r\neach side, connecting it with the towers of a second pylon, nearly as\r\ngigantic as the first. A colonnade of lofty shafts, leading through the\r\ncenter of the court, once united the two entrances, but they have all\r\nbeen hurled down, and lay as they fell, in long lines of disjointed\r\nblocks, except one, which holds its solitary lotus-bell against the sky.\r\nTwo mutilated colossi of red granite still guard the doorway, whose\r\nlintel-stones are forty feet in length. Climbing over the huge fragments\r\nwhich have fallen from above and almost blocked up the passage, we\r\nlooked down into the grand hall of the temple. I knew the dimensions of\r\nthis hall, beforehand; I knew the number and size of the pillars, but I\r\nwas no more prepared for the reality than those will be, who may read\r\nthis account of it and afterward visit Karnak for themselves. It is the\r\ngreat good luck of travel that many things must be seen to be known.\r\nNothing could have compensated for the loss of that overwhelming\r\nconfusion of awe, astonishment, and delight, which came upon me like a\r\nflood. I looked down an avenue of twelve pillars, six on each side, each\r\nof which was thirty-six feet in circumference and nearly eighty feet in\r\nhight. Crushing as were these ponderous masses of sculptured stone, the\r\nspreading bell of the lotus-blossoms which crowned them, clothed them\r\nwith an atmosphere of lightness and grace. In front, over the top of\r\nanother pile of colossal blocks, two obelisks rose sharp and clear, with\r\nevery emblem legible on their polished sides. On each side of the main\r\naisle are seven other rows of columns, _one hundred and twenty-two_ in\r\nall; each of which is about fifty feet high and twenty-seven in\r\ncircumference. They have the Osiride form, without capitals, and do not\r\nrange with the central shafts. In the efforts of the conquerors to\r\noverthrow them, two have been hurled from their places and thrown\r\nagainst the neighboring ones, where they still lean, as if weary with\r\nholding up the roof of massive sandstone. I walked alone through this\r\nhall, trying to bear the weight of its unutterable majesty and beauty.\r\nThat I had been so oppressed by Dendera, seemed a weakness which I was\r\nresolved to conquer, and I finally succeeded in looking on Karnak with a\r\ncalmness more commensurate with its sublime repose; but not by daylight.\r\nMy next visit was at night, at the time of the full moon. There was a\r\nwan haze in the air, and a pale halo around the moon, on each side of\r\nwhich appeared two faint mock-moons. It was a ghostly light, and the\r\nfresh north wind, coming up the Nile, rustled solemnly in the\r\npalm-trees. We trotted silently to Karnak, and leaped our horses over\r\nthe fragments until we reached the foot of the first obelisk. Here we\r\ndismounted and entered the grand hall of pillars. There was no sound in\r\nall the temple, and the guide, who seemed to comprehend my wish, moved\r\nbehind me as softly as a shadow, and spoke not a word. It needs this\r\nillumination to comprehend Karnak. The unsightly rubbish has\r\ndisappeared: the rents in the roof are atoned for by the moonlight they\r\nadmit; the fragments shivered from the lips of the mighty capitals are\r\nonly the crumpled edges of the flower; a maze of shadows hides the\r\ndesolation of the courts, but every pillar and obelisk, pylon and\r\npropylon is glorified by the moonlight. The soul of Karnak is soothed\r\nand tranquillized. Its halls look upon you no longer with an aspect of\r\npain and humiliation. Every stone seems to say: ‘I am not fallen, for I\r\nhave defied the ages. I am a part of that grandeur which has never seen\r\nits peer, and I shall endure forever, for the world has need of me.’ I\r\nclimbed to the roof, and sat looking down into the hushed and awful\r\ncolonnades, till I was thoroughly penetrated with their august and\r\nsublime expression. I should probably have remained all night, an\r\namateur colossus, with my hands on my knees, had not the silence been\r\ndisturbed by two arrivals of romantic tourists, an Englishman and two\r\nFrenchmen. We exchanged salutations, and I mounted my restless mare\r\nagain, touched her side with the stirrup, and sped back to Luxor. The\r\nguide galloped beside me, occasionally hurling his spear into the air\r\nand catching it as it fell, delighted with my readiness to indulge his\r\ndesert whims. I found the captain and sailors all ready and my friend\r\nsmoking his pipe on deck. In half an hour we had left Thebes.”\r\n\r\nSuch is a faint view of these ruins of forty centuries, the remains of\r\nthat splendid city, Thebes, in comparison with which New York is but an\r\ninfant to the mighty giant! “Yes, proud upstart of _this_ nineteenth\r\ncentury,” says Thompson, “the so-called Empire city, commercial emporium\r\nof the west, great metropolis of the new world, if thy rivers should\r\nsweep over and bury thee, not all the stone of the Croton reservoir, and\r\nthe city hall, and the Astor house, and of a hundred churches forsooth,\r\nwould make one pile like Karnak; nor could any of these furnish a single\r\nstone for the lintels of its gates. Yet Karnak, which began to be in\r\nthat _other_ nineteenth century _before_ Christ, is not yet a ruin! Its\r\ngateways stand; its grand hall stands, its columns nearly all unbroken,\r\nand not one spire of grass, or tuft of moss, or leaf of ivy, hides its\r\nspeaking sculptures. Only the sand has covered them; and when this is\r\nremoved, they are as fresh as yesterday.”\r\n\r\n“Such is the skeleton of Thebes, as we can reconstruct it of such\r\nmaterials and from such localities as yet mark its site. But what was\r\nThebes when, resting upon the Lybian mountains on the west and the\r\nArabian on the east, with the Nile flowing through its center, it filled\r\na circuit of twenty-five miles in a plain of twice that area, teeming\r\nwith fertility! What was Thebes when she could pour forth twenty\r\nthousand chariots of war, and when the grand triumphal procession of\r\npriests, and officers of state, and soldiers, and captives, swept\r\nthrough these colossal avenues to grace the conqueror’s return! What was\r\nThebes when, by the way of the Red sea, Arabia and the Indies poured all\r\ntheir commerce into her lap, and the Nile brought her the spoils of\r\nEthiopia and of the great sea! What was Thebes when she possessed\r\nwealth, and mechanic arts, and physical force, to rear such monuments\r\neven in the midst of war, and sometimes more than one in the reign of a\r\nsingle monarch! What was Thebes, with all the arts and inventions of\r\ncivilized life that are sculptured upon the tombs of her kings to mark\r\nthe progress of their day; from building arches and bridges, to\r\nglass-blowing and porcelain manufactures, to the making of umbrellas,\r\nfans, chairs, and divans, fine linens, and all the appurtenances of a\r\nmodern drawing-room! What was Thebes when all merchants resorted thither\r\nfrom Persia, from Ethiopia, from Lybia, and the Levant! What was Thebes\r\nwhen the artists and scholars of infant Greece and Rome went thither to\r\nschool! Was not Egypt the mother of nations? Where is the art of Greece\r\nor Rome that was not tutored in Egypt; that has not simply graced\r\nEgyptian forms—nor always this? Where is the philosophy of Greece or\r\nRome that was not borrowed from Egypt? Even the divine Plato, who only\r\nwaited for the true Logos, learned at Egypt’s shrine. Egypt gave birth\r\nto art, gave birth to thought, before Greece and Rome were born. She was\r\nthe grand repository of human power; the originator of all great forms\r\nof human development; the originator, the inventor, the great prototype\r\nof the world’s history, here laid up in her hieroglyphic archives. In\r\nall material things, yes, and in all great intellectual forms, in\r\npoetry, in art, in philosophy, in science, and in the religion of\r\nnature, this nineteenth century is but the recipient of the mighty past.\r\nWhatever she has of these, she but inherits through Rome and Greece from\r\ntheir old mother Egypt. What she has better than these, she has by gift\r\ndivine, through that Christianity which purifies, enfranchises, and\r\nennobles man, reforms society, and makes free the state. If she hold\r\nfast by this, she will become resplendent with a glory that Egypt never\r\nknew; but if she slight this, and sell her birthright for luxury and\r\npower, the meanest grave at Thebes would suffice to bury this nineteenth\r\ncentury with its boasted inventions.“\r\n\r\n\r\n                      THEBES, AS SEEN IN HISTORY.\r\n\r\nAll the mere ruins of Thebes, however, immense and magnificent as they\r\nare, fail to give us true views of her greatness, till we go back to her\r\norigin, and trace up her history; and this is so graphically done by\r\nThompson, in his “Egypt, Past and Present,” that we quote from it, what\r\nhe so appropriately calls “_Dissolving Views: Panorama of Karnak._” “In\r\norder,” he says, “to a complete view of Thebes, past and present, one\r\nshould reproduce its sculptured story, and make it witness for itself.\r\nThe temple of Karnak, in its several parts, marks the rise, the growth,\r\nthe decline, and the fall of Egypt. This temple had a growth of\r\ntwenty-five hundred years, from a small sanctuary to ‘a city of\r\ntemples.’ Every principal era of the national history is represented in\r\nthis stupendous pile; and as we go leisurely around it, and translate\r\ninto our own language, or vivify into present actual scenes, the\r\nprocessions, the battles, the ceremonies, the religious offerings, and\r\nthe state displays, sculptured on its walls and columns, and for the\r\nmost part still legible, we behold all Egypt move before us _as in a\r\npanorama_, whose scenes and actors are instinct with life. This animated\r\nreproduction of the sculptures, which I attempted when on the ground, I\r\nwould hope to convey to the reader by following in course the histories\r\nhere written on the stone.\r\n\r\n“I stood in Karnak, under the light of the full moon. It was an hour for\r\nsilence, and we enjoined this upon each other, and gave ourselves to\r\nsolitary musing. The cuckoo, that had wooed us with his note as we\r\nreposed under the great pillars in the sultry noon, had gone to nestle\r\nwith his mate; and the myriad birds that by day had fluttered along the\r\ncorridors, had hid themselves in the crevices of the capitals. Even the\r\nowl that hooted as we entered, was still. Only the moon was there,\r\nthreading the avenues with silver footsteps, and holding her clear light\r\nthat we might read the sculptured chronicles of kings. We sat down in\r\nthe center of the grand avenue. Twelve majestic pillars, on either hand,\r\ntowered along its length, and seemed, as of old, to support an arch of\r\nazure studded with stars. The dismantled towers of the grand entrance,\r\nwhose bases stand like pyramids truncated to sustain the firmament, grew\r\nmore gigantic in the shadow of the columns, while their once massive\r\ngates, uncovered by the hand of time, seemed only to have lifted up\r\ntheir heads to let the King of Glory in. In the avenue that crossed\r\nbeside our seat, (one of twelve, having each ten columns of huge\r\ndimensions,) at either extremity, a column had fallen crosswise against\r\nits neighbor, carrying with it its fragment of the stone roof, and there\r\nit hung almost ethereal in the still moonlight, a symbol of the struggle\r\nbetween man and time. Under the corridors, darkness brooded over the\r\nfragments of sculptured stone; but beyond the other portal, the yet\r\nperfect obelisk stood in pensive majesty among its fallen mates, and\r\nfrom its clear, hard face projected in the moonbeams the symbols of the\r\npower that built these halls, and of the worship that sustained them.\r\nThe spell of Egypt was complete. For two months I had lived under its\r\ndeepening power. At length, in the sepulchers of its kings, and on the\r\nwalls and pillars of its temples, I had seen the Egypt of forty\r\ncenturies revived as in a panorama fresh from the artist’s pencil, and\r\nhad lived in the Egypt that the Nile _then_ watered, as in the so-called\r\nEgypt that it waters now. And here I had come to bid it farewell, to\r\ntake a last look at its grave; and yet the witching moonlight made it\r\n_live_ again. The breath of the south fanning the columns that in their\r\nfourth decade of centuries wear no ivied wreath of age, warmed their\r\nstill grandeur into life, and with Memnon’s charm they sang to the moon\r\nthe great epic of the past. As I listened, all art, all learning, all\r\nreligion, all poetry, all history, all empire, and all time, swept\r\nthrough my wondering soul. Leaving my companions, I wandered over the\r\nfragments of columns and sphinxes and colossi, till, gaining a mound\r\nthat half buries the front area of the temple, I clambered up the steps\r\nworn by age in its stupendous wall, and standing in their foremost\r\ntower, looked back on Karnak. But no change of place, nor sight of\r\nfallen columns and decaying walls, could break the spell. I had walked\r\nover the grave of Egypt, I had stumbled against the fragments of its\r\nsepulcher, yet Egypt stood before me.\r\n\r\n“First came the second son of Ham, with a long retinue of camels and of\r\nservants, lured southward by the fertile valley of the Nile, till, where\r\nthe mountains widen their embrace around the well-watered plain, he\r\npitches his tent, and founds an infant city. Generations pass, and the\r\nson who in this plain inherits the patriarchal wealth and power, greedy\r\nof the patrimony of his brethren to the north, wages a fratricidal war,\r\nand seizing upon all Mizr or ‘the land of Ham,’ effaces from it the name\r\nof his ancestors, and, investing it with his own, gives _Egypt_ (Copt or\r\nGurt) a name and a power in the newly divided earth. Other generations\r\npass, and the first _king_ of Egypt comes with barbaric pomp, from the\r\ncapital he has founded at the north, to visit his native _Theba_, the\r\nreal ‘_head_’ or capital, and here offers to its divinity the rude\r\nshrine whose traces linger behind yonder obelisk. Ages roll on. The\r\nswelling Nile pours out increasing fatness on the land. The earth brings\r\nforth by handfuls. Fat-fleshed, well-favored cattle come up out of the\r\nriver and feed in the meadow. There is great plenteousness for man and\r\nbeast. But with all the plenty there is no waste. In every city huge\r\ngranaries are built, and in these the grain is piled, as the sand of the\r\nsea, without measure. There is a strange wisdom near the throne of\r\nPharaoh. Again, the east wind blows, and the scorching sands of the\r\nArabian desert are heaped upon the fertile Nile. In the mountains of\r\nEthiopia there is no rain. The river shrinks away. The plain of Thebes\r\nis dry. The people cry for bread, but the keys of the great storehouses\r\nare in the hand of the ruler of the land. They bring to him their money;\r\nthey bring to him their cattle; they sell to him their land: they sell\r\nto him their very selves for bread. Again, the east wind ceases; the\r\nrains fall, the river rises; the desert retreats; the land revives. And\r\nnow the great Pharaoh, whom the counsel of a captive Jew has made\r\npossessor of all the treasure and all the land of Egypt, moved by a\r\nreligious sentiment but half enlightened, would make a votive offering\r\nto his god. A fleet of barges covers the bosom of the Nile, which with\r\nwaving banners and gorgeous emblems and increasing music, have borne the\r\nmonarch from his northern to his southern capital. With solemn pomp the\r\nprocession of priests and soldiers and chief officers of state, with the\r\nuplifted monarch in the midst, files from the river to the rude\r\nsanctuary of _Menes_, which the skill of masons and of sculptors has\r\nalready surrounded with columns of rich red granite, and chambers of\r\npolished stone, and with colossal statues of the king—the offering he\r\nbrings to the divinity, whom he adores as the preserver of the land; and\r\nwhile the monarch bows before the god, the sound of trumpets, and the\r\nfragrance of incense, and the chanting of the priests, announce to the\r\nmultitude that _Amun_ accepts the gift, and will be henceforth worshiped\r\nin their temple. _Osirtasen_ the Great passes away.\r\n\r\n“The ages roll. A native Theban usurps the throne of the northern\r\nPharaohs, and succeeds to the power they had consolidated through the\r\ncounsel of the Hebrew, vouchsafed to them through fourscore years. But\r\nJoseph is dead; embalmed and coffined in a royal sarcophagus; and Amosis\r\nthe usurper knows him not. Oppression fills the land, and falls most\r\nheavily upon the seed of Joseph. Another Theban Pharaoh mounts the\r\nthrone, and to preserve the power that the wisdom of a Hebrew gave,\r\ndetermines to cut off the issue of the Hebrews from the land. Yet in his\r\nown house, even as a son, in all the learning of his schools, amid all\r\nthe splendors of his court, is nurtured a young Hebrew who yet shall\r\ndesolate the land that Joseph blessed. But just now this rising terror\r\nhas fled into the desert, and the first _Thothmes_ comes in peaceful\r\npomp to offer to the divinity of Thebes the gigantic obelisks that bear\r\nhis name. He plants them yonder in the area before the sanctuary of\r\nOsirtasen. The third Thothmes is on the throne. There is groaning\r\nthroughout the land of Egypt; there is deep sorrow in the land of\r\nGoshen. The monarch would make his name immortal by the temples, the\r\npalaces, and the monuments he rears in every city, from the great sea to\r\nthe cataracts of Nubia. He adorns his native capital upon its western\r\nbank with a new sanctuary added to the temple of his father, and with\r\nanother temple inclosed with brick, that bear in hieroglyphics his own\r\ninitials; and here at Karnak, he builds behind the sanctuary, a thousand\r\nfeet from where I stand, the grand edifice of fifty columns that\r\nsurpasses all the royal architecture yet seen in Thebes. In its adytum\r\nhe enshrines a colossal figure of the deified hawk that he worships. He\r\nis the great architect of Egypt, and he will fill the land with the\r\nmemorials of his reign. Heliopolis and Noph, Zoan and Sin, attest his\r\ngrandeur. But the voice of another God now thunders in his ear. The\r\nexiled Hebrew has returned. The land is filled with plagues, frogs,\r\nlice, flies, blood, murrain, hail, locusts, darkness, death. The king\r\nhas gone from Thebes to Zoan, his most northern seat, where these\r\njudgments overtake him. The land of Goshen, that had sweltered under his\r\nexactions, breathes more freely, and he lets the people go. But\r\ngathering his chariots of war in mad haste, he pursues them, and hems\r\nthem in between the mountains and the sea. Eager for his prey, he\r\nplunges into the channel God has made for them, and the proud architect\r\nof Egypt returns not, even to occupy the gorgeous tomb he had prepared\r\nfor himself at Thebes.\r\n\r\n“The ages roll on, and a mighty conqueror sits on the throne of Egypt.\r\nWith his myriad chariots he sweeps Ethiopia on the south, and Canaan on\r\nthe north, and gathering all the forces of the Nile, he shakes Lebanon\r\nwith his tread, and scatters the hosts of Syria on the plains of the\r\nEuphrates. And now there is an unwonted stir in Thebes. From all Egypt\r\nthe priests and the great men are gathered to greet the conqueror’s\r\nreturn. In the distance, amid clouds of infantry, is seen the chariot of\r\nthe king. Bound to his chariot wheels are the captive princes he has\r\ntaken in his wars. Behind him are his son, and the royal scribe who\r\nbears the record of his victories. A long line of captives, bound about\r\nthe necks with cords, follow in his train. The cortege moves from temple\r\nto temple through the city, till it reaches that of Karnak. Here,\r\nalighting from his chariot, the monarch enters the temple of Amunre, to\r\npresent his captives and booty to the protecting deity of Thebes; then\r\nlaying his captives on the block, with a ponderous club he dashes out\r\ntheir brains as a sacrifice to the god, and amid the acclamations of the\r\npeople, is borne like a god to his own palace. And now the conqueror,\r\nreposing on his laurels, gives himself to the work of enriching the\r\ncapital with new and more splendid edifices for the honor of its\r\ndivinities, and the commemoration of his reign. From all Egypt are\r\nsummoned the masons and sculptors, the painters and artificers and\r\n‘cunning workmen;’ and the army that had stormed the hights of Lebanon\r\nnow levies from the mountains of the Arabian desert their tribute of\r\nlimestone and sandstone and granite of various hues, of syenite and\r\nporphyry and alabaster, to construct these temples, and to adorn these\r\navenues. The grand hall of Karnak rises in its majestic proportions, a\r\nfit approach to the sanctuary of Amun. Its gates lift up their heads.\r\nIts tenfold avenues rear their massive, lofty, graceful pillars—each a\r\nsingle stone hewn into a rounded, swelling shaft, with a wreathed or\r\nflowered capital—and with their roof of solid stone, compose the portico\r\nthat there in the moonlight, restored to its original perfection, stands\r\nconfessed the wonder of the world. The chisel sculptures on its walls\r\nand columns the battle scenes of the king and his offerings to the god,\r\nand the name of _Osirei_ passes into history. His son succeeds to his\r\nvictories and to his glory. For, on the far off plains of Asia, the\r\ngreat Sesostris breaks the power of the Assyrian hosts, and leads their\r\ncaptive chiefs in chains. Babylon bows to Egypt. There is another day of\r\nexultation in the capital; but the pomp of the returning Osirei pales\r\nbefore the national ovation to his son. The priests, in their sacred\r\nvestments, go forth to meet him, bearing aloft the figures of his\r\nillustrious ancestors, from Menes to Osirei. The king, alighting from\r\nhis chariot, mounts the triumphal car prepared for his reception, whose\r\nfiery steeds are led by liveried grooms. His fan-bearers wave the\r\nflabella over his head, and the priests and the chief men of the nation\r\nkneel in homage at his throne. And now the grand procession forms to\r\nenter the city. Trumpeters herald its approach, and bands of music, with\r\nchoristers, form the van. In long line the priests and officers of state\r\nprecede the monarch, bearing scepters, arms, and other insignia, and the\r\ncushioned steps of the throne. The statues of his ancestors head the\r\nroyal column, and after these is borne a statue of the god upon men’s\r\nshoulders under a gilded canopy. The sacred bull, adorned with garlands,\r\nis led by members of the sacerdotal order. The monarch is attended by\r\nhis scribes, who exhibit proudly the scroll of his achievements. Behind\r\nhis car are dragged the captives, their chained hands uplifted for\r\nmercy, and their cries and lamentations mingling wildly with the bursts\r\nof music and the shouts of the multitude. These are followed by the\r\nspoils of war—oxen, chariots, horses, and sacks of gold; and beyond, a\r\ncorps of infantry in close array, flanked by numerous chariots, bring up\r\nthe rear. The vast throng sweep from temple to temple, and rend the air\r\nwith acclamations. At length the divinity, that had been taken from its\r\nshrine to welcome the victor, is brought before its own adytum. Here the\r\nhigh-priest offers incense to the monarch, who, in turn, alights from\r\nhis throne and burns incense to the god. And now the horrid sacrifice of\r\nwar is made to the patron deity. The wretched captives are beaten in the\r\npresence of the king; their right hands are cut off, and being counted\r\nby the scribes, are retained as trophies: their persons are horribly\r\nmutilated; their heads are severed by the sword or mangled by the mace,\r\nand the gorgeous, barbarous scene is closed.\r\n\r\n“There is peace in Egypt; and the king builds, on yonder western bank,\r\nthe majestic and beautiful Memnonium, covers its walls with the story of\r\nhis victories, and sets before its gate the stupendous statue of\r\nhimself, the symbol of the grandeur and the power of Egypt, enthroned in\r\na sublime and an immortal repose. He builds the vast area of Luxor, with\r\nits massive gates and towers, and before these plants colossal statues\r\nof himself and lofty obelisks, and lines with huge symbolic sculptures\r\nthe avenue to Karnak. Here he lays up before the shrine of Amun, as\r\ndepicted on the walls, a gorgeous barge overlaid with gold without, and\r\nwith silver within, a tribute from the spoils of war. He enriches the\r\nwalls of the grand hall by adding to the sculptured story of his\r\nfather’s reign the battle scenes of his own, and before the portico\r\nconstructs this area of a hundred thousand square feet, surrounded with\r\nits covered corridor, and adorned with sphinxes and a central avenue of\r\ntufted columns, and faced with these stupendous towers. He throws around\r\nthe whole a massive wall, and Karnak stands complete in the glory of the\r\ngreat Remeses. Then follows the resplendent dynasty of all the Osirei\r\nand the Remeses, and Egypt culminates to its meridian splendor. Her\r\nschools rise with her temples, and the epic bard of Scio sings the\r\n‘hundred gates of Thebes,’ while the priests and the philosophers of\r\nyoung Greece resort to the mother of mythology and of letters, and\r\nGrecian sculptors come to study the forms and creations of the mother of\r\nart. The king of Israel, whose fame for wisdom and for wealth is known\r\nin all the earth, wooes the daughter of the king of Egypt, and she whom\r\n‘the sun had looked upon’ on the confines of Ethiopia, shines in the\r\ngolden palace at Jerusalem, ‘beautiful as Tirzeh, and comely as the\r\ntents of Kedar.’\r\n\r\n“But again the hosts of Egypt are marshaled for battle; again they sweep\r\nthe borders of the north; again is heard the shout of victory; again\r\nThebes is astir for the conqueror’s return. Now _Shishak_ brings to the\r\ntemple of Amun the treasures of the house of Jehovah at Jerusalem; the\r\ngolden shields of Solomon, and the treasures of the palace he had built.\r\nTwelve hundred chariots, and sixty thousand horsemen, and footmen\r\nwithout number, swell the train of the victorious king. Nailing the\r\nheads of his wretched captives to the block of the executioner, he whets\r\nhis sword to sacrifice them to the god; and the blood of Israel once\r\nmore cries to God from the land of Egypt. From afar the voice of the\r\nprophet speaks the answer of Jehovah to that cry: ‘Behold, I am against\r\nPharaoh king of Egypt, and will break his arms; and I will cause the\r\nsword to fall out of his hand. Howl ye; woe, woe the day! For the day is\r\nnear, even the day of the Lord is near, a cloudy day. The sword shall\r\ncome upon Egypt; and the pride of her power shall come down.’ Again a\r\nmighty host, sweeping from the north, hovers upon the plain of Thebes.\r\nThe idols are moved in their temples, the cry of the people is in the\r\nstreets. But it is not now the return of her victorious king that stirs\r\nthe royal city. The great _ram_ from the plains of Persia, pushing\r\nwestward and southward, gores Egypt with his horns, overthrows her\r\ntemples and her statues, treads Memnon and Remeses in the dust, drinks\r\nup the river and devours the valley. There is sorrow and groaning in the\r\nland of Egypt for a hundred years, when lo! again the dust of mighty\r\nhosts sweeps from the north. The _he-goat_ from the west, moved with\r\ncholer at the ram, that drinks up the great rivers, rushes upon him in\r\nthe fury of his power, and casts him down and stamps upon him. The\r\nPersian conqueror of Thebes retires before the Macedonian conqueror of\r\nPersia. Greece, though a conqueror, pays homage to Egypt as her\r\nmistress. New cities are built; temples and monuments are restored. Upon\r\nthe plain of Thebes, new works of art unite the sculptured records of\r\nthe Ptolemies with the broken tablets of the Pharaohs. Karnak itself\r\nopens new portals, and revives its ancient splendor. Again the schools\r\nof Egypt are visited from Greece. And where Homer drank his inspiration,\r\nand Herodotus pored over the hieroglyphics, and the papyrus records, and\r\nthe dim traditions of the _then_ old world, Plato comes to ponder the\r\ngreat mysteries of the soul’s existence, and its relations to the\r\ninfinite.\r\n\r\n“But the doom of Egypt is not yet fulfilled. Her resurrection can not\r\nnow come. The gigantic _horn_ that sweeps the stars, trails the young\r\nEgypt of Alexander in the dust. Again she lifts her head and wooes her\r\nconqueror to repose awhile in the lap of luxury. Beauty usurps the\r\ndominion of power; and the golden barge of Cleopatra sweeps up the Nile\r\nwith silken sails perfumed with sweetest odors, or moves with silver\r\noars attuned to the soft melody of lutes. Rome adds her tamer art to the\r\ngreat majesty of Egypt, and restores yet further what the Persian had\r\ndestroyed. Yet Egypt may not rise. A new power enters to possess the\r\nland. Under the Roman name, the religion that had visited the land with\r\nAbraham, with Joseph, and with Moses, comes to enshrine itself in these\r\nold temples, emptied of their gods and broken in their forms. The voice\r\nof prayer and praise to the God of Israel is heard in the temple built\r\nby their oppressor, and the name of the infant whom Egypt sheltered, is\r\nspoken with reverence and adoration in all her holy places. Yonder, in\r\nthe furthest temple of this mighty pile, a Christian church assembles;\r\nthere, in the court of Luxor, stands another Christian altar, while,\r\nacross the river, the colonnade of Medeenet Abou encompasses the lesser\r\ncolumns of a Christian temple built within its folds. But the spirit of\r\nthe old temple lingers in its form, and with it embraces the new. Again\r\nthe liveried priests march through the corridors, bearing mysterious\r\nsymbols, and chanting unknown strains. Again the pomp of state is\r\nblended with the pomp of worship, and the pictured saint but plasters\r\nover the sculptured deity. The religion and the empire of Rome are alike\r\n_effete_, and can give no life to Egypt. And now barbaric hordes from\r\nthe east pour in upon the land, and sweep these both away. The sword of\r\nthe Moslem, hacking the plastered walls, writes there in blood the\r\nforgotten truth, _there is one God_, though it add thereto the\r\nstupendous lie, that makes the other cardinal of his religion. The wild\r\nman of the desert pitches his tent upon the plain where Mizraim halted\r\ncenturies before, or hides himself under the cover of broken tombs and\r\ntemples. He hardly moves from his retreat, when the imperious Turk, his\r\nbrother Moslem, proclaims himself master of Egypt and Arabia by the will\r\nof God. And now here sits the Arab on this luxurious plain, among these\r\ncrumbling giants of the past, startled at his own shadow, without the\r\nspirit to fight either for himself against his tyrant, or for his\r\ncountry in that tyrant’s service. Here he sits, where Osirei and Remeses\r\nand Shishak have chronicled their names and deeds beside their own\r\ngigantic portraits. Here he sits, where moved in royal state the\r\nconqueror of Ethiopia, of Judah, of Syria, and of Babylon. Here he sits,\r\nwhere the fierce Cambyses dealt his retribution; where Alexander moved\r\nwith a pomp that none but he could boast; where Cæsar followed in the\r\ntrain of mighty men—yet owned the greater might of woman. Here he\r\nsits—‘_Il faut descendre_,’ said my guide, who had tortured his Arabic\r\ngutturals into a rude French; ‘_il faut descendre_,’ (it is necessary to\r\ngo down.) _Il faut descendre_, repeated I, as I looked over upon the\r\ntombs of the kings, all drear and ghostly in the moonlight; and looked\r\nwhere Memnon stood, and all was desolate; and looked toward Luxor, where\r\nthe moonlight stole faintly through its broken towers; and turned and\r\nlooked at Karnak, as the meridian moon now shone upon heaps of rubbish,\r\nand broken columns, and crumbling walls. _Il faut descendre_, IT MUST GO\r\nDOWN; and, turning to descend, I stumbled over an Arab hovel, plastered\r\nupon the very top of the tower of Sesostris, and heard the yelping of\r\nthe dogs from the huts that bury the side temple of the conqueror of\r\nBabylon. The spell was broken; and Egypt was a dream. Riding back, amid\r\nbarking dogs and shivering, shrinking Arabs, over the dusty plain to\r\nLuxor, I lay down upon the divan where, two months before, I had dreamed\r\nof Egypt, when, entering the Nile, I felt her resistless spell. But no\r\ndream of Egypt came. Egypt herself had vanished. _As a dream when one\r\nawaketh, so, O Lord, when thou awakedst, thou didst despise her image._”\r\n\r\n\r\n                       OTHER RUINS IN EGYPT, &C.\r\n\r\nThere are in Egypt and the valley of the Nile, numerous other ruins,\r\nrelics and monuments of the mighty past, on which it would be most\r\ninteresting and instructive to dwell, were they not overshadowed by the\r\nwonderful structures we have been considering. Some of these, however,\r\nought not to be passed without notice.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         THE TEMPLE OF DENDERA.\r\n\r\nThe temple of Dendera (formerly Tentyra) is on the western bank of the\r\nNile, nearly opposite Kenneh. Passing from the latter place, the path of\r\nthe traveler leads through a palm grove, where the lofty shafts of the\r\ndate and the vaulted foliage of the doum-palm, blend in the most\r\npicturesque groupage, and in contrast with the lace-like texture of the\r\nflowering mimosa, and the cloudy boughs of a kind of gray cypress.\r\nCrossing the meadows to Dendera, leagues of rank grass roll away toward\r\nthe desert in shining billows, while the wind wafts the rich and mingled\r\nodors of the various flowers on the traveler’s course. In the midst of\r\nthis beautiful plain, rise the earthy mounds of Dendera; and the portico\r\nof the temple, almost buried beneath them, stands like a beacon, marking\r\nthe boundary of the desert. “We galloped our animals along the dike,”\r\nsays a late traveler, “and dismounted at a small pylon, which stands two\r\nor three hundred paces in front of the temple. The huge jambs of\r\nsandstone, covered with sharply cut hieroglyphics and figures of the\r\nEgyptian gods, and surmounted by a single block, bearing the mysterious\r\nwinged globe and serpent, detained us but a moment, and we hurried down\r\nwhat was once the dromos of the temple, now represented by a double wall\r\nof unburnt bricks. The portico, more than a hundred feet in length, and\r\nsupported by six columns, united by screens of masonry, no stone of\r\nwhich, or of the columns themselves, is unsculptured, is massive and\r\nimposing, but struck me as being too depressed to produce a very grand\r\neffect. What was my astonishment, on arriving at the entrance, to find\r\nthat I had approached the temple on a level with half its hight, and\r\nthat the pavement of the portico was as far below as the scrolls of its\r\ncornice were above me. The six columns I had seen, covered three other\r\nrows, of six each, all adorned with the most elaborate sculpture and\r\nexhibiting traces of the brilliant coloring which they once possessed.\r\nThe entire temple, which is in an excellent state of preservation,\r\nexcept where the hand of the Coptic Christian has defaced its\r\nsculptures, was cleaned out by order of Mohammed Ali, and as all its\r\nchambers, as well as the roof of enormous sandstone blocks, are entire,\r\nit is considered one of the most complete relics of Egyptian art. I find\r\nmy pen at fault, when I attempt to describe the impression produced by\r\nthe splendid portico. The twenty-four columns, each of which is sixty\r\nfeet in hight, and eight feet in diameter, crowded upon a surface of one\r\nhundred feet by seventy, are oppressive in their grandeur. The dim\r\nlight, admitted through the half closed front, which faces the north,\r\nspreads a mysterious gloom around these mighty shafts, crowned with the\r\nfourfold visage of Athor, still rebuking the impious hands that have\r\nmarred her solemn beauty. On the walls, between columns of\r\nhieroglyphics, and the cartouches of the Cæsars and the Ptolemies,\r\nappear the principal Egyptian deities, the rigid Osiris, the stately\r\nIsis and the hawk-headed Orus. Around the bases of the columns spring\r\nthe leaves of the sacred lotus, and the dark-blue ceiling is spangled\r\nwith stars, between the wings of the divine emblem. The sculptures are\r\nall in raised relief, and there is no stone in the temple without them.\r\nI can not explain to myself the unusual emotion I felt while\r\ncontemplating this wonderful combination of a simple and sublime\r\narchitectural style with the utmost elaboration of ornament. My blood\r\npulsed fast and warm on my first view of the Roman forum, but in Dendera\r\nI was so saddened and oppressed, that I scarcely dared speak for fear of\r\nbetraying an unmanly weakness. The portico opens into a hall, supported\r\nby six beautiful columns, of smaller proportions, and lighted by a\r\nsquare aperture in the solid roof. On either side are chambers connected\r\nwith dim and lofty passages, and beyond is the sanctuary and various\r\nother apartments, which receive no light from without. We examined their\r\nsculptures by the aid of torches, and our Arab attendants kindled large\r\nfires of dry corn-stalks, which cast a strong red light on the walls.\r\nThe temple is devoted to Athor, the Egyptian Venus, and her image is\r\neverywhere seen, receiving the homage of her worshipers. Even the dark\r\nstaircase, leading to the roof, up which we climbed over heaps of sand\r\nand rubbish, is decorated throughout with processions of symbolical\r\nfigures. The drawing has little of that grotesque stiffness which I\r\nexpected to find in Egyptian sculptures, and the execution is so\r\nadmirable in its gradations of light and shade, as to resemble, at a\r\nlittle distance, a monochromatic painting. The antiquarians view these\r\nremains with little interest, as they date from the comparatively recent\r\nera of the Ptolemies, at which time sculpture and architecture were on\r\nthe decline. We, who had seen nothing else of the kind, were charmed\r\nwith the grace and elegance of this sumptuous mode of decoration. Part\r\nof the temple was built by Cleopatra, whose portrait, with that of her\r\nson Cæsarion, may still be seen on the exterior wall. The face of the\r\ncolossal figure has been nearly destroyed, but there is a smaller one,\r\nwhose soft, voluptuous outline is still sufficient evidence of the\r\njustness of her renown. The profile is exquisitely beautiful. The\r\nforehead and nose approach the Greek standard, but the mouth is more\r\nroundly and delicately curved, and the chin and cheek are fuller. Were\r\nsuch an outline made plastic, were the blank face colored with a pale\r\nolive hue, through which should blush a faint, rosy tinge, lighted with\r\nbold black eyes and irradiated with the lightning of a passionate\r\nnature, it would even now ‘move the mighty hearts of captains and of\r\nkings.’ Besides the temple, there are also the remains of a chapel of\r\nIsis, with a pylon, erected by Augustus Cæsar, and a small temple,\r\nnearly whelmed in the sand, supposed to be one of the _mammeisi_, or\r\nlying-in houses of the goddess Athor, who was honored in this form, on\r\naccount of having given birth to the third member of the divine triad.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                 THE TEMPLES OF HERMONTIS AND OF ESNEH.\r\n\r\nPassing up the Nile, on the same side of it, and nearly opposite Luxor\r\nand Karnak, is the village of Erment, the ancient _Hermontis_, which is\r\nstill graced with a small temple to the goddess Reto. “The group of\r\npillars in the outer court,” says Taylor, “charmed us by the richness\r\nand variety of their designs. No two capitals are of similar pattern,\r\nwhile in their combinations of the papyrus, the lotus and the palm-leaf,\r\nthey harmonize one with another and as a whole. The abacus, between the\r\ncapital and the architrave, is so high as almost to resemble a second\r\nshaft. In Karnak and the Memnonium it is narrow, and lifts the ponderous\r\nbeam just enough to prevent its oppressing the lightness of the capital.\r\nI was so delighted with the pillars of Hermontis that I scarcely knew\r\nwhether to call this peculiarity a grace or a defect. I have never seen\r\nit employed in modern architecture, and judge therefore that it has\r\neither been condemned by our rules or that our architects have not the\r\nskill and daring of the Egyptians. We reached Esneh the same night, but\r\nwere obliged to remain all the next day in order to allow our sailors to\r\nbake their bread. We employed the time in visiting the temple, the only\r\nremnant of the ancient Latopolis, and the palace of Abbas Pasha, on the\r\nbank of the Nile. The portico of the temple, half buried in rubbish,\r\nlike that of Dendera, which it resembles in design, is exceedingly\r\nbeautiful. Each of its twenty-four columns is crowned with a different\r\ncapital, so chaste and elegant in their execution that it is impossible\r\nto give any one the preference. The designs are mostly copied from the\r\ndoum-palm, the date-palm, and the lotus, but the cane, the vine, and\r\nvarious water-plants are also introduced. The building dates from the\r\ntime of the Ptolemies, and its sculptures are uninteresting. We devoted\r\nall our time to the study of the capitals, a labyrinth of beauty, in\r\nwhich we were soon entangled. The governor of Esneh, a most friendly and\r\nagreeable Arab, accompanied us through the temple, and pointed out all\r\nthe fishes, birds and crocodiles he could find, to him the most\r\ninteresting things in it.” The same day they also visited the rock tombs\r\nof El-Kab, the ancient Eleuthyas, which are among the most curious in\r\nEgypt. “There are a large number of these, but only two are worth\r\nvisiting, on account of the light which they throw on the social life of\r\nthe Egyptians. The owner of the tomb and his wife, a red man and a\r\nyellow woman, are here seen, receiving the delighted guests. Seats are\r\ngiven them, and each is presented with an aromatic flower, while the\r\nservants in the kitchen hasten to prepare savory dishes. In other\r\ncompartments, all the most minute processes of agriculture are\r\nrepresented with wonderful fidelity. So little change has taken place in\r\nthree thousand years, that they would answer, with scarcely a\r\ncorrection, as illustrations of the Fellah agriculture of modern Egypt.”\r\n\r\nThe northern part of Nubia abounds in Egyptian remains, such, for\r\nexample, as the temples of Dabod, Kalabshee, Dakkeh, Dendoor, Sebooa,\r\n&c., &c.; and the whole valley of the Nile is filled with the ruins of\r\ncities whose names have hardly survived their overthrow. Noticing but\r\ntwo or three more of these ruins, we will then pass on to other themes.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   ABYDOS, AND THE TEMPLE OF MEMNON.\r\n\r\nAbydos was the reputed burial-place of Osiris, one of the most sacred\r\ngods of ancient Egypt. According to Strabo, it formerly held the next\r\nrank to Thebes, and judging from its ruins, Wilkinson thinks it yielded\r\nto few cities in upper Egypt in size and magnificence. Going toward it\r\nfrom Girgeh, says Thompson, “we came upon a mound of sand and dust, and\r\nbroken bricks and pottery, strewed over with bleaching human bones, and\r\nascending this for several rods, and to an elevation of about sixty\r\nfeet, we came out upon the massive blocks of stone that form the _roof_\r\nof the old temple-palace of Memnon. Here, crawling upon our hands and\r\nknees, we got under the roof far enough to see that it covers two large\r\nhalls supported by rows of massive columns, whose capitals are in the\r\nform of the lotus bud, still distinctly preserved. The walls, as far as\r\ncould be seen, are covered with sculptures, among which the ibis\r\nfrequently recurs; there are also ceremonial processions and battle\r\nscenes, such as are usually depicted in the sculptures of Egyptian\r\ntemples. No doubt, if this temple should be excavated, it would be one\r\nof the most remarkable monuments in Egypt. It dates back nearly fourteen\r\nhundred years before Christ. The formation of the roof was peculiar.\r\nLarge blocks of stone were laid endwise from one row of columns to the\r\nother, and then an arch was hollowed out of this solid masonry, still\r\nleaving a roof two feet in thickness at its center. The stones were so\r\nnicely adjusted, that they fitted closely without cement. The ceiling\r\nwas studded with stars, and with sculptures beautifully colored. I have\r\nnot seen in Egypt more exquisite workmanship. Yet the visitor is doomed\r\nto disappointment through the great difficulty of access to the temple,\r\nin consequence of the drifting in of the sand from the desert and the\r\nneighboring mountains. Near by is another temple, also inaccessible, the\r\ntemple of Osiris, built by the great Remeses, and enriched with\r\nalabaster walls, some fragments of which may yet be found. The\r\nneighboring mountains are filled with tombs, some of which are nearly\r\nfour thousand years old. Everything indicates that here was the site of\r\na great city, a city of wealth, population and power, enriched with\r\ntrophies of conquest and monuments of religion. But these buried temples\r\nalone remain, and the Arabs, who now squat in their rags upon the top of\r\nthe splendid sanctuary of Osiris, have given to the place the expressive\r\nname of ‘_The Buried_.’”\r\n\r\n\r\n                      THE TEMPLES OF ABOU SIMBEL.\r\n\r\nPassing up the Nile to about latitude twenty-two degrees, on its west\r\nside, nearly up to the second cataract, we come to the temples of Abou\r\nSimbel. Reaching the bank of the river about midnight, the traveler we\r\nhave so often quoted tells us: “As I was awakened from a deep sleep by\r\nthe shock of the boat striking the shore, I saw a huge wall of rock\r\nbefore me, against which six enormous statues leaned as they looked from\r\ndeep niches cut in its front. Their solemn faces were touched by the\r\nmoon, which shone full on the cliff, and only their feet were wrapped in\r\nshadow. The lines of deep-cut hieroglyphics over the portal of this\r\nrocky temple were also filled with shadow, and painted legibly on the\r\ngray, moonlit rock. Below them yawned the door, a square of complete\r\ndarkness. A little to the left, over a long drift of sand that sloped\r\nfrom the summit of the cliff nearly to the water’s edge, peered the\r\nmitered head of a statue of still more colossal proportions. I gazed on\r\nthis broad, dim, and wonderful picture for a moment, so awed by its\r\nmajesty that I did not ask myself where nor what it was. This is some\r\ngrand Egyptian dream, was my first thought, and I closed my eyes for a\r\nfew seconds, to see whether it would vanish. But it stood fast and\r\nsilent as ever, and I knew it to be _Abou Simbel_. My servants all\r\nslept, and the raïs and boys noiselessly moored the boat to the shore,\r\nand then lay down and slept also. Still I lay, and the great statues\r\nlooked solemnly down upon me, and the moon painted their kingly nomens\r\nand banners with yet darker distinctness on the gray rock. In the\r\nmorning, I found that we lay at the foot of the smaller temple. I\r\nquietly waited for my cup of coffee, for the morning reality was\r\ninfinitely less grand than my vision of the night. I then climbed to the\r\ndoor and entered. The interior is not large nor imposing, after one has\r\nseen the temples of Egypt. The exterior, however, is on such a colossal\r\nscale, that, notwithstanding the want of proportion in the different\r\nstatues, the effect is very striking. The largest ones are about\r\nthirty-five feet high, and not identical, as are those of the great\r\ntemple. One, who stands with one leg advanced, while he holds a sword\r\nwith the handle pressed against his breast, is executed with much more\r\nspirit than is usually met with in statues of this period. The\r\nsculptures of the interior are interesting, and being of the time of\r\nRemeses the Great, whose history they illustrate, are executed with much\r\nskill and labor. The head of the goddess Athor, on the face of the\r\ncolumns in the hall, is much less beautiful than that of the same\r\ngoddess at Dendera. It is, in fact, almost broad and distorted enough to\r\nrepresent the genius Typhon.\r\n\r\n“The front of the great temple is not parallel to that of the other, nor\r\ndoes it face the river, which here flows in a north-east course. The\r\nline of the cliff is broken between the two, so that the figures of the\r\ngreat Remeses, seated on each side of the door, look to the east, the\r\ndirection of the line of the face being nearly north. Through the gap in\r\nfront, the sands have poured down from the desert behind, almost wholly\r\nfilling up the space between the two cliffs; and though since the temple\r\nwas first opened, in 1817, it has been cleared nearly to the base more\r\nthan once, the rapid accumulation of sand has again almost closed the\r\nentrance. The southern colossus is only buried about half-way to the\r\nknee, but of the two northern ones there is little else to be seen\r\nexcept the heads. Obscured as is the effect of this grand front, it is\r\nstill without parallel in the world. I had not thought it possible that\r\nin statues of such enormous magnitude there could be such singular\r\nbeauty of expression. The face of Remeses, the same in each, is\r\nundoubtedly a portrait, as it resembles the faces of the statues in the\r\ninterior, and those of the king in other places. Besides, there is an\r\nindividuality in some of the features which is too marked to represent\r\nany general type of the Egyptian head. The fullness of the drooping\r\neyelid, which yet does not cover the large, oblong Egyptian eye; the\r\nnose, at first slightly inclining to the aquiline, but curving to the\r\nround, broad nostrils; the generous breadth of the calm lips, and the\r\nplacid, serene expression of the face, are worthy of the conqueror of\r\nAfrica and the builder of Karnak and Medeenet Abou. The statue next the\r\ndoor, on the southern side, has been shivered to the throne on which it\r\nis seated, and the fragments are not to be seen, except a few which lie\r\nupon the knees. The great doorway of the temple is so choked up with\r\nsand, that I was obliged to creep in on my knees. The sun by this time\r\nhad risen exactly to the only point where it can illumine the interior;\r\nand the rays, taking a more yellow hue from the rock and sand on which\r\nthey fell, shone down the long drift between the double row of colossal\r\nstatues, and lighted up the entrance to the second hall of the temple. I\r\nsat down in the sand, awed and half frightened by the singular\r\nappearance of the place. The sunshine, falling obliquely on the sands,\r\nstruck a dim reflection against the sculptured roof, and even lighted up\r\nthe furthest recesses of the grand hall sufficiently to show its\r\nimposing dimensions. Eight square pillars, four on either side of the\r\ncentral aisle, seem to uphold the roof, and on their inner sides, facing\r\neach other, are eight statues of the king. The features of all are\r\npreserved, and have something of the grace and serenity, though not the\r\nmajesty, of the great statues outside. They look into each other’s eyes,\r\nwith an eternal question on their fixed countenances, but none can give\r\nanswer. There was something so stern and strange in these eight faces,\r\nthat I felt a shudder of fear creep over me. The strong arms are all\r\ncrossed on their breasts, and the hands hold various sacred and regal\r\nsymbols, conspicuous among which is something resembling a flail, which\r\none sees often in Egyptian sculpture. I thought of a marvelous story I\r\nonce read, in which a genie, armed with a brazen flail, stands at the\r\nentrance of an enchanted castle, crushing with the stroke of his\r\nterrible weapon all who come to seek the treasure within. For a moment\r\nthe childish faith in the supernatural was as strong as ever, and I\r\nlooked at the gloomy entrance beyond, wishing to enter, but fearing the\r\nstony flails of the terrible Remesi on either hand. The faces were once\r\npartially colored, and the black eyeball, still remaining on the blank\r\neye of stone, gives them an expression of stupor, of death in life,\r\nwhich accounted to me for the nervous shock I experienced on entering.\r\n\r\n“There is nothing in Egypt which can be likened to the great temple of\r\nAbou-Simbel. Karnak is grander, but its grandeur is human. This belongs\r\nrather to the superhuman fancies of the East—the halls of the Afrites—or\r\nto the realm of the dethroned Titans, of early Greek mythology. This\r\nimpression is not diminished, on passing the second hall and corridor,\r\nand entering the adytum, or sacred chamber of the temple. There the\r\ngranite altar yet stands in the center, before the undestroyed figures\r\nof the gods, who, seated side by side, calmly await the offerings of\r\ntheir worshipers. The peculiar individuality of each deity is strikingly\r\nshown in these large statues, and their attitude is much less\r\nconstrained than in the sitting statues in the tombs of Thebes. These\r\nlook as if they _could_ rise, if they would. The walls are covered with\r\nsculptures of them and of the contemplar deities, in the grand, bold\r\nstyle of the age of Remeses. Some visitors had left a supply of dry\r\npalm-branches near the entrance, and of these I made torches, which\r\nblazed and crackled fiercely, flaring with a rich red light on the\r\nsculptured and painted walls. There was sufficient to enable me to\r\nexamine all the smaller chambers, of which there are eight or nine, cut\r\nlaterally into the rock, without any attempt at symmetry of form, or\r\nregularity of arrangement. Several of them have seats running around\r\nthree sides, exactly like the divans in modern Egyptian houses. They\r\nwere probably designed for the apartments of the priests or servants\r\nconnected with the temple. The sculptures on the walls of the grand hall\r\nare, after those of Medeenet Abou, and on the exterior wall of Karnak,\r\nthe most interesting I have seen in Egypt. On the end wall, on either\r\nside of the entrance, is a colossal bass-relief, representing Remeses\r\nslaying a group of captive kings, whom he holds by the hair of their\r\nheads. There are ten or twelve in each group, and the features, though\r\nthey are not colored, exhibit the same distinction of race as I had\r\npreviously remarked in Belzoni’s tomb, at Thebes. There is the negro,\r\nthe Persian, the Jew, and one other form of countenance which I could\r\nnot make out, all imploring with uplifted hands the mercy of the\r\nconqueror. On the southern wall, the distinction between the negro and\r\nthe Egyptian is made still more obvious by the coloring of the figures.\r\nIn fact, I see no reason whatever to doubt that the peculiar\r\ncharacteristics of the different races of men were as strongly marked in\r\nthe days of Remeses as at present. The sculptures on the side walls of\r\nthe temple represent the wars of Remeses, who, as at Medeenet Abou,\r\nstands in a chariot which two horses at full speed whirl into the ranks\r\nof the enemy. The king discharges his arrows against them, and directly\r\nin front of him a charioteer, mortally wounded, is hurled from his\r\noverthrown chariot. The groups are chiseled with great spirit and\r\nboldness; the figures of the king and his horses are full of life.\r\nTowering over all, as well by his superior proportions as by the majesty\r\nand courage of his attitude, Remeses stands erect and motionless amid\r\nthe shock and jar and riot of battle. There is no exultation in his\r\nface; only the inflexible calmness of destiny. I spent some time\r\ncontemplating these grand and remarkable memorials of the greatest age\r\nof Egypt, and left with my feeling for Egyptian art even stronger than\r\nbefore.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                            THE RIVER NILE.\r\n\r\n                              “With annual pomp,\r\n      Rich king of floods! o’erflows the swelling Nile!”—THOMPSON.\r\n\r\nThough the river Nile is properly to be classified with the wonders of\r\nnature, rather than with those of art, yet as it is so intimately and\r\nconstantly associated with the wonderful ruins that everywhere line its\r\nbanks, it may be well to notice it before passing from the wonders of\r\nEgypt and of the regions south of it. This celebrated river, which\r\ndivides Egypt into two parts, and passes on south through Nubia,\r\nEthiopia, &c., is formed mainly by two streams, the Blue Nile and the\r\nWhite Nile. The Blue Nile, the sources of which were discovered by\r\nBruce, rises near latitude eleven degrees north, in the mountains of\r\nGodjam, on the south-western frontier of Abyssinia, and flows with a\r\nwinding course some eight hundred miles to Khartoum, where it unites\r\nwith the western branch of the river, thus forming the main stream. The\r\nsources of the White Nile (so called from the light brown, muddy color\r\nof its waters, as the Blue is from the dark bluish-green of its stream)\r\nare as yet undiscovered. Twelve hundred miles above its junction, and\r\nthirty-three hundred above the Mediterranean, it is still a broad and\r\npowerful stream, of whose source even the tribes that dwell in those far\r\noff regions are ignorant. Taylor is confident, that when its hidden\r\nfountains shall at last be reached, and the problem of twenty centuries\r\nsolved, the entire length of the Nile will be found to be not less than\r\n_four thousand miles_, and that it will take rank with the Mississippi\r\nand the Amazon, as one of the three great streams of the world. In some\r\nrespects, he says, “there is a striking resemblance between the Nile and\r\nthe former river. The Missouri is the true Mississippi, rolling the\r\nlargest flood, and giving its color to the mingled streams. So the White\r\nNile, which is broad and turbid, pollutes the clear blue flood that has\r\nusurped his name and dignity. In spite of what geographers may say, and\r\nthey are still far from being united on the subject, the Blue Nile is\r\nnot the true Nile. There, at the point of junction, his volume of water\r\nis greater, but he is fresh from the mountains and constantly fed by\r\nlarge, unfailing affluents, while the White Nile has rolled for more\r\nthan a thousand miles on nearly a dead level, through a porous, alluvial\r\nsoil, in which he loses more water than he brings with him.” The two\r\nrivers meet at right angles, but do not mingle their waters till they\r\nhave rolled some eight or ten miles in their common bed. Both rivers are\r\nof about the same breadth at the point of confluence, but the current of\r\nthe Blue branch is the strongest. On this account, the native boatmen\r\nspeak of the Blue river as _he_, and of the White as _she_. And it is\r\nremarkable that the name Nile, which is never heard in Egypt, (where the\r\nriver is called _el-bahr_, “the sea,”) is retained in Ethiopia, and\r\nthere applied to the Blue Nile, probably for the same reason.\r\n\r\nThe White Nile has been traced up by Dr. Knoblecher and his associates\r\nfurther than by any one before him. In January, 1850, he passed the\r\nfurthest point reached by any previous expedition; and on the sixteenth\r\nof that month reached the village of Logwek, which takes its name from a\r\nsolitary granite peak about six hundred feet high, which stands on the\r\nleft bank of the Nile. This is in latitude four degrees and ten minutes\r\nnorth, and is the most southern point which has yet been reached on the\r\nWhite Nile. Dr. Knoblecher ascended the mountain, which commanded a view\r\nof almost the entire Bari country. Toward the south-west the river wound\r\nout of sight between the mountains Rego and Kidi, near which is the\r\nmountain of Kereg, containing rich iron mines which are worked by the\r\nnatives; and to the south, on the very verge of the horizon, rose a long\r\nrange of hills, whose forms could not be observed with exactness, owing\r\nto the great distance. Beyond the Logwaya range, which appeared in the\r\neast, dwell the Berri tribes, whose language is distinct from the Baris,\r\nand who are neighbors of the Gallas, that warlike race, whose domain\r\nextends from Abyssinia to the wilds of Mozambique, along the great\r\ncentral plateau of Uniamesi. The natives of Logwek knew nothing whatever\r\nof the country to the south. The furthest mountain range was probably\r\nunder the parallel of latitude three degrees north, so that the White\r\nNile has now been traced nearly to the equator. At Logwek, it was about\r\nsix hundred and fifty feet wide, and from five to eight feet deep, at\r\nthe time of Dr. Knoblecher’s visit, which was during the dry season.\r\nSuch an abundance of water allows us to estimate with tolerable\r\ncertainty the distance to its unknown sources, which must undoubtedly\r\nlie beyond the equator. The great snow mountain of Kilimandjarò,\r\ndiscovered in 1850 by Dr. Krapf, the German missionary, on his journey\r\ninland from Mombas, on the coast of Zanzibar, has been located by\r\ngeographers in latitude three degrees south. It is therefore most\r\nprobable that the source of the White Nile will be found in the range of\r\nmountains, of which Kilimandjarò is the crowning apex. The geographer\r\nBerghaus, in a long and labored article, endeavors to prove that the\r\nGazelle river is the true Nile, and makes it rise in the great lake\r\nN’Yassi, in latitude thirteen degrees south. Dr. Knoblecher, however,\r\nwho examined the Bahr el-Ghazàl at its mouth, says it is an unimportant\r\nstream, with a scarcely perceptible current. He considers the White Nile\r\nas being, beyond all question, the true river.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE NILOMETER.]\r\n\r\nFollowing the river on to its mouth, the greater part of lower Egypt is\r\ncontained in a triangular island, formed by the Mediterranean sea, and\r\nthe two great branches of the Nile, which dividing itself five or six\r\nmiles from Old Cairo, flows on the one side to the north-east, falling\r\ninto the sea at Damietta; while the other branch runs to the north-west,\r\nand enters the sea at Rosetta. What is called the Delta, resembling the\r\nGreek letter of that name, and constituting a triangle, is thus formed.\r\nThe water of the Nile is here, for the most part, thick and muddy, more\r\nparticularly when the river is swollen by the heavy rains which\r\nconstantly fall within the tropics in the beginning of the summer\r\nseason, and which are doubtless the principal cause of its overflowing\r\nthe low lands of Egypt. A similar phenomenon is found in the Ganges; and\r\nit is the same with all the rivers which have either their rise or\r\ncourse within the tropics: they annually break their bounds, and cover\r\nthe lands for many miles on each side, before they reach the sea. They\r\nlikewise leave prolific mud, which, like that of the Nile, fertilizes\r\nthe land; beside which, the north winds prevailing about the latter end\r\nof May, drive in the waters from the sea, and keep back those of the\r\nriver, in such a manner as considerably to assist the swell. The\r\nEgyptians, and the Copts more especially, are persuaded that the Nile\r\nalways begins to rise on the same day of the year; as, indeed, it\r\ngenerally commences about the same time in June. Its rise was observed\r\nfor three successive years by Dr. Pococke, who found it to ascend during\r\nthe first five days from five to ten inches; and it thus continued\r\nrising till it had attained the hight of nine feet, when the canal of\r\nCairo was cut. It then rose from three to five inches only in the day;\r\nfor, having spread over the land and entered the canal, although more\r\nwater might have descended than before, its rise was less considerable.\r\nThe other canals were now laid open at stated times, and those which\r\nwater the lower grounds the last. These canals are carried along the\r\nhighest parts of the country, so that from their elevation the water may\r\nbe conveyed to the valleys. So important is this matter of the rise and\r\nfall of the river to the whole country, that a thin column or pillar,\r\ncalled the _Nilometer_, has been erected, to mark the elevation or\r\ndepression of its waters. A view of it is given in the cut following. It\r\nis situated in the middle of a round tower, on the island of Rhoda, not\r\nfar from Cairo, in the middle of the river. In this tower is a marble\r\ncistern, through which the Nile flows; its bottom and the bottom of the\r\nriver being on the same level. From the center of this cistern rises a\r\nslender pillar, as seen in the engraving, marked off into twenty\r\ndivisions of twenty inches each; the entire space marked on the column\r\nbeing somewhat more than thirty-six feet. This column is of the greatest\r\ninterest to the people, as connected with their prospects of a harvest;\r\nand of the greatest importance to the government, as enabling it to fix\r\nthe tribute, or tax, according to the hight of the inundation. The tower\r\nin which it is placed, is lighted by some eighteen or twenty windows,\r\nwhich form a belt around the base of the dome; and beneath these, and\r\nabove the cistern, are rooms or apartments for those who come to see the\r\nhight of the waters, from which rooms a flight of some thirty stone\r\nsteps leads to the marble pavement in the center of which the cistern\r\nand Nilometer are placed. As soon as the attendants ascertain that the\r\noverflow will be such as to fertilize all the land, the large canals are\r\nall opened with great ceremony and rejoicing. And as soon as the waters\r\nretire again from the fields, they are sown with all kinds of grain, so\r\nthat in a short space of time the whole face of the country is\r\nvariegated with the rich hues of the flowering plants and the ripening\r\ngrain.\r\n\r\nThe Nile has one peculiar characteristic. Other rivers being supplied by\r\nrivulets, the ground is lowest near their banks; but as no water flows\r\ninto the Nile in its passage throughout Egypt, and as it is necessary\r\nthat this river should overflow the land, the country is generally lower\r\nat a distance from, than near to it; and, in most parts, the land has a\r\ngradual descent from the river to the foot of the hills, which terminate\r\nthe sandy plains most benefited by the irrigation. Among other\r\nremarkable appearances, the celebrated Bruce notices a very singular one\r\nattendant on the inundation of the Nile. In Abyssinia, the early part of\r\nthe morning is constantly clear in that season, with a fine sunshine.\r\nAbout nine, a small cloud, not above four feet in apparent breadth,\r\nappears in the east, whirling violently round as if on an axis; but\r\nhaving approached nearly to the zenith, it first abates its motion, and\r\nthen loses its form, extending itself greatly, and seeming to call up\r\nvapors from all the opposite quarters. The clouds thus formed having\r\nattained nearly the same hight, rush against each other with great\r\nviolence, and remind the spectator of Elisha foretelling rain on Mount\r\nCarmel. The air being impelled before the heaviest mass, or swiftest\r\nmover, makes an impression of its form on the collection of clouds\r\nopposite; and the moment it has taken possession of the space made to\r\nreceive it, the most violent thunder possible to be conceived follows\r\ninstantly, attended by rain. After some hours the sky again clears, with\r\na wind at north; and it is always disagreeably cold when the thermometer\r\nis below sixty-three degrees.\r\n\r\nDr. Clarke, in his travels, draws the following elegant picture of this\r\nmost interesting river.\r\n\r\n“Here we were unexpectedly greeted with an astonishing view of the Nile,\r\nthe Delta, and the numerous groves in the neighborhood of Rosetta. The\r\nscene is beyond description. The sudden contrast it offers, opposed to\r\nthe desert we had traversed, the display of riches and abundance poured\r\nforth by the fertility of this African paradise, with all the local\r\ncircumstances of reflection excited by an extensive prospect of the\r\nNile, and of the plains of Egypt, render it one of the most interesting\r\nsights in the world. The beautiful boats of the Nile, with their large,\r\nwide-spreading sails, were passing up and down the river. Unable to quit\r\nthe spot, we dismissed our guides, and remained some time contemplating\r\nthe delightful picture. Afterward, descending on foot, close by the\r\nsuperb mosque of Abu-Mandur, we continued our walks along the bank of\r\nthe river, through gardens richer than imagination can portray, beneath\r\nthe shade of enormous overhanging branches of sycamore and fig trees,\r\namid bowers of roses, and through groves of date, citron, lime and\r\nbanana trees, to Rosetta.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                 THE BARRAGE, OR GREAT DAM OF THE NILE.\r\n\r\nWe end our sketches of Egypt, and the Nile, by a notice of the\r\n_barrage_, or great dam, at the northern part of the Delta, just below\r\nwhere the river divides into the two great streams which empty\r\nthemselves at Rosetta on the west, and Damietta on the east. This\r\nimmense work, which is hardly heard of out of Egypt, is one of the\r\ngreatest undertakings of modern times. It is nothing less than a damming\r\nof the Nile, so as to hold back its waters and keep them in reserve,\r\ntill, by letting them out, at the proper seasons, two inundations may be\r\nproduced each year, and so the crops doubled throughout the Delta. This\r\ngreat work is not only projected, but far advanced toward completion.\r\nEach branch of the river is to be spanned by sixty-two arches, besides a\r\ncentral gateway ninety feet in breadth, and flanked by lofty stone\r\ntowers. The point of the Delta, between the two dams, is protected by a\r\ncurtain of solid masonry, and the abutments which it joins are fortified\r\nby towers sixty or seventy feet in hight. The piers have curved\r\nbreakwaters on the upper side, while the opposite parapet of the arches\r\nrises high above them, so that the dam consists of three successive\r\nterraces, and presents itself like a wedge, against the force of such an\r\nimmense body of water. The material is brick, faced with stone. When\r\ncomplete, it is intended to close the side arches during low water,\r\nleaving only the central gateway open. By this means sufficient water\r\nwill be gained to fill all the irrigating canals, while a new channel,\r\ncut through the center of the Delta, will render productive a vast tract\r\nof fertile land. The project is a grand one, and the only obstacle to\r\nits success is the light, porous character of the alluvial soil on which\r\nthe piers are founded. The undertaking was planned and commenced by M.\r\nLinant, and has been continued by other engineers. “The Egyptian\r\nboatmen,” says Taylor, “have reason to complain of the _barrage_. The\r\nmain force of the river is poured through the narrow space wherein the\r\npiers have not yet been sunk, which can not be passed without a strong\r\nnorth wind. Forty or fifty boats were lying along the shore, waiting the\r\nfavorable moment. We obtained permission from the engineer to attach our\r\nboat to a large government barge, which was to be drawn up by a\r\nstationary windlass. As we put off, the wind freshened, and we were\r\nslowly urged against the current to the main rapid, and at last reached\r\nsmoother water, and sailed off gaily for Cairo.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                        THE AFRICAN BIRDS’ NEST.\r\n\r\nBefore passing to the ruins of some of the cities of antiquity, we would\r\nhere, by way of variety, briefly describe the wonderful and curious nest\r\nof the “_sociable weavers_,” as they are called, which abound in some\r\nparts of Africa; a view of which is given in the engraving below.\r\nHundreds of these birds, in one community, join to form a structure of\r\ninterwoven grass, containing various apartments, all covered by a\r\nsloping roof, which is extended, from year to year, as the increase of\r\ntheir numbers may require. A traveler, having examined one of these huge\r\nnests, found it to consist mainly of grass, without any mixture, but so\r\nfirmly basketed together as to be impenetrable to the rain, and\r\nextending like a canopy over all the particular nests built by the\r\nindividual birds. The one he examined contained no less than three\r\nhundred and twenty cells.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AFRICAN BIRDS’ NEST.]\r\n\r\nReturning from this digression, we now pass to the notice of some of the\r\nruins of the cities of antiquity; and first to the\r\n\r\n\r\n                           RUINS OF PALMYRA.\r\n\r\nThis noble city of ancient Syria, also called Tadmor, is of uncertain\r\ndate and origin, but is thought by some to have been the “Tadmor in the\r\nwilderness” built by Solomon. The first view of the city is exceedingly\r\nmagnificent, the snow-white appearance of the innumerable columns and\r\nbuildings, contrasting strikingly with the yellow sand of the desert.\r\nIts ruins are not to be compared, as to the size of the gates, columns\r\nand temples, with those of Balbec or Thebes; but they are more\r\nremarkable for their vast extent, and are less encumbered with modern\r\nfabrics than most ancient remains. They consist of temples, palaces,\r\ngateways and porticos of Grecian architecture, scattered over an extent\r\nof several miles. One of the most remarkable of them is the _temple of\r\nthe Sun_, the ruins of which extend over a square of more than two\r\nhundred yards. The temple itself, which points north and south, is\r\nthirty-three yards in length and about fourteen in width. At its center,\r\non the west side, is a magnificent entry, on the remains of which vines\r\nand clusters of grapes are carved in a bold and masterly imitation of\r\nnature. Over the door is a pair of wings, extending the whole breadth.\r\nIts north extremity is adorned with curious fret-work and bass-relief,\r\nand in the center is a dome, or cupola, about ten feet in diameter, of\r\nsolid stone. To the north of this is an obelisk of seven large stones,\r\nwhich probably once supported a statue; and about a quarter of a mile\r\ndistant are others similar to it, as if forming originally part of a\r\ncontinued row.\r\n\r\nAbout one hundred paces from the middle obelisk, straight forward, is a\r\nmagnificent entry to a piazza, forty feet in breadth and more than half\r\na mile in length, inclosed with two rows of marble pillars twenty-six\r\nfeet high, and eight or nine feet in compass. Of these there still\r\nremain one hundred and twenty-nine; and by a moderate computation, there\r\ncould not have been originally less than five hundred and sixty. At the\r\nwest side of this piazza are several apertures for gates into the court\r\nof the palace, each of them ornamented with four porphyry pillars, not\r\nstanding in a line with those of the wall, but placed by couples in the\r\nfront of the gate facing the palace, two on each side. Two of these only\r\nremain entire, and one only standing in its place. They are thirty feet\r\nin length, and nine in circumference. On the east side of the piazza\r\nstand a great number of marble pillars, some perfect, but the greater\r\npart mutilated. In one place eleven of them are ranged in a square, the\r\nspace they inclose being paved with broad flat stones, but without any\r\nremains of a roof. At a little distance are the remains of a small\r\ntemple, also without a roof, and having its walls much defaced. Before\r\nthe entry, which faces the south, is a piazza supported by six pillars,\r\ntwo on each side of the door, and one at each end. The pedestals of\r\nthose in front have been filled with inscriptions, both in the Greek and\r\nPalmyrene languages, which are become totally illegible. Among these\r\nruins are many sepulchers, ranged on each side of a hollow way toward\r\nthe north part of the city, and extending more than a mile; some being\r\nmere heaps of rubbish; others half fallen, exposing their shattered\r\nchambers; while one or two remain almost entire. They are built in the\r\nshape of square towers, from three to four stories in hight, each\r\nforming a sepulchral chamber, with recesses divided into compartments\r\nfor the reception of the bodies. Some of the chambers are beautifully\r\nornamented with Corinthian pilasters and sculptures, almost in perfect\r\npreservation, executed in bold relief; the walls are of white stucco,\r\nand the ceilings are divided into diamond-shaped compartments,\r\ndelicately ornamented with white stars on a blue ground; while over the\r\ndoorways are inscriptions both in the Greek and Palmyrene languages. The\r\noutsides are of common stone; but the floors and partitions of each\r\nstory are of marble. A walk crosses the center of this range of\r\nbuildings, and the space on each side is subdivided by thick walls, into\r\nsix partitions, the space between which is wide enough to receive the\r\nlargest corpse. In these niches six or seven are piled on one another.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            RUINS OF BALBEC.\r\n\r\nBaal-bec, or Balbec, is supposed by many to be the same as Baal-ath,\r\nbuilt by Solomon in Lebanon, as mentioned in the eighth chapter of the\r\nsecond book of Chronicles. Its magnificent ruins are described by Mr.\r\nBruce as even surpassing what he had seen at Palmyra. He was\r\nparticularly struck by the splendid vestiges of the great temple,\r\nsupposed to have been dedicated to the sun. The castle of Balbec, or\r\ntower of Lebanon, is described by Leander, a Carmelite monk, in his\r\ninteresting travels, as a surprising monument of antiquity, built\r\naccording to the tradition of the natives, by Solomon. His relation is\r\nas follows. “Balbec is distant from Damascus, toward the north, about\r\nfifty miles, and on the southern side is watered by springs and\r\nrivulets, brought thither, no doubt, to fill the ditches by which it was\r\nto have been surrounded for defense, but which were not completed. It is\r\nsituated on the lofty summit of a hill, in approaching which the façade\r\nof the castle is seen, having two towers at its right angles, between\r\nwhich is a great portico, resembling the mouth of a vast cave, and\r\nprovided with very strong walls. That on the right hand, by which the\r\nportico is attached to the tower, from the west to the north, is\r\ncomposed of four stones only, the fifth, which was to have completed the\r\nfabric, being deficient. The length of each of these stones is not less\r\nthan sixty-two feet, and their breadth and hight thirteen. They are so\r\nartfully brought together, without any cement, that they appear to be\r\nonly one solid block. The remainder of the wall to the left is of hewn\r\nstones, well cemented with quick-lime, the smallest of which are six\r\nfeet in length, and four feet and six inches in hight: there are many\r\nwhich are upward of fifteen feet in length, but the hight of all of them\r\nis the same.\r\n\r\n“Having entered the cavern by the grand portico, the traveler proceeds\r\nin obscurity to the distance of eighteen paces, when he at length\r\nperceives a ray of light proceeding from the aperture of the door which\r\nconducts to the center. At each of the sides, and within this grand\r\nportico, is a flight of stone steps which leads to the subterraneous\r\nprisons. Their aspect is horrid, and they were formerly dangerous, being\r\nfrequented by banditti and robbers, who would plunder, kill, and here\r\nbury such wretched travelers as were imprudently led by their curiosity\r\nto penetrate, and risk the descent without being well escorted.\r\nFollowing the road above, by the cavern, to the extent of fifty paces,\r\nan ample area of a spherical figure presents itself, surrounded by\r\nmajestic columns of granite, some of them of a single piece, and others\r\nformed of two pieces, the whole of them of so large a dimension, that\r\ntwo men can with difficulty girt them. They are of the Ionic order of\r\narchitecture, and are placed on bases of the same stone, at such\r\ndistances from each other that a coach and six might commodiously turn\r\nbetween them. They support a flat tower or roof, from which projects a\r\ncornice wrought with figures of matchless workmanship: these rise above\r\nthe capitals with so nice an union, that the eye can not distinguish the\r\nplace where they are joined. At the present time the greater part of\r\nthis colonnade is destroyed, the western part alone remaining perfect\r\nand upright. This fabric has an elevation of five hundred feet, and is\r\nfour hundred feet in length. In its exterior, and behind, it is flanked\r\nby two other towers similar to those of the first façade, the whole\r\nprojecting from the wall, which within is provided with loop-holes, to\r\nkeep off the enemy, in case of necessity, by the means of stones, fire,\r\n&c. It also surrounds the colonnade, more particularly in the part which\r\nlooks toward the east. At the left flank rises a temple, which tradition\r\nsays was the hall of audience of Solomon, in hight at least eighty feet,\r\nand long and large in proportion. Its stones are all sculptured with\r\nbass-reliefs, similar to those which ornament Trajan’s column at Rome,\r\nrepresenting many triumphs and naval engagements. Several of these\r\nbass-reliefs have been defaced by the Saracens, who are the decided\r\nenemies of all sculptures. Without this grand hall is an avenue of the\r\nsame size and breadth, where the traveler admires a large portal\r\nconstructed with three stones only, attached to which, in the middle\r\npart, serving as an architrave, is seen, in a garland of laurel\r\ninterwoven with flowers, a large eagle admirably sculptured in\r\nbass-relief. At the sides of the portal are placed two columns, in one\r\nof which, although formed of a single stone, is a winding staircase by\r\nwhich to ascend to the architrave: the passage is however very narrow.\r\nThere is in the vicinity another temple, of an octangular shape, with a\r\nportico of superb architecture, and having three windows on the side\r\nopposite to the former.”\r\n\r\nThree times Leander returned to visit this splendid vestige of\r\nantiquity; and on the last of these occasions, being well escorted, he\r\nproceeded to the distance of about a mile, to the foot of the mountains\r\nof Damascus, whence the stones employed in its construction were\r\nbrought. He measured the stone which remained there, and which has\r\nalready been noticed as having been intended for the fifth in the\r\nconstruction of the wall: it had been hewn out on all sides, was lying\r\non the ground, and was simply attached to the rock at the lower part.\r\nIts length and dimensions were such that he could not conceive how it\r\nwould have been possible to detach it, and still less with what machines\r\nto move, transport, and raise it to the hight at which other stones are\r\nplaced, more especially as the sites, the roads, and the masses of rock\r\nare such, as to exceed in roughness and difficulty whatever the\r\nimagination can picture to itself. In the vicinity of the cave whence\r\nthe stones were drawn is a very beautiful sepulcher supported by columns\r\nof porphyry, over which is a dome of the finest symmetry, and of great\r\nbeauty.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           RUINS OF BABYLON.\r\n\r\nThe ruins of Babylon are deeply interesting, not only on account of\r\ntheir great antiquity, but from the associations connected with them.\r\nThey have been visited and described by Mr. Rich, resident for the East\r\nIndia company at Bagdad; and the result of his researches is given by\r\nthe Rev. Mr. Maurice, author of “Indian Antiquities,” and assistant\r\nlibrarian to the British museum, in his elaborate work entitled\r\n“Observations connected with Astronomy and Ancient History, Sacred and\r\nProfane, on the Ruins of Babylon.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TOWER NEAR BABYLON.]\r\n\r\nBabylon was situated in a plain of vast extent, and bisected by the\r\nnoble river Euphrates. Over this river was thrown a bridge of massive\r\nmasonry, strongly compacted with iron and lead, by which the two sides\r\nof the city were connected; and the embankments on each side, to\r\nrestrain its current, were lofty, and formed of the same durable\r\nmaterials as the walls of the city. The city itself is represented by\r\nHerodotus to have been a perfect square, inclosed by a wall in\r\ncircumference four hundred and eighty furlongs. It is stated to have\r\nabounded in houses three or four stories in hight, and to have been\r\nregularly divided into streets, running parallel to each other, with\r\ntranverse avenues occasionally opening to the river. It was surrounded\r\nwith a wide and deep trench, the earth dug out of which was formed into\r\nsquare bricks and baked in a furnace. With these, cemented together with\r\nheated bitumen, intermixed with reeds to bind the viscid mass, the sides\r\nof the trenches were lined; and of the same solid materials the walls of\r\nthe vast dimensions above described were formed. At certain regular\r\ndistances on them, watch-towers were erected; and below they were\r\ndivided and adorned with a hundred immense gates of brass. As you float\r\ndown the river from Bagdad, you pass a plain that hears the name of\r\nDura, which tradition says, is the very place where Nebuchadnezzar set\r\nup the golden image, and commanded all to bow down and worship it: it is\r\nnow a wilderness, with here and there a shapeless mound, the remains of\r\nsome ancient habitation. And still further down, as you approach the\r\ncity, is a tower, some two hundred feet high, on the east bank of the\r\nriver, with an ascending way winding round it on the outside, like the\r\nspiral of a screw, as seen in the cut below, reminding the traveler of\r\nthe common ideal pictures of the tower of Babel. It marks the site of\r\nthe ancient city of Samarrah, where the Roman army under Jovian rested\r\nafter marching and fighting a long summer’s day. It was afterward the\r\ncapital of the eighth caliph of the Abbasside dynasty.\r\n\r\nIn the center of each of the grand divisions of the city itself, a\r\nstupendous public fabric was erected. In one (the eastern side) stood\r\nthe temple of Belus, and in the other, (or western division,) in a large\r\nor strongly fortified inclosure, the royal palace, intended, doubtless,\r\nfor defense as well as for ornament. The temple of Belus was a square\r\npile, on each side of the extent of two furlongs. The tower erected in\r\nits center was a furlong in breadth, and as much in hight, the latter of\r\nwhich (taking the furlong at only five hundred feet) is enormous, being\r\nhigher, by twenty feet, than the great pyramid of Memphis. On this\r\ntower, as a base, seven other lofty towers were erected in regular\r\nsuccession; and the whole was crowned, we are told by Diodorus, with a\r\nbrazen statue of Belus, forty feet high! The palace, intended also as a\r\ncitadel, was erected on an area a mile and a half square, and was\r\nsurrounded with three vast circular walls, which, as we are informed by\r\nDiodorus Siculus, were ornamented with sculptured animals resembling\r\nlife, richly painted in their natural colors on the bricks of which they\r\nwere composed, and afterward burnt in. This may be mentioned as nearly\r\nthe earliest specimen of enameling on record. Indeed, it was scarcely\r\npossible for a nation, who were so well practiced in the burning of\r\nbricks even to a vitreous hardness, to have been ignorant of this fine\r\nart; and that they could also engrave upon them, is evident, as we may\r\nsoon see, from the characters at this day sculptured upon those that\r\nhave been dug up and brought to Europe, many of which are preserved in\r\nthe British museum. On the far-famed hanging gardens, and the\r\nsubterraneous vault or tunnel constructed by Semiramis, or Nitocris, or\r\nthe founder of Babylon, whoever he was, there is no necessity to dilate,\r\nas every trace of them, except what the idle fancy of travelers has\r\nsurmised, must long since have disappeared; but such, in its general\r\noutline, was the _mighty Babylon_—BABYLON THE GREAT.\r\n\r\nMr. Rich, whose residence at the court of Bagdad, with the powerful\r\nprotection of the pacha, afforded him every facility for comprehensive\r\ninvestigation, describes the whole country between Bagdad and Hella, a\r\ndistance of forty-eight miles, as a perfectly flat, and, for the greater\r\npart, uncultivated waste; though it is evident, from the number of\r\ncanals by which it is traversed, and the immense ruins that cover its\r\nsurface, that it must formerly have been both well peopled and\r\ncultivated. About two miles above Hella, the more prominent ruins\r\ncommence, among which, at intervals, are discovered, in considerable\r\nquantities, burnt and unburnt bricks and bitumen: two vast mounds in\r\nparticular attract attention from their size, and these are situated on\r\nthe eastern bank of the Euphrates. At the time of his visit, there were\r\nscarcely any remains of ruins visible, immediately opposite on the\r\nwestern bank, but there were some of stupendous magnitude on that side,\r\nabout six miles to the south-west of Hella.\r\n\r\nThe first grand mass of ruins described by Mr. Rich, extends one\r\nthousand one hundred yards in length, and eight hundred in its greatest\r\nbreadth, its figure nearly resembling that of a quadrant; its hight is\r\nirregular; but the most elevated part may be about fifty or sixty feet\r\nabove the level of the plain, and it has been dug into for the purpose\r\nof procuring bricks. On the north is a valley of five hundred and fifty\r\nyards in length, the area of which is covered with tussocks of rank\r\ngrass, and crossed by a line of ruins of very little elevation. To this\r\nsucceeds the second grand heap of ruins, the shape of which is nearly a\r\nsquare, seven hundred yards in length and breadth, and having its\r\nsouth-west angle connected with the north-west angle of the mounds of\r\nAmran, by a ridge of considerable hight, and nearly one hundred yards in\r\nbreadth. This he thought the most interesting part of the ruins of\r\nBabylon; every vestige discoverable in it declaring it to have been\r\ncomposed of buildings far superior to all the rest which had left traces\r\nin the eastern quarter: the bricks were of the finest description; and,\r\nnotwithstanding this was the grand storehouse of them, and that the\r\ngreatest supplies had been and then were constantly drawn from it, they\r\nappeared still to be abundant. But the operation of extracting the\r\nbricks had caused great confusion, and contributed much to increase the\r\ndifficulty of deciphering the original design of this mound, as, in\r\nsearch of them, the workmen had pierced into it in every direction,\r\nhollowing out deep ravines and pits, and throwing up the rubbish in\r\nheaps on the surface. In some places they had bored into the solid mass,\r\nforming winding caverns and subterraneous passages, which, from their\r\nbeing left without adequate support, sometimes fell and buried the\r\nworkmen in the rubbish. In all these excavations, walls of burnt brick,\r\nlaid in lime mortar of a very good quality, are seen; and, in addition\r\nto the substances generally strewed on the surfaces of all these mounds,\r\nhere are found fragments of alabaster vessels, fine earthenware, marble,\r\nand great quantities of varnished tiles, the glazing and coloring of\r\nwhich are surprisingly fresh. In a hollow near the southern part, Mr.\r\nRich found a sepulchral urn of earthenware, which had been broken in\r\ndigging, and near it lay some human bones, which pulverized with the\r\ntouch.\r\n\r\n“Not more than two hundred yards,” he says, “from the northern extremity\r\nof the above mound is a ravine hollowed out by those who dig for bricks,\r\nin length nearly a hundred yards, and thirty feet wide, by forty or\r\nfifty deep. On one side of it, a few yards of wall remain standing, the\r\nface of which is very clean and perfect, and which appears to have been\r\nthe front of some building. The opposite side is so confused a mass of\r\nrubbish, that it would seem as if the ravine had been worked through a\r\nsolid building. Under the foundations at the southern end an opening is\r\nmade, which discovers a subterraneous passage seven feet in hight, and\r\nwinding to the south, floored and walled with large brick, laid in\r\nbitumen and covered over with pieces of sandstone, a yard thick, and\r\nseveral yards long, on which the whole pressure is so great as to have\r\ngiven a considerable degree of obliquity to the side walls of the\r\npassage. The superstructure is cemented with bitumen, other parts of the\r\nravine with mortar, and the bricks all have writing on them. The\r\nnorthern end of the ravine appears to have been crossed by an extremely\r\nthick wall of yellowish brick, cemented with a brilliant white mortar,\r\nwhich has been broken through in hollowing it out; and a little to the\r\nnorth is sculptured a lion of colossal dimensions, standing on a\r\npedestal, of a coarse kind of gray granite, and of rude workmanship; in\r\nthe mouth is a circular aperture, into which a man may introduce his\r\nfist.”\r\n\r\nThe next considerable mass to that of Amran is the Kasr, or palace, as\r\nit is called by the natives, and it is thus described by Mr. Rich.\r\n\r\n“It is a very remarkable ruin, which, being uncovered, and in part\r\ndetached from the rubbish, is visible from a considerable distance, but\r\nso surprisingly fresh in its appearance, that it was only after a minute\r\ninspection I was satisfied of its being in reality a Babylonian remain.\r\nIt consists of several walls and piers, (which face the cardinal\r\npoints,) eight feet in thickness, in some places ornamented with niches,\r\nand in others, strengthened by pilasters and buttresses, built of fine\r\nburnt brick, (still perfectly clean and sharp,) laid in lime cement, of\r\nsuch tenacity, that those whose business it is have given up working, on\r\naccount of the extreme difficulty of extracting them whole. The tops of\r\nthese walls are broken, and may have been much higher. On the outside,\r\nthey have in some places been cleared nearly to the foundations; but the\r\ninternal spaces, formed by them, are yet filled with rubbish, in some\r\nparts almost to their summit. One part of the wall has been split into\r\nthree parts, and overthrown, as if by an earthquake; some detached walls\r\nof the same kind, standing at different distances, show what remains to\r\nhave been only a small part of the original fabric; indeed, it appears\r\nthat the passage in the ravine, together with the wall which crosses its\r\nupper end, were connected with it. There are some hollows underneath, in\r\nwhich several persons have lost their lives; so that no one will now\r\nventure into them, and their entrances have become choked up with\r\nrubbish. Near this ruin is a heap of rubbish, the sides of which are\r\ncuriously streaked by the alternation of its materials, the chief part\r\nof which, it is probable, was unburnt brick, of which I found a small\r\nquantity in the neighborhood; but no reeds were discoverable in the\r\ninterstices.\r\n\r\n“A mile to the north of the Kasr, or full five miles distant from Hella,\r\nand nine hundred and fifty yards from the river bank, is the last ruin\r\nof this series, which has been described by Pietro Della Valle, who\r\ndetermines it to have been the tower of Belus, an opinion adopted by\r\nRennel. The natives call it Mukallibe, or, according to the vulgar Arab\r\npronunciation of these parts, Mujelibe, meaning _overturned_; they\r\nsometimes also apply this term to the mounds of the Kasr. It is of an\r\noblong shape, irregular in its hight and the measurement of its sides,\r\nwhich face the cardinal points; the northern side being two hundred\r\nyards in length, the southern two hundred and nineteen, the eastern one\r\nhundred and eighty-two, and the western one hundred and thirty-six; the\r\nelevation of the south-east, or highest angle, one hundred and forty-one\r\nfeet. The western face, which is the least elevated, is the most\r\ninteresting, on account of the appearance of building it presents. Near\r\nthe summit of it appears a low wall, with interruptions, built of\r\nunburnt bricks, mixed up with chopped straw or reeds, and cemented with\r\nclay-mortar of great thickness, having between every layer a layer of\r\nreeds; and on the north side are, also, some vestiges of a similar\r\nconstruction. The south-west angle is crowned by something like a\r\nturret, or lantern: the other angles are in a less perfect state, but\r\nmay originally have been ornamented in a similar manner. The western\r\nface is lowest and easiest of ascent, the northern the most difficult.\r\nAll are worn into furrows by the weather; and in some places, where\r\nseveral channels of rain have united together, these furrows are of\r\ngreat depth, and penetrate a considerable way into the mound. The summit\r\nis covered with heaps of rubbish, in digging into some of which, layers\r\nof broken burnt brick, cemented with mortar, are discovered, and whole\r\nbricks, with inscriptions on them, are here and there found. The whole\r\nis covered with innumerable fragments of pottery, brick, bitumen,\r\npebbles, vitrified brick, or scoria, and even shells, bits of glass, and\r\nmother of pearl.”\r\n\r\nMr. Rich, having now finished his observations on the ruins of the east\r\nbank of the Euphrates, enters upon the examination of what, on the\r\nopposite west bank, have been by some travelers supposed (and their\r\nsuppositions have been adopted by Major Rennel) to be the remains of\r\nthis great city. Those, however, which Mr. Rich describes, are of the\r\nmost trifling kind, scarcely exceeding one hundred yards in extent, and\r\nwholly consisting of two or three insignificant mounds of earth,\r\novergrown with rank grass. The country, too, being marshy, he doubts the\r\npossibility of there having been any buildings of considerable magnitude\r\nerected in that spot, and, much less, buildings of the astonishing\r\ndimensions of those described by the classical writers of antiquity. He\r\nthen opens to our view a new and almost unexplored remain of ancient\r\ngrandeur, in the following passage.\r\n\r\n“But, although there are not any ruins in the immediate vicinity of the\r\nriver, by far the most stupendous and surprising mass of all the remains\r\nof Babylon is situated in the desert about six miles to the south-west\r\nof Hella. It is called by the Arabs _Birs Nimrod_, by the Jews,\r\nNebuchadnezzar’s prison. It is a mound of an oblong figure, the total\r\ncircumference of which is seven hundred and sixty-two yards. At the\r\neastern side it is cloven by a deep furrow, and is not more than fifty\r\nor sixty feet high; but at the western it rises in a conical figure to\r\nthe elevation of one hundred and ninety-eight feet; and on its summit is\r\na solid pile of brick, thirty-seven feet high by twenty-eight in\r\nbreadth, diminishing in thickness to the top, which is broken and\r\nirregular, and rent by a large fissure extending through a third of its\r\nhight. It is perforated by small square holes, disposed in rhomboids.\r\nThe fine burnt bricks of which it is built have inscriptions on them;\r\nand so admirable is the cement, which appears to be lime-mortar, that,\r\nthough the layers are so close together that it is difficult to discern\r\nwhat substance is between them, it is nearly impossible to extract one\r\nof the bricks whole. The other parts of the summit of this hill are\r\noccupied by immense fragments of brick-work, of no determinate figure,\r\ntumbled together and converted into solid vitrified masses, as if they\r\nhad undergone the action of the fiercest fire, or been blown up with\r\ngunpowder, the layers of the bricks being perfectly discernible; a\r\ncurious fact, and one for which I am utterly incapable of accounting.\r\nRound the Birs are traces of ruins to a considerable extent. To the\r\nnorth is the canal which supplies Mesjiid Ali with water, which was dug\r\nat the expense of the Nuwaub Shujahed Doulah, and called after his\r\ncountry, Hindia. We are informed that, from the summit of the Birs, in a\r\nclear morning, the gilt dome of Mesjiid Ali may be seen.”\r\n\r\nBefore passing on to a brief notice of the later discoveries at Babylon,\r\na word may be said on the subject of the\r\n\r\n\r\n                           BABYLONIAN BRICKS.\r\n\r\nOne of the ancient methods of writing, was on stone or brick, of which,\r\nas the earliest example on record, if allowable to be cited, may be\r\nadduced that of the two pillars of Seth, the one of brick and the other\r\nof stone, said by Josephus to have been erected before the deluge, and\r\nto have contained the history of antediluvian arts and sciences. However\r\ndisputable this account may be, that of the tables of stone on which the\r\ndecalogue was written by the finger of the Deity, and delivered to Moses\r\non Mount Sinai, can admit of no doubt, no more than can the hieroglyphic\r\ncharacters in the most ancient periods, engraved on the marbles of\r\nEgypt, at present so abundant in the collections of Europe, and which\r\nremain to this day, and will be, for centuries to come, a lasting proof\r\nof the high advance in the engraving art, as well as in chemical\r\nscience, of a nation, who, at that early period, could fabricate\r\ninstruments to cut them so deep and indelibly on the almost impenetrable\r\ngranite.\r\n\r\nIn countries destitute of stone, like Chaldea, an artificial substance,\r\nclay, intermixed with reeds, and indurated by fire, was made use of for\r\nthat purpose. Of this substance, formed into square masses, covered with\r\nmystic characters, the walls and palaces of Babylon were, for the most\r\npart, constructed: and it has been seen in the accounts of travelers who\r\nhave visited these ruins, examined the bricks, and observed those reeds\r\nintermingled with their substance, how durable, through a vast\r\nsuccession of ages, those bricks, with their inscribed characters, have\r\nremained. Their real meaning, or that of the Persepolitan arrow-headed\r\nobelistical characters, and the still more complicated hieroglyphics of\r\nEgypt, however partially deciphered by the labors of the learned, will,\r\nperhaps, never be fathomed in its full extent, by the utmost ingenuity\r\nof man.\r\n\r\nOf the bitumen with which these Babylonian bricks were cemented\r\ntogether, and which was plentifully produced in the neighborhood of\r\nBabylon, it may be proper in this place to remark, that it binds\r\nstronger than mortar, and in time becomes harder than the brick itself.\r\nIt was also impenetrable to water, as was formerly well known, for both\r\nthe outside and the inside of the ark was incrusted with it. Gen. vi.\r\n14. It may be proper to add here, that the bitumen, to deprive it of its\r\nbrittleness, and render it capable of being applied to the brick, must\r\nbe boiled with a certain proportion of oil, and that it retains its\r\ntenacity longest in a humid situation. Mr. Rich informs us, that it is\r\n“at present principally used for calking boats, coating cisterns, baths,\r\nand other places which usually come in contact with water. The fragments\r\nof it scattered over the ruins of Babylon are black, shining and\r\nbrittle, somewhat resembling pit-coal in substance and appearance.” It\r\nwill not be forgotten, that the custom above alluded to, of mixing straw\r\nor reeds with bricks baked in the sun, in order to bind them closer, and\r\nso make them more firm and compact, was also used in Egypt, as may be\r\ninferred from Exodus v. 7, where Pharaoh commands the taskmasters of the\r\noppressed Israelites “not to give them straw to make bricks,” in order\r\nto multiply their vexations and increase their toil.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the Babylonian bricks, and their variety in respect to size,\r\ncolor, hardness, &c., Mr. Rich tells us, that the general size of the\r\nkiln-burnt brick is thirteen inches square, by three thick; and that\r\nsome are of about half these dimensions, and a few of different shapes\r\nfor particular purposes, such as rounding corners, &c. They are of\r\ndifferent colors: _white_, with a yellowish tinge, like what are called\r\nfire-brick; _red_, like our ordinary brick, which are the coarsest of\r\nall; and some _blackish_, and very hard. The sun-dried brick are\r\ngenerally the largest, and more or less mixed with chopped straw, for\r\nthe obvious purpose of binding them; and some even of the fire-burnt\r\nbricks seem to have been made of the same material. In the palace, or\r\nKasr, Mr. Rich found far finer specimens of art than the mere brick-work\r\naffords; for in addition to the substances usually strewed on the\r\nsurfaces of all these mounds, he saw fragments of alabaster vessels,\r\nfine earthen-ware, marble, and great quantities of varnished tiles, the\r\nglazing and coloring of which was surprisingly fresh. The process from\r\nmaking pottery to molding figures in clay, was not difficult; but the\r\ndesigns in brass, and the grouping of figures, must have required much\r\ngreater skill and labor.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     LATER DISCOVERIES AT BABYLON.\r\n\r\nAs the traveler approaches very near to Babylon, from the north, the\r\nfirst great ruin, as we have already said, is the “mound of Babel,”\r\nbetter known as the Mujelibé, or the “overturned,” a vast mound, from\r\nthe top of which rises a solitary mass of brick-work, and beyond which\r\nare long undulating heaps of earth, bricks and pottery. On all sides are\r\nfragments of glass, marble, earthen-ware, and inscribed brick, mingled\r\nwith that peculiar nitrous and blanched soil, which, bred from the\r\nremains of ancient habitations, checks or destroys vegetation, and\r\nrenders the site of Babylon a naked and hideous waste, fit only for the\r\nabode of owls and jackals. Southward from this spot, for nearly three\r\nmiles, there is an almost uninterrupted line of mounds, the ruins of the\r\nvast edifices which once formed part of the city. Mr. Layard commenced\r\nhis excavations in one of these mounds, finding arrow-heads of iron and\r\nbronze, glass bottles, colored and ribbed, and of various forms and\r\nsizes, &c., &c., &c. On going deeper, the workmen soon reached solid\r\npiers and walls of brick masonry, many of the bricks bearing the usual\r\nsuperscription of Nebuchadnezzar; and the remains of similar buildings\r\nwere found in various places. But though Mr. Layard’s discoveries of\r\nthis kind were numerous, few things were brought to light materially\r\ndifferent from what had been found and described by others before him.\r\n\r\nAbout the year 1850, however, the French government sent out three\r\ngentlemen to make scientific and artistic researches in Media,\r\nMesopotamia, and Babylon. One, M. Jules Oppert, has just returned to\r\nParis, (1854,) and it appears, from his report, that he and his\r\ncolleagues thought it advisable to begin by confining themselves to the\r\nexploration of ancient Babylon. This task was one of immense difficulty,\r\nand it was enhanced by the excessive heat of the sun, by privations of\r\nall kinds, and by the incessant hostility of the Arabs. After a while M.\r\nOppert’s two colleagues fell ill, so that all the labors of the\r\nexpedition devolved on him. He first of all made excavations of the\r\nruins of the famous suspended gardens of Babylon, which are now known by\r\nthe name of the hall of Amran-ibn-Ali; and obtained in them a number of\r\ncurious architectural and other objects, which are destined to be placed\r\nin the Louvre at Paris. He next, in obedience to the special orders of\r\nhis government, took measures for ascertaining the precise extent of\r\nBabylon, a matter which the reader is aware has always been open to\r\ncontroversy. He has succeeded in making a series of minute surveys, and\r\nin drawing up detailed plans of the immense city. His opinion is, that\r\neven the largest calculations as to its vast extent are not exaggerated;\r\nand he puts down that extent at the astounding figure of five hundred\r\nsquare kilometres, French measure, (the square kilometre is eleven\r\nhundred and ninety-six square yards.) This is very nearly eighteen times\r\nthe size of Paris. But, of course, he does not say that this enormous\r\narea was occupied, or anything like it: it comprised within the walls\r\nhuge tracts of cultivated lands and gardens, for supplying the\r\npopulation with food in the event of a siege. M. Oppert has discovered\r\nthe Babylonian and Assyrian measures, and by means of them has\r\nascertained exactly what part of the city was inhabited, and what part\r\nwas in fields and gardens. On the limits of the town, properly so\r\ncalled, stands at present the flourishing town of Hillah. This town,\r\nsituated on the banks of the Euphrates, is built with bricks from the\r\nruins, and many of the household utensils, and personal ornaments of its\r\ninhabitants, are taken from them also. Beyond this town is the vast\r\nfortress, strengthened by Nebuchadnezzar, and in the midst of it is the\r\nroyal palace, itself almost as large as a town. M. Oppert says, that he\r\nwas also able to distinguish the ruins of the famous tower of Babel;\r\nthey are most imposing, and stand on a site formerly called Borsippa, or\r\nthe tower of languages. The royal town, situated on the two banks of the\r\nEuphrates, covers a space of nearly seven square kilometres, and\r\ncontains most interesting ruins. Amongst them are those of the royal\r\npalace, the fortress, and the suspended gardens. In the collection of\r\ncuriosities which M. Oppert has brought away with him, is a vase, which\r\nhe declares to date from the time of one of the Chaldean sovereigns\r\nnamed Narambel, that is, somewhere about sixteen hundred years before\r\nChrist; also a number of copies of cuneiform inscriptions which he has\r\nevery reason to believe that he will be able to decipher. It may not be\r\nout of place, to add, here, that in the excavations recently made in\r\nPersia, it is said that the palace of Shushan and the tomb of Daniel\r\nhave probably been found; and also the very pavement described in Esther\r\ni. 6, “of red, and blue, and white, and black marble.” On the tomb is\r\nthe sculptured figure of a man bound hand and foot, with a huge lion in\r\nthe act of springing upon him to devour him. No history could speak more\r\ngraphically the story of Daniel in the lion’s den. Various other\r\ndiscoveries have also been made, all of which bear out the statements of\r\nthe Old Testament history as to the times of the prophet, and the nation\r\nof which he speaks.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           RUINS OF NINEVEH.\r\n\r\nNineveh, famous in the ancient world, as the splendid capital of the\r\nAssyrian empire, had been hidden some two thousand years in its unknown\r\ngrave, when a French _savant_ and a wandering English scholar sought out\r\nthe seat of that once mighty power, and throwing off its shroud of sand\r\nand ruin, revealed to the astonished world its temples, palaces, and\r\nidols, the representations of the wars of the ancient Assyrians, and\r\ntheir triumphs in civilization and art. Niebuhr was one of the first to\r\ngive attention to these ruins, and especially to stimulate the curiosity\r\nand enterprise of others. And after him Rich, Botta, and others, and\r\nespecially and above all, Layard, carried on investigations which have\r\nbrought to light the wonderful remains of this long-buried city. The\r\nearliest successful excavations were made by Botta at Khorsabad, in\r\n1843; and by these he was led on to the discovery of an immense monument\r\nworthy to be compared in richness and ornament to the most sumptuous\r\nproductions bequeathed us by ancient Egypt. The first discovery was of\r\nthe remains of a chamber, which evidently was but part of a large\r\nbuilding buried in the mound, the walls of which were covered with\r\nbass-reliefs. And next, finding a bronze lion, and the heads and wings\r\nof the winged bulls, M. Botta was satisfied that the whole space was\r\nfull of ancient remains. After various difficulties and obstacles, which\r\nwere at length overcome, in 1844, he had three hundred laborers at work\r\nmaking excavations, while an artist copied the bass-reliefs and\r\ninscriptions as fast as they were uncovered. These, with the most\r\nremarkable and best preserved pieces of sculpture, were sent to Paris,\r\nwhere they arrived in 1846, and where they now form one of the greatest\r\nattractions in the noble museum of the Louvre.\r\n\r\nThe last and most important, however, of the laborers in the field of\r\nAssyrian antiquities, is Austen Henry Layard, who visited this region in\r\n1840, and again in 1842. In 1845, under the patronage, and through the\r\nassistance of Sir Stratford Canning, he again went to Assyria, and\r\ncommencing his excavations, first discovered the long wished for\r\nbass-reliefs on the twenty-eighth of November. Soon afterward he dug up\r\na gigantic human head, much to the terror of the Arabs, who believed it\r\nto be the head of Nimrod himself. Next, he came upon a rich collection\r\nof sculptures, in an excellent state of preservation, among which were\r\nkings, priests, griffins, eunuchs, symbolic trees, &c., &c. Another\r\ndiscovery was that of a vaulted chamber, in the center of a wall some\r\nfifty feet thick, and fifteen feet below the surface of the mound, the\r\ntop of which was as regularly arched as any modern room could be.\r\nTubular drain-tiles for carrying off the water that fell from the roofs\r\nof buildings, and thin layers of bitumen under the floors and slabs, to\r\nkeep them from the dampness of the ground beneath, were also discovered\r\nin various places. The gigantic lions which M. Botta had seen, were also\r\nexamined by Mr. Layard; and new chambers, covered with bass-reliefs of\r\nbattles, sieges, victories, triumphs, banquetings, sacrifices, &c., were\r\nexplored. A large obelisk of black marble was shipped for England; and\r\nfrom some twenty chambers explored within about four months, numerous\r\narticles were gathered and sent forward to the same country.\r\n\r\nAs a specimen of the wonderful sculptures brought to light by the\r\nindefatigable labors of Layard, we may mention the _colossal winged\r\nbull_, represented in the cut on page 584. The features of the face, the\r\ncap on the head, and the arrangement of the hair and beard, are Persian.\r\nThe wings extend over the back. The figure is supposed to represent one\r\nof the Assyrian deities, as the attributes of intelligence, strength,\r\nand swiftness, are typified by the head of a man, the body of a bull,\r\nand the wings of an eagle. Somewhat similar to this was another large\r\nsculpture of a _colossal winged lion_, on a slab nine feet square. The\r\ncountenance of this figure is noble and benevolent in expression; the\r\nfeatures being of a true Persian type. It wears an egg-shaped cap, with\r\na cord round the base of it. The hair at the back of the head has seven\r\nranges of curls; the beard being divided into three ranges of curls,\r\nwith intervals of wavy hair. The elaborately sculptured wings extend\r\nover the back of the animal to the very verge of the slab. All the flat\r\nsurface is covered with what is termed a cuneiform inscription. Round\r\nthe loins is a succession of numerous cords, which are drawn into four\r\nseparate knots; at the extremities are fringes, forming as many distinct\r\ntassels. The strength of the lion is admirably delineated in the\r\nsculpture, showing that the artist had a complete acquaintance with the\r\ndetails of its figure and anatomy. Both these huge sculptures were sent\r\nto England, though only with immense labor and expense; and they are now\r\nin the British museum.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COLOSSAL WINGED BULL FROM NINEVEH.]\r\n\r\nIn the brief space which can be allotted to the ruins of Nineveh, it\r\nwould be impossible to give more than a glance at all the wonderful\r\ndiscoveries made there. A mere outline is all that will be attempted,\r\nwhile for the complete description, the reader is referred to the\r\npublished volumes of Layard himself. The platform of Khorsabad, for\r\nexample, was in somewhat the shape of the letter T; and the latter, or\r\nsouth-eastern end of this was nine hundred and seventy-five feet wide,\r\nby four hundred and twenty deep; and here some of the principal\r\nmonuments were found. The great portal to the building, forming the\r\ncenter of the façade, consisted, on each side, of three colossal bulls,\r\nwith human heads and eagles’ wings, and a gigantic figure of a man, each\r\nformed of a single block of alabaster. Passing through this gateway, we\r\ncome to a court three hundred and forty by one hundred and fifty-seven\r\nfeet, the entrance of which is guarded by symbolic figures which are\r\ncombinations of the man, the bull, and the eagle, bearing a general\r\nresemblance to those spoken of above. Near by is a gigantic figure,\r\nsupposed to be intended for Nimrod himself; and also another of a winged\r\nman, or divinity, with four wings, offering a pine cone with one hand,\r\nand holding a basket in the other. In the different chambers, are\r\nbass-reliefs of the great king and his officers, in their various\r\nappropriate dresses; the sword, the sandals, the bracelets, the\r\near-rings, and even the fly-flappers of the attending eunuchs, all being\r\nperfectly distinct as if carved but yesterday. Not far from these, are\r\nseen the king’s cup-bearers, and his grooms leading horses; a\r\nrepresentation of the building of a port, or road, and ships bringing\r\ntimber and other materials to be used in the work; and then come\r\nsea-monsters and various inhabitants of the deep, among which are the\r\nshell-fish which furnished the famous Tyrian dye. In another apartment,\r\nthe gate of which was fastened by a huge wooden lock, are seen the\r\nfigures of tribute-bearers from the various conquered nations, the\r\ngovernors of provinces, &c., bringing their offerings; and in another,\r\npriests, and the eagle-headed divinity, the king himself, and images of\r\nbaked clay, of frightful aspect, which seem to have been teraphim or\r\nidols of some kind. In still other apartments, are the symbolic trees;\r\nsieges of highly fortified places, with battering-rams and other\r\ninstruments of war; manacled prisoners; bow-men and spear-men; eunuchs\r\nengaged, in one place in weighing spoil, and in another in hewing a\r\nprisoner to pieces; the magi, and philosophers; courts of justice;\r\nprisoners bound for trial or punishment; the king putting out the eyes\r\nof a captive; full illustrations of the pleasures of the table and the\r\nchase; the king and his sons engaged in hunting, and also in shooting at\r\na target; various kinds of birds and animals; full historical pictures\r\nof various events; the burning of forts and besieged cities; chairs,\r\naltars, chariots, horses, tables, vases, &c.: in a word, almost\r\neverything connected with the daily life, or social customs, or civil\r\nhistory of the people. The king’s court, the historical chamber, the\r\ninner chamber, the divining-chamber, the hall of judgment, the hall of\r\nhistorical records, the chamber of audience, the presence-chamber, the\r\nbanqueting-hall, the retiring-chamber—all these are but a part of the\r\nnames of apartments in this single palace, each of which abounds in the\r\nsculptures and bass-reliefs which are naturally suggested by their\r\nrespective titles.\r\n\r\nA large number of these wonderful sculptures have been transported to\r\nEngland, and are now in the British museum. The great winged lion and\r\nbull are there, to fix the attention and excite the wonder of every\r\nvisitor; and with these, more than a hundred other sculptures or\r\nbass-reliefs representing scenes like those already described. Many of\r\nthese are from Nimroud, where have been found some representations not\r\nmentioned above, such, for example, as various forms of chariots;\r\nmummers dancing; stables, and horses being curried; the interior of the\r\nroyal kitchen; birds of prey, picking at the dead and dying on the\r\nbattle-field; troops crossing rivers; the siege of Damascus; lion and\r\nbull hunts; Parthian bow-men; the felling of trees; elephants, camels,\r\nand monkeys, &c., &c., all in a style of both art and sculpture quite\r\ndifferent from those at Khorsabad, and apparently less ancient than the\r\nlatter. And in addition to all these things, the sculptures relating to\r\ncostume and dress are quite numerous in many of the apartments of these\r\nruins. The head-dress, the mode of wearing the beard and hair, vases,\r\nrings, bracelets, umbrellas, bronzes, the arrangement of funerals, ivory\r\ncaskets and ornaments, carved heads of various animals, (used as\r\nornaments,) and many other kinds of curiosities, have been found in\r\ngreat numbers.\r\n\r\nAmong the more recent discoveries, made so lately as 1850, Mr. Layard\r\nthinks he has found, in the Nimroud mound, the very throne on which the\r\nreigning monarch of some three thousand years ago sat in his splendid\r\npalace. It is composed of metal and ivory; the former being richly\r\nwrought, and the latter most beautifully carved. It seems to have been\r\nseparated from the state apartments by means of a large curtain, the\r\nrings by which this was drawn and undrawn being still preserved. No\r\nhuman remains have been found, and everything indicates the destruction\r\nof the palace by fire; the throne itself being partially fused, as if by\r\ngreat heat. Beautifully engraved copper vessels have been found at\r\nNimroud; and in Nineveh, a large assortment of slabs illustrative of the\r\nrule, conquests, domestic life, and arts of the ancient Assyrians; and\r\napparently there can be no limit to the number of such discoveries, if\r\nthey are but prosecuted for a sufficient length of time, and with a\r\nsufficient number of laborers. In 1852, Mr. Layard was appointed to an\r\nimportant official post at home, by the British government, so that his\r\npersonal attention to the researches he had so long carried on, was of\r\ncourse suspended. But since that date, the French explorers have been\r\nable to examine the whole palace of Khorsabad and its dependencies; in\r\ndoing which, they have obtained proof that the Assyrians were not\r\nignorant of any of the principles or resources of architecture. Among\r\ntheir discoveries, is a gate twelve feet high, apparently one of the\r\nentrances to the city; several constructions in marble, beautifully\r\nwrought; the cellar of the palace, with regular rows of wine jars, which\r\nhave at the bottom the violet-colored deposit from the evaporated wine,\r\n&c. And in the adjoining mounds and hills within a few leagues of\r\nKhorsabad, they have found monuments, tombs, jewelry, articles of gold\r\nand stone, colossal figures and bass-reliefs, and last, but far from\r\nleast, _a series of full length portraits of the kings of Assyria_! All\r\nthese discoveries, as soon as made, are copied by the photographic\r\nprocess, and sent to Paris, so that ere long, doubtless, all will be\r\nable to see how they appear when reproduced by the skill of the\r\nengraver.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        THE RUINS OF PERSEPOLIS.\r\n\r\nThe most striking feature, on a first approach to these splendid ruins,\r\nis the staircase and its surrounding walls, and the tall slender columns\r\nwhich stand out so prominently to view. Two grand flights of stairs,\r\nfacing each other, lead to the principal platform. To their right is an\r\nimmense wall of the finest masonry, and of the most massive stones; to\r\nthe left, are other walls, equally well built, but not so imposing. On\r\narriving at the summit of the staircase, the first objects which present\r\nthemselves directly facing the platform, are four vast portals and two\r\ncolumns. Two portals first, then the columns, and then two portals\r\nagain. On the front of each are represented, in bass-relief, figures of\r\nanimals, which, for want of a better name, may be called sphinxes. The\r\ntwo sphinxes on the first portals face outwardly, _i. e._, toward the\r\nplain and the front of the building. The two others, on the second\r\nportals, face inwardly, _i. e._, toward the mountain. From the first,\r\n(to the right, on a straight line,) at the distance of fifty-four paces,\r\nis a staircase of thirty steps, the sides of which are ornamented with\r\nbass-reliefs, originally in three rows, but now partly reduced by the\r\naccumulation of earth beneath, and by mutilations above. This staircase\r\nleads to the principal compartment of the whole ruins, which may be\r\ncalled a small plain, thickly studded with columns, sixteen of which are\r\nnow erect. Having crossed this plain, on an eminence are numerous\r\nstupendous remains of frames, both of windows and doors, formed by\r\nblocks of marble of sizes most magnificent. These frames are ranged in a\r\nsquare and indicate an apartment the most royal that can be conceived.\r\nOn each side of the frames are sculptured figures, and the marble still\r\nretains a polish which, in its original state, must have vied with the\r\nfinest mirrors. On each corner of this room are pedestals, of an\r\nelevation much more considerable than the surrounding frames: one is\r\nformed of a single block of marble. The front of this apartment seems to\r\nhave been to the south-west, for few marks of masonry are to be seen on\r\nthat exposure, and the base of that side is richly sculptured and\r\nornamented. This front opens upon a square platform, on which no\r\nbuilding appears to have been raised. But on the side opposite to the\r\nroom just mentioned, there is the same appearance of a corresponding\r\napartment, although nothing but the bases of some small columns, and the\r\nsquare of its floor, attest it to have been such. The interval between\r\nthese two rooms, (on those angles which are the most distant from the\r\ngrand front of the building,) is filled up by the base of a sculpture,\r\nsimilar to the bases of the two rooms, excepting that the center of it\r\nis occupied by a small flight of steps. Behind, and contiguous to these\r\nruins, are the remains of another square room, surrounded on all sides\r\nby frames of doors and windows. On the floor are the bases of columns:\r\nfrom the order in which they appear to have stood, they formed six rows,\r\neach of six columns. A staircase, cut into an immense mass of rock,\r\nleads into the lesser and inclosed plain below. Toward the plain are\r\nalso three smaller rooms, or rather one room and the bases of two\r\nclosets. Everything on this part of the building indicates rooms of rest\r\nor retirement.\r\n\r\nIn the rear of the whole of these remains, are the beds of aqueducts,\r\nwhich are cut into the solid rock. They occur in every part of the\r\nbuilding, and are probably, therefore, as extensive in their course, as\r\nthey are magnificent in their construction. The great aqueduct is to be\r\ndiscovered among a confused heap of stones, not far behind the buildings\r\ndescribed above, on that quarter of the palace, and almost adjoining to\r\na ruined staircase. Its bed in some places is cut ten feet into the\r\nrock. This bed leads east and west; to the eastward its descent is\r\nrapid, about twenty-five paces; it there narrows, but again enlarges, so\r\nthat a man of common hight may stand upright in it. It terminates by an\r\nabrupt rock.\r\n\r\nProceeding from this toward the mountains, situated in the rear of the\r\ngreat hall of columns, stand the remains of a magnificent room. Here are\r\nstill left walls, frames and porticos, the sides of which are thickly\r\nornamented with bass-reliefs of a variety of compositions. This hall is\r\na perfect square. To the right of this, and further to the southward,\r\nare more fragments, the walls and component parts apparently of another\r\nroom. To the left of this, and therefore to the northward of the\r\nbuilding, are the remains of a portal, on which are to be traced the\r\nfeatures of a sphinx. Still toward the north, in a separate collection,\r\nis the ruin of a column, which, from the fragments about it, must have\r\nsupported a sphinx. In a recess of the mountain, to the northward, is a\r\nportico. Almost in a line with the center of the hall of columns, on the\r\nsurface of the mountain, is a tomb. To the southward of that is another,\r\nin like manner on the mountain’s surface; between both, and just on the\r\npoint where the ascent from the plain commences, is a reservoir of\r\nwater. These, according to Mr. Morier, in the account of his embassy to\r\nPersia, constitute some of the principal objects among the ruins of\r\nPersepolis; and this is confirmed by Sir Robert Ker Porter, who gives\r\nstill more copious accounts of these ruins, as may be seen in the very\r\ninteresting narrative of his travels.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        ROYAL PALACE OF ISPAHAN.\r\n\r\nThe palaces of the king are inclosed in a fort of lofty walls, which is\r\nestimated to have a circumference of three miles. The palace of the\r\nChehel Sitoon, or ‘forty pillars,’ is situated in the middle of an\r\nimmense square, which is intersected by various canals, and planted in\r\ndifferent directions by the beautiful chenar tree. In front is an\r\nextensive square basin of water, from the furthest extremity of which\r\nthe palace is beautiful beyond either the power of language or the\r\ncorrectness of pencil to delineate. The first saloon is open toward the\r\ngarden, is supported by eighteen pillars, all inlaid with mirrors, and,\r\nthe glass being in a much greater proportion than the wood, appears at a\r\ndistance to be formed of glass only. Each pillar has a marble base,\r\nwhich is carved into the figures of four lions placed in such attitudes,\r\nthat the shaft seems to rest on their four united backs. The walls,\r\nwhich form its termination behind, are also covered with mirrors placed\r\nin such a variety of symmetrical positions, that the mass of the\r\nstructure appears to be of glass, and when new must have glittered with\r\nmost magnificent splendor. The ceiling is painted in gold flowers, which\r\nare still fresh and brilliant. Large curtains are suspended on the\r\noutside, which are occasionally lowered to lessen the heat of the sun.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          THE TEMPLE OF MECCA.\r\n\r\nThis magnificent temple, to which pilgrims resort from every quarter of\r\nthe globe where the religion of Islamism is practiced, is known by the\r\nMussulmans under the name of El Haram, or the temple of excellence. It\r\nis situated nearly in the middle of the city, which is built in a\r\nvalley, having a considerable slope from the north to the south. It is\r\ncomposed of the house of God, Beit Allah, or as it is called also, La\r\nKaaba; of the well of Zemzem, Bir Zemzem; of the Cobba, or place of\r\nAbraham, Makham Ibrahim; of the places of the four orthodox rites, Makam\r\nHhaneffi, Makam Shaffi, Makam Maleki, and Makam Hhanbeli; of two Cobbas,\r\nor chapels, El-Cobbatain; of an arch, called Babes-selem, (in the same\r\nstyle as a triumphal arch,) near the place of Abraham; of El-Monbar or\r\nthe tribune for the priest; of the wooden staircase, Daureh, which leads\r\nto the saloon of the house of God; of an immense court, surrounded by a\r\ntriple row of arches; of two smaller courts, surrounded with elegant\r\npiazzas; of nineteen doors; and of seven towers, or minarets, five of\r\nwhich adhere to the edifice, and the other two are placed between the\r\nneighboring houses out of the inclosure.\r\n\r\nLa Kaaba, Beit Allah, or the house of God, is a quadrilateral tower, the\r\nsides and angles of which are unequal, so that its plan forms a true\r\ntrapezium. The size of the edifice, and the black cloth which covers it,\r\nmake this irregularity disappear, and give to it the figure of a perfect\r\nsquare. The black stone, Hhajera el Assouad, or heavenly stone, which\r\nall true Mussulmans believe to have been brought thither by the angel\r\nGabriel, is raised forty-two inches above the surface, and is bordered\r\nall round with a large plate of silver, about a foot broad. The part of\r\nthe stone that is not covered by the silver at the angle is almost a\r\nsemicircle, six inches in hight, by about eight inches diameter at its\r\nbase. El Bir Zemzem, or the well of Zemzem, is situated fifty-one feet\r\ndistant to the north-east of the black stone. It is about seven feet and\r\neight inches in diameter, and fifty-six feet deep to the surface of the\r\nwater. The brim is of fine white marble, five feet high. Tradition says\r\nthat this well was miraculously opened by the angel of the Lord for\r\nHagar, when she was nearly perishing from thirst in the desert with her\r\nson Ishmael, after having been sent from Abraham’s house. The Kaaba, and\r\nthe stones of Ishmael, are situated nearly in the center of the temple,\r\nand occupy the middle of an oval or irregular elliptical surface, which\r\nforms a zone of thirty-nine feet wide round the edifice, upon which the\r\npilgrims make their tours round the Kaaba. It is paved with fine marble,\r\nand is situated upon the lowest plane of the temple.\r\n\r\n\r\n              -------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n                             THE HOLY LAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  ------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\nThe entire country known as _Palestine_, or _Judea_, or the _Holy Land_,\r\nis full of interest, and associated to our minds with the wonders and\r\nmiracles connected with the advent of Christ to our world. Time would\r\nfail to notice all the localities of this country, on which the mind\r\nloves to linger; but a few of them will be alluded to. One of these, a\r\nview of which is given in the cut below, is\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JACOB’S WELL.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                             JACOB’S WELL.\r\n\r\nThis was near to Shechem, one of the most ancient cities of Canaan,\r\nwhich was the capital of the kingdom of Israel in the time of Jeroboam,\r\nand was associated with some of the most interesting events of\r\npatriarchal times, as well as with the discourse of Christ to the woman\r\nof Samaria, which resulted in the conversion of several of the\r\nSamaritans to the true faith. “I found this well,” says a late traveler,\r\n“in the midst of the ruins of a magnificent building that once covered\r\nand adorned it. Hewn stones, blocks of marble, and fragments of granite\r\ncolumns, were to be seen amid the general wreck. The narrow mouth of the\r\nwell was stopped up with large loose stones, at which we all tugged\r\nuntil I nearly broke my back; but one of them defied our utmost\r\nendeavors. I kneeled down and peeped into the arched chamber, from the\r\nfloor of which the well proper is sunk into the living rock some hundred\r\nfeet or more. A little, gray-headed old Arab held my horse; the younger\r\nmen stood around and looked on, while I sat down at the indubitable well\r\nof the patriarch, and read: ‘Jesus, therefore, being wearied with his\r\njourney, sat thus on the well: and it was about the sixth hour. There\r\ncometh a woman of Samaria to draw water. Jesus saith unto her, Give me\r\nto drink. (For his disciples had gone away unto the city to buy meat.)\r\nThen saith the woman unto him, How is it that thou, being a Jew, askest\r\ndrink of me, who am a woman of Samaria? (for the Jews have no dealings\r\nwith the Samaritans.) Jesus answered and said unto her, If thou knewest\r\nthe gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink,\r\nthou wouldst have asked of him, and he would have given thee living\r\nwater. The woman saith unto him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with,\r\nand the well is deep; from whence, then, hast thou that living water?\r\nArt thou greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well and drank\r\nthereof himself, and his children, and his cattle? Jesus answered and\r\nsaid unto her, Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again; but\r\nwhosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never\r\nthirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of\r\nwater springing up into everlasting life.’ Here I closed the book, and\r\nwith a gush of unutterable joy, exclaimed,\r\n\r\n      ‘Spring up, O well, I ever cry, spring up within MY soul!’”\r\n\r\n\r\n                               BETHLEHEM.\r\n\r\nBethlehem, celebrated throughout the world as the birthplace of the\r\nRedeemer, is situated at the distance of six miles south-west from\r\nJerusalem, in a fine country, blest with a salubrious air, and abundant\r\nfertility. The water is conveyed in a low aqueduct which formerly passed\r\nto Jerusalem. The _fons signatus_ is a charming spring, yielding a\r\nconstant supply of water to three large cisterns, one of which is still\r\nin good preservation. At a small distance from these, a beautiful\r\nrivulet called the _deliciæ Solomonis_, laves the herbage of the valley,\r\nand fertilizes several fine gardens, while the circumjacent soil is\r\nrichly clothed with an elegant assemblage of fig-trees, vines and\r\nolives.\r\n\r\nBethlehem received its name, which signifies the _house of bread_, from\r\nAbraham; and it was surnamed _Ephratah_, the fruitful, after Caleb’s\r\nwife, to distinguish it from another Bethlehem, in the tribe of Zebulon.\r\nIt belonged to the tribe of Judah, and also went by the name of the city\r\nof David, that monarch having there been born, and tended sheep in his\r\nchildhood. Elimelech, Obed, Jesse, and Boaz, were, like David, natives\r\nof Bethlehem, and here must be placed the scene of the admirable eclogue\r\nof Ruth. Matthew, the apostle, was also born in the village of\r\nBethlehem.\r\n\r\nThe convent now at Bethlehem is connected with the church by a court\r\ninclosed with lofty walls. This court leads by a small side door into\r\nthe church. The edifice is certainly of high antiquity, and though often\r\ndestroyed and as often repaired, it still retains marks of its Grecian\r\norigin. On the pavement at the foot of the altar, you observe a marble\r\nstar, which corresponds, as tradition would have us believe, with the\r\npoint of the heavens where the miraculous star that conducted the three\r\nkings became stationary. The Greeks occupy the choir of the Magi, as\r\nwell as the two other naves formed by the transform of the cross. These\r\nlast are empty, and without altars. Two spiral staircases, each composed\r\nof fifteen steps, open on the sides of the outer church, and conduct to\r\nthe subterraneous church situated beneath this choir. At the further\r\nextremity of the crypt, on the east side, is the spot where tradition\r\nreports that the Redeemer of mankind was born. This spot is marked by a\r\nwhite marble, incrusted with jasper, and surrounded by a circle of\r\nsilver, having rays resembling those with which the sun is represented.\r\nAround it are inscribed these words:\r\n\r\n                       HIC DE VIRGINE MARIA\r\n                       JESUS CHRISTUS NATUS EST.\r\n\r\nAt the distance of seven paces toward the south, after you have passed\r\nthe foot of one of the staircases leading to the upper church, you find\r\nwhat is called “the Manger.” You go down to it by two steps, for it is\r\nnot upon a level with the rest of the crypt. It is a low recess, hewn\r\nout of the rock. A block of white marble, raised about a foot above the\r\nfloor, and hollowed in the form of a manger, indicates the spot where\r\ntradition says our Saviour was laid upon straw. Two paces further,\r\nopposite to the manger, stands an altar, which, the same tradition would\r\nteach, occupies the place where Mary sat when she presented the Child of\r\nSorrow to the adoration of the Magi.\r\n\r\nNothing can be more pleasing to the view than this subterraneous church.\r\nIt is adorned with pictures of the Italian and Spanish schools. These\r\npictures represent the mysteries of the place, the Virgin and Child,\r\nafter Raphael, the annunciation, the adoration of the wise men, the\r\ncoming of the shepherds, and all those miracles of mingled grandeur and\r\ninnocence. The ornaments of the manger are of blue satin embroidered\r\nwith silver. Incense is continually smoking before the cradle of the\r\nSaviour. The grotto of the Nativity leads to the subterraneous chapel,\r\nwhere tradition places the sepulcher of the Innocents: “Herod sent forth\r\nand slew all the children that were in Bethlehem, and in all the coasts\r\nthereof, from two years old and under. Then was fulfilled that which was\r\nspoken by Jeremiah the prophet, saying: In Rama was there a voice\r\nheard,” &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               NAZARETH.\r\n\r\nThe village of Nazareth is situated in a long valley, surrounded by\r\nlofty hills, between which a road leads to the neighboring plain of\r\nEsdraelon, and to Jerusalem. The convent is situated in the lower part\r\nof the village; and the church belonging to it, a very handsome edifice,\r\nis erected over the grotto, or cave, in which (tradition says) the\r\nVirgin Mary took up her residence. The other objects of interest in\r\nNazareth are, the synagogue, where Christ is said to have read the\r\nScriptures to the Jews, at present a church; a precipice without the\r\ntown, where, they say, the Jews endeavored to cast Christ down after his\r\nspeech in the synagogue; and a church called “the church of the\r\nAnnunciation,” erected, as they say, on the spot where Mary, the mother\r\nof our Lord, received the divine message. It is the most magnificent\r\nchurch in the land except that of the Holy Sepulcher at Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    THE HOLY SEPULCHER AT JERUSALEM.\r\n\r\nThe church of the Holy Sepulcher, a view of which is given on the next\r\npage, is very irregular, owing to the nature and situation of the places\r\nwhich it was designed to comprehend. It is nearly in the form of a\r\ncross, being one hundred and twenty paces in length, exclusive of the\r\ndescent to what is called the place of the discovery of the Holy Cross,\r\nand seventy in breadth. It has three domes, of which that covering the\r\nHoly Sepulcher serves for the nave of the church. It is thirty feet in\r\ndiameter, and is covered at the top like the rotunda at Rome. There is\r\nnot any cupola, the roof being supported by large rafters, brought from\r\nMount Lebanon. On entering the church, you come to the “stone of\r\nunction,” on which tradition says the body of our Lord was anointed with\r\nmyrrh and aloes, before it was laid in the sepulcher. Some say, that it\r\nis of the same rock as Mount Calvary; and others assert, that it was\r\nbrought to this place by Joseph and Nicodemus, secret disciples of Jesus\r\nChrist, who performed this pious office, and that it is of a greenish\r\ncolor. Be that as it may, on account of the indiscretion of certain\r\npilgrims, who broke off pieces, it was found necessary to cover it with\r\nwhite marble, and to surround it with an iron railing, lest people\r\nshould walk over it. This stone is eight feet, wanting three inches, in\r\nlength, and two feet, wanting one inch, in breadth: and above it, eight\r\nlamps are kept continually burning.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHURCH OF THE HOLY SEPULCHER.]\r\n\r\nThe Holy Sepulcher, as it is called, is thirty paces from this stone,\r\nexactly in the center of the great dome: it resembles a small closet,\r\nhewn out of the solid rock. The entrance, which faces the east, is only\r\nfour feet high, and two feet and a quarter broad. The interior of the\r\nsepulcher is nearly square. It is six feet, wanting an inch, in length,\r\nand six feet, wanting two inches, in breadth, and from the floor to the\r\nroof, eight feet and one inch. There is a solid block of the same stone,\r\nwhich was left in excavating the other part: this is two feet, four\r\ninches and a half high, and occupies half of the sepulcher, for it is\r\nsix feet, wanting one inch, in length, and two feet and five-sixths\r\nwide. On this table, tradition says, the body of our Lord was laid, with\r\nthe head toward the west, and the feet to the east; but, on account of\r\nthe superstitious devotion of the Orientals, who imagine that, if they\r\nleave their hair upon this stone, God will never forsake them, and also,\r\nbecause the pilgrims broke off pieces, it has received a covering of\r\nwhite marble, on which mass is now celebrated. Forty-four lamps are\r\nconstantly burning in this sacred place, and three holes have been made\r\nin the roof for the emission of the smoke. The exterior of the sepulcher\r\nis also faced with slabs of marble, and adorned with several columns,\r\nhaving a dome above.\r\n\r\nThe Holy Sepulcher is composed of three churches: that of the Holy\r\nSepulcher, properly so called; that of Calvary; and the church of the\r\nDiscovery of the Holy Cross. The first is built in the valley at the\r\nfoot of Calvary, on the spot where tradition reports that the body of\r\nChrist was deposited. This church was in the form of a cross, the chapel\r\nof the Holy Sepulcher constituting, in fact, the nave of the edifice. It\r\nis circular, like the Pantheon at Rome, and is lighted only by a dome,\r\nbeneath which is the sepulcher. Sixteen marble columns adorn the\r\ncircumference of this rotunda: they are connected by seventeen arches,\r\nand support an upper gallery, likewise composed of sixteen columns and\r\nseventeen arches, of smaller dimensions than those of the lower range.\r\nNiches, corresponding with the arches, appear above the frieze of the\r\nsecond gallery, and the dome springs from the arch of these niches.\r\n\r\nThe origin of the church of the Holy Sepulcher is of high antiquity. The\r\nauthor of the “Epitome of the Holy War” asserts, that forty-six years\r\nafter the destruction of Jerusalem by Vespasian and Titus, the\r\nChristians obtained permission of Adrian to build, or rather rebuild, a\r\nchurch over the tomb of their Lord, and to inclose, in the new city, the\r\nother places venerated by the Christians. This church, he adds, was\r\ngreatly enlarged and repaired by Helena, the mother of Constantine.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              MOUNT TABOR.\r\n\r\nThis remarkable mountain, a view of which is given in the cut on the\r\nnext page, is on the confines of Zebulon and Naphthali, on the\r\nnorth-east border of the plain of Esdraelon, about six miles south of\r\nNazareth. It is graceful and picturesque in its outlines, presenting\r\ndifferent appearances as viewed from different points, which accounts\r\nfor the diversities in the pictorial representations we have of it. From\r\nthe north it has the appearance of the segment of a sphere, and appears\r\nbeautifully wooded on the summit, affording retreats to the animals for\r\nwhom “the net was spread on Tabor.” (Hosea v. 1.) From the west it is\r\nlike a truncated cone, appearing much steeper and higher, with the\r\nsouthern side almost destitute of trees. But on all sides it is a marked\r\nand prominent object, as the prophet intimates when he says, “as Tabor\r\nis among the mountains.” (Jeremiah xlvi. 18.) The view from the summit\r\nis truly beautiful. The foundations of ancient buildings, and the\r\nremains of water-tanks, in which cool water is still collected from the\r\ndrippings of the rocks, are still to be seen on the top of Tabor. On\r\nthis mountain was the encampment of Barak’s army on the eve of its\r\nbattle with the hosts of Sisera. (Judges iv. 6, 14.) Tradition indicates\r\nthis as the scene of Christ’s transfiguration. This may well be doubted,\r\nowing to the distance of this mountain from Cæsarea Philippi, near which\r\nplace our Lord left the nine disciples the day before. Besides, this\r\nmountain was at the time occupied by a fortified town, and thus did not,\r\nas well as some other hights, answer the description of “a high mountain\r\napart,” or solitary. (Matthew xvii. 1.) No doubt the name of the\r\nmountain was concealed by design, to avoid giving occasion to the\r\nsuperstitious observances of place, which our Lord foresaw would be\r\npracticed, in after ages, by many calling themselves after his name. The\r\nArab name of Tabor is Jebel-Tur. There was a Levitical city on Tabor of\r\nthe same name. (1 Chronicles vi. 77.) The Tabor mentioned in 1 Samuel x.\r\n3, was not Mount Tabor, but a place in the vicinity of the territory of\r\nBenjamin.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MOUNT TABOR.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                          THE MOUNT OF OLIVES.\r\n\r\nThe following descriptions of some of the spots in the Holy Land which\r\nexcite a more particular interest, are extracted from Dr. Clarke’s very\r\nvaluable “Travels in Europe, Asia, and Africa.”\r\n\r\n“As we advanced, our journey led through an open campaign country,\r\nuntil, upon our right, the guides showed us the mount where it is\r\nbelieved that Christ preached to his disciples that memorable sermon,\r\nconcentrating the sum and substance of every Christian virtue. We left\r\nour route to visit this elevated spot; and, having attained the highest\r\npoint of it, a view was presented, which, for its grandeur,\r\nindependently of the interest excited by the different objects contained\r\nin it, has no parallel in the Holy Land. From this situation we\r\nperceived that the plain, over which we had been so long riding, was\r\nitself very elevated. Far beneath appeared other plains, one lower than\r\nthe other, and extending to the surface of the sea of Tiberias, or sea\r\nof Galilee. This immense lake, almost equal, in the grandeur of its\r\nappearance, to that of Geneva, spreads its waters over all the lower\r\nterritory, extending from the north-east toward the south-west, and then\r\nbearing east of us. Its eastern shores present a sublime scene of\r\nmountains, extending toward the north and south, and seeming to close it\r\nin at either extremity, both toward Chorazin, where the Jordan enters,\r\nand the Aulon, or Campus-magnus, through which it flows to the Dead sea.\r\nThe cultivated plains reaching to its borders, which we beheld at an\r\namazing depth below our view, resembled, by the various hues their\r\ndifferent produce exhibited, the motley pattern of a vast carpet. To the\r\nnorth appeared snowy summits, towering, beyond a series of intervening\r\nmountains, with unspeakable greatness. We considered them as the summits\r\nof Libanus; but the Arabs belonging to our caravan called the principal\r\neminence Jebel el Sieh, saying it was near Damascus; probably,\r\ntherefore, a part of the chain of Libanus. This summit was so lofty,\r\nthat the snow entirely covered the upper part of it; not lying in\r\npatches, as I have seen it, during summer, upon the tops of very\r\nelevated mountains, (for instance, upon that of Ben Nevis, in Scotland,)\r\nbut investing all the higher part with that perfect white and smooth,\r\nvelvet-like appearance which snow exhibits when it is very deep; a\r\nstriking spectacle in such a climate, where the beholder, seeking\r\nprotection from a burning sun, almost considers the firmament to be on\r\nfire.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                          OTHER REVERED SITES.\r\n\r\n“As we rode toward the sea of Tiberias, the guides pointed to a sloping\r\nspot from the hights upon our right, whence we had descended, as the\r\nplace where the miracle was accomplished by which our Saviour fed the\r\nmultitude: it is therefore called the _Multiplication of Bread_; as the\r\nmount above, where the sermon was preached to his disciples, is called\r\nthe _Mountain of Beatitudes_, from the expressions used in the beginning\r\nof that discourse. The lake now continued in view upon our left. The\r\nwind rendered its surface rough, and called to mind the situation of our\r\nSaviour’s disciples, when, in one of the small vessels which traverse\r\nthese waters, they were tossed in a storm, and saw Jesus in the fourth\r\nwatch of the night, walking to them upon the waves. Often as this\r\nsubject has been painted, combining a number of circumstances adapted\r\nfor the representation of sublimity, no artist has been aware of the\r\nuncommon grandeur of the scenery, memorable on account of the\r\ntransaction. The lake of Genesareth is surrounded by objects well\r\ncalculated to highten the solemn impression made by such a picture; and,\r\nindependent of the local feelings likely to be excited in its\r\ncontemplation, affords one of the most striking prospects in the Holy\r\nLand. Along the borders of this lake may still be seen the remains of\r\nthose ancient tombs, hewn by the earliest inhabitants of Galilee, in the\r\nrocks which face the water. Similar works were before noticed among the\r\nruins of Telmessus. They were deserted in the time of our Saviour, and\r\nhad become the resort of wretched men, afflicted by diseases, and made\r\noutcasts of society; for in the account of the cure performed by our\r\nSaviour upon a maniac in the country of the Gadarenes, these tombs are\r\nparticularly alluded to; and their existence to this day, (although they\r\nhave been neither noticed by priests nor pilgrims, and have escaped the\r\nravages of the empress Helena, who would undoubtedly have shaped them\r\ninto churches,) offers strong internal evidence of the accuracy of the\r\nevangelist who has recorded the transaction: ‘There met him _out of the\r\ntombs_ a man with an unclean spirit, who had his dwelling _among the\r\ntombs_.’”\r\n\r\n\r\n                             MOUNT CARMEL.\r\n\r\nMount Carmel is a tall promontory, forming the termination of a range of\r\nhills, in the northern part of Palestine, and toward the sea. It is\r\nfifteen hundred feet high, and is famous for its caverns, which are said\r\nto be more than a thousand in number. Most of them are in the western\r\npart of it. Here also was the cave of the prophet Elijah. Both Elijah\r\nand Elisha used to resort to this mountain, and here it was that the\r\nformer opposed the prophets of Baal with such success. Here it was, too,\r\nthat this prophet went up, when he told his servant to look forth toward\r\nthe sea yet seven times, and the seventh time he saw a cloud coming from\r\nthe sea “like a man’s hand;” when the prophet knew the promised rain was\r\nat hand, and girded up his loins and ran before Ahab’s chariot even to\r\nthe gates of Jezreel. (See 1 Kings xviii. 4-46.)\r\n\r\n\r\n                             MOUNT ARARAT.\r\n\r\nThis mountain, which is highly worthy of our notice as the one on which\r\nthe ark rested, is, by the general consent of western Asia and of\r\nEurope, decided to be the mountain of Ara Dagh in Armenia; and that this\r\nopinion is correct, would seem plain from the statement of the Bible\r\nthat Ararat _was_ in Armenia, taken in connection with the fact, that in\r\nall that country there is no mountain comparable to this. It is in all\r\nrespects a most noble mountain, and one of the finest in the world.\r\n“When our eyes first beheld it,” says Kitto, “we had already seen the\r\nloftiest and most remarkable mountains of the old world; but yet the\r\neffect of the view of _this_ mountain was new and surprising. The reason\r\nappeared to be this, that most of the loftiest mountains of the world\r\nare but peaks of the uppermost ridge of mountain chains; but Ararat,\r\nthough not so high as many of these, is far more grand and impressive,\r\nbecause it is not merely the summit of a ridge, but a whole and perfect\r\nmountain.” “Nothing,” as Mr. Morier well remarks, “can be more beautiful\r\nthan its shape, or more awful than its hight; all the surrounding\r\nmountains sink into insignificance when compared with it. It is perfect\r\nin all its parts; having no hard, rugged features, and no unnatural\r\nprominences; but everything is in harmony, and all combines to render it\r\none of the sublimest objects of nature.” It rises from the valley of the\r\nriver Aras, the ancient _Araxes_, gradually towering from its broad\r\nbase, till it reaches the region of perpetual snow, (which is about\r\none-third below its summit,) when it becomes more conical and steep, and\r\nis surmounted with a crown of ice which glitters in the sun with\r\npeculiar brightness. And near to this peak, and rising from the same\r\nbroad base, is another almost exactly like it, but smaller, which is\r\ndoubtless the reason why the sacred text speaks of “the _mountains_ of\r\nArarat,” rather than of a single mountain. The tallest of the two is\r\nseventeen thousand, seven hundred and fifty, and the lowest thirteen\r\nthousand, four hundred and twenty feet above the level of the sea, which\r\nis some three thousand feet lower than the plain on which Ararat stands.\r\nThe top of the mountain, it is said, was never reached till 1829, when\r\nMr. Parrot, a German, succeeded in climbing to it, and there found a\r\nslightly convex, and almost circular plain, some two hundred and twenty\r\nfeet in diameter, declining steeply on all sides; from which some\r\nsuppose, that the ark must have rested on the lesser Ararat, as it would\r\nhave been difficult for its inmates, including heavy cattle, to have\r\ndescended from the higher summit.\r\n\r\n\r\n              -------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n                        WONDERS OF ART RESUMED.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  ------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n                          THE MOSQUE OF OMAR.\r\n\r\nDr. Clarke, on viewing this mosque, observes, that “the sight was so\r\ngrand, that he did not hesitate to pronounce it the most magnificent\r\npiece of architecture in the Turkish empire, and considered it,\r\nexternally, far superior to the mosque of St. Sophia, in\r\nConstantinople.” By the sides of the spacious area in which it stands,\r\nare certain vaulted remains, which plainly denote the masonry of the\r\nancients; and he thinks that evidence may be adduced to prove, that they\r\nbelonged to the foundations of Solomon’s temple. He observed also that\r\nreticulated stucco, which is commonly considered as an evidence of Roman\r\nwork. Phocas believed the whole space surrounding this building to be\r\nthe ancient area of the temple; and Golius, in his notes upon the\r\nAstronomy of Alferganes, says that the whole foundation of the original\r\nedifice remained. As to the mosque itself, there is no building at\r\nJerusalem that can be compared with it, either in beauty or riches. The\r\nlofty Saracenic pomp so nobly displayed in the style of the building;\r\nits numerous arcades; its capacious dome, with all the stately\r\ndecorations of the place; its extensive area, paved and variegated with\r\nthe choicest marbles; the extreme neatness observed in every avenue\r\ntoward it; and, lastly, the sumptuous costume observable in the dresses\r\nof all the eastern devotees, passing to and from the sanctuary, make it\r\naltogether one of the finest sights the Mohammedans have to boast.\r\n\r\n\r\n                MOSQUE OF ST. SOPHIA AT CONSTANTINOPLE.\r\n\r\nThe dome of this celebrated structure is one hundred and thirteen feet\r\nin diameter, and is built on arches, sustained by vast pillars of\r\nmarble. The pavement and staircase are also of marble. There are two\r\nrows of galleries supported by pillars of party-colored marble, and the\r\nentire roof is of fine mosaic work. In this mosque is the superb tomb of\r\nthe emperor Constantine, for which the Turks have the highest\r\nveneration.\r\n\r\nBeside the above, two other mosques attract the particular notice of\r\ntravelers who visit the Turkish capital. That of the Valide-Sultan,\r\nfounded by the mother of Mohammed IV., is the largest, and is built\r\nentirely of marble. Its proportions are stupendous; and it boasts the\r\nfinest symmetry. The mosque of Sultan Solyman is an exact square, with\r\nfour line towers in the angles; in the center is a noble cupola,\r\nsupported by beautiful marble pillars. Two smaller ones at the\r\nextremities are supported in the same manner. The pavement and gallery\r\nsurrounding the mosque are of marble; and under the great cupola is a\r\nfountain, adorned with such finely colored pillars, that they can\r\nscarcely be deemed of natural marble. On one side is the pulpit, of\r\nwhite marble; and on the other the little gallery for the grand\r\nseignior. A fine staircase leads to it; and it is built up with gilt\r\nlattices. At the upper end is a kind of altar, on which the name of God\r\nis inscribed: and before it stand two candlesticks, six feet in hight,\r\nwith wax candles in proportion. The pavement is spread with fine\r\ncarpets, and the mosque illuminated by a vast number of lamps. The court\r\nleading to it is very spacious, with galleries of marble, supported by\r\ngreen columns, and covered by twenty-eight leaden cupolas on the sides,\r\nwith a fine fountain in the center.\r\n\r\nThe mosque of Sultan Selim I. at Adrianople, is another surprising\r\nmonument of Turkish architecture. It is situated in the center and most\r\nelevated part of the city, so as to make a very noble display. The first\r\ncourt has four gates, and the innermost three; both being surrounded by\r\ncloisters, with marble pillars of the Ionic order, finely polished, and\r\nof very lively colors: the entire pavement is of white marble, and the\r\nroof of the cloisters is divided into several cupolas or domes,\r\nsurmounted with gilt balls. In the midst of each court are fine\r\nfountains of white marble; and, before the grand entrance, is a portico,\r\nwith green marble pillars, provided with five gates. The body of the\r\nmosque is one prodigious dome, adorned with lofty towers, whence the\r\n_imaums_, or priests, call the people to prayers. The ascent to each of\r\nthese towers is very artfully contrived: there is but one door, which\r\nleads to three different staircases, going to three different stories of\r\nthe tower, in such a manner, that three priests may ascend and descend,\r\nby a spiral progress, without meeting each other. The walls of the\r\ninterior are inlaid with porcelain, ornamented with small flowers and\r\nother natural objects, in very lively colors. In the center hangs a vast\r\nlamp of gilt silver, besides which there are at least two thousand\r\nsmaller ones: the whole, when lighted, have a very splendid effect.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           RUINS OF CARTHAGE.\r\n\r\nThe remains of the grandeur and magnificence of Carthage, the rival of\r\nRome, and one of the most commercial cities of the ancient world, are\r\nnot so striking as might be expected; and, at a little distance, can\r\nscarcely be distinguished from the ground on which they lie. The\r\nvestiges of triumphal arches, of superb specimens of Grecian\r\narchitecture, of columns of porphyry or granite, or of curious\r\nentablatures, are no longer discernible: all are vanished; and thus will\r\nit be in future ages with the most renowned cities now on earth!\r\n\r\nTo discover these ruins requires some method. Leaving Tunis, the\r\ntraveler rides along the shore in an east-north-east direction, and\r\nreaches, in about half an hour, the salt-pits, which extend toward the\r\nwest, as far as a fragment of wall, very near to the “great reservoirs.”\r\nPassing between these salt-pits and the sea, jetties are seen running\r\nout to a considerable distance under water. The sea and the jetties are\r\non his right; on his left he perceives a great quantity of ruins, upon\r\neminences of unequal hight; and below these ruins a basin of a circular\r\nform, and of considerable depth, which formerly communicated with the\r\nsea by means of a canal, traces of which are still to be seen. This\r\nbasin appears to have been the “Cothon,” or inner port of Carthage. The\r\nremains of the immense works discernible in the sea, in this case\r\nindicate the site of the outer mole. Some piles of the dam said to have\r\nbeen constructed by Scipio, for the purpose of blocking up the port, may\r\nbe still distinguished. A second inner canal is conjectured to have been\r\nthe cut made by the Carthaginians, when they opened a new passage for\r\ntheir fleet.\r\n\r\nThe greater part of Carthage was built on three hills. On a spot which\r\noverlooks the eastern shore is the area of a spacious room, with several\r\nsmaller ones adjoining: some of them have tesselated pavements; and in\r\nall are found broken pieces of columns of fine marble and porphyry. They\r\nare conjectured to have been summer apartments beneath one of the\r\npalaces, such as the intense heat of the climate must have required. In\r\nrowing along the shore, the common sewers are still visible, and are but\r\nlittle impaired by time. With the exception of these, the cisterns have\r\nsuffered the least. Besides such as belong to private houses, there are\r\ntwo sets for the public use of the Tunisians. The largest of these was\r\nthe grand reservoir, and received the water of the aqueduct. It lay near\r\nthe western wall of the city, and consisted of upward of twenty\r\ncontiguous cisterns, each about one hundred feet in length, and thirty\r\nin breadth. They form a series of vaults, communicating with each other,\r\nand are bordered throughout their whole length by a corridor. The\r\nsmaller reservoir has a greater elevation, and lies near the Cothon or\r\ninner port.\r\n\r\nThe ruins of the noble aqueduct which conveyed the water into the larger\r\ncisterns, may be traced as far as Zawan and Zungar, at least fifty miles\r\ndistant. This must have been a truly magnificent, and at the same time,\r\na very expensive work. That part of it which extends along the peninsula\r\nwas beautifully faced with stone. At Arriana, a village to the north of\r\nTunis, are several entire arches each seventy feet high, and supported\r\nby piers sixteen feet square. The water-channel is vaulted over, and\r\nplastered with a strong cement. A person of an ordinary hight may walk\r\nupright in it; and at intervals are apertures, left open, as well for\r\nthe admission of fresh air, as for the convenience of cleansing it. The\r\nwater-mark is nearly three feet high; but it is impossible to determine\r\nthe quantity daily conveyed to Carthage by this channel, without knowing\r\nthe angle of descent, which, in its present imperfect state, can not be\r\nascertained.\r\n\r\nTemples were erected at Zawan and Zungar, over the fountains by which\r\nthis aqueduct was supplied. That at Zungar appears to have been of the\r\nCorinthian order, and terminates very beautifully in a dome with three\r\nniches, probably intended for the statues of the divinity of the spring.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           THE PLAIN OF TROY.\r\n\r\nAccording to Homer’s description of the Trojan territory, it combined\r\ncertain prominent and remarkable features, not likely to be affected by\r\nany lapse of time. Of this nature was the Hellespont; the island of\r\nTenedos; the plain itself; the river by whose inundations it was\r\noccasionally overflowed; and the mountain whence that river issued. The\r\nfollowing is an abstract of Dr. Clarke’s accurate account of the\r\nvestiges of high antiquity contained in this truly classic spot.\r\n\r\n“We entered an immense plain, in which some Turks were engaged in\r\nhunting wild-boars. Peasants were also employed in plowing a deep and\r\nrich soil of vegetable earth. Proceeding toward the east, and round the\r\nbay distinctly pointed out by Strabo as the harbor in which the Grecian\r\nfleet was stationed, we arrived at the sepulcher of Ajax, upon the\r\nancient Rhœtean promontory. The view here afforded of the Hellespont and\r\nthe plain of Troy is one of the finest the country affords. From the\r\n_Aianteum_ we passed over a heathy country to Halil Elly, a village near\r\nthe Thymbrius, in whose vicinity we had been instructed to seek the\r\nremains of a temple once sacred to the Thymbrean Apollo. The ruins we\r\nfound were rather the remains of ten temples than of one. The earth to a\r\nvery considerable extent was covered by subverted and broken columns of\r\nmarble, granite, and of every order in architecture. Doric, Ionic and\r\nCorinthian capitals lay dispersed in all directions, and some of these\r\nwere of great beauty. We observed a bass-relief representing a person on\r\nhorseback pursued by a winged figure; also a beautiful representation,\r\nsculptured after the same manner, of Ceres in her car drawn by two scaly\r\nserpents.\r\n\r\n“At the town or village of Tchiblack, we noticed very considerable\r\nremains of ancient sculpture, but in such a state of disorder and ruin,\r\nthat no precise description of them can be given. The most remarkable\r\nare upon the top of a hill called Beyan Mezaley, near the town, in the\r\nmidst of a beautiful grove of oak-trees, toward the village of Callifat.\r\nHere the ruins of a Doric temple of white marble lay heaped in the most\r\nstriking manner, mixed with broken stelæ, cippi, sarcophagi, cornices\r\nand capitals of very enormous size, entablatures and pillars. All of\r\nthese have reference to some peculiar sanctity by which this hill was\r\nanciently characterized. We proceeded hence toward the plain; and no\r\nsooner reached it, than a tumulus of very remarkable size and situation\r\ndrew our attention, for a short time, from the main object of our\r\npursuit. This tumulus, of a high conical form and very regular\r\nstructure, stands altogether insulated. Of its great antiquity no doubt\r\ncan be entertained by persons accustomed to view the everlasting\r\nsepulchers of the ancients. On the southern side of its base is a long\r\nnatural mound of limestone: this, beginning to rise close to the\r\nartificial tumulus, extends toward the village of Callifat, in a\r\ndirection nearly from north to south across the middle of the plain. It\r\nis of such hight that an army encamped on the eastern side of it, would\r\nbe concealed from all observation of persons stationed on the coast, by\r\nthe mouth of the Mender. If the poems of Homer, with reference to the\r\nplain of Troy, have similarly associated an artificial tumulus and a\r\nnatural mound, a conclusion seems warranted, that these are the objects\r\nto which he alludes. This appears to be the case in the account he has\r\ngiven of the _tomb of Ilus_ and the _mound of the plain_. From this tomb\r\nwe descended into the plain, when our guides brought us to the western\r\nside of it, near its southern termination, to notice a tumulus, less\r\nconsiderable than the last described, about three hundred paces from the\r\nmound, almost concealed from observation by being continually\r\noverflowed, upon whose top two small oak-trees were then growing.\r\n\r\n“We now came to an elevated spot of ground, surrounded on all sides by a\r\nlevel plain, watered by the Callifat Osmack, and which there is every\r\nreason to believe the _Simoisian_. Here we found, not only the traces,\r\nbut also the remains of an ancient citadel. Turks were then employed\r\nraising enormous blocks of marble, from foundations surrounding the\r\nplace; possibly the identical works constructed by Lysimachus, who\r\nfenced New Ilium with a wall. All the territory within these foundations\r\nwas covered by broken pottery, whose fragments were parts of those\r\nancient vases now held in such high estimation. Many Greek medals had\r\nbeen discovered in consequence of the excavations made there by the\r\nTurks. As these medals, bearing indisputable legends to designate the\r\npeople by whom they were fabricated, have also, in the circumstances of\r\ntheir discovery, a peculiar connection with the ruins here, they may be\r\nconsidered as indicating, with tolerable certainty, the situation of the\r\ncity to which they belonged. These ruins evidently appear to be the\r\nremains of New Ilium; whether we regard the testimony afforded by their\r\nsituation, as accordant with the text of Strabo, or the discovery there\r\nmade of medals of the city.”\r\n\r\nThe conclusions relative to Troas, drawn by this learned writer, are as\r\nfollows. “That the river Mender is the Scamander of Homer, Strabo, and\r\nPliny. The _amnis navigabilis_ of Pliny flows into the archipelago, to\r\nthe south of Sigeum. That the Aianteum, or tomb of Ajax, still remains,\r\nanswering the description given of its situation by ancient authors, and\r\nthereby determining also the exact position of the naval station of the\r\nGreeks. That the Thymbrius is yet recognized, both in its present\r\nappellation _Thymbreck_, and in its geographical position. That the\r\nspacious plain lying on the north-eastern side of the Mender, and\r\nwatered by the Callifat Osmack, is the Simoisian, and that stream the\r\nSimois. That the ruins of Palaio Callifat are those of the Ilium of\r\nStrabo. Eastward is the Throsmos, or mound of the plain. That Udjek Tepe\r\nis the tomb of Æsyetes. The other tombs mentioned by Strabo, as at\r\nSigeum, are all in the situation he describes. That the springs of\r\nBonarbashy may possibly have been the ‘_Doiai Pelai_’ of Homer; but they\r\nare not sources of the Scamander. They are, moreover, _warm_ springs.\r\nThat the source of the Scamander is in Gargarus, now called _Kasdaghy_,\r\nthe highest mountain of all the Idæan chain. That the altars of Jupiter,\r\nmentioned by Homer, and by Eschylus, were on the hill called Kuchunlu\r\nTepe, at the foot of Gargarus; where the ruins of the temple now remain.\r\nThat Palae Scepsis is yet recognized in the appellation Esky Skupshu;\r\nthat Æna is the Ainei of Strabo; and Æne Tepe, perhaps, the tomb of\r\nÆneas. That the extremity of the Adramyttian gulf inclines round the\r\nridge of Gargarus, toward the north-east; so that the circumstance of\r\nXerxes having this mountain upon his left, in his march from Antandrus\r\nto Abydus, is thereby explained. And lastly, that Gargarus affords a\r\nview, not only of all the plain of Troy, but of all the district of\r\nTroas, and a very considerable portion of the rest of Asia Minor.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                                ATHENS.\r\n\r\nThe approach to this celebrated city by sea, presents a spectacle, which\r\nwas viewed by Dr. Clarke and his companions with great transports of\r\njoy. It was no sooner descried, than its lofty edifices, catching the\r\nsun’s rays, rendered the buildings in the Acropolis visible at the\r\ndistance of fifteen miles.\r\n\r\n“The reflected light gave them a white appearance. The Parthenon\r\nappeared first, above a long chain of hills in the front; presently we\r\nsaw the top of Mount Anchesmus, to the left of the temple; the whole\r\nbeing backed by a lofty mountainous ridge, which we supposed to be\r\nParnes. As we drew near to the walls, we beheld the vast Cecropian\r\ncitadel, crowned with temples that originated in the veneration once\r\npaid to the memory of the illustrious dead, surrounded by objects\r\ntelling the same theme of sepulchral grandeur, and now monuments of\r\ndeparted greatness, gradually moldering in all the solemnity of ruin. So\r\nparamount is this funeral character in the approach to Athens from the\r\nPiræeus, that, as we passed the hill of the Museum, which was, in fact,\r\nan ancient cemetery of the Athenians, we might have imagined ourselves\r\nto be among the tombs of Telmessus, from the number of the sepulchers\r\nhewn in the rock, and from the antiquity of the workmanship, evidently\r\nnot of later date than anything of the kind in Asia Minor. In other\r\nrespects the city exhibits nearly the appearance so briefly described by\r\nStrabo eighteen centuries before our coming; and, perhaps, it wears a\r\nmore magnificent aspect, owing to the splendid remains of Adrian’s\r\ntemple of Olympian Jove, which did not exist when Athens was visited by\r\nthe disciple of Xenarchus. The prodigious columns belonging to this\r\ntemple appeared full in view between the citadel and the bed of the\r\nIlissus: high upon our left rose the Acropolis, in the most impressive\r\ngrandeur: an advanced part of the rock upon the western side of it is\r\nthe hill of the Areopagus, a view of which is given in the cut on the\r\nnext page, where St. Paul preached to the Athenians, and where their\r\nmost solemn tribunal was held. Beyond all, appeared the beautiful plain\r\nof Athens, bounded by Mount Hymettus. We rode toward the craggy rock of\r\nthe citadel, passing some tiers of circular arches at the foot of it;\r\nthese are the remains of the Odeum of Herodes Atticus, built in memory\r\nof his wife Regilla. Thence continuing to skirt the base of the\r\nAcropolis, the road winding rather toward the north, we saw also, upon\r\nour left, scooped in the solid rock, the circular sweep on which the\r\nAthenians were wont to assemble to hear the plays of Eschylus, and where\r\nthe theater of Bacchus was afterward constructed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE AREOPAGUS.]\r\n\r\n“We proceeded toward the east, to ascend Mount Anchesmus, and to enjoy\r\nin one panoramic survey the glorious prospect presented from its summit,\r\nof all the antiquities and natural beauties in the Athenian plain. We\r\nascended to the commanding eminence of the mount, once occupied by a\r\ntemple of Anchesmian Jupiter. The pagan shrine has, as usual, been\r\nsucceeded by a small Christian sanctuary: it is dedicated to St. George.\r\nOf the view from this rock, even Wheeler could not write without\r\nemotion. ‘Here,’ said he, ‘a Democritus might sit and laugh at the pomps\r\nand vanities of the world, whose glories so soon vanish; or a Heraclitus\r\nweep over its manifold misfortunes, telling sad stories of the various\r\nchanges and events of fate.’ The prospect embraces every object,\r\nexcepting only those upon the south-west side of the castle. The\r\nsituation of the observer is north-east of the city; and the reader may\r\nsuppose him to be looking, in a contrary direction, toward the\r\nAcropolis, which is in the center of this fine picture; thence regarding\r\nthe whole circuit of the citadel, from its north-western side, toward\r\nthe south and cast, the different parts of it occur in the following\r\norder, although to a spectator they all appear to be comprehended in one\r\nview. The lofty rocks of the Acropolis, crowned with its majestic\r\ntemples, the Parthenon, Erectheum, &c., constitute the central object.\r\nIn the foreground is displayed the whole of the modern city of Athens,\r\nwith its gardens, ruins, mosques, and walls, spreading into the plain\r\nbeneath the citadel. On the right, or north-west wing, is the temple of\r\nTheseus; and on the left, or south-west wing, the temple of Jupiter\r\nOlympius. Proceeding from the west to the south and east, the view\r\nbeyond the citadel displays the Areopagus, the Pnyx, the Ilissus, the\r\nsite of the temple of Ceres in Agræ, the fountain Callirhoe, the Stadium\r\nPanthenaium, the site of the Lyceum, &c. In a parallel circuit, with a\r\nmore extended radius, are seen the hills and defile of Daphne, or the\r\nVia Sacra, the Piræeus, Munychia and Phalerum, Salmais, Ægina, the more\r\ndistant isles, and Hymettus. A similar circuit, but still more extended,\r\nembraces Parnes, the mountains beyond Elusis and Megara, the Acropolis\r\nof Corinth, the Peloponnesian mountains, and the Ægean and distant\r\nislands. And lastly, immediately beneath the eye, lies the plain of\r\nAthens.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TEMPLE OF JUPITER OLYMPIUS.]\r\n\r\nOf the many ruins without the city of Athens, the tourist notices with\r\npeculiar interest those of the temple of Jupiter Olympius, as it was the\r\nfirst conceived and the last executed of all the sacred monuments of\r\nAthens. It was begun by Pisistratus, but was not finished till the time\r\nof the Roman emperor Adrian, which was some seven hundred years\r\nafterward. All that remains of this once magnificent building, is seen\r\nin the cut on the previous page. Originally there were one hundred and\r\ntwenty columns supporting this noble temple; but of all these, only some\r\nsixteen remain; standing in their silent and solitary grandeur to\r\ntestify of the triumphs of ancient art, and to the power of Time the\r\ndestroyer.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         TEMPLES OF ELEPHANTA.\r\n\r\nThe island of Elephanta, distant about two leagues from Bombay, has a\r\ncircumference of about three miles, and consists of two rocky mountains,\r\ncovered with trees and brushwood. Near the landing-place is the figure\r\nof an elephant, as large as life, shaped out of a rock, and supposed to\r\nhave given its name to the island. Having ascended the mountain by a\r\nnarrow path, the visitor reaches the excavation which has so long\r\nexcited the attention of the curious, and afforded such ample scope for\r\nthe discussion of antiquarians. With the strongest emotions of surprise\r\nand admiration, he beholds four rows of massive columns cut out of the\r\nsolid rock, uniform in their order, and placed at regular distances, so\r\nas to form three magnificent avenues from the principal entrance to the\r\ngrand idol which terminates the middle vista; the general effect being\r\nhightened by the blueness of the light, or rather gloom, peculiar to the\r\nsituation. The central image is composed of three colossal heads,\r\nreaching nearly from the floor to the roof, a hight of fifteen feet. It\r\nrepresents the triad deity in the Hindoo mythology, Brama, Vishnu, and\r\nSiva, in the characters of the creator, preserver, and destroyer. The\r\nmiddle face displays regular features, and a mild and serene character;\r\nthe towering head-dress is much ornamented, as are those on each side,\r\nwhich appear in profile, lofty, and richly adorned with jewels. The\r\ncountenance of Vishnu has the same mild aspect as that of Brama; but the\r\nvisage of Siva is very different: severity and revenge, characteristic\r\nof his destroying attribute, are strongly depicted; one of the hands\r\nembraces a large _cobra de capello_; while the others contain fruit,\r\nflowers, and blessings for mankind, among which the lotus and\r\npomegranate are readily distinguishable. The former of these, the lotus,\r\nso often introduced into the Hindoo mythology, forms a principal object\r\nin the sculpture and paintings of their temples, is the ornament of\r\ntheir sacred lakes, and the most conspicuous beauty in their flowery\r\nsacrifices.\r\n\r\nOn either side of the Elephanta triad, is a gigantic figure leaning on a\r\ndwarf, an object frequently introduced in these excavations. The giants\r\nguard the triple deity, and separate it from a large recess filled with\r\na variety of figures, male and female, in different attitudes: they are\r\nin tolerable proportion, but do not express any particular character of\r\ncountenance: one conspicuous female, like the Amazons, is\r\nsingle-breasted; the rest, whether intended for goddesses or mortals,\r\nare generally adorned, like the modern Hindoo women, with bracelets and\r\nrings for the ankles; the men have bracelets only. The intervening space\r\nbetween these figures is occupied by small aerial beings, hovering about\r\nthem in infinite variety. The larger images in these groups are in\r\nalto-relievo, and most of the smaller in basso-relievo, brought\r\nsufficiently forward from the rock to produce a good effect. The sides\r\nof the temple are adorned with similar compositions, placed at regular\r\ndistances, and terminating the avenues formed by the colonnades, so that\r\nonly one group is seen at a time, except on a near approach; and the\r\nregularity and proportion of the whole are remarkably striking. The\r\nfigures are in general in graceful attitudes; but those of herculean\r\nstature do not indicate any extraordinary muscular strength. Among many\r\nthousands of them, few of the countenances express any particular\r\npassion, or mark a decided character: they have generally a sleepy\r\naspect, and bear a greater resemblance to the tame sculpture of Egypt\r\nthan to the animated works of the Grecian chisel. From the right and\r\nleft avenues of the principal temple are passages to smaller excavations\r\non each side: that on the right is much decayed, and very little of the\r\nsculpture remains entire. A pool of water penetrates from it into a dark\r\ncavern far under the rock; but whether natural or artificial, has not\r\nbeen decided. A small corresponding temple on the left side, contains\r\ntwo baths, one of them elegantly finished: the front is open, and the\r\nroof supported by pillars of a different order from those in the large\r\ntemple; the sides are adorned with sculpture, and the roof and cornice\r\npainted in mosaic patterns; some of the colors are still bright. The\r\nopposite bath, of the same proportions, is less ornamented; and between\r\nthem is a room detached from the rock, containing a colossal\r\nrepresentation of the _lingam_, or symbol of Siva. Several small caves\r\nbranch out from the grand excavations.\r\n\r\nAn anecdote is related by Mr. Forbes, in his “Oriental Memoirs,”\r\nrelative to these sculptured monuments. He accompanied an eminent\r\nEnglish artist on his first visit to the Elephanta. “After the glare of\r\na tropical sun, during the walk from the landing-place, it was some time\r\nbefore the eye had accommodated itself to the gloom of these\r\nsubterraneous chambers, sufficiently to discriminate objects in that\r\nsomber light. We remained for several minutes without speaking, or\r\nlooking particularly at each other: at length, when more familiarized to\r\nthe cavern, my companion still remaining silent, I expressed some fear\r\nof having been too warm in my description, and that like most other\r\nobjects, the reality fell short of the anticipated pleasure. He soon\r\nrelieved my anxiety by declaring, that however highly I had raised his\r\nimagination, he was so absorbed in astonishment and delight, on entering\r\nthis stupendous scene, as to forget where he was. He had seen the most\r\nstriking objects of art in Italy and Greece; but never anything which\r\nfilled his mind with such extraordinary sensations.” So enraptured was\r\nthis artist with the spot, that after staying until a late hour, he\r\nquitted it most reluctantly. The caves of the isle of Elephanta can not\r\nbe sufficiently admired, when the immensity of such an undertaking, the\r\nnumber of artificers employed, and the extraordinary genius of its\r\nprojector, are considered, in a country until lately accounted rude and\r\nbarbarous by the now enlightened nations of Europe. Had this work been\r\nraised from a foundation, like other structures, it would have excited\r\nthe admiration of the curious; but when the reflection is made, that it\r\nis hewn inch by inch in the hard and solid rock, how great must the\r\nastonishment be at the conception and completion of the enterprise!\r\n\r\n\r\n                          TEMPLES OF SALSETTE.\r\n\r\nThe excavations of the island of Salsette, also contiguous to Bombay,\r\nare hewn in the central mountains. The great temple is excavated at some\r\ndistance from the summit of a steep mountain, in a commanding situation.\r\nThis stupendous work is upward of ninety feet long, thirty-eight wide,\r\nand of a proportionate hight, hewn out of the solid rock, and forming an\r\noblong square, with a fluted concave roof. The area is divided into\r\nthree aisles by regular colonnades, similar to the ancient basilic, a\r\npile of building twice as long as it was wide, and one of the\r\nextremities of which terminated in a hemicycle, two rows of columns\r\nforming a spacious area in the center, and leaving a narrow walk between\r\nthe columns and the wall. In these _basilici_ the Roman emperors of the\r\neast frequently administered justice. This magnificent excavation at\r\nSalsette appears to be on the same plan, although, doubtless, intended\r\nfor a place of worship. Toward the termination of the temple, fronting\r\nthe entrance, is a circular pile of solid rock, nineteen feet high, and\r\nforty-eight in circumference, most probably a representation of the\r\n_lingam_, the symbol already alluded to in the description of the\r\ntemples of Elephanta. In this temple there are not any images, nor any\r\nkind of sculpture, except on the capitals of the pillars, which are in\r\ngeneral finished in a very masterly style, and are little impaired by\r\ntime. Several have been left in an unfinished state; and on the summit\r\nof others is something like a bell, between elephants, horses, lions,\r\nand animals of different kinds.\r\n\r\nThe lofty pillars and concave roof of the principal temple at Salsette\r\npresent a much grander appearance than the largest excavation at the\r\nElephanta, although that is much richer in statues and bass-reliefs. The\r\nportico at Salsette, of the same hight and breadth as the temple, is\r\nrichly decorated: on each side a large niche contains a colossal statue,\r\nwell executed; and facing the entrance are small single figures, with\r\ngroups in various attitudes, all of them in good preservation. The outer\r\nfront of the portico, and the area before it, corresponding in grandeur\r\nwith the interior, are now injured by time, and the moldering sculpture\r\nintermingled with a variety of rock-plants. On the square pillars at the\r\nentrance are long inscriptions, the characters of which are obsolete,\r\nand which modern ingenuity has not as yet succeeded in deciphering.\r\nFurther up the mountain, a flight of steps, hewn in the rock, and\r\ncontinued to the summit, leads, by various intricate paths, to smaller\r\nexcavations, most of which consist of two rooms, a portico and benches,\r\ncut in the rock. To each is annexed a cistern of about three cubic feet,\r\nalso hewn in the rock, for the preservation of rain-water. Some of these\r\nexcavations are larger and better finished than others; and a few,\r\nalthough inferior in size and decoration, in their general effect\r\nresemble the principal temple.\r\n\r\nThe whole appearance of this excavated mountain indicates it to have had\r\na city hewn in its rocky sides, capable of containing many thousand\r\ninhabitants. The largest temple was, doubtless, their principal place of\r\nworship; and the smaller, on the same plan, inferior ones. The rest were\r\nappropriated as dwellings for the inhabitants, differing in size and\r\naccommodation according to their respective ranks in society; or, as it\r\nis still more probable, these habitations were the abode of religious\r\nBramins, and of their pupils, when India was the nursery of art and\r\nscience, and the nations of Europe were involved in ignorance and\r\nbarbarism.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        MAUSOLEUM OF HYDER ALI.\r\n\r\nThis splendid monument of oriental grandeur is situated at the western\r\nextremity of the great garden of Seringapatam, a city of Hindoostan, and\r\ncapital of the Mysore territory. It is surrounded by a grove of\r\nbeautiful cypress-trees, and was erected by Tippoo Saib in honor of the\r\ndeceased sovereign, his father. Beneath tombs of black marble, elevated\r\nabout eighteen inches from the ground, lie the bodies of Hyder Ali, his\r\nconsort, and Tippoo Saib. They are covered with rich cloths, and have\r\ncanopies over them. The whole of this sumptuous edifice is, together\r\nwith its dome, supported by brilliantly polished black marble columns.\r\nIt is surrounded by a magnificent area, within which the faquirs have\r\ncells allotted to them; and on an elevated platform are the tombs of\r\nseveral faithful servants. The mosque annexed to it is flanked by two\r\ntowers. The moulahs stationed there still publicly read the Koran; and\r\nthree pagodas are daily distributed in charity at the mausoleum.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            THE TAJE MAHAL.\r\n\r\nThis grand mausoleum, which stands due north and south, on the southern\r\nbank of the river Jumna, was built by command of the emperor Shah Jehan\r\nfor the interment of his favorite sultana Momtaz-mehl, or Montazal\r\nZumani, the “preëminent in the seraglio,” or “paragon of the age,” and\r\nat his death his remains were also here deposited, by order of his son\r\nAurungzebe. This building, in point of design and execution, is one of\r\nthe most extensive, elegant, commodious, and perfect works ever\r\nundertaken and finished by one man. To this celebrated architect Shah\r\nJehan gave the title of Zerreer-dust, or “jewel-handed,” to distinguish\r\nhim from all other artists. It is built entirely of pure white marble,\r\non an immense square platform of the same material, having a lofty\r\nminaret of equal beauty at every corner. On each side and behind the\r\nimperial mausoleum, is a suite of elegant apartments, also of white\r\nmarble, highly decorated with colored stones. The tombs and other\r\nprincipal parts of this vast fabric are inlaid with wreaths of flowers\r\nand foliage in their natural colors, entirely composed of carnelians,\r\nonyxes, verd-antique, _lapis lazuli_, and a variety of agates, so\r\nadmirably finished as to have the appearance of an ivory model set with\r\njewels. It was commenced in the fifth year of the reign of the emperor\r\nShah Jehan, and the whole completed in sixteen years, four months, and\r\ntwenty-one days. It cost ninety-eight lacs, or nine million, eight\r\nhundred and fifteen thousand rupees, equal to more than six million\r\ndollars, although the price of labor then was, and still continues to\r\nbe, very reasonable in India.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          GREAT WALL OF CHINA.\r\n\r\nThis stupendous wall, a view of which is given in the cut below, extends\r\nacross the northern boundary of the Chinese empire, and is deservedly\r\nranked among the grandest labors of art. It is conducted over the\r\nsummits of high mountains, several of which have an elevation of over\r\nfive thousand feet, across deep valleys and over wide rivers, by means\r\nof arches: in many parts it is doubled or trebled, to command important\r\npasses; and at the distance of nearly every hundred yards is a tower or\r\nmassive bastion. Its extent is computed at fifteen hundred miles; but in\r\nsome parts, where less danger is apprehended, it is not equally strong\r\nor complete, and toward the north-west consists merely of a strong\r\nrampart of earth. Near Kookpekoo it is twenty-five feet in hight, and\r\nthe top about fifteen feet thick: some of the towers, which are square,\r\nare forty-eight feet high, and about forty feet in width. In its\r\nstrongest parts, and for hundreds of miles in extent, this wall is so\r\nthick as to allow six men on horseback to ride upon it. The structure\r\nconsists of two parallel walls of solid masonry, filled in between with\r\nearth; the top is paved with stone. The stone employed in the\r\nfoundations, angles, &c., is a strong gray granite; but the materials\r\nfor the most part consist of bluish bricks, and the mortar is remarkably\r\npure and white. The amount of materials used in constructing this wall,\r\nis immense. In a lecture on China, given a year or two since in England,\r\nDr. Bowring said it had been calculated, that if all the bricks, stones\r\nand masonry of Great Britain were gathered together, they would not be\r\nable to furnish materials enough for the wall of China; and that all the\r\nbuildings in London put together would not make the towers and turrets\r\nwhich adorn it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GREAT WALL OF CHINA.]\r\n\r\nThe area of the construction of this great barrier, which has been and\r\nwill continue to be the wonder and admiration of ages, is considered by\r\nSir George Staunton as having been absolutely ascertained; and he\r\nasserts that it has existed for two thousand years. In this assertion he\r\nappears to have followed Du Halde, who informs us that “this prodigious\r\nwork was constructed two hundred and fifteen years before the birth of\r\nChrist, by order of the first emperor of the family of Tsin, to protect\r\nthree large provinces from the irruptions of the Tartars.” However, in\r\nthe history of China, contained in his first volume, he ascribes this\r\nerection to the second emperor of the dynasty of Tsin, named Chi Hoang\r\nTi; and the date immediately preceding the narrative of this\r\nconstruction is the year 137 before the birth of Christ. Hence\r\nsuspicions may arise, not only concerning the epoch when this work was\r\nundertaken, but also as to the purity and precision of the Chinese\r\nannals in general. Mr. Bell, who resided some time in China, and whose\r\ntravels are deservedly esteemed for the accuracy of their information,\r\nassures us that this wall was built somewhere about the year 1160, by\r\none of the emperors, to prevent the frequent incursions of the Monguls,\r\nwhose numerous cavalry used to ravage the provinces, and effect their\r\nescape before an army could be assembled to oppose them. Renaudot\r\nobserves that this wall is not mentioned by any oriental geographer\r\nwhose writings boast a higher antiquity than three hundred years; and it\r\nis surprising that it should have escaped Marco Paulo, who, admitting\r\nthat he entered China by a different route, can hardly be supposed,\r\nduring his long residence in the north of China, and in the country of\r\nthe Monguls, to have remained ignorant of so stupendous a work. Amid\r\nthese difficulties, it may be reasonably conjectured, that similar modes\r\nof defense had been adopted in different ages; and that the ancient rude\r\nbarrier, having fallen into decay, was replaced by the present erection,\r\nwhich, even from its state of preservation, can scarcely aspire to a\r\nvery remote antiquity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PORCELAIN TOWER AT NANKIN.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                       PORCELAIN TOWER AT NANKIN.\r\n\r\nThis elegant and commodious building, a very correct idea of which may\r\nbe formed from the cut on the preceding page, may be regarded as a fine\r\nspecimen of the oriental pagodas. The tower is about two hundred feet in\r\nhight, and derives its name from its having a porcelain coating. The\r\nPortuguese were the first to bestow on these superb edifices the title\r\nof pagodas, and to attribute them to devotional purposes. There can be\r\nlittle doubt, however, that in many instances they have been rather\r\nerected as public memorials or ornaments, like the columns of the Greeks\r\nand Romans. Mr. Ellis, in his “Journal of the Embassy to China,” relates\r\nthat, in company with three gentlemen of the embassy, he succeeded in\r\npassing completely through the uninhabited part of the city of Nankin,\r\nand in reaching the gateway visible from the Lion hill. The object of\r\nthe party was to have penetrated through the streets to the porcelain\r\ntower, apparently distant two miles. To this, however, the soldiers who\r\naccompanied them, and who from their willingness in allowing them to\r\nproceed thus far, were entitled to consideration, made so many\r\nobjections, that they were forced to desist, and to content themselves\r\nwith proceeding to a temple on a neighboring hill, from which they had a\r\ncomplete view of the city. From this station the porcelain tower\r\npresented itself as a most magnificent object.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         THE SHOEMADOO AT PEGU.\r\n\r\nThe object in Pegu that most attracts and most merits notice, says Mr.\r\nSymes in his “Embassy to Ava,” is the noble edifice of Shoemadoo, or the\r\nGolden Supreme. This extraordinary pile of buildings is erected on a\r\ndouble terrace, one raised upon another. The lower and greater terrace\r\nis about ten feet above the natural level of the ground, forming an\r\nexact parallelogram: the upper and lesser terrace is similar in shape,\r\nrising about twenty feet above the lower terrace, or thirty above the\r\nlevel of the country. Mr. Symes judged a side of the lower terrace to be\r\nthirteen hundred and ninety-one feet; of the upper, six hundred and\r\neighty-four. The walls that sustained the sides of the terrace, both\r\nupper and lower, are in a ruinous state; they were formerly covered with\r\nplaster, wrought into various figures; the area of the lower is strewed\r\nwith the fragments of small decayed buildings, but the upper is kept\r\nfree from filth, and is in tolerable good order. There is reason to\r\nconclude that this building and the fortress are coeval, as the earth of\r\nwhich the terraces are composed appears to have been taken from the\r\nditch; there being no other excavation in the city, or in its\r\nneighborhood, that could have afforded a tenth part of the quantity.\r\n\r\nThe terraces are ascended by flights of stone steps, which are now\r\nbroken and neglected. On each side are dwellings of the Rhahaans, raised\r\non timbers four or five feet from the ground: these houses consist only\r\nof a large hall; the wooden pillars that support them are turned with\r\nneatness; the roofs are covered with tiles, and the sides are made of\r\nboards; and there are a number of bare benches in every house, on which\r\nthe Rhahaans sleep; but we saw no other furniture.\r\n\r\nThe Shoemadoo is a pyramidal building composed of brick and mortar,\r\nwithout excavation or aperture of any sort; octagonal at the base, and\r\nspiral at the top: each side of the base measures one hundred and\r\nsixty-two feet; this immense breadth diminishes abruptly, and a similar\r\nbuilding has not unaptly been compared in shape to a large\r\nspeaking-trumpet. Six feet from the ground there is a wide projection\r\nthat surrounds the base, on the plane of which are fifty-seven small\r\nspires of equal size, and equidistant; one of them measured twenty-seven\r\nfeet in hight, and forty in circumference at the bottom. On a higher\r\nledge there is another row consisting of fifty-three spires of similar\r\nshape and measurement. A great variety of moldings encircle the\r\nbuilding; and ornaments somewhat resembling the _fleur de lis_ surround\r\nthe lower part of the spire: circular moldings likewise girt it to a\r\nconsiderable hight, above which there are ornaments in stucco not unlike\r\nthe leaves of a Corinthian capital; and the whole is crowned by a _tee_,\r\nor umbrella, of open iron-work, from which rises a rod with a gilded\r\npennant.\r\n\r\nThe tee or umbrella is to be seen on every sacred building that is of a\r\nspiral form. The raising and consecration of this last and indispensable\r\nappendage, is an act of high religious solemnity, and a season of\r\nfestivity and relaxation. The king himself bestowed the tee that covers\r\nthe Shoemadoo. It was made at the capital; and many of the principal\r\nnobility came down from Ummerapoora to be present at the ceremony of its\r\nelevation. The circumference of the tee is fifty-six feet; it rests on\r\nan iron axis fixed in the building, and is further secured by large\r\nchains strongly riveted to the spire. Round the lower rim of the tee are\r\nappended a number of bells, which, agitated by the wind, make a\r\ncontinual jingling. The tee is gilt, and it was said to be the intention\r\nof the king to gild the whole of the spire. All the lesser pagodas are\r\nornamented with proportionable umbrellas of similar workmanship, which\r\nare likewise encircled by small bells. The extreme hight of the edifice,\r\nfrom the level of the country, is three hundred and sixty-one feet, and\r\nabove the interior terrace, three hundred and thirty one feet.\r\n\r\nOn the south-east angle of the upper terrace there are two handsome\r\nsaloons, or _kioums_, the roofs of which are composed of different\r\nstages, supported by pillars. Mr. S. judged each to be about sixty feet\r\nin length, and in breadth thirty. The ceiling of one is embellished with\r\ngold leaf, and the pillars are lacquered; the decoration of the other is\r\nnot yet completed. They are made entirely of wood; and the carving on\r\nthe outside is laborious and minute. Mr. Symes saw several unfinished\r\nfigures of animals and men in grotesque attitudes, designed as ornaments\r\nfor different parts of the building. Some images of Gaudama, the supreme\r\nobject of Birman adoration, lay scattered around. At each angle of the\r\ninterior and higher terrace, there is a temple sixty-seven feet high,\r\nresembling, in miniature, the great temple: in front of that, in the\r\nsouth-west corner, are four gigantic representations, in masonry, of\r\nPalloo, or the evil genius, half beast, half human, seated on their\r\nhams, each with a large club on the right shoulder. The pundit who\r\naccompanied Mr. Symes, said that they resembled the Rakuss of the\r\nHindoos. These are guardians of the temple. Nearly in the center of the\r\neast face of the area are two human figures in stucco, beneath a gilded\r\numbrella. One, standing, represents a man with a book before him and a\r\npen in his hand: he is called Thasiamee, the recorder of mortal merits\r\nand mortal misdeeds. The other, a female figure kneeling, is\r\nMahasumdera, the protectress of the universe, so long as the universe is\r\ndoomed to last; but when the time of general dissolution arrives, by her\r\nhand the world is to be overwhelmed and everlastingly destroyed. A small\r\nbrick building near the north-east angle contains an upright marble\r\nslab, four feet high, and three feet wide: there was a long legible\r\ninscription on it. This, Mr. Symes was told, was an account of the\r\ndonations of pilgrims of only a recent date.\r\n\r\nAlong the whole extent of the north face of the upper terrace, there is\r\na wooden shed for the convenience of devotees who come from distant\r\nparts of the country. On the north side of the temple are three large\r\nbells of good workmanship, suspended near the ground, between pillars;\r\nseveral deers’ horns lie strewed around: those who come to pay their\r\ndevotions first take up one of the horns, and strike the bell three\r\ntimes, giving an alternate stroke to the ground: this act is to announce\r\nto the spirit of Gaudama the approach of a suppliant. There are several\r\nlow benches near the foot of the temple, on which the person who comes\r\nto pray, places his offering, commonly consisting of boiled rice, a\r\nplate of sweetmeats, or cocoa-nut fried in oil: when it is given, the\r\ndevotee cares not what becomes of it; the crows and wild dogs often\r\ndevour it in presence of the donor, who never attempts to disturb the\r\nanimals. Mr. Symes saw several plates of victuals disposed of in this\r\nmanner, and understood it to be the case with all that was brought.\r\n\r\nThere are many small temples on the areas of both terraces, which are\r\nneglected, and suffered to fall into decay. Numberless images of Gaudama\r\nlie indiscriminately scattered around. A pious Birman who purchases an\r\nidol, first procures the ceremony of consecration to be performed by the\r\nRhahaans; he then takes his purchase to whatever sacred building is most\r\nconvenient, and there places it in the shelter of a _kioum_, or on the\r\nopen ground before the temple; nor does he ever again seem to have any\r\nanxiety about its preservation, but leaves the divinity to shift for\r\nitself. Some of those idols are made of marble that is found in the\r\nneighborhood of the capital of the Birman dominions, which admits of a\r\nvery fine polish; many are formed of wood, and gilded, and a few are of\r\nsilver; the latter, however, are not usually exposed and neglected like\r\nthe others. Silver and gold are rarely used, except in the composition\r\nof household gods. On both the terraces are a number of white\r\ncylindrical flags, raised on bamboo poles; these flags are peculiar to\r\nthe Rhahaans, and are considered as emblematical of purity, and of their\r\nsacred function. On the top of the staff there is a _henza_ or goose,\r\nthe symbol both of the Birman and Pegu nations.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 COLOSSAL FIGURE OF JUPITER PLUVIUS, OR\r\n                         THE APENNINE JUPITER.\r\n\r\nStatues above the ordinary size, were named by the ancients, _colossi_,\r\nfrom a Greek word which signifies “members.” That at Rhodes was the most\r\nfamous, executed by Carelus, a pupil of Lysippus. There were several at\r\nRome; the most considerable was that of Vespasian, in the amphitheater,\r\nthat bore the name of Colisæa. Claudius caused a colossal statue of\r\nhimself to be raised on a rock exposed to the sea waves, in front of the\r\nport of Ostium. Nero had his person and figure painted on a linen cloth,\r\none hundred and twenty feet in hight. In the court of the Capitol, and\r\nin the palace Farnesi, &c., are colossi, either entire or mutilated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JUPITER PLUVIUS, OR THE APENNINE JUPITER.]\r\n\r\nThe colossal figure of Jupiter Pluvius is found at Pratolino, in Italy.\r\nThe space in which it stands is planted round, on all sides, with lofty\r\nfir and beech trees, the trunks of which are hid by a wood of laurel,\r\nwherein niches have been cut for statues. The middle part is a green\r\nlawn, and at a little distance, is a semicircular basin of water, behind\r\nwhich rises the colossal statue of the Apennine Jupiter. Enchased, as it\r\nwere, in the groves, it can only be surveyed in front, and from a point\r\nof view marked by the artist, in the adjoining engraving. Elevated on a\r\nbase to appearance irregular, and of itself lofty, at which the\r\nastonished spectator arrives through two balustrades that run round the\r\nbasin, this colossus, a view of which is given in the cut above, looks,\r\nat first, like a pyramidal rock, on which the hand of man might have\r\nexecuted some project analogous to what the statuary Stasicrates had\r\nconceived respecting Mount Athos,[10] and which Alexander nobly\r\nrejected. But soon he recognizes the genius of a pupil and worthy rival\r\nof Michael Angelo.\r\n\r\nFootnote 10:\r\n\r\n  Stasicrates proposed to Alexander to transform Mount Athos into a\r\n  durable statue of himself, and one that would be most prominent to a\r\n  world of beholders. His left hand to contain a city peopled with ten\r\n  thousand inhabitants, and from the right a great river to flow, its\r\n  waters descending to the sea. The proposition of this gigantesque\r\n  monument was rejected by Alexander, who, in reply to his proposal,\r\n  said, “The passage of Mount Caucasus, the Tanais, and the Caspian,\r\n  which I have forced, shall be my monuments.”\r\n\r\nIt was, in fact, John of Bologna, who, by an inspiration derived from\r\nthe ancients, executed their _beau ideal_ of Jupiter Pluvius. This name\r\nseems more suitable to the figure than that of Father Apennine, which\r\nhas been assigned to it. The style, in point of magnitude, is of the\r\nlargest, and the character of the head is in perfect conformity to the\r\nsubject. His brows and front brave the tempest, and seem the region of\r\nthe hoar-frost; his locks descend in icicles on his broad shoulders, and\r\nthe flakes of his immense beard resemble stalactites; his limbs seem\r\ncovered with hoar-frost, but with no alteration in their contour, or in\r\nthe form of the muscles. To add to the extraordinary effect, about the\r\nhead is a kind of crown, formed of little jetteaux, that drop on the\r\nshoulders and trickle down the figure, shedding a sort of supernatural\r\nluster, when irradiated by the sun.\r\n\r\nIt would be difficult to imagine a composition more picturesque and\r\nperfect in all its proportions. The figure harmonizes with the\r\nsurrounding objects, but its real magnitude is best shown by comparison\r\nwith the groups promenading about the water, and which in comparison, at\r\na certain distance, resemble pigmies. A nearer approach exhibits a truly\r\nstriking proportion of the limbs. A number of apartments have been\r\nfabricated in the interior, and within the head is a beautiful\r\nbelvedere, wherein the eyeballs serve for windows. The extremities are\r\nof stone; the trunk is of bricks overlaid with a mortar or cement that\r\nhas contracted the hardness of marble, and which, when fresh, it was\r\neasy to model in due forms.\r\n\r\nIt is related in the life of John of Bologna, that several of his\r\npupils, unaccustomed to work with the hand, while engaged in this work,\r\nforgot the correct standard of dimensions, both as to the eye and hand,\r\nand that Father Apennine and his enormous muscles made them spoil a\r\nnumber of statues. The greatest difficulty in the workmanship was to\r\nimpress on the mass, the character of monumental durability. The artist\r\nhas succeeded in uniting the rules of the statuary with those of\r\nconstruction, in combining the beauty of the one with the solidity of\r\nthe other. All the parts refer to a common center of gravity, and the\r\nmembers are arranged so as to serve for a scaffolding to the body,\r\nwithout impairing its dignity or magnitude. The colossal statues of the\r\nancients may have suggested the idea of this configuration, or as before\r\nhinted, the artist may have aimed to represent the Jupiter Pluvius.\r\nHowever, it seems probable that Poussin, in his painting of the plains\r\nof Sicily, has, from this, formed his Polyphemus, seated on the summit\r\nof a lofty rock. From the beauty of its proportions, and skill in the\r\nexecution, all artists who have to work on colossal figures, ought to\r\ncherish the preservation of this, as an imposing object, that can not be\r\ntoo profoundly studied.\r\n\r\n\r\n           THE LEANING, OR HANGING TOWER OF PISA, IN TUSCANY.\r\n\r\nThis celebrated tower, a view of which is given in the cut below,\r\nlikewise called the Campanile, on account of its having been erected for\r\nthe purpose of containing bells, stands in a square close to the\r\ncathedral of Pisa. It is built entirely of white marble, and is a\r\nbeautiful cylinder of eight stories, each adorned with a round of\r\ncolumns, rising one above another. It inclines so far on one side from\r\nthe perpendicular, that dropping a plummet from the top, which is one\r\nhundred and eighty-eight feet in hight, it falls sixteen feet from the\r\nbase. Much pains have been taken by connoisseurs to prove that this was\r\ndone purposely by the architect; but it is evident that the inclination\r\nhas proceeded from another cause, namely, from an accidental subsidence\r\nof the foundation on that side. The pillars are there considerably sunk;\r\nand this is also the case with the very threshold, which shows that the\r\nposition of the building is accidental, caused by the settling of the\r\nground on one side, and not, as some think, by the ambition of the\r\narchitect, endeavoring to show how far he could with safety deviate from\r\nthe perpendicular, and thus display a novel specimen of his art; for had\r\nthis been his design, he would have shortened the pilasters on that\r\nside, so as to exhibit them entire, without the appearance of sinking.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE LEANING TOWER AT PISA]\r\n\r\nThis tower, from its singular appearance and position, has attracted the\r\nnotice of all travelers passing near Pisa, who, of course, fail not to\r\nvisit it. We give the impressions of two of these: Professor Silliman,\r\nwho saw it in 1851; and Mr. Hillard, who was there at a still later\r\ndate. The former says, “This structure has excited so much surprise, and\r\nbeen seen with such deep interest by thousands of travelers for more\r\nthan six hundred years, that it is almost universally known, and it is\r\nnot difficult for one who has not seen it to form a clear and distinct\r\nconception of it. Still, on approaching the tower, you are strongly\r\nimpressed by its grandeur and beauty; and when you ascend it, you obtain\r\nan almost overwhelming conception of its majesty; although it is\r\nperfectly safe; and if you do not feel apprehension that it will fall,\r\nyou may not be able to keep that idea quite out of your mind. The hight\r\nof the leaning tower is one hundred and seventy-eight feet, the\r\nthickness of the wall ten feet, and the diameter is fifty feet at the\r\nbase. It is composed of eight stories, all adorned by columns and\r\narches. Its form is slightly conical. It is ascended by three hundred\r\nand thirty very easy steps, very well lighted, and it is a pleasant\r\njourney to the top. There are seven bells in this grand belfry; they\r\nwere rung while we were near, and the sound is very soft and musical,\r\nespecially of the great bell, which weighs twelve thousand pounds, and\r\nis placed upon the side of the tower, opposite to that which overhangs.\r\nIt was this bell which was formerly used to give notice of public\r\nexecutions. The leaning of the tower of Pisa was evidently caused by\r\nunequal subsidence of the ground; and it is obvious that the architect,\r\nas the work rose, before the tower was half up, perceived it, and he\r\nendeavored to counteract it as far as possible by balancing his\r\nmaterials. After a particular hight, the columns are higher on the\r\nleaning side, and, of course, shorter on the other. The builder appeared\r\nto be aiming to bring the upper part of the tower into a vertical\r\nposition, although he did not succeed. It is about thirteen or fourteen\r\nfeet beyond the vertical; but the center of gravity still falls within\r\nthe base; and as the blocks of stone, being now firmly united by cement,\r\ncan not slide upon each other, they, in fact, form one mass. The walls\r\nare, moreover, fortified by iron bars, and it is not probable that\r\nanything short of an earthquake can produce its downfall. I can not\r\nthink with some, that it requires strong nerves to ascend the leaning\r\ntower of Pisa. We ascended with a perfect consciousness of security, and\r\nit is certain that were it filled in every story by an armed host, it\r\nwould not quiver or vibrate. The view from the summit of the tower is\r\nmost splendid. The beautiful city is at your feet, and you are in the\r\nmidst of it. The Mediterranean is in the horizon, Leghorn is visible in\r\nthe distance, the Arno shows its windings, here and there, and a rich\r\nplain in full cultivation reaches far inland to the lofty Apennines, in\r\nthe vicinity of Lucca. It is said, that, in clear weather, Corsica may\r\nbe discerned. This tower is one of the most beautiful objects in Italy,\r\nand one would never be tired with looking at it or from it; so beautiful\r\nis it, that its leaning becomes a mere incident, interesting indeed, but\r\nthe tower possesses commanding attractions independently of this\r\ncircumstance. We can not descend from it without remembering that here\r\nGalileo made his decisive experiments upon the law of the descent of\r\nfalling bodies, and upon the vibration of the pendulum. His great name\r\nis associated with the permanent glory of his country, and will be\r\nhonored to the end of time, while his persecutors are remembered only to\r\nbe despised and detested.”\r\n\r\nMr. Hillard, the other tourist to whom we have alluded, says, “On a\r\nbright, sunny morning, I first saw the leaning tower of Pisa. This piece\r\nof architectural eccentricity was, and I suppose is, one of the\r\ncommon-places of geography, and is put into the same educational\r\nstate-room with the wall of China, the great tun of Heidelberg, and the\r\nnatural bridge of Virginia. I can not recall the time when its name was\r\nnot familiar to me; and now, here it was, bodily before me; no vision,\r\nno delusion, but a very decided fact, with a most undeniable inclination\r\non one side; so much so, that a nervous person would not sleep soundly\r\nin the house that stands under its lee, on a windy night. This singular\r\nstructure is simply a campanile, or bell-tower, appurtenant to the\r\ncathedral, as is the general custom in Italy. It is not merely quaint,\r\nbut beautiful; that is, take away the quaintness, and the beauty will\r\nremain. It is built of white marble, wonderfully fresh and pure, when we\r\nremember that nearly seven centuries have swept over it. I will not\r\ndescribe it, nor give its dimensions, for these may be found in every\r\nguide-book, and nearly every book of travels; nor will I condense the\r\narguments which have been called forth by the question, whether the\r\ninclination be accidental or designed. To one who has been on the spot,\r\nand observed the spongy nature of the soil, as evidenced by the slight\r\nsubsidence of the cathedral, there is really no room for argument or\r\ndoubt. The ascent is very easy and gradual. The summit is secured by\r\ndouble rails, and the inclination is less perceptible when on the top\r\nthan when it is observed from the ground. There is no peculiar sense of\r\ndanger to interfere with the full enjoyment of the beauty of the view,\r\nwhich embraces mountain and plain, land and sea; a combination at once\r\nvaried, extensive and picturesque. This was my first sight of the\r\nMediterranean, whose blue waters blended in the distant horizon with the\r\nblue of the sky. To the eye, it was but common water reflecting the\r\nuniversal sky; but a man must be very insensible, not to recognize\r\npeculiar elements in his first view of that many-nationed sea, upon\r\nwhose shores so much of the poetry and history of the world has grown.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                         THE COLISEUM AT ROME.\r\n\r\nOn approaching the majestic ruins of this vast amphitheater, the most\r\nstupendous work of the kind antiquity can boast, a sweet and gently\r\nmoving astonishment is the first sensation which seizes the beholder;\r\nand soon afterward the grand spectacle swims before him like a cloud. To\r\ngive an adequate idea of this sublime building, is a task to which the\r\npen is unequal: it must be seen to be duly appreciated. It is upward of\r\nsixteen hundred feet in circumference, and of such an elevation that it\r\nhas been justly observed by a writer, (Ammiamus,) “the human eye\r\nscarcely measures its hight.” Nearly the one-half of the external\r\ncircuit still remains, consisting of four tiers of arcades, adorned with\r\ncolumns of four orders, the Doric, Ionian, Corinthian, and composite.\r\nIts extent, as well as its elevation, may be estimated by the number of\r\nspectators it contained, amounting, according to some accounts, to\r\neighty thousand, and agreeably to others, to one hundred thousand.\r\n\r\nThirty thousand captive Jews are said to have been engaged by Vespasian,\r\nwhose name it occasionally bears, in the construction of this vast\r\nedifice; and they have not discredited their forefathers, the builders\r\nof Solomon’s temple, by the performance. It was not finished, however,\r\nuntil the reign of his son Titus, who, on the first day of its being\r\nopened, introduced into the arena not less than five thousand, or,\r\naccording to Dio Cassius, nine thousand wild beasts, between whom, and\r\nthe primitive Christians held captive by the Romans, combats were\r\nfought. At the conclusion of this cruel spectacle the whole place was\r\nput under water, and two fleets, named the Corcyrian and the Corinthian,\r\nrepresented a naval engagement. To render the vapor from such a\r\nmultitude of persons less noxious, sweet-scented water, and frequently\r\nwine mixed with saffron, was showered down from a grated work above, on\r\nthe heads of the spectators.\r\n\r\nThe Roman emperors who succeeded Titus were careful of the preservation\r\nof this superb edifice: even the voluptuous Heliogabalus caused it to be\r\nrepaired after a great fire. The rude Goths, who sacked the city of\r\nRome, were contented with despoiling it of its internal ornaments, but\r\nrespected the structure itself. The Christians, however, through an\r\nexcess of zeal, have not been satisfied with allowing it gradually to\r\ndecay. Pope Paul II. had as much of it leveled as was necessary to\r\nfurnish materials for building the palace of St. Mark, and his\r\npernicious example was imitated by Cardinal Riario, in the construction\r\nof what is now called the Chancery. Lastly, a portion of it was employed\r\nby Pope Paul III. in the erection of the palace Farnese. Notwithstanding\r\nall these dilapidations, there still exists enough of it to inspire the\r\nspectator with awe. Immense masses appear fastened to and upon one\r\nanother without any mortar or cement; and these alone, from their\r\nstructure, are calculated for a duration of many thousands of years.\r\nOccasionally, where the destroyers have not effectually attained their\r\nobject, the half-loosened masses appear to be holden in the air, as if\r\nby some invisible power; for the wide interstices among them leave no\r\nother support than their joints, which seem every moment as if about to\r\nyield unavoidably to the superior force of gravitation. “They will\r\nfall;” “they must fall;” “they are falling;” is, and has been the\r\nlanguage of all beholders during the vast periods through which this\r\nstupendous edifice has thus hung together in the air.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE COLISEUM AT ROME.]\r\n\r\nSilliman, speaking of the Coliseum, says, “It is the most magnificent\r\nand imposing monument of ancient Rome. After all the spoliation it has\r\nsuffered for many centuries, by which two-thirds of its materials have\r\nbeen plundered, to build palaces and other structures, it still stands a\r\nstupendous ruin, solemn, awful, and even in desolation beautiful. Its\r\nposition is very near to the forum, and we pass to it through the arch\r\nof Titus. We felicitate ourselves that we saw the almost perfect\r\namphitheater at Nismes, as from that, and even from the less perfect one\r\nat Arles, we obtained those strong and correct impressions, which have\r\nenabled us more justly to appreciate the gigantic ruin, which still\r\ntowers in venerable majesty, above both the Rome of the Cæsars, and the\r\nRome of the popes. The Coliseum was begun A. D. 73, by Vespasian, and\r\nfinished by Titus, A. D. 80, ten years after the conquest of Jerusalem.\r\nChurch tradition states that its architect was Gaudentius, a Christian\r\nmartyr, and that some twelve thousand captive Jews and Christians were\r\nemployed in its construction. It is built chiefly of travertine,\r\nalthough there are large quantities of bricks and tufa in the structure.\r\nIts form is elliptical: there are four stories adorned by columns: the\r\nlower is Doric, thirty feet high: the second is Ionic, thirty-three feet\r\nhigh; the third, Corinthian, fifty-four feet, and above this, was the\r\nfrieze and cornice. The hight of the outer wall was one hundred and\r\nfifty-seven English feet. The longer axis, walls included, was six\r\nhundred and twenty feet; the shorter, five hundred and thirteen;\r\ncircumference, seventeen hundred and seventy feet; the arena, two\r\nhundred and eighty-seven feet long and a hundred and eighty feet broad.\r\nThe superficial area was nearly six acres. The arches were numbered,\r\nexternally, from one to eighty. One arch is not numbered, and this is\r\nbelieved to have been the private entrance of the emperor. There were,\r\nwithin the amphitheater, four groups of seats, corresponding, as at\r\nNismes, to the different orders of people. The seats could receive\r\neighty-seven thousand persons, or one hundred and ten thousand,\r\nincluding those who stood. The interior has been very much despoiled,\r\nand the seats are almost ruined; but a staircase has been constructed,\r\nby which we ascended securely to the top of the building, and enjoyed a\r\ngrand view, not only by day, but by a full moon. Byron’s splendid\r\ndescription in Manfred, does it no more than justice.”\r\n\r\nThe building, as may be seen in the cut on the preceding page, is much\r\ndecayed; and it is, also, “deformed by innumerable holes on the outside,\r\nbelieved to have been produced by the extraction of the dowels of\r\nbronze, which were originally placed in the joints to keep the stones in\r\nplace. At the dedication of the amphitheater by Titus, five thousand, or\r\naccording to some, nine thousand wild beasts were slaughtered, and the\r\nsavage exhibition went on during one hundred days. On the occasion of\r\nthe triumph of Trajan over the Dacians, the shows were continued one\r\nhundred and twenty-three days; eleven thousand animals were slain, and\r\none thousand gladiators matched against each other. Besides malefactors,\r\ncaptives and slaves, freeborn citizens, even those of noble birth, hired\r\nthemselves as gladiators; and women volunteered on the arena, to exhibit\r\ntheir skill in murder. The barbarous gladiatorial games were continued\r\nduring four hundred years; the last show of the wild beasts was under\r\nTheodoric, and these brutal entertainments were abolished by Honorius.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                             THE PANTHEON.\r\n\r\nThe Pantheon, says a late tourist, “is the most perfect, as a whole, of\r\nall the structures which have come down to us from ancient Rome. The\r\ninvasion of time alone would not have injured it materially, and,\r\nnotwithstanding the spoliations of popes and other depredators, it still\r\nremains a grand and beautiful building. It stands in a dirty,\r\ndisagreeable herb market, and the accumulations of earth and rubbish\r\nhave almost entirely covered its lofty steps, which were seven in\r\nnumber, until its floor is now nearly on a level with the street. Its\r\ndome was covered with gilt bronze, and its portico lined with the same\r\nmetal, which was plundered to be cast for the pillars and other parts of\r\nthe _baldacchino_ in St. Peter’s. On this occasion, four hundred and\r\nfifty thousand pounds were taken. The emperor Constans II. had\r\npreviously, in 657, stripped the roof, and plundered the silver from the\r\ninterior of the dome. He destined these things for the ornament of his\r\nimperial palace at Constantinople; but being murdered at Syracuse, on\r\nhis return, the plunder was borne to Alexandria. It was, originally, the\r\nspoils of Egypt after the battle of Actium, and now returned to Egypt\r\nagain. The external facings of polished marble, have also been torn off;\r\nbut although thus despoiled, the Pantheon is still magnificent,\r\nnotwithstanding that the fires have often heated it, the overflowing\r\nTiber has deluged its floor, and the rains have poured in at the only\r\nopening, which is in the dome. This is a circular hole in the center of\r\nthe dome, twenty-eight feet in diameter, and is said to have been once\r\nglazed. The rich marble facings and magnificent columns of the interior,\r\nstill remain. The beautiful columns are of polished granite and\r\nporphyry. The niches, originally filled by the statues of the pagan\r\ngods, have not been disturbed; but they are now occupied by saints, and\r\nvirgins, and other symbols of Catholic worship. The interior is one vast\r\nroom, one hundred and forty-three feet in diameter, exclusive of the\r\nwalls, which are twenty feet thick, and it is of the same hight, one\r\nhundred and forty-three feet: the dome occupies one-half of the hight.\r\nIt is not inaptly illustrated by the rotunda of the Capitol at\r\nWashington, which, although smaller, is of the same form. When in the\r\nRoman Pantheon, you look up to its sky-lighted dome, there is an\r\nimpression of simple grandeur which even St. Peter’s does not produce:\r\n\r\n             “‘Simple, erect, severe, austere, sublime—\r\n             Shrine of all saints, and temple of all gods.’\r\n\r\n“An inscription on the frieze records that the Pantheon was erected by\r\nAgrippa, B. C. _anno_ 26; and another inscription on the architrave\r\nrecords its subsequent restoration by Septimius Severus. In 608,\r\nBoniface obtained from the emperor Phocas permission to consecrate the\r\nPantheon as a Christian church, which, doubtless, saved it from\r\ndestruction. How much is it to be regretted that a similar protection\r\nhad not saved the Coliseum and other precious works, whose ruins bear\r\ntestimony to the misdirected zeal of the Christian church in early ages.\r\nThe portico is one hundred and ten feet long and forty-four deep. It\r\ncontains sixteen Corinthian monolithic columns of oriental granite,\r\nforty six and one-half feet high and five feet in diameter, with\r\ncapitals and bases of Greek marble. The pediment still shows where the\r\nfigures in bass-relief were attached.\r\n\r\n“The magnificent bronze doors are thirty-nine feet high, and the entire\r\nopening is nineteen wide. It is believed that they are the original\r\ndoors erected by Agrippa. No doubt they would have been used for the\r\ndecoration of St. Peter’s, had not the Pantheon been consecrated as a\r\nchurch. The interior cornice at the bottom of the dome has been\r\nperfectly preserved, with its rich sculptures. The pavement of the\r\nPantheon is of porphyry, alternating with other polished stones in\r\ngeometric figures. Some antiquarians have argued that the Pantheon was\r\noriginally an appendage of the baths of Agrippa, and that the portico\r\nwas of subsequent construction, when the building was converted into a\r\ntemple. However this may be, it is one of the most interesting\r\nstructures of ancient or modern times; and had it not been most\r\nshamefully robbed it would have stood to-day perfect in beauty as it was\r\nwhen Christ died, and when Paul preached and suffered in Rome. We bent\r\nwith deep interest over the grave of Raphael, whose remains still\r\nslumber beneath the pavement of the Pantheon, marked only by a humble\r\nslab of marble level with the floor. It is well known that until 1833\r\nhis place of interment was only matter of conjecture; in that year,\r\nowing to unexpected evidence, the present grave was opened in presence\r\nof the pope and numerous artists. The skull was of a singularly fine\r\nform; and its discovery spoiled the speculations of the phrenologists on\r\nanother skull in the academy of St. Luke’s, which had before been\r\nsupposed to be that of the great painter.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                     ROMAN AMPHITHEATER AT NISMES.\r\n\r\nNismes, anciently Nemausis, was formerly a flourishing colony of Romans,\r\nestablished by Augustus Cæsar, after the battle of Actium. Among its\r\nsplendid monuments of antiquity, the amphitheater, being infinitely\r\nbetter preserved than those of Rome and Verona, is the finest monument\r\nof the kind now extant. It was built in the reign of Antonius Pius, who\r\ncontributed a large sum of money toward its erection. It is of an oval\r\nfigure, one thousand and eighty feet in circumference, sufficiently\r\ncapacious to contain twenty thousand spectators. The architecture is of\r\nthe Tuscan order, sixty feet high, composed of two open galleries, built\r\none over another, consisting each of sixty arcades. The entrance into\r\nthe arena was by four great gates, with porticos; and the seats, of\r\nwhich there were thirty-two rows, sufficient to contain some twenty-five\r\nthousand people, rising one above another, consisted of great blocks of\r\nstone, many of which still remain. Over the north gate, appear two\r\nbulls, in alto-relievo, extremely well executed, emblems which,\r\naccording to the usage of the Romans, signified that the amphitheater\r\nwas erected at the expense of the people. In other parts are heads,\r\nbusts, and other sculptures in bass-relief.\r\n\r\nThis magnificent structure stands in the lower part of the city, and\r\nstrikes the spectator with awe and veneration. The external architecture\r\nis almost entire in its whole circuit. It was fortified as a citadel by\r\nthe Visigoths, in the beginning of the sixth century: they raised within\r\nit a castle, two towers of which are still extant, and surrounded it\r\nwith a broad and deep moat, which was filled up in the thirteenth\r\ncentury. In all the subsequent wars to which the city of Nismes was\r\nexposed, it served as the last refuge of the citizens, and sustained a\r\ngreat number of successive attacks; so that its fine preservation is\r\nalmost miraculous.\r\n\r\nSilliman says of this amphitheater, that it gives a very exact idea of\r\nthe Coliseum at Rome, though it is of course smaller. “It is built,” he\r\nadds, “of limestone in immense blocks, laid in courses with perfect\r\nregularity and without mortar. Mortise holes in the center of the upper\r\nsurface of each block show that the Romans employed the same means still\r\nin use, to raise and handle large masses of stone. The accuracy of the\r\nmasonry seems the more remarkable if we consider the elliptical form of\r\nthe structure, making all the vertical joints converge to the foci of\r\nthe ellipse. In one place we saw a line of light through a joint of this\r\nsort where the wall was at least four feet thick. The passages, of\r\ncourse, all expand outward also, and thus admit of a speedy evacuation\r\nof the amphitheater through its sixty _vomitoriæ_. The dimensions of\r\nthis ellipse are four hundred and thirty-seven by three hundred and\r\ntwenty-two feet. By walking deliberately around the structure, these\r\ndimensions are more readily realized than by a numerical statement: the\r\ncircuit is a quarter of a mile. The cornice was decorated with carving\r\nand finished with a frieze; except in the portion corresponding to nine\r\nor ten arches, the capping and cornice are complete around the entire\r\ncircuit. In the part where the cornice is deficient, the Saracens, more\r\nthan eleven hundred years ago, erected two towers, which were destroyed\r\nby Charles Martel, and fire applied by him disfigured the amphitheater.\r\nAs it was all of stone he could not destroy it, but the wood placed in\r\nits arches and corridors burned as in a furnace. He wished to destroy\r\nthe building, which had often been used as a fortress in the numerous\r\nwars that followed the downfall of the Roman empire. He succeeded only\r\nin blackening it with smoke which remains to this day. The heat,\r\nhowever, caused some portions of the limestone to flake off; but very\r\nlittle progress was made toward the destruction of the amphitheater. The\r\nbuilding is national property, and the French government has restored\r\nmany of the arches, laid anew the pavements, and has taken precautions\r\nto guard against further dilapidation. The exterior of the building is,\r\nindeed, somewhat corroded by time, but had war and violence been\r\nrestrained, this noble monument of antiquity would have remained, an\r\narchitectural wonder to all future ages. Many of the rows of marble\r\nseats remain entire, and enable the observer perfectly to understand the\r\nwhole arrangement. The emperor and his household entered by a lower and\r\nspecial corridor, and the vestal virgins by a corresponding opening on\r\nthe opposite side. The senators and patricians entered higher up, while\r\nthe plebeians, entering still higher, occupied the more elevated\r\npositions, and the slaves the uppermost of all. The police also had\r\ntheir appointed place.\r\n\r\n“Projecting outward from the cornice at regular intervals were stones,\r\npierced with holes six inches or more in diameter, through which passed\r\npoles to sustain the awning, the lower ends of the poles being sustained\r\nby corbel stones projecting from the wall below. The amphitheater had no\r\nother covering but the awning, and this, on occasions of the use of the\r\nbuilding for public games, was stretched upon ropes crossing from side\r\nto side of the arena. This covering secured the spectators from sun and\r\nrain, while it permitted free ventilation. The gladiators entered on one\r\nside of the arena and the wild beasts on the other, and probably the\r\nsame rule prevailed when gladiator was to contend with gladiator. Here\r\nman fought his fellow-man, or with the fierce wild beast, to pamper the\r\ncruel appetite for blood. Strange feelings of awe and grandeur are\r\nexcited by seeing the vast space which was so often filled with human\r\nbeings, and one’s mind runs wild with excitement when he sees in\r\nimagination, the lion’s eye glancing at the grating until he was\r\nenlarged to spring upon his victim. The weeds and grass now grow among\r\nthe seats, and green-sward covers the once ensanguined arena. The little\r\nlizards leap from stone to stone, and their brief generations are now\r\nthe sole tenants of these ancient piles.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                            TRAJAN’S PILLAR.\r\n\r\nThis historical column was erected at Rome by the emperor Trajan to\r\ncommemorate his victories over the Dacians, and is considered the\r\nmasterpiece of the splendid monuments of art elevated by that emperor in\r\nthe Roman capital. Its celebrity is chiefly owing to the beautifully\r\nwrought bass-reliefs, containing about two thousand figures, with which\r\nit is ornamented. It stands in the middle of a square, to form which, a\r\nhill, one hundred and forty feet in hight, was leveled; and was\r\nintended, as appears by the inscription on its base, both as a tomb for\r\nthe emperor, and to display the hight of the hill, which had thus with\r\nincredible labor, been reduced to a plane surface. It was erected in the\r\nyear 114 of the Christian era; and the emperor Constantine, two\r\ncenturies and a half afterward, regarded it as the most magnificent\r\nstructure by which Rome was even at that time embellished. This pillar\r\nis built of white marble, its base consisting of twelve stones of\r\nenormous size, being raised on a socle, or foot of eight steps; and\r\nwithin it is a staircase illuminated by forty-four windows. Its hight,\r\nequaling that of the hill which had been leveled, to give place to the\r\nlarge square called the _Forum Romanum_, is one hundred and forty feet,\r\nbeing thirty-five feet less elevated than the Antonine column.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          COLUMN OF ANTONINE.\r\n\r\nThis grand column is one of the most conspicuous monuments of ancient\r\nRome. It is near the present post-office, in a busy, populous square—the\r\nPiazza Colonna—in the midst of the modern city. The hight of the column\r\nof Antonine is one hundred and sixty-eight feet; diameter, eleven and\r\none-half; the pedestal is twenty-five feet and eight inches high. It was\r\nerected by the senate and people of Rome to Marcus Aurelius Antoninus,\r\nA. D. 174. Bass-reliefs, as in Trajan’s column, run spirally around the\r\nmonument, representing military movements and victories. One of the\r\nreliefs represents Jupiter as dropping rain from his extended arms. This\r\nhas been supposed to allude to the effect attributed to the prayers of\r\nthe Christian legion from Mytilene, in the army of the emperor, who, at\r\nhis request, prayed for rain when there was a great drought. The column\r\nis composed of pieces of white marble, and in the interior are one\r\nhundred and ninety steps lighted by forty-two loopholes. By a strange\r\nincongruity, a statue of St. Paul, ten feet high, has been made to\r\nreplace the emperor on the top of the column. This was done by Sixtus V.\r\nIt is said that the drawn sword which the apostle holds in his hand\r\nproves a conductor to the lightning, and that the column has been\r\nseveral times injured.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        MAISON CARRE, AT NISMES.\r\n\r\nIf the amphitheater of Nismes strikes the spectator with an idea of\r\ngreatness and sublimity, the Maison Carré enchants him with the most\r\nexquisite beauties of architecture and sculpture. This fine structure,\r\nas is evidenced by the inscription discovered on its front, was built by\r\nthe inhabitants of Nismes, in honor of Caius Cæsar, and Lucius Cæsar,\r\ngrandchildren of Augustus, by his daughter Julia, the wife of Agrippa.\r\nIt stands upon a pediment six feet high, is eighty-two feet long,\r\nthirty-five broad, and thirty-seven in hight, without reckoning the\r\npediment. The body of it is adorned with twenty columns engaged in the\r\nwall; and the peristyle, which is open, with ten detached pillars that\r\nsupport the entablature. They are all of the Corinthian order, fluted\r\nand embellished with capitals of the most exquisite sculpture: the\r\nfrieze and cornice are much admired, and the foliage is esteemed\r\ninimitable. The proportions of the building are so happily blended, as\r\nto give it an air of majesty and grandeur, which the most indifferent\r\nspectator can not behold without emotion. To enjoy these beauties, it is\r\nnot necessary to be a connoisseur in architecture: they are indeed so\r\nexquisite that they may be visited with a fresh appetite for years\r\ntogether. What renders them still more interesting is, that they are\r\nentire, and very little affected, either by the ravages of time, or the\r\nhavoc of war. Cardinal Alberoni declared this elegant structure to be a\r\njewel which deserved a cover of gold to preserve it from external\r\ninjuries. An Italian painter, perceiving a small part of the roof\r\nrepaired by modern French masonry, tore his hair, and exclaimed in a\r\nrage, “Zounds! what do I see? Harlequin’s hat on the head of Augustus!”\r\nIn its general architectural effect, as well as in all its details of\r\nsculpture and ornament, the Maison Carré of Nismes is ravishingly\r\nbeautiful, and can not be paralleled by any structure of ancient or\r\nmodern times. That which most excites the astonishment of the admiring\r\nspectator, is to see it standing entire, like the effect of enchantment,\r\nafter such a succession of ages, subjected as several of them were, to\r\nthe ravages of the barbarians who overran the most interesting parts of\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nIn the progress of many centuries, the Maison Carré has been used as a\r\nChristian church, and also for many ordinary purposes, some of them of\r\nthe lowest character. The fine Corinthian columns of this building have\r\nbeen much corroded by time, and two that were contiguous, were mutilated\r\nin the flutings to make more room for the passage of a farmer’s cart\r\nwhen the temple was used as a barn or stable; and, to afford more\r\naccommodations, walls were built up between the columns of the portico.\r\nIn the eleventh century it was used as town-house, or _hôtel de ville_.\r\nWhen attached to the Augustine convent it was employed as a sepulcher;\r\nand in the days of terror, the revolutionary tribunal held its meetings\r\nhere. The building is at present occupied as a museum. It contains many\r\ninteresting objects, especially Roman antiquities: the pictures are not\r\nremarkable. There is in it a beautiful mosaic pavement taken up entire\r\nfrom a Roman house. This temple is supposed to have been only the center\r\nof a much larger building, extending with wings and long colonnades to\r\nthe right and left, whose foundations have been discovered.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           THE PONT DU GARD.\r\n\r\nThis celebrated Roman monument is distant about three leagues from the\r\ncity of Nismes. Instead of finding it in a ruinous condition, as he\r\nmight reasonably have expected, the traveler, on approaching it, is\r\nagreeably disappointed when he perceives that it looks as fresh as a\r\nmodern bridge of a few years’ standing. The climate is either so pure\r\nand dry, or the freestone with which it is built is so hard, that the\r\nvery angles of the stones remain as acute as if they had been recently\r\ncut. A few of them have, indeed, dropped out of the arches; but the\r\nwhole is admirably preserved, and presents the eye with a piece of\r\narchitecture, so unaffectedly elegant, so simple, and, at the same time,\r\nso majestic, that it defies the most phlegmatic spectator to view it\r\nwithout admiration. It was raised in the Augustan age, by the Roman\r\ncolony of Nismes, to convey a stream of water between two mountains, for\r\nthe use of that city. By means of it the arena of the amphitheater could\r\nbe flooded for the _naumachiæ_. It stands over the river Gardon, a\r\nbeautiful pastoral stream, brawling among rocks which form a number of\r\npretty natural cascades, and overshadowed on each side by trees and\r\nshrubs, which add greatly to the rural beauties of the scene.\r\n\r\nThis elegant structure consists of three bridges, or tiers of arches,\r\none above another; the first of six, the second of eleven, and the third\r\nof thirty-six arches. The hight, comprehending the aqueduct on the top,\r\nis one hundred and seventy-four feet and three inches, and the length,\r\nbetween the two mountains, which it unites, is seven hundred and\r\ntwenty-three feet. The order of the architecture is Tuscan; but its\r\nsymmetry is inconceivable. By scooping the bases of the pilasters of the\r\nsecond tier of arches, a passage was made for foot-travelers; but\r\nalthough the ancients far excelled the moderns in point of beauty and\r\nmagnificence, they certainly fell short of them in point of convenience.\r\nThe inhabitants of Avignon have, in this particular, improved the Roman\r\nwork by a new bridge by apposition, constructed on the same plan with\r\nthat of the lower tier of arches, of which indeed it seems to be a part,\r\naffording a broad and commodious passage over the river, to horses and\r\ncarriages. The aqueduct for the continuance of which this superb work\r\nwas raised, conveyed a stream of pure water from the fountain of Eure,\r\nnear the city of Uzes, and extended nearly six leagues in length.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ANCIENT ROMAN AQUEDUCT.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                      ANCIENT AQUEDUCT NEAR ROME.\r\n\r\nIn this connection, we may notice an ancient Roman aqueduct, the arches\r\nof which may still be seen by the tourist as he approaches the “eternal\r\ncity;” and a view of which is given in the cut on the next page. It\r\nreminds us, in its general outlines, of the Pont du Gard which has just\r\nbeen described, except that the latter has three tiers of arches while\r\nthis has but two; and the styles of architecture in the two are\r\ndifferent. These immense structures, carried for miles over valleys and\r\nthrough hills, were reared by the ancients at the cost of vast expense\r\nand labor, that they might supply themselves with pure water for\r\ndomestic and public uses. And their ruins still bear witness to the\r\ngigantic scale on which such works were planned and completed, at an age\r\nand among a people that we are accustomed to think of as far inferior to\r\nour own.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            THE ROMAN FORUM.\r\n\r\nThere has been much discussion as to the form and extent of the Roman\r\nforum, and as to the use of some of the structures whose ruins are found\r\nwithin its area. Sometimes the word _forum_ was applied to\r\nmarket-places—_forum boarium_, _fora venalia_, as well as to places\r\nwhere justice was administered, _fora civilia_. The great Roman Forum at\r\nthe foot of the Capitol, and contiguous to the Palatine hill, was, no\r\ndoubt, intended by Romulus for the assemblies of the people. It was\r\nadorned with an immense number of Grecian statues, among which were\r\ntwelve gilt statues of the principal gods. Numerous relics of its former\r\ngrandeur now fill the _campo vaccino_—broken porticos, ruined arches,\r\nsingle columns, and the remains of temples. To each of these belongs a\r\nstory of curious antiquarian research. Without wishing to follow the\r\nbeaten path of all travelers, it is impossible to pass these\r\nworld-renowned memorials of a by-gone age without some brief notice. One\r\nof these is\r\n\r\n\r\n                          THE ARCH OF SEVERUS.\r\n\r\nThe arch of Septimius Severus stands in the Forum, on the eastern front\r\nof the Capitol. The soil and rubbish there accumulated was fifteen feet\r\ndeep, but the ground was excavated under Napoleon, and the whole of this\r\nfine monument was thus brought into view. It was erected A. D. 205, by\r\nthe senate and people of Rome, in honor of the emperor and his sons, on\r\naccount of their conquests of the Parthians and Persians. This is\r\nrecorded upon the monument, in an inscription which is still perfectly\r\nlegible. The monument was constructed entirely of Grecian marble. There\r\nis a large and lofty middle arch, and there are two lateral arches. In\r\none of the columns is a staircase of fifty steps, leading to the top, on\r\nwhich there was originally a car drawn by six horses, containing the\r\nfigures of the emperor and of his two sons, Geta and Caracalla. Geta was\r\nmurdered by his brother, and the inscription which alluded to both was\r\nmutilated by Caracalla, so as to leave out the name of Geta; this\r\nobliteration is obvious on inspection. There are on the panels many\r\nfigures in high relief, representing deeds of war, in which the Romans\r\nso much delighted.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           THE ARCH OF TITUS.\r\n\r\nThis, which is one of the most beautiful of the Roman arches, and a view\r\nof which is given in the cut on the next page, was erected to\r\ncommemorate the conquest of Jerusalem by Titus. It stands at the eastern\r\nend of the Forum, and the _via sacra_ passes beneath it. It is built of\r\nGrecian marble, and has only a single arch, with fluted columns on each\r\nside. On the side toward the Forum there is a mutilated figure of\r\nVictory standing over the arch. The side toward the Coliseum is the most\r\nperfect; and nearly all the cornice and the antæ are preserved. This\r\narch has a peculiar interest attached to it, because it illustrates\r\nScripture history. On one of the bass-reliefs, inside of the arch, a\r\nprocession are bearing the spoils of the temple—the golden candlestick\r\nand the silver trumpets—the only authentic representations of those\r\nsacred objects, and perfectly corresponding with the description given\r\nby Josephus. The seven-branched candlestick itself was lost in the\r\nTiber, and now reposes amidst its yellow sands.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE ARCH OF TITUS.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                              THE CAPITOL.\r\n\r\nThe modern Capitol is erected on the foundation of the ancient. The huge\r\nblocks of peperino stone which underlie the present Capitol rise from\r\nthe area of the Forum, far below; and it is quite obvious that the\r\nmodern structure is superimposed. The Capitol hill is the highest ground\r\nin old Rome; and the summit of its tower is, as already observed, higher\r\nthan any other building in Rome east of the Tiber. We ascend to the\r\npresent Capitol from the west, by a series of marble steps. On the right\r\nand left, at the top of the stairs, are antique equestrian and colossal\r\nstatues of Castor and Pollux, mounted upon high pedestals. In the middle\r\nof the area, in front of the Capitol, is the colossal equestrian statue\r\nbelieved to be that of Marcus Aurelius. It is in bronze, and is a most\r\nnoble specimen of ancient art. The emperor is truly imperial, and the\r\nhorse is admirable; it can not be exceeded in symmetry and grandeur.\r\nThis statue, had it not been mistaken for a statue of Constantine, would\r\nhave shared the fate of other productions of pagan art. It was\r\noriginally gilded, and the gold is still visible upon it here and there.\r\nThe head and neck of the horse are copied by modern sculptors, as being\r\nthe best specimens of the form of this part of the noble animal in\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       THE MUSEUM OF THE CAPITOL.\r\n\r\nThis museum is situated in two wings, on the right and left of the\r\nCapitoline hill. They do not form a part of the same structure. It is\r\nexceedingly instructive, as the statues are very numerous; and we can\r\nnot doubt that they exhibit faithfully the persons of the ancient\r\nRomans, with their features and costumes. Many of the most distinguished\r\nRoman emperors, poets, historians, and orators, are represented in\r\nmarble or bronze; Trajan, Caligula, Hadrian, Nero, Nerva, Julius Cæsar\r\nand his murderer Brutus, Cicero, Virgil, Caracalla, and a multitude\r\nmore. Some of the statues are colossal. There are several parts of an\r\nimmense statue of Nero, which was designed to be one hundred and fifty\r\nfeet high, and to rival in altitude the Coliseum itself. In crime and\r\ninfamy, he was indeed a colossus. His countenance has a groveling,\r\nanimal expression, very strongly marked in a bust contained in a private\r\nmuseum, where, as if to correspond with the blackness of his character,\r\nhe is sculptured in basalt, or black marble.\r\n\r\n“We saw in the museum of the Capitol,” says Professor Silliman, “the\r\noriginal of that bust of Cicero, which represents him as a large man\r\nwith a full face and round head, the very reverse of the bust formerly\r\nsaid to be Cicero’s, and which I saw in 1805 in the Earl of Pembroke’s\r\npalace, near Salisbury, England. That bust made Cicero’s features lean,\r\nmuscular, and sharp, with a wart on the right cheek, near the nose.\r\nArtists and antiquaries have no doubt, I believe, of the authenticity of\r\nthe bust in the Capitol, which bears his name, and was found in a villa\r\nof Mecænas. An excellent copy of this bust, by our countryman, Crawford,\r\nis in the Trumbull gallery in Yale college, along with copies by the\r\nsame artist of the busts of Demosthenes and Homer, the originals of\r\nwhich we saw in the Capitol museum. In this museum is also to be seen\r\nthe celebrated Venus of the Capitol, to which a separate saloon is\r\ndevoted. The dying Gladiator is in a room with other noble antique\r\nstatues. Byron has completely embalmed this figure in his memorable\r\ndescription in the fifth canto of Childe Harold’s pilgrimage. It is\r\nprobable that the artist himself, could he have read the passage, would\r\nhave confessed that it expressed his sentiment even more perfectly than\r\nthe marble. Any one who has traversed Italy with Byron in his hand, will\r\nreadily appreciate not only the wonderful fidelity of his descriptions,\r\nbut that all other language seems poverty-stricken and unmeaning when\r\ncompared with the masterly touches by which he has painted the various\r\nmonuments of antiquity which adorn his pictured page. For example,\r\nbesides the passage just alluded to, we have his tomb of Cecilia\r\nMetella, the Thunder-stricken Nurse of Rome! the Coliseum, the Pantheon,\r\nand St. Peter’s, &c. The original bronze wolf, representing the early\r\nnursing of Romulus and Remus, is in the Capitol museum. The little\r\nurchins, also in bronze, are eagerly drawing from the savage wet-nurse\r\nthe means of life. This fable affords not an unapt symbol of the\r\nferocious disposition of Romulus, who slew his brother, and of most of\r\nthe Roman people, of whatever rank, to whom human blood seems to have\r\nbeen a delightful nectar. There has been much discussion as to the\r\nantiquity of this wolf. It appears probable that this is the image\r\nreferred to by Cicero; and it bears marks of having been struck by\r\nlightning, according to tradition. There is a large piece of metal torn\r\nout of one of the hind legs of the wolf, and this is stated by tradition\r\nto have happened from a thunder-stroke, (to which, of course, Byron\r\nalludes in his immortal lines,) which fell upon the wolf the moment when\r\nit was announced in the Capitol that Julius Cæsar was dead.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                          ST. PETER’S OF ROME.\r\n\r\nThe piazza of this masterpiece of architecture, a view of which as seen\r\nfrom the Tiber is given in the cut on the next page, is altogether\r\nsublime. The double colonnade on each side, extending in a semicircular\r\nsweep, the stupendous Egyptian obelisk, the two fountains, the portico,\r\nand the admirable façade of the church, form such an assemblage of\r\nmagnificent objects, as can not fail to impress the mind with awe and\r\nadmiration. The church appears in the background, and on each side is a\r\nrow of quadruple arches, resting on two hundred and eighty-four pillars,\r\nand eighty-eight pilasters: these arches support one hundred and\r\nninety-two statues, twelve feet in hight. The two noble fountains throw\r\na mass of water to the hight of nine feet, from which it falls in a very\r\npicturesque manner, and adds greatly to the beauty of the scene. In the\r\ncenter is the fine obelisk.\r\n\r\nAt the first entrance into St. Peter’s, the effect is not so striking as\r\nmight be expected: it enlarges itself, however, insensibly on all sides,\r\nand improves on the eye every moment. The proportions are so accurately\r\nobserved, that each of the parts are seen to an equal advantage, without\r\ndistinguishing itself above the rest. It appears neither extremely high,\r\nnor long, nor broad, because a just equality is preserved throughout.\r\nAlthough every object in this church is admirable, the most astonishing\r\npart of it is the cupola. On ascending to it, the spectator is surprised\r\nto find, that the dome which he sees in the church, is not the same with\r\nthe one he had examined without doors, the latter being a kind of case\r\nto the other, and the stairs by which he ascends into the ball lying\r\nbetween the two. Had there been the outward dome only, it would not have\r\nbeen seen to advantage by those who are within the church; or had there\r\nbeen the inward one only, it would scarcely have been seen by those who\r\nare without; and had both been one solid dome of so great a thickness,\r\nthe pillars would have been too weak to have supported it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ST. PETER’S AS SEEN FROM THE TIBER.]\r\n\r\nIt is not easy to conceive a more glorious architectural display than\r\nthe one which presents itself to the spectator who stands beneath the\r\ndome. If he looks upward, he is astonished at the spacious hollow of the\r\ncupola, and has a vault on every side of him, which makes one of the\r\nmost beautiful vistas the eye can possibly have to penetrate. To convey\r\nan idea of its magnitude, it will suffice to say, that the hight of the\r\nbody of the church, from the ground to the upper part of its ceiling, is\r\nfour hundred and thirty-two feet, and that sixteen persons may place\r\nthemselves, without inconvenience, in the globular top over the dome,\r\nwhich is annually lighted, on the twenty-ninth of June, by four thousand\r\nlamps and two thousand fire-pots, presenting a most delightful\r\nspectacle. The vestibule of St. Peter’s is grand and beautiful. Over the\r\nsecond entrance is a fine mosaic from Giotto, executed in the year 1303;\r\nand at the corners, to the right and left, are the equestrian statues of\r\nConstantine and Charlemagne. Of the five doors leading to the church\r\nitself, one, called the holy door, is generally shut up by brick-work,\r\nand is only opened at the time of the jubilee. The middle gate is of\r\nbronze, with bass-reliefs.\r\n\r\nOf the one hundred and thirty statues with which this church is adorned,\r\nthat of St. Peter is the most conspicuous: it is said to have been\r\nrecast from a bronze statue of Jupiter Capitolinus. One hundred and\r\ntwelve lamps are constantly burning around the tomb of this saint; and\r\nthe high altar close to it, on which the pope alone reads mass, is\r\novershadowed by a ceiling, which exceeds in loftiness that of any palace\r\nof Rome. The splendid sacristy was built by Pius VI. But by far the\r\ngreatest ornaments of the interior are the excellent works in mosaic,\r\nall copied from the most celebrated pictures, which are thus guarded\r\nfrom oblivion.\r\n\r\nThe great and truly awful dome of St. Peter’s is only two feet less in\r\ndiameter than that of the Pantheon, being one hundred and thirty-seven\r\nfeet; but it exceeds the latter in hight by twenty feet, being one\r\nhundred and fifty-nine feet, besides the lantern, the basis pedestal of\r\nthe top, the globular top itself, and the cross above it, which,\r\ncollectively, measure one hundred and twenty feet. The roof of the\r\nchurch is ascended by easy steps; and here the visitor seems to have\r\nentered a small town, for he suddenly finds himself among a number of\r\nhouses, which either serve as repositories of implements and materials\r\nfor repairing the church, or are inhabited by the workmen. The dome, at\r\nthe foot of which he now arrives, appears to be the parish church of\r\nthis town; and the inferior domes seem as if intended only for ornaments\r\nto fill up the vacuities. Add to this, that he can not see the streets\r\nof Rome, on account of the surrounding high gallery and its colossal\r\nstatues, and the singularity of such a scene may be easily conceived. It\r\nis besides said, that a market is occasionally held here for the aerial\r\ninhabitants.\r\n\r\nBut although the adventurous stranger is now on the roof, he has still a\r\ngreat hight to ascend before he reaches the summit of the dome.\r\nPreviously to his engaging in this enterprise, he is conducted to the\r\ninside gallery of the dome. From this spot the people within the body of\r\nthe church appear like children. The higher he goes, the more\r\nuncomfortable he finds himself, on account of the oblique walls over the\r\nnarrow staircase; and he is often compelled to lean with his whole body\r\nquite to one side. Several marble plates are affixed in those walls,\r\ncontaining the names of the distinguished personages who have had the\r\ncourage to ascend to the dome, and even to climb up to the lantern, and\r\nthe top. The emperor Joseph II. is twice mentioned; and Paul I. as grand\r\nduke. In some parts, where the stairs are too steep, more commodious\r\nsteps of wood have been placed. By these the lantern can be reached with\r\ngreater facility; and the view which there waits the visitor, is\r\nmagnificent beyond description: _it is an immense panorama, bounded by\r\nthe sea_.\r\n\r\nSilliman, in his late “Visit to Europe,” adds points of interest with\r\nregard to St. Peter’s not given above, which therefore we quote. “The\r\ninterior,” he says, “is beyond description rich and magnificent. It is\r\nsaid to have cost fifty million dollars. The circumference of each of\r\nthe four great pillars which support the dome, is two hundred and\r\nthirty-four feet. The diameter of the dome is one hundred and\r\nninety-five feet; the hight of the dome to the lantern, is four hundred\r\nand five feet; to the top of the cross, is four hundred and thirty-four\r\nfeet. The floor is composed entirely of marble of various colors, and\r\ndisposed in ornamental forms; indeed, the whole interior of the church,\r\nthe columns and pilasters excepted, is faced with the most beautiful\r\nmarble, highly polished; while numerous medallions, exquisite monuments,\r\nand splendid mosaic copies of the best pictures, adorn the interior, and\r\nform an integral part of its walls. The roof, or ceiling, is stuccoed in\r\nsunken squares or panels, richly gilt. There is no part which is not\r\nsumptuously decorated. It seems as if ingenuity, art, taste, talent, and\r\nskill, all the resources of wealth, and of Nature herself, through all\r\nher vast storehouse of materials, had been laid under contribution, to\r\nmake St. Peter’s the most glorious of the structures reared by man. With\r\na pure faith, it would be a temple worthy of the God who created all the\r\nmaterials with which it is built, and who furnished man with all the\r\nfaculties, which have enabled him to rear and adorn this unrivaled\r\nstructure, a fit abode, like the glorious fane of Jerusalem, for the\r\nhabitation of the spiritual influence of Jehovah. St. Peter’s was one\r\nhundred and seventy-six years in building. Indeed, including all its\r\nvicissitudes, the period was three hundred and fifty years, under\r\nforty-three popes. It was finally dedicated by Urban VIII., November\r\neighteenth, 1626. The vases for holding holy water serve to give an idea\r\nof the immensity of the building. They are supported by cherubs, which,\r\non first entering the church, appear like children, but on approaching\r\nthem they are found to be six feet high. Another illustration is derived\r\nfrom the mosaic figures of the four evangelists, with their emblems over\r\nthe arches. The pen in the hand of St. Mark is six feet long. Upon the\r\nfrieze running round the basis of the dome is this inscription, each\r\nletter of which is six feet long, and yet the writing is only\r\nconveniently legible below: TV ES PETRVS ET SVPER HANC PETRAM AEDIFICABO\r\nECCLESIAM MEAM ET TIBI DABO CLAVES REGNI.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                           THE SOIL OF ROME.\r\n\r\nIn leaving the wonders of Rome, and the city itself, we will quote an\r\ninteresting extract from Townsend’s “Tour in Italy,” in 1850. “Many\r\nauthors,” he says, “have asserted, as their interpretation of some parts\r\nof the Apocalypse, that Rome will be destroyed by fire from heaven, or\r\nswallowed up by earthquakes, or overwhelmed with destruction by\r\nvolcanoes, as the visible punishment of the Almighty, for its popery and\r\nits crimes. I am unwilling, having read so many books on the\r\ninterpretation of the prophecy, to deduce any argument of this kind from\r\nthe prophecies which are unfulfilled; but I behold everywhere—in Rome,\r\nnear Rome, and through the whole region from Rome to Naples—the most\r\nastounding proofs, not merely of the possibility, but the probability\r\nthat the whole region of central Italy will one day be destroyed by such\r\na catastrophe. The soil of Rome is _tufa_, with a volcanic subterranean\r\naction still going on. At Naples the boiling sulphur is to be seen\r\nbubbling near the surface of the earth. When I drew a stick along upon\r\nthe ground, the sulphurous smoke followed the indentation; and it would\r\nnever surprise me to hear of the utter destruction of the southern\r\npeninsula of Italy. The entire country and district is volcanic. It is\r\nsaturated with beds of sulphur and the substrata of destruction. It\r\nseems as certainly prepared for the flames as the wood and coal on the\r\nhearth are prepared for the taper which shall kindle the fire to consume\r\nthem. I again read the remarks of Dr. Cumming: ‘Rome,’ he believes, ‘is\r\nto be overthrown by judgment; not to be converted by the agency of the\r\ngospel, nor to be exhausted by political assaults. It is literally to be\r\nconsumed by fire.’ Whether he is correct in regarding such an event as\r\nthe fulfillment of the prophecies, and the demonstration of the anger of\r\nthe Creator against the incorrigible assumption of an erring and\r\ninfluential church, I know not; but the divine hand alone seems to me to\r\nhold the element of fire in check by a miracle as great as that which\r\nprotected the cities of the plain, till the righteous Lot had made his\r\nescape to the mountains.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                         EDDYSTONE LIGHT-HOUSE.\r\n\r\nThe Eddystone rocks, on which this celebrated light-house is built, are\r\nsituated nearly south-south-west from the middle of Plymouth sound,\r\nbeing distant from the port of Plymouth nearly fourteen miles, and from\r\nthe promontory called Ramshead, about ten miles. They are almost in the\r\nline, but somewhat within it, which joins the Start and the Lizard\r\npoints; and as they lie nearly in the direction of vessels coasting up\r\nand down the channel, they were necessarily, before the establishment of\r\na light-house, very dangerous, and often fatal to ships under such\r\ncircumstances. Their situation, likewise, relatively to the bay of\r\nBiscay and the Atlantic ocean, is such that they lie open to the swells\r\nof both from all the south-western points of the compass; which swells\r\nare generally allowed by mariners to be very great and heavy in those\r\nseas, and particularly in the bay of Biscay. It is to be observed, that\r\nthe soundings of the sea, from the south-west toward the Eddystone, are\r\nfrom eighty fathoms to forty, and that in every part, until the rocks\r\nare approached, the sea has a depth of at least thirty fathoms; insomuch\r\nthat all the heavy seas from the south-west reach them uncontrolled, and\r\nbreak on them with the utmost fury.\r\n\r\nThe force and hight of these seas are increased by the fact that the\r\nrocks stretch across the channel, in a direction north and south, to the\r\nlength of above one hundred fathoms, and by their lying in a sloping\r\nmanner toward the south-west quarter. This _striving_ of the rocks, as\r\nit is technically called, does not cease at low-water, but still goes on\r\nprogressively; so that, at fifty fathoms westward, there are twelve\r\nfathoms of water; neither does it terminate at the distance of a mile.\r\nFrom this configuration it happens, that the seas are swollen to such a\r\ndegree, in storms and heavy gales of wind, as to break on the rocks with\r\nthe utmost violence. It is not surprising, therefore, that the dangers\r\nto which navigators were exposed by the Eddystone rocks should have made\r\na great commercial nation desirous to have a light-house erected on\r\nthem. The wonder is that any one should have had sufficient resolution\r\nto undertake its construction. Such a man was, however, found in the\r\nperson of Mr. Henry Winstanley, of Littleburgh, in Essex, who, being\r\nfurnished with the necessary powers to carry the design into execution,\r\nentered on his undertaking in 1696, and completed it in four years. So\r\ncertain was he of the stability of his structure, that he declared it to\r\nbe his wish to be in it “during the greatest storm which ever blew under\r\nthe face of the heavens.” In this wish he was but too amply gratified;\r\nfor while he was there with his workmen and light-keepers, that dreadful\r\nstorm began, which raged most violently on the night of the twenty-sixth\r\nof November, 1703; and of all the accounts of the kind with which\r\nhistory has furnished us, no one has exceeded this in Great Britain, nor\r\nhas been more injurious or extensive in its devastations. On the\r\nfollowing morning, when the storm was so much abated, that an inquiry\r\ncould be made, whether the light-house had suffered from it, nothing was\r\nto be seen standing, with the exception of some of the large irons by\r\nwhich the work was fixed on the rock; nor were any of the people, nor\r\nany of the materials of the building ever found afterward.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE EDDYSTONE LIGHT-HOUSE.]\r\n\r\nIn 1709, another light-house was built of wood, on a very different\r\nconstruction, by Mr. John Rudyerd, then a silk-mercer on Ludgate hill.\r\nThis very ingenious structure, after having braved the elements for\r\nforty-six years, was burned to the ground in 1755. On the destruction of\r\nthis light-house, that excellent mechanic and engineer, Mr. Smeaton, was\r\nselected as the fittest person to build another. He found some\r\ndifficulty in persuading the proprietors, that a stone building,\r\nproperly constructed, would be in every respect preferable to one of\r\nwood; but having at length convinced them, he turned his thoughts to the\r\nshape which would be most suitable to a building so critically situated.\r\nReflecting on the structure of the former buildings, it seemed to him a\r\nmaterial improvement to procure, if possible, an enlargement of the\r\nbase, without increasing the size of the waist, or that part of the\r\nbuilding placed between the top of the rock and the top of the solid\r\nwork. Hence he thought a greater degree of strength and stiffness would\r\nbe gained, accompanied with less resistance to the acting power. On this\r\noccasion, the natural figure of the waist, or bole of a large spreading\r\noak, occurred to our sagacious engineer.\r\n\r\nWith these very enlightened views, as to the proper form of the\r\nsuperstructure, Mr. Smeaton began the work on the second of April, 1757,\r\nand completed it on the fourth of August, 1759. Its appearance, as\r\ncompleted, may be seen in the cut on the preceding page. The rock, which\r\nslopes toward the south-west, is cut into horizontal steps, into which\r\nare dovetailed, and united by a strong cement, Portland stone and\r\ngranite. The whole to the hight of thirty-five feet from the foundation,\r\nis a solid body of stones, engrafted into each other, and united by\r\nevery means of additional strength that could be devised. The building\r\nhas four rooms, one over the other, and at the top a gallery and\r\nlantern. The stone floors are flat above, but concave beneath, and are\r\nkept from pressing against the sides of the building by a chain let into\r\nthe walls. It is nearly eighty feet in hight, and since its completion\r\nhas been assaulted by the fury of the elements, without suffering the\r\nsmallest injury. To trace the progress of so vast an undertaking, and to\r\nshow with what skill and judgment this unparalleled engineer overcame\r\nthe greatest difficulties, would far exceed the limits of this work.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         BELL ROCK LIGHT-HOUSE.\r\n\r\nThe Bell rock, or Inch cape, is situated on the north-east coast of\r\nGreat Britain, twelve miles south-west from the town of Arbroath, in\r\nFifeshire, and thirty miles north-east from St. Abb’s head, in the\r\ncounty of Berwick. It lies in the direct trace of the firth of Tay, and\r\nof a great proportion of the shipping of the firth of Forth, embracing a\r\nvery extensive local trade. This estuary is besides the principal inlet\r\non the northern coast of Britain, in which the shipping of the German\r\nocean and North sea take refuge when overtaken by easterly storms. At\r\nneap-tides, or at the quadratures of the moon, the Bell rock is scarcely\r\nuncovered at low-water; but in spring-tides, when the ebbs are greatest,\r\nthat part of the rock which is exposed to view at low-water, measures\r\nabout four hundred and twenty-seven feet in length, by two hundred and\r\nthirty in breadth; and in this low state of the tides, its average\r\nperpendicular hight above the surface of the sea is about four feet.\r\nBeyond the space included in these measurements, at very low tides, a\r\nreef extends about a thousand feet in a south-west direction, from the\r\nhigher part of the rock just described; and on this reef the light-house\r\nis erected.\r\n\r\nIn the erection of a light-house on the Bell rock, independently of its\r\ndistance from the main land, a serious difficulty presented itself,\r\narising from the greater depth of water at which it was necessary to\r\ncarry on the operations, than in the case of the Eddystone light-house,\r\ndescribed above, or of any other building of the same kind, ancient or\r\nmodern, which had been hitherto undertaken. Its description is as\r\nfollows.\r\n\r\nThe Bell rock light-house, which has not improperly been termed the\r\nScottish Pharos, is a circular building, the foundation stone of which\r\nis nearly on a level with the surface of the sea at low-water of\r\nordinary spring-tides; and, consequently, at high-water of these tides\r\nthe building is immersed to the hight of about fifteen feet. The first\r\ntwo, or lowest courses of the masonry, are imbedded, or sunk into the\r\nrock, and the stones of all the courses are curiously dovetailed and\r\njoined with each other, forming one connected mass from the center to\r\nthe circumference. The successive courses of the work are also attached\r\nto each other by joggles of stone; and, to prevent the stones from being\r\nlifted up by the force of the sea, while the work was in progress, each\r\nstone of the solid part of the building had two holes bored through it,\r\nentering six inches into the course immediately below, into which oaken\r\ntree-nails, two inches in diameter, were driven, after Mr. Smeaton’s\r\nplan at the Eddystone light-house. The cement used at the Bell rock,\r\nlike that at the latter, was a mixture of pozzuolana, earth, lime, and\r\nsand, in equal parts, by measure.\r\n\r\nThe stones employed in this surprising structure weigh from two tuns to\r\nhalf a tun each. The ground course measures forty-two feet in diameter,\r\nand the building diminishes as it rises to the top, where the parapet\r\nwall of the light-room has a diameter of thirteen feet only. It is solid\r\nfrom the ground course to the hight of thirty feet, where the entry door\r\nis placed, the ascent to which is by a kind of rope-ladder, with wooden\r\nsteps, hung out at ebb-tide, and taken into the building again when the\r\nwater covers the rock; but strangers to this sort of climbing are taken\r\nup in a kind of chair, by a small movable crane projected from the door,\r\nfrom which a narrow passage leads to a stone staircase thirteen feet in\r\nhight. Here the walls are seven feet thick, but they gradually diminish\r\nfrom the top of the staircase to the parapet wall of the light-room,\r\nwhere they measure one foot only in thickness. The upper part of the\r\nbuilding is divided into six apartments for the use of the light-house\r\nkeepers, and for containing the light-house stores. The lower, or first\r\nof these floors, contains the water-tanks, fuel, and other bulky\r\narticles; the second, the oil-cisterns, glass, and other light-room\r\nstores; the third is occupied as a kitchen; the fourth is the bed-room;\r\nthe fifth, the _library_, or stranger’s room; and the upper apartment\r\nforms the light-room. The floors of the several apartments are of stone,\r\nand the communication from the one to the other is effected by wooden\r\nladders, except in the case of the light-room, where every article being\r\nfire-proof, the steps are made of iron. In each of the three lower\r\napartments are two windows; but the upper rooms have four windows each.\r\nThe casements of the windows are double, and are glazed with\r\nplate-glass, having besides an outer storm-shutter, or dead-light, of\r\ntimber, to defend the glass from the waves and spray of the sea. The\r\nparapet wall of the light-room is six feet in hight, and has a door\r\nleading out to the balcony, or walk, formed by the cornice round the\r\nupper part of the building, which is surrounded by a cast-iron rail,\r\ncuriously wrought like net-work. This rail reposes on batts of brass,\r\nand has a massive coping, or top-rail, of the same metal.\r\n\r\nThe light-room was, with the whole of its apparatus, framed and prepared\r\nat Edinburgh. It is of an octagonal figure, measuring twelve feet\r\nacross, and fifteen feet in hight, formed with cast-iron sashes, or\r\nwindow frames, glazed with large plates of polished glass, measuring\r\nabout two feet and six inches, by two feet and a quarter, and the fourth\r\nof an inch in thickness. It is covered with a dome roof of copper,\r\nterminating in a large gilt ball, with a vent-hole in the top. The light\r\nis very powerful, and is readily seen at the distance of seven leagues,\r\nwhen the atmosphere is clear. It is from oil, with argand burners,\r\nplaced in the focus of silver-plated reflectors, measuring two feet over\r\nthe lips, the silver surface being hollowed, or wrought to the parabolic\r\ncurve. That this splendid light may be the more easily distinguished\r\nfrom all the other lights on the coast, the reflectors are ranged on a\r\nframe with four faces, or sides, which, by a train of machinery, is made\r\nto revolve on a perpendicular axis once in six minutes. Between the\r\nobserver and the reflectors, on two opposite sides of the revolving\r\nframe, shades of red glass are interposed in such a manner, that, during\r\neach entire revolution of the reflectors, two appearances, distinctly\r\ndiffering from each other, are produced: one is the common _bright\r\nlight_ familiar to all; but on the other, or shaded sides, the rays are\r\ntinged of a _red color_. These red and bright lights, in the course of\r\neach revolution, alternate with intervals of darkness, and thus in a\r\nvery beautiful and simple manner, characterize this light.\r\n\r\nAs a further warning to the mariner in foggy weather, two large bells,\r\neach weighing about twelve hundred pounds, are tolled day and night by\r\nthe same machinery which moves the lights. As these bells, in moderate\r\nweather, may be heard considerably beyond the limits of the rock,\r\nvessels, by this expedient, get warning to put about, and are thereby\r\nprevented from running on the rock in thick and hazy weather, a disaster\r\nto which ships might otherwise be liable, notwithstanding the erection\r\nof the light-house. The establishment consists of a principal\r\nlight-keeper, with three assistants, two of whom are constantly at the\r\nlight-house, while the third is stationed at a tower erected at\r\nArbroath, where he corresponds by signals with the light-keepers at the\r\nrock. This stupendous undertaking is highly creditable to Mr. Stevenson,\r\nthe engineer, and does honor to the age in which it has been produced.\r\nThe lights were exhibited, for the first time, on the first of February,\r\n1811.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              STONEHENGE.\r\n\r\nThis celebrated monument of antiquity, a view of which is given in the\r\ncut on the next page, stands in the middle of a flat area near the\r\nsummit of a hill, six miles distant from Salisbury. It is inclosed by a\r\ndouble circular bank and ditch, nearly thirty feet broad, after crossing\r\nwhich an ascent of thirty yards leads to the work. The whole fabric, of\r\nwhich the cut exhibits only a section, was originally composed of two\r\ncircles and two ovals. The outer circle is about one hundred and eight\r\nfeet in diameter, consisting, when entire, of sixty stones, thirty\r\nuprights, and thirty imposts, of which there now remain twenty-four\r\nuprights only, seventeen standing, and seven down, three feet and a half\r\nasunder, and eight imposts. Eleven uprights have their five imposts on\r\nthem at the grand entrance: these stones are from thirteen to twenty\r\nfeet high. The smaller circle is somewhat more than eight feet from the\r\ninside of the outer one, and consisted of forty smaller stones, the\r\nhighest measuring about six feet, nineteen only of which now remain, and\r\nonly eleven standing. The walk between these two circles is three\r\nhundred feet in circumference. The _adytum_, or cell, is an oval formed\r\nof ten stones, from sixteen to twenty-two feet high, in pairs, and with\r\nimposts above thirty feet high, rising in hight as they go round, and\r\neach pair separate, and not connected as the outer pair: the highest\r\neight feet. Within these, are nineteen other smaller single stones, of\r\nwhich six only are standing. At the upper end of the adytum is the\r\naltar, a large slab of blue coarse marble, twenty inches thick, sixteen\r\nfeet long, and four broad: it is pressed down by the weight of the vast\r\nstones which have fallen upon it. The whole number of stones, uprights\r\nand imposts, comprehending the altar, is one hundred and forty. The\r\nstones, which have been by some considered artificial, were most\r\nprobably brought from those called the _gray weathers_ on Marlborough\r\ndowns, distant fifteen or sixteen miles; and if tried with a tool,\r\nappear of the same hardness, grain and color, being generally reddish.\r\nThe heads of oxen, deer, and other beasts, have been found in digging in\r\nand about Stonehenge; and in the circumjacent barrows, human bones. From\r\nthe plain to this structure there are three entrances, the most\r\nconsiderable of which is from the north-east; and at each of them were\r\nraised, on the outside of the trench, two huge stones, with two smaller\r\nparallel ones within.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STONEHENGE.]\r\n\r\nGeoffrey of Monmouth, in his history of the Britons, written in the\r\nreign of King Stephen, represents this monument as having been erected\r\nat the command of Aurelius Ambrosius, the last British king, in memory\r\nof four hundred and sixty Britons who were murdered by Hengist the\r\nSaxon. Polydore Virgil says that it was erected by the Britons as the\r\nsepulchral monument of Aurelius Ambrosius, and other writers consider it\r\nto have been that of the famous British queen Boadicea. Inigo Jones is\r\nof opinion that it was a Roman temple; and this conclusion he draws from\r\na stone sixteen feet in length, and four in breadth, placed in an exact\r\nposition to the eastward, altar-fashion. By Charlton it is ascribed to\r\nthe Danes, who were two years masters of Wiltshire; a tin tablet, on\r\nwhich were some unknown characters, having been dug up in the vicinity,\r\nin the reign of Henry VIII. This tablet, which is lost, might have given\r\nsome information respecting its founders. Its common name, Stonehenge,\r\nis Saxon, and signifies a “stone gallows,” to which the stones, having\r\ntransverse imposts, bear some resemblance. It is also called in Welch,\r\n_choir gour_, or the giants’ dance. Mr. Grose, the antiquary, is of\r\nopinion that Doctor Stukely has completely proved this structure to have\r\nbeen a British temple, in which the Druids officiated. He supposes it to\r\nhave been the metropolitan temple of Great Britain, and translates the\r\nwords _choir gour_, “the great choir or temple.” It was customary with\r\nthe Druids to place one large stone on another for a religious memorial;\r\nand these they often placed so equably, that even a breath of wind would\r\nsometimes make them vibrate. Of such stones one remains at this day in\r\nthe pile of Stonehenge. The ancients distinguished stones erected with a\r\nreligious view, by the name of _ambrosiæ petræ_, _amber stones_, the\r\nword _amber_ implying whatever is solar and divine. According to Bryant,\r\nStonehenge is composed of these amber stones; and hence the next town is\r\ndenominated Ambresbury.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            ROCKING STONES.\r\n\r\nThe _rocking stone_, or _logan_, is a stone of a prodigious size, so\r\nnicely poised, that it rocks or shakes with the smallest force. Several\r\nof the consecrated stones mentioned above, were rocking stones; and\r\nthere was a wonderful monument of this kind near Penzance in Cornwall,\r\nwhich still retains the name of _main-amber_, or the sacred stones. With\r\nthese stones the ancients were not unacquainted. Pliny relates that at\r\nHarpasa, a town of Asia, there was a rock of such a wonderful nature,\r\nthat, if touched with the finger, it would shake, but could not be moved\r\nfrom its place with the whole force of the body. Ptolemy Hephistion\r\nmentions a stone of this description near the ocean, which was agitated\r\nwhen struck by the stalk of the plant asphodel, or day-lily, but could\r\nnot be removed by a great exertion of force. Another is cited by\r\nApollonius Rhodius, supposed to have been raised in the time of the\r\nArgonauts, in the island Tenos, as the monument of the two-winged sons\r\nof Boreas, slain by Hercules; and there are others in China, and in\r\nother countries.\r\n\r\nMany rocking stones are to be found in different parts of Great Britain;\r\nsome natural, and others artificial, or placed in their position by\r\nhuman art. That the latter are monuments erected by the Druids, many\r\nsuppose can not be doubted; but tradition has not handed down the\r\nprecise purpose for which they were intended. In the parish of St.\r\nLeven, Cornwall, there is a promontory called Castle Treryn. On the\r\nwestern side of the middle group, near the top, lies a very large stone,\r\nso evenly poised, that a hand may move it from one side to the other;\r\nyet so fixed on its base, that no lever, or other mechanical force, can\r\nremove it from its present situation. It is called the _logan-stone_,\r\nand is at such a hight from the ground as to render it incredible that\r\nit was raised to its present position by art. There are, however, other\r\nrocking stones, so shaped and situated, that there can not be any doubt\r\nof their having been erected by human strength. Of this kind the great\r\n_quoit_, or _karn-le hau_, in the parish of Tywidnek, in Wales, is\r\nconsidered. It is thirty-nine feet in circumference, and four feet thick\r\nat a medium, and stands on a single pedestal. In the island of St.\r\nAgnes, Scilly, is a remarkable stone of the same kind. The under rock is\r\nten and a half feet high, forty-seven feet round the middle, and touches\r\nthe ground with not more than half its base. The upper rock rests on one\r\npoint only, and is so nicely balanced, that two or three men with a pole\r\ncan move it. It is eight and a half feet high, and forty-seven in\r\ncircumference. On the top is a basin hollowed out, three feet and eleven\r\ninches in diameter at a medium, but wider at the brim, and three feet in\r\ndepth. From the globular shape of the upper stone, it is highly probable\r\nthat it was rounded by human art, and perhaps even placed on its\r\npedestal by human strength. In Sithney parish, near Helston, in\r\nCornwall, stood the famous logan, or rocking stone, commonly called _Men\r\nAmber_, that is, _Men an Bar_, or the top stone. It was eleven feet by\r\nsix, and four high, and so nicely poised on another stone, that a little\r\nchild could move it. It was much visited by travelers; but Shrubsall,\r\nthe governor of Pendennis castle, under Cromwell, caused it to be\r\nundermined, by dint of much labor, to the great grief of the country.\r\nThere are some marks of the tool on it; and it seems probable, by its\r\ntriangular shape, that it was dedicated to Mercury.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      THE ROUND TOWERS OF IRELAND.\r\n\r\nEvery one, almost, has heard of the round towers of Ireland; and yet,\r\nwho has been able to explain their origin, or solve the mystery that\r\nhangs over the history of their builders, and the purposes for which\r\nthey were erected?\r\n\r\nOf these towers, one hundred and seven are known to have existed; but\r\nprobably there were many more. Some are still perfect, others are in\r\nruins. They bear a general resemblance to each other, seeming,\r\ntherefore, to have had the same object in view; yet there were many\r\nminute points of difference. Some were but forty feet high; others\r\nsixty, eighty, and one a hundred and twenty feet. The common hight is\r\nabout eighty or ninety feet. Most of them were of a cylindrical form,\r\nand were covered with a conical roof. They were generally divided into\r\nthree stories, with a window to each. The door of entrance was from six\r\nto twenty-four feet from the ground; but how this was reached is not\r\nknown. In some cases, they were built of hewn stone, nicely laid in\r\nmortar; in others, the stones are merely hammered; in others still, they\r\nare small and of all shapes, but always firmly cemented by mortar,\r\nnearly as hard as the rock itself.\r\n\r\nThat these towers are very ancient, is clear from the fact that when\r\nIreland was first invaded by the English, in the twelfth century, they\r\nwere then deemed antiquities, and no one was able to tell their origin\r\nor design. Some have been used as towers and belfries of churches; but\r\nthese churches were built in later times, and this use of the towers\r\nwas, evidently, but an adaptation of old structures to new purposes. The\r\nfact that near them, in most cases, ancient churches, or their remains,\r\nare found, has led to the belief that they were ecclesiastical\r\nstructures, erected by the early Christians of Ireland. This idea is\r\nexploded by the circumstance that no such buildings have ever been known\r\nto be erected in any other part of the world, in connection with the\r\nChristian religion; nor is it possible to conjecture for what object, as\r\npart of Christian worship, they could have been designed.\r\n\r\nThe more prevalent and probable opinion, on the subject, seems to be\r\nthis: that they were erected by the Phœnicians or Carthaginians, who are\r\nknown to have had settlements in Ireland before the Christian era; or\r\nthat they were built by the remote Irish, who bore the name of _Scoti_,\r\nand who were of Asiatic origin. The object of these buildings, on this\r\nsupposition, was the preservation of the _sacred fire_, kindled in honor\r\nof Bel, or Baal, a heathen divinity of the east, and who is known to\r\nhave been worshiped in Ireland. Indeed, to the present day, some of the\r\nreligious rites of the Irish are evidently but the perpetuation of the\r\nceremonies of their ancestors, turned from their pagan origin and\r\nblended with Catholic observances. This view of the origin and object of\r\nthe round towers is strongly confirmed by the fact that in their\r\nvicinity are still to be found the well known relics of ancient\r\npaganism, such as the _sun-stone_, the _cromlech_, the _fire-house_, the\r\n_spring of sacred water_, necessary in mystic rites, &c. To this it may\r\nbe added, that in Persia and India, where fire-worship originated, and\r\nhas had its most extensive and enduring seat, there are towers of\r\nvarious forms and sizes, ascribed, in their origin, to this species of\r\nidolatry. It is probable, therefore, that the early settlers of Ireland\r\nbrought from Asia, their original country, ideas of religion, which\r\nbecame modified in the course of ages, but which, still remaining\r\nessentially the same, displayed themselves in the structures which we\r\nhave described. The fact that Christian churches, or their remains, are\r\nfound near these towers in Ireland, does not controvert the opinion we\r\nexpress, as, in the first place, they are evidently more modern than the\r\ntowers themselves, and are of a different style of architecture; and,\r\nmoreover, we know that the early Christians often chose, as the seat of\r\ntheir churches, the very sites on which paganism had reared its\r\nstructures, and not unfrequently adapted the structures themselves to\r\nthe purposes of Christian worship; a fact which rather confirms than\r\nopposes the common theory as to these towers.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         ST. PAUL’S CATHEDRAL.\r\n\r\nThe chief ecclesiastical ornament of London is the cathedral church of\r\nSt. Paul, which stands in the center of the metropolis, on an eminence\r\nrising from the valley of the Fleet. The body of the church is in the\r\nform of a cross. Over the space where the lines of that figure intersect\r\neach other, rises a stately dome, from the top of which springs a\r\nlantern adorned with Corinthian columns, and surrounded at its base by a\r\nbalcony; on the lantern rests a gilded ball, and on that a cross (gilt\r\nalso) crowning the ornaments of the edifice. The length of the church,\r\nincluding the portico, is five hundred and ten feet; the breadth, two\r\nhundred and eighty-two; the hight to the top of the cross, four hundred\r\nand four; the exterior diameter of the dome, one hundred and forty-five;\r\nand the entire circumference of the building, twenty-two hundred and\r\nninety-two feet. A dwarf stone wall, supporting a balustrade of cast\r\niron, surrounds the church, and separates a large area, which is\r\nproperly the church-yard, from a spacious carriage and foot-way on the\r\nsouth side, and a foot pavement on the north.\r\n\r\nThe dimensions of this cathedral are great; but the grandeur of the\r\ndesign, and the beauty and elegance of its proportions, more justly rank\r\nit among the noblest edifices of the modern world. It is adorned with\r\nthree porticos; one at the principal entrance, facing the west, and\r\nrunning parallel with the opening of Ludgate street and the other two\r\nfacing the north and south, at the extremities of the cross aisle, and\r\ncorresponding in their architecture. The western portico combines as\r\nmuch grace and magnificence as any specimen of the kind in the world. It\r\nconsists of twelve lofty Corinthian columns below, and eight composite\r\nabove, supporting a grand pediment; the whole resting on an elevated\r\nbase, the ascent to which is by a flight of twenty-two square steps of\r\nblack marble, running the entire length of the portico. The portico at\r\nthe northern entrance consists of a dome, supported by six Corinthian\r\ncolumns, with an ascent of twelve circular steps, of black marble. The\r\nsouthern portico is similar, except that the ascent consists of\r\ntwenty-five steps, the ground on that side being lower.\r\n\r\nThe great dome is ornamented with thirty-two columns below, and a range\r\nof pilasters above. At the eastern extremity of the church is a circular\r\nprojection, forming a recess within for the communion table. The walls\r\nare wrought in rustic, and strengthened and ornamented by two rows of\r\ncoupled pilasters, one above the other, the lower being Corinthian, and\r\nthe other composite. The northern and southern sides have an air of\r\nuncommon elegance. The corners of the western front are crowned with\r\nturrets of an airy and light form. To relieve the heavy style of the\r\ninterior, statues and monuments have been erected to the memory of great\r\nmen. The statues are plain full-length figures, standing on marble\r\npedestals, with appropriate inscriptions, in honor of such men as Dr.\r\nSamuel Johnson, Howard the philanthropist, Sir William Jones, &c., &c.\r\nSeveral of the monuments would disgrace the most barbarous age, and\r\nought to be removed. The tomb of the great Nelson is beneath the\r\npavement immediately under the dome.\r\n\r\nThe two turrets on the right and left of the west front are each two\r\nhundred and eight feet in hight. In the one on the southern side is the\r\ngreat clock, the bell of which, weighing eleven thousand, four hundred\r\nand seventy-four pounds, and being ten feet in diameter, may be heard in\r\nthe most distant part of London, when the wind blows toward that\r\nquarter. The entire pavement, up to the altar, is of marble, chiefly\r\nconsisting of square slabs, alternately black and white, and is very\r\njustly admired. The floor round the communion table is of the same kind\r\nof marble, mingled with porphyry. The communion table has no other\r\nbeauty; for, though it is ornamented with four fluted pilasters, which\r\nare very noble in their form, they are merely painted and veined with\r\ngold, in imitation of _lapis lazuli_. Eight Corinthian columns of blue\r\nand white marble, of exquisite beauty, support the organ gallery. The\r\nstalls in the choir are beautifully carved, and the other ornaments are\r\nof equal workmanship.\r\n\r\nThis cathedral was built at the national expense, and cost over\r\nthirty-five hundred thousand dollars. The iron balustrade on the wall\r\nsurrounding the space that is properly the church-yard, including its\r\nseven iron gates, weighs two hundred tuns, and cost over fifty thousand\r\ndollars. This immense edifice was reared in thirty-five years, the first\r\nstone being laid on the twenty-first of June, 1675, and the building\r\ncompleted in 1710, exclusive of some of the decorations, which were not\r\nfinished till 1723. The highest stone of the lantern was laid on by Mr.\r\nChristopher Wren, son of the architect, in 1710. It was built by one\r\narchitect, Sir Christopher Wren; by one mason, Mr. Strong; and while one\r\nprelate, Dr. Henry Compton, filled the see of London.\r\n\r\nThe dimensions of St. Paul’s, from east to west, within the walls, are\r\nfive hundred and ten feet; from north to south, within the doors of the\r\nporticos, two hundred and eighty-two; the breadth of the west entrance,\r\none hundred; its circuit, twenty-two hundred and ninety-two; its hight\r\nwithin, from the center of the floor to the cross, three hundred and\r\nforty feet. The circumference of the dome is four hundred and thirty\r\nfeet; the diameter of the ball, six; from the ball to the top of the\r\ncross, thirty; and the diameter of the columns of the porticos, four\r\nfeet. The hight to the top of the west pediment, under the figure of St.\r\nPaul, is one hundred and twenty feet; and that of the tower of the west\r\nfront, two hundred and eighty-seven. From the bottom of the\r\nwhispering-gallery are two hundred and eighty steps; including those to\r\nthe golden gallery, five hundred and thirty-four, and to the ball, in\r\nall, six hundred and sixteen steps. The weight of the ball is fifty-six\r\nhundred pounds. The weight of the cross is thirty-three hundred and\r\nsixty. The extent of the ground whereon this cathedral stands, is two\r\nacres and sixteen perches. The length of the hour figures, two feet and\r\ntwo and a half inches; the circumference of the dial is fifty-seven\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\nThe _whispering-gallery_ is a very great curiosity. It is one hundred\r\nand forty yards in circumference. A stone seat runs round the gallery\r\nalong the foot of the wall. On the side directly opposite the door by\r\nwhich the visitor enters, several yards of the seat are covered with\r\nmatting, on which the visitor being seated, the man who shows the\r\ngallery, whispers, with the mouth close to the wall, near the door, at\r\nthe distance of one hundred and forty feet from the visitor, who hears\r\nhis words in a loud voice, seemingly at his ear. The mere shutting of\r\nthe door produces a sound to those on the opposite seat like violent\r\nclaps of thunder. The effect is not so perfect if the visitor sits down\r\nhalf-way between the door and the matted seat, and still less so if he\r\nstands near the man who speaks, but on the other side of the door.\r\n\r\nThe marble pavement of the church is extremely beautiful, seen from this\r\ngallery. The paintings on the inner side of the dome, by Sir James\r\nThornhill, are viewed with most advantage here. The ascent to the ball\r\nis attended with some difficulty, and is encountered by few, yet both\r\nthe ball and passage to it well deserve the labor. The diameter of the\r\ninterior of the ball is nearly six feet, and twelve persons may sit\r\nwithin it.\r\n\r\nThe prospect from every part of the ascent to the top of St. Paul’s,\r\nwherever an opening presents itself, is extremely curious. The effect is\r\nmost complete from the gallery surrounding the foot of the lantern. The\r\nmetropolis, from that spot, has a mimic appearance, like the objects in\r\na _fantoccino_. The streets, the pavements, the carriages, and\r\nfoot-passengers, have the appearance of fairy ground and fairy objects.\r\nThe spectator, contemplating the bustle of the diminutive throng below,\r\nis moved a little out of the sphere of his usual sympathy with them;\r\nand, as if they were emmets, asks himself involuntarily, “About what are\r\nthose little, inconsequential animals engaged?”\r\n\r\nThe form of the metropolis, and the adjacent country, is most perfectly\r\nseen from the gallery at the foot of the lantern, on a bright summer\r\nday. The ascent to this gallery is by five hundred and thirty-four\r\nsteps, of which two hundred and sixty, nearest the bottom, are extremely\r\neasy; those above difficult, and in some parts dark and unpleasant. In\r\nthe ascent to this gallery may be seen the brick cone that supports the\r\nlantern, with its ball and cross; the outer dome being turned on the\r\noutside of the cone, and the inner dome turned on the inside. The entire\r\ncontrivance to produce the effect within the church and on the outside,\r\nintended by the architect, is extremely fine, even marvelous. From the\r\npavement of the church, the interior appears one uninterrupted dome to\r\nthe upper extremity; but it consists, in fact, of two parts, the lower\r\nand principal dome having a large circular aperture at its top, through\r\nwhich is seen a small dome, which appears to be part of the great and\r\nlower dome, although entirely separated from it, being turned also\r\nwithin the cone, though considerably above it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIRST CHURCH IN ENGLAND.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                      THE FIRST CHURCH IN ENGLAND.\r\n\r\nBefore passing to speak of Westminster Abbey, which next to St. Paul’s\r\nis the great ecclesiastical edifice of London, it may be interesting to\r\ngo back to the earliest church-building in Britain, and notice the kind\r\nof edifices in which our remote ancestors assembled for divine worship.\r\nOne of these buildings is represented in the cut below; as to which only\r\na few words of explanation will be needed. About the close of the sixth\r\ncentury, it is said, the pope sent Austin, with some forty missionaries,\r\nto convert Britain to popery. Many of the ancient Britons, however, shut\r\nthemselves up in the fastnesses of Wales, and refused to be either\r\npersuaded or driven to embrace the new faith which he proclaimed. Still\r\nAustin went on with his work, and the more efficiently to fulfill it,\r\nerected rude edifices, in which to gather the people, to teach them, and\r\ntrain them to the forms of worship. The first building erected under his\r\nauspices, was at Glastonbury, in the county of Somerset. The view given\r\nof it above is from Somme’s “Britannia Antiqua Illustrata;” and the\r\nfollowing particulars about the building itself are taken mainly from\r\nthe “Chronicles of William of Malmesbury.” Its length was sixty feet,\r\nand its breadth twenty-six. Its walls were made of twigs winded and\r\ntwisted together, “after the ancient custom that kings’ palaces were\r\nused to be built.” “Nay, castles themselves in those daies were formed\r\nof the same materials, and weaved together.” Its roof was of straw, “or,\r\nafter the nature of the soil in that place, of hay or rushes.” The top\r\nof the door reached to the roof; it had three windows on the south side,\r\nand one on the east, over the altar, or communion-table. Such was the\r\nrude and humble building in which Austin first preached to those that he\r\nwas able to gather to hear the gospel from his lips.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           WESTMINSTER ABBEY.\r\n\r\nThis interesting edifice derives its name of _Westminster Abbey_ from\r\nits situation in the western part of the metropolis, and its original\r\ndestination as the church of a monastery. The present church was built\r\nby Henry III. and his successors, with the exception of the two towers\r\nat the western entrance, which are the work of Sir Christopher Wren. The\r\nlength of the church is three hundred and sixty feet; the breadth of the\r\nnave seventy-two feet; and the cross aisle one hundred and ninety-five\r\nfeet. The roof of the nave and of the cross aisle is supported by two\r\nrows of arches, one above the other, each of the pillars of which is a\r\nunion of one ponderous round pillar, and four of similar form, but\r\nextremely slender. These aisles being extremely lofty, and one of the\r\nsmall pillars continued, throughout, from the base to the roof, produce\r\nan effect uncommonly grand and impressive. The choir is one of the most\r\nbeautiful in Europe. It is divided from the western part of the great\r\naisle by a pair of noble iron gates, and is terminated at the east by an\r\nelegant altar of white marble. The altar is inclosed with a very fine\r\nbalustrade, and in the center of its floor is a large square of curious\r\nmosaic work, of porphyry, and other stones of various colors. In this\r\nchoir, near the altar, is performed the ceremony of crowning the kings\r\nand queens of England.\r\n\r\nAt the southern extremity of the cross aisle are erected monuments to\r\nthe memory of several of the most eminent poets. This interesting spot\r\nis called the poet’s corner; and never could place be named with more\r\npropriety; for here are to be found the names of Chaucer, Spenser,\r\nShakspeare, Ben Jonson, Milton, Dryden, Butler, Thomson, Gay, Goldsmith,\r\nAddison, Johnson, &c. Here also, as if this spot was dedicated to all\r\ngenius of the highest rank, are the tombs of Handel, Chambers, and\r\nGarrick.\r\n\r\nThe curiosities of Westminster Abbey consist chiefly of its highly\r\ninteresting chapels, at the eastern end of the church, with their tombs.\r\nImmediately behind the altar stands a chapel dedicated to Edward the\r\nConfessor, upon an elevated floor, to which there is a flight of steps\r\non the northern side. The shrine of the Confessor, which stands in the\r\ncenter, was erected by Henry III., and was curiously ornamented with\r\nmosaic work of colored stones, which have been picked away in every part\r\nwithin reach. Within the shrine is a chest, containing the ashes of the\r\nConfessor. The frieze representing his history from his birth to his\r\ndeath, put up in the time of Henry III., is highly curious, and deserves\r\nthe study and attention of every lover of antiquity. The tomb of Henry\r\nIII. is in this chapel: it has been extremely splendid, but is now\r\nmutilated. The table on which lies the king’s effigy in brass, is\r\nsupported by four twisted pillars, enameled with gilt. This tomb, which\r\nis a fine specimen of its kind, is almost entire on the side next the\r\narea. It likewise contains the tombs of Edward I. and his queen,\r\nEleanor; of Edward III. and Queen Philippa; of Richard II. and his\r\nqueen; of Margaret, daughter of King Edward IV.; of King Henry V.; and\r\nof Elizabeth, daughter of King Henry VII.\r\n\r\nThe grand monument of Henry V. is inclosed by an iron gate. The great\r\narch over the tomb is full of ribs and panels, and the headless figure\r\nof Henry still remains: the head was of solid silver, and was stolen\r\nduring the civil wars. There was a chantry directly over the tomb, which\r\nhad an altarpiece of fine carved work. The armor of Henry once hung\r\nround this chantry; his helmet yet remains on the bar, and the very\r\nsaddle which he rode at the battle of Agincourt, stripped of everything\r\nwhich composed it, except the wood and iron, hangs on the right.\r\n\r\nContiguous to the eastern extremity of the church, and opening into it,\r\nstands the famous chapel of Henry VII. dedicated to the Virgin Mary, one\r\nof the finest and most highly finished pieces of Gothic architecture in\r\nthe world. On its site formerly stood a chapel, dedicated to the Virgin\r\nMary, and also a tavern, distinguished by the sign of the White Rose.\r\nHenry, resolving to erect a superb mausoleum for himself and his family,\r\npulled down the old chapel and tavern; and on the eleventh of February,\r\n1503, the first stone of the present edifice was laid by Abbot Islip, at\r\nthe command of the king. It cost seventy thousand dollars, a prodigious\r\nsum for that period, (equal to fourteen hundred thousand dollars of our\r\nmoney;) and still more so, considering the parsimonious temper of the\r\nking. The labor merely of working the materials will, at a glance, be\r\nseen to be immense, and almost incredible; and the genius employed both\r\nin this structure and Henry’s tomb, must be mentioned with admiration.\r\n\r\nThe exterior of this chapel is remarkable for the richness and variety\r\nof its form, occasioned chiefly by fourteen towers, in an elegant\r\nproportion to the body of the edifice, and projecting in different\r\nangles from the outermost wall. It has of late years been repaired and\r\nrenewed with exquisite taste, and at great cost. The inside is\r\napproached by the area behind the chapels of Edward the Confessor and\r\nHenry V. The floor is elevated above that of the area, and the ascent is\r\nby a flight of marble steps. The entrance is ornamented with a beautiful\r\nGothic portico of stone, within which are three large gates of gilt\r\nbrass, of most curious open workmanship, every panel being adorned with\r\na rose and a portcullis alternately.\r\n\r\nThe chapel consists of the nave and two small aisles. The center is\r\nninety-nine feet in length, sixty-six in breadth, and fifty-four in\r\nhight, and terminates at the east in a curve, having five deep recesses\r\nof the same form. The entrance to these recesses being by open arches,\r\nthey add greatly to the relief and beauty of the building. It is\r\nprobable that they were originally so many smaller chapels, destined to\r\nvarious uses. The side aisles are in a just proportion to the center,\r\nwith which they communicate by four arches, turned on Gothic pillars.\r\nEach of them is relieved by four recesses, a window running the whole\r\nhight of each recess, and being most minute and curious in its\r\ndivisions. The upper part of the nave has its four windows on each side,\r\nand ten at the eastern extremity, five above and five below. The entire\r\nroof of the chapel, including the side aisles, and the curve at the end,\r\nis of wrought stone, in the Gothic style, and of most exquisite beauty.\r\n\r\nAn altar tomb, erected by Henry, at the cost of fifty thousand dollars,\r\nto receive his last remains, stands in the center of the chapel. It is\r\nof basaltic stone, ornamented with gilt brass, and is surrounded with a\r\nmagnificent railing of the same. This monument is by Pietro Torregiano,\r\na Florentine sculptor, and possesses uncommon merit. Six devices in\r\nbass-relief, and four statues, all of gilt brass, adorn the tomb. It is\r\nimpossible to conceive Gothic beauty of a higher degree than the whole\r\nof the interior of Henry the Seventh’s chapel; and it is with regret\r\nthat the antiquary sees the stalls of the knights reared against the\r\npillars and arches of the nave, forming screens that separate the\r\nsmaller aisles from the body of the chapel, and diminish the airiness,\r\nand interrupt the harmony of the plan. Since its restoration in 1820,\r\nthis chapel has formed one of the most beautiful adjuncts of the abbey,\r\naffording one of the most beautiful specimens of its peculiar style.\r\n\r\nThe prospect from the top of one of the western towers, the ascent to\r\nwhich consists of two hundred and eighty-three steps, is infinitely more\r\nbeautiful, though less extensive, than that from St. Paul’s. The many\r\nfine situations and open sites at the west end of the town, and its\r\nenvirons, occasion the difference. The banqueting-house at Whitehall,\r\nSt. James’s park, with the parade and Horse-guards, Carlton house, the\r\ngardens of the queen’s palace, the Green park, the western end of\r\nPiccadilly, and Hyde park, with its river, lie at once under the eye,\r\nand compose a most grand and delightful scene. The bridges of\r\nWestminster, Waterloo, and Blackfriars, with the broad expanse of water\r\nbetween them, the Adelphi and Somerset house on its banks, St. Paul’s\r\nstupendous pile, and the light Gothic steeple of St. Dunstan’s in the\r\nEast, are alike embraced with one glance, and happily contrast with the\r\nformer prospect. From this tower, the exterior form of St. Paul’s, when\r\nthe sun falls upon it, is distinctly seen: and here its exquisite beauty\r\nwill be more fully comprehended than in any part of the city, for a\r\nsufficient area to take in the entire outline is not there to be found.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        CATHEDRAL OF NOTRE DAME.\r\n\r\nPassing from England to the continent, one of the first church edifices\r\nthat attracts attention, both as to its antiquity and grandeur, is the\r\ncathedral of Notre Dame, in Paris. This vast erection of world-wide\r\nfame, stands on an island in the Seine, where was the center of the old\r\ncity of the Parisii in the days of Julius Cæsar. It is a cruciform\r\nstructure, four hundred and forty-two feet long, one hundred and\r\nsixty-two wide, and more than one hundred feet high to the vaulting of\r\nthe roof, having all the characteristics of a vast ancient Gothic\r\ncathedral. It was begun in the year 1010, and was nearly four hundred\r\nyears in building, not being finished till 1407. At the west end are two\r\nlofty towers, each two hundred and thirty-five feet high, designed as\r\nbases for steeples, which as yet have never been added. The inside of\r\nthe church has a very splendid and imposing appearance, owing to its\r\nnumerous aisles and chapels; and the west front, with its three large\r\ngates, and circular window, and noble gateway, is worthy of the highest\r\nadmiration. In its imposing appearance, no church in Paris will compare\r\nwith it.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          STRASBURG CATHEDRAL.\r\n\r\nBut by far the most magnificent church edifice in all France, is the\r\ncathedral of Strasburg, a view of which is given in the cut, and which\r\nis famous all over the world. Till the time of Louis XIV., Strasburg was\r\na free imperial city; but he seized, and the French have for one hundred\r\nand fifty years held it, as a frontier fortress, and the key to Germany.\r\nIn the city there are many objects of interest, one of the most\r\nconspicuous of which is a colossal bronze statue of John Guttenberg, who\r\nhere first practiced the art of printing; another is a colossal bronze\r\nmonument, in honor of General Kleber; and still another is a beautiful\r\nmonument to the memory of Marshal Saxe. But the wonder of the city is\r\nthe cathedral, the spire of which rises four hundred and seventy-four\r\nfeet above the pavement, which is nearly as high as the great pyramid of\r\nEgypt, and one hundred and forty feet higher than St. Paul’s. Still,\r\nowing to the large dimensions of the building, and the light and\r\ngraceful structure of the spire, it does not impress the observer as\r\nbeing of this extraordinary altitude. The nave of the church is two\r\nhundred and thirty feet high, and the round window at the end is\r\nforty-eight feet in diameter. This wonderful structure was begun nearly\r\neight hundred years ago. The material is red sandstone, obtained in the\r\nvicinity, which has proved very enduring; the church has therefore\r\nsuffered very little from time, and the chiseled and carved material,\r\nafter so many centuries of exposure to the weather, retains the\r\nsharpness of outline which it had when first finished.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STRASBURG CATHEDRAL.]\r\n\r\nThe artist who designed this admirable masterpiece of airy open-work,\r\nwas Erwin, of Steinbach: his plans are still preserved in the town. He\r\ndied in 1318, when the work was only half finished: it was continued by\r\nhis son, and afterward by his daughter Sabina. The tower, begun 1277,\r\nwas not completed till 1439, long after their deaths, and four hundred\r\nand twenty-four years after the church was commenced. It was then\r\nfinished by John Hültz, of Cologne, who was summoned to Strasburg for\r\nthis end. Had the original design been carried into execution, both the\r\ntowers would have been raised to the same hight. A doorway, in the south\r\nside of the truncated tower, leads to the summit of the spire. On the\r\nplatform, about two-thirds of the way up, is a telegraph, and a station\r\nfor the watchmen, who are set to look out for fires. One of them will\r\naccompany those who wish to mount the upper spire, and will unlock the\r\niron gate which closes the passage. There is no difficulty or danger in\r\nthe ascent, to a person of ordinary nerve or steadiness of head; but the\r\nstone-work of the steeple is so completely open, and the pillars which\r\nsupport it are so wide apart, and cut so thin, that they more nearly\r\nresemble a collection of bars of iron or wood; so that at such a hight\r\none might almost fancy one’s self in a cage, high up, over the city,\r\nrather than in the steeple of a church that has stood firm for ages.\r\n\r\nThe cathedral, as already said, was intended to have two towers, like\r\nthose of the cathedrals of York and Westminster, in England; but as the\r\nexpense is enormous, it is probable that the existing tower will remain\r\nsolitary. This deficiency gives the building a disfigured appearance,\r\nespecially as the unfinished tower, which is square, rises but half-way.\r\nExternally, Strasburg cathedral is distinguished by a light and airy\r\ngracefulness, both of structure and material; the sandstone is cut and\r\ncarved into a thousand forms, some of them, especially in the finished\r\ntower, extremely delicate and beautiful. Even the statues and images,\r\nwhich are very numerous, are chiseled out of sandstone, which has an\r\nagreeable color of reddish gray. There is not an image of marble upon\r\nthe whole building. The number of images that cluster around the portal\r\nand adhere to its walls is very great: they form a host of little\r\nbeings, in addition to the statues of full size. Indeed, the profusion\r\nof these decorations appears to be extravagant both in point of taste\r\nand economy, and some are quite out of place. In a temple, a building\r\ndevoted to religion, it is not easy to understand the propriety of\r\nmounting men on horseback high up in the towers; for such aerial\r\nequestrians are to be seen here, sentinel-like, in positions where\r\nsaints and angels would seem more appropriate ornaments. In the interior\r\nof this cathedral there is a simple dignity and grandeur, a holy majesty\r\nthat is almost overpowering. The magnificent rows of columns of gigantic\r\ndimensions and altitude, seen in long perspective, exceed in effect all\r\nwe can well imagine. The extreme richness of the windows, filled on both\r\nsides with stained glass, commemorating, both historically and\r\nallegorically, the events of the Bible, and the characters and\r\ncatastrophes of saints and martyrs, fills both the eye and the mind with\r\ndelight; and when we turn from gazing to the right and the left along\r\nthe extended line of lateral windows, and look upon the vast circle of\r\ngorgeous light which streams down from the great picture luminary at the\r\nend, (a circular window forty-eight feet in diameter, and presenting, in\r\nradiating lines, more than the colors of the rainbow,) we are ready to\r\nexclaim that Art has not fallen short of Nature in beauty, while she\r\nexcels her in the permanency of her hues, which have not here been\r\ndimmed by the lapse of centuries; and if no violence is committed on\r\nthis temple, they will be equally brilliant after a thousand years more\r\nshall have passed away.\r\n\r\nThere is in this cathedral a wonderful clock, which has been substituted\r\nfor an older one that has been removed. The present clock was\r\nconstructed by a man who is still living; it appears to be about fifty\r\nfeet high, and more than half that width; it was mute for fifty years,\r\nbut is now again a living chronometer. Among its many performances are\r\nthe following. It tells the hours, half-hours and quarter-hours, and the\r\nbells which make the report of the flight of time, are struck by\r\nautomaton figures. A youth strikes the quarter, a mature man the\r\nhalf-hour, and an old man, as the figure of Time, the full hour. This\r\nclock tells also the times and seasons of ecclesiastical events, as far\r\nas they are associated with astronomical phenomena, and it gives the\r\nphases of the moon and the equation of time. At noon, a cock, mounted on\r\na pillar, crows thrice, when a procession of the apostles comes out, and\r\npasses in view of the Saviour: among them is Peter, who, shrinking from\r\nthe eye of his Lord, shows, by his embarrassed demeanor, that he has\r\nheard the crowing of the cock, and has fully understood its meaning.\r\nAmong the movements of its automatons, is that of a beautiful youth, who\r\nturns an hour-glass every fifteen minutes. There is also a celestial\r\norrery, that shows the motions of the heavenly bodies with great\r\naccuracy and beauty.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         CATHEDRAL OF COLOGNE.\r\n\r\nThe cathedral of Cologne is at once its ornament and its reproach. It\r\nwas begun in 1248 by the elector Conrad, more than six hundred years\r\nago, but it is not yet finished, although the present Prussian king is\r\nexpending vast sums upon it. Since the city has passed under the\r\nPrussian dominion, and more especially since the accession of the\r\npresent king, important aid has been obtained from the government. The\r\nunfinished towers are rising year by year; and if the annual supplies\r\nthat have been granted are continued, another fifteen years may possibly\r\nsee it completed. The estimated expense of finishing it is five million\r\ndollars. It is considered as a very fine specimen of the Gothic\r\narchitecture. One tower, that on the front, is completed. This cathedral\r\nis exceedingly gorgeous in decorations, combining all the features that\r\nbelong to that species of architecture. The choir is finished, and\r\nexceeds in splendid beauty almost everything of the kind which the\r\ntraveler will meet with in Europe. It is very rich in stained glass, and\r\nthis is true also of the body of the church. Much of the pictured glass\r\nis modern: it is set in the same window with the ancient, and is not\r\ninferior to it in splendor. The cathedral is paved with rude, common\r\nstones, doubtless intended to be temporary only, and to be in due time\r\nreplaced by marble. It was originally intended that the towers of this\r\ncathedral should be five hundred feet high. The dimensions on the ground\r\nare four hundred feet by one hundred and eighty. The nave is supported\r\nby one hundred columns, of which the middle ones are forty feet in\r\ncircumference.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     CHURCH OF ST. MARK, AT VENICE.\r\n\r\nThis splendid old church has well been described as “a stupendous pile\r\nof oriental magnificence.” A thousand years do not cover the whole\r\nperiod of its existence. It is adorned with the columns and gems of the\r\neast, and no wonder, for every Venetian captain of a ship and every\r\ntraveler of that nation was required to bring home something to adorn\r\nthis temple: Greece and Constantinople, Palestine and all Europe, have\r\ncontributed to its embellishment. It is totally unlike almost every\r\nother temple. It has round arches and regular domes, and from every part\r\nof them, there look down upon you, in permanent mosaic of gold and\r\ncolored stones, and even precious gems, colossal images of the Saviour,\r\nof the virgin mother, of apostles and saints, and of multiform beings of\r\nreligious allegory, so numerous and various, and so fresh, rich, and\r\ngorgeous, that you are quite bewildered, and involuntarily drop your\r\neyes to the floor, where you are almost equally dazzled by the precious\r\nmarbles, and jaspers, and serpentines, and verd-antique, and red\r\nporphyry, disposed in endless variety of most beautiful patterns, as if\r\nit had been the work of a magician artist. You read there also the\r\ninstability of human glory in the worn and mutilated condition of parts\r\nof the pavement, and in the waving hollows and upward curves which prove\r\nthat its foundations were laid in the sea. You again lift your eyes, and\r\nin the permanent mosaics (for no perishable frescoes or oil paintings\r\nare here) you read in large and distinct historical figures the early\r\nBible history of our race, and the annals of the patriarchal families.\r\nAround the church, hang rich lamps of silver and gold. Huge candles and\r\nlights perpetually burning, symbolize the immortality of the soul.\r\nPassing out of the church, precious columns are on your right and on\r\nyour left, columns of marble and porphyry brought from Constantinople,\r\nand Jerusalem, and St. Jean d’Acre. Lifting your eyes again to the roof,\r\nyou there see domes, and dome upon dome; minarets and carvings in\r\narabesque, and other rich forms of oriental architecture, with images\r\nand statues innumerable, standing as sentinels on all the cornices and\r\nangles, and in the niches.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        THE CATHEDRAL OF MILAN.\r\n\r\nPassing on to the last of the church edifices to be described, we come\r\nto the cathedral of Milan. A good picture is necessary to give even a\r\nfaint impression of the richness and harmonious proportions of this\r\nwonderful building; but it is possible, from description, to form a\r\ncorrect conception of its magnitude, and of its principal parts. Its\r\nlength is four hundred and eighty-five feet; breadth, two hundred and\r\nfifty-two; breadth across the transepts, two hundred and eighty-seven\r\nfeet; hight of the nave, one hundred and fifty-three feet. The hight\r\nfrom the pavement to the top of the crown of the Madonna, on the summit\r\nof the spire, is three hundred and fifty-five feet. This cathedral is\r\none of the most stupendous piles ever erected; but it is not yet\r\nfinished, although it has been almost five hundred years in building.\r\nSeveral duomos have been destroyed that once occupied this place. The\r\nfirst cathedral was destroyed by Attila in the fifth century; the second\r\nwas burnt by accident in 1075; and the third was partially ruined by\r\nFrederic Barbarossa. A lofty bell-tower, demolished by him, crushed the\r\nduomo in its fall. The first stone of the present cathedral was laid in\r\nMarch, 1386, by G. G. Visconti.\r\n\r\nThe interior presents a wilderness of columns, some of which are almost\r\ntwelve feet in diameter at the base, and more than eight in the shaft.\r\nFifty-two pillars, of the hight of eighty feet, support the pointed\r\narches on which the roof rests. The exterior shows equally a wilderness\r\nof statues and pinnacles. Each pinnacle, if placed on the ground, would\r\nappear a considerable spire. The statues already in place number three\r\nthousand, and forty-live hundred are necessary to carry out the plan.\r\nEach pinnacle or minaret is crowned by a statue, and there are many more\r\nin the niches, among the pinnacles, as well as in other situations. In\r\norder to become acquainted with them, you must ascend to the roof, and\r\nthen you will see life and meaning in them all; if seen from below, they\r\nappear indeed as a multitude of statues in marble, but without any\r\nobvious design. Whatever the moral may be, it is exhibited at an immense\r\nexpense of treasure; but, in Italy, it is a national passion, which has\r\ncome down to them from the Romans, to people their ideal world with\r\nmarble forms, commemorating those who once lived on earth, or the\r\nimaginary beings of allegory and of a fabulous mythology. In this\r\ncathedral, in addition to statues of the size of life or beyond its\r\ndimensions, there are many of inferior magnitude: little pretty cherubs\r\nand imaginative beings are seen, single or in clusters. In all parts of\r\nthe building, there are delicate and elaborately wrought carvings in\r\nmarble, and even in situations where they can not be seen except by a\r\ndiligent explorer. Ascending to the roof of the cathedral, and walking\r\nover it, the traveler will observe that it is composed of massive blocks\r\nof marble accurately adjusted to each other, and although the weight is\r\nimmense, no cracks are visible. One moves as freely upon the roof, and\r\nwith as much confidence as if a mountain of marble were beneath his\r\nfeet; and the view from it is as glorious as it could be from a mountain\r\nrearing its lofty head in place of this structure reared by the art of\r\nman!\r\n\r\n\r\n                          THE TOWER OF LONDON.\r\n\r\nThe Tower of London was anciently a palace occupied by the various\r\nsovereigns of England, till the reign of Queen Elizabeth. It was begun\r\nby William the Conqueror in 1073; and additions were made to it by\r\nseveral of the later monarchs. The extent within the walls is over\r\ntwelve acres; and the exterior circuit of the ditch that surrounds it is\r\nover three thousand feet. A broad and handsome wharf, or gravel terrace,\r\nruns along the banks of the river parallel with the Tower, from which it\r\nis separated by the ditch.\r\n\r\nWithin the walls of the Tower are several streets; and a variety of\r\nbuildings, the principal of which are, the church, the white tower, the\r\nordnance office, the record office, the jewel office, the horse armory,\r\nthe grand storehouse, the small armory, the houses belonging to the\r\nofficers of the tower, barracks for the garrison, &c.\r\n\r\nThe white tower, which was the original building, is a large square\r\nstructure, situated in the center of the fortress. On the top are four\r\nwatch-towers, one of which, at present, is used as an observatory. It\r\nconsists within of three lofty stories, beneath which are large,\r\ncommodious vaults. In the first story are two grand rooms, one of which\r\nis a small armory for the sea-service, and contains various sorts of\r\narms, curiously laid up, which would serve upward of ten thousand\r\nseamen. In the other rooms, in closets and presses, are abundance of\r\nwarlike tools and instruments of death. In the upper stories, are arms\r\nand armorers’ tools. The models of all newly invented engines of\r\ndestruction, which have been presented to the government, are preserved\r\nin this tower. On the top is a large cistern, filled from the Thames by\r\na water-engine, to supply the garrison with water. The grand storehouse,\r\nwhich stands north of the white tower, is a plain building of brick and\r\nstone, three hundred and forty-five feet long and sixty feet broad. The\r\njewel office is a little to the east of the grand storehouse. It is a\r\ndark and strong stone room. The horse armory is a brick building\r\neastward of the white tower. The record office is in the Wakefield\r\ntower, opposite the platform. The rolls from the time of King John to\r\nthe beginning of the reign of Richard III., are kept here in fifty-six\r\nwainscot presses. They contain the ancient tenures of land in England,\r\nthe original laws and statutes, the rights of England to the dominion of\r\nthe British seas, the forms of submission of the Scottish kings, and a\r\nvariety of other records, &c. The principal entrance to the Tower is on\r\nthe west. It consists of two gates on the outside of the ditch; a stone\r\nbridge built over the ditch, and a gate within the ditch. On the right\r\nhand, at the west entrance, the menagerie was formerly kept; but having\r\nbeen superseded by that belonging to the Zoölogical Society in the\r\nRegent’s park, it was broken up a few years ago. What was called the\r\nSpanish armory, contains the trophies of the famous victory of Queen\r\nElizabeth over the Spanish armada. Among these the most remarkable are\r\nthe thumb-screws, intended to be used to extort confession from the\r\nEnglish where their money was hidden. In the same room are other\r\ncuriosities; among which is the ax with which the unfortunate Anne\r\nBoleyn was beheaded, to gratify the capricious passions of her husband,\r\nHenry VIII. A representation of Queen Elizabeth in armor, standing by a\r\ncream-colored horse, attended by a page, is also shown in this room. Her\r\nmajesty is dressed in the armor she wore at the time she addressed her\r\narmy in the camp of Tilbury, 1588, with a white silk petticoat,\r\nornamented with pearls and spangles.\r\n\r\nThe small armory is one of the finest rooms of its kind in Europe. It is\r\nthree hundred and forty-five feet in length, and in general it contains\r\ncomplete stands of arms for no less than one hundred thousand men. They\r\nare disposed in a variety of figures, in a very elegant manner. Among\r\nthem is a piece of ordnance from Egypt, sixteen feet long, and seven\r\ninches and a half bore. There are several other curiosities, among which\r\nare arms taken at various periods from rebels; the Highland broad-sword\r\ndeserves particular notice. In many respects this room may be considered\r\nas one of the wonders of the modern world. The volunteer armory is in\r\nthe white tower, and contains arms, piled in beautiful order, for thirty\r\nthousand men, with pikes, swords, &c., in immense numbers, arranged in\r\nstars and other devices. At the entrance of this room stands a fine\r\nfigure of Charles Brandon, Duke of Suffolk in the time of Henry VIII.,\r\nin bright armor, and having the very lance he used in his lifetime,\r\nwhich is eighteen feet long. The sea armory is also in this tower, and\r\ncontains arms for nearly fifty thousand sailors and marines. In this\r\nroom are two elegant pieces of brass cannon, presented by the city of\r\nLondon to the Earl of Leicester, and various similar curiosities. Part\r\nof the royal train of artillery is kept on the ground-floor, under the\r\nsmall armory. The room is three hundred and eighty feet long, fifty feet\r\nwide, and twenty-four in hight. The artillery is ranged on each side, a\r\npassage ten feet in breadth being left in the center. In this room are\r\ntwenty pillars that support the small armory above, which are hung round\r\nwith implements of war, and trophies taken from the enemy. There are\r\nmany peculiarly fine pieces of cannon to be seen here: one (of brass) is\r\nsaid to have cost two hundred pounds in ornamenting. It was made for\r\nPrince Henry, eldest son of James I. Others are extremely curious for\r\ntheir antiquity. Among them is one of the first invented cannon. It is\r\nformed of bars of iron hammered together, and bound with iron hoops. It\r\nhas no carriage, but was moved by six rings, conveniently placed for\r\nthat purpose. The horse armory is a noble room, crowded with\r\ncuriosities. The armor of John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster, and son of\r\nEdward III., is seven feet in hight. The sword and lance are of a\r\nproportionable size. A complete suit of armor, rough from the hammer,\r\nmade for Henry VIII. when eighteen years old, is six feet high. The\r\nkings of England on horseback, are shown in armor, from the Conqueror to\r\nGeorge II.\r\n\r\nThe jewel office contains: 1. _The imperial crown_, with which the kings\r\nof England are crowned. It is of gold, enriched with diamonds, rubies,\r\nemeralds, sapphires and pearls; within is a cap of purple velvet, lined\r\nwith white taffeta, and turned up with three rows of ermine. This is\r\nnever used but at coronations, and of course is not often produced. 2.\r\n_The golden globe._ This is put into the king’s right-hand before he is\r\ncrowned; and when he is crowned, he bears it in his left-hand, having\r\nthe scepter in his right. 3. _The golden scepter_ and its cross, upon a\r\nlarge amethyst, decorated with table diamonds. 4. _The ancient scepter_,\r\ncovered with jewels and Gothic enamel work, and surmounted with an onyx\r\ndove. This scepter is believed to be far the most ancient in the\r\ncollection, and probably is a part of the original regalia. It was found\r\nby the keeper in 1814, exactly at the time of the general peace. It is\r\nestimated at a very high value. 5. _St. Edward’s staff._ It is four feet\r\nseven inches and a half long, and three inches and three-quarters round,\r\nmade of beaten gold. It is borne before the king in the coronation\r\nprocession. 6. _The gold salt-cellar of state._ In make it is the model\r\nof the square white tower, and is of excellent workmanship. At the\r\ncoronation it is placed on the king’s table. 7. _The sword of mercy._ It\r\nhas no point. 8. _A grand silver font_, used for christenings of the\r\nroyal family. 9. _The crown of state_, which is worn by the sovereign at\r\nthe meeting of parliament, and other state occasions. It is of extreme\r\nsplendor and value, being covered with large-sized precious stones, and\r\non the top of its cross is a pearl which Charles I. pledged to the Dutch\r\nrepublic for eighteen thousand pounds. Under the cross is an emerald\r\ndiamond of a pale green color, seven inches and a half in circumference,\r\nand valued at one hundred thousand pounds; and in the front is a rock\r\nruby, unpolished, in its purely natural state, three inches long, and\r\nthe value of which can not be estimated. 10. _The golden eagle_, with\r\nwhich the king is anointed, and the _golden spur_. 11. _The diadem_,\r\nworn by the Queens Anne and Mary. 12. _The crown_ of Queen Mary, _the\r\ncross_ of King William, and many other valuable jewels. In this office\r\nare all the crown jewels worn by the princes and princesses at\r\ncoronations, and abundance of curious old plate. Independently of\r\nseveral of the jewels which are inestimable, the value of the precious\r\nstones and plate contained in this office, is not less than two millions\r\nsterling. The chapel, situated at the north end of the parade, is not\r\notherwise attractive, than as it contains a few ancient tombs and\r\nmonuments.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          THE BANK OF ENGLAND.\r\n\r\nThe building thus entitled is an immense and very extensive stone\r\nedifice, situated a little to the north-west of Cornhill. Until 1825,\r\nthis edifice exhibited a great variety of incongruous styles of\r\narchitecture; but endeavors have since been made, and with success, to\r\nproduce more uniformity of appearance. On the east side of the principal\r\nentrance, is a passage leading to a spacious apartment called the\r\nrotunda, fifty-seven feet in diameter, in which business in the public\r\nfunds is transacted; and, branching out of this apartment, are various\r\noffices appropriated to the management of each particular stock. In each\r\nof these, under the several letters of the alphabet, are arrayed the\r\nbooks in which the amount of every individual’s interest in such a fund\r\nis registered.\r\n\r\nThe bank of England covers an extent of more than eight acres, and is\r\ncompletely insulated. Its shape is that of an irregular parallelogram,\r\nthe longest side of which measures four hundred and forty feet. Its\r\nexterior is not unsuitable to the nature of the establishment, conveying\r\nthe idea of great strength and security. In the interior, a variety of\r\nalterations and improvements have been made to accommodate the vast\r\nincrease of business and of the paper money and discounting systems.\r\nThis has required considerable enlargements of the offices in every\r\ndepartment, and has led, in the space of thirty or forty years, to the\r\nincrease of the clerks from two hundred to about eleven hundred. The\r\ncapital, or stock, also, of this grand national establishment, has been\r\nconsiderably and progressively augmented, until, from twelve hundred\r\nthousand pounds, it has risen to eleven million, six hundred and\r\nforty-seven thousand, seven hundred and fifty pounds, or nearly sixty\r\nmillion dollars. The direction is vested in a governor, deputy-governor,\r\nand twenty-four directors, all elected annually; and thirteen of the\r\ndirectors, with the governor, form a court for the management of the\r\nbusiness of the institution.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             THE MONUMENT.\r\n\r\nAbout two hundred yards north of London bridge, is situated one of the\r\nfinest pillars in the world, erected by Sir Christopher Wren, in memory\r\nof the great fire, which, in 1666, broke out at a house on this spot,\r\nand destroyed the metropolis from the Tower to Temple Bar. It is a\r\nfluted column of the Doric order; its total hight is two hundred and two\r\nfeet; the diameter at the base is fifteen feet; the hight of the column,\r\none hundred and twenty feet; and the cone at the top, with its urn,\r\nforty-two feet. The hight of the massy pedestal is forty feet. Within\r\nthe column is a flight of three hundred and forty-five steps; and from\r\nthe iron balcony at the top is a most fascinating prospect of the\r\nmetropolis and the adjacent country. It is impossible not to lament the\r\nobscure situation of this beautiful monument, which, in a proper place,\r\nwould form one of the most striking objects of the kind that\r\narchitecture is capable of producing.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              THE LOUVRE.\r\n\r\nThis splendid palace, which was planned in the reign of Francis I., at\r\nthe commencement of the sixteenth century, is a quadrangular edifice,\r\nhaving a court in the center, and forming a square of about four hundred\r\nand sixteen English feet. The front was built in the reign of Louis\r\nXIV., and is one of the most beautiful monuments of his reign. A\r\nspacious gallery, fourteen hundred and fifty English feet in length,\r\nconnects this palace with that of the Tuilleries. Here was displayed,\r\nunder the title of the Musee Napoleon, that inestimable collection of\r\npaintings, one thousand and thirty in number, consisting of the\r\n_chefs-d’œuvre_ of the great masters of antiquity, and constituting a\r\ntreasury of human art and genius, far surpassing every other similar\r\ninstitution. The ante-room leading to the gallery contained several\r\nexquisite paintings, the fruits of the triumphs of Bonaparte, or which\r\nhad been presented to him by the sovereigns who had cultivated his\r\nalliance. This apartment was styled by the Parisians the Nosegay of\r\nBonaparte: its most costly pictures were from the gallery of the Grand\r\nDuke of Tuscany; and to these were added a selection from those procured\r\nat Venice, Naples, Turin and Bologna.\r\n\r\nIt would be impossible adequately to describe the first impressions made\r\non the spectator on his entrance into the gallery, where such a galaxy\r\nof genius and art was offered to his contemplation. It was lined by the\r\nfinest productions of the French, Flemish and Italian schools, and\r\ndivided by a curious double painting upon slate, placed on a pedestal in\r\nthe middle of the room, representing the front and back views of the\r\nsame figures. From the Museum the visitor descends into the Salle des\r\nAntiques, containing the finest treasures of Grecian and Roman statuary.\r\nHis notice is instantly attracted by the Belvidere Apollo, a statue\r\nsurpassing, in the opinion of connoisseurs, all the others in the\r\ncollection. This matchless statue is thus described by Sir John Carr, in\r\nhis work entitled “The Stranger in France.” “All the divinity of a god\r\nbeams through this unrivaled perfection of form. It is impossible to\r\nimpart the impressions which it inspires: the riveted beholder is ready\r\nto exclaim with Adam, when he first discerns the approach of Raphael:\r\n\r\n                       “‘Behold what glorious shape\r\n           Comes this way moving: seems another morn\r\n           Risen on mid-noon; some great behest from heaven.’\r\n\r\n“The imagination can not form such an union of grace and strength. One\r\nof its many transcendent beauties consists in its aerial appearance and\r\nexquisite expression of motion.” The Medicean Venus, from the palace\r\nPitti, at Florence, also formed a part of this magnificent collection of\r\nstatues. The classic Addison, in speaking of this statue, which he saw\r\nat Florence, observes, that it appeared to him much less than life, in\r\nconsequence of its being in the company of others of a larger size; but\r\nthat it is, notwithstanding, as large as the ordinary size of women, as\r\nhe concluded from the measure of the wrist; since, in a figure of such\r\nnice proportions, from the size of any one part it is easy to guess at\r\nthat of the others. The fine polish of the marble, communicating to the\r\ntouch a sensation of fleshy softness, the delicacy of the shape, air and\r\nposture, and the correctness of design, in this celebrated statue, are\r\nnot to be expressed.\r\n\r\nThe Paris museum, and Salle des Antiques, although deprived, at the\r\ntermination of the contest with France, of so many _chefs-d’œuvre_ of\r\nart, still contain others which render them highly interesting. The\r\nfinest productions of Le Brun, several of them on an immense scale,\r\nstill remain; as do likewise the matchless marine paintings by Vernet;\r\nthe truly sublime works of Poussin, consisting of the chief of his\r\nmasterpieces; together with many choice paintings by Rubens, Wouvermans,\r\nDe Witte, &c. Many of the statues remaining in the Salle des Antiques\r\nare likewise admirable specimens of sculpture. In the gallery of the\r\nLouvre a very curious collection of models, representing the fortresses\r\nof France and other countries, was once exhibited; but it was removed,\r\nthat the paintings might be seen with greater effect. These models,\r\nexecuted in the reign of Louis XIV., and amounting to upward of one\r\nhundred and eighty, were wrought with the greatest accuracy, and so\r\nnaturally, as to represent the several cities which they describe, with\r\ntheir streets, houses, squares and churches, together with the works,\r\nmoats, bridges and rivers, not neglecting the adjacent territory, as\r\nconsisting of plains, mountains, corn-lands, meadows, gardens, woods,\r\n&c. Several of these models were so contrived as to be taken in pieces,\r\nso that the curious observer might be better able to perceive their\r\nadmirable construction.\r\n\r\nOf this splendid building and gallery, Silliman, in his late tour, says,\r\n“A mere catalogue of the objects in the Louvre, with the most brief\r\ndescription, would swell to a volume. The building forms part of a vast\r\nunfinished quadrangle, upon the usual plan of ancient castles and\r\npalaces. In various stages of its progress, during many centuries, it\r\nhas been used both as a castle and a palace. From its windows, or from\r\nthe windows of a building occupying the same place, the infamous Charles\r\nIX. fired upon his Protestant subjects during the massacre of St.\r\nBartholomew, August twenty-fourth, 1572, crying, with the voice of a\r\nfiend, ‘Kill! kill!!’\r\n\r\n“The Louvre, as a grand museum of the arts, is indebted chiefly to\r\nNapoleon and Louis Philippe. Even as late as the reign of Louis XVI.,\r\nthe greater part of the Louvre remained without a roof. The magnificent\r\nbronze gates are due to Napoleon. He and Louis Philippe did more for the\r\nembellishment of Paris than any monarch, except Louis XIV. Had we seen\r\nthe Louvre when we were first in Paris, it would have made a much\r\nstronger impression than now; and this remark can be, in a degree,\r\nextended to all its various contents, whether statues, ancient or\r\nmodern, antiquities of various ages and nations, Egyptian, Assyrian,\r\nEtruscan, Grecian, Roman, Mexican, or Peruvian, or of whatever name.\r\nExquisite objects, in curious arts, may be included—cameos, gems,\r\ncrystal vessels, and ornaments. Even at this late period of our tour,\r\nthe Louvre has, however, made a very strong impression. It is a glorious\r\nspectacle: there is no museum that can compare with it, except that of\r\nthe Vatican. The British museum is not a fair subject of comparison with\r\neither of these, as its plan and main objects are different. The Louvre\r\nis strictly a museum of the fine arts and of antiquities. Libraries it\r\nhas not, nor does it include natural history, which is so abundantly\r\nillustrated at the Garden of Plants, and in the other excellent\r\ninstitutions in Paris. That hall of the Louvre which is called the long\r\ngallery is thirteen hundred and thirty-two feet in length, over a\r\nquarter of a mile, and forty-two feet wide, all seen in one view. The\r\nwalls are entirely covered by pictures, amounting in the aggregate to\r\nfourteen hundred and eight, of which three hundred and eighty are\r\nFrench, five hundred and forty are Flemish and German, four hundred and\r\neighty are Italian, and eight are modern copies of ancient pictures.\r\nOnly the works of deceased artists are admitted into this museum, which\r\nwas formed principally by Napoleon, and enriched with most of the\r\n_chefs-d’œuvre_ of Europe. The greater part of those foreign pictures\r\nwere claimed and removed by the allies in 1815; but they are hardly\r\nmissed; for, even now, this gallery is one of the finest in the world.\r\n\r\n“I have already had occasion to remark that in our tour we have seen a\r\nnumber of pictures and statues in various cities, particularly in Italy,\r\nwhich, having traveled to Paris, were restored after the Russian\r\ncampaign and the battle of Waterloo. There were, however, so many fine\r\nthings left behind in the different galleries from which those pictures\r\nhad been taken, that the omission would hardly be noticed there, any\r\nmore than their absence from the Louvre is observed now, except by a few\r\nscrutinizing artists and connoisseurs. In despair of making any progress\r\nin this vast collection, I shall not even attempt to describe any\r\nparticular pictures, and thus I must pass by the grandest gallery\r\nperhaps in the world, because I can not do it any justice, and for a\r\nstill worse reason, because so many galleries of less importance have\r\nbeen visited first. The room called Salle de Bijoux is very rich in the\r\nrare and costly things which kings are wont to collect, and which are\r\nhere so numerous and beautiful that they surpass the similar collections\r\nin the Pitti palace in Florence, but they are inferior in splendor and\r\nmagnificence to those we had lately seen at Dresden. There is here,\r\nhowever, a profusion of gems, diamonds, sapphires, rubies, &c.; and the\r\nvessels fabricated from rock crystal are numerous, large and splendid.\r\nThe Egyptian museum is particularly rich in everything which illustrates\r\nthe history and manners of that country. The gallery of ancient\r\nstatuary, and of modern copies, is so similar to what we have seen in\r\nItaly, that I will not enter into particulars. There is nothing here\r\nmore surprising than the stupendous sculptured stones from Nineveh, sent\r\nout by M. Botta, the French consul. They are not so numerous as in the\r\ncollection which we saw in the British museum, but there are figures\r\nhere which surpass in magnitude any that are there; at least such is my\r\nrecollection. The winged bulls, with a lion’s head, and the figures on\r\nthe reverse of the stone panels, are of such vast size, that we are\r\nastonished that they could have been transported without injury from the\r\nother side of the world. A tall man is a dwarf by their side.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                          THE BRITISH MUSEUM.\r\n\r\nThis grand national collection of antiquities, books and natural\r\ncuriosities, is placed in the noble house formerly belonging to the Duke\r\nof Montagu, in Great Russell street, Bloomsbury. It is a stately\r\nedifice, in the French style of the reign of Louis XIV., and on the plan\r\nof the Tuilleries. The celebrated French architect, Peter Paget, was\r\nsent over from Paris, by Ralph, first Duke of Montagu, expressly to\r\nconstruct this splendid mansion, which is, perhaps, better calculated\r\nfor its present purpose than for a private residence.\r\n\r\nThe British museum was established by act of parliament, in 1753, in\r\nconsequence of the will of Sir Hans Sloane, who left his museum to the\r\nnation, which he declared in his will, cost him upward of fifty thousand\r\npounds, on condition that parliament should pay twenty thousand pounds\r\nto his executors, and purchase a house sufficiently commodious for it.\r\nThe parliament acted with great liberality on this occasion; several\r\nother valuable collections were united to this of Sir Hans Sloane, and\r\nthe whole establishment completed for the sum of eighty-five thousand\r\npounds, which was raised by the way of a lottery. Parliament afterward\r\nadded, at various times, to the Sloanean museum, the Cottonian library;\r\nthat of Major Edwards; the Harleian collection of manuscripts; Sir\r\nWilliam Hamilton’s invaluable collection of Greek vases; the Townleian\r\ncollection of antique marbles; the manuscripts of the Marquis of\r\nLansdowne; and, lastly, the celebrated Elgin marbles, which comprise\r\nwhat are considered as the finest specimens of ancient sculpture. The\r\nwhole of the important library of printed books and manuscripts which\r\nhad been gradually collected by the kings of England from Henry VIII. to\r\nWilliam III., was presented to the museum by George II.; and George III.\r\nbestowed on it a numerous collection of valuable pamphlets, which had\r\nbeen published in the interval between 1640 and 1660. His majesty\r\nlikewise contributed the two finest mummies in Europe; the sum of eleven\r\nhundred and twenty-three pounds, arising from lottery prizes, which had\r\nbelonged to his royal predecessor; and, in 1772, a complete set of the\r\njournals of the lords and commons. To these contributions he afterward\r\nadded a collection of natural and artificial curiosities, sent to him,\r\nin 1796, by Mr. Menzies, from the north-west coast of America, and\r\nseveral single books of great value and utility. The trustees have at\r\nvarious times added Greenwood’s collection of stuffed birds; Hatchet’s\r\nminerals; Halhed’s oriental manuscripts; Tyssen’s collection of Saxon\r\ncoins; Doctor Bentley’s classics; and the Greville collection of\r\nminerals. To these may be added numerous donations from several of the\r\nsovereigns of Europe, as well as from learned bodies and private\r\nindividuals, including the splendid monuments from Nineveh, and other\r\nwonderful and curious contributions that will be mentioned.\r\n\r\nThe building itself is a spacious quadrangle of some two thousand feet,\r\nor nearly two-fifths of a mile in circuit, occupying a large part of\r\nGreat Russel square; and even now, greatly enlarged as it has been, it\r\nis quite inadequate for the growing demands for space in all\r\ndepartments. The ground-floor consists of twelve main rooms, and\r\ncontains the library of printed books. The first room of the upper story\r\ncontains modern works of art from all parts of the world, arranged in\r\ncases. In the one in the center are several beautiful miniatures, among\r\nwhich are those of Sir Thomas More, Charles I., and Oliver Cromwell, the\r\nlatter having his watch placed by its side. Two curious portraits of\r\nWilliam III. and Queen Mary, are carved on two walnut-shells. In the\r\npresses are arranged, in geographical order, some fine specimens of\r\nChina, and a variety of implements of war from different quarters of the\r\nglobe. Here is to be seen the rich collection of curiosities from the\r\nSouth Pacific ocean, brought by Captain Cook. In the left corner is the\r\nmourning dress of an Otaheitan lady, in which taste and barbarity are\r\nsingularly blended; and opposite, are the rich cloaks and helmets of\r\nfeathers from the Sandwich islands. Among these is one, which, in\r\nelegance of form, vies even with the Grecian helmets. In another case\r\nare the cava bowls, and above them battoons, and other weapons of war.\r\nThe next objects of attention are the idols of the different islands,\r\npresenting in their hideous rudeness, a singular contrast with many of\r\nthe works of art formed by the same people; near these are the drums and\r\nother instruments of music, and a breast-plate from the Friendly\r\nislands. The ceiling of this room, or vestibule, represents the fall of\r\nPhæton.\r\n\r\nThe second room consists of similar objects. The third is devoted to the\r\nLansdowne collection of manuscripts, which have been handsomely bound\r\nand lettered. In the fourth are the Sloanean and Birchean collections of\r\nmanuscripts. The fifth contains part of the Harleian library of\r\nmanuscripts, and the sixth, the first part of the same, and additions\r\nmade since the establishment of the museum. The seventh is appropriated\r\nto the royal and Cottonian library of manuscripts. On a table, in a\r\nglazed frame, is the original of the Magna Charta, belonging to the\r\nCottonian library. Against the press, number twenty-one, of the\r\nCottonian collection, is the original of the articles preparatory to the\r\nsigning of the great charter, perfect, with the seal. The magnificent\r\nsaloon is filled with the Greville collection of minerals, the finest in\r\nthe world, admirably arranged, and luminously colored. The dome of this\r\nsaloon merits notice. It was painted by La Fosse, and has been described\r\nas the apotheosis of Iris, or birth of Minerva. In the middle of the\r\nwindow stands a table, composed of a variety of lavas from Mount\r\nVesuvius, presented by the Earl of Exeter. The eighth room contains a\r\ndepartment of natural history, part of which is the valuable donation of\r\nMr. Cracherode, disposed in two tables, nearly in the Linnæan order; and\r\na much more extensive series, arranged according to the Wernerian\r\nsystem. The principal productions are very valuable, consisting of\r\nminerals from Derbyshire, Siberia, the South seas, volcanic and rock\r\nstones from Germany, &c. One very curious specimen of natural history is\r\npointed out in the fifth division of the Cracherodean collection, an\r\negg-shaped piece of chalcedony, containing water, which may be seen by\r\ngently shaking the vase. Here, also, in a glass case, is the famous\r\nfossil skeleton from Gaudaloupe, which has been the object of much\r\ninteresting controversy among eminent naturalists. The ninth is\r\nappropriated to petrifactions and shells. In the first division of the\r\ncases in the middle of the room, is a valuable univalve shell, of the\r\nspecies called the paper nautilus, or argonaut shells, remarkable for\r\nthe slightness of its fabric, and the elegance of its shape. It is\r\ninhabited by an animal not unlike a cuttle-fish, which by extending a\r\npair of membranes, adhering to the top of its longest arms, has the\r\npower of sailing on the surface of the sea. Under the tables are\r\ndeposited, in this and the next room, a great number of volumes and\r\nparcels, containing collections of dried plants; which, from the fragile\r\nnature of their contents, are shown only on particular leave. The tenth\r\nroom is entirely filled with vegetable productions, zoöphytes, sponges,\r\n&c. The contents of the eleventh room are birds, and arranged as far as\r\nconvenience would admit, according to the Linnæan system. Among the\r\ncurious specimens of ornithology is a humming-bird, scarcely larger than\r\na bee; also another beautiful little creature called the harlequin\r\nhumming-bird, from the variety of its colors. In this room there is a\r\ncurious picture, executed many years ago in Holland, of that extremely\r\nrare and curious bird, the dodo, belonging to the tribe _gallinæ_. In\r\nthe table in the middle are preserved the nests of several birds, among\r\nthe most curious of which are several hanging nests, chiefly formed by\r\nbirds of the oriole tribe; nests of a substance resembling isinglass,\r\nwhich the Chinese make into a rich soup; scarce feathers, &c. In the\r\nsecond table are deposited a variety of eggs and nests: among the former\r\nmay be noticed the eggs of the ostrich, the cassowary, the crocodile,\r\n&c. In the cases between the windows are several of the rarer\r\nquadrupeds; among these the most curious are, two orang-outangs, in a\r\nyoung state, a long-tailed macauco, ermine, &c.; in cases under the\r\ntables are an armadillo, or porcupine, several young sloths, and a fine\r\nspecimen of the two-toed ant-eater. The twelfth room contains a general\r\nand extensive arrangement of fishes, serpents, lizards, frogs, &c.\r\n\r\nThe Townley marbles and Egyptian antiquities, are deposited in a very\r\nelegant suite of rooms built purposely for them. The first room is\r\ndevoted to a collection of bass-reliefs, in _terra cotta_, pronounced\r\nthe finest in Europe. The second is a beautiful circular room, whence\r\nyou have a fine view of the whole suite of apartments, bounded at the\r\nend by an exquisitely-wrought _discobolon_, or ancient quoit-player.\r\nThis room is devoted to Greek and Roman sculptures, among which may be\r\npointed out a fine candelabrum, with several beautiful busts and\r\nstatues. The third and fourth rooms are also filled with Greek and Roman\r\nsculptures: in the latter are several fine bass-reliefs. The fifth\r\ncontains a collection of Roman sepulchral monuments, and a beautiful\r\nmosaic pavement, discovered in digging the foundations for a new\r\nbuilding at the bank of England. The sixth exhibits a miscellaneous\r\ncollection of one hundred grand pieces of Roman and Greek sculpture. The\r\nseventh is devoted to Roman antiquities, and the eighth, on the left, to\r\nEgyptian antiquities, among which are the two mummies before mentioned,\r\nwith their coffins; a manuscript, or papyrus, taken from a mummy, &c.\r\nAmong the Egyptian sculptures in the ninth room, is the celebrated\r\nsarcophagus, commonly called the tomb of Alexander the Great, an\r\nengraving and dissertation on which appeared in the Monthly Magazine for\r\nFebruary, 1809. The tenth contains Greek and Roman sculptures of\r\nsingular beauty.\r\n\r\nThence returning, and proceeding up stairs, the visitor is conducted to\r\nthe eleventh room, containing ancient and modern coins and medals,\r\narranged in geographical order, those of each country being kept\r\nseparate. It is not shown unless by the permission of the trustees, or\r\nof the principal librarian. Not more than two persons are admitted at\r\none time, without the presence of the principal librarian, or of some\r\nother officer. The twelfth room contains the collection of the late Sir\r\nWilliam Hamilton, which has been removed from the saloon. It principally\r\nconsists of penates, or household gods, bronze vessels, utensils, &c.,\r\nspecimens of ancient glass, necklaces, bullæ, fragments of relievos, and\r\nancient armor, tripods, knives, patent lamps, seals, weights, sculpture\r\nin ivory, bracelets, bits, spurs, ancient paintings from Herculaneum,\r\nBabylonish bricks, and his unrivaled collection of Greek vases, the\r\ngreater part of which were found in the sepulchers of Magna Grecia. The\r\nforms of the vases are much varied, and are equally simple and\r\nbeautiful. In the thirteenth is deposited the extensive and valuable\r\ncollection of prints and drawings, the most important part of which was\r\nbequeathed by the Rev. William Cracherode. The contents of this room can\r\nbe seen only by a few persons at a time, by particular permission.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the various curiosities enumerated above, Professor\r\nSilliman mentions many others which have been contributed to the museum\r\nmore recently; and more fully describes some already noticed. “Here,” he\r\nsays, “is a rich collection of Etruscan vases, from the cemeteries of\r\nthe ancient inhabitants of Italy, who preceded the Roman empire. A part\r\nof this collection was deposited by the Prince de Canino, son of Lucien\r\nBonaparte. The Maltese are now the only people who fabricate ware like\r\nthe ancient Etruscan. Through the kindness of a gentleman attached to\r\nthe museum, we were permitted to see the original Portland vase. It is\r\nof moderate dimensions. The material, contrary to my former impression,\r\nis glass, and not earthen-ware. The basis was dark blue, almost black,\r\nand in the manner of the modern Bohemian glass, it appears to have been\r\ndipped into a semi-transparent white enamel, which gave it an exterior\r\ncoating of that color. This was then cut away, so as to leave the\r\nexquisitely wrought figures of the human form by which it is adorned. It\r\nwas successfully imitated by the late Mr. Wedgwood, in his peculiar\r\nporcelain, but it has never been surpassed in beauty of model, or in the\r\nperfection of its decorations. Mr. Wedgwood’s copies cost fifty pounds\r\neach, which, even with a large subscription, did not reimburse him. Mr.\r\nWebber, the artist, received fifty pounds for modeling it. The original\r\nwas discovered in the tomb of Alexander Severus, who died as early as\r\nthe year 235, and the Duchess of Portland paid one thousand guineas for\r\nit; hence it was called the Portland vase. It will appear incredible\r\nthat any one should be willing to destroy such a gem of art; still, a\r\nfew years ago, a man who was believed to be either drunk or insane,\r\n(very probably both,) hurled a stone at it, and shivered the beautiful\r\nantique into fragments. A fac-simile of the vase, as it lay in ruins, is\r\npreserved in a glazed frame in the room. But by great care and skill,\r\nthe fragments have been reunited, and cemented together, so that the\r\njoinings can be perceived only by a near approach. The culprit was\r\nimprisoned for two years; and a law being afterward made to fit such\r\ncases, (_ex post facto_, perhaps,) he is, I believe, not yet liberated,\r\nand, certainly, ought not to be, without satisfactory evidence of a\r\nsounder state of mind. In the same room with the Portland vase is a rich\r\ncollection of antique ornaments in gold. They are personal ornaments,\r\nEtruscan, Roman, British, Saxon, Norman, Scotch and Irish. Among them\r\nare elegant forms, rings, bracelets, girdles, tiaras, brooches, &c. They\r\nare in appearance as rich and bright as if made yesterday; and evince\r\nthat in ages long past, both the value of gold and the manner of working\r\nit were well understood. Some of these things were found in graves, some\r\nin morasses, and, probably, some on battle-fields.\r\n\r\n“Here, also, we saw the colossal monuments of stone, disinterred by the\r\nlabors of Mr. Layard, and brought from ancient Nineveh. The bull and the\r\nlion, each with the wings of an eagle, and the face of a man, symbolical\r\nof strength, courage, speed and intelligence, are at present in the\r\nlower room, along with the two gigantic figures in human form, each\r\nbeing originally divided transversely above the waist. It is now\r\nintended to reunite them, when the Nineveh figures receive their final\r\nposition in the museum. These stupendous pieces of primeval sculpture\r\nfill the observer with astonishment, both that they could ever have been\r\nconstructed, and that they should ever have been extricated from their\r\nlong-forgotten sepulchers, and transported, without the slightest\r\ninjury, from a position far inland, across wide oceans, to this distant\r\ncountry, which did not begin to emerge from barbarism until ages after\r\nthe very site of Nineveh had passed into oblivion. These colossal forms\r\nare so vast in their dimensions, that man, by the side of them, appears\r\na pigmy; and still they were shaped by human hands, which for thousands\r\nof years have crumbled into dust, while their works remain fresh and\r\nperfect as when first finished by the chisel of the now long-forgotten\r\nartist. Our polite conductor also accompanied us to a lower room, in\r\nwhich are stored a great number of the alabaster panels of Nineveh. They\r\nare very large, and are covered by figures in relief, bold and perfect;\r\nscenes of war and of peace, figures of master and servant, of monarch\r\nand subject, of warrior and soldier, and of victor and prisoner. In\r\nfact, they are exactly such figures as are represented in the published\r\nvolumes of Mr. Layard, the illustrations in which are in no degree\r\nexaggerated, but, on the contrary, the figures are copied with the most\r\nscrupulous exactness. A hall is in preparation for these precious relics\r\nof an age coeval with the dawn of art and civilization, and of which, as\r\nextended to our time, the entire Christian era forms but an integral\r\npart. At first view, it appears very surprising that they have escaped\r\nthrough thirty or forty centuries without injury; and this is the more\r\nremarkable, as they are composed of so soft a material as alabaster. It\r\nwould certainly have been worn and corroded by the hand of time had it\r\nnot been protected by the mildness of the climate, and still more by the\r\nposition of these sculptures, cut off from the atmosphere, and buried in\r\nthe crumbled and dry earth of the buildings when they were destroyed.”\r\n\r\nThe collection of minerals, &c., Silliman goes on to say, is arranged in\r\nsixty cases in four rooms. And here is the fossil woman of Gaudaloupe, a\r\nskeleton both headless and footless, but having ribs, spine, limbs, &c.,\r\nso complete as to show beyond doubt that once it belonged to a living\r\nwoman; and with it there were found numerous other human bodies as well\r\nas utensils, rude weapons, &c. Here, too, are the remains of the\r\nenormous lizards of geological antiquity. “The _fossil saurians_, in the\r\ncollection of Mr. Hawkins,” says the writer just quoted, “purchased by\r\nthe museum, were skeletons of ichthyosauri, plesiosauri, and other forms\r\nof reptilian life. There is a perfect fossil skeleton of the\r\nichthyosaurus, which I measured. It is fully twenty feet long; and there\r\nis beneath it a series of vertebræ of another individual, doubly\r\ncup-shaped, like the vertebræ of fishes. They seem to be all present,\r\nand must have belonged to an animal still larger than the one which I\r\nhave named. The figures of these ancient distinct races are now familiar\r\nin our elementary books, and I shall not enter into any minute details.\r\nMost of the fossil saurians were marine. They appeared soon after the\r\nperiod of the coal formation, and were continued to that of the chalk. A\r\nminiature lizard has been recently found in the old-red-sandstone.\r\n\r\n“The collection in the British museum is appalling. It fills one with\r\nastonishment, as we here contemplate the indubitable remains of an age\r\ngone by, never to return. Still more astonishing are the reptilian\r\nremains, brought to light chiefly by the researches of Dr. Mantell,\r\naided by Dr. Buckland and other coadjutors. But to Dr. Mantell solely\r\nbelongs the credit of having established the existence of several\r\nfamilies of land lizards, whose magnitude far exceeds that of the marine\r\nsaurians. The bones of the iguanodon, of the hylæosaurus, and\r\npelorosaurus, are colossal—equal to those of the largest elephants, and\r\nin some individuals even surpassing them, while their length, in some\r\ninstances, was equal to that of the longest whales. The form of their\r\nteeth, and the hollow condition of their bones, with a large canal for\r\nmarrow, prove that their habits were those of terrestrial animals; while\r\nthe form of the teeth, and the solid condition of the bones of the\r\nsaurians, before named, adapt them to a marine life; since the buoyancy\r\nderived from the sustaining power of the water would enable them to swim\r\nwith this additional weight. The bones of these land lizards discovered\r\nby Dr. Mantell, and now in the museum, with those in his own house,\r\nstudied and disposed of anatomically, by his skill in comparative\r\nanatomy, and in the general principles of physiology, prove the\r\nexistence of these giants of antiquity, which were not carnivorous, but\r\nwere vegetable eaters, in a climate capable of producing a tropical\r\nvegetation, which then existed both in England and on the European\r\ncontinent, and probably pervaded, more or less, the entire planet. Dr.\r\nMantell’s original memoirs and published volumes must be consulted for\r\nthe proofs of these positions, and for the details of anatomical\r\nstructure. He was with me in my last visit to the museum, and gave\r\nadditional explanations on the grand fossils deposited there, especially\r\nthose of his own gathering, and also on those obtained by Mr. Hawkins,\r\nof Gloucester. Both collections relate chiefly to the extinct colossal\r\nlizards of the gone-by geological ages. The immense collection of\r\nfossils from the Himalaya mountains also passed under review. They have\r\nadded much to our knowledge of zoölogical antiquity. Dr. Buckland\r\ndiscovered near Oxford the bones of a large carnivorous reptile, the\r\nmegalosaurus, which approximated toward the magnitude of the lizards of\r\nDr. Mantell.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                        MADAME TUSSEAU’S MUSEUM.\r\n\r\nThis museum consists of a celebrated collection of wax figures, which\r\n“enjoys a high and deserved reputation,” says Silliman; and which, he\r\nadds, “is the only one of the kind from which I have ever received any\r\npleasure.” “There are three successive rooms,” he continues, “in which\r\nare seen a great number of personages in costume, and in natural and\r\ncharacteristic positions in relation to each other. In the vestibule the\r\nvisitor passes through groups of marble statues, such as may be seen in\r\nmany other places. On entering the first room of the museum, exactly at\r\nthe door, and sitting in a chair, a pleasant looking young Chinese, a\r\ndoor-keeper, as I supposed, almost spoke to me, and I did quite speak to\r\nhim, so lifelike was he; but as he seemed not to understand English, we\r\npassed on. The next personage, in the right corner of the room, was a\r\nwell dressed gentleman, whom I for the moment mistook for a living\r\nEnglishman; he looked so very affable, that I took him for an official,\r\nand was about to make an inquiry of him, when I perceived that he too\r\nbelonged to the deaf mutes. Next came those to whom I must not speak,\r\nthe queen with Prince Albert, and four of their sweet children, mounted\r\non an elevated platform. The likenesses are so striking, judging from\r\npictures, statues and information, (for I have not seen them,) that the\r\nroyal personages might be readily recognized by one who knew them; for,\r\nas seen here, they are all but speaking, and moving, and breathing.\r\n\r\n“Although no figures in these rooms spoke, three gave signs of life.\r\nOne, a Chinese lady in a rich oriental dress, was standing on her little\r\nfeet, by her husband, while he, a Hong merchant, in splendid attire, was\r\nlistening to some communication from her; and although we could not hear\r\nwhat she said, she gave effect to her address by an earnest look and by\r\na gentle movement of her head. Another lady, Madame —--, afterward a\r\nvictim of Robespierre’s cruelty, because she indignantly refused to\r\nbecome the victim of his lust, lies asleep on her couch in her day\r\ndress, probably in prison prior to her execution. She breathes, and her\r\nbust, with her dress, rises and falls so naturally with the respiration,\r\nthat you instinctively move softly, lest she should be disturbed in her\r\nslumber. In these rooms are seen imposing occasions of state. The queen,\r\nin another scene than which has been named, with her family, is\r\nsurrounded by her ministers, bishops, and lords and ladies, and by\r\ncourtiers, and generals, and foreign embassadors; (I blend two of these\r\nscenes into one;) all are in full court-dress, in magnificent robes, and\r\nsparkling with factitious diamonds. The illusion is so complete, that\r\nwere an observer introduced suddenly into the scene, without an\r\nintimation of the deception, he would be startled at finding himself in\r\nsuch company.\r\n\r\n“Hundreds of the most eminent persons, both of the living and the dead,\r\nare here, and the likenesses are so good that I readily recognized\r\nseveral, either of those whom I had seen when living, (_e. g._, George\r\nIII., Pitt, and Fox,) or whose pictures or busts were familiar,\r\n(Voltaire, Sir. W. Scott, and Washington.) Calvin, Luther and John Knox\r\nare in one group, and the latter is addressing Queen Mary of Scotland,\r\non whom he seems not likely to make any more impression now than he did\r\nof yore. I might multiply these instances. Napoleon and his marshals;\r\nLouis XVI. and his children and sister; Louis Philippe and his family;\r\nQueen Elizabeth and her courtiers; Anne Boleyn and her bloody husband;\r\nCharles I. and II., the former listening to a talk from Cromwell; James\r\nI. and II.; the royal dukes, sons of George III.; Lord Wellington; Lord\r\nJohn Russell; Admiral Napier, of Acre memory; and many, many more.\r\nPictures of eminent persons and of interesting scenes are hung all\r\naround the lofty rooms, which are gilded and adorned in the manner of a\r\npalace. A throng of visitors were in the apartments, but from their\r\ndress and appearance, it was obvious that they belonged not to the upper\r\nten thousand, but to the lower million, and most of them were probably\r\nof that class, who, having been drawn to London by the great exhibition,\r\ntake the opportunity to see other wonders of the great metropolis, and\r\nwe were pleased that they could be thus gratified.\r\n\r\n“Passing the room of _horrors_, (that is of murders and executions,)\r\nwhere an additional sixpence is demanded for the pleasure of seeing what\r\nall should desire to avoid, we entered a room called the hall of\r\nNapoleon, occupied chiefly by relics of that great captain and emperor,\r\nwho made such an impression on the age in which he lived, that his name\r\nand his deeds—the deeds of more than twenty years of sanguinary\r\nconflict, with only short interludes of repose—are now enrolled in\r\nhistory, and will go down to the end of time. The relics here preserved\r\nare personal articles, which once belonged to him. His own hair is\r\ninclosed in the same locket with that of his son, the Duke of\r\nReichstadt. There is the sword of the Egyptian campaign, which was waved\r\nin many a bloody battle. Here are the more harmless utensils of his\r\ntable; but the most conspicuous things are his carriages, three in\r\nnumber. In one of these he made his excursions from Longwood, in St.\r\nHelena, to the boundaries of that small island, rough with volcanic\r\nrocks. This carriage is a plain yellow barouche, with nothing peculiar\r\nin its appearance. His common or usual traveling carriage was in the\r\npost-chaise form, with inside seats for only two persons, and there is a\r\nlow division between them. His iron bedstead was folded like the legs of\r\na grasshopper, packed in a case, and hung beneath the coachman’s seat.\r\nInside of the carriage is a writing-desk, which can be drawn out at\r\npleasure, to accommodate the traveler; and it still retained its\r\nconnection with the front of the carriage. There is a movable board,\r\nwhich answered for a table; and a door opens in front, beneath the\r\nwriting-desk, to afford room for the limbs when the traveler wishes to\r\nsleep. The bedstead might perhaps admit of a partial contraction, so as\r\nto be placed in the carriage, in front of the seat, as a support, or\r\nthere might have been some other contrivance for this purpose. This\r\ncarriage is said to be lined with concealed iron plates, to afford\r\nprotection against the bullets of assassins. That found on the field of\r\nWaterloo is yellow, and the paint and varnish, have come off in certain\r\nplaces, so that it is defaced in appearance. This latter carriage is a\r\ncommon coach with two seats, the front seat, as usual, reversed; but\r\nthere is nothing peculiar in its appearance or conveniences, and it was\r\nprobably taken in haste after the return from Elba; for the hundred days\r\nincluded Napoleon’s hegira, his brief sway in Paris, and his downfall at\r\nWaterloo, and to that fatal field he rode in this carriage. But the most\r\ninteresting relic is the bed on which the fallen emperor died. We were\r\nassured that it was the very bed and bedstead of St. Helena, and that it\r\nwas the camp establishment of his campaigns.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                        THE PALACE OF BLENHEIM.\r\n\r\nThe palace of the famous Duke of Marlborough, presented to him by the\r\nnation, in honor of his services, is not far from Oxford, in England.\r\nThis magnificent structure has often been described, and recently by\r\nSilliman in his “Visit to Europe.” “We entered,” he says, “by the\r\nsplendid portal erected to the memory of her husband by the surviving\r\nDuchess of Marlborough. The palace is situated on a plain in the midst\r\nof an extensive domain, eleven miles in circuit, laid out in the finest\r\nstyle of an English park. There are twenty-five hundred acres covered\r\nwith the richest verdure, including a beautiful lake, from which large\r\npike are obtained. The palace is an immense structure, and has been\r\ngreatly improved by the present duke, who, it is said, has recently\r\nexpended eighty thousand pounds upon the establishment. It is in vain to\r\nattempt a detailed description. The north front measures three hundred\r\nand eighty-four feet from one wing to the other. We were courteously\r\nconducted through the palace by a man of good appearance, and of civil\r\nbut formal manners. He was dressed in black: you would take him for a\r\ngentleman, and feel that it would be improper to offer him money, but he\r\ntook it from our party. We were taken through one splendid room after\r\nanother, until it would seem as if there would be no end of them. They\r\nwere generally lofty, apparently twenty to twenty-five feet high, and\r\nornamented with rich ceilings, gilding, and fresco paintings. The\r\nprincipal apartments are the hall, the bow-window room, the state\r\nbedroom, the billiard-room, the breakfast-room, the grand cabinet, the\r\nsmall drawing-room, the great drawing-room, the dining-room, the saloon,\r\nthe green drawing-room, the state drawing-room, the crimson\r\ndrawing-room, the library, the chapel, and the Titian room. This palace\r\nhad no appearance of being the comfortable home of the family, who, it\r\nis said, keep it up out of regard to the glory of their great ancestor;\r\nbut that they are too poor to live in it in a style of appropriate\r\nmagnificence. The gardens or pleasure grounds, and the private grounds,\r\nwere not visible.\r\n\r\n“The pictures in this palace are numerous, and many of them are\r\nadmirable. Vandyke, Sir Godfrey Kneller, Rubens, Holbein, Paul Veronese,\r\nLeonardi da Vinci, Reynolds, Poussin, Carlo Dolci, Corregio, Rembrandt,\r\nTeniers, Titian, and other eminent artists, by mental creations,\r\ncontributed the living glowing images of their own minds, or transferred\r\nliving features to the canvas. Many very beautiful and lovely women and\r\nprincely men look down upon the observer from these animated and\r\neloquent walls; for the palace is, in fact, an immense gallery of\r\npictures, divided among many rooms. The victories of the Duke of\r\nMarlborough are displayed in Antwerp tapestry upon the walls of several\r\nof the apartments. The tapestry pictures are of great size: a single\r\npicture covers a side, sometimes two sides of a large room; so that\r\nthere is space to exhibit also the scenery of the country; there is room\r\nalso for portraits of the principal officers, as large as life—of the\r\nduke himself, and even of the horses; and near or remote, the hostile\r\narmies are lingering on the fearful edge of battle, or they are actually\r\nengaged in deadly combat. How touching the reflection, how sad the\r\nremembrance, that, excepting the present duke and his family, only one\r\nindividual of all the vast number of human beings represented by these\r\npictures survives. One that appears as a little child in a large family\r\ngroup, is now the aged grandmother of a distinguished peer. All the rest\r\nhave passed away, and the great Marlborough himself, and his proud,\r\naspiring duchess, lie under the marble pavement of the chapel in the\r\npalace, as Louis XIV., the Grand, reposes in his own tomb, and Queen\r\nAnne in hers; and all the sanguinary conflicts of that eventful period\r\nare now to be found in history alone. War, by a spirit of chivalry, was\r\nthen a kind of duel on a great scale; it is said that military courtesy\r\nsometimes offered the first fire to the enemy; and a similar offer being\r\nmade in return, they thus bandied compliments as if in sport, when they\r\nknew that the first fire would lay many a gallant soldier low.\r\n\r\n“One room is one hundred and eighty-three feet in length, and contains\r\nthe ducal library, consisting of seventeen thousand volumes. They are\r\nprotected by a wire netting in front. At the upper end of the library is\r\na fine marble statue of Queen Anne, which cost five thousand guineas.\r\nThis palace, like most of the ancient public structures in England\r\nconstructed of oölite, is externally much corroded by time. These\r\nimmense establishments are, of course, very expensive in repairs, in\r\nembellishments, in service, and in many other ways; but they bring no\r\nincome; nor, in general, does the vast domain which surrounds the\r\npalace. If kept in high order, as they generally are, they require a\r\ngreat number of laborers, especially in the horticultural department;\r\nand for all this there is little or no return, unless it may be\r\nsomething toward supplies of food for the household. There is at\r\nBlenheim a column or obelisk to the memory of the Duke of Marlborough,\r\nwhich is one hundred and thirty-four feet high, crowned with a statue in\r\nRoman dress. The gallery of Titian is secluded in a separate building,\r\nand for reasons obvious to those who have seen it, is exhibited in a\r\nmore reserved manner to artists and amateurs.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                       THE PALACE OF VERSAILLES.\r\n\r\nThis splendid palace was founded by Louis XIV. “A building on this\r\nground,” says a late tourist, “had been used by his immediate\r\npredecessors as a hunting-lodge; but in 1660, Louis commenced converting\r\nit into a palace, and, after many additions, it became the royal\r\nresidence in 1681. For a century or more it was a favorite abode of the\r\nkings of France, and no expense was spared upon its decorations. In\r\n1792, the palace was devastated by the revolutionists. Everything\r\nconvertible into money was sold for the nation, and but for Napoleon, it\r\nwould have been completely destroyed. It was said, that he would have\r\nmade it his residence, had it not required fifty millions of francs to\r\nput it in order. Louis XIV. expended upon it forty millions of pounds\r\nsterling, and Louis Philippe fifteen millions of francs. The latter\r\nrestored it to splendor, and labored to concentrate in it splendid\r\nillustrations of the glories of France. All the painted ceilings,\r\ngildings, &c., were restored, and new galleries and saloons were formed.\r\nAn immense series of paintings, sculptures, and works of art,\r\nillustrative of every important event that has reflected honor on the\r\nannals of France, now fills the splendid halls of this noble palace,\r\nforming a historical museum that has not its parallel in Europe, or in\r\nthe world. It would be a vain attempt to endeavor to describe the\r\npalace. Its buildings and grounds are of very great extent. It is said\r\nto contain one hundred and thirty-seven grand saloons and lesser\r\napartments, which are furnished with ten thousand pictures.\r\n\r\n“Four hours are allowed for the inspection of the rooms and of their\r\ncontents: and this time we employed most industriously, passing through\r\nthe apartments with painful rapidity. No sooner were we attracted by a\r\nroom, or interested in a picture, than we were hurried on to another,\r\nand another, and another apartment, until our faculties were tired, and\r\nour eyes satiated with the brilliant display. Many of the pictures are\r\nvery large; and it appeared, from the delineations on some of the larger\r\nones, which were in an unfinished state, that the canvas was hanging on\r\nthe wall where the pictures now are when they were painted. Most of the\r\npictures are battle scenes, from Clovis, Charlemagne, and the crusaders,\r\ndown to Napoleon’s wonderful career, and even to the war in Algeria. The\r\nfigures are of such dimensions as generally to appear of the size of\r\nlife, notwithstanding the distance and elevation from which they are\r\nseen. It is painful to observe how large a part of human effort has been\r\nexpended upon war. There are, however, many pictures of quiet scenes,\r\nand an immense number of portraits. Although the productions of the\r\nFrench pencil are here of unequal excellence, there are certainly among\r\nthem no small number of fine pictures. Here also we see a vast\r\ncollection of statues in marble and of casts in plaster, and a great\r\nseries of medals and coins. The pictures of royal residences represent\r\nmany that no longer exist, and with them are illustrations of the\r\ncostumes of past times. Some of the galleries in the palace are three\r\nhundred feet long, and are filled with statuary. In order to see all the\r\nworks of art, it is necessary to walk three or four miles.\r\n\r\n“We looked into the private theater and chapel. Prayers and divine\r\nservice were held in the one, and plays acted for the royal\r\nentertainment in the other; and here members of the royal family\r\nsometimes appeared on the stage. The confessional of Louis XIV. is a\r\nsmall room, by the side of which is a window, where a soldier was always\r\nstationed while the king was at confession; and the very chair in which\r\nhis confessor, Père la Chaise, sat, and the very cushion on which Louis\r\nXIV. kneeled, are here in their places. Strange infatuation! The\r\nconfessor who urged and obtained the revocation of the edict of Nantes,\r\nwhich was to let loose the dogs of persecution upon the Protestants, and\r\nthe pliable monarch who yielded himself to license this cruel work of\r\ndeath on thousands, and of banishment upon many thousands more, could\r\nhere meet in a private act of devotion, while they were about to violate\r\nthe first laws of humanity! The bed in which the king slept, and in\r\nwhich he died, is still to be seen in his bedroom, and no one has since\r\nslept in that room. The private room of Marie Antoinette, queen of Louis\r\nXVI., has a small door in the side, through which the queen escaped in\r\nOctober, 1789, when the palace was forced. Through this door she was\r\ncompelled to fly in her night dress, while a faithful officer of her\r\nguard was killed on the spot. All these melancholy places we saw, and\r\nalso the gallery in which the king and queen and their children\r\nappeared, October sixth, 1789, to appease the fury of the Parisian mob,\r\nmany thousands of whom filled the immense court of the palace yard. In\r\nthis gallery La Fayette also appeared with them, and in sight of the\r\npeople kissed the queen’s hand, to testify his loyalty and fidelity. It\r\nrequired no small share of courage and firmness thus to appear as the\r\nfriend and protector of the royal pair, and their children, in the face\r\nof an infuriated multitude. This palace is associated with many other\r\ninteresting events. In the time of Louis XIV. it was the scene of more\r\nsplendor than any palace in Europe. And though for a time neglected\r\nafter the flight of Louis Philippe, yet more recently under the\r\ngovernment of Louis Napoleon, it has been adorned and restored in a very\r\nlavish and expensive manner. I had no opportunity to see the splendid\r\nplay of the waters: the fountains were undergoing repair; besides, they\r\nplay only on Sundays, which is the great gala day of the French, and\r\nwhen vast numbers of people, as in past times, resort to Versailles for\r\namusement. In the time of Louis XIV., XV., and XVI., there were here\r\nextensive military establishments, which are now in decay. There was a\r\nmanufactory of arms, which produced annually fifty thousand stands; but\r\nit was plundered by the Prussians, when the allies took Paris in 1814.\r\nThe court of the palace measures eight hundred feet by five hundred, and\r\nis paved, as the courts of the French palaces generally are. In this\r\ncourt there are statues of great men, Colbert, Turenne, and others, of\r\nultra-colossal size. In the center of the court there is an equestrian\r\nstatue of Louis XIV., also of enormous dimensions. Versailles, nourished\r\nby the power, influence and money of Louis XIV., became a splendid city\r\nof one hundred thousand people; but the population has now dwindled to\r\nthirty thousand. Louis XVI. was an excellent mechanic: happy had it been\r\nfor him had a shop instead of a throne been his lot. We saw a good\r\ndoor-lock of his construction, which was still serviceable; and there is\r\nyet to be seen a brass meridian made by him, and inlaid in the floor.\r\nSeveral of the royal carriages are here in a perfect state of\r\npreservation. They are gorgeous in the extreme, being all covered\r\nmassively with gilded carving, and superbly lined.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                        THE PALACE OF ST. CLOUD.\r\n\r\n“This splendid palace is close upon the Seine, at a point where that\r\nriver takes a graceful curve, and, in the course of several miles, is\r\ncrossed by numerous bridges of stone, elegantly arched, and of the most\r\nsolid construction. The landscape is here very rich and picturesque.\r\nBarracks of superior construction, and other handsome buildings, rise on\r\nthe slope of a hill from the river, and the palace crowns the summit.\r\nThe palace of St. Cloud was founded in 1572, by a rich financier. In\r\n1658, it was purchased by Louis XIV. for his brother, the Duke of\r\nOrleans, who adorned it expensively. In 1782, Louis XVI. bought it for\r\nhis queen, Marie Antoinette. It was a favorite place with her, as it was\r\nsubsequently with Napoleon and Josephine. The principal front is one\r\nhundred and forty feet long and seventy feet high. Important events have\r\nhappened here. In this palace Henry III. was assassinated by Jacques\r\nClement, in 1589, and our guide assured us, that a place in the long\r\nroom, which he indicated, was the very spot where the deed was done.\r\nHenrietta, the queen of Charles I. of England, died here. Here Napoleon,\r\nNovember tenth, 1799, completed the subjugation of the then existing\r\ngovernment, dispersed the members of the council of ancients, whom he\r\nhad adjourned to this place from Paris, and assumed the reins himself.\r\nIn this place, the capitulation of Paris was signed in 1815. Here\r\nCharles X., in 1830, was informed of the explosion of the revolution;\r\nand here Louis Philippe rested a short time, during his flight from\r\nParis in 1848.\r\n\r\n“We have seen nothing in Europe so delightful as this palace. Its\r\nsituation is splendid; being elevated high upon the side of a hill\r\nrising from the Seine, it overlooks Paris, and all the populous and most\r\nbeautiful country around; the Seine winds gracefully along through the\r\nmeadows, and appears wider than at Paris, where it is narrowed by the\r\nquays and other structures of the city. The views into the park are very\r\nfine on all sides of the palace; in the interior the ground rises, and\r\nvistas open up the green slope, with a long avenue of statues standing\r\nin the open air in one direction, and a tower in the distance in\r\nanother, while a noble park of old and lofty forest trees, stretches\r\nover the flat ground in front, quite to the river. In the interior of\r\nthe palace, everything is in the best taste. The furniture of the rooms\r\nremains as it was left by Josephine, Maria Louisa, and the family of\r\nLouis Philippe. The Duchess of Orleans, daughter-in-law of the late\r\nking, passed much time here with her children, and their beds, as well\r\nas that of Louis Philippe and his queen, remain undisturbed, with their\r\nrich silk curtains and covers.\r\n\r\n“The pictures at St. Cloud are very numerous, and are lovely exhibitions\r\nof that almost creative art. They are all drawn from quiet scenes, such\r\nas must ever remain grateful to the human mind. Among the hundreds of\r\npictures by the first masters that adorn these walls, there is not a\r\nsingle battle-piece. In this respect, St. Cloud presents a striking and\r\nvery agreeable contrast with the carnage that crimsons the long\r\ngalleries of Versailles. Louis Philippe sought, in that palace, to\r\ngratify the national avidity for glory, by multiplying battle-scenes in\r\nwhich the arms of France had been triumphant, and by depicting the\r\npersons of her heroes, until the tired eye that gazes on them is\r\nsatiated with gorgeous costume, and the mind afflicted with human\r\nsuffering. At St. Cloud a more amiable feeling was cherished, as appears\r\nby the charming pictures of rural scenery, of mild and splendid\r\nlandscapes, of peaceful buildings, abodes of happy domestic life, scenes\r\nliving and real, and ever grateful. As the private rooms in which the\r\nsuccessive royal families lived, are rich in elegant simplicity, in a\r\nstyle of chaste beauty, they are in strong contrast with the rooms of\r\nstate, which are extremely magnificent, and adorned by a profusion of\r\nprincely decorations. Their domes are all alive with the imaginary\r\nbeings of fabulous antiquity. Gods and goddesses, and muses and nymphs,\r\nand a multitude of creations of poetic fancy and records of old legends,\r\ndecorate the ceilings. A principal ornament of the public rooms is the\r\nGobelin tapestry, manufactured and hung by order of Louis Philippe. All\r\nthat I had seen before at Windsor castle, or at Blenheim palace, fades\r\nin comparison with the rich decorations of the Gobelin looms, which\r\nadorn the public halls of St. Cloud. These textile pictures are\r\nperfectly beautiful, and from their magnitude and the august personages\r\nof the historical dramas which they present so impressively to the eye,\r\nthey are sublime. No one viewing them from the distance across the room,\r\nwould even suspect that they are anything else than the most perfect\r\nproductions of the pencil, and even when the observer approaches them,\r\nit is not easy to convince himself that the splendid illusion is\r\nproduced by the interweaving of colored woolen and silken threads. Five\r\nof the scenes here depicted in Gobelin tapestry are copied from original\r\npaintings still existing in the Louvre, executed by Rubens, for Marie de\r\nMedicis. The first is the duke of Anjou, declared king of Spain (Philip\r\nV.) The second of these pictures, which is not less than twenty-five\r\nfeet square, is the birth of Marie de Medicis; the third is the\r\npresentation of her picture to Henry V.; the fourth, his marriage with\r\nher; the fifth represents his departure from his capital, and the\r\ncommitting of the government to the care of the queen. We saw also most\r\nmagnificent vases of Sèvres porcelain: one of them was presented to\r\nMaria Antoinette; it must have been, I believe, five feet high without\r\nthe pedestal, and of the capacity of a barrel or two. We have nothing in\r\nAmerica that can convey a full impression of these superb productions of\r\nthe plastic art. They are modeled after the forms of the most beautiful\r\nEtruscan vases; the most perfect purity of the porcelain material is\r\ncontrasted with the finest efforts of the pencil, in the pictures, which\r\nbeing incorporated by the fire, are indissolubly wedded to the basis on\r\nwhich they are delineated, and they are resplendent with gold and blue\r\nenamel of cobalt. One is at a loss which most to admire, the productions\r\nof the Gobelin looms or those of the Sèvres furnaces.\r\n\r\n“The floors of the palace, according to the general custom in French\r\nhouses, are made of pieces of boards. They rarely exceed six inches in\r\nwidth, and are tastefully disposed in various geometrical figures. All\r\nthe floors that we have seen in Paris, except some that are covered by\r\ncarpets, are kept waxed; the waxing is renewed daily, and they are so\r\nsmooth as to appear hazardous to those unaccustomed to walk upon them.\r\nThe floors of the palace of St. Cloud have been, heretofore, covered by\r\nGobelin carpets, which, at the time of our visit, were rolled and put\r\naway for safe keeping. We saw the council table of Napoleon and Louis\r\nPhilippe, memorable for the deliberations which have been held over its\r\nboards. St. Cloud was the favorite place of consultation on matters of\r\npeace and war; here Napoleon planned some of his campaigns; here Louis\r\nPhilippe passed much time with his family, and his daughter-in-law, the\r\nDuchess of Orleans, found a quiet retreat with her little son, the Count\r\nde Paris, whom she in person presented in the legislative hall during\r\nthe revolution of 1848. Her husband, the Duke of Orleans, presumptive\r\nheir to the throne, having been killed by a mysterious providence, she\r\nnaturally hoped that the legislature would acknowledge the claims of her\r\nson, founded on both those of his father and his grandfather Louis\r\nPhilippe; but all the world knows that she was disappointed, and was\r\nfain to retreat and seek protection for her child and herself. There was\r\na deep feeling of pensiveness connected with our visit to St. Cloud;\r\nclosed now as it is and quite solitary, without a single individual\r\nremaining of those who formerly figured there; it was to us an\r\ninstructive memento of the vanity of human glory. The splendid\r\napartments remain, with all their furniture and decorations in perfect\r\norder. The solitary chapel, chastely elegant, although grave in its\r\narchitecture, seemed all ready and waiting for the arrival of\r\nworshipers; and the entire palace, with its beautiful grounds, impresses\r\none almost with the belief, that kings and queens, and courtiers and\r\nnobles, and guests of renown, will soon return and give life and joy to\r\nthose vacant scenes; but alas, except some few members of the family of\r\nLouis Philippe and of Napoleon, all are gone to the tomb. The dreaded\r\nconqueror of nations found his second prison and his grave on a bleak\r\nrock, in the ocean, and his final tomb among those invalids whom, in\r\ntheir youth, he led to fields of battle and victory. Josephine, once an\r\nornament of St. Cloud, as she was of every scene in which she presided,\r\nwent with a broken heart from Malmaison to her grave. An old man, our\r\nguide through the palace, said to us, ‘I have been thirty years here,\r\nand I have seen three monarchs expelled from this palace and from their\r\nthrones.’ I have omitted to mention the large library of Louis Philippe,\r\nwhich still remains at St. Cloud, undisturbed and in perfect order. It\r\nis my impression that the number of volumes was stated at twelve\r\nthousand.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                    THE CRYSTAL PALACE IN NEW YORK.\r\n\r\nTurning now from palaces constructed for the kings and monarchs of the\r\nearth, let us pass to palaces reared for the exhibition of the works of\r\nindustry and art of the people. And the first of these which we will\r\nnotice is the crystal palace in New York. This splendid structure, a\r\nview of which is given in the cut below, was erected for the exhibition\r\nof the industry and art of all nations. This magnificent building was\r\nerected on Reservoir square, at the northern extremity of the city of\r\nNew York, from plans furnished by Messrs. Carstensen and Gildermeister.\r\nThe building is now standing, and is filled with the works of industry\r\nand art from every part of the globe. Its main features are as follows.\r\nIt is, with the exception of the floor, entirely constructed of iron and\r\nglass. The general idea of the edifice is that of a Greek cross,\r\nsurmounted by a dome at the intersection. Each diameter of the cross is\r\nthree hundred and sixty-five feet and five inches long. There are three\r\nentrances, each forty-seven feet wide, and one of which is approached by\r\na flight of eight steps. Over each front is a large semicircular\r\nfan-light, forty-one feet wide and twenty-one feet high, answering to\r\nthe arch of the nave. Each arm of the cross is on the ground-plan one\r\nhundred and forty-nine feet broad. This is divided into a central nave\r\nand two aisles, one on each side; the nave forty-one, each aisle\r\nfifty-four feet wide. The central portion or nave is carried up to the\r\nhight of sixty-seven feet, and the semicircular arch by which it is\r\nspanned, is forty-one feet broad. There are thus in effect two arched\r\nnaves crossing each other at right angles, forty-one feet broad,\r\nsixty-seven feet high to the crown of the arch, and three hundred and\r\nsixty-five feet long; and on each side of these naves is an aisle\r\nfifty-four feet broad and forty-five feet high. The exterior of the\r\nridgeway of the nave is seventy-one feet. Each aisle is covered by a\r\ngallery of its own width, and twenty-four feet from the floor. The\r\ncentral dome is one hundred feet in diameter, sixty-eight feet inside\r\nfrom the floor to the spring of the arch, and one hundred and eighteen\r\nfeet to the crown; and on the outside, with the lantern, one hundred and\r\nforty-nine feet. The exterior angles of the building are ingeniously\r\nfilled up with a triangular lean-to, twenty-four feet high, which gives\r\nthe ground-plan an octagonal shape, each side or face being one hundred\r\nand forty-nine feet wide. At each angle is an octagonal tower eight feet\r\nin diameter, and seventy-five feet high.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CRYSTAL PALACE IN NEW YORK.]\r\n\r\nTen large and eight winding staircases connect the principal floor with\r\nthe gallery, which opens on the three balconies that are situated over\r\nthe entrance hall, and afford ample space for flower decorations,\r\nstatues, vases, &c. The ten principal staircases consist of two flights\r\nof steps with two landing-places to each; the eight winding staircases\r\nare placed in the octagonal towers, which lead also to small balconies\r\non the tops of the towers and to the roof of the building.\r\n\r\nThe building contains on the ground-floor, one hundred and eleven\r\nthousand square feet of space, and in its galleries, which are\r\nfifty-four feet wide, sixty-two thousand square feet more, making a\r\ntotal area of one hundred and seventy-three thousand square feet, for\r\nthe purposes of exhibition. There are thus on the ground-floor two acres\r\nand a half, or exactly two and fifty-two hundredths; in the galleries,\r\none acre and forty-four hundredths; total, within an inconsiderable\r\nfraction, four acres.\r\n\r\nThere are on the ground-floor one hundred and ninety octagonal cast-iron\r\ncolumns, twenty-one feet above the floor, and eight inches in diameter,\r\ncast hollow, of different thicknesses, from half an inch to one inch.\r\nThese columns receive the cast-iron girders. These are twenty-six and\r\none-third feet long and three feet high, and serve to sustain the\r\ngalleries and the wrought-iron construction of the roof, as well as to\r\nbrace the whole structure in every direction. The girders, as well as\r\nthe second-story columns, are fastened to the columns in the first\r\nstory, by connecting pieces of the same octagonal shape as the columns,\r\nthree feet and four inches high, having proper flanges and lugs to\r\nfasten all pieces together by bolts. The number of lower-floor girders\r\nis two hundred and fifty-two, besides twelve wrought-iron girders of the\r\nsame hight, and forty-one feet span over a part of the nave. The second\r\nstory contains one hundred and forty-eight columns, of the same shape as\r\nthose below, and seventeen feet and seven inches high. These receive\r\nanother tier of girders, numbering one hundred and sixty, for the\r\nsupport of the roofs of the aisles, each nave being covered by sixteen\r\ncast-iron semicircular arches, each composed of four pieces.\r\n\r\nThe dome will strike every one as the grand architectural feature of the\r\nbuilding. Its diameter is one hundred feet, and its hight to the\r\nspringing line is nearly seventy feet, and to the crown of the arch, one\r\nhundred and twenty-three feet. It is said to be the largest, as well as\r\nalmost the only dome hitherto erected in the United States. It is\r\nsupported by twenty-four columns, which rise beyond the second story,\r\nand to a hight of sixty-two feet above the principal floor. The system\r\nof wrought-iron trusses which connects them together at the top, and is\r\nsupported by them, forms two concentric polygons, each of sixteen sides.\r\nThey receive a cast-iron bed-plate, to which the cast-iron shoes for the\r\nribs of the dome are bolted. The latter are thirty-two in number. They\r\nare constructed of two curves of double angle iron, securely connected\r\ntogether by trellis-work. The requisite steadiness is secured by\r\ntie-rods, which brace them both vertically and horizontally. At the top\r\nthe ribs are bolted to a horizontal ring of wrought and cast iron, which\r\nhas a diameter of twenty-feet in the clear, and is surmounted by the\r\nlantern. As in the other roofs of the building, the dome is cased with\r\nmatched deal and tin sheathing. Light is communicated to the interior\r\nthrough the lantern, and also in part from the sides, which are pierced\r\nfor thirty-two ornamental windows. These are glazed with stained glass,\r\nrepresenting the arms of the union and of its several states, and form\r\nno inconsiderable part of the interior decoration.\r\n\r\nThe external walls of the building are constructed of cast-iron framing\r\nand panel-work, into which are inserted the sashes of the windows and\r\nthe louvers for ventilation. The glass is one-eighth of an inch thick,\r\nand was manufactured at the Jackson glass works, New York, and afterward\r\nenameled by Cooper & Belcher, of Camptown, N. J. The enamel, with which\r\nthe whole of it is covered, is laid upon the glass with a brush, and\r\nafter drying, is subjected to the intense heat of a kiln, by which the\r\ncoating is vitrified, and rendered as durable as the glass itself. It\r\nproduces an effect similar to that of ground glass, being translucent,\r\nbut not transparent. The sun’s rays, diffused by passing through it,\r\nyield an agreeable light, and are deprived of that heat and glare which\r\nbelong to them in this climate. In the absence of a similar precaution\r\nin the crystal palace at Hyde park, in England, (of which an account\r\nwill next be given,) the roofs of which, as well as walls, were inclosed\r\nwith transparent glass, it was found necessary to cover the interior of\r\nthe building with canvas, to produce the required shade.\r\n\r\nAt each angle of the building there is an octagonal tower, eight feet in\r\ndiameter and seventy-six feet in hight. These contain winding stairways,\r\nwhich lead to the galleries and roofs, and were intended for the use of\r\nthe officers and employees of the association. Twelve broad staircases,\r\none on either side of each entrance, and four beneath the dome, connect\r\nthe principal floor with the gallery. The latter are circular in part,\r\nand consist of two flights of steps with two landing-places. The\r\nflooring of the galleries is made of closely matched planks, while those\r\nforming the floor of the first story are separated by narrow intervals,\r\nin the same manner and for the same purpose as in the London building.\r\nOver each of the principal entrance halls, the galleries open upon\r\nbalconies, which afford ample space for placing flowers, vases and\r\nstatues for decoration. Above the balconies, the ends of the naves are\r\nadorned with large fan-lights, corresponding to the semicircular arches\r\nwithin. On each side of the entrances there are ticket offices, and\r\nadjacent to them rooms are provided for the officers of the association,\r\ntelegraph, &c.\r\n\r\nThe rapid and unexpected increase of the applications of exhibitors,\r\ninduced the association to erect a large addition to the building\r\nalready described. It consists of two parts, of one and two stories\r\nrespectively, and occupies the entire space between the main building\r\nand the reservoir. Its length is four hundred and fifty-one feet and\r\nfive inches, and its extreme width is seventy-five feet. It is designed\r\nfor the reception of machinery in motion, the cabinets of mining and\r\nmineralogy, and the refreshment rooms, with their necessary offices. The\r\nsecond story, which is nearly four hundred and fifty feet long,\r\ntwenty-one feet wide, and extends the whole length, is entirely devoted\r\nto the exhibition of pictures and statuary. It is lighted from a\r\nskylight, four hundred and nineteen feet long, and eight feet and six\r\ninches wide.\r\n\r\nThe decorations of the building were intrusted to Henry Greenough, Esq.,\r\nbrother of the lamented sculptor of the same name. Mr. Greenough has\r\nmade art his study, and in its pursuit has resided long in Italy. The\r\nleading idea in the plan of decoration, has been to bring out the\r\nbeautiful construction of the building; to decorate construction rather\r\nthan to construct decoration. To do this, and at the same time to\r\npreserve a general harmony of effect, has given Mr. Greenough ample\r\nopportunity to display his knowledge of the resources of his art. The\r\nresult is surprisingly beautiful. The colors employed on the exterior\r\nare mixed in oil, the base being the white lead manufactured by the\r\nBellville Company. The exterior presents the appearance of a building\r\nconstructed of a light-colored bronze, of which all features purely\r\nornamental are of gold. The interior has a prevailing tone of buff, or\r\nrich cream color, which is given to all the cast-iron constructive work.\r\nThis color is relieved by a moderate and judicious use of the three\r\npositive colors, red, blue and yellow, in their several tints of\r\nvermilion, garnet, sky-blue and orange, (certain parts of the ornamental\r\nwork being gilt,) to accord with the arrangement of colors employed in\r\nthe decoration of the ceilings. The only exceptions to the use of oil\r\ncolors are the ceilings of the American lean-to and the dome; these\r\ndecorations are executed on canvas. The effect of the interior of the\r\ndome, (designed by Sr. Monte Lilia,) is particularly splendid. The rays\r\nfrom a golden sun, at the center, descend between the latticed ribs, and\r\narabesques of white and blue, relieved by silver stars, surround the\r\nopenings.\r\n\r\nThe building is supplied with gas and water in every part. The gas was,\r\nat first, designed for the use of the police, in protecting the property\r\nby night; but was so arranged that now, when the building is opened in\r\nthe evenings, it affords the most ample light throughout the entire\r\nedifice. The water is accessible at numerous points, with convenience\r\nfor drinking, also for the attachment of hose, in case of fire.\r\n\r\nThe whole quantity of iron employed in the construction amounts to\r\neighteen hundred tuns; of which three hundred tuns are wrought and\r\nfifteen hundred tuns cast iron. The quantity of glass is fifteen\r\nthousand panes, or fifty-five thousand square feet. The quantity of wood\r\nused amounts to seven hundred and fifty thousand feet, board measure.\r\n\r\nThe general mode of erection by base pieces, columns, connecting pieces\r\nand girders, is the same with that of the great Hyde park building, but\r\nthe construction of the arched nave, and of the dome, is of course\r\nentirely peculiar, and the general effect of the building is completely\r\ndifferent. The London building was certainly deficient in architectural\r\neffect. The form of the New York edifice affords the requisite scope for\r\na pleasing variety of embellishments, by which all monotony can be\r\navoided, and allows a very economical use of the ground. The dome,\r\nindependent of its effect in the interior arrangement of the edifice,\r\nwill give hight and majesty to the exterior.\r\n\r\nTo complete the explanation of the construction of the building, we\r\nrecapitulate its principal dimensions.\r\n\r\n                                                            Ft.  In.\r\n    From principal floor to gallery floor,                   24\r\n    From principal floor to top of second tier of girders,   44   4⅜\r\n    From principal floor to top of third tier of girders,    59   10\r\n    From principal floor to ridge of nave,                   67    4\r\n    From principal floor to top of bed-plate,                69   11\r\n    From principal floor to top of upper ring of dome,      123    6\r\n    From Sixth avenue curb-stone to top of lantern,         151\r\n    From Sixth avenue curb-stone to top of towers,           76    9\r\n          Area of first floor,       157,195 square feet.\r\n          Area of second floor,       92,496 square feet.\r\n                                       —-—--\r\n                 Total area,         249,692 or 5¾ acres.\r\n\r\nThe magnitude of these proportions alone, is calculated to excite\r\nfeelings of profound awe in the spectator’s mind; and when we see added\r\nthe gorgeous but subdued chromatic decoration with which the interior is\r\nornamented, and the innumerable works of art and industry with which it\r\nis so richly filled, we may well be proud of an erection which is\r\ndestined to confer lasting honor on the American name.\r\n\r\nIt was to be hoped that this splendid building, filled with the products\r\nof the industry and art of all nations, might have remained permanently\r\nin New York, to be an ornament to the city, and a museum for the\r\nentertainment and instruction of visitors from every part of the country\r\nand the world; but since the above was written, it has been decided that\r\nthe building is to be taken down, either for removal to some other\r\nplace, or for the sale of its materials.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     THE CRYSTAL PALACE IN LONDON.\r\n\r\nHaving spoken of the New York crystal palace, we now pass to the crystal\r\npalace of London, which preceded the former in the order of time, and\r\nfar surpassed it in size and magnificence. This splendid building,\r\nerected for the great exhibition of 1851, was located on the south side\r\nof Hyde park, near the Kensington road, in a position highly favorable\r\nin all respects to its intended objects. The construction of the edifice\r\npresented not a few difficulties. The building committee, comprising\r\nsome of the leading architects and engineers of Great Britain,\r\nadvertised for plans to be presented for the building; and as the\r\nresult, no less than two hundred and forty designs were laid before\r\nthem. A large part of these were at once put aside as utterly worthless;\r\nand then from about sixty, which were thought worthy of consideration,\r\nthe committee proceeded to prepare a design which pleased nobody, not\r\neven themselves. This plan, however, such as it was, was decided upon,\r\nand advertisements were issued for proposals to build it. Objections\r\nwere at once raised, both against the plan proposed, and the possibility\r\nof its execution; but while the committee, perplexed with the\r\ndifficulties suggested, were doubting what they should do, relief came\r\nto them from an unexpected quarter, which we must go back a little to\r\nexplain.\r\n\r\nIn 1839, Sir Robert Schomburg, a distinguished botanist, in going up the\r\nriver Berbice, in Demerara, had discovered in the still waters of the\r\nstream, a gigantic water-lily, of a shape hitherto unknown, and had\r\ntransmitted some of its seeds to England, where the plant growing from\r\nthem, under the care of Joseph Paxton, the head gardener of the Duke of\r\nDevonshire, was called the Victoria Regia. This plant was the occasion,\r\nand in some respects the model for the crystal palace. Every means was\r\nadopted to place this wonderful exotic in its accustomed circumstances.\r\nA tropical soil was formed for it, of burned loam and peat. Coal-heat\r\nwas substituted for that of the tropical sun; and by means of a wheel, a\r\nripple, like that of its native river, was communicated to the waters of\r\nthe tank upon which its broad leaves reposed in beauty. In these\r\ncircumstances the lily grew luxuriantly, and Mr. Paxton was obliged to\r\nplan an edifice capable of holding it. This he was doing just about the\r\ntime when the committee were poring wearily over their two hundred and\r\nforty plans; and in June, he drew out a design for the exhibition\r\nbuilding, which had been suggested to his mind while preparing an abode\r\nfor the Victoria Regia. In ten days he had completed his elevations,\r\nsections, working plans and specifications; and the whole being\r\nsubmitted to the inspection of competent and influential persons, was\r\nunanimously declared to be practicable, and the only practicable scheme\r\npresented.\r\n\r\nThe design, thus prepared, was next laid before the contractors, Messrs.\r\nFox & Henderson, who at once determined to submit a tender for the\r\nconstruction of a building in accordance with it. And in a single week,\r\nthey had calculated the amount and cost of every pound of iron, every\r\npane of glass, every foot of wood, and every hour of labor, which would\r\nbe required, and were prepared with an offer and specifications for the\r\nconstruction of the edifice. But here arose a difficulty. The committee\r\nhad advertised only for proposals for carrying out their own design;\r\nbut, fortunately, they had invited the suggestion, on the part of\r\ncontractors, of any improvements on it; and so Mr. Paxton’s plan was\r\npresented simply as “an improvement” upon that of the committee, though\r\nit had not a single feature in common with it. This, with certain\r\nmodifications, was adopted; and the result was the celebrated crystal\r\npalace, the first of the name, and the suggester of all others of the\r\nsame general character—the great, _original_ crystal palace; itself the\r\ngreatest wonder of the most wonderful exhibition the world has ever\r\nseen!\r\n\r\nThe building consisted, or rather still consists, of three series of\r\nelevations, of the respective hights of sixty-four, forty-four, and\r\ntwenty-four feet, intersected at the central point of meeting, by a\r\ntransept of seventy-two feet in width, having a semicircular roof rising\r\nto the hight of one hundred and eight feet in the center. It extended in\r\nlength eighteen hundred and fifty-one feet from north to south, or more\r\nthan one-third of a mile, with a breadth of four hundred and fifty-six\r\nfeet on the ground; thus covering a surface of some eighteen acres, or\r\nnearly double the extent of Washington square in New York, and\r\nexceeding, by more than one-half, the dimensions of the Park or the\r\nBattery. The whole rested upon cast-iron pillars, united by bolts and\r\nnuts, fixed to flanges perfectly true, so that if the socket was placed\r\nlevel, the columns and connecting pieces could not but stand upright;\r\nand in point of fact, not a single crooked line, it is said, was\r\ndiscoverable in the combination of such an immense number of pieces in\r\nthe building as first erected, or as it now stands. For the support of\r\nthe columns, holes were dug in the ground, in each of which was placed a\r\nbed of concrete, and upon this rested the iron sockets, of from three to\r\nfour feet in length, according to the level of the ground; to which\r\nsockets the columns were firmly attached by bolts and nuts. At the top,\r\neach column was attached by a girder to its opposite column, both\r\nlongitudinally and transversely, so that the whole eighteen acres of\r\npillars were securely framed together.\r\n\r\nThe roofs, of which there were five, one to each of the elevations, were\r\nconstructed on the ridge and furrow principle, and glazed with sheets of\r\nglass of forty-nine inches in length. The construction will be easily\r\nunderstood, by imagining a series of parallel rows of the letter V,\r\nextending (thus, VVV) in uninterrupted lines the whole length of the\r\nbuilding. The apex of each ridge was formed by a wooden sash-bar, with\r\nnotches on each side for holding the laths in which the edges of the\r\nglass were fitted. The bottom bar, or rafter, was hollowed at the top,\r\nso as to form a gutter to carry off the water, which passed through\r\ntransverse gutters into the iron columns, which were made hollow so as\r\nto serve as water-pipes; while in the base of each column a horizontal\r\npipe was inserted to convey the accumulated water into the sewers. The\r\nexhalations from so large a surface, from the plants and from the breath\r\nof the innumerable visitors, rising against the glass and there being\r\ncondensed, would, if the roof had been _flat_, have descended in the\r\nform of a perpetual mist, or dropping rain; but it was found that from\r\nglass pitched at a particular angle, the moisture did not _fall_, but\r\nwould glide down its surface. The bottom bars, therefore, were grooved\r\non the inside, thus forming interior gutters, by which the moisture\r\nfound its way down the interior of the columns, and thus through the\r\ndrainage pipes into the sewers. These grooved rafters, of which the\r\ntotal length was two hundred and five miles, were formed by machinery,\r\nat a single operation.\r\n\r\nThe lower tier of the building was boarded; the walls of the upper\r\nportion being composed, like the roof, of glass. Ventilation was\r\nprovided for by the basement portion being walled with iron plates,\r\nplaced at an angle of forty-five degrees, known as _luffer-boarding_,\r\nwhich admits the air freely, while it excludes the rain. A similar\r\nprovision was made at the top of each tier of the building; the plates\r\nall being so constructed that they could be closed at pleasure. In order\r\nto subdue the intense light in a building having such an immense extent\r\nof glass surface, the whole roof and the south side were covered with\r\ncanvas, which also precluded any possible injury from hail, as well as\r\nrendered the edifice much cooler than it otherwise would have been.\r\n\r\nIn the construction of the building the utmost care was taken to give\r\neach part the stiffest and strongest form possible in a given quantity\r\nof material. The columns were hollow; and the girders which united them\r\nwere trellis-formed. The utmost weight which it was supposed any girder\r\nwould be likely to have upon it, was seven and a half tuns; and not one\r\nwas used till after having been tested to the extent of fifteen tuns;\r\nwhile the breaking weight was calculated at thirty tuns. At first sight\r\nit would seem as if there might be danger that a building presenting so\r\nvast a surface to the action of the wind, might be liable to be blown\r\ndown, or at least forced out of position. But from the manner in which\r\nthe columns were framed together, they could not be overthrown except by\r\nbreaking them; and experiments showed, that in order to break the one\r\nthousand and sixty columns on the ground floor, a force of sixty-three\r\nhundred and sixty tuns must be exerted, at a hight of twenty-four feet.\r\nBut the greatest force of the wind known, is computed at twenty-two\r\npounds to the superficial foot; so that assuming even a force of\r\ntwenty-eight pounds, and supposing a hurricane with that momentum to\r\nstrike at once the whole side of the building, the total force, it was\r\nsaid, would be less than fifteen hundred tuns, not one-fourth what the\r\nbuilding could easily sustain, independently of the bracings, which\r\nadded materially to its strength. So that, if any reliance at all could\r\nbe placed on theoretical engineering, there could, it was said, be no\r\ndoubt whatever but that the building would be safe in the most violent\r\ntempest.\r\n\r\nThe building being thus erected, the spectator entering at the main east\r\nor west entrance, found himself in a nave sixty-four feet in hight, and\r\nseventy-two in breadth, and extending without interruption the whole\r\nlength of the building, one-third of a mile. Parallel with this, but\r\ninterrupted by the transept in the center, was a series of side aisles,\r\nof forty-eight and twenty-four feet in breadth, and with a hight of\r\nforty-four and twenty-four feet. And over the center of the nave,\r\nswelled the semicircular roof of the transept, overarching the stately\r\ntrees beneath; thus forming a gigantic green-house, with the ancient\r\nelms of the park in the place of geraniums and rose-bushes. The whole\r\narea of the ground-floor was seven hundred and seventy-two thousand,\r\nseven hundred and eighty-four square feet, and that of the galleries,\r\ntwo hundred and seventeen thousand; making in all nearly a million\r\nsquare feet, to which should be added five hundred thousand feet of\r\nhanging space, available for the display of the innumerable products of\r\nhuman skill and labor, that made the exhibition one of the most wondrous\r\nof all the wonders of the world.\r\n\r\nThere were three refreshment rooms; one in the transept, and one near\r\neach end of the building, around the huge trees of the park, which, as\r\nalready said, were left standing. No wine, spirits or fermented liquors\r\nwere allowed to be sold, but only tea, coffee and unfermented drinks;\r\nwhile pure water was to be furnished gratis to all, by the lessees of\r\nthe refreshment rooms. As to the decoration of the interior, it may here\r\nbe added, that the shafts of all the columns were painted yellow; the\r\nconcave portions of the capitals, blue; the under sides of the girders,\r\nred; and their vertical surfaces, white.\r\n\r\nWe might dwell in detail on the vast collection of the products of human\r\nindustry and art which filled the interior of this immense structure,\r\nand made it the resort of visitors from every part of the world. But the\r\nhistory of “the great exhibition” is familiar to most if not all of our\r\nreaders. We will only add, that among all the wonders of the crystal\r\npalace, nothing was more wonderful than its cheapness, and the rapidity\r\nof its construction. Possession of the site was obtained on the\r\nthirtieth of July; and in a period of one hundred and forty-five working\r\ndays, the building was mainly completed. Its _cost_ was less, by the\r\ncubic foot, than an ordinary barn. If it had been used only for the\r\nexhibition, and at its close returned to the contractors, its cost would\r\nhave been nine-sixteenths of a penny per foot; and if it had been left\r\nremaining permanently, it would have been but one penny and one-twelfth\r\nof a penny per foot. The astonishing fact, that a building of glass and\r\niron, including thirty-three million cubic feet, and covering eighteen\r\nacres, and affording room for nine miles of tables, should have been\r\ncompleted in less than five months from the day when the contract was\r\nentered into, at a cost less than that of the humblest hovel, opens a\r\nnew era in the art of building.\r\n\r\nSilliman, in his late “Visit to Europe,” under the date of the\r\ntwenty-ninth of March, 1851, says: “Into this wonderful and imposing\r\nstructure we have to-day merely made our entrance. As we drove along the\r\neastern side of Hyde park, on a bright and beautiful morning, the\r\nsplendid vision caught our eyes, as the sunlight was thrown wide around\r\nby this immense mirror. It was merely a glance that we took on this\r\noccasion, reserving more deliberate observation for future\r\nopportunities. It was not accessible, as yet, to visitors, but by\r\nparticular favor, through an introduction to one of the managers, we\r\nwere admitted into the interior. It has become so familiar, in all its\r\naspects, to the whole world, that at this date, after its complete\r\ndevelopment, any detailed description would be out of place. The general\r\nimpression made upon us, by our walks through this stupendous\r\nconservatory of the arts, was that of great splendor and magnificence.\r\nIt appeared a fairy palace, like the creations of fable; a building\r\nequally unique and original in its structure; original, also, in its\r\nbearing upon the concord and amicable rivalry of nations; in this\r\nrespect of most auspicious tendency. Already the consignments of the\r\nworld are coming in, and to a great extent have actually arrived.\r\nAfrican Tunis sends its contributions, and even more remote countries\r\nare beginning to occupy the large space allotted to them. The palace is\r\nso high as to cover several of the large trees of Hyde park, where it is\r\nerected; and we saw, not without a shudder, a man dangling in the air at\r\nthe end of a rope near the roof, at the hight of eighty feet. He had\r\nbeen drawn up simply by holding on the end of the rope by his hands, and\r\nwas whirled around and around, until he reached a plank almost in the\r\nangle of the roof, where at last he was safely landed.”\r\n\r\nAnd at a later date, he adds: “Although I have walked many hours, and I\r\npresume ten miles in this immense structure, I seem only to have begun\r\nto see it. In despair of my ability to convey any adequate idea of it, I\r\nam almost disposed to pass it in silence, but this would disappoint\r\nthose for whom I write. Pictures and descriptions of the building had\r\nreached America before I left home, and it is known that its front\r\nextends more than one-third of a mile, besides its branches. The area\r\nwhich it covers is eighteen acres, and under its vaulted transept are\r\nincluded some large and lofty trees that were growing in the park. So\r\nmany accounts of its contents, and so many views of its form, both\r\nwithin and without, have been since published, that a better idea of\r\nboth can be obtained from numerous sources, than from anything that I\r\ncan write. I shall, therefore, attempt nothing more than some general\r\nremarks, and will mention a few examples. When we were here in March, I\r\nexpressed my admiration of the general design. So far as I know it is\r\nnovel. Exhibitions of the productions, whether in nature or art, of\r\nparticular countries, have often been made, and in some countries they\r\nare annual, as in France, England, and in the United States; but I\r\nbelieve it was reserved for Prince Albert to originate the design of\r\ninviting all nations to bring to one place the results of their industry\r\nand skill, and specimens of their physical resources. For obvious\r\nreasons, no place was so proper as London, the commercial metropolis of\r\nthe world, and I suppose now containing a greater population, and\r\ncertainly more wealth, and exerting more influence on mankind, than any\r\nother city. The invitation was a pledge of universal good-will, and it\r\nhas evidently tended to produce kind feelings among the nations. Instead\r\nof new fortresses of stone and iron, instead of walls and battlements to\r\nprotect this immense city from invasion, there rises in its grand domain\r\nof Hyde park, a crystal palace, the temple of arts and industry. It rose\r\nlike an exhalation, a magical illusion of the senses. The frame-work of\r\niron, although strong enough to sustain the weight and to resist the\r\nwinds, is so little apparent to the eye, that the crystal palace appears\r\na sea of glass, as in the Revelations, ‘A sea of glass like unto\r\ncrystal.’ One might dream, as in the ‘Arabian Nights,’ of such a\r\ncreation, ‘in the visions of the night, when deep sleep falleth upon\r\nmen,’ and might find on waking that it was all an illusion, when it\r\nwould vanish like the fabric of a dream, and leave not a wreck behind.\r\nBut there it stands, a splendid reality, and with its widely extended\r\ntransepts, wings and galleries, has proved sufficient to receive and\r\nprotect the gathered riches of mankind.\r\n\r\n“I mentioned in my passage from Boulogne, that I was in company with a\r\nlarge number of French people coming over to see the crystal palace.\r\nCrowds of all nations throng this palace; fifty thousand, or sixty\r\nthousand, and sometimes seventy thousand in a day. As you walk about, or\r\nthread your way through the great masses of human beings that crowd the\r\navenues, you may hear half the languages of Europe, and some of those of\r\nthe orient. I imagined that before our return from the continent the\r\ndeluge of nations would have subsided, and this consideration was not\r\nwithout weight in inducing us to prefer a late inspection of the\r\nsplendid wonder; but in this particular we have been disappointed. The\r\nnumbers who daily resort to the crystal palace are undiminished: it may\r\nbe that there are fewer foreigners, but since the price has been reduced\r\nto a shilling, the country people come in, parents and children, and\r\nmothers with their infants; steamboats and cars are crowded, and it\r\nseems as if the rural population of the kingdom were all rushing into\r\nLondon.\r\n\r\n“As to the contents of the palace, it is impossible to enumerate them. A\r\nmere catalogue, with the most brief descriptive notices, would fill a\r\nlarge volume. I can only mention groups of things, with here and there a\r\nparticular instance. The collection embraces the useful as well as the\r\nfine arts. All kinds of agricultural machines are here to be seen, and\r\nthere are seeds, and specimens of crops, all duly arranged and labeled.\r\nThe American department has been somewhat undervalued, because it was\r\nnot so splendid, and was less full than the collections from some other\r\ncountries, but even the Times, which has generally an unfriendly bearing\r\nin relation to our country, has commended the American department on the\r\nscore of utility. Indeed, it was not reasonable to expect that a country\r\noccupied but two centuries by civilized people, should be able fully to\r\ncompete with nations who have been civilized for a thousand years; and\r\nour great distance, and the difficulty and expense of transporting\r\narticles across the ocean, and of coming over to look after them, must\r\nhave prevented our appearing as we do at home, in the great industrial\r\nexhibitions of New York, Philadelphia and Boston. I have seen such\r\ngatherings at Niblo’s and the Castle Garden, in New York, and in Boston,\r\nnot only of useful, but of elegant things, as I should feel proud to see\r\nin the American department in the crystal palace. Two agricultural\r\ninstruments are, however, spoken of as giving the palm to America above\r\nall competition. I refer to the plow and the reaping-machine of American\r\nmanufacture. The plow is said to have attained the perfection of form,\r\nand the reaping-machine to be recommended by its great utility.\r\n\r\n“Iron, as it is the material which, more than others, (wood excepted,)\r\ncontributes indispensable aid to the arts of life, occupies a\r\nconspicuous place in the exhibition. Its ores and its castings, and its\r\nwrought articles, whether in a locomotive, or the hair-spring of a\r\nchronometer, whether in chain-cables or a cambric needle, are displayed\r\nin endless variety of useful and beautiful forms, and in this department\r\nEngland justly claims and fully proves her preëminence. Iron, lead,\r\ncopper, bismuth, zinc, antimony, and silver, gold and platinum, are\r\nconspicuous here. England glories in her tin, lead and copper: in the\r\ntwo latter we can compete with her; our lead is inexhaustible, and our\r\nnative copper of Lake Superior, is unequaled for abundance. A large mass\r\nof it has been brought over for the exhibition, weighing many thousand\r\npounds.\r\n\r\n“Nothing can exceed the beauty of the articles of silver, whether\r\nutensils or ornaments, which are exposed to view in the gallery of the\r\ncrystal palace. The most graceful forms both of peaceful men, and of\r\nwarriors, armed cap-à-pie; and of woman in the very _beau ideal_ of her\r\nloveliness, are here in profusion; and if England excels in these\r\narticles in silver, France is not behind her, both in them and in gilded\r\nfurniture, and bronze, as seen in all the splendor and elegance of the\r\nshow windows of the Palais Royal. The silver extracted from lead by\r\nPattinson’s process is here seen in piles so rich, with a perfect purity\r\nof whiteness, and in scaly pyramids, a kind of flaky mound, that the\r\nobserver looks on with delight, as also upon the same metal cast in\r\nponderous ingots. Here is the gold of California, one brilliant mass\r\nweighing in value eight hundred pounds sterling, equivalent to nearly\r\nfour thousand dollars. There are three masses of native Siberian, or\r\nRussian platinum, weighing respectively twenty-one, twenty-three, and\r\ntwenty-five pounds, and many wrought articles of the same metal. The\r\ncopper of Russia, in the form of malachite, here makes a great figure.\r\nThe same material which we saw in the Vatican, and in the palace of the\r\nking of Prussia, in the form of magnificent vases, is here seen wrought\r\ninto innumerable forms of beauty. There is even a large paneled door\r\nfabricated entirely of malachite. Of course many pieces are united to\r\nafford the requisite mass. There are tables, vases, urns, chairs,\r\nsettees, &c., mounted with the same rich material. The gems form a\r\nconspicuous ornament of the collection. Queen Victoria has loaned her\r\nlargest diamond, with several smaller ones, to be exhibited, and here\r\nalso are some of the most precious of the diamonds, rubies, sapphires,\r\ntopazes, emeralds, chrysoberyls, opals, and pearls of the regalia of\r\nRussia, Spain and India. The Duke of Devonshire has an emerald deposited\r\nby Mr. Tenant, nearly two inches in the diagonal diameter, and two to\r\nthree inches in length; it is of surpassing beauty, being perfectly\r\ncrystallized, and of the most intense and uniform grass-green color.\r\nThere is no end to the _bijouterie_ of the French. A case in the gallery\r\nis composed of four pieces of plate glass, each between five and six\r\nfeet long, and four to five broad. This case is entirely filled with\r\nelegant ornamental articles.\r\n\r\n“I can not pretend to enumerate the marbles, granites, porphyries,\r\nserpentines, and other architectural materials, nor the piles of mineral\r\ncoal, and anthracite, nor the perfect imitations of beautiful and useful\r\nmineral compositions, such as serpentines, verd-antique, porphyry, and\r\nverd-antique marbles, &c. The _chemical products_, too, of great beauty,\r\nare numerous. The crystallizations of carbonate and bi-carbonate of\r\nsoda, of alum, of the prussiates, yellow and red, of the sulphate of\r\niron, and the sulphate of copper, and sal-ammoniac, are splendid, and\r\nevince that the chemical arts are not behind the mechanical. Large cakes\r\nof metallic antimony are crystallized in beautiful fern-like radiations.\r\n\r\n“France, Belgium, Holland, Austria, Germany, Prussia, Turkey, the\r\nBarbary states, Egypt, Bermuda, the East Indies, Canada, Australia, and\r\nother countries, have combined to decorate the crystal palace. Superb\r\nsilks have come from the east, and pictured stuffs, shawls, carpets,\r\n&c., from Germany; the antipodes have conspired to crown the glorious\r\nspectacle; plain and useful materials, leather, hemp, ropes of manilla\r\ngrass and of other fibrous vegetables, and glass and pottery in their\r\nvarieties, are not omitted. To give animation to the scene, steam\r\ngenerated out of doors is brought in through concealed tubes and applied\r\nto machinery. Cotton-gins and paper-making machines are at work, and the\r\npalace resounds with the noise of actual and productive labor. Ship\r\nmodels are presented in many forms, especially ships of war, in sections\r\nlongitudinal and transverse, with all their interior structure.\r\nLife-boats and life-preservers, and in harmony with them, mirrors for\r\nlight-houses; but in contrast, swords, pistols, revolvers, guns, dirks\r\nand daggers, and multiform contrivances to do the work of killing the\r\ngreatest number of men in the shortest time; such are man’s\r\ninconsistencies!\r\n\r\n“But time would fail to tell of the furniture, the carriages, the\r\nmusical instruments, the ceramic wares, and all the countless and\r\nindescribable throng of articles which contribute their effect in the\r\n_tout ensemble_ of this vast storehouse of the nations. The statuary\r\narranged along the naves is a conspicuous and interesting feature. Many\r\nof the prominent and more meritorious of these marbles, have since\r\nbecome so familiar from the engravings in the Art Journal and other\r\nillustrated works, that it is needless at this late day to call\r\nattention to them individually. The famous Amazon of Kiss, the same\r\nwhich was in London, is now the most remarkable artistic object in the\r\nAmerican crystal palace. The most interesting view is obtained from the\r\ngalleries of the moving masses of human life below. It is a panorama\r\nwhere multitudes are passing to and fro, and soon are seen no more,\r\nfleeting as the _jets-d’eau_ which sport among them from living\r\nfountains, that curl over and descend in graceful sweeps, and seem to\r\nenliven the stately palms and other living plants and trees which grace\r\nthe scene.”\r\n\r\nIn closing this extended notice of the crystal palace, we hardly need\r\nadd, that after the close of the great exhibition, it was taken down and\r\nremoved; and that at present, it rears its splendid form and stately\r\ntransepts in a new and more beautiful situation at Sydenham, with many\r\nimportant additions and improvements. It now stands in the midst of a\r\nmagnificent undulating park of three hundred acres, surrounded with\r\nrural delights, fountains, shaded walks and silvan temples; while\r\nwithin, it has been converted into a great permanent museum of arts,\r\nantiquities and science, with living groves of palms, enlivened by\r\nsinging birds and sparkling fountains. For eighteen pence the London\r\nartisan can visit it, including the ride out and back upon the railway.\r\nThis is being done by a private association at a cost of near four\r\nmillion dollars.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       THE CAPITOL AT WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\nAmong the public buildings at Washington, the capital city of the\r\nnation, the first in architectural merit, and in point of interest, is\r\nthe Capitol, which contains the halls of the national legislature, the\r\nsupreme court room, &c., &c. This building (a view of which, as it will\r\nappear when the enlargement now in progress is completed, is given in\r\nthe cut below) is situated on an eminence at the eastern part of the\r\ncity, about seventy feet above tidewater, its main front looking toward\r\nthe west. As it was before the commencement of the alterations and\r\nimprovements now in progress, it consisted of a center building, with\r\ntwo wings, having a total length of three hundred and fifty-two feet,\r\nand a depth at the wings of one hundred and twenty-one feet. The central\r\nbuilding contains a rotunda, ninety-six feet in diameter, and the same\r\nin hight, crowned by a magnificent dome which rises one hundred and\r\nforty-five feet from the ground. The wings, as they were, were each\r\nsurmounted by a flat dome. The eastern front, which was intended for the\r\nmain one, projects, including the steps, sixty-five feet, and is graced\r\nby a portico of twenty-two Corinthian columns, thirty feet in hight,\r\nforming a colonnade one hundred and sixty feet in length, presenting one\r\nof the most commanding fronts in the United States. The western front\r\nprojects eighty-three feet, including the steps, and is embellished with\r\na recessed portico of ten columns. This front, though not so imposing,\r\nin itself, as the eastern, commands the finest view anywhere to be had\r\nin Washington, overlooking all the central and western parts of the\r\ncity, and all the principal public buildings. On the steps of the east\r\nfront is a noble statue of Columbus, supporting a globe in his\r\noutstretched arm. In the interior of the western projection is the\r\nlibrary of Congress, a part of which was burned in the winter of 1851-2.\r\nBefore that event it contained over fifty thousand volumes. It has been\r\nrebuilt so as to be fire-proof.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CAPITOL AT WASHINGTON.]\r\n\r\nOn entering the rotunda, the first objects that strike the attention,\r\nare the paintings which adorn the walls. There are “The Declaration of\r\nIndependence,” “The Surrender of Burgoyne,” “The Surrender of\r\nCornwallis,” “Washington resigning his Commission,” “The Embarkation of\r\nthe Pilgrims at Leyden,” “The Landing of Columbus,” “The Baptism of\r\nPocohontas,” and “The Discovery of the Mississippi by De Soto.”\r\nSurrounding the rotunda, are a number of chambers, passages,\r\ncommittee-rooms, rooms for the president, members of the cabinet, &c.\r\nThe senate-chamber is on the second floor of the north wing, of which it\r\noccupies about half, and is of a semicircular form, being seventy-five\r\nfeet long, and forty-five high. A gallery for spectators, supported by\r\niron or bronze pillars, surrounds the semicircle, and fronts the chair\r\nof the presiding officer, which stands in the middle of the chord of the\r\nsemicircle. In the rear of the chair, and above it, is a gallery,\r\nsupported by Ionic columns of the conglomerate or Potomac marble, in\r\nwhich sit the reporters, fronting the senators. The hall of\r\nrepresentatives is on the second floor of the south wing, and is also\r\nsemicircular, but much larger than the senate-chamber, being ninety-six\r\nfeet long, and sixty high, and surrounded by twenty-four Corinthian\r\ncolumns of Potomac marble, with capitals of Italian marble. The\r\ngalleries are similar in their arrangement to those of the\r\nsenate-chamber. Over the chair of the speaker is a statue of Liberty,\r\nsupported by an eagle with spread wings. In front of the chair, and\r\nimmediately above the main entrance, is a figure representing History\r\nrecording the events of the nation.\r\n\r\nThe enlargement of the Capitol, commenced in 1851, and now in progress,\r\nwill, however, materially change and improve its appearance. It will\r\ncomprehend two wings, two hundred and thirty-eight by one hundred and\r\nforty feet, which are to be surrounded on three sides by colonnades, and\r\non the fourth side to communicate by corridors, forty-four feet long and\r\nfifty feet wide, with the main building. The whole will be seven hundred\r\nand fifty-one feet long, and will cover three and one-half acres, or\r\nmore than one hundred and fifty-three thousand square feet. The\r\narchitect of the new building has completed the design of a magnificent\r\nnew dome for the center of the enlarged building, which is said to be a\r\nsplendid conception of genius, and which is to take the place of the\r\npresent dome, and thus perfect the symmetry and architectural beauty of\r\nthe entire building when complete. It will be constructed entirely of\r\ncast iron, and will be on the foundation of the old dome. And if it at\r\nall meets the expectations formed of it, it will be a lasting monument\r\nof the skill and genius of the architect.\r\n\r\nThe whole cost of the building as it now stands, before the extension,\r\nwas some two million dollars; but the improvement will cost several\r\nmillions more. The original structure was commenced in 1793, and had not\r\nbeen completed when it was burned, by an act of vandalism, in 1814; and\r\nwas not entirely finished till 1828. The grounds around the Capitol,\r\nembracing some thirty acres, and forming an oblong on three sides, and a\r\nsemicircle on the west, are handsomely laid out, and planted with trees\r\nand shrubbery, presenting, during the spring and summer, a scene of\r\ngreat beauty. About the center of the grounds, on the eastern front, is\r\na colossal statue of Washington, by Greenough. The material of the\r\nCapitol is a porous stone of a light yellow color, painted white. The\r\nenlargement is to be of marble.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTE.\r\n\r\nSouth-west from the Capitol, and midway between it and the president’s\r\nhouse, on a gently rising ground, in the midst of a new park which has\r\nrecently been laid out, stands the Smithsonian Institute, one of the\r\nnoblest institutions and finest structures in Washington, a view of\r\nwhich is given in the cut beyond.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Smithsonian]\r\n\r\nThis edifice is four hundred and fifty feet long, by one hundred and\r\nforty wide, and is built of red sand-stone, in the Romanesque or Norman\r\nstyle, embellished by nine towers, from seventy-five to one hundred and\r\nfifty feet high, and of different forms. In the building is a\r\nlecture-room, large enough to seat some two thousand persons; a museum,\r\nfor objects of natural history, some two hundred feet long; one of the\r\nbest supplied laboratories in the United States; a gallery for paintings\r\nand statuary; a library-room, capable of containing one hundred thousand\r\nvolumes; and various other smaller apartments connected with the designs\r\nof the building. The institution was endowed by James Smithson, an\r\nEnglishman, who left his whole fortune, some five hundred thousand\r\ndollars, “to found, at Washington, an establishment for the increase and\r\ndiffusion of knowledge among men.” The fund, which is in the keeping of\r\nthe United States government, yields an income of more than thirty\r\nthousand dollars per year; and this increase is divided into two parts,\r\none of which is to be devoted to the increase and diffusion of knowledge\r\nby means of original research and publications, and the other to the\r\ngradual formation of a library, a gallery of art, museum, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        THE WASHINGTON MONUMENT.\r\n\r\nOn the proposed new park, and between the Smithsonian Institute and the\r\npresident’s house, has been commenced a colossal monument to the memory\r\nof Washington, to be erected by the voluntary contributions of the\r\npeople. A view of it, as it will appear when completed, is given in the\r\ncut.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE WASHINGTON MONUMENT.]\r\n\r\nThe plan contemplates, as a base, a circular temple, two hundred and\r\nfifty feet in diameter, and one hundred feet high, from the center of\r\nwhich is to rise a shaft, seventy feet square, to the hight of six\r\nhundred feet above the ground, and to be cased in marble. The base is\r\nintended to be the Westminster Abbey of the United States, to contain\r\nthe statues of the revolutionary worthies, and in the center, (if his\r\nfamily approve,) are to be placed the remains of Washington. The temple,\r\nat the base, will be entirely surrounded by a colonnade of thirty\r\npillars, in the Doric style, forty-five feet high by twelve in diameter,\r\nsurmounted by an entablature of twenty feet, which, in turn, is to be\r\nsurmounted by a balustrade of fifteen feet in hight. Each state in the\r\nunion is invited to furnish a block of native stone or other material,\r\nwith an inscription, which will be inserted in the interior, where the\r\nblock may be seen and the inscription read in coming ages. A triumphal\r\ncar, with a statue of Washington, is to stand over the grand entrance,\r\nas seen in the engraving. The column, at present, has reached the hight\r\nof less than two hundred feet; but if completed according to the\r\noriginal plan, it will form the most magnificent monument ever erected.\r\nIt is said that there is not a column, either ancient or modern, in\r\nEurope, as high as the Bunker-hill monument. And yet, such are the\r\ngigantic proportions of the Washington monument, that Bunker-hill\r\nmonument could be placed inside of it without much impeding the\r\noperations of the workmen; and when it is finished, any two of the\r\nmonuments of Europe could be stowed away within its walls without being\r\nnoticed from the exterior. The design has been severely criticised; and\r\nthe great hight of the column, receding so suddenly from so wide a base,\r\nhas been strongly objected to. But the plan was deliberately adopted\r\nafter much consideration, and when the work is finished, it will\r\ndoubtless be approved by the great mass of beholders. Certainly it will\r\nattract the gaze of thousands as a monument not merely to a _man_, but\r\nto _principles_ which should be dear to every American. The endowments\r\nof the great man whom it commemorates, were peculiarly adapted to the\r\nexigency which called them into action. He was brave, but cautious;\r\nearnest, yet calm; resolved, yet guarded against rash adventure; a\r\npatriot, in whose heart the love of country predominated; a statesman,\r\nin whose conduct every public virtue was exemplified; a citizen, whose\r\nintercourse with his fellow-men was without reproach. Placed in a\r\nposition at once responsible and perilous, he felt and was ever ready to\r\nacknowledge the overruling providence of God, by whose blessing alone he\r\ncould succeed. It was not one great quality which formed the character\r\nof Washington, but a rare union of many great qualities. These, with\r\nunfeigned devotion, he laid on the altar of his country, and for the\r\npromotion of her interests he was ready to sacrifice his personal\r\ncomfort and his life. Wonderfully was he sustained in his self-denying\r\nand eventful career, and remarkable was the success which accompanied\r\nhis efforts. The most formidable obstacles were surmounted, the most\r\npowerful opposition subdued; his country was liberated; the battle of\r\nfree institutions was fought and won; and he, superior to the impulses\r\nof mere personal ambition, nevertheless achieved a fame which has no\r\nparallel in the world’s history. If he was “first in war,” he was “first\r\ntoo in peace,” and he still remains “first in the hearts of his\r\ncountrymen.” Such a name should never be forgotten; such an example\r\nshould never lose its influence.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     THE COLUMN OF VENDOME, PARIS.\r\n\r\nThe _Place de Vendome_, formed upon the site of a hotel that belonged to\r\nthe Duke de Vendome, was begun by Louis XIV., who, in 1685, purchased\r\nand leveled the hotel, intending to erect, round a public place,\r\nedifices for the royal library, the mint, the extraordinary embassadors,\r\n&c. This project, however, was abandoned, and the property ceded to the\r\ncity of Paris, with a stipulation to erect a _place_ upon the site.\r\nMansard, who furnished the first plans, was charged with the second; and\r\nthe buildings, as they now stand, were begun in 1699, and finished by\r\nthe financier Law. The form of the place is a symmetrical octagon, the\r\nlarger sides of which measure respectively, four hundred and twenty and\r\nfour hundred and fifty feet. Two wide streets, forming the only\r\nentrances to it, the _Rue de la Paix_ and the _Rue de Castiglione_,\r\nequisect its northern and southern sides. The buildings are uniform,\r\nconsisting of a rustic basement surmounted by upper stories, ornamented\r\nwith Corinthian pilasters, and high roofs pierced with lucarne windows.\r\nThe middle of each side is graced with a pediment supported by\r\nCorinthian columns. This place was first called the _Place des\r\nConquêtes_, then the _Place Louis le Grand_, and afterward the _Place\r\nVendome_. In the middle formerly stood a colossal equestrian statue of\r\nLouis XIV., in bronze, erected in 1669, but demolished the tenth of\r\nAugust, 1792; the bronze figures that ornamented its base were saved,\r\nand are still to be seen in the _Musée de la Sculpture Moderne_. The\r\nmutilated pedestal remained till 1806, when it was replaced by the\r\ntriumphal pillar, erected by Napoleon, to commemorate the success of his\r\narms in the German campaign of 1805. This column is an imitation of the\r\npillar of Trajan at Rome, of which it preserves the proportions on a\r\nscale larger by one-twelfth. Its total elevation is one hundred and\r\nthirty-five feet, and the diameter of the shaft is twelve feet. The\r\npedestal is twenty-one feet in hight, and from seventeen to twenty in\r\nbreadth. The pedestal and shaft are of stone, covered with bass-reliefs,\r\nrepresenting victories of the French army, in bronze, made from twelve\r\nhundred pieces of brass cannon taken from the Russians and Austrians.\r\nThe metal employed in this monument weighs about three hundred and sixty\r\nthousand pounds. The bass-reliefs of the pedestal represent the\r\nuniforms, armor and weapons of the conquered troops. Above the pedestal\r\nare garlands of oak, supported at the four angles by eagles, each\r\nweighing five hundred pounds. The door, of massive bronze, is decorated\r\nwith crowns of oak, surmounted by an eagle of the highest finish; above\r\nis a bass-relief, representing two figures of Fame, supporting a tablet,\r\nwith an inscription in honor of Napoleon, and commemorating the\r\nvictories which the column was erected to celebrate. The bass-reliefs of\r\nthe shaft pursue a spiral direction to the capital, and display, in\r\nchronological order, the principal actions, from the departure of the\r\ntroops from Boulogne to the battle of Austerlitz. The figures are three\r\nfeet high; their number is said to be two thousand, and the length of\r\nthe scroll eight hundred and forty feet; a spiral thread divides the\r\nlines, and bears inscriptions of the actions they represent. The figure\r\nof Napoleon on the top of the column, is eleven feet high. The statue of\r\nNapoleon, in imperial robes, was melted down in 1814, to form a part of\r\nthe equestrian statue of Henry IV., but was replaced by Louis Philippe,\r\nMay first, 1832, clad in military costume, shrouded by crape. From the\r\nsummit of the monument, which is reached by a spiral staircase, there is\r\na splendid view of the capital, and admission is obtained through one of\r\nNapoleon’s veterans, who keeps the door.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       THE BUNKER HILL MONUMENT.\r\n\r\nThis celebrated monument, a view of which is given in the cut on the\r\nnext page, is in the town of Charlestown, Mass., on the hill where the\r\nfirst battle was fought between the provincial and British troops in the\r\nwar of the revolution. The hill was originally called Breed’s hill,\r\nBunker hill being to the north of it, at the entrance of the peninsula\r\non which Charlestown is situated. On this hight a detachment of one\r\nthousand men were directed to intrench themselves, on the night of the\r\nsixteenth of June, 1775. By some mistake, they proceeded to Breed’s\r\nhill, which is nearer Boston, and which has since been called Bunker\r\nhill, as the name is associated with the battle. The men had worked with\r\nsuch secrecy, that by the dawn of day they had, unperceived by the\r\nenemy, thrown up a redoubt eight rods square. The incessant fire from\r\nthe shipping and a battery on Copp’s hill, in Boston, did not prevent\r\nthe Americans from completing by midday, with great labor and fatigue, a\r\nslight breastwork from the redoubt to the bottom of the hill on the east\r\nside. Between twelve and one o’clock, the British, to the number of\r\nthree thousand men, with a portion of artillery, under Generals Howe and\r\nPigot, landed in Charlestown, and having formed their men in two lines,\r\nadvanced slowly to the attack, frequently halting to allow their\r\nartillery time to fire. The Americans, in their intrenchments, coolly\r\nwaited their approach. It is said that General Putnam, who was a leader,\r\nthough Colonel Prescott had the chief command, told the men that they\r\nhad not a charge of powder to waste, and exhorted them not to fire upon\r\nthe enemy till they could see the whites of their eyes. They were\r\nsuffered to approach to within ten or twelve rods, when these practiced\r\nAmerican marksmen fired with such deadly aim as to throw the British\r\nranks into confusion, and cause them to retreat precipitately to the\r\nbottom of the hill. By the efforts of their officers they were formed a\r\nsecond time and advanced to the attack. The Americans waited till they\r\nwere within five or six rods, when they again opened a destructive fire,\r\nwhich brought them to a stand and threw them into confusion. At this\r\ncritical moment General Clinton arrived from Boston, and succeeded in\r\nrallying his men, and in bringing them to a charge, while some cannon\r\nwere brought to a station that enabled them to rake the breastwork from\r\nend to end. The works were now attacked with fixed bayonets, and as the\r\nAmericans were not furnished with them, and they found their ammunition\r\nbeginning to fail, they were obliged to retreat over Charlestown neck.\r\nThe British were victorious; but it was a dearly bought victory. Their\r\nloss, by the acknowledgment of General Gage, was ten hundred and\r\nfifty-four killed and wounded; while the engagement was particularly\r\nfatal to the officers, as they were singled out by the American\r\nmarksmen. Nineteen commissioned officers were killed, and seventy\r\nwounded. Of the men, two hundred and twenty-six were killed, and eight\r\nhundred and twenty-eight wounded; while of the Americans, who had only\r\nfifteen hundred men engaged, only one hundred and forty-five were\r\nkilled, and three hundred and four wounded and missing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Bunker Hill Monument]\r\n\r\nOn the site of this celebrated battle, sixty-two feet above the level of\r\nthe harbor, on ground purchased for the purpose, the Bunker hill\r\nmonument, a splendid obelisk, has been erected. The corner-stone was\r\nfirst laid by La Fayette, on the fiftieth anniversary of the battle, in\r\nthe presence of an immense concourse of citizens, the seventeenth of\r\nJune, 1825, when an address was delivered by Daniel Webster. This\r\nfoundation, however, having been found insufficient, the corner-stone of\r\nthe present structure was laid, in a more substantial manner, in March,\r\n1827; and the monument was completed the twenty-third of July, 1842. The\r\nobelisk is thirty feet square at the base, and sixteen and one-third\r\nfeet at the top; and is substantially built of hewn Quincy granite. The\r\nhight from the base to the top of the apex, is two hundred and\r\ntwenty-one feet; and the cost of the work was about one hundred and\r\ntwenty thousand dollars. The interior is circular, having a diameter of\r\nten feet and seven inches at the bottom, and of six feet and four inches\r\nat the top, and is ascended by two hundred and ninety-four steps. The\r\ntop is an elliptical chamber, about eighteen feet high, with four\r\nwindows, the view from which is truly magnificent, embracing Boston, and\r\nits harbor and environs, together with the mountain scenery in the\r\ndistance, and the adjacent towns nearer at hand. The monument consists\r\nof ninety courses of hewn stone, eighty-four above the base, and six\r\nbelow it. There are a number of windows in the sides, closed with iron\r\nshutters, beside numerous apertures. The completion of the monument in\r\n1842, was hailed by the firing of cannon, and other testimonials of\r\nrejoicing. The monument itself, being the most elevated object in the\r\nvicinity, will serve as a landmark to seamen, and will long stand in\r\ncommemoration of the brave men who here fought, and many of whom fell,\r\nin defense of the rights of their country, nobly contributing to the\r\nindependence of the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          THE ARC DE TRIOMPHE.\r\n\r\nThis triumphal arch, says a late tourist, “is one of the most wonderful\r\nconceptions of that wonderful man, Napoleon. It was begun by him, but\r\nfinished by his successors. This stupendous fabric strikes one with\r\nastonishment; and after we had opportunity to compare it with the\r\ntriumphal arches of the Roman emperors, we were still more impressed\r\nwith its grandeur. Dimensions are indispensable, if we would produce in\r\nothers any correct conceptions of structures or space; but they fail to\r\nimpress the mind as does the actual vision, and this is eminently the\r\nfact with this elaborate work. Napoleon decreed its erection in 1806,\r\nafter his successful campaigns in Prussia and Germany. The plan of the\r\ntriumphal arch was furnished in 1809. The foundations were sunk\r\ntwenty-five feet below the surface, and it was only above ground in\r\n1811. In 1814, the works were suspended, and remained neglected until\r\n1823. After various interruptions, the pile was finished by Louis\r\nPhilippe in 1836, thirty years from the decree which gave birth to it,\r\nand from the laying of the first stone. The cost was ten million, four\r\nhundred and twenty thousand francs, or over two million dollars. The\r\nmonument consists of a vast central arch, ninety feet in hight by\r\nforty-five in width, over which rises a bold entablature, frieze and\r\ncornice. There is also a transversal arch, fifty-seven feet high and\r\ntwenty-five feet wide. The total hight of the structure is a hundred and\r\nfifty-two feet, and its breadth and depth are a hundred and thirty-seven\r\nand sixty-eight feet respectively. These dimensions are more than\r\nrealized by actual inspection. The panels, frieze, and pediment of this\r\nstructure, are covered by figures in bold relief, eighteen feet in\r\nhight, three times the size of life, and those above are half of this\r\nsize. All of them illustrate the history of France, and they are chiefly\r\nwarlike. One group may be mentioned as an example. Victory is crowning\r\nNapoleon with a laurel wreath; History is writing the narrative of his\r\ndeeds, and Fame, soaring above, is proclaiming them with her trumpet.\r\n\r\n“The observer should ascend the monument, when he will realize more than\r\never its great hight and magnitude, and its massy materials. An aged\r\nwoman at the door furnished us with a lantern for our ascent through\r\ndark passages. The stairs are easy, although narrow, and we mounted,\r\nwithout difficulty, up the two hundred and sixty-one steps. The floor\r\nwhich covers the arches, is composed of very large stones, hewn into\r\nperfect symmetry. Notwithstanding the mountain weight of this structure,\r\nnot the slightest crack in the massy stones, or opening in the joints,\r\ncan be perceived, in any part of the pile. The top affords a secure and\r\nconvenient place for observation, and from this place the observer\r\nenjoys a glorious view of Paris and its environs. Away into the country\r\nstretches interminably, as far as the eye can discern, a beautiful road,\r\nalmost of the same ample width as that of the broad avenue, at the head\r\nof which the triumphal arch stands. Looking from the arch to the north,\r\nthe avenue leads through and along the Elysian Fields, the Place de la\r\nConcorde, the gardens and palace of the Tuilleries, the Carrousel and\r\npalace of the Louvre, all of which are in one continuous line of two or\r\nthree miles. On our right, looking east, are the dome of the Invalides,\r\nthe extensive Champs de Mars, and the Ecole Militaire near that field.\r\nThe triumphal arch of Napoleon in the Carrousel, the cathedral of Notre\r\nDame, and the commemorative column of July, 1830, erected on the site of\r\nthe ancient Bastile, are seen on the north-east. Alas! how much blood\r\nhas this arch of triumph cost. The places of ninety-six victories are\r\ngiven on the monument, with the names of the generals by whom they were\r\nwon, the latter making an aggregate of three hundred and eighty-four.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                         THE COOPER INSTITUTE.\r\n\r\nThis is a structure, not yet complete, but to be of huge proportions,\r\nthe foundations of which are imbedded deep in the earth, there resting\r\non masses of stone, from which, as they rise from the ground, they\r\nascend in columns and arches of iron. It is situated near the upper part\r\nof Broadway, in the city of New York, not far from the Astor library,\r\nthe Bible house, and the fine building of the Mercantile Library\r\nAssociation. Like the Bible house it covers a whole block, and extends\r\non every side as far as the streets which surround will allow. The space\r\ninclosed is nearly three-quarters of an acre. The ground is excavated to\r\nthe depth of twenty-five feet, to lay the broadest foundations, and also\r\nto furnish space below the level of the street for a large hall, which\r\nmay be used for public assemblies. Here, under one corner, is to be a\r\ncomplete apparatus for the manufacture of gas, and also for warming and\r\nventilating the whole building. From the pavement the edifice rises to\r\nsix stories, reaching a hight nine feet above the Bible house. The lower\r\nstory, which, from its long row of iron arches, presents a noble\r\nappearance, is intended for stores, the rent of which will be a\r\nperpetual endowment for the support of the institution. The second story\r\nis to be fitted up for offices, which will also be a source of revenue.\r\nWith the third story, commences the portion of the edifice devoted\r\nstrictly to scientific purposes. Here, occupying the body of the\r\nbuilding, is a hall, which will hold four thousand people, and will\r\nprobably be found the best place for lectures in the city, being much\r\nmore spacious and elegant than the Tabernacle. It will not be quite so\r\nlarge as the Academy of Music, which is out of all proportion with\r\nordinary speaking and hearing; but it will hold as large an audience as\r\ncan well get within the sound of one man’s voice. On this floor, a room\r\nof ample dimensions is set apart for a school of design for ladies. This\r\nis an admirable feature in the plan. It will furnish hundreds of young\r\nwomen, who have a taste for drawing, with facilities for becoming\r\nperfect in that accomplishment, and also with a means of support for\r\nsuch as wish to teach. Another spacious apartment is devoted to Egyptian\r\nantiquities. The fine collection brought to this country by Dr. Abbott\r\nhas been secured, and will form one of the attractions of the Cooper\r\nInstitute. Here will be placed the famous bulls, and all the wonders\r\nbrought from the land of the Nile. Other divisions of the building will\r\ncontain collections of natural history, of beasts, birds and reptiles.\r\nThus will be formed a grand museum, bringing together what is rare and\r\ncurious from the earth, air and sea. Here, too, the mineralogist and the\r\nbotanist will find a place for their collections, and the chemist be\r\nfurnished with his laboratory. Connected with these departments, there\r\nwill be professors and courses of lectures. The design of the benevolent\r\nfounder is to furnish to young men, free of expense, an education in any\r\nbranch of science or art. In many of its features, this institution is\r\nmodeled after the Polytechnic school in Paris. To every young man who\r\nhas a thirst for science, is here afforded the means of satisfying it.\r\nThe fountains of knowledge will be open to him, and he may drink freely.\r\nWe doubt not, many will avail themselves of this opportunity. Sir\r\nHumphrey Davy once said, the greatest discovery he ever made was the\r\ndiscovery of the poor Irish boy, Michael Faraday, now the world-renowned\r\nprofessor of London. May not such a one yet be picked up in the streets\r\nof New York, who will here find open to him a path to science and to\r\nfame. Many a country lad, whose desire for knowledge can not be\r\nsatisfied in a district school, will here find an ampler field of study.\r\nIn future years, the dwellers in that part of the city will often see,\r\nat midnight, the lights gleaming in those high windows, where ardent\r\nyouth pore over books, exploring that world of science then, for the\r\nfirst time, opened to their gaze. In another year, _i. e._, by 1856, we\r\nhope to see it in full operation. A structure so immense, of course, can\r\nadvance but slowly. It has been delayed, also, for want of stone, and in\r\norder to have made, specially for this building, iron girders, which\r\ntake the place of wood, and which give greater strength and security. It\r\nis guarded against fire, in every possible way, and built in the firmest\r\nmanner; and when completed, it will be a huge mass of rock and iron. It\r\nis built to last for ages, and will stand as a monument to the\r\nliberality of a private individual, who, having, on this very spot,\r\nbegun life himself as a poor boy, and risen, by a long course of\r\nindustry, to be one of the merchant princes of the land, desired to\r\nfound an institution for the benefit of the young men of his native\r\ncity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VERGNAIS’S HERCULEAN BRIDGE.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                      VERGNAIS’S IMPROVED BRIDGE.\r\n\r\nVarious plans have from time to time been formed, for giving strength\r\nand security to bridges; the history of which, from the time when\r\nstreams were first crossed by rude logs or trees thrown over them, up to\r\nthe latest inventions, would be full of interest. One of the latest\r\nimprovements in this department, designed and invented by an ingenious\r\nFrench engineer, M. Vergnais, is presented in the preceding cut. It was\r\noriginally intended to be thrown across the river Seine, at Paris. Some\r\nyears ago, a wire suspension bridge at Angiers gave way, while a body of\r\ntroops was crossing, precipitating an entire regiment into the water,\r\nwith a terrible loss of life. Since that dreadful catastrophe there has\r\nalways been a feeling of aversion in France, toward the erection of\r\nsuspension bridges. The ingenious improvement here presented is designed\r\nto relieve all possible danger of breakage, and yet allow of the\r\nconstruction of a bridge of gigantic proportions, without in the least\r\nimpeding navigation. In the ordinary suspension bridge, the main cables\r\nsustain the entire weight, and should the connection between the bridge\r\nand the cables give way, or either of the cables break, a most\r\nmelancholy end awaits all who have happened to be trusting their lives\r\nto its security at the moment. In the application of Vergnais’s\r\nimprovement, the utmost security is afforded. A monster arch of iron is\r\nthrown across from shore to shore. This arch is composed of such strong\r\nmaterials as not to require great bulk, so that it presents an aerial\r\nappearance. The flooring of the bridge is suspended from the arch by\r\ninnumerable pendants of iron, so that the weight of a body, in crossing\r\nthe bridge, is brought to bear gradually upon the structure, and when it\r\nreaches the center, where common bridges are the weakest, under this\r\ninvention it reaches the strongest part, for it is directly beneath the\r\narch. Besides, should any of the pendants give way, the entire bridge\r\ndoes not yield, for it is impossible for all the pendants to break at\r\nonce. This plan is certainly a new and novel one, so far as suspension\r\nbridges are concerned. We hope that the inventor will be encouraged to\r\nerect them in this country. Railroad companies will find them to be in\r\nevery way advantageous to their interest, since the cars may run across\r\nthem at the highest speed, with perfect security.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 RAILROAD BRIDGE AT PORTAGE, NEW YORK.\r\n\r\nA group of natural and artificial wonders more varied and magnificent\r\nthan at Portage, N. Y., is not to be found in this land of sublime\r\nscenery and rapid improvement. It is destined to be a Mecca of travel,\r\nonly to be classed with the White mountains, Niagara and the Mammoth\r\ncave. No descriptive language will appear exaggerated to one who visits\r\nthe scene, or studies the measurements and details now presented. These\r\ndo not tell half the story; a complete account would require a\r\nguide-book of pen-and-pencil sketches. The small village of Portage lies\r\non the Genessee river, at a point where it enters a stupendous gorge,\r\nwhich continues seventeen miles, in a north-east direction, to Mount\r\nMorris. Here it flows into the famous Genessee valley, which extends\r\nfrom Dansville to Rochester, and is a level tract of rich farms and\r\nshaded meadows, that are said to resemble English park scenery more than\r\nanything in our country. The river enters the lake a few miles below the\r\nRochester falls, thirty miles north of Mount Morris. To begin back, just\r\nbelow Portage village is a noble aqueduct of the Genessee canal: this is\r\nbuilt of hewn limestone, and is much like the high bridge at Harlem, in\r\nsize and appearance. Passing this and advancing into the river-gulf,\r\nwith the Genessee on one hand, the canal on the other, and two hundred\r\nand fifty feet of wooded declivity inclosing both, a short walk brings\r\nyou suddenly to the new bridge of the Buffalo and New York city\r\nrailroad. The first and last look at this bridge must be one of dumb\r\namazement. It is the crystal palace of all bridges. How any mortal ever\r\nconceived, or having conceived ever dared to attempt carrying it into\r\nexecution, passes our comprehension. Resting on six heavy stone\r\nbasements in the water, and as many more on the land, it rises to the\r\nimmense hight, for a bridge, of two hundred and thirty-four feet, and is\r\neight hundred feet long, lifting its immense net-work of timber, as if a\r\nwhole village of house-frames and rectangular streets were raised up and\r\nset perpendicularly on edge. The first fall of the river, a sidelong,\r\nbroken descent of sixty feet, is a few steps below the structure, and\r\nvisible from its top, long before reaching which the ascending mist is\r\ndissipated. One and a half million feet of timber, being the product of\r\ntwo hundred acres of land, together with thirty tuns of iron spikes,\r\nwere required for this climax of modern engineering. The cost is\r\nestimated at one hundred and thirty thousand dollars. Before the work\r\nhad reached its completion, the railroad passengers were taken in\r\ncarriages two miles around from one end of the bridge to the other, a\r\nvery comfortable hotel having been erected at the eastern extremity.\r\nBelow the monster bridge and its waterfall, the river chasm widens into\r\na deep basin of hills, with a pond in the center, and the second fall, a\r\ndescent of eighty feet, at the lower extremity. This grand natural\r\ntemple of cliffs, has thus at each end an organ with a shining range of\r\nsilver pipes; on the left side are several galleries in the shape of\r\ncanal aqueducts of wood, built to avoid the incessant slides of\r\nquicksand; and, at the upper entrance, the six-story bridge furnishes\r\nfifty rostrums for as many orators. Connected with the lower falls is a\r\nsingular semicircular chasm, and, at its base, a cave, worn by water,\r\nwhich, as a matter of course, has been afflicted with a Satanic name: it\r\nis of difficult access. Here begin the imposing precipices of three\r\nhundred feet in hight, forming, at this point, a mighty amphitheater,\r\naround the eastern brink of which winds the canal, protected by a stone\r\nparapet. A gigantic tunnel was first constructed, and still remains in\r\npart; but the rock proved so insecure, that the overhanging roof was\r\nthrown off, at great expense, into the river, and the bed of the canal\r\nlaid in cement. Nearly the whole array of these wonders could be brought\r\ninto one view from a high point on the western bank, where the artist\r\nCole, when this scenery was in its pristine wildness, once took a sketch\r\nfor a very large autumnal picture, which is now in the possession of\r\nHon. W. H. Seward. Some distance below the places now described, is a\r\nthird fall, very grotesque in its features, and made remarkable by a\r\ntall natural tower, left by the wearing of the river and surmounted by a\r\ncrown of foliage.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     THE BRITANNIA TUBULAR BRIDGE.\r\n\r\nThis wonder of modern engineering, a view of which is given in the cut,\r\nforms part of the railroad from Chester to Holyhead, and is thrown over\r\nthe Menai strait which separates Caernarvon, in Wales, from the island\r\nof Anglesey. This strait appears to the eye as a beautiful river, half a\r\nmile wide, through which the tide, which here rises twenty and\r\ntwenty-five feet, rushes with great rapidity and force. The tubular\r\nbridge over it is one hundred feet above high-water level, and formed of\r\nlong, hollow, rectangular tubes, one for up, and the other for down\r\ntrains, composed of wrought-iron boiler-plates riveted together, and\r\nresting on huge and massive towers of masonry. Of these tubes or\r\ngalleries, eight in number, four for each line, the four shortest are\r\neach two hundred and thirty feet, and the four longest each four hundred\r\nand seventy-two feet in length. The middle and largest pier or tower, is\r\nsixty-two feet by fifty-two at the base, and rises majestically to a\r\nhight of two hundred and thirty feet. The workmen engaged upon this\r\nbridge, with their wives and families, were equal in number to the\r\npopulation of a moderately sized town, and had the usual provisions for\r\nlarge communities, of a clergyman, schoolmaster, surgeon, _etc._ The\r\nentire cost of the stupendous structure, was about three million, five\r\nhundred thousand dollars. The number of rivets used in fastening the\r\ntubes of this bridge was over two million; and the entire length of it\r\nis eighteen hundred and thirty-four feet. Silliman says of this immense\r\nand ingenious structure, that it “is wonderful. To construct,” he adds,\r\n“a vast tube of iron strong enough to admit of railroad trains passing\r\nsafely through it; to build it in separate pieces down on the common\r\nlevel; to float them to the site, and there raise them to their\r\nelevation of one hundred feet, and place them on firm pillars of masonry\r\nas supports, and then to unite them into one continued tube, as part of\r\nthe grand railroad connection between London and Holyhead and Ireland,\r\nis an achievement which must forever place the name of Robert Stevenson\r\nabove all praise.” To show the immense strength of this bridge, he goes\r\non to say, “An enormous weight of between three and four hundred\r\nthousand pounds, caused a depression of the level only three inches. The\r\nordinary pressure of the railroad trains produces a depression of\r\none-eighth of an inch, or even less, discernible only by instruments. A\r\npressure of more than six hundred thousand pounds produced a deflection\r\nof less than an inch and a half. As works of art, this bridge, and the\r\none next to be mentioned, are triumphs of mechanical skill and science,\r\nand they not only establish the connection which has been named between\r\nWales, Anglesey and Ireland, but they afford the prospect of a still\r\nmore important connection from Galway, in Ireland, to Nova Scotia, by\r\nsteamers, thus bringing Europe and America within a week of each other.\r\nThe most massy stone pier, the Britannia, was erected upon a firm rock\r\nwhich is in the middle of the river. The term tube, as here applied to\r\nthe body of the bridge, may convey an erroneous idea; for instead of\r\nbeing round, it is square. It is an immense iron corridor, or\r\nparallelopiped, closed in, forming a horizontal iron gallery, or\r\npassage, in which the rails are laid. It is thirty feet high in the\r\nmiddle, and twenty-two feet toward the ends.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE BRITANNIA TUBULAR BRIDGE.]\r\n\r\n“This stupendous structure proves to be a very delicate thermometer. A\r\nlittle sunshine raises the center an inch, (as the expansion can not\r\nextend downward,) and produces a horizontal deflection or swelling of an\r\ninch and a half. For every fifteen degrees of Fahrenheit, it expands one\r\nten-thousandth of its length, or half an inch. Alternate sunshine and\r\nshowers of rain, cause the tubes to expand and contract. If one of the\r\ntubes was placed on end in St. Paul’s churchyard, London, it would rise\r\none hundred and seven feet higher than the top of the cross. The rivets\r\nthat unite the plates are an inch in diameter; they were put in red-hot,\r\nand beaten with heavy hammers, and in cooling, they contracted so\r\nstrongly as to draw the plates together with a force requiring four to\r\nsix tuns to make them slide on each other. The tubes were raised from\r\ntheir position afloat on the water, by means of a Brahmah hydraulic\r\npress, into which the water was injected by powerful steam-engines. The\r\nforce exerted by this power would throw water nearly twenty thousand\r\nfeet high; more than five times the hight of Snowdon, the highest\r\nmountain in Wales, and almost five thousand feet higher than the summit\r\nof Mont Blanc. The greatest number of men employed at any one time on\r\nthis bridge, was two thousand, and the fatal casualties were seven. The\r\nsecond tube was floated to its place December fourth, 1849, and the\r\nopening of the bridge by the passage of cars took place March fifth,\r\n1850. It may be deflected thirteen inches without injury, and would bear\r\na weight of one thousand tuns.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                         THE SUSPENSION BRIDGE.\r\n\r\nIn the same vicinity, and over the same strait, is the great suspension\r\nbridge, which, when it was finished in 1826, was deservedly esteemed one\r\nof the wonders of the world, and is still entitled to hold that rank. It\r\nis indeed a stupendous structure, of which the full details may be\r\nlearned from the official reports; but the following are among the\r\nprincipal facts. It is one hundred feet above the water, so that the\r\nships, even those of a large size, are not impeded, and can pass under\r\nit without lowering a sail or a spar. The bridge is built out upon\r\narches from both sides of the river, to a certain distance, leaving the\r\nspace between the points of suspension, five hundred and sixty feet. The\r\nplatform is about thirty feet wide. The whole is suspended from four\r\nlines of strong iron cables, by perpendicular iron rods, five feet\r\napart. The cables pass over rollers, on the tops of pillars, and are\r\nfixed to iron frames under ground, which are kept down by masonry. The\r\nweight of the whole bridge between the points of suspension is four\r\nhundred and eighty-nine tuns. The massy materials of which this bridge\r\nis composed, the admirable manner in which they are locked together, the\r\ngreat elevation at which it crosses this grand strait, its persistence\r\nwithout sign of failure during more than a quarter of a century, its\r\nimportance as a connecting link between England and Ireland, and the\r\nresult of this early effort to conquer formidable physical difficulties,\r\nfill the beholder with admiration and delight, and do lasting honor to\r\nMr. Telford, the distinguished architect.\r\n\r\n\r\n           GREAT RAILWAY SUSPENSION BRIDGE AT NIAGARA FALLS.\r\n\r\nWe have before, on page 265, given some account of this vast structure\r\nas it was, when so far completed as to be used for ordinary passage. But\r\nwe advert to it again here, both because it has since had added to it\r\nthe superstructure for railway-trains, and also that we may bring in\r\ncomparison, the first suspension bridge ever attempted, (an account of\r\nwhich has been given,) and one of the last and largest ever undertaken.\r\nThe first train of cars passed over this bridge on the ninth of March,\r\n1855, from the Canada to the American shore, the engine and tender being\r\ncrowded with people, having the English and American colors flying,\r\nwhile bands of music were playing alternately the national airs of Great\r\nBritain and of the United States. The opening of this mighty and\r\nmagnificent structure, well worthy of being classed with the world’s\r\nwonders, really forms an epoch in the history of the world. It unites\r\nwith strong iron bands two countries, to the intelligence and enterprise\r\nof whose inhabitants the bridge owes its existence, and stands a fitting\r\nmonument. Its strength can never be fully tested; the weight of a fully\r\nladen train being but a trifle in comparison to its capacity. A train of\r\neight cars, filled with passengers, two baggage-cars, locomotive and\r\ntender, weigh but about one hundred and thirty tuns; this being only\r\none-sixtieth of its immense capacity. The railway portion of the bridge\r\nis leased to and controlled by the Great Western railway company, and\r\nhas laid upon it tracks of three different gauges, _viz._, the New York\r\nCentral, four feet and eight and a half inches; the Elmira and Niagara\r\nFalls, six feet; and the Great Western, five feet and six inches, thus\r\naffording facilities for the transit of both passengers and freight,\r\nwithout change of cars. The following statistics will give some idea of\r\nthis immense structure and its capacity.\r\n\r\n  Length of span from center to center of towers,         822 feet.\r\n  Hight of tower above rock on the American side,          88 feet.\r\n  Hight of tower above rock on the Canada side,            78 feet.\r\n  Hight of tower above rock on the floor of railway,       60 feet.\r\n  Number of wire cables,                                    4\r\n  Diameter of each cable,                                  10 inch.\r\n  Number of No. 9 wires on each cable,                  3,659\r\n  Ultimate aggregate strength of cables,               12,409 tuns.\r\n  Weight of superstructure,                               750 tuns.\r\n  Weight of superstructure and maximum loads,           1,250 tuns.\r\n  Maximum weight the cable and stays will support,      7,200 tuns.\r\n  Hight of track above water,                             234 feet.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         OTHER IMMENSE BRIDGES.\r\n\r\nAt Peru, in Illinois, is the great bridge of the Illinois Central\r\nrailroad, which is thirty-five hundred feet, or nearly two-thirds of a\r\nmile long. This is perhaps the greatest work of the kind in all the\r\nwestern states. It reaches from bluff to bluff, is seventy-five feet in\r\nhight, and contains over one million feet of lumber, beside immense\r\nquantities of iron and stone. The top is covered with tin, and made\r\nwater-tight; the trains of cars are to run on the top of all; and\r\nbeneath them, and between the frames, pass the roads for wagons; while\r\nunderneath all are the river and canal. An ornamental railing is placed\r\non each side of the track.\r\n\r\nAnother large bridge, on the suspension principle, is that over the\r\nMississippi, near St. Anthony and Minnesopolis, in Minnesota. The work\r\nconsists of a wire suspension bridge, of one span of six hundred and\r\nthirty feet, having seventeen feet of roadway, connecting the western\r\nbank of the Mississippi river with Nicollet island, about one hundred\r\nyards above the first break of its waters into rapids above the falls.\r\n\r\nBut perhaps the largest bridge ever built, will be, when completed, that\r\nnow erecting over the St. Lawrence, called the Victoria (railroad)\r\nbridge, which is to be an immense iron tube, ten thousand, two hundred\r\nand eighty-four feet, or nearly two miles long. It is to be set on\r\ntwenty-four piers, from two hundred and twenty to three hundred feet\r\napart. At the highest point it will be some sixty feet from the water;\r\nand it is estimated that it will take at least five years to finish it.\r\nThese are some of the largest bridges, (in addition to those already\r\nparticularly mentioned,) ever erected in any part of the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       THE HIGH BRIDGE AT HARLEM.\r\n\r\nThe High bridge at Harlem, a view of which is given in the cut below,\r\nforms part of the immense works erected to bring the water of the Croton\r\nriver into the city of New York. The dam at the river, which is seventy\r\nfeet wide at the bottom, seven feet wide at the top, and two hundred and\r\nfifty feet long and forty feet high, creates a pond five miles long,\r\ncovering a surface of four hundred acres, and containing five hundred\r\nmillion gallons of water. From this the aqueduct proceeds, sometimes\r\ntunneling through solid rocks, crossing valleys by embankments, and\r\nbrooks by culverts, till it reaches the Harlem river, a distance of\r\nthirty-three miles. It is built of stone, brick and cement, arched over\r\nand under, and is made large enough to discharge sixty millions of\r\ngallons every twenty-four hours. It crosses the Harlem river on a\r\nmagnificent bridge of stone, fourteen hundred and fifty feet long,\r\nhaving fourteen piers, eight of them bearing arches of eighty feet span,\r\nand seven others of fifty feet span, one hundred and fourteen feet above\r\ntide-water at the top. The aqueduct then passes on to a first, or\r\nreceiving reservoir, which covers thirty-five acres and will hold one\r\nhundred and fifty million gallons, and thence to the second, or\r\ndistributing reservoir, which holds twenty million gallons, whence it is\r\ndistributed by pipes through the city. The entire cost of the work has\r\nbeen fifteen million dollars.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE HIGH BRIDGE AT HARLEM.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                         THE BOSTON RESERVOIR.\r\n\r\nThe mention of the High bridge at Harlem, and its connection with the\r\naqueduct which brings the Croton water to the city of New York, suggests\r\nsome notice of the aqueduct by which water is brought to the city of\r\nBoston, Massachusetts. So early as 1795, an association was formed in\r\nBoston for supplying the inhabitants with pure water; and for years it\r\nwas brought from Jamaica pond, in Roxbury, some four miles distant, in\r\nlogs which were bored for the purpose. These logs were capable of\r\nsupplying some fifty thousand gallons daily, which could be raised to\r\nthe hight of forty-nine feet above tide-water. This supply, however, was\r\nsoon found inadequate to the wants of the city, though in 1845, some\r\nfifteen miles of pipes had been laid, and some three thousand houses\r\nwere regularly supplied with water. A plan was therefore formed in 1845,\r\nto supply the city with water from Lake Cochituate, or Long pond, as it\r\nwas formerly called, about twenty miles west of Boston. This lake covers\r\na surface of some six hundred and fifty acres, is seventy feet deep, and\r\ndrains the springs, it is supposed, of some eleven thousand acres. Its\r\nelevation is one hundred and twenty-four feet above spring-tide, so that\r\nthe descent is such as to make the conveyance of water to the city both\r\neasy and sure. The water is carried in a brick conduit or tunnel, high\r\nenough for a man to walk upright in, as far as the receiving reservoir\r\nin Brookline, and from there is taken in thirty and thirty-six inch\r\npipes to the distributing reservoir on Beacon hill, in Boston. It is\r\nthis reservoir, a view of which is given in the cut beyond, from which\r\nthe water is distributed in pipes throughout the city. The average daily\r\nsupply of water needed for the present population of Boston, is about\r\nfive million gallons. The water-works are capable of supplying twenty\r\nmillion gallons daily; and the Cochituate lake is capable, (by laying\r\ndown another main pipe,) of supplying forty million gallons daily. The\r\nsupply of the lake is fully equal to the wants of half a million of\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE BOSTON RESERVOIR.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                   AQUEDUCT AT THE PEAT FOREST CANAL.\r\n\r\nThis aqueduct forms part of the Peat Forest canal, which is a branch of\r\none of the canals extending out from Manchester in England. The latter\r\ncity is the great center of the cotton manufacture for England, and\r\nperhaps the principal manufacturing town in the world. Before the\r\ninvention of what was called the _spinning-frame_, in 1767, the entire\r\nimports of cotton into Great Britain did not amount to four million\r\npounds a year, and the value of exported cotton goods was not over one\r\nmillion dollars. But so rapid has been the improvement of machinery, and\r\nthe increase of manufactures, that in 1840 the imports of cotton\r\namounted to the prodigious quantity of nearly six hundred million\r\npounds, of which nearly five hundred million were manufactured. And in\r\n1854, these imports amounted to nearly nine hundred million pounds, of\r\nwhich about the same proportion was manufactured as in 1840. Of this\r\nimmense manufacture, Manchester is the center; and to this may be added\r\nvarious other manufactures, as in silks, worsteds, machinery, &c., &c.,\r\n&c. As a consequence of this immense business, seeking, of course,\r\noutlets to market, Manchester has become a great center of internal\r\nnavigation. So early as 1761, the Duke of Bridgewater’s canal was\r\nconstructed; and this was soon followed by the Bury and Bolton canal, in\r\n1791; by that to Ashton and Oldham, in 1792; and by that to Rochdale, in\r\n1794. And these, again, are connected with other canals in such a manner\r\nas to establish an easy communication with the eastern, central and\r\nsouthern counties, including the ports of Hull, London and Bristol, as\r\nwell as Liverpool, which, of all others, is _the_ port of Manchester. It\r\nis on one of these side canals that the aqueduct, a view of which is\r\ngiven in the cut above, is located; or rather, it forms part of the\r\ncanal itself. It is not so much to be noted for its greatness or\r\nexpensiveness, as for the fact that it was among some of the earliest\r\nstructures of this kind, which have since become common wherever canal\r\nnavigation is known.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AQUEDUCT ON THE PEAT FOREST CANAL.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                           THE THAMES TUNNEL.\r\n\r\nA _tunnel_, in engineering, is a subterranean passage cut through a\r\nhill, or under a river, for the purpose of carrying a canal, road, or\r\nrailway, &c. One of the most remarkable works of this kind, ever\r\nexecuted, is the tunnel under the river Thames, planned by Mr. Brunel,\r\nand successfully executed under his direction. Two previous attempts had\r\nbeen made to carry a tunnel under the river; one in 1799, and the other\r\nin 1804; but both were unsuccessful. In 1824, however, an act of\r\nparliament, authorizing operations on the plan of Mr. Brunel, was\r\nobtained; and shortly after the work was commenced. A short account of\r\nthe progress of the work will probably be the best mode of conveying a\r\nnotion of the nature and difficulty of tunneling in general.\r\n\r\nMr. Brunel began his operations by making preparations for a shaft fifty\r\nfeet in diameter, which he commenced one hundred and fifty feet from the\r\nriver on the Surrey side; this he effected by constructing on the\r\nsurface of the ground a substantial brick cylinder of that diameter,\r\nforty-two feet in hight and three feet in thickness. Over this he set up\r\na steam-engine, necessary for pumping out the water, and for raising the\r\nearth to be taken from within the cylinder, and then proceeded to sink\r\nit bodily into the earth. By this means he succeeded in passing through\r\na bed of sand and gravel twenty-six feet deep, constituting, in part, a\r\nquicksand, and in which the drift-makers of the former undertaking had\r\nbeen compelled to suspend their work. The cylinder having been sunk to\r\nthe depth of sixty-five feet, the horizontal excavation was commenced at\r\nthe depth of sixty-three feet; and in order to have sufficient thickness\r\nof ground to pass safely under the deep part of the river, the\r\nexcavation was made to descend two feet and three inches in every\r\nhundred feet. This excavation is thirty feet wide, and twenty-two and a\r\nhalf feet high, and the process of making it may briefly be described as\r\nfollows.\r\n\r\nIt was accomplished by means of a powerful apparatus of iron, called a\r\n_shield_, and which consisted of twelve large frames, standing close to\r\neach other, like so many volumes on the shelf of a book-case, these\r\nframes being twenty-two feet in hight, and about three feet in width.\r\nThey were divided into three stages or stories, thus presenting\r\nthirty-six cells or chambers for the miners. The front of each one of\r\nthese cells was protected by narrow boards, technically called\r\npolling-boards, each of which was separately held in its place by an\r\napparatus constructed for the purpose. The miner commenced by removing\r\nthe upper polling-board in his division of the shield, thus exposing a\r\nsmall portion of earth; into this earth he made an excavation of six\r\ninches in depth, throwing the earth behind him, from whence it was\r\nremoved to the mouth of the tunnel, and from thence raised by steam to\r\nthe surface of the ground. He then replaced the polling-board, causing\r\nit to press against the face of the newly excavated earth, and thus\r\nadvancing it six inches beyond the other polling-boards of his division.\r\nThen successively taking down the remaining boards, excavating the earth\r\nsix inches behind them, and replacing the boards six inches further in\r\nthan before, he very soon had advanced that distance over the whole\r\nlength of his division. All the other miners in the thirty-six cells\r\nhaving done the same, the framework was moved forward, and six inches\r\nmore of earth removed. It was in this way, by these slow degrees, that\r\nthe work was finally completed. As the frame-work advanced, it was\r\nclosely followed by a solid mass of brick-work, inclosing two arched\r\npassages. These two passages were separated by a solid wall, three and a\r\nhalf feet at the top and four at the bottom. Other arches, however, were\r\nformed in this wall, for the purpose of opening a communication between\r\none tunnel and the other. The whole of the brick-work is laid in Roman\r\ncement, and each archway is finished with a lining of cement, a\r\ncarriage-road, and a narrow foot-path adjoining the central wall.\r\n\r\nThis immense enterprise was not finally completed without serious delay\r\nand apparently insurmountable obstacles. The works were thrice\r\ninterrupted: in 1826, by the breaking off of the clay, leaving the\r\nshield exposed to the influx of the land-water for six weeks; also in\r\nMay, 1827, and in January, 1828, when the river broke in and filled the\r\ntunnel. This was quickly remedied, however, by filling the holes or\r\nchasms with strong bags of clay; the structure, on clearing the tunnel\r\nof the water, being found in a most satisfactory state. Some time later,\r\nthe works were suspended for seven years, owing to the want of funds.\r\nParliament, however, after repeated applications, granted an advance for\r\ntheir completion, and the works were resumed and continued, till they\r\nwere brought to a successful termination. The cost of the tunnel, with\r\nthe approaches on both sides of the river, was about three million and a\r\nhalf dollars; much less than the cost of the modern metropolitan bridges\r\nwhich span the Thames between Surrey and Middlesex.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           RAILROAD TUNNELS.\r\n\r\nThe establishment of railroad communication has given rise, both in this\r\ncountry and Europe, to some stupendous undertakings in the way of\r\ntunneling; one or two of which are worthy of notice as illustrating the\r\nnature and extent of this kind of work. And the first of these which we\r\nshall mention, and one of the most remarkable, is the Box tunnel on the\r\nGreat Western railway in England. This tunnel pierces what is called Box\r\nhill, between Chippenham and Bath, part of which is four hundred feet\r\nabove the level of the track. It is ninety-six hundred and eighty feet\r\nlong, thirty-nine feet high, and thirty-five wide to the outside of the\r\nbrick-work. The shafts for making and ventilating it, are thirteen in\r\nnumber, and vary in depth from eighty to three hundred and six feet. The\r\nexcavation amounted to four hundred and fourteen thousand cubic yards;\r\nand the brick-work and masonry, to more than fifty-four thousand cubic\r\nyards. The number of bricks used, was thirty million. A tun of gunpowder\r\nand a tun of candles were consumed every week for two years and a half;\r\nand eleven hundred men and two hundred and fifty horses were kept\r\nconstantly employed for all that time. For a considerable distance the\r\ntunnel passes through freestone rock, from the fissures of which there\r\nwas, at times, an immense influx of water, by which on one occasion the\r\nworks were interrupted for a period of nine months. On another occasion\r\nafter an irruption, water was for some time discharged by the engine at\r\nthe rate of thirty-two thousand hogsheads a day. This tunnel is on an\r\ninclined plane of one in a hundred. There are several other tunnels of\r\ngreat extent in England, such as the Kilsby tunnel, on the London and\r\nBirmingham road, which is over seven thousand feet long; and the tunnel\r\nfrom Wapping to Edge hill, on the Liverpool and Manchester road, which\r\nis over six thousand feet long, and quite a number of others of five\r\nthousand, four thousand, three thousand feet long, &c. One of these\r\nremarkable tunnels, is that on the South-eastern or Dover railway, a\r\nview of which is given in the cut on the following page, which passes\r\nthrough what is called Shakspeare’s cliff, at Dover, (though _the_ cliff\r\nto which the poet alluded has been undermined and thrown down, and the\r\nname is now given to another part of the same range,) on the north side\r\nof the British channel. This cliff is a high bluff of chalk, on the west\r\nof the town, the white appearance of which gave the name of _Albion_\r\n(white) to England. There are two openings in the tunnel; and through\r\nthese the whizzing locomotives fly along the dizzy precipice, as if it\r\nwere an ordinary highway. There is, also, a _second_ tunnel in the same\r\ncliff. This last is called the Abbot’s-cliff tunnel, and is about a mile\r\nin length, coming out on the face of the rock about sixty feet above the\r\nsea. The track passes along the front of the rampart for about a mile,\r\nand then enters the Shakspeare tunnel, which is also about a mile in\r\nlength. Thence, again, it issues on the face of the cliff, and proceeds\r\nto the station at Dover.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TUNNEL IN SHAKSPEARE’S CLIFF.]\r\n\r\nIn the United States there are quite a number of railroad tunnels of\r\ngreat extent. One of these is the Blue Ridge tunnel, in Virginia, the\r\nlength of which, when completed, will be forty-two hundred and sixty\r\nfeet, of which more than half is already (1855) finished. The work has\r\nbeen commenced on each side of the mountain, and is progressing at the\r\nrate of about fifty feet a month, at which rate of progress it would\r\ntake about three years to complete it.\r\n\r\nBut probably the most gigantic work ever proposed in the way of\r\ntunneling, is the Hoosic tunnel, on the line of the Troy and Greenfield\r\nrailroad, by which it is designed to shorten the passage from the former\r\nplace to Boston. This immense tunnel it is proposed to carry through the\r\nsolid rock of the mountain for a distance of some four miles, and to\r\nmake it wide enough for a double track for the railroad; the expense of\r\ndoing which is variously estimated, at from four million to six million\r\ndollars. By the ordinary method of drilling and blasting, it would take\r\nso long a time, and require so large an expenditure, that all idea of\r\nthus accomplishing the work has long since been given up, if, indeed, it\r\nwas ever entertained. And the plan is, by immense boring machines,\r\nconstructed for the purpose, to make grooves round large masses of the\r\nrock, and when these latter are broken up by blasting, to remove them\r\npiece by piece. Several such machines have been invented and constructed\r\nwith reference to this very work, and one or two of these have been\r\nfound successful in practice, though the immense strain caused by the\r\nboring is such as to require corresponding strength in the borer. To\r\ngive the necessary ventilation, and now and then light to the tunnel,\r\nboth when in the course of construction, and especially when finished\r\nand in use, it is proposed at proper intervals to sink dry wells, or\r\nopenings from the top of the mountain, down to the tunnel itself; so\r\nthat the constant stream of air entering the mouth of the latter, at\r\neither end, may be always and steadily passing up through these chimneys\r\nor ventilators, thus carrying off the smoke of the engines, or any\r\nimpurities of the otherwise stagnant air. The work, when completed, if\r\nit ever is, will be a monument of enterprise and perseverance, unrivaled\r\nin the history of tunneling in this or any other country of the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        THE COLOSSUS AT RHODES.\r\n\r\nThis was a celebrated brazen image of Apollo, of the enormous hight of\r\none hundred and five Grecian, or one hundred and twenty-five English\r\nfeet, placed at the entrance of one of the harbors of the city of\r\nRhodes, (anciently Rhodus,) which is about twenty miles from the coast\r\nof Lycia and Caria, in the Mediterranean sea. The island of Rhodes is\r\nabout one hundred and twenty miles in circumference, and was early\r\noccupied by a colony of Greeks from Crete and Thessaly, who in time\r\nbecame both wealthy and powerful. Their capital city was on the east of\r\nthe island; it was built in the form of an amphitheater, and had\r\nnumerous splendid buildings, among which was a temple to Apollo. Having\r\nfor a time submitted to the power of Alexander the Great, they afterward\r\nrefused to assist Antigonus in his war with Egypt, when he sent his son\r\nDemetrius against them, with an immense fleet and army. They, however,\r\nbeing aided by Ptolemy, king of Egypt, were enabled to repulse his\r\nforces and to oblige him to agree to a peace. And he being thus\r\nreconciled to them, in admiration of the courage they had displayed,\r\npresented to them all the engines he had employed in the attack, by the\r\nsale of which, for three hundred talents, they raised the famous\r\ncolossus, a view of which is given in the cut.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE COLOSSUS OF RHODES.]\r\n\r\nThis immense statue, as already said, was of brass, and was erected in\r\nhonor of Apollo, the tutelary god of the island, in acknowledgment of\r\nthe protection he was supposed to have rendered the Rhodians in their\r\nrecent conflict. It was the workmanship of Chares, (a pupil of Lysippus,\r\na celebrated sculptor and statuary of Greece,) who, with an assistant,\r\nwas engaged in the work for more than twelve years. The hight of the\r\nstatue, as already said, was one hundred and twenty-five feet; its thumb\r\nwas so large that few people could grasp it; and the fingers were each\r\nlarger than the bodies of statues of ordinary size. It was hollow, and\r\nto counterbalance the weight, and render it steady on its feet, its legs\r\nwere lined with heavy masonry; and within them, were winding staircases\r\nleading to the top of the statue, from which one could easily see Syria,\r\nand the ships sailing to Egypt. It is supposed to have stood, with\r\ndistended legs, on the two moles which formed the entrance of the\r\nharbor; but as the city had two harbors, one twenty, and the other fifty\r\nfeet wide at the entrance, it has been supposed to have been at the\r\nnarrowest. It bore a light, or lantern, so as to serve as a light-house;\r\nbut whether on the head, or in one of the hands, as represented in the\r\ncut, is not certainly known. The statue was erected B. C. 300, and after\r\nhaving stood about sixty years, was thrown down by an earthquake. After\r\nits fall, the Rhodians solicited help from the kings of Macedonia and\r\nEgypt, and in other countries, to enable them to restore it; and so\r\ngreat was the commercial importance of Rhodes, that their appeal was\r\npromptly met by magnificent gifts; but the oracle at Delphos forbade\r\nthem again to raise the colossus. The statue then remained in ruins for\r\nthe space of eight hundred and ninety-four years, when, in the year 672\r\nA. D., it was sold by the Saracens, who were then masters of the island,\r\nto a Jewish merchant of Edessa, who loaded nine hundred camels with the\r\nmetal which had composed it, and which, estimated at eight hundred\r\npounds for each camel-load, would have amounted to seven hundred and\r\ntwenty thousand pounds’ weight.\r\n\r\nThe character of Rhodian art was a mixed Græco-Asiatic style, which\r\nseems to have delighted in executing gigantic and imposing conceptions;\r\nfor beside this celebrated colossus, (which was one of the seven wonders\r\nof the ancient world,) there were three thousand other statues adorning\r\nthe city; and of these, about one hundred were on such a scale of size\r\nand magnificence, that the presence of any one of them would have been\r\nthought sufficient to dignify almost any other spot. The architecture of\r\nRhodes was of the most stately character: the plan of the city was by\r\nthe same architect who built the Piræus at Athens; and all was designed\r\nwith such symmetry, that Aristides remarks, “It is as if it had been one\r\nhouse.” The streets were wide, and of unbroken length; and the\r\nfortifications, strengthened at intervals with lofty towers, did not\r\nappear, as in other cities, detached from the buildings which they\r\ninclosed, but by their boldness, and decision of outline, hightened the\r\nunity and conception of the groups of architecture within. The temples\r\nwere decorated with paintings, by Protogenes, Zeuxis, and other\r\ncelebrated artists of the school of Rhodes; and of one of these\r\npictures, it is said, that when taken to Rome, it was the object of\r\nuniversal admiration. The island, after passing through various\r\nfortunes, has, for a long time, been part of the Turkish empire.\r\n\r\n\r\n              -------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n                         MISCELLANEOUS WONDERS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  ------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving dwelt so long on the WONDERS OF NATURE, and the WONDERS OF ART,\r\nboth ancient and modern, we pass to some of the wonders and curiosities\r\nof the world of a miscellaneous nature. Some things are wonders only\r\nthrough their associations, as is the case with many of the localities\r\nof Palestine, for example, where the Saviour lived and walked, and\r\nwrought his miracles of power and mercy. Some are wonders as exhibiting\r\nthe inventive powers of man, or the progress of our age as compared with\r\nanother; some as exhibiting the singularities of nature; and some as\r\ncombining the wonders both of science and art. The steamboat, the\r\nprinting-press, the air-balloon, the residence of Washington, the hut of\r\nthe Kamtschatkadale, the spot where the “Pilgrim Fathers” landed, the\r\ntelegraph, the diving-bell or armor, the prairie on fire, the nest of\r\nthe African tailor-bird, each of these, and of a multitude of other\r\nthings that might be enumerated, is, in some way, or for some reason,\r\nassociated to our minds with what is more or less wonderful, while still\r\nit may not be strictly a wonder either of nature or of art. Some of\r\nthese we propose now to notice, interspersing them at intervals with\r\nsome of the more miscellaneous wonders of nature, or art, or both, so as\r\nto give variety to the pages that follow. And the first of this class of\r\nwonders we will notice, is,\r\n\r\n\r\n                          YOULE’S SHOT-TOWER.\r\n\r\nThis edifice, which is one of the best of its class, is situated at the\r\nfoot of Fifty-fourth street, on the East river, in the city of New York.\r\nIt is hexagonal in form, and rises to the hight of one hundred and\r\nseventy-five feet; being sixty feet in diameter at the base, and\r\ngradually growing smaller as it rises toward the top. It forms a most\r\nstriking object of interest; and is remarked by the multitudes who pass\r\nby it going up and down the sound, to and from New York. When we\r\nconsider the small size of the article to the manufacture of which this\r\nlofty structure is devoted, the means appear greatly out of proportion\r\nwith the result. Formerly in casting shot, the apparatus was merely a\r\nplate of copper, in the hollow of which were punched a number of holes.\r\nThis was placed a few feet above a kettle of water, into which the\r\nmelted lead descended, after passing through the holes in the plate. But\r\nin falling so short a distance, and being so suddenly cooled and\r\nhardened, the shot did not acquire a perfectly globular form, a\r\ndesideratum which is now attained by means of shot-towers. In the tower\r\nof Mr. McCullough, the largest shot falls from the summit of the tower\r\nto the bottom of a well twenty-five feet below the surface of the earth,\r\nmaking the descent one hundred and seventy-five feet. The size of the\r\nshot is determined by the size of the holes through which it passes. The\r\nfurnaces for melting the lead are situated near the top of the tower;\r\nthree or four tuns of shot are manufactured per day. This method of\r\ncasting shot was invented by Mr. Watt, the celebrated engineer, in\r\nconsequence, it is said, of a dream. He tried the experiment from the\r\ntower of the church of St. Mary, Radcliffe, and finding it very\r\nsuccessful, obtained a patent, which he afterward sold for ten thousand\r\npounds. There are now several shot-towers in the vicinity of London, and\r\ndifferent parts of the world; but none more worthy of notice than the\r\none of which we are now speaking. An iron staircase ascends from the\r\nbase to the summit of the tower. Arsenic is mingled with the lead in\r\nproportion of forty pounds to one tun. In casting, the metal is poured\r\nthrough a tube, but descends through the open space of the tower in a\r\ncontinual stream of silvery drops. As the weight of the lead prevents it\r\nfrom scattering or being blown about like water-drops, the workmen pass\r\nto and fro, without danger, close by this fiery cascade. The shot is of\r\ndifferent sizes, from number one, swan shot, to number twelve, dust\r\nshot. Mr. James McCullough has brought the art of the manufacture of the\r\nshot to perfection. Certain portions of his factory are kept entirely\r\nsecret; and the shot manufactured in New York are not surpassed in the\r\nworld. The cause of most of the imperfections in the manufacture of lead\r\nshot, is the too rapid cooling of the spherules by their being dropped\r\ntoo hot into the water, whereby their surfaces form a solid crust, while\r\nthe interior remains fluid, and in its subsequent concretion shrinks so\r\nas to produce the irregularities of the shot. The patent shot-towers\r\noriginally constructed in England, obviate this evil, by exposing the\r\nfused spherules, after they pass through the cullender, to a large body\r\nof air during their descent into the water-tub placed on the ground. The\r\ngreatest erection of this kind is probably at Villach, in Carinthia,\r\nbeing two hundred and forty Vienna, or two hundred and forty-nine\r\nEnglish feet high. The following is the process. Melt a tun of soft\r\nlead, and sprinkle round the sides of the iron pot about two shovelfuls\r\nof wood ashes, taking care to leave the center clear. Then put into the\r\nmiddle about forty pounds of arsenic, to form a rich alloy with the\r\nlead. Cover the pot with an iron lid, and lute the joints quickly with\r\nloam or mortar, to confine the arsenical vapors, keeping up a moderate\r\nfire to maintain the mixture fluid for three or four hours; after which,\r\nskim carefully, and run the alloy into ingots or pigs. The composition\r\nthus made is in proportion of one pig to one thousand pounds of melted\r\nlead. Two or three tons are usually melted at once in large\r\nestablishments. A crust of oxyd of a white spongy nature, sometimes\r\ncalled cream by the workmen, covers the surface of the lead, which is of\r\nuse to coat over the bottom of the cullender. The cullenders are hollow\r\nhemispheres of sheet-iron, about ten inches in diameter, perforated with\r\nholes perfectly round and free from burs. These must be of a uniform\r\nsize in each cullender; but, of course, a series of different\r\ncullenders, with sorted holes for every different size of lead shot,\r\nmust be prepared. The operation is always carried on with three\r\ncullenders at a time, which are supported upon projecting grates of a\r\nkind of chafing-dish made of sheet-iron, somewhat like a triangle. This\r\nchafing-dish should be placed immediately above the fall; while at the\r\nbottom there must be a tub half-filled with water, for receiving the\r\ngranulated lead. The cullenders are not in contact, but must be parted\r\nby burning charcoal, in order to keep the lead constantly at the proper\r\ntemperature, and to prevent its solidifying in the filter. The hight\r\nfrom which the particles should be let fall, varies likewise with the\r\nsize of the shot; as the congelation is the more rapid, the smaller they\r\nare. The workman then puts the filter stuff into the cullender, pressing\r\nit well against the sides; he next gently pours lead into it with an\r\niron ladle. The center of the cullender being less hot, affords larger\r\nshot than the sides. Occasionally, also, the three cullenders employed\r\ntogether, may have holes of different sizes; the shot will then be of\r\ndifferent magnitudes. These are separated by square sieves of different\r\nfineness, and after passing through other minute processes, are ready\r\nfor sale and use.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         THE EMPEROR FOUNTAIN.\r\n\r\nThis splendid fountain, a view of which is given in the cut beyond, is\r\none of the most remarkable in the world, and in commemoration of a visit\r\npaid to it in 1844, by the emperor of Russia, it was called the Emperor\r\nfountain, though since the outbreak of the war between Great Britain and\r\nRussia, the name is said to have been changed to that of the Victoria\r\nfountain. It is situated in Chatsworth, one of the most luxurious seats\r\nof the English nobility; famous for its exceeding beauty and its costly\r\nembellishments. Its walks, lawns, parterres, mimic Alpine scenery,\r\nconservatories, gardens, cascades, halls, pictures, and sculpture, and\r\nmusic, and fountains, have all been constructed and arranged with\r\nconsummate taste and with lavish expense. A month would scarcely suffice\r\nto visit all that is worthy of observation in this wonderful place, and\r\nperhaps few sights could produce a deeper impression of the wealth\r\npossessed by the English aristocracy. We have from this munificent\r\nstorehouse selected a single object to be delineated by the pencil. The\r\nEmperor fountain is fed by immense artificial reservoirs on the hills\r\nabove Chatsworth, covering eight acres of ground, into which various\r\nsprings and streams have been diverted. Our American ideas of a fountain\r\nare usually limited to a beautiful jet of water forced twenty or thirty\r\nfeet in hight; hence it is with amazement, if not incredulity, that we\r\nhear of the fountain of Chatsworth, which throws its jet to the hight of\r\ntwo hundred and sixty-seven feet! Such is the velocity with which the\r\nwater is ejected, that it is calculated to escape at the rate of one\r\nhundred miles a minute!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE EMPEROR FOUNTAIN.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                THE UNITED STATES MINT IN PHILADELPHIA.\r\n\r\nThe United States mint was founded in 1790; and the business of coining\r\ncommenced in 1793, in the building now occupied by the Apprentice’s\r\nlibrary. In 1830, it was removed to the fine building it now occupies,\r\non Chestnut street, above Olive street. The edifice is of white marble;\r\nand the north front, opposite to Penn square, is one hundred and twenty\r\nfeet long, with a portico of sixty feet long, having six Ionic columns;\r\nwhile the south front, on Chestnut street, has a similar portico. Since\r\nthe enormous influx of gold from California, the United States mint has\r\nbecome an object of more than common interest and attention; and the\r\nplace is usually filled with visitors, watching the various processes\r\nthe metal goes through before it comes out in finished coin. The\r\nmachinery and apparatus by which these are accomplished, are of the most\r\ncomplete and perfect character. The rooms in which the smelting,\r\nrefining, and alloying are done, are spacious apartments in which a\r\nlarge number of workmen are employed. Heaps of the rich ores are to be\r\nseen lying around, just as they were extracted from the mines, or\r\ngathered in dust from the sands of the mountain-streams of California.\r\nBars of the pure metal, of thousands of dollars’ value, are passing\r\nthrough hands, which like those of the fabled Midas, seem to turn all\r\nthey touch into gold. The heat of this place is very great; the fires\r\nglow with the intensity of those in a foundery; the men, in appearance,\r\nresemble the workmen in a smithy; and there is a suffocating sensation\r\nof hot air, steam, and perspiration, penetrating the atmosphere, which\r\nis anything but pleasant to experience, especially when one is\r\npalpitating under the heat of a summer temperature, without the\r\nfreshness of the open air to modify and alleviate it. Crucibles are\r\nhandled with iron tongs, and cotton or woolen mittens; and the metal is\r\nshaped into bars, and then reduced to the requisite fineness. All this\r\ntakes place in one apartment.\r\n\r\nIn another room, is seen a most beautiful steam-engine, which drives all\r\nthe rolling and stamping machinery. It is of one hundred horse-power,\r\nand works the rolling machinery, the draw-benches, and the cutting\r\npresses. It is called a steeple-engine, and has two cylinders; its\r\nboilers are forty feet long, and forty inches in diameter; and the steam\r\nfrom them also moves a ten horse, and a five horse engine, in the\r\nseparating and cleaning apartments. This main engine is of the most\r\nelegant workmanship, polished like a piece of cutlery, and works with\r\nthe most admirable precision and regularity, without the least\r\nperceptible jar, and with scarcely a noise. From this room, the visitor\r\nwalks into that where the rolling machines are at work, turning out the\r\nmetal to the proper degree of thickness which each particular kind of\r\ncoin requires. The metal is cast into ingots fourteen inches long, and\r\nabout five-eighths of an inch thick; and these are rolled to very near\r\nthe proper thickness, when they are passed through the draw-benches to\r\nequalize them. The strips are then cut at the presses, which is done at\r\nthe rate of about two hundred to two hundred and sixty per minute. There\r\nare fourteen men employed in this room, two at each pair of rolls. The\r\npieces, as thus cut, then pass to the adjusting room, where each piece\r\nis weighed separately, and if too heavy, filed down, or if too light, or\r\nany way imperfect, thrown back to be remelted. There are fifty-four\r\nfemales employed in this room. The pieces are next taken to the milling\r\nand coining room, where from two hundred to four hundred are milled in a\r\nminute, according to their size. In another apartment, the coins are cut\r\nwith a punch to the desired size, and then stamped. For this purpose\r\nthey are placed, by a person seated at the machine, in a perpendicular\r\ntube, down which they descend, one at a time, being seized as they drop\r\nby a part of the machinery, which pushes the coin under the stamp,\r\nwhence it falls beneath the machine into a glass-covered box. This part\r\nof the process used formerly to be performed by a press which required\r\neight men to work its lever and screw; but now the process requires\r\nscarcely any manual labor except handling the various pieces of coin.\r\nThe rapidity with which the pieces are executed, is surprising; being at\r\nthe rate of from seventy-five to two hundred per minute. Cents, dimes,\r\ndollars, eagles and double-eagles are turned out with equal facility,\r\nthe process being the same in all. Some idea of the extensiveness of\r\nthese operations may be had, when it is stated, that, in a single month,\r\nlately, nearly three million pieces of gold, silver and copper were\r\ncoined, and that over four million dollars in value are coined every\r\nmonth.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the other attractions of the mint, there is a most\r\nextensive cabinet of coins, ancient and modern, of various nations,\r\nwhich is one of the greatest of curiosities to be found, probably, in\r\nany part of the world. Here, too, are exhibited specimens of all the\r\nexisting or past coins of the mint itself, and models or specimens of\r\nany intended coins. The officers and attendants of the mint are polite\r\nand attentive to all visitors, and endeavor to make their visit one of\r\ninstruction as well as amusement; and any one, by calling at appointed\r\nhours, can go through the various apartments of the building, and see\r\nthe various processes which have thus been described.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            THE AIR BALLOON.\r\n\r\nFrom the earliest ages, the notion of flying in the air, either by wings\r\nor by supernatural agency, seems to have been in the minds of at least\r\nsome of mankind; but the idea of the _balloon_, consisting of an\r\nenvelope containing something light enough to make it rise and float in\r\ncommon air, is comparatively of much later date. It is said that the\r\nfirst definite notion of the balloon originated with a Jesuit, by the\r\nname of Francis Lana, who in 1670 conceived the idea of raising metal\r\nballs in the atmosphere, which had previously been exhausted of air, but\r\nwhich should be at the same time so thin, as to weigh less than their\r\nbulk of air. The experiment, however, he never tried, as, in his age, it\r\nwas not believed that God would allow an invention to succeed, by means\r\nof which civil government could so easily be disturbed. Later\r\nexperiments have proved that strength to resist the external air is\r\nincompatible with the necessary degree of thinness in the material. From\r\nthis period, one hundred years elapsed, before the idea of raising a\r\nbody in the air, by means of its being lighter than the air whose space\r\nit occupies, was pursued any further. In 1782, an attempt was made to\r\nraise bodies filled with hydrogen gas, a substance which, as is well\r\nknown, is lighter than atmospheric air. The experimenter succeeded,\r\nhowever, in raising nothing heavier than a soap-bubble. In the same\r\nyear, the brothers Montgolfier, paper-makers at Lyons, attempted to\r\nraise a paper balloon by means of hydrogen gas. Being unsuccessful in\r\nthis, they conceived the idea of applying fire underneath a large\r\nballoon of paper built upon a framework of wood, and containing a\r\nreceptacle for fire in the place where, in modern balloons, the car is\r\nsuspended. This experiment being so far successful as to show the\r\ncorrectness of the principle, they next made a balloon of linen cloth,\r\nand kindled under it a fire made and fed by bundles of chopped straw,\r\napparently with the impression that it was the smoke rather than\r\nrarefied air which had the ascending power. The balloon, thus inflated,\r\nrose about a mile in a direct line, and then described a horizontal line\r\nof about seven thousand feet, after which it gradually sunk. The next\r\nattempt was upon a balloon of lutestring dipped in a solution of India\r\nrubber, and filled with hydrogen gas. The experiment at first failed,\r\nbut on the twenty-seventh of August, the same year, at Paris, the\r\nballoon rose beautifully to a great hight, and fell about twelve miles\r\noff. Soon after, animals (sheep, ducks, &c.) were sent up; and on the\r\nfifteenth of October, the first human aeronaut made an ascent of a\r\nhundred feet. The balloon, however, was held by a rope, and connection\r\nwith the earth not entirely severed. A month later, on the twenty-first\r\nof November, the daring feat of completely leaving the earth was\r\nperformed by two gentlemen, one of whom was M. Rosier, and the other the\r\nMarquis d’Arlandes. The balloon was a _Montgolfier_, or one in which the\r\nelevating power was air rarefied by fire. The signature of Benjamin\r\nFranklin, who at that time was American minister to Paris, is upon the\r\nofficial paper describing the balloon, its dimensions, &c. It was\r\nseventy feet high, forty-six in diameter, and carried a weight of from\r\nsixteen to seventeen hundred pounds; it rose to the hight of five miles\r\nin twenty-five minutes. When the aeronauts wished to ascend still\r\nhigher, they shook a bundle of straw into the flame; when they wished to\r\nsink, they let the fire smolder, or extinguished it with a wet sponge.\r\nThe attempt was successful, and the voyagers alighted in safety, after\r\nan absence of a little less than an hour.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE AIR BALLOON.]\r\n\r\nThe first trial of a hydrogen balloon was made a week later, from the\r\ngarden of the Tuilleries, just after sunset. It ascended two miles with\r\nperfect ease; its occupants here came in sight of the sun, which seemed\r\nto rise again, as at morning, in the east. The balloon and its two\r\ntravelers were the only illuminated objects, all the rest of nature\r\nbeing plunged in shadow. During the next two years, many ascensions were\r\nmade by different persons, and successive improvements and inventions\r\nwere added. The parachute was invented in 1784, and the first attempt at\r\nsteering a balloon was made in this year, but without success. In 1802,\r\nM. Garnerin descended successfully from a great hight by means of a\r\nparachute. In 1806, two aeronauts ascended to such a distance, that they\r\ncame into an atmosphere so rarefied as to burst the balloon. The\r\nremnants, however, broke the fall, and they descended in safety. From\r\nthe beginning of this century to the present day, but little progress\r\nhas been made in an art which seems destined to be of little service to\r\nmankind. No possible means of guiding the balloon have yet been\r\ndiscovered, or any practicable method of giving it a horizontal motion,\r\nso as to withdraw it from the influence of winds and currents. It has\r\nnow become a mere toy, and for any practical or scientific purpose, has\r\nlong since ceased to be of the slightest account.\r\n\r\nOne of the largest balloons ever constructed is that of Mr. Green, a\r\ncelebrated English aeronaut, which is called the Continent, and has made\r\nmany ascensions from London and Paris. The following account of an\r\nascent from the Hippodrome at Paris, in 1848, is from a leading French\r\njournal. It is from the pen of Theophile Gautier, an eminent Parisian\r\nromancer and _feuilletonist_.\r\n\r\n“Last Sunday, about five o’clock in the afternoon, Green’s balloon\r\nsprung from the inclosure of the Hippodrome into the blue abyss of the\r\nheavens. The ascension of a balloon is certainly not a novelty at the\r\npresent day; but an aerostat, like the one belonging to Green, is not of\r\nthe ordinary class: its colossal dimensions, the extraordinary care with\r\nwhich it is constructed, the comfort of its arrangements, make it the\r\nwonder of aerial navigation, and place it in the rank of a vessel of a\r\nhundred guns. To see it swelling its enormous taffeta case under the\r\nnet-work of cords which holds the car lined with red velvet, one feels\r\nperfectly at ease as to the dangerous chances of a voyage through the\r\nair. It would seem safer than an excursion in a diligence or upon a\r\nrailroad. Admitted into the reserved inclosure, we of course saw the\r\ndeparture, being near the spot. Nothing could be more quiet or more\r\ngentle. Mr. Green, in a black coat and white cravat, like a gentleman\r\ngoing out to dine, stepped into his carriage—I should say his\r\nballoon—with confidence and self-possession. A charming young English\r\ngirl, accompanied by a friend, had already taken her place in the boat\r\nor car. She was calm and smiling; animation tinged her cheeks slightly,\r\nbut it arose rather from embarrassment at seeing so many eyes fixed upon\r\nher, than from any fear whatever. Her intelligent face breathed that\r\nconfidence in the inventions of human genius, which characterizes the\r\nEnglish and American races. A Parisian lady would have screamed loudly.\r\n\r\n“The balloon held by cords, trembled, and balanced itself, preparing to\r\ntake flight. A strong cord still held it to the earth, but soon, upon a\r\nsignal from Mr. Green, the cable was cut, and the aerial vessel arose\r\nsteadily, with a movement at once easy, powerful, and of exceeding\r\nmajesty. As much as the locomotive has an infernal appearance, so has\r\nthe balloon a celestial one, without any play upon words. The one\r\nborrows its auxiliaries from iron, coal, fire and boiling water; the\r\nother employs only silk and gas, a thin cloth filled with a light wind.\r\nThe engine, with its frightful shrieks, its noisy rattling, and its\r\nblack puffs of smoke, runs upon inflexible rails, roars through the\r\nbowels of the earth, and dives into the darkness of tunnels, seeming as\r\nif seeking some evil genius who might have invented it; the balloon,\r\nwithout noise and without effort, leaves the earth, where the laws of\r\ngravity hold us, and mounts tranquilly up toward heaven. Unhappily, the\r\nballoon, like the fancied inspiration of the poet, goes where the wind\r\nguides it; this every one knows; while the steam-engine, like prose,\r\ngoes straight upon its road. Green and his balloon were soon overlooking\r\nParis and all its horizon; long trails of sand, ballast that he threw\r\nover to raise himself higher, streaked the heavens with their white\r\ntracks, proving, by the time it took them to descend to the earth, the\r\nhight to which the intrepid aeronaut had mounted in a few minutes. He\r\nhad disappeared, while the crowd was still looking for him, in the blue\r\ndepths of the atmosphere. What a splendid and magnificent spectacle the\r\ntriumphal arch, and the giant city with its black ants, illuminated by\r\nthe setting sun, must have afforded him! What greatness, and at the same\r\ntime what littleness! and how mean, from that distance, must seem the\r\ncares and ambitions of the world!\r\n\r\n“While looking with the rest of the crowd, a world of thoughts came\r\nwhirling through our brain. The balloon, which it was endeavored to make\r\nperform a useful part in the battle of Fleurus, and at the siege of\r\nToulon, has only been considered, up to this time, as an amusing\r\nexperiment of natural philosophy. It is made to figure in _fetes_ and in\r\npublic solemnities; for the crowd, who have more feeling for great\r\nthings than academies and wise bodies, feel an interest in balloon\r\nascensions, which has not diminished since the first attempts of\r\nMontgolfier. It is a profoundly human instinct, which induces us to\r\nfollow into the air, until it is lost to the sight, this globe swelled\r\nwith smoke, as if it contained the destinies of the future. Man, the\r\nking of creation in intelligence, is, physically, but indifferently\r\nendowed. He has neither the swiftness of the stag, the eye of the eagle,\r\nthe scent of a dog, the wing of the bird, nor the fin of the fish; for\r\neverything in man is sacrificed to the brain. All these auxiliaries he\r\nhas been forced to furnish himself by the skill of his hand and the\r\nsweat of his brow. The horse, the carriage and the rail-car make up to\r\nhim for his want of speed; the telescope and the microscope equal the\r\neagle’s eye; the compass enables him to follow a track as unerringly as\r\na dog; the ship, the steamboat and the diving-bell open to him the\r\ndominion of the waters. Nothing remained but the air, where the bird\r\nescaped us, followed only a few hundred feet by the arrow or gun,\r\ningenious means of bringing distances nearer together. It really seems\r\nas if God should have given us such wings as the painters lend the\r\nangels; but the beauty and grandeur of man consist in his not having\r\nthese giant appendages, or being embarrassed by fins. With the power of\r\nthought, and the hand, that admirable tool, he must seek and find, out\r\nof himself, all his physical powers.\r\n\r\n“The idea of mounting into the air is not new; it is not to-day that\r\nPhaeton asked to get into Phœbus’s car, and that Dædalus launched into\r\nthe air his son Icarus. Their descents were only unaccomplished ascents.\r\nThe griffins, the hippogriffs, the Pegasus, the winged shoes of Mercury,\r\nthe arrow of Abarys, the carpet of the four Facardins, testify to the\r\ncontinuance and persistence of this idea. At night, does not the dream\r\ndeliver us from the laws of weight? Does it not give us the faculty of\r\ngoing, of coming, and of flying to the summit of things before\r\nunattainable, or of losing ourselves in the infinite hights? This\r\ngeneral and oft-repeated dream, which expresses the secret desire of\r\nhumanity, has it not something prophetic? Perhaps modern skepticism\r\ntreats too lightly the meaning of these flights of the soul, temporarily\r\nfreed from the more earthly control of reason and sense. With the\r\nastonishing simplicity of the operations of nature, a miracle took place\r\nin the fireplace, without attracting attention, every time that the\r\nsmoke carried out of the chimney a piece of burnt paper. It required six\r\nthousand years to take a hint from this simple fact. The balloon floats\r\nin the air as oil floats upon wine, as cork upon water, as the\r\ncannon-ball upon mercury, by relations of weight and of lightness, one\r\nsingle law everywhere. But unfortunately, the balloon has neither wings,\r\nnor tail, nor neck, nor feet, nothing which can guide it; it is a vessel\r\nwithout sail or helm, a fish without fins, a bird without feathers; it\r\nfloats, that is all; it is immense, and it is nothing. Why do not all\r\nthe inventors, wise mechanicians, chemists, poets, occupy themselves by\r\nendeavoring to solve the problem of the guiding of balloons? Is it not\r\nshameful for man to have found the hippogriff which transports him to\r\nthe celestial regions, and not to know how to guide it; while every day\r\nthe birds go and come on airy wings, as if to instruct and defy us? The\r\nair, although a fluid, offers points of propulsion, since the condor, or\r\nthe sparrow, mounts, descends, goes to the right and left, quickly or\r\nslowly, as he pleases; and why should not man be able to do the same?\r\nThe time when he shall do this may be near. That will be a great day!\r\nMan will truly become master of his planet, and will have conquered his\r\natmosphere! No more seas, no more rivers, no more mountains, no more\r\nvalleys; that will be the true reign of liberty. Merely by this\r\nknowledge of the direction of balloons, the whole face of the world will\r\nchange immediately. Other forms of government, other manners, a new\r\nstyle of architecture, a different system of fortification, will be\r\nneeded; but then men will no longer make war. The custom-house and its\r\ntaxes, and the stronghold, will disappear. Visit, if you can, with your\r\ngauge and your yardstick, balloons ten thousand feet in the air; of what\r\nuse will be moats, ditches, portcullis and bridges, against an aerial\r\narmy? What a fine spectacle it will be to see crossing one another in\r\nthe air, at different hights, these swarms of balloons, painted with\r\nbrilliant colors, guided during the day by the light, and at night with\r\ntheir lanterns, having the appearance of stars traversing the firmament!\r\nThe ascension of the highest mountains will then be but child’s play. We\r\nshall penetrate into China, and go to Timbuctoo as one goes to St.\r\nCloud; the deserts of Africa, of Asia and of America, will be forced to\r\ndeliver up their secrets. We shall go even to the border of the\r\natmosphere which surrounds us. We shall visit creation in every nook and\r\nrecess. There will be servant balloons and master balloons; and in\r\nspeaking of the luxury or extravagance of a person, it will be said, ‘He\r\nis rich; he has a balloon of thirty-four thousand cubic feet of gas;’\r\nwhich will be equivalent to saying that he has a coach and four. And\r\nwhen this dream is realized, the execution of another, already dreamed\r\nby the poets, will be attempted. Man, arrived at the outward limits of\r\nhis atmosphere, will wish to leave his planet; and will seriously\r\nattempt to reach the moon! And who shall say that at some time he shall\r\nnot do it?”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EARLY NAVIGATION.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                      THE PROGRESS OF NAVIGATION.\r\n\r\nOne of the wonders of the world, is to be found in tracing the _progress\r\nof navigation_, from its small beginning, up to its present wonderful\r\ncondition and results. There is an old legend, that, ages ago, a piece\r\nof reed floating on the water, first suggested the idea of navigation.\r\nAnd if so, the next step might have been, the use of logs for crossing\r\nrivers; then, the use of rafts; then, of canoes of hollowed logs; and\r\nthen, of artificial boats, of various forms and materials, some of wood,\r\nsome of skins, and some of bark. The earliest navigators on an extended\r\nscale were the Phœnicians, who made voyages through the Mediterranean,\r\nand along the northern coasts of Europe, and down the Red sea, as early\r\nas the days of Solomon, one thousand years before the Christian era.\r\nTheir earliest attempts to navigate the waters, might perhaps be\r\nrepresented in the following cut, in which several forms of boats may be\r\nseen. Their larger and later vessels were somewhat of the shape of those\r\nnow in use, though more perhaps of the Dutch, than of the English or\r\nAmerican form. The sails of these vessels are said to have been\r\nsuggested by the little sea animal, called the _nautilus_. The vessels\r\nthemselves had no decks, and were not over twenty or thirty tuns’\r\nburden. They had masts and rudders, and the prow was decorated with\r\npaint and gilding, and represented the image of some god. The ships of\r\nthe Greeks and Romans, in after times, were larger, but they were\r\nuncouth structures, managed with difficulty, and liable to numerous\r\naccidents and hindrances. The war ships were nothing but large\r\nrow-boats. These were very long and narrow, like canoes. The cable and\r\nanchor were later inventions. The latter at first was a large stone. In\r\nthe days of the Roman emperors, vessels of immense size were\r\noccasionally built, but they were of little use, except for the\r\ntransportation of heavy objects. In the middle ages, navigation made\r\nlittle progress; but about the close of the fifteenth century, its\r\nstrides were prodigious. The mariner’s compass had been invented, and\r\nthe sailor had now a guide over the mysterious ocean. Hence America was\r\ndiscovered in 1492, though the three ships of Columbus were not so large\r\nas our common schooners, and had no proper decks; so that it seems a\r\nwonder to us, that with these comparatively small vessels he should have\r\nventured so far on the mighty deep. From his day to the present, there\r\nhas been a steady advance in ship-building. The forms of vessels have\r\nbeen improved; their size greatly increased; and their number\r\nmultiplied, a thousand fold; so that if the great navigator were now\r\nagain to visit the earth, he would be astonished at the huge structures\r\nbuilt as packet and freight ships for crossing the ocean. For a long\r\ntime, the English took the lead in ship-building; but it is now admitted\r\nthat the fastest vessels in the world, as well as those of most graceful\r\nappearance, are those built in the United States. In the cut above, is a\r\nview of one of our large packet-ships, just ready to be launched from\r\nthe stocks. Vessels of this class may vary from fifteen hundred to two\r\nthousand tuns’ burden; their main cabins are beautifully furnished with\r\nmahogany and gilded carvings; and no expense is spared that may\r\ncontribute to their elegance, or the comfort of passengers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE LAUNCH OF A PACKET-SHIP.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                           STEAM NAVIGATION.\r\n\r\nSo far as we know, the ancients were unacquainted with the nature and\r\nproperties of steam. Some accounts, indeed, have come down to us, of\r\nengines of a very early date, such, for example, as that proposed by\r\nHero, of Alexandria, in which the mechanical agency of steam was more or\r\nless used; but it does not appear that those who invented and applied\r\nthese machines, understood the properties of vapor, or had any correct\r\nidea of the effect of heat when applied to liquids. Even at a much later\r\ndate, the effects produced by steam were ascribed, not to the vapor of\r\nwater, but to the force of the air which was supposed to be expelled\r\nfrom water by heat. In the seventeenth century, De Caus proposed the\r\nconstruction of a machine by which a column of water was raised by the\r\nelastic force of steam, but he does not seem to have understood the\r\nprinciple on which it was effected. About the middle of the same\r\ncentury, Lord Worcester published the description of a high pressure\r\nsteam-engine, which has since formed so remarkable a feature in all\r\nhistories of steam-engines. Toward the latter end of the century,\r\nhowever, the actual properties of vapor began to be more unfolded. In\r\n1683, Sir Samuel Morland discovered the exact numerical proportion in\r\nwhich water increases its volume when evaporated. A few years later,\r\nPapin discovered the method of producing a vacuum by the condensation of\r\nsteam; and this discovery was, by others, soon applied to mechanical\r\npurposes. About the middle of the eighteenth century, Watt applied\r\nhimself to the improvement of the steam-engine; and from this time\r\nforward, the various discoveries of chemistry, and the experiments of\r\nscientific and practical men, prepared the way for rapid progress in the\r\napplication of steam.\r\n\r\nIn 1793, Fulton, the celebrated engineer, engaged actively in\r\nendeavoring to improve inland navigation. Even at that early period, he\r\nhad conceived the idea of propelling vessels by steam; and he speaks, in\r\nsome of his manuscripts, with great confidence of its practicability. In\r\n1797, he went to Paris, and, while there, projected the first panorama\r\nthat was ever exhibited there. He also planned a _submarine boat_. In\r\n1803, he completed his first steamboat, which was tried upon the Seine,\r\nand proved completely successful. He now proceeded to New York, to carry\r\nhis ideas of steam navigation into practical effect; and in 1807, his\r\nfirst steamboat, a view of which is given in the cut beyond, ascended\r\nthe Hudson river, to the great delight and wonder of thousands of\r\nspectators. She was called the Clermont; and was only one hundred feet\r\nlong, twelve wide, and seven deep. Her first trip was made, September\r\nfirst, 1807, from New York to Albany, one hundred and sixty miles, in\r\nthirty-six hours; the fare for the passage being seven dollars,\r\nexclusive of meals. Thus this great man brought to a successful issue\r\nhis long meditated invention, and determined the possibility of applying\r\nsteam to navigation. Several steamboats were soon after constructed\r\nunder Mr. Fulton’s directions, and also a steam-frigate. He continued to\r\nmake various experiments till his death, which occurred in 1815.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FULTON’S FIRST STEAMBOAT.]\r\n\r\nStill later than this, we find a description of the Clyde steamboat,\r\nwhich is spoken of in an English magazine as follows: “Its extreme\r\nlength is seventy-five feet, its breadth fourteen feet, and the hight of\r\nthe cabins six and a half feet. She is built very flat, and draws from\r\ntwo feet and nine inches to three feet of water. The best or\r\nafter-cabin, is twenty feet long, and is entered from the stern: between\r\nthe after-cabin and the engine, a space of fifteen feet is allotted for\r\ngoods. The engine is a twelve horsepower, and occupies fifteen feet; the\r\nfore-cabin is sixteen feet long, and is entered from the side. The\r\npaddles, sixteen in number, form two wheels of nine feet diameter, and\r\nfour feet broad, made of hammered iron: they dip into the water from one\r\nfoot and three inches to one foot and six inches. Along the outer edge\r\nof these wheels a platform and rail are formed quite round the vessel,\r\nprojecting over the sides, and supported by timbers reaching down to the\r\nvessel’s side. This steamboat runs at the rate of four or four and a\r\nhalf miles per hour in calm weather; but against a considerable breeze,\r\nthree miles only. It can accommodate two hundred and fifty passengers,\r\nand is wrought by five men. The engine consumes twelve hundred weight of\r\ncoals per day. The funnel of the boiler is twenty-five feet high; and\r\ncarries a square-sail twenty-two feet in breadth.”\r\n\r\nIn the same connection, we find an article published in the Monthly\r\nMagazine, by Sir Richard Phillips, with the express object of giving\r\nclear ideas of the utility of steamboats, and of quieting apprehensions\r\nas to their safety, which at the present day it is truly amusing to\r\nread. The writer says: “The groundless alarms relative to a supposed\r\nincrease of danger from traveling by steam-packets, led the editor of\r\nthe Monthly Magazine, within the current month, (July, 1817,) to make a\r\nvoyage, in one of them, from London to Margate. This vessel left her\r\nmoorings, at the Tower of London, about half past eight in the morning,\r\nat the time the tide was running strong up the river, and when no other\r\nvessel could make progress, except in the direction of the tides. The\r\nsteam-packet proceeded, however, against the stream, in a gallant style,\r\nat the rate of six or seven miles an hour; and a band of music, playing\r\nlively airs on the deck, combined with the steadiness of the motion, to\r\nrender the effect delightful. An examination of the steam-engine, and of\r\nher rate of working, proved that no possibility of danger exists. It\r\nappeared that the boiler had been proved at twenty-five pounds to the\r\nsquare inch; but that the valve was held down by a weight of only four\r\npounds, and that the mercurial gauge did not indicate an employment of\r\nactual pressure of above two pounds and a half per square inch. Hence it\r\nfollows, that, although the engine was capable of sustaining a pressure\r\nof at least twenty-five pounds, only four pounds, or less than a sixth,\r\nwas the whole force which the valve would permit to be exerted; and\r\nthat, in point of fact, a pressure of only two pounds and a half to the\r\nsquare inch, or only _one-tenth_ of the proven power of the boiler, was\r\nemployed. There is, therefore, less danger in passing some hours in\r\ncontact with such a machine, than there is in sitting near a boiling\r\ntea-kettle, tea-urn, or saucepan, under circumstances in which they are\r\noften used. Opposite Greenwich, a fine commentary was afforded of the\r\nvalue of steam as a navigating power, in preference to winds and tides;\r\na Margate sailing-packet passing toward London, which had been a day and\r\ntwo nights on its passage, a period of time which it appears is not\r\nuncommon. In short, with uninterrupted pleasure, and in an hour sooner\r\nthan the captain had named at starting, the vessel was carried\r\nalong-side Margate pier, having employed nine hours in performing a\r\nvoyage of ninety miles. In this case it appeared, that a pressure of two\r\npounds to the square inch, produced about forty rotations per minute of\r\nthe acting water-wheels; and, as these were ten feet in diameter, the\r\nmotion of the impelling floats, or wheel-paddles, would be at the rate\r\nof fifteen with, or against the stream, at an average of ten miles an\r\nhour. The consumption of coals during the voyage was less than a\r\ncaldron; but it was described as amounting frequently to a caldron and a\r\nhalf. On the whole, nothing could be more demonstrative of the worth and\r\nsecurity of this mode of navigation; and there can be little doubt but,\r\nin a few years, vessels of every size, and for every extent of voyage,\r\nwill be provided with their steam-engine, which will be more used, and\r\nmore depended upon, than winds or tides. The chances of accidents are\r\nlower than those under most other circumstances in which men are placed\r\nin traveling. By land, horses kill their thousands _per annum_, open\r\nchaises their hundreds, and stage-coaches their scores; and, by water,\r\nthe uncertainty of winds has destroyed thousands, by prolonging the\r\nvoyage, and increasing the exposure to bad weather; but in a\r\nsteam-packet, navigated by an engine whose proven powers necessarily\r\nexceed what can be exerted during its use, or in general by such engines\r\nas those used on the Thames or Clyde, no accident can possibly happen;\r\nunless, by a miracle, it were to happen, that a force of _four_ pounds\r\nshould overcome a resistance of _twenty-four_ pounds.”\r\n\r\nFrom the above amusing article, we pass to notice the immense ocean\r\nsteamers of the present day, as they so forcibly illustrate the progress\r\nof steam navigation. The chief lines of those with which we are\r\nfamiliar, are the Cunard line and the Collins line, both plying between\r\nthe United States and England. Before describing them particularly,\r\nhowever, it should here be mentioned, that the first steamship that ever\r\ncrossed the Atlantic sailed from Savannah, in Georgia, for Liverpool, on\r\nthe twenty-sixth of May, 1819, and made the voyage in twenty-two days.\r\nShe was telegraphed at Liverpool as “_a ship on fire_” and a\r\nrevenue-cutter was dispatched to her relief, when the officers and crew\r\nof the latter were struck with astonishment at not being able to\r\novertake a vessel _under bare poles_. At Liverpool, and afterward at\r\nCopenhagen, Stockholm, and St. Petersburg, whither she went, she was\r\nvisited by crowds of wondering people; and at the latter place a service\r\nof plate was presented to her officers. She was commanded by Captain\r\nRodgers, of New London, Conn., and some of her officers are still\r\nliving. After this, it was a long time before another steamship crossed\r\nthe Atlantic. At last, however, the experiment was again and still again\r\ntried, until now the ocean is constantly traversed by the huge steamers\r\nabove alluded to, in the average time of about eleven days and a half,\r\nthough the passage has been made, in some single cases, in a little over\r\nnine days.\r\n\r\nA good idea of these ocean steamers may be formed from the view given of\r\none of them in the cut below, in connection with the following\r\ndescription of the Baltic, belonging to the Collins line.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AN OCEAN STEAMER.]\r\n\r\nThe Baltic is of thirty-two hundred tuns’ burden, carpenter’s measure;\r\nin length, two hundred and eighty-seven feet; breadth of beam, forty-six\r\nfeet; depth of hold, thirty-two feet; to the top of the gunwale,\r\nthirty-four feet and six inches. The diameter of her wheels is\r\nthirty-six feet; the number of floats, (corresponding to the buckets or\r\npaddles of a common water-wheel,) twenty-six in each wheel; their\r\nlength, twelve feet and a half; their breadth, twenty-eight, and their\r\nthickness, three inches and a half; each float being armed with three\r\nhundred pounds of iron, so that it requires six men to lift it. The\r\nengine has two working cylinders, each ninety-six inches in diameter;\r\nthe length of their stroke is ten feet; and the number of revolutions is\r\nfrom eleven to fourteen in a minute. The vacuum is equivalent to\r\nfourteen pounds upon the square inch; a near approximation to a perfect\r\nvacuum, which corresponds to fifteen pounds on the square inch. The\r\npressure of steam is from twelve to twenty pounds upon the square inch;\r\nusually from twelve to fifteen pounds; this is all the amount of the\r\npower tending to produce explosion, while including what is gained by\r\nthe vacuum, the effective motive power is equivalent to twenty-six,\r\ntwenty-nine and thirty-four pounds on the square inch. The highest\r\npressure used in an ordinary passage may be about eighteen pounds,\r\nequivalent to a working force of thirty-two pounds; and the lowest about\r\nseven or eight pounds, giving a moving force of twenty-one or twenty-two\r\npounds. The ability of the boilers corresponds to fifty pounds, and with\r\nthe addition of the vacuum, to sixty-four pounds; it follows, therefore,\r\nthat they are generally worked with less than half their power. The\r\nentire weight of the steam machinery is one thousand tuns, and it\r\noccupies sixty feet in the length of the ship.\r\n\r\nAs to capacity for passengers, there are one hundred and sixty berths,\r\naside from the accommodations for the people of the ship. As to strength\r\nof structure, the timbers are fitted side by side, and calked so tight\r\nthat it was said the ship would float even before she was planked.\r\nPlates of iron six inches wide and an inch and a quarter thick, are let,\r\nobliquely, into the timbers at the distance of twenty-eight inches from\r\nthe centers of each, and therefore they are twenty-two inches apart.\r\nThese are crossed obliquely by other bars or plates of the same\r\ndimensions, which are let into the boards or planks that are nailed over\r\nthem. Copper bolts, for twenty feet from the keel, pass through the\r\nplates of iron at their intersection, and in many other places, and\r\ncopper sheathing covers eighteen feet of the lower part of the hull, the\r\ndraught being nineteen feet, and twenty with the coal in. The ships of\r\nthis line are as strong as wood, iron and copper can make them, and they\r\nhardly leak at all. They would bear long thumping upon the rocks before\r\nthey would go to pieces. The movement of the machinery, and the stroke\r\nof the waves, produce scarcely a perceptible tremor, and not the\r\nslightest deviation in the deck from a right line can be seen, when\r\nviewed horizontally from stem to stern through its length of nearly\r\nthree hundred feet. No opening of a joint is perceived even in the beams\r\nthat form the capping of the gunwale; a knife-blade can not be passed\r\nbetween their contiguous ends.\r\n\r\nThe machinery rests on an iron bed-plate, on the keelson, or engine bed;\r\nand the bed-plate, which is cast in one piece, weighs forty tuns. The\r\nmachinery is below, and is invisible from the deck, except through\r\ncertain doors. A wave can hardly reach it at all, even should it break\r\nover the ship; and by closing the apertures above, the engine room is\r\nsafe from flooding, while ventilation is secured by large tubes, having\r\ntheir orifices higher than the upper or promenade deck. The people\r\nbelow, on the level of the keelson, where there is little motion, hardly\r\nknow when there is a storm above; they live in a comparatively quiet\r\nworld of their own, and always in a tropical climate, even when among\r\nicebergs. The working of the machinery is admirable. It travels onward\r\nwith the greatest ease and regularity; even with a heavy head-wind and\r\nopposing waves, it moves like clockwork, without apparent labor,\r\nthrowing up its mighty arms and moving its ponderous levers as if there\r\nwere no weight to be lifted, or _vis inertiæ_ to be overcome. By\r\nobservations made up to the tenth day of one of the passages, there had\r\nnot been the slightest leak of steam, nor had it been necessary to turn\r\na screw, although for several days together there was a heavy head-sea,\r\nimpelled by adverse winds. Except the effect of hidden flaws in the\r\nimmense masses of wrought iron that form some of the principal moving\r\nparts, there seems to be little cause for anxiety, as the machinery\r\nappears to be, in general, equal to every emergency.\r\n\r\nDanger from fire, is always a subject of anxiety; but in ships protected\r\nas the Baltic is, the danger is believed to be less than in a sailing\r\nship. The engine room is lined with iron; the boilers and their furnaces\r\nare everywhere surrounded by that metal and by water, and no wood is in\r\na position to be unduly heated. All lights, except those necessary to\r\nthe management of the ship, are extinguished at eleven o’clock; many\r\npeople are up all night, and are about in every place; there are\r\nfire-engines always ready to flood the ship, and they are adapted so as\r\nto be wrought both by hand and by steam power. The behavior of the\r\nBaltic as a sea-boat, is admirable in every variety of weather. This\r\nimmense vessel rides upon the waves like a duck, and has, in general, a\r\ndry and comfortable deck, rarely shipping a sea, although the spray\r\ndashes over the forecastle in showers. The ship is warmed by steam\r\ntubes, passing under the marble tables. More than fifty persons are\r\nemployed about the machinery, of whom forty-eight attend to the coal and\r\nthe fires, and there are six or eight engineers. There are between\r\nthirty and forty servants, twenty or twenty-five sailors, and three or\r\nfour supernumerary officers; in all, about one hundred and forty,\r\nbesides passengers. The style and furnishing of the Baltic are elegant,\r\nrich enough for a nobleman’s villa. Of mirrors, large and small, there\r\nare about fifty; indeed, they are in such excess that a passenger can\r\nnot look in any direction without meeting his own image or the faces of\r\nhis companions. The tables of these steamers are amply supplied, and\r\nhave the best attendance; and of luxuries, there seems to be no end. The\r\nsaloons of these steamers are fitted up in superb style. Some of the\r\ntable-covers are of beautiful variegated marble, and the panels around\r\nare finely decorated with emblems of the various American states. The\r\ncabin-windows are of beautiful painted glass, embellished with the arms\r\nof various American cities. There are large circular glass ventilators\r\nreaching from the deck to the lower saloon. There is a rich and elegant\r\nladies’ drawing-room near the chief saloon, and there are berths for\r\nabout one hundred and fifty passengers. Each berth has a bell-rope\r\ncommunicating with one of Jackson’s patented American annunciators.\r\nCrossing the ocean in one of these steamers, some one has said, is _no\r\ncross at all_!\r\n\r\nSuch are the present ocean steamers; and yet even these immense\r\nstructures will soon be thrown in the background by steamers of still\r\nvaster dimensions. For the Edinburgh Journal gives an account of an\r\nimmense iron steamer, now (1855) being constructed for the Australian\r\ntrade, which will far surpass them. The actual measurements of this\r\nleviathan vessel are, six hundred and seventy-five feet long,\r\neighty-three feet wide at her greatest breadth of beam, and sixty feet\r\ndeep in the hold, forming four decks. She will be furnished with\r\npaddle-wheels and a screw, the former of a nominal power of one thousand\r\nhorses, the latter of sixteen hundred horses; but practically, the\r\ncombined power may be estimated at three thousand horses. The four\r\ncylinders in which the pistons are to work, are the largest in the\r\nworld; each of them weighs twenty-eight tuns. When they are lying on the\r\nground, a man, with his hat on, may walk through them without touching\r\nthe upper side. The engines, when erected and put together, will be\r\nupward of fifty feet in hight. The weight of the entire machinery will\r\nbe about three thousand tuns, and of the hull, ten thousand tuns, making\r\nthirteen thousand tuns. She will carry several thousand tuns of coal and\r\nmerchandise, sixteen hundred passengers, and her measurement capacity\r\ngives about twenty-five thousand tuns’ burden! Notwithstanding, her\r\ndraught of water will be but small, not exceeding twenty feet when\r\nlight, and thirty feet when fully loaded. She will carry five or six\r\nmasts, and five funnels. Her cost will be about eighteen hundred\r\nthousand dollars. She will carry coal enough for a voyage round the\r\nworld, and is built upon a model to insure great speed. Her ordinary\r\nspeed is expected to be eighteen or twenty miles an hour. She is\r\nexpected to make the voyage from England to Australia in thirty days,\r\nand return by Cape Horn in thirty days more; thus making the circuit of\r\nthe globe in two months.\r\n\r\nMore wonderful still, it is said that Mr. Vanderbilt, of New York, is\r\nabout building an immense steamer, which is to be eight hundred feet in\r\nlength, and of corresponding proportions throughout, which of course\r\nwill surpass even the huge steamship just described. Where the rivalry\r\nand enterprise in this matter are to end, who can tell?\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHINESE JUNKS.\r\n\r\nAs in perfect and wonderful contrast to the magnificent floating palaces\r\njust described, we close the subject of navigation by a view of the\r\nclumsy Chinese junk, which is represented in the cut below. The Chinese,\r\nthough neither a savage, nor a barbarous people, are still, in most\r\nrespects, very unlike other civilized nations. In houses, dress,\r\nfurniture, equipage, worship, indeed, in most of the actions, feelings,\r\nand opinions of life, they are a peculiar people. They have, in fact,\r\nstruck out a civilization of their own. Their religion, their\r\nliterature, their arts, are all Chinese, and nothing but Chinese. It is\r\ncurious to observe that although, for many centuries, they have been a\r\ncultivated people, and have even preceded the Europeans in many useful\r\nand ingenious discoveries, they seem to stand still at a certain point,\r\nbeyond which they are not capable of improvement. There they remain,\r\ncentury after century; and, while other nations have surpassed them,\r\nthey still conceive that they are the most learned, civilized and\r\npolished people in the world. All other nations they conceive to be\r\nbarbarians, and hold them in supercilious contempt. And the Chinese\r\nvessels may serve as a sample of their national character. We give above\r\na picture of one of their junks, which shows some ingenuity, and no\r\nlittle industry; yet how clumsy, how ineffective is it, in comparison\r\nwith a Yankee steamboat! The Chinese can go, by dint of rowing, three\r\nmiles an hour, while we go fifteen. This is about the difference between\r\nthe energy of the Chinese and the civilized people of Europe and\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHINESE JUNKS.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                     THE ARTESIAN WELL OF GRENELLE.\r\n\r\nArtesian wells, or fountains, are made by boring in the earth to a great\r\ndepth, till at last water rises to the surface, and often with such\r\nforce as to form abundant and elevated jets. The name _artesian_ is\r\nderived from Artois, a province of France, where especial attention has\r\nbeen given to this means of obtaining water; though it appears from\r\nsufficient evidence, that wells of this kind were well known to the\r\nancients. Olympiadorus, who flourished in the sixth century at\r\nAlexandria, states that where wells were dug in the oases of the desert\r\nto the depth of two, three or five hundred yards, rivers of water gushed\r\nout from their orifices, of which advantage was taken by agriculturists\r\nto water their fields. The oldest artesian well known in France, is at\r\nLillers, in Artois, and is said to have been made in 1126. In the great\r\ndesert of Sahara, water is said to have been obtained in this way; and\r\nthe Chinese, we are told, have practiced it for thousands of years.\r\nArtesian wells are now common in Europe and in the United States. The\r\nartesian well of Grenelle, is a famous fountain of this kind, and as\r\nsuch is worthy of notice. It is not far from the Hotel des Invalides,\r\nand was undertaken chiefly with reference to the great slaughter-houses\r\nin its vicinity. It was begun January first, 1834, and the boring was\r\nprosecuted during seven years and two months. It opened with a diameter\r\nof twelve inches; at the depth of thirteen hundred feet it was\r\ncontracted to six inches. Water was struck at the depth of eighteen\r\nhundred feet, and the entire depth is two thousand feet, or nearly\r\ntwo-fifths of a mile. The water rose at first in a fine thread, but soon\r\nafter it came so rapidly as to injure the machinery. It rose to the\r\nhight of one hundred and twelve feet above the surface; high enough to\r\nflow into the attics of the most lofty houses in Paris, and into many of\r\nits towers. The entire depth of the boring is five and a half times the\r\nhight of the dome of the Hotel of the Invalids, and more than five times\r\nthat of the cross on the summit of St. Paul’s, in London. In a diagram\r\nof the strata, seen in section, the cathedral of Strasburg, and the\r\nchurch of St. Peter, at Rome, are figured at the bottom on the level of\r\nthe subterranean fountain, and they appear very humble, compared with\r\nthe great distance to the surface of the ground.\r\n\r\nThe flow of the water was equivalent to six hundred gallons in a minute;\r\nfive hundred thousand gallons in twenty-four hours; and the quantity\r\nthus far is not diminished. Some time after the opening of the well, it\r\nflowed bountifully over the top of the tube, and with a force that would\r\ndoubtless have raised it to the full hight, although at that time the\r\nupper part of the tube had been removed for repairs. It had collapsed,\r\nand a new tube was about to be inserted; the old tube was twenty-one\r\ninches wide at the top and seven at the bottom; but the new tube was to\r\nbe reduced to five inches. It is now, and was formerly, made of\r\ngalvanized iron. The temperature of the water, at first, was\r\neighty-three and three-fourths degrees of Fahrenheit, and it is now\r\nstated to be eighty-five degrees; a degree of permanent heat far\r\nexceeding that of midsummer in Paris. Indeed, it is so warm, that it\r\ndoes not answer for the use of the slaughter-houses, as was at first\r\nproposed, and they are compelled to resort to water from other sources.\r\nIt was quite warm to the touch, when a hand was immersed in it. The\r\nlabor attending this boring was immense; and great difficulties were\r\nencountered. The boring instrument broke several times, and fell in.\r\nThis happened at the depth of thirteen hundred and thirty-five feet, and\r\nit required incessant labor during fourteen months to recover it. The\r\ngovernment, at whose expense it was prosecuted, was, at times, nearly\r\ndiscouraged.\r\n\r\nQuite recently, in boring an artesian well in Livingston, Alabama, an\r\n_egg_ was brought up from the depth of three hundred and thirty-five\r\nfeet below the surface, of which distance, three hundred feet were\r\nthrough the solid rock. The egg was completely petrified, and perfect in\r\nshape, except in one place where the auger had defaced it. How it came\r\nthere, and in what remote age, it might puzzle the wisest geologist or\r\nphilosopher to tell!\r\n\r\n\r\n                            THE BANYAN-TREE.\r\n\r\nThe banyan, or burr tree, the _ficus Indica_ of Linnæus, a picture of\r\nwhich is given in the cut beyond, claims our particular attention. It is\r\nconsidered as one of the most curious and beautiful of Nature’s\r\nproductions in the genial climate of India, where she sports with the\r\ngreatest profusion and variety. Each tree is in itself a grove, and some\r\nof them are of an amazing size, as they are continually increasing, and,\r\ncontrary to most other animal and vegetable productions, seem to be\r\nexempted from decay: for every branch from the main body throws out its\r\nown roots, at first in small tender fibers, several yards from the\r\nground, which continually grow thicker; until by a gradual descent, they\r\nreach its surface; where, striking in, they increase to a large trunk,\r\nand become a parent tree, throwing out new branches from the top. These,\r\nin time, suspend their roots, and, receiving nourishment from the earth,\r\nswell into trunks, and shoot forth other branches; thus continuing in a\r\nstate of progression so long as the first parent of them all supplies\r\nher sustenance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE BANYAN-TREE.]\r\n\r\nA banyan-tree with many trunks, forms the most beautiful walks, vistas\r\nand cool recesses, that can be imagined. The leaves are large, soft, and\r\nof a lively green; the fruit is a small fig, of a bright scarlet when\r\nripe, affording sustenance to monkeys, squirrels, peacocks, and birds of\r\nvarious kinds, which dwell among the branches.\r\n\r\nThe Hindoos are peculiarly fond of this tree; they consider its long\r\nduration, its outstretching arms, and overshadowing beneficence, as\r\nemblems of the Deity, and almost pay it divine honors. The Brahmins, who\r\nthus “find a fane in every sacred grove,” spend much of their time in\r\nsuperstitious solitude under the shade of the banyan-tree; they plant it\r\nnear the _dewals_, or Hindoo temples, improperly called pagodas; and in\r\nthose villages where there is no structure for public worship, they\r\nplace an image under one of these trees, and there perform their morning\r\nand evening sacrifice. These are the trees under which a sect of naked\r\nphilosophers, called Gymnosophists, assembled in Arrian’s days; and this\r\nhistorian of ancient Greece, says Forbes, in his “Oriental Memoirs,”\r\naffords a true picture of the modern Hindoos. “In winter the\r\nGymnosophists enjoy the benefit of the sun’s rays in the open air; and\r\nin summer, when the heat becomes excessive, they pass their time in cool\r\nand moist places, under large trees; which, according to the accounts of\r\nNearchus, cover a circumference of five acres, and extend their branches\r\nso far, that ten thousand men may easily find shelter under them.”\r\n\r\nOn the banks of the Narbudda, in the province of Guzzerat, is a\r\nbanyan-tree, supposed by some persons to be the one described by\r\nNearchus, and certainly not inferior to it. It is distinguished by the\r\nname of the Cubbeer-Burr, which was given to it in honor of a famous\r\nsaint. High floods have, at various times, swept away a considerable\r\npart of this extraordinary tree; but what still remains is nearly two\r\nthousand feet in circumference, measured round the principal stems; the\r\noverhanging branches, not yet struck down, cover a much larger space;\r\nand under it grow a number of custard-apple, and other fruit trees. The\r\nlarge trunks of this single tree amount to _three hundred and fifty_,\r\nand the smaller ones _exceed three thousand_. Each of these is\r\nconstantly sending forth branches and hanging roots, to form other\r\ntrunks, and become the parents of a future progeny. The Cubbeer-Burr is\r\nfamed throughout Hindoostan, not only on account of its great extent,\r\nbut also of its surpassing beauty. The Indian armies generally encamp\r\naround it; and, at stated seasons, solemn _jatarras_, or Hindoo\r\nfestivals, to which thousands of votaries repair from every part of the\r\nMogul empire, are there celebrated. It is said that seven thousand\r\npeople find ample room to repose under its shade. It has long been the\r\ncustom of the British residents in India, on their hunting and shooting\r\nparties, to form extensive encampments, and spend weeks together, under\r\nthis magnificent pavilion, which affords a shelter to all travelers,\r\nparticularly to the religious tribes of the Hindoos. It is generally\r\nfilled with a variety of birds, snakes and monkeys, the latter of whom\r\nboth divert the spectator by their antic tricks, and interest him by the\r\nparental affection they display to their young offspring, in teaching\r\nthem to select their food, to exert themselves in jumping from bough to\r\nbough, and in taking, as they acquire strength, still more extensive\r\nleaps from tree to tree. In these efforts, they encourage them by\r\ncaresses, when timorous, and menace, and even beat them, when\r\nrefractory.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        THE WEDDED BANYAN-TREE.\r\n\r\nAmong the varieties of the banyan, or burr tree, is the _peipal_, or\r\n_ficus religiosa_, which is not uncommon in Guzzerat, and causes a\r\nsingular variety of vegetation. It may be considered as belonging to the\r\norder of creepers, and often springs round different trees, particularly\r\nthe palmyra, or palm. The latter growing through the center of a\r\nbanyan-tree, looks extremely grand. The peipal frequently shoots from\r\nold walls, and runs along them, so as to cause a singular phenomenon of\r\nvegetation. In the province of Bahar, one of these trees was seen by an\r\nEnglish traveler, on the inside of a large brick well, the whole\r\ncircumference of the internal space of which it lined, and thus actually\r\nbecame a tree turned inside out. A banyan-tree thus inverted is\r\nuncommon; but the general usefulness and beauty of this variety,\r\nespecially in overshadowing the public wells and village markets, can\r\nonly be known by those who live in a sultry climate.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            THE COCOA-TREE.\r\n\r\nOf all the gifts which Providence has bestowed on the oriental world,\r\nthe cocoa-tree is the one most deserving of notice. The blessings which\r\nare conveyed to man, by this single production of nature, are\r\nincalculable. It grows in a stately column, from thirty to fifty feet in\r\nhight, crowned by a verdant capital of waving branches, covered with\r\nlong spiral leaves: under this foliage, bunches of blossoms, clusters of\r\ngreen fruit, and others arrived at maturity, appear in mingled beauty.\r\nThe trunk, though porous, furnishes beams and rafters for the\r\nhabitations; and the leaves, when platted together, make an excellent\r\nthatch, as well as common umbrellas, coarse mats for the floor, and\r\nbrooms; while their finest fibers are woven into very beautiful mats for\r\nthe rich. The covering of the young fruit is extremely curious,\r\nresembling a piece of thick cloth, in a conical form, as close and firm\r\nas if it came from the loom; it expands after the fruit has burst\r\nthrough its inclosure, and then appears of a coarser texture. The nuts\r\ncontain a delicious milk, and a kernel sweet as the almond: this, when\r\ndried, affords abundance of oil; and when that is expressed, the\r\nremainder answers to feed cattle and poultry, and make a good manure.\r\nThe shell of the nut furnishes cups, ladles, and other domestic\r\nutensils; while the husk which incloses it is of the utmost importance:\r\nit is manufactured into ropes, and cordage of every kind, from the\r\nsmallest twine to the largest cables, which are far more durable than\r\nthose of hemp. In the Nicobar islands, the natives build their vessels,\r\nmake the sails and cordage, supply them with provisions and necessaries,\r\nand provide a cargo of arrack, vinegar, oil, jaggree or coarse sugar,\r\ncocoa-nuts, coir, cordage, black paint, and several inferior articles,\r\nfor foreign markets, entirely from this tree.\r\n\r\nMany of the trees are not permitted to bear fruit; but the embryo bud,\r\nfrom which the blossoms and nuts would spring, is tied up to prevent its\r\nexpansion; and a small incision being then made at the end, a cool\r\npleasant liquor, called _tarre_, or toddy, the palm-wine of the poets,\r\noozes out in gentle drops.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          THE REINDEER SLEDGE.\r\n\r\nThe reindeer is a native of Greenland, and the cold climates of the\r\nextreme north. To the Greenlander he supplies the place of the horse,\r\nthe locomotive, and the steamboat to us, as may be seen in the cut,\r\nwhich illustrates the mode of traveling in Greenland. The reindeer is\r\nswift of foot, sharp-sighted, and of acute smell and hearing. His flesh\r\nsupplies the Greenlander with food; while his skin, with its thick, warm\r\nhair, affords material for his tent, his bedding and his clothing. The\r\nbones and antlers, or horns, are worked into implements for domestic\r\nuse, for fishing and hunting, and the tendons are split into threads for\r\nvarious purposes. The speed of the Greenlander on his sledge, is said to\r\nrival that of the locomotive on the railroad.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE REINDEER SLEDGE.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                       THE UPAS, OR POISON-TREE.\r\n\r\nAlthough a serious refutation of the gross imposition practiced on the\r\npeople of Europe, by the romance of Foersch, on the subject of the upas,\r\nor celebrated poison-tree of Java, may at this time be in a great\r\nmeasure superfluous, as the world has long ceased to be the dupe of his\r\nstory, and as regular series of experiments have been instituted both in\r\nEngland and in France, to ascertain the nature and potency of the\r\npoison; yet an authentic account of this poison, as drawn out by Doctor\r\nHorsfield, and given in the seventh volume of the Batavian transactions,\r\ncan not fail to be interesting. Almost every one has heard of its\r\nfabulous history, which, from its extravagant nature, its susceptibility\r\nof poetical ornament, its alliance with the cruelties of a despotic\r\ngovernment, and the sparkling genius of Darwin, whose purpose it\r\nanswered to adopt and personify it as a malignant spirit, (in his “Loves\r\nof the Plants,”) has obtained almost equal currency with the wonders of\r\nthe Lernian hydra, or any other of the classic fictions of antiquity.\r\n\r\nAlthough, as Doctor Horsfield observes, the account published by\r\nFoersch, so far as relates to the situation of the poison-tree, to its\r\neffects on the surrounding country, and to the application said to have\r\nbeen made of the upas on criminals in different parts of the island,\r\nhas, as well as the description of the poisonous substance itself, and\r\nits mode of collection, been demonstrated to be an extravagant forgery;\r\nyet the existence of a tree in Java, from the sap of which a poison is\r\nprepared, equal in fatality, when thrown into the circulation, to the\r\nstrongest animal poisons hitherto known, is a fact which it is his\r\nobject to establish and illustrate. The tree which produces this poison\r\nis the _anchar_, and grows in the eastern extremity of the island. The\r\nwork of Rhumphius contains a long account of the upas, under the\r\ndenomination of _arbor toxicaria_. The tree does not grow in Ambonia,\r\nand his description was made from the information he obtained from\r\nMacassar. His figure was drawn from a branch of what is called the\r\nmale-tree, sent to him from the same place, and establishes the identity\r\nof the poison-tree of Macassar, and the other eastern islands, with the\r\n_anchar_ of Java. The simple sap of the _arbor toxicaria_ (according to\r\nRhumphius) is harmless, and requires the addition of several substances\r\nof the affinity of ginger, to render it active and mortal. In so far it\r\nagrees with the _anchar_, which, in its simple state, is supposed to be\r\ninert, and, before being employed as a poison, is subjected to a\r\nparticular preparation. Besides the true poison-tree, the upas of the\r\neastern islands, and the _anchar_ of the Javans, this island produces a\r\nshrub, which, as far as observations have hitherto been made, is\r\npeculiar to the same, and by a different mode of preparation, furnishes\r\na poison far exceeding the upas in violence. Its name is _chetik_; but\r\nthe genus to which it belongs has not yet been discovered or described.\r\n\r\nThe _anchar_ is one of the largest trees in the forests of Java. The\r\nstem is cylindrical, perpendicular, and rises completely naked to the\r\nhight of sixty, seventy, or eighty feet. It is covered with a whitish\r\nbark, slightly bursting in longitudinal furrows. Near the ground this\r\nbark is, in old trees, more than half an inch thick, and, upon being\r\nwounded, yields plentifully the milky juice from which the celebrated\r\npoison is prepared. A puncture or incision being made into the tree, the\r\njuice or sap appears oozing out, of a yellowish color from old trees;\r\nbut paler, or nearly white, from young ones; and when exposed to the\r\nair, its surface becomes brown. The consistence very much resembles\r\nmilk; but it is more thick and viscid. This sap is contained in the true\r\nbark, (or _cortex_,) which, when punctured, yields a considerable\r\nquantity, so that in a short time a cupful may be collected from a large\r\ntree. The inner bark (or _liber_) is of a close fibrous texture, like\r\nthat of the _morus papyrifera_, and, when separated from the other bark,\r\nand cleansed from the adhering particles, resembles a coarse piece of\r\nlinen. It has been worked into ropes, which are very strong; and the\r\npoorer class of people employ the inner bark of the younger trees, which\r\nis more easily prepared, for the purpose of making a coarse stuff, which\r\nthey wear in working in the fields. But it requires much bruising,\r\nwashing, and a long immersion, before it can be used; and, when it\r\nappears completely purified, persons wearing this dress, being exposed\r\nto rain, are affected with an intolerable itching, which renders it\r\ninsupportable. It appears from the account of the manner in which the\r\npoison is prepared, that the deleterious quality exists in the gum, a\r\nsmall portion of which still adhering, produces, when exposed to wet,\r\nthis irritating effect; and it is singular that this property of the\r\nprepared bark is known to the Javans in all places where the tree grows,\r\nwhile the preparation of a poison from its juice, which produces a\r\nmortal effect when introduced into the body by pointed weapons, is an\r\nexclusive art of the inhabitants of the eastern extremity of the island.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          THE PRAIRIE ON FIRE.\r\n\r\nOne of the most striking features in the geography of the Western\r\nstates, is the prairies, or natural meadows. These are immense plains,\r\noften stretching, in every direction, further than the eye can reach,\r\nentirely destitute of trees, and covered with grass and wild flowers.\r\nThese prairies cover a vast extent of country north of the Ohio and west\r\nof the Mississippi, affording pasturage to countless herds of the\r\nbuffalo, deer and other wild animals. When the grass has been dried and\r\nparched by the heat of summer, it sometimes takes fire, as represented\r\nin the cut above, and then a sea of flame is swept by the wind over\r\nthese vast plains, spreading, it is said, more swiftly than the fleetest\r\nhorse can run before it. In such cases, the only resort is, to pull up\r\nthe grass around one, and kindle on every side a counter-flame, which\r\nburning _outward_, in every direction, leaves the hunter or traveler in\r\na place of safety.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE PRAIRIE ON FIRE.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                    THE MAMMOTH TREE OF CALIFORNIA.\r\n\r\nOne of the vegetable wonders of the world, is the immense tree\r\ndiscovered, a year or two since, in California. The first reports\r\nconcerning this huge giant of the forest seemed fabulous, so\r\nextraordinary were the particulars; but it is found that the largest\r\nstatement did not exceed the truth. The tree is a cedar, of the species\r\ncalled _arbor vitæ_, and was first discovered by some miners in the\r\nmountains of Calaveras, California, in a forest called the Redwoods, on\r\nTrinidad bay, some twenty or thirty miles from the mouth of Klamath\r\nriver, on the northern sea-coast of the state, a region that has been\r\nbut very little explored. A correspondent of the Sonora Herald, who\r\nrecently made an excursion to see it, thus describes it. “At the ground\r\nits circumference was ninety-two feet; four feet above that, it was\r\neighty-eight; and ten feet above that, it was sixty-one feet in\r\ncircumference; and the tapering of the shaft was very gradual. Its\r\nhight, to the end of the trunk, is two hundred and eighty-five feet; or,\r\nif we include the topmost branches, three hundred and twenty-five feet.\r\nThis tree is by no means a deformity, as most trees with large trunks\r\nare. It is throughout one of perfect symmetry, while its enormous\r\nproportions are inseparable concomitants of its grandeur. I have said\r\nthat this is the largest tree yet discovered in the world. It is so. The\r\ncelebrated tree of Fremont would have to grow many centuries before it\r\ncould pretend to be called anything but a younger brother. It is said\r\nthat a tree was once found in Senegal, in Africa, whose trunk measured\r\nninety feet in circumference. But nobody has been able to find it since\r\nits first discovery. There is a tree in Mexico called the _taxodium_,\r\nwhich is said to be one hundred and seventeen feet in circumference, but\r\nthis is said to be formed by the union of several trees. The hight of\r\nall these foreign trees is not more, in any case, than seventy feet; and\r\nnone of the trunks are more than ten feet. The age of this mammoth cedar\r\nof California, if each zone may be reckoned one year, is about\r\ntwenty-five hundred and twenty years. A section of the wood which I\r\nbrought home with me, exclusive of the sap, which is only about one inch\r\nthick, numbers about fourteen zones or grains to the inch. At that rate,\r\nif it were permitted to grow, it would increase its diameter one-seventh\r\nof an inch every year. In eighty-four years its diameter would be\r\nincreased one foot; in eight hundred and forty years, ten feet; and in\r\ntwenty-five hundred and twenty years, it would be forty feet in\r\ndiameter, and one hundred and twenty in circumference.\r\n\r\n“It seems like an act of desecration to cut down such a noble tree, such\r\na magnificent specimen of the growth of the primeval forest. But it has\r\nbeen done, not, however, without a vast deal of labor. It was\r\naccomplished by first boring holes through the body with long augers,\r\nworked by machinery, and afterward sawing from one to the other. Of\r\ncourse, as the sawing drew to a close, the workmen were on the alert to\r\nnotice the first sign of toppling, but none came; the tree was so\r\nstraight and evenly balanced on all sides that it retained its upright\r\nposition after it had been sawed through. Wedges were then forced in,\r\nand a breeze happening to spring up, over went the monster with a crash\r\nwhich was heard for miles around. The bark was stripped from it for the\r\nlength of fifty feet from the base, and is from one to two feet in\r\nthickness. It was taken off in sections, so that it can be placed,\r\nrelatively, in its original position, and thus give the beholder a just\r\nidea of the gigantic dimensions of the tree. So placed, it will occupy a\r\nspace of about thirty feet in diameter, or ninety feet in circumference,\r\nand fifty feet in hight. A piece of the wood will be shown, which has\r\nbeen cut out from the tree across the whole diameter. We are told that\r\nthis piece of wood shows a vestige of bark near the middle, and that\r\nthis bark was evidently charred many centuries ago, when the tree was\r\ncomparatively a sapling.”\r\n\r\nSince the above was written, the section of this huge tree alluded to,\r\nhas been exhibited in Stockton and San Francisco, and thence brought to\r\nthe United States, so that some of our readers may be able to get a view\r\nof this monster of the California woods for a trifling admission fee. In\r\nits natural condition, rearing its majestic head toward heaven, and\r\nwaving in all its native vigor, strength and verdure, it was a sight\r\nworth a pilgrimage to see; and it will still be a rich gratification to\r\nlook upon the section of it, though that will give but a faint idea of\r\nwhat the whole was in its native forest.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the calculation given above by the writer in the Sonora\r\nHerald, it is supposed that this tree can not be less than three\r\nthousand years old; for, for a large space on the outer surface next to\r\nthe bark, the rings of growth are so thin as not to be distinguishable\r\nfrom each other. Add one-third to the hight of Bunker-hill monument, and\r\nthe outward dimensions of the main trunk of this tree would be about the\r\nsame. From actual measurement it contained more than three hundred cords\r\nof wood. One hundred men could easily stand within the hollow of it at\r\nthe same time, and a six-foot man rode a full-sized horse through it\r\nwithout touching his hat to the upper surface.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          OTHER MAMMOTH TREES.\r\n\r\nA California paper says, that in the neighborhood of the mammoth tree\r\njust described, within a circumference of half a mile, there are twelve\r\nimmense trees, which rival, or even surpass that huge giant of the\r\nforest. One of these is called the Father Pine. This is dead, and has\r\nfallen to the earth. Its dimensions are as follows: length, four hundred\r\nfeet; circumference, one hundred and ten feet. The trunk of this tree is\r\nhollow, and it has been traced for a distance of two hundred and fifty\r\nfeet. There is a little pond of water in the center of this cavity, four\r\nfeet in depth. This tree, two hundred and fifty feet from the stump, is\r\nno less than twelve feet in diameter. The cluster called the Three\r\nSisters, taken together, is ninety-two feet in circumference, and three\r\nhundred feet in hight. The center one is bare of branches for two\r\nhundred feet above the ground. The Mother Tree is ninety-one and a half\r\nfeet in circumference, and three hundred and twenty-five feet high. The\r\nMother and Son are ninety-two feet in circumference and three hundred\r\nfeet in hight, united at the base. The Twin Sisters, one hundred feet in\r\ncircumference and three hundred feet in hight. The Pioneer’s Cabin is a\r\nremarkable curiosity. This tree has been partially burned; the result of\r\nthe scorching is the dividing of the trunk into several compartments,\r\nwhich are known as the parlor, bedroom and kitchen. The hollow, which is\r\ntwo hundred feet in hight, is called the chimney. This tree is\r\neighty-five feet in circumference. The Siamese Twins is ninety feet in\r\ncircumference, three hundred and twenty-five feet in hight. Guardian of\r\nthe Times, eighty-five feet in circumference, three hundred and\r\ntwenty-five feet in hight. Uncle Tom’s Cabin, ninety-four feet in\r\ncircumference, three hundred feet in hight. Pride of the Forest,\r\neighty-seven feet in circumference, three hundred feet in hight. Beauty\r\nof the Forest, seventy-two feet in circumference, three hundred feet in\r\nhight. Two Friends, eighty-five feet in circumference, three hundred\r\nfeet in hight. The above trees are all embraced in an area not exceeding\r\nhalf a mile in extent. The surrounding country is exceedingly\r\npicturesque and beautiful, and the scenery, at many points along the\r\nroad, is said to be unsurpassed for sublimity and grandeur.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             THE PALM-TREE.\r\n\r\nPassing from California to the countries of the east, let us next glance\r\nat the palm-tree. This tree, which is called by Linnæus, from its noble\r\nand stately appearance, “the prince of the vegetable kingdom,” is of\r\nseveral kinds, the chief of which are the doum-palm, and the date-palm.\r\nThey are chiefly found in the tropics. The doum or Theban palm, the same\r\nthat is found in Florida, differs from the columnar date-palm in the\r\nform of its leaves, which are fan-like, and so thickly set as to\r\nresemble a huge bushy mop, though they are always gracefully disposed,\r\nand also in having a branching trunk. The main stem divides a few feet\r\nfrom the root, each of the branches again forming two, and each of these\r\ntwo more, till the tree receives a broad, rounded top. The fruit hangs\r\nbelow in clusters, resembling small cocoa-nuts, (or, says a late\r\ntraveler, still more of the size, shape, and appearance of a\r\nyellowish-white potato, of full growth,) and has a sort of gingerbread\r\nflavor, which is not disagreeable. When fully dry and hard, it takes a\r\npolish like ivory, and is manufactured by the Arabs into beads,\r\npipe-bowls and other small articles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE DATE-PALM.]\r\n\r\nThe more common, or date-palm, a view of which is given in the cut,\r\nproduces the sweet fruit which is brought to us from Smyrna, and other\r\nports of the Mediterranean, with which all are familiar, under the name\r\nof the date. In the regions between Barbary and the great desert, the\r\nsoil, which is of a sandy nature, is so much parched by the intense heat\r\nof the sun’s rays, that none of the corn-plants will grow; and in the\r\narid district, called the _land of dates_, the few vegetables that can\r\nbe found are of the most dwarfish description. No plants arise to form\r\nthe variety of food to which we are accustomed; and the natives of these\r\ndistricts live almost exclusively upon the fruit of the date-tree. A\r\npaste is made of this fruit by pressing it in large baskets. This paste\r\nis not used for present supply, but is intended for a provision in case\r\nof a failure in the crops of dates, which sometimes occurs, owing to the\r\nravages committed by locusts. The date, in its natural state, forms the\r\nusual food; and the juice yielded by it when fresh, contains so much\r\nnutriment as to render those who live upon it extremely fat. As, by the\r\nMoors, corpulence is esteemed an indispensable requisite of beauty, the\r\nladies belonging to the families of distinction among them, nourish\r\nthemselves, during the season, solely with the fresh fruit, and by\r\ncontinuing this regimen during two or three months, they become of an\r\nenormous size! The date-palm flourishes very generally on sandy soils in\r\nthe hot countries of Asia and Africa. Not always, however, is the soil\r\nthat supports it so barren as the one we have described. It is\r\nfrequently found by streams, and as the tired traveler sees its foliage\r\nwaving afar, he hastens toward it, hoping to find a stream of water.\r\nSometimes its tall stem is surrounded by beautiful climbing plants, and\r\nthe most brilliant flowers flourish beneath. This kind of palm not only\r\nrises to a great hight, often sixty or eighty feet, but is also\r\nfrequently of great diameter and strength; being unlike in this respect,\r\nsome other species of palm, whose slight forms yield to the winds. It\r\nwas to this tree that the psalmist alluded when he said, “The righteous\r\nshall grow as the palm-tree;” firm and unmoved by the shocks of\r\ntemptation and the storms of adversity.\r\n\r\nThe clusters of dates are sometimes five feet in length, and when ripe\r\nare of a bright gold color, surrounded from above with the deep, rich\r\nleaves, as with a crown. This kind of the palm is trained to its high\r\ngrowth, without a single branch on its solitary, upright trunk, by\r\ntrimming off the leaves every year from the young stalk; so that its\r\nstrength shoots upward; and by this process, also, the bark is formed\r\ninto a succession of steps or notches, by which the barefooted Arab\r\neasily mounts to the top. From the very top of the tree, the long,\r\npointed leaves curl gracefully on every side, like the close-set frame\r\nof a parachute; and just where the broad, ridge-shaped base of the leaf\r\nadheres to the tree, the fruit hangs in clusters, all around the trunk.\r\nWhen its early training is neglected, the palm-tree grows less\r\ngracefully; sometimes dividing at the root into several trunks, which\r\ngrow without branches to various hights, and then spread out their leafy\r\ncrests. The palm-tree looks most majestic and picturesque, when it\r\nstands alone upon some broad plain or gentle bluff, and when its leaves\r\nare gently stirred by the wind. The eye then takes it in at one view,\r\nmeasures it by some mental standard, or disdaining all mathematical\r\nproportions, dreamily contemplates the waving lines of beauty, and the\r\nstraight, slender, yet stately stalk that stands in bold relief against\r\nthe stainless sky. The date-palm is unknown in the United States, except\r\nin rare garden culture; but in Egypt it grows everywhere, and is to the\r\npeople food, shelter, shade, fuel, raiment, timber, divan, cordage,\r\nbasket, roof, screen. Its fruit is found in perfection on the confines\r\nof Nubia.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            THE BAMBOO-TREE.\r\n\r\nNature, or rather the great Author of nature, has conferred on the\r\ninhabitants of hot countries few gifts more valuable than the\r\nbamboo-tree, a view of which is given over the leaf. To such a multitude\r\nof useful purposes are its light, strong and graceful stems applied,\r\nthat almost any other production of the vegetable world might more\r\neasily be spared than this. These stems spring from a strong-jointed,\r\nsubterraneous root-stalk, which is the trunk of the tree, the shoots\r\nbeing the branches. They are hollow, and jointed, and of a hard, woody\r\ntexture, the outside being coated with silex, and the inside consisting\r\nof a close, fibrous and very hard wood. The bamboo grows with great\r\nrapidity; and the shoots, when quite young, are sometimes cut and boiled\r\nlike asparagus: but when full grown and vigorous, it becomes a large and\r\nstrong tree. Its shoots vary in size, from six to one hundred and fifty\r\nfeet in length. When fully grown, the bamboo is a straight rod, bearing\r\na number of stiff branches, which shoot at nearly right angles from the\r\nmain stem. It seems, at first, difficult to imagine how such a stem\r\nelevates itself through the dense mass of rigid branches, which cross\r\neach other in every direction. This is, however, arranged in a very\r\nsimple manner. The young shoot, when it is first produced, is nothing\r\nbut a sucker, as already said, like a shoot of asparagus; but, having a\r\nsharp point, it easily pierces the dense and overhanging branches. It is\r\nonly when it has arrived at its full length, and has penetrated through\r\nall obstacles, that it forms its lateral shoots, which readily interpose\r\nthemselves amid the stems. There are many species of the bamboo, all of\r\nwhich are useful. The young shoots, as mentioned above, are sometimes\r\neaten as food; the full-grown stems, when ripe and hard, are converted\r\ninto bows, arrows, quivers, fishing-rods, masts of vessels, bed-posts,\r\nwalking-sticks, floors, supporters of rustic bridges, chairs, and a\r\nvariety of other purposes. By notching their sides, the Malays form\r\nwonderfully light ladders. Bruised and crushed in water, the leaves and\r\nstems form Chinese paper; some species are used for lining tea-chests;\r\ncut into lengths, and the partitions knocked out, they form durable\r\nwater-pipes. Slit into strips, they form excellent materials for weaving\r\nmats, baskets, window-blinds, and even the sails of boats. It is,\r\nhowever, for the purposes of building, that the bamboo is most\r\nimportant. The frame-work of the houses in Sumatra is chiefly composed\r\nof this material. The floors are made of the whole canes, laid close to\r\neach other. The sides are made of the stems, split and flattened, and\r\nthe roof is formed of a thatch split into various strips. Great hopes\r\nare entertained of introducing this most useful tree into other\r\ncountries; and, as it grows in dry and stony places, where nothing else\r\nflourishes, its introduction would be of great importance. A few species\r\nof the bamboo are found in the tropical parts of America.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE BAMBOO-TREE.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                            THE MANNA-TREE.\r\n\r\nManna, in our version of the Bible, is a term applied to the food that\r\nGod gave the Israelites in the wilderness. But what we now call manna,\r\nis a saccharine substance that exudes from the bark of a species of\r\nash-tree found in the southern parts of Europe, and especially in Sicily\r\nand Calabria. At the warmest season, the tree most abounds in sap, and,\r\naccordingly, in August, the people make incisions into the bark. These\r\nare two inches long horizontally, and half an inch in depth. On\r\nincision, the manna immediately begins to flow, at first in the form of\r\nwater, but it gradually becomes thicker. A leaf is inserted into the\r\nincision, which conducts the juice into a vessel placed at the foot of\r\nthe tree. The liquor does not harden till it has remained some time. It\r\nhas an unpleasant taste, but after the watery parts have evaporated, it\r\nis sweeter, but slightly nauseous. Manna is used in medicine as a mild\r\naperient. It differs remarkably from common sugar, in not being\r\nsusceptible of what is called vinous fermentation; so that if mixed with\r\ncommon sugar and yeast, and subjected to the process of fermentation,\r\nwhile the sugar is converted into alcohol, the manna remains unaltered\r\nin the liquor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Continental Money]\r\n\r\n\r\n                           CONTINENTAL MONEY.\r\n\r\nOne of the curiosities, if not wonders of the world, is afforded in the\r\nContinental money, or Continental bills, issued by congress in the early\r\nstages of the Revolutionary struggle, a specimen of which may be seen in\r\nthe cut. These bills were of various denominations, and were issued by\r\nthousands on thousands. But from the very great extent of their issue,\r\nand the fact that the government could not redeem them in silver and\r\ngold, they rapidly depreciated in value, till at last they became almost\r\nworthless. As they are now almost never seen, except it be in some\r\nmuseum, or collection of old curiosities, the _fac-simile_ given above\r\ncan not fail to be of interest.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             THE MILK-TREE.\r\n\r\nThat singular production of nature called the _masseranduba_, or\r\nmilk-tree, is found in the tropical regions of South America, and is\r\nthus described by Wallace, in his “Travels on the Amazon.” Speaking of\r\nthe various interesting objects of the journey he was making, he says:\r\n“What most interested us, however, were several large logs of the\r\n_masseranduba_, or milk-tree. On our way through the forest, we had seen\r\nsome trunks much notched by persons who had been extracting the milk. It\r\nis one of the noblest trees of the forest, rising with a straight stem\r\nto an enormous hight. The timber is very hard, fine-grained, and\r\ndurable, and is valuable for works which are much exposed to the\r\nweather. The fruit is eatable and very good, the size of a small apple,\r\nand full of a rich and very juicy pulp. But strangest of all is the\r\nvegetable milk, which exudes in abundance when the bark is cut. It has\r\nabout the consistence of thick cream, and, but for a very slight\r\npeculiar taste, could scarcely be distinguished from the genuine product\r\nof the cow. Mr. Leavens ordered a man to tap some logs that had lain\r\nnearly a month in the yard. He cut several notches in the bark with an\r\nax, and in a minute the rich sap was running out in great quantities. It\r\nwas collected in a basin, diluted with water, strained, and brought up\r\nat tea-time, and at breakfast next morning. The peculiar flavor of the\r\nmilk seemed rather to improve the quality of the tea, and gave it as\r\ngood a color as rich cream. In coffee it is equally good. Mr. Leavens\r\ninformed us that he had made a custard of it, and that, though it had a\r\ncurious dark color, it was very well tasted. The milk is used for glue,\r\nand is said to be as durable as that made use of by carpenters. As a\r\nspecimen of its capabilities in this line, Mr. Leavens showed us a\r\nviolin he had made, the belly-board of which, formed of two pieces, he\r\nhad glued together with it applied fresh from the tree, without any\r\npreparation. It had been done two years. The instrument had been in\r\nconstant use; and the joint was now perfectly good and sound throughout\r\nits whole length. As the milk hardens by exposure to air, it becomes a\r\nvery tough, slightly elastic substance, much resembling gutta percha;\r\nbut not having the property of being softened by hot water, it is not\r\nlikely to become so extensively useful as that article.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                             THE TELEGRAPH.\r\n\r\nTho old-fashioned telegraph, which was in common use before the\r\nwonderful invention of the electro-magnetic telegraph by Morse, was an\r\narrangement for the communication of intelligence by signals, or\r\nmovements, previously agreed upon; which signals represented letters,\r\nwords, or ideas, which could thus be transmitted from one station to\r\nanother, as far as the signals could be seen. It was first devised in\r\nFrance, about 1793 or 1794, and soon became extensively adopted and used\r\nin other nations. A good idea of its appearance may be formed from the\r\ncut below. It consisted of a mast, or frame, in connection with\r\nshutters, or sliding-boards, worked by ropes pulled like bell-ropes, and\r\nexhibiting, in all, sixty-three signals; by which were represented the\r\nnine digits, the letters of the alphabet, and several generic words:\r\nand, sometimes, to these were added other signals, expressive of entire\r\nphrases. The observers at these telegraphs were not expected to keep\r\ntheir eye constantly at the glass, but to look only every five minutes\r\nfor the signal to make ready. The telescopes used for observation, were\r\ncommonly what are called Dolland’s achromatics, which possess no\r\nrecommendation but their enlarged field, and their freedom from\r\nprismatic colors in that field; points of no consequence in looking\r\nthrough a fixed glass at a fixed and circumscribed object. Sometimes a\r\ncommon and powerful spy-glass was found sufficient. In the use of this\r\nkind of telegraph, dead flats or levels were found to be universally\r\nunfavorable; and generally stations were found to be useless nearly in\r\nthe proportion of the miles of dead flat looked over. On the contrary,\r\nstations between hill and hill, looking across a valley, or a series of\r\nvalleys, were found to be mostly clear; and water surfaces were found to\r\nproduce fewer obscure days than land in any situation. The period least\r\nfavorable of the same day was an hour or two before and after the sun’s\r\npassage of the meridian, particularly on dead levels, where the play of\r\nthe sun’s rays on the rising exhalations, renders distant vision\r\nexceedingly obscure. The tranquillity of the morning and evening were\r\nascertained to be the most favorable hours for observation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SIGNAL TELEGRAPH.]\r\n\r\nThe old line of this kind of telegraph between London and Portsmouth,\r\nhad twelve stations; and another chain from London to Yarmouth, had\r\nnineteen stations. The distances of the stations averaged about eight\r\nmiles, yet some of them extended to twelve or fourteen; and the lines\r\nwere often increased by circuits, for want of commanding hights. After\r\nabout twenty years’ experience, they found they could calculate on about\r\ntwo hundred days on which signals could be transmitted throughout the\r\nday; about sixty others on which they could pass only part of the day,\r\nor at particular stations; and about one hundred days in which few of\r\nthe stations were visible to each other. A message from London to\r\nPortsmouth, was usually transmitted in about fifteen minutes; but, by an\r\nexperiment tried for the purpose, a single signal has been transmitted\r\nto Plymouth and back again in _three minutes_, which, by the telegraph\r\nroute, is at least five hundred miles. In this instance, however, notice\r\nhad been given to make ready, and every captain was at his post to\r\nreceive and return the signals. The progress was at the rate of one\r\nhundred and seventy miles in a minute, or three miles a second, or three\r\nseconds at each station; a rapidity truly wonderful for so imperfect an\r\napparatus! And yet, clumsy and slow-moving as all this now seems to us,\r\nit was the best telegraph known before the invention of Morse. In\r\ncontrast to it, let us turn to the latter.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    THE ELECTRO-MAGNETIC TELEGRAPH.\r\n\r\nThe invention of this wonderful instrument, it is now universally\r\nadmitted, is due to Professor S. F. B. Morse, of whom some one has well\r\nsaid, that “_if Franklin brought the lightning from heaven, Morse both\r\ntamed it, and taught it the English language_.” So early as 1822, Mr.\r\nMorse described his invention to reliable witnesses; and having obtained\r\nan appropriation from Congress, for the purpose of testing it on an\r\nextended scale, he set up the wires from Washington to Baltimore, a\r\ndistance of about forty miles, and thus established the first\r\nelectro-magnetic telegraph ever known, and the parent of that wonderful\r\nsystem that now threads every continent, conveying messages literally on\r\nthe lightning’s wing. A view of the instrument used for transmitting\r\nmessages, is given in the cut below. By this instrument connecting with\r\nthe wires, messages are either written or printed; by the system of\r\nHouse, in actual letters, and by the systems of Morse and Bain, in a\r\ncipher.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ELECTRO-MAGNETIC TELEGRAPH.]\r\n\r\nThe telegraphic wires having been extended throughout the United States\r\nand the continent of Europe, it is now proposed to carry them _under the\r\nAtlantic_, and so connect America and Europe. The plan now is, to carry\r\nthe cable from the northernmost point of the Highlands of Scotland to\r\nIceland, by way of the Orkney, Shetland and Ferroe islands; to lay it\r\nfrom Iceland across to the nearest point in Greenland, thence down the\r\ncoast to Cape Farewell, where the cable would again take to the water,\r\nspan Davis’s straits, and then go across Labrador and Upper Canada to\r\nQuebec. Here it would lock in with the North American meshwork of wires,\r\nwhich hold themselves out like an open hand for the European grasp. This\r\nplan seems quite feasible, for in no part of the journey would the cable\r\nrequire to be more than nine hundred miles long; and as it seems pretty\r\ncertain that a sand-bank extends, with good soundings, all the way to\r\nCape Farewell, there would be little difficulty in mooring the cable to\r\na level and soft bottom.\r\n\r\nAmong the most startling wonders in connection with electricity and the\r\ntelegraph, is the announcement that M. Bonelli, of Turin, has invented a\r\nnew electric telegraph, by which trains _in motion_ on a railway are\r\nenabled to communicate with each other at all rates of velocity, and, at\r\nthe same time, with the telegraphic stations on the line; while the\r\nlatter are, at the same time, able to communicate with the trains. It is\r\nadded, that M. Bonelli is in possession of a system of telegraphic\r\ncommunication by which wires are entirely dispensed with.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          THE ART OF PRINTING.\r\n\r\nFrom the telegraph, to printing, and the printing-press, is but a step;\r\nand one that is naturally suggested. The origin of printing is involved\r\nin mystery. Some think it was practiced as far back as the building of\r\nBabylon. The Romans, we know, had metal stamps with which they marked\r\nwords and names on their various articles; but having no paper, they\r\ncould hardly be said to _print_. Printing from engraved blocks of wood,\r\nwas practiced by the Chinese nearly fifty years before the Christian\r\nera. But the credit of first introducing movable types, is commonly\r\nattributed to John Fust, or Faust, of Mentz, who is represented, in the\r\ncut on the next page, as looking, with his associates, at the first\r\nproof taken from movable types. This was supposed to be not far from the\r\nyear 1450. Between 1450 and 1455, the celebrated “Mentz Bible” appeared,\r\nwithout date; and this was the occasion of the art being discovered by\r\nthe public. Next followed the “Psalter,” in 1457; and from this time,\r\nprinting rapidly spread throughout Europe. William Caxton was the first\r\nto introduce printing into England, about 1474. The first book in which\r\nGreek types appear, was printed in 1465; and the first using the Roman\r\ncharacter, in 1467.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FAUST TAKING FIRST PROOF FROM MOVABLE TYPES.]\r\n\r\nPrinting-presses were gradually improved. The old-fashioned press was\r\nmade of wood, with an iron screw that had a bar fitted in it; and to the\r\nlower end of this screw was attached, horizontally, a flat piece of\r\nwood, called the _platen_, which was brought down by means of the screw,\r\nand pressed the paper on the face of the types, and thus the impression\r\nwas given. This kind of presses, however, soon gave place to those made\r\nof iron. The Stanhope press was a great improvement on anything that had\r\ngone before it; and the Caledonian press, invented by George Clymer, an\r\nAmerican, was a great improvement, in many respects, on the latter. The\r\npress represented in the cut on the following page, on which Franklin\r\nprinted, was one of these old-fashioned hand-presses, on which it would\r\nhave been a hard day’s work to print twenty-five hundred impressions, or\r\ntwelve hundred and fifty sheets on both sides, in a day. After a time, a\r\nplan was devised of obtaining impressions from types by means of\r\ncylinders; and in 1804, the idea was started, of applying steam-power to\r\nprinting-presses. It was not, however, till after years of experiments,\r\nand an immense outlay of capital, that the invention was brought to a\r\nsuccessful issue, so as to be advantageously applied in practice. When,\r\nhowever, in 1814, the machine was completed, it was adopted in the\r\noffice of the London Times newspaper, and was thus spoken of in the\r\npapers of the day.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FRANKLIN’S PRINTING-PRESS.]\r\n\r\n“A new printing-press, or printing-engine, has recently excited the\r\nattention of the typographical world. It is wrought by the power of\r\nsteam, and, with the aid of three boys, perfects nearly a thousand\r\nsheets per hour. A common press, worked by two men, takes off but two\r\nhundred and fifty impressions on one side, and requires eight hours to\r\n_perfect_ a thousand sheets. Hence, three boys in one hour are enabled,\r\nby this new application of the power of steam, to perform the labor of\r\ntwo men for eight hours. Such are the present capabilities of this\r\nengine: but as there is no limit to its required powers, and the size of\r\nthe _form_ is no obstacle to its perfect performance, it is proposed to\r\ntake impressions on double-demy, in which case three boys will, in one\r\nhour, perform the labor of thirty-two men. This engine is now at work at\r\nthe printing-office of Bensley & Sons, near Fleet street, and another on\r\na similar (but less perfect) construction, has for some time past been\r\nemployed on a morning newspaper. In its general analogy, this press is\r\nnot unlike the rolling-press of copper-plate printers. The forms being\r\nfixed on the _carriage_, are drawn under a cylinder, on which the sheet\r\nbeing laid, and the ink distributed by an arrangement of rollers, the\r\nimpression is taken on one side. The sheet is then conveyed off by bands\r\nto a second cylinder, around which it is conveyed on the _second form_,\r\nand the _reiteration_ is produced in _perfect register_, without the aid\r\nof _points_. All the manual labor is performed by a boy, who lays the\r\nsheet of paper on the first cylinder, by one who takes it off from the\r\nsecond cylinder, and by a third, who lays the sheets even on the _bank_.\r\nAs a further instance of economy in the materials, we may mention, that\r\nthe waste steam from the copper is carried in tubes round the entire\r\nsuit of offices, with a view to warm them.”\r\n\r\nPassing on, over various improvements, we come, last of all, to what\r\nthus far is the perfection of all printing-machines, _viz._, _Hoe’s\r\neight-cylinder power-press_, a view of which is given in the cut on the\r\nfollowing page. This immense printing-machine is thirty-three feet long,\r\nfourteen feet and eight inches high, and six feet wide. It has one large\r\ncentral cylinder on which the type is secured, and eight smaller\r\ncylinders arranged around it, at convenient distances. Eight persons\r\nsupply the eight small cylinders with the sheets, and at each revolution\r\nof the large cylinder, eight impressions are given off, the sheets being\r\ndelivered in neat order by the machine itself. The limit to the speed is\r\nin the ability of the eight persons to supply the sheets. At the rate of\r\ntwenty-five hundred sheets to each, the press would give off the\r\nunparalleled number of twenty thousand printed impressions per hour. The\r\npress is thus far used exclusively for newspaper and similar printing.\r\nWhat it may next be applied to, or what will be the next stride in the\r\nrapidity and perfection of printing, only the future can reveal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOE’S EIGHT-CYLINDER POWER-PRESS.]\r\n\r\nBefore leaving the subject of printing, it may not be uninteresting to\r\nmention, that a _composing_, or type-setting machine, is said to have\r\nbeen recently invented, in Denmark. One who has seen it in operation,\r\nsays: “It is now in actual operation in the office of the Fædrelandet.\r\nInstead of the usual cases and composing-sticks, and the compositor\r\nstanding at his work, we see a person sitting before a machine with keys\r\nlike a piano, which he plays on incessantly, and every touch on the\r\ntangent is followed by a click; the letter already in its place in the\r\nlong mahogany channel prepared for it. The whole is excessively\r\ningenious. In fact it is fairy work. The most wonderful part is that it\r\ndistributes the already used types at the same time that it sets the new\r\npage, and with an exactness perfectly sure. No mistake can ever occur.\r\nThe compositor, by this machine, does four times as much work as another\r\nworkman; but as he requires an assistant to line and page the set type,\r\nthis brings it to twice the amount of type set. The whole is so clean\r\nand pleasant, that it will probably soon be a favorite employment for\r\nwomen. The machine occupies a very small space, not more than a large\r\nchair, and is beautifully made of hard woods, brass and steel. Its\r\nsuccess is now beyond all doubt. The proprietors of the Fædrelandet are\r\nso gratified by the one they now have, that they have ordered another.\r\nThe price is twenty-four hundred Danish dollars. It will last,\r\napparently, for a century or two without repair. Mr. Sorenson, the\r\ninventor, himself a compositor all his life, kindly shows the machine to\r\nany visitor. Of course, a compositor can not set with this machine at\r\nonce; it will take a short time, a few days, for him to become familiar\r\nwith the details, but he is then a gentleman compared to his old\r\ncomrades.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                         THE INDIA-RUBBER TREE.\r\n\r\nIndia-rubber, called, also, _caoutchouc_, is produced from several\r\ndifferent trees, all of them of the _ficus_, or fig species. The _ficus\r\nelasticus_ is the tree from which it is chiefly obtained. This is a\r\nnative both of India and of South America; and its general appearance\r\nmay be seen in the cut below. When the bark is cut or broken, it gives\r\nforth a milky liquid, which, being exposed to the air, produces the gum\r\nelastic which is so much in use among us. It is now about a hundred\r\nyears since it was first introduced into Europe. For a long time it was\r\nonly used to erase the marks of lead-pencils. The natives of South\r\nAmerica had, however, long employed it, as we do now, for boots and\r\nshoes. They also smear the inside of baskets with it, thus providing a\r\ntough and tight lining. In the vicinity of Quito, they make it into a\r\nkind of cloth. Its multiplied uses in the United States and Europe, are\r\nfamiliar to every reader. In a volume lately published in New York,\r\nentitled “Scenes and Adventures on the Banks of the Amazon,” is found\r\nthe following account of this singular and most useful tree.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE INDIA-RUBBER TREE.]\r\n\r\n“A number of blacks, bearing long poles on their shoulders, thickly\r\nstrung with India-rubber shoes, also attracted our attention. These are\r\nfor the most part manufactured in the interior, and are brought down the\r\nriver for sale by the natives. It has been estimated that at least two\r\nhundred and fifty thousand pairs of shoes are annually exported from the\r\nprovince, and the number is constantly increasing. A few words here\r\nrespecting the tree itself, and the manufacture of the shoes, may not be\r\nout of place. The tree is quite peculiar in its appearance, and\r\nsometimes reaches the hight of eighty and even a hundred feet. The trunk\r\nis perfectly round, rather smooth, and protected by a bark of a light\r\ncolor. The leaves grow in clusters of three together, are thin, and of\r\nan ovate form, and are from ten to fifteen inches in length. The center\r\nleaf of the cluster is always the longest. This remarkable tree bears a\r\ncurious fruit of the size of a peach, which, although not very\r\npalatable, is eagerly sought after by different animals. It is separated\r\ninto three lobes, which contain each a small black nut. The trees are\r\ntapped in the same manner that the New Englanders tap maple-trees; the\r\ntrunk having been perforated, a yellowish liquid, resembling cream,\r\nflows out, which is caught in small clay cups fastened to the tree. When\r\nthese become full, their contents are emptied into large earthen jars,\r\nin which the liquid is kept until desired for use. The operation of\r\nmaking the shoes is as simple as it is interesting. Imagine yourself in\r\none of the seringa groves of Brazil. Around you are a number of\r\ngood-looking natives of low stature and olive complexions. One is\r\nstirring, with a long wooden stick, the contents of a caldron, placed\r\nover a pile of blazing embers. This is the liquid as it was taken from\r\nthe rubber tree. Into this a wooden ‘last,’ covered with clay, and\r\nhaving a handle, is plunged. A coating of the liquid remains. Another\r\nnative then takes the ‘last,’ and holds it in the smoke arising from the\r\nignition of a species of palm fruit, for the purpose of causing the\r\nglutinous substance to assume a dark color. The ‘last’ is then plunged\r\nagain into the caldron, and this process is repeated as in dipping\r\ncandles, until the coating is of the required thickness. You will\r\nmoreover notice a number of Indian girls engaged in making various\r\nimpressions, such as flowers, &c., upon the soft surface of the rubber,\r\nby means of their thumb-nails, which are especially pared and cultivated\r\nfor that purpose. After this final operation, the shoes are placed in\r\nthe sun to harden, and large numbers of them may be seen laid out on\r\nmats in exposed situations. The aboriginal name of the rubber is\r\n_cahchu_, from which the formidable word of _caoutchouc_ is derived.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE OLD ROUND TOWER AT NEWPORT.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                      THE ROUND TOWER AT NEWPORT.\r\n\r\n“The tower”—“the old round tower”—“the old stone tower,” at Newport,\r\nRhode Island, if not one of the wonders of the world, has at least\r\nexcited wonder enough in some of its inhabitants, and been a monument of\r\ndeep interest to the traveler, the antiquarian, the controversialist,\r\nand the poet. Its appearance may be seen in the cut below, which is\r\ntaken from a drawing made on the spot. For a long time it was the\r\nprevailing belief, that it was built by the Northmen, who, it was\r\nsupposed, coasted along the New England shores as early as the twelfth\r\ncentury. Even the society of Danish antiquaries, gravely came to this\r\nconclusion, from some drawings and accounts that were sent them; and the\r\ndiscovery of a “skeleton in armor,” on the main land, near Newport, gave\r\ncurrency to this impression. Later investigations, however, have settled\r\nthe point that it was originally built _for a windmill_, about 1676. It\r\nis about seventy-five feet above high-water level in the harbor, and\r\nabout one hundred and twenty rods from the shore. Thus has been\r\ndissipated the foundation of many a wild theory, and many a joyous hoax\r\nof other days.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SUBMARINE OR DIVING ARMOR.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                             DIVING ARMOR.\r\n\r\nThe mention of the India-rubber tree, on a previous page, suggests the\r\napplication of the valuable substance derived from it, to one of its\r\nmany important uses, _viz._, to the _submarine_ or _diving armor_. This\r\nis represented in the cut below, where the diver, or person about to\r\ndescend into the sea, is seen encased with a water-proof dress, made\r\nchiefly of India rubber. His feet are heavily loaded with boots which\r\nhave soles made of thick plates of lead. On his head is a helmet-shaped\r\ncovering, made of iron, from which rises a hose, through which fresh air\r\nis forced to him, by powerful air-pumps, when he is under the water.\r\nThis helmet, which is well padded, is furnished with two glass eyes,\r\nwhich are protected by wire gratings. Around the waist is a strong\r\ngirdle provided with iron rings, one on each side, from which ascend\r\ncords to the persons in the boat from which the diver descends, for the\r\npurpose not only of aiding to guide him over the rocks, and helping him\r\nto an upright position, but to serve for signalizing in case of sudden\r\ndanger or accident, and as a means of hauling him up when required. Thus\r\nalthough the diver is at perfect liberty to direct his own movements, he\r\nis still held in leading-strings from the boat, and all his motions are\r\nvigilantly watched and cared for by his companions above. To aid him in\r\nkeeping under water, the diver also wears two heavy plates of lead, one\r\nin front and the other behind, which are so adjusted as to leave his\r\narms at liberty, and at the same time give equilibrium to his submerged\r\nbody. In this case, he also has a bag in front, into which he may put\r\nvaluables of small size picked up in the deep, such, for example, as\r\npearls, or amber, both of which have been sought for by persons thus\r\nequipped.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MANNER OF WORKING THE DIVING ARMOR.]\r\n\r\nThe method of exploring with this armor, is seen in the second cut,\r\nwhere the diver is represented as below the water, while his companions\r\nare in the boat above, some of them holding the ropes, some pumping down\r\nair, and others holding the ladder, while the diver himself is picking\r\nup some object of value from the bottom of the sea. This armor has been\r\nused in searching for amber, pearls, lost treasure, &c., &c. And when,\r\nsome years since, the United States steam-frigate Missouri was sunk in\r\nGibraltar harbor, so as to obstruct navigation, and all attempts by\r\ndistinguished English engineers to raise her had proved in vain, an\r\nAmerican, going down in the above-described armor, explored her\r\nposition, and then contracted to blow her to pieces, which he\r\nsuccessfully accomplished, though she was in twenty-six feet water, and\r\ncovered by fifteen feet of sand. In doing this, he consumed forty-three\r\nthousand pounds of powder, raised sixteen hundred tuns of iron, and some\r\neight hundred tuns of oysters that had grown to the iron. All his men\r\nwere clothed in the submarine armor, and so perfect was the management,\r\nthat not a life was lost, and not an accident happened during the whole\r\nof the operation.\r\n\r\nIn this connection, the recently invented “Nautilus diving-bell” is\r\nworthy of notice. This bell is provided with air-tight compartments,\r\nwhich hold either air or water, as ascent or descent is required: and is\r\nso ballasted that, when filled with water, buoyancy is destroyed, and\r\nthe machine gradually sinks. Expel the water from the tanks, and the\r\nmachine comes of course at once to the surface. By opening a valve near\r\nthe bottom of the bell, the water enters through a pipe into the tanks;\r\nthe air at the same time escaping through a valve at the top, opened or\r\nclosed by the operator at will. Descent is thus effected. On the\r\ncontrary, let air be turned into the tanks, escape at top be closed, and\r\nvalves at bottom opened, water is expelled and ascent secured. To raise\r\nheavy weights, a greater or less amount of water is expelled.\r\nSuspension-chains attached to weight, immediately tighten; machine and\r\nweight become buoyant, and then by cables attached to anchors working\r\nthrough stuffing-boxes, windlasses may be transported to any desired\r\nspot, and there deposited. Free communication may be held with the\r\nbottom through an opening of between twelve and fifty square feet,\r\naccording to size of bell, closed by an iron door, and secured by bolts.\r\nBy throwing the door back, an equilibrium between air and water may be\r\nattained at any depth, by greater or less amounts of air, as determined\r\nby suitable gauges permanently fastened in the bell. Such is the\r\ningenious mechanism of this wonderful contrivance.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        TREE-HOUSE IN CAFFRARIA.\r\n\r\nIn Caffraria, in Africa, there is an “inhabited tree,” which travelers\r\nthus describe: “It stands at the base of a range of mountains, due east\r\nfrom Kurrichaine, in a place called ‘Ongorutcie Fountain.’ Its gigantic\r\nlimbs contain seventeen conical huts. These are used as dwellings, being\r\nbeyond the reach of the lions, which, since the incursion of the\r\nMantates from the adjoining country, when so many thousands of persons\r\nwere massacred, have become very numerous in the neighborhood, and\r\ndestructive to human life. The branches of the tree are supported by\r\nforked sticks, or poles, and there are three tiers, or platforms, on\r\nwhich the huts are constructed. The lowest is nine feet from the ground,\r\nand holds ten huts; the second, about eight feet high, has three huts;\r\nand the upper story, if it may be so called, contains four. The ascent\r\nto these is made by notches cut in the supporting poles; and the huts\r\nare built with twigs, thatched with straw, and will contain ten persons,\r\nconveniently.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TREE-HOUSE IN CAFFRARIA.]\r\n\r\nA view of one of these trees is given in the cut on the previous page.\r\nOther villages have been seen by travelers, built somewhat similarly to\r\nthe above; but these were erected on stakes, instead of trees, about\r\neight feet above the ground, about forty feet square, larger in some\r\nplaces, and containing about seventy or eighty huts. The inhabitants sit\r\nunder the shade of these platforms during the day, and retire at night\r\nto the huts above.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           THE RAINING-TREE.\r\n\r\nThe island of Fierro is one of the most considerable of the Canaries,\r\nand some suppose its name to have been given upon this account: that its\r\nsoil, not affording so much as a drop of fresh water, seems to be of\r\niron; and, indeed, there is in this island neither rivulet, nor well,\r\nnor spring, save that only toward the seaside there are some wells; but\r\nthey lie at such a distance from the city, that the inhabitants can make\r\nno use thereof. But the great Preserver and Sustainer of all, remedies\r\nthis inconvenience by a way so extraordinary, that we can but sit down\r\nand acknowledge that he gives in this, undeniable demonstration of his\r\ngoodness and infinite providence. For in the midst of the island, says a\r\nlate traveler, there is a tree, which is the only one of the kind,\r\ninsomuch that it hath no resemblance to those mentioned by us in this\r\nrelation, nor to any other known to us in Europe. The leaves of it are\r\nlong and narrow, and continue in constant verdure, winter and summer;\r\nand its branches are covered with a cloud, which is never dispelled, but\r\nresolved into a moisture, causing to fall from its leaves a very clear\r\nwater, and that in such abundance, that the cisterns, which are placed\r\nat the foot of the tree to receive it, are never empty, but contain\r\nenough to supply both man and beast.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         THE TRAVELER’S FRIEND.\r\n\r\nSomewhat like the tree last mentioned, is one which is found in\r\nMadagascar, and which, from its property of yielding water, is called\r\n“the traveler’s friend.” It differs from most other trees in having all\r\nits branches in one plane, like the sticks of a fan or the feathers of a\r\npeacock’s tail. At the extremity of each branch grows a broad double\r\nleaf, several feet in length, which spreads itself out very gracefully.\r\nThese leaves radiate heat so rapidly after sunset, that a copious\r\ndeposition of dew takes place upon them, which, soon collecting into\r\ndrops, forms little streams, which run down the branches to the trunk.\r\nHere it is received into hollow spaces of considerable magnitude, one of\r\nwhich is found at the root of every branch. These branches lie one over\r\nthe other alternately, and when a knife, or, which is better, a flat\r\npiece of stick (for it is not necessary to cut the tree) is inserted\r\nbetween the parts which overlap, and slightly drawn to one side, so as\r\nto cause an opening, a stream of water gushes out as if from a fountain.\r\nHence the appropriate name of “the traveler’s friend.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CAMPHOR-TREE.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                           THE CAMPHOR-TREE.\r\n\r\nThe camphor-tree, a view of which is given in the cut below, grows\r\nnaturally in the woods of Japan, and in many of the islands of the far\r\ndistant Pacific ocean. The part which smells stronger of camphor than\r\nany other, is the root, which yields it in great quantities. The bark of\r\nthe stalk has outwardly rather a rough appearance; the inner surface is\r\nsmooth and mucous, and is very easily separated from the wood, which is\r\ndry in its nature, and white in its color. The leaves stand upon\r\nslender, delicate foot-stalks, having an entire undulating margin\r\nrunning out into a point; the upper surface of the leaf is of a lively,\r\nshining green, and the lower, herbaceous and silky. The flowers are\r\nproduced on the tops of footstalks, which proceed from the arm-pits of\r\nthe leaves, but not till the tree has attained considerable age and\r\nsize. The flower-stalks are slender, branched at the top, and divided\r\ninto very short pedicles, each supporting a single flower; these flowers\r\nare white, and consist of six petals, which are succeeded by a shining\r\npurple berry, of the size of a pea. This is composed of a soft, pulpy\r\nsubstance, of a purple color, having the taste of cloves and camphor,\r\nand of a kernel of the size of a pepper, which is covered with a black,\r\nshining skin, of an insipid taste.\r\n\r\nThe _camphor_ is a solid concrete juice, extracted from the wood of the\r\ncamphor-tree. Pure camphor is very white, clear, and unctuous to the\r\ntouch: the taste is bitterish-aromatic, and accompanied with a sense of\r\ncoolness: the smell is particularly fragrant, something like that of\r\nrosemary, but much stronger. It has been long esteemed for its medicinal\r\nqualities, and has been justly celebrated in fevers, malignant and\r\nepidemic distempers. In delirium, where opiates failed in procuring\r\nsleep, but rather increased and aggravated the symptoms, this medicine\r\nhas been often found to procure it. Physicians attribute these effects\r\nto its sedative qualities. It is a powerful medicine, capable of doing\r\ngreat good or harm. It is said to be poisonous to animals, often putting\r\nthem into a sleep from which they never waken.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          THE CINNAMON-PLANT.\r\n\r\nThis plant grows most abundantly in Ceylon, and is thus described by\r\nBishop Heber. After speaking of the visits of a forenoon, he adds: “In\r\nthe afternoon we drove through the far-famed cinnamon-gardens, which\r\ncover upward of seventeen thousand acres of land on the coast, the\r\nlargest of which are near Colombo. The plant thrives best in a poor,\r\nsandy soil, in a damp atmosphere. It grows wild in the woods to the size\r\nof an apple-tree, but when cultivated is never allowed to grow more than\r\nten or twelve feet in hight, each plant standing separate. The leaf is\r\nsomething like the laurel in shape, but of a lighter color. When it\r\nfirst shoots out it is red, and changes gradually to green. It is now\r\nout of blossom, but I am told the blossom is white, and spreads, when in\r\nfull blossom, to cover the garden. After hearing so much of the spicy\r\ngales from this island, I was much disappointed at not being able to\r\ndiscover any scent, at least from the plants. In passing through the\r\ngardens, there is a very fragrant-smelling flower growing under them,\r\nwhich at first led us into the belief that we smelt the cinnamons, but\r\nwe were soon undeceived. On pulling off a leaf or twig, you perceived\r\nthe spicy odor very strongly, but I was surprised to hear that the\r\nflower had little or none. As the cinnamon forms the only considerable\r\nexport of Ceylon, it is of course preserved with care. By the old Dutch\r\nlaw the penalty for cutting a branch was no less than the loss of a\r\nhand; at present a fine expiates the offense. The neighborhood of\r\nColombo is particularly favorable to its growth, being well sheltered,\r\nwith a high, equable temperature, and as showers fall frequently, the\r\nground is never parched.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TREE TEMPLE AT MATIBO IN PIEDMONT.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                            THE TREE TEMPLE.\r\n\r\nAmong the miscellaneous wonders, or at least curiosities, that the\r\ntraveler may behold as he passes through Italy, may be mentioned the\r\n_tree temple_, a view of which is given in the engraving below. This\r\nsingular tree is one of the curious ornaments of a beautiful estate,\r\ncalled Matibo, in the neighborhood of Savigliano, in Piedmont, in\r\nnorthern Italy. It was planted some seventy years ago; but it was only\r\nwithin some thirty years that the idea was started of making it grow in\r\nthe form of a temple, which, after much time, perseverance and labor,\r\nwas finally realized. It consists, as may be seen in the engraving, of\r\ntwo stories, each of which has eight windows, and is capable of\r\ncontaining twenty persons. The floors are formed of branches twined\r\ntogether with great skill, and covered by nature with leafy carpets; and\r\nall around, the natural growth and verdure of the tree have formed thick\r\nwalls, where flocks of birds have taken up their abodes and built their\r\nnests. The proprietor of the island Matibo has never disturbed these\r\njoyous little tenants of his property, but rather encouraged their\r\npresence; so that at all hours of the day, they may be heard fearlessly\r\nsporting and warbling, to the delight of the numerous visitors, who here\r\nenjoy alike the cool breezes and the beautiful prospect.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      THE TERMITES, OR WHITE ANTS.\r\n\r\nThese curious and wonderful insects are found both in India and Africa.\r\nThey are of several species, one or two of which construct works\r\nsurpassing in skill those even of the bee and beaver, and comparatively\r\nof far greater size for them, than the boasted pyramids of the ancients\r\nare for man. The laborers employed among them in these works, are not a\r\nquarter of an inch in length; and yet the structures they rear rise to\r\nthe hight of ten or even twelve feet above the surface of the earth, and\r\nin their interior construction and various arrangements, exceed even the\r\nworks of man himself. The most striking parts of these structures are\r\nthe royal apartments, the nurseries, magazines of provisions, the arched\r\nchambers and galleries, with their various communications; the ranges of\r\nthe Gothic-shaped arches, projected, and not formed by mere excavation,\r\nsome of which are two or three feet high, but which diminish rapidly,\r\nlike the arches of aisles in perspective; the various roads, sloping\r\nstaircases, and bridges consisting of one vast arch, constructed to\r\nshorten the distance between the several parts of the building, which\r\nwould otherwise be connected only by winding passages. In the following\r\nengraving may be seen, on the right, one of the ant-hills as it appears\r\n_externally_; and on the left, a _section_ of one of them, surmounted by\r\nits conical roof. In some parts of Senegal, the number, magnitude and\r\ncloseness of these structures make them appear like the villages of the\r\nnatives; and their strength is such, that when they have been raised to\r\nabout half their hight, the wild bulls of the country stand on them, as\r\nsentinels, while the rest of the herd are feeding below. When at their\r\nfull hight of ten or twelve feet, they are used by Europeans as look-out\r\nstations, whence they can see over the grass, which in Africa is, on an\r\naverage, of the hight of thirteen feet. Four or five persons may stand\r\non the top of one of these buildings, to look out for a vessel the\r\napproach of which may be expected.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ANT-HILLS OF THE WHITE ANT.]\r\n\r\nThe termites themselves are divided into three distinct ranks, or\r\norders, viz., the laborers, or working insects; the soldiers, or the\r\nfighting order, who avoid all labor, and are about twice as long as the\r\nlaborers, and nearly fifteen times their bulk; and lastly, the winged or\r\nperfect insects, which may be styled the nobility or gentry, who neither\r\nfight nor work, and from whom come the kings and queens of the\r\nestablishment.\r\n\r\nThese insects are extremely destructive; and it is said that a deserted\r\ntown has been known to be utterly destroyed by them in two or three\r\nyears, so that not a vestige of it remained. At Bombay, in a few hours,\r\nthey will demolish a large chest of books, papers, silks, or clothes,\r\nperforating them with a thousand holes; and they sometimes penetrate and\r\neat up the timbers and boards of houses, and in the same manner destroy\r\nthe timbers of a ship. The only way to preserve anything from their\r\ndepredations, when they are in a neighborhood, is to put it on a\r\nplatform resting on glass bottles, which, if kept free from dust, they\r\ncan not ascend.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HUTS IN KAMTSCHATKA.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                          HUTS IN KAMTSCHATKA.\r\n\r\nSide by side with the finished structures of animal instinct exhibited\r\nin the engraving of the ant hills above, we next give a picture of the\r\nrude huts of the uncivilized inhabitants of Kamtschatka, in their cold\r\nnorthern home, at the north-eastern extremity of Asia, which is one of\r\nthe coldest spots on the face of the earth. It is impossible, in so\r\nsevere a climate, to raise wheat, corn, or the common productions of\r\nwarmer regions. The people, however, have a compensation for the\r\nscantiness of vegetable productions in the profusion of animal life\r\nwhich seems to fill alike the earth, the air and the water. The coasts\r\nswarm with seals and other marine animals; the rocks are covered with\r\nshell-fish; the bays abound in herrings, and the rivers with salmon and\r\nother most valuable fish. Flocks of grouse, wild geese and ducks, often\r\ndarken the air. The country abounds in bears, which are fat, and greatly\r\nesteemed by the inhabitants as food. From all these sources, the people\r\nare supplied with the greatest abundance; and, as a consequence, they\r\nhave sunk into a lazy and almost stupid sensuality. They are a short and\r\ncopper-colored race, somewhat like the Esquimaux. Like them, they have\r\ndogs, which they use in sledges, as seen in the engraving. Their winter\r\nhouses are half sunk in the earth, while those for summer are elevated\r\non poles above it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TAKING A WHALE.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                               THE WHALE.\r\n\r\nThis vast monster of the deep is one of the wonders of the world, or at\r\nleast of its mighty oceans. It is found chiefly in the more northern\r\nseas, where its food, consisting of small molluscous and crustaceous\r\nanimals, but chiefly of the _clio borealis_, is found. Whales are often\r\nfound from fifty to sixty, and some of them from ninety to one hundred\r\nfeet in length, and from thirty to forty feet, and even more, in\r\ncircumference. The true whale is remarkable for the immense size of its\r\nhead, which constitutes a full third of the entire length of the animal.\r\nThe eyes are very small, and placed just above the angles of the mouth.\r\nThe external opening of the ears is scarcely perceptible. The pectoral\r\nfins are of moderate size, and located about two feet behind the angles\r\nof the mouth. The tail, or, more properly, the tail fin, consists of two\r\nparts, or lobes, of immense strength, measuring, in a full-grown whale,\r\nsome twenty feet across, from tip to tip. It is wielded by muscles of\r\nenormous power, and thus becomes a weapon of offense and defense for the\r\nwhale, as well as its chief means of locomotion. A single blow of the\r\ntail is sufficient to cut the stoutest whaleboat in two, and to send its\r\nfragments whirling through the air. The engraving gives a view of a\r\nright whale about to be harpooned; while in the distance is another,\r\nlashed to the ship for “cutting in,” and still another, which the\r\nsailors, having killed, are towing in toward it. The whale fishery was\r\ncarried on by the Biscayans as early as the twelfth century; afterward\r\nit was taken up by the Dutch and the English, and it now engages nearly\r\na tenth of the tunnage of the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        LANDING OF THE PILGRIMS.\r\n\r\nOne of the most wonderful events in the history of the world, was the\r\nvoluntary exile of the forefathers of New England from their native\r\ncountry, and their landing (December twenty-first, 1620) at\r\nPlymouth—here, in the new world, to organize a community where they\r\nmight enjoy personal freedom, and liberty of conscience, and to worship\r\nGod as seemed right to themselves. The engraving on the following page\r\ngives a view of them as they landed, in a howling wilderness, inhabited\r\nonly by savages and wild beasts, in the depth of winter, with no place\r\nof abode, or even shelter, and no trust but in their own resources and\r\nthe kind providence of God which had thus far watched over and protected\r\nthem. The history of their trials, their preservation, their growth and\r\nprosperity as a people, and of the wonderful country that has sprung up,\r\nand is still growing, with a giant growth, in the broad land which they\r\nfound a wilderness, is one that fills us with wonder as we ponder it,\r\nand that should fill us with deep thankfulness to the great source of\r\nall mercies, both to them and ourselves.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LANDING OF THE PILGRIMS.]\r\n\r\nThe place where the pilgrims landed is well known as the celebrated\r\n\r\n\r\n                             PLYMOUTH ROCK.\r\n\r\nThis is, in part, still in the same place where it stood when our\r\nforefathers first stepped upon it at their landing, and is pointed out\r\nto the visitor as “Plymouth rock,” or the “Pilgrim rock,” or the “Rock\r\nof the Pilgrims.” It is a hard kind of syenitic granite, of a dark gray\r\ncolor. The mica, which in part composes it, is in very small quantity,\r\nand in fine black particles. The rock is now in two pieces, each of\r\nwhich is about four feet through. One of these pieces, about six feet\r\nand a half in diameter, as already said, is still at the water’s edge,\r\nin its original position. The other part, represented in the engraving\r\non the next page, has been removed from its natural location, and\r\ninclosed in an iron railing in front of “Pilgrim hall,” which was\r\nerected as a monumental edifice on land that once belonged to Governor\r\nCarver. Here it is visited by thousands, who, from year to year, go, as\r\nto a shrine of the most sacred associations, to the spot which is\r\nconsecrated by the sufferings, the courage, and the piety of the\r\nfounders of our nation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLYMOUTH ROCK.]\r\n\r\nWe might fill pages with the narratives of their exposures, hardships\r\nand dangers; but they are more or less familiar to all. The history of\r\ntheir perils from the Indians, the native lords of the forest, is of\r\nitself full of excitement and thrilling interest. The latter, fearful\r\nlest the superior knowledge and rising power of the white men should in\r\nthe end be the ruin of their own supremacy, were stirred up to endeavor\r\nto exterminate them; and though some powerful chiefs and tribes were\r\nsteadfastly friendly, others were as steadfastly their foes. For years\r\nafter the firm establishment of the colonies, the early settlers were\r\ncompelled to go to church, on the Sabbath, armed, as represented in the\r\nengraving on the next page, that they might be ready, if need be, to\r\ndefend themselves in case of an attack by the Indians. During the days\r\nof the Indian warfare such scenes were not uncommon, and more than once\r\na congregation has been roused by such an attack, and gone forth to meet\r\nand disperse the foe, and then, setting their sentinels to watch,\r\nreturned to the house of God, to thank him for their deliverance, and\r\ncontinue the worship of his holy day. Thanks to their labors, and toils,\r\nand self-denials, and heroic enterprise, to the principles that guided\r\nthem and the institutions they established, and to the divine blessing\r\nattending all, we are not exposed to such perils; but may safely enjoy\r\nthe privileges they have handed down to us, with none to molest us or\r\nmake us afraid.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EARLY SETTLERS OF NEW ENGLAND GOING TO CHURCH.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                            A WONDER OF ART.\r\n\r\nThere is now (1855) on exhibition in Paris, one of the most remarkable\r\npieces of masterwork which the union of art and science has ever\r\nproduced. It consists of a picture, of about three feet square. This\r\npicture is made up of colors admirable for their beauty and boldness,\r\nbut there is no _subject_. The most experienced eye can detect nothing\r\nbut disjointed and half-formed approximations toward a coherent design.\r\nThe most able artist sees there only the finest colors, but no one can\r\ntell what they are intended to represent. In the middle of the picture,\r\nwhich is horizontally placed, is a mirror formed by a copper cylinder\r\ncovered by a perfectly polished coating of silver. This mirror is\r\nusually veiled. So far there is little remarkable, and the greatest\r\namateurs in painting would hardly consent to spend five francs on such\r\nan apparently profitless study. But it is impossible not to feel a glow\r\nof admiration, when, on uncovering the mirror, there is represented upon\r\nit in the brightest reflected rays, the whole scene of the Crucifixion.\r\nThe partial coloring then takes a character of incontestable\r\nsuperiority, and presents to the astonished spectators a picture\r\ncomposed of six most perfect figures, depicted with a degree of boldness\r\nsuch as the master painters alone knew how to impart to the subject\r\nwhich it was their glory to represent.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           THE WHALE-KILLER.\r\n\r\nThis fish is one of the wonders of the mighty deep, well known to those\r\nengaged in whaling, and in the Pacific cruisers. It is thus described by\r\none who has often witnessed its attacks on the whale.\r\n\r\n“The _killer_ is the wolf of the ocean, and hunts in packs, and their\r\ntall dorsal fin can be constantly seen above the water. This fish has\r\nalways as a companion, but swimming deeper, the _sword-fish_, and now\r\nand then can be seen the _shark_. On sighting their prey, which the\r\nkiller sees at a great distance, the pack gives chase. The unconscious\r\nwhale is slowly moving near the surface, and occasionally spouting, as\r\nit were in sport, jets of water above him. But he now suddenly sees the\r\nsea-wolf near him. Instinct at once teaches him that on the surface he\r\ncan not be safe, and, taking in a long breath, he flukes; that is,\r\ndives. But there has been another enemy watching him from the depths\r\nbelow—the sword-fish, which now darts at him with the velocity of\r\nlightning, and perforates the whale beneath, with his long and\r\nspear-like nose. This sends him at once to the surface; here he again\r\nmeets with his enemies, the killers; but as yet they are afraid to\r\napproach him. The whale now begins to see the extent of his danger, and\r\nfor a time merely lashes the water with his ponderous fluke. He soon\r\ntires of this, and remains for a short time at rest; the pack now\r\napproach him, and he seeks safety in flight. But what can he do? The\r\npoor whale has a hump on his back, and steers unsteadily, while the\r\nkiller’s tail and stiff fin steady him on his course. Nearer and nearer\r\napproach the pack to their victim; again he takes a long breath and\r\ndives. The sword-fish has steadily kept him in view; he, too, has a tall\r\nfin and long slender propelling tail; and while it is an effort to the\r\nwhale to increase his speed, it is but play to the sword-fish, which\r\nagain darts and perforates his prey, and sends the wounded whale again\r\nto the surface.\r\n\r\n“The race again commences, but this time with diminished speed, the\r\nkillers having separated to watch the rise of the whale, who, finding\r\nhis enemies in every direction, courses in a circle, and again makes a\r\nthird, and sometimes a fourth attempt to escape by diving, but is always\r\nmet by the terrible spike of the sword-fish. He at last, weak, exhausted\r\nand dispirited, returns to the surface, where he again attempts escape\r\nby flight. Streams of blood mark his course; his enemies still follow\r\nsteadily after him, until he stops and begins to lash and make the ocean\r\nfoam around him; but now large streams of his life-blood are pouring\r\nout, and he is only increasing his weakness by the exertion, and merely\r\nlashing amidst his own gore. Tired, exhausted and faint, he rolls over.\r\nThe deep red streaks of blood flowing from large orifices in his white\r\nbelly can now be distinctly seen. The hungry pack now close, and one\r\nmore bold than the rest seizes him near the throat and tears away the\r\nwhite skin and fat; he opens his mouth and bellows with pain. This is\r\ngenerally the signal for a combined attack. His tongue is seized and\r\ntorn out; so are his eyes. The sword-fish now rises to the surface, and\r\nhis tall spar-like protuberance is seen projecting over the body of the\r\nwhale; the sharks also close in and feed on the fat rejected by the\r\nkillers. In this state the whale makes a few dying struggles. The feast\r\nnow commences and continues until the fat and sufficient flesh are\r\nstripped off to cause the carcass to become too heavy to float on the\r\nsurface, and it sinks. The shark is left to enjoy his few streaks of\r\nfat, while the killer pack, accompanied by their companion, the\r\nsword-fish, rove again the broad ocean to seek another leviathan of the\r\ngreat deep.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                          A PILE OF SERPENTS.\r\n\r\nBaron Humboldt says: “In the savannas of Izacubo, Guiana, I saw the most\r\nwonderful and terrible spectacle that can be seen; and although it be\r\nnot uncommon to the natives, no traveler has ever mentioned it. We were\r\nten men on horseback, two of whom took the lead, in order to sound the\r\npassages, while I preferred to skirt the great forests. One of the\r\nblacks who formed the vanguard returned at full gallop, and called to\r\nme, ‘Here, sir, come and see the serpents in a pile.’ He pointed to\r\nsomething elevated in the middle of the savanna or swamp, which appeared\r\nlike a bundle of arms. One of my company said, ‘This is certainly one of\r\nthe assemblages of serpents which heap themselves on each other after a\r\nviolent tempest. I have heard of these, but never saw any; let us\r\nproceed cautiously, and not too near them.’ When we were within twenty\r\npaces of it, the terror of our horses prevented our approaching nearer,\r\nto which none of us were inclined. On a sudden, the pyramid mass became\r\nagitated; a horrid hissing issued from it, thousands of serpents rolled\r\nspirally on each other, and shot forth out of the circle their hideous\r\nheads, presenting their envenomed darts and fiery eyes to us. I own I\r\nwas the first to draw back, but when I saw this formidable phalanx\r\nremain at its post, and appear to be more disposed to defend itself than\r\nto attack us, I rode round, in order to view its order of battle, which\r\nfaced the enemy on every side. I then thought what could be the design\r\nof this numerous assemblage; and I concluded that this species of\r\nserpent dreaded some colossean enemy, which might be the great serpent\r\nor cayman, and they reunite themselves after seeing the enemy, so as to\r\nresist this enemy in a mass.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                            AMERICAN RUINS.\r\n\r\nThe recent discoveries in what is called the “Great Basin,” a tract of\r\ntable-land lying between the Rocky and the Pacific chain of mountains,\r\nare exciting much interest, and awakening inquiry and speculation again\r\nas to the origin of the people who evidently, in a former period,\r\ninhabited these now desolate regions. Captain Walker, the mountaineer,\r\npassed through the center of this basin in 1850, and made some\r\ninteresting revelations of what he saw. These statements have been\r\ncalled in question, on account of their supposed improbability; but a\r\nlater trip of Lieutenant Beale gives a degree of confirmation to the\r\nfacts, which will make the credibility of the statements more readily\r\nadmitted. The whole country, from the Colorado to the Rio Grande,\r\nbetween the Gila and San Juan, is full of ruined habitations and cities,\r\nmost of which are on this table-land. Captain Walker states that, in\r\ntraversing this desert, he had frequently met with crumbling masses of\r\nmasonry and numberless specimens of antique pottery.\r\n\r\nIn his last trip across, he saw the ruins of a city more than a mile in\r\nextent, the streets of which ran at right angles. The houses had all\r\nbeen built of stone, but all had been reduced to ruin by the action of\r\nsome great heat, which had evidently passed over the whole country. In\r\nthe center of the city rose abruptly a rock twenty or thirty feet high,\r\nupon the top of which stood a portion of the walls of what had once been\r\nan immense building. The outline of the building was still distinct,\r\nalthough only the northern angle, with walls fifteen or eighteen feet\r\nlong, and ten feet high, was standing. These walls were constructed of\r\nstone, well quarried and well built. Lieutenant Beale, on his first trip\r\nacross the continent, discovered in the midst of the wilderness of Gila,\r\nwhat appeared to be a strong fort, the walls of great thickness, built\r\nof stone. He traversed it, and found it contained forty-two rooms. A\r\ncorrespondent of the Placerville Herald gives an account more wonderful\r\nstill, of a stone bridge, which had also been discovered, the\r\nfoundations of which were of stone, and nearly six hundred feet from one\r\nof the outer abutments to the other, while between the two are no less\r\nthan seven distinct piers. This bridge has the appearance of a river\r\nonce flowing between its piers, though now there is not the slightest\r\nappearance of such a river in that vicinity.\r\n\r\nNext we have an account of a strange race of people, neither whites nor\r\nIndians, called Moquis, lighter in color than the Indians of California.\r\nThe women are tolerably fair, not being so much exposed to the sun.\r\nAmong them Captain Walker saw three perfectly white, with white hair and\r\nlight eyes. They raise all kinds of grain, melons and vegetables. They\r\nhave also a number of orchards, filled with many kinds of fruit-trees.\r\nThe peaches they raise are particularly fine. They have large flocks of\r\nsheep and goats, but very few beasts of burden or cattle. They are a\r\nharmless, inoffensive race; kind and hospitable to strangers, and make\r\nvery little resistance when attacked. The warlike Navajos, who dwell in\r\nthe mountains to the north-east of them, are in the habit of sweeping\r\ndown upon them every two or three years, and driving off their stock. At\r\nsuch times, they gather up all that is movable from their farms, and fly\r\nfor refuge to their mountain stronghold. Here their enemies dare not\r\nfollow them. When a stranger approaches, they appear on the top of the\r\nrocks and houses, watching his movements. One of their villages, at\r\nwhich Captain Walker stayed for several days, is over six hundred yards\r\nlong. The houses are mostly built of stone and mortar; some of adobe.\r\nThey are very snug and comfortable, and many of them are two and even\r\nthree stories high. The inhabitants are considerably advanced in some of\r\nthe arts, and manufacture excellent woolen clothing, blankets, leather,\r\nbasket-work and pottery. Unlike most of the Indian tribes in this\r\ncountry, the women work within doors, the men performing all the farm\r\nand out-door labor. These people, according to the accounts, have never\r\nhad any intercourse with the white race.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            INSECT SLAVERY.\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable fact connected with the history of ants, is the\r\npropensity possessed by certain species to kidnap the workers of other\r\nspecies, and compel them to labor for the benefit of the community, thus\r\nusing them completely as slaves; and, as far as we yet know, the\r\nkidnappers are red or pale-colored ants, and the slaves, like the\r\nill-treated natives of Africa, are of a jet black. The time for\r\ncapturing slaves extends over a period of about ten weeks, and never\r\ncommences until the male and female are about emerging from the pupa\r\nstate; and thus the ruthless marauders never interfere with the\r\ncontinuation of the species. When the red ants are about to sally forth\r\non a marauding expedition, they send scouts to ascertain the exact\r\nposition in which a colony of negroes may be found. These scouts having\r\ndiscovered the objects of their search, return to the nest and report\r\ntheir success. Shortly afterward, the army of red ants marches forth,\r\nheaded by a vanguard, which is perpetually changing; the individuals\r\nwhich constitute it, when they advance a little before, are sent to the\r\nrear, and their places occupied by others. The vanguard consists of\r\neight or ten ants only. When they have arrived near the negro colony,\r\nthey disperse, wandering through the herbage and hunting about, as if\r\naware of the propinquity of the object of their search, yet ignorant of\r\nits exact position. At last they discover the settlements, and the\r\nforemost of the invaders, rushing impetuously to the attack, are met,\r\ngrappled with, and frequently killed by the negroes on guard. The alarm\r\nis quickly communicated to the interior of the nest; the negroes sally\r\nforth by thousands, and the red ants rushing to the rescue, a desperate\r\nconflict ensues, which, however, always terminates in the defeat of the\r\nnegroes, who retire to the innermost recesses of their habitation. Now\r\nfollows the scene of pillage. The red ants, with their powerful\r\nmandibles, tear open the sides of the ant-hills, and rush into the heart\r\nof the citadel. In a few minutes each invader emerges, carrying in its\r\nmouth the pupa of a worker negro, which it has obtained in spite of the\r\nvigilance and valor of its natural guardians. The red ants return in\r\nperfect order to their nests, bearing with them their living burdens. On\r\nreaching the nest the pupa appears to be treated precisely as their own;\r\nand the workers, when they emerge, perform the various duties of the\r\ncommunity with the greatest energy and apparent good-will. They repair\r\nthe nest, excavate passages, collect food, feed the larvæ, take the pupa\r\ninto the sunshine, and perform every office which the welfare of the\r\ncolony seems to require. They conduct themselves entirely as if\r\nfulfilling their original destination.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n                           Transcriber’s Note\r\n\r\nAt 94.32, there is a paragraph preceding some verse which ends abruptly,\r\nwithout punctuation. It seems that the intent was to continue the\r\nthought with the first lines of the poem.\r\n\r\nAt 530.18, a closing quote mark occurs where there is no opening quote.\r\nThe previous paragraph closes an extended quotation, which is not\r\nre-opened. It is difficult to say whether the ‘voice’ has shifted. In\r\nany case, the closing quote in question has been removed.\r\n\r\nThe word ‘bass-relief’ appears thirty-two times, while the more familiar\r\n‘bas-relief’ appears only twice. Both versions have been retained.\r\n\r\nOther errors deemed most likely to be the printer’s have been corrected,\r\nand are noted here. The references are to the page and line in the\r\noriginal.\r\n\r\n  9.18     an object must be seen[,]                      Removed.\r\n  18.1     “THE CASTA[G]NO DE CENTO CAVILLI,”             Inserted.\r\n  26.17    rate of eight[y]-six feet an hour              Added.\r\n  28.2     wholly disap[p]eared                           Inserted.\r\n  36.1     mottled with black and[ and] white spots       Redundant.\r\n  82.17    Mauna Loa and Mauna [R/K]ea                    Replaced.\r\n  87.33    In many [y/p]arts of the precipice             Replace.\r\n  126.23   by any sounding line[,/.]                      Replaced.\r\n  198.12   carried on in Colebrook[ ]dale                 Removed.\r\n  230.17   Earth’s universal family.[”]                   Added.\r\n  275.23   [‘/“]the waterfall mountain,”                  Replaced.\r\n  289.1    some of the savan[t]s                          Inserted.\r\n  317.17   or St. Helmo’s fires                           _sic_:\r\n                                                          Elmo’s.\r\n  324.28   I had thought a mere fable.[’/”]               Replaced.\r\n  348.36   from such a[ ]surface                          Inserted.\r\n  421.6    four hund[d]red feet                           Removed.\r\n  427.27   it[s] extreme length                           Added.\r\n  446.21   fresh-water mus[cle/sel]s                      Replaced.\r\n  470.23   the name of E[d/l] Hedjeaz                     Probable.\r\n  470.24   the cities of Medi[an/na] and Taif             Transposed.\r\n  511.15   PYRAMIDS OF MERO[E/Ë]                          Replaced.\r\n  516.3    so has it been forever!’[”]                    Added.\r\n  525.37   and quitted them forever.[”]                   Added.\r\n  610.15   in Agræ[./,]                                   Replaced.\r\n  634.22   these ancient piles.[”]                        Added.\r\n  649.35   the f[ri/ir]th of Forth                        Transposed.\r\n  655.24   On the top is a bas[o/i]n                      Replaced.\r\n  710.37   [“]France, Belgium, Holland,                   Added.\r\n  798.27   closed by the operator at will[.]              Restored.",
