Our\r\ninvestigation is not very closely or directly concerned with scholastic\r\ntheology, which I hope to show did not so exclusively absorb the\r\nintellectual energy of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries as has\r\nsometimes been asserted. Our attention will be mainly devoted as\r\nheretofore to the pursuit of natural science during that period and the\r\nprominence both of experimental method and of magic in the same. But\r\nour investigation deals not only with magic and experimental science,\r\nbut with their relation to Christian thought. It is therefore with\r\ninterest that we turn to the works of these two early representatives\r\nof scholastic theology, and inquire what cognizance, if any, they take\r\nof the subjects in which we are especially interested. As we proceed\r\ninto the later twelfth and thirteenth centuries in subsequent chapters,\r\nwe shall also take occasion to note the utterances of other leading men\r\nof learning who speak largely from the theological standpoint, like\r\nJohn of Salisbury and Thomas Aquinas. Let us hasten to admit also\r\nthat the scholastic method of instruction and writing made itself felt\r\nin natural science and medicine as well as in theology, as a number\r\nof our subsequent chapters will illustrate. In the present chapter we\r\nshall furthermore be brought again into contact with the topic of the\r\n_Physiologus_ and Latin Bestiaries, owing to the fact that a treatise\r\nof this sort has been ascribed, although probably incorrectly, to Hugh\r\nof St. Victor.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Character of Abelard’s learning.]\r\n\r\nThere is no more familiar, and possibly no more important, figure in\r\nthe history of Latin learning during the twelfth century than Peter\r\nAbelard who flourished at its beginning. His career, as set forth in\r\nhis own words, illustrates educational conditions in Gaul at that time.\r\nHis brilliant success as a lecturer on logic and theology at Paris\r\nreveals the great medieval university of that city in embryo. His\r\npioneer work, _Sic et Non_, set the fashion for the standard method\r\nof presentation employed in scholasticism. He was not, however, the\r\nonly daring and original spirit of his time; his learned writings were\r\nalmost entirely in those fields known as patristic and scholastic; and,\r\nas in the case of _Sic et Non_, consist chiefly in a repetition of the\r\nutterances of the fathers. This is especially true of his statements\r\nconcerning astrology, the _magi_, and demons. To natural science he\r\ngave little or no attention. Nevertheless his intellectual prominence\r\nand future influence make it advisable to note what position he took\r\nupon these points.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Incorrect statements of his views.]\r\n\r\nAlthough not original, his views concerning the stars and their\r\ninfluences are the more essential to expose, because writers upon\r\nAbelard have misunderstood and consequently misinterpreted them.\r\nJoseph McCabe in his Life of Abelard,[1] for instance, asserts that\r\nAbelard calls mathematics diabolical in one of his works. And Charles\r\nJourdain in his in some ways excellent[2] _Dissertation sur l’état\r\nde la philosophie naturelle en occident et principalement en France\r\npendant la première moitié du XIIe siècle_, praises Abelard for what\r\nhe regards as an admirable attack upon and criticism of astrology in\r\nhis _Expositio in Hexameron_, saying, “It will be hard to find in the\r\nwriters of a later age anything more discriminating on the errors of\r\nastrology.”[3] Jourdain apparently did not realize the extent to which\r\nAbelard was simply repeating the writers of an earlier age. However,\r\nAbelard’s presentation possesses a certain freshness and perhaps\r\ncontains some original observations.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The nature of the stars.]\r\n\r\nIn the passage in question[4] Abelard first discusses the nature of\r\nthe stars. He says that it is no small question whether the planets\r\nare animated, as the philosophers think, and have spirits who control\r\ntheir motion, or whether they hold their unvarying course merely by\r\nthe will and order of God. Philosophers do not hesitate to declare\r\nthem rational, immortal, and impassive animals, and the Platonists\r\ncall them not only gods but gods of gods, as being more excellent and\r\nhaving greater efficacy than the other stars. Moreover, Augustine says\r\nin his _Handbook_ that he is uncertain whether to class the sun, moon,\r\nand stars with the angels. In his _Retractions_ Augustine withdrew\r\nhis earlier statement that this world is an animal, as Plato and\r\nother philosophers believe, not because he was sure it was false, but\r\nbecause he could not certainly prove it true either by reason or by\r\nthe authority of divine scripture. Abelard does not venture to state\r\nan opinion of his own, but he at least has done little to refute a\r\nview of the nature of the heavenly bodies which is quite favorable to,\r\nand usually was accompanied by, astrology. Also he displays the wonted\r\nmedieval respect for the opinions of the philosophers in general and\r\nthe leaning of the twelfth century toward Plato in particular.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Prediction of natural and contingent events.]\r\n\r\nAbelard next comes to the problem of the influence of the stars upon\r\nthis earth and man. He grants that the stars control heat and cold,\r\ndrought and moisture; he accepts the astrological division of the\r\nheavens into houses, in certain ones of which each planet exerts its\r\nmaximum of force; and he believes that men skilled in knowledge of the\r\nstars can by astronomy predict much concerning the future of things\r\nhaving natural causes. Astronomical observations to his mind are very\r\nvaluable not only in agriculture but in medicine, and he mentions that\r\nMoses himself is believed to have been very skilful in this science of\r\nthe Egyptians. It is only to the attempt to predict _contingentia_ as\r\ndistinguished from _naturalia_ that he objects. By _contingentia_ he\r\nseems to mean events in which chance and divine providence or human\r\nchoice and free will are involved. He gives as a proof that astrologers\r\ncannot predict such events the fact that, while they will foretell to\r\nyou what other persons will do, they refuse to tell you openly which\r\nof two courses you yourself will pursue for fear that you may prove\r\nthem wrong by wilfully doing the contrary to what they predict. Or, if\r\nan astrologer is able to predict such “contingent events,” it must be\r\nbecause the devil has assisted him, and hence Abelard declares that he\r\nwho promises anyone certitude concerning “contingent happenings” by\r\nmeans of “astronomy” is to be considered not so much _astronomicus_ as\r\n_diabolicus_. This is the nearest approach that I have been able to\r\nfind in Abelard’s writings to McCabe’s assertion that he once called\r\nmathematics diabolical. But possibly I have overlooked some other\r\npassage where Abelard calls _mathematica_, in the sense of divination,\r\ndiabolical.[5] In any case Abelard rejects astrology only in part and\r\naccepts it with certain qualifications. His attitude is about the\r\naverage one of his own time and of ages preceding and following.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Magi and the star.]\r\n\r\nAbelard speaks of the Magi and the star of Bethlehem in a sermon for\r\nEpiphany.[6] This familiar theme, as we have seen, had often occupied\r\nthe pens of the church fathers, so that Abelard has nothing new to\r\nsay. On the contrary, he exhausts neither the authorities nor the\r\nsubject in the passages which he selects for repetition. His first\r\npoint is that the Magi were fittingly the first of the Gentiles to\r\nbecome Christian converts because they before had been the masters\r\nof the greatest error, condemned by law with soothsayers to death,\r\nand indebted for their “nefarious and execrable doctrine” to demons.\r\nIn short, Abelard identifies them with magicians and takes that word\r\nin the worst sense. He is aware, however, that some identify them\r\nnot with sorcerers (_malefici_) but with astronomers. He repeats the\r\nlegend from the spurious homily of Chrysostom which we have already\r\nrecounted[7] of how the magi had for generations watched for the star,\r\nwarned by the writing of Seth which they possessed, and how the star\r\nfinally appeared in the form of a little child with a cross above it\r\nand spake with them. He also states that they were called _magici_ in\r\ntheir tongue because they glorified God in silence, without appearing\r\nto note that this is contrary to his previous use of _magi_ in an evil\r\nsense. Abelard believes that a new star announced the birth of Christ,\r\nthe heavenly king, although he grants that comets, which we read of as\r\nannouncing the deaths of earthly sovereigns, are not new stars. He also\r\ndiscusses without satisfactory results the question why this new star\r\nwas seen only by the Magi.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Demons and forces in nature.]\r\n\r\nIn a chapter “On the Suggestions of Demons” in his _Ethica seu Scito te\r\nipsum_,[8] Abelard attempts to a certain extent a natural explanation\r\nof the tempting of men by demons and the arousing of lust and other\r\nevil passions within us. In this he perhaps makes his closest approach\r\nto the standpoint of natural science, although he is simply repeating\r\nan idea found already in Augustine and other church fathers. In plants\r\nand seeds and trees and stones, Abelard explains, there reside many\r\nforces adapted to arouse or calm our passions. The demons, owing to\r\ntheir subtle ingenuity and their long experience with the natures\r\nof things, are acquainted with all these occult properties and make\r\nuse of them for their own evil ends. Thus they sometimes, by divine\r\npermission, send men into trances or give remedies to those making\r\nsupplications to them, “and often when such cease to feel pain, they\r\nare believed to be cured.” Abelard also mentions the marvels which the\r\ndemons worked in Egypt in opposition to Moses by means of Pharaoh’s\r\nmagicians.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Magic and natural science.]\r\n\r\nEvidently then Abelard believes both in the existence of demons and\r\nof occult virtues in nature by which marvels may be worked. Magic\r\navails itself both of demonic and natural forces. The demons are more\r\nthoroughly acquainted with the secrets of nature than are men. But\r\nthis does not prove that scientific research is necessarily diabolical\r\nor that anyone devoting himself to investigation of nature is giving\r\nhimself over to demons. The inevitable conclusion is rather that if\r\nmen will practice the same long experimentation and will exercise the\r\nsame “subtle ingenuity” as the demons have, there is nothing to prevent\r\nthem, too, from becoming at last thoroughly acquainted with the natural\r\npowers of things. Also magic, since it avails itself of natural forces,\r\nis akin to natural science, while natural science may hope some day\r\nto rival both the knowledge of the demons and the marvels of magic.\r\nAbelard does not go on to draw any of these conclusions, but other\r\nmedieval writers were to do so before very long.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Hugh of St. Victor.]\r\n\r\nUpon Hugh of St. Victor Vincent of Beauvais in the century following\r\nlooked back as “illustrious in religion and knowledge of literature”\r\nand as “second to no one of his time in skill in the seven liberal\r\narts.”[9] Hugh was Abelard’s younger contemporary, born almost twenty\r\nyears later in Saxony in 1096 but dying a year before Abelard in 1141.\r\nHis uncle, the bishop of Halberstadt, had preceded him at Paris as\r\na student under William of Champeaux. When Hugh, as an Augustinian\r\ncanon, reached the monastery of St. Victor at Paris, William had\r\nceased to teach and become a bishop. Hugh was himself chosen head\r\nof the school in 1133. He is famous as a mystic, but also composed\r\nexegetical and dogmatic works, and is noted for his classification\r\nof the sciences. Edward Myers well observes in this connection:\r\n“Historians of philosophy are now coming to see that it betrays a lack\r\nof psychological imagination to be unable to figure the subjective\r\ncoexistence of Aristotelian dialectics with mysticism of the Victorine\r\nor Bernardine type--and even their compenetration. Speculative thought\r\nwas not, and could not be, isolated from religious life lived with such\r\nintensity as it was in the middle ages, when that speculative thought\r\nwas active everywhere, in every profession, in every degree of the\r\nsocial scale.”[10] Later, in the case of St. Hildegard of Bingen, we\r\nshall meet an even more striking combination of mysticism and natural\r\nscience.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Character of the _Didascalicon_.]\r\n\r\nOf Hugh’s writings we shall be chiefly concerned with the\r\n_Didascalicon_, or _Eruditio didascalica_,[11] a brief work whose six\r\nbooks occupy some seventy columns in Migne’s _Patrologia_. It is\r\nespecially devoted, as its first chapter clearly states, to instructing\r\nthe student what to read and how to read. On the whole, especially\r\nfor its early twelfth century date, it is a clear, systematic, and\r\nsensible treatise, which shows that medieval men were wider readers\r\nthan has often been supposed and that they had some sound ideas on how\r\nto study. In order to have a basis for systematic study, Hugh describes\r\nand classifies the various arts and sciences, mechanical and liberal,\r\ntheoretical and practical. He is possibly influenced in his definitions\r\nand derivations by Isidore’s _Etymologies_, although he seldom if ever\r\nacknowledges the debt, whereas he cites Boethius a number of times,\r\nbut at least his classification and arrangement of material are quite\r\ndifferent from Isidore’s. In this description and classification,\r\nand indeed throughout the treatise, Hugh seems to display no little\r\noriginality of thought and arrangement--once he tells us of his own\r\nmethods of study[12]--although his facts and details are mostly\r\nfamiliar ones from ancient authors and although he of course embodies\r\ngenerally accepted notions such as the _trivium_ and _quadrivium_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Meaning of _physica_.]\r\n\r\nTo the four subjects of the _quadrivium_ he adds _physica_ or\r\n_physiologia_,[13] which he says “considers and investigates the causes\r\nof things in their effects and their effects in their causes.” He\r\nquotes from Vergil’s _Georgics_, (II, 479-)\r\n\r\n    “Whence earthquakes come, what force disturbs the deep,\r\n    Virtues of herbs, the minds and wraths of brutes,\r\n    All kinds of fruits, of reptiles, too, and gems.”\r\n\r\nThus _Physica_ is more inclusive than the modern science of Physics,\r\nwhile Hugh evidently does not employ it in the specific sense of the\r\nart of medicine, of which the word _physica_ was sometimes used in the\r\nmedieval period. Hugh goes on to say that _Physica_ is sometimes still\r\nmore broadly interpreted to designate natural philosophy in contrast to\r\nlogical and ethical philosophy. His quotation from the _Georgics_ also\r\ncauses one to reflect on the prominent part played in natural science\r\nfrom before Vergil to after Hugh by the semi-human characteristics\r\nascribed to animals and the occult virtues ascribed to herbs and gems.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The study of history.]\r\n\r\nHugh’s attitude to history is interesting to note in passing. In\r\nhis classification of the sciences he does not assign it a distinct\r\nplace as he does to economics and politics, but he shows his inchoate\r\nsense of the importance of the history of science and of thought by\r\nattempting a list of the founders of the various arts and sciences.[14]\r\nIn this connection he adopts the theory of the origin of the Etruscans\r\nat present in favor with scholars, that they came from Lydia. He\r\nregards the study of Biblical or sacred history as the first essential\r\nfor a theologian, who should learn history from beginning to end before\r\nhe proceeds to doctrine and allegory.[15] Four essential points to note\r\nin studying history in Hugh’s opinion are the person, the event, the\r\ntime, and the place.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The two mathematics: astrology, natural and superstitious.]\r\n\r\nIn discussing the _quadrivium_ Hugh explains the significance of the\r\nterms, _mathematica_, _astronomia_, and _astrologia_. _Mathematica_, in\r\nwhich the first letter “t” has the aspirate, denotes sound doctrine and\r\nthe science of abstract quantity, and embraces within itself the four\r\nsubjects of the _quadrivium_. In other words it denotes mathematics in\r\nour sense of the word. But _matesis_, spelled without the aspirate,\r\nsignifies that superstitious vanity which places the fate of man under\r\nthe constellations.[16] Hugh thus allows for the common use since the\r\ntime of the Roman Empire of the word _mathematicus_ for an astrologer,\r\nand the frequent use of _mathematica_ in the sense of the Greek word\r\n_mantike_ or divination. He correctly states the Greek derivation of\r\nastrology and astronomy and employs those words in just about their\r\nmodern sense. Astrology considers the stars in order to determine\r\nthe nativity, death, and certain other events. For Hugh, however, it\r\nis not wholly a superstition, but “partly natural science, partly\r\na superstition,” since he believes that the condition of the human\r\nbody as well as of other bodies depends upon the constellations, and\r\nthat sickness and health as well as storms or fair weather, fertility\r\nand sterility, can be predicted from the stars, but that it is\r\nsuperstitious to assert their control over contingent events and acts\r\nof free will,--the same distinction as that made by Abelard.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The superlunar and sublunar worlds.]\r\n\r\nIn an earlier discussion of the universe above and beneath the moon[17]\r\nHugh had further emphasized the superiority of the heavenly bodies\r\nand their power over earthly life and nature. He distinguished three\r\nkinds of beings: God the Creator (_solus naturae genitor et artifex_)\r\nwho alone is without beginning or end and truly eternal, the bodies of\r\nthe superlunar world which have a beginning but no end and are called\r\nperpetual and divine, and sublunar and terrestrial things which have\r\nboth a beginning and an end. The mathematicians call the superlunar\r\nworld nature, and the sublunar world the work of nature, because all\r\nlife and growth in it comes “through invisible channels from the\r\nsuperior bodies.” They also call the upper world time, because of\r\nthe movements of the heavenly bodies in it determining time, and the\r\nlower world temporal, because it is moved according to the superior\r\nmotions. They further call the superlunar world Elysium on account of\r\nits perpetual light and peace, while they call the other _Infernum_\r\nbecause of its confusion and constant fluctuation. Hugh adds that he\r\nhas touched upon these points in order to show man that, in so far as\r\nhe shares in this world of change, he is like it, subject to necessity,\r\nwhile in so far as he is immortal he is related to the Godhead.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Discussion of magic.]\r\n\r\nHugh’s brief, but clear and pithy, account of magic occurs in the\r\nclosing chapter of his sixth and last book,[18] and seems to be rather\r\nin the nature of an _addendum_. It is, indeed, missing from the\r\n_Didascalicon_ in some of the earliest manuscripts[19] and is found\r\nseparately in the same collection of manuscripts, so that possibly it\r\nis not by Hugh. At any rate, magic is treated by itself apart from\r\nhis previous description and classification of the arts and sciences\r\nand listing of their founders. The definition of magic makes it clear\r\nwhy it is thus segregated: “Magic is not included in philosophy, but\r\nis a distinct subject, false in its professions, mistress of all\r\niniquity and malice, deceiving concerning the truth and truly doing\r\nharm; it seduces souls from divine religion, promotes the worship of\r\ndemons, engenders corruption of morals, and impels the minds of its\r\nfollowers to every crime and abomination.” Hugh had prefaced this\r\ndefinition by much the usual meager history of the origin of magic to\r\nbe found in Isidore and other writers, but his definition proper seems\r\nrather original in its form and in a way admirable in its attitude.\r\nThe ancient classical feeling that magic was evil and the Christian\r\nprejudice against it as the work of demons still play a large part\r\nin his summary of the subject, but to these two points that magic\r\nis hostile to Christianity or irreligious, and that it is improper,\r\nimmoral, and criminal, he adds the other two points that it is not a\r\npart of philosophy--in other words, it is unscientific, and that it is\r\nmore or less untrue and unreal. Or these four points may be reduced to\r\ntwo: since law, religion, and learning unite in condemning magic, it is\r\nunsocial in every respect; and it is more or less untrue, unreal, and\r\nunscientific.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Five subdivisions of magic.]\r\n\r\nHugh’s list of various forbidden and occult arts which are\r\nsub-divisions of magic is somewhat similar to that of Isidore, but he\r\nclassifies and groups them logically under five main heads in a way\r\nwhich appears to be partly his own, and which was followed by other\r\nsubsequent writers, such as Roger Bacon. His first three main heads\r\nall deal with arts of divination. _Mantike_ divides as usual into\r\nnecromancy, geomancy, hydromancy, aerimancy, and pyromancy. Under\r\n_mathematica_ are listed _aruspicina_, or the observation of hours\r\n(_horae_) or of entrails (_hara_); augury, or observation of birds; and\r\n_horoscopia_, or the observation of nativities. The third main head,\r\n_sortilegia_, deals with divination by lots. The fourth main head,\r\n_maleficia_, with which magic has already been twice identified in the\r\nchapter, is now described by Hugh as “the performance of evil deeds\r\nby incantations to demons, or by ligatures or any other accursed kind\r\nof remedies with the co-operation and instruction of demons.”[20]\r\nFifth and last come _praestigia_, in which “by phantastic illusions\r\nconcerning the transformation of objects the human senses are deceived\r\nby demoniacal art.”[21]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _De bestiis et aliis rebus._]\r\n\r\nAmong the doubtful and spurious works ascribed to Hugh is a bestiary\r\nin four books,[22] in which various birds and beasts are described,\r\nand spiritual and moral applications are made from them. At least\r\nthis is the character of the first part of the treatise; towards the\r\nclose it becomes simply a glossary of all sorts of natural objects.\r\n_Physiologus_ is often cited for the natural properties of birds\r\nand beasts, but as we have already dealt with the problem of the\r\n_Physiologus_ in an earlier chapter, and as we shall sufficiently deal\r\nwith the properties and natures ascribed to animals in the middle ages\r\nin describing the treatment of them by various encyclopedists like\r\nThomas of Cantimpré, Bartholomew of England, and Albertus Magnus, we\r\nare at present mainly interested in some other features of the treatise\r\nbefore us. It is often illustrated with illuminations of birds and\r\nanimals in the manuscripts and was originally intended to be so, as\r\nthe prologue on the hawk and dove by its monkish author to a noble\r\nconvert, Raynerus, makes evident. “Wishing to satisfy the petitions\r\nof your desire, I decided to paint the dove whose ‘wings are covered\r\nwith silver, and her feathers with yellow gold,’ and to edify minds by\r\npainting, in order that what the simple mind can scarcely grasp by the\r\neye of the intellect, it might at least discern with the carnal eye,\r\nand vision perceive what hearing could scarcely comprehend. However,\r\nI wished not only to depict the dove graphically but to describe it\r\nin words and to explain the painting by writing, so that he whom the\r\nsimplicity of the picture did not please might at least be pleased by\r\nthe morality of Scripture.” Indeed, the work is often entitled _The\r\nGilded Dove_ in the manuscripts. The treatise is manifestly of a\r\nreligious and popular rather than scientific character. One interesting\r\npassage states that a monk should not practice medicine because “a\r\ndoctor sometimes sees things which are not decent to see,” and “touches\r\nwhat it is improper for the religious to touch.” Furthermore, a\r\nphysician “speaks of uncertain matters by means of experiments, but\r\nexperience is deceitful and so often errs. But this is not fitting for\r\na monk that he should speak aught but the truth.”[23] It is rather\r\nsurprising to find free will attributed to the wild beasts, who are\r\nsaid to wander about at their will.[24] This passage, however, is\r\nsimply copied from Isidore.[25]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] J.

Hauréau, _Les Œuvres de Hugues\r\nde Saint-Victor, Essai critique, nouvelle edition_, Paris, 1886,\r\ndemonstrated that there should be only six books of the _Didascalicon_\r\ninstead of seven as in this edition and that of 1648. This will not\r\naffect our investigation, as we shall make no use of the seventh book,\r\nbut we shall have later to discuss whether a passage on magic belongs\r\nat the close of the sixth book or not. There appears to be a somewhat\r\ngeneral impression that the edition of 1648 is the earliest edition of\r\nHugh’s works, but the British Museum has an undated incunabulum of the\r\n“Didascolon” numbered IB. 859, fol. 254.\r\n\r\nVincent of Beauvais in the thirteenth century speaks of the\r\n“Didascolon” as in five books (_Speculum doctrinale_, XVIII, 62) but\r\nis probably mistaken. The MSS seem uniformly to divide the work into a\r\nprologue and six books, as in the following at Oxford:\r\n\r\nNew College 144, 11th (_sic_) century, folio bene exaratus et servatus,\r\nfols. 105-43, “Incipit prologus in Didascalicon.”\r\n\r\nJesus College 35, 12th century, fol. 26-\r\n\r\nSt. John’s 98, 14th century, fol. 123-\r\n\r\nCorpus Christi 223, 15th century, fol. 73-\r\n\r\nI have not noted what MSS of the _Didascalicon_ there are in the\r\nBritish Museum.

A little later in the twelfth century John of Salisbury\r\n(_Polycraticus_, II, 18) makes the distinction between the two\r\n_mateses_ or mathematics lie rather in the quantity of the penultimate\r\nvowel “e”. In the thirteenth century Albertus Magnus (_Commentary\r\non Matthew_, II, 1) also distinguished between the two varieties of\r\nmathematics according to the length of the “e” in “_mathesis_”; but he\r\ndid not regard the second variety as necessarily superstitious, but\r\nas divination from the stars which might be either good or bad, like\r\nHugh’s _astrologia_.\r\n\r\nRoger Bacon mentioned both methods of distinction between the true and\r\nfalse mathematics; but statements in his different works are not in\r\nagreement as to which case it is in which the “e” is long or short. In\r\nthe _Opus Maius_ (Bridges, I, 239 and note) and _Opus Tertium_ (caps. 9\r\nand 65) he states that the vowel is short in the true mathematics and\r\nlong in the superstitious variety; but in other writings he took the\r\nopposite view and declared that “all the Latins” were wrong in thinking\r\notherwise (see Bridges, I, 239 note; Steele (1920) viii).\r\n\r\nIn a twelfth century MS at Munich (CLM 19488, pp. 17-23) a treatise or\r\nperhaps an excerpt from some longer work, entitled _De differentiis\r\nvocabulorum_, opens with the words, “Scire facit mathesis et divinare\r\nmathesis.” Roger Bacon says (Steele, 1920, p. 3), “Set glomerelli\r\nnescientes Grecum ... ex magna sua ignorancia vulgaverunt hos versus\r\nfalsos:\r\n\r\nScire facit matesis, set divinare mathesis; Philosophi matesim, magici\r\ndixere mathesim.”\r\n\r\n\r\n[17] _Didascalicon_, I, 7.\r\n\r\n[18] _Didasc._ VI, 15 (Migne PL 176, 810-12).\r\n\r\n[19] BN nouv. acq. 1429, 12th century, fols. iv-23, and CLM 2572,\r\nwritten between 1182 and 1199; both end with the thirteenth chapter of\r\nBook VI, or at col. 809 in Migne. St. John’s 98, 14th century, fol.\r\n145v, also ends at this point. Jesus College 35, 12th century, is\r\nmutilated at the close.\r\n\r\nOther early MSS, however, include the passage on magic in the\r\n_Didascalicon_, and end the sixth book with the closing words of the\r\naccount of magic, “Hydromancy first came from the Persians”: see\r\nVitry-le-François 19, 12th century, fols. 1-46; Mazarine 717, 13th\r\ncentury, #9, closing at fol. 97v.\r\n\r\nThe passage on magic is also cited as Hugh’s by Robert Kilwardby,\r\narchbishop of Canterbury 1272-1279, in his work on the division of the\r\nsciences, cap. 67: MSS are Balliol 3; Merton 261.\r\n\r\nIn Cortona 35, 15th century, fol. 203, the _Didascalicon_ in six books\r\nis first followed by a brief passage, _Divisio philosophie\r\ncontinentium_, which is perhaps simply the fourteenth chapter\r\nof the sixth book as printed in Migne, and then at fol. 224 by the\r\npassage concerning magic and its subdivisions.\r\n\r\nThe account of magic also occurs in MSS which do not contain the\r\n_Didascalicon_, for instance, Vatic. Palat. Lat. 841, 13th century,\r\nfol. 139r, “Magice artis quinque sunt species....”\r\n\r\n[20] “Malefici sunt qui per incantationes daemonicas sive ligaturas vel\r\nalia quaecunque exsecrabilia remediorum genera cooperatione daemonum\r\natque instructu nefanda perficiunt.”\r\n\r\n[21] “Praestigia sunt quando per phantasticas illusiones circa rerum\r\nimmutationem sensibus humanis arte daemoniaca illuditur.”\r\n\r\n[22] Migne, PL 177, 13-164, “Hugo Raynero suo salutem.

As Hugh came from Saxony to Paris\r\nand Abelard went forth from his native Brittany through the towns of\r\nFrance in quest of Christian teachers, so Adelard, leaving not only his\r\nhome in England but the schools of Gaul where he had been teaching,\r\nmade a much more extensive intellectual pilgrimage even to lands\r\nMohammedan. “It is worth while,” he declares in one of his works, “to\r\nvisit learned men of different nations, and to remember whatever you\r\nfind is most excellent in each case. For what the schools of Gaul do\r\nnot know, those beyond the Alps reveal; what you do not learn among\r\nthe Latins, well-informed Greece will teach you.”[27] Adelard seems to\r\nhave devoted himself especially to Arabian learning and to have made\r\na number of translations from the Arabic, continuing at the beginning\r\nof the twelfth century that transfer of Graeco-Arabic science which we\r\nhave associated with the name of Gerbert in the tenth century and which\r\nConstantinus Africanus carried on in the eleventh century. Adelard\r\nhimself hints that some of his new ideas are not derived from his\r\nArabian masters but are his own, and Haskins has well characterized him\r\nas a pioneer in the study of natural science.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Some dates in his career.]\r\n\r\nAdelard has been described as “a dim and shadowy figure in the history\r\nof European learning,”[28] and the dates of his birth and death\r\nare unknown. We possess, however, a number of his works and some\r\nmay be either approximately or exactly dated. In the preface to his\r\ntranslation of the astronomical tables of Al-Khowarizmi he seems to\r\ngive the year as 1126.[29] The Pipe Roll for 1130 informs us that\r\nAdelard received four shillings and six pence at that time from the\r\nsheriff of Wiltshire. This suggests that he was in the employ of the\r\nking’s court,[30] and his brief treatise on the astrolabe seems to\r\nbe dedicated to Prince Henry Plantagenet,[31] later Henry II, and to\r\nhave been written between 1142 and 1146. It was probably one of his\r\nlast works and in it he mentions specifically three earlier works.[32]\r\nTwo other writings, which are the best known and apparently the most\r\noriginal of his works, namely the _Questiones naturales_ and _De eodem\r\net diverso_, may be dated approximately from the fact that they are\r\ndedicated respectively to Richard, Bishop of Bayeux from 1107 to 1133,\r\nand to William, Bishop of Syracuse, who died in 1115 or 1116. Both\r\nworks are addressed to Adelard’s nephew, who is presumably the same\r\nperson in both cases, one in the form of a letter, the other of a\r\nconversation, and both justify Adelard’s studies in foreign lands. In\r\nan appendix to this chapter the question when these two treatises were\r\nwritten and their relations to each other will be discussed more fully.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mathematical treatises.]\r\n\r\nThe subjects of a majority of Adelard’s known works and translations\r\nare mathematical or astronomical. The most elementary is a treatise\r\non the abacus, _Regule abaci_,[33] in which his chief authorities\r\nare Boethius and Gerbert and he seems as yet unacquainted with\r\nArabic mathematics.[34] But most of the mathematical treatises\r\nextant under Adelard’s name are from the Arabic, such as his\r\ntranslation of Euclid’s _Elements_;[35] of the astronomical tables\r\nof Al-Khowarizmi--who flourished under the patronage of the caliph\r\nAl-Mamum (813-833)--“apparently as revised by Maslama at Cordova,”\r\nunder the title _Liber Ezich_; and, if by a “Master A” Adelard is\r\nmeant, of a treatise of the first half of the twelfth century on the\r\nfour arts of the quadrivium and especially on astronomy, which is\r\napparently also a work of Al-Khowarizmi.[36] Some of the introductory\r\nbooks on the quadrivium have been printed,[37] but “the astronomical\r\ntreatise has not yet been specially studied.”[38] One therefore cannot\r\nsay how far it may indulge in astrology, but we are told that Adelard\r\ntranslated from the Arabic another “astrological treatise, evidently\r\nof Abu Ma’ashar Dja’afar,”[39] or Albumasar. We have already mentioned\r\nin another chapter the ascription to Adelard of one Latin translation\r\nof the superstitious work of Thebit ben Corat on astrological images,\r\nand in the present chapter the treatise on the astrolabe for Henry\r\nPlantagenet.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Adelard and alchemy.]\r\n\r\nAdelard was interested in alchemy as well as astrology and magic,\r\nif the attribution to him in a thirteenth century manuscript[40] of\r\nthe twelfth century version of the _Mappe clavicula_ is correct. We\r\nhave seen that the original version of that work was much older than\r\nAdelard’s time, but he perhaps made additions to it, or translated\r\na fuller Arabic version. The occurrence of some Arabic and English\r\nwords in certain chapters of the later copies are perhaps signs of his\r\ncontributions. Berthelot, however, thought that few of the new items in\r\nthe twelfth century version originated with Adelard and that many of\r\nthe additions were taken by him, or by whoever was responsible for the\r\nlater version, from Greek rather than Arabic sources.[41]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Importance of the _Natural Questions_.]\r\n\r\nOur attention will be devoted chiefly to the two treatises by Adelard\r\nwhich we have already mentioned as the most original of his works.\r\nOf these the _Natural Questions_ are evidently much more important\r\nthan the _De eodem et diverso_, which is largely taken up with a\r\njustification, in the style of allegorical personification made so\r\npopular by Martianus Capella and Boethius, and with much use of Plato’s\r\n_Timaeus_, of the seven liberal arts against the five worldly interests\r\nof wealth, power, ambition, dignities, and pleasure. The _Natural\r\nQuestions_, although put into a dramatic dialogue form somewhat\r\nreminiscent of Plato, deal without much persiflage with a number of\r\nconcrete problems of natural science to which definite answers are\r\nattempted.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Occasion of writing.]\r\n\r\nAdelard opens the _Natural Questions_ with brief allusion to the\r\npleasant reunion with the friends who greeted him upon his return to\r\nEngland in the reign of Henry I after long absence from his native\r\nland for the sake of study. After the usual inquiries had been made\r\nconcerning one another’s health and that of their friends, Adelard\r\nasked about “the morals of our nation,” only to learn that “princes\r\nwere violent, prelates wine-bibbers, judges mercenary, patrons\r\ninconstant, the common men flatterers, promise-makers false, friends\r\nenvious, and everyone in general ambitious.” Adelard declared that he\r\nhad no intention of conforming to this wretched state of affairs, and\r\nwhen asked what he did intend to do, since he would not practice and\r\ncould not prevent such “moral depravity,” replied that he intended\r\nto ignore it, “for oblivion is the only remedy for insurmountable\r\nills.” Accordingly that subject was dropped, and presently his nephew\r\nsuggested and the others joined in urging that he disclose to them\r\n“something new from my Arabian studies.”[42] From the sordid practical\r\nworld back to the pure light and ideals of science and philosophy! Such\r\nhas been the frequent refrain of our authors from Vitruvius and Galen,\r\nfrom Firmicus and Boethius on. It is further enlarged upon by Adelard\r\nin the _De eodem et diverso_; it has not quite lost its force even\r\ntoday; and parallels to Adelard’s twelfth century lament on England’s\r\ngoing to the dogs may be found in after-the-war letters to _The London\r\nTimes_ of 1919.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Arabic versus Gallic learning.]\r\n\r\nThe result of the request preferred by Adelard’s friends is the present\r\ntreatise in the form of a dialogue with his nephew, who proposes by a\r\nsuccession of questions to force his uncle to justify his preference\r\nfor “the opinions of the Saracens” over those of the Christian “schools\r\nof Gaul” where the nephew has pursued his studies. The nephew is\r\ndescribed as “interested rather than expert in natural science”[43] in\r\nthe _Natural Questions_, while a passage in the _De eodem et diverso_\r\nimplies that his training in Gaul had been largely of the usual\r\nrhetorical and dialectical character, since Adelard says to him, “Do\r\nyou keep watch whether I speak aright, observing that modest silence\r\nwhich is your custom amidst the wordy war of sophisms and the affected\r\nlocutions of rhetoric.”[44] In the _Natural Questions_ the nephew, as\r\nbefits his now maturer years, has more to say, raising some objections\r\nand stating some theories as well as propounding his questions, but\r\nAdelard’s answers constitute the bulk of the book. Beginning with\r\nearth and plants, the questions range in an ascending scale through\r\nthe lower animals to human physiology and psychology and then to the\r\ngrander cosmic phenomena of sea, air, and sky.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: “Modern discoveries.”]\r\n\r\nIn agreeing to follow this method of question and answer Adelard\r\nexplains at the start that on account of the prejudice of the present\r\ngeneration against any _modern_[45] discoveries he will attribute\r\neven his own ideas to someone else, and that, if what he says proves\r\ndispleasing to less advanced students because unfamiliar, the blame\r\nfor this should be attached to the Arabs and not to himself. “For I am\r\naware what misfortunes pursue the professors of truth among the common\r\ncrowd. Therefore it is the cause of the Arabs that I plead, not my\r\nown.”[46] This is a very interesting passage in more ways than one.\r\nAdelard appears as an exponent of the new scientific school, stimulated\r\nby contact with Arabian culture. He is confident that he has valuable\r\nnew truth, but is less confident as to the reception which it will\r\nreceive. The hostility, however, in the Latin learned world is not, as\r\none might expect, to Mohammedan learning. The process of taking over\r\nArabic learning has apparently already begun--as indeed we have seen\r\nfrom our previous chapters--and Adelard’s Christian friends are ready\r\nenough to hear what he has learned in Mohammedan lands and schools,\r\nalthough of course they may not accept it after they have heard it.\r\nBut he fears that he “would not get a hearing at all,” if he should\r\nput forward new views as his own. Indeed, he himself shows a similar\r\nprejudice against other novelties than his own in a passage in the\r\n_De eodem_, where he speaks impatiently and contemptuously of “those\r\nwho harass our ears with daily novelties” and of “the new Platos and\r\nAristotles to whom each day gives birth, who with unblushing front\r\nproclaim alike things which they know and of which they know nothing,\r\nand whose supreme trust is in extreme verbosity.”[47] Adelard of course\r\nregarded his own new ideas as of more solid worth than these, but the\r\nfact remains that he was not after all the only one who was interested\r\nin promulgating novelties. Yet his justification for writing the _De\r\neodem_ is the silence of “the science of the moderns” compared with the\r\nfluency of the ancients, of whose famous writings he has read “not all,\r\nbut the greater part.”[48] It is not necessary, of course, to regard\r\nthis passage and the preceding as inconsistent, but it is well to read\r\nthe one in the light of the other.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Medieval work wrongly credited to Greek and Arab.]\r\n\r\nBut let us return to the passage from the _Natural Questions_ and\r\nAdelard’s insinuation--slightly satirical no doubt, but also in part\r\nserious--that he has fathered new scientific notions of his own upon\r\nthe Arabs. There is reason to think that he was not the only one to do\r\nthis. Not only were superstitious and comparatively worthless treatises\r\nwhich were composed in the medieval period attributed to Aristotle and\r\nother famous authors, but this was also the case with works of real\r\nvalue. Also the number is suspiciously large of works of which the\r\nlost originals were supposedly by Greek or Arabian authors but which\r\nare extant only in later Latin “translations.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Illustrated from the history of alchemy.]\r\n\r\nThis point may be specifically illustrated for the moment from the\r\nresearches of Berthelot among alchemistic manuscripts, which have\r\ndemonstrated that Latin alchemy of the thirteenth century was less\r\nsuperstitious and more scientific than in previous periods, whether\r\namong the ancient Greeks or more recent Arabs. He found but one\r\ntreatise in Arabic which contained precise and minute details about\r\nchemical substances and operations. As a rule the Arabian alchemists\r\nwrote “theoretical works full of allegories and declamation.” For a\r\nlong time several works, important in the history of chemistry as\r\nwell as of alchemy, were regarded as Latin translations of the Arab,\r\nGeber. But Berthelot discovered the Arabic manuscripts of the real\r\nGeber, which turned out to be of little value and largely copied from\r\nGreek authors. On the other hand, the Latin works which had gone\r\nunder Geber’s name were produced in the thirteenth and fourteenth\r\ncenturies by men who seem, like Adelard of Bath, to have preferred\r\nto ascribe their own ideas to the Arabs. Let us examine for a moment\r\nwith Berthelot[49] the chief of these Latin treatises. It is a “a\r\nsystematic work, very well arranged. Its modest method of exposition”\r\ndiffers greatly from “the vague and excessive promises of the real\r\nGeber.” Much of the book possesses “a truly scientific character” and\r\n“shows the state of chemical knowledge with a precision of thought and\r\nexpression unknown to previous authors.” As for Adelard’s new ideas,\r\nwe may not regard them as so novel as they seemed to him, nor estimate\r\nthem so highly in comparison with ancient Greek science as Berthelot\r\ndid medieval compared with Greek alchemy--much of Adelard’s thought may\r\nbe derived by him from those ancient writings in which he claims to\r\nhave read so widely--but they were probably as new to Adelard’s Latin\r\ncontemporaries as they were to himself.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Science and religion.]\r\n\r\nWhile Adelard’s English friends displayed no bigoted opposition to the\r\nreception of Saracen science, the question of science and religion\r\nis raised in another connection in the very first of the questions\r\nconcerning nature which the nephew puts to his uncle. The nephew\r\ninquires the reason for the growth of herbs from earth, asking, “To\r\nwhat else can you attribute this save to the marvelous effect of\r\nthe marvelous divine will?” Adelard retorts that no doubt it is the\r\nCreator’s will, but that the operation is also not without a natural\r\nreason. This attitude of independent scientific investigation is\r\ncharacteristic of Adelard. Again in the fourth chapter when the nephew\r\ndisplays a tendency to ascribe all effects to God indifferently as\r\ncause, Adelard objects. He insists that he is detracting in no way from\r\nGod, whom he grants to be the source of all things, but he holds that\r\nnature “is not confused and without system” and that “human science\r\nshould be given a hearing upon those points which it has covered.” On\r\nthe other hand he has no desire in the present treatise to overstep the\r\nbounds of natural science and enter the field of theology. When his\r\nnephew towards the close wishes him to go on and discuss the problem of\r\nGod’s existence and nature, he wisely responds, “You are now broaching\r\na question to me where it is easier to disprove what isn’t so than to\r\ndemonstrate what is,”[50] and that they had better go to bed and leave\r\nthis big question for another day and another treatise.[51]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Reason versus authority.]\r\n\r\nBesides preferring the learning of Arabian and other distant lands to\r\nthe schools of Gaul, and favoring scientific investigation rather than\r\nunquestioning faith, Adelard also sets reason above authority. He not\r\nonly complains of his generation’s inborn prejudice against new ideas,\r\nbut later on, when his nephew proposes to turn his questions from the\r\nsubject of plants to that of animals, enters upon a longer diatribe\r\nagainst scholastic reliance upon past authorities. “It is difficult for\r\nme to discuss animals with you. For I learned from my Arabian masters\r\nunder the leading of reason; you, however, captivated by the appearance\r\nof authority, follow your halter. Since what else should authority be\r\ncalled than a halter? For just as brutes are led where one wills by a\r\nhalter, so the authority of past writers leads not a few of you into\r\ndanger, held and bound as you are by bestial credulity. Consequently\r\nsome, usurping to themselves the name of authority, have used excessive\r\nlicense in writing, so that they have not hesitated to teach bestial\r\nmen falsehood in place of truth. For why shouldn’t you fill rolls of\r\nparchment and write on both sides, when in this age you generally\r\nhave auditors who demand no rational judgment but trust simply in the\r\nmention of an old title?”[52] Adelard adds that those who are now\r\nreckoned authorities gained credence in the first instance by following\r\nreason, asserts that authority alone is not enough to convince, and\r\nconcludes with the ultimatum to his nephew: “Wherefore, if you want to\r\nhear anything more from me, give and take reason. For I’m not the sort\r\nof man that can be fed on a picture of a beefsteak.”[53]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Need of the telescope and microscope already felt.]\r\n\r\nThe history of natural philosophy and science has demonstrated that the\r\nunaided human reason has not been equal to the solution of the problems\r\nof the natural universe, and that elaborate and extensive observation,\r\nexperience, and measurement of the natural phenomena are essential.\r\nBut exact scientific measurement was not possible with the unaided\r\nhuman senses and required the invention of scientific instruments.\r\nAs Adelard says in _De eodem et diverso_, “The senses are reliable\r\nneither in respect to the greatest nor the smallest objects. Who has\r\never comprehended the space of the sky with the sense of sight?... Who\r\nhas ever distinguished minute atoms with the eye?”[54] Notable natural\r\nquestions these, showing that the need of the telescope and microscope\r\nwas already felt and that the discovery must in due time follow!\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Some quaint speculative science.]\r\n\r\nWe must not, therefore, unduly blame Adelard for placing, like the\r\nGreek philosophers before him, somewhat excessive trust in human reason\r\nand believing that “nothing is surer than reason, nothing falser\r\nthan the senses.”[55] But in consequence much of his discussion is\r\nstill in the speculative stage, and uncle as well as nephew shows the\r\ninfluence of dialectical training. Some quaint and amusing instances\r\nmay be given. Asked why men do not have horns like some other animals,\r\nAdelard at first objects to the question as trivial; but when his\r\nnephew urges the utility of horns as weapons of defence, he replies\r\nthat man has reason instead of horns, and that, as a social as well as\r\nbellicose animal, man requires weapons which he can lay aside in times\r\nof peace.[56] Asked why the nose, with its impurities, is placed above\r\nthe mouth, through which we eat, Adelard answers that nothing in nature\r\nis impure, and that the nose serves the head and so should be above\r\nthe mouth which serves the stomach.[57] Such arguing from the fitness\r\nof things and from design was common in the Greek philosophers whom\r\nAdelard had read, and in judging his treatise we must compare it with\r\nsuch books as the _Saturnalia_ of Macrobius which he cites,[58] the\r\n_Natural Questions_ of Seneca, Plato’s _Timaeus_, and the _Problems_ of\r\nAristotle,[59] rather than with works of modern science.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Warfare, science, and religion.]\r\n\r\nIt is noteworthy, however, even in these two amusing instances that\r\nthe argument from design is questioned, while the question about horns\r\nAdelard perhaps inserted as a sly hit against the militarism of the\r\nfeudal age. Little recked he of the horrible substitutes for horns\r\nthat twentieth century warfare would work out with the aid of modern\r\nscience. The medieval church has too often been wildly accused of\r\npersecuting natural scientists and it has been erroneously stated that\r\nRoger Bacon dared not reveal the secret of the mariner’s compass--which\r\nreally was well known before his time--for fear of being accused of\r\nmagic.[60] There is somewhat more plausibility in the theory that he\r\nconcealed the invention of gunpowder from fear of the inquisition,[61]\r\nsince there appears to have been a certain medieval prejudice against\r\ninhuman war inventions, which historians of artillery somewhat\r\nimpatiently ascribe to “ignorance, religion, and chivalry,” and which\r\nthey hold prevented the use of Greek fire in the west.[62] At any rate\r\nin Adelard’s day the Second Lateran Council attempted to prohibit the\r\nuse of military engines against men on the ground that they were too\r\nmurderous.[63]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Specimens of medieval scientific curiosity.]\r\n\r\nReturning to the _Natural Questions_, we may note that, like the\r\n_Problems_ of Aristotle, they vary from such crude queries as might\r\noccur to any curious person without scientific training to others that\r\nimply some previous theory or knowledge. A list of some of them will\r\nillustrate the scope of the scientific curiosity of the time. When one\r\ntree is grafted upon another, why is all the fruit of the nature of\r\nthe grafted portion? Why do some brutes ruminate; why are some animals\r\nwithout stomachs; and why do some which drink make no water? Why do\r\nmen grow bald in front? Why do some animals see better in the night\r\nthan in the day and why can a man standing in the dark see objects\r\nthat are in the light, while a man standing in the light cannot see\r\nobjects that are in the dark? Why are the fingers of the human hand\r\nof unequal length and the palm hollow? Why don’t babies walk as soon\r\nas they are born, and why are they at first nourished upon milk, and\r\nwhy doesn’t milk agree equally with old and young? Why do we fear dead\r\nbodies?[64] A number of questions are devoted to each of the topics,\r\nvision, hearing, and heat, while the senses of taste, smell, and touch\r\nare dismissed in a single question and answer.[65]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Theory of sound.]\r\n\r\nThe discussion of sound and vision may be noted more fully. The nephew\r\nhas already learned from his Boethius something similar to the wave\r\ntheory of sound. He states that when the air has been formed by the\r\nmouth of the speaker and impelled by the tongue, it impresses the same\r\nform upon that which is next to it, and that this process is repeated\r\nover and over just as concentric circles are formed when a stone is\r\nthrown into water.[66] Vitruvius had given the same explanation in\r\ndiscussing the acoustics of a theater.[67] But when the nephew asks\r\nhis uncle how the voice can penetrate an iron wall, Adelard replies\r\nthat every metal body, no matter how solid, has some pores through\r\nwhich the air can pass.[68] Thus he appears to regard air as the only\r\nsubstance which can transmit or conduct sound waves. His notion that\r\nair can pass through solids reminds one a little of the milder theory\r\nof Hero of Alexandria that heat and light consist of material particles\r\nwhich penetrate the interstices between the atoms composing air and\r\nwater.[69] But it hardly seems as if Adelard could have derived _his_\r\nnotion from Hero, since the impermeability of metal vessels to air is a\r\nfundamental hypothesis in many of the devices of Hero’s _Pneumatics_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Theory of vision.]\r\n\r\nAdelard’s theory of vision, that of extramission of “a visible spirit,”\r\nis similar to that of Plato in the _Timaeus_, by which he was not\r\nunlikely influenced. The visible spirit passes from the brain to the\r\neye through “concave nerves which the Greeks call optic,” and from the\r\neye to the object seen and back again “with marvelous celerity.”[70]\r\nIt would be interesting to know certainly whether Adelard penned this\r\npassage before John of Spain translated into Latin the _De differentia\r\nspiritus et animae_, in which Costa ben Luca speaks of “hollow nerves”\r\nfrom the brain to the eye through which the _spiritus_ passes for the\r\npurpose of vision.[71] Apparently Adelard was first, since the _Natural\r\nQuestions_ were finished at some time between 1107 and 1133, while\r\nJohn of Spain is said to have made his translation for Raymond who was\r\narchbishop of Toledo from 1130 to 1150. Were the manuscripts not so\r\ninsistent in naming John as translator,[72] we might think that Adelard\r\nhad translated the _De differentia spiritus et animae_. Very possibly\r\nhe had come across it during his study with Arabian masters. But he\r\nshows no acquaintance with the optical researches of Al-Hazen or with\r\nthe treatise on _Optics_ ascribed to Ptolemy, which last is extant only\r\nin the twelfth century Latin translation by Eugene of Palermo, admiral\r\nof Sicily.[73] However, the fact that three other theories of vision\r\nthan the one which Adelard accepts are set forth by his nephew suggests\r\nthat the problem was attracting attention. Pliny’s _Natural History_\r\ngave no theory of vision whatever, although he listed various cases of\r\nextraordinary sight. Boethius, on the other hand, briefly adverted to\r\nthe opposing theories of vision by extramission and intramission in the\r\nfirst chapter of his work on music. As for the marvelous celerity of\r\nthe visible spirit, Augustine had enlarged upon the vast distance to\r\nthe sun and back traveled by the visual ray in an instant or twinkling\r\nof an eye.[74]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Deductive reasoning from hot and cold, moist and dry.]\r\n\r\nThroughout the _Natural Questions_ Adelard’s explanations and answers\r\nare based in large measure upon the familiar hypothesis of the four\r\nelements and of the four qualities, hot and cold, dry and moist. When\r\nasked, for instance, why all ruminating animals begin to lie down with\r\ntheir hind legs, he explains that their scanty animal heat is the\r\ncause of their ruminating to aid digestion, and that there is more\r\nfrigidity in their posterior members, which are consequently heavier\r\nand so are bent first in reclining. The nephew thinks that here he\r\nhas caught his uncle napping, and asks why is it then that in rising\r\nthey lift themselves first onto their hind legs. But Adelard is not to\r\nbe so easily nonplussed, and explains that after they have lain down\r\nand rested, they feel so refreshed that they lift their heavier limbs\r\nfirst.[75] Again, asked why persons of quick perception often have\r\nfaulty memories, Adelard suggests that a moist brain is more conducive\r\nto intelligence, but a dry one to memory. Thus moist potter’s clay\r\nreceives impressions more readily but also easily loses them; what is\r\ndrier receives the impression with more difficulty but retains it.[76]\r\nIn a third passage, Adelard explains his nephew’s weeping in his joy\r\nat seeing his uncle safely returned by the theory that his excessive\r\ndelight overheated his brain and distilled moisture thence.[77]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Refinement of the four elements hypothesis.]\r\n\r\nAdelard, however, like Galen, Constantinus Africanus, Basil, and\r\nother writers before him, finds it advisable to refine the theory of\r\nthe four elements. He is at pains in his answer to the nephew’s very\r\nfirst question to explain that what we commonly call earth is not the\r\nelement earth, and that no one ever touched the pure element water, or\r\nsaw the elements air and fire. Every particular object contains all\r\nfour elements and we deal in daily life only with compounds. In an\r\nherb, for instance, unless there were fire, there would be no growth\r\nupward; unless there were water or air, no spreading out; and without\r\nearth, no consistency. Moreover, when Adelard is asked why some herbs\r\nare spoken of as hot by nature, although all plants have more earth\r\nthan fire in their composition, he says that while earth predominates\r\nquantitatively, efficaciously they are more fiery, just as his green\r\ncloak is larger than his green emerald, but much less potent.[78] Thus\r\ncomes in the theory of occult virtue to help out the inadequate and\r\nunsatisfactory hypothesis of four elements and four qualities. We shall\r\nfind our subsequent authors often resorting to the same explanation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Animal intelligence doubted.]\r\n\r\nAdelard may believe in the marvelous virtue of emeralds, to which\r\nindeed he alludes rather inadvertently, but we do not find in the\r\n_Natural Questions_ any of the common tales concerning remarkable\r\nanimal sagacity or malice. This may be mere accident or it may be due\r\nto his warning in introducing the discussion of animals to give and\r\ntake reason only. However, the question is discussed whether the brutes\r\npossess souls,[79] and he states that the common people are sure that\r\nthey do not, and that only philosophers assert that animals have souls.\r\nThis does not mean that their souls are rational, however: either\r\nanimals possess “neither intelligence nor discretion but only opinion\r\nwhich is founded not in the soul but in the body”; or perhaps they\r\nhave “some judgment why they seek and avoid certain things,” and such\r\ndiscretion of sense as enables a dog to distinguish scents. If they\r\npossess such animal souls, do these perish with the body?\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The earth’s shape and center of gravity.]\r\n\r\nAdelard is correctly informed as to the shape of the earth and its\r\ncenter of gravity. Asked how the terrestrial globe is upheld in the\r\nmidst of space, he retorts that in a round space it is evident that\r\nthe center and the bottom are the same.[80] This thought is reinforced\r\nby the next question, If there were a hole clear through the earth\r\nand a stone were dropped in, how far would it fall? Adelard correctly\r\nanswers, Only to the center of the earth. The same question is asked\r\nof Adelard by a Greek in the _De eodem et diverso_, so that, in case\r\nwe regard the _De eodem_ as written before the _Natural Questions_,\r\nit would appear that he had not derived his conclusion in this matter\r\nfrom either the Greeks or the Arabs. However, we have heard Plutarch\r\nscoff at the statement that bars weighing a thousand talents would stop\r\nfalling at the earth’s center, if a hole were opened up through the\r\nearth.[81]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Indestructibility of matter.]\r\n\r\nIn a recent review of Sir William Ramsay’s _The Life and Letters of\r\nJoseph Black, M.D._, it is stated, “The nature of the experiment he\r\n(Black) made is not now known, but his tremendous comment on it was,\r\n‘Nothing escapes!’ Have we here really the first glimmering of the\r\ngreat principle of the indestructibility of matter which, with the\r\nassociated principle regarding energy, forms the foundation of modern\r\nchemistry and physics?”[82] To this the answer is, “No.” Adelard of\r\nBath stated the indestructibility of matter eight centuries earlier,\r\nand apparently not as the result of any experiment. But his utterance\r\nwas fuller and more explicit than that of Black. “And certainly in my\r\njudgment nothing in this world of sense ever perishes utterly, or is\r\nless today than when it was created. If any part is dissolved from one\r\nunion, it does not perish but is joined to some other group.”[83]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Also stated by Hugh of St. Victor.]\r\n\r\nThe indestructibility of matter is also stated by Adelard’s\r\ncontemporary, Hugh of St. Victor, who remarks in the _Didascalicon_\r\nthat of earthly things which have a beginning and an end “it has\r\nbeen said, ‘Nothing in the universe ever dies because no essence\r\nperishes.’ For the essences of things do not change, but the forms.\r\nAnd when a form is said to change, it should not be so understood\r\nthat any existing thing is believed to perish utterly and lose its\r\nbeing, but only to undergo alteration, either perchance so that those\r\nthings which were joined are separated, or those joined which had\r\nbeen separated....”[84] Hugh was quite certainly a younger man than\r\nAdelard, but it is not so certain that the _Didascalicon_ was written\r\nafter the _Natural Questions_, although it is probable. Or Hugh may\r\nhave heard Adelard lecture in Gaul or learned his view concerning the\r\nindestructibility of matter indirectly. Or they both may have drawn it\r\nindependently from a common source.[85]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Roger Bacon’s continuity of universal nature.]\r\n\r\nIn an article entitled _Roger Bacon et l’Horreur du Vide_[86] Professor\r\nPierre Duhem advanced the thesis that in place of the previous doctrine\r\nthat nature abhors a vacuum Roger Bacon was the first to formulate\r\na theory of universal continuity. This was an incorrect hypothesis,\r\nit is true, but one which Professor Duhem believed to have served\r\nthe useful purpose of supplementing “the Peripatetic theory of heavy\r\nand light” until the discovery of atmospheric pressure. This theory\r\ndeveloped in connection with certain problematical phenomena of\r\nwhich this “experiment” is the chief and typical case. If there be\r\nsuspended in air a vessel of water having a hole in the top and several\r\nnarrow apertures in the bottom, no water will fall from it as long as\r\nthe superior aperture is closed. Yet water is heavier than air and\r\naccording to the principles of Aristotle’s _Physics_ should fall to the\r\nground. Writers before Roger Bacon, according to Duhem, explain this\r\nanomaly by saying that the fall of the water would produce a vacuum and\r\nthat a vacuum cannot exist in nature. But Bacon argues that a vacuum\r\ncannot be the reason why the water does not fall, because a vacuum does\r\nnot exist; he then explains further that although by their particular\r\nnatures water tends downwards and air upwards, by their nature as\r\nparts of the universe they tend to remain in continuity. Duhem held\r\nthat Roger Bacon was the first to substitute this positive law of\r\nuniversal continuity for the mere negation that a vacuum cannot exist\r\nin nature.[87]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Previously stated by Adelard.]\r\n\r\nProfessor Duhem supported his case by citation of Greek, Byzantine,\r\nand Arabic sources and by use of writings of fourteenth century\r\nphysicists available only in manuscripts. But unfortunately for his\r\nmain contention he overlooked a remarkable passage written by Adelard\r\nof Bath over a century before Roger Bacon. In the fifty-eighth chapter\r\nof the _Natural Questions_ the nephew says, “There is still one point\r\nabout the natures of waters which is unclear to me.” He then asks his\r\nuncle to explain a water jar, similar to that just described, which\r\nthey had once seen at the house of an enchantress. Adelard replies in\r\nhis clear, easy style, so different from the scholastic discussion in\r\nBacon’s corresponding passages. “If it was magic, the enchantment was\r\nworked by violence of nature rather than of waters. For although four\r\nelements compose the body of this world of sense, they are so united\r\nby natural affection that, as no one of them desires to exist without\r\nanother, so no place is or can be void of them. Therefore immediately\r\none of them leaves its position, another succeeds it without interval,\r\nnor can one leave its place unless some other which is especially\r\nattached to it can succeed it.” Hence it is futile to give the water\r\na chance to escape unless you give the air a chance to enter. Be it\r\nnoted that Adelard not only thus anticipates the theory of universal\r\ncontinuity, but also in the last clause of the quotation approaches the\r\ndoctrine of chemical affinity in the formation and disintegration of\r\nmolecules. Finally, he describes what actually occurs in the experiment\r\nmore accurately than Roger Bacon or the other physicists cited by\r\nDuhem. “Hence it comes about that, if in a vessel which is absolutely\r\ntight above an aperture is made below, the liquid flows out only\r\ninterruptedly and with bubbling. For as much air gets in as liquid\r\ngoes out, and this air, since it finds the water porous, by its own\r\nproperties of tenuity and lightness makes its way to the top of the\r\nvessel and occupies what seems to be a vacuum.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Experiment and magic.]\r\n\r\nThis detailed and accurate description of exactly what takes place\r\nshows us Adelard’s powers of observation and experiment at their best,\r\nand compares favorably with two cruder examples of experimentation\r\nwhich he ascribes to others. He states that it was discovered\r\nexperimentally which portion of the brain is devoted to the imagination\r\nand which parts to reason and memory through a case in which a man\r\nwas injured in the front part of the head.[88] In the other instance\r\nsome philosophers, in order to study the veins and muscles of the\r\nhuman body, bound a corpse in running water until all the flesh\r\nhad been removed by the current.[89] But the question remains, how\r\noften did Abelard exercise his powers of accurate observation by\r\nactual experiments? Certainly one thing is noteworthy, that the best\r\nand almost sole experiment that he details is represented by him\r\nas suggested by the magic water jar of an enchantress. Thus we are\r\nonce again impelled to the conclusion that experimental method owes\r\na considerable debt to magic, and that magic owed a great deal to\r\nexperimental method.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Adelard and Hero of Alexandria.]\r\n\r\nWe are also reminded of the association of similar water-jars with\r\nthaumaturgy in the _Pneumatics_ of Hero of Alexandria.[90] It will\r\nbe noted that Adelard is content with a single illustration of the\r\nprinciple involved, while Hero kept reintroducing instances of it. And\r\nwhile Hero gave little more than practical directions, Adelard gives\r\na philosophical interpretation of and scientific deduction from the\r\nexperiment. But he also describes what actually occurs more accurately,\r\nadmitting that some liquid will gradually flow out even when the\r\nair-hole is kept closed. Here again, as in the case of the theory of\r\nthe penetration of the particles of one substance between those of\r\nanother mentioned in our paragraph above on the theory of sound, it\r\nis difficult to say whether Adelard was acquainted with Hero’s works.\r\nProbably it is only chance that Hero’s _Pneumatics_ seems to contain\r\nalmost exactly the same number of theorems as Adelard’s _Natural\r\nQuestions_ has chapters.[91]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Attitude to the stars: _De eodem et diverso_.]\r\n\r\nIt remains to consider Adelard’s attitude towards the stars, which is\r\nvery similar to that of Plato’s _Timaeus_. We have already seen that\r\nhe translated works of Arabic astrology. Such a work as the tables of\r\nAl-Khowarizmi evidently has an astrological purpose, enabling one to\r\nfind the horoscope accurately. In the _De eodem et diverso_ he calls\r\nthe celestial bodies “those superior and divine animals,” and “the\r\ncauses and principle of inferior natures.” One who masters the science\r\nof astronomy can comprehend not only the present state of inferior\r\nthings but also the past and the future.[92] The existence of music,\r\nsays Adelard in another passage, supplies philosophers with a strong\r\nargument for their belief that “the soul has descended into the body\r\nfrom the stars above.”[93] In the _De eodem et diverso_ Adelard also\r\nexpresses the belief that from present phenomena the mind can look\r\nahead far into the future, and that the soul can sometimes foresee the\r\nfuture in dreams.[94]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Attitude to the stars: _Questiones Naturales_.]\r\n\r\nIn the _Natural Questions_[95] Adelard again alludes to the stars as\r\n“those superior animals,” and when asked whether they are animated\r\nreplies that he deems anyone to be without sense who contends that\r\nthe stars are senseless, and that to call those bodies lifeless which\r\nproduce vitality in other bodies is ridiculous. He regards “the bodies\r\nof the stars” as composed of the same four elements as this world of\r\ninferior creation, but he believes that in their composition those\r\nelements predominate which conduce most to life and reason, and that\r\nthe celestial bodies are more fiery than terrestrial bodies. “But\r\ntheir fire is not harsh, but gentle and harmless. It therefore follows\r\nthat it is obedient to and in harmony with sense and reason.” Their\r\nform, too, being “full and round,” is especially adapted to reason.\r\nFinally, if reason and foresight exist even in our dark and perturbed\r\nlower world, how much more must the stars employ intelligence in\r\ntheir determined and constant courses? When the nephew proceeds to\r\ninquire what food the stars eat, since they are animals, Adelard shows\r\nno surprise, but answers that as diviner creatures they use a purer\r\nsustenance than we, namely, the humidities of earth and water which,\r\nextenuated and refined by their long upward transit, neither augment\r\nthe stars in weight nor dull their reason and prudence. But when the\r\nnephew asks whether the _aplanon_ or outermost and immovable sphere of\r\nheaven should be called God or not, Adelard answers that to assert this\r\nis in one sense philosophical but in another, insane and abominable,\r\nand he then avoids further discussion by terminating the treatise.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Astrology in an anonymous work, perhaps by Athelardus.]\r\n\r\nFor some reason, which I failed to discover, the catalogue of\r\nthe Cotton manuscripts in the British Museum, in describing “a\r\nphilosophical treatise concerning the principles of nature, the power\r\nof celestial influences on minds and morals, and other matters,”[96]\r\nstates that “the author seems to be Athelardus.” The treatise is\r\nperhaps of later date than Adelard of Bath, but as it would be equally\r\ndifficult to connect it with any other of our authors, we will give\r\nsome account of it now. It seems to be incomplete as it stands both\r\nat the beginning and end, but the main interest in the portion\r\npreserved to us is astrological. Authorities are cited such as Hermes\r\nTrismegistus, Theodosius, Ptolemy, Apollonius of Thebes, “Albateni,”\r\nand “Abumaxar.” Discussing the number of elements our author states\r\nthat medical men speak of the four parts of the inferior world, fire,\r\nair, water, earth,[97] but that astrologers make the number of the\r\nelements twelve, adding the eight parts of the superior world.[98]\r\nLater our author argues further for astrological influence as against\r\n“the narrow medical man who thinks of no effects of things except those\r\nof inferior nature merely.”[99] Our author holds that forms come from\r\nabove to matter here below, and discusses the influence of the sky on\r\nthe generation of humans and metals, plants and animals, and connects\r\nseven colors and seven metals with the planets.[100] He furthermore, in\r\nall probability following Albumasar in this, asserts that the course\r\nof history may be foretold by means of astrology and that different\r\nreligions go with different planets.[101] The Jews are under Saturn;\r\nthe Arabs, under Venus and Mars, which explains the warlike and sensual\r\ncharacter of their religion; the Christian Roman Empire, under the\r\nSun and Jupiter. “Ancient writers argue” and “present experience\r\nproves”[102] that the Sun stands for honesty, liberality, and victory;\r\nJupiter, for peace, equity, and humanity. The constant enmity between\r\nthe Jews and Christians, and Moslems and Christians, is explained by\r\nthe fact that neither Mars nor Saturn is ever in friendly relation\r\nwith Jupiter. These three religions also observe the days of the week\r\ncorresponding to their planets: the Christians, Sunday; the Moslems,\r\nFriday or Venus’s day; the Jews, Saturday. Our author also explains the\r\nworships of the Egyptians and Greeks by their relation to signs of the\r\nzodiac.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Authorities on spirits.]\r\n\r\nDespite the allusion just mentioned to “the experience of to-day,” our\r\nauthor perhaps shows too great a tendency to cite authorities to be\r\nthat Adelard of Bath who wished to give and take reason and reproved\r\nhis nephew for blind trust in authority. In discussing the theme of\r\nspirits and demons[103]--a different problem, it is true, from natural\r\nquestions--he thinks that “it is enough in these matters to have faith\r\nin the authority of those who, divinely illuminated, could penetrate\r\ninto things divine by the purer vision of the mind.” He proceeds\r\nto cite Apuleius and Trismegistus, Hermes in _The Golden Bough_,\r\n“Apollonius” in _The Secrets of Nature_, which he wrote alone in the\r\ndesert, and Aristotle who tells of a spirit of Venus who came to him in\r\na dream and instructed him as to the sacrifice which he should perform\r\nunder a certain constellation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Adelard’s future influence.]\r\n\r\nBut I would close this chapter on Adelard not with superstition from\r\na treatise of dubious authenticity, but rather with reaffirmation of\r\nthe importance in the long history of science of his brief work, the\r\n_Natural Questions_. Its probable effects upon Hugh of St. Victor and\r\nRoger Bacon are instances of its medieval influence to which we shall\r\nadd in subsequent chapters. But most impressive is the fact that within\r\nsuch compact compass it considers so many problems and topics that are\r\nstill of interest to modern science. For instance, its two concrete\r\nexamples of the stone dropped into a hole extending through the earth’s\r\ncenter and of the magic water jar have been common property ever since.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[26] For the _De eodem et diverso_ I have used the text printed for\r\nthe first time by H. Willner, _Des Adelard von Bath Traktat De eodem\r\net diverso, sum ersten Male herausgegeben und historischkritisch\r\nuntersucht_, Münster, 1903, in _Beiträge_, IV, i.\r\n\r\nFor the _Questiones naturales_ I have used the _editio princeps_ of\r\nLouvain, 1480 (?), and what is supposed to be the original MS at Eton\r\nCollege, 161, (Bl. 6. 16). I have also examined BN 2389, 12th century,\r\nfols. 65r-81v, _Questiones naturales_ from cap. 12 on; fols. 81v-90v,\r\n_De eodem et diverso_ (sole extant text); and BN 6415, 14th century,\r\nwhere Adelard’s _Natural Questions_ are found together with William of\r\nConches’ _Dragmaticon philosophiae_ and Bernard Silvester’s _Megacosmus\r\net microcosmus_, of which we treat in succeeding chapters. Professor H.\r\nGollancz has recently translated the Latin text into English for the\r\nfirst time in his _Dodi Ve-Nechdi_, the work of Berachya based upon\r\nAdelard’s and preserved in MSS at Oxford and Munich.\r\n\r\nFor Adelard’s translation of the _Liber Ezich_, or astronomical tables\r\nof Al-Khowarizmi (as revised by Maslama at Cordova), I have used H.\r\nSuter, _Die astronomischen Tafeln des Muhammed ibn Musa Al-Khwarizmi_,\r\nCopenhagen, 1914.\r\n\r\nFor further bibliography of Adelard’s writings see the articles on\r\n_Adelard of Bath_, by Professor C. H. Haskins in EHR 26 (1911) pp.\r\n491-8, and 28 (1913) 515-6.

Other uses of the word in _De eodem et\r\ndiverso_ to apply to his own age are: p. 3, line 3; p. 19, line 24; p.\r\n22, line 33.\r\n\r\nCassiodorus is said to be the first extant author to use _modernus_.\r\n\r\n[46] _Quest. nat., Proemium._ “Habet enim haec generatio ingenitum\r\nvitium ut nihil quod a modernis reperiatur putent esse recipiendum,\r\nunde fit ut si quando inventum proprium publicare voluerim, personae id\r\nalienae imponens inquam, ‘Quidam dixit, non ego’ Itaque--ne omnino non\r\naudiar--omnes meas sententias dans, ‘Quidam invenit, non ego.’ Sed haec\r\nhactenus.\r\n\r\n... hoc tamen vitato incommodo ne quis me ignota proferentem ex mea id\r\nsententia facere, verum arabicorum studiorum sensa putet proponere.\r\nNolo enim si quae dixero minus provectis displiciant, ego etiam eis\r\ndisplicere.

It is not even\r\nentirely certain which treatise was written first, as neither contains\r\nan unmistakable allusion to the other. On general grounds the _De\r\neodem et diverso_ would certainly seem the earlier work, but there are\r\nsome reasons for thinking the contrary. It seems clear that not many\r\nyears elapsed between the composition of the two works, but how many\r\nis uncertain. It is evident that the _De eodem et diverso_ must have\r\nbeen written by 1116 at the latest in order to dedicate it to William,\r\nbishop of Syracuse. But the _Questiones naturales_ apparently might\r\nhave been dedicated to Richard, bishop of Bayeux, at almost any time\r\nduring his pontificate from 1107 to 1133, although probably not long\r\nafter 1116.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Before what queen did Adelard play the _cithara_?]\r\n\r\nProfessor Haskins would narrow down the time during which the _De\r\neodem et diverso_ could have been written to the years from about\r\n1104 to 1109, with the single year 1116 as a further possibility. He\r\nsays, “Adelard speaks of having played the _cithara_ before the queen\r\nin the course of his musical studies in France the preceding year,\r\nand as there was no queen of France between the death of Philip I and\r\nthe marriage of Louis VI in 1115, the treatise, unless the bishop of\r\nSyracuse was still alive in 1116, would not be later than 1109.”[104]\r\nBut may not the queen referred to have been Matilda, the wife of Henry\r\nI?[105] She was a patroness both of artists and of men of letters, and\r\nthe Pipe Roll for 1130 and the treatise on the astrolabe have shown\r\nus that later, at least, it was the English royal family with which\r\nAdelard, himself an Englishman, was connected. It is of “Gaul,” not\r\nof “France” in the sense of territory subject to the French monarch,\r\nthat Adelard writes,[106] and Normandy was of course under Henry’s rule\r\nafter the battle of Tinchebrai in 1106.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Circumstances under which the _De eodem et diverso_ was\r\nwritten.]\r\n\r\nThe _De eodem et diverso_ takes the form of a letter[107] from Adelard\r\nto his nephew, justifying his “laborious itinerary” in pursuit of\r\nlearning against the reproach of “levity and inconstancy” made by the\r\nnephew, and stating “the cause of my travel among the learned men of\r\nvarious regions,” at which the nephew has time and again expressed his\r\nastonishment, and the reasons for which his uncle has kept concealed\r\nfrom him for two years.[108] This letter seems to have been written by\r\nAdelard in Sicily, since it is prefaced with a dedication to William,\r\nbishop of Syracuse, and since towards its close Adelard speaks of\r\n“coming from Salerno into Graecia maior”[109]--a phrase by which he\r\npresumably refers to the ancient Magna Graecia, or southern Italy, and\r\nperhaps also Sicily. In the preceding year, however, Adelard and his\r\nnephew had been together in Tours.[110] It thus appears that the _De\r\neodem_ was written not very long after Adelard set out on his quest for\r\nforeign learning, while he was still in the Greek or semi-Greek learned\r\nsociety of southern Italy and Sicily, and presumably before he had\r\ncome into contact with the science of the Saracens, which he does not\r\nmention in the _De eodem et diverso_, although traces of it undoubtedly\r\nlingered in Sicily. He writes as if the idea had only comparatively\r\nrecently come to him “that he could much broaden his education, if he\r\ncrossed the Alps and visited other teachers than those of Gaul.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Different situation depicted in the _Natural Questions_.]\r\n\r\nIn the _Natural Questions_, on the other hand, he returns to England\r\nafter seven years, instead of a single year, of separation from his\r\nnephew, after a visit to the principality of Antioch,[111] and after a\r\nconsiderable period of study among the Saracens or Arabs. It is rather\r\nnatural, however, to conclude that the same absence abroad is referred\r\nto in both treatises, and that Adelard wrote _De eodem et diverso_\r\nto his nephew after he had been absent a year, while the _Natural\r\nQuestions_ was composed after his return at the end of seven years.\r\nThus six years would separate the two treatises. But the _Natural\r\nQuestions_ depicts a different last parting of uncle and nephew from\r\nthat of _De eodem et diverso_. It does not allude to their having been\r\ntogether in Tours seven years ago, but reminds the nephew how, when\r\nhis uncle took leave of him and his other pupils at Laon seven years\r\nsince, it was agreed between them that while Adelard investigated\r\nArabian learning, his nephew should continue his studies in Gaul.[112]\r\nIn the _De eodem et diverso_, on the contrary, neither Laon nor the\r\nArabs nor any such agreement between uncle and nephew is mentioned.\r\nRather, the uncle seems to have at first kept secret the motives for\r\nhis crossing the Alps. It therefore may be that Adelard had returned\r\nfrom Sicily to Gaul and had taught at Laon for a short time before\r\nsetting out on a longer period of travel in quest of Arabian science.\r\nThis would agree well enough with his allusion to his nephew in the\r\n_De eodem et diverso_ as “still a boy,”[113] and the statement in the\r\n_Natural Questions_ that his nephew was “little more than a boy”[114]\r\nwhen he parted from him seven years before. In this case the _Natural\r\nQuestions_ would have been written more than seven years after the _De\r\neodem et diverso_. This is, I think, the most tenable and plausible\r\nhypothesis.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Some apparent indications that the _De eodem et diverso_ was\r\nwritten after the _Natural Questions_.]\r\n\r\nThere are, it is true, one or two circumstances which might be taken\r\nto indicate that the _De eodem et diverso_ was written after the\r\n_Questiones naturales_. In the sole manuscript of the _De eodem_ thus\r\nfar known[115] it follows that treatise, and its title _Of the same\r\nand different_ might be taken as a continuation with variations of the\r\ngeneral line of thought of the other treatise. But it is perhaps just\r\nbecause some copyist has so interpreted its title that it is put after\r\nthe _Natural Questions_ in this manuscript. At any rate in the text\r\nitself Adelard gives another explanation of its title, stating that it\r\nhas reference to the allegorical figures, Philosophia and Philocosmia,\r\nwho address him in his vision, and who, he says, are designated as\r\n_eadem_ and _diversa_ “by the prince of philosophers,”--an allusion\r\nperhaps to some of Aristotle’s pronouns.[116] Another curious\r\ncircumstance is that the problem, How far would a stone of great weight\r\nfall, if dropped in a hole extending through the earth at the center?\r\noccurs in both the _De eodem_ and _Natural Questions_.[117] In the\r\nlatter the nephew puts the query to his uncle: in the former a Grecian\r\nphilosopher whom Adelard has been questioning concerning the properties\r\nof the magnet in attracting iron, in his turn asks Adelard this\r\nquestion. Now in the _Natural Questions_ Adelard’s answer is given,\r\nas if the nephew had never heard it before, but in the _De eodem et\r\ndiverso_ it is simply stated that the Greek “listened to my explanation\r\nof this,” as if the nephew had already heard the explanation from his\r\nuncle.[118]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: How long had Henry I been reigning?]\r\n\r\nIn opening the _Natural Questions_ Adelard states that Henry I was\r\nreigning when he returned to England recently. This statement, in\r\nProfessor Haskins’ opinion, “would seem to imply that he originally\r\nleft England for his studies in France before Henry’s accession.” I am\r\nnot quite sure that this inference follows, but if it does, may one not\r\ngo a step further and argue that Henry I had come to the throne since\r\nAdelard parted from his nephew at Laon to investigate the learning of\r\nthe Arabs? Had Henry become king of England while Adelard was still\r\nstudying or teaching in northern Gaul, he would almost certainly have\r\nheard of it, and it would have been no news to him on his return from\r\nhis studies among the Arabs. If we accept this view, Adelard’s return\r\nto England would be not later than 1107. But it could scarcely be\r\nearlier, if he wrote and dedicated the _Natural Questions_ promptly\r\nafter his arrival, of which he speaks as a recent event in that work,\r\nsince the dedicatee did not become Bishop of Bayeux until 1107. And\r\nif the _De eodem et diverso_ was written more than seven years before\r\nthe _Natural Questions_, we should have to date it back into the\r\neleventh century, which would perhaps be too early for its dedication\r\nto William, bishop of Syracuse. And to put these two works so early\r\nis to leave a gap between them and the other known dates of Adelard’s\r\ncareer, 1126, 1130, and 1142-1146, and make the period of his literary\r\nproductivity quite a long one. He would have been quite a graybeard\r\nwhen he wrote on the astrolabe for the juvenile Henry Plantagenet. On\r\nthe whole, therefore, I am inclined to think that Henry I had been\r\nreigning for some time when Adelard wrote the _Natural Questions_.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[104] Haskins (1911) pp. 492-3.\r\n\r\n[105] It is true that after 1109, “The queen herself, who had for a\r\ntime accompanied the movements of her husband, now resided mostly\r\nat Westminster” (G. B. Adams in Hunt and Poole, _Political History\r\nof England_, II, 151), so that Adelard would not have had many\r\nopportunities to play before her in the English possessions across the\r\nchannel after that date.\r\n\r\n[106] _De eodem et diverso_, pp. 25-6, Philosophy addresses Adelard,\r\n“... cum praeterito anno in eadem musica Gallicis studiis totus sudares\r\nadessetque in serotino tempore magister artis una cum discipulis cum\r\neorum reginaeque rogatu citharam tangeres.”\r\n\r\n[107] P. 3, line 16, “Quoniam autem in epistola hac ...”; line 25,\r\n“Hanc autem epistolam ‘De eodem et diverso’ intitulavi”; p. 34, line 7,\r\n“Vale; et utrum recte disputaverim, tecum dijudica.”\r\n\r\n[108] P. 3, line 9, “Nam et ego, cum idem metuens iniustae cuidam\r\nnepotis mei accusationi rescribere vererer, in hanc demum sententiam\r\nanimum compuli, ut reprehensionis metum patienter ferrem, accusationi\r\niniustae pro posse meo responderem.”\r\n\r\nP. 4, line 6, “Saepenumero admirari soles, nepos, laboriosi itineris\r\nmei causam et aliquando acrius sub nomine levitatis et inconstantiae\r\npropositum accusare ...”; line 17, “Et ego, si tibi idem videtur,\r\ncausam erroris mei--ita enim vocare soles--paucis edisseram et\r\nmultiplicem labyrinthum ad unum honesti exitum vocabo ...”; line 22,\r\n“Ego rem, quam per biennium celavi, ut tibi morem geram aperiam....”\r\n\r\nP. 34, line 3, “Hactenus, carissime nepos, tibi causam itineris mei\r\nper diversarum regionum doctores flexi satagens explicavi, ut et me\r\ninjustae accusationis tuae onere alleviarem et tibi eorundem studiorum\r\naffectum applicarem....”\r\n\r\n[109] P. 33, line 13, “... a Salerno veniens in Graecia maiore ...”;\r\nalso p. 32, line 27, “Quod enim Gallica studia nesciunt, transalpina\r\nreserabunt; quod apud Latinos non addisces, Graecia facunda docebit.”\r\n\r\n[110] P. 4, line 25, “Erat praeterito in anno vir quidam apud Turonium\r\n... et te eius probitas non lateat, qui una ibi mecum adesses.”\r\n\r\n[111] _Quest. nat._, cap. 51, “Cum semel in partibus Antiochenis pontem\r\ncivitatis Manistre transires, ipsam pontem simul etiam totam ipsam\r\nregionem terre motu contremuisse.” It is true that this remark is\r\nput into the nephew’s mouth, but it is probably meant to refer to an\r\nincident of Adelard’s recent trip abroad and not to some previous one.\r\n\r\n[112] _Quest. nat._, _proemium_, “Meministi, nepos, septennio iam\r\ntransacto, cum te in gallicis studiis pene puerum iuxta laudisdunum\r\nuna cum ceteris auditoribus meis dimiserim, id inter nos convenisse ut\r\narabum studia pro posse meo scrutarer, te vero gallicarum sententiarum\r\nin constantiam non minus acquireres?\r\n\r\n(Nepos) Memini eo quoque magis quod tu discedens philosophie attentum\r\nfuturum me fidei promissione astringeres.”\r\n\r\n[113] _De eodem_, p. 4, line 10, “cum in pueritia adhuc detinearis.”\r\nIn this treatise, too, Adelard himself is regularly spoken of as\r\n_iuvenis_, which is, however, an exceedingly vague word.\r\n\r\n[114] “pene puerum.”\r\n\r\n[115] Latin MS 2389, a twelfth century parchment, of the Bibliothèque\r\nNationale, Paris.

Like Adelard also\r\nhe withdrew from the schools of Gaul after teaching there for a\r\ntime--longer apparently than Adelard; like Adelard he followed the\r\nguidance of reason and took an interest in natural science; like\r\nhim he employed the dramatic dialogue form in his works. John of\r\nSalisbury, who studied grammar under William of Conches and Richard\r\nBishop (_l’Évêque_) from about 1138 to 1141,[120] represents those\r\nmasters as successors to the thorough-going educational methods and\r\nhumanistic ideals of Bernard of Chartres; but adds that later, when\r\nmen “preferred to seem rather than be philosophers, and professors\r\nof the arts promised to transmit all philosophy to their hearers in\r\nless than three or two years’ time, overcome by the onslaught of the\r\nunskilled multitude, they ceased teaching.”[121] William then seems\r\nto have entered the service of Geoffrey Plantagenet, to whom as duke\r\nof Normandy as well as count of Anjou we find William addressing his\r\n_Dragmaticon_ or _Dramaticus_, which takes the form of a dialogue\r\nbetween them. It thus was written at some time between 1144 and 1150,\r\nthe period when Geoffrey was duke of Normandy.[122] His son, the\r\nfuture Henry II of England, was in Normandy from 1146 to 1149, when\r\nWilliam appears to have been his tutor.[123] In the _Dragmaticon_\r\nWilliam praises Geoffrey for training his children “from a tender age”\r\nin the study of literature,[124] and before the boy was made duke of\r\nNormandy by his father in 1150 at the age of seventeen William prepared\r\nfor his perusal a collection of moral extracts from such classical\r\nLatin authors as Cicero, Seneca, Juvenal, Horace, Lucan, and Persius,\r\nentitled _De honesto et utili_.[125] The last we hear of William seems\r\nto be in 1154, under which date Alberic des Trois Fontaines,[126] a\r\nthirteenth century chronicler, states that he had attained a great\r\nreputation. He might well have lived on for some time after that date,\r\nsince his former associate, Richard Bishop, was archdeacon of Coutances\r\nat the time John of Salisbury wrote the _Metalogicus_ in 1159, and\r\nsurvived to become bishop of Avranches in 1171, dying only in 1182. One\r\ninfers, however, from John’s account that William was no longer living\r\nin 1159.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Early life.]\r\n\r\nWe may next look back upon the earlier events of William’s life. In the\r\n_Dragmaticon_ he speaks of having been previously engaged in teaching\r\n“for twenty years and more than that.” Still earlier he had been a\r\nstudent, presumably under Bernard of Chartres, in which town it is\r\npossible that much of his own teaching was done. John of Salisbury,\r\nhowever, simply says of his studies with William, “Straightway I betook\r\nme to the grammarian of Conches,” while in another passage he mentions\r\n“my teachers in grammar, William of Conches and Richard, surnamed\r\nBishop, now an archdeacon at Coutances.” Although this passage might\r\nseem to suggest that William taught at Conches, no one so far as I know\r\nhas ever entertained that supposition, and the chief dispute has been\r\nwhether he taught at Chartres or at Paris.[127] But that he was born at\r\nConches no one doubts, and he himself once speaks somewhat satirically\r\nof his Norman dulness compared to the lightning intelligences of some\r\nof his contemporaries.[128]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Writings.]\r\n\r\nThe _Dragmaticon_ was a revision of a work on philosophy or natural\r\nphilosophy composed in William’s “younger days.”[129] He also appears\r\nto have commented upon Boethius’ _Consolation of Philosophy_,[130] and\r\nto have written a gloss on the _Timaeus_[131] in which among other\r\nthings he dilates upon the perfection of certain numbers. But our\r\ndiscussion will be almost exclusively concerned with his much more\r\ninfluential _Philosophia_ and its revised version, _Dragmaticon_. We\r\nshall first examine the original version.[132]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Philosophia_: general character.]\r\n\r\nThe original treatise touches on the fields of philosophy and astronomy\r\nin a simple and elementary way, but with considerable skill, if not\r\noriginality, in the selection and presentation of its subject-matter.\r\nWilliam does not seem acquainted with Arabic science except that he\r\nhas read Constantinus Africanus and from him derived the same doctrine\r\nthat the four elements are never found in a pure state which we met\r\nin Adelard of Bath. William gives us a Platonic interpretation of\r\nnature, in which nevertheless he does not adhere at all closely to the\r\n_Timaeus_, interspersed with not infrequent quotation from or reference\r\nto astronomical works, classical literature, and the Bible and church\r\nfathers. Indeed, he is always careful to allow for divine influence\r\nin nature and for the statements of Scripture, and to show that his\r\ntheories do not contradict either. In such passages his language is\r\nalways reverent, and he not infrequently alludes respectfully to what\r\nthe saints have to say (_sancti dicunt_) on the theme in hand. The body\r\nof the treatise opens with definition of philosophy and statement of\r\nits method of inquiry, after which the author argues that the world was\r\nmade by God and discusses the Trinity at some length. He then discusses\r\nthe topics of world-soul, demons, and elements; next passes to various\r\nmatters astronomical and astrological concerning the sky and stars; and\r\nfinally treats of our lower world and of man.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Contemporary education.]\r\n\r\nThe work also contains, especially in the prefaces to its different\r\nbooks but also in other passages, a number of interesting allusions\r\nto contemporary learning and education. William frequently refers to\r\nthe existence of other scholars and furthermore makes it evident that\r\nthis learned society is not in its earliest stage. Its paradise period\r\nis over; the evil has entered in among the good; the enemy has sown\r\ntares amid the wheat. Education has become too popular, and already\r\nthe insincere and the incapable, the charlatan and the unthinking\r\nmob, are cheapening and degrading the ideals of the true philosopher.\r\nWilliam speaks of “many who usurp the name of teacher,”[133] and of\r\n“certain men who have never read the works either of Constantinus\r\nor of any other philosopher, who out of pride disdain to learn from\r\nanyone, who from arrogance invent what they do not know,”[134] and who\r\nactually insist that the four qualities, hot, cold, moist, and dry,\r\nare elements. In another passage William says, “Although we are aware\r\nthat many strive for an ornate style, few for accuracy of statement,\r\nyet rejoicing not in the many but in the probity of the few, we toil\r\nfor truth alone.”[135] These are not all of William’s complaints.\r\nBack in the world of feudalism, crusades, and Holy Roman Empire which\r\nseems to many so foreign, distant, and incomprehensible, he voices\r\ngrievances which are still those of the college or university professor\r\nof to-day. The teacher is so occupied with classes that he has little\r\ntime for research and publication;[136] the vulgar crowd has stolen\r\nphilosophy’s clothing and left the essential body of truth naked and\r\nvainly crying for covering,--a figure borrowed from _The Consolation\r\nof Philosophy_ of Boethius without express acknowledgment,[137] but\r\nperhaps the allusion was so familiar as not to require one; the truly\r\nlearned are in danger of the bite of envy; most teachers are catering\r\nto their pupils and giving “snap courses” in order to gain popularity;\r\nthe elective system is a failure, since the students, in the words\r\nof the Apostle, “after their own lusts heap to themselves teachers\r\nhaving itching ears”; academic freedom has become a thing of the past\r\nnow that masters are become flatterers of their students and students\r\njudges of their masters, while “if there is anyone who does maintain\r\na magisterial air, he is shunned as if insane by the meretricious\r\nscholars and is called cruel and inhuman.”[138] All which agrees\r\nperfectly with John of Salisbury’s statement why William had ceased\r\nteaching.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Good and bad demons.]\r\n\r\nWilliam does not mention magic in his treatise, but the fact that he\r\ndoes not condemn all demons indifferently is perhaps worth noting as\r\na departure from the usual patristic view and as offering opportunity\r\nfor an innocent variety of necromancy. William, who attributes his\r\nclassification to Plato, distinguishes three sorts of demons. The first\r\nclass, existent in the ether betwixt firmament and moon, are rational,\r\nimmortal, ethereal animals, invisible and impassive, whose function is\r\nblissful contemplation of the divine sun. The second class, who dwell\r\nin the upper atmosphere near the moon, are rational, immortal, aerial\r\nanimals. They communicate the prayers of men to God and the will of\r\nGod to men, either in person or through signs or dreams and “by the\r\nclosest aspiration of vocal warning.” They are capable of feeling, and,\r\ndevoting themselves to good men, rejoice in their prosperity and suffer\r\nwith them in their adversity. Both of these first two classes of demons\r\nare good,--_kalodaemones_. But the third class, who inhabit the humid\r\natmosphere near the earth and are rational, immortal, watery animals,\r\nand capable of feeling, are in every way evil,--_kakodaemones_. They\r\nare lustful, cohabit with women, and envy and plot against mankind, for\r\nmen, although fallen from grace like these demons, can recover their\r\nlost estate as the demons cannot.[139]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Astronomy and astrology.]\r\n\r\nWilliam offers a rather novel and unusual explanation of the difference\r\nin meaning between the terms “astronomy” and “astrology,” stating that\r\nauthorities on the subject speak of the superior bodies in three ways,\r\nthe fabulous, the astrological, and the astronomical. The method by\r\nfable is that employed by Aratus, Memroth (Nimrod the astronomer?), and\r\nHyginus (“Eginus”), who interpret the Greek myths in an astronomical\r\nsense. Hipparchus and Martianus Capella are representatives of the\r\nastrological method, which treats of phenomena as they appear to exist\r\nin the heavens, whether they are really so or not. Astronomy, on the\r\ncontrary, deals with things as they are, whether they seem to be so or\r\nnot. Exactly what he has in mind by this distinction William fails to\r\nmake any clearer as he proceeds, but from the fact that he lists Julius\r\nFirmicus and Ptolemy as instances of the astronomical method it would\r\nappear that he included part at least of what we should call astrology\r\nunder “astronomy.” William cites yet other astronomical authorities,\r\nadvising anyone wishing to learn about the Milky Way to read Macrobius,\r\nand for an explanation of the signs of the zodiac to consult Helpericus\r\n(of Auxerre), the ninth century compiler of a _Computus_ which occurs\r\nwith fair frequency in the manuscripts.[140]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Extent of the influence of the stars.]\r\n\r\nWilliam represents “Plato, most learned of all philosophers,” as\r\nsaying that God the Creator entrusted the task of forming the\r\nhuman body to the stars and spirits which He had first created,\r\nbut reserved to Himself the making of the human soul.[141] This\r\nChristian interpretation or rather perversion of Plato’s doctrine\r\nin the _Timaeus_ is characteristic. William accepts to the full the\r\ncontrol of the stars over nature and the human body, but stops there.\r\nLike Adelard he states that the stars are composed of the same four\r\nelements as earthly objects. The predominance in their composition\r\nof the superior elements, fire and air, accounts for their motion.\r\nTheir motion heats the atmosphere which in turn heats the element\r\nwater, which is the fundamental constituent in the various species\r\nof animals, which further differ according to the admixture in them\r\nof the other elements. Of the superior elements the birds of the air\r\nhave the most, and fish next. Of land animals choleric ones, like the\r\nlion, possess most fire; phlegmatic ones, like pigs, most water; and\r\nmelancholic ones, like the cow and ass, most earth. The human body is\r\ncomposed of an unusual harmony of the four elements, to which Scripture\r\nalludes in saying that “God formed man of the dust of the earth.”[142]\r\nWilliam also lists the natural qualities and humors of each planet\r\nand its consequent influence for good or evil. He believes that the\r\nancient _astrologi_ discovered that Saturn is a cold star by repeatedly\r\nobserving that in those years when the Sun in Cancer burned the earth\r\nless than usual, Saturn was invariably in conjunction with it in the\r\nsame sign. How Saturn comes to exert this chilling influence William\r\nis less certain. He has already denied the existence of the congealed\r\nwaters above the firmament, so that he cannot accept the theory that\r\nSaturn is cold because of its proximity to them. He can only suggest\r\nthat its great distance from us perhaps explains why it heats less than\r\nthe other planets.[143] The good and evil influences of the planets\r\nalso come out in the astrological interpretation of myth and fable.\r\nThus Saturn is said to carry a scythe because one who carries a scythe\r\ndoes more execution in receding than in advancing. Jupiter is said in\r\nthe fables to have ousted his father Saturn because the approach of the\r\nplanet Jupiter increases the evil influence of Saturn. Jupiter is said\r\nto have begotten divers children in adultery because the conjunctions\r\nof that planet produce varied effects upon earth; and Venus is said to\r\nhave had adulterous intercourse with Mars because the propinquity of\r\nthe planet Venus to the planet Mars renders the former less benevolent.\r\nMars is god of battle because the planet of that name produces heat\r\nand drought which in their turn engender animosity.[144] As the tides\r\nfollow the phases of the moon, so, William believes, a universal flood\r\nor conflagration may be produced by the simultaneous elevation or\r\ndepression of all the planets.[145] But he accepts comets as special\r\nsigns of the future caused by the Creator’s will instead of attempting\r\nto give a natural explanation of the events which follow them.[146]\r\nThis is perhaps because of their signifying human events. Thunder and\r\nlightning are discussed without mention of divination from them.[147]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Science and religion.]\r\n\r\nThus far we have heard William cite authorities rather than spurn them\r\nas Adelard did. He could, however, be independent enough on occasion.\r\nHe went so far as to reject the Scriptural account of waters above the\r\nfirmament, if that word were taken in its ordinary astronomical sense,\r\nas naturally impossible; he explained away the passage in _Genesis_\r\nby interpreting the firmament to mean the air, and the waters above\r\nit, the clouds.[148] Like Adelard, too, he several times feels it\r\nessential to justify his views against the possible criticism of an\r\nobscurantist religious party. Discussing the Trinity, he insists that\r\nif anyone finds something in his book which is not found elsewhere,\r\nit should not on that account be stigmatized as heresy but only if it\r\ncan be shown to be against the Faith.[149] Thus he confirms Adelard’s\r\ncomplaint that the present generation is prejudiced against any modern\r\ndiscoveries. William, by the way, also employs the word “modern.”\r\nAgain, in affirming the physical impossibility of reconciling the\r\nelements fire and earth, he notes that someone may object that God\r\ncould find a way. To this he replies that “we do not place a limit upon\r\ndivine power, but we do say that of existing things none can do it, nor\r\nin the nature of things can there be anything that would suffice.”[150]\r\nIn a third passage his indignation is fanned to a white heat by those\r\nwho say, “We do not know how this is, but we know that God can do it.”\r\n“You poor fools,” he retorts, “God can make a cow out of a tree, but\r\nhas He ever done so? Therefore show some reason why a thing is so, or\r\ncease to hold that it is so.”[151] Elsewhere he yet further dilates\r\nupon the unreasonableness of the opponents of natural science, who are\r\nloath to have explained even the natural facts given in the Bible but\r\nprefer to accept them blindly, and who, “since they themselves are\r\nunacquainted with the forces of nature, in order that they may have all\r\nmen as companions in their ignorance, wish them to investigate nothing\r\nbut to believe like rustics. We, on the contrary,” continues William,\r\n“think that a reason should be sought in every case, if one can be\r\nfound.”[152] Thus he vigorously echoes Adelard’s exhortation to give\r\nand take reason, and his retort to the nephew’s suggestion that the\r\ngrowth of plants from earth can be explained only as a divine miracle.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Letter of William of St. Thierry to St. Bernard.]\r\n\r\nWilliam, it turned out, was too original and bold in some of his\r\nassertions concerning the Trinity and kindred topics, which were\r\nnot allowed to pass unchallenged. A letter to St. Bernard from\r\nWilliam, abbot of St. Thierry,[153] shows the attitude of William\r\nof Conches’ opponents. The abbot first says,--with the assumption\r\nof superior seriousness and dignity characteristic through all time\r\nof conservatives, bigots, and pompous persons subconsciously aware\r\nof their own stupidity--that anyone who knows William of Conches\r\npersonally is aware of his levity and will not take his vanities\r\ntoo seriously, and that he is to be classed with Abelard in the\r\npresumptuousness of his opinions. The abbot then devotes most of his\r\nletter to an attack upon William’s discussion of the Trinity, taking\r\numbrage at his discussing questions of faith at all, especially upon a\r\nphilosophical basis, and at his distribution of the three faculties,\r\npower, will, and wisdom, among the Three Persons. The abbot more\r\nbriefly objects to William’s physical account of the creation of man,\r\nsaying: “First he says that man’s body was not made by God but by\r\nnature, and the soul was given him by God afterwards, and forsooth that\r\nthe body was made by spirits whom he calls demons and by the stars.”\r\nThis doctrine the abbot regards as on the one hand dangerously close\r\nto the opinion “of certain stupid philosophers who say that there is\r\nnothing but matter and the material, and that there is no other God in\r\nthe world than the concourse of the elements and the system of nature”;\r\nand on the other hand as manifestly Manichean, affirming that the human\r\nsoul is created by a good God but the body by the prince of darkness.\r\nFinally the abbot complains that William “stupidly and haughtily\r\nridicules history of divine authority,” and “interprets in a physical\r\nsense” the account of the creation of woman from one of Adam’s ribs.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Extent of William’s retraction in the _Dragmaticon_.]\r\n\r\nThe effect of this theological attack upon William of Conches can\r\nprobably be discerned in the _Dragmaticon_. There he states that it is\r\nhis purpose to include “many essential points” which were not contained\r\nin the earlier treatise, and to omit those statements which he has\r\nsince become convinced are erroneous. He then proceeds to list and\r\nexpressly condemn certain statements in the earlier work as contrary\r\nto the Catholic Faith, and he asks those readers who have copies of\r\nthat treatise to make these corrections in it.[154] He accordingly\r\nretracts his assertion that in the Trinity the Father represents power\r\nand the Holy Spirit will, since there is no direct scriptural authority\r\nfor this view, but he still maintains that the Son is Wisdom on the\r\nauthority of the Apostle. He takes back his interpretation of the words\r\nof the Prophet concerning Christ, “Who will tell his generation?” as\r\nindicating merely the difficulty and not the impossibility of solving\r\nthat mystery. Finally he reverts to the letter of Scripture in regard\r\nto the creation of Eve.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Reassertion of previous views.]\r\n\r\nBut this done, William becomes his old self again in the remainder of\r\nthe _Dragmaticon_. In the rôle of the philosopher he argues at length\r\nwith the duke whether Plato’s five circles of the sky and division of\r\nspirits into _kalodaemones_ and _kakodaemones_ is in agreement with\r\nthe Christian Faith. Later on, when the duke cites Bede against him in\r\nregard to some astronomical point, he replies that in a pure matter of\r\nfaith he would feel obliged to accept Bede’s authority, but that on a\r\npoint of philosophy he feels perfectly at liberty to disagree with him.\r\nThis declaration of scientific independence from patristic authority\r\nbecame a _locus classicus_ cited with approval by several writers of\r\nthe next century. Presently to our surprise we find William boldly\r\ninquiring at what time of year the six days of creation occurred. He\r\nalso indulges as before in somewhat bitter reflections upon the learned\r\nworld of his day.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: No denial of science.]\r\n\r\nWilliam, therefore, has had to withdraw some theological opinions for\r\nwhich he could not show authority in Scripture, and some other opinions\r\nwherein he disregarded the literal meaning of the Bible. But except\r\nthat he has to agree to the miraculous account of the creation of the\r\nfirst woman, he does not seem to have altered his views concerning\r\nnature and philosophy, nor to have given up in any way his scientific\r\nattitude or his astrological theories. The theologians have forced him\r\nto conform in respect to theology, but his retraction in that field\r\ntakes the form of a second edition of his treatise and a reaffirmation\r\nof his astronomical and philosophical views. As Hauréau well says, “He\r\nalways believes in science, he still defends in the name of science, in\r\nthe accents, and by the method of the scholar, everything in his former\r\nwritings that has not been condemned in the name of the Faith.... So it\r\nis no denial of philosophy that has been won by the outcries of William\r\nof St. Thierry and Walter of St. Victor;[155] those attacks have\r\nresulted in merely intimidating the theologian.”[156]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: William’s future influence.]\r\n\r\nSuch attacks, moreover, had little or no success in lessening William’s\r\nultimate future influence. How utterly they failed to intimidate\r\nastrologers may be inferred from the much greater lengths to which\r\nWilliam’s contemporary, Bernard Silvester, went without apparently\r\ngetting into any trouble, and from the half-hearted arguments against\r\nthe art of John of Salisbury a little later in the century. As Doctor\r\nPoole has already pointed out, even the _Philosophia_, which William\r\nof St. Thierry censured and which William of Conches himself modified,\r\nsurvived in its original and unexpurgated version “to be printed in\r\nthree several editions as the production of the venerable Bede, of\r\nsaint Anselm’s friend, William of Hirschau, and of Honorius of Autun;\r\nthe taint of heresy plainly cannot have been long perceptible to\r\nmedieval librarians.”[157] Also the revised edition, or _Dragmaticon_,\r\n“enjoyed a remarkable popularity, and a wide diffusion attested by a\r\nmultitude of manuscripts at Vienna, Munich, Paris, Oxford, and other\r\nplaces.”[158] We shall find William’s book much used and cited by\r\nthe learned writers of the following century, and a number of copies\r\nof it are listed in the fifteenth century catalogue of the library\r\nof St. Augustine’s Abbey, Canterbury. If then from the contemporary\r\nand passing world of talk William retired disgusted and discomfited\r\nto the shelter of ducal patronage, in the enduring world of thought\r\nand letters he carved for himself a lasting niche by his comparative\r\nintellectual courage, originality, and thoroughness.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[119] On William of Conches see, besides HL XXI, 455 _et seq._ and DNB,\r\nAntoine Charma, _Guillaume de Conches_, Paris, 1857; B.

The two\r\nworks may perhaps be most readily distinguished by their _Incipits_,\r\nwhich are, for _Philosophia_, “Quoniam ut ait Tullius in prologo\r\nrhetoricorum, Eloquentia sine sapientia ...”, and for _Dragmaticon_,\r\n“Quaeris, venerande dux Normannorum et comes Andagavensium, cur\r\nmagistris nostri temporis minus creditur quam antiquis....” The titles\r\nand the number of books into which the work is divided differ a good\r\ndeal in different editions and manuscripts, and the catalogues of\r\nmanuscript collections sometimes do not identify the author.\r\n\r\nFirst as to printed editions. _Philosophia_ has been printed three\r\ntimes as the work of three other authors.\r\n\r\n Philosophicarum et astronomicarum institutionum Guilelmi\r\n   Hirsaugiensis olim abbatis libri tres, Basel, 1531.\r\n\r\n Bede, Opera, 1563, II, 311-43, Περὶ Διδάξων, sive\r\n   Elementorum Philosophiae Libri IV.\r\n\r\n Honorius of Autun, De philosophia mundi, Migne, PL vol. 172.\r\n\r\n_Dragmaticon_ seems to be have been printed but once under the title,\r\n\r\n Dialogus de substantiis physicis confectus a Guillelmo\r\n   aneponymo philosopho, Strasburg, 1567.\r\n\r\nIn the following list of MSS, which is no doubt far from complete,\r\nI have attempted to distinguish between the _Philosophia_ and\r\n_Dragmaticon_ but have often had to rely only upon the notices in\r\ncatalogues which frequently do not give the opening words or other\r\ndistinguishing marks.

Some medieval Johns, mentioned\r\n in the manuscripts, in the fields of natural and occult\r\n science, mathematics and medicine.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Importance of medieval translations.]\r\n\r\nAlready we have treated of a number of Arabic works of occult\r\nscience which are extant in Latin translations, or have mentioned\r\nmen, important in the history of medieval science like Constantinus\r\nAfricanus or Adelard of Bath, whose works were either largely or partly\r\ntranslations. In future chapters we shall have occasion to mention\r\nother men and works of the same sort. We have already seen, too, that\r\ntranslations from the Greek were being made all through the early\r\nmiddle ages and in the tenth century; and we shall see this continue\r\nin the twelfth and thirteenth centuries especially in connection with\r\nGalen, Aristotle, and Ptolemy. We have also seen reasons for suspecting\r\nthat the Latin versions of certain works were older than the so-called\r\nGreek originals, that works were sometimes translated from Arabic into\r\nGreek as well as from Greek into Arabic, and that there probably never\r\nwere any Arabic originals for some so-called translations from the\r\nArabic which are extant only in Latin. All this is not yet to mention\r\nversions from Hebrew and Syriac or in French, Spanish, and Anglo-Saxon.\r\nWe have seen also in general how important and influential in the\r\nhistory of medieval learning was the work of the translator, and yet\r\nhow complicated and difficult to follow. Many names of translators are\r\nmentioned in the medieval manuscripts: some, for instance, who will not\r\nbe treated of in the present chapter are: from the Greek, Aristippus\r\nof Sicily, Bartholomew of Messina, Burgundio of Pisa, Eugenius admiral\r\nof Sicily, Grumerus of Piacenza, Nicolaus of Reggio, Stephen of\r\nMessina, and William of Moerbeke; from the Arabic, Egidius de Tebaldis\r\nof Parma, Arnold of Barcelona, Blasius Armegandus or Ermengardus of\r\nMontpellier, Marcus of Toledo, the canon Salio of Padua, John Lodoycus\r\nTetrapharmacus, Philip of Spain, Philip of Tripoli, Roger of Parma,\r\nFerragius, and so on. But not all such names of translators can be\r\ncorrectly placed and dated, and many translations remain anonymous in\r\nthe manuscripts. Into this vast and difficult field Jourdain’s work on\r\nthe medieval translations of Aristotle made but an entrance, and that\r\none which now needs amendment, and even such extensive bibliographical\r\ninvestigations as those of Steinschneider have only made rough charts\r\nof portions. Some detailed monographs on single translators[159] and\r\nthe like topics have been written, but many more will be required\r\nbefore we shall have a satisfactory general orientation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Plan of this chapter.]\r\n\r\nThe subject of medieval translations as a whole of course in any case\r\nlies in large part beyond the scope of our investigation and would lead\r\nus into other literary and learned fields not bearing upon experimental\r\nscience and magic. In the present chapter we shall further limit\r\nourselves to some translators of the twelfth century who chiefly\r\ntranslated works of astrology from the Arabic and who, although they\r\nthemselves often came from other lands, were especially active in\r\nSpain. One or two men will be introduced who do not possess all these\r\nqualifications, but who are related to the other men and works included\r\nin the chapter.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Transmission of Arabic astrology.]\r\n\r\nThroughout the twelfth century from its first years to its close may\r\nbe traced the transit of learning from the Arabic world, and more\r\nparticularly from the Spanish peninsula, to northwestern Europe.\r\nThree points may be made concerning this transmission: it involves\r\nLatin translation from the Arabic; the matter translated is largely\r\nmathematical, or more especially astronomical and astrological in\r\ncharacter; finally, it is often experimental.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Walcher, prior of Malvern.]\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the very threshold of the twelfth century, in addition to Adelard\r\nof Bath to whom we have given a separate chapter, we meet with another\r\nEnglishman, Walcher, prior of Malvern, whom we find associated with\r\nPeter Alphonso or Pedro Alfonso, who apparently was a converted Spanish\r\nJew. Walcher’s experimental observations would seem to have antedated\r\nhis association with Pedro, since a chapter headed, “Of the writer’s\r\nexperience,”[160] in lunar tables which he composed between 1107 and\r\n1112, tells of an eclipse which he saw in Italy in 1091 but could\r\nnot observe exactly because he had no clock (_horologium_) at hand\r\nto measure the time, and of another in the succeeding year after his\r\nreturn to England which he was able to observe more scientifically with\r\nthe aid of an astrolabe. In 1120 Walcher translated into Latin, at\r\nleast according to the testimony of the manuscripts, an astronomical\r\nwork by Pedro Alfonso on the Dragon.[161] Pedro perhaps wrote the\r\noriginal in Hebrew or Spanish or translated it from the Arabic into\r\none of those languages, but we also know of his writing in Latin\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Pedro Alfonso.]\r\n\r\nThis Pedro Alfonso seems to have been the same[162] who in 1106\r\nin his forty-fourth year was baptized at Huesca with the name\r\nof his godfather, King Alfonso I of Aragon, and who wrote the\r\n_Disciplina clericalis_ and _Dialogi cum Iudeo_. Indeed we find the\r\n_Disciplina clericalis_ and _De dracone_ ascribed to him in the same\r\nmanuscript.[163] In another manuscript chronological and astronomical\r\ntables are found under his name and the accompanying explanatory text\r\nopens, “Said Pedro Alfonso, servant of Jesus Christ and translator\r\nof this book.”[164] This expression is very similar, as Haskins\r\nhas pointed out, to a heading in a manuscript of the _Disciplina\r\nclericalis_, “Said Pedro Alfonso, servant of Christ Jesus, physician\r\nof Henry the first (_sic_) king of the Angles, composer of this\r\nbook.”[165] The experimental pretensions and astrological leanings of\r\nthe astronomical treatise are suggested by Pedro’s statement that the\r\nscience of the stars divides into three parts, marvelous in reasoning,\r\nnotable in the signification of events, and approved in experience; and\r\nthat the third part is the science of the nature of the spheres and\r\nstars, and their significations in earthly affairs which happen from\r\nthe virtue of their nature and the diversity of their movements, things\r\nknown by experiment.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: His letter to the Peripatetics.]\r\n\r\nIn a manuscript at the British Museum[166] I have read what seems to\r\nbe a third astronomical treatise by Pedro Alfonso, differing both\r\nfrom the preceding and from the _De dracone_.[167] We meet as before\r\nthe expression, “Said Alfonso, servant of Jesus Christ and translator\r\nof this book,”[168] and the emphasis upon experiment and astrology\r\ncontinues. It will be noted further that in this treatise, which takes\r\nthe form of a letter to Peripatetics and those nourished by the milk of\r\nphilosophy everywhere through France, Pedro is no longer connected with\r\nEnglishmen, although this manuscript, too, is in an English library.\r\nAfter rehearsing the utility of grammar, dialectic, and arithmetic,\r\nPedro finally comes to astronomy, an art with which “all of the Latins\r\ngenerally” are little acquainted, in which he himself has long been\r\noccupied, and a portion of which he presents to them as something rare\r\nand precious. It has come to his ears that some seekers after wisdom\r\nare preparing to traverse distant provinces and penetrate to remote\r\nregions in order to acquire fuller astronomical knowledge, and he\r\nproposes to save them from this inconvenience by bringing astronomy\r\nto them. Apparently, therefore, this letter to the Peripatetics and\r\nother students of philosophy is simply the advertisement of, or preface\r\nto, a translation by Pedro of some astronomical or astrological work,\r\npresumably from the Arabic.[169] It is accordingly mainly devoted to a\r\njustification of the thorough study of astronomy and astrology. Many\r\npersons, in Pedro’s opinion, are simply too lazy to take the trouble\r\nto ground themselves properly therein. Those who think they know all\r\nabout the subject because they have read Macrobius and a few other\r\nauthors are found wanting in a crisis,--a passage meant doubtless as a\r\nhit at those who base their knowledge of astronomy simply upon Latin\r\nauthors. Pedro also alludes to those who have been accustomed to regard\r\nthemselves as teachers of astronomy and now hate to turn pupils again.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Experimental method.]\r\n\r\nThe contrast which Pedro draws, however, is not so much between Latin\r\nand Arabic writings as it is between dependence upon a few past\r\nauthorities and adoption of the experimental method. He argues that\r\nthe principles of astronomy were discovered in the first place only\r\nthrough experimentation, and that today no one can understand the art\r\nfundamentally without actual observation and experience. He believes\r\nthat astrology as well as astronomy is proved by experience. “It has\r\nbeen proved therefore by experimental argument that we can truly affirm\r\nthat the sun and moon and other planets exert their influences in\r\nearthly affairs.”[170] Or, as he says in another passage, “And indeed\r\nmany other innumerable things happen on earth in accordance with the\r\ncourses of the stars, and pass unnoticed by the senses of most men, but\r\nare discovered and understood by the subtle acumen of learned men who\r\nare skilled in this art.”[171] Pedro’s letter further includes some\r\nastrological medicine, interesting in connection with the statement in\r\nanother manuscript that he was the physician of Henry I of England. In\r\nthis context, too, he shows familiarity with the translations from the\r\nArabic of Constantinus Africanus.[172]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Magic and scepticism in the _Disciplina clericalis_.]\r\n\r\nPedro’s _Disciplina clericalis_,[173] although a collection of\r\noriental tales rather than a work of natural science,[174] contains\r\none or two passages of interest to us. Asked by a disciple what the\r\nseven arts are, the master gives a list somewhat different from the\r\ncommon Latin _trivium_ and _quadrivium_, namely, logic, arithmetic,\r\ngeometry, physics, music, and astronomy. As to the seventh there is\r\nsome dispute, he says. Philosophers who believe in divination make\r\nnecromancy the seventh; other philosophers who do not believe in\r\npredictions substitute philosophy; while persons who are ignorant of\r\nphilosophy affirm that grammar is one of the seven arts.[175] Thus\r\nwhile Pedro retains all four arts of the _quadrivium_, he holds only\r\nto logic in the case of the _trivium_, omitting rhetoric entirely\r\nand tending to substitute physics and necromancy for it and grammar.\r\nThis tendency away from _belles-lettres_ to a curriculum made up\r\nof logic and philosophy, mathematical and natural science, also\r\nsoon became characteristic of Latin learning, while the tendency to\r\ninclude necromancy as one of the liberal arts or natural sciences,\r\nalthough less successful, will be found in other writers who are to\r\nbe considered in this chapter. In the passage just discussed the\r\nimportance of the number seven also receives emphasis, as the master\r\ngoes on to speak of other sevens than the arts. One is impressed also\r\nin reading the _Disciplina clericalis_ by a sceptical note concerning\r\nmagic and the marvelous properties of natural objects, as in the tale\r\nof the thief who repeated a charm seven times and tried to take hold of\r\na moonbeam, but as a result fell and was captured, and in the tale of\r\nthe Churl and the Bird, who promised his captor, if released, to reveal\r\nthree pieces of wisdom.[176] The first was not to believe everyone.\r\n“This saide,” in the quaint wording of the medieval English version,\r\n“the litel brid ascendid vpon the tree and with a sweete voice bigan to\r\nsynge: ‘Blessid be god that hath shit and closed the sight of thyn eyen\r\nand taken awey thi wisdam, forwhi if thow haddest sought in the plites\r\nof myn entrailes thow shuldest have founde a jacinct the weight of an\r\nvnce.’” When the churl wept and beat his breast at this announcement of\r\nhis lost opportunity, the bird again warned him not to be so credulous.\r\n“And how belivistow that in me shuld be a jacynt the weight of an vnce,\r\nwhan I and al my body is nat of somoche weight?”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: John of Seville.]\r\n\r\nApparently the chief and most voluminous translator of astrological\r\nworks from Arabic into Latin in the twelfth century was John of\r\nSeville.[177] Although he translated some other mathematical, medical,\r\nand philosophical treatises, the majority of his translations seem\r\nto have been astrological, and they remained in use during the later\r\nmiddle ages and many of them appeared in print in early editions. So\r\nmany Johns[178] are mentioned in medieval manuscripts and even wrote\r\nin almost the same fields as John of Seville that it is not easy to\r\ndistinguish his works. Jourdain identified him with a John Avendeath\r\nor Avendehut (Joannes ibn David) who worked with the archdeacon\r\nGundissalinus under the patronage of Raymond, archbishop of Toledo from\r\n1126 to 1151.[179] John of Seville was perhaps not the man who worked\r\nwith Gundissalinus[180] but he certainly appears to have addressed\r\ntranslations to Archbishop Raymond. Thus in speaking of Costa ben\r\nLuca’s _De differentia spiritus et animae_ we saw that the manuscripts\r\nstated that it was translated by John of Seville from Arabic into Latin\r\nfor Archbishop Raymond of Toledo.[181] John of Seville is further\r\nstyled of Luna or Limia, in one manuscript as bishop of Luna,[182] and\r\nalso seems to be the same person as John of Toledo or of Spain. In\r\none of the citations of the _Speculum astronomiae_ of Albertus Magnus\r\nhe is called “Joannes Ulgembus Hispalensis.”[183] John Paulinus, who\r\ntranslated a collection of twelve experiments with snakeskin entitled\r\n_Life-saver_ which he discovered when he “was in Alexandria, a city\r\nof the Egyptians,” is in at least one manuscript of his translation\r\nidentified with John of Spain.[184]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Dates in his career.]\r\n\r\nCertain dates in the career of John of Seville may be regarded as\r\nfairly well fixed. In the Arabic year 529, or 1135 A. D., he translated\r\nthe _Rudiments of Astronomy_ of Alfraganus (Ahmed b. Muh. b. Ketîr\r\nel-Fargânî, or Al-Fargani)[185]; in 1142 A. D. he compiled his own\r\n_Epitome of the Art of Astrology_ or _Quadripartite Work of Judgments\r\nof the Stars_,[186] consisting of _Isagoge in astrologiam_ and four\r\nbooks of judgments. In 1153 A. D. he translated the _Nativities_ of\r\nAlbohali[187] (Yahyâ b. Gâlib, Abû Alî el-Chaiyât), if we accept the\r\n“John of Toledo” who is said to have translated that treatise as the\r\nsame person as our John of Spain.[188] John of Spain is sometimes said\r\nto have died in 1157, but Förster argued that the Tarasia, queen of\r\nSpain, to whom the medical portion of the pseudo-Aristotelian _Secret\r\nof Secrets_, translated by John of Spain, was dedicated, was not the\r\nqueen of Portugal contemporary with Archbishop Raymond of Toledo, but\r\nqueen of Leon from 1176 to 1180; and in 1175 a monk of Mt. Tabor is\r\ncalled Johannes Hispanus.[189] If a Vienna manuscript is correct in\r\nsaying that a marvelous cure for a sore heel which it contains was sent\r\nto Pope Gregory by John of Spain, the pope meant must be Gregory VIII\r\n(1187).[190] There is of course no impossibility in the supposition\r\nthat the literary career of John of Spain extended from the days of\r\nArchbishop Raymond to those of Gregory VIII or Queen Tarasia. Still\r\nthere is some doubt whether all the works extant under the name John of\r\nSpain were composed by the same individual.[191]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Further works by him, chiefly astrological.]\r\n\r\nSeveral books dealing with the science of judgments from the stars\r\nby John of Spain are included in the bibliography of deserving works\r\nof astrology in the _Speculum Astronomiae_ of Albertus Magnus, but\r\nare perhaps simply sections of his _Epitome_[192] which, after\r\ndiscussing in the _Isagoge_ the natures of the signs and planets,\r\ntakes up in turn the four main divisions of judicial astrology,\r\nnamely; conjunctions and revolutions, nativities, interrogations, and\r\nelections. John seems to have translated several astrological treatises\r\nby Albumasar and Messahala (Mâ-sâ-allâh), the treatise by Thebit\r\nben Corat on astrological images of which we have already treated,\r\nthat by Abenragel (ʿAli b. abî’l-Rigâl, abû’l-Hasan) on elections,\r\nand the _Introduction to the Mystery of Judgments from the Stars_ by\r\nAlchabitius or Alcabitius[193] (ʿAbdelʿazîz b. ʿOtmân el-Qabîsî), which\r\nshould not be confused with his own somewhat similar _Ysagoge_. Of\r\nother translations by John of Spain, such as a portion of the _Secret\r\nof Secrets_ of the Pseudo-Aristotle, the twelve experiments with\r\npulverized snakeskin, and Costa ben Luca’s _De differentia spiritus\r\net animae_, we treat elsewhere. He was perhaps also the author of a\r\nchiromancy.[194]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: John’s experimental astrology.]\r\n\r\nThe experimental character of John’s own handbook on astrology is\r\nworth noting. In the main, it is true, he follows the works of the\r\nphilosophers and astrologers of the past, especially when he finds them\r\nin agreement.[195] Besides constantly alluding to what astrologers\r\nin general or the ancients say on the point in question, he often\r\ncites of the Greeks Ptolemy and Dorotheus (“Dorothius”) and Hermes\r\nand Doronius, but probably through Arabic mediums. He also gives us\r\nthe views of the masters of India, and distinguishes as “more recent\r\nmasters of this art”[196] the Arabic writers “Alchindus” and Messahala.\r\nThe latter he seems to regard as an Indian or at least as skilful in\r\ntheir methods of judgment.[197] But he also notes when his authorities\r\nare in disagreement[198] or points out that his own experience in many\r\nnativities contradicts their views,[199] against which John’s readers\r\nare warned when they find them in the books of judgments. Even Ptolemy\r\nis twice criticized on the basis of actual experiment.[200] We see\r\nthat John was not merely a translator or writer on astrology but an\r\nexpert practitioner of the art. He supplements the divergent views of\r\npast authorities, or qualifies their consensus of opinion, by his own\r\napparently rich experience as a practicing or experimental astrologer.\r\nIndeed, for him the theory and practice of the art, the paths of reason\r\nand experience, are so united that he not merely speaks of “this\r\nreasoning” or view as being “tested by experience,”[201] but seems to\r\nemploy the words _ratio_ and _experimentum_ somewhat indiscriminately\r\nfor astrological tenet or technique.[202]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Gundissalinus _De divisione philosophiae_.]\r\n\r\nThe chief known work of Gundissalinus, the archdeacon who was for a\r\ntime perhaps associated with John of Spain in the labor of translation,\r\nis his _De divisione philosophiae_,[203] a treatise which owes much\r\nto the Turkoman Al-Farabi (Muh. b. Muh. b. Tarchân b. Uzlag, Abû Nasr,\r\nel-Fârâbî). If Baur is right in thinking that Gundissalinus made use\r\nof translations by Gerard of Cremona, 1114-1187, in the _De divisione\r\nphilosophiae_,[204] it would appear to be a later work than his\r\ntranslating for Archbishop Raymond, 1130-1150, which perhaps began as\r\nearly as 1133.[205]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Place of magic in the classification of the sciences.]\r\n\r\nIn the classification and description of the sciences which make up the\r\nbulk of the _De divisione philosophiae_ Gundissalinus gives a certain\r\nplace to the occult arts. At the beginning of the book, it is true, the\r\nmagic arts are not classed among useful things of the spirit like the\r\nvirtues and true sciences (_honestae scientiae_). Neither, however,\r\nare they grouped with pride, avarice, and vain glory as harmful vices,\r\nbut are merely classed along with worldly honors as vanities.[206]\r\n“Nigromancy according to physics,” however, is later listed as one of\r\neight sub-divisions of natural science together with alchemy, medicine,\r\nagriculture, navigation, the science of mirrors, and the sciences of\r\nimages and of judgments.[207] Gundissalinus was innocent, however, of\r\nany detailed knowledge of necromancy or indeed of any of the other\r\nsub-divisions except medicine. He explains that he has not yet advanced\r\nas far as these subjects in his studies.[208] He is manifestly simply\r\ncopying an Arabic classification, probably from Al-Farabi’s _De ortu\r\nscientiarum_, and one of which we find similar traces in other medieval\r\nChristian authors.[209]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Al-Farabi _De ortu scientiarum_.]\r\n\r\nThis little treatise on _The Rise of the Sciences_ by Al-Farabi,\r\nalthough it occupies only a leaf or two in the manuscripts and has\r\nonly recently been printed,[210] is a rather important one to note,\r\nas other of its statements than its eight sub-divisions of natural\r\nscience seem to be paralleled in medieval Latin writers. There seems,\r\nfor instance, a resemblance between its attitude towards the sciences\r\nand classification of them and that of Roger Bacon in the _Opus\r\nMaius_.[211] Al-Farabi believes in God the Creator, as his opening\r\nwords show, and he regards “divine science” as the end and perfection\r\nof the other sciences; “and beyond it investigation does not go, for\r\nit is itself the goal to which all inquiry tends.”[212] At the same\r\ntime Al-Farabi emphasizes the importance of natural science, adding\r\nits eight parts to the four divisions of the _quadrivium_--arithmetic,\r\ngeometry, astrology, and music, and saying, “Moreover, this last (i.\r\ne. natural) science is greater and broader than any of those sciences\r\nand disciplines (or, than any of those disciplinary sciences).” We need\r\na science, he says in effect, which deals inclusively with changes\r\nin nature, showing how they are brought about and their causes and\r\nenabling us to repel their harmful action when we wish or to augment\r\nthem,--a science of action and passion.[213] This suggestion of applied\r\nscience and of a connection between it and magic also reminds one of\r\nRoger Bacon, as does Al-Farabi’s statement later that the beginning of\r\nall sciences is the science of language.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Gundissalinus on astrology.]\r\n\r\nBoth for Al-Farabi and Gundissalinus the sciences of images and\r\njudgments were undoubtedly astrological. Gundissalinus himself believes\r\nthat the spiritual virtue of the celestial bodies is the efficient\r\ncause, ordained by the Creator, of generation, corruption, and other\r\nnatural operations in this corporeal world. He defines _astrologia_\r\nas we would astronomy, while he explains that _astronomia_ is the\r\nscience of answering questions from the position of the planets and\r\nsigns. There are many such sciences,--geomancy, hydromancy, aeromancy,\r\npyromancy, chiromancy, and augury; but astronomy is superior to\r\nthe rest because it predicts what will befall upon earth from the\r\ndispositions of the heavenly bodies. Gundissalinus also repeats\r\nIsidore’s distinction between _astronomia_ and _astrologia_, and\r\nbetween the natural and superstitious varieties of “astronomy.”[214]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Robert Kilwardby, _De ortu sive divisione scientiarum_.]\r\n\r\nAt this point it may be well to note briefly a later work with a\r\nvery similar title to that of Gundissalinus, namely, the _De ortu\r\nsive divisione scientiarum_ of Robert Kilwardby,[215] archbishop\r\nof Canterbury from 1272 to 1279. The work borrows a great deal from\r\nIsidore, Hugh of St. Victor, and Gundissalinus. One of its more\r\noriginal passages is that in which Kilwardby suggests an alteration\r\nin Hugh’s division of the mechanical arts, omitting theatrical\r\nperformances as more suited to Gentiles than Catholics, and arranging\r\nthe mechanical arts in a _trivium_ consisting of earth-culture,\r\nfood-science, and medicine, and a _quadrivium_ made up of costuming,\r\narmor-making, architecture, and business-courses (_mercatura_), after\r\nthe analogy of the seven liberal arts.[216] Kilwardby, as has been\r\nalready noted elsewhere, repeats Hugh’s classification of the magic\r\narts.[217]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Plato of Tivoli.]\r\n\r\nNext in importance to John of Spain as a translator of Arabic astrology\r\nin the first half of the twelfth century should probably be ranked\r\nPlato of Tivoli. They seem to have worked independently and sometimes\r\nto have made distinct translations of the same work, as in the case\r\nof the _Nativities_ of Albohali and the _Epistle_ of Messahala.\r\nOn the whole, Plato’s translations[218] would appear slightly to\r\nantedate John’s. Haskins has shown, however, that the date 1116,\r\nhitherto assigned for Plato’s translation of the _Liber embadorum_ of\r\nSavasorda, should be 1145.[219] But Plato’s translation of Albohali\r\nis dated 1136, while John’s was not made until 1153.[220] In 1136 is\r\nalso dated Plato’s translation of the astrological work of Almansor in\r\nthe form of one hundred and fifty or so brief aphorisms, judgments,\r\npropositions, or _capitula_, which later appeared repeatedly in print.\r\nTwo years later he turned the famous _Quadripartitum_ of Ptolemy into\r\nLatin. His other translations include Albucasis (Abû’l-Qâsim Chalaf b.\r\nʿAbbâs el-Zahrâwî) on the astrolabe, Haly (ʿAlî b. Ridwân b. ʿAlî b.\r\nĞaʿfar, Abû’l-Hasan) on nativities, and a geomancy. Most of Plato’s\r\ntranslations were produced at Barcelona.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Robert of Chester.]\r\n\r\nIn a manuscript at the British Museum[221] one of Plato of Tivoli’s\r\ntranslations is immediately preceded in the same large clear hand,\r\ndifferent from the smaller and later writing employed in the remainder\r\nof the manuscript, by a translation of the _Judgments_ of the\r\nastrologer Alkindi by Robert of Chester,[222] with an introduction\r\nto “my Hermann,” whom Robert commends highly as an astronomer. A\r\nletter written in 1143 by Peter the Venerable to St. Bernard tells\r\nhow in 1141 he had induced two “acute and well trained scholars,” who\r\nwere then residing in Spain near the river Ebro, to turn for a time\r\nfrom the arts of astrology which they had been studying there, and\r\nto translate the Koran. These two translators were the friends whom\r\nwe have just mentioned, Hermann of Dalmatia and Robert of Chester.\r\nRobert, too, tells us in the prefatory letter to the translation of the\r\nKoran, completed in 1143, that this piece of work was “a digression\r\nfrom his principal studies of astronomy and geometry.” Besides such\r\nmathematical treatises as his translations of the _Judicia_ of Alkindi,\r\nthe Algebra of Al-Khowarizmi, a treatise on the astrolabe ascribed to\r\nPtolemy, and several sets of astronomical tables, including a revision\r\nor rearrangement of Adelard of Bath’s translation of the Tables of\r\nAl-Khowarizmi, Robert on February 11, 1144, translated a treatise on\r\nalchemy which Morienus Romanus, a monk of Jerusalem, was supposed to\r\nhave written for “Calid, king of Egypt,” or Prince Khalid ibn Jazid,\r\na Mohammedan pretender and patron of learning at Alexandria. Of it we\r\nshall treat more fully in another chapter. About 1150 we seem to find\r\nRobert returned to his native England and writing at London.[223]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Hermann the Dalmatian.]\r\n\r\nHermann the Dalmatian, or twelfth century translator, must be\r\ndistinguished on the one hand from Hermann the Lame who wrote on\r\nthe astrolabe,[224] and apparently on the other hand from Hermann\r\nthe German who translated Averroes and Aristotle in the thirteenth\r\ncentury.[225] To the twelfth century translator we may ascribe\r\nsuch works as a treatise on rains,[226] a brief glossary of Arabic\r\nastronomical terms,[227] and Latin versions of the _Planisphere_\r\nof Ptolemy,[228] of the astrological _Fatidica_ of Zahel,[229] and\r\nof the _Introduction to Astronomy_ in eight books of the noted\r\nArabic astrologer Albumasar, a work often entitled _Searching of the\r\nHeart_ or _Of Things Occult_.[230] Hermann dedicated it to Robert of\r\nChester, whom he also mentions in the preface of his translation of\r\nthe _Planisphere_,[231] and in his chief work, the _De essentiis_, a\r\ncosmology which he finished at Béziers in the latter part of the same\r\nyear 1143.[232]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Hugh of Santalla.]\r\n\r\nHugo Sanctelliensis or Hugh of Santalla[233] is another translator of\r\nthe first half of the twelfth century in the Spanish peninsula who\r\nappears to have worked independently of the foregoing men, since he to\r\nsome extent translated the same works, for instance, the _Centiloquium_\r\nascribed to Ptolemy, Latin versions of which have also been credited to\r\nPlato of Tivoli and John of Seville. Hugh’s translations are undated\r\nbut at least some of them may have antedated those of the men already\r\nmentioned,[234] since Haskins has identified Hugh’s patron, “my\r\nlord, Bishop Michael,” with the holder of the see of Tarazona from\r\n1119 to 1151. Hugh’s nine known translations are concerned with works\r\nof astronomy, astrology, and divination. Those on astrology include,\r\nbesides the _Centiloquium_ already mentioned, Albumasar’s _Book of\r\nRains_, Messahala on nativities, and a _Book of Aristotle from 255\r\nvolumes of the Indians_, of which we shall have more to say in the\r\nchapter on the Pseudo-Aristotle. The works on other forms of divination\r\nare a geomancy[235] and _De spatula_, a treatise on divination from\r\nthe shoulder-blades of animals. In the preface to the geomancy he\r\npromises to treat next of hydromancy but says that he has failed to\r\nfind books of aeromancy or pyromancy.[236] Although, as has been said,\r\nHugh seems to have labored independently of the other translators\r\nand in a somewhat out-of-the-way town, he nevertheless seems to have\r\nfelt himself in touch with the learning of his time. In his various\r\nprefaces, like William of Conches, he speaks of “moderns” as well as\r\nthe arcana of the ancients,[237] and his patron is continually urging\r\nhim to write not only what he has gathered from the books of the\r\nancients but what he has learned by experiment.[238] In the preface\r\nto his translation of Albumasar’s _Book of Rains_ he tells Bishop\r\nMichael that “what the modern astrologers of the Gauls most bemoan\r\ntheir lack of, your benignity may bestow upon posterity,”[239] and the\r\ndistribution of manuscripts of his translations in European libraries\r\nindicates that they were widely influential.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A contemporary memorial of Gerard of Cremona.]\r\n\r\nThe best source for the life and works of Gerard of Cremona[240]\r\n(1114-1187) is a memorandum attached by his friends to what was\r\npresumably his last work, a translation of the _Tegni_ of Galen with\r\nthe commentary of Haly, in imitation of Galen who in old age was\r\ninduced to draw up a list of his own works. Gerard, however, is already\r\ndead when his associates write, having worked right up to life’s close\r\nand passed away in 1187 at the age of seventy-three. They state that\r\nfrom the very cradle he was educated in the lap of philosophy, and\r\nthat he learned all he could in every department of it studied among\r\nthe Latins. Then, moved by his passion for the Almagest, which he\r\nfound nowhere among the Latins, he came to Toledo. There, beholding\r\nthe abundance of books in every field in Arabic and the poverty\r\nof the Latins in this respect, he devoted his life to the labor of\r\ntranslation, scorning the desires of the flesh, although he was rich in\r\nworldly goods, and adhering to things of the spirit alone. He toiled\r\nfor the advantage of all both present and future, not unmindful of\r\nthe injunction of Ptolemy to work good increasingly as you near your\r\nend. Now, that his name may not be hidden in silence and darkness,\r\nand that no alien name may be inscribed by presumptuous thievery in\r\nhis translations, the more so since he (like Galen) never signed his\r\nown name to any of them, they have drawn up a list of all the works\r\ntranslated by him whether in dialectic or geometry, in “astrology” or\r\nphilosophy, in medicine or in the other sciences.[241]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Account by a pupil of his astrological teaching.]\r\n\r\nAnother contemporary picture of Gerard’s activity at Toledo is provided\r\nus by the Englishman, Daniel of Morley, or _de Merlai_, who went to\r\nSpain to study the sciences of the _quadrivium_. He tells how Gerard of\r\nToledo (_Gerardus tholetanus_), interpreting the Almagest in Latin with\r\nthe aid of Galippus, the Mozarab,[242] asserted that various future\r\nevents followed necessarily from the movements and influences of the\r\nstars. Daniel was at first astounded by this utterance and brought\r\nforward the arguments against the _mathematici_ or astrologers in the\r\nhomily of St. Gregory. But Gerard answered them all glibly. It should\r\nperhaps be added that in another passage Daniel without mentioning\r\nGerard speaks of setting down in Latin what he learned concerning the\r\nuniverse in the speech of Toledo from Galippus, the Mozarab.[243]\r\nGerard’s translation of the Almagest seems to have been completed in\r\n1175,[244] but meanwhile in Sicily an anonymous translation from the\r\nGreek had appeared, probably soon after 1160. Of it we shall presently\r\nhave something to say. Gerard’s version was, however, the generally\r\naccepted one, as the number of manuscripts and citations of it show.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Character of Gerard’s translations.]\r\n\r\nBut to return to the list of Gerard’s translations. Only three of the\r\nlong list are strictly dialectical, Aristotle’s _Posterior Analytics_,\r\nthe commentary of Themistius upon them, and Alfarabi on the syllogism.\r\nAnd only one or two of the translations listed under the heading\r\n_De phylosophya_ are pure philosophy.[245] Most of Gerard’s work is\r\nmathematical and medical, natural and occult science. He translates\r\nPtolemy and Euclid; Archimedes, Galen and Aristotle; Autolycus and\r\nTheodosius; and such writers in Arabic as Alkindi, Alfarabi, Albucasis,\r\nAlfraganus, Messahala, Thebit, Geber, Alhazen, Isaac, Rasis, and\r\nAvicenna. His mathematical translations include the fields of algebra\r\nand perspective as well as geometry and astronomy. Of Aristotle’s\r\nnatural philosophy the list includes the _Physics_, _De coelo et\r\nmundo_, _De generatione et corruptione_, _De meteoris_ except the\r\nfourth and last book which he could not find,[246] and the first part\r\nof the astrological _De causis proprietatum et elementorum_ ascribed\r\nto Aristotle. Among his translations of Galen was the apocryphal _De\r\nsecretis_, of which we shall have more to say in a later chapter on\r\nbooks of experiments. Three treatises of alchemy are included in the\r\nlist of his translations and also a geomancy, although Boncompagni\r\ntries to saddle the latter upon Gerardus de Sabloneto. Gerard is also\r\nsupposed to have translated some works not mentioned in this list but\r\nascribed to him in the manuscripts. One of interest to us is a work on\r\nstones of the Pseudo-Aristotle.[247]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Science and religion in the preface to a translation of the\r\n_Almagest_ from the Greek.]\r\n\r\nWe must say a word of the anonymous Sicilian translation of the\r\n_Almagest_ which preceded that of Gerard of Cremona, because of a\r\ndefense in its preface[248] of natural science against a theological\r\nopposition of which the anonymous translator appears to be painfully\r\nconscious. After darkly hinting that he was prevented from speedily\r\ncompleting the translation by “other secret” obstacles[249] as well as\r\nby the manifest fact that he did not understand “the science of the\r\nstars” well,[250] and remarking that the artisan can hope for nothing\r\nwhere the art is in disrepute, the translator inveighs against those\r\nwho rashly judge things about which they know nothing, and who, lest\r\nthey seem ignorant themselves, call what they do not know useless\r\nand profane. Hence the Arabs say that there is no greater enemy of\r\nan art than one who is unacquainted with it. So far the tone of the\r\npreface reminds one strongly of those of William of Conches. The writer\r\nproceeds to complain that the opposition to mathematical studies has\r\ngone so far that “the science of numbers and mensuration is thought\r\nentirely superfluous and useless, while the study of astronomy (i.\r\ne. astrology) is esteemed idolatry.”[251] Yet Remigius tells us that\r\nAbraham taught the Egyptians “astrology” (i. e. astronomy), and the\r\ntranslator ironically adds that he supposes it can be shown from Moses\r\nand Daniel that God condemned the science of the stars. He then dilates\r\non how essential it is to study and understand the created world before\r\nrising to study of the Creator, and waxes sarcastic at the expense\r\nof those who study theology before they know anything else and think\r\nthemselves able like eagles to soar aloft at once above the clouds,\r\ndisdaining earth and earthly things, and to gaze unblinded upon the\r\nfull sun:[252]--a passage somewhat similar to Roger Bacon’s diatribe\r\nagainst the “boy-theologians” in the following century.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Arabs and moderns.]\r\n\r\nThe translator, although his own rendition is from a Greek manuscript,\r\nshows some familiarity with Arabic learning. Besides the Arabic saying\r\nalready quoted, in giving the Greek title of Ptolemy’s thirteen books\r\non astronomy he adds that the Saracens call it by the corrupt name,\r\n_elmeguisti_ (i. e. _Almagest_).[253] He also acknowledges the aid\r\nhe has received from Eugene, the admiral or emir, whose translation\r\nof Ptolemy’s _Optics_ from the Arabic we have mentioned elsewhere,\r\nand whom he describes as equally skilled in Greek and Arabic, and\r\n“also not ignorant of Latin.” It may also be noted that as Adelard\r\nof Bath contrasted “the writings of men of old” with “the science of\r\nmoderns,”[254] so this translator characterizes Ptolemy as _veterum\r\nlima, specculum modernorum_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Astronomy at Marseilles.]\r\n\r\nThis seems the best place to call attention to some evidence for the\r\nexistence of astronomical, and apparently also astrological, activity\r\nat Marseilles in the twelfth century, seemingly under the influence of\r\nthe Arabic astronomy and astrology. In a manuscript at Paris which the\r\ncatalogue dates of the twelfth century[255] is a treatise formerly\r\nsaid to have been composed at Marseilles in the year 1111 A. D. But\r\nDuhem has suggested that the XI should be XL, since the author tells of\r\na dispute at Marseilles in 1139.[256] The text tells how to find the\r\nlocation of the planets for the city of Marseilles and is accompanied\r\nby astronomical tables imitating Azarchel. The same treatise appears\r\nin a manuscript at Cambridge,[257] written before the year 1175,\r\nwhere it is entitled “The Book of the Courses of the Seven Planets\r\nfor Marseilles” and seems to be attributed to a Raymond of that city.\r\nDuhem notes that our author often cites an earlier treatise of his, _De\r\ncompositione astrolabii_. The treatise opens with allusion to “many\r\nof the Indians and Chaldeans and Arabs”; the author also says, “And\r\nsince we were the first of the Latins to whom this science came after\r\nthe translation of the Arabs,” and avers that he employs the Christian\r\ncalendar and chronology in order to avoid all appearance of heresy or\r\ninfidelity. So we would seem to be justified in connecting it with the\r\ndiffusion of Arabic astronomy and astrology. Our author believes that\r\nGod endowed the sky with the virtue of presaging the future, cites\r\nvarious authorities sacred and profane in favor of astrology, and\r\nemphasizes especially the importance of astrological medicine.[258]\r\nIt was also at Marseilles that William of England early in the next\r\ncentury in the year 1219 wrote his brief but very popular treatise,\r\nfound in many manuscripts, entitled “Of Urine Unseen” (_De urina non\r\nvisa_), that is, how by astrology to diagnose a case and tell the color\r\nand substance of the urine without seeing it. Of it we shall treat\r\nagain later in connection with thirteenth century medicine. But we may\r\nnote here that William, although of English nationality, was a citizen\r\nof Marseilles, and that the person to whom his work _Of Urine Unseen_\r\nwas addressed had formerly studied with him at Marseilles. William is\r\nalso spoken of as a professor of medicine. Furthermore in at least one\r\nmanuscript William of England is called a translator from the Arabic,\r\nsince he is said to have translated from that tongue into Latin “The\r\nvery great Secret of Catenus, king of the Persians, concerning the\r\nvirtue of the eagle.”[259] We may also note that it was in reply to\r\ninquiries which he had received from Jews of Marseilles that Moses\r\nMaimonides in 1194 addressed to them his letter on astrology.[260]\r\nInterest in astronomy and astrology thus appears to have prevailed at\r\nMarseilles from the first half to the close of the twelfth century.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[159] Especially by Professor C. H. Haskins, who has corrected or\r\nsupplemented Steinschneider and others on various points, and who has\r\nother studies in preparation in addition to those to be mentioned in\r\nensuing footnotes of this chapter.\r\n\r\n[160] The passage is reproduced by C.

Its prologue speaks of an abridgement of the Almagest by\r\nAverroes which Alfonso the Great (presumably Alfonso X or the Wise of\r\nCastile, 1252-1284) had had translated and which was in circulation in\r\nSpain and at Bologna. From the Explicit of the same treatise one would\r\ninfer that two Alfonsos were engaged in its translation, one a son of\r\nDionysius of Lisbon, and the other a convert, who became a sacristan\r\nat Toledo:--“_et iste tractatus translatus fuit a magistro Alfonsio\r\nDionysii de Ulixbona Hispano apud Vallem Toleti, interprete magistro\r\nAlfonso converso, sacrista Toletano_.” The treatise is followed at\r\nfol. 194v by a “Narration concerning Averroes and the Saracen king of\r\nCordova,” which opens, “This is worth knowing which was told me by\r\nAlfonso, a trustworthy Jew, physician of the king of Castile.”\r\n\r\n[163] Amplon.

Digby 190, 13-14th century,\r\nfol. 87, gives the Arabic year as 529, while its 1173 should obviously\r\nnot be A. D. but of the Spanish era. Corpus Christi 224 gives the\r\nArabic year as 528, and the era date has been altered to clxx. m.\r\n(1170), probably from mclxxiii (1173), the initial ‘m’ dropping out,\r\nand the final ‘iii’ in consequence being misread by a copyist as\r\n‘m.’ The same careless copyist has perhaps dropped an ‘i’ from the\r\narabic year.

Marco XI-102, fols. 107-31, and XI-104,\r\nfols. 1-30, the title is “epitome artis astrologiae.” Vienna 5442, 15th\r\ncentury, fols. 158r-79v, Opus quadripartitum de iudiciis astrorum, has\r\nthe same Incipit, “Zodiacus dividitur in duodecim....” See also Amplon.\r\nOctavo 84, 14th century, fols. 1-37, and Quarto 377, 14th century,\r\nfols. 7-11, Iudicia Iohannis Hispalensis, and BN 7321, 1448 A.

D., fols. 39-47, does not\r\nname the translator but gives the date as 1153, and the same MS,\r\nfols. 24-9, contains John of Seville’s translations of a work on the\r\nastrolabe in 40 chapters, of treatises by Messahalla at fols. 48-55,\r\nand Aomar at fols. 56-64.\r\n\r\nRoyal 12-C-XVIII, 14th century, fols. 2-9v, ends incomplete, but a\r\ncolophon added in another hand gives the date as 1152.\r\n\r\nThe work was printed at Nürnberg, 1546.\r\n\r\nThere is a different translation of it, made by Plato of Tivoli in 1136\r\nA. D., in Cotton Appendix VI, fol. 163-, Aubueli liber in judiciis\r\nnativitatum quem Plato Tiburtinus ex Arabico sumpsit Ao. Arabum 530 et\r\nalexandri 1447 in civitate Barkelona.\r\n\r\n[188] Steinschneider ascribes the translation of Albohali to John\r\nof Spain; the Catalogue of the Royal Manuscripts says that Johannes\r\nToletanus is possibly the same as John of Spain. Sudhoff (1917), p. 17,\r\nidentifies “Johann von Toledo (Hispanus, Avendehut).”\r\n\r\nPerhaps, however, the John of Toledo to whom a treatise entitled, _De\r\nconservanda sanitate_, is ascribed in two 14th century MSS at Paris, BN\r\n6978, #1 and 16222, fol. 76-; also Berlin 905, 15th century, fol. 74-;\r\nCU Gonville and Caius 95, 15th century, fol. 283-; was not the same\r\nperson.\r\n\r\nRose, in the Berlin MSS catalogue, identifies this last John of Toledo\r\nwith a John David of Toledo who in 1322 joined with other astrologers\r\nin issuing a threatening circular letter predicting terrible events for\r\nthe year 1329. See Amplon. Quarto 371 for another such letter for the\r\nyear 1371, and Amplon.

Ludwig Baur, in _Beiträge_, IV, 2-3, Münster, 1903, pp. 1-144\r\ntext; pp. 145-408 “Untersuchung.” Another work by Gundissalinus on the\r\nimmortality of the soul was published in the same series by G. F. von\r\nHertling, 1897.\r\n\r\nBaur unfortunately failed to note the existence of the _De divisione\r\nphilosophiae_ in two 13th century MSS at the British Museum in the\r\nSloane collection, nor does Scott’s Index catalogue of the Sloane MSS\r\nmention Gundissalinus as their author.\r\n\r\nSloane 2946, 13th century, fols. 209-16, “de philosophia ... auctore\r\nIsaaco philosopho.” But the Incipit, “Felix prior aetas qui (quae)\r\ntot sapientes ...” is that of Gundissalinus’ treatise. The erroneous\r\nascription to Isaac is probably owing to the fact that the treatise\r\njust preceding, at fols. 205-208v, is a translation of a medical work\r\nby Isaac. This MS is mutilated towards the close so that the leaves\r\ncontaining our text have the upper right hand corner torn off, thus\r\nremoving nearly one-sixth of the text. The colophon reads, “Explicit\r\nhoc opus a domino Gundissalini apud Tholetum editum, sdens (succedens?)\r\nde assignanda causa ex qua orte sunt scientie philosophie et ordo\r\neorum et disciplina.” Similarly in Baur’s text the _De divisione\r\nphilosophiae_ at pp. 1-142 is followed at pp. 142-44 by Alfarabi’s\r\n“Epistola de assignanda causa ex qua orte sunt scientie philosophie et\r\nordo earum in disciplina.”\r\n\r\nSloane 2461, late 13th century, fols. 1-38r, contains the _De divisione\r\nphilosophiae_ under the caption, _Compendium scientiarum_, without\r\nindication of the author. It also is immediately followed at fols.\r\n38v-40r by _De unitate_, which Baur found in another MS at the close of\r\nGundissalinus’ _De divisione philosophiae_, and in a third MS before\r\nthe above mentioned letter of Alfarabi.\r\n\r\nA MS now lost is, Library of St. Augustine’s Abbey, Canterbury, 1175,\r\nGundisalvus de ortu et divisione scientiarum.\r\n\r\nCotton Vespasian B-X, fols. 24-27, Alpharabius de divisione omnium\r\nscientiarum, is not the treatise of Gundissalinus, as I was at first\r\ninclined to suspect that it might turn out to be upon examination.\r\n\r\nAlfarabi’s _De scientiis_ was published in his _Opera omnia_ by\r\nCamerarius at Paris in 1638 from a MS which the preface represented\r\nas a recent discovery. Baur, p. viii, states that this text differs\r\nconsiderably from the Latin version by Gerard of Cremona, but that the\r\nborrowings of Gundissalinus from Alfarabi and the citations in Vincent\r\nof Beauvais’ _Speculum doctrinale_ agree with this 1638 text rather\r\nthan with Gerard’s.\r\n\r\n[204] Baur (1903), p. 163.\r\n\r\n[205] Karpinski (1915), p. 23.\r\n\r\n[206] Baur, pp. 4-5.\r\n\r\n[207] Baur, p. 20.\r\n\r\n[208] Baur, p. 89.\r\n\r\n[209] See Daniel Morley on the eight parts of astrology in chapter 42\r\nbelow, p. 177.\r\n\r\n[210] I have read it in two MSS at Paris, where, however, the text\r\nseems faulty: BN 6298, 14th century, fols. 160r-161v, and BN 14700,\r\nfols. 328v-330v. It opens, “Scias nihil esse nisi substantia et\r\naccidens et creatorem substantie et accidentis in secula.” Printed in\r\n_Beiträge_, xix.\r\n\r\n[211] For Bacon’s views see below, chapter 61.\r\n\r\n[212] BN 6298, fol. 160v; BN 14700, fol. 330r. “Scientia divina que est\r\nfinis scientiarum et perfectio earum. Et non restat post illam ulla\r\ninquisitio. Ipsa enim est finis ad quem tendit omnis inquisitio et in\r\nea quiescit.”\r\n\r\n[213] “Et imo opus erat (fuit) scientia que hoc totum ostendit scilicet\r\nper quam veniremus ad huiusmodi permutationis scientiam (perveniremus\r\nad scientiam huius permutationis) qualiter fiat et que sint eius\r\nactiones nocentes (occasiones et cause et quomodo possemus removere has\r\noccasiones nocentes) cum vellemus repellere et quomodo cum vellemus\r\npossemus eas augere. Hec igitur scientia fuit scientia de naturis que\r\nest scientia de actione et passione.” The passages in parentheses are\r\nthe variant readings in one of the two MSS.\r\n\r\n[214] For the passages cited in this paragraph see Baur, 6, 115, 119-21.\r\n\r\n[215] Baur, who lists MSS of the work at p. 368 and presents an\r\nanalysis of it at pp. 369-75, gives the title as _De ortu et divisione\r\nphilosophiae_, but the two 13th century MSS at Oxford, Balliol 3 and\r\nMerton 261, seem to prefer the form which I have given. I have looked\r\nthrough the text in Balliol 3, a beautifully written MS, but, in\r\nview of Kilwardby’s date, scarcely of the early 13th century, as it\r\nis described in the catalogue. Hauréau regarded the work as clear,\r\naccurate, and worth printing.\r\n\r\n[216] Cap. 40.\r\n\r\n[217] Cap. 67.\r\n\r\n[218] Listed by Steinschneider (1905), pp. 62-6.\r\n\r\n[219] C. H.

He says, “Hermannus Alemannus,\r\noder Teutonicus, Germanicus, soll um 1240-1260 Lehrer des Roger Bacon\r\nin Toledo (?) gewesen sein,” but I do not know where he gets the notion\r\nthat Hermann was Roger’s teacher. The following works ascribed to\r\nHermannus Theutonicus by Denifle (1886), p. 231,--and not mentioned by\r\nSteinschneider--seem to indicate another person of that name: “(41)\r\nfr. Hermannus Theutonicus de Cerwist (Zerbst) scripsit postillam super\r\ncantica; (50) fr. Hermannus Theutonicus scripsit librum de ascensu\r\ncordis. Item super Cantica. Item de arte precandi.” In Vienna 2507,\r\n13th century, fols. 85-123, an Ars dictandi is attributed to “Magistri\r\nHeremanni.”\r\n\r\nOn the part taken by Hermannus Alemannus in the translation of\r\nAristotle in the thirteenth century see further Grabmann (1916), pp.\r\n208-12, 217-22, etc., where translations of his are connected with the\r\ndates 1240 and 1254.\r\n\r\n[226] Clare College 15 (Kk. 4. 2), c. 1280 A.

But in Digby\r\n114, 14th century, fols. 176-99, “Explicit fetidica Zael Benbinxeir\r\nCaldei. Translacio hec mam. Gi. astronomie libri anno Domini 1138, 3\r\nkal. Octobris translatus est.”\r\n\r\n[230] Printed at Augsburg in 1489 and in other editions; it opens,\r\n“Astronomie iudiciorum omnium bispertita est via....”\r\n\r\n[231] Suter (1914), pp. xiii, xviii, interprets Hermann’s words, “Quem\r\nlocum a Ptolemaeo minus diligenter perspectum cum Albatene miratur et\r\nAlchoarismus, quorum hunc quidam opera nostra Latium habet, illius\r\nvero commodissima translatio Roberti mei industria Latinae orationis\r\nthesaurum accumulat,” to mean that Robert translated Al-Battani, but\r\nin view of Robert’s known translations of Al-Khowarizmi, I should\r\ntranslate _hunc_ as “former” in this case and regard Hermann as the\r\ntranslator of Al-Battani.\r\n\r\n[232] Professor Haskins wrote me on July 26, 1921, “The _De essentiis_\r\nis an interesting work of cosmology; when I am able to work it over\r\nmore carefully I shall print the article on Hermann, now long overdue.”\r\n\r\n[233] The best treatment of Hugh is, C. H. Haskins, “The Translations\r\nof Hugo Sanctelliensis,” in _The Romanic Review_, II (1911), 1-15,\r\nwhere attention is called to translations not noted by Steinschneider,\r\nand the prefaces of seven extant translations are printed.\r\n\r\n[234] I cannot, however, agree with Professor Haskins (p. 10), that\r\n“From certain phrases in the preface” (of Hugh’s translation of the\r\n_Liber Aristotilis de 255 indorum voluminibus_) “it would seem that,\r\nwhile Hugo has been for some time a devotee of Arabian science, he\r\nhas only recently (_nunc_) and comparatively late in the day (_serus\r\nac indignus minister_) entered the bishop’s service.” It seems to me\r\nthat the last phrase should read _servus ac indignus minister_, for\r\nHugh had already translated at least one other work for the bishop\r\nbefore this one on the 255 books of the Indians, and in the present\r\npreface he alludes to many previous discussions between them and to the\r\nbishop’s continually exhorting him to publish, so that one would infer\r\nthat they had been associated for some time past. Since writing this I\r\nhave learned both from Mr. H. H. E. Craster of the Bodleian and from\r\nProfessor Haskins himself that the reading in the MS (Digby 159, fol.\r\n1v) is “seruus” or _servus_, as I have it in the rough notes I took on\r\nthe treatise in August, 1919.\r\n\r\n[235] The following MSS may be noted in addition to those (BN 7453\r\nand Florence, Laur. II-85, Plut. 30, c. 29) listed by Steinschneider\r\n(1905), pp. 35-6, and Haskins (1911), p. 13.\r\n\r\nCU Magdalene 27, late 14th century, fols. 1-66, “Ludus philosophorum\r\nqui apellatur filius (?)

In the preface to the\r\nPseudo-Aristotle on the 255 books of the Indians he speaks of Bishop\r\nMichael as exalted above moderns or contemporaries (_ultra modernos\r\nvel coequevos_,--Haskins, 10) in fame and love of learning, and later\r\nof “what can be fully explained by none of the moderns” (_quod a\r\nnullo modernorum plenissime valet explicari_--Haskins, p. 11).

I\r\nhave, except for changing the order, practically translated the Latin\r\ntext of the _Vita_, which with some omissions is as follows: “... Ne\r\nigitur magister gerardus cremonensis sub taciturnitatis tenebris lateat\r\n... ne per presumptuosam rapinam libris ab ipso translatis titulus\r\ninfigatur alienus presertim cum nulli eorum nomen suum iscripsisset,\r\ncuncta opera ab eodem translata tam de dyalectica quam de geometria,\r\ntam de astrologia quam de phylosophya, tam etiam de physica quam\r\nde aliis scientiis, in fine huius tegni novissime ab eo translati,\r\nimitando Galenum de commemoratione suorum librorum in fine eiusdem\r\nper socios ipsius diligentissime fuerint connumerata....

XIX, 1-6._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Problem of his identity.]\r\n\r\nBernard Silvester, of whom this chapter will treat, is now generally\r\nrecognized as a different person from the Bernard of Chartres whom\r\nWilliam of Conches followed and on whose teaching John of Salisbury\r\nlooked back.[261] From John’s account it is plain that Bernard of\r\nChartres belonged to the generation before William of Conches, and\r\nClerval has shown reason to believe that he was dead by 1130.[262]\r\nBernard Silvester, on the other hand, wrote his _De mundi universitate_\r\nduring the pontificate of Eugenius III, 1145-1153. Moreover, one of\r\nhis pupils informs us that he taught at Tours.[263] This last fact\r\nalso makes it difficult, although not impossible, to identify him\r\nwith a Breton, named Bernard de Moelan, who, after serving as canon\r\nand chancellor at Chartres, became bishop of Quimper from 1159 to\r\n1167.[264] At least they appear to have had somewhat similar interests,\r\nand Silvester seems to have had some connection with the school of\r\nChartres, since he dedicated the _De mundi universitate_ to Theodoric\r\nof Chartres.[265]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: His works.]\r\n\r\nA number of works are extant under the name of Bernard Silvester. His\r\ninterest in rhetoric and poetry is shown by a long _Summa dictaminis_\r\n(or, _dictaminum_) and by a _Liber de metrificatura_, in the\r\n_Titulus_ of which he is called “a poet of the first rank” (_optimi\r\npoetae_).[266] He also wrote a commentary on the first books of the\r\n_Aeneid_.[267] Two other treatises are ascribed to him in which we are\r\nnot here further interested, namely: _De forma vitae honestae_ and _De\r\ncura rei familiaris_ or _Epistola ad Raimundum de modo rei familiaris\r\ngubernandae_.[268] The three works of especial interest to us, while\r\nno one of them is exactly a treatise on astrology, all illustrate,\r\nalbeit each in a different way, the dominance of astrological doctrine\r\nin the thought of the time. One is _Experimentarius_, an astrological\r\ngeomancy translated into verse from the Arabic.[269] Another is a\r\nnarrative poem whose plot hinges upon an astrologer’s prediction and\r\nwhose very title is _Mathematicus_.[270] The third work, variously\r\nentitled _De mundi universitate_, _Megacosmus et Microcosmus_, and\r\n_Cosmographia_[271] has much to say of the stars and their rule over\r\ninferior creation.[272] It is written partly in prose and partly in\r\nverse,[273] and shows that Bernard laid as much stress on literary form\r\nin his scientific or pseudo-scientific works as in those on rhetoric\r\nand meter. Sandys says of it, “The rhythm of the hexameters is clearly\r\nthat of Lucan, while the vocabulary is mainly that of Ovid”; but Dr.\r\nPoole believes that the hexameters are modelled upon Lucretius.[274] He\r\nwould date it either in 1145 or about 1147-1148.[275]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Their influence.]\r\n\r\nThe manuscripts of these three works are fairly numerous, indicating\r\nthat they were widely read, and no contemporary objection appears to\r\nhave been raised against their rather extreme astrological doctrines.\r\nAs was well observed concerning the _De mundi universitate_ over one\r\nhundred and fifty years ago, “These extravagances and some other\r\nsimilar ones did not prevent the book from achieving a very brilliant\r\nsuccess from the moment of its first appearance,” as is shown by the\r\ncontemporary testimony of Peter Cantor in the closing twelfth century\r\nand Eberhart de Bethune in the early thirteenth century, who says\r\nthat the _De mundi universitate_ was read in the schools. Gervaise of\r\nTilbury and Vincent of Beauvais also cited it.[276] Indeed in our next\r\nchapter we shall find a Christian abbess, saint, and prophetess of\r\nBernard’s own time charged--by a modern writer, it is true--with making\r\nuse of it in her visions. Passages from Silvester are included in a\r\nthirteenth century collection of “Proverbs” from ancient and recent\r\nwriters,[277] and more than one copy of the _De mundi universitate_\r\nis listed in such a medieval monastic library as St. Augustine’s,\r\nCanterbury.[278]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Disregard of Christian theology.]\r\n\r\nIn the _De mundi universitate_ we see the same influence of Platonism\r\nand astronomy, and of the Latin translation of the _Timaeus_ in\r\nespecial, as in the _Philosophia_ of William of Conches. At the\r\nsame time, its abstract personages and personified sciences,\r\nits _Nous_ and _Natura_, its _Urania_ and _Physis_ with her two\r\ndaughters, _Theoretical and Practical_, remind us of the pages of\r\nMartianus Capella and of Adelard of Bath’s _De eodem et diverso_. The\r\ncharacterization by Dr. Poole that the work “has an entirely pagan\r\ncomplexion,” and that Bernard’s scheme of cosmology is pantheistic\r\nand takes no account of Christian theology,[279] is essentially true,\r\nalthough occasionally some utterance indicates that the writer is\r\nacquainted with Christianity and no true pagan. Perhaps it is just\r\nbecause Bernard makes no pretense of being a theologian, that at a time\r\nwhen William of Conches was retracting in his _Dragmaticon_ some of the\r\nviews expressed in his _Philosophia_ and the Sicilian translator was\r\nconscious of a bigoted theological opposition, Bernard should display\r\nneither fear nor consciousness of the existence of any such opposition.\r\nAnd yet it does not appear that the Sicilian translator engaged in\r\ntheological discussion. Yet he complains of those who call astronomy\r\nidolatry; Bernard calmly calls the stars gods, and no one seems to have\r\nraised the least objection. At least Bernard’s fearless outspokenness\r\nand its subsequent popularity should prevent our laying too much stress\r\nupon the timidity of other writers in expressing new views, and should\r\nmake us hesitate before interpreting their attitude as a sure sign\r\nof real danger to freedom of thought and speech, and to scientific\r\ninvestigation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The divine stars.]\r\n\r\nWhat especially concerns our investigation are the views concerning\r\nstars and spirits expressed by Silvester. Like William of Conches, he\r\ndescribes the world of spirits in a Platonic or Neo-Platonic, rather\r\nthan patristic, style. He differs from William in hardly using the word\r\n“demon” at all and in according the stars, like Adelard of Bath, a much\r\nhigher place in his hierarchy. “The heaven itself is full of God,” says\r\nBernard, “and the sky has its own animals, sidereal fires,”[280] just\r\nas man, who is in part a spiritual being, inhabits the earth. Bernard\r\ndoes not hesitate to call the stars “gods who serve God in person,”\r\nor “who serve in God’s very presence.”[281] There in the region of\r\npurer ether which extends as far as the sun they enjoy the vision of\r\nbliss eternal, free from all care and distraction, and resting in the\r\npeace of God which passeth all understanding.[282] He also repeats\r\nthe Platonic doctrine that the mind is from the sky and that the human\r\nsoul, when at last it lays aside the body, “will return to its kindred\r\nstars, added as a god to the number of superior beings.”[283]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Orders of spirits.]\r\n\r\nBetween heaven and earth, between God and man, comes the mediate and\r\ncomposite order of “angelic creation.” “With the divinity of the\r\nstars” the members of this order share the attribute of deathlessness;\r\nwith man they have this in common, to be stirred by passion and\r\nimpulse.[284] Between sun and moon are benevolent angels who act as\r\nmediums between God and man. Other spirits inhabit the air beneath the\r\nmoon. Some of them display an affinity to the near-by ether and fire,\r\nand live in tranquillity and mental serenity, although dwelling in the\r\nair. A second variety are the _genii_ who are associated each with some\r\nman from birth to warn and guide him. But in the lower atmosphere are\r\ndisorderly and malignant spirits who often are divinely commissioned\r\nto torment evil-doers, or sometimes torment men of their own volition.\r\nOften they invisibly invade human minds and thoughts by silent\r\nsuggestion; again they assume bodies and take on ghostly forms. These\r\nBernard calls _angelos desertores_, or fallen angels. But there are\r\nstill left to be noted the spirits who inhabit the earth, on mountains\r\nor in forests and by streams: _Silvani_, Pans, and _Nerei_. They are\r\nof harmless character (_innocua conversatione_) and, being composed\r\nof the elements in a pure state, are long-lived but in the process of\r\ntime will dissolve again.[285] This classification of spirits seems to\r\nfollow Martianus Capella.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The stars rule nature and reveal the future.]\r\n\r\nBernard’s assertion that the stars are gods is accompanied, as one\r\nwould naturally expect, by a belief in their control of nature and\r\nrevelation of the future. From their proximity to God they receive\r\nfrom His mind the secrets of the future, which they “establish through\r\nthe lower species of the universe by inevitable necessity.”[286]\r\nLife comes to the world of nature from the sky as if from God, and\r\nthe creatures of the earth, air, and water could not move from their\r\ntracks, did they not absorb vivifying motions from the sky.[287] _Nous_\r\nor Intelligence says to Nature, “I would have you behold the sky,\r\ninscribed with a multiform variety of images, which, like a book with\r\nopen pages, containing the future in cryptic letters, I have revealed\r\nto the eyes of the more learned.”[288] In another passage Bernard\r\naffirms that God writes in the stars of the sky what can come “from\r\nfatal law,” that the movements of the stars control all ages, that\r\nthere already is latent in the stars a series of events which long time\r\nwill unfold, and that all the events of history, even the birth of\r\nChrist, have been foreshadowed by the stars.\r\n\r\n    “Scribit enim caelum stellis totumque figurat\r\n      Quod de fatali lege venire potest,\r\n    Praesignat qualique modo qualique tenore\r\n      Omnia sidereus saecula motus agat.\r\n    Praejacet in stellis series quam longior aetas\r\n      Explicet et spatiis temporis ordo suis:\r\n    Sceptra Phoronei, fratrum discordia Thebae,\r\n      Flammae Phaëthonis, Deucalionis aquae.\r\n    In stellis Codri paupertas, copia Croesi,\r\n      Incestus Paridis, Hippolytique pudor;\r\n    In stellis Priami species, audacia Turni,\r\n      Sensus Ulixeus, Herculeusque vigor.\r\n    In stellis pugil est Pollux, et navita Typhis,\r\n      Et Cicero rhetor, et geometra Thales;\r\n    In stellis lepidus dictat Maro, Milo figurat,\r\n      Fulgurat in latia nobilitate Nero.\r\n    Astra notat Persis, Aegyptus parturit artes,\r\n      Graecia docta legit, praelia Roma gerit.\r\n    Exemplar specimenque Dei virguncula Christum\r\n      Parturit, et verum saecula numen habent.”[289]\r\n\r\nYet Bernard urges man to model his life after the stars,[290] and once\r\nspeaks of “what is free in the will and what is of necessity.” He thus\r\nappears, like the author of the treatise on fate ascribed to Plutarch,\r\nlike Boethius, and like a host of other theologians, philosophers, and\r\nastrologers, to believe in the co-existence of free will, inevitable\r\nfate, and “variable fortune.”[291]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Plot of the _Mathematicus_.]\r\n\r\nBernard Silvester’s interest and faith in the art of astrology is\r\nfurther exemplified by his poem _Mathematicus_, a narrative which\r\nthroughout assumes the truth of astrological prediction concerning\r\nhuman fortune. Hauréau showed that it had been incorrectly included\r\namong the works of Hildebert of Tours and Le Mans, and that the theme\r\nis suggested in the fourth Pseudo-Quintillian declamation, but that\r\nBernard has added largely to the plot there briefly outlined. A Roman\r\nknight and lady were in every respect well endowed both by nature and\r\nfortune except that their marriage had up to the moment when the story\r\nopens been a childless one. At last the wife consulted an astrologer\r\nor _mathematicus_, “who could learn from the stars,” we are told, “the\r\nintentions of the gods, the mind of the fates, and the plan of Jove,\r\nand discover the hidden causes and secrets of nature.” He informed her\r\nthat she would bear a son who would become a great genius and the ruler\r\nof Rome, but who would one day kill his father. When the wife told\r\nher husband of this prediction, he made her promise to kill the child\r\nin infancy. But when the time came, her mother love prevailed and she\r\nsecretly sent the boy away to be reared, while she assured her husband\r\nthat he was dead. She named her son _Patricida_ in order that he might\r\nabhor the crime of patricide the more. The boy early gave signs of\r\ngreat intellectual capacity. Among other studies he learned “the\r\norbits of the stars and how human fate is under the stars,” and he\r\n“clasped divine Aristotle to his breast.” Later on, when Rome was hard\r\npressed by the Carthaginians and her king was in captivity, he rallied\r\nher defeated forces and ended the war in triumph.\r\n\r\n    “And because the fatal order demands it so shall be,\r\n    The fates gave him this path to dominion....\r\n    Blind chance sways the silly toiling of men;\r\n    Our world is the plaything and sport of the gods.”\r\n\r\nThe king thereupon abdicated in favor of _Patricida_, whom he addressed\r\nin these words, “O youth, on whose birth, if there is any power in the\r\nstars, a favorable horoscope looked down.”\r\n\r\nThe mother rejoiced to hear of her son’s success, and marveled at\r\nthe correctness of the astrologer’s prediction, but was now the more\r\ntroubled as to her husband’s fate. He noticed her distraction and at\r\nlast induced her to tell him its cause. But then, instead of being\r\nangry at the deception which she had practiced upon him, and instead of\r\nbeing alarmed at the prospect of his own death, he, too, rejoiced in\r\nhis son’s success, and said that he would die happy, if he could but\r\nsee and embrace him. He accordingly made himself known to his son and\r\ntold him how he had once ordered his death but had been thwarted by the\r\neternal predestined order of events, and how some day his son would\r\nslay him, not of evil intent but compelled by the courses of the stars.\r\n“And manifest is the fault of the gods in that you cannot be kinder to\r\nyour father.”\r\n\r\nThe son thereupon determines that he will evade the decree of the stars\r\nby committing suicide. He is represented as soliloquizing as follows:\r\n\r\n    “How is our mind akin to the ethereal stars,\r\n    If it suffers the sad necessity of harsh Lachesis?\r\n    In vain we possess a particle of the divine mind,\r\n    If our reason cannot make provision for itself.\r\n    God so made the elements, so made the fiery stars,\r\n    That man is not subject to the stars.”\r\n\r\nPatricida accordingly summons all the Romans together, and, after\r\ninducing them by an eloquent rehearsal of his great services in their\r\nbehalf to grant him any boon that he may ask, says that his wish is to\r\ndie; and at this point the poem ends, leaving us uninformed whether\r\nthe last part of the astrologer’s prediction remained unfulfilled,\r\nor whether Patricida’s suicide caused his father’s death, or whether\r\npossibly some solution was found in a play upon the word _Patricida_.\r\nHauréau, however, believed that the poem is complete as it stands.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Different interpretations put upon the _Mathematicus_.]\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the poet and his attitude towards astrology have been\r\ninterpreted in diametrically opposite ways by different scholars.\r\nBefore Hauréau it was customary to attribute the poem to Hildebert,\r\narchbishop of Tours, and to regard it as an attack upon astrology.\r\nThe early editors of the _Histoire Littéraire de la France_ supported\r\ntheir assertion that the most judicious men of letters in the eleventh\r\nand twelfth centuries had only a sovereign scorn for the widely\r\ncurrent astrological superstition of their time by citing Hildebert\r\nas ridiculing the art in his _Mathematicus_.[292] A century later\r\nCharles Jourdain again represented Hildebert as turning to ridicule\r\nthe vain speculations of the astrologers.[293] Bourassé, the editor\r\nof Hildebert’s works as they appear in Migne’s _Patrologia Latina_,\r\nseems to have felt that the poem was scarcely an outspoken attack upon\r\nastrology and tried to explain it as an academic exercise which was not\r\nto be taken seriously, but regarded as satire upon judicial astrology.\r\nHauréau not only denied Archbishop Hildebert’s authorship, but took\r\nthe common sense view that the poet believes fully in astrology. It\r\nwould, indeed, be difficult to detect any suggestion of ridicule or\r\nsatire about the poem. Its plot is a tragic one and it seems written in\r\nall seriousness. Even Patricida, despite his assertion that “man is\r\nnot subject to the stars,” does not doubt that he will kill his father\r\nconformably to the learned astrologer’s prediction, if he himself\r\ncontinues to live. It is only by the _tour de force_ of self-slaughter\r\nthat he hopes to cheat fate.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Hildebert’s Hermaphrodite’s horoscope.]\r\n\r\nEven Archbishop Hildebert shows a tendency towards astrology in other\r\npoems attributed to him; for example, in his _Nativity of Christ_\r\nand in a short poem, _The Hermaphrodite_, which reads as follows,\r\nrepresenting the fulfillment of a horoscope:\r\n\r\n “While my pregnant mother bore me in the womb, ’tis said\r\n the gods deliberated what she should bring forth. Phoebus\r\n said, ‘It is a boy’; Mars, ‘A girl’; Juno, ‘Neither.’ So\r\n when I was born, I was a hermaphrodite. When I seek to die,\r\n the goddess says, ‘He shall be slain by a weapon’; Mars,\r\n ‘By crucifixion’; Phoebus, ‘By drowning.’ So it turned out.\r\n A tree shades the water; I climb it; the sword I carry by\r\n chance slips from its scabbard; I myself fall upon it; my\r\n trunk is impaled in the branches; my head falls into the\r\n river. Thus I, man, woman, and neither, suffered flood,\r\n sword, and cross.”[294]\r\n\r\nThis poem has always been greatly admired by students of Latin\r\nliterature for its epigrammatic neatness and conciseness, and has been\r\nthought too good to be the work of a medieval writer, and has been\r\neven attributed to Petronius. Another version, by the medieval poet,\r\nPeter Riga, entitled _De ortu et morte pueri monstruosi_, is longer and\r\nfar less elegant. Hauréau, however, regarded _the Hermaphrodite_ as\r\na medieval composition, since there are no manuscripts of it earlier\r\nthan the twelfth century; but he was in doubt whether to ascribe it\r\nto Hildebert or to Matthew of Vendôme, who in listing his own poems\r\nmentions _hic et haec hermaphroditus homo_.[295]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The art of geomancy.]\r\n\r\nWe turn to the association of the name of Bernard Silvester with the\r\nsuperstitious art of geomancy. It may be briefly defined as a method\r\nof divination in which, by marking down a number of points at random\r\nand then connecting or cancelling them by lines, a number or figure is\r\nobtained which is used as a key to sets of tables or to astrological\r\nconstellations. The only reason for calling this geomancy, that is,\r\ndivination by means of the element earth, would seem to be that at\r\nfirst the marks were made and figures drawn in the sand or dust, like\r\nthose of Archimedes during the siege of Syracuse. But by the middle\r\nages, at least, any kind of writing material would do as well. Although\r\na somewhat more abstruse form of superstition than the ouija board,\r\nit seems to have been nearly as popular in the medieval period as the\r\nouija board is now.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Prologue of the _Experimentarius_.]\r\n\r\nThe name of Bernard Silvester is persistently associated in the\r\nmanuscripts with a work bearing the title _Experimentarius_, which\r\nseems to consist of sets of geomantic tables translated from the\r\nArabic. Its prologue is unmistakable, but it is less easy to make\r\nout what text should go with it and how the text should be arranged.\r\nSometimes the prologue is found alone in the manuscripts,[296] and the\r\ntext which accompanies it in others varies in amount and sometimes\r\nis more or less mixed up with other similar modes of divination. The\r\nprologue is sometimes headed, _Evidencia operis subsequentis_, and\r\nregularly subdivides into three brief sections. The first, opening\r\nwith the words, _Materia huius libelli_, describes the subject-matter\r\nof the text as “the effect and efficacy of the moon and other planets\r\nand of the constellations, which they exert upon inferior things.” The\r\nwriter’s opinion is that God permits mortals who make sane and sober\r\ninquiry to learn by subtle consideration of the constellations many\r\nthings concerning the future and persons who are absent, and that\r\nastrology also gives information concerning human character, health\r\nand sickness, prosperity, fertility of the soil, the state of sea and\r\nair, business matters and journeys. In a second paragraph, opening,\r\n_Utilitas autem huius libelli_, the writer states that the use of his\r\nbook is that one may avoid the perils of which the stars give warning\r\nby penitence and prayers and vows to God who, as the astrologer\r\nAlbumasar admits, controls the stars. And through them the Creator\r\nreveals his will, as in the case of the three Magi who learned from a\r\nstar that a great prophet had been born. Finally, in a paragraph of a\r\nsingle sentence, which opens with the words, _Titulus vero talis est_,\r\nwe are informed that the title is the _Experimentarius_ of Bernard\r\nSilvester, “not because he was the original author but the faithful\r\ntranslator from Arabic into Latin.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Pictures of Bernard Silvester.]\r\n\r\nIn one manuscript which contains the _Experimentarius_ there is twice\r\ndepicted, although the second time in different colors, a seated\r\nhuman figure evidently intended to represent Bernard Silvester. He\r\nis bearded and sits in a chair writing, with a pen in one hand and a\r\nknife or scalpel in the other. Neither miniature is in juxtaposition\r\nto the prologue in which Bernard is named, but in both cases the\r\nfigure is accompanied by five lines of text, written alternately in\r\nred and blue colors and proclaiming that Bernard Silvester is the\r\ntranslator and that the number seven is the basis in this infallible\r\nbook of lot-casting.[297] It would not be safe, however, to accept\r\nthis miniature as an accurate representation of Bernard, since the\r\nmanuscript is not contemporary and it contains similar portraits of\r\nSocrates and Plato, Pythagoras, Anaxagoras, and Cicero.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Problem of a spying-tube and Hermann’s relation to the\r\n_Experimentarius_.]\r\n\r\nBoth in the manuscript which we have just been describing and\r\nanother of older date[298] is a picture of two persons seated. In\r\nboth manuscripts one is called Euclid, in the older manuscript only\r\nis the other named, and designated as Hermann. According to Black’s\r\ndescription Euclid “uplifts a sphere with his right hand, and with his\r\nleft holds a telescope through which he is observing the stars; towards\r\nwhom ‘Hermannus,’ on the other side, holds forth a circular instrument\r\nhanging from his fingers, which is superscribed ‘Astrolabium.’” The\r\npicture in the other manuscript is similar, but in view of the fact\r\nthat they were written in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries,\r\nthe rod along which, or tube through which ‘Euclid’ is squinting, can\r\nscarcely be regarded as a telescope without more definite proof of the\r\ninvention of that instrument before the time of Galileo. Perhaps it is\r\na _dioptra_[299] or spying-tube of the sort described by the ancients,\r\nPolybius and Hero, and used in surveying. But I mention the picture\r\nfor the further reason that Clerval[300] asserted a connection between\r\nHermann of Dalmatia, the twelfth century translator, and Bernard\r\nSilvester, affirming that Hermann sent Bernard his work on the uses of\r\nthe astrolabe and that he really translated the _Experimentarius_ from\r\nthe Arabic and sent it to Bernard who merely versified it. But we have\r\nalready proved that it was Hermann the Lame of the eleventh century\r\nwho wrote on the astrolabe and that he did so a century before Bernard\r\nSilvester. The aforesaid picture is clearly of him and not of Hermann\r\nthe Dalmatian. And whether the “B” at whose request Hermann wrote on\r\nthe astrolabe be meant for Berengarius or Bernard, it certainly cannot\r\nbe meant for Bernard Silvester, who was not born yet.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Text of the _Experimentarius_.]\r\n\r\nApparently the text proper of the _Experimentarius_ opens with the\r\nusual instructions of geomancies for the chance casting of points and\r\ndrawing of lines. The number of points left over as a result of this\r\nprocedure is used as a guide in finding the answer to the question\r\nwhich one has in mind. In a preliminary table are listed 28 subjects of\r\ninquiry such as life and death, marriage, imprisonment, enemies, gain.\r\nOne turns to the topic in which one is interested and, according as the\r\nnumber of points obtained by chance is over or under seven, reckons\r\nforward or backward that many times from the number opposite his theme\r\nof inquiry, or, if exactly seven points were left over, takes the\r\nnumber of the theme of inquiry as he finds it. In one manuscript the\r\nnew number thus obtained is that of the “Judge of the Fates” to whom\r\none should next turn. There are 28 such judges, whose names are the\r\nArabic designations for the 28 divisions of the circle of the zodiac\r\nor mansions of the moon, which spends a day in each of them.[301] A\r\npage is devoted to each judge, under whose name are twenty-eight lines\r\ncontaining as many responses to the twenty-eight subjects of inquiry.\r\nThe inquirer selects a line corresponding to his number of points and\r\nthe tables are so arranged that he thus always receives the answer\r\nwhich fits his inquiry. But most of the manuscripts, instead of at\r\nonce referring the inquirer to his Judge as we have described, insert\r\nother preliminary tables in which he is first referred to a planet and\r\nthen to a day of the moon. This unnecessarily indirect and complicated\r\nsystem is probably intended to mystify the reader and to emphasize\r\nfurther the supposedly astrological basis of the procedure, whereas it\r\nis in reality purely a matter of lot-casting.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Two versions of the 28 judges.]\r\n\r\nNow in most of the manuscripts which I have examined there are two\r\nversions of these twenty-eight pages of Judges of the Fates, worded\r\ndifferently, although the corresponding lines always seem to answer the\r\nsame questions and apply to the same topics of inquiry as before. In\r\nthe version which comes first, for example, the first line under the\r\nfirst Judge, _Almazene_ or the belly of Aries, is\r\n\r\n    _Tuum indumentum durabit tempore longo_\r\n\r\nwhile in the second version the same line reads,\r\n\r\n    _Hoc ornamentum decus est et fama ferentum._[302]\r\n\r\nBoth versions seem to be regarded as the _Experimentarius_ of Bernard\r\nSilvester, for in the manuscripts where they occur together the\r\nfirst usually follows its prologue, while the second is preceded by\r\nhis picture and the line, _Translator Bernardus Silvester_.[303]\r\nIn one manuscript[304] the prologue is immediately followed by the\r\nsecond version and the first set of Judges does not occur. In some\r\nmanuscripts,[305] however, the second version occurs without the\r\nfirst and without the prologue, in which cases, I think, there is\r\nnothing to indicate that it is by Bernard Silvester or a part of the\r\n_Experimentarius_. The first version ends in several manuscripts with\r\nthe words, _Explicit libellus de constellationibus_[306] rather than\r\nsome such phrase as _Explicit Experimentarius_. Furthermore in some\r\nmanuscripts where it occurs alone this first set of Judges is called\r\nthe book of Alchandiandus or Alkardianus.[307] He may, however, have\r\nbeen the Arabic author and Bernard his translator, and the _liber\r\nalkardiani phylosophi_ opens in at least one manuscript with words\r\nappropriate to the title, _Experimentarius_, “Since everything that is\r\ntested by experience is experienced either for its own sake or on some\r\nother account.”[308]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Other modes of divination.]\r\n\r\nThere are so many treatises of this type in medieval manuscripts and\r\nthey are so frequently collected in one _codex_ that they are liable\r\nto be confused with one another. Thus in two manuscripts a method of\r\ndivination ascribed to the physician of King Amalricus[309] is in such\r\njuxtaposition to the _Experimentarius_ that Macray takes it to be part\r\nof the _Experimentarius_, while the catalogue of the Sloane Manuscripts\r\ncombines the two as “a compilation ‘concerning the art of Ptolemy.’”\r\nMacray also includes in the _Experimentarius_ a _Praenostica Socratis\r\nBasilei_, which is of frequent occurrence in the manuscripts, and\r\nother treatises on divination which are either anonymous or ascribed\r\nto Pythagoras and, judging from the miniatures prefixed to them, to\r\nAnaxagoras and Cicero, who thus again is appropriately punished for\r\nhaving written a work against divination. I doubt if these other modes\r\nof divination are parts of the _Experimentarius_, which often is found\r\nwithout them, as are some of them without it. But they are so much\r\nlike it in general form and procedure that we may consider them now,\r\nespecially as they are of such dubious date and authorship that it\r\nwould be difficult to place them more exactly.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Divination of the physician of King Amalricus.]\r\n\r\nThe treatise which is assigned to the physician of King Amalricus and\r\nwhich is said to have been composed in memory of that monarch’s great\r\nvictory over the Saracens and Turks in Egypt, obtains its key number\r\nby revolution of a wheel[310] rather than by the geomantic casting\r\nof points, and introduces a trifle more of astrological observance.\r\nIf on first applying the inquirer receives an unfavorable reply, he\r\nmay wait for thirty days and try again, but after the third failure\r\nhe must desist entirely. “It is not allowed to inquire concerning one\r\nthing more than three times.” The twenty-eight subjects of inquiry are\r\ndivided in groups of four among the seven planets, and the inquirer is\r\ntold to return on the weekday named after the planet under which his\r\nquery falls. On the day set the astrologer must further determine with\r\nthe astrolabe when the hour of the same planet has arrived, and not\r\nuntil then may the divination by means of the wheel take place, as a\r\nresult of which the inquirer is directed as before to one of 28 Judges\r\nwho in this case, however, are said to be associated with mansions\r\nof the sun[311] rather than moon. At the close of the treatise of\r\nthe physician of King Amalricus in both manuscripts[312] that I have\r\nexamined is inserted some sceptical person’s opinion to the effect that\r\nthese methods of divination are subtle trifles which are not utterly\r\nuseless as a means of diversion, but that faith should not be placed in\r\nthem. The more apparent the devil’s nets are, concludes the passage,\r\nthe more wary the human bird will be.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Prenostica Socratis Basilei._]\r\n\r\nIn the _Prenostica_ or _Prenosticon Socratis Basilei_--Prognostic of\r\nSocrates the King--a number from one to nine is obtained by chance\r\neither by geomancy or by revolving a wheel on which an image of “King\r\nSocrates” points his finger. The inquirer then consults a table\r\nwhere sixteen questions are so arranged in compartments designated\r\nby letters of the alphabet that each question is found in two\r\ncompartments. Say that the inquirer finds his question in A and E. He\r\nthen consults another table where 144 names of birds, beasts, fish,\r\nstones, herbs, flowers, cities, and other “species” are arranged in\r\nnine rows opposite the numbers from one to nine and in sixteen columns\r\nheaded by the sixteen possible pairs of letters such as the AE of our\r\ninquirer. Looking in the row corresponding to his number and the column\r\nAE he obtains a name. He must then find this name in a series of twelve\r\ncircular tables where the aforesaid names are listed under their proper\r\nspecies, each table containing twelve names. He now is referred on to\r\none of sixteen kings of the Turks, India, Spain, Francia, Babylonia,\r\nthe Saracens, Romania, etc. Under each king nine answers are listed and\r\nhere at last under his original number obtained by lot he finds the\r\nappropriate answer.[313]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Further modes of divination.]\r\n\r\nIn the _Prenostica Pitagorice_ we are assured that we may rest easy as\r\nto the integrity of the Catholic Faith being observed, “for that does\r\nnot happen of necessity which human caution forewarned, can avoid.” It\r\nanswers any one of a list of thirty-six questions by means of a number\r\nobtained by chance between one and twelve. The inquirer is referred\r\nto one of 36 birds whose pictures are drawn in the margins with twelve\r\nlines of answers opposite each bird. Other schemes of divination\r\nfound with the _Experimentarius_ in some manuscripts differ from the\r\nforegoing only in the number of questions concerning which inquiry can\r\nbe made, the number of Judges and the names given them, the number of\r\nlines under each Judge, and the number of intermediate directory tables\r\nthat have to be consulted before the final Judge is reached. As Judges\r\nwe meet the twelve sons of Jacob, the thirty-six decans or thirds of\r\nthe twelve signs, and another astrological group of twenty made up of\r\nthe twelve signs, seven planets, and the dragon.[314]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Experimental character of geomancy.]\r\n\r\nIn one manuscript[315] the directions for consulting this last group\r\nof Judges are given under the heading, _Documentum experimenti\r\nretrogradi_, which like Bernard’s _Experimentarius_ suggests the\r\nexperimental character of the art of geomancy or the arts of divination\r\nin general. Later we shall hear Albertus Magnus in the _Speculum\r\nastronomiae_ call treatises of aerimancy,[316] pyromancy, and\r\nhydromancy, as well as of geomancy “experimental books.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Various other geomancies.]\r\n\r\nGeomancies are of frequent occurrence in libraries of medieval\r\nmanuscripts.[317] Many are anonymous[318] but others bear the names of\r\nnoted men of learning. The art must have had great currency among the\r\nArabs,[319] for not only are treatises current in Latin under such\r\nnames as Abdallah,[320] Albedatus,[321] Alcherius,[322] Alkindi,[323]\r\nand Alpharinus,[324] but almost every prominent translator of the time\r\nseems to have tried his hand at a geomancy. In the manuscripts we find\r\ngeomancies attributed to Gerard of Cremona,[325] Plato of Tivoli,[326]\r\nMichael Scot,[327] Hugo Sanctelliensis,[328] William of Moerbeke,[329]\r\nWilliam de Saliceto of Piacenza,[330] and Peter of Abano,[331] and\r\neven to their medical confrère and contemporary, Bernard Gordon, who\r\nis not usually classed as a translator.[332] Some of these, however,\r\nwere translators from the Greek or the Hebrew rather than Arabic, and\r\nsome of the geomantic treatises in the manuscripts claim an origin from\r\nIndia.[333] But a Robert or Roger Scriptoris who compiled a geomancy\r\ntowards the close of the medieval period thinks first among his sources\r\nof “the Arabs of antiquity and the wise moderns, William of Moerbeke,\r\nBartholomew of Parma, Gerard of Cremona, and many others.”[334] These\r\nother geomancies are not necessarily like the _Experimentarius_ of\r\nBernard Silvester[335] and we shall describe another sort when we come\r\nto speak of Bartholomew of Parma in a later chapter.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Interest of statesmen and clergy in the art.]\r\n\r\nIn the fifteenth century such intellectual statesmen as Humphrey,\r\nDuke of Gloucester, and Henry VII of England displayed an interest\r\nin geomancy, judging from a manuscript _de luxe_ of Guido Bonatti’s\r\nwork on astrology which was made for Henry VII and contains a picture\r\nof him, and also Plato’s translation of the geomancy of Alpharinus\r\nand geomantic “tables of Humphrey, duke of Gloucester.”[336] The\r\ninterest of the clergy in this superstitious art is attested not only\r\nby the translation of such a person as William of Moerbeke, who was\r\npapal penitentiary and later archbishop of Corinth, but by a geomancy\r\nwhich we find in two fifteenth century manuscripts written by Martin,\r\nan abbot of Burgos, at the request of another abbot of Paris.[337]\r\nTreatises on geomancy continue to be found in the manuscripts as late\r\nas the eighteenth century, that of Gerard of Cremona especially.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[261] Clerval, _Les Écoles de Chartres_, Paris, 1895, pp. 158-63. The\r\npoint was for a time contested by Ch. V. Langlois, “Maître Bernard,”\r\nin _Bibl. de l’École des Chartes_, LIV (1893) and by Hauréau. The two\r\nBernards are still identified in EB, 11th edition, while Steinschneider\r\n(1905), p. 8, still identified Bernard of Chartres with the author of\r\n_De mundi universitate_.\r\n\r\n[262] Dr. R. L. Poole, EHR (1920), p. 327, does not regard this as\r\nabsolutely certain but agrees at p. 331 “that the evidence of place\r\nand time make it impossible to identify Bernard Silvester with Bernard\r\nof Chartres,” as he had done earlier in _Illustrations of Medieval\r\nThought_ (1884), pp. 113-26.\r\n\r\n[263] B.

For a summary of the MSS see Appendix I at the close of this\r\nchapter.\r\n\r\n[297] Digby 46, 14th century, fol. 1v, the first line is blue, the next\r\nred, etc.\r\n\r\n_An sors instabilis melius ferat ars docet eius_ _In septem stabis\r\nminus una petens numerabis_ _Post septem sursum numerando perfice\r\ncursum_ _Translator Bernardus Silvester_ _Hic infallibilis liber\r\nincipit autem peius._\r\n\r\nAt fol. 25v, the same five lines except that the last line is put\r\nfirst, where it would seem to belong, and is accordingly colored red\r\ninstead of blue as before, the colors of the other four lines remaining\r\nthe same as before.\r\n\r\n[298] Ashmole 304, 13th century, fol. 2v.\r\n\r\n[299] In this connection the following MS might prove of interest: CU\r\nTrinity 1352, 17th century, neatly written, _Dioptrica Practica_. Fol.\r\n1 is missing and with it the full title. Cap 1, _de Telescopiorum ac\r\nMicroscopium Inventione, diversitate, et varietati. Quaestio I, Quid\r\nsunt Telescopia et quomodo ac quando inventa_. After fol. 90 is a\r\nsingle leaf of diagrams.\r\n\r\n[300] Clerval (1895), pp. 169, 190-91.\r\n\r\n[301] These 28 Judges, or mansions of the moon, are seldom spelled\r\ntwice alike in the MSS, but are somewhat as follows: _Almazene_,\r\n_Anatha_, _Albathon_, _Arthura_, _Adoran_, _Almusan_, _Atha_, _Arian_,\r\n_Anathia_, _Althare_, _Albuza_, _Alcoreten_, _Arpha_, _Alana_,\r\n_Asionet_, _Algaphar_, _Azavenu_, _Alakyal_, _Alcalu_, _Aleum_,\r\n_Avaadh_, _Avelde_, _Cathateue_, _Eadabula_, _Eadatauht_, _Eadalana_,\r\n_Algafalmar_, _Algagafalui_.\r\n\r\n[302] In the MSS, which are very carelessly and often slovenly written,\r\nthe wording of these lines varies a good deal, for instance, in Digby\r\n46, fol. 11r, “Sum (_sic_) monumentum durabit tempore longo,” and in CU\r\nTrinity 1404 (II), fol. 2r, “Hoc ornamentum est et fama parentum.”\r\n\r\n[303] Digby 46, fol. 25v; in Ashmole 304 the corresponding leaf has\r\nbeen cut out, probably for the sake of the miniature; Sloane 3857,\r\nfol. 181v, omits the picture but has the phrase, “Translator Bernardus\r\nSilvester.”\r\n\r\n[304] Sloane 3554, fol. 13v-.\r\n\r\n[305] Ashmole 342, early 14th century, #2.\r\n\r\nAshmole 399, late 13th century, fols. 54-8.\r\n\r\nRoyal 12-C-XII, fols. 108-23.\r\n\r\nCU Trinity 1404 (II), 14-15th century, fols. 2-16.\r\n\r\nSome of these MSS I have not seen.\r\n\r\n[306] Digby 46, fol. 24v; Ashmole 304, fol. 16v; Sloane 3857, fol. 180v.\r\n\r\n[307] Additional 15236, English hand of 13-14th century, fols. 130-52r,\r\n“libellus Alchandiandi”; BN 7486, 14th century, fol. 30v, “Incipit\r\nliber alkardiani phylosophi. Cum omne quod experitur sit experiendum\r\npropter se vel propter aliud....” And see above, the latter pages of\r\nChapter 30.\r\n\r\n[308] See the preceding note.\r\n\r\n[309] Sloane 3554, fol. 1-; Digby 46, fols. 3r-5v, and fol. 90r. But\r\nin both MSS it precedes the prologue of the _Experimentarius_. Macray\r\nwas probably induced to regard everything in Digby 46 up to fol. 92r\r\nas _Experimentarius_ by the picture of Bernard Silvester which occurs\r\nat fol. 1v with the accompanying five lines stating that he is the\r\ntranslator of “this infallible book.” But the picture is probably\r\nmisplaced, since it occurs again at fol. 25v before the second version\r\nof the 28 Judges.\r\n\r\n[310] Inset inside the thick cover of Digby 46 are two interlocking\r\nwooden cogwheels for this purpose, with 28 and 13 teeth respectively.\r\n\r\n[311] In Digby 46 diagrams showing the number of stars in each are\r\ngiven.\r\n\r\n[312] Digby 46, fol. 5v; Sloane 3554, fol. 12r.\r\n\r\n[313] I have described the _Prenostica_ as it is found in Digby 46,\r\nfol. 40r-, with a picture at fol. 41v of Socrates seated and Plato\r\nstanding behind him and pointing. Ashmole 304 has the same text and\r\npicture; and the text is practically the same in Sloane 3857, fols.\r\n196-207, “_Documentum subsequentis considerationis quae Socratica\r\ndicitur_.” In Additional 15236, 13-14th century, fols. 95r-108r,\r\nthe inquirer is first directed to implore divine aid and repeat a\r\nPaternoster and Ave Maria, and some details are slightly different, but\r\nthe general method is identical. The final answers are given in French.\r\nIn BN 7420A, 14th century, fol. 126r- (or clxxxxvi, or col. 451),\r\n“_Liber magni solacii socratis philosophi_” is also essentially the\r\nsame; indeed, its opening words are, “_Pronosticis Socratis basilii_.”\r\nPreceding it are similar methods of divination, beginning at fol. 121v\r\n(or clxxxxii or col. 440), “_Si vis operare de geomancia debes facere\r\nquatuor lineas...._” Evidently the following is also our treatise: CU\r\nTrinity 1404 (IV), 14-15th century, _Iste liber dicitur Rota fortune\r\nin qua sunt 16 questiones determinate in pronosticis sententiat’_.\r\n(sic) _basilici que sub sequentibus inscribuntur et sunt 12 spere et\r\n16 Reges pro iudicibus constituti et habent determinare veritatem de\r\nquestionibus antedictis cum auxilio sortium_. James (III, 423) adds,\r\n“The questions, tables, spheres, and Kings follow....” Our treatise is\r\nalso listed in John Whytefeld’s 1389 catalogue of MSS in Dover Priory,\r\nNo. 409, fol. 192v, _Pronostica socratis phi_.\r\n\r\n[314] These tracts of divination are found in Digby 46, fols. 52r-92r,\r\nand partially in Ashmole 304, Sloane 3857, and Sloane 2472.\r\n\r\n[315] Sloane 2472, fol. 22r.\r\n\r\n[316] The word seems to be regularly so spelled in the middle ages,\r\nalthough modern dictionaries give only aeromancy.\r\n\r\n[317] For instance, at Munich the following MSS are devoted to works of\r\ngeomancy: CLM 192, 196, 240, 242, 276, 392, 398, 421, 436, 456, 458,\r\n483, 489, 541, 547, 588, 671, 677, 905, 11998, 24940, 26061, 26062.\r\n\r\n[318] For instance, Amplon.

He\r\nwrites “The work of Bernard ... corresponds so closely both in form,\r\nin spirit, and sometimes even in phraseology to the _Liber divinorum\r\noperum_ that it appears to us certain that Hildegard must have had\r\naccess to it.”[338] Without subscribing unreservedly to this view,\r\nwe pass on from the Platonist and geomancer of Tours to the Christian\r\n“sibyl of the Rhine.”[339]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Her personality and reputation.]\r\n\r\nFrom repeated statements in the prefaces to Hildegard’s works, in\r\nwhich she tells exactly when she wrote them and how old she was at\r\nthe time,--for not only was she not reticent on this point but her\r\ndifferent statements of her age at different times are all consistent\r\nwith one another--it is evident that she was born in 1098. Her\r\nbirthplace was near Sponheim. From the age of five, she tells us in the\r\n_Scivias_, she had been subject to visions which did not come to her\r\nin her sleep but in her wakeful hours, yet were not seen or heard with\r\nthe eyes and ears of sense. During her lifetime she was also subject\r\nto frequent illness, and very likely there was some connection between\r\nher state of health and her susceptibility to visions. She spent her\r\nlife from her eighth year in religious houses along the Nahe river,\r\nand in 1147 became head of a nunnery at its mouth opposite Bingen, the\r\nplace with which her name was henceforth connected. She became famed\r\nfor her cures of diseases as well as her visions and ascetic life, and\r\nit is Kaiser’s opinion that her medical skill contributed more to her\r\npopular reputation for saintliness than all her writings. At any rate\r\nshe became very well known, and her prayers and predictions were much\r\nsought after. Thomas Becket, who seems to have been rather too inclined\r\nto pry into the future, as we shall see later, wrote asking for “the\r\nvisions and oracles of that sainted and most celebrated Hildegard,”\r\nand inquiring whether any revelation had been vouchsafed her as to\r\nthe duration of the existing papal schism. “For in the days of Pope\r\nEugenius she predicted that not until his last days would he have peace\r\nand grace in the city.”[340] It is very doubtful whether St. Bernard\r\nvisited her monastery and called the attention of Pope Eugenius III\r\nto her visions, but her letters[341] show her in correspondence with\r\nSt. Bernard and several popes and emperors, with numerous archbishops\r\nand bishops, abbots and other potentates, to whom she did not hesitate\r\nto administer reproofs and warnings. For this purpose and to aid in\r\nthe repression of heresy she also made tours from Bingen to various\r\nparts of Germany. There is some disagreement whether she died in 1179\r\nor 1180.[342] Proceedings were instituted by the pope in 1233 to\r\ninvestigate her claims to sainthood, but she seems never to have been\r\nformally canonized. Gebenon, a Cistercian prior in Eberbach, made a\r\ncompendium from her _Scivias_, _Liber divinorum operum_, and _Letters_,\r\n“because few can own or read her works.”[343]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Dates of Hildegard’s works.]\r\n\r\nAs was stated above, we can date some of Hildegard’s works with\r\nexactness. In her preface to the one entitled _Scivias_[344] she says\r\nthat in the year 1141, when she was forty-two years and seven months\r\nold, a voice from heaven bade her commit her visions to writing. She\r\nadds that she scarcely finished the book in ten years, so we infer that\r\nshe was working at it from 1141 to 1150. This fits exactly with what\r\nshe tells us in the preface to the _Liber vitae meritorum_, which she\r\nwas divinely instructed to write in 1158, when she was sixty years old.\r\nMoreover, she says that the eight years preceding, that is from 1151\r\nto 1158, had been spent in writing other treatises which also appear\r\nto have been revealed in visions and among which were “_subtilitates\r\ndiversarum naturarum creaturarum_,” the title of another of her works\r\nwith which we shall be concerned. On the _Liber vitae meritorum_ she\r\nspent five years, so it should have been completed by 1163. In that\r\nyear, the preface to the _Liber divinorum operum_ informs us,--and\r\nthe sixty-fifth year of her life--a voice instructed her to begin\r\nits composition, and seven more years were required to complete it.\r\nThis leaves undated only one of the five works by her which we\r\nshall consider, namely, the _Causae et curae_, or _Liber compositae\r\nmedicinae_ as it is sometimes called, while the _Subtilitates\r\ndiversarum naturarum creaturarum_ bears a corresponding alternative\r\ntitle, _Liber simplicis medicinae_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Question of their genuineness.]\r\n\r\n“Some would impugn the genuineness of all her writings,” says the\r\narticle on Hildegard in _The Catholic Encyclopedia_, “but without\r\nsufficient reason.”[345] Kaiser, who edited the _Causae et curae_,\r\nhad no doubt that both it and the _Subtilitates_ were genuine works.\r\nRecently Singer has excluded them both from his discussion of\r\nHildegard’s scientific views on the ground that they are probably\r\nspurious, but his arguments are unconvincing. His objection that they\r\nare full of German expressions which are absent in her other works is\r\nof little consequence, since it would be natural to employ vernacular\r\nproper names for homely herbs and local fish and birds and common\r\nailments, while in works of an astronomical and theological character\r\nlike her other visions there would be little reason for departing\r\nfrom the Latin. Anyway Hildegard’s own assertion in the preface of\r\nthe _Liber vitae meritorum_ is decisive that she wrote that work.\r\nThe almost contemporary biography of her also states that she wrote\r\n“certain things concerning the nature of man and the elements, and\r\nof diverse creatures,”[346] which may be a blanket reference to the\r\n_Causae et curae_ as well as the _Subtilitates diversarum naturarum\r\ncreaturarum_. The records which we have of the proceedings instituted\r\nby the pope in 1233 to investigate Hildegard’s title to sainthood\r\nmention both the _Liber simplicis medicinae_ and _Liber compositae\r\nmedicinae_ as her works; and later in the same century Matthew of\r\nWestminster ascribed both treatises to her, stating further that the\r\n_Liber simplicis medicinae secundum creationem_ was in eight books and\r\ngiving the full title of the other as _Liber compositae medicinae de\r\naegritudinum causis signis et curis_.[347] Kaiser has pointed out a\r\nnumber of parallel passages in it and the _Subtilitates_, while its\r\nintroductory cosmology seems to me very similar to that of Hildegard’s\r\nother three works. Indeed, as we consider the contents of these five\r\nworks together, it will become evident that the same peculiar views and\r\npersonality run through them all.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Question of Hildegard’s knowledge of Latin.]\r\n\r\nIn the preface to the _Liber vitae meritorum_ Hildegard speaks of\r\na man and a girl who gave her some assistance in writing out her\r\nvisions.[348] From such passages in her own works and from statements\r\nof her biographers and other writers[349] it has been inferred that she\r\nwas untrained in Latin grammar and required literary assistance.[350]\r\nOr sometimes it is said that she miraculously became able to\r\nspeak and write Latin without having ever been instructed in that\r\nlanguage.[351] Certainly the _Causae et curae_ is a lucid, condensed,\r\nand straightforward presentation which it would be very difficult to\r\nsummarize or excerpt. One must read it all, for further condensation\r\nis impossible. One can hardly say as much for her other works, but a\r\nnew critical edition of them such as the _Causae et curae_ has enjoyed\r\nmight result in an improvement of the style. But our concern is rather\r\nwith their subject-matter.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Subject-matter of Hildegard’s works.]\r\n\r\nThree of the five works which we shall consider are written out in\r\nthe form of visions, and are primarily religious in their contents\r\nbut contain considerable cosmology and some human anatomy, as well as\r\nsome allusions to magic and astrology. The other two deal primarily\r\nwith medicine and natural science, and give no internal indication\r\nof having been revealed in visions, presenting their material in\r\nsomewhat didactic manner, and being divided into books and chapters,\r\nlike other medieval treatises on the same subjects. As printed in\r\nMigne, the _Subtleties of Different Natural Creatures_ or _Book of\r\nMedicinal Simples_ is in nine books dealing respectively with plants,\r\nelements, trees, stones, fish, birds, animals, reptiles, and metals.\r\nIn this arrangement there is no plan evident[352] and it would seem\r\nmore logical to have the books on plants and trees and stones and\r\nmetals together. In Schott’s edition of 1533 the discussion of stones\r\nwas omitted--perhaps properly, since Matthew of Westminster spoke of\r\nbut eight books--and the remaining topics were grouped in four books\r\ninstead of eight as in Migne. First came the elements, then metals,\r\nthen a third book treating of plants and trees, and a fourth book\r\nincluding all sorts of animals.[353] That the _Subtleties_ was a widely\r\nread and influential work is indicated by the number of manuscripts of\r\nit listed by Schmelzeis and Kaiser. Of the five books of the _Causae\r\net curae_ the first, beginning with the creation of the universe,\r\nHyle, the creation of the angels, fall of Lucifer, and so forth,\r\ndeals chiefly with celestial phenomena and the waters of the sea and\r\nfirmament. The second combines some discussion of Adam and Eve and the\r\ndeluge with an account of the four elements and humors, human anatomy,\r\nand various other natural phenomena.[354] With book three the listing\r\nof cures begins and German words appear occasionally in the text.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Relations between science and religion in them.]\r\n\r\nSo much attention to the Biblical story of creation and of Adam and Eve\r\nas is shown in the first two books of the _Causae et curae_ might give\r\none the impression that Hildegard’s natural science is highly colored\r\nby and entirely subordinated to a religious point of view. But this is\r\nnot quite the impression that one should take away. A notable thing\r\nabout even her religious visions is the essential conformity of their\r\ncosmology and physiology to the then prevalent theories of natural\r\nscience. The theory of four elements, the hypothesis of concentric\r\nspheres surrounding the earth, the current notions concerning veins and\r\nhumors, are introduced with slight variations in visions supposed to\r\nbe of divine origin. In matters of detail Hildegard may make mistakes,\r\nor at least differ from the then more generally accepted view, and she\r\ndisplays no little originality in giving a new turn to some of the\r\nfamiliar concepts, as in her five powers of fire, four of air, fifteen\r\nof water, and seven of earth.[355] But she does not evolve any really\r\nnew principles of nature. Possibly it is the spiritual application\r\nof these scientific verities that is regarded as the pith of the\r\nrevelation, but Hildegard certainly says that she sees the natural\r\nfacts in her visions. The hypotheses of past and contemporary natural\r\nscience, somewhat obscured or distorted by the figurative and mystical\r\nmode of description proper to visions, are embodied in a saint’s\r\nreveries and utilized in inspired revelation. Science serves religion,\r\nit is true, but religion for its part does not hesitate to accept\r\nscience.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Peculiar views concerning winds and rivers.]\r\n\r\nWe cannot take the time to note all of Hildegard’s minor variations\r\nfrom the natural science of her time, but may note one or two\r\ncharacteristic points in which her views concerning the universe and\r\nnature seem rather daring and unusual, not to say crude and erroneous.\r\nIn the _Scivias_ she represents a blast and lesser winds as emanating\r\nfrom each of four concentric heavens which she depicts as surrounding\r\nthe earth, namely, a sphere of fire, a shadowy sphere like a skin, a\r\nheaven of pure ether, and a region of watery air under it.[356] In the\r\n_Liber divinorum operum_ she speaks of winds which drive the firmament\r\nfrom east to west and the planets from west to east.[357] In the\r\n_Subtilitates_ Hildegard seems to entertain the strange notion that\r\nrivers are sent forth from the sea like the blood in the veins of the\r\nhuman body.[358] One gets the impression that the rivers flow up-hill\r\ntoward their sources, since one reads that “the Rhine is sent forth by\r\nthe force of the sea”[359] and that “some rivers go forth from the sea\r\nimpetuously, others slowly according to the winds.”\r\n\r\nSince Hildegard lived on the Nahe or Rhine all her life she must\r\nindeed have been absorbed in her visions and monastic life not to have\r\nlearned in which direction a river flows; and perhaps we should supply\r\nthe explanation, which she certainly does not expressly give in the\r\n_Subtilitates_, that the sea feeds the rivers by evaporation or through\r\nsubterranean passages. Perhaps a passage in the _Causae et curae_ may\r\nbe taken as a correction or explanation of the preceding assertions,\r\nin which case that work would seem to be of later date than the\r\n_Subtilitates_. In it too Hildegard states that “springs and rivers”\r\nwhich “flow from the sea” are better in the east than in the west,\r\nbut her next sentence straightway adds that they are salt and leave\r\na salt deposit on the sands where they flow which is medicinal.[360]\r\nThe waters rising from the southern sea are also spoken of by her as\r\nsalt.[361] Even in the _Causae et curae_ she speaks of the water of the\r\ngreat sea which surrounds the world as forming a sort of flank to the\r\nwaters above the firmament.[362]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Suggestions concerning drinking-water.]\r\n\r\nOn the subject of whether waters are wholesome to drink or not\r\nHildegard comes a trifle nearer the truth and somewhat reminds us of\r\nthe discussions of the same subject in Pliny and Vitruvius.[363] She\r\nsays that swamp water should always be boiled,[364] that well water is\r\nbetter to drink than spring-water and spring-water than river water,\r\nwhich should be boiled and allowed to cool before drinking;[365]\r\nthat rain-water is inferior to spring-water[366] and that drinking\r\nsnow-water is dangerous to the health.[367] The salt waters of the\r\nwest she regards as too turbid, while the fresh waters of the west are\r\nnot warmed sufficiently by the sun and should be boiled and allowed to\r\ncool before using.[368] The salt waters arising from the south sea are\r\nvenomous from the presence in them of worms and small animals. Southern\r\nfresh waters have been purged by the heat, but make the flesh of men\r\nfatty and of black color.[369] Hildegard is not the first author to\r\nadvise the boiling of drinking-water,[370] but she certainly lays great\r\nstress on this point.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The devil as the negative principle.]\r\n\r\nWhile the scheme of the universe put forward by ancient and medieval\r\nscience is, as we have seen, on the whole adopted even in Hildegard’s\r\nmost visionary writings, it is equally true that the religious interest\r\nis by no means absent from her two works of medicine and natural\r\nhistory. In the first place, the devil is a force in nature which she\r\noften mentions. Her opening the _Causae et curae_ with a discussion\r\nof creation--of course a usual starting-point with the medieval\r\nscientist--soon leads her to speak of the fall of Lucifer. She has a\r\nrather good theory that Lucifer in his perverse will strove to raise\r\nhimself to Nothing, and that since what he wished to do was Nothing,\r\nhe fell into nothingness and could not stand because he could find no\r\nfoundation under him.[371] But after the devil was unable to create\r\nanything out of nothing and fell from heaven, God created the firmament\r\nand sun, moon, and stars to show how great He was and to make the devil\r\nrealize what glory he had lost.[372] Other creatures who willingly\r\njoin themselves to the devil lose their own characteristics and become\r\nnothing.[373] Lucifer himself is not permitted to move from Tartarus\r\nor he would upset the elements and celestial bodies, but a throng\r\nof demons of varying individual strength plot with him against the\r\nuniverse.[374] But in other passages Hildegard seems to admit freely\r\nthe influence, if not the complete presence, of the devil in nature.\r\nAnd he has the power of deceiving by assumed appearances, as Adam was\r\nseduced by the serpent.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Natural substances and evil spirits.]\r\n\r\nIndeed, the dragon to this day hates mankind and has such a nature and\r\nsuch diabolical arts in itself that sometimes when it emits its fiery\r\nbreath, the spirits of the air disturb the air.[375] This illustrates a\r\ncommon feature of Hildegard’s natural history and pharmacy; namely, the\r\nassociation of natural substances with evil spirits either in friendly\r\nor hostile relationships. In the preface to the first book of the\r\n_Subtleties_ she states that some herbs cannot be endured by demons,\r\nwhile there are others of which the devil is fond and to which he joins\r\nhimself. In mandragora, for example, “the influence of the devil is\r\nmore present than in other herbs; consequently man is stimulated by\r\nit according to his desires, whether they be good or bad.”[376] On\r\nthe other hand, the holm-oak is hostile to the spirits of the air;\r\none who sleeps under its shade is free from diabolical illusions, and\r\nfumigating a house with it drives out the evil spirits.[377] Certain\r\nfish, too, have the property of expelling demons, whether one eats\r\nthem or burns their livers or bones.[378] Finally, stones and metals\r\nhave their relations to evil spirits. It is advisable for a woman in\r\nchildbirth to hold the gem jasper in her hand, “in order that malignant\r\nspirits of the air may be the less able to harm her and her child;\r\nfor the tongue of the ancient serpent extends itself towards the\r\nperspiration of the child, as it emerges from the mother’s womb.”[379]\r\nNot only does the touch of red-hot steel weaken the force of poison in\r\nfood or drink, but that metal also signifies the divinity of God, and\r\nthe devil flees from and avoids it.[380]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Stars and fallen angels: sin and nature.]\r\n\r\nIt is perhaps not very surprising that we should find in Hildegard’s\r\nworks notions concerning nature which we met back in the Enoch\r\nliterature, since some of her writings take the same form of recorded\r\nvisions as Enoch’s, while one of them, the _Liber vitae meritorum_,\r\nis equally apocalyptic. At any rate, in the _Scivias_ in the second\r\nvision, where Lucifer is cast out of glory because of his pride, the\r\nfallen angels are seen as a great multitude of stars, as in the _Book\r\nof Enoch_, and we are told that the four elements were in harmony\r\nbefore Lucifer’s fall.[381] The disturbing effect of sin, even human,\r\nupon nature is again stated in the _Causae et curae_, where it is said\r\nthat normally the elements serve man quietly and perform his works. But\r\nwhen men engage in wars and give way to hate and envy, the elements\r\nare apt to rage until men repent and seek after God again.[382] In\r\nthe _Liber vitae meritorum_, too, the elements complain that they are\r\noverturned and upset by human depravity and iniquity.[383]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Nature in Adam’s time: the antediluvian period.]\r\n\r\nThe influence of the Christian religion is further shown and that of\r\nthe Bible in particular is manifested by numerous allusions to Adam\r\nand the earliest period of Biblical history, but very few of them\r\nfind any justification in the scriptural narrative. Thus the _Liber\r\ndivinorum operum_ states[384] that after the fall of Adam and before\r\nthe deluge the sun and moon and planets and other stars were “somewhat\r\nturbulent from excessive heat,” and that the men of that time possessed\r\ngreat bodily strength in order that they might endure this heat. The\r\ndeluge reduced the temperature and men since have been weaker. In the\r\npreface to the fifth book of the _Subtleties_ we are told that there\r\nare certain plants which fish eat, and which, if man could procure and\r\neat, would enable him to go without food for four or five months. Adam\r\nused to eat them at times after he had been cast out of Eden, but not\r\nwhen he could get enough other food, as they make the flesh tough. In\r\nthe preface to the eighth book Hildegard says that all creatures were\r\ngood before Adam’s fall, but when Abel’s blood stained the soil noxious\r\nhumors arose from which venomous and deadly reptiles were generated.\r\nThese perished in the deluge, but others were generated from their\r\nputrefying carcasses. In the _Causae et curae_, too, the names of Adam\r\nand Eve occasionally appear in the chapter headings, for instance, “Of\r\nAdam’s fall and of melancholy.”[385]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Spiritual lessons from natural phenomena.]\r\n\r\nHildegard also held the view, common among medieval Christian writers,\r\nthat one purpose of the natural world about us is to illustrate the\r\nspiritual world and life to come, and that invisible and eternal truths\r\nmay be manifested in visible and temporal objects. In the _Scivias_\r\nshe hears a voice from heaven saying, “God who established all things\r\nby His will, created them to make His Name known and honored, not\r\nonly moreover showing in the same what are visible and temporal, but\r\nalso manifesting in them what are invisible and eternal.”[386] But\r\nneither Hildegard nor medieval Christians in general thought that\r\nthe only purpose of natural phenomena and science was to illustrate\r\nspiritual truth and point a moral. But this always constituted a good\r\nexcuse which sounded well when one of the clergy wished to investigate\r\nor write about things of nature. Not that we mean to question the\r\nsincerity of the medieval writers one whit more than that of certain\r\n“Christian colleges” of the present which deem it wise to demonstrate\r\ntheir piety and orthodoxy by maintaining compulsory chapel attendance\r\nand holding an occasional “Convocation.” But certainly our abbess of\r\nBingen in the course of her writings, especially the _Subtleties_ and\r\n_Causae et curae_, lists many natural phenomena and medical recipes\r\nwithout making any mention of what spiritual truth they may or may not\r\nillustrate.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Hildegard’s attitude toward magic.]\r\n\r\nAssociating natural substances as much with the devil or spirits of the\r\nair as she does, it is not surprising that Hildegard believes in the\r\nreality of magic and has something to say about it. Magic is regarded\r\nby Hildegard as an evil and diabolical art. She describes it in a\r\nvision of the _Scivias_, where God Himself is represented as speaking,\r\nas the art of seeing and hearing the devil, which was taught to men\r\nby Satan himself.[387] Similarly in the _Liber divinorum operum_ it\r\nis stated that Antichrist will excel “in all diabolical arts” and in\r\n“the magic art.”[388] This was of course the usual Christian view.\r\nIn the _Liber vitae meritorum_ with more apparent originality Magic\r\nor _Maleficium_ is presented as one of the personified Vices and is\r\nallowed to speak for itself. It is represented as having the body of a\r\ndog, the head of a wolf, and the tail of a lion. This beast or image\r\nspeaks in its own praise and defense as follows.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Magic Art’s defense.]\r\n\r\n“Of Mercury and other philosophers I will say many things, who by their\r\ninvestigations harnessed the elements in such wise that they discovered\r\nmost certainly everything that they wished. Those very daring and very\r\nwise men learned such things partly from God and partly from evil\r\nspirits. And why shouldn’t they? And they named the planets after\r\nthemselves, since they had made many investigations and learned a great\r\ndeal concerning the sun and moon and stars. I, moreover, rule and reign\r\nwherever I list in those arts, forsooth in the heavenly luminaries,\r\nin trees and herbs and all that grows in the earth, and in beasts and\r\nanimals upon the earth, and in worms both above and below the earth.\r\nAnd on my marches who is there that resists me? God created all things,\r\nso in these arts I do Him no injury. For He wishes it, as is proved in\r\nHis scriptures and perfect works. And what would be the advantage, if\r\nHis works were so blind that no cause could be studied in them? There\r\nwouldn’t be any.”[389]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: True Worship’s reply to Magic.]\r\n\r\nTo this bold attempt of Magic to identify itself with scientific\r\ninvestigation, the True Worship of God responds with the counter\r\nquestion, “Whether it is more pleasing to God to adore Him or His\r\nworks?” and reminds _Maleficium_ that mere creatures which proceed\r\nfrom God can give life to no one and that man is the only rational\r\ncreated being. “You, moreover, O Magic Art, have the circle without\r\nthe center, and while you investigate many problems in the circle of\r\ncreation ... you have robbed God of His very name.” This reply does not\r\nseem to separate magic and scientific investigation or to deny Magic’s\r\nclaim that they are identical, and its force would seem about as cogent\r\nagainst science as against magic. But a little later in the same\r\nwork Hildegard reverts to her former charge that _maleficium_ is “by\r\ndiabolical arts,” and that its devotees “by directing all their works\r\nto impurity turn their science also to the pursuit of evils.” “For they\r\nname demons as their gods and worship them instead of God.”[390]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Magic properties of natural substances.]\r\n\r\nThat magic, however diabolical it may be, does employ natural forces\r\nand substances, is not only asserted by Magic Art itself, but freely\r\nadmitted by Hildegard in her discussions of the properties of animals,\r\nplants, and minerals in her other two works, the _Subtleties of Diverse\r\nCreatures_ and _Cases and Cures_. In the latter work she states that\r\nwhile herbs in the east are full of virtue and have a good odor and\r\nmedicinal properties, those in the west are potent in the magic art\r\nand for other phantasms but do not contribute much to the health of\r\nthe human body.[391] In the former work she tells that the tree-toad\r\nis much employed in diabolical arts, especially when the trees are\r\nbeginning to leaf and blossom, since at this time the spirits of the\r\nair are especially active.[392] Sometimes, however, there is a way to\r\nremove this magic virtue from a natural substance. The root mandragora\r\n“is no longer efficacious for magic and fantastic purposes,” if it is\r\npurified in a fountain for a day and a night immediately after it has\r\nbeen dug from the earth.[393]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Instances of counter-magic.]\r\n\r\nThere are also substances which counteract magic. It has little force\r\nin any place where a fir-tree grows, for the spirits of the air hate\r\nand avoid such spots.[394] In the _Causae et curae_ Hildegard tells how\r\nto compound a powder “against poison and against magic words.”[395] It\r\nalso “confers health and courage and prosperity on him who carries it\r\nwith him.” First one takes a root of geranium (_storkesnabil_) with its\r\nleaves, two mallow plants, and seven shoots of the plantagenet. These\r\nmust be plucked at midday in the middle of April. Then they are to be\r\nlaid on moist earth and sprinkled with water to keep them green for a\r\nwhile. Next they are dried in the setting sun and in the rising sun\r\nuntil the third hour, when they should once more be laid on moist earth\r\nand sprinkled with water until noon. Then they are to be removed and\r\nplaced facing the south in the full sunshine until the ninth hour, when\r\nthey should be wrapped in a cloth, with a stick on top to hold them in\r\nplace, until a trifle before midnight. Then the night begins to incline\r\ntowards day and all the evils of darkness and night begin to flee. A\r\nlittle before midnight, therefore, they should be transferred to a high\r\nwindow or placed above a door or in some garden where the cool air may\r\nhave access to them. As soon as midnight is passed, they are to be\r\nremoved once more, pulverized with the middle finger, and put in a new\r\npill-box with a little _bisemum_ to keep them from decaying but not a\r\nsufficient quantity to overcome the scent of the herbs. A little of\r\nthis powder may be applied daily to the eyes, ears, nose, and mouth, or\r\nit may be bound on the body as an antiaphrodisiac, or it may be held\r\nover wine without touching it but so that its odor can reach the wine,\r\nwhich should then be drunk with a bit of saffron as a preventive of\r\nindigestion, poison, magic, and so forth.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ceremony with a jacinth and wheaten loaf.]\r\n\r\nIn the _Subtilitates_[396] the following procedure is recommended, if\r\nanyone is bewitched by phantasms or magic words so that he goes mad.\r\nTake a wheaten loaf and cut the upper crust in the form of a cross.\r\nFirst draw a jacinth through one line of the cross, saying, “May God\r\nwho cast away all the preciousness of gems from the devil when he\r\ntransgressed His precept, remove from you N. all phantasms and magic\r\nwords and free you from the ill of this madness.” Then the jacinth is\r\nto be drawn through the other arm of the cross and this formula is to\r\nbe repeated, “As the splendor which the devil once possessed departed\r\nfrom him because of his transgression, so may this madness which\r\nharasses N. by varied phantasies and magic arts be removed from you\r\nand depart from you.” The ceremony is then completed by the bewitched\r\nperson eating the bread around the cross.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Hildegard’s superstitious procedure.]\r\n\r\nThese two illustrations make it apparent that Hildegard has a licit\r\nmagic of her own which is every whit as superstitious as the magic art\r\nwhich she condemns. It is evident that she accepts not only marvelous\r\nand occult virtues of natural substances such as herbs and gems, but\r\nalso the power of words and incantations, and rites and ceremonies of a\r\nmost decidedly magical character. In the second passage this procedure\r\nassumed a Christian character, but the plucking and drying of the\r\nherbs in the first passage perhaps preserves the flavor of primitive\r\nTeutonic or Celtic paganism. Nor is such superstitious procedure\r\nresorted to merely against magic, to whose operations it forms a sort\r\nof homeopathic counterpart. It is also employed for ordinary medicinal\r\npurposes, and is a characteristic feature of Hildegard’s conception of\r\nnature and whole mental attitude. This we may further illustrate by\r\nrunning through the books of the _Subtilitates_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Use of herbs.]\r\n\r\nExcept for passages connecting the devil with certain herbs which\r\nwe have already noted, Hildegard’s discussion of vegetation is for\r\nthe most part limited to medicinal properties of herbs, which are\r\neffective without the addition of fantastic ceremonial. Sometimes\r\nnevertheless the herbs are either prepared or administered in a rather\r\nbizarre fashion. Insanity may be alleviated, we are told, by shaving\r\nthe patient’s head and washing it in the hot water in which _agrimonia_\r\nhas been boiled, while the hot herbs themselves are bound in a cloth\r\nfirst over his heart and then upon his forehead and temples.[397] An\r\nunguent beneficial alike for digestive and mental disorders is made of\r\nthe bark, leaves, and bits of the green wood of the fir-tree, combined\r\nwith saliva to half their weight. This mess is to be boiled in water\r\nuntil it becomes thick, then butter is to be added, and the whole\r\nstrained through a cloth.[398] The mandragora root should first be worn\r\nbound between the breast and navel for three days and three nights,\r\nthen divided in halves and these bound on the thighs for three days\r\nand three nights. Finally the left half of the root, which resembles\r\nthe human figure, should be pulverized, camphor added to it, and\r\neaten.[399] If a man is always sad and in the dumps, after purifying\r\nthe mandragora root in a fountain, let him take it to bed with him,\r\nhold it so that it will be warmed by the heat of his body, and say,\r\n“God, who madest man from the dust of the earth without grief, I now\r\nplace next me that earth which has never transgressed”--Hildegard has\r\nalready stated that the mandragora is composed “of that earth of which\r\nAdam was created”--“in order that my clay may feel that peace just as\r\nThou didst create it.” That the prayer or incantation is more essential\r\nthan the virtue of the mandragora in this operation, is indicated by\r\nthe statement that shoots of beech, cedar, or aspen may be used instead\r\nof the mandragora.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Marvelous virtues of gems.]\r\n\r\nOther marvelous effects than routing the devil, which Hildegard\r\nattributes to gems in the course of the fourth book of the\r\n_Subtilitates_, are to confer intellect and science for the day, to\r\nbanish anger and dulness, bestow an equable temper, restrain lust,\r\ncure all sorts of diseases and infirmities, endow with the gift of\r\nsound speech, prevent thefts at night, and enable one to fast. These\r\nmarvelous results are produced either by merely having the stone in\r\none’s possession, or by holding it in the hand, placing it next the\r\nskin, taking it to bed with one and warming it by the heat of the body,\r\nbreathing on it, holding it in the mouth especially when fasting,\r\nsuspending it about the neck, or making the sign of the cross with\r\nit. In the cure of insanity by use of the magnet the stone should be\r\nmoistened with the patient’s saliva and drawn across his forehead\r\nwhile an incantation is repeated.[400] A man may be brought out of\r\nan epileptic fit by putting an emerald in his mouth.[401] Having\r\nrecovered, he should remove the gem from his mouth and say, “As the\r\nspirit of the Lord filled the earth, so may His grace fill the temple\r\nof my body that it may never be moved.” This ceremony is to be repeated\r\non nine successive mornings, and that here the gem is as important\r\nas the prayer is indicated by the direction that the patient should\r\nhave the gem with him each time and take it out and look at it as he\r\nrepeats the incantation. Different is the procedure for curing epilepsy\r\nby means of the gem _achates_.[402] In this case the stone should be\r\nsoaked in water for three days at the full moon; this water should\r\nbe slightly warmed, and then preserved, and all the patient’s food\r\ncooked in it _dum luna tota crescat_. The gem should also be placed\r\nin everything that he drinks. This astrological procedure is to be\r\nrepeated for ten months.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Remarkable properties of fish.]\r\n\r\nWe have already heard that certain fish have the property of expelling\r\ndemons. Fish also have other remarkable virtues. The eye of a\r\n_copprea_, worn in a gold or silver ring so that it touches one’s\r\nfinger, arouses a sluggish intellect.[403] The lung of a tunny fish,\r\ntaken in water, is good for a fever, and it keeps one in good health\r\nto wear shoes and a belt made of its skin.[404] Pulverized salmon\r\nbones are recommended for bad teeth.[405] But eating the head of a\r\n_barbo_ gives one a headache and fever.[406] Hildegard also tells some\r\nwonderful stories concerning the modes of generation of different\r\nvarieties of fish. In the _Causae et curae_[407] for dimness of the\r\neyes it is recommended to dry some walrus skin in the sun, soften it in\r\npure wine, and apply it in a cloth between the eyes at night. It should\r\nbe removed at midnight and applied only on alternate nights for a week.\r\n“Either it will remove dimness of the eyes, or God does not permit this\r\nto be done.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Use of the parts of birds.]\r\n\r\nTo render available or to enhance the occult virtues of birds Hildegard\r\nsuggests a great amount of complicated ceremonial. The heart of a\r\nvulture, split in two, dried before a slow fire and in the sun, and\r\nworn sewn up in a belt of doeskin, makes one tremble in the presence\r\nof poison.[408] This is explained by the vulture’s own antipathy\r\nto poison, which is increased and purified by the fire, sun, and\r\nespecially by the belt, for the doe is swifter and more sensitive\r\nthan other animals. Mistiness is marvelously removed from the eyes\r\nby catching a nightingale before day-break, adding a single drop of\r\ndew found on clean grass to its gall, and anointing the eyebrows\r\nand lashes frequently with the same.[409] Another eye-cure consists\r\nin cooking a heron’s head in water, removing its eyes, alternately\r\ndrying them in the sun and softening them in cold water for three\r\nsuccessive times, pulverizing and dissolving them in wine, and at\r\nnight frequently touching the eyes and lids with the tip of a feather\r\ndipped in this concoction.[410] The blood of a crane, dried and\r\npreserved, and its right foot are employed in varied ways to facilitate\r\nchild-birth.[411] Hildegard also often tells how to make a medicinal\r\nunguent by cooking some bird in some prescribed manner and then\r\npulverizing certain portions of the carcass with various herbs or other\r\nanimal substances.[412] Even without the employment of ceremonial\r\nsufficiently remarkable powers are attributed to the bodies or parts\r\nof birds. Eating the flesh of one reduces fat and benefits epileptics,\r\nwhile eating its liver is good for melancholy.[413] The liver of a\r\nswan has the different property of purifying the lungs, while the lung\r\nof a swan is a cure for the spleen.[414] Again, a heron’s liver cures\r\nstomach trouble, while a cure for spleen is to drink water in which its\r\nbones have been stewed, and if one who is sad eats its heart, it will\r\nmake him glad.[415]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Cures from quadrupeds.]\r\n\r\nHildegard’s chapters on quadrupeds are so delightfully quaint that I\r\ncannot pass them over, although the properties which she attributes\r\nto them and the methods by which their virtues are utilized are not\r\nessentially different from those in examples already given. The camel,\r\nhowever, is peculiar in that its different humps have quite different\r\nvirtues.[416] The one next to its neck has the virtues of the lion; the\r\nsecond, those of the leopard; the third, those of the horse. A cap of\r\nlion’s skin cures ailments of the head whether physical or mental.[417]\r\nDeafness may be remedied by cutting off a lion’s right ear and holding\r\nit over the patient’s ear just long enough to warm it and to say, “Hear\r\n_adimacus_ by the living God and the keen virtue of a lion’s hearing.”\r\nThis process is to be repeated many times. The heart of a lion is\r\nsomewhat similarly employed, but without any incantation, to make a\r\nstupid person prudent. Burying a lion’s heart in the house is regarded\r\nas fire insurance against its being struck by lightning, “for the lion\r\nis accustomed to roar when he hears thunder.” Digestion is aided by\r\ndrinking water in which the dried liver of a lion has been left for\r\na short time. Placing a bit of the skin from between a bear’s eyes\r\nover one’s heart removes timidity and anxiety.[418] If anyone suffers\r\nfrom paralysis or one of those changeable diseases which wax and wane\r\nwith the moon like lunacy, let him select a spot where an ass has been\r\nslain, or has died a natural death, or has wallowed, and let him\r\nspread a cloth on the grass or ground and repose there a short time and\r\nsleep if he can. Afterwards you should take him by the right hand and\r\nsay, “Lazarus slept and rested and rose again; and as Christ roused\r\nhim from foul decay, so may you rise from this perilous pestilence\r\nand the changing phases of fever in that conjunction in which Christ\r\napplied Himself to the alleviation of such complaints, prefiguring\r\nthat He would redeem man from his sins and raise him from the dead.”\r\nWith a brief interval of time allowed between, the same performance\r\nis to be repeated thrice in the same place on the same day, and then\r\nagain thrice on the next and the third days, when the patient will be\r\ncured.[419]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The unicorn, weasel, and mouse.]\r\n\r\nThe liver and skin of the unicorn have great medicinal virtues, but\r\nthat animal can never be caught except by means of girls, for it flees\r\nfrom men but stops to gaze diligently at girls, because it marvels\r\nthat they have human forms, yet no beards. “And if there are two or\r\nthree girls together, it marvels so much the more and is the more\r\nquickly captured while its eyes are fixed on them. Moreover, the girls\r\nemployed in capturing it should be of noble, not peasant birth, and\r\nof the middle period of adolescence.”[420] When one weasel is sick,\r\nanother digs up a certain herb and breathes and urinates on it for an\r\nhour, and then brings it to the sick weasel who is cured by it.[421]\r\nBut what this herb is is unknown to men and other animals, and it would\r\ndo them no good if they did know it, since its unaided virtue is not\r\nefficacious, nor would the action of their breath or urine make it\r\nso. But the heart of a weasel, dried and placed with wax in the ear,\r\nbenefits headache or deafness, and the head of a weasel, worn in two\r\npieces in a belt next the skin, strengthens and comforts the bearer and\r\nkeeps him from harm. The mouse, besides being responsible for two other\r\nequally marvelous cures, is a remedy for epilepsy. “For inasmuch as the\r\nmouse runs away from everything, therefore it drives away the falling\r\ndisease.”[422] It should be put in a dish of water, and the patient\r\nshould drink some of this water and also wash his feet and forehead in\r\nit.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: What animals to eat and wear.]\r\n\r\nHildegard gives some strange advice what animal products to eat and\r\nwear. “Sheepskins are good for human wear, because they do not induce\r\npride or lust or pestilence as the skins of certain other animals\r\ndo.”[423] Pork is not good for either sick or healthy persons to eat,\r\nin her opinion, while beef, on account of its intrinsic cold, is not\r\ngood for a man of cold constitution to eat.[424] On the other hand, she\r\nrecommends as edible various birds which would strike the modern reader\r\nas disgusting.[425]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Insects and reptiles.]\r\n\r\nFleas remain underground in winter but come forth to plague mankind\r\nwhen the sun dries the soil in summer. But one may be rid of them by\r\nheating some earth until it is quite dry and then scattering it upon\r\nthe bed.[426] Hildegard also describes a complicated cure for leprosy\r\nby use of the earth from an ant-hill.[427] If a man kills a certain\r\nvenomous snake just after it has skinned itself in the cleft of a rock,\r\nand cautiously removes its heart and dries the same in the sun, and\r\nthen preserves it in a thin metal cover, it will serve as an amulet.\r\nHolding it in his hand will render him immune to venom and cheer him up\r\nif he becomes gloomy or sorrowful.[428]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Animal compounds.]\r\n\r\nIn the _Causae et curae_ Hildegard combines the virtues of parts of a\r\nnumber of animals into one composite medicine for epilepsy.[429] Four\r\nparts of dried mole’s blood are used because the mole sometimes shows\r\nhimself and sometimes hides, like the epilepsy itself. Two parts of\r\npowdered duck’s bill are added because the duck’s strength is in its\r\nbeak, “and because it touches both pure and impure things with its\r\nbill, it is repugnant to this disease which is sudden and silent.” One\r\nportion of the powdered claws of a goose, minus the skin and flesh, is\r\nadded for much the same reason, and the claw of a goose rather than a\r\ngander is required because the female bird is the more silent of the\r\ntwo. These constituents are bound together in a cloth, placed for three\r\ndays near a recent molecast,--for such earth is more wholesome, then\r\nare put near ice to cool and then in the sun to dry. Cakes are then to\r\nbe made with this powder and the livers of some edible animal and bird\r\nand a little meal and cummin seed, and eaten for five days. Against\r\ndiabolical phantasms is recommended a belt made of the skin of a\r\nroebuck, which is a pure animal, and of the skin of the _helun_, which\r\nis a brave beast, and hence both are abhorred by evil spirits.[430]\r\nThe two strips of skin are to be fastened together by four little\r\nsteel[431] nails, and as each is clasped one repeats the formula, “In\r\nthe most potent strength of almighty God I adjure you to safeguard me”;\r\nonly in the second, third, and fourth instance instead of saying “I\r\nadjure” (_adiuro_), the words _benedico_, _constituo_, and _confirmo_\r\nare respectively substituted. One should be girded with this belt night\r\nand day, and magic words will not harm one.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Magic and astrology closely connected.]\r\n\r\nWe have already encountered more than one instance of observance of\r\nthe phases of the moon in Hildegard’s medicinal and magical procedure,\r\nand have met in one of her formulae a hint that Christ employed\r\nastrological election of a favorable conjunction in performing His\r\nmiracles. Thus as usual the influence of the stars is difficult to\r\nseparate from other occult virtues of natural substances, and we may\r\ncomplete our survey of Hildegard’s writings by considering her views\r\nconcerning the celestial bodies and divination of the future.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Astrology and divination condemned.]\r\n\r\nIn the passage of the _Scivias_ to which we have already referred God\r\ncondemned astrology and divination as well as magic.[432] _Mathematici_\r\nare called “deadly instructors and followers of the Gentiles in\r\nunbelief,” and man is reproved for believing that the stars allot\r\nhis years of life and regulate all human actions, and for cultivating\r\nin the place of his Creator mere creatures such as the stars and\r\nheavens, which cannot console or help him, or confer either prosperity\r\nor happiness. Man should not consult the stars as to the length of\r\nhis life, which he can neither know beforehand nor alter. He should\r\nnot seek signs of the future in either stars or fire or birds or any\r\nother creature. “The error of augury” is expressly rebuked. Man should\r\nabstain not only from worshiping or invoking the devil but from making\r\nany inquiries from him, “since if you wish to know more than you\r\nshould, you will be deceived by the old seducer.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Signs in the stars.]\r\n\r\nIt is true that sometimes by divine permission the stars are signs to\r\nmen, for the Son of God Himself says in the Gospel by Luke that “There\r\nshall be signs in the sun and moon and stars,” and His incarnation was\r\nrevealed by a star. But it is a stupid popular error to suppose that\r\nother men each have a star of their own, and, continues God, speaking\r\nthrough the medium of Hildegard, “That star brought no aid to My Son\r\nother than that it faithfully announced His incarnation to the people,\r\nsince all stars and creatures fear Me and simply fulfill My dictates\r\nand have no signification of anything in any creature.” This last\r\nobservation receives further interpretation in a passage of the _Causae\r\net Curae_[433] which explains that the stars sometimes show many signs,\r\nbut not of the future or hidden thoughts of men, but of matters which\r\nthey have already revealed by act of will or voice or deed, so that the\r\nair has received an impression of it which the stars can reflect back\r\nto other men if God allows it. But the sun and moon and planets do not\r\nalways thus portray the works of men, but only rarely, and in the case\r\nof some great event affecting the public welfare.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Superiors and inferiors; effect of stars and winds on\r\nelements and humors.]\r\n\r\nIf the stars do not even signify the fate and future of man, they\r\nare none the less potent forces and, under God, causes in the world\r\nof nature. “God who created all things,” writes Hildegard in the\r\n_Liber divinorum operum_,[434] “so constituted superiors that He also\r\nstrengthens and purifies things below through these, and in the human\r\nform introduces also those things allotted for the soul’s salvation.”\r\nThis passage has two sides; it affirms the rule of superiors over\r\ninferiors, but it makes special provision for the salvation of the\r\nhuman soul. And thus it is a good brief summary of Hildegard’s\r\nposition. Sun, moon, and stars are represented as by the will of God\r\ncooperating with the winds--which play an important part in Hildegard’s\r\ncosmology--in driving the elements to and fro;[435] and the humors in\r\nthe human body now rage fiercely like the leopard, now move sluggishly\r\nlike the crab, now proceed in other ways analogous to the wolf or deer\r\nor bear or serpent or lamb or lion--animals whose heads, belching\r\nforth winds, are seen in the vision about the rim of the heavenly\r\nspheres.[436] They suggest the influence of the signs of the zodiac,\r\nalthough there appears to be no exact correspondence to these in\r\nHildegard’s visionary scheme of the universe as detailed in the _Liber\r\ndivinorum operum_. In the _Causae et curae_, on the other hand, she\r\ngives a detailed account of how pairs or triplets of planets accompany\r\nthe sun through each of the twelve signs.[437] In other passages[438]\r\nshe affirms that the sun and moon serve man by divine order, and bring\r\nhim strength or weakness according to the temper of the air.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Influence of the moon on human health and generation.]\r\n\r\nHildegard more especially emphasizes the influence of the moon, in\r\nwhich respect she resembles many an astrologer. In the _Causae et\r\ncurae_[439] she states that some days of the moon are good, others\r\nbad; some, useful and others, useless; some, strong and others, weak.\r\n“And since the moon has this changeability in itself, therefore the\r\nmoisture in man has its vicissitudes and mutability in pain, in labor,\r\nin wisdom, and in prosperity.” Similarly in the _Liber divinorum\r\noperum_[440] it is noted that human blood and brain are augmented when\r\nthe moon is full and diminish as it wanes, and that these changes\r\naffect human health variously. Sometimes one incurs epilepsy when\r\nthe moon is in eclipse.[441] The moon is the mother of all seasons.\r\nHildegard marvels in the _Causae et curae_[442] that while men have\r\nsense enough not to sow crops in mid-summer or the coldest part of\r\nwinter, they persist in begetting offspring at any time according to\r\ntheir pleasure without regard either to the proper period of their\r\nown lives or to the time of the moon. The natural consequence of\r\ntheir heedlessness is the birth of defective children. Hildegard then\r\nadds[443] by way of qualification that the time of the moon does not\r\ndominate the nature of man as if it were his god, or as if man received\r\nany power of nature from it, or as if it conferred any part of human\r\nnature. The moon simply affects the air, and the air affects man’s\r\nblood and the humors of his body.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Relations of the four humors to human character and fate.]\r\n\r\nHildegard, however, not only believed that as the humors were perturbed\r\nand the veins boiled, the health of the body would be affected and\r\nperhaps a fever set in,[444] but also that passions, such as wrath\r\nand petulance, were thereby aroused and the mind affected.[445] This\r\nis suggested in a general way in the _Liber divinorum operum_, but is\r\nbrought out in more detail in the _Causae et curae_, where various\r\ntypes of men are delineated according to the combinations of humors in\r\ntheir bodies, and their characters are sketched and even their fate to\r\nsome extent predicted therefrom. In one case[446] “the man will be a\r\ngood scholar, but headlong and too vehement in his studies, so that he\r\nscatters his knowledge over too wide a field, as straw is blown by the\r\nwind; and he seeks to have dominion over others. In body he is healthy\r\nexcept that his legs are weak and he is prone to gout; but he can\r\nlive a long while, if it so please God.” Such a passage hardly sounds\r\nconsistent with Hildegard’s statement elsewhere already noted that man\r\ncannot know the length of his life beforehand. In the case of choleric,\r\nsanguine, melancholy, and phlegmatic men[447] Hildegard states what\r\nthe relations of each type will be with women and even to some extent\r\nwhat sort of children they will have. She also discusses four types of\r\nwomen in very similar style.[448] These are not exactly astrological\r\npredictions, but they have much the same flavor and seem to leave\r\nlittle place for freedom of the will.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Hildegard’s varying position.]\r\n\r\nIn one passage, however, Hildegard comfortingly adds that nevertheless\r\nthe Holy Spirit can penetrate the whole nature of man and overcome his\r\nmutable nature as the sun dispels clouds, and so counteract the moist\r\ninfluence of the moon. She also states concerning the significations\r\nof the stars concerning man’s future, “These significations are not\r\nproduced by the virtue of the planets themselves alone or stars or\r\nclouds, but by the permission and will and decree of God, according as\r\nGod wished to demonstrate to men the works of the same, just as a coin\r\nshows the image of its lord.”[449] In another passage, on the other\r\nhand, Hildegard recognizes, like Aquinas later, that it is only rarely\r\nand with difficulty that the flesh can be restrained from sinning.[450]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Nativities for the days of the moon.]\r\n\r\nFinally, the _Causae et curae_ close with predictions for each day of\r\nthe moon of the type of male or female who will be conceived on that\r\nday.[451] Selecting the eighteenth day by lot as an example of the\r\nothers, we read that a male conceived then will be a thief and will be\r\ncaught in the act and will be deprived of his landed property so that\r\nhe possesses neither fields nor vineyards, but strives to take from\r\nothers what is not his. He will be healthy in body and live a long\r\nlife, if left to himself. A woman conceived on that day will be cunning\r\nand deceitful of speech and will lead upright men to death if she can.\r\nShe too will be sound of body and naturally long-lived, but sometimes\r\ninsane. Hildegard then seems to feel it advisable to add, “But such\r\nmorals, both in men and in women, are hateful to God.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Man the microcosm.]\r\n\r\nThe theory of macrocosm and microcosm had a considerable attraction\r\nfor Hildegard. At the beginning of the _Causae et curae_ she exclaims,\r\n“O man, look at man! For man has in himself heavens and earth ...\r\nand in him all things are latent.”[452] Presently she compares the\r\nfirmament to man’s head, sun, moon, and stars to the eyes, air to\r\nhearing, the winds to smelling, dew to taste, and “the sides of the\r\nworld” to the arms and sense of touch. The earth is like the heart, and\r\nother creatures in the world are like the belly.[453] In the _Liber\r\ndivinorum operum_ she goes into further detail. Between the divine\r\nimage in human form which she sees in her visions and the wheel or\r\nsphere of the universe she notes such relationships as these. The sun\r\nspreads its rays from the brain to the heel, and the moon directs its\r\nrays from the eyebrows to the ankles.[454] Elsewhere she says, “The\r\neyebrows of man declare the journeyings of the moon, namely, the one\r\nroute by which it approaches the sun in order to restore itself, and\r\nthe other by which it recedes after it has been burnt by the sun.”[455]\r\nAgain, from the top of the cerebral cavity to “the last extremity of\r\nthe forehead” there are seven distinct and equal spaces, by which are\r\nsignified the seven planets which are equidistant from one another\r\nin the firmament.[456] An even more surprising assumption as to\r\nastronomical distances is involved in the comparison[457] that as the\r\nthree intervals between the top of the human head and the end of the\r\nthroat and the navel and the groin are all equal, so are the spaces\r\nintervening between the highest firmament and lowest clouds and the\r\nearth’s surface and center. Corresponding to these intervals Hildegard\r\nnotes three ages of man, infancy, adolescence, and old age. One more\r\npassage may be noted, since it also involves a similar explanation\r\nof weeping for joy to that given by Adelard of Bath. As the heart is\r\nstirred by emotion, whether of joy or of sorrow, humors are excited in\r\nthe lungs and breast which rise to the brain and are emitted through\r\nthe eyes in the form of tears. And in like manner, when the moon begins\r\nto wax or wane, the firmament is disturbed by winds which raise fogs\r\nfrom the sea and other waters.[458]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Divination in dreams.]\r\n\r\nIf Hildegard resorts to a magic of her own in order to counteract the\r\ndiabolical arts, and if she accepts a certain amount of astrological\r\ndoctrine for all her censure of it, it is not surprising to find her\r\nin the _Causae et curae_ saying a word in favor of natural divination\r\nin dreams despite her rejection of augury and such arts. She believes\r\nthat, when God sent sleep to Adam before he had yet sinned, his soul\r\nsaw many things in true prophecy, and that the human soul may still\r\nsometimes do the same, although too often it is clouded by diabolical\r\nillusions.[459] But when the body is in a temperate condition and the\r\nmarrow warmed in due measure, and there is no disturbance of vices or\r\ncontrariety of morals, then very often a sleeper sees true dreams.[460]\r\nHildegard’s own visions, as we have seen, came to her in her waking\r\nhours.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[338] Singer (1917) p. 19.\r\n\r\n[339] Migne, _Patrologia Latina_, vol. 197.

A note, however, in Bostock\r\nand Riley’s translation of the _Natural History_ states that Galen\r\nascribed the practice to Hippocrates and that Aristotle was undoubtedly\r\nacquainted with it. When Pliny goes on to say, “Indeed, it is generally\r\nadmitted that all water is more wholesome when it has been boiled,”\r\nanother translator’s note adds, “This is not at all the opinion at the\r\npresent day,” that is, 1856.

This valuable picture of\r\neducational conditions in the middle of the twelfth century has already\r\nsupplied us with a number of bits of information concerning authors of\r\nwhom we have treated. Its importance in the history of the study of\r\nthe classics and of scholasticism has long been recognized, and its\r\ncontent has often been reproduced in secondary works, so that we need\r\nnot dwell upon it specifically here.[462] Moreover, although John spent\r\nsome twelve years in his studies in France, he appears from his own\r\nstatements to have passed from the study of logic and “grammar” to that\r\nof theology without devoting much attention to natural science,[463]\r\nalthough he received some instruction in the Quadrivium from Richard\r\nBishop and Hardewin the Teuton. He was, it is true, according to his\r\nown statement, a pupil of William of Conches for three years, but he\r\nalways alludes to William as a grammarian, not as a writer on natural\r\nphilosophy and astronomy. This one-sided description of William’s\r\nteaching warns us not to place too implicit faith in John’s account of\r\nthe learned world of his times. Even if reliable as it stands, it is\r\nnot in itself a complete or adequate picture. In the _Polycraticus_,\r\nhowever, he engages in a rather long discussion of magic, astrology and\r\nother forms of divination which it behooves us to note.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Chief events of his life.]\r\n\r\nJohn tells us that he was a mere lad when in 1136 he first came from\r\nEngland to Gaul to hear the famous Abelard lecture. Like many medieval\r\nstudents, he was or soon came to be in a needy condition and eked out a\r\nliving at one time by tutoring the sons of nobles. During the time that\r\nhad elapsed between his long training in the liberal arts and theology\r\nand his writing of the _Metalogicus_ in 1159, he had led a busy life\r\nin the employ of Theobald, archbishop of Canterbury, crossing the Alps\r\nten times, journeying twice all the way from England to Apulia, and\r\nfrequently traveling about England and what is now France (John says,\r\n“the Gauls”--_Gallias_). In 1159 he addressed the _Polycraticus_ to\r\nThomas Becket, then absent with Henry II as his chancellor at the siege\r\nof Toulouse. Thomas was just about John’s age and, before he became\r\nchancellor in 1154 at the age of thirty-six, had been like John first\r\na student and then in the employ of Archbishop Theobald. John sided\r\nwith Thomas Becket in the struggle with Henry II, retired to France,\r\nand returned to England with him in 1170. In 1176 he crowned his career\r\nby becoming bishop of Chartres where perhaps some years of his early\r\nstudies had been spent. His death was in 1180.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: General character of the _Polycraticus_.]\r\n\r\nIn the _Metalogicus_ John tells us that he has scarcely touched a book\r\nof logic since he left the _palaestra_ of the dialecticians so many\r\nyears ago, but he returns to the subject again in that work. In the\r\n_Polycraticus_ his literary tastes and interests are more manifest. He\r\nwrites a good Latin style and shows a wide acquaintance with classical\r\nauthors and ancient history as well as with patristic literature.\r\nThe character and content of the _Polycraticus_ is more clearly\r\nsuggested by its sub-title, “Courtiers’ Trifles and Philosophers’\r\nFootprints” (_De nugis curialium et vestigiis philosophorum_). In part\r\nit is satirical, although there is considerable serious discussion\r\nof the state and philosophy and much moralizing for the benefit of\r\ncontemporary courts and statesmen. John confesses that the entire work\r\nis little more than a patch-work of other men’s opinions, sometimes\r\nwithout specific acknowledgment of the authorities. He professes to\r\nbelieve that Thomas will recognize the sources of these passages\r\nwithout being told, while other readers who are more ignorant will be\r\nthereby spurred on to wider reading. These quotations, moreover, are\r\neither from ancient classical or comparatively early Christian writers.\r\nJohn does not epitomize recent literature and thought, although he\r\nmakes application of the thought of the past to contemporary society\r\nand politics, and although he shows some acquaintance with the works\r\nof contemporary writers such as Bernard Silvester. In the main his\r\nattitude is essentially conservative; he repeats traditional views in\r\nan attractive but somewhat dilettante literary form, with such rational\r\ncriticism as a study of the classics might be expected to produce when\r\nqualified by scrupulous adherence to medieval Christian dogma. This is\r\nespecially true of his discussion of the magic arts and astrology.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Magic, _maleficia_, and _mathematica_.]\r\n\r\nJohn begins to discuss magic in the first of the eight books of the\r\n_Polycraticus_ after a few chapters have been taken up with such other\r\ntriflings of courtiers as hunting, dicing, music, and theatrical\r\nshows and spectacles. More harmful than the illusions of the stage, he\r\ndeclares, are those of the magic arts and various kinds of disreputable\r\n_mathematica_, long since forbidden by the holy fathers who knew\r\nthat all these _artificia_, or rather _maleficia_ arose from a fatal\r\nfamiliarity of men and demons.[464] John thus takes as practically\r\nsynonymous the three terms, _magica_, _mathematica_ and _maleficium_.\r\nHe presently explains that the word _mathesis_ in one sense denotes\r\nlearning in general, but that when it has a long penultima, it\r\nsignifies the figments of divination,[465] which belong under magic,\r\nwhose varieties are many and diverse. Thus magic is John’s most general\r\nand inclusive term for all occult arts.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Use of Isidore on magic.]\r\n\r\nThe account of magic in John’s ninth, tenth, eleventh, and twelfth\r\nchapters is largely derived without acknowledgment from that of\r\nIsidore of Seville.[466] We have already seen how this became a stock\r\ndescription of the subject copied with little change by successive\r\nwriters and embodied in the decretals of the church. It is rather\r\nsurprising that a writer as well versed in the classics as John is\r\ngenerally supposed to be should not have borrowed his account more\r\ndirectly from some such ancient Latin writers as Pliny and Apuleius.\r\nJohn, however, alters the wording and arrangement and consequently the\r\nemphasis considerably. He makes it seem, for example, that several\r\nmagic arts, which really have nothing to do with predicting the future,\r\nare sub-varieties of divination. He also adds some new varieties to\r\nIsidore’s list of practitioners of the magic arts. The _vultivoli_ try\r\nto affect men by making images of them from wax or clay. _Imaginarii_,\r\non the other hand, make images with the intent that demons should enter\r\nthese images and instruct them in regard to doubtful matters. Besides\r\ninterpreters of dreams (_conjectores_) and chiromancers John further\r\nmentions _specularii_ who practise divination by gazing into polished\r\nsurfaces such as the edges of swords, basins, and mirrors. It was this\r\nart that Joseph is described as exercising or pretending to exercise,\r\nwhen he charged his brothers with having made off with the cup in which\r\nhe was wont to practice divination. The thirteenth and closing chapter\r\nof John’s first book is a long list of omens from Roman history and\r\nLatin literature, especially Vergil.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Relation of Thomas Becket to John’s discussion.]\r\n\r\nIn the second book he resumes the same subject after a brief and\r\nsomewhat apologetic preface in which he states that all things are of\r\nuse to the wise man. Therefore he responds with alacrity to Thomas\r\nBecket’s request that he publish his trifles, introducing interpreters\r\nof dreams and astrologers with some other triflers. We shall later meet\r\nwith some further explanation of Thomas’ interest in such matters. It\r\nis perhaps significant that John further expresses his confidence that\r\nThomas will faithfully protect those in whom he has inspired boldness\r\nof utterance,[467] but it would be too much to assume from it that\r\nJohn fears any persecution because he discusses such subjects. More\r\nlikely he merely shares the common medieval fear of the envious bite of\r\ncritics and reviewers, or wishes to remind Thomas of his need of his\r\npatronage. At any rate he closes the prologue with the request that\r\nThomas will correct any mistake in either book.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Inconsistent Christian attitude toward superstition.]\r\n\r\nIn opening his second book John subscribes to the proverb that he who\r\ntrusts in dreams and auguries will never be secure and asks--like\r\nCicero in his _De divinatione_[468]--what possible connection there\r\ncan be between sneezes, yawns, and other such things accepted as signs\r\nand the events which they are supposed to signify. With Isidore and\r\nAugustine[469]--although he names neither--he rejects those empty\r\nincantations and superstitious ligatures which the entire medical\r\nart condemns, although some call them _physica_.[470] This seems like\r\nan admirable approach to an attitude of rational criticism, but John\r\nafter all may be merely repeating others’ statements like a parrot,\r\nand he entirely spoils its effect by what he goes on to say. He\r\nbelieves that the cloak of St. Stephen raised the dead, and that such\r\npractices as saying the Lord’s prayer while plucking or administering\r\nmedicinal herbs, or wearing or hearing or repeating the names of the\r\nfour evangelists,[471] are not only allowable but most useful. He adds\r\nfurther that the force of all omens depends upon the faith of the\r\nrecipient.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Divine and natural signs.]\r\n\r\nAlthough opposing faith in omens and augury, John admits that God\r\nprovides signs for His creatures, such as those of the weather which\r\nsailors and farmers learn by experience and the birds are not ignorant\r\nof, or the indications by which doctors can prognosticate the course of\r\ndiseases. Unfortunately the demons also are able to show signs and thus\r\nlead men astray. Mention of signs which preceded the fall of Jerusalem\r\nthen leads John into a digression for several chapters concerning the\r\nhorrors of the siege itself and Vespasian and Titus, a passage which\r\nwas very likely inserted because Henry II and Becket were at that very\r\ntime engaged in laying siege to Toulouse.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Miracle and occult virtue.]\r\n\r\nReturning to the subject of signs, John interprets the verse in Luke,\r\n“There shall be signs in sun and moon and stars” as having reference\r\nto unnatural signs, and the obscuration of the sun during Christ’s\r\npassion as not a natural eclipse.[472] John explains that by nature he\r\nmeans “the accustomed course of things or the occult causes of events\r\nfor which a reason can be given.”[473] If, however, we accept Plato’s\r\ndefinition of nature as the will of God there will be no unnatural\r\nevents. But John would distinguish between the gradual growth of leaves\r\nand fruit on tree or vine by means of roots drawing nutriment from\r\nearth’s vitals and sap produced within the trunk, which is indeed\r\nmarvelous and has the most occult causes, and the performance of the\r\nsame process without any interval of time, which he regards as a\r\nmiracle and of a divine height which transcends our understanding.\r\nAfter drawing this distinction between divine miracle and wonders\r\nwrought by occult virtues in nature John returns again to the subject\r\nof signs.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Interpretation of dreams.]\r\n\r\nFor some chapters the topic of dreams and their interpretation absorbs\r\nhis attention,[474] and at first he discusses in an apparently\r\ncredulous and approving tone “the varied significations of dreams,\r\nwhich both experience approves and the authority of our ancestors\r\nconfirms.”[475] He explains that now the dream concerns the dreamer\r\nhimself, now someone else, now common interests, sometimes the public\r\nor general welfare; and he quotes Nestor to the effect that “trust\r\nis put in the king’s dream concerning public matters.”[476] After\r\nreferring credulously to the Sibylline verses predicting Christ’s\r\nincarnation, passion, and ascension, John continues his exposition\r\nof the interpretation of dreams. He explains that the season of\r\nyear when one dreams, the place where one dreams, and the personal\r\ncharacteristics of the dreamer must all be taken into account; that\r\nsometimes interpretations should be by contraries, and again from\r\nlike to like. But then he checks himself with the words: “But while\r\nwe pursue these traditions of the interpreters, I fear lest we\r\ndeservedly seem not so much to trace the art of interpretation, which\r\nis either no art at all or an idle one, as to dream ourselves.” He\r\nadds further, “Whoever fastens his credulity to the significations of\r\ndreams evidently wanders as far from sincere faith as from the path of\r\nreason.”[477]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Dreams of Joseph and Daniel.]\r\n\r\nJohn then attacks the _Dream-Book of Daniel_, which he says “circulates\r\nimpudently among the hands of the curious” and gives a specific\r\ninterpretation for each thing imagined by the dreamer. He denies the\r\ntruth and authority of the book and argues at some length that neither\r\nJoseph nor Daniel would have composed such a work, and that they\r\ninterpreted dreams by divine inspiration, not by any occult art learned\r\nin Chaldea or Egypt. In the first place, the method of interpretation\r\nset forth in this book is faulty and crude. The remainder of John’s\r\nargument is worth quoting in part:\r\n\r\n“Daniel indeed had the grace to interpret visions and dreams, which\r\nthe Lord inspired in him, but it is inconceivable that a holy man\r\nshould reduce this vanity to an art, when he knew that the Mosaic law\r\nprohibited any of the faithful to heed dreams, being aware how Satan’s\r\nsatellite for the subversion of men is transformed into an angel of\r\nlight and how suggestions are made by bad angels. Joseph, too, won\r\nthe rule of Egypt by his ability to predict.... But if this could\r\nhave come from any science of human wisdom, I should think that some\r\none of his ancestors before him would have merited it, or I should\r\nthink that the saint, desirous of serving science and full of pious\r\nimpulses, would have left the art as a legacy, if not to the human race\r\nat large, which would nevertheless have been just, at any rate to his\r\nbrothers and sons. Besides, Moses, trained in all the wisdom of the\r\nEgyptians, either was ignorant of or spurned this art, since, detesting\r\nthe error of impiety, he took pains to exterminate it from among God’s\r\npeople. Furthermore, St. Daniel learned the studies and wisdom of the\r\nChaldeans, which, as a saint, he would not have done, had he thought\r\nit sinful to be instructed in their lore. And he had companions in\r\nhis education whom he rejoiced to have as comrades in divine law\r\nand justice. For at the same time Ananias, Axarias, Misael learned\r\nwhatever a Chaldean would learn.... But notice that the privilege which\r\nman could not confer was given to Daniel alone, to bring to light the\r\nriddles of dreams and to scatter the obscurities of figures....”\r\n\r\nPointing out that Daniel read the king’s thoughts and prophesied “the\r\nmystery of salvation” in addition to interpreting the dream, John then\r\nconcludes sarcastically: “Are the interpreters of dreams thus wont to\r\nexamine thoughts and remove obscurities, to explain what is involved\r\nand illuminate the darkness of figures? If there is any who enjoys a\r\nlike portion of grace, let him join Daniel and Joseph and like them\r\nascribe to God the glory. He whom the spirit of truth does not illume\r\nvainly puts his confidence in the art of dreams.”[478]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The witchcraft delusion.]\r\n\r\nJohn concludes that many dreams are the work of demons.[479] Especially\r\nas of this sort he classifies the illusions of those who think that\r\nthey have taken part during the night in witches’ Sabbats. “What they\r\nsuffer in spirit they most wretchedly and falsely believe to have\r\noccurred in the body.”[480] And such dreams come mainly to women,\r\nfeeble-minded men, and those weak in the Christian faith. Too much\r\nstress must not, however, be laid upon this apparent opposition to the\r\nwitchcraft delusion.[481] John admits that the demons send dreams, and\r\nif he denies their verity, he merely repeats a hesitation as to the\r\nextent and reality of the power of demons over the body of men and the\r\nworld of nature which we have frequently met in patristic literature\r\nand which is due to a natural reluctance to admit that their magic is\r\nas real as God’s miracles.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Prevalence of astrology.]\r\n\r\nFrom divination by dreams and demons John passes to astrology. To\r\nstart with he admits the attraction which the art has for men of\r\nintellect in his own time. “Would,” he exclaims, “that the error of the\r\n_mathematici_ could be as readily removed from enlightened minds as the\r\nworks of the demons fade before true faith and a sane consciousness\r\nof their illusions. But in it men go astray with the greater peril in\r\nthat they seem to base their error upon nature’s firm foundation and\r\nreason’s strength.”[482] Beginning with mathematical and astronomical\r\ntruths based on nature, reason and experience, they gradually slip\r\ninto error, submitting human destiny to the stars and pretending to\r\nknowledge which belongs to God alone.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: John’s attack upon it.]\r\n\r\nJohn ridicules the astrologers for attributing sex to the stars and\r\nstating the exact characteristics and influences of each planet, when\r\nthey cannot agree among themselves whether the stars are composed of\r\nthe four elements or some fifth essence, and when they are confounded\r\nby a schoolboy’s question whether the stars are hard or soft.[483] He\r\ngrants that the sun’s heat and the moon’s control of humors as it waxes\r\nand wanes are potent forces, and that the other heavenly bodies are\r\nthe causes of many utilities, and that from their position and signs\r\nthe weather may be predicted. But he complains that the astrologers\r\nmagnify the influence of the stars at the expense of God’s control\r\nof nature and of human free will. “They ascribe everything to their\r\nconstellations.” Some have even reached such a degree of madness that\r\nthey believe that “an image can be formed in accordance with the\r\nconstellations so that it will receive the spirit of life at the nod of\r\nthe stars and will reveal the secrets of hidden truth.”[484] Whether\r\nJohn has some magic automaton or merely an engraved astrological image\r\nin mind is not entirely clear.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Does astrology imply fatal necessity?]\r\n\r\nJohn is aware, however, that many astrologers will deny that their\r\nscience detracts in any way from divine prerogative and power, and\r\nwill “appear to themselves to excuse their error quite readily” by\r\nasserting with Plotinus that God foreknew and consequently foredisposed\r\neverything that is to occur, and that the stars are as much under his\r\ncontrol as any part of nature.[485] But John will have none of this\r\nsort of argument. “These hypotheses of theirs are indeed plausible but\r\nnevertheless venom lies under the honey. For they impose on things a\r\ncertain fatal necessity under the guise of humility and reverence to\r\nGod, fearing lest his intent should perchance alter, if the outcome\r\nof things were not made necessary. Furthermore, they encroach upon\r\nthe domain of divine majesty, when they lay claim to that science of\r\nforeseeing times and seasons, which by the Son’s testimony are reserved\r\nto the power of the Father, even to the degree that they were hid from\r\nthe eyes of those to whom the Son of God revealed whatever He heard\r\nfrom the Father.”[486]\r\n\r\nJohn furthermore contends that divine foreknowledge does not require\r\nfatal necessity. For instance, although God knew that Adam would sin,\r\nAdam was under no compulsion to do so. God knew that by his guilt Adam\r\nwould bring death into the world, but no condition of nature impelled\r\nhim to this; in the beginning man was immortal. At this point John\r\nwanders off into a joust at the Stoics and Epicureans, whom he censures\r\nas equally in error, since the one subjected all to chance, the other\r\nto necessity. It is true, John argues, that I know a stone will fall to\r\nearth if I hurl it skywards, but it “does not act under necessity, for\r\nit might fall or not.” But that it does fall, “though not necessary,\r\nis true.” John presently recognizes that he has given away his previous\r\nargument against astrology and that the devotee of the stars will\r\nsay that he does not care whether his predictions are necessary or\r\nnot provided they are true. “‘Nor does it make any difference to\r\nme,’ says the devotee of the stars, ‘whether the affair in question\r\nmight be otherwise, provided I am not doubtful that it will be (as I\r\nthink.)’”[487]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: John’s lame conclusion.]\r\n\r\nJohn accordingly resorts to other arguments and to facetious sarcasm\r\nto cover his confusion. Then he recovers sufficiently to reiterate\r\nhis belief that God frequently interferes in the operation of nature\r\nby special providences; and asserts that God has been known to change\r\nHis mind, while the astrologers assert that the stars are constant in\r\ntheir influences. Expressing doubt, however, whether Thomas Becket will\r\nbe convinced by his arguments, especially the one concerning fate and\r\nProvidence, or whether he will not laugh up his sleeve at such a clumsy\r\nattempt to refute so formidable a doctrine, John lamely concludes by\r\nciting Augustine and Gregory against the art, and by affirming that\r\nevery astrologer whom he has known has come to some bad end,[488] in\r\nwhich assertion he probably simply echoes Tertullian.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Other varieties of magic.]\r\n\r\nResuming his discussion of the varieties of magic John briefly\r\ndismisses necromancers with the _bon mot_ that those deserve death\r\nwho try to acquire knowledge from the dead.[489] A number of other\r\nterms in Isidore’s list--_auspices_, augurs, _salissatores_, _arioli_,\r\n_pythonici_, _aruspices_--he says it is needless to discuss further\r\nsince these arts are no longer practiced in his day, or at least\r\nnot openly. Turning to more living superstitions of the present, he\r\nexplains that chiromancy professes to discern truths which lie hidden\r\nin the wrinkles of the hands, but that since there is no apparent\r\nreason for this belief it is not necessary to contravert it.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Thomas Becket’s consultation of diviners.]\r\n\r\nJohn wishes to ask Thomas one thing, however, and that is what triflers\r\nof this sort say when they are interrogated concerning uncertain\r\nfuture matters. He knows that Becket is familiar with such men because\r\non the occasion of a recent royal expedition against Brittany he\r\nconsulted both an aruspex and a chiromancer. John notes that a few days\r\nafterwards Thomas “lost without warning the morning-star so to speak\r\nof your race,” and warns him that such men by their vanity deserve to\r\nbe consulted no more. This gentle rebuke did not avail, however, to\r\nwean Thomas entirely from his practice of consulting diviners, which\r\nhe continued to do even after he became Archbishop of Canterbury. In a\r\nletter written to the future martyr and saint in 1170 John again chides\r\nThomas for having delayed certain important letters because he had been\r\n“deluded by soothsayings which were not of the Spirit” and exhorts him\r\n“So let us renounce soothsayings in the future.”[490]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Witch of Endor: exorcisms.]\r\n\r\nDespite his previous declaration that he need not discuss the\r\n_pythonici_, John now proceeds to do so, listing instances of ambiguous\r\nand deceptive Delphic oracles and discussing at length the well-worn\r\nsubject of Saul and the witch of Endor. He concludes the chapter by a\r\nwarning against abuse of the practice of exorcism: “For such is the\r\nslyness of evil spirits that what they do of their own accord and what\r\nmen do at their suggestion, they with great pains disguise so that\r\nthey appear to perform it unwillingly. They pretend to be coerced\r\nand simulate to be drawn out as it were by the power of exorcisms,\r\nand that they may be the less guarded against they compose exorcisms\r\napparently expressed in the name of God or in the faith of the Trinity\r\nor in the power of the incarnation or passion; and they transmit the\r\nsame to men and obey men who use these, until they finally involve them\r\nwith themselves in the crime of sacrilege and penalty of damnation.\r\nSometimes they even transform themselves into angels of light, they\r\nteach only things of good repute, forbid unlawful things, strive to\r\nimitate purity, make provision for needs, so that, as if good and\r\nfavoring, they are received the more familiarly, are heard the more\r\nkindly, are loved the more closely, are the more readily obeyed. They\r\nalso put on the guise of venerable persons....”[491]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Divination from polished surfaces.]\r\n\r\n“The _specularii_,” John continues, “flatter themselves that they\r\nimmolate no victims, harm no one, often do good as when they detect\r\nthefts, purge the world of sorceries, and seek only useful or necessary\r\ntruth.”[492] He insists that the success of their efforts is none the\r\nless due to demon aid. John tells how as a boy he was handed over\r\nfor instruction in the Psalms to a priest who turned out to be a\r\npractitioner of this variety of magic, who after performing various\r\nadjurations and sorceries tried to have John and another boy look\r\ninto polished basins or finger-nails smeared with holy oil or chrism\r\nand report what they saw. The other boy saw some ghostly shapes but\r\nJohn thanks God that he could see nothing and so was not employed\r\nhenceforth in this manner. He adds that he has known many _specularii_\r\nand that they have all suffered loss of their sight or some other evil\r\nexcept the aforesaid priest and a deacon, and that they took refuge\r\nin monasteries and later suffered evils above their fellows in their\r\nrespective congregations.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Natural science and medicine.]\r\n\r\nJohn closes his second book with a chapter on natural scientists\r\nand medical men, for he seems to apply the term _physici_ in both\r\nsenses, although towards the close of the chapter he also employs the\r\nword _medici_. He begins by saying that it is permissible to consult\r\nconcerning the future anyone who has the spirit of prophecy or who\r\nfrom scientific training knows by natural signs what will happen in\r\nthe bodies of animals, or who “has learned experimentally the nature\r\nof the time impending,” provided only that these latter men say and\r\ndo nothing prejudicial to the Christian faith. But sometimes the\r\n_physici_ attribute too much to nature,[493] and John has heard many\r\nof them disputing concerning the soul and its virtues and operations,\r\nthe increase and diminution of the body, the resurrection, and the\r\ncreation, in a way far from accord with the Christian faith. “Of God\r\nHimself too they sometimes so speak, ‘As if earth-born giants assailed\r\nthe stars.’”[494] John recognizes, however, their knowledge of animals\r\nand medicine, although he finds their theories sometimes in conflict.\r\nAs for practicing physicians, he dares not speak ill of them, for he\r\ntoo often falls into their hands, and he grants that no one is more\r\nnecessary or useful than a good doctor. John makes considerable use of\r\nthe _Natural History_ of Pliny and of Solinus, and sometimes for occult\r\nor marvelous phenomena, as when he cites Pliny concerning men who have\r\nthe power of fascination by voice and tongue or by their glances, and\r\nadds the testimony of the Physiognomists.[495]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Summary.]\r\n\r\nIt may be well to review and further emphasize some of the chief\r\nfeatures of John’s rather rambling discussion. Despite its frequent\r\nquotations from classic poets and moralists, it is theological in\r\ntone and content to a degree perhaps greater than I have succeeded\r\nin suggesting, for to repeat all its scriptural passages would be\r\ntedious. There is even some theological jealousy and suspicion of\r\nnatural science shown. John perhaps more nearly duplicates the attitude\r\nof Augustine than that of any other writer. Magic is represented as\r\ninevitably associated with, and the work of, demons. John sometimes\r\ncharges the magic arts with being irrational or injurious, but these\r\ncharges are in a way but corollaries of his main thesis. The arts must\r\nbe harmful since demons are concerned with them, while the influence\r\nof demons seems the only rational explanation for their existence.\r\nJohn repeats the old Isidorian definition of magic but he adds some\r\ncurrent superstitions and shows that the magic arts are far from having\r\nfallen into disuse. Finally he shows us how vain must have been all\r\nthe ecclesiastical thunders and warnings of demons and damnation,\r\nlike his own, directed against magic, from the fact that not merely\r\nkings of the past like Saul and Pharaoh, but clergy of the present\r\nthemselves--a priest and a deacon, a chancellor and an archbishop\r\nof England--practice or patronize such arts. Sometimes John’s own\r\ncondemnation of them seems a bit perfunctory; he takes more relish, it\r\nseems at times, in describing them. Again, as in the case of astrology,\r\nhe evidently feels that his opposition will be of little avail.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[461] _Johannis Sarisberiensis Episcopi Carnotensis Policratici sive\r\nde nugis curialium et vestigiis philosophorum libri VIII._ Recog.

Like\r\nAdelard of Bath, Daniel had long absented himself from England in the\r\npursuit of learning, and had first spent some time at Paris, apparently\r\nengaged in the study of Roman law. He became disgusted, however, with\r\nthe instruction there and in his preface[496] speaks sarcastically of\r\n“the brutes” (_bestiales_) who occupied professorial chairs “with grave\r\nauthority” and read from codices too heavy to carry (_importabiles_)\r\nwhich reproduced in golden letters the traditions of Ulpian. Holding\r\nlead pencils in their hands, they marked these volumes reverently\r\nwith obeli and asterisks. They wished to conceal their ignorance by\r\nmaintaining a dignified and statuesque silence, “but when they tried\r\nto say something, I found them most childish.” Daniel accordingly made\r\nhaste away to Spain to acquire the learning of the Arabs and to hear\r\n“wiser philosophers of the universe.” Finally, however, his friends\r\nsummoned him back to England and he returned “with an abundant supply\r\nof precious volumes.” On his arrival he found that the interest in\r\nRoman law had almost completely eclipsed that in Greek philosophy, and\r\nthat Aristotle and Plato were assigned to oblivion. Not wishing to\r\nremain the sole Greek among Romans, he prepared to withdraw again where\r\nthe studies in which he was interested flourished. But on the way he\r\nmet John, bishop of Norwich (1175-1200) who asked him many questions\r\nconcerning his studies at Toledo and the marvels of that city, and\r\nconcerning astronomy and the rule of the superior bodies over this\r\nsublunar world. Daniel’s present treatise gives a fuller reply to these\r\ninquiries than time then permitted him to make.\r\n\r\n In the following bibliographical note the MSS will be listed\r\n first and then the printed works by or concerning Daniel of\r\n Morley.\r\n\r\n Arundel 377, 13th century, well-written small quarto, fols.\r\n 88-103, “Philosophia magistri danielis de merlai ad iohannem\r\n Norwicensem episcopum ... / ... Explicit liber de naturis\r\n inferiorum et superiorum.” Until very recently this was\r\n supposed to be the only MS of Daniel’s sole extant work.\r\n No other treatise has as yet been identified as his, but\r\n several other MSS may be noted of the whole or parts of the\r\n aforesaid “Philosophia” or “Liber de naturis inferiorum et\r\n superiorum.”\r\n\r\n Corpus Christi 95, 13th century, where, according to K.\r\n Sudhoff in the publication noted below, the first two or\r\n three books ascribed to William of Conches are really the\r\n work of Daniel of Morley.\r\n\r\n Berlin Latin Quarto 387, 12th century, 51 fols. Attention\r\n was called to it by Birkenmajer in the publication noted\r\n below. It has many slips of copyists and is regarded by him\r\n as neither the original nor a direct copy thereof. For the\r\n MS to be written in the twelfth century this would require\r\n a very rapid multiplication and dissemination of Daniel’s\r\n treatise which was at the earliest not composed until after\r\n 1175.\r\n\r\n The remaining MSS have not hitherto been noted by writers on\r\n Daniel:\r\n\r\n CUL 1935 (Kk. I. 1), 13th century, small folio, fols.\r\n 98r-105r (and not to 115r, as stated in the MSS catalogue,\r\n which gives Daniel Morley as the author, but _De creatione\r\n mundi_ as the title). From rotographs of fols. 98r-v, 100r,\r\n and 105r, I judge that this copy is almost identical with\r\n Arundel 377 but somewhat less legible and accurate.\r\n\r\n Oriel 7, 14th century folio, fols. 194v-196v (191-193,\r\n according to Coxe), extracts from _De philosophia Danielis_,\r\n opening, “Nos qui mistice.”... They are immediately preceded\r\n by extracts from “Adelardi Bathoniensis ... de decisionibus\r\n naturalibus.”\r\n\r\n Corpus Christi 263, early 17thI’ll sp century, fols.\r\n 166v-67r, “Ex Daniele de Merlai” (or, “Merlac,” according to\r\n Coxe) “alias Morley in lib. de superioribus et inferioribus\r\n primo De creationis Mundi.” This MS is one of the notebooks\r\n of Brian Twyne, the Elizabethan antiquary, written in his\r\n own hand.\r\n\r\n Twyne perhaps made his extracts from Arundel 377, for\r\n immediately after them he gives extracts “from William of\r\n Conches who is together with Daniel Merlai in our library,”\r\n and in Arundel 377 Daniel’s work is immediately followed\r\n by that of William of Conches. Moreover, of the Selden MSS\r\n which are now in the Bodleian, Supra 72 was once owned by\r\n Lord “William Howarde” who died in 1640, while Supra 77 is\r\n marked “Arundel,” referring presumably to Thomas Howard,\r\n Earl of Arundel, who died in 1646, and Supra 79 consists\r\n of astronomical and astrological treatises copied by Brian\r\n Twyne. If MSS which once belonged to the Arundel collection\r\n and to Twyne have thus passed somehow into the Selden\r\n collection and are found listed there in close proximity to\r\n one another, it is at least tempting to conjecture that the\r\n MS containing Daniel’s treatise, followed by that of William\r\n of Conches, which Twyne says was once “in our library,”\r\n somehow became Arundel 377.\r\n\r\n BN 6415 does not contain _De philosophia Danielis_, as\r\n stated by C. Jourdain (1838) p. 101; Jourdain, however,\r\n regarded Adelard of Bath as the author of _De philosophia\r\n Danielis_, and BN 6415 does contain Adelard’s _Questiones\r\n naturales_.\r\n\r\n Balliol 96, 15th century, a commentary upon Aristotle’s\r\n eight books of Physics in the form of questions and preceded\r\n by a prologue, “Expliciunt questiones super 8 libros\r\n phisicorum compilate a domino Marlo magistro in artibus\r\n Tholose ac canonico de Timsey.” This does not seem to be a\r\n work by Daniel of Morley; a cursory examination revealed no\r\n reason for thinking that _domino Marlo_ should read _Daniele\r\n Merlai_, or that _Tholose_ should be _Tholeto_.\r\n\r\n I have not examined two MSS at Queen’s College, Oxford, Reg.\r\n lxxi; lxxiv, 4) containing pedigrees of the Morlay or Morley\r\n family which may possibly throw some light upon Daniel’s\r\n identity.\r\n\r\n All the printing that has been done of Daniel’s treatise\r\n has been based upon Arundel 377. J. O. Halliwell, _Rara\r\n Mathematica_, 1839, and Thomas Wright, _Biographia\r\n Literaria_, London, 1846, II, 227-30, printed the preface\r\n and other brief extracts for the first time.\r\n\r\n Valentin Rose reprinted the preface and also published\r\n the conclusion in his article, “Ptolemaeus und die Schule\r\n von Toledo,” _Hermes_ VIII (1874) 327-49. Rose also gave\r\n a list of the authorities cited by Daniel which makes a\r\n very large number of omissions: for example, fol. 89r,\r\n “sicut in trismegisto repperitur” and “isidori”; fol. 90v,\r\n Aristotle, “philosophus,” “Adultimus” (?), “Platonitus”;\r\n fol. 91r, “Esiodus autem naturalis scientie professor omnia\r\n dixit esse ex terra,” and so on for “tales milesius,”\r\n Democritus, and other Greek philosophers; fol. 91v, “sicut\r\n ab inexpugnabili sententia magni hermetis”; fol. 92r,\r\n “audiat ysidori in libro differentiarum”; fol. 92v, “unde\r\n astrologus ille poeta de creatione mundi ait,” and “magnus\r\n mercurius” and “trismegistus mercurius” and “trismegistus\r\n mercurius praedicti mercurii nepos”; fol. 97r, “Aristotelis\r\n in libro de sensu et sensato,” “Albumaxar,” “Aristotelis\r\n in libro de auditu naturali”; fol. 98v, “in libro de celi\r\n et mundo”; fol. 99v, Almagest, and “Ypocrati et galieno”;\r\n fol. 100v, “liber veneris ... quem edidit thoz grecus,” and\r\n “aristoteles ... in libro de speculo adurenti.”\r\n\r\n Karl Sudhoff, _Daniels von Morley Liber de naturis\r\n inferiorum et superiorum nach der Handschrift Cod. Arundel\r\n 377 des Britischen Museums zum Abdruck gebracht_, in\r\n _Archiv für die Geschichte der Naturwissenschaften und der\r\n Technik_, Band 8, 1917 (but not received at the New York\r\n Public Library until July 8, 1921). Here is printed for the\r\n first time the full text of Daniel’s treatise as contained\r\n in Arundel 377, but from photographs taken years before\r\n and apparently without further reference to the MS itself.\r\n Also according to the following article by Birkenmajer,\r\n Sudhoff sometimes renders the contractions and abbreviations\r\n incorrectly. As Sudhoff’s text comes late to my hand, I\r\n leave my references to the folios of Arundel 377 as they\r\n are. These folios (with the exception of 88v) are marked in\r\n Sudhoff’s text.\r\n\r\n Alexander Birkenmajer, _Eine neue Handschrift des Liber de\r\n naturis inferiorum et superiorum des Daniel von Merlai_, in\r\n the same _Archiv_, December, 1920, pp. 45-51, gives some\r\n variant readings from Berlin 387.\r\n\r\n Dr. Charles Singer has published a brief account of Daniel\r\n of Morley in a recent issue of _Isis_.\r\n\r\n The article on Daniel in DNB XXXIX (1894) by A. F. Pollard\r\n is criticized by Sudhoff for failing to mention “Roses\r\n wichtigste Vorarbeit;” but I observe that Sudhoff himself\r\n similarly fails to mention the publications by Halliwell and\r\n Thomas Wright which preceded both Rose’s and his own.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Defense of Arabian learning.]\r\n\r\nDaniel warns his readers at the start not to scorn the simple language\r\nand lucid style in which the doctrines of the Arabs are set forth, or\r\nto mistake the laborious circumlocutions and ambiguous obscurities of\r\ncontemporary Latins for signs of profound learning. Nor should anyone\r\nbe alarmed because he presents the opinions of Gentile philosophers\r\ninstead of church fathers in treating of the creation of the world.\r\nThey may not have been Christians, but where their opinions seem\r\nsound, Daniel believes in taking spoils of learning even from pagans\r\nand infidels, as God instructed the Hebrews to do in the case of the\r\ngolden and silver vessels of the Egyptians. Thus he borrows the theory\r\nof a triple universe from an Arabic work. The first universe exists\r\nonly in the divine mind and is neither visible nor corporeal, but is\r\neternal. The second universe is in work and is visible, corporeal, and\r\nin that state not eternal. It was created simultaneously with time.\r\nThe third universe is imitative. It is the microcosm and was formed in\r\ntime and is visible and corporeal, but is in part eternal.[497] In a\r\nlater passage[498] Daniel again defends his use of Arabian authorities,\r\ncontending that it is only just that one who is already informed\r\nconcerning the opinions about things supercelestial of the philosophers\r\nin use among the Latins should also not disdain to listen attentively\r\nto the views of the Arabs which cannot be impugned. It may be perilous\r\nto imitate them in some respects, but one should be informed even on\r\nsuch points in order to be able to refute and avoid the errors to which\r\nthey lead.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A moderate treatment of moot points between science and\r\nreligion.]\r\n\r\nIn general plan, tone, and content, as well as in the title,\r\n_Philosophia_, Daniel’s treatise roughly resembles that of William of\r\nConches. As Daniel says in his preface, the first part deals with the\r\ninferior portion of the universe, and the second part with the superior\r\npart. The work proper opens with a discussion of the creation, in which\r\nDaniel expresses some rather original ideas, although he treats of such\r\ntime-worn topics as God’s creation of the angels, of the universe, and\r\nof man in His own image, and then of man’s fall through concupiscence,\r\nvirtue and vice, and like matters. Later he argues against those who\r\nhold that the world is eternal, but he is not quite ready to accept the\r\nMosaic account of creation entire. He argues that in the beginning God\r\ncreated heaven and earth and cites Augustine, Isidore, and Bede to show\r\nthat the meaning is that heaven and earth were created simultaneously.\r\nHe then adds that philosophers are loath to accept the division of the\r\nworks of creation over six days; in human works it is true that one\r\nthing must be done before another, but God could dispense everything\r\nwith “one eternal word.”[499]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The four elements and fifth essence.]\r\n\r\nThe four elements are discussed a good deal and it is explained that\r\nfire is hot and dry, air is hot and wet, and so on.[500] To fire\r\ncorrespond cholera, the light of the eyes, and curiosity; to air,\r\nblood, words, and loquacity; to water, phlegm, abundance of natural\r\nhumors, and lust; to earth, melancholy, corpulence, and cruelty.[501]\r\nDaniel, like Adelard of Bath and William of Conches, repeats the\r\ndoctrine that the four elements are not found in a pure state in any\r\nbodies perceptible to our sense, that no one has ever touched earth\r\nor water, or seen pure air or fire, and that the four elements are\r\nperceptible only to the intellect. Daniel differs from Adelard and\r\nWilliam, however, in denying that the stars are made merely out of the\r\npurer parts of the four elements. He declares that the Arabs will not\r\nagree to this, but that the higher authorities in astrology assert that\r\nthe stars are composed of a fifth essence.[502] Daniel furthermore\r\nspeaks of three bonds existing between the four elements, stating that\r\nscientists call the relation between fire and air, obedience; that\r\nbetween air and water, harmony; and that between water and earth,\r\nnecessity.[503] This faintly reminds one of the three relationships\r\nbetween the four principles of things which were associated with the\r\nnames of the three fates in the essay on fate ascribed to Plutarch.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Superiors and inferiors.]\r\n\r\nBut the greatest bond in nature is that existing between the superior\r\nand inferior worlds. An oft-repeated and fundamental principle of\r\nDaniel’s philosophy, and one which explains the division of his work\r\ninto two parts, is the doctrine that superiors conquer inferiors, that\r\nthe world of the sky controls the world of the four elements, and that\r\nthe science of the stars is superior to all other disciplines.[504]\r\n“The sages of this world have divided the world into two parts, of\r\nwhich the superior one which extends from the circle of the moon even\r\nto the immovable heaven is the agent. The other, from the lunar globe\r\ndownwards, is the patient.”[505] Much depends, however, not only upon\r\nthe force emitted by the agent but upon the readiness of the patient to\r\nreceive the celestial influence.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Daniel’s astronomy.]\r\n\r\nDaniel of course believed in a spherical earth and a geocentric\r\nuniverse. Influenced probably by the _Almagest_, he explains the\r\neccentrics of the five planets in a way which he regards as superior to\r\nwhat he calls the errors of Martianus Capella and almost all Latins,\r\nand to the obscure traditions which the Arabs have handed down but\r\nscarcely understood themselves.[506] He affirms that there are not ten\r\nheavens or spheres, as some have said, but only eight, as Alphraganus\r\ntruly teaches.[507]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Astrological argument.]\r\n\r\nThere are some men who deny any efficacy to the motions of the stars,\r\nbut Daniel charges that they for the most part condemn the science\r\nwithout knowing anything about it, “and hold astronomy in hatred from\r\nits name alone.”[508] He replies that it is useful to foreknow the\r\nfuture and defends astrology in much the usual manner. He details the\r\nqualities of the seven planets[509] whom the Arabs call “lords of\r\nnativities.”[510] Also he takes up the properties and attributes of the\r\nsigns of the zodiac and how the Arabs divide the parts of the human\r\nbody among them.[511]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Astrology and other sciences.]\r\n\r\nDaniel interprets the scope of astrology very broadly, asserting\r\nthat it has eight parts: the science of judgments, or what we should\r\ncall judicial astrology; medicine; nigromancy according to physics;\r\nagriculture; illusions or magic (_de praestigiis_); alchemy, “which\r\nis the science of the transmutation of metals into other species;\r\nthe science of images, which Thoz Grecus set forth in the great and\r\nuniversal book of Venus; and the science of mirrors, which is of\r\nbroader scope and aim than the rest, as Aristotle shows in the treatise\r\non the burning glass.”[512] Except that magic illusions have replaced\r\nnavigation, this list of eight branches of learning is the same as\r\nthat which Gundissalinus repeated from Al-Farabi, but which they\r\ncalled branches of natural science rather than of astrology. At any\r\nrate we see again the close association of natural science and useful\r\narts with astrology and magic, and necromancy and alchemy, and with\r\npseudo-writings of Aristotle and Hermes Trismegistus. In other passages\r\nDaniel cites genuine Aristotelian treatises[513] and speaks of “the\r\ngreat Mercury” and of the other “Mercury Trismegistus, the nephew of\r\nthe aforesaid.”[514] Despite his subordination of alchemy to astrology\r\nin the above passage, Daniel does not seem to have it in mind when he\r\nremarks that there are “some who assign diverse colors of metals to the\r\nplanets,” as lead to Saturn, silver to Jupiter, white to Venus, and\r\nblack to Mercury.[515] He goes on to deny that the stars are really\r\ncolored any more than the sky is.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Daniel and Greek: a misinterpretation.]\r\n\r\nSome modern scholars have drawn inferences from Daniel’s treatise\r\nwith which I am unable to agree. Mr. S. A. Hirsch in his edition of\r\nRoger Bacon’s Greek Grammar follows Cardinal Gasquet[516] in observing\r\nconcerning Daniel’s preface, “There can be no clearer testimony than\r\nthis to the complete oblivion into which Greek had in those days fallen\r\nin western Europe, including England.” It may be granted that there was\r\nand had been little knowledge of Greek grammar and the Greek language\r\nin twelfth century England, but that is not what Daniel is talking\r\nabout: indeed, there seems to be no reason for believing Daniel himself\r\nproficient in either Greek grammar or Greek literature, although he was\r\nshrewd enough to question whether Chalcidius always interpreted Plato\r\naright.[517] When he calls himself “the only Greek among Romans,” he\r\nmeans the only one interested in Greek philosophy and astronomy and in\r\ntranslations of the same made largely from the Arabic. But earlier in\r\nthe same century we have seen Adelard of Bath, William of Conches, and\r\nBernard Silvester interested either in Platonism or Arabic science,\r\nand the anonymous Sicilian translator of the Almagest from the Greek,\r\nand before him Burgundio of Pisa and other translators from the Greek.\r\nTherefore all that Daniel’s remarks seems to indicate is that there\r\nwas less interest in Greek philosophy in England after his return than\r\nbefore he went away, owing to the temporary popularity of the study of\r\nRoman law. But he knew where the studies in which he was interested\r\nstill flourished.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Daniel and the church: a misinterpretation.]\r\n\r\nA more serious misinterpretation of Daniel’s relation to his age is\r\nValentin Rose’s assertion that, because of Daniel’s addiction to\r\nArabian and astrological doctrines, “his book found no favor in the\r\neyes of the church and was shunned like poison. It has left no traces\r\nin subsequent literature; no one has read it and no one cites it.”[518]\r\nRose spoke on the assumption that only one copy of Daniel’s treatise\r\nhad reached us, whereas now we know of several manuscripts of it. If it\r\ndid not become so widely known as some works, the more probable reason\r\nfor this may well be that his brief résumé of Arabic and astrological\r\ndoctrines appeared too late, when the fuller works of Ptolemy and of\r\nthe Arabic astrologers were already becoming known through complete\r\nLatin translations. Brief pioneer treatises, like those of Adelard\r\nof Bath and William of Conches, which had appeared earlier in the\r\ncentury, had had time to become widely known during a period when\r\nthere was perhaps nothing fuller and better available. But Daniel’s\r\nlittle trickle of learning from Toledo, which does not represent any\r\nvery considerable advance over Adelard and William, might well be\r\nengulfed in the great stream of translations that now poured from Spain\r\ninto Christian western Europe.[519] It is unreasonable to conjecture\r\nthat Daniel’s book, which is rather mild anyway in its astrological\r\ndoctrine, and which was called forth by the favoring questions of a\r\nbishop, was then crushed by bitter ecclesiastical opposition; when we\r\nknow that William’s book, which actually encountered an ecclesiastical\r\nopposition of which we have no evidence in Daniel’s case, nevertheless\r\ncontinued in circulation and was much cited in the next century; and\r\nwhen we know that both Arabic and astrological doctrines and books\r\nwere widespread in Christian western Europe both in the twelfth and\r\nthirteenth centuries. Treatises with more poison of astrology in them\r\nthan his were read and cited and seem to have weathered successfully,\r\nif not to have escaped unscathed, whatever ecclesiastical censure may\r\nhave been directed against them. If Daniel’s own composition did not\r\nsecure a wide circle of readers, the chances are that “the multitude\r\nof precious volumes” which he imported from Spain to England did. And\r\nif the work of the pupil remained little cited, the translations of\r\nthe master, Gerard of Cremona, who had taught him astrology at Toledo,\r\nbecame known throughout western Europe. Thus, while Daniel’s personal\r\ninfluence may not have been vast, he reflects for us the progress of a\r\ngreat movement of which he was but a part.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Daniel’s future influence.]\r\n\r\nBut Rose was further mistaken in his assertion that Daniel’s _De\r\nphilosophia_ “has left no trace in subsequent literature; no one has\r\nread it and no one cites it.” Not only is the work found complete\r\nin three manuscripts of which Rose did not know, and of which one\r\nappears to be twice removed from the original. In a manuscript of\r\nthe fourteenth century at Oriel College, Oxford,[520] in the fitting\r\ncompany of excerpts from Adelard of Bath and Gundissalinus, are\r\nover three double column folio pages of extracts drawn from various\r\nportions of the _Philosophia_. These begin with Daniel’s excuse for\r\nborrowing the eloquence and wisdom of the infidels and with some of his\r\nutterances anent the creation of the world. They include a number of\r\nhis citations of other writers, his story of the two fountains outside\r\nthe walls of Toledo which varied in fulness with the moon’s phases and\r\ncontained salt water although remote six days journey from the sea,\r\nand other bits of his astrological doctrine. A similar, although not\r\nidentical, selection of pearls from Daniel’s philosophy is found in one\r\nof the notebooks of Brian Twyne,[521] the Elizabethan antiquary, who\r\ngives the title of Daniel’s work as _De superioribus et inferioribus_\r\nand makes extracts both from its first and second books. Both Twyne and\r\nthe Oriel manuscript’s writer seem to have been particularly impressed\r\nwith Daniel’s views concerning the creation, rather than his retailing\r\nof astrological doctrine. Twyne first repeats his statement that the\r\nquantity of the universe reveals the power of its Maker; its quality,\r\nHis wisdom; and its marvelous beauty, His unbounded good will. Twyne\r\nalso notes Daniel’s phrase, “court of the world,” for the universe.\r\nBoth Twyne and the Oriel manuscript note the passage concerning the\r\ntriple universe, and another in which Daniel tells how the three human\r\nqualities, reason, irascibility, and desire, may be either used to\r\ndiscern and resist evil, or perverted to evil courses. Both also notice\r\nhis contention that the chaos preceding creation was not _hyle_ or\r\nmatter but a certain contrariety present in matter.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Roger of Hereford.]\r\n\r\nIn the same manuscript with Daniel’s treatise is a work by another\r\nEnglishman, Roger of Hereford,[522] who was contemporary with him, who\r\nwrote treatises both in astronomy and astrology, and who, again like\r\nDaniel, was encouraged by a bishop. We are not, I believe, directly\r\ninformed whether any of his works were translations from the Arabic or\r\nwhether he was ever in Spain, but some of them sound as if they might\r\nbe at least adaptations from the Arabic. At any rate Alfred of England\r\ndedicated to Roger the translation which he made from the Arabic of the\r\npseudo-Aristotelian _De vegetabilibus_. Astronomical tables which Roger\r\ncalculated for the meridian of Hereford in 1178 are based upon tables\r\nfor Marseilles and Toledo, and the manuscript of one of his works is\r\nsaid by the copyist of 1476 to have been taken by him from an ancient\r\ncodex written in Toledo in the year 1247.[523] Other astronomical\r\ntreatises attributed to Roger are a _Theory of the Planets, a Treatise\r\nconcerning the rising and setting of the Signs_, and a _Compotus_ which\r\ndates itself in 1176 and is addressed to a Gilbert[524] who seems to\r\nbe no other than Foliot, bishop of Hereford until 1163 and thereafter\r\nbishop of London. The signature of Roger of Hereford attests one of his\r\ndocuments in 1173-1174. In 1176 in the preface to the _Compotus_[525]\r\nRoger speaks of himself as _iuvenis_, and the heading in the manuscript\r\neven calls him “Child Roger” or “Roger Child,”[526] but he also says\r\nthat he has devoted many years to learning, so that we need not regard\r\nhim as especially youthful at that time. The definite dates in his\r\ncareer seem to fall in the decade from 1170 to 1180, although his\r\nassociation with Alfred of England may well have been later.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: An astrology in four parts.]\r\n\r\nProfessor Haskins ascribes one or more astrological works to Roger\r\nof Hereford and lists a number of manuscripts with three different\r\n_Incipits_.[527] Some of these manuscripts I have examined. One at\r\nParis has the _Titulus_, “In the name of God the pious and merciful,\r\nhere opens the book of the division of astronomy and its four parts\r\ncomposed by the famous astrologer Roger of Hereford.”[528] Roger\r\nexplains that the first part is general and concerned with such\r\nmatters as “peoples, events, and states, changes of weather, famine,\r\nand mortality.” The second is special and deals with the fate of\r\nthe individual from birth to life’s close. The third deals with\r\ninterrogations and the fourth with elections. The first chapter of the\r\nfirst part is entitled, “Of the properties of the signs and planets\r\nin any country,” and opens with the statement that it has been proved\r\nby experience that the signs Aries and Jupiter have dominion in the\r\nland “baldac and babel and herach,” Libra and Saturn in the land of\r\nthe Christians, Scorpion and Venus in the land of the Arabs, Capricorn\r\nand Mercury in India, Leo and Mars over the Turks, Aquarius and the\r\nSun in Babylonia, Virgo and the Moon in Spain. The other five signs\r\nseem to be left without a country.[529] Chapter two tells how to find\r\nwhat sign dominates in any villa; three, of the powers of the planets\r\nin universal events; four, of the science of the annual significance\r\nof the planets; five, knowledge of rains for the four seasons; six,\r\nknowledge of winds in any villa;[530] nine, the twenty-eight mansions\r\nof the moon. After the tenth chapter distinguishing these mansions as\r\ndry and wet and temperate, the second part on nativities opens with\r\nthe retrospective statement, “Now we have treated of the first part of\r\nthis art, omitting what many astrologers have said without experience\r\nand without reason.”[531] After a dozen chapters on the significance\r\nof the twelve houses in nativities, the author again asserts that in\r\nhis discussion of that subject he has said nothing except what learned\r\nmen agree upon and experience has tested.[532] After devoting three\r\nchapters to the familiar astrological theme of the revolution of years,\r\nhe takes up in the third and fourth books[533] interrogations according\r\nto the twelve houses and elections, which are made in two ways\r\naccording as the nativity is or is not known. The invocation of God the\r\npious and compassionate in the _Titulus_ and the list of countries and\r\npeoples in the first chapter have a Mohammedan and oriental flavor and\r\nsuggest that the work is a translation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Another astrology in four parts.]\r\n\r\nDifferent from the foregoing is another work dealing with four parts of\r\njudicial astrology which the manuscripts ascribe to Roger of Hereford.\r\nIts opening words[534] and the subjects of its four parts all differ\r\nfrom those of the other treatise. Its first part deals with “simple\r\njudgment”; its fourth part, with “the reason of judgment”; while\r\nits second and third parts instead of third and fourth, as in the\r\nforegoing treatise, deal with interrogations, now called _Cogitatio_,\r\nand elections.[535] I know of no manuscript where this second work\r\nis to be found complete; in fact, I am inclined to surmise that\r\nusually the manuscripts give only the first of its four parts.[536] It\r\nprofesses at the start to be a brief collection of rules of judicial\r\nastrology hitherto only to be found scattered through various works.\r\nAstrology is extolled as an art of incomparable excellence without\r\nwhich other branches of learning are fruitless. “They appear to a few\r\nthrough experiments; ... it gives most certain experiments.”[537] The\r\nfirst book treats of the properties of the signs and planets, of the\r\ntwelve houses, and defines a long list of astrological terms such as\r\n_respectus_, _applicatio_, _separatio_, _periclitus_, _solitudo_,\r\n_allevatio_, _translatio_, _collatio_, _redditio_, _contradictio_,\r\n_impeditio_, _evasio_, _interruptio_, _compassio_, _renuntiatio_, and\r\n_receptio_.[538] Some tables are also given, in connection with one\r\nof which we are told that the longest hour at Hereford exceeds the\r\nshortest by eleven degrees and forty minutes.[539]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Book of Three General Judgments._]\r\n\r\nTo Roger is also ascribed a _Book of Three General Judgments of\r\nAstronomy, from which all others flow_, which sometimes is listed\r\nseparately in the manuscripts and apparently is found alone as a\r\ndistinct work,[540] but in other manuscripts[541] seems to be an\r\nintegral part of the work of four parts which we have just described.\r\nIts three general judgments are: gaining honors and escaping evils;\r\n_intentio vel meditacio_, which, like the _cogitacio_ mentioned above,\r\nrefers to interrogations; and _comparatio vel electio_ which of\r\ncourse is elections. Thus the second and third parts of this _Book of\r\nThree General Judgments_ deal with the same subjects as the second\r\nand third books of the work in four parts, which makes it difficult\r\nto distinguish them. I am inclined to think that in those manuscripts\r\nwhere the _Book of Three General Judgments_ seems an integral part\r\nof the work in four parts, we really have simply the first of the\r\nfour parts, followed by the _Book of Three General Judgments_.[542]\r\nAt any rate it seems clear that most of Roger’s astrological\r\ncomposition is on the theme of interrogations and elections. _Iudicia\r\nHerefordensis_,[543] found in more than one manuscript, may come from a\r\nfourth work of his or be portions of the foregoing works.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Summary.]\r\n\r\nIn this chapter we have treated of two Englishmen of the latter half\r\nof the twelfth century who are not generally known.[544] They were\r\nnot, however, without influence, as we have already shown in the case\r\nof Daniel of Morley and as the number of manuscripts of the works of\r\nRoger of Hereford sufficiently attests for him. Daniel and Roger show\r\nthat the same interest in astrology and astronomy from Arabic sources\r\nprevails at the close of the century in England as at its beginning in\r\nthe cases of Walcher, prior of Malvern, and Adelard of Bath. Daniel,\r\nlike Adelard, illustrates the relation of science to Christian thought;\r\nRoger, like Walcher, is an astronomer who makes and carefully records\r\nobservations of his own,[545] while he trusts in astrology as based\r\nupon experience. As Alfred of England dedicated his translation of the\r\npseudo-Aristotelian _De vegetabilibus_ to Roger, so he dedicated his\r\n_De motu cordis_ (_On the Motion of the Heart_) to a third Englishman,\r\nAlexander Neckam, to whom we turn in the next chapter for a picture\r\nof the state of science and his work _On the Natures of Things_ (_De\r\nnaturis rerum_) in his time.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[496] Fol. 88r.\r\n\r\n[497] Fols. 88v-89r.\r\n\r\n[498] Fol. 95v.\r\n\r\n[499] Fol. 96.\r\n\r\n[500] Fol. 94v.\r\n\r\n[501] Fol. 89v.\r\n\r\n[502] Fol. 95v.\r\n\r\n[503] Fol. 93v.\r\n\r\n[504] Fols. 95r-96.\r\n\r\n[505] Fol. 92r.\r\n\r\n[506] Fol. 101v.\r\n\r\n[507] Fol. 100v.\r\n\r\n[508] _Idem._\r\n\r\n[509] Fol. 99v.\r\n\r\n[510] Fol. 102v.\r\n\r\n[511] Fol. 102r.\r\n\r\n[512] Fol. 100v.\r\n\r\n[513] _De sensu et sensato_ at fols. 97r and 98v; _De coelo et mundo_,\r\n_ibid._; _De auditu naturali_, fol. 97r.

For instance, the next chapter in the\r\nprinted text is different, “De coniunctionibus planetarum, quae sunt\r\nnumero c.xx.” Unfortunately I have not been able to compare edition and\r\nmanuscript in detail. Both may represent texts of late date which have\r\nrearranged or added variously to the original, whether it be by John or\r\nRoger.

In Selden supra 76, the work in four parts begins at fol.\r\n3r, “Liber magistri Rogeri Hereford de iudiciis astronomicis.

In three books and a prologue, opening, “Quoniam circa tria\r\nfit omnis astronomica consideracio....” The question then arises,\r\ndo fol. 14v, “Incipit liber secundus de cogitatione. Sed quum iam\r\nde intentione et cogitatione tractandum...”; and fol. 18r, “Incipit\r\nliber tercius de electione vel operatione per quod fiat electio”; have\r\nreference to the last two books of _Three General Judgments_ or to the\r\ntwo middle books of the work in four parts? Apparently the former,\r\nsince there is no fourth part given; at fol. 20 seems to open another\r\ntreatise, _Liber de motibus planetarum_.\r\n\r\nMS E Musaeo 181 has the same arrangement as Selden supra 76, fols.\r\n10-18, but ends with the second book _De cogitacione_.

One was a\r\nfoster child; the other, her own son. During the next fifty years\r\nthese two boys were to become prominent in different fields. The fame\r\nof the one was to be unsurpassed on the battlefield and in the world\r\nof popular music and poetry. He was to become king of England, lord\r\nof half of France, foremost of knights and crusaders, and the idol of\r\nthe troubadours. He was Richard, Cœur de Lion. The other, in different\r\nfields and a humbler fashion, was none the less also to attain\r\nprominence; he was to be clerk and monk instead of king and crusader,\r\nand to win fame in the domain of Latin learning rather than Provençal\r\nliterature. This was Alexander Neckam. Of his happy childhood at St.\r\nAlbans he tells us himself in Latin verse somewhat suggestive of Gray’s\r\nlines on Eton:\r\n\r\n    _Hic locus aetatis nostrae primordia novit_\r\n    _Annos felices laetitiaeque dies_\r\n    _Hic locus ingenuis pueriles imbuit annos_\r\n    _Artibus et nostrae laudis origo fuit_,\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Education.]\r\n\r\nA number of years of his life were spent as teacher at Dunstable in a\r\nschool under the control of the monastery of St. Albans. It was at\r\nParis, however, that he received his higher education and also taught\r\nfor a while. Scarcely any place, he wrote late in life, was better\r\nknown to him than the city in whose schools he had been “a small\r\npillar” and where he “faithfully learned and taught the arts, then\r\nturned to the study of Holy Writ, heard lectures in Canon Law, and upon\r\nHippocrates and Galen, and did not find Civil Law distasteful.” This\r\npassage not only illustrates his own broad education in the liberal\r\narts, the two laws, medicine, and theology, but also suggests that\r\nthese four faculties were already formed or forming at Paris. Neckam\r\nvisited Italy, as his humorous poem bidding Rome good-by attests, and\r\nfrom two of the stories which he tells in _The Natures of Things_[546]\r\nwe may infer that he had been in Rouen and Meaux. In 1213 Neckam was\r\nelected abbot of Cirencester, and died in 1217. An amusing story is\r\ntold in connection with Neckam’s first becoming a monk. He is said to\r\nhave first applied for admission to a Benedictine monastery, but when\r\nthe abbot made a bad pun upon his good name, saying, _Si bonus es,\r\nvenias; si nequam, nequaquam_ (If you are a good man you may come; if\r\nNeckam, by no means), he joined the Augustinians instead.[547]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The state of learning.]\r\n\r\nNeckam gives us a glimpse of the learned world of his time as well\r\nas of his own education. He thinks past times happy, when he recalls\r\nthat “the greatest princes were diligent and industrious in aiding\r\ninvestigation of nature,” and that it was then commonly said, “An\r\nilliterate king is a crowned ass.”[548] But he is not ashamed of the\r\nschools of his own day. After speaking of the learning of Greece\r\nand Egypt in antiquity and stating that schools no longer flourish\r\nin those lands, he exclaims, “But what shall I say of Salerno and\r\nMontpellier where the diligent skill of medical students, serving the\r\npublic welfare, provides remedies to the whole world against bodily\r\nills? Italy arrogates to itself proficiency in the civil law, but\r\ncelestial scripture and the liberal arts prefer Paris to all other\r\ncities as their home. And in accord with Merlin’s prophecy the wisdom\r\nnow flourishes at Oxford which in his time was in process of transfer\r\nto Ireland.”[549] Neckam’s assertion that there were no schools\r\nin the Greece and Egypt of his day is interesting as implying the\r\ninsignificance of Byzantine and Mohammedan learning in the second half\r\nof the twelfth century. He perhaps does not think of Constantinople as\r\nin “Greece,” but in Egypt he must certainly include Cairo, where the\r\nmosque el-Azhar, devoted in 988 to educational purposes, “has been ever\r\nsince one of the chief universities of Islam.”[550] At any rate it is\r\nclear that to his mind the intellectual supremacy has now passed to\r\nwestern Europe.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Popular science and mechanical arts.]\r\n\r\nIn his praises of learning Neckam is a little too inclined, like many\r\nother Latin writers, to speak slightingly of the _vulgus_ or common\r\ncrowd. In antiquity, he affirms, the liberal arts were the monopoly\r\nof free men; mechanical or adulterine arts were for the ignoble.[551]\r\nThis does not mean, however, that his eyes are closed to the value of\r\npractical inventions, since both in _The Natures of Things_ and his\r\n_De utensilibus_ we find what are perhaps the earliest references to\r\nthe mariner’s compass[552] and to glass mirrors.[553] Indeed, he often\r\nentertains us with popular gossip and superstition, mentioning for\r\nthe first time the belief in a man in the moon,[554] and telling such\r\nstories of daily life as that of the lonely sailor whose dog helped\r\nhim reef the sails and manage the ropes of the boat in crossing the\r\nChannel,[555] or of the sea-fowl whose daily cry announced to the sheep\r\nin the tidal meadow that it was time to seek higher pasture, until one\r\nday its beak was caught by the shell of an oyster it tried to devour\r\nand the sheep were drowned for lack of warning.[556]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: His works.]\r\n\r\nNeckam’s writings were numerous, and, as might have been expected\r\nfrom his wide studies, in varied fields. They include grammatical\r\ntreatises,[557] works on Ovid and classical mythology, commentaries\r\nupon the books of the Bible such as the Psalms and Song of Songs, and\r\nthe writings of Aristotle, and other works of a literary, scientific,\r\nor theological character.[558] Most of them, however, if extant, are\r\nstill in manuscript. Only a few have been printed;[559] among them is\r\n_The Natures of Things_ which we shall presently consider.\r\n\r\nNeckam is a good illustration of the humanistic movement in the twelfth\r\ncentury. He wrote Latin verse[560] as well as prose; took pains with\r\nand pride in his Latin style; and shows acquaintance with a large\r\nnumber of classical authors. He had some slight knowledge, at least, of\r\nHebrew. He was especially addicted, according to Wright,[561] to those\r\ningenious but philologically absurd derivations of words in which the\r\n_Etymologies_ of Isidore of Seville had dealt, explaining, for example,\r\nthe Latin word for corpse (_cadaver_) as compounded from the three\r\nroots seen in the words for flesh (_caro_), given (_data_), to worms\r\n(_vermibus_). Yet in one chapter of _The Natures of Things_ Neckam\r\nattacks “the verbal cavils” and use of obsolete words in his time\r\nas “useless and frivolous,” and asks if one cannot be a good jurist\r\nor physician or philosopher without all this linguistic and verbal\r\ndisplay.[562] Wright, moreover, was also impressed by Neckam’s interest\r\nin natural science, calling him “certainly one of the most remarkable\r\nEnglish men of science in the twelfth century,”[563] and noting that\r\n“he not infrequently displays a taste for experimental science.”[564]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _De naturis rerum._]\r\n\r\n_The Natures of Things_, however, is not primarily a scientific or\r\nphilosophical dissertation, as Alexander is careful to explain in the\r\npreface, but a vehicle for moral instruction. Natural phenomena are\r\ndescribed, but following each comes some moral application or spiritual\r\nallegory thereof. The spots on the moon, for instance, are explained\r\nby some as due to mountains and to depressions which the sun’s light\r\ncannot reach, by others as due to the greater natural obscurity of\r\nportions of the moon. Neckam adds that they are for our instruction,\r\nshowing how even the heavenly bodies were stained by the sin of our\r\nfirst parents, and reminding us that during this present life there\r\nwill always be some blot upon holy church, but that when all the\r\nplanets and stars shall stand as it were justified, our state too will\r\nbecome stable, and both the material moon and holy church will be\r\nspotless before the Lamb.[565] Neckam intends to admire God through\r\nHis creatures and in so doing humbly to kiss as it were the feet of\r\nthe Creator. Despite this religious tone and the moralizing, Wright\r\nregarded the work “as an interesting monument of the history of science\r\nin western Europe and especially in England during the latter half\r\nof the twelfth century,”[566] and as such we shall consider it. That\r\nit was written before 1200 is to be inferred from a quotation from it\r\nby a chronicler of John’s reign.[567] It seems to have been the best\r\nknown of Neckam’s works. The brevity of _The Natures of Things_, which\r\nconsists of but two books, if we omit the other three of its five books\r\nwhich consist of commentaries upon _Genesis_ and _Ecclesiastes_, hardly\r\nallows us to call it an encyclopedia; but its title and arrangement by\r\ntopics and chapters closely resemble the later works which are usually\r\nspoken of as medieval encyclopedias. Later in life Neckam wrote a\r\npoetical paraphrase of it with considerable changes, which is entitled\r\n_De laudibus divinae sapientiae_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Neckam’s citations.]\r\n\r\nThe citations of authorities in the _De naturis rerum_ are of much\r\ninterest. A number of references to the law books of Justinian show\r\nNeckam’s knowledge of the Roman law,[568] and, as we should expect\r\nafter hearing of his commentary upon Ovid’s _Metamorphoses_, allusions\r\nto that work, the _Fasti_, and the _Ars amandi_ are frequent. Claudian\r\nis once quoted for two solid pages and considerable use is made\r\nof other Latin poets such as Vergil, Lucan, Martial, and Juvenal.\r\nNeckam believed that the diligent investigator could find much that\r\nwas useful in the inventions of the poets and that beneath their\r\nfables moral instruction sometimes lay hid.[569] Neckam quotes Plato,\r\nperhaps indirectly, and repeats in different words the fable of the\r\ncrow and fox, as given in Apuleius.[570] The church fathers are of\r\ncourse utilized--Augustine, Jerome, Gregory, Basil, and a more recent\r\ntheologian like Anselm, archbishop of Canterbury; and familiarity is\r\nshown with the early medieval standard authorities, such as Boethius,\r\nCassiodorus, Bede, and Isidore. Of writers who may be regarded as\r\ndealing more particularly with natural science there are mentioned\r\nPliny and Solinus on animals--but he seems to use Pliny very little\r\nand Solinus a great deal, Macer and Dioscorides on the properties\r\nand effects of herbs,[571] while works in the domain of astronomy\r\nor astrology are attributed to Julius (perhaps really Firmicus) and\r\nAugustus Caesar as well as to Ptolemy.[572]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: His knowledge of Aristotle.]\r\n\r\nBut what is most impressive is the frequent citation from Euclid and\r\nAristotle, especially the latter. Not only the logical treatises\r\nare cited, but also the _History of Animals_[573] and the _Liber\r\nCoeli et Mundi_, while allusion is also made to Aristotle’s opinions\r\nconcerning vision, motion, melancholy, waters, and various astronomical\r\nmatters.[574] Such passages--as well as the fact that commentaries\r\non Aristotle are ascribed to Neckam--suggest that Roger Bacon was\r\nmistaken in the much-quoted passage in which he states that the works\r\nof Aristotle on natural philosophy were first introduced to the\r\nmedieval (Latin) learned world in Latin translations by Michael Scot\r\nabout 1230. Neckam perhaps cites the _History of Animals_ indirectly:\r\nat any rate he makes little use of it; but his numerous mentions\r\nof Aristotle’s views on nature make it evident that “the truth of\r\nAristotelian” doctrine is already known in the twelfth century. And he\r\nalready regards “the most acute Aristotle” as the pre-eminent authority\r\namong all philosophers. After stating that “all philosophers generally\r\nseem to teach” that the planets move in a contrary direction to the\r\nfirmament like flies walking on a rushing wheel, Neckam adds a number\r\nof objections to this view, and adds, “It therefore was the opinion\r\nof Aristotle, the most acute, that the planets moved only with the\r\nfirmament.” He then expresses his amazement that the other philosophers\r\nshould have dared to oppose Aristotle, should have presumed to set\r\ntheir opinions against so great a philosopher. It is as if a peacock\r\nspread its spotted tail in rivalry with the starry sky, or as if owls\r\nand bats should vie with the eagle’s unblinking eye in staring at the\r\nmid-day sun.[575]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Use of recent authors.]\r\n\r\nThat Neckam had some acquaintance with Arabic and Jewish writers is\r\nindicated by his citing Alfraganus and Isaac. Of Christian writers\r\nof the century before him Neckam quotes from Hildebert, and four\r\ntimes from Bernard Silvester. He cites the _Pantegni_ or _Tegni_\r\nof Constantinus Africanus more than once.[576] He does not mention\r\nAdelard of Bath by name but in discussing experiments with vacuums\r\nrepeats the experiment of the water jar. In another chapter he states\r\nthat, if the earth were perforated, an enormous weight of lead would\r\nfall only to the center. Neckam’s chapter on “Why in the same earth\r\nplants grow of contrary effects” is similar to the third chapter of the\r\n_Natural Questions_ of Adelard, and his chapter on “Why certain animals\r\nruminate” is like Adelard’s seventh in the same work.[577]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Contemporary opinion of Neckam.]\r\n\r\nRoger Bacon, whose estimates of his contemporaries have sometimes been\r\naccepted at too high a value, wrote of Neckam some fifty years after\r\nAlexander’s death: “This Alexander wrote true and useful books on many\r\nsubjects, but he cannot with justice be named as an authority.”[578]\r\nBacon himself, however, seems on at least one occasion to have used\r\nNeckam as an authority without naming him.[579] On the other hand,\r\nanother Englishman of note in science, Alfred of Sarchel or Sareshel,\r\ndedicated his book on The Movement of the Heart (_De motu cordis_) to\r\nNeckam.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: His attitude toward natural science.]\r\n\r\nWhatever Neckam’s own scientific attainments may have been, there can\r\nbe no doubt that he had a high regard for scientia and that he was not\r\nwanting in sympathetic appreciation of the scientific spirit. This\r\nfact shines out in the pages of the _De naturis rerum_ amid its moral\r\nlessons and spiritual illustrations, its erroneous etymologies and\r\npopular anecdotes. “Science is acquired,” he says in one passage, “at\r\ngreat expense, by frequent vigils, by great expenditure of time, by\r\nsedulous diligence of labor, by vehement application of mind.”[580]\r\nBut its acquisition abundantly justifies itself even in practical life\r\nand destructive war. “What craftiness of the foe is there that does\r\nnot yield to the precise knowledge of those who have tracked down the\r\nelusive subtleties of things hidden in the very bosom of nature?”[581]\r\nHe often cites these experts in natural science, whom he always seems\r\nto regard with respect as authorities.[582] Not that he believes that\r\nthey have solved all problems. Some things forsooth are so hidden\r\nthat it seems as if Nature is saying, “This is my secret, this is my\r\nsecret!”[583] On the other hand, there are many natural phenomena too\r\nfamiliar through daily use and experience to need mention in books,\r\nsince even those who do not read are acquainted with them. Neckam\r\nconsequently will follow a middle course in selecting the contents of\r\nhis volume.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Science and the Bible.]\r\n\r\nAlthough a Christian clergyman, Neckam seems to experience little\r\ndifficulty in adopting the scientific theories of Aristotle; or, if\r\nthere are Aristotelian doctrines known to him with which he disagrees,\r\nhe usually quietly disregards them.[584] But he does raise the question\r\nseveral times of the correctness of Biblical statements concerning\r\nnature. He explains that Adam’s body was composed of all four elements\r\nand not made merely from earth, as the account of creation in the Book\r\nof Genesis might seem to imply.[585] And of the scriptural assertion\r\nthat “God made two great lights” he says, “The historical narrative\r\nfollows the judgment of the eye and the popular notion,” but of course\r\nthe moon is not one of the largest planets.[586] In a third chapter\r\nentitled, “That water is not lower than earth,” he notes that the\r\nstatement of the prophet that “God founded the earth upon the waters”\r\ndoes not agree with Alfraganus’ dictum that there is one sphere of\r\nearth and waters.[587] Wright quite unreasonably interprets this\r\nchapter as showing “to what a degree science had become the slave\r\nof scriptural phraseology.”[588] What it really shows is just the\r\ncontrary, for even the Biblical expositors, Neckam tells us, say that\r\nthe passage is to be taken in the sense that one speaks of Paris as\r\nlocated on the Seine. Neckam then makes a suggestion of his own, that\r\nwhat is really above the waters is the terrestrial paradise, since it\r\nis even beyond the sphere of the moon, and Enoch, translated thither,\r\nsuffered no inconvenience whatever from the waters of the deluge.\r\nMoreover, the terrestrial paradise symbolizes the church which is\r\nfounded on the waters of baptism. All of which is of course far-fetched\r\nand fanciful, but in no way can be said to make science “the slave\r\nof scriptural phraseology.” On the contrary it makes scriptural\r\nphraseology the slave of mysticism, while it subjects Enoch’s\r\ntranslation to somewhat material limitations. Possibly there may be\r\nused here some of the apocryphal books current under Enoch’s name.[589]\r\nOn one occasion Neckam does accept a statement of the Bible which\r\nseems inconsistent with the views of philosophers concerning the four\r\nelements. This is the assertion that after the day of judgment there\r\nwill be neither fire nor water but only air and earth will be left. To\r\nan imaginary philosopher who seems unwilling to accept this assertion\r\nNeckam says, “If you don’t believe me, at least believe Peter, the\r\nchief of the apostles, who says the same in his canonical epistle.\r\nSays what? Says that fire and water will not exist after the judgment\r\nday.”[590] But if Neckam prefers to believe his Bible as to what will\r\noccur in the world of nature after the day of judgment, he prefers\r\nalso, as we have seen, to follow natural science in regard to present\r\nnatural phenomena. Moreover, in neither the canonical nor apocryphal\r\nbooks can I find any such statement in the Epistles of Peter as Neckam\r\nhere credits him with, unless after the elements have melted with\r\nfervent heat, the new heavens and a new earth are to be interpreted as\r\nmade respectively of air and earth!\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: His own knowledge of science.]\r\n\r\nWe may agree at least with Wright that Neckam’s scientific attainments\r\nare considerable for his time. In physics and astronomy he shows\r\nhimself fairly well versed. He knows something of vacuums and\r\nsyphoning; he argues that water tends naturally to take a spherical\r\nshape;[591] he twice points out that the walls of buildings should not\r\nbe exactly parallel, since they should ultimately meet, if prolonged\r\nfar enough, at the center of the earth;[592] and he asserts that the\r\nso-called “antipodes” are no more under our feet than we are under\r\ntheirs.[593] He gives us what is perhaps our earliest information of\r\nsome medieval inventions, such as the mariner’s compass and mirrors\r\nof glass.[594] But he does not attempt to explain differences in the\r\nimages in convex and concave mirrors.[595] He is modest in regard to\r\nhis biological attainments, saying that he “is not ashamed to confess”\r\nthat there are species of which he does not even know the names, to say\r\nnothing of their natures.[596] But when Wright calls Neckam’s account\r\nof animals “a mere compilation” and says that “much of it is taken\r\nfrom the old writers, such as Solinus, Isidore, and Cassiodorus,”[597]\r\nhe is basing his conclusion simply on the fact that marginal notes in\r\nthe medieval manuscripts themselves ascribe a number of passages to\r\nthese authors. This ascription is correct. But there are many passages\r\non animals where the manuscripts name no authorities, and with one\r\nexception--the chapter on the hyena from Solinus--Wright fails to name\r\nany source from which Neckam has borrowed these other passages. It\r\nis easy to show that Neckam is a compiler when he himself or others\r\nhave stated his authorities but it is equally fair to suppose that he\r\nis honest and original when he cites no authorities or has not been\r\ndetected in borrowing. And he sometimes criticizes or discriminates\r\nbetween the earlier writers. After quoting Bernard Silvester’s\r\nstatement that the beaver castrates itself to escape its hunters, he\r\nadds, “But those who are more reliably informed as to the natures of\r\nthings assert that Bernard has followed the ridiculous popular notion\r\nand not reached the true fact.”[598] Neckam also questions the belief\r\nthat a lynx has such keen sight that it can see through nine walls.\r\nThis is supposed to have been demonstrated experimentally by observing\r\na lynx with nine walls between it and a person carrying some raw meat.\r\nThe lynx will move along its side of the walls whenever the meat is\r\nmoved on the other side and will stop opposite the spot where the\r\nperson carrying the meat stops. Neckam does not question the accuracy\r\nof this absurd experiment, but remarks that some natural scientists\r\nattribute it rather to the animal’s sense of smell than to its power of\r\nvision.[599]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Incredible stories of animals.]\r\n\r\nBut as a rule Neckam’s treatment of animals is far more credulous\r\nthan sceptical. He believes that the barnacle bird is generated from\r\nfir-wood which has been soaked in the salt water for a long time,[600]\r\nand that the wren, after it has been killed and is being roasted, turns\r\nitself on the spit.[601] He tells a number of delightful but incredible\r\nstories in which animals display remarkable sagacity and manifest\r\nemotions and motives similar to those of human beings. Some of these\r\ntales concern particular pets or wild beasts; others are of the habits\r\nof a species. The hawk, for example, keeps warm on wintry nights by\r\nseizing some other bird in its claws and holding it tight against its\r\nown body; but when day returns it gratefully releases this bird and\r\nsatisfies its morning appetite upon some other victim.[602] Neckam\r\nalso shares the common belief that animals were acquainted with the\r\nmedicinal virtues of herbs. When the weasel is wounded by a venomous\r\nanimal, it hastens to seek salubrious plants. For “educated by nature,\r\nit knows the virtues of herbs, although it has neither studied medicine\r\nat Salerno nor been drilled in the schools at Montpellier.”[603]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A chapter on the cock.]\r\n\r\nNeckam’s chapter on the barnyard cock perhaps will illustrate the\r\ndivergences between medieval and modern science as well as any other.\r\nAs a rooster approaches old age, he sometimes lays an egg upon which a\r\ntoad sits, and from which is hatched the basilisk. How is it that the\r\ncock “distinguishes the hours by his song”? From great heat ebullition\r\nof the humors within the said bird arises, it produces saltiness, the\r\nsaltiness causes itching, from the itching comes tickling, from the\r\ntickling comes delectation, and delectation excites one to song. Now\r\nnature sets certain periods to the movements of humors and therefore\r\nthe cock crows at certain hours. But why have roosters crests and hens\r\nnot? This is because of their very moist brains and the presence near\r\nthe top of their heads of some bones which are not firmly joined. So\r\nthe gross humor arising from the humidity escapes through the openings\r\nand produces the crest.[604]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Effect of sin upon nature.]\r\n\r\nNeckam harbored the notion, which we met long before in the pagan\r\nPhilostratus, in the Hebraic Enoch literature, in the Christian\r\n_Pseudo-Clementines_ and Basil’s _Hexaemeron_, and more recently in the\r\nwritings of Hildegard, that man’s sin has its physical effects upon\r\nnature. To Adam’s fall he attributes not only the spots on the moon but\r\nthe wildness of most animals, and the existence of insects to plague,\r\nand venomous animals to poison, and diseases to injure mankind.[605]\r\nBut for the fall of man, moreover, all living creatures would be\r\nsubsisting upon a vegetarian diet.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Neckam on occult virtues.]\r\n\r\nMagic is hardly mentioned in the _De naturis rerum_. In a passage,\r\nhowever, telling how Aristotle ordered some of his subtlest works to\r\nbe buried with him, Neckam adds that he so guarded the neighborhood of\r\nhis sepulcher “by some mysterious force of nature or power of art, not\r\nto say feat of the magic art, that no one in those days could enter\r\nit.”[606] But Neckam is a believer in occult virtues and to a certain\r\nextent in astrology. He would also seem to believe in the force of\r\nincantations from his assertion that “in words and herbs and stones\r\ndiligent investigators of nature have discovered great virtue. Most\r\ncertain experience, moreover, makes our statement trustworthy.”[607]\r\nHe mentions a much smaller number of stones than Marbod, but ascribes\r\nthe same occult virtues to those which he does name. In the preface\r\nto his first book he says that some gems have greater virtue when set\r\nin silver than when set in gold. A tooth separated from the jaw of\r\na wild boar remains sharp only as long as the animal remains alive,\r\nan interesting bit of sympathetic magic.[608] The occult property of\r\ntaming wild bulls possessed by the fig-tree which we have already seen\r\nnoted by various authors is also remarked by Neckam.[609] A moonbeam\r\nshining through a narrow aperture in the wall of a stable fell directly\r\non a sore on a horse’s back and caused the death of a groom standing\r\nnearby. Out-of-doors the effect would not have been fatal, since the\r\nforce of the moon’s rays would not have been so concentrated upon one\r\nspot and the humidity would have had a better chance to diffuse through\r\nspace.[610]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fascination.]\r\n\r\nAfter telling of the fatal glances of the basilisk and wolf, Neckam\r\nsays that fascination is explained as due to evil rays from someone who\r\nlooks at you. He adds that nurses lick the face of a child who has been\r\nfascinated.[611]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: His limited belief in astrology.]\r\n\r\nNeckam will not believe that the seven planets are animals.[612] He\r\ndoes believe, however, that they not merely adorn the heavens but exert\r\nupon inferiors those effects which God has assigned to them.[613] Each\r\nplanet rules in turn three hours of the day. As there are twenty-four\r\nhours in all, the last three hours of each day are governed by the same\r\nplanet which ruled the first three. Hence the names of the days in the\r\nplanetary week, Sunday being the day when the sun governs the first\r\nthree and last three hours, Monday the day when the moon controls the\r\nopening and closing hours of day, and so on.[614] But the stars do not\r\nimpose necessity upon the human will which remains free. Nevertheless\r\nthe planet Mars, for instance, bestows the gift of counsel; and science\r\nis associated with the planet Venus which is hot and moist, as are\r\npersons of sanguine temperament in whom science is wont to flourish.\r\nNeckam also associates each of the seven planets which illuminate the\r\nuniverse with one of the seven liberal arts which shed light on all\r\nknowledge.[615] He alludes to the great year of which the philosophers\r\ntell, when after 36,000 years the stars complete their courses,[616]\r\nand to the music of the spheres when, to secure the perfect consonance\r\nof an octave, the eighth sphere of the fixed stars completes the\r\nharmony of the seven planets. But he fears that someone may think he\r\nis raving when he speaks with the philosophers of this harmony of the\r\neight spheres.[617]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Neckam’s farewell.]\r\n\r\nAt Jesus College, Oxford, in a manuscript of the early thirteenth\r\ncentury, which is exclusively devoted to religious writings by\r\nNeckam,[618] there occurs at the close an address of the author to his\r\nwork, which is in the same hand as the rest of the manuscript, which\r\nwe may therefore not unreasonably suppose to have been Neckam’s own\r\nwriting. As he is spoken of in the manuscript as abbot of Cirencester,\r\nperhaps these are also actually the last words he wrote. We may\r\ntherefore appropriately terminate our account of Neckam by quoting them.\r\n\r\n“Perchance, O book, you will survive Alexander, and worms will eat\r\nme before the book-worm gnaws you; for my body is due the worms and\r\nbook-worms will demolish you. You are the mirror of my soul, the\r\ninterpreter of my meditations, the surest index of my meaning, the\r\nfaithful messenger of my mind’s emotions, the sweet comforter of my\r\ngrief, the true witness of my conscience. To you as faithful depositary\r\nI have confided my heart’s secrets; you restore faithfully to me those\r\nthings which I have committed to your trust; in you I read myself. You\r\nwill come, you will come into the hands of some pious reader who will\r\ndeign to pour forth prayers for me. Then indeed, little book, you will\r\nprofit your master; then you will recompense your Alexander by a most\r\ngrateful interchange. There will come, nor do I begrudge my labor,\r\nthe devotion of a pious reader, who will now let you repose in his\r\nlap, now move you to his breast, sometimes place you as a sweet pillow\r\nbeneath his head, sometimes gently closing you with glad hands, he will\r\nfervently pray for me to Lord Jesus Christ, who with Father and Holy\r\nSpirit lives and reigns God through infinite cycles of ages. Amen.”\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[546] I, 37 and II, 158.\r\n\r\n[547] For references to the sources for the above facts of Neckam’s\r\nlife see the first few pages of the preface to Thomas Wright’s edition\r\nof the _De naturis rerum_, and the _De laudibus divinae sapientiae_,\r\nin _Rerum Britannicarum Medii Aevi Scriptores_, vol. 34, London, 1863.\r\nAll references in this chapter, unless otherwise noted, will be to this\r\nvolume, and to the book and chapter of the _De naturis rerum_.\r\n\r\n[548] II, 21.\r\n\r\n[549] II, 174.\r\n\r\n[550] S.

It is of the 13th century according\r\nto the catalogue and contains this interesting inscription, “Hic est\r\nliber S. Albani quam qui abstulerit aut titulum deleverit anathema\r\nsit.

Ut docet Aristoteles, omnia mula sterilis est.\r\nWhile the substance of these two passages is found in Pliny’s _Natural\r\nHistory_, he does not mention Aristotle in these connections nor use\r\nthe Greek word “narcos.” Moreover, Neckam seems to give credit as a\r\nrule to his immediate sources and not to copy their citations; as we\r\nhave seen, he credited the fable of the fox and crow to Apuleius and\r\nnot to Aesop to whom Apuleius credits it.\r\n\r\n[574] II, 153.

Placuit itaque acutissimo\r\nAristoteli planetas tantum cum firmamento moveri. Sed quid?

Professor\r\nHaskins, however, believes that the new Aristotle was by this time\r\npenetrating England, but gives the main credit for this to Alfredus\r\nAnglicus or Alfred of Sareshel, the author of the _De motu cordis_,\r\nand the translator of the Pseudo-Aristotelian _De vegetabilibus_ and\r\nof an appendix to the _Meteorologica_ consisting of three chapters _De\r\ncongelatis_, also translated from the Arabic. Alfred was no isolated\r\nfigure in English learning, since he dedicated the _De vegetabilibus_\r\nto Roger of Hereford and the _De motu cordis_ to Neckam: ed. Baruch,\r\nInnsbruck, 1878; and see Baeumker, _Die Stellung des Alfred von\r\nSareshel ... in der Wissenschaft des beginnenden XIII Jahrts., München,\r\nSitzber_. (1913), No. 9. On the whole it is probably safe to assume\r\nthat his knowledge of Aristotle was soon at least, if not from the\r\nstart, shared with others. Grabmann (1916), pp. 22-25, adds nothing new\r\non the subject of Neckam’s knowledge of Aristotle.\r\n\r\n[576] I, 39; II, 11; I, 49; II, 129, 140, 157; II, 157 and 161.\r\n\r\n[577] I, 19; I, 16; II, 57; II, 162.\r\n\r\n[578] Fr.

From about 1165 on Maimonides\r\nseems to have lived most of the time at Cairo and there to have done\r\nmost of his work. After the deaths of his father and brother forced him\r\nto earn a livelihood by practicing medicine, he became physician to the\r\nvizier of Saladin and head of the Jewish community in Cairo.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: His works in the west.]\r\n\r\nWhether or not he returned to Spain before his death in 1204, he was\r\ncertainly known to the western world of learning. In 1194 he wrote a\r\nletter on the subject of astrology in response to inquiries which he\r\nhad received from Jews of Marseilles.[622] In it he tells them that his\r\n_Repetition of the Law_ (_Iteratio legis_) has already spread through\r\nthe island of Sicily. But he apparently was still in Cairo, where in\r\nJuly, 1198, he wrote his treatise on Poisons for the Cadi Fadhil.[623]\r\nAfter his death, however, it was between the conservative and liberal\r\nparties among the Jews of France and Spain that a struggle ensued over\r\nthe orthodoxy of his works, which was finally settled, we are told,\r\nby reference in 1234 to the Christian authorities, who ordered his\r\nbooks to be burned. His _Guide for the Perplexed_, first published\r\nin Egypt in Arabic in 1190, had been translated into Hebrew at Lunel\r\nin southern France before the close of the twelfth century, and then\r\nagain by a Spanish poet.[624] But the rabbis of northern France opposed\r\nthe introduction of Maimonides’ works there and, when they were\r\nanathematized for it by those of the south, are said to have reported\r\nthe writings to the Inquisition. The Maimonist party then accused them\r\nof delation and several of them were punished by having their tongues\r\ncut out.[625]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: His works in Latin.]\r\n\r\nIf certain Christian authorities really did thus burn the books of\r\nMaimonides, their action was unavailing to check the spread of his\r\nwritings even in Christian lands, and certainly was not characteristic\r\nof the attitude of Christian Latin learning in general. _The Guide of\r\nthe Perplexed_ had already been translated into Latin before 1234,[626]\r\nand we find Moses of Cordova cited by such staunch churchmen as\r\nAlexander of Hales, Albertus Magnus,[627] Thomas Aquinas, and Vincent\r\nof Beauvais. It was for Pope Clement V himself that Ermengard Blasius\r\nof Montpellier translated at Barcelona Maimonides’ work on Poisons at\r\nthe beginning of the fourteenth century from Arabic into Latin.[628]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Attitude to science and religion.]\r\n\r\nIt was not surprising that Albert and Aquinas should cite Maimonides,\r\nfor he did for Jewish thought what they attempted for Christian,\r\nnamely, the reconciliation of Aristotle and the Bible, philosophy and\r\nwritten revelation. If he anteceded them in this and perhaps to some\r\nextent showed them the way, we must remember that William of Conches,\r\nwho was earlier than he, had already faced this difficulty of the\r\nrelations between science and religion, the scriptures and the writings\r\nof the philosophers, although he of course did not know all the books\r\nof Aristotle. As for Maimonides, continuing the allegorical method of\r\nPhilo, he tried to discover in the Old Testament and Talmud all the\r\nAristotelian philosophy, and was convinced that the prophets of old had\r\nreceived further revelations of a philosophical character, which had\r\nbeen transmitted orally for a time but then lost during the periods\r\nof Jewish wandering and persecution.[629] He defended Moses from the\r\nslurs of Galen who had charged the lawgiver with an unscientific\r\nattitude.[630] He denied the eternity of matter[631] and of the\r\nheavens,[632] but held that the celestial bodies were living animated\r\nbeings and that the heavenly spheres were conscious and free.[633]\r\nHe spoke of belief in demons as “idle and fallacious,” holding that\r\nevil is mere privation and that the personal Devil of Scripture was\r\nan allegory for this, while the possession by demons was merely the\r\ndisease of melancholy.[634] Yet he believed that God does nothing\r\nwithout the mediation of an angel and that belief in the existence of\r\nangels is only second in importance to a belief in God.[635] Thus the\r\nrationalism and scepticism which modern Jewish admirers have ascribed\r\nto Maimonides had their decided limitations.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Attitude to magic.]\r\n\r\nAn interesting discussion of magic occurs in the _Guide for the\r\nPerplexed_[636] in connection with the precepts of the Mosaic law\r\nagainst idolatry. Maimonides holds that magicians and diviners are\r\nclosely akin to idolaters, and this part of his discussion is very\r\nsimilar to patristic treatments which we have already encountered.\r\nHe goes on, however, to say that astrology and magic were especially\r\ncharacteristic of the Chaldeans, Egyptians, and Canaanites, and to\r\ndistinguish three varieties of magic: one employing the properties of\r\nplants, animals and metals; a second determining the times when these\r\nworks should be performed; a third employing gesticulations, actions,\r\nand cries of the human operator himself. Thus he recognizes the three\r\nelements of materials, times, and rites in magic. He sees that they may\r\nbe combined in one operation, as when an herb is plucked when the moon\r\nis in a specified degree. He notes that magic is largely performed by\r\nwomen, towards whom men are more merciful than towards their own sex.\r\nHe also notes that magicians claim to do good or at least to ward off\r\nevils such as snakes and wild beasts or the blight from plants. But\r\nthe lawgiver forbade “all those practices which contrary to natural\r\nscience are said to produce utility by special and occult virtues and\r\nproperties, ... such forsooth as proceed not from a natural cause but\r\na magical operation and which rely upon the constellations to such a\r\ndegree as to involve worship and veneration of them.”[637]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Towards empiricism.]\r\n\r\nBut then Maimonides goes on to say that “everything is licit in which\r\nany natural cause appears.” And he goes farther than that. He says that\r\nthe reader need not feel uneasy because the rabbis have allowed the use\r\nin suspensions of a nail from the yoke worn by criminals or the tooth\r\nof a fox. “For in those times they placed faith in these things because\r\nthey were confirmed by experience and served in the place of medicine.”\r\nSimilarly in Maimonides’ own day Galen’s remedy of the suspension of a\r\npeony from the patient’s neck was employed in cases of epilepsy, dog’s\r\ndung was used against pustules and sore throat, and so forth. “For\r\nwhatever is proved by experience to be true, although no natural cause\r\nmay be apparent, its use is permitted, because it acts as a medicine.”\r\nThus he condemns magic, but approves of empirical medicine as well as\r\nof natural science, and evidently does not regard the employment of\r\noccult virtues as necessarily magical and forbidden.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Abuse of divine names.]\r\n\r\nIn another passage of the _Guide_ Maimonides cautions, however, against\r\nthe abuse of divine names, and, while he holds to the Tetragrammaton\r\n“which is written but is not pronounced as it is spelled,” deplores\r\nthe many inventions of meaningless and inefficacious names which\r\nsuperstitious and insane men have too often imposed upon the credulity\r\nof good men as possessed of peculiar sanctity and purity and having the\r\nvirtue of working miracles. He therefore warns his readers against such\r\n“amulets or experimental charts.”[638]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Occult virtue and empirical remedies in his work on poisons.]\r\n\r\nMaimonides again approves of empirical remedies and of occult virtues\r\nin his treatise on poisons. He holds that counter-poisons do not act by\r\nany physical or chemical quality but by their entire substance or by a\r\nspecial property.[639] Lemon pips, peeled and applied in a compress; a\r\npowdered emerald, which should be a beautiful green, quite transparent,\r\nand of good water; and the animal bezoar, which comes from the eyes or\r\ngall bladder of deer; these are antidotes whose efficacy is proved by\r\nincontestible experimentation. When _terra sigillata_ cannot be had,\r\na powdered emerald of the sort just described may be substituted for\r\nit as an ingredient in the grand theriac.[640] Maimonides believes\r\nthat this last named remedy is the outcome of experiments with vipers\r\ncarried on through the course of centuries by ancient philosophers\r\nand physicians.[641] As for the stone _bezoar_, the writings of the\r\nmoderns are full of marvelous tales concerning it, but Galen does not\r\nmention it, and Maimonides has tried all the varieties which he could\r\nobtain against scorpion bites without the least success. But experience\r\nconfirms the virtue of the _bezoar_ of animal origin, as has been\r\nstated. Maimonides’ observations concerning cures for the bites of mad\r\ndogs are interesting. He states that at first the bite of a mad dog\r\ndoes not feel any different from that of a dog who is not mad. He also\r\nwarns his readers not to trust to books to distinguish between the\r\ntwo, but unless they are sure that the dog was not mad, to keep on the\r\nsafe side by taking the remedies against the bite of a mad dog.[642]\r\nHe also states that all of the various remedies listed for the cure of\r\nthe bite of a mad dog must be employed before hydrophobia manifests\r\nitself, “for after the appearance of that symptom, I have never seen\r\na patient survive.”[643] In speaking of sucking the venom from a\r\nwound, Maimonides affirms that it is better to have this done by a\r\nfasting person, since the spittle of such a person is itself hostile to\r\npoisons.[644]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Attitude to astrology.]\r\n\r\nThat Maimonides was well acquainted with the art of astrology may be\r\ninferred from his assertion that he has read every book in Arabic on\r\nthe subject.[645] Maimonides not only believed that the stars were\r\nliving, animated beings and that there were as many pure intelligences\r\nas there were spheres,[646] but he states twice in the _Guide for the\r\nPerplexed_[647] that all philosophers agree that this inferior world\r\nof generation and corruption is ruled by the virtues and influences\r\nof the celestial spheres. While their influence is diffused through\r\nall things, each star or planet also has particular species especially\r\nunder its influence. According to Lévy[648] he further held not only\r\nthat the movement of the celestial sphere starts every motion in\r\nthe universe, but that every soul has its origin in the soul of the\r\ncelestial sphere. In his letter on astrology to the Jews of Marseilles\r\nhe repeats that all the philosophers have held, and that Hebrew masters\r\nof the past have agreed with them, that whatever is in this inferior\r\nworld the blessed God has brought about by that virtue which arises\r\nfrom the spheres and stars. As God performs signs and miracles by\r\nangels, so natural processes and operations by the spheres and stars\r\nwhich are animated and endowed with knowledge and science. All this\r\nis true and in no way derogates from the Jewish faith. But Maimonides\r\nregards as folly and not wisdom the doctrine found in Arabic works\r\nof astrology that a man’s nativity compels everything to happen to\r\nhim just as it does and in no otherwise. He regards this doctrine as\r\nderived from the Chaldeans, Egyptians, and Canaanites and makes the\r\nrather rash assertion that no Greek philosopher ever wrote a book of\r\nthis sort. This doctrine would make no distinction between a man whom\r\na lion meets and tears limb from limb and the mouse which a cat plays\r\nwith. It would make men warring for kingdoms no different from dogs\r\nfighting over a carcass. These illustrations may seem to the reader\r\nrather favorable to the doctrine which Maimonides is endeavoring to\r\ncombat, but he upholds human free will and man’s responsibility for his\r\nactions, which he declares are fundamental tenets of the Jewish law.\r\nFor some reason which is not clear to me he identifies the doctrine of\r\nnativities and the control of human destiny by the constellations with\r\nthe rule of blind chance and the happening of everything fortuitously,\r\nwhich would seem quite a different matter and third alternative.[649]\r\nMaimonides holds that God planned all human affairs beforehand, and\r\nthat just as He planned the course of nature so as to allow for the\r\noccurrence of miracles, so He planned human affairs in such a way\r\nthat men could be held responsible and punished for their sins.\r\nMaimonides regards the rule of chance and the doctrine of nativities as\r\nincompatible with this.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Divination and prophecy.]\r\n\r\nYet Maimonides believed in a human faculty of natural divination,\r\nstating that the ability to conjecture and divine is found in all men\r\nto some degree, and that in some imagination and divination are so\r\nstrong and sure that they correctly forecast all future events or the\r\ngreater part of them.[650] The difference between true prophets and\r\nthe diviners and observers of times “is that the observers of times,\r\ndiviners, and such men, some of their words may be fulfilled and some\r\nof them may not be fulfilled.”[651]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Marvels in the _Aphorisms_]\r\n\r\nIn his _Aphorisms_ which are drawn largely from the works of Galen\r\nMaimonides repeats many marvelous stories, instances of belief in\r\noccult virtue, and medical methods bordering upon the practice of\r\nmagic.[652] Most of these have already been mentioned in our chapters\r\nupon Galen and need not be reiterated here. It is perhaps worth noting\r\nthat Maimonides displays some critical sense as to the authenticity\r\nof works ascribed to Galen. He does not accept as his a treatise\r\nforbidding the burial of a man until twenty-four hours after his\r\nsupposed death, although the patriarch who translated it from Greek\r\ninto Arabic regarded it as Galen’s. Maimonides suggests that it may\r\nbe by some other Galen than the great physician “whose books are well\r\nknown.” Maimonides also notes that in the work of Hippocrates on female\r\nailments which Galen commented upon and Hunain translated there have\r\nbeen added many statements of a marvelous character by some third hand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[619] In English, besides the article on Maimonides in the _Jewish\r\nEncyclopedia_, there is a rather good essay by Rabbi Gottheil in\r\nWarner’s _Library of the World’s Best Literature_.

D., has preserved a\r\nsingle recipe for making gold from the alchemical poem, _The Paradise\r\nof Wisdom_, originally consisting of some 2315 verses and written by\r\nthe Ommiad prince, Khalid ibn Jazid (635-704 A. D.) of Alexandria.\r\nOther Arabic writers of the ninth and tenth centuries represent this\r\nprince as interested in natural science and medicine, alchemy and\r\nastrology, and as the first to promote translations from the Greek and\r\nCoptic. Thus the alchemistic _Book of Crates_ is said to have been\r\ntranslated either by him or under his direction. The _Fihrist_ further\r\nstates that Khalid was instructed in alchemy by one Morienes, who was\r\nhimself a disciple of Adfar.[653] There is still extant, but only in\r\nLatin translation, what purports to be the book of this same Morienes,\r\nor Morienus as he is called in Latin, addressed to this same Khalid.\r\nThe book cites or invents various Greek alchemists but claims the\r\nThrice-Great Hermes as its original author. It is of this work that we\r\nshall now treat as the first of a number of medieval Hermetic books.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Robert of Chester’s preface.]\r\n\r\nOne of the earliest treatises of alchemy translated from Arabic into\r\nLatin would appear to be this which Morienus Romanus, a hermit of\r\nJerusalem, edited for “Calid, king of the Egyptians,” and which Robert\r\nof Chester turned into Latin[654] on the eleventh day of February\r\nin the year 1182 of the Spanish era or 1144 A. D. Of Robert’s other\r\ntranslations we have spoken elsewhere.[655] He opens his preface to\r\nthe present treatise with an account of three Hermeses--Enoch, Noah,\r\nand the king, philosopher, and prophet who reigned in Egypt after the\r\nflood and was called Hermes Triplex. This account is very similar to\r\none which we shall presently find prefixed to an astrological treatise\r\nby Hermes Trismegistus. It was this Hermes, Robert continues, who\r\nrediscovered and edited all the arts and sciences after the deluge, and\r\nwho first found and published the present work, which is a book divine\r\nand most replete with divinity, and which is entitled, _The Book of the\r\nComposition of Alchemy_. “And since,” says Robert, “what alchemy is and\r\nwhat is its composition, your Latin world does not yet know truly,[656]\r\nI will elucidate the same in the present treatise.” Alchemy is that\r\nsubstance which joins the more precious bodies which are compounded\r\nfrom one original matter and by this same natural union converts them\r\nto the higher type. In other words, it is the philosopher’s stone by\r\nwhich metals may be transmuted. Although Robert is a relatively young\r\nman and his Latinity perhaps not of the best, he essays the task of\r\ntranslating this so great and important a work and reveals his own name\r\nin the preface lest some other person steal the fruits of his labor and\r\nthe praise which is his due. Lippmann dismisses the translation rather\r\ntestily as “surpassed by no later work for emptiness, confusion, and\r\nsheer drivel,”[657] but we shall attempt some further description.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The story of Morienus and Calid.]\r\n\r\nFollowing Robert’s preface comes an account, in the usual style of\r\napocryphal and occult works, told partly in the first person by\r\nMorienus and partly of him in the third person by someone else. Long\r\nafter Christ’s passion an Adfar of Alexandria found the book of Hermes,\r\nmastered it after long study, and himself gave forth innumerable\r\nprecepts which were spread abroad and finally reached the ears of\r\nMorienus, then a young man at Rome. This reminds us of the opening of\r\nthe _Recognitions_ of Clement. Morienus left his home, parents, and\r\nnative land, and hastened to Alexandria to the house of Adfar. When\r\nAdfar learned that Morienus was a Christian, he promised to divulge to\r\nhim “the secrets of all divinity,” which he had hitherto kept concealed\r\nfrom nearly everyone. When Adfar died, Morienus left Alexandria and\r\nbecame a hermit at Jerusalem. Not many years thereafter a king arose\r\nin Egypt named Macoya. He begat a son named Gezid who reigned after\r\nhis father’s death and in his turn begat a son named Calid who reigned\r\nafter his death. This Calid was a great patron of science and searched\r\nall lands for someone who could reveal this book of Hermes to him.\r\nMorienus was still living, and when a traveler brought him news of\r\nCalid and his desire, he came to his court, not for the sake of the\r\ngifts of gold which the king had offered, but in order to instruct him\r\nwith spiritual gifts. Saluting Calid with the words, “O good king,\r\nmay God convert you to a better,” he asked for a house or laboratory\r\nin which to prepare his masterpiece of perfection, but departed\r\nsecretly as soon as it was consummated. When Calid saw the gold which\r\nMorienus had made, he ordered the heads to be cut off of all the other\r\nalchemists whom he had employed for years, and grieved that the hermit\r\nhad left without revealing his secret.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The secret of the philosopher’s stone]\r\n\r\nMore years passed before Calid’s trusty slave, Galip, learned the\r\nidentity and whereabouts of Morienus from another hermit of Jerusalem\r\nand was despatched with a large retinue to bring him back. The king\r\nand the hermit at first engaged in a moral and religious discussion,\r\nand many days passed before Calid ventured to broach the subject of\r\nalchemy. He then put to Morienus a succession of questions, such as\r\nwhether there is one fundamental substance, and concerning the nature\r\nand color of the philosopher’s stone, also its natural composition,\r\nweight and taste, cheapness or expensiveness, rarity or abundance,\r\nand whether there is any other stone like unto it or which has its\r\neffect. This last query Morienus answered in the negative, since in\r\nthe philosopher’s stone are contained the four elements and it is\r\nlike unto the universe and the composition of the universe. In the\r\nprocess of obtaining it decay must come first, then purification. As in\r\nhuman generation, there must first be _coitus_, then conception, then\r\npregnancy, then birth, then nutrition. To such general observations\r\nand analogies, which are commonplaces of alchemy, are finally added\r\nseveral pages of specific directions as to alchemistic operations. Such\r\nenigmatic nomenclature is employed as “white smoke,” and “green lion,”\r\nbut Morienus later explains to Calid the significance of most of these\r\nphrases. “Green lion” is glass; “impure body” is lead; “pure body” is\r\ntin, and so on.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Later works of alchemy ascribed to Hermes.]\r\n\r\nIn so far as I have examined the alchemical manuscripts of the later\r\nmiddle ages,[658] which I have not done very extensively owing\r\nto the fact that most of them consist of anonymous and spurious\r\ncompositions which are probably of a later date than the period with\r\nwhich we are directly concerned,[659] I have hardly found as many\r\ntreatises ascribed to Hermes Trismegistus as might be expected.\r\nPerhaps as many works are ascribed to Aristotle, Geber, and other\r\nfamous names as to Hermes or Mercury. Thus out of some forty items in\r\nan alchemical miscellany of the fourteenth or fifteenth century[660]\r\ntwo are attributed to Hermes and Mercury, two to Aristotle, one to\r\nPlato, three to Geber, two to Albertus Magnus, and others to his\r\ncontemporaries like Roger Bacon, Brother Elias, Bonaventura, and\r\nArnald of Villanova. Of the two titles connected with Hermes one is\r\nsimply a _Book of Hermes_; the other, _A Treatise of Mercury to his\r\ndisciple Mirnesindus_. Other specimens of works ascribed to Hermes in\r\nmedieval Latin manuscripts are: _The Secrets of Hermes the philosopher,\r\ninventor of metals, according to the nature of transmutation_[661] or\r\nin another manuscript, “inventor of transformation,”[662] a treatise\r\non the fountain of youth by Trismegistus;[663] and a work on alcohol\r\nascribed to “father Hermes.”[664] The Early English Text Society has\r\nreprinted an English translation of the Latin treatise on the fifth\r\nessence “that Hermes, the prophet and king of Egypt, after the flood\r\nof Noah, father of philosophers, had by revelation of an angel of God\r\nto him sent,” which was first published “about 1460-1476 by Fred J.\r\nFurnival.”[665] “The book of Hermogenes” is also to be accredited to\r\nHermes Trismegistus.[666]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Medieval citations of Hermes]\r\n\r\nAmong the Arabs and in medieval Latin learning the reputation of\r\nHermes continued not only as an alchemist, but as a fountain of\r\nwisdom in general. Roger Bacon spoke of “Hermes Mercurius, the father\r\nof philosophers.”[667] Daniel of Morley we have heard cite works of\r\nTrismegistus and distinguish between “two most excellent authorities,”\r\nthe “great Mercury,” and his nephew, “Trismegistus Mercurius.”[668]\r\nAlbertus Magnus cited “The so-called _Sacred Book_ of Hermes to\r\nAsclepius,”[669] an astrological treatise of which the Greek version\r\nhas been mentioned in our earlier chapter on Hermes, Orpheus, and\r\nZoroaster. And Albert’s contemporary, William of Auvergne, bishop of\r\nParis, makes use several times[670] of the dialogue between Mercurius\r\nTrismegistus, “the Egyptian philosopher and magician,” and Asclepius\r\nfrom a _Liber de hellera_ or _De deo deorum_, which is presumably the\r\nGreek Ἱερὰ βίβλος. Trismegistus is represented as affirming that there\r\nis divine power in herbs and stones. In the _Speculum astronomiae_[671]\r\nAlbert listed a number of bad books on necromantic images[672] by\r\nHermes of which Christians were to beware: a book of images for each of\r\nthe seven planets, an eighth treatise following them, a work on _The\r\nseven rings of the seven planets_, a book of magical illusions (_liber\r\npraestigiorum_),[673] and a book addressed to Aristotle. William of\r\nAuvergne seems to allude to the same literature when he twice repeats\r\na story of two fallen angels from Hermes, citing his _Seven Planets_\r\nin one case and _Book of Venus_ in the other.[674] Albertus Magnus\r\nalso cites “books of incantations” by Hermes in his work on vegetables\r\nand plants;[675] and a _Liber Alcorath_ is ascribed to Hermes in the\r\n_Liber aggregationis_ or _Experimenta Alberti_ which is current under\r\nAlbert’s name. The astrologer Cecco d’Ascoli in the early fourteenth\r\ncentury cites a treatise by Hermes entitled _De speculis et luce_ (_Of\r\nmirrors and light_).[676] These few instances of medieval citation of\r\nHermes could of course be greatly multiplied but suffice to suggest the\r\nimportance of his name in the later history of magic and astrology as\r\nwell as of alchemy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Astrological treatises.]\r\n\r\nWe may, however, briefly examine some specimens of the works\r\nthemselves, chiefly, as in the citations, of a magical and astrological\r\ncharacter, which are current under Hermes’ name in the medieval\r\nmanuscripts. A treatise on fifteen stars, fifteen stones, fifteen\r\nherbs, and fifteen images to be engraved on the stones, is ascribed\r\nsometimes to Hermes and sometimes to Enoch.[677] The number fifteen\r\nis difficult to relate to planets, signs, or decans; in fact the\r\nfifteen stars are fixed stars supposed to exceed others in virtue.\r\nJohn Gower in the fourteenth century treated of the same subject in\r\nhis _Confessio amantis_.[678] In the middle ages a _Centiloquium_, or\r\nseries of brief astrological dicta, was ascribed to Hermes as well\r\nas to Ptolemy. Some manuscripts imply that the _Centiloquium_ of\r\nHermes was a selection from the astrological treatises of Hermes put\r\ntogether by Stephen of Messina for Manfred, king of Sicily.[679] In a\r\nfifteenth century manuscript is ascribed to Hermes a Latin astrological\r\ntreatise of considerable length opening with the thirty-six decans\r\nand their astrological influence[680] but dealing with various other\r\nmatters bearing upon the prediction of nativities; and a much briefer\r\nbut equally astrological work on _Accidents_, which we are told was\r\nrewritten by Haly before it was translated into Latin.[681] Two books\r\nof “Hermes the Philosopher” on the revolutions of nativities by some\r\nunspecified translator were printed by H. Wolf in 1559.[682] A work\r\non medical diagnosis of diseases from the stars without inspection of\r\nurine which is ascribed to Hermes in a Wolfenbüttel manuscript[683]\r\nwould probably turn out upon examination to be the treatise on that\r\ntheme of William of England.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Of the Six Principles of Things._]\r\n\r\nBy the thirteenth century, if not before, a treatise was in existence\r\nby “Hermes Mercurius Triplex” on the six principles of things[684]\r\nwith a prologue concerning the three Mercuries,[685] of whom we have\r\nalready heard Robert of Chester speak in his preface. Here too the\r\nfirst is identified with Enoch, the second with Noah, and the third is\r\ncalled triplex because he was at once king, philosopher, and prophet,\r\nruling Egypt after the flood with supreme equity, renowned in both the\r\nliberal and mechanical arts, and the first to elucidate astronomy. He\r\nwrote _The Golden Bough_, _Book of Longitude and Latitude_, _Book of\r\nElection_, _Canons on the Planets_, and a treatise on the astrolabe.\r\nAmong his pastimes he brought to light alchemy which the philosopher\r\nMorienus developed in his writings. _The Six Principles of Things_ is\r\na treatise part astronomical and part astrological, considering the\r\nnatures of the signs and the powers of the planets in their houses.\r\nCitations of such authors as Zahel and Dorotheus show that the work is\r\nmuch later than Hermes. It is followed by four other brief treatises,\r\nof which the first discusses time, the winds, pestilences, divination\r\nfrom thunder, and eclipses of the sun and the moon; the second and the\r\nthird deal with the astrological topics, _Of the triple power of the\r\ncelestial bodies_, and _Of the efficacy of medicines according to the\r\npower of the planets and the effect of the signs_. The fourth treatise\r\ntells how to use the astrolabe.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Liber lune._]\r\n\r\nOf the books of bad necromantic images for each of the seven planets\r\nby Hermes, which the _Speculum astronomiae_ censured, at least one\r\nseems to have been preserved for our inspection in the manuscripts,\r\nsince it has the same _Incipit_ as that cited by Albert, “_Probavi\r\nomnes libros_ ...,” and the same title, _Liber lune_,[686] or _Book\r\nof the Moon_, or, as it is more fully described, of the twenty-eight\r\nmansions and twenty-eight images of the moon and the fifty-four angels\r\nwho serve the images. And as Albert spoke of a treatise of magic\r\nillusions which accompanied the seven books of necromantic images for\r\nthe planets, so this _Liber lune_ is itself also called _Mercury’s\r\nmagic illusion_.[687] It probably is the same _Book of Images of\r\nthe Moon_ which William of Auvergne described as attempting to work\r\nmagic by the names of God. The treatise opens in the usual style of\r\napocryphal literature by narrating how this marvelous volume came to\r\nbe discovered. After some “investigator of wisdom and truth and friend\r\nof nature had read the volumes of many wise men,” he found this one\r\nin a golden ark within a silver chest which was in turn placed in a\r\ncasket of lead,--a variant on Portia’s method. He then translated it\r\ninto Arabic for the benefit of the many. Nevertheless we have the usual\r\ncaution to fear God and not show the book to anyone nor allow any\r\npolluted man to touch it, since with it all evils as well as all goods\r\nmay be accomplished. It tells how to engrave images as the moon passes\r\nthrough each of its twenty-eight houses. The names of angels have to be\r\nrepeated seven times and suffumigations performed seven times in the\r\nname of God the merciful and pious. Just as the moon is nearer to us\r\nthan other planets and more efficacious, so this book, if we understand\r\nit aright, is more precious than any other. Hermes declares that he\r\nhas proved all the books of the seven planets and not found one truer\r\nor more perfect than this most precious portion. Balenuch, however,\r\na superior and most skilful philosopher, does much of the talking\r\nfor his master Hermes. The Latin text retains the Arabic names for\r\nthe mansions of the moon, the fifty-four angels also have outlandish\r\nnames, and a wood that grows in an island in India is required in the\r\nsuffumigations. Instructions are given for engraving images which\r\nwill destroy villa, region, or town; make men dumb; restrain sexual\r\nintercourse within a given area; heat baths at night; congregate ten\r\nthousand birds and bees; or twist a man’s limbs. Four special recipes\r\nare given to injure an enemy or cause him to sicken.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Hermes on images of the seven planets.]\r\n\r\nWe shall leave until our chapter on the Pseudo-Aristotle “The book of\r\nthe spiritual works of Aristotle, or the book _Antimaquis_, which is\r\nthe book of the secrets of Hermes ... the ancient book of the seven\r\nplanets.” But in at least one manuscript the work of Hermes on the\r\nimages of the moon is accompanied by another briefer treatise ascribed\r\nto him on the images of the seven planets, one for each day of the\r\nweek, to be made in the first hour of that day which is ruled by the\r\nplanet after which the day is named. This little treatise begins with\r\nthe words, “Said Hermes, editor of this book, I have examined many\r\nsciences of images.”[688] Altogether I have noted traces of it in four\r\nmanuscripts.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Book of Venus_ of Toz.]\r\n\r\nIn two of these manuscripts the work of Hermes on images of the seven\r\nplanets is immediately followed by a work of Toc or Toz Graecus on the\r\noccult virtues of stones called the Book of Venus or of the twelve\r\nstones of Venus.[689] The first part of the treatise, however, consists\r\nof instructions, largely astrological in character but also including\r\nuse of names of spirits and suffumigations, for casting a metal image\r\nin the name of Venus. Astrological symbols are to be placed on the\r\nbreast, right palm, and foot of the image.\r\n\r\nIn the discussion of stones each paragraph opens with the words,\r\n“Said Toz.” The use of these stones is mainly medicinal, however, and\r\nconsists usually in taking a certain weight of the stone in question.\r\nOf astrology, spirits, and power of words there is little more said.\r\nSome marvelous virtues are attributed to stones nevertheless. With one,\r\nif you secretly touch two persons who have hitherto been firm friends,\r\nyou will make them enemies “even to the end of the world. And if\r\nanyone grates from it the weight of one _argenteus_ and mixes it with\r\nserpent’s blood (possibly the herb of that name) and gives it to anyone\r\nto drink, he will flee from place to place.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Further mentions of Toz Graecus.]\r\n\r\nToz Graecus was cited by more than one medieval writer and the work\r\nwhich we have just been describing was not the only one that then\r\ncirculated under his name, although it seems to be cited by Daniel\r\nMorley in the twelfth century.[690] Albertus Magnus in his list of\r\nevil books on images in the _Speculum astronomiae_ included a work on\r\nthe images of Venus,[691] another on the four mirrors of Venus, and\r\na third on stations for the cult of Venus. This last is also alluded\r\nto by William of Auvergne, bishop of Paris, in his _De universo_, and\r\nascribed by him to “Thot grecus.”[692] There also was once among the\r\nmanuscripts of Amplonius at Erfurt a “book of Toz Grecus containing\r\nfifty chapters on the stations of the planets.”[693] Cecco d’Ascoli,\r\nthe early fourteenth century astrologer, mentions together “Evax king\r\nof the Arabs and Zot grecus and Germa of Babylon.” Which reminds one\r\nof Albert’s allusion in his theological _Summa_[694] to “the teachings\r\nof that branch of necromancy” which treats of “images and rings and\r\nmirrors of Venus and seals of demons,” and is expounded in the works\r\nof Achot of Greece--who is probably our Toz Graecus, Grema of Babylon,\r\nand Hermes the Egyptian. And again in his work on minerals[695] Albert\r\nlists together as authorities on the engraving of gems with images the\r\nnames of Magor Graecus, Germa of Babylon, and Hermes the Egyptian.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Toz the same as Thoth or Hermes Trismegistus.]\r\n\r\nMoreover, not only is the work of Toz closely associated both in the\r\nextant manuscripts and by Albertus Magnus with that of Hermes, but\r\nWilliam of Auvergne’s spelling “Thot” shows what has perhaps already\r\noccurred to the reader, that this Toc or Toz Graecus is no other than\r\nthe Greek equivalent of the Egyptian god Thoth; in other words, Hermes\r\nTrismegistus himself. I have not yet mentioned one other treatise found\r\nin a seventeenth century manuscript, and which, while very likely a\r\nlater invention, shows at least that Toz remained a name to conjure\r\nwith down into modern times.[696] The work is called _A commentary\r\nby Toz Graecus, philosopher of great name, upon the books of Solomon\r\nto Rehoboam concerning secrets of secrets_. A long preface tells how\r\nSolomon summed up all his vast knowledge in this book for the benefit\r\nof his son Rehoboam, and Rehoboam buried it in his tomb in an ivory\r\ncasket, and Toz after its discovery wept at his inability to comprehend\r\nit, until it was revealed to him through an angel of God on condition\r\nthat he explain it only to the worthy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Magic experiments.]\r\n\r\nThe text is full of magic experiments: experiments of theft;\r\nexperiments in invisibility; love experiments; experiments in\r\ngaining favor; experiments in hate and destruction; “extraordinary\r\nexperiments”; “playful experiments”; and so on. These with\r\nconjurations, characters, and suffumigations make up the bulk of the\r\nfirst book. The second book deals chiefly with “how exorcists and their\r\nallies and disciples should conduct themselves,” and with the varied\r\nparaphernalia required by magicians: fasts, baths, vestments, the knife\r\nor sword, the magic circle, fumigations, water and hyssop; light and\r\nfire, pen and ink, blood, parchment, stylus, wax, needle, membrane,\r\ncharacters, sacrifices, and astrological images. Two of its twenty-two\r\nchapters deal with “the places where by rights experiments should be\r\nperformed” and with “all the precepts of the arts or experiments.” In\r\nanother seventeenth century manuscript are _Seven Books of Magical\r\nExperiments of Hermes Trismegistus_. “And they are magic secrets of the\r\nkings of Egypt,” drawn, we are told, from the treasury of Rudolph II,\r\nHoly Roman emperor from 1576 to 1612.[697] Another manuscript at Vienna\r\ncontains a German translation of the same work.[698]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[653] For detailed references for this and the preceding statements see\r\nLippmann (1919), pp. 357-9.\r\n\r\n[654] I have used the edition of Paris, 1564, _Liber de compositione\r\nalchemiae quem edidit Morienus Romanus Calid Regi Aegyptiorum Quem\r\nRobertus Castrensis de Arabico in Latinum transtulit_. A number of MSS\r\nof the work will be found listed in the index of Black’s Catalogue of\r\nthe Ashmolean MSS, and elsewhere, as in Sloane 3697 and Digby 162, 13th\r\ncentury, fols. 21v and 23r. Other editions are Basel, 1559; Basel,\r\n1593, in _Artis Auriferae quam Chemiam vocant_, II, 1-54; and Geneva,\r\n1702, in J. J. Manget, _Bibliotheca Chemica Curiosa_, I, 509-19.\r\n\r\n[655] See above, chapter 38, p. 83.\r\n\r\n[656] Berthelot (1893) I, 234, took the date to be 1182 A. D. and\r\nso, on the basis of this remark, placed the introduction of Arabic\r\nalchemy into Latin learning 38 years too late. It is rather amusing\r\nthat Lippmann, who elsewhere avails himself of petty pretexts to\r\nbelittle the work of Berthelot, should have overlooked this error.\r\nHe still (1919), pp. 358 and 482, states the date as 1182 A. D.,\r\nalthough he is puzzled how to reconcile it with that of 1143 A. D. for\r\nRobertus Castrensis or Robert de Retines. He also is at a loss as to\r\nthe identity of this Robert or the meaning of “Castrensis,” and has\r\nno knowledge of the publications of Karpinski (1915) and Haskins, EHR\r\n(1915).\r\n\r\n[657] Lippmann (1919), p. 358.\r\n\r\n[658] Berthelot is a poor guide in any such matter since his\r\npretentious volumes on medieval alchemy are based on the study of a\r\ncomparatively small number of MSS at Paris. He made little or no use\r\nof the Sloane collection in the British Museum which is very rich in\r\nalchemical MSS, a subject in which Sir Hans Sloane was apparently much\r\ninterested, or of the Ashmolean collection at Oxford, although Elias\r\nAshmole edited the _Theatrum Chemicum Britannicum_, 1652, “containing\r\nseveral poetical pieces of our famous English philosophers who have\r\nwritten the hermetic mysteries in their own ancient language,”--a work\r\nin which Ashmole himself is called _Mercuriophilus Anglicus_.\r\n\r\n[659] The two earliest MSS used by Berthelot for medieval Latin alchemy\r\nwere BN 6514 and 7156 of the late 13th or early 14th century. In an\r\nearlier chapter we have mentioned Berlin 956 of the 12th century, fol.\r\n21, “Hic incipit alchamia,” and probably a fairly long list could be\r\nmade of alchemical MSS of the 13th century, like Digby 162 mentioned\r\nin a previous note to this chapter. However, as a rule the numerous\r\nalchemical collections in the Sloane MSS--a majority of the MSS\r\nnumbered from about 3600 to about 3900 are in whole or part concerned\r\nwith alchemy, as well as a number of earlier numbers--are not earlier\r\nthan the 14th and 15th centuries, and many are subsequent to the\r\ninvention of printing.\r\n\r\n[660] Riccard. 119.\r\n\r\n[661] Sloane 1698, 14th century, fol. 53-, “Hic incipiunt secreta\r\nHermetis inventoris metallorum secundum transmutationis naturam ... /\r\n...

There are several Greek versions of it, all\r\nprofessedly translations from some oriental original, but the volume\r\nwhich his patron gave him to translate into Latin is that translated\r\ninto Greek at Constantinople in 1168[705] or 1169[706] by order of the\r\nByzantine emperor, Manuel Comnenus, whom we shall also find associated\r\nwith the _Letter of Prester John_ of which we shall treat in the next\r\nchapter. The translator speaks of the work as _The Book of Natural\r\nVirtues, Complaints, and Cures_, but adds that it is a compilation from\r\ntwo other books, namely, _The Experience of the Kiranides of Kiranus,\r\nKing of Persia_, and _The Book of Harpocration[707] of Alexandria to\r\nhis Daughter_. There then follows the preface of Harpocration to his\r\ndaughter, which tells of a certain city and of encountering an aged\r\nsage there, of great towers and of precious writing on a column which\r\nHarpocration proceeds to transcribe. We are given to understand that\r\nthe original was written in “antique archaic Syriac” and was as old as\r\nthe Euphrates.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Arrangement of the text.]\r\n\r\nThe text is divided into four books, each arranged alphabetically.\r\nThe first book subdivides into “Elements.” For example, _Elementum\r\nXII_ is devoted to a tree, a bird, a stone, and a fish, each of which\r\nbegins with the letter M. Most, however, of the virtues and medicinal\r\nprescriptions which follow have to do with the tree or herb only. The\r\nsecond book treats of beasts or quadrupeds, the third of birds, and the\r\nfourth of fish.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Virtues of a tree.]\r\n\r\nMuch superstition and magical procedure is found scattered through,\r\nor better, crowded into, the book. For instance, in a medicinal\r\napplication of the cyme of the tree Μορέα, one is to face the southwest\r\nwind, use two fingers of the left hand to remove the cyme, then look\r\nbehind one toward the east, wrap the cyme in purple or red silk\r\n(_vera?_), and touch the patient with it or bind it about her. In\r\nanother recipe the fruit of this tree is to be compounded in varying\r\nproportions with such substances as an Indian stone and the tips of\r\nthe wings of crows and is then to be stirred with a crow’s feather\r\nuntil the mixture is “soft and sticky.” In a third prescription a\r\nstone engraved with an image of the fish mentioned under the letter\r\nM--μόρμυρος, and enclosed in an iron box, is to be combined with the\r\n“eyes” (buds?) of the tree _Morea_ as an amulet against certain ills.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Feats of magic.]\r\n\r\nIn some cases the end sought as well as the procedure employed is\r\nmagical rather than medicinal. In another chapter of the first book,\r\nfor example, the reader is instructed how to make a _licinium_ or\r\ncombustible compound in whose light those present will appear to one\r\nanother like flaming demons. Or in book two the reader is told that\r\nwearing the dried tongue of a weasel inside his socks will close the\r\nmouths of his enemies. The weasel’s testicles, right and left, are used\r\nas charms to stimulate and prevent conception respectively.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: An incantation to an eagle.]\r\n\r\nIncantations are employed in connection with the eagle, the first of\r\nforty-four birds taken up in the third book. Catch one, collect the\r\ndung it makes during the first day and night of its captivity, then\r\nbind its feet and beak and whisper in its ear, “Oh, eagle, friend of\r\nman, I am about to slay you for the cure of every infirmity. I conjure\r\nyou by the God of earth and sky and by the four elements that you\r\nefficaciously work each and every cure for which you are oblated.”\r\nThe eagle is then decapitated with a sword composed entirely of iron,\r\nall its blood is carefully caught in a bowl, its heart and entrails\r\nare removed and placed in wine, and other directions observed. The\r\ndiscussion of the virtues of fish in the fourth and last book is\r\nessentially identical in character with the examples already given for\r\nplants, birds, and beasts.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Alchiranus.]\r\n\r\nIn a sixteenth century manuscript at Venice[708] is a Latin version\r\nwhich would seem to be translated from the Arabic since it gives the\r\nauthor’s name as Alchiranus, although some scholiast has interpolated\r\nand added to the words of this author and of Harpocration. As described\r\nby Valentinelli the arrangement into books is the same as that which we\r\nhave noted. Valentinelli also was impressed by the fact that “medical\r\nsubstances are used to produce not merely physical but moral effects,\r\nsuch as prescience of the future, dispelling demons and evil phantoms,\r\navoiding shipwreck by binding the heart of a _foca_ to the mast of\r\nthe vessel; discovering what sort of life a woman has led, becoming\r\ninvisible, averting storms, perils, wild beasts, robbers.” And further\r\nthat “the efficacy of the medicaments is dependent upon their mode of\r\npreparation or application, at the rising or setting of the sun, at the\r\nwaning or waxing of the moon, by uttering certain words or engraving\r\nstones.”[709]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Treatises on seven, twelve, and nineteen herbs.]\r\n\r\nThe Latin translator of the Kiranides says that it should be preceded\r\nby the book of Alexander the Great concerning seven herbs and the\r\nseven planets, and by the Mystery of Thessalus to Hermes about twelve\r\nherbs for the twelve signs of the zodiac and seven herbs for the seven\r\nstars. And in what is left of the preface to the latter treatise in\r\nan Erfurt manuscript we are told that after discovering the volumes\r\nof the Kyranides the writer found also in the city of Troy the\r\npresent treatise enclosed in a monument along with the bones of the\r\nfirst king named Kyrannis.[710] The first treatise on seven herbs,\r\nhowever, seems to be more often ascribed in the manuscripts to an\r\nAlexius Affricus[711] or Flaccus Africanus[712] than to Alexander the\r\nGreat.[713] Alexius or Flaccus seems to address his work to a Claudius\r\nor Glandiger of Athens. The work of Thessalus, whose name is sometimes\r\ncorrupted to Tesalus or Texilus, and whose work is variously styled of\r\ntwelve or of nineteen herbs, usually is found with the other treatise\r\nin the manuscripts.[714] It was one of the authorities acknowledged\r\nby Jacobus de Dondis in his _Aggregatio Medicamentorum_, written\r\nin 1355.[715] The treatise on seven herbs of Alexander or Flaccus\r\nAfricanus closes with the direction that the herbs should be gathered\r\nfrom the twenty-first to twenty-seventh day of the moon, with Mercury\r\nrising during the entire first hour of the day. As they are plucked,\r\nthe passion of our Lord should be mentioned, and they should be\r\npreserved in barley or wheat. But one manuscript adds, “But do not put\r\ncredulity in them beyond due measure.”[716] We have, of course, already\r\nmet with similar treatises ascribed to Enoch and Hermes.[717]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Belenus.]\r\n\r\nThe Belenus, as whose disciple Flaccus Africanus is represented, is\r\nalso the reputed author of a work on astrological images found in\r\nseveral manuscripts of the British Museum.[718] Albertus Magnus in the\r\n_Speculum astronomiae_ attributed to Belenus two reprehensible books\r\nof necromantic images.[719] The _Turba philosophorum_, a medieval\r\nwork of alchemy consisting in large measure of Latin re-translation\r\nof Arabic versions from Greek alchemists, also cites a Belus or\r\nBelinus. The name is believed to be a corruption from Apollonius of\r\nTyana, with whom Apollonius of Perga, the mathematician, is perhaps\r\nalso confused.[720] One of the _Incipits_ of the tracts listed in the\r\n_Speculum astronomiae_ is, “Said Belenus who is also called Apollo.”\r\nHowever, many medieval Latin manuscripts attribute works to Apollonius\r\nunder that name, as in the case of a work on the Notory Art which we\r\nshall mention in another chapter.[721]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[699] I know of no very early printed editions, but have consulted a\r\ncopy published at Leipzig in 1638, and two MSS, Ashmole 1471, late 14th\r\ncentury, fols. 143v-167r, and Arundel 342, 14th century, in an Italian\r\nhand. The work is also contained either _in toto_ or brief excerpt in\r\nseveral Sloane MSS, and was printed in English in 1685 as _The Magick\r\nof Kiranus_.

Possibly the translator may be Philip, the cleric of Tripoli,\r\nwho speaks of himself in a similarly humble style, and of whom we shall\r\nspeak in the next two chapters.\r\n\r\n[705] According to the printed text of 1638.\r\n\r\n[706] Ashmole 1471, “_anno Christi_ 1280 _aliter_ 1169.”\r\n\r\n[707] Harpocration is cited by Galen: see Kühn XII, 629, “ad aures\r\npurulentas Harpocration.”\r\n\r\n[708] S.

So William of Auvergne,\r\nbishop of Paris, writing in the first half of the thirteenth century,\r\nstates that feats of magic are very seldom wrought in the Europe of\r\nhis time. For one thing, as Origen and other early church fathers had\r\nalready explained, the demons since the coming of Christ to earth\r\nhad largely ceased their magical activities in Christian lands. But\r\nanother reason was that the materials for working natural magic, the\r\ngems and herbs and animals with marvelous virtues, were seldom found\r\nin European lands. In India and other countries adjacent to it,\r\non the contrary, such materials were abundant. Hence natural magic\r\nstill flourished there and it was a land of many experimenters and of\r\nskilful marvel-workers.[723] Similarly Albertus Magnus, discussing the\r\nmarvelous powers of astrological images, states that the best gems upon\r\nwhich to engrave them are those from India.[724] Costa ben Luca says in\r\nhis work on physical ligatures that doctors in India are firm believers\r\nin the efficacy of incantations and adjurations; and about 1295 Peter\r\nof Abano speaks in his _Phisionomia_ of the wise men of India as\r\nprolix on astrological themes. Medieval geomancies, too, often claim a\r\nconnection with India.[725]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: India’s real contribution to knowledge.]\r\n\r\nIt should also be kept in mind, however, that medieval men believed\r\nthat they derived from India learning which seems to us even to-day as\r\nsound and useful as it did to them then; for example, the Hindu-Arabic\r\nnumerals.[726] Leonardo of Pisa, the great arithmetician of the early\r\nthirteenth century, tells us in the preface to his _Liber Abaci_[727]\r\nhow, summoned as a boy to join his father who was a customs official\r\nat a trading station in Algeria, he was introduced to the art of\r\nreckoning “by a marvelous method through the nine figures of the\r\nIndians.” Thus we see that India’s marvels were not always false.\r\nLater he traveled in Egypt, Syria, Greece, Sicily, and Provence and\r\nstudied their various methods of reckoning, but vastly preferred the\r\nIndian method to all others, returned to a more intensive study of it,\r\nand developed it further by additions from Euclid and contributions\r\nof his own. Not always, it is true, were medieval mathematicians as\r\nfavorable to Indian methods as this. Jordanus Nemorarius in one passage\r\ncharacterizes an Indian theorem as “nothing but mere credulity without\r\ndemonstration.”[728] But to return to the natural marvels of India.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The legend of Prester John.]\r\n\r\nIn the extraordinary accounts of Prester John,[729] which are first\r\nmet in the twelfth century and were added to with succeeding centuries\r\nand which had great currency from the start, as the number of extant\r\nmanuscripts shows, the natural marvels of India vie in impressiveness\r\nand wonderment with the power of Prester John himself and with the\r\nmiracles of the Apostle Thomas.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Miracles of the Apostle Thomas.]\r\n\r\nOdo, Abbot of St. Rémy from 1118 to 1151, states in a letter in\r\nresponse to the inquiry of a Count Thomas what had happened when\r\nhe was recently in Rome. Byzantine ambassadors introduced to the\r\npope an archbishop of India who had already had the extraordinary\r\nand disconcerting experience of having to return a third time to\r\nConstantinople for a new prince for his country, each previous\r\nByzantine nominee having died on his hands. This archbishop said that\r\nthe body of the Apostle Thomas was preserved in his country in a church\r\nrich in treasure and ornaments and surrounded by a river fordable only\r\nat the time of the saint’s festival. On that solemn occasion the\r\nApostle’s body was shown to believers and the Apostle would raise his\r\narm and open his hand to receive their gifts, but close it and refuse\r\nto receive any gift offered by a heretic. When this tale reached the\r\npope’s ears he forbade the archbishop to disseminate such falsehoods\r\nfurther under pain of anathema, but the archbishop finally convinced\r\nthe pope by taking an oath on the holy gospels.\r\n\r\nAnother longer and anonymous account has come down from manuscripts\r\ngoing back to the twelfth century of the visit of a Patriarch John of\r\nIndia to Rome under Pope Calixtus II (1119-1124). It is this account\r\nwhich is often joined in the manuscripts and early printed editions\r\nwith the _Letter of Prester John_ of which we shall presently speak.\r\nIn this account the Patriarch John told “of memorable matters of his\r\nIndian region that were unknown to the Romans,” such as of the gold and\r\ngems in the river Physon which flows from Paradise, “but especially\r\nof the miracles of the most holy Apostle Thomas.” Without going into\r\nfurther details, such as that of the miraculous balsam lamp, which\r\ndiffer a good deal from Odo’s account, it may be noted that in this\r\naccount the Apostle’s hand ministers the Eucharist to believers and\r\nrefuses it to infidels and sinners.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Otto of Freising on Prester John, the descendant of the\r\nMagi.]\r\n\r\nWe have progressed from an archbishop of India to a Patriarch John; we\r\nnow come to Prester John the monarch. The historian, Otto of Freising,\r\nlearned in 1145 from a Syrian bishop at Rome of a great victory\r\nrecently gained over the Moslems by “a certain John who lived beyond\r\nPersia and Armenia in the extreme East, a king and priest, since he was\r\na Christian by race but a Nestorian ... Prester John, for so they are\r\nwont to call him.” He was of the ancient progeny of the Magi mentioned\r\nin the Gospel, ruled the same races as they, and enjoyed such glory and\r\nabundance that he was said to use only an emerald scepter. After his\r\nvictory he would have come to the aid of the crusaders at Jerusalem,\r\nbut could not cross the Tigris, although he marched north along its\r\neastern bank and waited for some years in the hope that it would freeze\r\nover.[730]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Prester John’s letter to the Emperor Manuel.]\r\n\r\nThis Prester John was to be heard from again, however, for in the same\r\ncentury there appeared a letter purporting to have been written by\r\nhim to the Byzantine Emperor, Manuel (1143-1180).[731] It is in this\r\nletter that the natural and artificial marvels of India and adjacent\r\nterritories--Prester John’s dominion reaches from farther India to the\r\nBabylonian desert--are especially recorded. This letter even in its\r\nearliest and briefest form seems without doubt a western forgery and\r\nbears the marks of its Latin origin,[732] since despite the use of a\r\nfew Greek ecclesiastical and official terms[733] and the attempt to\r\nrehearse unheard-of wonders, the writer indulges in a sneer at Greek\r\nadoration of the emperor[734] and is unable to conceive of Prester\r\nJohn except as a feudal overlord[735] with the usual kings, dukes and\r\ncounts, archbishops, bishops and abbots under him. The letter then\r\nis of value chiefly as showing us what ideas prevailed concerning\r\nIndia and the orient in the Latin world of the twelfth and succeeding\r\ncenturies, for the letter received many additions and variations, was\r\ntranslated into the vernacular languages, and appeared in print before\r\n1500.[736] In the following account of its contents, however, I shall\r\ntry to describe the letter as it existed in the twelfth century, after\r\nwhich I shall mention what seem to be interpolations of the thirteenth\r\nor later centuries.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Marvels recounted by Prester John.]\r\n\r\nBut while different copies of the work vary, all have the same general\r\ncharacter. Prester John tells what a mighty and Christian potentate he\r\nis and describes his marvelous palaces and contrivances or the natural\r\nmarvels, strange beasts and serpents, monstrous races of men, potent\r\nherbs, stones, and fountains, to be found in the lands owning his sway.\r\nIn one province is the herb _assidios_ which enables its bearer to rout\r\nan impure spirit and force him to disclose his name and whence he\r\ncomes. “Wherefore impure spirits in that land dare not take possession\r\nof anyone.”[737] A fountain flows from Mount Olympus not three days’\r\njourney from Paradise whence Adam was expelled. Three draughts from it\r\ntaken fasting insure one henceforth from all infirmity, and however\r\nlong one may live, one will seem henceforth but thirty years of\r\nage.[738] Then there are some little stones which eagles often bring\r\nto Prester John’s territories and which worn on the finger preserve or\r\nrestore the sight, or if consecrated with a lawful incantation, make\r\none invisible and dispel envy and hatred and promote concord.[739]\r\nAfter a description of a sea of sand in which there are various kinds\r\nof edible fish and a river of stones, Prester John soon mentions the\r\nworms which in his language are called salamanders, who cannot live\r\nexcept in fire, and from whose skins he has robes made which can be\r\ncleansed only by fire.[740] After some boasting concerning the absence\r\nof poverty, crime, and falsehood in his country and about the pomp and\r\nwealth with which he goes forth to war, Prester John then comes to the\r\ndescription of his palace, which is similar to that which the Apostle\r\nThomas built for Gundaphorus, King of India. Its gates of sardonyx\r\nmixed with _cornu cerastis_ (horn of the horned serpents) prevent the\r\nsecret introduction of poison; a couch of sapphire keeps John chaste;\r\nthe square before the palace where judicial duels are held is paved\r\nwith onyx “in order that the courage of the fighters may be increased\r\nby the virtue of the stone.”[741] Near this square is a magic mirror\r\nwhich reveals all plots in the provinces subject to Prester John or\r\nin adjacent lands.[742] In some manuscripts of the twelfth century is\r\na description of another palace which before Prester John’s birth his\r\nfather was instructed in a dream to build for his son. One feature\r\nof it is that no matter how hungry one may be on entering it, he\r\nalways comes out feeling as full as if he had partaken of a sumptuous\r\nbanquet.[743]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Additional marvels in later versions.]\r\n\r\nTo such marvels in the early versions of the _Letter of Prester\r\nJohn_ were added others in the course of the thirteenth century\r\nand later middle ages:--the huge man-eating ants who mined gold by\r\nnight;[744] the land where men lived on manna, a substance which we\r\nshall find somewhat similarly mentioned by Michael Scot and Thomas of\r\nCantimpré;[745] the tale, which we shall also hear from Roger Bacon,\r\nof men who tame flying dragons by their incantations and magic, saddle\r\nand bridle them, and ride them through the air;[746] the five marvelous\r\nstones that froze or heated or reduced to an even state of temperature\r\nor made light or dark everything within a radius of five miles; the\r\nsecond five stones, of which two were unconsecrated and turned water to\r\nmilk or wine, while three were consecrated and would respectively cause\r\nfish to congregate, wild beasts to follow one, and, sprinkled with hot\r\nlion’s blood, produce a conflagration which could only be quenched by\r\nsprinkling the stone with hot dragon’s blood;[747] the marvelous mill\r\noperated by the occult virtue of the stone adamant;[748] the wonderful\r\ntree on which the wonderful healing apple grew;[749] the marvelous\r\nchapel of glass, always just big enough for as many persons as entered\r\nit;[750] and the stone and the fountain that served as fireless\r\nheaters.[751] In another case a marvel is wrought by stone and fountain\r\ncombined. Two old men guard a large stone and admit to its hollow only\r\nChristians or those who desire to become Christians. If this profession\r\nof faith is genuine, the water in the hollow which is usually only four\r\nfingers deep thrice rises above the head of the person admitted, who\r\nthereupon emerges recovered from all sickness.[752]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The letter of Pope Alexander III.]\r\n\r\nHow real Prester John was to the men of the twelfth century may be\r\nseen from the fact that Pope Alexander III on September 27, 1177,\r\naddressed from the Rialto in Venice a letter to him or to some actual\r\neastern potentate whom he had confused with him.[753] The Pope does not\r\nexpressly mention Prester John’s letter to Manuel but says that he has\r\nheard of him from many persons and common report, and more especially\r\nfrom “Master Philip, our friend and physician,” who had talked “with\r\ngreat and honourable men of your kingdom,” by whom he had been informed\r\nof their ruler’s desire for a church and altar at Jerusalem. It is this\r\nPhilip whom the Pope now sends with his letter to Prester John and to\r\ninstruct him in the doctrine of the Roman church. But it is a long and\r\nlaborious journey involving many hardships and vicissitudes and the\r\ntraversing of many countries with barbarous and unknown languages.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Philip, the papal physician.]\r\n\r\nWhether Philip ever succeeded in delivering the letter is not known and\r\nhe has himself been regarded as a mysterious personage of whom nothing\r\nfurther was known.[754] I would suggest, however, that, as he seems to\r\nhave been conversant with Syria and the Holy Land, he may have been\r\nthe Philip of whose translation of the _Secret of Secrets_ of the\r\nPseudo-Aristotle we shall treat in the next chapter, a work which he\r\nfound in Antioch and dedicated to the bishop of Tripoli. Or, if we do\r\nnot meet this particular Philip again, we shall find in close relations\r\nwith other popes other physicians whose names are prominent in the\r\nnatural and occult science of the age.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[722] Berlin 956, 12th century, fols. 24-25.\r\n\r\n[723] _Gulielmi Alverni ...

Kgl. Sächs. Gesells. d. Wiss._ VII (1879),\r\n627-1030; VIII (1883) 1-186.\r\n\r\n[730] In Yule (1903) I, 231-7, Cordier discusses whether this monarch\r\nwas Gurkhan of Kara Khitai (as urged by d’Avezac and Oppert) who “in\r\n1141 came to the aid of the King of Khwarizmi against Sanjar, the\r\nSeljukian sovereign of Persia, ... and defeated that prince with great\r\nslaughter,” or whether he was “John Orbelian ... for years the pride of\r\nGeorgia and the hammer of the Turks” (as urged by Professor Bruun of\r\nOdessa).\r\n\r\n[731] For its text, with interpolations distinguished from the\r\noriginal text, see Zarncke (1879) 909-924. Some of the passages which\r\nZarncke regards as interpolations are, however, already found in\r\n12th century MSS. On the other hand, his text does not include all\r\nthe interpolations and variations to be found even in the MSS which\r\nhe describes. For instance, in BN 6244A, fol. 130r, just before the\r\ndescription of the herb _assidios_, occurs a passage which may be\r\ntranslated as follows: “You should know also that in our country we do\r\nnot need doctors, for we have precious stones, herbs, fountains, and\r\ntrees of so great virtue that they prevail against every infirmity and\r\nagainst poisons and wounds. And we have books which instruct us and\r\ndistinguish between the potencies and virtues of the herbs.” In this MS\r\nPrester John is also more voluble on the theme of his devotion to the\r\nChristian faith than appears in Zarncke’s text, and (fols. 127v-128r)\r\nrepeats the story of the administration of the Eucharist by the hand\r\nof the body of the Apostle Thomas. Zarncke lists about one hundred MSS\r\nof the letter but fails to use or mention any of those in the Bodleian\r\nLibrary where, for instance, Digby 158, fols. 2r-5v, is of the twelfth\r\ncentury. Another twelfth century MS not in his list is Paris Arsenal\r\n379A, fol. 34. Zarncke also does not list the MSS of the letter at\r\nMadrid and Wolfenbüttel.\r\n\r\n[732] In many MSS. nothing is said of its being a translation or when\r\nor by whom it was translated; others state that it was translated into\r\nGreek and Latin, or, in at least one case, from Arabic into Latin.\r\nOnly from the thirteenth century on, I think, is Christian, Archbishop\r\nof Mainz, sometimes said to have translated it from Greek into Latin.\r\nOften it is simply stated that Manuel transmitted the letter to the\r\nEmperor Frederick, to whom also it is sometimes represented as sent\r\ndirect by Prester John. Sometimes it is to the Pope to whom the letter\r\ncomes from Manuel or Prester John.\r\n\r\nThe statement that Manuel transmitted the letter to the Emperor\r\nFrederick makes one wonder whether Anselm, Bishop of Havelberg\r\nand later of Ravenna, can have had anything to do with it. He was\r\nsent by Frederick on an embassy to Manuel in 1153, which seems to\r\nidentify him with the author of a “_Liber de diversitate nature\r\net persone proprietatumque personalium non tam Latinorum quam ex\r\nGrecorum auctoritatibus extractus_”--CUL 1824 (Qi. vi. 27), beautiful\r\n13th century hand, fols. 129-76,--who states in his preface that he\r\ncollected his Greek authorities in Constantinople where he was sent by\r\nFrederick on an embassy to Manuel, and on his return to Germany showed\r\nthem to “_Petro venerabili Tusculano episcopo_.”\r\n\r\n[733] Such as Apocrisarius and Archimandrite, a word however not\r\nentirely unknown in the west; see Ducange.\r\n\r\n[734] “Cum enim hominem nos esse cognoscamus, te Graeculi tui Deum\r\nesse existimant, cum te mortalem et humanae corruptioni subiacere\r\ncognoscamus,” Zarncke (1879) 910.\r\n\r\n[735] For instance, the writer twice alludes to the square before\r\nPrester John’s palace where he watches the combatants in judicial duels\r\nor wager of battle, Zarncke (1879) 918, 919.\r\n\r\n[736] I have seen a copy in the British Museum (IA.8685), _De\r\nMirabilibus Indiae_, where the account given Calixtus II of miracles of\r\nthe Apostle Thomas is run together with the letter of Prester John.\r\n\r\n[737] Zarncke, 912; Digby 158, fol. 2v; BN 2342, fol. 191v; BN 3359,\r\nfol. 144v.\r\n\r\n[738] Zarncke, 912-913; MSS as before. This fountain of youth was\r\nlittle improved upon by another inserted later (Zarncke, 920-21; BN\r\n3359, fol. 146v; not in the other two MSS), which one had to taste\r\nthrice daily on a fasting stomach for three years, three months,\r\nthree weeks, three days, and three hours, in order to live and remain\r\nyouthful for three hundred years, three months, three weeks, three\r\ndays, and three hours.\r\n\r\n[739] Zarncke, 913; Digby 158, fol. 3r, etc.\r\n\r\n[740] Zarncke, 915; Digby 158, fol. 3v; BN 2342, fol. 192r; BN 3359,\r\nfol. 145r. It will be recalled that Charlemagne is said to have had\r\nsuch a garment. Pliny discussed both salamanders and asbestos but did\r\nnot connect the two. Marco Polo, however, says (I 42, Yule (1903)\r\nI, 212-3), “The real truth is that the salamander is no beast, as\r\nthey allege in our part of the world, but is a substance found in\r\nthe earth.... Everybody must be aware that it can be no animal’s\r\nnature to live in fire, seeing that every animal is composed of all\r\nfour elements.” Polo confirms, however, the report of robes made of\r\nincombustible mineral fibre and cleansed by fire.\r\n\r\n[741] Zarncke, 918; Digby 158, fol. 4r; BN 2342, fol. 192r; BN 3359,\r\nfol. 145v.\r\n\r\n[742] Zarncke, 919-20; Digby 158, fols. 4v-5r; BN 2342, fol. 192v; BN\r\n3359, fol. 146r.\r\n\r\n[743] Zarncke, 920-22; Digby 158 fol. 5v; BN 2342, fol. 192v; BN 3359,\r\nfol. 146r-v.\r\n\r\n[744] Zarncke, 911.\r\n\r\n[745] _Ibid._, 913.

We also saw that by about 800 A. D. at least a\r\nseparate Letter of Alexander to Aristotle on the Marvels of India was\r\ncurrent in the Latin west, and in the present chapter it is especially\r\nto the Pseudo-Aristotle and his connection with Alexander and India,\r\nrather than to the Pseudo-Callisthenes, that we turn. The tremendous\r\nhistorical importance of the career of Alexander the Great and of the\r\nwritings of Aristotle impressed itself perhaps even unduly upon both\r\nthe Arabian and the medieval mind. The personal connection between\r\nthe two men--Aristotle was for a time Alexander’s tutor--was seized\r\nupon and magnified. Pliny in his _Natural History_ had stated that\r\nAlexander had empowered Aristotle to send two thousand men to different\r\nparts of the world to test by experience all things on the face of the\r\nearth.[755] This account of their scientific co-operation was enlarged\r\nupon by spurious writings associated with their names like the letter\r\non the marvels of India.[756] With the introduction into western Europe\r\nin the twelfth and early thirteenth centuries of many genuine works of\r\nAristotle unknown to the early middle ages, which had possessed only\r\ncertain of his logical treatises, there also came into circulation a\r\nnumber of spurious writings ascribed to him.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Spurious writings ascribed to Aristotle.]\r\n\r\nIt is not surprising that many spurious works were attributed to\r\nAristotle in the middle ages, when we remember that his writings came\r\nto them for the most part indirectly through corrupt translations,\r\nand that some writing from so great a master was eagerly looked for\r\nupon every subject in which they were interested. It seemed to them\r\nthat so encyclopedic a genius must have touched on all fields of\r\nknowledge and they often failed to realize that in Aristotle’s time\r\nthe departments of learning had been somewhat different from their own\r\nand that new interests and doctrine had developed since then. There\r\nwas also a tendency to ascribe to Aristotle any work of unknown or\r\nuncertain authorship. At the close of the twelfth century Alexander\r\nNeckam[757] lists among historic instances of envy Aristotle’s holding\r\nback from posterity certain of his most subtle writings, which he\r\nordered should be buried with him. At the same time he so guarded\r\nthe place of his sepulcher, whether by some force of nature or power\r\nof art or prodigy of magic is uncertain, that no one has yet been\r\nable to approach it, although some think that Antichrist will be able\r\nto inspect these books when he comes. Roger Bacon in the thirteenth\r\ncentury believed that Aristotle had written over a thousand works and\r\ncomplained bitterly because certain treatises, which were probably\r\nreally apocryphal, had not been translated into Latin.[758] Indeed,\r\nsome of the works ascribed to Aristotle in the Oriental and Mohammedan\r\nworlds were never translated into Latin, such as the astrological\r\n_De impressionibus coelestibus_ which Bacon mentions, or the Syriac\r\ntext which K. Ahrens edited in 1892 with a German translation as\r\n“Das Buch der Naturgegenstände”; or first appeared in Latin guise\r\nafter the invention of printing, as was the case with the so-called\r\n_Theology_ of Aristotle,[759] a work which was little more than a\r\nseries of extracts from the _Enneads_ of Plotinus.[760] Some treatises\r\nattributed to Aristotle in medieval Latin do not bear especially upon\r\nour investigation, such as _Grammar_ which Grosseteste is said to have\r\ntranslated from Greek.[761]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Aristotle and experiment.]\r\n\r\nFor our purposes the Pseudo-Aristotelian writings may be sub-divided\r\nunder seven heads: experiment, alchemy, astrology, spirits, occult\r\nvirtues of stones and herbs, chiromancy and physiognomy, and last the\r\nfamous _Secret of Secrets_. Under the first of these heads may be put\r\na treatise on the conduct of waters, which consists of a series of\r\nexperiments in siphoning and the like illustrated in the manuscript by\r\nlettered and colored figures and diagrams.[762] In a Vatican manuscript\r\nit is perhaps more correctly ascribed to Philo of Byzantium.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Aristotle and alchemy: _Meteorology_ and _On colors_.]\r\n\r\nFrom experiment to alchemy is an easy step, for the alchemists\r\nexperimented a good deal in the period which we are now considering.\r\nThe fourth book of the _Meteorology_ of Aristotle, which, if not a\r\ngenuine portion of that work, at least goes back to the third century\r\nbefore Christ,[763] has been called a manual of chemistry,[764] and\r\napparently is the oldest such extant. Its doctrines are also believed\r\nto have been influential in the development of alchemy; and there were\r\npassages in this fourth book which led men later to regard Aristotle\r\nas favorable to the doctrine of the transmutation of metals. Gerard of\r\nCremona had translated only the first three books of the _Meteorology_;\r\nthe fourth was supplied from a translation from the Greek made by\r\nHenricus Aristippus who died in 1162; to this fourth book were added\r\nthree chapters translated by Alfred of England or of Sareshel from\r\nthe Arabic,[765] apparently of Avicenna.[766] These additions of\r\nAlfred from Avicenna discussed the formation of metals but attacked\r\nthe alchemists.[767] Vincent of Beauvais[768] and Albertus Magnus[769]\r\nwere both aware, however, that this attack upon the alchemists was\r\nprobably not by Aristotle. The short treatise _On colors_,[770] which\r\nis included in so many medieval manuscript collections of the works of\r\nAristotle in Latin,[771] by its very title would suggest to medieval\r\nreaders that he had been interested in the art of alchemy, although its\r\nactual contents deal only in small part with dyes and tinctures. Its\r\nform and contents are not regarded as Aristotle’s, but it was perhaps\r\nby someone of the Peripatetic school. Thus works which, if not by\r\nAristotle himself, at least had been written in Greek long before the\r\nmedieval period, gave medieval readers the impression that Aristotle\r\nwas favorable to alchemy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Works of alchemy ascribed to Aristotle.]\r\n\r\nIt is therefore not surprising that works of alchemy appeared in\r\nmedieval Latin under Aristotle’s name. The names of Plato and Aristotle\r\nhad headed the lists of alchemists in Greek manuscripts although no\r\nworks ascribed to Aristotle have been preserved in the same.[772]\r\nBerthelot, however, speaks of a pseudo-Aristotle in Arabic,[773] and\r\nin an Oxford manuscript of the thirteenth century under the name of\r\nAristotle appears a treatise _On the twelve waters of the secret\r\nriver_ said to be “translated from Arabic into Latin.”[774] In the\r\npreface the author promises that whoever becomes skilled, adept, and\r\nexpert in these twelve waters will never lose hope nor be depressed by\r\nwant. He regards this treatise as the chief among his works, since he\r\nhas learned these waters by experiment. They are all chemical rather\r\nthan medical; a brief “chapter” or paragraph is devoted to each. In\r\nanother manuscript at the Bodleian two brief tracts are ascribed\r\nto Aristotle; one describes the seven metals, the other deals with\r\ntransmutation.[775] In a single manuscript at Munich both a theoretical\r\ntreatise in medicine and alchemy and a _Practica_ are attributed to\r\nAristotle, and in two other manuscripts he is credited with the _Book\r\nof Seventy Precepts_ which sometimes is ascribed to Geber.[776] Thomas\r\nof Cantimpré cites Aristotle in the _Lumen luminum_ as saying that\r\nthe best gold is made from yellow copper ore and the urine of a boy,\r\nbut Thomas hastens to add that such gold is best in color rather\r\nthan in substance.[777] The translation of the _Lumen luminum_ is\r\nascribed both to Michael Scot and brother Elias.[778] Aristotle is\r\nquoted several times in _De alchimia_, ascribed to Albertus Magnus,\r\nbut only in the later “Additions” to it, where Roger Bacon also is\r\ncited, is the specific title _Liber de perfecto magisterio_ given as\r\nAristotle’s.[779] Sometimes works of alchemy were very carelessly\r\nascribed to Aristotle, when it is perfectly evident from the works\r\nthemselves that they could not have been written by him.[780]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Aristotle and Alexander as alchemists.]\r\n\r\nThe alchemical discoveries and writings ascribed to Aristotle are\r\noften associated in some way with Alexander the Great as well. In one\r\nmanuscript John of Spain’s translation of the _Secret of Secrets_ is\r\nfollowed by a description of the virtues and compositions of four\r\nstones “which Aristotle sent to Alexander the Great.”[781] It seems\r\nobvious that these are philosopher’s stones and not natural gems.\r\nThe _Liber ignium_ of Marcus Grecus, composed in the thirteenth or\r\nearly fourteenth century, ascribes to Aristotle the discovery of two\r\nmarvelous kinds of fires. One, which he discovered while traveling with\r\nAlexander the king, will burn for a year without cessation. The other,\r\nin the composition of which observance of the dog-days is requisite,\r\n“Aristotle asserts will last for nine years.”[782] A collection of\r\nchemical experiments by a Nicholas, of whom we shall have more to\r\nsay in a later chapter, gives “a fire which Aristotle discovered\r\nwith Alexander for obscure places.”[783] A letter of Aristotle to\r\nAlexander in a collection of alchemical tracts is hardly worth noting,\r\nas it is only seven lines long, but it is interesting to observe that\r\nit cites Aristotle’s _Meteorology_.[784] Perhaps by a mistake one\r\nor two alchemical treatises are ascribed to Alexander rather than\r\nAristotle.[785]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Aristotle and astrology.]\r\n\r\nAristotle’s genuine works give even more encouragement to the\r\npretensions of astrology than to those of alchemy. His opinion that\r\nthe four elements were insufficient to explain natural phenomena\r\nand his theory of a fifth essence were favorable to the belief in\r\noccult virtue and the influence of the stars upon inferior objects.\r\nIn his work on generation[786] he held that the elements alone were\r\nmere tools without a workman; the missing agent is supplied by the\r\nrevolution of the heavens. In the twelfth book of the _Metaphysics_ he\r\ndescribed the stars and planets as eternal and acting as intermediaries\r\nbetween the prime Mover and inferior beings. Thus they are the direct\r\ncauses of all life and action in our world. Charles Jourdain regarded\r\nthe introduction of the _Metaphysics_ into western Europe at the\r\nopening of the thirteenth century as a principal cause for the great\r\nprevalence of astrology from that time on, the other main cause being\r\nthe translation of Arabian astrological treatises.[787] Jourdain did\r\nnot duly appreciate the great hold which astrology already had in the\r\ntwelfth century, but it is nevertheless true that in the new Aristotle\r\nastrology found further support.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Astrology and magic in the _Theology_ and _De pomo_ of\r\nAristotle.]\r\n\r\nAstrology crops out here and there in most of the spurious works\r\nextant under Aristotle’s name, just as it does in medieval learning\r\neverywhere. One section of a dozen pages in the _Theology_ discusses\r\nthe influence of the stars upon nature and the working of magic by\r\nmaking use of these celestial forces and the natural attraction which\r\nthings have for one another. It regards artificial magic as a fraud\r\nbut natural and astrological magic as a reality. However, as in the\r\noriginal text of Plotinus which the _Theology_ follows, it is only the\r\nanimal soul which is affected by magic and the man of impulse who is\r\nmoved thereby; the thinking man can free himself from its influence by\r\nuse of the rational soul. In the treatise, _De pomo_,[788] which seems\r\nnot to have been translated into Latin until the thirteenth century\r\nunder Manfred,[789] Aristotle on his death bed, holding in his hand\r\nan apple from which the treatise takes its title, is represented\r\nas telling his disciples why a philosopher need not fear death and\r\nrepudiating the doctrines of the mortality of the soul and eternity\r\nof the universe. He also tells how the Creator made the spheres and\r\nplaced lucid stars in each and gave them the virtue of ruling over\r\nthis inferior world and causing good and evil and life or death. They\r\ndo not, however, do this of themselves, but men at first thought so\r\nand erroneously worshiped the stars until the time of Noah who was the\r\nfirst to recognize the Creator of the spheres.[790]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Liber de causis proprietatum elementorum et planetarum._]\r\n\r\nThere are also attributed to Aristotle treatises primarily\r\nastrological. A “Book on the Properties of the Elements and of the\r\nPlanets” is cited under his name by Peter of Abano at the end of the\r\nthirteenth century in his work on poisons,[791] by Peter d’Ailly in his\r\n_Vigintiloquium_[792] written in 1414, and by Pico della Mirandola,\r\nwho declares it spurious, in his work against astrology written at the\r\nclose of the fifteenth century. D’Ailly and Pico cite it in regard to\r\nthe theory of great conjunctions; Abano, for a tale of Socrates and\r\ntwo dragons which we shall repeat later. It is probable that all these\r\ncitations were from the paraphrase of and commentary on the work by\r\nAlbertus Magnus[793] who accepted it as a genuine writing of Aristotle.\r\nWe shall consider its contents in our chapter upon Albertus Magnus.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Other astrological treatises ascribed to Aristotle.]\r\n\r\nIn a manuscript of the Cotton collection in the British Museum is a\r\nwork of some length upon astrology ascribed to Aristotle.[794] After\r\na discussion of general principles in which the planets, signs, and\r\nhouses are treated, there are separate books upon the subjects of\r\nnativities,[795] and of elections and interrogations.[796] In a Paris\r\nmanuscript a treatise on interrogations is ascribed in a marginal\r\nheading to “Aristoteles Milesius, a Peripatetic physician.”[797] In\r\nthe Cotton Manuscript in commentaries which then follow, and which\r\nare labelled as commentaries “upon the preceding treatise” Ptolemy is\r\nmentioned rather than Aristotle.[798] In an astrological manuscript\r\nof the fifteenth century at Grenoble written in French, works of\r\nMessahala and Zaël translated for Charles V of France are preceded by\r\n“a book of judicial astrology according to Aristotle,” which opens\r\nwith “the preface of the last translator,” and is in four parts.[799]\r\nPerhaps both the above-mentioned manuscripts contain, like a third\r\nmanuscript at Munich, “The book of judgments which is said by Albert\r\nin his _Speculum_ to be Aristotle’s.”[800] This work also occurs in\r\na manuscript at Erfurt.[801] Roger Bacon was much impressed by an\r\nastrological treatise ascribed to Aristotle entitled _De impressionibus\r\ncoelestibus_, and told Pope Clement IV that it was “superior to\r\nthe entire philosophy of the Latins and can be translated by your\r\norder.”[802]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Aristotle and two hundred and fifty volumes of the Indians.]\r\n\r\nA treatise found in two manuscripts of the Bodleian Library bears\r\nthe titles, _Commentary of Aristotle on Astrology_, and _The book of\r\nAristotle from two hundred and fifty-five volumes of the Indians,\r\ncontaining a digest of all problems, whether pertaining to the sphere\r\nor to genethlialogy_.[803] From the text itself and the preface of\r\nHugo Sanctelliensis, the twelfth century translator from Arabic into\r\nLatin, addressed to his lord, Michael, bishop of Tarazona, we see\r\nthat the work is neither entirely by Aristotle nor from the books of\r\nthe Indians but is a compilation by someone who draws or pretends to\r\ndraw from some 250 or 255 books[804] of the philosophers, including in\r\naddition to treatises by both Aristotle and the Indians, 13 books by\r\nHermes, 13 by Doronius (Dorotheus?), 4 by Ptolemy, one by Democritus,\r\ntwo by Plato, 44 by the Babylonians, 7 by Antiochus, and others by\r\nauthors whose names are unfamiliar to me and probably misspelled in\r\nthe manuscripts. In one of the works of Aristotle of which the present\r\nwork is supposed to make use, there are said to have been described the\r\nnativities of twelve thousand men, collected in an effort to establish\r\nan experimental basis for astrology.[805] It is not so surprising that\r\nthe present work bears Aristotle’s name, since Hugh had promised his\r\npatron Michael, in the prologue to his translation of the _Geometry_ of\r\nHanus ben Hanne,[806] that if life endured and opportunity was given he\r\nwould next set to work as ordered by his patron, not only upon Haly’s\r\ncommentaries on the _Quadripartite_ and _Almagest_ of Ptolemy, but also\r\nupon a certain general commentary by Aristotle on the entire art of\r\nastrology.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Works on astrological images.]\r\n\r\nThe _Secret of Secrets_ of the Pseudo-Aristotle is immediately followed\r\nin one manuscript by chapters or treatises addressed to Alexander and\r\nentitled, _Of ideas and forms_, _Of the impression of forms_, and\r\n_Of images and rings_.[807] The theory, very like that of Alkindi,\r\nis maintained that “all forms are ruled by supercelestial forms\r\nthrough the spirits of the spheres” and that incantations and images\r\nreceive their force from the spheres. The seven planets pass on these\r\nsupercelestial ideas and forms to our inferior world. By selecting\r\nproper times for operating one can work good or ill by means of the\r\nrays and impressions of the planets. The scientific investigator\r\nwho properly concentrates and fixes intent, desire, and appetite\r\nupon the desired goal can penetrate hidden secrets of secrets and\r\noccult science both universal and particular. The writer goes on to\r\nemphasize the importance of understanding all the different positions\r\nand relationships of the heavenly bodies and also the distribution\r\nof terrestrial objects under the planets. He then describes an\r\nastrological image which will cause men to reverence and obey you, will\r\nrepel your enemies in terror, afflict the envious, send visions, and\r\nperform other marvelous and stupefying feats too numerous to mention.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: And on necromantic images.]\r\n\r\nAs the _Speculum astronomiae_ of Albertus Magnus listed a _Book\r\nof Judgments_ by Aristotle among deserving works of astronomy and\r\nastrology, so in its list of evil books dealing with necromantic\r\nimages appear a treatise by Hermes addressed to Aristotle and opening,\r\n“Aristotle said, ‘You have seen me, O Hermes,’” and a treatise ascribed\r\nto Aristotle with the sinister title, _Death of the Soul_, opening,\r\n“Said Aristotle to King Alexander, ‘If you want to perceive.’” This\r\ntreatise the _Speculum_ calls “the worst of all” the evil books on\r\nimages. Roger Bacon, too, alludes to it by title as filled with\r\nfigments of the magicians, but does not name Aristotle as author.[808]\r\nPeter of Abano in his _Lucidator_ follows the _Speculum astronomiae_ in\r\nlisting it among depraved, obscene, and detestable works.[809]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Alexander as an astrologer.]\r\n\r\nAlexander himself, as well as Aristotle, had some medieval reputation\r\nas an astrologer. We have already seen[810] in the tenth and eleventh\r\ncentury manuscripts of the _Mathematica_ of Alhandreus, supreme\r\nastrologer, that “Alexander of Macedon” was more than once cited as an\r\nauthority, and that there were also given “Excerpts from the books of\r\nAlexander, astrologer, king,” and a “Letter of Argafalan to Alexander.”\r\nDifferent from this, moreover, was the _Mathematica_ of Alexander,\r\nsupreme astrologer, found in a thirteenth century manuscript, in which\r\nfrom the movements of the planets through the signs one is instructed\r\nhow to foretell prosperous and adverse journeys, abundance and poverty,\r\nmisfortune or death of a friend, or to discover stolen articles,\r\nsorceries, buried treasure and so forth.[811] A treatise on seven herbs\r\nrelated to the seven planets is sometimes ascribed to Alexander,[812]\r\nbut perhaps more often to Flaccus Africanus, as we saw in Chapter 46,\r\nand at least once to Aristotle.[813]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Aristotle and spirits.]\r\n\r\nThe association of astrological images with spirits of the spheres in\r\none of the above-mentioned works ascribed to Aristotle has already\r\nbrought us to the border-line of our next topic, Aristotle and spirits.\r\nUnder this caption may be placed a work found in a fifteenth century\r\nmanuscript.[814] It also is in part astrological and is associated\r\nwith the name of Hermes as well as of Aristotle. Its title runs, _The\r\nbook of the spiritual works of Aristotle, or the book Antimaquis,\r\nwhich is the book of the secrets of Hermes: wonderful things can\r\nbe accomplished by means of this book and ’tis the ancient book of\r\nthe seven planets_. The treatise opens, “To every people and clime\r\npertains a group of spirits.” It then maps out these regions of\r\ndifferent spirits in accordance with the planets and signs of the\r\nzodiac. Apparently this is the same work as that which Hunain ibn\r\nIshak translated into Arabic and of which he says, “Among the works of\r\nAristotle which we have found and translated from Greek into Arabic was\r\n_The book of the Causes of Spirituals_ which has Hermes for author....\r\nIt is the book in which Aristotle treats of the causes of spirituals,\r\ntalismans, the art of their operation, and how to hinder it, ordered\r\nafter the seven climates.”[815] It was probably some such spurious work\r\nthat William of Auvergne had in mind when he spoke of Aristotle’s boast\r\nthat a spirit had descended unto him from the sphere of Venus.[816]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _On plants_ and the _Lapidary_.]\r\n\r\nNo genuine work of Aristotle on vegetables or minerals has come down to\r\nus to accompany his celebrated _History of Animals_, but supposititious\r\nwritings were soon found by the Arabs to fill this gap. On plants a\r\nbrief treatise by Nicolaus Damascenus passed for Aristotle’s. Alfred of\r\nSarchel translated it from Arabic into Latin,[817] presumably before\r\nthe close of the twelfth century, since he dedicated it to Roger of\r\nHereford, and Albertus Magnus expanded its two short books into seven\r\nlong ones in his _De vegetabilibus et plantis_. There also existed\r\nin Arabic a _Lapidary_ ascribed to Aristotle,[818] which we have\r\nheard cited in the ninth century by Costa ben Luca. Ruska believes\r\nthe work to be of Syrian and Persian origin,[819] although one Latin\r\ntext professes to have been originally translated from Greek into\r\nSyriac.[820] Valentin Rose regarded it as the basis of all subsequent\r\nArabic mineralogy, but found only two Latin manuscripts of it.[821]\r\nAlbertus Magnus in his _Minerals_ confesses that, although he had\r\nsought diligently in divers regions of the world, he had seen only\r\nexcerpts from Aristotle’s work. But another writer of the thirteenth\r\ncentury, Arnold of Saxony, cites translations of Aristotle on stones\r\nboth by Dioscorides, which would seem sheer nonsense, and by Gerard,\r\npresumably of Cremona. Gerard’s translation occurs in one of Rose’s\r\nmanuscripts; the other seems to give a version translated from the\r\nHebrew.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Virtues of gems.]\r\n\r\nIn Gerard’s translation, a work marked by puerile Latin style,\r\nthe _Lapidary_ of Aristotle is about equally devoted to marvelous\r\nproperties of stones and tales of Alexander the Great. After some\r\ngeneral discussion of stones and their wonderful properties, particular\r\ngems are taken up. The _gesha_ brings misfortune. Its wearer sleeps\r\npoorly, has many worries, many altercations and law-suits. If it is\r\nhung about a boy’s neck, it makes him drivel. “There is great occult\r\nforce” in the magnet, and instructions are given how to set water on\r\nfire with it. Several stones possess the property of neutralizing\r\nspells and counteracting the work of demons. With another stone the\r\nIndians make many incantations. Vultures were the first to discover\r\nthe virtue of the stone _filcrum coarton_ in hastening delivery. When\r\na female vulture was near death from the eggs hardening in her body,\r\nthe male flew off to India and brought back this stone which afforded\r\ninstant relief. Another stone is so soporific that suspended about the\r\nneck it induces a sleep lasting three days and nights, and the effects\r\nof which are thrown off with difficulty even on the fourth day, when\r\nthe sleeper will awake but will act as if he were intoxicated and will\r\nstill seem sleepier than anyone else. Another stone prevents a horse\r\nfrom whinnying, if suspended from his neck.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Stories of Alexander and of Socrates.]\r\n\r\nOther gems suggest stories of Alexander. Near the frontier of India\r\nin a valley guarded by deadly serpents whose mere glance was fatal\r\nwere many precious gems. Alexander disposed of the serpents by\r\nerecting mirrors in which they might stare themselves to death, and\r\nhe then secured the gems by employing the carcasses of sheep in the\r\nmanner which we have already heard described by Epiphanius.[822] A\r\nsomewhat similar tale is told of Socrates by Albertus Magnus in his\r\ncommentary on the pseudo-Aristotelian work on the properties of the\r\nelements and planets.[823] In the reign of Philip of Macedon, who is\r\nhimself described as a philosopher and astronomer, the road between\r\ntwo mountains in Armenia became so poisoned that no one could pass.\r\nPhilip vainly inquired the cause from his sages until Socrates came\r\nto the rescue and, by erecting a tower as high as the mountains with\r\na steel mirror on top of it, saw two dragons polluting the air. The\r\nmere glance of these dragons was apparently not deadly, for men in\r\nair-tight armor went in and killed them. The same story is told by\r\nWilliam of St. Cloud, who composed astronomical tables based upon his\r\nown observations from about 1285 to 1321, in which he detected errors\r\nin the earlier tables of Thebit, Toulouse, and Toledo.[824] In Peter\r\nof Abano’s treatise on poisons,[825] however, although he too cites\r\nthe Pseudo-Aristotle _On the causes of the elements_, the mirror has\r\nbecome a glass cave in which Socrates ensconces himself to observe\r\nthe serpents. A _Lapidary_ dedicated to King Wenzel II of Bohemia\r\ntells of Socrates’ killing a dragon by use of quicksilver.[826] That\r\nSocrates also shared the medieval reputation of Aristotle and Plato\r\nfor astrology and divination we have already seen from the _Prenostica\r\nSocratis Basilei_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Alexander’s submarine.]\r\n\r\nSimilar to Abano’s tale of Socrates in the glass cave is the story\r\ntold a century earlier by Alexander Neckam of Alexander himself. So\r\nsedulous an investigator of nature was the Macedonian, says Neckam,\r\nthat he went down in a glass vessel to observe the natures and customs\r\nof the fishes. He would seem to have remained submerged for some time,\r\nsince Neckam informs us that he took a cock with him in order to tell\r\nwhen it was dawn by the bird’s crowing. This primitive submarine had at\r\nleast a suggestion of war about it, since Neckam goes on to say that\r\nAlexander learned how to lay ambushes against the foe by observing one\r\narmy of fishes attack another. Unfortunately, however, Alexander failed\r\nto commit to writing his observations, whether military or scientific,\r\nof deep-sea life; and Neckam grieves that very few data on the natures\r\nof fishes have come to his attention.[827] We shall hear Roger Bacon\r\ntell of Alexander’s descending to see the secrets of the deep on the\r\nauthority of Ethicus.[828]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Arabian tales of Alexander.]\r\n\r\nNeckam’s account differs a good deal from the story as told by the\r\nArabian historian, Masʿudi, in the tenth century. There we read that,\r\nwhen Alexander was building the city of Alexandria, monsters came from\r\nthe sea every night and overthrew the walls that had been built during\r\nthe day. Night watchmen proved of no avail, so Alexander had a box\r\nmade ten cubits long and five wide, with glass sides fastened into the\r\nframe work by means of pitch and resin. He then entered the box with\r\ntwo draughtsmen, who, after it had been let down to the bottom of the\r\nsea, made exact drawings of the monsters, who had human bodies but the\r\nheads of beasts. From these sketches Alexander had images constructed\r\nand placed on pillars, and these magic figures served to keep off the\r\nmonsters until the city was completed. But the effect apparently began\r\nto wear off and talismans had to be added on the pillars to prevent the\r\nmonsters from coming and devouring the inhabitants, as they had begun\r\nto do again.[829] Another Arab, Abu-Shâker, of the thirteenth century,\r\nrepeats a current tradition that Aristotle gave Alexander a box of wax\r\nsoldiers which were nailed, with inverted spears and swords and severed\r\nbow-strings, face-downwards in the box, which in its turn was fastened\r\nby a chain. As long as the box remained in Alexander’s possession and\r\nhe repeated the formulae which Aristotle taught him whenever he took\r\nthe box up or put it down, he would triumph over his foes in war.[830]\r\nThis reminds one of the methods of warfare employed by Alexander’s\r\nfabled natural father, Nectanebus.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A magic horn.]\r\n\r\nWhile we are speaking of military matters, it may be noted that in\r\na manuscript of the thirteenth century which once belonged to an\r\nAlbertus Bohemus or Beham, dean of the church at Padua, and seems to\r\nhave been his note-book, we find between the _Secret of Secrets_ of\r\nthe Pseudo-Aristotle and a treatise on the significations of the moon\r\nin the signs “a delineation of a brazen horn made with marvelous art\r\nby which Alexander in time of war summoned his army from a distance\r\nof sixty miles.”[831] Such a horn “of Temistius” is mentioned in some\r\nversions of the _Secret of Secrets_.[832]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: More stories of Alexander and gems.]\r\n\r\nBut to return to other tales of Alexander in the _Lapidary_. Once he\r\nsaw afar enchanters and enchantresses who slew and wounded the men of\r\nhis army by their diabolical power until Alexander prayed to God, who\r\nrevealed two stones which counteracted the sorcery. On another occasion\r\nwhen by Alexander’s order his barons had carried off certain gems,\r\nduring the night following they suffered much insult from demons and\r\nwere sore afraid, since sticks and stones were thrown about the camp by\r\nunseen hands and men were beaten without knowing whence the blows came.\r\nIt thus became apparent that the demons cherished those gems as their\r\nespecial property and were accustomed to perform occult operations with\r\nthem of which they did not wish men to learn the secret. Alexander\r\nfound that these gems would protect him from any beast, serpent, or\r\ndemon, although the nocturnal experience of his barons would scarcely\r\nseem to support this last point. On a third occasion his troops were\r\nheld motionless and gazed open-mouthed at certain stones, until a bird\r\nfluttered down and covered the gems with its outstretched wings. Then\r\nAlexander had his followers close their eyes and carry the stones away\r\nunder cover and place them on top of the wall of one of his cities so\r\nthat no one might scale the wall to spy upon the town.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Story of Alexander’s belt.]\r\n\r\nYet another curious story of Alexander and a stone is repeated by Peter\r\nof Abano in his work on poisons[833] from a treatise “On the Nature\r\nof Serpents” which he ascribes to Aristotle. Alexander always wore a\r\ncertain stone in his belt to give him good luck in his battles, but\r\non his return from India, while bathing in the Euphrates, he removed\r\nthe belt, whereupon a serpent suddenly appeared, bit the stone out of\r\nthe belt, and vomited it into the river. Deprived of his talisman,\r\nAlexander presently met his death.[834]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The royal _Lapidary_ of Wenzel II of Bohemia.]\r\n\r\nAnother _Lapidary_, printed as Aristotle’s at Merseburg in 1473, is\r\nreally a compilation of previous medieval works on the subject with\r\nthe addition of some items derived from the personal knowledge or\r\nexperience of the author. It was composed “to the honor of almighty God\r\nand the glory and perpetual memory of that virtuous and most glorious\r\nprince, Wenzel II, King of Bohemia” (1278-1305). As the treatise itself\r\nstates, “the Lapidary of Aristotle in the recent translation from the\r\nGreek” is only one of its sources along with Avicenna, Constantinus\r\nAfricanus, Albertus Magnus, and others.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Chiromancy_ and _Physiognomy of Aristotle_.]\r\n\r\nAnother work which claims Aristotelian authorship only in its title is\r\nthe _Chiromancy of Aristotle,_ printed at Ulm in 1490, which quotes\r\nfreely from Albertus Magnus and Avicenna. There are also brief tracts\r\non chiromancy ascribed to Aristotle in manuscripts of the thirteenth or\r\nfourteenth century.[835] Förster has identified Polemon as the author\r\nof the Greek treatise on physiognomy ascribed to Aristotle.[836] The\r\nart of physiognomy of course professed to read character from the\r\nface or other parts of the body, and chiromancy which we have just\r\nmentioned is really a branch of it. In Latin translation the treatise\r\nwas accepted as Aristotle’s by such medieval schoolmen as Albertus\r\nMagnus and Duns Scotus. There are many manuscripts of it in the\r\nBritish Museum, including one which perhaps dates back to the twelfth\r\ncentury.[837] Its popularity continued long after the invention of\r\nprinting, as is shown by separate editions of it brought out at Paris\r\nin 1535 and at Wittenberg in 1538, and by commentaries upon it[838]\r\npublished at Paris in 1611, at Bologna in 1621, and at Toulouse in\r\n1636. Besides such separate manuscripts and editions of it, it was also\r\nregularly embodied in the numerous copies of the pseudo-Aristotelian\r\nwork to which we next turn.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _The Secret of Secrets._]\r\n\r\nMost widely influential upon the medieval mind of all the spurious\r\nworks attributed to Aristotle was _The Secret of Secrets_. Förster\r\nenumerated two hundred and seven Latin manuscripts of it and his\r\nlist is probably far from complete.[839] Gaster calls it “The most\r\npopular book of the middle ages.”[840] This is not surprising since\r\nit purports to sum up in concise form what the greatest of ancient\r\nphilosophers deemed it essential for the greatest of ancient rulers\r\nto know, and since under the alluring pretense of revealing great\r\nsecrets in parable and riddle it really masses together a number of\r\nthe best-tested and most often repeated maxims of personal hygiene and\r\npractical philosophy, and some of the superstitions to which men have\r\nshown themselves most inclined. Every European library of consequence\r\ncontains a number of copies of it. It was translated into almost\r\nevery European language and was often versified, as in Lydgate’s and\r\nBurgh’s _Secrees of old Philisoffres_.[841] Albertus Magnus cited it\r\nas Aristotle’s;[842] Roger Bacon wrote a rather jejune commentary upon\r\nit.[843] It was printed a number of times before 1500.[844]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Its textual history.]\r\n\r\nThe _Secrets of Secrets_ is believed to be the outcome of a gradual\r\nprocess of compilation from very varied sources, and to have reached\r\nsomething like its present form by the seventh or eighth century of\r\nour era. But its chapters on physiognomy, as we have seen, go back\r\nto Polemon’s treatise, and part of its medical discussion is said\r\nto be borrowed from Diocles Caristes who wrote about 320 B. C. Some\r\nGraeco-Persian treatise is thought to be the basis of its discussion\r\nof kingship. It is also believed to have appropriated bits from\r\npopular literature to its own uses. In Arabic there is extant both\r\na longer and a shorter version, and Gaster has edited a Hebrew text\r\nwhich is apparently derived from an Arabic original different from\r\nthat of any Latin text. The process of successive compilation, or at\r\nleast, re-editing and repeated translation which the work underwent\r\nis suggested by a series of prologues which occur at the beginning.\r\nFollowing the preface of the Latin translator and the table of contents\r\ncomes what is called “the prologue of a certain doctor in commendation\r\nof Aristotle,”[845] in which omnipotent God is prayed to guard the\r\nking and some anonymous editor states that he has executed the mandate\r\nenjoined upon him to procure the moral work on royal conduct called\r\n_The Secret of Secrets_, which Aristotle, chief of philosophers,\r\ncomposed. After some talk about Aristotle and Alexander a second\r\nprologue begins with the sentence, “John who translated this book, son\r\nof a patrician, most skilful and faithful interpreter of languages,\r\nsays.” This John appears to have been Yuhanna ibn el-Batrik, or Ibn\r\nYahya al-Batrik, who died in 815 A. D.[846] What he says is that he\r\nsearched the world over until he came to an oracle of the sun which\r\nEsculapides had constructed. There he found a solitary abstemious\r\nsage who presented him with this book which he translated from Greek\r\ninto Chaldaic and thence into Arabic. This passage reminds one of\r\nHarpocration’s prefatory remarks to his daughter in the _Kiranides_;\r\nindeed, it is quite in the usual style of apocryphal writings.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Latin translations of John of Spain and Philip.]\r\n\r\nIn the matter of the Latin translation we are on somewhat more certain\r\nground. John of Spain in the first half of the twelfth century seems\r\nto have translated only the medical portion.[847] Manuscripts of this\r\npartial translation are relatively few,[848] and it was presently\r\nsuperseded by the complete translation made either in the twelfth or\r\nearly thirteenth century[849] by Philip, “the least of his clerics” for\r\n“his most excellent lord, most strenuous in the cult of the Christian\r\nreligion, Guido of Valencia, glorious pontiff of the city of Tripoli.”\r\nPhilip goes on to say in his dedicatory preface that it was when he was\r\nwith Guido in Antioch that they found “this pearl of philosophy, ...\r\nthis book which contains something useful about almost every science,”\r\nand which it pleased Guido to have translated from Arabic into Latin.\r\nAlthough the various printed editions and manuscripts of _The Secret\r\nof Secrets_ in Latin vary considerably, they regularly are preceded\r\nby this ascription of the Latin translation to Philip, and usually\r\nby the other prologues afore-mentioned. Who this Philip was, other\r\nthan a cleric of Tripoli, is still undetermined. If he was the same\r\nas the papal physician whom Alexander III in 1177 proposed to send on\r\na mission to Prester John,[850] he had probably made his translation\r\nbefore that date. J. Wood Brown would identify him with Philip of\r\nSalerno, a royal notary whose name appears in 1200 on deeds in the\r\nkingdom of Sicily.[851] I have already suggested that possibly he\r\ntranslated the _Kiranides_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Philip’s preface.]\r\n\r\nReturning to Philip’s preface to Guido, it may be noted that he\r\nstates that Latins do not have the work, and that it is rare among\r\nthe Arabs.[852] His translation is a free one since the Arabic idiom\r\nis different from the Latin. Aristotle wrote this book in response\r\nto the petition of King Alexander his disciple who demanded that\r\nAristotle should either come to him or faithfully reveal the secrets of\r\ncertain arts, namely, the motion, operation, and power of the stars in\r\nastronomy, the art of alchemy, the art of knowing natures and working\r\nenchantments, and the art of geomancy. Aristotle was too old to come in\r\nperson, and although it had been his intention to conceal in every way\r\nthe secrets of the said sciences, yet he did not venture to contradict\r\nthe will and command of so great a lord. He hid some matters, however,\r\nunder enigmas and figurative locutions. For Alexander’s convenience he\r\ndivided the work into ten books, each of which is divided into chapters\r\nand headings. Philip adds that for his readers’ convenience he has\r\ncollected these headings at the beginning of the work, and a table of\r\ncontents follows.[853] Then come the two older prologues which we\r\nhave already described, next a letter of Aristotle to Alexander on\r\nthe extrinsic and intrinsic causes of his work,[854] and then with\r\na chapter which is usually headed _Distinctio regum_ or _Reges sunt\r\nquatuor_ begins the discussion of kingship which is the backbone of the\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Prominence of occult science.]\r\n\r\nIt is evident from Philip’s preface that occult science also forms a\r\nleading feature in the work as known to him. Gaster, who contended\r\nthat the Hebrew translation from the Arabic which he edited was as old\r\nas either John of Spain’s or Philip’s Latin translations, although\r\nthe oldest of the four manuscripts which he collated for his text is\r\ndated only in 1382 A. D., made a rather misleading statement when he\r\naffirmed, “Of the astrology looming so largely in the later European\r\nrecensions the Hebrew has only a faint trace.”[855] As a matter of fact\r\nsome of the printed editions contain less astrology than the thirteenth\r\ncentury manuscripts, while Gaster’s Hebrew version has much more than\r\n“a faint trace” of astrology. But more of this later.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Absence of mysticism.]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I cannot fully subscribe to Steinschneider’s\r\ncharacterization of _The Secret of Secrets_ as “a wretched compilation\r\nof philosophical mysticism and varied superstition.”[856] Of\r\nsuperstition there is a great deal, but of philosophical mysticism\r\nthere is practically none. Despite the title and the promise in\r\nPhilip’s preface of enigmatic and figurative language, the tone of the\r\ntext is seldom mystical, and its philosophy is of a very practical sort.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Discussion of kingship.]\r\n\r\nNor can _The Secret of Secrets_ be dismissed as merely “a wretched\r\ncompilation.” Those portions which deal with kingcraft and government\r\ndisplay shrewdness and common sense, worldly wisdom and knowledge of\r\nhuman nature, are not restricted by being written from any one premise\r\nor view-point, and often evince real enlightenment. Those historians\r\nwho have declared the love of fame a new product of the Italian\r\nRenaissance should have read the chapter on fame in this most popular\r\nbook of the middle ages, where we find such statements as that royal\r\npower ought not to be desired for its own sake but for the sole purpose\r\nof achieving fame. Other noteworthy utterances indicative of the tone\r\nand thought of the book are that “the intellect ... is the root of all\r\nthings praiseworthy”; that kings should cultivate the sciences; that\r\nliberality involves respect for others’ property; that “war destroys\r\norder and devastates the lands and turns everything to chaos”; that no\r\nearthly ruler should shed blood, which is reserved for God alone, but\r\nlimit his punishments to imprisonment, flogging, and torture; that the\r\nking, as Chief Justice Coke later told James I, is under the law; that\r\ntaxes upon merchants should be light so that they will remain in the\r\ncountry and contribute to its prosperity; that his people are a king’s\r\ntrue treasury and that he should acquaint himself with their needs and\r\nwatch over their interests.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Medical discussion.]\r\n\r\nFrom the medical passages of the book one would infer that the art\r\nof healing at first developed more slowly than the art of ruling in\r\nthe world’s history. The medical theory of _The Secret of Secrets_ is\r\nnot of an advanced or complex sort, but is a combination of curious\r\nnotions, such as that vomiting once a month or oftener is beneficial,\r\nand sensible ideas, such as that life consists of natural heat and that\r\nit is very important to keep the abdomen warm and the bowels moving\r\nregularly. Turkish baths are described for perhaps the first time in\r\nEurope, and Alexander is advised to keep his teeth and mouth clean. The\r\nwell-known apothegm of Hippocrates is quoted, “I would rather eat to\r\nlive than live to eat,” and Alexander is advised to cease eating while\r\nhe still has an appetite.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Astrology.]\r\n\r\nMuch of the advice offered to Alexander by Aristotle in _The Secret\r\nof Secrets_ is astrological. Among those studies which the king\r\nshould promote, the only one specifically mentioned is astrology,\r\nwhich considers “the course of the year and of the stars, the coming\r\nfestivals and solemnities of the month, the course of the planets, the\r\ncause of the shortening and lengthening of days and nights, the signs\r\nof the stars which determine the future and many other things which\r\npertain to prediction of the future.”[857] Alexander is adjured “not to\r\nrise up or sit down or eat or drink or do anything without consulting\r\na man skilled in the art of astronomy.”[858] Later the two parts of\r\nastronomy are distinguished, that is, astronomy and astrology in our\r\nsense of the words. Alexander is further warned to put no faith in the\r\nutterances of those stupid persons who declare that the science of the\r\nstars is too difficult to master. No less stupid is the argument of\r\nothers who affirm that God has foreseen and foreordained everything\r\nfrom eternity and that consequently all things happen of necessity\r\nand it is therefore of no advantage to predict events which cannot be\r\navoided. For even if things happened of necessity, it would be easier\r\nto bear them by foreknowing and preparing for them beforehand, just\r\nas men make preparations against the coming of a cold winter--the\r\nfamiliar contention of Ptolemy. But _The Secret of Secrets_ also\r\nbelieves that one should pray God in His mercy to avert future evils\r\nand ordain otherwise, “For He has not so ordained things that to ordain\r\notherwise derogates in any respect from His Providence.” But this is\r\nnot so approved astrological doctrine. Later in the work Alexander\r\nis once more urged never to take medicine or open a vein except with\r\nthe approval of his astronomers,[859] and directions are given as to\r\nthe constellations under which bleeding should be performed and also\r\nconcerning the taking of laxatives with reference to the position of\r\nthe moon in the signs of the zodiac.[860] Later the work discusses\r\nthe relations of the four elements and of various herbs to the seven\r\nplanets,[861] and in the next to last chapter Alexander is advised to\r\nconduct his wars under the guidance of astrology.[862]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Story of the two boys.]\r\n\r\nThere is much indulging in astrological theory in the midst of the\r\nchapter on Justice, and the constitution of the universe is set forth\r\nfrom the first and highest simple spiritual substance down through the\r\nnine heavens and spheres to the lowest inferiors. To illustrate the\r\npower of the stars the story is presently told of two boys,[863] one a\r\nweaver’s son, the other a royal prince of India. Sages who were chance\r\nguests in the weaver’s house at the time of the child’s birth noted\r\nthat his horoscope was that of a courtier high in royal councils but\r\nkept their discovery to themselves. The boy’s parents vainly tried to\r\nmake a weaver of him, but even beatings were in vain; he was finally\r\nallowed to follow his natural inclination, secured an education, and\r\nbecame in time a royal governor. The king’s son, on the contrary,\r\ndespite his royal birth and the fact that his father sent him through\r\nall his provinces to learn the sciences, would take no interest in\r\nanything except mechanics conformably to his horoscope.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Virtues of stones and herbs, incantations and amulets.]\r\n\r\nIn _The Secret of Secrets_ the Pseudo-Aristotle refers Alexander\r\nfor the virtues of gems and herbs to his treatises on stones and\r\nplants, presumably those which we have already described. He does not\r\nentirely refrain from discussion of such marvelous properties in the\r\npresent work, however, mentioning the use of the virtues of stones in\r\nconnection with incantations. We also again hear of stones which will\r\nprevent any army from withstanding Alexander or which will cause horses\r\nto whinny or keep them from doing so; and of herbs which bring true or\r\nfalse dreams or cause joy, love, hate, honor, reverence, courage, and\r\ninertia.[864] One recipe reads, “If you take in the name of someone\r\nseven grains of the seeds of the herb called androsimon, and hold\r\nthem in his name when Lucifer and Venus are rising so that their rays\r\ntouch him (or them?), and if you give him those seven grains to eat\r\nor pulverized in drink, fear of you will ever abide in his heart and\r\nhe will obey you for the rest of his life.”[865] The discussion of\r\nincantations, astrological images, and amulets is omitted from many\r\nLatin manuscripts but occurs in Roger Bacon’s version.[866]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Thirteenth century scepticism.]\r\n\r\nThe extreme powers attributed to herbs and stones in _The Secret\r\nof Secrets_ aroused some scepticism among its Latin readers of the\r\nthirteenth century.[867] Geoffrey of Waterford, a Dominican from\r\nIreland who died about 1300, translated _The Secret of Secrets_ into\r\nFrench. He criticized, however, its assertions concerning the virtues\r\nof stones and herbs as more akin to fables than to philosophy, a fact\r\nof which, he adds, all clerks who know Latin well are aware. He wonders\r\nwhy Alexander had to win his battles by hard fighting when Aristotle is\r\nsupposed to inform him in this book of a stone which will always rout\r\nthe enemy. Geoffrey decides that such false statements are the work of\r\nthe translators and that Aristotle is the author only of what is well\r\nsaid or reasonable in the work.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Number and alchemy.]\r\n\r\nSomething is said in _The Secret of Secrets_ of the occult properties\r\nand relative perfection of numbers, and as usual the preference is\r\nfor the numbers, three, four, seven, and ten.[868] The Hebrew version\r\nadds a puerile method of divining who will be victor in a battle by\r\na numerical calculation based upon the letters in the names of the\r\ngenerals. The Latin versions of the thirteenth century contain a\r\nchapter on alchemy which had great influence and gives a recipe for the\r\nphilosopher’s stone and the Emerald Table of Hermes.[869] But in the\r\nHebrew version and Achillini’s printed text occurs a passage in which\r\nAlexander is warned that alchemy is not a true science.[870]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The poisonous maiden.]\r\n\r\nWe may conclude our picture of the work’s contents with two of its\r\nstories, namely, concerning the poisonous maiden and the Jew and the\r\nMagus. A beautiful maiden was sent from India to Alexander with other\r\nrich gifts. But she had been fed upon poison from infancy “until she\r\nwas of the nature of a snake. And had I not perceived it,” continues\r\nAristotle in the Hebrew version, “for I suspected the clever men of\r\nthose countries and their craft, and had I not found by tests that she\r\nwould kill thee by her embrace and by her perspiration, she surely\r\nwould have killed thee.”[871] This venomous maiden is also alluded to\r\nin various medieval discussions of poisons. Peter of Abano mentions\r\nher in his _De venenis_.[872] Gilbert of England, following no doubt\r\nGerard of Cremona’s translation of Avicenna, cites Ruffus rather than\r\nthe Pseudo-Aristotle concerning her and says nothing of her relations\r\nwith Alexander, but adds that animals who approached her spittle were\r\nkilled by it.[873] In _Le Secret aux philosophes_, a French work of the\r\nclosing thirteenth century, where the story is told at considerable\r\nlength, Socrates rather than Aristotle saves Alexander from the\r\npoisonous maid.[874]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Jew and the Magus.]\r\n\r\nIn the other story a Magus is represented in a much more favorable\r\nlight than magicians generally were; he seems to represent rather one\r\nof the Persian sages. He was traveling on a mule with provisions and\r\nmet a Jew traveling on foot. Their talk soon turned to their respective\r\nreligions and moral standards. The Magus professed altruism; the Jew\r\nwas inclined to get the better of all men except Jews. When these\r\nprinciples had been stated, the Jew requested the Magus, since he\r\nprofessed to observe the law of love, to dismount and let him ride\r\nthe mule. No sooner had this been done than the Jew, true to his law\r\nof selfishness and hate, made off with both mule and provisions. This\r\nmisfortune did not lead the Magus to lose his faith in God, however,\r\nand as he plodded along he by and by came again upon the Jew who had\r\nfallen off the mule and broken his neck. The Magus then mercifully\r\nbrought the Jew to the nearest town where he died, while the king of\r\nthe country made the Magus one of his trusted ministers of state.[875]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[755] See Roger Bacon’s allusion to this passage in F.

F. Dieterici translated it from\r\nArabic into German in 1883, after publishing the Arabic text for the\r\nfirst time in 1882. For divergences between this Arabic text and the\r\nLatin one of 1519, and citation of Baumgartner that the _Theology_ was\r\nknown in Latin translation as early as 1200, see Grabmann (1916), pp.\r\n245-7.\r\n\r\n[760] Indeed Carra de Vaux, _Avicenne_, p. 73, says, “Tout un livre qui\r\nne contient en réalité que des extraits des Ennéades IV à VI de Plotin.”\r\n\r\n[761] See Arundel MS 165, 14th century.

Shute,\r\n_History of the Aristotelian Writings_, Oxford, 1888. It is, however,\r\na difficult subject and for the middle ages at least has not been\r\nsatisfactorily investigated. Grabmann (1916) devotes only a page or two\r\nof supplement to it; see pp. 248-51. A work on Aristotle in the middle\r\nages, announced in 1904 by G. H.

Not content with this thesis, which is easier to\r\nsuggest than to prove, Hammer-Jensen contends that it was a work of\r\nStrato’s youth and that it profoundly influenced Aristotle himself in\r\nhis last works. “The convenient Strato!” as he is called by Loveday and\r\nForster in the preface to their translation of _De coloribus_ (1913)\r\nvol.

And in the same edition the\r\nchapter headings given in the course of the text may not agree with\r\nthose in the table of contents, which as a rule, even in the MSS, does\r\nnot fully cover the subject-matter of the text. The different printers\r\nhave probably used different manuscripts for their editions rather than\r\nmade any new additions of their own. The following editions are those\r\nto which references will be made in the following pages.\r\n\r\nAn edition printed at Cologne about 1480, which I examined at the\r\nHarvard University Library, divides the text into only thirty chapters\r\nand seems imperfect.\r\n\r\nAn edition of about 1485, which I examined at the British Museum, where\r\nit was numbered IA.10756, has 74 chapters, and the headings of its 25th\r\nand 30th chapters, for instance, agree with those of the 11th and 13th\r\nchapters in the Harvard copy.\r\n\r\nA third edition of Paris, 1520, has no numbered chapters and contains\r\npassages not found in the two earlier editions.\r\n\r\nAs a check upon these printed texts I have examined the three following\r\nMSS, two of the 13th, and one of the 14th, century. Of these Egerton\r\n2676 corresponds fairly closely throughout to the edition numbered\r\nIA.10756 in the British Museum.\r\n\r\nEgerton 2676, 13th century, fols. 3-52.\r\n\r\nBN 6584, 13th century, fols. 1r-32v.\r\n\r\nBodleian 67, 14th century, fols. 1-53v, is much like the preceding MS.\r\n\r\n[845] BN 6584, fol. 1v, “De prologo cuiusdam doctoris in commendatione\r\naristotelis.” See also Digby 228, 14th century, fol. 27, where a\r\nscribe has written in the upper margin, “In isto libello primo ponitur\r\nprologus, deinde tabula contentorum in libro, deinde prologus cuiusdam\r\ndoctoris in commendacionem Aristotilis, deinde prologus Iohannis qui\r\ntranstulit librum istum....” In Egerton 2676, fol. 6r, “Deus omnipotens\r\ncustodiat regem....”\r\n\r\n[846] Steele (1920), p. xi.\r\n\r\n[847] Steinschneider (1905), p. 42, it is true, says, “Ob Joh. selbst\r\ndas ganze Secretum übersetzt habe, ist noch nicht ermittelt”; but the\r\nfollowing passage, cited by Giacosa (1901), p. 386, from Bibl. Angelica\r\nRome, Cod. 1481, 12th century, fols. 144-146v, indicates that he\r\ntranslated only the medical part.\r\n\r\n“Cum de utilitate corporis olim tractarim et a me quasi essem medicus\r\nvestra nobilitas quereret ut brevem libellum et de observatione diete\r\net de continentia cordis in qualibus se debent contineri qui sanitatem\r\ncorporis cupiunt servare accidit ut dum cogitarem vestre iussioni\r\nobedire huius rei exempliar aristotelis philosophi Alexandro dictum\r\nrepente in mente occurreret quod excerpi de libro qui arabice vocatur\r\nciralacerar id est secretum secretorum que fecit fieri predictus\r\nAristotelis philosophus Alexandro regi magno de dispositione regni in\r\nquo continentur multa regibus utilia....”\r\n\r\nSteele (1920) pp. xvii-xviii, gives the same passage, worded and\r\nspelled a little differently, from another MS, Addit. 26770.\r\n\r\n[848] Ed.

But not much reliance can be\r\nplaced on the inclusion of this name, “Master Philip of Tripoli,” in a\r\ntitle which Brown (p. 20) quotes from a De Rossi MS, “The Book of the\r\nInspections of Urine according to the opinion of the Masters, Peter\r\nof Berenico, Constantine Damascenus, and Julius of Salerno; which was\r\ncomposed by command of the Emperor Frederick, Anno Domini 1212, in\r\nthe month of February, and was revised by Master Philip of Tripoli\r\nand Master Gerard of Cremona at the orders of the King of Spain,”\r\netc., since Gerard of Cremona at least had died in 1187 and there was\r\nno “king of Spain” until 1479. Brown does not give the Latin for the\r\npassage, but if the date 1212 could be regarded as Spanish era and\r\nturned into 1174 A. D., Gerard of Cremona would still be living, the\r\nemperor would be Frederick Barbarossa instead of Frederick II, and\r\nMaster Philip of Tripoli might be the same Philip whom Pope Alexander\r\nIII proposed to send to Prester John in 1177.\r\n\r\nSteele (1920) p. xix, inclines to identify Philip of Tripoli with a\r\ncanon of Byblos from 1243 to 1248, but that seems to me too late a date\r\nfor his translation of _The Secret of Secrets_.\r\n\r\n[852] BN 6584, fol. 1r, “Hunc librum quo carebant latini eo quod\r\napud paucissimos arabies reperitur transtuli cum magno labore....” A\r\nconsiderable portion of Philip’s preface is omitted in the Harvard\r\nedition.\r\n\r\n[853] The preliminary table of contents, however, gives only chapter\r\nheadings, which in BN 6584 are 82 in number, but the beginnings of the\r\nten books are indicated in the text in BN 6584 as follows.

Roger\r\nBacon speaks of the magic books in a grand-sounding style which were\r\nfalsely ascribed to Solomon and which “ought all to be prohibited by\r\nlaw.”[876] Solomon’s reputation as a magician, even in the western\r\nLatin-speaking world, was much older than the thirteenth century,\r\nhowever. In 1918 Roman archaeologists excavated at Ostia a bronze disc,\r\non one side of which was depicted Solomon as a magician, stirring\r\nwith a long ladle some mess in a large cauldron. On the other side of\r\nthe disc was a figure of the triple Hecate, who, like Solomon, was\r\nsurrounded by mystic signs and magic characters.[877]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Magic books ascribed to Solomon.]\r\n\r\nBut to return to the medieval period. In the first half of the\r\nthirteenth century William of Auvergne, bishop of Paris, in his\r\ntreatise on laws declares that there is no divinity in the angles of\r\nSolomon’s pentagon, that the rings of Solomon and the seals of Solomon\r\nand the nine candles (_candariae_) are a form of idolatry, and involve\r\nexecrable consecrations and detestable invocations and images. “As for\r\nthat horrible image called the _Idea Salomonis et entocta_, let it\r\nnever be mentioned among Christians.” In the same class are the book\r\ncalled _Sacratus_ and the figure _Mandel_ or _Amandel_.[878] Some years\r\nlater Albertus Magnus, listing evil books of necromantic images in his\r\n_Speculum astronomiae_,[879] includes five treatises current under the\r\nname of Solomon, and seems to have in mind about the same works as\r\nWilliam. One is _De figura Almandel_, another _De novem candariis_, and\r\na third on the four rings (_De quatuor annulis_) opens with the words\r\n“_De arte eutonica et ideica_,” which remind one of William’s “_Idea\r\nSalomonis et entocta_,” and is perhaps also identical with a _Liber\r\nde umbris idearum_ cited under the name of Solomon by Cecco d’Ascoli\r\nin his necromantic commentary upon the _Sphere_ of Sacrobosco,[880]\r\nwritten in the early fourteenth century.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Manuscripts of them.]\r\n\r\nMoreover, these same works are apparently still extant in manuscripts\r\nin European libraries. The figure Almandal or Almandel and the rings\r\nof Solomon are found in fifteenth century manuscripts at Florence\r\nand Paris,[881] while in the Sloane collection of the British Museum\r\nwe find Solomon’s pentagon, the divine seal, the four rings, and the\r\nnine candles, all in seventeenth century manuscripts.[882] In these\r\nseventeenth century manuscripts also appear, and more than once, the\r\n_Clavicula_ or Key of Solomon, in French, Italian, and English,[883]\r\nthe book by Solomon called _Cephar_ or _Saphar Raziel_,[884] and the\r\n_Liber sacer_ or _sacratus_.[885] The last-named work, mentioned\r\nat least twice in the thirteenth century by William of Auvergne,\r\nwho calls it “a cursed and execrable book,”[886] is also found in\r\nmanuscripts of the fourteenth or fifteenth century,[887] and we shall\r\npresently consider it in particular as a specimen of the Pseudo-Solomon\r\nliterature and of medieval books of magic, theurgy, and necromancy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Notory art of Solomon and Apollonius.]\r\n\r\nLet us first, however, note some other works ascribed to Solomon and\r\nwhich have to do with the _Ars Notoria_, or Notory Art, which seeks\r\nto gain knowledge from or communion with God by invocation of angels,\r\nmystic figures, and magical prayers. We are told that the Creator\r\nrevealed this art through an angel to Solomon one night while he\r\nwas praying, and that by it one can in a short time acquire all the\r\nliberal and mechanical arts.[888] There seems to be little difference\r\nbetween the notory art of Solomon, that of Solomon, Machineus, and\r\nEuclid,[889] and the _Golden Flowers_ of Apollonius,[890] in which\r\nSolomon is mentioned almost every other sentence. Cecco d’Ascoli may\r\nhave had it in mind when he cited the _Book of Magic Art_ of Apollonius\r\nand the _Angelic Faction_ of the same author.[891] In one manuscript\r\nat the close of the _Golden Flowers_ of Apollonius are prayers which\r\none “brother John Monk” confesses he himself has composed in the years\r\n1304-1307.[892] In a later manuscript we find his prayers described as\r\ngiven to him by the blessed God and as “perfect science,” and they are\r\nfollowed by “The Pauline art,” discovered by the Apostle Paul after\r\nhe had been snatched up to the third heaven, and delivered by him at\r\nCorinth.[893] Other works of notory art are listed in the manuscript\r\ncatalogues without name of author.[894] But all alike are apt to\r\nimpress the present reader as unmeaning jumbles of diagrams and magic\r\nwords.[895] We shall sufficiently illustrate them all when we come\r\nto speak of the _Liber sacratus_ which is itself in large measure\r\nconcerned with the Notory Art.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Other works ascribed to Solomon and Apollonius.]\r\n\r\nCertain works may be mentioned which are ascribed to Solomon or to\r\nApollonius in the medieval manuscripts, and which do not seem to be\r\nconcerned with the notory art. Experiments ascribed to Solomon will be\r\nmentioned in another place in connection with experimental literature.\r\nTreatises of alchemy and astrology also were attributed to him.[896]\r\nUnder the name of Apollonius we find a work on the properties or occult\r\nvirtue of things, and another, or possibly the same, on the principal\r\ncauses of things.[897] One wonders if it may have any connection with\r\nthe book on six principles of things ascribed to Hermes Trismegistus\r\nand which has been discussed in our chapter on _Hermetic Books in\r\nthe Middle Ages_. A treatise on palmistry is ascribed to Solomon in\r\na fourteenth century manuscript at Cambridge.[898] A “Philosophy of\r\nSolomon” in a manuscript of the late twelfth century in the British\r\nMuseum consists of “notes perhaps from more than one source on the\r\nanalogy between the patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the three\r\ndivisions of philosophy (_moralis_, _naturalis_, _inspectiva_), and the\r\nthree books of Solomon.”[899]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Liber sacratus_: preface.]\r\n\r\nThe _Liber sacratus_, as William of Auvergne twice entitles it, or\r\nthe _Liber sacer_ or _Liber juratus_, as it is also called in the\r\nmanuscripts,[900] is associated with the name Honorius as well as\r\nSolomon, and is often spoken of as _The Sworn Book of Honorius_.\r\nThe preface, as given in the Latin manuscripts of the fourteenth\r\ncentury--one of which once belonged to Ben Jonson--states that under\r\nthe influence of evil spirits the pope and cardinals had passed\r\na decree aiming at the complete extirpation of the magic art and\r\ncondemning magicians to death. The grounds for this action were that\r\nmagicians and necromancers were injuring everyone, transgressing the\r\nstatutes of holy mother church, making invocations and sacrifices\r\nto demons, and dragging ignorant people down to damnation by their\r\nmarvelous illusions. These charges the magicians hotly deny as inspired\r\nby the envy and cupidity of the devil who wished to keep a monopoly\r\nof such marvels. The magicians declare that it is impossible for a\r\nwicked or impure man to work truly by the magic art, in which they\r\nassert that the spirits are compelled against their will by pure men.\r\nThe magicians further profess to have been forewarned by their art\r\nof this legislation against them. They hesitate, however, to summon\r\nthe demons to their aid lest those spirits avail themselves of the\r\nopportunity to destroy the populace utterly. Instead an assembly of 89\r\nmasters from Naples, Athens, and Toledo has chosen Honorius, son of\r\nEuclid,[901] a master of Thebes, to reduce their magic books to one\r\nvolume containing 93 chapters, which they may more readily conceal\r\nand preserve. And inasmuch as it has pleased the prelates and princes\r\nto order the burning of their books and the destruction of schools of\r\nmagic, the followers of that art have taken an oath not to give this\r\nvolume to anyone until its owner is on his death-bed, never to have\r\nmore than three copies of it made at a time, and never to give it to\r\na woman or to a man who is not of mature years and proved fidelity.\r\nEach new recipient of the sacred volume is also to take this oath.\r\nHence the name, _Juratus_ or _Sworn-Book_. Its other titles, _Sacer_ or\r\n_Sacratus_, refer either to the sacred names of God which constitute\r\nmuch of its text or to its consecration by the angels.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Incipit_ and _Explicit_.]\r\n\r\nAfter this proemium, which, like the magic art itself, is probably more\r\nimpressive than true, the work proper opens with the statement, “In the\r\nname of almighty God and Jesus Christ, one and true God, I, Honorius,\r\nhave thus ordered the works of Solomon in my book.” Later Honorius\r\nreiterates that he is following the precepts and in the foot-prints of\r\nSolomon, whom he also often cites or quotes in course. The _Explicit_\r\nof the _Sworn-Book_ is unusually long and sets forth in grandiloquent\r\nstyle the purpose of the volume.\r\n\r\n“So ends the book of the life of the rational soul,[902] which is\r\nentitled _Liber sacer_ or _The Book of the Angels_ or _Liber juratus_,\r\nwhich Honorius, Master of Thebes, made. This is the book by which\r\none can see God in this life. This is the book by which anyone can\r\nbe saved and led beyond a doubt to life eternal. This is the book by\r\nwhich one can see hell and purgatory without death. This is the book\r\nby which every creature can be subjected except the nine orders of\r\nangels. This is the book by which all science can be learned. This is\r\nthe book by which the weakest substance can overcome and subjugate the\r\nstrongest substances. This is the book which no religion possesses\r\nexcept the Christian, or if it does, does so to no avail. This is the\r\nbook which is a greater joy than any other joy given by God exclusive\r\nof the sacraments. This is the book by which corporeal and visible\r\nnature can converse and reason with the incorporeal and invisible and\r\nbe instructed. This is the book by which countless treasures can be\r\nhad. And by means of it many other things can be done which it would\r\ntake too long to enumerate; therefore it is deservedly called _The Holy\r\nBook_.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A work of theurgy or the notory art.]\r\n\r\nFrom this description it will be seen that the work has a good deal to\r\ndo with the so-called Notory Art. Moreover, in the manuscript copy\r\nsaid to have belonged to Ben Jonson the word _Theurgia_ is written\r\non the fly-leaves before the beginning and after the close of the\r\ntext. This calls to mind the passage in _The City of God_[903] where\r\nAugustine speaks of “incantations and formulae composed by an art\r\nof depraved curiosity which they either call magic or by the more\r\ndetestable name _goetia_ or by the honorable title _theurgia._ For\r\nthey try to distinguish between these arts and condemn some men, whom\r\nthe populace calls _malefici_, as devoted to illicit arts, for these,\r\nthey say, are concerned with _goetia_; but others they want to make out\r\npraiseworthy as being engaged in theurgy. But they are both entangled\r\nin the deceptive rites of demons who masquerade under the names of\r\nangels.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Character of its contents.]\r\n\r\nThe text is full of the names of spirits, prayers in strange words,\r\nsupposedly derived from Hebrew or Chaldaic, and other gibberish.\r\nSeries of letters and figures often occur and names inscribed in\r\nstars, hexagons, and circles. An English translation in a fifteenth\r\ncentury manuscript[904] is adorned with pictures of rows of spirits\r\ndressed like monks in robes and caps but with angelic wings. The text\r\ndoes not seem to be complete in any of the manuscripts that I have\r\nexamined,[905] but Sloane 3854 of the fourteenth century contains an\r\napparently complete table of contents. The chapter headings, anyway,\r\nare more intelligible than the jargon of the text. The first chapter\r\ndeals with the composition of the great name of God which contains 72\r\nletters. The second is about the divine vision and by the time it is\r\nfinished we are nearly two-thirds through the space allotted to the\r\n_Liber juratus_ in one manuscript. The third chapter is on knowledge of\r\nthe divine power, the fourth on absolution from sin, the fifth deals\r\nwith mortal sin, the sixth with the redemption of souls from purgatory.\r\nWith this the “first work” of the collection of Honorius ends. The\r\nopening chapters of the second work discuss the heavens, the angels\r\nfound in each heaven and at the four points of the compass, their names\r\nand powers, seals and virtues, and invocation. Chapters 14 and 15\r\ntell how to get your wish from any angel or to acquire the sciences.\r\nChapter 16 tells how to learn the hour of one’s death, and chapter 17\r\nhow to know all things, past, present, or future. It was perhaps these\r\nchapters that William of Auvergne had in mind when, in censuring works\r\non divination by inspection of mirrors, sword-blades, and human nails\r\nto discover stolen articles and other hidden things, he added that\r\n“from this pest of curiosity proceeded that accursed and execrable\r\nwork called _Liber sacratus_.”[906] That work next returns for three\r\nchapters to the stars and planets and their virtues and influence.\r\nChapter 21 then instructs how to turn day into night or night into\r\nday. Next spirits are further considered, those of air and those of\r\nfire, their names and their superior spirits, their powers, virtues,\r\nand seals. Attention is then given to the four elements and bodies\r\ncomposed thereof, to herbs and plants, and to human nature, after which\r\naquatic and terrestrial spirits are discussed. The future life is then\r\nconsidered and the 33rd chapter, which is the last one of the “second\r\nwork,” deals with “the consecration of this book.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The third “work.”]\r\n\r\nThe “third work,” which extends from chapter 34 to 87 inclusive,\r\ntreats of the control of spirits by words, by seals, by tables, and\r\nby shutting them up. It tells how to provoke thunder and lightning,\r\nstorms, snow, ice, rain, or dew; how to produce flowers and fruit; how\r\nto become invisible; how to wage war and to make an indestructible\r\ncastle, how to destroy a town by means of mirrors; how to sow discord\r\nor concord, how to open closed doors, to catch thieves, fish, and\r\nanimals, and to produce varied apparitions.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The fourth and fifth “works.”]\r\n\r\nThe fourth work deals with similar marvels but it is stated that two of\r\nits chapters, namely, 91 on the apparition of dead bodies which speak\r\nand seem to be resuscitated, and 92 on the apparent creation of animals\r\nfrom earth, will be omitted as contrary to the will of God. The fifth\r\nwork or book, which seems to coincide with the 93rd and last chapter\r\nof Honorius, is in reality divided into five chapters, which return to\r\nthemes similar to those of the first work.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: How to operate with spirits.]\r\n\r\nTo illustrate further the character of the work a few particular\r\npassages may be noticed. We are told that there are three ways of\r\noperating by means of spirits: the pagan, Jewish, and Christian. The\r\npagans sacrificed to spirits of earth and air but did not really\r\nconstrain them. The spirits only pretended to be coerced in order to\r\nencourage such idolatrous practices. “Whoever wishes to operate by such\r\nexperiments” (mark the word!), “deserts the Lord God.” As for the Jews,\r\nthey get along only so-so, and “do in no wise work to obtain the vision\r\nof the deity.” Only a Christian, therefore, can operate successfully\r\nin such visions. “And although three kinds of men work at this art of\r\nmagic, one should not think that there is any evil included in this\r\nname of _magus_, for a _magus per se_ is called a philosopher in Greek,\r\na scribe in Hebrew, and a sage in Latin.”[907]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The seal of the living God.]\r\n\r\nVery elaborate directions are given for the composition of the seal of\r\nthe living God. Circles are drawn of certain proportions emblematic of\r\ndivine mysteries, a cross is made within, numerous letters are written\r\ndown equidistant from one another. A pentagon and two hexagons have to\r\nbe placed just so in relation to one another; characters are inscribed\r\nin their angles; and various sacred names of God, Raphael, Michael, and\r\nother angels are written along their sides. Different parts must be\r\nexecuted in different colors; a particular kind of parchment must be\r\nemployed; and the blood of a mole or hoopoe or bat must be used as ink\r\nfor some of the writing. Finally, there are sacrifices, purifications,\r\nsuffumigations, invocations, and prayers to be performed and offered.\r\nThis seal, we are told, “will conquer the celestial powers, subjugate\r\nthe aerial and terrestrial together with the infernal; invoke,\r\ntransmit, conjure, constrain, excite, gather, disperse, bind, and\r\nrestore unharmed; will placate men and gain petitions from them\r\ngraciously, pacify enemies,”[908] etc., etc.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Spirits of Saturn.]\r\n\r\nThe spirits associated with the planet Saturn are Bohel, Casziel,\r\nUuchathon, and Dacdel. Their nature is to cause sadness and wrath and\r\nhate, to produce ice and snow. Their bodies are long and large, pale\r\nor golden. Their region is in the north and they have five or nine\r\ndemons under them.[909] As a rule spirits of the north and south are\r\nferocious, those of the east and the west gentle.[910]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[876] Brewer (1859), pp. 526, 531.\r\n\r\n[877] _The Nation_, New York, May 10, 1919, p. 744.

There were “established and\r\nfrequented dreaming places” at the shrines of Asclepius at Epidaurus,\r\nAmphiaraus at Oropus, Amphilochus at Mallos, Sarpedon in the Troad,\r\nTrophonius at Lebedea, Mopsus in Cilicia, Hermonia in Macedon, and\r\nPasiphaë in Laconia. We hear of dream-books by Artemon, Antiphon,\r\nStrato, Philochoros, Epicharmus, Serapion, Cratippus, Dionysius\r\nof Rhodes, and Hermippus of Beirut. But the chief work upon the\r\ninterpretation of dreams which has reached us from the time of the\r\nRoman Empire is that of Artemidorus, who was born at Ephesus and lived\r\nin Lydia in the time of the Antonines. He of course wrote in Greek and,\r\ndespite the superstitious character of his work, in a pure and refined\r\nAttic style. The Ὀνειροκριτικά has also been translated into Latin,\r\nFrench, and Italian.[911] It is a compilation in five books gathered\r\nfrom previous literature on the subject and by the author personally\r\nin travel in Greece, Italy, and elsewhere. The first thirteen chapters\r\nof the fourth book, which Artemidorus opens with a general instruction\r\nto his son, deal with such preliminary and general considerations as\r\nthe different types of dreams and more especially those divinely sent,\r\nthe significance of times, the personal qualifications requisite in the\r\ninterpreter, and certain rules of interpretation such as that native\r\ncustoms are good signs and foreign ways bad signs in dreams. But the\r\ngreat bulk of the work consists of specific interpretation arranged\r\neither under topical headings such as “Concerning Nativity,” or listed\r\nas single dreams.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Astrampsychos and Nicephorus.]\r\n\r\nIn the edition of 1603[912] the work of Artemidorus is followed by\r\nmuch briefer metrical treatises on the same subject by Astrampsychos\r\nand Nicephorus.[913] These poems, if they may be so called, devote a\r\nline of interpretation to each of the things seen in dreams, and these\r\nverses are arranged in alphabetical order. This was to be the method\r\nof arrangement adopted in the medieval dream-books ascribed to the\r\nprophet Daniel. Astrampsychos is first named by Diogenes Laertius[914]\r\nin the early third century. He was supposed to have been one of the\r\nPersian Magi, and other occult treatises are ascribed to him, including\r\nastrological writings, a book of oracles addressed to Ptolemy, and love\r\ncharms in a papyrus in the British Museum.[915]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Achmet translated by Leo Tuscus.]\r\n\r\nStill another work on the interpretation of dreams contained in the\r\nedition of 1603[916] is ascribed to “Achmet, the son of Sereim” or\r\nAhmed ben Sirin.[917] The Greek text states that he was interpreter of\r\ndreams to Mamoun, the first minister of the Caliph, which fixes his\r\ndate as about 820 A. D.[918] Perhaps he is the same Achmet who wrote an\r\nastrological treatise extant in Greek which he says he compiled from\r\nbooks from Adam’s time to the present day.[919] Of the work on dreams\r\nthere is a Latin version in the medieval manuscripts translated from\r\nthe Greek by Leo Tuscus,[920] who died in 1182 and was interpreter\r\nof imperial letters in the time of the Byzantine emperor, Manuel\r\nComnenus. Leo prefixes to his translation a prologue addressed[921]\r\nto his brother Hugo Eterianus or Eteriarius (Ecerialius). This work\r\nof Achmet is of about the same length as that of Artemidorus and\r\ncontains over three hundred chapters. It is or pretends to be drawn\r\nmainly from Indian, Persian, and Egyptian sources and often cites\r\nin turn the doctrine or interpretation of those three peoples, or\r\nmentions by name interpreters of dreams of the kings and pharaohs of\r\nthose countries.[922] The preface states that the same dream must be\r\ninterpreted differently in the case of king and commoner, of rich and\r\npoor, and according to sex. The time of the dream must also be taken\r\ninto account. For example, to see a tree blossom is a good sign in\r\nspring but a bad omen in autumn. The hour of the night when the dream\r\noccurs and the phases of the moon are other time factors which must be\r\nreckoned with. The remainder of the treatise is devoted to specific\r\ninterpretation of dreams.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Byzantine and oriental divinations by Daniel.]\r\n\r\nTo Joseph and Daniel, as the chief Biblical interpreters of dreams,\r\nbooks on the subject were assigned in the middle ages, as John of\r\nSalisbury has informed us. Daniel, however, seems to have been the\r\ngreater favorite. Liutprand the Lombard, who died in 972, says in the\r\naccount of his embassy to Constantinople, “The Greeks and Saracens\r\nhave books which they call the _horaseis_, or Visions, of Daniel, but\r\nI should call them Sibylline. In them is found written how many years\r\neach emperor will live, and what will be the character of his reign,\r\nwhether peace or strife, whether favorable or hostile relations with\r\nthe Saracens.”[923] A brief set of Greek verses in alphabetical order\r\nascribed to the emperor Leo, which occur in a late manuscript with\r\nvarious works of the fathers, seem to resemble the Latin alphabetical\r\ndream-books of which we shall presently treat.[924] Works of divination\r\nwere also attributed to Daniel in Syriac and Arabic, such as\r\npredictions of rain, hail, and the like for each day of the year, and\r\nof eclipses and earthquakes,[925] or astrological forecasts for each\r\nmonth of the year.[926] There is even a geomancy in Turkish ascribed to\r\nthe prophet Daniel.[927]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Latin _Dream-Books of Daniel_.]\r\n\r\nDream-Books ascribed to the prophet Daniel are found in Latin\r\nmanuscripts at least as early as the tenth century, and continue\r\nthrough the fifteenth century despite the denial of their authenticity\r\nby John of Salisbury in the twelfth century. At least three different\r\ntypes of _Dream-Books of Daniel_ are represented in incunabula editions\r\nin the British Museum.[928] The _Dream-Book of Joseph_ occurs with\r\nless frequency.[929] These Latin _Dream-Books_ do not go into details\r\nof politics like the Byzantine books which Liutprand described. The\r\nsimplest form, which we have already mentioned in speaking of the\r\nMoon-Books of the tenth and eleventh centuries, is according to the\r\ndays of the moon.[930] It is often embodied in the fuller versions.\r\nTheir usual arrangement is an alphabetical list of objects seen in\r\ndreams with a line of interpretation for each and perhaps a page for\r\neach letter of the alphabet. Sample lines are:\r\n\r\n    _Aerem serenum videre lucrum significat_\r\n    (“To see a clear sky signifies gain”)\r\n    _Intestina sua videre secreta manifesta_\r\n    (“To see one’s own intestines means secrets revealed”)\r\n\r\nThis alphabetical arrangement already appears in the early\r\nmanuscripts.[931] Sometimes, however, the procedure is by opening the\r\nPsalter at random, taking the first letter on the page opened to,\r\nand then referring to a list where the letters of the alphabet have\r\nvarious significations, such as “A signifies power of delight,” “B\r\nsignifies victory in war.”[932] This last method might, of course,\r\nbe employed without having any dream at all, and perhaps should not\r\nbe regarded as a Dream-Book. It is interesting to note that in one\r\nmanuscript it is called _Experiments of Daniel_. In these books\r\nof Daniel further instructions are sometimes given, as when it is\r\nstated that dreams which occur before midnight are of no value for\r\npurposes of interpretation, or when one is told before opening the\r\nPsalter to repeat on bended knees a Lord’s Prayer, _Ave Maria_, and\r\n_Miserere_. Days to be observed are also sometimes mentioned as a sort\r\nof accompaniment to the _Dream-Book_: forty dangerous days “which the\r\nmasters of the Greeks have tested by experiment,”[933] “bromantic days”\r\nfrom the twenty-fourth of November to the eighteenth of December, and\r\n“perentalic days” from the first of January to the first of March.\r\n“And these are the days when the leaves fall from the trees,” which is\r\napparently supposed to have a disturbing effect upon the clarity of\r\ndreams.[934]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Sompniale dilucidarium Pharaonis._]\r\n\r\n_A Sompniale dilucidarium Pharaonis_, as it is entitled in the\r\nmanuscript of it which I have examined,[935] or _Morale somnium\r\nPharaonis_, as it is called in the printed editions,[936] was\r\naddressed by a John of Limoges[937] to Theobald, King of Navarre and\r\nCount of Champagne and Brie, who died in 1216.[938] It is really\r\nnot a Dream-Book but a series of imaginary and fulsomely rhetorical\r\nletters between Pharaoh and his Magi, Pharaoh and Joseph, and Joseph\r\nand adulators and detractors. John states in his introductory letter\r\nto Theobald that the famous dream of Pharaoh will here be “morally\r\nexpounded concerning royal discipline.” Pharaoh typifies any curious\r\nking; Egypt stands for any studious kingdom; Joseph represents any\r\nvirtuous counselor; and the dream will be interpolated with flowers of\r\nrhetoric and theology.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: An anonymous _Exposition of Dreams_.]\r\n\r\nMore elaborate and making more pretense to philosophical character\r\nthan the brief Dream-Books of Daniel is an anonymous work on dreams\r\ncontained in a Paris manuscript of apparently the later part of the\r\nthirteenth century.[939] It is the first treatise in the manuscript,\r\nwhich further contains two important works of the first half of the\r\ntwelfth century, namely, the _Imago mundi_ of Honorius of Autun and the\r\n_De philosophia_ of William of Conches. The texts of these two latter\r\nworks are much cut up and intermixed with each other. It is therefore\r\nnot unlikely that the opening treatise on dreams is also a work of\r\nthe twelfth century, although there does not seem to be much reason\r\nfor ascribing it either to Honorius of Autun or William of Conches. A\r\nlong _prohemium_ fails to throw much light upon the personality of the\r\nauthor, but the work does not seem to be a translation. That it is not\r\nearlier than the twelfth century is indicated by its citation of the\r\n_Viaticum_ and _Passionarius_, presumably the well known medical works\r\nof Constantine Africanus and Gariopontus,[940]--unless indeed it be by\r\nConstantinus himself, to some of whose views it shows a resemblance.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Physiological origin of dreams.]\r\n\r\nThe preface opens by stating that a desirable treasure lies hidden\r\nin the heart of the wise but that it is of no utility unless it is\r\nrevealed. In other words, dreams must be interpreted. The author\r\nregards dreams, like thoughts in general, as beginning with the\r\n_spiritus_ which rises from the heart and ascends through two arteries\r\nto the brain.[941] Our author perhaps still holds to Aristotle’s\r\nview of the importance of the heart in the nervous system as against\r\nGalen’s exclusive emphasis upon the brain, since he allots the heart a\r\nshare even in mental processes; and he seems to be ignorant of Galen’s\r\ndiscovery that the arteries contain blood and not _spiritus_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Origin and justification of the art of interpretation.]\r\n\r\nThe preface goes on to justify the study of dreams on the ground that\r\n“the most ancient Magi and perfect physicians” thereby adjudged to each\r\nman health and sickness, life and death. “Medicine and divine thoughts,\r\ndreams, visions, or oracles are not prohibited, but demoniacal\r\nincantations, sorcery, lot-castings, insomnia, and vain phantasms are\r\ncondemned that you may not readily trust in them.”[942] No doctrine\r\nis to be spurned wholesale, but only what is vicious in it. Shadrach,\r\nMeshach, and Abednego excelled all the Magi and soothsayers of the\r\nChaldeans. Our author explains that among the Chaldeans then as today\r\nlearning consisted not of the philosophy and sophistry of the Greeks\r\nand Latins, but of astronomy and interpretations of dreams. He alludes\r\nto a prayer of seven verses which they repeat when going to bed in\r\norder to receive responses in dreams. They pay little heed to the\r\nsuperficial meaning of their dreams, but by examining the inner meaning\r\nthey learn either past or future. The author exhorts the person to whom\r\nhe addresses the preface to do the same, laying aside all terrors that\r\ndreams may arouse in him. He points out that interpretation of dreams\r\nhas Biblical sanction and that Joseph, Daniel, and Marduch all profited\r\nthereby.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sources of the present treatise.]\r\n\r\nAs for the present treatise, it is collected from divine and human\r\nscripture, based upon experience as well as reason, and drawn from\r\nLatins, Greeks, Persians, and the annals of Pharaoh and Nebuchadnezzar\r\nin which many of their dreams are recorded, for they were both lovers\r\nof the future and, since they had no philosophers like the Gentiles,\r\nGod allowed them as a compensation to foresee the future in dreams.\r\nFor by dreams life and death, poverty and riches, sickness and health,\r\nsorrow and joy, flight and victory, are known more easily than through\r\nastrology, a more difficult and manifold art.[943] But lest his\r\nintroduction grow too long, the author at this point ends it and begins\r\nthe text proper.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Demoniac and natural causes of dreams.]\r\n\r\nAfter stating what a dream is, the author discusses the origin and\r\ncauses of dreams further. Some are from the devil or at least are\r\ninfluenced by demons, as when a monk was led to become a Jew by a\r\ndream in which he saw Moses with a chorus of angels in white, while\r\nChrist was surrounded by men in black. But when we see chimeras in\r\ndreams, this is generally due to impurity of the blood. The author\r\nalso opines that, while the sage can judge from the nature of the\r\ndream whether there is fallacy and illusion of the demon in it, the\r\norigin of virtues and vices is mainly in ourselves. He who goes to\r\nsleep with an easy conscience is unlikely to be disturbed by nightmares\r\nand is more likely in quiet slumber to behold secrets and mysteries.\r\nThe author next discusses the effect of the passions and exercise of\r\nthe mental faculties upon the liver, heart, and brain. He adopts the\r\ncommon medieval view that the brain contains three ventricles devoted\r\nrespectively to imagination, reason, and memory. He explains that the\r\nso-called _incubus_, popularly thought of as a dwarf or satyr who\r\nsits on the sleeper, is really a feeling of suffocation produced by\r\nblood-pressure near the heart. The interpretation of a dream must vary\r\naccording to the social rank of the person concerned. As images in a\r\nmirror deceive the ordinary observer but are readily accounted for\r\nby the geometer, and as the philosopher notes the significations of\r\nother planets than the sun and moon, whose effects alone impress the\r\nvulgar herd, so there are dreams which only a skilled interpreter can\r\nexplain. Dreams are affected by food and by the humors prevailing in\r\nthe body, and also by the occult virtues of gems, of which a list is\r\ngiven from “Evax” or Marbod.[944]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Interpretation.]\r\n\r\nThe second book takes up again the varying significations of dreams\r\naccording to the person concerned, and also the significance of the\r\ntime of the dream. The four seasons, the phases of the moon, nativity\r\nof the dreamer, and hour of the night are discussed. The remaining\r\ntwo-thirds of the treatise consists in stating the interpretation to\r\nbe placed upon the varied persons and things seen in dreams, beginning\r\nwith God and Jesus Christ, and continuing with crucifixes, idols,\r\nstatues, bells, hell, the resurrection of the dead, and so on and\r\nso forth. Early mention of eunuchs and icons suggests a Byzantine\r\nsource. More especially in the last third of the treatise, various\r\nmarginal headings indicate that the interpretations are “according\r\nto the Indians” or “according to the Persians and Egyptians,” which\r\nsuggests that use is being made of the work of Achmet or of Leo Tuscus’\r\ntranslation thereof.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: William of Aragon on prognostication from dreams.]\r\n\r\nThe influence of Achmet’s work is also seen in a treatise on the\r\nprognostication of dreams compiled by master William of Aragon.[945]\r\nIt opens by referring to the labors in this art of the ancient\r\nphilosophers of India, Persia, Egypt, and Greece, and later it cites\r\nSmarchas the Indian,[946] whom I take to be the same as the Strbachan\r\nof Achmet’s second chapter. William justifies writing his treatise\r\nby saying that while there may be many Dream-Books in existence\r\nalready, they are mere _Practice_ and without reason, while he intends\r\nto base the prediction of the future from dreams upon rational\r\nspeculation, and to support his particular reasoning by specific\r\nexamples.[947] He makes more use of Aristotle’s classification of\r\ndreams[948] than the anonymous work just considered, from which he\r\nfurther differs in dwelling more upon the connection of dreams with the\r\nconstellations.[949] The second part of his treatise consists of twelve\r\nchapters devoted to the twelve astrological houses.[950] Earlier he\r\nmentions that at the nativity of Alexander an eagle with extended wings\r\nrested all day on the roof of the palace of his father Philip.[951]\r\nIn stating the signification of various objects William has a chapter\r\non what different parts of the human body signify when seen in\r\ndreams.[952] Like our previous works on divination from dreams, he lays\r\nconsiderable stress upon experience, illustrating his statement that\r\ndreams are often due to bodily ills by cases which “I have seen,”[953]\r\nand also asserting that it is shown by experience that dreams seen on\r\nthe first four days of the week are most quickly fulfilled.[954]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Who was William of Aragon?]\r\n\r\nThis William of Aragon is no doubt the same who commented upon the\r\n_Centiloquium_ ascribed to Ptolemy.[955] From his medical experience\r\nand his tendency to give an astrological explanation for everything one\r\nis tempted to identify him further with the William Anglicus or William\r\nof Marseilles who wrote the treatise of astrological medicine entitled,\r\n_Of Urine Unseen_, in the year 1219, but it is of course unlikely\r\nthat the same man would be called of Aragon as well as of England\r\nand Marseilles or that the words _Anglicus_ and _Aragonia_ should be\r\nconfused by copyists.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: His work formerly ascribed to Arnald of Villanova.]\r\n\r\nThe treatise on dreams has been printed among the works of Arnald\r\nof Villanova,[956] a physician who interpreted dreams for the kings\r\nof Aragon and Sicily at the end of the thirteenth century, under\r\nthe title _Expositio_ (or, _Expositiones_) _visionum quae fiunt in\r\nsomniis_.[957] The _Histoire Littéraire de la France_[958] has noted\r\nthat in the manuscript copies the work was anonymous and not ascribed\r\nto Arnald, but I believe that I am the first to identify it with the\r\nwork of William of Aragon.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Another anonymous work on dreams.]\r\n\r\nIn the same manuscript with the _Sompniale dilucidarium Pharaonis_ and\r\nthe work of William of Aragon on dreams just described is another long\r\nanonymous work on the interpretation of dreams.[959] It makes the usual\r\npoints that the meaning of dreams varies with times and persons. But\r\nthe treatise consists chiefly[960] of a mass of significations which\r\nare not even arranged in alphabetical order, a failing which it is\r\nattempted to remedy by an alphabetical index at the close.[961]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[911] Cockayne, _Anglo-Saxon Leechdoms_, RS vol. 35, 1864-1866, III.\r\nx.

THE THIRTEENTH CENTURY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOREWORD\r\n\r\n\r\nIn our preceding book on the twelfth century we included some writers,\r\nlike Alexander Neckam, who lived on a few years into the following\r\ncentury but whose works were probably written in the twelfth. We now,\r\nwith Michael Scot, begin to treat of authors whose period of literary\r\nproductivity dates after 1200. We shall endeavor to consider the\r\nvarious authors and works in something like chronological order, but\r\nthis is often difficult to determine and in one or two cases we shall\r\npurposely disregard strict chronology in order to bring works of the\r\nsame sort together. Our last four chapters on Arnald of Villanova,\r\nRaymond Lull, Peter of Abano, and Cecco d’Ascoli carry us over the\r\nthreshold of the fourteenth century, the death of the last-named not\r\noccurring until 1327.\r\n\r\nGreater voluminousness and thoroughness mark the work of these writers\r\nas compared with those of the twelfth century. The work of translation\r\nhas been partly accomplished; that of compilation, reconciliation,\r\ncriticism, and further personal investigation and experimentation\r\nproceeds more rapidly and extensively. The new Friar Orders invade the\r\nworld of learning as of everything else: of the writers whose names\r\nhead the following chapters Bartholomew of England and Roger Bacon were\r\nFranciscans;[962] Thomas of Cantimpré, Vincent of Beauvais, Albertus\r\nMagnus, and Thomas Aquinas were Dominicans. In these representatives of\r\nthe new religious Orders, however, theology cannot be said to absorb\r\nattention at the expense of natural science. The prohibitions of the\r\nstudy of the works of Aristotle in the field of natural philosophy by\r\nthe University of Paris early in the century preceded the friars and\r\nwere not lasting, and the mid-century struggle of the friars with the\r\nother teachers at Paris[963] was one over privilege and organization\r\nrather than tenets. Teachers and writers were, however, sometimes\r\ncondemned for their intellectual views at Paris and elsewhere in the\r\nthirteenth century, and whether the study of natural science and\r\nastrology was persecuted is a question which will arise more than once.\r\nIn any case the friars seem to have declined in scientific prowess as\r\nin other respects toward the close of the century. Petrus Hispanus, who\r\nbecame Pope John XXI in 1276-1277, had not been a friar himself, and is\r\nsaid to have been more favorable to men of learning than to the regular\r\nclergy. Finally, in Guido Bonatti, Arnald of Villanova, Peter of Abano,\r\nand Cecco d’Ascoli we come to laymen, physicians and astrologers, who\r\nwere to some extent either anti-clerical themselves or the object of\r\nclerical attack.\r\n\r\nThis was the century in which Roger Bacon launched his famous eulogy of\r\nexperimental science. A good-sized fleet of passages recognizing its\r\nimportance will be found, however, in our other authors, and we shall\r\nneed to devote two chapters to experimental books which were either\r\nanonymous or pretended to date back to ancient or Arabic authors. And\r\nnot without some justification, since we have been tracing the history\r\nof experimental science through our previous books.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[962] Little that is new on the theme of the Franciscans and learning\r\nis contributed by H.

The poet explains\r\nhow astrologers (_mathematici_) “reveal the secrets of things,” by\r\ntheir art affecting numbers, by numbers affecting the procession of\r\nthe stars, and by the stars moving the universe. He recalls having\r\nheard “certain predictions concerning you, O Caesar, from Michael Scot\r\nwho was a scrutinizer of the stars, an augur, a soothsayer, a second\r\nApollo”; and then tells how “the truthful diviner Michael” ceased\r\nto publish his secrets to the world, and “the announcer of fates\r\nsubmitted to fate,” apparently in the midst of some prediction made\r\non his death-bed. Michael’s own statements also show that he was one\r\nof Frederick’s astrologers.[966] If at the time of his death Michael\r\nwas Frederick’s astrologer, it is more questionable at what date his\r\nassociation with Frederick began, and in what countries Michael resided\r\nwith the emperor, or accompanied him to, whether Sicily, southern\r\nItaly, northern Italy, or Germany. From the fact that three of Michael\r\nScot’s works, or rather, the three chief divisions of his longest\r\nextant work,[967] namely, _Liber Introductorius_, _Liber Particularis_,\r\nand _Phisionomia_, were written at the request of Frederick II for\r\nbeginners[968] and apparently in the time of Innocent III,[969] J.\r\nWood Brown jumped to the conclusion that Michael was Frederick’s tutor\r\nbefore that monarch came of age, and that he spent some time in the\r\nisland of Sicily, from which Brown failed to distinguish Frederick’s\r\nlarger kingdom of Sicily.[970] As a matter of fact, there would seem\r\nto be rather more evidence for connecting Michael with Salerno than\r\nwith any Sicilian city, since in one manuscript of his translation\r\nfor the emperor of the work of Avicenna on animals he is spoken of as\r\n“an astronomer of Salerno,”[971] while in another manuscript he is\r\nassociated with a Philip, clerk of the king of Sicily, and this royal\r\nnotary in two deeds of 1200 is called Philip of Salerno.[972] Brown was\r\ninclined to identify him further with Philip of Tripoli, the translator\r\nof the pseudo-Aristotelian _Secret of Secrets_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Some dates in Michael’s career.]\r\n\r\nNo date in Michael’s career before the thirteenth century is fixed. If\r\nit is true that the three sections of his main work were written under\r\nInnocent III, that places them between 1198 and 1216. The date of his\r\ntranslation of the astronomical work of Alpetragius or Alpetrangi (Nûr\r\ned-din el-Betrûgî, Abû Ishâq) seems to have been in the year 1217 on\r\nFriday, August 18, in the third hour and at Toledo.[973] Brown holds\r\nthat Michael translated Avicenna on animals in 1210 for Frederick II\r\nand that the emperor kept it to himself until 1232, when he allowed\r\nHenry of Cologne to copy it.[974] But the date 1210 perhaps applies\r\nonly to a glossary of Arabic terms which accompanies the work and which\r\nis ascribed to a “Master Al.”[975] In a thirteenth century manuscript\r\nat Cambridge Michael Scot’s translation of Aristotle’s _History of\r\nAnimals_ is accompanied by a note which begins, “And I Michael Scot\r\nwho translated this book into Latin swear that in the year 1221 on\r\nWednesday, October twenty-first.”[976] The note and date, however, do\r\nnot refer to the completion of the translation but to a consultation\r\nin which a woman showed him two stones like eggs which came from\r\nanother woman’s womb and of which he gives a painstakingly detailed\r\ndescription. There is, however, something wrong with the date, since in\r\n1221 the twenty-first of October fell on Thursday.[977]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Michael Scot and the papacy.]\r\n\r\nThe career of Michael Scot affords an especially good illustration\r\nof how little likelihood there was of anyone’s being persecuted by\r\nthe medieval church for belief in or practice of astrology. Michael,\r\nalthough subordinating the stars to God and admitting human free will,\r\nas we shall see, both believed in the possibility of astrological\r\nprediction and made such predictions himself. Yet he was a clergyman,\r\nperhaps even a doctor of theology,[978] as well as a court astrologer,\r\nand furthermore was a clergyman of sufficient rank and prominence\r\nto enable Pope Honorius III to procure in 1224 his election to the\r\narchbishopric of Cashel in Ireland.[979] At the same time the papal\r\n_curia_ issued a dispensation permitting Michael to hold a plurality,\r\nso that he evidently already occupied some desirable benefice. Michael\r\ndeclined the archbishopric of Cashel, on the ground that he was\r\nignorant of the native language but perhaps because he preferred a\r\nposition in England; for we find the papacy renewing its efforts in\r\nhis behalf, and Gregory IX on April 28, 1227, again wrote to Stephen\r\nLangton, archbishop of Canterbury, urging him to make provision for\r\n“master Michael Scot,” whom he characterized as “well instructed not\r\nonly in Latin but also in the Hebrew and Arabic languages.”[980]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Prominent position in the world of learning.]\r\n\r\nWhether Michael ever secured the additional foreign benefice or not,\r\nhe seems to have remained in Italy with Frederick until the end of\r\nhis days. He also seems to have continued prominent among men of\r\nlearning, since in 1228 Leonardo of Pisa dedicated to him the revised\r\nand enlarged version of his _Liber abaci_,[981] important in connection\r\nwith the introduction of the Hindu-Arabic numerals into western Europe.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Relation to the introduction of the new Aristotle.]\r\n\r\nRoger Bacon in the _Opus Maius_[982] in a passage often cited by\r\nhistorians of medieval thought ascribes the introduction of the new\r\nAristotle into western Latin Christendom to Michael Scot who, he says,\r\nappeared in 1230 A. D. with portions of the works of Aristotle in\r\nnatural philosophy and metaphysics. Before his time there were only\r\nthe works on logic and a few others translated by Boethius from the\r\nGreek; since 1230 the philosophy of Aristotle “has been magnified\r\namong the Latins.” Although many writers have quoted this statement\r\nas authoritative in one way or another, it must now be regarded as\r\nvaluable only as one more illustration of the loose and misleading\r\ncharacter of most of Roger’s allusions to past learning and to the\r\nwork of previous translators. We know that the books of Aristotle on\r\nnatural philosophy had become so well known by that time that in 1210\r\nthe study of them was forbidden at the university of Paris, and that\r\nabout that same year, according to Rigord’s chronicle of the reign of\r\nPhilip II, the books of Metaphysics of Aristotle were brought from\r\nConstantinople, translated from Greek into Latin, and began to be read\r\nat Paris.[983] But Bacon’s date is more than twenty years too late, and\r\nwe have already mentioned the translation of _The Secret of Secrets_,\r\nwhich Bacon regarded as genuine, the acquaintance of Alexander Neckam\r\nwith works of Aristotle, Alfred of England’s translation of the _De\r\nvegetabilibus_ and of three additional chapters to the _Meteorology_,\r\nthe still earlier translation of the rest of that work by Aristippus\r\nfrom the Greek and by Gerard of Cremona from the Arabic, and Gerard’s\r\nnumerous other translations of works of Aristotle in natural\r\nphilosophy. The translations of Gerard and Aristippus take us back to\r\nthe middle of the twelfth century nearly a century before the date set\r\nby Bacon for the introduction of the new Aristotle.[984] Michael Scot,\r\nthen, did not introduce the works of Aristotle on natural science and\r\nBacon’s chronological recollections are obviously too faulty for us to\r\naccept the date 1230 as of any exact significance in even Michael’s own\r\ncareer, to say nothing of the history of the translation of Aristotle.\r\n\r\nThis is not to say that Michael was not of some importance in that\r\nprocess, since he did translate works of Aristotle and his Arabic\r\ncommentators, especially Avicenna and Averroes. Frederick II is\r\nsometimes said to have ordered the translation from Greek and Arabic\r\nof such works of Aristotle and other philosophers as had not yet\r\nbeen translated from Greek or Arabic.[985] But the letter which has\r\nbeen ascribed in this connection to Frederick is really by his son\r\nand successor, Manfred,[986] for whom many translations were made,\r\nincluding several Aristotelian treatises, genuine and spurious, by\r\nBartholomew of Messina. Already, however, in 1231 and 1232 a Jew at\r\nNaples had translated Averroes’ abridgement of the _Almagest_ and\r\nhis commentary on the _Organon_, in the latter extolling Frederick’s\r\nmunificence and love of science.[987] Michael Scot has been shown to\r\nhave translated from the Arabic the _History of Animals_ and other\r\nworks on animals, making nineteen books in all, and also Avicenna’s\r\ncompendium of the same, the _De caelo et mundo_, the _De anima_ with\r\nthe commentary of Averroes, and perhaps the _Metaphysics_ or part of\r\nit.[988] His translation of the _De caelo et mundo_ was accompanied by\r\na translation of Alpetrangi’s commentary on the same.[989]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Thirteenth century criticism of Michael Scot.]\r\n\r\nScholars of the succeeding generation sometimes spoke unfavorably of\r\nMichael’s work. Although Roger Bacon recognized his translations as the\r\ncentral event in the Latin reception of the Aristotelian philosophy,\r\nand spoke of him as “a notable inquirer into matter, motion, and\r\nthe course of the constellations,”[990] he listed him among those\r\ntranslators who “understood neither sciences nor languages, not even\r\nLatin,” and charged more than once that a Jew named Andrew was really\r\nresponsible for the translations credited to Michael.[991] Albertus\r\nMagnus asserted that Michael Scot “in reality was ignorant concerning\r\nnature and did not understand the books of Aristotle well.”[992] Yet\r\nhe used Michael’s translation of the _Historia Animalium_ as the basis\r\nof his own work on the subject, often following it word for word.[993]\r\nMichael was, however, listed or cited as an authority by the thirteenth\r\ncentury encyclopedists, Thomas of Cantimpré, Bartholomew of England,\r\nVincent of Beauvais, and at the close of that century is frequently\r\ncited by the physician Arnald of Villanova in his _Breviarium\r\npracticae_.[994]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: General estimate of his learning.]\r\n\r\nMichael Scot may be said to manifest some of the failings of the\r\nlearning of his time in a rather excessive degree. His mind, curious,\r\ncredulous, and uncritical, seems to have collected a mass of undigested\r\ninformation and superstition with little regard to consistency or\r\nsystem. Occasionally he includes the most childish and naïve sort of\r\nmaterial, as we shall illustrate later. He continues the Isidorean\r\ntype of etymology, deriving the name of the month of May, for example,\r\neither from the majesty of Jupiter, or from the major chiefs of\r\nRome who in that month were wont to dedicate laws to Jupiter, or\r\nfrom the _maioribus_ in the sense of elders as June is derived from\r\nJuniors.[995] He also well illustrates the puerilities and crudities\r\nof scholastic argumentation. Thus one of the arguments which he lists\r\nagainst regarding a sphere as a solid body is that solids can be\r\nmeasured by a straight line and that it cannot.[996] Asking whether\r\nfire is hot in its own sphere, he says that it might seem not,\r\nbecause fire in its own sphere is light and light is neither hot nor\r\ncold.[997] This argument he rebuts in the end, and he finally decides\r\nthat a sphere is a solid. But he would have seemed wiser to the modern\r\nreader to have omitted these particular contrary arguments entirely.\r\nSuch propositions continue, however, to be set up and knocked down\r\nagain all through the thirteenth century, and such famous men as\r\nThomas Aquinas and Peter of Abano are guilty of much the same sort\r\nof thing. To Michael Scot’s credit may be mentioned his considerable\r\npower of experimentation and of scientific observation. Perhaps some\r\nof the “experiments” attributed to him are spurious, but they show\r\nthe reputation which he had for experimental method, and on the whole\r\nit would seem to be justified. The note in his name in a thirteenth\r\ncentury manuscript at Cambridge,[998] giving a carefully dated and\r\ndetailed account of two human foetuses which had solidified into stones\r\nlike eggs, shows a keen sense of the value of thorough observation\r\nand a precise record of the same. Experimental science would seem to\r\nhave received considerable encouragement at the court of Frederick II,\r\njudging from the stories told of that emperor and the pages of his own\r\nwork on falconry.[999]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: God and the stars.]\r\n\r\nBut let us examine Michael’s views and methods more particularly. In\r\nopening the long preface to his voluminous _Introduction to Astrology_\r\nhe states that hard study is requisite to become a good astrologer,\r\nbut he finds incentive to such effort in citations from Seneca, Cato,\r\nand St. Bernard that it is virtuous to study and to be taught, and\r\nin the reflection that one who knows the conditions and habitudes of\r\nthe superior bodies can easily learn those of inferior bodies. The\r\nsigns and planets are not first movers or first causes, and do not\r\nof themselves confer aught of good or evil, but by their motion do\r\nindicate “something of truth concerning every body produced in this\r\ncorruptible world.” The hour of conception is important and Michael\r\nexplains why two persons born at the same moment may be unlike. He\r\nthen jumbles together from Christian and astrological writers such\r\nassertions as that the stars are only signs, not causes, and that their\r\ninfluence on inferior creation may be compared to the action of the\r\nmagnet upon iron, or that we see on earth good men suffer and bad men\r\nprosper, which has usually been regarded as a better argument for a\r\nfatalistic or mechanical universe than for divine control. He agrees\r\nthat the universe is not eternal and that everything is in God’s power,\r\nbut insists that much can be learned concerning the future from the\r\nstars.[1000]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A theological digression.]\r\n\r\nMichael then embarks upon a long theological digression[1001] in the\r\ncourse of which he quotes much Scripture concerning the two natures,\r\nangelic and human. After telling us of the nine orders of angels in the\r\nempyrean heaven, he deals with the process of creation, just as William\r\nof Conches and Daniel of Morley had done in their works of astronomy\r\nand astrology. In the first three days God created spiritual substances\r\nsuch as the empyrean heaven, angels, stars, and planets; in the other\r\nthree days, visible bodies such as mixtures of the elements, birds,\r\nfish, and man. Michael also answers various questions such as why man\r\nwas created last, although nobler than other creatures, what an angel\r\nis, whether angels have individual names like men, and much concerning\r\nthe tenth part who fell. Perhaps the emperor Frederick is supposed to\r\nput these queries to Michael, but there seemed to be no indication\r\nto that effect in the manuscript which I examined. The reply to the\r\nquestion where God resides is, potentially everywhere but substantially\r\nin the intellectual or empyrean heaven.[1002] Michael discusses the holy\r\nTrinity and thinks that we have a similitude of it in the rational\r\nsoul in the three faculties, intellect, reason, and memory,[1003]\r\nalthough he attempts no association of these with the three Persons\r\nas William of Conches imprudently did in the case of power, wisdom,\r\nand will. He indulges, however, in daring speculation as to where the\r\nmembers of different professions will go after they die. Philosophers,\r\n“who die in the Lord,” will be located in the order of Cherubim, which\r\nis interpreted as plenitude of science; sincere members of religious\r\norders and hermits will become Seraphim; while pope, emperor,\r\ncardinals, and prelates will enter the order of Thrones.[1004] Michael\r\nalso contributes the following acrostic of eight sins whose initials\r\ncompose the word, “Diabolus”:\r\n\r\n  Desperatio\r\n  Invidia\r\n  Avaritia\r\n  Blasphemia\r\n  Odium\r\n  Luxuria\r\n  Ventris ingluvies\r\n  Superbia.[1005]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The three Magi.]\r\n\r\nIn the course of the foregoing digression Michael inserted an account\r\nof the Magi and the star that appears to be based in part but with\r\nvariations on the spurious homily of Chrysostom. He makes them three in\r\nnumber, one from Europe, Asia, and Africa respectively; and states that\r\nforewarned by Balaam’s prophecy they met together annually for worship\r\non the day of Christ’s nativity, which they appear to have known\r\nbeforehand. They stood in adoration for three days continuously on\r\nMount Victorialis until on the third day they saw the star in the form\r\nof a most beautiful boy with a crown on his head. Then they followed\r\nthe star upon dromedaries which, Michael explains, can go farther in\r\na day than horses can in two months. Beside the star three suns arose\r\nthat day at equal distances apart and then united in token of the\r\nTrinity; and Octavianus, emperor of the Romans, saw the Virgin holding\r\nthe Child in the center of the sun’s disk. As for the word _magus_,\r\nMichael explains that it has a threefold meaning,--which, however, has\r\nnothing to do with the Trinity,--namely: trickster, sorcerer, and wise\r\nman, and that the Magi who saw the star were all three of these until\r\ntheir subsequent conversion to Christianity.[1006]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Astrology distinguished from magic.]\r\n\r\nThe remainder of Michael’s lengthy and lumbering preface is largely\r\noccupied with the utility of astrology, which he often calls\r\n“astronomy” (_astronomia_), and differentiation of it from prohibited\r\narts of magic and divination. While, however, he distinguishes these\r\nother occult arts from astrology, he affirms that nigromancers,\r\npractitioners of the notory art, and alchemists owe more to the\r\nstars than they are ready to admit.[1007] He also distinguishes a\r\nsuperstitious variety of astrology (_superstitiosa astronomia_),[1008]\r\nunder which caption he seems to have in mind divination from the\r\nletters of persons’ names and the days of the moon, and other methods\r\nin which the astronomer or astrologer acts like a geomancer or sorcerer\r\nor tries to find out more than God wills. Scot also distinguishes\r\nbetween _mathesis_, or knowledge, and _matesis_, or divination, and\r\nbetween _mathematica_, which may be taught freely and publicly, and\r\n_matematica_, which is forbidden to Christians.[1009]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The magic arts.]\r\n\r\nMichael condemns magic and necromancy but takes evident joy in telling\r\nstories of magicians and necromancers and shows much familiarity with\r\nbooks of magic. He explains “nigromancy” as black art, dealing with\r\ndark things and performed more by night than day, as well as the\r\nraising of the dead to give responses, in which the nigromancer is\r\ndeceived by demons.[1010] He repeats Hugh of St. Victor’s definition\r\nthat the magic art is not received in philosophy, destroys religion,\r\nand corrupts morals. As he has said before, the _magus_ is a trickster\r\nand evil-doer as well as wise in the secrets of nature and in\r\nprediction of the future.[1011] Michael lists twenty-eight varieties\r\nor methods of divination. He believes that they are all true: augury\r\nby song of birds, interpretation of dreams, observance of days, or\r\ndivination by holocausts of blood and corpses. But they are forbidden\r\nas infamous and evil. Later on, in the text itself, he returns to this\r\npoint, saying that these methods of predicting the future are against\r\nthe Christian Faith, but nevertheless true, like the marvels of Simon\r\nMagus.[1012] Michael defines and describes various magic arts in much\r\nthe same manner as Isidore, Hugh of St. Victor, and John of Salisbury;\r\nbut with some divergences. Under aerimancy he includes divination from\r\nthunder, comets, and falling stars, as well as from the shapes assumed\r\nby clouds. Hydromancy he calls “a short art of experimenting” as well\r\nas divining. The gazing into clear, transparent, or liquid surfaces\r\nfor purposes of divination is performed, he says, with some observance\r\nof astrological hours, secrecy, and purity by a child of five or seven\r\nyears who repeats after the master an incantation or invocation of\r\nspirits over human blood or bones. He speaks of a _maleficus_ as one\r\nwho interprets characters, phylacteries, incantations, dreams, and\r\nmakes ligatures of herbs. The _praestigiosus_ deceives men through\r\ndiabolic art by phantastic illusions of transformation, such as\r\nchanging a woman into a dog or bear, making a man appear a wolf or ass,\r\nor causing a human head or limb to resemble that of some animal. Even\r\nalchemy, or perhaps only the superstitious practice of it, Michael\r\nseems to classify as a forbidden magic art, saying, “Alchemy as it were\r\ntranscends the heavens in that it strives by the virtue of spirits to\r\ntransmute common metals into gold and silver and from them to make a\r\nwater of much diversity,” that is, an elixir. Lot-casting, on the other\r\nhand, both the authority of Augustine and many passages in the Bible\r\npronounce licit.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Experiments of magic.]\r\n\r\nMichael more than once ascribes an experimental character to magic\r\narts. Besides calling hydromancy “a short art of experimenting,” he\r\nstates that, since demons are naturally fond of blood and especially\r\nhuman blood, nigromancers or magicians, when they wish to perform\r\nexperiments, often mix water with real blood or use wine which has\r\nbeen exorcized in order to make it appear bloody. “And they make some\r\nsacrifice with the flesh of a living human being, for instance, a\r\nbit of their own flesh, or of a corpse, and not the flesh of brutes,\r\nknowing that consecration of a spirit in a bottle or ring cannot be\r\nachieved except by the performance of many sacrifices.”[1013] Despite\r\nhis censure of the art in the preface under discussion, we find a\r\nnecromantic experiment of an elaborate character ascribed to Michael\r\nScot in a fifteenth century manuscript[1014] which purports to copy it\r\n“from a very ancient book,”[1015] a phrase which scarcely increases\r\nour confidence in the genuineness of the ascription. The object of the\r\nexperiment is to secure the services of a demon to instruct one in\r\nlearning. Times and astrological conditions are to be observed as well\r\nas various other preliminaries and ceremonies; a white dove is to be\r\nbeheaded, its blood collected in a glass vessel, a magic circle drawn\r\nwith its bleeding heart; and various prayers to God, invocations of\r\nspirits, and verses of the Bible are to be repeated. At one juncture,\r\nhowever, one is warned _not_ to make the sign of the cross or one will\r\nbe in great peril.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: History of astronomy.]\r\n\r\nBut to return to Michael’s _magnum opus_. The preface closes with a\r\nrather long and very confused[1016] account of the history of astronomy\r\nand astrology. While Zoroaster of the lineage of Shem was the inventor\r\nof magic, the arts of divination began with Cham, the son of Noah,\r\nwho was both of most subtle genius and trained in the schools of the\r\ndemons. He tested by experience what they taught him and having proved\r\nwhat was true, indited the same on two columns and taught it to his\r\nson Canaan who soon outstripped his father therein and wrote thirty\r\nvolumes on the arts of divination and instructed his son Nemroth in\r\nthe same. When Canaan was slain in war and his books were burned,\r\nNemroth revived the art of astronomy from memory and was, like his\r\nfather, deemed a god by many because of his great lore. He composed a\r\nwork on the subject for his son Ionicon,[1017] whose son Abraham also\r\nbecame an adept in the art and came from Africa to Jerusalem and taught\r\nDemetrius and Alexander of Alexandria, who in turn instructed Ptolemy,\r\nking of Egypt, who invented astronomical canons and tables and the\r\nastrolabe and quadrant. The giant Atlas brought the art to Spain before\r\nMoses received the two tables containing the ten commandments. If this\r\nchronology surprises us, there is something more amazing to follow. At\r\nthis point in the manuscript the copyist has either omitted a great\r\ndeal[1018] or Atlas was extremely long-lived, since we next read\r\nabout his showing the astrolabe to two “clerks of France.” Gilbertus\r\n(presumably Gerbert) borrowed the instrument for a while, conjured up\r\ndemons--for he was the best nigromancer in France, made them explain\r\nits construction, uses, and operation to him, and furthermore all the\r\nrest of astronomy. Later he reformed and had no more dealing with\r\ndemons and became bishop of Ravenna and Pope. Having thus got rather\r\nahead of time, Michael mentions various other learned astronomers,\r\nmost of whom really lived before Gerbert, such as Thebit ben Corat,\r\nMessahalla, Dorotheus, Hermes, Boethius, Averroes, John of Spain,\r\nIsidore, Zahel, and Alcabitius.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The spirits in the sky, air, and earth.]\r\n\r\nHaving finally terminated his preface, Michael begins the first book\r\nwith a description of the heavens and their motion. Some say that the\r\nplanets are moved by angels; others, by winds; but he holds that they\r\nare ruled by divine virtues, spiritual and not corporeal, but of whom\r\nlittle further can be predicated, since they are imperfectly known\r\nto man and naturally will remain so.[1019] Later he states that they\r\ndo not move or rule the celestial bodies naturally but as a service\r\nof obedience to their Creator.[1020] He has already spoken in the\r\npreface of spirits in the northern and southern air, and asserted that\r\nvery wise spirits who give responses when conjured dwell in certain\r\nimages or constellations among the signs of the zodiac.[1021] In the\r\n_Liber particularis_ he speaks of similar demons in the moon.[1022]\r\nNow he mentions “a legion of spirits damned” in the winds.[1023] In\r\nlater passages in the _Liber introductorius_ he gives the names of the\r\nruling spirits of the planets, Kathariel for Saturn,[1024] and so on,\r\nand a list of the names of spirits of great virtue who, if invoked by\r\nname, will respond readily and perform in marvelous wise all that may\r\nbe demanded of them.[1025] And as the planets are said to have seven\r\nrectors who are believed to be the wisest spirits in the sky, so the\r\nseven metals are said to have seven rectors who are believed to be\r\nangels in the earth.[1026] Names of angels also occur in some of his\r\nastrological diagrams.[1027] This education of the reader in details\r\nof astrological necromancy shows that Michael is not to be depended\r\nupon to observe consistently the condemnation of magic and distinction\r\nbetween astrology and necromancy with which he started out in the\r\npreface.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Occult medicine.]\r\n\r\nBy affirming that the physician must know the state of the moon and\r\nof the wind and that “there are many passions of the soul under the\r\nsphere of the moon,”[1028] Michael introduces us to the subject of\r\nastrological medicine, a theme to which he returns more than once in\r\nthe course of the work.[1029] The practice of flebotomy is illustrated\r\nby a figure showing the influence of the signs of the zodiac upon the\r\nhuman body.[1030] From the fact that there are fourteen joints in the\r\nfingers of the hand or toes of the foot Michael infers that man’s\r\nspan of life should be 140 years, a maximum which sin has reduced to\r\n120.[1031] There are as many medicines as there are diseases and these\r\nconsist in the virtues of words, herbs, and stones, as illustrations\r\nof which Michael adduces the sacrament of the altar, the magnet and\r\niron used by deep-sea sailors, and plasters and powders.[1032] In some\r\ncases, however, neither medicine nor astrology seems to avail, and,\r\ndespite his preliminary condemnation of the magic arts, Michael argues\r\nthat when the doctor can do nothing for the patient he should advise\r\nhim to consult an enchantress or diviner.[1033]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The seven regions of the air.]\r\n\r\nFrom the seven planets and sphere of the moon Michael turns to the\r\nseven regions of the air, which are respectively the regions of dew,\r\nsnow, hail, rain, honey, laudanum, and manna.[1034] This is the\r\nearliest occurrence of this discussion which I have met, and I do not\r\nknow from what source, if any, Michael took it. It is essentially\r\nrepeated by Thomas of Cantimpré in his _De natura rerum_, where he\r\ngives no credit to Michael Scot but cites Aristotle’s _Meteorology_\r\nin which, however, only dew, snow, rain, and hail are discussed. In\r\nthe _History of Animals_[1035] Aristotle further states that honey is\r\ndistilled from the air by the action of the stars and that the bees\r\nmake only the wax. Michael similarly describes the honey as falling\r\nfrom the air into flowers and herbs and being collected by the bees;\r\nbut he distinguishes two kinds of honey, the natural variety just\r\ndescribed and the artificial honey which results from the bee’s\r\nprocess of digestion. He also explains that sugar (and molasses?) is\r\nnot a liquor which will evaporate like honey and manna, but is made\r\nfrom the pith of canes.[1036] “Laudanum” is a humor of the air in the\r\nOrient, and manna descends mainly in India with the dew, being found\r\nin Europe only in times of great heat. It is of great virtue, both\r\nmedicinal and in satisfying hunger, as in the case of the children of\r\nIsrael under Moses.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Michael’s miscellaneous content.]\r\n\r\nWe cannot take the time to follow Michael in all his long ramblings\r\nthrough things in heaven above and earth beneath: sun, tides, springs,\r\nseasons, the difference between _stella_, _aster_, _sidus_, _signum_,\r\n_imago_, and _planeta_, the music of the spheres, the octave in music,\r\neight parts of speech in grammar, and eight beatitudes in theology,\r\nzones and paradise, galaxy and horizon and zenith, divisions of time,\r\nthe four inferior elements and the creatures contained in them,\r\neclipses of sun and moon, Adam protoplasm and _minor mundus_ as the\r\nletters of his name indicate, the mutable and transitory nature of this\r\nworld, the inferno in the earth, and purgatory.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Further astrological doctrine.]\r\n\r\nSooner or later Michael comes to or returns to astrological doctrine\r\nand technique, lists the qualities of the seven planets and head and\r\ntail of the dragon,[1037] explains the names and some of the effects\r\nof the signs of the zodiac,[1038] gives weather prognostications\r\nfrom sun and moon,[1039] states the moon’s influence in such matters\r\nas felling trees and slaughtering pigs,[1040] and expounds by text\r\nand figures planetary aspects, exaltations, and conjunctions,[1041]\r\nfriendships and enmities.[1042] The planet Mercury signifies in regard\r\nto the rational soul, grammar, arithmetic, and every science.[1043]\r\nThe election of hours is considered and a list given of what to do and\r\nnot to do in the hour of each planet and that of the moon in each\r\nsign.[1044] There then follows, despite Michael’s animadversions in\r\nthe preface against interpreters of dreams and those observing days,\r\nan “Exposition of dreams for each day of the moon,”[1045] nativities\r\nfor each day of the week, and a method of divination from the day of\r\nthe week on which the New Year falls.[1046] A discussion of the effect\r\nof the moon upon conception is interrupted by a digression on eggs:\r\nhow to estimate the laying power of a hen by the color and size of\r\nits crest, the effect of thunder upon eggs, how from eggs to make a\r\nwater of great value in alchemy, and how to purify bad wine with the\r\nwhite of an egg.[1047] Returning again to the moon, we are told that\r\nin the new moon intellects are livelier, scholars study and professors\r\nteach better, and all artisans work harder. Michael Scot used to say\r\nto the emperor Frederick that if he wished clear counsel from a wise\r\nman, he should consult him in a waxing moon and in a human and fiery\r\nor aerial sign of the zodiac.[1048] Michael had spoken earlier of the\r\nplanets as judges of the varied questions of litigators,[1049] and\r\nnow, although admitting the freedom of the human will, he proceeds\r\nto discuss at considerable length[1050] the art of interrogations\r\nby which the astrologer answers questions put to him. With this the\r\nBodleian manuscript of the _Liber introductorius_ ends, apparently\r\nincomplete.[1051]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Omission of nativities.]\r\n\r\nIn the marginal gloss accompanying a Latin translation of the\r\nastrological works of Abraham Avenezra in a manuscript of the fifteenth\r\ncentury[1052] Michael Scot is quoted a good deal on the subject of\r\nnativities. But the _Liber introductorius_, or at least as much of it\r\nas appears in the Bodleian manuscript, contains little upon this side\r\nof astrology, except the brief nativities for each day of the week.\r\nA passage quoted by Brown[1053] to the effect that the person born\r\nunder a certain sign will be an adept in experiments and incantations,\r\nin coercing spirits and working marvels, and will be an alchemist and\r\nnigromancer, appears in the manuscript as a marginal addition rather\r\nthan part of the text and so is presumably not by Michael Scot himself.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Magic for every hour.]\r\n\r\nIn connection with the subject of elections Michael gives a list of the\r\nprayers, conjurations, and images appropriate for each of the twelve\r\nhours of the day and of the night.[1054] For instance, in the first\r\nhour of the day men pray to God and it is a good time to bind all\r\ntongues by images, characters, and conjurations. In the second hour\r\nangels pray to God and images and other devices to promote love and\r\nconcord should be constructed then. In the third hour birds and fishes\r\npray to God and it is a good time to make images and other contrivances\r\nto catch birds and fish. In the first hour of the night demons hold\r\ncolloquy with their lord and the time is favorable for the invocation\r\nof spirits.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Quaint religious science.]\r\n\r\nA more Christian and less magical enumeration of the hours occurs in\r\nthe _Liber particularis_.[1055] At morning Christ was arrested on the\r\nMount of Olives. In the first hour Christ was presented to Ananias and\r\nCaiaphas, the high priests; in the third hour, to Pontius Pilate; in\r\nthe sixth hour He was brought back to Herod and taken to Mount Calvary;\r\nin the ninth He was given vinegar and gave up the ghost and the earth\r\nquaked and the veil of the temple was rent in twain; at vespers He was\r\ntaken down from the cross. Another specimen of this quaint religious\r\nscience is found in the _Liber introductorius_,[1056] where Michael,\r\nwriting before the invention of the telescope, speaks of the limits\r\nset to seeing into the heavens except by special grace of God, as in\r\nthe case of Katherine and of Stephen, the first martyr, who, when\r\nstoned, saw the heavens opened. A third example occurs in the third\r\npart of the _opus magnum_, or _Phisionomia_, where it is stated that\r\nat birth a male child cries “Oa” and a female child “Oe,” as if to say\r\nrespectively, “O Adam (or, O Eve) why have you sinned that I on your\r\naccount must suffer infinite misery?”[1057] In the same work Michael\r\ngives original sin as one of two reasons why a baby cannot talk and\r\nwalk as soon as it is born.[1058]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The _Phisionomia_.]\r\n\r\nThe third part of Scot’s main work, and the only section which has\r\nbeen printed, is that primarily devoted to the pseudo-science of\r\nphysiognomy, which endeavors to determine a man’s character from signs\r\nfurnished by the various parts of his body. The _Phisionomia_[1059]\r\nis addressed to the Emperor Frederick II who is exhorted to the\r\npursuit of learning in general and the science of physiognomy in\r\nparticular. This is probably a conscious or unconscious imitation of\r\nthe remarks addressed to Alexander by the Pseudo-Aristotle in _The\r\nSecret of Secrets_, of which also a considerable portion is devoted\r\nto physiognomy, and from which Rasis and Michael borrowed a good\r\ndeal.[1060] Indeed, the _Phisionomia_ of Michael Scot is also often\r\nentitled _De secretis naturae_ and really only a certain portion of it\r\nis devoted exclusively to physiognomy proper. Its early chapters and\r\nfirst part deal rather with the process of generation and it is only\r\nwith the twenty-third chapter and second part that Michael “reverts to\r\nthe doctrine of physiognomy.” Perhaps these chapters on generation had\r\nmore to do with the popularity and frequent printing of the work than\r\ndid those on physiognomy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Influence of the stars on human generation.]\r\n\r\nIn this discussion of the process of human generation the influence\r\nof the stars receives ample recognition. Michael regards the moment\r\nof conception as of great astrological importance; then according to\r\nthe course of the stars and the disposition of the bodies conceiving\r\nthe foetus receives “similarly and simultaneously” each and all of\r\nthe determining factors in its subsequent nature and history.[1061]\r\nThis we may perhaps regard as a medieval approach to the theory of\r\nMendel. Michael further urges every woman to note the exact moment\r\nof sexual intercourse, when this is to result in generation, and so\r\nmake astrological judgment easy.[1062] Yet he states later that God\r\ngives a new and free soul with the new body, just as a father might\r\ngive his son a new tablet on which to write whatever he wills of good\r\nor evil.[1063] He notes the correspondence of the menstrual fluid to\r\nthe waxing and waning of the moon and that planet’s influence during\r\nthe seventh month of the formation of the child in the womb,[1064]\r\nand gives the usual account of the babe’s chances of life or death\r\naccording as it is born within seven months, or during the eighth, or\r\nninth, or tenth month. It is not quite clear if it is because there\r\nare seven planets that Michael affirms that a woman can bear as many\r\nas seven children at once.[1065] He adds that in this case the child\r\nconceived in the middle one of the seven cells of the matrix will be a\r\nhermaphrodite.[1066]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Discussion of divination.]\r\n\r\nScot’s treatise on Physiognomy has considerable to say of other forms\r\nof divination and they here appear in a more favorable light than in\r\nhis discussion of varieties of the magic arts in the preface preceding\r\nhis _Liber introductorius_. Among signs to tell whether a pregnant\r\nwoman will give birth to a boy or a girl he suggests “a chiromantic\r\nexperiment”[1067] which consists simply in asking her to hold out her\r\nhand. If she extends the right, the child will be a boy; if the left,\r\na girl. He also expounds methods of augury at some length, although\r\nagain stating that they are in the canons of the church, that is to say\r\nprohibited by canon law. The divisions of space employed in augury are\r\ntwelve in number after the fashion of the signs of the zodiac.[1068]\r\nMichael also discusses the significance of sneezes. If anyone sneezes\r\ntwice or four times while engaged in some business and immediately\r\nrises and moves about, he will prosper in his undertaking. If one\r\nsneezes twice in the course of the night for three successive nights,\r\nit is a sign of death or some catastrophe in the house. If after making\r\na contract one sneezes once, it is a sign that the agreement will\r\nbe kept inviolate; but if one sneezes thrice, the pact will not be\r\nobserved.[1069]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Divination from dreams.]\r\n\r\nDreams and their interpretation are also discussed in the\r\n_Physionomia_.[1070] The age of the dreamer, the phase of the moon,\r\nand the stage reached in the process of digestion, all have their\r\nbearing upon interpretation. A dream which occurs before the process of\r\ndigestion has started either has no significance or concerns the past.\r\nThe dream which comes while the food is being digested has to do with\r\nthe present. Only when the process of digestion has been completed do\r\ndreams occur which signify concerning the future. In order to recall a\r\ndream in the morning Michael recommends sleeping upon one’s other side\r\nfor the remainder of the night or rubbing the back of the head the next\r\nday. Some dreams signify gain, others loss; some joy, others sadness;\r\nsome sickness, others health, others war; some labor, others rest. For\r\ninstance, to catch a bird signifies gain, to lose a bird in one’s dream\r\nsignifies loss; to mourn in dreams portends joy, to laugh indicates\r\ngrief. The rest of his discussion of dreams Scot limits to their\r\nsignificance in matters of health and physical constitution. He takes\r\nup dreams indicative of predominance of blood, red cholera, phlegm,\r\nand melancholy respectively; of heat, cold, dryness, and humidity; of\r\nexcess of humors and of bad humors.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Works of divination ascribed to Michael Scot.]\r\n\r\nWhile on the subject of divination we may note that a geomancy[1071]\r\nand a chiromancy[1072] have been ascribed to Michael Scot, and also\r\nprophetic verses concerning the fate of Italian cities in the style\r\nof the Sibylline verses and prophecies of Merlin. Brown held that the\r\nevidence for the authenticity of these verses was as convincing as that\r\nfor any event in Scot’s life.[1073]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Medical writings.]\r\n\r\nIt would not be surprising to find that Michael himself practiced\r\nmedicine as well as astrology, in view of the attention given to human\r\nphysiology and the process of generation in his _Physiognomy_ and\r\nelsewhere, and the interest in biology which his translation of the\r\nAristotelian works on animals evidences. A treatise on prognostication\r\nfrom the urine is ascribed to him[1074] and “Pills of Master Michael\r\nScot” are mentioned in at least one manuscript,[1075] where they are\r\ndeclared to be good for all diseases and of virtue indescribable.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Occult virtues.]\r\n\r\nMichael’s general allusion to the occult virtue of words, herbs, and\r\nstones in the _Liber introductorius_ may be supplemented by a few\r\nspecific examples of the same from the other two divisions of his\r\nmain work. In the _Liber particularis_ he mentions such virtues of\r\nstones as the property of the agate to reveal various signs of demons\r\nand illusions of enchantment, and the power of the jasper to render\r\nits bearer rich, amiable, and eloquent.[1076] In the _Phisionomia_\r\nhe suggests that persons who cannot maintain physical health without\r\nfrequent sexual intercourse may be able to do so by carrying a jasper\r\nor topaz.[1077] He also states that bathing in the blood of a dog\r\nor of two-year-old infants mixed with hot water “undoubtedly cures\r\nleprosy,”[1078] and that many sorceries can be wrought by use of the\r\nmenstrual fluid, _semen_, hairs of the head, blood, and footprints in\r\ndust or mud.[1079]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Astrology in the _Commentary on the Sphere_.]\r\n\r\nMichael Scot’s _Commentary upon the Sphere of Sacrobosco_[1080]\r\nconfines itself rather more strictly to astronomical and astrological\r\ntopics than did the _Liber introductorius_, but otherwise their\r\ncontents are not dissimilar. In the Commentary Michael discusses such\r\nquestions as whether the universe is eternal, one or many, and what\r\nform or figure it should have; whether the mover of the sky is moved,\r\nwhether the stars are spherical bodies, and whether the zone between\r\nthe tropic of Capricorn and the Antarctic Circle is temperate and\r\ninhabited. Also whether the elements are four in number, and whether\r\nthe heavens include a ninth sphere. One argument against its existence\r\nis that there are no stars in it, on which account some hold that it\r\nwould exert no influence upon the earth. But Michael replies that it\r\nhas light apart from any starry bodies and by virtue of this light\r\ndoes exert influence. Other astrological questions which he raises\r\nare whether the signs of the zodiac should be designated by the\r\nnames of animals, whether the first heaven is a more potent cause of\r\ngeneration and corruption than the circle of the zodiac is, whether\r\ncelestial bodies have particular properties as terrestrial bodies do,\r\nwhether the heavens are animate, whether their motion is natural or\r\nvoluntary, whether the motion of the planets is rational, and whether\r\nsupercelestial bodies act upon inferiors by virtue of their motion.\r\nIn mentioning the departments of life over which the seven planets\r\nrule, Michael cites either theologians or astrologers[1081] to the\r\neffect that Saturn signifies concerning pagans, Jews, and all other\r\nadversaries of the Faith, who are slow to believe just as Saturn is\r\nslow of movement and chilling in effect, while Jupiter is the sign of\r\ntrue believers and Christians.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Dionysius the Areopagite and the solar eclipse during\r\nChrist’s passion.]\r\n\r\nIn commenting upon Sacrobosco’s concluding passage concerning the\r\nmiraculous eclipse at the time of Christ’s passion and the remark\r\nattributed to Dionysius the Areopagite, “Either the God of nature\r\nsuffers or the machine of the universe is dissolved,” Michael explains\r\nthat ancient Athens was divided into three parts. One of these was the\r\nshore which was consecrated to Neptune, but in place of the plain and\r\nthe mountains, Michael appears to take a leaf out of Plato’s _Republic_\r\nand mentions the region of the warriors, dedicated to Pallas, goddess\r\nof war, and the residential quarter of the philosophers, named the\r\nAreopagus from Ares meaning virtue and _pagus_ meaning villa. According\r\nto Michael the altar to the unknown god was erected by Dionysius the\r\nAreopagite at the time of the darkness and earthquake accompanying\r\nChrist’s passion, and when Paul came and preached the Christ whom he\r\nignorantly worshiped, Dionysius was converted, and became a missionary\r\nto the Gauls, bishop of Paris, and finally gained a martyr’s crown.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Alchemy.]\r\n\r\nIn the _Liber Introductorius_ Michael seemed to associate alchemy\r\nwith the magic arts. In his _Commentary on the Sphere_ his attitude\r\nis more favorable. After citing the fourth book of the _Meteorology_\r\nand other passages from Aristotle to the effect that no element can be\r\ncorrupted and hence the transmutation striven after by the alchemists\r\nis impossible, Michael explains that the word element may be taken\r\nin two senses. As a part of the universe it is neither generable nor\r\ncorruptible, but in so far as an element is mixed with active and\r\npassive qualities, it is both generable and corruptible.[1082]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Works of alchemy ascribed to Michael Scot.]\r\n\r\nThanks perhaps to this passage the composition or translation of\r\nseveral works of alchemy is ascribed to Michael Scot in manuscripts\r\nor printed editions. The _Quaestio curiosa de natura Solis et Lunae_,\r\nwhich was printed as Michael’s in two editions of the _Theatrum\r\nChemicum_,[1083] was apparently written after his death.[1084] A\r\nPalermo manuscript contains among other alchemical tracts a “Book of\r\nMaster Michael Scot in which is contained the mastery.”[1085] In at\r\nleast one manuscript Michael Scot is called the translator of the\r\n_Liber luminis luminum_, of which Rasis is elsewhere mentioned as the\r\noriginal author.[1086] In an Oxford manuscript a _De alchemia_ is\r\nattributed to Michael Scot. It is addressed to “you, great Theophilus,\r\nking of the Saracens”[1087] rather than to the Emperor Frederick, and\r\nspeaks of “the noble science” of alchemy as “almost entirely rejected\r\namong the Latins.” Michael Scot mentions himself by name in it rather\r\ntoo often for us to accept the treatise as his without question, while\r\nthe allusions to “Brother Elias” the Franciscan as a fellow-worker in\r\nalchemy are perhaps also open to suspicion.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Brother Elias and alchemy.]\r\n\r\nWe find, however, another suggestion of Brother Elias’s interest in\r\nalchemy and association therein with Michael Scot in the fact that in\r\nthe same manuscript containing the translation of the _Liber luminis\r\nluminum_ ascribed to Michael occurs another _Liber lumen luminum_ which\r\nBrother Elias, General of the Friars Minor, edited in Latin for the\r\nEmperor Frederick.[1088] A brother Cyprian translated it from Arabic\r\ninto Latin for him. In view of the later interest of another Franciscan\r\nfriar, Roger Bacon, in alchemy and the supposition which some have\r\nentertained that he was persecuted by his Order because of his\r\nexperimental studies, this reputation of Brother Elias as an alchemist\r\nis interesting to note. One of St. Francis’s earliest followers, he\r\nsucceeded him in 1226 as General of the Order. Deposed by the pope in\r\n1230 on the charge of promoting schism in the Order, he was re-elected\r\nin 1236 and was again deposed by the pope in 1239, after which he\r\njoined the imperial party and was excommunicated from 1244 until just\r\nbefore his death in 1253.[1089] Brown suggested that his alchemical\r\nactivities were alluded to by the pope on the occasion of his first\r\ndeposition in the words “_mutari color optimus auri ex quo caput erat\r\ncompactum_.”[1090] But if Elias was an alchemist, no open objection to\r\nthis appears to have been made either by the pope or his Order. Indeed,\r\nmany of the alchemists in Italy of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries\r\nwere clergy and even friars.[1091]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Liber luminis luminum_ and _De alchemia_.]\r\n\r\nBrown has already discussed the contents of the _Liber luminis luminum_\r\nand _De alchemia_ (or, _alchimia_)[1092] but erroneously and from not\r\nquite the same standpoint as ours. He incorrectly interprets “the\r\nsecrets of nature” which the writer says he has investigated as the\r\ntitle of a book which has formed his chief source.[1093] Brown also\r\nstates that one of several features which distinguishes the _De\r\nalchemia_ from the _Liber luminis_ “is an early passage which refers\r\nto the correspondence between the metals and the planets.”[1094] But\r\nthere is a similar passage connecting seven metals with the seven\r\nplanets in the opening paragraph of his own printed text of the _Liber\r\nluminis luminum_.[1095] The latter treatise, brief as it is, divides\r\ninto five parts dealing with salts, alums, vitriols, spirits, and the\r\npreparation of alums, and the employment of these in transmutation. The\r\n_De alchemia_ is less orderly in arrangement and seems largely a brief\r\ncollection of particular recipes for transmutation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Their further characteristics.]\r\n\r\nBoth works emphasize the secret character of alchemy. The _De alchemia_\r\nholds forth concerning the great secret of Hermes and Ptolemy, and\r\ntells how most men’s eyes are blinded, and to how few the truth of the\r\nart is revealed. The _Liber luminis luminum_ narrates that “when the\r\ngreat philosopher was dying he said to his son, ‘O my son, hold thy\r\nsecret in thy heart, nor tell it to anyone, nor to thy son, unless\r\nwhen thou canst retain it no longer.’ Wise philosophers have yearned\r\nwith yearning to know the truth of this salt. But few have known it\r\nand those who have known it have not told in their books the truth\r\nconcerning it as they saw it.”[1096] Both works also are largely\r\nexperimental in form and in the _De alchemia_ we are assured more than\r\nonce that “I, Michael Scot, have experienced this many times.”[1097]\r\nThe books of the ancients and past philosophers are cited both in\r\ngeneral and by name, but a black vitriol from France called French\r\nearth[1098] and a gum found in Calabria and at Montpellier[1099] are\r\nmentioned as well as herbs and minerals from India and Alexandria, and\r\nwe also hear of the experiments of brother Elias, certain Saracens who\r\nseem of comparatively recent date, and of the operation at Catania\r\nor Cortona by master Jacob the Jew which “I afterwards proved many\r\ntimes.”[1100] The _Liber luminis luminum_ often speaks of “the great\r\nvirtue” of this or that, and both treatises make much use of animal\r\nsubstances such as “dust of moles,” the urine of the _taxo_ or of a\r\nboy, the blood of a ruddy man or of an owl or frog. Five toads are\r\nshut up in a vessel and made to drink the juices of various herbs with\r\nvinegar as the first step in the preparation of a marvelous powder for\r\npurposes of transmutation.[1101]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[964] James Wood Brown, _An inquiry into the life and legend of Michael\r\nScot_, Edinburgh, 1897.

Concerning Philip see also Brown, pp.\r\n19, 36-7. The important passage in the MS is, “Explicit nicromantiae\r\nexperimentum illustrissimi doctoris Domini Magistri Michaelis Scoti,\r\nqui summus inter alios nominatur Magister, qui fuit Scotus, et servus\r\npraeclarissimo Domino Philipo Regis Ceciliae coronato; quod destinavit\r\nsibi dum esset aegrotus in civitate Cordubae, etc. Finis.” Brown, p.\r\n19, translates the last clause, “which experiment he (i. e., Michael)\r\ncontrived when he lay sick in the city of Cordova,” and so concludes\r\nthat Scot visited that city; but I should translate it, “which he\r\n(Michael) sent to him (Philip) while he (Philip) lay sick in the city\r\nof Cordova.” Otherwise why is Philip mentioned at all?\r\n\r\n[973] Brown, p. 104, citing Jourdain, _Recherches_, p. 133, who called\r\nattention to two Paris MSS, Anciens fonds 7399 and Fonds de Sorbonne\r\n1820, in one of which the MS is dated 1217, while the other gives the\r\nyear as 1255 which is the exactly corresponding year of the Spanish\r\nera. Arsenal 1035, 14th century, fol. 112, a MS not noted by Jourdain\r\nor Brown, states the year as 1207 A. D., but this is evidently a\r\nmistake for 1217, since it gives the same day of the week and month as\r\nthe other MSS and August 18th fell on Friday in 1217, but not in 1207.\r\nBN 16654, 13th century, fol. 33, gives the date as 1217.\r\n\r\n[974] P. 55, arguing from a Vatican MS which is described at pp. 235-7.\r\n\r\n[975] “Glosa magistri al.

Haskins notes various mentions of Nimrod as an\r\nastronomer in medieval authors, but not the above passage from Michael\r\nScot. Although Latin writers make Ioathon or Ionaton (and various other\r\nspellings) the disciple of Nimrod, in Syrian writers Ionitus is the\r\nfourth son of Noah and himself the discoverer of astronomy and teacher\r\nof Nimrod (Haskins, _op. cit._ 210-11).\r\n\r\n[1018] The word _Explicit_ is written across the knees of a figure of\r\nthe giant Athalax or Caclon who supports the heavens on his head at\r\nfol. 25r, col. 1, but the passage concerning “Gilbertus” follows and\r\nthe proper Explicit of the preface does not occur until fol. 25v, col.\r\n1.

The lines quoted in DNB “John Holywood or Halifax” as on his\r\ntomb in the cloister of the Mathurins and as having reference to the\r\ndate of his death are really the verses at the close of his _Computus\r\necclesiasticus_:\r\n\r\n“_M Christi bis C quarto deno quater anno_ _De Sacro Bosco discrevit\r\ntempora ramus_ _Gratia cui dederat nomen divina Johannes_,” etc.\r\n\r\nCantor II (1913), p. 87, however, speaks of two different tomb\r\ninscriptions given by Vossius and Kästner but says that they agree on\r\n1256 as the date of Sacrobosco’s death.

Finally,\r\nhe also gives considerable information concerning what we may call\r\nthe school of natural magic and of experiment. This theologian is\r\nWilliam of Auvergne, bishop of Paris from 1228 to his death in 1249,\r\nand previously a canon of that city and a master of theology in its\r\nuniversity. Judging from his age when he received this degree Valois\r\nestimates that he was born about 1180. He was made a bishop at Rome by\r\nthe pope, where he had come as a simple deacon to pursue his appeal in\r\nthe recent disputed election.[1103] He granted the Dominicans their\r\nfirst chair of theology at Paris during a quarrel of the university in\r\n1228 with Queen Blanche of Castile and the dispersion of the faculties\r\nto Angers and Rheims.[1104] He took a prominent part in the Parisian\r\nattack upon the Talmud and was perhaps the first Christian doctor of\r\nthe Latin west to display an intimate acquaintance with the works\r\nattributed to Hermes Trismegistus.[1105] These facts suggest the extent\r\nof his reading in occult lore. We shall consider his views as expressed\r\nin his various writings, “On Sins and Vices,” “Of Laws” (or Religions),\r\nin the frequent medieval use of the word, _lex_, “Of Morals,” “Of\r\nFaith,” but especially in his voluminous work on “The Universe” which\r\ndeals more with the world of nature than do his other theological\r\ntreatises. Indeed, in the sixteenth century edition of his works he is\r\ncalled “a most perfect mathematician” and “a distinguished philosopher”\r\nas well as “a most eminent theologian.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: His respect for science.]\r\n\r\nWilliam at any rate has respect for natural philosophy and favors\r\nscientific investigation of nature. Like his namesake of Conches in\r\nthe preceding century he has no sympathy with those who, when they\r\nare ignorant of the causes of natural phenomena and have no idea how\r\nto investigate them, have recourse to the Creator’s omnipotent virtue\r\nand call everything of this sort a miracle, or evade the necessity of\r\nany natural explanation by affirming that God’s will is the sole cause\r\nof it. This seems to William an intolerable error, in the first place\r\nbecause they have thus only one answer for all questions, and secondly\r\nbecause they are satisfied with the most remote cause instead of the\r\nmost immediate one. There is no excuse for thus neglecting so many\r\nvaried and noble sciences.[1106]\r\n\r\nIn another passage William apologizes to the person to whom the _De\r\nuniverso_ is addressed for the summary and inadequate discussion of\r\nthe stars in which he has just been indulging.[1107] He knows that\r\ncertitude in this subject calls for a most thorough investigation and\r\nrequires a separate treatise. Moreover, his remarks have been in the\r\nnature of a digression and have little direct bearing on the question\r\nunder discussion. But he has introduced them in order that his reader\r\nmight see something of the depth and truth of philosophical discussion\r\nand not think that it can be despised as some fools do, who will accept\r\nnothing unless it is armed with proofs and adorned with flowers of\r\nrhetoric and who still more insanely regard as erroneous whatever they\r\ndo not understand.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: And for experimentation.]\r\n\r\nThus we see the scientific standards of William of Conches in the\r\ntwelfth century still influential and probably more universally\r\nprevalent in the thirteenth. Like his namesake of Conches again,\r\nWilliam of Auvergne states that our common fire is not the pure\r\nelement, since it is largely made up of burning coal or wood or other\r\nconsumed objects.[1108] He also states that “innumerable experiences”\r\nhave proven that moles do not live on earth but hunt worms in\r\nit.[1109] William is aware that many sailors and navigators have found\r\nby experience that certain seas open into others, and as another\r\nindication that all seas are really only one connected sea, he adduces\r\nhidden subterranean channels, and mentions the report that Sicily is\r\nsupported on four or five mountains as if by so many columns. Such\r\nare some illustrations of the bits of scientific information and the\r\ntrust in natural experiment to be found in William’s work. It is indeed\r\nsurprising the number of times he alludes to “experimenters” and to\r\n“books of experiments.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Influenced by Christian doctrine.]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand William, of course, maintains such doctrines as\r\nthat of creation against the Peripatetic theory of the eternity of\r\nthe universe. He also does not confuse the world soul with the Holy\r\nSpirit as William of Conches and Theodoric of Chartres had done.[1110]\r\nMore important than these particular points is the general hypothesis\r\nrunning through and underlying much of William’s thought that the\r\nCreator can interfere again in the course of nature at any time and\r\nin any way He wills.[1111] The atmosphere of the miraculous and the\r\nspiritual is almost constantly felt in William’s account of the\r\nuniverse. To a certain extent, however, he evades the difficulties\r\nbetween science and religion by holding that one thing is true in\r\nphilosophy and quite another in theology. Thus he affirms that one\r\nwho says that the stars and lights of the sky do not receive addition\r\nor improvement, speaks the truth if the matter is regarded from the\r\nstandpoint of natural science, for nature cannot add anything to their\r\nnatural perfection. “Yet you ought to know that learned Christian\r\ndoctors teach ... and the prophets seem to say expressly that they will\r\nundergo improvement.”[1112] It is, then, as we said to begin with, the\r\naccount of magic, demons, occult virtue, divination, astrology and\r\nexperimental science, of a theologian not ignorant of nor unsympathetic\r\nwith science that we have now to consider.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Importance of his account of magic.]\r\n\r\nWilliam’s account of magic is a remarkable and illuminating one. Most\r\nof it occurs in the closing chapters of the _De universo_. William\r\nhimself there states that nothing has come down from previous writers\r\non the things of which he has just been speaking.[1113] He admits\r\nthat his remarks are incomplete but he has at least made a beginning\r\nwhich will prove welcome to the reader. Probably, however, he is\r\nindebted to previous Christian writers; at any rate we recognize some\r\nof his statements as familiar. But he also has a wide acquaintance\r\nwith the literature of magic itself--in his youth he examined the\r\nbooks of judicial astronomy and the books of the magicians and\r\nsorcerers[1114]--and he combines the results of his reading in a sane\r\nmanner. We feel that his view is both comprehensive, including all\r\nthe essential factors, and marked by insight into the heart of the\r\nsituation. For his time at least he sees remarkably clearly what magic\r\nis, what it cannot do, and how it is related to the science of that age.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Its main points summarized.]\r\n\r\nThe chief characteristics of magic as it is depicted by William may\r\nfirst be briefly summarized, and then illustrated in more detail. He\r\nconstantly assumes that its great aim is to work marvels. He holds that\r\noften the ends are sought by the help of demons and methods which are\r\nidolatrous. Evil ends are often sought by magicians. On the other hand\r\nthe apparent marvels are often worked by mere human sleight-of-hand\r\nor other tricks and deceptions of the magicians themselves. But the\r\nmarvel may be neither human deceit nor the work of an evil spirit. It\r\nmay be produced by the wonderful occult virtues resident in certain\r\nobjects of nature. To marvels wrought in this manner William applies\r\nthe name “natural magic,” and has no doubt of its truth. But he denies\r\nthe validity of many methods and devices in which magicians trust,\r\nand contends that marvels cannot be so worked unless demons are\r\nresponsible. William furthermore constantly cites books of experiments\r\nand narrates the feats of “experimenters” in discussing magic, and he\r\noften implies a close connection of it with astronomy or astrology.\r\nHere again as in the case of natural magic we see an intimate\r\nconnection between the development of magic and of natural science.\r\nFinally, these various characteristics and varieties of magic are not\r\nalways kept distinct by William, but often overlap or join. The demons\r\navail themselves of the forces of nature in working their marvels and\r\ntheir marvels too are often only passing illusions and empty shams. The\r\nexperimenters and operators of natural magic also deal in momentary\r\neffects and deceptive appearances as well as in more solid results.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Demons and magic.]\r\n\r\nWilliam holds then that much of magic is performed by the aid of demons\r\nand involves the worship of them or other forms of idolatry.[1115] One\r\nreason why magic feats are so seldom performed in Christian lands and\r\nWilliam’s own time is that the power of the evil spirits has been so\r\nrepressed by Christianity. But the books of the magicians and of the\r\nsorcerers assume the existence of armies of spirits in the sky.[1116]\r\nIn the necromantic operation called “The Major Circle” four kings\r\nof demons from the four quarters of the earth appear with numerous\r\nattendants according to the statements of those who are skilled\r\nin works of this sort.[1117] William has also read in the books of\r\nexperiments that water can be made to appear where there really is none\r\nby use of a bow of a particular kind of wood, an arrow of another kind\r\nof wood, and a bow-string made of a particular sort of cord.[1118] As\r\nfar as an arrow is shot from this bow so far one is supposed to behold\r\nan expanse of water. But William does not believe that the bow and\r\narrow possess any such virtues, and hence concludes that the mirage is\r\nan illusion produced by the demons and that the ceremony performed by\r\nthe magician is a service to the evil spirits. Another writer in his\r\nbook of necromancy bids one to take as an oblation such and such a wood\r\nor stone or liquor on such a day at such an hour. Here too, perhaps\r\nbecause of what he regards as superstitious observance of times and\r\nseasons, William holds that the word “oblation” covers some diabolical\r\nservitude or cult, which has been concealed by the writers of such\r\nexperiments. He also states that sorcerers and idolaters often go off\r\ninto deserts to have dealings with the demons who dwell there.[1119] He\r\ncites “a certain magician in his book on magic arts” who says that in\r\norder to philosophize he went to places destitute of any inhabitant and\r\nthere lived for thirty years with those who dwelt in light and learned\r\nfrom them what he has written in his book.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Magic and idolatry.]\r\n\r\nIn his treatise _De legibus_ William, like Maimonides, endeavors to\r\nexplain some of the questionable provisions and prohibitions in the\r\nMosaic law as measures to guard against idolatry and magic.[1120]\r\nUnder the head of idolatry he groups not only the worship of idols\r\nproper and of demons, but also superstitious observance of the stars,\r\nthe elements, images, figures, words and names, times and seasons,\r\nbeginnings of actions and finding objects.[1121] In another passage\r\nhe adds the observance of dreams, auguries, constellations, sneezes,\r\nmeetings, days and hours, figures, marks, characters and images.[1122]\r\nAlso incantation is not without idolatry. Thus many features of the\r\nmagic arts are condemned by him.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Magic illusions.]\r\n\r\nWe come next to those magic works which are “mockeries of men or\r\nof demons.”[1123] First there are those transpositions which are\r\naccomplished by agility and hability of the hands and are popularly\r\ncalled _tractationes_ or _traiectationes_. They are a source of great\r\nwonderment until men learn how they are done. A second variety are\r\nmere apparitions which have no truth. Under this head fall certain\r\nmagic candles. One made of wax and sulphurated snakeskin, burned in a\r\ndark place filled with sticks or rushes makes the house seem full of\r\nwrithing serpents. William’s explanation of this is that the powdered\r\nsnakeskin as it burns makes the rushes appear similar in color to\r\nserpents, while the flickering of the flame gives the illusion that\r\nthey are moving. Possibly, however, this may be a defective recipe\r\nfor some firework like the modern “snake’s nest.” William is more\r\nsceptical whether in the light of a candle made of wax and the tears\r\nor _semen_ of an ass men would look like donkeys. He doubts whether\r\nwet tears would mix with wax or burn if they did, and whether these\r\ninternal fluids possess any of the substance, figure, and color of an\r\nass’s external appearance. He concedes nevertheless that the _semen_\r\nhas great virtue and that the sight is of all senses the most easily\r\ndeceived. At any rate “experimenters” (_experimentatores_) have said\r\nthings of this sort, and you may read in the books of experiments a\r\ntrick by which anyone’s hand is made to appear an ass’s foot, so that\r\nhe blushes to draw it from his bosom.[1124]\r\n\r\nThe work of necromancy called “The Major Circle” is also in the nature\r\nof a delusive appearance. The four demon kings from the four quarters\r\nof the earth seem to be accompanied by vast hosts of phantom horsemen,\r\njugglers, and musicians, but no prints of horses’ hoofs are visible\r\nafterwards. Moreover, if real horsemen appeared, they would be seen by\r\neveryone, not merely by those within the magic circle. Another common\r\napparition, produced by “these sorcerers and deceivers” by means of\r\nsacrifices and other evil observances which William will not reveal, is\r\na wonderful castle with gates, towers, walls, and citadel all complete.\r\nBut it is seen only during the magic operation and when it vanishes\r\nleaves no trace behind. William compares such illusions to some\r\nfantastic dream which leaves behind nothing but horror on the faces of\r\nthe participants. He argues that if corporeal things outside us make\r\nthe strong impression on our senses that they do, it is no wonder if\r\nspiritual substances like demons who are full of forms can impress our\r\nminds potently. It will, of course, occur to the modern reader that\r\nsuch illusions, like certain marvels of India, were perhaps produced by\r\nhypnotic or other suggestion. William notes that illusions of this sort\r\nare shown only to the gullible and “those ignorant of natural science,”\r\nand that necromancers dare not produce or suggest such phantasms in the\r\npresence of learned and rational men.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Natural magic.]\r\n\r\nThere are, nevertheless, occult forces and powers in nature and\r\nthose men who are acquainted with them work many marvels and would\r\nwork much more wonderful ones, if they had an abundant supply of the\r\nnecessary materials.[1125] This is “that part of natural science which\r\nis called natural magic.”[1126] “Philosophers call it necromancy or\r\n_philosophica_, perhaps quite improperly, and it is the eleventh part\r\nof all natural science.” This rather strange association of necromancy\r\nwith natural science for which William seems to apologize, we shall\r\nmeet again in Albertus Magnus and we have already met with it in\r\nGundissalinus, Daniel of Morley, and Al-Farabi. With them, however,\r\nnecromancy was one of only eight parts of natural science or astrology.\r\nIn a third passage William omits mention of necromancy, but again\r\nasserts that certain marvels are natural operations and that knowledge\r\nof them is one of the eleven parts of natural science.[1127] It is with\r\nit that the books of experiments are especially concerned.[1128] From\r\nthem and from “the books of natural narrations” you can learn “the\r\ncauses and reasons of certain magic works, especially those which are\r\nby the art of natural magic.” The materials possessed of the marvelous\r\nvirtues essential for this art are very rare in Europe, but in India\r\nand lands near it they abound, and hence natural magic flourishes\r\nvigorously there, and there are many experimenters there who work\r\nmarvels by their skill.[1129]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Natural magic is not concerned with demons.]\r\n\r\nBetween this natural magic and that due to demons William makes a\r\ndecided distinction.[1130] In natural magic nothing is done by the\r\naid of demons. The workers of the one are called _magi_ because they\r\ndo great things (_magna agentes_) although some may have evilly\r\ninterpreted the word as meaning evil-doers (_male agentes_).[1131] And\r\nthese others who perform such works by the aid of demons are to be\r\nregarded as evil-doers. William indeed perhaps uses the word _malefici_\r\n(sorcerers) more often than _magi_ for workers of evil magic, but he\r\ncannot be said to observe any such distinction uniformly. He does,\r\nhowever, express his intention of setting forth “the causes and ways\r\nand methods” by which even the phantasies and illusions of magic are\r\nproduced naturally, but of “perditious methods such as nefarious\r\nsacrifices and oblations and sacrilegious observances” he intends to\r\nreveal nothing.[1132] In natural magic William seems to see no harm\r\nwhatever, unless it is employed for evil ends. He grants, however,\r\nthat some of its works are so marvelous that they seem to the ignorant\r\nto be the works of gods or demons, and that this has been one cause\r\nof idolatry in times past.[1133] So in order that Christianity might\r\nprevail, it was ordered that anyone performing such works should be\r\nconsidered evil and a sorcerer (_malus et maleficus_), and that\r\nworks of this sort should be regarded as performed not by the virtue\r\nof any natural object but rather by the aid and power of demons.\r\nBut specialists in such matters are not “surprised at these feats\r\nbut glorify the Creator alone in them, knowing that nature alone in\r\naccordance with His omnipotent will operates both in the customary\r\nmanner known to men and contrary to custom not only in new ways but new\r\nthings.” In another context William again affirms that natural magic\r\ninvolves no offense or injury to the Creator unless one works evil or\r\ntoo curiously by that art.[1134]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Some instances of natural magic.]\r\n\r\nOne example of the marvels worked by means of natural magic is the\r\nsudden generation of such animals as frogs and worms. Here the natural\r\nprocesses of generation are hastened by applying certain aids, and\r\nWilliam does not doubt the assertion of Emuth that by mixing seeds new\r\nanimals can be bred.[1135] Other phenomena belonging under natural\r\nmagic are the marvels worked outside its own body by the soul of the\r\nbasilisk and certain other animals and certain human souls--a hint that\r\nthe power of fascination is natural magic.[1136] In short, all use of\r\noccult virtue in nature may be classed as natural magic.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: “The sense of nature.”]\r\n\r\nOf William’s statements concerning occult virtue we shall hear more\r\nunder that head. But we may note here what he says of “the sense of\r\nnature,”[1137] which he calls “one of the roots of natural magic,”\r\nwhich he often mentions, and which in his opinion accounts for a number\r\nof wonderful things.[1138] It is “a sublimer sense than any human\r\napprehension and nobler and more akin to prophecy.” By it one senses\r\nthe presence in the house of a burglar or harlot who is otherwise\r\nunperceived by any of the ordinary senses. By it some dogs can detect\r\na thief in a crowd.[1139] It is the mysterious power by which vultures\r\nforesee the coming battle, sheep detect the approach of the wolf, and\r\nthe spider that of the fly. William tells of a woman who could feel\r\nthe presence of the man she loved when he was two miles distant[1140]\r\nand of another woman who so abhorred her husband that she fell into\r\nan epileptic fit whenever he entered the house.[1141] In the main,\r\nthis sense of nature seems about the same as what other writers call\r\nthe power of natural divination. William, however, in several cases\r\naccounts for it by the strong sympathy or antipathy existing between\r\nthe two persons or animals concerned.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Magic’s too extreme pretensions.]\r\n\r\nWhile William accepts such marvels and strange forces, there are many\r\nclaims of magic which he refuses to grant.[1142] As we shall see later\r\nhe sets limits even to the powers of demons. Much less will he allow\r\nthe extreme powers asserted of human magicians. In the books of the\r\nmagicians appear subversions of nature of every sort. They would bind\r\nfire so that it cannot burn, robbers that they may not steal in a\r\ncertain region, a well or spring so that no water may be drawn from\r\nit, and so with merchants and ships. They would even stop water from\r\nflowing down hill. William contends that such works are possible only\r\nby divine miracle, and that if the Chaldeans, Egyptians, and Arabs\r\ncould really accomplish the lies in their books, they would have\r\nconquered the world long ago. Nay, the world would be at the mercy of\r\nany single magician or sorcerer (_magi seu malefici_). William then\r\nraises the objection that if two magicians tried to gain the same\r\nobject at once, the magic of one or the other would prove a failure or\r\nthey would both share an imperfect and half-way success, and in either\r\ncase the promises of their art would prove a failure. The same logic\r\nmight be applied to the advice how to succeed given to young men by\r\nsome of our “self-made” millionaires (are they _magi_ or _malefici_?)\r\nwho have exploited natural resources. William, however, goes on to\r\nexplain that the books of magic say that not all artificers are equally\r\nskilful or born under a lucky star. He points out the limitations of\r\nPharaoh’s magicians in much the usual manner.[1143]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Wax images.]\r\n\r\nWilliam not only denies that magic can attain some extreme results,\r\nbut also denies that some of the methods employed in magic are\r\nsuited or adequate to the ends aimed at. He especially attacks the\r\nemployment of images and characters, words, names, and incantations.\r\nThe use of wax images in magic to harm the person or thing of whom the\r\nimage is made seems to him a futile proceeding. He will not believe\r\nthat Nectanebo--the magician of the Pseudo-Callisthenes, it will be\r\nremembered--could sink the ships of the enemy by submerging wax images\r\nof them.[1144] Such magic images possess neither intelligence nor will,\r\nnor can they act by bodily virtue, since that requires contact either\r\ndirect or indirect to be effective.[1145] If someone suggests that\r\nthey act by sense of nature, he should know that inanimate objects are\r\nincapable of this.[1146] The only way in which the occasional seemingly\r\nsuccessful employment of such images can be accounted for is that\r\nwhen the magician does anything to the image, demons inflict the same\r\nsufferings upon the person against whom the image is used, and thus\r\ndeceive men into thinking that the virtue of the image accomplishes\r\nthis result.[1147]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Factitious gods.]\r\n\r\nHermes Trismegistus speaks to Asclepius in the _Liber de hellera_ or\r\n_De deo deorum_ of terrestrial gods, associated each with some material\r\nsubstance, such as stones and aromatics which have the natural force\r\nof divinity in them.[1148] Hermes, however, distinguished from natural\r\ngods “factitious gods,” or statues, idols, and images made by man,\r\ninto which “the splendor of deity and virtue of divinity” is poured or\r\nimpressed by celestial spirits or the heavens and stars, “and this with\r\nobservation of the hours and constellations when the image is cast or\r\nengraved or fabricated.” William regrets to say that traces of this\r\nerror still prevail “among many old women, and Christians at that.”\r\nAnd they say that sixty years after their manufacture these images lose\r\ntheir virtue. William does not believe that there is divinity in stones\r\nor herbs or aromatics, or that men can make gods of any sort.[1149]\r\nMinds and souls cannot be put into statues,[1150] and William concludes\r\nthat Trismegistus “erred shamefully” and “was marvelously deceived by\r\nthe evil spirits themselves.”[1151] He also calls impossible “what is\r\nso celebrated among the astrologers (_astronomos_), and written in so\r\nmany of the books, namely, that a statue will speak like a man if one\r\ncasts it of bronze in the rising of Saturn.”[1152]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Characters and figures.]\r\n\r\nWilliam likewise holds that characters or figures or impressions or\r\nastrological images have no force unless they are tokens by which the\r\nevil spirits may recognize their worshipers.[1153] There is no divinity\r\nin the angles of Solomon’s pentagon. William states that some are led\r\ninto this error from their theories concerning the stars, and that\r\nthe idolatrous cult of the stars distinguishes four kinds of figures:\r\nseals, rings, characters, and images.[1154] Such are the rings and\r\nseal of Solomon with their “execrable consecrations and detestable\r\ninvocations.” Even more unspeakable is that image called _idea\r\nSalomonis et entocta_, and the figure known as _mandel_ or _amandel_.\r\nSo excessive are the virtues attributed to such images that they belong\r\nonly to God, so that it is evident that God has been shorn of His glory\r\nwhich has been transferred to such figures. Artesius in his book on the\r\nvirtue of words and characters asserts that by a certain magic figure\r\nhe bound a mill so that the wheels could not turn.[1155] But William is\r\nincredulous as to such powers in characters. He thinks that one might\r\nas well say that virtue of the figure would run the mill without water\r\nor mill-wheels. If the mill did stop, it must have been the work of\r\ndemons. Nor can William see any sense in writing the day and hour when\r\nthunder was heard in that locality on the walls of houses in order to\r\nprotect them from lightning.[1156] It seems to him an attribution of\r\nthe strongest force to the weakest sort of an incidental occurrence.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Power of words denied.]\r\n\r\nWilliam indeed denies that there is magic power in mere words or\r\nincantations. Mere words cannot kill men or animals as sorcerers\r\nclaim.[1157] William argues scholastically that if spoken words\r\npossessed any such virtue they must derive it either from the material\r\nof which they are composed, air, or from their form, sound; or from\r\nwhat they signify. Air cannot kill unless it is poisoned by a plague,\r\ndragon, or toad. Sound to kill must be deafening. If what is signified\r\nby the word is the cause, then images, which are more exact likenesses,\r\nwould be more powerful than words. William’s opinion is that when\r\nsorcerers employ magic words and incantations they are simply calling\r\nupon the demons for aid, just as the worshipers of God sometimes induce\r\nHim to work wonders by calling upon His name.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Use of divine names.]\r\n\r\nThis brings William to the delicate question of divine names. He\r\ncensures the use of the name of God by “magicians and astronomers”\r\nin “working their diabolical marvels.”[1158] He also notes that they\r\nemploy a barbaric name and not one of the four Hebrew names of God.\r\nThey forbid anyone who is not pure and clad in pure vestments to\r\npresume to touch the book in which this name is written, but they\r\ntry to gain evil ends by it and so blaspheme against their Creator.\r\nWilliam, however, seems to feel that the names of God have a virtue not\r\nfound in ordinary words and he states that not only servants of God\r\nbut even wicked men sometimes cast out demons by making use of holy\r\nexorcisms.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Christian magic.]\r\n\r\nIn short, incantations possess no efficacy, but exorcisms do. This\r\nis an indication, not merely of William’s logical inconsistency, but\r\nalso of the existence of a Christian or ecclesiastical variety of\r\nmagic in his day. He will not believe in Nectanebo’s wax images, but\r\nhe believes that the forms of wax which have the likeness of lambs\r\nreceive through the benediction of the pope the virtue of warding off\r\nthunderbolts.[1159] He denied that magic words had efficacy through\r\ntheir sound but he affirms that consecrated bells prevent storms within\r\nthe sound of their ringing, and that salt and water which have been\r\nblessed obtain the power of expelling demons. William, however, takes\r\nrefuge in God’s omnipotent virtue to explain the efficacy of these\r\nChristian charms.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Magic of sex and generation.]\r\n\r\nMagic appears to have always devoted considerable attention to matters\r\nof sex and generation, and William’s works give one or two instances of\r\nthis. He states that sorcerers investigate the cohabiting of certain\r\nanimals, thinking that if they kill them at that hour they will obtain\r\nfrom their carcasses potent love-charms and aids to fecundity.[1160]\r\nWe are also told that men have tried to produce, and thought that they\r\nsucceeded in producing human life in other ways than by the usual\r\ngenerative process.[1161] “And in the books of experiments may be found\r\nmockeries of women similar to those which the demons called _incubi_\r\nwork and which certain sorcerers have attempted and left in writing for\r\nposterity.” They have recorded a delusive experiment by which women who\r\nhave been known only once or twice think that this has occurred fifty\r\nor sixty times.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: William’s contribution to the bibliography of magic.]\r\n\r\nAs has been already incidentally suggested, William offers considerable\r\ninformation as to the bibliography of magic in his day. Besides his\r\nmany general allusions to works of magic, writings of sorcerers and\r\nprestidigitateurs and astrologers and books of experiments, he mentions\r\nseveral particular works ascribed to Aristotle and Avicenbros, to\r\nHermes Trismegistus and Solomon, the “cursed book” of Cocogrecus on\r\n“Stations to the cult of Venus” and, what is perhaps the same, of Thot\r\ngrecus on “The cult of Venus.”[1162] An Artesius or Arthesius, whom\r\nin one passage he calls a magician and cites concerning divination\r\nby water and whom in another passage he calls both a magician and\r\na philosopher who had written a book on the virtue of words and\r\ncharacters,[1163] is probably the same Artesius who is cited concerning\r\ndivination by the rays of the sun or moon in liquids or mirrors in a\r\nwork of alchemy in a twelfth century manuscript,[1164] and further\r\nidentical with the Artephius who Roger Bacon says lived for one\r\nthousand and twenty-five years,[1165] to whom a treatise is ascribed in\r\nthe _Theatrum Chymicum_[1166] and a Sloane manuscript,[1167] and who\r\nseems to have been the same as Altughra’i, a poet and alchemist who\r\ndied in 1128.[1168] There also are a number of magic books of which\r\nWilliam does not give the author’s name or the title, but of which\r\nhe gives descriptions or from which he makes citations which would\r\nbe sufficiently definite to identify the works should one meet with\r\nthem elsewhere. In our chapters on pseudo-literature and experimental\r\nliterature we treat of many of these works.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Plan of the rest of this chapter.]\r\n\r\nFrom our survey of magic proper as delineated in William’s works we now\r\nturn to what he represents as the two chief forces in magic, namely,\r\nthe demons and the occult virtues in nature, and to two subjects which\r\nhe closely connects with magic, namely, divination and astrology. These\r\nfour topics will be taken up separately in the order stated.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The theory of spiritual substances.]\r\n\r\nSince William attributes so much of magic to demons, it is important\r\nto note what he has to say concerning these “spiritual substances.” He\r\nproposes to follow as his sources on the subject “authentic accounts”\r\n(_sermones authentici_): first of all the statements of the divinely\r\ninspired prophets, and after that the opinions of the philosophers\r\nand also of the magicians. He observes elsewhere, however, that\r\nthere is a lack of literature on the subject; the sages have only\r\ndipped into it and not yet plumbed it to its depths: in fact, only\r\nthe treatise of Avicenbros has come to his hands, and while that\r\nauthority has said and written many sublime things, far removed from\r\npopular comprehension, still he has made only a beginning in this\r\nfield.[1169] William also utilizes, however, the works of Hermes\r\nTrismegistus[1170] and other books of necromancy and magic--among them\r\nThot Graecus[1171]--the testimony of medical men[1172] and “innumerable\r\nexperiences” of men at large.[1173]\r\n\r\nWilliam professes himself open to conviction and new light on the\r\nquestion of the assumption of bodies by good and bad spirits.[1174]\r\nAnd it must be said that his whole treatment of spirits is full of\r\ninconsistencies and difficulties. Part of the time he draws a hard\r\nand fast line between spiritual substances and physical creation, but\r\nonly part of the time. He also essays the difficult task of explaining\r\nhow and to what extent these spiritual substances are able to disturb\r\nphysical creation, and how far they in turn are affected by it.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Spirits in the heavens.]\r\n\r\nTo begin with, William takes up the difficult position--or rather\r\nhe makes it difficult for himself--but the usual one with medieval\r\ntheologians, that angels occupy physical space and are located in their\r\nown heaven as the stars are in theirs.[1175] Some modern believers\r\nin spiritualism hold a very similar position.[1176] He also declares\r\nthat the tenth and last or empyrean heaven will be the eternal abode\r\nof men whose souls are saved, although the resurrected bodies of the\r\nsaved would presumably still be corporal substances.[1177] This raises\r\nthe further difficulty that apparently the empyrean heaven cannot\r\nbe the abode of the angels, as some theologians and saintly doctors\r\nhave held (for a corporal place cannot be filled except with corporal\r\nsubstances), for those superficial persons who mock the authentic\r\ndivine revelation of scripture will say that “if that heaven is a\r\ncorporal place it cannot be filled except by corporal substances.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Will hell be big enough?]\r\n\r\nAnother point which puzzles William is whether there will be room in\r\nhell for all the evil spirits and resurrected bodies of the damned\r\ndestined to make it their ultimate abode. The infernal regions,\r\nlocated in the interior of our terrestrial globe, seem very small to\r\nhim compared with the vast expanse of the empyrean heaven which is\r\neven greater than that of the fixed stars. And our earth is a mere dot\r\ncompared to the sphere of the fixed stars. If then that entire empyrean\r\nheaven is to be filled with glorified men, how shall the infernal\r\nregions hold all the damned?[1178] It will be seen that Dante’s later\r\ncosmology is very similar to William’s.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Astrological necromancy.]\r\n\r\nWilliam will not agree, however,[1179] with the books of magic and\r\nthe masters of images and illusions that the starry heavens and even\r\nsingle planets are inhabited by spirits so that the circle of the moon\r\nhas fifty ministering spirits and that there are also angels in the\r\ntwelve signs of the zodiac. On the other hand, in an earlier chapter\r\nhe makes the statement that he has never heard anywhere even in magic\r\nbooks of demons with power over celestial bodies.[1180] William is of\r\nthe opinion that Aristotle was deceived by an evil spirit into boasting\r\nthat a spirit had descended to him from the circle of Venus.[1181]\r\nWilliam argues that the starry heavens are _rational_ and able to\r\nregulate themselves and do not require any ministering angels; and on\r\nthe other hand that the nobler spirits would not debase themselves by\r\nministering to mere celestial _bodies_.[1182] William’s own theory is\r\nthat demons dwell in the air about the earth and not in the planetary\r\nheavens. He also speaks in one passage of their especially frequenting\r\ndeserts.[1183]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: False accounts of fallen angels.]\r\n\r\nWilliam also rejects[1184] some non-Christian assertions concerning\r\nfallen angels. One is the statement of the author of a book of sorcery,\r\nwho claimed to have communed with spirits thirty years, to the effect\r\nthat new spirits are created daily, and that there are twelve orders\r\nof them, and that every day a multitude of them fall and that they\r\nfall into different regions of the earth and there rule--some in\r\ndeserts, some in woods, some in fountains and rivers, some in herbs and\r\ntrees, some in gems and stones, which thus derive their marvel-working\r\nqualities from them. The other account rejected by William is a\r\npretty story from Hermes to this effect.[1185] When two angels were\r\ncriticizing mankind harshly for its sinfulness God incarnated them to\r\nsee how much better they would do. Both promptly fell in love with a\r\nbeautiful woman who would return their love only on condition that they\r\nrenounce God. When they had done even this, God called them to heaven,\r\nreproved them for not having justified their criticism of sinful\r\nmankind, and told them to choose now their place of punishment. They\r\nselected the air, but later through the prayers of a prophet in Babylon\r\nwere shut up in a cave to await their final punishment at the last\r\njudgment.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Different kinds of spirits.]\r\n\r\nWilliam of course makes the usual sharp Christian distinction between\r\ngood spirits or angels and bad spirits or demons. It is the latter\r\nalone, rather than spiritual substances in general, whom he connects\r\nwith magic, although naturally the magicians themselves often claim to\r\nemploy good spirits. William is in doubt whether fauns and pygmies\r\nand some other monsters are demons or animals or men.[1186] He also\r\nlists satyrs, _joculatores_, incubi, succubi, nymphs, Lares, Penates\r\nand other old Latin names such as _cloacina_, _Lucina_, _limitanus_,\r\n_priapus_, _genius_, _hymenus_.[1187] He regards as a delusion the\r\nbelief fostered by old-wives in demons who injure infants.[1188]\r\nDespite his mention of incubi and succubi and despite the verses of\r\nScripture about the sons of God and the daughters of men and that woman\r\nought to veil her head on account of the angels, he regards demons as\r\nincapable of sexual intercourse with human beings, but he thinks it\r\npossible that they may juggle with nature so as to produce the effects\r\nof sexual intercourse.[1189] He mentions the belief in a demon who\r\ncomes to cellars at night in women’s clothing and bestows abundance and\r\nprosperity where food and drink is left uncovered for it to partake\r\nof, which it does without diminishing the quantity. “And they call her\r\n_satia_ from satiety.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Limited demon control of nature.]\r\n\r\nWhat is the extent of the control over matter exercised by the demons\r\nin performing marvels? In discussing what demons can and cannot perform\r\nin the ways of marvels, William’s decisions seem rather arbitrary and\r\ncapricious.[1190] He grants them superhuman powers of divination and\r\nsays that it has been repeatedly proved that they know when invocations\r\nand sacrifices are made to them.[1191] But the apparitions which they\r\nproduce are neither real objects nor images in the air but thoughts\r\nand pictures in the mind of the beholder.[1192] The armies of horsemen\r\nproduced by necromancers leave no prints of hoofs behind them and their\r\nelaborate castles with gates, towers, walls, and citadel completely\r\nvanish without leaving a trace.[1193] This explains how enchanters and\r\nmagicians can apparently cut horses in two, although William grants\r\nit not unlikely that there may be other ways of doing this for those\r\n“who know the marvellous occult virtues of many things.” William also\r\ndiscusses how demons can toss sticks and stones about, throw persons\r\nout of bed, and transport men or huge rocks for great distances when\r\nthey have neither necks nor shoulders to carry them on.[1194] This is\r\nno more strange, he says, than the magnet’s ability to draw iron.[1195]\r\nHe believes that the virtue of spiritual substances can overcome weight\r\nwhich holds bodies at rest and produce lightness which makes motion\r\neasy. It was thus that an angel transported one of the Hebrew prophets\r\nto Babylon by a lock of his hair. It is doubtful, however, if this last\r\ncould have been accomplished save by divine aid. He doubts furthermore\r\nif horses could be generated as the frogs were by the Egyptian\r\nmagicians of Pharaoh. The generation of frogs is a much easier and more\r\nrapid process. Also the wax lights which mysteriously appear in stables\r\non the horses’ manes and tails would be easy for demons to make.[1196]\r\nBut William disbelieves in such magic transformations as werwolves. His\r\nexplanation is that the devil first made the man imagine himself a wolf\r\nand then caused a real wolf to appear and frighten people.[1197] Demons\r\ncannot make idols or images speak, but when the bodies of human beings\r\nare possessed by demons, they form voices after a fashion, although, as\r\nexorcists have assured him, in a raucous tone unlike the usual human\r\nvoice, probably because the vocal chords respond but indifferently to\r\ndemoniacal abuse of them.[1198]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Can demons be imprisoned or enter bodies?]\r\n\r\nWilliam is sure that demons cannot be imprisoned against their will in\r\nmaterial bodies, whether rings, gems, mirrors, or glass phials such as\r\nSolomon is said to have shut them up in.[1199] William argues that if\r\na man died in a huge corked bottle his soul would be able to get out.\r\nWilliam, however, believes his Bible when it tells him of demons shut\r\nup in men whom “they vex with innumerable tortures,” or in swine or\r\nin lakes,[1200] although he declares that he does not adduce the case\r\nof demons in swine because it is recorded in the Bible but because\r\nit is attested by the experience of many. And he declares that even\r\nto his day demons give most certain indication of their presence in\r\nlakes when stones are thrown in or they are provoked by some other\r\nmovement or sound.[1201] He states, however, that many medical men deny\r\nthat human beings are possessed by demons and attribute the seizures\r\nand agitations to fumes and vapors.[1202] Many skilled doctors also\r\ndispute the existence of the nocturnal demon called _ephialtes_ and\r\nattribute the oppressive feeling to action of the heart and not to the\r\nweight of a demon. In this instance William is inclined to agree with\r\nthe physicians.[1203] William holds that it is useless to strike at\r\ndemons when they appear before you, for you merely beat the air, as\r\nmany experiments have shown.[1204] But he believes that demons can be\r\npunished not only by material hell fire but by contact with the other\r\nthree elements, air, earth and water.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Susceptibility of demons to the four elements and to natural\r\nobjects.]\r\n\r\nDemons feel any affront offered or indignity done them very keenly so\r\nthat saints have often routed them by a volley of spit. William is also\r\ninclined to accept the “ancient opinion among the Romans” that human\r\nurine dissolves works of magic.[1205] Furthermore there are several\r\nnatural objects which have the occult virtue of driving away demons,\r\na peony suspended from the neck--Galen’s old remedy for the epileptic\r\nboy--or the top of the heart of a certain fish placed on the coals. If\r\nit is asked how it is that these proud spiritual substances are thus\r\nsubject to the virtues of physical bodies, William can only answer that\r\nit is probably in consequence of their fall, which also subjected them\r\nto hell fire. William’s logic simply reduces to this, that God can do\r\nanything He pleases with demons while men can do nothing with them\r\nagainst the demons’ wills and without imperiling their own souls.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Stock examples of natural marvels.]\r\n\r\nWilliam is as credulous concerning the marvelous powers attributed\r\nto herbs, gems and animals, and as anxious to find some plausible\r\nexplanation of their validity, as he was sceptical in regard to images,\r\ncharacters and words. We encounter once more in his pages many of the\r\nstock examples of natural marvels which we have met again and again\r\nin previous writers and shall find in many writers after him. He\r\nrhapsodizes concerning the power of the magnet and mentions its three\r\nspecies according to Hermes (Mercurius).[1206] He tells of the phoenix,\r\nof the masculine and feminine palms, and of theriac.[1207] Indeed, the\r\nmagnet, the palms, and the story of the hazel rod told below are all\r\nintroduced while William is supposedly discussing divine providence.\r\nIn more than one passage he tells--perhaps directly from Pliny--of\r\nthe stupefaction produced by the _torpedo_ in persons who touch it\r\nonly with a long stick, of the little _echinus_ or _remora_ which\r\nstops great ships, or of the powers of lion and basilisk, and of the\r\ngem heliotrope which aided by the virtue of the herb of the same name\r\nrenders one invisible.[1208] For this assertion concerning heliotrope,\r\nhowever, which Pliny stigmatized as an example of the magicians’\r\nimpudence,[1209] William cites the writings of experimenters.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The hazel rod story.]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, a passage in William’s work concerning the property\r\nof a hazel rod was repeated within a few years by at least three\r\nwriters: Albertus Magnus, John of St. Amand, and Roger Bacon. William\r\nrelates that men say that if the rod is split in two lengthwise\r\nthe halves will approach one another again of their own accord and\r\nreunite.[1210] Deceivers attribute this to the virtue of certain words\r\nwhich they utter, but it is by virtue and sense of nature.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Occult virtues of herbs and animals.]\r\n\r\nWilliam regards the occult virtue of things on this earth as so certain\r\nthat he uses it to argue that the stars too must possess great\r\npowers.[1211] This is attested “from the operations of the virtues of\r\nother things, both animals and parts of them, also herbs, medicines,\r\nand stones.”[1212] Of medicines he especially recommends the _empirica_\r\nto the reader’s consideration.[1213] The virtues of herbs have been\r\nproved to be very numerous and very marvelous.[1214] As for animals,\r\nafter describing the virtues of the basilisk, William adds, “and when\r\nyou have heard similar and maybe greater things concerning the occult\r\nvirtues of other animals, you will not marvel at these.” Among many\r\nmedicines which prolong life he believes that the flesh of snakes has\r\ngreat renovating virtue,[1215] and among medicines supposed to produce\r\nvisions and revelations he names the eye of an Indian tortoise and\r\nthe heart of the hoopoe,[1216] which are thought to clear the soul of\r\nnoxious vapors in sleep and pave the way for illuminations. William\r\nsuggests that these substances may horrify one so as to shock the soul\r\nfree from the body. He even mentions a medicine the smoke from which\r\nin the room in which one is sleeping will free the soul from the body\r\nso that it emerges into the region of light and the luminosity of the\r\nCreator.[1217] And in the case of the little fish which binds ships\r\nso that they cannot move, he holds it indubitable that this cannot\r\npossibly be done by any bodily virtue which it possesses and must be by\r\nsome spiritual virtue which exists in its soul.[1218] This reminds him\r\nof the power of the human imagination as shown in the case of the man\r\nwho cast down a camel by merely imagining its fall.[1219]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Virtues of gems.]\r\n\r\nTo the virtues of gems William alludes a number of times. He recounts\r\nhow the sapphire of its own motion springs into a diseased human eye\r\nand cleanses it of its noxious humors.[1220] He also finds it asserted\r\nthat the emerald attracts riches to its owner and that the topaz\r\nchecks the passions of avarice, cupidity, luxury, and evil desire. He\r\nendeavors to explain how it may be possible for the stone heliotrope to\r\nrender one invisible; as the power of the stone turns the brightness\r\nof the sunlight to a ruby shade, so it may be that the potency of its\r\ncolor prevents the spectators from discerning at all the color of the\r\nman who wears it, just as it is said that a musical instrument strung\r\nwith snake-skin drowns the sound of all other instruments.[1221]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A medley of marvelous virtues.]\r\n\r\nSome of the virtues ascribed to natural objects William finds\r\nalmost too marvelous for belief, but then strengthens his faith by\r\nrecollecting some others which are more marvelous still, as the\r\nfollowing passage will illustrate.[1222] The experimenters have put in\r\ntheir books the marvelous statement that the presence of a serpent or\r\nof a reed containing some quicksilver affects sorcerers and magicians\r\nso that their juggleries and incantations are of no avail. William, who\r\nit will be recalled had elsewhere denied the ability of a magic figure\r\nto stop a mill-wheel, is also inclined to question whether serpents\r\nor quicksilver have any power over evil spirits and incantations. But\r\nthen he remembers that the experimenters also assert that a crab hung\r\nin mid-air keeps moles who move underground out of the field and that\r\nthe herb peony drives devils out of demoniacs. Since the peony has many\r\nvirtues necessary for men and demons hate men, William thinks it likely\r\nthat they hate the herb too, and flee from it, when it is suspended\r\nabout one’s neck. And in one of the books of the Hebrews it is\r\nexpressly stated that one of the holy angels said that the top of the\r\nheart of a certain fish placed on live coals would drive any kind of\r\ndemon out of men or women. This book is received as authentic by both\r\nHebrews and Christians, and William also regards an archangel as a good\r\nauthority. This being established, he sees no reason why a snake may\r\nnot have power over demons too. He recalls too the ancient belief among\r\nthe Romans that human urine dissolves all works of magic; the manifest\r\nfact that jasper drives away snakes and that eagles place it in their\r\nnests for this reason; and that the gem achates or agate taken powdered\r\nin drink causes the unchaste to vomit. In Great Britain they test the\r\nmorals of boys and girls by this experiment. This property of the agate\r\ncauses William to marvel much, for he sees no connection between stones\r\nand virginity. However, if the agate is incompatible with unchastity,\r\nwhat wonder if quicksilver will not tolerate the working of magic in\r\nits presence?\r\n\r\nIt has been made evident that William accepts very extreme powers in\r\nnatural objects and that with such resources the possibilities of his\r\nnatural magic should be well-nigh unlimited. If he does not quite\r\nbelieve in all these marvels, he does not definitely deny them, and\r\nevidently enjoys repeating them.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Divination not an art but revelation.]\r\n\r\nWilliam states that the proper meaning of divination is imitation\r\nof the deity, but that the term is usually not applied to the\r\nrevelations made by good spirits and prophets but to the revelation\r\nof hidden things, especially the future, by evil spirits.[1223] For\r\nhe also affirms that divination is not a human art but a matter of\r\nrevelation. The medical prognostications of physicians, although they\r\nmay seem occult to other men, are based on experience of their art and\r\nastronomers are not called diviners but men of learning. While William\r\nmay deny that the diviner is an _artifex_, he has to admit that some\r\ndiviners use tools or materials and so give their predictions the\r\nappearance of being based upon some art.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Divination by inspection of lucid surfaces.]\r\n\r\nOf this type is the practice of predicting the future by gazing upon\r\npolished and reflecting surfaces which are rubbed with oil to increase\r\ntheir lucidity.[1224] Among the substances employed are mirrors,\r\ntwo-edged swords, children’s finger-nails, egg shells, and ivory\r\nhandles. Usually a boy or a virgin is employed to gaze thereupon,\r\nand sometimes exorcisms, adjurations, and observance of times are\r\nadded. William affirms that many experiences have demonstrated that\r\nonly one boy out of seven or ten sees anything therein, and he is of\r\nthe opinion that the whole apparatus simply conceals “the impiety of\r\ndiabolical sacrifices.” Some ancient sages, nevertheless, notably\r\nPlato, have thought that the soul of the gazer is thrown back upon\r\nitself by the luminosity of the object seen and then exercises its\r\nlatent powers of natural divination. We sometimes see such revelations\r\nby the irradiation of spiritual light in the insane, the very ill,\r\ndreamers, and those in whom because of great fright or care the mind\r\nis abstracted from the body.[1225] William therefore finally concludes\r\nthat the theory of the philosophers as to divination by inspection of\r\nlucid bodies “is undoubtedly possible,” but he still maintains that\r\ndemons are often involved.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Other instances of divination, ancient and modern.]\r\n\r\nWilliam also tells us of an ancient Latin magician who believed that\r\nthe soul of an immaculate boy who had been slain by violence would have\r\nknowledge of past, present and future.[1226] He therefore murdered a\r\nboy, and then went insane himself and imagined that he heard responses\r\nfrom the boy’s soul. This was surely the work of demons. Other ancient\r\nphilosophers blinded boys or themselves in order to increase the power\r\nof the soul in divination.[1227] William further mentions the old-wives\r\nof his own time who still persisted in divination and interpreting\r\ndreams and could not be made to desist even by beatings.[1228] He\r\nstates that these old women still cherished the superstition of the\r\naugurs that if you find a bird’s nest with the mother bird and little\r\nones or the eggs, and preserve it intact, all will go well with you,\r\nwhile if you harm it or separate any bird or egg from it you will\r\nencounter ill fortune.[1229]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: His treatment of astrology.]\r\n\r\nWilliam has much to say in his various works of the heavens and the\r\nstars, and he rarely overlooks an opportunity to have a tilt with\r\nthe astrologers. Most of his statements and arguments had been often\r\nemployed before, however, and he also repeats himself a great deal, and\r\nhis long-drawn scholastic listing and rebutting of supposed reasons\r\npro and con at times becomes insufferably tedious. We shall therefore\r\ncompress his treatment to a very small space compared to that which it\r\noccupies in his own works and words.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The philosophers on the nature of the heavens and stars.]\r\n\r\nWilliam states that Plato and Aristotle, Boethius, Hermes Trismegistus,\r\nand Avicenna, all believed the stars to be divine animals whose souls\r\nwere as superior to ours, as their celestial bodies are.[1230] Since\r\nthese philosophers regarded the stars as nobler, wiser, and more\r\npowerful than mortals, they made them guardians and guides of humanity,\r\nand distributed all earthly objects under their rule. Such doctrines\r\nWilliam recalls examining when he was young in the books of judicial\r\nastrology and the volumes of magicians and sorcerers, from whom he\r\nwould appear to distinguish the above-named philosophers none too\r\ncarefully. He indeed explicitly classes “Plato and Aristotle and their\r\nfollowers” with “those who believe in judgments of the stars.”[1231]\r\nHe also tells us that Plato regarded the entire universe as one divine\r\nanimal, and that his followers regarded the tides as the breathing of\r\nthis world animal; but that Aristotle and his school included only what\r\nis above the moon or even only the heaven of the fixed stars.[1232]\r\nAvicenna, too, called the heaven an animal obedient to God.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: William’s own opinion and attitude.]\r\n\r\nWilliam himself is inclined to think that the divisions and diversities\r\nof the nine spheres militate against their being animated by a single\r\nsoul; and he rejects the theory that the world soul is composed of\r\nnumber and musical consonance.[1233] But he leaves Christians free,\r\nif they will, to believe with the Aristotelians and many Italian\r\nphilosophers that the superior world is either one or many animals,\r\nthat the heavens are either animated or rational.[1234] In this he\r\nsees no peril to the Faith; but hitherto Hebrew and Christian doctrine\r\nhas not explored such matters, and Christians have been too absorbed\r\nin saving men’s souls to note whether the heavens had souls or no.\r\nIt would indeed be strange if William denied the starry heavens some\r\nsort of soul or souls when he has attributed one to a sea-fish like\r\nthe echinus.[1235] But he declares that “it is manifest that human\r\nsouls are nobler than those which they put in heavenly bodies.” And\r\nhe warns against the wicked error of identifying the Holy Spirit with\r\nthe world soul. We have noted elsewhere his hostility to the theory\r\nof astrological necromancy that the heavens and stars are full of\r\nministering spirits. He also contraverts the Aristotelian doctrines\r\nthat there are as many intelligences moving the heavenly bodies\r\nas there are celestial motions and that the heavens love superior\r\nintelligences and strive to become assimilated to these.[1236]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Objection to stars as cause of evil.]\r\n\r\nLike most Christian apologists William adopts the argument that\r\nthe stars, if rational, would not cause evils and misfortunes such\r\nas astrologers predict, and seems to think that all the evil in\r\nthe world can be charged to the account of human perversity or the\r\nimperfections inherent in the matter of our inferior world, and that\r\nfor these two sources of ill neither God nor the stars should be held\r\nresponsible.[1237] He recognizes, it is true, that someone may argue\r\nthat these evils exist by the will of the Creator, whose will is\r\nnevertheless always good, but he does not seem to see that the same\r\nreasoning may be applied to the rule of the stars. He seems to regard\r\nas a new discovery of his own and a point hitherto unrecognized by\r\nastrologers, the argument that ineptitude on the part of inferior\r\nmatter receiving the force of the stars may account for many effects\r\napparently due to the heavens. But in thinking this argument novel he\r\nis much mistaken. Really his only point here against astrologers is\r\nthat some of them are careless in their phraseology and speak of the\r\nstars as causing evil, which he regards as blasphemy of Him who created\r\nthe stars. “And all blasphemy against the Creator,” continues William\r\nin a truculent and intolerant tone which reveals the spirit of the\r\nmedieval inquisition, “is an impiety to be exterminated with fire and\r\nsword.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Virtues of the stars.]\r\n\r\nWilliam raises certain difficulties in regard to astrological technique\r\nonly to answer them himself. And he grants that fixed stars which\r\nseem close together may really be separated by vast distances and so\r\nhave very different virtue. And he cannot deny “many marvelous and\r\noccult virtues” in celestial bodies, when he admits “so many and so\r\ngreat occult virtues” in terrestrial bodies. Indeed all philosophers\r\nagree that the virtues of the stars far surpass even those of precious\r\nstones. The variations in the heat of the sun, while its course\r\ncontinues constant, seem to William a sure indication that the other\r\nplanets and fixed stars participate in influencing our world.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Extent of their influence upon nature and man.]\r\n\r\nWhile William was not unwilling to concede souls or reason to the\r\nstars, he believes that it is perilous for Christians to regard the\r\nsouls of the heavens as “governors of inferior things and especially\r\nof human affairs.”[1238] Those who hold that man’s actions are caused\r\nof necessity by the motion of the sky and the positions of the stars,\r\nruin, in his opinion, the foundations of law and morality.[1239]\r\n“Against that error, one ought not so much to dispute with arguments\r\nas fight with fire and sword.” Some have argued that because stars\r\nand lights were created before vegetation, animal life, and human\r\nbeings, they are causes of these others, both generating and regulating\r\nthem.[1240] In favor of this contention so much has been written that\r\nit can scarcely be read, says William, and the stars do give much\r\naid in generation and in conservation of generated things, but not\r\nso much as the astrologers think.[1241] They should not be consulted\r\neven as signs--rather than causes--in human concerns.[1242] In our\r\nsublunar world their power extends only to the four elements and\r\nfour humors and only to such animals composed of these as lack free\r\nwill and obey natural necessity. Thus William really excludes only\r\nhuman free will and intellect from sidereal control,[1243] and he\r\nadmits that “the multitude and populace from want of intelligence and\r\nother evil dispositions lives almost after the manner of brutes,”\r\nfollowing natural impulse to a great extent, so that astrologers may\r\npredict popular agitations and mob uprisings with a fair degree of\r\naccuracy, but should not predict concerning individuals. Even in the\r\ncase of individuals, however, he does not deny that natural virtues\r\nand vices are attributable to the stars, such vices, for instance, as\r\nirascibility, levity, and lubricity, which medical authorities ascribe\r\nnot to moral fault but physical constitution.[1244] William would limit\r\nthe influence of the stars not only by individual freedom of the will\r\nbut by the power of prayer.[1245] He does not believe the decrees of\r\nfate so fixed and the laws of nature so unchangeable that God’s wrath\r\nmay not be placated by prayer, and freedom from any threatening evil\r\nobtained from His goodness. Belief in the power of the stars and belief\r\nin the power of prayers: which is the more superstitious, which the\r\nmore nearly scientific? Or which belief has led to progress in science?\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Against nativities, interrogations, and images.]\r\n\r\nWilliam complains that “Ptolemy and Haly and other astronomers” have\r\nattributed original sin and all its consequences to the constellations\r\nand hours of nativity, in that they have presumed to write books\r\nof horoscopes and nativities.[1246] He feels it “necessary to say\r\nsomething against that insanity” because of the great reputation such\r\nfamous writers have among the “simple and stupid multitude” which\r\nregards them as profound sages and sublime prophets. Into William’s\r\nparticular arguments against the art of casting nativities, which much\r\nresemble the arguments of Augustine and John of Salisbury, we will not\r\ngo. Elsewhere he also attacks the practice of interrogations.[1247]\r\nHe also strongly objects to the books which he says astrologers have\r\nwritten on discovering men’s secret thoughts through the significations\r\nof the stars.[1248]\r\n\r\nWilliam has much to say against astrological images, but his attitude\r\nhas already been partially indicated in stating his attitude towards\r\nimages, figures, and characters in general. He declares that belief\r\nin astrological images “derogates more from the honor and glory of\r\nthe Creator than the error which attributes such virtue to the stars\r\nand luminaries themselves.” It seems to him “a strange and quite\r\nintolerable error to think that stars which cannot help themselves\r\ncan bestow such gifts as invincibility, social graces, temperance or\r\nchastity.”[1249] Yet elsewhere we have heard him mention with seeming\r\ncomplaisance the bestowal of riches and checking of evil passions\r\nby emeralds and topazes. His best argument as against figures and\r\ncharacters in general is that such lifeless bodies cannot produce\r\nintellectual and moral effects in living human beings, especially when\r\nthe engraved gems are, as is usual, hidden away somewhere, or buried\r\nunderground.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Astrology and religion and history.]\r\n\r\nWilliam condemns as error the association of the world’s leading\r\nreligions with the planets, as Judaism with Saturn, Islam with\r\nVenus, and Christianity with the sun.[1250] The stars, he declares,\r\nare subject to religion, not religion to the stars, and Joshua made\r\neven the sun and moon stand still. William is candid enough to\r\nrecognize that the seven-branched candlestick in the Jewish tabernacle\r\ndesignated the seven planets, but elsewhere states that the Mosaic\r\nLaw forbade observation of the stars.[1251] William also considers\r\nthe doctrine of the _magnus annus_ or Platonic year, that after\r\n36,000 solar years history will repeat itself down to the minutest\r\ndetail owing to the recurrence of the former series of positions of\r\nthe constellations.[1252] Since this has the support of men of great\r\nreputation, he lists various arguments advanced in its favor and rebuts\r\nthem in detail.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Comets and the star of Bethlehem.]\r\n\r\nWilliam believes that comets appear in the sky and in the air “as signs\r\nof slaughters and other great events in the world.” He mentions “the\r\nuniversal belief” that they foretell the deaths of kings and political\r\nchanges.[1253] But he asserts that the star announcing Christ’s\r\nbirth was not of this sort and that the darkness at the time of the\r\nCrucifixion was not due to an ordinary eclipse.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1102] _Gulielmi Alverni episcopi Parisiensis mathematici perfectissimi\r\neximii philosophi ac theologi praestantissimi Opera omnia per\r\nJoannem Dominicum Traianum Neapolitanum Venetiis ex officina Damiani\r\nZenari_, 1591. The _De universo_ occupies nearly half of the volume,\r\npp. 561-1012. My references will be to this edition and to the _De\r\nuniverso_ unless some other title is specified. In it--and in such\r\nother editions of William’s works as I have seen--the chapter headings\r\nare often very poor guides to the contents, especially if the chapter\r\nis of any length. There are at Paris thirteenth century MSS of the _De\r\nfide_ and _De legibus_ (BN 15755) and _De universo_ (BN 15756).\r\n\r\nThe chief secondary work on William of Auvergne is Noel Valois,\r\n_Guillaume d’Auvergne_, Paris, 1880. One chapter is devoted to his\r\nattitude to the superstitions of his age, and goes to the other extreme\r\nfrom Daunou, HL XVIII, 375, whom Valois criticizes for calling William\r\nextremely credulous. The inadequacy of Valois’ chapter, at least from\r\nour standpoint, may be inferred from his total omission of William’s\r\nconception of “natural magic.” Valois has no treatment of William’s\r\nattitude to natural science but contents himself with a discussion\r\nof his philosophy and psychology. (See also M. Baumgartner, _Die\r\nErkenntnislehre des Wilhelm von Auvergne_, Münster, 1893.) The chapter\r\non William’s attitude to superstition is largely given over to examples\r\nof popular superstitions in the thirteenth century, supplementing\r\nlegends of Brittany and other stories told by William with similar\r\nanecdotes from the pages of Stephen of Bourbon, Caesar of Heisterbach,\r\nand Gervaise of Tilbury. Valois’ citations of William’s works are from\r\nan edition in which the pages were numbered differently from those in\r\nthe one I used.\r\n\r\n[1103] Valois (1880), pp. 9-11.\r\n\r\n[1104] Valois (1880), p. 53.\r\n\r\n[1105] HL 18, 357.\r\n\r\n[1106] II-iii-20, (pp. 994-95). Yet in another connection (I-i-46, pp.\r\n625-26) William inconsistently makes the assertion that everything\r\ndepends absolutely upon God’s will alone as an argument against\r\nemploying magic images to gain one’s ends. He tells a story of a man\r\nwho, when a magician offered to secure him some great dignity in\r\nhis city, asked him if he could get it against God’s will. When the\r\nmagician admitted that he could not, the man asked if he could prevent\r\nsecuring it if God willed it and the magician again answered “No.” The\r\nman then said that he would commit it all to God. William does not seem\r\nto see that this attitude is the same as that of ignorant persons who\r\nleave scientific investigation to God or of hungry people who expect\r\nGod to feed them.\r\n\r\n[1107] I-i-44, (p. 613).\r\n\r\n[1108] I-i-42, (p. 608).\r\n\r\n[1109] _Ibid._, (p. 606).\r\n\r\n[1110] See I-iii-31, (p. 759).

Some\r\n Manuscripts of the Treatise of Thetel on Seals.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _De natura rerum_; Date, authorship, and relation to similar\r\nworks.]\r\n\r\nWe now approach the consideration of two works with titles similar\r\nto Alexander Neckam’s _On the Natures of Things_, namely, Thomas\r\nof Cantimpré’s _On the Nature of Things_[1254] and Bartholomew of\r\nEngland’s _On the Properties of Things_. These two works are much\r\nlonger and more elaborate than Neckam’s, containing each nineteen\r\nbooks, whereas of his five books only two really dealt with the natures\r\nof things, and they lead up to the later and still better known natural\r\nencyclopedia of Vincent of Beauvais. Thomas and Bartholomew were\r\ncontemporaries and it is difficult to say whose book was finished or\r\nappeared first but we shall consider Thomas first. As he says that he\r\nspent fourteen or fifteen years in collecting his material, he perhaps\r\nbegan to write first and his work seems to reflect a somewhat less\r\ndeveloped state of learning. Thomas is later than Michael Scot whom he\r\ncites, while an allusion to Jacques de Vitry as the most recent of his\r\nauthorities and as now bishop of Tusculum and a cardinal indicates that\r\nthe work was finished between 1228 and 1244. On the whole Thomas and\r\nBartholomew seem to have compiled their works independently, employing\r\ndifferent general plans, emphasizing rather different fields, and using\r\nsomewhat different authorities. Possibly, therefore, the two works may\r\nhave been completed almost simultaneously, and one wonders whether\r\nthey may not have represented rival ventures of the two friar orders.\r\nBormans and Rose[1255] after him have dwelt on the use made of Thomas’s\r\ncompilation by his fellow Dominicans, Vincent of Beauvais and Albertus\r\nMagnus, but I have little doubt that most of his sources were known to\r\nthem directly. The _De natura rerum_ remained long in use; an official\r\nprice was fixed for it at the University of Paris in the reign of\r\nPhilip the Fair;[1256] and the manuscripts of it are numerous and\r\nwidespread, but as yet often unidentified because in the manuscripts\r\nthemselves it is either anonymous or ascribed to Albertus Magnus.[1257]\r\nThis attribution to Albert is found even in a manuscript of the\r\nthirteenth century, while “Albert in the book _De naturis rerum_,” is\r\ncited in the _Thesaurus pauperum_[1258] by Petrus Hispanus, a work\r\nwritten at some time before 1277 when its author died as Pope John XXI.\r\nBut Thomas himself speaks in the _Bonum universale de apibus_[1259] of\r\nthe _De natura rerum_ as an earlier work of his, which seems decisive,\r\nand he is also credited with the authorship of both these works in the\r\nfourteenth century Dominican bibliography. A critical edition of the\r\n_De natura rerum_ would be a valuable contribution to the study of\r\nmedieval learning.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Life of Thomas.]\r\n\r\nThe date of the birth of Thomas in Brabant has not been fixed but\r\nseems to lie between the years 1186 and 1210 and probably is close to\r\nthe latter date. He attended the episcopal school at Liège for eleven\r\nyears and entered the Dominican order in 1232. He states that he was in\r\nParis in 1238 when William of Auvergne as bishop of that city called a\r\nmeeting of all the masters in the chapter house of the Friars Preachers\r\nto consider the abuse of plurality of benefices.[1260] In 1246 he\r\nbecame subprior and lector of the Dominicans at Louvain. Kaufmann\r\nplaced the date of his death between 1263 and 1293, but if the date\r\n1276 mentioned in his _Bonum universale de apibus_ is correct,[1261]\r\nhe was alive then. In that work he seems to refer to Aquinas and\r\nAlbertus Magnus as both still living,[1262] but the former had already\r\ncompleted his studies with Albert and become a professor of theology\r\nhimself,[1263] while Albert is spoken of as if an old man.[1264] Thomas\r\nsays that he was an attendant upon his lectures “for a long while” when\r\nhe occupied the chair of theology. It does not seem, however, that this\r\npassage implies any very close relation of discipleship between Thomas\r\nand Albert.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Character of the _De natura rerum_.]\r\n\r\nThe _De natura rerum_ is professedly a handy compilation made from\r\nnumerous other writings, as Thomas states both in his preface and\r\nconclusion. Stimulated by the remark in Augustine’s _Christian\r\nDoctrine_ that it would be a splendid achievement if someone should\r\ncollect in one volume data concerning the natures of things and\r\nespecially of animals, Thomas has spared neither labor, solicitude,\r\nnor expense toward that end and has spent fourteen or fifteen years in\r\ncollecting material “scattered widely over the world in the diverse\r\nwritings” of many philosophers and authors. He has not been satisfied\r\nto pursue his investigations merely in Gaul and Germany, although books\r\nabound in those countries, but has gone beyond the sea and collected\r\nthe books published in England on nature, and has made excerpts from\r\nall sources. He asks indulgence of his readers if he has omitted\r\nanything that should be included, reminding them how great a task it\r\nis for one man to read and digest all the varied and scattered works\r\nof the philosophers. Nevertheless he feels that “there will scarcely\r\nbe found among the Latins so much and so varied material compressed\r\ninto a single volume.”[1265] Thomas does not directly state as his\r\naim, although it is perhaps involved in his citation of Augustine, the\r\nelucidation of the properties of things mentioned in the Bible, as we\r\nshall find that Bartholomew of England does. But he expresses a hope\r\nthat arguments for the Faith and illustrations serviceable in sermons\r\nmay be derived from his work, and there are a number of little books\r\nin existence in manuscript which seem to be extracts from the works\r\nof Thomas or Bartholomew intended for pulpit use.[1266] Thomas will\r\nsometimes, moreover, like Alexander Neckam, explain the allegorical or\r\nmoral significance of natural phenomena, “but not continually, because\r\nwe have tried to avoid prolixity.” As a matter of fact, it is rarely\r\nthat he does so,[1267] although the amount of allegory or moralizing\r\nvaries somewhat in different manuscripts. These also differ as to the\r\nfulness of the text generally and there are numerous minor differences,\r\ncertain passages being abbreviated or entirely omitted in some\r\nmanuscripts. Copies have also been discovered of a second or revised\r\nedition in which a twentieth book has been added.[1268]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Plan and contents.]\r\n\r\nThe manuscripts also differ in their arrangement of the work, but as\r\nThomas supplies us with a table of contents, there can be no doubt as\r\nto the original and correct order. He begins with the parts of the\r\nhuman body, devoting a chapter to each member, its ills and their cure,\r\nand having considerable to say on the subject of obstetrics. His second\r\nbook discusses the soul (_anima_). The brief third book treats of\r\nstrange and monstrous races of men who are found chiefly in the orient\r\nbut in some cases elsewhere, hermaphrodites, for instance, in France.\r\nThen come successive books on quadrupeds, birds, marine monsters, fish,\r\nserpents, and worms. These six books devoted to animal life other than\r\nman occupy considerably more than half of the entire work. Thomas turns\r\nnext to the vegetable kingdom, devoting two books to trees, of which\r\nthe second deals with aromatic and medicinal trees, and one book to\r\nherbs. After the brief thirteenth book on fountains and other bodies of\r\nwater he comes to (14) precious stones, (15) the seven metals, (16) the\r\nseven regions of air, (17) the sphere and planets, (18) meteorology,\r\nand finally to the universe and four elements. These two topics of\r\nhis nineteenth book are usually discussed near the start of medieval\r\nscientific treatises, and the reason for the order adopted by Thomas is\r\nnot very evident, unless perhaps he at first intended to write about\r\nanimals alone and then added further books on other subjects, or unless\r\nhe decided to begin with man the microcosm and end with the _mundus_\r\nor macrocosm. If such was his plan, he does not seem to say so, and it\r\nis hardly surprising that liberties were taken with his order in some\r\nof the manuscripts, which begin with book sixteen and end with book\r\nfifteen, apparently in order to start with the heavens and elements and\r\nthen consider the particular creatures of inferior creation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Chief authorities.]\r\n\r\nAs the work of Thomas is professedly a compilation, it is important\r\nto note his authorities. At the start he mentions those to whom he\r\nis most indebted: first, Aristotle, and then Pliny. Third comes the\r\n_De mirabilibus_ (instead of _memorabilibus_) _mundi_ of Solinus whom\r\nThomas esteems both as a man of marvelous eloquence and as a diligent\r\nscrutinizer of the natures of things. Very different this from Albertus\r\nMagnus’ sceptical estimate of Solinus as a philosopher who told many\r\nlies, and yet there are modern scholars who contend that Albert took\r\nmuch of his natural science ready-made and without acknowledgment\r\nfrom the _De natura rerum_ of his pupil[1269] Thomas. It will be\r\nnoted that Thomas names his chief authorities in chronological order.\r\nFourth comes Ambrose, to whose eloquent description of birds and\r\nbeasts in the _Hexaemeron_ Thomas finds it necessary, however, to make\r\nadditions; and fifth, Isidore. Sixth, and most recent in time, is the\r\n_Oriental History_ of Jacques de Vitry to whom Thomas “was intimately\r\ndevoted.”[1270] Jacques had occupied several chapters of his _Oriental\r\nHistory_[1271] with the fountains, trees and herbs, animals, serpents,\r\nbirds, and rare fish, precious stones and strange races of the orient,\r\nand had then added a briefer list to show that the west, too, was not\r\nwithout its marvels. Thomas also mentions two anonymous works, which\r\nhe appears to cite chiefly concerning animals[1272] and whose titles\r\nhe gives as _Experimentator_ and _Liber rerum_. Thomas was probably\r\ncorrect in his surmise that _Experimentator_ had been compiled in\r\nrecent times and we shall meet citations of it in other authors of the\r\nthirteenth century. But the original texts of the _Liber rerum_ and\r\n_Experimentator_ do not seem to have survived.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Embodiment of long extracts.]\r\n\r\nThomas mentions yet other authorities in his preface and even more\r\nin the course of his work. His method in using his sources varies.\r\nSometimes he combines in one paragraph brief statements from a\r\nnumber of authorities bearing on the same topic. Again he may insert\r\npractically _verbatim_ a long extract or complete treatment of a matter\r\nby some one author, or even an entire treatise such as the _Letter of\r\nAlexander to Aristotle_ or Thetel’s discussion of seals in stones. Thus\r\nin his first book on the human body he uses a work supposed to have\r\nbeen written by Cleopatra to her daughter on the subject of gynecology,\r\nand inserts in condensed form John of Spain’s translation from the\r\nArabic of the medical portion of _The Secret of Secrets_ supposed\r\nto have been written by Aristotle to Alexander. His second book on\r\nthe soul follows Augustine’s treatise _De anima_. His third book on\r\nstrange and monstrous races of men includes also some account of the\r\nGymnosophists and Brahmans and their verbal repartee or epistolary\r\ncorrespondence with Alexander of Macedon.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Other citations.]\r\n\r\nWith some of the authors whom he names Thomas was almost surely not\r\ndirectly acquainted. Dorotheus the Athenian, Menander, and Mago, for\r\ninstance, he mentions as “authorities according to Pliny.” He does\r\nnot seem to make as much use of Galen as might be expected, were\r\nthat author’s works already accessible in Latin translation; but he\r\nprobably had the old Latin version of Alexander Tralles, to whom he\r\nprobably refers as “_Alexander medicus_.” He probably also had seen\r\nBasil’s _Hexaemeron_ in Latin translation, since he cites it as well\r\nas Ambrose a number of times, and also in the preface to his _Bonum\r\nuniversale de apibus_ lists “the great Basil” together with Aristotle,\r\nSolinus, Pliny, Ambrose, and Jacques de Vitry as his authorities in the\r\ndiscussion of bees in the _De natura rerum_. Many other writers he has\r\nwithout much doubt read for himself: Boethius, Martianus Capella, and\r\nRabanus of earlier medieval Latin writers; Platearius and Constantinus\r\nAfricanus in medicine; Aldhelme[1273] and _Physiologus_ on animals;\r\nof the Arabs Alfraganus, Albumasar, and perhaps Averroës. Michael\r\nScot seems to be cited in some manuscripts and not in others.[1274]\r\nIn treating of stones Thomas does not cite Marbod by name but states\r\nthat he is using the metrical version of the account which Evax, king\r\nof Arabia, is said to have written for the emperor Nero. Thomas,\r\nhowever, adds statements from other authors on stones. Like Alexander\r\nNeckam Thomas seems to use the _Natural Questions_ of Adelard of Bath\r\nwithout acknowledgment. In discussing herbs he asks the three opening\r\nquestions of Adelard’s treatise and proceeds to solve them in words\r\nwhich are often identical. After this general introduction his chapters\r\non particular herbs are almost invariably introduced by the formula,\r\n“As Platearius says.” Ferckel has pointed out that the greater part of\r\nthree chapters in his first book on human anatomy is drawn from the\r\n_Philosophia_ of William of Conches,[1275] and that the twentieth book,\r\nadded in some manuscripts, is taken from the same work. Thus Thomas\r\nmakes much use of comparatively recent authorities. He also tells us\r\nthat he has not disdained to include some popular beliefs.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Credulous attitude.]\r\n\r\nThomas of Cantimpré must be reckoned as one of the most credulous\r\nof our authors. In his books on animals he seems of the uncritical\r\nschool of the marvelous of Solinus, Basil, Ambrose, the _Physiologus_,\r\nand Jacques de Vitry. Seldom does he question any statement that he\r\nfinds in his authorities; indeed, he does not appear to possess the\r\nindependent knowledge of animal life to enable him to do so. He does\r\nstate that the power of the little _echinus_ to stop ships has seemed\r\nincredible to many, but inasmuch as Ambrose, Jacques, Aristotle,\r\nIsidore, and Basil all assert it confidently, he does not see how\r\nthere is any room left for doubt.[1276] The story of the beaver’s\r\nself-castration in order to escape its hunters is given without\r\ncomment, and we are further told that the animal cannot live unless it\r\nkeeps its tail in the water.[1277] Thomas tells us that Isidore held\r\nthat the Sirens were really harlots who enticed men to moral ruin,\r\nbut he adds that the more general opinion is that they are irrational\r\nmarine monsters who still exist and he cites “those who testify that\r\nthey have seen the Sirens themselves.” Their song is more like that of\r\nbirds than it is like articulate speech. Sometimes, on the other hand,\r\nThomas prefers a miraculous or supernatural to a natural explanation\r\nof a marvelous statement. He is not sure whether the onocentaur seen\r\nby St. Anthony in the desert was real or a deception of the devil,\r\nand he regards as not natural but a divine miracle the story that\r\nthe Apostle Peter had shut up in a mountain near Rome a dragon which\r\nwill live until the end of the world. He adds, however, the tale of\r\nthe two dragons found alive under the tower from the _History of the\r\nBritons_. About all that can be said for Thomas on this score is that\r\nhe does not appear to add many new marvels of his own to the incredible\r\nassertions of past writers.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Very uncritical character of the _Bonum universale de\r\napibus_.]\r\n\r\nThomas’s credulity seems to have increased with age, since his later\r\n_Bonum universale de apibus_,[1278] in which bees are a mere starting\r\npoint for a disquisition on the qualities which bishops and other\r\nclergy should possess and the introduction of innumerable anecdotes, is\r\na tissue of monkish tales and gossip, instances of special providence,\r\napparitions of the dead and of demons, and other miracles and\r\nmoralities, most of which are supposed to have occurred in Thomas’s own\r\ntime and are recounted upon hearsay. Thus we read of a son who did not\r\nadequately support his aged father and was punished by a toad leaping\r\nonto his face and taking such a hold that it could not be removed but\r\nremained as a disfiguring growth. As a penance the son was sent by his\r\nbishop through the diocese as an example and warning to others. Or\r\nThomas assures us that Albertus Magnus told him that at Paris the demon\r\nappeared to him in the form of a fellow friar in an effort to call him\r\naway from his studies, but departed by virtue of the sign of the cross.\r\nIn short, the work is on the same order as the _Dialogues_ of Gregory\r\nthe Great.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A chapter on the lion.]\r\n\r\nThomas’s treatment of animals in general and quadrupeds in particular\r\ncan perhaps best be illustrated by a paraphrase of some one chapter\r\nentire, for which purpose I have selected that on the lion. It will be\r\nnoted that there is no apparent logic in the order of the statements\r\nwhich I have had to divide into paragraphs rather arbitrarily. It\r\nhas seemed fairer, however, to reproduce the order unchanged than to\r\nbring together scattered statements bearing on the same point. Many\r\nof Thomas’s statements are found also in Aristotle’s _History of\r\nAnimals_,[1279] although Thomas’s citations would indicate that some\r\nitems, at least, were derived by him from that source only indirectly.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Different kinds of lions: their generation.]\r\n\r\nThe lion, as Jacques and Solinus state, is called the king of animals.\r\nThere are three kinds of lions. Many are short and have curly manes\r\nbut are weak and cowardly. Those generated by pards are ignoble and\r\ndegenerate and have no manes. The larger ones with ordinary manes are\r\nnoble and keen and without guile or suspicion. The lion’s brow and tail\r\nreveal his intentions. His virtue resides in his breast and forefoot\r\nand tail.[1280] And he is stout-hearted.[1281] He is so hot of nature\r\nthat he is said to have sexual intercourse at all times.[1282] The\r\nlioness bears first five, then four, then three, then two cubs, then\r\nonly one, after which she becomes sterile.[1283] Aristotle accounts\r\nfor this by the great heat attending the generation of lions who have\r\nsolider and stronger bodies for their size than other animals. The\r\nlioness has only two tits and not corresponding in size to her body.\r\nThis is not because she has so few cubs but because she eats only flesh\r\nwhich does not readily turn into milk.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Disposition and behavior.]\r\n\r\nSolinus says that the lion is not easily enraged, but when anyone does\r\nprovoke him he shows no mercy to his adversary. On the other hand, he\r\nspares the prostrate captive and allows those whom he meets by chance\r\nto proceed on their way.[1284] He is fiercer to men than to women,\r\nand to women who have had intercourse with men than to virgins and\r\nchildren. Adelinus says that he sleeps with his eyes open. Pliny says\r\nthat as he walks he obliterates his tracks with his tail in order\r\nto foil his hunters. Lions do not fight among themselves.[1285]\r\nSolinus[1286] says that if hunted in the open, the lion will wait\r\nfor the dogs and dissimulate his fear, but in the woods, where no\r\none can see his cowardice, will take to his heels. When pursuing his\r\nprey he leaps into the air in order to see farther, but not when he\r\nis fleeing. Aristotle states that the lion and Arabian camel are the\r\nonly quadrupeds to move the right foot first. In making water the lion\r\nlifts his foot like a dog. When the lion opens his mouth a strong odor\r\nexudes. “The lion, very swift by fortitude, is somewhat heavy of nature\r\nbecause of its slow digestion.” When running, it cannot come to a stop\r\nthe instant it wishes.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fear inspired and felt by lions.]\r\n\r\nWhen about to drink, the lion draws a wide circle with its tail and\r\nroars so that the other animals dare not cross this line.[1287] Ambrose\r\ntells a marvel to the effect that many animals which are swift enough\r\nto evade the lion’s onset are paralyzed by the sound of its roar. As\r\nking of beasts the lion scorns the society of the other animals and\r\nwill not touch meat which is a day old.[1288] But it fears a scorpion.\r\nAccording to the _Liber rerum_, some say that the lion is consumed\r\ninternally by its own fury and fiery blood, even when it does not have\r\nthe appearance of being angry. Solinus says that a lion in captivity\r\nfears the sound of wheels but dreads a fire still more. Jacques says\r\nthat it is also afraid of a white cock. Pliny says that a captive lion\r\ncan be tamed by seeing its cub whipped or by watching a dog obey a man.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Their diet, medicine, and mode of fighting.]\r\n\r\nLions are never found overladen with fat. They take food or drink on\r\nalternate days, and fast if their digestion fails to operate. If they\r\ndevour too much flesh, they put their claws into their mouths and\r\nextract it. The lion has a natural enmity for the wild ass. A sick\r\nlion eats an ape, as Ambrose says, or drains a dog’s blood. Pliny tells\r\nof a Syracusan whom a lion persistently followed until he extracted a\r\nsplinter from its foot. Another lion insisted on having a bone removed\r\nfrom its teeth. Some manuscripts[1289] here insert from Pliny and\r\nSolinus the tale of the wiles of the lioness to conceal her amours with\r\nthe pard, and the assertion that a lion wags its tail only when in good\r\nhumor. When a lion begins to move it beats the ground with its tail but\r\nas it increases its speed lashes its back. When wounded it always takes\r\nnote of the man who inflicted the wound and goes for him. If a man has\r\nhurled missiles at it but failed to hit it, the lion merely knocks him\r\ndown. Philosopher says that when fighting for its cubs the lion keeps\r\nits gaze fixed on the ground so as not to be terrified by the spears of\r\nthe hunters.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Medical virtues of the lion’s carcass.]\r\n\r\nPliny recommends eating the flesh and heart of a lion to persons\r\nafflicted with colds. The lion’s bones are so hard that they\r\nstrike fire like flint. The hollow in its bones is very small and\r\nrarely contains any marrow, and then only in the hip bones, as\r\nExperimenter[1290] says. Lion’s fat is an antidote for poisons, and a\r\nman anointed with it and wine puts to flight all beasts and snakes.\r\nIt is hotter than the fat of any other quadruped. The lion is almost\r\nalways feverish, and that with quartan fever. The effect of its roar\r\nupon other beasts is again mentioned. When crossing hard or stony\r\nground the lion spares its claws since they are its weapons. Pliny\r\nasserts that lion fat with oil of roses keeps the face white and free\r\nfrom blotches. The neck bone of the lion is continuous and the flesh\r\nthere cartilaginous like a muscle, so that it cannot turn its neck, a\r\ndisability which some, the _Liber rerum_ states, ascribe incorrectly to\r\nindignation or stolidity on the lion’s part. Aristotle says that the\r\ninternal organs and teeth of a lion are like those of a dog.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Medieval and modern encyclopedias compared.]\r\n\r\nAfter this account in the _De natura rerum_ the article on the lion\r\nin the latest edition of the _Encyclopedia Britannica_ will be found\r\nrather dull reading and scanty as concerns the behavior of lions as\r\nwell as the medicinal properties of their carcasses. Almost all of\r\nantiquity’s interesting assertions concerning lions are omitted, no\r\ndoubt as false, but little of interest is supplied in their place. We\r\nare told a number of things that the lion will not do: he will not\r\nclimb, he will not take more than three bounds after his prey. But even\r\nThomas does not say that a lion ever climbs; the notion does not seem\r\neven to have occurred to him.[1291] Nor does Thomas assert that all\r\nlions are brave or noble or magnanimous. On the whole, the lion does\r\nnot seem a subject upon which modern science has added vastly to our\r\nknowledge. There were far more lions in existence in antiquity, and men\r\nwere more interested in them then, and thought at least that they knew\r\nmore about them.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Examples of the zoology of the Experimenter.]\r\n\r\nSome notion of the work ascribed by Thomas to _Experimentator_ may\r\nbe gained from Thomas’s citations of it in his chapter on the wolf.\r\nExperimenter explains the fact stated by Ambrose, that a man who is\r\nseen first by a wolf cannot speak, by arguing that the rays from the\r\nwolf’s eyes dry up the _spiritus_ of human vision which in its turn\r\ndries up the human _spiritus_ generally. Thereby the wind-pipes are\r\ndried up and in consequence the throat so that man cannot speak.\r\nExperimenter states further that the wolf collects willow leaves in his\r\nmouth and makes a pile of them under which he hides in order to catch\r\ngoats. And when walking over dry leaves he licks his paws so that the\r\ndogs will not hear him. An insulting reflection upon the canine sense\r\nof smell!\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fish, worms, and toads.]\r\n\r\nWe will pass over Thomas’s books on birds, marine monsters, fish,\r\nand serpents, except to note in passing that Delisle credited him\r\nwith supplying some new information concerning the medieval herring\r\nfisheries,[1292] and come to his separate treatment of “worms.”\r\nThose with only two or four feet have a little blood, but those with\r\nmore feet than four are bloodless, because the blood is exhausted in\r\nproviding nutrition for so many feet and because the motion of so\r\nmany feet annihilates the blood. Many worms begin and end their life\r\nin the course of a summer, since they are born rather from corruption\r\nthan from seed. Earthworms in particular are generated from pure and\r\nunadulterated earth with no admixture of _semen_, and so furnish\r\nillustration and proof of the virgin birth of Christ. In the opinion\r\nof the _Liber rerum_ the toad is a worm. It is venomous and has a\r\npestilential glance. It feeds on earth, eating as much as it can clutch\r\nin its forefoot, in which it is emblematic of avarice and cupidity. In\r\nGaul there are big toads or frogs with a voice like a horn, but they\r\nlose their voice if taken outside of that country, typifying clergymen\r\nwho like Jonah will not preach outside of their own land. Some\r\nmanuscripts add from “Alexander”[1293] that toads are fond of the plant\r\nsalvia and that it is sometimes poisoned by contact with them. Hence it\r\nis advised to touch a patch of salvia with rue, the dew from which is\r\ndeadly to toads. A stone found in the head of a toad, if worn by a man,\r\nis an amulet against poison. Several toads can be generated from the\r\nashes of a toad.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Solomon’s experiment in worms.]\r\n\r\nIn planning to build a temple of fine marbles Solomon found\r\nembarrassing the prohibition in the Mosaic law forbidding one to cut\r\nstones for the altar of the Lord with iron. But then he sought by\r\nan experiment in worms what the art of man knew not. He shut up the\r\nfledglings of an ostrich in a glass vase, so that the mother bird could\r\nsee them but could not get at them to feed them. The ostrich thereupon\r\nflew (?) off to the desert and came back with a worm. It then broke the\r\nglass vase by smearing it with the blood of this worm. Solomon found\r\nthis worm, called _Thamur_ or the worm of Solomon, equally efficacious\r\nin cutting marble.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Trees.]\r\n\r\nIn speaking of trees most manuscripts[1294] tell of an oak under which\r\nAbraham dwelt and which lasted until Constantine’s time. The trees in\r\nthe Garden of Eden or terrestrial paradise are also discussed, though\r\nof course no longer accessible. Josephus is cited concerning trees\r\nnear the Red Sea and apples of Sodom. Thomas thinks that the Sun-tree\r\nand Moon-tree mentioned in Alexander’s letter to Aristotle had been\r\nreferred to much earlier in the benediction of Joseph in _Deuteronomy_.\r\nAs for the responses which these trees are said to have given\r\nAlexander, Thomas has little doubt that this was the work of demons,\r\nalthough some contend that it was done by divine permission through\r\nministering angels.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Marvelous virtues of stones.]\r\n\r\nLike Marbod, Thomas points out that, while plants and fruits receive\r\ntheir virtues “through the medium of the operations of nature,” no\r\nexcess of cold or heat can be observed in stones to account for\r\ntheir miraculous powers, such as conferring invisibility, and that\r\nconsequently their virtues must come direct from God. He alludes to\r\nthe belief that Solomon imprisoned demons beneath the gems in rings,\r\nand cites the fifteenth book of _The City of God_ for the statement\r\nthat demons are attracted by various stones, herbs, woods, animals, and\r\nincantations.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: An adamantine mariner’s compass.]\r\n\r\nWhile Thomas’s exposition of the virtues of gems is largely based upon\r\nMarbod, in discussing _adamas_ or adamant he introduces a description\r\nof the mariner’s compass, concerning which Marbod is silent and which\r\nhad probably not been invented or introduced in western Europe that\r\nearly, although Neckam of course alludes to it before Thomas. After\r\nspeaking of a variety of adamant which can be broken without resort to\r\ngoat’s blood but which will attract iron even away from the magnet,\r\nThomas adds that it also betrays the location of the star of the sea\r\nwhich is called _Maria_. When sailors cannot direct their course to\r\nport amid obscure mists, they take a needle and, after rubbing its\r\npoint on adamant, fasten it transversely on a small stick or straw\r\nand place it in a vessel full of water. Then by carrying some adamant\r\naround the vessel they start the needle rotating. Then the stone is\r\nsuddenly withdrawn and presently the point of the needle comes to rest\r\npointing towards the star in question.[1295]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The mariner’s compass and magic.]\r\n\r\nHaving concluded this description of a mariner’s compass, Thomas again\r\nfollows the poem of Marbod and goes on to say that the adamant is also\r\nsaid to be potent in magic arts, to make its bearer brave against the\r\nenemy, to repel vain dreams and poison, and to benefit lunatics and\r\ndemoniacs. I mention this accidental juxtaposition of the mariner’s\r\ncompass and magic because, as we shall find in the case of Roger Bacon,\r\nit has often been stated that those in possession of the secret of\r\nthe mariner’s compass were long afraid to reveal it for fear of being\r\nsuspected of magic, or that sailors were at first afraid to employ the\r\nnew device for the same reason. This passage in the _De natura rerum_\r\nis as far as I know the only one in the sources that might even seem\r\nto suggest such a connection, but Thomas does not really connect the\r\ncompass and magic at all. Later in the same book, in discussing the\r\nmagnet, he says nothing of the compass, although repeating the usual\r\nstatements that the magnet attracts iron, is used in magic, and has the\r\noccult property of revealing an unchaste wife.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Occult virtues of sculptured gems.]\r\n\r\nAfter completing his account of the occult virtues of gems in their\r\nnatural state, Thomas goes on to discuss the sculpture of gems and\r\nthe additional virtues which they thereby acquire, a subject on which\r\nMarbod had not touched. Thomas had already announced at the beginning\r\nof his book on stones:[1296] “Moreover, at the close of this book we\r\nhave given certain opinions of the ancients which we think are neither\r\nto be credited in every respect nor denied in every respect, and in\r\nthis we follow the glorious Augustine. The children of Israel are said\r\nto have carved certain gems in the desert, especially carnelians, and\r\ntheir work of sculpture is said to have been of such subtle skill that\r\nno one since has ever dared attempt an imitation of it. And there is\r\nno doubt but that figures and images of figures are engraved according\r\nto the efficacies of the virtues of gems.” Thomas also admits that\r\nthe Israelites should have been adepts in such work, when he recalls\r\nthe divine direction which they received in the case of the twelve\r\ngems in the breast-plate of the high priest. “Therefore it is evident\r\nthat sculptures are not found on gems without good reason. On the\r\nother hand, I would not say that every such engraving is a token of\r\nmystic virtue.” Later, when he comes to “the relations of the ancient\r\nsculptors concerning the engraving of gems,” Thomas warns that,\r\nalthough the form of stones is to be honored for its virtue, “yet hope\r\nis not to be put in them but, according to what is written, in God\r\nalone from whom is derived the virtue of stones and the dignity of\r\nevery creature.” The astrological character of such engraved images is\r\nmade manifest by the connection of many of them with the signs of the\r\nzodiac.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Thetel on images on stones.]\r\n\r\nThomas complains that the ancient authorities for such images and their\r\nvirtues are often not cited, but he had found a treatise in which the\r\nimages which the children of Israel were supposed to have engraved\r\nin the desert were recorded by a Jewish philosopher named Thetel or\r\nTechel.[1297] Of this treatise Thomas makes a Latin translation for\r\nhis readers, cautioning them, however, that Thetel’s opinions “are not\r\nto be trusted on every point.” Thetel’s treatise, at least as it is\r\nreproduced by Thomas who, however, has perhaps already used parts of it\r\nin his preceding discussion, begins with the sentence: “When a jasper\r\nis found and on it a man with a shield about his neck or in his hand\r\nand a serpent beneath his feet, this has virtue against all enemies.”\r\nIt ends with the sentence: “When there is found on a stone a foaming\r\nhorse and above a man holding a scepter in his hand, this is good for\r\nthose who have power over men.” These sentences perhaps sufficiently\r\nsuggest the character of the work. It is also found separately in the\r\nmanuscripts as early as the twelfth century.[1298] Some of these vary\r\nconsiderably from the text as given by Thomas. The popularity of the\r\ntreatise is also attested by the allusions in its prefaces to spurious\r\nimitations of it.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Zahel or Zaël the Israelite.]\r\n\r\nThis Thetel, Techel, or Cehel, with his seals of the children of\r\nIsrael, is presumably no other than Zethel or Zachel or Zahel or Zaël,\r\nthe Israelite or Ismaelite,[1299] some of whose astrological treatises\r\nappeared in early printed editions,[1300] and several of whose works\r\nare listed by Albertus Magnus in the _Speculum astronomiae_.[1301]\r\nThis Sahl ben Bisr ben Habib lived until 823 with the governor of\r\nChorasan and then became the astrologer of El-Hasan, vizier to the\r\nCaliph al-Mamun. He was highly esteemed by the Byzantines, who called\r\nhim Σέχελ or τοῦ σοφωτάτου Ἰουδαίου τοῦ Σὰχλ τοῦ υἱοῦ τοῦ Πέσρ.[1302]\r\nThe translation of his works into Latin seems to have begun at an early\r\ndate, as his _Fatidica_ or _Decrees of Fate_ was translated in 1138 by\r\nHermann of Dalmatia,[1303] while our treatise on seals appears in a\r\ntwelfth century manuscript.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Consecration of gems.]\r\n\r\nThomas terminates his book on stones by instructions, quite in the\r\ntone of the blessed Hildegard, concerning the blessing of gems. As a\r\nresult of Adam’s fall every creature was corrupted and lost some of its\r\noriginal virtue, and even such virtues as are left to gems are often\r\nfurther corrupted by the touch of impious and impure men. Hence, just\r\nas sinful men are renovated by baptism and penance, so gems can have\r\nsome of their lost virtues restored by a ceremony of consecration and\r\nsanctification. They should be wrapped in linen, placed on the altar,\r\nand the priest, after saying mass and while still wearing his sacred\r\nrobes, should offer this prayer:\r\n\r\n“God, almighty Father, who showed Thy virtue to all through certain\r\ninsensible creatures, who bade Thy servant Moses adorn himself\r\namong other holy vestments with twelve precious stones as a token\r\nof judgment, and also showed the Evangelist John the heavenly city\r\nof Jerusalem eternally constructed of the virtues which these same\r\nstones typify, we humbly beseech Thy Majesty to deign to consecrate\r\nand sanctify these stones by the sanctification and invocation of Thy\r\nName, that they may be sanctified and consecrated, and may recover the\r\nefficacious virtues with which the experience of wise men proves Thee\r\nto have endowed them, so that whatever persons may wear them, may feel\r\nThy virtue present through them and may deserve to receive the gifts of\r\nThy grace and the protection of Thy virtue, through Jesus, Thy Son, in\r\nwhom all sanctification consists, who lives with Thee, and reigns as\r\nGod through infinite successions of cycles.”[1304]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The seven metals: modern plumbing.]\r\n\r\nIn his book on the seven metals, namely, gold, electrum, silver,\r\ncopper, lead, tin, and iron, Thomas alludes to transmutation in\r\nspeaking of copper and cites a work of alchemy ascribed to Aristotle,\r\n_The Light of Lights (De lumine luminum)_, for the assertion that\r\nthe best gold is that made from a boy’s urine and brass. This\r\nstatement is to be understood, however, only of the color of the\r\ngold and not of the substance. In his discussion of lead, tin, and\r\niron Thomas cites no authorities except that once he remarks, “as\r\nthe philosopher says.”[1305] Perhaps therefore we have here what is\r\nlargely a contribution of his own. At any rate it seems to include the\r\nfirst mention of the invention of modern plumbing.[1306] Tin, Thomas\r\ntells us, rusts out easily if it lies long in water. Therefore the\r\nunderground pipes of aqueducts have long been made of lead, but they\r\nused to be joined with tin, but in “modern times” human art has thought\r\nout a method of uniting them with hot molten lead. For while tin will\r\nnot remain solid for long, “lead lasts forever underground.” Thomas\r\ngoes on to say that lead has the peculiar property among the metals\r\nof always increasing in size. Like Hildegard, he also mentions steel,\r\nwhich he says is hardened by many tensions so that it surpasses iron in\r\nvirtue. He further tells of an oriental iron[1307] which is very good\r\nfor cutting and is fusible like copper or silver but not ductile like\r\nthe iron in other parts of the world.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The seven regions of the air.]\r\n\r\nThe discussion in the _De natura rerum_ of the seven regions of the\r\nair and their humors, namely, dew, snow, hail, rain, “laudanum,”\r\nmanna and honey, reminds one of Michael Scot’s treatment of the same\r\nsubject,[1308] but seems to be drawn from a common source rather than\r\ndirectly copied from it. Thomas states that Aristotle has treated more\r\nfully of these humors in his _Meteorology_, but in reality Aristotle\r\nsays nothing of the last three named in the _Meteorology_, although in\r\nthe _History of Animals_ he says that honey is distilled from the air\r\nby the stars. Thomas draws the same distinction as Michael Scot had\r\nmade between natural honey and the artificial sort made by bees. He is\r\nwilling to grant that the manna upon which the children of Israel lived\r\nwas created in this region of the sky, although especially prepared for\r\nthem by a divine miracle.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Astrological.]\r\n\r\nThe astrological passages of the _De natura rerum_ are neither striking\r\nnor novel. In his books on animals Thomas had stated that various\r\nanimal substances such as the brains of wolves or the livers of mice\r\nvary in size with the waxing and waning of the moon. He denies that the\r\nplanets possess sense or that their movements are voluntary, but he\r\nquotes Pliny’s statement that by the influence of Venus all things on\r\nearth are generated, and states the influence of each planet when it is\r\nin the ascendant. Under Mars men become choleric and bellicose. Jupiter\r\nis such a source of safety and good health that Martianus declared that\r\nwere Jupiter the only planet, men would be immortal. Such, however,\r\nwas not the Creator’s will. The word “Jupiter” is not without reason\r\nderived from _iubens_ and _pater_, since during the ascension of this\r\nplanet all terrestrial things are born. For unless seeds were severed\r\nfrom their beginnings by some occult virtue, they would always remain\r\nimmovable in the state in which they were created. God accordingly put\r\nsuch power in the spheres of the stars and especially the planets that\r\ncreated things might obey his command to increase and multiply. They\r\nreturn, however, to the earth from which they came; the processes of\r\nnature are unceasingly repeated; and, as Solomon said, there is nothing\r\nnew under the sun. Thomas therefore reaches the usual conclusion that\r\nexcept for human free will and special manifestations of divine will,\r\nall nature is placed by God under the rule of the stars. The influence\r\nof sun and moon is manifest, and “why should we not with entire reason\r\nbelieve the same of the other planets?”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Elements and spirits.]\r\n\r\nThe nineteenth book opens with a discussion of the universe and\r\ncreation and closes with a discussion of the four elements. Fire has\r\neight effects expressed in the couplet:\r\n\r\n    _Destruit, emollit, restringit, consolidatque;_\r\n    _Clarificat, terret, accendit, letificatque._\r\n\r\nThomas illustrates each of these effects by a verse of Scripture. Fire\r\nalso has six properties, likewise expressed in a couplet:\r\n\r\n    _Mobilis et siccus mundusque favilla tenetur;_\r\n    _Crescit et accendit[1309] sed aqua modica removetur._\r\n\r\nConcerning these properties also Thomas quotes Scripture. He then\r\ntreats briefly of that purest fire which is above the seven regions of\r\nthe air. Demons dwell in the air “awaiting with torments the judgment\r\nday.”[1310] When they appear to men, they assume bodies from that\r\npart of the air which is densest and most mixed with the other three\r\nelements. But angels coming as messengers to mankind assume bodies in\r\nthe region of pure fire extending from the sphere of the moon to the\r\nfirmament.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Other works incorrectly ascribed to Thomas of Cantimpré.]\r\n\r\nIn the life of Albertus Magnus written by Peter of Prussia toward the\r\nend of the fifteenth century[1311] it is stated on the authority of\r\nthe chronicle of Brother Jacobus de Zuzato, master of theology, that\r\nThomas of Cantimpré translated word for word from Greek into Latin\r\n“all the books of Aristotle in rational, natural, and moral philosophy\r\nand metaphysics which we now use in the schools,[1312] and this at the\r\ninstance of Saint Thomas of Aquinas, for in Albert’s time all commonly\r\nused the old translation.”[1313] The task of translating Aristotle\r\nwas scarcely one for which Thomas of Cantimpré was qualified, and his\r\nname almost never appears in the extant manuscripts of translations of\r\nAristotle.[1314] Peter of Prussia and his source have probably confused\r\nWilliam of Moerbeke with Thomas of Cantimpré, as they both came from\r\nBrabant, and their names are juxtaposed in a fourteenth century list\r\nof writings by Dominicans, where, however, William is said to have\r\n“translated all the books of natural and moral philosophy from Greek\r\ninto Latin at the instance of brother Thomas.”[1315] Because of Thomas\r\nof Cantimpré’s chapters on gynecology, the _De secretis mulierum_\r\nusually ascribed to Albertus Magnus has sometimes been attributed to\r\nhim, but Ferckel denies this.[1316]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1254] Only extracts of the _De natura rerum_ have been printed (by J.\r\nB. Pitra, _Spicilegium Solesmense_, III, and in HL and _Ferckel_ as\r\nnoted below). Some discussion of the MSS and a partial list of them\r\nwill be found in Appendix I to this chapter. I have chiefly used MSS\r\nRoyal 12-E-XVII, 13th century; Royal 12-F-VI, 14th century; Egerton\r\n1984, 13th century, fols. 34-145; Arundel 323, 13th century, fols.\r\n1-98; and Arundel 164, 15th century, at the British Museum; and BN\r\n347B and 523A at Paris. As any topic to which a chapter is devoted\r\ncan be found without much difficulty in these MSS, which are divided\r\ninto books and chapters and equipped with tables of contents, I shall\r\nusually not take the time and space to make specific citations by folio\r\nin the ensuing chapter.\r\n\r\nOf Thomas’s _Bonum universale de apibus_ I have used the 1516 edition.\r\n\r\nSome books and articles on Thomas and his natural science are: Bormans,\r\n“Thomas de Cantimpré indiqué comme une des sources où Albert le\r\nGrand et surtout Maerlant ont puisé les matériaux de leur écrits sur\r\nl’histoire naturelle”; in _Bulletins de l’Acad. roy. des Sciences de\r\nBelgique_, XIX, 132-59, Brussels, 1852.\r\n\r\nCarus, _Geschichte der Zoologie_, Munich, 1872, pp. 211-33.\r\n\r\nHL 30 (1888) 365-84, Delisle, “La Nature des Choses, par Thomas de\r\nCantimpré,” supplementing and correcting the earlier account by Daunou\r\nin HL 19 (1838) 177-84, where the _De natura rerum_ had been called an\r\nanonymous work known only from Vincent of Beauvais’ citation of it.\r\n\r\nA. Kaufmann, _Thomas von Cantimpré_, Cologne, 1899, 137 pp., an\r\nunfinished work published posthumously without a projected section on\r\nThomas’s natural science, which the author had scarcely begun.\r\n\r\nStadler, “Albertus Magnus, Thomas von Cantimpré, und Vincent von\r\nBeauvais,” in _Natur und Kultur_, IV, 86-90, Munich, 1906.\r\n\r\nC. Ferckel, _Die Gynäkologie des Thomas von Brabant, ausgewählte\r\nKapitel aus Buch I de naturis rerum beendet um 1240_, Munich, 1912 (in\r\nG. Klein, _Alte Meister d. Medizin u. Naturkunde_).\r\n\r\n[1255] V. Rose (1875), pp. 335, 340.\r\n\r\n[1256] HL 30: 380.\r\n\r\n[1257] Sometimes the work concludes with the extraordinary _Explicit_,\r\n“the book of Lucius Annisius Seneca of Cordova, disciple of Fortinus\r\nthe Stoic, _De naturis rerum_,” as in Arundel 323.\r\n\r\n[1258] III, 16.\r\n\r\n[1259] In the preface.\r\n\r\n[1260] _Bonum universale de apibus_, I, 19, vii.\r\n\r\n[1261] _Ibid._, II, 57, lix. At I, 5, ii, 1252 is given as the date of\r\nthe “recent” murder of a Dominican by heretics at Verona; at II, 57,\r\niii, great winds and thunders are mentioned, which frightened men in\r\nGermany nearly out of their wits in 1256.\r\n\r\n[1262] Aquinas died in 1274, Albert in 1280.\r\n\r\n[1263] _Bonum universale de apibus_, I, 20, xi.\r\n\r\n[1264] _Ibid._, II, 57, li, “venerabilis ille frater ordinis\r\npredicatorum magister Albertus.”\r\n\r\n[1265] From this statement one might infer either that Bartholomew’s\r\nbook was not yet published or that Thomas did not know of it.\r\n\r\n[1266] HL 30: 384.\r\n\r\n[1267] As HL 30: 374-5 has already noted.\r\n\r\n[1268] HL 30: 383 mentions three such MSS; see also CLM 6908, where,\r\nhowever, the three last books are missing; Lincoln College 57, 13th\r\ncentury; CU Trinity 1058, 13th century; Wolfenbüttel 4499, 14th century.\r\n\r\n[1269] As has been said above, it is doubtful if there was any close\r\nrelation of master and disciple between Albert and Thomas.\r\n\r\n[1270] HL 30: 377.\r\n\r\n[1271] Jacobus de Vitriaco, _libri duo ... prior Orientalis ... alter\r\nOccidentalis Historiae_, 1597, _Hist. Orient._ caps. 85-92.\r\n\r\n[1272] _Experimentator_, however, is also cited concerning the\r\nproperties of air.\r\n\r\n[1273] Thomas’s extracts from Adhelmus were printed by Pitra (1855)\r\nIII, 425-7. Concerning St. Aldhelm see above, chapter 27, page 636.\r\n\r\n[1274] Michael Scot is cited concerning silk-worms and gourds in\r\nEgerton 1984, fols. 100r and 121r, and, judging from the catalogue\r\nnotice, also in Corpus Christi 221, but not in the corresponding\r\npassages in either Royal 12-E-XVII or 12-F-VI. The _Histoire\r\nLittéraire_, however, gives a citation of Michael’s translation of\r\nAristotle’s _History of Animals_ from three Paris MSS.\r\n\r\n[1275] Ferckel (1912), p. 4, “und tatsächlich ist fast das ganze\r\nKapitel _De Impregnatione_ ein Teil des folgenden und die erste\r\ngrössere Hälfte des Kapitels 73 fast wörtlich der _Philosophia_ des\r\nWilhelm von Conches entnommen.”\r\n\r\n[1276] “Tanta fides in hoc auctorum est et tanta concordia ut nulli\r\numquam de hoc dubitare relinquatur.”\r\n\r\n[1277] In the condensed version of Egerton 1984 and Arundel 323 the\r\ncastration story is omitted, but the other statement is made.\r\n\r\n[1278] A fuller form of the title is: _Liber apum aut de apibus\r\nmysticis sive de proprietatibus apum seu universale bonum tractans de\r\nprelatis et subditis ubique sparsim exemplis notabilibus_.\r\n\r\n[1279] See especially _Historia animalium_, VI, 31; VIII, 5, IX, 44.\r\n\r\n[1280] In Egerton 1984 and Arundel 323 this statement occurs later and\r\nis ascribed to “Alexander”. These MSS add that in its fore-quarters the\r\nlion is of a hot nature, in the hind-quarters cold, like the Sun in Leo.\r\n\r\n[1281] “Firmitas autem in pectore est.”\r\n\r\n[1282] Egerton 1984, “to be feverish all the time.”\r\n\r\n[1283] EB, 11th edition, “The number of cubs at a birth is from two to\r\nfour, usually three.”\r\n\r\n[1284] _Ibid._ “The lion ... seldom attacks his prey openly, unless\r\ncompelled by extreme hunger.... He appears ... as a general rule only\r\nto kill when hungry or attacked, and not for the mere pleasure of\r\nkilling, as with some other carnivorous animals.”\r\n\r\n[1285] EB, “Though not strictly gregarious, lions appear to be sociable\r\ntowards their own species.”\r\n\r\n[1286] Also Aristotle, IX, 44.\r\n\r\n[1287] EB, 11th edition, “On no occasions are their voices to be heard\r\nin such perfection, or so intensely powerful, as when two or three\r\ntroops of strange lions approach a fountain to drink at the same time.”\r\n\r\n[1288] _Ibid._ “He, moreover, by no means limits himself to animals of\r\nhis own killing, but, according to Selous, often prefers eating game\r\nthat has been killed by man, even when not very fresh, to taking the\r\ntrouble to catch an animal himself.”\r\n\r\n[1289] For instance, I found the passage in Royal 12-E-XVII, but not in\r\nRoyal 12-F-VI.\r\n\r\n[1290] Aristotle, instead of _Experimentator_, in Egerton 1984 and\r\nArundel 323. Of the small amount of marrow in lions’ bones Aristotle\r\ntreats twice, _Historia animalium_ III, 7 and 20.\r\n\r\n[1291] I am told, however, that in a recent moving picture lions are\r\nseen climbing trees to escape from dogs.\r\n\r\n[1292] HL 30: 367.\r\n\r\n[1293] Egerton 1984 and Arundel 323.\r\n\r\n[1294] Omitted in the two MSS mentioned in the preceding note.\r\n\r\n[1295] Compare the similar description of the _magnetised_ needle in\r\nNeckam, _De naturis rerum_, II, 98 (RS 34: 183).\r\n\r\n[1296] HL 30: 370 does not mention this introductory passage but quotes\r\na somewhat similar passage which occurs later on. In fact, Thomas makes\r\npractically the same statement at least three times in the course of\r\nhis fourteenth book.\r\n\r\n[1297] “_Rechel_” in Royal 12-F-VI, fols. 106-7. Printed by Pitra\r\n(1855) III, 335-7, as “Cethel aut veterum Judaeorum Physiologorum de\r\nlapidibus sententiae.”\r\n\r\n[1298] A further discussion of them will be found in Appendix II to\r\nthis chapter.\r\n\r\n[1299] Steinschneider (1906) 54-5, 103-4, fails to include our treatise\r\non seals in his mentions of Zaël’s works; but in BN 16204, 13th\r\ncentury, the _Seals_ of Theel is immediately preceded by two treatises\r\nof “Zehel the Israelite” on interrogations and elections.\r\n\r\n[1300] In the astrological miscellany of Petrus Liechtenstein,\r\nBasel, 1551, fols. 122-7, _Introductorium de principiis judiciorum_;\r\n127-38, _De interrogationibus_; 138-41, _De electionibus_; 141-2, _De\r\nsignificatione temporis ad judicia_. Steinschneider mentions only the\r\n_Elections_ as printed in 1551, but also notes a 1533 edition of it and\r\n1493 and 1519 editions of all these treatises.\r\n\r\n[1301] In cap. 6, _Introductio_, “Scito quod signa sunt duodecim”; in\r\ncap. 9, _Judicia Arabum_, “Cum interrogatus fueris”; _De significatione\r\ntemporis_, “Et scito quod tempore excitat motus”; in cap. 10, _Liber\r\nelectionis_, “Omnes concordati sunt”; _Quinquaginta praeceptorum_,\r\n“Scito quod significata lunae.”\r\n\r\n[1302] CCAG V, 3, 98-106.\r\n\r\n[1303] Steinschneider (1905), p. 34, names Hermann the Dalmatian as\r\ntranslator and notes CUL 2022, 15th century, fols. 102r-115v, Hermanni\r\nsecundi translatio. “Explicit Fatidica Ben Bixir Caldei....,” but the\r\n_Gi_ in the _Explicit_ of the following MS might stand for _Gerardi_\r\nand indicate Gerard of Cremona, who would, it is true, have been but\r\ntwenty-four in 1138: Digby 114, 14th century, fols. 176-99, “Explicit\r\nfetidica Zael Banbinxeir Caldei. Translacio hec mam. Gi. astronomie\r\nlibri anno Domini 1138, 3 kal. Octobris translatus (_sic_) est.”\r\n\r\nSome other MSS which Steinschneider does not mention are: Harleian 80;\r\nSloane 2030, 12-13th century, fols. 41-76; Amplon. Quarto 361, 14th\r\ncentury, fols. 96-113, Chehelbenbis Israelite; and perhaps Sloane 3847,\r\n17th century, fols. 101-12, Zebel alias Zoel, liber imaginum, but more\r\nprobably this is the Pseudo-Zebel found in Berlin 965, 16th century,\r\nfols. 1-63, and printed at Prague, 1592, “Incipit zebelis sapientis\r\narabum de interpretatione diversorum eventuum secundum lunam in 12\r\nsignis zodiaci.”\r\n\r\n[1304] This consecration of gems also follows Techel’s treatise on\r\nseals in Ashmole 1471, fol. 67v, while in Canon. Misc. 285 the work of\r\nThetel is preceded at fol. 36v by _De consecratione lapidum_, and at\r\nfol. 38 by _De modo praecipuos quosdam lapides consecrandi_.\r\n\r\n[1305] Or, in one MS, “sicut dicunt phisici.”\r\n\r\n[1306] This fact has already been noted by the HL.\r\n\r\n[1307] Called _andena_ in one MS, and _alidea_ in another.\r\n\r\n[1308] See above, chapter 51, page 324.\r\n\r\n[1309] Or perhaps “ascendit.”\r\n\r\n[1310] Compare Bede, _De natura rerum_, cap. 25.\r\n\r\n[1311] Petrus de Prussia, _Vita B. Alberti Magni_, (1621), p. 294.\r\n\r\n[1312] Trithemius, _De script, eccles._ probably has Peter and Jacobus\r\nin mind when he states that some writers say that Thomas of Cantimpré\r\nknew Greek and translated the works of Aristotle used in the schools.\r\n\r\n[1313] As Albert lived six years beyond Aquinas, this would indicate\r\nthat his Aristotelian treatises were completed early in life. Yet some\r\naccuse him of using Thomas’s _De natura rerum_ in these works.\r\n\r\n[1314] Additional 17345, late 13th century, imperfect, ascribes the\r\n_antiqua translatio_ of the fourteen books of Metaphysics to him, but\r\nis the only such MS I know of.\r\n\r\n[1315] One wonders if this can mean _Thomas Brabantinus_, whose name\r\nimmediately follows that of _Wilhelmus Brabantinus_ in the list, rather\r\nthan Thomas Aquinas.\r\n\r\n[1316] Ferckel (1912), pp. 1-2, 10.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX I\r\n\r\nTHE MANUSCRIPTS OF THE DE NATURA RERUM\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the half dozen or so MSS which I have examined Egerton 1984, 13th\r\ncentury, fols. 34-145, and Arundel 323, 13th century, fols. 1-98,\r\npresent a different version from the others, arranged in a different\r\norder and somewhat more condensed, although sometimes inserting points\r\nomitted in the other MSS, as has already been illustrated in the text\r\nin the reproduction of the chapter on the lion. These two MSS open\r\nwith what is usually the 16th book on the seven regions of the air and\r\ncontinue with the subjects of the heavens and elements to which books\r\n17-19 are usually devoted. Then, omitting the themes of the usual first\r\nthree books, they consider quadrupeds (Egerton 1984, fol. 51v; Arundel\r\n323, fol. 33r), other animals, and herbs. Then follow precious stones\r\nand metals, after instead of before which comes a truncated version of\r\nthe book on fountains (Egerton 1984, fol. 142v; Arundel 323, fol. 91r).\r\nNext comes a treatment of parts of the human body which roughly answers\r\nto Thomas’s first book but omits entirely the chapters dealing with\r\ngeneration and obstetrics. Indeed in Egerton 1984 the text breaks off\r\nat fol. 145v in the midst of the chapter on teeth and in the middle of\r\na word, and then ends on the upper part of fol. 146r with the closing\r\nportion of the chapter _De anchis_ and the chapter on _Spondilia_.\r\nArundel 323 continues as far as the 44th chapter on the spleen. It then\r\nat fol. 98r introduces a brief discussion of geography (_Incipiunt\r\nDivisiones Provinciarum_), at the close of which we read, “Explicit\r\nliber lucii annisii Senece Cordubensis fortini stoyci discipuli\r\nDe naturis rerum.” The text, however, goes on to fol. 103v with a\r\ndiscussion of diseases, remedies, and astrological medicine. Neither\r\nthis nor the list of provinces forms a part of the _De natura rerum_ as\r\ncontained in Royal 12-E-XVII and 12-F-VI.\r\n\r\nAs the _Histoire Littéraire de la France_ listed only MSS of the _De\r\nnatura rerum_ at Paris and in a few other continental libraries, and as\r\nthe authorship of Thomas of Cantimpré is seldom recognized in the MSS\r\ncatalogues, I append a list of MSS in British and continental libraries\r\nwhich are not noted in the _Histoire Littéraire_. No doubt the list\r\nis still very incomplete. C. Ferckel (1912), pp. 11-18 gives a fuller\r\nlist than that in the _Histoire Littéraire_, but only those MSS which\r\nare marked with an asterisk in the following list have been noted by\r\nFerckel:\r\n\r\n\r\nBritish Museum\r\n\r\n Egerton 1984, 13th century, described above.\r\n\r\n Royal 12-E-XVII, 13th century.\r\n\r\n Royal 12-F-VI, 14th century, fols. 3-119.\r\n\r\n *Arundel 323, perhaps 13th century, described above.\r\n\r\n *Arundel 142, 15th century, fols. 1-93.\r\n\r\n The following contain only portions of the work:\r\n\r\n *Arundel 298, perhaps 13th century, fols. 1-83, Books 3-9.\r\n\r\n *Arundel 164, 15th century, fols. 5-58, preface and four\r\n   books.\r\n\r\n Sloane 2428, 13th century, 9 fols., Book 14 on gems.\r\n\r\n Sloane 405, 15th century, fols. 65-107, “De natura rerum\r\n   liber primus,” attributed to Albertus Magnus but really\r\n   the prologue of Thomas and most of his first book on\r\n   anatomy.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt Oxford\r\n\r\n Selden supra 75 (Bernard 3463), early 14th century, fols.\r\n   1r-231v, de naturis rerum secundum diversos philosophos.\r\n   In 1919 the proof sheets for the new Summary Catalogue of\r\n   Bodleian MSS still stated: “The author, who wrote while\r\n   Jacobus de Vitriaco was bishop of Tusculum (1228-44: fol.\r\n   1v), appears to be unknown.”\r\n\r\n *Canon.

Rose. I have\r\nexamined personally the two Paris MSS and some of those at Oxford.\r\n\r\nBerlin 956, 12th century, fol. 22, what Rose calls the “very peculiar\r\noriginal text.” “Hic incipit liber sigillorum filiorum israel quem\r\nfecerunt in deserto. Cum pluribus libris nobilibus magne auctoritatis\r\net nominis vigilante animo atque perspicaci, fratres karissimi,\r\nstudeamus,” etc., which may be translated: “Here begins the books\r\nof seals of the children of Israel which they made in the desert.\r\nAlthough, dearest brothers, we have studied many noble books of great\r\nauthority and name with vigilant and perspicacious mind, we have not\r\nfound any book so dear and precious as this is. For this is that great\r\nand secret precious book of seals of Cehel the Israelite, which the\r\nchildren of Israel made in the desert after their exodus from Egypt\r\naccording to the course and motion of the stars. And because many false\r\nbooks are made in imitation of this, in order that we may perfectly\r\nknow the virtue of these seals we have noted them down in this little\r\nbook.”\r\n\r\nBN 8454, 12-13th century, fols. 65v-66r, Liber magnus et secretus\r\nsigillorum Cehel. The _Incipit_ and text closely resemble Digby 79,\r\nexcept that the name is spelled “Cehel” and that no mention is made of\r\nthe planets.\r\n\r\nBN 16204, 13th century, pp. 500-7. Has the same _Incipit_ as BN 8454\r\nand Digby 79, except that the name is spelled “Theel” and that the last\r\nclause of the _Incipit_, “et quia multi ... subnotavimus” (for which\r\nsee the description of Digby 79 below) is omitted. On the other hand,\r\nwe have the following opening paragraph of text which is not found in\r\nBN 8454: “I, Theel, one of the sons of the children of Israel, who\r\nafter the transit of the Red Sea ate manna in the wilderness and drank\r\nwater from the rock and saw innumerable miracles with my own eyes, and\r\nheard why from the twelve tribes twelve precious stones are worn by\r\norder of the Lord on Aaron’s vestments. And I myself chose them. And\r\nbesides this selection I have inspected the engraving of gems made, as\r\nthe divine Nature willed, according to the movement of the signs and\r\nthe courses of the planets. And I have learned the virtues of many. And\r\nI am called Theel (or rather, Cheel) for this reason, because I have\r\nwritten of sealing (_de celatione_), that is, concerning the sculpture\r\nof gems, and not because I have concealed and kept to myself what God\r\nand nature have produced, for I write to you, my posterity, in order\r\nthat through these few brief words many seals may be known in the\r\nnature of stones.”\r\n\r\nThis MS then has at pp. 500-2 the same text as BN 8454 except that\r\nthe names of the planets are inserted before the first seven seals.\r\nAt p. 502 the text as given in BN 8454 ends with the words, “Hoc\r\nautem sigillum fertur habuisse galienus,” but the listing of seals\r\ncontinues in BN 16204 until the top of p. 507, where the work of Haly\r\non elections begins.\r\n\r\nDigby 79, 13th century, fols. 178v-180, opens, “In nomine Domini nostri\r\nJesu Christi. Hic est liber preciosus magnus atque secretus sigillorum\r\nEethel quem fecerunt filii Israel in deserto post exitum ab Egipto\r\nsecundum motus et cursus siderum, et quia multi ad similitudinem huius\r\nfalso facti sunt, in hoc libello subnotavimus.” This version differs\r\nfrom that of Thomas of Cantimpré, since its first seal is made under\r\nthe planet Mercury and is an image of a man seated on a plow. Then\r\n“under Mars” comes a fuller description of what is the first seal in\r\nThomas’s version.\r\n\r\nDigby 193, 14th century, fol. 30, closely resembles Digby 79, except\r\nthat the name is spelled “Cethel.”\r\n\r\nAshmole 1471, late 14th century, fols. 65v-67v, closely resembles\r\nThomas of Cantimpré’s text. “Incipit liber Techel. Liber Techel nomine\r\neditus de sculpturis lapidum a filiis Israel eo tempore quo per\r\ndesertum transierunt, et transierunt ut intrarent terram promissionis:\r\npropterea hii lapides leguntur fuisse assignati in templo Appollonis\r\na rege Persarum cum consilio omnium astrologorum tam Egiptiorum quam\r\nCaldeorum secundum cursum signorum et cursum planetarum.” Next ensue\r\nthe same preliminary observations that Thomas makes; the text of Techel\r\nproper begins only at fol. 66v.\r\n\r\nCanon. Misc. 285, 15th century, fol. 40, anon., “In nomine dei Amen;\r\nPretiosissimus liber sigillorum quem filii Israel post exitum....”\r\n\r\nCorpus Christi 221, 14th century, fol. 55.\r\n\r\nSelden 3464 (Bernard), #9.\r\n\r\nCUL 1391, 14th century, fols. 204v-207v, “Liber magnus de sigillis\r\nlapidum et de virtutibus eorum quem fecerunt Filii Israelis in\r\nDeserto.” Like BN 8454 it closes, “hoc sigillum fertur habuisse\r\nGallienus.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIV\r\n\r\nBARTHOLOMEW OF ENGLAND\r\n\r\n\r\n Bartholomew on the character of his book--Question of its\r\n date--Who are the most recent authors cited in it?--How far\r\n are its citations first-hand?--Its medieval currency--Not\r\n a mere compilation nor limited to Biblical topics--The\r\n nature of demons--Psychology and physiology--Vision and\r\n perspective--Medieval domestic science--The medieval\r\n domestic servant--Medieval boys--Medieval girls--A\r\n medieval dinner--Dreams and their interpretation--Medical\r\n advice--Poisons--The waters above the firmament--The\r\n empyrean heaven: Rabanus--Alexander of Hales--Aristotelian\r\n theory of one heaven--As the basis of astrology--Properties\r\n and effects of the signs and planets--Bartholomew\r\n illustrates the general medieval acceptance of\r\n astrology--Medieval divisions of the day and hour--Form\r\n and matter; fire and coal--Air and its creatures--The\r\n swallow, swallow-stone, and swallow-wort--The hoopoe and\r\n magic--Water and fish--Jorath on whales--Geography; physical\r\n and political--Also economic--Medieval boundaries--France\r\n in the thirteenth century--Brittany and the British\r\n Isles--A geography by Herodotus--Two passages about\r\n magic--Bartholomew and Arnold of Saxony on stones--Citations\r\n by Arnold of Saxony and Bartholomew--Virtues of\r\n animals--_Physiologus_--Color, odor, savor, liquor.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Bartholomew on the character of his book.]\r\n\r\n_On the Properties of Things_ by Bartholomew of England[1317] is, as\r\nhas been said in a previous chapter, a work of the same sort as those\r\non the natures of things by his earlier fellow-countryman, Alexander\r\nof Neckam, and his contemporary of Brabant, Thomas of Cantimpré.\r\nBartholomew himself clearly states the character, purpose, and scope of\r\nhis work both at its beginning and again in closing. It is primarily a\r\nbrief compilation of passages on the natures and properties of things,\r\nwhich are scattered through the works both of the saints and the\r\nphilosophers, with the intent of making plainer the enigmas which the\r\nHoly Scriptures conceal under the symbols and figures of the properties\r\nof natural and artificial objects. Bartholomew further speaks modestly\r\nof his work as an elementary treatise, text-book, or work of reference\r\nfor the benefit of “young scholars and the general reader (_simplices\r\net parvuli_) who because of the infinite number of books cannot look\r\nup the properties of the objects of which Scripture treats, nor are\r\nthey able to find quickly even a superficial treatment of what they\r\nare after.”[1318] Bartholomew’s book is therefore “a simple and rude”\r\ncompilation, but he hopes that it may prove useful to persons who, like\r\nhimself, are not advanced scholars. But after mastering this elementary\r\ntreatise, they should proceed to more subtle and specialized works. And\r\nif they think that anything should be added to what he has given, let\r\nthem add it. From the tone of these remarks compared to those of Thomas\r\nof Cantimpré one would infer that the number of available books and\r\nalso the amount of available knowledge had considerably increased since\r\nThomas wrote. Yet at the most Bartholomew cannot have written very\r\nmany years later than Thomas, and it is most likely that their books\r\nappeared almost simultaneously.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Question of its date.]\r\n\r\nIf Bartholomew’s last sentence is interpreted as an open invitation to\r\nhis readers to issue revised editions of the book or at least add to\r\ntheir own copies further extracts from the writings of the saints and\r\nthe philosophers, we shall feel that it is rather risky to attempt to\r\ndetermine the date of the first appearance of the _De proprietatibus\r\nrerum_ from the date of the latest works cited in our present copies.\r\nBut all the manuscripts seem to be essentially alike regardless of\r\ndate, and the printed edition seems to vary little from the text of\r\nthe earliest manuscripts. To assist us in determining when Bartholomew\r\nlived and wrote we have a request from the General of the Franciscan\r\nOrder in 1230 asking the French provincial to send to Magdeburg in\r\nSaxony Brother Bartholomaeus Anglicus to act as lecturer there.[1319]\r\nSalimbene, writing in 1284, cites a passage from Bartholomew concerning\r\nelephants and looks back upon him as a great clerk who lectured on\r\nthe whole Bible in course at Paris.[1320] Bartholomew speaks of the\r\ninhabitants of Livonia as having been forced by the Germans from the\r\ncult of demons to the Faith of one God, and states that by divine grace\r\nand the cooperation of the Germans they are now believed to be freed\r\nfrom their former errors.[1321] But since the conquest of Livonia began\r\nas early as 1202, this passage does not serve to date Bartholomew’s\r\nwork very definitely.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Who are the most recent authors cited in it?]\r\n\r\nIt has already been remarked by the _Histoire Littéraire de la France_\r\nthat in the bibliography at the close of his work Bartholomew mentions\r\nno writer of later date than the early thirteenth century.[1322] As\r\nBartholomew himself states, however, he uses “many other” authorities\r\nthan those given in the list, and other names are found sprinkled\r\nthrough his text. In the printed edition of 1488 the _Speculum\r\nnaturale_ of Vincent of Beauvais, which was not written until 1250,\r\nis cited,[1323] but this mention is found in the last sentence\r\nof a chapter and may be pretty certainly regarded as a later\r\ninterpolation.[1324] In citing commentaries upon the works of Aristotle\r\nthe printed text confuses the abbreviations _Albu._, _Alber._, and\r\n_Alfre._ or _Alur._, standing respectively for Albumasar, Albertus\r\nMagnus, and Aluredus or Alfred of England who alone is listed in\r\nBartholomew’s bibliography. There seems to be no certain citation of\r\nAlbert. If Bartholomew had read Albert’s sharp criticism of Jorath,\r\nhe perhaps would not have made use of that author. The bibliography\r\nincludes the names of Michael Scot who was dead by 1235 and of Robert\r\nof Lincoln, by whom Grosseteste must be meant, who was born about\r\n1175, became bishop of Lincoln in 1235, and died in 1253. A Gilbertus\r\nmentioned in the bibliography may be either the medical writer, Gilbert\r\nof England, whose own date is somewhat uncertain, or a corruption for\r\nGerbert. These three writers are seldom, if ever, cited by name in the\r\ntext of Bartholomew. But he does cite Alexander of Hales[1325] who died\r\nin 1245. On the whole it seems possible that Bartholomew wrote his work\r\nas early as 1230.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: How far are its citations first-hand?]\r\n\r\nThe _Histoire Littéraire_ asserts that “Bartholomew surely was not\r\nacquainted with all the authors, true or supposititious, whom he is\r\npleased to enumerate,” but it gives no grounds except the list itself\r\nfor this sceptical attitude. It is true that in the case of a few\r\nauthorities in his list, such as Scipio Africanus, Ninus Delphicus,\r\nand Epicurus, it would have been as difficult to find any works by\r\nthem then as now. But I believe that Bartholomew was a wide reader\r\nand acquainted with the greater part of the books and authors that\r\nhe cites. Modern writers concerning medieval learning have too often\r\nproceeded upon the gratuitous assumption that medieval writers seldom\r\nwere directly acquainted with the authorities which they cite. But\r\none suspects that those who have assumed this were none too well\r\nacquainted themselves either with the works citing or cited. And\r\nwhy should medieval scholars take their citations at second hand?\r\nThe original works were fairly accessible; the earliest manuscripts\r\nwe have of them are almost invariably medieval, and probably they\r\nhad many, many more copies that are now destroyed, and possibly\r\nsome originals that are now forever lost. As for Bartholomew, his\r\ncitations are so numerous, so varied, so specific that they must be\r\nlargely first-hand.[1326] Obviously he did not spare himself trouble\r\nin making a book to save others trouble. Bartholomew also seems to be\r\nscrupulously honest in his citations. For instance, Pythagoras is cited\r\nbut once in the _Etymologies_ of Isidore,[1327] and when Bartholomew\r\nmakes use of this passage, he gives both Pythagoras and Isidore\r\ncredit.[1328] It is therefore only fair to Bartholomew to admit that,\r\nhad his citation of Pythagoras in _The Book of the Romans_ been drawn\r\nfrom any third author, he would have given him credit too. Bartholomew\r\ncites Pliny’s _Natural History_ by book and chapter and is evidently\r\ndirectly acquainted with it. On the whole, I am inclined to think that\r\nmedieval writers had read quite as much of the works listed in their\r\nbibliographies as modern writers have of those listed in _theirs_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Its medieval currency.]\r\n\r\nIn the Bibliothèque Nationale at Paris alone there are eighteen\r\nmanuscripts of the _De proprietatibus rerum_, chiefly of the late\r\nthirteenth and early fourteenth century, and the _Histoire Littéraire_\r\ntells us that its title appears in a catalogue of the books which\r\nthe medieval booksellers of Paris rented to the students at that\r\nuniversity.[1329] The work also occurs with frequency in the manuscript\r\ncollections of England, Germany, and Italy. Hain’s list of fourteen\r\nprinted editions of it before 1500 is incomplete, and the British\r\nMuseum catalogue of books printed in Germany alone in the fifteenth\r\ncentury mentions nine editions. It was translated into French under\r\nCharles V in the fourteenth century, and also appeared in English,\r\nSpanish, and Dutch versions, all three of which were printed at the\r\nend of the fifteenth century. These facts indicate that the work was,\r\nand continued until the sixteenth century to be, widely used as a\r\ntext-book, and suggest the further thought that such widely multiplied\r\nand disseminated elementary and popular works are more likely to\r\nhave survived the stagnant and destructive period of the Black Death\r\nand Hundred Years War and to have come down to us than are the more\r\nadvanced, original, and elaborate works of the thirteenth century. Be\r\nthat as it may, we must not look upon the _De proprietatibus rerum_ as\r\na specimen of the most advanced medieval scholarship, but rather as an\r\nillustration of the rough general knowledge which every person with any\r\npretense to culture was then supposed to possess. At the same time,\r\nthe large number of authorities cited shows how much wider reading a\r\nmedieval student might do.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Not a mere compilation nor limited to Biblical topics.]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, we must not be misled by Bartholomew’s humble tone\r\nof self-depreciation nor even by his assertion, repeated at the close\r\nas well as the opening of his work, that he presents “little or nothing\r\nof my own, but simply the words of the saints and the sayings of the\r\nphilosophers.” As a matter of fact, he not infrequently alludes to\r\ncontemporary matters or describes daily life without mentioning any\r\nauthorities, and his amusing accounts of such animals as cats and\r\ndogs, or boys and girls, or his instructions how to set a table and\r\ngive a dinner, are almost entirely his own and show considerable power\r\nof observation and dry humor. His chapters on geography, too, deal\r\nin large measure and with unusual fulness with the feudal states and\r\npeoples of his own day: Scotland, Ireland, Flanders, Brabant, Anjou,\r\nPoitou, and so on through a long list alphabetically arranged. In\r\nthese and in other chapters he forgets all about the fact that he is\r\nsupposedly explaining only those things mentioned in the Bible, and\r\nis manifestly actuated by a scientific interest in present facts and\r\nphenomena. The influence of Isidore’s _Etymologies_ upon Bartholomew’s\r\nbook is evident, and Bartholomew often makes Isidore his starting point\r\nin discussing a given topic. But he also often goes far beyond the\r\nother’s brief statements; it seems clear that the scanty contents of\r\nthe _Etymologies_ are no longer deemed sufficient even in an elementary\r\nencylopedia and general text-book. Bartholomew seems to use the\r\nscissors less than Thomas of Cantimpré, to state things more in his own\r\nwords, and not to make such long extracts from or paraphrases of other\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nHowever, in Bartholomew’s first book, whose subject is God, the first\r\ntwo chapters are taken entirely and perhaps discreetly, since the\r\ndifficult problem of the Trinity is under discussion, from an _Extra_\r\nof Innocent III, while the third chapter is drawn from more varied\r\nauthorities, such as Augustine, the treatise on the Trinity ascribed\r\nto Boethius,[1330] and the more recent Hugh and Richard, both of St.\r\nVictor. Presently the theme of divine names is discussed[1331] and\r\nBartholomew lists and explains the ten Hebrew names of God, which are\r\nfound also in Isidore, namely: El, Eloe, Sabbaoth, Zelioz or Ramathel,\r\nEyel, Adonay, Ya, Tetragrammaton, Saday, and Eloym.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The nature of demons.]\r\n\r\nIn the second book on the properties of angels is also discussed the\r\nnature of demons.[1332] They are naturally perspicacious in matters\r\nof science and powerful by their “sense of nature”--a phrase which\r\nwe have already met in William of Auvergne, whom, however, I think\r\nBartholomew does not cite; perhaps it was a technical expression that\r\nspread rapidly from mouth to mouth of medieval psychologists as such\r\nexpressions do today,--experience of time, and knowledge of Scripture.\r\nThey can predict many future events, partly because their knowledge\r\nof nature gained through their subtler senses is superior to man’s,\r\npartly because of their longer lives which permit them to learn more,\r\npartly by angelic revelation. Their bodies were celestial before they\r\ntransgressed but now are aerial. Apuleius’s characterization of them is\r\nrepeated _via_ Augustine, whose explanation is also given, that they\r\nknow occult virtues in nature which are hidden from us and by which\r\nthey are able to accelerate natural processes and work feats of magic\r\nsuch as those performed by Pharaoh’s magicians.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Psychology and physiology.]\r\n\r\nBartholomew’s third book may be described as psychological and\r\ndiscusses the human mind or soul (_anima_), of which definitions by\r\nvarious Greek philosophers are repeated, and the senses. The fourth\r\nand fifth books are physiological. These three books seem to be based\r\nmainly upon the writings of Constantinus Africanus; less frequently\r\nAristotle and other authorities are cited. One treatise is ascribed to\r\nAvicenna and Constantinus which is not in Peter the Deacon’s list of\r\nthe latter’s works, namely, a treatise on poisonous animals and poisons\r\nand presumably a translation of Avicenna by Constantinus.[1333] In this\r\nconnection we are told that while some animals have poisonous tongues\r\nlike snakes, others have medicinal and healing tongues like the dog, as\r\nCassiodorus says, and either from the goodness of nature or from some\r\noccult property.[1334] We have already noted elsewhere Bartholomew’s\r\nacceptance of the usual medieval theory of three brain cells devoted\r\nto three mental faculties, in which connection he cites Johannitius\r\nor Hunain ibn Ishak.[1335] In discussing the disease of _melancholia_\r\nBartholomew tells of a noble whom he knew who imagined that he was a\r\ncat and insisted upon sleeping under the bed in order to watch the\r\nmouse holes.[1336] In a later passage in his seventh book Bartholomew\r\nrepeats Constantinus’ distinction between mania as an infection of\r\nthe anterior cell of the brain with injury to the imagination and\r\nmelancholia as an infection of the central cell with loss of one’s\r\nreason.[1337]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Vision and perspective.]\r\n\r\nIn discussing vision Bartholomew gives the views of “an author of the\r\nscience of perspective” precedence over those of Constantinus.[1338]\r\nThis author believes that in vision three coterminous pyramids or cones\r\nare formed with the apex of each in the pupil of the eye and the base\r\nformed by the object seen. One pyramid is made up of _species_ from\r\nthe object coming along straight lines to the center of the eye. The\r\nsecond pyramid is made by the vision going out from the eye to the\r\nobject seen. The third pyramid consists of light, which, as Bartholomew\r\nexplains elsewhere[1339] on the authority of Basel and Dionysius\r\nand Augustine, is a distinct substance by which other bodies are\r\nilluminated. Light was created three days before sun and moon which are\r\nsimply vehicles for it. But while this light is always shining, whether\r\nvisibly or invisibly, it produces illumination only when other bodies\r\nare in a condition to receive it. The human eye can see itself only by\r\nthe reflection of rays, “and possibly the vision delights in the sight\r\nof a mirror because through reflection of rays it is, by returning to\r\nitself, fortified as it were and in a way strengthened.”[1340]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Medieval domestic science.]\r\n\r\nBartholomew’s sixth book is entitled, “Of ages,” but really deals\r\nmore with matters of daily family and domestic life, discussing in\r\naddition to age, death, infancy, childhood, manhood, such family\r\nrelationships as father, mother, and daughter, and such domestic\r\nconcerns as servants, food and drink, dinners and banquets, sleep and\r\nwaking, dreams and exercise. This last topic of exercise is discussed\r\nlargely in the words of a sermon by Fulgentius, but in other chapters\r\nBartholomew writes so vividly from his own observation that he deserves\r\nquotation, although the themes are somewhat of a digression from our\r\nmain subject.[1341]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The medieval domestic servant.]\r\n\r\n“The handmaid is a female slave deputed to make herself useful to the\r\nhousewife. She is assigned to the more laborious and demeaning tasks,\r\nshe is fed with coarser food, she is clad in meaner clothing, she is\r\noppressed by the yoke of servitude.” Her son becomes a serf and, if she\r\nis of servile condition, so does a freeman who marries her, nor is she\r\npermitted to marry as she chooses. “Like the serf, she is because of\r\nthe vice of ingratitude recalled after being manumitted, is afflicted\r\nwith scoldings, is bruised by rods and beatings, is oppressed by varied\r\nand conflicting vexations and anxieties, is scarcely permitted to\r\nbreathe amid her miseries.” Such painting of her woes does not imply\r\nmuch sympathy on Bartholomew’s part, however, since he concludes by\r\nsaying that it is written that whoso nourishes his servant delicately\r\nwill find him insolent in the end.[1342]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Medieval boys.]\r\n\r\nBoys have a great capacity for mischief but are susceptible to\r\ndiscipline, if put under tutors and compelled to submit to it. Their\r\nconstitutions are hot and moist, their flesh is soft, their bodies\r\nare flexible, agile, and light; their minds are docile. They lead a\r\nsafe life without care and worry, appreciating only play, fearing no\r\ndanger more than the rod, loving apples better than gold. They go naked\r\nunashamed; they are heedless of praise or scolding, easily angered and\r\neasily placated, easily hurt in the body and unable to endure much\r\nwork. The hot humor that dominates them makes them restless and fickle.\r\nThey tend to eat too much and are susceptible to various diseases in\r\nconsequence. They think only of the present and care nothing for the\r\nfuture; they love games and vanities but refuse to attend to gain and\r\nutility. “The least things they think the greatest, and vice versa.”\r\n“They want what is hurtful and contrary to them.” They do not remember\r\nfavors received. All that they see they desire and imitate. They prefer\r\nto talk with and take advice from other boys, and shun the company of\r\ntheir elders. They can’t keep secrets. They laugh or cry easily, and\r\nthey are continually shouting, talking, or chattering, and can scarcely\r\nkeep still even while they are asleep.[1343]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Medieval girls.]\r\n\r\nGirls “are in constitution hot, moist, and of delicate health; in\r\nphysique graceful and flexible and beautiful; in mental attitude modest\r\nand timid and playful; in their social relations well trained in\r\nmanners, cautious and reticent in speech, luxurious in dress.” After\r\nquoting Aristotle to the effect that women generally have longer and\r\nsofter hair than men and a longer neck, and remarking the peculiarities\r\nof their complexions and figures, Bartholomew says further that they\r\nhave slenderer and more flexible hands and feet, a weaker voice,\r\nvoluble and ready speech, that they take short steps, and that in\r\nmind they tend to be haughty, are prone to wrath, tenacious in hate,\r\nmerciful, jealous, impatient of labor, docile, tricky, bitter, and\r\n“headlong in lust.”[1344] Whether Bartholomew is inconsistent in this\r\npassage or believes that the female nature is, the reader must judge.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A medieval dinner.]\r\n\r\nThese are Bartholomew’s instructions for giving a dinner party: “First\r\nthe food is prepared; at the same time the guests are assembled; chairs\r\nand also stools are required; in the dining room tables are set and the\r\ntable furnishings are arranged and adorned. The guests with the host\r\nare placed at the head table, but they do not sit down at table before\r\nthe hands of the guests are washed; next the host’s children and then\r\nthe servants are grouped together at table. Spoons, knives, and salt\r\ncellars are first placed upon the table. Loaves of bread and cups of\r\nwine are presently added. There follow many and varied courses; the\r\nbutlers and waiters serve each person diligently. The guests joyfully\r\nengage in vying with one another in pledging toasts; they are cheered\r\nwith viols and citharas; now the wines and now the courses are\r\nrenewed; they divide and share with one another the dishes which happen\r\nto be opposite them; finally the fruit and dessert are brought in.\r\nWhen dinner is finished, the table furnishings and remains of food are\r\ncarried away and the tables are set aside. Hands are again washed and\r\nwiped; thanks are returned to God and to the host; for the sake of good\r\ncheer the cups go round again and again. When these features of the\r\ndinner are over, the guests either are offered couches for some rest,\r\nor are allowed to return home.”[1345]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Dreams and their interpretation.]\r\n\r\nIn a chapter on dreams Bartholomew declares that they are sometimes\r\ntrue and sometimes false. One should neither put indiscriminate faith\r\nin them nor spurn them entirely, since sometimes certain conjectures\r\nconcerning the future may be had through dreams. Moreover, the meaning\r\nof some dreams is evident at once; others require interpretation.\r\nDreams arise from varied sources, being produced by divine inspiration,\r\nby angelic administration, by diabolic illusion, or by natural and\r\nbodily causes.[1346]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Medical advice.]\r\n\r\nBartholomew’s seventh book is medical, treating of infirmities in\r\nseventy chapters. His desire to be brief is probably what restrains\r\nhim from including any long medical concoctions. He continues to make\r\nmuch use of Constantinus Africanus, who is cited in almost every\r\nchapter, and whose “many other experiments”[1347] Bartholomew often\r\nhas not time to include. One of the cures cited from Constantinus is\r\nto scarify the shin bones in order to cure a headache, the theory\r\nbeing that this will remove the injurious humor from the head to the\r\nlower extremities.[1348] A part of the treatment prescribed for cases\r\nof frenzy is to shave the scalp and wash it with tepid vinegar or\r\ncover it with plasters made of the lung of a pig or cow. Keeping the\r\npatient firmly bound in a dark place, bleeding him, and abstaining\r\nfrom answering his foolish questions are other features of the regimen\r\nsuggested.[1349] To rouse a patient from a state of stupor and\r\nlethargy it is recommended to pull hard at his hair or beard, dash cold\r\nwater frequently in his face, or make a stench under him.[1350] An\r\n“experiment” against epilepsy from Platearius consists in scarifying\r\nthree drops of blood from the patient’s scalp and at the end of the fit\r\ngiving them to him to eat with a crow’s egg.[1351] Indeed crow’s eggs\r\nalone are regarded as quite beneficial. To Platearius is also credited\r\nthe following method “of curing or at least palliating leprosy.”[1352]\r\nTake a red snake with a white belly, remove the venom, cut off the\r\nhead and tail, cook it with leeks, and administer it frequently with\r\nfood,--a preparation roughly similar to theriac. Wine in which a\r\nsnake has lain putrefying a long time is “a medicine useful for many\r\ndiseases,” and Bartholomew repeats the tale we have heard before of\r\nthe woman who caused her blind husband to recover his sight instead of\r\nkilling him when she cooked a snake instead of an eel with garlic for\r\nhim to eat. After such liberties had been taken with his blindness, one\r\nwould expect a husband to recover his sight, if he could!\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Poisons.]\r\n\r\nThe poisons of venomous animals differ. The venom of the viper is hot\r\nand dry; that of the scorpion, cold and dry; that of the spider, cold\r\nand moist. Avicenna says that the poison of the male is really more\r\ndeadly than that of the female, but female serpents have more teeth\r\nand so are perhaps worse on the whole. The venom of the old is more\r\ninjurious than that of the young; that of a fasting animal is more\r\nharmful than that of a full animal; and poisons are worse in summer\r\nthan winter, and at noon than at night.[1353] “Diascorides” says[1354]\r\nthat river crabs possess an occult virtue against the bite of mad dogs,\r\nand their ashes taken with gentian are a singular remedy. A scorpion\r\nsting may be cured by placing oil in which the scorpion has been\r\ndrowned or boiled upon the puncture, or by pulverizing the scorpion’s\r\nbody and placing it upon the wound. The idea of course is that the\r\npoison will return to the body from which it came.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The waters above the firmament.]\r\n\r\nIn book eight Bartholomew discusses the universe and celestial bodies.\r\nAccording to the tradition of the saints there is a visible and an\r\ninvisible heaven. The visible heaven is multiplex and subdivides into\r\nseven heavens, the aerial, ethereal, fiery, Olympian, the firmament,\r\nthe aqueous or crystalline, and the empyrean. The authority of\r\nScripture concerning the waters above the firmament causes Bartholomew\r\nto accept the existence of an aqueous or crystalline heaven. But he\r\nrejects Bede’s view that these waters are cold and congealed in order\r\nto temper the excessive heat generated by the swift revolution of the\r\nother heavens, for Job tells us that there is concord and harmony\r\nin the heavens, and cold and humid waters would be contrary to the\r\ncelestial substance of the heavens. Therefore “the moderns” have in\r\nBartholomew’s opinion “investigated the inmost secrets of philosophy\r\nmore profoundly,” when, as Alexander of Hales states, they suggest\r\nthat those waters are neither frigid, fluid, and humid, nor congealed,\r\nsolid, and ponderous, but on the contrary very mobile and remarkable\r\nfor their clearness and transparency. It is not because they are\r\ncongealed but because they are transparent that this heaven is called\r\ncrystalline.[1355] In other words, the “waters above the firmament” are\r\nnot really waters. And the original modern investigator who ventured\r\nto dispute Bede’s authority on the subject of the waters above the\r\nfirmament was not Alexander of Hales but, as we have seen, William of\r\nConches, whom Bartholomew lists in his bibliography and quotes in other\r\npassages, although he does not mention him by name here.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The empyrean heaven: Rabanus.]\r\n\r\nOf the other heavens Bartholomew gives most space to the empyrean. It\r\nis by nature immobile and unmoved and consequently is not essential\r\nlike the other heavens for the continued generation of things in our\r\ninferior world, but rather, as Alexander of Hales says, to round out\r\nthe universe and the types of bodies in it. Bartholomew continues:\r\n“The empyrean heaven is the first body, simplest in nature, the least\r\ncorporeal, the subtlest, the first firmament of the world, largest in\r\nquantity, lucid in quality, spherical in shape, loftiest in location\r\nsince farthest from the center, embracing in its amplitude spirits and\r\nbodies visible and invisible, and the abode of the supreme God; for\r\nGod may be everywhere, yet he is said especially to be in the heaven,\r\nsince there shines most powerfully the working of his virtue.”[1356]\r\nAfter this description of the last of the visible heavens as the abode\r\nof invisible spirits and of God Himself there does not seem to be much\r\ncall for an invisible heaven, which Bartholomew himself seems by this\r\ntime to have forgotten. For the passage just quoted he cites Rabanus\r\nas his source “who employs the words of Basil in the _Hexaemeron_,”\r\nbut I have been unable to find the passage either in the _Hexaemeron_\r\nof Basil or the works of Rabanus Maurus.[1357] Nor have I been able to\r\nfind several other citations which Bartholomew makes from Rabanus in\r\nmatters astronomical and astrological.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Alexander of Hales.]\r\n\r\nA word may be introduced concerning Alexander of Hales, whom\r\nBartholomew has twice cited in the foregoing passages, but whom we\r\nprobably shall not have occasion to mention again. Like Bartholomew,\r\nhe was an Englishman and a Franciscan, and Bartholomew may have been\r\neither an attendant upon his lectures or his colleague at Paris.\r\nHe died in 1245 and is known as one of the first to attempt to fit\r\ntogether previous Christian opinion and theology with the newly\r\nintroduced works of Aristotle and writings of the Arabs. Of this we see\r\nevidence in the citations made from him by Bartholomew. But Alexander’s\r\nfield was primarily theology and not natural science.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Aristotelian theory of one heaven.]\r\n\r\nWhile the saints may regard the heavens as manifold and list as many as\r\nseven of them,[1358] the philosophers will admit only one heaven, says\r\nBartholomew, who this time correctly quotes Basil as affirming in the\r\n_Hexaemeron_ that “the philosophers would rather gnaw out their tongues\r\nthan admit that there are many heavens.” Bartholomew also presents\r\nAristotle’s view in the _Liber de celo et mundo_ that the heaven is\r\ncharacterized by the greatest possible simplicity and purity and has no\r\ndivision or contrariety of parts. According to the new translation of\r\n_De celo et mundo_ it is “a perfect complete unit to which there is no\r\nlike, neither fabricated nor generated,” and with an equal, single, and\r\ncircular motion. In the _De causis elementorum_ Aristotle holds further\r\nthat the heaven is a fifth element, differing in natural properties and\r\ndistinct from the four elements and not like them subject to generation\r\nand corruption.[1359] Indeed, they would destroy one another by their\r\nmutual contrariety and repugnance were it not for the conciliating\r\ninfluence of celestial virtue.[1360] But while the heaven is one, it\r\nhas many orbs and circles of varying figure and magnitude, and there\r\nis a greater aggregation of light in the stars than in other parts\r\nof the sky. Such variations account for the varying or even contrary\r\neffects produced by the heaven in our lower world at different times\r\nand places, and explain why the pure sky causes corruption as well as\r\ngeneration here below.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: As the basis of astrology.]\r\n\r\nThe Aristotelian foundation thus laid for the superstructure of\r\nastrological science and art is apparently accepted by Bartholomew, who\r\nstates that “the Creator established the heaven as the cause and origin\r\nof generation and corruption, and therefore it was necessary that it\r\nshould not be subject to generation and corruption.” In short, the\r\nuniverse divides into two parts. The heaven, beginning with the circle\r\nof the moon, is the nobler, simpler, superior, and active portion\r\nof the universe. The other part, extending from the sphere of the\r\nmoon downward to earth’s center, is inferior, passive, acted upon and\r\ngoverned by the heaven. In all his later scientific and astrological\r\ndiscussion Bartholomew implies this hypothesis, and, after the two\r\nchapters which we have already summarized on the waters above the\r\nfirmament and the empyrean heaven, pays no more attention to the seven\r\nheavens of the saints. The firmament, “called by the philosophers the\r\nfirst heaven and the last, in whose convexity are situated the bodies\r\nof stars and planets,” absorbs his attention during the remaining\r\nforty-eight chapters of his eighth book. “By means of its motion, it is\r\nthe effective principle of generation and corruption in the inferior\r\nworld.” Rabanus explains how its rays converge as toward a center upon\r\nthe earth’s surface and exert a concentrated impression there; and the\r\nscience of perspective also illustrates this. The three less stable\r\nelements, air, fire, and water, obey the firmament even to the extent\r\nof local motion, as is illustrated by the tides. The element earth is\r\nnot influenced in this way, but produces diverse species from itself in\r\nobedience to the celestial impressions which it receives.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Properties and effects of the signs and planets.]\r\n\r\nBartholomew discusses the signs of the zodiac in much the usual\r\nastrological fashion. They are given animal names because in their\r\neffects they represent the properties of those animals.[1361] In their\r\neffects, too, they may be distinguished as hot or cold, masculine or\r\nfeminine, diurnal or nocturnal; and they are grouped in trios with\r\nthe four elements and cardinal points and in varied relations with\r\nthe planets. Each governs its portion of the human body; thus the Ram\r\n“dominates the head and face, and produces a hairy body, a crooked\r\nframe, an oblique face, heavy eyes, short ears, a long neck.”[1362]\r\nEach sign also has its bearings on human life; thus Virgo is “the\r\nhouse of sickness, of serfs and handmaids and the domestic animals.\r\nIt signifies inconstancy and changing from place to place.”[1363]\r\nBartholomew indeed devotes a separate chapter to “the properties and\r\noccult virtues” of each sign “according to the astrologers.”[1364] The\r\nseven planets by their progress through the signs and conjunctions in\r\nthem influence every creature on earth.[1365] Bartholomew outlines\r\ntheir successive control of the formation of the child in the womb.\r\nHe also devotes a chapter to the influence of each planet. Mars, for\r\nexample, “disposes men to mobility and levity of mind, to wrath and\r\nanimosity and other choleric passions; it also fits men for arts\r\nemploying fire such as those of smiths and bakers, just as Saturn\r\nproduces agriculturists and porters of heavy weights, and Jupiter on\r\nthe contrary turns out men adapted to lighter pursuits such as orators\r\nand money-changers.”[1366] Bartholomew also discusses the head and tail\r\nof the dragon as “two stars which are not planets but yet seem to have\r\nthe nature and influence of the planets.”[1367] The fixed stars, too,\r\nhave their influence, causing storms or clear weather and, according\r\nto the _mathematici_, presignifying sad or glad events. Bartholomew\r\nfurther sets forth the theory of the _magnus annus_ or return of all\r\nthe stars to the same positions after an interval of 15,000 or 36,000\r\nyears. “But whatever the philosophers have said concerning it, this\r\nmuch is sure that it is not for us to determine the last day.”[1368]\r\nGod alone knows. Bartholomew’s most frequently cited authorities on\r\nthe subject of astrology seem to be Albumasar, Messahala[1369] (Ma\r\nSha’Allah), and Alphraganus.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Bartholomew illustrates the general medieval acceptance of\r\nastrology.]\r\n\r\nThus Bartholomew, a Franciscan in good standing, who lectured on the\r\nBible at Paris and was called by the General of his Order to lecture\r\nin Saxony, in a work intended for elementary students and the general\r\nreader, far from engaging in any tilt with the astrologers or\r\nattacking their art as involving fatalism and contrary to morality and\r\nfree will, affirms the general law of the control of earth by sky and\r\nrepeats with little or no question a mass of astrological detail from\r\nArabian writers. After such an exhibition as this of what a commonplace\r\nand matter-of-course affair astrological theory was in the thirteenth\r\ncentury, how impossible it is to have the least sympathy with those\r\nspecialists in medieval learning who would have the work of Daniel of\r\nMorley shunned like the pest because of its astrological doctrine,\r\nor account for Bacon’s imprisonment in 1278 by his astrological\r\ndoctrine, or deny that Albertus Magnus could have written the _Speculum\r\nastronomiae_ with its astrological doctrine. But of Bacon and Albertus\r\nmore later.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Medieval divisions of the day and hour.]\r\n\r\nBartholomew’s ninth book deals with time and its parts. He defines a\r\nday as the time occupied by a complete revolution of the sun around\r\nthe earth, and states that a day consists of twenty-four hours, or\r\nof four “quarters” of six hours each. But he seems unacquainted with\r\nour division of the hour into sixty minutes and the minute into sixty\r\nseconds. Instead he subdivides the hour into four “points” or forty\r\n“moments.” Each moment is thus equivalent to a minute and a half of\r\nour time, and it may be divided further into twelve _unciae_ (ounces),\r\nwhile each _uncia_ includes forty-seven atoms, making 22,560 atoms\r\nin an hour as against 3,600 of our seconds. Honorius of Autun in his\r\n_De imagine mundi_, a work written presumably in the first part of\r\nthe twelfth century, speaks of the hour as a twelfth part of the day,\r\nbut makes it consist of four “points,” forty “moments,” and 22,560\r\natoms just as Bartholomew does. But Honorius also divides the hour\r\ninto ten “minutes,” fifteen “parts,” and sixty _ostenta_, which last\r\nwould correspond to our minutes, if his hour was of the same length as\r\nours. Honorius does not mention the _unciae_ of Bartholomew.[1370]\r\nBartholomew further tells us that Sunday is called the Lord’s Day and\r\nis privileged in many particulars, since on it the world was created,\r\nthe Lord was born, rose from the dead, and also sent the Holy Spirit.\r\nWe have already presented Bartholomew’s discussion of the Egyptian days\r\nin an earlier chapter.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Form and matter: fire and coal.]\r\n\r\nThe tenth book, in nine brief chapters, is entitled, “Form and Matter,”\r\nbut after one chapter on form, discusses the elements. An element,\r\naccording to Constantinus, is a simple substance and the least particle\r\nof a compound body. The rest of the chapters are devoted to the\r\nparticular element fire and to things closely associated with it, such\r\nas flame, smoke, sparks, and ashes. _Carbo_, “Rabanus says, is fire\r\nactually incorporated and united with earthly matter.” Bartholomew’s\r\nfurther description suggests our coal, but perhaps he has only charcoal\r\nin mind.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Air and its creatures.]\r\n\r\nThe eleventh book treats in sixteen chapters of the element air and\r\nits “passions,” such as winds, clouds, rainbows, dew, rain, hail,\r\nsnow, thunder and lightning, and leads up to the following book on\r\nbirds, or rather, creatures of the air, since bees, flies, crickets,\r\nlocusts, bats, and griffins are included in the alphabetical list\r\nof thirty-eight chapters. The birds described are for the most part\r\nfamiliar ones: the eagle, hawk, owl, dove, turtle-dove, quail,\r\nstork, crow, crane, hen, swallow, kite, partridge, peacock, pelican,\r\nscreech-owl, sparrow, vulture, hoopoe, phoenix. Some of these creatures\r\nplace precious stones in their nests to keep off snakes, the eagle\r\nemploying the gem achates[1371] and the griffin an emerald.[1372]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The swallow, swallow-stone, and swallow-wort.]\r\n\r\nSwallows have gems called _celidonii_ in their gizzards, one white and\r\none red. The red variety is called masculine because it is of greater\r\nvirtue than the white kind. These stones are especially valuable if\r\nthey have been extracted from the chick before it touches the ground,\r\n“as is said in _Lapidarius_ where their virtues are described as\r\nConstantinus says.”[1373] _Lapidarius_ can scarcely mean Marbod’s poem\r\non gems, since he wrote later than Constantinus Africanus, and while he\r\ndiscusses the _chelidonius_, he says nothing of extracting it so soon\r\nand describes the colors of its two varieties as black and red,[1374]\r\nand so does Bartholomew later on.[1375] Marcellus Empiricus had called\r\nthem black and white.[1376] _Chelidonius_ seems to be derived from the\r\nGreek word for swallow, χελιδών, and to mean the swallow-stone. Pliny\r\nmentions two varieties but simply states that they are like the swallow\r\nin color, not that they come from its gizzard. Furthermore he describes\r\nthe color of one as purple on one side, of the other as “purple\r\nbesprinkled with black spots.”[1377] Solinus mentions swallows but\r\nsays nothing of any stone connected with them. Bartholomew, however,\r\nalso mentions the herb _celidonia_ or swallow-wort. He cites Macrobius\r\nfor the story that, if anyone blinds the young of swallows, the parent\r\nbirds restore their offspring’s sight by anointing their eyes with the\r\njuice of this herb, a statement which is also found in Pliny.[1378] Not\r\nonly does the swallow contain gems of great virtue and know of healing\r\nherbs; it has medical properties itself. For instance, blood extracted\r\nfrom its right wing is a remedy for the eyes.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The hoopoe and magic.]\r\n\r\nOf the birds described by Bartholomew the _upupa_ or hoopoe is\r\nespecially associated with the practice of magic. Pliny cites the poet\r\nAeschylus as saying that the bird changes its form;[1379] and from\r\nAristotle to modern French peasants it has been believed to build its\r\nnest of human ordure.[1380] After quoting Isidore, who in part uses\r\nPliny,[1381] for the bird’s supposed filthy habits, its frequenting\r\nsepulchers, and the statement that anyone anointed with its blood\r\nwill see demons suffocating him in his dreams, Bartholomew adds that\r\nits heart is used in sorceries. Students of nature (_Phisici_) say\r\nthat when it grows old and cannot see or fly, its offspring tear off\r\nits outworn pinions and bathe its eyes with the juices of herbs--thus\r\njust reversing the relation between the swallow and its young--and\r\nwarm it under their wings until its feathers grow again and, perfectly\r\nrenovated, it is able to see and fly as well as they. In Basil’s\r\n_Hexaemeron_ a similar story is told of the filial devotion of young\r\nstorks toward their aged parent. The hoopoe’s renovation by its young\r\nalso is included in the Latin bestiaries,[1382] but Bartholomew\r\nappears to cite _Phisici_ rather than _Physiologus_.[1383] Thomas of\r\nCantimpré’s chapter on the hoopoe is similar to Bartholomew’s except\r\nthat all he says to connect it with magic is that anointing one’s\r\ntemples with its blood protects one from sorcerers and enchanters; but\r\n“how this is, Experimenter does not state.” Vincent of Beauvais gives\r\na somewhat fuller account of the hoopoe in his _Speculum naturale_\r\nand the bird’s properties are also treated by Albertus Magnus in his\r\n_De animalibus_,[1384] and in the _De mirabilibus mundi_ ascribed to\r\nhim, also by Petrus Hispanus in the _Thesaurus pauperum_,[1385] and\r\nby Arnald of Villanova in _Remedia contra maleficia_. For the use of\r\nthe bird’s heart in magic Vincent cites a _Liber de natura rerum_,\r\nwhich perhaps is the _Liber rerum_ cited by Thomas of Cantimpré,\r\nwho, however, in that case failed to copy the statement in question.\r\nVincent attributes to “Pythagoras in _The Book of the Romans_,” the\r\nstatement that sprinkling a sleeping person with the blood of the\r\nhoopoe will cause him to see phantasms of demons, which is essentially\r\nthe same statement that Bartholomew draws from Isidore and Pliny. But\r\nBartholomew sometimes cites Pythagoras in _The Book of the Romans_.\r\nThese instances show the difficulty of dealing with medieval citations,\r\nbut on the whole indicate that Vincent used independently the same\r\nsources as Thomas and Bartholomew and made a different selection from\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Waters and fish.]\r\n\r\nIn the thirteenth book Bartholomew deals with the element water, with\r\nwells, streams, seas, ponds, pools, and drops of water, with some\r\nparticular bodies of water such as the Tigris, Euphrates, Jordan,\r\nLake of Tiberias, and Mediterranean Sea. In the last chapter fish are\r\nconsidered. As in the account of birds, use is made of Isidore and\r\nPliny, notably concerning the cleverness with which fish escape the\r\nsnares laid for them by fishermen. Some fish are said to help their\r\nfellows withdraw from the basket-like traps set for them by fishermen\r\nby seizing their tails in their mouths and pulling them out backwards.\r\nAristotle, too, is cited and Avicenna is referred to several times\r\non the question whether a particular fish is edible or not. But an\r\nauthority especially employed in this chapter is Jorath or Iorat, who\r\nin the bibliography at the end of the work is called a Chaldean. From\r\nhis book on animals Bartholomew takes such details as that there are\r\nfish who live only three hours, who conceive from dew alone or in\r\naccord with the phases of the moon and the rising and setting of the\r\nstars. Dolphins, when a man is drowning, can tell from the odor whether\r\nhe has ever eaten the flesh of a dolphin. If he has not, they rescue\r\nhim and bring him safe to land; if he has, they devour him on the spot.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Jorath on whales.]\r\n\r\nBartholomew also depends upon Jorath for his account of whales, which\r\nwere not treated of by Pliny. The whale possesses a superabundance of\r\nsperm which floats on the water and, when collected and dried, turns\r\nto amber. When hungry, the whale has only to open its mouth and emit a\r\nfragrant odor like amber, and the other fish, attracted and delighted\r\nthereby, swim into its jaws and down its throat. On some occasions,\r\nhowever, this pleasant breath, if it may be so termed, of the whale\r\nsaves the other fish instead of luring them on to destruction. When\r\na certain serpentine and venomous fish approaches, they take refuge\r\nbehind the whale, who then repels the fetid odor of the newcomer by the\r\nsweetness of his own effusion. While Bartholomew lists the whale along\r\nwith fish, he notes that Jorath says that terrestrial matter dominates\r\nin it over water, and that consequently it becomes very corpulent and\r\nfat, and in its old age dust collects on its back to such an extent\r\nthat vegetation grows there and the creature is often mistaken for an\r\nisland and lures sailors to their destruction,--a reminiscence, we\r\nmay suppose, of one of Lucian’s stories. So fat is the whale that he\r\nmust be wounded deeply to feel it at all, but once his inner flesh is\r\nreached by the weapon, he cannot endure the bitterness of the salt\r\nwater, seeks the shore, and is easily captured. The whale cherishes\r\nits young with wondrous love, and when they are stranded on shoals it\r\nfrees them by spouting water over them. When a severe storm is raging,\r\nit swallows them and they abide safely in its belly until the storm is\r\npast, when it vomits them forth again.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Geography, physical and political.]\r\n\r\nIn the fourteenth book Bartholomew treats of earth, and besides\r\ndefining mountains, hills, valleys, plains, fields, meadows, deserts,\r\ncaves, and ditches in general, describes over thirty particular peaks\r\nor mountain ranges, most of which are named in the Bible, like Ararat,\r\nBethel, Hermon, Hebron, and Horeb. But in the fifteenth book, on\r\nProvinces, his geography is that of classical antiquity and of the\r\nfeudal world of his own time rather than that of Scripture. Where the\r\nmedieval region was known under the same name in antiquity, he is\r\napt to continue to use the old description of it, even though it may\r\nbe really out-of-date and no longer closely applicable. Sometimes,\r\nhowever, as in the chapter on Burgundy, he uses only a little of\r\nIsidore’s description and apparently writes the rest of the paragraph\r\nfrom personal knowledge. And in the case of new localities and names,\r\nfor which he can find no ancient and early medieval authorities, he\r\ndescribes the province intelligently and accurately as it is in his own\r\ntime. On the whole his account, although its 175 chapters are brief, is\r\nof considerable value[1386] for the political geography of Europe in\r\nthe thirteenth century, both as a general survey showing what regions\r\nhe deemed important enough to mention[1387] and what he thought might\r\nbe omitted, and also often for particular details concerning particular\r\nplaces, while it is sometimes enlivened by the spice of local or racial\r\nprejudice.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Also economic.]\r\n\r\nCiting Isidore, Bartholomew divides the world as in a T map into Asia,\r\noccupying one-half the circle, and Europe and Africa each occupying a\r\nquarter. Indeed he says later that Africa is smaller than Europe;[1388]\r\nAfrica of course had not yet been circumnavigated. In speaking of\r\nAlemannia he alludes to other provinces “in either Germany” which are\r\nnot included in his list of chapter headings: Austria and Bavaria near\r\nthe Danube, Alsace along the Rhine, “and many others which it would\r\nbe tedious to enumerate one by one.”[1389] He describes Apulia as the\r\nmaritime region in Italy separated from the island of Sicily by an arm\r\nof the sea, and as a very populous land, full of gold and silver, rich\r\nin grain, wine, and oil, famous for its renowned cities, well fortified\r\nin castles and towns, fertile and fecund in varied crops. Brindisi\r\n(Brundusium) is its metropolis, and across the sea from Apulia to the\r\nsouth is Barbary.[1390] Bartholomew thus uses the term “Apulia” as “Le\r\nPuglie” is used today, to include both ancient Apulia and Calabria,\r\nwhich he does not mention by that name. His description testifies to\r\nthe greater prosperity of that region under the Normans and Frederick\r\nII than in later times, and also shows that Bartholomew is not blind to\r\neconomic conditions in his survey of various regions. He is very apt,\r\nindeed, to tell whether the soil is well-watered and fertile or rocky\r\nand arid, and to describe the other resources of the district and the\r\ncharacteristics of the peoples inhabiting it. He speaks in high praise\r\nof the extensive dominions and sea-power of Venice and of the justice\r\nand concord of its citizens.[1391] He also recognizes the importance of\r\nthe wool trade between England and Flanders.[1392]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Medieval boundaries.]\r\n\r\nBartholomew often undertakes to state the boundaries of a region under\r\ndiscussion. Sometimes he is clear and convincing in this, as when he\r\nstates that Gascony used to be a part of Aquitaine, that it is bounded\r\nby the Pyrenees, the Ocean, and the county of Toulouse, and approaches\r\nthe territory of the Poitevins to the north; that it is drained by\r\nthe Garonne river and that Bordeaux is its metropolis.[1393] Sometimes\r\nhis statements are confusing, but we must remember that feudal states\r\nwere very difficult to bound exactly and varied greatly in extent from\r\ntime to time. Some mistakes in the points of the compass are perhaps\r\nslips of copyists rather than of Bartholomew. He speaks of Brabant and\r\nLorraine as the westernmost or frontier provinces of Germany. Brabant\r\nis bounded on the north by Frisia, the Britannic Ocean (North Sea), and\r\nthe Gulf of Flanders; on the west by lower Gaul and on the south by\r\nupper France. It is watered by the Meuse and Scheldt.[1394] Lorraine is\r\nbounded by Brabant, the Rhine, Alsace, the region of Sens, and Belgic\r\nGaul. Metz is located in it.[1395] Flanders is a province of Belgic\r\nGaul next the seacoast, with Germany to the east, the Gallic sea to the\r\nwest, and the region of Sens and Burgundy to the south.[1396]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: France in the thirteenth century.]\r\n\r\nBartholomew is uncertain whether France is named from the Franks or\r\nfrom a free hangman (_a franco carnifice_) who became king at Paris\r\nand from whom the executioners received privileges. Isidore does not\r\nmention _Francia_, so that Bartholomew does not derive this etymology\r\nfrom him. He seems uncertain also whether to identify France with\r\nall ancient Gaul or simply with Belgic Gaul. He would carry it south\r\nonly to the province of Narbonensis and the Pennine Alps, but east\r\nto the Rhine and Germany. This perhaps is an attestation of the\r\ngrowing territorial power of the French monarch, but perhaps is also a\r\nhold-over from the ancient boundaries of Gaul. At any rate many of his\r\nother regions would overlap and conflict with a France of this size.\r\nHe extols the stone and cement about Paris, which give it an advantage\r\nover other localities in building construction, and he further\r\neulogizes the city itself as the Athens of his age which elevates the\r\nscience and culture not of France only but all Europe.[1397]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Brittany and the British Isles.]\r\n\r\nLéopold Delisle, writing in the _Histoire Littéraire de la France_,\r\nendeavored to claim Bartholomew as a Frenchman, despite the _Anglicus_\r\nthat regularly accompanies his name. Yet for all Bartholomew’s praise\r\nof Paris and Venice, his chapters on England, Ireland, Scotland, and\r\nBrittany[1398] are alone almost enough to determine his nationality.\r\nHe asserts that Brittany should be called _Britannia Minor_, and the\r\nisland _Britannia Maior_ or Great Britain, since Brittany was settled\r\nby fugitive Britons from the island and the daughter should not be\r\nraised to an equality with the mother country, especially since it\r\ncannot equal Great Britain either in population or merit.[1399] Also\r\nBartholomew represents the Irish as savages[1400] and describes the\r\nScots in very unfavorable terms. His view is that if they have any good\r\ncustoms, they borrowed them from the English. He admits, however, that\r\nthe Scots would be good-looking in face and figure, but then adds the\r\ninsulting condition, if they would not insist on deforming themselves\r\nby wearing their national costume.[1401] But as for England, or Albion\r\nas it was once called, after describing it as the largest island in\r\nthe (Atlantic) ocean and recounting some of its legends and history,\r\nBartholomew quotes a metrical description of it as a fertile corner of\r\nthe world, a rich island which has little need of the rest of the world\r\nbut whose products all the rest of the world requires, and whose people\r\nare happy, jocose, and free of mind, tongue, and hand.[1402] Censure of\r\nand prejudice against all others who claim to be British, ill-concealed\r\ninsular pride! Who can doubt that the writer is an Englishman?\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A geography by Herodotus.]\r\n\r\nSome writer named Herodotus is cited a good deal by Bartholomew for\r\nsuch regions as Poitou, Picardy, Saxony, Sclavia, Scotland, and\r\nThuringia, of which the Greek historian Herodotus of course knew\r\nnothing and said nothing.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Two passages about magic.]\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of Finland, we are told, are a barbarous race “occupied\r\nwith magic arts.” They practice divination by means of the number of\r\nknots in a ball of thread and sell favorable winds to the sailors who\r\nnavigate along their shores. In reality, Bartholomew explains, the\r\ndemons send the winds or not, in order to secure the souls of the Finns\r\nin the end.[1403] While we are on the subject of magic, a passage\r\nfrom Bartholomew’s next book may be noted.[1404] Discussing the gem\r\nHeliotrope, he cites Isidore for the statement that “it manifests the\r\nstupidity of enchanters and magicians who glory in their prodigies,\r\nfor they deceive men’s eyes in their operations just as this gem does,\r\nof which he says by way of illustration that together with the herb\r\nof the same name and certain incantations it deceives the gaze of the\r\nspectators and causes them not to see the man who carries it.” But\r\nwhen we turn to the _Etymologies_,[1405] we find that Isidore simply\r\nquotes the sentence of Pliny, “This too is a manifest instance of the\r\nimpudence of the magicians that they say that the bearer of this stone\r\ncannot be seen if he joins to it the herb Heliotrope and adds certain\r\nprayers.” Bartholomew has evidently put his own interpretation upon the\r\npassage.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Bartholomew and Arnold of Saxony on stones.]\r\n\r\nThe last passage has introduced us to Bartholomew’s sixteenth book\r\non gems, minerals, and metals. Valentin Rose,[1406] in what Langlois\r\npraised as “sa belle dissertation sur le _De lapidibus_ aristotélique\r\net sur le _Lapidaire_ d’Arnoldus Saxo,”[1407] exploited a hitherto\r\nobscure German writer, Arnold of Saxony, who appears to be cited only\r\nby Vincent of Beauvais and of whose works but a single manuscript is\r\nknown. Yet Rose would have us believe that Albertus Magnus made much\r\nuse of him without acknowledgment in his work on minerals[1408] and\r\nthat Bartholomew did the same in his sixteenth book. I shall endeavor\r\nto show that it is much more likely that Arnold copied Bartholomew.\r\nFirst, it is less likely that Bartholomew, who was called to Magdeburg\r\nto instruct the Saxons, possibly after his _De proprietatibus rerum_\r\nhad been completed, would have borrowed from one of them than that\r\nthe opposite should be the case. Second, Bartholomew’s work is much\r\nfuller than Arnold’s which Rose admits is “meager and mechanical.”\r\nThird, Bartholomew’s work is professedly a compilation; his object is\r\nto cite his authorities and he usually does so scrupulously; hence if\r\nhe made much use of Arnold, he would certainly mention him somewhere.\r\nFourth, in descriptions of particular stones Arnold of Saxony cites\r\nno authorities but merely makes the lump statement at the start that\r\nhe uses Aristotle, Aaron and Evax, by whom he means Marbod’s poem,\r\nand “Diascorides”; Bartholomew on the other hand in the case of each\r\ngem makes distinct citations from Isidore, _Lapidarius_,[1409] and\r\n“Diascorides,” all of whom he is evidently using directly but with\r\ndiscrimination and in different combinations in each particular case.\r\nFifth, the same stones are treated more fully by Bartholomew than by\r\nArnold, whose terse descriptions suggest the style of an abbreviator.\r\nThus Bartholomew devotes two columns to the sapphire; Arnold gives\r\nit but eleven lines. Sixth, although Rose denied that Arnold used\r\nAristotle and “Diascorides” except in his other work _De virtute\r\nuniversali_, and contended that in his _De virtutibus lapidum_ he used\r\nonly Marbod and one other unknown source, in point of fact almost\r\nevery passage in Arnold which Rose refers to this unknown source is\r\ngiven by Bartholomew as from “Diascorides.” If, therefore, Arnold’s\r\nunknown source is not “Diascorides,” it must be Bartholomew. The\r\nnatural inference is that while Bartholomew has made direct use of\r\nsome treatise passing under the name of Dioscorides, Arnold has not\r\nseen this treatise itself but has probably condensed or extracted it\r\nat second-hand from Bartholomew without acknowledging his indebtedness\r\nto Bartholomew at all and only vaguely acknowledging his debt to\r\n“Diascorides” in his preface. This inference is supported by the use\r\nmade of Isidore on stones by our two authors; Bartholomew uses Isidore\r\ndirectly and cites book and chapter; Arnold repeats indirectly through\r\nMarbod a bare skeleton of brief phrases which originally were in\r\nIsidore.[1410]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Citations by Arnold of Saxony and by Bartholomew.]\r\n\r\nRose further asserted, without printing the passages in question to\r\nsupport his contention, that Albertus Magnus had simply copied a number\r\nof citations from Arnold, such as Jorach on animals, Pictagoras in\r\n_The Book of the Romans_, Esculapius in _De membris_, Zeno in _De\r\nnaturalibus_, Velbetus in _De sensibus_, and Alchyldis _De venenis_.\r\nBut we have already noted that Bartholomew cites Jorath and Pythagoras;\r\nZeno, too, is in his bibliography, and in the introduction to his\r\neighteenth book he cites the _Liber Escolapii de occultis membrorum\r\nvirtutibus_. Vincent of Beauvais also cites these works more than once.\r\nI do not believe that Bartholomew took his citations from Arnold,\r\nand I doubt if either Albert or Vincent did. The probability is that\r\nsuch books were common property then, however little may be known\r\nabout them today, and that it would be as easy then for anyone to lay\r\nhis hand on these books as on the works of Arnold of Saxony, whom\r\nVincent alone mentions. In discussing other mineral substances than\r\ngems, such as metals, sulphur, salt, soda, glass, Bartholomew cites\r\nAristotle, Avicenna, and Platearius as well as _Lapidarius_, Isidore,\r\nand “Diascorides,” but in the seventeenth book on trees and herbs he\r\ncontinues to cite “Dyascorides” and Isidore, although also making\r\nextensive use of Pliny. In the eighteenth book on animals his list\r\nof authorities widens again and he cites Solinus, Papias, Marcianus,\r\nAristotle, Theophrastus, Avicenna, and Isaac, but Pliny continues to be\r\nhis chief reliance.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Virtues of animals.]\r\n\r\nIn the introduction to this book Bartholomew takes the view, supported\r\nby the authority both of Pliny and of John of Damascus,[1411] that all\r\nkinds of animals were created for man’s benefit. Even fleas and vermin,\r\nlike wild beasts and reptiles, are useful in leading him to recognize\r\nhis own infirmity and to invoke the name of God. But furthermore\r\n“there is nothing in the body of an animal which is without manifest\r\nor occult medicinal virtue.” Escolapius in _The Occult Virtues of\r\nMembers_ states that hemorrhoids may be cured by sitting on a lion’s\r\nskin, and Bartholomew lists other examples of amulets, ligatures, and\r\nsuspensions from Pliny and the _Viaticum_ of Constantinus Africanus\r\nas well as “Dyascorides” and “Pitagoras in _The Book of the Romans_.”\r\nThe knowledge of medicinal herbs and the semi-human emotions or moral\r\nvirtues supposed to be possessed by animals also receive the usual\r\ntreatment. Bartholomew informs us that the deadly basilisk loses its\r\nvenomous character when burned to an ash, and that its ashes are\r\nconsidered useful in operations of alchemy and especially in the\r\ntransmutation of metals.[1412] Jerome and Solinus are cited concerning\r\ndragons who overturn ships by flying against their sails, and of\r\nthe use made by the Ethiopians of the blood of dragons against the\r\nsummer’s heat and of their flesh for divers diseases. For as David\r\nsays, “Thou gavest him for food to the peoples of Ethiopia.”[1413]\r\nMarvelous monsters of India are not forgotten, and Aristotle is cited\r\nconcerning a terrible man-eating wolf in India with three sets of\r\nteeth, a lion’s foot, a scorpion’s tail, human face and voice. Its\r\nvoice is furthermore terrible like the sound of a trumpet, and it is\r\nswift as a deer.[1414] Bartholomew’s credulity and scepticism vary with\r\nthe attitude of his authorities. When he finds them in disagreement\r\nover the question whether the beaver castrates itself in order to\r\nescape its hunters--Cicero, Juvenal, Isidore, and Physiologus asserting\r\nthis, while Pliny, Dyascorides, and Platearius deny it--he prefers the\r\narguments of the latter, especially since the experience of his own\r\ntime supports their view.[1415]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Physiologus._]\r\n\r\nPhysiologus is cited a number of times[1416] by Bartholomew concerning\r\nthe snake, crocodile, elephant, wolf, wild ass or _onager_, the\r\nonocentaur who is half human and half ass, panther, siren, and taxo or\r\nmelus. Rather strangely he does not cite Physiologus in describing the\r\nlion. Bartholomew’s citations of Physiologus bear out the points we\r\nhave made in an earlier chapter that Physiologus is one thing, and the\r\nallegorical interpretation of passages cited from Physiologus another\r\nthing, that Physiologus means what it says, “Natural Scientist,”\r\nand not allegorist or moralizer. For although a primary purpose of\r\nBartholomew’s own work is supposed to be the elucidation of the truth\r\nconcealed in Scripture under the symbolism of natural phenomena,\r\nhe cites Physiologus simply for zoological data and omits entirely\r\nthe moral application and spiritual allegory which it has become\r\ncustomary to associate with the term Physiologus. Moreover, much which\r\nBartholomew ascribes to Physiologus cannot be found in any of the\r\nbestiaries which are commonly associated with that name.[1417] This\r\nagain shows how the middle ages added to its ancient authorities.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Color, odor, savor, liquor.]\r\n\r\nIn his nineteenth and last book Bartholomew states that he will treat\r\n“first of color, then of odor, then of savor, last of liquor.” The\r\ndiscussion of color occupies the first thirty-six chapters in which\r\nAristotle is more frequently cited than any other authority. The\r\ncitations become less numerous from chapter eleven to thirty-six[1418]\r\nwhile particular colors are being described, and where Bartholomew\r\nperhaps gives us some original information. Isaac seems to be\r\nBartholomew’s chief authority in the chapters upon smell and taste.\r\nConcerning the latter matter Bartholomew states that the theories of\r\nphilosophers and medical men disagree.[1419] Under the caption of\r\nLiquor he describes honey, mead, _claretum_ (which was a mixture of\r\nwine, honey, and spices), milk, butter, and cheese. These last suggest\r\neggs, and chapters 77 to 113 are devoted to those of various animals.\r\nThe work then proceeds to consider weights and measures, and concludes\r\nwith chapters describing various musical instruments.[1420]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1317] Bartholomew has already been presented in part to\r\nEnglish-speaking readers in Steele’s _Medieval Lore_, London, 1907,\r\nand more recently in excerpts in Coulton’s _Social Life in Britain\r\nfrom the Norman Conquest to the Reformation_, Cambridge, 1918, but\r\ntheir quotations and most other modern references to him are based upon\r\nthe later medieval English versions of his work and not upon his own\r\noriginal Latin text. My summary is based directly upon the Latin text\r\nas printed by Lindelbach at Heidelberg in 1488:\r\n\r\n“_Explicit liber de proprietatibus rerum editus a fratre Bartholomeo\r\nanglico ordinis fratrum minorum. Anno domini Mcccclxxxviii kalendas\r\nvero Junii xii._”\r\n\r\nI am indebted to the liberality of the John Crerar Library in Chicago\r\nin allowing this rare volume to be transported to Cleveland for my use.\r\n\r\nI have also checked up the printed text to some extent by examination\r\nof the following MSS at Paris. On the whole the discrepancies between\r\nthe MSS and printed version seem slight, although a modern critical\r\nedition of Bartholomew’s work is certainly desirable, especially in\r\nview of the rarity of the _editio princeps_.\r\n\r\nBN 16098, 13th century.\r\n\r\nBN 16099, 13th century.\r\n\r\nBN 347, 14th century.\r\n\r\nSince I finished this chapter a paper has appeared by G.

C. Coulton’s _Social Life in Britain from the\r\nConquest to the Reformation_, Cambridge, 1918, in which he has selected\r\nalmost exactly the same passages from Bartholomew as illustrations\r\nof his theme. This is welcome confirmation of their interest and\r\nimportance, and I have decided to let the following paragraphs\r\nstand for two reasons, despite the fact that they are now available\r\nelsewhere in English. In the first place any description of the _De\r\nproprietatibus rerum_ would seem rather incomplete without them. In\r\nthe second place Mr. Coulton gives the passages in Trevisa’s English\r\ntranslation, while I have made a translation direct from the Latin text\r\nin more modern English. The exaggerated impression of quaintness and\r\nilliteracy which the old English version makes upon the modern reader\r\nfinds in my opinion little or no justification in the original Latin.\r\nMen apparently could think more directly in Latin in the thirteenth\r\ncentury than they could express themselves in English in the fourteenth\r\nor fifteenth century.\r\n\r\n[1342] VI, 11.\r\n\r\n[1343] VI, 5.\r\n\r\n[1344] VI, 6.\r\n\r\n[1345] VI, 22.\r\n\r\n[1346] VI, 27.\r\n\r\n[1347] VII, 9 and 16.\r\n\r\n[1348] VII, 2.\r\n\r\n[1349] VII, 4.\r\n\r\n[1350] VII, 6.\r\n\r\n[1351] VII, 9.\r\n\r\n[1352] VII, 64.\r\n\r\n[1353] VII, 66.\r\n\r\n[1354] VII, 68.\r\n\r\n[1355] VIII, 3.\r\n\r\n[1356] VIII, 4.\r\n\r\n[1357] At least as printed in Migne, PL.\r\n\r\n[1358] R. H. Charles, in discussing “The Seven Heavens--an early Jewish\r\nand Christian belief” (Morfill and Charles, _The Book of the Secrets of\r\nEnoch_, Oxford, 1896, pp. xxx-xlvii), asserts that after Chrysostom,\r\n“Finally such conceptions, failing in the course of the next few\r\ncenturies to find a home in Christian lands, betook themselves to\r\nMohammedan countries” (_Ibid._, xxxi-xxxii). But Bartholomew ascribes\r\nto “the tradition of the saints” a belief in the plurality of heavens\r\nand a sevenfold division of them other than the planetary spheres.\r\n\r\n[1359] VIII, 2.\r\n\r\n[1360] VIII, 28.\r\n\r\n[1361] VIII, 9.\r\n\r\n[1362] VIII, 10.\r\n\r\n[1363] VIII, 15.\r\n\r\n[1364] VIII, 21, which is the last of the twelve chapters.\r\n\r\n[1365] VIII, 22.\r\n\r\n[1366] VIII, 25.\r\n\r\n[1367] VIII, 31.\r\n\r\n[1368] VIII, 33.\r\n\r\n[1369] In the bibliography _Miselat astrologus_; in the text Misa.,\r\nMisael, mesahel, Misalach, etc. I am convinced that none of these is\r\nmeant for Michael Scot who is also listed in the bibliography but does\r\nnot seem to be cited in the text.\r\n\r\n[1370] Migne, PL vol. 172, col. 147, “Hora ... est duodecim pars\r\ndiei, constans ex quatuor punctis, minutis decem, partibus quindecim,\r\nmomentis quadraginta, ostentis sexaginta, atomis viginti duobus mil,\r\nquingentis et sexaginta.”\r\n\r\n[1371] XII, 1.\r\n\r\n[1372] XII, 19.\r\n\r\n[1373] XII, 21, “hi lapidi dicuntur celidonii et sunt preciosi maxime\r\nquando extrahuntur de pullo antequam tangat terram ut dicitur in\r\nlapidario ubi eorum virtutes describuntur, ut dicit Constan.

Delisle gave extracts from Bartholomew’s descriptions of\r\nseveral French provinces to show that he knew them well and stated that\r\nhe gave much fewer details concerning England, but that he (Delisle)\r\nwould transcribe the chapter “parce qu’on pourrait supposer qu’il\r\nrenferme des allusions à la prétendue origine anglaise de Barthélemi.”\r\nDelisle also cited (p. 362) the chapter on Britannia, but omitted the\r\nstatements which I shall cite, and earlier said (p. 358), “Nous n’avons\r\nrien à relever dans les chapitres de la Normandie, de la Bretagne,” etc.\r\n\r\nYet the statements I shall cite occur in both the MSS which Delisle\r\nused, where the chapter on Britannia is continued beyond the point\r\nwhere his quotation leaves off as follows:\r\n\r\nBN 16098, 13th century, fol. 14Or. “Est autem alia britannia minor\r\nsuper oceanum aquitanicum sita in partibus galliarum que a britonibus\r\nrelinquentibus britanniam maiorem propter importunitatem germanorum\r\nest usque hodie populata, vero usque adhuc genus britonum et nomen\r\nperseverat, et quamvis hec britannia in multis laude digna sit, non\r\npotest tamen filia matri, minor britannia maiori comparari, et immo\r\nbene minor britannia debuit vocari que sicut nec numero populi sic nec\r\nmerito soli potest maiori britannia adequari.”\r\n\r\nBN 347, 14th century, fol. 145, is the same except that _tamen_\r\nprecedes _potest_, and that the words _minor britannia maiori comparari\r\net immo bene_ are omitted, evidently by the mistake of a copyist who\r\nhas jumped from one _minor_ to the next _minor_ and thus inadvertently\r\nomitted the intervening words.\r\n\r\n[1399] XV, 28.\r\n\r\n[1400] XV, 80.\r\n\r\n[1401] XV, 152.\r\n\r\n[1402] XV, 14.\r\n\r\n[1403] XV, 172.\r\n\r\n[1404] XVI, 41.\r\n\r\n[1405] _Etymol._, XVI, 7.\r\n\r\n[1406] V.

He used some Frankfurt edition of the\r\n_De proprietatibus rerum_ for which he gives no date, and he usually\r\nfails to state what chapter of Bartholomew he is citing, but refers to\r\nhim simply by the letter B. Also he fails to note that the first two\r\nstones listed by Arnold, namely, _abeston_ (asbestos) and _absictus_\r\n(_apsyctos_) are both in Bartholomew, and what is more, are spelled\r\nexactly the same by both authors. Nor are these the only gems that Rose\r\nfails to note are treated of by both authors. Others are _alabandina_,\r\n_calcofanus_ (which Bartholomew begins with a k), _virites_ or\r\n_pyrites_ (also spelled a little differently in Bartholomew), and\r\n_turcois_ (_De turchoge_ in Bartholomew). In the first three of these\r\nfour passages Arnold’s statements sound like a bald and abbreviated\r\ncopy of Bartholomew’s description.\r\n\r\n[1411] John of Damascus, who wrote on theology, dialectic, and so forth\r\nin the first half of the eighth century (works in Migne, PG vols.\r\n94-96) became well known to western writers through the twelfth century\r\ntranslation of him by Burgundio of Pisa. Some of the works ascribed to\r\nhim are probably spurious, but “his undoubted works are numerous and\r\nembrace a wide range.” A chapter is devoted to the introduction of his\r\nwritings into western Europe in J. de Ghellinck, S. J., _Le Mouvement\r\nthéologique du XIIe siècle, Études, Recherches, et Documents_, Paris,\r\n1914; see EHR (1915), p. 112.

The\r\n Perspective or Optics of Witelo.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Chief sources for Robert Grosseteste.]\r\n\r\nThe fame of Robert Grosseteste,[1421] who lived from about 1175 to 1253\r\nand was bishop of Lincoln during the last eighteen years of his life,\r\nrests largely upon the praises of his countrymen and contemporaries,\r\nMatthew Paris and Roger Bacon, and upon his own writings. The\r\nhistorian, Matthew Paris, depicts him especially as the man of affairs,\r\nthe churchman and statesman who dared oppose either king or pope for\r\nEngland’s sake. But with his repeated resistance in parliament to\r\nroyal financial exactions, his outspokenness against abuses at the\r\npapal court and his refusal to admit papal provisors to benefices in\r\nhis diocese, his aggressive and reforming activity in his bishopric\r\nand consequent quarrels with the monastic orders and his own cathedral\r\nchapter--with all this side of his career we are little concerned. It\r\nis rather as a great scholar of his time that like Roger Bacon we shall\r\nlook back upon him.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Reasons for Roger Bacon’s eulogy.]\r\n\r\nBacon’s eulogies of Grosseteste may seem rather extravagant. Writing\r\nfourteen years after his death he thinks that no living scholar can\r\ncompare with him, nay, he ranks him and Adam Marsh, another Englishman\r\nof whom we know little, as in their day what Solomon, Aristotle and\r\nAvicenna were in theirs.[1422] One reason for this high praise is\r\npresumably that Grosseteste had been Bacon’s favorite teacher, and\r\ncertainly that he was interested in the same learned pursuits, Greek\r\nand Hebrew, mathematics, optics, experimental science, as the friar\r\nwho followed him. Roger practically admits that he owes much in those\r\nfields to Robert and an examination of Grosseteste’s writings makes\r\nthis fact still more evident.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Grosseteste’s scholarly career.]\r\n\r\nA letter by Giraldus Cambrensis written before the close of the twelfth\r\ncentury speaks of the then youthful Grosseteste as already proficient\r\nin law and medicine. He seems to have been born of humble and poor\r\nparents at Stradbrook in Suffolk.[1423] He was educated at Oxford where\r\nhe became _rector scholarum_ and Chancellor and in 1224 the first\r\nrector of the Franciscans at Oxford. He perhaps also studied at Paris.\r\nAfter holding various archdeaconries and other prebends he was elected\r\nbishop of Lincoln in 1235 but continued his interest in the welfare of\r\nthe university at Oxford. Roger Bacon, in affirming that Grosseteste\r\nsurpassed all others in knowledge of the sciences, gives as a reason\r\nhis long life and experience as well as his enthusiasm for study;[1424]\r\nand in another passage declares that hitherto it has taken thirty or\r\nforty years for a man to become really proficient in mathematics, as\r\nthe case of Robert Grosseteste among others shows.[1425] Bacon also\r\nstates that it was not “until the latter portion of his life” that he\r\nundertook the work of making translations and summoned Greeks and had\r\ngrammars brought from Greece and other lands. Since Grosseteste appears\r\nat first to have studied law and medicine rather than ancient languages\r\nand mathematical sciences, Bacon’s statements suggest that the works of\r\nGrosseteste which we are about to consider were written late in life.\r\nThis inference is further borne out by a passage in the treatise _De\r\nimpressionibus aeris seu de prognosticatione_ which gives the positions\r\nof the seven planets in the signs of the zodiac and states the date as\r\n“the Arabic year 646 or the year of grace 1249.”[1426]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: His writings: absence of magic.]\r\n\r\nOur discussion of Grosseteste will be based upon some treatises\r\nincluded in Baur’s edition of his philosophical works. They are mostly\r\nbrief and in some cases seem rather fragmentary. We shall not be\r\nconcerned with his Greek grammar or with his theological writings,\r\nwhich occupy half of the bibliography in Pegge’s Life.[1427] His\r\nletters contain some hints of his scientific works but nothing bearing\r\non magic or astrology. It used to be stated that Grosseteste certainly\r\nconstructed charms to expel maladies, that he invented forms of words\r\nto exorcise fiends, and that he worked cures by engraved gems.[1428]\r\nThe ascription to Grosseteste of treatises on Necromancy and Sorcery,\r\nand the Philosopher’s Stone, is, however, false and grew, Baur says,\r\nfrom marginal glosses appended to one of his genuine works.[1429] What\r\nwe shall note in Grosseteste’s works will be mainly his attitude to\r\nexperimental science on the one hand and to astrology on the other.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Scientific writings little affected by his ecclesiastical\r\nposition.]\r\n\r\nIn these scientific treatises by Grosseteste there is little to suggest\r\nthe Christian bishop. However, in the work “On the Fixity of Motion and\r\nTime” he opposes the Aristotelian doctrine that the universe or motion\r\nof the celestial bodies is eternal.[1430] And in a second treatise, “On\r\nthe Order of the Emanation of Things Caused from God,” he expresses the\r\nwish that men would cease to question the scriptural account of the age\r\nand beginning of the world.[1431] A third treatise “On Freedom of the\r\nWill” also lies on the frontier of philosophy and theology.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Reliance on experience.]\r\n\r\nGrosseteste affords us further examples in a number of passages of\r\nthat reliance upon experience and reason, that rejection of certain\r\nviews as contrary to experience, and yet that acceptance of statements\r\nin old authors as based upon experience, which we saw in Galen and\r\nWilliam of Auvergne’s “experimental books,” and shall see in Albertus\r\nMagnus and the other medieval scientists. Grosseteste speaks, however,\r\nnot merely of experience or _experimenta_, but also of experimenters\r\n(_experimentatores_).[1432] We may first note some use of observation\r\nand experience in astronomy and geography. In his treatise on comets\r\nhe alludes to “experience in natural things.”[1433] In his treatise\r\non the Sphere[1434] Bishop Robert declares that the sphericity of\r\nthe earth and of all the stars and planets “is shown both by natural\r\nreasons and astronomical experiences,” that is, in the case of the\r\nearth, by the observations of the sky by men in different parts of\r\nthe earth. In the same work he says that Thabit ben Corra (836-901\r\nA. D.) working over the operations of Ptolemy, “found by certain\r\nexperiments that the motion of the fixed stars was different.”[1435]\r\nLikewise in his treatise _On the Generation of the Stars_ Grosseteste\r\nremarks of one contention that “experience shows the contrary” and of\r\nanother view that it “is against both experience and reason.”[1436]\r\nAgain in writing _Of the Nature of Places_ he adduces in support of\r\nhis positions “experiments and reasons,” and “divers authors and\r\nexperimenters.”[1437] The old legend of the Hyperboreans who dwell\r\namong mountains near the pole in such a salubrious and temperate\r\nclimate that they live on and on until they tire of life and commit\r\nvoluntary suicide by leaping off cliffs into the sea, Grosseteste\r\nintroduces by the statement: “It has also been found by experience, as\r\nauthors tell”--among whom he names Pliny, Solinus, and “Marcianus in\r\nhis geometry.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Theory of vision and science of perspective.]\r\n\r\nIn the realm of physics Grosseteste not only mentions experience in\r\ndiscussing vision and what he calls Perspective but also brings to\r\nour notice a recent or approaching experimental discovery, that of\r\nmagnifying lenses. In his treatise on the rainbow he makes a rather\r\nunpromising beginning. After arguing whether the sense of sight\r\noperates by the eye receiving something within itself, as natural\r\nphilosophers are prone to hold, or by sending forth a visual species\r\nor rays, he decides as was usual with men of his time in favor of\r\nthe latter alternative.[1438] He cites Aristotle in his last book on\r\nanimals as saying that a man with deep-set eyes sees farther because\r\nhis visual virtue is not spread or scattered but goes straight--as if\r\nfrom a long-barreled gun--to the things seen.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Experimental discovery of lenses.]\r\n\r\nGrosseteste then goes on to say that there are three parts of\r\nPerspective. The first is that concerning the sight with which he has\r\njust been dealing. The second concerns mirrors. The third has been\r\n“untouched and unknown among us until the present time. Yet we know\r\nthat Aristotle completed this third part”--he of course did nothing\r\nof the sort--“and that it is much more difficult in its subtlety and\r\nfar more wonderful in its profound knowledge of natures than the\r\nother parts. For this branch of Perspective thoroughly known shows us\r\nhow to make things very far off seem very close at hand and how to\r\nmake large objects which are near seem tiny and how to make distant\r\nobjects appear as large as we choose, so that it is possible for us\r\nto read the smallest letters at an incredible distance, or to count\r\nsand or grain or grass or any other minute objects.”[1439] So far the\r\npassage reads as if it might be merely the exaggerated dream of fancy.\r\nBut Grosseteste proceeds to state “how these marvels happen,” which\r\nseems to be by the breaking up of “the visual ray”--or as we should\r\nsay, by the refraction of rays of light--as it passes through several\r\ntransparent objects or lenses of varying nature. He explains also that\r\ngreat distance does not make an object invisible but the narrowness of\r\nthe angle under which it is seen.[1440] This he proceeds to illustrate\r\n“by experiments” (_per experimenta_). Again in his treatise on comets\r\nhe mentions “those who have experienced that by a transparent figure\r\ninterposed between the spectator and the object seen it is possible\r\nthat the thing seen should be multiplied and that great things seem\r\nsmall and conversely according to the shape given the interposed\r\ntransparent object.”[1441] I have given as far as possible a literal\r\ntranslation of Grosseteste’s words on this point in order to convey his\r\nexact or inexact meaning. If these passages are not a sufficient proof\r\nthat magnifying lenses of some sort were already discovered, they at\r\nleast point the way to the microscope and telescope, and we know that\r\neye-glasses for nearsightedness were in use at the latest by the end\r\nof the thirteenth century.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mentioned also in _The Romance of the Rose_.]\r\n\r\nVery similar and perhaps copied from this very treatise of Grosseteste\r\non the rainbow--or from its source (Al-Hazen)--are some verses in the\r\ncontinuation of the French _Romance of the Rose_ written by Jean de\r\nMeun, probably about 1270. Besides remarking of rainbows that--the\r\nwords are Ellis’ translation--[1442]\r\n\r\n    “Only he who’s learned the rule\r\n    Of optics in some famous school\r\n    Can to his fellow men explain\r\n    How ’tis that from the sun they gain\r\n    Their glorious hues;”\r\n\r\nthe poet mentions burning-glasses and various types of mirrors, and\r\nalso tells us that from optics one\r\n\r\n    “... may learn the cause\r\n    Why mirrors, through some subtle laws\r\n    Have power to objects seen therein--\r\n    Atoms minute or letters thin--\r\n    To give appearance of fair size,\r\n    Though naked unassisted eyes\r\n    Can scarce perceive them. Grains of sand\r\n    Seem stones when through these glasses scanned.”\r\n\r\nThe poet adds that by these glasses one can read letters from such a\r\ndistance that one would not believe it unless he had seen it. Then he\r\nconcludes:\r\n\r\n    “But to these matters blind affiance\r\n    No man need give; they’re proved by science.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Theories formed by experimenters with lenses.]\r\n\r\nReturning to Grosseteste and experimental method we may note his\r\nmention in the same treatise upon comets of “those who reflect and\r\nexperiment in natural phenomena and form their opinions from their\r\nexperiments without foundation of reasons.”[1443] Grosseteste holds\r\nthat such experimenters “necessarily fall into false notions concerning\r\nthe natures of comets,” because they try to explain them as reflected\r\nrays and the like after the analogy “of their varied experiments which\r\nthey have employed in radiations and the producing of fires”--probably\r\nby burning glasses--“and by what is seen through the medium of lenses”\r\n(_diaphanorum_). The important point for us, however, is not whether\r\nthese men were wrong about comets, but their varied experimentation and\r\ntheir basing of hypothesis upon their experiments.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mathematical physics: the radiation of virtue.]\r\n\r\nIn view of Grosseteste’s interest in physical and astronomical matters,\r\nand his training, if we believe Bacon, for some thirty or forty years\r\nin mathematics, it is not surprising that he realized something of the\r\nvalue of mathematics in the study of natural science. He believed that\r\na knowledge of geometry was of great aid to the “diligent investigator\r\nof natural phenomena” in explaining the causes of all natural effects.\r\nIn a treatise “On lines, angles and figures,” or “On refraction and\r\nreflexion of rays,” Grosseteste holds that not only vision or light\r\nbut every natural agent sends forth its virtue to the object affected\r\nand acts upon sense or matter along geometrical lines.[1444] This\r\ndoctrine of radiation or emanation of force seems to date back at\r\nleast to Plotinus, and we have heard Alkindi among the Arabs in his\r\ntreatise on Stellar Rays say that the stars and all objects in the\r\nworld of the four elements emit rays of this sort. From any given agent\r\nvirtue radiates forth in all directions, but a perpendicular line is\r\nthe shortest and strongest line of force between it and any other\r\nsingle point or object. From a point or center of influence to a larger\r\nsurface we get pyramids or cones of radiated force. The same theory is\r\nset forth by Roger Bacon under the name “multiplication of species”\r\nbut even this wording is not new with him, since Grosseteste speaks of\r\nthe natural agent as “multiplying its virtue” from itself to the thing\r\naffected, and then explains that this virtue is also sometimes called\r\n“species” and sometimes “similitude” and is the same in whatever way\r\nit is named.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The _Computus_ and calendar reform.]\r\n\r\nThe _Computus_, or treatise on reckoning time and keeping track of\r\nEaster especially and also other church festivals, had been a variety\r\nof mathematical and astronomical exercise indulged in by the clergy\r\neven in the darkest periods of the early middle ages. The _Computus_ of\r\nGrosseteste pointed out the need of reforming the Julian calendar then\r\nin use, and he also called attention to this need in his treatise on\r\n_The Sphere_. From the later use made of it by Roger Bacon[1445] and by\r\nCardinal Pierre d’Ailly[1446] in the early fifteenth century one infers\r\nthat Grosseteste’s _Computus_ remained an authoritative work upon the\r\nsubject of calendar reform.[1447]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Juggling with numbers.]\r\n\r\nOn one occasion at least Grosseteste’s interest in mathematics\r\ndegenerated into one of those puerile reveries on the relations\r\nand perfection of certain numbers in which so many authors since\r\nPythagoras, if not before him, had indulged. Having stated that in “the\r\nsupreme body” there are four things, namely, form, matter, composition\r\nand compound, Grosseteste states that form is represented by the\r\nnumber one, matter by two, and composition by three, “since there is\r\npatent in it formed matter and materialized form and the property of\r\ncomposition itself.”[1448] The compound besides these three things has\r\nits own nature and so is represented by four. Now 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10.\r\n“Wherefore every whole and perfect thing is ten.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: From mathematics to astronomy to astrology.]\r\n\r\nThat Grosseteste’s “mathematics” includes astronomy is indicated by\r\nhis citing “_mathematicos_” as explaining that the sun burns the\r\nregions under the tropic of capricorn more than those under the tropic\r\nof cancer, because an eccentric of the sun when it is in capricorn\r\nbrings it closer to the earth.[1449] These mathematicians disagree on\r\nthis point with the commentator upon Aristotle who believed that the\r\nsun burned more in Cancer. If for Grosseteste mathematics included\r\nastronomy, astronomy also included astrology--although he does not\r\nusually employ the word _mathematicus_ for an astrologer. To his\r\nattitude toward astrology we now turn.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Astrology in natural philosophy, agriculture, alchemy,\r\nmedicine and music.]\r\n\r\nGrosseteste accepts astronomy or astrology as the supreme science\r\nand says in his treatise on the liberal arts that natural philosophy\r\nneeds its aid more than that of the others.[1450] There is scarcely\r\nany operation whether of nature or of man, such as the planting of\r\nvegetables, or transmutation of minerals, or cure of diseases, which\r\ncan dispense with astronomical assistance. For inferior nature does\r\nnot act except as celestial virtue moves and directs it. He then goes\r\non to detail the effects of the moon, Saturn, and Mars on the hour\r\nof planting, and then to emphasize the importance of selecting the\r\nfavorable hours astrologically in medical practice and in alchemy where\r\nhe associates the seven planets with seven metals.[1451] He also argues\r\nthat the harmony of the movements of the celestial spheres is found\r\nalso in their effects upon the inferior world.[1452] Therefore he who\r\nknows the due proportion of the elements in the human body and the\r\nconcord of the soul with the body, can restore any lack of harmony in\r\nthe same to its proper state.[1453] In other words, diseases and even\r\nwounds and deafness should be curable by music based upon a knowledge\r\nof astrology and mathematics, and one should also be able to control\r\nsuch emotions as joy, grief, and wrath.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Some astrological technical detail.]\r\n\r\nIn another treatise on how to predict the weather (_De impressionibus\r\naeris seu de prognosticatione_[1454]) Grosseteste says that one must\r\nknow such things as the powers of the signs and the natures of the\r\nplanets.[1455] He then relates the four elements and four qualities\r\nto the planets and signs and proceeds to such further technical\r\nastrological terms as house, exaltation, _triplicitas_, _terminus_,\r\n_facies_, and aspect, and to an explanation of the effect of the\r\neccentrics of the sun and moon upon inferior objects.[1456]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Man and the stars.]\r\n\r\nGrosseteste, like most of our Christian authors, exempts man in part\r\nby virtue of his free will and rational soul from the control of the\r\nstars. One of his brief fragments is entitled “That man is a microcosm”\r\n(_Quod homo sit minor mundus_), that is, a replica of the surrounding\r\nuniverse.[1457] One of his arguments for the finiteness of this world\r\nand of the stars is that all things are made for man and that when he\r\nno longer requires the processes of generation and corruption which\r\nthe movements of the heavens cause, the heaven itself will cease to\r\nmove and time will be no more.[1458] In a treatise on freedom of the\r\nwill, he follows Augustine in _The City of God_ in affirming that the\r\nrational soul is sublimer than the stars and in denying that all our\r\nactions which seem to be freely willed by us are predictable from the\r\nconstellations, and that fate prevails as a necessity in all inferiors\r\nfrom the motion of the stars. He admits, however, that the human body\r\nis subject to two forces; as part of the world of cause it is changed\r\nin many ways by the movements of the stars, but it also is subject to\r\nthe control of the mind especially in voluntary actions.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Grosseteste’s theory of comets.]\r\n\r\nGrosseteste has an ingenious theory which I do not remember having met\r\nelsewhere to explain why comets are signs of great disasters. In his\r\ntreatise on comets he states that a comet is sublimated fire which has\r\nbeen separated from terrestrial nature and assimilated to celestial\r\nnature.[1459] The cause of this separation and assimilation by which\r\ncomets are generated is the virtue of the heavenly bodies. Moreover,\r\neach comet has a particular star of its own which draws it as iron is\r\ndrawn by adamant. This star, even if it is one of the fixed stars, must\r\nbe related to one of the planets and hence the comet is under some\r\nplanet also. Grosseteste then further explains that in every earthly\r\nobject there are incorporated through the action of the celestial\r\nbodies particles of a more spiritual sort assimilated to the celestial\r\nnatures. The generation of a comet, a process in which these fiery or\r\nethereal particles are released from matter and carried up on high,\r\nis therefore the first step and sign of a more general release of the\r\nspiritual nature and of the consequent corruption of the terrestrial\r\nobjects and compounds concerned, namely: in the first place, those\r\nunder the rule of the same planet as the comet in question, and,\r\nin the second place, those in the region from which the comet was\r\nsublimated.[1460] But it is not easy to discern over which region the\r\ncomet has especial significance of all those regions which are under\r\nthe same parallel in which it appears, unless, concludes Grosseteste\r\nnaïvely, it is that region where men are most alarmed by it.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Alchemy.]\r\n\r\nGrosseteste makes one or two incidental allusions to alchemy which\r\nshow that he was a believer in the possibility of transmuting metals.\r\nHe avers that nature intended that all metals should be gold, and that\r\nthey vary from it only by degrees of imperfection.[1461] In another\r\npassage[1462] he mentions a theory of “the doctors of alchemy” that\r\nin each natural object there is, besides the four elements composing\r\nit, a fifth essence, unchangeable in itself but alterable after it has\r\ndescended into inferior bodies. Here again we find a connection between\r\nalchemy and astrology.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Other treatises.]\r\n\r\nIt is probable that not all of Grosseteste’s astrological writings are\r\nincluded in Baur’s edition. He mentions but does not publish a Digby\r\nmanuscript and another of the thirteenth century in the Bibliothèque\r\nNationale. Both are astronomical or astrological.[1463] A fourteenth\r\ncentury manuscript in the British Museum contains a treatise of\r\n“Grosthede” on the medicinal virtues of herbs.[1464] After the name of\r\neach herb the word “Grosthede” is usually added as if the items were\r\nextracts from a larger work. The treatise is not included in Baur’s\r\nedition and is perhaps spurious.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Summa philosophiae_ ascribed to Grosseteste.]\r\n\r\nBaur includes in his edition of Grosseteste’s philosophical works\r\na _Summa philosophiae_ which is longer than the other scientific\r\ntreatises put together but which is probably spurious. The latest\r\nauthors whom it cites are Alexander of Hales who died before\r\nGrosseteste and Albertus Magnus who possibly had written many of his\r\nworks and made his reputation before 1253 although he lived on until\r\n1280. Its several mentions of Albert are much more likely, however,\r\nto have been penned by some younger man than Grosseteste.[1465] And\r\nunless a passage referring to the death of Simon de Montfort after the\r\nappearance of a comet in 1264[1466] is an interpolation, the _Summa_\r\ncannot be by Grosseteste, unless in the sense that it represents his\r\nteaching or is an incomplete work of his to which someone else later\r\nput the finishing touches.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Its contents.]\r\n\r\nThe _Summa_ is, like the encyclopedias of Bartholomew of England and\r\nThomas of Cantimpré, in nineteen books,[1467] a number perhaps chosen\r\nin deference to the seven planets and twelve signs of the zodiac. These\r\nbooks are devoted to the following topics: 1. the rise of philosophy;\r\n2. truth; 3. science; 4. matter; 5. form; 6. virtue; 7. the first\r\ncause; 8. the universe--one but not eternal; 9. bodies, space, and\r\nvacuum; 10. intelligence and intelligences; 11. the rational soul;\r\n12. the sensitive soul; 13. the vegetative soul; 14. light; 15. the\r\nsphere or heavens; 16. nature, universal and particular, and natural\r\nvirtue; 17. elements and compounds; 18. meteorology; 19. minerals and\r\nmetals.[1468]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Oriental origin of philosophy.]\r\n\r\nThe account of the rise of philosophy includes considerable mention\r\nof occult sciences, with which it would seem to have been closely\r\nassociated from the first.[1469] The Chaldeans are called the first\r\nfamous philosophers. Sem is regarded as the founder of astrology and\r\nCham, whom some identify with Zoroaster, is said to have invented the\r\nseven liberal arts. Abraham’s instruction of the Egyptians in astrology\r\nand arithmetic is next mentioned and then Atlas and his nephew Mercury,\r\nand the latter’s grandson Trismegistus, of the same name, are spoken\r\nof. This second Mercurius Trismegistus was according to Albumasar an\r\nillustrious astrologer, pre-eminent in theology and alchemy and magic\r\nand a famous prophet, but according to Augustine he was very worthless\r\n(_vanissimus_) in many respects. Long after this Homer revealed\r\nphilosophy in his stories and Solomon philosophized concerning the\r\nnature of vegetables and animals, but in parables, it is believed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Greek men of learning.]\r\n\r\nAfter mention of Abrachys, the astrologer of King Nebuchadnezzar,\r\nthe author then lists the Greek philosophers from Thales to\r\nSocrates.[1470] The first philosopher in Italy was Pythagoras who\r\nhad been thoroughly instructed in the science of the stars and magic\r\nby the Persians, Chaldeans and Egyptians. In less than a page a good\r\nestimate and contrast of Plato and Aristotle is made,[1471] and the\r\nauthor tries to explain why until the time of Arabic culture Plato\r\nwas almost universally preferred to Aristotle among the Greeks and\r\nLatins. There follows a list of the learned Greeks: Empedocles,\r\nHeraclitus, Hippocrates, Euclid, Archimedes, and various orators,\r\nastronomers, astrologers, and naturalists (_naturales_) concluding with\r\n“Callisthenes the famous alchemist.”[1472]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Arabs and medieval Christians.]\r\n\r\nAmong the Arabs three groups are distinguished of philosophers,\r\n_mathematici_ or astrologers--among whom we are amazed to find Julius\r\nFirmicus listed, and medical writers.[1473] Thebit also is classed with\r\nthe Arabs, but Plato of Tivoli, Costa ben Luca, Algazel, Gundissalinus,\r\nConstantinus, Theophilus Macer, and Philaretus are distinguished as\r\nChristian, and both Rabbi Moses as Hebrews.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ancient and modern science compared.]\r\n\r\nApproaching his own time the author says that there are many other\r\nmen whose excellent works of philosophy he has inspected but of whose\r\nnames he is ignorant or has his reasons for keeping silent about.[1474]\r\nHe does, however, name John the Peripatetic and Alfred, and still\r\nmore recently Alexander the Minorite and Albert of Cologne, the\r\nfriar preacher, as eminent philosophers and yet not to be considered\r\nauthorities. The author nevertheless has no uncritical veneration for\r\nthe learned men of the past. He thinks that with the exception of the\r\nPeripatetics very few of them had a complete or correct knowledge of\r\nthe principles of nature and causes of natural phenomena or concerning\r\nthe transmutation of the elements and the composition of physical\r\nbodies.[1475] Compared with moderns he finds their comprehension\r\nslight, except as they had fewer problems to occupy them and got\r\nresults by concentrating for a long time on these. But he can think of\r\nno one among them except Boethius who was not guilty of some erroneous\r\nopinion. This attitude, however, is perhaps more owing to Christian\r\nprejudice than scientific superiority on our author’s part.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Criticism of Aristotle and the Arabic text.]\r\n\r\nEven Aristotle does not escape criticism. We are told that we should\r\nnot accept his statement concerning the number of movers of the\r\nheavenly spheres, for, as Avicenna and Rabbi Moses have pointed out,\r\nthe science of astronomy was little developed in his time.[1476] Nor\r\nare the Arabian commentators upon Aristotle left uncensured. It is said\r\nthat some of the works of Aristotle in their present form smack more\r\nof Arabic loquacity than of Greek eloquence or the Aristotelian style,\r\nand that, especially in the Arabic text, interpolations and additions\r\nand alterations have been made involving patent anachronisms. Probably\r\nthere have also been corresponding omissions.[1477] These criticisms of\r\nthe Arabic text of Aristotle remind us of those which Roger Bacon said\r\nGrosseteste made.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Use of the word “modern.”]\r\n\r\nThe author of this _Summa_ is quite fond of employing the word “modern”\r\nwhich we heard him use above. He also tells how “Ptolemy, and other\r\nmore modern _mathematici_” introduce epicycles in the orbits of the\r\nplanets to save appearances, but have not fully determined “whether\r\nit is really so.”[1478] He also speaks of “Avenalpetras and the more\r\nmodern Arabs” and calls Albertus Magnus “the most famous of the more\r\nmodern theologians.”[1479]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Theology, philosophy, and science; speculative and\r\nexperimental.]\r\n\r\nIt is rather outside the limits of our investigation, but I cannot\r\nrefrain from noting the _Summa’s_ division of theologians into three\r\nclasses: first, those who are original and have been made saints by\r\nthe pope; second, those who are original and have not been sainted;\r\nthird, the unoriginal minds who compile _Summae_ from the works of\r\nthe other two classes.[1480] The author believes that theology may\r\nutilize philosophy to refute heretics but that it must beware of making\r\nphilosophy its chief end and should use theological terms as far as\r\nit can.[1481] Later he states that there are eight celestial spheres,\r\naccording to the philosophers, nine according to the theologians who\r\ninclude the waters above the firmament as one.[1482] The author divides\r\nscience into theoretical or speculative and practical or operative.\r\nHe also has a touch of experimental science, asserting that very many\r\nexperiences have proved that water will harden into stone,[1483] that\r\nthe rules of genethlialogy and the predictions of astrologers are based\r\nupon the many specific cases observed and classified from experience\r\nby past astrologers,[1484] that many experiences in his own age--some\r\nof which he presently mentions--have shown that terrible events always\r\nfollow the appearance of a comet,[1485] and that the alchemists had\r\nlearned from many experiments that metals can be transmuted.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Astrology.]\r\n\r\nThis favoring attitude toward astrology and alchemy is about all that\r\nthere is left for us to notice in the _Summa_. The author thinks\r\nthat no one has ever adequately treated the virtues appropriate to\r\neach planet, but quotes Rabbi Moses and Albumasar somewhat on this\r\npoint.[1486] He has no difficulty in believing simultaneously in\r\nfreedom of the will and genethlialogy.[1487] He also cites the passage\r\nin Albumasar concerning the astrological prediction of the virgin birth\r\nof Jesus Christ.[1488] In discussing comets, instead of attempting\r\nto explain their signifying disaster to whole regions naturally, as\r\nwe heard Grosseteste do in his treatise on comets, the author of the\r\n_Summa_ holds that “they appear of necessity by the will of God alone,\r\nnot by chance or nature, but by the ministry of intelligences.”[1489]\r\nThis was also the case with the star seen at Christ’s nativity. It\r\nmay be, however, that this entire passage about comets and other\r\nastrological matters is an interpolation in the _Summa_, since it is in\r\nit that the mention of the date 1264 occurs to which we before alluded.\r\nThe writer then goes on to say that his master, who was “most skilled\r\nin natural and mathematical science and most perfect in theology and\r\nmost holy in life and religion,” taught him that Noah’s flood was\r\nnecessitated by a constellation which God had foreordained for the\r\nwickedness of the then world.[1490] This, too, is perhaps a sign of an\r\naddition by some disciple of Grosseteste.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Occult virtue and alchemy.]\r\n\r\nThe author of the _Summa_ believes in occult virtue in nature and\r\nattributes it to the stars.[1491] He accepts Albertus Magnus’s\r\nexplanation of the marvelous virtues of gems as due to celestial\r\ninfluence.[1492] He believes that metals are generated in the earth by\r\nthe same force and are seven in number according to the seven planets,\r\nand thinks that this process can be simulated by alchemy.[1493] In\r\ndiscussing that subject Hermes is his chief authority. The _Summa_\r\nterminates by explaining the superiority of steel to iron and listing\r\nvarious salts.[1494]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Brother Giles on the comet of 1264.]\r\n\r\nSince we have mentioned the comet of 1264, we may note farther that\r\nit was the occasion of a treatise by Brother Giles of the Order of\r\nDominicans, on the essence, motion, and signification of comets,[1495]\r\nin which he cites Grosseteste _De iudiciis_ and alludes to the death of\r\nPope Urban IV in that year. The comet was seen in the kingdom of France\r\nfrom mid-July to October and “stupefied the minds of many.”\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1421] References to Grosseteste’s works, unless otherwise stated, will\r\nbe to Ludwig Baur, _Die Philosophischen Werke des Robert Grosseteste_,\r\nMünster, 1912, in Baeumker’s _Beiträge zur Geschichte der Philosophie\r\ndes Mittelalters_, Vol. IX. This edition seems to make little effort to\r\ncorrect errors of case or number in the MSS, so that much of the text\r\nis far from being smooth reading. Baur discussed _Die Philosophie des\r\nRobert Grosseteste_ in Vol. XVIII (1917) of the same series. The life\r\nof Grosseteste is treated briefly in DNB, and more fully in the old\r\nand pedantic work of Samuel Pegge, _The Life of Robert Grosseteste_,\r\nLondon, 1793, 385 quarto pages with many foot-notes and appendices,\r\nwhich however are based mainly on the works of preceding antiquaries,\r\nthe author stating in his preface, “my private station as a country\r\nclergyman would not permit me to have much access to public libraries,\r\nbut the materials were chiefly to be sought for in a book-room which,\r\nyou will easily suppose, cannot be very richly or amply furnished.”\r\nPegge’s Life was already described in 1861 as “one of the scarcest\r\nof modern works”; but the British Museum possesses two copies. Other\r\nbiographies are by J. Felten, Freiburg, 1887, and F. Stevenson, London,\r\n1889. The letters of Grosseteste, which do not especially concern us,\r\nare edited by H. R. Luard in RS XXV, 1861.\r\n\r\nNot to be confused with Grosseteste is Robertus Anglicus who wrote\r\na commentary on the _Sphere_ of Sacrobosco in 1271, a _Tractatus\r\nquadrantis_ at Montpellier in 1276 (printed 1508), and _Canons for the\r\nAstrolabe_ (printed at Colle about 1478): see Duhem, III (1915), pp.\r\n292, 298.\r\n\r\n[1422] Brewer, 70 and 75.\r\n\r\n[1423] Pegge (1793), p. 8, and Appendix II.\r\n\r\n[1424] Brewer, 91; Bridges, I. 67.\r\n\r\n[1425] Brewer, 472.\r\n\r\n[1426] Baur, 49-50. If, on the other hand, the mention of an Arabic\r\nyear indicates that the treatise is a translation of an Arabic work,\r\nthe date would seem almost too late for Grosseteste to have effected\r\nthe translation.

The\r\nexperimental character of the subject is repeatedly emphasized;[1498]\r\nwe hear much of experimenting with instruments;[1499] and such words as\r\n“experimenter” and “experimentation” are used.[1500] Similar passages,\r\nhowever, are also found in Witelo’s main source, the work of the Arab\r\nAlhazen on the same subject.[1501] But Witelo also encourages his\r\nreaders to go farther and experiment for themselves, assuring them\r\nthat “experience more than books will teach the varied possibilities\r\nof images”[1502] from mirrors, suggesting, “Let then the ingenuity of\r\nmoderns and men of the future add what it shall please,”[1503] and\r\nagain affirming in the case of burning-glasses, “But in experimentation\r\nwith these too there is the greatest latitude which we leave to those\r\nwho are curious in such matters.”[1504]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Occult and astral virtue.]\r\n\r\nWitelo also resembles Grosseteste in his favorable attitude toward\r\nastrology and the conception of the radiation of virtue. Already in his\r\npreface to William of Moerbeke he speaks of that “influence of divine\r\nvirtues which is made in marvelous wise in inferior bodies through the\r\nvirtues of superior bodies,”[1505] of that “divine light” which is “the\r\nsensible medium of corporal influences,”[1506] marvelously assimilating\r\nand connecting inferior bodies with superior bodies, while he compares\r\nthe influence of the celestial constellations upon subject bodies to\r\nthe process of reflection in a mirror.[1507] At the beginning of his\r\ntenth book, stating that the virtues of natural forms increased by\r\nrefraction act more strongly, he adds that universally an increase\r\nof the virtue of the rays of the stars or of other forms at the same\r\nnatural point or about the same point results in stronger action. Such\r\npassages suggest that perspective or optic was studied not only for its\r\nown sake but for its supposed analogy to the operation of occult and\r\nastral virtue. Indeed in his preface he represents William of Moerbeke\r\nas versed in such occult research,[1508] and William translated not\r\nonly astrological treatises but also probably the so-called _Ptolemaei\r\nde speculis_ which is really Hero’s _Catoptrica_. Baeumker believes\r\nthat Witelo for his part was strongly affected by the metaphysical\r\ntheory in favor with the Neo-Platonists and Gnostics of primitive light\r\nas the origin of intelligence, space, and so on.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Marvelous effects.]\r\n\r\nIn Witelo’s work may also be noticed something of that element of\r\nthaumaturgy which we noted in Hero of Alexandria. Thus in his eighth\r\nbook on concave mirrors he speaks of the “marvelous diffusion of\r\nnatural forms and the multiform deception of the visions beheld,” while\r\nin the ninth book on burning glasses we are promised the production\r\nof astonishing effects. But as a rule Witelo’s presentation of his\r\nsubject is geometrical rather than sensational, and his first book, not\r\nparalleled in Alhazen, is a geometry of 137 propositions as a basis\r\nfor the ensuing “universal axioms of this science.” As we have seen,\r\nhowever, Witelo employs the experimental as well as the mathematical\r\nmethod and instruments as well as theorems.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Further characteristics.]\r\n\r\nUnlike Grosseteste, Witelo regards vision by extramission of rays from\r\nthe eye as impossible,[1509] wherein he follows Alhazen. Of magnifying\r\nlenses he seems to display only a theoretical knowledge,[1510] and\r\nto add little to Alhazen on this point and less to Grosseteste. In\r\ngeneral, however, he is believed by collecting the tradition of the\r\npast and filling in the gaps therein to have made the whole subject\r\nclearer to the Latin world and to have produced a work which served for\r\nseveral centuries as an excellent text book in the field of optical\r\nscience.[1511] Its original portion consists especially of observations\r\nmade by the author at Padua and Viterbo,[1512] which latter town was\r\nalso the scene of several of William of Moerbeke’s translations. The\r\nPerspective was probably dedicated to him about 1270.[1513]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1496] I have used the edition of 1572, _Vitellionis Thurinopoloni\r\nOpticae libri decem_, ed. F. Risner, Basel, 1572, where the text of\r\nWitelo, occupying 474 pages, is preceded by a Latin translation of\r\nAlhazen in 288 pages. The chief modern study on Witelo is C.

The _Speculum morale_, once\r\nattributed to him, has been shown to be a later production. The\r\n_Speculum naturale_ may be regarded as capping the series begun with\r\nNeckam’s _De naturis rerum_ and continued by Thomas of Cantimpré’s\r\n_De natura rerum_ and Bartholomew of England’s _De proprietatibus\r\nrerum_. The _Mirror of History_ is a world chronicle written from the\r\nChristian standpoint. The _Mirror of Doctrine_ is not merely concerned\r\nwith doctrine in the theological sense but with all fields of art and\r\nlearning, industry and society, beginning with a discussion of schools\r\nof philosophy and educational method and a dictionary of some 3200\r\nwords, and running through grammar, logic, rhetoric, poetics, monastic\r\nand economic and political institutions, the useful and military arts,\r\nmedicine, physics, and natural philosophy, mathematics and metaphysics,\r\nand finally reaching theology in its seventeenth and last book. Indeed,\r\nVincent himself well described it as concerned with “all arts,” as the\r\nother two Mirrors reflect “all things” and “all times.”[1515] It is\r\nconsiderably briefer than the _Mirror of Nature_ which contains almost\r\ntwice as many books.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Events of his life.]\r\n\r\nLittle is known of Vincent’s life and the years of his birth and death\r\nare uncertain. He speaks of himself as “Vincent of Beauvais of the\r\nOrder of Preachers,” and in 1246 was a sub-prior of the Dominican\r\nmonastery at Beauvais. Like another learned friar of his time, Roger\r\nBacon, he speaks of laborious duties which interrupted his literary\r\nactivities and forced him to employ copyists. Probably the most\r\nimportant external circumstance of his career was his connection with\r\nthe royal family of St. Louis. Although a Dominican, Vincent held\r\nthe post of reader in the Cistercian abbey of Royaumont which Louis\r\nhad founded in 1228. Vincent seems to have served Louis IX in the\r\ntriple capacity of royal librarian, chaplain, and tutor of the king’s\r\nchildren. His treatise _On the Education of the Royal Children_ was\r\ncomposed at some time after the return of St. Louis from the Holy Land\r\nin 1254, and his _Consolatory Letter_ dealt with the death of Prince\r\nLouis in 1260. The date 1264, often mentioned as that of Vincent’s\r\ndeath, rests on the statement of Louis à Valleoleti who wrote in the\r\nearly fifteenth century. Ptolemy of Lucca who wrote a century nearer\r\nto Vincent’s time cites him concerning the three year vacancy in\r\nthe papacy following the death of Clement IV, which would bring the\r\ncompletion of the _Speculum historiale_ down to 1271 at least, but\r\nDaunou showed that this citation was incorrect and that the passage in\r\nquestion was from Martin of Poland, not Vincent of Beauvais. This is\r\nperhaps also the case with another passage in Ptolemy of Lucca which\r\nDaunou failed to note and which says, “Historians in general state,\r\nbut Vincent in particular writes” of a comet which portended the death\r\nof Pope Urban IV in 1264. Although the duration of the comet was three\r\nmonths, the pope sickened as soon as it appeared and died on the very\r\nday that it disappeared.[1516] If the citation is from Vincent, he must\r\nhave lived beyond 1264.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Was the _Speculum naturale_ finished in 1250?]\r\n\r\nIt has been customary to give 1250 as the precise date for the\r\ncompletion of the _Speculum naturale_, because its last book, which\r\nis geographical and historical, states that it will bring the history\r\nof the world down to the present year, 1250. Valentin Rose accepted\r\nthis date so confidently as to argue on the basis of it that, because\r\nVincent did not cite the work of Albertus Magnus on minerals,[1517]\r\nthat treatise was not written until after 1250. But that such\r\nstatements of the current year in Vincent’s works cannot be relied\r\nupon too implicitly is shown in his _Mirror of History_. From the\r\nlist of popes given in its eighth book we should infer that it was\r\ncomposed in 1244 or 1245, since it speaks of Innocent IV as having\r\nnow sat on the throne for two years; and again the closing chapter of\r\nits thirty-first[1518] book states that the author has brought the\r\nhistory of the sixth age of the world down to the current year, that\r\nis, the eighteenth of Louis IX and the second of Innocent IV and\r\nthe thirty-fourth of Frederick II. But other events are mentioned which\r\nhappened in 1250 and 1254.[1519]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Order of the three Mirrors.]\r\n\r\nIt is also difficult to determine the order in which the three Mirrors\r\nwere completed. Daunou assumed that the _Speculum naturale_ was\r\nfinished first, and that the _Speculum doctrinale_ treated again of\r\nsome topics which had already been discussed in the other. He also\r\nplaced the _Speculum historiale_ later than the _Mirror of Nature_,\r\nbelieving that it was published at some time after 1254 rather than\r\nten years earlier, and pointing out that in its ninth book Vincent\r\nmentioned having used Pliny’s _Natural History_ in his _Speculum\r\nnaturale_. On the other hand, the revised edition of Potthast’s\r\n_Wegweiser_ regards the _Mirror of History_ as completed about 1244\r\nbefore the _Mirror of Nature_. As an intermediate work it mentions\r\n_Memoriale omnium temporum_, an extract in eighty chapters made by\r\nVincent himself from the _Speculum historiale_. This extract was then\r\nembodied in the last book of the _Speculum naturale_, where an account\r\nof the years 1242-1250 was added to it. And in the last chapter of\r\nthe _Speculum naturale_, where the coming of antichrist and the last\r\njudgment are discussed, we are told that these matters are more fully\r\ntreated at the close of the _Speculum historiale_. Thus we have both\r\nthe _Mirror of History_ looking back on the _Mirror of Nature_ as an\r\nearlier work, and _vice versa_. Thus we apparently have to do with a\r\nrevised edition of one or both of the works, or with later additions\r\nand interpolations which a study of the manuscripts would be necessary\r\nto unravel, although very likely it would fail to do so. One might\r\nhazard the conjecture that the _Mirror of History_ was first issued\r\nin 1244, as it says, and that this edition was the one cited in the\r\n_Mirror of Nature_; that after 1254 a revised edition of the _Mirror\r\nof History_ was issued and that in this the _Speculum naturale_ was\r\nreferred to. There are further objections even to this view, however,\r\nas we shall presently see.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Chronological relation to Albert and Aquinas.]\r\n\r\nIf the _Speculum naturale_ as we have it was completed by 1250, it\r\nwould aid us in dating works of Albertus Magnus and Aquinas which\r\nit cites. Vincent cites Albert a great deal, especially for the\r\nAristotelian psychology, often without definite mention of the title of\r\nthe work cited, but sometimes such titles are mentioned as _De anima_,\r\n_De sensu et sensato_, _De somno et vigilia_, _De animalibus_.[1520]\r\nEvidently Albert had already completed many of his commentaries upon\r\nand elaborations of the Aristotelian philosophy, and had made an\r\nestablished reputation for himself. It is quite possible that this\r\nhad been already accomplished by 1250, since, while Albert lived on\r\nuntil 1280, he was then an old man. But what is surprising to find\r\nin a work written in 1250 are Vincent’s citations of Thomas Aquinas\r\non such questions as “How an angel instructs the soul?” and “What\r\nprophecy is?”[1521] In 1250 Aquinas would have been only twenty-three\r\nand would scarcely have attained the rank of an authority upon advanced\r\ntheological problems of this sort, since he did not receive his\r\ndoctorate in theology, precocious as he was, until 1257. Either then\r\nthese citations are later interpolations, or Vincent did not complete\r\nthe _Speculum naturale_ in 1250. But this problem again calls for an\r\nexamination of the earliest manuscripts.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: General character of the _Speculum naturale_.]\r\n\r\nThe _Speculum naturale_ may be described as a sort of over-grown\r\n_Hexaemeron_; indeed, in some of the manuscripts it is entitled,\r\n_Speculum in Hexemeron libris 32, ex dictis innumerabilium tam\r\nchristianorum quam gentilium_.[1522] That is to say, its consideration\r\nof nature follows the order of the six days of creation. But the mass\r\nof scientific data is so voluminous as to obscure this underlying\r\nBiblical plan, and the work is divided not into six books, but\r\nthirty-two and a prologue, or thirty-three in all. The work is,\r\nhowever, more marked by a theological aim, tone, and interest than\r\nothers that we have considered or shall consider. This is not quite so\r\nnoticeable as in the _Speculum historiale_, described by Daunou as “a\r\nwork planned and executed in an essentially theological spirit,”[1523]\r\nand one of whose four books on the twelfth century consists entirely of\r\nextracts from the writings of St. Bernard. But as the prologue of the\r\n_Mirror of Nature_ ranks the philosophers and doctors of the Gentiles\r\nas of the third and lowest grade of authority, as its next book\r\ndiscusses the Trinity and angels as well as the universe, and the third\r\ndeals with demons as well as elements and atoms, so its twenty-fourth\r\nbook is largely concerned with the soul and its immortality, the\r\nthirtieth with the seventh day of rest and such topics as fate and\r\nprovidence, sin and penitence, and the thirty-first with Paradise,\r\nthe creation and fall of man, marriage, and so on. We have had other\r\nwriters begin with the Trinity and angels and demons but thereafter\r\ndeal more exclusively with purely physical phenomena. We have seen\r\nother writers start out with the professed object of explaining the\r\nScriptures but end by discussing nature in a purely scientific way.\r\nVincent, on the other hand, sets out to compile a _Mirror of History_\r\nor a _Mirror of Nature_ but cannot keep his mind off such themes as the\r\nfall of man and the last judgment.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Vincent’s method of compilation.]\r\n\r\nVincent also adheres rather more strictly to his professed rôle of a\r\nmere compiler than some of our other medieval writers. He says that he\r\nwill distinguish his own statements by the word _Actor_ or _Auctor_,\r\nauthor or editor, and such passages are of minor importance and make\r\nlittle or no new contribution to scientific knowledge. His superiority\r\nto other medieval compilers or encyclopedists consists almost entirely\r\nin the fact that he has had access to a larger library and has made\r\nlonger and more numerous excerpts from his authorities than they. As a\r\nrule he does not attempt to reconcile conflicting statements in the\r\nauthorities, warning his readers in the prologue that he is a mere\r\nexcerptor and not to be held responsible for such inconsistencies.\r\nIndeed, he is to such an extent a mere excerptor that it is perhaps\r\nmore important to note the authors whom he uses[1524] than the\r\nsubject-matter which he takes from them and which we have already been\r\nover in large measure, since we have already considered separately many\r\nof his main sources.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Use of Pliny and Aristotle.]\r\n\r\nVincent is easily indebted to Pliny, with whose entire _Natural\r\nHistory_ he seems acquainted,[1525] more than to any other single\r\nsource and the _Speculum naturale_ is as much an imitation of it as a\r\ndevelopment from patristic _Hexaemerons_. Another constant reliance\r\nis Isidore, who of course in his turn had used Pliny extensively.\r\nAristotle and various Arabian authorities--Rasis, Avicenna, Albumasar,\r\nAverroes--are frequently cited, but sometimes at least indirectly\r\nthrough Albertus Magnus. In his preface Vincent apologizes for often\r\ngiving Aristotle’s views not in his own words but in transposed order\r\nfor the sake of condensation and clearness. Incidentally he reveals\r\nthat he had the service of assistants in compiling his encyclopedia,\r\nsince he states that he has not made these renditions of Aristotle\r\nhimself but that they have been “excerpted by certain brothers.” At\r\nthe same time he shows how familiar the wording of Aristotle’s text\r\nhad become by his time and how precise the standards of medieval\r\nscholarship were in some respects, when he adds that there are some\r\nscholars who will not tolerate the alteration of one iota or the order\r\nof a single word of the authority.[1526]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: More recent authorities.]\r\n\r\nVincent is also not ashamed “to learn from modern doctors”[1527]\r\nand employs many works of his medieval Latin predecessors from\r\nConstantinus Africanus, whom he cites a great deal as Bartholomew did,\r\nto Albertus Magnus and perhaps Thomas Aquinas. He makes some use of the\r\n_Natural Questions_ of Adelard of Bath, which treatise he once cites\r\nas “_Adelardus ad nepotem_,”[1528] and for matters astronomical he\r\nmakes much use of the _De philosophia_ or _Dragmaticon_ of William of\r\nConches. He also repeats its _locus classicus_ concerning the waters\r\nabove the firmament where the view of Bede is rejected for “the more\r\nprobable opinion of the moderns in this matter.”[1529]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Credulity concerning barnacle birds.]\r\n\r\nWhile Vincent shows a wide and commendable acquaintance not only with\r\na large number of names of authors and titles, but in many cases\r\nwith a part or the whole of the contents of the books themselves,\r\nit sometimes appears that he has not got all that he might have\r\nfrom the authority in question, and he sometimes does not display\r\nthe soundest of judgment in what he includes and what he omits in\r\nmaking his selections. The case of the barnacle birds may serve as an\r\nillustration. Now Vincent cites the work of Albertus Magnus on animals\r\nconcerning falcons in the very same seventeenth book in which this\r\nchapter on the barnacle birds occurs. With his broad bibliographical\r\nattainments Vincent should have realized the worth of Albert’s work\r\nand should have imbibed some of its sceptical and critical attitude\r\ntoward stories of strange and outlandish animals. Albert had branded\r\nas liars those who said that birds were born from trees, hanging from\r\nthe trunk and branches and being nourished by the sap beneath the\r\nbark, or that birds were generated from driftwood at sea, and that\r\nno one had ever seen such birds lay eggs or have sexual intercourse.\r\nAlbert and many of his associates had seen them doing both and feeding\r\ntheir young.[1530] Yet Vincent continues to discuss these barnacle\r\nbirds most credulously. They feed on driftwood. At birth they are\r\nnaked but gradually grow feathers and float through the sea hanging to\r\nthe driftwood by their beaks until they come to maturity and bestir\r\nthemselves and break away. “And we ourselves have seen many of them\r\nand trustworthy men have testified that they have seen them hanging\r\nthus.” Jacques de Vitry tells of them in his _Oriental History_: “It\r\nis further to be noted that they do not hang in the tops of trees but\r\non the bark of the boughs and trunks. And they grow on the sap of the\r\ntree and the infusion of dew until they have feathers and strength and\r\nbreak off from the bark. It may be said with certainty of these birds\r\nthat in our part of the world around Germany they neither generate\r\nby sexual concourse nor are generated. Nor has any man among us ever\r\nseen their sexual congress. Consequently some Christians in our time\r\nin those places where birds of this sort abound are accustomed to eat\r\ntheir flesh in Lent. But Pope Innocent III in the general council at\r\nthe Lateran forbade them to do this any more.”[1531] After stating\r\nthat the barnacle birds eat herbs and grain like geese and cannot go\r\nfor long without drink, Vincent cites a “Philosopher,” but it is not\r\nclear whether as authority for the foregoing statements or the ensuing\r\nassertion that the barnacle bird which is born from trees is found also\r\nin certain parts of Flanders.[1532] “Philosopher” in this case can\r\ntherefore scarcely be Aristotle. Despite what was said of the bird’s\r\nthirst, it is now added that like trees it has no superfluity.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A sign of his scientific inferiority.]\r\n\r\nPerhaps Vincent had read but little of Albert’s work on animals;\r\npossibly the citations of it in the _Speculum naturale_ are later\r\ninterpolations; but in any case the passage suggests a difference in\r\nscientific attitude between the two men. It should be added, however,\r\nin Vincent’s favor that his descriptions of fish were in Cuvier’s\r\nopinion more precise and correct than those of Albert.[1533] But in\r\ngeneral it seems to me that he was neither the personal observer\r\nof nature that Albert was, nor did he possess as much scientific\r\ndiscrimination. This defect is bound to affect his whole selection\r\nof material and use of authorities, and, together with his somewhat\r\nexcessive theological bias, makes his compilation, extensive as it is,\r\nscarcely representative of medieval natural science at its best. At the\r\nsame time we see that in the very process of excerpting he gives his\r\ncompilation a certain character and tone of its own. It will therefore\r\nbe well, in view of its widespread and enduring influence, attested\r\nby numerous manuscripts and printed editions, to give some attention\r\nto its contents, and see what attitude it reflects on the subjects of\r\nmagic, astrology, divination from dreams, and occult virtue in nature.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Demons, magic, and superstition.]\r\n\r\nVincent’s mentions of magic[1534] are incidental to his discussion of\r\ndemons and the marvels, transformations, and divination which they are\r\nable to work. On these points he repeats the views of Augustine, Peter\r\nLombard, and other like-minded ecclesiastical authorities, and we need\r\nnot dwell upon them further, except to note that he makes the demons\r\ninhabit the lower and misty air, and that his citation of _The Golden\r\nAss_ of Apuleius is probably indirect through Augustine. We should\r\nalso note, however, a passage in the _Mirror of Doctrine_[1535] which\r\nseems to be largely derived from the _Summa_ of a “brother William,”\r\nwhich may possibly be the _De universo_ of William of Auvergne,\r\nalthough he does not seem to have been a friar. The passage states that\r\nincantations may be used to enchant the sick or children or animals,\r\nprovided no superstitious practice which the church has prohibited\r\nis involved, and only licit prayers, adjurations, and such symbols as\r\nthe sign of the cross are used. Perhaps the practice of hypnotism is\r\ninvolved here. Vincent believes that men and women who introduce many\r\nuseless and superstitious ceremonies should be forbidden to continue\r\nthese practices, which should be confined to priests and to laymen and\r\nwomen of excellent life and proved discretion. But he does not object\r\nto employment of the divine symbol in plucking an herb or to writing\r\nthe Lord’s prayer on a scroll and placing it near the patient.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Divination from dreams.]\r\n\r\nIn his discussion of dreams and their significance Vincent combines\r\nsuch varied authorities as Aristotle, Avicenna, Albert, Aquinas, and\r\nPope Gregory the Great, who accounted for dreams by a full or empty\r\nstomach, the thoughts of the dreamer, the illusions of demons, and\r\nthe revelations of angels. While recognizing with the Bible that\r\ndreams make many err, Vincent agrees “with the saints and prophets\r\nthat dreams frequently signify something concerning the future.”\r\nDreams are powerfully affected by the motion of the stars in the sky,\r\nwhich is scarcely noticed when we are awake but is manifest in sleep.\r\nDispositions, too, on the part of the sleeper make themselves felt in\r\ndreams which are not observed in waking hours, a medieval statement\r\nof the Freudian theory. Dreams are not causes but simply signs of the\r\nfuture. Since the events which they forecast are not yet in existence,\r\nthey obviously cannot portray them plainly but suggest them obscurely\r\nin a manner requiring interpretation. Thus to dream of fire is a sign\r\nof future anger, to see a great foul mouth in a dream indicates a false\r\ncriminal accusation, to dream of a scorpion portends secret detraction.\r\nIt is commonly stated by philosophers that the signification of a\r\ndream varies as it occurs at the full moon or the new moon or in the\r\nsunshine, and also according to the positions of the planets in the\r\nsigns.[1536]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The stars.]\r\n\r\nFrom the influence of the stars upon dreams we may next turn to\r\nVincent’s attitude toward astrology in general. It is a mixture of\r\npassages from church fathers against the errors of the genethlialogists\r\nand _mathematici_, and of passages from the philosophers, ancient and\r\nrecent, affirming the control of the stars over the world of nature.\r\nVincent, however, attempts to combine and reconcile these, and makes\r\nhis own standpoint fairly evident. He holds that the brief, vague\r\nutterances of Aristotle whence the commentators have inferred that\r\nthe stars are alive do not necessarily imply this.[1537] They are\r\nnevertheless superior in certain ways to all inferior life, and are of\r\nan unalterable and incorruptible nature.[1538] Vincent undertakes to\r\nreconcile the assertion of holy doctors that the heavens neither have\r\nsouls nor are animals with the doctrines of the philosophers.[1539]\r\nHe holds that there are Intelligences in the spheres of the heavens\r\nwho serve the First Cause or Mover and that, although the saints abhor\r\ngiving these the name of souls, yet they concede that intelligences or\r\nangels move the heavens and the stars at the nod of God.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Their influence.]\r\n\r\nFrom sages and men of old Vincent reiterates such doctrine as that\r\n“the movement of the heavens and superior bodies is the cause of all\r\nnatural motions” and of generation and corruption; that there is no\r\nplant on earth which does not have its controlling star; and that\r\n“all things which are renewed in the inferior world, except such as\r\nare caused by the superior form of our reason, have their efficient\r\ncauses in the inalterable and incorruptible superior world.”[1540]\r\nVincent devotes much of his sixteenth book to astrological technique,\r\ndetailing the good and evil qualities of the planets, and describing\r\ntheir houses, exaltations, _triplicitates_, _termini_, _facies_,\r\nand their virtues in the different signs of the zodiac.[1541] Like\r\nBartholomew he also reproduces Constantinus Africanus’ account of the\r\ncontrol by the planets of the formation of the human foetus in the\r\nwomb.[1542] In a later book[1543] he repeats the views of Albumasar and\r\nan unnamed astrologer concerning the influence of the sun and other\r\nplanets in human generation. Against their control of such matters\r\nas sex, however, Vincent cites the authority of Augustine and some\r\nphysiological arguments. He further warns us not to subject human\r\nreason and free will to fatal necessity of the constellations, citing\r\nsuch authorities as Gregory’s homily for epiphany and Chrysostom’s\r\nsixth homily on Matthew anent the Magi and the star, and repeating such\r\ntime-worn and time-honored arguments as the case of Esau and Jacob or\r\nthe fact that in fishless inland provinces men are born under the sign\r\nPisces.[1544] Vincent repeats the general medieval belief that comets\r\nsignify pestilence, famine, or war.[1545] His discussion of Egyptian\r\ndays we have considered elsewhere. He seems to accept the efficacy of\r\nastrological images, repeating the attribution of medicinal virtue and\r\ninfluence on human character to “stones on which you find engraved\r\nAries or Leo or Sagittarius,”[1546] and citing Thetel,[1547] perhaps\r\nindirectly through Thomas of Cantimpré, concerning the virtues of\r\nengraved gems. But to the virtues of gems let us turn.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Virtues of gems.]\r\n\r\nFor the virtues of gems Vincent combines authorities from the\r\nPseudo-Aristotle and Pliny down to Arnold of Saxony and Thomas of\r\nCantimpré. The extreme powers credited to gems by the Magi and Marbod\r\nplay a prominent part in his ninth book. Selecting by lot five[1548]\r\nout of seventy odd chapters we read that the agate averts storms and\r\nthunderbolts, gives victory in war, routs venomous animals, aids\r\nthe sight, slakes the thirst, and promotes fidelity. The _balagius_\r\nstimulates conjugal affection, burns the right hand grasping it,\r\nstrengthens weak eyes if one drinks water in which it has lain,\r\nand protects one against enemies. Coral checks hemorrhage, reduces\r\ncorpulence, draws harmful humors from the eye, cures ulcers, and\r\nbenefits heart, intestines, and spleen. Suspended over the mouth it\r\nstops stomachache; suspended from the neck it prevents epileptic fits.\r\nSuspended from trees or sown with seed it protects the fruit or crops\r\nfrom hail storms. Decayed teeth are filled with it in order to extract\r\nthem, and it is terrible to demons because it is so often found in the\r\nform of the cross. The gem heliotrope makes one invincible in battle\r\nand invisible, if it is combined with the herb of the same name and\r\ncertain incantations. It makes water boil, reddens the sun, prevents\r\nloss of blood, is an antidote to poison, assures its bearer long life,\r\nand aids in prediction of the future.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A chapter on the jasper.]\r\n\r\nThe chapter on the jasper is a good example of Vincent’s method of\r\ncombining excerpts from varied authors. First he cites the monkish\r\nchronicler Helinandus who died in 1227 to the effect that the jasper\r\nworn chastely dispels fever and dropsy, and that application of it aids\r\nchild-birth. The _Lapidary_ of the pseudo-Aristotle repeats this last\r\nassertion and adds that the gem clarifies the human sight and checks\r\nbleeding. Arnold says it makes a man safe and drives away phantasms,\r\nresists luxury, prevents conception, and checks the flow of blood or\r\nthe menstrual discharge. From Pliny we learn that magicians use it\r\nin public assemblies. Philosopher affirms that it renders its wearer\r\nchaste, safe, and agreeable, if it has been consecrated, and that it\r\ndispels noxious phantasms. Thetel is cited concerning the potency of a\r\njasper found inscribed with a man having a shield about his neck or in\r\none hand, a spear in the other, and a snake underfoot. When the image\r\non the gem is that of a man with a bundle of herbs about his neck,\r\nthe stone should be set in silver and it will possess the virtue of\r\ndistinguishing between diseases and checking bleeding. Galen is said\r\nto have worn this stone on his finger, and Rabanus says that it drives\r\naway idle fears. Thus the same properties of the gem are repeated over\r\nand over from the mouths of various authorities.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Alchemy.]\r\n\r\nBefore treating of gems in his ninth book Vincent had discussed\r\nother minerals and metals in the eighth. There he often alludes to\r\nalchemy,[1549] which he regards as a practical art related to the\r\nscience of mineralogy as agriculture is to botany. He also believes\r\nthat “by the art of alchemy mineral bodies are transmuted from their\r\nown species into others, especially metals.”[1550] It is true that the\r\nfourth book of the _Meteorology_ of Aristotle contains the statement\r\nthat artificers cannot alter species but can only make other metals\r\nseem like silver or gold. But some say that this passage is not\r\nAristotle’s but an addition from some other author. Avicenna in the\r\nalchemical treatise _De anima_[1551] represents Aristotle and Plato as\r\nfavorable to alchemy. So Vincent persists in maintaining that, “while\r\nthe aforesaid words make alchemy seem false in a way, yet it has been\r\nproved true both by the ancient philosophers and the artificers of our\r\ntime,” and that “transmutation, or rather disintegration” of metals\r\nis truly effected through alchemy. The baser metals may be reduced to\r\ntheir simplest form and then reformed into more precious metals.[1552]\r\nVincent also devotes some chapters to “the stone, elixir, by which\r\nart imitates nature.”[1553] Avicenna and an unnamed Alchemist seem\r\nto be Vincent’s two chief authorities on the subject of alchemy in\r\nthe _Speculum naturale_. In the _Speculum doctrinale_[1554] he again\r\ndiscussed the subject, this time quoting liberally from a treatise _De\r\naluminibus et salibus_ attributed to Rasis. A separate treatise seems\r\nto have been formed from these chapters of Vincent.[1555] Vincent’s\r\ndiscussion of alchemy has already been reviewed by Berthelot[1556]\r\nwho noted the theories that everything has an occult quality opposed\r\nto its natural one; that four spirits, mercury, sulphur, arsenic, and\r\nsal ammoniac, and six metals, gold, silver, copper, tin, lead, and\r\niron, are generated in the bowels of the earth; and that the metals are\r\ngenerated by mercury and sulphur. The last doctrine in its developed\r\nform Berthelot regarded as not earlier than the twelfth century.\r\nBerthelot was unable to identify the “Alchemist” cited by Vincent. One\r\ncan hardly accept Berthelot’s hypothesis that a work which contains\r\nideas not found in the _Speculum naturale_ is later than the thirteenth\r\ncentury. The _Speculum naturale_ was written, if not by 1250, at least\r\nmany years before the close of the century, and, voluminous as are its\r\nextracts, it is very far from being all-inclusive of the ideas of the\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Virtues of plants.]\r\n\r\nLike Pliny, Vincent devotes much more space to the vegetable than to\r\nthe mineral kingdom.[1557] But the virtues ascribed to plants are much\r\nless marvelous than those credited to stones, and the methods of making\r\nuse of them are seldom superstitious. In this we have, of course, not\r\nmerely Vincent’s attitude; he reflects his sources and conforms to the\r\nusual medieval position. The virtues ascribed to plants are mainly\r\nmedicinal; many are doubtless false, however, and Vincent, with his\r\nvoluminous extracts and citations, magnifies the customary ancient and\r\nmedieval tendency to make each herb a cure for a long list of very\r\nmiscellaneous and unrelated ailments. Cinnamon and pepper,[1558] for\r\nexample, he appears to regard as panaceas, an interesting side-light on\r\nmedieval fondness for spices. A fair sample of his ordinary treatment\r\nis provided by the chapter on the herb _Cameleon_ or _Camelea_. Pliny\r\nsays that it purges the stomach and removes phlegm and bile. Ulcers are\r\npurged by cooking its leaves in two parts of wormwood and drinking them\r\nwith syrup of honey, at the same time making a poultice of the leaves.\r\nThey say that if anyone plucks it before sunrise and states that he\r\ntakes it for white growths of the eyes, the ailment will be removed by\r\nits application. Indeed, gathered in any way it is wholesome for the\r\neyes of the young. Dioscorides says that it removes phlegm and makes a\r\nhealing poultice for foul wounds. Avicenna holds that it should be used\r\nonly in external applications, where it has cleansing, soothing, and\r\nsoftening properties. It is beneficial for morphea, scab, ringworm, and\r\ncorrosive ulcers. By this point the citation from Avicenna must have\r\nterminated, since we are informed that the roots of the white variety\r\ntaken in wine as a drink help a patient suffering from dropsy. These\r\nroots of the white variety also kill worms, while the black kind kills\r\nany venomous creature. Vincent then cites the _Herbarium_, presumably\r\nof the pseudo-Apuleius, to the effect that the _Cameleon_ has the\r\nforce of tyriac or theriac, that a decoction of it solves difficulty\r\nin urinating and cures intestinal worms and dropsy.[1559] Besides the\r\nauthors cited in the foregoing chapter Vincent makes use on the subject\r\nof vegetation of such writers as Solinus, Isidore, the _Hexaemeron_\r\nof Ambrose, the work of Isaac on diet, Platearius, and Constantinus\r\nAfricanus. He apparently does not use Galen’s work on medicinal simples\r\ndirectly.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Animals.]\r\n\r\nVincent discusses animals at even greater length than vegetation,\r\ndevoting a book each to birds, fish, and snakes; two to quadrupeds;\r\nothers to animal life and processes in general; and still others to\r\nhuman physiology and psychology. Again we encounter the marvelous\r\nvirtues, medicinal and otherwise, inherent in parts of animals, and\r\namusing accounts of their ways and instinctive sagacity. The eagle\r\nplaces certain stones in its nest to counteract its own excessive heat\r\nin the hatching process; the bird called “goat-milker” steals milk\r\nfrom goats’ udders by night; the cormorant dips its head beneath the\r\nwave to collect signs of the weather and flies shoreward clamorously,\r\nif it detects a storm approaching; the parrot bites rocks and drinks\r\nwine.[1560] Pope Alexander had a cloak made of the wool of salamanders\r\nwhich, whenever it became soiled, was cleansed by casting it into the\r\nflames instead of washing it in water.[1561] Vincent borrows his\r\nstatements of the virtues of animals and their parts to a large extent\r\nfrom Pliny, whose contents we have earlier sufficiently presented. The\r\nmedicinal virtues of the human body and its different parts are also\r\nset forth in much the usual fashion. Vincent’s considerable number\r\nof citations from Physiologus are, like Bartholomew’s, difficult to\r\nidentify with those of any existing Bestiary. Some seem connected with\r\nScriptural Glosses. It is remarkable that while he cites Physiologus\r\na good deal concerning birds and serpents,[1562] in the book on\r\nquadrupeds he does not cite Physiologus for the lion, _onager_, and\r\nother such animals as figure prominently in the so-called Physiologus\r\nand Bestiaries.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The tree of life and the bodies of the damned.]\r\n\r\nIn the thirty-first book on paradise and the fall of man Vincent quotes\r\nPeter Comestor who, unlike Philo Judaeus, believes in the actual\r\nexistence of both the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of\r\ngood and evil. He states that the tree of life was so called from\r\nits natural effect, which was so to strengthen in perpetual solidity\r\nthe body of him who ate of it that he would suffer no infirmity,\r\nanxiety, or old age.[1563] Thus Vincent encourages belief not only\r\nin transmutation of metals but some natural method of maintaining\r\nperpetual youth and health. In the _Mirror of History_ he quotes\r\n“the sayings of a certain simple and good man,” to whom, among other\r\nrevelations concerning the end of the world, the information had been\r\nvouchsafed that the torments of the damned would largely consist in\r\nthe removal from their bodies of all the good qualities which now\r\ntemper the contrariety of the bad, which would thus be left to vex them\r\nunopposed and unassuaged.[1564]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Who sinned the more, Adam or Eve?]\r\n\r\nVincent ventures on some amusing theological speculation of his own in\r\ndiscussing the interesting question whether Adam or Eve sinned more\r\nin eating the apple.[1565] As might be expected of a medieval man and\r\nclergyman, he decides against the woman. Eve sinned in four respects\r\nand Adam in only two. First she sinned in doubting the divine warning;\r\nsecond, in wishing to steal divinity for herself; third, in eating\r\ncontrary to the prohibition; fourth, in tempting man to eat. Adam was\r\nnot seduced into thinking that he could become divine by this method,\r\nbut was led astray by a certain amiable good-will, fearing to offend\r\nhis wife if he did not eat the apple which she offered him. Thus Eve’s\r\nintention in sinning was the worse and woman has been punished for it\r\nthe more severely. Yet Adam sinned in two respects, namely, in secret\r\npride and in eating what had been forbidden. Another reason why Eve was\r\nthe greater sinner was that she sinned against more persons; against\r\nGod, against herself, and against her neighbor. But in one respect\r\nAdam’s sin was the graver; he knew better, while Eve sinned in a\r\ncertain measure from ignorance and feminine incapacity.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Classification of the sciences.]\r\n\r\nWe may also note Vincent’s classification of the sciences. As he\r\nadopted the common Christian division of the world’s history into\r\nsix ages, as in the _Speculum naturale_ he followed the order of\r\nthe six days of creation, so in the third _Mirror of Doctrine_ he\r\nmade six fields of knowledge; literary, moral, mechanical, physical,\r\nmathematical, and theological.[1566] This suggests Roger Bacon’s\r\nselection of the five most essential subjects leading up to the study\r\nof theology, namely, the languages, mathematics, perspective or optics,\r\nexperimental or applied science, and moral philosophy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Concluding estimate of the _Speculum naturale_.]\r\n\r\nSuch is the _Speculum maius_ or more particularly the _Speculum\r\nnaturale_, a work impressive by its very voluminousness and multitude\r\nof citations of authorities, valuable as a work of reference, a great\r\nstorehouse of medieval lore, providing somewhat the same retrospect\r\nupon previous medieval and Latin science as Pliny’s _Natural History_\r\nafforded for Hellenistic science. We can, however, recover more of\r\nits sources than in the case of Pliny; and when we have read them,\r\nVincent’s excerpts from them drop to a secondary place in our esteem.\r\nWe see how much of his work had been done for him by previous\r\ncompilers like Bartholomew of England and Thomas of Cantimpré, and how\r\nlarge a portion of his work is a repetition of Pliny himself. Vincent’s\r\nvolumes suggest the use of scissors and paste a little too manifestly.\r\nOn the other hand, his work does not include everything that is in\r\nprevious medieval writers on nature, to say nothing of others that were\r\nto come after him, and the assumption made even by specialists in the\r\nstudy of medieval culture, like Rose, Berthelot, and Mâle, that the\r\n_Speculum naturale_ alone is an adequate reflection of medieval natural\r\nscience and that Vincent is sure to mention any previous writer or\r\ntreatise,--this assumption is far from true. His _Mirror_ is a glass\r\nthrough which we see darkly and not face to face.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1514] Our two chief accounts of Vincent’s life and works are still the\r\nlong article by Daunou in HL XVIII (1835), 449-519, and M. l’Abbé J.\r\nB. Bourgeat, _Études sur Vincent de Beauvais_, Paris, 1856. A little\r\nmore recent is E. Boutaric, _Vincent de Beauvais et la Connaissance\r\nde l’antiquité classique au XIIIe siècle_, in _Revue des Questions\r\nHistoriques_, XVII (1875), 5-57.\r\n\r\nI have used the following edition of the _Mirror of Nature_:\r\n_Vincentius Bellovacensis, Speculum naturale, sine nota_ (_Nurembergae,\r\nAnth. Koburger_, 1485), in two huge folio volumes. Later editions than\r\nthis are apt to be very faulty. I have used an edition of the _Speculum\r\ndoctrinale_ of 1472 (?) and one of the _Speculum historiale_ of 1473.\r\n\r\n[1515] Prologue, cap. 17; cited HL XVIII, 475.\r\n\r\n[1516] Ptolemy of Lucca XXII, 26, in Muratori, X, 1155. I unfortunately\r\nomitted to verify the citation from the _Speculum historiale_, at the\r\ntime that I had access to that work.\r\n\r\n[1517] As a matter of fact Vincent cites Albert concerning the odors of\r\ncertain metals (V, 106) without naming any book.\r\n\r\n[1518] Or thirty-second book in some editions. As a matter of fact the\r\ndate 1244-1245 is also indicated at the close of the preceding book.\r\n\r\n[1519] In book XXXII, edition of 1473, he mentions the death of Edmund\r\nRich, archbishop of Canterbury, in 1247; and (cap. 102) tells how St.\r\nLouis in 1250 sent his brothers Alphonse of Poitou and Charles of\r\nAnjou back to console their mother; while in caps. 103-4 we read of\r\nPeter of Milan being canonized by Innocent IV in the tenth year of his\r\npontificate or about 1254.\r\n\r\n[1520] Vincent does not seem to know or use Albert’s _De vegetabilibus\r\net plantis_ in seven books, citing instead apparently Alfred of\r\nEngland’s translation of the two books of the _De plantis_. I doubt,\r\nhowever, if Vincent’s failure to cite a work by Albertus Magnus can be\r\ntaken as sure proof that the work had not yet been written. Vincent was\r\nfar from noting or including everything that was known in his time or\r\nhad been written before, although some lazy investigators of the past\r\nhave seen fit to assume that his work adequately depicted the entirety\r\nof medieval natural science.\r\n\r\n[1521] _Spec, nat._, XXVII, 74 and 82; see also 101.\r\n\r\n[1522] HL XVIII, 485.\r\n\r\n[1523] HL XVIII, 504.\r\n\r\n[1524] His use of classical authors has already been treated by E.\r\nBoutaric, _Vincent de Beauvais et la Connaisance de l’Antiquité\r\nclassique au XIIIe siècle_, in _Revue des Questions Historiques_, XVII\r\n(1875), 5-57; also printed separately.\r\n\r\nFabricius, _Bibliotheca Graeca_, 1718-1728, XIV, 107-25, gives a\r\nlist of about 350 names of authors or titles cited in the _Speculum\r\nnaturale_; of these 254 are repeated by Daunou in HL XVIII, 483-4.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, at least in the printed edition of 1485, it is often\r\nnot clear where quotations begin and end, or to just what passages the\r\nnames of the authorities who are cited apply.\r\n\r\n[1525] Daunou (HL XVIII, 486) asserts that Vincent had better MSS of\r\nPliny than Albertus Magnus had.\r\n\r\n[1526] _Spec. nat._, I, 10, _Apologia de modo excerpendi de quibusdam\r\nlibris Arestotelis_.\r\n\r\n[1527] _Ibid._, I, 3.\r\n\r\n[1528] _Ibid._, VII, 6-7.\r\n\r\n[1529] _Ibid._, IV, 93-4.\r\n\r\n[1530] _De animalibus_, XXIII, 14.

At\r\nthe close of the thirteenth century Peter of Abano and Arnald of\r\nVillanova were such important personalities and so addicted, the one\r\nto astrology, and the other to occult science, that we must devote an\r\nentire chapter to each. Of the writers before them it will perhaps be\r\nsufficient if we consider in some detail, first Gilbert of England, who\r\nseems to have flourished in the first half of the thirteenth century\r\nand who was much cited by the later medical writers; next, a brief\r\nbut significant work in astrological medicine composed in 1219 by a\r\nWilliam of England (or of Aragon?); and finally in a second chapter\r\nPetrus Hispanus, who terminated his brilliant career in 1277 as Pope\r\nJohn XXI, and to whose account of “the way of experience” we shall\r\nadd briefly something concerning the similar discussion of medical\r\nexperiment in John of St. Amand who seems to have written between 1262\r\nand 1280.[1567]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Question of Gilbert’s date.]\r\n\r\nIt seems certain from the citation of Gilbert by Petrus Hispanus and\r\nother writers--possibly by Bartholomew of England--that he must have\r\nwritten rather early in the thirteenth century.[1568] Haeser,[1569] who\r\ndated him about 1290, and Freind, who dated him about 1270, are both\r\ncertainly wrong. But his date has not yet been fixed with exactness,\r\nand it is doubted whether he was physician to Hubert Walter who died in\r\n1205, as Bale, Pits, and Leland tell us. It is also disputed whether a\r\nMaster Richard whom he cites was Richard of Salerno, who flourished at\r\nthe close of the twelfth century, or Richard of Wendover and Paris, who\r\nwas physician to Pope Gregory IX (1227-1241) and died himself in 1252\r\nor 1256. Because our Gilbert cites Averroes it has been argued[1570]\r\nthat he did not flourish until the middle of the thirteenth century but\r\nMichael Scot had translated Averroes’ commentary on the metaphysics of\r\nAristotle early in the century.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Works ascribed to Gilbert.]\r\n\r\nA manuscript in the Bibliothèque Nationale at Paris contains\r\n_Experiments of Master Gilbert, Chancellor of Montpellier_,[1571] and\r\nthere was a chancellor of that university named _Gillibertus_ in 1250.\r\nIt remains uncertain, however, whether he was the same as Gilbert of\r\nEngland, and whether the _Experiments_ are by Gilbert of England or\r\nperhaps a later compilation made partly from his _Compendium_ and\r\npartly from other sources. The _Dictionary of National Biography_\r\ndescribes the _Experiments_ as “a collection of receipts, many of which\r\nbear Gilbert’s name and are certainly his, for they agree closely with\r\npassages in his _Compendium_ without being identical.” If “Experiments\r\nof a Chancellor and Cardinal” in a manuscript at Madrid[1572] were the\r\nsame work, there would be reason for thinking that Gilbert of England\r\nbecame a cardinal. “A secret of Gilbert the cardinal” is contained in\r\nan alchemistic manuscript of the fifteenth century at Cambridge.[1573]\r\nWe also hear of a Gilbertus Anglicus who was a great theologian and\r\nwrote a commentary upon the oracle of Cyril the Carmelite.[1574]\r\nIt would not be strange to have in the course of a century or two\r\nmore than one writer from England named Gilbert. But it also at that\r\ntime would not be strange to have the same man write on medicine and\r\ntheology, and such a man is just the one who might be expected to fill\r\nboth the posts of chancellor at Montpellier and cardinal at the papal\r\ncourt. We shall see that Peter of Spain wrote on logic as well as\r\nmedicine and became pope. But to note one or two other treatises that\r\nhave been ascribed to Gilbert of England. An _Antidotarium_ which is\r\nascribed to him in a thirteenth century manuscript[1575] is perhaps\r\na portion of the _Compendium_, but the commentary of Gilbert on the\r\n_Verses of Giles concerning Urines_ was an independent and well-known\r\nwork.[1576]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The _Compendium medicinae_.]\r\n\r\nGilbert’s chief work, and the one which we shall discuss, is the\r\n_Compendium medicinae_,[1577] a medical compilation in seven books. Its\r\nquotations from the _Surgery_ (_Chirurgia_) of Roger of Parma inclined\r\nDr. Handerson to date it about 1240 and not before 1230.[1578] It\r\nseems to have set the style for such works as the _Lilium medicinae_\r\nof Bernard Gordon and the _Rosa medicinae_ of John of Gaddesden.[1579]\r\nThe first book deals with fevers, the second begins with the hair,\r\nthe third treats of diseases of the eyes, the fourth of ills of the\r\nneck and throat, the fifth discusses the appetite, the sixth the\r\nliver, and the seventh the private parts. The seven books of Gordon’s\r\n_Lilium_ cover the same ground respectively, except that Gordon omits\r\nthe surgical passages which Gilbert incorporated in his work.[1580] E.\r\nLittré in the _Histoire Littéraire_ has described Gilbert’s work as\r\n“abounding in superstitious or ridiculous or childish formulas.” To\r\nthese Gilbert often adds such expressions as “This has been proved,”\r\nor copies the accounts in his authorities even to such phrases as “in\r\nour presence.” But we have already seen this to be the practice in the\r\nfar-off days of Aëtius of Amida. Gilbert also often calls this or that\r\nassertion false, but here again the scepticism probably does not always\r\noriginate with him. His work is of course professedly a compilation.\r\nGilbert nevertheless seems at times to speak from his own experience\r\nand medical practice.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: General character of his medicine.]\r\n\r\nIf one were to attempt a brief general characterization of Gilbert’s\r\nmedicine, it would be that he combines Aristotelian principles and\r\nreasoning, and the hypothesis of four elements and four qualities,\r\nwith a practical regimen of bathing, diet, bleeding, plasters, rubbing\r\nwith ointments, and the like--which is perhaps largely Salernitan.\r\nHis procedure is vitiated by a large residuum from early magic as\r\nwell as by incorrect scientific hypotheses handed down from the Greek\r\nphilosophers. His pharmacy, however, makes more use of herbs than of\r\ngems or of parts of animals. But his recipes are legion and many of\r\nthem include an absurdly large number of ingredients. He also discusses\r\nthe signs of diseases, their course and character, and the processes of\r\nthe human body.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: An estimate of it by a modern physician.]\r\n\r\nSince I wrote the preceding paragraph, a rather detailed presentation\r\nof the contents of Gilbert’s _Compendium_ has fortunately been\r\npublished in English from the pen of one better fitted than I to\r\njudge its medical defects and merits. Dr. Handerson’s eminently sane\r\nconclusions may be briefly indicated by two quotations. “It is not\r\ndifficult, of course, to select from the Compendium a charm or two,\r\na few impossible etymologies and a few silly statements, to display\r\nthese with a witty emphasis and to draw therefrom the easy conclusion\r\nthat the book is a mass of crass superstition and absurd nonsense.\r\nThis, however, is not criticism. It is mere caricature.”[1581] “The\r\nbook is, undoubtedly, the work of a famous and strictly orthodox\r\nphysician, possessed of exceptional education in the science of his\r\nday, a man of wide reading, broadened by extensive travel and endowed\r\nby the knowledge acquired by a long experience, honest, truthful, and\r\nsimple minded, yet not uncritical in regard to novelties, firm in his\r\nown opinions but not arrogant, sympathetic, possessed of a high sense\r\nof professional honor, a firm believer in authority and therefore\r\ncredulous, superstitious after the manner of his age, yet harboring,\r\ntoo, a germ of ... healthy scepticism.”[1582]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Picturesque compounds.]\r\n\r\nSome of Gilbert’s over-elaborate compounds possess picturesque names\r\nas well, for instance, the potion of St. Paul and the ladder of\r\nHermes.[1583] The latter was composed at Heliopolis on the altar of\r\nthe sun and written not in letters but figures. It consists of sixty\r\ndifferent simples and is called a ladder because the amount of these\r\nsimples used in the compound is increased step by step. First one takes\r\none ounce each of four simples, then two ounces each of four more, and\r\nso on for four species at a time, until the quantity of fifteen ounces\r\nis reached and the list of sixty simples is exhausted. This compound is\r\nasserted to be beneficial for rather more than fifteen ailments.[1584]\r\nGilbert employs various Salernitan pills and they usually contain from\r\nten to twenty ingredients each.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Empirica_ and an old-wife’s remedy.]\r\n\r\nWhen other remedies fail Gilbert has recourse, like Marcellus, to\r\n_empirica_. One by which many “under our charge” (_in manu nostra_)\r\nwho were thought sterile have borne children is as follows.[1585] In\r\nthe vigil of St. John the Baptist[1586] dig certain herbs by the roots\r\nfrom the earth before the third hour, repeating the Lord’s Prayer\r\nthrice and not speaking to anyone going or returning. In silence, too,\r\nextract the juice from the herbs and write on a piece of parchment\r\nthese words, “The Lord said, ‘Increase’ x Uthiboth x ‘and multiply’\r\nx thabechay x ‘and fill the earth’ x amath x.” If the man wears this\r\nwriting about his neck, a boy will be born; if the woman wears it, a\r\ngirl. Other _empirica_ employ suffumigations with a tooth of a dead\r\nman and an herb that has grown through a hole in a stone. In another\r\npassage to aid child-bearing Gilbert recommends the water in which a\r\nmurderer has washed his hands.[1587] He repeats the good old remedies\r\nfor gout of binding frogs’ legs or asses’ hoofs or tortoises’ feet\r\nupon the patient’s extremities, right on right and left on left, but\r\ncites therefor the mysterious authority “Torror,” while “Funeius” is\r\nhis source for the use of the magnet in the same way. Gilbert states,\r\nhowever, that he has little inclination towards these things, but that\r\nit is just as well not to omit what the ancients have said.[1588]\r\nIn another passage he tells that a certain old woman has freed many\r\npersons from jaundice with the cooked juice of the plantagenet.[1589]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Use of red for small-pox: occult virtue.]\r\n\r\nGilbert is credited with being the first to mention the employment of\r\nred colors in the treatment of small-pox.[1590] It is interesting to\r\nnote that the passage in which he does this has to do also with the\r\npractices of old-wives and with the conception of occult virtue. He\r\nwrites, “Old women of the countryside give burnt purple in drink, for\r\nit has the occult nature of curing _variolae_. The same is true of dyed\r\ncloths.”[1591] Here again therefore we seem to have a real discovery\r\ndeveloped from or concealed beneath a bit of experimental magic. John\r\nof Gaddesden is said to have used scarlet cloths to cure a son of\r\nEdward I of small-pox.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Magical treatment of epilepsy.]\r\n\r\nThe following very magical procedure is used for epilepsy and is called\r\n_expertissimum_.[1592] At the first access of the disease, when the\r\npatient falls to the ground, all his clothes except his shirt should be\r\nremoved and placed at his feet. The nails of all his fingers and toes\r\nshould next be clipped and wrapped in a cloth. A long white thorn is\r\nthen to be split and the patient dragged feet first through the cleft\r\nas far as his middle. The thorn should then be cut into small bits and\r\nplaced with the nail parings. Next the patient’s hair should be cut\r\nin three places. These clippings of hair and the knife used in the\r\noperation are then to be added to the other paraphernalia wrapped in\r\nthe cloth, and the whole is to be buried underground, and the following\r\nwords uttered. In the patient’s right ear, “Christ conquers”; in his\r\nleft ear, “Christ reigns”; and to his face, “Christ commands.” Others\r\nperform the ceremony differently, cutting the patient’s shoe latchet\r\ninto four pieces and burying them in the form of a cross at his head,\r\nfeet, and either hand with some of his nails and hair. And the names of\r\nthe three kings--that is, the Magi who came to adore Christ--should be\r\nworn about his neck.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Poisons and snake oil.]\r\n\r\nGilbert’s account of poisons repeats such usual statements as that the\r\nsaliva of a fasting man is poison for snakes,[1593] that the viper\r\ndeposits its venom on a stone by the shore when entering the water to\r\nhave commerce with the fish, and that there was a girl fed on poison\r\nwho caused the deaths of kings who loved her and whose saliva killed\r\nanimals who approached her.[1594] Gilbert cites for the last “Ruffus,”\r\nhowever, and not the _Secret of Secrets_. A medicinal unguent is made\r\nby cutting off the heads and tails of snakes, as in Galen’s directions\r\nfor preparing theriac, and distilling an oil from them.[1595]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Eye cures.]\r\n\r\nParts of animals are much employed in corrosives for eye complaints.\r\nGreen lizards, all gall, but especially that of birds of prey, _omne\r\nstercus_ but human especially, all salts but especially nitrates, the\r\ninner skin of a hen’s liver, the blood of a black fly, and many other\r\nsimilar substances are recommended.[1596] For spots in the eyes Gilbert\r\nsuggests administering whole in drink the little worms with many feet\r\nwhich are found between the bark and trunk of trees. “But they should\r\nbe taken with the Lord’s Prayer.”[1597]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Influence of the stars.]\r\n\r\nOccasionally a passage evinces Gilbert’s belief in the influence of the\r\nstars. He speaks of the participation of the heavens in the process\r\nof human generation[1598] and of the influence of the various planets\r\non the formation of the embryo in the womb.[1599] In arguing that a\r\npoisonous compound multiplies its potency through the union of the\r\nspecies composing it, and that it “has a stronger action than if it\r\nwere simple”[1600]--a passage in which there is a close approach to\r\nour conception of chemical change--Gilbert adduces the influence of\r\nthe heavens as a factor in increasing the strength of the compound. He\r\nholds that the celestial bodies resemble terrestrial mineral substances\r\nin not feeling pain, but that unlike them they are sentient, sensible,\r\nand unchangeable. They are bodies, but uncorruptible.[1601] Arnald\r\nof Villanova[1602] at the end of the century cites Gilbert’s warning\r\nin his first book on fevers against bleeding the patient during dog\r\ndays or the Egyptian days or when the moon is in conjunction with\r\na malevolent planet. Gilbert adds that the wise doctor will always\r\nobserve the moon.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The soul, number, and geometry; physiognomy.]\r\n\r\nIn the midst of his discussion of dropsy Gilbert digresses to treat\r\nof the soul, “because ignorance gives birth to shame and stupidity\r\nto poverty.” Some traces of numerical and geometrical mysticism are\r\nseen in his discussion.[1603] He represents Pythagoras as saying that\r\nthe soul is number moving itself, and that of its four properties or\r\nfunctions intellect is like the number one because it comprehends\r\nsimple matters and so is compared to a point. Reason is like two or\r\na line since it comprehends form as it exists in bodies. Opinion is\r\nlike four or a surface because it comprehends form as form. Science is\r\nlike eight or a cube because it comprehends form _ut est in subiecto_.\r\nGilbert further explains that the three souls assigned to man by\r\nAristotle are really the triple power of one soul.[1604] He compares\r\nthe vegetative soul to a triangle, the sensible soul to a square, and\r\nthe rational soul to a circle. Gilbert regards the disagreement between\r\nAristotle and Plato concerning the movement of the soul as verbal\r\nrather than real. “Aristotle discusses matters truly, essentially, and\r\nphilosophically; Plato, figuratively, casually, and mathematically.”\r\nGilbert occasionally embodies the dicta of the physiognomists in his\r\n_Compendium_, for instance: “He whose eyes are large and tremulous is\r\nlazy and a braggart and fond of women”; and “He who has large ears is\r\nstolid and long lived.”[1605]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Astrological medicine in William of England’s _De urina non\r\nvisa_.]\r\n\r\nBecause perhaps of Gilbert’s commentary upon the verses of Giles\r\nconcerning urines, a Master G. of England who is the author of “a\r\nbook in which he tells how to know the character of the urine without\r\ninspecting it and many other things by means of astrology,” in a Vienna\r\nmanuscript is called in the catalogue Gilbertus instead of Guilelmus\r\nAnglicus.[1606] As many other manuscripts[1607] of the treatise show,\r\nthe work is really the _Of Urine Unseen_ written in 1219 by William\r\nof England, a citizen of Marseilles, by profession a medical man, by\r\nmerit of science an astronomer, as he himself states. Indeed, there\r\nare extant other astronomical works by him, one of which is dated\r\n1231.[1608] The object of the brief treatise is how to tell the nature\r\nof the patient’s disease and the outcome of it from the stars and signs\r\nof the zodiac without inspection of the patient’s urine. The nine\r\nchapters deal with (1) “the quadruple way of astrological speculation,”\r\nthat is, nativities, revolutions, interrogations, and elections; (2)\r\n“the comprehension of the effects of superior bodies” on the human body\r\nfor each sign of the zodiac and the use of astrology in medicine; (3)\r\nthe division of the human body among the planets and their natures and\r\nproperties with the diseases appropriate to them; (4) the houses of\r\nthe planets; (5) the distribution of the parts of the body among the\r\nplanets and signs with an accompanying chart of eighty-four squares\r\narranged in seven columns and twelve rows; (6) how to arrive at a\r\njudgment in any particular case by finding the ruling planet;[1609] (7)\r\n“of the place of the liver and its significator and the virtues of the\r\nsame”; (8) of the color and substance of the urine; (9) of the outcome\r\nof the sickness and its end. William mentions in closing a case where\r\nhe correctly predicted that the patient would die in exactly two months\r\nand eight days.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Other works by William of England or by other Williams.]\r\n\r\nWe have already alluded elsewhere[1610] to “the very great secret\r\nof Catenus, king of the Persians, concerning the virtue of the\r\neagle” which William of England is credited with having translated\r\nfrom the Arabic. And we have suggested that a William of Aragon who\r\ncommented upon the _Centiloquium_ ascribed to Ptolemy and wrote a\r\ntreatise on the interpretation of dreams might possibly have been\r\nthe same man.[1611] We also hear of a “William, master of medicine,\r\nof Provençal nationality,” who translated from Greek into Latin the\r\nlife of the philosopher Secundus, which work he brought with him from\r\nConstantinople. Afterwards, we are told, this William became a monk\r\nof St. Denis and finally the abbot of that monastery. Secundus is\r\ndescribed as a philosopher who observed the rule of silence and led\r\nthe life of a Pythagorean, and who was associated with the emperor\r\nHadrian.[1612] He appears to have broken his silence enough to give\r\nforth _Sententiae_ which were treasured up by that emperor.[1613]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1567] HL, XXI, 541.\r\n\r\n[1568] On the life of Gilbert, besides the articles in DNB and HL 21\r\n(1847), 393-403, see J.

Some Manuscripts of the _Thesaurus\r\n pauperum_.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Nationality: at Paris.]\r\n\r\nPetrus Hispanus, or Peter of Spain, who finally became Pope John XXI,\r\nis said by Ptolemy of Lucca, who died fifty years after him in 1327,\r\nto have been of Portuguese nationality.[1614] His birth is placed at\r\nLisbon between 1210 and 1220, and he is said to have been the son of\r\na physician named Julian.[1615] However, in the preface to his _De\r\nconservanda sanitate_, as preserved in a fifteenth century manuscript,\r\nPeter speaks of himself as from Compostella and as familiar with\r\nall Italy, Burgundy, Gascony, and parts of Spain.[1616] In other\r\nmanuscripts he calls himself Petrus Hispanus. He came to the University\r\nof Paris at an early age, as he himself testified when pope in a letter\r\nto the bishop of Paris.[1617] In the same epistle he refers to the many\r\nyears he spent at Paris occupied with varied studies. His text-book in\r\nlogic was universally adopted and often commented upon, and has now\r\nbeen shown to be, not, as Prantl held in his _History of Logic_,[1618]\r\na copy of the work of Psellus, but an independent product of the\r\nParisian school. It was printed from forty to fifty times between 1477\r\nand 1519.[1619]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Medical works and later life.]\r\n\r\nFrom 1246 to 1250 Peter was at Siena in the faculty of arts. Perhaps\r\nhe then wrote the letter to the emperor, Frederick II, _On the Rule\r\nof Health_, if it be a genuine work, which precedes his _Thesaurus\r\npauperum_ in at least one manuscript.[1620] Ptolemy of Lucca calls\r\nPeter “an all-round scholar and specialist in medicine,”[1621] and\r\nmentions particularly among his medical works the famous _Thesaurus\r\npauperum_, which we shall presently consider as a very influential\r\nand representative handbook of medieval medicine. In all seventeen\r\nmedical works are attributed to Peter, of which only three have been\r\nprinted.[1622] At the beginning of his treatise on eye diseases\r\nPeter speaks of himself as a professor of the art of medicine and an\r\ninvestigator of the truth.[1623] In the _Thesaurus pauperum_ he cites\r\nAlbertus Magnus as well as Gilbertus Anglicus, but he probably did\r\nnot write it very late in life. Pope Gregory X made Peter a cardinal\r\nin 1273,[1624] he was also an archbishop, and in 1276 the career of\r\nthe celebrated scholar culminated in his election to the papal see\r\nfollowing Gregory’s death.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death and character.]\r\n\r\nThe next year Peter met an untimely death from the fall of a ceiling,\r\na catastrophe which according to the gossip of Ptolemy of Lucca\r\noccurred while he was engaged in a fit of complacent and self-admiring\r\nlaughter and shortly after he had issued some fulminations against the\r\nmonks, for whom he had little love. Ptolemy criticizes the pope as not\r\ndignified enough in speech and manner for his office, but concedes\r\nthat he was easily approached and very kindly to all scholars and\r\nmen of letters. Millot-Carpentier regarded him as “assuredly one of\r\nthe most illustrious personages of the thirteenth century both as a\r\nphilosopher and as a dialectician,” and as “a true scholar and worthy\r\nrepresentative of the University of Paris, ... having all the faults of\r\nhis time but endowed with a liberal spirit.”[1625] Millot-Carpentier\r\nalso gives a list of ecclesiastical offices, honors, and dignities held\r\nby other physicians of the period in addition to the supreme honor of a\r\npapal election which Peter attained.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The _Thesaurus pauperum_.]\r\n\r\nPeter’s book, the _Thesaurus pauperum_, became perhaps the leading\r\nbrief medical manual during the remainder of the middle ages, as\r\nthe numerous extant manuscripts and many printed editions bear\r\nwitness.[1626] It was translated into Spanish, Portuguese, Italian,\r\nand English. The work was intended to be a condensed compilation and\r\nits title, “The Treasure of the Poor,” indicates that it was written\r\nespecially for the benefit of poor students and medical practitioners,\r\nwho could not afford many books. It thus continues the type of\r\nbook represented by Galen’s _Euporista_ and by the compendiums of\r\npost-classical medicine, and is to be regarded, like Bartholomew of\r\nEngland’s “On the Properties of Things,” as an example of a medieval\r\ntext-book and not as a specialized work.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Is it interpolated?]\r\n\r\nStapper states in his Life of Pope John XXI[1627] that the text of the\r\n_Thesaurus pauperum_ has suffered greatly from later interpolations,\r\nthat every successive transcriber of the manuscript felt at liberty\r\nto add any further recipes of past authors that hit his fancy, and\r\nthat thereby a great deal of superstitious nonsense for which the\r\npope should not be held accountable was added to the original work.\r\nBut on what authority or from what personal inspection of manuscripts\r\nStapper makes this assertion is not clear. He lists, it is true, a\r\nnumber of manuscripts in continental libraries and a few at Oxford,\r\nbut his citations of the _Thesaurus pauperum_ are all from the Lyons\r\nedition of 1525. It is also true that he affirms that he has searched\r\nthe manuscripts in vain for the sentence in the preface of the printed\r\ntext in which it is stated that ligatures are not superstitious. But I\r\nhave found the passage without much search in three manuscripts of one\r\nlibrary.[1628] Possibly one reason why Stapper failed to find it is\r\nthat the opening word of the sentence is not _Litteras_, which he gives\r\npresumably from the 1525 edition, and which would mean “characters” if\r\nit could mean anything in the context in question, but _Ligaturas_, as\r\nthe 1497 edition correctly has it.[1629]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Essential character of the work fairly represented even by\r\nthe printed version.]\r\n\r\nMy own feeling is rather that the book, even in the printed editions\r\nof 1497 and 1578 which I had access to, is not more superstitious\r\nthan one would expect a compilation of ancient, Arabic, and medieval\r\nmedicine to be. The 1497 edition, it is true, confesses to a number of\r\nadditions from a Peter of Tuscany (? _de tusciano_) and from Bernard\r\nGordon; but it gives these additions separately at the close of various\r\nchapters. I have also inspected a number of manuscripts of the work at\r\nthe British Museum, none of which Stapper mentions in his list, and\r\nwhich date from the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. It is not easy\r\nto compare these different copies or versions, since they vary greatly\r\nin headings and arrangement, so that the same statement may be found\r\nin different places in them. But there seem to be passages in the 1497\r\nedition which are not in the manuscripts, and these in turn, as is\r\nusually the case, are not all alike in contents.[1630] But while there\r\nmay be considerable interpolation, it does not seem to have essentially\r\naltered the original character of the book. The superstitious nonsense\r\nmay have increased in amount but scarcely in degree. Much the same\r\nsort of remedies may be found in the earliest manuscript and latest\r\nprinted text. To be on the safe side, however, in the ensuing account\r\nof the _Thesaurus pauperum_ I shall follow the manuscripts rather than\r\nthe printed text. I shall then add some account of other treatises\r\nwhich I have found ascribed to Peter in the manuscripts and of his\r\nprinted Commentaries on Isaac’s _Diets_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Devout tone of its preface.]\r\n\r\nThe brief preface, which appears in most of the manuscripts that I\r\nhave seen as well as in the printed editions, gives a good idea of\r\nthe nature of the work. Its opening sentence reflects the religious\r\nspirit of the age and status of the author. “In the name of the holy\r\nand indissoluble Trinity, who created all things which are not God and\r\nwho endowed individual objects with their particular virtues, from\r\nwhom all wisdom is given to the wise and science to scientists, I\r\napproach a task beyond my powers trusting in the aid of the same, who\r\nworks through us as instruments all good works.” In a second sentence,\r\ngiven differently in the manuscripts and printed texts, the author\r\nstates the title of his work, _Thesaurus pauperum_. Later he adds that\r\nthe attentive reader will find here easy and efficacious medicines\r\nfor almost all infirmities, provided he has Him as helper who created\r\nmedicine from earth. He also warns the physician, lest by his science\r\nhe impugn God the giver of science, to take the utmost care not to\r\nreveal to anyone any medicines by which pregnancy may be prevented\r\nor abortions provoked. In most manuscripts that I have examined the\r\npreface presently concludes with the sentence, “Therefore in the name\r\nof Jesus Christ, the supreme physician, who heals at His will all our\r\ninfirmities, since He is the head of the faithful, let us begin with\r\ndiseases of the head and descend to the feet.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Arrangement of the text.]\r\n\r\nThis top to toe order, taking up one ailment after another and listing\r\nremedies in connection with each, was already common[1631] and is\r\ngenerally followed with some variations in the manuscripts. The 1497\r\npreface also states that the work is divided into four books, but this\r\ndivision is neither promised nor performed in most of the manuscripts.\r\nTwo seem to go no farther than where the third book ends in the 1497\r\nedition, and two others give the first few chapters of its fourth book\r\nas a separate treatise on fevers.[1632] Indeed the colophon to the\r\n1497 edition states that Peter’s treatise on fevers has been added to\r\nthe _Thesaurus pauperum_. In the 1578 edition instead of four books we\r\nfind simply eighty-five headings representing as many diseases. Some\r\nmanuscripts also have tables of contents. Royal 12 B III gives but\r\nfifty-two headings, ending with quartan fever, while Additional MS.\r\n32,622 and Harleian MS. 5218 sometimes have more and sometimes fewer\r\nheadings than the 1497 text, which has 21, 18, 19, and 20 chapters\r\nrespectively in its four books. The other manuscripts which I have seen\r\nhave to a considerable extent the same headings, and still more so the\r\nsame matter, but the order varies somewhat.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Emphasis on occult virtue.]\r\n\r\nReturning to the preface, we may note that the author counsels the\r\nreader not to despise what he reads because it is unfamiliar to him,\r\nand also not to apply the remedies before carefully considering the\r\nnature of the disease and the condition of the patient. “And let him\r\nstudy diligently to learn the natures and constitutions and substances\r\nof things, and as far as he can the occult virtue of particular\r\nthings.”[1633] Otherwise it will be a case of blind leading blind. We\r\nhave already seen that in addition to this profession of belief in\r\noccult virtue of particular objects some manuscripts, though hardly the\r\noldest or most reliable ones, assert further that ligatures are not\r\nsuperstitious but act directly, especially if a right foot is bound on\r\nthe right foot, or a male animal on a man.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Authority and experiment.]\r\n\r\nThe preface also informs us of the sources whence the work has been\r\ncompiled. These are “the books of the ancient philosophers and masters\r\nand of modern experimenters.” The author has tried either to present\r\ntheir views in their own words, or to express their precise meaning in\r\nother words of easier comprehension, so that if you had their books\r\nat hand you would find nothing other than what he sets down here, and\r\nso that in perusing his book you may seem to read the originals. The\r\nmention of “modern experimenters” is a foretaste of the “experimental”\r\ncharacter of the _Thesaurus pauperum_. In some manuscripts it is\r\ncalled a _Book of Experiments_ or a _Summa_ of medicinal experiments,\r\nand it is sometimes included in collections of expressly experimental\r\nworks. One reason for this is the common medieval use of the word\r\n“experimentum” for almost any medicinal recipe or remedy, but another\r\nreason is that Peter’s remedies are rather empirical in character.\r\nAnd as early as Galen’s time the Empirics relied partly for their\r\nexperiences upon the statements of past authors. Moreover, we meet\r\nthroughout the _Thesaurus pauperum_ with assurances that this or that\r\nhas been experienced, or that experts or “Experimenter” have said\r\nso, or even that “I have experienced this.”[1634] These uses of the\r\nfirst person are often probably copied from Peter’s authorities, but\r\nthey later came to be regarded as his own experiences, since the 1578\r\nedition describes the _Thesaurus pauperum_ in the full title as “an\r\nempirical work from all sorts of authors and his own experience.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Some of his authorities.]\r\n\r\nAmong his authorities Peter makes much use of recent works and writers,\r\nsuch as Constantinus Africanus and Platearius and the _Antidotarium_\r\nof Nicholaus, Walter and Richard and Roger, _Experimentator_ and\r\n_Lapidarius_ and _Liber de natura rerum_, Gilbert of England and\r\nAlbertus Magnus. He of course utilizes such Hebrew and Arabic medical\r\nwriters as Isaac, Rasis, Haly, and Avicenna. It is worth noting as a\r\nhint of the superstitious character of parts of his work that he cites\r\nthe Kiranides a good deal. Galen and “Dyascorides”--often pseudo,\r\nPliny and Esculapius, are of course not forgotten.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Parts of animals: suspensions.]\r\n\r\nMuch use is made of parts of animals, and perhaps especially of those\r\nleast to be mentioned. Less nauseating examples are, among many similar\r\nparts of animals prescribed for epileptics, the liver of a vulture\r\ndrunk with its blood for nine days, or the gall still warm from a dog\r\nwho should have been killed the moment the epileptic fell in the fit.\r\nThis last is borrowed from Gilbert. Portions of the human body, too,\r\nare employed; for instance, burnt human bones or the tooth of a dead\r\nman. Suspensions from the neck of such objects as the hairs of a dog or\r\na cabbage root are also in favor.[1635]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Remedies for toothache.]\r\n\r\nSelection of a few details from two or three specimen chapters will\r\nfurther illustrate the nature of the contents. For toothache is\r\nrecommended touching the ailing tooth with one from a corpse, holding\r\nin the mouth violets cooked in wine, holding a grain of opium between\r\nthe teeth. Other remedies are vinegar in which a root of jusquiam has\r\nbeen boiled, deer horn burnt until it whitens and dries, and a powder\r\nmade from dogs’ teeth. Cavities may be filled with the brain of a\r\npartridge or crow’s dung. The latter “breaks the tooth and removes\r\npain.” A tooth may be easily extracted by touching it with dog’s milk\r\nor applying a hot root of jusquiam to its roots. But in the latter case\r\nbeware not to touch the other teeth or they will fall out too.[1636]\r\nThese remedies are, however, mild indeed compared to the treatment\r\nfor toothache prescribed by Pliny in two chapters of his _Natural\r\nHistory_.[1637] Nor do I find in those chapters a passage ascribed to\r\nPliny in the _Thesaurus pauperum_, in which one is directed to dig a\r\nroot without use of iron, touch the ailing tooth with it for three\r\ndays, and then replace it where one has dug it, after which “that tooth\r\nwill never ache again.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Prescriptions for epilepsy.]\r\n\r\nFor epilepsy besides parts of animals and suspensions already\r\nmentioned, “Experimenter says and I have heard from experts that eating\r\na wolf’s heart cures.”[1638] Or one may try the following experiment:\r\nTake a frog and split him down the back with a knife, and extract his\r\nliver and wrap it up in a cabbage leaf, and reduce it to a powder in\r\na sealed pot, and give it to the epileptic to drink with the best\r\nwine. “And if one frog does not cure him, give him another, and so on\r\nuntil he is cured; and don’t doubt concerning the cure, for he will\r\nbe cured beyond a doubt.”[1639] From Constantinus and Walter[1640] is\r\nrepeated the cure of an epileptic child by bringing him to church on\r\ncertain days and having him hear mass and having the priest read over\r\nhim the Scripture about this sort of demon not being cast out except\r\nby fasting and prayer. Most of the manuscripts also state that one who\r\ncarries with him the names of the three kings who adored Christ will\r\nbe free from epilepsy, and some give their names, Jasper, Baltaser,\r\nMelchior.[1641]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Against sorcerers and demons.]\r\n\r\nUnder the caption of remedies for witchcraft and possession by demons\r\nare found such procedures as smearing the walls of the house with the\r\nblood of a black dog or burying a reed filled with quicksilver under\r\nthe threshold. A recipe to rescue a patient from infatuation in love\r\nproduced by sorcery is hardly translateable, but affords too good an\r\nexample of sympathetic magic or of human psychology to be omitted\r\nentirely. “Si quis ad aliquam vel aliquem nimis amandum maleficiatus\r\nfuerit, tum stercus recens illius quem vel quam diligit ponatur in\r\nocrea vel in calceo dextro amantis, et calciet se et quamprimum\r\nfoetorem sentiat, maleficium solvetur.” It is also stated that wearing\r\nthe heart of a vulture makes one popular with all men and very\r\nwealthy, and that by vivisecting the bird hoopoe and eating its still\r\npalpitating heart one may learn the future and all secrets concealed\r\nin men’s minds.[1642]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _De morbis oculorum._]\r\n\r\nVery similar to the remedies of the _Thesaurus pauperum_ are those in\r\nPeter’s treatise on diseases of the eyes.[1643] The works are further\r\nalike in being compilations and yet experimental or empirical. Peter\r\nstates that he has collected his material on eye diseases from many\r\nbooks at the urging of a disciple,[1644] and that it is based upon\r\nreason and experience. Of one recipe for removing ingrowing eyebrows\r\nhe says, “I have tested this with my own hands”; and he cites as an\r\nexperiment of Rasis the trite prescription of using the blood of a\r\nbat to prevent eyebrows or lashes which have been plucked out from\r\ngrowing again.[1645] Millot-Carpentier[1646] has already given a\r\nnumber of these eye-cures, bringing out chiefly the great use of parts\r\nof animals, which we have already remarked in the case of Gilbert of\r\nEngland. We may further note a bit of astrology. Peter first makes the\r\ngeneral assertion that the human body is subject to the planets and\r\nsigns,[1647] and later in describing the eye notes that it has seven\r\ntunics or humors covering it like the seven planets. There is also, as\r\nin the _Thesaurus pauperum_, some use of Christian incantations. To\r\nremove a fistula from the eye, besides using the blood from a cock’s\r\ncrest and pulverized snakeskin one should bind the leaf of an herb\r\nabout the patient’s foot and say, “As Christ descended from heaven into\r\nthe Virgin’s womb, so may the fistula descend from the eye to the\r\nfoot.”[1648] This is of course also an example of the magic transfer of\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Summa de conservanda sanitate._]\r\n\r\nA third treatise exists under Peter’s name in a British Museum\r\nmanuscript and is called a “Summa concerning the preservation of health\r\nand those things which assist and harm it.”[1649] This work opens in a\r\nmore self-confident and flamboyant style than the other treatises where\r\nPeter spoke of himself in a self-depreciatory manner. Now after a few\r\nlines of pious introduction we read, “Let the Jews blush, the Saracens\r\nbe put to confusion, roving practitioners desist, old enchantresses\r\nbe dumb, and empirics and methodics keep silence. Let rational\r\nphysicians rejoice and those descendants of the medical art who employ\r\nboth reason and experience. I, master Petrus Hispanus, a native of\r\nCompostella, have pursued my education (_expertus ... alumpniam_) in\r\nall Italy, Burgundy, Vienne, Provence, Gascony, and certain parts\r\nof Spain. Certain useful natural phenomena which are not found in\r\nthe bosom of the art of medicine I have discovered by labor, vision,\r\nchance, experience, and genius to be both useful against diseases and\r\nthe causes of diseases; and I have demonstrated certain instructive\r\nexperiments for conserving the safety of the human mechanism, and\r\nI have experienced that all things from the eighth sphere to the\r\nearth’s center are governed by the law of reason (_veridica ratione\r\nhabentur_).” At first, however, the treatise consists of general rules\r\nand precepts for guarding one’s health rather than experiments or\r\nrecipes. Astrology comes in again in the statement that the motion of\r\nthe superior bodies is one of the causes of the shortening of human\r\nlife. Presently the author considers different parts of the body in\r\nturn, as the brain, eyes, ears, teeth, lungs, heart, stomach, liver,\r\nspleen, and feet, and lists things which are good and bad for each.\r\nThings which harm the brain,[1650] for example, are quicksilver, the\r\ncerebellum of all animals except the dog and the fox, fetid odors,\r\ngluttony and drunkenness, sleeping immediately after eating--if the\r\nbrain is weak, bathing after eating, turbid air, worry over temporal\r\naffairs, eating with bent head, and eating a great deal of fish or\r\nmilk, cheese, unripe fruit, and nuts. Among things beneficial for the\r\neyes frequent washing of the feet is suggested.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _A Marvelous Treatise on Waters._]\r\n\r\n_A Marvelous Treatise on Waters which master Petrus Hispanus composed\r\nwith natural industry guided by the intellect_ is found in a number\r\nof manuscripts. Sometimes it appears to be the closing part of his\r\ntreatise on diseases of the eyes,[1651] and its first item is “a\r\nmarvelous water to preserve and clarify the sight.” But it also is\r\nfound as a separate treatise, in which directions are given for\r\ndistilling various liquids, which in at least one manuscript are\r\naccompanied by two figures of chemical apparatus.[1652] In another\r\nmanuscript the word _philosophus_ is substituted for _master Petrus\r\nHispanus_ in the title given at the beginning of this paragraph, but\r\nthe treatise is presumably the same.[1653] In this case, at least, it\r\nseems to include exactly twelve waters[1654] and so to conform to\r\nother medieval books _Of twelve waters_, of which we treat further in\r\nanother chapter.[1655] Also its last two “waters” are an elixir of life\r\nand alcohol.[1656] If Peter of Spain came from Compostella, he may have\r\nhad something to do with a _Book of Compostella, which treats of many\r\nwaters and of many oils and of many salts of great virtue_. However,\r\nBrother Bonaventura, a Franciscan, is said to have composed the book in\r\nthe convent of the Brothers of St. Mary in Venice.[1657]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Other works ascribed to him.]\r\n\r\nA _Rule of Health_[1658] and a _Rule of Safety through all the\r\nmonths_,[1659] which are ascribed to Peter in still other manuscripts,\r\nvery likely have some connection with the above-mentioned _Summa\r\nde conservanda sanitate_ or with the _Letter to Frederick on the\r\nRule of Health_ which has also been mentioned earlier in this\r\nchapter. A treatise on anatomy is attributed to Peter in an Italian\r\nmanuscript,[1660] and a _Book of Life and Death and of the Causes\r\nof Longevity and Brevity of Life_ is listed as his in an Oxford\r\nmanuscript.[1661] Perhaps the shortest work ascribed to him is one\r\nof seven verses on rain.[1662] Commentaries by him on one or more of\r\nthe following works are contained in a manuscript at Paris:[1663]\r\nthe _Introduction_ of Johannitius (Honein or Hunain ibn Ishak)\r\nto the _Ars parva_ of Galen, the _Prognostics_ of Hippocrates,\r\nPhilaretus concerning the pulse, Theophilus on urines, the _Aphorisms_\r\nof Hippocrates, the _Microtegni_ itself. A _Liber naturalis de\r\nrebus principalibus naturarum_ is ascribed to Peter in a Vienna\r\nmanuscript.[1664]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Commentaries on Isaac’s _Diets_: their scholastic method.]\r\n\r\nWe come finally to Peter’s Commentaries upon the works of Isaac on\r\n_Universal Diets_ and _Particular Diets_.[1665] They are as full as the\r\n_Thesaurus pauperum_ was abbreviated and as scholastic and dialectical\r\nin form as it was empirical. Where Isaac’s text is clear Peter leaves\r\nits meaning to the reader’s industry,[1666] but it suggests to him\r\nover a thousand further questions which he takes up one after the\r\nother, listing authorities _pro_ and _con_ in each case and rebutting\r\nor reconciling them. Here we see the handiwork of the author of the\r\nfavorite manual of logic of the later middle ages. The systematic,\r\nbut abstract, sophistical, and jejune character of this method may be\r\nsufficiently illustrated by quotation of the closing passage of the\r\n“First Lecture” (_Lectio prima_).[1667]\r\n\r\n“Next we proceed to the fourth point and inquire whether any food can\r\nbe found of like nature to our bodies. And it would seem so, since when\r\nfoods are called temperate and equal, they are not called equal except\r\nwith respect to the body. But certain foods, such as chicken meat and\r\nthe like, are called temperate and equal; therefore it is possible to\r\nfind food of like nature to our bodies.”\r\n\r\n“Against this three arguments are advanced. The first is that it is\r\nimpossible to associate or join two different individuals; therefore a\r\nplant which grows in the earth and an animal cannot be joined and made\r\none. The second argument is that nothing which is at first contrary\r\nand at last similar is of like nature to our bodies; but such is food,\r\naccording to Aristotle, therefore no food is at all like. The third\r\nargument is that nothing far removed from human nature in constitution\r\nand composition and species is in any way like human nature. But all\r\nfood is of this sort; therefore no food at all resembles the nature of\r\nour bodies, which we concede.”\r\n\r\n“But it should be said anent these opposing arguments that ‘like’ may\r\nbe understood in two senses. Either it means alike in all respects,\r\nand so no food is like. In the second sense, it means that it makes\r\nno manifest impression on the body, and in this sense some foods are\r\ncalled of like nature, such as chicken.”\r\n\r\n“Next it is asked whether human flesh is nourishing, since nutriment\r\ngoes by likeness. And it would seem so, for Isaac says that man is\r\nnot nourished by the elements, since he is too far removed from them.\r\nTherefore that flesh which approaches closest to human nature should\r\nbe the most nutritious. But this is human flesh; hence human flesh\r\nshould be very nutritious. Here is another argument. Nutriment is\r\nfrom likeness, and from equal nutriment comes a well-balanced state\r\nof health; now the human constitution is especially temperate and\r\nwell-balanced; therefore it requires temperate and equal food, and\r\nsuch, some agree, is human flesh. We, however, call it the worst sort\r\nof nutriment for two reasons: one, its corrruptibility; the other, its\r\nexcessive unctuosity. For as the flesh of the body endures by virtue\r\nof the presence of the soul, so after the spirit’s departure the flesh\r\nbecomes moist, vile, and fetid; and herein lies the solution of the\r\ndifficulty, since if it is temperate, it has this property from the\r\nsoul while it exists in the body.”\r\n\r\nAs to what the effect would be of eating men alive, Peter does not\r\nstate. His argument may have possessed an additional interest for his\r\nown time from the possibility of applying it in theological as well as\r\nmedical matters,--for example, the sacrament of the Eucharist.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Their questions concerning nature.]\r\n\r\nMany of the questions raised by Peter are concrete enough, however, and\r\nsupply, not only some definite information on the history of domestic\r\nscience and of the medieval table, but also interesting illustration\r\nof the scope of that medieval curiosity concerning nature to which\r\nwe have more than once adverted. Such questions continue the type of\r\nnatural science of which the _Problems_ of Aristotle and the _Natural\r\nQuestions_ of Adelard of Bath are earlier instances. Those of Peter\r\nare the more impressive in that some of them are far removed from the\r\nsubject of diet at all strictly interpreted. The following is a list of\r\nsuch representative questions picked out here and there throughout the\r\ncommentaries on both the works of Isaac on diet.\r\n\r\n Can natural death be retarded?\r\n\r\n Is a well-balanced constitution the best preserved, or is it\r\n easily overcome by the causes of disease?\r\n\r\n Is bad food more injurious than bad air?\r\n\r\n Why do we employ foods hot in the fourth degree and not\r\n those cold in the same degree?\r\n\r\n What should be the diet of those taking mental exercise,\r\n like students?\r\n\r\n Why is man less hairy and of weaker constitution than the\r\n brutes?\r\n\r\n Why does nature sustain a multitude of medicines, but not of\r\n foods?\r\n\r\n Are medicines always contraries?\r\n\r\n How can animals who eat poisons be food for men?\r\n\r\n Why in some foods is the liquid substance of the same nature\r\n as the solid, and in others not?\r\n\r\n If the spleen causes laughter by purifying the blood, why\r\n isn’t love caused by the gall-bladder?\r\n\r\n Why are the droppings of birds of prey white, of others not?\r\n\r\n Does the blood alone nourish us?\r\n\r\n How do sweet things sour on the stomach?\r\n\r\n Should wine be drunk before or after eating, and immediately\r\n following or long afterwards?\r\n\r\n Is water of more aid than wine in the process of\r\n assimilating food?\r\n\r\n Which satiety is sooner removed, that from fats or from\r\n sweets?\r\n\r\n How do salts possess the virtue of laxatives?\r\n\r\n Why are fish not given in acute fevers?\r\n\r\n Why are compound foods more often injurious than compound\r\n medicines?\r\n\r\n Why are some plants cold and wet when young, hot and sharp\r\n when old?\r\n\r\n Is humidity the formal principle of tastes?\r\n\r\n Is fruit wholesome?\r\n\r\n Why do some plants bear fruit twice a year?\r\n\r\n Why does a branch cut from a plant and placed in earth live,\r\n while the severed limb of an animal will not live?\r\n\r\n Why are animals soft in infancy, and fruits hard?\r\n\r\n What part of water is more truly water: top, bottom, or\r\n middle?\r\n\r\n Is cow meat better eating than ox meat?\r\n\r\n Is the flesh of female animals moister?\r\n\r\n Why in hot regions are the brutes large but the men small,\r\n and in cold countries the contrary?\r\n\r\n Is pork better in summer?\r\n\r\n Is meat cooked in a pie good?[1668]\r\n\r\n Why are the ears of all animals save men and apes in\r\n continual motion?\r\n\r\n Why do sparrows cure epilepsy when they are subject to the\r\n disease themselves?\r\n\r\n Why are pigs’ intestines the best of animals that walk and\r\n geese’s intestines of those that fly?\r\n\r\n Why a small hen lays more eggs than a large one?\r\n\r\n Are eggs or meat better for convalescents?\r\n\r\n Why is white of egg used for wounds?\r\n\r\n Is goats’ milk the best?\r\n\r\n Is human milk subtler than asses’ milk?\r\n\r\n Why do these things go together:--having large flanks\r\n and belly, ruminating, lack of teeth in the upper jaw,\r\n coagulation of the milk, having horns?\r\n\r\n Is butter of a hotter nature than oil?\r\n\r\n Why salt water fish do not have salt flesh?\r\n\r\n Why the dolphin and whale have true blood, albeit they are\r\n fish?\r\n\r\n Why there are larger fish in salt water than fresh?\r\n\r\n Are fish fried in meal better than those not?\r\n\r\n Should paralytics eat fried fish?\r\n\r\n Why should one not eat eggs raw like milk?\r\n\r\n Why the flame of fire takes the figure of a pyramid?\r\n\r\n Why are springs hot in winter and cold in summer?\r\n\r\n Should an interval elapse between the courses of a meal?\r\n\r\n Should drink be taken along with one’s food?\r\n\r\n Should the heartier meal be at mid-day or in the evening?\r\n\r\n Why are other animals than man content with one form of food?\r\n\r\n Why does human urine enrich vines?\r\n\r\n Should fruit be plucked ripe or green?\r\n\r\n Are apples good in fevers?\r\n\r\n Why is wine (cider) made from apples?\r\n\r\n Why does melancholy especially excite the appetite?\r\n\r\n Why do the boxwood, white-fir, and laurel trees retain their\r\n foliage a longer time than others?\r\n\r\n Why in the boxwood, laurel, and olive are the leaves\r\n pointed, in the poplar and other trees wide?\r\n\r\n Is it beneficial to strew myrtle leaves in the sick-room?\r\n\r\n Why is oil best at the top, honey at the bottom, wine in the\r\n middle of the cask?\r\n\r\n Are fungi plants or something between earth and plants?\r\n\r\n Why the weasel seeks rue and rubs itself with it when it\r\n intends to fight a snake?\r\n\r\n Why pepper is good for dimmed eyes?\r\n\r\n Why the water in the sea does not grow less?\r\n\r\n Why the horse, mule, and ass neither nourish man nor harm\r\n him, if he eats them?[1669]\r\n\r\n Why castration improves the conduct of beasts, makes men\r\n worse?[1670]\r\n\r\n Is raw cheese better than cooked, and solid cheese or cheese\r\n with holes in it?\r\n\r\n Why are fools so fond of cheese?\r\n\r\n Why have birds but two feet and no teeth?\r\n\r\n Which is more nourishing, the white or the yolk of an egg?\r\n\r\n Why travelers should eschew fish?\r\n\r\n Whether the water that we drink is the element?[1671]\r\n\r\n Which is better, standing or running water?\r\n\r\n Why wine affects the tongue more than the other members?\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Absence of astrology and occult virtue.]\r\n\r\nSome of the questions which Peter raises one might expect him to\r\nsolve by an appeal to occult virtue, sympathy and antipathy existing\r\nbetween things in nature, or the superior influence of the stars.\r\nThis, however, he almost never does; his reasoning is based rather on\r\nthe prevalence of the four qualities, hot and cold, dry and moist, in\r\nnatural objects. Thus the property of dove’s blood of removing spots\r\nfrom the eye is attributed to its heat and humidity, not to any occult\r\npower.[1672] And sparrows, although epileptics themselves, are said to\r\ncure epilepsy because they are very hot and dry and consume the humors\r\nor vapors which cause epilepsy, not by antipathy or because like cures\r\nlike.[1673] Even less does one note any instances of ligatures and\r\nsuspensions, characters and incantations. One or two passages show,\r\nhowever, that Peter believes in occult virtue and the rule of the\r\nstars. He states that in addition to the four simple elements “there\r\nis another simplicity ... namely, from qualities, and it is not in\r\nthe elements but in the celestial bodies.”[1674] And in his prologue\r\nto the _Particular Diets_ he affirms that celestials are the cause of\r\ninferiors and quotes the words addressed by God to the stars in Plato’s\r\n_Timaeus_, “O gods of gods, whose father and creator I am, by your\r\nnature you are dissoluble but by my will indissoluble,” to prove how\r\nmuch more corruptible inferior bodies are.[1675]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Incorrect ideas about Nature.]\r\n\r\nDespite the almost complete absence of superstitious practices and of\r\nastrological and magical doctrine from the _Commentaries on Isaac_ it\r\nis of course true that Peter harbors many incorrect notions such as\r\nthat fish lack bones and that hot water freezes harder and quicker\r\nthan cold.[1676] This last, however, he supports by the authority\r\nand arguments of Aristotle and Avicenna. Peter also throughout the\r\nwork displays faith in the validity of compound medicines, although\r\nhe raises the suggestive question, why compound foods are more often\r\ninjurious than compound medicines. He also accepts various stories of\r\nanimal remedies and sagacity for which he finds support in Aristotle’s\r\n_History of Animals_, such as that the serpent eats fennel to restore\r\nor sharpen its sight,[1677] and that the bone in the heart of the\r\nstag is especially beneficial for heart disease because “the stag is\r\nvery ingenious and astute and so eats potent herbs which especially\r\naffect the heart like parsley and origanum,” and from these the bone\r\nforms.[1678] In explaining why deer shed their horns and hide them,\r\nPeter incorrectly makes Aristotle say that they secrete the right horn\r\nwith more care, whereas the _History of Animals_ states, “It is said\r\nthat no one has ever seen the left horn, for he conceals it as if it\r\nhad some medicinal (or, magic) power.”[1679]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Reason and experience.]\r\n\r\nFinally, despite the scholastic form of Peter’s Commentary, it contains\r\na long passage on the importance of experimental method or “the way of\r\nexperience” (_via experimenti_),[1680] f which it couples with “the\r\npath of reason” (_via rationis_) as the two methods by which dietary\r\nscience may be investigated. First Peter distinguishes between the two,\r\nthen shows the necessity of the way of experience, and third that it\r\ncan and should be confirmed by reason. Galen says that experience is\r\nweak without reason, and so is reason when not joined to experience.\r\nSome say that reason should precede experience, that first we should\r\nseek rationally, then test by experience. In any case the way of\r\nexperience proceeds through effects, the way of reason through causes.\r\nThe one method is inductive; the other, syllogistic; the one based\r\non immediate effects, the other on mediate effects. “Experimental\r\nmethod pays no attention to causes; rational method considers causes\r\nand principles; experience makes use of the senses; reason, of the\r\nintellect” and arguments.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Via experimenti._]\r\n\r\nAfter listing various arguments _pro_ and _con_ as to whether the\r\n_via experiment_ “is of art and in art, or precedes art,” Peter gives\r\nhis solution to the effect that _experimentum_ is threefold. As a\r\nmethod of attaining knowledge it antecedes all arts and sciences. As\r\na method of making known the objects of scientific inquiry, it is a\r\npart of science. As an application of scientific doctrine to practical\r\nlife and industry, it follows science. Furthermore, experience “may\r\nproceed regularly through science and doctrine and in this way it\r\ncan be rational.” Or it may be irregular and not syllogistic in\r\nmethod. The experimental discoveries of brutes, as when the serpent\r\nrestores its sight with fennel, come to them from nature, but ours are\r\nacquired by art and confirmed by reason, although man too possesses\r\nthe experimental instinct. Peter further distinguishes the experiences\r\nof rustics, which are unregulated by reason, from the experiments of\r\nskilled men which are regulated by reason. Moreover, “experiences\r\nare not without their reasons, and idle is the experiment which does\r\nnot rest on reason.” Finally, Peter gives six conditions requisite\r\nin medical experimentation which are somewhat similar to the seven\r\nconditions stated by his contemporary, John of St. Amand. First, the\r\nmedicine administered should be free from all foreign substance.[1681]\r\nSecond, the patient taking it should have the disease for which it is\r\nespecially intended. Third, it should be given alone without admixture\r\nof other medicine. Fourth, it should be of the opposite degree to the\r\ndisease. Fifth, “we should test it not once only but many times.”\r\nSixth, “the experiments should be with the proper body, as on the body\r\nof a man and not of an ass.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Question of Peter’s relation to Roger Bacon and Galen.]\r\n\r\nPeter’s discussion of the _via experimenti_ is in several respects\r\nsimilar to Roger Bacon’s discussion of experimental science, but is\r\nprobably quite independent of it. Peter died before Roger in 1277, and\r\nhis _Commentary on Isaac_ was probably composed before the works which\r\nBacon addressed to the pope in and around the year 1267. The influence\r\nof Galen, who had discussed the part played by reason and experience in\r\nhis own work on food values, upon Peter is fairly evident.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: John of St. Amand on medical experimentation.]\r\n\r\nJohn of St. Amand, to whose similar conditions for medical\r\nexperimentation we just alluded, was a canon of Tournai who seems to\r\nhave written a little later than Peter, since he describes the death\r\nfrom vomiting of a bishop of Tournai which took place in 1261.[1682]\r\nIt is in his commentary on the _Antidotarium_ of Nicolaus that John\r\ngives his seven conditions for medical experimentation. After having\r\nsaid that on account of the scarcity and incompleteness of experience,\r\nwe should sometimes learn the virtues of simple medicines “through\r\ndoctrine,” John for a page or two discusses other matters, but then\r\nreverts to the subject of experimentation. A medicinal simple, he says,\r\nmay be known by two methods, “the way of experience and the way of\r\nreason.” “And because the principles of experience are better known to\r\nus than the principles of reason, let us first inquire concerning the\r\nknowledge of medicinal simples by the way of experience.” He goes on to\r\nsay that experience is twofold as it is supported or not supported by\r\nreason. If unsupported by reason experience or experiment is timorous\r\nand fallacious. As for experience supported by reason, it should\r\nconform to these seven requirements.[1683] First, “the medicinal simple\r\nwhich is being tested should be pure and free from every extraneous\r\nquality, lest by such extraneous quality the proper operation of the\r\nmedicine be impeded, and in consequence experimental knowledge.”[1684]\r\nHere the use of the adjective, “experimental” is interesting. Second,\r\nthe experimentation should be with a simple and not a complicated\r\ndisease.[1685] Third, the simple should be tested in two contrary types\r\nof disease, because sometimes a medicine cures one disease by its\r\n“complexion” or elemental properties and another by its occult virtue.\r\nThus scammony cures both quotidian and tertian fever; the first because\r\nscammony is of a hot nature; but the second by its occult virtue and\r\nnot because scammony is of a cold nature, for it is not.[1686] Fourth,\r\nthe virtue of the medicine should correspond to the quality of the\r\npatient. Fifth, essence and accident should not be confused; water,\r\nfor example, may be heated, but is not of a hot nature.[1687] Sixth,\r\nthe experiment should be often repeated. For if a medicine is tested\r\nin the cases of five men and has a heating effect upon them all, still\r\nthat is not adequate proof that it will always have a heating effect,\r\nfor they may have all been of a cold or temperate constitution, whereas\r\na man of hot nature would not be heated by the simple in question.\r\nSeventh, the test should be on the human body and in varying states of\r\nhealth. Trying the medicine upon a lion may not prove anything as to\r\nits effect upon a man.[1688] John seems to have taken his conditions\r\ndirectly from Galen rather than from Petrus Hispanus, since only three\r\nof them are identical with Peter’s, whereas all but one occur in his\r\nown _Concordances_ from Galen’s works.[1689] John of St. Amand repeats\r\nthe experiment with the hazel rod which we have already encountered in\r\nWilliam of Auvergne. According to John the two split halves tend to\r\nreunite because it is natural for them to be together, but he adds that\r\nsome old women make use of it with utterance of a useless incantation\r\nas a matrimonial charm, asserting that if the halves unite, the\r\nmarriage will be a happy one.[1690]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Natural and occult science in John of St. Amand.]\r\n\r\nIt was not my intention to speak of John of St. Amand further than\r\nto compare his remarks on experimental method with those of Petrus\r\nHispanus, but the _Histoire Littéraire_ has already presented some\r\nspecimens of his views, which it will be worth repeating to show\r\nthat his experimental tendency has the same accompaniment of mingled\r\ncredulity and scepticism and of occult science and signs of magic\r\nas we have noted in other cases. Thus he rejects the story that the\r\nbeaver castrates itself to escape the pursuit of hunters on the\r\nground that the animal has not that much sense, but believes that\r\nbeavers enslave one another. From the fact that herons are subject\r\nto diarrhoea he argues that men with long necks and legs should not\r\nresort to purgatives, and he states that pearls comfort the heart by\r\nsimilarity, since they are hard like the heart. He enters into long and\r\nobscure explanations how it is that application of the flesh of a snake\r\nextracts the venom from its bite, and “is not exempt from astrological\r\nideas.”[1691] But the writings of John of St. Amand have carried us\r\nwell along into the second half of the thirteenth century; in the next\r\nchapter we must turn back to a man whose literary activity began in the\r\nErst half of that century, Albertus Magnus.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1614] _Ptolemaei Lucensis Historia Ecclesiastica.

I have used the 1497 edition,--_Summa Experimentorum sive\r\nthesaurus pauperum magistri Petri yspani, Antwerpiae, Theodoricus\r\nMartini, 1497 (die 22 Mai)_. A letter lying loose in the copy (numbered\r\nIB. 50018) which I read at the British Museum, stated that the copy\r\nat Liège is (was) the same. I also consulted the edition printed at\r\nFrankfurt in 1578 but it seemed faulty compared with the 1497 edition.\r\nFor a list of MSS see Appendix I at the close of this chapter.\r\n\r\n[1627] Stapper (1898), p. 23.\r\n\r\n[1628] Sloane 284, Harleian 5218, Additional 25,000 contain the\r\nsentence; Sloane 521 and 2479, and Royal 12 B III do not have it. The\r\nentire preface is missing in Addit. 22,636 and in the early MS, Sloane\r\n477, but it also has no _Incipit_ and a first sheet may well be missing\r\nwhich contained the preface.\r\n\r\n[1629] The sentence as Stapper gives it (p. 24), reads: “_Litteras\r\nautem quas aliquando ponunt physici superstitiose positas nemo credat,\r\nsed quia immediatius operantur vel magis assidue, sicut dextrum\r\ndextro vel sinistrum sinistro membro et masculo apponitur._” In\r\nthe 1497 edition and Sloane 284 the sentence reads more correctly:\r\n“_Ligaturas autem quas aliquando posuerunt philosophi nemo credat\r\nsuperstitiose positas, sed immo quod (ideo quia) immediatius operantur\r\nvel magis assidue si (vel aliter) numquam deponuntur vel a simili\r\nsicut si ad (aliud) dextrum dextro membro vel sinistrum sinistro vel\r\nmasculinum masculino apponatur._” In the 1578 edition the sentence has\r\nbeen completely changed and begins: “_Characteres vero et de collo\r\nsuspendenda quorum interdum a Philosophis sit mentio nemo arbitretur\r\nsuperstitiose tradita esse sed ideo quia immediate operantur vel magis\r\nper_ ἀντιπάθειαν...” etc.\r\n\r\n[1630] For instance, among remedies for sore throat an herb “divinely\r\nrevealed to good bishop Boniface” and “a good prayer” were detailed in\r\nthe 1497 edition, but I failed to find them in Sloane 477, Sloane 2479,\r\nAdditional 32,622, or Royal 12-B-III. The next remedy after the good\r\nprayer was given in Sloane 477 only in the margin, but in Additional\r\n32,622 appeared in the body of the text. In the chapter on toothache,\r\ntoo, a remedy written in the margin in a different ink from the text of\r\nSloane 477 is embodied in the text of Sloane 521 and 2479 as well as in\r\nthe 1497 edition.\r\n\r\n[1631] Gilbert of England’s _Compendium_ adopted essentially that order.\r\n\r\n[1632] See also CLM 457, 15th century, fol. 112-, De febribus. Sunt\r\naliqua capitula ex thesauro pauperum Hispani Petri.\r\n\r\n[1633] Sloane 521 and Addit. 32,622 omit “occult.”\r\n\r\n[1634] Even in an early MS like Sloane 477 we find the first person\r\nused a great deal and experience or “experiments” often mentioned.\r\n\r\n[1635] Sloane 2479, fol. 37v, fol. 14r, fol. 13v; and in other MSS.\r\n\r\n[1636] These remedies for toothache will all be found in Sloane 477 and\r\n2479, Addit. 32,622, and Royal 12-B-III, as well as in the 1497 edition.\r\n\r\n[1637] 28, 49 and 30, 8.\r\n\r\n[1638] Sloane 477, fol. 9r.\r\n\r\n[1639] Sloane 2479, fol. 14v; Addit. 25,000, fol. 79v; Addit. 32,622,\r\nunder the heading “_De spasmo_.”\r\n\r\n[1640] Sloane 477, fol. 10r does not cite Constantine and Walter, but\r\nother MSS do.\r\n\r\n[1641] Sloane 2479, fol. 14v; Royal 12-B-III, fol. 19v; Addit. 25,000,\r\nfol. 79v; Harleian 5218.\r\n\r\n[1642] All the items mentioned in this paragraph are found in the\r\nearly MS Sloane 477 as well as in other MSS. In a fifteenth century\r\nMS at Florence (Ashburnham 143, fols. 113-14), this chapter appears\r\nseparately as, “_Capitulum pulcrum pro maleficiis malis_” and under\r\nthe further sub-titles, “_De hiis qui maleficiis impediti cum uxoribus\r\ncohire non possunt. Pro maleficiis destruendis secundum magistrum\r\nPetrum Yspanum._”\r\n\r\n[1643] For the _De morbis oculorum_ I have used two MSS. in the British\r\nMuseum; Sloane 1214, 15th century, fols. 38-46, and Sloane 2268, 14th\r\ncentury, fols. 52-59. I presume that Gonville and Caius 379, 13th\r\ncentury, fols. 142-49, “Secreta mag. Petri yspani ad oculos. In nomine\r\nsummi opificii/acceptis de pectine matris,” is the same work.\r\n\r\n[1644] Sloane 1214, fol. 38r; Sloane 2268, fol. 52.\r\n\r\n[1645] Sloane 2268, fol. 54v.\r\n\r\n[1646] _Op. cit._ (1901).\r\n\r\n[1647] Sloane 1214, fol. 38r.\r\n\r\n[1648] Sloane 2268, fol. 54v.

L. Pagel, _Die\r\nConcordanciae des Johannes de Sancto Amando_, Berlin, 1894, and\r\n_Nachträge zu den Concordanciae des Johannes de Sancto Amando_, Berlin,\r\n1896. For the _Expositio in Antidotarium Nicolai_, I have followed the\r\ntext in _Mesuae medici clarissimi opera_, Venice, 1568; but there are\r\nearlier editions, such as Venice, 1497, and Lyons, 1533.\r\n\r\n[1683] _Expositio in Antidotarium Nicolai_ (1568), fol. 231, “Sed\r\nmedicina simplex duplici via cognoscitur scilicet via experimenti et\r\nvia rationis.... Et quia principia experimenti sunt nobis magis nota\r\nquam principia rationis, ideo prius inquiramus cognitionem simplicium\r\nmedicinarum via experimenti ... duplex est experimentum ... vallatum\r\net non vallatum ratione, tunc ipsum est timorosum et fallax si non sit\r\nvallatum ratione....”\r\n\r\n[1684] _Ibid._, “Oportet ut medicina simplex quae experiatur sit pura\r\net munda ab omni extranea qualitate, ne per illam extraneam qualitatem\r\nimpediatur propria operatio medicinae, et per consequens cognitio\r\nexperimentalis.” This is the same as Peter’s first condition. Also as\r\nthe passage from Galen’s _Medicinal Simples_, II, 5, quoted in John’s\r\n_Concordances_, “Oportet quod res quae experitur sit pura et denudata\r\nab omni qualitate accidentali....”\r\n\r\n[1685] I do not note this condition among Peter’s nor in the\r\n_Concordances_.\r\n\r\n[1686] “Oportet quod medicina simplex experiatur in duabus contrariis\r\naegritudinibus diversis, sicut scamonea in quotidiana et tertiana, ipsa\r\nenim curat quotidianam ex sua complexione, tertianam ex proprietate\r\nsua, tamen non sequitur, scamonea curat tertianam, ergo est frigida;\r\nsed sequitur, ipsa ex sua complexione curat quotidianam, ergo est\r\ncalida.”\r\n\r\nThe use of the word “proprietas” for occult virtue is found also in\r\nArnald of Villanova and other medieval writers.\r\n\r\n[1687] John’s third, fourth and fifth conditions do not exactly\r\ncorrespond to any of Peter’s, but are contained in the following\r\nquotation from Galen (_simpl. med._ I, 2) in the _Concordances_. “Ad\r\nhoc ut res recte experiatur, tria requiruntur: 1m est ut experiatur in\r\nre ad quam comparatur, ut helleborus in coturnice non in homine; 2m\r\nrequiritur ut distinguamus inter opus quod facit res per se et quod\r\nfacit per accidens; 3m oportet cavere ne complexio actualis obnubilet\r\npotentialem et de omnibus his exempla ponit.”\r\n\r\n[1688] “experimentum in corpore humano et primo in temperato, postea\r\nin lapso, et postea in aegro.” These last two conditions correspond\r\nto Peter’s last two and are also duplicated in John’s _Concordances_\r\nfrom Galen: “Si videris 5 vel 6 homines qualibet medicina mobiles,\r\nexperimento solo non potuisti certiorare ilia medicina omnes homines\r\nposse moveri.... Oportet cum res experitur ut primo experiatur in\r\ncorpore temperato et postea in intemperate.”\r\n\r\n[1689] See the foregoing footnotes and Pagel’s text (1894), pp. 102-4.\r\n\r\n[1690] _Expositio in Antidotarium Nicolai_, fol. 268, “... et hoc\r\npatet per experimentum accipiatur virga coryli recens et scindatur per\r\nmedium medullae et ponatur frustum unum in manu una et aliud in alia\r\nmanu, adinvicem coniungentur et hoc est quia unam alteri natum est\r\nconjungi naturaliter quia ex eis fiebat naturaliter unum conjunctum, et\r\nideo unum natum est alteri conjungi excitatum per virtutem alterius.\r\nEt per illud faciunt vetulae carmen suum in matrimonium: dicunt enim\r\nquod quando aliquis desponsat aliquam, quod illae virgae coryli si\r\nconjungantur matrimonium erit ad bonum, si non, non: sed dicunt carmen\r\naliquid operari ad hoc quod nisi dicerent, conjungerentur tarnen sive\r\nad bonum sive ad malum.”\r\n\r\n[1691] HL XXI, 263-5.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX I\r\n\r\nSOME MANUSCRIPTS OF THE THESAURUS PAUPERUM\r\n\r\n\r\nI have examined the following MSS of the work in the collections in\r\nthe British Museum. As usual, the dating of the MSS is not my own, but\r\neither that given in the catalogues of the collections or in the MSS\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\n Sloane 282, quarto, 15th century, fols. 87-105, Petri\r\n   Hispani, postea Johannis Papae XXI, Thesaurus pauperum.\r\n\r\n Sloane 284, 15th century, fols. 129-174. “Incipit liber qui\r\n   thesaurus pauperum nominatur compositus a magistro P.\r\n   Hispano Papa Johanne postmodum.”\r\n\r\n Sloane 477, dated Sept. 30, 1309. Fol. 79r, “Explicit\r\n   thesaurus pauperum ad honorem dei et hominum ipsius operis\r\n   exigentium. Anno domine mill’o tricentessimo nono die\r\n   tricessimo mense septembris hoc opus complevi scripsi\r\n   presbitur N. De. Machia Anconitana hunc scripsit librum\r\n   cui Christus filius dei et virginis matris marie det sibi\r\n   gratiam consolationem anime et corpori. Amen.” Then in\r\n   different ink is added, “Explicit thesaurus pauperum vel\r\n   summa experimentorum medicinalium magistri petri Hispani.”\r\n   This MS, which seems as early as any that I examined,\r\n   is written on small pages in large print-like letters.\r\n   The red ink of the text has faded and is accompanied by\r\n   numerous notes in small black writing.\r\n\r\n Sloane 521, 14th-15th century, fols. 46-74. “Explicit summa\r\n   Petri Hispanensis experimentorum medicinalium, cujus libri\r\n   posuit nomen thesaurus pauperum.

Of recent years a bewildering\r\nunderbrush of German monographs has sprung up concerning Albert as one\r\nof the few prominent persons that Germany could claim as its own among\r\nthe many scholars of the medieval period.\r\n\r\nA number of works that do not deal primarily with Albert will be\r\ncited in the course of the chapter rather than here, and mention of\r\nhis individual works and of manuscripts of them will also be found in\r\nconnection with the following text.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. _His Own Writings_\r\n\r\n M.

My references are regularly to\r\n   this edition.

Stadler\r\n   from the Cologne autograph MS in Beiträge z. Gesch. d.\r\n   Philos, d. Mittelalters, vols. 15-16, is the only one\r\n   of a work with which we are concerned. Stadler attempts\r\n   to distinguish Albert’s additions from Aristotle’s\r\n   text and to trace their sources. German criticism\r\n   of the genuineness of large portions of the text of\r\n   Aristotle’s Historia animalium has in my opinion been\r\n   carried altogether too far and based upon the gratuitous\r\n   assumption that Aristotle would not have said anything\r\n   superstitious.

The length of his life\r\nand presumably also of his period of literary productivity makes it\r\ndifficult to place him at any particular point in the century, and from\r\nthe fact that Vincent of Beauvais and Peter of Spain cite him we might\r\nwell have placed our account of his works before theirs. He appears,\r\nhowever, to have outlived them both. But it is mainly in order to bring\r\nour account of Albert into juxtaposition with our treatment of the\r\nother two great names of Thomas Aquinas and Roger Bacon, to determine\r\nwhether the _Speculum astronomiae_ should be ascribed to Roger rather\r\nthan Albert, and to treat of books of experiments and magic, that have\r\nbeen ascribed to Albert but are perhaps of somewhat later date, in\r\nconnection with other similar experimental and occult literature, that\r\nwe have postponed our consideration of Albertus Magnus until this point.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Albert and Aquinas.]\r\n\r\nIn 1253, the same year that Robert Grosseteste died, four years after\r\nWilliam of Auvergne, opened the pontificate of Alexander IV, of which\r\nPtolemy of Lucca wrote: “In his time flourished two great doctors\r\nin the Order of Preachers. Doubtless many others were famous during\r\nthis same time both in life and doctrine. But these two transcended\r\nand deserve to be placed before all others.”[1692] The two Dominicans\r\nwhom Ptolemy had in mind were, of course, Albertus Magnus and Thomas\r\nAquinas.[1693] It is customary and natural to couple their names.\r\nBesides being members of the same order, they were master and student;\r\nthey were also the two scholars of their time who did most to adapt\r\nthe natural philosophy of Aristotle to Christian use, a fact which in\r\nitself suggests their interest in natural science. It may seem strange\r\nto us today that two theologians, and even more so two members of an\r\norder vowed to asceticism, apostolic poverty, and the maintenance\r\nof strict orthodoxy against heresy, should play a leading part in\r\ninterpreting the ideas of Greek and Arabic philosophers and should\r\ndisplay such an interest in natural science. The fact, however, is\r\nindisputable. It is to the credit of the medieval church and its\r\nreligious orders. But it is even more a tribute to the power that\r\nphilosophy and natural science exercise upon every able mind that\r\nreally studies them. As for the relations between Albert and Aquinas,\r\nit must be added that while the former outlived his pupil, he was born\r\na full generation before him. It was thus Aquinas who profited by and\r\nbuilt upon Albert’s work.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Dates of birth and death.]\r\n\r\nPtolemy of Lucca states that Albertus Magnus was over eighty years\r\nold when he died in 1280, and that for about three years before his\r\ndeath he largely lost control of his intellectual faculties.[1694]\r\nThat he outlived his pupil Aquinas by six years, and that his writings\r\nare cited by other contemporaries who died before he did--Vincent of\r\nBeauvais and Petrus Hispanus, are other indications of his longevity.\r\nThere consequently seems little reason for questioning the traditional\r\ndate of his birth, 1193, although Pouchet has suggested 1205[1695]\r\nand Father Mandonnet, more recently, 1206.[1696] The main argument\r\nfor placing his birth about 1206 is that a fourteenth century\r\nchronicler[1697] states that he was only sixteen when he entered the\r\nDominican Order, while in the fifteenth century Peter of Prussia\r\nasserts that Albert himself used to say that he had been in the Order\r\n“from his very boyhood.”[1698] His birthplace was at Lauingen in Swabia\r\nand he was the oldest son of the count of Bollstädt.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Early life.]\r\n\r\nAlbert studied at Padua, where he tells us that in his youth he\r\nsaw a well which exhaled a deadly vapor,[1699] while at Venice he\r\nbeheld a royal figure painted by nature upon marble.[1700] He perhaps\r\nentered the Dominican Order in 1222 or 1223. According to Peter of\r\nPrussia,[1701] a few years later he was made reader or lecturer of the\r\nfriars at Cologne and “twice gloriously lectured on the _Sentences_.”\r\nThen he was successively _Lector_ at Hildesheim in 1233, at Freiburg,\r\nfor two years in Ratisbon, and at Strasburg. Albert alludes in his\r\nworks to a comet which he saw in Saxony in 1240.[1702]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Probable early date of some of his works.]\r\n\r\nAlthough Ptolemy of Lucca mentions Albert and Aquinas as flourishing\r\nduring the pontificate of Alexander IV, 1253-1261, much of the former’s\r\nwriting as well as teaching probably antedates this. Presumably he\r\nwas already famous when young Aquinas came all the way from Italy to\r\nCologne or Paris to study with him about 1244 or 1245. If the _Speculum\r\nnaturale_ of Vincent of Beauvais was written by 1250, many of Albert’s\r\nwritings which it freely cites must have appeared before that date, for\r\ninstance, the _De anima_ (III, 41), _De sensu et sensato_ (V. 108), _De\r\nsomno et vigilia_ (XXVI, 23), _De animalibus_ (XVII, 71). The treatise\r\non sleep and waking is found in a manuscript written in a French hand\r\nin 1258.[1703] Even in the treatise on minerals,[1704] which has been\r\nregarded as written after 1250 because Vincent of Beauvais does not\r\ncite it, and in which Albert speaks of having been in Paris as well\r\nas Cologne, he also speaks of one of his associates who saw in the\r\npossession of the emperor, Frederick II, 1212-1250, a magnet which\r\ninstead of attracting iron was drawn to that metal.[1705] On the other\r\nhand, in his work on animals Albert cites the emperor Frederick’s\r\nbook on falcons, so that Albert’s treatise on animals was probably not\r\nfinished until at least the latter part of that monarch’s reign.[1706]\r\nBut even Mandonnet who delays Albert’s birth to 1206 believes that\r\nhis first writings date back to 1240 and that his great philosophical\r\nworks began to appear about 1245. I should be inclined to push these\r\ndates back ten or twenty years. Albert was probably teaching at Paris\r\nfrom about 1245 to 1248, in which year he signed the condemnation of\r\nthe _Talmud_ in that city and then became regent of the new school at\r\nCologne established by the Dominicans.[1707]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Events of his life after 1250.]\r\n\r\nThe two chief ecclesiastical offices held by Albert were those of\r\nprovincial of his order in Germany from 1254 to 1257, and of bishop\r\nof Ratisbon, 1260-1262. He resigned from both positions, apparently\r\npreferring the scholar’s life. Ptolemy of Lucca explains that German\r\nbishops had to use the sword too much for Albert’s taste. In his\r\nwork on animals Albert alludes in one passage to his villa on the\r\nDanube.[1708] In 1256 he went to Rome to defend the friars against the\r\nattacks of William of St. Amour, and while in Italy discovered the _De\r\nmotibus animalium_ of Aristotle. In his theological _Summa_ he speaks\r\nof having collected the material for his treatise _On the Unity of\r\nthe Intellect against Averroes_, when he was “in the _curia_ at the\r\ncommand of Lord Alexander the Pope.”[1709] In 1259, when the general\r\nchapter of the Dominicans met at Valenciennes, he was appointed upon\r\na committee to draw up a course of study for the Order along with\r\nAquinas and Pietro di Tarantasia, who in 1276 became Pope Innocent V.\r\nAfter resigning the bishopric of Ratisbon in 1262, Albert returned to\r\nteaching at Cologne, but in 1263 he preached the crusade in Germany and\r\nBohemia, and his name appears in documents at Würzburg in that year\r\nand those immediately following.[1710] In his _Politics_ he speaks of\r\nhaving been papal _nuncius_ in Saxony and Poland, where he found the\r\nbarbaric custom still observed of killing the old men of the tribe when\r\nthey had outlived their period of usefulness.[1711] We are told that in\r\n1270 he despatched a treatise to Paris to help Aquinas in connection\r\nwith the affair of Siger de Brabant, and in 1277 visited that city\r\nagain in person to defend his own Aristotelian teaching and the memory\r\nof Aquinas in connection with the condemnation by Stephen Tempier,\r\nbishop of Paris, and other doctors of 219 opinions ascribed to the\r\nsame Siger de Brabant and others,[1712]--an affair of which we shall\r\nhave more to say later. The Catholic Encyclopedia and _Dictionnaire\r\nd’histoire et de géographie ecclésiastique_ repeat the assertion of\r\nfifteenth century biographers that Albert attended the Council of\r\nLyons in 1274, but the _Histoire Littéraire de la France_ eighty years\r\nago assured us that his name is not mentioned in the records of that\r\nassembly.[1713]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Albert at Cologne.]\r\n\r\nThis brief account of Albert’s life has made it evident that he stayed\r\nin no one place for long at a time, and his own works show that he\r\nhad traveled widely. He seems, however, to have returned repeatedly\r\nto Cologne, and to have passed more time there than at any other one\r\nplace. There he saw ruined remains of Roman buildings excavated;[1714]\r\nthere he says that he wrote his _De natura locorum_;[1715] and there\r\nother of his writings, partly in his own hand, were still treasured\r\nwhen Peter of Prussia wrote his life near the close of the fifteenth\r\ncentury.[1716]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Contemporary estimates of Albert.]\r\n\r\nWe have seen that Albert was already cited as an authority during his\r\nlifetime by such writers as Petrus Hispanus and Vincent of Beauvais.\r\nRoger Bacon in 1267 mentioned “Brother Albert of the Order of Friars\r\nPreachers” and William of Shyrwood as two of the foremost scholars\r\nof the time, although he seems rather jealous of Albert and inclined\r\nto rank William of Shyrwood and of course himself above him.[1717]\r\nSuch envy only proves the great reputation that Albert had. In the\r\n_Summa philosophiae_ ascribed to Grosseteste but which we have seen\r\nwas apparently written some years after his death, following a long\r\nlist of ancient and Arabian philosophers and some comparatively modern\r\nChristian writers such as Gundissalinus, Constantinus, and Alfred of\r\nEngland, the author mentions as even “more modern” Alexander minor,\r\npresumably Alexander of Hales the Franciscan who died in 1245, and\r\nAlbert of Cologne of the Order of Preachers. He regards them as\r\ndistinguished philosophers but not to be held for authorities. However,\r\nhe later prefers Albert’s explanation of the virtues of gems to those\r\nof Democritus, Pythagoras, Plato, Hermes, and Avicenna. He also\r\ncalls Albert “the most famous of modern theologians,” and gives his\r\narguments against vision being by extramission.[1718] Ulrich Engelbert\r\nof Strasburg, a contemporary and pupil of Albert, in the fourth book\r\nof his _Summa theologiae_ described “my lord Albert, once bishop of\r\nRatisbon,” as “a man in every science so divine that he may well be\r\ncalled the wonder and miracle of our time.”[1719] Thomas of Cantimpré,\r\nin his moralizing _Bonum universale de apibus_, a farrago of monkish\r\ngossip and incredible tales, written apparently in 1276 or shortly\r\nafter, emphasizes the saintly character of Albert who is apparently\r\nwell along in years when Thomas writes.[1720] He represents Albert as\r\nhaving told him that at Paris a demon appeared to him in the likeness\r\nof a certain friar in an attempt to keep him from his studies but\r\ndeparted at the sign of the cross.[1721] Or again Thomas assures us\r\nthat as Albert’s auditor for a considerable time when he occupied the\r\nchair of theology he had seen for himself and “most certainly tested”\r\nhow Albert for many years almost daily participated in the prayers\r\nby day and night and read the psalter of David and often sweated\r\nin religious contemplation and meditation. “What wonder,” piously\r\nejaculates Thomas, “that a man of such whole-hearted devotion and piety\r\nshould show superhuman attainments in science!”[1722]\r\n\r\n\r\nII. _As a Scientist_\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The scope of Albert’s scientific treatises.]\r\n\r\nIt may be well at the start to indicate the scope and character of\r\nAlbert’s works in the field of science. In general they follow the plan\r\nof the natural philosophy of Aristotle and parallel the titles of the\r\nworks then attributed, in some cases incorrectly, to Aristotle. We have\r\neight books of physics, psychological treatises such as the _De anima_\r\nand _De somno et vigilia_, both in three books, and works dealing with\r\ncelestial phenomena, such as the _De meteoris_ and _De coelo et mundo_\r\nin four books each, and with the universe and life in general, such as\r\nthe _De causis et procreatione universi_, _De causis et proprietatibus\r\nelementorum et planetarum_, and the _De generatione et corruptione_.\r\nGeography is represented by the _De natura locorum_, zoology by the\r\ntwenty-six books on animals, botany by the seven books on vegetables\r\nand plants, and mineralogy by the five books on minerals. Björnbo\r\ncalled attention to a work on mirrors or catoptric ascribed to “Albert\r\nthe Preacher” in several manuscripts but which is not included in the\r\neditions of Albert’s works and which has never been printed.[1723] I\r\ndo not know if this is the same treatise as a treatise on Perspective\r\nattributed to Albertus Magnus in a manuscript which Björnbo did not\r\nmention.[1724] A work on the planting of trees and preserving of wine\r\nis sometimes ascribed to Albert in the manuscripts, but is probably\r\nrather by Petrus de Crescentiis or Galfridus de Vino Salvo.[1725]\r\nI think that I have encountered only once in the manuscripts the\r\nattribution to Albert of an epitome of the _Almagest_ of Ptolemy[1726]\r\nand of a _Summa astrologiae_.[1727] Fairly frequently one meets with\r\nsome brief compendium of all natural philosophy ascribed to Albert,\r\nof which perhaps the most common is the _Philosophia pauperum_ or\r\n“Introduction to the books of Aristotle on physics, sky and universe,\r\ngeneration and corruption, meteorology, and the soul.”[1728] These\r\nare either spurious, or, if based on Albert’s writings, add nothing\r\nof importance to them. Finally we may note a group of works lying on\r\nthe border of natural and occult science and which have been regarded\r\nas spurious: treatises on alchemy and chiromancy, the _Speculum\r\nastronomiae_, the _De secretis mulierum_, the _Liber aggregationis_,\r\nand the _De mirabilibus mundi_. Of some of these we shall treat in\r\nseparate chapters.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Can a gradual intellectual development be traced in Albert’s\r\nworks?]\r\n\r\nThe order in which Albert’s numerous works were written is a matter\r\ndifficult to determine but of some interest, although not of very great\r\nimportance, for our investigation. The statement of Peter of Prussia\r\nthat the translation of Aristotle “which we now use in the schools”\r\nwas made by Thomas of Cantimpré at the suggestion of Aquinas, “for in\r\nAlbert’s time all commonly used the old translation,”[1729] would, if\r\ntrue, suggest that Albert wrote his Aristotelian treatises early in\r\nlife, since he actually outlived Aquinas. But not much reliance is to\r\nbe placed in this statement of Peter, since it is reasonably certain\r\nthat Thomas of Cantimpré at least did not translate Aristotle. I have\r\nbeen impressed by differing and almost inconsistent attitudes in\r\ndifferent treatises by Albert, for instance in his attitude towards\r\nmagic, which seem to hint that his opinions changed with the years,\r\nalthough it may be attributable, as in some other authors, to the\r\nfact that in different works he reflects the attitude of different\r\nauthorities, or approaches different subjects with a different\r\nview-point, writing of theology as a theologian, but of Aristotle as a\r\nphilosopher. However, Baeumker and Schneider, pursuing in connection\r\nwith Albert’s writings a different line of investigation from mine,\r\nhave been struck with the same thing and have concluded that Albert\r\nunderwent a gradual intellectual development. They note that in his\r\n_Commentaries on the Sentences_ he is still glued to the Augustinian\r\ntradition, while in his _Summa_ he is strongly influenced by Aristotle\r\nand working for a synthesis of Aristotle and Augustine. Finally, in his\r\nphilosophical and scientific works, related to the genuine and spurious\r\nworks of Aristotle, “he goes very far with this Arabian-trimmed\r\nNeo-Platonism, often so far that he finally feels compelled to explain\r\nsuch exposition as mere citation, and in the strife of conflicting\r\nmasses of thought surging within him refers for his own personal\r\ninterpretation to his theological writings.”[1730] From this it\r\nwould seem that most of Albert’s theological treatises were written\r\nbefore his scientific works, based upon Aristotle and spurious Arabic\r\nand other additions. But we have seen that many of his Aristotelian\r\ntreatises were completed before the _Speculum naturale_ of Vincent\r\nof Beauvais, whereas his _Sentences_ name 1246 and 1249 as current\r\ndates.[1731]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: His best works are those on natural science.]\r\n\r\nBut while Albert may sometimes refer to his theological works for his\r\nown personal views, he does not do so in those passages which will\r\nespecially concern us, and it is in his works on natural science that\r\nhe seems to the modern reader more original. Indeed Jessen declared\r\nthat repeated perusal of Albert’s many writings in the field of natural\r\nhistory had convinced him that he was “original everywhere, even where\r\nhe seems to copy.”[1732] Jessen, indeed, held that Albert would have\r\nbeen even more original and outspoken than he is, but for fear of the\r\ncharge of heresy; but in my opinion there is little to support such a\r\nview. Be that as it may, in his works on natural science Albert does\r\nnot merely repeat past ideas whether of Aristotle or others, but adds\r\nchapters of his own drawn in large measure from his own observation,\r\nexperience, and classification. It is in his scientific works that he\r\nis as superior to Aquinas as the latter is generally considered to\r\nsurpass him in the purely metaphysical and theological field. Since\r\nwriting the foregoing sentences I have found that Peter of Prussia\r\nexpressed much the same view in his life of Albert written toward the\r\nclose of the fifteenth century. Peter says, “Moreover, this should be\r\nunderstood, that after Aristotle faith is to be put in Albert above all\r\nwho have written in philosophy, because he has himself illuminated the\r\nwritings of almost all philosophers and has seen wherein they spoke\r\ntruly or falsely, nay more, since he himself was experienced above all\r\nothers in natural phenomena. It may be that some, relying on their\r\nmetaphysics or logic, can impugn him by certain arguments, but I think\r\nthat no matter of great concern, since Albert himself says that faith\r\nis to be put in anyone who is expert in his art.”[1733]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Albert’s fame in the early nineteenth century.]\r\n\r\nAlbert’s scientific fame perhaps reached its zenith shortly before\r\nthe publication of Darwin’s _Origin of Species_ in 1859. In 1836 and\r\n1837 Ernst Meyer published in _Linnaea_[1734] his “Albertus Magnus,\r\nein Beitrag zur Geschichte der Botanik im XIII Jahrhundert,” and\r\nlater in his _History of Botany_[1735] ranked Albert as the greatest\r\nbotanist during the long period between Aristotle and Theophrastus on\r\nthe one hand and Andrea Cesalpini on the other. “Yes, more than that.\r\nFrom Aristotle, the creator of scientific botany, until his time this\r\nscience sank deeper and deeper with time. With him it arose like the\r\nPhoenix from its ashes. That, I think, is praise enough, and this crown\r\nshall no one snatch away from him.”[1736] In the meantime, at Paris in\r\n1853, Pouchet had published his _History of the Natural Sciences in\r\nthe Middle Ages_ with the sub-title, _Or Albertus Magnus and his age\r\nconsidered as the point of departure of the experimental school_.[1737]\r\nBut the extreme praise of Albert had occurred a little earlier in\r\nlectures on the history of science delivered by De Blainville at\r\nthe Sorbonne in 1839-1841 and published a few years later.[1738] De\r\nBlainville too centered his discussion of medieval science about\r\nAlbert, to whom alone he devoted some ninety pages, extolling him for\r\naffirming the permanence of species and for “broadening” Aristotle to\r\nfit the requirements of theology. In ten theses in which De Blainville\r\nundertook to sum up briefly the chief legacies of Albert to science, he\r\nheld that he completed and terminated the circle of human knowledge,\r\nadding to Aristotle the scientific demonstration of the relations\r\nof man with God; that he extended the scope of observation to every\r\nscientific field except anatomy; that he created the description of\r\nnatural bodies, a thing unknown to the ancients; and that in filling in\r\nthe gaps in Aristotle’s writings he was the first to embrace all the\r\nnatural sciences in a complete plan, logical and perfectly followed.\r\n“In accepting therefore with the Christian Aristotle,” concluded De\r\nBlainville, “the first verse of _Genesis_, ‘In the beginning God\r\ncreated heaven and earth,’ and the consequences which follow it, we\r\nhave, in my opinion, reached the _apogée_ of the encyclopedia of human\r\nknowledge, which can now only extend itself in respect to the number\r\nand the deeper knowledge of material objects.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A survival of the medieval attitude.]\r\n\r\nThis passage from De Blainville, who seems to have been a Roman\r\nCatholic, is very interesting as showing how the progress of modern\r\nscience in his own time and the centuries just preceding could be\r\nalmost completely miscomprehended by a professed historian of science.\r\nWe must not, however, suppose that such misconceptions of the progress\r\nof science were universal or even general in the first half of the\r\nnineteenth century. The article on Albertus Magnus in the _Histoire\r\nLittéraire de la France_, which was published in 1838, recognizes that\r\nAlbert did not extend the bounds of the sciences as much as had been\r\nsupposed, and that progress had been made since the sixteenth century\r\nwhich rendered that part of his works “almost useless.”[1739] The\r\npassage from De Blainville is interesting also as showing the same\r\nintimate connection presupposed between Christian theology, natural\r\nscience, and Aristotelianism as in the days of the great Dominicans\r\nthemselves. Again, it reveals the extent to which natural science,\r\nsince the appearance of _The Origin of Species_, has tended to the\r\nopposite extreme.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Recent historians of science and Albert.]\r\n\r\nAs for historians of science, they have been rather scarcer of late\r\nthan in the earlier years of the nineteenth century, when the subject\r\nseems to have had a great vogue in France. Or at least the historians\r\nof science have been less sympathetic with the distant past. Perhaps\r\nthe inclination has been to go almost as far toward the other pole\r\nof neglect as De Blainville went toward that of extollation. But\r\nthe modern eulogies of the scientific attainments of Roger Bacon,\r\nsupposed to be a thorn in the side of the medieval church and falsely\r\nregarded as its victim, and as the one lone scientific spirit of the\r\nmiddle ages, have been rather more absurd than the earlier praises of\r\nAlbert, who was represented both as a strong pillar in the church and\r\nthe backbone of medieval and Christian science. Indeed, the _Histoire\r\nLittéraire_, in the same passage which we a moment ago quoted against\r\nDe Blainville, also states with probable justification that Albert\r\ndid “more than any other doctor of his day” to introduce the natural\r\nsciences into the course of public and private studies, and that it\r\nwas his taste for those subjects which won him his popular renown and\r\nthe homage of scholars until the end of the seventeenth century. At no\r\nperiod, however, has Albert been entirely without defenders. Jessen in\r\n1867 regarded him as an original natural scientist. Stadler in 1906\r\nrecognized that “he made many independent observations, perhaps even\r\ncarried out experiments,” and showed great interest in biology.[1740]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Albert’s scientific spirit.]\r\n\r\nComing back from the opinions of others concerning Albert to his own\r\nattitude towards natural science, it is to be noted that, while he\r\nmay make all sorts of mistakes judged by modern standards, he does\r\nshow unmistakable signs of the scientific spirit. This will become\r\nmore apparent as we proceed, but for the present we may cite two\r\nexamples of it, and these from a work based upon a pseudo-Aristotelian\r\ntreatise and one which at first sight might seem quite superstitious\r\nand unscientific to the modern reader, since it is full of astrology,\r\nthe _De causis et proprietatibus elementorum et planetarum_.[1741] In\r\nthe first passage Albert repeats the justification of natural science\r\nagainst a narrow religious attitude which we heard from the lips of\r\nWilliam of Conches in the previous century. When Albert finds that\r\nsome men attribute the deluge simply to the divine will and believe\r\nthat no other cause for it should be sought, he replies that he too\r\nascribes it ultimately to the divine will, but that he believes that\r\nGod acts through natural causes in the case of natural phenomena, and\r\nthat, while he would not presume to search the causes of the divine\r\nwill, he does feel free to investigate those natural causes which were\r\nthe divine instruments. A little further on in the same chapter Albert\r\ndeclares that “it is not enough to know in terms of universals, but we\r\nseek to know each object’s own peculiar characteristics, for this is\r\nthe best and perfect kind of science.”[1742]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Philosophical generalization and scientific detail.]\r\n\r\nThis desire for concrete, specific, detailed, accurate knowledge\r\nconcerning everything in nature is felt by Albert in other of his\r\nwritings to be scarcely in the spirit of the Aristotelian natural\r\nphilosophy which he follows and sets forth in his parallel treatises.\r\nIn his work on animals a cleavage may be observed between those parts\r\nwhere Albert discusses the general natures and common characteristics\r\nof animals and seems to follow Aristotle rather closely, and those\r\nbooks where he lists and describes particular animals with numerous\r\nallusions to recent experience and considerable criticism of past\r\nauthorities. At the beginning of his twenty-second book he apologizes\r\nfor listing particular animals in alphabetical order, which is “not\r\nappropriate to philosophy,” by saying that “we know we are debtors both\r\nto the wise and to the unlearned, and those things which are told in\r\nparticular terms better instruct a rustic intelligence.” But while this\r\ndesire to describe particular objects precisely is felt by Albert to\r\nbe not in accord with traditional philosophic methods of presentation,\r\nit is a desire which many of his contemporaries share with him. At\r\nthe beginning of his sixth book on vegetables and plants, where\r\nparticular herbs and trees are listed, he explains, “In this sixth book\r\nof vegetables we satisfy the curiosity of our students rather than\r\nphilosophy, for philosophy cannot deal with particulars.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Medieval interest in nature.]\r\n\r\nThis healthy interest in nature and commendable curiosity concerning\r\nreal things was not confined to Albert’s students nor to “rustic\r\nintelligences.” One has only to examine the sculpture of the great\r\nthirteenth century cathedrals to see that the craftsmen of the towns\r\nwere close observers of the world of nature and that every artist was\r\na naturalist too. In the foliage that twines about the capitals of\r\nthe columns in French Gothic cathedrals it is easy to recognize, says\r\nM. Mâle, a large number of plants: “the plantain, arum, ranunculus,\r\nfern, clover, coladine, hepatica, columbine, cress, parsley,\r\nstrawberry-plant, ivy, snapdragon, the flower of the broom and the\r\nleaf of the oak, a typically French collection of flowers loved from\r\nchildhood.”[1743] _Mutatis mutandis_, the same statement could be made\r\nconcerning the carved vegetation that runs riot in Lincoln cathedral.\r\n“The thirteenth century sculptors sang their _chant de mai_. All the\r\nspring delights of the Middle Ages live again in their work--the\r\nexhilaration of Palm Sunday, the garlands of flowers, the bouquets\r\nfastened on the doors, the strewing of fresh herbs in the chapels, the\r\nmagical flowers of the feast of Saint John--all the fleeting charm of\r\nthose old-time springs and summers. The Middle Ages, so often said to\r\nhave little love for nature, in point of fact gazed at every blade of\r\ngrass with reverence.”[1744] But it is not merely love of nature but\r\nscientific interest and accuracy that we see revealed in the sculptures\r\nof the cathedrals and in the note-book of the thirteenth century\r\narchitect, Villard de Honnecourt,[1745] with its sketches of insect\r\nas well as animal life, of a lobster, two parroquets on a perch, the\r\nspirals of a snail’s shell, a fly, a dragonfly, and a grasshopper, as\r\nwell as a bear and a lion from life, and more familiar animals such\r\nas the cat and swan. The sculptors of gargoyles and chimeras were not\r\ncontent to reproduce existing animals but showed their command of\r\nanimal anatomy by creating strange compound and hybrid monsters--one\r\nmight almost say, evolving new species--which nevertheless have all\r\nthe verisimilitude of copies from living forms. It was these breeders\r\nin stone, these Burbanks of the pencil, these Darwins with the chisel,\r\nwho knew nature and had studied botany and zoology in a way superior to\r\nthe scholar who simply pored over the works of Aristotle and Pliny. No\r\nwonder that Albert’s students were curious about particular things.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Albert’s own attitude.]\r\n\r\nBut one is inclined to wonder whether the passage from the _De causis\r\net proprietatibus elementorum et planetarum_, which we quoted first,\r\nmay not have been written after the passages which we have quoted from\r\nhis works on plants and animals, and whether Albert had come, thanks\r\npossibly to that same stimulating scientific curiosity of his students,\r\nto cease to apologize for the detailed description of particular\r\nobjects as unphilosophical and to praise it as “the best and perfect\r\nkind of science.” At any rate it is those portions of his works on\r\nanimals, plants, and minerals which he devotes to such description of\r\nparticular objects which possess most independent value, and it is\r\nperhaps also worth noting that Ptolemy of Lucca in looking back upon\r\nAlbert’s work seems not only to distinguish his writings on logic\r\nand theology from those on nature, but also to imply a distinction\r\nbetween Aristotle’s natural philosophy and his “very well-known and\r\nmost excellent contribution to the experimental knowledge of things of\r\nnature.”[1746] Ptolemy seems to say Aristotle’s contribution, but the\r\ncredit really belongs largely to Albert and his students.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Albert and modern experimentation.]\r\n\r\nPouchet was therefore not without justification in his sub-title, “Or\r\nAlbertus Magnus and his Period Considered as the Beginning of the\r\nExperimental School.” His distinguishing, however, three stages of\r\nscientific progress in the history of civilization--the first, Greek,\r\ncharacterized by observation, and represented especially by Aristotle;\r\nthe second, Roman, marked by erudition and typified by Pliny; the\r\nthird, medieval, distinguished by experimentation, and having Albertus\r\nMagnus and Roger Bacon as its two great representatives;--was rather\r\ntoo general and sweeping. Galen, for instance, was a great experimenter\r\nand the ancient Empirics put little trust in anything except\r\nexperience. Albert himself, in discussing “the serious problem” whether\r\nlife is possible in the Antipodes or southern hemisphere, states that\r\n“the most powerful kings and the most accomplished philosophers have\r\nlabored over it from antiquity, the kings forsooth by experiment and\r\nthe philosophers by rational inquiry.”[1747] Moreover, neither Roger\r\nBacon nor Albert can be shown to have done much experimenting of the\r\nsort, carefully planned and regulated, which is carried on in modern\r\nlaboratories. Meyer in his _History of Botany_,[1748] although Albert\r\nwas a great favorite with him, felt constrained to renounce the credit\r\nfor purposive experimentation which Pouchet had given him. “How gladly\r\nwould I see this crown also placed deservedly upon my favorite’s\r\nhead!... But I do not know of his undertaking an experiment in order\r\nto solve a physiological or physical problem in which he had a clearly\r\ndefined purpose and the suitable materials at hand for carrying it out;\r\nhis books on plants certainly do not contain a single one.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Personal observation and experience of plants.]\r\n\r\nAlbert’s work on plants does contain, however, many passages in\r\nwhich he recognizes experience as a criterion of truth or gives the\r\nresults of his personal observations. Such passages occur especially\r\nin the sixth book where he tries to satisfy his students’ curiosity,\r\nbut we may first note an earlier passage where he recommends “making\r\nconjectures and experiments” in order to learn the nature of trees\r\nin general and of each variety of tree, herb, fruit, and fungus in\r\nparticular. Since, however, one can scarcely have personal experience\r\nof them all, it is also advisable to read the books which the experts\r\n(_experti_) of antiquity have written on such matters.[1749] But\r\na mistrust of the assertions of others often accompanies Albert’s\r\nreliance upon personal observation and experience. Like Galen in his\r\nwork on medicinal simples, he explains in opening his sixth book that\r\nmerely to list the names of plants found in existing books would\r\nfill a volume, and that he will limit his discussion to those native\r\nvarieties “better known among us.” Of some of these he has had personal\r\nexperience; for the others he follows authors whom he has found unready\r\nto state anything unless it was proved by experience. For experience\r\nalone is reliable concerning particular natures. He cautions in regard\r\nto a tree which is said to save doves from serpents, “But this has\r\nnot been sufficiently proved by certain experience, like the other\r\nfacts which are written here, but is found in the writings of the\r\nancients.”[1750] Of another assertion he remarks, “But this is proved\r\nby no experience”;[1751] and of a third he says, “As some affirm, but\r\nI have not tested this myself.”[1752]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Experience a criterion in zoology.]\r\n\r\nPersonal observation and experience are equally, if not more,\r\nnoticeable in Albert’s work on animals. He proposes to tell “what\r\nhe knows by reason and what he sees by experience of the natures of\r\nanimals”; he adds that science cannot be attained in all matters by\r\ndemonstration, in some cases one must resort to conjecture.[1753]\r\nAfter listing various remedies for the infirmities of falcons from the\r\nwork on falconry of the Emperor Frederick, he concludes, “Such are the\r\nmedicines which one finds given for falcons and the experience of wise\r\nmen, but the wise falconer will with time add to or subtract from them\r\naccording to his own experience of what is beneficial to the state of\r\nhealth of the birds. For experience is the best teacher in all matters\r\nof this sort.”[1754]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Observations of Albert and his associates.]\r\n\r\nIn the treatise on animals as in that on plants Albert’s allusions\r\nto experience occur mainly in the last few books where he describes\r\nparticular animals. Here he often says, “I have tested this,” or “I\r\nand my associates have experienced,”[1755] or “I have not experienced\r\nthis,” or “I have proved that this is not true.”[1756] Like Alexander\r\nof Neckam he rejects the story that the beaver castrates itself\r\nin order to escape with its life from its hunters; Albert says\r\nthat experience near his home has often disproved this.[1757] In\r\ndiscussing whales he restricts himself entirely to the results of\r\nhis own observation, saying, “We pass over what the Ancients have\r\nwritten on this topic because their statements do not agree with\r\nexperience.”[1758] According to Pouchet[1759] Albert gives even more\r\ndetailed information concerning whales than do the Norse sagas, and\r\nalso includes animals of the north unknown to classical writers. He\r\noccasionally reveals his nationality by giving the German as well\r\nas the Latin names of animals, and he displays an acquaintance\r\nwith the fauna of surrounding countries such as Norway, Sweden,\r\nBohemia, and Carinthia.[1760] He asserts that there are no eels in\r\nthe Danube and its tributaries, but that they abound in the other\r\nrivers of Germany.[1761] He tells of observing the habits of eagles\r\nin Livonia,[1762] or supports the account in Solinus of a monstrous\r\nbeast with fore legs like human arms and hind legs like human legs by\r\nstating that he has seen both male and female of the species captured\r\nin the forests of Russia (_Sclaviae_).[1763] Of his wide travels and\r\nobservation of natural phenomena we shall meet other examples as we\r\nproceed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Experiments with animals.]\r\n\r\nAlbert has not only observed animal life widely, he has also performed\r\nexperiments with animals as he apparently did not do with plants. He\r\nand his associates, for instance, have proved by experiment that a\r\ncicada goes on singing in its breast for a long time after its head has\r\nbeen cut off.[1764] He also proved to his satisfaction that the turtle,\r\nalthough a marine animal, would not drink sea water, unless possibly\r\nfresh water which flowed into the sea, by experimenting with a turtle\r\nin a vessel of water.[1765] He has heard it said that the ostrich eats\r\nand digests iron, but the many ostriches to whom he has offered the\r\nmetal have consistently declined it, although they would devour with\r\navidity stones and bones cut into small bits.[1766] Crude experiments\r\nthese may be, but they are at least purposive.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Past authors questioned.]\r\n\r\nAlbert also often expresses doubt as to certain statements concerning\r\nanimals on the ground that they have not been tested by experience,\r\neven if he has had no opportunity to disprove them. And he draws a\r\nsharp distinction between authors who state what they themselves\r\nhave seen and tested and those who appear simply to repeat rumor or\r\nfolk-lore. That there are any such birds as gryphons or griffins,\r\nhe believes is affirmed in story-books (_historiae_) rather than\r\nsupported by the experiments of philosophers or arguments of\r\nphilosophy.[1767] The story found in the _Physiologus_ of the pelican’s\r\nrestoring its young with its own blood he also considers as “read in\r\nstory-books rather than proved philosophically by experience,”[1768]--a\r\ncriticism which shows how mistaken those modern scholars have been\r\nwho have declared the Physiologus and Bestiaries representative of\r\nthe thirteenth century attitude towards nature. The accounts of\r\nharpies which one reads are also according to Albert “not based upon\r\nexperience, but are the assertions of men of no great authority.”[1769]\r\nThey are said to be rapacious birds with crooked nails and human\r\nfaces, and when a harpy meets a man in the desert it is said to kill\r\nhim, but afterwards, when it sees by its reflection in the water that\r\nits own face is human, it grieves all the rest of its life for the\r\nman whom it has slain. “But these statements,” says Albert, “have not\r\nbeen experienced and seem fabulous. Such tales are told especially by\r\na certain Adelinus” (perhaps the Anglo-Saxon Aldhelm) “and Solinus\r\nand Jorach.” Albert is particularly chary of accepting the assertions\r\nof these last two authors, assuring us, anent their statement that\r\ncertain birds can fly unharmed through flames, “These philosophers\r\ntell many lies and I think that this is one of their lies.”[1770] In\r\nyet other passages Albert calls one or the other of them a liar.[1771]\r\nHe also sometimes rejects statements of Pliny, once classing him with\r\nSolinus among those who rehearse popular hearsay rather than disclose\r\nscientific experience.[1772]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Instances of credulity.]\r\n\r\nAlbert thus displays considerable independence in dealing with past\r\nauthorities. Yet at times statements in earlier writers which seem\r\nabsurd to us pass him unchallenged. He is far, for example, from\r\nrejecting all of Pliny’s marvelous assertions. He still believes that\r\nthe little fish _eschinus_ can stop “a ship two hundred feet or more”\r\nin length by clinging to its keel, so that neither wind nor art nor\r\nviolence can move it.[1773] And he adds something to Pliny’s tale of\r\nhunters who make good their escape to their ship with the tiger’s\r\ncubs by throwing them one at a time to the pursuing tigress, who\r\ntakes each whelp back to her lair before returning to the pursuit of\r\nthe hunters.[1774] Albert’s emendation is that the hunters provide\r\nthemselves with glass spheres which they roll one at a time towards\r\nthe pursuing tigress.[1775] Seeing her own reflection on a small\r\nscale in the glass ball, she thinks it one of her cubs until she\r\nhas vainly tried to give it milk, when she discovers the fraud and\r\nbounds after the hunters again. But a second and a third glass ball\r\ndeceive her temporarily as before, and so the hunters reach their ship\r\nwithout having had to surrender any of the real cubs. This imputation\r\nof singular stupidity to the tigress should be kept in mind to set\r\nagainst other passages in medieval writers where almost human sagacity\r\nis ascribed to animals. Although in two or three preceding passages\r\nAlbert has refuted the doctrine of spontaneous generation of animal\r\nlife,[1776] he attributes the following passage to Pliny without\r\nadverse criticism.[1777] “There is a worm shaped like a star, as Pliny\r\nsays, which shines like a star at night; but it never appears except\r\nwhen after great clouds it predicts clear weather.[1778] He says that\r\nthere is so much rigid cold in this worm that it extinguishes fire like\r\nice. And if a man’s flesh is touched with its slime, all the hair falls\r\noff and what it touches decays. And he says that they beget nothing,\r\nnor is there male or female among them. Therefore they are generated\r\nfrom decaying matter.” Albert also accepts the story of the poisoned\r\nmaiden sent to Alexander the Great.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Incredible “experiences.”]\r\n\r\nAlbert also is unduly credulous of utterances about animals supposed\r\nto be based upon experience, although he cannot be called a mere\r\nempiricist, since he tries to test particular statements by the general\r\nlaws concerning living beings which he has read in Aristotle or derived\r\nfrom his own experience and reflection. He denies, for example, Pliny’s\r\nstatement that other animals are attracted by the pleasant smell which\r\nthe panther emits as it sleeps after overeating, on the ground that man\r\nis the only animal who is pleased or displeased by odors.[1779] But it\r\nwould seem that some of the fishermen, fowlers, and hunters from whom\r\nhe gleaned bits of zoological information were not so trustworthy as he\r\nimagined. He says that “a trustworthy person” told him that he saw in\r\nan eagle’s nest three hundred ducks, over a hundred geese, about forty\r\nhares, and many large fish, all of which were required to satisfy the\r\nappetites of the young eagles.[1780] He also “heard from trustworthy\r\npersons” that a serpent with the virgin countenance of a beardless man\r\n“was slain in an island of Germany and there displayed in our times\r\nto all who wished to see it until the flesh putrefied.”[1781] Such\r\nreports of mermaids and sea-serpents have still, however, a certain\r\ncurrency. Experienced hunters said that worms could be killed in\r\nany beast by suspending from its neck a strip of citron (_sticados\r\ncitrinum_) immediately after it had been dried.[1782] German artificers\r\nof Albert’s day told him that the hyena bore a gem in its eyes, or\r\nmore truly in its forehead.[1783] Albert sometimes has a tall story\r\nof his own to tell. At Cologne in the presence of himself and many\r\nassociates a little girl of perhaps three years was exhibited who, as\r\nsoon as she was released from her mother’s hands, ran to the corners\r\nof the room searching for spiders, “and ate them all large and small,\r\nand flourished on this diet and greatly preferred it to all other\r\nfood.”[1784] Albert also learned by personal experience that moles\r\ngladly eat frogs and toads. For once he saw a mole who held by the foot\r\na big toad which “cried loudly because of the mole’s bite.”[1785] He\r\nalso found by experience that both frogs and toads would eat a dead\r\nmole. In affirming that the custom of killing off the old men is still\r\nprevalent within the borders of Saxony and Poland, Albert says, “As I\r\nhave seen with my own eyes”; but really all that he has seen is the\r\ngraves of their fathers which the sons have shown to him.[1786]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Minerals and experience.]\r\n\r\nAlbert’s general attitude towards past authorities and present\r\nexperience remains the same in his treatise on minerals. He will give\r\nthe names of the important gems and state their virtues as known from\r\nauthorities and experience, but he will not repeat everything that\r\nhas been said about precious stones because it is not profitable for\r\nscience. “For natural science is not simply receiving what one is\r\ntold, but the investigation of causes in natural phenomena.”[1787]\r\nConcerning metals, too, he intends to state “rationally either what\r\nhas been handed down by the philosophers or what I myself have\r\nexperienced.”[1788] He adds that once he wandered far in exile to\r\nplaces rich in mines in order that he might test the natures of metals.\r\n“And for this same reason I investigated the transmutation of metals\r\namong the alchemists, in order that I might observe something of the\r\nnature and characteristics of the metals.” In a later chapter he\r\nalludes to workers in copper “in our parts, namely, Paris and Cologne,\r\nand in other places where I have been and seen things tested by\r\nexperience.”[1789] _Fui et vidi experiri_, such is Albert the Great’s\r\npeaceful paraphrase, probably unintentional, for warring Caesar’s\r\n_Veni, vidi, vici_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Minerals and credulity.]\r\n\r\nAgain, also, in the treatise on minerals, reliance upon experience\r\nproves to be no sure guarantee against incorrect notions, credulity,\r\nand unquestioning trust in authority. Albert still repeats[1790] the\r\nold notion that “adamant,” hard as it is, is softened and dissolved by\r\nthe blood and flesh of a goat, especially if the goat for some time\r\nbefore has been fed on a diet of certain herbs and wine.[1791] He adds\r\nthat this property of goat’s blood makes it beneficial for sufferers\r\nfrom stone in the bladder. Albert repeats with a qualifying “It is\r\nsaid” the statement that the emerald comes from the nests of gryphons\r\nor griffins,[1792] but he does not stop to deny the existence of those\r\nbirds, as we have heard him do elsewhere. He adds, however, as to the\r\nsource of the emerald that “a truthful and curious experimenter coming\r\nfrom Greece” had said that it was produced in rocks under the sea.\r\nThis expression, “curious experimenter” (_curiosus experimentator_),\r\nor perhaps better “inquisitive observer,” Albert also applied to one\r\nof his associates who saw Frederick II’s peculiar magnet.[1793] In the\r\npresent discussion of the emerald he adds that experience in his own\r\ntime has proved that this stone, “if good and true,” cannot endure\r\nsexual intercourse, so that the reigning king of Hungary, who was\r\nwearing an emerald upon his finger when he went in to his wife, broke\r\nit into three pieces. “And that is probably why they say that this\r\nstone inclines its wearer to chastity.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Tale of a toad and an emerald.]\r\n\r\nAlbert, however, had told as a personal experience a stranger tale\r\nthan this of an emerald in his work on vegetables and plants in order\r\nto illustrate “the many effects of stones and plants which are known\r\nby experience and by which wonders are worked.” But as a matter of\r\nfact, the incident is concerned not with an emerald and a plant, but an\r\nemerald and a toad, an animal which one would infer was in Albert’s day\r\noften the subject of experiment.\r\n\r\n“An emerald was recently seen among us, small in size but marvelous in\r\nbeauty. When its virtue was to be tested, someone stepped forth and\r\nsaid that, if a circle was made about a toad with the emerald and then\r\nthe stone was set before the toad’s eyes, one of two things would\r\nhappen. Either the stone, if of weak virtue, would be broken by the\r\ngaze of the toad; or the toad would burst, if the stone was possessed\r\nof full natural vigor. Without delay things were arranged as he bade;\r\nand after a short lapse of time, during which the toad kept its eye\r\nunswervingly upon the gem, the latter began to crack like a nut and\r\na portion of it flew from the ring. Then the toad, which had stood\r\nimmovable hitherto, withdrew as if it had been freed from the influence\r\nof the gem.”[1794]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Experience versus Aristotle.]\r\n\r\nIn the incident just narrated Albert was perhaps tricked by some\r\ntraveling magician. But let us conclude our discussion of his general\r\nscientific method by some more rational instances of personal\r\nobservation and experience. In his treatise on meteorology his\r\ndiscussion of the rainbow, which occupies some twenty-four pages of\r\nBorgnet’s text,[1795] is especially based upon experience and full\r\nof allusions to it--a very interesting fact in view of the large\r\nspace which the discussion of the rainbow occupies in Roger Bacon’s\r\nbetter known eulogy of experimental science. Albert recounts his own\r\nobservations when sailing over great waves or when looking down from\r\nthe top of a castle built upon a high mountain, “and the time when this\r\nwas seen was in the morning after a rainy night, and it was in the\r\nautumn with the sun in the sign of Virgo.” Albert takes exception to\r\nAristotle’s assertion that rainbows caused by the moon at night appear\r\nonly twice in fifty years. He and many others have seen a bow at night,\r\nand “truthful experimenters have found by experience” (_veridici\r\nexperimentatores experti sunt_) that a rainbow has appeared twice at\r\nnight in the same year. Nor can Albert conceive of any astronomical\r\nreason why it should appear only twice in fifty years. “And so I think\r\nthat Aristotle stated this from the opinions of others and not from\r\nthe truth of demonstration or experience, while those facts which\r\nhave been adduced against his statement have been experienced beyond\r\na doubt by myself and by other reliable investigators associated with\r\nme.” The very chapter headings of this portion of Albert’s treatise\r\nsuggest an antithesis between the ancient authorities and recent\r\nexperimental investigation, for instance: “Of the Iris of the Moon\r\nand what Ancients have said of it and what Moderns have tested by\r\nexperience,”[1796] and “A Digression stating Seneca’s views concerning\r\n_virgae_ and experiments with certain arcs seen in modern times.”[1797]\r\nThus while Albert of course believes that the statements of many of\r\nhis authorities are based upon experience, he seems to feel that he\r\nand his associates have founded an important modern school for the\r\ninvestigation of nature at first hand. We may choose to regard it as a\r\nmere school of observation, but he dignifies its members by the title\r\nof _experimentatores_. Again therefore we may admit that Pouchet was\r\nnot unjustified in associating Albert with the modern experimental\r\nschool.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. _His Allusions to Magic_\r\n\r\nAt the close of his story of the toad and the emerald Albert adds\r\nthat there are many other such virtues of stones and plants which are\r\nlearned by experience, and that magicians investigate the same and\r\nwork wonders by them. It is therefore quite appropriate for us to turn\r\ndirectly from his attitude to experimental method to his conception\r\nof magic. Like William of Auvergne he hints at an association between\r\nthe two. His pupil and contemporary, Ulrich Engelbert of Strasburg,\r\nactually called him “expert in magic.”[1798]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Peter of Prussia on Albert’s occult science.]\r\n\r\nIn his _Life of Albert_ Peter of Prussia not only is evidently\r\nconcerned to make him out a saint as well as a scientist, telling of\r\nhis devotion to the Eucharist[1799] and the Virgin Mary and the wood\r\nof the Holy Cross[1800] and of the miraculous visions which he had\r\nfrom childhood, in which the Virgin and the Apostle Paul appeared\r\nto him,[1801] and how he advanced more in knowledge by prayer than\r\nby study and labor,[1802] and that he read the Psalter through\r\ndaily.[1803] He also devotes a number of chapters[1804] to a defense of\r\nAlbert against the charge of having indulged in occult sciences, and\r\nof having been “too curious concerning natural phenomena.”[1805] Peter\r\nexplains that many superstitions were rife in Albert’s time and that\r\nnigromancers were fascinating the people by their false miracles, and\r\npretending that their sorcery was worked by the sciences of astronomy,\r\nmathematics, and alchemy.[1806] It was therefore essential that some\r\nman who was equally learned and devout should thoroughly examine\r\nthese sciences, proving what was good in them and rejecting what was\r\nbad.[1807] Peter is inclined to be disingenuous in stating Albert’s\r\nattitude toward some of the occult sciences, especially the engraving\r\nof stones with images according to the aspects of the stars, which he\r\nmisrepresents Albert as prohibiting, whereas Albert really calls it a\r\ngood doctrine, as we shall show later. Peter however states “how useful\r\nit is to know natural and occult phenomena in the nature of things, and\r\nthat those who write about such things are to be praised for it.”[1808]\r\nAlso “that it is useful and necessary to know the facts of nature even\r\nif they are indecent.”[1809] Later on, towards the close of his book,\r\nPeter denies various feats of magic that by his time had come to be\r\npopularly recounted of Albert, and then does his best to make up for\r\nthe subtracted marvels by himself inventing many pious miracles in\r\nwhich he would have us believe Albert was concerned.[1810]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Trithemius on Albert’s study of magic.]\r\n\r\nThe learned Trithemius (1462-1516), abbot of Sponheim, in a letter\r\nto John Westenburgh in which he defends himself against the charge\r\nof magic, admits that he “cannot say that he is entirely ignorant of\r\nnatural magic,” a form of wisdom which he regards very highly; and\r\nadduces in his justification the example of “Albertus Magnus, that\r\nmost learned man and among the saints truly most saintly, of the\r\nprofoundest intellect, worthy of eternal memory, who scrutinized the\r\ndepths of natural philosophy, and learned to know marvels unheard of by\r\nothers.”[1811] Even to this day, continues Trithemius, he is unjustly\r\nregarded by the unlearned as a magician and devotee of superstition.\r\nFor he was not ignorant of the magic of nature, and he had innocently\r\nread and mastered a great number of superstitious books by depraved\r\nmen. For not the knowledge but the practice of evil is evil. Trithemius\r\nadmits that he himself has read many books of superstitious and even\r\ndiabolical magic, but contends that this is necessary, if one is to\r\nlearn to distinguish natural from illicit magic.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Magnus in magia._]\r\n\r\nThe brief but sane estimate of Albertus Magnus published eighty years\r\nago in the _Histoire Littéraire de la France_, from which we have\r\nalready had occasion to quote regarding his importance in the history\r\nof natural science, mentions the efforts of Trithemius and Naudé to\r\ndefend him from the charge of magic, but adds that even his panegyrists\r\nhave called him “great in magic, greater in philosophy, greatest in\r\ntheology,” and agrees that he frequently shows a leaning towards the\r\noccult sciences. “He is an alchemist, he is an astrologer, he believes\r\nin enchantments; he delights like most savants of his age in explaining\r\nall phenomena that surprise him by supernatural causes.” This rough\r\ncharacterization contains much truth, although it is hardly true that\r\nAlbert gave supernatural explanations for strange natural phenomena.\r\nRather he believed in occult forces and marvels in nature which we no\r\nlonger credit. We also have already stated it as our opinion that he\r\nwas really much greater as a natural scientist than as a theologian.\r\nBut we have now to examine what grounds there are for calling him\r\n_magnus in magia_, and _in magicis expertus_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: His varying treatment of magic.]\r\n\r\nMagic is often mentioned by Albert, both in his Biblical and\r\nAristotelian commentaries, both in his theological writings and his\r\nworks on natural science. Some references to magic arts, occurring\r\nchiefly in the Biblical commentaries, are too brief, incidental, and\r\nperfunctory to afford any particular information.[1812] The other\r\npassages seem scarcely consistent with one another and will require\r\nseparate treatment. We shall first consider those in which Albert more\r\nor less adheres to the traditional Christian attitude of condemnation\r\nof magic as criminal and dealing with demons, of recognition of its\r\nmarvels but jealous differentiation of them from divine miracle. It\r\nshould be observed that all such passages occur in his theological\r\nwritings and that in them he does little more than rehearse opinions\r\nwhich we have already encountered in the writings of the early\r\nChristian fathers with a few additional citations from books of\r\nnecromancy or from Arabic works on natural science such as those of\r\nAlgazel and Avicenna.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Reality of magic.]\r\n\r\nAlbert has no doubt either in his scientific or religious writings that\r\nmarvels can be worked by magic. It is true that one of its departments,\r\n_praestigia_, has to do with illusions and juggleries in which things\r\nare made to appear to exist which have no reality. But it also performs\r\nactual transformations.[1813] But even the actual performances of magic\r\nare deceptive in that demons by their means lead human souls astray,\r\nwhich is far worse than merely to deceive the eye.[1814]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Magic due to demons.]\r\n\r\nAlbert affirms in his theological _Summa_ that it is the consensus of\r\nopinion that magic is due to demons. “For the saints expressly say\r\nso, and it is the common opinion of all persons, and it is taught in\r\nthat part of necromancy which deals with images and rings and mirrors\r\nof Venus and seals of demons by Achot Graecus and Grema of Babylon\r\nand Hermes of Egypt, and invocations for this purpose are described\r\nin the book of Hermogenes and Philetus, the necromancers, and in\r\nthe book called the Almandel of Solomon.”[1815] In his _Commentary\r\non the Sentences_[1816] Albert declares that to make use of “magic\r\nvirtues” is evil and apostasy from the Faith, whether one openly\r\nresorts to “invocations, conjurations, sacrifices, suffumigations, and\r\nadorations,” or to some simple operation which none the less requires\r\ndemon aid for its performance. One must beware even of “mathematical\r\nvirtues,” that is, of astrological forces, especially in “images,\r\nrings, mirrors, and characters,” lest the practice of idolatry be\r\nintroduced. In commenting upon the passage in the gospel where the\r\nPharisees accuse Christ of casting out demons through the prince of\r\ndemons, Albert admits that necromancers are able to cast out demons and\r\nto restrain them from doing external damage, but holds that they cannot\r\nlike Christ restrain the evil spirits from inciting inward sin.[1817]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Magic and miracle.]\r\n\r\nAlbert will not admit, however, that the marvels of magic compare with\r\ndivine miracles. For one thing, feats of magic do not even happen as\r\ninstantaneously as miracles, although they occur much more rapidly\r\nthan the ordinary processes of nature. But except for this difference\r\nin speed the works of magic can usually be explained as the product\r\nof natural forces, and by the fact that the demons are aided in their\r\noperations by the influence of the stars. To change rods into snakes,\r\nfor instance, as Pharaoh’s magicians did, is simply hastening the\r\nprocess by which worms generate in decaying trees. Indeed, Albert is\r\ninclined to believe that the demons “produce no permanent substantial\r\nform that would not easily be produced by putrefaction.”[1818] The\r\nmagic power of fascination is after all only analogous to the virtue of\r\nthe sapphire in curing ulcers or of the emerald in restraining sexual\r\npassion. Albert adds the comforting thought that neither fascination\r\nnor the magic art can harm anyone who has firm faith in God, but for\r\nus the most important thing to note is that even in his theological\r\nwritings he has associated magic with natural forces and the stars as\r\nwell as with demons. In this he resembles William of Auvergne rather\r\nthan the early Christian fathers.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Good magic of the Magi.]\r\n\r\nLike some other Christian commentators, Albert exempts the Magi of the\r\ngospel story, who followed the star to Bethlehem, from the category of\r\nmagicians in the evil sense that we have just heard him define magic.\r\nIn his commentary upon the gospel by Matthew he asserts that “the Magi\r\nare not sorcerers (_malefici_) as some wrongly think.” He also affirms\r\nthat there is a difference between a Magus and a _mathematicus_ or an\r\nenchanter or necromancer or _ariolus_ or _aruspex_ or diviner. Like\r\nIsidore Albert adopts the incorrect etymology of connecting Magus and\r\n_magnus_. But for him the Magi are not so called on account of the\r\nmagnitude of their sins. “Etymologically the Magi are great men” whose\r\nknowledge of, or conjecture from, the inevitable processes of cause\r\nand effect in nature often enables them to predict or produce marvels\r\nof nature. In his commentary on the Book of Daniel Albert quotes\r\nJerome’s similar description of them as “masters who philosophize\r\nabout the universe; moreover, the Magi are more particularly called\r\nastronomers who search the future in the stars.” It is interesting to\r\nnote that this view of the Magi still persists among Roman Catholics;\r\nthe recent Catholic Encyclopedia still insists concerning the wise\r\nmen who came to Bethlehem, “Neither were they magicians: the good\r\nmeaning of μάγοι, though found nowhere else in the Bible, is demanded\r\nby the context of the second chapter of Matthew.” But here is a still\r\nmore interesting point to note: Albertus Magnus does not deny that\r\nthe Magi were magicians. To contend that Magi were not _magi_ was a\r\ncontradiction of terms that was probably too much for his common sense.\r\nAll that he tries to do is to exculpate them from the practice of\r\nthose particular evil, superstitious, and diabolical occult arts which\r\nIsidore and others had included in their definitions of magic. From\r\nevil witchcraft and necromancy and fatalistic astrology, from augury\r\nand liver divination, from the arts of _sortilegi_ and _pythones_,\r\nof enchanters “who by means of certain incantations perform certain\r\nfeats with beasts or herbs or stones or images,” or of diviners who\r\nemploy geomancy or “the chance of fire” or hydromancy or aerimancy:\r\nfrom all such practices he acquits them. “They were not devoted to any\r\nof these arts, but only to magic as it has been described. And this\r\nis praiseworthy.”[1819] Thus Albert not merely defends the Magi, he\r\npraises magic; and we begin to see the fitness of the epithet, _Magnus\r\nin magia_, as applied to him.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Natural magic.]\r\n\r\nBut how does this praiseworthy magic differ from the magic which he\r\ncondemned in his _Summa_ and commentary on the Sentences? Presumably\r\nin that its objects are good not evil, and that it does not make any\r\nuse of demons. It would seem to resemble closely the natural magic of\r\nWilliam of Auvergne. It is like evil magic in that both employ the\r\nforces of nature and the influences of the stars, but it is unlike\r\nit in that it employs them exclusively and is free from any resort\r\nto demons and also apparently from the use of incantations or the\r\nsuperstitious devices of geomancers and other diviners.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Attitude in the scientific treatises.]\r\n\r\nIf in his theological writings Albert thus distinguishes two varieties\r\nof magic, one good and one evil, one demoniacal and one natural,\r\nwe need not be surprised if in his scientific treatises, where he\r\nis influenced mainly by Arabian astrology, the pseudo-Aristotelian\r\ntreatises, the Hermetic literature, and other such writings rather than\r\nby patristic literature, he introduces yet a third conception of magic,\r\nwhich scarcely agrees with either of the others and yet has features\r\nin common with both. He nowhere in his commentaries on Aristotle or\r\nother works of natural science really stops and discusses magic at any\r\nlength. But there are a number of brief and incidental allusions to\r\nit which imply that it is a distinct and definite branch of knowledge\r\nof which, although he himself does not treat, he gives no sign of\r\ndisapproval. He also cites even enchanters and necromancers without\r\noffering any apology, and now seems to regard as sub-divisions of magic\r\nthose occult arts from which we have just heard him exculpate the Magi.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Use of animals and herbs in magic.]\r\n\r\nIn his treatise on animals Albert states that anointing a sleeper’s\r\ntemples with the blood of a hoopoe makes him see terrible dreams,\r\nand that enchanters value highly the brain, tongue, and heart of\r\nthis bird. He adds, “But we shall not discuss this matter here, for\r\nthe investigation of it belongs to another science,”--presumably to\r\nmagic.[1820] In his treatise on plants he says that certain herbs seem\r\nto have “divine effects”[1821] which those who study magic follow\r\nup further. Examples are the betony, said to confer the power of\r\ndivination, the verbena, used as a love charm, and the herb _meropis_,\r\nsupposed to open closed seas, and many other such plants listed in the\r\nbooks of incantations of Hermes the philosopher and of Costa ben Luca\r\nthe philosopher and in the books of physical ligatures. “Enchanter”\r\n(_Incantator_), apparently the author or title of a book, is cited\r\nmore than once for the virtues of herbs, and what enchanters in general\r\nsay is also mentioned.[1822] “According to the testimony of the\r\n_praestigia_ of the magi” the juice of a certain herb drunk in water\r\nmakes a person do or say whatever the magician says or does.[1823]\r\nStudents of magic believe that the seed of another herb extinguishes\r\nlust.[1824] Necromancers avow that betony indicates the future when\r\nplucked with an adjuration of Aesculapius,[1825] and students of\r\nnecromancy say that a man invoking demons should have a character\r\npainted on him with the herb Jusquiam,[1826] and that gods invoked by\r\ncharacters and seals and sacrifices present themselves more readily\r\nif frankincense is offered them.[1827] Such passages seem to indicate\r\nthat Albert regarded occult virtues as largely the concern of magic,\r\nbut that at least in necromancy the invocation of gods and demons also\r\nenters.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Magic stones.]\r\n\r\nMany allusions to magic occur in Albert’s treatise on minerals, as the\r\nespecially marvelous powers attributed to gems in antiquity might well\r\nlead us to expect. The magi, he tells us, make much use of the stone\r\n_diacodos_, which is said to excite phantasms but loses its virtue if\r\nit touches a corpse.[1828] But such things do not come within Albert’s\r\npresent scope; he refers the reader for further information to the\r\nbooks of magic of Hermes, Ptolemy, and Thebith ben Chorath. The stone\r\nmagnet is also stated in the magic books to have a marvelous power of\r\nproducing phantasms, especially if consecrated with an adjuration and a\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Magic images engraved on gems.]\r\n\r\nAlbert twice assures us that the “prodigious and marvelous” powers of\r\nstones, and more particularly of images and seals engraved on stones,\r\ncannot be really understood without a knowledge of the three other\r\nsciences of magic, necromancy, and astrology.[1829] He therefore\r\nwill not in this treatise on minerals discuss the subject as fully\r\nas he might, “since those powers cannot be proved by physical laws\r\n(_principiis physicis_), but require a knowledge of astronomy and magic\r\nand the necromantic sciences, which should be considered in other\r\ntreatises.”[1830] For the reason why gems were first so engraved he\r\nrefers his readers to “the science of the _magi_ which Magor Graecus\r\nand Germa of Babylon and Hermes the Egyptian were among the first\r\nto perfect, and in which later wise Ptolemy was a marvelous light\r\nand Geber of Spain; Tebith, too, handed down a full treatment of the\r\nart.”[1831] And in this science it is a fundamental principle that all\r\nthings produced by nature or art are influenced by celestial virtues.\r\nThus we comprehend the close connection of astrology and magic. As\r\nfor necromancy, the third “science” involved, Albert’s associates are\r\ncurious to know the doctrine of images even if it is necromancy, and\r\nAlbert does not hesitate to assure them that it is a good doctrine\r\nin any case. Yet in his theological writings he not only condemned\r\nnecromancy, but declared the art of images to be evil “because it\r\ninclines to idolatry by imputing divinity to the stars, and ... is\r\nemployed for idle or evil ends.”[1832]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Magic and alchemy; finding hidden metals.]\r\n\r\nAlbert again refers to magic in his discussion of alchemy in the\r\ntreatise on minerals, where he not only cites Hermes a great deal but\r\nrefers to writings by Avicenna on magic and alchemy.[1833] Albert\r\nholds that it is not the business of a physical or natural scientist\r\n(_physicus_) to determine concerning the transmutation of metals; that\r\nis the affair of the art of alchemy, which thus seems to lie outside\r\nthe field of natural science upon the borders of magic. Similarly the\r\nproblem in what places and mountains and by what signs metals are\r\ndiscovered falls partly within the sphere of natural science and partly\r\nbelongs to that magical science which has to do with finding hidden\r\ntreasure. Albert perhaps has the employment of the divining rod in mind.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fascination and magic.]\r\n\r\nThe occult virtue of the human mind is another matter which Albert\r\nseems inclined to place within the field of magic. In the treatise on\r\nminerals[1834] he remarks that whether fascination is true or not is a\r\nquestion for magic to settle, and in his _On Sleep and Waking_[1835]\r\nhe cites Avicenna and Algazel as adducing “fascination and magic\r\nvirtues” as examples of occult influence exerted by one man over\r\nanother. It will be remembered that he cited the same authors anent\r\nfascination in his Commentary on the Sentences,[1836] but there denied\r\nthat fascination or magic could harm anyone who had firm faith in God,\r\nalthough he illustrated the possibility of potent human occult virtue\r\nexercised at will by the marvelous virtues exerted constantly by the\r\nsapphire and emerald. Peter of Prussia gives us to understand that\r\nAlbert’s belief was that fascination did not operate naturally but\r\nby the aid of demons; nevertheless certain men are generated at rare\r\nintervals who work marvels like the twins in Germany in Albert’s time\r\nat whose approach bolts would open.[1837]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Interpretation of dreams and magic.]\r\n\r\nAlbert also regards the interpretation of dreams as especially the\r\naffair of magic. In one passage of _On Sleep and Waking_[1838] he\r\ngrants that probably the art of interpreting dreams cannot be acquired\r\nwithout a knowledge of magic and “astronomy.” In a second passage[1839]\r\nhe speaks of the magicians as teaching the interpretation of dreams\r\nand the “astronomers” as talking of signs of prophecies, but not the\r\nsort of prophecy accepted among theologians. In a third passage[1840]\r\nhe defines the kind of dreams “which wise men interpret and for which\r\nwas invented the art of interpretation in the magical sciences.” Albert\r\nseems to have no particular objection, either moral or religious,\r\nto the interpretation of dreams, even if it is a branch of magic.\r\nRather he censures Aristotle and other philosophers for not having\r\ninvestigated this side of the subject further, and he thinks that\r\nby physical science alone one can at least determine what sort of\r\ndreams are of value for purposes of divination and are susceptible\r\nto interpretation.[1841] Magicians make great use not only of dreams\r\nbut also of visions seen when one is awake but with the senses\r\ndistracted.[1842] The magicians indeed specialize in potions which clog\r\nand stupefy the senses, and thereby produce apparitions by means of\r\nwhich they predict the future.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Magic and divination.]\r\n\r\nIn this same treatise _On Sleep and Waking_ Albert lists together\r\n“the astronomer and augur and magician and interpreter of dreams and\r\nvisions and every such diviner.”[1843] He admits that almost all men\r\nof this type delight in deception and are poorly educated and confuse\r\nwhat is contingent with what is necessary, but he insists that “the\r\ndefect is not in the science but in those who abuse it.” Thus magic and\r\ndivination in general are closely associated.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Summary of Albert’s accounts of magic.]\r\n\r\nThis last passage, like the connecting of enchanters and necromancers\r\nwith magic which we have noted in a previous paragraph, is hard to\r\nreconcile with the passage in his commentary upon the Gospel of Matthew\r\nwhere Albert separated the Magi and magic from diviners, enchanters,\r\nnecromancers, and their arts. So far as mere classification is\r\nconcerned, Albert’s references to magic in his scientific writings\r\nare in closer accord with his discussion of magic in the _Summa_ and\r\nSentences, where too he associated magic with the stars, with occult\r\nvirtues, with fascination, and with images. But the emphasis which he\r\nthere laid upon the evil character of magic and its connection with\r\ndemons is now almost entirely lacking. Our attention is rather being\r\ncontinually called to how closely magic, or at least some parts of it,\r\nborder upon natural science and astronomy. And yet we are also always\r\nbeing reminded that magic, although itself a “science,” is essentially\r\ndifferent in methods and results from natural science or at least from\r\nwhat Albert calls “physical science.” Overlapping both these fields,\r\napparently, and yet rather distinct from both in Albert’s thought,\r\nis the great subject of “astronomy” which includes both the genuine\r\nnatural science and the various vagaries of astrology. It is all like\r\nsome map of a feudal area where certain fiefs owe varying degrees of\r\nfealty to, or are claimed by, several lords and where the frontiers are\r\nloose, fluctuating, and uncertain. Perhaps the rule of the stars can be\r\nmade to account for almost everything in natural science or in magic,\r\nbut Albert seems inclined to leave room for the independent action of\r\ndivine power, the demons, and the human mind and will. But his attitude\r\nto the stars and to astrology will be considered more fully later; we\r\nshall first examine in more detail his own attitude towards marvelous\r\nvirtues in inferior nature and towards some of the other matters which\r\nhe has located expressly or by implication along the ill-defined\r\nfrontier of “magic and astronomy.” In concluding the present section\r\nlet us make the one further observation that while Albert describes\r\nmagic differently and even inconsistently in different passages, it is\r\nevident enough that he is trying to describe the same thing all the\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. _Marvelous Virtues in Nature_\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Properties of the lion.]\r\n\r\nSo many instances have already been given from other authors of the\r\noccult virtues ascribed to parts of animals that we shall note in\r\nAlbert’s treatise on animals only two or three passages, chiefly\r\nfor purposes of comparison. The properties which he ascribes to the\r\ncarcass of the lion,[1844] for instance, bear a certain resemblance to\r\nPliny’s paragraph on its medicinal virtues and to Thomas of Cantimpré’s\r\ncompilation concerning it, yet are considerably different. Its fat is\r\nhotter than that of other animals, and they flee from anyone who is\r\nanointed with it, while fumigation therewith keeps wolves away from\r\nsheep. A diet of lion’s flesh benefits paralytics. Garments wrapped\r\nin its skin are secure from moths, and the hair falls out of a wolf’s\r\nskin which is left near a lion’s skin. If the tooth of a lion which is\r\ncalled _caninus_ is suspended about a boy’s neck before he loses his\r\nfirst teeth, he will be free from toothache when his second teeth come.\r\nLion’s fat mixed with other unguents removes blotches, and rubbing\r\ncancer with its blood cures that disease. Drinking a little of its gall\r\ncures jaundice; its liver in wine checks pain in the liver. Its brain,\r\nif eaten, causes madness; but remedies deafness, if inserted in the ear\r\nwith some strong oil. Its testicle, administered pulverized with roses,\r\ncauses sterility--a case, it would seem, of sympathetic magic operating\r\nby contraries. But no doctrine of sympathy and antipathy is needed to\r\nexplain the further assertion that its excrement drunk with wine makes\r\none abhor wine.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Nasty recipes: illusory lights.]\r\n\r\nThe last two items are very characteristic of Albert’s section on\r\nquadrupeds, where the medicinal and other properties of such parts as\r\n_stercus_, _virga_, and _testiculus_ are incessantly mentioned, and\r\nare sometimes used in charms, as in the following: “Si virga lupi in\r\nalicuius nomine viri vel mulieris ligetur, non poterit coire donec\r\nnodus ille solutus fuerit.”[1845] The saliva of a fasting human being\r\ncures abscesses and removes scars and blotches.[1846] It kills serpent\r\nor scorpion, if it falls into its mouth or wound so as to reach its\r\ninner parts. If the tip of an arrow or sword has touched the lips of a\r\nfasting man, it inflicts a poisonous wound, say those who have tested\r\nit. Others say that if the wax and dirt from dogs’ ears are smeared\r\non wicks of new cotton, and these are placed in a crucible in green\r\noil and lighted, the heads of persons present will appear entirely\r\nbald.[1847] This sort of half-magical, half-chemical experiment with\r\nvarious combustible or illuminating compositions, which are supposed\r\nto produce optical or other illusions, is not infrequently met with in\r\nmedieval manuscripts, especially alchemical ones, and we shall in a\r\nlater chapter encounter further specimens thereof in works ascribed to\r\nAlbert himself.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Dragons.]\r\n\r\nAlbert is rather unusually sceptical concerning dragons, which are\r\ngenerally the theme of so many marvelous stories. That a dragon is\r\nlarge enough to crush an elephant with a twist of its tail, that the\r\nEthiopians eat the flesh of dragons to cool themselves, that dragons\r\nare afraid of thunder and therefore enchanters imitate it with drums\r\nin order to capture dragons and ride on them through space,[1848]--all\r\nsuch assertions Albert treats as rumors rather than tested facts.\r\nHe also suggests that meteors or flaming vapors have been mistaken\r\nfor dragons flying through the air and breathing forth fire. We have\r\nalready, however, heard his tale of a serpent with a human face.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The basilisk.]\r\n\r\nAlbert still believes, moreover, that the mere glance and hiss of the\r\nbasilisk are fatal. But while the reptile’s glance will kill as far as\r\nits vision extends, its hiss is not fatal as far as it can be heard but\r\nonly as far as it is propagated by the basilisk’s breath.[1849] Albert\r\nrejects as neither true nor reasonable Pliny’s assertion that if a man\r\nsees a basilisk first, his glance is fatal to it. “Nor do Avicenna and\r\nSemerion, philosophers who tell what they have experienced, mention\r\nthis.” But Albert repeats Pliny’s story of the horseman who was\r\nkilled by touching with the end of his long lance a corpse slain by\r\na basilisk. He rejects, however, as false and impossible the notion\r\nthat the basilisk is generated from a cock’s egg, and the books of\r\nwise philosophers do not support the assertion that there is a flying\r\nvariety of basilisk. But scattering the ashes of a basilisk expels\r\nspiders and other venomous creatures, and hence in antiquity its ashes\r\nwere scattered in temples. Hermes says that silver rubbed with its ash\r\ntakes on the splendor and weight and solidity of gold; Hermes also\r\nteaches that the basilisk is generated in glass, but Albert interprets\r\nthis as an allusion to some alchemical elixir by which metals are\r\ntransmuted.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Remedies for falcons and mad dogs.]\r\n\r\nVery amusing are the detailed recipes for every ailment of the birds\r\nin the chapters on the infirmities of falcons.[1850] These appear to\r\nbe culled chiefly from the works on falconry of the Emperor Frederick\r\nand of King William, one of the Norman line which preceded him in the\r\nkingdom of Sicily. To make the birds fierce one is advised to feed them\r\nflesh soaked in urine. If a falcon develops a cataract, one should\r\ninject into its eye a mixture of pulverized fennel seed and the milk\r\nof a woman bearing a male child. Several prayers and incantations are\r\nrecommended for use when taking up the falcon in the morning, when\r\nreleasing it in fowling, and in order to preserve it from injury from\r\neagles. In the last case the words to be repeated are, “Leo conquers\r\nof the tribe of Judah, root of David, Alleluia.” Albert adds, however,\r\n“But these last items,” meaning probably the incantations, “are not so\r\nreasonable as the first,” meaning probably the more purely medicinal\r\ndirections. Equally diverting is a cure of a mad dog borrowed by Albert\r\nfrom a king of Valencia. For nine days the hound should be so immersed\r\nin hot water that his hind legs barely touch the ground while his fore\r\nlegs are held erect. After that his head should be shaved and his\r\nhair well plucked out so that the skin is wounded. Then he should be\r\nanointed with beet juice and ducked often and soaked in the same juice.\r\n“And if he eats anything, give him some pith of the elder tree, for it\r\nwill do him good. And if this treatment fails to benefit him within the\r\nspace of seven days, kill him, for he is incurable.”[1851]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Habits and remedies of animals.]\r\n\r\nAlbert’s treatise on animals not only ascribes marvelous properties\r\nand medicinal virtues to various portions of their carcasses, but\r\nalso continues to some extent the tradition of crediting them with\r\nsemi-human intelligence and medical knowledge. Albert discredits,\r\nhowever, the report of the adultery of the lioness with the leopard\r\nand her craftiness in concealing it, and he also rejects as contrary\r\nto the wise provision of nature the statement that the lion suffers\r\ncontinually from quartan fever.[1852] But he believes that a sick\r\nlion cures itself by eating an ape or drinking the blood of a dog.\r\nEven the tortoise (_tortuca_?), although it seems to Albert a sort\r\nof reptile and lacking in “noble virtues of the soul,” yet from mere\r\nnatural sagacity eats wild origanum after it has eaten the viper in\r\norder to overcome the chill of the venom by the heat of the herb.[1853]\r\nAnd someone in Aristotle’s time learned by experience that it will not\r\neat a viper except in a place where this herb is available, and that\r\nif the herb is removed while it is eating the viper it will die from\r\nwant of it. Avicenna tells a similar experience of an old man who was\r\nan experienced hunter and deserving credence. He saw a bird of slow\r\nmovement and weak flight fighting with a viper. As often as it was\r\nwounded, it would retreat, eat some of a certain herb, and then return\r\nrenewed to the fight. The observer covertly removed the herb and when\r\nthe bird returned again and failed to find it, it raised a great outcry\r\nand died. From the old hunter’s description of the plant’s shape and\r\ncolor Avicenna judged it to be wild lettuce (_lectuca agrestis_).\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The virtues of herbs.]\r\n\r\nThus the remedies employed by animals bring us to the virtues of\r\nherbs. The “divine effects” of certain plants, as we have seen, Albert\r\nregards as lying within the province of magic rather than that of his\r\ntreatise on plants, but he mentions a few, such as that planting a\r\ncertain herb on the roof protects the house from lightning,[1854] and\r\nthat carrying another stirs up quarrels and hatreds,[1855] while a\r\nwoman who wears a third about her neck will not become pregnant.[1856]\r\nBut he believes that there is strong virtue in herbs in general.\r\nTheir elemental qualities are unusually acute and closely akin to the\r\nexcellencies of the pure elements. They grow close to the ground and\r\n“recede less from the first fertilizing humor in the earth.”[1857] In\r\nthem matter predominates more and the form of the vegetable soul is\r\nless developed than in other kinds of vegetation. Consequently they are\r\nmore efficacious in altering other bodies and are used by physicians\r\nmore than any other class of remedies.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Their medicinal use.]\r\n\r\nMost, indeed, of the virtues of herbs mentioned by Albert are\r\nmedicinal. Sometimes the method of applying them is injudicious, as\r\nwhen a root of parsley is hung from the neck to cure toothache, or\r\nartemisia is bound to the legs to prevent wayfarers from feeling\r\nweariness.[1858] More often, however, our criticism is that the same\r\ndisease is represented as curable by too many different plants, or that\r\na single herb is made a cure for a long list of very miscellaneous and\r\nunrelated ills, not content with which Albert often concludes, “And it\r\nhas many other effects.” Selecting an example at random, we may note\r\nwhat he says of the nasturtium.[1859] “It possesses acidity, is hot\r\nand dry, acts as a gentle purgative and laxative, and dries up the\r\nputridity of an empty belly. Used as a potion and liniment, it keeps\r\nthe hair from falling out. Combined with salt and water, it helps\r\nabscesses and carbuncles, and mixed with honey, it eradicates Persian\r\nFire and is good for all softening of the muscles. It purifies the\r\nlungs and relieves asthma by its sharp, cutting qualities. It warms the\r\nstomach and liver and cures enlarged spleen, but its disturbing quality\r\nis bad for the stomach. _Auget coitum et multiplicat menstrua et eiicit\r\nfoetum, sed tamen si non teratur et confringatur, retinet ipsum._ It is\r\ngood for venomous bites, and if carefully prepared, works many other\r\neffects.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Occult virtue of herbs due to the stars.]\r\n\r\nAccording to Albert the properties of plants are produced by the\r\ncombination of five virtues: that of the element which preponderates\r\nin the composition of the plant, the cooperating virtue of the other\r\nelements which are mixed with it, the virtue of the proportion in\r\nwhich they are mixed, the influence of the stars, and the virtue of\r\nthe vegetable soul. “The virtue of the place (where the plant grows)\r\nand the virtue of the surrounding air are also effective, but they do\r\nnot enter into the plant’s nature so essentially as the aforesaid five\r\nvirtues.”[1860] “Its specific form,” upon which its occult virtues\r\nlargely depend, is given to the plant by the motion of the heavens,\r\nespecially by the movement of the planets through the circle of the\r\nzodiac,[1861] and their position in relation to the fixed stars. Plants\r\nreceive this influence at the time of their formation, when vapors,\r\npotentially seminal and formative, ascend from the depths of earth and\r\nmeet the dewy air as it descends.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Occult virtue of stones.]\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary to repeat the marvelous powers attributed to\r\nparticular gems and stones by Albert in his treatise on minerals,\r\nsince they are either copied from or similar to those of Marbod, Costa\r\nben Luca, and Constantinus Africanus. What, however, he has to say on\r\nthe general subject of their occult virtue is worth noting. He states\r\nthat many doubt if stones really have such powers as to cure ulcers,\r\ncounteract poisons, conciliate human hearts, and win victories. Such\r\nsceptics contend that a compound substance like a gem can exert only\r\nsuch powers as one can account for from the elements which enter\r\ninto its composition and the composition itself. Albert grants that\r\nthe wonders worked by means of stones seem “more prodigious and\r\nmarvelous” than those produced by simple substances, that the physical\r\nconstitution of stones does not seem to justify the existence of such\r\npowers in them, and that “the cause of the virtue of stones is indeed\r\noccult.” But he maintains that such occult virtues are well established\r\nby experience, “since we see the magnet attract iron and the adamant\r\nrestrict that virtue in the magnet.”[1862] Albert has seen with his own\r\neyes a sapphire which removed ulcers.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Due to the stars.]\r\n\r\nAlbert finds that students of nature (_physiologi_)--it will be noted\r\nthat the word cannot possibly refer here to the authors of such works\r\nas the _Physiologus_--have assigned very diverse causes for this\r\nmarvelous virtue of stones. He rejects as “most absurd” the suggestion\r\nof certain Pythagoreans that it is due to the action of souls or of\r\na world-soul in stones. Alexander Aphrodisiensis argues from the\r\noperations of alchemy that some chemical change makes the compound\r\nstone far more potent than any or all of its constituents. Plato\r\nthinks that all inferior objects are imbued with superior ideas; Hermes\r\nand Avicenna suggest that celestial virtue is responsible. Albert\r\nhimself concludes that the occult virtue of stones resides in their\r\nspecific forms, in which, as in the case of herbs, the influence of the\r\nstars plays the chief part. Albert’s discussion of the virtue of gems\r\nis repeated in a _Summa philosophiae_ ascribed to Robert Grosseteste,\r\nbut in part at least written after his death. The author regards\r\n“Albert of Cologne” as having “spoken more certainly than others in\r\nthis matter.”[1863]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Pseudo-Albert _De lapidibus_.]\r\n\r\nAlbert’s discussion of the engraving of images and seals on stones\r\nin his treatise on minerals has already been mentioned in connection\r\nwith his attitude toward magic and will come up again in connection\r\nwith his attitude towards astrology. Besides the treatise on minerals\r\nthere seems to be another work on stones ascribed to Albert which is\r\nspurious. It deals with the colors and virtues of stones, and, like\r\nThetel and the fourteenth book of Thomas of Cantimpré, with their\r\nsculpture and consecration.[1864]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Alchemy.]\r\n\r\nIn his third book concerning minerals Albert judiciously discusses\r\nalchemy, citing Avicenna and Hermes especially. He says that of all the\r\narts alchemy most closely imitates nature.[1865] Albert regards the\r\nvarious metals as distinct species, and hardly accepts the assertions\r\nof Hermes, Gilgil, Empedocles, and other alchemists that in each\r\nmetal there are several species and natures, one manifest and another\r\noccult,[1866] one external and another internal, one superficial and\r\nanother deep. Albert then considers the remark of Avicenna, incorrectly\r\nascribed by some to Aristotle, that the alchemists cannot alter species\r\nbut can make them appear alike, as when they color copper so that it\r\nseems to be gold.[1867] Avicenna has also remarked in his _Alchemy_,\r\nhowever, that species can perhaps be reduced to first matter and then\r\nby the aid of the art formed into the species of the desired metal.\r\nAlbert thinks that perhaps, as physicians by their medicines purge away\r\ncorrupt matter and afterwards restore health, so skilled alchemists\r\nmay purify a great mass of quicksilver and sulphur, which according\r\nto Avicenna are the material constituents of all metals, and then\r\ncombine these in due ratio of elemental and celestial virtues for the\r\ncomposition of the metal which they wish to obtain.[1868] But those who\r\nmerely color the metal white or yellow, while the species of the baser\r\nmetal remains in the material, are beyond doubt deceivers and do not\r\nmake true gold or true silver. Unfortunately all alchemists proceed in\r\nthis fashion to a greater or less extent, and Albert has subjected gold\r\nmade by them to fire and has found that it is finally consumed, after\r\nit has stood the test of fire perhaps six or seven times.\r\n\r\nAlbert thus suggests that the transmutation of metals by means of\r\nhuman art is possible, although he does not regard the alchemists as\r\nhaving yet employed the right method. But it is hard to see how Peter\r\nof Prussia got the notion that Albert had condemned the art of alchemy\r\nin the _De mineralibus_ and could not be the author of a treatise\r\non the subject.[1869] In other passages Albert speaks of alchemy\r\nwithout disapproval and apparently with respect. He cites “alchemical\r\nexperiments” concerning the evaporation of water when heated.[1870]\r\nHe repeats the argument of Alexander of Aphrodisias that the occult\r\nvirtues of gems are due to the mixture of the elements in them, as is\r\nproved by the operations of alchemy, in which simple substances effect\r\nlittle, but when mixed together produce truly marvelous effects.[1871]\r\nAnd as one instance of the influence exerted by the moon he states that\r\nskilled alchemists work during the waxing of the moon because then\r\nthey produce purer metals and purer stones, especially when they are\r\nreally expert and do not hurry their operations but await the opportune\r\ntime when the process will be aided by celestial virtue.[1872] On the\r\nwhole, however, as these passages show, Albert’s mentions of alchemy\r\nare mainly allusive. He does not treat of it fully in his Aristotelian\r\ntreatises apparently because, as we saw earlier, he regarded it as a\r\nseparate subject from physics or physical science, bordering more on\r\nthe field of natural magic. The question therefore next arises whether\r\nhe ever wrote a work or works dealing especially with alchemy, just as\r\nthe question will arise whether he ever wrote any works in the field of\r\nnatural magic.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Works of alchemy ascribed to Albert.]\r\n\r\nBerthelot gives the impression in his _La Chimie au Moyen Age_[1873]\r\nthat there was but one alchemistic treatise current under the name of\r\nAlbertus Magnus. This he describes as a serious and methodical work\r\nbut written a little after Albert’s time. But the manuscripts seem to\r\ncontain several, or rather, nearly a dozen, different works of alchemy\r\nascribed to Albert.[1874] In the University library at Bologna alone\r\nthere appear to be six different alchemistic treatises ascribed to\r\nAlbert, and three of them in one manuscript.[1875] In one manuscript\r\nof the British Museum is a rather lengthy “_Practica_ of Brother\r\nAlbert in alchemy which is called by the same the Secret of Secrets,”\r\nin seven books. The text, however, cites Albert’s work on minerals,\r\nstating that the Latins in general have discovered very little for\r\nthemselves experimentally in alchemy but have been dependent upon\r\ntranslations from other languages, but that “Albert, once of Ratisbon,\r\nthe crown of the Latins,” studied it and discovered some secrets by\r\nexperimentation, as he bears witness in his “_De mineralibus_.”[1876]\r\nPresently Albert is again cited in a list of old masters who labored\r\nat this art, Alexander the Great, Dioscorides, and others.[1877] In\r\nanother manuscript at the British Museum is a much briefer _Of the\r\nhidden things of nature_ ascribed to Albertus Magnus.[1878] What seems\r\nto be still another brief tract on alchemy ascribed to Albert occurs\r\nin a manuscript at Cambridge. It concludes with the statement, “And I\r\nAlbert say that I have tested these two operations and that there is\r\nno other perfect work by me except these two works, and they are true.\r\nEuclid, too, and many philosophers agree with me and assert that all\r\nthe value of this art consists in Mercury and the Moon and in Mercury\r\nand the Sun, and you should know that all others are vain and illusory.\r\nThanks to God.”[1879]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A more detailed description of one of them: preface.]\r\n\r\nOf these various treatises in alchemy ascribed to Albert we shall now\r\nconsider in more detail the one which has been included in editions of\r\nhis works,[1880] and which is perhaps the most likely of any of them\r\nto be genuine. It is ascribed to Albert in a manuscript list of the\r\nwritings of Dominicans drawn up before 1350, and also by Pignon.[1881]\r\nIt is also an unusually intelligible treatise for a work of alchemy and\r\nso the better lends itself to description and summary. After opening in\r\ndevout tone with praise of God and invocation of His aid, the author\r\nproceeds to tell in somewhat Albertine style how he has traversed many\r\nregions, provinces, cities, and castles with great labor for the sake\r\nof the science which is called alchemy, and has diligently inspected\r\nthe books on the subject by men of erudition and learning, but has\r\nfound nothing true in them. He has also encountered “many very rich\r\nmen, scholars, abbots, _praepositi_, canons, physicians, and illiterate\r\npersons,” who have expended much money and toil without result. He did\r\nnot despair, however, but went to infinite expense and labor, keeping\r\nhis eyes open and constantly moving from place to place, until at last\r\nhe found what he sought “not by any science of mine but by the grace of\r\nthe Holy Spirit.” He therefore, the least of philosophers, intends to\r\nwrite to his friends and associates concerning this art, true, easy,\r\nand infallible, yet so that seeing they shall not see and hearing they\r\nshall not understand. And he adjures them to keep it secret and not to\r\nshow his book to the foolish.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Experimental method and equipment.]\r\n\r\nAfter this preface, the first of the fifty-seven chapters, for the\r\nmost part brief, into which the treatise is divided, lists various\r\n“errors” which have made the previous efforts of alchemists a failure.\r\nThe author also strikes an experimental key-note for his work, stating\r\nthat after seeing so many fail he has decided to write true and\r\napproved works and the best which all the philosophers have to offer,\r\nworks furthermore in which he has labored and which he has tested by\r\nexperience, and he will write nothing but what he has seen with his own\r\neyes.[1882] After suggesting a derivation for the word “alchemy”[1883]\r\nand a theory for the origin of metals and “proof that alchemy is a\r\ntrue art,”[1884] the author lays down eight precepts for alchemists to\r\nfollow. The alchemist should work silently and secretly or he may be\r\narrested as a counterfeiter. He should have a laboratory, “a special\r\nhouse away from the sight of men in which there are two or three\r\nrooms in which experiments may be conducted.”[1885] He must observe\r\ntime and seasons; the process of sublimation, for instance, cannot be\r\nsuccessfully performed in winter. He must be a sedulous, persevering,\r\nuntiring, and constant worker. In his operations he must observe due\r\norder: first _contributio_; then _sublimatio_; third, _fixio_; fourth,\r\n_calcinatio_; fifth, _solutio_; sixth, _coagulatio_; processes which\r\nare further explained in chapters 30 to 35. All the vessels which\r\nhe uses should be made of glass. He should fight shy of princes and\r\npotentates, and finally, should have plenty of money. Chapters four to\r\neight then deal with the subject of furnaces, and chapter nine tells\r\nhow to glaze clay vessels.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Differences between transmuted and natural metals.]\r\n\r\nIn the tenth chapter, besides discussing what are the four “spirits”\r\nof metals which dye or color, the author states his opinion as to the\r\nextent to which metals can be transmuted. He believes that metals can\r\nbe produced by alchemy which are the equal of natural metals in almost\r\nall their qualities and effects, except that the iron of alchemy is\r\nnot attracted by the stone adamant, and that the gold of alchemy does\r\nnot stimulate the human heart or cure leprosy, while a wound inflicted\r\nby it swells up as one made by natural gold would not do. “But in\r\nevery other operation, hammering, testing, and color, it will endure\r\nforever.” In the two following chapters the author discusses what the\r\nElixir is and the kinds of medicines.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Substances and processes of alchemy.]\r\n\r\nA number of chapters are next devoted to description of various\r\nminerals, chemicals, dyes, and coloring matter, such as mercury,\r\nsulphur, orpiment, arsenic, salts of ammonia, common salt, various\r\nother salts, azure, minium, ceruse, and so on. We are then instructed\r\nin various processes such as whitening quicksilver or sulphur\r\nor orpiment or arsenic, the making of powders, solutions, and\r\ndistillations, leading up finally in the last two chapters to two brief\r\nrecipes for the making of the precious metals. The general plan of this\r\ntreatise is one to which many others conform; it is noteworthy further\r\nfor the absence of mysticism and magic procedure.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ligatures and suspensions.]\r\n\r\nWe have already noted in Albert’s works some instances of marvels\r\nworked by herbs bound to the body or suspended from the neck. In his\r\ntreatise on plants he cited books concerning physical ligatures[1886]\r\nfor the divine effects of plants with which magic is especially\r\nconcerned. But in his treatise on minerals, after stating that the\r\nmarvels worked by images engraved on gems cannot be explained by the\r\nlaws of physical science but require a knowledge of “astronomy” and\r\nmagic and necromancy,[1887] he adds that ligatures and suspensions\r\nof stones seem to operate naturally and belong more to physical\r\nscience.[1888] He cites, however, Socrates, probably through the medium\r\nof Costa ben Luca, to the effect that ligatures and suspensions are\r\none of four kinds of incantations, and that they affect the mind,\r\ndepressing or elating it and so affecting the health of the body.\r\nThis half-sceptical attitude seems to influence Albert little, for he\r\nstates that for the present he intends to treat only of ligatures and\r\nsuspensions of stones, of which he proceeds to list examples for a page\r\nand a half drawn largely from Costa ben Luca’s treatise. In his work on\r\nanimals Albert again quotes Costa ben Luca to the effect that dogs will\r\nnot bite the wearer of a dog’s heart.[1889] Others say that they will\r\nnot bark at one who holds in his hand the tooth of a black dog, “and so\r\nrobbers carry such a tooth with them at night.” Albert further finds in\r\nthe book of sixty animals--probably the work ascribed to Rasis--that\r\ndog’s teeth should be suspended from the neck of a patient suffering\r\nfrom jaundice.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Incantations.]\r\n\r\nAlbert does not expressly discuss the power of words or incantations.\r\nIt is rarely that he repeats any incantations, and it will be\r\nremembered that those which he quoted from books on falcons were\r\naccompanied with a word of caution. His belief in the power of\r\ncharacters or images engraved on gems may be best discussed in\r\nconnection with his attitude towards astrology.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fascination.]\r\n\r\nThe power of fascination possessed by one human being over another is\r\ntouched upon by Albert in three different treatises.[1890] We have\r\nalready heard him identify it with magic. He cites certain Pythagoreans\r\nas affirming that the soul of a man or other animal can act upon\r\nanother, fascinating it and impeding its working. He quotes Hermes as\r\ntelling Esclepius that man is so endowed with divine intellect and\r\nraised above the world, that its matter follows his thought, and so\r\nthe sage can work transformations and miracles in nature or fascinate\r\nanother person through sight or some other sense. Avicenna and Algazel\r\n“say that souls can in so far conform to the celestial intelligence\r\nthat it will alter material bodies at their pleasure, and then such a\r\nman will work wonders.” It is not clear, however, to what extent Albert\r\nagrees with the authorities he has cited; he remarks that the power of\r\nthe soul in fascination can scarcely be proved by philosophy, but he\r\nperhaps simply means that it can be proved by magic.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Physiognomy.]\r\n\r\nIn a passage of his treatise on animals[1891] Albert describes\r\nphysiognomy as a science which divines a man’s character from the\r\nphysical form of the various parts of his body. He explains, however,\r\nthat the configuration of one’s physical features does not absolutely\r\nforce one to a corresponding course of action. Thus he upholds human\r\nfree will against a mechanistic view of man, or rather he shows that\r\nthe physiognomists themselves do. He cites Aristotle, to whom we have\r\nseen that a treatise on physiognomy was ascribed, for the following\r\nstory: The disciples of Hippocrates made a perfect image of him and\r\nsubmitted it to an excellent physiognomist, who declared it the\r\nlikeness of a man given to luxury, deceit, and lusts of the body. The\r\ndisciples were angered at this slur upon the character of their master,\r\nwho they knew lived a sober and upright life; but Hippocrates himself\r\ntold them that the physiognomist had judged aright as to his natural\r\ntraits, and that it was only by love of philosophy and integrity and a\r\nlife of study and effort that he had triumphed over nature. A treatise\r\non chiromancy is ascribed to Albert in more than one manuscript.[1892]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Aristotle on divination from dreams.]\r\n\r\nIn the third book of his _De somno et vigilia_[1893] Albert\r\ncomplains that Aristotle’s treatment of divination from dreams\r\nis unsatisfactory; being “brief, deficient in proof, naïve,\r\nunphilosophical, imperfect,” and having “many doubtful points because\r\nit leaves the causes of such dreams uncertain.” Aristotle’s attitude\r\nwas in fact a vacillating one, since he found it “not easy either to\r\ndespise or to believe” in that kind of divination. Yet Roger Bacon\r\ntells us that one reason why the study of the books of Aristotle\r\non natural philosophy was forbidden at Paris before 1237 was this\r\nthird book of his _De somno et vigilia_ dealing with divination from\r\ndreams.[1894] But perhaps this was because of commentaries of Averroes\r\nwhich accompanied it or errors in translation of which Bacon speaks.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Albert on divination from dreams.]\r\n\r\nLittle as Aristotle said, he came nearer the truth in Albert’s\r\nopinion than any other extant philosophers, among whom there is great\r\ndiversity of view. However, that dreams are prophetic “is no idle\r\nreport but the testimony of experience,”[1895] and Albert thinks\r\nthat there is scarcely anyone who has not been warned in his dreams\r\nof many future events. “Socrates put great faith in divination from\r\ndreams.”[1896] Interpretation of dreams is necessary, for dreams\r\ncannot be exact images of future events, since these are as yet\r\nnon-existent.[1897] Predictions from dreams, even if correctly made,\r\ndo not invariably come true, just as medical prognostications and the\r\npredictions of augurs--of whom we are surprised to hear Albert speak\r\napprovingly--sometimes fail owing to the arising of some conflicting\r\ncause.[1898] The dreamer must be free from care and passion. Albert\r\nagrees with Aristotle that dreams requiring interpretation do not come\r\nfrom God but have a natural cause; while the future cannot be foretold\r\nfrom dreams which have an accidental cause.[1899] More specifically\r\nhe finds the cause of dreams not, like Socrates and Plato, in demons\r\nand corporeal and incorporeal gods,[1900] nor, like Democritus, in\r\natoms streaming from the stars through the pores of the dreamer into\r\nhis inmost soul, but in the motion of the stars acting upon the\r\nbody of man, who is in a sense a microcosm or image of the universe\r\n(_imago mundi_).[1901] The interpreter of dreams must be quick to see\r\nassociations and similarities from the realm of nature and of art,\r\nhe must understand astronomy and astrology, and the state of health\r\nand mind of the dreamer.[1902] Albert again discusses divination\r\nfrom dreams in much the same way in the second part of his _Summa de\r\ncreaturis_ and in his _De apprehensione_.[1903]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Augury.]\r\n\r\nIn the _De somno et vigilia_ he mentions one further variety of vision\r\n“when the celestial influence is so strong that it affects even while\r\nawake one whose attention is not occupied by the distractions of\r\nsense.” Such visions move the bodies of animals even when they are\r\nawake, “and then their movements have some future signification, which\r\naugurs endeavor to note and interpret. On so much ground of reason is\r\ndivination by augury based.”[1904]\r\n\r\n\r\nV. _Attitude Toward Astrology_\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: His emphasis upon the influence of the stars.]\r\n\r\nWe come finally to that influence of the heavens and stars which makes\r\nthe art of augury and divination from dreams possible, which serves to\r\nexplain the occult virtue of herbs and stones, and to that “astronomy,”\r\nor astrology as we should say, which is so closely associated with the\r\nscience of the magi and with necromancy. Albert’s astrological view’s\r\ncrop out in almost all his scientific treatises rather than merely in\r\nthose dealing with astronomical subjects, such as the _Meteorology_,\r\nthe _De coelo et mundo_, and the _De causis et procreatione universi_.\r\nEspecially astrological in character is the treatise _On the Causes\r\nand Properties of the Elements and Planets_.[1905]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Problem of the authorship of the _Speculum astronomiae_.]\r\n\r\nAnother treatise very important in the history of astrology is the\r\n_Speculum astronomiae_, hitherto usually placed among Albert’s\r\nworks[1906] but recently declared by Father Mandonnet[1907] to be\r\nthe work of Roger Bacon. Although Mandonnet adduced no evidence of\r\nmanuscripts in favor of the Baconian authorship, other students of\r\nRoger Bacon[1908] have since unquestioningly accepted this attribution\r\nof the _Speculum_ to him, but I shall show that there is no good reason\r\nfor it. This may best be done, however, by delaying our consideration\r\nof the _Speculum astronomiae_ itself until after we have taken up Roger\r\nBacon and his views. But in our present discussion of Albert’s other\r\nwritings we may break the backbone of Mandonnet’s argument, which is\r\nhis extraordinary contention that Albert did not believe in astrology\r\nand that Roger Bacon was “the only ecclesiastical author in the\r\nsecond half of the thirteenth century who has undertaken the defense\r\nof judicial astrology and of the other occult sciences which depend\r\nmore or less directly upon it.”[1909] Mandonnet criticized Charles\r\nfor saying of Roger Bacon’s astrological views, “These doctrines,\r\nwhich seem contemptible to us, were widespread in the thirteenth\r\ncentury; Albert was not free from them; St. Thomas merely expressed\r\nsome reservations but did not deny the science.” Mandonnet declares\r\nthat Charles “has given no evidence for his conclusion and could not\r\ndo so,”[1910] but our detailed presentation of the opinions of the men\r\nnamed and of others will show that Charles was quite right and that\r\nMandonnet is all wrong.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mandonnet fails to prove Albert hostile to astrology.]\r\n\r\nMandonnet, in fact, gives no sign of having ever candidly examined the\r\nworks of Albert to see what his attitude towards astrology really was,\r\nso that it seems arrant presumption on his part to question Charles’\r\nstatement. And he himself gives no justification for having questioned\r\nit. He cites only one passage directly from Albert’s works, and it is\r\nmerely a repetition of the argument of the saints that the star at\r\nChrist’s birth was a miraculous apparition in the upper air rather\r\nthan the sky.[1911] Then he quotes three passages from the fifteenth\r\ncentury biography of Peter of Prussia as if they were Albert’s own\r\nstatements. If they are, why does not Mandonnet state where they are\r\nto be found in Albert’s works? Also why does he not state that these\r\npassages occur in chapters where Peter is making an effort, none too\r\nsuccessful or disingenuous, to defend Albert from the charge of having\r\ndevoted too much attention to nigromancy and such arts rather than to\r\nmere astrology? Mandonnet does note that Peter believed Albert to be\r\nthe author of the _Speculum astronomiae_, but he does not note that\r\nPeter in these very chapters which he cites relies chiefly on the\r\n_Speculum astronomiae_ to clear Albert from the charge of dabbling in\r\nnigromancy. In brief, Peter proves from the _Speculum_ that Albert did\r\nnot favor nigromancy; then Mandonnet proves from Peter that Albert did\r\nnot believe in astrology and so could not have written the _Speculum_!\r\nIn succeeding chapters[1912] Peter goes on to try to make out from the\r\n_Speculum_ that Albert opposed astrological images and interrogations\r\nand that he was more outspoken against them than Aquinas. But this\r\nMandonnet says nothing of, and it would not fit his argument.\r\n\r\nThe passages from Peter which Mandonnet does select as suited to his\r\npurpose are as follows:\r\n\r\n “The pursuits of magicians and necromancers are evil\r\n and superfluous and forbidden by the church.... That\r\n _mathematici_ or idolaters sometimes predict the future is\r\n the outcome of conjecture and fatuous presumption, not of\r\n certitude.... There are three things to which some men have\r\n recourse, namely, sorcerers, enchanters, and _mathematici_,\r\n but which really are not wisdom but foolishness, for the\r\n Chaldeans rely on such methods. The _mathematici_ seek to\r\n reduce the effects of the stars to fixed hours, and those\r\n who investigate such things are far from the one science of\r\n God.”[1913]\r\n\r\nEven if these passages are from Albert’s works, they are no proof that\r\nhe condemned astrology. Roger Bacon penned very similar passages, and\r\nthe _Speculum astronomiae_ expresses no approval of either enchanters\r\nor sorcerers or magicians or _mathematici_. We have already repeatedly\r\nseen that _mathematici_ was used in two senses and that one might\r\ncondemn the _mathematici_ as diviners and yet accept astrology. Albert\r\nhimself made such a distinction in his _Commentary on Matthew_[1914]\r\nwhere he differentiates between two, or rather three, kinds of\r\nmathematics. One is the abstract science in our present sense of the\r\nword; the other, more properly called _mathesis_ and pronounced with a\r\nlong middle syllable, is “divination by the stars,” but it in turn may\r\nbe either good or bad, superstitious or scientific. Thus it is proved\r\nby a direct examination of Albert’s writings that, contrary to the\r\nimpression which Mandonnet strives to give by his citation from Peter\r\nof Prussia, even in his theological works Albert did not condemn all\r\n_mathematici_ even, to say nothing of astrology. And we have further\r\nseen that in his scientific writings he sometimes does not condemn\r\neven magic. We shall now proceed to show from numerous passages in\r\nother works than the _Speculum astronomiae_ how favorably inclined\r\ntoward astrology Albert really was.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Nature of the heavens and the stars.]\r\n\r\nAlbert accepts the Aristotelian description of the sky and heavenly\r\nbodies as formed of a fifth element distinct from the four elements\r\nof which earthly objects are composed.[1915] In another passage he\r\nsubdivides the heavenly substance into three elements composing\r\nrespectively the sun, the moon and stars, and the sky apart from the\r\ncelestial bodies.[1916] In any case the stars are nobler than inferior\r\nbodies, “less involved in the shadows and privations of matter,” and\r\ncloser to the first cause of the universe.[1917] Their motion is\r\neternal, unchangeable, incorruptible.[1918] Some have called them\r\nanimals but Albert holds that they are not animals in the sense that we\r\napply that word to inferior creatures.[1919]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The First Cause and the spheres.]\r\n\r\nAgain like Aristotle, Albert regards the heavens and stars as\r\ninstruments of the first mover or intelligence, just as the hand is the\r\ninstrument of the human intellect in making works of art.[1920] They\r\nare mediums between the first cause and matter. Albert believes in a\r\nnumber of heavens “existing from the first heaven to the sphere of the\r\nmoon.”[1921] The first mover moves the first heaven and through it the\r\nother spheres included within it. Whether every other heaven has its\r\nown celestial intelligence to move it is a question upon which Albert\r\nis somewhat obscure.[1922] Others certainly thought so. He mentions,\r\nfor instance, the opinion of certain Arabs that floods are due to the\r\nimagination of the intelligence which moves the sphere of the moon, and\r\nconcedes that there is some truth in it.[1923] The ancient Stoics and\r\nEpicureans, he tells us in another passage, ascribed divinity to the\r\nvirtue of the circle of the zodiac, which ruled and governed life under\r\nthe God of gods, as they called the First Cause. Apuleius in the _De\r\ndeo Socratis_ says that they called the twelve signs incorporeal gods,\r\nand the planets and other stars corporeal gods, and the chief effects\r\nof the celestial virtue upon inferior nature terrestrial gods.[1924]\r\nBut probably Albert mentions this merely as an illustration of the\r\ngreat influence exerted by the circle of the zodiac. In a third passage\r\nhe says that the movers of the celestial spheres, whom the philosophers\r\nhave called celestial intelligences, are mediate causes between the\r\nFirst Cause and matter; but he presently adds that philosophers\r\nof better understanding have said that there is only one Mover of\r\neverything, and that the so-called movers of the other spheres are\r\nbut the virtues and members of the first heaven and its Mover.[1925]\r\nTranslated from terms of Aristotelian physics into those of Christian\r\ntheology, this means that the stars are merely God’s instruments, and\r\nthat, if there are spirits or intelligences delegated to move the\r\nparticular heavens, these angels are also merely God’s agents.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Things on earth ruled by the stars.]\r\n\r\nSince the celestial spheres and the stars are the instruments and\r\nmediums through which the First Cause governs the world of inferior\r\ncreation, it follows that the four elements are generated by the\r\nmotion of the heavens and that plants, stones, minerals, animals--in\r\nshort, whatever exists in the inferior world is caused by the motion\r\nof the superior bodies. This general law that the world of nature and\r\nof life on this earth is governed by the movements of the stars is\r\nexpressly repeated again and again in Albert’s works, and its truth\r\nis assumed even oftener.[1926] We may note by way of illustration a\r\nfew of the specific applications of this general law to be found in\r\nAlbert’s writings. Arguing the question whether life is possible in\r\nthe torrid zone at the equator, Albert points out that the rays of the\r\nstars are more multiplied there and fall perpendicularly and directly\r\nand therefore are even more favorable to the generation of life than in\r\nour climate.[1927] In another passage he explains the pagan attribution\r\nof the thunderbolt to the god Jupiter as probably a mistake due to the\r\ninfluence of the planet Jupiter in provoking thunder-storms.[1928] A\r\nthird passage ascribes the height of the inundation of the Nile to the\r\nplanets, stating that Venus and the Moon produce a greater overflow\r\nthan other drier stars.[1929]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Conjunctions.]\r\n\r\nAlbert has a good deal to say of the effects produced by the\r\nconjunctions of the planets,[1930] ascribing to them great mortality\r\nand depopulation, or “great accidents and great prodigies and a\r\ngeneral change of the state of the elements and of the world.”[1931]\r\nTo a conjunction of Jupiter and Mars with others aiding in the sign\r\nof Gemini he attributes pestilential winds and corruption of the air\r\nresulting in a plague by which a multitude of men and beasts suddenly\r\nperish.[1932]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Comets.]\r\n\r\nAlbert also discusses comets, and why they signify wars and the death\r\nof kings and potentates rather than of some poor man.[1933] Their\r\nespecial connection with wars is explained by the astrologer Albumasar\r\nas due to their association with the planet Mars. As for kings, owing\r\nto their greater fame and power, the relation of celestial phenomena\r\nto their destinies has been observed more carefully than the fate of\r\nthe poor, and as their horoscopes have more planetary dignity, so it is\r\ncustomary to refer greater portents to them.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Man and the stars.]\r\n\r\nDespite the allusion just made to royal horoscopes, Albert makes an\r\nexception to the control of the stars over this world in the case of\r\nman. Strictly speaking, however, this is no exception, since man is not\r\nto be classed with other inferiors inasmuch as his soul is a superior\r\nbeing, derived from the First Intelligence and still subject to Its\r\nillumination. “The essence of the soul is wholly and solely from the\r\nfirst cause.”[1934] It is true that Plato says that the soul receives\r\nsomething in each sphere or heaven, memory from the sphere of Saturn\r\nand so on; but Albert regards this doctrine as simply a description\r\nof the process of fitting the mind or soul to the body which it must\r\noccupy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Free will.]\r\n\r\nBut the human reason and will remain free and are not necessarily\r\nsubjected to the movements of the stars. Thus in his theological\r\n_Summa_ Albert admits that the stars govern even the souls, vegetable\r\nand sensitive, of plants and brutes, but denies that they coerce the\r\nloftier rational soul and will of man, who is made in the image of\r\nGod, except as he yields to sin and the flesh.[1935] But this last is\r\na very important exception as we see from a passage in the treatise on\r\nminerals.[1936] “There is in man a double spring of action, namely,\r\nnature and the will; and nature for its part is ruled by the stars,\r\nwhile the will is free; but unless it resists, it is swept along by\r\nnature and becomes mechanical (_induratur_).”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ptolemy on free will.]\r\n\r\nAlbert is aware that neither the Peripatetic philosophy nor the\r\nart of astrology itself slavishly subjects the human mind and will\r\nto the stars.[1937] Rather he keeps citing Ptolemy to show that\r\nthe astrologers themselves do not believe in fatal necessity and\r\nthat consequently the art of astrology is not incompatible with\r\nChristianity.[1938] Ptolemy declares that the mind apprehends the\r\nsuperior bodies in their spheres, and can freely turn away from those\r\nthings towards which the motions of the stars incline it, and can turn\r\ntowards other things by the wisdom of its intellect.[1939] In another\r\npassage Ptolemy is quoted as saying that the effects of the stars can\r\nbe impeded by the science of men skilled in astrology.[1940] If the\r\naverage “astronomer and augur and magician and interpreter of dreams\r\nand visions” has brought divination into disrepute, it is, says Albert\r\nin a third passage, because “almost all men of this class delight\r\nin deception and, being poorly educated, they think that what is\r\nmerely contingent is necessary, and they predict that some event will\r\ncertainly occur; and when it does not, those sciences are cheapened in\r\nthe sight of unskilled men, although the defect is not in the science,\r\nbut in those who abuse it. For this reason wise Ptolemy says that no\r\njudgment should be made except in general terms and with the cautious\r\nreservation that the stars act _per aliud et accidens_ (subject to\r\nother forces and to accidents) and that their significations meet many\r\nimpediments. Moreover, the pursuit of sciences dealing with the future\r\nwould be idle, if one could not avoid what one foresaw.”[1941]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Nativities.]\r\n\r\nBut free will no more restrains Albert than it did Ptolemy from\r\naccepting the art of genethlialogy[1942] or casting of nativities,\r\nas his mention of royal horoscopes has already suggested. He states\r\nelsewhere that the astrologer who understands the virtues of the\r\nsigns of the zodiac and of the stars situated in them at the moment\r\nof birth can prognosticate so far as lies within the influence\r\nof the sky concerning the entire life of the person born.[1943]\r\nIndeed, Albert ascribed to Ptolemy a treatise _De accidentibus parvis\r\nparticularibus_[1944] concerning the events in the life of the\r\nindividual born under this or that constellation, as contrasted with\r\ngreat social events involving large numbers of men such as political\r\nrevolutions, racial migrations, and religious movements, of which\r\nPtolemy is said by Albert to have treated in another work in eight\r\nparts called _De accidentibus magnis universalibus in mundo_.[1945]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Galen on the stars and human generation.]\r\n\r\nAlbert even believed that the influence of the stars upon man was\r\nstronger in some respects than upon other animals. He attributed to\r\nGalen in the treatise _De spermate_ a statement, which I have failed\r\nto find in Galen’s _De semine_ or other works, that “in the generation\r\nof brutes the sperm is not altered according to the order of the hours\r\nand the operations of the planets and signs as it is in man.” Albert\r\nprefers his own explanation of this circumstance to that offered by\r\nGalen. It is that the human body is less material and terrestrial\r\nthan those of the brutes and more nearly resembles the heavens, and\r\nso more readily follows the impressions from the sky, and is a sort\r\nof microcosm as a beast is not. On the other hand, Albert grants that\r\nchanges of the atmosphere and weather are felt more quickly by the\r\nbeasts, who have little else to distract their attention.[1946]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Plato on boys and the stars.]\r\n\r\nAlbert states that Plato, as well as Ptolemy and Galen, proved the\r\ninfluence of the stars upon human beings from the case of boys, who are\r\nstill too young to make much use of free will against nature and the\r\nforce of the heavens. For boys often display a special aptitude, due\r\nto celestial influence, for some one art and become perfect workmen if\r\nthey are trained in it; but if they are forced into another occupation,\r\nnever attain proficiency therein because of their natural ineptitude\r\nfor it.[1947] This is of course the same point as was illustrated\r\nin the pseudo-Aristotelian _Secret of Secrets_ by the story of the\r\nweaver’s son whose horoscope showed a predilection to govern, and the\r\nking’s son whose sole interest was in the mechanical arts.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The doctrine of elections.]\r\n\r\nNaturally Albert finds no difficulty in accepting the astrological\r\ndoctrine of elections, by which the astrologer applies his knowledge\r\nof the movements and effects of the stars and their relationships to\r\ninferior bodies to the selection of a favorable hour for beginning a\r\ncontemplated action.[1948] This doctrine of course implies and requires\r\nfreedom of election and will, and shows that astrology is an operative\r\nas well as divining art. In another passage Albert mentions the famous\r\nand historic, as he regards it, royal example of eugenics, when\r\nNectanabus, the natural father of Alexander, in having intercourse with\r\nhis mother Olympias observed the hour when the Sun was entering Leo and\r\nSaturn was in Taurus, since he wished his son to receive the figure and\r\nforce of those planets.[1949]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Influence of the stars on works of art.]\r\n\r\nIf astrology is thus operative as well as divinatory by its power to\r\nselect the proper and most advantageous moment for entering upon any\r\ncourse of action, and to harness so to speak the power of the planets,\r\nit becomes evident that it is or should be an all-important factor\r\nin all the arts. Albert well asserts therefore that a fundamental\r\nprinciple of this science is that all things which are made by nature\r\nor art are moved first by celestial virtues. He adds that no one\r\ndoubts this concerning nature, and that it is also true of art, in\r\nwhich it is the influence of the stars which incites the artist to\r\nmake something.[1950] The force of the stars is potent in alchemy, for\r\nexample,[1951] for those who try to transmute metals and stones produce\r\npurer metals and stones when the moon is waxing and ascending, “and\r\nparticularly the more skilful they are, not hurrying their operations,\r\nbut awaiting the opportune time when the process is assisted by\r\ncelestial virtue.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Astrological images.]\r\n\r\nOf all the arts the most astrological is that of images, to which\r\nAlbert devotes several chapters of his treatise on minerals.[1952]\r\nIn it images of the stars are engraved on gems or metals at the\r\nfavorable moment when the celestial force is strongest, “and marvels\r\nare worked by such images” because some force from the celestial figure\r\nflows into the work of art.[1953] Incidentally Albert remarks that\r\n“in the science of geomancy” the figures traced from the points are\r\nof no value unless they can be made to conform to such astronomical\r\nimages. Albert mentions several particular astronomical conditions\r\nwhich must be observed in engraving such images. Gems from India are\r\nthe best for this purpose. Some images engraved in antiquity are no\r\nlonger efficacious. Albert gives a number of examples of the effects\r\nexpected from these images.[1954] Stones engraved with Aries or Leo or\r\nSagittarius are good for fevers, dropsy, and paralysis, and are said to\r\nmake their possessors talented and fluent and highly honored. Stones\r\ncarved with Gemini and Libra and Aquarius temper hot humors and promote\r\nfriendship, justice, civility, and observance of law.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Discussion of fate in the _Summa theologiae_.]\r\n\r\nIn the foregoing sketch of Albert’s attitude to astrology, based\r\nchiefly on his writings in the field of natural science, some allusion\r\nhas also been made to his discussion of the subject in his _Summa_ of\r\ntheology, which occurs in the section _On fate_,[1955] “which those\r\nmaintain who deny providence” and which is generally identified with\r\nthe influence of the stars. I have in the main, however, reserved\r\nthis section for separate treatment here, partly because it might be\r\nexpected to show a more conservative and less favorable attitude to\r\nastrology than Albert’s scientific writings, since its authorities\r\nwould presumably be the church fathers, while the scientific works\r\nreflect the views of Aristotle and other Greeks and Arabs. And\r\npartly for another reason, that I am inclined to question whether a\r\nsupplementary passage at the close of this section is by Albert or\r\nadded by another hand.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Attempt to reconcile the fathers with the astronomers.]\r\n\r\nAlthough Albert in this section of the _Summa_ approaches the subject\r\nof the influence of the stars from the unfavorable standpoint of fate\r\ninstead of the favoring one of nature, it is noteworthy that he is not\r\ncontent merely to reproduce the attacks upon astrologers by Augustine\r\nand Gregory of Nyssa, but endeavors to reconcile them with the views\r\nof such scientific or pseudo-scientific authorities as Ptolemy, Hermes\r\nTrismegistus, “Socrates,” and other _Astronomi_. The keynote of his\r\nsolution is found in the definition of Boethius that “Fate is the\r\ndisposition inherent in movable things by which Providence binds each\r\nby its order.” Thus there is no necessary conflict between Providence\r\nand the rule of the stars. But Albert maintains that “neither fate\r\nnor stars nor even Providence takes away from human free will its\r\nliberty of action,”[1956] quoting Ptolemy as usual to the effect that\r\nthe wise man rules the stars and that what the stars do they do _per\r\naliud et accidens_. Albert therefore rejects absolute fatal necessity\r\nas heretical[1957] and the doctrine of the _magnus annus_ that history\r\nrepeats itself as the stars repeat their courses as “horrible.”[1958]\r\nOn the other hand, he insists that “it cannot be denied that the\r\nstars by the figures of their positions pour radiations of diverse\r\nfigures upon the place of generation,”[1959] or that “the stars in\r\ntruth are rulers of the world in those things which are subject to\r\nthe world,”[1960] namely, things corporeal. He also admits that the\r\nsoul may be inclined to the body, though not coerced. Thus a choleric\r\nperson is likely to choose different food and occupation from a\r\nphlegmatic one. Hence Socrates “says that voluntary elections are made\r\nin accordance with the diversity of habits previously existing in the\r\nchooser.”[1961] But Socrates means that such habits incline but do not\r\ncompel us. Later Albert qualifies Gregory of Nyssa’s assertion that our\r\nchoosing precedes “fortune” by again pointing out that the influence of\r\nthe stars “inclines the will to choose this or that.”[1962]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Glossing over Augustine.]\r\n\r\nAlbert has to force his authorities a good deal to arrive at this\r\ncompromise. Thus he interprets Augustine’s grudging concession that\r\nit “can be said not utterly absurdly that certain sidereal afflations\r\neffect mere differences of bodies, as we see that the seasons of\r\nthe year vary with the approach and withdrawal of the sun and some\r\nsorts of things, such as shellfish and the wonderful tides of ocean,\r\nincrease and diminish with the waxing and waning of the moon,”--Albert\r\ninterprets this as favoring his own much more sweeping assertion that\r\nthe stars rule the universe in most respects and change the souls\r\nas well as the bodies of plants and brutes.[1963] Again, Augustine,\r\nasking “What is so pertinent to the body as sex?” contended against\r\nthe astrologers that twins of opposite sex might be born under the\r\nsame constellation; yet Albert maintains that Augustine did not mean\r\nhere that sex of the body is not subject to the stars, but only that\r\nthe constellations are not the sole and entire cause of natural bodily\r\nprocesses, and this for the reasons given above from Ptolemy, namely,\r\nthat the influence of the stars depends upon the capacity of matter to\r\nreceive it and operates _per aliud et accidens_.[1964]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Christ and the stars.]\r\n\r\nIn connection with the question, “Whether Christ was subject soul and\r\nbody to fate or fortune or _eupraxia_?” Albert makes an exception to\r\nthe influence of the stars, and apparently holds that even in respect\r\nto His body Christ was not subject to the power of the constellations.\r\nThe argument is advanced that the Lawgiver is not subject to the\r\nlaw. The opposing contentions that in becoming man Christ assumed\r\nthe defects of our mortality and that, since fate is the disposition\r\ninherent in all mobile objects, Christ was subject to fate as much as\r\nany other man,--these are denied on the ground that Christ became man\r\nvoluntarily and suffered as man only what and when He would, and that\r\nfrom the moment of conception He possessed “grace and all knowledge.”\r\nIt is also held that when the Magi said that they had seen His star in\r\nthe east, they did not mean a constellation ruling His nativity but\r\na new celestial sign which demonstrated the new birth of a heavenly\r\nking.[1965]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Patristic arguments against astrology upheld, but perhaps\r\nnot by Albert.]\r\n\r\nScarcely consistent with the apparent approval with which Albert cited\r\nthe views of the “astronomers” and such a work as the _Tetrabiblos_ or\r\n_Quadripartitum_ of Ptolemy in the preceding discussion, and with the\r\ngeneral tone of much of it, seems a supplementary passage at the close\r\nof this section on fate[1966] after he has apparently completed the\r\ndiscussion of the four questions concerning fate which he put at the\r\nstart. In this supplementary passage are upheld against the “calumnies”\r\nof the astrologers such objections of Augustine and Gregory the Great\r\nto the art of nativities[1967] as that Jacob and Esau were conceived\r\nand born under the same constellation, that a queen and slave may be\r\nconceived at the same instant, and that there are countries where no\r\none born under Aquarius becomes a fisherman or under the Balances a\r\nmoney-changer. The argument employed in this connection, which we\r\ncannot follow in detail, involves such a dubious piece of physics\r\nas that the pyramid of light which gradually spreads from a distant\r\nluminous point exercises the same force on all points lying within its\r\nbase. The astronomers would doubtless retort that the rays of light\r\nfalling perpendicularly and the shortest distance would be stronger and\r\nmore efficacious than the oblique ones, or that pyramids must also be\r\ntaken into account with the point in the object affected and the base\r\nin the constellation. Indeed, Albert in this very section _On fate_\r\nhas previously shown[1968] from the science of perspective and _Liber\r\nde speculis_ that in Ethiopia the sun’s direct ray “reflected upon\r\nitself” produces fire and makes the child born there fiery and black,\r\nwhile near the pole the great obliquity of the incidences of the rays\r\nproduces cold and damp. For such reasons as these I am inclined to\r\nwonder if this supplementary passage, which is not essential to the\r\nplan or main argument of the section _On fate_, has not been added by\r\nsomeone other than Albert. Whoever the author is, he also agrees with\r\nAugustine that, when asked to account for two persons falling sick,\r\ngrowing worse, and recovering at the same times, Hippocrates gave the\r\nbetter answer in saying that they were conceived and born together of\r\nthe same parents, than Posidonius did in saying that they were born\r\nunder the same constellation. For Hippocrates named the immediate\r\ncause, whereas Posidonius mentioned the extrinsic and indirect one, for\r\nthe stars are not a cause, it is again reiterated, except _per aliud\r\net accidens_. But the author, like Albert before, holds that Augustine\r\ndoes not deny that there is some force from the stars inclining though\r\nnot compelling us. This is equivalent to sanctioning astrology.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1692] _Hist.

I,\r\ntract, i_) also ascribed to him.\r\n\r\nIn the notice of CLM 16129, 14th century, fols. 25-112, Alberti Magni\r\ntractatus de passionibus aeris et impressionibus vaporum in alto, de\r\nmineralibus, de imaginibus lapidum et sigillis, de natura metallorum,\r\nit is scarcely clear whether _De imaginibus lapidum et sigillis_ is a\r\nseparate treatise from the _De mineralibus_ or only the portion of it\r\ndealing with astronomical images.\r\n\r\n[1865] III, i, 2.\r\n\r\n[1866] _Mineral_, III, i, 8.\r\n\r\n[1867] _Ibid._, III, i, 9.\r\n\r\n[1868] _Ibid._, III. i, 4.\r\n\r\n[1869] _Vita Alberti_, cap. 16.\r\n\r\n[1870] _Mineral._, III, i, 2.\r\n\r\n[1871] _Mineral._, II, i, 5.\r\n\r\n[1872] _De causis elementorum_, I, ii, 7 (Borgnet, IX, 615).\r\n\r\n[1873] I, 290.\r\n\r\n[1874] Most of them I have not been able to examine or compare; but\r\nwhere the opening and closing words are given in the catalogues, they\r\ndiffer as well as the titles. It is possible, however, that some of\r\nthem may be parts of the other treatises.\r\n\r\n[1875] MS 138, 15th century, fols. 171-83, “Semita recta fratris\r\nAlberti Magni”; fols. 233-5, “Speculum secretorum philosophorum Alberti\r\nMagni de secretis naturae,” opening, “Ad instructionem multorum” and\r\nclosing, “penuriam librorum”; fols. 235-7, “Liber xii aquarum Alberti\r\nMagni,” opening “Ovorum vitella,” and closing, “omne corpus.”\r\n\r\nIn the same library MS 139, 14th century, besides the _Semita recta_\r\nat fols. 3-35--this time Albert is not named as its author--occurs\r\nat fols. 107-21, “Incipit libellus ab Alberto compositus. Quoniam\r\nignorantis ... / ... dum regnat Iupiter.”\r\n\r\nAlso in MS 270, II, 15-16th century, fol. 77, “Alberti Magni Alchymia.\r\nCallixtenes unus philosophorum ... / ... siccum.”\r\n\r\nIn MS 270, X, at fol. 99 the _Speculum secretorum_, etc., is again\r\nascribed to Albert; and in MS 270, XV, fol. 3-, is “Ars experimentorum\r\nAlberti Magni. Sciendum vero ... / ... viscositate malve.”\r\n\r\n[1876] Sloane 323, 14th century, fols. 1-84, “Practica Fratris Alberti\r\nin alchimiam, que ab eodem dicitur sec. sec.” The work is said to have\r\nbeen printed in the _Theatrum Chymicum_, II, 423.\r\n\r\n[1877] _Ibid._, fol. 8r. The previous citation of Albert was at fol. 7v.\r\n\r\n[1878] Arundel 164, written in 1422, fols. 127v-131, “De occultis\r\nnature,” opening, “In mutue allocutionis tractatu,” and closing, “sicut\r\nqui cum arcu sine torta sagutur (sagittur?) deo gratias.”\r\n\r\n[1879] CUL 220, 16th century, occupying two leaves in an alchemical\r\nmiscellany. It opens, “Aqua Mercurius et oleum sulphuris. Opus istud\r\nmultis diebus abscondebatur....”\r\n\r\nPossibly the following are also distinct treatises, but I do not\r\nhave their _Incipits_ and _Explicits_: CLM 12026, 15th century, fol.\r\n32, Alberti de Colonia ars alchymiae; Wolfenbüttel 676, anno 1444,\r\nfollowing the _Semita recta_ at fols. 34-36, Varia Alberti Magni\r\nchymica; Riccard. 119, following the _Semita recta_, which is #32 in\r\nthis miscellany, comes #33, an _Alchimia_ ascribed to Albertus Magnus,\r\nwhile the second treatise bearing #37 (at fol. 177r) is _Alberti quidam\r\nTractatus_.\r\n\r\n[1880] It is included in vol. 21 of the edition of Lyons, 1651, by R.\r\nP. Jammy; and by Borgnet, vol. 37; 545-73, Alberti Magni libellus de\r\nalchimia. It had previously been printed at Basel, 1561, and Urcellis,\r\n1602-1608, _Theatrum chemicum_, pp. 485-527. It is the same as the\r\ntreatise called _Semita recta_ in the MSS. Another MS of it is Corpus\r\nChristi 226, 15th century, fols. 59-69.\r\n\r\n[1881] See Denifle (1886), 236.\r\n\r\n[1882] “Videns ergo tot errare iam decrevi scribere vera et probata\r\nopera et meliora omnium philosophorum in quibus laboravi et sum\r\nexpertus nihil aliud scribam nisi quod oculis meis vidi.” Or perhaps he\r\nmeans that his works are better than those of all the philosophers.\r\n\r\n[1883] “Alchimia est ars ab Alchimo inventa et dicitur ab archymo\r\nGraece quod est massa Latine,” cap. 2.\r\n\r\n[1884] Cap. 3, “Probat artem Alchimiae esse veram.” This done, however,\r\nthe chapter continues with the eight precepts which follow.\r\n\r\n[1885] “domum specialem extra hominum conspectum in qua sint duae\r\ncamerae vel tres in quibus fiant operationes.”\r\n\r\n[1886] Since he had just mentioned “the books of incantations of Hermes\r\nthe philosopher and Costa ben Luca,” he very likely had in mind simply\r\nthe Letter of the latter on Incantation, Adjuration, and Suspension\r\nfrom the Neck, of which we have previously treated, and which Albert\r\nuses for physical ligatures in his treatise on minerals.\r\n\r\n[1887] II, iii, 5.\r\n\r\n[1888] II, iii, 6.\r\n\r\n[1889] XXII, ii, 18.\r\n\r\n[1890] _Mineral._, II, i, 1; _De animalibus_, XXII, i, 5; _De somno et\r\nvigilia_, III, i, 6.\r\n\r\n[1891] I-ii-2.\r\n\r\n[1892] CLM 916, 15th century, fols. 25-30, Chiromantia Alberti: BN\r\n7420A, 14th century, #15, Alberti de Colonia ars chiromantiae.\r\n\r\n[1893] I presume that Vienna MS 2448, 14th century, 26 fols.,\r\n“Expliciunt interpretaciones sompniorum reuerendi domini Magni Alberti\r\nParisiis conscripta” is simply this third book, but perhaps it is some\r\nspurious treatise. MS 1158, 14th century, in the University Library at\r\nBologna, fols. 41-52, catalogued as “Magistri Alberti theotonici de\r\nfato, de divinatione, de sortibus,” consists of the _De fato_ ascribed\r\nto Aquinas; a second treatise _De fato_ which in the MS itself is\r\nheaded in the upper margin of fol. 45r, “Magri (Magistri) Alexandri”; a\r\n“Questio de divinatione Alexandri,” at fol. 47r; and an anonymous _De\r\nsortibus_.\r\n\r\n[1894] Extract from the _Compendium studii theologiae_, quoted at\r\npage 412 of Charles’ Life of Roger Bacon. “Tarde venit aliquid de\r\nphilosophia Aristotelis in usum Latinorum, quia naturalis philosophia\r\neius et metaphysica cum commentariis Averrois et aliorum libris in\r\ntemporibus nostris translatae sunt, et Parisiis excommunicabantur\r\nante annum Domini 1237 propter aeternitatem mundi et temporis, et\r\npropter librum ‘De divinatione somniorum’ qui est tractatus ‘De somno\r\net vigilia,’ et propter multa alia erronea translata.” It is found in\r\nRashdall’s edition of the _Compendium studii theologiae_ at pp. 33-4.\r\n\r\n[1895] III, i, 2.\r\n\r\n[1896] III, i, 1.\r\n\r\n[1897] III, i, 4.\r\n\r\n[1898] III, ii, 5.\r\n\r\n[1899] III, ii, 3-4.\r\n\r\n[1900] III, i, 8-9.\r\n\r\n[1901] III, ii, 6.\r\n\r\n[1902] III, ii, 9.\r\n\r\n[1903] VI, 12.\r\n\r\n[1904] III, i, 10.\r\n\r\n[1905] I have not seen CUL 1705, 14th century, fols. 181v-183,\r\n“Albertus de naturis signorum,” opening, “Deus utitur corporibus\r\ncelestibus” and closing “Saturnus enim tenebras significat.” It is not\r\nincluded in Albert’s printed works and is perhaps not by him.\r\n\r\n[1906] See chapter 62 below for bibliography.\r\n\r\n[1907] In his _Siger de Brabant et l’averroisme latin au XIIIe siècle,\r\ndeuxième édition revue et augmentée_, Louvain, 1911, I, 244-48; and\r\nmore fully in an article, “Roger Bacon et le ‘Speculum astronomiae,’”\r\nin the _Revue Néo-Scolastique_, vol. 17, August, 1910.\r\n\r\n[1908] Theophilus Witzel in an otherwise excellent article on\r\nRoger Bacon in the _Catholic Encyclopedia_; A.

The closest approach to the\r\npassage that I have found in Galen occurs in the _De foetuum\r\nformatione_ (Kühn, IV, 700-701) where Galen mentions approvingly the\r\ntheory of some Platonic masters that the world-soul is responsible for\r\nthe marvelous process of the formation of the foetus, but adds that\r\nhe regards it as impious and unfitting to ascribe the generation or\r\nformation of scorpions, spiders, flies, fleas, worms, vipers, and the\r\nlike to the soul of the cosmos.\r\n\r\n[1947] _Mineral._, II, iii, 3.\r\n\r\n[1948] _De coelo et mundo_, II, iii, 5.\r\n\r\n[1949] _De animal._, XXII, i, 3.\r\n\r\n[1950] _Mineral._, II, iii, 3. “Est autem principium in ipsa scientia\r\nomnia quaecunque fiunt a natura vel arte moveri a virtutibus\r\ncoelestibus primo; et hic de natura non est dubium.

D. Prümmer began in 1911 to publish the\r\n sources, when he edited the hitherto unprinted biography by\r\n Peter Calo who wrote about 1300: _Fontes Vitae S. Thomae\r\n Aquinatis notis historicis et criticis illustrati_, Fasc. I,\r\n Toulouse, 1911. Peter Calo seems to have admitted a great\r\n deal of legendary material. D. J. Kennedy’s “Thomas Aquinas”\r\n in CE profits by this publication and contains perhaps\r\n as good a brief sketch of Aquinas’ career as there is in\r\n English. It also has a good bibliography. It is, however,\r\n at variance on some points with Thomas of Cantimpré’s\r\n statements, as I have indicated in the text.\r\n\r\n On the bibliography of Aquinas’ own works one may consult:\r\n C. U. J. Chevalier, _Catalogue critique des œuvres de Saint\r\n Thomas d’Aquin_, 1887; A. Miola, _Codices MSS operum S.\r\n Thomae de Aquino et S. Bonaventurae in Regia Neapolitana\r\n Bibliotheca_, 1874; P. Mandonnet, _Des Écrits Authentiques\r\n de S. Thomas d’Aquin_, Fribourg, 1910. Latest and fullest,\r\n but still leaving much to be desired despite its 252 pages,\r\n is A. Michelitsch, _Thomasschriften_, 1913, vol. I; which\r\n gives the sources for Aquinas’ biography but too briefly\r\n with arbitrary omissions, the bare numbers of MSS containing\r\n his works without indication of their date or contents,\r\n the old lists of his writings, and a full analysis of the\r\n printed editions. Fossi (1793-1795) II, 663-98, lists\r\n such of Aquinas’ works printed before 1500 as are in the\r\n Magliabechian library at Florence.\r\n\r\n Since the edition of the works of Aquinas begun by order of\r\n Pope Leo XIII at Rome, 1886-1906, has never been completed,\r\n the most useful edition and that which I have employed\r\n remains that by E. Fretté and P. Maré, _Opera omnia_, Paris,\r\n 1871-1880, in 34 volumes.\r\n\r\n I have not been much impressed by the worth of such\r\n secondary works on Aquinas and his science as I have\r\n happened upon: for some bibliography see Paetow (1917),\r\n pp. 406, 408-9. Paetow does not mention A. Farges, _Études\r\n philosophiques pour vulgariser les théories d’Aristote et\r\n de S. Thomas et montrer leur accord avec les sciences_,\r\n 1909; A. Fisichella, _S. Tommaso d’Aquino, Leone XIII e\r\n la scienza_, 1880; T. Gaudenzi, _S. Tommaso d’Aquino e\r\n la scienza_. 1874; Frohschammer, _Die Philosophie des\r\n Thomas von Aquino_, Leipzig, 1889; nor G. M. Cornoldi\r\n (1822-1892), _The Physical System of St. Thomas_, English\r\n translation by E. H. Dering, London, 1893. The last is a\r\n Roman Catholic defense of the natural philosophy of Aquinas\r\n against modern science, which obscures the facts that Thomas\r\n held fast to the theory of four elements and derived his\r\n natural philosophy from Aristotle. Overworked as the words\r\n “camouflage” and “propaganda” are, one is tempted to apply\r\n them in the case of recent Aquinas literature. At the same\r\n time it is remarkable how few libraries have a complete\r\n and unexpurgated edition of his works. I have not seen\r\n F. Tessen-Wesierski, _Die Grundlagen des Wunderbegriffes\r\n nach Thomas von Aquino_, 1899, in _Jahrb. f. Philos, u.\r\n Spekulative Theologie_.\r\n\r\n The relation of Aquinas to Dante has been the theme of more\r\n than one work; an example is N. Busetto, _Saggi di varia\r\n Psicologia Dantesca contribute allo studio delle relazioni\r\n di Dante con Alberto Magno e con San Tommaso_, 1905.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Precociousness of Aquinas.]\r\n\r\nThomas Aquinas was perhaps not so precocious a genius as some of his\r\nfellow-countrymen who were artists during the Italian Renaissance.\r\nBut if he did not die quite as young as Masaccio or Raphael, he\r\nnevertheless produced a vast amount of learned writing within a\r\ncomparatively short time. Whether we believe that he was born in 1225\r\nor 1227, he was not yet fifty when he died on the seventh of March,\r\n1274. Ptolemy of Lucca, who states that he had often heard Aquinas’\r\nconfession and had attended his lectures and been his friend for a\r\nlong time,[1969] says that Thomas became a Dominican at sixteen and\r\n“lived in pure innocence” for about thirty-two years thereafter.[1970]\r\nA passage in the _Compendium studii philosophiae_ of Roger Bacon sneers\r\nat the theological teaching of “the boys of the two Orders,” such as\r\nAlbert and Thomas and the others who enter the Orders when twenty\r\nyears or under.[1971] Perhaps the names of Albert and Thomas were not\r\nin the passage as originally penned by Bacon; Albert at least had\r\nprobably come of age before the friar orders started, and Bacon would\r\nscarcely look back upon a man who was his senior as a boy. But the fact\r\nremains that Thomas at least became a Dominican at an early age.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Early life according to Thomas of Cantimpré.]\r\n\r\nThomas of Cantimpré tells[1972] how Aquinas entered the Dominican order\r\nat Bologna against the wishes of his family--he was the son of the\r\ncount of Aquino and the countess of Teano--who secured a summons to the\r\npapal court where he was ordered to put off the friar’s dress and be\r\ninvested with ecclesiastical office. When he refused, his two brothers\r\nsecretly seized him and shut him up in prison where he suffered from\r\nwant, cold, and poverty, and further from women whom his brothers\r\nintroduced to tempt him. He remained thus imprisoned “for two or three\r\nyears” according to Thomas of Cantimpré, until master John of the\r\nDominicans complained to the emperor Frederick II who secured Aquinas’\r\nrelease and would, according to Thomas of Cantimpré, have put his\r\nbrothers to death for their inhumanity but for master John’s further\r\nintervention. Master John then shipped Aquinas off to Paris, but his\r\nbrothers and friends at the papal court had him again summoned thither,\r\nand he was offered the post of abbot of Monte Cassino “under whom are\r\nseven bishops and who himself exercises the pontifical office.” The\r\npope was ready to allow him to continue to wear the Dominican costume\r\nin this position, but Aquinas fled a second time from the papal court\r\nand came to Cologne and studied there until Albert was transferred\r\nto Paris and given the chair of theology there for his incomparable\r\nlearning. “After whom,” continues Cantimpré, “also this same brother\r\nThomas gained a position and chair of similar importance.” The meaning\r\nof this last sentence is somewhat doubtful. Is “after” used in the\r\nsense of time or of precedence in dignity? Did Aquinas hold a position\r\nat the same time with and second only to Albert, or did he obtain\r\nthe chair only after Albert had ceased to hold it? Chronological\r\nconsiderations make the latter more probable. But was the chair in\r\nquestion at Cologne or at Paris?\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Is Thomas of Cantimpré’s account reliable?]\r\n\r\nThis passage from Thomas of Cantimpré is at variance on a number of\r\npoints with the accounts usually given of Aquinas’ life. For instance,\r\nit makes him join the Dominicans at Bologna, not at Naples, and\r\nrepresents the pope as siding with his family in their efforts to keep\r\nAquinas out of the Dominican Order instead of delivering Aquinas from\r\nthe persecution of his family. But Thomas of Cantimpré apparently\r\npenned his passage during Aquinas’ lifetime and it is probably a half\r\ncentury nearer the events than the _Lives_ of Aquinas written in the\r\nearly fourteenth century and upon which most modern accounts are based.\r\nAt the same time it must be admitted that Cantimpré seems to write in\r\na loose and exaggerated manner which does not command much confidence.\r\nBut I suspect that he is the ultimate source of most of the later\r\naccounts covering the same ground.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ptolemy of Lucca on his early life.]\r\n\r\nPtolemy of Lucca, who may be regarded as an independent witness in\r\nview of his personal friendship with Aquinas, states that Thomas was\r\nof noble origin and descended from great counts of the kingdom of\r\nApulia, that his family were faithful to the pope against the emperor\r\nFrederick II, and that Thomas was educated as a boy in the monastery of\r\nMonte Cassino. When he joined the Dominicans at sixteen, his relations\r\nkidnapped him, but he escaped to Rome and from there went off to\r\nCologne to become Albert’s pupil. At the age of twenty-five he came to\r\nParis where before his thirtieth year he lectured on the _Sentences_\r\nand received his degree in theology. Before receiving the degree he\r\nhad written a commentary on the _Sentences_ and a treatise against\r\nWilliam of St. Amour. As William of St. Amour was not condemned by the\r\npope until October, 1256, and as the friars were not admitted to the\r\ndoctorate in theology at Paris until 1257 or 1258, Ptolemy’s statements\r\nwould indicate that Thomas was not born until 1227.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Date and place of his studies with Albert.]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the assertions of both Cantimpré and Ptolemy of\r\nLucca that Aquinas studied with Albert at Cologne before Albert was\r\ncalled to Paris, do not fit in any too well with the usual dating\r\nof Albert’s Paris residence as from 1245 to 1248, when he is again\r\nsupposed to have returned to Cologne. Consequently Peter of Prussia in\r\nhis fifteenth century life of Albertus Magnus held that Aquinas spent\r\ntwo periods of study with Albert at Cologne, one before and the other\r\nafter Albert’s teaching at Paris.[1973] Similarly von Hertling[1974]\r\ngives 1245-1252 as the duration of Aquinas’ studies with Albert, after\r\nwhich he returned to Paris alone.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: His closing years.]\r\n\r\nOnly sixteen or seventeen years of life remained to Aquinas after\r\nhe received his degree in theology. Ptolemy of Lucca states that he\r\nremained in Paris for only three years after receiving the degree,\r\nwhen he returned to Italy, where during the pontificates of Urban IV\r\n(1261-1264) and Clement IV (1265-1268) he resided at Viterbo, Orvieto,\r\nand Rome, and was offered but declined the archbishopric of Naples.\r\nDuring these same years Ptolemy places most of his chief works. In 1268\r\nor 1269 he returned to Paris, but died in Italy in 1274.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: His success as a theologian.]\r\n\r\nAquinas rapidly attained great success as a teacher and authority as a\r\ntheologian during his lifetime and seems still to be regarded as the\r\ngreatest and most authoritative of the orthodox medieval theologians.\r\nThis success was probably due to the fact that he did just a little\r\nbetter than anyone else what a great many had been and were trying to\r\ndo, and that was to combine all previous Christian thinking into one\r\nsystematic and consistent and moderate whole. Aquinas was probably not\r\nthe most brilliant or original mind of his generation, but probably\r\nhis teaching and writing were clearer to a greater number of students,\r\nand seemed sounder to a greater number of the thinkers of the time\r\nthan the lectures or books of any other contemporary. He put matters\r\nclearly, concisely, moderately, and convincingly; and struck the golden\r\nmean as it were. We can see how he may have profited immensely by the\r\nwork of predecessors like William of Auvergne and Albertus Magnus, and\r\nyet how his works would tend to supplant theirs. Moreover, the task\r\nat which he had been working was not one which admitted of infinite\r\nimprovement. It was largely a problem of combining, classifying,\r\nreconciling, and presenting the views of previous generations and\r\nperiods, and when this was once well done, there was no need of\r\ndoing it again. The attitude therefore of Aquinas toward magic and\r\nwitchcraft, astrology and divination, and other occult arts and\r\nsciences, and also toward natural science is quite important for us to\r\nnote, since he summed up previous Christian thought so satisfactorily,\r\nsince he was both the most popular and the most moderate teacher of\r\nhis own time, and since his opinions upon these subjects remained\r\nfor centuries acceptable and authoritative to the Roman Catholic\r\nChurch.[1975] At the same time for these very reasons we must not\r\nexpect to find him putting forward any new and unusual views upon these\r\npoints.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: His commentaries on Aristotle.]\r\n\r\nAquinas was not merely a theologian in a narrow and restricted sense\r\nof that word, but was also noted as a commentator on Aristotle.[1976]\r\nPtolemy of Lucca tells us that “he expounded practically all\r\nphilosophy, whether moral or natural, but especially ethics and\r\nmathematics.” These lectures, however, were not all published. Thomas\r\ndid not comment on as many of the Aristotelian works as Albert did, and\r\nseveral of his commentaries were left unfinished and were completed\r\nby others such as Peter of Auvergne. Thomas has sometimes been given\r\ncredit for bringing about and using as the basis of his commentaries\r\na new translation of Aristotle, made directly from the Greek and\r\npresumably executed by William of Moerbeke,[1977] although, as we have\r\nalready noted in the case of Peter of Prussia’s _Life of Albertus\r\nMagnus_, some say by Thomas of Cantimpré. It is true that William\r\nof Moerbeke translated some of the works of Aristotle, but I cannot\r\nfind that anyone has ever identified a signed translation by him with\r\nthe text used by Aquinas or otherwise adequately demonstrated that\r\nthey worked in concert.[1978] Even if Aquinas instigated William’s\r\ntranslations from Aristotle, he could not have taken full advantage of\r\nthem, since some of William’s work of translation was executed after\r\nAquinas’ death.[1979]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The spheres of theology and science.]\r\n\r\nWe must not think of Aquinas’ studies in secular philosophy and science\r\nas simply aimed to render these subjects serviceable and innocuous to\r\nChristian theology. He was too much a student of Albertus Magnus for\r\nthat, and his study of Greek thought and natural science broadened\r\nhis outlook beyond that of theology in a narrow sense. He believed,\r\nmoreover, that to a large extent the fields of theology and natural\r\nscience were distinct; that pure theologians should not try to settle\r\npurely philosophical or scientific problems, of which they knew little.\r\nChristians who deny as contrary to their faith the philosophical\r\nsolutions of problems which are really indifferent so far as the Faith\r\nis concerned, simply bring Christianity, in Aquinas’ opinion, into\r\ndisrepute among the wise men of this world.[1980] Conversely every\r\ntheory of an ancient philosopher or hypothesis of science is not to be\r\naccepted as of equal rank with religious dogmas. When John of Vercelli\r\nsubmitted a list of questions upon which he desired, first, the\r\nopinions of the saints, and secondly, the opinion of Aquinas himself,\r\nThomas protested at the start that some of the inquiries had nothing to\r\ndo with the Christian faith but were purely physical.[1981]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Aquinas as a scientist.]\r\n\r\nFurthermore we must keep in mind that Aquinas was something of a\r\nscientist himself. It is interesting to note that after his death the\r\nUniversity of Paris wrote to the general chapter of the Dominicans,\r\nnot only lamenting his death as an irreparable loss and asking that\r\nhis bones might be sent to Paris for burial, but also requesting the\r\ntransmission of certain books begun by him while at the university\r\nand not as yet completed upon his departure from Paris.[1982] What\r\nwere these writings: theological treatises, commentaries on the minor\r\nprophets, or manuals of devotion? None of these. They were a commentary\r\non the philosopher Simplicius, another on the _De coelo et mundo_ of\r\nAristotle,[1983] a third on the _Timaeus_ of Plato, and finally a work\r\non irrigation and mechanical engineering.[1984]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Inferior to Albert.]\r\n\r\nThomas, however, did no such important work in natural science as\r\nAlbert. His commentaries upon Aristotle follow the text closely\r\nand do little more than expound it; they are not full of long\r\ndigressions and additions, as Albert’s are. Thomas did not found an\r\nexperimental school and had not himself devoted the long years of\r\npersonal experience and observation to nature that his master had.\r\nAnd he seems to have had the less original and observant mind of\r\nthe two. But his wide reading, his clear thinking, his well-ordered\r\nclass-room presentation of material and arguments, and his broad yet\r\nmoderate views insured his instant and permanent success in the field\r\nof theology, where the paths were already well trod, and it only\r\nremained for someone to put everything into as perfect and final a\r\nform as possible. In natural science, on the other hand, the labor\r\nthat awaited men was not merely the lucid combination of Aristotelian\r\nand Arabic thinking with previous Christian thought, but the pioneer\r\nwork of personal observation and experiment and the far more difficult\r\ncombination of these with existing theories. Aquinas was a perfecter\r\naccording to the standards of his own age; Albert sometimes was a\r\npioneer in the spirit of the new age of science.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Aquinas’ theological approach to the subject of magic.]\r\n\r\nIn view of this distinction between the two men it is perhaps not\r\nsurprising that what Aquinas has to say concerning magic, even in the\r\nbroad use of that term, occurs to a large extent in his theological\r\nwritings. Just as, although Albert was a distinguished theologian,\r\nwe viewed magic in his works largely as connected with science; so,\r\nalthough Aquinas studied and wrote of secular philosophy and science,\r\nwe find in him a moderate, enlightened, and highly influential\r\nstatement of the attitude of Christian theological scholarship towards\r\nmagic, witchcraft, and astrology. In his account of magic so-called\r\nin his _Summa_, _Contra Gentiles_, and _De potentia_, he seems to\r\nfollow Augustine a good deal, and like him he makes considerable use of\r\nPorphyry’s _Letter to Anebo_. Aquinas accepts the essential features\r\nof the previous theological definition of magic, as Albert did in his\r\n_theological_ treatises.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Miracle distinguished.]\r\n\r\nAquinas carefully distinguishes magic from miracle.[1985] A miracle\r\nis contrary to the order of all created nature and can be performed by\r\nGod alone. Many things that seem marvelous to us or of which the cause\r\nis hidden from us are not, strictly speaking, miraculous. An eclipse\r\nseems a miracle to some ignorant people, but not to a philosopher who\r\nunderstands its cause. Other seeming marvels which are not divine\r\nmiracles are the occult virtues of physical bodies “for which a\r\nreason cannot be assigned by man,”[1986] and the effects produced in\r\nour lower world by the influence of the constellations. Even more\r\ndifficult of human comprehension are the doings of demons, who, Aquinas\r\nis convinced, can not only deceive the senses and affect the human\r\nimagination, but also truly transform bodies. Yet even their feats are\r\nnot true miracles in violation of natural order; they simply add to the\r\nmarvelous virtues of physical objects and the potent influences of the\r\nstars something of their own peculiar powers. After all, their feats\r\ncan be explained, they operate by means of art; God alone is a cause\r\nabsolutely hidden from every man.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Reality of magic affirmed.]\r\n\r\nAs for magicians, in their feats they make use of herbs and other\r\nphysical bodies: of words, usually in the form of “invocations,\r\nsupplications, and adjurations”; they also employ figures and\r\ncharacters, sacrifices and prostrations, images and rites, carefully\r\nobserved times, constellations, and other considerations.[1987] As a\r\nresult the whereabouts of stolen objects is disclosed, hidden treasure\r\nis found, the future is revealed, closed doors mysteriously open,\r\nmen become invisible, inanimate bodies move and speak, apparitions\r\nof rational beings are summoned and answer questions. Some contend\r\nthat such apparitions are imaginary, but Aquinas replies that on such\r\noccasions third parties have been present whose senses were working\r\nnormally and who also witnessed the apparitions, and furthermore\r\nthat no phantom of our imagination could reveal things of which we\r\nourselves were ignorant. In the reality of such feats of magic, then,\r\nThomas firmly believes.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Magic not a science but due to demons.]\r\n\r\nBut Aquinas will not admit that the magician and his materials are a\r\nsufficient cause of the magic. He also denies that certain men are\r\nespecially endowed with magic power by the stars at their birth or\r\nthat the influence of the constellations can be controlled to perform\r\nparticular feats of magic. Demons in his opinion really perform the\r\nmagic. Words, figures, spells are mere signs to them; the poor magician\r\nis their dupe. It looks, Thomas admits, as if spirits came only when\r\ninvoked, and as if they often came unwillingly, and sometimes performed\r\ngood deeds at the magician’s bidding which must be very distasteful\r\nto them as evil beings. But in all this they are simply deceiving\r\nmankind. “It is not true then,” says Aquinas, “that the magic arts are\r\nsciences, but rather they are certain fallacies of the demons.”[1988]\r\nIn discussing the “notory art,” which professes to acquire knowledge by\r\nfasting, prayers to God, figures, and strange words, he declares that\r\ndemons cannot illuminate the intellect, although they may express in\r\nwords some smattering of the sciences.[1989]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: And is evil.]\r\n\r\nAquinas further charges that the practitioners of magic are generally\r\ncriminals, perpetrating illicit deeds, adulteries, thefts, and\r\nhomicides, a fact which has gained for magicians the further name of\r\nevil-doers, i. e. _malefici_ (sorcerers). At best magic does not aid\r\nman in science or virtue, but in trivial matters such as the discovery\r\nof stolen goods.[1990] Aquinas repeats the criticism of Porphyry in\r\n_The Letter to Anebo_ that the methods of magic are immoral. Therefore\r\nit is wrong to seek to learn “the magic sciences” in order to use them,\r\nbut permissible to study them in order to confute them. Aquinas then\r\nmakes haste to correct this phrase “magic sciences,” as we have already\r\nnoted above.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Some regard magic as a human art or science.]\r\n\r\nBut by his own denial Aquinas makes it sufficiently evident that many\r\nmen of his time thought the magic arts sciences, and that magicians\r\nbelieved themselves able by personal qualifications, by subtle use of\r\noccult natural properties, by rites and ceremonies, and by the art of\r\nastrology, either to work wonders directly and immediately or to coerce\r\ndemons to work wonders for them.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Aquinas believes in witchcraft.]\r\n\r\nIn lending the authority of his name to an affirmation of the reality\r\nof demon-magic, Aquinas must share together with many writers\r\nbefore and after him responsibility for the witchcraft delusion and\r\nexecutions. And yet he tells us that there were already some persons by\r\nhis time who denied that there was any such thing as witchcraft except\r\nin men’s imaginations and fears. Such persons argued that where the\r\nsupposed sorcery was not entirely due to imaginary terror, it could\r\nbe explained as the natural effect of occult causes. But Aquinas, who\r\ntwice argues the question whether the consummation of marriage can be\r\nprevented by sorcery,[1991] declares that the authority of the saints\r\nand of the Catholic faith alike proclaim the reality of witchcraft\r\nand its power to obstruct carnal union. Men who dispute this are the\r\nsame as denying the existence of the demons.[1992] Dear demons! What a\r\ntreasured legacy of theology from paganism!\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Divination.]\r\n\r\nAquinas also tends to follow ecclesiastical tradition in condemning\r\nmost arts of divination as the work of demons,[1993] and in carefully\r\ndistinguishing from them divine prophecy, which can speak with\r\ncertainty even of contingent matters.[1994] He grants, however,\r\nthat some arts of divination have a natural basis, and that natural\r\ndivination is permissible, if not extended to accidental occurrences\r\nand to human acts due to the reason and will.[1995] It is possible to\r\nforecast the future by interpretation of dreams which are produced\r\nby natural causes either within or outside the sleeper’s body.[1996]\r\nThe commentary of Aquinas on Aristotle’s _De somno et vigilia_ is,\r\nhowever, a perfunctory treatise, inferior to that by Albertus Magnus on\r\nthe same theme, and advances no ideas of Thomas’ own on the subject of\r\ndivination from dreams. Even augury may be natural divination, if the\r\nacts of the animals under observation are governed by the positions and\r\nmovements of the stars.[1997] Aquinas also mentions chiromancy without\r\ndisapproval, but will not admit that geomancy comes under the head\r\nof natural divination, since the figures upon which its predictions\r\nare based are the outcome either of chance or of voluntary human\r\naction.[1998] He condemns as superstitious the regarding as signs of\r\nthe future such trivial occurrences as a sneeze or a dog’s running\r\nbetween two persons who are walking together.[1999]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Lot casting.]\r\n\r\nLot casting of whatever sort is not natural divination. The Bible\r\ntells us, however, that God often rules the casting of lots, and “if\r\npractices which have a natural or human cause are blameless, much more\r\nso are those which depend on divine aid.”[2000] But Aquinas cautions\r\nagainst an appeal to God to decide the casting of lots unless there is\r\nreal necessity, or without due reverence and devotion, or for purely\r\nhuman and worldly purposes, or in cases where direct divine inspiration\r\nshould be sought, as in ecclesiastical elections. As Bede pointed out,\r\nit is true that Matthias was selected by lot before Pentecost, but\r\nafter the reception of the Holy Ghost the seven deacons were elected\r\nby the disciples. And when men pry into hidden things more than they\r\nshould, whether by lot casting or other methods, it is Aquinas’ opinion\r\nthat demons are involved.[2001]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Occult virtues.]\r\n\r\nAs Aquinas differentiated between natural divination and that due to\r\ndemons, so he distinguishes from illicit magic “the occult works of\r\nnature.” On this theme he addressed a brief treatise to “a certain\r\nknight.”[2002] Besides those properties of natural objects which\r\naccord with the properties of their component elements and so have a\r\nmanifest origin, there are occult virtues for which men can give no\r\nreason,[2003] as in the stock illustration of the magnet, as great a\r\nfavorite with medieval writers as electricity is with modern preachers\r\nto inspire faith in the invisible and imperfectly known. Aquinas\r\naccounts for the existence of such occult virtues by the influence of\r\nthe heavenly bodies upon the world of nature. In his _Meteorology_,\r\ntoo, he attributes the wonderful powers of precious stones to “a\r\ncertain celestial and occult virtue.”[2004] In this he probably shows\r\nthe influence of his master Albertus Magnus.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Alchemy and fascination.]\r\n\r\nAquinas declares that alchemy is a true, although difficult art, and\r\naccounts for the efficacy of its operations by its utilization of\r\noccult forces of celestial virtue.[2005] Pico della Mirandola noted\r\nthat while Thomas seemed to deny the art in his _Commentary on the\r\nSentences_, he approved it in his theological _Summa_, which Pico\r\naccepted as his last word on the subject.[2006] Spurious works of\r\nalchemy were, however, subsequently ascribed to Aquinas in manuscripts\r\nof the fifteenth century. Fascination Aquinas also regards as a fact,\r\nand practically explains it as due to the power of the evil eye. The\r\neye is affected by the strong imagination of the soul and then corrupts\r\nand poisons the atmosphere so that tender bodies coming within its\r\nrange may be injuriously affected. It is thus that malicious old women\r\ninjure children,[2007]--another faggot added by Aquinas to the pyres of\r\nthe witchcraft delusion.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Amulets and incantations.]\r\n\r\nWe have hitherto found the practices of wearing amulets and repeating\r\nincantations apt to accompany the belief in occult virtues. Aquinas,\r\nin discussing “the suspension of sacred words about the neck” cautions\r\nthat “in all incantations and suspensions of writings” what is written\r\nshould be seemly, should not be an invocation of demons, should contain\r\nno unknown words which may have an evil meaning, and should contain no\r\ncharacters other than the sign of the cross. He quotes the decretal\r\nforbidding other observances in collecting medicinal herbs than the\r\nsign of the cross and repetition of the Lord’s prayer. And he concludes\r\nthat “suspending divine words about the neck, assuming that they\r\ncontain nothing false or doubtful, is certainly permissible, but it\r\nwould be more laudable to abstain from such practices.”[2008]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Attitude to astrology.]\r\n\r\nAlready a number of passages have shown incidentally that Thomas, like\r\nhis master Albert, ascribed an important place in natural science to\r\nastrological theory. Although he refused to explain magic as worked\r\nby the stars, he accounted for the occult works of nature and for\r\nnatural divination by astral influence. He grants the nobility and\r\nincorruptibility of the heavenly bodies but, although aware that Plato\r\nand Aristotle attributed souls and intelligences to them, insists\r\nthat they are material substances. But he regards the stars as\r\n_media_ between “the separate intelligences” and our material world\r\nand is inclined to answer affirmatively a question which was more\r\nthan once put to him, namely, Do the angels move the stars?[2009] He\r\nalso frequently affirms, both in the course of his chief works and in\r\nbriefer answers to special inquiries that God rules inferior through\r\nsuperior creatures and earthly bodies by the stars.[2010] No wise man\r\ndoubts that all natural motions of inferior bodies are caused by the\r\nmovement of the celestial bodies.[2011] Reason and experience, saints\r\nand philosophers, have proved it over and over again. Aquinas then\r\ncites two passages from Augustine[2012] and Dionysius[2013] which do\r\nnot seem so sweeping as his own assertion: Augustine affirming merely\r\nthat “grosser and inferior bodies are ruled by subtler and superior\r\nones according to a certain order,” and Dionysius saying simply that\r\nthe rays of the sun aid in the generation of life and nourish and\r\nincrease and perfect it. Indeed, throughout his arguments for astrology\r\nAquinas, like Albert, seems to stretch authorities upon a Procrustean\r\nbed of citation and to make church fathers who are famed for their\r\nattacks on astrologers seem to favor the limited rule of the stars\r\nover all nature. Aquinas further deems an art of judicial astrology\r\npossible, asserting that, besides the crude prognostications which\r\nsailors and farmers make from the sky, it is feasible “by some other\r\nmore occult observations of the stars to employ judicial astrology\r\nconcerning corporeal effects.”[2014]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Extent of and limits to the influence of the stars upon man.]\r\n\r\nBut Aquinas declares that the human will is free and that the soul as\r\nan intellectual substance cannot be coerced by corporeal substances,\r\nhowever superior. He also opines that many occurrences are accidental\r\nrather than due to the stars, “as when a man digging a grave finds\r\nburied treasure.”[2015] And “no natural agent can incline one to\r\nthat which happens accidentally.” Aquinas like Albert is also aware,\r\nhowever, that the astrologers themselves agree that the wise man rules\r\nthe stars, and conversely he himself recognizes that man is not purely\r\nan intellectual being, that he often obeys sensual appetite, and that\r\neven the mind derives its knowledge from the senses and consequently\r\nin a condition disturbed by phantasy. Thus the stars may indirectly\r\naffect the human intellect to a considerable extent.[2016] Aquinas is\r\nalso ready to admit that astrologers often make true predictions in\r\nevents where large numbers of men are concerned and the passions of the\r\nmajority override the wisdom and will of the few who are able to resist\r\nsuch impulses. On the other hand, he holds that astrologers often err\r\nin their predictions concerning individuals.[2017] This perhaps refers\r\nonly to prediction of nativities, for Peter of Prussia, in defending\r\nAlbertus Magnus against the charge of indulgence in too curious arts,\r\nasserted that Aquinas “nowhere in his writings” reproved or attacked\r\nastrological interrogations.[2018]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Power of astrological images denied.]\r\n\r\nThe question remains, to what extent can men voluntarily avail\r\nthemselves of the celestial virtues? Aquinas takes the position that\r\nmen can make use of such virtues only as they find them already\r\nexisting in nature and that works of human art, as distinct from\r\nnatural objects, receive no new virtue from the stars but only from the\r\nhuman operator,--“from the conception of the artificer.” It is for this\r\nreason that Aquinas refuses to explain many operations of magicians\r\nas produced by the aid of the constellations. In particular he denies\r\nthat gems engraved with astronomical figures receive any more virtue\r\nfrom the stars than other gems of the same species without the carving.\r\nFigures and characters and human words are immaterial and do not\r\nexert force upon matter. If, therefore, astronomical or necromantic\r\nor magic images and characters seem to produce marvelous effects, it\r\nmust be because they are illicitly employed as secret signs to demons\r\nwho really achieve the results.[2019] In short, Aquinas’ position\r\nconcerning images and characters is that of William of Auvergne rather\r\nthan that of Albertus Magnus.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Magi and the star.]\r\n\r\nAquinas discusses the problem of the star of Bethlehem both in his\r\n_Commentary on Matthew_[2020] and in the _Summa_,[2021] and the\r\ninterest which such subjects had for his contemporaries is further\r\nshown by these questions which were put to him, “Did the little hands\r\nof the infant Jesus create stars?” and “Did the star which appeared\r\nto the Magi have the shape of a cross or human form?”[2022] The\r\nfirst question was probably suggested by the apocryphal gospels, the\r\nsecond by the homily of the Pseudo-Chrysostom which we have already\r\nconsidered. Aquinas’ discussion of the star and Magi is somewhat\r\nfuller than that by Abelard but equally drawn from the fathers,\r\nespecially Chrysostom and Augustine.[2023] Like them he contends\r\nthat the incident lends no support to the doctrine of nativities. He\r\nsaves the Magi, however, from the imputation of being workers of magic\r\nand dupes of the demons, adopting Jerome’s oft-repeated explanation\r\nthat while in common speech _magi_ are the same as enchanters, in the\r\nPersian language the word designates philosophers and sages. In this\r\ncase Aquinas does not force his authorities at all; on the contrary\r\nhe makes no attempt to improve upon their captious, sophistical, and\r\nunconvincing arguments.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Is the _De fato_ spurious?]\r\n\r\nThe earliest bibliography of Aquinas’ works seems to be that which\r\nPtolemy of Lucca, who had known him personally, gives in his\r\n_Ecclesiastical History_.[2024] Among the _Opuscula_, which Ptolemy\r\nlists with considerable care, giving their _Incipits_ as well as their\r\ntitles, appears the treatise _De fato_.[2025] It also appears in the\r\n_Table of writings of the Order of Preachers_, a bibliography completed\r\nin the second quarter of the fourteenth century.[2026] It is not,\r\nhowever, in the official list of Thomas’ works drawn up preliminary\r\nto his canonization in 1323, and which Father Mandonnet would accept\r\nas an absolute criterion of the authentic writings of Aquinas. Other\r\nearly catalogues of Aquinas’ writings are all derived from one of these\r\nthree prototypes.[2027] Our treatise has also been attributed to\r\nAlbertus Magnus,[2028] and much of its attitude toward astrology and\r\nother occult arts is just the opposite of Thomas’ position elsewhere as\r\nwe have already noted it. I have therefore reserved the _De fato_ for\r\nseparate consideration. This problem of “fate” also sometimes formed\r\nthe subject of a section of theological _Summae_ or other long works,\r\nas we have seen in the case of Albertus Magnus, and the manuscripts\r\ncontain other separate discussions of it[2029] than this one associated\r\nwith Aquinas. As might be expected there is a general resemblance\r\nbetween the aspects of the problem considered and the authorities cited\r\nin all these treatises. No doubt it was a common topic of scholastic\r\ndisputation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fate and the stars.]\r\n\r\nFate is defined in our treatise as the power of the stars exercised\r\nthrough their movements and relations to one another. After citing\r\nin typical scholastic fashion a number of authorities _pro_ and\r\n_con_,--Aristotle and Boethius are made to supply many arguments for\r\nastrology; and after agreeing with most of the favoring arguments and\r\nanswering some of the opposing ones, the author finally concludes\r\nthat fate in this sense does prevail. But he distinguishes between\r\nfate and fatal necessity, holding that the stars do not impose fatal\r\nnecessity upon inferiors. While their own motion is “necessary,\r\ninevitable, and inalterable, ... in things generated it is received\r\nmutably and contingently because of their changeable natures.” Like\r\nAquinas and other authors, he then approvingly quotes Ptolemy’s\r\nfamiliar qualification that the stars exert their influence _per aliud\r\net per accidens_ and that “the wise man rules the stars.” Properties\r\nof inferior objects may be used by man to counteract the effects of\r\nthe constellations, or imaginations of the mind may operate to weaken\r\ntheir force. The author then argues that fate as he has defined it is\r\nknowable, in other words that the art of astrology is practicable, that\r\nthe influence of the stars can be discerned and measured. He goes so\r\nfar as to defend the assertion of Ptolemy that “when the luminaries are\r\nin the head of Algon, that is, of the Gorgon, if Mars shines in hostile\r\naspect, the child then born will be mutilated of hands and feet, and\r\ncrucified.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Contradictions between _De fato_ and other works of Aquinas.]\r\n\r\nThe _De fato_ seems at variance with the opinions of Aquinas as\r\nexpressed elsewhere upon the following points. It correctly cites\r\nBoethius’ _De consolatione philosophiae_ that the incident of finding\r\nhidden treasure while digging a grave is an example of “the inevitable\r\nconnection of causes which proceeds from the fount of the knowledge\r\nof God,” whereas Aquinas incorrectly cited it as an illustration of\r\nan accidental event. Again, the author of _De fato_ regards the story\r\nof the Magi and the star of Bethlehem as an evidence of the truth of\r\nastrology. He also seems to believe that “intelligence through the\r\nmotion of the sky rules and causes the intellectual operations of\r\nthe soul,” which Aquinas refused to concede. _De fato_ also explains\r\nfascination somewhat differently from Aquinas. It appears to agree with\r\nhim that the soul of the person exercising the power of fascination\r\naffects the person fascinated through the sense of sight; but it\r\nsuggests that the soul of the fascinator has been endowed by the stars\r\nwith power over the soul of the fascinated, whereas Aquinas denied\r\nthat certain men were made magicians by their nativities. Finally\r\n_De fato_ does not, like Aquinas, reject astrological images, but\r\ndeclares that celestial influence is received by artificial as well\r\nas by natural objects, “and therefore the figures of magic images are\r\nengraved according to the constellations.”\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1969] Ptolemy of Lucca, _Hist. Eccles._, XXIII, 7 (_Muratori_, XI,\r\n1169), recounting the death of Aquinas remarks, “Unde cum multa\r\ndevotione et mentis puritate et corporis qua semper floruit et in\r\nOrdine viguit, quemque ego probavi inter homines quos umquam novi qui\r\nsuam saepe confessionem audivi et cum ipso multo tempore conversatus\r\nsum familiari ministerio ac ipsius auditor fui, ex hac luce transiit ad\r\nChristum....”\r\n\r\n[1970] _Ibid._, XXII, 20 (_Muratori_, XI, 1152).\r\n\r\n[1971] Brewer (1859), p. 426.\r\n\r\n[1972] _Bonum universale de apibus_, I, 20, xi.\r\n\r\n[1973] Peter of Prussia (1621), pp. 90-104.\r\n\r\n[1974] v.

Fossi, _Catalogus codicum saeculo\r\nXV impressorum qui in publica Bibliotheca Magliabechiana Florentiae\r\nadservantur_, 1793-1795, II, 663-98.\r\n\r\n[1976] I have not had access to M. Grabmann, _Les Commentaires de Saint\r\nThomas d’Aquin sur les ouvrages d’Aristote_, in _Annales de l’Institut\r\nSupérieur de Philosophie_, Louvain, III (1914), 229-82, nor to R.\r\nSimiterre, _Sur les condemnations d’Aristote et de Saint Thomas d’Aquin\r\nau XIIIe siècle_, in _Revue pratique d’Apologétique_, V (1907), 502-15.\r\n\r\n[1977] Thus Rashdall, _The Universities of Europe in the Middle\r\nAges_, 1895, I, 361, says, “Thomas Aquinas endeavored to procure\r\nbetter translations from the original Greek, and his efforts were\r\nseconded by Pope Urban IV. Special translations or special revisions\r\nof the existing Graeco-Latin translations were prepared for his use\r\nby a Dominican Friar of Greek birth, variously known as Wilhelmus\r\nde Brabantia or Wilhelmus de Moerbeka. To him at least the common\r\ntradition of the Middle Ages ascribes the _translatio nova_ of the\r\nbooks of Natural and Moral Philosophy, which, in spite of many\r\nimperfections, held its place in the schools as a kind of authorized\r\nversion of Aristotle till the dawn of the New Learning.” Citing\r\nJourdain, _Recherches_, p. 67, _et seq._; Denifle, _Archiv_, II, 226-7.\r\nWilliam the Fleming, as he is also called, was scarcely of Greek birth,\r\nbut of course finally became archbishop of Corinth.\r\n\r\n[1978] In the 14th century bibliography of writings by Dominicans,\r\nDenifle (1886), p. 237, it is stated that William of Brabant,\r\narchbishop of Corinth (he became so in 1277 after Aquinas’ death),\r\n“translated all the books of natural and moral philosophy from Greek\r\ninto Latin at the instance of brother Thomas.” But of the numerous\r\nsigned translations by William extant very few are of works by\r\nAristotle. Moreover, is the Thomas here mentioned Aquinas? The very\r\nnext name in the bibliography in question to follow this Wilhelmus\r\nBrabantinus is Thomas Brabantinus or Thomas of Cantimpré, who may have\r\nbeen the person to suggest the translation to his fellow Fleming.\r\nHowever, Aquinas and William were both connected with the popes in\r\nItaly in the 1260’s, and Aquinas would seem to have had more interest\r\nin a translation of Aristotle than Albert’s other “auditor,” Thomas of\r\nCantimpré.\r\n\r\nThe following extracts from medieval chronicles specifically mention\r\nAquinas, but as their dates are obviously incorrect not much reliance\r\nis to be placed upon them.\r\n\r\n_In Chronico Slavicorum apud Lindenbrogium ad annum 1249._ “Wilhelmus\r\nde Brabantia Ordinis Praedicatorum transtulit omnes libros Aristotelis\r\nde graeco in Latinum verbum a verbo (qua translatione scholares adhuc\r\nhodierna die utuntur in scholis) ad instantiam sancti Thomae de Aquino\r\nDoctoris.”\r\n\r\n_In Chronico Susati, quod MS servat Veneta SS. Ioannis et Pauli\r\nbibliotheca._ “Anno Domini 1267 fr. Wilhelmus Brabantinus,\r\ncorinthiensis de Ordine fratrum Praedicatorum, rebus excessit humanis,\r\nbaccalarius in theologia. Hic transtulit omnes libros Aristotelis\r\nRationalis Naturalis et Moralis Philosophiae et Metaphysicae de graeco\r\nin latinum, verbum a verbo, quibus nunc utimur in scholis ad instantiam\r\nsancti Thomae de Aquino. Nam temporibus domini Alberti translatione\r\nvetere omnes communiter utebantur.” “Albert’s day” was of course no\r\ndifferent from Aquinas’ whom he outlived by six years.\r\n\r\nIn 1847 the _Histoire Littéraire_, XXI, 147, said, “Guillaume de\r\nMeerbeke passe pour avoir traduit tous les livres d’Aristote, à la\r\nprière de saint Thomas. Nous n’oserions affirmer ni cette intervention\r\ndu docteur angélique, ni cette immensité des travaux du traducteur\r\nbrabançon. Il s’en faut qu’on ait de lui une série si volumineuse de\r\nversions latines.”\r\n\r\n[1979] As has been pointed out by HL XXI, 147, in the case of the “new\r\ntranslation” of the Ethics, dated in the colophon in 1282, whereas\r\nAquinas died in 1274. Quetif and Echard (1719), I, 390, had argued,\r\nhowever, that this date was when the MS was copied and not when the\r\ntranslation was made; but this is far-fetched as most of William’s\r\ntranslations are similarly dated. Certainly William’s labors as a\r\ntranslator did not cease with his elevation to the archbishopric of\r\nCorinth, since he translated Galen _De alimentis_ in 1277 and works by\r\nProclus in 1281.\r\n\r\nQuetif and Echard, in order to maintain the cooperation supposed to\r\nexist between William and Aquinas, also hold that William’s translation\r\nof the _Elementatio theologica_ of Proclus made at Viterbo in 1268\r\nwas from the Arabic and not from the Greek, since Aquinas says in his\r\ncommentary on that work that the Greek text had not yet been found.\r\nThis conclusion is also drawn by HL XXI, 148.\r\n\r\n[1980] See Duhem II (1914), 394, for a like opinion expressed by\r\nAugustine.\r\n\r\n[1981] _Opera_, 27, 248.\r\n\r\n[1982] _Chartularium univ.

The Gospel account led the Priscillianists to subject all human\r\nacts to fate and the Manicheans to repudiate the Book of Matthew as\r\ninculcating a belief in fate. Against them are rehearsed the following\r\narguments. First, as Augustine says (_Contra Faustum_, II, 5), no\r\nastrologer asserts that a star will leave its usual position at a\r\nman’s birth and go to him, as the Gospel narrative asserts that the\r\nstar in the east did, and hence Matthew confounds rather than defends\r\nthe error of astrology. Aquinas then quotes with apparent approval\r\nthe erroneous assertion of Chrysostom (_Homily 6 in Matth._) that “it\r\nis not astronomy’s task to tell from the stars who are being born,\r\nbut to predict the future from the hour of nativity.” He also notes\r\nChrysostom’s objection that it took the Magi over two years to travel\r\nto Bethlehem so that the star must have appeared two years before\r\nChrist’s birth. This, by the way, would make the date 4 B. C., usually\r\ngiven for the birth of Christ, fit nicely into Münter’s date of 6 B.\r\nC. for the constellation which portended it. Aquinas also repeats the\r\nargument that the star was probably a new creation of God.\r\n\r\nBut all these criticisms are really quite beside the point, since even\r\naccording to the Bible story, the Magi, who were evidently astronomers,\r\nknew perfectly well what the star meant. Indeed, Aquinas himself\r\nrepeats the statement that the birth of Christ was announced to them\r\nby a star, although to Simon and Anna and to the shepherds by other\r\nmethods, because they were used to stars. If it was a very unusual kind\r\nof star and had a very unusual meaning, all that simply goes to show\r\nthat a good astrologer is equal to any emergency. Aquinas, indeed, or\r\nrather, his authorities, sees the need of stating some other method\r\nthan astrological skill by which the Magi comprehended the significance\r\nof the star. He adduces two explanations from Augustine (_Sermo 374\r\nde Epiphania_, and _De quaest. vet. et nov. test., Quaest. 63_); one\r\nthat they were admonished by angels, which makes us wonder why there\r\nwas any star at all; the other, that Balaam had left them a prediction\r\nconcerning the coming of the star.\r\n\r\nAquinas also repeats something of what the fathers have said on the\r\nallegorical significance of the Magi. But on the whole he, like\r\nhis authorities, fails signally to explain away the astrological\r\nsignificance of the Magi.\r\n\r\n[2024] _Hist. eccles._ XXIII, 13 (Muratori XI, 1170).

I have also seen the treatise ascribed to Albert\r\nin the Explicit of Sloane 2156, 15th century, fols. 154-9.\r\n\r\nIn Bologna University Library, 1158, 14th century, where the first\r\ntreatise in the MS at fols. 1-39 is the treatise of Aquinas against\r\nWilliam of St. Amour, our treatise together with another _De fato_\r\nwhich follows it and brief treatises on divination and lots are\r\ncatalogued together as fols. 41-52, “Magistri Alberti theotonici de\r\nfato, de divinatione, de sortibus.” In the MS itself, however, the\r\nonly statements as to authorship are headings in the margin. That\r\nat the beginning of our _De fato_ seems to be “Magri” (Magistri)\r\n“Alrti” (or Alxri, rather than Alberti) and a third word which looks\r\nlike “Theotonici.” The second _De fato_ is headed “Magri (Magistri)\r\nAlexandri” in the upper margin of fol. 45r, and the next treatise is\r\nheaded, fol. 47r, “Questio de divinatione Alexandri.” The anonymous _De\r\nsortibus_ which follows it is also not Aquinas’. The second treatise on\r\nfate considers six questions, of which the last is whether Christ was\r\nphysically subject to the influence of the constellations like other\r\nmen.\r\n\r\n[2029] In BN 16096, 13th century, fol. 138r-, is another which seems\r\ndifferent from either of the _De fato’s_ mentioned in the preceding\r\nnote. The catalogue questioningly assigns it to Alexander, but is\r\nprobably misled by a rubric at fol. 139v which seems to be simply\r\na citation (“in sic inscripto libro”) and which reads, “Alexandri\r\naffridisei ad imperatores antoninum et severinum liber de fato.” In\r\nthis same MS at fols. 120v-122r occurs Aquinas’ _De occultis operibus_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXI\r\n\r\nROGER BACON\r\n\r\n\r\n Bibliographical note--Our method of considering him.\r\n\r\n I. _Life_\r\n\r\n Birth, family, and early life--The years before 1267--Bacon\r\n and the mariner’s compass--The papal mandate--The\r\n composition of the three works--The injunction of\r\n secrecy--Roger Bacon and the Franciscans--Bacon’s life after\r\n 1267--His reported condemnation--Franciscans and science:\r\n John Peckham--Was Bacon still writing in 1292?\r\n\r\n II. _His Criticism of and Part in Medieval Learning_\r\n\r\n Aims and plan of the _Opus Maius_--Bacon’s theological\r\n standpoint--His scholastic side--Attitude to Aristotle\r\n and other authorities--Bacon’s critical bent--Criticism\r\n easier than construction--Commonplaces of medieval\r\n criticism--Debt of Bacon to earlier writers--Limitations\r\n of his criticism--Roger Bacon and Albertus Magnus--Bacon’s\r\n criticism of education applies chiefly to the training\r\n of the friars in theology--His other criticisms of\r\n contemporary education--His personal motives--Inaccuracy\r\n of much of his criticism--Bacon does not regard himself\r\n as unique--Instances of ideas which were not new with\r\n him--Bacon and the discovery of America--His historical\r\n attitude--His “mathematical method”--Its crudity--Its debt\r\n to others.\r\n\r\n III. _His Experimental Science_\r\n\r\n Has been given undue prominence--“Experimental science”\r\n distinct from other natural sciences--As a criterion of\r\n truth--Lack of method--Bacon and inventions--Marvelous\r\n results expected--Fantastic “experiments”--Credulity\r\n essential--Good flying dragons--Experiment and magic.\r\n\r\n IV. _His Attitude Toward Magic and Astrology_\r\n\r\n Magic and astrology--Magic in the past--Magicians and\r\n their books still prevalent--Magic a delusion--Some truth\r\n in magic--Magic and science--His belief in marvelous\r\n “extraneous virtues”--Non-magical fascination--The power\r\n of words--Magic and science again--The multiplication\r\n of species--William of St. Cloud on works of art and\r\n nature compared to magic--The two mathematics--Four\r\n objections to the forbidden variety--The rule of the\r\n stars--Astrological medicine--Influence of the stars upon\r\n human conduct--Planetary conjunctions and religious\r\n movements--Was Christ born under the stars?--Operative\r\n astrology--Unlikelihood that Bacon was condemned for magic\r\n or astrology--Error of Charles in thinking that any stigma\r\n rested on Bacon’s memory--But his own statements may have\r\n given rise to the legend.\r\n\r\n V. _Conclusion_\r\n\r\n Characteristics of medieval books--Features of the _Opus\r\n Maius_.\r\n\r\n Appendix I.

Roger Bacon and Gunpowder.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Our method of considering him.]\r\n\r\nContemporary with the three learned Dominicans of whom preceding\r\nchapters have treated--Albert, Thomas, and Vincent--was the Franciscan\r\nfriar, Roger Bacon, who in modern times has received so much attention\r\nand admiration at the expense of his contemporaries and his age.[2030]\r\nHappily in the present volume we are in a better position to estimate\r\nhim fairly. The best, if not the only way to appreciate him aright is\r\nby a detailed study of the writings and doctrines of his predecessors\r\nand contemporaries. Roger Bacon has hitherto been studied too much\r\nin isolation. He has been regarded as an exceptional individual; his\r\nenvironment has been estimated at his own valuation of it or according\r\nto some preconceived idea of his age; and his writings have not been\r\nstudied in relation to those of his predecessors and contemporaries.\r\nThought of as a precursor of modern science, he has been read to\r\nfind germs of modern ideas rather than scrutinized with a view to\r\ndiscovering his sources. Yet his constant citing of authorities and the\r\nhelpful footnotes which Bridges, in his edition of the _Opus Maius_,\r\ngives to explain these allusions to other scientists, point insistently\r\nin the latter direction. When one has gone a step further and has read\r\nfor their own sake the works of men like Adelard of Bath, William of\r\nConches, and Daniel of Morley in the twelfth century, or William of\r\nAuvergne, Robert Grosseteste and Albert Magnus in the early and middle\r\nthirteenth century, the true position of Roger Bacon in the history of\r\nthought grows clearer. One then re-reads his works with a new insight,\r\nfinds that a different interpretation may be put upon many a passage,\r\nand realizes that even in his most boastful moments Roger himself never\r\nmade such claims to astounding originality as some modern writers\r\nhave made for him. Conversely, one is impelled to the conclusion that\r\nBacon’s writings, instead of being unpalatable to, neglected by, and\r\nfar in advance of, his times, give a most valuable picture of medieval\r\nthought, summarizing, it is true, its most advanced stages, but also\r\nincluding much that is most characteristic, and even revealing some of\r\nits back currents. It is from this standpoint that we shall consider\r\nRoger Bacon and endeavor to refute misconceptions that have grown up\r\nconcerning his life and learning. We shall also, in conformity with\r\nour main theme, take particular note of his experimental science, long\r\nregarded as the brightest gem in his crown, and of other aspects of his\r\nlearning which have hitherto not received special or proper treatment,\r\nnamely, the astrology and magic to which he gives so much space and\r\nemphasis and which so seriously affect all his thought, but which\r\nprobably did not affect his life and the attitude of his age towards\r\nhim in the way that many have assumed.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. _Life_\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Birth, family, and early life.]\r\n\r\nPast estimates of Bacon’s learning have been greatly affected by their\r\nholders’ views of his life; but his biography is gradually being shorn\r\nof fictions and losing that sensational and exceptional character\r\nwhich gave countenance to the representation of his thought as far\r\nin advance of his age. We cannot tell to which of several families\r\nof Bacons mentioned in feudal registers and other documents of the\r\ntimes he belonged, and the exact date and place of his birth are\r\nuncertain.[2031] But he speaks of England as his native land, and in\r\n1267 looks back upon a past of some forty years of study and twenty\r\nyears of specialization in his favorite branches of learning.[2032] In\r\nanother passage he mentions having spent all his spare time for ten\r\nyears upon the science of perspective.[2033] Also he speaks of one\r\nbrother as rich, of another as a student, and of his family’s suffering\r\nexile for their support of Henry III against the barons.[2034]\r\nHe implies that up to 1267 he had not been outside France and\r\nEngland,[2035] but he had sent across the seas for material to assist\r\nhis special investigations and had spent large sums of money.[2036]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The years before 1267.]\r\n\r\nBefore he became a friar he had written text-books for students, and\r\nhad worked so hard that men wondered that he still lived. When or why\r\nhe joined the Franciscans we are not informed,[2037] but his doing\r\nso is no cause for wonder, for both Orders were rich in learned men,\r\nincluding students of natural science. Bacon tells us that after\r\nbecoming a friar he was able to study as much as before, but “did\r\nnot work so much,” probably because he now had less teaching to do.\r\nFor about ten years before 1267, instead of being imprisoned and\r\nill-treated by his order, as was once believed without foundation, he\r\nwas, as we now know from his own words discovered in 1897, in poor\r\nhealth and “took no part in the outward affairs of the university.”\r\nThis abstention caused the report to spread that he was devoting all\r\nhis time to writing, especially since many were aware that he had long\r\nintended to sum up his knowledge in a _magnum opus_, but he actually\r\n“composed nothing except a few chapters, now about one science and now\r\nabout another, compiled in odd moments at the instance of friends.”\r\nAt least this is what he told the pope in 1267 when trying to excuse\r\nhimself for having had no completed work ready to submit to the supreme\r\npontiff.[2038] During these years he seems to have fallen into some\r\nobscurity, since in the _Opus Tertium_ he compares his tone in the\r\n_Opus Minus_ to that of Cicero, when recalled from exile, in the letter\r\nin which he humbled himself and congratulated the Roman senate. So\r\nBacon, describing himself probably with some rhetorical exaggeration as\r\nan exile for the past ten years from his former scholastic fame,[2039]\r\nrecognizes his own littleness and admires the wisdom of the pope, who\r\nhas deigned to seek works of scholarship “from me, now unheard by\r\nanyone and as it were buried in oblivion.”[2040]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Bacon and the mariner’s compass.]\r\n\r\nR. H. Major’s _Prince Henry the Navigator_ is responsible for the\r\nspread of the story that in 1258 Brunetto Latini saw Friar Bacon\r\nat the Parliament at Oxford and was shown by him the secret of the\r\nmagnetic needle, which Roger dared not divulge for fear of being\r\naccused of magic. The supposed letter of Brunetto Latini to the poet\r\nGuido Cavalcanti, from which these data are drawn, seems to have\r\nbeen a hoax or fanciful production appearing first in 1802 in the\r\n_Monthly Magazine_[2041] among “Extracts from the Portfolio of a Man of\r\nLetters,” who is said to have translated them from “the French patois\r\nof the Romansch language.” Certainly the mariner’s compass was pretty\r\nwell known in Bacon’s time, nor are we informed of any case where it\r\ninvolved its possessor in a trial for magic. Bacon says in one passage\r\nthat if the experiment of the magnet with respect to iron “were not\r\nknown to the world, it would seem a great miracle.”[2042] In another\r\nplace he grants that even the common herd of philosophers know of the\r\nmagnetic needle; he merely criticizes their belief that the needle\r\nalways turns towards the north star; Roger thinks that it can be made\r\nto turn to any other point of the compass if only it has been properly\r\nmagnetized.[2043] Perhaps the Latini story was suggested by a third\r\npassage, where Bacon says, in order to illustrate his statement that\r\nphilosophers have sometimes resorted to charms and incantations to hide\r\ntheir secrets from the unworthy, “As if, for instance, it were quite\r\nunknown that the magnetic needle attracts iron and someone wishing to\r\nperform this operation before the people should make characters and\r\nutter incantations, so that they might not see that the operation of\r\nattraction was entirely natural.”[2044]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The papal mandate.]\r\n\r\nBacon’s career centers about a papal mandate which was despatched to\r\nhim in the summer of 1266. Guy de Foulques, who became Clement IV on\r\nFebruary 5, 1265, had at some previous time requested Bacon to send\r\nhim the _scriptum principale_ or comprehensive work on philosophy\r\nwhich he had been led to think was already written.[2045] On June 22,\r\n1266, he repeated this request in the form of a papal mandate, which\r\nis extant.[2046] The former letter is lost, but both Bacon and the\r\npope refer to it.[2047] Somehow writers on Bacon have paid little\r\nheed to this first request, have assumed that Bacon wrote his three\r\nworks to the pope in about a year[2048] despite the “impediments” upon\r\nwhich he dwells, and have therefore been filled with admiration at\r\nthe superhuman genius which could produce such works at such short\r\nnotice while laboring under such difficulties.[2049] But this is\r\nassuming that Roger had done nothing in the considerable interval\r\nbetween the two mandates. And why does he keep apologizing for “so\r\ngreat delay in this matter,” and “Your Clemency’s impatience at hope\r\ndeferred.”[2050] Moreover, his excuses do not all apply to the same\r\nperiod, and most of them are excuses for not having composed a full\r\nexposition of philosophy rather than for not having composed sooner the\r\n_Opus Maius_, which Roger regarded as a mere preamble to philosophy.\r\nOne set of excuses explains why he had no comprehensive work ready when\r\nthe first request arrived.[2051] A second set explains why he had not\r\nwritten it in the interval between the two mandates.[2052] A third set\r\nexplains why he finally does not write it at all but sends instead an\r\nintroductory treatise, the _Opus Maius_, supplemented by two others,\r\nthe _Opus Minus_ and _Opus Tertium_. Of course some excuses hold\r\nequally good for all three periods. But he states in the third treatise\r\nthat in writing the second he was free from some of the “impediments”\r\nwhich had hampered his composition of the _Opus Maius_.[2053] As he\r\nalso says that one reason for writing the _Opus Minus_ was lest the\r\n_Opus Maius_ be lost amid the great dangers of the roads at that time,\r\none infers that the latter work was despatched before the other.\r\nMoreover, the _Opus Minus_ opens with a eulogy of the pope which is\r\nabsent in the _Opus Maius_,[2054] in which there are very few passages\r\nto suggest that it is addressed to the pope, or written later than\r\n1266.[2055]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The composition of the three works.]\r\n\r\nThe _Opus Maius_, therefore, was practically finished, if not already\r\nsent, when the papal mandate of 1266 reached Bacon. When Roger learned\r\nthat Foulques as pope was still interested in his work, visions of what\r\nthe apostolic see might do for his programme of learning and himself\r\nflashed before his mind, and, after a fresh but vain effort at a\r\n_scriptum principale_, which kept him busy until Epiphany, he composed\r\nthe supplementary treatise, the _Opus Minus_, with its adulatory\r\nintroduction to Clement IV, with its excuses for sending or having sent\r\na preambulatory treatise instead of a complete work of philosophy, with\r\nits hints that such a final treatise can be successfully completed only\r\nwith the financial backing of the unlimited papal resources, with its\r\nanalysis of the preceding work for the benefit of the busy pope and\r\nits suggestions as to what portions of it he might profitably omit,\r\nand with its additions of matter which in the _Opus Maius_ Roger had\r\neither forgotten or at that time had not been in a position to insert.\r\nThe third work, _Opus Tertium_, is of the same sort but apparently\r\nmore disorderly in arrangement, and looser and more extravagant in its\r\ntone. Presumably it was undertaken to remind the pope again of Bacon’s\r\nexistence and proposals; it is even conceivable that Roger was a little\r\nunstrung when he composed it; it has been suggested that it was left\r\nunfinished and never sent to the pope, who died in 1268. A part at\r\nleast of the _Opus Tertium_ was written in 1267.[2056]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The injunction of secrecy.]\r\n\r\nThe extant papal mandate orders Bacon not only to send his book but to\r\nstate “what remedies you think should be applied in those matters which\r\nyou recently intimated were of so great importance,” and to “do this\r\nwithout delay as secretly as you can.”[2057] This allusion to matters\r\nof importance and this injunction of secrecy have cast a certain veil\r\nof mystery over the three works and the relations of Roger and the\r\npope. Observance of secrecy may have been intended to guard against\r\nsuch frauds of copyists as we shall soon hear Bacon describe, or to\r\nsecure some alchemistic arcana or practical inventions which the\r\npope had been led to expect from him. Indeed, so far as alchemy was\r\nconcerned, Bacon observed the injunction of secrecy so strictly that he\r\ndivided his discussion of the subject among four different treatises\r\nsent to the pope at different times and by different messengers, so\r\nthat no outsider might steal the precious truth. It must be added that\r\neven after receiving all four instalments, the pope would not have been\r\nmuch nearer the philosopher’s stone than before.[2058]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Roger Bacon and the Franciscans.]\r\n\r\nAnother moot question in Bacon’s biography besides that of the\r\ncomposition of the three works is that of his relations with the\r\nFranciscan Order. We have seen that it was natural for him to join\r\nit, and that the change, at first at least, seemed one for the\r\nbetter. Bacon, however, found irksome the rule made by the order\r\nin 1260, as a consequence of the publication in 1254 of Gerard’s\r\nheretical _Introductorius in Evangelium Aeternum_, that in the future\r\nno Franciscan should publish anything without permission.[2059]\r\nRoger wished to employ amanuenses even in composing his works, and\r\nthese men, he tells the pope, would often divulge “the most secret\r\nwritings,”[2060] and so involve one in unintentional violation of the\r\nabove rule. “And therefore,” says Bacon, “I did not feel the least\r\nbit like writing anything.”[2061] For a man so easily discouraged one\r\ncannot feel much sympathy. There is however another important inference\r\nfrom his statement: instead of his writings being neglected by his\r\nage, they are so valued that they are pirated before they have been\r\npublished. Moreover, this rule of his order should not have hampered\r\nBacon much in writing for the pope; indeed, Roger himself implies that\r\nhe was exempted from this restriction in the earlier request from the\r\ncardinal as well as in the later papal mandate. Raymond of Laon, Bacon\r\ngrants, had correctly informed “Your Magnificence, as both the mandates\r\nstate,” concerning this regulation, though he had given a wrong\r\nimpression as to what Bacon already had written.[2062]\r\n\r\nWe have heard from Bacon’s own mouth that he did little public teaching\r\nafter becoming a friar, that he had as much time for private study as\r\never, and that everybody supposed him to be at work at his _magnum\r\nopus_. Yet in the _Opus Minus_ he grumbles that “his prelates were at\r\nhim every day to do other things”[2063] before he received the first\r\nmandate from the cardinal, and that even thereafter he was unable to\r\nexcuse himself fully from their demands upon his time, “because Your\r\nLordship had ordered me to treat that business secretly, nor had Your\r\nGlory given them any instructions.”[2064] In the _Opus Tertium_ he\r\ndescribes the same situation in stronger language: “They pressed me\r\nwith unspeakable violence to obey their will as others did,” and “I\r\nsustained so many and so great setbacks that I cannot tell them.”[2065]\r\nOn how we interpret a few such passages as these depends our estimate\r\nof the attitude of the Franciscan Order before 1267 to Bacon and his\r\nideas and researches. He gives so many other reasons why he has no\r\ncomprehensive work of philosophy ready for the pope that this attitude\r\nof his superiors seems a relatively slight factor. He needed much\r\nmoney, he needed expensive instruments, he needed a large library,\r\nhe needed “plenty of parchment,” he needed a corps of assistant\r\ninvestigators and another of copyists with skilled superintendents to\r\ndirect their efforts and insert figures and other delicate details.\r\nIt was a task beyond the powers of any one man; besides, he was in\r\nill-health, he felt languid, he composed very slowly. Shall we blame\r\nhis superiors for not providing him with this expensive equipment;\r\nand are we surprised, when we remember that the mandates directed him\r\nto send a book supposed to be already finished, that his superiors\r\ncontinued to ask of him the performance of his usual duties as a friar?\r\nTheir attitude can scarcely be regarded as persecution of Bacon or\r\nhostility to his science. On the other hand, Clement IV must be given\r\ncredit for his effort to elicit from Bacon a _scriptum principale_; and\r\nit may well be doubted if Roger would have produced anything equivalent\r\nto the _Opus Maius_, _Opus Minus_ and _Opus Tertium_ without this papal\r\nencouragement.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Bacon’s life after 1267.]\r\n\r\nIn 1272 in the _Compendium Studii Philosophiae_ Bacon lays bare the\r\nfailings of “the two orders” as if he belonged to neither, but he then\r\nproceeds to refute indignantly those masters at Paris who have tried to\r\nargue that the state of the higher secular clergy, such as bishops, is\r\nmore perfect than that of the religious.[2066]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: His reported condemnation.]\r\n\r\nIn 1277, however, we learn “solely on the very contestable authority\r\nof the Chronicle of the XXIV Generals,”[2067] a work written about\r\n1370, although containing earlier matter,[2068] that at the suggestion\r\nof many friars the teaching of “Friar Roger Bacon of England, master\r\nof sacred theology,” was condemned as containing “some suspected\r\nnovelties,” that Roger was sentenced to prison, and that the pope was\r\nasked to help to suppress the dangerous doctrines in question. It has\r\nbeen a favorite conjecture of students of Bacon that he incurred this\r\ncondemnation by his leanings toward astrology and magic; but, as we\r\nshall see later, his views on these subjects were not novelties. He\r\nshared them with Albertus Magnus and other contemporaries, and there\r\nseems no good reason why they should have got him into trouble. Suffice\r\nit here to note that the wording of the chronicle suggests nothing of\r\nthe sort, but rather some details of doctrine, whereas had Bacon been\r\ncharged with magic, we may be pretty sure that so sensational a feature\r\nwould not have passed unmentioned.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Franciscans and science: John Peckham.]\r\n\r\nHow absurd it is to think that the Franciscan Order was opposed to\r\nBacon’s pursuit of natural and experimental science, or that he was\r\nalone among the members of that order in the pursuit of such subjects,\r\nmay be inferred from a glance at the career of John Peckham who from\r\n1279 to his death in 1292 was archbishop of Canterbury.[2069] According\r\nto a letter of Bacon’s favorite, Adam Marsh, Peckham entered the\r\nFranciscan Order about 1250. He had been educated in France but about\r\n1270 became lector of his order at Oxford. He also became the ninth\r\nprovincial minister of the Franciscans in England, and had been called\r\nto Rome by the pope to be _Lector sacri palatii_ before his nomination\r\nby the pope to the archbishopric of Canterbury. Yet this Franciscan\r\nwho rose so high in the church was the author of a treatise on\r\nPerspective, one of the five subjects which Bacon held could be of such\r\nservice to the church and yet were being so woefully neglected. In his\r\n_Perspectiva communis_, which was printed at Venice in 1504, Peckham\r\ntalks of such matters as the reflection of visible rays and experiment.\r\nA work on the sphere and a _Theory of the Planets_ which exists only\r\nin manuscript are also attributed to him. It has even been suggested\r\nthat he was the bright lad John whom Bacon sent to explain his work to\r\nthe pope, but Peckham was evidently too old in 1267 to fill that rôle.\r\nBartholomew of England was another Franciscan interested, as we have\r\nseen, both in natural science and astrology, and other Friar Preachers\r\nthan Albertus Magnus and Aquinas showed the same interest.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Was Bacon still writing in 1292?]\r\n\r\nThis is about all that we know of Bacon’s life except the dates of\r\none or two more of his works. Mr. Little regards it as “certain that\r\nRoger’s last dated work was written in 1292.”[2070] This was his\r\ntreatise on the study of theology, which in one passage gives the year\r\nas 1292 and in another speaks of “forty years and more” as having\r\nelapsed since 1250.[2071] It is rather surprising to find his literary\r\nactivity continuing so late, since in 1267 he wrote as if well along in\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. _His Criticism of and Part in Medieval Learning_\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Aims and plan of the _Opus Maius_.]\r\n\r\nWe turn from Bacon’s life to his writings, and shall center our\r\nattention upon his three works to the pope. In them he had his greatest\r\nopportunity and did his best work both in style and substance. They\r\nembody most of his ideas and knowledge. Much, for example, of the\r\ncelebrated “Epistle concerning the secret works of art and nature and\r\nthe nullity of magic” sounds like a later compilation from these three\r\nworks.[2072] Two of them are merely supplementary to the _Opus Maius_\r\nand are parallel to it in aims, plan, and contents. Its two chief aims\r\nwere to demonstrate the practical utility of “philosophy,” especially\r\nto the Church, and secondly, to reform the present state of learning\r\naccording to Bacon’s idea of the relative importance of the sciences.\r\nHaving convinced himself that an exhaustive work on philosophy was not\r\nyet possible, Roger substituted this introductory treatise, outlining\r\nthe paths along which future study and investigation should go. Of\r\nthe thirty divisions of philosophy he considers only the five which\r\nhe deems the most important and essential, namely, the languages,\r\n“mathematics,” perspective or optic, “experimental science” (including\r\nalchemy), and moral philosophy, which last he regards as “the noblest”\r\nand “the mistress of them all.”[2073] Treated in this order, these\r\n“sciences” form the themes of the last five of the seven sections of\r\nthe _Opus Maius_. Inasmuch as Roger regarded himself as a reformer of\r\nthe state of learning, he prefixed a first part on the causes of human\r\nerror to justify his divergence from the views of the multitude. His\r\nsecond section develops his ideas as to the relations of “philosophy”\r\nand theology.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Bacon’s theological standpoint.]\r\n\r\nThe mere plan of the _Opus Maius_ thus indicates that it is not\r\nexclusively devoted to natural science. “Divine wisdom,” or theology,\r\nis the end that all human thought should serve, and morality is the\r\nsupreme science. Children should receive more education in the Bible\r\nand the fundamentals of Christianity, and spend less time upon “the\r\nfables and insanities” of Ovid and other poets who are full of errors\r\nin faith and morals.[2074] In discussing other sciences Bacon’s eye is\r\never fixed upon their utility “to the Church of God, to the republic\r\nof the faithful, toward the conversion of infidels and the conquest of\r\nsuch as cannot be converted.”[2075] This service is to be rendered not\r\nmerely by practical inventions or calendar reform or revision of the\r\nVulgate, but by aiding in most elaborate and far-fetched allegorical\r\ninterpretation of the Bible. To give a very simple example of this, it\r\nis not enough for the interpreter of Scripture to know that the lion is\r\nthe king of beasts; he must be so thoroughly acquainted with all the\r\nlion’s natural properties that he can tell whether in any particular\r\npassage it is meant to typify Christ or the devil.[2076] Also the\r\nmarvels of human science strengthen our faith in divine miracles.[2077]\r\nBacon speaks of philosophy as the handmaid of “sacred wisdom”;[2078]\r\nhe asserts that all truth is contained in Scripture, though philosophy\r\nand canon law are required for its comprehension and exposition, and\r\nthat anything alien therefrom is utterly erroneous.[2079] Nay more, the\r\nBible is surer ground than philosophy even in the latter’s own field of\r\nthe natures and properties of things.[2080] Furthermore, “philosophy\r\nconsidered by itself is of no utility.”[2081] Bacon believed not\r\nonly that the active intellect (_intellectus agens_) by which our\r\nminds are illuminated was from God and not an integral part of the\r\nhuman mind,[2082] but that all philosophy had been revealed by God to\r\nthe sainted patriarchs and again to Solomon,[2083] and that it was\r\nimpossible for man by his own efforts to attain to “the great truths\r\nof the arts and sciences.”[2084] Bacon alludes several times to sin as\r\nan obstacle to the acquisition of science;[2085] on the other hand,\r\nhe observes that contemporary Christians are inferior morally to the\r\npagan philosophers, from whose books they might well take a leaf.[2086]\r\nAll this gives little evidence of an independent scientific spirit,\r\nor of appreciation of experimental method as the one sure foundation\r\nof scientific knowledge. We see how much of a medieval friar and\r\ntheologian and how little of a modern scientist Roger could be. It\r\nmust, of course, be remembered that he is trying to persuade the Church\r\nto support scientific research; still, there seems to be no sufficient\r\nreason for doubting his sincerity in the above statements, though we\r\nmust discount here as elsewhere his tendency to make emphatic and\r\nsweeping assertions.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Bacon’s scholastic side.]\r\n\r\nWriters as far back as Cousin[2087] and Charles have recognized that\r\nBacon was interested in the scholasticism of his time as well as in\r\nnatural science. His separate works on the Metaphysics and Physics of\r\nAristotle are pretty much the usual sort of medieval commentary;[2088]\r\nthe tiresome dialectic of the _Questions on Aristotle’s Physics_ is\r\nwell brought out in Duhem’s essay, “Roger Bacon et l’Horreur du\r\nVide.”[2089] Bacon’s works dedicated to the pope, on the contrary, are\r\nwritten to a considerable extent in a clear, direct, outspoken style;\r\nand the subjects of linguistics, mathematics, and experimental science\r\nseem at first glance to offer little opportunity for metaphysical\r\ndisquisitions or scholastic method. Yet, here too, much space is\r\ndevoted to intellectual battledore and shuttlecock with such concepts\r\nas matter and form, moved and mover, agent and patient, element and\r\ncompound.[2090] Such current problems as the unity of the intellect,\r\nthe source of the _intellectus agens_, and the unity or infinity of\r\nmatter are introduced for discussion,[2091] although the question of\r\nuniversals is briefly dismissed.[2092]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Attitude to Aristotle and other authorities.]\r\n\r\nTwo other characteristic traits of scholasticism are found in the _Opus\r\nMaius_, namely, continual use of authorities and the highest regard for\r\nAristotle, _summus philosophorum_,[2093] as Bacon calls him. Because\r\nin one passage in his _Compendium Studii Philosophiae_ Bacon says in\r\nhis exaggerated way that he would burn all the Latin translations of\r\nAristotle if he could,[2094] it has sometimes been assumed that he\r\nwas opposed to the medieval study of Aristotle. Yet in the very next\r\nsentence he declares that “Aristotle’s labors are the foundations of\r\nall wisdom.” What he wanted was more, not less Aristotle. He believed\r\nthat Aristotle had written a thousand works.[2095] He complains quite\r\nas much that certain works of Aristotle have not yet been translated\r\ninto Latin as he does that others have been translated incorrectly.\r\nAs a matter of fact, he himself seems to have made about as many\r\nmistakes in connection with the study of Aristotle as did anyone else.\r\nHe thought many apocryphal writings genuine, such as the _Secret of\r\nSecrets_,[2096] an astrological treatise entitled _De Impressionibus\r\nCoelestibus_,[2097] and other writings concerning “the arcana of\r\nscience” and “marvels of nature.”[2098] He overestimated Aristotle\r\nand blamed the translators for obscurities and difficulties which\r\nabound in the Greek text itself. He declares that a few chapters\r\nof Aristotle’s Laws are superior to the entire _corpus_ of Roman\r\nlaw.[2099] His assertion that Robert Grosseteste paid no attention to\r\ntranslations of Aristotle is regarded as misleading by Baur.[2100]\r\nHe nowhere gives credit to Albertus Magnus and Thomas Aquinas for\r\ntheir great commentaries on Aristotle[2101] which are superior to any\r\nthat he wrote. He bases some of his own views upon mistranslations of\r\nAristotle, substituting, for instance, “matter” for “substance”--a\r\nmistranslation avoided by Albert and Thomas.[2102]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Bacon’s critical bent.]\r\n\r\nDespite its theological and scholastic proclivities, Bacon’s mind\r\nhad a decidedly critical bent. He was, like Petrarch, profoundly\r\npessimistic as to his own times. Church music, present-day sermons,\r\nthe immorality of monks and theologians, the misconduct of students at\r\nOxford and Paris, the wars and exactions of kings and feudal lords,\r\nthe prevalence of Roman Law--these are some of the faults he has to\r\nfind with his age.[2103] The _Opus Maius_ is largely devoted, not to\r\nobjective presentation of facts and discussion of theories, but to\r\nsubjective criticism of the state of learning and even of individual\r\ncontemporary scholars. This last is so unusual that Bacon excuses\r\nhimself for it to the pope in both the supplementary treatises.[2104]\r\nSeveral other works of Bacon display the same critical tendency.\r\nThe _Compendium Studii Philosophiae_ enlarges upon the complaints\r\nand criticisms of the three works. In the _Tractatus de Erroribus\r\nMedicorum_ he detected in contemporary medicine “thirty-six great and\r\nradical defects with infinite ramifications.”[2105] But in medicine,\r\ntoo, his own contributions are of little account. In the _Compendium\r\nStudii Theologiae_, after contemptuous allusion to the huge _Summae_\r\nof the past fifty years, he opens with an examination of the problems\r\nof speculative philosophy which underlie the questions discussed by\r\ncontemporary theologians. As far as we know that is as far as he got.\r\nAnd in the five neglected sciences to which his _Opus Maius_ was a\r\nmere introduction he seems to have made little further progress than\r\nis there recorded; it has yet to be proved that he made any definite\r\noriginal contribution to any particular science.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Criticism easier than construction.]\r\n\r\nAfter all, we must keep in mind the fact that in ancient and medieval\r\ntimes hostile criticism was more likely to hit the mark than were\r\nattempts at constructive thought and collection of scientific details.\r\nThere were plenty of wrong ideas to knock down; it was not easy to\r\nfind a rock foundation to build upon, or materials without some hidden\r\nflaw. The church fathers made many telling shots in their bombardment\r\nof pagan thought; their own interpretation of nature and life less\r\ncommands our admiration. So Roger Bacon, by devoting much of his space\r\nto criticism of the mistakes of others and writing “preambles” to\r\nscience and theology, avoided treacherous detail--a wise caution for\r\nhis times. Thus he constructed a sort of intellectual portico more\r\npretentious than he could have justified by his main building. To a\r\nsuperficial observer this portico may seem a fitting entrance to the\r\ntemple of modern science, but a closer examination discovers that it\r\nis built of the same faulty materials as the neglected ruins of his\r\ncontemporaries’ science.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Commonplaces of medieval criticism.]\r\n\r\nMerely to have assumed a critical point of view in the middle ages may\r\nseem a distinction; but Abelard, Adelard of Bath, William of Conches,\r\nand Daniel Morley were all critical, back in the twelfth century.\r\nMoreover, our estimate of any critic must take into account how valid,\r\nhow accurate, how original and how consistent his criticisms were and\r\nfrom what motives they proceeded. Some of Bacon’s complaints the reader\r\nof medieval literature has often listened to before. What student of\r\nphilosophy in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries had not sighed at\r\nthe invasion of the Roman law into school and church and state? What\r\ndevotee of astronomy had failed to contrast its human interest and\r\ndivine relationships with the dry drubbing of the jurists? What learned\r\nman had not expressed his preference for the wise and the experts\r\n(_sapientes_) over the _vulgus_ or common herd? The great secrets of\r\nlearning and the danger of casting pearls before swine were also quite\r\nfamiliar concepts. If Bacon goes a step farther and speaks of a _vulgus\r\nstudentium_ and even of a _vulgus medicorum_, he is only refining a\r\nmedical commonplace or quoting Galen.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Debt of Bacon to earlier writers.]\r\n\r\nIn Bacon’s discussion of the four causes of human error his attack upon\r\nundue reliance on authority has often seemed to modern readers most\r\nunusual for his age. But all his arguments against authority are drawn\r\nfrom authorities;[2106] and while he seems to have got a whiff of the\r\nspirit of rationalism from such classical writers as Seneca and Cicero,\r\nhe also quotes the _Natural Questions_ of his fellow-countryman,\r\nAdelard of Bath, who in the early twelfth century had found the\r\ndoctrine of the schools of Gaul as little to his liking as was that of\r\nParis to Roger’s taste, and whom we have heard reprove his nephew for\r\nblind trust in authorities.[2107] Bacon’s fourth cause of human error,\r\nthe concealment of ignorance by a false show of learning, might well\r\nhave been suggested by Daniel Morley’s satire on the _bestiales_ who\r\noccupied chairs in the schools of Paris “with grave authority,” and\r\nreverently marked their Ulpians with daggers and asterisks, and seemed\r\nwise as long as they concealed their ignorance by a statuesque silence,\r\nbut whom he found “most childish” when they tried to say anything. Or\r\nby the same Daniel’s warning not to spurn Arabic clarity for Latin\r\nobscurity; and his charge that it was owing to their ignorance and\r\ninability to attain definite conclusions that Latin philosophers of his\r\nday spun so many elaborate figments and hid “uncertain error under the\r\nshadow of ambiguity.”[2108]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Limitations of his criticism.]\r\n\r\nBacon’s criticisms have usually been taken to apply to medieval\r\nlearning as a whole, but a closer examination shows their application\r\nto be much more limited. In the first place, he is thinking only of the\r\npast “forty years” in making his complaints; in the good old days of\r\nGrosseteste, Adam Marsh, William Wolf, and William of Shyrwood things\r\nwere different, and scholarship flowed smoothly, if not copiously, in\r\nthe channels marked out by the ancient sages;[2109] nor does Bacon deny\r\nthat there was a renaissance of natural science and an independent\r\nscientific spirit still farther back in the twelfth century.\r\n\r\nSecondly, except for his tirades against the Italians and their civil\r\nlaw, Bacon’s criticisms apply to but two countries, France and England,\r\nand two universities, Oxford and Paris. Also those few contemporaries\r\nwhom he praises are either his old Oxford friends or scattered\r\nindividuals in France. Of the state of learning in Italy, Spain, and\r\nGermany he says little and apparently knew little. Amid his sighing for\r\nsome prince or prelate to play the patron to science, he never mentions\r\nAlfonso X of Castile, who was so interested in the “mathematics” and\r\noccult science which were so dear to Bacon’s heart;[2110] Roger\r\neven still employs the old Toletan astronomical tables of Arzachel\r\ninstead of the Alfonsine tables issued in 1252, the first year of\r\nthat monarch’s reign.[2111] His lamentation over the sad neglect of\r\nastrology among the “Latins” is not borne out by our investigations of\r\ntheir interest in that subject, and indicates that he was ignorant of\r\nthe work at the University of Bologna of the astrologer, Guido Bonatti,\r\nwhose voluminous Latin treatise on that art based on wide reading in\r\nboth classical and Arabian scholars did not indeed appear until after\r\n1277,[2112] but must have already been in preparation when Bacon wrote,\r\nsince Guido was born at some time before 1223.[2113] Bacon grieves\r\nat the neglect of the science of optic by his age, and says that it\r\nhas not yet been lectured on at Paris nor elsewhere among the Latins\r\nexcept twice at Oxford;[2114] he does not mention the Pole, Witelo,\r\nwho traveled in Italy and whose important treatise on the subject was\r\nproduced at about this time.[2115]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Roger Bacon and Albertus Magnus.]\r\n\r\nWhile complaining of the ignorance of the natures and properties\r\nof animals, plants, and minerals which is shown by contemporary\r\ntheologians in their explanation of Scriptural passages, Bacon not\r\nonly slights the encyclopedias which several clergymen like Alexander\r\nNeckam, Bartholomew of England, Thomas of Cantimpré and Vincent of\r\nBeauvais had compiled; he also says nothing of the school at Cologne\r\nof Albertus Magnus, whose reputation was already established by the\r\nmiddle of the century, who personally investigated many animals,\r\nespecially those of the north, and often rectified the erroneous\r\nassertions of classical zoologists, whom the historian of botany\r\nhas lauded, whose students too were curious to know not only the\r\ntheoretical botany that passed under the name of Aristotle, but also\r\nthe particular characteristics of plants, and who in his five books on\r\nminerals discusses the alchemy and indulges in the same occult science\r\nand astrology which Bacon deemed so important. Yet Albert was a noted\r\ntheologian and Biblical commentator as well as a student of nature.\r\n\r\nIn saying that Bacon does not mention Albert’s work in natural science,\r\nI of course do not mean to imply that he never mentions Albert. He\r\nexcuses his delay in answering the pope by declaring that the most\r\nnoted Christian scholars, such as Brother Albert of the Order of\r\nPreachers, and Master William of Shyrwood, could not in ten years\r\nproduce such a work as he transmits; and he incidentally observes that\r\nWilliam is a far abler scholar than Albert.[2116] I am suspicious,\r\nhowever, of the integrity of the passage[2117] where Bacon sneers at\r\nthe theological teaching of “the boys of the two Orders, such as Albert\r\nand Thomas and the others who enter the Orders when twenty years or\r\nunder.” It seems incongruous for Bacon to speak of his probable senior,\r\nAlbert, as a boy. Other passages in Bacon’s works which have been taken\r\nto apply to Albert, though he is not expressly named, seem to me not\r\nto apply to him at all closely; and if meant for him, they show that\r\nBacon was an incompetent and unfair critic. Not only was Albert only\r\nfor a short time in Paris; he does not seem to have been in sympathy\r\nwith the conditions there which Bacon attacks. Nor can I see that Bacon\r\nis meant in the passage at the close of Albert’s _Politics_,[2118]\r\nwhere he declares that its doctrines, as in his books on physics, are\r\nnot his own theories but a faithful reflection of peripatetic opinion;\r\nand that he makes this statement for the benefit of lazy persons who\r\noccupy their idle hours in searching writings for things to criticize;\r\n“Such men killed Socrates, drove Plato from Athens to the Academy,\r\nand, plotting even against Aristotle, forced him into exile.” Such a\r\npassage seems a commonplace one. Both Adelard of Bath and William of\r\nConches expressed the same fear of setting forth new ideas of their\r\nown, and medieval writers not infrequently in their prefaces apprehend\r\nwith shrinking “the bite of envy” which both their Horace and personal\r\nexperience had taught would follow fast on publication.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Bacon’s criticism of education applies chiefly to the\r\ntraining of the friars in theology.]\r\n\r\nThirdly, while Bacon occasionally makes bitter remarks about the\r\npresent state of learning in general, it is the teaching of theology at\r\nParis and by the friars that he has most in mind and that he especially\r\ndesires to reform. Though himself a friar and master of theology,\r\nhe had been trained and had then himself specialized in the three\r\nlearned languages, Hebrew, Greek and Arabic, in optic and geometry, in\r\nastronomy and astrology, in alchemy and “experimental science,” and\r\nin the writings of the classical moralists. Consequently he thought\r\nthat no one could be a thorough theologian who did not go through the\r\nsame course of training; nay, it was enough to ruin the reputation of\r\nany supposed scholar in Bacon’s sight, if he were unacquainted with\r\nthese indispensable subjects. Bacon held that it was not sufficient\r\npreparation for theology merely to study “the common sciences, such as\r\nLatin, grammar, logic, and a part of natural philosophy, and a little\r\nmetaphysics.”[2119] However, it was not that he objected to these\r\nstudies in themselves, nor to the ordinary university instruction in\r\nthe arts course; in fact, he complains that many young friars start\r\nin to study theology at once and “presume to investigate philosophy\r\nby themselves without a teacher.”[2120] Bacon has a low opinion of the\r\nscholarship of Alexander of Hales, because his university education\r\nhad been completed before the chief authorities and commentaries in\r\nnatural philosophy and metaphysics had been translated. Against another\r\nfriar generally regarded by the academic world as its greatest living\r\nauthority Bacon brings the charge that “he never heard philosophy\r\nin the schools,” and “was not instructed nor trained in listening,\r\nreading and disputing, so that he must be ignorant of the common\r\nsciences.”[2121] Such passages show that to represent Bacon’s writings\r\nas full of “sweeping attacks” upon “the metaphysical subtleties and\r\nverbal strifes” of his age is to exaggerate his position.[2122] There\r\nare not many direct attacks upon scholastic method in his works.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: His other criticisms of contemporary education.]\r\n\r\nIt is true that Bacon complains of the lack of good teachers in his\r\nday, saying in the _Opus Minus_ that he could impart to an apt pupil in\r\nfour years all the knowledge that it had taken himself forty years to\r\nacquire,[2123] and in the _Opus Tertium_ that he could do it in a half\r\nor a quarter of a year, and that he could teach a good student all the\r\nGreek and Hebrew he need know in three days for each subject.[2124]\r\nBut aside from the young friars who presume to teach theology, the\r\nteachers against whom he rails most are those in his favorite subject\r\nof “mathematics.” Bacon could teach more useful geometry in a fortnight\r\nthan they do in ten or twenty years[2125]--a hint that much time was\r\ngiven in those days to the study of mathematics. These boasts are\r\nnot, however, as wild as they may at first seem; after all Roger did\r\nnot know a vast amount of geometry and Greek and Hebrew, and he had\r\nno intention of teaching any more of mathematics and the languages\r\nthan would be of service in his other sciences, in theology, and in\r\npractical life. He complained that “the ordinary mathematician does\r\nnot consider that he knows anything unless he demonstrates it, and so\r\nhe takes from thirty to forty years” to master the subject, and that\r\n“the text-books and the teachers of mathematics delight in multiplying\r\nconclusions to such an extent that one has to give years of unnecessary\r\ntime to extracting the essentials,” and “this is one reason why\r\nthere are so few students of a science which is a prerequisite to all\r\nknowledge.”[2126] Nor were such boasts unique in the age in which Bacon\r\nlived. Another professor and Franciscan friar, who wrote at least no\r\nlater than the early fourteenth century, Bernard of Verdun, states that\r\nhis little book on astronomy takes the place of “innumerable works and\r\nhuge tomes,” and makes it possible for anyone acquainted with geometry\r\nto learn in a short time not only the gist of books which two years\r\nof steady reading could scarce suffice to cover, but also many points\r\nwhich other books omit.[2127]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: His personal motives.]\r\n\r\nIt is easy to discern the personal motives which actuated Bacon in his\r\ncriticism. He was jealous of his more successful contemporaries and\r\ndesperately anxious to secure the pope as his patron. If, as Macaulay\r\nsaid, Francis Bacon seeking the truth was a very different person\r\nfrom Francis Bacon seeking the seals, we must remember that Roger\r\nBacon combined both attempts at once. He grieved to see the neglect by\r\nhis fellow theologians of the subjects in which he was particularly\r\ninterested, and to see himself second in reputation, influence and\r\nadvancement to the “boy theologians.” It angered him that these same\r\nnarrowly educated and narrow-minded men should “always teach against\r\nthese sciences in their lectures, sermons and conferences.”[2128] And\r\nafter all, as he tells the pope, he does not wish to revolutionize\r\nthe curriculum nor overthrow the existing educational system, “but\r\nthat from the table of the Lord, heaped with wisdom’s spoils, I, poor\r\nfellow, may gather the falling crumbs I need.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Inaccuracy of much of his criticism.]\r\n\r\nBacon’s allusions to and dates for events in the history of medieval\r\nlearning are sometimes hard to fit in with what we learn from other\r\nsources, and as we have seen he has been detected in misstatements of\r\nthe doctrines of other scholars.[2129] His personal diatribes against\r\nthe Latin translators of Greek and Arabian science seem overdrawn and\r\nunfair, especially when he condemns the first translators for not\r\nknowing the sciences in question before they ventured to translate,\r\nwhereas it is plain that the sciences could not be known to the Latin\r\nworld until the translations had been made. Indeed, it may be doubted\r\nif Roger himself knew Arabic well enough to read scientific works\r\ntherein without a translation or interpreter. Especially unjustifiable\r\nand ill advised seems his savage onslaught upon William of\r\nMoerbeke,[2130] whom we are told Aquinas induced to translate Aristotle\r\nfrom the Greek, who was like Bacon interested in occult science, and\r\nto whom Witelo dedicated his treatise on optics. As William held the\r\nconfidential post of papal chaplain and penitentiary under Clement IV,\r\nand as he became archbishop of Corinth about the time that Roger was\r\ncondemned to prison, there may have been some personal rivalry and\r\nbitterness between them.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Bacon does not regard himself as unique.]\r\n\r\nIt should be said to Bacon’s credit that his own statements do not\r\nsupport the inference which others have drawn from them, that he was\r\nalone in the advocacy or pursuit of the studies dear to him. In the\r\n_Opus Minus_ he says to the pope, with rather unusual modesty it must\r\nbe admitted, “I confess that there are several men who can present to\r\nYour Wisdom in a better way than I can these very subjects of which\r\nI treat.”[2131] And though the secrets of the arts and sciences are\r\nneglected by the crowd of students and their masters, “God always has\r\nreserved some sages who know all the necessary elements of wisdom. Not\r\nthat anyone of them knows every detail, however, nor the majority of\r\nthem; but one knows one subject, another another, so that the knowledge\r\nof such sages ought to be combined.”[2132] Combine it Bacon does for\r\nthe pope’s perusal, and he is not ashamed to speak on its behalf, for\r\nthough there are fewer Latins conversant with it than there should be,\r\nthere are many who would gladly receive it, if they were taught.[2133]\r\nThus he speaks not merely as an exponent of his own ideas, but as the\r\nrepresentative of a movement with a considerable following at least\r\noutside of strictly theological circles.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Instances of ideas which were not new with him.]\r\n\r\nBacon has been given great credit for pointing out the need of\r\ncalendar revision three centuries before the papacy achieved it; but\r\nhe says himself that not only wise astronomers but even ordinary\r\n_computistae_ were already aware of the crying need for reform,[2134]\r\nand his discussion of the calendar often coincides verbally with\r\nGrosseteste’s _Computus_.[2135] When Cardinal Pierre d’Ailly over a\r\ncentury later again urged the need of reform upon Pope John XXIII he\r\ncited Grosseteste often, but Bacon seldom or never.[2136] The Parisian\r\nversion of the Bible, against which Bacon inveighs as a corruption of\r\nthe Vulgate, was in the first instance the work of a conscientious\r\nHebrew scholar;[2137] and the numerous corrections and changes made in\r\nit since, though deplored by Bacon, show the prevalent interest in such\r\nmatters. While Bacon holds that there are very few men who understand\r\nthe theory of Greek, Hebrew and Arabic grammar, or the technique of the\r\nsciences which have to be studied from those languages, he admits that\r\nmany men are found among the “Latins” who can speak those tongues and\r\nthat there are even plenty of teachers of Greek and Hebrew at Paris and\r\nelsewhere in France and England.[2138] Thus Bacon was not so superior\r\nlinguistically to his age as he has sometimes been depicted.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Bacon and the discovery of America.]\r\n\r\nThe treatment of geography in the _Opus Maius_ is simply an intelligent\r\ncompilation of well-known past writers, including the wretched\r\nwork of Ethicus, supplemented from writings of the friars who had\r\nrecently visited the Tartars. Roger Bacon’s name has sometimes been\r\nconnected with the discovery of America by Columbus on the ground\r\nthat Columbus was greatly influenced by the _Imago mundi_ of Pierre\r\nd’Ailly and that a chapter in that work on the extent of the habitable\r\nearth was copied in large measure without acknowledgment from Roger\r\nBacon.[2139] Cardinal d’Ailly, however, can scarcely be censured\r\nfor failing to mention Bacon in this context since he does cite him\r\nelsewhere and since in this passage all that he borrows from Roger are\r\nthe statements of other writers whom Roger cites. That is, against\r\nPtolemy’s discouraging assertion that five-sixths of the earth’s\r\nsurface is covered with water he cites Aristotle, Seneca and Pliny\r\nto prove that the distance west from Spain to India is not great and\r\nthe apocryphal book of Esdras to the effect that only one-seventh\r\nof the earth’s surface is covered with water. But it is contended\r\nthat the _Imago Mundi_ was not published until 1487[2140] and that\r\nColumbus did not read it until after his first voyage in 1492,[2141]\r\nwhich is to be regarded as a continuation of the search after new\r\nislands and lands in the western ocean already undertaken by various\r\nPortuguese sailors.[2142] It is interesting to note one argument for\r\nthe propinquity of northwestern Africa to India employed by Bacon\r\nwhich d’Ailly, firm believer in astrology as he was, did not copy.\r\nBacon argues that Aristotle and his commentator included northwestern\r\nAfrica in “Spain,” “since they say as proof of the narrowness of the\r\nsea between Spain and India that there are elephants only in those two\r\nplaces.” And “Aristotle says that there cannot be elephants in those\r\nplaces unless they were of like complexion.”[2143]--i. e., under the\r\nsame constellations.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Bacon’s historical attitude.]\r\n\r\nIf in many respects Bacon’s contribution to learning has been\r\noverestimated, there is one side of his thought which has seldom been\r\nemphasized but deserves some notice, namely, his historical attitude.\r\nIn one sense history was a weak point with Bacon as with most of his\r\ncontemporaries. He not only accepted the faulty accounts of the past\r\ncurrent in his day, but was apt to pounce upon the most sensational\r\nand incredible details and use these to support his case. He had no\r\nnotion of historical criticism. Unfortunately he thought that he knew\r\na good deal about the history of philosophy, and his attitude to\r\nscience is colored by his false ideas of the history of intellectual\r\ndevelopment. He of course knew nothing of evolution or of prehistoric\r\nman. For him intellectual history commenced with a complete divine\r\nrevelation of philosophy to the patriarchs. Science then declined owing\r\nto the sinfulness of mankind, the invention of magic by Zoroaster, and\r\nfurther corruption of wisdom at the hands of Nimrod, Atlas, Prometheus,\r\nHermes Trismegistus, Aesculapius, and Apollo. Complete knowledge\r\nand understanding were granted again by God to Solomon, after whom\r\nsucceeded another period of sinful decline, until with Thales began\r\nthe gradual upbuilding of Greek philosophy culminating in Aristotle.\r\nThen night set in again, until Avicenna revived philosophy among the\r\nArabs. To him and Aristotle, however, as infidels, less complete\r\nknowledge was vouchsafed than to the representatives of God’s chosen\r\npeople.[2144] Of the composition and development of Roman law Bacon had\r\nso little notion that he thought it borrowed chiefly from Aristotle\r\nand Theophrastus, except that the Twelve Tables were derived from the\r\nlaws of Solon.[2145] Though he saw the value of linguistics and textual\r\ncriticism, and sought with true humanistic ardor for a lost work like\r\nthe _Morals_ of Seneca, he accepted as genuine works of antiquity\r\nspurious treatises like the _De Vetula_ ascribed to Ovid.[2146] He\r\nbelieved that Paul had corresponded with Seneca and that Alexander’s\r\nconquests were due to Aristotle’s experimental science. We shall\r\nsoon see how he used the astrological interpretation of history,\r\nwhich was the medieval counterpart of our geographical and economic\r\ninterpretation. Yet Bacon deserves praise for so often opening his\r\ndiscussion of a problem by an inquiry into its historical background;\r\nhe at least tried to adopt the historical point of view. And on the\r\nwhole his historical method makes about as close an approach to modern\r\nresearch as do his mathematics and experimental science to their modern\r\nparallels.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: His “mathematical method.”]\r\n\r\nYet the introduction of mathematical method into natural science has\r\noften been attributed to Roger Bacon, in which respect he has been\r\nfavorably contrasted with Francis Bacon. Therefore it will be well to\r\nnote exactly what Roger says on this point and whether his observations\r\nwere notably in advance of the thought of his times. It will be\r\nrecalled that in his criticism of the teaching of mathematics Roger had\r\nshown little appreciation of the labors of those pure mathematicians\r\nwho devoted a lifetime to painstaking demonstration and were satisfied\r\nwith nothing short of it. The discussion in the _Opus Maius_ opens\r\nwith strong assertions of the necessity for a knowledge of mathematics\r\nin the study of natural science and of theology as well; and we are\r\ntold that neglect of mathematics for the past thirty or forty years\r\nhas been the ruin of Latin learning. This position is supported by\r\ncitation of various authorities and by some vague general arguments in\r\ntypical scholastic style. Grammar and logic must employ music, a branch\r\nof mathematics, in prosody and persuasive periods. The categories of\r\ntime, place, and quantity require mathematical knowledge for their\r\ncomprehension. Mathematics must underlie other subjects because it is\r\nby nature the most elementary and the easiest to learn and the first\r\ndiscovered. Moreover, all our sense knowledge is received in space, in\r\ntime, and quantitatively. Also the certitude of mathematics makes it\r\ndesirable that other studies avail themselves of its aid.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Its crudity.]\r\n\r\nBut now we come to the application of these glittering generalities\r\nand we see what Bacon’s “mathematical method” really amounts to.\r\nBriefly, it consists in expounding his physical and astronomical\r\ntheories by means of simple geometrical diagrams. The atomical doctrine\r\nof Democritus cannot be true, since it involves the error that the\r\nhypothenuse is of the same length as the side of a square. Geometry\r\nsatisfies Roger that there can be but one universe; otherwise we\r\nshould have a vacuum left. Plato’s assertion that the heavens and\r\nfour elements are made up each of one group of regular solids is also\r\nsubjected to geometrical scrutiny. Mathematics is further of service\r\nin Biblical geography, in sacred chronology, and in allegorical\r\ninterpretation of the dimensions of the ark, temple, and tabernacle,\r\nand of various numbers which occur in Scripture. But mathematics,\r\naccording to Bacon, plays its greatest rôle in astronomy or astrology\r\nand in physics, and in his favorite theory of multiplication of species\r\nor virtues, or, as modern writers have flatteringly termed it, the\r\npropagation of force.[2147]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Its debt to others.]\r\n\r\nAstronomy and astrology had together long made up the world’s supreme\r\nscience; there was no originality in urging their importance, and\r\nunfortunately it was astrology rather than astronomy which seemed to\r\nBacon by far the most important and practical part of mathematics.\r\nIn physics he borrowed his discussion of weights and falling bodies\r\nfrom Jordanus, an earlier writer in the thirteenth century, and his\r\noptics from Alhazen and Grosseteste and from treatises which passed\r\nthen under the names of Ptolemy and Euclid but were perhaps of more\r\nrecent origin.[2148] Bacon’s graphic expression of the multiplication\r\nof species by lines and figures we find earlier in Grosseteste’s _De\r\nLineis, Angulis, et Figuris_.[2149] It does not seem, therefore, that\r\nBacon made any new suggestions of great importance concerning the\r\napplication of mathematical method in the sciences, and historians of\r\nmathematics have recognized that “he contributed nothing to the pure\r\nscience,”[2150] of whose very meaning his notion was inadequate.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. _His Experimental Science_\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Has been given undue prominence.]\r\n\r\nLet us next inquire what contributions, if any, Bacon made in the\r\ndirection of modern experimental method. Jebb’s edition of the _Opus\r\nMaius_ in 1733 ended with the sixth part on “Experimental Science,”\r\nwhich thus received undue prominence and seemed the climax of the\r\nwork. Bridges’ edition added the seventh part on “Moral Philosophy,”\r\n“a science better than all the preceding,” and the text as now extant,\r\nafter listing various arguments for the superiority of Christianity\r\nto other religions, concludes abruptly with an eight-page devout\r\njustification and glorification of the mystery of the Eucharist.\r\n\r\nOur preceding chapters have similarly rectified the place of Bacon’s\r\ndiscussion of experimental science in the history of thought. We\r\nhave already brought out the fact that he was not the first medieval\r\nman to advocate experimentation, but that writers before him contain\r\n“experiments,” rely on experience rather than mere authority, and\r\nmention the existence of other “experimenters” and “experimental\r\nbooks.” We have noted Petrus Hispanus’ discussion of “the experimental\r\nmethod” (_via experiment_), Albertus Magnus’ experimental school\r\nfor the study of nature, Robert Grosseteste’s association of\r\nexperimentation with physics, and William of Auvergne’s association\r\nof experiment with natural magic. We have described experiments of\r\nConstantinus Africanus, Adelard of Bath, Pedro Alfonso, Bernard\r\nSilvester, and many others. We have yet to describe experimental books,\r\nmany of which antedate Roger Bacon. His discussion will be found to do\r\nlittle more than duplicate and reinforce the picture of the medieval\r\nstatus of experimental method which we have already obtained from other\r\nand earlier sources. He is not a lone herald of the experimental method\r\nof modern science; he merely reveals and himself represents the merits\r\nand the defects of an important movement of his time.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: “Experimental science” distinct from other natural sciences.]\r\n\r\nBacon’s discussion of “experimental science” and of experimental method\r\nare not quite one and the same thing. He treats of “experimental\r\nscience” in a separate section of the _Opus Maius_, and seems to regard\r\nit as something distinct from his other natural sciences, such as\r\noptics, alchemy, astronomy and astrology, rather than as an inductive\r\nmethod through regulated and purposive observation and experience to\r\nthe discovery of truth, which should underlie and form an essential\r\npart of them all. Yet he also approaches the latter conception. But\r\nnote that, while the sixth part on “Experimental Science” is not\r\nthe last section of the _Opus Maius_, it is the last of the natural\r\nsciences to be discussed by him there rather than the first. It is\r\nnot, like modern experimentation, the source but “the goal of all\r\nspeculation.” It is not so much an inductive method of discovering\r\nscientific truth, as it is applied science, the putting the results of\r\nthe “speculative” natural sciences to the test of practical utility.\r\n“Other sciences know how to discover their first principles through\r\nexperience, but reach their conclusions by arguments made from the\r\nprinciples so discovered. But if they require a specific and final test\r\nof their conclusions, then they ought to avail themselves of the aid of\r\nthis noble science.”[2151] “Natural philosophy narrates and argues but\r\ndoes not experiment. The student of perspective and the astronomer put\r\nmany things to the test of experience, but not all nor sufficiently.\r\nHence complete experience is reserved for this science.”[2152] It\r\nuses the other sciences to achieve definite practical results; as a\r\nnavigator orders a carpenter to build him a ship or a knight tells a\r\nsmith to make him a suit of armor, so the _experimentator_ uses his\r\nknowledge of geometry to construct a burning-glass or outdoes alchemy\r\nat its own specialty of gold-making.[2153] In working out these\r\npractical inventions, however, the “experimenter” often happens on new\r\nfacts and truths of which the speculative sciences have not dreamed,\r\nand in this way experimental science “by its own power investigates\r\nthe secrets of nature.” Thus Bacon begins to see the advisability of a\r\nclose alliance between “experimental science” and natural science, but\r\nit is also clear that they are not yet identified. The artisans of the\r\ngilds and the alchemists--Bacon includes a discussion of alchemy in\r\nthe same sixth section with his “experimental science,” although in a\r\nway keeping the two distinct--seem to be engaging in this experimental\r\nscience more than do the scholars of the books and schools. As\r\nWilliam of Auvergne associated experimentation with magic rather than\r\nwith science, so Bacon seems to regard natural science as largely\r\nspeculative, and confirms the impression, which we have already derived\r\nfrom many other sources, that magicians were the first to “experiment,”\r\nand that “science,” originally speculative, has gradually taken\r\nover the experimental method from magic. This impression will be\r\nstrengthened as we proceed to examine in more detail, first Bacon’s\r\n“experimental science” and then what he has to say concerning magic.\r\nFrom now on, however, we shall credit Bacon with all the traces of\r\nexperimental method that we can find anywhere in his writings, as well\r\nas in his separate section on “experimental science” in the _Opus\r\nMaius_ and his further allusions to the same subject in the _Opus\r\nMinus_ and _Opus Tertium_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: As a criterion of truth.]\r\n\r\nBacon not merely emphasizes the importance of experience in arriving\r\nat the truth, but of all sciences regards his “experimental\r\nscience” as the best criterion of truth. “All sciences except this\r\neither merely employ arguments to prove their conclusions, like\r\nthe purely speculative sciences, or have universal and imperfect\r\nexperiences”;[2154] while “It alone, in truth, has the means of\r\nfinding out to perfection what can be done by nature, what by the\r\nindustry of art, what by fraud”; for it alone can distinguish what is\r\ntrue from what is false in “incantations, conjurations, invocations,\r\ndeprecations, and sacrifices.”[2155]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Lack of method.]\r\n\r\nBut how is one to set about experimenting? On this point Bacon is\r\ndisappointing. His explanation of the rainbow, which is his longest\r\nillustration of the value of experimental science, is based merely on\r\nordinary intelligent observation and reasoning, although he adds at the\r\nclose that tests with instruments are needed and that consequently he\r\nwill not assert that he has reached the full truth of the matter.[2156]\r\nElsewhere he speaks of astronomical experiments “by instruments\r\nmade for this purpose,” but seems to regard the unaided eyesight as\r\nsufficient for the investigation of terrestrial phenomena. Bacon has\r\nsent “over sea and to various other lands and to annual fairs, in order\r\nthat I might see the things of nature with my own eyes.”[2157] “And\r\nthose things which are not present in our locality we may know through\r\nother sages who have experienced them, just as Aristotle by authority\r\nof Alexander sent two thousand men to different regions to experience\r\nall things on the face of the earth, as Pliny testifies in his Natural\r\nHistory.”[2158] The one contemporary who most nearly fulfills Bacon’s\r\nideal of what an experimental scientist should be, does not spend\r\nhis time merely in reading, attending lectures, and engaging in\r\ndisputations, but “is ashamed to have some layman or old wife or knight\r\nor rustic know facts of which he is ignorant”; hence he goes out into\r\nthe world and observes the doings of common workingmen and even takes\r\nhints from the operations of witches, enchanters and magicians.[2159]\r\nBacon even accepts the notion which we have already often met in other\r\nwriters, that valuable medicines can be discovered by observing what\r\nremedies various animals employ. It would seem that experimental method\r\nis in a low state of its development, if it takes lessons from common\r\nhuman experience and from the actions of brutes. Bacon sufficiently\r\nindicates, however, that it does not consist merely of observation and\r\ncasual experience, but includes purposive experimentation, and he often\r\nspeaks of “experimenters.” Undoubtedly he himself experimented. But the\r\nfact remains that he gives no directions concerning either the proper\r\nenvironment for experimenting or the proper conduct of experiments. Of\r\nlaboratory equipment, of scientific instruments, of exact measurements,\r\nhe has no more notion apparently than his contemporaries.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Bacon and inventions.]\r\n\r\nIt cannot be shown that Roger Bacon actually anticipated any of our\r\nmodern inventions, nor that to him in particular were due any of the\r\nmedieval inventions which revolutionized domestic life such as chimney\r\nflues and window panes, or navigation such as the rudder and mariner’s\r\ncompass, or public and ecclesiastical architecture such as the pointed\r\nvault and flying buttress and stained glass, or reckoning and writing\r\nsuch as the Hindu-Arabic numerals and paper, or reading and seeing\r\nsuch as lenses and eye-glasses, or warfare such as gunpowder.[2160]\r\nWe probably are justified, however, in accepting such passages in his\r\nworks as the following, not merely as dreams that have been brought\r\ntrue by modern mechanical inventions, but as further indications that\r\nan interest existed in mechanical devices, and that men were already\r\nbeginning to struggle with the problems which have recently been solved.\r\n\r\n“Machines for navigation can be made without rowers so that the largest\r\nships on rivers or seas will be moved by a single man in charge with\r\ngreater velocity than if they were full of men. Also cars can be made\r\nso that without animals they will move with unbelievable rapidity;\r\nsuch we opine were the scythe-bearing chariots with which the men of\r\nold fought. Also flying machines can be constructed so that a man sits\r\nin the midst of the machine revolving some engine by which artificial\r\nwings are made to beat the air like a flying bird. Also a machine small\r\nin size for raising or lowering enormous weights, than which nothing\r\nis more useful in emergencies. For by a machine three fingers high and\r\nwide and of less size a man could free himself and his friends from\r\nall danger of prison and rise and descend. Also a machine can easily\r\nbe made by which one man can draw a thousand to himself by violence\r\nagainst their wills, and attract other things in like manner. Also\r\nmachines can be made for walking in the sea and rivers, even to the\r\nbottom without danger. For Alexander the Great employed such, that he\r\nmight see the secrets of the deep, as Ethicus the astronomer tells.\r\nThese machines were made in antiquity and they have certainly been made\r\nin our times, except possibly a flying machine which I have not seen\r\nnor do I know any one who has, but I know an expert who has thought out\r\nthe way to make one. And such things can be made almost without limit,\r\nfor instance, bridges across rivers without piers or other supports,\r\nand mechanisms, and unheard of engines.”[2161] Since Bacon’s authority\r\nconcerning Alexander is unreliable and his conjectures concerning\r\nancient scythe-bearing chariots unwarranted, we may also doubt if\r\nsteamboats and automobiles had “certainly been made” in his day; but\r\nmen may have been trying to accomplish such things.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Marvelous results expected.]\r\n\r\nBacon says far more of the marvelous results which he expects\r\nexperimental science to achieve than he does of the methods by which\r\nsuch results are to be attained. In the main marvelousness rather than\r\npracticability characterizes the aims which he proposes for _scientia\r\nexperimentalis_. Indeed, of the three ways in which he represents it\r\nas superior to all other sciences, while one is that it employs sure\r\nproofs rather than mere arguments, two are that by it life may be\r\ngreatly lengthened, and that from it a better knowledge of the future\r\nmay be gained than even from astrology.[2162] Thus experimental method\r\nis especially connected with alchemy and astrology. Bacon declares that\r\n“it has been proved by certain experiments” that life can be greatly\r\nprolonged “by secret experiences.”[2163] and he believes that Artephius\r\nwas enabled by such methods to live for a thousand and twenty-five\r\nyears.[2164] Or experimental science may predict the weather by\r\nobserving the behavior of animals.[2165]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fantastic “experiments.”]\r\n\r\nSome of Bacon’s “experiments” are as fantastic as the aims are\r\nmarvelous. “A good experimenter says in the book _De regimine senum_”\r\nthat the following elixir will greatly prolong life: “that which is\r\ntemperate in the fourth degree, and what swims in the sea, and what\r\ngrows in the air, and what is cast up by the sea, and plant of India,\r\nand what is found in the entrails of an animal of long life, and\r\nthose two serpents which are the food of the inhabitants of Tyre and\r\nEthiopia.”[2166] We also are told that “at Paris recently there was\r\na sage who asked for snakes and was given one and cut it into small\r\nsections except that the skin of its belly on which it crawled remained\r\nintact; and that snake crawled as best it could to a certain herb\r\nby touching which it was instantly made whole. And the experimenter\r\ncollected an herb of wonderful virtue.”[2167]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Credulity essential.]\r\n\r\nCredulity, in contrast to the sceptical attitude of modern science\r\nis a characteristic of Bacon’s experimental method. He declares, it\r\nis true, that experiment disproves many false notions such as that\r\nhot water freezes faster than cold, that adamant can be broken only\r\nwith the blood of a goat, and that the beaver when hunted castrates\r\nitself to save its life;[2168] but we have already heard such beliefs\r\nquestioned by Albertus Magnus and others. On the other hand, Bacon\r\nasserts that credulity is necessary to experimentation. “First one\r\nshould be credulous until experience follows second and reason comes\r\nthird.... At first one should believe those who have made experiments\r\nor who have faithful testimony from others who have done so, nor should\r\none reject the truth because he is ignorant of it and because he has\r\nno argument for it.”[2169] Taken as a plea for an open-minded attitude\r\ntoward scientific investigation on the part of the ordinary man and\r\nof the ecclesiastical authorities, this utterance may be commended;\r\nbut as a prescription for the scientific investigator it is dangerous.\r\nMany of Bacon’s “experiments” are copied from books, and the reproach\r\nmade against the Greek Empirics that they followed tradition, applies\r\nalso to him. Describing a certain marvel of nature, he exclaims,\r\n“After I beheld this, there was nothing difficult for my mind to\r\nbelieve, provided it had a reliable author.”[2170] In the midst of his\r\ndiscussion of experimental science we encounter the following instance\r\nof his gullibility:\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Good flying dragons.]\r\n\r\n“It is certain that Ethiopian sages have come into Italy, Spain,\r\nFrance, England, and those Christian lands where there are good flying\r\ndragons; and by an occult art that they possess, excite the dragons\r\nfrom their caves. And they have saddles and bridles ready, and they\r\nride the dragons, and drive them at top speed through the air, in\r\norder to soften the rigidity and toughness of their flesh, just as\r\nboars, bears, and bulls are hunted with dogs and beaten with many\r\nblows before they are killed for eating. And when they have tamed\r\nthe dragons in this way, they have an art of preparing their flesh\r\n... which they employ against the accidents of age and prolong life\r\nand inspire the intellect beyond all estimation. For no education\r\nwhich man can give will bestow such wisdom as does the eating of their\r\nflesh, as we have learned without deceit or doubt from men of proved\r\ntrustworthiness.”[2171]\r\n\r\nBacon’s discussion of experimental science, therefore, on its positive\r\nside amounts to little more than a recognition of experience as a\r\ncriterion of truth and a promulgation of the phrase “Experimental\r\nscience” which, however, he himself ascribes to Ptolemy.[2172]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Experiment and magic.]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the credulity, the superstition, the element of\r\nmarvelousness, which seem to vitiate the experimental tendencies of\r\nBacon, are to be explained as the result of a real connection between\r\nexperiment and magic. There is abundant evidence for this. Bacon, it\r\nis true, asserts that experimental science exposes and shuns all the\r\nfollies of the magicians, but he admits that many persons confuse\r\nit with magic because of the marvels which it works, and he himself\r\nespecially associates it with the occult sciences of alchemy and\r\nastrology. It makes gold such as neither the art of alchemy nor nature\r\ncan produce; it can predict the future better than astrology.[2173] It\r\nteaches one to choose the proper constellations for his undertakings,\r\nand to use the right words at the proper times;[2174] it can construct\r\n“philosophical images and incantations and characters” which are vastly\r\nsuperior to those of magic;[2175] it can alter the world about us,\r\nand incline and excite the human will, though without coercion.[2176]\r\nMoreover, Bacon’s ideal experimental scientist does not scorn to\r\ntake hints from wizards, while Roger himself derives his hazel rod\r\nexperiment from the magicians. The snake experiment of his sage at\r\nParis sounds more like the trick of a Hindu conjurer than the procedure\r\nof a modern laboratory.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. _His Attitude Toward Magic and Astrology_\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Magic and astrology.]\r\n\r\nThus we are finally led to a consideration of the magic and astrology\r\nwhich were evidently so closely connected with Bacon’s mathematics and\r\nexperimental science. Roger admits a certain connection between magic\r\nand astrology, since he adopts Hugh of St. Victor’s fivefold division\r\nof magic into _mantice_, _mathematica_, _sortilegium_, _praestigium_\r\nand _maleficium_.[2177] However, except for this superstitious\r\n_mathematica_ he approves of astrology, whereas his attitude towards\r\nmagic is uniformly one of condemnation and contempt. We shall therefore\r\ntake up his treatments of the two subjects separately.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Magic in the past.]\r\n\r\nBacon discusses or alludes to “magic” in a number of passages scattered\r\nthrough his works, and to it is more particularly devoted the “Letter\r\non the secret works of art and nature and the nullity of magic,”\r\na treatise which faithfully reproduces his point of view whether\r\nactually penned by him as it stands or not.[2178] Bacon had evidently\r\nread a good deal about magic and gives a rather unusual account of\r\nits position in the Roman Empire and early Christian period, but one\r\nwhich is not so very far from the truth. His idea is that there were\r\nthree great conflicting and contending forces in the early centuries\r\nof the Christian era, namely, Christianity, philosophy, and magic,\r\nand that each one of these was then in opposition to the other two,\r\nalthough there was no sufficient reason for the permanent hostility\r\nof Christianity and philosophy, which have since become allies.[2179]\r\nBut at the time the result was that the philosophers often accused the\r\nChristians of practicing magic, and that the early Christians similarly\r\nconfused philosophers with magicians, as indeed was often done by\r\nuneducated men of the time who were not Christians. Moreover, Bacon\r\ncomplains that this confusion still exists in his own time and that\r\ncontemporary theologians, Gratian in his work on Canon law, and “many\r\nsaints” have condemned many useful and splendid sciences along with\r\nmagic.[2180]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Magicians and their books still prevalent.]\r\n\r\nRoger himself, however, not only regards magic as rife in antiquity,\r\nbut as still prevalent in his own time. He often refers to contemporary\r\nmagicians and witches, old-wives and wizards. He declares that every\r\nnation is full of their superstitions.[2181] He is another medieval\r\nwitness to the currency of a considerable body of occult literature,\r\nof which he speaks especially in the second and third chapters of\r\nthe _Epistola de secretis operibus_, and again in his commentary on\r\n_The Secret of Secrets_. “Books of the magicians” are in circulation\r\nwhich are falsely attributed to Solomon and the ancient philosophers\r\nand which “assume a grand-sounding style,” but which “ought all to be\r\nprohibited by law, since they abound in so many lies that one cannot\r\ndistinguish the true from the false.”[2182] Such works as _De officiis\r\nspirituum_, _De morte animae_, and _De arte notoria_ embody only\r\n“figments of the magicians.” Yet these books of false _mathematici_ and\r\ndemons, ascribed to Adam, Moses, Solomon, Aristotle, and Hermes, have\r\nseduced not only youths but mature and famous men of Bacon’s own time.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Magic a delusion.]\r\n\r\nBacon, indeed, despite the prevalence of magic both in antiquity and\r\nin his own time, regards it as essentially a delusion. It is “the\r\nnullity of magic” that he especially attempts to demonstrate both in\r\nthe _Epistola de secretis operibus_ and elsewhere in his works. He is\r\nmedieval Christian enough, it is true, to grant that magic may perform\r\nmarvels by the aid of demons.[2183] But he also accepts the orthodox\r\nbelief that magicians cannot coerce the demons by their invocations,\r\nsacrifices, and employment of the properties of natural objects, and\r\nthat the evil spirits in reality respond only with evil intent and\r\nas God permits.[2184] But his emphasis is not, like Augustine’s upon\r\nthe “host of wonders” which magicians work by demon aid. He seems to\r\nbe sounding, not a religious retreat from magic, but a rational and\r\nscientific attack upon it. Nor does he dwell much on the criminal\r\ncharacter of magic, although he calls the magicians _maledicti_--“of\r\nevil repute.”[2185] What impresses him most about magic, and the charge\r\nwhich he most often brings against it, is its fraud and futility. Twice\r\nhe speaks of things as “false and magical”;[2186] he mentions the\r\n“figments of the magicians”;[2187] and associates magic and necromancy,\r\nnot like Albert with astronomy, but with deception.[2188] For him\r\nmagicians are neither _magni_ nor philosophers and astronomers; in half\r\na dozen passages he classes them with old-wives and witches.[2189] He\r\nwill not admit that they employ valid natural forces. He represents\r\nmagic as using sleight-of-hand, ventriloquism, subtle mechanism,\r\ndarkness and confederates to simulate results which it is unable\r\nto perform.[2190] He further represents the magicians as “stupidly\r\ntrusting in characters and incantations,”[2191] and affirms that “the\r\nhuman voice has not that power which magicians imagine it has.”[2192]\r\nWhen words are employed in magic, “either the magician accomplishes\r\nnothing, or the devil is the author of the feat.”[2193] Magical\r\nincantations and formulae are made haphazard and at anyone’s pleasure;\r\nthey therefore possess no natural transforming power, and if they\r\nseem to effect anything, this is really the work of demons.[2194]\r\nSimilarly Bacon regards as worthless the assertion of the magicians\r\nand witches that sudden transformations may be produced by any man at\r\nany time of day.[2195] He dismisses “fascination by word alone uttered\r\nat haphazard” as “a stupid notion characteristic of magic and of\r\nold-wives and beneath the notice of philosophers.” Here again nothing\r\nis accomplished, “unless the devil because of men’s sins operates\r\nunbeknownst.”[2196]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Some truth in magic.]\r\n\r\nIn certain passages, however, Bacon suggests that magic is not utterly\r\nworthless and that some truth may be derived from it. The experimental\r\nscientist whom he most admired “investigated even the _experiments_ and\r\nlot-castings of old women”--note that they too were experimenters--“and\r\ntheir charms and those of all the magicians, and likewise the illusions\r\nand devices of all the conjurers”; and he did so not merely that he\r\nmight be able to expose their deceptions, but also “so that nothing\r\nthat ought to be known might escape him.”[2197] And his experimental\r\nscience not merely “considered all the follies of the magicians, not\r\nto confirm them but to shun them, just as logic deals with sophistry”;\r\nbut also “so that all falsity may be removed and the truth of the\r\nart alone retained.”[2198] Roger himself in the case of the split\r\nhazel rod discovered a natural phenomenon concealed by use of a magic\r\nincantation. Bacon also granted that the books of the magicians “may\r\ncontain some truth.”[2199] It also was apparently very difficult to\r\ndistinguish them from other writings, since he states that many books\r\nare reputed magical which are nothing of the sort but contain sound\r\nlearning;[2200] since he calls the magicians “corrupters of wisdom’s\r\nrecords,”[2201] and charges them not only with fraudulently ascribing\r\nvarious “enormities” to Solomon, but with misinterpreting and abusing\r\n“enigmatical writings” which he believes Solomon really wrote;[2202]\r\nand since he tells us that even true philosophers have sometimes made\r\nuse of meaningless incantations and characters in order to conceal\r\ntheir meaning. He consequently concludes that experience will show\r\nwhich books are good and which are bad, and that “if anyone finds the\r\nwork of nature and art in one of them, let him receive it; if not,\r\nabandon the book as open to suspicion.”[2203]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Magic and science.]\r\n\r\nIndeed, Bacon seems to think that magic has taken such a hold upon men\r\nthat it can be uprooted only by scientific exposition of its tricks and\r\nby scientific achievement of even greater marvels than it professes to\r\nperform. Perhaps he realizes that religious censure or rationalistic\r\nargument is not enough to turn men from these alluring arts, but that\r\nscience must show unto them yet a more excellent way, and afford\r\nscope for that laudable curiosity, that inventive and exploring\r\ninstinct which magic pretends to gratify. He waxes enthusiastic over\r\n“the secret works of art and nature,” and contends that the wonders\r\nof nature and the possibilities of applied science far outshine the\r\nfeats of magicians.[2204] One reason why early Christian writers so\r\noften confounded philosophy and magic together was, in his opinion,\r\nthat the philosophers by their marvelous exploitation of the forces of\r\nnature equalled both the illusions of magic and the miracles of the\r\nChristians.[2205] Science, in short, not merely attacks magic’s front;\r\nit can turn its flank and cut it off from its base of supplies.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: His belief in marvelous “extraneous virtues.”]\r\n\r\nBut Bacon’s science is sometimes occult science. In the first place he\r\nshared the common belief of his time that “herbs and stones and metals\r\nand other things” possess “almost miraculous” powers.[2206] By thorough\r\ninvestigation of such occult virtues Artephius prolonged his existence\r\nto one thousand and twenty-five years. “Moreover, there are numerous\r\nthings which kill every venomous animal by the slightest contact; and\r\nif a circle is drawn about such animals with objects of this sort, they\r\ncannot get out but die without having been touched. And if a man is\r\nstung by a venomous animal, he can be cured by a little powder scraped\r\nfrom such objects, as Bede writes in his _Ecclesiastical History_ and\r\nas we know by experience. And so there are innumerable things which\r\nhave extraneous virtues of this sort, of whose powers we are ignorant\r\nfrom mere neglect of experimentation.”[2207] By calling such virtues\r\n“extraneous” Bacon seems to imply that they cannot be accounted for\r\nby the properties of the elements composing the objects, and perhaps\r\nfurther that they are of celestial origin. This points on to his belief\r\nin astrology.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Non-magical fascination.]\r\n\r\nBut Bacon goes farther than that, for some of his “secret works of\r\nart and nature” we must regard as plain cases of magic procedure,\r\nand they would indeed be so classified by most of our authors. Bacon\r\nreally goes about as far as Albertus Magnus in credulous acceptance of\r\nsuperstition, but will not admit, as Albert does, that such things are\r\nmagic or very closely related to it. The incantations and characters,\r\nthe fascination and marvelous transformations of magic Bacon condemns,\r\nbut he does not condemn all incantations and characters, nor disbelieve\r\nin marvelous transformations and fascination. While he regards\r\nhaphazard fascination as magic, he holds that just as certain bodily\r\ndiseases are contagious, so if some malignant soul thinks hard of\r\ninfecting another, and desires this ardently, and has full confidence\r\nin its own power to inflict such injury, “there is no doubt that nature\r\nwill obey thought, as Avicenna”--who seems to have been the leading\r\nmedieval authority on the subject of fascination--“shows in his eighth\r\nbook on animals and in his fourth book on the soul: ... and this much\r\nis not magic.”[2208]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The power of words.]\r\n\r\nBacon makes a close connection between fascination and the power of\r\nwords and of the human voice, since in his opinion both are largely due\r\nto the rational soul. Words are the soul’s most appropriate instrument\r\nand almost every miracle since the beginning of the world has been\r\nperformed by using them.[2209] “For where the attention, desire and\r\nvirtue of the rational soul, which is worthier than the stars, concur\r\nwith the power of the sky, it is inevitable that either a word or some\r\nother instrument of marvelous power be produced which will alter the\r\nthings of this world, so that not only natural objects but also souls\r\nwill be inclined to those ends which the wise operator desires.”[2210]\r\nAgain in the _Opus Tertium_ we are told that, while the magician\r\naccomplishes nothing by words, the wise man may for this reason.\r\n“When words are uttered with deep thought and great desire and good\r\nintention and firm confidence, they have great virtue. For when these\r\nfour qualities unite, the substance of the rational being is strongly\r\nexcited to radiate its own species and virtues from itself into its own\r\nbody and foreign matter.”[2211] The rational soul influences the voice,\r\nwhich in turn affects the atmosphere and all objects contained therein.\r\nThe physical constitution of the speaker also has some influence,\r\nand finally the positions of the stars must by all means be taken\r\ninto account.[2212] All this reasoning is equivalent to accepting the\r\npower of incantations, for as Bacon states, “They are words brought\r\nforth by the exertion of the rational soul, and receive the virtue of\r\nthe sky as they are pronounced.”[2213] Through their power bodies\r\nare healed, venomous animals put to flight, and other such effects\r\nproduced. If incantations are made as described above, “then they are\r\nphilosophical and the work of a sage wisely enchanting, as David the\r\nprophet says.”[2214] Bacon, however, recognizes that he is dealing\r\nwith a delicate matter in which it is hard to distinguish between\r\nphilosophy and magic.[2215] Of his further discussion of characters\r\nand images, and effort to show that they need not be magical, we shall\r\ntreat presently in connection with his astrology. In his introduction\r\nto _The Secret of Secrets_ he holds that the prayers and sacrifices of\r\nAristotle and other philosophers were licit and not idolatrous.[2216]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Magic and science again.]\r\n\r\nThus Bacon fails in his attempt to draw the line between science and\r\nmagic, and shows, as William of Auvergne, Albertus Magnus, and others\r\nhave already shown, how inextricably the two subjects were intertwined\r\nin his time. His own science still clings to many occult and magical\r\ntheories and practices, while he admits that the magicians often try\r\nor pretend to use scientific books and methods, and that it is no\r\neasy matter to tell which books and characters and images are which.\r\nThe experimental scientist not only exposes the frauds of magic but\r\ndiscovers secrets of nature hidden beneath the husk of magical ceremony\r\nand pretense. Also some men employ the marvels of philosophy for wicked\r\nends and so pervert it into a sort of magic. Finally in one passage\r\nhe forgets himself and speaks of “those magnificent sciences” which\r\nproperly employ “images, characters, charms, prayers, and deprecations”\r\nas “magical sciences.”[2217]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The multiplication of species.]\r\n\r\nBacon’s doctrine of the multiplication of species is a good\r\nillustration of the combination of magic and science which we encounter\r\nin his works. This theory has been praised by his admirers as the\r\npropagation of force subject to mathematical law; and he has been\r\ncommended for describing the species which every agent causes in all\r\ndirections not, like the idols of Lucretius, as material films which\r\npeel off from the agent and impress themselves on surrounding matter,\r\nbut as successive effects produced in that matter. Bacon usually\r\nillustrates his theory by the radiation of light from the sun, and by\r\na discussion of the geometrical laws of reflection and refraction;\r\nthus his theory seems at first sight a physical one. He believed,\r\nhowever, that the occult influences of the planets upon nature and man\r\nwere exercised in the same way, and also such mysterious powers as\r\nthose of the evil eye and of fascination. Indeed, he asserts that this\r\nmultiplication of virtues is universal, and that spiritual beings as\r\nwell as corporeal objects affect in this manner everything about them\r\nand may themselves be so affected by other objects and beings.[2218]\r\nViewed from this angle, his theory seems a magical one of occult\r\ninfluence, though given a scientific guise by its assumption that such\r\nforces proceed along mathematical lines after the analogy of rays\r\nof light. This suggests that it is not fair merely to call Bacon’s\r\nscience superstitious; we must also note that he tries to make his\r\nmagic scientific. But finally we must note that this doctrine was not\r\noriginal with Bacon; we have already met with it in Alkindi’s work on\r\nstellar rays.[2219]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: William of St. Cloud on works of art and nature compared to\r\nmagic.]\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to find Bacon’s belief that the works of art and\r\nnature can exceed those of magic, and his charge that unscientific\r\npersons are confusing such works with magic, repeated by another\r\nwriter. William of St. Cloud composed astronomical tables based upon\r\nhis own observations during the period from about 1285 to 1321, in\r\nwhich he detected errors in the earlier tables of Thebit, Toulouse, and\r\nToledo. This experimental astronomer, speaking of the powers of mirrors\r\nand lenses, such as those of Archimedes, those by which Caesar saw\r\nBritain from the shores of Gaul, and that by which Socrates discovered\r\na dragon in the air, says: “These marvels and many others have been\r\nperformed in ancient times, not by magic art, as some would have it,\r\nwho are ignorant of the secrets of nature and of scientific industry,\r\nbut solely by the force of nature and the aid of art.”[2220]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The two mathematics.]\r\n\r\nWe now turn to Bacon’s attitude towards astrology, which we have\r\nalready seen was an important factor in his “secret works of art\r\nand nature” as well as in his mathematics. He was aware that the\r\n_mathematici_ or astrologers of the Roman Empire had been condemned\r\nby some of the church fathers, and were classed as practitioners\r\nof magic by more recent theologians and writers on Canon law. Like\r\nIsidore, Albertus Magnus, and other authors whom we have already\r\ndiscussed, Bacon gets around this by distinguishing two varieties of\r\nmathematics, one of which he says is magic, condemned by Cicero in his\r\n_De divinatione_ and by other classical authorities as well as by the\r\nchurch fathers, the other a department of philosophy, a branch of which\r\nAugustine, Ambrose, Basil, Cassiodorus, and Gregory all approved. In\r\nthe _Opus Maius_ and _Opus Tertium_ he states as usual that the “e”\r\nis long in the magical art of divination, while the vowel is short in\r\nthe philosophical study; but in other writings he changed his mind and\r\ndeclared that “all the Latins” were wrong in this opinion and that the\r\ndistinction was just the opposite.[2221] Bacon also cites Isidore’s\r\ndistinction between two kinds of “astronomy”; one natural science, the\r\nother superstitious. Roger himself sometimes uses the words “astrology”\r\nand “astronomy” indifferently; sometimes speaks of “astrology” as\r\nspeculative and “astronomy” as practical; sometimes distinguishes\r\nbetween speculative and practical astrology, of which the last includes\r\njudicial astrology.[2222]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Four objections to the forbidden variety.]\r\n\r\nFour features, to Bacon’s mind, distinguish the forbidden _mathematica_\r\nfrom legitimate judicial astrology.[2223] In the first place, it\r\nascribes fatal necessity to the influence of the stars, whereas Bacon\r\nshows by an examination of the writings of Haly, Ptolemy, Avicenna,\r\nMessahala, and Isaac that learned and legitimate astrologers have\r\nnever held any such tenet as fatal necessity, although common report\r\nmay ignorantly ascribe such doctrine to them.[2224] In the second\r\nplace, the practitioners of the magical variety of mathematics “invoke\r\ndemons by conjurations and sacrifices to supplement the influence of\r\nthe constellations, an execrable practice.” Third, “they mar their\r\nastrological observations by the idlest sort of circles, figures,\r\nand characters, and by the stupidest incantations and unreasonable\r\nprayers in which they put their trust.” Finally they often resort to\r\nfraud, employing confederates, darkness, deceptive mechanisms, and\r\nsleight-of-hand. By such methods “in which they know there is illusion”\r\nand “in which there is no virtue of the sky operating,” “they perform\r\nmany feats which seem marvelous to the stupid.”[2225]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The rule of the stars.]\r\n\r\nWhile thus censuring the _mathematica_ which is a subdivision of magic,\r\nBacon declared that “it is manifest to everyone that the celestial\r\nbodies are the causes of generation and corruption in all inferior\r\nthings.”[2226] Had not Aristotle in his treatise on Generation and\r\nCorruption said that the four terrestrial elements are related to the\r\nheavens as tools to an artificer?[2227] Bacon regarded the stars as\r\nungenerated, incorruptible, and voluntary in their movements, which\r\nwere regulated by angelic intelligences.[2228] He also accepted the\r\nusual technique of the astrological art in explaining the operation of\r\nthis celestial influence.[2229]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Astrological medicine.]\r\n\r\nBacon naturally subjected the human body to the constellations and was\r\na firm believer in astrological medicine. If a doctor is ignorant of\r\n“astronomy,” his medical treatment will be dependent upon “chance and\r\nfortune.”[2230] Bacon holds not only that at conception and at birth\r\none’s fundamental “complexion,” or physical constitution, is determined\r\nby the sky,[2231] but that with each changing hour our bodies are\r\ngoverned by a different planet whose characteristics the physician\r\nshould know. Where Neckam[2232] had assigned six hours to the planet\r\nafter which the day was named, that is, the first three and last three\r\nhours of the twenty-four, Bacon assigns it only four hours, namely, the\r\nfirst, eighth, fifteenth and twenty-second. Then, in order to bring the\r\nproper planet into control of the first hour of the succeeding day, he\r\nis obliged to have them follow each other in a different order in their\r\nrule of hours from that in which the days of the week are named.[2233]\r\nBacon also distributes the parts of the body among the signs of the\r\nzodiac,[2234] and states that the physician must observe the moon\r\ncarefully.[2235] He cites Hippocrates, Galen, the _Centiloquium_ and\r\nHaly concerning the great influence of the stars both upon health and\r\nthe administering of medicines.[2236] That the patriarchs of the Old\r\nTestament lived so much longer than men do to-day has been explained by\r\nmany, Bacon says, as due to the stars. His explanation of the strange\r\ncase of a woman of Norwich who ate nothing for twenty years and yet was\r\nduring all that time in the best of health is that some constellation\r\nmust have reduced the concourse of the four elements in her body to a\r\nself-sufficient harmony such as they seldom attain.[2237] Indeed, he\r\ngoes so far as to hold that the resurrected body will have that harmony\r\nof the elements and so endure through eternity, no matter whether\r\nraised to the bliss of heaven or subjected to the consuming torments of\r\nhell.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Influence of the stars upon human conduct.]\r\n\r\nBacon even held that the stars by their influence upon the human body\r\nincline men to bad acts and evil arts or to good conduct and useful\r\nsciences. Such natural inclinations might, however, be resisted by\r\neffort of will, modified by divine grace, or strengthened by diabolic\r\ntempting.[2238] But while the individual by an effort of will may\r\nresist the force of the stars, in masses of men the power of the\r\nconstellations usually prevails; and the differences in peoples\r\ninhabiting different parts of the earth are due to their being under\r\ndifferent aspects of the sky. Recent bloody wars might have been\r\navoided, had men harkened to warnings written in the sky. “Oh, how\r\ngreat profit to the church of God might have been procured, if the\r\ndisposition of the sky for those times had been foreseen by the wise,\r\nand known to prelates and princes, and restricted by zeal for peace!\r\nThen there would not have been such slaughter of Christians nor so many\r\nsouls sent below.”[2239] The personality of the king, too, has such\r\ngreat influence upon his kingdom that it is worth while to examine his\r\nhoroscope carefully.[2240]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Planetary conjunctions and religious movements.]\r\n\r\nBacon was especially attracted by the doctrine of Albumasar concerning\r\nconjunctions of the planets, and derived comforting evidence of\r\nthe superiority of the Christian faith to other religions from the\r\nastrological explanation of the origin of religious sects according to\r\nthe successive conjunctions of the other planets with Jupiter.[2241]\r\nHe was pleased by the association of Christianity with Mercury, which\r\nhe calls the lord of wisdom and eloquence, of oracles and prophecies;\r\nit is dominant only in the sign Virgo, which at once suggests the\r\nVirgin Mary; and its orbit, difficult to trace because of epicycle and\r\neccentric, typifies well the Christian creed with its mysteries that\r\ndefy reason. Similarly the malign force of the moon, productive of\r\nnecromancy and magic, fits Antichrist exactly; and Venus corresponds\r\nto the sensuality of Mohammedanism. Further astrological evidences\r\nof Christianity are the coincidence six years before the birth of\r\nChrist of an important conjunction of Saturn and Jupiter with a tenth\r\nrevolution of Saturn, which last occurs only at intervals of 320\r\nyears, and always marks some great historical change like the advent\r\nof Alexander or Manes or Mohammed. Astrology further assures us that\r\nIslam can endure only 693 years, a prediction in close agreement with\r\nthe number of the beast in the Apocalypse, 663 (_sic_); the small\r\ndiscrepancy of thirty years is readily accounted for by the dictum of\r\nthe venerable Bede that “Scripture in many places subtracts something\r\nfrom the complete number, for that’s the way with Scripture.”[2242]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Was Christ born under the stars?]\r\n\r\nThe astronomers, Bacon tells the pope, further assure us that even\r\nthe Virgin Birth of Christ and His Nativity were in accordance with\r\nthe constellations. They think that God willed so to order His works\r\nthat certain future events which He foresaw or predestined should be\r\nrevealed to the wise through the planets, in order that the human\r\nmind, recognizing God’s marvelous works, might increase in love\r\ntowards Him. They grant that it is impossible that the Creator be\r\nsubject to a creature, or that the birth of Christ, in so far as it\r\nwas supernatural, should be subject in any way to the influence of\r\nthe stars, which in this respect could only be signs of the divine\r\nwork. But in so far as the birth of Jesus was a natural event and\r\nHis nature was human, they regard Him as under the influence of the\r\nconstellations, like the rest of humanity. Their statements in such\r\nmatters should, however, Bacon more cautiously adds, be brought into\r\nconformity with the doctrines of the Catholic faith.[2243]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Operative astrology.]\r\n\r\nBacon believed that by means of astrology not only could the future\r\nbe in large measure foretold, but also marvelous operations and\r\ngreat alterations could be effected throughout the whole world,\r\nespecially by choosing favorable hours and by employing astronomical\r\namulets and characters--in other words, by the arts of elections and\r\nof images.[2244] As the babe at birth receives from the stars that\r\nfundamental physical constitution which lasts it through life, so any\r\nnew-made object is permanently affected by the disposition of the\r\nconstellations at the moment of its making.[2245] Especially by images,\r\n“if they are engraved in accordance with the aspect of the sky in the\r\nelect times, can all injuries be repelled and useful undertakings\r\npromoted.”[2246] Bacon not only cites as authorities concerning them\r\nHaly’s commentary on the _Centiloquium_ supposed to be by Ptolemy,\r\nThabit ben Corra, and the spurious _Secret of Secrets_ of Aristotle;\r\nbut believes that Moses and Solomon both made use of them.[2247] The\r\nmarvelous power of spoken words is also in part accounted for by Bacon\r\nby the celestial influence prevalent at the moment of utterance.\r\n“Although the efficacious employment of words is primarily the function\r\nof the rational soul,” nevertheless “the astronomer can form words\r\nin elect times which will possess unspeakable power” of transforming\r\nnatural objects and even inclining human minds to obey him.[2248] Thus\r\nBacon’s “astronomer” is really a magician and enchanter as well--one\r\nmore of the many indications we have met that there is no dividing line\r\nbetween magic and astrology: divination is magic; astrology operates.\r\nBacon was very desirous that the church should avail itself of the\r\nguidance and aid of astrology; and he feared the harm that Antichrist,\r\nwhose advent Bacon with many others of his century seems to have\r\nbelieved was near at hand, or the Tartars with their astrologers, would\r\nbe able to do Christendom, if the church neglected this art.[2249]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Unlikelihood that Bacon was condemned for magic or\r\nastrology.]\r\n\r\nHaving considered Bacon’s position in regard to magic and astrology,\r\nwe are now prepared to inquire what likelihood there is that his\r\nreported condemnation in 1278 for “some suspected novelties” was due\r\nto either. Briefly it may be answered to begin with that his views\r\nconcerning these subjects were not novel; he shared them with Albert\r\nand other contemporaries, and there seems to be no good reason why\r\nthey should have got him into trouble. His expressed attitude towards\r\n“magic” is so hostile that it seems unlikely that he would have been\r\ncharged with it, when other clergymen like Albert and William of\r\nAuvergne spoke of it with less hostility and yet escaped unscathed.\r\nThere is not a particle of evidence in his works that he ever invoked\r\nspirits or attempted to do anyone an injury by occult methods, and\r\nthis was the only kind of magic that was likely to be punished at that\r\ntime.[2250] Towards astrology he was, it is true, more favorable than\r\nsome of his contemporaries. With his views on astrological images and\r\nhis attribution of religious sects to conjunctions of the planets\r\ntheologians like Aquinas and William of Auvergne would refuse to agree,\r\nbut Arabian astrology supported such doctrines, and the views of an\r\napproved Christian thinker like Albertus Magnus concerning astrology\r\nare almost identical with those of Bacon. We note elsewhere writings\r\non such subjects as astrological medicine by Franciscans; and such a\r\nregulation as that of May 25, 1292, for Franciscans studying at Paris,\r\nthat they should not spend the alms given them to buy books with for\r\nother purposes, nor cause curious books to be made, suggests that a\r\nnumber of them were prone to consult superstitious works as well as\r\nthat the Order forbids this.[2251] And by “curious books” are doubtless\r\nmeant the sort that we have heard Bacon strongly censure.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Error of Charles in thinking that any stigma rested on\r\nBacon’s memory]\r\n\r\nAgain therefore there is no reason why Bacon should have been\r\nsingled out for condemnation. Such a notion has arisen partly from\r\nmisapprehension as to the views of Bacon’s contemporaries and from\r\nmisstatements such as the passage in Charles’ life of Bacon,[2252]\r\nwhere he declares that Cardinal Pierre d’Ailly in his treatise on\r\nlaws and sects condemns the doctrine of an English doctor concerning\r\nreligions and the conjunctions of planets, and approves the contrary\r\ndoctrine of William of Auvergne, but “does not dare” to name Bacon, to\r\nwhom he alludes with the bated breath of terror and repugnance. All\r\nthis, except the bare fact that d’Ailly criticizes this particular\r\ndoctrine of Bacon, is sheer fancy on Charles’ part. Had he consulted\r\na complete fifteenth-century edition of d’Ailly’s writings instead of\r\nmerely such of his treatises as were included in an eighteenth-century\r\nedition of the works of Gerson, he would have known that elsewhere\r\nthe cardinal cites Bacon on astrology by name with respect and\r\nadmiration,[2253] and that the learned reformer even goes so far as\r\nto agree boldly and explicitly with Bacon’s doctrine that Christ as\r\na son of man was under the stars.[2254] That Bacon’s astrology had\r\nnot been condemned in 1278 is also indicated soon after his death by\r\nPierre Dubois’ approving mention of his discussion of the utility of\r\n“mathematics.”[2255]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: But his own statements may have caused the legend.]\r\n\r\nIt must be added, however, that there are passages in Bacon’s own\r\nwritings which are perhaps also partly responsible for the growth\r\nof the idea that he was condemned for magic or astrology. Briefly,\r\nthese are the passages where he himself says that there is danger\r\nof scientists being accused of magic. For instance, he tells us\r\nthat “scarcely anyone has dared” to speak of astronomical images in\r\npublic, “For those who are acquainted with them are immediately called\r\nmagicians, although really they are the wisest men.”[2256] It also\r\nseems somewhat strange that Bacon should always be so condemnatory and\r\ncontemptuous in his allusions to magic and magicians, when both William\r\nof Auvergne and Albertus Magnus allude to it as sometimes bordering\r\nupon science, in which case they do not regard it unfavorably. The\r\nsuspicion occurs to one that Bacon perhaps protests a little too much,\r\nthat he is condemning magic from a fear that he may be accused of it.\r\nBut are not his apprehensions exaggerated? Does he not overstate the\r\nhostility of canonists and theologians to his many splendid sciences,\r\nand their tendency to confuse them with magic? Thomas of Cantimpré in\r\nthe _De natura rerum_ and Albert in the treatise on minerals and in\r\nthe _Speculum astronomiae_ dared to discuss astronomical images. And\r\nfinally, whether there is any real ground for Bacon’s apprehensions\r\nor not, if he is afraid of being accused of magic, would not this\r\nvery fear keep him from going too far and from thereby incurring\r\ncondemnation in 1278 on this account?\r\n\r\n\r\nV. _Conclusion_\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Characteristics of medieval books.]\r\n\r\nSuch were Roger Bacon’s views bearing upon magic and experimental\r\nscience and their relations to Christian thought, as set forth\r\nprincipally in his _Opus Maius_ and the two other treatises to the pope\r\nwhich supplemented it. Most medieval books impress one as literary\r\nmosaics where the method of arrangement may be new but most of the\r\nfragments are familiar. One soon recognizes, however, that striking\r\nsimilarity in two passages is no sure sign that one is copied from the\r\nother. The authors may have used the same Arabic sources or simply be\r\nrepeating some commonplace thought of the times. Men began with the\r\nsame assumptions and general notions, read the same limited library,\r\nreasoned by common methods, and naturally often reached the same\r\nconclusions, especially since the field of knowledge was not yet so\r\nextensive but that one man might try to cover it all, and since all\r\nused the same medium of thought, the Latin language. New discoveries\r\nwere being made occasionally but slowly, perhaps also sporadically\r\nand empirically. A collection of industrial and chemical recipes\r\nin the thirteenth century may in the main be derived from a set of\r\nthe seventh century or Hellenistic age, but a few new ones have\r\nsomehow got added to the list in the interim. Thomas of Cantimpré’s\r\nencyclopedia professes to be no more than a compilation, but it seems\r\nto contain the first allusion we have to modern plumbing.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Features of Bacon’s _Opus Maius_.]\r\n\r\nBacon’s chief book was a mosaic like the rest, but bears a strong\r\nimpress of his personality. Sometimes there is too much personality,\r\nbut if we allow for this, we find it a valuable, though not a\r\ncomplete nor perfect, picture of medieval learning. Its ideas were\r\nnot brand-new; it was not centuries in advance of its age; but while\r\nits contents may be found scattered in many other places, they will\r\nscarcely be found altogether anywhere else, for it combines the most\r\ndiverse features. In the first place it is a “pious” production, if I\r\nmay employ that adjective in a somewhat objectionable colloquial sense\r\nto indicate roughly a combination of religious, theological, and moral\r\npoints of view. In other words, Bacon continues the Christian attitude\r\nof patristic literature to a certain extent; and his book is written by\r\na clergyman for clergymen, and in order to promote the welfare of the\r\nChurch and Christianity. There is no denying that, hail him as one may\r\nas a herald of modern science. Secondly, he is frequently scholastic\r\nand metaphysical; yet thirdly, is critical in numerous respects; and\r\nfourthly, insists on practical utility as a standard by which science\r\nand philosophy must be judged. Finally, he is an exponent of the aims\r\nand methods of what we have called “the natural magic and experimental\r\nschool,” and as such he sometimes comes near to being scientific. So\r\nthere is no other book quite like the _Opus Maius_ in the Middle Ages,\r\nnor has there been one like it since; yet it is true to its age and is\r\nstill readable to-day. It will therefore always remain one of the most\r\nremarkable books of the remarkable thirteenth century.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[2030] For bibliography of works on Roger Bacon see Theophilus Witzel’s\r\narticle in _The Catholic Encyclopedia_; G.

He then started again on a more modest scale, and wrote\r\nin the next twelve months the preliminary treatise known as the _Opus\r\nMaius_, which was supplemented by the _Opus Minus_, and subsequently,\r\nby the _Opus Tertium_.”\r\n\r\n[2049] Brewer, xlv.\r\n\r\n[2050] _Opus Tertium_, Brewer, 14; “Non igitur mirandum si ego\r\ndilationem tantam fecerim in hac parte.” _Ibid._, 16-17: “Multotiens\r\ndimisi opus, et multotiens desperavi et neglexi procedere.” _Ibid._,\r\n17: “Tanta dilatio in hoc negotio ... vestrae clementiae taedium pro\r\nspe dilata,” and other passages.\r\n\r\n[2051] These excuses are listed in Gasquet, 500, to “antequam primum\r\nvestre dominationis recepi mandatum”; and are repeated in part in _Opus\r\nTertium_, Brewer, 13.\r\n\r\n[2052] To this period the difficulties listed in _Opus Tertium_,\r\nBrewer, 15-17 (middle), would seem to apply. In Brewer, 16, and\r\nGasquet, 502, Bacon states that to get money to meet the expenses\r\nincident to the composition of his work he had sent to his rich brother\r\nin England, but received no response because “exiles and enemies of\r\nthe king occupied the land of my birth,” while his own family had been\r\nexiled as supporters of the crown and ruined financially. All this must\r\nhave occurred before the arrival of the second papal letter in 1266,\r\nfor Simon de Montfort had been slain and the barons defeated in 1265.\r\n\r\n[2053] _Opus Tertium_, Brewer, 5: “Et impedimentorum remedia priorum\r\nnactus.”\r\n\r\n[2054] As Bacon himself states in the _Opus Tertium_, Brewer, 7: “Primo\r\nigitur in opere Secundo.”\r\n\r\n[2055] I cannot agree with Gasquet, 497, that it “is obvious from\r\nnumberless expressions in the work itself” that the _Opus Maius_ was\r\n“addressed to the pope directly.” The last chapter of the first book in\r\nBridges’s text is evidently addressed to the pope, but it is identical\r\nwith a portion of the _Opus Minus_ and evidently does not belong in the\r\n_Opus Maius_ and is not found in the two oldest manuscripts. Similarly\r\na passage of some 16 pages in Bridges on calendar reform, which gives\r\nthe present year as 1267, is practically identical with a chapter of\r\nthe _Opus Tertium_ and was evidently transferred from that work to the\r\n_Opus Maius_ at some later date. When we have excluded these passages\r\nthe work is surprisingly free, compared to the other two works, from\r\npassages suggesting that it is addressed to the pope. The one mention\r\nof the “Apostolic See” (Bridges, I, 77; III, 94) is impersonal and does\r\nnot imply that Foulques was pope, and does not occur in one of the\r\nmanuscripts. Epithets such as “Your Wisdom” (Bridges, I, 17, 23, 305),\r\n“Your Highness” (I, 210; II, 377), “Your Glory” (I, 305; III, 96),\r\n“Your Reverence” (I, 376; II, 219), “Your Holiness” (I, 81; III, 101),\r\n“Your Beatitude” (I, 2, 72; III, 88) do not occur frequently and are\r\nequally applicable to a cardinal, or not found in all the manuscripts,\r\nsuggesting the possibility of their having been inserted later.\r\n\r\n[2056] Such seems to me the most plausible theory of the writing of the\r\nthree works and the one which agrees best with Bacon’s own statements;\r\nbut it is only a hypothesis from the printed texts of his works which\r\nshould be verified by examination of the manuscripts. Probably some of\r\nBacon’s statements can be interpreted to conflict with this hypothesis,\r\nbut they sometimes conflict with each other, and he could not even keep\r\nthe _scriptum principale_ and _Opus Maius_ distinct in his own mind\r\naccording to Brewer’s text (p. 3, “duo transmisi genera scripturarum:\r\nquorum unum est principale,” and p. 5, “principalis scripturae,”\r\nwhereas at p. 60 we read, “Patet igitur quod scriptum principale non\r\npotui mittere”). See also Gasquet, p. 503, and _Opus Tertium_, Brewer,\r\np. 58. I have been stimulated by but cannot accept the conclusions of\r\nFather Mandonnet’s “Roger Bacon et la Composition des Trois ‘Opus’,”\r\n_Revue Néo-Scolastique_ (Louvain, 1913), pp. 52-68 and 164-180.\r\nMandonnet holds that the _Opus Maius_ was written _after_ the other two\r\nworks, which were never finished nor sent, but from which Roger took\r\nsome passages to insert in the _Opus Maius_, which Mandonnet believes\r\nwas sent only in 1268.\r\n\r\n[2057] “Quae tibi videntur adhibenda remedia circa illa, quae nuper\r\nesse (occasione?) tanti discriminis intimasti: et hoc quanto secretius\r\npoteris facias indilate.” E. Jordan, _Les Registres de Clement IV_,\r\netc., gives “_esse_,” which would seem the correct reading rather than\r\nthe “_occasione_” of Martene and Brewer. If one follows their version,\r\nas I did in “The True Roger Bacon,” 242-43, the passage would have to\r\nbe translated, “What remedies you think should be applied in those\r\nmatters indicated by you recently on so critical an occasion.” But\r\napparently there was no such crisis.\r\n\r\n[2058] Part of the _Opus Tertium_ of Roger Bacon (ed. A. G. Little,\r\nAberdeen, 1912), 80-82. This passage is the fourth one and in it\r\nBacon lists the three earlier statements: “Scripsi in tribus locis\r\nVestre Glorie de huiusmodi secretis.” Roger ultimately decides that\r\nhe will not reveal the whole secret even in this fourth instalment,\r\nbecause alchemists never put the full truth into writing; he therefore\r\n“reserves some points for word of mouth.”\r\n\r\n[2059] See the article on “Roger Bacon” by Theophilus Witzel in the\r\nCatholic Encyclopedia.\r\n\r\n[2060] In our chapter on Galen we noted his similar complaints, and\r\nin the coming chapter on Peter of Abano we shall speak of his similar\r\nexperience in having his _Phisionomia_ stolen.

The\r\ninvestigations of Mr. A. G. Little and several other contributors to\r\nthe _Roger Bacon Essays_ of 1914 have demonstrated that his writings\r\nwere not almost forgotten for centuries, but that they exerted a\r\ncontinuous influence. However, owing perhaps to the unfinished state\r\nand rather fragmentary, confused, and scattered form in which they have\r\nsurvived in the manuscripts, they did not appear, as did many of the\r\nworks of medieval science which we have considered, immediately after\r\nthe invention of printing in early editions. No incunabula of them are\r\nknown and only a few brief treatises were printed in the course of the\r\nsixteenth century,[2257] namely, some alchemistic tracts of doubtful\r\nauthorship, a treatise on how to postpone the ills of old age, and\r\nthe “Epistle concerning the secret works of nature and the nullity of\r\nmagic,” which became quite a favorite and was reprinted several times\r\nin Latin and appeared twice both in English and in French translations\r\nin the course of the seventeenth century.[2258]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: His popular reputation as a magician.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, despite what was said of “the nullity of magic” in this\r\ntreatise on the secret works of nature,[2259] Friar Bacon had become\r\nin popular tradition a nigromancer, conjurer, and magician. As such\r\nhe was presented about 1592 in Robert Greene’s play, the “Honourable\r\nHistory of Frier Bacon and Frier Bungay,” with magic wand, perspective\r\nglass, and speaking brazen head, and in the prose “Famous Historie of\r\nFryer Bacon” which appeared about the same time.[2260] In 1625 Naudé\r\nincluded Roger Bacon among the great men of the past whose memory he\r\nendeavored to clear of the false charge of magic.[2261]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Jebb’s edition of the _Opus Maius_.]\r\n\r\nOther medical and alchemistic tracts by Bacon were issued together in\r\n1603,[2262] and some portions of his chief work, the _Opus Maius_,\r\nand other similar fragments dealing with mathematics and optics were\r\npublished in 1614.[2263] But the _Opus Maius_ itself remained unprinted\r\nuntil 1733, when Jebb issued his edition of the work upon which Bacon’s\r\nfame has since largely rested. This edition,[2264] although to-day\r\nbecome quite rare, was perhaps just late enough not to share the\r\nneglect which with the advance of modern science befell the numerous\r\nearlier editions of medieval physicians, alchemists, astrologers,\r\nand natural scientists. On the other hand it was perhaps just early\r\nenough to introduce Roger and his criticisms of the learning of his\r\ncontemporaries to an age whose historical interests were largely\r\ndominated by classicism. And when interest in and study of the middle\r\nages developed in the course of the nineteenth century, for a time it\r\nhad the effect of only increasing the exaggerated emphasis laid upon\r\nRoger Bacon.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: General misestimate of Bacon and of medieval science.]\r\n\r\nAs a result it came to be the fashion in works tracing the history\r\nof this or that department of learning from the times of the ancient\r\nGreeks or Egyptians to our own, in gliding rapidly and at a lofty\r\nheight over the generally unexplored medieval region, and airily\r\ndropping a few bombs concerning the blighting effect of the church\r\nupon freedom of thought and scientific investigation or anent the\r\ninanities of scholasticism, to exclaim at the marvelous apparition of a\r\nmind like Roger Bacon’s in such an age and to hail him as a herald of\r\na later and better civilization. There was the more excuse for doing\r\nthis, since Jebb’s version of the _Opus Maius_ had terminated the text\r\nwith the sixth part on “Experimental Science.”[2265] This theme thus\r\nappeared to be the climax of the work, and the impression was given\r\nthat Roger Bacon was primarily a natural scientist and that he regarded\r\nexperimental method as the supreme thing in the study of nature.\r\nConsequently he came to be regarded by many as the first rebel against\r\nscholasticism and the first prophet of modern science.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Roger Bacon and Francis Bacon.]\r\n\r\nThe fact that his name was Bacon also contributed to Roger’s celebrity,\r\nas Francis Bacon was already a favorite with historians of science and\r\nthought, and it now appeared that he had borrowed some of his ideas\r\nfrom, or had at least been anteceded in them by, the thirteenth century\r\nfriar. Both had criticized scholastic method and urged the great\r\npractical utility possible from applied science. Akin to the idols of\r\nFrancis were Roger’s four causes of human error. The program of endowed\r\nscientific research--based upon an essentially medieval classification\r\nof science and list of anticipated inventions--in which Francis tried\r\nto interest the society of his time in his _New Atlantis_[2266] has a\r\ngeneral resemblance to the attempt of Roger to enlist the support of\r\nthe pope in the cause of science in his _Opus Maius_; while the “Workes\r\nof Nature, Works of Art” of the _New Atlantis_, which made that isle\r\nalmost seem “a Land of Magicians,”[2267] are rather suggestive of the\r\ntreatise, “Of the Secret Works of Art and Nature and the Nullity of\r\nMagic,” by Roger Bacon to whom indeed Francis seems to allude in the\r\n_New Atlantis_ as “Your Monke that was the Inuentour of Ordnance, and\r\nof Gunpowder.”[2268] Roger was by some indeed not only regarded as\r\nsuperior to Francis Bacon in priority, but in having emphasized the\r\nimportance in scientific investigation of mathematical method whose\r\nvalue Francis had failed to appreciate.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Legend of his martyrdom for science.]\r\n\r\nThe next step in the development of the Baconian legend was to\r\nsupply Roger with a biography suited to his supposed position as a\r\nmodern experimental and mathematical scientist in the midst of an\r\nage of religious bigotry and superstition, of gloomy monks and arid\r\ntheologians. Surely, especially in view of his later literary and\r\npopular renown as a magician, he must have been persecuted and a martyr\r\nto science. Abbé Feret has shown how through the nineteenth century\r\nsuccessive historians kept adding to the legend of Friar Bacon’s\r\npersecution by the Franciscan Order without giving any references\r\nto the sources for the details which they elaborated from their own\r\nimaginations.[2269]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Works of Brewer and Charles.]\r\n\r\nThe sources, however, became more accessible with the editing in 1859\r\nin the Rolls Series by Brewer of a number of Bacon’s minor treatises\r\nhitherto unpublished. Brewer, however, was able from the manuscripts\r\nat his disposal, to present only an incomplete text of the _Opus\r\nMinus_, _Opus Tertium_, and _Compendium Studii Philosophiae_. These\r\nserved nevertheless to give a new stimulus to the interest in and the\r\nstudy of Bacon, especially since two years later appeared Charles’\r\nbook on Roger Bacon where were included further extracts from his\r\nunpublished writings. Unfortunately Charles wrote without knowledge\r\nof Brewer’s labors,[2270] and it must be added that several writers\r\non Bacon since have failed to keep abreast with the latest research\r\nin the field.[2271] Charles also was guilty, as Abbé Feret has shown,\r\nof swelling the story of Bacon’s imprisonments, and in other matters\r\nhe jumped to conclusions unwarranted by the sources or indulged in\r\nundiluted imagination.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Minor studies of the later nineteenth century.]\r\n\r\nThe works of Brewer and Charles educed a number of minor essays and\r\nstudies in the following decades. Two unsigned articles on “The life\r\nand writings of Roger Bacon” and “The philosophy of Roger Bacon” which\r\nappeared in _The Westminster Review_ in 1864, are worth noting as\r\ncombining a tendency towards a sane and critical estimate of what Bacon\r\nhad actually said and accomplished, with the inclination to regard\r\nhim as a voice crying in the wilderness of medieval scholasticism\r\nand theology. The writer admitted that the merit of the _Opus Maius_\r\n“lies rather in the spirit in which it was written than in the facts\r\nit records or in any merit which it may have as a scientific whole.”\r\nHe further asserted that “it can easily be shown that of the things\r\nwhich Bacon is asserted to have invented, several were perfectly well\r\nknown before his time, and the rest are nowhere described in his\r\nworks.” The writer also cited some of Roger’s absurd experiments, and\r\nsaid, “Notwithstanding his forcible language about the prerogatives of\r\nexperimental science and his bitter invective against frail authority,\r\nwe find him occasionally resting on authority with childlike faith, and\r\ntreating his favorite science as if its only prerogative was to provoke\r\na smile.” Yet he still maintained that “Bacon preached a philosophy\r\nof which not half-a-dozen men in Europe saw the value, and of which\r\nthe majority of really good men feared the results,” and that “when\r\nRoger Bacon was laid in his grave, the real philosophy was buried with\r\nhim.”[2272] Many of the articles which appeared in the years following\r\nwere of slight value, causing G. Delorme to say in 1910, “Monographs\r\nor studies concerning Bacon are numerous, perhaps too numerous.”[2273]\r\nAs he proceeded to explain, in many of them Bacon was misunderstood and\r\nmisinterpreted, so that they must be read with the greatest caution. On\r\nthe other hand, in 1891 had appeared Abbé Feret’s valuable criticism of\r\nthe legends regarding Bacon’s imprisonments.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Recent editions of Bacon’s works.]\r\n\r\nNext came solid progress in additions to the catalogue of Roger’s\r\nworks and fragments by recent discoveries in the manuscripts, and in\r\nnew or first editions of a number of his previously known writings. In\r\n1897 J. H. Bridges’ fuller, handier, and more correctly arranged two\r\nvolume edition of the _Opus Maius_ replaced Jebb’s now extremely rare\r\nedition. Unfortunately, while supplied with a helpful introduction,\r\nanalytical table of contents, and footnotes, this new version was\r\nso full of misreadings of the manuscripts and other mistakes in the\r\ntext due to an imperfect knowledge of Latin, that in 1900 a third and\r\nsupplementary volume of corrections was added to it. In 1897 Cardinal\r\n(then Father) Gasquet discovered and published a new fragment, which\r\nhe regarded as an introduction to the _Opus Maius_, but which seems\r\nto me evidently the first part of the _Opus Minus_, as Mr. Little has\r\nalready suggested.[2274] Passages in this fragment serve to render\r\neven more untenable the story of Roger’s persecution before 1267.\r\nIn 1902 Nolan and Hirsch edited Bacon’s Greek Grammar. Then in 1909\r\nProfessor Duhem gave to the world a newly discovered fragment of\r\nthe _Opus Tertium_; while in 1911 the British Society of Franciscan\r\nStudies printed the _Compendium Studii Theologiae_, edited by Canon\r\n(now Dean) Hastings Rashdall, and in 1912 more of the _Opus Tertium_,\r\nedited by Mr. A. G. Little. Meanwhile Robert Steele, who in 1905 had\r\nedited a fragment of Bacon’s _Metaphysics_, began in 1912 to produce\r\nthe _Communia Naturalium_ in sections. Other scholars had announced\r\nnew or first editions of other treatises, mathematical, medical or\r\nalchemistic, as in preparation, and the discovery of a complete copy of\r\nthe _Metaphysics_ in the Vatican Library had just been announced when\r\nthe world war broke out and temporarily stayed their publication.[2275]\r\nRecently, however, Mr. Steele has published another volume containing\r\nBacon’s introduction to and version of _The Secret of Secrets_, in the\r\npreface of which he says: “Medieval students will be glad to learn that\r\nthe publication of the whole of Bacon’s work now seems assured.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Continued over-estimate of Bacon.]\r\n\r\nAs Bacon’s works thus became more generally known and as standards of\r\nhistorical criticism grew more strict, not only the facts of his life,\r\nbut his doctrines, point of view, and personal equation were more\r\ncarefully examined and analyzed, and previous exaggerated estimates\r\nof him were questioned or toned down, although still repeated in some\r\nquarters. Indeed, the very writer who rejects some one legend may hold\r\nfast to the old view of Bacon in other respects. Especially hard to\r\ndown has been the notion that Roger Bacon stood almost alone in the\r\nmiddle ages in his advocacy of natural science. Such was still the\r\nimpression given by otherwise excellent recent estimates of Bacon, such\r\nas those in the Catholic Encyclopedia and in Henry Osborn Taylor’s\r\n_The Medieval Mind_,[2276] and such was still the frame of mind in\r\nwhich preparations were made at more than one great university to\r\ncelebrate in 1914 the seventh centennial of his birth--preparations\r\nwhich resulted at Oxford in the publication of an important volume\r\nof commemoration essays by fourteen scholars from various lands and\r\nfields of learning, five of whom were editors of Bacon’s writings,\r\nwhile others had previously published books or articles concerning him,\r\nand still others were authors of general histories of the department of\r\nlearning to which they were now to estimate Bacon’s contributions or\r\nrelation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Beginnings of adverse criticism.]\r\n\r\nAlready, however, before the appearance of this volume Roger Bacon’s\r\npre-eminence and superiority to his times had been questioned from\r\nmore than one quarter. Father Mandonnet in his work on Siger de\r\nBrabant and Latin Averroism affirmed that Bacon’s importance had been\r\nover-estimated in many ways. While Charles had held that, if Bacon’s\r\nscientific worth had been exaggerated, his value as a school-man had\r\nbeen lost sight of, Mandonnet declared that as a philosopher and\r\ntheologian he was behind rather than in the forefront of his age.[2277]\r\nRashdall had asserted in 1911 that “Bacon was more the child of his age\r\nthan he imagined himself to be.”[2278] W. H. V. Reade in the _English\r\nHistorical Review_ for October, 1912,[2279] hoped “that it is not an\r\narticle of faith with the Society of Franciscan Studies to accept all\r\nof Roger Bacon’s statements. As regards the state of knowledge among\r\nhis contemporaries, his assertions are often of no greater value than\r\nthe similar assertions of his distinguished namesake in a later age.”\r\nThe next year Mr. Reade spoke in the same periodical of “the usual\r\nBaconian atmosphere, in which science and superstition are happily or\r\nunhappily compounded.”[2280] In May, 1914, in my paper on “Roger Bacon\r\nand Experimental Method in the Middle Ages,”[2281] I discussed what\r\nhis “experimental science” really amounted to, and showed that it was\r\nrepresentative of the science of his time rather than in revolt against\r\nit.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _The Commemoration Essays._]\r\n\r\nWhen the Oxford _Roger Bacon Essays_ appeared, many of them were marked\r\nby a sane and critical attitude, were restrained and scientific in\r\ntone, and did not indulge in glowing but unsubstantiated eulogies of\r\nthe noted friar. Professor David Eugene Smith gave warning that “one\r\nis liable to be led away by enthusiasm, when writing upon the occasion\r\nof the seven hundredth anniversary of any great leader, to read into\r\nhis works what is not there, and to ascribe to him abilities which\r\nhe never possessed.”[2282] But this tendency both he and most of his\r\nfellow essayists successfully resisted, and the main achievement of\r\nthe volume was to point out Roger’s indebtedness to others for some\r\nof the ideas upon which his fame has rested and to note his mistakes\r\nand superstitions, rather than to bring to light anything new to\r\nhis credit.[2283] It became evident that a careful examination of\r\nthose treatises by Bacon which had been recently edited or were in\r\npreparation for publication, and of those which have recently been\r\nbrought to light in manuscript form or are still difficult of access in\r\nold editions, was unlikely to add much to his stock of ideas as found\r\nin the now well-known _Opus Maius_, _Opus Minus_ and _Opus Tertium_.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[2257] See Little’s lists of Bacon’s writings in the Appendix to the\r\n_Roger Bacon Essays_.\r\n\r\n[2258] _Ibid._, 396.\r\n\r\n[2259] Or perhaps because of it, since “The famous historie of Fryer\r\nBacon” in prose takes two chapters word for word from the English\r\ntranslation of “The Epistle concerning the secret works of nature and\r\nthe nullity of magic”--see Sandys, p. 365 in Little, _Essays_.\r\n\r\n[2260] See J.

In the\r\npresent work these articles will be found embodied in the chapter on\r\nAdelard of Bath and in Appendix II to this chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX II\r\n\r\nROGER BACON AND GUNPOWDER\r\n\r\n\r\nIn his paper “Roger Bacon and Gunpowder” contributed to the _Roger\r\nBacon Commemoration Essays_, Colonel Hime tries to prove Roger Bacon\r\nthe inventor of gunpowder by the method employed to prove Francis Bacon\r\nthe author of Shakespeare’s plays--a cipher. Since other contributors\r\nto the same volume refer favorably to this effort (Mr. A. G. Little,\r\np. 395, calls it an “ingenious explanation” and Mr. Patterson Muir, p.\r\n301, says that “Colonel Hime establishes a large probability” in its\r\nfavor) it may be well to note some points against it quite apart from\r\nthe merits of the cipher itself.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, the cipher is based upon chapters of the _Epistola\r\nde secretis operibus naturae et de nullitate magiae_ not found in the\r\nearly manuscript of that work and considered doubtful by Charles in\r\nhis work on Roger Bacon. Indeed, the opening phrases of two chapters\r\n“Transactis annis Arabum sexcentis et duobus,” and “Annis Arabum 630\r\ntransactis” suggest their source.\r\n\r\nSecondly, Roger Bacon openly alludes to gunpowder in 1267 in his\r\n_Opus Tertium_ as already in common use in children’s toy explosives.\r\nTherefore Colonel Hime has to date the _De secretis_ in 1248, and to\r\nhold that Bacon was at that time “driven to employ cryptic methods by\r\nfear of the Inquisition” (p. 334), but that by 1267 “Circumstances had\r\ntotally changed in the lapse of years; the composition of gunpowder ...\r\nhad been divulged, and the first use made of the deadly mixture was for\r\nthe amusement of children” (p. 321). This transition from fear of the\r\ninquisition to child’s play might seem in itself a sufficient _reductio\r\nad absurdum_.\r\n\r\nBut is there any good reason for dating the _De secretis_ in 1248? Much\r\nof it sounds like a brief popular compilation from Bacon’s three works\r\nof 1266-7 concocted by some one else later; compare, for instance,\r\nthe first paragraph of the sixth chapter of the _De secretis_ with\r\nDuhem, _Un fragment inédit de l’Opus Tertium_, 153-4, and Little,\r\n_Part of the Opus Tertium_, 50-51. Charles considered the last five\r\nchapters to be of dubious authenticity, and they are not found in the\r\noldest manuscript of the thirteenth century. The dedication of the _De\r\nsecretis_ to William, bishop of Paris, who died in 1249, occurs first\r\nin the late edition of 1618 and has not been found by Little in any\r\nmanuscript.\r\n\r\nThen the inquisition bug-a-boo is negligible. Has any one ever shown\r\nthat the inquisition punished a practical invention? It was not for\r\nhaving invented the telescope that Galileo was persecuted. Moreover,\r\nGalileo’s was an exceptional case, and it can not be shown that in the\r\nthirteenth century the church persecuted men of science. Rather, popes\r\nand prelates were their patrons. Finally the inquisition seems to have\r\nbeen set up in England on only one occasion during the middle ages.\r\n\r\nBut even if we admit that Bacon wrote the _De secretis_ as we have it\r\nin 1248 and was at that time afraid of the Inquisition, the question\r\nremains: why in 1267-8, when mentioning the explosive in those works in\r\nwhich he made such desperate efforts to secure the pope as his patron,\r\nand boasted repeatedly of his own superiority to his contemporaries,\r\ndid he not claim the credit of the invention which he had set forth\r\nin cipher twenty years before? The simple answer is: it was not his\r\ninvention.\r\n\r\nOne instance must be added to show how Colonel Hime misinterprets the\r\ntext of the _De secretis_ in his eagerness to smell powder everywhere.\r\nHe writes (p. 324): “Now, towards the end of Chap. X., Bacon speaks\r\nwithout disguise of charcoal under the name of the wood from which it\r\nis made, and mentions the two trees, hazel and willow, which give the\r\nbest. He significantly adds that when charcoal is added to proper\r\nproportions of certain other substances, something noteworthy happens.\r\nSince, then, charcoal is one of the subjects of these two chapters,\r\nit becomes all the more probable that saltpeter forms another.” In\r\na note Hime adds the Latin of the passage in question: _Si vero\r\npartes virgulti coryli aut salicis multarum justa rerum serie apte\r\nordinaveris, unionem naturalem servabunt: et hoc non tradas oblivioni,\r\nquia valet ad multa_.\r\n\r\nLet us note first that these last words do not mean, “something\r\nnoteworthy happens,” but “don’t forget this, because it’s valuable.”\r\nThus the true wording does not in the least suggest an explosion, as\r\nColonel Hime’s translation does. Rather it suggests if anything the\r\nphraseology of mystical and magical works generally, like the closing\r\nwords of Thebit ben Corat’s treatise on Images, _Intellige quod exposui\r\ntibi, et si queris ordinem invenies effectum ne dubites_. (Bodleian MS\r\n463, fol. 77v, Explicit.) Secondly, the words _partes virgulti coryli\r\naut salicis_ probably do not denote charcoal but twigs or rods of hazel\r\nor willow, as they do in Bacon’s account of the experiment performed by\r\nmagicians with a split hazel rod. It occurs both in the _Opus Maius_\r\n(Bridges, II, 219) and _Opus Tertium_ (Little, 49-50; Duhem, 153); I\r\nquote the latter. _Unde magici accipiunt virgas coruli et salicum, et\r\ndividunt eas secundum longitudinem, et faciunt eas distare secundum\r\nquantitatem palmae, et addunt carmina sua, et coniungunt partes divise;\r\nsed non propter carmina, sed ex naturali proprietate._ (Wherefore\r\nmagicians take rods of hazel and willow, and divide them lengthwise,\r\nand hold them the breadth of a palm apart, and add their charms, and\r\nthe divided parts come together; but not on account of the charms, but\r\nfrom their very natures.) Moreover, we have already heard this matter\r\nof the split hazel rod discussed by William of Auvergne, and noted that\r\nit was repeated by Albertus Magnus and John of St. Amand, a medieval\r\nwriter about 1261, as well as by Bacon.\r\n\r\nThirdly, it is probably precisely this hazel-rod experiment to which\r\nthe writer of the passage quoted by Hime refers. _Multarum justa rerum\r\nserie ordinaveris_ seems a hurried equivalent for the more specific\r\ndirections in the passages in the _Opus Maius_ and _Opus Tertium_, and\r\nthis bears out what I have already suggested, that the _De secretis_\r\nmay be in part at least a brief popular compilation from Bacon’s other\r\nworks. Finally, the phrase _unionem naturalem servabunt_ applies better\r\nto the bending together in the middle of two halves of a split hazel\r\nrod held apart at the ends than it does to a mixture of saltpeter,\r\ncharcoal and sulphur.\r\n\r\nAnd now what becomes of Colonel Hime’s assertion, “Since therefore\r\ncharcoal is one of the subjects of these two chapters, it becomes all\r\nthe more probable that saltpeter forms another?” We may alter it to\r\nread thus: since charcoal is not a subject of either of these chapters,\r\nit becomes all the more improbable that a method of refining saltpeter\r\nis disclosed in them in cipher.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXII\r\n\r\nTHE SPECULUM ASTRONOMIAE\r\n\r\n\r\n Who was its author?--Points in favor of Albert as\r\n its author--Testimony of medieval manuscripts and\r\n authors--Occasion for writing the _Speculum_--Defense of\r\n astronomy--And of judicial astrology--The stars do not\r\n possess senses or reason--Subdivisions of astrology--Evil\r\n images--A second variety--Good astronomical images--The\r\n question of free will--And elections--Free will and\r\n nativities--Revolutions--Interrogations--Better not to\r\n destroy the books of necromancy--Experimental books in\r\n the arts of divination--Resemblance of the _Speculum_ to\r\n Albert’s attitude to astrology--Is it more like Bacon on\r\n the question of Christ’s relation to the stars?--Attitude\r\n to magic of the _Speculum_ and Albert--Of Bacon and the\r\n _Speculum_--Significance of the failure to mention magic\r\n in the _Speculum_--Similarity of its citations to those\r\n in other works of Albert--Is the _Speculum astronomiae_\r\n to be connected with the Paris condemnation of 1277?--The\r\n _Speculum_ was written before 1277--Condemnation of Siger\r\n de Brabant--Condemned opinions connected with astrology;\r\n with science and religion--Other later moves against\r\n magic at Paris--Appendix I.

Germath of Babylon, Gergis, and\r\n Girgith.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Who was its author?]\r\n\r\nThe _Speculum astronomiae_[2284] has been reserved for separate\r\ntreatment, partly because it seems to be one of the most important\r\nsingle treatises in the history of medieval astrology, and partly\r\nbecause the traditional ascription of it to Albertus Magnus has been\r\nrecently questioned and the attempt made to attribute it to Roger\r\nBacon.[2285] This attempt has been supported by so little in the\r\nway of real evidence for a Baconian authorship that it might be\r\npassed by, were it not for the fact that, as sensational assertions\r\nconcerning either Roger or Francis Bacon are apt to do, it has\r\nattracted widespread attention and been unquestioningly accepted by\r\nother students of Roger Bacon.[2286] Father Mandonnet adduced no\r\nmanuscript evidence in favor of Bacon’s authorship and Gabriel Naudé\r\nin the seventeenth century was the first person to suggest it.[2287]\r\nMandonnet’s argument for the Baconian authorship reduces simply to\r\nthis, that the views expressed in the work are Bacon’s rather than\r\nAlbert’s and that the writing of the _Speculum astronomiae_ could be\r\nfitted better into Roger’s career.[2288]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Points in favor of Albert as its author.]\r\n\r\nWe shall show, on the contrary, that the _Speculum_ is regularly\r\nascribed to Albertus Magnus in the medieval manuscripts and in\r\nbibliographies by learned writers of the fourteenth and fifteenth\r\ncenturies, as well as by most students of Albertus Magnus or of\r\nthirteenth century learning since then.[2289] The Latin style and the\r\nmethod of presentation adopted in the _Speculum_ also more closely\r\nresemble Albert’s style and method than they do Bacon’s.[2290] It\r\nhas already been demonstrated that Mandonnet was grossly in error in\r\nrepresenting Albert as an unqualified opponent of judicial astrology,\r\nand our coming examination of the _Speculum astronomiae_ will show\r\nthat on most points its attitude to astrology is the same as that of\r\nAlbert, on some points even more conservative than his, and on only\r\none point less so and more like Bacon’s attitude. In the attitude of\r\nthe _Speculum_ toward other forms of magic or occult sciences than\r\nastrology we shall find a closer approximation to the Albertine than\r\nto the Baconian view-point, and also some internal textual evidence\r\nwhich strongly supports the Albertine authorship. Finally we shall\r\nargue that, if it is true that the _Speculum_ had some connection\r\nwith the condemnation at Paris in 1277 of 219 opinions attributed to\r\nSiger of Brabant, it may have been written for that occasion by Albert\r\nas appropriately as by Bacon. And we shall note some of the opinions\r\ncondemned on that occasion as constituting, with the _Speculum_ itself,\r\nvaluable evidence concerning the relations existing between theology\r\nand astrology in the second half of the thirteenth century.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Testimony of medieval manuscripts and authors.]\r\n\r\nIn so far as I have examined notices of manuscripts of the _Speculum\r\nastronomiae_ in the catalogues or the manuscripts themselves, I have\r\nfound it in no case attributed to Roger Bacon and regularly ascribed\r\nto Albertus Magnus, as the list of manuscripts given in the appendix\r\nat the close of this chapter will show. In one or two cases another\r\nhand than that in which the text of the _Speculum_ is written has\r\nsuggested “master Philip, chancellor of Paris,” as author instead\r\nof Albert, but otherwise the manuscripts support the Albertine\r\nauthorship. The _Speculum_ is cited as Albert’s in a fourteenth century\r\nmanuscript.[2291] Also the list of writings by Dominicans drawn\r\nup before the middle of the fourteenth century ascribed to Albert\r\nboth a _Contra librum nigromanticorum_ and a _Speculum astrobium_\r\n(or _astralabicum_).[2292] Later in the same century a contemporary\r\nof Thomas of Pisa or Bologna, physician and astrologer to Charles\r\nV the Wise of France, 1364-1380, cites “Albert the commentator\r\nin his Mirror.”[2293] In 1412 Amplonius in the catalogue of his\r\nmanuscripts which he wrote with his own hand lists both a _Speculum\r\nmathematicum Alberti Magni_ and a _Speculum domini Alberti de libris\r\nmathematicis_;[2294] and Schum’s modern catalogue of the Amplonian\r\ncollection at Erfurt lists three manuscripts of the _Speculum\r\nastronomiae_ of the fourteenth century and in every case ascribes it\r\nto Albert.[2295] Early in the fifteenth century also Cardinal Pierre\r\nd’Ailly more than once cited the _Speculum_ as by Albert,[2296], as did\r\nGerson and Nicholas of Denmark in the same century.[2297] Pignon and\r\nValleoletanus also ascribed it to Albert in their catalogues of the\r\nwritings of Dominicans.[2298] At the close of the fifteenth century\r\nPico della Mirandola in his work against astrology was almost the first\r\nto question Albert’s authorship, which he did in an effort to weaken\r\nthe reliance of the adherents of astrology upon the authority of Albert\r\nas a defender of that art.[2299] Pico apparently did not possess a\r\nsufficiently extensive knowledge of Albert’s other writings to pass\r\nupon the question of the authenticity of the _Speculum_, or he would\r\nnot have imagined that by questioning the Albertine authorship of\r\nit, he could prevent the adherents of astrology from citing numerous\r\npassages in Albert’s works in favor of their art. But now as to the\r\nastrological doctrine of the _Speculum_ itself.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Occasion for writing the _Speculum_.]\r\n\r\nThe _Proemium_ or opening chapter of the _Speculum astronomiae_, or\r\n_Mirror of Astrology_, states the occasion for writing it, namely,\r\nthe existence of certain works hostile to Christianity, many of which\r\nare actually concerned with necromancy but make false profession of\r\nastronomy or astrology. On this account “some great men” have censured\r\nother books which may be quite harmless, and noble volumes of astronomy\r\nhave been brought under suspicion and into disrepute. Therefore the\r\nwriter, who describes himself vaguely as a devotee both of the Faith\r\nand of Philosophy, has made a critical bibliography of both kinds of\r\nworks, giving their authors’ names, their titles, opening words, and a\r\ngeneral notion of their contents.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Defense of astronomy.]\r\n\r\nIn the next chapter the author takes up books which we should regard\r\nas purely astronomical, and says that if these were to be suppressed,\r\n“a great and truly noble part of philosophy would be buried for a time\r\nat least, until owing to saner counsels it should rise again.” He adds\r\nthat those who have read these books know that there is not a single\r\nword in them which is, or even appears to be, against the Catholic\r\nFaith, and that it is not fair for those to judge them who have never\r\neven handled them.[2300] Thus the writer seems to think that there is\r\nsome danger of an attack upon even the study of astronomy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: And of judicial astrology.]\r\n\r\nThe author’s main concern, however, is with judicial astrology, which\r\nin the third chapter he distinguishes from astronomy proper as “the\r\nscience of judgments of the stars.” Of it, too, he speaks in high\r\nterms of praise. He declares that it turns man’s thoughts toward God,\r\nrevealing as it does the great Source of all things. Furthermore, it is\r\nthe bond between natural philosophy and mathematics. “For if the most\r\nhigh God in His Supreme wisdom so ordained this world that He, who is\r\nthe living God of a lifeless heaven, wills to work in created things\r\nwhich are found in these four inferior elements through deaf and dumb\r\nstars as instruments, and if concerning these we have one science,\r\nnamely, mathematics which teaches us in things caused to consider\r\ntheir Creator, and another natural science which teaches us to find by\r\nexperience in created things the Creator of creatures; what is more\r\ndesirable for the investigator than to have a third science to instruct\r\nhim how this and that change of things mundane is brought to pass by\r\nthe change of things celestial?”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The stars do not possess senses or reason.]\r\n\r\nIt will be noted that the author of the _Speculum_ regards the stars as\r\n“deaf and dumb” and the heaven as inanimate. In a later chapter[2301]\r\nhe condemns as “most evidently meriting censure” the assertion made by\r\nAlbumasar, apparently upon Aristotle’s authority, that “the planets\r\nthemselves are animated by a rational soul.” For him the stars are\r\nmere divine instruments, deaf to would-be worshipers of them, and too\r\ndumb--one would infer--to produce the music of the spheres.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Subdivisions of astrology.]\r\n\r\nThe fourth chapter of the _Speculum_ speaks of the four familiar\r\nsub-divisions of judicial astrology, namely, revolutions, nativities,\r\ninterrogations, and elections. To the last is annexed the science of\r\nimages, which the author regards as the acme or climax of “astronomy,”\r\nbut with which he admits are associated those necromantic books of evil\r\nrepute which he proposes carefully to distinguish from the others.\r\nThis at once reminds us of the passages in Albert’s _Minerals_ where\r\nhe spoke of the connection between such images engraved on stones and\r\nnecromancy, but where his associates were curious to know the doctrine\r\nof images none the less, and he affirmed that it was good doctrine.\r\nNow, after the fifth chapter, which may be described as a statement\r\nof astrological theory and technique in a nutshell, he takes up\r\njudicial astrology and its several sub-divisions in further successive\r\nchapters,[2302] defining the field and describing the literature. A\r\nmajority of the books listed, good as well as bad, appear to be Latin\r\ntranslations from the Arabic.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Evil images.]\r\n\r\nOf images the author describes three varieties, the first two of which\r\nhe severely condemns. The first kind is abominable, including the\r\nimages of Toz Graecus and Germath of Babylon, those connected with the\r\nworship of Venus, and those of Belenus and Hermes. These are exorcized\r\nby the names of fifty-four[2303] angels who are said to serve in the\r\ncircle of the moon,[2304] but are probably really the names of demons.\r\nThe names of seven are engraved forwards to procure a good result and\r\nbackwards in order to ward off evil fortune. Suffumigations also are\r\nmade with aloes, saffron, and balsam to achieve a good result, with\r\nother woods for evil ends. The author explains that the spirits are not\r\ntruly coerced by such things, but sometimes God allows them to pretend\r\nto be, in order to deceive sinful men. The practices associated with\r\nthis first kind of images he censures as the worst sort of idolatry,\r\nalthough their practitioners, in order to retain something worthy\r\nof belief, observe the twenty-eight mansions of the moon and other\r\nseasons.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A second variety.]\r\n\r\nThe second variety of images is a little less improper, but still\r\ndetestable. In it certain names are exorcized by the inscription of\r\ncharacters. Such are the four rings of Solomon and the nine candelabra\r\nand the three figures of spirits who are called the princes of the four\r\nquarters of the world, and the Almandel of Solomon, the seven names\r\nfrom the book _Uraharum_,[2305] the fifteen from _The Institutes of\r\nRaziel_, and so on. “Far from us be this sort also,” says our author,\r\n“for it is open to the suspicion that beneath the names in unknown\r\ntongues may lie hidden something contrary to the purity of the Catholic\r\nFaith.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Good astronomical images.]\r\n\r\nThe third variety of images, in which the author sees no harm but much\r\ngood, and which he has called “the sublimest part of astronomy,”[2306]\r\nare purely astronomical images which derive their virtue from the\r\nconfigurations of the sky but admit no other inscription of characters,\r\nand neither exorcisms, invocations, nor suffumigations.[2307] In a\r\nlater chapter,[2308] however, he permits in addition to astronomical\r\nfigures and symbols the engraving of certain simple words and images\r\nof objects of obvious meaning, such as a scorpion and the word\r\n_Destruatur_ upon an image intended to drive scorpions away.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The question of free will.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, between these two chapters upon astronomical images,\r\nthe author returns in four chapters to the other sub-divisions\r\nof astrology, mainly with the purpose of investigating whether\r\nrevolutions, nativities, interrogations, and elections are incompatible\r\nwith freedom of the human will,--a question upon which he has already\r\ntouched a little in previous chapters. He maintains the usual position\r\nthat the celestial influences make impressions according to the fitness\r\nof matter to receive them, and that man by using his intellect can to a\r\nconsiderable degree be master of his fate. As usual he cites Ptolemy’s\r\n_dictum_ that “the astrologer can avert much evil from the operation of\r\nthe stars, if he knows the nature of the influence to be exerted upon\r\nhim and can prepare himself beforehand to receive it.”[2309]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: And elections.]\r\n\r\nTherefore the author regards election of favorable hours as an\r\nadmission alike of freedom of the will and of astrological influence,\r\nand affirms that “in entering upon great undertakings, it is rashness,\r\nnot freedom of the will, to despise election of the hour.”[2310]\r\nMoreover, he asserts that “all philosophers are agreed in this, that\r\nwhen we know the hour of impregnation of any woman, we thereby know\r\nthe history of the foetus until it breathes and comes forth from\r\nthe womb and until death.”[2311] Hence one should choose the moment\r\nof conception as carefully as the hour for a surgical operation,--a\r\npassage paralleled by Albert’s account elsewhere of the care exercised\r\nby Nectanebus as to the hour of his intercourse with Olympias.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Free will and nativities.]\r\n\r\nDespite what he has just said about tracing the history of the foetus\r\nuntil death, the author regards the doctrine of nativities as in large\r\nmeasure inconsistent with freedom of the will.[2312] After the mental\r\nand moral faculties have sufficiently developed, he believes in freedom\r\nof choice, and so holds that the casting of horoscopes, especially in\r\nregard to moral characteristics, infringes upon free will. Even when\r\nsuch a matter as length of life is predicted from the constellations\r\nfor an individual, he contends that it does not mean that one must live\r\nthat long, but that one’s natural term of life cannot be prolonged\r\nbeyond that point.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Revolutions.]\r\n\r\nThe author seems to think that the human will has very little control\r\nover revolutions, by which “is indicated what God, the glorious, will\r\naccomplish in a given year through the stars as His instruments” for\r\nstates and peoples; in other words, such general events as harvests,\r\nwars, earthquakes, floods, and terrible prodigies. Events signified by\r\ncomets come under this head also. All such events the author seems to\r\nregard as divinely ordered and he cites Ptolemy and Albumasar to the\r\neffect that God’s plans are not changeable like those of children or\r\nservants.[2313]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Interrogations.]\r\n\r\nAs for the practice of interrogations, the author affirms that to\r\ninquire of the stars what course of action one should pursue “does\r\nnot destroy, but rather rectifies free will.” Some questions asked\r\nof astrologers, nevertheless, are very difficult to reconcile with\r\nfree will, for example, the question whether another person will\r\nanswer one’s request. If an astrologer is able to answer such a\r\nquestion beforehand, it seems to indicate that the other person\r\nhas no freedom in the matter. After some juggling with the terms,\r\n“necessity” and “possibility,” the author thinks that he has found a\r\nmode of reconciliation in “the compossibility of free will with divine\r\nprovidence,” since with the latter he identifies the significations\r\nof the stars, and “God knew from eternity which course the man would\r\nchoose.” Our author hastens to add, however, that God may wish to\r\nconceal some things from us, and that he will not assert that “whatever\r\ndoes not escape divine providence is revealed in the heavens.”[2314]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Better not to destroy the books of necromancy.]\r\n\r\nIn the seventeenth and last chapter the author returns to the subject\r\nof books of necromancy and suggests that after all even these had\r\nbetter be preserved rather than destroyed, because the time is now\r\nperchance near when, for reasons which he will not now disclose, it may\r\nbe of advantage to consult them occasionally; “yet let those inspecting\r\nthem beware of abuse of them.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Experimental books in the arts of divination.]\r\n\r\nThe author adds that there are also “certain experimental books whose\r\nnames have the same ending as nigromancy,” namely, books in the\r\nsubjects of geomancy, hydromancy, aerimancy, pyromancy, and chiromancy.\r\nThus we have another example of the association of experiment and\r\nmagic. These arts, however, in his opinion “do not deserve to be called\r\nsciences, but babblings (_garamantie_ or _garrimantiae_).”[2315]\r\nHydromancy consists in washing the entrails of animals and inspecting\r\nthe fibres. Pyromancy divines from the appearance of the fire by which\r\nthe sacrifice is consumed. Both these arts probably involve a sort of\r\nidolatry. The author finds nothing idolatrous in geomancy, however,\r\nwhich is based upon astrology and numbers. But aerimancy is frivolous,\r\nthough it may pretend to be based upon number. Chiromancy he does not\r\nwish to judge hastily, because it may be a part of physiognomy which\r\nin turn depends upon astrology, since in physiognomy both the physical\r\npeculiarities and the personal characteristics inferred from them are\r\ndue to the stars. The author thus shows the common tendency of medieval\r\nmen of learning to justify only such methods of divination as they felt\r\ncould be based upon astrology.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Resemblance of the _Speculum_ to Albert’s attitude to\r\nastrology.]\r\n\r\nThe foregoing analysis of the _Speculum astronomiae_ has made it\r\nevident that its attitude toward astrology is not at all a peculiar\r\none but just about the usual position of Christian scientists in the\r\ntwelfth and thirteenth centuries. On the subject of astrological\r\nimages, however, its view is that of Albertus Magnus and Roger Bacon\r\nrather than that of William of Auvergne or Thomas Aquinas. In general\r\nthe astrological position of the _Speculum_ closely parallels the\r\nattitudes of Albertus Magnus and Roger Bacon, who in turn held almost\r\nidentical views. If anything, the _Speculum_ is somewhat less favorable\r\nto astrological doctrine than Albertus. Whereas he in large measure\r\naccepted the casting of horoscopes, although saving free will, it\r\nemphasizes the conflict between free will and nativities. And it\r\nmore emphatically denies that the stars are animated, a point upon\r\nwhich he seemed rather hazy in his scientific treatises. But there\r\nis no actual contradiction between the _Speculum_ and other works of\r\nAlbert on these points, and we have already seen in the case of his\r\ntheological and Aristotelian works that Albert is likely to state the\r\nsame thing somewhat differently according to the point-of-view from\r\nwhich he writes. The writer of the _Speculum_ is obviously desirous to\r\nconciliate a theological opposition to or suspicion of “astronomy” and\r\ntherefore naturally inclines to be moderate and conservative in his\r\nadvocacy of astrological doctrine.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Is it more like Bacon on the question of Christ’s relation\r\nto the stars?]\r\n\r\nOn one point only does the _Speculum_ appear more radical in its\r\nastrological theory than Albert elsewhere and more in accord with views\r\nexpressed by Roger Bacon. We have heard Albert in his _Summa_ deny\r\nthat Christ was born under the influence of the stars, while Bacon was\r\ninclined to agree with the astrologers that He was, in so far as His\r\nbirth was natural and His nature human. The writer of the _Speculum_\r\ncites Albumasar to the effect that the Virgin birth of Jesus Christ was\r\nprefigured in the sky,[2316] and regards this assertion as a notable\r\nconfirmation of the true Faith, not that the Lord of all things was\r\nunder the stars but that what God had decreed was signified by the\r\nstars. Thus there is after all perhaps no necessary conflict with\r\nAlbert’s attitude in the _Summa_, since both _Speculum_ and _Summa_\r\ndeny that Christ is under the stars. However, the _Speculum_ gives\r\nthe impression that the birth of Christ was signified astrologically;\r\nthe _Summa_, that it was signified miraculously. But neither does the\r\n_Speculum_ quite agree with Bacon who suggests that Christ’s body was\r\nunder the stars. And the fact that Bacon cites the same passage from\r\nAlbumasar is of little value as a sign that he is the author of the\r\n_Speculum_, since the passage in Albumasar was a well-known one and is\r\ncited in such a vernacular work as _The Romance of the Rose_.[2317]\r\nThus the astrological doctrine of the _Speculum_ offers little or no\r\nreason for questioning the traditional ascription of that treatise to\r\nAlbertus Magnus.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Attitude to magic of the _Speculum_ and Albert.]\r\n\r\nWe have next to inquire, does the attitude of the _Speculum_ to\r\nother magic arts accord or conflict with that of Albert elsewhere?\r\nOur study of Albert’s attitude toward magic in his other works has\r\nmade it abundantly evident that Mandonnet was mistaken in deeming\r\nhim too hostile to such superstition to have written the _Speculum_.\r\nHe is, on the contrary, too favorable, if anything, toward magic,\r\nto have been the author of that treatise. Indeed, it was to the\r\n_Speculum astronomiae_, which he accepted as a genuine work, that\r\nPeter of Prussia appealed in his effort to prove Albert’s hostility to\r\nnecromancy and magic. Yet Mandonnet cites these very pages of Peter of\r\nPrussia in his effort to show that Albert was too hostile to occult\r\narts to have written the _Speculum_! On the other hand, we saw that\r\nAlbert’s attitude to magic varied somewhat in his different works, so\r\nit is no disproof of his authorship of the _Speculum_ that it seems\r\nmore hostile to magic than some of Albert’s utterances elsewhere. The\r\noccasion of writing the treatise is probably sufficient to explain this.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Of Bacon and the _Speculum_.]\r\n\r\nWe have to admit, however, that Roger Bacon almost invariably spoke of\r\n“magic” unfavorably, whereas Albert a number of times used the word in\r\na good or neutral sense. Thus there might seem to be some reason for\r\nascribing the _Speculum_ to Bacon for the exactly opposite reason to\r\nthat advanced by Mandonnet, namely, that he displayed more hostility\r\nthan Albert to magic. Also there is a certain resemblance between the\r\nattitude of the author of the _Speculum_ toward books of necromancy\r\nand what we saw to be Bacon’s attitude toward books of magic in his\r\n_De secretis operibus artis et naturae et de nullitate magiae_. But\r\nthere is also a difference, and when Mandonnet asserts, “Both authors\r\nreject books of magic,”[2318] he gives a false impression and overlooks\r\nan interesting point. For the _De secretis operibus_ not only tries\r\nto distinguish between books of magic and others which are unjustly\r\nregarded as magical, it also is largely devoted to an attack upon\r\n“magic.” And such censure of magic is frequent in Bacon’s works. The\r\n_Speculum_, on the other hand, distinguishes between “necromantic” and\r\n“astronomical” works, and never mentions “magic.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Significance of the failure to mention magic in the\r\n_Speculum_.]\r\n\r\nIs not this significant? Had Bacon written the _Speculum_, would he\r\nnot have indulged in his usual censure of magicians and their follies?\r\nBut if Albert wrote the _Speculum_, is it surprising that he maintains\r\na discreet silence concerning that “magic” which he had coupled more\r\nthan once with astronomy and had spoken of as a field bordering upon\r\nthat of natural science? In undertaking the defense of “astronomical\r\nimages” against those who looked at them askance, would he deem it\r\nprudent to repeat his assertion in the treatise on minerals that to\r\ncomprehend astronomical images one must go to “the science of the\r\nmagi”? In that treatise on minerals, it will be recalled, he had been\r\nbold enough to propose to discuss the doctrine of images, even if it\r\nwas closely associated with necromancy, and he twice associated in the\r\nsame phrase “astronomy and magic and the necromantic sciences.” But\r\nthen he was writing for his pupils and associates who were eager to\r\nlearn of the images engraved on gems, even if they were connected with\r\nnecromancy. In the _Speculum_ he writes for a different audience, or\r\nfor an audience in a different mood,--men inclined to condemn books of\r\nastronomy and astrology along with books of necromancy. Where before he\r\nadmitted an association, he now has to make a contrast and to give the\r\nimpression of a great gulf fixed between necromancy and astronomy. To\r\nsave astrology from hostile attack he gives up necromancy, and probably\r\nwillingly and sincerely enough, since his allusions to it even in the\r\ntreatise on minerals were rather unfavorable. Is it strange that he\r\nsays nothing of the connecting link, “magic,” which he perhaps does\r\nnot wish to condemn, yet does not feel it expedient to defend? May it\r\nnot be one of those reasons, which the author of the _Speculum_ says\r\nhe will not disclose, why even the books of necromancy had better be\r\npreserved rather than destroyed? Thus the failure of the author of the\r\n_Speculum astronomiae_ to use the word “magic” does not sound in the\r\nleast like Roger Bacon, but does seem to be just about what one might\r\nexpect in the circumstances from Albert, whose mentions moreover of\r\n“magic” in his other works are brief and occasional.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Similarity of its citations to those in other works of\r\nAlbert.]\r\n\r\nFinally we may note a positive bit of evidence in favor of the\r\nAlbertine authorship of the _Speculum_ which has hitherto escaped\r\nnotice. His other writings mention some of the very books of necromancy\r\nwhich the _Speculum_ lists and condemns. In his theological _Summa_,\r\nwhen denouncing magic as concerned with evil spirits, he supported his\r\nview not merely by the authority of the saints and common report, but\r\nalso by “the teachings of that branch of necromancy” which treats of\r\n“images and rings and mirrors of Venus and seals of demons,” and is\r\nexpounded in the writings of Achot of Greece, Grema of Babylon, Hermes\r\nthe Egyptian, and other treatises which he mentions.[2319] Again in\r\nthe treatise on minerals, in investigating why gems are engraved with\r\nimages, he cites as authorities Magor Graecus, Germa Babylonicus, and\r\nHermes the Egyptian.[2320] The _Speculum_ also especially mentions in\r\nits list of necromantic books on images Toz Graeci, Germath of Babylon,\r\nBelenus, and Hermes.[2321] Leaving Belenus out of account, there can\r\nbe little doubt that the other three names are identical with the two\r\npreceding trios. One also is impelled to believe that the same Albert\r\nwrote _Summa_, _Mineralium_, and _Speculum_, and it may be added that\r\nthe variation in the attitude towards images and necromancy in the\r\nlatter two is no greater than the difference in the attitude towards\r\nmagic which we observed between the first two of those treatises. This\r\ntoo makes it plausible that Albert should have adopted a third attitude\r\nof silence concerning “magic” in the _Speculum_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Is the _Speculum astronomiae_ to be connected with the\r\ncondemnation of 1277?]\r\n\r\nThere remains the question, when and why was the _Speculum astronomiae_\r\nwritten? Its tone suggests that it is not merely a general defense of\r\nastronomy and astrology but a specific reply to some particular attack\r\nupon astrological literature made by a party inclined to connect and\r\ncondemn astrology together with necromancy and other forbidden occult\r\narts. Such an attack can perhaps be seen in the condemnation at Paris\r\nin 1277 of two hundred and nineteen opinions attributed to Siger de\r\nBrabant. Many of them are astrological and with them are condemned\r\na treatise of geomancy, works of necromancy, and books “containing\r\nexperiments of lot-casters, invocations of demons, and conjurations\r\nperilous to the soul.”[2322] It is natural to associate the writing\r\nof the _Speculum astronomiae_ with this affair, and the idea had\r\noccurred to me before I read any of Mandonnet’s works. It is also\r\nnatural, especially if one holds the old view that Roger Bacon was\r\npersecuted for science’s sake and suspected of magic, to wonder if\r\nthere is not some connection between the condemnation of 1277 and his\r\nown condemnation in 1278 “on account of certain suspected novelties”;\r\nand Mandonnet is not the first to do so.[2323] But he is the first\r\nto suggest that Bacon was condemned in 1278 for having written the\r\n_Speculum astronomiae_ in connection with the other condemnation of\r\n1277. But we have seen that there is little reason for thinking that\r\nBacon’s condemnation was for astrology or magic. Second, it may be\r\ndoubted whether anyone would have been condemned for so mild a work\r\nas the _Speculum astronomiae_, nor in 1277 could its contents have\r\nbeen regarded as “novelties.” Third, we have shown that Albert and not\r\nBacon wrote the _Speculum_. Fourth, we have already heard that in 1270\r\nAlbert sent a treatise to Paris to help Aquinas in connection with the\r\naffair of Siger de Brabant, and that in 1277 he came to Paris himself\r\nto defend his own Aristotelian teaching and the memory of Aquinas in\r\nconnection with the condemnation of the 219 articles. If so, who could\r\nhave been better fitted to write on that occasion as a representative\r\nboth of the Faith and of Philosophy than the venerable dean both of\r\nChristian theologians and of Aristotelian scientists?\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The _Speculum_ was written before 1277.]\r\n\r\nBut there is a serious objection to dating the _Speculum astronomiae_\r\nas late as 1277, especially if Albert is its author, as we have shown\r\nevery reason to believe. It is that the writer of the _Speculum_\r\nspeaks of the twelfth and thirteenth (meaning our thirteenth and\r\nfourteenth) books of the _Metaphysics_ of Aristotle as “not yet\r\ntranslated.”[2324] But Albert is acquainted with these books and\r\ngives a paraphrase of them in his own Commentary on the Metaphysics,\r\nwhich, as Mandonnet himself has elsewhere shown,[2325] was completed\r\nin 1256. It is true that Aquinas in his _De unitate intellectus contra\r\nAverroistas_, written in 1270, still seems to regard the last books\r\nof the _Metaphysics_ as untranslated,[2326] which leads Grabmann to\r\nargue that Albert must have revised his Commentary to include the last\r\nbooks of the _Metaphysics_ after 1270.[2327] But this fails to explain\r\nhow Albert or anyone else writing in 1277 or 1278 could still speak of\r\nthese books as “not yet translated,” since Albert could neither have\r\ntranslated nor commented upon them after 1277, since he died in 1280\r\nand Ptolemy of Lucca tells us that for about three years before his\r\ndeath his intellectual faculties had declined. Thus the _Speculum\r\nastronomiae_ was apparently written before 1277 and perhaps before 1256.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Condemnation of Siger de Brabant.]\r\n\r\nAlthough it thus appears to have no actual connection with the\r\n_Speculum astronomiae_, we may nevertheless consider here as bearing\r\non the same topic of theological opposition to certain occult arts\r\nand even to astrology, the condemnation in 1277 by Stephen, bishop of\r\nParis, and “doctors of sacred Scripture” of 219 opinions attributed\r\nto “Siger de Brabant, Boetius of Denmark, and others.” Siger seems to\r\nhave been an Averroist of somewhat pronounced type and to have held\r\nviews more evidently incompatible with the Christian Faith than most\r\nastrologers or occult scientists. It is possible, however, that his\r\nopponents misinterpreted or exaggerated his views. Mandonnet holds that\r\nhe would have disowned many of the articles, and that, on the other\r\nhand, his persecutors inserted also moderate opinions such as were held\r\nby Albertus Magnus and Aquinas, in an effort to give the impression\r\nthat infidels, Averroists, and moderate Aristotelians were all alike,\r\nand to discredit the reconciliation of Aristotle and Christian doctrine\r\nwhich Albert and Aquinas fathered.[2328] Dante speaks well of Siger in\r\nthe _Paradiso_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Condemned opinions connected with astrology; with science\r\nand religion.]\r\n\r\nWe may note those articles which bear upon astrology, a very\r\nconsiderable number, with the addition of a few concerned with the\r\nrelations of science and theology. It will be observed that the\r\nmoderate thirtieth article is scarcely consistent with some others, and\r\nthat the last clause of the 207th article, which seems an explanation\r\ninserted by the condemners, indicates that even they accept the\r\ninfluence of the stars within certain limits. In any case, while it\r\nis to be remembered that the condemnation is not primarily directed\r\nagainst astrology, the articles are of interest as showing both what\r\nadherents of astrology might believe and what its opponents might\r\naccuse them of and condemn them for.\r\n\r\n  “6.

An error, unless understood only of natural\r\n      results and by way of disposition.”[2332]\r\n\r\nIn our chapter on Raymond Lull we shall speak of a treatise written by\r\nhim in 1297 in which he deals with some of these opinions condemned in\r\n1277.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Other later moves against magic at Paris.]\r\n\r\nWith the condemnation in 1277 along with the opinions of Siger of\r\nBrabant of a geomancy, books of necromancy, and others containing\r\ninvocations of spirits, may be mentioned two later attempts of\r\nauthorities to discourage the study or practice of magic at Paris.\r\nOne, to which we have already alluded in our chapter on Roger Bacon,\r\nis a constitution of the Franciscans on May 25, 1292, forbidding their\r\nstudents at Paris to spend for other purposes the money sent them for\r\nbooks or to have curious books copied.[2333] We are, however, more\r\npained than surprised to learn that such a regulation was necessary in\r\nthe Order. The other is a letter of April 3, 1318, or 1319, of Pope\r\nJohn XXII to William, bishop of Paris, thanking him for a donation\r\nreceived and urging him to attend to the improvement of the University\r\nof Paris and especially to banish from it and from his diocese\r\n“nigromancers, diviners, poisoners, and others engaged in reprehensible\r\narts of this sort,” whom the pope further describes as criminals.[2334]\r\nThere is nothing to suggest that astrologers and their writings are\r\nincluded in either of these two later moves against superstitious arts\r\nor black magic.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[2284] Contained in Borgnet’s edition of Albert’s works, X, 629 _et\r\nseq._ This text, however, has been severely criticized by F. Cumont,\r\n_Cat. cod. astrol. graec._, V, i, 85, who says of it, “mendis scateat,”\r\nand who gives a partial version from the MSS (_Ibid._, pp. 86-105.)\r\n\r\nAn early edition among the incunabula of the British Museum (numbered\r\nI A. 8201) bears the different title, _Liber Alberti magni de duabus\r\nsapientiis et de recapitulatione omnium librorum astronomiae_.

Sighart, _Albertus Magnus, sein Leben und seine Wissenschaft_,\r\nRegensburg, 1857, p. 341 _et seq._ (Paris, 1862, p. 454 _et seq._)\r\naccepted Albert’s authorship.\r\n\r\nN.

In the _Vigintiloquium de concordantia\r\nastronomice veritatis cum theologia_, he says, “Unde Albertus\r\nMagnus perutiliter etiam tractatum edidit in quo vere astronomie et\r\nartis magice libros per eorum principia et fines distinxit.” In the\r\n_Apologetica defensio astronomice veritatis_ he cites “Albertus Magnus\r\nutique philosophus, astronomus, et theologus” concerning Albumasar’s\r\nplacing the birth of Christ under the sign Virgo, a passage alluded to\r\nin the _Speculum_, but not, as far as I have noted, in Albert’s other\r\nworks.\r\n\r\n[2297] Borgnet, X, 629.\r\n\r\n[2298] Quetif and Echard (1719), I, 173.\r\n\r\n[2299] Toward the close of its first book in his works as published at\r\nVenice in 1519 and in 1557: “Quod si mihi opponas Albertum theologum\r\npraestantissimum fautorem tamen astrologorum, admonebo te primum multa\r\nreferri in Albertum quae Alberti non sunt, quod et supra tetigimus.\r\nTunc si mihi forte obicias librum de licitis et illicitis, in quo\r\nreiicit quidem magos, astronomicos probat auctores, respondebo\r\nexistimari quidem a multis esse illud opus Alberti sed nec ipsum\r\nAlbertum nec libri inscriptionem usquequamquam hoc significare, cum\r\nauctor ipse quodcumque demum fuerit nomen suum consulto et expresso\r\ndissimulet.”\r\n\r\nAfter condemning certain statements in the _Speculum_ in favor of\r\nastronomical images and that magic books be not utterly destroyed, as\r\nunworthy of a learned man and a Christian, Pico concludes, “Quae utique\r\naut non scripsit Albertus, aut si scripsit, dicendum esse cum apostolo,\r\nin aliis laudo, in hoc non laudo.” Pico could hardly have read Albert’s\r\ndiscussion of astronomical images in the _Minerals_.\r\n\r\n[2300] Mandonnet (1910), p. 331, incorrectly cites this passage as a\r\ndefense of works of judicial astrology, a subject which is not broached\r\nuntil the following chapter of the _Speculum_.\r\n\r\n[2301] Cap. 12.\r\n\r\n[2302] Caps. 6-11.\r\n\r\n[2303] Digby 228 gives the number as “LXXII.”\r\n\r\n[2304] The Incipit given by the author of the _Speculum astronomiae_\r\nshows that this is the _Liber lune_ of which we have treated in our\r\nchapter on “Hermetic Books in the Middle Ages.” By a coincidence a\r\nportion of it is found in the same MS, Digby 228, fols. 54v-55v, with\r\nthe _Speculum_.\r\n\r\n[2305] This word is variously spelled in different MSS, for instance,\r\nin Digby 228, “Muhamethçaha”; in Canon.

Yet they are included in Albert’s _Commentary_, which Mandonnet\r\nhimself had dated in 1256!\r\n\r\n[2327] Grabmann (1916), pp. 163-9; the evidence presented for this view\r\nis not very convincing. The fourteen books of the _Metaphysics_ are\r\nfound in Latin in MSS dated by the catalogues in the 13th century: S.\r\nMarco X, 57, fols. 1-75, de metaphysica libri quatuordecim; Additional\r\n17345, late 13th century, according to the catalogue the _antiqua\r\ntranslatio_ ascribed to Thomas of Cantimpré.\r\n\r\n[2328] Mandonnet, _Siger de Brabant et l’averroïsme latin au XIIIe\r\nsiècle_, Fribourg, 1899, cap. 9.\r\n\r\n[2329] That this opinion was condemned in 1277 did not keep Peter\r\nof Abano from stating in his _Conciliator_ of 1303 that by power of\r\nfascination a man could be cast into a well and a camel into a hot\r\nbath.--Differentia 135. Indeed William of Auvergne, a previous bishop\r\nof Paris who had himself condemned “errors” in 1240, tells in his _De\r\nuniverso_ (II, iii, 16, edition of 1591, p. 986) of a man who cast down\r\na camel by merely imagining its fall.\r\n\r\n[2330] Which seems to contradict 102, which stated that “the celestial\r\ncircles are not instruments of intelligence but organs.”\r\n\r\n[2331] This opinion is, however, that of Boethius and most of the other\r\ndiscussions of fate which we have noted.\r\n\r\n[2332] The Latin text of the 219 opinions will be found in the\r\n_Chartularium Universitatis Parisiensis_, I, 543, _et seq._\r\n\r\n[2333] _Chartularium Universitatis Parisiensis_, II, 56-7.\r\n\r\n[2334] _Chart.

Quarto 189, on the verge of the 13th-14th centuries,\r\n   following fols. 40-67 Alberti Magni liber de mineralibus\r\n   et lapidibus, fols. 67-8 Notae de coloribus (fortasse\r\n   Alberti Magni tribuendae), and fol. 68 Notae variae, come\r\n   in a new hand at fols. 68-70 De imaginibus astronomicis,\r\n   and fol. 70 Notae ex capitulis speculi Alberti quibus de\r\n   imaginibus et de commendatione astronomiae inscribitur\r\n   extractae.\r\n\r\n Amplon. Quarto 223, late 14th century, fols. 105-116,\r\n   Tractatus de nominibus librorum astronomie cui inscribitur\r\n   _Speculum Alberti_ (Magni). “Explicit liber de nominibus\r\n   librorum astronomie dictus Speculum Alberti.”\r\n\r\n Amplon. Quarto 348, 1393 A. D., fols. 114-125, “Incipit\r\n   liber Alberti Magni episcopi Ratisponensis de libris\r\n   mathematice facultatis licitis et illicitis Erphordie\r\n   conscriptus ... / ... Finitus est Erphordie liber Alberti\r\n   de libris mathematice facultatis licitis et illicitis 1393\r\n   die 29 mensis Maii luna in capricorno et sole in geminis,”\r\n   etc.\r\n\r\n Amplon. Quarto 349, by two different hands of the mid-14th\r\n   century, fols. 98-108, “Liber de nominibus librorum\r\n   astronomie sive speculum domini Alberti.”\r\n\r\nThe following MSS in the Bibliothèque Nationale and Bodleian are those\r\nwhich I have personally examined:\r\n\r\n BN 7440, 14th century, fols. 1r-7r. The Speculum astronomiae\r\n   here opens without Titulus or Incipit but some later hand\r\n   has inserted, “Incipit speculum alberti prohemium.” Only\r\n   the bottom of the second column on fol. 1r is occupied\r\n   by the text of the Speculum, which is preceded by some\r\n   lines of text ending “Explicit liber hermetis” which are\r\n   the conclusion of the treatise on fifteen stars, stones,\r\n   and herbs at fols. 13v-16v. The Speculum is followed at\r\n   fol. 7r by the De urina non visa of William of England\r\n   or Marseilles and other astrological treatises. At fols.\r\n   38v-40v and 25r-32v is an astrological passage from what\r\n   is called in the headings at the tops of the pages “Meth’a\r\n   Rog’i” (Metaphysics of Roger), which Mr. Steele has\r\n   printed in Opera hactenus inedita Rogeri Baconi, Fasc. 1.\r\n   But the occurrence of this fragment in the same MS with\r\n   the Speculum can scarcely be adduced as any indication of\r\n   the Baconian authorship of the Speculum, since the same\r\n   later hand, which has here inserted “Incipit methafisica\r\n   Rogeri baconis de ordine predicatorum” (_sic!_), wrote in\r\n   the ascription of the Speculum to Albert.\r\n\r\n BN 7408, 15th century. Here the Speculum is bound at the\r\n   close of a MS containing astronomical and astrological\r\n   works. It is ascribed to Albert not only in the general\r\n   table of contents for the MS and in a Titulus written\r\n   at its beginning in another hand than its text, but the\r\n   text itself closes, “Expliciunt liber dicta speculum\r\n   alberti magni de nominibus librorum astronomie tam\r\n   demonstrativorum quam judicialium quem composuit frater\r\n   albertus ut sciatur qui libri sunt contra fidem et qui\r\n   non.” The same hand then goes on to cite Albert’s work on\r\n   minerals concerning images on stones.\r\n\r\n BN 7335, 15th century, fols. 108r-114v, “Incipit libellus\r\n   alberti magni de discretione astronomie a falsa aliter\r\n   intitulatus speculum ... / ... Explicit tractatus qui\r\n   dicitur speculum domini alberti.”\r\n\r\n Digby 228, 14th century, fol. 76-, no author is named in\r\n   the text itself of the Speculum but in the upper margin\r\n   of this page a hand of the same century has written the\r\n   following note: “Tractatus magistri Philippi cancellarii\r\n   Parisiensis de libris astronomie qui tenendi sunt secundum\r\n   integritatem fidei catholice et qui non.” This MS seems to\r\n   give a more correct text than any of the three following\r\n   other MSS in the Bodleian.\r\n\r\n Ashmole 345, later 14th century (the name, “Kenelme\r\n   Digby,” is written at the top of the first page of the\r\n   MS), fols. 14v-21, Tractatus in quo corriguntur errores\r\n   quorundam astrologorum et philosophorum fidei catholicae\r\n   repugnantes, “Occasione quorundam librorum apud quos non\r\n   est radix scientie ... / ... sed quod ambo inveniuntur ab\r\n   eodem creata. Explicit.” Although it opens as usual, it\r\n   omits much of the earlier chapters and bibliography of the\r\n   Speculum. No author seems to be named.\r\n\r\n Digby 81, on paper, fols. 102-18, “Explicit iste tractatus\r\n   quem composuit Albertus frater predicator.” But a hand of\r\n   the 17th century adds the note, “Albertus non fuit author\r\n   huius libri sed Philippus cancellarius Parisiensis, ut\r\n   ex vetustissimo exemplari manuscripto manifestum est,”\r\n   which I presume is a reference to the note to that effect\r\n   in Digby 228. As a table of contents for this portion of\r\n   the MS at fol. 101r shows, this “Albertus de scientiis\r\n   licitis et illicitis” was once followed by “Cosmographia\r\n   Rogeri Bacon”; but it will be noted that although the 17th\r\n   century hand questions Albert’s authorship, its writer was\r\n   not moved to ascribe the Speculum to Bacon.\r\n\r\n Canon. Misc. 517, 15th century, fols. 52v-59v, “Incipit\r\n   speculum alberti ... / ... finis Spectubili Alberti.”\r\n   Written in a print-like hand which is prettier than Digby\r\n   228, but the text nevertheless contains a good many slips,\r\n   as in the omission of words from the Incipits in the\r\n   bibliographies of deserving and illicit books. Also it has\r\n   19 chapters instead of the usual 17, as in Digby 228 and\r\n   the printed text.\r\n\r\nThe following MSS I have not examined but list according to the various\r\ncatalogues:\r\n\r\n Arsenal 387, 13th century, fols. 16-31. Fols. 15-34 are\r\n   now missing but in the 16th century Claude de Grandrue\r\n   gave the description: “Liber Alberti magni de nominibus\r\n   librorum astronomie tam demonstrativum quam judicialium,\r\n   ut sciatur qui libri sunt contra fidem et qui non.” The\r\n   correspondence of this wording with BN 7408 is perhaps\r\n   worth noting.\r\n\r\n Brussels, Library of Dukes of Burgundy, 936, anno 1418,\r\n   Alberti Maqui Speculum astronomiae; 1030, 15th century,\r\n   Alberti Magni Speculum; 1466, 15th century, an abridgement\r\n   of the Speculum.\r\n\r\n Florence, Ashburnham 136, early 15th century, fols. 178-83,\r\n   Speculum Alberti Magni.\r\n\r\n Catania 87, 15th century, #13, Albertus Magnus, Summa\r\n   librorum astronomiae.\r\n\r\n S.

Occasione quorundam\r\n   librorum....”\r\n\r\n Vienna 5508, 14-15th century, fols. 161v-180v, Speculum\r\n   geomanticum (the MS as a whole is largely devoted to\r\n   geomancy, but the opening words, “Occasione quorundam\r\n   librorum” identify it as our treatise).\r\n\r\n CU Trinity 1185, 16th century, fols. 1-7, Speculum Alberti\r\n   Magni, “Occasione quorundam librorum.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX II\r\n\r\nGERMATH OF BABYLON, GERGIS, AND GIRGITH\r\n\r\n\r\nGerma or Grema or Germath of Babylon is a name to which I believe\r\nI have met only one other reference, namely, in Ceceo d’Ascoli’s\r\n_Commentary on the De principiis of Alchabitius_ (ed. Boffito, p. 19),\r\nwhere for the assertion that the stone _anthrax_ keeps emitting water\r\nand so also has to attract water to supply the loss are cited “Evax rex\r\narabum et Zot grecus et Germa babilonensis.”\r\n\r\nIn another chapter of the _Speculum_ in listing licit works of\r\n“astronomy” the author mentions Gergis, _De significatione planetarum\r\nin domibus_, which opens, “Sol consurgit.” It is perhaps the same as\r\nAshmole 393, 15th century(?), fols. 68v-69v, “Gergis de significatione\r\nplanetarum ac capitis et caude in 12 domibus. Sol in ascendente\r\nsignificat principatum ... / ... neque dimittas que dico tibi nec\r\nproferes aliud. Explicit Jergis de significationibus planetarum in\r\ndomibus 12.” See also Steinschneider (1906) pp. 23-4, where other MSS\r\nof this treatise are mentioned and also of a “Girgic, De mansionibus\r\nlunae.” Other forms of the name than Gergis and Girgic mentioned\r\nby Steinschneider are Zergis, Jergis, Jargus (Hyargus, Largus) and\r\nGeorgius; also Gugit. Steinschneider further notes that this author\r\nappears in the alchemistic _Turba_; in which connection I may add\r\nthat Albertus Magnus in _Mineralium_ III, i, 4, speaks of a writer on\r\nalchemy from that part of Spain which used to belong to the Arabs named\r\nGilgil (Gilgil in secretis suis).\r\n\r\nSteinschneider does not note Royal 12-C-XVIII where, following the work\r\nof Thebit ben Corat on images, is “another tract on the same subject,\r\napparently by Jirgis ibn al-ʿAmid.

Manuscripts of the\r\n _De secretis mulierum_.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The three treatises.]\r\n\r\nIf we have succeeded in showing that there is little reason for\r\nquestioning the traditional ascription of the _Speculum astronomiae_\r\nto Albertus Magnus, and still less reason for attributing it to anyone\r\nelse, it must on the other hand be admitted that the authenticity\r\nof three other treatises current under his name is more dubious.\r\nTo the consideration of these three treatises we now come, namely,\r\nthe _Experimenta Alberti_, _De mirabilibus mundi_, and _De secretis\r\nmulierum_. _The Experiments of Albert_, or _The Secrets of Albert_\r\n(_Secreta Alberti_), as it is usually called in the manuscripts, in the\r\nprinted editions is generally entitled _Liber aggregationis_, or the\r\nbook of secrets or virtues of certain herbs, animals, and stones.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Are the two treatises on magic by Albert?]\r\n\r\nWhen Albertus Magnus in his treatises on the works of Aristotle in\r\nnatural philosophy dismissed certain matters as pertaining to the\r\nscience of magic rather than to physical science, and said that they\r\nshould be considered in other treatises, it is just possible that\r\nhe intended to write such books himself. He does not, however, seem\r\nto have cited any such writings of his own by title in any of his\r\nundisputedly genuine works. Such writings are nevertheless extant\r\nunder his name, namely, the above-mentioned _Experiments of Albert_\r\nand _Marvels of the Universe_. These two treatises already circulated\r\nunder his name in the middle ages and appeared in numerous editions\r\nin the early years of the printing-press.[2335] Indeed, a survey\r\nof the catalogue in such a library as the British Museum indicates\r\nthat these treatises were published in about as many editions as all\r\nAlbert’s numerous other works put together. This suggests how much\r\nmore popular were these brief collections of superstitious experiments\r\nand sensational marvels than Albert’s longer, more difficult and\r\nargumentative, theological and scientific writings.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Manuscripts of the _Experiments_.]\r\n\r\nOf these two treatises the _Liber aggregationis_ or _Experiments_ or\r\n_Secrets of Albert_ is found in a number of manuscripts of the British\r\nMuseum, Bodleian, and other libraries.[2336] These are dated in the\r\ncatalogues as mainly of the thirteenth, fourteenth, and fifteenth\r\ncenturies. The text is not uniform either in the printed editions or\r\nthe manuscripts. Some manuscripts contain only part of the treatise\r\nor arrange its items in a different order, and sometimes foreign\r\nmatter is interpolated, but it is clear that they are all different\r\nportions or versions of one work. Indeed the three Digby manuscripts\r\nin the Bodleian contain practically the same text, and would seem to\r\nbe copies of one another or of a common original, since an illegible\r\nphrase in one is apt to be equally unreadable in the rest. They also\r\nall entitle the work the _Secrets_ rather than the _Experiments of\r\nAlbert_. Most of the manuscripts expressly attribute the work to Albert\r\nwho is variously styled “Albertus Magnus,” “Brother Albert,” “Brother\r\nAlbert of the Order of Preachers,” or “Brother Albert of Cologne of the\r\nOrder of Preaching Friars.” One manuscript says that Albertus Magnus\r\ntranslated these experiments with herbs, stones, and animals from the\r\nGreek and Arabic. Only one of the manuscripts, where a part of the\r\nexperiments with herbs are called _Jocalia Salamonis_, ascribes the\r\nwork to anyone else than Albert. Borgnet, who did not include either\r\nthe _De mirabilibus mundi_ or _Liber aggregationis_ in his edition of\r\nAlbert’s works, mentions another manuscript where the latter treatise\r\nis ascribed to “Brother Albert of Saxony.” But aside from the fact\r\nthat the evidence of a single manuscript is worth little against so\r\nmany others, if we find the _Experiments_ and _Secrets_ in manuscripts\r\nof the thirteenth and early fourteenth centuries, the work cannot\r\npossibly be written by Albert of Saxony who did not flourish until\r\nabout 1351 to 1361. Moreover, in the fourteenth century manuscripts\r\nour treatise is found with other experimental and occult treatises\r\nof varied authors, so that it would appear to have been known for\r\nsome time and copied from earlier manuscripts into these collections.\r\nWhether the treatise is by Albert or not, then, there seems no doubt\r\nthat it was generally ascribed to him in the later middle ages, and\r\nthat it was composed in the thirteenth century, or at least that the\r\nnucleus of it existed then.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Manuscripts of the _Marvels_.]\r\n\r\nOf the _De mirabilibus mundi_ manuscripts seem much rarer.[2337] I\r\nfound none in the British Museum, although it contains so many of\r\nthe _Experiments of Albert_ which almost invariably accompanies the\r\n_Marvels_ in the printed editions. It is also rather remarkable that\r\nthe former treatise is always called the _Experiments_ or _Secrets of\r\nAlbert_ in the manuscripts, and _Liber aggregationis_ in the printed\r\neditions.[2338]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Evidence of a fourteenth century bibliography.]\r\n\r\nFurther evidence that the _Experiments_ was at least attributed to\r\nAlbert at an early date and on the other hand that the _De mirabilibus\r\nmundi_ was not, is afforded by the bibliography of works by learned\r\nDominicans drawn up in the second quarter of the fourteenth century.\r\nHere we find listed among Albert’s writings[2339] a _De lapidibus\r\net herbis_ which may well be the _Experimenta_, since his _De\r\nvegetabilibus et plantis_ and _De mineralibus_ are listed separately,\r\nand a _Secretum secretorum Alberti_ which may indicate either the\r\n_Experiments_ or _Secrets_ or perhaps the _De secretis mulierum_. On\r\nthe other hand, in the same bibliography we find a _De mirabilibus_\r\nlisted not among the writings of Albertus Magnus but attributed to an\r\nArnold of Liège.[2340] Perhaps this is why Berthelot states, without\r\ngiving any reference or reason, that the _De mirabilibus mundi_ was\r\nwritten in the fourteenth century by a pupil of Albertus Magnus.[2341]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Opinions of modern writers.]\r\n\r\nIn modern times some writers have accepted these two treatises\r\nas Albert’s, perhaps unthinkingly, while others have rejected\r\nthem as spurious. Thus Cockayne gives the description of the herb\r\n_Heliotropium_ from the _De virtutibus herbarum_, another name for the\r\n_Experiments_ or _Liber aggregationis_, as by Albertus Magnus.[2342]\r\nAnd we find Hoefer reproving Haller and Sprengel for having judged\r\nAlbertus Magnus too severely on the basis of the same _De viribus\r\nherbarum_, “a book of cabalistic recipes” which Hoefer asserts is not\r\nhis.[2343] Borgnet who, as has been said, excluded our two treatises\r\nfrom his edition of Albert’s works, held that the “vain and futile\r\nmatters” which they contain are enough to prove that they cannot be\r\nby Albert. Of this the reader may judge for himself by comparing\r\nsome of the passages concerning occult virtue, astrology, magic,\r\nand experiments with toads and emeralds which we have already cited\r\nfrom Albert’s works with those which we shall soon give from these\r\ntwo treatises. As the _Histoire Littéraire de la France_ says in its\r\narticle on Albert, “It must be confessed that all his treatises let\r\nbe seen too often his leaning toward the occult sciences; and they\r\ncontain, at least in part, the germ of the wretched productions falsely\r\npublished under his name.”[2344]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Meyer’s argument against the authenticity of the\r\n_Experiments_.]\r\n\r\nMeyer in his _History of Botany_[2345] made more detailed objections\r\nto the Albertine authorship of the _Liber aggregationis_. He argued\r\nthat Albert’s genuine works display a more elegant style and logical\r\narrangement, that the _Liber aggregationis_ does not depend on\r\nAristotle as the genuine scientific works do, and that Albert elsewhere\r\ncondemns the magic which he here expounds. But we have shown that\r\nAlbert does not always condemn even so-called magic in his other\r\nwritings, that it is not inconceivable that he may have written\r\ntreatises on natural magic himself, and that he follows Aristotle only\r\nwhere he has works of Aristotle at hand to follow. Argument from style\r\nis always dangerous, since style is apt to alter with the subject and\r\nmethod of a treatise. Furthermore, Meyer seems to have judged the\r\nstyle of the _Liber aggregationis_ from the printed text which often\r\ndiffers in wording from the manuscripts. However, I do not know that\r\ntheir style is any more elegant; the manuscripts are hard to read and\r\noften seem incoherent. In any case the treatise is mainly a collection\r\nof brief statements, largely excerpted from other writings, with\r\nlittle room either for literary elegance or logical arrangement. Meyer\r\nfurther noted, however, that the _Liber aggregationis_ gave a different\r\nexplanation of two names of herbs, _Quinquefolium_ and _Jusquiasmus_\r\n(or _Jusquiamus_), from that given in Albert’s _On vegetables and\r\nplants_. Even this divergence might, however, be due to Albert’s\r\nhaving followed different authorities in the two works; the _Liber\r\naggregationis_ or _Experiments_ seems to draw largely from _Kiranides_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Difficulty of the question.]\r\n\r\nIt may be admitted that the _Experiments_ and _Marvels_ seem in general\r\nrather inferior to Albert’s undisputed works, which embody the same\r\nsort of superstitions, it is true, but are less exclusively devoted to\r\nthat sort of thing. But we must expect treatises which deal expressly\r\nwith magic and marvels to be more superstitious than those which deal\r\nprofessedly with Aristotelian theories and facts learned by experience\r\nconcerning the natural sciences. Compare the writings of Sir Oliver\r\nLodge on physics and on psychic research. And if the _Experiments_ and\r\nmost of the _Marvels_ seem naïve, simple, and unsophisticated compared\r\nto the more elaborate arrangement and detail and scholastic argument\r\nof the undisputed works of Albert, it is to be noted that they are\r\nlike other books of their kind, just as the others are like other\r\nAristotelian and scholastic treatises. But from these difficult and\r\nhypothetical questions of authenticity or spuriousness let us turn to\r\nthe writings themselves.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Introduction of the _Experiments_.]\r\n\r\nMeyer said that in the _Liber aggregationis_ one did not find Albert’s\r\nchief source, Aristotle. Yet the _Experiments of Albert_ open in the\r\nmanuscripts with the words, “As the philosopher says,” to which one\r\nmanuscript adds, “in the first book of the _Metaphysics_.”[2346] The\r\nphilosopher’s dictum was to the effect that all science is good but\r\nthat it may be employed either for good or evil ends. Our author then\r\naffirms that “magical science”[2347] is not evil, since by knowledge\r\nof it one can avoid evil and secure good. This is not unlike the way\r\nin which Albert in his _Minerals_ justified the science of images as\r\ngood doctrine, even if it was a part of necromancy, or showed in other\r\npassages that astrology was not contrary to freedom of the will since\r\nit enabled one to avoid evils and to obtain goods. By this statement\r\nthe author also serves notice that magical science or the science of\r\nmagic is to be the subject of the present treatise. Continuing his\r\npreface, he mentions “inspection of reasons and natural experiments” as\r\nwell as “ancient authors” or “doctors” as sources. He has tested many\r\nof the statements of these authorities and has found truth in many of\r\nthem. In the present treatise he intends to make use of the book of\r\nKiranides and the book of Alcorath, later said to be by Hermes, and\r\nto speak first of certain herbs, then of certain stones and certain\r\nanimals and of their virtues. The oldest manuscript that I have seen\r\nalso promises to treat of the virtue of words,[2348] but this promise\r\nis not fulfilled and is omitted in the printed text. It may also be\r\nremarked now that other authorities than Kiranides and Alcorath are\r\ncited in the course of the treatise.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Virtues of herbs, stones, and animals.]\r\n\r\nThe author then considers sixteen herbs,[2349] about forty-five\r\nstones,[2350] and some eighteen animals,[2351] many of which are\r\nbirds. In the printed text and some manuscripts there are also given\r\nthe virtues of seven herbs according to the emperor Alexander, which\r\nis really a distinct treatise of which we have spoken elsewhere. The\r\nnames are sometimes given in several languages after the manner of the\r\n_Herbarium_ of the Pseudo-Apuleius. Thus a treatise which began with\r\njustification of magical science turns out to be simply a treatment\r\nof the virtues of natural objects. But this shows the importance\r\nof natural objects in magic, and the virtues here ascribed to them\r\nare often indeed magical. One may become invisible, escape dangers,\r\ntravel in safety, conquer the enemy, win honors, not feel pain, boil\r\nwater instantly or freeze boiling water or kindle an inextinguishable\r\nfire, make a rainbow appear or the sun seem blood-red, excite love\r\nbetween two persons, or arouse joy, sadness, and other emotional and\r\nintellectual states, overpower wild beasts, interpret any dream, and\r\nprophesy concerning the future. In brief, by the aid of the occult\r\nvirtues of these natural objects one can accomplish almost anything\r\nthat any other form of magic could procure. Two or three examples may\r\nbe given in more detail.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The heliotrope.]\r\n\r\nThe first herb discussed, the heliotrope, if plucked when the sun is\r\nin the sign Leo in August and worn wrapped in a laurel leaf with the\r\ntooth of a wolf, insures that the bearer of it will be addressed with\r\nnone but friendly words. If a person who has been robbed sleeps with\r\nit beneath his pillow, he will see all the circumstances of the theft\r\nrepeated in his dreams. If it is placed in a temple, women who have\r\nbeen unfaithful to their marriage vows will be unable to leave the\r\ntemple until this herb is removed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The lily.]\r\n\r\nThe lily is an herb which the _Magi_ have greatly lauded. It, too,\r\nshould be plucked when the sun is in Leo, then mixed with laurel juice\r\nand buried beneath ordure until worms are generated therefrom. No one\r\ncan sleep in whose clothing or about whose neck is sprinkled some of\r\nthe powder made from these worms. Anyone anointed with this powder will\r\ncontract a fever. If this powder is put in a jar of milk covered with\r\nthe skin of a cow of one color, the entire herd will cease to give\r\nmilk. “And this has been tested in our time by certain sorcerers.”[2352]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Two gems.]\r\n\r\nThe stone Optalmius, wrapped in a laurel leaf, renders one invisible,\r\nas its virtue blinds the sight of onlookers. By its aid Constantine\r\nbecame invisible in the thick of the fight. A test of virginity by the\r\nstone Galerites is ascribed to Avicenna. In operating with stones the\r\nbearer of the gem should be free from all pollution in order to secure\r\na good result, a magic commonplace.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The owl.]\r\n\r\nIf the heart and right foot of an owl are placed upon a sleeper’s\r\nbreast, “he will tell whatever he has done and whatever you ask\r\nhim.”[2353] “And this was tested experimentally by our brothers\r\nrecently.”[2354] No dog will bark at a person who carries these same\r\nparts of an owl in his armpit, and together with an owl’s wing they\r\nwill attract all sorts of birds to a tree where they are suspended.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Evax and Aaron, and the crow.]\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note that Evax and Aaron, who were cited in\r\nAlbert’s _Minerals_, are here cited for the virtues of animals as\r\nwell, the crow, taxo, and hare.[2355] Their crow story, however, also\r\nconcerns a stone. If a crow’s eggs are cooked and then replaced in the\r\nnest, the bird flies away to the Red Sea and returns with a stone whose\r\ntouch turns the eggs raw again. This stone is valuable to human beings\r\nfor other purposes. Set in a ring with the usual laurel leaf, its touch\r\nopens closed gates and frees prisoners from their chains. If one puts\r\nit in one’s mouth, one can understand the language of the birds. One\r\nmanuscript[2356] speaks of this procedure with the crow’s eggs as an\r\nexperiment of a master Dacus, rather than of Aaron and Evax, and says\r\nthat the stone brought by the crow aids conception. To have a male\r\nchild the stone should be held in the right hand; in the left, for a\r\nfemale.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Observance of astrology.]\r\n\r\nAstrological conditions had to be observed in some of the procedure\r\nalready recounted. In conclusion the general principle is also laid\r\ndown apart from any particular recipe, that to work a good effect\r\none should operate under the influence of a benevolent planet like\r\nJupiter or Venus, and to work an evil effect under a malevolent planet.\r\n“Whoever observes this rule correctly will without doubt find truth and\r\nthe greatest efficacy in what we have said, as I have experienced with\r\nour brothers.”[2357]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Emphasis upon experiment.]\r\n\r\nThis last expression and others like it which have been previously\r\nnoted, together with the title, _Experimenta Alberti_, attest the\r\nexperimental character of our treatise, which is to be classed as\r\none of those “books of experiments” or “experimental books” which\r\nwe have heard so often mentioned and of which our next two chapters\r\nwill especially treat. This expression and its fellows further remind\r\nus--perhaps are intended to remind us--of Albert’s allusions to the\r\npersonal experiences of himself or his _socii_ in his undisputed works.\r\nIf our treatise is not by Albert, there can at least be little doubt\r\nthat it pretends to be a product of his experimental school among the\r\nDominicans at Cologne.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _De mirabilibus mundi_ is more theoretical.]\r\n\r\nThe _Marvels of the Universe_ contains more theoretical discussion\r\nof much the usual scholastic sort than the _Experiments_, and so\r\napproximates rather more nearly to the form of most of Albert’s works.\r\nAs against the brief introductory paragraph of the _Experiments_, the\r\n_Marvels_ enters upon a long and learned preliminary discussion of the\r\nvalidity, causes, and principles of magic before beginning its list of\r\nparticular marvels.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: How account for magic?]\r\n\r\nThe author states that after he knew “that the work of the wise man is\r\nto make marvels cease” by scientific explanation of them, he searched\r\nthe writings of authorities until he understood the causes of most\r\nmarvelous works. One extremely marvelous thing, however, continued to\r\npuzzle him, yet its existence he regards as evident to all men, even\r\nthe vulgar. This was the binding of men by incantations, characters,\r\nsorcery, words, and by many quite common objects. For this he could\r\nfind no sufficient cause and it seemed impossible. But after he had\r\npuzzled long, he found a plausible statement by Avicenna in the sixth\r\nbook of the _Naturalia_ that there exists in the human mind a certain\r\npower of altering objects, and that other objects obey the human mind\r\nwhen it is aroused to a great excess of love or hatred toward anyone\r\nof them. In such circumstances manifest experience shows that the\r\nmind can bind and alter objects as it desires. The author, however,\r\nfor a long time remained still incredulous. But when he came to read\r\nbooks of necromancy and images and magic, he found in them this same\r\ntheory that the human soul can alter its own body or exterior objects,\r\nespecially if its influence concurs with a favorable astrological hour.\r\nMoreover, men differ in their natural capacity to influence others or\r\nto be influenced by them. Some men cannot be bewitched; others cannot\r\nbe freed from the power which another has established over them; still\r\nothers can both be bewitched and set free from sorcery.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Action of characters explained.]\r\n\r\nThe discussion then turns for a time from magical influence in general\r\nto that of characters in particular. Their force depends upon the power\r\nof the mind of the operator and the celestial virtue at the time of\r\ntheir construction. A distinction is made between characters written\r\nblindly in a frenzy and those constructed scientifically with some\r\nlikeness to the object sought, as when embracing figures are placed in\r\na love charm. Such scientific characters our author prefers as more\r\nrational and possessing greater virtue. He states that later he will\r\nlist from various books particular characters and words for making or\r\ndestroying this or that.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Incredible “experiments of authorities” upheld.]\r\n\r\nResuming his more general discussion, the author defends “the many\r\nexperiments of authorities,”--a phrase which should warn us against\r\nattempting sharply to distinguish between medieval trust in authorities\r\nand medieval experimental tendencies. Some deem these “experiments\r\nof authorities” incredible, but he supports them as “most certain\r\nscience.” His argument therefor is the too subtle and ingenious\r\nplea that surely no philosopher would purposely write such apparent\r\nfalsehoods, unless he were sure of their truth, since even an ignorant\r\nman does not willingly write what is manifestly false. Hence these\r\nseemingly incredible statements must be true.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Laws of nature and of magic.]\r\n\r\nThe author then lays down some general laws of nature such as that\r\nevery species seeks its kind, fire moving toward fire, and water\r\ntoward water. Also that an object is gradually changed into likeness\r\nto its surroundings. Thus Avicenna says that an object turns to salt\r\nwhen it has stood in salt for a long time; and if wild animals remain\r\nlong with men, they become domesticated. Philosophers have discovered\r\n“the dispositions of natural entities,” such as heat, cold, boldness,\r\nwrath, fear, sterility, the ardor of love, or any other virtue. For\r\ninstance, audacity is a quality innate in all members of the lion\r\nspecies. Knowledge of these innate qualities is of great assistance in\r\nmarvelous and secret operations. Another great law is that like loves\r\nlike. Medical men, alchemists, and scientists generally verify this\r\nassertion. Furthermore, “every nature, particular or general, has a\r\nnatural friendship or enmity for some other, and some have this for the\r\nentire species and for all time, while others have it for an individual\r\nonly and for a fixed time.” Proof of this is to be seen in the case of\r\ncertain animals who hate each other in life and whose parts, even whose\r\nhairs, retain this repugnance after death. Thus the lion’s skin injures\r\nall other pelts; while sheepskin is consumed by wolfskin, and a drum\r\nmade of the latter silences one made of the former.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Man’s magic power.]\r\n\r\nThe author then returns to the magic power in man. He believes that it\r\nis clear to everyone that man is the end of all nature and should be\r\nsupreme over it. Man possesses all the marvelous virtues to be found\r\nthroughout the natural world; even the demons obey him; “and in the\r\nvery human body all the secret arts are worked and ... every marvel\r\nissues from it.” All these powers, however, are not found in one man\r\nat the same time, but in different individuals at different times. The\r\ndetails of this relationship of man to the world of nature are revealed\r\nnot by reason but by experience,--a Galenic and Albertine distinction\r\nof which the author of the _De mirabilibus mundi_ is quite fond.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A wonderful world.]\r\n\r\nEverything in nature is equally full of marvelous virtue. Fires are\r\nnot more marvelous than waters, the virtues of pepper are no greater\r\nthan those of jusquiam. One cannot dispute this, whether one attributes\r\nmarvelous virtues primarily to the action of heat and cold, or to love\r\nand enmity between things, or to the influence of the stars, for all\r\nthings in nature are subject alike to these three forces. Now, “when\r\nphilosophers realized that everything was wonderful, they began to\r\nexperiment and to bring forth what there is in things.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The chief causes of marvels.]\r\n\r\nThe author, for his part, cannot agree with those philosophers and\r\nmedical men who have tried to explain everything in terms of hot and\r\ncold, dry and moist. He declares that they met with many phenomena\r\nin the course of their experience which they could not verify upon\r\nthis basis, so that “they marveled and were sorrowful incessantly,\r\nand often denied something although they saw it.” On the other hand,\r\nour author does not agree with the astrologers that everything can be\r\nexplained by the course of the stars. He prefers the view of “Plato and\r\nAristotle and the orthodox (_legitimi_) and all who pursue the ultimate\r\nphilosophy” that there are diverse causes or channels of marvelousness\r\n(_mirabilibus_). Often marvels are produced by the impression of the\r\nstars, often by heat and cold, often by the virtues of demons and\r\nnecromancers, often by virtues innate in objects and implanted with\r\ntheir substantial forms, often by the relationship of things to one\r\nanother. This is why Plato says _in libro tegimenti_ (or, _regiminis_)\r\nthat one who is not trained in dialectic, natural science, astrology,\r\nand necromancy--“in which are revealed the immaterial substances\r\nwhich dispense and administer all that is in things for good or for\r\nevil”--can explain neither what the philosophers have written nor\r\nwhat the senses perceive, and will depart sadly, unable to solve\r\nthe problems of the marvelous. Our author also warns his readers to\r\ndistinguish between the effects, often contrary, of substance and\r\naccident, and to remember that action is sometimes direct, sometimes\r\nindirect.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Marvels proved by experience, not by reason.]\r\n\r\nFinally, before beginning his list of specific marvels, the author\r\nreverts to his point concerning reason and experience, citing the\r\n_liber tegimenti_ again to the effect that some things for which we can\r\ngive no reason are nevertheless manifest to the senses, while others\r\nwhich we perceive by no sense or sensation are manifest to the reason.\r\nAs usual the power of the magnet is adduced as an example of things\r\nproved by experience for which reason cannot account. “So no one should\r\ndeny what the philosophers have affirmed from experience until he has\r\ntested it in the manner of the philosophers who discovered it.” It is\r\nalso pointed out that many of the ancients told marvelous things which\r\nare now verified and generally accepted. “And I will tell you some in\r\norder that you may strengthen your mind on them and be prepared to\r\nbelieve what reason cannot confirm.” With this the list of particular\r\nmarvels opens.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Borrowing from the _Liber vaccae_ of Pseudo-Plato suggested\r\nby the authorities cited.]\r\n\r\nAt first authorities are cited a good deal; philosophers in general,\r\nGalen, Hermes, the Arabian medical writer _filius Mesue_ or Yuhanna\r\nibn Masawaih,[2358] the Pseudo-Aristotle and Alexander, whose feat\r\nis mentioned of killing the vipers with the deadly glance by erecting\r\nmirrors for them to look themselves to death in. Less familiar\r\nnames are Architas, Belbinus--who, however, is perhaps the same as\r\nthe Belenus of the _Speculum astronomiae_, Tabariensis, a _Book of\r\nDecoration_, and the books of Archigenes and Cleopatra, two authors\r\ncited by Galen. These same names of authors, with precisely the same\r\nstatements cited from each and with a similar preceding argument about\r\nproving marvels by experience, occur also in the _Liber vaccae_ or\r\n_Liber aggregationum anguemis_ or _Liber institutionum activorum_,\r\nascribed to Plato and Galen,[2359] and of which we shall treat in a\r\nsubsequent chapter. As this _Liber Anguemis_ seems to have been known\r\nto William of Auvergne and to date back in Latin translation to the\r\ntwelfth century, the _De mirabilibus mundi_ would seem to have copied\r\nfrom it, especially as its citations of _Plato in libro tegimenti_ (or\r\n_regiminis_), which I suspected had some connection with Galen before\r\nI became acquainted with the _Liber Anguemis_, may be meant for that\r\nwork, of which both Plato and Galen are reputed authors. It should\r\nbe noted, however, that these citations and the passage introductory\r\nto them are entirely absent from one manuscript[2360] of the _Liber\r\nvaccae_ or _Liber Anguemis_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Contents of the _Marvels_ characterized.]\r\n\r\nIn the specific marvels ligatures and suspensions are employed to a\r\nlarge extent, as are parts of animals: the skin of a wolf or dog, the\r\nblood of a hare, bird, bat, or male turtle, the urine of a mule, and\r\nthe wax from a dog’s left ear. There are a number of cures for quartan\r\nfever and some for other diseases, and various methods are recommended\r\nto prevent conception. The philosophers are represented as saying that\r\nif flies are submerged in water, they appear dead, but if they are\r\nburied in ashes, they will rise again. _The Book of Cleopatra_ advises\r\na husband whose wife does not love him to wear the marrow from a wolf’s\r\nleft foot, “and she will love none but you.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A mixture of chemistry and magic.]\r\n\r\nToward the end of the treatise authorities are no longer cited and many\r\nof the recipes aim at magical or optical illusions and the fabrication\r\nof marvelous candles, lights, and combustibles. Some are perhaps akin\r\nto modern fireworks and chemical rather than magical. They terminate at\r\nany rate with a recipe for Greek fire and other explosives, including\r\nperhaps gunpowder. Instructions are given how to make men appear\r\nheadless or with three heads or with the face of a dog or the head of\r\nan ass or any animal you wish, or in the form of angels or black men or\r\nelephants and great horses. Also how to write letters which can be read\r\nonly at night, how to make a chicken or other animal dance in a dish,\r\nhow to make the whole house seem full of snakes, how to make oneself\r\nseem on fire from head to foot, how to cast an object into the flames\r\nwithout burning it, how to enable men to walk through fire or carry\r\na hot iron uninjured, how to extinguish a lamp by opening the hands\r\nover it and how to light it by closing them. Other recipes enable one\r\nto catch birds in the hands, to inward off dogs and snakes, to break\r\na love charm, to loose bonds, see the future in sleep, catch a mole,\r\nand force a confession from a woman. To make a man forever a eunuch\r\none should give him a glow-worm in drink. “And they say that if anyone\r\nis anointed with ass’s milk, all the fleas in the house will gather on\r\nhim.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Two specimens of combustibles.]\r\n\r\nThe following is a specimen of the more superstitious type of recipe\r\nfor a candle or combustible. From the first part of the human head,\r\ncalled _sinciput_ by the philosophers, worms are generated soon after\r\ndeath. After seven days the worms become flies and after fourteen days\r\nthey are great dragons whose bite is instantaneously fatal to man. “If\r\nyou take one of these and cook it with oil and make a candle of it with\r\na wick of crape, you will thereby behold with great fear a great thing\r\nand indescribable forms.” In contrast to this recipe may be quoted\r\none of three for making “flying fire” out of sulphur, charcoal, and\r\nsaltpeter. “Take a pound of sulphur, two pounds of willow charcoal, six\r\npounds of saltpeter. Grind them very fine on a marble stone. Then put\r\nsome in a cover of flying-paper or thunder-making paper. The cover for\r\nflying should be long, thin, and well filled with that powder, but for\r\nthunder-making short, thick, and half filled.” Here we would seem to\r\nhave gunpowder and fireworks described.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Further discussion of marvelousness in general.]\r\n\r\nIn three of the four _incunabula_ editions of the _De mirabilibus\r\nmundi_ which I have examined there occurs toward the close of the\r\ntreatise another passage discussing marvelousness in general, most of\r\nwhich is not contained in the later editions although they briefly\r\nindicate its main point. The author says that now he understands that\r\na thing is marvelous only as long as most persons cannot detect its\r\ncause, and that when a sufficient cause for it is shown, everyone\r\nceases to wonder at it. He then distinguishes three kinds of marvels:\r\nfirst, those of rare occurrence in which not only is the cause unknown\r\nbut the phenomenon itself marvelous from its very rarity; second, those\r\nwhose cause is unknown, although the phenomena are neither new nor\r\nunusual; third, those whose cause is not entirely unknown but seems\r\ninsufficient to account for the result. To produce any marvelous effect\r\nthe requisites are a strong agent and a well-disposed material or\r\npatient. Sometimes, even when the agent is weak, the unusual aptitude\r\nof the patient compensates for this. On the basis of this scholastic\r\ngeneralization the author goes on to advise that, in working any marvel\r\nin the presence of the vulgar, one should center their attention upon\r\nsome weak factor which alone is manifestly insufficient to produce\r\nthe desired result and conceal the other contributory factors in the\r\nexperiment as far as possible.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The _Marvels_ is an experimental book.]\r\n\r\nIf the _Marvels_ is a more theoretical treatise than the _Experiments_,\r\nit is none the less almost equally experimental in character. Its\r\nparticular marvels are also put in the form of experiments, and even\r\nin the more scholastic and reasoned introduction and conclusion\r\nthe author, as we have seen, constantly appeals to experience, and\r\nclosely associates experimentation and magic by such phrases as “all\r\nthe marvelousness of experiments and marvels.” He also employs the\r\nverb _experimentari_ as well as the classical form _experiri_, thus\r\nsuggesting definitely that he means “to experiment” and not merely\r\n“to experience.” The _De mirabilibus mundi_, in fine, as well as the\r\n_Experimenta Alberti,_ belongs to the category of “books of experiment”\r\nor “experimental books” which we have heard William of Auvergne and\r\nthe _Speculum astronomiae_ mention, and to which our next two chapters\r\nwill be further devoted. Some of the items of the _De mirabilibus\r\nmundi_ will be found duplicated or closely paralleled in these other\r\nexperimental books, as we have already noted in the case of the _Liber\r\nvaccae_ or _Liber Anguemis_, and as Berthelot, in editing _The Book of\r\nFires_ of Marcus Grecus, noted that a number of its experiments were\r\nfound also in the _De mirabilibus mundi_.[2361]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _De secretis mulierum._]\r\n\r\nWith the later editions of the _Liber aggregationis_ and _De\r\nmirabilibus mundi_ there was usually published a third treatise\r\nascribed to Albertus Magnus which had already been printed separately,\r\nnamely, _The Secrets of Women_. I am not quite sure whether this\r\ntreatise was put on the _Index Expurgatorius_ because it had become too\r\npopular, or whether its popularity was increased rather than diminished\r\nby this official censure. At any rate the number of extant manuscripts\r\nshows that it was well known before the _Index_ was ever instituted.\r\nPossibly one reason for questioning the authenticity of the two\r\ntreatises which we have just considered was the ill-repute into which\r\nthey came in consequence of being so often bound with the _De secretis\r\nmulierum_. Also its history and the question of its genuineness or\r\nspuriousness may throw some light, if only by way of illustration and\r\nanalogy, upon the same problem in their case. Moreover, if the _De\r\nsecretis mulierum_ is by Albert or one of his disciples, it affords\r\nsome further illustrations of the belief in occult virtue and astrology\r\nof himself or his pupils; and if not, it at least shows what a great\r\ninterest such doctrines had for a large number of readers during the\r\ncenturies from the fourteenth to eighteenth inclusive. It is not,\r\nhowever, either a book of magic or an experimental book like the two\r\ntreatises which we have just considered.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The problem of its authorship.]\r\n\r\n_The Secrets of Women_ was printed before 1500[2362] and in all has\r\nappeared in about as many editions as the other two treatises. Choulant\r\ncounted over thirty editions of each.[2363] The _De secretis mulierum_\r\nis found in several manuscripts, chiefly of the fourteenth century,\r\nin the medieval collection of Amplonius at Erfurt, and in numerous\r\nother manuscripts at Munich, Berlin, Wolfenbüttel, and Vienna.[2364]\r\nApparently the treatise originated in Germany, whether by the hand of\r\nAlbert or not, and remained a favorite there. A translation into German\r\nwas made for the Count Palatine of the Rhine.[2365] Although sometimes\r\nno author is named in manuscripts of the _De secretis mulierum_, in the\r\ncase of those of Amplonius of the fourteenth century one infers from\r\nSchum’s descriptions that the work is ascribed to Albertus Magnus and\r\nto no one else. Thus no support is given by these early manuscripts\r\nto the theory of Simlerus, Meyer, and Borgnet that the treatise\r\nshould be attributed to Henry of Saxony, a disciple of Albert whose\r\nwritings contain many excerpts from Albert’s, because in some old\r\nprinted editions the work is assigned to him.[2366] This ascription to\r\nHenry of Saxony has already been well characterized by V. Rose in his\r\nCatalogue of the Latin manuscripts at Berlin as “a pure invention of\r\nthe editor”[2367] of the printed edition of 1499, which the manuscripts\r\nclearly contradict. Thomas of Cantimpré, who devotes some chapters of\r\nhis _De natura rerum_ to gynecology has also been suggested as author\r\nof the _De secretis mulierum_, but for no further reason.[2368]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Its citation of Albert, commentary, opening.]\r\n\r\nPerhaps the best reason for doubting the authenticity of _The Secrets\r\nof Women_ is that Albert seems to be cited in it, a point already\r\nnoted by Albert’s biographer, Peter of Prussia,[2369] towards the\r\nclose of the fifteenth century. It is, however, somewhat difficult\r\nto distinguish the text of the original treatise from that of a\r\ncommentary upon it which both accompanies and envelopes it in both\r\nthe manuscripts and printed editions. In this commentary Albert is\r\noften cited but apparently he also is cited in the text proper, from\r\nwhich, however, the commentary after a time ceases to be adequately\r\ndistinguished in those copies which I have examined.[2370] Possibly\r\nthis commentary is by Henry of Saxony or perhaps it is the commentary\r\nby Buridan mentioned in one of the manuscripts.[2371] It states that\r\nAlbert composed the treatise at the request of a priest (_sacerdos_),\r\nand the text itself opens with a salutation “To his dearest friend and\r\nassociate in Christ,” after which ensues a divergence, due no doubt\r\nto the carelessness of copyists, as to the name or initial letter of\r\nthe cleric in question, as to his place of residence, and as to his\r\necclesiastical rank or position.[2372] But he appears to have been a\r\nclerk from Erfurt who was studying at Paris. The text is in the form\r\nof a letter to this clerk and the author states that it is written “in\r\npart in physical and in part in medical style.” He asks the clerk not\r\nto reveal it to any depraved person and promises to send him further\r\nwritings, “when providence permitting I have toiled further in the\r\nart of medicine.”[2373] This fact that the _De secretis mulierum_ is\r\naddressed to a clerk who seems to be studying at Paris suggests that\r\nin the fourteenth century bibliography of writings by Dominicans the\r\ntitle, _Determinationes quarumdam questionum ad clerum Parisiensem_,\r\nas well as another title, _Secretum secretorum Alberti_, which are\r\nascribed to Albert, may refer to our treatise, although the exact\r\ntitle, _De secretis mulierum_, does not appear in the bibliography.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Nature of its contents.]\r\n\r\n_The Secrets of Women_ scarcely deserved to be placed on the Index\r\naside from the suggestiveness of its title and perhaps the fact that it\r\nhad become too popular. Meyer, while regarding it as spurious, rightly\r\nremarked that it shared the common medical knowledge of the time and\r\ndisplayed a strong astrological superstition, but was neither immoral\r\nnor indecent.[2374] As a matter of fact, its astrology is little\r\nmore extreme than what we have found in Albert’s undisputed works.\r\nThe article upon him in the _Histoire Littéraire de la France_[2375]\r\ndeclared that _The Secrets of Women_ was certainly not by him, but\r\nadded that he makes very similar statements in his commentary on the\r\nfourth book of the _Sentences_, where he justifies such knowledge on\r\nthe part of a priest as essential to his comprehension of what he\r\nis liable to be told in the confessional. This fits in nicely with\r\nthe statement that Albert composed the _De secretis mulierum_ at the\r\nrequest of a priest.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Medieval standards in such matters.]\r\n\r\n_The Secrets of Women_ may seem indecent judged by modern standards,\r\nbut so do many discussions of sexual matters by monastic recluses,\r\ntheologians, and church fathers of the distant past. Peter of\r\nPrussia, Albert’s fifteenth century biographer, although concerned\r\nto establish the saintly character of his hero, did not question the\r\nauthenticity of the _De secretis mulierum_ on grounds of indecency\r\nbut thought it “useful and necessary to know the facts of nature,\r\neven if indecent.”[2376] In the thirteenth century itself we find\r\na number of Latin works which are very similar to _The Secrets of\r\nWomen_. There is _The Secrets of Nature_ by Michael Scot and _The\r\nAdornment of Women_[2377] by Arnald of Villanova, a physician of the\r\nclosing thirteenth century who also wrote on Antichrist, advocated\r\nreligious reform, and gave moral and religious exhortation as well\r\nas medical care to his royal patients in Sicily and Aragon. This\r\n_De ornatu mulierum_ was described by the _Histoire Littéraire de\r\nla France_ as “one of Arnald’s most curious treatises, containing\r\nvery informing details concerning the arts by which medieval women\r\ncorrected the faults of nature or repaired the ravages of age. But we\r\nsay no more on this point. We would not venture the vaguest allusion\r\nto the contents of some paragraphs. They taught publicly in the middle\r\nages things which respectable persons do not know and do not wish to\r\nknow.”[2378] Those who are offended at the idea of the blessed Albert’s\r\ndiscussing such matters in the thirteenth century should read the\r\nhighly vivid, realistic, and matter-of-fact account of male sexual\r\npassion in the _Causae et curae_ of St. Hildegard,[2379] the mystic\r\nand ascetic, the abbess and prophetess, in the twelfth century, in\r\nwhich work it follows a long and circumstantial account of the process\r\nof conception and generation.[2380] Or they might note in a sixteenth\r\ncentury manuscript at Paris that an oration by John Antony Alatus,\r\ndoctor of physic, royal and apostolic knight, delivered when he was\r\nchosen orator to Pope Innocent, is immediately followed by a _Book of\r\nthe Secrets of Women_ by the same author.[2381] Of another thirteenth\r\ncentury work which attained extraordinary popularity in almost every\r\nEuropean language and which was most appropriately entitled, _De omni\r\nre scibili et quibusdam aliis_--“Of everything knowable and then some,”\r\nthe _Histoire Littéraire_ says,[2382] “The mysteries of generation\r\nengage its attention more than anything else; like _Timeo_ it is very\r\ndetailed upon this point and often borders upon obscenity.” A fourth\r\nwork, _The Secret of Philosophers_, written in French by someone who\r\nat least pretends to be a priest and doctor of theology, is also full\r\nof unprintable passages upon sex and generation, and yet shows also,\r\naccording to the _Histoire Littéraire_,[2383] the spirit of scientific\r\nphilosophy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Some superstitious recipes.]\r\n\r\nOur treatise contains some superstitious recipes akin to those of the\r\n_Liber aggregationis_ and _De mirabilibus mundi_. To prevent conception\r\nfor a year women are advised to drink salvia cooked with wine for three\r\ndays; or to eat a bee, “and she will never conceive.” If hairs of\r\nmenstruating women are buried in rich soil where ordure lies in winter\r\ntime, the sun’s heat will generate a long and strong serpent there the\r\nfollowing spring or summer. To tell if the child will be male or female\r\none should pour a drop of the mother’s milk or blood into pure water\r\nfrom a clear spring. If the drop goes to the bottom, the child will be\r\na boy; if it floats on the surface, a girl.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Astrology.]\r\n\r\nAstrology, however, is more prominent in this treatise than such\r\nmagical modes of divination. We are told that “all the virtues which\r\nthe soul comprehends in the body it draws from the supercelestial\r\nspheres and bodies.”[2384] From the farthest sphere come the powers\r\nof being and moving. From the sphere of the fixed stars the foetus\r\nreceives its individual personality. From the sphere of Saturn, the\r\nvirtue of discerning and reasoning; from that of Jupiter, magnanimity;\r\nfrom that of Mars, animosity and irascibility; from the sun, the power\r\nof learning and memorizing; and so on. We are also told how each\r\nplanet, starting with Saturn, rules for a month the formation of the\r\nvarious physical members of the child in the womb, and the fact that\r\nthe heart is formed during the fourth month under the rule of the\r\nsun is regarded as disproving Aristotle’s assertion that the heart\r\nis generated first of all the members. The influence of each planet\r\nat birth is also recorded, and we hear of “the influences of the\r\nplanets, whom the ancients called gods of nature, over man’s body and\r\nsoul.”[2385] Also that man’s intellectual power is not from matter\r\nbut from the sky. Saturn’s child is dark, hairy, well bearded, false,\r\nmalicious, wrathful, gloomy, wears unkempt clothing, and so forth. The\r\ninfluences of the twelve signs are also considered, and the _magnus\r\nannus_ with its repetition of history and Socrates reliving his life in\r\nthe same old Athens. The author also declares that divine sacrifice,\r\nimmolation of beasts, and the like cannot be removed from the action\r\nof the celestial bodies which mete out life and death, which perhaps\r\nsuggests that even religion and prayer are under the stars. Monstrous\r\nbirths, such as twins with separate heads and hands but one trunk and\r\npair of feet, are ascribed to some special constellation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Citations of Albert and Avicenna.]\r\n\r\nAlbert is cited, perhaps by the commentator, concerning twins of whom\r\none had such virtue in his right side that all bolts and locks on that\r\nside of him were opened, while the virtue of the other’s left side\r\nclosed all open doors. This was due not only to a special constellation\r\nbut to a special disposition of matter to receive its influence. Peter\r\nof Prussia (Cap. 12) cites the same passage from Albert’s _De motibus\r\nanimalium_. Other citations of Albert in the _De secretis mulierum_\r\nare one from a treatise on the sun and moon and the assertion that a\r\nchild was born with organs of either sex _ita quod potuit succumbere_.\r\nAvicenna is credited with having stated in a book on deluges that a\r\nflood might come and drown all living creatures, but that the virtue of\r\nthe sky would generate others.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[2335] I have examined at the British Museum four incunabula editions\r\ncontaining both treatises and numbered (at the time of my reading)\r\nas follows: IA.6829 (_Impressum Auguste per Johannem schauren feria\r\nsecunda post Bartholomei_, 1496); IA.46455; IA.55455 (_per me Wilhelmum\r\nde Mechlina Impressus in opulentissima civitate Londoniarum iuxta\r\npontem qui vulgariter dicitur Flete brigge_); 547 b. 1. (_Imprime pour\r\nThomas Laione Libraire Demourant a Rouen_). The text in these editions\r\nis nearly identical except for some divergencies in the one printed at\r\nRouen. The edition printed at London is perhaps the most accurate of\r\nthe four.\r\n\r\nI have not seen the following edition: _Liber aggregationum sive\r\nsecretorum de virtutibus herbarum, lapidum, et animalium_, Naples,\r\n1493-1494: nor an edition printed at Antwerp, 1485, in which the _Liber\r\naggregationis_ is bound with the _Quaestiones naturales_ of Adelard of\r\nBath. The _Liber aggregationis_ was published with the _De mirabilibus\r\nmundi_ at Frankfurt in 1614, and with the _De secretis mulierum_ at\r\nAmsterdam in 1643 and again in 1662, but I have not seen these three\r\neditions.\r\n\r\nI have seen an edition of sixteen leaves containing both _Liber\r\nsecretorum_ and _Liber de mirabilibus mundi_, Venetiis per Marchio\r\nSessa, 1509. Also an edition of both these treatises preceded by the\r\n_De secretis mulierum_ and followed by the _De secretis naturae_ of\r\nMichael Scot, Strasburg, 1607, per Lazarum Zetzerum; an edition of\r\nAmsterdam, 1740, containing the same four treatises; and an edition\r\nof Lyons, 1615, where the _Speculum astronomiae_ replaced the work by\r\nMichael Scot.\r\n\r\n[2336] For MSS of this treatise see Appendix I at the close of this\r\nchapter.\r\n\r\n[2337] S.

His existence has been\r\nquestioned, as Arabic works do not mention him, so that some regard\r\nhim as a Latin creation of the eleventh or twelfth century. His works\r\nwere printed at Venice in Latin in 1471, 1484, 1495, 1497, 1513, 1523,\r\n1568, and 1623. Some distinguish an earlier writer (c 777-857) of the\r\nsame name, known also as John of Damascus, whose _Aphorisms_ and some\r\nfragments are extant.\r\n\r\n[2359] The following passages, for instance, are identical in Digby 71,\r\nwhere the _Liber vaccae_ occurs at fols. 36-56, and in the printed text\r\nof the _De mirabilibus mundi_ (page references are to the Amsterdam\r\nedition of 1740).

On its cover is written in crowded medieval letters\r\nand with abbreviations, “De secretis mulierum alberti, Anathomia\r\nsecundum albertum, Expositio de lepra.” In the text itself this last\r\nis stated to be a gloss on Avicenna’s work on the cure of leprosy by\r\nmaster Albert “de sangaciis” or “de zanchariis” of Bologna, a doctor\r\nof the philosophical faculty. There seems, however, to be nothing to\r\nconnect his name with the two preceding treatises which respectively\r\nopen: “Incipit liber de secretis mulierum secundum Albertum magnum,”\r\nand “Incipit Anathomia tocius corporis secundum Albertum Magnum.” A\r\nNicolaus has signed his name as scribe or copyist of the _Anatomy_ and\r\n_De lepra_.\r\n\r\n[2367] V.

Some\r\nwere included in the early printed editions of their works, others are\r\nfound frequently in medieval Latin manuscripts. Some of them perhaps\r\nreally are by Rasis or have some connection with his works. In the next\r\nchapter we shall go on to books of experiments primarily of a chemical\r\nand magical character but some of which also are ascribed to Rasis or\r\nGalen.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Rasis on pains in the joints.]\r\n\r\nIt is essential to distinguish these various treatises from one another\r\nrather carefully, because a number of different writings are ascribed\r\nto Galen or Rasis under the common title of “Book of Experiments”\r\nor words to that effect.[2386] Thus Gilbert of England, a medical\r\nwriter of the first half of the thirteenth century, cites “the expert\r\nexperiments from Galen’s book of experiments” for the statement that\r\nammonia is a remedy for pains in the joints,[2387] while a fifteenth\r\ncentury manuscript at Berlin, containing various extracts from medical\r\nworks, cites “a certain experimenter of whom Rasis writes in the book\r\nof experiments, ‘He cured many afflictions by simple medicines.’”[2388]\r\nWe may first note that the title _Liber experimentorum_ or _Experimenta\r\nRasi_ is sometimes applied to what is probably a genuine work of\r\nRasis,[2389] namely, the treatise _On diseases of the Joints_ (_De\r\negritudinibus juncturarum_), which appears in both early printed\r\neditions of Rasis’ works.[2390] I think that this treatise sometimes is\r\nfound alone in the manuscripts,[2391] but more often it is followed by,\r\nor run together with, as if they formed a single work, another treatise\r\nor portion of a treatise which more properly deserves the title, _Book\r\nof Experiments_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Medical Experiments_ of Galen or Rasis.]\r\n\r\nThis is the book of medicines tested by experiment or of medical\r\nexperimentation[2392] or of experiments of the altar. It constantly\r\ntalks about experimenters and its contents are arranged as experiments.\r\nThe work opens with the statement that the fire which descended upon\r\nthe altar burnt the books of the king or kings, and with these numerous\r\nmedical works, including some which the author himself had begun\r\nto compose. This faintly suggests the fire of 192 A. D. mentioned\r\nby Galen which destroyed the shrine of Peace and the libraries on\r\nthe Palatine hill and the first two books, which had already been\r\npublished, of his own work on compound medicines. It might therefore\r\nseem that the present treatise is that of a forger trying to pass\r\nhimself off as Galen, and in the printed text of 1481 and many\r\nmanuscripts this opening statement is introduced by the words, “Said\r\nGalen.” In other manuscripts there is no such mention of Galen and\r\nthe treatise is ascribed to Rasis, like the work on diseases of the\r\njoints which so often precedes it. Between these two works there\r\noften intervenes a brief treatise or chapter on the medical treatment\r\nof children (_Practica puerorum_ or _parvorum_). Where the _Medical\r\nExperimentation_ comes to an end is not easy to determine. It might\r\nseem to be brought to a close by a sentence reading, “Said Galen”--or,\r\n“Says Rasis”--“Now we have said our say in this book which we call the\r\nbook of the experimental testing of medicines, which we have proved\r\nand have received from wiser men.” But after some further lines of\r\ntext, which scarcely seem the beginning of a new treatise, we meet\r\nin some editions or manuscripts with an “Explicit” or “Expliciunt\r\nexperimenta Galenis,” while in others the text proceeds without a\r\nbreak, although this sentence occurs, “Now moreover, of those medicines\r\nwe have mentioned in this treatise many tested by experience, but if we\r\nacquire yet others, we will write them at the end of this treatise.”\r\nThis would seem to indicate that the work is not yet finished. The\r\ntext then often continues, as we have said, discussing such matters\r\nas “How to take medicine without nausea; marvelous pills according\r\nto Rasis,” “Medicines which beautify the face,” “The composition of\r\nmany oils,” soporifics invented by Rasis to cure his own insomnia\r\nbrought on by too intense application to the medical art, and other\r\nremedies for varied complaints. In the 1497 edition of Rasis’ works,\r\nwhich does not contain the _Medical Experimentation_ proper, most\r\nof this supplementary material was combined in four chapters under\r\nthe separate title, _The Antidotarium of Rasis_,[2393] although that\r\ntitle apparently belongs to another work, while a passage on the stone\r\nwas also printed as a distinct _Tractatus Rasis de preservatione ab\r\negritudine lapidis_. But in the 1481 edition and such manuscripts as\r\nI have examined these chapters or paragraphs are not separated from\r\nthe _Medical Experimentation_, and the whole finally ends, “Expliciunt\r\nexperimenta rasis.” Possibly, therefore, everything that we have noted\r\nso far, beginning with the _Diseases of the Joints_, should be regarded\r\nas part of a composite treatise by Rasis, whose name occurs most often\r\nand prominently. If so, it is a very omnibus work and loosely hung\r\ntogether, nor when its parts are found together are they always in the\r\nsame sequence.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Value of such medical experiments.]\r\n\r\nIf we consider that portion which may be described as the _Medical\r\nExperimentation_ proper, we find that the Pseudo-Galen, or whoever\r\nhe is, goes on to say that he does not grieve so much over the\r\nloss of other books in the fire as he does concerning some medical\r\nexperiments which were there and which he had acquired from certain\r\ngood experimenters (_a quibusdam bonis viris experimentatoribus_). For\r\na single one of those experiments he may have had to give in exchange\r\nseveral good experiments of his own or perhaps a considerable sum of\r\nmoney. Sometimes a man may make a fortune and get a name for great\r\nlearning by knowing just one experiment which will cure a single\r\ndisease. Such men are very reluctant to impart their secret to others\r\nand sometimes it dies with them. Having thus secured the reader’s\r\nsympathy, attention, and interest, the author discloses the fact that,\r\ndespite his losses in the fire which descended upon the altar, he\r\nstill has some experiments left. He affirms that he has composed the\r\npresent work of medicines tested by his own experience or received from\r\ngood medical men, and that he does not fill up his book with familiar\r\nremedies like tyriac and opiates, but introduces medicines whose\r\nexistence is generally unknown.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Experimenters of many lands and cities.]\r\n\r\nOur author then proceeds to list one medical compound after another,\r\ngiving its ingredients and method of preparation, its effects on\r\nvarious parts and processes of the human body, and the diseases which\r\nit cures. Sometimes he explains the properties and operation of each\r\nconstituent. He usually gives the name and city of the experimenter\r\nfrom whom he received the prescription, but these proper names are\r\ndifficult to decipher, as they vary in the printed editions and\r\nmanuscripts[2394] and are often abbreviated and probably misspelled in\r\nboth. Thus “the experiments of Yrini pigami romani” are perhaps the\r\nsame as “the experiments of Urcanus Romanus” which Gilbert of England\r\ncites for some pills for sciatica.[2395] However, we seem to read of\r\nSacon or Socion, “the greatest of Greek medical men,” whose experiments\r\nour author gets from his disciples; of Gargeus or Agarges, who was the\r\nlord of all the wise men of his time; of Cateline, physician to King\r\nLithos; and of other physicians and medicines from Egypt, Macedonia,\r\nand Sicily. Often a number of experiments are taken from a single\r\nauthority; eleven from Gereon the Greek which our author has put to\r\nthe test and found to be truly marvelous; thirty by Athaharan, an\r\nexperimenter of the city of Abthor, some of which our author apologizes\r\nfor as well known; three compound and thirty simple medicines by\r\nAchaason, an experimenter of the city of Athens; twenty from Zeno of\r\nAthens, a great physician whom our author says he had never seen\r\nbecause not contemporary with him, but that his master had seen him\r\nand got good experiments from him and passed them on to our author who\r\nhas proved them oftentimes and found them true. Our author especially\r\nesteems the physicians of the altars, who are reputed superior to other\r\nmedical practitioners because they cure by means of the sacrificial\r\nmeats. Of a medicine which he received “from an Egyptian stranger,”\r\nhe exclaims that it has not its like and that this stranger had it\r\nfrom one of the physicians of the altars. These allusions suggest\r\nthat our author is a pagan, perhaps a Sabian like Thebit ben Corat,\r\nrather than a Mohammedan or Christian, but are perhaps a dodge of the\r\nforger like his opening allusion to the fire which descended on the\r\naltar--suggestive of fire-worship in Rasis’ own Persia.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Who was the Latin translator?]\r\n\r\nIn several manuscripts[2396] the treatise which we have just been\r\ndiscussing is ascribed to Galen rather than Rasis and is said to have\r\nbeen translated from Greek into Arabic by John or Johannitius, that\r\nis, by Honein ben Isʿhak or Hunain ibn Ishak, or Hunayn ibn Ishaq,\r\na Christian Arab who died in 873,[2397] and from Arabic into Latin\r\nby a Franchinus or Farachius or Ferranus or Ferrarus or Frarthacius.\r\nSteinschneider[2398] has explained the spellings, Franchinus,\r\nFarachius, Faragut, Fararius, and Ferrarius, as all applying to\r\nFaradj ben Salem, a Jew of Girgenti who was connected after 1279 with\r\nCharles of Anjou as a translator. This Jew, commonly called Faragius\r\nor Feragius in the Latin manuscripts, translated the _Continens_ of\r\nRasis[2399] and the medical treatise entitled _Tacuinum Dei_.[2400] But\r\ncan he be identified with the Ferrarius whom De Renzi[2401] classed\r\namong the medical writers of the school of Salerno and whose works are\r\nfound in a manuscript dated as early as the twelfth century?[2402] Also\r\nour treatise would seem to have been translated into Latin by the first\r\nhalf of the thirteenth century, since there are several manuscripts\r\nof it from that century, and since Gilbert of England cites either it\r\nor the Rasis on pains of the joints which regularly accompanies it.\r\nPerhaps Faragius made a re-translation, apparently not an uncommon\r\noccurrence in the medieval period. It is also worth recalling that\r\nPeter the Deacon listed among the works translated by Constantinus\r\nAfricanus a _De experimentis_. Can this have been the treatise ascribed\r\nto Galen or Rasis, and can Franchinus and the other names possibly\r\nbe corruptions of Africanus? But this is not all. Just as Galen and\r\nRasis have ascribed to them both medical works and works of alchemy,\r\nso one manuscript contains “Extracts from the treatise on the art of\r\nalchemy of brother Ferrarius,” who, like that other friar inclined to\r\nalchemy, Roger Bacon, “directs his letter to the Pope.”[2403] Nor do\r\nthese extracts seem to agree with the treatise in alchemy of Efferarius\r\nwhich has been printed,[2404] although he too is described as a monk\r\nwho addresses _apostolicum quendam_.[2405] Probably, however, the same\r\nalchemist is meant in both cases, but it also seems probable that\r\nin general there was more than one writer named Ferrarius. But from\r\nthe perplexing problems of who was the translator of the _Medical\r\nExperiments_ and of the identity or different personality indicated\r\nby Ferrarius and other similar names let us turn to another work\r\nattributed to Galen.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _The Secrets of Galen._]\r\n\r\nThe _Secrets of Galen_, or _The Book of Secrets_, is a treatise which\r\nseems to occur with fair frequency in the manuscripts[2406] and has\r\nalso appeared in print.[2407] It is perhaps most found with other\r\nworks of Galen, but also occurs in manuscripts containing experimental\r\nbooks, and in particular the _Medical Experiments_ of Galen or Rasis\r\njust considered, or in manuscripts with other works of Rasis. Gerard\r\nof Cremona is often mentioned in the manuscripts as the translator of\r\nthe work from Arabic into Latin, and such a translation is included in\r\nthe list of Gerard’s works drawn up by his associates soon after his\r\ndeath.[2408] At the close of the treatise occurs this statement: “Says\r\nHunayn, son of Isaac, ‘This is what we have found from the books (or,\r\nbook) of Galen for the use of the religious, and it is more glorious\r\nand blessed than his other books, and of aid, so that if another book\r\nwere lost, I could supply it from this one.’”[2409] This statement\r\nseems to indicate that this treatise, like the _Medical Experiments_,\r\nhad first been translated from the Greek to the Arabic by Honein ben\r\nIshak, or perhaps rather that Honein, who was a Christian Arab, has\r\nmade a compilation of extracts from the works of Galen for the use of\r\npersons of religion.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Addressed to “friend Monteus.”]\r\n\r\nThe opening words of the treatise are: “You have asked me, O friend\r\nMonteus, to write you a book on the cure of diseases in accordance\r\nwith experimental medicine and rational considerations from those\r\nnumerous cases which I have wisely tested of good men of religion in\r\nthe service of the king (or, in the observance of the Faith).”[2410]\r\nThat these remarks are not the preface of a translator but the words\r\nof the original author is indicated not only by the fact that in at\r\nleast one manuscript[2411] they are called, “The words of Galen,” but\r\nalso by the fact that, after the writer has made a few general medical\r\nobservations and allusions to his other writings on the elements, on\r\naid to the limbs, on disease and accidents, and on compound medicines,\r\nhe again addresses “brother Montheus” under the caption, “Words of\r\nGalen commending his book.”[2412] Montheus is now told that “this is\r\nthe book of great assistance which I composed in medicine, for I have\r\ntested all its contents many times in similar constitutions.” Galen,\r\nor whoever the writer may be, regards this treatise as supplementing\r\nand rectifying his work on compound medicines. In yet a third passage\r\n“friend Monteus” is told of an “alcohol” which keeps the eyes in good\r\ncondition which the writer has used.[2413]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Was he William of Saliceto’s “friend Montheus”?]\r\n\r\nBut here occurs a difficulty, for we find William of Saliceto, the\r\nnoted Italian surgeon of the thirteenth century, opening his work on\r\nsurgery with the words, “My intention is, friend Montheus, to publish\r\nfor you a work on manual operation in order to satisfy the petition of\r\nour associates.”[2414] It would therefore appear either that William’s\r\nwork on surgery is a mere translation of some earlier treatise, or\r\nthat William is also largely responsible for the so-called _Secrets of\r\nGalen_, and that he has throughout added new material and remarks of\r\nhis own to those of Honein and the genuine or pseudo-Galen. This would\r\nnot surprise us, for we have evidence that he was not the first to take\r\nsuch liberties with the work of Galen and Honein. Moses Maimonides,\r\nthe Jewish writer of the twelfth century, says in his Aphorisms that\r\nin the treatise of Hippocrates on diseases of women, upon which\r\nGalen commented and which Johannitius translated, he has found many\r\ninterpolations of a marvelous character “which some other person than\r\nJohannitius wrote and some other person than Galen expounded.”[2415]\r\nBut it would be difficult to explain why our treatise in the\r\nmanuscripts is quite generally said to have been translated into Latin\r\nby Gerard of Cremona, while William of Saliceto is never mentioned.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Patients and prescriptions.]\r\n\r\nThe _Secrets_ describes the writer’s treatment of such ills as stupor\r\nand chills, frenzy, headache, sore eyes, white growths in the eyes,\r\nearwigs, earache, bones stuck in the throat, nosebleed. His patients\r\nare likewise regularly mentioned and include old men of seventy and\r\nyoung men of twenty, one of the sons of the kings, a king’s daughter,\r\n“a man from the kings of Alexandria,” and another “man from kings,”\r\norators, and “a man from one of the villas of the Romans” who was\r\ntroubled with sciatica. He also describes pills for pains in the joints\r\nwhich he made for his young friend Glaucus,[2416] a philosopher of\r\nBeneventum.[2417] But he tells especially, as he had been asked to\r\ndo, of his prescriptions for monks and ascetics, both men and women,\r\nwho had ruined their health by their austerities.[2418] Be he Honein\r\nor Gerard of Cremona or William of Saliceto, the writer has no false\r\nmodesty and says of his “alcohol” for the eyes, for instance, “This is\r\nthe last word, and a great secret.” His recipes, however, are the usual\r\nsort of compounds and are limited to medicinal purposes, so that there\r\nis no reason for us to dwell upon them further.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Liber Medicinales de Secretis Galieni._]\r\n\r\nFrom its title one might think that a _Medicinal Book of the Secrets\r\nof Galen_ in an Oxford manuscript[2419] would turn out to be the\r\nsame treatise as the foregoing, but upon examination it is found to\r\nconsist chiefly of the medicinal virtues of animals and parts of\r\nanimals, beginning with man. The names of the animals are given in\r\na foreign language, which is probably meant to be Arabic, and the\r\ntext is accompanied by a series of spirited little miniatures of the\r\nanimals in the margin, ending with the transmarine eagle. The work\r\nrather resembles that of Sextus Placitus on medicine from animals\r\nwhich precedes it in this manuscript and which we have discussed in an\r\nearlier chapter.[2420] The closing chapters of our text deal with the\r\nfour humors. The superstitious and fantastic uses to which the parts\r\nof animals are put is indicated by the opening words of the treatise,\r\n“Bind on the tooth of a dead man.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Rasis _On sixty animals_.]\r\n\r\nA very similar work on sixty animals is ascribed to Rasis in the 1497\r\nedition of his works, and Albertus Magnus cites “the book of sixty\r\nanimals” to the effect that the flesh of the dog is hot and dry.[2421]\r\nIn reality in the treatise as it has reached us, only fifty-six\r\nanimals are discussed, the first being the lion, and the fifty-fifth\r\nand fifty-sixth, man and woman.[2422] Most of the animals treated are\r\nequally familiar, but some names have been left in Arabic. The work\r\ndoes not describe the animals and their habits, still less draw moral\r\nlessons or spiritual illustrations from them, but limits itself to\r\ntheir medicinal properties, or in a few cases, such as ants or mad\r\ndogs, to remedies against their bites. Much of the contents is of the\r\nsame sort as Pliny’s discussion of the medical virtues of parts of\r\nanimals, but the few authorities cited are Arabic or Greek,--Aristotle,\r\nDioscorides and Galen. The work is very superstitious. With the right\r\neye of a hedge-hog and other ingredients an eyewash is made which is\r\nsupposed to enable one to see in the dark, while if the left eye of the\r\nsame animal is fried in oil and a little of it inserted in a person’s\r\near on the point of a stylus, he is supposed to drop off to sleep at\r\nonce.[2423] Eating a frog is recommended as a restraint upon sexual\r\npassion and upon conception.[2424] It is said that everyone will be\r\nterrified who enters a house that has been sprinkled with the water in\r\nwhich the animal called _iaroboath_ has been drowned.[2425] If a man’s\r\ntooth and a hoopoe’s wing are suspended over a sleeper, he will not\r\nawake until they are removed.[2426] To cure tertian or quartan fever\r\none places on the back of one’s neck with the left hand a powder made\r\nof a spider who has been captured while in the act of catching flies,\r\npulverized, and stored in linen.[2427]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Eberus _On the virtues of animals_.]\r\n\r\nVery similar to, indeed perhaps in large measure identical with one\r\nor the other of the two foregoing treatises or with the _De medicina\r\nex animalibus_ of Sextus Placitus, judging from the description of\r\nit given by Valentinelli, is a work on the virtues of about seventy\r\nanimals in a manuscript of the fifteenth century at Venice.[2428] Like\r\nthe work of Sextus Placitus it opens with “the little beast which some\r\ncall the _taxo_.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Galen and Honein _On Plants_.]\r\n\r\nTo Galen was ascribed not only the work on the occult medicinal virtues\r\nof animals already noted, but also a like treatise on plants.[2429]\r\nIt was translated from the Arabic into Latin by _Grumerus Index de\r\nPlacentia_ (Grumerus, a judge of Piacenza) and Master Abraham the\r\nphysician, and is in the form of a Gloss or Commentary by Honein\r\nben Ishak or Johannitius, whom we again encounter as the translator\r\nor adapter of Galen from the Greek. Honein states that Galen’s wish\r\nin this work was to set down some medicines of marvelous properties\r\nwhich he had collected in the course of his lifetime, and which Honein\r\ntoo has often put to the test, “and experience never fails.” These\r\nmedicines are not commonly known, because Galen wished them divulged\r\nonly to men of wisdom and discretion. Others, however, before Honein\r\nhave translated the treatise from Greek into Arabic, and a preceding\r\nglossator has dealt with it in a way of which Honein does not approve\r\nand which he intends to rectify, including only what is true and what\r\nhe has himself tested. Forty-six specimens are then treated, of which a\r\nfew are stones or parts of animals rather than plants.[2430] Honein’s\r\ngloss is mainly devoted to explaining what plant or tree Galen had in\r\nmind in each case, or, where Galen does not give an exact name, to\r\nstating its Arabic equivalent. In a few cases the opinion of Abraham\r\nthe Jew is briefly added.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Secrets_ or _Aphorisms_ of Rasis.]\r\n\r\nTo Rasis is attributed not only a work on animals much like that\r\nascribed to Galen; there also is a _Book of Secrets in Medicine_\r\nprinted under his name.[2431] But to avoid confusion with the two books\r\nof secrets ascribed to Galen, we shall henceforth speak of Rasis’\r\ntreatise by its alternative title of _Aphorisms_. The following is a\r\nliteral translation of its preface, interesting for its attitude to\r\nscience and books, and both original and at the same time occasionally\r\na bit incoherent and abrupt or strange and mystical in tone. Perhaps\r\nthese characteristics are to be partly accounted for by awkwardness of\r\nthe Latin translator in grappling with the Arabic, or, if we assume\r\nthat the work is by Rasis, to the coming on of old age, or perhaps\r\nthey are merely the mystic and boastful style characteristic of\r\npseudo-literature.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A literal translation of its preface.]\r\n\r\n“I have collected and classified diseases, and I have shown cures and\r\nthe natures of cures from the canons of the ancients and from treatises\r\nand chapters to the best of my ability; and I beseech God to supply me\r\nwith the additional strength and power to complete this book and make\r\nit a useful one. Already we have completed a compilation of things\r\ntested by experience in the arts, namely, philosophy and physics, two\r\nsubjects in which words and facts are infinite. And men can never make\r\nan end of those subjects (_Nec etiam homines in eis complementum habere\r\npossunt_.) But our intention in this book is to show things useful to\r\nhumanity. And in this we differ from the ancients who hid things that\r\nwere essential to know and deprived of light the path of science and\r\nvirtue. And witness to this point is our big book of divine science,\r\nwhich is the Book of Spirituals, and our book Of the Spirit. And our\r\ndiscussion in the Book of Diets, namely, how indulgence may be removed\r\nfrom these for all time. And I have condensed the language so that one\r\ncan get to the point more easily. And I expect retribution from God who\r\nwill furnish me aid. For without Him nothing has effect.”\r\n\r\n“Says Abu Bekr: the wise man is not occult and in every age, despite\r\nfrauds and concealments of the paths of science and of the ancient\r\narts, compilers have collected their doctrines and discovered their\r\nways whether hidden or manifest. And this book of ours is first and\r\nis secret and is handy. And show it not to undeserving persons. In it\r\nis contained reason, it adds something to the ancients, and as long\r\nas there shall be days and years I shall live and gain through this\r\nbook of mine, and I have no doubt that this book of mine is something\r\nsecret. For it has been my plan to tell some secrets in it, both in\r\nprognostics of the future and in confidential information and some of\r\nmy own cases. Said confidences I acquired and collected from the books\r\nof sages who had not perfectly revealed them. And from what I have\r\nexperienced myself and acquired by my reason. And witness thereof is\r\nmy rational language, and I have spoken in collections of medicines\r\nand foods, and I want to strike a golden mean between these and free\r\nmy words entirely from the accidental. And know that this is the pith\r\nof all utility and the pearl of clarity which brings light out of\r\ndarkness. Which book the ancients would have praised had they lived\r\ntill now, and I have divided it into six chapters without superfluity;\r\nwith comprehensiveness and brevity I now begin to speak with my\r\nexcessive virtue and occult science.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Contents of its six chapters.]\r\n\r\nThe first chapter on prognostics deals with the weather as a sign or\r\ncause of disease and also with bodily symptoms. The next two chapters\r\non experiments, confidences, and Rasis’ own cases, contain some close\r\nresemblances to two treatises already described in this chapter,\r\nlisting marvelous oils, plasters, confections, and suffumigations like\r\nthe latter part of the _Experimental Medicines_ of Galen or Rasis,\r\nmaking the same citations of Haly, and giving Rasis’s prescription for\r\nhis own insomnia; and also the alcohol (here spelt _alcofol_) for white\r\ngrowths of the eyes of the _Secrets of Galen_, which is again called\r\n“the last word” (_Scias quod hoc est ultimum_). The fourth chapter\r\nspeaks of the great force of occult virtues in natural substances, the\r\ndifficulty of measuring and comprehending such occult virtue, and the\r\nconsequent need of moderation and caution in the use of medicines and\r\nthe danger of rash experiment. The author’s advice that “of medicines\r\neveryone should take less” was certainly sound amid the extravagances\r\nof ancient and medieval pharmacy. He gives an interesting list of drugs\r\nwhich may safely be employed.[2432] The fifth chapter, after a brief\r\nintroduction by Rasis, consists of the _Secrets_ or _Prognosticon_ of\r\nHippocrates, which we have already met following or in the midst of the\r\n_Experimental Medicines_ of Galen. The sixth chapter is a collection\r\nof miscellaneous aphorisms such as that in the practice of medicine\r\n“Laymen and those would judge by their intuition and young men who\r\nhave not had practical experience are no better than murderers,”[2433]\r\nand that “women who are accustomed to sleep a great deal on the right\r\nside will hardly bear a female child.” In both the sixth and second\r\nchapters the need of a doctor’s knowing astronomy and the importance of\r\nobserving the planets and the moon are touched on. Appeals for divine\r\naid and the rendition of thanks to God occur occasionally throughout\r\nthe treatise.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Experimentator._]\r\n\r\nWithington states in his _Medical History_ that Rasis was sometimes\r\ncalled _Experimentator_. Now among the many medieval “experimental\r\nbooks” was one which is cited simply as _Experimentator_ by two\r\nthirteenth century writers, Petrus Hispanus, afterwards Pope John\r\nXXI, in his _Thesaurus Pauperum_,[2434] a medical compendium of great\r\npopularity, and Thomas of Cantimpré in his encyclopedia entitled _De\r\nnatura rerum_.[2435] In his preface Thomas describes _Experimentator_\r\nas “a book without name of the author, which I have heard was compiled\r\nin modern times.”[2436] No manuscript of a work so entitled seems to be\r\nextant. The citations of Thomas and Peter from the work deal largely\r\nwith animals, their habits and semi-human characteristics, and the\r\nvirtues medicinal and otherwise of various parts of their carcasses.\r\n_Experimentator’s_ prescriptions included eating the heart of a wolf\r\nand the gall of a bear, taking a powder compounded of the burnt hoof\r\nof an ass, the ashes of a weasel, and swallows burnt alive, touching\r\nan aching tooth with that of a dead man, and even more disgusting\r\nremedies. Some of these suggest the _Sixty Animals_ of Rasis, but it\r\nwill be remembered that that treatise did not touch upon the habits\r\nof the animals but only their medicinal uses. Moreover, Peter of\r\nSpain cites herbs and other non-animal remedies from _Experimentator_\r\nfor paralysis of the tongue, toothache, and constipation, while\r\nThomas of Cantimpré repeats “the properties of air according to\r\n_Experimentator_.” Thomas does well to speak of the book as _compiled_\r\nin modern times, for many of its statements have a familiar sound\r\nand suggest use of such authors as Pliny and Marcellus Empiricus.\r\nFor instance, Thomas cites _Experimentator_ for the account found\r\nin Pliny’s _Natural History_--and described by Pliny himself as an\r\n“experiment”--of marking a dolphin’s tail in order to learn its age, if\r\nit should chance to be caught again. On the whole, if neither Peter nor\r\nThomas knew who wrote the _Experimentator_, it is probably idle for us\r\nto make surmises, unless possibly it may have been by Thomas himself,\r\nwhose authorship even of the _De natura rerum_ is seldom recognized\r\neither in the manuscript catalogues or in the manuscripts themselves.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Experiments_ of Nicholas of Poland and Montpellier.]\r\n\r\nOf medieval collections of experiments which are medicinal in character\r\nwe may further include some which do not fall under the head of\r\npseudo-literature but are ascribed to a writer of the thirteenth or\r\nearly fourteenth century.[2437] Such are “The Experiments of Brother\r\nNicholas, a physician of Poland, who was at Montpellier thirty (or,\r\ntwenty) years and who had such efficiency (or, was a man of so great\r\nexperience) that neither before him is there believed to have been his\r\nlike, nor is it hoped for the future, as is patent in his marvelous\r\nworks in divers provinces and regions in easily expediting great\r\nand sudden cures.”[2438] Nicholas is here spoken of as “brother”\r\nbecause he was a Dominican friar. In one manuscript this Nicholas of\r\nMontpellier is further called “de Bodlys.” Serpents are used a great\r\ndeal in his experiments. Thus to break the stone in the reins or\r\nbladder he recommends that the patient drink a little “snake-dust”\r\n(_pulverem serpentis_)[2439] in wine early in the morning and late at\r\nnight. Or a pulverized toad or scorpion would be even more efficacious.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: His _Antipocras_.]\r\n\r\nIn one manuscript the _Experiments_ of Nicholas are immediately\r\nfollowed by his _Antipocras_ or _Book of Empirical Remedies_.[2440]\r\nThis work, in form a poem with a prose prologue, in content is in part\r\nan invective against the physicians of the Hippocratic school, who,\r\nwhether on rational grounds or from motives of professional jealousy,\r\nhave questioned the marvelous cures which Nicholas has wrought by\r\nunusual pills or drugs, or by external applications in rings and\r\nbrooches. In part it is a listing of these empirical methods, ligatures\r\nand suspensions, employment of occult virtues and amulets, by means of\r\nwhich Nicholas asserts that he has wrought so many marvelous cures,\r\nand which he declares are based on repeated experiment and solid\r\nexperience, whether they seem reasonable _a priori_ or not. He assails\r\nthe authority of Galen who said, “Physician, how can you cure, if you\r\nare ignorant of the cause?” He makes much of the doctrine of occult\r\nvirtues in many things, and “more in despised than in precious and\r\nfamous things.” As authorities in his support he cites Tobias, Ptolemy,\r\nHermes and “master Albert.” The magnet, as usual, is brought forward as\r\na proof of the existence of occult virtue.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Other works of Nicholas.]\r\n\r\nA treatise entitled, _Fates of the Stars_, is ascribed to a Nicholas of\r\nPoland in a manuscript at Munich, but if the date given, 1477 A. D., be\r\nthat of composing the treatise, the author is evidently too late to be\r\nour Nicholas.[2441] Of chemical experiments attributed to some Nicholas\r\nwe shall speak in the following chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[2386] For instance, the following 14th century MSS at Munich and Paris\r\ncontain _Experimenta_ ascribed to Rasis along with his _Divisiones_,\r\n_Antidotarium_, _Synonyms_, etc. CLM 13045, fol. 143; 13114, fol.\r\n247; BN 6902, 6903, 6904, 6906. It is necessary to examine the MSS to\r\ntell what the work or works thus designated may be, which I have been\r\nunable to do in the case of the MSS at Munich. It is also impossible\r\nto tell what _Experimenta_ of Rasis are meant in numbers 1227 and 1229\r\n(James) of the medieval catalogue of St. Augustine’s, Canterbury.\r\nOther extant MSS which cannot be identified from the notices of them\r\nin the catalogues are: Wolfenbüttel 479, 15th century, fols. 304-16,\r\nExperimenta Rasis, and 3175, 15th century, fols. 181v-6v, Experimenta\r\nmagis famosa et magis usualia ex libro experimentorum generali Rasis;\r\nVienna 2364, 14th century, fols. 153-73, Rhasis, Experimenta, and 2387,\r\n14th century, fols. 137-9, quaedam experimenta translata a “Guirardo.”\r\n\r\n[2387] Gilbertus Anglicus, _Compendium medicinae_, Lyons, 1510, fol.\r\n328v.\r\n\r\n[2388] Berlin 908, fol. 62.\r\n\r\n[2389] In the Arabic list of 232 titles ascribed to Rasis published by\r\nRanking (1913), numbers 17 and 18 are works on gout.\r\n\r\n[2390] Milan, 1481; and Bergamo, 1497.\r\n\r\n[2391] Apparently so in CLM 12, 15th century, fols. 277-84; which,\r\nhowever, I have not personally examined. The opening words of the _De\r\negritudinibus iuncturarum_ are, “Dicit Rasis volo in hoc capitulo\r\ndicere medicinas que sunt necessarie in doloribus iuncturarum.”\r\n\r\n[2392] See Appendix I for a list of the MSS of it.\r\n\r\n[2393] At fols. 98v-101v: cap. 1, “De aptitudine medicinarum ut sine\r\nhorribilitate possint sumi secundum rasim pillule mirobalanorum”; cap.\r\n2, “De medicinis que ornant faciem”; cap. 3, “Compositio multorum\r\noleorum”; cap. 4, containing remedies for various complaints, opens,\r\n“Summa istius capituli. Post electionem specierum instrumentorum” and\r\nends, “cum sirupo cit(r?)oniorum.” But in both the edition of 1481 and\r\nSt. John’s 85, fol. 176v, recipes to induce sleep are headed “Chapter\r\nThree.”\r\n\r\n[2394] For instance, the first compound is described in the 1481\r\nedition of Rasis as “ab afloīa experimentatore qui erat de civitate\r\nteriste,” while in Arundel 115 we read “ab astarō experimentatore qui\r\nerat de civitate tetith.”\r\n\r\n[2395] _Compendium medicinae_ (1510), fol. 328v.\r\n\r\n[2396] See Appendix I. Unfortunately I have not seen these particular\r\nMSS.\r\n\r\n[2397] E. G. Browne (1921), pp. 24-26, repeats some good stories\r\nconcerning Hunayn ibn Ishaq from al-Quifti and the Fihrist, and says\r\n(p. 26) “Generally, as we learn from the Fihrist, Hunayn translated the\r\nGreek into Syriac, while (his pupil) Hubaysh translated from Syriac\r\ninto Arabic, the Arabic version being then revised by Hunayn, who,\r\nhowever, sometimes translated directly from Greek into Arabic. All\r\nthree languages were known to most of these translators, and it is\r\nprobable, as Leclerc suggests, that whether the translation was made\r\ninto Syriac or Arabic depended on whether it was primarily designed for\r\nChristian or Muslim readers.”\r\n\r\nConcerning Honein see further Suter (1900), pp. 21-23.\r\n\r\n[2398] Steinschneider (1905), p. 14. In Virchow’s _Archiv_, XXXIX\r\n(1868) 317-23, he holds that a prologue by Farachius opening, “Friend,\r\nmay God grant you noble morals,” should precede the _Incipit_, “Said\r\nGalen, ‘The fire that descended,’” but in the next chapter we shall\r\nfind reason for believing that this prologue belongs rather with the\r\n_Liber Vaccae_, also ascribed to Galen and Honein.\r\n\r\n[2399] In two Vatican MSS of the 14th century, Urbin. Lat. 237 and 239,\r\nare respectively books i-xi and xiv-xxv of the _Elhâwi_ (_El-hauy_)\r\nof Rasis, which Feragius or Faragut is said to have translated from\r\nArabic into Latin at the mandate of King Charles at Naples. “Explicit\r\ntranslatio ... facta de mandato excellentissimi regis Karoli ...\r\nper manus magistri feragii Iudei filii magistri Dalem de aggregendo\r\n(Salez de Agrigento) ... die lune xiii februarii septimae indictionis\r\napud Neapolim.” The variant readings in parentheses are from two 15th\r\ncentury volumes of 537 and 471 double columned leaves respectively\r\nwhich form MS 1091 in the library of the University of Bologna.\r\n\r\n[2400] Ed. J. Schott, Strasburg, 1532. The work divides into two\r\nparts, _Tacuinum morborum_ and _Tacuinum sanitatis_. MSS are numerous\r\nbut often anonymous: Vienna 2322, 13th century, 26 fols.; Bologna\r\nUniversity Library 389, 14th century, 43 fols.; etc. In two Oxford MSS\r\nof the 14th century, Magdalen 102 and Corpus Christi 65, and in Vendôme\r\n233, 15th century, fol. 81, the work is said to have been translated\r\nfrom Arabic into Latin “by the hands of master Faragius for King\r\nCharles.” But in S. Marco XIV, 50, 14th century, it is said to have\r\nbeen translated under Manfred (1258-1266), “Liber Tacuini translatus\r\nde arabico in latinum in curia illustrissimi regis Manfredi scientiae\r\namatoris.” The Arabic original, Taqwímu’s-Sihha, was written by Ibn\r\nButlán who died about 1063 A. D.\r\n\r\n[2401] _Collectio Salernitana_, 1852-1859, I, 363, 369.\r\n\r\n[2402] Library of the Dukes of Burgundy (Brussels) 4567, 12th century,\r\nFerrarii, Tractatus de medicina, opening, “In tractatu nostro primo\r\nvideam.” But perhaps the MS is dated too early in the catalogue of\r\n1842. In Digby 197, 13th century, fols. 57-69, opening “Febris ut\r\ntestatur Jo (annitius) est calor innaturalis,” and closing, “in qua\r\nbullierint ar. dragna (?) liquir, et succus eius. Expliciunt febres M.\r\nFerrarii feliciter,” may be another translation from Honein. Coxe says\r\nthat there is another copy of it among the MSS of All Souls College.\r\n\r\n[2403] Digby 164, early 15th century, fol. 17, “Extracta de tractatu\r\nfratris Ferrarii super arte alkymie. Dirigit epistolam suam Papae et\r\nprimo ponit artis impedimenta.” The same MS, as a matter of fact,\r\ncontains (fols. 8-12v) Bacon’s letter on the secret works of art and\r\nnature and the nullity of magic.\r\n\r\n[2404] _Verae alchimiae doctrina_, Basel, 1561, pp. 232-7; also in\r\nZetzner, _Theatrum chemicum_, III (1613), 128-37.\r\n\r\n[2405] Steinschneider (1905), p. 14.\r\n\r\n[2406] They will be found listed in Appendix II to this chapter.\r\n\r\n[2407] In the edition of Galen’s works of Venice, 1609, VIII, _Spurii\r\nlibri_, fols. 101v-108v.\r\n\r\n[2408] Boncompagni (1851), pp. 3-4, following Cod.

It also is found in old editions of Galen,\r\nsuch as that of Venice, 1609, VIII, Spurii libri, fols. 108v-113v; and\r\nthat of Renatus Charterius, Paris, 1679, X, 561-70.\r\n\r\nIt occurs frequently in the MSS. In the following list I have\r\nendeavored to indicate the other treatises accompanying it, since they\r\nare perhaps all sections of one work. I note first those MSS which I\r\nhave personally examined.\r\n\r\n St. John’s College 85, late 13th century, fol. 157v-,\r\n   “Incipiunt experimenta rasi. Dicit rasis volo in hoc\r\n   capitulo dicere medicinas que sunt necessarie in doloribus\r\n   iuncturarum scilicet medicinas laxativas” ... (the Incipit\r\n   of the De egritudinibus iuncturarum): fol. 167r-, “De\r\n   experimentis altaris. Dixit G. quod ignis qui descendit\r\n   ...” (the Incipit of the De medicinis experimentatis):\r\n   fol. 172v-, “De aptatione medicine ut sine horribilitate\r\n   possit sumi secundum Rasim pillule mirabiles”: fol.\r\n   178v, “Expliciunt experimenta rasis. amen dicant omnia.”\r\n   Steinschneider (1905), p. 12, was in error in describing\r\n   the “experiments” of Rasis in this MS as alchemistic;\r\n   nor do I understand why he said (1906), p. 47, “Ein\r\n   medizinisches liber Experimentorum von Razi ist sonst kaum\r\n   bekannt; wenn St. Johns Coll. 85 ein solcher enthält, so\r\n   ist wohl der Titel neu,” especially since he himself some\r\n   pages later (1906), p. 85, associates with the name of\r\n   Rasis a lib. Experimentorum in Wolfenbüttel 479, fols.\r\n   304-16.\r\n\r\n Arundel 115, 1327 A.

The table of contents indicates that the\r\n   MS once contained other medical treatises including\r\n   _Experimenta_ of “Gilbert, chancellor of Montpellier.”\r\n\r\n Balliol College 231, early 14th century, a ponderous folio\r\n   volume of Galen’s works in Latin translation; of 26 items\r\n   our treatise is #6 at fols. 39v-45r.\r\n\r\n Peterhouse 33, 13-14th century Italian hand, fols. 186-92,\r\n   Liber g. de Secretis Secretorum, “Rogasti me amice\r\n   montane.”\r\n\r\n Chartres 284, 13th century, Galeni opuscula, fols. 251v-258,\r\n   Secreta Galieni a magistro Girardo Cremonensi translata de\r\n   arabico in latinum.

Manuscripts\r\n of the _Liber Vaccae_--Appendix II. Manuscripts of the\r\n _Secretum Philosophorum_.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The _Liber Vaccae_.]\r\n\r\nOf the books of experiments of a chemical or magical character which\r\nwe have to consider in this chapter the earliest, as far as our\r\navailable information goes, is the _Liber Vaccae_, with which the\r\nname of Galen is associated and which is primarily a collection of\r\nmagical and necromantic experiments. The original author, however,\r\nwas the philosopher Plato whose work, according to a long, rambling,\r\nand confused prefatory statement, Galen had revised and abbreviated.\r\nSteinschneider held that our treatise was cited under the title _Liber\r\nde prophetiis_ by Pedro Alfonso in the _Disciplina clericalis_ at the\r\nclose of the eleventh century,[2442] but perhaps Pedro knew it in\r\nArabic or Hebrew[2443] rather than Latin translation. The manuscripts\r\nof the Latin translation, however, go back to the thirteenth, if not\r\nto the twelfth century,[2444] while for most of the other treatises to\r\nbe considered in this chapter the oldest extant manuscripts seem to\r\nbe of the fourteenth century. Moreover, William of Auvergne refers to\r\nour treatise in his work written in the first half of the thirteenth\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Its other titles.]\r\n\r\nThe work has many other alternative titles besides _Liber Vaccae_,\r\nwhich seems to be suggested by its first experiment which is concerned\r\nwith a cow, and _Liber de prophetiis_, which I do not remember to have\r\nseen in any Latin manuscript. Another common title is _Liber Anguemis_\r\nor _Anequems_ or _Anegnems_ or _Anagnenis_,[2445] although the preface\r\nexplains that the treatise was not called the _Liber Anguemis_ in\r\nthe first place. The manuscripts also call it _The Book of Active\r\nInstitutes_ and _The Book of Aggregations of Divers Philosophers_.\r\nWilliam of Auvergne spoke with disapproval of our treatise as a book\r\nof mixtures employed in magic, which was ascribed to Plato and called\r\n_Liber Neumich_ or _Nevemich_, or the _Laws_ of Plato. “And,” adds\r\nWilliam sarcastically, “it is called the _Laws_ of Plato because it\r\nis contrary to the laws of nature.”[2446] Steinschneider has pointed\r\nout that in Arabic _Nawamis_ means “laws” and that both _Neumich_ and\r\n_Anguemis_ are probably Latin corruptions of the Arabic word. And\r\nof course _Laws_ and _Institutes_ are practically the same thing.\r\nPico della Mirandola, writing against astrology at the close of the\r\nfifteenth century, refers to our treatise by the two titles _De vacca_\r\nand _Institutes_, warning his readers that astrologers palm off their\r\nvolumes as the writings of great authorities like Aristotle, “just\r\nas magicians carry about the books of Plato _De vacca_ and what they\r\ncall the _Books of Institutes_, stuffed with execrable dreams and\r\nfigments.”[2447]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Its two prologues.]\r\n\r\nHonein ben Ishak again appears in connection with a supposititious\r\nwork of Galen. The long and repetitious prefatory statement, to which\r\nwe have already alluded, is professedly by him, and we are told what\r\nHonein said and what Galen said and what Honein says Galen said\r\nin great profusion. The Latin translator, however, not to mention\r\nsubsequent copyists, has perhaps taken liberties with the wording of\r\nthis preface and corrupted an original Arabic clarity. Who the Latin\r\ntranslator is we are not told, but in some manuscripts the prefatory\r\nstatement to which we have thus far alluded is proceeded by an even\r\nlonger prologue which opens with the pious wish, “May God confer\r\nnoble morals upon you.” This is probably the same as a prologue by\r\n“Farachius” opening, “Friend, may God grant you noble morals,” which\r\nSteinschneider held belonged with the _Medical experiments_ of Galen or\r\nRasis.[2448] But our prologue seems to contain a direct allusion to the\r\nfollowing _Liber vaccae_[2449] as well as to be generally appropriate\r\nto it. The name of the writer of this first prologue is not given in\r\nthe manuscripts I have seen, but he refers to his books concerning\r\nanimals and poisons and simple medicines, which last is also called\r\nthe _Book of Sustenance_ (_liber sustentationis_). He appears to have\r\nbeen criticized for his propensity toward marvels and occult virtues\r\nand his inconsistency in at the same time censuring vulgar suspensions,\r\nincantations, and cures. His defense of occult properties is the usual\r\none that even if reason cannot account for them, they are supported\r\nboth by the testimony of the ancients and by experience. As usual the\r\nproperty of the magnet is adduced; the Pseudo-Aristotle is cited “in\r\nhis books on stones,” and the genuine Aristotle in the _History of\r\nAnimals_ concerning the narce’s power of stupefying. The remainder of\r\nthe prologue consists chiefly of a series of citations from various\r\nauthors which are largely duplicated in the _De mirabilibus mundi_\r\nascribed to Albertus Magnus. This first prologue cannot be by Honein,\r\nsince it cites not only Costa ben Luca but _filius messie_, that is,\r\nYuhanna ibn Masawaih who died at Cairo in 1015, or some Latin writer of\r\nthe eleventh or twelfth century who pretended to translate his works\r\nfrom the Arabic. Presumably therefore it is by the Latin translator of\r\nthe _Liber vaccae_. This could not be Faradj ben Salem under Charles of\r\nAnjou if the translation was known to William of Auvergne early in the\r\nthirteenth century.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Experiments in magic generation and rainmaking.]\r\n\r\nThe experiments of the _Liber vaccae_ are hardly such as can be\r\ndescribed in detail in English translation. Some of them are\r\nelaborate experiments in unseemly generation and obstetrics, having\r\nfor their object “to make a rational animal” from a cow or ape or\r\nother beast,[2450] or “to make bees.”[2451] By a similar procedure a\r\nliniment is obtained which has such virtue that if one is anointed\r\nwith it, one feels no pain from blows, while it blunts the edge of\r\na sword with which one is struck. Or by suffumigations with it rain\r\nmay be produced.[2452] A less unmentionable method of rain-making is\r\nthat which is “famous among the wise” and which, the author says, some\r\nemploy in his own time. First a black crow without a speck upon it is\r\nto be “submerged in water until it dies.” Then a very black dog is to\r\nbe imprisoned in a dark house and given the crow to eat and the water\r\nin which it was drowned to drink on the third day. By the eleventh\r\nday, we are assured, only the whites of his eyes will show and he will\r\nbe unable to bark. Then one takes a small tree called _mephus_ with\r\nsmall leaves like rue and a flower like the bean, and gives the dog\r\nabout an ounce of its juice, which will cause him to recover his voice\r\nand bark mightily. He should then be bound “hand and foot” (_manus et\r\npedes_) and boiled in a big pot. The broth thus obtained is to be used\r\nto bring rain.[2453] Other procedures are described to stop a rainy\r\nspell and restore fine weather.[2454]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: More magic with animals]\r\n\r\nIn order to see spirits a white cock with a round crest which is\r\nconcave in the middle is put in a place where neither the bark of a dog\r\nnor the voice of a crow is heard, whereby this experiment is sharply\r\ndistinguished from the dog-and-crow procedure. For three successive\r\ndays the cock is to be fed on the eyes of three fish of the species\r\nknown as _alliataiu_, and the eyes must have been removed while the\r\nfish were living. On the third day the cock will swell up and become\r\naggressive and his crest will grow inflamed. After three hours he is to\r\nbe decapitated and fed to a wild cat, which is then to be beheaded in\r\nits turn. Its blood and gall are to be dried and from them a concoction\r\nis to be prepared which will enable one to see spirits.[2455] A frog\r\nfigures as an ingredient in a mixture which, if one merely writes with\r\nit on parchment and throws the same into a den of snakes or vipers,\r\nwill excoriate and kill them instantly.[2456] The congealed blood of an\r\nass is a constituent of a suffumigation which enables one to learn what\r\nthe future holds in store of good or evil.[2457] Indeed throughout the\r\nwork parts of animals are the favorite substances employed, although\r\nstones and herbs are also used.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Other marvelous experiments.]\r\n\r\nThe _Liber Vaccae_ abounds in suffumigations, marvelous houses,\r\ngolden or otherwise, and magic lamps and fires. One makes men appear\r\nin any form desired;[2458] another makes a house seem to be full of\r\nsnakes;[2459] or a lamp is extinguished by opening the hands over it\r\nand is relighted by closing them.[2460] Such marvels we shall find\r\nfrequently repeated in our following books of experiments. That of\r\nholding fire in the hand and not being burnt by it is here described\r\nas if quick-lime were used rather than alcohol.[2461] Other paragraphs\r\ntell how to plant seed and have it grow instantly,[2462] how to\r\nunderstand the language of the birds,[2463] how to answer questions\r\nabout persons who are absent,[2464] how to sit under a tree and cause\r\nit to incline toward you.[2465] The last recipe calls for the teeth,\r\nnose, and bones of a dead man. But perhaps we have sufficiently\r\nillustrated the character of the _Liber Vaccae_. Its necromancy should\r\nhave at least “provoked the silent dust” of Plato and of Galen.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Plato as an alchemist.]\r\n\r\nTo Plato and Galen, though never apparently again in partnership, were\r\nalso attributed various works of alchemy in the middle ages. Most\r\nwidespread would seem to have been _The Fourth Book_ or _Four Books_,\r\nwhich is found both in the manuscripts and in print. In an Oxford\r\nmanuscript[2466] it opens by Thebit, presumably ben Corat, asking Hasam\r\nto “tell us briefly what you have learned of the revelation of things\r\noccult and expound the book of old Plato.” Thebit also introduces both\r\nof the other parts of the book in this manuscript, but for the most\r\npart Hames tells us what Plato said. This indirect form of presentation\r\nis somewhat similar to that of the _Liber Vaccae_, and there is also\r\nmuch talk of abbreviating even in the fuller and different printed\r\nversion,[2467] which is divided into four books, but the contents\r\nare entirely alchemical and there is no mention of Galen. The work\r\nseems to be a translation from the Arabic and not a Latin forgery.\r\nBerthelot placed the Latin translation of the alchemical treatise of\r\nthe Pseudo-Plato about 1200.[2468] But there are in the manuscripts yet\r\nother works of alchemy ascribed to Plato, one of which, _The Thirteen\r\nKeys of Greater Wisdom_, is said to have been translated from Arabic\r\ninto Latin about 1301 A. D.[2469]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Galen as an alchemist]\r\n\r\nAs for Galen, a _Commentary of Galen upon Hermes’ Book of\r\nSecrets_[2470] turns out to be an alchemy of the incoherent and\r\nmystical variety. A _Practice in the Secrets of Secrets of Nature_\r\nascribed to him is obviously spurious, since it opens by citing Geber.\r\nIt is accompanied by a _Theorica_.[2471] Indeed, the _Practica_ is\r\nreally the same as the treatise usually ascribed to Archelaus.[2472]\r\nThere was perhaps a medieval alchemist named Galen, since a manuscript\r\nat Paris states that “Master Galienus the writer who is used in the\r\nepiscopate is an alchemist and knows how to whiten _eramen_ so that it\r\nis as white as ordinary silver.”[2473]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The _Eighty-eight Natural Experiments_ of Rasis.]\r\n\r\nThe _Eighty-eight Natural Experiments_ of Rasis[2474] are not medical\r\nbut a series of magic tricks and chemical experiments. Yet they are\r\nnot only ascribed to Rasis, or at least are said to be a selection\r\nfrom a larger work of his recently translated from Arabic into Latin\r\nat Toledo,[2475] but the translator seems to be the same mysterious\r\nFerrarius[2476] of the _Experimental Medicines_, while the opening\r\nwords[2477] are very similar to those of the _Secrets_ of Galen which\r\nGerard of Cremona is supposed to have translated, except that here we\r\nread, “You have asked me, friend Anselm” instead of Monteus.[2478]\r\nOnly fragments of the treatise seem to be extant but enough of the\r\neighty-eight experiments are preserved to illustrate their character.\r\nSerpents are assembled at a given spot by placing a snake in a\r\nperforated pot about which a slow fire is built in order to make him\r\nhiss and attract his kind. Fish are made to congregate similarly\r\nbeneath the surface of a river by letting down into the water at\r\nnight a lighted lantern with glass windows in its four sides.[2479]\r\nThe property of alcohol (_aqua ardens_) of burning on the tip of a\r\nfinger or from a cloth which has been dipped in it without consuming\r\nthe cloth or burning the finger is termed magical. To cook an egg in\r\ncold water, it is placed in quick-lime in a vessel, then cold water is\r\npoured in and the vessel tightly closed. Other experiments are to make\r\na ring hop about the house like a locust, to carry live coals without\r\ninjury, to light a candle from the rays of the sun, to blacken the face\r\ncompletely. More useful seem those experiments which consist in making\r\nalcohol, turpentine, or Greek fire.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Liber ignium_ of Marcus Grecus.]\r\n\r\nFollowing the three experiments just mentioned, in both the manuscripts\r\nof the _Eighty-eight Natural Experiments_ which we have just been\r\ndescribing, comes _The Book of Fires for Burning Enemies_ of Marcus\r\nGrecus.[2480] Since it is also found in other manuscripts,[2481] it\r\nwould appear to be a distinct treatise from the _Eighty-eight Natural\r\nExperiments_, although its form is similar. Berthelot already has\r\nbeen impressed by the close association in this treatise of “purely\r\nscientific compounds of combustible or phosphorescent substances\r\nand the preparations of prestidigitateurs and magicians.”[2482] For\r\ninstance, in an effort to make an inextinguishable fire glow-worms\r\nare pulverized and mixed with other substances and then warmed for a\r\ncertain number of days in horse manure.[2483] A lamp that will shed a\r\nsilvery light on everything in the house is obtained by smearing the\r\nwick with a liquid similar to quicksilver supposed to be obtained by\r\ncutting off a lizard’s tail.[2484] Or everything around will appear\r\ngreen, if the brain of a bird is wrapped in cloth and burned with\r\nolive oil on a green stone. If the hands are rubbed with an Indian\r\nnut or chestnut and “water of camphor,” a candle may be extinguished\r\nby opening them above it and relighted by closing the hands.[2485]\r\nOther ointments are said to keep one from being burned by a flame\r\nor by the red-hot iron in the ordeal.[2486] More scientific are the\r\nrecipes for oil of sulphur, gunpowder, Greek fire, alcohol.[2487] Two\r\nof the more fantastic experiments are said to have been discovered by\r\nAristotle for Alexander,[2488] and another cites Hermes and Ptolemy\r\nfor its “prodigious and marvelous works.”[2489] The reader will have\r\nnoticed the recurrence of some of the matters treated in the _Natural\r\nExperiments_ of Rasis. Such repetitions and resemblances are common in\r\nthe medieval collections of recipes and experiments.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Further experiments.]\r\n\r\nAt the close of the _Book of Fires_ of Marcus Grecus, in one of the\r\ntwo manuscripts[2490] where it follows the _Eighty-eight Natural\r\nExperiments_ of Rasis, the listing of experiments of the same sort\r\ncontinues without any new title and the consecutive numbering of them\r\nin the margin goes on up to one hundred and forty-four in all. It is\r\ndoubtful, however, how far we may regard these additional experiments\r\nas a resumption of the text of Rasis, which had been interrupted by\r\nthe work of Marcus Grecus, since we cannot arrive at an even number\r\nof eighty-eight experiments by any combination. These additional\r\nexperiments instruct us how to paint an image on the wall from which a\r\ncandle may be lighted, how to write letters that cannot be read unless\r\nthe material upon which they are written is placed near a fire or\r\ntouched with a rod, how to make cooked meat seem raw and wormy.[2491]\r\nThis trick, which is found frequently in medieval manuscripts, is\r\nperformed by making mince meat of the heart or dried blood of some\r\nanimal and strewing the particles upon the piece of cooked flesh, whose\r\nheat will make them move like worms, while their color is that of raw\r\nmeat. We are also instructed how to cook meat of a sudden, how to turn\r\na red rose white--apparently by fumigating it with sulphur, and how\r\nto make “marvelous bottles” (_ad faciendum ampullas mirabiles_)--the\r\ndirections seem to tell how to blow soap bubbles.[2492] How to emit\r\nfire from the mouth, to heat a bath, to construct an artificial mill\r\nin a camp, and to make all the bystanders appear headless.[2493] A\r\nscore of experiments are concerned with colors and dyes.[2494] To make\r\na dog follow you, place a piece of bread and butter under your armpit,\r\n“that it may receive the odor of the sweat,” and then feed it to the\r\ndog.[2495] A magical experiment to deprive a man of his urine consists\r\nin taking urine and earth on which someone has made water and enclosing\r\nthem together in the skin of a camel’s womb or a dog’s paw; “and he\r\nwill have no urine as long as the earth is enclosed in the skin.”[2496]\r\nThe last experiment, “that a wife may live a good life with her\r\nhusband,” involves writing an incantation upon parchment.[2497]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The _Secretum Philosophorum_.]\r\n\r\nFound together with the _Eighty-eight Natural Experiments_ of Rasis\r\nin one of the two manuscripts[2498] containing that work, and in\r\nother manuscripts together with the _Liber ignium_[2499] and _Liber\r\nVaccae_[2500] and _Experiments_ or _Secrets_ of Albert,[2501] is an\r\nanonymous work entitled _The Secret of the Philosophers_. As it seems\r\nto be found especially in English libraries,[2502] and mainly in\r\nmanuscripts of the fourteenth century,[2503] it was perhaps composed in\r\nEngland in the thirteenth century. At any rate it claims no connection\r\nwith Galen or Rasis. It is longer than most medieval collections of\r\nexperiments and subdivides into seven sections, each named after one of\r\nthe liberal arts.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Experiments connected with writing.]\r\n\r\nUnder the heading “Grammar” materials and instruments used in writing\r\nare first spoken of, then methods of writing, especially those employed\r\nby the wise to conceal their meaning, as when the alchemists use the\r\nnames of planets to denote the seven chief metals. Instructions are\r\ngiven for making colors employed in illuminating, ink, white tablets,\r\nand glues. We are told again how to write letters which are invisible\r\nuntil touched with a rod or exposed to fire. Also how to write so\r\nthat the writing can be read only in a mirror, how to erase writing\r\nwithout leaving any mark, how to engrave steel and other metals, and\r\nhow to color the letters so engraved. A paragraph on the right way of\r\nspeaking might seem to belong under the head of rhetoric rather than of\r\ngrammar, but just precedes the section of rhetoric in such manuscripts\r\nas I have examined. It warns against much speaking, citing Aristotle’s\r\nadvice to Alexander in the _Secret of Secrets_, and ends with the\r\nfamiliar couplet:\r\n\r\n    “If you would be wise, observe my five commands,\r\n    What you say, where, of whom, to whom, and when.”[2504]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Riddles: a trick with a knife.]\r\n\r\nThe section on “Rhetoric,” which is defined as speaking ornately, is\r\ndevoted to riddles, verbal deceits, quibbles, and catches. Under one of\r\nits sub-heads, Of Weights, we are told how to balance a knife, although\r\nits center is to project beyond the edge of a table and although a\r\nweight is to be hung on this projecting end. “The way to fulfill the\r\ndoctrine of this thing is to fix the blade of the knife in the end of a\r\nrod so that it makes an acute angle with the rod, and you will see how\r\nthe rod will hang with the knife.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Deceiving the senses.]\r\n\r\n“Dialectic” is concerned in our treatise not with logical fallacies but\r\nwith deception of the senses by various tricks. To make water look and\r\ntaste like wine, a bottle half full of water should be held or left\r\ninverted for a time over the orifice of a jar of wine. This procedure\r\nis recommended in cases where a patient wants to drink wine and the\r\ndoctor knows that it would not be good for him. In order to determine\r\nwhether a patient is really dead and to prevent cases of burial alive,\r\nit is recommended to hold a mirror to his nostrils and see if it will\r\nbe clouded by a faint breath. This comes under the sub-head, _De\r\nolfactus deceptione_, breathing as well as the sense of smell evidently\r\nbeing included under the olfactory organs. The sense of hearing is\r\ndeceived by an echo, and the sense of sight by mirrors which enlarge or\r\nmultiply objects or make an image appear outside the mirror. The use of\r\nburning glasses is also discussed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Tricks of jugglers.]\r\n\r\nUnder the sub-head, “Sophistries called sleight-of-hand,” (_De\r\nsophisticationibus que vocantur iugulationes_), come the tricks or\r\n_cautelae_ of the jugglers. An apple is made to move on a table\r\nby preparing a hole in the center beforehand and placing a beetle\r\ninside. To construct a cross that will seem to turn to right or left\r\nautomatically in answer to questions put to it concerning hidden or\r\nfuture matters, one builds it up of wax about the tail of some insect\r\nor tiny animal[2505] which is also concealed in wax and irritated with\r\nsage[2506] so that it wiggles its tail and the cross. Hands that have\r\nbeen bound may be freed by cutting the rope against a prearranged\r\nknife. Again we meet the experiments to make cooked meat seem raw\r\nor full of worms and directions for blowing soap-bubbles, a process\r\nwhich is spoken of as “making a golden sphere appear flying in the\r\nair.” Other illusions under “Dialectic” are to seem on fire and not be\r\nburned, to see stars in the daytime by multiplying the reflections of\r\nthe sun, to make a silver coin seem copper, and to deceive the sense of\r\ntouch by such methods as holding an object between two crossed fingers.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mathematical problems.]\r\n\r\nThe headings, Arithmetic, Music, and Geometry, are more exactly\r\nappropriate to their contents than Dialectic was. One problem in\r\narithmetic is to tell how many knights, esquires, and pages will be\r\nrequired to divide twenty loaves of bread, if each knight receives two\r\nloaves, if two pages share a loaf, and if four esquires share a loaf.\r\nUnder geometry are calculated surfaces, the cubic contents of various\r\nreceptacles, and the altitudes of inaccessible objects.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Astronomy: experiments with air: the magnet.]\r\n\r\nUnder “Astronomy” the rule of superiors over inferiors is affirmed and\r\nthe various attributes, properties, and effects of the planets are\r\nlisted. Then come “experiments with air” and many figures of vessels\r\npartly filled with water or other liquids. Siphoning is explained under\r\nthe heading, “Of the ascent of water on account of the consumption of\r\nthe air lest a vacuum be left.” By employing the same principle that\r\nAdelard of Bath observed in the magic water-jar of the enchantress, any\r\none of four different liquids that the spectators choose can be poured\r\nfrom a single faucet. Inside the jar are four compartments each with\r\nits own airhole above and outlet below, and beneath all four a common\r\nchamber into which they open and from which the common faucet pours.\r\nThe four air-holes are covered with the fingers, and as one of these is\r\nraised, the liquid will flow from the corresponding compartment. This\r\nis illustrated by a diagram of the contrivance. The magnet is discussed\r\nunder “Astronomy” “because it bears in itself a likeness of the sky.”\r\nThis discussion of the magnet and some of the accompanying figures\r\nresemble the treatise of Peter Peregrinus on the magnet, which was\r\nwritten in the thirteenth century.[2507] Here the work ends in two of\r\nthe three manuscripts which I have used,[2508] but in the third further\r\nexperiments are added.[2509] Some of these have occurred before in the\r\n_Secretum philosophorum_ itself, or in other experimental treatises of\r\nwhich we have already spoken. Others are to make fireworks,[2510] to\r\nsoften steel, to drive away crows, and to tell whether a person is a\r\nleper.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Le Secret aux philosophes._]\r\n\r\nNot to be confused with the Latin _Secretum philosophorum_, which we\r\nhave just described and which seems to be of English origin, is a\r\nwork in the French vernacular written at the end of the thirteenth\r\ncentury and entitled _Le Secret aux philosophes_.[2511] It is not a\r\ncollection of experiments but rather an encyclopedic discussion of\r\ntheological and metaphysical as well as natural problems in the form\r\nof a dialogue, presumably imaginary, although sometimes represented as\r\na translation, between Placides, the promising son of a petty king,\r\nand his master Timeo, who chose him as his pupil in preference to\r\nthe stupid son of a great emperor. Through this medium is retailed\r\nfor less learned perusal much of the knowledge and superstition,\r\nespecially astrological, to be found in the Latin and Arabic learning\r\nof the time. Perhaps the resemblance is greater to the _Secret of\r\nSecrets_ of the Pseudo-Aristotle than to any other treatise that we\r\nhave considered. The author, very weak and meager on theological\r\nand metaphysical matters, shows a much greater interest in natural\r\nscience and something of the spirit of experimental research. Yet in\r\na prologue “the compiler” gives his name as Jehan de Bonnet, priest,\r\ndoctor of theology, and native of Paris. Ernest Renan was impressed\r\nby the curiosity shown concerning problems of natural science, by the\r\n“search after realities” and by the experimental spirit of the book.\r\nThe solutions, as in the _Natural Questions_ of Adelard of Bath, often\r\nmake one smile, but “this naïve composition ... is superior to many\r\nscholastic treatises in Latin which deal purely with abstractions and\r\nwhere modern thought has not its true antecedents.” In this treatise,\r\non the other hand, “the science of reality has taken the upper hand”\r\nand “the idea of research is born.”[2512] But Renan was mistaken in\r\nthinking such scientific curiosity a new thing as late as the close of\r\nthe thirteenth century, and perhaps on that account overestimated its\r\nimportance in this case.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Natural Experiments of Solomon._]\r\n\r\nReturning to books of experiments, we may note a treatise whose\r\ncontents are very similar to the _Eighty-eight Natural Experiments_\r\nof Rasis, the _Book of Fires_ of Marcus Grecus, and the _Secretum\r\nphilosophorum_, namely, _Some experiments which King Solomon composed\r\nbecause of his love for, and the imploring of, a most excellent queen,\r\nand they are experiments of nature_.[2513] Instead of the experiment\r\nwith the snake in the pot we now have rats in a cage, whose squealing\r\nwhen a fire is heated is supposed to attract other rats. Again we are\r\ntold how to write invisible letters, how to make a candle burn in\r\nwater,[2514] how to light a candle from the mouth of an image painted\r\nupon the wall. This is done by painting the mouth with sulphur and\r\nturpentine and applying the wick of the candle to it just after the\r\ncandle has been blown out and before it has quite ceased to glow.\r\nQuicklime as well as sulphur and turpentine are used in an image that\r\nwill illuminate and take fire when water is poured over it. Quicksilver\r\nis placed with saltpeter and sulphur inside a ring in order that it may\r\nhop about when put near a fire.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Experiments without title or author.]\r\n\r\nSuch experiments sometimes occur without any title as well as\r\nwithout name of author, as in a manuscript where there are a dozen\r\nleaves filled with them between the treatise on plantations and the\r\nexperiments or secrets ascribed to Albert.[2515] Again we encounter the\r\njumping ring, the cooked meat turned raw, men made to appear headless,\r\nand artificial thunder which seems produced by use of gunpowder. There\r\nis much discussion of colors and alchemy and we are told how to make\r\n_sal ammoniac_ and “the best bitumen.”[2516] But the virtues of herbs\r\nand animals are not forgotten and many of the experiments are medical\r\nor magical. Instructions are given for making a white crow by tampering\r\nwith the crow’s egg, and how to make human hair grow again by the\r\napplication of the ashes of a mole, burned in a new pot, mixed with\r\nhoney. A cure for diarrhoea is to drink milk in which a glowing iron\r\nhas been quenched. Suspending the tongue of a goose over a sleeper has\r\nthe appropriate effect of causing him to reveal all his secrets, while\r\nthe suspension of the head of a bat prevents his waking. The bearer of\r\nthe herb _aristologia_ is safe from demons whether awake or asleep.\r\nTo escape from chains one should employ an incantation which contains\r\nallusions to the rescue of the apostle Peter from the sea and from\r\nprison.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Twelve experiments with snakeskin of John Paulinus.]\r\n\r\nFrequently found in the manuscripts are twelve experiments with\r\npulverized snakeskin which John Paulinus or John of Spain excerpted\r\nfrom the book in Arabic of the physician or physical scientist,\r\nAllchamus or Alchanus or Alanus or Alganus, or whatever his name may\r\nhave been,[2517] a book entitled _Life-Saver_ (_Salus vitae_).[2518]\r\nThis work, as John further informs us at its beginning, he discovered\r\nwhen he “was in Alexandria, a city of the Egyptians.”[2519]\r\nSteinschneider listed this John Paulinus as a different person from\r\nthe well-known twelfth century translator, John of Spain, but at\r\nleast in one manuscript[2520] he is called both John of Spain and John\r\nPaulinus.[2521]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Marvelous virtues of snakeskin.]\r\n\r\nAnother manuscript[2522] presents our treatise under the amusing\r\ncaption, “Twelve experiments with snakeskin and some of them true.” All\r\ndue credit should be given for such partial scepticism but it might\r\nwell have been made more sweeping. The snakeskin is to be pulverized\r\nwhen the moon is in the first degree of Aries, and one manuscript adds\r\nthat this must be the full moon.[2523] This powder will heal a wound in\r\nthe head, or will keep the head from being wounded, if it is sprinkled\r\non the hair. A face, washed with it and water, is terrible to foes and\r\nsecures the faithful allegiance of friends. If the powder is scattered\r\nin an enemy’s house, he will be unable to remain there. To secure an\r\nattentive hearing in a council, sprinkle a little at your feet. Place\r\nsome on the tip of the tongue, and you will be invincible in scientific\r\ndisputations. “And this has been tested many times.” This healing\r\nand magic powder also enables one to see into the future, to learn\r\nanother’s secrets, to insure the fidelity of a servant or messenger, to\r\nguard against poison, to win the love of a woman. If a leper eats some\r\nof it, his disease will grow no worse. This last experiment is perhaps\r\nsuggested by Galen’s story of the cure of skin disease by drinking wine\r\nin which a viper had died.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Other treatises concerning the virtues of snakes.]\r\n\r\nAt the end of these twelve experiments one manuscript adds that “John\r\nin the same book gives additional statements which Alcanus composed,”\r\nand continues with further suggestions concerning the medicinal\r\npreparation and uses of snakes and their skins and blood.[2524]\r\nSimilar are _Secrets concerning the Serpent_, which, according to a\r\nmanuscript of the fifteenth century in the Bodleian, Albertus Magnus\r\ngave to a doctor of sacred theology of the order of Friars Minor at\r\nNürnberg,[2525] and which direct how to prepare snakes and recount\r\ntheir medicinal virtues. It will be recalled, too, that in our\r\npreceding chapter we treated of the _Experiments_ of Nicholas of Poland\r\nwhich made considerable use of pulverized snakes or toads or scorpions,\r\nand which are sometimes found in the same manuscripts[2526] as the\r\n_Twelve Experiments with Snakeskin_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Chemical experiments of Nicholas.]\r\n\r\nPerhaps this is the same Nicholas to whom chemical experiments are\r\nattributed in two Oxford manuscripts.[2527] In the fuller manuscript\r\nthese experiments are numbered in the margin from one to twenty,[2528]\r\nbut sometimes more than one recipe or item is found under a\r\nnumber.[2529] Besides some alchemistic generalizations, such as the\r\nopening sentence which states that there are seven bodies, namely,\r\nSaturn, Jupiter, Mars, Sun, Venus, Mercury, and Moon, and a recipe or\r\ntwo for making gold and silver, the treatise consists of instructions\r\nfor the preparation of such chemicals as _sal ammoniac_, quicksilver,\r\narsenic, sulphur, and common salt, and of other recipes similar\r\nto those in the _Book of Fires_ of Marcus Grecus.[2530]The author\r\nfrequently cites the books and experiences of the philosophers but\r\nalso speaks of his own experiments. Once, for example, he supports the\r\nassertions of the philosophers by adding, “And I, Nicholas, say that\r\nI have tested these two operations experimentally”:[2531] in another\r\nplace he says of a powder recommended “by a very wise philosopher” that\r\nhe has not yet experienced it himself as the operation is long and\r\ndifficult.[2532]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Books of waters.]\r\n\r\nIn addition to the _Book of Fires_ of Marcus Grecus and the experiments\r\nwith air in the _Secret of Philosophers_, we must not forget the\r\ntreatises in medieval manuscripts devoted to marvelous waters,\r\nmedical and chemical. We have already seen such works attributed to\r\nAristotle[2533] and to Peter of Spain.[2534] At that time, of course,\r\nvarious liquid compounds and acids were known as “waters”; alcohol,\r\nfor instance, was called _aqua ardens_; and in one manuscript some\r\nof the “waters” are really dry or solid.[2535] As in the case of the\r\ntreatises ascribed to Aristotle and Petrus Hispanus, twelve seems to be\r\nthe favorite number in these medieval collections of waters, but the\r\ntwelve are not always the same,[2536] and sometimes, while the title\r\nsays twelve, the text will include more than that number.[2537] Such\r\na collection of twelve waters is sometimes ascribed to Rasis,[2538]\r\nand once to Vergil,[2539] but often occurs anonymously.[2540]\r\nOther treatises on waters in general and the fountain of youth in\r\nespecial are ascribed to famous names, Albert Magnus,[2541] Arnald of\r\nVillanova,[2542] and Thaddeus of Florence[2543] and of the University\r\nof Bologna, a thirteenth century writer upon anatomy and medicine\r\nwho lived from 1223 to 1303. We also encounter _Nine Waters of the\r\nPhilosophers_,[2544] _Physical Waters_,[2545] and a _Book of Saint\r\nGiles concerning the virtues of certain waters which he made while\r\ndwelling in the desert_.[2546] The saint would scarcely seem to have\r\nchosen the best place for the investigation of his subject. Such\r\nare a few specimens of medieval works on waters; many more might be\r\ncollected.[2547]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Colors.]\r\n\r\nExperiments with colors are also of rather frequent occurrence in\r\nmedieval manuscripts, and seem to a large extent to be anonymous. I\r\nhave not sufficiently examined them to be able to say what additions\r\nmay be made in the manuscripts of the thirteenth and fourteenth\r\ncenturies to the recipes already given in the _Compositiones ad\r\ntingenda_, _Mappe clavicula_, and works of Heraclius and Theophilus of\r\nwhich we have already spoken. Like the _Book of Twelve Waters_, but not\r\nso widespread, is a treatise on twelve colors and their virtues,[2548]\r\nwhile a Virgilius appears again as the author of _Pictorial Waters for\r\nPainting on Linen and Cloth_.[2549] The works on colors of Peter of St.\r\nAudemar, of John Alcerius, and of John le Bègue have been printed by\r\nMrs. Merrifield,[2550] but many brief anonymous collections of recipes\r\nconcerning colors still remain in manuscript.[2551]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Necromantic experiments.]\r\n\r\nOther examples of necromantic experiments are found in the manuscripts\r\nthan those of the _Liber sacratus_, _Picatrix_, and the _Liber Vaccae_,\r\nor those which are attributed to Michael Scot and Peter of Abano. An\r\nanonymous collection of “conjurations and invocations of spirits to\r\ndiscover thefts and other things of the sort” contains “among many\r\nother experiments” some concerning three angels in a crystal, a sibyl\r\nin a candle, four kings in a crystal, “a bearded old man,” and the\r\n_ars episcopalis_.[2552] A manuscript at Munich contains “A probable\r\nexperiment to provoke spirits from all four quarters of the universe,\r\nwhatever their condition, order, and station, by means of the mass.” “A\r\ngood experiment in astrology of Master John of Belton” turns out to be\r\nnecromantic, consisting largely in writing and repeating such words as\r\nthe Tetragrammaton.[2553]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Experimentum in dubiis._]\r\n\r\nAn “Experiment in cases of doubt” from an early thirteenth century\r\nmanuscript at Erfurt[2554] may perhaps be described more fully. It\r\nshould be begun during the March equinox early in the night with\r\npsalms and prayers. Starting forth to a spot where potter’s clay\r\nmay be found, one repeats the Paternoster and Credo as one leaves\r\nhis house or church. On the road he repeats seven psalms, and if he\r\nmeets any passers-by, returns no answer to them. Having reached the\r\npotter’s earth, he plants his heel upon it and turning successively to\r\nthe East, South, and North, repeats the magic word “Syos” to each of\r\nthose cardinal points. Turning to the East again, he utters a short\r\nprayer beginning, “Force eternal, innumerable power, true presence of\r\nthings, I suppliantly beg your clemency.” Then with a trowel with a\r\nwhite handle he cuts the earth about his heel, and digs up enough of\r\nit for his purpose, repeating the while a “Te Deum” and “Gloria in\r\nexcelsis.” Having secured the clay by this ceremony, when he wishes to\r\nsettle any doubtful question, he writes the words “Yes” and “No” on two\r\nbits of parchment, encloses these in pastilles of the clay, places a\r\ndish of holy water between the two pastilles, saying, “In the name of\r\nFather, Son, and Holy Ghost” and another pious phrase. Then he puts the\r\npastilles in the water, adjuring them by the names of Elias and Moses\r\nto show him the truth of the matter in question, and opens for his\r\nanswer the first pastille which floats towards him.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: “A natural experiment.”]\r\n\r\nWhat we should regard as specimens of downright sorcery and magic are\r\nsometimes presented in the manuscripts not merely as “experiments,”\r\nbut as instances of purely scientific procedure. Under the title, “A\r\nnatural experiment,” which, however, is likewise called “ineffable,” a\r\nwriter in a Paris manuscript[2555] describes three _Practicae_ which\r\nmay be used against enemies or serpents. Of these practical experiments\r\nthe most interesting is the first, which the writer learned of when he\r\nwas at Paris from Thomas de Pisan. This Thomas is also spoken of as\r\nof Bologna and as the physician of the French king. Evidently he is\r\nthe father of the poetess, Christine de Pisan, Thomas of Bologna, who\r\nmade astrological predictions and composed philters for the learned\r\nking, Charles V of France, and the duke of Burgundy, and who also\r\nwrote a letter on the philosopher’s stone.[2556] The object of Thomas’\r\n“experiment” was the expulsion of the English companies of mercenaries\r\nfrom the French kingdom. He procured earth from the center and the\r\nfour quarters of France and under a selected constellation made five\r\nimages of lead or tin in the form of nude men. On the forehead of each\r\nhe wrote the name of the king of England or one of the captains of the\r\ncompanies and on the jaw and breast astrological characters and names.\r\nThese images were hollow and were filled with the aforesaid earth and\r\nat the proper astrological moment were buried in the five aforesaid\r\nregions with an incantation to the effect that this was the perpetual\r\nburial and total destruction and annihilation of the said captain and\r\nking, and the permanent expulsion of him and every official or adherent\r\nof his “so long as this work shall endure by God’s will, Amen.” The\r\nimages were buried face down with their hands behind their backs, “and\r\nwithin a few months all the said companies had fled from the realm.”\r\nThe writer states that all three of his _Practicae_ are based on the\r\nfirst _Practica_ of Thebit ben Corath, and notes that Albert the\r\ncommentator has said in his _Mirror_[2557] that such images are purely\r\nnatural like medical recipes.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Variety of experiments in medieval manuscripts.]\r\n\r\nIt is hard to tell where to make an end of describing or even of\r\nmerely illustrating the many collections and isolated examples of\r\n“experiments,” medical, chemical, culinary, artistic, magical, and\r\nnecromantic, both of spurious and of anonymous authorship, to be\r\nfound in medieval manuscripts. There are “experiments, good and\r\nbest” which include such illusions as making a river appear to flow\r\nin a house;[2558] there are “some experiments in which occur many\r\nwords written in a mystic form with vowels omitted”;[2559] there is\r\nan experiment to catch birds which begins by using the tongue of\r\na dog;[2560] there are “Sounds of trumpets and other mathematical\r\nexperiments,”[2561] and “A booklet of experiments for this and\r\nthat,” which opens with instructions how to dissolve phlegmatic\r\nhumors.[2562] In a single manuscript are “incantations and other\r\nexperiments,” “Experiments of Alexander,” “experiments from Galen’s\r\nbook of _Dinamidia_,” “general experiments,” “Experiments of Rusticus”\r\nwho is perhaps Rusticus Elpidus, physician to Theodoric, king of the\r\nOstrogoths, and “Experiments of Parisius, Abbot of St. Mark’s.”[2563]\r\nA certain group of experiments seems to be associated in some way with\r\nthe emperor Frederick, presumably the Second.[2564] Another group of\r\nperhaps twenty-five experiments was collected at Paris about 1331 and\r\n“approved by divers doctors of the same dear university.”[2565] In an\r\nEscorial manuscript are experiments of a chancellor and cardinal.[2566]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: An experimental manuscript.]\r\n\r\nA manuscript which belonged to an English family in Northamptonshire\r\nin the fifteenth century and received some additional entries in\r\nthe sixteenth provides a good example of the scope and character\r\nof the experimental interest of those times. Omitting some brief\r\nfamily records, we find its main contents to be a calendar, list of\r\neclipses, table and chart of the influences of planets and signs on\r\nthe human body, treatises on flebotomy, on colors, a problem credited\r\nto Aristotle, verses on the seven liberal arts, medical recipes, a\r\n_compotus_, arithmetics, a _Sphere of Pythagoras_, the treatise of John\r\nPaul on experiments with snakeskin, Alfraganus on signs from thunder,\r\nwhat seem to be extracts from the _Herbarium of Apuleius_ and perhaps\r\nfrom the treatise of Sextus Papirius Placitus on animals which so often\r\naccompanies it. This last is accompanied by a memorandum to the effect\r\nthat there are many true things here and also many false ones. Charms\r\nand further recipes are followed by a treatise on the conduct of waters\r\nand siphoning and how to learn the altitude of objects, which is not\r\nunlikely to be an extract from the _Secretum philosophorum_. A treatise\r\non the moon in the twelve signs is followed by one “on philosophy\r\naccording to Aristotle with cases and experiments proving its thesis.”\r\nIt opens with the words, “In these things nature works in an occult\r\nfashion.” Next comes a charm in English, then more recipes in Latin,\r\nthe _Physiognomy_ of Aristotle, a treatise of chiromancy, a _Dream\r\nBook of Daniel_, a further discussion of colors, the familiar charm\r\nto find a thief by means of a loaf of bread, and various tricks and\r\nfireworks.[2567]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Experimental character of the Sloane manuscripts.]\r\n\r\nHow long this experimental literature, which we have been describing\r\nfor the medieval period, retained its popularity, and how large a\r\nplace it had even in the esteem of celebrated scholars and scientists,\r\nmay be inferred from the very prominent place which it occupies in\r\nthe manuscript collection of Sir Hans Sloane, which with his books\r\nand scientific collections formed the nucleus of the present British\r\nMuseum. Sir Hans Sloane, who lived for nearly a century from 1660 to\r\n1753, won such a reputation both as a medical man and a naturalist\r\nthat in 1727 he became physician to the king and succeeded Sir Isaac\r\nNewton as president of the Royal Society. Yet the manuscripts collected\r\nby this distinguished scientist contain about as much alchemy and\r\nastrology as they do medicine, while even in those of the seventeenth\r\ncentury experiments of every sort continue to play as great a part\r\nas ever before. Indeed the general tenor of the seventeenth century\r\nmanuscripts in the collection seems rather more superstitious than\r\nin those of any previous century. This may be due to the fact that\r\nsuperstition is being crowded out of the printed page by that time, and\r\nfinds a refuge only in private manuscripts, but I am doubtful if such\r\nwas the fact. We must remember that the seventeenth century was marked\r\nby the witchcraft delusion, and even Boyle had not quite lost faith\r\nin alchemy despite his _The Sceptical Chemist_. Perhaps, however, the\r\ncombined influences of the _Index Expurgatorius_, English censorship\r\nof the press, and the natural tendency or pretense of alchemy and\r\nmagic to adopt secret and cryptic methods, were enough to keep a\r\nnumber of works or “secrets” in manuscript form. Be that as it may,\r\nit certainly seems as if the recipe notion dominated the catalogue of\r\nthe Sloane manuscripts and especially so in those of the seventeenth\r\ncentury. I have not begun to note all the titles with the word or idea\r\nof experiment in them, but I should like to run over a considerable\r\nnumber of the subjects of seventeenth century manuscripts which I have\r\njotted down, and which I think will serve to illuminate the character\r\nof the science of that time, and its relation to the preceding medieval\r\nliterature in the same field.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Some seventeenth century experiments.]\r\n\r\nWe may begin with “Notable experimentall receipts taken out of the\r\nbooke of Hen. Rantzovius _de conservanda valetudine_.”[2568] We pass\r\non to “Small empirical experiments” in both German and Latin,[2569]\r\nand to “Doctor Collette’s Experyment for the memory” and several\r\nmedical receipts.[2570] “A new system for an experimental college” is\r\ndated 1680.[2571] In a long manuscript devoted to alchemy are found,\r\namong other items, “the experiment of some unknown,” “some remarks\r\nabout the magic image in a Benedictine monastery near Florence,”\r\n“a marvelous experiment from a book printed in Flanders, but in my\r\nopinion a deceit,” and some other “sophistical experiments.”[2572] To\r\na manuscript in which are contained “Severall receipts of my mother’s\r\nwhich she had chiefly in my Lord Berkeley’s family”[2573] soon succeeds\r\nanother in which four out of the six treatises are respectively\r\nanatomical, chemical, medical, and philosophical experiments.[2574] “An\r\nexperiment with a mirror, for theft” and so forth, is explained by the\r\ncatalogue as being “rather sundry charms by which experiments may be\r\nmade.”[2575]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: More recipes and experiments.]\r\n\r\n“Lady Rennelagh’s choise receipts, as also some of Capt. Willis, who\r\nvalued them above gold,”[2576] are probably not very different from “A\r\nBooke of Receipts collected on Sundry occations, being for the moste\r\npart such as are commonly used in shopps yett nott to be found in the\r\nLondon Pharmacopaeia; with some other receipts of certaine Chymicall\r\npreparations most in use in Apothecaries shopps with the way of makeing\r\nthem.”[2577] “L’arsenal des secrets,” besides recipes for making\r\npotable gold and various elixirs, contains “Diverses secrets curieux”\r\nin the way of directions how to stamp or cast metals, to make colors,\r\nink, and dyes.[2578] Thus we see that industrial processes are still\r\n“mysteries.” A method of shooting guns without noise[2579] excites\r\nour curiosity, but we recall that Thomas Browne classes among his\r\nVulgar Errors the belief in a “white powder that kills without report,”\r\nconcerning which, he wittily remarks, “there is no small noise in the\r\nworld.”[2580] We turn to “Experiments made at several times upon Oxe’s\r\ngalls,”[2581] to “Preparations and Experiments” and “Some excerpts from\r\nthe experiments of Andreas Michelius.”[2582] In a manuscript which\r\nconsists chiefly of recipes we find directions for making saltpeter and\r\ngunpowder and various kinds of fireworks.[2583] An experimental remedy\r\nfor the gout[2584] carries our thoughts back to Alexander of Tralles,\r\nwhile a manuscript written in 1579 consists of “A book of certain\r\nexperiments of physics, copied out of an old written book in old\r\nEnglish, bearing the date of 1329, by John Nettleton, with additions of\r\nmedical receipts and observations in a later hand.”[2585]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Magic experiments.]\r\n\r\nWe come to the books of magic in the manuscripts of the seventeenth\r\ncentury in the Sloane collection and find them full and running over\r\nwith “experiments.” “An excellent approved experiment to cause a thief\r\nto come again with the goods.” “An experiment to call out spirits that\r\nare keepers of treasure trove, either by an artificiall inchantment\r\nmagically, or otherwise by Divine justice.” “An introduction teaching\r\nthe use of the foregoing treates and thereby other experiments.”[2586]\r\nAnother manuscript has “some experiments and incantations and imperfect\r\nconjurations written by John Evans,” “some experiments for sport,”\r\n“an experiment with book and key to reveal the thief by the names of\r\nthe suspects,” and the equally superstitious experiments of William\r\nBacon.[2587] Elsewhere we meet “A magical treatise containing a\r\nnumber of experiments and directions to those that will call any\r\nspirit,”[2588] “Experiments for finding out stolen or hidden things by\r\nthe help of the Chrystal Stone,” “A noble experiment of King Solomon\r\nwith astrological tables,”[2589] “Experiments for love,” “Experiments\r\nfor all games,”[2590] “the doctrine of all experiments,”[2591] “some\r\nmagical experiments,” “many experiments of magic,”[2592] and so on and\r\nso forth; in short, magic experiments galore.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[2442] Steinschneider (1906), p. 44; (1862), p. 53.\r\n\r\n[2443] A Hebrew version is extant in a Munich MS (214, fol. 109v)\r\ndescribed by Steinschneider (1862), pp. 54-5.\r\n\r\n[2444] For a list of the MSS see Appendix I to this chapter.\r\n\r\n[2445] A _Liber tegimenti_ cited in the _De mirabilibus mundi_\r\nascribed to Albertus Magnus perhaps refers to our treatise, of which\r\nthe _De mirabilibus_ seems to make further use.

Quarto 361, English cursive hand of early 14th century, fol.\r\n24, I have not seen, and follow the description of it by V. Rose in\r\nhis “Ptolemaeus und die Schule von Toledo,” _Hermes_, VIII, 338-40,\r\nwhich is fuller than the notice in Schum. Rose knew of no other MS of\r\nthe treatise, but I have examined it in the following: Digby 67, 15th\r\ncentury, fol. 32.\r\n\r\nBoth MSS have the same prologue by Ferrarius, in which the number of\r\nexperiments is stated as eighty-eight, and both open with the same\r\nexperiment. Rose gives the headings of only fourteen others, and then\r\nbegins the Book of Fires of Marcus Grecus, “Nunc incipiet liber ignium\r\na marcho greco descriptus,” which, as Rose says, follows the same\r\nform of a series of experiments as the preceding Rasis. Indeed, in\r\nDigby 67 the experiments of both treatises are numbered continuously\r\nin the margin. The Rasis seems to end with the experiment numbered\r\n33, a circumstance which led Macray to describe it as containing 33\r\ninstead of 88 experiments. Digby 67, however, does not at present\r\ncontain experiments 1-33 inclusive, but only 1-5 and 27-33; apparently\r\na sheet is missing. The _Liber ignium_, beginning at experiment 34\r\nand at the same juncture as in the Amplon. MS, since the preceding\r\nexperiments in both cases were concerned with alcohol (_aqua ardens_),\r\nturpentine, and Greek fire, comprises twenty-five experiments, after\r\nwhich miscellaneous experiments carry the total number recorded in the\r\nmargin up to one hundred and forty-four. In the Amplon. MS the _Liber\r\nignium_ is followed by another experimental treatise entitled _Secreta\r\nphilosophorum_, of which more will be said presently.\r\n\r\n[2475] “In Toleno” or “In Coleno.”\r\n\r\n[2476] “Suus suo amicus amico Anselmo ferarius.”\r\n\r\n[2477] Strictly speaking there are two other sentences before the\r\nwords, “Rogasti me, amice Anselme....”\r\n\r\n[2478] Professor D. B. Macdonald warns me, however, that these are\r\ncommon opening words in Arabic treatises.\r\n\r\n[2479] This and the preceding experiment follow the _liber ignium_ of\r\nMarcus Grecus in CLM 197, 1438 A. D.; see Berthelot (1893) I, 124.\r\n\r\n[2480] First printed in 1804 by La Porte du Theil at the wish of\r\nNapoleon who had heard of the old recipes for Greek fire. Hoefer gave\r\na faulty edition of it in his _History of Chemistry_, 2nd edition, I,\r\n517-24. I have employed the text printed by Berthelot (1893) I, 89-135,\r\nfrom four continental MSS: BN 7156, 13-14th century; BN 7158, 15th\r\ncentury; CLM 267, about 1300 A. D.; CLM 197, about 1438 A. D. This\r\ntext is accompanied by a French translation, introduction, and notes.\r\nBerthelot’s discussion of Marcus Grecus suffers from his ignorance\r\nof the existence of other collections of experiments similar to it\r\nin MSS contemporary with it. He notes only its resemblance to the\r\n_De mirabilibus mundi_ ascribed to Albertus Magnus and to the books\r\nof secrets printed in the sixteenth century. Marcus Grecus seems not\r\nthe same as Mark, the canon of Toledo (Marcus Canonicus Toletanus) in\r\nthe twelfth century who translated into Latin the Koran and works of\r\nHippocrates, Galen, and Honein ben Ishak: see Steinschneider (1905), p.\r\n54.\r\n\r\n[2481] Besides the MSS used in his text Berthelot alludes to some MS\r\nof the _Liber ignium_ in England which belonged to a Mr. Richard Mead\r\n(probably, Professor D. B. Macdonald suggests, Dr. Richard Mead, the\r\neighteenth century London physician, many of whose books are now in the\r\nHunterian Museum, Glasgow), but does not mention Digby 67 and Amplon.\r\nQuarto 361, which we have described already; nor CU St. John’s 177,\r\n14th century (Italian), fol. 15v, “Incipit liber ignium a marco greco\r\nprescriptus”; nor Sloane 323, 14th century. fols. 162-5; nor Digby 153,\r\n14th century, fol. 179v-, where it is reduced to ten experiments.

It exists in two different manuscript versions and a\r\nthird repeatedly printed text for which no corresponding manuscript can\r\nbe found.\r\n\r\n[2512] HL 30: 576 and 593.\r\n\r\n[2513] Sloane 121, 15-16th century, fols. 90v-92r.\r\n\r\n[2514] The knowledge that sulphur and quicklime will burn when brought\r\ninto contact with water seems, as Berthelot has pointed out, (1893) I,\r\n95, to antedate Livy who writes (XXXIX, 13), “Matrones Baccharum habitu\r\n... cum ardentibus facibus decurrere ad Tiberim demissasque in aquam\r\nfaces, quia vivum sulfur cum calce insit, integra flamma efferre.”\r\n\r\n[2515] Arundel 251, 14th century, fols. 12-24.\r\n\r\n[2516] Possibly there is some connection with the chemical experiments\r\nof James Hutton (1726-1797), the geologist, and his discovery of a\r\nprocess for manufacturing _sal ammoniac_ from coal-soot.\r\n\r\n[2517] Steinschneider (1905), p. 51, also mentions _Alcharius_ and\r\n_Alcaus_. The catalogue of MSS at Munich gives _Alchabitii_; in a\r\nBologna MS we read _Aichauus_.\r\n\r\n[2518] Steinschneider (1905), p. 51, notes only four of the following\r\nMSS, namely, those starred:\r\n\r\nSloane 1754, 14th century, fol. 30, “De pelle serpentis 12 experimenta\r\net quaedam vera.” No author or translator is mentioned: the treatise\r\nimmediately follows the Experiments of Nicholas of Poland.\r\n\r\nRoyal 12-D-XII, late 14th century, fol. 111v.\r\n\r\nArundel 251, 14th century, fol. 35v.\r\n\r\nCU Trinity 1081, 15th century, fol. 69.\r\n\r\nBodleian 177 (Bernard 2072), late 14th century, fols. 29v-30r.\r\n\r\n* Ashmole 1437, 15th century, fol. 3v, “De corio serpentis.” John’s\r\nprefatory statement is omitted and no author is mentioned.\r\n\r\n* Amplon.

Illum autem librum fecit Aichauus fysicus.”\r\n\r\nArezzo 232, 15th century, fol. 80, “Secreta magistri Iohannis,” from\r\nthe fact that they follow the _Verbum abreviatum_ ascribed to Roger\r\nBacon are probably the alchemical treatise attributed to Bacon’s\r\ndisciple, the youth John, rather than our treatise.\r\n\r\nSloane 3679, 17th century, fol. 96v--, “Sequuntur quaedam Experimenta\r\nmirabilia de spolio serpentis quae Jo. Hispalensis ex Arabico\r\ntranstulit in Latinum ex libro salutis vitae Alcani philosophi Arabici.”\r\n\r\n[2519] “Hic incipiunt 12 experimenta naturalia de corio serpentis\r\ntranslata a johanne paulino ab arabico in latinum ut predictus\r\nphilosophus dicit cum ego Johannes essem in alexandria civitate\r\negipsiorum reperi ... hoc qui salus vitae appellatur....” Bodleian 177.\r\n\r\n[2520] Arundel 251, “Cum ego Johannis hyspanicus....”\r\n\r\n[2521] At least he seems to have been a different person from John of\r\nSt. Paul’s, a medical writer whose works will be found in a number\r\nof MSS in the collections of Amplonius and Sir Hans Sloane, and whom\r\nScott in his _Index_ to the Sloane MSS has identified both with the\r\ntranslator of the snakeskin experiments and with John Platearius.\r\n\r\nAnd still different from any of these would seem to have been\r\n“Ioannis Paulus de Fundis,” doctor of arts and lecturer on medicine\r\nand astronomy in the university, and astrologer of the commune, of\r\nBologna, whose _Tacuinus astronomico-medicus_, written in his own hand\r\nin February, 1435, is preserved in a MS of the University Library at\r\nBologna. Nor is this _Tacuinus_ to be confused with the earlier work of\r\nthat title translated by the Jew Faradj ben Salem for Charles of Anjou.\r\n\r\n[2522] Sloane 1754.\r\n\r\n[2523] Sloane 1754. These virtues ascribed to snakeskin are perhaps\r\nto be connected with the belief that the serpent renews its youth by\r\nchanging its skin every year: see J. G. Frazer (1918) I, 66.\r\n\r\n[2524] Royal 12-D-XII, fols. 112r-113r. Sloane 1754 ends immediately\r\nafter the twelfth experiment with the powdered snakeskin, while Arundel\r\n251 adds but one further sentence.\r\n\r\n[2525] Canon. Misc. 524, fol. 17r-v, “Secreta Alberti magni de serpente\r\ndedita uno doctori sacre theologie ordinis minorum de Norenbergia.”\r\n\r\n[2526] Sloane 1754 and CLM 534. Sloane 1754 also contains the following\r\nexperimental works which have not yet been mentioned: fols. 80-82,\r\n_Experimenta de sanguine_; fols. 197-201, 205-8, 212-8, 222-31,\r\n_Chimica experimenta varia_.\r\n\r\n[2527] Ashmole 1448, 15th century, pp. 119-28, de experimentis chemicis\r\nin viginti capitula distributis, opening, “Septem sunt corpora scilicet\r\nSaturnus, Jupiter,” and closing, “Et sic finitur opus Nicholai.”\r\n\r\nCorpus Christi 125, 14-15th century, fols. 90r-91v. This has the\r\nsame _Incipit_ and some of the same experiments, but is briefer. It\r\naddresses a certain William (fol. 90r) and cites Michael Scot (fol.\r\n91r).\r\n\r\nDuhem, III (1915) 443, note, cites from Digby 164, which I have not\r\nseen, “Chi sont les lettres de frère Nichole envoiiées à Bernard de\r\nVerdun et les lettres de frère Bernard envoiiées à frère Nichole sur la\r\npierre des philosophes.”\r\n\r\n[2528] This marginal numbering goes on from 21 to 64 in succeeding\r\ntreatises, including one on twelve waters, numbered 25 to 36.\r\n\r\n[2529] For instance, under 9. _Aqua pro igne Greco_, _Ignis\r\ninextinguabilis_, _Ignis quem invenit Aristoteles cum Alexandro_, _De 3\r\ngeneribus igneum_; under 10, _Ad accendendum ignem ad solem_, _Ut manus\r\nardere videatur nec ardeat_, _Ignis discurrens_, _Candele_, _Ignis ad\r\nsagittandum_.\r\n\r\n[2530] See the headings in the preceding note, and other chapters, most\r\nof which Black has already listed in his description of the MS, where\r\nhe says, “Some of the chapters are curious and highly deserve notice.”\r\n\r\n[2531] Ashmole 1448, p. 119.\r\n\r\n[2532] _Ibid._, pp. 125-6.\r\n\r\n[2533] See above p. 251.\r\n\r\n[2534] See above p. 500.\r\n\r\n[2535] BN 6514, fol. 40.\r\n\r\n[2536] In the Florentine MS, Palat. 887, 15-16th century, fols. 89-,\r\n91-, 93-4, three different books of twelve waters occur in succession;\r\nand Berthelot (1893) I, 70, has noted that the texts of the _Book of\r\nTwelve Waters_ are different in MSS, BN 6514, fol. 40 and BN 7156, fol.\r\n145v, and in the printed _Theatrum chemicum_, III, 104. Also in Ashmole\r\n1448, 15th century, occur two different _Books of Twelve Waters_, at\r\npp. 130-40, “Incipit liber de aquis qui dicitur 12 aquarum ... / ...\r\nexplicit tractatus 12 aquarum;” at pp. 193-6, “Hic incipit liber 12\r\naquarum Alkimie seu in Alkamica.”\r\n\r\n[2537] In the first _liber de aquis_ in Ashmole 1448 mentioned in the\r\npreceding note there are paragraphs numbered from 25 to 57 and more\r\nthan twelve waters are mentioned.\r\n\r\n[2538] Digby 119, early 14th century, fols. 205-6, Liber Rasis de aquis\r\n12 optimis, opening, “Aqua mollificatissima et nigrissima.”\r\n\r\nSloane 1754, 14th century, fol. 112r, “Incipit liber rasis de 12 aquis\r\npreciosis.

It ends, “Completus est liber\r\n   Anaguenis, id est, liber vaccae.”\r\n\r\n Corpus Christi 132, 15th century, fols. 139-66, has the same\r\n   title and opening as the preceding.\r\n\r\n CLM 22292, 12-13th century, fol. 68, Epistola de medicina,\r\n   opening, “Conferat tibi deus mores,” and ending, “Explicit\r\n   epistola Ameti” (a name which usually means the astrologer\r\n   Alfraganus); fol. 70, Prologus in librum Anguemis, of\r\n   which the text does not seem to follow, since at fol.\r\n   72 comes a commentary on the Aphorisms of Hippocrates.\r\n   In this early MS therefore we seem to have only the two\r\n   prologues.\r\n\r\n Amplon. Quarto 188, written in 1267 A. D., 1319, and\r\n   later, fols. 103-4, Liber vacce seu liber aggregacionis\r\n   diversorum philosophorum, opening, “Primor queritur\r\n   quare risus magis sequitur titillacionem,” and closing,\r\n   “significet fleubotomia predominari et odor debet et\r\n   etiam.” From its brevity and opening and closing words\r\n   this would seem to be only a fragment of our treatise.\r\n   Schum states that it was originally followed in the MS by\r\n   another treatise on nigromancy, since torn out, and that\r\n   in the sixteenth century the two works were given the\r\n   common title, “Liber vacce nigromanticus.” But perhaps it\r\n   is only a part of the _Liber Vacce_ that has been torn out.\r\n\r\n Florence II-iii-214, 15th century, fol. 57-, “Liber\r\n   institutionum activarum Platonis in quo Hunayn filius\r\n   Ysac sic loquitur;” fols. 59-72, “Inquit Hunayn, Galenus\r\n   dixit ... / ... completus est liber agregationis aneguemis\r\n   maioris et minoris Platonis cum expositione Unayn filii\r\n   Ysac et declaratione Galieni.”\r\n\r\n The treatise was once found in the library of St.\r\n   Augustine’s Abbey, Canterbury, 1275, vacca platonis.\r\n\r\n Among MSS which T. Allen had in 1622 but which are no longer\r\n   in the Digby collection was, in 16mo, Liber Anequems\r\n   Platonis, id est, Liber vaccae.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX II\r\n\r\nMANUSCRIPTS OF THE SECRETUM PHILOSOPHORUM\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the following MSS I have chiefly used Additional 32622, Digby 37,\r\nand Digby 153.\r\n\r\n CU Trinity 1214, good hand of late 12th century, fols.\r\n   71-82, is perhaps an earlier precursor of our treatise,\r\n   judging from the following headings given by James: “De\r\n   aque ductibus, de puteis fodiendis, de probatione aque\r\n   ... de fistulis organicis ... de calce ... de fabrica\r\n   ville rustice disponenda, de balneis ... de coloribus ...\r\n   de norme institutione, de horologii institutione ... de\r\n   solidamentis, de altitudine arborum sive turrium probanda,\r\n   probacio auri, de arte multiplicandi, de arte organizandi.”\r\n\r\n Amplon.

Manuscripts of _Picatrix_.\r\n\r\n _“Scientia ... semper acquirit et numquam diminuit; semper\r\n elevat et numquam degenerat; semper apparet et numquam se\r\n abscondit.”_\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Problem of date and authorship.]\r\n\r\nAnother celebrated medieval book of magic is that which usually goes by\r\nthe name of _Picatrix_, who is, however, cited in the work itself[2593]\r\nand would seem to have been only one of its authors, translators,\r\ncompilers, or sources. Nevertheless he is mentioned as author in the\r\ntitle, _Incipit_, and _Explicit_ of the manuscripts,[2594] and is\r\ncalled “very wise,” “a philosopher,” “most skilled in mathematics,” and\r\n“very learned in the arts of necromancy.” The treatise is also said to\r\nhave been compiled by Norbar the Arab in the twelfth century.[2595] The\r\nLatin manuscripts state that in 1256 it was translated from Arabic into\r\nSpanish by order of Alfonso the Wise; but when it was translated into\r\nLatin is not stated. There seem to be no Latin manuscripts older than\r\nthe fifteenth century, and none of our thirteenth century Latin writers\r\nseems to have been acquainted with the work. Peter of Abano, it is\r\ntrue, is charged by Symphorien Champier, writing in 1514,[2596] with\r\nhaving borrowed from _Picatrix_, but Champier does not substantiate\r\nhis charge and I have found no unmistakable evidence of it in Peter’s\r\nworks. Evidently, however, _Picatrix_ was well-known in Latin by 1514.\r\nRabelais, who lived from 1495 to 1553, speaks of “le reuerend pere en\r\nDiable Picatris, recteur de la faculté diabolologique” at Toledo.[2597]\r\nA Cambridge doctor about 1477 cites “Picatrix in his third book of\r\nmagic.”[2598] The work seems never to have been printed and J. Wood\r\nBrown expresses the hope that it may never be translated into any\r\nmodern language.[2599]\r\n\r\nLaw of Alfonso the Wise concerning magic and astrology.\r\n\r\nIt was fitting that such a work should have been translated from the\r\nArabic under the patronage of Alfonso X, the Wise or Learned, who is\r\nnoted for his astronomical tables, and whose favorable attitude toward\r\nastrology and magic may be seen from the law on those subjects in his\r\ncode of the Seven Parts.[2600] Divination of the future by the stars\r\nis sanctioned in the case of persons properly trained in astronomy,\r\nalthough other varieties of divination are forbidden. And while those\r\nwho conjure evil spirits or who make waxen, metallic, or other images\r\nwith the aim to harm their fellows are to be punished by death; those\r\nwho employ incantations with good intentions and good results are\r\npronounced deserving of reward rather than penalty. Thus no objection\r\nis made to magic procedure but only to evil intentions and results.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Picatrix_ a confused compilation.]\r\n\r\n_Picatrix_ divides into four books and is accompanied in the\r\nmanuscripts by tables of contents which, however, are not as helpful\r\nas might be expected, since the work really has no plan and the\r\ndivision into books and chapters is quite arbitrary.[2601] In short,\r\nthe work is a confused compilation of extracts from occult writings\r\nand a hodgepodge of innumerable magical and astrological recipes. The\r\nauthor states that he “has compiled this book,” that he intends to set\r\nforth “in simple language” what past sages have concealed in cryptic\r\nwords, and that he has spent some six years in reading two hundred and\r\ntwenty-four books by “ancient sages.”[2602] Whenever modern compilers\r\nof the notions of folk-lore and the magical customs of aborigines shall\r\nhave exhausted their resources, a rich mine will still await them in\r\nthis book of magic. We can give but a few specimens of its contents\r\nhere.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mentions of magic.]\r\n\r\nFor _Picatrix_ is openly and professedly a book of magic. At the close\r\nof the first of its four books we are told that its contents are “the\r\nroots of the magic art” and that “without them one cannot become\r\nperfect in such arts.”[2603] Throughout all four books such phrases are\r\nused as “magic works,” “magic effects,” “magical sciences,” and “the\r\noperator of magic,” and books of magic are cited by Abrarem (Abraham?),\r\nGeber, and Plato.[2604] It is true that the term necromancy is also\r\nemployed frequently and a chapter devoted to its definition,[2605] and\r\nthat astrological images and invocations of demons are the subjects\r\nmost discussed. So in a way the work is primarily a treatise of\r\nastrological necromancy. But it is said on the supposed authority\r\nof Aristotle that the first man to work with such images and to\r\nwhom spirits appeared was Caraphrebim, the inventor of the magic\r\nart.[2606] It is also affirmed that the science of the stars is the\r\nroot of magic, that the forms of the planets or astronomical images\r\n“have power and marvelous effects in magic operations;” while after\r\nannouncing his intention of listing “the secrets of ancient sages in\r\nthe magic art,” the first thing that our author divulges is that the\r\ninfluence of Saturn exceeds the influence of the moon.[2607] Evidently\r\nlittle distinction is made between astrology and magic. On the whole\r\nthen, although magic is not defined at length in _Picatrix_, it seems\r\njustifiable to apply it as a general term covering the contents of the\r\nbook, and to regard astronomical images and invocations of demons as\r\ntwo leading features of the magic art.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Magic and science.]\r\n\r\nPicatrix regards magic as a science, as a superior branch of learning,\r\nto excel in which one must first master many other studies. He\r\nbelieves that the greatest philosophers of antiquity, such as Plato\r\nand Aristotle, have written books of magic. Hermes is also cited\r\nfrequently. Our author also has a high appreciation of science which\r\nin his first chapter he declares to be God’s greatest gift to man.\r\n“It always is making acquisitions and never diminishes; it ever\r\nelevates and never degenerates; it is always clear and never conceals\r\nitself.”[2608]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Use of natural virtues.]\r\n\r\nMuch use of natural objects is made in the various recipes of\r\n_Picatrix_. Here is one brief example: Adam the prophet says that if\r\nyou take fourteen grains of the fruit of the laurel tree, dry them\r\nwell and pulverize them and put the powder in a very clean dish in\r\nvinegar, and beat it with a twig from a fig tree, you can make anyone\r\nyou wish possessed of demons by giving him this powder to drink.[2609]\r\nOne chapter is especially devoted to “the virtues of certain\r\nsubstances produced from their own peculiar natures,” and the author\r\nfurther explains that “in this section we shall state the marvelous\r\nproperties of simple things, as well of trees as of animals and of\r\nminerals.”[2610] Hermes is quoted as saying that there are many marvels\r\nfor necromancy in the human body,[2611] and various parts thereof\r\nare often employed by Picatrix. Thus in making a magic mirror a\r\nsuffumigation is employed of seven products of the human body, namely,\r\ntears, blood, ear-wax, spittle, _sperma_, _stercus_, _urina_.[2612]\r\nIndeed, vile and obscene substances are in great demand for purposes of\r\nmagic throughout the book. Picatrix, like the _De mirabilibus mundi_,\r\nconsiders heat an important force in magic and mentions both elemental\r\nand natural heat, the former referring to the use of the element fire\r\nin sacrifice, suffumigation, and the preparation of magic compounds,\r\nthe latter designating the heat of digestion when simples or mixtures\r\nmust be eaten to take effect.[2613]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Magic compounds.]\r\n\r\nAlthough we have found one chapter devoted to the virtues of simples,\r\nin actual magical procedure several things are generally combined, as\r\nin a suffumigation with fourteen dead bats and twenty-four mice, to\r\ngive a comparatively simple example.[2614] On the supposed authority\r\nof Aristotle in a book written to Alexander, detailed instructions\r\nare given how to make four “stones” of great virtue and of elaborate\r\ncomposition by procedure more or less alchemistic.[2615] Indeed, there\r\nare listed all sorts of “confections,” compounds, and messes, either\r\nto burn or to sacrifice or to eat or to drink or to smell of or to\r\nanoint oneself with, in order to bring various wonders to pass. The\r\ningredients employed include different oils and drugs, butter, honey,\r\nwine, sugar, incense, aloes, pepper, mandragora, twigs, branches,\r\nadamant, lead, sulphur, gold, the brains of a hare, the blood of a\r\nwolf, the urine of an ass, the filth of a leopard, and various portions\r\nof such further animals as apes, cats, bears, and pigs. Besides the\r\nactual ingredients all sorts of receptacles and material paraphernalia\r\nare called into requisition: vessels, jars, vases, braziers, crosses,\r\ncandles, crowns, and so on.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Things required of the magician.]\r\n\r\nMuch is said of the magician himself as well as of the materials which\r\nhe employs. He should have faith in his procedure, put himself into an\r\nexpectant and receptive mood, be diligent and solicitous.[2616] Often\r\nchastity is requisite, sometimes fasting or dieting, sometimes the\r\nwearing of certain garments.[2617] He must have studied a long list\r\nof other sciences before he can attempt necromancy, but then he must\r\ndrop all other studies and devote himself to it exclusively. A little\r\nknowledge of necromancy is a dangerous thing, and the ignorant meddler\r\ntherein is liable to be violently slain by indignant demons.[2618]\r\nMuch depends also upon the magician’s personality and natural fitness.\r\nNo one can succeed in the science of images unless his own nature is\r\ninclined thereto by the stars. Some men are more subtle and spiritual,\r\nless gross and corporeal than others, and hence more successful in\r\nmagic.[2619] The ancients, when they wished to employ a boy in magic,\r\nused to test his fitness by fire as well as make sure that he was\r\nphysically sound.[2620]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Magic procedure.]\r\n\r\nIt has already been implied that great stress is laid upon procedure\r\nin _Picatrix_. Extensive use is made of images of the person or thing\r\nconcerned. Thus an image of a fish is employed to catch fish, and to\r\nbewitch a girl a waxen image of her is made and dressed in clothes\r\nlike hers. In both cases, however, there is additional ceremony to be\r\nobserved. In the image of the fish the head should first be fashioned;\r\nfurthermore the image of the fish is to be poised on a slender rod of\r\nsilver and this is to be stood erect in a vessel filled with water.\r\nThis vessel is then to be hermetically sealed with wax and dropped to\r\nthe bottom of the stream in which it is proposed to fish.[2621] In the\r\nbewitching of the girl, which is recounted as an actual occurrence,\r\nthe object was to make her come to a certain man. Hence another image\r\nwas made of him out of a pulverized stone mixed with gum, and the two\r\nimages of man and girl were placed facing each other in a vase where\r\nseven twigs of specified trees had been arranged crosswise. The vase\r\nwas then buried under the hearth where there was a moderate fire and\r\na piece of ice. When the ice had melted, the vase was unearthed and\r\nthe girl was immediately seen approaching the house. In the reverse\r\nprocess to free her from the spell a candle was lit on the hearth, the\r\ntwo images were taken out and rudely torn apart and an incantation\r\nuttered.[2622] To make a spring that is going dry flow more freely a\r\nsmall and comely virgin should walk up and down beating a drum for\r\nthree hours, and then another small and good-looking girl should join\r\nin with a tambourine for six hours more. To ward off hail storms a\r\ncompany of people should go out in the fields, half of them tossing\r\nhandfuls of silk or cotton (_bombix_) toward the sky and the other\r\nhalf clapping their hands and shouting as rustics do to frighten away\r\nbirds.[2623] Tying seven knots and saying an incantation over each is\r\nanother specimen of the ceremonial in _Picatrix_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Invocation of spirits.]\r\n\r\nRitual also plays an important part in the invocation of spirits. If\r\none wishes to invoke the spirit called “Complete Nature” he must enter\r\na spick and span room while the moon is in the first degree of Aries.\r\nVarious receptacles filled with different foods and combustibles must\r\nbe arranged in a certain way on a table. Then he must stand facing\r\nthe east and invoke the spirit by its four names seven times and\r\nrepeat a prescribed form of prayer for increase of knowledge and of\r\nmoral strength.[2624] To draw down the virtue and power of the moon\r\none crowns oneself in the favorable astrological hour and goes to a\r\ngreen spot beside a stream. There he beheads with a bone--under no\r\ncircumstances employing iron--a cock with a divided crest. He stands\r\nbetween two braziers filled with live coals on which he casts grains of\r\nincense gradually until smoke arises; then, looking toward the moon,\r\nhe should say, “O moon, luminous and honored and beautiful, thou who\r\nshatterest darkness by thy light, rising in the east and filling the\r\nwhole horizon with thy light and beauty, I come to thee humbly asking a\r\nboon.” Having stated his wish, he withdraws ten paces, facing the moon\r\nthe while and repeating the above formula. Then more incense is burned\r\nand a sacrifice performed and characters inscribed on a leaf with the\r\nashes of the sacrifice and a bit of saffron. This leaf is then burned,\r\nand as its smoke rises the form of a well-dressed man will appear, who\r\nwill answer the petition.[2625]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Necromancy and astrology.]\r\n\r\nThroughout _Picatrix_ planets and spirits are closely associated.\r\nMany instructions are given how to pray to each of the planets and\r\nto work magic by their aid, just as if they were demons. It is hard\r\nto say whether the spirits are more thought of as forces in nature\r\nor the stars as gods. A necromancer who does not know astronomy is\r\nhelpless, and each planet has a list of personal names associated not\r\nonly with itself but with its every part and position.[2626] Lists are\r\nalso given of the boons which one may ask from each planet, and of\r\nthe stones, metals, animals, trees, colors, tinctures, odors, places,\r\nsuffumigations, and sacrifices appropriate to each planet and sign of\r\nthe zodiac, in order that one may use the proper materials, eat the\r\nright food, and wear the right clothes when petitioning any one of\r\nthem.[2627] Let us remember, too, that the natural qualifications of\r\nthe magician depend upon his horoscope.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Astronomical images.]\r\n\r\nFinally _Picatrix_ devotes much space to astronomical images,[2628]\r\nwhich, engraved preferably upon gems in accordance with the aspect\r\nof the sky at some instant when the constellations are especially\r\nfavorable, are supposed to receive the celestial influences at their\r\nmaximum and store them up for future use. That they receive “the force\r\nof the planets” and produce marvelous works, such as the invocation\r\nof demons, is in our author’s opinion “proved by nature and by\r\nexperiment.” He lists images for forty-eight figures made from the\r\nfixed stars, for the twenty-eight mansions of the moon, for the signs\r\nof the zodiac and for the planets. One of the images for Saturn will\r\nsuffice as an example: “A man erect on a dragon, holding a sickle\r\nin his right hand and a spear in his left hand, and clad in black\r\nclothing and a panther skin.” This image “has power and marvelous\r\neffects in magic works.”[2629] Characters composed of lines and\r\ngeometrical figures are also derived from the constellations and are\r\nsupposed to possess marvelous efficacy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Aims and results of magic.]\r\n\r\nSome of the results attributed to images and characters are to\r\ndrive away mice, free captives, throw an army into a town, either\r\nrender buildings safe and stable or impede the erection of them, the\r\nacquisition of wealth, making two persons fall in love, making men\r\nloyal to their lord, making the king angry with someone, curing a\r\nscorpion’s sting, walking on water, assuming any animal form, causing\r\nrain in dry weather and preventing it in rainy weather, making the\r\nstars fall or sun and moon appear divided into many parts. The\r\npossessor of such images can further ascend into the air and take on\r\nthe form of a falling star, or speak with the dead, or destroy an enemy\r\nor city, or traverse great distances in the twinkling of an eye. The\r\naims of incantations, invocations, and recipes are similar, as has\r\nalready been indicated in several cases. Ten “confections” are listed\r\nthat stop evil tongues; eight, that generate discord and enmity; six,\r\nthat cure impotency, if taken in food; seven, that induce a sleep like\r\nunto death; ten, that induce a sleep from which one never wakes.[2630]\r\nOthers prevent dogs from barking at you, produce green tarantulas or\r\nred snakes, remove bothersome frogs from pools, cause water to burn\r\nand appear red, enable you to see small objects a long way off, make\r\nthe winds and tempests obey you, deprive others of memory or sense or\r\nspeech or sight or hearing, and so on through a long list. The aims are\r\ninfinitely varied, and are sometimes good, sometimes evil.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[2593] II, 10, “Haec autem figurae planetarum quemadmodum translatas\r\ninvenimus in lapidario mercurii et in libro beelum (probably meant for\r\nBeleni) et in libro spirituum et in ymaginibus quas transtulit sapiens\r\npicatrix.” Magliabech.

Otherwise,\r\nhowever, their contents are often not identical although roughly\r\ncorresponding. I have also examined Sloane 1305 and found it in general\r\nsimilar to the other two.\r\n\r\n Vienna 3317, 15th century, 114 fols., Picatrix, De magia,\r\n   “Ad laudem et gloriam altissimi ... / ... fel leonis est.”\r\n\r\n Magliabech.

Steinschneider notes that in Hanover 396, 17th century, a work\r\nof magic in Italian, Picatrix is spoken of as a Hebrew philosopher, and\r\nthat in the aforesaid Ashmole MS are “Tabulae motionis octavae spherae\r\nmoventis ab occidente ad orientem octo gradus in 640 annos secundum\r\nordinem Picatricis.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXVII\r\n\r\nGUIDO BONATTI AND BARTHOLOMEW OF PARMA: AN ASTROLOGER AND A GEOMANCER\r\n\r\n\r\n Guido Bonatti and Dante--The _Liber astronomicus_ of\r\n Guido Bonatti--Career of Bonatti--Arrangement of the\r\n _Liber astronomicus_--Astronomy and astrology--Truth of\r\n astrology--Theological opposition--Bonatti’s defiant\r\n rejoinder--Astrological predictions for Christians and the\r\n clergy--Instances of Bonatti’s detailed treatment--The\r\n planet Jupiter--An astrological image--The _Geomancy_ of\r\n Bartholomew of Parma--How to proceed in geomancy--Questions\r\n answered by geomancy--Appendix I. Some Manuscripts of the\r\n _Liber Astronomicus_ of Guido Bonatti.\r\n\r\n    “_Vedi Guido Bonatti...._”\r\n                       --_Inferno, XX, 118._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Guido Bonatti and Dante.]\r\n\r\nWith these words Vergil calls the attention of Dante and ourselves to\r\nthe presence of that astrologer in the fourth division of the eighth\r\ncircle of the Inferno among those spirits who in life had tried to pry\r\ntoo far into the future and were condemned henceforth to look backwards\r\nwith turned heads. This is all that Dante says of Bonatti, although\r\nBenvenuto of Imola, the fourteenth century commentator upon the _Divine\r\nComedy_, adds a number of tales concerning him, some of which may be\r\ntrue but most of which are stock stories like that of the speaking\r\nbrazen head, told of many other medieval men of learning. But we may\r\nperhaps associate Bonatti and Dante in our minds a little further.\r\nForlì, Bonatti’s native city, lies almost in a direct line between\r\nFlorence, where Dante lived his early life, and Ravenna, where he ended\r\nhis exile. Indeed, Filippo Villani[2631] and Fossi[2632] would persuade\r\nus that Guido Bonatti, too, was born a Florentine but, like Dante,\r\nbecame an exile from the town of his birth and called himself a native\r\nof Forlì because he came to hate the place of his birth which he had\r\nleft on account of the strife of political factions. Finally, Bonatti\r\nand Dante had a common interest in astronomy.[2633]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The _Liber astronomicus_ of Guido Bonatti.]\r\n\r\nThe most important astrological work produced in Latin in the\r\nthirteenth century seems to have been the _Liber astronomicus_ of\r\nthis Guido Bonatti,[2634] which is a voluminous work divided into\r\nsome ten or a dozen treatises.[2635] In the preface, after some of\r\nthe usual devout opening phrases of medieval authors, Guido states\r\nthat he writes the book particularly for the use of his nephew, that\r\nthe work will be “long and prolix” and that on this account he will\r\nnot include “disputations nor many proofs.” He proposes to compile a\r\nwork from past authors which can be understood by those who do not yet\r\nknow much of other sciences “and especially for your use, Bonatus, my\r\nnephew.” Indeed, the annalist of Forlì states that Bonatti expounded\r\nthe doctrine of astrology so clearly in this book that “it seemed\r\nas if he wished to teach women astrology.”[2636] Guido employs such\r\nclassical authorities as Ptolemy, Hermes, and Dorotheus, but still\r\nmore such Arabian astrologers as Alcabitius, Albumasar, Messahala,\r\nand Thebit ben Corat.[2637] He also states that he has made additions\r\nof his own,[2638] and many passages demonstrate that he has made\r\ndetailed practical application to the present problems of medieval\r\nlife of the principles of his art established in the past. The\r\npopularity and influence of Guido’s work is attested by the numerous\r\nmanuscripts, including an interesting _de luxe_ manuscript of it and\r\nother astrological treatises made for the use of Henry VII of England,\r\nwhose picture is given in the midst of Bonatti’s text.[2639] There are\r\nalso several printed editions of the Latin text and translations of the\r\nwork into several modern languages. There is an Italian translation\r\nof it in a manuscript in the Laurentian library at Florence; a German\r\ntranslation was printed at Basel in 1572; and an English translation by\r\nWilliam Lilly appeared in print at London in 1676.[2640] Thus Dante’s\r\nconsignment of Bonatti’s soul to hell does not seem to have kept people\r\nfrom reading his _Liber astronomicus_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Career of Bonatti.]\r\n\r\nThe battle of Valbona, fought in 1277, seems to be the latest event\r\nmentioned by Bonatti. He also speaks of having himself seen many\r\nevidences of the cruelty of Ezzelino, and of that tyrant’s death, which\r\noccurred in 1259. He was alive as early as 1223, when he mentions\r\nhaving seen a certain man.[2641] Guido seems to have been a professor\r\nat the university of Bologna. He must have died before 1300, when\r\nDante’s visit to the Inferno is supposed to have occurred. Bonatti’s\r\ndeath, however, would seem to have been comparatively recent, since\r\nthe _Annals of Forlì_[2642] represent him as playing a prominent part\r\nin the defense of that town in 1282 by the famous captain, Guido of\r\nMontefeltro, against a large force sent by Pope Martin IV. Though\r\nBonatti himself was loyal, it was in a wheat field belonging to him\r\nthat conspirators gathered in a vain attempt to betray the town, while\r\nthe enemy later encamped outside the city in another field belonging to\r\nhim and called, “Of the oak tree.”\r\n\r\nThen Guido of Montefeltro, we are told, “captain of the people of\r\nForlì, together with lord Guido Bonatti, a citizen, philosopher,\r\nand most eminent astrologer, having called the people together in\r\nthe public square,” instructed them as to the strategem of a mock\r\nwithdrawal from town and subsequent return by which he intended later\r\nto take the superior forces of the enemy unawares after they had\r\nentered the town in triumph and were overcome by feasting and drinking.\r\nThe strategem turned out a complete success, and the _Annals_ give much\r\nof the credit to Bonatti, by whose counsel, art, and forecasting the\r\nfuture it is said to have been planned. He was wounded in the battle,\r\nwhile carrying medicines, but this too he had foreseen and foretold.\r\nLater, when the pope sent more mercenary troops into Romagna, Forlì\r\ndeemed it prudent to submit, and Guido of Montefeltro transferred his\r\nmilitary activities elsewhere and finally, we are told, made his peace\r\nwith the pope and spent his declining years in the Franciscan Order.\r\nSome say that Bonatti followed his patron into the convent, but it\r\nseems very improbable in view of the hard things which he had said of\r\nthe friars. On the other hand, judging from the number of Franciscans\r\nwho have written works on astrology and astrological medicine, he might\r\nnot have found such retirement entirely uncongenial, and need scarcely\r\nhave surrendered his astrological views in consequence.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Arrangement of the _Liber astronomicus_.]\r\n\r\nBut we turn to the contents of the _Liber astronomicus_. Bonatti’s\r\nfirst treatise is a general introduction in which he defines his\r\nsubject, discusses its utility, and meets the objections of its\r\nopponents. The second treatise[2643] deals with the signs of the\r\nzodiac and their characteristics and subdivisions. The third treatise,\r\nin two parts,[2644] deals with the planets, their influences on\r\nthings on earth and their effects on one another. The fourth treatise\r\ndeals chiefly with conjunctions. The remaining treatises comprise\r\n146 considerations affecting astrological judgments, another brief\r\nintroduction of three chapters to the subject of judgments,[2645]\r\ndiscussions of the four chief departments of astrological prediction,\r\ninterrogations, elections, revolutions, and nativities, and a final\r\ntreatise upon prognostication of changes in the weather.[2646]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Astronomy and astrology.]\r\n\r\nAs the title, _Liber astronomicus_, shows, Bonatti generally uses the\r\nword “astronomy” where we should say “astrology” and _vice versa_. He\r\nstates, for instance, that nativities, elections, interrogations, and\r\nrevolutions are four varieties of “astronomy,” which he distinguishes\r\nfrom other forms of divination.[2647] He also says, however, that\r\nthe words “astronomy” and “astrology” may be used interchangeably.\r\nHe regards both as of great value in the study of first philosophy.\r\nThrough these sciences we come to know impassive and unalterable\r\ncreatures who cannot be changed into any other essence, and through\r\nthese creatures we can attain to as much knowledge of the Creator as\r\nthe human mind can reach. Nobler than the profession of the physician\r\nwho deals with the four inferior and corruptible elements is that of\r\nthe astrologer whose concern is with superior and incorruptible bodies\r\ncomposed of the fifth essence.[2648]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Truth of astrology.]\r\n\r\nBonatti asserts confidently and vehemently all the main suppositions\r\nof the astrological art. He affirms that its principles ought not to\r\nbe proved but assumed, since they all reduce to one point which he\r\ndoes not believe that anyone doubts, namely, that the motion of the\r\nheavens surrounding the elements alters fire and air and that these\r\nalter the other elements, earth and water.[2649] “All wise men agree\r\nin this, that inferiors are ruled by superiors.”[2650] The astrologer\r\nunderstands every motion of each heavenly body; therefore he knows what\r\nimpressions they make and what their significations are. “Therefore all\r\nthings which are being done now or have existed in the past or will be\r\ndone in the future, can be known by the astrologer.”[2651]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Theological opposition.]\r\n\r\nIt will hardly be profitable for us to follow Bonatti’s rehearsal of\r\nfamiliar arguments for and against the influence of the stars and\r\nthe practicability of the art of astrology. But we may well note\r\nthose passages in which he suggests the existence of a contemporary\r\necclesiastical and theological opposition to his art. Bonatti at\r\nleast does not appear to have any fear of the clerical detractors of\r\nastrology, of whom he speaks quite disdainfully, hurling back at them\r\nthe charges of heresy which they had perhaps directed at him. “I would\r\nhave you know,” he affirms in the introduction to his treatise on\r\nElections, “that fortune rules in everything, although some fools among\r\nthose wearing the tunic (that is, the friars) may say that fortune does\r\nnot exist, but only what God wills. But the wiser of them dissent from\r\nthis in secret, although they may seem to assent in public, rather\r\nfrom fear that their Orders be thought less of than from a conviction\r\nof its truth. For if fortune did not exist, who would be so stupid as\r\nnot to know how to acquire at will an abundance of the necessaries of\r\nlife? Yet we daily see quite the contrary. For do you not see wise men\r\nof integrity and intelligence who do not have enough to eat?” Bonatti\r\nconsequently contends that those who deny the existence of fortune\r\n“impute madness to their Creator, falsely representing Him as unjust,\r\nand falling into a hateful heresy.” He then continues, “And although at\r\ntimes many fools and idiots in tunics have arisen against me, declaring\r\nelections to be of absolutely no value, nevertheless elections and the\r\nother parts of astronomy have stood in their strength, nor has their\r\ntruth diminished any on this account.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Bonatti’s defiant rejoinder.]\r\n\r\nAs for those self-styled theologians who object that the stars are\r\nso countless in number that their influence cannot be measured and\r\nestimated, Bonatti assures them that astrologers know vastly more about\r\nthe stars than the theologians do about God, “Of Whom they none the\r\nless preach daily.”[2652] He further asserts that the holy fathers of\r\nold employed astrology, that Abraham taught it to the Egyptians, and\r\nthat Christ implied the truth of the doctrine of elections. For when\r\nthe disciples endeavored to dissuade Him from returning to Judea,\r\nwhere recently He had been nearly stoned to death, He replied, “Are\r\nthere not twelve hours in the day?” meaning that He might now select\r\na more fortunate time than before. “And this makes it plain that\r\nHe used elections and did not blaspheme astronomy as some jealous\r\ndetractors do today.” Bonatti then mentions “some silly fools, of whom\r\nthat hypocrite, John of Vicenza, of the Order of Preaching Friars was\r\none, who said that astrology was neither an art nor a science.” Guido\r\nscarcely thinks it worth while to notice such men.[2653] This John of\r\nVicenza mentioned by Bonatti was the well-known friar of that name to\r\nwhom manifold miracles were attributed and who in the Alleluia year of\r\n1233 had been made duke of Vicenza, but so abused his power that he was\r\nsoon imprisoned and discredited. Bonatti complains that no one had ever\r\nseen a single one of the eighteen men whom John was said to have raised\r\nfrom the dead, and affirms that he himself long sought in vain for\r\nanyone who had either been cured by John or had himself witnessed one\r\nof John’s miracles.[2654] On the other hand, the friar Salimbene tells\r\nus in his _Chronicle_ that Guido Bonatti, who reviled the preaching of\r\nthe friars, “was so confounded by” a “Brother Ugo before the university\r\nand people of Forlì that he not only feared to speak, but even to show\r\nhimself during all the time that the Brother was in those parts.”[2655]\r\nBut perhaps Brother Hugo was one of those persons whom Guido thought it\r\nscarcely worth while to notice.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Astrological predictions for Christians and the clergy.]\r\n\r\nAgainst these allusions to an opposition to astrology among the friars,\r\nor at least, among the Dominicans, should be set other passages which\r\nindicate that Bonatti’s book is intended for the use of Christians and\r\neven of the clergy, whose preaching and practice anent astrology seem\r\ndivergent. One of the illustrations which he employs against those\r\nwho argue that it is better not to know the future, since to learn of\r\nills beforehand will only make one so much the sadder, is that even\r\nif one learns that his disease is fatal, he is forewarned to make\r\nhis will and receive the last sacrament in season.[2656] Among the\r\ninterrogations which Bonatti lists are whether a bishopric or abbotship\r\nor cardinalate, or other clerical dignity, rank, or order, even up to\r\nthe papacy, will be attained by the inquirer.[2657] In this connection\r\nGuido grants that it may not seem honorable to seek ecclesiastical\r\noffices, but that the fact is that many clergy do it and that it\r\nis necessary for the astrologer to be prepared to answer them, if\r\nthey consult him as to their prospects. In the treatise on elections\r\ninstructions are given how to choose the favorable hour for building\r\nchurches as well as castles and cities. The treatise on revolutions\r\ntells what will be the state during any year of the bishops and other\r\nsecular clergy or the religious and regular clergy, as well as of\r\nother social classes such as kings or princes, rich men or magnates,\r\nsoldiers, women, merchants, populace, and serfs. Indeed, that even\r\na Preaching Friar in the middle ages was not necessarily opposed to\r\nastrology, is seen from an Oxford manuscript of the fifteenth century,\r\nwhere not far from _Rules one should know concerning various matters\r\nrelating to the sick, according to Guido Bonatti and others_, is a\r\ntreatise in astrological medicine by Nicholas of Aquila of the Order of\r\nPreachers.[2658]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Instances of Bonatti’s detailed treatment.]\r\n\r\nWe may not follow Bonatti through his long technical discussions\r\nof houses and exaltations of the planets, of _triplicitates_ and\r\n_termini_, of why the naming of the signs of the zodiac begins at\r\nAries and not at any other sign, or of what part of the body each\r\nplanet signifies in each sign, and a hundred other similar questions.\r\nIt must suffice to give a few suggestions of the thoroughness of his\r\ndetailed treatment. The treatise on nativities promises to reveal\r\neverything which will “naturally”--a saving word for those who insist\r\non freedom of the will--befall the child from birth to death, “and\r\nalso what will be said of him after death.” Pursuant of his promise,\r\nGuido considers such topics as length of life, physical and mental\r\nqualities, offices and property to be held by the person concerned,\r\nthe fate of his brothers, parents, and children, serfs, and domestic\r\nanimals, his sickness or health, mental afflictions, marriage, feuds,\r\ndeath, religion, learning, and journeys. The treatise on interrogations\r\nanswers questions on all sorts of matters from winning crowns or\r\ngaining one’s freedom to learning how many courses and what kind of\r\nfood there will be at a dinner to which one has been invited and\r\nwhich one is in a quandary whether to accept or not. The treatise\r\non elections selects favorable hours for any and every act of life\r\nfrom weaning and circumcising infants to trimming one’s nails, hair,\r\nand beard. The treatise on revolutions descends from the fate of\r\nmonarchs and nations during the year in question to such matters as the\r\nprospects for a good crop of melons or cucumbers.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The planet Jupiter.]\r\n\r\nSome further idea of Bonatti’s method and content may be derived\r\nfrom the following translation of his account of the properties,\r\nsignifications, and effects of the planet Jupiter.\r\n\r\n “Alchabitius has said that Jupiter is fortunate, masculine,\r\n diurnal; and is by nature significant of property, since\r\n property is the second accident that happens to the child\r\n after birth ... and Jupiter is second in the order of the\r\n planets. Jupiter is likewise the second planet to exert\r\n its influence on the child before birth, giving it spirit\r\n and life. And its nature produces heat and moisture, and\r\n is temperate, aerial, and sanguine. Of man’s age Jupiter\r\n signifies the period called _iuventus_ from youth to the\r\n prime of life, namely, from fourteen or twenty-one to forty\r\n or forty-five years. It governs those offices pertaining to\r\n law and just and honest judgments. And it attends when it\r\n sees any persons engaged in altercation or litigation, and\r\n makes peace between them and bestows harmony upon them, and\r\n ever is engaged in good pursuits. And it signifies abundant\r\n property. And such business occupations as are performed\r\n without deceit.\r\n\r\n “It signifies spirit, life, joy, religion, truth, patience,\r\n and every precept that is good, lovely, and precious, and\r\n everything that is honorable. It indicates abundant charm.\r\n Of infirmities it signifies those due to excess of blood....\r\n It is the planet of wisdom, of intellect, of sound practice.\r\n Moreover, if Jupiter be well disposed and in the east and\r\n at a favorable angle, the child will be of good quality,\r\n benign, just; he will honor the aged, and will be a good\r\n counselor, a helper of the needy, and of good repute. He\r\n will cherish his friends; he will be of good intellect.\r\n\r\n “But if Jupiter shall be unfavorable, Ptolemy is witness\r\n that the child will be ignorant of well doing, versed\r\n in diabolical practices, that he will intrigue under a\r\n hypocritical exterior, will linger in places of prayer,\r\n will gladly live in crypts and caverns and caves, and there\r\n will predict the future. He will love no one, though he may\r\n have a few friends; he will abhor his children, will shun\r\n human conversation, will seek no honors from anyone, will\r\n be untrustworthy, and no one can depend on him. In fine, he\r\n will be bad, weak, stupid, weary and heavy-laden, of evil\r\n election.”\r\n\r\nHaving thus considered the properties of Jupiter _per se_, Bonatti next\r\nproceeds to record its tendencies when in conjunction with Saturn and\r\nthe other planets.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: An astrological image.]\r\n\r\nOne of the stories told of Bonatti may be noted in conclusion, since it\r\nconcerns an astrological image. Pitying a poor apothecary with whom he\r\nused to play chess, Guido gave him a wax image of a ship, telling him\r\nto keep it hid in a box in a secret place and he would grow rich, but\r\nthat if he removed it, he would grow poor again. True enough, the man\r\nbecame wealthy, but then began to fear lest the image be the work of\r\nwitchcraft. So, having made his fortune, he decided to save his soul\r\nand confessed concerning the image to a priest who bade him destroy it.\r\nBut then, as Bonatti had predicted, he rapidly lost his entire fortune.\r\nHe then begged Guido to make him another image, but Bonatti cursed him\r\nand told him that the image had been no magic one but had derived its\r\nvirtue from constellations which would not recur for another fifty\r\nyears.[2659]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The geomancy of Bartholomew of Parma.]\r\n\r\nIf the _Liber astronomicus_ of Guido Bonatti was the leading Latin work\r\non astrology in the thirteenth century, probably the most elaborate\r\ntreatise in the associated art of geomancy was that by another\r\nItalian, Bartholomew of Parma, who appears to have written a long\r\n_Summa_[2660] on the subject in 1288 in Bologna at the request of\r\nTheodosius de Flisco, bishop-elect of Reggio in northern Italy;[2661]\r\nand then in October, 1294, a briefer treatment for two German friends\r\nand disciples named John and Paul,[2662] and again in November, 1295,\r\nanother abbreviated treatment for the beginner.[2663] Titles in\r\nmanuscripts at Vienna indicate that Bartholomew also wrote astrological\r\ntreatises,[2664] but perhaps they would prove to be merely extracts\r\nfrom his longer work on geomancy, although Houzeau and Lancaster\r\ngive the date of a _Liber de occultis_ by him as 1280.[2665] None of\r\nBartholomew’s works seems to have been printed. The interest of the\r\ncanon of Laon and bishop elect of Reggio in the art of geomancy is\r\nanother of numerous indications that we have had that such occult and\r\nsuperstitious arts were at least not consistently condemned by the\r\nchurch and clergy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: How to proceed in geomancy.]\r\n\r\nBartholomew of Parma tells us that the art of geomancy originated from\r\nGod and was taught to the sons of Noah by an angel who took on human\r\nform before the time of the flood. Whoever intends to practice that art\r\nshould be “a friend of God” and a good man of praiseworthy life. No\r\none should make use of it without real necessity of knowing the future\r\nand geomancers should beware of persons who try to catch them in error\r\nby asking questions about sure things. On the other hand, in certain\r\ncases one may ask questions for another person, and even without his\r\nknowledge, and questions may be put at any time and place, for the\r\nart of geomancy is simple and easy of operation. The only instrument\r\nneeded is something to make a series of points or marks with. These\r\ndots should be set down in four rows like the four fingers of a hand,\r\nbut at random without noting how many dots one puts in each row or how\r\nlong the row is.[2666] These four rows indicate the elements, points\r\nof the compass, and so on. Next one cancels the points in each line,\r\ncancelling two at a time until only one or two points remain in each\r\nline. When this is done we have one of the following sixteen possible\r\ngeomantic figures, which I have indicated numerically rather than\r\ngraphically: 2121, 2212, 1211, 1222, 2111, 2222, 2112, 2211, 1212,\r\n2122, 1121, 2221, 1112, 1111, 1221, 1122. Of these the first eight are\r\nfavorable, the last eight are unfavorable. They bear such names as\r\ngain, white, childhood, joy, head (_acquisitio_, _albus_, _pueritia_,\r\n_laetitia_, _caput_). The first inventors of the art are supposed to\r\nhave worked out these figures “with great ingenuity and subtlety” from\r\ncareful observations of the stars and of the virtues of the sky. Hence\r\nthese figures have the property of signifying much concerning the\r\nfuture. Each is associated with some particular sign of the zodiac and\r\nwith one of the planets. Also with a day, month, color, odor, taste,\r\nstone, tree, metal, and human type.[2667]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Questions answered by geomancy.]\r\n\r\nAmong the questions which geomancy undertakes to answer are how long\r\none will live, whether one will better one’s present position, whether\r\none should enter the clergy or remain a layman, whether a journey will\r\nbe dangerous, whether a rumor is true or false, whether to buy or not,\r\nwhether the year will be a fertile one, and concerning gain and loss,\r\nhidden treasure, the condition of a city or castle, and which side\r\nis stronger in a war. Whether a child will be born or not, of what\r\nsex it will be, and whether it is legitimate or a bastard. Which of\r\ntwo magistrates is superior in wisdom, whether a scholar can by study\r\nbecome an honor to the convent or not, whether the soul of some dead\r\nperson is in paradise or before the doors of paradise or in purgatory\r\nor in hell. In answering such questions the figure found by chance\r\nfrom the points is compared with and related to figures appropriate to\r\nthe person inquiring and the thing sought, and a decision is rendered\r\naccording as enmity or friendship is found to exist between them. In\r\ndetermining this the figures are reduced to terms of the twelve signs\r\nof the zodiac, and the astrological aspects are thus investigated.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[2631] Cited by Boncompagni (1851), p. 5.\r\n\r\n[2632] Fossi (1793-5), p. 395.\r\n\r\n[2633] Orr (1913). p. 4. says: “Where Dante speaks of appearances he is\r\nremarkably accurate, far more so than most modern artists and writers\r\nof fiction.”\r\n\r\n[2634] My citations, unless otherwise specified, will be to the\r\nfollowing edition of Augsburg, 1491: _Liber astronomicus Guidonis\r\nBonati de forlivio explicit feliciter.

But now we have a much fuller treatment\r\nof his life and works by Hauréau in the _Histoire Littéraire de la\r\nFrance_,[2669] while the researches of Menéndez Pelayo[2670] in the\r\nVatican library and the crown archives of Aragon have brought to light\r\nnew documents of importance. Subsequently Chabás has discovered an\r\nold and authentic copy of Arnald’s last will and testament in the\r\ncathedral archives of Valencia.[2671] Further materials bearing upon\r\nhis career appeared in Finke’s _Acta Aragonensia_,[2672] and have\r\nbeen written up by Diepgen in a monograph on Arnald’s political and\r\ntheological activity after 1299.[2673]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: His twofold importance.]\r\n\r\nArnald’s personality and career have long attracted attention, not\r\nonly because of his prominence as a practicing physician and writer\r\non medicine and alchemy, and because of his close relations with\r\nseveral kings and popes. He also is noted for his connection with\r\necclesiastical history, his relations with the Spiritual Franciscans\r\nand the theologians of Paris, and for his criticisms of existing\r\nconditions in the church of his time,--criticisms which he combined\r\nwith Joachimite ideas of a speedy end of the world and coming of\r\nAntichrist. These points long ago caused his inclusion in Matthias\r\nIllyricus Flacius’s _Catalogue of Witnesses to the Truth who before\r\nour time attacked the primacy of the Roman pontiffs and the various\r\nsuperstitions, errors, and impious frauds of Popery_,[2674] and more\r\nrecently in Menéndez Pelayo’s _Historia de los heterodoxos españoles_.\r\nAnd it is true that Arnald composed a violent diatribe against the\r\nregular clergy of his day and also a _Sword of Truth against the\r\nThomists_.[2675]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Narrative of his life.]\r\n\r\nArnald was a Catalan, although Pope Clement V speaks of him as “a clerk\r\nof Valencia.” Arnald writes of his youth as a time of hardship and\r\nof himself as “a country practitioner” without literary culture. Yet\r\nhe came to shine at courts and to defy synods of learned doctors of\r\ntheology. He also mentions his early education in a Dominican convent\r\nand his study of medicine at Naples under John Calamida. During his\r\nentire life he seems to have been continually moving about, and his\r\nworks speak of observations and operations in many towns of Spain,\r\nItaly, and France. Some of his treatises were written in Valencia,\r\nothers in Barcelona, others in Naples, or in Gascony, Piedmont,\r\nBologna, Rome, and even Africa. He was often called abroad to render\r\nmedical services to popes and other potentates and was frequently\r\nemployed in foreign diplomacy by the kings of Aragon and Sicily. By\r\n1285 he had won a sufficient reputation as a physician to be called\r\nfrom Barcelona to attend Peter III of Aragon in his last illness. Peter\r\ngave him a castle in Tarragona. After that Arnald seems to have taught\r\nat Montpellier which was then under the jurisdiction of Aragon. Three\r\nlater bulls of Clement V in 1309 making regulations for the medical\r\nfaculty at Montpellier mention Arnald of Villanova as one of the\r\npersons by whom the pope has been advised in the matter, and speak of\r\nhim as having “once long ruled” in that university.[2676] Astruc tells\r\nus that in the eighteenth century the house where he had lived was\r\nstill shown in Montpellier, ornamented with sculptured figures which\r\nwere interpreted as magic symbols.[2677]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: In theological difficulties.]\r\n\r\nIn 1292 Arnald composed a treatise on the significance of the\r\nholy name, _Tetragrammaton_, both in Hebrew and Latin, and on the\r\ndeclaration of the mystery of the Trinity. This and later essays of his\r\nin the field of religion were not well received by most theologians,\r\nwho would have preferred that he confine his efforts to medicine.\r\nIn 1299 Arnald was sent to Paris with a message from James II of\r\nAragon to Philip the Fair. Here he was arrested by the inquisition,\r\nbut was bailed out the next day, Nogaret being among those who stood\r\nsecurity. Presently he was brought to trial before the bishop and\r\nthe theological faculty of Paris for a work predicting the coming of\r\nAntichrist about the middle of the fourteenth century upon the basis of\r\npassages in Daniel and the Erythrean sibyl, and his book was ordered\r\nto be burned.[2678] Arnald protested to the king of France and later\r\nto a crowd of distinguished people at the bishop’s palace and appealed\r\nto Pope Boniface VIII. Finally he was allowed to leave France and in\r\nNovember, 1301, is found at Genoa.\r\n\r\nArnald submitted to Boniface VIII a slightly modified version of his\r\nwork on Antichrist, accompanied by a tone of pious self-abnegation\r\nand considerable shrewd flattery of the pope as “Christ on earth” and\r\n“God of gods.” The theologians of Paris, however, had sent a portion\r\nof the original text to the pope with the result that Boniface kept\r\nArnald in prison for a time and forced him to abjure his work in\r\nsecret consistory, but finally said that Arnald had erred only in\r\nnot submitting the work to him in the first place. After Arnald had\r\ntreated Boniface successfully for the stone, that pontiff’s estimation\r\nof him greatly improved, and he received favorably a new work which\r\npredicted the history of the Mediterranean world for the next century\r\nuntil the coming of Antichrist, bewailed the worldliness of the clergy,\r\nbut upheld the papal power, to which, of course, Arnald looked to\r\nfurther the ecclesiastical reforms which he had at heart. Boniface\r\nalso presented Arnald with a castle at Anagni, but the sun proved too\r\nhot there for Arnald’s head. Early in 1302 he left the papal curia,\r\nin April he received permission from King James II to dispose of his\r\nproperty in Valencia. His writings on Antichrist and against certain\r\nof the clergy continued, and in February, 1304, he was at Marseilles\r\ncomplaining before the bishop of some Dominicans who had attacked\r\nhis treatises. He then addressed himself to the new pope, Benedict\r\nXI, at Perugia, but was not well received, and complained that the\r\npope had judged and punished him before hearing him. But Benedict’s\r\nbrief pontificate was soon over and Clement V showed himself more\r\ngracious.[2679]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Events of 1305.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile in April, 1305, Arnald returned to Barcelona where he\r\nfound James II sick abed and very glad to see him and to entrust\r\nhimself to his medical care rather than that of Ermengard Blasius (or\r\nBlasii)[2680] who had hitherto attended James. About this time Arnald\r\nseems to have interpreted a dream for James, but that monarch later\r\nrepudiated Arnald’s account of the affair and they were estranged for\r\na time.[2681] Arnald’s will, drawn up on July 20, 1305, by a public\r\nnotary of Barcelona, informs us concerning his library, other property,\r\ngenerosity to the poor, and reveals the fact that he had a wife and\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The close of his life.]\r\n\r\nArnald, however, still had several years of life before him. A\r\ndeclaration has been preserved which he made in 1306 concerning the\r\nobservance of certain statutes at the University of Montpellier.[2682]\r\nJames II employed him in 1306-1307, and he corresponded with Clement\r\nV and Philip IV. In 1308-1309 he interpreted a dream for Frederick of\r\nSicily and with him concocted a scheme for a crusade and reform of the\r\nchurch, in pursuance whereof he went to Rome, Barcelona, and Avignon,\r\nand carried letters back and forth between James and Frederick.[2683]\r\nArnald had been with Clement V at Bordeaux and seems to have been with\r\nhim again at Avignon in 1309, but he does not appear to have been the\r\npope’s official physician,[2684] although very probably he rendered him\r\nsome medical service. About this time he also seems to have written\r\nseveral treatises in medicine and alchemy, including his _Preservation\r\nof Youth_, for King Robert at Naples. Raymond Lull speaks of meeting\r\nhim there and acknowledges his debt to his friend Arnald for one of his\r\n“Experiments.” A letter of December 6, 1311, from Escarrer at Naples\r\nto King James shows that Arnald died in the closing months of that\r\nyear.[2685] In 1312 we find Clement V advertising by public letter for\r\na medical treatise by Arnald intended for his perusal but which the\r\ndeath of the author had prevented from reaching its destination.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Arnald and the Inquisition.]\r\n\r\nAlready during Arnald’s lifetime in 1305 the inquisitor of Valencia\r\nforbade the possession or reading of his books, a decree against which\r\nKing James protested. Five years after Arnald’s death the inquisitor\r\nand provost of the church at Tarragona declared some statements in\r\nArnald’s writings heretical, and Diepgen thinks that we have lost a\r\nnumber of his religious writings in Catalan in consequence;[2686] but\r\nthis sentence appears to have no more lessened his medical influence\r\nthan his trial at Paris had prevented his having intimate relations\r\nwith the popes.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: His works.]\r\n\r\nOne indication of Arnald’s long continued influence in the learned\r\nworld is that some seven so-called complete editions of his works\r\nwere printed in the course of the sixteenth century.[2687] Besides\r\nthis, some of his writings were published separately or appeared\r\nin miscellaneous collections, and some were translated into the\r\nvernacular languages. Some, however, still remain in manuscript\r\nform. The majority of his writings are medical, such as the _Mirror\r\nof Medical Introductions_, _Breviary of Practice_, _Rule of Health_,\r\n_General Rules for the Cure of Disease_, _Commentary on the Regimen\r\nSalernitanum_, _Collection of Antidotes_, and special treatises on the\r\nstone, gout, and epilepsy. But besides the works of alchemy ascribed\r\nto him there are other treatises on themes of especial interest to\r\nus, the _Disapprobation of Sorcerers_ (_Libellus de improbatione\r\nmaleficiorum_), _Remedies against Sorcery_, _Judgments of Infirmities\r\nby the Motion of the Planets_, and the treatise on _Seals_ or\r\nastrological images. Although Arnald interpreted dreams for kings, the\r\ntreatise on interpretation of dreams which is printed with his works is\r\nin the manuscripts either anonymous or ascribed to William of Aragon.\r\nSome of these other works too are perhaps not by him, but similar\r\nthemes are occasionally touched upon in his more purely medical works.\r\nIn the printed editions of his works is found a Latin translation of\r\nthe treatise of Costa ben Luca _On physical ligatures_, which we have\r\nalready discussed, and it is not unlikely that some of the aforesaid\r\nworks are translations from the Arabic and not original compositions by\r\nArnald. Some of his medical writings seem little more than repetitions\r\nof Galen, whose works he cites a great deal.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: His attitude to natural science.]\r\n\r\nIn one of his medical works Arnald states that the proverbs of Solomon\r\nshow that what learned men have revealed in the world of nature can be\r\nadapted by convenient metaphor to moral instruction. But from this one\r\nshould not jump to the conclusion that he thought that the chief use\r\nof natural science was to point a moral. On the contrary in almost the\r\nnext sentence we find him affirming that “all true knowledge arises\r\nfrom the senses” and that the education of youth should begin with\r\nthis sense knowledge, “graciously and efficiently demonstrated.” Thus\r\nArnald would assign to natural science a leading place in education.\r\nAs the mind went over this material, he thinks that it would reach\r\nmany abstract conclusions, and could gradually attain “to the\r\nknowledge of insensible and occult and arduous and subtle things, as is\r\nillustrated by the whole course of theology and by the whole course of\r\nmedicine.”[2688]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Magic excluded from medicine.]\r\n\r\nThere are passages in Arnald’s works where, like Pliny, Galen,\r\nand other writers since them, he professes to exclude everything\r\nsavoring of magic and superstition from his medicine. For instance,\r\nin his chapter on _Those things whose use is permitted in the cure\r\nof epilepsy_, a disease into whose treatment we have seen that magic\r\nis especially liable to enter, he would “repel the ignominious”\r\nenchanters, conjurers, and invokers of spirits, diviners and augurs,\r\nfrom the field of medicine as a godless crew who are servants of the\r\ndevil. He cites the church fathers to show that all pagan divination\r\nis by demon aid. In the same chapter he disapproves of any use of\r\n“characters and superstitions” in medicine, and even forbids the use\r\nof the sign of the cross or Lord’s Prayer in collecting medicinal\r\nsimples.[2689]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Disapprobation of Sorcerers._]\r\n\r\nIn his _Libellus de improbatione maleficiorum_[2690] Arnald questions\r\nthe power of sorcerers or necromancers to invoke demons and compel\r\nthem to give responses or to work wonders. By adopting a very similar\r\nargumentation to that of the early fathers he arrives at the familiar\r\ntheological conclusion that men are purposely misled in these arts of\r\nsorcery and necromancy by the demons who have invented the fiction\r\nof an art and a procedure to cover their own iniquitous ends. Arnald\r\nis not concerned to emphasize this conclusion especially, however;\r\nhis object is rather simply to show that demons cannot naturally be\r\ncompelled by man to obey him. He argues that the human mind, which\r\nis joined to a body, is of inferior grade to separate or incorporeal\r\nsubstances and so cannot command them. He also holds that demons who\r\nare spiritual beings cannot be coerced by human use of natural objects\r\nsuch as gems or even by human use of the influence of the stars. He\r\ndenies that demons are distributed in any particular quarters of the\r\nheavens, or that they are subject to man at any particular hours of\r\nthe day. He denies that spirits can be coerced by the light of the\r\ncelestial bodies, asking, if this is so, why they are invoked at night\r\nand in darkness rather than at midday. He admits that it is the opinion\r\nof many that a spirit can be coerced by the special virtue of Saturn\r\nor of Jupiter or some other star; but he questions whether man can\r\nmaster this special virtue of a planet, “since no terrestrial substance\r\nnaturally governs a star, although some philosophers have said that\r\nthe human soul sometimes commands the nature of the elements.” He also\r\nraises the familiar objection that the invokers of spirits are usually\r\ninferior to other men in virtue and intelligence, whereas those who\r\nlead pure and rational lives should by rights be the ones to control\r\nthe influence of the stars, if any men can. Arnald further denies\r\nthat artificial figures and characters or words uttered by man can\r\noverpower demons, since these artificial products derive such virtues\r\nas they have from things of inferior nature or the stars or the human\r\nartificer, and he has already insisted that none of these can coerce\r\nspirits. He justly observes that to contend that necromancers can\r\ncontrol the demons through superior demons is “stupidly said” and begs\r\nthe question. He therefore concludes that God alone can control the\r\nevil spirits and that He would delegate His power, if at all, only to\r\nsaintly men and not to such wicked sinners as the invokers of demons\r\nare. The _Histoire Littéraire de la France_, in its brief account of\r\nthis treatise, says, “It goes without saying that Arnald does not think\r\nall sorceries purely imaginary; however, it should be stated that he\r\ntries to demonstrate that demons are less at the beck and call of\r\nsorcerers than is commonly thought, and that many so-called instances\r\nof sorcery are merely pathological cases.” This last has reference to\r\nthe close of the treatise where Arnald makes the commonplace medieval\r\nobservation that persons suffering from melancholy are to be humored in\r\ntheir delusions.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The devices of sorcerers.]\r\n\r\nThat Arnald did not regard all sorceries as purely imaginary is further\r\nindicated by the long list of remedies against them collected in his\r\n_Remedia contra maleficia_. All but one or two of the suggestions\r\nmade by Petrus Hispanus in the chapter on counteracting witchcraft\r\nand dispelling demons in the _Thesaurus pauperum_ are found again\r\nin Arnald’s treatise. He also adds others and prefaces his list of\r\ncures by a description of the devices employed by sorcerers to impede\r\nconjugal relations. The sorcerer usually secretes in the mattress\r\nor pillow of the nuptial bed such objects as the two halves of an\r\nacorn, granulated beans, written characters, the filth of a bat, or\r\nthe testicles of a live cock. Arnald recommends that such articles be\r\nsearched for and removed, or preferably taken to a priest; or that the\r\ncouple sleep in another bed or house.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Counter-magic against them.]\r\n\r\nIn the case of the divided acorn he more explicitly recognizes the\r\nvalidity of the sorcerer’s sympathetic magic by prescribing an equally\r\nmagical counter-ceremony. The husband and wife are each to take\r\none-half of the nut and place the two halves together, and, after\r\nan interval of six days, eat them. Apparently Arnald believes that\r\nhumans can be bewitched by use of natural substances and written\r\ncharacters, although in the other treatise he denied that demons could\r\nbe so invoked. But now he goes farther and lists natural antidotes and\r\npreventives against demons as well as sorcery. Thus keeping the heart\r\nof a vulture or certain herbs in the house is said to cause demons to\r\nflee, although we have heard him deny that demons can be attracted\r\nby natural substances. Less surprising is the use of the sign of the\r\ncross, of holy water, masses, and the writing of the Tetragrammaton\r\nand other names. Interesting rites for the protection of newly married\r\ncouples against witchcraft of unknown origin are suffumigations of the\r\nnuptial chamber with the gall of a certain fish, or the leaves and\r\nfruit of a bramble bush, or the pulverized tooth of a dead man.[2691]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Arnald’s works and the Inquisition again.]\r\n\r\nThe _Histoire Littéraire de la France_, remarking that this treatise\r\nby Arnald was forbidden later by the Spanish Inquisition, adds, “No\r\none will hold that decision against them” (_On ne leur reprochera pas\r\ncette décision_). But one wonders if the Inquisition also condemned the\r\n_Thesaurus pauperum_ of Pope John XXI, which we have seen contained\r\nmany of the same remedies against witchcraft. Only another proof that\r\ncensors never know what is in the books that they condemn! But perhaps\r\nthe medieval or papal inquisition would not have made such a slip.\r\nCertainly the Spanish Inquisition had grown very captious, if, as\r\nthe _Histoire Littéraire_ says, it also forbade Arnald’s treatise on\r\nastrological medicine and some alchemistic works ascribed to him.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Incantations.]\r\n\r\nArnald’s attitude in the matter of incantations is as inconsistent as\r\nhis position regarding the effect of natural substances on spirits.\r\nIn one passage of his _Breviarium_[2692] he condemns the incantations\r\nemployed in cases of childbirth by the old-wives of Salerno. Taking\r\nthree grains of pepper, the enchantress would say over each a Lord’s\r\nprayer, substituting for the words, “Deliver us from evil,” the\r\nrequest, “Deliver this woman from the pangs of childbirth.” Then she\r\nwould administer the grains one after another in wine or water so that\r\nthey should not touch the patient’s teeth, and finally she would repeat\r\nthrice in the patient’s ear this incantation, accompanied each time by\r\na _Paternoster_,\r\n\r\n    _Bizomie lamion lamium azerai vachina deus deus sabaoth,_\r\n    _Benedictus qui venit in nomine domini, osanna in excelsis._\r\n\r\nArnald declares that such diabolical practices should be shunned by\r\nall the faithful. Yet in the same treatise[2693] he tells of an almost\r\nidentical procedure by which a priest cured him of over a hundred warts\r\nwithin ten days. The priest touched the warts, made the sign of the\r\ncross, turned to a parietary and kneeling repeated the Lord’s prayer,\r\nsubstituting for the words, “Deliver us from evil,” the request,\r\n“Deliver Master Arnald from the wens and warts on his hands.” After\r\nwhich, instead of the three peppercorns he plucked the tips of three\r\nof the stalks of the parietary, at the same time repeating three\r\n_Paternosters_, and placed those three tips in the ground in a damp and\r\nsecluded spot. “And,” concludes Arnald, “when they began to wither,\r\nmy warts began to disappear.” It is true that the couplet of jargon,\r\nwhich perhaps Arnald regarded as alone diabolical, is omitted and that\r\na priest rather than a witch performed the rite, but the Lord’s prayer\r\nis still used as an incantation and the ceremony with the stalks is a\r\nclear case of magic transfer of disease and of sympathetic magic. In a\r\nthird passage of the same treatise[2694] Arnald suggests the following\r\n“good prayer” against quinsy, “Lord Jesus Christ, truly our God, by the\r\npower of thy name Jesus and by the prayer of thy servant Blasius,[2695]\r\ndeign to free A. thy servant.” The popularity of _The Breviary of\r\nPractice from head to soles of feet_, in which these passages occur is\r\nindicated by the fact that it had been printed three times during the\r\nlater fifteenth century before any complete edition of Arnald’s works\r\nhad been published.[2696]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Cures of old-wives.]\r\n\r\nArnald does not always speak ill of the cures of the old-wives. At\r\nRome he saw a poor woman cure quinsy sore-throat with a plaster of her\r\nown,[2697] and at Montpellier a good wife cured by some secret method a\r\nman who was threatened with death by a continuous hemorrhage.[2698]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ligatures and suspensions.]\r\n\r\nIt was not inappropriate that Arnald should have translated the\r\ntreatise of Costa ben Luca on _Incantations, Adjurations, and\r\nSuspension from the Neck_, or that at least that treatise should appear\r\namong his works, in view of the specimens of prayers and formulae which\r\nwe have just given and of the more numerous instances of ligatures\r\nand suspensions in his works which we shall next illustrate. In his\r\n_De parte operativa_ he says that there are plants, stones, and parts\r\nof animals which, if suspended about the neck or bound about the body\r\nor sewn into the clothing, produce impotency, a belief which his\r\n_Remedia contra maleficia_ have already illustrated. In his treatise on\r\nwines he states that coral suspended from the neck so that it touches\r\nthe abdomen prevents disturbances of the stomach. In his work on\r\nepilepsy[2699] among other suspensions he mentions some which he has\r\ntried with boys, the wood of certain trees bound with silver. Kings are\r\ntaught to suspend an emerald about their children’s necks as soon as\r\nthey are born as a protection against epilepsy, or the gem may be worn\r\nin a ring as an amulet against that disease. “Socrates recites this\r\nmarvelous experience,” of the two stones found in swallows’ gizzards\r\nand how one may be worn in skin as an amulet. In his _Treatment for\r\nGout_ Arnald tells how “some experimenters” bind a frog’s legs on the\r\npatient’s feet, right foot on right, and left on left; while “another\r\nphilosopher and experimenter” binds on the stone magnet, and still\r\nothers use the talon of an eagle or the foot of a tortoise.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Marvelous virtues in nature.]\r\n\r\nAs these ligatures and suspensions suggest, Arnald was a believer in\r\nmarvelous virtues in stones, plants, animals, and human beings, and\r\nhe discusses the general subject of occult virtue at some length. He\r\naccepts the notion that the magnet cannot attract iron in the presence\r\nof adamant.[2700] A way to discover whether an epileptic has been cured\r\nis to make him inhale smoke from burning horn of goat or pulverized\r\nagate; if not perfectly cured, he will straightway fall in a fit.[2701]\r\nFumigation of a villa or manor with a cow’s left horn keeps away\r\nlocusts.[2702] Arnald enlarges upon the great virtue of wine in which\r\na heated gold plate has been extinguished four or five times. Some\r\npersons merely hold a gold-piece in the mouth while drinking wine, but\r\nArnald deems it wiser to reduce the gold to potable form, although\r\nhe admits that there may be some efficacy in the other method, since\r\nmerely holding silver in the mouth quenches thirst and holding coral in\r\nthe mouth comforts the stomach.[2703]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Occult virtue defined.]\r\n\r\nIn the eighteenth chapter of his _Mirror of Introductions to Medicine_\r\nArnald defines occult virtue or _proprietas_, as he also calls it.\r\nBriefly it is a property which is not immediately perceptible to the\r\nsenses as are heat and cold, color, odor, and taste, and also one for\r\nwhich reason cannot account and whose existence cannot be learned by\r\nreasoned experiment but only by chance discovery. This is because such\r\noccult virtue depends on two things: the mixture of the elements in\r\nthe object possessing it and its “specific form.” But the ratio of\r\ncomponents in compounds “varies infinitely” and cannot be learned by\r\nreason, and the same is true of their “specific forms.” Nor can they\r\nbe discovered by rational experiment which requires some objective\r\nto aim at. Therefore the only way to discover the occult virtue of\r\nan object is to happen upon its manifestation by chance. Again in\r\nhis _Repetitio super Canon ‘Vita Brevis_’[2704] Arnald declares that\r\n“properties” cannot be learned by reason but only by experience or\r\nrevelation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Due to the stars.]\r\n\r\nSuch occult virtue, or at least the “specific form” upon which it\r\npartly depends, is ascribed by Arnald as usual to the influence of the\r\nstars. It is owing, for example, to “the specific influence of the\r\nheavens” that gold is “something arcane, most perfect in its equable\r\ntemperament, composed of a marvelous proportion of the virtues of the\r\nelements, and which has not its like among compounds.”[2705] The gold\r\nmade by alchemists may resemble it in color and substance but not in\r\nthis occult virtue. Arnald, indeed, holds what Aquinas and others\r\ndenied, that different individuals of the same species may be endowed\r\nby the stars with diverse properties.[2706] This is in his opinion the\r\nexplanation why one sapphire will harm and another cleanse the human\r\neye. “It leaps into the eye and is received in its bosom without injury\r\nand comes out loaded with foreign matter.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Astrological medicine.]\r\n\r\nFrom the occult virtue of terrestrial objects we are thus led as usual\r\nto the superior influence of the stars, which occupies a prominent, or\r\nbetter, fundamental place in Arnald’s works. He affirms that “since it\r\nis evident that God, the supreme artificer and begetter, has committed\r\nthe government of nature to the motions of the stars, their influence\r\nupon the human body is no slight one.”[2707] Or he cites Galen as\r\nsaying that philosophers assert that all things on earth are formed\r\nand fulfilled by the course and working of the heavenly bodies.[2708]\r\nThe hour of collecting medicines is often very important[2709] and\r\nthe physician should also know how the air about us is altered by the\r\nstars.[2710] Astrological medicine is also found in Arnald’s treatise\r\non preserving youth and retarding age,[2711] and in his _Judgments of\r\nInfirmities by the Motion of the Planets_, where he also associates the\r\nmembers of the human body with the signs of the zodiac. This he does\r\nfor the seven planets in his treatise on epilepsy.[2712]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Bleeding and the moon.]\r\n\r\nArnald alludes a number of times to the practice of bleeding\r\naccording to the phases of the moon. In his _Regulation of Health_\r\nhe discusses how the age of the moon and its location, conjunctions,\r\nand aspects must be taken into account.[2713] In his _General Rules\r\nfor the Cure of Disease_[2714] he says that the influence of the\r\nmoon should be regarded by physicians in their pharmacy as well as\r\ntheir blood-letting, as anyone who operates long and intelligently\r\nwill find by experience. Astrological authors prove it, but medical\r\nauthors generally remain silent on this point. Arnald finds support,\r\nhowever, in Galen’s _Critical Days_ and other works, and in the\r\nmore recent works of Gilbert of England, who cautions to observe\r\nthe moon in bleeding and advises against blood-letting in dog-days\r\nor on Egyptian days. Arnald would also include cauterization, other\r\nsurgical operations, and the administration of drugs, and there is much\r\nobservance of dog-days in his _Treatise against the stone_. On the\r\nother hand, Arnald rejects as false and worthless the statement in the\r\n_Regimen Salernitanum_ that the months of April, May, and September are\r\nlunar and that in them are the days on which bleeding is prohibited.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Bernard Gordon’s personal experience.]\r\n\r\nBernard Gordon, a medical contemporary of Arnald, notes in his\r\n_Phlebotomy_, written in 1307, that wise astronomers agree that\r\nbleeding should not be practiced when the moon is in Gemini, because\r\nat that time the vein will not give blood or it will open again or the\r\npatient will die. He goes on to narrate, however, that once having\r\nmade all preparations to bleed himself, it suddenly occurred to him\r\nthat the moon was then in Gemini. He persisted with the operation,\r\nhowever, which would seem to indicate that he did not really believe\r\nthat it would prove disastrous; and he records that as a matter of\r\nfact that particular bleeding did him more good than any other one\r\nhe ever underwent. Yet as the _Histoire Littéraire_ notes,[2715] he\r\nreproduced the opinion of the astronomers without comment in his\r\n_Prognostications_. Which suggests that clergy who practiced in private\r\narts of divination which they condemned in their writings were not the\r\nonly ones whose preaching and practice might be divergent; Bernard\r\ndefies astrological medicine successfully in personal practice but he\r\ncontinues to preach it in his writings. But to return to Arnald.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Operative astrology or magic.]\r\n\r\nArnald believes that a human operator can accomplish great things by\r\navailing himself of the influences of the stars, an idea which he\r\ndevelops especially in the treatise entitled, _De parte operativa_.\r\nIn the first place, there is the negative consideration that the\r\nforce which pours forth unceasingly from the stars is not absorbed\r\nunless bodies are in a condition to receive it, and that they may be\r\nput into such a favorable condition by art as well as by nature. More\r\npositively, everything produced by art or nature receives from the\r\nsky some property of acting upon other bodies or of being acted upon\r\nby them. So any man who knows the influences of the stars and how\r\nto prepare objects to receive them, can produce great and marvelous\r\nchanges in inferior things. Arnald thinks that “the juggleries of the\r\nmagicians and the illusions of the enchanters” and the operations\r\nof sorcerers and those who fascinate, have efficacy in no other\r\nway, except of course as demons may lend their aid. In other words,\r\nastrology is the basis of magic.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Seals or images.]\r\n\r\nArnald speaks particularly of gems to which either Nature, the\r\nmarvel-worker, or some erudite artist has given efficacious powers by\r\nengraving them with images in accordance with the constellations.[2716]\r\nIn his medical works he states that a lion on a lead seal prevents one\r\nfrom feeling pain in an operation for the stone,[2717] and that an\r\nimage of a man holding a dead serpent in his right hand and its tail\r\nin his left hand is an antidote for poison.[2718] That Arnald also\r\nemployed such methods in actual medical practice is shown from the\r\nfact that Pope Boniface VIII set great store by a seal in the form of\r\na lion which Arnald had prepared for him when he was suffering from\r\nthe stone.[2719] Arnald’s separate treatise on seals gives detailed\r\ndirections for engraving one for each sign of the zodiac. The following\r\nexample is typical of the others and also further illustrates Arnald’s\r\npropensity to pious incantations: “In the name of the living Father\r\nof our Lord Jesus Christ, take the purest gold and melt it as the sun\r\nenters Aries. Later form a round seal from it and say while so doing,\r\n‘Arise, Jesus, light of the world, thou who art in truth the lamb that\r\ntaketh away the sins of the world and enlighteneth our darkness.’ And\r\nrepeat the Psalm, _Domine dominus noster_. After doing this much, put\r\nthe seal away, and later, when the moon is in Cancer or Leo and while\r\nthe sun is in Aries, engrave on one side the figure of a ram and on\r\nthe circumference _arahel tribus juda v et vii_, and elsewhere on the\r\ncircumference let these sacred words be engraved, ‘The Word was made\r\nflesh and dwelt among us,’ and in the center, ‘Alpha and Omega and\r\nSaint Peter.’” These instructions are perhaps some relic of gnosticism.\r\nArnald then states the virtues and powers of the seal: “Moreover, this\r\nprecious seal works against all demons and capital enemies and against\r\nwitchcraft, and is efficacious in winning gain and favor, and aids in\r\nall dangers and financial difficulties (_vectigalibus_), and against\r\nthunderbolts and storms and inundations, and against the force of the\r\nwinds and the pestilences of the air. Its bearer is honored and feared\r\nin all his affairs. No harm can befall the building or occupants of\r\nthe house where it is. It benefits demoniacs, those suffering from\r\ninflammation of the brain, maniacs, quinsy sore throat, and all\r\ndiseases of the head and eyes, and those in which rheum descends from\r\nthe head. And in general I say that it wards off all evils and confers\r\ngoods; and let its bearer abstain as far as possible from impurity and\r\nluxury and other mortal sins, and let him wear it on his head with\r\nreverence and honor.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Experimental method.]\r\n\r\nArnald’s pages have supplied some evidence of the continued vogue of\r\nthat “experimental knowledge” and “experimental science” of which\r\nAlbertus Magnus and Roger Bacon and others of the early thirteenth\r\ncentury wrote. In a passage not yet noted[2720] Arnald recognizes\r\nthe difficulty of medical experimentation and, like Petrus Hispanus\r\nand John of St. Amand, makes some suggestions as to how it should be\r\nconducted. They are, however, not novel. We have also heard him speak\r\nof experimenters, of a “philosopher and experimenter,” of “the long\r\nexperience of any intelligent operator”, and of “rational experiment”\r\nwhich “always presupposes a determined object.” We have also heard him\r\nadmit that the occult virtues of natural objects can be hit upon only\r\nby chance experiment or by some sort of revelation. And since these\r\nlast two channels are as open to the common people as to the learned,\r\nit is possible that knowledge of occult virtues should be attained\r\nsooner by uneducated men than by others.[2721] This is not necessarily\r\nthe case, however, and in a third treatise he speaks of a truth\r\nhaving been verified by experience until it has come to the notice of\r\nilliterate men and women. This truth is that the weakened powers of\r\nage can to some extent be restored, and as a proof of this assertion\r\nArnald presently adduces the invention of eye-glasses,[2722] which are\r\nlikewise mentioned by his contemporary, Bernard Gordon.[2723] We\r\nalso have observed in Arnald the usual inclination to base marvels upon\r\nexperience, as in “the marvelous and elect experiment” of Socrates or\r\nthe cure of gout by binding on frog’s legs.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Further foibles of Arnald’s medicine.]\r\n\r\nIn conclusion some foibles of Arnald’s medicine may be noted which do\r\nnot exactly fall under any of the preceding heads. In the treatment\r\nof mania in the _Breviarium_ he advises as a last resort that the\r\nskin be cut in the form of a cross and the skull perforated so that\r\nthe noxious vapors may escape from the brain.[2724] In another place\r\nhe warns against washing the head too often, “since thereby many have\r\nlost their sight before their time.”[2725] He advises to lave the\r\neyes not with cold but with tepid water, and recommends as especially\r\nbeneficial to the eyes washing with one’s own urine when one rises from\r\nbed in the morning, or with one’s own saliva. Throughout this same\r\nwork he repeatedly recommends the most awful concoctions as remedies,\r\nbut perhaps the climax in the way of a series of complicated recipes\r\noccurs in his _Treatise against the Stone_,[2726] a disease for which\r\nhe had treated the pope. In his collection of antidotes[2727] we again\r\nrun across the Potion of St. Paul and the opiates supposed to have been\r\ndiscovered by the emperor Hadrian and the prophet Esdras.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The affair of Bernard Délicieux.]\r\n\r\nThe trial of Bernard Délicieux[2728] before the inquisition should\r\nperhaps be mentioned at this point as a connecting link between Arnald\r\nof Villanova of whom we have just treated and Raymond Lull to whom\r\nthe next chapter will be devoted, especially as the tendency of this\r\naffair would appear to be to bring both of them into disrepute with the\r\ninquisition and under suspicion of magic. Thus two citizens of Albi\r\ntestified that on the eve of Benedict XI’s death Bernard Délicieux or\r\nDelitiosi sent a leather chest wrapped in waxed cloth to Arnald of\r\nVillanova at the papal court, the imputation being that Arnald helped\r\nBernard to poison the pope. Furthermore, Bernard was found to have\r\nin his possession a book of nigromancy which he said Raymond Lull, a\r\nCatalan of Majorca, had given to him at Rome. No doubt this evidence\r\nagainst Raymond and Arnald is very flimsy; Bernard himself was freed of\r\nthe charge of poisoning;[2729] still, it may have done them some harm.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[2668] Jean Astruc, _Mémoires pour servir à l’histoire de la Faculté de\r\nMédecine de Montpellier_, Paris, 1767.

A similar passage in a work\r\ncontemporary with Arnald, Bernard Gordon’s _Tractatus de decem ingeniis\r\ncurandorum morborum_, pp. 228-9 of the Venice, 1496, edition, reads:\r\n“Tertio quod medicus operatur secundum artem seu per canones Galenis\r\net Hippocratis et aliorum sapientium et in hoc condemnatur omnis ars\r\nauguriandi sicut est ars geomantica et suspendendi herbas ad collum et\r\nomnia emperica et forticinia et fassina et alia quam plurima quae non\r\nest bonum revelare propter abutentes qui conscientia neglecta utuntur\r\nmagis et quibusdam ingeniis fatuis et cum omni sollertia pessima et\r\nmala lege et multa similia quae non sunt tunc narrabilia....

At the close of his “ninth experiment” for the eyes, a\r\nformidable mixture, he says, “et est tantae virtutis quod decrepitum\r\nfaceret legere litteras minutas sine ocularibus.” Magnifying lenses\r\nhave of course been mentioned earlier by Grosseteste; see above p. 441.\r\n\r\nBernard Gordon also mentions “experimenters,” _Lilium_ V, 12, fol. 159,\r\n“et dicunt experimentatores.”\r\n\r\n[2724] _Breviarium_, I, 26.\r\n\r\n[2725] _Ibid._, I, 13.\r\n\r\n[2726] _Tractatus contra calculum._\r\n\r\n[2727] _Antidotarium._\r\n\r\n[2728] HL 29, 276; Lea, _Hist. of Inquisition of Middle Ages_\r\n(1888) III, 452; but especially B.

This combination was characteristic\r\nof him and he has been charged with holding that all the mysteries of\r\nthe Faith could be proved and comprehended by reason and with “removing\r\nall distinction between natural and supernatural truth.”[2732] His\r\nchief contribution to learning was the method of his Art, of which\r\nmore presently. But he was a voluminous writer upon a great variety\r\nof themes, some of which border more closely on the field of our\r\ninvestigation. Some of these works at first sight may seem to have\r\nlittle connection with what appears to have been Lull’s main object in\r\nlife, namely, the conversion of the Mohammedan world and the rescue of\r\nthe holy sepulcher.[2733] But his crusading and missionary methods were\r\nsomewhat peculiar, involving not only a long preparatory educational\r\nperiod, especially in the study of oriental languages, but also the\r\nrefutation of Arabian philosophy, particularly that of Averroes, and\r\ntoward that goal the conciliation of philosophy and theology in the\r\nChristian world. In 1276 he persuaded the king of Aragon to establish a\r\nschool for the study of Arabic in Majorca, and in 1311 at the Council\r\nof Vienne he persuaded the pope to authorize chairs in Greek, Hebrew,\r\nChaldean and Arabic at Rome, Paris, Oxford, Bologna, and Salamanca. He\r\nfailed, however, in his effort at this council to obtain a prohibition\r\nof Averroistic teaching in Christian universities. Lull himself,\r\nbesides teaching in his own school in Majorca, lectured on his Art\r\nat Paris, Montpellier and elsewhere. But he also was an active field\r\nmissionary, converting Saracens not only in the Balearic Isles but also\r\nin Cyprus and Armenia, while he went three times to North Africa. On\r\nthe first occasion he was imprisoned and then banished, on the last he\r\nwas stoned to death. This martyrdom, added to his fame as a poet and\r\nscholar, has made him the national saint of the Balearic Isles, but\r\nhe actually has only been beatified and not canonized. He appears to\r\nhave been a member of the third order of St. Francis. His will, drawn\r\nup in 1313 and brought again to light in 1896, shows that he had\r\nchildren.[2734] His death occurred on the 29th of June, 1315.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Orthodoxy questioned.]\r\n\r\nThe chief reason why Lull has never been canonized is the doubt that\r\nhas prevailed as to his complete orthodoxy, a matter more than once\r\nquestioned. Eymeric (1320-1399) when Inquisitor-General of Aragon\r\nattacked the doctrines of Lull, listing five hundred passages in his\r\nworks as heretical and claiming that Gregory XI had condemned two\r\nhundred in a bull of 1376,--which has not been found. It is thought\r\nthat the bull meant is one against a converted Jew, Raymond of Tárrega\r\nwho had turned renegade and written works on magic. At any rate in\r\n1386 another inquisitor at Barcelona cleared the views of Lull from\r\nsuspicion. The University of Majorca established by King Ferdinand\r\nthe Catholic became a great center of Lullism. Then in the middle\r\nof the sixteenth century Lull’s works were placed on the _Index\r\nExpurgatorius_, but were removed before the close of the century. It\r\nmay seem strange that the relations between Lullism and the Inquisition\r\nand Index were not more cordial, since they are often both represented\r\nas pursuing the same quarry, Averroism, of which we are told, “Lullism\r\nalways provided its strongest foes.”[2735] But we rather suspect that\r\n“Averroism” was in the nature of an air-drawn phantom whose assailants\r\nwere apt to injure one another.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: His natural science not unusual.]\r\n\r\nProbst regards Lull as in advance of his age in his use of observation\r\nand experimental science and his knowledge that the world was round\r\nand acquaintance with the mariner’s compass.[2736] This knowledge,\r\nhowever, he really shared with his times and we can scarcely regard him\r\nas a precursor of Columbus nor even quite as an equal of Roger Bacon\r\nin these respects, exaggerated as we believe the estimates to be which\r\nhave often been made of Roger’s importance. But Probst shows a similar\r\ntendency to exaggerate the scientific importance of Lull at the expense\r\nof his period.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: His Art Universal.]\r\n\r\nLull’s chief original contribution to medieval learning bore scant\r\nrelation indeed to the methods of observation and experiment. His\r\nfamous Art came to him as a sudden inspiration in the midst of long\r\nstudy and reflection and was, he and his followers believed, received\r\nby direct divine illumination. Hence his title, “the illuminated\r\nDoctor.” In reality the method of his Art leads us to infer that it\r\noccurred to him by some process of sub-conscious association with the\r\nemployment of the planisphere in astronomy or the use of a revolving\r\nwheel and tables of combinations of letters of the alphabet such as\r\nwe have noted in the geomancies and modes of divination ascribed to\r\nSocrates, Pythagoras, and other philosophers. Lull’s idea seems to\r\nhave been the invention of a logical machine which would constitute\r\nthe same sort of labor-saving device in a scholastic disputation or\r\nmedieval university as an adding machine in a modern bank or business\r\noffice. By properly arranging categories and concepts, subjects and\r\npredicates in the first place, one could get the correct answer to such\r\npropositions as might be put. Another advantage of this method would\r\nbe that a sceptical Arab, who might refuse to listen to or view with\r\nsuspicion the verbal arguments of a missionary, would be irresistibly\r\nconvinced of the truth of the doctrines of Christianity by this\r\nmachine, or at least mechanical method, which would impress him as\r\nimpartial and reliable Lull’s diagrams and mechanical devices included\r\na tree, intersecting triangles, and concentric circles divided into\r\ncompartments, of which one rotated something like the planet; in the\r\nsigns while the other remained stationary like the sphere of the fixed\r\nstars.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Circular figures employed in theology.]\r\n\r\nIn questions of theology a circle was employed whose center stood\r\nfor God while its circumference divided into sixteen “chambers”\r\nrepresenting kindness, grandeur, eternity, power, wisdom, will, virtue,\r\ntruth, glory, perfection, justice, beneficence, pity, humility,\r\ndominion, and patience. One hundred and twenty more “chambers” were\r\nformed by combining pairs of the foregoing. Another circle shows\r\nthe rational soul in the center represented by four squares and has\r\nits circumference divided into sixteen compartments representing\r\nappropriate qualities. A third circle, devoted to principles and\r\nmeanings, enclosed five triangles in a circumference of fifteen\r\ncompartments; while a fourth circle divided fourteen compartments\r\nof its circumference between the seven virtues and seven vices\r\nrespectively rendered in blue and red. Other “figures” dealt with\r\npredestination, fate, and free-will, truth, and falsity. The following\r\nis a specific instance of the way in which these were combined.\r\nWhen the rational soul is troubled and uncertain in the circle of\r\npredestination, because the chambers of ignorance and merit, science\r\nand fault, mingle together, it forms a third figure representing doubt.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Figure of a tree used in medicine.]\r\n\r\nIn medicine the figure of a tree was employed. At its roots a wheel\r\ndivided into quarters signifying bile, blood, phlegm, and atrabile.\r\nThe tree had two trunks, on one of which bloomed the principles of\r\nancient medicine. Its first branch, the natural, bore seven flowers:\r\nthe elements, complexions, humors, members, faculties, operations, and\r\nspirits; and four figures dependent on these, namely, ages, colors,\r\nshapes, and sexes. The second non-natural branch produced six flowers:\r\nair, exercise, food and drink, sleep and activity, emptiness and\r\nsurfeit, and the accidents of the mind. The third bough, or contrary\r\nto nature, had three flowers: disease and its causes and results. The\r\nother main trunk had two boughs. One divided into hot and cold, moist\r\nand dry, and the four degrees of each. The other bore three triangles\r\nand a square. The red triangle represented the source, the middle,\r\nand the end; the green triangle stood for difference, agreement, and\r\ncontrariety; the yellow triangle comprised majority, minority, and\r\nequality.[2737] The square divides into four colors: red for being;\r\nblack for privation; blue for perfection; green for imperfection.[2738]\r\nSuch are some of the diagrams of the Lullian art, intended presumably\r\nto be worked by cranks or levers. There is really nothing magical about\r\nthem; they are purely mechanical and representative and illustrative.\r\nBut in their make-up they are certainly suggestive of a Gnostic or\r\nOphite diagram or of a geomantic wheel, and possibly may sometimes have\r\nbeen suspected of being magical by outsiders.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Lull and alchemy.]\r\n\r\nThe use of the word “Art” for this logical machinery and graphic\r\nmethod of Raymond Lull perhaps also led to the notion that he was an\r\nalchemist and exponent of the Hermetic art. Various works of alchemy\r\nwere ascribed to him but are regarded as spurious; perhaps some of\r\nthem are by the Jew, Raymond of Tárrega, already mentioned. No work of\r\nalchemy is mentioned in the lists of his writings drawn up in 1311 and\r\n1314,[2739] and the sixth part, devoted to metals, of his _Libre de\r\nles Maravels_ is unfavorable to alchemy.[2740] In his Latin _Questions\r\nSoluble by the Demonstrative or Inventive Art_ he again adduced\r\nreasons against transmutation.[2741] De Luanco has collected other\r\npassages from Raymond’s undisputed works unfavorable to alchemy and the\r\nalchemists.[2742] We have seen, however, that a writer may criticize\r\nmost or all other alchemists sharply and question various doctrines\r\nand methods of alchemy and yet have his own way of getting around the\r\ndifficulties whether theoretical, such as the permanence of species,\r\nor practical. There is therefore something to be said for the position\r\nof Barber who, while recognizing that the treatises current under\r\nRaymond’s name are spurious, adds, “We can well believe that he wrote\r\nas well as thought on alchemy.”[2743] And it was Berthelot’s opinion\r\nthat while the works ascribed to Raymond are spurious, “nevertheless\r\nit is incontestable that those writings were composed by persons who\r\nbelieved themselves his disciples.”[2744] These spurious works were in\r\nexistence at an early date and Raymond is cited as an alchemist from\r\nthe fourteenth century on.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: His attitude to astrology.]\r\n\r\nIf Lull was an opponent of the art of transmuting metals rather than\r\nan adept in alchemy, he was at least a believer in astrology as\r\nseveral of his works show. It is true, and this is the more important\r\nto note as suggesting how Lull’s utterances on the subject of alchemy\r\nmay also have been misunderstood, that the _Histoire Littéraire de\r\nla France_, in describing Raymond’s _Tractatus novus de astronomia_,\r\nwritten in 1297, gives the impression that it is directed against\r\nastrology, stating that Lull says that he has written it “to dissuade\r\nprinces and magnates from trusting in the divinations of astrologers,”\r\nand adding, “Less worthy of praise is the second part of the work\r\nwhere the author assumes to apply to astronomy the principles of\r\nhis art universal.”[2745] An examination of the treatise itself in\r\nmanuscript[2746] shows that it is only of certain astrologers and\r\ndiviners who deceive princes by false judgments from the stars that\r\nRaymond would have royalty beware. He writes his book not because\r\n“astronomy” (i.e. astrology) is false but because it is so difficult\r\nthat often judgments made by the art turn out false, and because he\r\nwishes to investigate and discover new methods by which men can have\r\ngreater knowledge of “astronomy” and its judgments. When he comes to\r\nspeak of the properties of each planet, he remarks that “astronomers”\r\nattribute many properties to Saturn but do not prove them. He intends\r\nto employ his Art in investigating Saturn’s properties, and comes\r\nto the conclusion that men born under that planet are, among other\r\ntraits, ponderously grave, suspicious by nature, disposed to toil and\r\nto build great edifices, and ambitious to hold office.[2747] Later on\r\nwe find him spending many pages in listing different combinations of\r\nthe planets in the signs as fortunate or unfortunate.[2748] All this,\r\nof course, is judicial astrology rather than astronomy. He “proves”\r\nalso that the sky is animated by a moving and circular soul or spirit,\r\nand he states that “astronomers” recognize in their judgments that\r\nthis soul of the sky is the cause of things caused in our inferior\r\nworld.[2749] After a while, however, he does reprove “the philosophers\r\nwho invented the science of astronomy” for “certain points in this\r\nscience in which they have erred,” namely, in making it necessary and\r\ninevitable. Lull holds that God can alter nature as the smith alters\r\nthe direction of his falling hammer, and that the human mind has free\r\nwill to resist the influence of the stars.[2750] But this criticism\r\nof astrology is neither novel nor entirely justified. Lull never\r\ndisputes but always accepts the theory that the heavenly bodies shed\r\ntheir influence and virtue upon inferiors. He does, however, speak\r\nslightingly of the art of geomancy and its practitioners.[2751]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: To the condemnation of 1277 at Paris.]\r\n\r\nIn the same year 1297 in which Raymond wrote the treatise just\r\nsummarized he also published an imaginary dialogue dealing with the\r\n219 opinions which had been condemned at Paris in 1277.[2752] In this\r\ndialogue “Socrates” undertakes the defense of philosophy while Raymond\r\nsupports theology and the articles of condemnation. We have seen that\r\na number of the opinions condemned were astrological in character.\r\nRaymond does not join in active condemnation of all of these, passing\r\nover a number in silence and perhaps intentionally evading them. On\r\narticle 30, “that superior intelligences create rational souls without\r\nthe motion of the sky; but that inferior intelligences create the\r\nvegetative and sensitive souls by means of the motion of the sky,”\r\nRaymond’s comment is that creation is the proper function of God. To\r\nSocrates’ repetition of the sixty-first article, “that God can do\r\ncontrary things, that is, by means of a celestial body which is diverse\r\nin its whereabouts,” Raymond replies that God can act directly and\r\nproduce contraries without the intervention of any heavenly body, if He\r\nwishes to, as He did in creating the four elements with their contrary\r\nqualities of hot and cold, dry and moist. Raymond adds, however, that\r\nGod would not produce sins, since He is perfect in goodness. In reply\r\nto articles 92 and 102, that the heavenly bodies are moved by a soul\r\nand by appetitive virtue just like an animal, and that the soul of the\r\nsky is intelligence, Raymond answers that in his opinion it is correct\r\nto say that the sky has a motive soul but not a vegetative or sensitive\r\nor imaginative or rational soul. “If, however, I am not speaking the\r\ntruth in this, I am prepared to receive correction; but I believe that\r\nI am speaking truly.” Raymond also upholds human free will as in the\r\npreceding treatise. The close of the present dialogue is, at least\r\non the surface, an edifying instance of submission to ecclesiastical\r\nauthority. Socrates asks Raymond if the theologians believe as he has\r\nbeen saying. Raymond replies that he believes so, since he has proved\r\nhis own statements and believes them to be true, and he knows that\r\nthe venerable lords and doctors of theology who are pillars of the\r\nChristian Faith believe only what is true. If, however, he has erred,\r\nit is unwittingly and unintentionally, and he humbly supplicates those\r\nmost powerful masters to correct the words of their weak servant.\r\nSocrates chimes in that he has merely been repeating for his part what\r\nthe ancient philosophers said, but that if any of it is contrary to\r\nChristianity, he does not want to believe it. He therefore proposes\r\nthat they go to Paris and submit the book to the theologians there for\r\ntheir approval or correction, as his desire is to see “great concord\r\nbetween my lords the masters in theology and in philosophy.” It seems\r\nevident that behind his humble tone Lull is trying to soften down\r\nthe condemnation of 1277 and substitute a somewhat more conciliatory\r\nattitude.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The book of Raymond on medicine and astronomy.]\r\n\r\nLull’s attitude to astrology is further illustrated by a treatise in\r\nwhich he applies the method of his Art universal to the subject of\r\nastrological medicine.[2753] “Since the science of medicine is very\r\ndifficult on account of its principles being so secret,” Raymond\r\nproposes to investigate them by means of his Art. His treatise has\r\nthree divisions: the first, concerning the inferior world of the\r\nelements and the body of the human patient; the second, concerning\r\nthe regions of the celestial bodies; and the third, consisting of\r\nquestions. Raymond denotes the four elements by the letters from a to\r\nd, and the combinations of heat or cold with humidity and drought by\r\nthe letters from e to h. He then introduces a figure with two circles\r\nrepresenting the eighth sphere and the zodiac, since the motion of\r\nthe planets controls that of the human body. These two circles are\r\neach divided into eight “houses,” which correspond to sixteen pairs of\r\nletters consisting of each of the four elements joined with each of the\r\nfour letters denoting pairs of qualities, namely, ae, af, ag, ah, be,\r\nbf, bg, bh, ce, cf, cg, ch, de, df, dg, and dh. Raymond then discusses\r\nsuch topics as fevers, the pulse, evacuation, diet, bleeding, bathing,\r\nthe color of the urine, digestion and indigestion, pains, appetite,\r\nand the method of grading medicines. The relation of his letters and\r\n“houses” to these matters may be seen from his statement that the house\r\nof _ae_ causes one kind of appetite, that of _be_ another, and so\r\non. Coming to the second section of his treatise, Lull treats of the\r\nplanets and signs and relates the conjunctions of the various planets\r\nwith one another to his eight letters and their combinations. In the\r\nthird part he puts illustrative problems and solves them by reference\r\nto his preceding text.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: An uncomplimentary allusion to thirteenth century medicine.]\r\n\r\nWe might think Lull an opponent of medicine, if we attended only to\r\na passage in his _Contemplation of God_.[2754] Here he complains\r\nthat doctors of the body are more sought after, better paid, more\r\nscrupulously obeyed than are physicians of the soul. They go well clad\r\non good steeds, and amass wealth by working all sorts of impositions\r\nupon their patients, boasting of their knowledge of diseases of which\r\nthey are really ignorant, prolonging the period of illness in order\r\nto increase their pay, and prescribing syrups and the like in large\r\nquantities because they share in the profits of the apothecaries.\r\nThey try out potions on their patients which they would never take\r\nthemselves, and there is no other art in the world so risky and over\r\nwhich there is so much disagreement. These remarks of Raymond are,\r\nhowever, the sort of satirical observations on medical practice that\r\nmight be made at almost any period, so that it is difficult to tell if\r\nthey are especially applicable to the thirteenth century.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Necromancy and divine names.]\r\n\r\nIn closing we may note two brief indications of Lull’s belief in two\r\nother occult subjects, namely, necromancy and the power of divine\r\nnames. Of necromancy he of course did not approve but in the treatise\r\njust cited he adduces the art of necromancy as evidence for the\r\nexistence of God, since it requires the services of demons and they\r\nare no other beings than fallen angels who owe their existence to\r\nGod.[2755] This somewhat tortuous theistic argument we have already\r\nheard advanced by Justin Martyr. In his treatise in Catalan on _The\r\nHundred Names of God_ Raymond asks, “Since God has put virtues in\r\nwords, plants, and stones, how will He not have put far greater virtue\r\ninto His names?”[2756]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[2730] A number of works on Lull have appeared recently: M.

Of his\r\nwritings in medicine, philosophy, and astronomy many are extant, and\r\nmost of these in printed editions. Yet he has never been adequately\r\nor accurately treated in English. In our language there have merely\r\nbeen brief notices of or incidental references to him in histories\r\nof science and medicine, or of the inquisition and of rationalism in\r\nEurope, or in general encyclopedias. Such passages and parallel ones\r\nin foreign languages[2757] often give dates of Peter’s life or death\r\nincorrectly, or do injustice to his opinions from an insufficient or\r\nvery indirect knowledge of his works, or represent him as a victim of\r\nthe Inquisition and an example of the hostility of the medieval church\r\nto science to an extent which the sources do not justify. There are,\r\nhowever, in European languages, especially Italian, some secondary\r\nstudies of importance concerning Peter. It is upon these and a direct\r\nexamination of his works that the present chapter will be based. To\r\navoid prolixity of text and footnotes, details of bibliography[2758]\r\nand a number of problems concerning his life which require to be\r\ndiscussed at some length have been transferred to appendices at the\r\nclose of the chapter. In the present text, since most of Peter’s\r\nworks can be dated rather exactly and since they were among the chief\r\nevents of his life, we may combine biography and bibliography in large\r\nmeasure. We shall then treat somewhat, although by no means adequately,\r\nof his place in the history of science, and finally of his propensities\r\ntoward astrology and other varieties of magic.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Birth and family.]\r\n\r\nPeter’s own statements in his chief work, the _Conciliator_,[2759]\r\nshow that he wrote it in the year 1303, after having worked it over\r\nin class-room lectures and discussions for ten years previously, and\r\nthat he was fifty-three years of age at that time. In other words,\r\nhe was born in 1250. On one point of his biography more precise and\r\nscientific detail is forthcoming than is customary in the lives of the\r\ngreat men of the past, for he confides exactly how long a time elapsed\r\nbefore his birth, nine months and fourteen days, as he had learned by\r\nastrological scrutiny and from his “most careful mother.”[2760] In his\r\nwill Peter gives his father’s name as Constantius of Abano,[2761] and\r\nhe was probably the notary of that name whose tombstone inscription has\r\nbeen preserved.[2762] Scardeone stated that Peter had one son named\r\nBenvenuto,[2763] whose name also appears in a list of inhabitants\r\nof Padua in 1320[2764] and who took part in a street fight there in\r\n1325.[2765] Gloria was the first to call attention to two other sons,\r\nnamed Pietro and Zuffredo, whose names appear together with their\r\nbrother’s in deeds of sale and of inheritance of November 19, 1318,\r\nand February 2, 1321. Gloria was of the opinion that these sons were\r\nillegitimate, and Peter’s failure to make them his heirs in his will\r\nmay perhaps be so interpreted, but they are not called natural sons in\r\nthe documents.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Travels abroad.]\r\n\r\nAt some time of unknown date Peter was in Sardinia, where he says\r\nhe saw a case of poisoning from “Pharaoh’s fig,”[2766] and at\r\nConstantinople, where he discovered a volume of the _Problems_ of\r\nAristotle, which he translated into Latin for the first time. It was\r\nprobably there too that he saw a Greek version of Dioscorides arranged\r\nalphabetically--his own edition of Dioscorides follows another text,\r\nthe medieval Latin version--and secured the works of Galen and other\r\ntreatises which Michael Savonarola[2767] says that he translated from\r\nGreek into Latin. Peter is also said to have visited Spain, England,\r\nand Scotland, but I have found no proof of this, although allusions to\r\nsuch visits may possibly occur somewhere in his voluminous works.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: At Paris.]\r\n\r\nA number of years of Peter’s life were spent at the University of\r\nParis, where Michael Savonarola states that he was regarded as a second\r\nAristotle and called “the great Lombard.” There he wrote his work on\r\nPhysiognomy (_liber compilationis phisonomie_) which he dedicated to\r\nBordelone Bonacossi who was captain-general of Mantua from 1292 to\r\n1299. In the version which has reached us and which is dated 1295 Peter\r\nalludes to an earlier draft which had gone astray and had failed to\r\nreach its destination in Italy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: His Latin version of Abraham Aben Ezra.]\r\n\r\nIn 1293 Peter found astrological writings of the Jew, Abraham Aben\r\nEzra, who had flourished at Toledo in the twelfth century, defectively\r\ntranslated from Hebrew into French,[2768] and therefore published a\r\nLatin revision of his own, apparently also adding treatises which had\r\nnot been included in the previous translation.[2769] This raises the\r\nquestion whether Peter was acquainted with Hebrew and Arabic,[2770]\r\nor whether he may have used a Greek version of Abraham’s treatises\r\nin correcting the French one. At any rate Peter’s Latin version of\r\nAbraham’s astrological works had a widespread influence, as it was\r\nretranslated into various European vernaculars and apparently even back\r\nagain into Arabic.[2771]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Conversation with Marco Polo.]\r\n\r\nPeter talked with the famous oriental traveler, Marco Polo, at some\r\ntime between the latter’s return to Venice in 1295 and the completion\r\nof the _Conciliator_, in which he cites Marco’s statements to him\r\nconcerning tropical countries near the equator.[2772]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Translations from the Greek.]\r\n\r\nA translation of the Problems of _Alexander medicus_ is ascribed to\r\nPeter in the list of his works in a fifteenth century manuscript.[2773]\r\nThis can hardly refer to Alexander of Tralles. Perhaps what is meant is\r\na translation of the Problems of Alexander of Aphrodisias, of which I\r\nknow only one manuscript where it is dated 1302. Savonarola, however,\r\nstates that Peter translated the Aphorisms of Alexander and also the\r\nRhetoric of Aristotle, but the latter translation does not seem to be\r\nextant. Some at least of Peter’s translations of Galen’s works would\r\nappear to have been executed before 1303, since they are referred to\r\nby him in the _Conciliator_. Also two of them are found in manuscripts\r\ndated as early as 1304 and 1305, the latter containing Peter’s\r\ncompletion of the translation of Galen’s _Therapeutic Method_ begun by\r\nBurgundio of Pisa.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Did he teach at Bologna?]\r\n\r\nThis last manuscript was written at Bologna in 1305 and is about the\r\nonly evidence we have to support the old tradition, which was already\r\nquestioned by Mazzuchelli, that Peter taught at Bologna.[2774]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Return to Padua.]\r\n\r\nSavonarola seems correct in stating that Peter completed the\r\n_Conciliator_ and began the composition of his Commentary on the\r\nProblems of Aristotle at Paris, and the _Explicit_ of the latter work\r\nlikewise states that Peter wrote part of it in Paris and finished it\r\nat Padua in 1310. He left Paris therefore at some time after 1303 and\r\nreturned to Padua at some time before 1310. Apparently he might have\r\nbeen in Bologna in 1305 but in 1307 he is listed as a member of a\r\ngild in Padua.[2775] Grabmann in his recent researches concerning the\r\nthirteenth century translations of Aristotle has called attention to\r\na translation of the History of Animals made from the Greek in 1260\r\nand of which Peter of Abano purchased a copy in 1309 from Francesco of\r\nMantua for the price of seven Venetian _soldi_.[2776]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Three works of astronomy and astrology.]\r\n\r\nIn the _Conciliator_ Peter refers a number of times to three works\r\nof his in the fields of astronomy and astrology, namely, a treatise\r\non the astrolabe, another on the motion of the eighth sphere, and a\r\nwork entitled _Lucidator_, of which the preface and a few chapters\r\nare extant and which perhaps was never finished, since such allusions\r\nto the work in the _Conciliator_ as I have noted are to these few\r\nchapters, while from the nature of these same allusions to the\r\n_Lucidator_ and from its own preface one would expect it to be of\r\nsomewhat the same length as the bulky _Conciliator_, since it was to\r\ndiscuss disputed points in the fields of astronomy and astrology in the\r\nsame way that the _Conciliator_ discussed them in the field of medicine.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Publications in the year 1310.]\r\n\r\nBut we now encounter the seeming difficulty that, while both the\r\n_Lucidator_ and work on the motion of the eighth sphere are cited\r\nin the _Conciliator_, which was finished in 1303, they both mention\r\n1310 as the date of their composition. A further indication that the\r\n_Lucidator_ was published after the _Conciliator_ is that in its\r\npreface Peter states that its method and arrangement will be similar\r\nto those of the _Conciliator_, which is also cited later in the text\r\nitself.[2777] Apparently, therefore, Peter had written first drafts\r\nof the two astronomical works before he finished the _Conciliator_ in\r\n1303, but did not complete or publish them until 1310. In that same\r\nyear, as we have seen, he completed his Commentary on the Problems of\r\nAristotle.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Undated and spurious works.]\r\n\r\nNo definite date can be assigned for some of Peter’s works, namely,\r\nhis continuation of the _Grabadin_ of the Arabian physician, Yuhanna\r\nibn Masawaih, to whose second book on remedies appropriate to diseases\r\nof particular parts of the body he added a discussion of remedies for\r\ncomplaints of the heart and digestive organs, and his edition of the\r\nmedieval Latin version of the _Materia medica_ of Dioscorides, of which\r\nwe have treated in an earlier chapter.[2778] Peter is also credited\r\nwith a Latin edition of the little tract on astrological medicine, or\r\nprognostication of diseases according to the motion of the moon in the\r\nsigns; but a Latin translation of the same work is also attributed to\r\nWilliam of Moerbeke who lived a little earlier. Some other medical\r\ntreatises that have been ascribed to Peter, like the Questions on\r\nFevers, listed in Mazzuchelli’s bibliography, are really portions of\r\nthe _Conciliator_. Works of geomancy and magic attributed to Peter and\r\nprobably spurious will be described more fully later in connection with\r\nthose subjects.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Closing years of his life.]\r\n\r\nIt has been stated by more than one author that Peter went to Treviso\r\nto teach medicine in 1314, but it is doubtful if he even received\r\na definite call from that city, although it had his name under\r\nconsideration.[2779] His salary at Padua has repeatedly been stated at\r\nthe high figure of five hundred pounds or lire a month but this amount\r\nreally represents his annual stipend.[2780] He must, however, have been\r\nfairly well-to-do--we have hints that his practice was lucrative--for\r\nin 1315 when he made his will he had not been paid any salary for three\r\nor four years, and yet had considerable property. Peter was dead before\r\nthe close of 1318,[2781] but the apparent attribution of his work on\r\npoisons to Pope John XXII[2782] makes it seem that he lived beyond\r\nAugust, 1316. One manuscript of that treatise speaks of Peter as acting\r\ndean of Montpellier at that time, but this is unlikely.[2783]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Relations with the church.]\r\n\r\nWe have dubious stories and more reliable data to show both that Peter\r\nhad intimate and friendly relations with popes, whom he seems to have\r\nserved in a medical capacity and from whom he received patronage and\r\nprotection, and on the other hand that he was in difficulties with\r\nthe Inquisition.[2784] Besides the fact that his work on poisons was\r\ncertainly written for some pope, if not for John XXII, we have the\r\ntale that he was physician to Pope Honorius IV (1285-1287) and charged\r\nhim one hundred florins a day.[2785] On the other hand, we have the\r\nassertion of Thomas of Strasburg, Prior-General of the Augustinian\r\nFriars from 1345 to 1357 that he was present in Padua when the bones\r\nof Peter of Abano were burned for his heretical errors, and the\r\nstatements of still later writers, which are perhaps after all merely\r\nunwarrantable inferences from Thomas’s assertion and from Peter’s\r\nown words in his will and the _Conciliator_, that Peter died while\r\nunder trial a second time by the Inquisition, which had once before\r\ninstituted proceedings against him unsuccessfully. But these matters\r\nrequire a longer discussion than seems advisable now and so will be\r\ntreated of more fully in Appendix VIII to this chapter.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Great reputation.]\r\n\r\nThe promptness with which Peter’s works appeared in book form after the\r\ninvention of printing and the number of times that the _Conciliator_\r\nand some others were reprinted attest his long continued reputation\r\nand popularity as a medical authority and man of broad general\r\nlearning. Regiomontanus, the renowned mathematician of the fifteenth\r\ncentury, when lecturing on Alfraganus at Padua, delivered a public\r\npanegyric upon Peter of Abano.[2786] It was perhaps to be expected\r\nthat Michael Savonarola, grandfather of the famous friar who tried to\r\nreform Florence and himself a physician and medical writer of some\r\nnote, should belaud Peter in his work on the great citizens of Padua\r\nin the past, which he wrote about 1445; and that these eulogies should\r\nbe repeated in such books as Scardeone’s _On the Antiquity of the\r\nCity of Padua_, Naudé’s _Apology for Great Men who have been falsely\r\nsuspected of Magic_, Tomasini’s _Eulogies of Illustrious Men adorned\r\nwith pictures_, and Duchastel’s _Lives of Illustrious Physicians_. But\r\nPeter’s reputation at the close of the middle ages is also attested\r\nin a criticism of some of his views by Symphorien Champier which\r\nwas written in 1514 and is found appended to the 1526 edition of\r\nthe _Conciliator_. Champier’s object is to correct Abano’s errors,\r\nthat is to say, those passages in the _Conciliator_ where he regards\r\nPeter’s views as bordering too closely upon magic or of too extreme an\r\nastrological character for a Christian. But he admits Peter’s great\r\nmedical reputation, stating that the most learned physicians praise the\r\nmedical and philosophical views of the _Conciliator_ and that Peter is\r\nbelieved to have surpassed all other Christian physicians in his study\r\nof medicine and advancement of truth. But, as Horace says, even Homer\r\nnods; hence Champier will correct Peter in a few points in order to\r\nenable lovers of Peter’s doctrines to get the benefit of them without\r\nfalling into his occasional errors.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Not a miracle in a rude age.]\r\n\r\nThe writers of the Renaissance and of early modern times became so\r\nenthusiastic over Peter of Abano, and at the same time so failed to\r\nappreciate the character and accomplishments of medieval learning in\r\ngeneral, that they were wont to depict him as a miracle of learning\r\nin a rude age--just as more recent scholars have over-estimated Roger\r\nBacon’s superiority to his time--and to regard the physician of Padua,\r\nlike the author of the _Divine Comedy_, as a precursor of their own\r\nperiod rather than as a final representative and product of a rich\r\nearlier period of culture. Thus Scardeone in the sixteenth century\r\nspoke of him as the first medical translator from Greek into Latin\r\nsince Roman days, forgetting earlier medieval translators of Greek\r\nmedicine like Burgundio of Pisa and William of Moerbeke. And in the\r\nseventeenth century Tomasini called Peter “a man most illustrious, in\r\ngenius, doctrine, and merits, in a rude and unhappy age,” while Naudé\r\ndeclared him “a man who appeared as a prodigy and a miracle in his\r\nage.” This depreciation of the times in which Peter had lived became\r\naccentuated, as in the similar case of Roger Bacon, by the report that\r\nhe had been persecuted by the medieval church.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: But completed the work of his period.]\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, as Dante really closed the medieval period of the\r\nflourishing of vernacular literature and the age of romance, so Peter\r\nof Abano came in a sense at the close of a period or movement in the\r\nhistory of science. He thus not unnaturally occupied himself especially\r\nin supplementing, correcting, and reconciling the work of his\r\npredecessors. Some works that had been unsatisfactorily translated,\r\nhe retranslated. Such important works of Aristotle, Galen, and others\r\nas he could find that had not yet been translated, he translated from\r\nGreek into Latin. He filled in the missing portion of the medical work\r\nof Yuhanna ibn Masawaih. And in his _Conciliator_, a tome of enormous\r\nbulk, he endeavored to reconcile and harmonize the conflicting opinions\r\nof the medical men and philosophers who had gone before him.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: No mere compiler.]\r\n\r\nPico della Mirandola at the close of the fifteenth century made a\r\ntrenchant criticism of Peter’s erudition, when he characterized him as\r\n“a man fitted by nature to collect rather than to digest.” But this\r\njudgment was also too severe, for Peter was no mere compiler, but\r\nsomething of an experimental astronomer as well as a painstaking and\r\ncritical translator, voluminous commentator upon Aristotle, and great\r\nmedical authority. In the _Conciliator_ he makes several references to\r\nhis personal astronomical observations and to other treatises which he\r\nhas composed upon astronomical topics and which are at least in part\r\nextant. He did not hesitate to correct the astronomical calculations\r\nof Ptolemy, and appreciated the margin of error in astronomical\r\nobservations caused by variations in the construction of instruments\r\nas well as in their employment by the human observer.[2787] His\r\n_Lucidator_, we have seen, was intended to parallel in the field of\r\nastronomy and astrology the achievement of the _Conciliator_ in that of\r\nmedicine; but the portion completed or extant is not a great addition\r\nto Peter’s science, since it covers about the same ground already\r\ndiscussed in portions of the _Conciliator_ and more especially in the\r\ntreatise on the motion of the eighth sphere.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The _Conciliator_ his masterpiece.]\r\n\r\nThe _Conciliator_ therefore remains his chief work and the one\r\nfor which he is most famous, his masterpiece and most influential\r\nwriting. Like the _Opus Maius_ of Roger Bacon, it to a large extent\r\ncovers his views as expressed elsewhere and is representative of his\r\nphilosophy and learning as a whole. It is in many ways a valuable\r\nhistorical document, providing a good example of scholastic method, a\r\nbroad picture of the state of medieval medicine, and much incidental\r\nillustration of the more general knowledge of Peter’s times, as when\r\nhe alludes to the overland travelers and to the ocean voyages of the\r\nthirteenth century. He learned from Marco Polo that there was human\r\nlife in the Antipodes, he cites a letter of John of Monte Corvino from\r\nIndia “in the coasts where lies the body of the Apostle Thomas,” he\r\nalludes to the attempt of two Genoese galleys to reach India by sea\r\n“almost thirty years ago”[2788]--two centuries before Vasco da Gama and\r\nColumbus. The _Conciliator_ does not, however, quite cover the entire\r\nfield of medieval science. The subjects of “geometry and perspective,”\r\nfor instance, Peter rather avoids, explaining, “The arguments taken\r\nfrom the books of geometricians and students of perspective, such as\r\nEuclid, Alhazen, and others, and marked out by letters of the alphabet,\r\nI omit because most of those for whom I am writing are unfamiliar with\r\nthat sort of thing.”[2789]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Its method.]\r\n\r\nThe _Conciliator_ is made up of over two hundred questions or\r\n“Differences” which Peter and his associates have been investigating\r\npublicly for the past ten years. Each problem is stated and any\r\ndoubtful terminology is explained; the utterances of past authorities\r\nanent the question are reviewed; the true solution is then reached\r\nand the reasons for it given; fourth and finally, hostile objections\r\nare answered. This rigid scheme of argumentation does not, however,\r\nprevent Peter from indulging in a deal of rather rambling digression.\r\nThis makes a very long volume, especially as supplementary questions or\r\ncorollaries are added to some of the two hundred odd _Differentiae_.\r\nAlso it is, like most works in scholastic form, hard and tiresome\r\nreading, as one has to keep in mind all the authorities and objections\r\nwhich Peter has cited and raised until he finally gets around to\r\nanswering them. Many of the questions concern purely medical matters\r\nand admit little debate between philosophers and physicians. The first\r\nten, however, deal with general questions such as whether medicine\r\nis a science, whether a doctor ought to be a logician, whether the\r\nhuman body is amenable to medicine, and whether the physician can help\r\nthe sick by a knowledge of astronomy. Nearly a hundred distinctions\r\nare then concerned with medical theory concerning the elements, the\r\nphysical constitution, generation, the members of the human body,\r\nfevers, and kindred questions. The last odd hundred distinctions deal\r\nwith matters of medical practice and personal hygiene.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Specimens of its questions.]\r\n\r\nThe mere list of these questions is interesting and illuminating, and\r\na few of them may be reproduced here to show the kind of questions\r\nthen debated by doctors--some of them are identical with the questions\r\nput by Petrus Hispanus in his _Commentary on the Diets of Isaac_--and\r\nto illustrate the broader scientific and philosophical interests of\r\nPeter’s volume and time.\r\n\r\n  11.

Renan admits that Peter knew neither the\r\n_Colliget_ nor the medical works of Averroes, while the doctrine of\r\nreligious change according to astrological conjunctions which he takes\r\nas a sign of Averroism[2793] in Peter came of course from much earlier\r\nArabian astrologers. Indeed, it would seem that most of the points of\r\nview which are loosely designated by the word “Averroism” had been\r\ncommon enough among earlier Arabic writers and had even in considerable\r\nmeasure been taken from other sources than Averroes himself by the\r\nLatin world. Only if we accept the very dubious and loose assertion\r\nof Renan that “medicine, Arabism, Averroism, astrology, incredulity,\r\nbecame almost synonymous terms,”[2794] can we connect Peter of Abano\r\nwith Averroism and even then we have the obstacles that Peter often\r\nmakes profession of Christian faith and that Steinschneider asserts\r\nthat he made no translations from the Arabic.[2795] And if astrological\r\nmedicine be Averroistic, Peter was certainly not the first Averroist in\r\nItaly.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Reputation for magic.]\r\n\r\nAlong with his reputation among the learned as a medical authority\r\nPeter acquired a popular reputation as a magician and nigromancer.\r\nThis reputation had become established by the middle of the fifteenth\r\ncentury, when Michael Savonarola tells us that Peter’s great knowledge\r\nof astronomy enabled him to make such predictions that men thought\r\nhe employed magic, and that the present tradition among his fellow\r\ntownsmen is that Abano was most skilled in the magic art. Of Peter’s\r\nastrological skill Savonarola tells the story that, noting the approach\r\nof an unusually favorable constellation, he advised the immediate\r\nbuilding of a new Padua in order to make her the queen of all cities.\r\nSimilarly Scardeone ascribed to Peter the idea of the numerous\r\nastrological pictures illustrating the influence of the planets and\r\nsigns upon terrestrial life with which the ceiling of the Palazzo della\r\nRagione at Padua is adorned.[2796] A different story and on the whole\r\nperhaps the most incredible one is told by Benvenuto of Imola,[2797]\r\nperhaps seventy years after Peter’s death. About to die, Peter said\r\nthat his life had been especially devoted to three noble sciences, of\r\nwhich one, philosophy, made him subtle; the second, medicine, made him\r\nrich; and the third, astrology, made him a liar.\r\n\r\nBut to return to Peter’s reputation as a magician. Savonarola, whom\r\nwe were quoting and who evidently has a favorable opinion of magic,\r\ncontinues, “Moreover, this helps to round out his teaching, nor\r\nis it contrary to his other sciences, but makes the man the more\r\nillustrious.” Naudé,[2798] on the contrary, endeavored to exculpate\r\nPeter from the charge of magic and regarded “the common opinion of\r\nalmost all authors” that he “was the greatest magician of his age and\r\nlearned the seven liberal arts from seven familiar spirits whom he held\r\ncaptive in a crystal,” as a legend developed from Peter’s astrological\r\npredictions and from his own statements concerning incantations in the\r\n156th _Differentia_ of the _Conciliator_. As for the story of seven\r\nfamiliar spirits, already before Naudé Giovan Francesco Pico[2799] had\r\nnoted the incongruity between the universal reputation of Peter of\r\nAbano as a magician and the doctrine attributed to him that there are\r\nno demons. Among the authors whom Naudé had in mind was doubtless the\r\nlearned Bodin who in the sixteenth century declared that Peter of Abano\r\nwas proved to have been easily the chief of Italy’s magicians. Naudé\r\nadmitted that Peter had left treatises in physiognomy, geomancy, and\r\nchiromancy, but held that he had then abandoned “the idle curiosity\r\nof his youth to devote himself wholly to philosophy, medicine, and\r\nastrology.”[2800] We have already stated that Champier’s criticisms of\r\nPeter’s teachings largely related to astrology and magic. Let us now\r\nturn to Peter’s own works and see what his attitude in regard to such\r\nmatters really was.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Summary of occult science in the _Conciliator_.]\r\n\r\nIn the _Conciliator_, as in most of his writings, Peter manifests\r\na marked weakness for astrology and an extensive familiarity with\r\nthat art. His penchant displays itself in the very prologue where he\r\nmentions “the power of genesis in the stars” (_vim geneseos sydeream_)\r\nin stating that most men are slaves not only in body but also in the\r\nnature of their minds. Peter also occasionally displays a credulous\r\ninterest in dreams, fascination, incantations, and other varieties of\r\nmagic. The sections of the _Conciliator_ in which he has most to say of\r\nsuch matters are as follows. In the ninth Difference, “Whether human\r\nnature is weakened from what it was of old?” he appeals to astronomy\r\nand astrology for support of his views and digresses to speak of his\r\nown astronomical researches and publications and of the influence of\r\nthe stars. The tenth _Differentia_, “Whether a doctor to-day can help\r\nthe sick by his knowledge of astronomy?” discusses at considerable\r\nlength the arguments against the art of astrology and argues in favor\r\nof astrological medicine. Question one hundred and thirteen, “Whether\r\nnatural death can be retarded by any benefit?” involves further\r\nastrological discussion. In Difference one hundred and fifty-six the\r\nefficacy of incantations in medicine is considered. We shall have\r\noccasion, however, to cite many other _Differentiae_ than these four.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Definition of astronomy and astrology.]\r\n\r\nBy Peter’s time the words “astronomy” and “astrology” were beginning to\r\nbe used in about their present meaning. He is at pains to explain that\r\ntheir derivation from the similar Greek words, _nomos_ and _logos_,\r\ndoes not justify this distinction. But he accepts the division of the\r\nscience of the heavens into two parts, one descriptive and dealing\r\nwith the measurement and motion of the stars, the other judicial and\r\nstudying their effects. This latter is subdivided as usual into the\r\nbranches of revolutions, nativities, interrogations, and elections,\r\nwhich last includes the science of images. Conjunctions go with\r\nrevolutions.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Nature controlled by the stars.]\r\n\r\nIn the tenth _Differentia_ of the _Conciliator_ Peter lists and\r\nreplies to a number of arguments against the art of astrology, such\r\nas that the distances involved are too great, the number of stars too\r\nnumerous, their influences too diverse and conflicting, the instant of\r\nnativity too minute, to admit of accurate calculation and prediction.\r\nThese objections remind us of those raised by Sextus Empiricus.\r\nAgainst such objections Peter adduces not only arguments of his own,\r\nbut the opinions of philosophers, astrologers, and physicians. All\r\nwise men agree, he says, that aside from God, the celestial bodies\r\nare the first causes of happenings in this world. Aristotle and the\r\nCommentator,[2801] indeed, hold that God does not act directly upon\r\nour lower world, and that all operations here are through mediums and\r\ninstruments; but the true Christian Faith contends that the Creator\r\ncan, if He will, affect His creatures “immediately and without motion\r\nand alteration.”[2802] Of the general law, however, that the natural\r\nworld is universally controlled by the heavenly bodies there can be no\r\ndoubt in Peter’s opinion. In another chapter[2803] he cites in favor\r\nof this view the assertion of Hermes, Enoch, or Mercury that each sand\r\nof the sea has its star influencing it, and that of the _Centiloquium_\r\nascribed to Ptolemy that the face of this world is subject to the face\r\nof the heavens.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Astrology a science.]\r\n\r\nThe only question is, how far are we able to follow the workings of\r\nthis general law in individual cases? The perfect astrologer would\r\nrequire a thorough acquaintance with all the infinite detail of nature\r\nand the powers of mind and body. Often therefore astrologers can only\r\napproximately and not precisely predict what the stars signify.\r\nBut the science of astrology should not be abused because certain\r\nmen who call themselves astrologers or physicians but are really\r\ndiviners and liars err in their judgments. But astrology proper is\r\nneither deceitful nor idle, and the astrologer “speaks the truth in\r\nmost cases and very rarely fails of correct prognostication except in\r\ncertain particulars.”[2804] Peter’s confidence in astrology despite\r\nthe complexity of the problems involved reminds one a little of the\r\nconfidence of the political or social scientist of the present in his\r\nmethods compared to those of the mere politician or indiscriminate\r\nphilanthropist.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: And not magic.]\r\n\r\nAgain in the first _Differentia_ of the _Lucidator_ Peter argues the\r\nquestion whether astronomy or astrology is a science and meets various\r\narguments raised against the study of the stars.[2805] He holds that,\r\nwhile difficult and laborious, it is noble and honorable, a beautiful\r\ndiscipline adapted to the loftiest intellects, an entirely lawful and\r\nlicit science. Like Michael Scot, Peter lists and defines various other\r\narts of divination and magic in order to show that the science of the\r\nstars is in no way superstitious, as some of them are, and that it\r\nneither conjures spirits nor employs exorcisms and suffumigations, as\r\ndo some arts of divination which try to justify themselves by claiming\r\na connection with the highly reputable science of the stars. Like Guido\r\nBonatti, Peter characterizes as “hypocrites” those who under pretense\r\nof defending God’s prerogatives attack judicial astrology as derogating\r\nfrom divine majesty and involving necessity and compulsion. Those who\r\ndetest such a science should rather be detested themselves, he says,\r\ntogether with those vulgar deceivers and charlatans whom they mistake\r\nfor astrologers.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Occult virtues from the stars.]\r\n\r\nIndeed, if the perfect astrologer should know nature and man\r\nthoroughly, it is also true in Peter’s opinion that astrology helps one\r\nto solve the problems of natural science. “We see,” he writes,[2806]\r\n“that precious stones and medicines have marvelous and occult virtues\r\nwhich cannot come from the qualities and natures of the elements\r\n(constituting them), since nothing acts beyond its species and every\r\nagent produces an effect in matter commensurate with itself.” It\r\nis useless to try to argue _a priori_ from the qualities of the\r\nconstituent elements what these occult properties of particular objects\r\nwill be; they can be investigated only by experience. And it seems\r\nevident to Peter that they can be accounted for only as products of\r\nthe influence of the stars. Indeed, the same species of plant, grown\r\nunder a different quarter of the heavens, may acquire new virtues.\r\nAll inferior objects, he affirms in another chapter,[2807] are filled\r\nby the action of those superior bodies with demoniac functions and\r\nvirtues, so that Aristotle in _De coelo et mundo_ says that some of\r\nthe ancients held that all these objects are full of gods. An indeed\r\nsuggestive passage from Aristotle, and more so than Peter of Abano or\r\nthe Stagirite himself realized, tracing back the conception of occult\r\nvirtue to its origin in fetishism and animism, whence too the gods\r\nsprang!\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Astrological medicine.]\r\n\r\nPeter was convinced that a knowledge of astronomy and astrology was not\r\nonly valuable but necessary in the practice of medicine. “Those who\r\npursue medicine as they should and who industriously study the writings\r\nof their predecessors, these grant that this science of astronomy is\r\nnot only useful but absolutely essential to medicine.”[2808] Peter\r\ncites Hippocrates and Haly in his support and advises the medical\r\npractitioner to look up the nativity of the patient, or, if this\r\nis impracticable, to address an interrogation on the case to an\r\nastrologer. By astronomy one can also foretell changes in the weather\r\nand regulate the treatment of the case accordingly. Diet and drink,\r\npurgatives and drugs, should all be administered with due regard to\r\nthe constellations. Two _Differentiae_[2809] of the _Conciliator_\r\ndiscuss at length the theme of critical days and their relation to the\r\nphases of the moon, which planet, as Peter more than once explains,\r\nis assumed to represent the influence of all the others, while to\r\nit is especially delegated the control of generation and corruption.\r\nThe doctor should therefore keep his eye especially upon the moon,\r\na point further emphasized in the pseudo-Hippocratic treatise of\r\nastrological medicine which Peter is said to have translated. In still\r\nanother chapter of the _Conciliator_[2810] the question at issue is\r\nwhether blood-letting is preferable in the first or some other quarter\r\nof the moon. Surgeons, too, should not operate when the stars are\r\nunpropitious and should note the apportionment of the members of the\r\nhuman body among the signs of the zodiac. When the patient’s symptoms\r\nare ambiguous, the perplexed doctor may bridge the gap in his medical\r\nprognostication by recourse to astrology. This will tend to increase\r\nhis reputation with his patients who will marvel at his power of\r\nprognostication. While thus discussing his tenth question, whether a\r\ndoctor should know astronomy, Peter adds that astrology is useful in\r\nmetaphysics as well as in medicine, giving as an example the fact that\r\nAristotle appeals to astrologers at one point of his _Metaphysics_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The stars and length of life.]\r\n\r\nPeter more than once touches upon the influence of the stars upon\r\nthe length of human life: in Difference 9, for example, where he is\r\ninquiring whether men lived longer in ancient times than in his own\r\nday; in Difference 21, where the point at issue is whether a temperate\r\n“complexion” is more conducive to longevity, and where he indulges\r\nin considerable detail about the control of the planets over the\r\nprocess of generation; and in Difference 113, where the question is\r\nwhether there is any way of putting off natural death. According to\r\nthe astrologers, one hundred and twenty years--the length of a greater\r\nsolar year--was the natural term of life, a considerable reduction from\r\nthe age of the patriarchs of the Old Testament, but much longer than\r\nmost men lived in Peter’s time. He thinks that the people of India live\r\nlonger because their climate is subject to Saturn. In Difference 26\r\nPeter divides the life of man into seven ages under the seven planets.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Nativities.]\r\n\r\nIt is clear from many passages in the _Conciliator_ that Peter\r\nbelieves that much of a man’s life and character can be inferred from\r\nhis horoscope. The geniture of a prince may involve the slaughter of\r\nvast multitudes in war, although their own horoscopes may not have\r\ndefinitely indicated this fate for them but only a certain inclination\r\nin that direction.[2811] Peter devotes considerable space and pains\r\nto the process of generation and the problem of measuring the time of\r\nnativity. He gives physiological explanations why twins, even before\r\nbirth, are not under the same astrological influence and approvingly\r\nquotes the lines of Lucan:[2812]\r\n\r\n    _Stant gemini fratres fecundae gloria matris_\r\n    _Quos eadem variis genuerunt viscera fatis._\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Revolution of the eighth sphere.]\r\n\r\nIn connection with the subdivision of judicial astrology known as\r\nrevolutions Peter was especially interested in the motion of the\r\neighth sphere of the fixed stars, concerning which we have seen he\r\nwrote a distinct treatise[2813] and of which he treats in both the\r\n_Lucidator_[2814] and _Conciliator_.[2815] Ptolemy had reckoned that\r\nthe sphere of the fixed stars moved one degree in a hundred years and\r\nthat consequently the eighth sphere made a complete revolution every\r\n36,000 years. Albategni’s estimate was 23,760 years for a complete\r\nrevolution or a motion of one degree in the course of sixty-six years.\r\nPeter’s own calculation was that one degree was accomplished in seventy\r\nyears. He regarded this as a matter of great importance because of the\r\nvast changes which he believed the revolution of the eighth sphere\r\nbrought about. Its influence could even change dry land into sea,\r\nas the story of the lost island of Atlantis showed. Peter mentions\r\nthe doctrine of the _magnus annus_, held by “certain Stoics and\r\nPythagoreans” that history would repeat itself as soon as the eighth\r\nsphere had accomplished a complete revolution. His own favorite theory,\r\nset forth three times in the aforesaid three works, was that when the\r\nheads of the equinoctial and tropical signs of the mobile zodiac come\r\ndirectly under the heads of the same signs of the immobile zodiac in\r\nthe heaven of the fixed stars, then virtue from the First Cause passes\r\nin a more perfect manner through the mediate causes or heavens and\r\nmen live longer and are stronger. For some five hundred years before\r\nand after the period of exact coincidence a golden age occurs, men of\r\ngenius appear in large numbers, and the world tends to unite under one\r\ngovernment. Such a period in Peter’s opinion was that of classical\r\nantiquity, when there were great rulers like Darius, Alexander,\r\nand Julius Caesar; great minds like Hippocrates, Plato, Aristotle,\r\nStoics and Peripatetics, Euclid, Abrachys, Ptolemy, Galen, Cicero,\r\nand Vergil; and when both the Roman law and the Christian religion\r\nwere promulgated. But then gradually, as the discrepancy between the\r\nmobile and immobile signs increases, all is changed to the contrary,\r\nhuman nature deteriorates, the span of life is shortened, monarchy is\r\ncorrupted, faith and law are made light of, the people are oppressed,\r\nand true sages are rare indeed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Conjunctions.]\r\n\r\nIn a number of places in the _Conciliator_ Peter discusses the subject\r\nof the effects of conjunctions of the planets. He states[2816] that\r\nvery rarely at long intervals of time, when a greatest conjunction of\r\nSaturn and Jupiter occurs in the beginning of the sign of the ram, a\r\nwell-balanced type of constitution[2817] is produced, but never more\r\nthan a single specimen at one time. Such a man becomes “a prophet,\r\nintroducing a new law or religion, and teaching sages and men.” Such\r\na man, according to Isaac Amaraan, Avicenna, and Algazetes, is midway\r\nbetween angels and sages, and some say that Moses and Christ were such\r\nmen. Peter also hints at a coincidence between the length of time\r\nthat astrology teaches that such a perfectly proportioned physical\r\nconstitution will last and the duration of Christ’s life. Champier\r\nincluded this passage in his list of Peter’s errors. Champier further\r\nattacked the astrological doctrine of great conjunctions and censured\r\nPeter for connecting Noah’s flood and the advent of Mohammed with them.\r\nIn another passage[2818] concerning this same conjunction of Saturn and\r\nJupiter in the first degree of _Aries_[2819] Peter asserted that it\r\nnot only altered the strength of human nature and affected the length\r\nof life but produced new kingdoms and religions, as in the case of\r\nthe respective advents of Moses, Nebuchadnezzar, Alexander the Great,\r\nChrist, and Mohammed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The astrological interpretation of history.]\r\n\r\nThis astrological interpretation of history Peter carries out in\r\nfurther detail. As he had divided man’s life into seven ages, so he\r\ndistributed periods of history among the seven planets. Each presides\r\nin turn over human affairs for a period of 354 years and four lunar\r\nmonths, a term analogous to the number of days in the lunar year. When\r\nMars governed the world, the flood occurred because of a greatest\r\nconjunction of the planets in the sign _Pisces_. Under the Moon’s\r\nsupremacy happened the dispersion of tongues, overthrow of Sodom and\r\nGomorrah, and escape of the children of Israel from Egypt. Peter also\r\nalludes to the less significant minor conjunctions which happen every\r\ntwenty years, to the moderate ones which take place every 240 or 260\r\nyears, and to the effects following eclipses. A solar eclipse seventy\r\nyears ago, he says, was followed by sterility of the soil, movements\r\nof phantasms and of good demons and bad demons, intercourse of incubi\r\nand succubi, a weakening of human nature and increase of avarice and\r\ncupidity.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Chronology.]\r\n\r\nThe chronology of some of Peter’s astrological periods of history\r\nhas been sharply criticized. Thus Lea remarks, “Even worse was his\r\nAverrhoistic indifference to religion manifested in the statement that\r\nthe conjunction of Saturn and Jupiter in the head of Aries, which\r\noccurs every 960 years, causes change in the monarchies and religions\r\nof the world as appears in the advent of Moses, Nebuchadnezzar,\r\nAlexander the Great, Christ, and Mahomet--a speculation whose\r\ninfidelity was even worse than its chronology.”[2820] The printed\r\neditions of the _Conciliator_ which I have consulted also give the time\r\nas 960 years, but it would seem as if the figure must have been wrongly\r\ncopied in or from the manuscripts, since in the _Lucidator_,[2821]\r\nwhich I have examined in manuscript, Peter shows acquaintance with\r\ndifferent systems of chronology, stating, for example, that Ptolemy\r\nand Galen flourished under Antoninus Pius in the year 886 of the era\r\nof Nebuchadnezzar or in 141 A. D. Peter therefore would appear to have\r\nknown perfectly well that no such period as 960 years had elapsed\r\nbetween the time of Nebuchadnezzar and Christ, to say nothing of\r\nAlexander and Christ. In another passage of the _Conciliator_,[2822]\r\nmoreover, Peter explains that conjunctions may precede by many years\r\nthe events which they signify and produce but which are long in the\r\nmaking. Thus the conjunction for the flood preceded it by 287 years\r\nand the conjunction connected with Mohammed came fifty years before\r\nhim, as Albumasar and Alchabitius state. In his treatise on the eighth\r\nsphere Peter stated that his theory of its motion and influence holds\r\ngood independently of the question whether the world is eternal, as\r\nall the philosophers except Plato held, or had a beginning and when\r\nthat beginning was. He gives, however, a list of various estimates of\r\nthe number of years since creation, such as Bede’s estimate of 5259;\r\nAbraham Judaeus’ of 5071; the Septuagint, 7270; Josephus, 5262; and\r\nso on up to the enormous figure of 1,474,346,290 years given by the\r\nIndians and Persians.[2823]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Astrological images.]\r\n\r\nPeter believed not only that astrologers could predict the future\r\nwith considerable assurance of success, but also that they could\r\ninfluence the future to suit themselves and perhaps change threatening\r\nmisfortune into good fortune by applying to earthly objects the occult\r\nvirtue of the heavenly bodies. The way to capture and store up such\r\ncelestial influence is by means of images made by human art with due\r\nreference to the constellations. Of such astrological images Peter\r\nspeaks frequently in the _Conciliator_.[2824] Physicians are advised\r\nto construct such images at the proper time when “the vivifying and\r\nhealth-exciting celestial light” will flow freely into them, as is\r\nillustrated by the astronomical images of Ptolemy, Thebith ben Chorat,\r\nand others. The figure of a scorpion made as the moon is leaving the\r\nsign of the scorpion cures that reptile’s bite.[2825] Human life can\r\nbe prolonged by such images which add to the influx of astral force\r\nreceived at birth.[2826] On the other hand, Peter elsewhere states the\r\ntheory that the impulse to construct an image was received at birth\r\nfrom the stars,[2827] and so does not really alter their influence. He\r\nusually, however, speaks as if the employment of images was a matter of\r\nchoice. They are more often made by night than by day, so that the rays\r\nof the sun may not obscure and dissolve those of the other heavenly\r\nbodies.[2828] The astronomers of India employ allegorical images.[2829]\r\nPeter himself “has tested to remove pain in the intestines the figure\r\nof a lion impressed on gold when the sun was in mid-sky, with the\r\nheart of a lion, when Jupiter or Venus was in aspect and the evil\r\nunfortunate stars were declining.” He bound this amulet “on the bare\r\nflesh with a string made of sea calf’s hide and a clasp from the bone\r\nof a male whale.”[2830] What could be more magical? In another passage\r\nPeter notes that theologians attribute the efficacy of such images to\r\ndemons, but he sets aside this suggestion as not in accord with his\r\npresent method, which apparently takes into account only natural and\r\nnot spiritual forces, although he suggests that the celestial light and\r\nforce may be regarded as the instruments of intelligences.[2831] In the\r\n_Lucidator_ Peter makes much the same distinction between astronomical\r\nand necromantic images as Albertus Magnus had made in the _Speculum\r\nastronomiae_. Notes by Peter on astrological images are contained in\r\nthe _Astrolabium planum_, published in 1488.[2832]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The stars and invocations, incantations, and fascination.]\r\n\r\nPeter refers twice in the _Conciliator_[2833] to his success with an\r\ninvocation to God to acquire knowledge, when the head of the dragon and\r\nJupiter were together in mid-sky and the moon was approaching them. He\r\nalso cites _Albumasar in Sadam_ for a similar practice by “the kings of\r\nthe Greeks,” when they wished to ask God for anything. Elsewhere[2834]\r\nhe states that the defenders of fascination and incantations aver that\r\ntheir potency consists in the virtue which the soul of the operator\r\nreceives from the stars, just as an image receives their motion and\r\nlight. The horoscope of the person uttering the invocation is a factor\r\nof some importance, but not the preponderating influence.[2835] Not a\r\nfew of the Magi invoke Jupiter, Saturn, or another heavenly body by the\r\nname of the intelligence which guides it.[2836]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Stars and spirits.]\r\n\r\nThis last passage and one or two others already cited show that\r\nPeter was inclined to associate spirits and intelligences with the\r\nheavenly bodies. Once he describes a celestial body as “perpetual and\r\nincorruptible, leading through all eternity a life most sufficient unto\r\nitself, nor ever growing old.” In the same chapter[2837] he tells us\r\nthat when Aristotle wished to investigate the number of Intelligences,\r\nhe betook himself to two famous astrologers and according to the number\r\nof spheres as stated by them calculated the number of Intelligences. In\r\nthe preceding chapter[2838] he had repeated from Averroes the following\r\nassociation of seven intelligences or angels with the planets: Saturn\r\nand Cassiel, Jupiter and Sachiel, Mars and Samael, the Sun and Michael,\r\nVenus and Anael, Mercury and Raphael, the Moon and Gabriel.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Were Peter’s views heretical?]\r\n\r\nThis passage and Peter’s invocation are a dangerously close approach\r\nto astrological necromancy. Enough so perhaps to justify the\r\nreproach which Champier repeated from some “recent authority” that\r\nPeter borrowed a great deal from Picatrix, “a very idle book full\r\nof superstitious prayers to planets and evil spirits.” Champier,\r\nhowever, cited no specific passages to substantiate this charge, and\r\nI doubt if it can be shown that the _Conciliator_ either cites or\r\nmakes unacknowledged quotation from Picatrix. It will also be observed\r\nthat Peter does not assert that the stars themselves are spirits or\r\nintelligences or gods, and that both Aquinas and Albert were inclined\r\nto agree that angels or heavenly intelligences moved the stars. That\r\nPeter’s views were objectionable to some persons, however, is indicated\r\nby the closing passage of this ninth _Differentia_, in which he has\r\nassociated seven spirits with the planets, the rise of prophets and\r\nnew religions with great conjunctions, and activity of demons with\r\nsolar eclipses. Some malicious persons have long troubled him, he says,\r\nbut his utterances in nothing derogate from divine wisdom but rather\r\nconfirm it, and at last an apostolic mandate has snatched him and his\r\ntruth from the hands of his detractors. In other words, the pope has\r\nprotected him. Peter’s astrology sometimes seems to show scant regard\r\nfor human free will, but he recognized it as an essential Christian\r\ndoctrine.[2839]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fascination.]\r\n\r\nPeter alludes several times[2840] to the subject of fascination in\r\nconnection with images and incantations. It seems evident that he is\r\nhere trying to account among other things for hypnotic power. In the\r\n_Lucidator_ he defines _maleficium_, the usual word for sorcery, as\r\na sort of fascination, “taking possession of one’s powers so that\r\none loses self-control,” and “impeding sexual intercourse.”[2841]\r\nIn opposing the theory that vision is by extramission of rays Peter\r\nexplains the deadly glance of the basilisk as due to corrupting vapor\r\nand not to visual rays, and fascination as caused by some more occult\r\nforce than the evil eye in a literal sense.[2842] And when arguing that\r\nthe confidence of the patient in the doctor is a factor in the cure\r\nPeter emphasizes the power of a strong will impressed in an occult\r\nfashion.[2843] Some men, it is true, like the followers of Asclepius,\r\ndeny any virtue of the mind and regard their fellow-men as swayed like\r\nbeasts by the passions of the senses, deeming wisdom, sobriety and\r\ncontinence a jest, calling human affection and altruism into question,\r\nand further despising dreams, divinations, prudent counsels and the\r\nwhole subject of astrology. But Peter believes in the power of one\r\nmind over another or over matter. Such a mind can cure the sick or\r\neven cast a man into a well or cause a camel to enter a Turkish bath\r\n(_caldarium_). It is also one of the causes of prophetic power. The\r\nbelievers in fascination and incantations say that such marvelous\r\nvirtues of the mind are derived from the stars. But Christians regard\r\nprophetic power as directly inspired by God, an opinion which seems\r\nridiculous to the Peripatetics.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Incantations.]\r\n\r\nIn much the same way Peter discusses incantations.[2844] He lists\r\nseveral definitions of an incantation, such as that ascribed to\r\nSocrates, “words deceiving human minds,” or “an utterance put forth\r\nwith astounding influence in aid of an enchanted person who is\r\nespecially confiding,” or “an utterance at discretion of meaningless\r\nwords, which since it has to do with the strange and occult is esteemed\r\nthe more by the person enchanted and so helps him the more.” An\r\nincantation may be either spoken, or written and bound on the body.\r\nThe enchanter should be astute, credulous, and strong-willed; the\r\nperson enchanted should be eager, hopeful, and disposed in every way\r\nto forward the success of the operation. Incantations are especially\r\neffective in sleep or in the case of women and simple folk who have\r\nthe more faith in them. Peter tells an amusing anecdote of a noble who\r\ntaught a poor old woman to repeat as an incantation the sentence,\r\n“Two and three make five and so do three and two.” He thought her a\r\nwitch, however, and when a fish bone stuck fast in his throat, sent for\r\nher to remove it. When he found that she really knew no magic except\r\nthe absurd incantation which he had himself taught her, he laughed so\r\nheartily that the bone was dislodged and he was thus cured by his own\r\nincantation after all.\r\n\r\nAll this sounds rather sceptical on Peter’s part, and he also\r\nrecalls Galen’s detestation of certain medical authors who wrote\r\ndown superstitious words and fables such as old-wives and witches\r\nare wont to repeat and stupid gypsies who utter fascinations. “For\r\nthey conjured and sprinkled and suffumigated medicines as if divine,\r\nwhen they plucked the herbs from the soil or when they suspended them\r\nabout the neck or elsewhere like a phylactery, all which is false\r\nand stupid and offensive to the art of medicine.” But while Peter\r\njoins in condemnation of such superstitious medicine, he yet believes\r\nin the efficacy of incantations and represents their opponents as\r\nincredulous and materialistic persons who will accept only action\r\nby gross material contact. He admits that there is no property in\r\nthe incantation itself nor in its sound when uttered to explain its\r\nmarvelous effects. We must look rather to the virtue of the mind of\r\nthe person repeating the charm, to faith on the part of the person to\r\nbe benefited, and to divine, angelic, demonic, or sidereal assistance.\r\nAt any rate experience demonstrates the validity of incantations and\r\nspoken words, as in the case of the Eucharist, or of the divine names\r\nemployed in the notory art, or the restoration to life of a dead man\r\nwhich was performed in Peter’s presence by magic words which the\r\nenchanter uttered in the ear of the corpse. Peter goes on to speak of\r\nthe movement of the holy wafer or Psalter or sieve towards a thief who\r\nenters a church. Other wonders wrought by incantations which he lists\r\nare the ability to endure torture without giving signs of pain or to\r\nwalk over sharp swords and hot coals without injury, to lift another\r\nman or raise a great weight with a single finger, to stupefy snakes\r\nand tame wild horses, cause insomnia, reveal the future, painlessly\r\nextract arrows that are so deeply embedded in the bone that they could\r\nnot be pulled out. Paroxysms of epilepsy may be quieted by pronouncing\r\nthe names of the three Magi in the patient’s ear. Peter also repeats\r\nthe cure for epilepsy found in so many medieval authors and involving\r\nreligious ceremonial and repetition of a verse from the Bible. Anent\r\nPeter’s allusion to the employment of divine names in the notory art,\r\nwe may note that a work on that subject is listed among evil books in\r\nhis _Lucidator_.[2845]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Number mysticism.]\r\n\r\nThe superstitious esteem for certain numbers which prevailed both\r\nin ancient and medieval times does not pass unnoticed in the\r\n_Conciliator_. Arguing the question whether the child born in the\r\neighth month will live,[2846] Peter discusses the subject of perfect\r\nand imperfect numbers for three columns, stating that this is the\r\ndoctrine of Pythagoras and of arithmeticians in general. In a later\r\nchapter,[2847] however, he declares that natural phenomena cannot be\r\nproved by arithmetical numbers since they are not caused by them, and\r\nalludes to Aristotle’s strictures upon Pythagoras.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Poisoning and magic.]\r\n\r\nPoisoning and magic were often scarcely distinguished in antiquity. The\r\nGreek word φάρμακον and the Latin _veneficium_ or _veneficus_ might\r\nhave reference either to poisoning or sorcery, either to a poisoner or\r\nenchanter. Plato states in his _Laws_[2848] that there are two kinds of\r\npoison employed by men which cannot be clearly distinguished, although\r\none variety injures the body “according to natural law,” while the\r\nother “persuades overbold men that they can work injury by sorceries\r\nand incantations.” The Latin poet Lucan centuries later drew a sharper\r\ndistinction when he declared, “The mind which is enchanted perishes\r\nwithout foul trace of poisoned draught,” and this dictum we have found\r\nembodied in more than one medieval definition and description of\r\nmagic. However, all magic is not enchantment; the poisoner and magician\r\nworked in the same secret and sinister style, sought similar injurious\r\nends, and availed themselves of the same powerful occult virtues\r\nin natural objects. Poisoning and bewitching seemed very similar\r\nprocesses, especially at a time when men believed in the existence\r\nof poisons which could act at a distance or after a long interval of\r\ntime. In one passage of the _Conciliator_[2849] Peter uses the word\r\n_veneficus_ rather in the sense of an enchanter or magician than a\r\npoisoner, when he says that, if you wish to injure another person or to\r\nmake him love you, the _venefici_ direct you to gaze fixedly at him at\r\nthe same time uttering a certain incantation. But let us now turn to\r\nthe treatise _De venenis_, in which Peter has much more to say on the\r\nsubject of poisons.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The treatise _De venenis_.]\r\n\r\nIt will be recalled that Peter’s treatise on poisons was written for\r\nthe pope. The topics considered in its six main chapters are: the\r\nclassification of poisons, how they act upon the body, how to guard\r\nagainst them, the effects and cures of a long list of particular\r\npoisons, and finally the problem of a panacea or _bezoar_ against\r\nall poisons. Peter classifies poisons according as they come from\r\nanimals, vegetables, or minerals, and as they take effect internally or\r\nexternally. Those which take effect internally are usually administered\r\nin food or drink, or swallowed without admixture. But one may be\r\npoisoned externally not only by contact, as in the case of snake-bite,\r\nbut through the sense of sight, as when the glance of the basilisk\r\nkills, and through the sense of hearing, as when the _regulus_[2850]\r\nkills bird or beast by its hiss. In fact, poisoning may be through any\r\none of the five senses. Some snake-bites Peter classifies under the\r\nsense of taste rather than touch. Other serpents emit a poisonous odor,\r\nor kill a person who touches them only with the tip of a long lance.\r\nThe hands and arms of fishermen become paralyzed when they take hold\r\nof nets in which a certain fish has become entangled. These last are\r\nperhaps exaggerated accounts based upon electrical shock.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Specific form or valence.]\r\n\r\nPoisons may also be classified according to the form of their\r\nspecies (_forma specifica_). Some prove fatal owing to the excessive\r\npreponderance of one quality, being excessively hot or cold or moist or\r\ndry. Others are deadly because their entire composition, the very form\r\nof their species, is fatal. Peter then gives an interesting definition\r\nof this “specific form.” “It is nothing else than the value or valence\r\n(_meritum_) which any object composed of the four elements acquires\r\nfrom the proportions of those elements existing in this compound\r\nand from the influence of the fixed stars which regard the species\r\nof inferior compounds.” Through the light of the stars streaming\r\ndown in straight lines pyramids of astral force concentrate upon\r\nterrestrial objects,--the same doctrine of stellar rays, emanation,\r\nand multiplication of species that we have met already in Alkindi,\r\nGrosseteste, and Roger Bacon. Peter adds that this specific form of any\r\ncompound is not easy to discover except as human experience gradually\r\nreveals it empirically, “because we do not know and we never shall know\r\nthe quantities and the weights of the elements in the compounds.” That\r\nis to say, Peter sees the desirability but despairs of the possibility\r\nof any such discovery as that of atomic weights and valences, and\r\nconsequently of a true science of chemistry. His despair is not\r\nsurprising in view of the fact that medieval men were still trying to\r\nconduct their scientific researches upon the outworn Greek hypothesis\r\nof only four elements, earth, air, fire, and water, all of which are\r\nreally compounds and indeed in the middle ages were not supposed to be\r\never found in their pure state. Desperation like Peter’s was needed\r\nbefore science could be induced to take a fresh start, and, like Arnald\r\nof Villanova, he is to be given credit for an approach to the chemical\r\nconception of valence.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: An allusion to alchemy.]\r\n\r\nWith the subject of alchemy, it may be remarked in passing, Peter\r\nappears to have had little to do, and not even any spurious treatises\r\non the subject are extant under his name, as they are in the cases\r\nof Albertus Magnus, Thomas Aquinas, Roger Bacon, Arnald of Villanova,\r\nand Raymond Lull. Colle,[2851] however, noted a passage in the\r\n_Conciliator_[2852] where Peter speaks of two friends of his who had\r\ntold him that they had succeeded “by the art of decoction” in making\r\nsilver which was true to every examination but from which they had not\r\nprofited much openly.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mineral, vegetable, and animal poisons.]\r\n\r\nIn his second chapter Peter discusses various mineral, vegetable, and\r\nanimal poisons under the caption, “Of each poison in particular” (_De\r\nunoquoque veneno in speciali_). Quicksilver made by the art of alchemy\r\nhe declares a more deadly poison than natural mercury. He is either\r\nan early advocate of inoculation and homeopathy, or else is guilty of\r\nsilly reasoning based upon sympathetic magic, when he states that the\r\nmagnet taken internally produces melancholy and lunacy and that doctors\r\nemploy it with other medicines to cure melancholy. Incidentally he\r\nmentions two kinds of magnet, one which attracts iron toward the north\r\npole, another which draws human flesh toward the south pole. Vegetable\r\npoisons may be the juices of herbs, the fruit of trees, or seeds. Some\r\nanimals have poison in their brains; some, in their tails; some, in the\r\nblood; some, in the saliva and spittle; some, in the gall; and some, in\r\ntheir entire bodies.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: How poison takes effect.]\r\n\r\nThe question, how poison takes effect upon the human body, occasions\r\nPeter considerable difficulty, since he is unwilling to admit either\r\nthat the heart naturally attracts poison or that poison runs naturally\r\nto the heart. Avicenna says that a man with a hot heart offers the best\r\nresistance to poison, but Peter adds that much depends upon the human\r\nsoul and the constellations. He notes that the action of poison is very\r\nsimilar to that of medicine and thinks that the art of medicine was\r\nsuggested by the action of poisons. Incidentally he repeats from his\r\nauthorities statements that there are trees whose shade is poisonous\r\nto sleep in or to bathe beneath, and that a man was killed by the\r\nvapor from wood cut near the caverns of serpents which was used as\r\nfuel in heating his bath. He also repeats the tale of Socrates and the\r\ndragon.[2853]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Safeguards against poison.]\r\n\r\nThe fourth chapter is concerned with safeguards against poison, which\r\noften take the form of amulets and charms and are, if anything, even\r\ncloser akin to magic than the poisons themselves. There are the horns\r\nof a serpent which sweat at the advent of certain poisons but not\r\nof others. There is the gem that ceases to gleam in the presence of\r\npoison. There is the stone which Alexander wore in his belt until\r\na jealous snake stole it while he was bathing in the Euphrates.\r\nThere is the following image recommended in the book of the Persian\r\nkings--possibly the _Kiranides_. Engrave the gem Ematites with a\r\nkneeling man girded by a serpent whose head he holds in his right hand\r\nand tail in the left.[2854] Set this stone in a gold ring and under the\r\ngem place a dried root of _serpentaria_. Either Peter or the author of\r\nthe book of the Persian kings affirms that he wears such a ring and\r\nhas been preserved from poisoning by it. An emerald is another good\r\nsafeguard against poison. Peter perhaps has a confused recollection\r\nof a story told by Albertus Magnus[2855] when he adds that it has\r\nbeen proved that a toad’s eyes will crack if it gazes at an emerald.\r\nThere are seven herbs, namely: Ipericon, “which Achilles is said to\r\nhave found in the Trojan army by the oracle of Apollo,” Vincetoxicum,\r\nEnula, Rafanus, Diptamus, Aristologia, and Lactucella, which will cure\r\nany poison. This virtue is not due to the elements composing them\r\nbut to the force of the seven planets. Peter’s antidotes are not all\r\noccult or talismanic. He also prescribes the more commonplace methods\r\nof a drink of butter and hot water to provoke vomiting, the use of a\r\nsyringe to clear the intestines, the application of a relay of hot\r\nfowls to the wound, or the sucking of it “by the mouth of some slave\r\nor servant”--_sclavi vel servi_, an interesting bit of etymological\r\nevidence of the medieval transition from the Latin _servus_ to the\r\nmodern word “slave,” and for the derivation of the latter from the\r\nSlavs who were sold in southern and western Europe. Peter also mentions\r\nthe famous _terra sigillata_ which, he says, causes vomiting if there\r\nis any poison in the stomach. Kings and princes in the west[2856] take\r\nit with their meals as a safeguard, and it is called _terra sigillata_\r\nbecause stamped with the king’s seal. Now, however, the seals are no\r\nlonger trustworthy and Peter cautions the pope against what may be\r\noffered him as _terra sigillata_.[2857] Over seventy brief chapters are\r\nnext devoted to enumeration of the effects produced by as many poisons\r\nand how to remedy them. The poisons include the blood of a rubicund,\r\ncholeric man, the bite of a fasting man, the gall of a leopard, and\r\nthe salamander. Among the remedies are duck’s fat and pulverized mouse\r\ndung. The remedies operate against the poison either by “breaking\r\nits sharpness,” or “resolving its substance,” or “expelling it,” or\r\n“corrupting it and utterly taking away its virtue.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The bezoar.]\r\n\r\nFinally Peter comes to the discussion of “bezoartic virtues” which free\r\nfrom death by occult and divine virtue rather than by their natural\r\ncomposition. Under this head he proposes to deal with two difficult\r\nquestions: first, whether theriac is a bezoar (i. e., antidote or\r\npanacea) and medicine for every poison; second, whether there is any\r\npoison which can be set to act at a given time, so that the victim\r\nwill die from it then and not before. In those copies of the _De\r\nvenenis_ which I have seen the discussion of this second question is\r\nnever reached. Perhaps it was intended only for the pope’s ear and not\r\npublished. As for the former question, some believe in a bezoar or\r\nstone that frees from all poisons without medical assistance. Edward\r\nI of England, when wounded by the Sultan’s poisoned sword, is said to\r\nhave been cured by such a stone which “the general preceptor of the\r\nTemple gave him, and I have seen one like it.” It is red, purulent,\r\nlight as a sponge, and fragile as gypsum. But Peter inclines to believe\r\nthat each poison has its own antidote which is the best cure for it.\r\nLike Galen, however, he extols that “divine and noble” artificial\r\ncompound, theriac, a mixture of all the single medicines which break\r\nor dissolve or expel poisons. It may, he thinks, deservedly be called\r\n_Bezoar_, since it is good against all poisons, although for any\r\nparticular poison there may be a superior particular remedy. After\r\nPeter’s treatise has apparently ended with the words, _Deo gratias_,\r\nthere is added a note from the Pandects concerning the stone _Begaar_\r\nor Bezoar, asserting its reality and superiority to any simple antidote\r\nor any of the compound theriacs.[2858]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Physiognomy.]\r\n\r\nPeter’s treatise on physiognomy mentions Philemon, Aristotle, Palemon,\r\nand Loxius as the founders of the art, and Rasis, Zacharias, and\r\nAvicenna as Arabian authorities. Peter proposes to combine their\r\nseparate contributions to the subject “into one lucid and perfect\r\ndoctrine.” The first draft intended for the captain-general of Mantua\r\nhas got into “the hands of some rascal who scorns to communicate\r\nit to me or others.” At the sollicitation of his friends and lest\r\ninvidious detractors envying another’s work gain glory from it, Peter\r\nhas written another draft which he flatters himself is longer and\r\nbetter. “So praise be,” he piously ejaculates, “to God, the better\r\nproducer of everything, who from that evil has created this good and\r\nbest!” Peter’s treatise differs from other Physiognomies mainly in its\r\nemphasis upon astrology, to which its third book is largely devoted.\r\nHe gives the influence of each sign and planet upon the physique and\r\ncharacter of the person born under it, and discusses in considerable\r\ndetail the process of generation, the influence of heredity as well as\r\nof the stars, and the effect upon the babe of any strong imagination,\r\nespecially on the part of the mother, during the period of generation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Astrology in his other works.]\r\n\r\nPeter’s penchant for astrology is further evidenced by his Latin\r\nversion of the various astrological treatises of Abraham Aben Ezra,\r\nand his translation of the brief treatise attributed to Hippocrates on\r\nthe prognostication of diseases according to the moon. Peter or some\r\nprevious translator or editor opens it by saying that while reading the\r\nworks of Hippocrates he found this book, “small but of great utility\r\nand very essential to all physicians. Whoever is well acquainted\r\nwith it can pronounce health, death, or life in every infirmity.”\r\nPeter brings in astrology even in his commentary on the Problems of\r\nAristotle. When Aristotle mentions an astronomer or astrologer in\r\na derogatory manner in the same breath with a juggler or mime or\r\npipe-player or rhetorician, Peter is at pains to explain that in\r\nAristotle’s time the science of judicial astrology had not yet attained\r\nits present perfection.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Attitude to “magic.”]\r\n\r\nIn those of his works which are certainly genuine Peter seldom uses the\r\nword “magic” and never, I think, speaks of it approvingly, although\r\nMichael Savonarola could see no reason why he should not do so. Despite\r\nhis reputation for magic, the longest discussion of such arts in his\r\nadmittedly genuine works occurs in the _Lucidator_,[2859] where, after\r\nthe manner of Michael Scot and Albert in the _Speculum astronomiae_,\r\nhe is chiefly concerned to distinguish astrology favorably from these\r\nother forms of divination and magic. With occasionally some additional\r\ndetail he mainly repeats the old account of the origin of magic with\r\nZoroaster or Cham, the son of Noah, and with Hermes or Enoch or\r\nMercurius; and the old classification of the occult arts found in\r\nIsidore and Hugo of St. Victor.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Magic books ascribed to him.]\r\n\r\nNaudé states, on the authority of Castellan, that when Peter was\r\nburned in effigy after his death, the reading was forbidden of three\r\nsuperstitious and abominable books which he had composed, entitled\r\nrespectively, _Heptameron_, _Elucidarium Necromanticum_, and _Liber\r\nexperimentorum mirabilium de annulis secundum 28 mansiones lunae_ (Book\r\nof marvelous experiments with rings according to the twenty-eight\r\nmansions of the moon).[2860] Naudé adds, however, that Trithemius\r\nand Symphorien Champier could find no books on magic by Peter of\r\nAbano.[2861] Such treatises, however, exist both in print and in\r\nmanuscripts, which last are mainly of late date, and will be found\r\nlisted in Appendix II. Prophecies ascribed to “the most reverend\r\nnigromancer, Peter of Abano,” were printed in Bologna in Italian about\r\n1495 and occur also in Latin in a Vatican manuscript. The printed\r\n_Heptameron_ or _Elements of Magic_ consists entirely of specific\r\ndirections how to invoke demons, and if genuine, might account for\r\nChampier’s charge that Peter borrowed from Picatrix. The reader is\r\ninstructed in the construction of the magic circle, in the names of the\r\nangels, and concerning benedictions, fumigations, exorcisms, prayers to\r\nGod, visions, apparitions, and conjurations for each day of the week.\r\nThe work seems quite certainly spurious.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Geomancy.]\r\n\r\nIt is more probable that Peter may have written a geomancy in view\r\nof his devotion to astrology and Naudé’s statement that he had left\r\ntreatises in “physiognomy, geomancy, and chiromancy.” At any rate\r\na geomancy exists under his name in several printed editions and\r\nmanuscripts. In the _Conciliator_ he asserted that the future and what\r\nwas absent could be predicted by means of characters “as geomancy\r\nteaches.”[2862] In the _Lucidator_ he concisely described the method\r\nof geomancy, and admitted that its figures were produced under the\r\ninfluence of the constellations and that not infrequently its judgments\r\nwere verified, but he regarded it as a very difficult science of\r\nprediction and one requiring long experience and practice, although\r\nmany persons tried their hand at it because it looked easy.[2863]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Conclusion.]\r\n\r\nSuch was the attitude of the learned and influential Peter of Abano\r\nat the close of the thirteenth and opening of the fourteenth century\r\ntoward the subjects which we are investigating. We may well agree\r\nwith Tomasini that he combined medicine and philosophy, astrology\r\nand natural magic, in the closest union. He amassed a great deal of\r\nthe lore of the past, Greek, Arabic, and the writings of his Latin\r\npredecessors. Indeed, when he repeats what earlier Latin writers in the\r\nthirteenth century had said, just as they had repeated what the Arabs\r\nsaid, we rather begin to weary of the subjects under discussion and to\r\nfeel that medieval Latin learning is growing stagnant or stereotyped.\r\nPico della Mirandola spoke of Peter not only as “a man fitted by nature\r\nto collect rather than to digest,” but also as one “whom alas the less\r\nlearned are wont to admire most when he lies most.” In other words,\r\nPeter’s failings continued general for some time. The Latin epitaph\r\nwhich Tomasini in the seventeenth century drew up to accompany the\r\nportrait of Peter in his book on illustrious men, although containing\r\none or two erroneous statements which we have already corrected, sums\r\nup rather well the salient points of both Peter’s learning and occult\r\nscience. It may be translated thus:\r\n\r\n“From a rural locality, of auspicious cognomen, a man most illustrious\r\nin genius, doctrine, and merits, in a rude and unhappy age became the\r\nmost fortunate and learned physician. Now too he shines with rays\r\neternal, investigator of all natural forces. He gave the secrets of\r\nthe Greek tongue to the Latin idiom by his power of assiduous practice\r\nand constant reading. Employing the virtues of herbs and stones, the\r\nsure aspects of the sky, stated hours and moments, by the crowd he was\r\nreputed to fascinate men. He opened the arcana of the art medical; he\r\nreconciled conflicts, a wonderful warrior! The name of Conciliator he\r\nwon by uniting medicine and philosophy, astrology and natural magic, in\r\nthe closest bond. Born for study, he died studying. A. D. 1316, aged\r\n66.”[2864]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[2757] As distinguished a scholar as Steinschneider (1905), pp. 58-9,\r\nfor example, gives the date of his birth as 1253 or 1246.\r\n\r\n[2758] Appendix I, “Previous Accounts of Peter of Abano,” describes the\r\nsources and secondary accounts.

Another important document\r\nis his will, published by Verci, whose _History of the Trevisan Mark_\r\nincludes some other documents bearing upon Peter’s career.[2866]\r\nOther contemporary source-material connected with Peter or members\r\nof his family has been noted by Gloria in his collection of material\r\nconcerning the University of Padua,[2867] or by even more recent\r\ninvestigators. Less valuable are the inscriptions, chiefly sepulchral\r\nor eulogistic, which older writers reported but whose dates are late or\r\nuncertain. In a MS of the fifteenth century[2868] a page between two of\r\nPeter’s treatises is devoted to a “Catalogue of writings which Peter\r\nof Abano partly composed himself, partly translated from the Greek.”\r\nThe list has not, I think, been noted by previous writers on Peter of\r\nAbano, but adds little to our knowledge of his compositions. What the\r\nsources for Peter’s life are, however, appears in more detail in the\r\nappendices which follow and in the notes to the text.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Michael Savonarola.]\r\n\r\nWhat we have to consider further at present are the previous secondary\r\naccounts of Peter which may be reckoned as of some importance. The\r\nfirst occurs in the work on great citizens of Padua composed about\r\nthe middle of the fifteenth century[2869] by Michael Savonarola, the\r\nnoted physician and medical writer and grandfather of the Florentine\r\nreformer, Girolamo Savonarola. Michael at least appreciated Peter’s\r\nlearning and shared in many respects his point of view, and, while he\r\nmakes some assertions which we must regard as extremely exaggerated,\r\nif not entirely legendary, seems to have had access to documents\r\nwhich we no longer possess as well as to local tradition. He states\r\nthat he treasures in his possession the original manuscript of the\r\n_Conciliator_ in Peter’s own handwriting; and he mentions having\r\nread with great pleasure an abundance of letters by which the people\r\nof Padua had recalled Peter from Paris to their midst. Savonarola’s\r\naccount, however, is brief.[2870]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Secondary accounts since 1500.]\r\n\r\nScardeone, who wrote in the sixteenth century _On the Antiquity of the\r\nCity of Padua_,[2871] can scarcely be regarded as so good an authority\r\nas Savonarola, but he makes new assertions concerning Peter’s life and\r\nhis account has been much followed by modern writers. In the early\r\nseventeenth century Naudé included Peter in his defense of great men\r\nwho had been charged with magic,[2872] but incorrectly gave the date of\r\nhis death as 1305, while Tomasini gave 1316 as the date and included\r\na portrait of Peter in his _Eulogies of Illustrious Men adorned with\r\npictures_.[2873] I have not seen the account of Peter in Duchastel’s\r\n_Lives of Illustrious Physicians_,[2874] published at Antwerp in\r\n1618, nor Goulin’s _A Historical and Critical Notice on the Life of\r\nAbano_,[2875] printed in 1715; but have used an article with a similar\r\ntitle which Count Gian-Maria Mazzuchelli[2876] published in 1741 and\r\nwhich included a bibliography of Peter’s works. Tiraboschi, in his\r\n_History of Italian Literature_,[2877] corrected and supplemented\r\nMazzuchelli on a number of points and in general displayed a sounder\r\njudgment than previous writers, although he still retained some of\r\ntheir errors. A further step in the study of Peter of Abano was taken\r\nby Colle who published a monograph concerning him in 1823,[2878] which\r\nhe reprinted in 1825 with some variations in his _Scientific and\r\nLiterary History of the University of Padua_.[2879] A monograph by\r\nRonzoni in 1878[2880] does not seem to have made any new contributions,\r\nbut in 1884 Gloria adduced new source-material in his _Monuments of the\r\nUniversity of Padua_,[2881] and pointed out errors in Colle’s account.\r\nSante Ferrari discussed Peter’s contributions to biology in a pamphlet\r\npublished in 1900,[2882] when it was stated that he would soon issue\r\na volume upon Peter, which has been supplemented in 1918 by a further\r\nstudy. Meanwhile in 1912 B. Nardi discussed “The theory of the soul\r\nand the generation of forms according to Peter of Abano,”[2883] and\r\nin 1916 Antonio Favaro wrote on “Pietro d’Abano ed suo ‘Lucidator\r\nastrologiae’.”[2884]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[2865] An account of the editions and MSS of them will be found in\r\nAppendix II.\r\n\r\n[2866] G.

Next will be listed those which\r\nare undated but undoubtedly genuine. Last will be mentioned those\r\nof dubious or spurious authorship. As Peter’s translations of the\r\nastrological treatises of Abraham Aben Ezra are closely connected with\r\nthose of Henry Bate, and as Abraham and Bate are names of considerable\r\nimportance in the history of astrological literature, a separate\r\nappendix following this one will be devoted to them and Peter’s\r\nrelations to their work. The following lists of MSS for Peter’s various\r\nworks can probably be greatly added to, but the present bibliography is\r\nfuller than any preceding one.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Translation of Abraham Aben Ezra, 1293.]\r\n\r\nAside from Latin editions of single works (such as the _De\r\nnativitatibus_, Ratdolt, 1485, Cologne, 1537, which is not Peter’s\r\noriginal Latin version anyway; and the _De luminaribus et criticis\r\ndiebus_, 1508, 1544; _de criticis diebus_, 1496, 1550) the only\r\ninclusive edition seems to be:\r\n\r\n Abrahe Avenaris Judei ... in re judiciali opera, ab\r\n   excellentissimo Philosopho Petro de Abano post accuratam\r\n   castigationem in Latinum traducta, Ex officina Petri\r\n   Liechtenstein, Venetiis, 1507. For further account of this\r\n   edition and the MSS see Appendix III.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The _Physiognomy_, 1295.]\r\n\r\n Incipit liber compilationis phisonomie a Petro padubanensi\r\n   in civitate Parisiensi.... Viro fulgenti domino Bardeloni\r\n   de bocosis mantue honorandissimo capitaneo generali Petrus\r\n   padubanensis parisius philosophie minimus alumnorum grata\r\n   agere cum salute. Ed. Padua, 1474.\r\n\r\n Decisiones Physionomiae ... a Blondo medico ... compertae\r\n   inque lucem productae. Venice, 1548.\r\n\r\nThe earliest MS that I have seen is\r\n\r\n BN 16089, 13-14th century, fols. 98r-113, “Incipit liber\r\n   compilationis physonomie a magistro petro de padua in\r\n   civitate parisiensi....

Here the captain-general’s\r\n   name is spelled “Bardeloni ... de Bonaconsis” and the\r\n   Explicit gives the precise date, May 23, 1295.\r\n\r\n BL Canon. Misc. 46, fols. 1-30, “Liber Physionomiae\r\n   clarissimi viri Petri de Appono Patavini ab eo in civitate\r\n   Parisiensi aeditus.”\r\n\r\n CLM 637, fols. 12-66.\r\n\r\n Vienna 5307, fols. 23-32.\r\n\r\nThe work is listed in the catalogue of the MSS of Amplonius at\r\nErfurt, written in 1412, “Math. 29, Egregius liber Petri Paduani de\r\nphisionomia,” but seems to have disappeared from that collection since\r\nthen.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Problems_ of Alexander of Aphrodisias.]\r\n\r\n Escorial f-I-11, 14th century (here we first have the\r\n   Problems of Aristotle, or perhaps Peter’s commentary\r\n   on them “secundum speciem compilationis” and “secundum\r\n   novam translationem,” then), fols. 31-42, “Incipiunt\r\n   problemata alexandri affrodiseos translata p.

Misc. 46, speaks of\r\n   these Problems as having “differentiae quinquaginta.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Translations of Galen.]\r\n\r\n CLM 5, written in 1304 A. D., fol. 181, Galeni de optima\r\n   corporis nostri compositione et bona habitudine translatus\r\n   per Petrum medicum Paduanum.\r\n\r\n S. Marco XIV, 6, written at Bologna in 1305 A.

Misc. 46 Peter is credited with the\r\ntranslation of six of Galen’s treatises, namely: de cholera nigra,\r\nde utilitate particularium, de optima compositione, de tabe, liber\r\ncreticorum, and a sixth title which I did not clearly make out, “Item\r\ntranstulit librum eiusdem de re fa (or sa, perhaps sanitate) de verbo\r\nad verbum non sicut ille abreviatur.” This last translation was in 18\r\nchapters.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The _Conciliator_, 1303.]\r\n\r\n Conciliator differentiarum philosophorum et precipue\r\n   medicorum. Printed eight times before 1500 and several\r\n   times thereafter. Most editions are to be found in the\r\n   British Museum, but it does not have the first edition\r\n   of 1471, Venetiis apud Octavianum Scotum, although it\r\n   possesses the Venetian editions of 1521 and 1526, which\r\n   are omitted from the bibliographies of Mazzuchelli and\r\n   Colle. I have chiefly used, at the John Crerar Library,\r\n   Chicago, the edition of 1526, and at the British Museum\r\n   the very rare second edition, Mantua, 1472. The editions\r\n   of 1476, 1483, 1490, and 1496 are also found in America\r\n   (CFCB).\r\n\r\n Quaestiones de febribus, pp. 217-40, in a collection of\r\n   various authors on fevers printed in 1576, are simply nine\r\n   Differentiae from the Conciliator.\r\n\r\nNot many MSS appear to have survived; some are:\r\n\r\n BN 6961, 1384 A. D., conciliator discordiarum medicinalium.\r\n\r\n BN 6962, 15th century.\r\n\r\n Library of the Dukes of Burgundy, 10871, early 16th century,\r\n   Petri de Abano, Conciliator de medicinis, “Ad melius\r\n   intelligendum.”\r\n\r\n Medic. 54, “Egregie questiones Petri Paduani consiliatoris,”\r\n   in the 1412 A. D. catalogue of Amplonius, seems no longer\r\n   in that collection.\r\n\r\n Harleian 3747, 15th century, fol. 233, Petri de Ebano de\r\n   balneis, is probably an extract from the Conciliator.\r\n\r\n Vienna 5289, 15th century, fol. 15r, Cura epidimiae, “Recipe\r\n   radices pedis corvini ... / ... adiustionem prohibitum,”\r\n   ascribed to Peter and immediately followed by his De\r\n   venenis, is perhaps also an extract from the Conciliator.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _On the astrolabe._]\r\n\r\nIt appears to have been printed twice but I have not seen either\r\nedition:\r\n\r\n Astrolabium planum in tabulis ascendens continens\r\n   qualibet hora atque minuto aequationes domorum coeli\r\n   significationes imaginum moram nati in utero matris cum\r\n   quodam tractatus nativitatum necnon horas inaequales pro\r\n   quolibet climate mundi, Venice, 1488; and 1502 (Luc’\r\n   Antonio de Giunta).\r\n\r\nPerhaps it is the same as the following work ascribed to Peter in a MS\r\nat Munich which I have been unable to inspect:\r\n\r\n CLM 22048, 15th century, 176 fols., De signis celestibus\r\n   eorumque significatione et potestate, cum multis tabulis\r\n   astronomicis.\r\n\r\nKroll and Skutsch, in their edition of Julius Firmicus Maternus, II\r\n(1913), xxviii, list what appears to be another edition of the same\r\nyear, 1488, at Augsburg, and which they say was reprinted in 1494 and\r\noften thereafter.\r\n\r\n Opus Astrolabii plani in tabulis: a Iohanne Angeli artium\r\n   liberalium magistro a nouo elaboratum; explicit feliciter.\r\n   Erhardi ratdolt Augustensis viri solertis: eximia\r\n   industria: et mira imprimendi arte: qua nuper veneciis:\r\n   nunc Auguste vindelicorum excellet nominatissimus.\r\n   Vigesimoseptimo kalendas Novembris.

Whether these\r\nbrief notes are Peter’s sole connection with the Astrolabium planum,\r\nthey do not make clear.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _On the motion of the eighth sphere_, 1310.]\r\n\r\nI have seen it stated somewhere that it forms a part of the preceding\r\nwork. I have read the treatise in the first of the following MSS:\r\n\r\n Canon. Misc. 190, 1445 A. D., fols. 78r-83v, Tractatus motus\r\n   octave spere.\r\n\r\n Cod. Vatic. Palat. Lat. 1377, 14-15th century, fols.\r\n   1r-5r, “Incipit tractatus quem composuit magister Petrus\r\n   Paduanus in motu octave spere et sequitur capitulum primum\r\n   prohemiale in operis causa et ipsius intentione. Quoniam\r\n   iuxta Ptholomeum rerum quippe causas ... / ... inde causa\r\n   existit prefati. Explicit tractatus motus octave spere\r\n   ordinatus a magistro Petro Paduanensi anno gratiae 1310.”\r\n\r\n Vienna 5498, 15th century, fols. 60r-70v, “Libellus in motu\r\n   octave sphere.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The _Lucidator_, 1310.]\r\n\r\nThe fuller title, “Lucidator dubitabilium astronomie,” is used by Peter\r\nhimself in citing the work in the Prohemium to his treatise on the\r\nmotion of the eighth sphere.\r\n\r\n BN 2598, following the Physonomia, fols. 99r-125v, “Quoniam\r\n   astrologyce considerationis ambiguitates....” At fol. 125v\r\n   the copyist, Petrus Collensis, whom Duhem characterizes\r\n   as “scribe aussi maladroit qu’ignorant latiniste,” adds\r\n   his name and a table of contents comprising ten questions.\r\n   But the last four of these do not seem to be discussed in\r\n   the text, of which the last three pages contain rather\r\n   the beginning of the treatise on the motion of the eighth\r\n   sphere. Therefore we have only the preface and first six\r\n   Differentiae of the Lucidator. No copy of the Lucidator\r\n   was known before Duhem, Études sur Léonard de Vinci,\r\n   1906-1909, I, 50-51, called attention to this MS.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Commentary on the _Problems_ of Aristotle, 1310.]\r\n\r\n Expositio in librum problematum Aristotelis, Mantua 1475;\r\n   Padua, 1482, 1501, 1520. The editio princeps of 1475 is\r\n   not in the British Museum, although it has the other three\r\n   editions, but copies of it exist in America (CFCB). The\r\n   1482 edition is said to have really been printed at Venice\r\n   by Herbort. I have consulted the edition of 1482 in this\r\n   country at the Columbia University Library. The Incipit\r\n   in the 1482 edition reads, “Expositio praeclarissimi\r\n   atque eximii artium ac medicinae doctoris Petri de Ebano\r\n   Patavini in librum Problematum Aristotelis feliciter\r\n   incipit.”\r\n\r\n But the Explicit is given imperfectly in this 1482 edition\r\n   and may better be repeated after a Venetian MS, S. Marco\r\n   XII, 84, 14th century, fols. 1-139, “Explicit expositio\r\n   succincta compilationis problematum Aristotelis quam\r\n   Petrus edidit Padubanensis et a nullo prius interpretante;\r\n   incepta quidem Parisius et laudabiliter Paduae terminata\r\n   anno legis Christianorum millesimo trecentesimo decimo\r\n   cum laude Dei altissimi cuius nomen sit benedictum per\r\n   saecula, amen.” The Explicit as given in the first\r\n   edition similarly stated that Peter composed the work\r\n   partly in Paris and finished it in Padua in 1310. The\r\n   Venetian MS just mentioned omits the text of Aristotle and\r\n   gives only Peter’s commentary.\r\n\r\n BN 6540. An illuminated MS with a picture at the beginning\r\n   of a smooth-shaven man in gown and hood which is possibly\r\n   meant for Peter. This MS would presumably be the\r\n   autograph, were the MSS Catalogue right in dating it in\r\n   1310 A. D.; but I think that the date when the Explicit\r\n   states that the work was completed has been incorrectly\r\n   assumed to be the time when the MS was written.

According to the MSS Catalogue,\r\n   the prologue differs from that in the 1519 (1520?)\r\n   edition, but the text is the same except that it stops in\r\n   the midst of the 28th problem under Particula X.\r\n\r\n Digby 77, 14th century, fols. 57-82, Summa Problematum\r\n   Aristotelis “secundum Petrum Paduanensem.”\r\n\r\n BM Addit. 21978, 1477 A.

I have\r\nnot seen the MS but infer from the description in HL XXI, 500-3 that\r\nit includes only five of Abraham’s treatises, The Beginning of Wisdom,\r\nNativities, Revolutions, Elections, and Interrogations. At the close of\r\nThe Beginning of Wisdom we are told that it was written down by Obers\r\nde Montdidier from the dictation of Hagins the Jew in the house of Sire\r\nHenri Bate at Malines and finished December 22, 1273.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Peter of Abano’s Latin version.]\r\n\r\nOne MS of Peter of Abano’s version, BN supplem. lat. 151, is partially\r\ndescribed in HL 21, 501. Others which I have examined are BN 7336,\r\nBN 7438, Canon. Misc. 190. I have seen various other MSS noted in\r\ncatalogues and elsewhere, but such notices seldom seem to give a full\r\nand accurate list of the treatises. They were printed in 1507 by Peter\r\nLiechtenstein as noted in Appendix II. All copies which I have seen\r\ncontain at the close of the first treatise, the _Liber Introductorius_\r\nor Beginning of Wisdom, the passage, of which HL 21, 501 has already\r\nquoted the Latin, stating that when Peter of Abano the Paduan found\r\nthis work “in Gallic idiom, through the unskilfulness of the translator\r\nfrom the Hebrew defective in many ways, corrupt, and sometimes poorly\r\narranged and failing to make sense, as far as he could he brought it\r\nback in the Latin tongue to Abraham’s original meaning.” The date is\r\nthen given as 1293. Peter is also usually named as the translator at\r\nthe beginning or end of the other treatises.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Additional treatises in Peter’s version.]\r\n\r\nIn the Latin versions of Abraham’s astrological treatises besides\r\nthe five named by the Histoire Littéraire are found the _Liber\r\nrationum_,[2885] the _Liber luminarium et de cognitione diei\r\ncretici_,[2886] and _Tractatus particulares_, which are really three\r\ntreatises, namely: (1) “Incipit alius tractatus particulare. Incipit\r\ntractatus de partibus horarum in interrogationibus”;[2887] (2)\r\n“Tractatus in tredecim manieribus planetarum”;[2888] and (3) “Tractatus\r\nde significationibus planetarum in duodecim domibus Abrahe.”[2889]\r\nThe _De consuetudinibus in judiciis astrorum et est centiloquium\r\nBethen_, which occurs in the midst of Abraham’s treatises in the MSS,\r\nis probably not by him and is placed last in the 1507 edition. The\r\n_Tractatus particulares_ are not included by Steinschneider in his\r\nlist of Abraham’s astrological writings.[2890]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A Latin translation by Henry Bate.]\r\n\r\nWhile in general the Latin translation of Abraham’s astrological\r\ntreatises is ascribed to Peter, in all the editions and manuscripts\r\nthat I have seen,[2891] one of them, entitled _De mundo vel seculo_\r\nand dealing with conjunctions and revolutions, is ascribed to Henry\r\nBate, the same under whose patronage the French translations were\r\nmade.[2892] It would therefore seem that Peter found Henry Bate’s own\r\nLatin translation of 1281 more satisfactory than the French translation\r\nmade at Bate’s house in 1273,[2893] and did not attempt to revise it.\r\nIn some manuscripts Bate is also credited with a Latin translation of\r\nThe Beginning of Wisdom or _Liber introductorius_, made in 1292.[2894]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Other writings of Henry Bate.]\r\n\r\nThis Henry Bate was called by Pico della Mirandola “a disciple of\r\nAlbertus Magnus.”[2895] In 1274 at Malines and in fulfilment of a\r\npromise made to William of Moerbeke, the noted translator of the\r\nDominican Order and at that time papal chaplain and penitentiary,\r\nwhen they were together in Lyons, Bate composed a treatise on the\r\nastrolabe.[2896] Later Bate also wrote an account of his own horoscope\r\nand destiny.[2897] It gives the year of his birth as 1244. He was a\r\ncanon, doctor of theology, and university professor; and seems to\r\nhave spent his life mainly at Malines, Liège, and Paris. He also\r\nwrote on errors in the Alfonsine astronomical tables.[2898] Another\r\nunpublished work of his is entitled _Speculum divinorum et quorundam\r\nnaturalium_.[2899]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Other works by Abraham.]\r\n\r\nThere were also Latin versions of other astronomical and astrological\r\nworks by Abraham than those translated by Bate or Peter.[2900] One\r\ncannot, however, be sure that “Abraham Judaeus” always refers to\r\nAbraham Avenezra, as there was a translator or translators of the\r\nthirteenth century by that name. Simon Cordo of Genoa was assisted in\r\nhis Latin translation of the medical works of Serapion by an Abraham\r\nJudaeus of Tortosa;[2901] and Alfonso X of Castile employed a Jew named\r\nAbraham in astronomical translation from Arabic into Spanish.[2902] An\r\nAbraham Iudeus of Barcelona translated Haly on Elections from Arabic\r\ninto Latin,[2903] and was perhaps the same as Abraham Bar Chasdai,\r\na rabbi of Barcelona who translated the supposititious Aristotelian\r\nwork _De pomo_ from Arabic into Hebrew, after which Manfred, the\r\nillegitimate son of Emperor Frederick II, translated it or had it\r\ntranslated from Hebrew into Latin.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[2885] Incipit liber de rationibus habrabe avenerze quem transtulit\r\npetrus paduanus....

But it is not quite certain that he even\r\nreceived a call, if we judge from the extant original documents,[2908]\r\na decree issued by the government of Treviso on August 9, 1314, and\r\nletters of the 15th and 16th of that month. The decree indeed aims at\r\nthe institution of professorial chairs in the two laws and medicine\r\n(_phisica_) at Treviso, namely, Ordinary Lecturers in Civil and Canon\r\nLaw, and Extraordinary Lecturers in Civil Law and Medicine. Under each\r\nof these four heads it lists three names, and that of “Master Peter\r\nof Abano” heads those in medicine. But the decree further states that\r\n“the doctors named below” are to be balloted upon, and apparently by\r\nlot,[2909] and thus arranged in order of first, second, and third\r\nchoice. The position is then to be offered to the first one chosen;\r\nif he refuses, to the second; and so on. It is also stated that the\r\nincumbents “are to lecture and teach through three years continuously\r\nafter their arrival,” not for one year. The normal salary is set at\r\nfour hundred petty pounds annually, although the Council of Three\r\nHundred are left some liberty in increasing or diminishing this amount.\r\nMoreover, we have a letter of August sixteenth notifying Peter of\r\nSuzara of his final appointment after he had indicated that he would\r\naccept the election. Similar letters were sent to five others of the\r\ntwelve men named in the decree, and the name of Peter of Abano is not\r\nfound among the five, the professor named in medicine being Henzelerius\r\nor Hengelerius. Either therefore Peter of Abano had not been elected or\r\nhad refused to accept the appointment.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[2904] Bonifazio, _Storia di Trevigi_, 1591, P. 354.\r\n\r\n[2905] Mazzuchelli (1741), p. xxii.\r\n\r\n[2906] Tiraboschi (1775) V, 51 and 156.\r\n\r\n[2907] Colle (1825) III, 133.\r\n\r\n[2908] Verci (1787) VII, _Documenti_, pp. 39-40, 43-4, 46-7 (from\r\nRaccolta Scotti, IV, 376, 342, 388).\r\n\r\n[2909] “... quod infrascripti Doctores per sortem eligantur ... quod\r\nilli qui scripti sunt inferius ad lecturam ordinariam per se sortiri\r\ndebeant unus contra alium ad buffolos et ballotas....

From\r\nthis it was inferred that his annual stipend was either six thousand\r\npounds, or four thousand if reckoned on the basis of an academic year\r\nof eight months. This seemed to show that he was the highest paid\r\nprofessor of his own, not to mention our, age. On turning, however,\r\nto the will as printed by Verci[2910] we discover that the fifteen\r\nhundred pounds represent three years of back pay, and that Peter\r\nfurther bequeaths to the commune of Padua five hundred pounds of small\r\n_denarii_ due on his salary, presumably for the current year.[2911]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Why was it so far in arrears?]\r\n\r\nThis puts an entirely different aspect upon the matter. It not only\r\nshows that Peter’s stipend was scarcely a tithe of what had been\r\nsupposed, although a good salary for the times, as a comparison with\r\nthat offered at Treviso and with the amounts of the other legacies made\r\nby Peter in his will indicates. It also raises the question, why was\r\nthe payment of Peter’s salary some four years in arrears? And why does\r\nPeter make a distinction between five hundred pounds for which he holds\r\npapers (_Bulletas_) from the town officials and the fifteen hundred\r\npounds due him for the previous three years and for which he apparently\r\nhas nothing to show. Is there some question as to his claim for salary\r\nfor those three years or even as to his having been in the Commune’s\r\nemploy? Probably the simplest explanation is that after failing to\r\nreceive his salary for these years Peter took the precaution to get a\r\ndefinite statement concerning it for the fourth. This might also serve\r\nto explain why Treviso had hopes of getting him away from Padua in\r\n1314, and why he stayed on in 1315. The years just preceding 1315 seem\r\nto have been a troublous time for the city of Padua, which incurred a\r\nheavy sentence from the emperor Henry VII, and had wars with Vicenza\r\nand Can Grande, not to mention civil strife such as that of April,\r\n1314, when another Peter--_Judex de Altichino_--was slain with his sons\r\nin the public square by the people, their goods confiscated, and the\r\nfamily banished to the fourth generation.[2912]\r\n\r\nThere seems to be no quarrel between Peter and the Commune of Padua,\r\nfor he goes on in his will to entrust himself, his children, and his\r\nproperty to its tutelage and defense, besides leaving the Commune the\r\ntwo thousand pounds in question. Also as Peter makes his will in Padua,\r\nwhere most of his legatees live, where he still has his residence, and\r\nwhere he intends to be buried, it appears that in May, 1315, he still\r\nis in the employ of that city and has been for years past. So he has\r\nnot yet gone to Treviso or elsewhere. Nor is his bequeathing the two\r\nthousand pounds arrears to the city a sure indication that he does not\r\nintend to teach there any more, either because he expects to die soon,\r\nor to accept a position in another university, or to cease teaching\r\nentirely because of old age. These arrears are an asset and he has to\r\ndispose of them somehow in making his will; he evidently has continued\r\nto teach when one and two years’ pay was owing him, and he may continue\r\nto do so now when three or four years’ salary is in arrears. However,\r\nit must be said that he shows no hope of ever recovering these arrears,\r\nnor is there any evidence that he ever did.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[2910] Which Colle, although he wrote after the publication of Verci’s\r\nwork, did not take the trouble to do. Gloria was apparently the first\r\nto note that the time was three years and not three months.\r\n\r\n[2911] Verci (1787) VII, _Documenti_, 117-8. “Item reliquit Communi\r\nPadue libras quingentas denariorum parvorum quas habere debebat a dicto\r\nCommuni Padue pro suo debito salario de quo habebat Bulletas dominorum\r\nPotestatis Ancianorum et Gastaldionum Communis Padue supradicti.\r\nItem reliquit eidem Communi Padue libras mille et quingentas quas\r\nhabere debebat a dicto Communi Padue pro suo salario de tribus annis\r\nretroactis.”\r\n\r\n[2912] _Chronicon Patavinum ab 1174-1390_ in Muratori, _Antiquitates_\r\n(1741) IV, 1156-7 (covering the years 1311-1315).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX VI\r\n\r\nWHEN DID PETER DIE?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe date of Peter’s death may be placed between May 25, 1315, when\r\nhe made his will, and November 19, 1318, when the record of a legal\r\ntransaction in which his sons were concerned appears to speak of\r\nhim as dead.[2913] It has usually been assumed that he died in 1315\r\nor 1316 and these dates are given in epitaphs,[2914] which, however,\r\nwere composed long afterwards and cannot be accepted as sure proof.\r\nPeter’s making his will has been taken as a sign that he was at\r\ndeath’s door and died almost immediately afterward, but this inference\r\ndoes not seem necessarily to follow either from the will proper or\r\nfrom the accompanying confession of faith which he made on the day\r\npreceding. Arnald of Villanova, it will be recalled, made his will in\r\n1305 but lived on until 1311. Peter concludes his confession of faith\r\nby affirming that such has been his belief in the past, is now, “and\r\nwill be to the very end of his life.”[2915] Unless we assume that this\r\nlast clause is added simply as a matter of form or as a safeguard\r\nagainst the possibility of the Inquisition’s making the charge that\r\nimmediately after his confession Peter became a heretic or relapsed\r\ninto his previous heresy--unless we make such an assumption, which may\r\nbe entirely unwarranted--the natural conclusion is that Peter did not\r\nexpect to die immediately.\r\n\r\nThe language of the will itself points in the same direction. Peter, “a\r\nprovident and discreet man,” contemplating the unstable condition of\r\nhuman nature and noting that “those things which have the appearance of\r\nlasting for a long time” nevertheless “tend visibly toward their end,”\r\nhas decided to meet such perils half-way and happily anticipate the\r\nlast day of life by a will made when in full possession of his senses\r\nand intellectual faculties.[2916] No mention is made of his being\r\nin ill health, unlike another will of the same period quoted in the\r\nsame volume of Verci, in which the testator speaks of himself as “of\r\nsound mind, although afflicted body, not wishing to depart this world\r\nintestate.”[2917]\r\n\r\nOther indications that Peter not only did not die immediately after\r\nmaking his will, but continued to teach and write, are the fairly\r\nstrong evidence and probability that the pope to whom his treatise on\r\npoisons is addressed is John XXII, who was not elected until August 7,\r\n1316; and the dubious assertion in a fifteenth century manuscript that\r\nPeter was acting dean of Montpellier at that time. We might also add\r\nthat a prefatory note in the 1555 edition of the _De venenis_ states\r\nthat he lived to be almost an octogenarian.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[2913] Gloria (1884), p. 587, note 6, “Mill. trec. decimo octavo ind.\r\nprima die decimo nono mens.

Giacosa[2918] says that the treatise is dedicated in some\r\nMSS to Pope Honorius IV, but he does not specify them, and I do not\r\nknow of any such. Where the pope is named, he is either John without\r\nenumeration,[2919] or John XXII.[2920] It is perhaps worth noting that\r\nthere never was any John XX, and that John XXI is sometimes called\r\nJohn XX, and John XXII is called John XXI, but that the converse is\r\nimpossible. In view of this uncertainty in the enumeration, it would\r\nalso not be surprising to find either John XXI or XXII named without\r\nenumeration. Scardeone[2921] in the sixteenth century asserted that\r\nthe _De venenis_ was dedicated to John XXII, although this conflicts\r\nwith his statement that Peter died in 1315. Mazzuchelli[2922] spoke\r\nof an Italian translation in which the pope is called Giacomo. There\r\nnever was a pope so styled, but both Honorius IV and John XXII (called\r\nJohn XXI by Mazzuchelli owing to the error above noted) bore the name\r\nGiacomo before they assumed their pontifical designations. Another\r\ncogent reason for dismissing John XXI (1276-1277) from consideration is\r\nthat Peter at the age of twenty-six or twenty-seven would neither have\r\nadopted the authoritative tone that he employs in the _De venenis_ in\r\naddressing a pope who had himself, as Petrus Hispanus, been a medical\r\nwriter of note, nor have failed to advert to that pope’s own medical\r\nworks.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Inference from a citation of Avenzoar.]\r\n\r\nIn the _De venenis_[2923] Peter cites the Latin translation of a\r\ntreatise by Avenzoar (ʿAbd al Malik ibn Zuhr ibn ʿAbd al Malik, Abu\r\nMarwan) concerning the power of a powdered emerald as an antidote\r\nagainst poison. In the printed editions Avenzoar’s work is referred to\r\nas that translated for Pope Boniface.[2924] If we could only rely upon\r\nthis as Peter’s original wording, it would mean that he was himself\r\naddressing some pope later than Boniface VIII (1294-1303), and so would\r\nsupport the other evidence that the _De venenis_ was addressed to John\r\nXXII. But in at least one manuscript of the _De venenis_ the work of\r\nAvenzoar is said to have been translated “for the Roman people.”[2925]\r\nMoreover, the Latin translation of Avenzoar in question is extant\r\nand in the printed version[2926] we read at the close that it was\r\ntranslated at Venice, August 21, 1281, from Hebrew into Latin by a\r\nmaster of medicine from Padua[2927] with the aid of a Jew named Jacob.\r\nThe work would thus seem to have been translated long before Boniface\r\nbecame pope. In a Paris manuscript,[2928] however, the translator\r\ngives his name as John of Capua, a baptized Jew, of whom we know as a\r\ntranslator of other works from Hebrew into Latin,[2929] and addresses\r\nhis present translation to the archbishop of Braga in Portugal,[2930]\r\nwhom Hartwig believed to be Martin de Oliviera who held that office\r\nfrom 1292 to 1313. Now this John of Capua also translated the work on\r\nDiets of Maimonides, at the suggestion of William of Brescia who was\r\nPope Boniface VIII’s physician, and Hartwig believes that he met the\r\narchbishop of Braga at Rome. But more than this, in a Vienna manuscript\r\nthe translation of Avenzoar is addressed to Pope Boniface VIII\r\nhimself.[2931] Apparently therefore there is justification for Peter\r\nof Abano’s speaking of the work as translated for Boniface VIII. And\r\nwhether it was or not, in any case it was translated at too late a date\r\nfor Peter to have cited it in his _De venenis_, had that treatise been\r\naddressed to Pope John XXI who died in 1277. So if we admit that the\r\n_De venenis_ was addressed to a Pope John, it must have been addressed\r\nto John XXII who became pope on August 7, 1316.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Popes and poisons.]\r\n\r\nReturning for a moment to Boniface VIII, it may be remarked that he was\r\npresumably the pope who, as Peter himself states in the _Conciliator_,\r\nhad protected him from certain persecutors. That there was nothing\r\nstrange in addressing a work on poisons to a pope of that time is shown\r\nby the fact that Ermengard Blasius (or Blasii)[2932] of Montpellier,\r\nphysician of Philip the Fair of France, translated the work of Moses\r\nMaimonides on poisons for Clement V, the predecessor of John XXII, in\r\n1307.[2933] But there is no evidence so far as I know to indicate that\r\nPeter of Abano addressed his work on poisons to Clement V, although\r\nchronologically it is possible.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[2918] P.

We shall\r\ninquire here what real evidence there is. In the _Conciliator_, written\r\nin 1303, occurs a germane statement by Peter himself at the close of\r\na chapter in which he has discussed the determination of periods in\r\nhistory and the rise of new prophets and religions by the courses of\r\nthe stars, and the connection of seven angelic intelligences with the\r\nseven planets. After this somewhat bold indulgence in astrology Peter\r\nconcludes, “So much then has been said as can be comprehended by reason\r\nconcerning this according to the skill of the world’s scholars, in no\r\nway derogating from divine wisdom in what has been written but rather\r\nconfirming it in all points since it alone is truth and life. In this\r\nmatter, however, some mischief-makers, unwilling or rather unable to\r\nhear, for a long time have freely vexed me, from whose hands at last\r\nthe said Truth has laudably snatched me and mine, with the intervention\r\ntoo of an apostolic mandate.”[2934] Before 1303, therefore, Peter’s\r\nastrology had aroused considerable opposition, perhaps at Paris, which\r\nhowever was checked at least for the time being by papal protection,\r\nand to which Peter does not so far as I know allude again in his\r\nsubsequent works.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: His professions of orthodoxy.]\r\n\r\nIn many passages of his works, however, Peter recognizes that the\r\nPeripatetic philosophy and Christian dogma do not agree, and, while\r\nstating the philosophical position, gives his adhesion to the orthodox\r\nFaith.[2935] In the preface to the _Conciliator_ he states that the\r\nwork is divided into three parts in honor of the Trinity. In the\r\n_Addition to Mesuë_ he argues that trust in God is of avail in the art\r\nof medicine. Pious phralses such as _Si deo placet_ and _Deo gratias_\r\noccur with fair frequency in his works. Finally, in his will of 1315,\r\nor rather in a statement made the day before the will was drawn up, he\r\nmakes profession of firm faith in the Trinity, Creed, and articles of\r\nfaith, and declares that he believes “in all respects just as Holy\r\nMother Church believes and teaches,” and that he has always so believed\r\nand will until his last breath. “And if it should be found that he has\r\never said anything contrary to the Faith, he said it not because he\r\nbelieved it, but probably for purposes of disputation.”[2936]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Does his will show fear of the Inquisition?]\r\n\r\nThere is perhaps no sufficient reason for doubting the sincerity and\r\nspontaneity of these professions of faith, but the question arises\r\nwhether Peter did not make this confession of faith in order to\r\ndemonstrate that he was no heretic and so secure the validity of the\r\nwill which he made on the day following. This would be a prudent step\r\non his part if he had any fear of future action by the Inquisition,\r\nsince the property of a heretic who was condemned to life imprisonment\r\nor to the stake was subject to confiscation. Moreover, the number of\r\njudgments of confiscation against deceased persons was “relatively\r\nhigh.”[2937] We now turn to the will itself to inquire if there is\r\nanything in it to suggest fear of the Inquisition on Peter’s part.\r\nThe most, if not the only, extraordinary feature of the will is the\r\nattitude shown by Peter toward his sons. We have seen that three\r\nsurvived him and were concerned in legal transactions in 1318 and 1321.\r\nThere is, however, only one or at most two mentions[2938] of them in\r\nthe will. After a list of legacies for various purposes and to various\r\npersons, including his nephews and grandnieces, and the bequest of\r\ntwo thousand pounds of back salary to the Commune of Padua, the will\r\ncontinues, “Also he has commended himself, his sons, and his property\r\nto the Commune and men of the city of Padua as if it were the tutelage\r\nand infallible defense of their own sons and property.” Then he names\r\nthe executors of his will (_suos fideicommissarios_) and as his heirs\r\n_Jacobum qu. domini Marsilii de Carrara de Padua_ and _Conradum qu.\r\ndomini Bonzanelli da Viguntia_, whom he describes as “trustworthy men\r\nand of eminent virtue and repute.” Jacobus became captain-general of\r\nPadua in 1318.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Gloria’s inference.]\r\n\r\nFrom these passages Gloria concludes that Peter entrusts his body, his\r\nchildren, and his property to the Commune of Padua in order to save\r\nthem from the Inquisition,--his body from being burned after his death,\r\nhis property from being confiscated; and that he names “two rich and\r\npowerful citizens” as his heirs in order to enlist their aid and with\r\nthe secret understanding that they shall later transmit the residue\r\nof his property, after his other legacies are paid, to his children.\r\nIt should, however, be realized that the confiscation of the property\r\nof a heretic was absolute. “Forfeiture occurred _ipso facto_ as soon\r\nas the crime of heresy was committed, the heretic could convey no\r\nlegal title and any assignments which he might have made were void, no\r\nmatter through how many hands the property might have passed.”[2939]\r\nWhether, therefore, Peter’s sons received their inheritance directly\r\nor indirectly, it could be taken from them, if he were condemned as\r\na heretic either before or after his death. On the other hand, there\r\nis this to be said in favor of Gloria’s interpretation of the will.\r\nIf Peter’s property were confiscated as that of a heretic, it would\r\nnaturally be confiscated by the Commune of Padua, the same secular\r\npower to whom he would be handed over for execution in case he were\r\ncondemned to the stake. By making a generous legacy to the city,\r\nby appealing to it for protection of himself and children, and by\r\nnaming leading citizens as his heirs, Peter may have hoped to enlist\r\npublic opinion on his side, to prevent any Paduan from accusing him\r\nof heresy to the Inquisition or supporting such a charge, or, in case\r\nthe Inquisition does condemn him and the city government of Padua does\r\nconfiscate his property, to induce the Commune at least to provide\r\nfor his children. And certainly the sentence in which Peter entrusts\r\nhimself, his children, and his goods to the infallible defense of the\r\nCommune of Padua does not sound as if he meant to disinherit his sons\r\nin favor of other heirs.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Did Peter’s sons inherit his property?]\r\n\r\nThe next question is: what evidence is there to show that the sons ever\r\nreceived their father’s property, if this was his intention? Gloria\r\nholds that Peter’s sons are called his heirs in documents recording\r\nlegal transactions of 1318 and 1321, that consequently he meant them\r\nto be his real heirs when he drew up his will in 1315, and that the\r\nnominal heirs, true to their trust, have duly turned over the estate\r\nafter the funeral expenses and other legacies have been met. If this\r\nlast assumption is true and if Peter’s sons are in 1318 openly called\r\nhis heirs, whereas in 1315 he did not dare to call them his heirs, it\r\nwould appear probable either that there has been in the interval a\r\ntrial for heresy and that Peter has been acquitted, or that there has\r\nbeen no trial and is not likely to be one. But I am not so sure that\r\nthe documents mentioned describe Peter’s sons as _his_ heirs.[2940]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: If so, how?]\r\n\r\nIf, however, they are openly called his heirs in 1318, or if, whether\r\ncalled his heirs or not, they are in possession of his property after\r\nhis death, there are other possible explanations of this than that\r\nthe heirs named in his will of 1315 have voluntarily turned over the\r\nestate to them. Either the will may have been set aside for other\r\nreasons--it will be noted that at its close Peter states, “if it is\r\nnot valid by the law of testaments, let it have force and hold by\r\nthe law of codicils or any other law by which it may the better and\r\nmore efficaciously have force and hold good.”[2941] Or the will may\r\nhave been annulled by the sons, angry at being disinherited, having\r\nthemselves informed against their father as a heretic. For note the one\r\nexception to the law that the confiscation of the property of a heretic\r\nis absolute even at the expense of his innocent widow and children.\r\n“Frederick II and Innocent IV both decreed that children could inherit\r\ntheir father’s property, if they denounced him for heresy.”[2942] But\r\nthis sensational possibility[2943] seems to be excluded by another\r\nbit of evidence which Gloria did not note but which supports his\r\ninterpretation of the will. In 1325 Marsilius de Carrara, nephew of the\r\nJacobus named as one of Peter of Abano’s heirs and almost as prominent\r\nas his uncle in the town politics, was knocked off his horse and\r\ntrodden under foot in a street fight in Padua, and was in danger of his\r\nlife, but was helped to his feet by “Benvenutus of Abano, son of master\r\nPeter, and others of his men.”[2944] Thus whatever disposition was\r\nmade of Peter’s property, his nominal heirs and his sons seem to have\r\nremained on good terms.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Burning of Peter’s bones for heresy.]\r\n\r\nIf Peter’s children were provided for, there is evidence that the men\r\nof Padua were not equally successful in protecting his corpse from the\r\nInquisition. Thomas of Strasburg, Prior-General of the Augustinian\r\nFriars from 1345 to 1357, in his _Commentary on the Sentences_[2945]\r\ncalls Peter a heretic, although he admits that he was a most capable\r\nphysician. Thomas affirms that Peter denied the miracles by which\r\nChrist and the saints raised the dead, arguing that men who were\r\nafflicted by a certain disease often fell into a trance for three\r\ncomplete revolutions of the sky. And when asked if Lazarus was not in\r\nthe tomb four days, he would say that it was only for three full days\r\nsince the first and fourth days were incomplete. Thomas does not affirm\r\nthat Peter ventured to deny the resurrection of Christ Himself, but\r\nconcludes his allusion to Peter by saying, “But in this his iniquity he\r\nwas deceived and received the reward of his error. For I was present\r\nwhen in the city of Padua his bones were burned for these and his other\r\nerrors.” The inference which has been drawn from this brief statement\r\nis that at some time after Peter’s death his bones were disinterred and\r\nburned. This much may perhaps be accepted as the fact, since Thomas\r\nasserts he was an eye-witness, but such gossipy reminiscence as this by\r\nmedieval monks and friars, especially when heretics or saints are the\r\ntheme, is notoriously unreliable, as Salimbene and the astounding yarns\r\nin Thomas of Cantimpré’s work on bees show in the thirteenth century.\r\nAt any rate Thomas of Strasburg gives no hint that the “other errors”\r\nof Peter of Abano were connected with magic or astrology. Indeed Thomas\r\ndisplays a considerable faith in astrology himself in other passages\r\nof this work we have cited.[2946] He asserts that the sky itself has a\r\nreal action on inferior objects except for free will. Upon it the stars\r\ncannot act directly but they may affect it indirectly owing to the\r\nradical union in us of sense appetite and intellectual appetite.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The account of Michael Savonarola.]\r\n\r\nA century later Michael Savonarola supplements with further detail\r\nthe general impression of trouble between Peter and at least a certain\r\nparty in the church which we obtained from Abano’s own statement and\r\nfrom Thomas of Strasburg, and suggests that Peter’s inclination toward\r\nmagic, or at least reputation for magic, led the Dominican inquisitor\r\nto denounce him as a heretic at Paris and try to bring him to prison\r\nand the flames. “But he was held in so great veneration by royal\r\nmajesty and the entire university that means were not supplied the\r\ninquisitor to take him.” Savonarola goes on to say that, when Peter\r\nlearned of this, he induced the king and university to call a council\r\nof doctors of Holy Scripture, whom he convinced by forty-five arguments\r\nthat not he but the Dominicans were heretics. “And after sentence had\r\nbeen so given,” continues Savonarola, “if the story is to be believed,\r\nit was brought about that the Dominicans were driven from Paris as\r\nheretics and exiles and were unable to reside there for thirty-two\r\nyears.”[2947] But of course we do not believe any such story, which is\r\nmentioned nowhere else, and therefore Savonarola’s entire account has\r\nto be suspiciously regarded as “a story.”\r\n\r\nSavonarola proceeds to say, however, that then the case was appealed\r\nto Rome and that by intervention of the pope peace was at last made\r\nbetween Peter and the Dominicans; and that in his testament, “which is\r\nheld in great veneration by many Paduans,” Peter left his body to be\r\ninterred among the Dominicans as a sign to God and the world how he\r\nhad kept the peace with them. As a matter of fact, however, it is in\r\nthe church of St. Anthony the Confessor belonging to the Friars Minor\r\nor Franciscans of Padua that Peter’s will directs he shall be buried,\r\nwhile two Franciscans and no Dominicans are listed among the witnesses\r\nto his confession of faith. Again therefore we find Savonarola’s\r\naccount unreliable. He concludes, “But the Dominican Inquisitor, full\r\nof venom and breaking the truce to which he had sworn--an action the\r\nmore detestable in a clergyman, in the silence of the night opened\r\nthe sepulcher, burned the body, and gave the ashes to the wind. O\r\nunspeakable crime!”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Scardeone’s account.]\r\n\r\nAs we recede further from Peter of Abano’s own time to Scardeone in\r\nthe sixteenth century, more specific details concerning his life\r\naccumulate. Scardeone perverts Savonarola’s statement that Peter’s\r\nastrological predictions won him a reputation as a magician and that\r\nthis got him into trouble with the Dominicans at Paris, into the\r\nassertion that Peter’s devotion to mathematical disciplines at Paris\r\ncaused him on his return to Padua to be suspected of magic. He adds\r\nthat a rival physician, Peter of Reggio, jealous of Abano’s science and\r\nfame, reported him to the Inquisition as a heretic and necromancer.\r\nThat the Inquisition twice instituted proceedings against him: in 1306,\r\nwhen three illustrious men, whom Scardeone mentions by name,[2948] were\r\nhis patrons and, since nothing was proved against him at the trial, he\r\nwas freed from this calumny; and again in 1315, when he died during the\r\ntrial--Scardeone, however, says nothing to suggest that this was due to\r\napplication of torture--and was buried in the church of St. Anthony.\r\nThe Inquisition, however, went on to condemn him upon the basis of\r\nhis writings, but meanwhile either his friends or his housekeeper\r\nMarietta had removed and hidden his body, which the inquisitors had to\r\nbe content to burn in effigy. “This,” coolly continues Scardeone, “is\r\nwhy Thomas of Strasburg wrote that he saw the bones of Peter of Abano\r\nburned in the square of Padua.” Thus Scardeone not merely makes new\r\nassertions based upon no one knows what, but contradicts statements\r\nof Savonarola who was nearer to the events and Thomas of Strasburg\r\nwho claims to be an eye-witness. It is on Scardeone’s account,\r\nnevertheless, that most modern allusions to Peter of Abano and his fate\r\nare based.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Naudé’s statement.]\r\n\r\nIt is hardly worth while to pursue the matter further in later writers\r\nexcept perhaps to note an inscription upon a statue of Peter of Abano\r\nin Padua which Naudé mentions in 1625.[2949] “Petrus Aponus of Padua,\r\nmost learned in philosophy and medicine, and on that account winner\r\nof the name of Conciliator; in astrology indeed so skilled that he\r\nincurred suspicion of magic, and, falsely accused of heresy, was\r\nacquitted.” Thus only one trial is mentioned and that resulting in an\r\nacquittal.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[2934] _Conciliator_, Diff. 9.\r\n\r\n[2935] See, for instance, _Conciliator_, Diffs. 9, 13, 64, 135, 156.\r\n\r\n[2936] Verci (1787) VII, _Documenti_, 118-9.\r\n\r\n[2937] CE, “Inquisition.”\r\n\r\n[2938] The doubtful passage is, “_Item reliquit domine Marie quondam\r\nBartolomei a Sancto Gregorio de contrata Sancte Lucie de Padua libras\r\ncentum parvorum et pro quolibet anno libras vigintiquinque parvorum pro\r\nsuo labore dispensandi domum et pueros suos dum vixerit._”\r\n\r\nThe question is, does Peter leave Maria one hundred petty pounds\r\noutright and an annuity of twenty-five pounds “for her labor in\r\nmanaging the house and her children as long as she lives,” or “for\r\n(i.e., in return for) her labor in managing the house and his children\r\nas long as she lives”?\r\n\r\nThe words “_dum vixerit_” must mean “as long as she lives,” because\r\nthey are similarly used in the next sentence of another recipient of an\r\nannuity. Could they mean, “while he (i.e., Peter) lived,” there would\r\nbe less difficulty in translating “_pueros suos_” as “his children.”\r\n\r\nLater legend (Scardeone, 1560, p. 201) stated that Peter had a\r\nhousekeeper named Marietta who saved his corpse from the Inquisition\r\nby hiding it for a time. It is also possible that Maria was Peter’s\r\nmistress as well as housekeeper, and that the “_pueros suos_” were\r\n“their children.”\r\n\r\n[2939] H. C. Lea, _A History of the Inquisition in the Middle Ages_, I,\r\n520.\r\n\r\n[2940] Again it is a question of the translation of a reflexive pronoun.\r\n\r\nIn the passage, “_Benvenutus q. fil. mag. Petri fisici olim ser\r\nConstancii de Abano pro se et vice Petri et Zifredi suorum fratrum q.\r\neiusd. d. Petri et suorum heredum vendidit_” (Gloria, p. 587), does\r\n“_suorum heredum_” mean Peter’s heirs or, like “_suorum fratrum_,”\r\nBenvenuto’s heirs?\r\n\r\nThe other document of 1321, “... _in villa Abani coheret a mane\r\nBenvenutus q. magistri Petri de Abano cum Petro et Zufredo fratribus\r\nsuis_,” shows that they have just inherited some property in Abano\r\ntogether, but scarcely from their father who has been dead at least\r\nthree years according to the other document.\r\n\r\n[2941] Verci, VII, _Documenti_, p. 118, “et si non posset valere iure\r\ntestamenti valeat et teneat iure codicillorum vel quocumque alio iure\r\nquo melius et efficacius valere et tenere possit.”\r\n\r\n[2942] E. Vacandard, _The Inquisition_, 1908, p. 246.\r\n\r\n[2943] It is also barely possible that Peter, in drawing up his will,\r\nhad planned to have his sons denounce him in order to inherit.\r\n\r\n[2944] _Chronicon Patavinum_, anno 1325, in Muratori, _Antiquitates_\r\n(1778) XII, 252.\r\n\r\nIt is worth noting that the Chronicle is silent as to any heresy trial\r\nor punishment of “master Peter.”\r\n\r\n[2945] _Thomae ab Argentina, Commentaria in IIII libros sententiarum,\r\nGenuae_, 1585, Book IV, Distinctio 37 and 38, Article 4, which in this\r\nedition is vol.

This passage has been incorrectly cited\r\nby Colle and others, so that I had difficulty in finding it, especially\r\nsince it is buried under the heading, “De impedimento praecedentis\r\nconjugii.”\r\n\r\n[2946] Liber II, Dist. 14, Quaestio I and Artic. III.\r\n\r\n[2947] Perhaps Savonarola uses the word “Dominicans” here merely in the\r\nsense of inquisitors.\r\n\r\n[2948] One of them, Jacopo Alvarotto, was one of the witnesses to\r\nPeter’s profession of faith in 1315 and one of the executors named in\r\nhis will.\r\n\r\n[2949] _Apologie_, pp. 386-7.

If so, this is mainly for two reasons; first, that his poem\r\n_l’Acerba_ has been associated with the study of Dante; second, that he\r\nwas condemned by the Inquisition and burned at the stake in Florence in\r\n1327. Doubtless Cecco should receive some attention in the histories\r\nboth of literature and science as one who was both an Italian poet\r\nand a Latin teacher and writer of astronomy and astrology. But his\r\nworks and personality would perhaps have been long since forgotten\r\nbut for the fact that his learned poem, _l’Acerba_, was taken to be\r\nan invidious parody of Dante’s _Divine Comedy_, and that both it and\r\nhis astrological work in Latin were ordered to be burned at the same\r\ntime with himself, while all persons retaining copies of them were to\r\nbe excommunicated. Recently, it is true, it has been held that Cecco\r\nimitated Dante out of admiration for him and not from any desire\r\nto cast aspersion upon the _Divine Comedy_,[2950] but in any case\r\ntheir names have long been coupled. As for the condemnation by the\r\nInquisition, its chief effect seems to have been to raise a rather\r\nordinary astrologer to the position of a martyr for science and a\r\nreproach to the medieval church. Many apologies for and eulogies of\r\nCecco have been penned through the centuries since, while a few writers\r\nhave tried to justify the action of the Inquisition, to discredit\r\nCecco, and to question his scientific reputation.[2951] Certainly the\r\ncondemnation by the Inquisition seems to have advertised rather than\r\nrepressed his writings, since not only has the poem _l’Acerba_ survived\r\nbut also two works on astrology. Of these three the two that the\r\nInquisition probably meant to forbid were both in print before 1500 and\r\nthe Protestant Revolt. The third, which the Inquisitors seem to have\r\noverlooked, was also neglected by publishers until the present century.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: An astrologer burned by the Inquisition.]\r\n\r\nHitherto in our survey of medieval learning, more particularly of the\r\ntwelfth and thirteenth centuries, we have found little or no evidence\r\nin support of the old view, or rather assumption, that every medieval\r\nscientist was persecuted by the church. Signs of a theological party\r\nhostile to the growing interest in natural science we have seen, but\r\nmuch more evidence of this growing interest itself, and that too among\r\nbishops, friars, Franciscan as well as Dominican, and even popes. We\r\nhave seen that the scientific attitude of William of Conches prevailed\r\nin the long run, that it is very doubtful if Roger Bacon was in any\r\nsense persecuted by the church for devotion to natural science,\r\nand that Peter of Abano did not have to die in order to escape the\r\nInquisition but that it had to wait until after his death before it\r\ncould do him any harm. But now in Cecco d’Ascoli we come at last, and\r\nit is not until the fourteenth century, to a well authenticated case of\r\nan astrologer of some learning being put to death through the agency\r\nof the Inquisition. This makes his writings the more important for us\r\nto note, although we do not find their contents such as to entitle him\r\nto any high rank as a natural scientist.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Works by Cecco to be considered here.]\r\n\r\nIt is hard to see any reason for the condemnation of _l’Acerba_ by the\r\nInquisition except that it was written by Cecco. Its superstition is so\r\nslight as not to call for notice here, nor is its natural science more\r\nremarkable than that of other vernacular poems such as the _Romance\r\nof the Rose_. Our discussion will center about his two extant Latin\r\nworks which are in the form of commentaries upon the _Sphere_ of\r\nSacrobosco[2952] and the _Principia_ of Alcabitius.[2953] Both seem to\r\nbe in the form of class-room lectures and were presumably delivered\r\nby Cecco at Bologna. As we shall see, it is reasonably certain that\r\nthe Latin work condemned by the Inquisition was the commentary on the\r\nSphere and not that on Alcabitius, although why the latter should be\r\noverlooked when the innocuous _l’Acerba_ was condemned is difficult\r\nto explain except by the usual ignorance and stupidity of censors and\r\npersecutors. It is unlikely that either of the Latin works has been\r\naltered from Cecco’s original either by himself or others in order to\r\nrender it less objectionable from the theological point of view, after\r\nthe Inquisition had condemned his book on astrology _in toto_. It would\r\nbe more likely if anything to be touched up in the other direction. In\r\nany case these two works are what we have from Cecco’s pen to show what\r\nwere the views of an astrologer condemned by the Inquisition.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Other sources.]\r\n\r\nWe have, it is true, some documentary evidence other than Cecco’s own\r\nworks to show what his views were and why he was condemned by the\r\nInquisition, but it is not very satisfactory. Boffito, who in recent\r\ntimes has made the most specialized study of Cecco d’Ascoli and his\r\nworks, editing the commentary on Alcabitius hitherto unprinted and\r\ninvestigating the problem, “Why was the astrologer Cecco d’Ascoli\r\ncondemned to be burned?”[2954] accepts outside of Cecco’s own writings\r\nonly two sources as at all original and reliable, namely, the account\r\nin Giovanni Villani’s contemporary chronicle[2955] and a Latin\r\nmanuscript in the Riccardian library at Florence[2956] which contains a\r\nsummary of the inquisitorial sentence against Cecco. This manuscript is\r\non paper and I should say is certainly not earlier than the fifteenth\r\ncentury. Boffito views with suspicion the longer sentence in Italian\r\nwhich was reproduced by Cantù[2957] and made use of in Lea’s _History\r\nof the Inquisition_,[2958] since it is not found earlier than in a\r\nmanuscript of the seventeenth century.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The sentence by the Inquisition.]\r\n\r\nAccording to the Riccardian manuscript Cecco’s astrology was the\r\nreason, or at least the pretext, for his condemnation, but it does\r\nnot make clear just what was found objectionable in his astrological\r\nteaching. It brings out further, however, that he was not put to death\r\nfor a first offense but was burned at Florence as a relapsed heretic\r\non the ground that he had violated the terms of a previous sentence\r\nimposed upon him by the inquisitor at Bologna. In 1324 the Bolognese\r\ninquisitor had found Cecco guilty of improper utterances concerning\r\nthe Catholic Faith and had imposed upon him a penance of fifteen days\r\nof confession, daily recital of thirty Paternosters and as many Ave\r\nMarias, occasional fasting for a year, and the hearing every Sabbath\r\nof a sermon by the friars. He furthermore took from Cecco “all his\r\nastrological books, great and small,” forbade him ever again to teach\r\nastrology at Bologna or elsewhere, publicly or privately, deprived him\r\nindefinitely of his professorial chair and doctor’s degree, and fined\r\nhim seventy pounds Bolognese. Taken altogether, this sentence, while\r\nit did not condemn Cecco to death, would seem to have deprived him\r\nrather effectually of future means of livelihood. Three years later the\r\ninquisitor at Florence received the account of the foregoing process\r\nagainst Cecco at Bologna, summoned him before himself, pronounced him\r\na heretic, and handed him over to the secular arm to be burned at\r\nthe stake. This part of the sentence was duly executed by the ducal\r\n_Vicarius_, Lord Jacob of Brescia. It was further decreed that Cecco’s\r\nastrological book in Latin and his poem _l’Acerba_ in Italian should\r\nbe burned and that all persons retaining copies of them should be\r\nexcommunicated.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Villani’s account.]\r\n\r\nVillani adds a number of further details. He states that it was the\r\n_Commentary on the Sphere_ which had caused Cecco’s condemnation at\r\nBologna, that he had been forbidden to make further use of it, and\r\nthat at Florence it was charged that he had violated this prohibition.\r\nBut Cecco denied this and attributed his arrest at Florence to the\r\nhostility of a Friar Minor who was both bishop of Aversa and chancellor\r\nto Charles of Calabria, who was at that time duke of Florence and whose\r\nastrologer Cecco seems to have become after leaving Bologna. In this\r\nnew position, Villani says, Cecco had made many true predictions of\r\npolitical events, but although a great astrologer he was a vain man and\r\nof worldly life. The friar-bishop-chancellor regarded Cecco’s presence\r\nat Florence as court astrologer as an abomination. Villani, however,\r\nlike Cecco himself, does not appear to regard his practicing astrology\r\nat Florence as necessarily a violation of the decree of the inquisitor\r\nat Bologna; but if the Riccardian manuscript correctly reproduces the\r\nBologna sentence, Cecco would certainly seem to have violated it.\r\nVillani volunteers more information than the Riccardian manuscript as\r\nto the respects in which Cecco’s teaching or practice of astrology\r\nwas found objectionable. He makes the general assertion, which is too\r\nvague to be of much value, that Cecco was too bold in exercising his\r\nscience in things prohibited and untrue, “since the influence of the\r\nstars does not constrain of necessity” nor against human free will and\r\ndivine prescience. Villani, indeed, perhaps added this qualification,\r\nafter having stated that Cecco made many true political predictions, in\r\norder to save himself from possible censure. But he more specifically\r\nstates that Cecco ascribed the force of necessity to the stars; that\r\nin his treatise on the _Sphere_ he asserted that there were evil\r\nspirits generated in the sky who could be coerced by incantations under\r\ncertain constellations to perform many marvels; and that he taught\r\nthat Christ came to earth in accordance with the will of God and with\r\nthe principles of astrology, and ought from his nativity to live with\r\nHis disciples _come poltrone_ and to die the death that He did, while\r\nAntichrist would come according to the courses of the planets in rich\r\nraiment and power. Cecco also, Villani vaguely adds, taught “many other\r\nidle things and contrary to the Faith.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The later manuscripts.]\r\n\r\nThe later manuscripts incorporate these charges of Villani in the\r\ninquisitorial sentence against Cecco, using suspiciously similar\r\nwording in the passage concerning Christ and Antichrist, and charging\r\nthat Cecco has taught his work on the _Sphere_ in the schools contrary\r\nto his promise and oath. These manuscripts further assert that Cecco\r\nhas confessed to teaching publicly that men born under certain\r\nconstellations must necessarily be rich or poor or decapitated, that\r\nGod would not change the course of nature, and that in the fourth and\r\neighth sections[2959] of his _Commentary on the Sphere_ he said that\r\nunder certain constellations happy divine men would be born like Moses,\r\nHermes, Merlin, and Simon Magus. Like Villani the later manuscripts\r\nmention Cecco’s political predictions at Florence and state that he\r\nhad prophesied concerning “the Bavarian.”[2960] They also mention\r\nthe stress laid by Cecco upon the importance of the constellations\r\nthat cities are founded under. Such of the statements of these late\r\nmanuscripts[2961] concerning Cecco’s astrological teachings as are not\r\nfound in Villani will be found to rest upon certain passages in his\r\nown works or upon a misapprehension of them.[2962] They also mention\r\nhis _Commentary on Alcabitius_, whereas the older form of the sentence\r\ncondemns only one Latin book on astrology by him. Another suspicious\r\ncircumstance about the longer form of inquisitorial sentence preserved\r\nin these late manuscripts is that the Inquisition is represented as\r\nitself condemning Cecco to death[2963] instead of handing him over to\r\nthe secular arm.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Astrology for cities.]\r\n\r\nLet us next turn to Cecco’s two commentaries in Latin and see what\r\nfoundation there is in them for the astrological teachings ascribed to\r\nhim by Villani and the longer form of inquisitorial sentence preserved\r\nonly in very late and suspiciously worded manuscripts. It is true that\r\nCecco emphasizes the control exercised by the stars over the fate\r\nof cities. The laying of the first stone of a city is a moment as\r\ninfluential over all its future history as is the date of conception in\r\nthe case of an individual. Romans and Tuscans are so corrupt because of\r\nthe ascendancy of Venus over them, the Lombards are scientific through\r\nthe influence of Mercury.[2964] If cities are to endure, they should be\r\nbuilt under the fixed signs.[2965] It is best for a man to live in a\r\ncity with the same guiding star as his own planet.[2966]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The fate of individuals.]\r\n\r\nIn the notes which I took on the astrological statements in Cecco’s\r\ncommentaries there seems to be no single direct assertion that\r\nunder certain constellations men _must necessarily_ be rich or poor\r\nor decapitated. Cecco does tell his students, however, “You ought\r\nto know another thing, that when Jupiter is in the signs of Mars,\r\nforsooth Aries or Scorpion, the person born will be bound with the\r\ngirdle of poverty, infamous, and injured by the powerful.”[2967] The\r\nword “decapitated” perhaps is reminiscent of an anecdote which Cecco\r\ntells in discussing the fulfilment of dreams and their dependence on\r\nthe constellations. A certain malefactor went to a meadow with his\r\nassociates with a scythe to cut down grass and saw beetles rolling up\r\ndung in the road. This reminded him of a dream which he had had the\r\nnight before that these beetles would decapitate him, and he started\r\nin to kill them. But as he struck at them with the handle of the\r\nscythe, the blade which was over his own neck cut off his head. “And\r\nthe moon was in Taurus in conjunction with the fixed star which is\r\ncalled Aldebaran; such is the story told me by my master whom may God\r\npardon.”[2968] This conjunction, however, would seem to have been that\r\nprevailing when the malefactor had his dream and not the constellation\r\nunder which he was born. Cecco in another passage, however, not only\r\ncites Zael to the effect that a horoscope when Mars is lord of the\r\nascendant and in a favorable angle of the sky bestows power and dignity\r\nalong with impiety and the greatest cruelty, and, unless he is regarded\r\nby some favorable planet, will cause the possessor of the horoscope\r\nto lose his power soon; but Cecco also adduces the recent tyrant of\r\nAscoli, John Venibene, as a specific example who ruled for three years\r\nvery cruelly and then was expelled and died abroad.[2969] In the case,\r\non the other hand, of a constellation under which are born lords of the\r\nwhole earth, such as emperors, kings, and princes, Cecco warns that the\r\nsons born to peasants in this constellation will not become kings but\r\nsimply leaders among men of their class, “since the intractability of\r\nthe material weakens the celestial force” and “the vices and virtues\r\nof the parents are transmitted to their heirs.”[2970] Elsewhere he\r\nstates that certain planets called superior are especially appropriated\r\nto kings, nobles, and magistrates, while the inferior planets signify\r\nconcerning the populace.[2971]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Influence of stars and signs.]\r\n\r\nCecco grants that the celestial bodies are inanimate but holds that\r\nby virtue of their substances and the mediation of the intelligences\r\nmoving them they “have properties in different parts of the sky in\r\nwhich they are said to rejoice and sadden effectively in us, that is,\r\nby disposing us to good and to evil.”[2972] Cecco believes that each\r\nherb has its appropriate planet and sign, and that doctors should be\r\ncareful to note the positions of planets in administering herbs.[2973]\r\nThe parts of the human body and regions of the globe he also parcels\r\nout among the signs.[2974] In connection with the common topic of the\r\ninfluence of the stars upon the formation of the child in the womb he\r\nmakes the less common observation that sometimes the influence of the\r\nstars is too strong, as is seen in the case of infants who talk when\r\nonly two months old or have marvelous discretion beyond their years--or\r\nrather, months--and die young.[2975]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: How mind and soul are affected]\r\n\r\nThe heavens influence the human mind as well as body, therefore.\r\nThe stars alter the elements, through these our bodies, and through\r\nthese our souls.[2976] Certain signs of the zodiac are called human\r\nor rational “because they dispose man to reason” and “he will possess\r\neloquence mingled with reason.” A person who is born under one of the\r\nvicious and tortuous signs, namely, the ram, crab, bull, scorpion, and\r\ngoat, will have a tortuous and vicious disposition, plotting evil and\r\ndetracting from others, such a person as the physician Gualfridinus, by\r\nwhich name, as Boffito has already suggested, Dino del Garbo, the noted\r\nmedical writer of Florence, is probably indicated. When the moon is in\r\none of the common signs, Gemini, Virgo, Sagittarius, or Pisces, persons\r\nwho make advances to you are liable to prove fraudulent; marriages\r\ncontracted then are liable to be dissolved; if one escapes from prison,\r\nit will be only to be retaken; but if one is accused of some crime, he\r\nwill soon be acquitted; and so on. In some signs secrets will be kept,\r\nin others immediately revealed. When the moon is in the first _facies_\r\nof Scorpion, all news reports are false.[2977] The influence of the\r\nstars explains the puzzling fact, concerning which his fellow-townsmen\r\nof Ascoli have often questioned Cecco, why a man will choose a\r\nsilly girl of low birth as his wife rather than another who is more\r\nbeautiful, noble, and intelligent. The answer is that when the stars of\r\ntwo persons come into certain positions relative to each other, love\r\nwhich cannot be dissolved except by death results, regardless of beauty\r\nand social rank.[2978]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The stars and dreams.]\r\n\r\nCecco also ascribes the prophetic quality of dreams to astrological\r\ninfluence, which permits the union of the soul of the dreamer with\r\nthe superior intelligences or spirits of the sky. Such revelation is,\r\nhowever, impressed upon the soul of the dreamer “under some similitude\r\nor figure.” Dreams come true when the moon is in the fixed signs,\r\nTaurus, Leo, Aquarius, and Scorpio; when the moon is in the common\r\nsigns, dreams are partly true and partly false. The length of time to\r\nelapse before the dream is fulfilled can also often be determined.\r\nCecco says that “minds ill-constituted and false and homicidal do not\r\nhave true dreams because they are indisposed to receive the action\r\nof the intelligences.” Robbers and homicides may, however, have true\r\ndreams prophetic of their own deaths as in the tale of the malefactor,\r\nthe beetles, and the scythe already recounted, and in the case of a\r\nnative of Ascoli whom Cecco knew personally and “who was named Angelus\r\nand consequently was a devil.” Dreaming when the moon was in Leo that\r\nhe would be hanged in Roman territory, he became so frightened that he\r\nturned friar, but after two years was dismissed from the Order, went to\r\nViterbo, robbed a man, and was there hanged for it.[2979]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Astrological images.]\r\n\r\nCecco alludes to astrological images twice in his commentary on the\r\n_De principiis_ of Alcabitius. To illustrate how images work which are\r\nmade as love charms, or to gain honor, and the like, he states that if\r\nan image for purposes of love is made in the hour of Venus when that\r\nplanet is in Pisces or in Taurus, as the tin is poured out it acquires\r\nunder the moulding influence of that constellation the due proportion\r\nof the elements essential to produce the desired property.[2980] Later\r\nCecco tells us of an image which Vergil made at Naples to drive away\r\nflies. When the second _facies_ of Aquarius is in the ascendant an\r\nimage of a fly should be engraved on the stone in a ring.[2981] In\r\nhis _Commentary on the Sphere_ Cecco even goes so far as to tell how\r\nto construct an astronomical image which will enable one to receive\r\nresponses from demons.[2982]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Did Cecco deny human free will?]\r\n\r\nReturning to the charges made against Cecco’s astrological teaching by\r\nVillani and the later manuscripts, especially the assertion that he\r\nascribed necessity to the stars, we have to note that, although many of\r\nthe astrological teachings just listed may seem to ascribe something\r\nclosely approaching to necessity to the stars, nevertheless Cecco\r\nexpressly asserted that he believed in freedom of the will. Many of the\r\nstatements from his commentaries which we have thus far presented are\r\ncited by him from Ptolemy, Hermes, Zaël and other astrological writers,\r\nand perhaps are not always to be taken as his own opinion, especially\r\nwhen he quotes Hermes as saying, “The heavens are the cause of moral\r\nvirtues and of all.”[2983] At any rate he now informs his students\r\nthat according to “our and the true Faith” the circle of the zodiac,\r\n“though it may be the cause of life, yet is not the cause of our will\r\nor intellect except as a tendency (_nisi dispositive_), and so I hold\r\nand truly believe, although other astrologers hold the contrary, saying\r\nthat all things which are generated and corrupted and renovated in\r\nthe inferior world of generation and corruption have efficient causes\r\nin the superior world which is ungenerated and incorruptible.... That\r\nargument I will overthrow in my glosses to the _Centiloquium_”[2984]--a\r\nwork by Cecco which seems to have been lost or never completed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Founders of new religions said to be born of incubi and\r\nsuccubi at astrological periods.]\r\n\r\nThe charge that in his _Commentary on the Sphere_ Cecco said that\r\nunder certain constellations happy divine men would be born like\r\nMoses, Hermes, Merlin, and Simon Magus, and that Christ and\r\nAntichrist were alike under the rule of the stars, appears from the\r\ntext of the Commentary as it has reached us to be an unjust one.\r\nCecco, it is true, quotes Hipparchus in the book on hierarchies of\r\nspirits to the effect that in the _coluri_, or circles whose purpose\r\naccording to Sacrobosco is to distinguish the solstice and equinox,\r\nthere are incubi and succubi by whose virtue there are born in a\r\nmajor conjunction as if from the deity men who seem divine and who\r\nestablish religions in the world and work miracles. Such a man was\r\nMerlin and such an one will be Antichrist who will be conceived by a\r\nvirgin and work many miracles.[2985] Of Antichrist Cecco promises to\r\nsay more at the close of his lecture and he there quotes a treatise\r\nby Zoroaster on quarter-revolutions of the eighth sphere. According\r\nto this Pseudo-Zoroaster, whenever the eighth sphere completes one\r\nquarter of a revolution, which happens once in twelve thousand years,\r\nthere are born by the virtue of incubi and succubi men supported by\r\ndivinity who introduce new religions and by whose death even the\r\nheaven is perturbed. At the end of twelve thousand years the Mosaic\r\nlaw was terminated thus by the Christian religion, and “ours would\r\nbe terminated in this way by Antichrist.”[2986] But Cecco does not\r\nnecessarily subscribe to these statements of Hipparchus and Zoroaster.\r\nIndeed he has already declared the art of the latter contrary to the\r\nChristian faith and he now continues, “Whence that beast Zoroaster and\r\nsome following him say that Christ was born under the dominion of those\r\nquarter-revolutions from the virtue of incubi and succubi, of whom I\r\nhave spoken to you above, but it seems horrible to me even to write\r\nsuch words.”[2987]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Birth of Christ and darkness during His passion were both\r\nmiraculous.]\r\n\r\nCecco goes on to affirm that “Christ our Lord” was the true son of\r\nGod who came into the glorious Virgin and was not made by the nature\r\nof the celestial bodies. That He rather was the Maker of celestial\r\nnatures many things show us. One is that the Magi, who were superior\r\nastrologers and acquainted with the secrets of universal nature, adored\r\nhim as king and son of God, seeing this in the star which appeared to\r\nthem with the figure of a crowned child beneath it.[2988] Cecco also\r\nargues that the period of darkness during Christ’s passion was a true\r\nmiracle and not due to a natural eclipse, nor to the interposition of a\r\ncomet called Milex, nor to the occult virtue of the stone heliotrope.\r\nThe comet Milex is supposed to presage religious change and injury to\r\nkings and potentates, but Cecco argues that its interposition would\r\nnot cut off the sun’s light and further that it is not found at the\r\naltitude necessary to interpose. The stone heliotrope is green with\r\nblood-colored drops, and when it is placed in a shell full of water in\r\nthe rays of the sun, vapors arise from it which obscure the horizon\r\nin that city. Cecco does not dispute this occult virtue in the gem,\r\nwhich is commonly called “orfanella” and which renders a man invisible\r\nby affecting the eyes of others. But he argues that the eclipse\r\nduring Christ’s passion was universal and not confined to the city of\r\nJerusalem. Some say that an interposition of Venus and Mercury caused\r\nthe darkness, but Cecco affirms that this would be astronomically\r\nimpossible and in itself a miracle and subversion of natural order.\r\nCecco, however, adds that while miraculous, the eclipse was also in a\r\nsense natural, since God is the First and Universal Cause and can alter\r\nthe heavens which are a secondary universal cause.[2989]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Christian qualification of Albumasar.]\r\n\r\nCecco also pretends that where Albumasar speaks of _creatio_ as the\r\nwork of the stars, he must really mean _generatio_, since the act\r\nof creation pertains to God alone, although generation is under the\r\nstars.[2990] As for Albumasar’s aphorism, “If anyone asks anything\r\nof God when the head of the dragon is in conjunction with Jupiter\r\nand the moon in mid-sky, his prayer will be fulfilled”--which Peter\r\nof Abano said he had tested twice with success; Cecco declares that\r\nit is not proper to interpret this as meaning that prayers to God\r\nwill be infallibly answered in certain constellations, but that the\r\nword _deus_ is to be taken here as indicating the king or other chief\r\nmagistrate in the state.[2991] Thus Cecco seems at considerable pains\r\nto say nothing that might be offensive to the church, and he closes his\r\n_Commentary on the Sphere_ with the statement that if in it or other\r\nwritings of his aught is found to criticize, he will gladly submit\r\nit to the correction of the very holy Roman church. Possibly this\r\nremark and others like it represent a revision of his works undertaken\r\nafter his first condemnation at Bologna. According to one of the late\r\nmanuscripts,[2992] Cecco, when summoned before the Inquisition at\r\nFlorence, claimed that his book had been corrected by the inquisitor of\r\nLombardy. This defense was not allowed, however, and the terms of the\r\nsentence at Bologna would seem to preclude it. And since the sentence\r\ngiven at Florence absolutely forbade anyone to possess the book, there\r\ndoes not seem much reason why a revised rather than the original\r\nversion should survive.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Cecco’s astrology not the most extreme.]\r\n\r\nOn the whole, then, it would be surprising if Cecco’s condemnation\r\nwere due merely or primarily to his astrological teachings. As\r\nTiraboschi[2993] noted nearly one hundred and fifty years ago, he\r\nupholds human free will, though attributing to the stars a natural\r\ninclination to vice or virtue, and holding other superstitions common\r\nto the astrologers of his time. Tiraboschi also noted his submissive\r\ntone to the church and was unable to see in the _Commentary on the\r\nSphere_ the errors which had been charged to Cecco’s account. More\r\nthan this, in a number of respects Cecco did not go as far as some of\r\nhis predecessors or subsequent writers. Christ and Antichrist had been\r\npartially subjected to the stars by writers before him who do not seem\r\nto have been assailed by the Inquisition for their views, and Pierre\r\nd’Ailly, the great cardinal and reformer, went much farther in this\r\ndirection than Cecco in the next century. Peter of Abano had held views\r\nconcerning the influence of the constellations on the appearance of\r\nnew religions and on prayers to God which Cecco rejects. But all in\r\nvain the concessions made to the Christian standpoint by Cecco at the\r\nexpense of astrological doctrine; of him alone we know surely that he\r\nwas condemned by the Inquisition, and he went to the stake.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Charge that he taught astrological necromancy.]\r\n\r\nWe have not yet, however, discussed Villani’s charge that in his\r\n_Commentary on the Sphere_ Cecco asserted that there were evil spirits\r\ngenerated in the sky who could be coerced by incantations under certain\r\nconstellations to perform many marvels. Villani perhaps has reference\r\nto the passage in which Cecco gives astronomical directions to be\r\nfollowed by anyone who wishes to make an image by means of which he\r\nmay receive responses from spirits.[2994] There is indeed a good deal\r\nof information concerning spirits in the heavens in Cecco’s commentary\r\non Sacrobosco’s manual, and he shows a wide acquaintance with books of\r\nmagic. We turn, therefore, from his astrology proper to his attitude to\r\nmagic and to astrological necromancy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: His attitude toward magic.]\r\n\r\nCecco’s attitude to magic so-called is the usual one of condemnation.\r\nHe repeats that Zoroaster was “the first inventor of the magic art,”\r\nand gives a classification of the magic arts almost identical with that\r\nof Hugh of Saint Victor, but states that he derives it from the _Liber\r\nde vinculo spiritus_ of Hipparchus, a book of necromancy. Cecco says\r\nthat magic is “emphatically censured by holy mother church,”[2995] and\r\nhe does not directly question or qualify this condemnation. He says\r\nnothing of a natural magic which is harmless. His chief concern with\r\nmagic, as in the cases of Michael Scot and Peter of Abano, seems to be\r\nto distinguish astrology from it as a reputable science, and to hold\r\nthat one can learn of the future better as well as more legitimately by\r\nastrology.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: His frequent citation of books of magic and necromancy.]\r\n\r\nThe fact, however, that the church disapproves of magic and\r\n“vituperates” it, does not restrain Cecco from frequent citation of\r\nbooks of magic, such as the _Liber artis magicae_ of Apollonius,[2996]\r\nnor from retailing to his students much information concerning\r\nspirits in the sky and necromancy. Thus when Sacrobosco mentions the\r\nfour points of the compass, Cecco is reminded of a statement in the\r\n_Liber de ordine intelligentiarum_ of Hipparchus that certain princes\r\nof the demons “occupy the four parts beneath the sky. For expelled\r\nfrom heaven, they occupy the air and the four elements.”[2997] When\r\nSacrobosco speaks of the zenith and poles in a purely astronomical\r\nway, Cecco again quotes Hipparchus as saying, “O wonderful zenith and\r\ngodlike nature,”[2998] etc., after the manner of an invocation, and\r\nSolomon in the _Liber de umbris idearum_ as exclaiming, “O arctic\r\nManes! O antarctics propelled by divinity! Why do natures so great\r\nand noble seem to be enclosed in mineral species?” This last remark,\r\nCecco explains, refers to the responses given by these spirits in\r\nmetal mirrors.[2999] When Sacrobosco treats of climates, Cecco\r\nremarks that the word may be understood necromantically as well as\r\nastronomically. Zoroaster, the inventor of the magic art, uses the\r\nword in the necromantic sense when he says, “For those climates are\r\nto be marveled at, which with flesh of corpses and human blood give\r\nresponses trustworthily.” “By this,” continues Cecco, “you should\r\nunderstand those four spirits of great virtue who stand _in cruciatis\r\nlocis_, that is, in east, west, north, and south, whose names are\r\nOriens, Amaymon, Paymon, and Egim,[3000] spirits who are of the major\r\nhierarchy and who have under them twenty-five legions of spirits each.\r\nTherefore because of their noble nature these seek sacrifice from human\r\nblood and likewise from the flesh of a dead man or cat.[3001] But this\r\nZoroastrian art cannot be carried on without great peril, fastings,\r\nprayers, and all things which are contrary to our Faith.”[3002]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Necromancy employs evil spirits.]\r\n\r\nThis last word of warning may seem a bit belated and perhaps somewhat\r\nperfunctory, but shows Cecco still consistent in recognizing that\r\nmagic and necromancy are contrary to the Christian religion. In other\r\npassages he calls these spirits demons and diabolical,[3003] and\r\naffirms with Augustine that “spirits who are outside the order of\r\ngrace” cannot truly transmute bodies, nor raise the dead, nor do any\r\nmarvels and feats of magic except those which can be accounted for by\r\nthe occult virtues of nature.[3004] And in speaking of a demon named\r\nFloron, who was mentioned by Solomon in the _Book of the Shadows of\r\nIdeas_, who was of the hierarchy of cherubim, who was confined in a\r\nsteel mirror by a major invocation, who knew many secrets of nature,\r\nand who deceived King Manfred and others by ambiguous oracles in\r\nmodern times,--Cecco concludes, “So beware of these demons because\r\ntheir ultimate intention is to deceive Christians to the discredit of\r\nour Lord Jesus Christ.” Cecco tells a story of a man of Ferrara who\r\nconsulted this demon Floron as to hidden treasure and was told that he\r\nwould find enough in a certain spot to last him for the rest of his\r\nlife. He dug in the cavern indicated and uncovered only four ounces\r\nof gold, but as an avalanche crushed him immediately afterward, the\r\noracle was fulfilled.[3005] Yet on the next page we find Cecco giving\r\nthe instructions already mentioned for making an astronomical image\r\nin order to obtain responses from a spirit. And several pages further\r\non he cites a response of this same Floron as to the time when demons\r\nare least liable to deceive one and when as a consequence it is best\r\nto consult them, and again as to the divinity of Christ, of whom this\r\ndemon Floron said, “He took upon Him human flesh that all flesh through\r\nHim might be saved.”[3006]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Cecco unduly curious rather than heretical in this regard.]\r\n\r\nThus, much of Cecco’s work seems less a commentary upon Sacrobosco’s\r\ntext than a manual of astrological necromancy. His citations from\r\nthe books of magic and necromancy well illustrate those relations\r\nbetween astronomy, magic, and necromancy to which we have before\r\nhad allusions in the writings of Albertus Magnus and elsewhere. We\r\nremember the distinction drawn in the _Speculum astronomiae_ between\r\ncommendable works of astronomy and injurious works of necromancy,\r\nand we wonder if the cause of Cecco’s condemnation may not have been\r\nthat instead of sticking to the field of astrology he made these\r\ndangerous excursions into the subject of necromancy. It might well be\r\nheld that he was leading his students into temptation by the numerous\r\nreferences to demons, the magic art, and astrological necromancy in\r\nhis _Commentary on the Sphere_. At the same time it must be remembered\r\nthat such pillars of the Christian Faith and learning as William of\r\nAuvergne and Albertus Magnus had read and cited books of magic and\r\nnecromancy. Cecco’s passages concerning astrological necromancy are\r\nalmost all quotations or citations from other authors. When he speaks\r\nin his own name it is usually to declare magic and necromancy contrary\r\nto Christianity and to censure the passages which he has just cited.\r\nMoreover, the notion of hierarchies of spirits, of their presence in\r\nsky and air and elements, of their power to work marvels,--all these\r\nwere orthodox enough Christian doctrines. And Cecco does not, like\r\nWilliam and Albert, hint at a natural variety of magic apart from\r\ndemons which is not idolatrous and unchristian. Of indiscreet curiosity\r\nconcerning such matters and undue mention of them he might be found\r\nguilty, but scarcely of any direct heresy so far as his extant written\r\nworks are concerned.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Was Cecco’s death due to personal enemies?]\r\n\r\nIf neither Cecco’s astrology nor his citation of books of magic\r\nand necromancy seems sufficiently extreme to account alone for his\r\ncondemnation by the Inquisition, we may perhaps find the clue in the\r\nhypothesis of personal enemies, which has already been more than\r\nonce advanced by writers on Cecco. That he would have made bitter\r\npersonal enemies one can well imagine from the sharp personalities\r\nin which he indulges in his works. That such personalities were not\r\nunwelcome to the taste of that time, however, is indicated by Dante’s\r\nfrequent allusions to the recent dead in his _Inferno_. Cecco with\r\nless discretion directed his gibes against the living. Thus he states\r\nthat the head and tail of the dragon are the intersections of circles,\r\nand not stars forming the shape of a dragon in the sky “as a certain\r\nphysician of ours of Ascoli (?) argued together with his mother who\r\nwas as big a fool as himself.”[3007] We have already mentioned Cecco’s\r\ninsulting words concerning the physician Gualfridinus, who seems\r\nthe same as Dino del Garbo. Now while Villani tells us that Cecco\r\nattributed his arrest at Florence to the chancellor of the duke, in\r\nthe very next chapter, in mentioning the death of Master Dino del\r\nGarbo, whom he calls a very celebrated physician and a man learned in\r\nnatural science and philosophy, who wrote “several noble books” at the\r\nrequest of King Robert of Naples, Villani adds that Dino “was a great\r\ncause of Cecco’s death, attacking as erroneous the book from which\r\nhe had lectured at Bologna; and many said that he did this through\r\nenvy.”[3008] Padre Appiani, a Jesuit who wrote an apology for Cecco in\r\nthe seventeenth century, attributed his persecution at Bologna to the\r\nson, Tommaso del Garbo, and that at Florence to Dino.[3009] Tiraboschi\r\nin the eighteenth century came to the conclusion that “envy had no\r\nsmall part in the condemnation of this unhappy astrologer, and that\r\nhe would not have perished so wretchedly if he had not had powerful\r\nenemies who conspired to his ruin.”[3010] Nothing is said by Villani\r\nof Cecco’s having offended the duke of Florence, Charles of Calabria,\r\nand so forfeited his favor and protection, but this would seem likely,\r\nthough of course it would account only for his second sentence at\r\nFlorence.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: His execution of little significance.]\r\n\r\nThe condemnation of Cecco, therefore, may be a good example of the\r\nway in which the Inquisition could be manipulated for private ends,\r\nbut it does not seem a sign of any general attack by the church and\r\nInquisition on astrology or on learned men who showed an interest\r\nin occult science. The charges repeated, or invented, against Cecco\r\nby Villani and the late manuscripts are loose and exaggerated. Why\r\nCecco d’Ascoli was burned at the stake is a problem that has puzzled\r\nmore than one investigator, and none of the explanations offered is\r\nentirely satisfactory. It is, however, fairly evident that the process\r\nagainst Cecco was a failure as an attempt to check his teachings and\r\nsimply advertised him and his writings. It came late in the medieval\r\nperiod and apparently was not soon repeated. Everything tends to\r\nindicate that his execution was an exceptional and sensational, but not\r\nespecially significant event. The attitudes toward astrology of Thomas\r\nAquinas, whom the church canonized, and of Albertus Magnus, who was\r\nbeatified, are much more important and more characteristic of medieval\r\necclesiastical culture.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[2950] G.

On the other hand, the works which we have studied\r\nwere reproduced again and again in manuscript form in the fourteenth\r\nand fifteenth centuries and then in printed form in the fifteenth\r\nand sixteenth centuries, as has been pointed out in many instances.\r\nSome topics, like that of experimental books, we have traced on as\r\nlate as into the seventeenth century. In short, the conceptions whose\r\nprevalence we have depicted in some detail for thirteen centuries of\r\nthought continued to have weight for a long time thereafter. On the\r\noccult and magical side, moreover, later writers like Henry Cornelius\r\nAgrippa, Trithemius, or Cardan were to add little or nothing to\r\nwhat had been often repeated before. In the field of experimental\r\nscience, on the other hand, a period of greater progress came later.\r\nGradually, too,--very gradually it would seem until almost our own\r\ntime--scepticism was to come to prevail among scientists as to the\r\npossibility of magic in any of its forms in the world of nature. A\r\ngreat task still awaits him who shall trace the slow rise of effective\r\nscepticism through such writings against astrology as those of\r\nNicholas Oresme in the fourteenth, and Pico della Mirandola, who at\r\nthe same time believed in magic, in the fifteenth century, and in such\r\ncriticisms of pseudo-science in general as Sir Thomas Browne’s _History\r\nof Vulgar Errors_ in the seventeenth century;[3011] and likewise the\r\ngradual dislodgment of the conception of occult virtue and influence by\r\nthat of natural law through the disclosure of many of nature’s former\r\nsecrets by scientific instruments and research.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Science not stagnant during it.]\r\n\r\nHowever, the disclosure of such secrets had already begun when the\r\nperiod of our investigation opened and it continued during our period\r\nof thirteen centuries, which was no such age of retrogression or\r\nstagnation as it has formerly been depicted. The ideas and discoveries\r\nof Hellenic, not to say oriental, science persisted and were preserved\r\nby medieval men to a greater extent than has been generally recognized;\r\nand to them the medieval men added questions, observations, and even\r\ndiscoveries of their own. Not only did curiosity concerning nature’s\r\nsecrets continue, but the authority of the ancients was often received\r\nwith scepticism; and a marked tendency runs through our period to\r\nrely upon rationalism and experimental method. I have exposed the\r\n_Physiologus_ myth, the _Florilegia_ myth, the legend of Roger Bacon as\r\na lone herald of modern experimental science, the notion that Vincent\r\nof Beauvais adequately sums up all medieval science, and a number of\r\nother modern “vulgar errors” concerning medieval learning. I have shown\r\nthat medieval men were wider readers than has often been thought, that\r\nthe scholastics presented their material in a more systematic way than\r\nclassical writers, that the Latin of the thirteenth century has a\r\nclearer style and shows more direct thinking than the vernaculars of\r\nthe fifteenth century. Should we, moreover, go on to examine in detail\r\nthe writings of the early modern centuries, I suspect that we would\r\nfind them repeating the medieval authors just as these had repeated\r\nthe classical authorities. Gesner, for instance, in his _History of\r\nAnimals_, 1551-1587, copied Albertus Magnus as well as Aristotle. And\r\nof the scientific notions with which the men of the sixteenth century\r\nhave been credited by their admirers many might be found on closer\r\nscrutiny and comparison to date back to classical or medieval authors.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Nor a mere handmaid of religion.]\r\n\r\nNor can I agree that natural science in the middle ages, as has been\r\nsaid of medieval philosophy, was a mere handmaid of religion. Friar\r\nBacon pointed out, it is true, how experimental science might serve\r\nthe Church, but he also wished the Church to advance the study of\r\nscience. And in many ways the Church did so, while its opposition\r\nto scientific research at that time has been grossly exaggerated.\r\nIt is true that the Biblical and Christian conception of a created\r\nuniverse was generally accepted, but the Aristotelian and astrological\r\nconception of the heavenly bodies as eternal and incorruptible was\r\nscarcely less influential, and many writers held both conceptions,\r\nhowever inconsistent this may seem to us. We have met with some extreme\r\ninstances of the religious point of view affecting the attitude\r\ntoward nature, notably the idea that human sin affects or even upsets\r\nthe course of nature; but we have also seen that the moralizing and\r\nallegorizing supposed to characterize medieval nature-study have been\r\ngreatly over-estimated. For ancient pagans like Pliny and Seneca the\r\nstudy of nature seems to have taken the place of religion in large\r\nmeasure, but the introduction of Christianity did not result in the\r\ndiscontinuance or estoppal of the study of nature, nor in its reduction\r\nto a state of servitude. Medieval science was somewhat under the wing\r\nof the Church, as were so many other activities now purely secular, but\r\nscience even in the middle ages was learning to use its own wings. Both\r\nin Mohammedan and Christian society profane learning in general and\r\nscience in particular made progress, and the remains of Arabic science\r\nwould be much scantier than they are, were it not for the fact that\r\nmany works are preserved solely in Latin translations.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The belief in occult virtue.]\r\n\r\nBut many secrets of nature still remained undiscovered in our period,\r\nand hence it is not surprising that the conception of occult virtue\r\nin nature, of occult influence exerted by animals, herbs, and gems,\r\nor by stars and spirits, still prevailed to such an extent among\r\nmen of the highest scientific attainments then possible. How potent\r\nthis conception was, has been shown by the continued use of amulets,\r\nof ligatures and suspensions, by the general belief in fascination,\r\nphysiognomy, number mysticism, and divination from dreams. Some still\r\ncountenanced the occult force of words, figures, characters, and\r\nimages, or of this and that rite, ceremonial, and form. Especially\r\nsurprising is the prevalence of lot-casting under the pseudo-scientific\r\nform of geomancy. But others had begun to doubt the efficacy of\r\nsome or most of these things. Animism had pretty much had its day;\r\nnecromancy and the notory art received relatively little attention,\r\nalthough the Church appears to have rather encouraged them by insisting\r\nupon the existence and power of evil spirits. But even the fathers\r\nand theologians made the point that demons work their marvels largely\r\nthrough their superior knowledge of natural forces. Much more in\r\nscience and medicine have we seen the notion of spiritual force\r\ndisplaced by that of occult natural virtue, and use made of natural\r\nsubstances rather than of incantations. Some of our authors would\r\nexplain the results achieved by incantations entirely by the force\r\nof suggestion. Of the later witchcraft delusion which overpowered\r\nthe learned as well as the populace we have found relatively few\r\nharbingers. The discussion of sorcery and witchcraft has been less in\r\nour medieval than in our ancient authors, and less among our scientists\r\nthan among our theologians. The subject has been broached chiefly in\r\nconnection with formal definitions of magic arts or the practical\r\nproblem of impotency after marriage.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Dominance of astrology.]\r\n\r\nWe have also repeatedly seen magic itself becoming more scientific or\r\npseudo-scientific in method and appearance. This is well illustrated by\r\nthe fact that in our authors of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries\r\nastrology is the most widespread, as it is the most pseudo-scientific\r\nof any variety of the magic arts. Indeed, it has ceased to be merely\r\none method of divination and claims to study and disclose the universal\r\nlaw of nature in the rule of the stars, by which every fact in nature\r\nand every occult influence in magic may be explained. If this doctrine\r\nwere true, all other sciences and magic arts would be reduced to\r\nbranches of the supreme science and art of astronomy or astrology. But\r\nit is not true, and hence I prefer to classify astrology as a magic art\r\nalong with other arts of divination. And this brings us back to the\r\nquestion of the definition of magic.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Definition of magic.]\r\n\r\nThe results of this investigation seem to me to have justified the\r\nselection of the word, “magic,” as a generic term to include all\r\nsuperstitious arts and occult sciences, and to designate a great\r\nprimary division or phase of human thought and activity. Magic is\r\nsubordinate to no other superstition or occult art; they are more often\r\nregarded as subdivisions of it. The attempts of some of our authors to\r\ndistinguish between magic and astrology, or magic and divination, or\r\ngood and bad magic, or natural magic and sorcery, or witchcraft and\r\ncounter-magic, have all been exceedingly illogical and unconvincing.\r\nMagic appears, in our period at least, as a way of looking at the world\r\nwhich is reflected in a human art or group of arts employing varied\r\nmaterials in varied rites, often fantastic, to work a great variety of\r\nmarvelous results, which offer man a release from his physical, social,\r\nand intellectual limitations, not by the imaginative and sentimental\r\nmethods of music, melodrama, fiction, and romance, or by religious\r\nexperience or asceticism, but by operations supposed to be efficacious\r\nhere in the world of external reality. Some writers, chiefly\r\ntheologians, lay great stress on resort to spirits in magic, some\r\nupon the influence of the heavens, some on both these forces, which\r\nyet others almost identify; but, except as theological dogma insists\r\nupon the demoniacal character of magic, or as astrological doctrine\r\ninsists on the rule of the stars, it cannot be said that spirits or\r\nstars are thought of as always necessary in magic. The _sine qua non_\r\nseems to be a human operator, materials, rites, and an aim that borders\r\non the impossible, either in itself, such as predicting the future or\r\ncuring incurable diseases or becoming invisible, or in relation to the\r\napparently inadequate means employed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Difficulty of reducing magic to one principle.]\r\n\r\nIn our authors it has been difficult to account for the particular\r\noccult properties attributed to things and acts, or to detect any\r\none underlying principle, such as sympathy, symbolism, imitation,\r\ncontagion, resemblance, or association, guiding the selection of\r\nmaterials and rites for magic. This is either because there never was\r\nsuch a principle, and magic from the start was empirical and complex,\r\nor because we deal with a late stage in its development, when the\r\nsuperstitions of different peoples have coalesced, when the peculiar\r\ncustoms of folk-lore have become confused with those of science and\r\nreligion, after the primitive methods of magic have been artificially\r\nover-elaborated, and after many usages have become gradually corrupted\r\nand their original meaning has been forgotten. Whether magic is good or\r\nevil, true or false, is with our authors a matter of opinion, in which\r\nthe majority hold it to be true but evil. Every shade of opinion is\r\nrepresented, however; but furthermore few can avoid a wholesome feeling\r\nthat there is something false about magic somewhere. This sounds the\r\nsignal, as it were, for magic’s doom.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Human fondness for the fallacious.]\r\n\r\nHowever, I suspect that it is not so much that magic has been shown\r\nto be false, as it is that men have come to set a greater value upon\r\ntruth, that accounts for magic’s decline. As I survey the practice\r\nand “beliefs” of primitive and savage tribes or the columns of modern\r\nnewspapers and much of modern literature, I become convinced that men\r\nhave a natural tendency to assert, and craving to hear the sensational,\r\nexaggerated, and impossible, and to fly in the face both of reason and\r\nexperience. People take pleasure in affirming the extravagant and in\r\nbelieving the incredible, in saying that they have seen or done what no\r\none else has seen or done. Cows, for instance, seldom or never burst,\r\nas everyone knows perfectly well, primitive man probably better than\r\ncivilized; that is what makes it interesting to mention circumstances\r\nunder which they will burst. “Lord, I believe, help Thou my unbelief,”\r\nis a good picture of the mental attitude supporting much of magic,\r\nwhich may be not so much a matter of belief as of make-believe.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Utility is not magic’s strongest appeal.]\r\n\r\nTo turn from “belief” to practice, I suspect that much magic is\r\ndone from want of anything better or else to do, rather than from\r\ncomplete conviction of its efficacy. When Pamphile in the pages of\r\nApuleius anointed herself from top to toe in order to turn into an\r\nowl, it was because this was the best way of which she could think\r\nto enable herself to fly far, far away. But had an airplane been at\r\nhand, I fancy she would have had more confidence in it for purposes\r\nof flight. Inventions in artificial lighting have probably done more\r\nthan sermons, arguments, and laws to dispel the works of darkness with\r\nwhich magicians whiled away the night-time. Had electric light been\r\ninvented in Pamphile’s age, she would probably have spent her evenings\r\nin jazz or at a movie. It was probably not during the hunting season\r\nthat cave-men drew their magic pictures of wild boars and bulls. The\r\ntelepathy practiced by savages in war and hunting[3012] is perhaps less\r\nfrom firm faith in its potency than because the women left at home want\r\nto do something and to share somehow in the crucial operations, and\r\nfurthermore are expected “to do their bit” by the men in the field.\r\nPerhaps such telepathic magic had almost as great actual efficacy\r\ntoward its end as some of the desperate expedients, prompted more by\r\npatriotic emotion than discreet calculation, which were adopted to\r\nhelp “win the war” or to “maintain morale” by those who stayed at home\r\nduring the recent great conflict. I should doubt if most men ever\r\nbelieved that rain falls only as a result of magic. It seems more\r\nlikely that they are aware that the rain will come some time, and hence\r\nare ready to do almost anything which may hurry it up or relieve their\r\nown feelings and inaction in the meantime. As no modern scientist has\r\nbrought to their attention any more efficacious method of altering the\r\nweather, they continue their time-honored rite regardless of our jeers.\r\nIt does as well as any. But where some prehistoric genius introduced\r\nartificial irrigation, rainmaking magic probably promptly declined in\r\npopularity.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The spirit of magic is not the scientific spirit.]\r\n\r\nIn the case of rain-making there is evidently much truth in Sir James\r\nFrazer’s statement that “the fallacy of magic is not easy to detect,\r\nbecause nature herself generally produces sooner or later the effects\r\nwhich the magician fancies he produces by his art.”[3013] But the\r\ndictum cannot be stretched to cover magic in general. In some cases\r\nthe fallacy of magic is all too evident, but men love it, or there\r\nis as yet no truth discovered to take its place. Rational scepticism\r\nis needed to dispel the former; repeated experiment, to arrive at the\r\nlatter. Believers in and practitioners of magic probably at no time in\r\nits history either even flattered themselves on so sound a basis of\r\ntheory, or were so severely practical in their aims and methods, as not\r\nto delight in the marvelous and incredible and impossible for their own\r\nsake. Rather in providing or attempting to provide for practical wants\r\nand emergencies, considerations of credibility and possibility often\r\nwere apt to be cast to the winds. Thus the spirit of magic is different\r\nfrom the scientific spirit.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Magic and experimental science.]\r\n\r\nYet our material has conclusively shown that the history of magic\r\nis bound up with the history of science as well as with folk-lore,\r\nprimitive culture, and the history of religion. Sometimes our authors\r\nhave spoken of natural magic, but I rather wonder whether there could\r\nwell be any other kind, since man must always reckon with his natural\r\nenvironment. It is not without reason that the Magi stand out in\r\nPliny’s pages not as mere sorcerers or enchanters but as those who have\r\ngone farthest and in most detail--too curiously, in his opinion--into\r\nthe study of nature. It is not without reason that we have found\r\nexperimentation and magic so constantly associated throughout our\r\nperiod. After all it is not surprising that magic, which was both\r\ncurious and tried to accomplish things, should investigate nature and\r\nshould experiment. It is even possible that magicians were the first to\r\nexperiment, or shared that province with the first inventors and the\r\nuseful arts, and that natural science, originally philosophical and\r\nspeculative, took over experimental method in a crude form, as well\r\nas the conception of occult virtue, from magic. As Sir James Frazer\r\nhas said, “Here is a body of men relieved, at least in the higher\r\nstages of savagery, from the need of earning their livelihood by hard\r\nmanual toil, and allowed, nay, expected and encouraged, to prosecute\r\nresearches into the secret ways of nature.”[3014] It is therefore\r\nperhaps not surprising that men like Galen, Apuleius, Apollonius,\r\nand Dunstan were accused of magic by their contemporaries; that men\r\nlike Gerbert, Michael Scot, and Albertus Magnus were represented as\r\nmagicians in later, if not contemporary legend; that _Lithica_ and\r\nRoger Bacon tell us of the danger of sages being accused of magic; that\r\nthe _Book of Enoch_, Cyprian, Firmicus, and Picatrix confuse magic with\r\nother arts and sciences; and that no one of our authors, try as he may,\r\nsucceeds in keeping magic entirely out of science or science entirely\r\nout of magic.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Science is a gradual evolution, not a modern creation.]\r\n\r\nBe that as it may, if the anthropologists are correct in asserting\r\nthat magic forms a great part of the life and thought of early man and\r\nof all primitive peoples, it is evident that only gradually would the\r\nscience and thought of civilized peoples free themselves from the old\r\nhabits and instincts. Modern science cannot exempt itself from its own\r\ntheory of evolution as Julius Firmicus exempted the Roman emperor from\r\nthe rule of the stars. Science did not come down from above nor invade\r\nfrom without. It grew up in the very midst of superstition and mental\r\nanarchy, just as the states of modern Europe had their beginnings in\r\nfeudal society. As the kings in the middle ages had to govern under\r\nfeudal limitations and even by feudal means, so science for a long\r\ntime not merely was opposed by the unscientific attitude, but was\r\nitself tinged by fantastic theories and false data. It is scarcely a\r\nparadox to say that during our Roman and medieval period the laws of\r\nmagic were better defined and understood than those of science. Yet the\r\nscientific attitude, like the spirit of nationality, was at work in\r\nthe seeming chaos; gradually it shook itself free from error, and, by\r\nthe increasing application of truly scientific methods, won a similar\r\ntriumph to that which the sovereign political power gained by its\r\ngradual development of governmental institutions.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Its medieval stage of development.]\r\n\r\nThis was the process going on in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries.\r\nWhen men still believed in demons and witches and divination from\r\ndreams, it is not surprising that they believed also in natural magic.\r\nOnly a small part of nature’s secrets were revealed to them; of the\r\nrest they felt that almost anything might turn out to be true. It was\r\na time when “one vast realm of wonder spreads around.” They had to\r\nstruggle against a huge burden of error and superstition which Greece\r\nand Rome and the Arabs handed down to them; yet they must try to\r\nassimilate what was of value in Aristotle, Galen, Pliny, Ptolemy, and\r\nthe rest. Crude naïve beginners they were in many respects. Yet they\r\nshow an interest in nature and its problems; they are drawing the line\r\nbetween science and religion; they make some progress in mathematics,\r\ngeography, physics and chemistry; they not only talk about experimental\r\nmethod, they actually make some inventions and discoveries of use in\r\nthe future advance of science. Moreover, they themselves feel that\r\nthey are making progress. They do not hesitate to disagree with their\r\nancient authorities, when they know something better. Roger Bacon\r\naffirms that many scientific facts and truths are known in his time of\r\nwhich Plato and Aristotle, Hippocrates and Galen, were ignorant. The\r\nancients, says Peter of Spain in effect, were philosophers, but we are\r\nexperimenters. Magic still lingers but the march of modern science has\r\nbegun.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Does magic survive in modern learning?]\r\n\r\nAre there other sides of our life and thought to-day where magic still\r\nlingers and no such march as that of modern natural and experimental\r\nscience has been begun or progressed so far? We fear that there are.\r\nOne can well imagine that a future age may regard much of the learning\r\neven of our time as almost as futile, superstitious, fantastic in\r\nmethod, and irrelevant to the ends sought, as were primitive man’s\r\nmethods of producing rain, Egyptian amulets to cure disease, or\r\nmedieval blood-letting according to the phases of the moon. Ptolemy\r\nbelieved in astrology, but how many archaeologists and philologists and\r\nstudents of early religion and mythology and folk-lore there are who\r\nfail to observe his great law that one should always adopt the simplest\r\npossible hypothesis consistent with the observed facts! How some\r\nransack the latest and remotest sources for some one brief annotation\r\nby a scholiast that may support some ingenious theory concerning the\r\nearliest origins of a language, a cult, or a deity,--which theory too\r\noften has only this to recommend it, that no one has ever thought of\r\nit before! How to prove a point concerning some single country and\r\nrestricted period they bring together word-forms, coins, fragments of\r\nvases, customs, and folk-tales from the most outlandish regions and\r\nwidely separated eras, and pile up a huge collection of most erudite\r\nlooking footnotes, full of abbreviated formulae denoting German\r\nperiodicals which have all the appearance of the unintelligible jargon\r\nof some ancient incantation! As one reflects upon the respect and\r\nadmiration with which such “scholarship” and “research” is regarded\r\nby many in our own time, can one wonder that in the middle ages and\r\nantiquity the pharmacist who added to his compound herb after herb from\r\nIndia and other romantic lands, or part after part from the carcasses\r\nof fabulous animals, in a frantic effort to improve upon a remedy that\r\nwas wrong to start with,--can one wonder if he was hailed in his day\r\nas a discoverer and public benefactor, if his compound was copied in\r\nbook after book and century after century, and, while he perhaps had\r\ndevised it against some one ailment, if it came in time to be regarded\r\nas a panacea for all ills? How many historical generalizations, which\r\noriginated in superficial association of ideas on no sounder a basis\r\nthan that supposed by some to lie behind magic, are not only still\r\ncurrent, but are glibly and unquestioningly assumed as themselves\r\na basis for what might otherwise be considered truly scientific\r\ninvestigation of more detailed and less important points!\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Or in other sides of present life?]\r\n\r\nWe might carry our comparison from the world of scholarship, which at\r\nleast displays industry and ingenuity in its superstitions, to the\r\ncruder and lazier conceptions and assumptions of social and civil life.\r\nOften enough has the connection of religion with magic been pointed\r\nout, but what side of life is there that is free from it? If not\r\nsheer intolerance, what else than survivals or revivals of ritual are\r\nall those conventions of dress and etiquette which are supposed to\r\ndistinguish ladies and gentlemen from their fellow human beings? “Good\r\nform” is one of the last lines of trenches by which stupidity endeavors\r\nto hold its conquest or inheritance or--shall we say?--native soil of\r\nrespectability. And how much we are forced to hear of literary or of\r\nsocial charm! Is such charm any less fleeting and fallacious than the\r\nmagic charm from which it takes its name? Does it advance truth or\r\nretard civilization? Is not the man without it, who has to be twice as\r\nefficient in order to secure the same position as the man with it, the\r\ntrue builder? Does such personal charm add any more to its possessor’s\r\nreal value to society than the incantation of the ancient artisan did\r\nto his industrial process? We believe that it does, but so did he.\r\nOr who can marvel at past belief in the magic power of words, who\r\nhears statesmen speak and millions shout of Militarism, Unconditional\r\nSurrender, Nationality, Democracy, Prohibition, Socialism, and\r\nBolsheviki? What fears, what hopes, what passions, what prejudices,\r\nwhat sacrifices these words elicit! And how little agreement there is\r\nas to their meaning! If our illustrations are somewhat frivolous and\r\nsuperficial, let us measure the amount of magic in present civilization\r\nby Plotinus’ standard. He who yields to the charms of love and family\r\naffection or seeks political power or aught else than Truth and true\r\nbeauty, or even he who searches for beauty in inferior things; he who\r\nis deceived by appearances, he who follows irrational inclinations,\r\nis as truly bewitched as if he were the victim of magic and _goetia_\r\nso-called. The life of reason is alone free from magic. Measuring\r\nour age by such a standard, we shall be tempted to cry out, Magic of\r\nmagics, all is magic! What else is there to write about?\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Importance of the history of experimental science.]\r\n\r\nAt least one thing, and that is experimental science. “It always is\r\nmaking acquisitions and never grows less; it ever elevates and never\r\ndegenerates; it is always clear and never conceals itself.” Of its\r\nrelations to magic through some thirteen centuries of thought I have\r\ndeemed it worth while to attempt a somewhat detailed picture in the\r\nforegoing pages, presenting not only a survey of occult science but\r\nof the lives and writings of some pioneers, now too forgotten, in\r\nscience’s earlier and less successful days. Originally magic alone was\r\nthe object of my investigation, and experimental science an unexpected\r\nby-product which forced its importance during our period increasingly\r\nupon the attention. For this reason, while the magic of the learned\r\nhas perhaps been treated here about as fully as it deserves, a\r\ncomplete and thorough history of experimental science through these\r\nthirteen centuries has not been attempted, and much new material in\r\nall probability still awaits discovery in the period of which we have\r\ntreated. And while I have not yet had time to do much reading in\r\nworks of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, I suspect that while\r\nthe writers on occult subjects have little or nothing new to say,\r\nexperimentation probably continued its evolution and that there may\r\neven be disclosed in obscure writers of that time germs of some of the\r\ndiscoveries usually ascribed to later and greater names.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Prominence of magic in the history of science.]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I have found little to suggest that medieval men\r\nthemselves purposely concealed scientific discoveries which they\r\nhad made, although it is true that some of them believed that the\r\nancients had done this, and although some of them pretended to do so\r\nthemselves. Above all I have demonstrated that when ancient or medieval\r\nauthors are apparently superstitious, they are really so, and that\r\nit is far-fetched to attempt to explain such passages as cryptograms\r\nor allegories or flights of poetical imagination or interpolations\r\nor signs of spurious authorship. Our authors do not intentionally\r\nemploy occult science to hide truths of natural science or inventions\r\nin applied science. Rather it is characteristic of magic and occult\r\nscience to make a pretense of hidden truth and of marvel-working which\r\nthey cannot substantiate. And the fact concerning our authors has been\r\nthat they cannot yet consistently discriminate between occult science\r\nand natural science, between magic and applied science.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: How the human mind works.]\r\n\r\nIf this investigation has shed some light on the biographies and\r\nbibliography of past scholars and scientists, on the textual history\r\nand criticism of particular works or the general condition of the\r\nmanuscript material, perhaps it has also supplied data that may prove\r\nof value to philosophers and psychologists in determining the laws of\r\nhuman thought and our intellectual processes. Instead, say, of giving\r\na so-called intelligence test to some hundreds of immature school\r\nchildren to discover which ones are well-nigh imbecile or idiotic,\r\nI have set forth for comparison the mature, carefully considered\r\nthoughts on certain topics of a number of the world’s intellectual\r\nleaders through centuries. We have seen the same old ideas continually\r\nrecurring,[3015] new ideas appearing with exceeding slowness, men of\r\nthe same given period holding a common stock of notions and being for\r\nthe most part in remarkable agreement. Even the most intellectual\r\nmen seem to have a limited number of ideas, just as humanity has a\r\nlimited number of domesticated animals. Not only is man unable by\r\ntaking thought to add one cubit to his stature, he usually equally\r\nfails to add one new idea to humanity’s small collection. Often men\r\nseem to be repeating the ideas like parrots. And this is not merely\r\npatristic, or scholastic; it is everlastingly human. Yet it has been\r\nevident that some of our authors were more original, resourceful,\r\ningenious, inquisitive than others. There is curiosity, occasionally\r\na new question is asked, an old thought put in a novel way, or a new\r\nexperiment tried.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Indestructibility of thought.]\r\n\r\nAs I have pursued this investigation, my wonder has grown at the number\r\nof learned men of whom memory has been preserved from a distant past\r\neven to our day, at the voluminousness of their extant writings, at\r\nthe many small details of their daily life which are known to us.\r\nSometimes their respective lives and thoughts intertwine and cross and\r\ncoincide so that a learned world and society seems to stand out entire.\r\nMoreover, what might be found out concerning them by exhausting the\r\nmanuscript material would doubtless be much greater than scholars have\r\nas yet established. At any rate the records are abundant, more so than\r\nfor any other phase of human life except perhaps art; they permit of\r\ndetailed examination; no severed fragments or dead bones, they throb\r\nwith life. Some species may lay more eggs, or multiply more rapidly,\r\nbut manuscripts survive. Neckam’s book has withstood the worms better\r\nthan its master, but he, too, still lives in and through it and his\r\nother books. If matter is indestructible and energy is conserved, may\r\nwe not paraphrase Adelard of Bath and say in closing: “And certainly in\r\nmy judgment nothing in this world of thought ever perishes utterly, or\r\nis less to-day than when it was created. If any concept is dissolved\r\nfrom one union, it does not perish but is joined to some other group.”\r\nMagic and experiment yesterday; science and experiment to-day. Long\r\nlive Thought! and may it some day regroup itself into Truth!\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[3011] On Nicolas Oresme, Bishop of Lisieux, see Francis Meunier,\r\n_Essai sur la vie et les ouvrages de Nicole Oresme_, Paris, 1857,\r\nwhere many treatises by him against astrology are listed, and Charles\r\nJourdain (1888), pp. 559-587, _Nicholas Oresme et les astrologues de la\r\ncour de Charles V_.\r\n\r\nIn Sloane 2156, 15th century, fols. 209v-224, I have read a\r\ntreatise by Oresme which Jourdain does not mention, namely, _Contra\r\nconjunctionistas de futurorum eventibus_, copied in 1430. In BN 10271,\r\nfols. 63-153, is a defense of astrology against Oresme’s criticisms by\r\nJohn Lauratius de Fundis, writing at Bologna in 1451.\r\n\r\nFor Pico’s twelve books against astrology, his twenty-six conclusions\r\nconcerning magic, and his _Apology_, in which he again defends natural\r\nmagic, see his works as published at Venice in 1519 or 1557. He accepts\r\nthe church’s condemnation of magic as usually practiced, but upholds\r\nnatural magic. A preliminary paragraph of praise in these printed\r\neditions credits Pico with having destroyed astrology root and branch,\r\nwhereas after previous attacks it had sprung up again, but this is\r\nexaggerated praise in view of the later favorable attitude toward\r\nastrology of such distinguished astronomers as Kepler and Tycho Brahe,\r\nor rather, it shows that the “astrology” attacked by Pico did not\r\ncomprise everything that we should classify under that head. Pico’s\r\nattack, such as it was, was countered by Lucius Bellantius in a defense\r\nof astrology published in 1502: _Defensio astrologiae contra Ioannem\r\nPicum Mirandulam Lucii Bellantii Senensis Mathematici ac Physici Liber\r\nde Astrologica Veritate et in Disputationes Ioannis Pici Adversus\r\nAstrologos Responsiones....
