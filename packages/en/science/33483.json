He was also author, in\r\nconjunction with Professor A. Scacchi, of an elaborate report upon the\r\nVolcanic Region of Monte Vulture, and on the Earthquake (commonly called\r\nof Melfi) of 1851. These, however, by no means exhaust the stock of\r\nPalmieri's labours.\r\n\r\nThe following Memoir of Signor Palmieri on the eruption of Vesuvius in\r\nApril of this year (1872), brief as it is, embraces two distinct\r\nsubjects, viz., his narrative as an eye-witness of the actual events of\r\nthe eruption as they occurred upon the cone and slopes of the mountain,\r\nand his observations as to pulses emanating from its interior, as\r\nindicated by his Seismograph, and as to the electric conditions of the\r\noverhanging cloud of smoke (so called) and ashes, as indicated by his\r\nbifilar electrometer, both established at the Observatory. The two last\r\nhave but an indirect bearing upon Vulcanology. The narrative of the\r\nevents of the eruption is characterised by exactness of observation and\r\na sobriety of language--so widely different from the exaggerated style\r\nof sensational writing that is found in almost all such accounts--that I\r\ndo the author no more than justice in thus expressing my view of its\r\nmerits.\r\n\r\nNor should a special narration, such as this, become less important or\r\nsuffer even in popular estimation by the fact that so recently my\r\nfriend, Professor J. Phillips, has given to the world the best general\r\naccount of Vesuvius, in its historical and some of its scientific\r\naspects, which has yet appeared. That monograph--with its sparkling\r\nstyle, and scholarly digressions, as well as for its more direct\r\nmerits--will, no doubt, become the manual for many a future visitor to\r\nthe volcanic region of Naples; but it, like the following Memoir of\r\nPalmieri, and in common with almost every work that has appeared on the\r\nsubject of Volcanoes, contains a good deal which, however interesting,\r\nand remotely related to Vulcanology, does not properly belong to the\r\nbody of that branch of cosmical science, as I understand its nature and\r\nlimits.\r\n\r\nIt tends but little, for example, to clear our views, or enlarge our\r\nknowledge of the vast mechanism in which the Volcano originates, and\r\nthat by which its visible mass is formed, that we should ascertain the\r\nelectric condition of the atmosphere above its eruptive cone, or into\r\nwhat crystallographic classes the mineral species found about it may be\r\ndivided: it will help us but little to know Pliny's notions of how\r\nPompeii was overwhelmed, or to re-engrave pictures, assumed to give the\r\nexact shape of the Vesuvian or other cone at different periods, or its\r\nprecise altitude, which are ever varying, above the sea. Even much more\r\ntime and labour may be spent upon analysing the vapours and gases of\r\nfumaroles and salfatares than the results can now justify.\r\n\r\nNothing, perhaps, tends more to the effective progress of any branch of\r\nobservational and inductive science, than that we should endeavour to\r\ndiscern clearly the scope and boundary of our subject.\r\n\r\nTo do so is but to accord with Bacon's maxim, \"_Prudens questio dimidium\r\nscientiæ_.\" That once shaped, the roads or methods of approach become\r\nclearer; and every foothold attained upon these direct paths enables us\r\nto look back upon such collateral or subordinate questions as at first\r\nperplexed us, and find them so illuminated that they are already\r\nprobably solved, and, by solution, again prove to us that we _are_ in\r\nthe right paths.\r\n\r\nI believe, therefore, that I shall not do disservice to the grand\r\nportion of cosmical physics to which volcanic phenomena belong, by\r\ndevoting the few pages accorded to me for this Introduction to sketching\r\nwhat seems to me to be the present position of terrestrial\r\n_Vulcanicity_, and tracing the outlines and relations of the two\r\nbranches of scientific investigation--_Vulcanology_ and _Seismology_--by\r\nwhich its true nature and part in the Cosmos are chiefly to be\r\nascertained.\r\n\r\nThe general term, _Vulcanicity_, properly comprehends all that we see or\r\nknow of actions taking place upon and modifying the surface of our\r\nglobe, which are referable not to forces of origin above the surface,\r\nand acting superficially, but to causes that have been or are in\r\noperation beneath it. It embraces all that Humboldt has somewhat vaguely\r\ncalled \"the reactions of the interior of a planet upon its exterior.\"\r\n\r\nThese reactions show themselves principally and mainly in the marking\r\nout and configuration of the great continents and ocean beds, in the\r\nforcing up of mountain chains, and in the varied phenomena consequent\r\nthereon, as seen in more or less adjacent formations.\r\n\r\nThese constitute the mechanism which has moulded and fashioned the\r\nsurface of our globe from the period when it first became superficially\r\nsolid, and prepared it as the theatre for the action of all those\r\nsuperficial actions--such as those of tides, waves, rain, rivers, solar\r\nheat, frost, vitality, vegetable and animal (passing by many others less\r\nobvious)--which perpetually modify, alter or renew the surface of our\r\nworld, and maintain the existing regimen of the great machine, and of\r\nits inhabitants. These last are the domain of Geology, properly so\r\ncalled. No geological system can be well founded, or can completely\r\nexplain the working of the world's system as we now see it, that does\r\nnot start from Vulcanicity as thus defined; and this is equally true,\r\nwhether, as do most geologists, we include within the term Geology\r\neverything we can know about our world as a whole, exclusive of what\r\nAstronomy teaches as to it, dividing Geology in general into Physical\r\nGeology--the boundaries of which are very indistinct--and\r\nStratigraphical Geology, whose limits are equally so.\r\n\r\nIt has been often said that Geology in this widest sense begins where\r\nAstronomy or Cosmogony ends its information as to our globe, but this is\r\nscarcely true.\r\n\r\nVulcanicity--or Geology, if we choose to make it comprehend that--must\r\ncommence its survey of our world as a nebula upon which, for unknown\r\nages, thermic, gravitant and chemical forces were operative, and to the\r\nfinal play of which, the form, density and volume, as well as order of\r\ndeposition of the different elements in the order of their chemical\r\ncombination and deposition was due, when first our globe became a liquid\r\nor partly liquid spheroid, and which have equally determined the\r\nchemical nature of the materials of the outward rind of the earth that\r\nnow is, and with these some of the primary conditions that have fixed\r\nthe characters, nature and interdependence of the vegetables and animals\r\nthat inhabit it. Physical Astronomy and Physical Geology, through\r\nVulcanicity, thus overlap each other; the first does not end where the\r\nsecond begins; and in every sure attempt to bring Geology to that\r\npinnacle which is the proper ideal of its completed design--namely, the\r\ninterpretation of our world's machine, as part of the universal Cosmos\r\n(so far as that can ever become known to our limited observation and\r\nintelligence)--we must carry with us astronomic considerations, we must\r\nkeep in view events anterior to the \"_status consistentior_\" of\r\nLeibnitz, nor lose sight of the fact that the chain of causation is one\r\nendless and unbroken; that forces first set moving, we know not when or\r\nhow, the dim remoteness of which imagination tries to sound in shadowy\r\nthought, like those of the grand old Eastern poem, \"When the morning\r\nstars first sang together,\" are, however changed in form, operative\r\nstill. The light and fragile butterfly, whose glorious garb irradiates\r\nthe summer zephyr in which it floats, has had its power of flight--which\r\nis its power to live--determined by results of that same chain of causes\r\nthat lifted from the depths the mountain on whose sunny side he floats,\r\nthat has determined the seasons and the colour of the flower whose\r\nnectar he sucks, and that discharges or dissipates the storm above, that\r\nmay crush the insect and the blossom in which it basked. And thus, as\r\nhas been said, it was not all a myth, that in older days affirmed that\r\nin some mysterious way the actions and the lives of men were linked to\r\nthe stars in their courses.\r\n\r\nWhatever may have been the manifestations of Vulcanicity at former and\r\nfar remoter epochs of our planet, and to which I shall return, in the\r\nexisting state of regimen of and upon our globe it shows itself chiefly\r\nin the phenomena of Volcanoes and of Earthquakes, which are the\r\nsubjects of Vulcanology and of Seismology respectively, and in principal\r\npart, also, of this Introduction.\r\n\r\nThe phenomena of hot springs, geysers, etc., which might be included\r\nunder the title of Thermopægology, have certain relations to both, but\r\nmore immediately to Vulcanology.\r\n\r\nLet us now glance at the history and progress of knowledge in these two\r\nchief domains of Vulcanicity, preparatory to a sketch of its existing\r\nstage as to both, and, by the way, attempt to extract a lesson as to the\r\nmethods by which such success as has attended our labours has been\r\nachieved.\r\n\r\nIt will be most convenient to treat of Seismology first in order.\r\n\r\nAristotle--who devotes a larger space of his Fourth Book, [Greek: Peri\r\nKosmou], to Earthquakes--Seneca, Pliny, Strabo, in the so-called classic\r\ndays, and thence no end of writers down to about the end of the\r\nseventeenth century--amongst whom Fromondi (1527) and Travagini (1679)\r\nare, perhaps, the most important now--have filled volumes with records\r\nof facts, or what they took to be such, of Earthquakes, as handed down\r\nto or observed by themselves, and with plenty of hypotheses as to their\r\nnature and origin, but sterile of much real knowledge.\r\n\r\nHooke's \"Discourses of Earthquakes,\" read before the Royal Society about\r\n1690, afford a curious example of how abuse of words once given by\r\nauthority clings as a hindrance to progress. He had formed no distinct\r\nidea of what he meant by an Earthquake, and so confusedly mixes up all\r\nelevations or depressions of a permanent character with \"subversions,\r\nconversions and transpositions of parts of the earth,\" however sudden or\r\ntransitory, under the name of Earthquakes.\r\n\r\nA like confusion is far from uncommon amongst geological writers, even\r\nat the present day, and examples might be quoted from very late writings\r\nof even some of the great leaders of English Geology.\r\n\r\nFrom the seventeenth to the middle of the eighteenth century one finds\r\nfloods of hypotheses from Flamsteed, Höttinger, Amontons, Stukeley,\r\nBeccaria, Percival, Priestly, and a crowd of others, in which\r\nelectricity, then attracting so much attention, is often called upon to\r\nsupply causation for a something of which no clear idea had been formed.\r\nCount Bylandt's singular work, published in 1835, though showing a\r\ncurious _partial_ insight in point of advancement, might be put back\r\ninto that preceding period.\r\n\r\nIn 1760 appeared the very remarkable Paper, in the fifty-first volume of\r\nthe \"Philosophical Transactions,\" of the Rev. John Mitchell, of\r\nCambridge, in which he views an Earthquake as a sudden lifting up, by a\r\nrapid evolution of steam or gas beneath, of a portion of the earth's\r\ncrust, and the lateral transfer of this gaseous bubble beneath the\r\nearth's crust, bent to follow its shape and motion, or that of a wave of\r\nliquid rock beneath, like a carpet shaken on air. Great as are certain\r\ncollateral merits of Mitchell's Paper, showing observation of various\r\nsorts much in advance of his time, this notion of an Earthquake is such\r\nas, had he applied to it even the imperfect knowledge of mechanics and\r\nphysics then possessed in a definite manner, he could scarcely have\r\nfailed to see its untenable nature. That the same notion, and in a far\r\nmore extravagant form, should have been reproduced in 1843 by Messrs.\r\nRogers, by whom the gigantic parallel anticlinals, flanks and valleys of\r\nthe whole Appalachian chain of mountains are taken for nothing more than\r\nthe indurated foldings and wrinkles of Mitchell's carpet, is one of the\r\nmost salient examples of the abuse of hypothesis untested by exact\r\nscience.\r\n\r\nNeither Humboldt nor Darwin, great as were the opportunities of\r\nobservation enjoyed by both, can be supposed to have formed any definite\r\nidea of _what_ an Earthquake is; and the latter, who had observed well\r\nthe effects of great sea-waves rolling in-shore after the shock, did not\r\nestablish any clear relation between the two.[A]\r\n\r\nHitherto no one appears to have formed any clear notion as to what an\r\nEarthquake is--that is to say, any clear idea of what is the nature of\r\nthe movement constituting the shock, no matter what may be the nature or\r\norigin of the movement itself. The first glimmering of such an idea, so\r\nfar as my reading has enabled me to ascertain, is due to the penetrating\r\ngenius of Dr. Thomas Young, who, in his \"Lectures on Natural\r\nPhilosophy,\" published in 1807, casually suggests the probability that\r\nearthquake motions are vibratory, and are analogous to those of\r\nsound.[B] This was rendered somewhat more definite by Gay Lussac, who,\r\nin an able paper \"On the Chemical Theories of Volcanoes,\" in the\r\ntwenty-second volume of the \"Annales de Chémie,\" in 1823, says: \"En un\r\nmot, les tremblements de terre ne sont que la propagation d'une\r\ncommotion à travers la masse de la terre, tellement indépendante des\r\ncavités souterraines qu'elle s'entendrait, d'autant plus loin que la\r\nterre serait plus homogène.\"\r\n\r\nThese suggestions of Young and of Gay Lussac, as may be seen, only refer\r\nto the movement in the more or less solid crust of the earth. But two,\r\nif not three, other great movements were long known to frequently\r\naccompany earthquake shocks--the recession of the sea from the shore\r\njust about the moment of shock--the terrible sounds or subterraneous\r\ngrowlings which sometimes preceded, sometimes accompanied, and sometimes\r\nfollowed the shock--and the great sea-wave which rolls in-shore more or\r\nless long after it, remained still unknown as to their nature. They had\r\nbeen recognised only as concomitant but unconnected phenomena--the more\r\ninexplicable, because sometimes present, sometimes absent, and wholly\r\nwithout any known mutual bearing or community of cause.\r\n\r\nOn the 9th February, 1846, I communicated to the Royal Irish Academy my\r\nPaper, \"On the Dynamics of Earthquakes,\" printed in Vol. XXI., Part I.,\r\nof the Transactions of that Academy, and published the same year in\r\nwhich it was my good fortune to have been able to colligate the observed\r\nfacts, and bringing them together under the light of the known laws of\r\nproduction and propagation of vibratory waves in elastic, solid, liquid\r\nand gaseous bodies, and of the production and propagation of liquid\r\nwaves of translation in water varying in depth, to prove that all the\r\nphenomena of earthquake shocks could be accounted for by a single\r\nimpulse given at a single centre. The definition given by me in that\r\nPaper is that an earthquake is \"_The transit of a wave or waves of\r\nelastic compression in any direction, from vertically upwards to\r\nhorizontally, in any azimuth, through the crust and surface of the\r\nearth, from any centre of impulse or from more than one, and which may\r\nbe attended with sound and tidal waves dependent upon the impulse and\r\nupon circumstances of position as to sea and land_.\"\r\n\r\nThus, for example, if the impulse (whatever may be its cause) be\r\ndelivered somewhere beneath the bed of the sea, all four classes of\r\nearthquake waves may reach an observer on shore in succession. The\r\nelastic wave of shock passing through the earth _generally_ reaches him\r\nfirst: its velocity of propagation depending upon the specific\r\nelasticity and the degree of continuity of the rocky or the incoherent\r\nformations or materials through which it passes.\r\n\r\nUnder conditions pointed out by me, this elastic wave may cause an\r\naqueous wave, producing recession of the sea, just as it reaches the\r\nmargin of sea and land.\r\n\r\nIf the impulse be attended by fractures of the earth's crust, or other\r\nsufficient causes for the impulse to be communicated to the air directly\r\nor through the intervening sea, ordinary sound-waves will reach the\r\nobserver through the air, propagated at the rate of 1,140 feet per\r\nsecond, or thereabouts; and may also reach him before or with or soon\r\nafter the shock itself, through the solid material of the earth; and\r\nlastly, if the impulse be sufficient to disturb the sea-bottom above the\r\ncentre of impulse, or otherwise to generate an aqueous wave of\r\ntranslation, that reaches the observer last, rolling in-shore as the\r\nterrible \"great sea-wave,\" which has ended so many of the great\r\nearthquakes, its dimensions and its rate of propagation depending upon\r\nthe magnitude of the originating impulse and upon the variable depth of\r\nthe water. It is not my purpose, nor would it be possible within my\r\nlimits here, to give any complete account of the matter contained in\r\nthat Paper, which, in the words of the President of the Academy upon a\r\nlater occasion, \"fixed upon an immutable basis the true theory of\r\nEarthquakes.\"[C] I should state, however, that in it I proved the\r\nfallacy of the notion of vorticose shocks, which had been held from the\r\ndays of Aristotle, and showed that the effects (such as the twisting on\r\ntheir bases of the Calabrian Obelisks) which had been supposed due to\r\nsuch, were but resolved motions, due to the transit rectilinearly of the\r\nshock.\r\n\r\nThis removed one apparent stumbling block to the true theory.\r\n\r\nIncidentally also it was shown that from the observed elements of the\r\nmovement of the elastic wave of shock at certain points--by suitable\r\ninstruments--the position and depth of the _focus_, or centre of\r\nimpulse, might be inferred.\r\n\r\nIn the same volume (\"Transactions of the Royal I. Academy,\" XXI.) I gave\r\naccount, with a design to scale, for the first self-registering and\r\nrecording seismometer ever, to my knowledge, proposed. In some respects\r\nin principle it resembles that of Professor Palmieri, of which he has\r\nmade such extended use at the Vesuvian Observatory, though it differs\r\nmuch from the latter in detail. In June, 1847, Mr. Hopkins, of\r\nCambridge, read his Report, \"On the Geological Theories of Elevation and\r\nEarthquakes,\" to the British Association--requested by that body the\r\nyear before--and printed in its Reports for that year.\r\n\r\nThe chief features of this document are a digest of Mr. Hopkins's\r\npreviously published \"Mathematical Papers\" on the formations of\r\nfissures, etc., by elevations and depressions, and those on the\r\nthickness of the earth's crust, based on precession, etc., which he\r\ndiscusses in some relations to volcanic action.\r\n\r\nThis extends to forty-one pages, the remaining eighteen pages of the\r\nReport being devoted to \"Vibratory Motions of the Earth's Crust produced\r\nby Subterranean Forces--Earthquakes.\"\r\n\r\nThe latter consists mainly of a _résumé_ of the acknowledged laws, as\r\ndelivered principally by Poisson, of formation and propagation of\r\nelastic waves and of liquid waves, by Webers, S. Russel and others--the\r\noriginal matter in this Report is small--and as respects the latter\r\nportion consists mainly in some problems for finding analytically the\r\nposition or depth of the centre of disturbance when certain elements of\r\nthe wave of shock are given, or have been supposed registered by\r\nseismometric instruments, such as that described by myself, and above\r\nreferred to.[D] At the time my original Paper \"On the Dynamics of\r\nEarthquakes\" was published, there was little or no _experimental_\r\nknowledge as to the actual velocity of transit of waves--analogous to\r\nthose of sound, but of greater amplitude--through elastic solids. The\r\nvelocity as deduced from theory, the solid being assumed quite\r\n_homogeneous_ and _continuous_, was very great, and might be taken for\r\nsome of the harder and denser rock formations at 11,000 or 12,000 feet\r\nper second. That these enormous velocities of wave transit would be\r\nsomething near those of actual earthquake shock seemed probable to me,\r\nand was so accepted by Hopkins.\r\n\r\nThus, he says (Report, p. 88): \"The velocity of the sea-wave, for any\r\nprobable depth of the sea, will be so small as compared with that of the\r\nvibratory wave, that we may consider the time of the arrival of the\r\nlatter at the place of observation as coincident with that of the\r\ndeparture of the sea-wave from the centre of divergence.\"\r\n\r\nIn my original Paper (Dynamic, &c.), I had suggested, as an important\r\nobject, to ascertain by actual experiment what might be the wave's\r\ntransit rate in various rocky and incoherent formations; and having\r\nproposed this in my first \"Report upon the Facts of Earthquake\" to the\r\nBritish Association, I was enabled by its liberality to commence those\r\nexperiments, in which I was ably assisted by my eldest son, then quite a\r\nlad--Dr. Jno. William Mallet, now Professor of Chemistry at the\r\nUniversity of Virginia, U.S.; and to give account of the results, in my\r\nsecond Report (\"Report, British Association for 1851\") to that body.\r\n\r\nThose experiments were made by producing an impulse at one end of an\r\naccurately measured base line, by the explosion of gunpowder in the\r\nformation experimented upon, and noting the time the elastic wave\r\ngenerated required to pass over that distance, upon a nearly level\r\nsurface. Special instruments were devised and employed, by which the\r\npowder was fired and the time registered, by touching a lever which\r\ncompleted certain galvanic contacts. The media or formations in which\r\nthese experiments were conducted were, damp sand--as likely to give the\r\nminimum rate--and crystalline rock (granite), as likely to give the\r\nmaximum. The results were received, not with doubt, but with much\r\nsurprise, for it at once appeared that the actual velocity of transit\r\nwas vastly below what theory had indicated as derivable from the density\r\nand modulus of elasticity of the material, taken as homogeneous, etc.\r\nThe actual velocities in feet per second found were:\r\n\r\n  In sand                          824·915 feet per second.\r\n  In discontinuous and\r\n    much shattered granite       1,306·425      \"     \"\r\n  In more solid granite          1,664·574      \"     \"\r\n\r\nThis I at once attributed, and as it has since been proved correctly, to\r\nthe loss of _vis viva_, and consequently of speed, by the _discontinuity\r\nof the materials_.\r\n\r\nAnd some indication of the general truth of the fact was derivable from\r\ncomparing the rude previous approximations to the transit rate of some\r\ngreat Earthquakes. In the case of that of Lisbon, estimated by Mitchell\r\nat 1,760 feet per second. It was still desirable to extend similar\r\nexperiments to the harder classes of stratified and of contorted rocks.\r\nThis I was enabled to carry into effect, at the great Quarries at\r\nHolyhead (whence the slate and quartz rocks have been obtained for the\r\nconstruction of the Asylum Harbour there), taking advantage of the\r\nimpulses generated at that period by the great mines of powder exploded\r\nin these rocks.\r\n\r\nThe results have been published in the \"Philosophical Transactions for\r\n1861 and 1862 (Appendix).\" They show that the mean lowest rate of wave\r\ntransit in those rocks, through measured ranges of from 5,038 to 6,582\r\nfeet, was 1,089 feet per second; and the mean highest, 1,352 feet per\r\nsecond; and the general mean 1,320 feet per second.\r\n\r\nBy a separate train of experiments on the compressibility of solid cubes\r\nof these rocks, I obtained the mean modulus of elasticity of the\r\nmaterial when perfectly continuous and unshattered, with this\r\nremarkable result--that in these rocks, as they exist at Holyhead,\r\n_nearly seven-eighths of the full velocity of wave transmission due to\r\nthe material, if solid and continuous, is lost by reason of the\r\nheterogeneity and discontinuity_ of the rocky masses as they are found\r\npiled together in Nature.\r\n\r\nI also proved that the wave-transit period of the unshattered material\r\nof these rocks was greatest in a direction _transverse_ to the bedding,\r\nand least in line parallel with that; but the effect of this in the\r\nrocky mass itself may be _more_ than counterbalanced by the\r\ndiscontinuity and imperfect contact of the adjacent beds.\r\n\r\nThese results indicate, therefore, that the superficial rate of\r\ntranslation of the solitary sea-wave of earthquakes may, when over very\r\ndeep water, equal or even exceed the transit rate (in some cases) of the\r\nelastic wave of shock itself.\r\n\r\nThese results have since received general confirmation by the careful\r\ndeterminations of the transit rates of actual earthquake waves, in the\r\nrocks of the Rhine Country and in Hungary, by Nöggerath and Schmidt\r\nrespectively, and by those made since by myself in those of Southern\r\nItaly, to which I shall again refer. In an elastic wave propagated from\r\na centre of impulse in an infinitely extended volume of a perfect gas,\r\nnormal vibrations are alone propagated--as is the case with sound in\r\nair.\r\n\r\nIn the case of like movements propagated in elastic and perfectly\r\nhomogeneous and isotropic solids, the wave possesses both normal and\r\ntransversal vibrations, and is, in so far, analogous to the case of\r\nlight. Mr. Hopkins, in his Report above referred to, has based certain\r\nspeculations upon the assumed necessary co-existence of both orders of\r\nvibration in actual earthquake shocks in the materials of which our\r\nearthy crust is actually composed.\r\n\r\nThe existence of transversal vibration in those materials has not been\r\nyet proved experimentally, though there is sufficient ground to preclude\r\nour denying their probable existence.\r\n\r\nThat if they do exist they play but a very subordinate part in the\r\nobservable phenomena of actual Earthquake is highly probable. This is\r\nthe view, supported not only by observations of the effects of such\r\nshocks in Nature, but by the theoretic consideration of the effects of\r\ndiscontinuity of formations in planes or beds more or less transverse to\r\nthe wave path (or line joining the centre of impulse with the mean\r\ncentre of wave disturbance at any point of its transit). If we suppose,\r\nfor illustration sake, such an elastic wave transmitted perpendicularly\r\nthrough a mass of glass plates, each indefinitely thin, and all in\r\nabsolute contact with each other, but without adhesion or friction, more\r\nor less of the transversal vibration of the wave would be cut off and\r\nlost at each transit from plate to plate, as the elastic compression\r\ncan, by the conditions, be transmitted only normally or by direct push\r\nperpendicularly from plate to plate. This must take place in Nature, and\r\nto a very great extent, and the consideration, with others, enabled me\r\ngenerally to apply the normal wave motion of shock alone to my\r\ninvestigation as to the depth of the centre of impulse of the great\r\nNeapolitan Earthquake of 1857, an account of which was published in\r\n1862, and to be presently further referred to.\r\n\r\nHitherto the multitudinous facts, or supposed facts, recorded in\r\nnumberless accounts of Earthquakes had remained almost wholly\r\nunclassified, and so far as they had been discussed--in a very partial\r\nmanner, as incidental portions of geological treatises--with little\r\nattempt to sift the fabulous from the real, or to connect the phenomena\r\nadmitted by reference to any general mechanical or physical causes. In\r\n1850 my first \"Report upon the Facts of Earthquakes,\" called for by the\r\nBritish Association in 1847, was read and published in the Reports of\r\nthat body for that year. In this, for the first time, the many recorded\r\nphenomena of Earthquakes are classified, and the important division of\r\nthe phenomena into primary and secondary effects of the shock was\r\nestablished. Several facts or phenomena, previously held as marvellous\r\nor inexplicable, were either, on sufficient grounds, rejected, or were,\r\nfor the first time, shown susceptible of explanation. Amongst the more\r\nnoticeable results were the pointing out that fissures and fractures of\r\nrock or of incoherent formations were but secondary effects, and, in the\r\nlatter, were, in fact, generally of the nature of inceptive landslips.\r\nThis last was not accepted, I believe, by geologists at the time; but\r\nthe correctness of the views then propounded as to earth fissures--the\r\nnature of the spouting from them of water or mud--the appearances taken\r\nfor smoke issuing from them, etc.--have since been fully confirmed,\r\nfirst, by my own observations upon the effects of the Great Neapolitan\r\nEarthquake of 1857, and more lately by those of Dr. Oldham upon the\r\nEarthquake of Cachar (India), where he was enabled to observe fissures\r\nof immense magnitude, the nature of the production of which he has well\r\ndescribed and explained in the \"Proceedings, Geological Society, London,\r\n1872.\"\r\n\r\nThe relations between meteorological phenomena proper and Earthquakes\r\nhave always been a subject of popular belief and superstition.\r\n\r\nThis was here carefully discussed, and with the result of disproving any\r\nconnection, or, if any, but of an indirect nature. I also, to some\r\nextent, towards the end of this Report, discussed the question of the\r\npossible nature of the _impulse itself_ which originates the shock; I\r\nshowed that it must be of the nature of a blow, and ventured to offer\r\n_conjecturally_ five possible causes of the impulse:\r\n\r\n     1. Sudden fractures of rock, resulting from the steady and slow\r\n     increase of elevatory pressure.\r\n\r\n     2. Sudden evolution (under special conditions) of steam.\r\n\r\n     3. Sudden condensation of steam, also under special conditions.\r\n\r\n     4. Sudden dislocations in the rocky crust of the earth, through\r\n     pressure acting in any direction.\r\n\r\n     5. Occasionally through the recoil due to explosive effects at\r\n     volcanic foci (p. 79-80).\r\n\r\nThe first and last of these I am, through subsequent light, disposed now\r\nto withdraw or greatly to modify.\r\n\r\nThe first, the supposed \"_snap and jar_, occasioned by the sudden and\r\nviolent rupture of solid rock masses,\" to which Mr. Scrope, in his very\r\nadmirable work on Volcanoes, is disposed to refer the impulse of\r\nearthquake shocks (Scrope, 2nd edit., p. 294), I believe may be proved\r\non acknowledged physical principles--when applied to the known\r\nelasticities and extensibilities of rocks, and keeping in view the small\r\nthicknesses fractured _at the same instant_--to be capable of only the\r\nmost insignificant impulsive effects; and if we also take into\r\nconsideration that strata, if so fractured, are necessarily not _free_,\r\nbut surrounded by others above and below, any such impulsive effect\r\nemanating from fracture may be held as non-existent or impossible. In\r\nthe statement of his views which follows, and in objecting to my second\r\nand third possible causes (p. 295-296, headed \"Objections to Mallet's\r\nTheory\"), Mr. Scrope appears to me to have fallen into the error of\r\nassuming that the nature of the _impulse_, or the cause producing it,\r\nforms any part of \"my theory of earthquake movement,\" or in anywise\r\naffects it. I carefully guarded against this in the original Paper\r\n(\"Transactions, Royal Irish Academy,\" Vol. XXI., p. 60, and again, p.\r\n97), when I stated \"it is quite immaterial to the truth of my theory of\r\nearthquake motion what view be adopted, or what mechanism be assigned,\r\nto account for the original impulse.\"\r\n\r\nAs regards the fifth conjecture suggested by me, I am now, with better\r\nknowledge and larger observation of volcanic phenomena, not prepared to\r\nadmit any single explosion at volcanic vents of a magnitude sufficient\r\nto produce by its recoil an earthquake wave of any importance, or\r\nextending to any great distance in the earth's crust. The rock of 200\r\ntons weight, said to have been projected nine miles from the crater of\r\nCotopaxi, which I quoted from Humboldt as an example,[E] I believe to be\r\nas purely mythical as the rock (_bloc rejetté_) of perhaps one-sixth of\r\nthat weight which, previous to the late eruption, lay in the middle of\r\nthe Atria dell Cavallo, and which it was roundly affirmed had been\r\n_blown_ out of the crater, but which in reality had at some time rolled\r\ndown from near the top of the cone, after having been dislodged from\r\nsome part of the upper lip of the crater walls, where, as its wonderful\r\nhardness and texture and its enamel-like surface showed, it had been\r\nroasted for years probably.\r\n\r\nNor do I believe in the _sudden_ blowing away of one-half the crater and\r\ncone of Vesuvius, or of any other volcano, at one effort, however\r\naffirmed.\r\n\r\nNothing more than conjecture as to the nature of the impulse producing\r\ngreat or small Earthquakes can, I believe, as yet be produced. That\r\nthere is some one master mechanism productive of most of the impulses of\r\ngreat shocks is highly probable, but that more causes than one may\r\nproduce these impulses, and that the causes operative in small and long\r\nrepeated shocks, like those of Visp-Comrie and East Haddam, differ much\r\nfrom those producing great Earthquakes, is almost certain.\r\n\r\nWe shall be better prepared to assign all of these when we have admitted\r\na true theory of volcanic action, and so are better able to see the\r\nintimate relations in mechanism between seismic and volcanic actions.\r\n\r\nIt is not difficult meanwhile to assign the very probable mechanism of\r\nthose comparatively petty repercussions which are experienced in close\r\nproximity to volcanic vents when in eruption, and which, though\r\ncertainly seismic in their nature, and powerful enough, as upon the\r\nflanks of Etna, to crack and fissure well-built church-towers, can\r\nscarcely be termed Earthquakes.\r\n\r\nIn my First Report I stated that almost nothing was known then of the\r\ndistribution of recorded Earthquakes in time or in space over our\r\nglobe's surface, and I proposed the formation and discussion of a\r\ncomplete catalogue of all recorded Earthquakes, with this in view.\r\n\r\nThis was approved by the Council of the British Association and at once\r\nundertaken by me, with the zealous and efficient co-operation of my\r\neldest son, Dr. J. W. Mallet. Nearly the whole of the Second British\r\nAssociation Report, of 1851, is occupied with the account of the\r\nexperiments as to the transit rate of artificially made shocks in sand\r\nand granite, as already referred to.\r\n\r\nThe Third Report, of 1852-1854, contains the whole of this, \"The\r\nEarthquake Catalogue of the British Association\" (of which, through the\r\nliberality of that body, more than one hundred copies were distributed\r\nfreely), in which are given, in columnar form, the following\r\nparticulars, from the earliest known dates to the end of 1842:\r\n\r\n     1. The date and time of day, as nearly as recorded.\r\n\r\n     2. The locality or place of occurrence.\r\n\r\n     3. The direction, duration, and number of shocks so far\r\n     recorded.\r\n\r\n     4. Phenomena connected with the sea--great sea-waves, tides,\r\n     etc.\r\n\r\n     5. Phenomena connected with the land--meteorological phenomena\r\n     preceding and succeeding. Secondary phenomena--all minor or\r\n     remarkable phenomena recorded.\r\n\r\n     6. The authority for the record.\r\n\r\nThough most materially assisted by the previous labours and partial\r\ncatalogues of Von Hoff, Cotte, Hoffman, Merrian, and, above all, of\r\nPerrey, the preparation of this catalogue--which demanded visits to the\r\nchief libraries of Europe, and the collating of some thousands of\r\nauthors in various languages and of all time--was a work of great and\r\nsustained labour, which, except for my dear son's help, I should never\r\nhave found time and power to complete. Professor Perrey, formerly of the\r\nFaculté des Sciences of Dijon, now _en retrait_, who has devoted a long\r\nand useful life to assiduous labours in connection with Seismology, was\r\nour great ally; and his catalogues are so large and complete for most\r\nknown parts of the world after 1842, that we were able to arrest our own\r\ncatalogue at that date, and take M. Perrey's as their continuation up to\r\n1850.\r\n\r\nThe whole British Association Catalogue thus embraces the long historic\r\nperiod of from 1606 B.C. of vulgar chronology, when the first known\r\nEarthquake is recorded, to A.D. 1850; and the base of induction which it\r\npresents as to the facts recorded extends to between 6,000 and 7,000\r\nseparate Earthquakes. My Fourth Report (\"Reports, British Association,\r\n1858,\") is occupied principally with the discussion of this great\r\ncatalogue, and with that of several special catalogues produced by other\r\nauthors with limited areas or objects.\r\n\r\nThe discussion of M. Perrey's local catalogues with those of others, in\r\nreference to a supposed prevalent apparent horizontal direction of shock\r\nin certain regions--as to distribution, as to season, months, time of\r\nday or night, relation to state of tide--the bearings of the views of\r\nZantedeschi and others as to the probable existence of a terrane\r\ntide--the supposed relations of the occurrence of Earthquakes upon the\r\nage of the moon, as deduced by Perrey, viz.: that 1st, Earthquakes occur\r\nmost frequently at the syzygies; 2nd, that their frequency increases at\r\nthe perigee and diminishes at the apogee; 3rd, that they are more\r\nfrequent when the moon is on the meridian than when she is 90° away from\r\nit--and the views of several authorities as to the distribution of\r\nEarthquakes in time and in space--occupy the first 46 pages of this\r\nReport.\r\n\r\nIt then proceeds to discuss the distribution in time and in space as\r\ndeduced from the full base of the great catalogue.\r\n\r\nThe results as to time are reduced to curves, and those as to space (or\r\ndistribution over our globe's surface) to the great seismic map\r\n(Mercator's projection), upon which and in accordance with certain\r\nprinciples and conventional laws, which admit of the indication of both\r\nintensity and frequency, all recorded Earthquakes have been so laid down\r\nas to present a real indication of the distribution of seismic energy\r\nfor the whole historic period and all over the world.\r\n\r\nThe original of this map, which also shows the Volcano (size, about 7\r\nfeet by 5 feet), remains for reference in the custody of the Royal\r\nSociety. A reduced copy was published with the Report, and to a still\r\nmore reduced scale has been reproduced in other places. It is impossible\r\nhere to do more than refer to a few of the more salient points.\r\n\r\nAs regards distribution in time, durational seismic energy may be\r\nconsidered as probably constant during historic time, though it is\r\nprobably a decaying energy viewed in reference to much longer periods.\r\nIt does not appear of the nature of a distinctly periodic force.\r\n\r\n     1. Whilst the minimum paroxysmal interval may be a year or two,\r\n     the average interval is from five to ten years of comparative\r\n     repose.\r\n\r\n     2. The shorter intervals are in connection with periods of\r\n     fewer Earthquakes, not always with those of least intensity,\r\n     but usually so.\r\n\r\n     3. The alternations of paroxysm and of repose appear to follow\r\n     no absolute law deducible from these causes.\r\n\r\n     4. Two marked periods of extreme paroxysm are observable in\r\n     each century (for the last three centuries), one greater than\r\n     the other--that of greatest number and intensity occurring\r\n     about the middle of each century, and the other towards the end\r\n     of each.\r\n\r\nAs respects season, there appear distinct indications of a maximum about\r\nthe winter solstice, and equally so of a minimum rather before the\r\nautumnal equinox. It is not improbable that there is a remote relation\r\nbetween Earthquakes and the annual march of barometric pressure.\r\n\r\nWe may expect, at present, one great Earthquake about every eight\r\nmonths, and were we possessed of a sufficient report from all parts of\r\nour globe, we should probably find scarcely a day pass without a very\r\nsensible Earthquake occurring somewhere, whilst, as regards still\r\nsmaller tremors, it might almost be said that our globe, as a whole, is\r\nscarcely ever free from them.\r\n\r\nAs respects the distribution of seismic energy in space of our earth's\r\nsurface, it is that of bands of variable and of great breadth, with\r\nsensible seismic influence extending to from 5° to 15° transversely,\r\nwhich very generally follow:\r\n\r\n     1. The lines of elevated tracts which mark and divide the great\r\n     oceanic or terra-oceanic basins (or _saucers_, as I have called\r\n     them, from their shallowness in relation to surface, in this\r\n     discussion) of the earth's surface.\r\n\r\n     2. And in so far as these are frequently the lines of mountain\r\n     chains, and these latter those of volcanic vents, so the\r\n     seismic bands are found to follow these likewise. Isolated\r\n     Volcanoes are found in these bands also.\r\n\r\n     3. While sensible seismic influence is generally limited to\r\n     the average width of the band, paroxysmal efforts are\r\n     occasionally propagated to great distances transversely beyond\r\n     that.\r\n\r\n     4. The sensible width of the band depends upon the energy\r\n     developed at each point of the length, and upon the accidental\r\n     geologic and topographic conditions along the same.\r\n\r\n     5. Seismic energy _may_ become sensible at any point of the\r\n     earth's surface, its efforts being, however, greater and more\r\n     frequent as the great lines of elevation and of volcanic\r\n     activity are approached; yet not in the inverse ratio of\r\n     distance, for many of the most frequently and terribly shaken\r\n     regions of the earth, as the east shore of the Adriatic, Syria,\r\n     Asia Minor, Northern India, etc., are at great distances from\r\n     active Volcanoes.\r\n\r\n     6. The surfaces of minimum or of no known disturbance are the\r\n     central areas of great oceanic or of terra-oceanic basins or\r\n     saucers, and the greater islands existing in shallow seas.\r\n\r\nSpace obliges me to pass unnoticed here many minor but not unimportant\r\ndeductions. The discussions as to distribution in time and space occupy\r\nseventy-two pages of this fourth and last Report, the remainder of which\r\n(thirty-one pages) embraces the description and mathematical discussion\r\nas to seismometers, to which I may refer, as comprising the most\r\ncomplete account of these instruments that has, I believe, been anywhere\r\ngiven.\r\n\r\nThe appendix to the Report comprises the entire bibliography of\r\nEarthquakes collected during those researches, and a concluding chapter\r\non desiderata, and inquiries as to ill-understood phenomena supposed to\r\nbe connected with Earthquakes.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn 1849-50, I was honoured by the request to draw up the article\r\n\"Earthquake Phenomena,\" which has appeared in the first and subsequent\r\neditions of the \"Admiralty Manual of Scientific Inquiry.\" Originally the\r\nsubject was intended to have formed part of the article on Geology,\r\nentrusted to Mr. Darwin, who consulted me upon the subject; and upon my\r\nrepresenting how much Earthquakes had, within a short time, become\r\nmatter for the mathematician and physicist, he, with a singleness of eye\r\nto science which it is but just to place on record, took the necessary\r\nsteps with the Admiralty authorities that Earthquakes should form a\r\nseparate article, and advised its being placed, as it was, in my hands.\r\nTo record this will, I believe, be sufficient justification for my\r\nreference to this article, in which a good deal of information as to\r\nSeismometry is to be found.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBy recurring to Mr. Hopkins's Report on Earthquake Theory, before\r\nremarked upon (\"Report of British Association, 1847\"), it will be seen\r\nthat the solutions of the problems which he there gives for finding the\r\ndepth of focus of shock are founded upon the _velocity of propagation_\r\nof the wave in the interior of the mass, the _apparent horizontal\r\nvelocity_ and the _horizontal direction of propagation_ at any proposed\r\npoint being known (p. 82).\r\n\r\nBy this it appears plainly that at that time Mr. Hopkins supposed that\r\nit was the _velocity of translation_ of the wave of shock that did the\r\nmischief, and not the _velocity of the wave particle_, or wave itself.\r\nAnd, further, that the former might be obtained by reference simply to\r\nthe modulus of elasticity of the rock of any given formation, as,\r\nindeed, was my own earliest view when I produced my \"Dynamics of\r\nEarthquake\" in 1846. From the remarks already made as to the vast\r\ndifference between the actual transit velocity in more or less\r\ndiscontinuous rocks--such as they occur in Nature--it will be equally\r\nobvious that Mr. Hopkins's methods, as above mentioned, are\r\nimpracticable, even were there no confusion between the velocity of\r\ntranslation of the wave and that of the wave particle or wave itself.\r\n\r\nThis applies also to the demonstration and diagram (taken from Hopkins)\r\ngiven by Professor Phillips (\"Vesuvius,\" pp. 258-259).\r\n\r\nIn December, 1857, occurred the great Neapolitan Earthquake, which\r\ndesolated a large portion of that kingdom; and an opportunity then arose\r\nfor practically applying to the problems of finding the directions of\r\nearthquake shock at a given point through which it has passed, and\r\nultimately the position and depth of focus, other methods, which I had\r\nseen, from soon after the date of publication of my original Paper\r\n(1846), were easily practicable, and the details of which I had\r\ngradually matured.\r\n\r\nBearing in mind that, in the case of the normal vibration in any elastic\r\nsolid of indefinite dimensions, the direction of motion in space of the\r\n_wave particle_ coincides in the first semiphase of the wave, and at the\r\ninstant of its _maximum velocity_ with the right line joining the\r\nparticle and the focus or centre of disturbance, it follows that, in the\r\ncase of earthquakes, the normal vibration of the wave of shock is always\r\nin a vertical plane passing through the focus and any point on the\r\nearth's surface through which the shock passes (assuming for the present\r\nno disturbing causes after the impulse has been given), and that at such\r\na point the movement of the wave particle in the first semiphase of the\r\nwave is in the same direction or sense as that of translation; and at\r\nthe moment of maximum velocity the direction in space of the motion of\r\nthe wave particle is that of the right line joining the point through\r\nwhich the wave has passed with the focus or centre of impulse.\r\n\r\nIf, therefore, we can determine the direction of motion of the wave\r\nparticle in the first semiphase, and its maximum velocity, we can\r\nobtain, from any selected point, a line (that of emergence of the shock)\r\n_somewhere in which_, if prolonged beneath the earth, the focus must\r\nhave been; and if we can obtain like results for two or more selected\r\npoints, we decide the position and the depth of the focus, which must be\r\nin the intersection of the several lines of direction of the wave\r\nparticle motion at each point, when prolonged downwards.\r\n\r\nNow, as I have said, it is the _vibration of the wave itself_, _i.e._,\r\nthe motion of the wave particle that does the mischief--_not_ the\r\ntransit of the wave from place to place on the surface; just as in the\r\nanalogous (but _not_ similar) case of a tidal wave of translation\r\nrunning up an estuary and passing a ship anchored there, it is not the\r\ntransit up the channel, but the wave form itself--_i.e._, the motion of\r\nthe wave particles--that lifts the ship, sends her a little way higher\r\nup channel, drops her to her former level, and sends her down channel\r\nagain to the spot she lay in just before the arrival of the wave.\r\n\r\nEverything, therefore, that has been permanently disturbed by an\r\nearthquake shock has been thus moved in the direction and with the\r\nmaximum velocity impressed upon it by the wave particle in the first\r\nsemiphase of the wave; and thus almost everything that has been so\r\ndisturbed may, by the application of established dynamical principles,\r\nbe made to give us more or less information as to the velocity of the\r\nwave particle (or as we, for shortness, say, the velocity of shock), the\r\ndirection of its normal vibration, and the position and depth beneath\r\nthe earth's surface, from which came the generating impulse. We thus\r\narrive at these as simply and as surely as we can infer from the\r\nposition taken by a billiard ball, on which certain forces are known to\r\nhave acted, the forces themselves and their direction; or, from a broken\r\nbeam, the pressure or the blow which fractured it.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious, then, that nearly every object disturbed, dislocated,\r\nfractured or overthrown by an earthquake shock is a sort of natural\r\nseismometer, and the best and surest of all seismometers, if we only\r\nmake a judicious choice of the objects which being found after such a\r\nshock, we shall employ for our purpose. This was the principle which I\r\nproposed to the Royal Society at once to apply to the effects of the\r\nthen quite recent great Neapolitan Earthquake of 1857, and which,\r\nthrough the liberality and aid of that body, I was enabled to employ\r\nwith the result I had pretty confidently anticipated, namely, the\r\nascertainment of the approximate depth of the focus.\r\n\r\n_Every_ shock-disturbed object in an earthquake-shaken country is\r\ncapable of giving _some_ information as to the shock that acted upon it;\r\nbut it needs a careful choice, and some mechanical [Greek: nous], to\r\nselect _proper_ and the best objects, so as to avoid the needless\r\nperplexity of disturbing forces _not_ proper to the shock, or other\r\ncomplications.\r\n\r\nWhen properly chosen, these natural seismometers, or evidences fitted\r\nfor observation after the shock, are of two great classes, by which the\r\nconditions of the earthquake motion are discoverable:\r\n\r\n     1. Fractures or dislocations (chiefly in the masonry of\r\n     buildings), which afford two principal sources and sorts of\r\n     information, namely:\r\n\r\n     _a._ From the observed _directions of fractures or fissures_,\r\n     by which the _wave path_, and frequently the _angle of\r\n     emergence_, may be immediately inferred.\r\n\r\n     _b._ Information from the preceding, united with known\r\n     conditions as to the strength of materials to resist\r\n     _fracture_, by which the _velocity_ of the fracturing impulse\r\n     may be calculated.\r\n\r\n     2. The overthrow or the projection, or both, of bodies large or\r\n     small, simple or complex. From these we are enabled to infer:\r\n\r\n     _c._ By direct observation, the _direction in azimuth_ of the\r\n     wave path.\r\n\r\n     _d._ By measurements of the horizontal and vertical distances\r\n     of overthrow or of projection, to infer either the _velocity_\r\n     of projection, or _angle of emergence_.\r\n\r\nFractures by shock present their planes always nearly in directions\r\ntransverse to the wave path. Projections or overthrow take place (unless\r\nsecondarily disturbed) in the line of the wave path, or in the vertical\r\nplane passing through it: but the direction of fall or overthrow may be\r\neither in the same direction as the wave transit (_i.e._, as the motion\r\nof the wave particle in the first semiphase), or contrary to it.\r\n\r\nIt is thus obvious that the principal phenomena presented by the effects\r\nof earthquake shock upon the objects usually occurring upon the surface\r\nof the inhabited parts of the earth, resolve themselves into problems of\r\nthree orders, and are all amenable to mechanical treatment, viz.:\r\n\r\n     1. Problems relating to the direction and amount of velocity\r\n     producing fracture or fissures.\r\n\r\n     2. Problems relating to the single or multiplied oscillations\r\n     of bodies, considered as compound pendulums.\r\n\r\n     3. Problems referable to the theory of projectiles.\r\n\r\nThese three may combine in several cases, and on the part of the\r\nobserver must combine with measurements, angular and linear, and with\r\ngeodetic operations to be conducted in the shaken country.\r\n\r\nThe methods of application in detail are described fully, as well as\r\ntheir actual application and results, in my work published in 1862 (2\r\nvols.), entitled \"The First Principles of Observational Seismology, as\r\ndeveloped in the Report to the Royal Society of London of the Expedition\r\nmade by Command of the Society into the Interior of the Kingdom of\r\nNaples, to investigate the Circumstances of the Great Earthquake of\r\nDecember, 1857,\" to the many illustrations of which the pecuniary grant,\r\nin aid, of £300 was most liberally made to the publishers (Messrs.\r\nChapman and Hall) by the Society.\r\n\r\nIt is not my intention here, nor would space allow, of my going into the\r\ndetails of observation, nor of the deductions and conclusions I have\r\nrecorded in those volumes. I have referred to their contents as marking\r\nthe advent of a new method. I have ventured to call it a new _organon_\r\nin the investigation of Earthquakes, and, through them, of the deep\r\ninterior of our earth; and will only add that the method, on this its\r\nvery first trial, proved fertile and successful. The depth of focus for\r\nthis shock of December, 1857, was about seven to eight geographical\r\nmiles below sea level, roughly stated. It gives me great pleasure to add\r\nthat my friend, Dr. Oldham, Director-General of the Geological Survey of\r\nIndia, has since applied these same methods to the phenomena of the\r\ngreat Cachar Earthquake of the 10th January, 1869, and with success. The\r\npressure of official duties has, he informs me, as yet prevented his\r\nfully working out his results, but they appear so far to indicate, as we\r\nshould expect, a depth of focus or origin considerably greater than in\r\nthe European case of 1857. Some account of Dr. Oldham's results were\r\nthis year communicated to the Geological Society of London through\r\nmyself, they are of great interest and importance.\r\n\r\nSuch, briefly and imperfectly sketched, is the existing state of\r\nSeismology. As a branch of exact science it is, as it were, an affair of\r\nyesterday. It is with reluctance that I have been compelled, in this\r\nreview, to refer to my own work so prominently. The harvest has been and\r\nstill is plenteous, but in this field of intellectual work the labourers\r\nare few. This must continue to be so as long as Geology shall continue\r\nto be viewed in public estimation (in England at least) as a fashionable\r\ntoy, that everyone who has been to school is supposed capable of\r\nhandling; and until all who profess to be geologists shall have learnt\r\nthat, to make sound progress, they must first become mathematicians,\r\nphysicists and chemists.\r\n\r\nIt is to the general imperfect knowledge of these sciences amongst\r\ngeologists that speculative errors show such vitality, and that Geology\r\nmakes such poor progress towards becoming the interpretation of the\r\nworld as a machine (_Erdkunde_).\r\n\r\nIt is for the same reason that Seismology and Vulcanology make little\r\nprogress; the first cannot be pursued beyond its present boundaries, nor\r\ncan even its present position be understood or explained by anyone\r\nunfamiliar with the laws of wave motion, of all classes of waves; and it\r\nwould be easy to show, by quoting from various British or foreign\r\ntext-books on Geology, how extremely imperfect is the grasp of some of\r\nthe authors upon the subject of earthquake-wave motion, even such as\r\nthey admit and endeavour to explain and apply: in fact, many geologists\r\nappear never to have framed to themselves any clear idea of what _is_ a\r\nwave of any sort, liquid or elastic. The general silence as to seismic\r\ntheory of French geological writers is remarkable, to whatever cause\r\nattributable. It has been said that French philosophers show themselves\r\nlittle disposed to acknowledge or to follow the lead of their foreign\r\ncompeers in any branch of science. If this be true, or in so far as it\r\nmay be so, it is unworthy of French science, which has such boundless\r\nclaims upon our homage. I am disposed to attribute the fact in this case\r\nto other circumstances; and, amongst these, to the small extent to which\r\nour language is known amongst French scientific men.\r\n\r\nGermany has shown more desire to cultivate this branch of science.\r\nAlthough, as yet, the distinct enunciation of its fundamental principles\r\nhas but sparsely found its way into her text-books, several able\r\nmonographs, such as those of Schmidt and of Höttinger, prove how\r\ncompletely some of her philosophers have mastered and how well applied\r\nthem. The men of science of Northern Italy, amongst whom so many\r\nglorious names are to be found on the roll of discovery, have shown\r\nthemselves quite alive to the importance of Seismology; and I know of no\r\nmore clear, exact and popular exposition of its principles and\r\napplication, and of its cosmical relations, than is to be found in a\r\nsmall volume by Professor Gerolamo Boccardo, published at Genoa in 1869,\r\nentitled _Sismopirologia Terremoti, Vulcani e lente oscillazione del\r\nsuolo, saggio di una teoria di Geographia Fisica_.\r\n\r\nMy object, so far, has been to mark the progress of ascertained\r\ntheoretic notions as to Seismology. I have, therefore, passed without\r\nnotice many speculative monographs, and the treatment upon Earthquakes,\r\nwhether speculative or historical, and however able, that constitutes a\r\nprominent feature of nearly all systematic works on Geology.\r\n\r\nThat which may be at present viewed as achieved and certainly\r\nascertained in theoretic Seismology is the clear conception of the\r\nnature of earthquake motion; the relations to it of great sea or other\r\nwater wave commotions; the relations to it of sound waves--as to which,\r\nhowever, more remains to be known; and the relations of all these to\r\nsecondary effects, tending in various ways to modify more or less the\r\ntopographic and other conditions of the land or sea bottom. And in\r\ndescriptive Seismology the present distribution of the earthquake bands\r\nor regions of greatest seismic prevalence and activity are tolerably\r\nascertained, and their connection with volcanic lines and those of\r\nelevation rendered more evident. Viewed alone, nothing can yet be said\r\nto be absolutely ascertained as to the immediately antecedent cause or\r\ncauses of the impulse. The function of Earthquake, as part of the\r\ncosmical machine, has become more clear, as the distinctive boundaries\r\nbetween Earthquake and permanent elevation of the earth have been made\r\nevident; and it has been seen that Earthquake, however contemporaneous\r\noccasionally with permanent elevation, is not the cause, though it may\r\nbe one of the consequences of the same forces which produce elevation;\r\nand thus, that an infinite number of Earthquakes, however violent, and\r\nacting through however prolonged a time, can never act as an agent of\r\npermanent elevation, unless, indeed, on that minute scale in which\r\nsurface elevation may arise from secondary effects, like that of the\r\nUllah Bund.\r\n\r\nMuch remains to be done, and much may be expected even from the\r\ncontinuation, if done in a systematic and organised manner, of the\r\nstatistic record of Earthquakes in connection with those other branches\r\nof cosmical statistics, Climatology, Meteorology, Terrestrial Magnetism,\r\netc., the observation of which is already, to a certain extent,\r\norganised over a large portion of the globe.\r\n\r\nAnd now let us look back for a moment to ask, How, by what mental path\r\nof discovery, have we arrived at what we have passed in review?\r\n\r\nThe facts of Earthquakes have been before men for unknown ages \"open\r\nsecrets,\" as Nature's facts have been well called; \"but eyes had they\r\nand saw not.\" Facts viewed through the haze of superstition, or of\r\nforegone notions of what Nature _ought_ to do, cease to be facts. When,\r\nafter the great Calabrian Earthquake of 1783, the Royal Academy of\r\nNaples sent forth its commission of its learned members to examine into\r\nthe effects, they had spread around them in sad profusion all that was\r\nnecessary to have enabled them to arrive at a true notion of the nature\r\nof the shock, and thence a sound explanation of the varied and great\r\nsecondary effects they witnessed, and of which they have left us the\r\nrecords in their Report, and the engravings illustrative of it. But we\r\nlook in vain for any light; the things seen, often with distortion or\r\nexaggeration, are heaped together as in the phantasmagoria of a wild\r\nand terrible dream, from which neither order nor conclusion follow.\r\n\r\nWhy was this? Why were these eminent _savants_ no more successful in\r\nexplaining what they saw than the ignorant peasants they found in the\r\nCalabrian mountains?\r\n\r\nBecause physical science itself was not sufficiently advanced, no doubt;\r\nbut also because they had no notion of applying such science as they\r\nhad, to the very central point itself of the main problem before them,\r\nfreed from all possible adventitious conditions, and so, as it were,\r\nattacking it in the rear. How different might have been the result of\r\ntheir labours, had they begun by asking themselves, What is an\r\nearthquake? Can we not try to find out what it _is_ by observing and\r\n_measuring_ what it has done? We see the converse mode of dealing with\r\nNature in Torricelli. \"Nature abhors a vacuum,\" was told him, as the\r\nwisdom of his day. Possibly: but her abhorrence is limited, for I find\r\nit is _measured_ by the pressure of a column of water of thirty-four\r\nfeet in height. We need not pursue the story with Pascal, up to the top\r\nof the Puy de Dôme.\r\n\r\nThis lesson is instructive generally to all investigators, and\r\nparticularly here; for Vulcanology, to which we are about now to turn,\r\nhas occupied until almost to-day much the same position that Seismology\r\ndid in those of the Neapolitan Commissioners.\r\n\r\nWhole libraries have been written with respect to it dealing with\r\n_quality_, but _measure_ and _quantity_ remain to be applied to it.\r\n\r\nTo a very preponderant class in the civilised world no knowledge is of\r\nmuch interest or value that does not point to what is called a\r\n\"practical result,\" one measurable into utility or coin. I do not stop\r\nto remark as to the bad or as to certain good results of this tendency\r\nof mind; but I may venture to point out to all, that the exact knowledge\r\nof the nature of earthquake motion, even during the short time that it\r\nhas become known, has not been barren in results absolutely practical\r\nand utilitarian. The minute investigation of the destruction of\r\nbuildings, etc., and the deductions that have been made as to the\r\nrelations between the form, height, materials, methods of building,\r\ncombination of timber and of masonry, and many other architectural or\r\nconstructive conditions, have made it certain now that earthquake-proof\r\nhouses and other edifices can be constructed with facility, and at no\r\ngreat increase, if any at all, of cost. I can affirm that there is no\r\nphysical necessity why in frequently and violently shaken countries,\r\nsuch as Southern Italy or the Oriental end generally of the\r\nMediterranean, victims should hereafter continue by thousands to be\r\nsacrificed by the fall of their ill-designed and badly built houses.\r\n\r\nWere a \"Building Act\" properly framed, put in force by the Italian\r\nGovernment in the Basilicatas and Capitanata, etc., so that new houses\r\nor existing ones, when rebuilt, should be so in accordance with certain\r\nsimple rules, a not very distant time can be foreseen when Earthquakes,\r\npassing through these rich and fertile but now frequently sorely\r\nafflicted regions, should come and go, having left but little trace of\r\nruin or death behind. Some disasters there must always be, for we\r\ncannot make the flanks of mountains, nor the beds of torrents, etc.,\r\nalways secure; but the main mortality of all Earthquakes is in the\r\nhouses or other inhabited buildings. Make these proof, and the wholesale\r\nslaughter is at an end.\r\n\r\nThe principles we have established have been thus practically applied in\r\nanother direction. The Japanese Government, with the keen and rapid\r\nperception of the powers inherent in European science which\r\ncharacterises now that wonderful people, has commenced to illuminate its\r\ncoasts by lighthouses constructed after the best European models. But\r\nJapan is greatly convulsed by earthquakes, and lighthouses, as being\r\nlofty buildings, are peculiarly liable to be destroyed by them.\r\n\r\nThe engineer of the Japanese Government for these lights, Mr. Thomas\r\nStevenson, C.E. (one of the engineers to the Commissioners of Northern\r\nLights), was instructed to have regard, in the design of those\r\nlighthouses, to their exposure to shock. I was consulted by Mr.\r\nStevenson as to the general principles to be observed; and those\r\nedifices have been constructed so that they are presumedly proof against\r\nthe most violent shocks likely to visit Japan; not, perhaps, upon the\r\nbest possible plan, but upon such as is truly based upon the principles\r\nI have developed. Mr. Stevenson has published some account of their\r\nconstruction.\r\n\r\nThe earthquake regions of South America might with incalculable benefit\r\napply those ideas; and, indeed, they have been, to some extent, already\r\napplied by my friend, Mr. William Lloyd, Member of the Institution of\r\nCivil Engineers, to the New Custom Houses constructed from his designs\r\nat Valparaiso.\r\n\r\nAs one of these utilitarian views, and an important one, it will occur\r\nto many to ask--Can the moment of the occurrence or the degree of\r\nintensity of earthquake shock be predicted, or is it probable that at a\r\nfuture day we may be able to predict them? At present, any prediction,\r\neither of the one or the other, is impossible; and those few who have\r\nprofessed themselves in possession of sufficient grounds for such\r\nprediction are deceivers or deceived. Nor is it likely that, for very\r\nmany years to come, if ever, science shall have advanced so as to render\r\nany such prediction possible; but it is neither impossible nor\r\nimprobable that the time shall arrive when, within certain, perhaps\r\nwide, limits as to space, previous time, and instant of occurrence, such\r\nforewarnings may be obtainable.\r\n\r\nEarthquakes, like storms and tempests, and nearly all changes of\r\nweather, are not periodic phenomena, nor yet absolutely uncertain or, so\r\nto say, accidental as to recurrence.\r\n\r\nThey are quasi-periodic, that is to say, some of their conditions as to\r\ncausation rest upon a really periodic basis, as, for example, the\r\nrecurrence of storms upon the periodic march of the earth, and sun and\r\nmoon, etc., and the recurrence of Earthquakes upon the secular cooling\r\nof our earth; but the conditions in both are so numerous and complicated\r\nwith particulars, that we cannot fully analyse them--hence, cannot\r\nreduce the phenomena to law, and so cannot predict recurrence. Yet\r\nstorms and tempests--which were, along with pestilences and Earthquakes,\r\namongst the natural phenomena which Bishop Butler deemed in his own day\r\nimpossible of human prediction--have already, through the persistent and\r\nsystematised efforts of meteorological observers, become to a certain\r\nextent foreseeable; and medical science assures us that it has rendered\r\nthat, though to a much less degree of probability, true of pestilences.\r\n\r\nWe may, therefore, give the utilitarian some hope, that if he will help\r\nus along--who value our accessions of knowledge primarily upon a\r\ndifferent standard to his--in our talk of discovery, our posterity, in a\r\ncentury or two hence, may not improbably possess the advantage of being\r\nable, in some degree, to predict their Earthquakes. I fear the\r\ninducement will go but a small way with the utilitarian generation,\r\nwhose bent tends much towards asking, \"What has posterity ever done for\r\nthem?\"\r\n\r\nBut though we cannot as yet predict the time when an Earthquake may take\r\nplace in any locality, we can, on mixed statistic and dynamic grounds,\r\nin many cases state the limits of probable violence of the next that may\r\nrecur. For example, the three shafts of marble columns of the Temple of\r\nSerapis, at Pozzuoli, each of about 41-1/2 feet in height, and 4 feet 10\r\ninches in diameter at the base, remain standing alone, since they were\r\nuncovered, in the year 1750.\r\n\r\nNow, as we can calculate exactly what velocity of earthquake-wave motion\r\nwould be required to overset these, we are certain that, during the last\r\none hundred and twenty-two years, the site of the Temple, and we may\r\nsay Naples and the Phlegræan fields generally, have never experienced a\r\nshock as great as the very moderate one that would overset these\r\ncolumns. A shock whose wave particle had a horizontal velocity of only\r\nabout 3-1/2 feet (British) per second would overturn these columns;\r\nwhich is only about one-fourth the velocity (within the meizoseismic\r\narea) of the great shock of 1857, that produced wide-spread destruction\r\nin the Basilicatas, and not enough to throw down any reasonably\r\nwell-built house of moderate height.\r\n\r\nNaples, so far as Earthquake is concerned, whether coming from the\r\nthroes of Vesuvius or elsewhere, has a pretty good chance of safety. She\r\nmay possibly (though not probably) be some day smothered in ashes; but\r\nis in little danger of being shaken to the earth. During this time there\r\nhave been taking place, larger eruptions of Vesuvius and earthquake\r\nshocks from other centres, together probably about the same number of\r\ntimes as the numbers of those years, when those columns have been more\r\nor less shaken.\r\n\r\nWe may therefore affirm that the probability (on the basis of this\r\nexperience _only_) is, say 120 to 1, that the next shock, whether\r\nderived from Vesuvius, or elsewhere, that may shake Pozzuoli, will be\r\none less in power than would be needed to overturn the shafts of the\r\nTemple of Serapis there.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLet us now turn to the second branch of our subject--viz.,\r\nVulcanology--upon which, as yet, we have secured less firm standing\r\nground than we have seen we possess in Seismology, for which reason we\r\ntook that first into consideration.\r\n\r\nIt is the part of Vulcanology to co-ordinate and explain all the\r\nphenomena of past or present times visible on our globe which are\r\nevidences of the existence and action, whether local or general, of\r\ntemperatures within our globe greatly in excess of those of the surface,\r\nand which reach the fusing points of various mineral compounds as found\r\narriving, heated or fused, at the surface.\r\n\r\nThe stratigraphic geologist sees that such heated or fused masses have\r\ncome up from beneath, throughout every epoch that he can trace; but he\r\ncannot fail to discern more or less a change in the order or character\r\nof those outcomings, as he traces them from the lowest and oldest\r\nformations to those of the present day. He sees immense outpourings of\r\ngranitoid or porphyrytic rocks that have welled up and overflowed the\r\noldest strata--huge dykes filling miles of fissures that had been\r\npreviously opened for the reception of the molten matter that has filled\r\nthem, and often passing through those masses of previously outpoured\r\nrock; later he sees huge tables of basaltic rock poured forth over all.\r\nOne grand characteristic common to all these--commonly called plutonic\r\nproducts--being that, whether they were poured forth over the surface or\r\ninjected into cavities in other rocks, the movements of the fused\r\nmaterial were, on the whole, hydrostatic and _not explosive_.\r\n\r\nAt the present day, whatever other evidences we have of high temperature\r\nbelow our globe's surface, that which primarily fixes the eye of the\r\ngeologist is the Volcano, whose characteristic, as we see it in\r\nactivity, _is explosive_. But though there is this great characteristic\r\ndifference between the plutonic and the volcanic actions and their\r\nproducts, the two, when looked at largely, are seen so to inosculate,\r\nthat it is impossible not to refer them to an agency common to both,\r\nhowever changed the modes of its action have been between the earliest\r\nepochs of which traces are presented to us and the present day.\r\n\r\nTo us little men, who, as Herschell has well said, in referring to the\r\nmethods of measuring the size of our globe, \"can never see it all at\r\nonce, but must creep like mites about its surface,\" the Volcano, in the\r\nstupendous grandeur of its effects, tends to fix itself in our minds in\r\nexaggerated proportions to its true place in the cosmic machine; and, in\r\nfact, nearly all who have sought to expound its nature and mode of\r\norigination have occupied themselves far too exclusively with describing\r\nand theorising upon the strange and varied phenomena which the volcanic\r\ncone itself and its eruptions present, and too often, in the splendour\r\nand variety of these, have very much lost sight of what ought to be the\r\ncentre-point of all such studies, namely, to arrive at some sound\r\nknowledge of what is the _primum mobile_ of all these wonderful efforts.\r\nNor has the distinction been very clearly seen between the main\r\nphenomena presented at and about volcanic active mouths, which can be\r\nemployed to elucidate the nature of the causation at work far below, and\r\nthose most varied and curious, and in other respects most pregnant and\r\ninstructive phenomena, mechanical and chemical, which are called into\r\naction in and by the ejected matter of the volcanic cone after its\r\nejection. It can help us but little or very indirectly, in getting at a\r\ntrue conception of the nature and source of the heat itself of the\r\nVolcano, to examine, for example, all the curious circumstances that are\r\nseen in the movements and changes in the lava that has already flowed\r\nfrom its mouth; but it would be of great importance if we can ascertain,\r\nby any form of observation around the cone, from what depth it has come,\r\nor at what depth the igneous origin lies.\r\n\r\nThe physician, endeavouring to ascertain the real nature of small-pox or\r\nmeasles, will scarcely make much progress who, however curiously or\r\nminutely, confines his attention to the pustules that he sees upon the\r\nskin.\r\n\r\nYet the Volcano, or rather all volcanic activity as now operative upon\r\nour globe, is, as it were, an experiment of Nature's own perpetually\r\ngoing on before us, the results of which, if well chosen--that is, as\r\nBacon says, by keeping to the main and neglecting the accidents--can,\r\nwhen colligated and correctly reasoned upon, in relation to our planet\r\nas a whole, give us the key to the enigma of terrestrial Vulcanicity in\r\nits most general sense, and at every epoch of our world's geognostic\r\nhistory, and show us its true place and use in the cosmical machine. Let\r\nus glance at the history of past speculation on this subject, from which\r\nso little real knowledge is to be derived, and then at the salient facts\r\nof Vulcanology as now seen upon our earth, and finally see if we can\r\nconnect these with other great cosmical conditions, so as to arrive at\r\na consistent explanation in harmony with all.\r\n\r\nWe gain nothing absolutely from the knowledge of the so-called\r\n\"ancients\" as to Volcanoes in Europe at least, where alone historic\r\nrecords likely to refer to them exist. The Volcanoes of Europe are few\r\nand widely scattered. The Greeks saw but little of them, and the Romans\r\nwere all and at all times most singularly unobservant of natural\r\nphenomena.\r\n\r\nCæsar never mentions the existence in France of the Volcanoes of\r\nAuvergne, so much like those he must have seen in Italy and Sicily; and\r\nRoman writers pass in silence that great volcanic region, though\r\ninhabited by them, and their language impressed upon the places, as\r\nVolvic (_volcano-vicus_) seems with others to indicate; and though there\r\nis some reason to believe that one or other of the Puys was in activity\r\nwithin the first five hundred years of our epoch, the notices which\r\nHumboldt and others have collected as from Plato, Pausanius, Pliny,\r\nOvid, etc., teach nothing.\r\n\r\nWhatever of mere speculation there may have been, volcanic theory, or\r\nwhat has passed for such, there was none before 1700, when Léméry\r\nbrought forward a trivial experiment, the acceptance of which, even for\r\na moment, as a sufficient cause for volcanic heat (and it retarded other\r\nor truer views for years), we can now only wonder at. Breislak's origin,\r\nin the burning of subterranean petroleum or like combustibles, was\r\nscarcely less absurd than Léméry's sulphur and iron filings.\r\n\r\nDavy, in the plenitude of his fame, and full of the intense chemical\r\nactivities of the metals of the alkalies which he had just isolated,\r\nthrew a new but transient verisimilitude upon the so-called chemical\r\ntheory of Volcanoes, by ascribing the source of heat to the oxidation of\r\nthose metals assumed to exist in vast, unproved and unindicated masses\r\nin the interior of the earth. But Davy had too clear an intellect not to\r\nsee the baseless nature of his own hypothesis, which in his last work,\r\nthe \"Consolations in Travel,\" he formally recanted; and it only survived\r\nhim in the long-continued though unconvincing advocacy of Dr. Daubeny.\r\nSo far, the origin of the heat had been sought always, in the crude\r\nnotion of some sort of _fuel consumed_, whether that were petroleum or\r\npotassium and sodium; but as no fuel was to be found, nor any indicated\r\nby the products, so far as known, of the volcanic heat, so what has been\r\ncalled the mechanical theory, in a variety of shapes, took its place.\r\n\r\nThis, in whatever form, takes its lava and other heated products of the\r\nvolcano ready made from a universal ocean of liquid material, which it\r\nsupposes constitutes the interior or nucleus of our globe, and which is\r\nonly skinned over by a thin, solid crust of cooled and consolidated\r\nrock, which was variably estimated at from fourteen to perhaps fifty\r\nmiles in thickness. Here was a boundless supply of more than heat, of\r\nhot lava ready made, the existence of which at these moderate depths the\r\nthen state of knowledge of hypogeal temperature, which was supposed to\r\ngo on increasing with depth at the rate of about 1° Fahrenheit, for\r\nevery thirty or forty feet, seemed quite to sustain.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty remained, how was this fiery ocean brought to the\r\nsurface or far above it? To account for this two main notions prevailed,\r\nand, indeed, have not ceased to prevail. Some unknown elastic gases or\r\nvapour forced it up through fissures or rents pre-existent, or produced\r\nby the tension of the elastic and liquid pressure below.\r\n\r\nThe form in which this view took most consistency, and approaching most\r\nnearly to truth, finds the elastic vapour in steam generated from water\r\npassed down through fissures from the sea or from the land surface. But\r\nto this the difficulty was started, that fissures that could let down\r\nwater would pass up steam. The objection, when all the conditions are\r\nadequately considered, has really no weight; and it has been completely\r\ndisposed of, since within a few years it has been proved that capillary\r\ninfiltration goes on in all porous rocks to enormous depths, and that\r\nthe capillary passages in such media, though giving free vent to\r\nwater--and the more as the water is warmer--are, when once filled with\r\nliquid, proof against the return through them of gases or vapours. So\r\nthat the deeply seated walls of the ducts leading to the crater, if of\r\nsuch material, may be red hot and yet continue to pass water from every\r\npore (like the walls of a well in chalk), which is flushed off into\r\nsteam that cannot return by the way the water came down, and must reach\r\nthe surface again, if at all, by the duct and crater, overcoming in its\r\nway whatever obstructions they may be filled with.\r\n\r\nAnd this remarkable property of capillarity sufficiently shows how the\r\nlava--fused below or even at or above the level of infiltration--may\r\nbecome interpenetrated throughout its mass by steam bubbles, as it\r\nusually but not invariably is found to be.\r\n\r\nNor is it difficult to see such a mechanism between volcanic ducts and\r\nfissures conveying down water, as large and open pipes, for a large part\r\nof their depth, as shall bring down water to foci of volcanic heat,\r\nwithout the power of the water flowing back except as steam and through\r\nthe crater.\r\n\r\nIndeed, the facts known as to geysers, and those of half-drowned-out\r\nVolcanoes such as Stromboli--whose action is intermittent just as much\r\nas that of a geyser--show that this is not merely probable. There is,\r\ntherefore, no need for the hypothesis of those who have supposed all the\r\nhuge volumes of steam blown off from Volcanoes in eruption to come from\r\nvesicular water pre-existent in the minute cavities of crystalline or\r\nother rocks before their fusion into lava: a fact not proved for many\r\nclasses of rock, and for none in sufficient quantity to account for the\r\nvast volume of steam required and for the irregularity of its issue.\r\n\r\nIt is rather to anticipate, but I may state at once that, so far as the\r\nadmission of superficial waters to the interior, and to any depth to\r\nwhich fissures or dislocation can extend, I believe no valid physical or\r\nmechanical difficulties exist, taking into account _all_ the conditions\r\nthat may come into play together.\r\n\r\nAnother set of views has been suggested and supported by various\r\nwriters, which proposes to account for the rise of lava on purely\r\nhydrostatic principles. The solid crust, fractured into isolated\r\nfragments by tensions due to its own contraction, is supposed to sink\r\ninto the sea of lava on which it floats; and much ingenuity has been\r\nexpended in imagining the mechanism by which, in places, the liquid\r\nmatter is supposed to rise _above_ the surface of the crust.\r\n\r\nI have no space for discussing these views further than to assert that,\r\nin the existing state of our globe, and even admitting a solid crust of\r\nonly 60,000 metres thick, dislocation of the crust by _tension_ is not\r\npossible. The solid crust of our globe, as I hope we shall see further\r\non, is not in a state of tension, and has not been so since it was\r\nextremely thin, a mere pellicle as compared with the liquid nucleus, but\r\nis, on the contrary, in a state of _tangential compression_.\r\n\r\nHowever tenable, in other respects, may be the volcanic theory which\r\nrests upon the assumption of a very _thin_ crust and a universal ocean\r\nof fused rock beneath, it fails wholly to explain many of the most\r\nimportant circumstances observable as to the distribution and movements\r\nof existing Volcanoes on our globe.\r\n\r\nIt affords no adequate explanation of the configuration of the lines of\r\nVolcanoes, nor of their occurrence in the ocean bed, nor of their\r\nexistence in high latitudes, near the Poles, where, no matter how or at\r\nwhat rate our globe cooled from liquidity, the crust must be thickest;\r\nnor of the independence of eruptive action of closely adjacent volcanic\r\nvents; nor of the non-periodicity, the sudden awakening-up to activity,\r\nthe as sudden exhaustion, the long repose, the gradual decay of action\r\nat particular vents, and of much more that might be stated and\r\nsustained as difficulties left by that theory unexplained, or that are\r\nof a nature even opposed to it.\r\n\r\nThe researches of the last few years have, however, as it appears to me,\r\nrendered any theory that demands as its postulates a _very thin crust_,\r\nand a universal liquid nucleus beneath it, absolutely untenable.\r\n\r\nWithout attaching any importance to the arguments of Mr. Hopkins, based\r\nupon precession and nutation, it appears to me, on various other\r\ngrounds, some of which have been urged by Sir William Thompson, that the\r\nearth's solid crust is not a thin one, at least not thin enough to\r\nrender it conceivable that water can ever gain admission to a fluid\r\nnucleus, if any such still exist, situated at so great a depth; and\r\nwithout such access we can have no Volcano. It is not necessary to go to\r\nthe extent of a crust of 800 or 1,000 miles thick: with one of half the\r\nminor thickness, I believe it may be proved, on various grounds,\r\nhydraulic amongst others, that neither water could reach the nucleus,\r\nnor the liquid matter of the nucleus reach the surface. Mr. Hopkins\r\nhaving proved to his own satisfaction an enormous thickness for the\r\ncrust, and seeing clearly the difficulties that this involved to the\r\ngenerally accepted volcanic theory, and having no other to substitute\r\nfor it, fell back upon that most vague and weak notion of the existence\r\nof isolated lakes of liquid rock, existing at comparatively small depths\r\nbeneath the earth's surface within the solid and relatively cold crust,\r\neach supplying its own Volcano, or more than one, with ready-made lava.\r\nWhat is to produce these lakes of fused matter in the midst of similar\r\nsolidified matter? what is perpetually to maintain their fluidity in the\r\nmidst of solid matter continually cooling? what has given them their\r\nlocal position? why near or less near the surface? what should have\r\narranged them in directions stretching in some cases nearly from Pole to\r\nPole?\r\n\r\nSurely this creation of imaginary lakes, merely because it happens to\r\nfit the vacant chink that seems needed to wedge up a falling theory, is\r\nan instance of that abuse of hypothesis against which Newton so\r\nvehemently declaims--\"_Hypotheses non fingo._\"\r\n\r\nHypothesis, to be a philosophic scaffolding to knowledge, must, as\r\nWhewell has said, \"be close to the facts, and not merely connected with\r\nthem by arbitrary and untried facts.\" Yet this appears accepted by Lyell\r\n(10th edition, Vol. II., p. 227, and elsewhere); by Phillips\r\n(\"Vesuvius,\" pp. 331, 332); by Scrope, if, as I hope, I mistake him not\r\n(\"Volcanoes,\" pp. 265, 307-8); though none of these excellent\r\nauthorities seem either quite clear or quite satisfied with the notion;\r\nand in the very passage referred to, Lyell _may_ have possibly a much\r\nmore philosophic notion in view, where he says: \"It is only necessary,\r\nin order to explain the action of Volcanoes, to _discover some cause\r\nwhich is capable of bringing about such a concentration of heat as may\r\nmelt one after the other certain portions of the solid crust_, so as to\r\nform seas, lakes or oceans of subterraneous lava.\" (Vol. II, pp. 226,\r\n227). If by this is meant, that all that is needed to complete a true\r\ntheory of volcanic action is to discover _an adequate cosmical cause for\r\nthe heat_--that is to say, a prime mover to which all its phenomena may\r\nbe traced back, which shall be at once reconcilable with the conditions\r\nof our planet as a cooling mass in space and with facts of Vulcanology\r\nas they are now seen upon it--then I entirely agree with it.\r\n\r\nIt has been my own object to endeavour to discover and develope that\r\nadequate cause in a Paper \"On Volcanic Energy, an Attempt to develope\r\nits True Nature and Cosmical Relations,\" read (in abstract) before the\r\nRoyal Society of London (\"Proceedings, Royal Society,\" Vol. XX., May,\r\n1872), and now (October, 1872) under consideration of Council with a\r\nview to publication.\r\n\r\nI propose concluding this review of the progress of Vulcanology (in\r\nwhich I have had to limit myself to reviewing merely the chief stages of\r\nadvance towards knowledge of the nature and origin of volcanic heat\r\nitself, and have had to pass without notice the vast and important mass\r\nof facts and reasonings collected by so many labourers as to its visible\r\nphenomena and products, and the still greater mass of speculation, good\r\nand bad, on every branch of the subject), by giving a necessarily very\r\nbrief and imperfect sketch of my own views as in that Paper in part\r\ndeveloped. It will first be necessary to retrace our steps a little, in\r\norder to gain such a point as shall afford us a fuller view of the whole\r\nproblem before us.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to dilate, even did space allow, upon the many\r\npoints which bind together Earthquakes and Volcanoes as belonging to the\r\nplay of like forces. These are generally admitted; and in various ways,\r\nmore or less obscure, geologists generally have supposed some relations\r\nbetween these and the forces of elevation, which have raised up mountain\r\nchains, etc.\r\n\r\nNo one, however, that I am aware of, prior to myself, in the Paper just\r\nalluded to, has attempted to show, still less to prove upon an\r\nexperimental basis, that all the phenomena of elevation, of volcanic\r\naction, and of Earthquakes, are explicable as parts of one simple\r\nmachinery--namely, the play of forces resulting from the secular cooling\r\nof our globe. We have seen that, on the whole, both Earthquakes and\r\nVolcanoes follow along the great lines of elevation of our surface. Any\r\ntrue solution of the play of forces which has produced any one of those\r\nthree classes of phenomena must connect itself with them all, and be\r\nadequate to account for all. And this would have earlier been seen, had\r\ngeologists generally framed for themselves any correct notions of the\r\nmechanism of elevation itself, and seen its real relation with the\r\nsecular cooling of our planet. But the play of forces resulting from\r\nthis secular cooling has never, until very recently, been adequately or\r\ntruly stated. The arbitrary assumption and neglect of several essential\r\nconditions by La Place, in his celebrated Paper \"On the Cooling of the\r\nEarth,\" in the fifth volume of the \"Mécanique Céleste,\" and the\r\narbitrary and unsustainable hypothesis of Poisson upon the same subject,\r\nhave tended to retard the progress of physical Geology as to the nature\r\nof elevation: the first, by leaving the geologist in doubt as to whether\r\nour globe were cooling at all; the second, by suggesting distorted\r\nnotions as to the mode of its cooling and consolidation. On the other\r\nhand, neither geologists nor mathematicians generally have framed for\r\nthemselves any clear notions of the mechanism of elevation. Had a true\r\nconception been formed of the forces and interior movements brought\r\nnecessarily into operation by the secular cooling of the globe,\r\ngeologists could scarcely have failed to see that their notion as to the\r\nway and direction in which the forces producing elevation have actually\r\nacted could not, if arising from refrigeration, be those which they have\r\nalmost universally supposed, namely--some force acting vertically\r\nupwards, _i.e._, radially from the centre of the sphere. Had geologists\r\nonly looked at Nature with open eye, they must have seen that mountain\r\nranges, and elevations generally (exclusive of volcanic cones),\r\npresented circumstances absolutely incompatible with their having been\r\nthrust up by any force _primarily_ acting in the direction of a radius\r\nto the spheroid.\r\n\r\nYet this is the erroneous notion of the mechanism of elevation which to\r\nthe present hour prevails amongst geologists, so far as they in general\r\nhave framed to themselves any distinct idea of such mechanism at all.\r\n\r\nThus, only to cite two examples from recent authors of justly high\r\nreputation. Lyell says of the probable subterranean sources, whether of\r\nupward or downward movement, when permanently uplifting a country, and\r\nin reference to the crumpling of strata on mountain flanks by lateral\r\npressure, it would be rash to assume these able to resist a power of\r\nsuch stupendous energy, \"_if its direction, instead of being vertical_,\r\nhappened to be oblique or horizontal.\" This is somewhat vague--and I\r\ntrust I do not mistake or misrepresent the illustrious author--yet it\r\nis the most explicit expression I can find in the \"Principles of\r\nGeology\" as to his notion of the primary direction of elevatory force\r\n(Edit. 10, Vol. I., p. 133). That Mr. Scrope's idea is that only of\r\nprimary radial or vertical direction of such forces, is apparent on\r\ninspecting his Diagram No. 64 (\"Volcanoes,\" p. 285), and in the use of\r\nthe words, \"an axial wedge of granite,\" which, on the next page, we find\r\nis \"liquefied granite;\" and if we read on to page 294, and refer also to\r\npages 50 and 51, I believe there can be no doubt that _vertical_ or\r\n_direct up-thrust_ is the author's notion of the primary direction of\r\nall forces of elevation. The true nature of these forces was, however,\r\nclearly seen and most justly stated by Constant Prevost (\"Compt. Rend.,\"\r\nTome XXXI., 1850, and \"Bulletin de la Société Géolog. de France,\" Tome\r\nII., 1840) as consisting, not in forces of some unknown origin acting\r\nprimarily in the vertical, but in _tangential pressures acting\r\nhorizontally, and resolved by mutual pressures at certain points into\r\nvertical resultants_. These Prevost rightly attributed to the\r\ncontraction of the earth's solid crust. The same idea has been adopted\r\nby Elie de Beaumont as the true mechanism of the elevation of mountain\r\nranges; and although De Beaumont's views as to the thinness he assigns\r\nto the solid and contracting crust, and his strange deduction as to the\r\nparallelism of contemporaneous mountain chains uplifted by its spasmodic\r\naction along certain lines, may be untenable, his notion generally as to\r\nthe play of forces producing mountain elevation is much more nearly\r\ncorrect.\r\n\r\nMr. Hopkins's notion is simply that of the geologists. Anyone who reads\r\nhis well-known papers on elevation and the formation of fissures, etc.,\r\nmust see that he views all elevatory forces as of liquids or\r\nquasi-liquids forced up and acting primarily _vertically_ upon the\r\nstrata above them, and that these strata are not under tangential\r\ncompression, but under tension. Hence the mathematical deductions\r\ncontained in those papers as to the directions in which elevatory forces\r\nact, and in which fissures are formed by them, are not in any way a\r\nsetting forth of such facts as occur in Nature, and, much attention as\r\nthey have attracted, can only now be viewed as exercises of mathematical\r\nskill misapplied, because based upon data not to be found in Nature. In\r\nfact, those papers do but misrepresent Nature, and, like many other\r\nmathematical investigations based on untrue or insufficient data, have\r\ntended to retard knowledge.\r\n\r\nThe views which I have put forward in the Paper I have referred to, read\r\nto the Royal Society, recapitulated in skeleton, so to say, are as\r\nfollows. Omitting those portions which treat of our globe from the\r\nperiod of the first liquefaction out of a nebulous condition, and of the\r\nearliest stages of the cooling by radiation into space, when the crust\r\nwas extremely thin, and of the deformation of the spheroid as one of the\r\nfirst effects of its contraction, and through that the general shaping\r\nout of continents and ocean beds; I have endeavoured to show that the\r\nrate of contraction of the crust, while very thin, exceeded that of the\r\nlarge fluid nucleus supporting it, and so gave rise to _tangential\r\ntensions_ in the crust, and fracturing it into segments; next, that as\r\nthe crust thickened, these _tensions_ were gradually converted into\r\n_tangential pressures_, the contraction of the nucleus now beginning to\r\nexceed (for equal losses of heat) that of the crust through which it\r\ncooled. At this stage these tangential pressures gave rise to the\r\n_chief_ elevations of mountain chains--not by liquid matter by any\r\nprocess being injected from beneath vertically, but by such pressures,\r\nmutually reacting along certain lines, being resolved into the vertical,\r\nand forcing upwards more or less of the crust itself. The great outlines\r\nof the mountain ranges and the greater elevation of the land were\r\ndesignated and formed during the long periods that elapsed in which the\r\ncontinually increasing thickness of crust remained such that it was\r\nstill, as a whole, flexible enough, or opposed sufficiently little\r\nresistance to crushing, to admit of this uprise of mountain chains by\r\nresolved tangential pressures. I have shown that the simple mechanism of\r\nsuch tangential pressures is competent to account for all the complex\r\nphenomena both of the elevations and of the _depressions_ that we now\r\nsee on the earth's surface (other than continents and ocean beds),\r\nincluding the production of gaping fissures (in directions generally\r\northogonal to those of tangential pressure). And as our earth is still a\r\ncooling body, and the crust, however now thicker and more rigid, is\r\nstill incapable of sustaining the tangential pressures to which it is\r\nnow exposed, so I by no means infer that slow and small (relatively)\r\nmovements of elevation and depression may not be still and now going on\r\nupon the earth's surface; in fact all the phenomena of elevation and\r\ndepression, rending, etc., which at a much remoter epoch acted upon a\r\nmuch grander and more effective scale. So that, for aught my views say\r\nto the contrary, all the mountain chains in the world may be possibly\r\nincreasing in stature year by year, or at times; but in any case at a\r\nrate almost infinitesimally small in its totality over the whole earth\r\nto that with which their ridges were originally upreared.\r\n\r\nBut the thickness of the earth's crust--thus constantly added to, by\r\naccretion of solidifying matter from the still liquid or pasty nucleus,\r\nas the whole mass has cooled--has now assumed such a thickness as to be\r\nable to offer a too considerable resistance to the tangential pressures,\r\nto admit of its giving way to any large extent by resolution upwards;\r\nyet the cooling of the whole mass is going on, and contraction, though\r\nunequal, both of thick crust and of hotter nucleus beneath also, whether\r\nthe latter be _now_ liquid or not. Were the contraction, lineal or\r\ncubical, for equal decrements or losses of heat, or in equal\r\ntimes--equal both in the material of the solidified crust and in that of\r\nthe hotter nucleus--there could be no such tangential pressures as are\r\nhere referred to, at any epoch of the earth's cooling. But in accordance\r\nwith the facts of experimental physics, we know that the co-efficient of\r\ncontraction for all bodies is greater as their actual temperature is\r\nhigher, and this both in their solid and liquid states.\r\n\r\nHence for equal decrements of heat, or by the cooling in equal times,\r\nthe hotter nucleus contracts more than does its envelope of solid\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\nThe result is now, as at all periods since the signs changed of the\r\ntangential forces thus brought into play--_i.e._, since they became\r\ntangential _pressures_--that the nucleus tends to shrink away as it\r\nwere from beneath the crust, and to leave the latter, unsupported or but\r\npartially supported, as a spheroidal dome above it.\r\n\r\nNow what happens? If the hollow spheroidal shell were strong enough to\r\nsustain, as a spheric dome, the tangential thrust of its own weight and\r\nthe attraction of the nucleus, the shell would be left behind altogether\r\nby the nucleus, and the latter might be conceived as an independent\r\nglobe revolving, centrally or excentrically, within a shell outside of\r\nit. This, however, is not what happens.\r\n\r\nThe question then arises, Can the solid shell support the tangential\r\nthrust to which it would be thus exposed? By the application to this\r\nproblem of an elegant theorem of Lagrange, I have proved that it cannot\r\npossibly do so, no matter what may be its thickness nor what its\r\nmaterial, even were we to assume the latter not merely of the hardest\r\nand most resistant rocks we know anything of, but even were it of\r\ntempered cast-steel, the most resistant substance (unless possibly\r\niridio-osmium exceed it) that we know anything about. Lagrange has shown\r\nthat if P be the normal pressure upon any flexible plate curved in both\r\ndirections, the radii of these principal curvatures being r' and r'',\r\nand T the tangential thrust at the point of application and due to the\r\nforce P, then:\r\n\r\n     P = T (1/r' + 1/r'')\r\n\r\nWhen the surface is spherical, or may be viewed as such, r' = r'' and\r\n\r\n     P = 2T/r or, T = P × r/2\r\n\r\nIn the present case P is for a unit square (taken relatively small and\r\nso assumed as plane) of the shell, suppose a square mile, equal to the\r\neffect of gravity upon that unit, r being the earth's radius, and if we\r\nassume the unit square be also a unit in thickness, P is then the weight\r\nof a cubic mile of its material; and if we take (roughly) the earth's\r\nradius as 4,000 miles, the tangential pressure, T, is, on _each face_ of\r\nthe cubic mile, equal to\r\n\r\n     (4000/2) P,\r\n\r\nor equal to the pressure of a column of the same material of 2,000 times\r\nits weight.\r\n\r\nIf the cubic mile that we have thus supposed cut out of the earth's\r\ncrust at the surface were of the hardest known granite or porphyry, it\r\nwould be exposed to a crushing tangential pressure equal to between 400\r\nand 500 times what it could withstand, and so must crush, even though\r\nonly left unsupported by the nucleus beneath, to the extent of 1/400 or\r\n1/500 of its entire weight. And what is true here of a mile taken at the\r\nsurface, is true (neglecting some minute corrections for difference in\r\nthe co-efficient of gravity, etc.) if taken at any other depth within\r\nthe thick crust.[F]\r\n\r\nThe crust of our earth, then, as it now is, must crush, to follow down\r\nafter the shrinking nucleus--if so be that the globe be still cooling,\r\nand constituted as it is; even to the limited extent to which we know\r\nanything of its nature--it must crush unequally, both regarded\r\nsuperficially and as to depth; generally the crushing lines being\r\nconfined to the planes or places of greatest weakness; and the crushing\r\nwill not be absolutely constant and uniform anywhere, or at any time, or\r\nat any of those places of weakness to which it will be principally\r\nconfined, but will be more or less irregular, quasi-periodic, or\r\nparoxysmal: as is, indeed, the way in which all known material\r\nsubstances (more or less rigid) give way to a slow and constantly\r\nincreasing, steady pressure.\r\n\r\nWe have now to ask, _How much_ of this crushing is going on at present\r\nyear by year? And the answer to this depends upon what amount of heat\r\nour world is losing into space year by year.\r\n\r\nGeologists who have taken on trust the statement, that La Place has\r\nproved that the world has lost no sensible amount of heat for the last\r\n10,000 years seem generally to suppose that to be a fact; but in reality\r\nLa Place has _proved_ nothing of the sort, as those geological teachers\r\nwho have echoed the conclusion should have known, had they deciphered\r\nthe mathematical argument upon which it has been supposed to rest.\r\n\r\nBy application of Fourier's theorem (or definition) to the observed rate\r\nof increment of heat in descending from the geothermal _couche_ of\r\ninvariable temperature, and the co-efficients of conductivity of the\r\nrocks of our earth's crust, as given by the long-continued observations\r\nmade beneath the Observatories of Paris and of Edinburgh, it results\r\nthat the annual loss of heat into space of our globe at present is equal\r\nto that which would liquefy into water, at 32° Fahr., about 777 cubic\r\nmiles of ice; and this is the measuring unit for the amount of\r\ncontraction of our globe now going on. The figures are not probably\r\nexact, for the data are not on a basis sufficiently full or exactly\r\nestablished as yet; but they are not very widely wrong, and their\r\nprecise exactness is not material here. Now, how is this annual loss of\r\nheat (great or small, as we may please to view it) from the interior of\r\nour globe disposed of?\r\n\r\nWhat does it _do_ in the interior? We have already seen that it is\r\nprimarily disposed of by conversion into work; into the work of\r\ndiminishing the earth's volume as a whole, and in so doing crushing\r\nportions of the solid surrounding shell.\r\n\r\nBut does the transformation of lost heat into the work of vertical\r\ndescent, and of the crush as it follows down after the shrinking\r\nnucleus, end the cycle? No. A very large portion of the mechanical work\r\nthus produced, and resolved, as we have seen, into tangential crushing\r\npressure, is retransformed into heat again in the very act of crushing\r\nthe solid material of the shell. If we see a cartload of granite\r\npaving-stones shot out in the dark, we see fire and light produced by\r\ntheir collision; if we rub two pieces of quartz together, and crush thus\r\ntheir surfaces against each other, we find we heat the pieces and evolve\r\nlight.\r\n\r\nThe machinery used for crushing by steam-power, hard rocks into road\r\nmetal, gets so hot that the surfaces cannot be touched.\r\n\r\nThese are familiar instances of one result of what is now taking place\r\nby the crushing of the rocky masses of our cooling and descending\r\nearth's crust, every hour beneath our feet, only upon a vastly greater\r\nscale. It is in this local transformation of work into heat that I find\r\nthe true origin of volcanic heat within our globe. But if we are to test\r\nthis, so as in the only way possible to decide is it a true solution of\r\nthis great problem, we must again ask the question, _How much?_ and to\r\nanswer this, we must determine _experimentally_ how much heat can be\r\ndeveloped by the crushing of a given volume, say a cubic mile, of such\r\nrocky materials as we know must constitute the crust of our globe down\r\nto the bottom of the known sedimentary strata, and extending to such\r\ncrystalloid rocks as we may presume underlie these. We must also obtain\r\nat least approximately what are the co-efficients of _total contraction_\r\nbetween fusion and atmospheric temperature of such melted rocks, basic\r\nand acid silicates, as may be deemed representative of that co-efficient\r\nfor the range of volcanic fused products, basalts, trachytes, etc.,\r\nwhich probably sufficiently nearly coincide with that of the whole\r\nnon-metallic mass of our globe.\r\n\r\nThe first I have determined experimentally by two different methods, but\r\nprincipally by the direct one of the _work_ expended in crushing prisms\r\nof sixteen representative classes of rock; the specific gravities and\r\nspecific heats of which I have also determined.\r\n\r\nIf H be the height of a prism of rock crushed to powder by a pressure,\r\nP, applied to two opposite faces, which, when the prism has been\r\nreduced to its volume in powder, has acted through a range of H - t,\r\nthen\r\n\r\n     P × (H - t) / 772\r\n\r\nis the heat corresponding to the work expended in the crushing,\r\nexpressed in British units of heat. The following were the rocks\r\nexperimented upon: Caen stone, Portland (both oolites), magnesian\r\nlimestone, sandstones of various sorts, carboniferous limestones\r\n(marbles), the older slates (Cambrian and Silurian), basalts, various\r\ngranites and porphyries, thus ranging from the newest and least\r\nresistant to the oldest and most resistant rocks. The results have been\r\ntabulated, and are given in detail in my Paper, now in possession of the\r\nRoyal Society. The minimum obtained is 331 and the maximum 7,867 British\r\nunits of heat developed, by transformation of the work of crushing one\r\ncubic foot of rock. If we apply the results to a thickness of solid\r\ncrust of 100 miles (British), of which the upper twenty-one miles\r\nconsist of neozoic, newer palæozoic, older palæozoic and azoic rocks in\r\nnearly equal proportion as to thickness, and the remaining eighty miles\r\nof crystalloid rocks (acid and basic magmas of Durocher) of physical\r\nproperties which we may assume not very different from those of our\r\nknown granites and porphyries--and which, in so far as they may differ,\r\nwould give a still _higher_ co-efficient of work transformed into heat\r\nthan I have attributed to them by ranging them as only equal to the\r\ngranites, etc.--then we obtain a mean co-efficient for the entire\r\nthickness of crust of 100 miles of 6,472 British units of heat,\r\ndevelopable from each cubic foot of its material, if crushed to powder.\r\nIt results from this that each cubic mile of the mean material of such\r\na crust, when crushed to powder, developes sufficient heat to melt 0·876\r\ncubic miles of ice into water at 32°, or to raise 7·600 cubic miles of\r\nwater from 32° to 212° Fahr., or to boil off 1·124 cubic miles of water\r\nat 32° into steam of one atmosphere, or, taking the average melting\r\npoint of rocky mixtures at 2,000° Fahr., to melt nearly three and a-half\r\ncubic miles of such rock, if of the same specific heat.\r\n\r\nOf the heat annually lost by our globe and dissipated into space,\r\nrepresented by 777 cubic miles of ice melted, as before stated, the\r\nchief part is derived from the actual hypogeal source of a hotter though\r\nnot necessarily fused nucleus, and nearly, if not wholly, is quite\r\nindependent of the heat of Vulcanicity, which is developed as a\r\nconsequence of its loss or dissipation. But were we to take the extreme\r\ncase, and suppose it possible that all the heat the globe loses annually\r\nresulted from the transformation of the work of internal crushing of its\r\nshell, we shall find that the total volume of rock needed to be crushed\r\nin order to produce the required amount of lost heat is perfectly\r\ninsignificant as compared with the volume of the globe itself, or that\r\nof its shell. For, as 1·270 cubic miles of crushed rock developes heat\r\nequivalent to that required to melt one cubic mile of ice to water at\r\n32°, and if we assume the volume of our globe's _solid_ crust to equal\r\none-fourth of the total volume of the entire globe, 987 cubic miles of\r\nrock crushed annually would supply the whole of the heat dissipated in\r\nthat time. But that is less than the _one sixty-five millionth_ of the\r\nvolume of the crust only.\r\n\r\nBut a very small portion of the total heat annually lost by our globe\r\nis sufficient to account for the whole of the volcanic energy of every\r\nsort, including thermal waters, manifested annually upon our earth. In\r\nthe absence of complete data, we can only approximately calculate what\r\nis the annual amount of present volcanic energy of our planet. This\r\nenergy shows itself to us in three ways: 1. The heating or fusing of the\r\nejected solid matters at volcanic vents. 2. The evolution of steam and\r\nother heated elastic fluids by which these are carried. 3. The work of\r\nraising through a certain height all the materials ejected. To which we\r\nmust add a large allowance for waste, or thermal mechanical and chemical\r\nenergy ineffectually dissipated in and above the vents. All these are\r\nmeasurable into units of heat.\r\n\r\nI have applied this method of calculation to test the adequacy of the\r\nsource I have assigned for volcanic heat, in two ways, viz.: 1. To the\r\nphenomena presented during the last two thousand years by Vesuvius, the\r\nbest known Volcano in the world; and 2. To the whole of the four hundred\r\nand odd volcanic cones observed so far upon our globe, of which not more\r\nthan one-half have ever been known in activity.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible here to refer to the details of the method or steps of\r\nthese calculations. The result however is, that making large allowances\r\nfor presumably defective data, _less than one-fourth_ of the total\r\ntelluric heat annually dissipated (as already stated in amount) is\r\nsufficient to account for the annual volcanic energy at present expended\r\nby our globe.\r\n\r\nIt is thus represented by the transformation into heat of the work of\r\ncrushing about 247 cubic miles of (mean) rock, a quantity so perfectly\r\ninsignificant, as compared with the volume of the globe itself, as to be\r\nabsolutely inappreciable in any way but by calculation; and as its\r\nmechanical result is only the vertical transposition transitorily of\r\nmaterial within or upon our globe, the proportion of the mass of which\r\nto the whole is equally insignificant, so not likely in any way to\r\nproduce changes recognisable by the astronomer.\r\n\r\nSpace here forbids my entering at all upon that branch of my\r\ninvestigation which is based upon the experimental results, above\r\nmentioned, of the total contraction of fused rocks: for these, the\r\noriginal Paper can, I hope, be hereafter referred to. I am enabled,\r\nhowever, to prove thus how enormously more than needful has been the\r\nstore of energy dissipated since our globe was wholly a melted mass, for\r\nthe production, through the contraction of its volume, of all the\r\nphenomena of elevation and of Vulcanicity which its surface presents.\r\nAnd how very small is the amount of that energy in a unit of time as now\r\noperative, when compared with the same at very remote epochs in our\r\nplanet's history.\r\n\r\nI have said that if we can find a true cause in Nature for the\r\norigination of volcanic _heat_, all the other known phenomena, at and\r\nabout volcanic vents, become simple. Lavas and all other solid ejecta of\r\nVolcanoes, from all parts of the earth's surface, as well as basalts,\r\npresent in chemical and physical constitution close resemblance, and may\r\nbe all referred to the melting of more or less fusible mixtures of\r\nsiliceous crystalloid rocks with aluminous (slates, etc.) and calcareous\r\nrocks. Their general chemical composition, and the higher or lower\r\ntemperatures of fusion resulting therefrom, together with the higher or\r\nlower temperatures to which they have been submitted at the different\r\nvolcanic foci, determine their difference of flow (under like surface\r\nconditions) and of mineral character after ejection and cooling.\r\n\r\nSt. Clair de Ville and Fouqué have shown that the gaseous ejections, of\r\nwhich steam forms probably 99 per cent., are such as arise from water\r\nadmitted to a _pre-existent focus of high temperature_.\r\n\r\nWhether sea or fresh water is not material, when we bear in mind that\r\nthe chemical constituents found in sea water and in natural fresh waters\r\nthat have penetrated the soil are, on the whole, alike in kind and only\r\ndiffer in proportions. But I must pass almost without notice all the\r\nvaried and instructive phenomena which are presented by volcanic vents,\r\nfor to treat of these at all would be to more than double the size of\r\nthis sketch.\r\n\r\nIn the source that has been pointed out as that from which volcanic heat\r\nitself is derived, viz., the secular cooling of our globe, and the\r\neffects of that upon its solid shell, we are enabled to point to that\r\nwhich is the surest test of the truth of any theory--that it not only\r\nenables us to account for all the phenomena, near or remote, but to\r\npredict them. We see here linked together as parts of one grand play of\r\nforces, those of contraction by cooling, producing by _direct_\r\nmechanical action the elevation of mountain chains, and by their\r\n_indirect_ action, by transformation of mechanical work into heat, the\r\nproduction of Volcanoes; and both by direct and by indirect action, of\r\nEarthquakes, never previously shown to have thus the physical connection\r\nof one common cause, but merely supposed, more or less, to be connected\r\nby their distribution upon our earth's surface.\r\n\r\nWe now discern thus the physical cause _why_ Volcanoes are distributed,\r\nviewed largely, linearly, and follow the lines of elevation; we see\r\nequally why their action is uncertain, non-periodic, fluctuating in\r\nintensity, with longer or shorter periods of repose, shifting in\r\nposition, becoming extinct here, appearing in new activity or for the\r\nfirst time there. We have an adequate solution of the before\r\ninexplicable fact of their propinquity, and yet want of connection. We\r\nhave an adequate cause for the fusion of rock at local points without\r\nresorting to the baseless hypothesis of perennial lakes of lava, etc.\r\n\r\nFor the first time, too, we discern a true physical cause for earthquake\r\nmovement, where volcanic energy does not show itself. The crushing of\r\nthe world's solid shell, whether thick or thin, goes on _per saltum_ and\r\nat ever-shifting places, however steadily the tangential pressures\r\nproducing it may act. Hence crushing _alone_ may be shown to develope\r\namply sufficient impulse to produce the most violent Earthquakes,\r\nwhether they be or be not at a given place or time connected with\r\nvolcanic outburst or possible injection, or with tangential pressures,\r\nenough still, in some cases, to produce partial permanent elevation.\r\n\r\nWhen subterraneous crushing takes place, and the circumstances of the\r\nsite do not permit the access of water, there may be Earthquake, but can\r\nbe no Volcano; where water is admitted, there may be both.\r\n\r\nAnd thus we discern why there are comparatively few submarine\r\nVolcanoes, the floor of the ocean being, on the whole,\r\nwater-tight--\"puddled,\" as an engineer would say, by the huge deposit of\r\nincoherent mud, etc., that covers most of it, and probably having a\r\nthicker crust beneath it than beneath the land.\r\n\r\nWe see, moreover, that the geological doctrine of absolute uniformity\r\ncannot be true as to Vulcanicity, any more than it can for any other\r\nenergy in play in our world. Its development was greatest at its\r\nearliest stages, when the great masses of the mountain chains were\r\nelevated. It is even now--though as compared to men's experience, and\r\neven to all historic time, apparently uniform and always the same--a\r\ndecaying energy.\r\n\r\nThe regimen of our planet as part of the Cosmos, which seems to some\r\nabsolute (and presented to Playfair no trace of a beginning nor\r\nindication of an end), is not absolute, and only seems to us to be so\r\nbecause we see so little of it, and of its long perspective in time.\r\nThis the now established doctrine of the conservation of energy renders\r\ncertain.\r\n\r\nWith this source for volcanic heat, too, in our possession, we can look\r\nfrom our own world to others, and predict within certain limits, which\r\nmust widen as our knowledge of the facts of their substance and surface\r\nbecomes greater, what have been and what are the developments of\r\nVulcanicity which have taken place or are occurring in or upon them.\r\nLooking to our own satellite, we see for the first time a sufficient\r\nphysical cause for the enormous display of volcanic energy there which\r\nthe telescope divulges to us; one which is not to be explained alone by\r\nthe commonly made statement of the small density of the moon, but by\r\nthe fact that as the rate of her cooling from a given temperature, as\r\ncompared with that of our earth (apart from questions of the chemical\r\nnature of the two bodies, or of their specific heats, etc.), has been\r\ninversely as their respective masses, and directly as their surfaces, so\r\nhas the rate of cooling of the moon been vastly greater than that of the\r\nearth, and the energy due to contraction by cooling more intense and\r\nrapidly developed in our satellite than upon our globe.\r\n\r\nWe have thus traced, in meagre and broken outline only--because space\r\nadmitted no more--the progress of Science to its existing state as\r\nrespects Vulcanicity, in its two branches of Vulcanology and of\r\nSeismology, and pointed out their more intimate relations and points of\r\nconnection, and been at length able to refer them, on the sure basis of\r\nphysical laws, to one common cause, and that one derived from no\r\nhypothesis, but simply from the postulate of our world as a terr-aqueous\r\nglobe cooling in space.\r\n\r\nWhat I have here advanced with reference to volcanic energy, which\r\nappertains to my own researches, I do not conceal from myself, nor from\r\nthe reader, has yet to await the reception generally and the award of\r\nthe true men of science of the world.\r\n\r\nThat, like every new line of thought which has attempted or succeeded in\r\nsupplanting the old, it will meet with opposition, I make no doubt.\r\n\r\nMy belief, however, is that in the end it will be found to have added a\r\nfragment to the edifice of true knowledge.\r\n\r\nThe interpretation which I have given of the nature and origin of\r\nvolcanic activity points at once to the function in the Cosmos which it\r\nis its destiny to fulfil. It is the instrument provided for the purpose\r\nof continually preserving the earth's solid shell in a state to follow\r\ndown after the descending nucleus. It does this by an apparatus or play\r\nof mechanism whereby the material of the solid shell, locally or along\r\ncertain lines, is not only crushed, but the crushed material is blown\r\nout as dust, or expelled as liquid rock from between the walls of the\r\nshell, which are thus enabled to approach each other; and thus, by\r\nrelief of the tangential thrusts, to permit the shell to descend, which\r\nit is obvious that crushing alone, unless it extended to the whole mass\r\nof the shell, could not accomplish.\r\n\r\nIt is a wonderful example of Nature's mechanism thus to see how simple\r\nare the means by which this end is accomplished. The same inevitable\r\ncrush that dislocates the solid shell along certain lines, produces the\r\nheat necessary to expel to the surface the material crushed.\r\n\r\nWhen attempted to be made the basis for philosophic discovery, \"final\r\ncauses\" are no doubt barren, as Bacon has said; but when we have\r\nindependently and by strict methods arrived at a result, we may justly\r\nappeal, as a test of its truth, to its showing itself as plainly\r\nfulfilling a needful end, and, by a distinctly discernible mechanism,\r\npreserving that harmony and conservation which are the obvious law of\r\nthe universe.\r\n\r\nAs has been said, if I mistake not by Daubeny, John Phillips, by\r\nHerschell, and by myself, the function of the Earthquake and the\r\nVolcano is not destructive but, preservative. But we now see that: that\r\nthe preservative scope of this function, as respects our earth, is far\r\nwider than what has been previously attributed to it. The Volcano does\r\nnot merely throw up new fertile soil, and tend, in some small degree, to\r\nrestore to the dry land the waste for ever going on by rain and sea; it\r\nfulfils a far weightier and more imperative task; it--by a mechanism the\r\npower of which is exactly balanced to the variable calls demanded of it,\r\nand which working almost imperceptibly, although in a manner however\r\nterrible its surface-action may at times appear to us little\r\nmen[G]--prevents at longer intervals such sudden and unlooked-for\r\nparoxysms in the mass of our subsiding earth's shell as would be\r\nattended with wide-spread destruction to all that it inhabit.\r\n\r\nTo the popular mind, Volcanoes and Earthquakes are only isolated items\r\nof curiosity amongst \"the wonders of the world:\" few geologists even\r\nappear to realise how great and important are the relations of\r\nVulcanicity to their science, viewed as a whole. Yet of Vulcanicity it\r\nis not too much to say, that in proportion as its nature and doctrines\r\ncome to be known and understood as parts of the Cosmos, the nearer will\r\nit be seen to lie at the basis of all Physical Geology.\r\n\r\n\r\n[A] For a fuller account of the literature and history of advancement of\r\nhuman knowledge as to Earthquakes, here merely glanced at, I must refer\r\nto my First Report on the Facts of Earthquakes, \"Reports, British\r\nAssociation, 1850,\" and to the works of Daubeny, Lyell, Phillips and\r\nothers, its _complete_ history remaining yet to be written.\r\n\r\n[B] Yet how indistinctly formed were Young's ideas, and indistinct in\r\nthe same direction as those of Humboldt, becomes evident by a single\r\nsentence: \"When the agitation produced by an Earthquake extends further\r\nthan there is any reason to suspect a subterraneous communication, it is\r\nprobably propagated through the earth nearly in the same manner as a\r\nnoise is conveyed through the air.\"--_Lectures, Nat.

The only reference made to my labours, published the\r\npreceding year only, is in the following words: \"Many persons have\r\nregarded these phenomena (viz., Earthquakes) as due in a great measure\r\nto vibrations ... and the subject has lately been brought under our\r\nnotice, in a Memoir by Mr. Mallet, 'On the Dynamics of Earthquakes,' in\r\nwhich he has treated it in a more determinate manner, and in more\r\ndetail, than any preceding writer\" (p. 74). If that Paper of mine be\r\ncollated with this Report, it will be, I believe, found that, as\r\nrespects the earthquake part, the latter tint parades, in a mathematical\r\ndress, some portions of the general theory of earthquake movements,\r\npreviously published by me as above stated. So, also, in the chapter (p.\r\n90) referring to Seismometry, and the important uses to Geology that\r\nmight be (and since have been, to some extent) made of it, no mention is\r\nmade of those instruments previously proposed by me, nor of my\r\nanticipation of their important uses.

I shall now state the reasons upon which my\r\nprediction was founded.\r\n\r\nWhen the central crater begins to heave, with slight eruptions, one may\r\nalways predict a series of slight convulsions of greater or less\r\nduration, which are preparatory to the grand explosion, after which the\r\nVolcano remains for the most part in repose. Thus, when I observed the\r\ncone fissuring in November, 1868, and copious lava streams issuing from\r\nit, and flowing over the beautiful and fertile plains of the Novelle,\r\nthrough the Fossa della Vetrana, instead of announcing the beginning of\r\nan eruption, I announced the termination of one which had been manifest\r\nfor upwards of a year by the constant flow of lava from the summit of\r\nthe cone.\r\n\r\nFrom the month of November, 1868, until the end of December, 1870, the\r\nmountain remained quiet, except that the fumaroles at the head of the\r\nfissure showed a degree of activity by which chlorides and sulphides of\r\ncopper, sulphide of potash and other products, were engendered.\r\n\r\nBut in the beginning of 1871 the seismograph was disturbed,[1] and the\r\ncrater discharged, with a slight detonation, a few incandescent\r\nprojectiles. Then I announced that _a new eruption had commenced, which\r\nmight be of long duration, but with phases that could not possibly be\r\nforeseen_; and on the 13th January, on the northern edge of the upper\r\nplain of the Vesuvian cone, an aperture appeared, from which at first a\r\nlittle lava issued, and then a small cone arose and threw out\r\nincandescent projectiles, with much smoke of a reddish colour, whilst\r\nthe central crater continued to detonate more loudly and frequently. The\r\nlava-flow continued to increase until the beginning of March, without\r\nextending much beyond the base of the cone, although it had great\r\nmobility. In March, this little cone appeared not only to subside, but\r\neven partly to give way, as almost happens with eccentric cones when\r\ntheir activity is at an end. Upon visiting it, I observed that four\r\nprismatic or pillar-like masses remained standing, three of which were\r\nformed of scoriæ which had fallen back again in a pasty condition, and\r\nhad become soldered together, the fourth consisting of a pyramidal block\r\nof compact and lithoidal lava, which appeared to have been forced up by\r\nimpetus from the ground beneath. A little smoke issued from the small\r\ncrater, and a loud hissing from the interior was audible. By lying\r\nalong the edge, I could see a cavity of cylindrical form about ten\r\nmetres in depth, tapestried with stalactitic scoriæ covered with\r\nsublimations of various colours. The bottom of this crater was level,\r\nbut in the centre a small cone of about two metres had formed, pointed\r\nin such a manner that it possessed but a very narrow opening at the\r\napex, from which smoke issued with a hissing sound, and from which were\r\nspurted a few very small incandescent scoriæ. This little cone increased\r\nin size as well as activity until it filled the crater, and rose four or\r\nfive metres above the brim.[A] New and more abundant lavas appeared near\r\nthe base of this cone, and, pouring continually into the Atria del\r\nCavallo, rushed into the Fossa della Vetrana in the direction of the\r\nObservatory and towards the Crocella, where they accumulated to such an\r\nextent as to cover the hill-side for a distance of about 300 metres;\r\nthen turning below the Canteroni, they formed a hillock there without\r\nspreading much farther. These very leucitic lavas are capable of great\r\nextension, the pieces which are ejected forming for the most part very\r\nfine filiform masses, which may be collected on the mountain in great\r\nquantities, and specimens of which I presented to the Academy under the\r\nname of _filiform lapilli_. These threads were often of a clear\r\nyellowish colour, and, when observed under the microscope, were found to\r\nconsist of very minute crystals of leucite embedded in a homogeneous\r\npaste. The crystals were still smaller as the diameter of the threads\r\nwas less, and never formed knots or swellings even in the most hair-like\r\nthreads. These observations led me to reject the opinion of those who\r\nhold that crystals of leucite are pre-existent in the lava. The viscous\r\nnature of these lavas prevented their being covered with fragmentary\r\nscoriæ, but caused the formation at first of a skin, which, thickening,\r\nbecame at last a more or less pliable shell, that, when more solidified,\r\nallowed the still fluid part to run as in a tube formed of this solid\r\nshell. For many months the lava descended thus from the cone and\r\ntraversed the Atria del Cavallo, always covered, appearing below the\r\nCanteroni of a lively fluidity, until it could no longer be enveloped in\r\nits skin, which was stretched by the addition of new lava, and finally\r\nrent asunder to give room to the current until, owing to diminished\r\nliquidity, it was constrained to stop. When the lava, having traversed\r\nthe covered channel it had made for itself from the top of the mountain\r\nto below the Canteroni, made its appearance still running, it frequently\r\nformed large bubbles on the surface, which mostly burst to give vent to\r\nsmoke, and then disappeared.\r\n\r\nIn October, 1871, near the edge of the central crater, another small\r\ncrater was formed by falling in, which, after a few days, gave vent to\r\nsmoke and several jets of lava. The principal cone frequently opened in\r\nsome point of the slope to give egress to small currents of lava, which\r\nquickly ceased. But towards the end of October the detonations\r\nincreased, the smoke from the central crater issued more densely and\r\nmixed with ashes, and the seismograph and accompanying apparatus were\r\ndisturbed: for all these reasons, I said in one of my bulletins, _we\r\nhave either reached a new phase or the end of the eruption_, not knowing\r\nwhether the new phase would be the last. On the 3rd and 4th November\r\ncopious and splendid lava streams coursed down the principal cone on its\r\nwestern side, but were soon exhausted. The cone of 1871 appeared again\r\nat rest, and partly even fell in, but did not cease to emit smoke and to\r\nshow fire in the interior.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of January, 1872, the little cone again became active,\r\nthe crater of the preceding October resumed strength, with frequent\r\nbellowings and projectiles, and soon after lavas of the same kind as\r\nbefore reappeared. The cone of 1871, formed again by the lava ejected,\r\nbecame so full that the lava poured from its summit in the most singular\r\nand enchanting manner. So far only an eccentric or ephemeral cone had\r\nrisen close to the central crater, which, after exhaustion, regained\r\nvigour and discharged lava from the apex instead of the base, as usually\r\nhappens.\r\n\r\nIn the month of February matters were somewhat moderated; but in March,\r\nwith the full moon, the cone opened on the north-west side--the cleavage\r\nbeing manifest by a line of fumaroles--and a lava stream issued from the\r\nlowest part without any noise and with very little smoke, and poured\r\ndown into the Atria del Cavallo as far as the precipices of Monte di\r\nSomma. This lava ceased flowing after a week, but the fumaroles pointed\r\nout the cleft of the cone; and between the small re-made cone, which had\r\nrisen to the height of 35 metres, and the central crater, a new crater\r\nof small dimensions and interrupted activity opened.\r\n\r\nOn the 23rd April (another full moon) the Observatory instruments became\r\nagitated, the activity of the craters increased, and on the evening of\r\nthe 24th splendid lavas descended the cone in various directions,\r\nattracting on the same night the visits of a great many strangers. All\r\nthese lava streams were nearly exhausted on the morning of the 25th;\r\nonly one remained, which issued from the base of the cone, not far from\r\nthe spot whence that of the preceding month had issued. Numbers of\r\nvisitors, attracted by the splendour of the lava streams of the\r\npreceding night, which they supposed still continued, soon arrived, but,\r\nfinding them exhausted, were for the most part conducted by their guides\r\nto see the one still flowing. It was almost inaccessible, and to reach\r\nit one had to walk over the rough inequalities of the scoriæ. It took me\r\ntwo hours to get there from the Observatory, when I visited it that\r\nmorning, and therefore I endeavoured to dissuade those who wished to\r\nvisit it at night from the attempt, but set out myself from the\r\nObservatory at 7 p.m., leaving my only assistant there. The instruments\r\nwere agitated. After midnight the Observatory was closed, and my\r\nassistant retired to rest. Late and unlucky visitors passed unobserved\r\nwith an escort of inexperienced guides; at half-past 3 o'clock in the\r\nmorning of the 26th they were in the Atria del Cavallo, when the\r\nVesuvian cone became rent in a north-westerly direction, the fissure\r\ncommencing at the little cone which disappeared, and extending to the\r\nAtria del Cavallo, whence a copious torrent of lava issued. Two large\r\ncraters formed at the summit of the mountain, discharging numerous\r\nincandescent projectiles with white ashes, and glittering with particles\r\nof mica, which frequently recurred.\r\n\r\nA cloud of smoke enveloped these unfortunates, who were under a hail of\r\nburning projectiles and close to the lava torrent. Some were buried\r\nbeneath it[B] and disappeared for ever; two dead bodies were picked up,\r\nand eleven grievously injured, one of whom died close to the\r\nObservatory. He alone revealed his name, Antonio Giannone. I learned\r\nafterwards that he was a fine young fellow, and Assistant-Professor in\r\none of the Universities.\r\n\r\nAssistant-Professors Signor Franco, who is a priest, and Signor\r\nFrancesco Cozzolino, a priest also, entrusted with the festive mass for\r\nthe Observatory, hastened to assist the dying. On my own return thither,\r\nthe sad spectacle of the dead and dying awaited me; the former were\r\nconveyed, through the assistance of the municipal officer of Resina, to\r\nthe Cemetery, and the latter to the Hospital. But we must leave this\r\nscene of grief and sorrow, and return to the eruption.\r\n\r\nThe fissure of the cone on the north-west side was large and deep, and\r\nextended into the Atria del Cavallo, about 300 metres. No mouth opened\r\nalong the cleft of the cone itself; all the lava issued from that part\r\nwhich extended into the Atria. From previous experience I should have\r\nexpected to have seen the formation of adventitious cones along the\r\nwidest part of the fissure, which is never that most elevated, and these\r\ndischarging from their summits æriform matter frequently mixed with\r\nprojectiles, and from their base lava; but on this occasion no cone\r\nappeared at the widest part of the fissure, but a long hillock was\r\nformed like a little chain of mountains, one point of which was elevated\r\nabout fifty metres above the plain beneath, and bearing no resemblance\r\nto a cone.\r\n\r\nAnother fissure opened in the cone on the south side, which did not\r\nextend to the base, and lava issued from this and flowed in the\r\ndirection of the Camaldoli. Streams of less importance furrowed the cone\r\nin other directions, but the largest quantity of lava proceeded from the\r\nfissure in the Atria del Cavallo, below the hillock or miniature chain\r\nof collines just described. This lava stream was for some time\r\nrestrained within the Atria del Cavallo, among the holes and\r\ninequalities of the lavas of 1871, but these being filled up and\r\novercome, it divided into two branches--the smaller one flowing through\r\na hollow which separated the lavas of 1867 from those of 1871, and made\r\nits way over the lavas of 1858, threatening Resina, but stopped as soon\r\nas it reached the first cultivated ground; the larger branch\r\nprecipitated itself into the Fossa della Vetrana, occupying the whole\r\nwidth, about 800 metres; and traversing the entire length of 1,300\r\nmetres in three hours. It dashed into the Fossa di Faraone; here it\r\nagain divided into two streams, one overlying the lava of 1868, on the\r\nPlain of the Novelle, partially covering the cultivated ground and\r\ncountry-houses; the other flowing on through the Fossa di Faraglione,\r\nover the lava of 1855, reached the villages of Massa and St. Sebastiano,\r\ncovering a portion of the houses, and thence continued its course\r\nthrough the bed of a foss or trench which, contrary to my advice, had\r\nbeen excavated after the eruption of 1855, in the expectation of\r\ndiverting the course of that lava. I did not fail to observe that the\r\nrains which previously descended through these steep channels, would in\r\nfuture be kept back to filtrate through the scoriæ, without ever\r\nreaching the new channel.\r\n\r\nThe lava of this eruption, meeting with this said excavation, flowed\r\ninto it, instead of pursuing its road over the lava of 1855, and thus\r\ninvaded highly cultivated ground and towns of considerable value,\r\nextending to the very walls of a country-house belonging to the\r\ncelebrated painter, Luca Giordano. This lava stream, having surmounted\r\nthe obstacles which the heaps of scoriæ in the Atria del Cavallo\r\npresented to it, ran with great velocity (notwithstanding its being\r\ngreatly widened out in the Fossa del Vetrano), so that between 10 a.m.\r\nand 11 p.m. it traversed about five kilometres of road, occupying a\r\nsurface of five to six square kilometres. If it had not greatly\r\nslackened after midnight, from the failure of supply at its source, in\r\ntwenty-four hours more, by occupying Ponticelli, it would have reached\r\nNaples, and flowed into the sea.\r\n\r\nAlthough I had often visited the two villages of Massa and St.\r\nSebastiano, previously greatly injured by the lava of 1855, yet I could\r\nnot well estimate, upon now seeing them again, the number of houses\r\nwhich had disappeared. Massa seemed to me diminished by about one-third,\r\nand St. Sebastiano by somewhat less than a fourth. But the way of escape\r\nwas open to the inhabitants of Massa; whilst a great river of lava\r\noccupying the road leading to St. Giorgio a Cremano would have hindered\r\nthe flight of the inhabitants of St. Sebastiano, if they had been\r\ndilatory. The lava stream now separating the two villages is little less\r\nthan a kilometre in width, and is about six metres in height.\r\n\r\nOn the night of the 26th April, the Observatory lay between two torrents\r\nof fire, which emitted an insufferable heat. The glass in the\r\nwindow-frames, especially on the Vetrana side, was hot and cracking, and\r\na smell of scorching was perceptible in the rooms. The cone, besides\r\nbeing furrowed by the lava streams just described, was traversed by\r\nseveral others, which appeared and disappeared. It seemed completely\r\nperforated, and the lava oozed as it were through its whole surface. I\r\ncannot better express this phenomenon, than by saying that _Vesuvius\r\nsweated fire_. In the day-time, the cone appeared momentarily covered\r\nwith white steam jets (fumaroles), which looked like flakes of cotton\r\nagainst the dark mountain-side, appearing and disappearing at brief\r\nintervals.\r\n\r\nSimultaneously with the grand fissure of the cone, two large craters\r\nopened at the summit, discharging with a dreadful noise, audible at a\r\ngreat distance, an immense cloud of smoke and ashes with bombs and\r\nflakes, rising to the height of 1300 metres[C] above the brim of lava\r\n(_sull' orlo de essi_). The white ashes, before described, although they\r\ndid not fall beyond the Crocella, were carried by the wind as far as\r\nCosenza, from whence they were sent to me by Dr. Conti. These ejections\r\nwere followed by dark sand, with lapilli and small fragments of scoriæ\r\nof the same colour. The smoke, driven up with violence, assumed the\r\nusual aspect of a pine tree, of so sad a colour that it reminded us of\r\nthe shadowy elm of Virgil's dreams (\"_ulmus opaca ingens_\"). From the\r\ntrunk and branches of the pine-tree cloud fell a rain of incandescent\r\nmaterial, which frequently covered all the cone. The lapilli and the\r\nashes were carried to greater distances.\r\n\r\nThe victims of the morning of the 26th, the torrents of fire which\r\nthreatened Resina, Bosco and Torre Annunziata, and which devastated the\r\nfertile country of the Novelle, of Massa, St. Sebastiano and Cercola,\r\nthe two partially buried villages, the continual and threatening\r\ngrowlings of the craters, caused such terror that numbers fled from\r\ntheir dwellings near the mountain into Naples, and several in Naples\r\nwent to Rome or to other places. Very many delayed from the knowledge\r\nthat I was in the Observatory, and held themselves in readiness for\r\nflight whenever I should abandon it.\r\n\r\nThe rapidity with which the vast torrent of fire assailed the houses\r\n(_i.e._, in these villages), and the great heat which spread to a\r\ndistance, scarcely allowed the fugitives to carry away any of their\r\nbelongings; many were completely destitute. The authorities vied with\r\neach other in zealous efforts to relieve the distress, and the\r\nmunicipality of Naples sheltered and fed the wretched beings for many\r\ndays.\r\n\r\nThe igneous period of the eruption was short, for on the morning of the\r\n27th the lava stream, bearing down upon Resina, having covered a few\r\ncultivated fields, stopped; the lava descending from the summit of the\r\nmountain towards the Camaldoli also stopped; and the great lava torrent,\r\nwhich passed the shoulders of the Observatory through the Fossa della\r\nVetrana, lowered the level of its surface below those of its two sides,\r\nwhich appeared like two parallel ramparts above it.\r\n\r\nIf these streams had continued on the 27th, flowing in the same manner\r\nas they did on the night of the 26th, they would have reached the sea,\r\nbringing destruction to the very walls of Naples.\r\n\r\nBut before leaving the subject of these lavas I must narrate an\r\nimportant fact to which I was witness, and which was thrice repeated,\r\nnear the banks of the great river of fire that ran close to the\r\nObservatory. At three several points, and at different times, I observed\r\ngreat balls of black smoke issue from the lava, driven up with continued\r\nviolence, as if from a crater; through the smoke I frequently observed\r\nnumerous projectiles thrown up into the air, but I could not say whether\r\nwith noise or in silence, for the noise of the central crater was\r\ndeafening. Each of these little eruptions, which I may call _external\r\neruptions_, lasted from fifteen to twenty minutes. The first took place\r\nat the most elevated point of the Fossa della Vetrana, on the right bank\r\nof the torrent; the second, under the hill of Apicella, where the lava\r\ndivided into the two branches, before described; and the third near to\r\nthe Observatory on the left bank of the lava stream. These singular\r\nexplosions terminated without leaving little cones or craters, the lava\r\nin its impetuosity carrying every trace away. These eruptions were seen\r\nfrom Naples, and the Observatory was justly believed to be in danger.\r\nOne has been clearly photographed, the one which was the best seen from\r\nNaples, being the nearest and the least darkened by the smoke of the\r\nlava. (Plate 4.) Is this the first time that the phenomenon has been\r\nremarked? I believe that it is at least the first time it has been\r\nauthenticated. The authority of Julius Schmidt, quoted by Scrope, has no\r\nweight with me, for I was also a witness of what happened at Vesuvius in\r\n1855; and, although these cones were in the midst of the lava in the\r\nAtria del Cavallo, they originated, according to the opinion of\r\neveryone, from the fissure from which the other and much larger cones\r\nproceeded. The same phenomenon was observed in the Atria del Cavallo in\r\n1858, when I caused two of the little cones to be brought to the\r\nObservatory; but these also might belong to the fissure along which the\r\nother cones were arranged. The same may be said of the little craters\r\nobserved, after they had been exhausted, by Professor Scacchi in 1850.\r\nBut the discharging mouths now observed in the Fossa della Vetrana,\r\nwhich existed for twenty minutes and then disappeared, and which were\r\nnot at all in a continuous line, and could not be supposed to correspond\r\nwith any fissure beneath, constitute a circumstance which, if not new,\r\nis evident for the first time, and cause the recognition of a power in\r\nthe lava itself to form eruptive fumaroles.[2]\r\n\r\nThe igneous period of the eruption having terminated on the evening of\r\nthe 27th, the ashes, lapilli, and projectiles became a little more\r\nabundant, whilst the roaring noises of the craters apparently became\r\ngreater. The pine-tree cloud was of a darker colour, and was furrowed by\r\ncontinual lightning, visible by daylight from the Observatory. Many\r\nwriters on the subject of Vesuvius affirm that the flashes which appear\r\nthrough the smoke cloud were lightning unaccompanied with thunder, but\r\nthey studied the phenomena from Naples, or some place more or less\r\ndistant from the crater, where the report of the thunder was inaudible,\r\nor could not be distinguished from the bellowing and detonation of the\r\nmountain. The fact is that these flashes were constantly followed by\r\nthunder, after an interval of about seven seconds.[D] When the flash was\r\nvery short, a simple noise like the report of a gun was heard, but if it\r\nwere long, a protracted sound like that from torn paper ensued.\r\n\r\nOn the 28th the ashes and lapilli, continuing to fall abundantly,\r\ndarkened the air, yet without diminishing the terrible noise; at Resina,\r\nPortici, St. Giorgio a Cremano, Naples, etc., terror was universal.\r\n\r\nOn the 29th, with a strong wind blowing from the east, scoriæ of such a\r\nsize fell at the Observatory, that the glass of the windows unprotected\r\nby external blinds was broken. The noise from the crater continued, but\r\nthe projectiles rose to a less height, indicating a diminution in the\r\ndynamic power of the eruption. Towards midnight the noise of the craters\r\nwas no longer continuous, and recurred with less force and for shorter\r\nintervals. Almost at the same hour a tempest burst over the Campania\r\nwith loud thunder and a little rain. The grass, the seeds, the vine\r\ntendrils, the leaves and tops of the trees dried up immediately, and the\r\ncountry was changed from spring to winter. The storm, although repeated\r\non the following days, passed away by degrees, and thus the floods,\r\nwhich I strongly feared, did not occur. Almost always after great\r\neruptions of Vesuvius, storms of heavy rain have followed, and the\r\nground being covered with ashes, the water could not filtrate through\r\ninto the soil, but descended in muddy torrents over the adjacent\r\ncountry, occasioning as much damage as the fire itself.\r\n\r\nOn the 30th, the detonations were very few, and the smoke issued only at\r\nintervals, and by the 1st May the eruption was completely over.\r\n\r\nWhen the smoke had cleared off the figure of the cone was seen to be\r\nchanged. (_Vide_ Plate 5a.)\r\n\r\nThe ground was perpetually disturbed whilst the Volcano raged, so that\r\nthe Observatory oscillated continually. Some shocks were felt not only\r\nin the adjacent territory, but at a greater distance, at Montovi and\r\nelsewhere. The oscillations at the Observatory were chiefly undulatory,\r\nfrom N.E. to S.W. They were observed for some days after the termination\r\nof the eruption, but not continuously, although they maintained some\r\nintensity.\r\n\r\nIf we refer to January, 1871, we shall find that that eruption was\r\npreceded by several earthquakes, among which were those of the months of\r\nOctober, November and December, in the previous year, that wrought such\r\ndestruction in Calabria, and especially in the province of Cosenza; if\r\nwe consider that as only the last phase, we shall find that it was\r\npreceded by great shocks of earthquake that devastated some regions of\r\nGreece.[3]\r\n\r\nThe great quantity of lapilli which fell buried the scoriæ with which\r\nthe Vesuvius cone was covered, so that it became somewhat more difficult\r\nto ascend to the summit, and much less difficult to descend. Having\r\nreached the top of the mountain, I found a large crater divided into two\r\nparts by what seemed a cyclopean wall. The two abysses had vertical\r\nsides, and revealed the internal structure of the cone. Their vertical\r\ndepth was 250 metres; and beyond that I observed a sort of tunnel\r\nperforated in the rock, with a covering arch raised above the bottom of\r\nthe eastern abyss about 12 metres, judging by the eye. The interior\r\nwalls of the crater showed neither the usual stalactitic scoriæ nor\r\nsublimations, nor fumaroles, but alternate beds of scoriæ and of compact\r\nlava. The fumaroles and sublimations abounded, only about the brims of\r\nthe craters. Hydrochloric and sulphuric acid and sometimes sulphuretted\r\nhydrogen affected respiration, and the temperature rose sometimes to 150\r\ndegrees. Various fissures about the brim of the double crater indicated\r\nprolongations downwards, which allowed me to descend with a rope, in\r\norder to examine the interior of the tunnel to which I have just\r\nalluded. The highest brim of the crater was fissured for a distance of\r\n80 metres, and the greatest depth of fissure was at that place.\r\n\r\nBy measurement with the barometer, we ascertained approximately (for\r\nonly one barometer was used) that the height of the Vesuvian cone was\r\nsomewhat diminished.\r\n\r\nNot only the Vesuvian cone, but the whole adjacent country appeared\r\nwhite for many days, as if covered with snow, when exposed to sunlight.\r\nThis was due to the sea-salt contained in the ashes with which the\r\nsurface was strewn.\r\n\r\nA great quantity of coleoptera assembled on the flat roof of the\r\nObservatory, where the ashes and lapilli were heaped up two decimetres\r\nin height. I found the same species on the cone, where many insects were\r\nobserved on other occasions, such as the _Cuccinella septempunctata_;\r\nthe crysomela populi, etc., were wanting. This phenomenon of the\r\nextraordinary concourse of insects on the top of Vesuvius, in order to\r\ndie in some of the fumaroles, especially noted previous to and after\r\ngreat eruptions, is a circumstance for which I cannot account.[4] The\r\nwhole of the lava emitted in this eruption occupies a surface of about\r\nfive square kilometres; allowing an average thickness of four metres, we\r\nobtain a mass of twenty millions of cubic metres. About three-fifths of\r\nthis lava did no injury, being deposited upon other pre-existing lava.\r\nHowever, the lava in the Novelle, which was deposited upon the lava of\r\n1858, covered quarries of the best stone which had been worked at the\r\ntime, covered many paths that had been cleared, and buried the new\r\nChurch of St. Michele, with some houses that surrounded it, which had\r\nbeen rebuilt on the site of the former church, which was covered by the\r\nlava of 1868. The destruction of land in occupation, of buildings and of\r\ncrops, exceeded three million francs in value. Many proposals for\r\nrelieving the sufferers have been received. Wishing to aid in this\r\nbenevolent work, I gave a public lecture, admission for each person\r\nbeing one franc; and this lecture, from notes badly taken, was printed\r\nby private speculation, and I was compelled to repudiate the report of\r\nit through the public papers.\r\n\r\nThe evolutions of carbonic acid (_mofette_), which usually appear at the\r\nend of great Vesuvian eruptions at low-situated spots or hollows, with\r\nvery rare exceptions, were observed on this occasion a few days after\r\nthe eruption had completely ceased. They appeared in the direction of\r\nResina. I found the most elevated at Tironi, and the most numerous\r\nbetween La Favorita and the Bosco Reale di Portici.\r\n\r\nThe water in wells was on this occasion neither deficient nor scarce\r\nprevious to the eruption, but was very acid after the appearance of the\r\ncarbonic acid evolutions in those neighbourhoods in which they\r\nabounded. Having stated that the disastrous conflagration of the 26th\r\nApril ought, in my opinion, to be regarded as the last phase of a long\r\nperiod of eruption, which commenced at the beginning of 1871, I consider\r\nit right to discuss the question at somewhat greater length.\r\n\r\nNot only from twenty years' personal observations, but from the\r\nattentive study of accounts of previous eruptions, I have found that\r\nwhen the central crater awakens with small eruptions after a certain\r\ntime of previous repose, these almost always have a long duration, and,\r\nafter various phases of increase and decrease, terminate in a great\r\neccentric eruption, that is to say, with the production of an aperture\r\nfrom which a copious lava stream issues. The eruptions of 1858, 1861,\r\n1868 and 1872, furnish the most recent examples of what I affirm. I\r\nmight cite many others of earlier date, but I shall content myself with\r\nrecording the greatest conflagration of this century, that of October,\r\n1822.\r\n\r\nBefore the erection of the Vesuvian Observatory, it was impossible to\r\nobtain a consecutive account of all the phases which the Volcano\r\npresented; but we generally obtained the description of the more\r\nsplendid phases of the eruption which arrested the attention of\r\neveryone. Hence, notices of the small phenomena which preceded a great\r\neruption are frequently wanting. We cannot always ascertain whether the\r\nfumaroles of the craters became active and at what periods, what was\r\ntheir temperature and what the diverse nature of their emanations, etc.:\r\nwhether and when any change in the crater with slight eruptive\r\nmanifestations occurred; discharges which sometimes commenced in the\r\nbottom of a crater becoming active, and so are invisible at Naples.\r\n\r\nBut it may be asked whether the inverse proposition be equally true,\r\nthat is, whether all the great eruptions of our Volcano were preceded by\r\nsmall fiery manifestations of long duration? There have undoubtedly been\r\ngreat eruptions not preceded by small central eruptions, but these also\r\nhad their period of preparation or precursory signs. After the great\r\neruption of 1850, Vesuvius remained in apparent repose until the end of\r\nMay, 1855, when there was an eccentric eruption and a great flow of lava\r\nlasting twenty-seven days. But for a year before the fumaroles on the\r\ntop of the mountain had acquired great activity, their temperature\r\nincreased, and hydrochloric and sulphuric acid became more abundant, and\r\ngenerated the usual coloured products on the adjacent scoriæ. Finally,\r\nin the month of January, a crater was formed by falling in of the\r\nground, and although it did not discharge fire, yet it poured forth\r\ndense smoke. This was the beginning of the fissure manifested four\r\nmonths afterwards.\r\n\r\nIgnazio Sorrentino, who spent a long life in the study of Vesuvius, and\r\nfrequently ascended it, considered the increase of those yellow\r\nproducts--which are chiefly chlorides of iron, but were, at that time,\r\nmistaken for sulphur--as the sign of an approaching eruption.\r\n\r\nThe only grave objection that can be alleged is that of the memorable\r\neruption of 1631, which surprised the neighbouring population so\r\nsuddenly that many perished miserably, surrounded or covered with lava.\r\nBut that terrible conflagration occurred after centuries of repose, so\r\nthat trees had grown in the interior of the crater. No one suspected the\r\npossibility of danger. It took place, too, at the end of autumn, when\r\nthe cone is usually covered with clouds, and, therefore, no one had an\r\nopportunity of observing any precursory phenomena.\r\n\r\nWhen the Observatory was established, I was able--in the first instance,\r\nat my own expense, and afterwards with some slight assistance from\r\nGovernment--to undertake studies more assiduous than any previously\r\nmade. I had two instruments adjusted to indicate the internal efforts of\r\nthe Volcano, viz., M. Lamond's apparatus of variations, which, by means\r\nof finely-balanced needles and methods of amplification proposed by\r\nGauss, indicates the slightest trepidation of the ground, and my own\r\nelectro-magnetic seismograph, a self-registering instrument of exquisite\r\ndelicacy. These instruments, when attentively observed, give the most\r\nvaluable information with respect to the activity of the adjacent\r\nVolcano.\r\n\r\nIf the very slightest eruption occurs, these instruments manifest slight\r\nperturbation, increasing with the activity of the mountain. When the\r\nVolcano attains a certain degree of activity, and the instruments are\r\nproportionately disturbed, it is impossible to foresee a new phase of\r\nincrease without constantly watching the changes in the intensity of the\r\nperturbations; and to effect this it is requisite to have upon the spot\r\na staff of assistants sufficiently numerous, scientific and intelligent.\r\nIf, therefore, on the night preceding the 26th of April the instruments\r\nhad been properly watched, they would have undoubtedly indicated the\r\ngreat increase in the activity of the Volcano. The perturbations on the\r\n23rd were steadily increasing, and on the evening of the 25th they were\r\nmuch stronger than on the 24th, but on the morning of the 26th they had\r\nbecome extraordinarily strong; they must, therefore, have increased\r\nconsiderably during the night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nNATURE OF THE LAVAS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the observer is near the source of the lava, he sees matter in a\r\nstate of fusion, which, like a torrent of liquid fire, runs along, with\r\nmore or less impetuosity, between two banks formed by itself. But as\r\nsoon as the surface of the torrent cools to the point of congelation, it\r\nloses the splendour of its first incandescence. The part which begins to\r\nharden breaks readily in some lavas into fragments which float on the\r\nviscous fluid beneath; these, increasing in number with distance from\r\nthe source, conceal the molten matter beneath and retard its progress,\r\nand at last nothing is seen but the more or less red-hot scoriæ moving\r\nalong. These lavas I shall call \"_Lavas with fragmentary scoriæ_.\"\r\n\r\nOn other occasions, a skin forms on the surface of the lava, which,\r\ngradually thickening, keeps flexible for some time, and then wrinkles or\r\nswells or extends and breaks to give egress to the hot fluid within,\r\nwhich, in its turn, skins over and repeats the same phenomena. This I\r\nshall call \"_Lavas with a united surface_.\"\r\n\r\nThese, in their course, discharge less smoke than the first, draw out\r\nmore easily into threads, and, when cold, have a dark colour, something\r\nlike bitumen or pitch. _The lava with fragmentary scoriæ_, when\r\nstretched, breaks easily, discharges smoke copiously, and, when\r\nhardened, has a more bluish tint, like clods of upturned earth (_formato\r\ndi zolle_). It is noisy in its course, because the incoherent scoriæ\r\nthat it carries along strike and crunch against each other; the other\r\nlava flows silently, except for a sort of crackling arising from the\r\nactual fracturing up of the solid skin by distension from the liquid\r\nmatter within. If required to give the mineralogical characteristics of\r\nthis lava, I would say that it was rich in leucite and contained little\r\nor no pyroxene; the fragmentary lava, on the contrary, is poor in\r\nleucite and rich in pyroxene. The lavas of 1871 were of the \"united\r\nsurface\" character; those of 1872 were \"fragmentary,\" with some\r\ncharacteristics which I shall describe:\r\n\r\n     1. They were of the clearest tint I have ever seen, when\r\n     regarded superficially, but, when broken, the fracture was\r\n     darker than any other lava.\r\n\r\n     2. They had very little leucite and abounded in pyroxene and\r\n     olivine, and sometimes contained a few crystals of amphibole.\r\n\r\n     3. Their specific gravity varied with their porosity; the most\r\n     compact attained 2·75.\r\n\r\n     4. These lavas carried along in their course a quantity of\r\n     scoriæ which had long been subjected to the action of the acids\r\n     of the fumaroles close to the craters, and also a great many\r\n     bombs (_bombe_)--that is, round masses similar to those ejected\r\n     from craters. These varied in size, some having a diameter of\r\n     four to five meters. They frequently contained a large nucleus\r\n     of very leucitic lava, like that of 1871, with a larger or\r\n     smaller quantity of feroligiste (peroxide of iron). Others\r\n     contained lavas changed by the action of the acid vapours near\r\n     the craters. These bombs must have flowed out with the lava,\r\n     for they are found through its whole course, and they were\r\n     certainly not ejected from the crater; for not only are they\r\n     found on the lava exclusively, but masses so enormous were not\r\n     thrown up from the craters during the eruption; those lying on\r\n     the cone near the craters seldom exceed a decimetre in\r\n     diameter.\r\n\r\nAs to the qualitative chemical analysis of the lavas, it always presents\r\nthe same elements, with the exception of small quantities of some\r\nmetals, lead for example, which have escaped the researches of good\r\nchemists, but which I have constantly found in the sublimations of the\r\nfumaroles of the lava. With respect to the quantitative analysis, two\r\nspecimens of the same lava appear indeed to have their constituents in\r\ndifferent proportions. To arrive at any conclusion a long and patient\r\ninvestigation, requiring means and assistance which the Observatory does\r\nnot possess, would be necessary.\r\n\r\nProfessor Fuchs, of Heidelberg, has devoted himself to this work for\r\nyears past, and if he continue it with well-selected and sufficiently\r\nlarge specimens we may hope some day to obtain satisfactory results.\r\n\r\n     5. Every specimen of lava which I examined with a very\r\n     sensitive magnetoscope improved by myself, was invariably\r\n     magneto-polar, not excepting the pieces of the bombs, whether\r\n     rejected from the crater or carried along with the lava.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nFUMAROLES OF THE LAVAS.\r\n\r\n\r\nSmoke generally issues from all lava when it cools down to a certain\r\ndegree, hence it is more abundant at the edges of the fiery torrent, or\r\nis liberated from the scoriæ that form on its surface. But when the lava\r\nstops, the smoke issues only from certain vent-holes, through which we\r\ncan still see the fire, and at the edge of which different amorphous or\r\ncrystallized matters collect by sublimation. These centres of heat, of\r\nmore or less duration, are the fumaroles of the lavas. I believe I have\r\non other occasions shown that a fumarole is nothing but a communication\r\nbetween the more or less cooled and hardened surface of the lava and the\r\ninterior, which is still incandescent. Some fumaroles last but a day,\r\nothers preserve their activity for weeks, months or years, according to\r\nthe depth of lava through which they penetrate; and when they cease to\r\nbe active, that is, when the sublimations are formed, or smoke or other\r\næriform matters issue from them, they still retain a rather elevated\r\ntemperature. In the lavas of 1858, in a place where they had a\r\ntransverse width of 150 metres, a vent-hole may still be found where the\r\nthermometer registers 60° and the scoriæ are warm. Sometimes, while the\r\nlava is in process of cooling, new fumaroles appear, in which the fire\r\nis visible. This phenomenon, which appeared marvellous and inexplicable\r\nwhen I first observed it in 1855, is now very easily understood; the\r\ncooled and hardened crust of the lava fractures with noise and suddenly,\r\nand so a new communication is opened with the incandescent lava below,\r\nthus creating a new fumarole.\r\n\r\nAs the smoke of the fluid lava is perfectly neutral, that is, neither\r\nacid nor alkaline, so the fumaroles at the first period of their\r\nexistence with sublimations of sea-salt, mixed frequently with oxide of\r\ncopper either in black powder or in shining laminæ, ought also to be\r\nneutral. But if the fumarole continues active, hydrochloric acid issues\r\nwith the smoke, and often some time after sulphuric acid. Then the\r\nsublimations turn first yellow, then green, and more rarely azure. The\r\nchemical reactions show that these sublimations are chlorides or\r\nsulpho-chlorides, and sometimes sulphides, and they afford reactions,\r\nindicative of soda, magnesia, copper, lead, and traces of other\r\nsubstances, not excluding ammonia, which I must speak of separately.\r\nThis, I have observed, is the general law with the fumaroles of the\r\ntranquil lavas, which occur with long and moderate eruptions--for\r\ninstance, the lavas of 1871, and even those of 1872, preceding the 26th\r\nApril.\r\n\r\nBut in the great lavas of the great conflagrations of Vesuvius, chloride\r\nof iron more or less in combination with all the other substances above\r\nmentioned changes the appearance of the sublimations. The fumaroles in\r\nthe lava of the 26th April frequently indicated chloride of iron.\r\nSulphuretted hydrogen, by reaction of sulphurous acid, is decomposed,\r\nand sulphur sublimed, having a particular aspect, collects on the\r\nscoriæ. This is never found but in fumaroles of the smaller lavas; it\r\nwas therefore absent in those of 1871, but frequently occurred in those\r\nof 1872.\r\n\r\nAlthough the sublimations are generally mixtures, yet sometimes distinct\r\nand crystallized chemical or mineral species are found, such as sulphur,\r\nsal ammoniac, _tenorite_, _cotunuite_, etc. Micaceous peroxide of iron\r\n(feroligiste), so common near eruptive cones, is very scarce on lava;\r\nany found in it has been carried down from the craters, and proofs of\r\nthis transport are very abundant and striking in the lavas of this last\r\neruption. Even the iron found in the bombs is evidently transported;\r\nthere is a fumarole on the ridge of the lava in the Fossa di Faraone\r\nwhich contains micaceous peroxide of iron, and this, at first sight,\r\nappears to oppose what I have affirmed; nevertheless, it gives\r\nadditional force to my statement. This fumarole is only a bomb or\r\nrounded mass of enormous size, four or five metres in diameter. Smoke\r\nand hydrochloric acid issued from the aperture in its envelope, and\r\nbeing partly broken it was seen to contain lapilli and pieces of\r\nantecedent lava, covered with micaceous peroxide of iron. The internal\r\ntemperature of this mass was very high; the hydrochloric acid which it\r\ndischarged had, in some places, covered the micaceous iron with a yellow\r\ncoating of chloride of iron. From small apertures, on the lower side of\r\nthe mass, white and green stalactites of chloride of calcium were\r\nvisible. In one spot only of lava I found a fumarole, with a small\r\nquantity of micaceous peroxide of iron, evidently in a state of\r\nformation; but this was the very spot where the lava became eruptive,\r\nand whence issued the column of smoke which was so well\r\nphotographed--the place under the hill of Apicella. (See Plate 4a.)\r\n\r\nI have enumerated the products which are constantly collected in\r\nfumaroles, although they are not all found at the same time or place, in\r\norder to show that the sublimations follow a certain law in their\r\nappearance. _Tenorite_, for instance, was formerly considered an\r\naccidental product of certain eruptions, and I have always found it; but\r\nif you visit the fumarole when the acids have had time to transform it,\r\nyou will no longer see it. I found the crystallized chloride of lead, or\r\n\"cotunuite,\" as it is called, for the first time in the lavas of 1855,\r\nand thought it a singular circumstance; but from that time I recognised\r\nit in all the lavas, though not always so beautiful and abundant; and\r\neven when not found as a distinct substance, I observed it in\r\ncombination with chloride of copper. In the lavas of the 26th April\r\n_cotunuite_ and _tenorite_[E] were not very abundant, because the\r\nchloride of iron disturbed the greater number of the sublimations. I\r\nfound sal ammoniac very abundantly on the fumaroles of the lavas that\r\ninvaded the cultivated ground. Although chloride of ammonia, contrary to\r\nopinion, was not wanting in the sublimations of the fumaroles of the\r\nlavas deposited on other lavas, yet it was neither abundant nor\r\ncrystallized, but combined in small quantities with other substances. It\r\nappeared in great abundance in all the fumaroles of lavas which covered\r\ncultivated or woody ground. At first it was scarce enough, and mixed\r\nwith chloride of sodium; but when the rains came the sea-salt was washed\r\naway, and sal ammoniac formed beautiful crystals, nearly free from\r\nadventitious matters, as was the case with the fumaroles of the last\r\nlava. Afterwards, when chloride of iron was produced, ferro-chloride of\r\nammonia was found. Crystals of sal ammoniac were sometimes found of a\r\nbeautiful amber yellow. This colour was, in the opinion of my colleague,\r\nProfessor Scacchi, produced by such small traces of chloride of iron\r\nthat neither Professor Guiscardi nor I, nor indeed any other chemists to\r\nwhom I submitted specimens for examination, could detect any. What I can\r\naffirm with certainty is, that these limpid crystals of a yellow colour\r\nwere almost always attached to an amorphous substance, soluble in water,\r\ncomposed of various chlorides, in which iron was often detected.\r\n\r\nFrom these remarks, it is evident that in the tranquil lavas the\r\nsublimations appear with a certain order of succession, and in the\r\nviolent lavas, and those which flow most copiously, they are more\r\ncomplicated, and render both chemical analysis and spectroscopic\r\nresearches more difficult. Notwithstanding, I observed traces of lithium\r\nand thallium, which I had previously perceived in some sublimations of\r\n1871. I purpose submitting many sublimations which I have collected to\r\nmore complete spectroscopic investigation, although I am persuaded that\r\nthe discovery of traces of certain bodies in the sublimations or in the\r\nlavas is a matter of small importance to the science of volcanoes. I\r\nmust say, however, that calcium was discovered on this occasion in great\r\nabundance, not only by the spectroscope, but also by chemical analysis.\r\nSulphate of lime has often been found in larger or smaller proportions,\r\nbut this was the first time I had observed chloride of calcium both\r\nclose to the craters, and also in the sublimations of the fumaroles upon\r\nthe lavas. The white stalactites which I collected beneath the great\r\nmass or bomb above described were almost exclusively composed of\r\nchloride of calcium, and only a few green drops manifested, with the\r\nusual re-agents, the presence of iron.\r\n\r\nI did not fail to look often at the spectrum of the flowing lavas\r\ncovered with the smoke which issued from them, but I always had a\r\ncontinuous spectrum. The spectroscope employed was Hoffmann's\r\nconstruction, with direct vision; but I think it would be better on\r\nother occasions to use a spectroscope combined with a telescope, like\r\nthose used by astronomers.\r\n\r\nBut avoiding minute particulars of these sublimates, let us see what is\r\nthe general direction and the order of their appearance. Sublimations\r\nare generally oxides, chlorides and sulphates, sometimes sulphides.\r\nAmong the oxides, we must enumerate in the first place \"tenorite\" and\r\n_feroligiste_ or micaceous peroxide of iron. The first is almost always\r\nfound at the commencement of activity in the fumaroles, simultaneously\r\nwith the sublimation of chloride of sodium; the second--which is,\r\nperhaps, never wanting in eruptive cones that are often found lined with\r\nit inside--is seldom generated in the fumaroles of the lava, and\r\ntherefore it is not easy to define the moment of its appearance.\r\nSometimes one collects micaceous peroxide of iron on the lava, but it is\r\noften transported there from the mouths of eruption, as happened on this\r\noccasion.\r\n\r\nTrustworthy writers are of opinion that all the oxides are derived from\r\nthe decomposition of the chlorides, but I think I have clearly\r\ndemonstrated that, with regard to copper and lead, the opposite\r\nstatement may be affirmed; for the oxides are changed into chlorides,\r\nand hydrochloric acid liberated. Oxide of copper forms sublimates at the\r\nbeginning, at the same time as the sea-salt; and if the fumarole be\r\nanhydrous or, as Deville would say, _dry_, this oxide does not change\r\ninto either a chloride or a sulphate; but if the fumarole gives watery\r\nvapour, after a little hydrochloric acid is formed, which changes the\r\noxide into a chloride, and if whilst this is going on oxide of lead be\r\ndeveloped, it is changed into the chloride of lead, so frequently found\r\nin combination with chloride of copper. Then the sublimations change\r\nfrom white to red or yellow, and specimens when carried away gradually\r\nturn light blue, but when heated on platinum over a spirit lamp they\r\nresume their yellow tint. Sometimes the yellow colour remains longer,\r\nand in time changes to green; this also happens on the fumarole itself,\r\nthe green commencing at the zones furthest removed from the centre,\r\nwhere the temperature is highest. When these sublimations are greenish,\r\nthey become far less soluble than at first. The yellow, so common at a\r\ncertain period on the fumaroles of the tranquil lavas, never attracted\r\nattention before I first examined it, doubtless, because it was\r\nconsidered chloride of iron, and yet in small eruptions this is only\r\nfound close to the discharging mouths, and never in the sublimations of\r\nthe fumaroles of the lava; but, on the other hand, it is the most\r\ncopious and common product on the lavas of the great eruptions. This\r\nprobably also accounts for the fact that lead, which is so obvious in\r\nthe fumaroles of the lavas, had never previously been observed. In 1855,\r\nI noticed the crystallized chloride of lead in a fumarole in the Fossa\r\ndella Vetrana, and this induced me always to look for it on the\r\nfumaroles of the later lavas; and I ascertained that, if it did not\r\nalways appear as a distinct mineral, it was easily discovered in\r\ncombination with other chlorides. The specimens which I have collected\r\nare not the most beautiful, but the presence of lead in the sublimations\r\nis not less common.\r\n\r\nMicaceous peroxide of iron, when found on the lava, has been mostly\r\nconveyed from the eruptive mouths, as I have already stated, and perhaps\r\nnever so abundantly and evidently as on this occasion. The lava of the\r\n26th of April carried along a large quantity of round masses or bombs,\r\nvarying in size, among which were found antecedent lava more or less\r\ncovered with micaceous iron, either collected in the cavities of the\r\nlava, or incorporated with its mass. Sometimes the micaceous iron\r\nappears like little veins in the paste of new lava enveloping the\r\nexterior of these rounded masses, an exterior compact and lithoidal, and\r\nnot resembling scoriæ. Among these spherical masses I found one of\r\nenormous size, four to five metres in diameter, which, having broken up\r\nwhere the exterior envelope was thinnest, I found filled with a great\r\nmass of lapilli and fragments of other lavas covered with micaceous\r\niron. This bomb still preserves (June 5th) an elevated temperature\r\nwithin, and emits smoke and hydrochloric acid, which, meeting the\r\nmicaceous iron discovered by breaking the envelope with blows of a\r\nhammer, transforms it superficially into chloride of iron, showing most\r\nclearly how, on some occasions at least, chloride of iron is formed from\r\nthe oxide which precedes it. That those lapilli and the pieces of lava\r\nwere solid when enveloped in the paste of the new lava, we infer from\r\nseeing the impressions on the inside of the said envelope. The chloride\r\nof calcium, which I found in this spherical mass almost pure, caused me\r\nto suspect that the sulphate of lime which is so often found on Vesuvius\r\nis a transformation of the chloride produced by the contact of\r\nsulphurous acid, which easily becomes transformed into sulphuric acid.\r\nThe hydrochloric acid which escapes from a fumarole coming into contact\r\nwith the scoriæ near its mouth, produces chloride of iron, which is,\r\ntherefore, not always obtained by sublimation, although, when the\r\ntemperature is very high, chloride of iron is conveyed from the interior\r\nof the lava, and sublimes on the exterior and colder parts; for\r\ninstance, the chloride of iron which issues from the eruptive cones is\r\nsometimes found sublimed on the rocks of Monte di Somma. When chloride\r\nof iron has been produced by sublimation, we may collect it inside a\r\nglass bell placed over the fumarole, or upon a piece of brick; but when\r\nit is produced by the action of hydrochloric acid on the scoriæ, it will\r\nonly be found on the scoriæ themselves.\r\n\r\nIf, therefore, the origin of micaceous peroxide of iron were due to the\r\ndecomposition of the sesqui-chloride of iron requiring a more elevated\r\ntemperature for its decomposition, it would follow that its genesis\r\nwould be easier near the discharging mouths, and more difficult on the\r\nlavas, but there the fact was verified: for example, in the great bomb\r\non the fumarole, where we observed micaceous iron transformed into\r\nchloride of iron. We may therefore consider it _proved_ that some\r\nchlorides--for instance, chloride of sodium--issue from the lava itself,\r\neither being there pre-existent, or being formed there; and that others\r\nare derived from the oxides which precede them, as undoubtedly is the\r\ncase with chloride of copper; hence, the theory that derives the oxides\r\nalways from the chlorides cannot be considered true. Granting that this\r\ntheory might be applicable to the origin of micaceous iron, we should\r\nstill want to know how it is found with the paste of the new lava\r\nitself, which forms the exterior coating of the bombs above described.\r\n\r\nMany of these rounded masses, which have been rolled along by the lava,\r\ncontain scoriæ partly decomposed by the long action of the acids found\r\non the fumaroles of the craters. They disintegrate easily, and have a\r\nmore or less yellowish tint. In the greater number of cases the interior\r\nof these masses is formed of leucitic lava, with cavities lined with\r\nmicaceous iron. In short, their contents appeared to me quite similar to\r\nthe material of the cone of 1871 and 1872, which in all probability was\r\nengulfed in the large crevasse or fissure that opened below it; and the\r\nfragments having thus fallen down into the lava, were enveloped by it\r\nand carried out by it after having been more or less rounded. The\r\nexternal envelope of these spheres is not at all scoriaceous, but\r\ncompact and lithoidal, and sometimes composed of concentric folds or\r\nplaits.\r\n\r\nAs to the gaseous emanations of fumaroles, watery vapour with few\r\nexceptions comes first; this conveys the material which first appears in\r\nthe sublimations, viz., sea-salt, and for the most part oxide of copper.\r\nIf the fumarole continue active, it passes from the neutral period to\r\nthe acid period, and first hydrochloric acid is produced, which, in\r\nsmall lava streams, never conveys chloride of iron, and rarely attacks\r\nthe scoriæ to form that salt, but expends its force in changing the\r\nsublimations already there. For this reason chloride of iron, though\r\ncompletely absent in the lavas of 1871, was abundantly found in those of\r\nthe 26th April, 1872. Sulphurous acid follows hydrochloric at a later\r\nperiod, and sulphuretted hydrogen occasionally succeeds.\r\n\r\nHaving examined the gases of fumaroles by means of a graduated tube, and\r\nthe pyrogallate of potash, I always found that it contained less oxygen\r\nthan the surrounding atmosphere.\r\n\r\nFor several years I wished to see whether the fumaroles of the lavas had\r\na period of evolution of carbonic acid, as sometimes happens with\r\nfumaroles near the craters, but I have always obtained negative\r\nresults. I often found that the atmosphere on the lavas contained an\r\nexcess of carbonic acid, but as these lavas had burnt many trees, and it\r\nwas probable that carbonic acid springs had formed under the lava, I\r\nnever considered it safe to form any conclusion on the subject.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\nBOMBS, LAPILLI AND ASHES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe bombs ejected from the craters are like those carried down by the\r\nlavas, but of smaller size, and they seldomer contain a nucleus similar\r\nto those found in the latter. With the bombs properly so called, many\r\npieces of incandescent lava were thrown up, and in their fall went\r\nbeyond the base of the cone. A quantity of small scoriæ varying in size\r\naccompanied these projectiles, and those fragments, which we call\r\n_lapilli_, fell at a greater distance. With the lapilli, and sometimes\r\nwithout them, the smoke carried a very minute dust or sand, which is\r\ngenerally called ashes. These ashes, when washed with water, lose\r\nsoluble constituents which they have collected in the smoke--such as\r\nchloride of sodium and other chlorides and often free acids. The\r\ninsoluble part originates in the detritus of lava, and with the\r\nmicroscope we can detect abundant fragments of those crystals which most\r\nfrequently occur in the lava of the same eruption.\r\n\r\nThe lavas of 1871, which were eminently leucitic, and almost entirely\r\ndeprived of pyroxene, resembled the ashes, which appeared to be\r\nfragments of crystals of leucite, more or less enveloped in the paste of\r\nthe lava, so that having triturated the scoriæ of the lava, and looked\r\nat the powder through the microscope, it was apparently quite the same\r\nas the ashes.\r\n\r\nBut at the beginning of the eruption of the 26th April, a white sand\r\nfell in the Atria del Cavallo, close to the Crocella[5], which on the\r\ndark scoriæ of 1871 looked like snow. Its fall had a limit so well\r\ndefined that one passed without any gradation from white to black.\r\nHaving collected some of this sand that very morning, I put it up in\r\nwhite paper, for at that moment it was impossible for me to examine it.\r\nTaking it out some days after, I found it had become reddish, and having\r\nput it under the microscope, I observed that it was exclusively formed\r\nof little pebbles more or less round, of a transparent vitreous matter,\r\npartly covered with a red substance. Fragments of green crystals\r\noccurred in this sand, upon which no red was perceptible. I consulted\r\nour eminent crystallographer, Arcangelo Scacchi, whether these little\r\npebbles were leucite, as I suspected, and whether the green particles\r\nwere pyroxene: he confirmed my suspicion, and remarked that the red\r\ncolour was superficial only. We then washed a little of the sand in hot\r\nwater, and saw the pebbles become whitish; but having heated some on\r\nplatinum, we observed that they first turned black and then became\r\nperfectly white, proving that the red was a deposit of organic matter.\r\nTo see these leucites, rounded like small pebbles transported by a\r\ntorrent, deprived of the soluble chlorides which generally accompany\r\nVesuvian ashes, is a matter worthy of attention. Whilst heating this\r\nsand upon platinum, decrepitation was audible, which indicated the\r\ncracking of some of the little pebbles. It is evident, therefore, that\r\ncrystals of leucite raised to a certain temperature may break, and thus\r\nwe can understand how almost all Vesuvian ashes contain fragments of\r\nthe said crystals enveloped in the paste of the lava. It is evident that\r\nthe soluble part of the ashes is obtained from the smoke through which\r\nit passes. On this occasion the smoke from the craters did not\r\napparently contain much acids, for no bad smell was perceptible, and the\r\nwater in which I washed the ashes scarcely reddened litmus paper. Even\r\nchloride of iron, which was so abundant in the lavas, was scarcely\r\nperceptible in the smoke, which almost exclusively deposited sea-salt on\r\nthe surrounding rocks; I say sea-salt advisedly, and not chloride of\r\nsodium, to show that I include all that sea-salt contains. The slight\r\ndisturbance it manifested with chloride of barium, and the small\r\nprecipitate with oxalate of ammonia, reveal sulphate of lime, without\r\nexcluding the possibility of the chloride.\r\n\r\nBut how can these ashes do so much injury to the vegetation of the\r\nground they cover, especially at the first fall of rain? I think that\r\nthe damage is due partly to the sea-salt, and partly to the acids\r\ncontained either in the ashes or in the rain-water itself. Upon watering\r\nthe tender tops of some plants with a saturated solution of the salt\r\nfrom Vesuvius itself, I noticed that they withered away after a few\r\nhours. But very often the rain alone which traverses the smoke of\r\nVesuvius, or is produced by condensation from it, gives manifest acid\r\nreactions, and destroys the grass and the tops of the trees. The\r\npeasants believe that the rain is warm or of boiling water, from\r\nobserving that the tender parts of the plants are, by its deposit, all\r\nburnt up. Vegetation is now recovering, but without flowers, and\r\nconsequently without fruit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\nTHE CRATERS AND THEIR FUMAROLES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe greater part of the lava issued from the base of the great fissure\r\nin the cone which I have described; and although two other lava streams\r\ndescended from the top of the mountain, neither proceeded from the\r\ncrater, but from apertures near it. The great crater, divided in two as\r\nalready described, opened wide on the morning of the 26th April,\r\ndestroying the brim of the antecedent crater, and remaking it in another\r\nshape with ejected matter, except on the south-west side, where the brim\r\nwas split. (See Plate 5.)\r\n\r\nFrom this double crater, copious smoke, bombs and incandescent scoriæ,\r\nwith ashes and lapilli, issued with violence, and from the depths below\r\ncame dreadful detonations and bellowings, producing great terror. And\r\nyet the lava poured out into the Atria del Cavallo without any noise,\r\nand not even a column of smoke marked its origin of issue--namely, from\r\nthe fissure.\r\n\r\nWhen the eruption was over, the sight of the vertical walls of these\r\ndeep craters, of almost horizontal strata of scoriæ and lithoidal\r\nmasses, with a fracture fresh, and as if they had never undergone the\r\naction of fire or of acid vapours, without recent scoriæ and without\r\nfumaroles, was to me a marvellous spectacle. The fumaroles were almost\r\nall on the brims of the craters, with emanations of hydrochloric and\r\nsulphurous acid. In a few that were more removed from the brim,\r\nsulphuretted hydrogen was perceptible. In the sublimations, chloride of\r\niron was most abundant, in combination with other chlorides, for\r\nexample, of sodium, magnesium and calcium. This last chloride was\r\nfrequent even among the sublimations of the fumaroles of the lavas, and\r\nit was the first time it was ever remarked, but I do not think it was\r\nthe first time that it was ever produced: being in combination with\r\nchloride of iron, and very deliquescent, it did not attract attention\r\nfrom anyone. In a hollow fragment of scoriæ I observed a yellowish\r\nsubstance, which looked like sulphur in a viscid state, and which boiled\r\nat a temperature of 120°, and evolved hydrochloric acid. Having\r\ncollected this substance and poured it into a glass phial, it quickly\r\ncoagulated into an amorphous mass of the same colour; but before I\r\nreached the Observatory, I found that it had become liquid by\r\ndeliquescence. It consisted of a mixture of the aforesaid chlorides,\r\naccording to an analysis made by Professor Silvestro Zinno and myself.\r\nIn some fumaroles, where I perceived the smell of sulphuretted hydrogen,\r\nI found sublimed sulphur under the scoriæ.\r\n\r\nAt the source of the lava stream that flowed towards the Camaldoli, on\r\nthe seaward flank of Vesuvius, I observed large fumaroles of steam only,\r\npure aqueous vapour.\r\n\r\nThere was no trace of carbonic acid in these fumaroles, but that fact\r\ndoes not imply that there was none at a later period, for, since the\r\nfirst investigations of Deville, it is known that carbonic acid is found\r\nunder certain conditions on the very summit of Vesuvius.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.\r\n\r\nTHE ELECTRICITY OF THE SMOKE AND ASHES.\r\n\r\n\r\nOur ancestors could judge that a great amount of electricity was\r\noccasionally evolved in the smoke, from their observation of the\r\nlightning flashes that darted through the Vesuvian pine tree; but they\r\nhad no proper instruments for ascertaining whether this evolution of\r\nelectricity was constant or accidental, or what laws regulated its\r\nmanifestations. My _apparatus, with movable conductor_, by which\r\ncomparative observations of electric meteorology can be made, and the\r\nerrors arising from dispersion corrected, supplied me with an easy\r\nmethod of studying the electricity evolved during eruptions.\r\n\r\nI must begin by describing the bifilar electrometer, in order to explain\r\nthe apparatus which I have named as above, \"_Apparechio a conduttore\r\nmobile_.\"\r\n\r\n_A A_ (Plate VIa, Fig. 1) is a glass cylinder, the lower edge of which\r\nis ground, well varnished with gum lac, and let into a wooden base, B,\r\nfurnished with three levelling screws. Through a sufficiently wide glass\r\ntube, _a a_, runs a copper rod covered with insulating mastic, having a\r\nlittle plate or cylindrical cavity of gilded brass at the top (Figs. 2\r\nand 3), with two arms _d d_, _d' d_. In the plate a disc of aluminium,\r\n_m_, is suspended by means of two silk fibres, and to the disc a very\r\nfine aluminium wire is attached, _f f'_, bent a little at the ends, as\r\nare the arms, _d d_, _d' d_. The disc has about three millimetres less\r\ndiameter than the plate. The diameter of the plate may vary within\r\ncertain limits, but I have found it convenient to make it eighteen\r\nmillimetres. The glass tube, _a a_ (Fig. 1), should descend below the\r\nbase as much as it rises above it, that is three to four centimetres.\r\nThe length of the index is about one decimetre.\r\n\r\nThe upper ends of the two silk fibres, by which the disc and index are\r\nsuspended, are attached to the top of the glass tube, _C_, by a\r\ncontrivance which permits a change in the distance between the two\r\npoints of suspension, and a screw, _p_, is provided to raise and lower\r\nthe disc with the index. At _n_, at the lower part of the tube, _C_,\r\nthere is a kind of torsion micrometer, arranged so as to bring the index\r\nto the zero of the scale engraved on the graduated ring, _B_, which is\r\nformed of a strip of good paper pasted on the rim of a glass disc. The\r\nindex must be placed at the zero of the scale, and must be some distance\r\nfrom the ends of the arms of the plate with which it is parallel. The\r\nplate is about three millimetres deep.\r\n\r\nHaving levelled the instrument, so as to render the disc concentric with\r\nthe plate, and placed the index at zero, it is obvious that if an\r\nelectric charge through the wire, _h_, reach the plate with the arms, it\r\nwill electrify the disc and index: the disc will have the opposite\r\nelectricity, and the extremities of the index will take the same\r\nelectricity as the arms, and consequently the index will describe an arc\r\nmore or less great. The motion of the index is sufficiently slow to\r\nallow the eye conveniently to follow it. Having traversed the first arc,\r\nwhich I call the _impulsive_ one, the index returns, and, after only two\r\noscillations, comes to rest at what I shall call the _definite_ arc.\r\n\r\nWhen the electric charges are of very brief duration, the impulsive arcs\r\nare within certain limits proportional to the tensions, and the ratio\r\nbetween the impulsive and definite arcs is expressed by the following\r\nequation:\r\n\r\n     A (B - A) / B = tang. (1/2) A\r\n\r\nIn which B is the impulsive arc and A the definite arc, showing that A\r\ncomes out nearly equal to 1/2 B. In dry weather all goes perfectly\r\nwithin the limits of proportion, and I can tell whether, during the time\r\nin which the index traversed the impulsive arc, there were any\r\n_dispersions_ and of what nature; for if the definite arc is not close\r\nto the limit of the impulsive arc, it is a sign of _dispersions_ having\r\ntaken place during the motions of the index. Every degree less in the\r\ndefinite arc denotes two degrees of loss for the impulsive arc; but as\r\nthe index employs double the time traversing the definite as it does the\r\nimpulsive arc, we may consider the loss of one equal to the loss of the\r\nother.\r\n\r\nIn excessively damp weather the index gives no definite arc, and it is\r\nnecessary to resort to artificial heat in order to dry the insulators.\r\nThe most simple means I know of is to hold the instrument over some\r\nhollow vessel, which, for the time, is converted into a stove by the\r\nintroduction of a spirit lamp.\r\n\r\nFrom Gauss's formula for the bifilar system of instruments of this\r\nclass, we learn that the maximum sensitiveness of such instruments is\r\ngiven when the length of the suspending fibres is greatest, and the\r\ndistance between them is smallest, with the weight of the movable or\r\nrotating member a minimum; and these elements being the same, the\r\nsensitiveness of the instruments is invariable.\r\n\r\nTo some electrometers, in order to avoid errors of parallax, a small\r\ntelescope, with a micrometer wire, has been added; but, with a little\r\npractice, we can read accurately without this refinement. In order to\r\nobtain comparative measurements, it is necessary to select some given\r\nunit of tension. I have observed that by making a galvanic pile of\r\ncopper, zinc and distilled water, and insulating it well, each pole has\r\na tension which remains the same for many days, if the conditions of\r\ntemperature and the moisture of the surrounding atmosphere are not very\r\ndifferent. With thirty pairs of this pile, each element having\r\ntwenty-five square centimetres of surface, I have on the electrometer a\r\ndefinite arc of 15°, with the temperature of the atmosphere at 20° C.,\r\nand with the difference of 4° to 5° C. between the thermometers of the\r\npsychrometer of August's construction. The first observation was made\r\ntwenty-four hours after mounting the pile. For unit of tension I took\r\nthat which corresponded to a single pair, that is, the thirtieth part of\r\nthe total tension. Other electrometers may be compared with one already\r\nproperly adjusted, without always having recourse to the pile.\r\n\r\nThis done, let us see the arrangement of all the apparatus:\r\n\r\n_H H_ (Plate VIIa, Fig. 1) is the ceiling of a well-situated lofty\r\nroom, with an opening, _o o_, at the upper part.\r\n\r\n_M M_, a bracket or table fastened against the wall, about a metre\r\ndistant from the ceiling, _H H_.\r\n\r\n_N N_, a wooden platform for the observer.\r\n\r\n_A_, the bifilar electrometer.\r\n\r\n_B_, Bohnenberger's electroscope.\r\n\r\n_a a_, a movable conductor formed of a brass rod 15 to 18 millimetres in\r\ndiameter, insulated below by means of a glass rod, well varnished with\r\ngum lac, having a suspending pulley, _c_, and a wooden guide-rod\r\nunderneath it, _l_, within the guiding tube, _k_. At the upper part of\r\nthis conductor, _a a_, there is a sliding roof, _b_, which can be\r\nadjusted so as to prevent rain entering at the opening, _o o_. The\r\nconductor terminates in a disc made of a sheet of thin brass, _d_, 24\r\ncentimetres in diameter. Upon this disc, or even in place of it, we may\r\nuse metallic points.\r\n\r\nAs a support to the conductor at the upper part, I have made use of a\r\ntriangular ring, _x_, drawn at its full size in Fig. 2. The conductor\r\npasses between three springs, and the triangular ring is held in place\r\nby three silk cords, _m m m_. Their material should not be mixed with\r\nany cotton, and it may be advisable to saturate them with an alcoholic\r\nsolution of gum lac.\r\n\r\n_f f f_ is a hempen cord, which is used to raise and lower the\r\nconductor.\r\n\r\n_i_ is a copper wire covered with silk, by means of which the triangular\r\nring, _x_, and through that and its springs the conductor communicates\r\nwith either the electrometer or the electroscope.\r\n\r\nQuickly raising the conductor by pulling the cord, _f_, the index of the\r\nelectrometer will describe a more or less large impulsive arc, and,\r\nafter two oscillations, will stop at the definite arc. Having thus\r\nmeasured the electric tension of the air, and having lowered the\r\nconductor, I next place the wire, _i_, in communication with the\r\nelectroscope, _B_, and by again raising the conductor, I ascertain\r\nwhether the electricity be positive or negative. It is scarcely\r\nnecessary to say that the conductor, when raised, gives electricity of\r\nthe same nature as that prevailing at the moment in the atmosphere; and\r\nwhen lowered, manifests the opposite. In some conjunctures we must keep\r\nthe conductor raised and in communication with the electroscope, in\r\norder to observe certain phenomena which I shall presently describe:\r\nthis method I call observation with a _fixed conductor_.\r\n\r\nI have also constructed a similar but portable apparatus for use on\r\neruptive cones, when required.\r\n\r\nHaving given this description of the apparatus, it remains for me to\r\nrelate the results obtained, especially on the occasion of the last\r\neruption of Vesuvius.\r\n\r\nThe Observatory is distant, in a direct line from the central crater of\r\nVesuvius, 2,380 metres, so that, when the smoke is copious, it is\r\nproperly situated for the study of electricity, particularly when the\r\nwind inclines the pine-tree cloud in the direction of the Observatory,\r\nas frequently happened on the last occasion.\r\n\r\nWith smoke alone, without ashes, we obtained strong tensions of positive\r\nelectricity; with ashes only, which sometimes fell while the smoke\r\nturned in the other direction, we had strong negative electricity; when\r\nthe smoke inclined towards the Observatory, accompanied with ashes and\r\nlapilli, we had sometimes one kind of electricity, and sometimes the\r\nother, just as the smoke or the ashes predominated; and often with a\r\n\"fixed conductor\" we obtained negative electricity, and with a \"movable\r\nconductor\" positive electricity. In Naples, too, at the Meteorological\r\nObservatory attached to the University, my colleague, Professor Eugenio\r\nSemmola, observed negative electricity of strong tension whilst ashes\r\nwere falling there in abundance. The tensions on this occasion were so\r\nstrong as to equal those obtained at changes of weather or during storms\r\n(_temporali_), and, being beyond measure with a delicate electrometer,\r\nwe marked them with the symbol for infinity: the same phenomena were\r\nobserved when lightnings flashed.\r\n\r\nWhen there is but little smoke, it is necessary to approach the eruptive\r\nmouths with a portable apparatus, in order to observe those phenomena\r\nwhich, in great eruptions, may be studied from the Observatory itself.\r\n\r\nThe conditions under which (_folgori_) lightning flashes are seen from\r\nthe cloud of smoke are, that it is conveying great abundance of ashes.\r\nIn 1861, there were small flashes even from the line of eccentric mouths\r\nabove Torre del Greco, although the smoke was not very great; and when\r\nthese ceased to discharge, and the central crater became somewhat\r\nactive, with a moderate amount of smoke but a great deal of ashes, small\r\nand frequent lightning flashes were observed in the twilight darting\r\nthrough the smoke, which was dark in colour. In 1850 the eruption was\r\nmore vigorous, the smoke more abundant, and the ashes scarce, but the\r\nflashes were very rare. In 1855, 1858, and 1868, with a scanty supply of\r\nashes and at intervals, no flashes were observed, and the electricity\r\nremained constantly positive. But having regard to the facts of\r\nantecedent eruptions, one sees that the flashes are always derived, from\r\nthe midst of smoke accompanied with ashes and lapilli, which separate\r\nlike rain from the rolling volumes of smoke, in the midst of which they\r\nwere ejected.\r\n\r\nBut how can we account for the positive electricity of the smoke, and\r\nthe negative electricity of the falling ashes? Without denying the\r\nprobability that a part of the positive electricity depends upon the\r\nelevation of the smoke, as in the case of every other conductor we raise\r\naloft, or with a jet of water sent from a vessel by compressed air, I\r\nthink that the greater part of the electricity proceeds from the rapid\r\ncondensation of vapours, which are changed from the gaseous condition\r\ninto dense clouds; for even when the smoke issues tranquilly and does\r\nnot rise, because carried away horizontally by the wind, it gives signs\r\nof positive electricity. From all my studies of atmospheric electricity,\r\nand from some experiments made specially, it follows that the\r\ncondensation of vapours is the origin of this development of positive\r\nelectricity.\r\n\r\nThe negative electricity of the falling ashes certainly arises from the\r\nfact itself of their fall; for if we place a metallic vessel full of\r\nashes upon an elevated and well-situated terrace, while the atmospheric\r\nelectricity is positive, and cause the ashes from the vessel to fall\r\ngradually into an insulated metallic cup, communicating with\r\nBohnenberger's electroscope placed at three or four metres distance from\r\nthe vessel, the electroscope will manifest negative electricity. If the\r\nupper vessel be insulated, and the ashes permitted to fall upon the\r\nground, we shall obtain, from the vessel, positive electricity. The\r\nintensity of these electric manifestations depends (other things being\r\nequal) upon that predominant at the moment in the air; so that if the\r\nexperiment be made while negative electricity prevails, the falling\r\nashes will manifest positive electricity, the upper vessel then showing\r\nnegative electricity. Now, as the ashes separate from the positively\r\nelectrified smoke in order to approach the ground, which is negatively\r\nelectrified, it follows that they must manifest negative electricity\r\nupon touching the ground, leaving the positive electricity in the smoke\r\nabove. For this reason, the electric tension of the smoke is increased\r\nby the descent of the ashes and lapilli, so that discharges between the\r\nupper and lower part of the pine-tree cloud, or the surface of the\r\ncrater, are rendered possible. Hence it follows that the flashes of\r\nlightning of Vesuvius play through the smoke, and with difficulty strike\r\nbodies upon the earth; and from this circumstance our ancestors believed\r\nthe thunderbolts of Vesuvius to be harmless. However, if the smoke were\r\nvery great, and driven by the force of the wind to some distance from\r\nthe crater, with an abundant fall of ashes, it would be possible to have\r\nlightning flashes proceed from the smoke to the earth. I possess some\r\ndocuments which relate that, in 1631, thunderbolts fell upon the Church\r\nof Santa Maria del Arco, and other places on the coast of Sorrento.\r\n\r\nAfter upwards of twenty years' study and observation of meteoric\r\nelectricity, I am enabled to prove that atmospheric electricity is never\r\nmanifested without rain, hail or snow, and that manifestations of light\r\nare always accompanied by thunder--manifestations of light (_lampi_),\r\nthunder and rain being most closely connected. We may have rain without\r\nmanifestations of light, but never the latter without rain or hail. I\r\ncannot here repeat what I have demonstrated in other memoirs; I can only\r\nsay that the lightnings of Vesuvius, erroneously believed to be not\r\naccompanied by thunder, are really not accompanied by rain, but are\r\ninduced by the descent of ashes and lapilli.[6]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL CONCLUSIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe may conclude from what I have stated:\r\n\r\n1. That by the assiduous study of the central crater, and the\r\nindications afforded by the \"Apparatus of Variations\" and the\r\n\"Electro-Magnetic Seismograph,\" we can obtain precursory signals of\r\neruptions; and that the other premonitory signs pointed out by our\r\nancestors, such as the drying up of wells, either only happen\r\noccasionally or are mere coincidences, such as those of the coincidence\r\nof a dry or a rainy season, the prevalence of certain winds, etc.[F]\r\n\r\n2. That the fumaroles of the lavas are communications between the\r\nexternal surface of the lava, hardened and more or less cooled, and the\r\ninterior lava still pasty, or at least incandescent.\r\n\r\n3. That from the lava, while flowing, there is no escape of acid\r\nvapours, neither from the fumaroles at the first period of their\r\nexistence, but these, if they last long enough, arrive at an acid\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\n4. That hydrochloric is the first acid that appears, combined afterwards\r\nwith sulphurous acid, and, still later, with sulphuretted hydrogen.\r\n\r\n5. That vigorous lava streams may have eruptive fumaroles. (See\r\nTranslator's Note 2 to p. 94.)\r\n\r\n6. That the sublimations follow a certain order in their appearance. In\r\nthe neutral period we get sea-salt mixed with some metallic oxides, the\r\nfirst of which is oxide of copper. But in the great lavas, chloride of\r\niron appears simultaneously with the acid period. Hydrochloric acid\r\ntransforms the oxides into chlorides, which, in their turn, change into\r\nsulphurets or sulphates on the appearance of sulphurous acid.\r\n\r\n7. That the acids, by attacking the scoriæ, create new chlorides and\r\nsulphates, which are thus not products merely of sublimation.\r\n\r\n8. That micaceous peroxide of iron--so common and abundant near the\r\neruptive mouths--is very scarce and rare on the lavas, unless conveyed\r\nthere from the craters.\r\n\r\n9. That chloride of iron--so manifest on the fumaroles of the great\r\nlavas--is only found in small eruptions close to the discharging mouths.\r\n\r\n10. That the frequency of chloride of iron in the lavas of great\r\neruptions masks the order of transformation of the other products.\r\n\r\n11. The fumaroles at the summit of Vesuvius present even greater\r\ngradations, for they often emit carbonic acid or pure watery vapour.\r\n\r\n12. Lead, which I first discovered in the fumaroles of the lavas of\r\n1855, is a constant product of fumaroles which have a certain duration.\r\nIt is often obtained as a distinct and crystallized chloride, and often\r\nis found in combination with other products.\r\n\r\n13. Oxide of copper is also a constant and primary (_primitivo_) product\r\nof fumaroles. The chloride and sulphate of copper are formed from the\r\noxide, directly contrary to general belief.\r\n\r\n14. I do not think that the chloride of calcium, which I found on this\r\noccasion in almost all the deliquescent sublimations, is a product\r\npeculiar to this eruption only, in which alone, however, I found it. I\r\nwas, therefore, induced to look for it in other sublimates, in which I\r\nmight possibly have overlooked it, as, without doubt, my predecessors\r\nhave done, owing to the deliquescence of the chloride of iron with which\r\nit was constantly combined. I think that this chloride, in accordance\r\nwith the general law, is transformed into a sulphate--a transformation\r\nwhich readily occurs on Vesuvius.\r\n\r\n15. Copious and well-crystallized sal ammoniac is only found on the\r\nfumaroles of those lavas which have covered cultivated or wooded ground.\r\n\r\n16. The scarcity of oxygen in the gases of fumaroles may possibly arise\r\nfrom the formation of the oxides which precede the chlorides.\r\n\r\n17. Lavas give a continuous spectrum, although covered with smoke, when\r\nlooked at with Hoffmann's spectroscope with direct vision.[G]\r\n\r\n18. The smoke gives positive electricity, and the falling ashes negative\r\nelectricity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREFERENCE TO THE PLATES.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLATE\r\n\r\nIa.

Professor Palmieri has not given any description\r\nin this Memoir of his seismograph--the instruments described being those\r\nonly which have relation to atmospheric electricity. The following brief\r\naccount of his seismograph will, therefore, form a not unsuitable\r\ncomplement to his Memoir. The instrument, in general terms, is of that\r\nclass in which the wave movements are indicated by the displacement,\r\nrelative or absolute, of columns of mercury in glass tubes. It is a\r\nself-recording instrument, composed of two distinct portions--one for\r\nrecord of horizontal, or rather of what are called undulatory shocks;\r\nthe other for vertical shocks. In point of general principle, therefore,\r\nit is very similar to that proposed by me (\"Transactions, Royal Irish\r\nAcademy,\" in 1846), and in certain respects appears to me less\r\nadvantageous than the latter. Some account of the Palmieri instrument,\r\ntogether with some critical remarks as to its action, may be found in my\r\n\"Fourth Report on Earthquakes\" (\"Reports, British Association, 1858,\"\r\npp. 75-81). The following description of the instrument is derived from\r\n\"The Engineer,\" of 7th June, 1872, and the publishers have to thank the\r\nproprietors of that journal for permission to use the illustration,\r\nPlate 8.\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 1, _E_ is a helix of brass wire (gauge about one millimetre);\r\nthe helix consists of fourteen or fifteen turns, and has a diameter of\r\nfrom twenty to twenty-five millimetres; it hangs from a fine metal\r\nspring, and can be raised or lowered by a thumb screw. From the lower\r\nend of the helix hangs a copper cone with a platinum point; the latter\r\nis kept close to the surface of mercury in the iron basin, _f_, which\r\nrests on an insulating column of wood or marble, _G_. The distance of\r\nthe point from the surface of the mercury remains constant, as the metal\r\npillar, _T_, is of such a length that its expansion or contraction by\r\nchange of temperature compensates that of the helix; the latter is in\r\nconnection (by _T_) with one pole of a Daniell's battery of two cells,\r\nand the basin, _f_, is connected with the other pole. Any vertical\r\nmovement, however slight, makes the platinum point dip into the mercury,\r\nand thus completes the circuit. In this circuit are included two\r\nelectro-magnets, _C_ and _D_; these, during the circulation of a\r\ncurrent, attract their armatures, which are connected with levers. The\r\naction of _C's_ lever is to stop the clock, _A_, which thus records, to\r\na half-second, the time of the occurrence of the shock, at the same\r\ninstant that the clock strikes an alarm bell, which attracts the\r\nattention of an observer. The lever, attached to the armature of _D_, at\r\nthe first instant of the current frees the pendulum of the clock, _B_,\r\nwhich was before kept from swinging, in a position out of the vertical;\r\nthe clock then acts as a time-piece, and its motion unrolls a band of\r\npaper, _k k k_, at a rate of three metres an hour. At the same time the\r\narmature of _D_, while attracted, presses a pencil point against the\r\nband of paper which passes over the roller, _m_, marking on it, while\r\nthe earthquake lasts, a series of points or strokes which occupy a\r\nlength of paper corresponding to its duration, and which record the work\r\nof the shock. After it is over the paper continues to unroll from the\r\ndrum, _i_, and passing round the clock, rolls on to the drum, _l_. If a\r\nfresh shock occur the pencil indicates it, as before, on the paper, and\r\nthe length of blank paper between the two sets of marks is a measure of\r\nthe interval of time between the shocks. By way of additional check,\r\nseveral helices, _h h h_, are hung from a stand, with small permanent\r\nmagnets suspended from their ends; below and close to these latter are\r\nsmall basins, holding iron filings; into these the points of the magnets\r\ndip, when their helices oscillate vertically, and some filings remain\r\nsticking to the magnets as a record of the shock. One of the magnets has\r\na shoulder on it which moves an index hand along a graduated arc, as\r\nshown in Fig. 2, thus again registering the amount of the vertical\r\nmovement. Such are the arrangements intended for the record of the\r\nundulatory or horizontal elements of the wave of shock.\r\n\r\nThe following are the arrangements proposed for recording the horizontal\r\nmotions: On the stand, to the right of the clock, _A_, are set four\r\nU-shaped glass tubes, open at their ends. One of each pair of vertical\r\nbranches must have a diameter at least double that of the other. These\r\npairs, with their supporting columns, are shown in plan, where one pair\r\nlies N. and S., another E. and W., a third N.E. and S.W., and the other\r\nN.W. and S.E. It will be observed that metallic bars pass from the\r\npillar, _P_, over the ends of all the long branches, and similar bars\r\npass from _R_, over the ends of the short branches; the pillars\r\nthemselves, as in the case of the other instruments, are each connected\r\nwith one pole of a Daniell's battery, the connections including the\r\nelectro-magnets, _C_ and _D_. The description of one U tube, _n_, will\r\napply to all the others; _n_ is partly filled with mercury, and an iron\r\nor platinum wire, _o_, suspended from the bar above the short branch,\r\ndips into the mercury therein, while another platinum wire hung from the\r\nbar over the mouth of the longer branch, has its end very close to the\r\nsurface of the mercury in that branch. Any shock which is not\r\nperpendicular in direction to the plane of the branches of the U will\r\ncause the mercury to oscillate in the tubes, and more sensibly in that\r\nwith the smaller diameter; when it rises up in the latter, so as to\r\ntouch the platinum point, the connection between _P_ and _R_ is made and\r\nthe circuit completed, starting the action of the electro-magnets _C_\r\nand _D_, which record the shock, as already described. By having the\r\nplanes of the tubes set in the different azimuths, already mentioned,\r\none or more of the pairs is sure to be acted upon, and by observing in\r\nwhich the oscillation takes place the direction of the shock is supposed\r\nto be ascertained. Besides this, each long branch of the U, viz., that\r\nof smaller diameter, has a small ivory pulley, _q_, fixed above it, over\r\nwhich passes a single fibre of silk, with an iron float at one end,\r\nresting on the surface of the mercury; at the other end of the fibre\r\nhangs a counterpoise; fixed to the pulley is a fine index hand, capable\r\nof moving along a graduated arc. When the shock takes place the mercury,\r\nrising in the long branch, raises the float on its surface, the silk\r\nfibre at the same time makes the pulley revolve with its index hand,\r\nwhich afterwards remains stationary, as the counterpoise prevents the\r\nfloat from sinking again with the mercury. The reading on the graduated\r\narc is thus a measure of the movements produced in the instrument by the\r\nhorizontal element of the shock, and is supposed to measure that shock.\r\nIt is assumed that in all these instruments shocks, however small, can\r\nbe recorded with certainty by adjusting the distance between the\r\nplatinum points and the mercury.\r\n\r\nThe arrangement of Daniell's battery used for the seismograph is shown\r\nin Fig. 4, where, for convenience of cleaning, the copper element is\r\nmade of wire (about No. 8 Birmingham wire gauge) coiled flat without the\r\nspirals touching. Crystals of sulphate of copper are placed at the\r\nbottom of the outer cell, into which water is poured; and the inner\r\ncell, into which the zinc plate goes, is filled with siliceous sand.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the above some instruments of a rougher description are\r\nemployed as checks. Thus, at the foot of the pillar, _G_, there is a\r\nwooden trough with eight holes, facing as many equidistant points of the\r\ncompass (two of them shown in section) round its inner circumference;\r\nmercury is poured into the basin until its level is nearly up to the\r\nlips of the holes. The effect of a shock is to throw some of the mercury\r\ninto one or more of these holes, and the greater the oscillation the\r\nmore mercury is thrown into the cells through the holes. The screws\r\nshown outside are for drawing off the mercury from the cells, when its\r\nquantity can be measured. The direction of the shock is shown by seeing\r\nwhich cells are filled with mercury. This is the old Cacciatore\r\nseismometer which has been long employed in Italy. (See 4 \"Report of\r\nBritish Association, 1858,\" p. 73), and Daubeny's \"Volcanoes,\" Appendix.\r\nThe following is another contrivance. From the arm of the pillar, _G_, a\r\nfine metal wire hangs, with a metal ball at its end, which, by its\r\noscillation, thrusts out one or more light glass tubes, set horizontally\r\nin a stand, as shown in Fig. 3. The two rings are of wood, and the glass\r\ntubes pass through holes in them; small leather washers are placed\r\noutside the outer rings; the displacement of one or more tubes is\r\nassumed to measure the horizontal element of the shock. By means of this\r\napparatus the time of the first shock is recorded, as well as the\r\ninterval between the shocks, and the duration of each; their direction,\r\nwhether vertical or horizontal, is given, as also the maximum of\r\nintensity. Professor Palmieri has the instruments examined three times a\r\nday, and an assistant-observer is always at hand to attend to the bell,\r\nand put back the apparatus to its normal position for fresh observation.\r\n\r\nIt has been stated that this instrument is sensible to most of the\r\nshocks which occur in the Mediterranean basin.\r\n\r\nIt is not my intention here to offer any criticism as to the\r\nconstruction or performances of this instrument, the rather as I must\r\nconfess I do not quite share the high opinion of its inventor as to the\r\ncertainty or exactitude of its indications.\r\n\r\nThere can be no question as to the extreme importance to science of the\r\nestablishment and continued use of a seismographic instrument of\r\nunexceptionable construction at the Observatory upon Vesuvius; and it\r\nwould be a valuable gift to science, were the Italian Government to\r\nenable Signor Palmieri to establish such an one. Its great value and the\r\nvery first problem to set the instrument to solve should be, by _a rigid\r\ndetermination of the direction of propagation of the wave of shock_, of\r\nthose slight or stronger pulsations which precede or accompany the\r\nVesuvian like all other eruptions, on arriving at the Observatory, _to\r\nfix the depth, and the position vertically beneath the cone, whence\r\nthese pulses are derived_. This would be, in fact, to fix the depth and\r\nposition beneath the mountain at which the volcanic focus is situated\r\nfor the time, or, at least, where the volcanic activity is at the time\r\ngreatest. And the assured knowledge, even within moderate limits of\r\naccuracy, of this depth, and even for this single mountain, would be an\r\nimmense accession to our positive knowledge, and a really new stage\r\ngained for future advances. At present, we know but little as to the\r\nactual depth below our globe's surface at which volcanic activity\r\noccurs, or to which it is limited, either upwards or downwards. I have,\r\nmyself, established some data upon the flanks of Etna, not yet\r\npublished, which may enable me to afford some information on the subject\r\nhereafter. Meanwhile, Professor Palmieri possesses unrivalled\r\nopportunities for such observations; and I trust health, life and means\r\nmay be afforded him, to become the first who shall have made this great\r\naddition to our positive knowledge of Vulcanology.\r\n\r\nSo far, popularly at least, the alleged chief uses and value of these\r\nseismographic instruments, at the Observatory of Vesuvius, have been\r\nmade to depend upon their being presumed to afford means for foretelling\r\neruptions, or affording precursory warnings of their probable progress\r\nand destructive course.\r\n\r\nI feel compelled to express my own total disbelief in the possibility of\r\nany such predictions in the present state of science, by the help of any\r\ninstruments whatsoever, of such a nature as to be of any _practical\r\nvalue_, or any certainty beyond that which a certain amount of _mere\r\nexperience_ as to the _rôle commonly played_ by Vesuvius or other\r\nVolcanoes in pretty habitual activity affords to the observer for a\r\nlengthened period. And even this affords scarcely any guide as to what\r\nmay happen next. Monte Nuovo was thrown up in a night; Vesuvius _might_\r\ndouble its volume in a night, or might sink into a hollow like that of\r\nthe Val del Bove in a not much longer time. A small _fusillade_ may go\r\non for months, and yet, without an hour's notice, by any premonitory\r\nsign, may waken up to a roar and darken the air with ashes and lapilli\r\nsuch as those which overwhelmed Pompeii. One eruption may blow forth\r\nlittle but dust and ashes (so called), another may pour out rivers of\r\nlava and little else.\r\n\r\nThe _main_ mischief of all eruptions is effected in two ways: by the\r\ndeposit of dust and ashes, lapilli, etc., to the injury or destruction\r\nof fertile land, and by the streams of lava which overwhelm it, as well\r\nas buildings, etc. But what information of any value can seismographic\r\nobservation afford as to the course that either of these may take in any\r\neruption? The volume of pulverulent material that may be ejected cannot\r\nbe foreseen; its distribution depends mainly upon its nature and upon\r\nthe direction and force of the wind at the time; or again, how shall\r\nthese warn us as to the course that the lava, if it appear, shall take,\r\nwhen we cannot possibly foretell when, how, or by what mouth it may\r\nissue. Even in this late eruption of 1872, with Palmieri stoutly at his\r\npost upon the mountain, and the Observatory instruments in full\r\nactivity, they gave no forewarning of the sudden and unexpected belch\r\nforth from the base of the cone, of that tremendous gush of liquid lava\r\nwhich in a few minutes cut off from life the unhappy visitors whose\r\ndeaths he has recorded.\r\n\r\n[2] (P. 94). It can scarcely be supposed that these small\r\neruptive-looking belchings forth from the lava stream, _en route_, are\r\ntruly of an eruptive nature at all, _i.e._, in any way connected with\r\nforces seated deeply beneath the bed of the lava stream, or in any way\r\nconnected with the volcanic ducts of the cone or beneath it. They are\r\nmost probably merely the bursting upwards of large bubbles; that is, of\r\ncavities formed in the mass of the more or less liquid lava by intestine\r\nmovements, as its mass winds and rolls along, and by the aggregation of\r\nsmaller cavities--all being filled with steam and gases--together with\r\ndust and volatile products which are ejected when the cavity opens up,\r\nand its contents escape at the upper surface of the lava stream in\r\nvirtue of the continuation of the twistings and convolutions due to the\r\nstream motion itself, and to the unbalanced hydrostatic pressures acting\r\nupon the parietes of the bubble. Very large single bubbles of like\r\ncharacter rise in the fluid lava within craters in vigorous action, and\r\noften so regularly that their recurrence causes a sort of rhythmical\r\nrush and roar in the column of steam, etc., issuing above the mouth.\r\nThis was evident in the discharges issuing in 1857 from the highly\r\ninstructive minor _bocca_, then existing, examined by me, and referred\r\nto (\"Report, Naples, Earthquakes,\" etc. Vol. II., pp. 313, 314), as\r\npresenting at the time great facilities for determining pyrometrically\r\nthe temperature of the lava within, and of the dry superheated steam\r\nissuing with a rhythmic roar from it. M. Le Coq (\"Époques Géologiques\r\nd'Auvergne,\" Tome IV.) has recorded some examples of the formation and\r\nopening-out of large bubble-like cavities in lava already ejected.\r\nPerhaps that able and laborious vulcanologist, whose death a few months\r\nago science still deplores, attributes too much importance as well as\r\nmagnitude to them, when attributing the formation of what he has\r\ndenominated \"craters of explosion,\" to the mechanism of the rise and\r\nbursting of such bubbles upon a gigantic scale. Such blowings forth,\r\nsudden or prolonged, from particular spots of lava streams, _en route_,\r\nundoubtedly may also have their origin in damp places, or water or\r\nair-filled cavities in or beneath the bed over which the lava rolls,\r\nwhich, getting gradually heated, generate steam, or air or gases under\r\ntension by expansion, etc., which thus at length blow through the liquid\r\nor pasty lava flowing above, and which in bursting through delivers much\r\ndust also, and so simulates a little eruptive crater. Examples of this,\r\nupon a great and convincing scale, can be pointed to in the Val di\r\nCalanna and elsewhere on Etna.\r\n\r\n[3] (P. 96). There are strong grounds for the gravest doubts that there\r\nexists any real connection of a physical character between Volcanic\r\nEruptions, and Earthquakes more or less _approximately_ coincident only,\r\nin time of occurrence; the respective sites being widely apart, and the\r\nless the probability as the intervening distance is greater. The\r\ndiscussions of the large number of records that are to be found of such\r\ncoincidences--mostly but partial, and in but _very_ few instances\r\ncomplete coincidences--by Perrey, von Hoff, and others, as well as by\r\nmyself, do not tend to sustain the view that such imperfect\r\ncontemporaneity is based upon any causative connection. The seismic\r\nregion of Greece appears to have no _direct_ connection with that of\r\nSouthern Italy: the band of connection, if any, seems to lie between\r\nNorthern Italy, across the Northern Adriatic, by Ragusa, and thence\r\nspreading into Asia Minor.\r\n\r\n[4] (P. 97). The abundance of coleoptera and of various other forms of\r\ninsect life about lava beds, both recent and old, is a very singular\r\nfact, and one worthy of the careful observation of entomologists. In the\r\nautumn of 1864, at mid-day, when sitting sketching upon the lava about\r\nthe middle of the Val del Bove (Etna), I found it almost impossible to\r\nwork, or even to remain for an instant still, in consequence of the\r\ncontinual cloud of insects, large and small, that struck against me in\r\nflight, endangered the eyes, and swarmed upon my clothes. It is quite\r\npossible that this local superabundance of insect life may arise merely\r\nfrom the general dryness and warmth of such places, and the plentiful\r\n_nidus_ that the innumerable cavities in lava afford for the eggs and\r\nearlier stages of insect life; still, this apparition of one form of\r\nlife may also be connected with other circumstances not unimportant to\r\ndiscover.\r\n\r\n[5] (P. 120). The _Crocella_ is a small wooden cross, erected several\r\nyears ago, and which one passes to the right hand at the upper end of\r\nthe path along the ridge of tufa and volcanic conglomerate upon which\r\nthe Observatory stands, in ascending thence to the Atria del Cavallo.\r\n\r\n[6] (P. 134). That the causes assigned by Professor Palmieri for the\r\npotent developments of electricity (positive or negative) which\r\ncharacterise the ascent of the issuing columns of (chiefly if not\r\nalways) _dry_ steam, with a relatively small volume of various gases,\r\nand throwing up, in their blast, volumes of small solid particles in\r\nashes and lapilli, etc., and the subsequent fall as a mineral or stony\r\nhail-shower of the latter, through the partially condensing vapours and\r\nthe circumambient air, are the main causes of electrical development\r\nevidencing itself in lightning flashes, is no doubt true. We must not,\r\nhowever, lose sight of the many other and very effective agencies at\r\nwork here to produce electric excitement. The actual _bocca_ of the\r\nvolcanic vent whence the steam roars off constitute the cone a veritable\r\nhydro-electric machine. Mechanical energy in various forms is\r\ntransformed into electric energy. Chemical action is going on both in\r\nthe solid and in the vapourous and gaseous emanations as they rush into\r\nand remain in the air or descend from it, and chemical action is\r\ntransformed in part into electric energy. Percussion between ascending\r\nand descending particles and fragments, fractures and breaking up of\r\nmore or less of these, thus and by sudden changes of temperature in\r\ncooling, are likewise operative. In addition, great and violent\r\nmovements in the atmosphere itself result from the large local\r\naccessions of temperature by the heated volume driven up into it, and\r\nwhich in turn give rise to electric disturbance of the same character as\r\nthose produced in wind storms and whirlwinds, brought about by the\r\nnatural causes which every day effect disturbances in our atmosphere all\r\nover the globe.\r\n\r\n[7] (P. 135). The views stated in note 3 (to page 96) may here again be\r\nreferred to as in point. How is it possible, in the present state of\r\nscience at least, to establish any physical connection between an\r\neruption in Java and one of Vesuvius, \"with half the world between,\"\r\nwhen not even having the solitary connecting link of complete\r\ncontemporaneity, and which, if it existed, yet might be nothing but\r\naccidental? A list of shocks upon record, which have occurred more or\r\nless nearly simultaneously at distant parts of the world, may be found\r\nin my fourth Report, (\"Facts of Earthquakes,\" \"British Association\r\nReports, 1858\") and the reasons are there given for rejecting the notion\r\nof any direct physical connection between the origins of the respective\r\nshocks.\r\n\r\nShocks, emanating from the close neighbourhood of volcanic vents, or\r\nsimultaneity of eruption, in vents not far distant from each other,\r\nstand upon a different footing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber's Notes.\r\n\r\nPreserved the unusual, but consistent, spelling of \"develope.\"\r\n\r\nPreserved the unusual, and inconsistent, references to the Plates.\r\nSometimes Arabic numerals are used, but usually Roman numerals. Most\r\nhave \"A\" attached to the name (which was changed to \"a\" to avoid\r\nconfusion in the Roman numerals), but not VIII, and sometimes not in the\r\nreferences to them.\r\n\r\nEquations were converted to linear text, adding spacing and parentheses\r\nas necessary. Greek characters were also replaced by Latin letters in\r\nthe Latin-1 version.\r\n\r\nReplaced the oe ligature with the two characters in \"Goethe\" in the\r\nfront material.\r\n\r\nChanged \"fumarolles\" to \"fumaroles\" on page 3: \"fumaroles and\r\nsalfatares.\"\r\n\r\nChanged \"Lyall\" to \"Lyell\" in footnote originally on page 9: \"Daubeny,\r\nLyell, Phillips and others.\"\r\n\r\nChanged \"throught\" to \"through\" on page 35: \"passing through it.\"\r\n\r\nRemoved duplicated word \"the\" on page 40: \"the great Calabrian\r\nEarthquake.\"\r\n\r\nPage 89 refers to the \"Fossa del Vetrano;\" elsewhere there are\r\nreferences to \"Fossa della Vetrana,\" which may be what was intended.\r\nHowever, I did not change this.\r\n\r\nChanged \"hydrochloride\" to \"hydrochloric\" on page 109: \"the hydrochloric\r\nacid which it discharged.\"\r\n\r\nChanged \"disk\" to \"disc\" on page 126: \"the disc and index.\"\r\n\r\nReplaced the infinity symbol on page 131 with \"for infinity,\" in the\r\nLatin-1 text version.\r\n\r\nChanged \"azismuths\" to \"azimuths\" on page 143: \"the different azimuths.\"\r\n\r\nChanged \"silicious\" to \"siliceous\" on page 143: \"filled with siliceous\r\nsand.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Eruption of Vesuvius in 1872, by Luigi Palmieri",
