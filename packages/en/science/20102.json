He was unquestionably possessed of extraordinary abilities,\r\nfitting him for eminence in many and diverse capacities, but it cannot be\r\nsaid that he was of the first rank of illustrious generals, as the world\r\nhas been led to suppose, chiefly by the masterly but partial delineations\r\nof his career in the Peninsula by General Napier. He had a genius for war\r\nwhich qualified him for every position in connection with it but that of\r\nleader in the field. The subtle and irreversible decisions of Napoleon\r\nfollowed his astonishingly quick apprehensions of facts, as suddenly as\r\nthe thunderbolt follows lightning; but Soult, profoundly familiar with all\r\nthe arts of war, and surpassing any of the great commanders with whom he\r\nwas associated except only his chief, in the wisdom of his judgments, was\r\nyet so slow in his intellectual operations, so destitute of the\r\nenthusiasm, passion, and fire, which in high circumstance give an almost\r\nmiraculous activity to the minds of the first order of men, that he could\r\nnever have entitled himself to all the precedences he has received in\r\nhistory. Napoleon understood him, and in a few pregnant words addressed to\r\nO’Meara, gave that measure of his character which will be adopted as the\r\nfinal opinion of the world. \"He is,\" said Napoleon, \"an excellent minister\r\nat war, or major-general of an army, one who knows much better how to\r\nmanage an army than to command in chief.\"\r\n\r\nThe course of Soult as a citizen, a legislator, and a minister, was not\r\none upon which his best biographers will linger with much satisfaction.\r\nThe glory he had achieved as one of the lieutenants of Napoleon, in that\r\nturbulent and grand career which has no parallel for interest or\r\nimportance in human history, was his only claim to distinction in\r\npolitics. His master had an ambition as fair in its proportions as it was\r\nvast in its extent, and brought to every purpose the same forces of\r\ncharacter and preternatural energy of intelligence; but Soult had no love\r\nfor civil duties, but little capacity for them, and he accepted place as a\r\ngratification of vanity or a means of success in mercenary aims. We see in\r\nall his private and political life \"the soilure of his revolutionary\r\norigin,\"—proofs that he loved money and power far more than he loved\r\nhonor, and himself far more than his country or mankind.\r\n\r\nThe last of the imperial marshals, the last of that gigantic race who\r\nfilled the world with a red glory like the gloom which will precede the\r\njudgment, closed his stormy life peacefully in the place where he was\r\nborn, and thence was borne to the Invalides, to \"sleep well\" with his old\r\ncompanions.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HOMES OF COWLEY AND FOX.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have in the last _Art Journal_ another of the pleasant gossipping\r\n_Pilgrimages to English Shrines_, by Mrs. S. C. HALL, and the following\r\nabridgement of it will please all who have perused the previous papers of\r\nthe series. In Chertsey and its neighborhood are memorials of some of the\r\nnoblest men of England.\r\n\r\n                     [Illustration: ABRAHAM COWLEY.]\r\n\r\n                             ABRAHAM COWLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHERTSEY AND ITS FAMOUS CHARACTERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe county of Surrey is rich to overflowing in memories, both of persons\r\nand events, and the little quaint and quiet town of Chertsey could tell of\r\nthe gorgeous and gloomy past as much as many of its ancient neighbors\r\nwithin a day’s drive of the city. Had its old abbey stones but tongues,\r\nhow they could discourse of years when a visit to Chertsey was an\r\nundertaking; though now the distance is but half an hour.\r\n\r\nNowhere within twenty miles of London does the Thames appear more queenly,\r\nor sweep with greater grace through its fertile dominions, than it does at\r\nChertsey. It is, indeed, delightful to stand on the bridge in the glowing\r\nsunset of a summer evening, and turning from the refreshing green of the\r\nShepperton Range, look into the deep clear blue of the flowing river,\r\nwhile the murmur of the waters rushing through Laleham Lock give a sort of\r\nspirit music to the scene. On the right, as you leave Chertsey, the river\r\nbends gracefully towards the double bridge of Walton, and to the left, it\r\nundulates smoothly along, having passed Runnymede and Staines, while the\r\nalmost conical hill of St. Anne’s attracts attention by its abrupt and\r\nsingular form when viewed from the vale of the Thames.\r\n\r\nAbout a mile, on the Walton side, from our favorite bridge (Old Camden\r\ntells us so), is the spot where Cæsar crossed the Thames. Were the\r\npeasantry as imaginative as their brethren of Killarney, what legends\r\nwould have grown out of this tradition; how often would the \"noblest Roman\r\nof them all\" have been seen by the pale moonlight leading his steed over\r\nthe waters of the rapid river—how many would have heard Cassivelaunus\r\nhimself during the stillness of some particular Midsummer night working at\r\nthe rude defence which can still be traced beneath the blue waters of the\r\nThames. What hosts of pale and ghastly spectres would have risen from\r\nthose tranquil banks, and from the deepest hollows of the rushing current,\r\nand—like the Huns, who almost live on the inspired canvas of\r\nKaulbach,—fought their last earthly battle, again and again, in the spirit\r\nworld, amid the stars! But ours is no region of romance; even remnants of\r\nhistory, which go beyond the commonest capacity, are rejected as dreams,\r\nor put aside as legends. But history has enough to tell to interest us\r\nall; and we may be satisfied with the abundant enjoyment we have in\r\ndelicious rambles through the lanes and up the hills, along the fair\r\nriver’s banks, and among the many traditional ruins of ancient and\r\nbeautiful Surrey.\r\n\r\nNever was desolation more complete than in the ruin of the Mitred Abbey of\r\nChertsey; hardly one stone remains above another to tell where this\r\nstately edifice—since the far-away year 664—grew and flourished, lording\r\nit with imperial sway over, not only the surrounding villages, but\r\nextending its paternal wings into Middlesex and even as far as London. The\r\nabbey was of the Benedictine order, and founded, almost as soon as the\r\nSaxons were converted from Paganism; but it was finished and chiefly\r\nendowed by Frithwald, Earl of Surrey. The endowment prospered rarely; the\r\nestablishment increased in the reputation of wealth and sanctity; that it\r\nwas \"thickly populated\" is certain, for when the abbey was sacked and\r\nburnt by the Danes, in the ninth century, the abbot, and ninety monks,\r\nwere barbarously murdered by the invaders.\r\n\r\nStanding upon the site of their now obliterated cloisters and towers,\r\ntheir aisles and dormitories, cells and confessionals, seeing nothing but\r\nthe dank, damp grass, and the tracings of the fish-ponds—stagnant pools in\r\nour day—it is almost impossible to realize the onslaught of these wild\r\nbarbarians panting for plunder, the earnest defence of men who fought (the\r\nmonks of old could wield either sword or crosier) for life or death, the\r\nterrible destruction, the treasures and relics, and painted glass, and\r\nmonuments, the plunder of the secret almerys, the intoxicated triumph of\r\nthose rude northern hordes let loose in our fair and lovely island; what\r\nscenes of savagery, where now the jackdaw builds, and the blackbird\r\nwhistles, and the wild water-rat plays with her brood amongst the tangled\r\nweeds!\r\n\r\nThe fierce sea-kings being driven back to their frozen land, King Edgar,\r\nwilling to serve God after the fashion of his times, refounded the Abbey\r\nof Chertsey, dedicating it to St. Peter, and vying with Pope Alexander in\r\naugmenting its privileges and its wealth.\r\n\r\nSome of the abbots took great interest in home improvements, planting\r\nwoods, conducting streams, enlarging ponds—building, now a mill, now a\r\ndove-cot, according to the wants of the abbey or their own fancies. Henry\r\nI. granted them permission to keep dogs, that, according to the old\r\nchronicle, they might take \"hare, fox, and cats.\" King John, in the first\r\nyear of his reign, gave them ample confirmation of all their privileges,\r\nwhich, it would seem, they had somewhat abused, for we find that the\r\nsovereign seized their manors of Egham and \"Torp\" (Thorp) on account of a\r\nservant of the abbot’s having killed \"Hagh de Torp.\" Oh, rare \"old times!\"\r\nThe abbot was mulcted in a heavy fine. Then, while Bartholomew de\r\nWinchester was abbot, from 1272 until 1307, during the reign of our first\r\nEdward, complaints were made to Pope Gregory X. that the possessions of\r\nthe abbey were alienated to civilians and laymen, whereupon the pope\r\nissued a bull ordering such grants to be revoked.\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of note, that the Chertsey monastery sheltered, for a time,\r\nthe remains of the pious, but unfortunate, Henry VI.\r\n\r\n  \"Poor key-cold figure of a Holy King,\r\n  Pale ashes of the house of Lancaster.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the reader of Shakespeare will recall the scene in which Richard meets\r\nthe Lady Anne on her way to Chertsey with her husband’s body. This poor\r\nking’s remains had a claim to be well received by the monks of Chertsey\r\nAbbey, for he had granted to the abbot the privilege of holding a fair on\r\nSt. Anne’s-hill, then called Mount Eldebury, on the feast of St. Anne’s\r\n(the 26th of July): the fair has changed its time and quarters as well as\r\nits patron, and is held in the town on the 6th of August, and called Black\r\nCherry Fair. Manning, in his history of Surrey, says, that the tolls of\r\nthis fair were taken by the abbot, and are now taken by the owner of the\r\nsite of the Abbey House; thus the memory of King Henry VI. is commemorated\r\nin the town of Chertsey to this day, by the sale of black cherries in the\r\nharvest month of August!\r\n\r\n                    [Illustration: \"THE NUN’S WELL.\"]\r\n\r\n                            \"THE NUN’S WELL.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCenturies passed over those magnificent abbeys, whose ruins in many places\r\nadd so much beauty to our fertile landscapes; they grew and grew, and\r\nadded acre to acre, and stone to stone, and knowledge to knowledge; but\r\nmost they cherished the knowledge which blazed like a lamp under a bushel,\r\nand kept all but themselves in darkness; they preached no freedom in\r\nChrist to the Christian world, they abolished no serfdom, they taught no\r\nliberty, they enslaved even those who in their turn enslaved their \"born\r\nthralls,\" and saw no evil in it. Oh, rare old times! Better it is for us\r\nthat the site of Chertsey Abbey should be scarcely traceable now-a-days\r\nthan that it should be as it was, with its proud pageants and pent-up\r\nlearning!—Yet we have neither sympathy no respect for that foul king, who,\r\nto serve his own carnal purposes, overthrew the very faith which had\r\nhallowed his throne. But he did not attack and storm the Abbey of\r\nChertsey, as he did other religious houses. He came to them, this Eighth\r\nHarry, with a fair show of kindness, saying that \"to the honor of God, and\r\nfor the health of his soul, he proposed and most nobly intended to refound\r\nthe late Monastery, Priory, or Abbey of Bisham in Berks, and to\r\nincorporate and establish the Abbot and Convent of Chertsey, as Abbot and\r\nConvent of Bisham, and to endow them with all the Manors late belonging to\r\nBisham.\" How the then Abbot John Cordrey, and his brethren, must have\r\nshivered at the conditions; how they must have grieved at quitting their\r\ncherished home, their stews and fish-ponds, their rich meadows of Thorpe,\r\noverlooked by the woods of Eldebury hill, their nursing ground where their\r\ncalves and young lambs were stowed in luxurious safety in the pleasant\r\nfarm of Simple Marsh at Addlestone!\r\n\r\nBut their star was setting, and they were forced to \"give, sell, grant and\r\nconfirm, to the king their house and all manors belonging to them.\"\r\n\r\nThe total destruction of the Abbey must have amazed the whole country. An\r\nearthquake could hardly have obliterated it more entirely. Aubrey, writing\r\nin the year 1673, says \"of this great Abbey, scarce any thing of the old\r\nbuilding remains, except the out walls about it. Out of this ruin, is\r\nbuilt a ’fair house,’ which is now in possession of Sir Nicholas Carew,\r\nmaster of the Buckhounds.\" Dr. Stukeley alludes to this house, in a letter\r\nwritten in 1752; he speaks of the inveterate destruction, and of \"the\r\ngardener\" carrying him through a \"court\" where he saw the remains of the\r\nchurch of the Abbey. He says the \"east end reached up to an artificial\r\nmount along the garden wall; that mount and all the terraces of the\r\npleasure garden, to the back front of the house, are entirely made up of\r\nthe sacred _rudera_ or rubbish of continual devastations. Bones of abbots,\r\nmonks, and great personages, who were buried in large numbers in the\r\nchurch and cloisters which lay on the south side of the church, were\r\nspread thick all over the garden, _so that one may pick up whole handsfull\r\nof them every where amongst the garden stuff_.\" Brayley mentions in his\r\npleasant History of Surrey, that this artificial mount was levelled in\r\n1810, and its materials employed to fill up a pond. Many human skulls and\r\nbones were found intermixed with the chalk and mortar of which it had been\r\nformed. Fragments of old tiles were also frequently found, and are still\r\nsometimes turned up. No trace even of the \"Abbey house\" is left; it was\r\npurchased in 1809 by a stock-broker, who in the following year sold the\r\nmaterials—and so ends the great monastic history of Chertsey. Where are\r\nnow its spiritualities in Surrey?—its temporalities in Berkshire and\r\nHampshire?—its revenues of Stanwell, and rents of assize?—its\r\nspiritualities in Cardiganshire? Alas! they have left no sign, except on\r\nthe yellow parchment—of rare value to the antiquary.\r\n\r\nThose who desire, like ourselves, to investigate what tradition has\r\nsanctified, will do well to turn down a lane beyond Chertsey Church, which\r\nleads directly to the Abbey bridge, and there, amid tangled hedge rows and\r\norchards, stands the fragment of an arch, partly built up, and so to say,\r\ndisfigured by brick-work, and an old wall, both evidently portions of the\r\nAbbey. In the wall are a great number of what the people call \"_black\r\nstones_,\" a geological formation, making them seem fused by fire. Layers\r\nof tiles were also inserted in this wall, and where the cement has dropped\r\naway they can be distinctly traced; there is also an ivy, very aged\r\nindeed; it is so knotted and thick that it seems to grow through the\r\nstones, the soil has so evidently encroached on the wall that it is most\r\nprobably rooted at the foundation. The pleasant market garden of Mr. Roake\r\ncovers the actual ground on which the Abbey stood. The workmen frequently\r\nturn up broken tiles and human bones, and there is no doubt that by\r\ndigging deeper much would be discovered that might elucidate the history\r\nof the past. At the farther end of the market garden a vault has been\r\ndiscovered which is of considerable length and breadth; but the water\r\nrises so high in it (except after a long continuance of dry weather has\r\nsealed the land springs) that it is impossible to get to the end without\r\nwading. An enormous quantity of richly-colored and decorated encaustic\r\ntiles have been found here; some are preserved in our local museum. But\r\nthe most interesting remains in this place are the \"stews,\" or fish-ponds,\r\nwhich run parallel to each other like the bars of a gridiron; these ponds\r\ndo not communicate one with the other, nor has the water any outlet: a\r\nlittle care and attention might make them valuable for their old purposes;\r\nbut they are deplorably neglected. Occasionally you see the fin of some\r\nhuge fish, whose slow movement partakes of the character of the stagnant\r\nwater he has inhabited for years;—who can tall how many?\r\n\r\n                   [Illustration: \"THE GOLDEN GROVE.\"]\r\n\r\n                           \"THE GOLDEN GROVE.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The Abbey River,\" as it is still called, travels slowly along its way,\r\nfertilizing the meadows and imparting life and freshness to the placid\r\nscene. The denizens of Chertsey have planted orchards, and in a few\r\ninstances gardens on its banks. One, the garden of Mr. Herring, is a model\r\nof neatness, almost concealed by its roses and carefully tended shrubs. We\r\nwandered from orchard to orchard, amid the trees and over the uneven\r\nground; all was so still and lonely that it required the suggestions of an\r\nactive imagination to believe it had ever been the scene of contention by\r\nflood and field. From the Abbey Bridge the richness of the meadow scenery\r\nis exceedingly refreshing, the grass is deep and verdant, as it cannot\r\nfail to be, lying so low, and fertilized by perpetual moisture.\r\n\r\nDuring their wide-spreading magnificence, the abbots of Chertsey erected a\r\npicturesque chapel on the lovely hill of St. Anne: this was done somewhat\r\nabout the year 1334. Orleton, Bishop of Winchester, granted an indulgence\r\nof forty days to such persons as should repair to, and contribute to the\r\nfabric and its ornaments.\r\n\r\nThere is nowhere a more delightful road, than that which leads from the\r\n\"Golden Grove,\" rendered picturesque by its old tree, the plantations of\r\nMonksgrove on one side, and those of the once residence of Charles James\r\nFox on the other. The road is perfectly embowered, and so close is the\r\nfoliage that you have no idea of the beautiful view which awaits you,\r\nuntil leaving the statesman’s house to the left, you pass through a sort\r\nof wicket gate on the right, and follow a foot-path to where two\r\nmagnificent trees crown the hill; it is wisest to wait until passing along\r\nthe level ridge you arrive at the \"view point,\" and there, spread around\r\nyou in such a panorama as England only can show, and show against the\r\nworld for its extreme richness. On the left is Cooper’s Hill, which\r\nDenham, that high-priest of \"Local poetry,\" long ago made famous; in the\r\nbend just where it meets the plain, you see the towers of Windsor Castle;\r\nthere is Harrow Hill, the sun shining brightly on its tall church; a deep\r\npall hovers over London, but you can see the dome of St. Paul’s looming\r\nthrough the mist; nay, we have heard of those who have told the hour of\r\nthe day upon its broad-faced clock, with the assistance of a good glass.\r\nHow beautifully the Thames winds! Ay! there is the grand stand at Epsom,\r\nand there Twickenham, delicious, soft, balmy Twickenham; and Richmond\r\nHill—a very queen of beauty!\r\n\r\n                [Illustration: REMAINS OF CHERTSEY ABBEY.]\r\n\r\n                        REMAINS OF CHERTSEY ABBEY.\r\n\r\n\r\nYonder, beyond the valley, are Foxes Hills crowned with lofty pines—and\r\nthat is the church at Staines, and as you turn, there again is Cooper’s\r\nHill; Laleham seems spread as a tribute at your feet, and there is no end\r\nto the villages and mansions—the parks, and cottages like snow-drops in a\r\nparterre, and church spires more than we can number; while close behind us\r\nare the stones piled thickly one on the other—the only relics of the holy\r\nChapel of St. Anne.\r\n\r\nHow grandly the promontory of St. George’s Hill stands out—sheltering\r\nWeybridge, and forming a beautiful back-ground to Byfleet and the banks of\r\nthe Way; not forgetting its ruins—a Roman encampment of two thousand years\r\nage, and its modern ornaments of rare trees, of which a generous nobleman\r\nhas made common property, to be enjoyed daily by all who choose. At the\r\nfoot of this richly planted hill, is the beautiful park of Oatlands—on the\r\neve of becoming an assemblage of villa-grounds. How pleasant to feel that\r\nwe can account, by our own knowledge of that glowing mount, for all the\r\nshades formed by the hills and hollows, and different growths of trees in\r\nthe depths or heights of \"the encampment,\" which forms the delight of many\r\na toilsome antiquary. Beyond are the more distant eminences of the North\r\nDowns, and a tract of country extending into Kent. But we have not yet\r\nexplored the beauties of this our own hill of Chertsey; truly, to do so,\r\nwould take a day as long as that of its own black cherry fair.\r\n\r\nA path to the left, among the fern and heather, leads to a well, famed for\r\nits healing properties—it is called the Nun’s Well; even now, the peasants\r\nbelieve that its waters are a cure for diseases of the eye; the path is\r\nsteep and dangerous, and it is far pleasanter to walk round the brow of\r\nthe hill and overlook the dense wood which conceals the well, fringing the\r\nmeadows of Thorpe, than to seek its tangled hiding-place in the dell. The\r\nmonks of old would be sorely perplexed if they could arise, to account for\r\nthe long line of smoke which marks the passage of the different trains\r\nalong their railroads. But we turn from them to enjoy a ramble round the\r\nbrow of St. Anne’s Hill; the coppice which clothes the descent into the\r\nvalley, is so thick, that though it is intersected by many paths, you\r\nmight lose yourself half-a-dozen times within an hour; if it be evening,\r\nthe nightingales in the thickets of Monksgrove have commenced their\r\nchorus, and the town of Chertsey, down below, is seen to its full extent,\r\nits church tower toned into beauty by the rich light of the setting sun,\r\nwhile through the trees and holly thickets you obtain glimpses of the\r\nGuildford and Leatherhead hills, so softly blue, that they meet and mingle\r\nwith the sky.\r\n\r\n                   [Illustration: GATE OF FOX’S HOUSE.]\r\n\r\n                           GATE OF FOX’S HOUSE.\r\n\r\n\r\n              [Illustration: SUMMER HOUSE IN FOX’S GARDEN.]\r\n\r\n                      SUMMER HOUSE IN FOX’S GARDEN.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  [Illustration: TEMPLE OF FRIENDSHIP.]\r\n\r\n                          TEMPLE OF FRIENDSHIP.\r\n\r\n\r\nThose who feel no interest in monkish chronicles, may reverence St. Anne’s\r\nHill, because of its having been the favorite residence of Charles James\r\nFox, the contemporary of Pitt and Burke and Sheridan and Grattan, at a\r\nperiod when men felt strongly and spoke eloquently. The site of the house\r\non the south-eastern site of the hill is extremely beautiful, and it is\r\nmuch regretted in the neighborhood that it finds so little favor in the\r\nheart of its present noble proprietor. The grounds are laid out with much\r\ntaste; there is a noble cedar planted by Mrs. Fox when only the size of a\r\nwand. The statesman’s widow survived her husband more than thirty-six\r\nyears, but never outlived her friends or her faculties. There is a temple\r\ndedicated to Friendship, which was erected to perpetuate the coming of age\r\nof one of the late Lords Holland; on a pedestal ornamented by a vase, are\r\ninscribed some verses by General Fitzpatrick; another placed by Mrs. Fox\r\nto mark a favorite spot where Mr. Fox loved to muse, is enriched by a\r\nquotation from the \"Flower and the Leaf,\" concluded by two graceful\r\nstanzas:\r\n\r\n  \"Cheerful in this sequestered bower,\r\n    From all the storms of life removed;\r\n  Here Fox enjoyed his evening hour,\r\n    In converse with the friends he loved.\r\n  And here these lines he oft would quote,\r\n    Pleased from his favorite poet’s lay;\r\n  When challenged by the warbler’s note,\r\n    That breathed a song from every spray.\"\r\n\r\nAt the bottom of the garden is a grotto, which must have once possessed\r\nmany attractions, and above it there is a pretty little quaint chamber\r\nthat was used as a tea-room, when, according to the custom of the time,\r\nthe English drank tea by daylight; it is adorned by painted glass windows;\r\nthere are portraits of the Prince of Wales and Mr. Fox, when both were\r\nlooking their best, and the balcony in front commands a delicious view of\r\nthe surrounding country.\r\n\r\nThe peasantry are still loud in their praise of \"Madam Fox;\" and some\r\nremember with gratitude the education they received at her school, and\r\nlove to tell how the old lady was drawn there at \"feast times,\" to see how\r\nthey all looked in their new dresses. She certainly retained her sympathy\r\nwith the young, and put away the feelings and habits of old age with a\r\ndetermined hand, for it is said, when she was eighty she took lessons on\r\nthe harp. The present generation remember personally nothing of the great\r\nstatesman; he has become history to us, and we must look to history,\r\ngarbled as it always is, and always will be, by the opinions and feelings\r\nof its writers, to determine the position of Charles James Fox in the\r\nannals of his country. Those who were admitted to his society have written\r\nwith enthusiasm of his social qualities, and bestow equal praise on his\r\nbrilliant talents, his affability of manner, and the generosity of his\r\ndisposition. He was the third son of Henry Fox, afterwards Lord Holland,\r\nand his mother was the eldest daughter of Charles, second Duke of\r\nRichmond, and consequently great-granddaughter to Charles II.; the\r\nmaterial descent is one of blotted royalty, of which a man like Fox could\r\nnot have been proud. His academic course was unmarked by any of those\r\nhonors of which Oxford men are so ambitious, and yet, like his great\r\nrival, William Pitt, he became a statesman before he was of age.\r\n\r\n                       [Illustration: FOX’S ARBOR.]\r\n\r\n                               FOX’S ARBOR.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt St. Anne’s Hill he enjoyed as many intervals of repose and tranquillity\r\nas could fall to a statesman’s lot; in the time of wars and tumults, how\r\nhe must have luxuriated in its delicious quiet, surrounded by friends who\r\ndearly loved him; and swayed only for good by the wife who (although it is\r\nknown that her early intimacy with him was such as prevented her general\r\nrecognition in society) according to the evidence of all who knew her, was\r\nthe minister only to his better thoughts and nobler ambitions, and who\r\nweaned him from nearly all the follies and vices which stained his youth\r\nand earlier manhood. Various causes led to his death, before age had added\r\ninfirmities to disease. He died at Chiswick House, and his last words,\r\naddressed to Mrs. Fox were, \"I die happy.\" It is said he wished to be\r\nburied at Chertsey, but his remains were interred in Westminister Abbey.\r\n\r\nThe brilliant Sheridan pronounced so elegant an eulogium on his character,\r\nthat it is pleasant to think of it in those shades where, as we have said,\r\nhe so often sought and found repose: \"When Mr. Fox ceased to live, the\r\ncause of private honor and friendship lost its highest glory, public\r\nliberty its most undaunted champion, and general humanity its most active\r\nand ardent assertor. In him was united the most amiable disposition with\r\nthe most firm and resolute spirit; the mildest manners, with the most\r\nexalted mind. With regard to that great man it might, indeed, be well\r\nsaid, that in him the bravest heart and most exalted mind sat upon the\r\nseat of gentleness.\"\r\n\r\n                      [Illustration: COWLEY’S SEAT.]\r\n\r\n                              COWLEY’S SEAT.\r\n\r\n\r\n               [Illustration: COWLEY’S HOUSE—STREET FRONT.]\r\n\r\n                       COWLEY’S HOUSE—STREET FRONT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is, at all events, an imaginary pleasure in turning from the wearing\r\nout turmoil of a statesman’s life, to what the world believes the tranquil\r\ndreams of a poet’s existence. But there are few things the worldling so\r\nlittle understands as literary industry, or so little sympathizes with as\r\nliterary care. We have no inclination to over-rate either its toils or its\r\npleasures, and perhaps no life is more abundantly supplied with both. Its\r\ntoils must be evident to any who have noted the increasing literary labor\r\nwhich is necessary to produce the ordinary sources of comforts; but its\r\nhigh and holy enjoyments are not so apparent; they are so different from\r\nthose of almost all others as not to be easily explained or understood;\r\nbut above all other gifts, the marvellous gift of poesy is a distinction\r\nconferred by the Almighty, and should be acknowledged and treasured as\r\nsuch. We know little of a poet’s studies except by their imperishable\r\nproduce, and it is a common but ill-founded prejudice to imagine\r\nregularity or diligence incompatible with high genius. Genius is neither\r\nabove law, nor opposed to it; but as many have a poetic taste and\r\ntemperament _without_ the inspiration, the world is apt to mistake the\r\neccentricity of the pretender for the outward and visible sign of genius.\r\nWhether or not the poet of the Porch-house of Chertsey had the actual\r\npoetic fire we do not venture to determine. Abraham Cowley takes a\r\nprominent position, amongst the poets of our land, and the eventful times\r\nin which he lived, and his participation in their tumults give him\r\nadditional interest in all the relations of his anxious and not over-happy\r\nlife. It is recorded of him that he became a poet in consequence of\r\nreading the Faery Queene, which chance threw in his way while yet a child.\r\nIn allusion to this, Dr. Johnson gave his well-known definition of genius:\r\n\"A mind of large general powers, accidentally determined to some\r\nparticular direction.\" We had almost dared to say this is rather the\r\ndefinition of a philosopher than of one who comprehended the spirituality\r\nof a marvellous gift. Abraham Cowley—the posthumous son of a London\r\ngrocer—owed much to his mother. She, by her exertions, procured him a\r\nclassical education at Westminster School. She lived to see him loved,\r\nhonored, and great, and what was better still, and more uncommon,\r\ngrateful. At the age of fifteen he published a volume called \"Poetic\r\nBlossoms,\" which he afterwards described as \"commendable extravagancies in\r\na boy.\" He obtained a scholarship in Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1686,\r\nand there took his degree; but was ejected by the Parliament, and thence\r\nremoved to Oxford. Shortly after, he followed the Queen Henrietta to\r\nParis, as Secretary to the Earl of St. Albans, and was employed in the\r\ncourt of the exiles in the most confidential capacity. In 1656 he returned\r\nto England, and was immediately arrested as a suspected spy. He submitted\r\nquietly—the royalists thought too quietly—to the dominion of the\r\nProtector, but his whole life proved that he was no traitor. At the\r\nRestoration, that great national disappointment, his claims upon the\r\nungrateful monarch were met by a taunt and a false insinuation—he was told\r\nthat his pardon was his reward! Wood said, \"he lost the place by certain\r\nenemies of the Muses;\" certain \"friends of the Muses,\" however, procured\r\nfor him the lease of the Porch-house and farm at Chertsey, held under the\r\nQueen, and the great desire of his life—solitude—was obtained.\r\n\r\n               [Illustration: COWLEY’S HOUSE—GARDEN FRONT.]\r\n\r\n                       COWLEY’S HOUSE—GARDEN FRONT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe place still seems a meet dwelling for a poet, and is, perhaps, even\r\nmore attractive to strangers than St. Anne’s hill. The porch, which caused\r\nhis residence to be called \"The Porch-house,\" was taken down during the\r\nlast century by the father of its present proprietor, the Rev. John Crosby\r\nClarke, and the house is now known as \"Cowley House.\"(1) It is situated\r\nnear the bridge which crosses a narrow and rapid stream, in a lonely part\r\nof Guildford Street; a latticed window which overhangs the road is the\r\nwindow of the room in which the poet expired; on the outside wall Mr.\r\nClarke has recorded his reason for removing the porch. \"The porch of this\r\nhouse, which projected ten feet into the highway, was taken down in the\r\nyear 1786, for the safety and accommodation of the public.\"\r\n\r\n  \"Here the last accents flowed from Cowley’s tongue.\"\r\n\r\n                [Illustration: STAIRCASE—COWLEY’S HOUSE.]\r\n\r\n                        STAIRCASE—COWLEY’S HOUSE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe appearance of the house from Guildford Street, is no index to its size\r\nor conveniences.(2) You enter by a side gate, and the new front of the\r\ndwelling is that of a comfortable and gentlemanly home; the old part it is\r\nsaid was built in the reign of James the First, and what remains is\r\nsufficiently quaint to bear out the legend; the old and new are much\r\nmingled, and the modern part consists of one or two bed-rooms, a large\r\ndining-room, and a drawing-room, commanding a delicious garden view, the\r\nmeanderings of the stream, and a long tract of luxuriant meadows,\r\nterminated by the high and richly timbered ground of St. Anne’s Hill. A\r\nportion of the old stairway is preserved, the wood is not as has been\r\nstated oak, but sweet chestnut. One of the rooms is panelled with oak, and\r\nCowley’s study is a small closet-like chamber, the window looking towards\r\nSt. Anne’s Hill. It is never difficult to imagine a poet in a _small\r\nchamber_, particularly when his mind may imbibe inspiration from so rich\r\nand lovely a landscape. Beside the group of trees, beneath whose shadow\r\nthe poet frequently sat, there is a horse chestnut of such exceeding size\r\nand beauty, that it is worthy a pilgrimage, and no lover of nature could\r\nlook upon it without mingled feelings of reverence and affection.\r\n\r\nHere then amid such tranquil scenes, and such placid beauty, the\r\n\"melancholy Cowley,\" passed the later days of big anxious existence; here\r\nwe may fancy him receiving Evelyn and Denham, the poets and men of letters\r\nof his troubled day, who found the disappointments of courtly life more\r\nthan their philosophy could endure. Here his friendly biographer, Doctor\r\nSpratt, cheered his lonely hours.\r\n\r\nCowley was one of those fortunate bards who obtain fame and honor during\r\nlife. His learning was deep, his reading extensive, his acquaintance with\r\nmankind large. \"To him,\" says Denham in his famous elegy,\r\n\r\n  \"To him no author was unknown,\r\n  Yet what he wrote was all his own.\"\r\n\r\nHis biographer adds, \"There was nothing affected or singular in his habit,\r\nor person, or gesture; _he understood the forms of good breeding enough to\r\npractise them without burdening himself or others_.\" This indeed is the\r\nperfection of good breeding and good sense.\r\n\r\nHaving obtained, as we have said, the Porch-house at Chertsey, his mind\r\ndwelt with pleasure—a philosophic pleasure—upon the hereafter, which he\r\nhoped for in this life of tranquillity, and the silent labor he so dearly\r\nloved; but he was destined to prove the reality of his own poesy:\r\n\r\n  \"Oh life, thou _Nothing’s_ younger brother,\r\n  So _like_ that one might take one for the other.\"\r\n\r\nThe career of Abraham Cowley was never sullied by vice,(3) he was loyal\r\nwithout being servile, and at once modest, independent and sincere. His\r\ncharacter is eloquently drawn by Doctor Spratt. \"He governed his passions\r\nwith great moderation, his virtues were never troublesome or uneasy to\r\nany, whatever he disliked in others he only corrected by the silent\r\nreproof of a better practice.\"\r\n\r\nHe died at Chertsey on the 28th of July, 1667, and was interred in\r\nWestminster Abbey. A throng of nobles followed him to his grave, and the\r\nworthless king who had deserted him is reported to have said, that Mr.\r\nCowley had not left a better man behind him in England.\r\n\r\nIt is said the body of Cowley was removed from Chertsey by water, thus\r\nmaking the Thames he loved so well, the highway to his grave; there is\r\nsomething highly poetic in this idea of a funeral, so still and solemn,\r\nwith the oars dropping noiselessly in the blue water. Pope in allusion to\r\nit, says:\r\n\r\n  \"What tears the river shed,\r\n  When the sad pomp along his banks was led;\"\r\n\r\nwhich rather inclines us to the belief, that in this, as in many other\r\ninstances, the poetic reading is not the true one,\r\n\r\n  \"The muses oft in lands of vision play:\"\r\n\r\nbut the fact that he died at Chertsey, as much respected as a man, as he\r\nwas admired as a poet, is certain, and his house is often visited by\r\nstrangers, who are permitted to see his favorite haunts by the kindness of\r\nits proprietor, who honors the spot so hallowed by memories of \"the\r\nmelancholy Cowley:\"—he who considered and described \"business\" as:\r\n\r\n  \"The contradiction to his fate.\"\r\n\r\nBut we must postpone our farther rambles for the present.\r\n\r\n                 [Illustration: TREES ON ST ANNE’S HILL.]\r\n\r\n                         TREES ON ST ANNE’S HILL.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChertsey loses half its romantic interest by the intrusion of the\r\nprogressive agents of our time—our noisy time, of which the spirit\r\nwillingly brooks no souvenirs of monastic repose. The old quaint quiet\r\ntown has now its railroad, and the shades of its heroes have departed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTRAUGOTT BROMME ON THE UNITED STATES OF NORTH AMERICA, TEXAS AND THE\r\nCOLONIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have at different times, by reviews or translations, endeavored to give\r\nour readers some idea of what people think of us, in continental Europe.\r\nBut there are two sides to every thing—or there is an universal dualism,\r\nas Emerson declares—which is perfectly true as to the method which might\r\nbe adopted in the execution of this self-imposed task. One class of\r\nreaders understand by the word _people_ the _beau monde_, and would have\r\nus invariably follow the school of the Countesses Hahn-Hahn or Ladies\r\nBlessington or Milords Fitz-Flummery, contented if we have but a fair name\r\nin society. Another and more reasonable class would be satisfied to know\r\nthe opinion of the literati, or perhaps the poets, particularly when they\r\ndo fit homage to our \"grand old woods,\" and to Niagara. Others regard with\r\nmost respect a plain literal account of our branches of industry—our\r\nrailroads, factories, and canals. They would have the country judged\r\npurely from a mechanical or practical point of view—contenting themselves\r\nas to other matters with the reflection. \"Oh, sensible people care very\r\nlittle about any thing else. If they know what we produce, and what our\r\nresources are, they’ll understand and respect us sufficiently.\"\r\n\r\nNow the opinion of each of these classes has its weight, and though not of\r\nthe _greatest_ ultimate importance, is always to be respected. If we were\r\nquestioned as to the views of which of them we yielded full regard, we\r\nshould candidly say, \"to none.\" It is the general, universal opinion, of a\r\nnation at large that we deem authoritative, and none other. It is that\r\npopular opinion so readily yet often so falsely formed (at times from\r\ntrifles of almost incredible levity), and which when once fairly\r\ndeveloped, is well-nigh ineradicable. In a word, it is to the views of the\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nWe propose, as opportunity shall offer, to make our readers familiar with\r\nthe writings of all these different classes of travellers—and in the\r\npresent article, we shall make a few extracts from a work interesting, as\r\nhaving probably contributed more than any other to a general knowledge of\r\nthe United States in Germany. It is the book which has had the greatest\r\ncurrency among all classes, but particularly with the lower order of\r\nreaders and emigrants.\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding, however, to the work itself, it may be as well to\r\nanswer a question which has perhaps been suggested to the minds of a\r\ncertain class of readers. Of what great use, after all, is this nervous\r\nregard as to the opinion of the world? Is not our character\r\nestablished—are not our characteristics known, to the uttermost corners of\r\nthe earth? To which question we may answer, _Not quite_. In avoiding that\r\nridiculous sensitiveness which prompts so many Americans to feel\r\npersonally insulted by the weak remarks of every wandering ignoramus, we\r\nwould by no means fall into the opposite error of attaching no importance\r\nwhatever to the good opinion or the degree of consciousness as to our\r\nexistence entertained by the world at large.\r\n\r\nShould any feel disposed to smile at such an expression, as \"the\r\nconsciousness of our existence,\" we will take the liberty of citing a few\r\ncurious instances, for the authenticity of which we assume the entire\r\nresponsibility—instances which may perhaps astonish a few even of the\r\nbetter informed. There are in many districts (not altogether provincial)\r\nof Italy and France great numbers, who would not even in America be\r\nclassed as _ignorant_ in regard to other matters, who have not the\r\nremotest idea as to the nature or geography of our country. An instance\r\nhas come to our knowledge of an intelligent Hungarian who, by intercourse\r\nwith the world, had acquired a fluency in five languages, and who inquired\r\nof an American gentleman if his country were not situated somewhere in\r\nEngland. The late Mr. Cooper, when placing his daughters at a celebrated\r\nseminary on the continent, found a great curiosity had been created by the\r\nrumor that they were coming, some supposing they were black, some that\r\nthey were copper-colored, and all unprepared to see American girls looking\r\nfor all the world like the young German ladies. We have heard of a similar\r\ninstance in which an English _gentleman_—a Cambridge graduate—inquired of\r\nan American what was the current language of the United States. Lastly, we\r\nmay cite the case of an English author, well known to our own public, and\r\nfavorably mentioned not long since in these pages, who was under the\r\nimpression that owing to the great emigration from Germany, the English\r\nlanguage must with us, in a very few years, yield to that of the\r\n_Vaterland_. Now our commercial and industrial relations are seriously\r\nhindered by this absurd ignorance of America, which in a word prevails to\r\nsuch an extent, that we have known an American, who—probably from having\r\nbeen over-questioned and speered at in New England—had imbibed such a\r\nwholesome hatred of inquisitiveness, that he wished the French government\r\nwould hang up, for the benefit of all concerned, the following list of\r\nquestions, with satisfactory answers annexed, in all the _cafés_ of the\r\npolitest nation in Europe:\r\n\r\n      Whether America is an island or a continent?\r\n      What is the color of its inhabitants?\r\n      What language do they speak?\r\n      Have they a religion and what is it?\r\n      What is the state of their morals and cookery?\r\n      Have they a correct state of feeling as regards the opera?\r\n\r\nThe reader is not to infer that this is the general state of knowledge\r\nregarding our country. But it is worth nothing as a curious illustration\r\nof the vast number of individuals who derive their ideas, not from what is\r\ngoing on at the present day, or from available sources of information, but\r\nfrom the antiquated views of a by-gone generation. And we trust it will\r\nnot be deemed inappropriate that we here speak a word of the want of\r\nopportunities of acquiring very general information under which the\r\nordinary readers of continental Europe suffer. With all their libraries,\r\nall their immense arrays of magazines and journals, we find among them an\r\napathy in regard to the world without (to the Fan-Qui), which appears\r\nincredible until we reflect on the deadening influences of the censorship,\r\nwhich views with distrust all information in regard to the Land of\r\nLiberty. We are not aware, throughout the whole of continental Europe, of\r\na single publication so thoroughly cosmopolite in its character, so\r\ngeneral in the scope of its information, or which is so universally\r\ndisseminated among _all_ classes of readers, as _The International_; and\r\nwe trust we do not go too far when we assert, that it is to an extended\r\nsale of periodical publications somewhat approaching it in the\r\nconcentration and dissemination of news from the world at large, that our\r\ncountrymen owe that superior intelligence and citizen-of-the-world\r\ncharacter which distinguish them from the insular Briton, self-important\r\nFrenchman, or abstracted German.\r\n\r\nThe work from which we propose to make some extracts, is TRAUGOTT BROMME’s\r\n_Hand und Reisebuch für Auswanderer nach den Vereinigten Staaten_ (or\r\nTraugott Bromme’s Journey and Handbook for Emigrants to the United\r\nStates). As we have already stated, no work on America is at the present\r\nday more familiarly known to that class of readers to whom it is\r\naddressed. Certain remarks on the present condition of German emigration\r\nwith which it is prefaced, may not be devoid of interest to our readers,\r\nthough not constituting a part of such observations as we have more\r\nparticularly referred to:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"There is, it appears, implanted in every man an impulse to\r\n    advance and better his condition—an impulse caused by poverty,\r\n    dependent circumstances, or pressure from every side, vexing at\r\n    times even the highest in rank, and which is the cause why\r\n    thousands leave their fatherland, to seek afar a now home, and\r\n    hundreds of thousands cast around them disturbed and anxious\r\n    glances, restrained only by hard poverty, which imprisons them at\r\n    home. Such is very generally the case at present in our own\r\n    country, where—despite the political concessions of March in the\r\n    year 1848, of the published original privileges of the German\r\n    people, and of the promising prospect of a free and united\r\n    Germany, with a concluding general empire—emigration appears to be\r\n    by no means on the decrease.\" \"These emigrants of the present day\r\n    consist not as formerly of poor people of the lower orders, who\r\n    turn their backs on the German fatherland, or liberal declaimers,\r\n    dreaming of an ideal of freedom which could scarcely be realized\r\n    in Utopia, but of sober excellent families of the middle class,\r\n    who, free from all delusive fancies, do not expect to find in the\r\n    western world wealth and honorable offices, but desire only to\r\n    inhabit a land, wherein they may dwell quietly and happily with\r\n    their children.\" \"What the German wants is _room_—a new broad\r\n    field for his abilities—and this America extends to him in\r\n    unbounded space. No one at the present day hopes to obtain hills\r\n    of gold without labor, but every one knows that the far more\r\n    estimable treasure of perfect independence, or to speak more\r\n    correctly, of perfect _self-dependence_, with the prospect of a\r\n    future free from care, may in America be obtained at the cost of a\r\n    few years of earnest, honest industry. And what, to the man\r\n    oppressed in his fatherland by all the cares incident upon the\r\n    obtaining a bare subsistence, is two or three or even _four_ years\r\n    of hard work, when compared to a whole life of poverty and\r\n    misery?\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter accurately sketching the extreme misery and poverty oppressing the\r\ninhabitants of many districts of Germany, of late years sadly increased by\r\nthe falling off in manufactures since the political disturbances, our\r\nauthor proceeds to set forth the advantages offered by America:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"That most emigrants should rather look to America, than Poland,\r\n    Russia, Servia, or Siebenburgen, is natural enough, since all of\r\n    these countries together cannot offer so many attractions as\r\n    America. Where on earth is there such a vast array of unoccupied\r\n    lands, offered at such a moderate price—land so cheap that in many\r\n    districts twenty or thirty and even more acres, covered with wood,\r\n    are given at a price for which a single acre of similar land is\r\n    sold in Germany?\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe richness of the soil, the excellence of the climate, and the demand\r\nfor labor, are then described; to which, as the greatest inducement, he\r\nadds the fact that in _America_ the fullest \"liberty of labor and\r\nmechanical calling or trade,\" is allowed. Also, that the taxes are so\r\nlight that an industrious man is able not only to live, but even to lay up\r\nsomething for his old age, or his children, or to employ in the extension\r\nof his business.\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"For as there exists in America no standing army, its inhabitants\r\n    may retain their children, as the best possible assistants in\r\n    labor, and train, govern, and discipline them as can only properly\r\n    done under the eye of a parent. Furthermore, in that country every\r\n    one is permitted to enjoy the fullest civil and religious liberty.\r\n    These are the advantages to be expected from an emigration to\r\n    America, _and he who anticipates more will find himself bitterly\r\n    deceived_. But a man who can be content with this, and can live\r\n    actively, moderately, and frugally, will here, better than in any\r\n    other land in the world, ultimately attain to happiness and\r\n    fortune. In times like ours, when every branch of industry is\r\n    crowded, when tender parents think with grief and trouble on the\r\n    future prospects of their children, there are for the emigrant no\r\n    other resources save those held out by a full and bountiful\r\n    nature, and no means of livelihood which may be so certainly\r\n    depended upon as those afforded by agriculture. Here it is that\r\n    industry throws open the widest field, and affords the fullest\r\n    opportunity of doing good.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the following extract, our author proceeds to set forth the national\r\ncharacter of the American:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"The national character of the American has been greatly\r\n    misunderstood; few travellers seem, in fact, to have understood\r\n    it, since they mention it as something as new and unfounded as the\r\n    country itself, and yet it is so well confirmed—so well\r\n    established in every elevated and noble characteristic of the\r\n    human race, that it may confidently be placed in comparison with\r\n    that of the most celebrated nations of antiquity. Springing\r\n    originally from England, they have the pride and manly confidence\r\n    of the Briton, for through their ancestry they claim an equal\r\n    share of all which gives dignity to those inheriting glory and a\r\n    great name. Their forefathers were those brave religious pilgrims\r\n    who were transferred by British laws (or rather by old German) and\r\n    British genius to the shores of the new world—to there give to\r\n    those laws and genius an immortality. Building still further on\r\n    this new land, they opened the temple of the Lord to all his\r\n    followers, and received with open arms all the unfortunate or\r\n    oppressed exiles of Europe. For the first time in reality in this\r\n    world they flung wide the flag of truth and freedom—fought under\r\n    its folds an unequal fight against the mightiest power in the\r\n    world—and overcame it. And when a second time they armed\r\n    themselves to combat with England, they again came forth\r\n    unconquered from the contest. Reason enough this for the national\r\n    pride of the American, for nothing could more naturally cause a\r\n    certain degree of self-content than to belong to a nation whose\r\n    brilliant deeds in war as in politics, in commerce as in\r\n    manufactures, have astonished the world. A second and not less\r\n    characteristic trait of the American is seen in a certain\r\n    earnestness, which appears to strangers to indicate a want of\r\n    sociable feeling—and yet perhaps in _no_ country is true noble\r\n    sociability as developed in domestic life, so much at home, as in\r\n    America.\r\n\r\n    \"Accustomed from his cradle to reflect on himself and his\r\n    circumstances, the American from the first instant of his entry\r\n    into active life is ever on the watch to improve their condition.\r\n    Is he rich, and consequently more directly interested in the\r\n    common wealth, then every new law, every change in the personal\r\n    direction of the government, awakes in him a new care for the\r\n    future, while on the other hand, if poor, then every change in the\r\n    state may perhaps afford him a new opportunity of bettering his\r\n    condition. Therefore he is ever wide awake—ever looking out for\r\n    the future, not as a mere spectator, but as one playing a part and\r\n    occupied in maintaining the present state of affairs, or in\r\n    improving them. The entire mass of the population is continually\r\n    in a state of political agitation, and, urged by hope of their aid\r\n    or fear of their power, we see every one continually seeking for\r\n    expressions of public opinion. No man is so rich or powerful that\r\n    he need not fear them—none so wretched and poor but that he may\r\n    venture to entertain the hope of being through them aided and\r\n    relieved. Public opinion is in America the mightiest organ of\r\n    justice—shielding no one, from the president to the simplest\r\n    citizen, and proceeds, mowing, casting down, or grinding to powder\r\n    all things which oppose it and deserve its condemnation.\r\n\r\n    \"This condition of perpetual agitation gives the American an\r\n    appearance of ceaseless restlessness, but it is in reality the\r\n    true ground of peace and content. _The American has no time to be\r\n    discontented_, and this is the most praiseworthy point of their\r\n    constitution and popular life. The republican has necessarily as\r\n    many severe and arduous duties to fulfil as the inhabitants of any\r\n    monarchy—but their fulfilment is gratifying and consoling—for it\r\n    is allied to the consciousness of power. The American has no\r\n    desire for the quiet temper of the European, and least of all for\r\n    the silent happiness of the German, which last, alas! appears\r\n    since the dissipation of the intoxication of the Revolution of\r\n    March, 1848, to consist, as far as the great mass of the\r\n    population is concerned, merely in the egotistic repose of\r\n    self-sufficiency, weakness, and ignorance. The American finds\r\n    repose only in his house, in his family circle, and among his\r\n    children; all without the walls of that home is an incessant\r\n    working and striving, in politics as in trade—by the streets and\r\n    canals, as in the woods of the West. Different as the elements are\r\n    from which the inhabitants of the United States are formed, and\r\n    different as the circumstances may be under which they live, there\r\n    still prevails among them a certain unity of character, an\r\n    equanimity of feeling, which it would be difficult to parallel,\r\n    resulting perhaps from the very heterogeneousness and mixture of\r\n    elements itself, since no one element allows to another\r\n    pre-eminence. They have all something in common in their\r\n    appearance, which gives them the air almost of relations—something\r\n    in their gait and manners which declares them to be other than\r\n    English, Germans, or French. Through the entire land, through\r\n    every class, there is disseminated a certain refinement of manner,\r\n    an appreciation of decency and nobility of character, which\r\n    springs from a consciousness of their own rights and respect for\r\n    mankind. Even emigrants, in America, soon learn to cast aside\r\n    their rough prejudices as regards caste, for the proud affability\r\n    of the aristocratic, the vanity of the small citizen, the want of\r\n    confidence and ease in the mechanic, the slavish servitude and\r\n    snappish insolence of liveried servants, find in America no place.\r\n    _Man_ is there esteemed only as _man_—only ability gains honor—and\r\n    where _that_ is, and there alone, can true nobility be found. No\r\n    one there inquires who a man is, or who were his parents, but\r\n    ’What can he _do_, what are his capabilities, and what can he\r\n    produce?’ Rank and caste are in America unknown. Every man feels\r\n    his freedom and independence, and expresses himself accordingly.\r\n    Even the servant is a free man, who has, it is true, hired his\r\n    service, but not his entire existence. The American is polite, but\r\n    over-refined, unmeaning compliments form no part of his manners,\r\n    nor does he expect them from others. No man vexes or troubles\r\n    himself for another, in consequence of which we find in American\r\n    society very little stiffness and reserve, yet we find in every\r\n    respect that the very highest regard is there paid to propriety\r\n    and decency—particularly as regards the female sex, since in no\r\n    country, not even in England, do ladies enjoy such respect and\r\n    regard as in the United States. Ever depending upon, and confiding\r\n    in himself, the American is in his manners free, open, and\r\n    unreserved. The mass of the people is possessed of intelligence\r\n    and spirit, though not so scientifically educated as in Europe,\r\n    and a higher degree of intelligence penetrates even the lower\r\n    class, who consequently form a marked and singular contrast with\r\n    those of like rank in Europe. It is not from being versed in the\r\n    higher branches of abstract learning and science, but from the\r\n    great amount of that direct practical knowledge which exerts the\r\n    greatest influence in making life happy, that the Americans are\r\n    distinguished from other nations, and for the acquisition of which\r\n    they have made better provision and preparation than any other\r\n    people. As yet too deeply occupied with the Needful and Important,\r\n    they are compelled to leave the development of the higher branches\r\n    to the care and noble generosity of individuals. But a glance at\r\n    the sums which are annually devoted to the establishment and\r\n    maintenance of schools and universities, will suffice to evidence\r\n    the liberality with which the proper education of the people is\r\n    cared for in the United States. Knowledge is indeed esteemed, but\r\n    only according to its use and applicability to the wants of life;\r\n    so that a practical tanner is there worth more than a learned\r\n    pedant. _Wealth, or rather wealth allied to ability and\r\n    universality of talent, is there more highly esteemed than\r\n    learning,_ while hospitality, patriotism, and toleration, allowing\r\n    every one to think and feel as he likes, are universal\r\n    characteristics. So that in the United States nothing is wanting\r\n    to the attainment of a true civil and social freedom, even though\r\n    the means thereto are not invariably correctly understood or\r\n    admitted (as is indeed the case by us), and though—since men are\r\n    every where subject to the same weaknesses—they measure happiness\r\n    rather by the standard of their own intelligence and virtues, than\r\n    by fortune and nature, which latter, impartially considered, is\r\n    the basis of the physical happiness of the American. That,\r\n    however, which constitutes his _moral_ happiness is this; that in\r\n    his country, domestic life enjoys the true supremacy, _and to\r\n    this, public life and the state are subordinate_. It is true that\r\n    the American statesmen have fallen into the same error as the\r\n    European—_id est_, to believe that without _them_ the people could\r\n    never prosper, and still live in the belief that home-happiness\r\n    hangs on them, their theories and arts of governing; but the most\r\n    superficial glance teaches that if wise laws are able to effect\r\n    more for the happiness of man than they can bring about, still no\r\n    one should _there_ attempt to draw happiness from such a source\r\n    when popular and private life have combined to bestow it. But\r\n    should the happiness of the Americans ever be derived from this\r\n    side, it will be more sensible to assume that the foundation\r\n    thereof will be the release from that which in the recent culture\r\n    has passed for the deepest political wisdom. The true secret of\r\n    all the good fortune of America lies in the favorable condition of\r\n    external things. ’It is not with them as in Europe, where the poor\r\n    can only better their condition or become rich by making the rich\r\n    poor, for therein lies the source of an infinite strife which hath\r\n    been combated for centuries, with the axioms of religion and\r\n    morals. But in America, men when striving to better their\r\n    condition, instead of becoming enemies and turning their arms\r\n    against each other, strive with _Nature_, and wring from her\r\n    boundless stores that wealth which she so bountifully affords!’\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have made these quotations less on account of any merit which they\r\npossess, than to give our readers an idea of the general opinion\r\nprevailing in Germany in regard to our country; and to confirm an\r\nassertion made in a recent number of the _International_, that in no\r\ncountry in Europe are we so impartially and favorably judged. There is one\r\nparticular, however, in which we find this book worthy of especial praise.\r\nThe author highly commends the flourishing state of religion in the United\r\nStates, declaring that we are in this respect superior to the Germans, and\r\nthat on the Sabbath the churches are filled to a degree unknown in Europe.\r\nIt is from our deep-rooted attachment to domestic life, and our observance\r\nof religion, that he correctly deduces our true happiness, as separated\r\nfrom the natural advantages of the country. It is greatly to be desired\r\nthat the majority of his countrymen resident in America, would allow\r\nthemselves to be impressed in a similar manner as to the advantages of\r\npiety and Sabbath-keeping. There is in the United States a vast number of\r\nGerman newspapers—conducted we should imagine for the greater part by\r\nunprincipled and worthless adventurers of the red republican, socialist\r\nstamp, who, despite the protection which they here enjoy, incessantly and\r\nspitefully abuse every institution to which they are really indebted for\r\ntheir asylum among us, and most of all our observation of the Sabbath, in\r\na style which entitles them to something severer than mere contempt. But\r\nHerr Bromme is right. Respect for morality and religion, a due regard for\r\nthe Sabbath, and a dependence on the home-circle for pleasure and\r\nrecreation, are the surest safeguard of peace, happiness, and prosperity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA VISIT TO THE FIRE WORSHIPPERS’ TEMPLE AT BAKU.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a recent number of the _Russian Archives for Scientific Information_,\r\nis an account of a visit made by a Russian lady of distinction, in company\r\nwith her husband and sons, to a temple of the Indian sect of Gebers, or\r\nFire Worshippers, near Baku, a city of Georgia, lying on the Caspian Sea.\r\nWe translate this interesting narrative for the _International_, as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nIn order the better to enjoy the spectacle of the fire, we chose the\r\nevening for our excursion thither; but a thick fog came on, which made the\r\nroad difficult and dangerous. When we finally reached the place it was\r\npitch dark; the flames were rising in beautiful purity to the peaceful sky\r\nof night, and the entire castle, within which was the temple, seemed to be\r\nsurrounded by a circle of watch-fires. These were lighted by Persians from\r\nthe neighborhood, who were busy burning lime and baking bread, dark forms\r\nlike those which worked on the tower of Babel, and burnt lime for it. They\r\nwere now brought here by the ease and cheapness of carrying on their\r\noccupations. All that is necessary is to make a hole in the ground, touch\r\na burning coal to it, and an inexhaustible flame rises forth like a\r\nspring. Behind this range of little flames and fires, rose, in the pale\r\nlight, the dirty white walls of the castle, in the centre of which there\r\nflashed from the summit of two lofty pillars great masses of the purest,\r\nclearest, and keenest flame, which were now bent down horizontally and\r\nwreathed like serpents by the force of the wind, and now rose\r\nperpendicularly to the sky, whose dome they lighted up like two vast altar\r\ntapers. We drove around the edifice, and stopped on one side where there\r\nwere no flames rising from the earth. A fine rain was falling, but we\r\nremained without while our guide went in to announce us. He came back\r\nimmediately with a swarthy Hindoo. The sight of this man impressed me\r\nstrangely, and I forgot that he belonged to a remote colony of a few\r\nindividuals, and asked myself if we had been suddenly transported to\r\nIndia, or if India had been brought up to the Caspian.\r\n\r\nWe went into the court-yard, in which stands the temple, with its two\r\nfire-pillars. About half way up hang a couple of large bells, which the\r\nHindoo sounded by way of preparing us for what we were to see. There was\r\nsomething fearful in the loud clangor, and my boys crowded close beside\r\nme. Except our party, no one was to be seen except the swart Geber, in his\r\nwhite turban and long brown robe, with just enough of a pair of light blue\r\ntrowsers visible to bring into distinctness his naked black feet. His\r\nfeatures were noble, and his beard long and black. He looked like a\r\nconjurer, like the lord of an enchanted castle, summoning his spirits. The\r\nhissing fire, as if obeying him, flashed up more brightly at the crash of\r\nthe bells; now it was clear as day around us, and now it was twilight as\r\nthe wind lowered the flame. My husband and sons and the guide who had\r\nbrought us to the place, were all dressed in oriental costume, and I alone\r\nseemed to belong to Europe. A shudder of home-sickness came over me, and\r\nat every moment I expected to see something monstrous, to behold all the\r\ncruelties of a heathenish and barbarous worship.\r\n\r\nThe interpreter now summoned us to follow the Geber. We were told that the\r\ncastle was built by a rich Indian nabob, who was a fire worshipper, and\r\nwho, with his followers, long inhabited it. Now, only three Hindoos remain\r\nfrom that period of splendor. But nature remains eternally the same, and\r\nwhether worshipped or not, the flames still shine and awe the\r\nsuperstitious, and so great is the fame of the place that many pilgrims\r\ncome yearly from distant India to pray, and to have prayers said for them,\r\nhere in the visible presence of the primeval light.\r\n\r\nAt last we came to the cell of the priest, and on his invitation entered\r\nit. We passed through a low door, and down a few steps, and found\r\nourselves in a small, semicircular, low, but very white room, with a floor\r\nof mason-work, and a small altar in the centre. Around the wall were\r\nseats, also of mason-work. In the altar there was an opening as large as a\r\ngun-barrel, from which rose a slender flame that lighted the room very\r\nclearly. There were other little openings on the sides of the altar. The\r\nHindoo took a wisp of straw, lighted it, and touched these openings, from\r\nwhich the most beautiful flames at once issued. The children, who had\r\nnever seen gas lights, or at least did not remember them, regarded all\r\nthis as the most perfect witchery. On a second altar, which, like the\r\nfirst, was about the height of a common table, lay or stood the idols and\r\ntreasures of our priest. Small steps led up to it, which were used to hold\r\nmuscles, stones, shells, and other instruments employed in the sacred\r\nrites. The idols were of metal, and ugly and monstrous, like Chinese\r\nimages. Beside these figures, we were astonished to see crosses of various\r\nforms and sizes. We asked the Geber about them, and he answered with\r\noriental emphasis: \"There is one God, and no one has seen him; therefore\r\nevery one adores him after his own way, and represents him after his own\r\nway.\" The reply was diplomatic enough, and we could not ascertain how the\r\ncrosses had come there.\r\n\r\nOn the altar and its steps lay a great number of singularly beautiful\r\nIndian stones, which the boys wanted very much, but which, in spite of our\r\nlarge offers, we could not obtain. They were mementoes from the distant\r\nfatherland, and possibly they served as sacred ornaments for the little\r\ncell. There were also several censers, lamps, and little silver plates and\r\nsalvers. The air was stifling from the fumes of gas, and the heat was like\r\nthat of a vapor bath. The priest took from the altar some pieces of red\r\nand white candied sugar, held them, praying, before his idols, sprinkled\r\nthem with holy water, and handed them to us on a silver plate.\r\n\r\nA second Hindoo now came in, a tall old man, whose name, as he told us,\r\nwas Amintaas. He invited us into his cell, which was larger and\r\ndifferently arranged. In the centre was a large kettle, set in mason-work,\r\nwith water in it, and a gas flame burning under it; the altar was in\r\nanother apartment beyond, and separated from the first by a low wall or\r\nfence, with a passage through. Another apartment, similarly divided off,\r\nwas spread with carpets for sleeping. After we had seen the stones,\r\nshells, and idols, which were richer and more numerous than in the former\r\ncell, the Hindoos asked us if they should pray for us. We agreed, and the\r\nceremony began. A large muscle shell was washed in the kettle, the plates\r\nwere set in order at the foot of the altar, a censer began to smoke, the\r\nsilver plate with candied sugar was set over a lamp Between two bells,\r\nwhose handles were the most monstrous figures of idols. These bells\r\nAmintaas took and began to ring vehemently. The other Hindoos stood behind\r\nhim and beat two big cymbals, accompanying this noise with the most\r\ninhuman and frightful howling that a man’s lungs ever produced. Still,\r\nthere was method and a regular cadence in it. Finally, they made a pause,\r\nbowed before the images, murmuring softly, after which they arranged the\r\nplates anew, and sprinkled the sugar with holy water. My husband whispered\r\nin my ear a line from the conjuration in \"Faust,\" and the whole of that\r\nscene rushed vividly into my memory.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the lungs of the old Amintaas had recovered their power, for he\r\nnow seized a conch shell, held it in both hands, and with incredible\r\nstrength blew long wild notes, with scarce any thing like a tune. I grew\r\ndizzy in listening to this clamor, and at once understood what is meant by\r\nthe heathen making a \"vain noise,\" This cannibalistic music was kept up\r\nfor a long time, and seemed to form the climax of the sacred rites. The\r\nfinale was a combination of wild shouting, banging of the cymbals, ringing\r\nand murmuring. At last the concert was over, and we breathed freely.\r\nAmintaas handed us the candied sugar, and my husband laid down two ducats\r\nin its place. They were received with warm expressions of gratitude, and\r\nlaid upon the altar. We went out into the open air, but the scene had\r\nchanged. The lonely castle was crowded with Persians who had come from\r\ntheir lime-burning to see the Europeans. Persian women were sitting around\r\nby sundry little ovens of masonry, where, by the help of gas flames, they\r\nbaked their _Tsheuks_, thin cakes of unleavened bread. Followed by the\r\ncrowd, we were led a couple of hundred steps from the castle to a spring\r\nthat was covered over; the cover was taken off, and a bundle of burning\r\nstraw thrown in, when, crackling and hissing, sprung up a splendid pillar\r\nof fire, vanishing in sparks like stars. This beautiful spectacle lasted\r\nbut for a moment, and a quarter of an hour was necessary to collect gas\r\nenough to repeat the experiment.\r\n\r\nWe returned to Baku in the rain, more dead than alive. It was the eve of\r\nEaster. The next morning, as I was sitting on the sofa with the children,\r\nthere came in a tall, meagre Hindoo, with gray hair; he was dressed in a\r\nwhite robe, and brought me white and red sugar on a silver plate. He was\r\nthe chief priest from the temple of the Gebers, and had come to Baku to\r\nsee the Easter festivities. We took a few grains of his sugar, and I laid\r\na silver rouble on the plate. While he was making his bows for this, my\r\nhusband came in and told him, partly in Tartar, partly in Russian, and\r\npartly in pantomime, that we had been to his temple the night before, and\r\nhad prayers said there. He asked at once, with eagerness, how much we had\r\ngiven, and when he learned the sum, asked for a certificate to that\r\neffect, as, without it, the others would give him no part of the money. We\r\nsent him away without granting his request, for the two screamers of the\r\nnight previous had earned all we gave them. We learned afterwards that the\r\ngifts of visitors occasioned quarrels, and often blows, in the romantic\r\nfire-castle. This disgusted me, and yet it is not the fault of these poor\r\nfellows. They must necessarily become covetous, since they profane their\r\nmost sacred ceremonies as a means of living. They have neither fields nor\r\ngardens, and the only thing like vegetation that I saw was some lone boxes\r\nin the court yard, filled with shrubs and plants, remains, no doubt, from\r\nthe time of the Indian nabob, who sought in vain to establish cultivation\r\nin a soil impregnated with inflammable gas. However, I learned to my\r\nsorrow that grass at least grows there, for, in going through it to the\r\nspring, my feet became perfectly wet.\r\n\r\nThe air of the locality does not seem to be unwholesome for man. At least,\r\nthe Geber priests, who had lived there for years, were perfect lions for\r\nhealth and vigor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA NEW PORTRAIT OF CICERO.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the third volume of his _History of the Romans under the Empire_, just\r\npublished in London, Mr. MERIVALE gives some elaborate pieces of character\r\nwriting, one of which has for its subject CICERO. It is not good for a man\r\nto think harshly of Cicero, and however easy it may seem to be to condemn\r\nmanifest faults in his character, it is by no means easy to be fair in the\r\nestimate we make. Mr. Merivale sums up a character which has too often\r\nbeen roughly put down as that of a great writer and a little man, as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"Many writers, it has been remarked, have related the death of\r\n    Cicero, but Plutarch alone has painted it. In the narrative here\r\n    laid before him the reader has the substance of this picturesque\r\n    account, together with some touches introduced from collateral\r\n    sources. In this, as in many other massages of his Lives, the\r\n    Greek biographer has evidently aimed at creating an effect, and\r\n    though he seems to have been mainly guided by the genuine\r\n    narrative of Tiro, Cicero’s beloved freedman, we may suspect him\r\n    of having embellished it to furnish a striking termination to one\r\n    of his favorite sketches. Nevertheless the narrative is mainly\r\n    confirmed by a fragment of Livy’s history, which has fortunately\r\n    been preserved. The Roman author vies with the Greek in throwing\r\n    dignity and interest over the great statesman’s end. But in\r\n    reviewing the uneven tenor of his career, Livy concludes with the\r\n    stern comment, \"He bore none of his calamities as a man should,\r\n    except his death.\" These are grave words. In the mouth of one who\r\n    had cast his scrutinizing glance over the characters and exploits\r\n    of all the heroes of the great republic, and had learnt by the\r\n    training of his life-long studies to discriminate moral qualities\r\n    and estimate desert, they constitute the most important judgment\r\n    on the conduct of Cicero that antiquity has bequeathed to us. Few\r\n    indeed among the Romans ever betrayed a want of resolution in the\r\n    face of impending death. But it was in the endurance of calamity\r\n    rather than the defiance of danger that the courage of Cicero was\r\n    deficient. The orator, whose genius lay in the arts of peace and\r\n    persuasion, exhibited on more than one occasion a martial spirit\r\n    worthy of other habits and a ruder training. In the contest with\r\n    Catilina he displayed all the moral confidence of a veteran\r\n    general: in the struggle with Antonius he threw himself without\r\n    reserve into a position where there was no alternative but to\r\n    conquer or to perish. In the earlier conflict he had still his\r\n    fame to acquire, his proud ascendency to establish; and the love\r\n    of praise and glory inspired him with the audacity which makes and\r\n    justifies its own success. But in the later, he courted danger for\r\n    the sake of retaining the fame he so dearly prized. He had once\r\n    saved his country, and he could not endure that it should be said\r\n    he had ever deserted it. He loved his country; but it wan for his\r\n    own honor, which he could preserve, rather than for his country’s\r\n    freedom, which he despaired of, that he returned to his post when\r\n    escape was still possible. He might have remained silent, but he\r\n    opened the floodgates of his eloquence. When indeed he had once\r\n    launched himself on the torrent he lost all self-command; he could\r\n    neither retrace nor moderate his career; he saw the rocks before\r\n    him, but he dashed himself headlong against them. But another\r\n    grave authority has given us the judgment of antiquity, that\r\n    Cicero’s defect was the want of steadfastness. His courage had no\r\n    dignity because it lacked consistency. All men and all parties\r\n    agreed that he could not be relied upon to lead, to co-operate, or\r\n    to follow. In all the great enterprises of his party, he was left\r\n    behind, except that which the nobles undertook against Catilina,\r\n    in which they rather thrust him before them than engaged with him\r\n    on terms of mutual support. When we read the vehement claims which\r\n    Cicero put forth to the honor of association, however tardy, with\r\n    the glories and dangers of Cæsar’s assassins, we should deem the\r\n    conspirators guilty of a monstrous oversight in having neglected\r\n    to enlist him in their design, were we not assured that he was not\r\n    to be trusted as a confederate either for good or for evil.\r\n\r\n    \"Of all the characters of antiquity Cicero is undoubtedly that\r\n    with which we are most intimately acquainted; for he alone has\r\n    left to us the record of his thoughts and actions for more than\r\n    half his public career in a voluminous mass of familiar as well as\r\n    political correspondence. No public character probably could pass\r\n    unscathed through the fiery ordeal to which he has thus subjected\r\n    himself. Cicero, it must be avowed, is convicted from his own\r\n    mouth of vanity, inconstancy, sordidness, jealousy, malice,\r\n    selfishness, and timidity. But on the other hand no character,\r\n    public or private, could thus bare its workings to our view\r\n    without laying a stronger claim to our sympathy, and extorting\r\n    from us more kindly consideration than we can give to the mere\r\n    shell of the human being with which ordinary history brings us in\r\n    contact. Cicero gains more than he loses by the confessions he\r\n    pours into our ear. We read in his letters what we should vainly\r\n    search for in the meagre pages of Sallust and Appian, in the\r\n    captious criticism of Dion, and even in the pleasant anecdotes of\r\n    his friendly biographer Plutarch, his amiableness, his refined\r\n    urbanity, his admiration for excellence, his thirst for fame, his\r\n    love of truth, equity, and reason. Much indeed of the patriotism,\r\n    the honesty, the moral courage he exhibited, was really no other\r\n    than the refined ambition of attaining the respect of his\r\n    contemporaries and bequeathing a name to posterity. He might not\r\n    act from a sense of duty, like Cato, but his motives, personal and\r\n    selfish as they in some sense were, coincided with what a more\r\n    enlightened conscience would have felt to be duty. Thus his\r\n    proconsulate is perhaps the purest and most honorable passage in\r\n    his life. His strict and rare probity amidst the temptations of\r\n    office arrests our attention and extorts our praise: yet assuredly\r\n    Cicero had no nice sense of honor, and was controlled by no\r\n    delicacy of sentiment, where public opinion was silent, or a\r\n    transaction strictly private. His courting his ward Publilia for\r\n    her dower, his caressing Dolabella for the sake of getting his\r\n    debt paid, his soliciting the historian Lucceius to color and\r\n    exaggerate the merits of his consulship, display a grievous want\r\n    of magnanimity and of a predominant sense of right. Fortunately\r\n    his instinct taught him to see in the constitution of the republic\r\n    the fairest field for the display of his peculiar talents; the\r\n    orator and the pleader could not fail to love the arena on which\r\n    the greatest triumph of his genius had been or were yet, as he\r\n    hoped, to be acquired. And Cicero indeed was not less ambitious\r\n    than Cæesar or Pompeius, Antonius or Octavius. To the pursuit of\r\n    fame he sacrificed many interests and friendships. He was not less\r\n    jealous of a rival in his chosen career than any of the leaders of\r\n    party and candidates for popular favor. He could not endure\r\n    competition for the throne of eloquence and the sceptre of\r\n    persuasion. It was on this account perhaps that he sought his\r\n    associates among the young, from whose rivalry he had nothing to\r\n    fear, rather than from his own contemporaries, the candidates for\r\n    the same prize of public admiration which he aimed at securing for\r\n    himself. From his pages there flows an incessant stream of abuse\r\n    of all the great masters of political power in his time; of Cæsar\r\n    and Pompeius; of Crassus and Antonius, not to mention his coarse\r\n    vituperation of Piso and Gabinius, and his uneasy sneers at the\r\n    impracticable Cato. We may note the different tone which his\r\n    disparagement assumes towards these men respectively. He speaks of\r\n    Cæsar with awe, of Pompeius with mortification, with dislike of\r\n    Crassus, with bitter malice of Antonius. Cæsar, even when he most\r\n    deeply reprobates him, he personally loves; the cold distrust of\r\n    Pompeius vexes his self-esteem; between him and Crassus there\r\n    subsists a natural antipathy of temperament: but Antonius, the\r\n    hate of his old age, becomes to him the incarnation of all the\r\n    evil his long and bitter experience of mankind have discovered in\r\n    the human heart. While we suspect Cicero of injustice towards the\r\n    great men of his day, we are bound also to specify the gross\r\n    dishonesty with which he magnifies his own merits where they are\r\n    trivial, and embellishes them where they are really important. The\r\n    perpetual recurrence to the topic of his own political deserts\r\n    must have wearied the most patient of friends, and more than\r\n    balanced the display of sordidness and time-serving which Atticus\r\n    doubtless reflected back in his share of the correspondence\r\n    between them.\r\n\r\n    \"But while Cicero stands justly charged with many grave\r\n    infirmities of temper and defects of principle, while we remark\r\n    with a sigh the vanity, the inconstancy, and the ingratitude he so\r\n    often manifested, while we lament his ignoble subserviencies and\r\n    his ferocious resentments, the high standard by which we claim to\r\n    judge him is in itself the fullest acknowledgment of his\r\n    transcendent merits. For undoubtedly had he not placed himself on\r\n    a higher moral level than the statesmen and sages of his day, we\r\n    should pass over many of his weaknesses in silence, and allow his\r\n    pretensions to our esteem to pass almost unchallenged. But we\r\n    demand a nearer approach to the perfection of human wisdom and\r\n    virtue in one who sought to approve himself the greatest of their\r\n    teachers. Nor need we scruple to admit that the judgment of the\r\n    ancients on Cicero was for the most part unfavorable. The\r\n    moralists of antiquity required in their heroes virtues with which\r\n    we can more readily dispense: and they too had less sympathy with\r\n    many qualities which a purer religion and a wider experience have\r\n    taught us to love and admire. Nor were they capable, from their\r\n    position, of estimating the slow and silent effects upon human\r\n    happiness of the lessons which Cicero enforced. After all the\r\n    severe judgments we are compelled to pass on his conduct, we must\r\n    acknowledge that there remains a residue of what is amiable in his\r\n    character and noble in his teaching beyond all ancient example.\r\n    Cicero lived and died in faith. He has made converts to the belief\r\n    in virtue, and had disciples in the wisdom of love. There have\r\n    been dark periods in the history of man, when the feeble ray of\r\n    religious instruction paled before the torch of his generous\r\n    philanthropy. The praise which the great critic pronounced upon\r\n    his excellence in oratory may be justly extended to the qualities\r\n    of his heart, and even in our enlightened days it may be held no\r\n    mean advance in virtue to venerate the master of Roman\r\n    philosophy.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLORD MAHON’S HISTORY OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nIncomparably the best history of our struggle for independence that has\r\nbeen written by a foreigner is that of which we have the larger portion in\r\nthe just-published fifth and sixth volumes of Lord MAHON’S _History of\r\nEngland from the Peace of Utrecht_, comprising the period from 1763 to\r\n1780—from the commencement of the popular discontents until the virtual\r\nconclusion of the war.\r\n\r\nThe character of Lord Mahon as a historian has long been established. When\r\nSismondi, in 1842, had brought his History of France down to the peace of\r\nAix-la-Chapelle, he lamented that he could no longer be guided by Lord\r\nMahon, and expressed a hope that his \"brilliant labors\" would be\r\ncontinued. The portion of his work on which the illustrious Frenchman thus\r\nset the seal of his approval has been reprinted in this country by the\r\nAppletons, in two large volumes (embracing the first four of the original\r\nimpression), carefully and judiciously edited by Professor Henry Reed, of\r\nPhiladelphia. It well indicates the right of its author to a place with\r\nthe best British writers in this department. History was never before\r\nwritten so brilliantly or profoundly as in the last half century. Germany\r\nin this period has boasted her Schiller, Niebuhr, Von Hammer, Heeren,\r\nRanke, and two Mullers; France her Sismondi, Barrante, Thierrys, Michelet,\r\nMignet, Guizot, and Thiers; England her Mitford, Arnold, Thirlwall, Grote,\r\nNapier, Hallam, Mackintosh, Macaulay, Palgrave, and Mahon; and we have\r\nourselves the noble names of Bancroft, Prescott, and Irving, to send to\r\nthe next ages. Of the English authors we have mentioned, we regard Lord\r\nMahon as in many respects the first; Hallam is a laborious and wise\r\ncritic; Thirlwall and Grote, in their province, have greatly increased the\r\nfame of British scholarship; and Macaulay, brilliant and picturesque\r\nbeyond any of his contemporaries, has an unprecedented popularity, which\r\nwill last until the worthlessness of his opinions and the viciousness of\r\nhis style are more justly appreciated than they are likely to be by the\r\nmobs of novel readers who in this generation have preferred him to James\r\nand Ainsworth. Lord Mahon is the most legitimate successor of the greatest\r\nhistorian of his country, David Hume.\r\n\r\nAlthough the chief subject of these new volumes is the American war, the\r\ngeneral political history of England, from the decline of the fortunes of\r\nBute through the administration of Grenville, Rockingham, Chatham, the\r\nDuke of Grafton, and Lord North, is illustrated and commented on as\r\nlargely as the special purpose of the author permitted; and we have many\r\nstriking passages respecting Wilkes and his various persecutions, the\r\nLetters of Junius and their authorship, and the common intellectual and\r\nmaterial progress of the British empire. The spirit in which he regards\r\nour Revolution is illustrated by the following paragraph, on the\r\nrejection, by the House of Peers, of the conciliatory Bill by which Lord\r\nChatham hoped, in 1775, to prevent the threatened separation of the\r\ncolonies:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"It may be proper, or at least pardonable, here to pause for an\r\n    inquiry, what probable issue might have attended an opposite\r\n    decision in the British Parliament? If the ministers had been\r\n    defeated on this Bill, if, in consequence, they had resigned, and\r\n    it had in other hands been carried through, would the Americans\r\n    have accepted the measure cheerfully and readily—would it for a\r\n    long time to come have closed the breach, and cemented the union\r\n    with the Mother Country? From all the facts and testimonies then\r\n    or since made public, I answer without hesitation that it would.\r\n    The sword was then slumbering in its scabbard. On both sides there\r\n    were injuries to redress, but not as yet bloodshed to avenge. It\r\n    was only a quarrel. It was not as yet a war. Even the boldest\r\n    leaders of that war in after years, whether in council or the\r\n    field, were still, in January, 1775, the firm friends of colonial\r\n    subordination. Washington himself (and he at least was no\r\n    dissembler—from him, at least, there never came any promise or\r\n    assurance that did not deserve the most implicit credit) had only\r\n    a few months before presided at a meeting of Fairfax County, in\r\n    Virginia. That meeting, while claiming relief of grievances, had\r\n    also at his instance adopted the following Resolve:—’That it is\r\n    our greatest wish and inclination, as well as interest, to\r\n    continue our connection with, and dependence upon, the British\r\n    Government.’ But further still, although the first Congress was\r\n    praised by Chatham for its moderate counsels, and although the\r\n    calmer voice of history has ratified the praise, we learn that\r\n    these moderate counsels did not lag behind, but rather exceeded\r\n    and outran the prevailing sentiment in many of the colonies. To\r\n    this fact we find an unimpeachable testimony in the letters of\r\n    President Reed, who, writing to a friend in strict confidence,\r\n    laments that ’The proceedings of Congress have been pitched on too\r\n    high a key for some of those middle provinces.’ With such\r\n    feelings, how gladly, how gratefully would they have welcomed the\r\n    hand of reconciliation stretched out by the Parliament of England!\r\n    It may be true, indeed, that such feelings as these did not\r\n    prevail in all, or nearly all, the colonies. It may be true,\r\n    especially, that no amount of good government, of forbearance, or\r\n    of kindness, would have won back Massachusetts. But herein lay, as\r\n    I think, the especial force and efficacy of Lord Chatham’s scheme,\r\n    that it did not refer the questions of parliamentary supremacy and\r\n    colonial taxation to the decision of any one province; but, as the\r\n    Americans themselves desired, to the decision of a Congress\r\n    composed from all the provinces, so that disaffection, however\r\n    firmly rooted here and there, would of course be overpowered by a\r\n    loyal and large majority. Nor do I believe that the proposal of a\r\n    new grant to the Crown, and the consequent necessity of increased\r\n    taxation to the people, would have interposed any serious\r\n    obstacle. The load of taxation on the colonies was at this period\r\n    light indeed: according to a calculation made by Lord North in\r\n    that very year, each inhabitant of England paid in taxes, upon an\r\n    average, not less than twenty-five shillings annually; but each\r\n    inhabitant of British America no more than sixpence. The\r\n    experience of the closely-following Revolutionary war proves how\r\n    easily and readily, when their feelings were involved, the\r\n    Americans could raise far greater supplies. And surely had Lord\r\n    Chatham’s scheme prevailed, their feelings would have been\r\n    involved. They would have been pleased and proud to show that\r\n    their previous refusal to pay taxes sprang from principle, and not\r\n    from inability or disaffection; and that, when once their views of\r\n    principle had been complied with, they could contribute with no\r\n    sparing hand to the exigencies of their countrymen, and to the\r\n    service of their king.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe opinion of Lord Mahon that, even after Burgoyne’s surrender, and the\r\ntreaty of alliance between France and America, the colonies might have\r\nbeen preserved, had Lord Chatham lived and returned to office, we think\r\nentirely erroneous. Our separation from England, though there had been no\r\nstamp act or tea tax, was inevitable.\r\n\r\nLord Mahon is exceedingly fond of personal portraiture, in which he is\r\nsometimes very successful. One of his most carefully-elaborated\r\nperformances in this way has for its subject Washington, and in the dozen\r\npages he devotes to the analysis of the character of the great chief he\r\nhas displayed his best abilities, though, we confess, without suggesting\r\nany thing very novel. He dislikes Franklin, and loses no opportunity of\r\nimputing to him personal dishonesty. We think the influence of Mr. William\r\nB. Reed’s Life of President Reed is traceable in almost every allusion\r\nmade by Lord Mahon to our philosopher. Without further observation upon\r\nthe qualities of the work, we avail ourselves of the possession of an\r\nearly copy of it to present our readers with some of the most striking\r\npassages pencilled in a hasty reading.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n    During many years did Washington continue to enjoy the pleasures\r\n    and fulfil the duties of an independent country gentleman.\r\n    Field-sports divided his time with the cultivation and improvement\r\n    of his land, and the sales of his tobacco; he showed kindness to\r\n    his dependents, and hospitality to his friends; and having been\r\n    elected one of the House of Burgesses in Virginia, he was,\r\n    whenever that House met, exact in his attendance. To that\r\n    well-regulated mind nothing within the course of its ordinary and\r\n    appointed avocations seemed unworthy of its care. His ledgers and\r\n    day-books were kept by himself: he took note of all the houses\r\n    where he partook of hospitality, so that not even the smallest\r\n    courtesies might pass by unremembered; and until his press of\r\n    business in the Revolutionary War he was wont every evening to set\r\n    down the variations of the weather during the preceding day. It\r\n    was also his habit through life, whenever he wished to possess\r\n    himself perfectly of the contents of any paper, to transcribe it\r\n    in his own hand, and apparently with deliberation, so that no\r\n    point might escape his notice. Many copies of this kind were after\r\n    his death found among his manuscripts.\r\n\r\n    We may observe, however, that in the mind of Washington\r\n    punctuality and precision did not, as we often find them, turn in\r\n    any degree to selfishness. On the contrary, he was rather careless\r\n    of small points where only his own comfort was concerned. Thus he\r\n    could seldom be persuaded to take any remedy, or desist from any\r\n    business, whenever he caught a cold, but used to say, \"let it go\r\n    as it came!\"\r\n\r\n    Nor yet was his constant regularity of habits attended by undue\r\n    formality of manner. In one of his most private letters there\r\n    appears given incidentally, and as it were by chance, a golden\r\n    rule upon that subject:—\"As to the gentlemen you mention I cannot\r\n    charge myself with incivility, or what in my opinion is\r\n    tantamount, ceremonious civility.\r\n\r\n    In figure Washington was thin and tall (above six feet high), in\r\n    countenance grave, unimpassioned, and benign. An inborn worth, an\r\n    unaffected dignity, beamed forth in every look as in every word\r\n    and deed. His first appearance and address might not convey the\r\n    idea of superior talents; such at least was the remark of his\r\n    accomplished countryman, Mr. Gallatin; but no man, whether friend\r\n    or enemy, ever viewed without respect the noble simplicity of his\r\n    demeanor, the utter absence in him of every artifice and every\r\n    affectation.\r\n\r\n    It has been justly remarked that of General Washington there are\r\n    fewer anecdotes to tell than perhaps of any other great man on\r\n    record. So equally framed were the features of his mind, so\r\n    harmonious all its proportions, that no one quality rose salient\r\n    above the rest. There were none of those chequered ques, none of\r\n    those warring emotions, in which Biography delights. There was no\r\n    contrast of lights and shades, no flickering of the flame; it was\r\n    a mild light that seldom dazzled, but that ever cheered and\r\n    warmed. His contemporaries or his close observers, as Mr.\r\n    Jefferson and Mr. Gallatin, assert that he had naturally strong\r\n    passions, but had attained complete mastery over them. In\r\n    self-control indeed he has never been surpassed. If sometimes on\r\n    rare occasions, and on strong provocation, there was wrung from\r\n    him a burst of anger, it was almost instantly quelled by the\r\n    dominion of his will. He decided surely, though he deliberated\r\n    slowly; nor could any urgency or peril move him from his serene\r\n    composure, his calm and clear-headed good sense. Integrity and\r\n    truth were also ever present in his mind. Not a single instance,\r\n    as I believe, can be found in his whole career when he was\r\n    impelled by any but an upright motive, or endeavored to attain an\r\n    object by any but worthy means. Such are some of the high\r\n    qualities which have justly earned for General Washington the\r\n    admiration even of the country he opposed, and not merely the\r\n    admiration but the gratitude and affection of his own. Such was\r\n    the pure and upright spirit to which, when its toils were over and\r\n    its earthly course had been run, was offered the unanimous homage\r\n    of the assembled Congress, all clad in deep mourning for their\r\n    common loss, as to \"the man first in war, first in peace, and\r\n    first in the hearts of his fellow-citizens.\" At this day in the\r\n    United States the reverence for his character is, as it should be,\r\n    deep and universal, and not confined, as with nearly all our\r\n    English statesmen, to one party, one province, or one creed. Such\r\n    reverence for Washington is felt even by those who wander furthest\r\n    from the paths in which he trod. A President when recommending\r\n    measures of aggression and invasion can still refer to him whose\r\n    rule was ever to arm only in self-defence as to \"the greatest and\r\n    best of men!\" States which exult in their bankruptcy as a proof of\r\n    their superior shrewdness, and have devised \"Repudiation\" as a\r\n    newer and more graceful term for it, yet look up to their great\r\n    General—the very soul of good faith and honor—with their reverence\r\n    unimpaired!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                              PATRICK HENRY.\r\n\r\n    The colony of Virginia was the place, and the the year 1736 the\r\n    time, of birth to Patrick Henry. His parents were in easy\r\n    circumstances, but burthened with a numerous family; they resided\r\n    at a country scat to which the ambitious name of Mount Brilliant\r\n    had been given. In childhood Patrick Henry gave little promise of\r\n    distinction. His person is represented as having been coarse, his\r\n    manners extremely awkward, his dress slovenly, and his aversion to\r\n    study invincible. No persuasion could bring him either to read or\r\n    to work. At sixteen his father gave him means to open a small\r\n    shop, which failed, however, in less than one year. Then he tried\r\n    a small farm, and married; then again he entered upon the life of\r\n    a tradesman, but in a few years more was a bankrupt. It was at\r\n    this period that he became acquainted with Mr. Jefferson,\r\n    afterwards President of the United States. \"Mr. Henry,\" says\r\n    Jefferson, \"had a little before broken up his store (shop), or\r\n    rather it had broken him up, but his misfortunes were not to be\r\n    traced either in his countenance or conduct. His manners had\r\n    something of coarseness in them; his passion was music, dancing,\r\n    and pleasantry. He excelled in the last, and it attached every one\r\n    to him.\"\r\n\r\n    As a last resource, Patrick Henry now determined to make a trial\r\n    of the law. It cannot be said that his preparatory studies were\r\n    unduly arduous, since, as his biographer informs us, they were all\r\n    comprised in the period of six weeks. Under such unpromising\r\n    circumstances, and in the year 1763, he obtained a brief in the\r\n    long-contested cause then raging in Virginia between the clergy on\r\n    the one side, and the legislature on the other, as regarding the\r\n    stipends which the former claimed. On this occasion Henry, to the\r\n    astonishment of all who knew him, poured forth a strain of such\r\n    impassioned eloquence as not only carried the cause, contrary to\r\n    all previous expectation, but placed him ever afterwards at the\r\n    head of his profession in the colony. To this very day, says Mr.\r\n    Wirt, writing in 1818, the impression remains, and the old people\r\n    of that district think that no higher compliment can be paid to\r\n    any public speaker than to say of him in their homely phrase, \"He\r\n    is almost equal to Patrick when he plead (pleaded) against the\r\n    parsons!\"\r\n\r\n    The natural eloquence which on this occasion flashed forth from\r\n    the coarse and unlettered Henry, as the spark-of fire from the\r\n    flint, continued to distinguished him both as a Member of the\r\n    House of Burgesses at Williamsburg, and afterwards as a member of\r\n    Congress. He took from the first a bold and active part against\r\n    the pretensions of the mother country; indeed Mr. Jefferson goes\r\n    so far as to declare that \"Mr. Henry certainly gave the earliest\r\n    impulse to the ball of revolution.\" His most celebrated burst of\r\n    oratory, or rather turn of phrase, was in this very year 1765,\r\n    when descanting in the House of Burgesses on the tyranny of the\r\n    Stamp Act. \"Cæsar—\" he cried, in a voice of thunder and with an\r\n    eye of fire—\"Cæsar had his Brutus—Charles the First had his\r\n    Cromwell—and George the Third\"—\"Treason!\" here exclaimed the\r\n    Speaker, \"Treason! Treason!\" re-echoed from every part of the\r\n    House. Henry did not for an instant falter, but fixing his eye\r\n    firmly on the Speaker, he concluded his sentence thus \"—may profit\r\n    by their example. If this be treason make the most of it!\"\r\n\r\n    Indolence and aversion to reading seemed almost as natural to\r\n    Henry’s mind as powers of debate. To the last he never overcame\r\n    them. Thus, at his death, in 1799, his books were found to be\r\n    extremely few, and these too consisting chiefly of odd volumes.\r\n    But his gift of speech was (for his hearers) sufficiently\r\n    supported by his fiery energy, his practical shrewdness, and his\r\n    ever keen glance into the feelings and characters of other. Nor\r\n    were these his only claims to his country’s favor. He retained the\r\n    manners and custom of the common people, with what his friendly\r\n    biographer terms \"religious caution.—He dressed as plainly as the\r\n    plainest of them,\" continues Mr. Wirt, \"ate only their homely\r\n    fare, and drank their simple beverage, mixed with them on a\r\n    footing of the most entire and perfect equality, and conversed\r\n    with them even in their own vicious and depraved pronunciation.\"\r\n    By such means he soon acquired and long retained a large measure\r\n    of popularity, and he applied himself with zeal and success before\r\n    any audience, and on every occasion which arose, to increase and\r\n    perpetuate the estrangement between the North American Colonies\r\n    and England.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                FRANKLIN.\r\n\r\n    Dr. Benjamin Franklin is one of those men who have made the task\r\n    of succeeding biographers more difficult by having been in part\r\n    their own. He was born at Boston in 1706, the youngest of ten\r\n    sons. \"My father,\" he says, \"intended to devote me, as the tithe\r\n    of his sons, to the service of the Church;\" but on further\r\n    reflection, the charges of a college education were thought too\r\n    burthensome, and young Benjamin became a journeyman printer. From\r\n    a very early age he showed a passionate fondness for reading, and\r\n    much ingenuity in argument, but, as he acknowledges, had at first\r\n    contracted a disputatious and wrangling turn of conversation. \"I\r\n    have since observed,\" he says, \"that persons of good sense seldom\r\n    fall into it, except lawyers, University-men, and generally men of\r\n    all sorts who have been bred at Edinburgh.\"\r\n\r\n    Young Franklin was at first bound apprentice to one of his elder\r\n    brothers, a printer at Boston; but some differences arising\r\n    between them, he proceeded to Philadelphia, where he soon obtained\r\n    employment, and ere long set up for himself. His success in life\r\n    was secured by his great frugality, industry, and shrewdness. In\r\n    his own words: \"I spent no time in taverns, games, or frolics of\r\n    any kind; reading was the only amusement I allowed myself.\" His\r\n    knowledge and shrewdness,—great zeal in urging any improvements,\r\n    and great ingenuity in promoting them,—speedily raised him high in\r\n    the estimation of his fellow-townsmen, and enabled him to take a\r\n    forward part in all the affairs of his province. In England, and\r\n    indeed all Europe, he became celebrated by his experiments and\r\n    discoveries in electricity. These may deserve the greater credit\r\n    when we recollect both their practical utility and their\r\n    unassisted progress,—how much the pointed rods which he introduced\r\n    have tended to avert the dangers of lightning, and how far removed\r\n    was Franklin at the time from all scientific society, libraries,\r\n    or patronage.\r\n\r\n    It has also been stated by no less an authority in science than\r\n    Sir Humphrey Davy, that \"the style and manner of Dr. Franklin’s\r\n    publication on Electricity are almost as worthy of admiration as\r\n    the doctrine it contains.\" The same remark may indeed be applied\r\n    to all his writings. All of them are justly celebrated for their\r\n    clear, plain, and lively style, free from every appearance of art,\r\n    but, in fact, carefully pointed and nicely poised. In public\r\n    speaking, on the other hand, he was much less eminent. His last\r\n    American biographer observes of him, that he never even pretended\r\n    to the accomplishments of an orator or debater. He seldom spoke in\r\n    a deliberative assembly, except for some special object, and then\r\n    only for a few minutes at a time.\r\n\r\n    As a slight instance of Franklin’s humor and shrewdness in all\r\n    affairs of common life I may quote the following: \"QUESTION. I am\r\n    about courting a girl I have had but little acquaintance with. How\r\n    shall I come to a knowledge of her faults? ANSWER. Commend her\r\n    among her female acquaintance!\"\r\n\r\n    Whether in science and study, or in politics and action, the great\r\n    aim of Franklin’s mind was ever practical utility. Here again we\r\n    may quote Sir Humphrey Davy as saying of Franklin that he sought\r\n    rather to make philosophy a useful inmate and servant in the\r\n    common habitations of man, than to preserve her merely as an\r\n    object of admiration in temples and palaces. Thus, also, in\r\n    affairs he had a keen eye to his own interest, but likewise a\r\n    benevolent concern for the public good. Nor was he ever\r\n    indifferent to cases of individual grievance or hardship. In the\r\n    pursuit of his objects, public or private, he was, beyond most\r\n    other men, calm, sagacious, and wary; neither above business nor\r\n    yet below it; never turned aside from it by flights of fancy nor\r\n    yet by bursts of passion.\r\n\r\n    Among the good qualities which we may with just cause ascribe to\r\n    Franklin we cannot number any firm reliance on the truths of\r\n    Revelation. Only five weeks before his death we find him express a\r\n    cold approbation of the \"system of morals\" bequeathed to us by\r\n    \"Jesus of Nazareth.\" In his Memoirs he declares that he always\r\n    believed in the existence of a Deity and a future state of rewards\r\n    and punishments, but he adds that although he continued to adhere\r\n    to his first—the Presbyterian—sect, some of its dogmas appeared to\r\n    him unintelligible, and others doubtful. \"I early absented myself\r\n    from the public assemblies of the sect; and I seldom attended any\r\n    public worship; Sunday being my studying day.\"\r\n\r\n    Such being Franklin’s own practice, and such his own description\r\n    of it as to public worship, it seems worthy of note that it was he\r\n    who in the American Convention brought forward a motion for daily\r\n    prayers. \"I have lived, Sir,\" said he, \"a long time, and the\r\n    longer I live the more convincing proofs I see of this truth, that\r\n    God governs in the affairs of men. And if a sparrow cannot fall to\r\n    the ground without his notice, is it probable that an empire can\r\n    rise without his aid?\" But in spite of this most earnest appeal\r\n    the motion was rejected, since, as we are told, \"the Convention,\r\n    except three or four persons, thought prayers unnecessary.\"\r\n\r\n    The accomplished American biographer, by whom this last incident\r\n    is recorded, expresses in the same passage deep regret that Dr.\r\n    Franklin did not bestow more attention than he seems to have done\r\n    on the evidences of Christianity. And indeed there are several\r\n    indications that he was less well acquainted with points of\r\n    Christian faith and discipline than with almost any other subject.\r\n    One of these indications, and surely a most strange one, occurs in\r\n    the Private Diary which he kept at Passy during part of 1784. It\r\n    appears that two young American gentlemen had come over to London\r\n    with the view of entering Holy Orders, but that the Archbishop of\r\n    Canterbury refused them Ordination unless they would take the Oath\r\n    of Allegiance. In this dilemma Franklin actually applied to the\r\n    Pope’s Nuncio at Paris to ascertain whether a Roman Catholic\r\n    Bishop in America might not perform the ceremony for them as\r\n    Protestants, and he transcribes as remarkable the natural reply:\r\n    \"The Nuncio says the thing is impossible unless the gentlemen\r\n    become Roman Catholics.\"\r\n\r\n    The religious scepticism or indifference of Franklin, which his\r\n    present biographers justly lament, was, however, in his own day, a\r\n    recommendation and a merit with the French philosophists. On the\r\n    other hand, his hostility to England endeared him to the French\r\n    politicians. On both these grounds, as well as from his high\r\n    scientific attainments, he found himself during his residence of\r\n    several years at Paris in no common measure courted, flattered,\r\n    and caressed. A fine verse, one of the noblest which modern\r\n    Latinity can boast, describes him as having plucked the lightning\r\n    from Heaven and the sceptre from tyrants.\r\n\r\n    Descending from such lofty flights to the regions of sober\r\n    reality, we may observe that Franklin in his later years, and\r\n    especially in France, adopted to a great extent the Quaker garb.\r\n    He laid aside the huge wig which he used to wear in England, and\r\n    allowed his long white hair to flow down nearly to his shoulders.\r\n    His clothes were of the plainest cut and of the dunnest color. The\r\n    Parisians of that period, ever swayed by external impressions,\r\n    were greatly struck with, and in their writings frequently refer\r\n    to, his venerable aspect, and they compared him by turns to all\r\n    the sages of antiquity. It is also probable that his Quaker-like\r\n    attire may have tended to invest him in their estimation with the\r\n    other attributes which they assigned to the ideal Quaker\r\n    character, as simplicity, guilelessness, inviolable truth.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               LA FAYETTE.\r\n\r\n    It so chanced that in the summer of 1776, La Fayette, still in his\r\n    teens, and serving as a subaltern with the French army, was\r\n    stationed with his regiment at Metz. It happened also that in the\r\n    course of a foreign tour their Royal Highnesses of Gloucester\r\n    passed a few days in that town. The principal officers entertained\r\n    the Duke at dinner, when the conversation turned to the last news\r\n    from Philadelphia and the new Declaration of Independence. Being\r\n    at that period offended with his Court, from its neglect of the\r\n    Duchess, the Duke indulged in Opposition topics, and, in some\r\n    degree at least, took the part of the Americans. The details were\r\n    new to La Fayette. He listened with eagerness, and prolonged the\r\n    conversation by asking questions of the Royal guest. The cause of\r\n    the colonies that had risen against England seemed to him just and\r\n    noble, even on the showing of one of the English princes; and\r\n    before he left the table, the thought came into his head that he\r\n    would go to America, and offer the Americans his services. He\r\n    determined to return to Paris, and make further inquiries. His\r\n    inquiries being mainly addressed to Silas Deane and other zealous\r\n    friends of the insurgents, could not fail to confirm him in his\r\n    first impressions. He became fired with an ardent zeal for\r\n    Republican principles and the American cause. That zeal continued\r\n    ever afterwards—for well nigh sixty years—the polar star of his\r\n    course. That zeal, favored as it was by fortune, adapted to the\r\n    times that came upon him, and urged forward by great personal\r\n    vanity, laid the foundations of his fame far more, as I conceive,\r\n    than any strength of mind or talents of his own. Few men have ever\r\n    been so conspicuous from afar with so little, when closely viewed,\r\n    of real weight or dimension. As a general, it can scarcely be\r\n    pretended that his exploits were either many or considerable. As\r\n    an orator, we look in vain for any high powers of debate. As a\r\n    statesman, we find only an undistinguishing eagerness to apply the\r\n    Transatlantic examples and to act the part of Washington, without\r\n    duly estimating either the immense superiority of Washington’s\r\n    character above his own, or the manifold points of difference\r\n    between America and Europe.\r\n\r\n    It was said by Napoleon at St. Helena, that \"La Fayette was a man\r\n    of no ability, either in civil or military life; his understanding\r\n    was confined to narrow bounds; his character was full of\r\n    dissimulation, and swayed by vague ideas of liberty, which, in\r\n    him, were undefined and ill-digested.\" No doubt there is some\r\n    exaggeration in these words. No doubt the late Emperor, at that\r\n    period, was stirred by personal resentment at the hostile conduct\r\n    of the General in 1815; yet it will perhaps be found more easy by\r\n    any admirer of La Fayette to impugn the good faith of the\r\n    draughtsman than the general accuracy of the portrait.\r\n\r\n    The fortune of La Fayette was ample, his yearly income being\r\n    little short of two hundred thousand livres; and his connexions,\r\n    as we have seen, were among the first at Court. Under such\r\n    circumstances, Silas Deane felt the vast importance of securing\r\n    him. An agreement was concluded between them, by the intervention\r\n    of one Mr. Carmichael (for as yet La Fayette spoke no English, and\r\n    Deane little French), according to the terms of which the Marquis\r\n    de La Fayette was to join the American service, and to receive\r\n    from Congress the rank of Major-General—no slight temptation to a\r\n    stripling of nineteen! La Fayette was to be accompanied, or rather\r\n    attended, by the Baron de Kalb and eleven other officers of lower\r\n    rank, seeking service in America. He sent, in secret, an agent to\r\n    Bordeaux, there to purchase and prepare a vessel for their voyage.\r\n    Meanwhile he made an excursion of three weeks to London, where his\r\n    kinsman, the Marquis de Noailles, was ambassador. He was presented\r\n    to the King, and graciously received. He saw at the opera General\r\n    Clinton, who had come home on a winter leave of absence, and who\r\n    was next to meet him on a field of battle in America. But, mindful\r\n    of his own hostile designs, he deemed it proper to forbear from\r\n    prying into the military forces of the kingdom, and declined an\r\n    invitation to visit the naval armament at Portsmouth.\r\n\r\n    On his return to France, La Fayette bade farewell to his young\r\n    wife, leaving her four months gone with child, and set out for\r\n    Bordeaux. Thus far all had prospered according to his wishes. But\r\n    at Bordeaux he found that his preparations had been discovered and\r\n    complained of by Lord Stormont, and that a LETTRE DE CACHET for\r\n    his arrest was already issued. Nevertheless, he did not relinquish\r\n    his design. He crossed the Spanish frontier in the disguise of a\r\n    courier, found his vessel at Pasages, and there embarked with his\r\n    companions. Towards the middle of June he landed on the coast of\r\n    Carolina; and after a few days’ rest, pursued his route to\r\n    Philadelphia. His reception by the Congress was not at first a\r\n    warm one; but La Fayette declared that he would accept no pay, and\r\n    was willing to serve as a volunteer; and under these\r\n    circumstances, the Assembly fulfilled the terms of the secret\r\n    agreement, and bestowed on him the rank of Major-General.\r\n\r\n    At Philadelphia La Fayette saw the American troops for the first\r\n    time, and, according to his own account, was struck with their\r\n    grotesque appearance—with green boughs fastened to their\r\n    hats—coarse hunting-shirts instead of uniforms—and muskets, many\r\n    wanting bayonets, and all of unequal make and size. But he soon\r\n    learnt to think more favorably of these raw levies, when,\r\n    notwithstanding all their disadvantages, he observed their conduct\r\n    in the field. With regard to their commander, his early\r\n    impressions never changed. It was also at Philadelphia, and at a\r\n    dinner-table, comprising several members of the Congress, that La\r\n    Fayette was introduced to Washington. The boy-general found\r\n    himself warmly welcomed by the chief whom he had long admired.\r\n    \"When you come to the army,\" said Washington, \"I shall be pleased\r\n    if you will make my quarters your home, and consider yourself as\r\n    one of my family.\" The invitation thus frankly tendered was no\r\n    less frankly accepted. Thus did a cordial intimacy arise between\r\n    them, Washington at all times treating La Fayette with fatherly\r\n    kindness, and La Fayette looking up to Washington with filial\r\n    regard.\r\n\r\n    La Fayette had already begun to speak a little English, and by\r\n    degrees acquired more. But to the last the difficulties of the\r\n    language were a main obstacle, not only to himself, but to every\r\n    other foreigner who served with, or under, the United States. Thus\r\n    there are still preserved some of the ill-spelled and scarcely\r\n    intelligible notes of Count Pulasky, during the short time that he\r\n    served as general of cavalry. Still worse was the case of Baron\r\n    Steuben, a veteran of the school of Frederick the Second, who\r\n    joined the Americans a few months later than La Fayette, and who\r\n    greatly aided them in the establishment of discipline. The Baron,\r\n    it appears, could not teach and drill, nor even swear and curse,\r\n    but by means of an interpreter! He was, therefore, most fortunate\r\n    in securing as his aid-de-camp Captain Walker of New-York—most\r\n    fortunate, if, as his American biographer assures us, \"there was\r\n    not, perhaps, another officer in the army, unless Hamilton be\r\n    excepted, who could speak French and English so as to be well\r\n    understood in both.\"\r\n\r\n    La Fayette did not always confine himself to the bounds of his own\r\n    profession; sometimes, and, perhaps, not greatly to his credit, he\r\n    stepped beyond them. Here is one case recorded with much\r\n    satisfaction by himself. He states, that soon after his arrival in\r\n    America, and while attending on Sunday the service of the Church\r\n    of England, he was displeased with the clergyman, because in his\r\n    sermon he had said nothing at all of politics. \"I charged him to\r\n    his face,\" says La Fayette, \"with preaching only about Heaven!...\r\n    But next Sunday,\" continues the keen young officer, \"I heard him\r\n    again, when his loud invectives against ’the execrable House of\r\n    Hanover,’ showed that he was ready and willing to take my good\r\n    advice.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                            JOHN HORNE TOOKE.\r\n\r\n    His abilities were ill fitted for the profession of a clergyman,\r\n    which indeed he at last renounced, but they highly qualified him\r\n    for his favorite occupation as a demagogue. Between him and Wilkes\r\n    there now arose a violent animosity and a keen altercation carried\r\n    on in newspapers. Descending to the lowest and most selfish\r\n    details, they were not ashamed thus publicly to wrangle respecting\r\n    a Welsh pony and a hamper of claret! Even before the close of 1770\r\n    might be discerned the growing discord and weakness of Wilkes and\r\n    his city friends. At a meeting which they convened to consider\r\n    their course of action, some proposed a new Remonstrance to the\r\n    King, while others urged an impeachment of Lord North in the House\r\n    of Commons. \"What is the use of a new Remonstrance?\" cried Wilkes.\r\n    \"It would only serve to make another paper kite for His Royal\r\n    Highness the Prince of Wales!\"—\"What is the use of an\r\n    impeachment?\" cried Sawbridge. \"Lord North is quite sure of the\r\n    Bishops and the Scotch Peers in the Upper House, and could not\r\n    fail to be acquitted!\" But although these ardent patriots might\r\n    differ a little as to the means, they were bent on one and the\r\n    same end; and the Remonstrance which was at last agreed upon,\r\n    appears to have been framed by their united wisdom. As thus drawn\r\n    up it teemed with silly vagaries fit only to please the lowest\r\n    order of intellects. Thus it prayed that His Majesty would for\r\n    ever remove from his presence and councils all his Ministers and\r\n    Secretaries of State, especially Lord Mansfield (who by the way\r\n    was not one of them), and that His Majesty would not again admit\r\n    any Scotchman into the administration!\r\n\r\n\r\n                         THE CHARACTER OF WILKES.\r\n\r\n    He was born in 1727, the son of a rich distiller. Early in life he\r\n    set up a brewery for himself, but soon relinquished the wearisome\r\n    business. Early in life also he improved his fortune by his\r\n    marriage with the daughter and heiress of the celebrated Dr. Mead,\r\n    the author of the \"Treatise on Poisons.\" But this lady, being of\r\n    maturer age than himself, and of slight personal attractions, was\r\n    speedily slighted, and he left her with as much disgust as he had\r\n    his brewery. In 1757 he was elected Member of Parliament for\r\n    Aylesbury, but never obtained any success as an orator, his\r\n    speeches being, though flippant, yet feeble. In truth he had no\r\n    great ability of any kind, but dauntless courage and high animal\r\n    spirits. Nor should we deny him another much rarer praise,—a vein\r\n    of good humor and kindliness, which did not forsake him through\r\n    all his long career, amidst the riot of debauchery or the rancor\r\n    of faction. So agreeable and insinuating was his conversation,\r\n    that more than one fair dame as she listened found herself forget\r\n    his sinister squint and his ill-favored countenance. He used to\r\n    say of himself in a laughing strain, that though he was the\r\n    ugliest man in England, he wanted nothing to make him even with\r\n    the handsomest but half an hour at starting! Politics indeed\r\n    seemed at first wholly alien from Wilkes’s sphere; gayety and\r\n    gallantry were his peculiar objects. For some time he reigned the\r\n    oracle of green-rooms and the delight of taverns. In conjunction\r\n    with other kindred spirits, as Paul Whitehead and Sir Francis\r\n    Dashwood, amounting in all to twelve, he rented Medmenham Abbey,\r\n    near Marlow. It is a secluded and beautiful spot on the banks of\r\n    the Thames, with hanging woods that slope down to the crystal\r\n    stream, a grove of venerable elms, and meadows of the softest\r\n    green. In days of old it had been a convent of Cistercian monks,\r\n    but the new brotherhood took the title of Franciscans in\r\n    compliment to Sir Francis Dashwood, whom they called their Father\r\n    Abbot. On the portal, now again in ruins, and once more resigned\r\n    to its former solitude and silence, I could still a few years\r\n    since read the inscription placed there by Wilkes and his friends:\r\n    fay çe que voudras. Other French and Latin inscriptions, now with\r\n    good reason effaced, then appeared in other parts of the grounds,\r\n    some of them remarkable for wit, but all for either profaneness or\r\n    obscenity, and many the more highly applauded as combining both.\r\n    In this retreat the new Franciscans used often to meet for summer\r\n    pastimes, and varied the round of their debauchery by a mock\r\n    celebration of the principal Roman Catholic rites.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         WILKES’S ESSAY ON WOMAN.\r\n\r\n    It appears that Wilkes had, several years before, and in some of\r\n    his looser hours, composed a parody of Pope’s \"Essay on Man.\" In\r\n    this undertaking, which, according to his own account, cost him a\r\n    great deal of pains and time, he was, it is said, assisted by\r\n    Thomas Potter, second son of the late Archbishop of Canterbury,\r\n    who had been Secretary of Frederick Prince of Wales, and had since\r\n    shown ability and gained office in the House of Commons, but was\r\n    (as well became one of Wilkes’s friends) of lax morals in his\r\n    private life. The result of their joint authorship, however, has\r\n    little wit or talent to make any amends for the blasphemy and\r\n    lewdness with which it abounds. As the original had been inscribed\r\n    by Pope to Lord Bolingbroke, so was the parody by Wilkes to Lord\r\n    Sandwich; thus it began, \"Awake my Sandwich!\" instead of \"Awake my\r\n    St. John!\" Thus also, in ridicule of Warburton’s well-known\r\n    commentary, some burlesque notes were appended in the name of the\r\n    Right Reverend the Bishop of Gloucester.\r\n\r\n    This worthless poem had remained in manuscript, and lain in\r\n    Wilkes’s desk, until in the previous spring he had occasion to set\r\n    up a press at his own house, and was tempted to print fourteen\r\n    copies only as presents to his boon companions. Of one of these\r\n    copies the Government obtained possession, through a subordinate\r\n    agent, and by not very creditable means, and Lord Sandwich holding\r\n    it forth in his hand with the air of injured innocence, denounced\r\n    it as not only scandalous and impious, but also as a breach of\r\n    Privilege against the Bishop as a Peer of Parliament. He likewise\r\n    complained of another profane parody, written by the same hand,\r\n    and printed on the same occasion; this last was entitled, \"The\r\n    VENI CREATOR paraphrased.\" The most offensive passages of both\r\n    were now by Lord Sandwich’s order read aloud to the House, until\r\n    Lord Lyttleton with a groan entreated that they might hear no\r\n    more!\r\n\r\n    In the discussion which ensured, Bishop Warburton, forgetting that\r\n    such ribaldries could not really tarnish his character, showed a\r\n    heat which little became it. He exclaimed that the blackest fiends\r\n    in Hell would disdain to keep company with Wilkes,—and then asked\r\n    pardon of Satan for comparing them together! Both the Earl and\r\n    Bishop in their passion would have readily over-leaped the common\r\n    forms of justice. The former, after producing evidence at the Bar\r\n    as to the authorship of Wilkes, wished the House to take measures\r\n    for his prosecution, without the least delay. But the Peers,\r\n    although readily agreeing to vote the two parodies blasphemous and\r\n    breaches of Privilege, resolved, on the motion of Lord Mansfield,\r\n    to adjourn all further questions until the day after the next, so\r\n    as to give Wilkes the opportunity, if he desired it, of alleging\r\n    any matter in denial or defence.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              LORD THURLOW.\r\n\r\n    With all his faults and shortcomings there was that in Thurlow\r\n    which overawed and daunted his contemporaries, and of which the\r\n    impression is not wholly lost even on posterity. It was a saying\r\n    of Mr. Fox, that no man ever yet was so wise as Thurlow looked.\r\n    His countenance was fraught with sense; his aspect stately and\r\n    commanding; his brow broad, massy, and armed with terrors like\r\n    that of the Olympian Jove, to which indeed it was often compared.\r\n    His voice loud, sonorous, and as rolling thunder in the distance,\r\n    augmented the effect of his fierce and terrible invective. Few\r\n    indeed were they who did not quail before his frown; fewer still\r\n    who would abide his onset in debate. Perhaps no modern English\r\n    statesman, in the House of Lords at least, was ever so much\r\n    dreaded. In parliament, as at the bar, his speeches were home\r\n    thrusts, conveying the strongest arguments or keenest reproofs in\r\n    the plainest and clearest words. His enemies might accuse his\r\n    style of being coarse, and sometimes even ungrammatical, but they\r\n    could never deny its energy or its effect. In private life Thurlow\r\n    was remarkable for his thorough knowledge of the Greek and Latin\r\n    writers; and no less for his skill in argument and brilliant\r\n    powers of conversation. While yet at the bar, Dr. Johnson said of\r\n    him to Boswell: \"I honor Thurlow, sir; Thurlow is a fine fellow;\r\n    he fairly puts his mind to yours.\" And after he became Chancellor,\r\n    the same high authority added: \"I would prepare myself for no man\r\n    in England but Lord Thurlow. When I am to meet him, I should wish\r\n    to know a day before.\" Unless with ladies, his manner was always\r\n    uncouth, and his voice a constant growl. But beneath that rugged\r\n    rind there appears to have lurked much warmth of affection and\r\n    kindliness of heart. Many acts of generous aid and unsolicited\r\n    bounty are recorded of him. Men of learning and merit seldom\r\n    needed any other recommendation to his favor. Thus, on reading\r\n    Horsley’s \"Letters to Dr. Priestly,\" he at once obtained for the\r\n    author a stall at Gloucester, saying—what I earnestly wish all\r\n    other Chancellors had borne in mind—\"that those who supported the\r\n    Church should be supported by it.\" Nevertheless his temper, even\r\n    when in some measure sobered down by age, was always liable to\r\n    violent and unreasonable starts of passion. It is related by a\r\n    gentleman who dined with him at Brighton only a few months before\r\n    his death—for I must ever hold that great characters are best\r\n    portrayed by little circumstances—that a plateful of peaches being\r\n    brought in, the ex-Chancellor, incensed at their ill appearance,\r\n    ordered the window to be opened, and not only the peaches but the\r\n    whole desert to be thrown out!\r\n\r\n\r\n                              EDMUND BURKE.\r\n\r\n    In pamphlets, however, and political essays—and even speeches,\r\n    when revised and sent forth singly, may be comprehended in that\r\n    class,—the personal disadvantages of Burke could no longer apply;\r\n    and as regards that class of writings, it may be doubted whether\r\n    he has ever, in any age, or in any country, been excelled. The\r\n    philosophy and deep thought of his reflections—the vigor and\r\n    variety of his style—his rich flow of either panegyric or\r\n    invective—his fine touches of irony—the glowing abundance and\r\n    beauty of his metaphors—all these might separately claim applause;\r\n    how much more, then, when all blended into one glorious whole! To\r\n    give examples of these merits would be to transcribe half his\r\n    works. Yet still if one single and short instance from his maxims\r\n    be allowed me, I will observe that the generous ardor and activity\r\n    of mind called forth by competition has formed a theme of\r\n    philosophic comment from a very early age. It is touched both by\r\n    Cicero and Quintilian; it has not been neglected either by Bacon\r\n    or Montaigne. Yet still, as handled by Burke, this trite topic\r\n    beams forth, not only with the hues of eloquence, but even with\r\n    the bloom of novelty. He invites us to \"an amicable conflict with\r\n    difficulty. Difficulty is a severe instructor set over us by the\r\n    supreme ordinance of a parental guardian and legislator, who knows\r\n    us better than we know ourselves, as he loves us better too. He\r\n    that wrestles with us strengthens our nerves and sharpens our\r\n    skill. Our antagonist is our helper!\" If amidst so much of\r\n    eloquence and feeling as Burke’s writings display we are desired\r\n    to seek for faults, we shall find them, not in the want, but only\r\n    in the exuberance and overflow of beauties. The palate becomes\r\n    cloyed by so much richness, the eye dazzled by so much glare. His\r\n    metaphors, fraught with fancy though they be, are often bold; they\r\n    seem both too numerous and strained too far; they sometimes cease\r\n    to please, and occasionally border even on the ludicrous and low.\r\n    Of this defect, as of his excellences, a single instance shall\r\n    suffice me. In the \"Letter to a Noble Lord,\" in 1796, Burk\r\n    compares the Duke of Bedford to a lamb already marked for\r\n    slaughter by the Marats and Robespierres of France, but still\r\n    unconscious of his doom, \"pleased to the last,\" and who \"licks the\r\n    hand just raised to shed his blood.\" Thus far the simile is\r\n    conducted with admirable force and humor. But not satisfied with\r\n    his success, Burke goes further; he insists on leading us into the\r\n    shambles, and makes the revolutionary butchers inquire as to their\r\n    ducal victim, \"how he cuts up? how he tallows in the caul or on\r\n    the kidneys?\" Apart from the beauty of the style, the value, as I\r\n    conceive, of Burke’s writings, is subject to one not unimportant\r\n    deduction. For most lofty and far-sighted views in politics they\r\n    will never be consulted in vain. On the other hand, let no man\r\n    expect to find in them just or accurate, or even consistent,\r\n    delineations of contemporary character. Where eternal principles\r\n    are at stake, Burke was inaccessible to favor or to fear. Where\r\n    only persons are concerned, he was often misled by resentments or\r\n    by partialities, and allowed his fancy full play. The rich stores\r\n    of Burke’s memory and the rare powers of his mind were not\r\n    reserved solely for his speeches or his writings; they appeared to\r\n    no less advantage in his familiar conversation. Even the most\r\n    trivial topics could elicit, even the most ignorant hearers could\r\n    discern, his genius. \"Sir,\" said Dr. Johnson, \"if Burke were to go\r\n    into a stable to see his horse dressed, the hostler would say, We\r\n    have had an extraordinary man here!\" On other occasions, also, the\r\n    author of \"Rasselas\" extols him as \"never unwilling to begin\r\n    conversation, never at a loss to carry it on, never in haste to\r\n    leave it off.\" His attempts at wit, indeed, were not always\r\n    successful, and he might be accused of an inordinate affection for\r\n    quibbles and puns. His favorite niece, and latterly his guest, was\r\n    sometimes provoked into a—\"Really, uncle, that is very poor.\" But\r\n    upon the whole it may be asserted, that in social converse Burke\r\n    was equalled by none of his contemporaries and his countrymen,\r\n    except only Dr. Johnson himself and perhaps Lord Thurlow.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have no more room for further extracts; those we have made illustrate\r\nthe temper and the style of the work, and will commend it to the favorable\r\nconsideration of American readers. Among subjects treated most elaborately\r\nis that of the authorship of Junius; but Lord Mahon has no new facts for\r\nthe vindication of his judgment, that Sir Philip Francis was\r\nunquestionably the writer of the famous letters under that name.\r\n\r\nThere is an appendix to each volume; and in the appendix of one, and in\r\nthe notes of both, are some curious illustrations of the worthlessness of\r\nMr. Sparks’s editions of the writings of Washington and Franklin. We first\r\ncalled attention to this subject some five years ago, and after the\r\nchanges, &c. of Mr. Sparks had been pointed out in _The International_, a\r\nseries of carefully prepared criticisms appeared in the _Evening Post_, in\r\nwhich the discrepancies between the original letters of Washington were\r\nexhibited to a degree that at once and for ever destroyed the good\r\nreputation of Mr. Sparks in this department. He chose not to take any\r\nnotice of the disclosures to which we refer, but it may be that Lord\r\nMahon’s criticism will secure his attention, and an attempt, at least, for\r\nhis vindication. Besides his comparisons of MS. and printed letters in the\r\nappendix, Lord Mahon has several allusions to the subject, of which we\r\nquote specimens:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"Some samples of the manner in which that gentleman (Mr. Sparks)\r\n    has thought himself at liberty to tamper with the original MSS.,\r\n    will be found,\" &c.\r\n\r\n    \"Mr. Sparks has printed no part of the correspondence precisely as\r\n    Washington wrote it, but has greatly altered, and as he thinks,\r\n    corrected and embellished it. Such a liberty with the writings of\r\n    such a man might be justifiable, nay, even in some respects\r\n    necessary, if Washington and his principal contemporaries had been\r\n    still alive; but the date of this publication, the year (1838),\r\n    leaves, as I conceive, no adequate vindication for _tampering with\r\n    the truth of history_.\"\r\n\r\n    \"Washington, however, in his public letter to Congress (unless Mr.\r\n    Jared Sparks has _improved_ this passage), says,\" &c.\r\n\r\n    \"I know not whether my readers will concur with me in liking\r\n    Washington’s own and though home-spun, excellent cloth, much\r\n    better than the ’Cobweb schemes and gauze coverings’ which have,\r\n    it seems, been manufactured in its place.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nA complete errata to Mr. Sparks’s editions of Washington, Franklin, and\r\nGouverneur Morris, would occupy several volumes; and we do not remember\r\none instance in which his alterations were justifiable, or in which they\r\nwere really an improvement in point of style. The reprobation with which\r\nMr. Sparks has been visited by the learned and judicious of his own\r\ncountry and England will be a warning to future laborers in the same\r\nfield. The works edited by Mr. Sparks are no longer, we believe, regarded\r\nby historical students as of the slightest value as authorities, and no\r\nfaithfulness or excellence which may be displayed in future works from his\r\nhand will retrieve his lost reputation.\r\n\r\nThese volumes will be reprinted immediately by the Appletons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFAUST OF WITTENBERG AND FUST OF MENTZ.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt were well if writers on the origin of typography would obey the\r\ninjunction of Sir Thomas Browne, who thought it not inexpedient for those\r\nwho seek to enlighten mankind on any particular subject, first to acquire\r\nsome knowledge thereof themselves, so that the labor of readers should not\r\nso generally be profitless. In an article by Bishop McIlvaine, and another\r\nin Frazer’s Magazine, by an anonymous contributor, the exercise of\r\n_necromancy_ is imputed to Fust, the inventor or supposed inventor of\r\nprinting. Nine of every ten persons who write any thing on the subject\r\nfall into the same error; they have something always to say of Fust and\r\nthe devil; curious anecdotes to rehearse of the multiplication of copies\r\nof the Scriptures in Paris and elsewhere; spells and incantations by the\r\ninventor of the \"black\" art to describe, &c. But this is all induced by\r\nignorance of the facts. John Fust, the putative inventor of printing, was\r\na shrewd silversmith, and we suspect a knavish one, for without having any\r\nthing to do with the _invention_ of the \"art preservative of arts,\" he\r\nmanaged to rob another of the credit and profit of it. He was, however,\r\nnever in Paris; he was never in his lifetime accused of the exercise of\r\nmagical arts; he simply endeavored to make as much money as he could in\r\nGermany by underselling the copyists in the book market. All stories in\r\nwhich necromancy is attributed to him or to any other printer; all\r\naccounts of the opposition of the priests to typography as an infernal\r\ninvention; in fine, the whole popular idea of Faust and the devil, is a\r\nmodern contrivance, and originated in this manner: Some bookmaker, about\r\nthe year 1580, undertook to write a history of printing; he had an\r\nindistinct recollection of Professor Faustus of the University of\r\nWittenberg, and in his book blended as many of his adventures as he could\r\nremember with the memoirs of John Fust the printer; and from that day a\r\nsuccession of ignorant chroniclers have considered two men, of totally\r\ndifferent characters, living at different times, as one individual.\r\n\r\nFaust, the necromancer, was born in the duchy of Weimer in 1491,\r\ntwenty-five years after the printer is understood to have died. He is\r\nmentioned by Melancthon, Wierus, and many other cotemporary writers, and\r\nwas probably in his time not less distinguished as a magician than Agrippa\r\nor Albertus Magnus. It is related of him by Godwin, that he was in his\r\nyouth adopted by an uncle, dwelling in the city of Wittenberg, who had no\r\nchildren. Here he was sent to college, and was soon distinguished by the\r\ngreatness of his talents, and the rapid progress he made in every species\r\nof learning that was put before him. He was destined by his relative to\r\nthe profession of theology. But he is said ungraciously to have set at\r\nnaught his uncle’s pious intentions. He went through his examinations with\r\napplause, and carried off all the first prizes among sixteen competitors;\r\nhe therefore obtained the degree of doctor in divinity; but his success\r\nonly made him proud and headstrong. He disdained his theological eminence,\r\nand sighed for distinction as a man of the world. He took his degree as a\r\ndoctor of medicine, and aspired to celebrity as a practitioner of physic.\r\nAbout the same time he fell in with certain cotemporaries, of tastes\r\nsimilar to his own, and associated with them in the study of Chaldean,\r\nGreek, and Arabic science, of strange incantations and supernatural\r\ninfluences, in short, of all the arts of a sorcerer.\r\n\r\nHaving made such progress as he could by dint of study and intense\r\napplication, he at length resolved to prosecute his purposes still further\r\nby actually raising the devil. He happened one evening to walk in a thick,\r\ndark wood, within a short distance from Wittenberg, when it occurred to\r\nhim that that was a fit place for executing his design. He stopped at a\r\nsolitary spot where four roads met, and made use of his wand to mark out a\r\nlarge circle, and then two small ones within the larger. In one of these\r\nhe fixed himself, appropriating the other for the use of his expected\r\nvisitor. He went over the precise range of charms and incantations,\r\nomitting nothing. It was now dark night, between the ninth and tenth\r\nhours. The devil manifested himself by the usual signs of his appearance.\r\n\"Wherefore am I called?\" said he, \"and what is it that you demand?\" \"I\r\nrequire,\" rejoined Faustus, \"that you should sedulously attend unto me,\r\nanswer my inquiries, and fulfil my behests.\"\r\n\r\nImmediately upon Faustus pronouncing these words, there followed a tumult\r\noverhead, as if heaven and earth were coming together. The trees in their\r\ntopmost branches bended to their very roots. It seemed as if the whole\r\nforest were peopled with devils, making a crash like a thousand wagons,\r\nhurrying to the right and left, before and behind, in every possible\r\ndirection, with thunder and lightning, and the continual discharge of\r\ngreat cannon. Hell appeared to have emptied itself to have furnished the\r\ndin. There succeeded the most charming music from all sorts of\r\ninstruments, and sounds of hilarity and dancing. Next came a report as of\r\na tournament, and the clashing of innumerable lances. This lasted so long,\r\nthat Faustus was many times about to rush out of the circle in which he\r\nhad inclosed himself, and to abandon his preparations. His courage and\r\nresolution, however, got the better; and he remained immovable. He pursued\r\nhis incantations without intermission. Then came to the very edge of the\r\ncircle a griffin first, and next a dragon, which in the midst of his\r\nenchantments grinned at him horribly with his teeth, but finally fell down\r\nat his feet, and extended his length to many a rood. Faustus persisted.\r\nThen succeeded a sort of fireworks, a pillar of fire, and a man on fire at\r\nthe top, who leaped down; and there immediately appeared a number of\r\nglobes here and there red-hot, while the man on fire went and came to\r\nevery part of the circle for a quarter of an hour. At length the devil\r\ncame forward in the shape of a gray monk, and asked Faustus what he\r\nwanted. Faustus adjourned their further conference, and appointed the\r\ndevil to comes to him at his lodging.\r\n\r\nHe in the mean time busied himself in the necessary preparations. He\r\nentered his study at the appointed time, and found the devil waiting for\r\nhim. Faustus told him that he had prepared certain articles, to which it\r\nwas necessary that the demon should fully accord,—that he should attend\r\nhim at all times, when required, for all the days of his life; that he\r\nshould bring him every thing he wanted; that he should come to him in any\r\nshape that Faustus required, or be invisible, and Faustus should be\r\ninvisible too whenever he desired it; that he should deny him nothing, and\r\nanswer him with perfect veracity to every thing he demanded. To some of\r\nthese requisitions the spirit could not consent, without authority from\r\nhis master, the chief of devils. At length all these concessions were\r\nadjusted. The devil on his part also prescribed his conditions. That\r\nFaustus should abjure the Christian religion and all reverence for the\r\nsupreme God; that he should enjoy the entire command of his attendant\r\ndemon for a certain term of years; and that at the end of that period the\r\ndevil should dispose of him, body and soul, at his pleasure [the term was\r\nfixed for twenty-four years]; that he should at all times steadfastly\r\nrefuse to listen to any one who should desire to convert him, or convince\r\nhim of the error of his ways, and lead him to repentance; that Faustus\r\nshould draw up a writing containing these particulars, and sign it with\r\nhis blood; that he should deliver this writing to the devil, and keep a\r\nduplicate of it himself, that so there might be no misunderstanding. It\r\nwas further appointed by Faustus, that the devil should usually attend him\r\nin the habit of a cordelier, with a pleasing countenance and an\r\ninsinuating demeanor. Faustus also asked the devil his name, who answered\r\nthat he was usually called Mephistophiles.\r\n\r\nNumerous adventures of Faustus are related in the German histories. It is\r\nsaid that the emperor Charles V. was at Inspruck, at a time when Faustus\r\nalso resided there. His courtiers informed the emperor that Faustus was in\r\nthe town, and Charles expressed a desire to see him. He was introduced.\r\nCharles asked him whether he could really perform such wondrous feats as\r\nwere reported of him. Faustus modestly replied, inviting the emperor to\r\nmake trial of his skill. \"Then,\" said Charles, \"of all the eminent\r\npersonages I have ever read of, Alexander the Great is the man who most\r\nexcites my curiosity, and whom it would most gratify my wishes to see in\r\nthe very form in which he lived.\" Faustus rejoined that it was out of his\r\npower truly to raise the dead, but that he had spirits at his command who\r\nhad often seen that great conqueror, and that Faustus would willingly\r\nplace him before the emperor as he required. He conditioned that Charles\r\nshould not speak to him, nor attempt to touch him. The emperor promised\r\ncompliance. After a few ceremonies, therefore, Faustus opened a door, and\r\nbrought in Alexander exactly in the form in which he had lived, with the\r\nsame garments, and every circumstance corresponding. Alexander made his\r\nobeisance to the emperor, and walked several times round him. The queen of\r\nAlexander was then introduced in the same manner. Charles just then\r\nrecollected he had read that Alexander had a wart on the nape of his neck;\r\nand with proper precautions Faustus allowed the emperor to examine the\r\napparition by this test. Alexander then vanished.\r\n\r\nAs Faustus was approaching the last year of his term, he seemed resolved\r\nto pamper his appetite with every species of luxury. He carefully\r\naccumulated all the materials of voluptuousness and magnificence. He was\r\nparticularly anxious in the selection of women who should serve for his\r\npleasures. He had one Englishwoman, one Hungarian, one French, two of\r\nGermany, and two from different parts of Italy, all of them eminent for\r\nthe perfections which characterized their different countries.\r\n\r\nAt length he arrived at the end of the term for which he had contracted\r\nwith the devil. For two or three years before it expired his character\r\ngradually altered. He became subject to fits of despondency, was no longer\r\nsusceptible of mirth and amusement, and reflected with bitter agony on the\r\nclose in which the whole must terminate. He assembled his friends together\r\nat a grand entertainment, and when it was over, addressed them, telling\r\nthem that this was the last day of his life, reminding them of the wonders\r\nwith which he had frequently astonished them, and informing them of the\r\ncondition upon which he had held this power. They, one and all, expressed\r\nthe deepest sorrow at the intelligence. They had had the idea of something\r\nunlawful in his proceedings; but their notions had been very far from\r\ncoming up to the truth. They regretted exceedingly that he had not been\r\nunreserved in his communications at an earlier period. They would have had\r\nrecourse in his behalf, to the means of religion, and have applied to\r\npious men, desiring them to employ their power to intercede with Heaven in\r\nhis favor. Prayer and penitence might have done much for him; and the\r\nmercy of Heaven was unbounded. They advised him to still call upon God,\r\nand endeavor to secure an interest in the merits of the Saviour.\r\n\r\nFaustus assured them that it was all in vain, and that his tragical fate\r\nwas inevitable. He led them to their sleeping apartment, and recommended\r\nto them to pass the night as they could, but by no means, whatever they\r\nmight happen to hear, to come out of it; as their interference could in no\r\nway be beneficial to him, and might be attended with the most serious\r\ninjury to themselves. They lay still, therefore, as he had enjoined them;\r\nbut not one of them could close his eyes. Between twelve and one in the\r\nnight they heard first a furious storm of wind round all sides of the\r\nhouse, as if it would have torn away the walls from their foundations.\r\nThis no sooner somewhat abated, than a noise was heard of discordant and\r\nviolent hissing, as if the house was full of all sorts of venomous\r\nreptiles, but which plainly proceeded from Faustus’s chamber. Next they\r\nheard the doctor’s room-door vehemently burst open, and cries for help\r\nuttered with dreadful agony, but in a half-suppressed voice, which\r\npresently grew fainter and fainter. Then every thing became still, as if\r\nthe everlasting motion of the world was suspended.\r\n\r\nWhen at length it became broad day, the students went in a body to the\r\ndoctor’s apartment. But he was nowhere to be seen. Only the walls were\r\nfound smeared with his blood, and marks as if his brains had been dashed\r\nout. His body was finally discovered at some distance from the house, his\r\nlimbs dismembered, and marks of great violence about the features of his\r\nface. The students gathered up the mutilated parts of his body, and\r\nafforded them private burial at the temple of Mars, in the village where\r\nhe died.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSOME SMALL POEMS.\r\n\r\n\r\n             WRITTEN FOR THE INTERNATIONAL MONTHLY MAGAZINE.\r\n\r\n\r\nBY R.

But what are ten crusts of bread per annum among a\r\nthousand hungry dogs?\r\n\r\nThou must face the truth, young college boy, who now and then dost stroll\r\ninto court-rooms, or who dost lounge away an hour in a friend’s law office\r\nadmiring his books and piles of papers—thinking the while of the time when\r\nthou wilt have graduated and obtained permission to hang up thy\r\npomp-gilded \"shingle:\" _thou must face the truth_! The counsel who so\r\nattracts thy admiration, in thy court-room lounging, has fought weary\r\nyears with myriad obstacles; there are the ashes of many nights and days\r\nof toil and struggle sprinkled upon his hair; he has fought his way (from\r\nwhere thou sittest a listener to where he stands a speaker), as if through\r\nan Indian gauntlet file. There were a hundred mouths waiting for the first\r\ncrumbs which came to his impatient legal digestion; and a hundred envious\r\nheads and hearts to worry him if possible into a dyspepsia over those\r\ncrumbs. He has began with an office in a fifth story, and _climbed down_\r\ntowards the street. He commenced to hive his honey near the roof! While\r\nout of his office he climbed a professional ladder, the holding on to\r\nwhich tasked all his powers of physical, mental, and pecuniary endurance.\r\nFace the truth!\r\n\r\nReach me yonder diary and legal register. Two thousand practising lawyers\r\nin the city of New-York! Out of these one hundred are \"notables;\" fifty\r\nare \"distinguished;\" twenty-five are eminent.\r\n\r\nA large body of them are \"conveyancers\" growing thin in person and thinner\r\nin mind over deeds and titles; a larger body \"attorneys\"—getters up and\r\nsupervisors of suits—providers of ammunition for \"distinguished counsel\"\r\nto discharge with loud reports (the said counsel brilliant by the flash:\r\nthe attorney obscured in the smoke); many, very many, chained to\r\n\"larcenies\" at the Sessions, \"landlord dispossessions\" at the Marine\r\nCourt, suits on butcher’s bills at Ward Courts, or \"malicious\r\nprosecutions\" in the Common Pleas.\r\n\r\nYet there are hundreds of coral reefs and pearls for persevering divers in\r\nthis ocean of litigation. Three thousand pending cases every month are\r\nthree thousand nutshells where the meat is often fresh and oily, even with\r\nthe weary keeping on the calendar for months and years. There are _some_\r\ncounsel who pocket fees and costs to the tune of twenty thousand a year.\r\nWe know many a Quirk, Gammon and Snap, who realize an undoubted \"ten\r\nthousand a year,\" with no Tittlebat Titmouse for a standing annoyance. And\r\nwe can taper off on the finger many who do not realize five hundred a\r\nyear, and work like negro slaves at that: they are continually rough\r\nhewing, but no divinity shapes their ends.\r\n\r\nFive years of \"starvation,\" and five more years of toil and trouble,\r\nconstitute the depth of a lawyer’s slough of despond in New-York; to say\r\nnothing of the giants’ castles to storm upon the way, or the fights with\r\nthe Apolyons of Envy. Obviously so!\r\n\r\nA man now-a-days will let a young Sawbones advise ice for his child’s\r\ncroup, or even experiment with his own much-abused liver, when he would\r\nnot intrust a young attorney with the suing a note where ten witnesses saw\r\nthe note signed and the \"consideration money\" paid over. And if the public\r\nreally knew how much danger their pockets were in when the \"buttons\" were\r\nunder the control of inexperienced lawyers, the number of \"starvers\" would\r\nbe doubled. What \"eminent\" lawyer is there who does not look back to the\r\n\"practice\" of his youth, in perfect terror to witness the mistakes he\r\nmade, as the helmsman, who has scudded through the breakers to the open\r\nsea, glances back at the dangers he escaped?\r\n\r\nThe young lawyers of a year back are, however, five years—perhaps ten—in\r\nadvance of the lawyers of this year’s growth. The latter have greater\r\nrivalry in the _hordes_ of practitioners from the interior whom the \"new\r\ncode\" have driven from their _trespass quare clausum fregit_ into the\r\ncity. Many of them, too, were men of mark in their ports of departure,\r\nbold and confident in their new haven!\r\n\r\nOne field, however, in the legal township of this city, offers room upon\r\nits face for tillers—_the field of advocacy_! It is ploughed by some\r\ntwenty or thirty, and _harrowed_ by some fifty or sixty. There are a\r\n_dozen_ whom the ghosts of Nisi Prius flock to hear upon great occasions.\r\nAnd these will long hold the monopoly.\r\n\r\nWhy?\r\n\r\nBecause the advocate and barrister must have had vast experience at Nisi\r\nPrius (or the court where matters of fact are investigated by judge and\r\njury); have acquired a practised tact; have had opportunities of testing\r\ntheir own calibre to know if they are fitted for emergencies—as the\r\ngunsmith tests his barrels before he \"stocks\" them. And the young lawyer\r\nhas small opportunity afforded him to acquire this tact—to permit this\r\ntesting. If he can play \"devil\" for a few years to some barrister of\r\nextended practice, or scent \"occasions\" like a blood-hound on the trail of\r\nthe valuable fugitive from justice, then he is a happy man, and is in the\r\nfair way of soon becoming a monopolist himself.\r\n\r\nAny juryman of two years’ standing will corroborate our statement as to\r\nthe openness of the field of legal advocacy. How often has he seen cause\r\nafter cause \"set down,\" \"reserved,\" or \"put off,\" because counsel are\r\nengaged elsewhere? How often has he heard the same advocate in four or\r\nfive causes in the same week, in the same court, changing positions like\r\nthe queen of an active chess-board; profiting his fame and pocket by means\r\nof only a hurried glance at the elaborate brief which his junior has \"got\r\nup\" for him?\r\n\r\nSome one has said that the barrister works hard, lives well, and dies\r\npoor. Regarding the first two conditions of his life there is little doubt\r\nupon the question of truth; the dying in poverty _may be_ problematical.\r\nYet in a recent print, professing to furnish a list of wealthy tax-payers,\r\nthe list contained four lawyers, and only one was a barrister. The\r\ninstance proves little, for a lawyer may be very rich and yet pay no\r\ntaxes. The assessors may fight shy of his bell-pull as they go their\r\nrounds, because of his penchant to find flaws in their actions and bring\r\nthem official discredit in an apparently laborious task, but in reality a\r\nsinecure of an employment.\r\n\r\nWe have often asked ourselves if barristers have stomachs. Bowels of\r\ncompassion they have not, that is certain; but have they stomachs? Say\r\nnine times in a year they dine at the same hour of the day; and then spoon\r\ntheir soup with the blood all drawn from the digestive apparatus to feed\r\nthe brain. Yet they eat like aldermen and drink like German princes....\r\n\r\nThis much of idle reverie, as, with pen in hand, we laid down the two\r\nbulky and elaborately-published volumes whose title we have taken as text;\r\nthis much of glance at the condition of the young and old advocate of\r\nto-day, before we digest our reflections upon the advocate and jurist of\r\nthe past.\r\n\r\nIt was our privilege in our legal novitiate (this is but _a phrase_; for a\r\nlawyer is always in his novitiate) to have been, at the Cambridge Law\r\nSchool, a pupil of Mr. Justice Story; and thus to have drank at the very\r\nfountain head of constitutional law—that branch of our national\r\njurisprudence which can least fluctuate. Judges of a day and not of a\r\ngeneration, or crazy legislators with spasmodic wisdom, may alter, and\r\noverturn, and mystify by simplification, the laws and usages of every-day\r\nlife; but it is scarcely to be apprehended that the current of our\r\nconstitutional law will ever be diverted from original channels. There is\r\ndanger rather of its being dammed into stagnation.\r\n\r\nWhile fully aware of his faults and foibles as a man, and his\r\nidiosyncracies as a judge and a legal writer, we have never wavered in\r\nloyalty to his judicial majesty, or found a flaw in the regard we paid to\r\nhis memory. And no book was more welcome to Zimmerman in his solitude than\r\nthese volumes regarding the illustrious judge, prepared by his son, were\r\nwelcome to our Christmas-holiday leisure.\r\n\r\nJoseph Story was the eldest of eleven children, and lived to be indeed the\r\n\"Joseph\" of mark and renown to his father and brothers. He was born in\r\nMarblehead, September 18th, 1779. His father was a physician, and served\r\nduring a portion of the Revolution as army surgeon. He died when the\r\nfuture judge was twenty-six years of age: yet what the son then was is\r\nbest told by one sentence from the father’s will—after making his wife\r\nsole executrix, he recommends her to his son Joseph, adding, \"and although\r\nthis perhaps is needless, I do it to mark my special confidence in his\r\naffections, skill, and abilities.\" From the father, our lawyer thus\r\npanegyrized received friendly geniality and broad understanding; from the\r\nmother, indomitable will, vigor and enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nHabit of observation and desire of knowledge were the prominent attributes\r\nof his childish character; nevertheless he was ardent in all the sports of\r\nboyhood. To the last he maintained a regard for his honor, which induced\r\nhim while yet a lad, and under promise not to divulge the name of a\r\nschoolmate offender, to receive a severe flogging rather than to yield up\r\nhis knowledge upon the subject. At the age of sixteen, in the midst of a\r\nFreshman term at Harvard College, he thought of matriculation; but upon\r\ninquiry learned that he must not only be examined upon the works of\r\nordinary preparatory reading, but that it was necessary for him to expect\r\na call upon the volumes which his class had dispatched during the past\r\nhalf year. At first he was daunted, but remembering there yet remained six\r\nweeks of vacation, he addressed himself to the necessary labor—the\r\nseverity of which is best evidenced by the fact that in the short time\r\nabove mentioned he read Sallust, the odes of Horace, two books of Livy,\r\nthree books of the Anabasis, two books of the Iliad, and certain English\r\ntreatises. This sounds like the railroad instruction now much in vogue;\r\nbut its effects were permanent in value upon his mind. Few readers of his\r\nworks will accuse him of a want of proficiency in Latin! But the _often_\r\nreading—the _saepe legendo_ was ever his habit: for he remembered the\r\ncouplet:\r\n\r\n  Gutta cavat lapidem non vi sed saepe cadendo\r\n  Sic homo fit doctus non vi sed saepe legendo.\r\n\r\nHe passed muster with the college tutors in January, 1795. Among his\r\nclassmates were the (afterwards Reverends) Dr. Tuckerman and Wm. E.\r\nChanning—to the genius and character of the latter of whom he always bore\r\nthe most enthusiastic and hearty testimony. Indeed he contested with\r\nChanning for the highest honor. Channing won it, but always gave the honor\r\nhimself to Story; while the latter always declared that the former won the\r\njust meed of his genius and scholarship.\r\n\r\nTheir graduation was in the summer of 1798: and immediately upon quitting\r\ncollege Mr. Story commenced the study of the law with Mr. Samuel Sewall,\r\nafterwards Chief Justice in the Supreme Court of Massachusetts. Fourteen\r\nhours a day was over his quantum of study. Although sometimes\r\ndisheartened, he never surrendered his determination to master the\r\nelements and details of his new profession.\r\n\r\n_Studying_ law in those days was a far different thing from its _reading_\r\nnow. Then it was _multum_: now it is _multa_. No copious indexes and\r\nmultifarious treatises were counted by thousands: no digests (directories\r\nto the streets, the avenues, the fountains and the temples of the\r\nscience), abounded by scores. Libraries were carried about in wheelbarrows\r\nand not in processions of vans, when the inexorable moving day came\r\naround. Learned judges were not then compelled to hold courts in remote\r\nvillages (resorting hereby to a _coup de loi_), in order to escape the\r\n_cacoethes loquendi_ of case lawyers and presuming juniors. Legal lore was\r\nbuilded up like the massive stone and hard grained mortar of the edifices\r\nof that olden time—slowly, carefully, but lastingly; not as are builded\r\nnow the brick and stuccoed mansions of the snob and parvenu. Not that\r\nabounding treatises and familiarizing digests forbid the idea of the\r\nperfect lawyer now-a-days: only that to-day the law student in the midst\r\nof a large library stands more in need (when thinking of the _otium_ which\r\naccompanies certain dignity), to utter the ejaculation, \"lead us not into\r\ntemptation\"—the temptation of possessing that knowledge which teaches\r\nwhere to seek for information, and not the kind which is information of\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nIn 1801 Mr. Story came to the Salem bar while at the age of twenty-two.\r\nAfter being three years at practice he married his first wife, who died\r\nwithin two years afterward, plunging him into the deepest grief. During\r\nhis courtship he dabbled (as almost every young lawyer does until he finds\r\nthat clients are severe critics) in poetry, and wrote a didactic poem of\r\ntwo parts in heroic verse, entitled \"The Power of Solitude.\" Adopting the\r\ncriticism of the biographers—its prominent defects were exaggeration of\r\nfeeling, confusion of imagery, want of simplicity of expression, stilted\r\nand artificial style. But though dull as a poem, it shows facility and\r\ntalent for versification, breathes a warm aspiration for virtue and truth,\r\nand is creditable to the scholarship of its author.\r\n\r\nAfter the loss of his wife he sought relief from painful thoughts in the\r\nlaborious duties of a large and increasing business. His position at the\r\nbar was prominent, and he was engaged in nearly all the cases of\r\nimportance. His manner to the jury was earnest and spirited; he managed\r\nhis causes with tact (that great acquirement of the successful lawyer:\r\nbeing, as a distinguished barrister now dead and gone said to Dr. Hosack,\r\nthe same sheet anchor to the advocate which mercury or bark is to the\r\nphysician), was ready in attack or defence, and possessed great eloquence\r\nof expression. As an advocate he showed a sagacity of perception which no\r\nintricacy of detail could blind, no suddenness of attack confuse, and\r\nwhich afterwards so distinguished him as a Judge. He was thrown among the\r\nleading lawyers; and undaunted as all young lawyers should be (although\r\npreserving their modesty of deportment and learning), he measured swords\r\nwith the most accomplished. Although sometimes vanquished, he always\r\nreceived honors from even the victors.\r\n\r\nIt is a prevailing opinion with the junior members of the legal\r\nprofession, that their seniors delight in snubbing them; that they are\r\nfond of being discourteous, and arrogant; that they are envious of some\r\nand insulting to others. But it is rare indeed that the seniors err on\r\nother ground in this respect than magnanimity. The industrious youngster,\r\nthe self-reliant youngster, the firm but respectful youngster, the versed\r\nin elementary principles among youngsters, are always received with open\r\narms. Law begets law. If the junior commences a suit a senior may answer\r\nit: and the reverse. The parson and the doctor are in perpetual\r\ninterference with the neighbors and brethren of their particular calling.\r\nBut lawyers, like bees in the beehive, must of necessity assist and succor\r\neach other, or there will be less honey laid away when the summer is past\r\nand the harvest ended.\r\n\r\nEarly in his professional career he became an ardent politician. He was a\r\nJeffersonian Democrat, and at the bar of his residence stood almost alone\r\nin his partisan position. As such a party man he went into the State\r\nLegislature, and became an acknowledged leader. He possessed that great\r\nquality for a leader, the faculty of extempore speaking, joined with the\r\nability to condense and elucidate the topics he took in hand. But he never\r\nsubmitted the convictions of his judgment to party dictation; and soon\r\nafter his entering the arena of legislative warfare, he bravely stemmed\r\nparty tide in advocating an increase of salaries for the State judges. The\r\nlatter were all federalists, and it was not to be wondered that the\r\nrepublicans of that day, who wore in their noses the rings of party,\r\nshould shrug their shoulders at the prospect of benefiting political\r\nopponents. But by his firm conduct, and by his confident assertion and\r\nable arguments in favor of the measure, it was carried. And to Joseph\r\nStory, more than any other man, Massachusetts is indebted for the\r\nopportunity of employing ablest judicial officers, without making their\r\nfamilies beggars.\r\n\r\nIt is the disgrace of our country that its judicial officers are the most\r\npoorly paid of all professions and pursuits. And in every section of the\r\nUnion, that distinguished lawyer who accepts a seat upon the bench, must\r\nhold the glories of his honor at a very high price, to surrender his\r\nordinary professional emoluments for the wretched pittance which the\r\nvarious States dole out for days of public toil and nights of private\r\nstudy. We desire to look no further than this Empire State for examples.\r\nThis Empire State, with its magnificent resources and proudly developing\r\nenergies, should be the last to unite in adjudging its judicial officers\r\nto the labors of galley slaves, and to then pay them by the year less than\r\na ballet-dancer receives by the month in all its principal cities. Two\r\nthousand five hundred dollars per year is the astounding sum which this\r\nsame Empire State pays to its highest judicial officers. If we reverse the\r\nsaying of Walpole, and read \"_every price has its man_,\" we may not wonder\r\nif Dogberries and grandmothers are occasionally found upon the bench,\r\ndispensing their honest but destructive platitudes, and their Malaprop\r\nconstructions of commercial law, to juries of astounded merchants.\r\n\r\nFrom the arena of State politics, Mr. Story next changed his position to\r\nthe temple of national discussions at Washington. His career in Congress\r\nwas, however, limited to one session, and to a vacancy-seat occasioned by\r\na death. He declined re-election; for in the words of his autobiographical\r\naccount of this portion of his career, he had lost all relish for\r\npolitical controversy, and had found that an entire obedience to party\r\nprojects required such constant sacrifices of opinion and feeling, that he\r\npreferred to devote himself with singleness of heart to the study of the\r\nlaw, which was at all times the object of his admiration and almost\r\nexclusive devotion. Public sentiment, however, forced him again into the\r\nState councils at home, where more liberty of professional engagement was\r\npermitted. He was in political life but a brief period again, before, in\r\nhis thirty-second year, President Madison pressed his acceptance of a\r\nvacant Associate Justiceship in the Supreme Court of the United States,\r\nwhich had been declined by Levi Lincoln and by John Quincy Adams, then in\r\nRussia. Although the acceptance involved the surrender of heavy\r\nprofessional emolument, the high honor, the permanence of the tenure, and\r\nthe opportunity of gratifying his juridical studies that he so much loved,\r\njoined in compelling his acquiescence.\r\n\r\n\"The atrocious crime of being a young man,\" which had compelled a hatred\r\nof William Pitt the younger, in a former day, was now brought up against\r\nhim by many whose party subserviency fairly blushed before his manly\r\nintegrity, and by others who envied him his success. But one year at the\r\nCircuit silenced all complaint. And in his thirty-third year he was\r\nacknowledged to be the able jurist whom, at his death in his sixty-sixth\r\nyear of age, a whole nation mourned.\r\n\r\nDismissing for the present all consideration of his judicial life, and all\r\nestimate of his ability upon the bench, and passing over nearly twenty\r\nyears of his life, we meet him in the possession of his fourth great honor\r\nin life—but an honor which was ever the first prized by him in all his\r\nafter career—the appointment of Law Professor in Cambrige Law School.\r\n\r\nMr. Nathan Dane, whose Abridgement of American law in many volumes had\r\nobtained for him the gratitude of the profession at large, and the more\r\nsubstantial testimonial of pecuniary profit, had determined, about the\r\nfiftieth year of Judge Story’s life, to repay the law some of the profits\r\nwhich its votaries had bestowed upon him, by donating ten thousand dollars\r\nfor the establishment of a new professorship.  He annexed to his donation,\r\nhowever, the condition that Judge Story should be the incumbent. To the\r\ngreat delight of the donor, and of the College Fellows, the Judge\r\nassented, and was inaugurated as Dane Professor of Law, with a special\r\nview to Lectures upon the Law of Nations, Commercial and Maritime Law,\r\nFederal Law and Equity—a station which he filled to the day of his\r\nlamented death.\r\n\r\nThis brief survey of his life presents him then in several public aspects;\r\nas a student, as an advocate, as a statesman, as a judge, and as an\r\nexpounder of the great principles of law, which he worshipped with an\r\nidolatry of love.\r\n\r\nTo speak of his political career would not belong to the scope of our\r\narticle. And to sit in judgment upon his judicial career would be our\r\npresumption. Older and abler pens must render their tributes to the extent\r\nand varied richness of his legal lore, which, taking root in principles,\r\nbranched into the minutiæ of detail, under every sun and in every clime\r\nwhere law is recognized as a rule of human action. His judicial fame can\r\nnever be increased or diminished by individual estimate. The law of\r\npatents, of admiralty and prizes, the jurisprudence of equity, and above\r\nall, his luminous explorations of what were once constitutional\r\nlabyrinths, are monuments as indestructible as the Pyramids. If every\r\ntrace of their original oneness be lost, they will yet live in the hours\r\nof future judicial days, in professional acts, and in the guiding policy\r\nof a remote posterity. His library of treatises are legal classics; and\r\nthe worst defects which flippant carpers and canvassers of their claims to\r\nmerit have discovered in their pages, have been their richness of detail\r\nand polish of learning! And no one can deny that as a judge he was the\r\nvery example which ’Hobbes’ in his ’Leviathan,’ carried in mind when he\r\nthus wrote—\"the things that make a good judge or good interpreter of the\r\nlaws, are first—a right understanding of that principal law of nature\r\ncalled Equity, which depending not on the reading of other men’s writings,\r\nbut on the goodness of a man’s own natural reason and meditation, is\r\npresumed to be in those most who have had most leisure and the most\r\ninclination to meditate thereon; second—contempt of unnecessary riches and\r\npreferments; third—to be able in judgment to divest himself of all fear,\r\nanger, hatred, love and compassion; fourthly and lastly—patience to hear,\r\ndiligent attention in hearing, and memory to retain, digest, and apply\r\nwhat he hath heard.\"\r\n\r\nNot the least amiable phase of the life of Judge Story, was the attention\r\nwhich he gave to letters and literary pursuits. He was no _mere_ lawyer:\r\nno stringer of professional centos. He never hid his heart with the veil\r\nof dignity; nor smothered his fresh impulses (preserved intact from\r\nworldly rust since boyhood) with the weight of his judicial and\r\nprofessional labors. While he believed that the law was a jealous\r\nmistress, he knew that this mistress was too stable and sensible to decree\r\nthat a gentle dalliance or seasonable flirtation with her maids of\r\nhonor—Poetry, or the Arts, or Literature, or Love—was an unloyal act. He\r\ncould turn from Grotius to Dickens, from Vattel to Thackeray. He could\r\ndigest the points of the elaborate arguments of eminent counsel, and then\r\nturn aside to a gentle tonic from the administrating hand of Smollett or\r\nWalter Scott. Method was his master-key to all the combinations in the\r\nlocks of labor.\r\n\r\nTwice married he never ceased to eulogize the bliss of domesticity.\r\nSurrounded by loving eyes, the currents of his freshened affection flowed\r\ndeeper and clearer every year. How he treasured home and home joys may be\r\ncollected in the following lines from his poem on solitude (before\r\nreferred to), written in his twenty-second year.\r\n\r\n  \"Grandeur may dazzle with its transient glare\r\n  The herd of folly, and the tribe of care,\r\n  Who sport and flutter through their listless days,\r\n  Like motes that bask in Summer’s noontide blaze,\r\n  With anxious steps round vacant splendor while,\r\n  Live on a look, and banquet on a smile;\r\n  But the firm race whose high endowments claim\r\n  The laurel-wreath that decks the brow of fame;\r\n  Who warmed by sympathy’s electric glow,\r\n  In rapture tremble, and dissolve in woe,\r\n  Blest in _retirement_, scorn the frowns of fate,\r\n  And feel a transport power can ne’er create.\"\r\n\r\nTouching the poem from which these lines are taken, we remember being\r\nshown the only copy of the published book which was known to exist, by the\r\nfamily of the Judge. The Assistant Librarian (who was born for his station\r\nin all that regards enthusiastic love of his duties), of the Harvard\r\nCollege library, showed us, with great triumph, a small sheep-bound\r\nvolume, entitled \"Solitude and other Poems, by Joseph Story,\" printed\r\nsometime in the commencement of this century: saying, \"the Judge has\r\nburned all the copies he can pick up, and this is only to be read here.\"\r\nThis poem was a sore subject to the author. He viewed it as not only a\r\nblot upon his dignity, but an annoyance to his professional fame. Numerous\r\ncritics have laughed at it; but apart from the shorter poems, the main\r\ntheme showed much aptitude of poetic imagery, invention, and harmony of\r\nexpression. Glance at the following lines, which contain much of the\r\ngenuine spark:\r\n\r\n  \"Till nature’s self the Vandal torch should raise,\r\n  And the vast alcove of creation blaze.\"\r\n\r\nOr this—\r\n\r\n  \"Blaze the vast domes inwrought with fretted gold,\r\n  The sumptuous pavements veins or pearl unfold,\r\n  Arch piled on arch with columned pride ascend,\r\n  Grove linked to grove their mingling shadows blend.\"\r\n\r\nOr this—\r\n\r\n  \"Let narrow prudence boast its grovelling art\r\n  To chill the generous sympathies of heart,\r\n  Teach to subdue each thought sublimely wild,\r\n  And crush, like Herod, fancy’s new-born child.\"\r\n\r\nIt is highly probable that the learned Justice, knowing his taste for the\r\npoetical and fanciful, and his aptitude at the harmony of language, often\r\nerred in his judicial writings and treatises, by avoiding beauty of\r\nexpression, in fear lest the dignity of his subject should be injured by\r\ntoo much association with the creatures of fancy. We have known most\r\naccomplished lawyers err through this same caution. Our biographer himself\r\n(Mr. William W. Story) has certainly done himself great injustice as a\r\nwriter in his work on \"Contracts,\" when, in the pages before us, he\r\npresents us with so much delicacy of fancy and rhetorical finish.\r\nBlackstone in his \"Commentaries,\" Jones in his \"Bailment\" treatise,\r\nStephens in his essay upon \"Pleading,\" time-honored Fearne in his\r\n\"Contingent Remainders,\" have shown how grateful and how suitable it is\r\nfor the legal readers to find brilliancy of rhetoric adorning the most\r\nprofound learning.\r\n\r\nBut certainly Judge Story possessed to a remarkable degree the faculty of\r\ncondensation in his poetical works. His rhyme was not reason run mad; but\r\nreason in modest holiday attire. Where are lines at once so compact and so\r\nsearching in their wisdom as the following, penned in 1832, as matters of\r\nadvice to a young law student:\r\n\r\n  \"Whene’er you speak, remember every cause\r\n  Stands not on eloquence, but stands on laws—\r\n  Pregnant in matter, in expression brief,\r\n  Let every sentence stand in bold relief;\r\n  On trifling points nor time nor talents waste,\r\n  A sad offence to learning and to taste;\r\n  Nor deal with pompous phrase; nor e’er suppose\r\n  Poetic flights belong to reasoning prose,\r\n  Loose declamation may deceive the crowd,\r\n  And seem more striking as it grows more loud;\r\n  But sober sense rejects it with disdain,\r\n  As nought but empty noise, and weak as vain.\r\n  The froth of words, the school-boy’s vain parade\r\n  Of books and cases—all his stock in trade—\r\n  The pert conceits, the cunning tricks and play\r\n  Of low attorneys, strung in long array,\r\n  The unseemly jest, the petulent reply,\r\n  That chatters on, and cares not how, or why,\r\n  Studious, avoid—unworthy themes to scan,\r\n  They sink the speaker and disgrace the man.\r\n  Like the false lights, by flying shadows cast,\r\n  Scarce seen when present, and forgot when past.\r\n    Begin with dignity: expound with grace\r\n  Each ground of reasoning in its time and place;\r\n  Let order reign throughout—each topic touch,\r\n  Nor urge its power too little, or too much.\r\n  Give each strong thought its most attractive view,\r\n  In diction clear, and yet severely true,\r\n  And as the arguments in splendor grow,\r\n  Let each reflect its light on all below.\r\n  When to the close arrive make no delays\r\n  By petty flourishes, or verbal plays,\r\n  But sum the whole in one deep solemn strain,\r\n  Like a strong current hastening to the main.\"\r\n\r\nIf Mr. Story had never been elevated to the bench it is not likely his\r\nname would ever have become national property. Although plunged into\r\npolitics in his earlier life, he was not fitted for the life. His devotion\r\nto the law, and his dread of becoming that slave to party usages which all\r\npublic men must necessarily more or less fashion of themselves, would have\r\nretained him in his native state, and made his usefulness sectional. To\r\nthe politicians of the school of General Jackson, and to the\r\nadministration of that President, he was particularly distasteful. His\r\ntenacious conservatism drew forth from the \"old hero,\" on one occasion,\r\nthe remark, that \"he was the most dangerous man in the country.\" Lord\r\nEldon, with his doubts and pertinacious toryism was not more unpopular\r\namong the reformers in England than was Judge Story—the last of the old\r\nregime of federal judges—with the bank radicals of 1832.\r\n\r\nWhen Chief Justice Marshall died he felt almost broken-hearted. A new race\r\nof constitutional expounders had arisen around him. Brother justices, with\r\nmodern constructions, and more liberal notions of national law, were by\r\nhis side. In many decisions he was now a sole dissenter. His pride was\r\ninvaded; his self-love tortured; his adoration of certain legal\r\nconstructions which he had deemed immutable in their nature, was\r\ndesecrated. And, for many years previous to his decease, he had\r\ncontemplated resigning from the federal judiciary, and living alone for\r\nhis darling law school.\r\n\r\nThis school was his adopted child. He had taken it in a feeble and\r\nhelpless infancy. He had given it strength and increased vitality. He\r\nbrought it up to a vigorous and useful maturity. It was loved by only a\r\nhandful of students when he gave his name and talents to aid its life: but\r\nwhen he died, a hundred and fifty pupils were its warm suitors, and\r\nhundreds of lawyers over the whole union cherished its prosperity as a\r\nlink in their own chains of happiness.\r\n\r\nAnd, although he thought not of it, his labors in the law school secure\r\nfor his memory in the present generation a more brilliant existence than\r\nhis array of judicial decisions, and his thousands of written pages, can\r\never bestow. In some pine forest settlement of Maine, or in some rude\r\ncourt-house in California, there are lawyers who bring before them every\r\nday his genial smiles and his impressive lectures, looked upon and heard\r\nby them in former times at Cambridge. Over all the Union, in almost every\r\nvillage, town, and city, are his pupils. Each one of them may sometimes\r\nreflect with rapture upon their days of college life, or remember with\r\npride their first professional success: but not one of these\r\nconsiderations of reminiscence is so grateful to his mind as the thought\r\nof his novitiate with Justice Story. Depend upon it he treasures up those\r\nCambridge text-books, those Cambridge note-books whose leaves\r\ndaguerreotype the learning of the eminent deceased, those catalogues of\r\nstudents where his name is proudly found, as the most valuable portions of\r\nhis library. He will never part with them: but they will descend to his\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\nIt was our privilege and pleasure also to know Mr. Justice Story at\r\nCambridge; to have spent days of pleasure in the hours of his society; to\r\nhave rendered to his teachings the tribute of delighted attention and\r\ngrateful recollection. We, too, have been fascinated with that\r\nconversation, whose variety of exuberance and sometimes egotism, were its\r\ngreatest ornaments. In the sunshine of his intellect our mind has sunned\r\nitself, and been warmed into zealous and proselyting admiration. To his\r\ngray-haired teachings we have paid personal reverence, and we unaffectedly\r\nhope to have caught from his society and intercourse a spark of that\r\nprofessional enthusiasm which is the only true guiding-star of the\r\nplodding lawyer.\r\n\r\nThe December blasts are hoarsely sobbing to-night through Mount Auburn,\r\nthe garden of his mortal repose—the hallowed spot which his eloquence\r\nconsecrated in its origin, and which his religious love in his lifetime\r\nsacredly cherished. The snows of winter and the autumn-woven carpet of\r\nfallen leaves are heaped upon his honored grave, the sodded paths to\r\nwhich, in the glowing spring-time and fragrant summer, are pressed most\r\nfrequent with the tread of faithful mourners. Years have passed since that\r\nhonored grave was first closed upon him. Longer years have flown since we\r\nwere under his teachings. But we seem to view him the same as of yore.\r\nAgain the class is assembled in the hushed lecture-room as his familiar\r\ntread is heard at the door; or as the burst of applause, where there is no\r\nsycophantic flattery known or felt, greets his entrance to his seat. Again\r\nwe see him adjusting his genial spectacles, and looking around upon the\r\nupturned faces with parental pride. Again we hear his mellowed, although\r\noften impetuous accents, expounding familiar principles of law, and\r\ndescending to the consideration of \"first things\" with as much pride and\r\ncarefulness as the artist treats his Rubens or Titian, which for years and\r\nyears has hung before him in all lights and shades and in every\r\ncombination of position.\r\n\r\nAgain, we occupy a modest corner of the library while he is holding his\r\nmoot court; infusing into the dignity of his manner a marked suavity of\r\ndisposition which never forsook him; or he is perpetrating some\r\nappropriate legal joke to his audience, who never played upon his ease or\r\ngood nature.\r\n\r\nAgain, we have stolen into the self-same library while he is holding an\r\nequity term of his circuit, to listen to the words of judicial wisdom\r\nwhich came from his utterance, exuberant as pearls of fancy from the mouth\r\nof an inspired poet.\r\n\r\nAgain, we see him at the summer twilight, seated by the trellised portico\r\nof his hospitable and happy homestead, surrounded by family or friends,\r\nenjoying the amenities of life with unaffected pleasure, and sometimes\r\nawakening the garden echoes with his cheerful ringing laugh; or we see him\r\nin the same hour of the day driving under the venerable elms of the\r\nnumerous commons, gazing and bowing around with all the pleasure which the\r\nking of the fairy book marked upon his face when the love of his subjects,\r\namong whom he passed, came forth with the evening breeze to bless and\r\ngreet him.\r\n\r\nAnd then we pass into \"reverie,\" and live a few minutes of \"dream-life,\"\r\nrecalling to mind the maxims and sayings which were uttered in our\r\npresence; and the many bright exemplars placed before his pupils, and the\r\nkindly greetings which were showered all about—for he was no distinguisher\r\nof persons so long as honor of feeling and uprightness of motive abounded\r\nin his presence.\r\n\r\nHe is gone! Yet in these pages of biography before us he will always live.\r\nFrom infancy to the ripened greatness of old age, his life is preserved to\r\nposterity by the hand of his faithful and grateful son, whose duty has\r\nbeen most ably and interestingly performed. The very minutiæ of his life\r\nare presented with fidelity and modesty of reference. Some may carp at\r\nthis; to these let us say with the French proverbialist, _Rien n’est\r\nindifférent dans la vie d’un grand homme; le genie se revéle dans ses\r\nmoindres actions_. The straws of every day life mark the direction of the\r\nbreezes of individual action.\r\n\r\nTo the hearts of his pupils we would send this epitaph, and ask them if\r\naught less tributary could be said of one who was and is to them a father.\r\n\r\nHere sleeps the mortality of Joseph Story, who lived his days so well that\r\nhe won in a short lifetime an immortality of fame. His career as a _Man_\r\nreflected lustre upon the lustre of an honored father’s manhood, and added\r\nto the virtues which his mother bequeathed him. As a _Politician_, he\r\nrendered obeisance only to his conscience. As a _Lawyer_, he never\r\ndisgraced his profession by a thought, and even honored it by his\r\nslightest acts. The colleague of Marshall, the two now shine together as\r\ntwin stars in the often contemplated firmament of _Judicial Renown_. Not\r\nselfish of his _Learning_, it is scattered to the uttermost parts of the\r\nearth, and is treasured wherever it has fallen. The learning which he\r\nborrowed from continental Europe he repaid with magnificent interest. In\r\nWestminster Hall his name is associated with Nottingham, Hale, Mansfield,\r\nand Stowell. Counting as dross the wealth of professional eminence, he\r\nbecame from the love of it an expounder of law to its tyros. He has spread\r\nfor thousands of adopted children a banquet of the treasures of legal\r\nlore, and next to reverencing his paternal love they cherish with profound\r\ngratitude the memory of his slightest instructions. While the Union of his\r\nbirthplace exists, her citizens will regard with unfeigned admiration his\r\nconstitutional teachings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLUMBUS AT THE GATES OF GENOA.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  WRITTEN FOR THE INTERNATIONAL MAGAZINE\r\n\r\n\r\nBY THE AUTHOR OF \"NILE NOTES OF A HOWADJI.\"\r\n\r\nChristopher Columbus was born at Genoa in 1437.

She had\r\nthrust it there after filling it with tobacco, but without stooping to\r\nlight it at the hearth; where, indeed, there was no appearance of a fire\r\nhaving been kindled, that morning. Forthwith, however, as soon as the\r\norder was given, there was an intense red glow out of the bowl of the\r\npipe, and a whiff of smoke from Mother Rigby’s lips. Whence the coal came,\r\nand how brought thither by an invisible hand, I have never been able to\r\ndiscover.\r\n\r\n\"Good!\" quoth Mother Rigby, with a nod of her head. \"Thank ye, Dickon! And\r\nnow for making this scarecrow. Be within call, Dickon, in case I need you\r\nagain!\"\r\n\r\nThe good woman had risen thus early (for as yet it was scarcely sunrise),\r\nin order to set about making a scarecrow, which she intended to put in the\r\nmiddle of her corn patch. It was now the latter week of May, and the crows\r\nand blackbirds had already discovered the little, green, rolled-up leaf of\r\nthe Indian corn, just peeping out of the soil. She was determined,\r\ntherefore, to contrive as lifelike a scarecrow as ever was seen, and to\r\nfinish it immediately, from top to toe, so that it should begin its\r\nsentinel’s duty that very morning. Now, mother Rigby (as every body must\r\nhave heard) was one of the most cunning and potent witches in New England,\r\nand might, with very little trouble, have made a scarecrow ugly enough to\r\nfrighten the minister himself. But, on this occasion, as she had awakened\r\nin an uncommonly pleasant humor, and was further dulcified by her pipe of\r\ntobacco, she resolved to produce something fine, beautiful, and splendid,\r\nrather than hideous and horrible.\r\n\r\n\"I don’t want to set up a hobgoblin in my own corn-patch, and almost at my\r\nown doorstep,\" said Mother Rigby to herself, puffing out a whiff of smoke;\r\n\"I could do it if I pleased; but I’m tired of doing marvellous things, and\r\nso I’ll keep within the bounds of everyday business, just for variety’s\r\nsake. Besides, there is no use in scaring the little children, for a mile\r\nroundabout, though ’tis true I’m a witch!\"\r\n\r\nIt was settled, therefore, in her own mind, that the scarecrow should\r\nrepresent a fine gentleman of the period, so far as the materials at hand\r\nwould allow. Perhaps it may be as well to enumerate the chief of the\r\narticles that went to the composition of this figure.\r\n\r\nThe most important item of all, probably, although it made so little show,\r\nwas a certain broomstick, on which Mother Rigby had taken many an airy\r\ngallop at midnight, and which now served the scarecrow by way of a spinal\r\ncolumn, or, as the unlearned phrase it, a backbone. One of its arms was a\r\ndisabled flail which used to be wielded by Goodman Rigby, before his\r\nspouse worried him out of this troublesome world; the other, if I mistake\r\nnot, was composed of the pudding-stick and a broken rung of a chair, tied\r\nloosely together at the elbow. As for its legs, the right was a\r\nhoe-handle, and the left an undistinguished and miscellaneous stick from\r\nthe wood pile. Its lungs, stomach, and other affairs of that kind, were\r\nnothing better than a meal bag, stuffed with straw. Thus, we have made out\r\nthe skeleton and entire corporcity of the scarecrow, with the exception of\r\nits head; and this was admirably supplied by a somewhat withered and\r\nshrivelled pumpkin, in which Mother Rigby cut two holes for the eyes and a\r\nslit for the mouth, leaving a bluish-colored knob in the middle, to pass\r\nfor a nose. It was really quite a respectable face.\r\n\r\n\"I’ve seen worse ones on human shoulders, at any rate,\" said Mother Rigby.\r\n\"And many a fine gentleman has a pumpkin head, as well as my scarecrow!\"\r\n\r\nBut the clothes, in this case, were to be the making of the man. So the\r\ngood old woman took down from a peg an ancient plum-colored coat, of\r\nLondon make, and with relics of embroidery on its seams, cuffs,\r\npocket-flabs, and button-holes, but lamentably worn and faded, patched at\r\nthe elbows, tattered at the skirts, and threadbare all over. On the left\r\nbreast was a round hole, whence either a star of nobility had been rent\r\naway, or else the hot heart of some former wearer had scorched it through\r\nand through. The neighbors said, that this rich garment belonged to the\r\nBlack Man’s wardrobe, and that he kept it at Mother Rigby’s cottage for\r\nthe convenience of slipping it on whenever he wished to make a grand\r\nappearance at the governor’s table. To match the coat, there was a velvet\r\nwaistcoat of very ample size, and formerly embroidered with foliage, that\r\nhad been as brightly golden as the maple-leaves in October, but which had\r\nnow quite vanished out of the substance of the velvet. Next came a pair of\r\nscarlet breeches, once worn by the French governor of Louisbourg, and the\r\nknees of which had touched the lower step of the throne of Louis le Grand.\r\nThe Frenchman had given these small-clothes to an Indian powwow, who\r\nparted with them to the old witch for a gill of strong waters, at one of\r\ntheir dances in the forest. Furthermore, Mother Rigby produced a pair of\r\nsilk stockings, and put them on the figure’s legs, where they showed as\r\nunsubstantial as a dream, with the wooden reality of the two sticks making\r\nitself miserably apparent through the holes. Lastly, she put her dead\r\nhusband’s wig on the bare scalp of the pumpkin, and surmounted the whole\r\nwith a dusty three-cornered hat, in which was stuck the longest tail\r\nfeather of a rooster.\r\n\r\nThen the old dame stood the figure up in a corner of her cottage, and\r\nchuckled to behold its yellow semblance of a visage, with its nobby little\r\nnose thrust into the air. It had a strangely self-satisfied aspect, and\r\nseemed to say, \"Come look at me!\"\r\n\r\n\"And you are well worth looking at—that’s a fact!\" quoth Mother Rigby, in\r\nadmiration at her own handiwork: \"I’ve made many a puppet, since I’ve been\r\na witch; but methinks this is the finest of them all. ’Tis almost too good\r\nfor a scarecrow. And, by the by, I’ll just fill a fresh pipe of tobacco,\r\nand then take him out to the corn-patch.\"\r\n\r\nWhile filling her pipe, the old woman continued to gaze with almost\r\nmotherly affection at the figure in the corner. To say the truth, whether\r\nit were chance, or skill, or downright witchcraft, there was something\r\nwonderfully human in this ridiculous shape, bedizened with its tattered\r\nfinery; and as for the countenance, it appeared to shrivel its yellow\r\nsurface into a grin—a funny kind of expression, betwixt scorn and\r\nmerriment, as if it understood itself to be a jest at mankind. The more\r\nMother Rigby looked, the better she was pleased.\r\n\r\n\"Dickon,\" cried she sharply, \"another coal for my pipe!\"\r\n\r\nHardly had she spoken than, just as before, there was a red-glowing coal\r\non the top of the tobacco. She drew in a long whiff, and puffed it forth\r\nagain into the bar of morning sunshine, which struggled through the one\r\ndusty pane of her cottage window. Mother Rigby always liked to flavor her\r\npipe with a coal of fire from the particular chimney corner whence this\r\nhad been brought. But where that chimney corner might be, or who brought\r\nthe coal from it—further than that the invisible messenger seemed to\r\nrespond to the name of Dickon—I cannot tell.\r\n\r\n\"That puppet, yonder,\" thought Mother Rigby, still with her eyes fixed on\r\nthe scarecrow, \"is too good a piece of work to stand all summer in a\r\ncorn-patch, frightening away the crows and blackbirds. He’s capable of\r\nbetter things. Why, I’ve danced with a worse one, when partners happened\r\nto be scarce, at our witch-meetings in the forest! What if I should let\r\nhim take his chance among the other men of straw and empty fellows, who go\r\nbustling about the world?\"\r\n\r\nThe old witch took three or four more whiffs of her pipe, and smiled.\r\n\r\n\"He’ll meet plenty of his brethren at every street-corner!\" continued she.\r\n\"Well; I didn’t mean to dabble in witchcraft to-day, further than the\r\nlighting of my pipe; but a witch I am, and a witch I’m likely to be, and\r\nthere’s no use trying to shirk it. I’ll make a man of my scarecrow, were\r\nit only for the joke’s sake!\"\r\n\r\nWhile muttering these words, Mother Rigby took the pipe from her own\r\nmouth, and thrust it into the crevice which represented the same feature\r\nin the pumpkin-visage of the scarecrow.\r\n\r\n\"Puff, darling, puff!\" said she. \"Puff away, my fine fellow! your life\r\ndepends on it!\"\r\n\r\nThis was a strange exhortation, undoubtedly, to be addressed to a mere\r\nthing of sticks, straw, and old clothes, with nothing better than a\r\nshrivelled pumpkin for a head; as we know to have been the scarecrow’s\r\ncase. Nevertheless, as we must carefully hold in remembrance, Mother Rigby\r\nwas a witch of singular power and dexterity; and, keeping this fact duly\r\nbefore our minds, we shall see nothing beyond credibility in the\r\nremarkable incidents of our story. Indeed, the great difficulty will be at\r\nonce got over, if we can only bring ourselves to believe, that, as soon as\r\nthe old dame bade him puff, there came a whiff of smoke from the\r\nscarecrow’s mouth. It was the very feeblest of whiffs, to be sure; but it\r\nwas followed by another and another, each more decided than the preceding\r\none.\r\n\r\n\"Puff away, my pet! puff away, my pretty one!\" Mother Rigby kept\r\nrepeating, with her pleasantest smile. \"It is the breath of life to ye;\r\nand that you may take my word for!\"\r\n\r\nBeyond all question the pipe was bewitched. There must have been a spell\r\neither in the tobacco or in the fiercely glowing coal that so mysteriously\r\nburned on top of it, or in the pungent aromatic smoke which exhaled from\r\nthe kindled weed. The figure, after a few doubtful attempts, at length\r\nblew forth a volley of smoke, extending all the way from the obscure\r\ncorner into the bar of sunshine. There it eddied and melted away among the\r\nmotes of dust. It seemed a convulsive effort; for the two or three next\r\nwhiffs were fainter, although the coal still glowed, and threw a gleam\r\nover the scarecrow’s visage. The old witch clapt her skinny hands\r\ntogether, and smiled encouragingly upon her handiwork. She saw that the\r\ncharm worked well. The shrivelled, yellow face, which heretofore had been\r\nno face at all, had already a thin, fantastic haze, as it were, of human\r\nlikeness, shifting to and fro across it; sometimes vanishing entirely, but\r\ngrowing more perceptible than ever with the next whiff from the pipe. The\r\nwhole figure, in like manner, assumed a show of life, such as we impart to\r\nill-defined shapes among the clouds, and half-deceive ourselves with the\r\npastime of our own fancy.\r\n\r\nIf we must needs pry closely into the matter, it may be doubted whether\r\nthere was any real change, after all, in the sordid, worn-out, worthless,\r\nand ill-jointed substance of the scarecrow; but merely a spectral\r\nillusion, and a cunning effect of light and shade, so colored and\r\ncontrived as to delude the eyes of most men. The miracles of witchcraft\r\nseem always to have had a very shallow subtlety; and, at least, if the\r\nabove explanation do not hit the truth of the process, I can suggest no\r\nbetter.\r\n\r\n\"Well puffed, my pretty lad!\" still cried old Mother Rigby. \"Come, another\r\ngood, stout whiff, and let it be with might and main! Puff for thy life, I\r\ntell thee! Puff out of the very bottom of thy heart; if any heart thou\r\nhast, or any bottom to it! Well done, again! Thou didst suck in that\r\nmouthfull as if for the pure love of it.\"\r\n\r\nAnd then the witch beckoned to the scarecrow, throwing so much magnetic\r\npotency into her gesture, that it seemed as if it must inevitably be\r\nobeyed, like the mystic call of the loadstone, when it summons the iron.\r\n\r\n\"Why lurkest thou in the corner, lazy one?\" said she. \"Step forth! Thou\r\nhast the world before thee?\"\r\n\r\nUpon my word, if the legend were not one which I heard on my grandmother’s\r\nknee, and which had established its place among things credible before my\r\nchildish judgment could analyze its probability, I question whether I\r\nshould have the face to tell it now!\r\n\r\nIn obedience to Mother Rigby’s word, and extending its arm as if to reach\r\nher out-stretched hand, the figure made a step forward—a kind of hitch and\r\njerk, however, rather than a step—then tottered, and almost lost its\r\nbalance. What could the witch expect? It was nothing, after all, but a\r\nscarecrow, stuck upon two sticks. But the strong-willed old beldam\r\nscowled, and beckoned, and flung the energy of her purpose so forcibly at\r\nthis poor combination of rotten wood, and musty straw, and ragged\r\ngarments, that it was compelled to show itself a man, in spite of the\r\nreality of things. So it stepped into the bar of sunshine. There it\r\nstood—poor devil of a contrivance that it was!—with only the thinnest\r\nvesture of human similitude about it, through which was evident the stiff,\r\nricketty, incongruous, faded, tattered, good-for-nothing patchwork of its\r\nsubstance, ready to sink in a heap upon the floor, as conscious of its own\r\nunworthiness to be erect. Shall I confess the truth? At its present point\r\nof vivification, the scarecrow reminds me of some of the lukewarm and\r\nabortive characters, composed of heterogeneous materials, used for the\r\nthousandth time, and never worth using, with which romance-writers (and\r\nmyself, no doubt, among the rest), have so over-peopled the world of\r\nfiction.\r\n\r\nBut the fierce old hag began to get angry, and show a glimpse of her\r\ndiabolic nature (like a snake’s head, peeping with a hiss out of her\r\nbosom,) at this pusillanimous behavior of the thing, which she had taken\r\nthe trouble to put together.\r\n\r\n\"Puff away, wretch!\" cried she, wrathfully. \"Puff, puff, puff, thou thing\r\nof straw and emptiness!—thou rag or two!—thou meal-bag!—thou\r\npumpkin-head!—thou nothing!—where shall I find a name vile enough to call\r\nthee by! Puff, I say, and suck in thy fantastic life along with the smoke;\r\nelse I snatch the pipe from thy mouth, and hurl thee where that red coal\r\ncame from!\"\r\n\r\nThus threatened, the unhappy scarecrow had nothing for it, but to puff\r\naway for dear life. As need was, therefore, it applied itself lustily to\r\nthe pipe, and sent forth such abundant volleys of tobacco-smoke, that the\r\nsmall cottage-kitchen became all vaporous. The one sunbeam struggled\r\nmistily through, and could but imperfectly define the image of the cracked\r\nand dusty window-pane on the opposite wall. Mother Rigby, meanwhile, with\r\none brown arm akimbo, and the other stretched towards the figure, loomed\r\ngrimly amid the obscurity, with such port and expression as when she was\r\nwont to heave a ponderous nightmare on her victims, and stand at the\r\nbedside to enjoy their agony. In fear and trembling did this poor\r\nscarecrow puff. But its efforts, it must be acknowledged, served an\r\nexcellent purpose; for, with each successive whiff, the figure lost more\r\nand more of its dizzy and perplexing tenuity, and seemed to take denser\r\nsubstance. Its very garments, moreover, partook of the magical change, and\r\nshone with the gloss of novelty, and glistened with the skilfully\r\nembroidered gold that had long ago been rent away. And, half-revealed\r\namong the smoke, a yellow visage bent its lustreless eyes on Mother Rigby.\r\n\r\nAt last, the old witch clenched her fist, and shook it at the figure. Not\r\nthat she was positively angry, but merely acting on the principle—perhaps\r\nuntrue, or not the only truth, though as high a one as Mother Rigby could\r\nbe expected to attain—that feeble and torpid natures, being incapable of\r\nbetter inspiration, must be stirred up by fear. But here was the crisis.\r\nShould she fail in what she now sought to effect, it was her ruthless\r\npurpose to scatter the miserable simulacre into its original elements.\r\n\r\n\"Thou hast a man’s aspect,\" said she, sternly. \"Have also the echo and\r\nmockery of a voice! I bid thee speak!\"\r\n\r\nThe scarecrow gasped, struggled, and at length emitted a murmur, which was\r\nso incorporated with its smoky breath that you could scarcely tell whether\r\nit were indeed a voice, or only a whiff of tobacco. Some narrators of this\r\nlegend, hold the opinion, that Mother Rigby’s conjurations, and the\r\nfierceness of her will, had compelled a familiar spirit into the figure,\r\nand that the voice was his.\r\n\r\n\"Mother,\" mumbled the poor stifled voice, \"be not so awful with me! I\r\nwould fain speak; but being without wits, what can I say?\"\r\n\r\n\"Thou canst speak, darling, canst thou?\" cried Mother Rigby, relaxing her\r\ngrim countenance into a smile. \"And what shalt thou say, quoth-a! Say,\r\nindeed! Art thou of the brotherhood of the empty skull, and demandest of\r\nme what thou shalt say? Thou shalt say a thousand things, and saying them\r\na thousand times over, thou shalt still have said nothing! Be not afraid,\r\nI tell thee! When thou comest into the world (whither I purpose sending\r\nthee, forthwith), thou shalt not lack the wherewithal to talk. Talk! Why,\r\nthou shalt babble like a mill-stream, if thou wilt. Thou hast brains\r\nenough for that, I trow!\"\r\n\r\n\"At your service, mother,\" responded the figure.\r\n\r\n\"And that was well said, my pretty one!\" answered Mother Rigby. \"Then thou\r\nspakest like thyself, and meant nothing. Thou shalt have a hundred such\r\nset phrases, and five hundred to the boot of them. And now, darling, I\r\nhave taken so much pains with thee, and thou art so beautiful, that, by my\r\ntroth, I love thee better than any witch’s puppet in the world; and I’ve\r\nmade them of all sorts—clay, wax, straw, sticks, night-fog, morning-mist,\r\nsea-foam, and chimney-smoke! But thou art the very best. So give heed to\r\nwhat I say!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, kind mother,\" said the figure, \"with all my heart!\"\r\n\r\n\"With all thy heart!\" cried the old witch, setting her hands to her sides,\r\nand laughing loudly. \"Thou hast such a pretty way of speaking! With all\r\nthy heart! And thou didst put thy hand to the left side of thy waistcoat,\r\nas if thou really hadst one!\"\r\n\r\nSo now, in high good humor with this fantastic contrivance of hers, Mother\r\nRigby told the scarecrow that it must go and play its part in the great\r\nworld, where not one man in a hundred, she affirmed, was gifted with more\r\nreal substance than itself. And, that he might hold up his head with the\r\nbest of them, she endowed him, on the spot, with an unreckonable amount of\r\nwealth. It consisted partly of a gold mine in Eldorado, and of ten\r\nthousand shares in a broken bubble, and of half a million acres of\r\nvineyard at the North Pole, and of a castle in the air and a chateau in\r\nSpain, together with all the rents and income therefrom accruing. She\r\nfurther made over to him the cargo of a certain ship, laden with salt of\r\nCadiz, which she herself, by her necromantic arts, had caused to founder,\r\nten years before, in the deepest part of mid-ocean. If the salt were not\r\ndissolved, and could be brought to market, it would fetch a pretty penny\r\namong the fishermen. That he might not lack ready money, she gave him a\r\ncopper farthing, of Birmingham manufacture, being all the coin she had\r\nabout her, and likewise a great deal of brass, which she applied to his\r\nforehead, thus making it yellower than ever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSMILES AND TEARS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 WRITTEN FOR THE INTERNATIONAL MAGAZINE,\r\n\r\n\r\nBY RICHARD COE.\r\n\r\n  \"Art thou happy, little child,\r\n    On this clear bright summer’s day,\r\n  In the garden sporting wild,\r\n    Art thou happy? tell me, pray!\"\r\n  \"If I had that pretty thing,\r\n    That has flown to yonder tree,\r\n  I would laugh, and dance, and sing—\r\n    Oh! how happy I should be!\"\r\n  Then I caught the butterfly,\r\n    Placed it in his hands securely,\r\n  Now, methought, his pretty eye\r\n    Never more will look demurely!\r\n  \"Art thou happy, now?\" said I,\r\n  Tears were sparkling in his eye;\r\n  Lo! the butterfly was dead—\r\n  In his hands its life had sped!\r\n\r\n  \"Art thou happy, maiden fair,\r\n    On this long, bright summer’s day,\r\n  Culling flowerets so rare,\r\n    Art thou happy? tell me, pray!\"\r\n  \"If my Henry were but here,\r\n    To enjoy the scene with me;\r\n  He whose love is so sincere,\r\n    Oh! how happy I should be!\"\r\n  Soon I heard her lover’s feet,\r\n    Sounding on the gravel lightly,\r\n  To his loving words so sweet,\r\n    Tender glances answered brightly!\r\n  \"Art thou happy, now?\" I said,\r\n  Down she hung her lovely head,\r\n  Henry leaves for foreign skies—\r\n  Tears were in the maiden’s eyes!\r\n\r\n  \"Art thou happy, mother mild,\r\n    On this bright, bright summer’s day,\r\n  Gazing on thy cherub child,\r\n    Art thou happy? tell me, pray!\"\r\n  \"If my baby-boy were well,\"\r\n    Thus the mother spake to me,\r\n  \"Gratitude my heart would swell—\r\n    Oh! how happy I should be!\"\r\n  Then the cordial I supplied,\r\n    Soon the babe restored completely;\r\n  Cherub-faced and angel-eyed,\r\n    On his mother smiled he sweetly!\r\n  \"Art thou happy, now?\" I said;\r\n  \"Would his father were not dead!\"\r\n  Thus she answered me with sighs,\r\n  Scalding tear-drops in her eyes!\r\n\r\n  \"Art thou happy, aged man,\r\n    On this glorious summer’s day,\r\n  With a cheek all pale and wan,\r\n    Art thou happy? tell me, pray!\"\r\n  \"If I were but safe above,\"\r\n    Spake the old man unto me,\r\n  \"To enjoy my Saviour’s love,\r\n    Oh! how happy I should be!\"\r\n  Then the angel Death came down,\r\n    And he welcomed him with gladness,\r\n  On his brow so pale and wan,\r\n    Not a trace was seen of sadness:\r\n  \"Art thou happy, now?\" I said;\r\n  \"Yes!\" he answered with his head;\r\n  Tears of joy were in his eyes,\r\n  Dew-drops from the upper skies!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFREEDOM OF THOUGHT AND THE LATEST MIRACLES.\r\n\r\n\r\nArchbishop Hughes, in a late speech attempted an exposition of the\r\nrelations between the Roman Catholic Church and Liberty, with special\r\nreference to the position assumed by him and other prelates, that the\r\nRoman Catholics are, not less than Protestants, upholders of freedom in\r\nopinion and in discussion. The interesting brochure of his Grace will be\r\nbetter appreciated by our readers, perhaps, if we mention a few recent\r\nfacts illustrative of the subject, as it affects \"authors and books.\" The\r\nFrench Roman Catholic Bishop of Lucan has a pastoral in the _Univers_\r\ncondemning Walter Scott’s works, without exception. He does the same by\r\nChateaubriand, and the _Arabian Nights_, and _Don Quixote_—the first as\r\nProtestant, the second as insufficiently Catholic, the third as no\r\nChristian, the fourth as of no religion at all. One unhappy writer of\r\nschool-books is condemned because he cites Guizot and Thierry; another\r\nbecause he blames the massacres of Saint Bartholomew, and thinks they were\r\ncaused by \"religious fanaticism.\" But first of all, and more than all, the\r\nbishop condemns \"that irreligious\" Parisian journal, _La Presse_. \"The\r\nnumber of its subscribers is deplorable; but they are becoming and shall\r\nbecome less; no priest must subscribe to it. No priest must be seen with\r\nit. No priest must ’ordinarily’ read it.\" This is all very proper,\r\naccording to antecedents, but we should not like it if Bishop Hughes\r\ndeprived us of the _Tribune_, the _Herald_, or the _Journal of Commerce_,\r\nall of which are as bad, in the same way, as the _Presse_. Another example\r\nof the prohibition of books, we add from the cyclic letter just issued by\r\nCardinal Lambruschini, condemning Professor Nuytz’s works on\r\necclesiastical law:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"And further, although we derive great consolation from the\r\n    promise of Jesus Christ, that the gates of hell shall never\r\n    prevail against the Church, our soul cannot but feel excruciating\r\n    pain, upon considering how daring outrages against divine and\r\n    sacred things daily flow from the unbridled licentiousness, the\r\n    perverse effrontery and impiety of the press. Now in this\r\n    pestilence of corrupt books which invades us on all sides, the\r\n    work entitled _Institutes of Ecclesiastical Law_, by John Nepomue\r\n    Nuytz, Professor in the Royal University of Turin, as also the\r\n    work entitled _Essays on Ecclesiastical Law_, by the same author,\r\n    claim a conspicuous place, inasmuch as the doctrines contained in\r\n    the said nefarious works are so widely disseminated from one of\r\n    the chairs of that university, that uncatholic theses selected\r\n    from them are proposed as fit subjects for discussion to\r\n    candidates aspiring to the doctor’s degree. For in the above\r\n    mentioned works and essays, such errors are taught under the\r\n    semblance of asserting the rights of the priesthood and of the\r\n    secular power, that instead of sound doctrines, thoroughly\r\n    poisoned cups are offered to youth. For the said author hath not\r\n    blushed to reproduce under a new form, in his impious propositions\r\n    and comments, all those doctrines which have been condemned by\r\n    John II., Benedict XIV., Pius VI., and Gregory XVL., as well as by\r\n    the decrees of the fourth Council of Lateran, and those of\r\n    Florence and Trent. _He openly asserts for example, that the\r\n    Church has no right to enforce her authority by might, and that\r\n    has no temporal power whatever, whether direct or indirect._\"\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the latest miracles is described is the Paris _Univers_, as\r\nfollows—in the most perfect good faith:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"There is much talk at Rome of an extraordinary cure which has\r\n    taken a place in the very palace of the Vatican. The following is\r\n    the manner in which this prodigious fact is described,—which will,\r\n    without doubt, become the subject of a judicial inquiry: ’A young\r\n    girl of about twenty years of age, whose family is employed in the\r\n    domestic side of the palace, had contracted a bad fever, owing to\r\n    the loss of her father a little time before, as well as to the\r\n    influence of the season, which has multiplied at Rome diseases of\r\n    this kind, and by which a great number of victims have fallen\r\n    within the last few months. Notwithstanding the enlightened\r\n    efforts of the doctor of the Pontifical ’family,’ and of her\r\n    parents, the young invalid was soon at the last extremity. The\r\n    vice-curé of the palace (which, as is known, is a foundation), a\r\n    member of the Augustin order (Monseigneur the Sacristan of the\r\n    same order is the titular curé), had administered to her the\r\n    sacrament of extreme unction, and had recited the prayer\r\n    recommending her soul. Her last sigh was hourly expected. For the\r\n    sake of enabling our readers to understand the prodigy about to be\r\n    related, it is necessary to state that during the course of the\r\n    malady the vice-curé had several times engaged the pious patient\r\n    to invoke the aid of a venerable servant of God, of the Augustin\r\n    order, whose beatification is about to be declared, and he had\r\n    even mixed in the potions given to such girl some little fragments\r\n    of the clothes of the venerable man. On the other hand, according\r\n    to the usage of religious families, they had carried into the\r\n    chamber of the dying person the Santo-Bambino del’Ara Cœli,\r\n    demanding of these last resources of the faithful a cure no longer\r\n    in the reach of human science to bestow. Let us return to the bed\r\n    of the dying girl, whom we find in a profound sleep, from which\r\n    she shall soon awaken to relate with smiles on her lips how she\r\n    had seen the infant Jesus, having at his side a venerable servant\r\n    of God, clad in the habit of the order of St. Augustin. She adds\r\n    that she feels herself cured, but very weak, and she asks for a\r\n    cup of broth to give her strength. The broth is given, to her,\r\n    although the request is regarded as coming from one in the last\r\n    agitation of dying; but the sick girl, who had felt the action of\r\n    grace, and who knew well that she was cured, rises, throws off all\r\n    the blisters, of which not a trace was left on her body, and on\r\n    the following day repaired to the church of Ara Cœli, at more than\r\n    half a league distant, to thank the Santo Bambino and the servant\r\n    of God, who had restored her to life and health. You may easily\r\n    comprehend the sensation that a fact of this kind must have\r\n    produced upon a population so full of faith, especially on the eve\r\n    of the ceremony of the 21st, which will put solemnly upon the\r\n    altar, in placing him among the blest, the venerable Father\r\n    Clavier, of the Society of Jesus, and at the close of the\r\n    expiatory _triduo_ which has been celebrated at Saint Andre della\r\n    Valle in reparation of a sacrilegious outrage committed against\r\n    the Madonna du Vicolo dell’ Abate Luigi.’\"\r\n\r\n\r\nOf course the girl never was ill at all.\r\n\r\nMiraculous agencies, it appears, have been applied to by the highest\r\npowers at Rome, with the purpose which actuates the old ladies who study\r\nZadkiel. A young peasant girl living at Sezza, near the Neapolitan\r\nfrontier, has been for some time in a kind of ecstatic, or, as\r\nnon-believers in miracles would call it, magnetic state, and in that part\r\nof the province of Marittima and Campagna, is already known under the\r\ndenomination of St. Catherine. Her fame seems to have originated in a\r\nmiracle which she worked some time ago on the person of an old woman, who\r\ncame to her in great distress because her daughter had died in childbed,\r\nleaving the grandmother of the infant without pecuniary means for its\r\nsupport. \"St. Catherine\" is said to have directed the old woman to suckle\r\nthe baby herself, assuring her that, before she reached home, she would\r\nfind herself in a condition to do so—a direction which the venerable\r\napplicant strictly obeyed, and found her hopes realized! Other\r\nsupernatural answers were subsequently given by the saint to various\r\napplications of the neighboring peasantry, and stolen fowls and stray\r\ncattle were recovered by her indications. But the concourse of people at\r\nlast grew so great that that the ecclesiastical authorities interfered in\r\nbehalf of the sybil, whom they placed in safety and repose within the\r\nwalls of a convent, prohibiting, at the same time, any one from coming to\r\nconsult her without the express permission of the bishop:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"From the accounts of dispassionate spectators,\" writes the\r\n    correspondent of the _Daily News_, \"I am led to infer that there\r\n    is really something extraordinary in the mental or physical\r\n    organization of this young girl, as she alternates between a\r\n    dormant state, resembling magnetic sleep, and a strong degree of\r\n    hysterical or nervous excitability; but whatever may be the real\r\n    cause of the second sight or preternatural knowledge which she\r\n    has, according to public rumor, so frequently displayed, it is\r\n    certain that many persons of this city, including ecclesiastics of\r\n    high rank, have profited by the opportunity of getting a peep into\r\n    the future, and knowing betimes what they have to prepare for.\r\n    Cardinals Lambruschini and Franzoni and the Duke Don Marino\r\n    Torlonia are amongst the number of distinguished individuals who\r\n    have applied to this modern oracle. The advocate Zaccaleoni,\r\n    Monseigneur Appoloni, and many prelates have followed their\r\n    example; indeed, the surprising replies and alarming prognostics\r\n    of the Pythoness so far roused the fears and curiosity of the Pope\r\n    himself, that he caused her to be sent for from the convent at\r\n    Sezza, and brought to Rome, a few days ago, in the carriage of a\r\n    respectable and religious couple, who went there for that express\r\n    purpose. An interview took place between Pio Nono and the\r\n    prophetess, immediately after which she was sent back to her\r\n    retirement. The result of the interview has not transpired, but\r\n    the girl’s revelations were probably similar to those with which\r\n    she has already excited the terrors of her exalted applicants;\r\n    namely, predictions of imminent and sanguinary disturbances, in\r\n    which, though not of long duration, many persons will fall victims\r\n    to popular fury.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Bolognese paper, _Vero Amico_, which is thoroughly devoted to the\r\necclesiastical cause, occasionally devotes some of its columns to war in\r\nfavor of miracles, especially as wrought by images. The following is its\r\naccount of a recent miraculous change of the weather at the intercession\r\nof the Virgin:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"The inhabitants of Tossignano not long ago obtained a new\r\n    demonstration of love and favor from the prodigious image of the\r\n    most Holy Mary, from that extremely ancient image which, saved\r\n    from iconoclastic fury, always engaged the devout worship of their\r\n    ancestors; and which their not degenerate descendants keep as a\r\n    noble and precious heirloom of their hereditary religion, finding\r\n    in it all comfort and support against public and private\r\n    calamities. The late incessant and unseasonable rains having\r\n    hindered the gathering in of autumn fruits, and impeded\r\n    cultivation for the coming year, the active pastor, the very\r\n    revered arch-priest Agnoli, in order to avert so heavy a calamity,\r\n    called the inhabitants of Tossignano together, and with eloquent\r\n    and touching words brought them before the most prodigious image,\r\n    so that, by the intercession of the Virgin, God might restore\r\n    serene weather. For this purpose, on the 7th of October, the flock\r\n    and their beloved pastor met to depose their humble supplications\r\n    at the foot of the altar, sacred to their distinguished\r\n    benefactress; at the first prayer, whilst the pastor was offering\r\n    the propitiatory wafer, a ray of sun gladdened the sacred temple,\r\n    like a rainbow of peace smiling on the assembled faithful, and in\r\n    a few hours all appearance of clouds vanished from the sky! The\r\n    Tossignanesi rightly attributing this to the peculiar favor of\r\n    their protectress, and full of gratitude to her, resolved to\r\n    sanctify the 12th inst. by solemn acts of thanksgiving.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThese poor absurdities, so suggestive of pity and contempt, may he\r\ncompared with the tricks of Rochester knockers and travelling mountebanks\r\ngenerally in this country, and no \"authority of the church\" can raise\r\nthem, in the minds of sensible men, to a higher respectability.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SONG QUEEN.\r\n\r\n\r\nOur excellent friend JAMES T.

Servitors\r\nran hither and thither, the tire-maidens stood in groups to gossip with\r\neach other, messengers were dispatched in various directions, and skilful\r\nleeches and experienced nurses were brought in. Then came a long silence.\r\nVoices were hushed, and footsteps muffled; the apartments of the countess\r\nwere darkened, and nought was heard save the issued whisper, or the\r\nstealthy tread of the sick chamber. The Lady Adelaide was ill. Hours\r\nelapsed—hours of intolerable suspense to the Lord of Visinara; and then\r\nwere heard deep, heartfelt congratulations; but they were spoken in a\r\nwhisper, for the lady was still in danger, and had suffered almost unto\r\ndeath. There was born an heir to Visinara. And as Giovanni, Count of\r\nVisinara, bent over his child, and embraced his young wife, he felt repaid\r\nfor all he had suffered in voluntarily severing himself from Gina Montani;\r\nand from that time he forgot her, or something very like it. And for this\r\nhe could not be condemned, for it was in the line of honor and of duty.\r\nYet it was another proof, if one were wanting, of the fickle nature of\r\nman’s love. It has been well compared to words written on the sands. Many\r\nweeks elapsed ere the Lady Adelaide was convalescent; and some more before\r\nshe ventured to join in the gayeties and festal meetings of the land. A\r\ntwo days’ _fête_, given at the Capella Palace, was the signal for her\r\nreappearance in the world. It was to be of great magnificence, rumor ran,\r\nand the Lady Adelaide consented to attend it early on the morning of the\r\nsecond day. She placed herself in front of the large mirror in her\r\ndressing-chamber while she was prepared for the visit, the same mirror\r\nbefore which she had sat on the evening of her wedding-day. The Signora\r\nLucrezia and Gina were alone present. The former was arranging her rich\r\ntresses, whilst Gina handed the signora what things she required—combs,\r\nand the like. Whilst thus engaged, the count entered, dressed.\r\n\r\n\"Giovanni,\" exclaimed Adelaide, \"Lucrezia thinks that I should wear\r\nsomething in my hair—a wreath, or my diamond coronet; but I feel tired\r\nalready, and wish the dressing was over. Need I be teased with ornaments?\"\r\n\r\n\"My sweet wife, wear what you best like. _You_ need no superficial\r\nadorning.\"\r\n\r\n\"You hear, Lucrezia: make haste and finish my hair. Do not put it in curls\r\nto-day; braids are less trouble, and sooner done. You may put aside the\r\ndiamond casket, Gina. Oh, there’s my darling!\" continued the countess,\r\nhearing the baby pass the door with its nurse. \"Call him in.\" The count\r\nhimself advanced, opened the door, and took his infant. \"The precious,\r\nprecious child!\" exclaimed Adelaide, bending over the infant, which he\r\nplaced on her knees. \"Giovanni,\" she added, looking up eagerly to her\r\nhusband’s face, \"do you think there ever was so lovely a babe sent on\r\nearth?\"\r\n\r\nHe smiled at her earnestness—men are never so rapturously blind in the\r\nworship of their first-born as women. But he stooped down, and fondly\r\npressed his lips upon her forehead, while he played with the little hand\r\nof the infant; and she yielded to the temptation of suffering her face to\r\nrest close to his.\r\n\r\n\"But it grows late,\" resumed the young mother, \"and I suppose we ought to\r\nbe going. Take the baby to its nurse, Lucrezia,\" she continued, kissing it\r\nfifty times as she resigned it.\r\n\r\nThe count had drawn behind the Lady Adelaide, where stood Gina. As his\r\neyes happened to fall upon her, he was struck by the pallid sorrow which\r\nsat in her countenance. Ill-fated Gina! and he had been so absorbed these\r\nlast few weeks in his new happiness! A rush of pity, mingled perhaps with\r\nself-reproach, flew to his heart. What compensation could he offer her? In\r\nthat moment he remembered her last words at the interview in his wife’s\r\nembroidery-room, and gave her _a look_. It was not to be mistaken.\r\nLove—love, pure and tender—gleamed from his eyes, and she answered him\r\nwith a smile which told of her thanks, and that he was perfectly\r\nunderstood. Had any one been looking on, they could scarcely fail to\r\nbecome aware of their existing passion, and that there was a secret\r\nunderstanding between them.\r\n\r\n_And one was looking on._ The Lady Adelaide’s back was towards them, but\r\nin the large glass before her she had distinctly seen the reflection of\r\nall that took place. Her countenance became white as death, and her anger\r\nwas terrible. \"You may retire for the present,\" she said, in a calm,\r\nsubdued tone, to the startled Gina, upon whose mind flashed somewhat of\r\nthe truth; \"and tell the Signora Lucrezia not to return until I call for\r\nher.\"\r\n\r\nTo describe the scene that ensued would be difficult. The shock to the\r\nyoung wife’s feelings had been very great. That her husband was faithless\r\nto her, not only in deed but in heart, she doubted not. It was in vain he\r\nendeavored to explain all; she listened to him not. She thought he was\r\nuttering falsehoods, which but increased his treachery. Gina had once\r\nspoken of her fierce jealousy, but what was hers compared with the Lady\r\nAdelaide’s? In the midst of her explosions of passion, Lucrezia, who had\r\neither not received, or misunderstood, her lady’s message by Gina,\r\nentered. The maiden stood aghast, till, admonished by a haughty wave of\r\nthe hand from the count, she hastened from the room. Later in the day, the\r\nLord of Visinara quitted the castle, to pay the promised visit. His wife\r\nrefused to go. \"Mercy! mercy!\" she exclaimed, in anguish, as she sat alone\r\nin her apartments, \"to be thus requited by Giovanni—whom I so loved, my\r\nhusband! my own husband! Is it possible that a man can be guilty of\r\ntreachery so deep? Would that I had died ere I had known his\r\nfaithlessness, or ever seen him! Shame—shame upon it! to introduce his\r\nparamour into my very presence; an attendant on my person! Holy Virgin,\r\nthat I should be so degraded! Sure a wife, young and beautiful, was never\r\ntreated as I have been. Lowered in the eyes of my own servants; insulted\r\nby him who ought to have guarded me from insult; laughed at—ridiculed by\r\n_her_! Oh! terrible! terrible!\"\r\n\r\nAs she spoke the last words, she rose, and unlocking the bright green\r\ncabinet, that of malachite marble already spoken of, took from thence a\r\nsmall bag of silver gilt. Touching the secret spring of this, she drew\r\nforth a letter, opened, and read it:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"_’To the Lady Adelaide, Countess of Visinara._\r\n\r\n    \"’You fancy yourself the beloved of Giovanni. Count of Visinara;\r\n    but retire not to your rest this night, lady, in any such vain\r\n    imagining. The heart of the count has long been given to another;\r\n    and, you know, by your love for him, that such passion can never\r\n    change its object. Had he met you in earlier life, it might have\r\n    been otherwise. He marries you, for your lineage is a high one;\r\n    and she, in the world’s eye and in that of his own haughty race,\r\n    was no fit mate for him.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Ay,\" she shuddered, \"it is explained now. So, Gina Montani was this\r\nbeloved one. I am his by sufferance—she, by love. Holy Mother, have mercy\r\non my brain! I _know_ they love—I see it all too plainly. And I could\r\nbelieve his deceitful explanation, and trust him. I _told_ him I believed\r\nit on our wedding night. _He did not know why he went to her house; habit,\r\nhe supposed, or, want of occupation._ Oh, shame on his false words! Shame\r\non my own credulity!\"\r\n\r\nNone of us forget the stanzas in Collins’s Ode to the Passions:\r\n\r\n  \"Thy numbers, Jealousy, to nought were fixed,\r\n    Sad proof of thy distressful state:\r\n  Of differing themes the veering song was mixed,\r\n    And now it courted love—now, raving, calling on hate.\"\r\n\r\nAnd calling, indeed, upon hate, as she strode her chamber in a frenzy near\r\nakin to madness, was the lady Adelaide, when her attendant, Lucrezia,\r\nentered.\r\n\r\n\"My dear lady,\" she exclaimed, bursting into tears, as any crocodile might\r\ndo—\"my dear, dear young lady, I cannot know that you are thus suffering,\r\nand keep away from your presence. Pardon me for intruding upon you against\r\norders.\"\r\n\r\nThe Lady Adelaide smoothed her brow, and the lines of her face resumed\r\ntheir haughtiness, as she imperiously ordered Lucrezia to quit the room.\r\nThe heart most awake to the miseries of life wears to the world the\r\ncoldest surface; and it was not in the Lady Adelaide’s nature to betray\r\naught of her emotions to any living being, save, perhaps, her husband.\r\n\r\n\"Nay, my lady, suffer me to remain yet a a moment: at least, while I\r\ndisclose what I know of that viper.\"\r\n\r\nThe Lady Adelaide started; but she suppressed all excitement, and Lucrezia\r\nbegan her tale—an exaggerated account of the interview she had been a\r\nwitness to between the Lord of Visinara and Gina Montani. The countess\r\nlistened to its conclusion, and a low moan escaped her.\r\n\r\n\"What think you now, madam, she deserves?\"\r\n\r\n\"_To die!_\" burst from the pale lips of the unhappy lady.\r\n\r\n\"To die,\" acquiesced Lucrezia, calmly. \"No other punishment would meet her\r\nguilt; and no other, that I am aware of, could be devised to prevent it\r\nfor the future.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! tempt me not,\" cried the lady, wringing her hands. \"I spoke hastily.\"\r\n\r\n\"Give but the orders, madam,\" resumed Lucrezia, \"and they shall be put in\r\npractice.\"\r\n\r\n\"How can I?\" demanded the Lady Adelaide, once more pacing the room in her\r\nanguish; \"how could I ever rest afterwards, with the guilt of murder upon\r\nmy soul?\"\r\n\r\n\"It will be no guilt, lady.\"\r\n\r\n\"Lucrezia!\"\r\n\r\n\"I have made it my business to inquire much about this girl—to ascertain\r\nher history. I thought it my duty, and very soon I should have laid the\r\nwhole matter before you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well?\"\r\n\r\n\"You may destroy her, madam, as you would destroy that little bird there\r\nin its golden cage, without sin and without compunction.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Lucrezia, Lucrezia! once more I say unto thee, tempt me not. Wicked\r\nand artful as she is, she is still one of God’s creatures.\"\r\n\r\n\"Scarcely, my lady,\" answered Lucrezia, with a gesture which spoke of deep\r\nscorn for the culprit. \"I have cause to believe—good cause,\" she repeated,\r\nlowering her voice, and looking round, as if she feared the very walls\r\nmight hear the fearful words she was about to utter, \"that she is one of\r\nthose lost creatures who are enemies to the Universal Faith, a descendant\r\nof the Saxons, and an apostate; as too many of that race have become.\"\r\n\r\n\"_What_ say you?\" gasped the Lady Adelaide.\r\n\r\n\"That we have been harboring a heretic, madam,\" continued Lucrezia, her\r\npassion rising; \"a spy, it may be, upon our holy ceremonies. No wonder\r\nthat evil has fallen upon this house.\"\r\n\r\n\"Go to the cell of Father Anselmo,\" shivered the Lady Adelaide, her teeth\r\nchattering with horror, \"and pray his holiness to step hither: this\r\nfearful doubt shall at once be set at rest.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\n\r\nGina Montani, her head aching with suspense and anxiety, was shut up alone\r\nin her chamber when she received a summons to the apartments of her\r\nmistress. Obeying at once, she found the confessor, Father Anselmo,\r\nsitting there, by the side of the countess. The monk cast his eyes\r\nsteadfastly upon Gina, as if examining her features. \"Never, my daughter,\r\nnever!\" he said, at length, turning to the countess. \"I can take upon\r\nmyself to assert that this damsel of thine has never once appeared before\r\nme to be shriven.\"\r\n\r\n\"Examine her,\" was the reply of the lady.\r\n\r\n\"Daughter,\" said the priest, turning to Gina, \"for so I would fain call\r\nthee, until assured that thou canst have no claim to the title, what faith\r\nis it that thou professest.\"\r\n\r\nGina raised her hand to her burning temples. She saw that all was\r\ndiscovered. But when she removed it, the perplexity in her face had\r\ncleared away, and her resolution was taken. \"The truth, the truth,\" she\r\nmurmured; \"for good, or for ill, I will tell it now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hearest thou not?\" inquired the priest, somewhat more sternly. \"Art thou\r\na child of the True Faith?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am not a Roman Catholic,\" she answered, timidly, \"if you call that\r\nfaith the true one.\"\r\n\r\nThe Lady Adelaide and the priest crossed themselves simultaneously, whilst\r\nGina grasped the arm of the chair against which she was standing. She was\r\nendeavoring to steel her heart to bravery; but in those days, and in that\r\ncountry, such a scene was a terrible ordeal.\r\n\r\n\"Dost thou not worship the One True God,\" continued the priest, \"and\r\nacknowledge his Holiness, our Father at Rome, to be His sole\r\nrepresentative here?\"\r\n\r\n\"I worship the One True God,\" replied Gina, solemnly, joining her hands in\r\na reverent attitude; \"but for the Pope at Rome, I know him not.\"\r\n\r\nThe Lady Adelaide shrieked with aversion and terror, and the pale face of\r\nthe monk became glowing with the crimson of indignation. \"Knowest thou\r\nnot,\" he said, \"that to the Pope it is given to mediate between earth and\r\nheaven?\"\r\n\r\n\"I know,\" faltered Gina, shrinking at the monk’s looks and tone, yet still\r\ncourageous for the truth, \"that there is One Mediator between God and\r\nman.\"\r\n\r\n\"And he—?\"\r\n\r\n\"Our Saviour.\"\r\n\r\n\"Miserable heretic!\" scowled the monk, \"hast thou yet to learn that of all\r\nthe living souls this world contains, not one can enter the fold of Heaven\r\nwithout the sanction of our Holy Father, the Pope?\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall never learn it,\" whispered Gina, \"and to me such doctrines savor\r\nof blasphemy. Therefore, I beseech you, dilate not on them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Lost, miserable wretch!\" cried the priest, lifting his hands in dismay.\r\n\"Need I tell thee, that in the next world there is a place of torture kept\r\nfor such as thee—a gulf of burning flames, never to be extinguished.\r\n\r\n\"We are told there is such a place,\" she answered, struggling with her\r\ntears, for the interview was becoming too painful. \"May the infinite love\r\nand mercy of God keep both you and me from it!\"\r\n\r\n\"Thou art hopeless—hopeless!\" ejaculated the monk, sternly. \"Yet, another\r\nquestion ere I send thee forth. Where hast thou imbibed these deadly\r\ndoctrines?\"\r\n\r\n\"My mother wedded with an Italian,\" answered Gina, \"but she was born on\r\nthe free soil of England, and reared in its Reformed Faith.\"\r\n\r\n\"A benighted land—an accursed land!\" screamed the priest, vehemently; \"the\r\ntime will come when it shall be deluged from one end to the other with its\r\napostates’ blood.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is an enlightened land—a free, blessed land!\" retorted Gina, in\r\nagitation; \"and God’s mercy will rest upon it, and keep it powerful\r\namongst nations, so long as its sons remain true to their Reformed Faith.\"\r\n\r\n\"Insanity has fallen upon them,\" raved the monk, endeavoring to drown the\r\nbold words of Gina,—\"nothing but insanity. But,\" he added, dropping his\r\nvoice, \"let them beware. Quem Deus vult perdere, prius dementat.\"\r\n\r\nGina understood not the tongue; but the Lady Adelaide did, and crossed\r\nherself.\r\n\r\n\"And this mother of thine,\" sneered the monk, turning again to Gina,\r\n\"where may she be?\"\r\n\r\n\"She is dead,\" gasped Gina, bursting into tears.\r\n\r\n\"Good!\" assented the monk; \"then she is meeting with her deserts.\"\r\n\r\n\"God grant she may be!\" aspirated the maiden, \"for she died in the faith\r\nof Christ.\"\r\n\r\n\"And who have been thy worthy instructors since?\" proceeded the priest.\r\n\r\n\"I have had but one guide since,\" answered Gina.\r\n\r\n\"Disclose the name.\"\r\n\r\n\"My Bible.\"\r\n\r\nThe monk uttered what seemed very like a scream of passion, and the Lady\r\nAdelaide, as she heard the words, half rose from her chair.\r\n\r\n\"Be calm, my daughter,\" interrupted the monk, waving his hand towards the\r\ncountess; \"I will guard thee from the harm caused by contact with this\r\nheretical being. Desire her, I pray thee, to fetch this Book hither, that\r\nI may glance at it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Go,\" cried the Lady Adelaide, imperiously, to Gina; \"bring this Bible\r\ninstantly!\"\r\n\r\nGina obeyed, and the sacred volume was placed in the hands of the monk.\r\nThe Lady Adelaide shrank from touching it.\r\n\r\n\"Ha!\" cried the monk, perceiving it to be printed in the English tongue,\r\n\"dost thou speak this language, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is familiar to me as my own,\" replied Gina.\r\n\r\n\"I will summon thy attendants for a light, my daughter,\" he remarked to\r\nthe Lady Adelaide. And when one was brought, the priest advanced to a part\r\nof the room where the marble floor was uncovered by tapestry, and tearing\r\nthe leaves from the Book, he set light to them, till all, both the Old and\r\nNew Testament, were consumed, and the ashes scattered on the ground. \"It\r\nis the most dangerous instructor that can be placed in the hands of the\r\npeople,\" he observed, complacently watching the black mass smouldering\r\nthere. And Gina Montani pressed her hands upon her chest, which was\r\nthrobbing with agitation, but she did not dare to utter a word of\r\nremonstrance.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, father, father!\" cried the Lady Adelaide, sinking at his feet, after\r\nGina had been conducted to her chamber, and giving vent involuntarily to\r\nsobs of agony, \"she has dared to come between me and my husband—he has\r\nknown her long, it seems. If she should have tainted him with this black\r\nheresy?\"\r\n\r\nThe monk turned as white as the lady’s dress at the suggestion. It was\r\nenough to make him. That that docile and faithful servant of the Church,\r\nthe powerful Chief of Visinara, who was ever ready, at only half a hint,\r\nto endow it with valuable offerings and presents—entire robes of point\r\nlace for the Virgin Mary, and flounces and tuckers for all the female\r\nsaints in the calendar, not to speak of his donations in hard cash, and\r\nhis frequent offerings of paintings, most of them representing the popes\r\nworking miracles, particularly that very pious one, Alexander VI.—that\r\n_he_ should have had dissent instilled into him, perhaps even been made\r\nfamiliar with the principles of this upstart creed! Had his reverence\r\nswooned outright, it would have only been what might be expected.\r\n\r\n\"It will not be a crime to remove her, father,\" faltered the Lady\r\nAdelaide.\r\n\r\n\"_Crime_!\" cried the ruffled priest; \"canst thou connect the word—in that\r\nsense—with so degraded a being?\"\r\n\r\n\"To remove her in _any way_,\" persisted the lady, in a whisper. \"Yet the\r\nworld might call it MURDER.\"\r\n\r\n\"No punishment in this world is adequate to her sin,\" answered the monk.\r\n\"And she must not be suffered to remain in it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thou wilt then grant me absolution beforehand, holy father,\" implored the\r\nLady Adelaide.\r\n\r\n\"And what canst thou do, my child?\" resumed the monk, smiling upon the\r\ncountess. \"Thou hast not been used to such work, and wouldst prove a sad\r\nnovice at it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Too true,\" she uttered; \"my heart is trembling now. Indeed, I could think\r\nbut of one way—the moat. And though the order seems easy enough to give, I\r\nfear I should, when the moment came, shrink from issuing it.\"\r\n\r\n\"And who hast thou in this castle that will do thy bidding in secret and\r\nin silence? It were better that this deed were not known: and thou canst\r\nnot stop tongues, my daughter.\"\r\n\r\n\"There are many bound to my interests, who would, I believe, lay down\r\ntheir lives for me,\" deliberated the Lady Adelaide; \"yet, alas! the tongue\r\nis an unruly member, and is apt to give utterance in unguarded moments to\r\nwords against the will.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thou hast reason, my child. I but put the question to try thee. I will\r\nundertake this business for thee. That evil one’s sin has been committed\r\nagainst the Church, and it is fitting that the Church should inflict the\r\npunishment.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thou wilt cause her to be flung into the moat?\" shuddered the Lady\r\nAdelaide.\r\n\r\n\"The moat!\" echoed the priest. \"Thinkest thou, my daughter, that the\r\nChurch is wont to carry out her dealings by ordinary means? Signal as this\r\nwoman’s sin has been, signal must be her expiation.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Can_ it be expiated?\"\r\n\r\n\"Never, either in this world or the next. And every moment of delay that\r\nwe voluntarily make in hurling her to her doom, must draw down wrath on\r\nour own heads from the saints on high.\"\r\n\r\nThe Lady Adelaide meekly bowed _her_ head, as if to deprecate any wrath\r\nthat might just then be falling.\r\n\r\n\"Thy lady in waiting, Lucrezia, is true, I have reason to believe,\"\r\ncontinued the monk.\r\n\r\n\"I believe her to be true,\" answered the Lady Adelaide.\r\n\r\n\"We may want her co-operation,\" he concluded, \"for I opine that thou, my\r\ndaughter, wilt not deign to aid in this; neither do I think thou art\r\nfitted for it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe castle was wrapped in silence, it being past the hour at which the\r\nhousehold retired to repose. Gina Montani was in her nightdress, though as\r\nyet she had not touched her hair, which remained in long curls, as she had\r\nworn it in the day. Suspense and agitation caused her to linger, and she\r\nsat at her dressing-table in a musing attitude, her head resting on her\r\nhand, wondering what would be the ending to all that the day had brought\r\nforth. She had dismissed her attendant some time before. With a deep sigh\r\nshe rose to continue her preparations for rest, when the door softly\r\nopened, and the Signora Lucrezia appeared.\r\n\r\n\"You need not prepare yourself for bed,\" she observed, in a low, distinct\r\nwhisper; \"another sort of bed is preparing for you.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean?\" demanded the startled girl.\r\n\r\n\"That you are this night to die.\"\r\n\r\nGina shrieked.\r\n\r\n\"I may tell you,\" interrupted the lady, \"that screams and resistance will\r\nbe wholly useless. Your doom is irrevocable, therefore it may save you\r\ntrouble to be silent.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are speaking falsely to me. I have done nothing to deserve death.\"\r\n\r\n\"Equivocation will be alike unavailing,\" repeated Lucrezia. \"And if you\r\nask what you have done—you have dared to step with your ill-placed passion\r\nbetween my lord and the Lady Adelaide: you have brought discredit upon the\r\nlong-upheld religion of this house.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have disturbed no one’s faith,\" returned Gina. \"I wish to disturb none.\r\nIt is true that I love Giovanni, Count di Visinara, but I loved him long\r\nere he saw the Lady Adelaide.\"\r\n\r\n\"What!\" cried the signora, her cheeks inflamed, and her brow darkening,\r\n\"do you dare to avow your shame to my face?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is no shame,\" answered Gina, sadly; there is nothing of guilt in such\r\na love as mine.\"\r\n\r\n\"Follow me,\" repeated Lucrezia. \"You have no time to waste in\r\nlamentations.\"\r\n\r\n\"By whose orders do I die?\" demanded the indignant girl. \"Not by _his_;\r\nand no one else has a right to condemn me.\"\r\n\r\nLucrezia expected this, and was prepared. Alas, that the Lord of Visinara\r\nshould that day have left his signet ring behind him!\r\n\r\n\"Do you know this ring!\" demanded Lucrezia, holding out the jewel.\r\n\r\n\"Too well. It is the Count of Visinara’s.\"\r\n\r\n\"You may then know who has condemned you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Giovanni!\" wailed Gina, as she sank prostrate on the floor in her\r\nanguish, \"this from you!\" All idea of resistance vanished with the thought\r\nthat it was him she so loved who doomed her to destruction. \"I thought he\r\nwas still at the Capella Palace,\" she inquired, looking up at Lucrezia, a\r\ndoubt possibly finding its way to her heart. \"When did he return?\"\r\n\r\n\"I came not to waste the moments in idle words,\" returned Lucrezia, as she\r\nprepared to utter the falsehood; \"it is sufficient for you to know that he\r\n_has_ returned, and has given the orders that you seem inclined to\r\nresist.\"\r\n\r\n\"Implore him to come to me for one moment, for a last farewell.\"\r\n\r\n\"I may not ask it. He is with the Lady Adelaide.\"\r\n\r\n\"First, my happiness, then, my life, sacrificed to appease the Lady\r\nAdelaide! Oh, Giovanni! false, but dear Giovanni—\"\r\n\r\n\"I have no orders to call those who will use violence,\" interrupted the\r\nsignora, \"but I must do so if you delay to follow me.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am about to dress myself,\" returned Gina.\r\n\r\n\"The dress you have on will serve as well as another—and better, for a\r\nnight-gown bears some resemblance to a shroud.\"\r\n\r\n\"One moment for prayer,\" was the next imploring petition.\r\n\r\n\"Prayer for you!\" broke contemptuously from the signora.\r\n\r\n\"A single moment for prayer,\" reiterated the victim. \"If I am, indeed,\r\nabout to meet my Maker, I stand awfully in need of it; for I have of late\r\nworshipped but one, but it has not been Him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Prayer for _you_, a _heretic_!\" repeated Lucrezia; \"you may as well offer\r\nit up to blocks of wood or stone. The creed you profess forfeits all\r\ninheritance for you in heaven.\"\r\n\r\nYet still Gina repeated it—\"A few moments for prayer, in mercy!\"\r\n\r\n\"Then pray away where you are going,\" returned Lucrezia, impatiently. \"You\r\nwill have time enough, and to spare—minutes, and hours, and days,\r\nperhaps.\"\r\n\r\nThe signora evidently took a savage pleasure in urging on the death of\r\nGina Montani. What could be the reason? Women in general are not so\r\nfrightfully cruel. The motive was, that she herself loved the count. As\r\nBianca had said, when watching the bridal cavalcade, could any be brought\r\ninto daily contact with one so attractive and not learn to love him? so it\r\nhad proved with Lucrezia. Being the favorite attendant of her mistress,\r\nshe was much with her, and consequently daily and frequently in the\r\ncompany of Giovanni. He had many a gay word and passing jest for her, for\r\nhe was by nature a gallant, free-spoken man; and this had its effect.\r\nWhilst he never glanced a thought towards her but as one necessary to wait\r\nupon his wife, he became to her heart dangerously dear; and excessively\r\njealous had she been of Gina ever since she had heard the conversation in\r\nthe embroidery-room. Pushing the unfortunate girl on before her, Lucrezia\r\nsilently passed from Gina’s bed-chamber to the secret passages, plenty of\r\nwhich might be found in the castle. She bore a lantern in her hand, which\r\nemitted a dim, uncertain light. At length they came to a passage, a little\r\nbeyond the chapel, far removed from the habited apartments; and in the\r\nmiddle of this were two male forms, busily occupied at work of some\r\ndescription. A lantern, similar to the one Lucrezia carried, was hanging\r\nhigh up against the opposite wall; another stood on the ground. Gina\r\nstopped and shivered, but Lucrezia touched her arm, and she walked on.\r\nThey were nearing the men, who were habited as monks, and their faces\r\nshielded beneath their cowls, when the signora halted and pressed her hand\r\nupon her brow, as if in thought. Presently she turned to Gina. A second\r\nlie was in her mouth; but how was the ill-fated young lady to know it?\r\n\"_He_ sent you a message,\" she whispered. \"It is his last request to you.\r\nWill you receive it?\" The unhappy victim looked up eagerly.\r\n\r\n\"He requests, then, by his love for you—by the remembrance of the happy\r\nmoments you once spent together, that you neither resist nor scream.\"\r\n\r\nHer heart was too full to speak; but she bowed her head in acquiescence.\r\nLucrezia moved to go on. \"How is my life to be taken? By the dagger? By\r\nblows?\"\r\n\r\n\"By neither—by nothing. Not a hair of your head will be touched.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! I might have guessed. It is by poison.\"\r\n\r\n\"It will be taken by _nothing_, I tell you. Why do you not listen to me?\"\r\n\r\n\"You speak in riddles,\" said Gina, faintly. \"But I will bear my fate,\r\nwhatever it may be.\"\r\n\r\n\"And in silence? _He_ asks it by your mutual love.\"\r\n\r\n\"All, all, for his sake,\" she answered. \"Tell him, as I have loved, so\r\nwill I obey him to the last.\"\r\n\r\nLucrezia walked on, and Gina followed. She saw and understood the manner\r\nof her death, but, faithful to the imagined wish of her lover, she uttered\r\nneither remonstrance nor cry. The clock was upon the stroke of one, when\r\nsmothered groans of fear and anguish told that her punishment had begun;\r\nbut no louder sound broke the midnight silence, or carried the appalling\r\ndeed to the inhabitants of the castle. An hour passed before all was\r\ncompleted: they were long in doing their deed of vengeance; and, when it\r\nwas over, Gina Montani had been removed from the world forever.\r\n\r\n\"Madame, she is gone!\" was the salutation of Lucrezia, her teeth\r\nchattering, and her face the hue of a corpse, when she entered the chamber\r\nof her mistress.\r\n\r\nThe Lady Adelaide had not retired to rest. She was pacing her apartment in\r\nunutterable misery. The social conditions of life, its forms and objects,\r\nwere to her as nothing since her terrible awaking to reality.\r\n\r\nMorning had dawned before the return of the Lord of Visinara. He was\r\nfatigued both in body and mind, and, throwing himself upon a couch, slept\r\nfor some hours. And he probably would have rested longer, had not an\r\nunusual disturbance and commotion in his household aroused him. They were\r\ntelling a strange tale: one that, for the moment, drove the life-blood\r\naway from his heart. It was, that the wicked dealings of Gina Montani with\r\nSatan had been brought to light on the previous day. The holy Father\r\nAnselmo had taxed her with her guilt, and she had openly confessed all\r\nwithout reserve; and that the Evil One had appeared in the night, and had\r\nrun away with her—a just reward.\r\n\r\nIn those times, a reputed visit of the devil in _propria persona_ would\r\nhave been likely to obtain more credence than it could in these: but it\r\nwould probably be going too far to say that the Lord of Visinara\r\nparticipated in the belief of his horror-stricken household. Certain it\r\nis, he caused minute inquiries to be made, although at the express\r\ndisapprobation of the spiritual directors of the neighboring monastery,\r\nsome of whom were attached to the services of his chapel, and pointed out\r\nto him the grievous sin it was thus to be solicitous about the fate of an\r\navowed heretic. But he could learn nothing. The maid who waited on her\r\ntestified that she assisted Gina to undress on the previous night. In\r\nproof of which, the garments she had taken off were found in the chamber.\r\nThe remainder of her clothes were in their places undisturbed; the only\r\narticle missing being a nightdress, which the attendant in question said\r\nshe saw her put on; and her bed had not been slept in. Giovanni spoke to\r\nhis wife, but she observed a haughty silence, and it was useless to\r\nquestion her. He had the moat dragged, and the neighborhood for miles\r\nround scoured, but no tidings could be obtained. Yet, strange to say, in\r\npassing on that first morning through the remote corridors, he fancied he\r\nheard her voice pronounce his name in a tone of imploring agony. He\r\nsearched in every nook and corner, but found nothing, and soon thought no\r\nmore of it, except to marvel how his imagination could so have deceived\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nAfter a time, peace was restored between the count and the Lady Adelaide;\r\nbut all bliss for her, all mutual confidence, had ceased for ever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was midnight. In the nursery at the castle sat the head nurse, and on\r\nher lap was the dying heir of Visinara, now eight or ten months old. Until\r\nnine days previous, he had been a healthy child, but, from that time, a\r\nwasting fever had attacked him, and now he was ill unto death. The Lady\r\nAdelaide, her eyes blinded with tears, knelt beside him, gazing on his\r\ncolorless face. The count himself was gently rubbing his little hands to\r\ntry and excite some warmth in them.\r\n\r\n\"Do you not think he looks a little, a _very_ little better?\" demanded the\r\nlady, anxiously.\r\n\r\nThe nurse hesitated. She did not think so, but she was unwilling to say\r\nwhat she thought.\r\n\r\n\"His hands—are they any warmer, Giovanni?\"\r\n\r\nThe count shook his head, and the nurse spoke. \"There will be hope, madam,\r\nif this last medicine should take effect.\"\r\n\r\nThe Lady Adelaide pressed her lips upon the infant’s forehead, and burst\r\ninto tears.\r\n\r\n\"You will be ill, Adelaide,\" said her husband. \"This incessant watching is\r\nbad for you. Let me persuade you to take rest.\"\r\n\r\nShe motioned in the negative.\r\n\r\n\"Indeed, madam, but you ought to do so,\" interrupted Lucrezia, who was\r\npresent: \"these many nights you have passed without sleep; and your health\r\nso delicate!\"\r\n\r\n\"Lie down—lie down, my love,\" interposed her husband, \"if only for a short\r\ntime.\"\r\n\r\nAgain she refused; but at length they induced her to comply, her husband\r\npromising to watch over the child, and to let her know if there should be\r\nthe slightest change in him. He passed his arms round his wife to lead her\r\nfrom the chamber, for she was painfully weak; but they had scarcely gone\r\nten steps from the door, when a prolonged, shrill scream, as of one in\r\nunutterable terror, reached their ears. They rushed back again. The nurse\r\nsat, still supporting the child, but with her eyes dilating and fixed on\r\none corner of the room, and her face rigid with horror. It was she who had\r\nscreamed.\r\n\r\n\"My child! my child!\" groaned the Lady Adelaide.\r\n\r\n\"Nurse, what in the name of the Holy Virgin is the matter?\" exclaimed the\r\ncount, perceiving no alteration in the infant. \"You look as if you had\r\nseen a spectre!\"\r\n\r\n\"I have seen one,\" shuddered the nurse.\r\n\r\n\"What _have_ you been dreaming of?\" he returned, angrily.\r\n\r\n\"As true as that we are all assembled here, my lord,\" continued the nurse,\r\nsolemnly, \"I saw the spirit of Gina Montani!\"\r\n\r\nA change came over the Lord of Visinara’s countenance, but he spoke not;\r\nwhilst the Lady Adelaide clung to her husband in fear, and Lucrezia darted\r\ninto the midst of the group, and laid hold of the nurse’s chair.\r\n\r\n\"What absurdity!\" uttered the count, recovering himself. \"How could such\r\nan idea enter your head?\"\r\n\r\n\"Were it the last word I had to speak, my lord,\" continued the woman, \"and\r\nto my dying day, I will maintain what I assert. I saw but now the ghost of\r\nGina Montani. It was in a night-dress, and stood _there_, far away, where\r\nthe lamp casts its shade.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense!\" said the count abstractedly. \"Pray did you see anything?\" he\r\ncontinued, banteringly, to Lucrezia, and to another attendant who was in\r\nthe room. They answered that they had not: but Lucrezia was white, and\r\nshook convulsively. A wild, frantic sob, burst from the Lady Adelaide. The\r\nchild was dead!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\n\r\nMany months again slipped by, with little to distinguish them save the\r\ndecreasing strength of the Lady Adelaide. She had been wasting slowly\r\nsince the shock given her heart at discovering her husband’s love for Gina\r\nMontani. She loved him passionately, and she _knew_ her love was\r\nunrequited; for affections once bestowed, as his had been, can never be\r\nrecalled and given to another. The illness of the mind had its effect upon\r\nthe body; she became worse and worse, and, after the birth of a second\r\nchild, it was evident that she was sinking rapidly. She lay upon the\r\nstately bed in her magnificent chamber, about which were scattered many\r\narticles consecrated to her girlhood, or to her happy bridal, and, as\r\nsuch, precious. Seated by the bedside was her husband; one hand clasping\r\nhers, in the other he held a cambric handkerchief, with which he\r\noccasionally wiped her languid brow. \"Bear with me a little longer,\" my\r\nhusband—but a short time.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bear with you, Adelaide!\" he repeated; \"would to the Blessed Virgin you\r\nmight be spared to me!\"\r\n\r\n\"It is impossible,\" she sighed, pressing his hand upon her wasted bosom.\r\n\r\n\"Adelaide\"—he hesitated; after awhile—\"I would ask you a question—a\r\nquestion which, if you can, I entreat that you will answer.\"\r\n\r\nShe looked at him inquiringly, and he resumed, in a low voice: \"What\r\nbecame of Gina Montani?\"\r\n\r\nEven amidst the pallid hue of death, a flush appeared in her cheeks at the\r\nwords. She gasped once or twice with agitation before she could speak.\r\n\"Bring not up that subject now; the only one that came between us to\r\ndisturb our peace—the one to which I am indebted for my death. I am lying\r\ndying before you, Giovanni, and you can think but of her.\"\r\n\r\n\"My love, why will you so misunderstand me?\"\r\n\r\n\"These thoughts excite me dreadfully,\" she continued. \"Let us banish them,\r\nif you would have peace visit me in dying.\"\r\n\r\n\"May your death be far away yet,\" he sighed.\r\n\r\n\"Ah! I trust so—a little longer—a few days with you and my dear child!\"\r\nAnd the count clasped his hands together as he silently echoed her prayer.\r\n\r\n\"Will you reach me my small casket?\" she continued; \"I put a few trinkets\r\nin it, yesterday, to leave as tokens of remembrance. I must show you how I\r\nwish them bestowed.\"\r\n\r\nHe rose from his seat, and looked about the room; but he could not find\r\nthe jewelcase. \"The small one, Giovanni,\" she said; \"not my diamond\r\ncasket. I thought it was in the mosaic cabinet. Or, perhaps, they may have\r\ntaken it into my dressing-room.\"\r\n\r\nHe went into the adjoining apartment, and had found the missing casket,\r\nwhen a shriek of horror from the lips of the Lady Adelaide smote his ear.\r\nHe was in an instant at her bedside, supporting her in his arms; the\r\nattendants also came running in. \"My dearest Adelaide, what is it that\r\nexcites you thus?\" But his inquiries were in vain. She lay in his arms,\r\nsobbing convulsively, and clinging to him as if in terror. Broken words\r\ncame from her at length: \"I looked up—when you were away—and saw—there, in\r\nthat darkened recess—_her_. I did—I did, Giovanni!\"\r\n\r\n\"Whom?\" he said becoming very pale.\r\n\r\n\"Her—Gina Montani. She was in white—a long dress it seemed. Oh! Giovanni,\r\nleave me not again.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will never leave you, Adelaide. But this—it must have been a fancy—an\r\nillusion of the imagination. We had just been speaking of her.\"\r\n\r\n\"You remember,\" she sobbed, \"the night our child died—nurse saw the same\r\nspectre. It may—\"\r\n\r\nThe lady’s voice failed her, and her husband started, for a rapid change\r\nwas taking place in her countenance.\r\n\r\n\"I am dying, Giovanni,\" she said, clinging to him, and trembling with\r\nnervous terror. \"Oh, support me! A doctor—a priest—Father Anselmo—where\r\nare they? He gave me absolution, he said. Then why does the remembrance of\r\nthe deed come back again now? They would not have done it without my\r\nsanction. Giovanni, my husband—protect and love our child—desert him\r\nnever. Giovanni, I say, can they indeed forgive—or does it rest above? If\r\nso, oh! why did I have her killed? Giovanni, who is it—Father\r\nAnselmo?—God?—_who_ is to forgive me? It _was_ murder! Giovanni, where are\r\nyou? My sight is going—Giovanni—\" Her voice died away, and the count bowed\r\nhis head in his anguish, whilst the attendants pressed forwards to look at\r\nher countenance. The Lady Adelaide had passed to another world!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was years after the death of Lady Adelaide, that workmen were making\r\nsome alterations in the Castle of Visinara, preparatory to the second\r\nmarriage of its lord, who was about to espouse the lovely Elena di\r\nCapella. They were taking down the walls of a secret passage, or corridor,\r\nleading out of the chapel to the neighboring monastery. Standing, looking\r\non, was the count, still, to all appearance, youthful, though he was, in\r\nreality, some years past thirty, but his features were of a cast that do\r\nnot quickly take the signs of age. By his side stood a fair boy of seven\r\nyears old—his heir—open-hearted, engaging, with a smiling countenance, on\r\nwhich might be traced his father’s features, whilst he had inherited his\r\nmother’s soft blue eyes and her sunny hair.\r\n\r\n\"What a while you are!\" exclaimed the child, looking on, with impatience,\r\nto see the walls come down. \"You should hit harder.\"\r\n\r\n\"The walls are very thick, Alberto,\" observed his father. \"All these\r\nniches, which have been blocked up, and in the olden time contained\r\nstatues, have to come down also.\"\r\n\r\n\"They are taking down a niche now, are they not, papa?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not yet. They are removing the wall which has been built before it. It\r\nappears fresher, too, than the rest; of more recent date.\"\r\n\r\n\"It seems extraordinarily fresh, my lord,\" observed one of the workmen.\r\n\"The materials are old, but it has certainly been rebuilt within a few\r\nyears—within ten, I should say.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not it,\" laughed the count. \"These corridors have not been touched during\r\nmy lifetime.\"\r\n\r\n\"This portion of them has, my lord, you may rely upon it.\"\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, the remainder came down with a tremendous crash, leaving the\r\nniches exposed, There was no statue there—but the corpse of the\r\nunfortunate Gina Montani, standing upright in her night-dress, was\r\nrevealed to their sight—nearly as fresh as if she had died but yesterday,\r\nhaving been excluded from the air. The features, it is true, were scarcely\r\nto be recognized, but the hair—the long brown curls falling on her\r\nneck—was the same as ever. This was her horrible death then—to be walled\r\nup alive! The count grew sick and faint as he gazed. Before he had time to\r\ncollect his startled thoughts, the child pulled at and clung to his arm.\r\n\"Take me away. What is that dreadful thing? You look white and cold too,\r\nnot as you always do. Oh, what is it? Dear papa, take me from here!\"\r\n\r\nThe workmen were affrighted—perhaps more so, though less shocked, than the\r\ncount. But one of them, partially recovering himself, touched the corpse\r\nwith an implement he had been using, and it came down a heap of dust. The\r\nLord of Visinara turned, and with steps that tottered under him, bore his\r\nchild back to the castle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou may hear in Italy unto this day, various versions of this tradition.\r\nOne will tell you that the Lord of Visinara offered moneys and treasures,\r\nto the half of his possessions, to the monks, if they would lay the\r\ntroubled spirit of Gina Montani, but that, although they tried hard, they\r\ncould not do it. According to another version, the friars would not try,\r\nfor that no heretic’s soul may be prayed for in the Roman Church. But,\r\nhowever the monks may have settled it amongst themselves, all versions of\r\nthe history agree in one particular, that the ghost _was not_ laid; that\r\nit never would be, and never could be, but still wanders on the earth. And\r\nyou were wise to profess faith in it too, if you go amongst the Italians,\r\nunless you would be looked on as an unbeliever, not a degree better than\r\nthe poor Protestant maiden Montani.\r\n\r\nSeveral descendants of Giovanni and Adelaide of Visinara, are still\r\nscattered about Italy, though greatly reduced in station. And the\r\naccredited belief is, that whenever death is going to remove one of these,\r\nthe spirit of the ill-fated Gina appears and shows itself to them in the\r\nmoments of their last and most terrible agonies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVISION OF CHARLES XI.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          From Sharpe’s Magazine\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are in the habit of laughing incredulously at stories of visions and\r\nsupernatural apparitions, yet some are so well authenticated, that if we\r\nrefuse to believe them, we should, in consistency, reject all historical\r\nevidence. The fact I am about to relate is guaranteed by a declaration\r\nsigned by four credible witnesses; I will only add, that the prediction\r\ncontained in this declaration was well known, and generally spoken of,\r\nlong before the occurrence of the events which have apparently fulfilled\r\nit.\r\n\r\nCharles XI., father of the celebrated Charles XII., was one of the most\r\ndespotic, but, at the same time, wisest monarchs, who ever reigned in\r\nSweden. He curtailed the enormous privileges of the nobility, abolished\r\nthe power of the Senate, made laws on his own authority; in a word, he\r\nchanged the constitution of the country, hitherto an oligarchy, and forced\r\nthe States to invest him with absolute power. He was a man of enlightened\r\nand strong mind, firmly attached to the Lutheran religion; his disposition\r\nwas cold, unfeeling, and phlegmatic, utterly destitute of imagination. He\r\nhad just lost his queen, Ulrica Eleonora, and he appeared to feel her\r\ndeath more than could have been expected from a man of his character. He\r\nbecame even more gloomy and silent than before, and his incessant\r\napplication to business proved his anxiety to banish painful reflections.\r\n\r\nTowards the close of an autumn evening, he was sitting in his\r\ndressing-gown and slippers, before a large fire, in his private apartment.\r\nHis chamberlain, Count Brahe, and his physician, Baumgarten, were with\r\nhim. The evening wore away, and his majesty did not dismiss them as usual;\r\nwith his head down and his eyes fixed on the fire, he maintained a\r\nprofound silence, weary of his guests, and fearing, half unconsciously, to\r\nremain alone. The count and his companion tried various subjects of\r\nconversation, but could interest him in nothing. At length Brahe, who\r\nsupposed that sorrow for the queen was the cause of his depression, said\r\nwith a deep sigh, and pointing to her portrait, which hung in the room,\r\n\r\n\"What a likeness that is! How truly it gives the expression, at once so\r\ngentle and so dignified!\"\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense!\" said the king, angrily, \"the portrait is far too flattering;\r\nthe queen was decidedly plain.\"\r\n\r\nThen, vexed at his unkind words, he rose and walked up and down the room,\r\nto hide an emotion at which he blushed. After a few minutes he stopped\r\nbefore the window looking into the court; the night was black, and the\r\nmoon in her first quarter.\r\n\r\nThe palace where the kings of Sweden now reside was not completed, and\r\nCharles XI. who commenced it, inhabited the old palace, situated on the\r\nRitzholm, facing Lake Modu. It is a large building in the form of a\r\nhorseshoe: the king’s private apartments were in one of the extremities;\r\nopposite was the great hall where the States assembled to receive\r\ncommunications from the crown. The windows of that hall suddenly appeared\r\nilluminated. The king was startled, but at first supposed that a servant\r\nwith a light was passing through; but then, that hall was never opened\r\nexcept on state occasions, and the light was too brilliant to be caused by\r\na single lamp. It then occurred to him that it must be a conflagration;\r\nbut there was no smoke, and the glass was not broken; it had rather the\r\nappearance of an illumination. Brahe’s attention being called to it, he\r\nproposed sending one of the pages to ascertain the cause of the light, but\r\nthe king stopped him, saying, he would go himself to the hall. He left the\r\nroom, followed by the count and doctor, with lighted torches. Baumgarten\r\ncalled the man who had charge of the keys, and ordered him, in the king’s\r\nname, to open the doors of the great hall. Great was his surprise at this\r\nunexpected command. He dressed himself quickly, and came to the king with\r\nhis bunch of keys. He opened the first door of a gallery which served as\r\nan antechamber to the hall. The king entered, and what was his amazement\r\nat finding the walls hung with black.\r\n\r\n\"What is the meaning of this?\" asked he.\r\n\r\nThe man replied, that he did not know what to make of it, adding, \"When\r\nthe gallery was last opened, there was certainly no hanging over the oak\r\npanelling.\"\r\n\r\nThe king walked on to the door of the hall.\r\n\r\n\"Go no further, for heaven’s sake,\" exclaimed the man; \"surely there is\r\nsorcery going on inside. At this hour, since the queen’s death, they say\r\nshe walks up and down here. May God protect us!\"\r\n\r\n\"Stop, sire,\" cried the count and Baumgarten together, \"don’t you hear\r\nthat noise? Who knows to what dangers you are exposing yourself! At all\r\nevents, allow me to summon the guards.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will go in,\" said the king, firmly; \"open the door at once.\"\r\n\r\nThe man’s hand trembled so that he could not turn the key.\r\n\r\n\"A fine thing to see an old soldier frightened,\" said the king, shrugging\r\nhis shoulders; \"come, Count, will you open the door?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sire,\" replied Brahe, \"let your majesty command me to march to the mouth\r\nof a Danish or German cannon, and I will obey unhesitatingly, but I cannot\r\ndefy hell itself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said the king, in a tone of contempt, \"I can do it myself.\"\r\n\r\nHe took the key, opened the massive oak door, and entered the hall,\r\npronouncing the words, \"With the help of God.\" His three attendants, whose\r\ncuriosity overcame their fears, or who, perhaps, were ashamed to desert\r\ntheir sovereign, followed him. The hall was lighted by an innumerable\r\nnumber of torches. A black hanging had replaced the old tapestry. The\r\nbenches round the hall were occupied by a multitude, all dressed in black;\r\ntheir faces were so dazzlingly bright that the four spectators of this\r\nscene were unable to distinguish one amongst them. On an elevated throne,\r\nfrom which the king was accustomed to address the assembly, sat a bloody\r\ncorpse, as if wounded in several parts, and covered with the ensigns of\r\nroyalty; on his right stood a child, a crown on his head, and a sceptre in\r\nhis hand; at his left an old man leant on the throne; he was dressed in\r\nthe mantle formerly worn by the administrators of Sweden, before it became\r\na kingdom under Gustavus Vasa. Before the throne were seated several\r\ngrave, austere looking personages, in long black robes. Between the throne\r\nand the benches of the assembly was a block covered with black crape; an\r\naxe lay beside it. No one in the vast assembly appeared conscious of the\r\npresence of Charles and his companions. On their entrance they heard\r\nnothing but a confused murmur, in which they could distinguish no words.\r\nThen the most venerable of the judges in the black robes, he who seemed to\r\nbe their president, rose, and struck his hand five times on a folio volume\r\nwhich lay open before him. Immediately there was a profound silence, and\r\nsome young men, richly dressed, their hands tied behind their backs,\r\nentered the hall by a door opposite to that which Charles had opened. He\r\nwho walked first, and who appeared the most important of the prisoners,\r\nstopped in the middle of the hall, before the block, which he looked at\r\nwith supreme contempt. At the same time the corpse on the throne trembled\r\nconvulsively, and a crimson stream flowed from his wounds. The young man\r\nknelt down, laid his head on the block, the axe glittered in the air for a\r\nmoment, descended on the block, the head railed over the marble pavement,\r\nand reached the feet of the king, and stained his slipper with blood.\r\nUntil this moment surprise had kept Charles silent, but this horrible\r\nspectacle roused him, and advancing two or three steps towards the throne,\r\nhe boldly addressed the figure on its left in the well-known formulary,\r\n\"If thou art of God, speak; if of the other, leave us in peace.\"\r\n\r\nThe phantom answered slowly and solemnly, \"King Charles, this blood will\r\nnot flow in thy time, but five reigns after.\" Here the voice became less\r\ndistinct, \"Woe, woe, woe to the blood of Vasa!\" The forms of all the\r\nassembly now became less clear, and seemed but colored shades: soon they\r\nentirely disappeared; the lights were extinguished; still they heard a\r\nmelodious noise, which one of the witnesses compared to the murmuring of\r\nthe wind among the trees, another to the sound a harp string gives in\r\nbreaking. All agreed as to the duration of the apparition, which they said\r\nlasted ten minutes. The hangings, the head, the waves of blood, all had\r\ndisappeared with the phantoms, but Charles’s slipper still retained a\r\ncrimson stain, which alone would have served to remind him of the scenes\r\nof this night, if indeed they had not been too well engraven on his\r\nmemory.\r\n\r\nWhen the king returned to his apartment, he wrote an account of what he\r\nhad seen, and he and his companions signed it. In spite of all the\r\nprecautions taken to keep these circumstances private, they were well\r\nknown, even during the lifetime of Charles, and no one hitherto has\r\nthought fit to raise doubts as to their authenticity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDIVINATION, WITCHCRAFT, AND MESMERISM.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   From the Dublin University Magazine.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt seems strange that so obvious a case as that of Barlaam and the monks\r\nof Mount Athos has not been brought into the mesmerical collection of\r\n_pièces justificatives_. The first compiler of the authorities on which it\r\nrests is Ughelli. The story is told in modern language by Mosheim, by\r\nFleury, and by Gibbon at the years 1341-51. In taking the version of it by\r\nthe last (Decline and Fall, c. 63,) we shall run least risk of being\r\nimposed on by over-credulity.\r\n\r\n\"The Fakirs of India and the monks of the Oriental Church,\" says the\r\ncomplacent philosopher of Lausanne, \"were alike persuaded that in total\r\nabstraction of the mind and body, the purer spirit may ascend to the\r\nenjoyment and vision of the Deity. The opinions and practices of the\r\nmonasteries of Mount Athos will be best represented in the words of an\r\nabbot who flourished in the eleventh century. ’When thou art alone in thy\r\ncell,’ says the ascetic teacher, ’shut thy door and seat thyself in a\r\ncorner: raise thy mind above all things vain and transitory; recline thy\r\nbeard and chin on thy breast; turn thine eyes and thy thoughts towards the\r\nmiddle of thy belly, the region of the naval; and search the place of the\r\nheart, the seat of the soul. At first all will be dark and comfortless;\r\nbut if you persevere day and night you will feel an ineffable joy; and no\r\nsooner has the soul discovered the place of the heart, than it is involved\r\nin a mystic and etherial light.’ This light, the production of a\r\ndistempered fancy, the creature of an empty stomach and an empty brain,\r\nwas adored by the Quietists as the pure and perfect essence of God\r\nhimself; and as long as the folly was confined to Mount Athos, the simple\r\nsolitaries were not inquisitive how the divine essence could be a\r\n_material_ substance, or how an _immaterial_ substance could be perceived\r\nby the eyes of the body. But in the reign of the younger Andronicus these\r\nmonasteries were visited by Barlaam, a Calabrian monk, who was equally\r\nskilled in philosophy and theology. The indiscretion of an ascetic\r\nrevealed to the curious traveller the secrets of mental prayer, and\r\nBarlaam embraced the opportunity of ridiculing the Quietists who placed\r\nthe soul in the naval; of accusing the monks of Mount Athos of heresy and\r\nblasphemy. His attack compelled the more learned to renounce or dissemble\r\nthe simple devotion of their brethren; and Gregory Palamas introduced a\r\nscholastic distinction between the essence and operation of God.\"\r\n\r\nGregory illustrated his argument by a reference to the celestial light\r\nmanifested in the transfiguration of our Lord on Mount Thabor. On this\r\ndistinction issue was taken by the disputatious Calabrian, and the result\r\nwas the convocation of a synod at Constantinople, whose decree\r\n\"established as an article of faith the uncreated light of Mount Thabor;\r\nand, after so many insults, the reason of mankind was slightly wounded by\r\nthe addition of a single absurdity.\"\r\n\r\nOf the truth of facts so long and openly discussed, there can be no\r\nquestion. The monks of Mount Athos did indeed put themselves into a state\r\nwhich may with safety be called one of mental lucidity, by fixing their\r\neyes intently on a point. Mr. Robertson, who used to induce the mesmeric\r\nsleep by causing his votaries to fix their eyes on a wafer, had better\r\nprecedent than he supposed for his practice; and Miss Martineau, who, in\r\nher artificial trances, saw all objects illuminated has been unconsciously\r\nrepeating a monastic method of worship. The contemptuous indifference of\r\nGibbon for once arises from defect of information; and when in a note he\r\nobserves that Mosheim \"unfolds the causes with the judgment of a\r\nphilosopher,\" while Fleury \"transcribes and translates with the prejudices\r\nof a Catholic priest,\" himself gives a luculent example of the errors of\r\nphilosophy, and of the often unsuspected approach of prejudice to truth.\r\nMosheim’s observation, notwithstanding the damaging approval of Gibbon, is\r\nnot without its value. \"There is no reason,\" he says, \"for any to be\r\nsurprised at this account, or to question its correctness. For among the\r\nprecepts and rules of all those in the East who teach men how to withdraw\r\nthe mind from the body, and to unite it with God, or inculcate what the\r\nLatins call a contemplative and mystic life, whether they are Christians,\r\nor Mohammedans, or Pagans, there is this precept, viz., _that the eyes\r\nmust be fixed every day for some hours upon some particular object_, and\r\nthat whoever does this will be rapt into a kind of ecstasy. See what\r\nEngelbert Kempfer states concerning the monks and mystics of Japan; and\r\nthe account of those of India by Francis Bernier.\" Strange that Mosheim,\r\nobserving the uniformity both of the process and of its results in so many\r\ndifferent parts of the world, should not have suspected that there was\r\nsomething more in this species of lucidity than the merely casual effects\r\nof a distempered imagination. By fixing the gaze even of the lower animals\r\non an immovable point, they fall into a condition equally unnatural, and\r\nwhich, if they had language to express their visions, would probably be\r\nfound equally clairvoyant.\r\n\r\nA favorite subject of mediæval art is the life of the Christian ascetic in\r\nthe Desert. In these representations a human skull may generally be seen\r\nplaced before the eyes of the devotee. Such an object would fix the gaze\r\nand induce the ecstasy as well as any other. The charm of this species of\r\ncontemplation must have been intense, since in search of its exaltations\r\nand illuminations the very convents were deserted; and during the fourth\r\nand fifth centuries the deserts of Idumea, of Egypt, and of Pontus,\r\nswarmed with anchorites, who seemed to live only for the sake of escaping\r\nfrom life, and in their fasts and mortifications rivalled, if they did not\r\nfor a time even surpass, the Fakirs of the East. To such an extent was\r\nthis religious enthusiasm carried, that in Egypt the number of the monks\r\nwas thought to equal that of the rest of the male population. Strange\r\nconsideration, if it be the fact, that a few passes of a mesmeric operator\r\nshould produce the same effects which these multitudes procured through\r\ntoils so painful and sacrifices to themselves and to society so costly.\r\n\r\nThe Egyptian method of inducing clairvoyance in boys, by causing them to\r\ngaze on a pool of ink in the palm of the hand, has already been identified\r\nwith the practice of Dr. Dee, whose blank spherical mirror is now said to\r\nbe in the possession and use of a distinguished modern mesmeriser.\r\nDivination by the crystal is a well-known mediæval practice; and from the\r\naccounts of it which Delrio and others have handed down it appears to have\r\nresembled, in some remarkable particulars, the method now in use among the\r\nsoothsayers of Cairo. It does not appear to make any difference whether\r\nthe polished object be black or white, a mirror, a solid ball, or a\r\ntransparent globe containing water: the same extraordinary series of\r\nappearances is alleged to follow an earnest inspection of it. Before\r\nproceeding to Delrio’s singular corroboration of this use of the crystal,\r\nit will be well to state what is known of divination by the phial and by\r\nthe mirror. Divination by the phial is technically known as\r\n_gasteromancy_. \"In this kind of divination,\" says Peucer, \"the response\r\nis given by pictures, not by sounds. They procured glass vessels of a\r\nglobular shape, filled with fair water, and set round them lighted tapers;\r\nand after invoking the demon with a muttered incantation, and proposing\r\nthe question, they brought forward a pure boy-child, or a pregnant woman,\r\nwho, gazing intently on the glass, and searching it with their eyes,\r\ncalled for, and demanded, a solution of the question proposed. The devil\r\nthen answered these inquiries by certain images, which, by a kind of\r\nrefraction, shone from the water on the polished and mirror-like surface\r\nof the phial.\"\r\n\r\n_Catoptromancy_, or divination by the mirror, is as old as the time of the\r\nRoman Emperors. In one of the passages relating to this method of inducing\r\nwhat is called clairvoyance, we have an illustration of the early\r\nacquaintance of mankind with some of the forms of mesmerism. The passage\r\nis found in Spartian’s life of Ditius Julian, the rich Roman who purchased\r\nthe Empire when it was put up to auction by the Prætorian guards. \"Julian\r\nwas also addicted to the madness of consulting magicians, through whom he\r\nhoped either to appease the indignation of the people, or to control the\r\nviolence of the soldiery. For they immolated certain victims (human?) not\r\nagreeable to the course of Roman sacrifice; and they performed certain\r\nprofane incantations; and those things, too, which are done at the mirror,\r\nin which boys with their eyes blindfolded are said, by means of\r\nincantations, to see objects with the top of the head, Julian had recourse\r\nto. And the boy is said to have seen (in the mirror) both the approach of\r\nSeverus and the death of Julian.\"\r\n\r\nThe passage may be variously rendered, according to different readings and\r\npunctuations, either as \"boys, who can see with their eyes blindfolded, by\r\nreason of incantations made over the top of the head;\" or, \"boys, who,\r\nhaving their eyes blindfolded, can see with the top of the head, by reason\r\nof incantations;\" or, \"boys, who, having their eyes blindfolded, can see\r\nwith the top of the head, it being operated on by way of incantation.\"\r\nThis seeing, or seeming to see, with the top of the head, is one alleged\r\nvariety of the modes of modern clairvoyance. It seems difficult to imagine\r\nthat the boy Horner, whose case is related by Mr. Topham, in a letter to\r\nDr. Elliotson, dated May 31, 1847, could have heard any thing of these\r\npagan practices. Mr. Topham, a barrister and man of credit, states: \"After\r\nfive or six weeks’ mesmerism, he began spontaneously to exhibit instances\r\nof clairvoyance. The first occasion was on the 11th of September. It was\r\nin the dusk of the evening, so that the room where he was mesmerised was\r\nnearly dark. My previous mode of mesmerising him had been by pointing at\r\nhis eyes, but on this occasion I began by making passes over the top of\r\nhis head, and continued them after he was in the sleep. In the course of\r\nfive or six minutes after the sleep was induced, he suddenly exclaimed\r\nthat he could see into the room above us (the drawing-room). I said, ’Your\r\neyes are closed; how can you see?’ And he replied, ’I don’t see with my\r\neyes; I see from the top of my head. All the top of my head seems open.’\r\nHe then described, &c. I found every thing as he had described, &c.\" Mr.\r\nTopham, it need scarcely be added, does not appear to have been at all\r\naware of the passage in Spartian, which, indeed, has not been cited or\r\nreferred to in any published work for nearly two hundred years back.\r\n\r\nA like use of the suspended ring, indicating the early acquaintance of\r\npractitioners in these arts with one of the alleged evidences of the\r\nso-called _odylic_ force, is thus described by Peucer among various modes\r\nof hydromancy: \"A bowl was filled with water, and a ring suspended from\r\nthe finger was librated in the water; and so, according as the question\r\nwas propounded, a declaration or confirmation of its truth, or otherwise,\r\nwas obtained. If what was proposed was true, the ring, of its own accord,\r\nwithout any impulse, struck the sides of the goblet a certain number of\r\ntimes. They say that Numa Pompilius used to practise this method, and that\r\nhe evoked the gods, and consulted them in water, in this way.\"\r\n\r\n_Crystallomancy_ is the art of divining by figures, which appear on the\r\nsurface of a crystal ball, in like manner as on the phial filled with\r\nwater. Concerning this practice, Delrio has the following remarkable\r\npassage, citing his contemporary, Spengler: \"A man well versed in the\r\nGreek and Latin fathers, and happy, if he had not presumed, with unclean\r\nhands, to dabble in the mysteries of our faith (Spenger), has published in\r\nGermany a learned commentary on the nature of demons, which he has\r\nprefixed to Plutarch’s Essay, _De Defectu Oraculorum_. From this (says\r\nDelrio) I extract, in his own words, the following narrative. There are\r\nsome (he says) who, being consulted on matters unknown, distinctly see\r\nevery thing that is inquired after in _crystals_; and a little further on\r\nproceeds to state, that he once had an acquaintance, a man of one of the\r\nbest families of Nuremberg, and that this acquaintance of his came to him\r\non one occasion, bringing with him a crystal gem, of a round form, wrapped\r\nup in a piece of silk, which he told him he had received from a stranger,\r\nwho encountering him several years before in the market-place, had asked\r\nhis hospitality, and whom he had brought home with him and lodged for the\r\nspace of three days; and that when the stranger was departing, he had left\r\nhim the crystal as a present, in token of his obligation, and had taught\r\nhim the use of it; thus, that if there was any thing he particularly\r\nwished to be informed of, he should take out this crystal and desire a\r\npure male child to look into it and say what he should see there; and that\r\nit would come to pass that whatever he desired to be informed of, would be\r\nindicated by appearances seen by the boy. And he affirmed that he never\r\nwas deceived in any instance, and that he learned matters of a wonderful\r\nkind from the representations of those boys, although no one else, by the\r\nclosest inspection, could see any thing except the clear and shining gem.\r\nAt a certain time, however, when his wife was pregnant of a male child,\r\nappearances were visible to her also in the crystal. First of all, there\r\nused to appear the form of a man clad in the ordinary habit of the times,\r\nand then would open the representation of whatever was inquired after; and\r\nwhen all was explained, the same figure of the man would depart and\r\ndisappear; but in his departure would often appear to perambulate the town\r\nand enter the churches. But the report of these appearances having spread\r\nin all directions, they began to be threatened by the populace. It also\r\nappeared, that certain men of learning had read in the crystal some\r\nstatements respecting doubts entertained by them in their studies; and\r\nmoved by these and other reasons, Spengler stated that the owner of the\r\ncrystal came to him, representing that he thought the time was come when\r\nhe ought to cease making such a use of it; for that he was now persuaded\r\nhe had sinned in no light degree in doing so, and had for a long time\r\nsuffered grievous pangs of a disturbed conscience on that account, and had\r\ncome to the determination of having nothing further to do with experiments\r\nof that kind, and had accordingly brought the crystal to him to do with it\r\nwhatever he pleased. Then Spengler, highly approving his resolution,\r\nstates that he took the crystal, and having pounded it into minute\r\nfragments, threw them, together with the silk wrapper, into a draw-well.\"\r\nSo far Delrio.\r\n\r\nAnother variety of this process is found in the _Onuchomanteia_, or\r\nnail-divinition, also spoken of by Delrio. \"In this species,\" says he,\r\n\"male children, before they have lost their purity, smear their nails with\r\noil and lamp-black, and then, holding up the nail against the sun,\r\nrepeating some charm, see in it what they desire. This mischief,\" he goes\r\non to say, \"has gone even farther in our own time. I myself knew one\r\nQuevedo, a veteran Spanish soldier, but more distinguished in war and arms\r\nthan in piety, who, being in Brussels at the time when the Duke of Medina\r\nCæli set sail from Gallicia for Belgium, clearly showed in more than one\r\nof his nails the fleet leaving the port of Corunna, and soon after\r\ndreadfully tossed by a tempest. Thus this man, who could also cure the\r\nwounds of others by his words alone, rendered his own spiritual state\r\nincurable by any one.\"\r\n\r\nThe like use of the crystal ball and spherical phial, containing water,\r\nsuggests a version of the epigrams of Claudian—\"De crystallo in quo aqua\r\ninclusa\"—which has not been afforded by any of the commentators. Globules\r\nof water are sometimes found inclosed in crystals, as well as in amber. On\r\none of those singular gems Claudian has composed a series of epigrams,\r\nwhich ascribe properties to the stone, and make allusion to uses of it\r\nhardly reconcileable with the idea of its being a merely puerile\r\ncuriosity. The earlier epigrams of the series are neat and playful, but\r\ninsignificant:—\r\n\r\n  \"The icy gem its aqueous birth attests,\r\n  Part turned to stone, while part in fluid rests;\r\n  Winter’s numbed hand achieved the cunning feat,\r\n  The perfecter for being incomplete.\r\n\r\n  \"Nymphs who your sister nymphs in glassy thrall\r\n  Hold here imprisoned in the crystal ball;\r\n  Waters that were and are, declare the cause\r\n  That your bright forms at once congeals and thaws.\r\n\r\n  \"Scorn not the crystal ball, a worth it owns,\r\n  Greater than graven Erythrean stones;\r\n  Rude though it seems, a formless mass of ice,\r\n  ’Tis justly counted ’mongst our gems of price.\"\r\n\r\nAnd so on through several others, until he comes to that one which seems\r\nto indicate something beyond a merely figurative use of the word \"nymphs;\"\r\nthough, after all, it is possible that the word was originally written\r\nwith an _l_, instead of _n_, which would make all the difference between\r\n\"nymphs\" and \"waters\":—\r\n\r\n  \"While the soft boy the slippery crystal turns,\r\n  To touch the waters in their icy urns,\r\n  Safe in its depths translucent he beholds\r\n  The nymphs, unconscious of the winter colds:\r\n  And the dry ball exploring with his lip,\r\n  Seems, while he fails, the illusive lymph to sip.\"\r\n\r\nThe Latin is subjoined:—\r\n\r\n  \"Dum crystalla puer contingere lubrica gaudet\r\n    Et gelidum tenero pollice versat onus,\r\n  Videt perspicuo deprensas in marmore nymphas,\r\n    Dura quibus solis parcere novit hyems:\r\n  Et siccum religens labiis sitientibus orbem,\r\n    Irrita quæsitis oscula figit aquis.\"\r\n\r\nNot the least remarkable of the qualities here ascribed to the crystal\r\nball is its energy in imparting the sensation of cold. Dom Chifflet, who,\r\nin 1665, published his learned treatise at Antwerp on the objects then\r\nrecently discovered in the supposed tomb of King Childeric, at Tournay,\r\nsays of the crystal ball which was found amongst them, \"You would say it\r\nwas petrified ice; so cold it was, that my palm and fingers, after\r\nhandling it, were quite torpid.\" And cites Anslem Boetius, in his book on\r\nstones and gems, as saying, \"the crystal is of so cold and dry a nature,\r\nthat placed beneath the tongue of a feverish person, it allays the thirst;\r\nand held in the hands even of those violently fevered, it refreshes and\r\ncools them, especially if it be of considerable size, and of a spherical\r\nfigure;\" and another writer on the same subject, Andreas Cisalpinus, who\r\nstates of the marble called ophite, that \"they make of it little globes,\r\nfor the handling of such as are in burning fever, the coldness of the\r\nstone expelling the disease.\" So far Dom Chifflet. It seems almost as if\r\nwe were reading Reichenbach. \"He (Reichenbach) found that crystals are\r\ncapable of producing all the phenomena resulting from the action of a\r\nmagnet on cataleptic patients. Thus, for instance, a large piece of rock\r\ncrystal, placed in the hand of a nervous patient, affects the fingers so\r\nas to make them grasp the crystal involuntarily, and shut the fist.\r\nReichenbach found that more than half of all the persons he tried were\r\nsensible of its action.\" Chifflet probably was a man of a nervous\r\ntemperament. Those who desire to see the crystal ball in question, may\r\ninspect it, where it is still preserved, with other objects found in the\r\ntomb, at the Gallerie de Medailles, in Paris. Two similar balls may be\r\nseen here in the collection of the Royal Irish Academy.\r\n\r\nThe use of water in communicating an ecstacy similar to the mesmeric\r\nlucidity, is largely dwelt on by the mystical writers known as the\r\nNeo-Platonists. Psellus describes a mode of divinition among the Assyrians\r\nby a basin, which smacks strongly of the mesmeric practice. \"The water,\r\nwhich is poured into the basin, seems, as to its substance, to differ in\r\nnothing from other water; but it possesses a certain virtue, infused into\r\nit by incantations, whereby it is rendered more apt for the reception of\r\nthe demon.\" The effect of the waters of some sacred places on those\r\naccustomed to their influence, was also such as is claimed for the\r\nmesmerized waters of our present practitioners. Jamblichus gives this\r\naccount of the Colophonian oracle:—\"There was a subterranean place at\r\nColophon, near Ephesus, in which was a fountain. The priest on stated\r\nnights sacrificed, then drank the water, and afterwards prophesied, being\r\nrendered invisible to the spectators. It might seem,\" he says, \"to some\r\nthat the Divine Spirit passed into the priest through the water. But this\r\nis not so; for the divine influence is not transmitted thus according to\r\nthe laws of distance and division, through these things which participate\r\nin it, but comprehends them from without, and inwardly illuminates and\r\nfills them with lucidity, and fills the water also with a certain virtue\r\nconducive to the prophetic faculty, that is, a clarifying virtue; so that\r\nwhen the priest drinks, it purifies the luminous spirit which is implanted\r\nin him, and accommodates it to God, and by that purifying and\r\naccommodating process, enables him to apprehend the deity. But there is\r\nanother kind of presence of the god, besides the virtue infused into the\r\nwafer, which illumines all around, above, and within us, and which no man\r\nwants, if he can only attain to the necessary state of congruity. And so\r\nof a sudden it falls on the prophet, and makes use of him as an\r\ninstrument; and he in the meantime has no command of himself, and knows\r\nnot what he says, nor where he is, and with difficulty comes to himself\r\nagain, after the response given. Moreover, before drinking the water, he\r\nabstains for a day and night from food, and partakes of certain mysteries\r\ninaccessible to the vulgar; from which it is to be collected that there\r\nare two methods by which man may be prepared for the reception of the\r\ndivine influence: one by the drinking of purgatorial water, endowed by the\r\nDeity with a clarifying virtue; the other, by sobriety, solitude, the\r\nseparation of the mind from the body, and the intent contemplation of the\r\nDeity.\"\r\n\r\nOne might here suppose he read of the rites of St. Patrick’s Purgatory.\r\nThe water of the lake there is usually called wine, and it may be that on\r\nminds and bodies \"which have attained to the needful congruity,\" it has\r\noperated as wonderful effects as the Colophonian fount itself. The\r\nproceedings of the priestess at Brancidæ, who also, from amongst other\r\nsources, derived the afflatus, or _Waren_, from a fountain, are to the\r\nsame purpose. \"The prophetic priestess at Brancidæ either sits on an axis\r\n[exposing herself to the influence, as the Pythoness on her Tripod], or\r\nholds a wand in her hand, given by some god, or dips the hem of her\r\ngarment, in water, or inhales a certain vapor of water, and by these\r\nmethods is filled with the divine illumination, receives the god, and\r\nprophesies. But, that the prophetic faculty comes from no corporeal or\r\nanimal source, and from no local or material instrumentality, but solely\r\nand extrinsically from the presence of the incoming deity, appears from\r\nthis, that the priestess, before she gives her oracle, performs many\r\nceremonious rites, observes strict purity, bathes, abstains for three days\r\nfrom food, dwells apart, and so, by little and little, begins to be\r\nilluminated and enraptured.\" What the exact meaning of sitting on an axis\r\nmay be, it is difficult to divine; but those who allege that a patient may\r\nbe thrown into the mesmeric trance by holding a magnetized branch—and\r\nthose also who have read of all the phenomena of exorcism being as fully\r\nelicited by a satchel of feathers as by a bag of reliques—will readily\r\napply the wand \"presented by some deity,\" and placed in the hand of the\r\npriestess at the moment when she should receive the final cataleptic\r\nimpulse. If there be truth in the alleged modern cases of _clairvoyance_,\r\nwe need not be surprised at the singular coincidences which have sustained\r\nthe credit of Colophon and Delphi.\r\n\r\nNot to dwell on other methods of inducing the afflatus, such as by\r\ncharacters and amulets, by music, by dancing, and by movements of the\r\nbody, I shall now proceed with the effects alleged to have been produced\r\non the _afflati_. Jamlichus must still be our principal authority.\r\nLucidity and prevision have already been sufficiently indicated, and have\r\ndoubtless been readily recognized: the other symptoms will be found not\r\nless remarkable and equally familiar:—\"Man has a double life—one annexed\r\nto the body, the other separate from every thing bodily.... In sleep we\r\nhave the capacity of being wholly loosed from the chains that confine our\r\nspirit, and can make use of the life which is not dependent on generation.\r\nWhen the soul is thus separate from the body in sleep, then that (latter)\r\nkind of life which usually remains separable and separate by itself,\r\nimmediately awakes within us, and acts according to its proper nature,...\r\nand in that state has a presaging knowledge of the future.\" Then, omitting\r\na distinction between sleeping and waking inspiration, and coming to the\r\nlatter, in which, also, the _offlati_ have a presaging power, he\r\nproceeds:—\"Yet those (latter) are so far awake that they can use their\r\nsenses, yet are not capable of reasoning,... for they neither (properly\r\nspeaking) sleep when they seem to do so, nor awake when they seem awake;\r\nfor they do not of themselves foresee, nor are they moved by any human\r\ninstrumentality; neither know they their own condition; nor do they exert\r\nany prerogative or motion of their own; but all this is done under the\r\npower and by the energy of the deity. For that they who are so affected do\r\nnot live an ordinary animal life is plain, because many of them, on\r\ncontact with fire, are not burnt, the divine inward afflatus repelling the\r\nheat; or, if they be burnt, they do not feel it; neither do they feel\r\nprickings, or scratchings, or other tortures. Further, that their actions\r\nare not (merely) human, is apparent from this, that they make their way\r\nthrough pathless tracks, and pass harmless through the fire, and pass over\r\nrivers in a wonderful manner, which the priestess herself also does in the\r\nCataballa. By this it is plain that the life they live is not human, nor\r\nanimal, nor dependent on the use of senses, but divine, as if the soul\r\nwere taking its rest, and the deity were there instead of the soul.\r\nVarious sorts there are of those so divinely inspired, as well by reason\r\nof the varying divinity of the inspiring gods as of the modes of\r\ninspiration. These modes are of this sort—either the deity occupies us, or\r\nwe join ourselves to the deity, &c.... According to these diversities,\r\nthere are different signs, effects, and works of the inspired; thus, some\r\nwill be moved in their whole bodies, others in particular members; others,\r\nagain, will be motionless. Also they will perform dances and chants, some\r\nwell, some ill. The bodies, again, of some will seem to dilate in height,\r\nof others in compass; and others, again, will seem to walk in air.\"\r\n\r\nTaking these various manifestations in order, and beginning with the\r\nalleged power of resisting the action of fire, the reader will not need to\r\nbe reminded of many seemingly well-authenticated cases of escape from the\r\nfire-ordeal. It has been usual to ascribe the preservation of those who\r\nhave walked bare-footed over heated ploughshares to the use of astringent\r\nlotions: and where opportunity existed for preparation of that kind, their\r\nescape may perhaps be so explained. But in most instances the accused was\r\nin the custody of the accusers, and not likely to have access to such\r\nphylacteries. The exemption from the effects of fire was not confined to\r\nthose cases of exaltation attendant on the enthusiasm of conscious virtue.\r\nBosroger (La Piéte Affligée, Rouen, 1752) states of one of the possessed\r\nsisters of St. Elizabeth at Louviers, in 1642: \"One morning Sister\r\nSaint-Esprit was rapt as in an ecstasy. The bishop commanded the devil to\r\nleave her. Immediately she experienced dreadful contortions, and an access\r\nof rage, and, on a sudden, says the exorcist, her demon left her like a\r\nflash of lightning, and threw the young woman into the fire, which was a\r\nconsiderable one, casting her with her face and one hand direct between\r\nthe two andirons; and when they ran to drag her away, they found that\r\nneither her face nor her hand were in anywise burnt.\"\r\n\r\nIt would be idle to multiply instances of this sort from the monkish\r\nwriters. The preservation of the three youths in the Chaldæan furnace was\r\none of the miracles most adapted to the servile yet audacious imitations\r\nof the Thaumaturgists. It is only when their statements correspond in\r\nunsuspected particulars with the phenomena of experience—as, for example,\r\nin the case of Barlaam and the monks of Mount Athos—that they can be\r\nadduced without offending the judgment of rational inquirers. But the\r\naction of burning is an operation of mechanical and chemical forces; and\r\nhow any amount of spiritual or electrical effusion could prevent the\r\nexpansion of the fluids in the tissues and the disruption of the skin,\r\nseems hard to imagine. Something more must, one should think, have been\r\nneeded; and if the mesmeric and Pagan oracular ecstasies be identical,\r\nthis testimony of Jamblichus would lead us to suppose that that something\r\nwas supplied by the mind. However this may be, we shall be better able to\r\njudge after the investigation of some other of the alleged concomitants of\r\nPagan inspiration.\r\n\r\nThe insensibility to prickings and pinchings is perhaps the commonest test\r\nof the cataleptic condition; and, as will doubtless suggest itself to\r\nevery reader, was, until modern times, a popular test of witchcraft. That\r\nthe unhappy wretches who were put to death in such numbers during the\r\nmiddle ages for this offence were actually in an unnatural and detestable\r\nstate of mind and body, cannot be doubted. They really were insensible to\r\npunctures; for if they had winced when pricked with pins and needles by\r\ntheir triers, it would have been deemed a proof of their innocence. A\r\nperson feigning the mesmeric sleep, and whose interest it is to feign, may\r\nendure such prickings with seeming insensibility; but it was not the\r\ninterest of the ancient witch to affect an insensibility, which would be\r\ntaken as one of the surest proofs of guilt. A perverse desire to be\r\nbelieved guilty is the only motive that can be suggested as likely to lead\r\nto such conduct; and those who have studied human nature most profoundly\r\nwill be disposed to give great credit to that suggestion. The same nature\r\nwhich in the fourth century ran into the epidemic frenzy of anchoritism,\r\nand impelled the Circumcellionist multitudes to extort the boon of\r\nmartyrdom from reluctant tribunals, may be admitted capable even of the\r\nmadness of a voluntary aspiration to the stake and pyre of the witch.\r\nCertain it is that many of the convicts boasted of their interviews with\r\nthe Devil, and seemed to be, if they were not, possessed with the\r\nconviction of having actually partaken of the orgies imputed to them. Had\r\nthey really been there in imagination? Was it that the popular mind had\r\nrealized to itself an epidemic idea, and that the effect of the contagion\r\nwas to put its victims _en rapport_ with the distempered picture present\r\nto the minds of the multitude? In a moral epidemic the crowd, possessed\r\nwith one idea, are the operators: it is the _Panic_ possession of the\r\nancients, which was not confined to general terrors, but applied to\r\ngeneral delusions of every kind. The multitude itself radiates its own\r\nmadness; witness the Crusaders, the Flagellants, the Dancing Fanatics of\r\nthe fourteenth and fifteenth centuries; perhaps even we might add the\r\nMathewites of our own day.\r\n\r\nThe next symptom of possession was the power of passing through trackless\r\nplaces, the disposition to run to wilds and mountains, like that rage of\r\nthe votary of Bacchus:\r\n\r\n  \"Quo me Bacche, rapis tui\r\n  Plenum? Quæ in nemora aut quos agor in specus\r\n  Velox mente nova?\"\r\n\r\nThe Bacchic ecstasy was not merely drunkenness, but an epidemic madness\r\ninduced by long-continued dancing and gesticulating to the sound of\r\ncymbals and other noisy instruments, in all respects identical with the\r\nmethods of inducing the Hindoo _Waren_. The dancing mania also of the\r\nfifteenth century, described by Hecker in his _Epidemics of the Middle\r\nAges_, was induced in the same manner, and its effects were the\r\nsame,—possession, illumination, and insensibility to external influences.\r\nThat the Bacchic and Corybantic frenzies were, in all respects, identical\r\nwith the middle age dancing manias, and with the possession of those who\r\nstill exhibit the influences of _Waren_ in Hindoostan, can hardly be\r\ndoubted. \"As for the Bacchanalian motions and friskings of the\r\n_Corybantes_,\" says Plutarch in his Essay on Love, \"there is a way to\r\nallay these extravagant transports, by changing the measure from the\r\n_Trochaic_ to the _Spondaic_, and the tone from the _Phrygian_ to the\r\n_Doric_:\" just as with the dancers of St. Vitus, and those bit by the\r\nTarantula. Hecker states, \"The swarms of St. John’s dancers were\r\naccompanied by minstrels playing those noisy instruments which roused\r\ntheir morbid feelings; moreover, by means of intoxicating music, a kind of\r\ndemoniacal festival for the rude multitude was established, which had the\r\neffect of spreading this unhappy malady wider and wider. Soft harmony was,\r\nhowever, employed to calm the excitement of those affected, and it is\r\nmentioned as a character of the tunes played with this view to the St.\r\nVitus’s dancers, that they contained transitions from a quick to a slow\r\nmeasure, and passed gradually from a high to a low key.\" After the\r\ntermination of the frenzy the conduct of the dancers, as well indeed as of\r\nall the victims of this species of possession, whether _Taratati_,\r\nconvulsionnaires, or revivalists, tallied precisely with that of the\r\nBacchic women. Plutarch, in his thirteenth example of the Virtues of\r\nWoman, has this graphic picture of the condition of a band of Bacchante\r\nafter one of their orgies. \"When the tyrants of Phocea had taken Delphos,\r\nand the Thebans undertook that war against them which was called the Holy\r\nWar, certain women devoted to Bacchus (which they called _Thyades_) fell\r\nfrantic, and went a gadding by night, and, mistaking their way, came to\r\nAmphissa, and being very much tired, and not as yet in their right wits,\r\nthey flung themselves down in the market-place and fell asleep, as they\r\nlay scattered up and down here and there. But the wives of the\r\nAmphisseans, fearing because the city was engaged to aid in the Phocean\r\nwar, and abundance of the tyrants’ soldiers were present in the city, the\r\n_Thyades_ should have any indignity put upon them, ran forth all of them\r\ninto the market-place, and stood silently round about them; neither would\r\noffer them any disturbance while they slept, but when they were awake they\r\nattended their service particularly, and brought them refreshments; and,\r\nin fine, by persuasion, obtained leave of their husbands that they might\r\naccompany them in safety to their own borders.\"\r\n\r\nIn the same way, throughout the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, might\r\ngroups of both sexes be seen lying, exhausted from their agitations, in\r\nthe streets of Aix-la-chapelle, Cologne, Strasburg, Naples, and elsewhere;\r\nand even in our own century sights not dissimilar have been witnessed at\r\nrevival assemblages in Wales and Scotland, and at camp-meetings in North\r\nAmerica. The rending of Pentheus on Mount Citheron by his own mother and\r\nsisters, who, while under the influence of the Bacchic _afflatus_,\r\nimagined they saw in his form the appearance of a wild beast, might be\r\nadduced as an example at once of the furious character of the frenzy, and\r\nof the liability of the afflated to optical illusions. Has what we read of\r\nfairy-gifts and glamour any foundation in this alleged power of the\r\nbiologist to make his patient imagine different forms for the same object?\r\nBut we are still among the mountain tops, and must descend to the\r\nremaining symptoms enumerated by Jamblichus.\r\n\r\n\"They pass over rivers in a wonderful manner, which the priestess herself\r\nalso does in the Cataballa.\" We here again encounter the _indicia_, of\r\nthat possession which went by the name of witchcraft in the middle ages. A\r\nwitch, really possessed, could not sink in the water, any more than she\r\ncould feel the insertion of a needle. The vulgar belief is, that the\r\nsuspected witch was cast into a pond, where, if she floated, she was\r\nburned, and if she sank she was drowned. The latter alternative was not\r\nso; if she betrayed no preternatural buoyancy, the trial was so far in her\r\nfavor, and she was taken up.\r\n\r\nNor was water the only test, in some parts of Germany the triers, less\r\nphilosophically, employed scales; and had fixed weights (from 14 to 15\r\nlbs.), which, if the accused did not counterpoise, they concluded them to\r\nbe possessed. But it will be asked, how can there be degrees of philosophy\r\nin practices equally insane, and which have been condemned by the common\r\nconsent of enlightened nations for near three hundred years? Insanity\r\nthere certainly was, and on a prodigious scale, in these ages; but the\r\njudges and executioners were not so insane as the multitudes who either\r\nbelieved themselves possessed by others, or believed that they themselves\r\nexercised the power of possessing. To us, living in an age of comparative\r\nrest from spiritual excitement, it seems almost incredible that thousands\r\nof persons, in all ranks and conditions of life, should simultaneously\r\nbecome possessed with the belief that they were in direct communication\r\nwith the devil: should cease to attend to their duties and callings,\r\npassing their time in hysterical trances and cataleptic fits, during which\r\nthey seemed to themselves to be borne through the air to witch orgies and\r\nassemblies for devil-worship, in deserts and mountains; and that while one\r\nportion of society gave themselves up to these hallucinations, another\r\nclass should, with an equal abandonment of every duty of life, have\r\nbetaken themselves to mope and pine, going into convulsions, and wasting\r\nto skeletons, under the idea of having been bewitched; yet nothing is more\r\ncertain than that it was such a frenzy as this the heads of the Church and\r\nthe temporal Government had to contend against in the fifteenth and\r\nsixteenth centuries. There were no mad-houses; if there had been, even to\r\nthe extent we now possess them, they would not have sufficed to hold a\r\ntenth part of the numbers whose contact and example would have been fatal\r\nto the peace, perhaps even to the existence, of society. If such frenzies\r\nwere, unhappily, to burst out among mankind at present, civilized nations\r\nmight transport their _energumeni_ to distant possessions; but the\r\nmiddle-age magistrates had no facilities of that kind: they should deal\r\nwith the terrible plague by the only means at their disposal; and these\r\nwere, either to let the madness wear itself out, or to repress it by the\r\nrope and faggot. If they had adopted the former course, the epidemic would\r\nprobably have passed through the usual stages of popular distempers; would\r\nhave had its access, its crisis, and decline; and when the scourge had\r\npassed, the public would have awakened to a full sense of the madness of\r\nwhich they had been the victims; but in that process there was the danger\r\nof society going to pieces—of the visionary frenzy of the possessed being\r\ntaken up by fanatics as the foundation of a new and abominable religion,\r\nand of the hostility of the ignorant and uneducated class, among whom\r\nchiefly the possession prevailed, being directed against the restraints of\r\ngovernment and the principle of property. Having adopted the other course,\r\nthey pushed it to cruel and inexcusable lengths; punished many innocent\r\npersons, and suffered many of the really possessed to go free. For they\r\nwhose madness was most to be apprehended, as most contagious, were not the\r\nwretches who fancied they possessed the power of bewitching others; but\r\nthe _convulsionnaires_, who deemed themselves bewitched, and were their\r\naccusers. Certainly if the same epidemic should ever again break out among\r\na European population, or even among a British population, the arm of the\r\nmagistrate would be again required to suppress it, and we would be better\r\nable to judge of the conduct of those whom it has been the fashion of\r\nmodern historians to represent as altogether ignorant and brutal\r\nexecutioners. So long as possession is only the result of manual passes,\r\nor of fixing the gaze on indifferent objects; so long as the effects are\r\nregarded as physical or psychological phenomena, due to a physical cause,\r\nand the pretensions of the practitioner are not rested on any peculiar\r\nreligious sanction, there is no danger of mesmerism degenerating into a\r\ndangerous epidemic; but we might have seen a very different state of\r\naffairs if the magnetizers and biologists had referred their powers to any\r\nspecies of supernatural agency; and possibly would have found ourselves\r\nlong since under the necessity of reviving those penal proceedings which\r\nwe have so generally been taught to abhor, as among the most revolting\r\nremnants of mediæval superstition.(5) Even as it is, these powers of the\r\nbiologist, if in truth they exist, are capable of fearful abuse. Let us\r\ntake, for example, one of the oldest methods of exercising influence, for\r\ngood or evil, on an absent person:—\r\n\r\n  \"As fire this figure hardens, made of clay,\r\n  And this of wax with fire consumes away;\r\n  Such let the soul of cruel Daphnis be,\r\n  Hard to the rest of women, soft to me.\"\r\n\r\nIf the waxen or clay image be but a concentrator of the good or evil will\r\nof the operator towards the distant object, and the witchcraft of the\r\nlove-sick magician in Virgil, or of the evil-disposed wizard of the middle\r\nages, be in truth no more than an exertion of biological power, it behoves\r\nsociety to take care how individuals should be suffered to acquire\r\nmesmerical relations with others, over whom they may exercise malignant as\r\nwell as healing influences. If the pretensions of the biologists be\r\nestablished, biology must soon be put under medical supervision. But to\r\nreturn to the phenomena of possession.\r\n\r\nThe propriety of trying alleged witches by water, has been impugned and\r\ndefended with abundance of scholastic learning; and, singular to say, its\r\nopponents have been chiefly found among the Roman Catholic writers, and\r\nits advocates among the Reformers. Delrio, by far the most learned of all\r\nthe writers on demonology, vigorously assails Rickius, the only notable\r\nRoman Catholic advocate of the practice. The arguments on both sides being\r\nbased entirely on scholastic definitions and distinctions respecting the\r\nnature of demons, and the baptismal and other spiritual virtues of water,\r\nare of little relevance in the present method of discussing physical\r\nphenomena. Both parties assume that the persons of witches exhibit a\r\npreternatural levity—Delrio admitting that something less than fourteen or\r\nfifteen pounds was the actual weight which popular belief throughout\r\nGermany ascribed to persons in that possessed state, no matter how large\r\nor fat they might seem to the eye; and Rickius gives an example of a\r\nwoman, executed by drowning in 1594, whom the executioner could hardly\r\nkeep under with repeated thrusts of his pole, so high did she bound\r\nupwards from the surface, and \"so boil up,\" as it were, out of the depths\r\nof the water. The levity of possessed persons in water might be accounted\r\nfor by a phenomenon attendant on those preternatural conditions of the\r\nbody which follow excitements of an analogous kind. The victims of the\r\nflogging and dancing manias in the middle ages, and subjects of the\r\nfanatical fervors of camp-meetings and revivals, alike experienced a windy\r\nintestinal distension, consequent on the departure of their mental frenzy.\r\nTo control this disagreeable symptom, the candidates for both species of\r\nafflatus used to come to their meetings provided with napkins and rollers\r\nwith which to bind their middles, and prevent the supervening inflation.\r\nPersons so puffed up would certainly float with all the buoyancy ascribed\r\nto the German witches, if cast into water; but they would still preserve\r\ntheir proper corporeal gravity if placed in a scale. Unless, then, we\r\nsuppose Delrio to have been the dupe of some singular and unaccountable\r\ndelusion on this point, the typanitic affections of the _convulsionnaires_\r\nwill not account for the anti-gravitating phenomena ascribed to medieval\r\nwitchcraft. There are some reasons, however, for the belief that these\r\nappearances may not have been wholly imaginary; for if any reliance can be\r\nplaced on the concurrent traditions of all religions, Pagan as well as\r\nChristian, supported by wide-spread popular belief, the high mental\r\nexaltation induced by religious abstraction, and also by other vehement\r\naffections of the mind, is actually attended with a diminished specific\r\ngravity. Of alleged ecclesiastical miracles of this kind it is better to\r\nsay nothing. The Roman Catholic and the Hindoo devotees equally claim for\r\ntheir adepts in religious contemplation an exemption from (among other\r\nearthly liabilities) the hindrance of weight. In the rapture of prayer,\r\nthe ascetic and the saint alike rise in the air, and spurn the law of\r\ngravitation with the other incidents of matter. Suspected evidences of\r\nthis kind are, however, of no weight in philosophical inquiry. It will be\r\nsafer to leave the Etstaticas and the Fakirs to their respective\r\nbelievers, and to take a story of the people, into which religious\r\nconsiderations do not so directly enter. The native Irish, then, have a\r\nremarkable tradition, as old, at least, as the seventh or eighth century,\r\nthat phrenetic madmen lose the corporeal quality of weight. A picturesque\r\nand romantic example of this belief is found in the story of the fate of\r\nSuibhne, son of Colman, King of Dalnaraidhe, as related in the bardic\r\naccounts of the battle of Moyra. Suibhne, a valiant warrior, has offered\r\nan insult to Saint Ere, Bishop of Slane; the affront is avenged by a\r\ncurse, the usual retaliation of aggrieved ecclesiastics in those days. The\r\ncurse falls on Sweeny in the most grievous form of visitation that could\r\nafflict a warrior:—a fit of cowardice seizes him in the very onset of the\r\nbattle, and drives him frantic with terror. \"Giddiness came over him at\r\nthe sight of the horrors, grimness, and rapidity of the Gaels; at the\r\nfierce looks, brilliance, and ardor of the foreigners; at the rebounding\r\nfurious shouts of the embattled tribes on both sides, rushing against and\r\ncoming into collision with one another. Huge, flickering, horrible, aërial\r\nphantoms, rose up (around him), so that from the uproar of the battle, the\r\nfrantic pranks of the demons, the clashing of arms, and the sound of the\r\nheavy blows reverberating on the points of heroic spears, and keen edges\r\nof swords, and warlike borders of broad shields, the hero Suibhne was\r\nfilled and intoxicated with horror, panic, and imbecility; his feet\r\ntrembled as if incessantly shaken by the force of a stream; the inlets of\r\nhis hearing were expanded and quickened by the horrors of lunacy; his\r\nspeech became faltering from the giddiness of imbecility; his very soul\r\nfluttered with hallucinations, and with many and various phantasms. He\r\nmight be compared to a salmon in a weir, or to a bird after being caught\r\nin the strait prison of a crib,\" &c. \"When he was seized with this frantic\r\nfit, he made a supple, very light leap, and where he alighted he was on\r\nthe boss of the shield of the warrior next him; and he made a second leap,\r\nand perched on the crest of the helmet of the same hero, who,\r\nnevertheless, did not feel him. Then he made a third active, very light\r\nleap, and perched on the top of the sacred tree which grew on the smooth\r\nsurface of the plain in which the inferior people and the debilitated of\r\nthe men of Erin were seated, looking on at the battle. These shouted at\r\nhim when they saw him, to press him back into the battle again; and he in\r\nconsequence made three furious leaps to shun the battle, but through the\r\ngiddiness and imbecility of his hallucination, he went back into the same\r\nfield of conflict; but it was not on the earth he walked, but alighted on\r\nthe shoulders of men and the tops of their helmets,\" &c.\r\n\r\nIn this state, Suibhne flits off the field of battle like a bird, or a\r\nwaif of the forest, without weight, and betakes himself to the wilds,\r\nwhere he \"herds with the deer, runs races with the showers, and flees with\r\nthe birds,\" as a wild denizen of the wilderness; but with his ecstacy of\r\nterror, he receives the gift of prophecy. Dr. O’Donovan, in a note on this\r\ncurious passage, observes, \"it was the ancient belief in Ireland, and\r\nstill is in the wilder mountainous districts, that lunatics are as light\r\nas feathers, and can climb steeps and precipices like the\r\nsomnambulists.\"—See _Buile Suibhne_, a bardic romance on the madness of\r\nthis unfortunate warrior. This latter romance is occupied with Suibhne’s\r\nadventures as a mad prophet, _Omadh_, in Irish. Query did the Bacchus\r\n_Omadios_ of the Greeks derive his name from a similar source? It would be\r\na singular coincidence that would make a Greek god an _omadran_. Keats,\r\nwith a fine intuition, has depicted those _mores afflatorum_, in the\r\nsatyrs who do the benevolent biddings of Pan:\r\n\r\n  \"Thou, to whom every faun and satyr flies,\r\n  For willing service; whether, to surprise\r\n  The squatted hare, while, in half-sleeping fit,\r\n  Or upward ragged precipices flit\r\n  To save poor lambkins from the eagle’s maw;\r\n  Or by mysterious enticement draw\r\n  Bewildered shepherds to their paths again.\"\r\n\r\nCompare with this picture of the Irish lunatic among the boughs of the\r\ntree on the field of Moira, the following extracts from Bosroger’s account\r\nof the possession of the nuns of Louviers, in A.D. 1642. One of the\r\nsisters, surnamed De Jesus, conceived herself to be possessed by a demon\r\nwhom she called _Arracon_. \"On the occasion of a procession of the host by\r\nMonseigneur the Bishop of Evreux, _Arracon_ exhibited another example of\r\nhis quality, causing sister De Jesus to pour forth a torrent of\r\nblasphemies and furious expressions all the time of the procession. When\r\nshe was brought into the choir, and held fast by an exorcist, for fear of\r\nher offering some insult, the holy sacrament was borne past her. Arracon\r\nimmediately caused her to be shot forward through the air to a\r\nconsiderable distance, so as to strike the gilt sun in which the adorable\r\neucharist was placed, out of the hands of the lord bishop; and the\r\nexorcist making an effort to detain her, the demon lifted her up in the\r\nair over an accoudoir, or leaning place, of three feet in height,\r\nintending to lift her, as he declared, into the vault, but the exorcist\r\nholding fast, all he could do was to cast the nun and exorcist back to the\r\nfloor together,\" &c. _Putiphar_, the possessor of Sister Saint Sacrement,\r\n\"made her with wonderful impetuosity run up a mulberry tree, of which the\r\nstem was easy enough of ascent; but when she got up the stem, he forced\r\nher onward till she approached the extremities of the slenderest branches,\r\nand caused her to make almost the entire circuit of the mulberry tree, in\r\nsuch sort that a man who saw her from a distance cried out that she flew\r\nlike a bird. Then the demon permitted her to see her peril; she grew pale,\r\nand cried out with alarm. They ran in haste to bring a ladder, but\r\n_Putiphar_ mocked them, crying, ’As I made this _chienne_ get up without a\r\nladder, so she shall go down,’ and caused her descend the same slender\r\nbranches to the stem, and thence to the ground.\"\r\n\r\nPere de la Menarday, in his _Examen Critique de l’Histoire des Diables de\r\nLondon_, gives a letter from a missionary priest in Cochin China,\r\ndescribing a case of demonopathy, in the course of which, if we could\r\nbelieve the narrator, the patient seemed for a time to have conquered all\r\nthe ordinary tendencies of gravitation. The missionary, M. Delacourt,\r\nwriting from Paris, 25th November, 1738, begins by protesting his\r\nunwillingness to expose himself to the repulses of public incredulity; but\r\nfor his friends’ sake consents to give the particulars. \"Voici donc le\r\nfait dans ses principales circonstances _tel que je l’ai vu de mes propres\r\nyeux_.\" In the month of May, 1733, a young native communicant, named Dodo,\r\nresiding at the town of Cheta, in the province of Cham, and kingdom of\r\nCochin China, being reproached by his conscience for the suppression of\r\nsome facts in his confession, fell into violent convulsions on attempting\r\nto take the host in his mouth. He was brought to the missionary, foaming,\r\nleaping, and blaspheming in the manner usual among victims of his malady.\r\nAfter many exorcisms, both by the missionary and by two other\r\necclesiastics, which only increased his sufferings, he was at length, by\r\ngentler entreaties, brought to make a confession. The missionary then\r\nrenewed his exorcisms, which he continued for a month with little success.\r\n\"At last,\" says he, \"I determined to make a last effort, and to imitate\r\nthe example of Monseigneur the Bishop of Tilopolis on a like occasion,\r\nnamely, in my exorcism to command the demon in Latin to transport him to\r\nthe ceiling of the church, feet up and head down. On the instant his body\r\nbecame rigid, and as though he were impotent of all his members, he was\r\ndragged from the middle of the church to a column, and there, his feet\r\njoined fast together, his back closely applied to the pillar, without\r\naiding himself with his hands, he was transported in the twinkling of an\r\neye to the ceiling, just like a weight run up by a cord, without any\r\nvisible agency. While he hung there, with his feet glued to the ceiling,\r\nand his head down, I made the demon, for I had determined to confound and\r\nhumiliate him, confess the falsehood of the Pagan religion. I made him\r\nconfess that he was a deceiver, and at the same time admit the holiness of\r\nChristianity. I kept him for better than half an hour in the air, and not\r\npossessing enough of constancy to hold him there any longer, so frightened\r\nwas I myself at what I saw, I at length commanded him to lay the patient\r\nat my feet without harming him. Immediately he cast him down before me\r\nwith no more hurt to him than if he had been a bundle of foul linen.\" It\r\nis by no means improbable that Pere Delacourt himself had become infected\r\nwith the madness of the monomaniac whom he was engaged in exorcising,\r\nbefore his eyes conceived that extraordinary image of the patient\r\nascending by invisible agency to the ceiling of the church. But his letter\r\nbears evident marks of having been written under a sincere belief of the\r\nreality of all that he describes, and he refers to several living\r\nwitnesses of the scene.\r\n\r\nReverting to this subject of optical illusion, already glanced at, we find\r\nstill another resemblance between the mysticism of the ancients and\r\nmoderns. The priestess rendering herself invisible to the bystanders,\r\nappears to transcend all the rest of Jamblichus’s wonders. Strange to say,\r\neven this pretension of the Colophonian prophetess is not without\r\nsomething analogous among the alleged phenomena of mesmerism. \"I requested\r\na young lady,\" says Dr. Elliotson, \"whom I had long mesmerised, with the\r\nnever-tiring devotion of a parent, and in whom I produced a variety of\r\nphenomena, to promise to be unable on waking to see her maid, who always\r\nsat in the room at work during my visit, till I left the room, and then at\r\nonce to discern her. On waking, she said she did not see the maid, but\r\nsaid she saw the chair on which the maid sat. Presently, however, she saw\r\nthe maid, was agitated, had an hysteric fit, and passed into the\r\nsleep-waking state. I now inquired how she came to see her maid, as I had\r\nnot left the room, and told her she must not (see the maid), when I awoke\r\nher again. I then awoke her again; she could not see the maid, was\r\nastonished at the maid’s absence, and at first supposed she was in an\r\nadjoining room; but presently rang the bell twice, though the woman was\r\nstanding before her, I moved just out of the room, leaving the door open,\r\nand she saw the maid instantly, and was astonished, and laughed.\" In the\r\nColophonian oracle, they were the spectators, not the prophetess, who had\r\nneed thus to be put under the influence of the mesmeric _glamour_. Can it\r\nbe that, in certain diseased states of the optic nerve, it really is\r\nsubject to the illusion of seeing objects rise in air, as well as go round\r\nin horizontal motion? They who saw these sights in the _adyta_ of temples,\r\nin caves and sacred groves, in initiations and oracular consultations,\r\nwere all prepared by fasting, watching, and prayer, for the reception of\r\nbiological influence, and possibly may have seemed to themselves to see\r\nwhat others desired they should believe themselves to have actually seen.\r\nWas Lord Shrewsbury under this influence at Caldaro?\r\n\r\nBut the reader will begin to suspect that his credulity is about to be\r\nsolicited for the aërial flights of witches on their sweeping brooms. This\r\napprehension may be dismissed. Witchcraft, or, to call it by its proper\r\npathological name, demonopathy, was a true delusion, true so far as the\r\nbelief of the monomaniacs themselves was concerned, but resting wholly in\r\ntheir own distempered imagination.\r\n\r\nFrom a learned and philosophic review of the great work of Calmeil, _De la\r\nFolie_, in the _Dublin Quarterly Journal of Medicine_, we extract the\r\nfollowing _resumé_ of the symptoms of this dreadful epidemic malady: \"The\r\nleading phenomenon was the belief of the sufferers that Satan had obtained\r\nfull mastery over them; that he was the object of their most fervent\r\nworship, a certain portion of their life being spent in the actual company\r\nof himself and his legion of darkness, when every crime that a diseased\r\nimagination could suggest was committed by them. Both sexes attended at\r\nthe Devil’s Sabbaths, as they were termed, where the sorcerers met,\r\ndanced, and enjoyed every wild pleasure. To these meetings they travelled\r\nthrough the air, though, by the power of Satan, their bodies seemed to\r\nremain at home. They killed children, poisoned cattle, produced storms and\r\nplagues, and held converse with Succubi and Incubi, and other fallen\r\nspirits. At the Sabbath all agreed, that from every country the sorcerers\r\narrived transported by demons. Women perched on sticks, or riding on\r\ngoats, naked, with dishevelled hair, arrived in thousands; they passed\r\nlike meteors, and their descent was more rapid than that of the eagle or\r\nhawk, when striking his prey. Over this meeting Satan presided; indecent\r\ndances and licentious songs went on, and an altar was raised, where Satan,\r\nwith his head downward, his feet turned up, and his back to the altar,\r\ncelebrated his blasphemous mass.\"\r\n\r\nEach individual sufferer believed herself or himself to have seen these\r\nsights, to have gone through these origies, and to have been transported\r\nto them through the air. If there had been but a few confessions, and\r\nthese exacted by torture, it might be thought that the fancies of the\r\nexaminers supplied the phenomena, to which the sufferers merely gave an\r\nenforced and worthless assent. But the confessions were as often voluntary\r\nas forced, and were indeed rather triumphant bravadoes than confessions of\r\nanything that the sufferers themselves deemed shameful. It was a true\r\nbelief in the minds of the parties affected. The question has already been\r\nasked, were they _en rapport_ with the rest of the diseased multitude, in\r\nwhose minds the common delusion existed? The question presupposes a mental\r\nsympathy and participation, by one mind, of images existing in another,\r\nwhich is one of the alleged manifestations of clairvoyance. But there is\r\nanother mode of accounting for these and similar phenomena, which as yet\r\nobtains the approval of physicians, more than any suggestions of\r\nclairvoyant communications. It is, that there are certain states of the\r\nbody in which the patient truly believes himself to see particular\r\nobjects, to do particular acts, and to possess special powers, which to\r\nthe rest of the world have no existence, but in respect of the patient\r\nhimself are realities as visible, tangible, and perceptible, as the actual\r\nexistences which surround him. For example, it is a fact which admits of\r\nno dispute, that a certain quantity of alcohol taken into the human\r\nstomach will cause the drinker to fall into _delirium tremens_; and that\r\nin that state the patient will, with his waking eyes, see objects of a\r\nparticular kind; in nine cases out of ten, the forms of rats and mice\r\nrunning over his bed, and about his person. There is no public delusion\r\nhere, no popular mind possessed with a fixed idea of these appearances, to\r\nwhich the individual delusions might be referred; yet the swallower of the\r\nalcohol in Dublin, and the swallower of the alcohol in Calcutta, will both\r\nsee exactly the same sorts of appearances, and will both express precisely\r\nthe same horror and disgust at their supposed tormentors. Is it the case,\r\nthen, that, as the forms of rats and mice come into the minds of men in\r\none kind of mental sickness, the forms of men and women riding on goats\r\nand broomsticks through the air, and the other apparatus of the\r\nwitch-sabbaths, may have been but the manifestations of another disordered\r\nstate of the mental organism, a symptom merely and concomitant of an\r\nepidemical disease? It is easy enough to understand how symptoms so simple\r\nas the appearance of what are usually called \"blue devils\" should be\r\nconstant in their attendance on a particular state of cerebral disorder;\r\nbut when the hallucination becomes so complex as in the fantasies of\r\nwitchcraft, it is difficult to suppose that that long train of appearances\r\nand imaginary transactions should follow on a merely pathological\r\nderangement of the brain. Between the two alternatives of referring these\r\nhallucinations to such a cause, on the one hand, or to a mesmeric\r\nsympathy, as above suggested, between the individual and the crowd of the\r\npossessed, on the other, it is hard to choose; but, perhaps, the latter\r\nwill appear to offer the less amount of difficulty. In the present state\r\nof knowledge, however, it would be rash to say that a particular state of\r\ndiseased cerebral action might not be attended with a perfect set of\r\nsupposed phenomena as complex and constant in the minds of the sufferers,\r\nas those which existed among the victims of demonomania.\r\n\r\nAn example less difficult of reconcilement with the theory of cerebral\r\ndisorder than that of the witchcraft of the fifteenth and sixteenth\r\ncenturies, and yet more complex than that of the fantasies of _delirium\r\ntremens_, may be found in the case of _lycanthropism_, or that form of\r\nmania in which men have fancied themselves transformed into wolves. This\r\ndisease also is contagious; and on many occasions has exhibited itself in\r\nall the terrors of a maniacal epidemic. As early as the time of Herodotus\r\nthe belief was rife among the Græco-Scythian colonies that a people called\r\nthe Neuri were subject to this species of metamorphosis; and Giraldus\r\nCambrensis, in the twelfth century, found the same superstition in full\r\nforce in Ireland. It again broke forth in Livonia, its ancient seat, with\r\nall the symptoms of a periodical annual epidemic, in the sixteenth\r\ncentury. Peucer gives the following account of what these maniacs\r\nthemselves believed to happen to them. \"Immediately after Christmas day,\r\nin each year, a club-footed boy appears, who goes round the country, and\r\nsummons all those slaves of Satan, of whom there are great numbers, to\r\nassemble and follow him. If they hesitate or refuse, a tall man appears,\r\narmed with a whip of flexible iron wires, and compels them with blows of\r\nhis scourge to come forth and proceed. He whips them so severely, that\r\noft-times the stripes left by the iron thongs remain impressed on their\r\nbodies and torment them cruelly. As soon as they go out and follow in the\r\ntrain, they seem to lose their human form, and to put on the appearance of\r\nwolves. Several thousands thus assemble. The leader walks before with his\r\niron scourge; the crowd of those who, in their delusion, imagine that they\r\nhave become wolves, follow after. Wherever they meet with cattle they rush\r\nupon them and rend them; they carry off such portions as they can, and do\r\nmuch destruction; but to touch or injure mankind is not permitted to them.\r\nWhen they come to rivers, the leader with a stroke of his whip divides the\r\nwaters, which stand apart, leaving a dry channel by which they cross.\r\nAfter twelve days the band disperses, and every man resumes his own form,\r\nthe vulpine mask dropping off him. The way in which the change takes place\r\nis this, as they allege: those who undergo the change, which occupies but\r\na moment, drop suddenly down as if struck with a fit, and so lie senseless\r\nand like dead persons; but they do not in fact go away or change their\r\nplaces at all; nor while lying in that seemingly lifeless state do they\r\nexhibit any vulpine appearance whatever, but they go out of themselves\r\n(and leave themselves) like dead bodies; and save that they are convulsed,\r\nand roll about somewhat, they exhibit no sign or evidence of life. Hence\r\nthe opinion has arisen that their spirits only are taken forth of their\r\nbodies, and put for a time into the phantasms of vulpine forms; and then,\r\nafter doing the bidding of the devil in that way, are remitted back to\r\ntheir proper bodies, which thereupon are restored to animation; and the\r\nwere-wolves themselves confirm this belief by acknowledging that in truth\r\nthe human form is not withdrawn from their bodies, nor the vulpine\r\nappearance substituted for it; but that it is their spirits only which are\r\nimpelled to leave their human bodily prisons, and enter into the bodies of\r\nwolves, in which they dwell and are carried about for the prescribed space\r\nof time. Some of those who have stated that they came long distances after\r\nescaping from the chains of their wolfish imprisonment, being questioned\r\nhow they got out of that confinement, and why they returned, and how they\r\ncould cross such wide and deep rivers, gave answer that the imprisoning\r\nforms no longer confined them, that they felt coerced to come out of them,\r\nand passed over the rivers by aërial flight.\"\r\n\r\nThe same features marked the outbreak of lycanthropy in the years\r\n1598-1600, among the Vaudois. The possessed fell into catalepsy, and lay\r\nsenseless during the time they imagined themselves in their bestial\r\ntransformation. The disease was almost uniformly complicated with\r\ndemonopathy, or the possession of witchcraft.\r\n\r\nThere seems no reason to doubt that lycanthropism was a disease as\r\nconstant in its character and as well defined in its symptoms as _delirium\r\ntremens_, or any of the ordinary forms of mania. The evidences of its\r\nexistence are, however, considerably stronger than those of witchcraft;\r\nfor where on the one hand no credible witness ever saw a witch either at\r\nthe sabbath, or on her way to it, or on her return from it, there are not\r\nwanting distinct proofs on oath, corroborated by admitted facts in\r\njudicial proceedings, of persons afflicted with lycanthropy traversing the\r\nwoods on all-fours, and being found bloody from the recent slaughter both\r\nof beasts and human victims; and in one of these cases, that of Jacques\r\nRoulet, tried before the Parliament of Paris in 1598, the body of a newly\r\nslain child, half mangled, and with all the marks of having been gnawed by\r\ncanine teeth, was found close to the place where the maniac was arrested.\r\nIt is worthy of remark that both lycanthropists and witches ascribed the\r\npower of disembodying themselves to the use of ointments. Antiquity\r\nfurnishes no parallel to the horrors of these malignant and homicidal\r\nmanias. Their analogues may be found in the fabled styes of Circe, or in\r\nthe frenzied raptures of the Sybilline and Delphic priestesses; but the\r\nextent, the variety, and the hideousness of the disease in modern times,\r\ninfinitely surpass all that was ever dreamt of in Pagan credulity. The\r\npoints of resemblance, however, are not yet exhausted.\r\n\r\n\"A chief sign of the divine afflatus,\" says Jamblichus, citing Porphyry,\r\n\"is, that he who induces the _numen_ into himself, sees the spirit\r\ndescending, and its quantity and quality. Also, he who receives the\r\n_numen_ sees before the reception a certain likeness of a fire; sometimes,\r\nalso, this is beheld by the bystanders, both at the advent and the\r\ndeparture of the god. By which sign, they who are skilful in these matters\r\ndiscern, with perfect accuracy, what is the power of the numen, and what\r\nits order, and what are the things concerning which it can give true\r\nresponses, and what it is competent to do.... Thus it is that the\r\nexcellence of this divine fire, and appearance, as it were, of ineffable\r\nlight, comes down upon, and fills, and dominates over the possessed\r\nperson, and he is wholly involved in it, so that he cannot do any act of\r\nhimself.... But after this comes ecstacy, or disembodiment.\"\r\n\r\nThomas Bartholin (brother of Gaspar) has anticipated the inquiries of Sir\r\nHenry Marsh, and of Reichenbach himself, on the subject of light from the\r\nhuman body. In a treatise, full of singular learning, \"De luce Animalium,\"\r\nhe has adduced a multitude of examples of the evolution of light from the\r\nliving as well as the dead body, and in the cases of secular and pagan, as\r\nwell as of ecclesiastical and Christian, persons; and this, without having\r\nrecourse to any testimony of the Hagiologists. The _Aureolæ_ of the\r\nChristian saints may not, after all, have been the merely fanciful\r\nadditions of superstitious artists.\r\n\r\nThe convulsive distortions of the Pythoness were but a feeble type of the\r\nphenomena of demonopathy, or the supposed possession of the middle ages.\r\nIt was chiefly in convents, among the crowd of young girls and women, that\r\nthese dreadful disorders were used to break out; but the visitation was\r\nnot confined to convents, nor to the profession of any particular creed.\r\nWherever religious excitation prevailed among the young and susceptible,\r\nespecially when they happened to be brought together in considerable\r\nnumbers, there the pest was attracted, as a fever or other malady would be\r\nattracted by a foul atmosphere. No patient in the magnetic coma ever\r\nexhibited such prodigies of endurance as thousands of the involuntary\r\nvictims of these contagious manias. Who in any modern _seance_ has beheld\r\na patient supported only on the protuberance of the stomach, with the head\r\nand limbs everted, and the arms raised in the air, and so remaining curved\r\ninto the appearance of a fish on a stall, tied by the tail and gills,\r\nmotionless for hours at a time? Or what rigidity of muscle in magnetic\r\ncatalepsy has ever equalled that of a convulsionnaire, who would weary the\r\nstrongest man, inflicting blows of a club, to the number of several\r\nthousands a day, on her stomach, while sustaining herself in an arc solely\r\nby the support of the head and the heels? Madame de Sazilli, who was\r\nexorcised in presence of the Duke of Orleans, at London, in 1631, \"became,\r\nat the command of Pere Elisce, supple as a plate of lead. The exorcist\r\nplaited her limbs in various ways, before and behind, to this side and to\r\nthat, in such sort that her head would sometimes almost touch the ground,\r\nher demon (say her malady) retaining her in each position immovably until\r\nshe was put into the next. Next came the demon Sabulon, who rolled her\r\nthrough the chapel with horrible convulsions. Five or six times he carried\r\nher left foot up higher than her shoulder; all the while her eyes were\r\nfixed, wide open, without winking; after that he threw out her limbs till\r\nshe touched the ground, with her legs extended straight on either side,\r\nand while in that posture, the exorcist compelled her to join her hands,\r\nand with the trunk of the body in an erect posture, to adore the holy\r\nsacrament.\" We seem to read the proceedings of an electro-biologist,\r\nrather than of a pastor of the church: but the parallel is not yet at an\r\nend. \"The same nun,\" says Calmeil, \"towards the close of her exorcism,\r\nexecuted a command which the Duke imparted secretly to her exorcist.\" Then\r\nfollows this remarkable admission of the learned and cautious\r\nphysiologist:—\"On hundreds of occasions one might believe, in effect, that\r\nthe Energumenes read the thoughts of the ecclesiastics who were charged\r\nwith the combating of their demons. It is certain that these young women\r\nwere endowed, during their excesses of hysteria or nervous exaltation,\r\nwith a penetration of mind altogether unique.\" The children of the\r\nfanatics of the Cevennes, while in their supposed prophetic ecstacies,\r\nspoke the purest dialect of French, and expressed themselves with singular\r\npropriety. The same facility of speaking in a fluent and exalted style\r\nwhile in the divinatory ecstacy, was remarked of old in the case of the\r\nPythian priestess. \"Though it cannot be divined,\" says Plutarch, in his\r\n\"Inquiry,\" \"why the Pythian priestess ceases to deliver her oracles in\r\nverse; but that her parentage was virtuous and honest, and that she always\r\nlived a sober and chaste life, yet her education was among poor, laboring\r\npeople, so that she was advanced to the oracular sect rude and unpolished,\r\nvoid of all the advantages of art or experience. For, as it is the opinion\r\nof Xenophon, that a virgin, ready to be espoused, ought to be carried to\r\nthe bridegroom’s house before she has either seen or heard the least\r\ncommunication, so the Pythian priestess ought to converse with Apollo\r\nilliterate and ignorant almost of every thing, still approaching his\r\npresence with a truly virgin soul.\"\r\n\r\nWe might here, without any stretch of imagination, suppose we are reading\r\na commentary on the birth and character of Joan of Arc, or of any of the\r\nprophetesses of the Swiss Anabaptists. But to return to the possessions\r\nrecorded by Calmeil.\r\n\r\nThe biological relations alleged by the mesmerists appear in still\r\nstronger development in the case of the nuns of Auxonne in 1662. The\r\nBishop of Chalons reports, speaking of the possessed, \"that all the\r\naforesaid young women, being in number eighteen, as well seculars as\r\nregulars, and without a single exception, appeared to him to have obtained\r\nthe gift of tongues, inasmuch as they accurately replied to the matters in\r\nLatin, which were addressed to them by their exorcists, and which were not\r\nborrowed from the ritual, still less arranged by any preconcert; they\r\nfrequently explained themselves in Latin—sometimes in entire periods,\r\nsometimes in broken sentences;\" \"that all or almost all of them were\r\nproved to have introvision (_cognizance de l’interieur_) and knowledge of\r\nwhatever thought might be secretly addressed to them, as appeared\r\nparticularly in the case of the internal commands which were often\r\naddressed to them by the exorcists, and which in general they obeyed\r\nimplicitly, although without any external signification of the command,\r\neither verbal or by way of sign; as the said Lord Bishop experienced in\r\nmany instances, among others, in that of Denise Parisot, whom the exorcist\r\nhaving commanded, in the depths of his own mind, to come to him for the\r\npurpose of being exorcised, she came incontinently, though dwelling in a\r\nremote part of the town; telling the Lord Bishop that she had received his\r\ncommands and was come accordingly; and this she did on several occasions;\r\nlikewise in the person of Sister Jamin, a novice, who, on recovering from\r\nher fit, told him the internal commandment which he had given to her demon\r\nduring the exorcism; also in the case of the Sister Borthon, to whom\r\nhaving issued a mental commandment in one of her paroxysms to come and\r\nprostrate herself before the Holy Sacrament, with her face to the ground\r\nand her arms stretched forward, she executed his command at the very\r\ninstant that he willed it, with a promptitude and precipitation altogether\r\nwonderful.\"\r\n\r\nSister Denise Parisot, one of those who exhibited these singularities,\r\nalso displayed a farther and very remarkable manifestation of what would\r\nnow be called biological influence. \"Being commanded by his Lordship to\r\nmake the pulse of her right arm entirely cease beating while that of the\r\nleft continued, and then to transfer the pulsation so as to beat in the\r\nright arm while it should stop in the left, she executed his orders with\r\nthe utmost precision in the presence of the physician (Morel), who\r\nadmitted and deposed to the fact, and of several ecclesiastics. Sister de\r\nla Purification did the same thing two or three times, causing her pulse\r\nto beat or to stop at the command of the exorcist.\"\r\n\r\nInstead of exorcist we may, without much apprehension of offending either\r\nthe reason or the belief of any candid person, read \"Mesmerist.\" The\r\npasses seem similar, the phenomena identical. Again, in the case of the\r\ngirls of the parish of Landes, near Bayeux, in 1732, the orders given by\r\nthe exorcists in Latin appeared to be well understood by the patients. \"In\r\ngeneral,\" says Calmeil, quoting the contemporaneous account of their\r\npossession, \"during the ecstatic access, the sense of touch was not\r\nexcited even by the application of fire; nevertheless the exorcists affirm\r\nthat their patients yielded immediate attention to the thoughts which they\r\n(the exorcists) refrained from expressing, and that they described with\r\nexactness the interior of distant houses which they had never before\r\nseen.\"\r\n\r\nThis long and varied survey of different forms of physical and mental\r\nmalady brings us to a point where we may, with some confidence, take our\r\nstand on inductive conclusions. It seems evident, then, that all the\r\nphenomena of animal magnetism have been from an early period known to\r\nmankind under the various forms of divinatory ecstasy, demonopathy or\r\nwitchmania, theomania, or fanatical religious excitation, spontaneous\r\ncatalepsy, and somnambulism. That, in addition to the ordinary\r\nmanifestations of insensibility to pain, rigidity, and what is called\r\nclairvoyance, the patients affected with the more intense conditions of\r\nthe malady have at all times exhibited a marvellous command of languages;\r\na seeming participation in the thoughts, sensations, and impulses of\r\nothers; a power of resisting, for some short time at least, the action of\r\nfire; and, perhaps, a capacity of evolving some hitherto unknown energy\r\ncounteractive of the force of gravitation. That the condition of mind and\r\nbody in question can be induced by means addressed to each and all of the\r\nsenses, as well as involuntarily by way of sympathy or contagion. That the\r\nfixing of the eyes on a particular point, as a wafer, or the umbilicus, or\r\non a polished ball or mirror, is one of the most general and efficacious\r\nmeans of artificially inducing the condition of clairvoyance. That it may\r\nalso, on those prepared for its reception by strong mental excitement, be\r\ninduced by tumultuous music, as by the sound of drums and cymbals, by\r\nodors, and, perhaps, by unguents; and that the same condition also\r\nfrequently supervenes on long-continued and intense emotion, as well as on\r\nthose hysterical and convulsive movements of the body which sometimes\r\nattend on excessive religious excitation. That, induced by the latter\r\nmeans, clairvoyance has a tendency to become contagious, and has often\r\nafflicted whole communities with the most dangerous and deplorable\r\nepidemic hallucinations, as in the fancied witch-sabbaths of the\r\ndomonomaniacs, and prowling excursions of lycanthropes and vampyres; but\r\nthat, although in these demotic frenzies, the prevailing ideas and images\r\npresented to the minds of the sufferers are merely illusory, they possess\r\nthe capacity of being put in such a relation with ideas and images derived\r\nfrom actual existence in the mind of others, as to perceive and\r\nappropriate them. Beyond this it would be difficult to advance our\r\nspeculation with any degree of certainty; but if speculation may be at all\r\nindulged in such a question, it might, perhaps, be allowed to a sanguine\r\nspeculator to surmise that, possibly, the mind in that state may be put\r\n_en rapport_ with not only the ideas and emotions of another particular\r\nmind, but with the whole of the external world, and with all its minds.\r\nAnother step would carry us to that participation in the whole scheme of\r\nnature, pretended to by divinators and seers; but it must be owned that,\r\nin the present state of the evidences, there is no solid ground on which\r\nto rest the foot of conjecture in taking either the one step or the other.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, many practitioners are playing with an agency, the\r\ndangerous character of which they little suspect. In ancient exorcisms, it\r\nsometimes happened that the exorcist himself became the involuntary\r\nrecipient of the contagious frenzy of the patient. If such an event\r\nhappened now, it would not be more wonderful than when it befel the Pere\r\nSurin, at Loudon, in 1635, as he has himself described his disaster in his\r\nletter to the Jesuit Attichi: \"For three months and a half I have never\r\nbeen without a devil in full exercise within me. While I was engaged in\r\nthe performance of my ministry, the devil passed out of the body of the\r\npossessed, and coming into mine, assaulted me and cast me down, shook me,\r\nand traversed me to and fro, for several hours. I cannot tell you what\r\npassed within me during that time, and how that spirit united itself with\r\nmine, leaving no liberty either of sensation or of thought, but acting in\r\nme like another self, or as if I possessed two souls; these two souls\r\nmaking, as it were, a battle ground of my body. When I sought, at the\r\ninstigation of the one, to make the sign of the cross on my mouth, the\r\nother suddenly would turn round my hand and seize the fingers with my\r\nteeth, making me bite myself with rage. When I sought to speak, the word\r\nwould be taken out of my mouth; at mass I would be stopped short; at table\r\nI could not carry the food to my mouth; at confession I forgot my sins; in\r\nfine, I felt the devil go and come within me as if he used me for his\r\ndaily dwelling-house.\"\r\n\r\nOr, if instead of passing into a single operator, as in the case of Surin,\r\nthe diseased contagion should suddenly expand itself among a crowd of\r\nbystanders, there would be nothing to wonder at, although enough to\r\ndeplore, in such a catastrophe. It would be no more than has already\r\nhappened in all the epidemics of lycanthropy and witchmania, of the\r\ndancers of St. Vitas, of the Jumpers, Quakers, and Revivalists, of the\r\nMewers, Barkers, and Convulsionnaires. The absence of religious\r\npretensions among the operators seems as yet to be the chief guarantee\r\nagainst such results. If instead of being made rigid and lucid by the\r\nmanipulations of a professor, the patients should find themselves cast\r\ninto that state by contact with the tomb of a preacher, or with the\r\nreliques of a saint, society would soon be revisited with all the evils of\r\n_pseudo_-miracles and supposed demoniacal possessions. The comparatively\r\ninnocent frenzy of the followers of Father Mathew, was the nearest\r\napproach to a social disturbance of that kind that our country has been\r\nvisited by since the barking epidemic of the fourteenth century. \"In the\r\ncounty of Leicester, a person travelling along the road,\" says Camden,\r\n\"found a pair of gloves, fit for his hands, as he thought; but when he put\r\nthem on, he lost his speech immediately, and could do nothing but bark\r\nlike a dog; nay, from that moment, the men and women, old and young,\r\nthroughout the whole country, barked like dogs, and the children like\r\nwhelps. This plague continued, with some eighteen days, with others a\r\nmonth, and with some for two years; and, like a contagious distemper, at\r\nlast infected the neighboring counties, and set them a barking too.\"\r\n\r\nIf mesmerism did no more than demonstrate, as it has done, that all the\r\nsupposed evidences of modern inspiration, as well as of modern demoniacal\r\npossession and ghost-craft, are but the manifestations of a physical\r\ndisorder, capable of being induced by ordinary agencies, it would have\r\ndone a great service to the cause of social and religious stability. In\r\naddition to this, it has furnished surgery with a new narcotic, perhaps\r\nwith a new anti-spasmodic. It is not impossible that here, at length, a\r\nmeans may have been found for combating the horrors of hydrophobia. Its\r\nhigher pretensions of clairvoyance and provision, if not proved, are at\r\nleast not yet satisfactorily disproved. Its admitted usefulness may,\r\nperhaps, counterbalance its perils; but in every exercise of it, whether\r\ncurative or speculative, it is never to be forgotten, that the phenomena\r\nare those of disease, and that the production of disease, save for the\r\ncounteraction of other maladies more hurtful, is in itself an evil.\r\n\r\n                                                                     S. F.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA CHAPTER OF EPITAPHS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          From Sharp’s Magazine.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy F. Lawrence.\r\n\r\nThe best epitaphs, according to our notion, are generally the shortest and\r\nthe plainest. In no description of composition is elaborate and ornate\r\nphraseology so much out of place.  Where a world-wide reputation has been\r\nachieved, the name alone, with the addition perhaps of a date, is often\r\ncalculated to produce a more impressive effect than an ostentatious\r\ninscription. It has been observed that the simple words—\r\n\r\n                 CATHERINE THE GREAT TO PETER THE FIRST,\r\n\r\ninscribed on the monument erected by the Empress Catherine to the memory\r\nof her husband, arrogant as they are, contain the essence of the sublime.\r\nAnd, in like manner, among the most impressive memorials in Westminster\r\nAbbey are the words, \"O rare Ben Jonson,\" chiselled beneath the great\r\nplay-wright’s bust, and the name of J. DRYDEN, with the date of his birth\r\nand death, and the simple statement, that the tomb was erected, in 1720,\r\nby John Sheffield, Duke of Buckingham. We doubt whether the effect of the\r\nlatter would have been improved by the addition of the couplet written for\r\nit by Pope, admirable as it is:\r\n\r\n  This Sheffield raised: the sacred dust below\r\n  Was Dryden once—the rest who does not know?\r\n\r\nAmong the best epitaphs in the Poet’s Corner, we are inclined to number\r\nthat on Spenser, which combines in an eminent degree dignity and\r\nsimplicity, and possesses a character which at once attracts attention.\r\nThe monument on which it appears had been originally erected by Anne,\r\nCountess of Dorset, and having fallen into decay, was restored, in 1768,\r\nprecisely in its old form:\r\n\r\n  Heare lyes (expecting the second\r\n  Comminge of our Savior CHRIST\r\n  JESUS) the body of Edmond Spencer,\r\n  The Prince of Poets in his tyme,\r\n  Other witnesse than the works\r\n  Which he left behinde him.\r\n  He was borne in London in the yeare 1553,\r\n    And died in the year 1598.\r\n\r\nThe epitaph of Michael Drayton, another of the Elizabethan poets, said by\r\nsome to be the composition of Ben Jonson, and by others to be by Quarles,\r\nhas also a species of quaint beauty and solemnity which raises it above\r\nthe ordinary level. It was originally in gilt letters:\r\n\r\n                          MICHAEL DRAITON, Esq.\r\n\r\n                      A memorable poet of this age,\r\n              Exchanged his laurell for a crowne of glorye,\r\n                                Ao. 1631.\r\n\r\n    Doe, pious Marble! let thy readers knowe\r\n    What they and what their children owe\r\n    To DRAITON’S name, whose sacred dust\r\n    We recommend unto thy TRUST:\r\n  Protect his memory, and preserve his storye,\r\n  Remaine a lastinge monument of his glorye;\r\n    And when thy ruines shall disclaime\r\n    To be the treas’rer of his name,\r\n    His name that cannot fade shall be\r\n    An everlasting monument to thee.\r\n\r\nWe cannot say that the Latin compositions of this sort in Westminster\r\nAbbey are much to our taste. One however, we cannot pass over—that to the\r\nmemory of Goldsmith, by Dr. Johnson—a scholar-like production, dictated by\r\naffection, and full of grace and tenderness. In the delineation of the\r\npersonal and literary character of his friend, we recognize all the\r\ngrander traits of the honest giant’s loving heart and powerful pen.\r\nNothing can be in better taste than his commendation of Goldsmith’s\r\ngenius:\r\n\r\n  Affectuum _potens et lenis Dominator_;\r\n  Ingenio sublimis—vividus, versatilis,\r\n  Oratione grandis, nitidus, venustus—\r\n\r\nOf the English epitaphs, one of the most remarkable for elegance and\r\nsimplicity is that on Purcell, the composer, reputed, on the authority of\r\nMalone, to be by Dryden, It certainly is not unworthy of his pen:\r\n\r\n  Here lyes\r\n  HENRY PURCELL, Esq.\r\n  Who left this life,\r\n  And is gone to that blessed place\r\n  Where only his Harmony\r\n  Can be exceeded.\r\n  Obiit 21 die Novembris\r\n  Anno Ætatis suæ 37\r\n  Annoque Domini 1695.\r\n\r\nAmong more modern inscriptions, those on the great engineers, Watt and\r\nTelford, are particularly worthy of notice. The former is from the pen of\r\nLord Brougham:\r\n\r\n  Not to perpetuate a name,\r\n  Which must endure while the peaceful arts flourish,\r\n  But to show\r\n  That mankind have learned to know those\r\n  Who best deserve their gratitude,\r\n  The King,\r\n  His ministers, and many of the nobles\r\n  And commoners of the realm\r\n  Raised this monument to\r\n  JAMES WATT,\r\n  Who, directing the force of an original genius,\r\n  Early exercised in philosophic research,\r\n  To the improvement of the Steam Engine,\r\n  Enlarged the resources of his country,\r\n  Increased the power of man,\r\n  And rose to eminent place\r\n  Among the most illustrious  followers of science,\r\n  And the real benefactors of the world.\r\n\r\nThe inscription on Telford’s monument is equally chaste and beautiful. It\r\npresents this noble summary of his life and character:\r\n\r\n  The orphan son of a shepherd, self-educated,\r\n  He raised himself,\r\n  By his extraordinary talents and integrity,\r\n  From the humble condition of an operative mason,\r\n  And became one of the\r\n  Most eminent Civil Engineers of the age.\r\n  This marble has been erected near the spot\r\n  Where his remains are deposited,\r\n  By the friends who revered his virtues,\r\n  But his noblest monuments are to be found amongst\r\n  The great public works of his country.\r\n\r\nEvery visitor will reverently pause before the magnificent cenotaph of the\r\ngreat Earl of Chatham, which, though somewhat too confused and elaborate\r\nin its decorations, is not unworthy of the greatest of English ministers.\r\nHaving achieved a higher reputation as a statesman and orator than any\r\nother public man which his country had produced, and having fallen, as it\r\nwere, in her service, the national gratitude was displayed in an\r\nunprecedented manner by honors paid his memory. His body lay in state\r\nthree days in the painted chamber in the House of Lords—his public funeral\r\nexceeded in splendor the obsequies of princes—his debts were paid by the\r\nnation—and finally, the stately tomb to which we have drawn attention, was\r\nplaced over his remains. The inscription whilst exceedingly plain and\r\nsimple, is impressive and appropriate:\r\n\r\n  Erected by the King and Parliament\r\n  As a testimonial to\r\n  The Virtues and Ability\r\n  of\r\n  WILLIAM PITT, EARL OF CHATHAM,\r\n  During whose administration, in the reigns of\r\n  George II. and George III.\r\n  Divine Providence\r\n  Exalted Great Britain\r\n  To a height of Prosperity and Glory\r\n  Unknown in any former age.\r\n\r\nOf poetical epitaphs in the Abbey some of the most important are by Pope.\r\nLike everything else from his pen, they are carefully written, but viewed\r\nas monumental inscriptions, not distinguished for any striking excellence.\r\nAmong the best of them is that on the Honourable James Craggs, a secretary\r\nof state, rather discreditably mixed up with the South Sea Bubble:—\r\n\r\n  Statesman, yet friend to truth! of soul sincere,\r\n  In action faithful, yet in honour clear!\r\n  Who broke no promise, served no private end,\r\n  Who gained no title, and who lost no friend;\r\n  Ennobled by Himself, by all approved,\r\n  Praised, wept, and honored by the Muse he loved.\r\n\r\nThe one on Gay is interesting as a tribute of friendship, and as a\r\nfaithful portrait of that pleasing and amiable poet, the simplicity of\r\nwhose character is admirably delineated in the first couplet:—\r\n\r\n  Of manners gentle, and affections mild,\r\n  _In wit a man, simplicity a child_.\r\n\r\nAltogether it is a beautiful and appropriate composition, and we cannot\r\nbut regret that the monument on which it appears should be disfigured by\r\nthe doggerel, said to have been written by Gay himself, and inscribed on\r\nthe ledge just above Pope’s epitaph;\r\n\r\n  Life is a jest, and all things show it;\r\n  I thought so once, but now I know it.\r\n\r\nThat of Nicholas Rowe, the dramatist (also by Pope), has been admired for\r\nthe pathos of the concluding lines, the beauty of which, however, it is a\r\nmatter of notoriety, was considerably marred by a prosaic circumstance,\r\nwhich proves the danger of assuming facts even in poetical compositions.\r\nThe monument is commemorative of the poet and of his only daughter, the\r\nwife of Henry Fane. His widow survived him, and her inconsolable\r\naffliction was beautifully depicted:-\r\n\r\n  To these so mourned in death, so loved in life,\r\n  The childless parent and the widowed wife,\r\n  With tears inscribes this monumental stone,\r\n  That holds their ashes, _and expects her own_.\r\n\r\nAlmost, however, before \"the monumental stone\" was finished, the\r\ndisconsolate widow dried her eyes, and married a gallant colonel of\r\ndragoons, without considering that she was spoiling the beauty of her\r\nhusband’s epitaph.\r\n\r\nAmong the most flagrant instances of false taste, we must specify that on\r\nthe tomb of David Garrick. The tomb itself has been described as \"a\r\ntheatrical conceit, of which the design exhibits neither taste nor\r\ninvention.\" The epitaph was the production of Pratt, author of Harvest\r\nHome and other lucubrations which have long since been consigned to the\r\ntomb of the Capulets; and both epitaph and monument are thus spoken of by\r\nCharles Lamb in the _Essays of Elia_. Alluding principally to the\r\neccentric attitude of the actor’s effigy, he observes, \"Though I would not\r\ngo so far, with some good Catholics abroad, as to shut players altogether\r\nout of consecrated ground, yet I own I was not a little scandalized at the\r\nintroduction of theatrical airs and gestures into a place set apart to\r\nremind us of the saddest realities. Going nearer, I found inscribed under\r\nthis burlesque figure a farrago of false thought and nonsense.\" The\r\nfarrago in question is in verse, and represents Shakspeare and Garrick as\r\n\"twin stars,\" who as long as time shall last are to \"irradiate earth with\r\na beam divine.\"\r\n\r\nThere are but few epitaphs in St. Paul’s Cathedral—the other great\r\nresting-place of illustrious dead—worthy of remark or reproduction. The\r\nbest in the whole edifice, and one of the most perfect compositions of its\r\nkind, is the well-known inscription commemorative of its renowned\r\narchitect, Sir Christopher Wren:\r\n\r\n  Subditus conditur hujus Ecelesiæ at Urbis\r\n  Conditor, CHRISTOPHERUS WREN, qui vixit\r\n  Annos ultra nonaginta, non sibi, sed\r\n  Bono publico. _Lector, si monumentum requiris,_\r\n  _Circumspice._\r\n\r\nWe need not point out the beauties of this celebrated epitaph:—its\r\nterseness of phraseology (to which no translation could do justice)—its\r\nsuggestiveness, grandeur and dignity. Another Latin inscription in St.\r\nPaul’s is also deserving notice, both on account of its merit, and the\r\nindividual it commemorates—that on Dr. Samuel Johnson, written by the\r\nfamous Dr. Parr. Of English inscriptions in this Cathedral, the most\r\nstriking is that on the monument of John Howard. It concludes with the\r\nwell-known sentence: \"He trod an open and unfrequented path,to\r\nimmortality, in the ardent and unremitting exercise of Christian charity.\r\nMay this tribute to his fame excite an emulation of his truly glorious\r\nachievements.\"\r\n\r\nIt is no very easy matter to produce a good epitaph. Great practice in\r\ncomposition is required—great power of condensation—and the exercise of\r\njudgment and discrimination. In efforts at epitaph-writing, few English\r\npoets have appeared to advantage. One or two perfect specimens, indeed, we\r\npossess, but the success of a single writer must be set against the\r\nfailure of a great many. Of our good epitaphs, the very best, in our\r\nopinion, is that on the Countess Dowager of Pembroke, the sister of Sir\r\nPhilip Sidney, by Ben Jonson. Although it has been often quoted, we cannot\r\nexclude it from this paper:\r\n\r\n  Underneath this sable hearse\r\n  Lies the subject of all verse,\r\n  Sidney’s sister, Pembroke’s mother:\r\n  Death, ere thou hast slain another,\r\n  Fair, and wise, and good as she,\r\n  Time shall throw his dart at thee.\r\n\r\nAnother of Jonson’s epitaphs, although more rugged in versification, is\r\nalso deserving of quotation;\r\n\r\n  Underneath this stone doth lie\r\n  As much virtue as could die;\r\n  Which, when alive, did vigor give\r\n  To as much beauty as could live.\r\n  If she had a single fault,\r\n  Leave it buried in this vault.\r\n\r\nNot a few of Pope’s epitaphs, as we have before hinted, appear tame,\r\ninsipid, and characterized by a false taste. We except the well-known\r\ncouplet for the monument of Sir Isaac Newton, in which there are dignity\r\nof language and boldness of conception:\r\n\r\n  Nature and nature’s laws lay hid in night;—\r\n  God said, \"Let Newton be!\" and all was light.\r\n\r\nDavid Garrick is the author of some very good and characteristic epitaphs.\r\nThe best, is that on Claudius Philips, the musician, who lived and died in\r\ngreat poverty. It was some time ascribed to Dr. Johnson, but is now known\r\nto be the production of Garrick:\r\n\r\n  Philips, whose touch harmonious could remove\r\n  The pangs of guilty power and hapless love,\r\n  Rest here, distress’d by poverty no more,\r\n  Here find that calm thou gav’st so oft before;\r\n  Sleep undisturbed within this peaceful shrine,\r\n  Till angels wake thee with a note like thine.\r\n\r\nAnother of Garnet’s epitaphs, is that on Mr. Havard, the comedian, who\r\ndied in 1778. It is described by the author as a tribute \"to the memory of\r\na character he long knew and respected.\" Whatever its merits as a\r\ncomposition, the professional metaphor introduced is sadly out of place:\r\n\r\n  \"An honest man’s the noblest work of God.\"\r\n  Havard, from sorrow rest beneath this stone;\r\n  An honest man—beloved as soon as known;\r\n  Howe’er defective in the mimic art,\r\n  In real life he justly played his part!\r\n  The noblest character he acted well,\r\n  And heaven applauded when the curtain fell.\r\n\r\nThe one on William Hogarth, in Chiswick Churchyard, by Garrick, is in\r\nbetter taste:\r\n\r\n  Farewell, great painter of mankind,\r\n    Who reach’d the noblest point of art;\r\n  Whose pictur’d morals charm the mind,\r\n    And through the eye correct the heart!\r\n  If genius fire thee, reader, stay;\r\n    If nature touch thee, drop a tear:-\r\n  If neither move thee, turn away,\r\n    For Hogarth’s honor’d dust lies here.\r\n\r\nSome distinguished men have amused themselves, while living, by inditing\r\nepitaphs for themselves. Franklin, and the great lawyer and orientalist,\r\nSir William Jones, have left characteristic performances of this kind in\r\nprose, and from Matthew Prior we have a mock-serious one in verse. The\r\nlatter has been often quoted, but it will bear repetition:\r\n\r\n  Nobles and heralds, by your leave,\r\n    Here lie the bones of Matthew Prior:\r\n  The son of Adam and of Eve,\r\n    Can Bourbon or Nassau go higher?\r\n\r\nIn the same spirit, but superior in tone and quality, is the following,\r\nthe authorship of which is unknown, \"on a poor but honest man:\"\r\n\r\n  Stop, reader, here, and deign to look\r\n    On one without a name,\r\n  Ne’er enter’d in the ample book\r\n    Of fortune or of fame.\r\n  Studious of peace, he hated strife;\r\n    Meek virtues fill’d his breast;\r\n  His coat of arms, \"a spotless life,\"\r\n    \"An honest heart\" his crest.\r\n  Quarter’d therewith was innocence,\r\n    And thus his motto ran:\r\n  \"A conscience void of all offence,\r\n    Before both God and man.\"\r\n  In the great day of wrath, through pride\r\n    Now scorns his pedigree,\r\n  Thousands shall wish they’d been allied\r\n    To this great family.\r\n\r\nThe thought in Prior’s is ludicrously expressed in the following, from a\r\nmonument erected in 1703, in the New Church burying-ground, Dundee, to the\r\nmemory of J. R.\r\n\r\n  Here lies a Man,\r\n  Com’d of Adam and Eve;\r\n  If any will climb higher,\r\n  I give him leave.\r\n\r\nAmongst poetical epitaphs, of the more elaborate class, we must notice two\r\nby Mason; one to the memory of his mother, in Bristol Cathedral, and the\r\nother on a young lady named Drummond, in the church of Brodsworth,\r\nYorkshire. We have space for only the latter.\r\n\r\n  Here sleeps what once was beauty, once was grace;\r\n    Grace, that with tenderness and sense combined\r\n  To form that harmony of soul and face,\r\n    Where brainy shines the mirror of the mind.\r\n  Such was the maid that, in the morn of youth,\r\n    In virgin innocence, in nature’s pride,\r\n  Blest with each art that owes its charms to truth,\r\n    Sank in her father’s fond embrace, and died.\r\n  He weeps; O venerate the holy tear!\r\n    Faith lends her aid to ease affliction’s load;\r\n  The parent mourns his child upon the bier,\r\n    The Christian yields an angel to his God.\r\n\r\nOf whimsical and satirical epitaphs—some actually inscribed on tombstones,\r\nand others intended for pasquinades—a large collection might be made. We\r\nhave little taste for these anomalous compositions, nor do we consider it\r\ncreditable to the national character, that so many English churchyards can\r\nbe pointed out where they occur. But there are those who will make even\r\nthe tomb a subject of pleasant humors. The epitaph for the tomb of Sir\r\nJohn Vanbrugh, distinguished as a dramatist and architect, and reflecting\r\non his achievements in the latter capacity, is as follows:\r\n\r\n  Lie heavy on him, Earth, for he\r\n  Laid many a heavy load on thee.\r\n\r\nThe original of the following is among the epigrams of Boileau:—\r\n\r\n  Here lies my wife; there let her lie;\r\n  She is at rest—and so am I.\r\n\r\nWe do not suppose that this was ever engraved on a tombstone, either in\r\nFrench or English; but the following lines are said to have been copied\r\nfrom a slab in an English church:—\r\n\r\n  Here lies the body of Sarah Sexton,\r\n  Who as a wife did never vex one;\r\n  We can’t say that for her at the next stone.\r\n\r\nThe next specimen is also known to have appeared on a tomb in Essex:—\r\n\r\n  Here lies the man Richard,\r\n    And Mary his wife;\r\n  Their surname was Pritchard;\r\n    They lived without strife;\r\n  And the reason was plain;\r\n    They abounded in riches,\r\n  They no care had nor pain,\r\n    And the wife wore the breeches.\r\n\r\nWe will not multiply examples of these compositions. Lines of the\r\ndescription we have quoted have often found their way into print, and we\r\nhave selected one or two of the least offensive as examples of\r\neccentricity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GOOD OLD TIMES IN PARIS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        AN ADVENTURE WITH ROBBERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom Chamber’s Edinburgh Journal.\r\n\r\nThe world, since it was a world at all, has ever been fond of singing the\r\npraises of the good old times. It would seem a general rule, that so soon\r\nas we get beyond a certain age, whatever that may be, we acquire a high\r\nopinion of the past, and grumble at every thing new under the sun. One\r\ncause of this may be, that distance lends enchantment to the view, and\r\nthat the history of the past, like a landscape travelled over, loses in\r\nreview all the rugged and wearisome annoyances that rendered it scarcely\r\nbearable in the journey. But it is hardly worth while to speculate upon\r\nthe causes of an absurdity which a little candid retrospection will do\r\nmore to dissipate than whole folios of philosophy. We can easily\r\nunderstand a man who sighs that he was not born a thousand years hence\r\ninstead of twenty or thirty years ago, but that any one should encourage a\r\nregret that his lot in life was not cast a few centuries back, seems\r\ninexplicable on any rational grounds. The utter folly of praising the good\r\nold times may be illustrated by a reference to the wretched condition of\r\nmost European cities; but we shall confine ourselves to the single case of\r\nParis, now one of the most beautiful capitals in the world.\r\n\r\nIn the thirteenth century the streets of Paris were not paved; they were\r\nmuddy and filthy to a very horrible degree, and swine constantly loitered\r\nabout and fed in them. At night there were no public lights, and\r\nassassinations and robberies were far from infrequent. At the beginning of\r\nthe fourteenth century public lighting was begun on a limited scale; and\r\nat best only a few tallow candles were put up in prominent situations. The\r\nimprovement, accordingly, did little good, and the numerous bands of\r\nthieves had it still pretty much their own way. Severity of punishment\r\nseldom compensates the want of precautionary measures. It was the general\r\ncustom at this period to cut off the ears of a condemned thief after the\r\nterm of his imprisonment had elapsed. Thia was done that offenders might\r\nbe readily recognized should they dare again to enter the city, banishment\r\nfrom which was a part of the sentence of such as were destined to be\r\ncropped. But they often found it easier to fabricate false ears than to\r\ngain a livelihood away from the arena of their exploits; and this measure,\r\nsevere and cruel as it was, was found inefficient to rid the capital of\r\ntheir presence.\r\n\r\nAmong the various adventures with thieves, detailed by an author\r\ncontemporaneous with Louis XIII., the following affords a rich example of\r\nthe organization of the domestic brigands of the time, and of the wretched\r\nsecurity which the capital afforded to its inhabitants.\r\n\r\nA celebrated advocate named Polidamor had by his reputation for riches\r\naroused the covetousness of some chiefs of a band of brigands, who\r\nflattered themselves that could they catch him they would obtain\r\npossession of an important sum. They placed upon his track three bold\r\nfellows, who, after many fruitless endeavors, encountered him one evening\r\naccompanied only by a single lackey. Seizing fast hold of himself and\r\nattendant, they rifled him in a twinkling; and as he had accidentally left\r\nhis purse at home, they took his rich cloak of Spanish cloth and silk,\r\nwhich was quite new, and of great value. Polidamor, who at first resisted,\r\nfound himself compelled to yield to force, but asked as a favor to be\r\nallowed to redeem his mantle. This was agreed to at the price of thirty\r\npistoles; and the rogues appointed a rendezvous the next day, at six in\r\nthe evening, on the same spot, for the purpose of effecting the exchange.\r\nThey recommended him to come alone, assuring him that his life would be\r\nendangered should he appear accompanied with an escort. Polidamor repaired\r\nto the place at the appointed hour, and after a few moments of expectation\r\nhe saw a carriage approaching in which were seated four persons in the\r\ngarb of gentlemen. They descended from the vehicle, and one of them,\r\nadvancing towards the advocate, asked him in a low voice if he were not in\r\nsearch of a cloak of Spanish cloth and silk. The victim replied in the\r\naffirmative, and declared himself prepared to redeem it at the sum at\r\nwhich it had been taxed. The thieves having assured themselves that he was\r\nalone, seized him, and made him get into the carriage; and one of them\r\npresenting a pistol to his breast, bade him hold his tongue under pain of\r\ninstant death, while another blindfolded him. As the advocate trembled\r\nwith fear, they assured him that no harm was intended, and bade the\r\ncoachman drive on.\r\n\r\nAfter a rapid flight, which was yet long enough to inspire the prisoner\r\nwith deadly terror, the carriage stopped in front of a large mansion, the\r\ngate of which opened to receive them, and closed again as soon as they had\r\npassed the threshold. The robbers alighted with their captive, from whose\r\neyes they now removed the bandage. He was led into an immense saloon,\r\nwhere were a number of tables, upon which the choicest viands were\r\nprofusely spread, and seated at which was a company of gentlemanly-looking\r\npersonages, who chatted familiarly together, without the slightest\r\ndemonstration of confusion or alarm. His guardians again enjoined him to\r\nlay aside all fear, informed him that he was in good society, and that\r\nthey had brought him there solely that they might enjoy the pleasure of\r\nhis company at supper. In the mean while water was served to the guests,\r\nthat they might wash their hands before sitting at table. Every man took\r\nhis place, and a seat was assigned to Polidamor at the upper and\r\nprivileged end of the board. Astonished, or rather stupefied at the\r\nstrange circumstances of his adventure, he would willingly have abstained\r\nfrom taking any part in the repast; but he was compelled to make a show of\r\neating, in order to dissemble his mistrust and agitation. When the supper\r\nwas ended and the tables were removed, one of the gentlemen who had\r\nassisted in his capture accosted him with polite expressions of regret at\r\nhis want of appetite. During the interchange of courtesies which ensued,\r\none of the bandits took a lute, another a viol, and the party began to\r\namuse themselves with music. The advocate was then invited to walk into a\r\nneighboring room, where he perceived a considerable number of mantles\r\nranged in order. He was desired to select his own, and to count out the\r\nthirty pistoles agreed upon, together with one for coach-hire, and one\r\nmore for his share of the reckoning at supper. Polidamor, who had been\r\napprehensive that the drama of which his mantle had been the occasion\r\nmight have a very different _dénouement_, was but too well pleased to be\r\nquit at such a cost, and he took leave of the assembly with unfeigned\r\nexpressions of gratitude. The carriage was called, and before entering it\r\nhe was again blindfolded; his former conductors returned with him to the\r\nspot where he had been seized, where, removing the bandage from his eyes,\r\nthey allowed him to alight, presenting him at the same moment with a\r\nticket sealed with green wax, and having these words inscribed in large\r\nletters, _\"Freed by the Great Band_.\" This ticket was a passport securing\r\nhis mantle, purse, and person against all further assaults. Hastening to\r\nregain his residence with all speed, he was assailed at a narrow turning\r\nby three other rascals, who demanded his purse or his life. The advocate\r\ndrew his ticket from his pocket, though he had no great faith in it as a\r\npreservative, and presented it to the thieves. One of them, provided with\r\na dark lantern, read it, returned it, and recommended him to make haste\r\nhome, where he at last arrived in safety.\r\n\r\nEarly in the seventeenth century the Parisian rogues availed themselves of\r\nthe regulations against the use of snuff to pillage the snuff-takers. As\r\nthe sale of this article was forbidden by law to any but grocers and\r\napothecaries, and as even they could only retail it to persons provided\r\nwith the certificate of a medical man, the annoyance of such restrictions\r\nwas loudly complained of. The rogues, ever ready to profit by\r\ncircumstances, opened houses for gaming—at that period almost a universal\r\nvice—where \"snuff at discretion\" was a tempting bait to those long\r\naccustomed to a gratification all the more agreeable because it was\r\nforbidden. Here the snuff-takers were diligently plied with wine, and then\r\ncheated of their money; or, if too temperate or suspicious to drink to\r\nexcess, they were unceremoniously plundered in a sham quarrel. To such a\r\nlength was this practice carried, that an ordinance was at length issued\r\nin 1629, strictly forbidding all snuff-takers from assembling in public\r\nplaces or elsewhere, \"_pour satisfaire leur goût_!\"\r\n\r\nThe thieves of the good old times were not only more numerous in\r\nproportion to the population than they are at present, but were also\r\ndistinguished by greater audacity and cruelty. They had recourse to the\r\nmost diabolical ingenuity to subdue the resistance and to prevent the\r\noutcries of their victims. Under the rule of Henry IV. a band of brigands\r\narose, who, in the garb, and with the manners of gentlemen, introduced\r\nthemselves into the best houses under the pretext of private business, and\r\nwhen alone with the master, demanded his money at the dagger’s point. Some\r\nof them made use of a gag—a contrivance designated at the period the\r\n_poire d’angoisse_. This instrument was of a spherical shape, and pierced\r\nall over with small holes; it was forced into the mouth of the person\r\nintended to be robbed, and upon touching a spring sharp points protruded\r\nfrom every hole, at once inflicting the most horrible anguish, and\r\npreventing the sufferer from uttering a single cry. It could not be\r\nwithdrawn but by the use of the proper key, which contracted the spring.\r\nThis device was adopted universally by one savage band, and occasioned\r\nimmense misery not only in Paris but throughout France.\r\n\r\nAn Italian thief, an enterprising and ingenious rogue, adopted a singular\r\nexpedient for robbing women at their devotions in church. He placed\r\nhimself on his knees by the side of his intended prey, holding in a pair\r\nof artificial hands a book of devotion, to which he made a show of the\r\nmost devout attention, while with his natural hands he cut the watch or\r\npurse-string of his unsuspecting neighbor. This stratagem, favored by the\r\nfashion, then general, of wearing mantles, met with great success, and of\r\ncourse soon produced a host of clumsy imitators, and excited the vigilance\r\nof the police, who at length made so many seizures of solemn-faced\r\ndevotees provided with wooden kid-gloved hands, that it fell into complete\r\ndiscredit, and was at last abandoned by the profession.\r\n\r\nCunning as were the rogues of a past age, they were liable to capture like\r\ntheir modern successors. A gentleman having resorted to Paris on business,\r\nwas hustled one day in the precincts of the palace, and robbed of his\r\nwell-filled purse. Furious at the loss of a considerable sum, he swore to\r\nbe avenged. He procured a clever mechanic, who, under his directions,\r\ncontrived a kind of hand-trap for the pocket, managed in such a manner as\r\nto preclude the possibility of an attempt at purse-stealing without\r\ndetection. Having fixed the instrument in its place, impatient for the\r\nrevenge he had promised himself, he sallied forth to promenade the public\r\nwalks, mingled with every group, and stopped from time to time gazing\r\nabout him with the air of a greenhorn. Several days passed before any\r\nthing resulted from his plan; but one morning, while he was gaping at the\r\nportraits of the kings of France in one of the public galleries, he finds\r\nhimself surrounded and pushed about, precisely as in the former instance;\r\nhe feels a hand insinuating itself gently into the open snare, and hears\r\nimmediately the click of the instrument, which assures him that the\r\ndelinquent is safely caught. Taking no notice, he walks on as if nothing\r\nhad happened, and resumes his promenade, drawing after him the thief, whom\r\npain and shame prevented from making the least effort to disengage his\r\nhand. Occasionally the gentleman would turn round, and rebuke his\r\nunwilling follower for his importunity, and thus drew the eyes of the\r\nwhole crowd upon his awkward position. At last, pretending to observe for\r\nthe first time the stranger’s hand in his pocket, he flies into a violent\r\npassion, accuses him of being a cut-purse, and demands the sum he had\r\npreviously lost, without which he declares the villain shall be hanged. It\r\nwould seem that compounding a felony was nothing in those days; for it is\r\nupon record that the thief, though caught in the act, was permitted to\r\nsend a messenger to his comrades, who advanced the money, and therewith\r\npurchased his liberty.\r\n\r\nThe people were forbidden to employ particular materials in the\r\nfabrication of their clothing, to ride in a coach, to decorate their\r\napartments as they chose, to purchase certain articles of furniture, and\r\neven to give a dinner party when and in what style they chose. Under the\r\nValois régime strict limits were assigned to the expenses of the table,\r\ndetermining the number of courses of which a banquet should consist, and\r\nthat of the dishes of which each course was to be composed. Any guest who\r\nshould fail to denounce an infraction of the law of which he had been a\r\nwitness, was liable to a fine of forty livres; and officers of justice,\r\nwho might be present, were strictly enjoined to quit the tables of their\r\nhosts, and institute immediate proceedings against them. The rigor of\r\nthese regulations extended, even to the kitchen, and the police had the\r\npower of entry at all hours, to enforce compliance with the statutes.\r\n\r\nBut it was during the prevalence of an epidemic that it was least\r\nagreeable to live in France in the good old times. No sooner did a\r\ncontagious malady, or one that was supposed to be so, make its appearance,\r\nthan the inhabitants of Paris were all forbidden to remove from one\r\nresidence to another, although their term of tenancy had expired, until\r\nthe judge of police had received satisfactory evidence that the house they\r\ndesired to leave had not been affected by the contagion. When a house was\r\ninfected, a bundle of straw fastened to one of the windows warned the\r\npublic to avoid all intercourse with the inmates. At a later period two\r\nwooden crosses were substituted for the straw, one of which was attached\r\nto the front door, and the other to one of the windows in an upper story.\r\nIn 1596 the provost of Paris having learned that the tenants of some\r\nhouses infected by an epidemic which was then making great ravages, had\r\nremoved these badges, issued an ordinance commanding that those who\r\ntransgressed in a similar manner again should suffer the loss of the right\r\nhand—a threat which was found perfectly efficient.\r\n\r\nBy an ordinance of 1533, persons recovering from a contagious malady,\r\ntogether with their domestics, and all the members of their families, were\r\nforbidden to appear in the streets for a given period without a white wand\r\nin their hands, to warn the public of the danger of contact. Three years\r\nafter the authorities were yet more severe against the convalescents, who\r\nwere ordered to remain shut up at home for forty days after their cure;\r\nand even when the quarantine had expired, they were not allowed to appear\r\nin the streets until they had presented to a magistrate a certificate from\r\nthe commissary of their district, attested by a declaration of six\r\nhouseholders, that the forty days had elapsed. In the preceding century\r\n(in 1498) an ordinance still more extraordinary had been issued. It was at\r\nthe coronation of Louis XII. when a great number of the nobles came to\r\nParis to take part in the ceremony. The provost, desiring to guard them\r\nfrom the danger of infection, published an order that all persons of both\r\nsexes, suffering under certain specified maladies, should quit the capital\r\nin twenty-four hours, _under the penalty of being thrown into the river_!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LEGEND OF THE WEEPING CHAMBER.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          From Household Words.\r\n\r\n\r\nA strange story was once told me by a Levantine lady of my acquaintance,\r\nwhich I shall endeavor to relate—as far as I am able with the necessary\r\nabridgments—in her own words. The circumstances under which she told it\r\nwere peculiar. The family had just been disturbed by the visit of a\r\nghost—a real ghost, visible, if not palpable. She was not what may be\r\ncalled superstitious; and though following with more or less assiduity the\r\npractices of her religion, was afflicted now and then with a fit of\r\nperfect materialism. I was surprised, therefore, to hear her relate, with\r\nevery appearance of profound faith, the following incidents:—\r\n\r\nThere is an old house in Beyrout, which, for many successive years, was\r\ninhabited by a Christian family. It is of great extent, and was of yore\r\nfitted for the dwelling of a prince. The family had, indeed, in\r\nearly-times been very rich; and almost fabulous accounts are current of\r\nthe wealth of its founder, Fadlallah Dahân. He was a merchant; the owner\r\nof ships, the fitter-out of caravans. The regions of the East and of the\r\nWest had been visited by him; and, after undergoing as many dangers and\r\nadventures as Sinbad, he had returned to spend the latter days of his life\r\nin his native city. He built, accordingly, a magnificent dwelling, the\r\ncourts of which he adorned with marble fountains, and the chambers with\r\nsilk divans; and he was envied on account of his prosperity.\r\n\r\nBut, in the restlessness of his early years, he had omitted to marry, and\r\nnow found himself near the close of his career without an heir to inherit\r\nhis wealth and to perpetuate his name. This reflection often disturbed\r\nhim; yet he was unwilling to take a wife because he was old. Every now and\r\nthen, it is true, he saw men older than he, with fewer teeth and whiter\r\nbeards, taking to their bosoms maidens that bloomed like peaches just\r\nbeginning to ripen against a wall; and his friends, who knew he would give\r\na magnificent marriage-feast, urged him to do likewise. Once he looked\r\nwith pleasure on a young person of not too tender years, whose parents\r\npurposely presented her to him; but having asked her in a whisper whether\r\nshe would like to marry a withered old gentleman like himself, she frankly\r\nconfessed a preference for his handsome young clerk, Harma, who earned a\r\nhundred piastres a month. Fadlallah laughed philosophically, and took care\r\nthat the young couple should be married under happy auspices.\r\n\r\nOne day he was proceeding along the street gravely and slowly—surrounded\r\nby a number of merchants proud to walk by his side, and followed by two or\r\nthree young men, who pressed near in order to be thought of the company,\r\nand thus establish their credit—when an old woman espying him, began to\r\ncry out, \"Yeh! yeh! this is the man who has no wife and no child—this is\r\nthe man who is going to die and leave his fortune to be robbed by his\r\nservants or confiscated by the governor! And yet, he has a sagacious\r\nnose\"—(the Orientals have observed that there is wisdom in a nose)—\"and a\r\nbeard as long as my back! Yeh! yeh! what a wonderful sight to see!\"\r\n\r\nFadlallah Dahân stopped, and retorted, smiling: \"Yeh! yeh! this is the\r\nwoman that blames an old man for not marrying a young wife. Yeh! yeh! what\r\na wonderful sight to see!\"\r\n\r\nThen the woman replied, \"O my lord, every pig’s tail curls not in the same\r\ndirection, nor does every maiden admire the passing quality of youth. If\r\nthou wilt, I will bestow on thee a wife, who will love thee as thou lovest\r\nthyself, and serve thee as the angels serve Allah. She is more beautiful\r\nthan any of the daughters of Beyrout, and her name is Selima, a name of\r\ngood augury.\"\r\n\r\nThe friends of Fadlallah laughed, as did the young men who followed in\r\ntheir wake, and urged him to go and see this peerless beauty, if it were\r\nonly for a joke. Accordingly, he told the woman to lead the way. But she\r\nsaid he must mount his mule, for they had to go some distance into the\r\ncountry. He mounted, and, with a single servant, went forth from the\r\ngates—the woman preceding—and rode until he reached a village in the\r\nmountains. Here, in a poor little house, he found Selima; clothed in the\r\nvery commonest style, engaged in making divan cushions. She was a\r\nmarvellously beautiful girl, and the heart of the merchant at once began\r\nto yearn towards her; yet he endeavored to restrain himself, and said,\r\n\"This beautiful thing is not for me.\" But the woman cried out, \"Selima,\r\nwilt thou consent to love this old man?\" The girl gazed in his face\r\nawhile, and then, folding her hands across her bosom, said, \"Yes; for\r\nthere is goodness in his countenance.\" Fadlallah wept with joy; and,\r\nreturning to the city, announced his approaching marriage to his friends.\r\nAccording to custom, they expressed civil surprise to his face; but, when\r\nhis back was turned, they whispered that he was an old fool, and had been\r\nthe dupe of a she-adventurer.\r\n\r\nThe marriage took place with ceremonies of royal magnificence; and Selima,\r\nwho passed unmoved from extreme poverty to abundant riches, seemed to\r\nmerit the position of the greatest lady in Beyrout. Never was woman more\r\nprudent than she. No one ever knew her previous history, nor that of her\r\nmother. Some said that a life of misery, perhaps of shame, was before\r\nthem, when this unexpected marriage took place. Selima’s gratitude to\r\nFadlallah was unbounded; and out of gratitude grew love. The merchant\r\ndaily offered up thanks for the bright diamond which had come to shine in\r\nhis house.\r\n\r\nIn due time a child was born; a boy lively as his mother; and they named\r\nhim Halil. With what joy he was received, what festivities announced the\r\nglad intelligence to the town, may easily be imagined. Selima and\r\nFadlallah resolved to devote themselves to his education, and determined\r\nthat he should be the most accomplished youth of Bar-er-Shâm. But a long\r\nsuccession of children followed, each more beautiful than the former—some\r\nboys, some girls; and every new comer was received with additional delight\r\nand still grander ceremonies; so that the people began to say, \"Is this a\r\nrace of sovereigns?\"\r\n\r\nNow, Halil grew up to the age of twelve—still a charming lad; but the\r\nparents always fully occupied by the last arrival, had not carried out\r\ntheir project of education. He was as wild and untamed as a colt, and\r\nspent more of his time in the street than in the company of his mother;\r\nwho, by degrees, began to look upon him with a kind of calm friendship due\r\nto strangers. Fadlallah, as he took his accustomed walk with his merchant\r\nfriends, used from time to time to encounter a ragged boy fighting in the\r\nstreets with the sons of the Jew butcher; but his eyes beginning to grow\r\ndim, he often passed without recognizing him. One day, however, Halil,\r\nbreathless and bleeding, ran up and took refuge beneath the skirts of his\r\nmantle from a crowd of savage urchins. Fadlallah was amazed, and said, \"O,\r\nmy son—for I think thou art my son—what evil hath befallen thee, and\r\nwherefore do I see thee in this state?\" The boy, whose voice was choked by\r\nsobs, looked up into his face, and said, \"Father, I am the son of the\r\nrichest merchant of Beyrout, and behold, there is no one so little cared\r\nfor as I.\"\r\n\r\nFadlallah’s conscience smote him, and he wiped the boy’s bleeding face\r\nwith the corner of his silk caftan, and blessed him; and, taking him by\r\nthe hand, led him away. The merchants smiled benignly one to the other,\r\nand, pointing with their thumbs, said, \"We have seen the model youth!\"\r\n\r\nWhilst they laughed and sneered, Fadlallah, humbled yet resolved, returned\r\nto his house, leading the ragged Halil, and entered his wife’s chamber.\r\nSelima was playing with her seventh child, and teaching it to lisp the\r\nword \"Baba\"—about the amount of education which she had found time to\r\nbestow on each of her offspring. When she saw the plight of her eldest son\r\nshe frowned, and was about to scold him; but Fadlallah interposed, and\r\nsaid, \"Wife, speak no harsh words. We have not done our duty by this boy.\r\nMay God forgive us; but we have looked on these children that have bloomed\r\nfrom thee, more as playthings than as deposits for which we are\r\nresponsible. Halil has become a wild out-of-doors lad, doubting with some\r\nreason of our love. It is too late to bring him back to the destiny we had\r\ndreamt of; but he must not be left to grow up thus uncared for. I have a\r\nbrother established in Bassora; to him will I send the lad to learn the\r\narts of commerce, and to exercise himself in adventure, as his father did\r\nbefore him. Bestow thy blessing upon him, Selima (here the good old man’s\r\nvoice trembled), and may God in his mercy forgive both thee and me for the\r\nneglect which has made this parting necessary. I shall know that I am\r\nforgiven, if, before I go down into the tomb, my son return a wise and\r\nsober man; not unmindful that we gave him life, and forgetting that, until\r\nnow, we have given him little else.\"\r\n\r\nSelima laid her seventh child in its cradle of carved wood, and drew Halil\r\nto her bosom; and Fadlallah knew that she loved him still, because she\r\nkissed his face, regardless of the blood and dirt that stained it. She\r\nthen washed him and dressed him, and gave him a purse of gold, and handed\r\nhim over to his father; who had resolved to send him off by the caravan\r\nthat started that very afternoon. Halil, surprised and made happy by\r\nunwonted caresses, was yet delighted at the idea of beginning an\r\nadventurous life; and went away, manfully stifling his sobs, and\r\nendeavoring to assume the grave deportment of a merchant. Selima shed a\r\nfew tears, and then, attracted by a crow and a chuckle from the cradle,\r\nbegan to tickle the infant’s soft double chin, and went on with her\r\ninterrupted lesson, \"Baba, Baba!\"\r\n\r\nHalil started on his journey, and having passed through the Valley of\r\nRobbers, the Valley of Lions, and the Valley of Devils—this is the way in\r\nwhich Orientals localize the supposed dangers of travelling—arrived at the\r\ngood city of Bassora; where his uncle received him well, and promised to\r\nsend him, as supercargo on board the first vessel he dispatched to the\r\nIndian seas. What time was spent by the caravan upon the road, the\r\nnarrative does not state. Travelling is slow work in the East; but almost\r\nimmediately on his arrival in Bassora, Halil was engaged in a love\r\nadventure. If travelling is slow, the approaches of manhood are rapid. The\r\nyouth’s curiosity was excited by the extraordinary care taken to conceal\r\nhis cousin Miriam from his sight; and having introduced himself into her\r\ngarden, beheld, and, struck by her wonderful beauty, loved her. With an\r\nOriental fondness he confessed the truth to his uncle, who listened with\r\nanger and dismay, and told him that Miriam was betrothed to the Sultan.\r\nHalil perceived the danger of indulging his passion, and promised to\r\nsuppress it; but whilst he played a prudent part, Miriam’s curiosity was\r\nalso excited, and she too beheld and loved her cousin. Bolts and bars\r\ncannot keep two such affections asunder. They met and plighted their troth\r\nand were married secretly, and were happy. But inevitable discovery came.\r\nMiriam was thrown into a dungeon; and the unhappy Halil, loaded with\r\nchains, was put on board a vessel, not as supercargo, but as prisoner,\r\nwith orders that he should be left in some distant country.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile a dreadful pestilence fell upon Beyrout, and among the first\r\nsufferers was an eighth little one that had just learned to say \"Baba!\"\r\nSelima was almost too astonished to be grieved. It seemed to her\r\nimpossible that death should come into her house, and meddle with the\r\nfruits of so much suffering and love. When they came to take away the\r\nlittle form which she had so often fondled, her indignation burst forth,\r\nand she smote the first old woman who stretched out her rough\r\nunsympathetic hand. But a shriek from her waiting-woman announced that\r\nanother victim was singled out; and the frantic mother rushed like a\r\ntigress to defend the young that yet remained to her. But the enemy was\r\ninvisible; and (so the story goes) all her little ones drooped one by one\r\nand died; so that on the seventh day Selima sat in her nursery gazing\r\nabout with stony eyes, and counting her losses upon her fingers—Iskender,\r\nSelima, Wardy, Fadlallah, Hanna, Hennenah, Gereges—seven in all. Then she\r\nremembered Halil, and her neglect of him; and, lifting up her voice, she\r\nwept aloud; and, as the tears rushed fast and hot down her cheeks, her\r\nheart yearned for her absent boy, and she would have parted with worlds to\r\nhave fallen upon his breast—would have given up her life in return for one\r\nword of pardon and of love.\r\n\r\nFadlallah came in to her; and he was now very old and feeble. His back was\r\nbent, and his transparent hand trembled as it clutched a cane. A white\r\nbeard surrounded a still whiter face; and as he came near his wife, he\r\nheld out his hand towards her with an uncertain gesture, as if the room\r\nhad been dark. This world appeared to him but dimly. \"Selima,\" said he,\r\n\"the Giver hath taken. We, too, must go in our turn. Weep, my love, but\r\nweep with moderation, for those little ones that have gone to sing in the\r\ngolden cages of Paradise. There is a heavier sorrow in my heart. Since my\r\nfirst-born, Halil, departed for Bassora, I have only written once to learn\r\nintelligence of him. He was then well, and had been received with favor by\r\nhis uncle. We have never done our duty by that boy.\" His wife replied, \"Do\r\nnot reproach me; for I reproach myself more bitterly than thou canst do.\r\nWrite, then, to thy brother to obtain tidings of the beloved one. I will\r\nmake of this chamber a weeping chamber. It has resounded with merriment\r\nenough. All my children learned to laugh and to talk here. I will hang it\r\nwith black, and erect a tomb in the midst; and every day I will come and\r\nspend two hours, and weep for those who are gone and for him who is\r\nabsent.\" Fadlallah approved her design; and they made a weeping chamber,\r\nand lamented together every day therein. But their letters to Bassora\r\nremained unanswered; and they began to believe that fate had chosen a\r\nsolitary tomb for Halil.\r\n\r\nOne day a woman, dressed in the garb of the poor, came to the house of\r\nFadlallah with a boy about twelve years old. When the merchant saw them he\r\nwas struck with amazement, for he beheld in the boy the likeness of his\r\nson Halil; and he called aloud to Selima, who, when she came, shrieked\r\nwith amazement. The woman told her story, and it appeared that she was\r\nMiriam. Having spent some months in prison, she had escaped and taken\r\nrefuge in a forest in the house of her nurse. Here she had given birth to\r\na son, whom she had called by his father’s name. When her strength\r\nreturned, she had set out as a beggar to travel over the world in search\r\nof her lost husband. Marvellous were the adventures she underwent, God\r\nprotecting her throughout, until she came to the land of Persia, where she\r\nfound Halil working as a slave in the garden of the Governor of Fars.\r\nAfter a few stolen interviews, she had again resumed her wanderings to\r\nseek for Fadlallah, that he might redeem his son with wealth; but had\r\npassed several years upon the road.\r\n\r\nFortune, however, now smiled upon this unhappy family, and in spite of his\r\nage, Fadlallah set out for Fars. Heaven made the desert easy, and the road\r\nshort for him. On a fine calm evening he entered the gardens of the\r\ngovernor, and found his son gaily singing as he trimmed an orange tree.\r\nAfter a vain attempt to preserve an incognito, the good old man lifted up\r\nhis hands, and shouting, \"Halil, my first-born!\" fell upon the breast of\r\nthe astonished slave. Sweet was the interview in the orange grove, sweet\r\nthe murmured conversation between the strong young man and the trembling\r\npatriarch, until the perfumed dew of evening fell upon their heads.\r\nHalil’s liberty was easily obtained, and father and son returned in safety\r\nto Beyrout. Then the Weeping Chamber was closed, and the door walled up;\r\nand Fadlallah and Selima lived happily until age gently did its work at\r\ntheir appointed times: and Halil and Miriam inherited the house and the\r\nwealth that had been gathered for them.\r\n\r\nThe supernatural part of the story remains to be told. The Weeping Chamber\r\nwas never again opened; but every time that a death was about to occur in\r\nthe family, a shower of heavy tear-drops was heard to fall upon its marble\r\nfloor, and low wailings came through the walled doorway. Years, centuries\r\npassed away, and the mystery repeated itself with unvarying uniformity.\r\nThe family fell into poverty, and only occupied a portion of the house,\r\nbut invariably before one of its members sickened unto death, a shower of\r\nheavy drops, as from a thunder-cloud, pattered on the pavement of the\r\nWeeping Chamber, and was heard distinctly at night through the whole\r\nhouse. At length the family quitted the country in search of better\r\nfortunes elsewhere, and the house remained for a long time uninhabited.\r\n\r\nThe lady who narrated the story went to live in the house, and passed some\r\nyears without being disturbed; but one night she was lying awake, and\r\ndistinctly heard the warning shower dripping heavily in the Weeping\r\nChamber. Next day the news came of her mother’s death, and she hastened to\r\nremove to another dwelling. The house has since been utterly abandoned to\r\nrats, mice, beetles, and an occasional ghost seen sometimes streaming\r\nalong the rain-pierced terraces. No one has ever attempted to violate the\r\nsolitude of the sanctuary where Selima wept for the seven little ones\r\ntaken to the grave, and for the absent one whom she had treated with\r\nunmotherly neglect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BULL FIGHT OF MADRID.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    BY THE AUTHOR OF \"THE CASTILIAN.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was one of those clear, bright days, peculiar to a Spanish summer, when\r\nthe deep blue skies seem to reflect their warmth in radiance over the\r\nearth; a slumberous influence hung over the tranquil streets of Madrid,\r\nand although it was still early in the morning, the fervid rays of the sun\r\ngave a certain indication of the meridian power he was about to display in\r\na few hours.\r\n\r\nSuch was the day appropriated for the splendid and soul-stirring\r\ncelebration of a bull-fight; and accordingly, the inhabitants soon began,\r\nby an unusual bustle, to evince the absorbing interest they are accustomed\r\nto take in this favorite amusement. Before the hour of nine, the beautiful\r\nstreet of Alcala was thronged with a promiscuous multitude, eager to\r\nwitness the first exhibition of the morning; the Spanish bull-fight being\r\nin fact composed of two acts, if I may so term them, the morning and the\r\nevening encounters.\r\n\r\nOn such days, a general cessation of labor takes place throughout the\r\ncity, and the whole population is occupied with speculations on the\r\napproaching festival. On the morning in question, the inhabitants of\r\nMadrid, the lower classes in particular, attired in their holiday finery,\r\nbegan at an early hour to issue from their narrow and obscure dormitories,\r\nand, with tolerably cleanly appearance and much importance of demeanor, to\r\ntake up a position in that famous _Puerta del sol_ which, on less\r\nmomentous occasions, seems destined only as a lounge for all the\r\n_ennuyés_, news-hunters, and _petit-maitres_ of Madrid. The Manolos, too,\r\nbegan to congregate in great numbers, casting around those terrible\r\nglances of recklessness and conscious courage, which, in the estimation of\r\nforeigners, are the certain prognostics of as many concealed daggers.\r\n\r\nI soon made up my mind to add one to the vast concourse now on the alert\r\nto witness this grand and terrific spectacle, although, for many reasons,\r\nI prudently resolved to postpone my share of the entertainment until the\r\nevening.\r\n\r\nIt is at this hour that the higher classes prefer visiting the arena: a\r\nnumber of the more desperate _amateurs_, however, regardless of the\r\ninfluence of a meridian sun, do not hesitate to present themselves at the\r\nmorning exhibitions.\r\n\r\nAt about four in the afternoon, the _Calle de Alcala_ was, if possible,\r\nmore crowded than it had been in the morning. This majestic street, which\r\ncommands a full view of the superb triumphal arch which bears its name,\r\nnow presented a most striking and animated scene: various groups,\r\nfancifully contrasted in dress and deportment, were all hurrying towards\r\nthe same spot. Here you might see the gorgeous equipage of the haughty\r\ngrandee, sweeping by in all the imposing consciousness of pomp and\r\ngreatness, while carriages of more humble pretensions were rattling as\r\nbriskly, if not as proudly, along the gay and lively street. The\r\n_Calesines_, too, were seen in great numbers hurrying to the scene of\r\nanticipated pleasure, and diversifying, by the singularity of their\r\nappearance, and the ringing of small bells, the stately _cortege_ of more\r\nsplendid equipages.\r\n\r\nNext, an army of _majos_ attracted attention by their fanciful dresses,\r\nand the easy swagger with which they accompanied their _morenas_, who were\r\nnot the less conspicuous for their graceful though somewhat confident\r\ndemeanor. They were all, of course, attired in their peculiar costume,\r\nbedizened with ribbons, and the short saya reaching only to the middle of\r\nthe calf, and showing the most polished ancle and the prettiest foot in\r\nthe world. These gay and lively individuals were picturesquely contrasted\r\nwith crowds of monks and friars, of all orders and colors—\r\n\r\n  White, black, and gray, with all their trumpery—\r\n\r\nhere and there intermingled with military idlers, in the uniforms of their\r\nseveral regiments.\r\n\r\nHere you might see the rosy and jolly abbate, ambling along upon a mule,\r\nhaving an appearance scarcely less clerical than himself, jostling the\r\nless fortunate friar on the back of the humbler donkey, and the sturdy\r\nmendicant, as he strode along on foot, supported only by his staff. The\r\nstreets, and every avenue leading to the _Plaza de los Toros_, were lined\r\nwith noisy vendors of delicious fruits, who made a grateful display upon\r\ntheir stalls of the Seville orange and the cooling water-melon; whilst a\r\nnumber of Valencians carried about large _vasijas_, or trays of lemonade,\r\nand other refreshments, for the accommodation of the thirsty pedestrians,\r\nwho had no time to squander upon a visit to the _neveras_, or ice-houses.\r\nThe effect of this animated picture was farther heightened by the cries of\r\nthe venders, the harmony of some neighboring barber’s guitar, the\r\ncontinual jingling of the mules’ bells, and the clicking of castanets.\r\n\r\nAmidst this stunning, yet not unpleasing variety of sounds, we at length\r\nreached the _Plaza de los Toros_, and it was with some difficulty we\r\nobtained places in the stage seats. A vast concourse of persons of all\r\nclasses were already assembled, and I observed with a smile the effect\r\nwhich the novelty of the scene had produced upon an English friend, whom I\r\nhad, with great difficulty, prevailed upon to accompany me; having, as he\r\ndeclared, but little taste for such brutal and demoralizing exhibitions.\r\nHe seemed quite excited, and made some passing observation relative to the\r\nRoman Circus, to which the present exhibition bore no unapt resemblance. I\r\ndirected his attention to many of his countrymen, as well as other\r\nforeigners, who, after having been quite as clamorous as himself against\r\nthe sport, had terminated their philosophical philippics by becoming\r\nconstant visitors both at the morning and afternoon encounters. We arrived\r\nat the scene of action just in time to witness _El despejo_, or the\r\nclearing of the arena; a ceremony which is effected by a band of soldiers,\r\nwho enter the place and drive every loiterer away, to the sound of drums\r\nand fifes. In a few minutes, not a single person was to be seen in the\r\ncircus; and, consequently, the body of spectators, thus driven back upon\r\nthe crowd, gave rise to various energetic expostulations, hearty curses,\r\nand not a few random cuffs. The only inconvenience, however, of these\r\nfrequent _melées_, was the loss of a few ribbons and a quantity of hair,\r\nof which the _manolus_ most assiduously set about easing themselves. This\r\noperation is a source of considerable amusement to those who stand aloof\r\nfrom the field of strife. We had been happy in securing good places, and\r\nhad nothing to complain of but the immediate vicinity of an amateur, or\r\n_aficionado_, who kept his tongue in continual motion, and favored his\r\nneighbors with a tremendous display of erudition on the _tauromachia_.\r\n\r\nWhilst the immense multitude were beguiling their impatience in a thousand\r\nways, and among others by bandying jests—eating\r\noranges—smoking—whistling—love-making and quarrelling—the champions of the\r\nfète, namely, the _picadores_, the _espadas_, and the _chulos_, were very\r\npiously engaged in prayer in a chapel contiguous to the circus, it being\r\ncustomary for combatants to solicit the protection of the holy Virgin\r\nagainst the tremendous animal they are about to encounter before they\r\nventure to provoke its ferocity.\r\n\r\nWhile they proceed in their laudable occupation, we will return to the\r\ncircus, which now presented a most striking spectacle. The corregidor and\r\nthe corporation of the town had already taken their seats near the\r\nsplendid box fitted up for the use of the king, directly opposite to the\r\nentrance from which the bull was expected to rush into the arena. Above\r\nthis entrance was a platform, occupied by a band of musicians, who\r\ncontinued at intervals to mingle their animating strains with the clamor\r\nof the noisy multitude. An officer of the town now entered the arena,\r\nmounted on a fine charger. He was dressed in complete sables, and carried\r\nin his hand the staff of office. Attended by alguazils, he\r\nadvanced,—saluted the box where the king was _not_,—and then proceeded to\r\nthe master of the ceremonies, from whom he received the keys of the cells,\r\nwhere the terrible animals who were to take so conspicuous parts in the\r\nevening spectacle were confined.\r\n\r\nAt this critical juncture, a breathless silence pervaded the spectators,\r\nwho by their eager looks evinced the absorbing interest they took in the\r\nsoul-stirring spectacle. Anon, a band of martial instruments struck up;—a\r\ngeneral buzz arose on every side, and, amidst the overwhelming din that\r\nprevailed throughout the circus, the _picadores_ and the rest of their\r\nparty made their entrance into the arena. First came the _picadores_, with\r\ntheir horses blindfold, wearing enormous boots to protect them from the\r\nblows of the bull; next paced on the _espadas_, or _matadores_, on foot,\r\nattired in rich silk dresses, each wearing a robe of a different color,\r\ntogether with ribbons or some other distinctive mark of favor from his\r\nmistress. The procession closed with a numerous troop of _chulos_, or\r\n_banderilleros_, a set of young men lightly and fancifully apparelled,\r\nwhose business is to distract the attention of the bull from a fallen\r\ncavalier, and to harass the animal with the _banderillas_. In this\r\nsplendid troop we perceived some traces of the ancient spirit of chivalry,\r\nalthough, strange to say, the favorite sport of the fine cavaliers of the\r\nland is now confined to the lowest orders. It is only from the\r\nslaughter-house that the bull-fighters now, for the most part, proceed.\r\n\r\nThe procession moved on, at a slow and stately pace, amidst strains of\r\nmusic and the vociferations of the lower classes, many of whom soon\r\nrecognized in the heroes of the fète, some near relation, some dear\r\nfriend, or at least, well-known acquaintance, whom they were desirous of\r\nencouraging by their shouts. The champions having made their respective\r\nobeisances to the royal box and to the corregidor, retired to the places\r\nset apart for them in the arena.\r\n\r\nThe _picadores_, according to the order of precedence, ranged themselves\r\nin the circus, close to the _baranda_, or wooden barrier, which, though\r\nelevated to the height of five feet, is sometimes scarcely sufficient to\r\nprevent the most furious amongst the bulls from breaking over it. Suddenly\r\nthe music ceased—the silence was intense—the signal is given—the doors\r\nwere flung open—and, with one tremendous burst, forth sprang the bull into\r\nthe middle of the circus! It was a fearful animal; not large, but of that\r\npeculiar color and breed which are accounted the most ferocious.\r\n\r\n  Dark is his hide on either side, but the blood within doth boil,\r\n  And the dun hide glows as if on fire, as he paws to the turmoil,\r\n  His eyes are jet, and they are set in crystal rings of snow;\r\n  But now they stare with one red glare of brass upon the foe.\r\n  Upon the forehead of the bull the horns stand close and near,\r\n  From out the broad and wrinkled skull like daggers they appear;\r\n  His neck is massy, like the trunk of some old knotted tree,\r\n  Whereon the monster’s shagged mane like billows curled ye see.\r\n  His legs are short, his hams are thick, his hoofs are black as night,\r\n  Like a strong flail he holds his tail in the fierceness of his might;\r\n  Like something molten out of iron, or hewn forth from the rock,\r\n  Harpado of Xarama stands, to bide the Alcayde’s shock.(6)\r\n\r\nThe appearance of the bull was hailed by loud acclamations from the\r\nmultitude; whilst hats, handkerchiefs, and scarfs fluttered in the air, in\r\nevery direction.\r\n\r\nThe noble animal appeared at first as though he were undecided how to act,\r\nor on whom to wreak his fierce vengeance. He turned on every side, and\r\nscanned the appalling number and firmness of his tormentors; gradually he\r\nbecame more and more excited, till, exasperated by the clamors of the\r\nimpatient multitude, he tore the ground with his hoofs, tossed his head in\r\nproud indignation, and then stared intently before him, as if to awe the\r\ncircus with the lightnings of his angry eye. Again he lowered his head,\r\nand blew the dust in clouds with the burning breath of his distended\r\nnostrils, and lashed his sides with his tail, as if to work himself up to\r\nthe proper pitch of frenzy; at length, with a sudden bound, he rushed\r\nfuriously against the first _picador_. The cavalier received the charge\r\nwith perfect coolness and intrepidity, and having succeeded in planting\r\nhis _pica_ in the higher part of the animal’s neck, the theatre rung with\r\nacclamations at the strength and dexterity with which he kept his\r\ntremendous opponent for some moments fixed to the spot. Smarting with\r\npain, the bull then retired for a short time; but his rage prevailing over\r\nhis fears, he again rushed forward, and was received by a second\r\n_picador_. Less fortunate, however, than his companion, he was unable to\r\nwithstand the overwhelming shock; and, after a fruitless effort to stem\r\nthe animal’s fury with his _pica_, it at length broke, and the bull, with\r\none tremendous thrust on the horse’s breast, overthrew its rider.\r\nFortunately for the fallen _picador_, he was protected by the bulk of his\r\nhorse; and the bull, as it often happens, sated his fierceness on the\r\nhelpless animal, whose blood spouted round the arena, from a wound\r\nevidently mortal. The excitement of the spectators now became intense;\r\nwhen the bull, having fully disabled his enemy, advanced toward the third\r\ncavalier. The champion, however, had penetration enough to perceive that\r\nthe bull was of a dangerous kind, and evinced no particular solicitude to\r\ncome to closer quarters with him. He kept, therefore, retreating, under\r\npretext of gaining an advantageous position; but the people, who guessed\r\nhis real motive, unanimously protested against such dilatory proceedings.\r\nMen and women, old and young, began to assail the luckless, or rather,\r\nprudent _picador_, with a violent storm of abuse.\r\n\r\nDuring the whole of this noisy altercation, our erudite neighbor, the\r\n_aficionado_, had been very scientifically descanting on the various\r\npoints of the combat, to our no small annoyance; for he could not rest a\r\nmoment in his seat, and was continually intercepting our view. The\r\n_picador_, provoked by the bitter sarcasms lavished upon him by the more\r\nvulgar part of the spectators, now advanced with an air of determination a\r\nlittle farther into the arena; but the sagacious bull kept retreating as\r\nhis enemy advanced, in order to render escape more difficult, and his\r\nvengeance certain. At length he rushed on the cavalier with such fury and\r\noverwhelming force, that both _picador_ and horse rolled on the ground:\r\nunluckily, the man not being very dexterous, could seek no protection from\r\nthe horse, but lay exposed to the fury of his powerful antagonist.\r\n\r\nCries of horror and alarm for the safety of the unfortunate _picador_ were\r\nnow heard on every side, and strange to say, those very persons, who had\r\nbut just driven him to encounter the danger, were now the most clamorous\r\nin shouting for protection for him. The _chulos_ lost no time in applying\r\ntheir art to extricate their companion, by harassing the animal on all\r\nsides, who was thus compelled to abandon his prey in order to meet his new\r\ntormentors. Thus the fallen cavalier was rescued from his jeopardy, whilst\r\nhis poor horse, dreadfully gored, ran wildly about the arena. The bull, as\r\nif satisfied with these feats, now stood tranquilly looking on the\r\nspectators, who filled the air with _vivas_ in praise of his prowess.\r\n\r\nThe trumpet again sounded the signal for the second part of the combat,\r\nand forthwith the _chulos_ advanced nimbly with their _banderillas_, each\r\nstriving to fix his weapon in the neck of the animal, as in their\r\nhazardous course he passed under their extended arms. The smart of the\r\n_banderillas_ tended to goad the bull to greater fury, and tormented on\r\nevery side he bellowed out in agony, and bounded from place to place,\r\nturning first to one, and then to another of his aggressors.\r\n\r\nThus, after he had vented his rage, foaming at the mouth and flashing fire\r\nfrom his eyes, the moment arrived when it was deemed expedient to put an\r\nend to his protracted sufferings, and at a given signal the _chulos_\r\nretired and made place for the _prima-espada_.\r\n\r\nThis was Candido, who though arrived at an advanced age, still retained\r\nmuch of the strength and agility of his youth, which, combined with the\r\nexperience he had acquired in the game, rendered him a very formidable\r\nopponent. He advanced with a stately pace, bearing in one hand a piece of\r\nscarlet cloth to entice the animal, and in the other his sword. Having\r\narrived in front of the seat of the presiding authorities, he made a\r\ngraceful salute, and then performed the same ceremony before his friends,\r\nwho hailed him with many hearty _vivas_; whilst a deadly silence was\r\nobserved on the part of the admirers of his rival Leoncito. Candido\r\nproceeded slowly, and warily towards the bull, endeavoring to entice him\r\nby waving the red cloth. The animal, however, would not suddenly rush\r\nagainst his foe; but calmly watched for the moment when he might find him\r\nless upon his guard.\r\n\r\nCandido, with all the skill of a practised _matador_, appeared to guess\r\nthe sinister intentions of the bull, and followed his every movement with\r\nan active eye—nay, he seemed to penetrate into the inmost feelings of the\r\nanimal.—Irritated by the defiance, the bull sprang upon his foe; but was\r\nbaffled in his vengeance, for he pierced only the floating piece of cloth;\r\nthe _matador_ very adroitly turning aside, and plunging his sword into his\r\nflank as he passed. The wound however was not mortal, and the combat was\r\nrenewed. The bull, somewhat intimidated, did not again charge his\r\nadversary; but preferred awaiting his approach;—after some appropriate\r\nevolutions, Candido at last boldly advanced towards him, and with a\r\nsuccessful thrust pierced him to the heart. Nothing had been wanting to\r\ncomplete the success of Candido but the solitary triumph of retaining his\r\nsword in his hand after the death-blow was inflicted, this being\r\nconsidered the _ne plus ultra_ of the art. The bull had no sooner fallen\r\nto the ground than a set of most beautiful mules, splendidly caparisoned,\r\nand ornamented with a profusion of ribbons and small flags, were brought\r\ninto the circus to convey from it the lifeless carcass. This operation was\r\nperformed amid the stormy sounds of martial music, and the shouts of the\r\nmultitude; the tremendous animal was dragged from the field, leaving in\r\nits progress a long crimson track upon the scattered sand.\r\n\r\nThe signal now sounded for a second fight; the doors were once more thrown\r\nopen, and a huge bull rushed forward, and without a moment’s loss ran\r\nfuriously at the nearest _picador_. He was, however, soon sobered, and\r\nsmarting with the pain of the first wound he received, prudently\r\nretreated, in no hurry to taste a like favor from the second cavalier. In\r\nvain did the _picadores_ provoke him by advancing into the arena, he\r\ninvariably declined the re-offered combat. The spectators, impatient at\r\nthis delay, grew expressively clamorous, some crying shame! shame! and\r\nothers _vaca! vaca!_ (poor cow! poor cow!)—but all these energetic\r\nremonstrances were lost upon the pacific animal.\r\n\r\nWith much difficulty, and after a pretty long interval, the three wounds\r\nof the _pica_ (according to rule) were at length inflicted; and the\r\n_chulos_ came forward to perform their part. It was here that the same\r\ndifficulty arose, for alas! it could not be expected that the poor bull,\r\nwho had shown no relish whatever for the _pica_, should evince any taste\r\nfor the _banderillas_. Consequently a great confusion arose, and a\r\nsimultaneous call for _banderillas de fuego_, was heard on every side.\r\nThis it was expected would prove a stimulus to the too tranquil\r\ntemperament of the animal.\r\n\r\nAccordingly the furs was planted upon his neck; but scarcely had the\r\nfireworks began to crack and whiz around his head, than stunned no doubt\r\nby the noise as well as the pain, he actually turned and fled. The\r\n_chulos_ ran after him, and thus continued _nolens volens_ to thrust their\r\nspears into his unresisting carcass, until it was thought expedient to\r\ndesist in order to give him the _coup de grace_. Leoncito the second\r\n_espada_ then came forward, and was hailed with joyful acclamations by his\r\npartisans, especially the _manolas_, for he was a young, light-made,\r\ndapper man. It proved however an exceedingly difficult task to kill the\r\nbull according to the rules of art, owing to the animal’s unequivocal\r\ndisinclination for the combat. Leoncito was a brave, daring man; but\r\nhardly so well skilled as Candido. He rushed boldly against the bull, and\r\nstrove to inflict upon him a mortal wound. He missed, however, his aim at\r\nthe right place, and the animal began to pour forth its blood in a stream.\r\nThis is considered an enormous fault in the art—and it met with a becoming\r\nstorm of groans and hisses. The bull, agonized by his wounds, ran wildly\r\nabout. Leoncito gave him another blow—when he sat down, and quietly looked\r\naround him, as the wounds were not immediately mortal. This reposing\r\nattitude gave immense annoyance both to the combatants and the spectators.\r\nOf course it was out of all question to inflict on so gentle and resigned\r\nan enemy another _estocada_—and yet the public could not afford to wait\r\nthe bull’s leisure to die, as it was necessary to continue the sport. To\r\nexpedite, therefore, the animal’s last moments, and the progress of public\r\nbusiness, the _eachetero_, a butcher, came forward and performed his\r\nfunction of inflicting the death-blow on occasions when, owing to the\r\nperversity of the bull or the clumsiness of the _matador_, his final\r\nassistance becomes requisite. Grasping firmly a short sharp dagger, he by\r\na steady and well directed blow put a period to the agonies of the\r\nanimal—applauses and abuse were then liberally bestowed upon Leoncito;\r\nafter which the fight was suffered to proceed, and the third bull sprang\r\ninto the arena. We will not, however, follow the perils and chances of\r\nthis encounter. It may e sufficient to mention, that the sport went on\r\nmuch upon the same principle as before. The usual number of horses were\r\nkilled, good spanking falls were endured by the combatants, and the same\r\ntumult and confusion prevailed throughout the circus. The combat had now\r\nlasted three hours, and the shadows of evening were gradually descending\r\nover the scene. Yet the spectators appeared by no means satisfied; some\r\neven grew clamorous, and required that a fourth bull should be brought\r\nforward. Amongst these unreasonable requisitionists, the _aficionado_\r\nparticularly distinguished himself. He was (unhappily for his neighbors)\r\nblessed with most stentorian lungs, of which he made a liberal use, upon\r\nthe most trifling occasion,—no other bull, however, was produced, and\r\naccordingly the spectators began slowly and discontentedly to disperse.\r\n\r\nThe fight being ended, the _picadores_ and the rest of the troop withdrew\r\nto the little chapel, to return thanks for their escape. However, the\r\nveracity expected from an historian compels me to say, that their evening\r\nprayers were by no means of the same length as those which had preceded\r\nthe encounter of the morning. At the entrance of the chapel we perceived\r\nmany a dark-complexioned _manola_—many a terrible looking,\r\nfierce-whiskered, cigar-smoking _majo_—awaiting the egress of their\r\nfriends; who, as soon as their devotions were concluded, stalked out with\r\na martial and haughty air to receive the congratulations of their\r\ncomrades. Meantime, the vast concourse of people so lately assembled\r\ntogether, had gradually dispersed through the various avenues of the\r\nPrado, affording the beholder a most striking and enlivening picture. The\r\nPrado itself, that beautiful promenade, which has attracted the attention\r\nof all who have visited Spain, now presented a most brilliant spectacle:\r\nit was crowded with carriages, as well as with pedestrians, all pressing\r\nto enjoy the coolness of the evening in that delightful spot. Having\r\nstrolled a few times up and down this fashionable promenade, we retired to\r\nthe _Neverria de Solos_, contiguous to the Prado, to take our _refresco_.\r\nTo this place, as to many others of the like nature, the more elegant\r\nclass of society retire early in the evening to eat ices, and drink\r\nlemonade and other refreshing beverages. From hence each person retires to\r\nhis own _tertulia_ for the evening, and thus ends a day wholly consecrated\r\nto pleasure.\r\n\r\nBull fights are now daily decreasing, both in number and splendor of\r\nappearance, from what they were in former times. Either the Spaniards are\r\nlosing their relish for such spectacles, or the scarcity of good\r\n_picadores_ and _espades_ detracts from the interest which attaches to\r\nthem. Not long since, the _matadores_ were favorites with the public, and\r\nwere regarded with considerable interest even by their superiors. Many\r\nsingular and gallant adventures are related of them and ladies of rank. It\r\nwas a common custom, no great while ago, to throw purses of gold to the\r\ncombatants, upon the achievement of some skilful feat. But unhappily the\r\nsecret of long purses is lost, and there is but little chance of a\r\nstranger seeing any money thrown away in Spain at the present time.\r\n\r\nThe most renowned of the Matadores were Romero and Pepe-Hillo, the author\r\nof a treatise entitled Tauromachia. The first retired from the arena full\r\nof honors and considerable wealth. But being desirous of obtaining for his\r\nson a canonship, he was commanded, in order to obtain that favor from the\r\nqueen, Maria Louisa, to re-appear in the arena, on some grand festival.\r\n\r\nRomero joyfully obeyed; but his age and feebleness were inadequate to cope\r\nwith the fearful bull, and he would certainly have been killed, had not\r\nhis friends forcibly withdrawn him from the arena.\r\n\r\nThe will, however, was taken for the deed, and his son was accordingly\r\nmade a canon. With regard to Pepe-Hillo, like a gallant general, he met\r\nhis death in the field of his exploits. On a certain occasion, contrary to\r\nthe opinion of his friends, who knew him to be suffering from a wound in\r\nthe hand, he appeared in the arena. Unhappily he had to encounter a\r\ntremendous animal. The bull hurled him on high twice; and when the\r\nunfortunate man fell on the ground he was frightfully gored, and shortly\r\nafterwards expired, amidst the most excruciating torments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LADY AND THE FLOWER.\r\n\r\n\r\nBY G. P. R. JAMES, ESQ.\r\n\r\n  There be of British arms and deeds,\r\n    Who sing in noble strain,\r\n  Of Poictiers’ field, and Agincourt,\r\n    And Cressy’s bloody plain.\r\n\r\n  High tales of merry

of a gallant knight,\r\n    A lady, and a flower.\r\n\r\n  The noble sun that shines on all,\r\n    The little or the great,\r\n  As bright on cottage doorway small,\r\n    As on the castle gate,\r\n\r\n  Came pouring over fair Guienne\r\n    From the far eastern sea;\r\n  And glistened on the broad Garonne,\r\n    And slept on Blancford lea.\r\n\r\n  The morn was up, the morn was bright,\r\n    In southern summer’s rays,\r\n  And Nature caroll’d in the light,\r\n    And sung her Maker’s praise.\r\n\r\n  Fair Blancford, thou art always fair,\r\n    With many a shady dell,\r\n  And bland variety and change,\r\n    Of forest and of fell.\r\n\r\n  But Blancford on that morn was gay,\r\n    With many a pennon bright,\r\n  And glittering arms and panoply\r\n    Shone in the morning light.\r\n\r\n  For good Prince Edward, England’s pride,\r\n    Now lay in Blancford’s towers,\r\n  And weary sickness had consumed,\r\n    The hero’s winter hours.\r\n\r\n  But now that brighter hopes had come,\r\n    With summer’s brighter ray,\r\n  He called his gallant knights around,\r\n    To spend a festal day.\r\n\r\n  With tournament and revelry,\r\n    To pass away the hours,\r\n  And win fair Mary from her sire,\r\n  The Lord of Blancford’s towers.\r\n\r\n  But why fair Mary’s brow was sad\r\n    None in the castle knew,\r\n  Nor why she watched one garden bed,\r\n  Where none but wild pinks grew.\r\n\r\n  Some said that seven nights before\r\n    A page had sped away,\r\n  To where Lord Clifford with his power,\r\n    On Touraine’s frontier lay.\r\n\r\n  To Blancford no Lord Clifford came,\r\n    And many a tale was told,\r\n  For well ’twas known that he had sought,\r\n    Fair Mary’s love of old.\r\n\r\n  And some there said Lord Clifford’s love\r\n    Had cooled at Mary’s pride,\r\n  And some there said that other vows\r\n    His heart inconstant tied.\r\n\r\n  Foul slander, ready still to soil,\r\n    All that is bright and fair,\r\n  With more than Time’s destructiveness,\r\n    Who never learned to spare.\r\n\r\n  The morn was bright, but posts had come,\r\n    Bringing no tidings fair,\r\n  For knit was Edward’s royal brow,\r\n    And full of thoughtful care.\r\n\r\n  The lists were set, the parted sun\r\n    Shone equal on the plain,\r\n  And many a knight there manfully\r\n    Strove fresh applause to gain.\r\n\r\n  Sir Henry Talbot, and Sir Guy\r\n    Of Brackenbury, he\r\n  Who slew the giant Iron-arm,\r\n    On Cressy’s famous lea,\r\n\r\n  Were counted best, and claimed the Prince\r\n    To give the sign that they\r\n  Might run the tilt, and one receive\r\n    The honors of the day.\r\n\r\n  \"Speed, knights, perhaps those arms that shine\r\n    In peace,\" prince Edward said,\r\n  \"Before a se’nnight pass, may well,\r\n    In Gallic blood be died.\r\n\r\n  \"For here we learn that hostile bands,\r\n    Have gathered in Touraine,\r\n  And Clifford, with his little troop,\r\n    Are prisoners or slain.\r\n\r\n  \"For with five hundred spears, how bold\r\n    Soe’er his courage show,\r\n  He never could withstand the shock,\r\n    Of such a host of foe.\"\r\n\r\n  Fair Mary spoke not, but the blood\r\n    Fled truant from her cheek,\r\n  And left it pale, as when day leaves\r\n    Some mountain’s snowy peak.\r\n\r\n  But then there camp the cry of horse,\r\n    The east lea pricking o’er,\r\n  And to the lists a weary page\r\n    A tattered pennon bore.\r\n\r\n  Fast came a knight with blood-stained arms,\r\n    And dusty panoply,\r\n  And beaver down, and armed lance,\r\n    In chivalric array.\r\n\r\n  No crest, no arms, no gay device,\r\n    Upon his shield he wore,\r\n  But a small knot beside his plume,\r\n    Of plain wild pinks he bore.\r\n\r\n  For love, for love and chivalry,\r\n    Lord Clifford rides the plain,\r\n  And foul he lies who dares to say,\r\n    His honor e’er know stain.\r\n\r\n  And Mary’s cheek ’gan blushing bright,\r\n    And Mary’s heart beat high,\r\n  And Mary’s breath that fear oppressed\r\n    Came in a long glad sigh.\r\n\r\n  Straight to the Prince the knight he rode,\r\n    \"I claim these lists,\" he cried,\r\n  \"Though late into the field I come,\r\n    My suit be not denied;\r\n\r\n  \"For we have fought beside the Loire,\r\n    And stained our arms in blood;\r\n  Not ever lost one step of ground,\r\n    So long as rebels stood.\r\n\r\n  \"Hemmed in, I one time never thought\r\n    To die in British land,\r\n  Or see my noble prince again,\r\n    Or kiss his royal hand.\r\n\r\n  \"But well fought every gallant squire,\r\n    And well fought every knight;\r\n  And rebels have been taught to feel\r\n    The force of British might.\r\n\r\n  \"And now in humble terms they sue,\r\n    To know thy high command,\r\n  And here stand I these lists to claim,\r\n    For a fair lady’s hand.\r\n\r\n  \"For Mary’s love, and chivalry,\r\n    I dare the world to fight,\r\n  And foul and bitterly he lies,\r\n    Who dares deny my right\"\r\n\r\n  \"No, no, brave Clifford,\" Edward said,\r\n    \"No lists to-day for thee,\r\n  Thy gallant deeds beside the Loire,\r\n    Well prove thy chivalry.\r\n\r\n  \"Sir Guy, Sir Henry, and the rest,\r\n    Have well acquit their arms,\r\n  But Edward’s thanks are Clifford’s due,\r\n    As well as Mary’s charms.\"\r\n\r\n  \"My lord, you are her sire,\" he said,\r\n    \"Give kind consent and free,\r\n  And who denies our Clifford’s right,\r\n    Shall ride a tilt with me.\"\r\n\r\n  Gay spake the prince, gay laughed the throng,\r\n    And Mary said not nay,\r\n  And bright with smile, and dance, and song,\r\n    Went down the festal day.\r\n\r\n  And when Lord Clifford to the board\r\n    Led down his Mary fair,\r\n  A knot of pinks was in his cap,\r\n    A knot was in her hair.\r\n\r\n  For it had been their sign of love,\r\n    And loved by them was still,\r\n  Till death came quietly on their heads,\r\n    And bowed them to his will.\r\n\r\n  And now, though years have passed away,\r\n    And all that years have seen,\r\n  And Clifford’s deeds and Mary’s charms,\r\n    Are as they ne’er had been,\r\n\r\n  Some wind, as if in memory\r\n    Has borne the seeds on high,\r\n  To deck the ruin’s crumbling wall,\r\n    And catch the passing eye.\r\n\r\n  It tells a tale to those who hear;\r\n    For beauty, strength, and power,\r\n  Are but the idols of a day,\r\n    More short-lived than a flower.\r\n\r\n  Joy on, joy on, then, while ye may,\r\n    Nor waste the moments dear;\r\n  Nor give yourself a cause to sigh,\r\n    Nor teach to shed a tear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAN OLD MAID’S FIRST LOVE.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    From Chamber’s Edinburgh Journal.\r\n\r\n\r\nI went once to the south of France for my health; and being recommended to\r\nchoose the neighborhood of Avignon, took my place, I scarcely know why, in\r\nthe diligence all the way from Paris. By this proceeding I missed the\r\nsteam-voyage down the Rhone, but fell in with some very pleasant people,\r\nabout whom I am going to speak. I travelled in the _intérieur_, and from\r\nLyon had no one for companion but a fussy little lady, of a certain age,\r\nwho had a large basket, a parrot in a cage, a little lapdog, a bandbox, a\r\nhuge blue umbrella, which she could never succeed in stowing any where,\r\nand a moth-eaten muff. In my valetudinarian state I was not pleased with\r\nthis inroad—especially as the little lady had a thin, pinched-up face, and\r\nobstinately looked out of the window, while she popped about the\r\n_intérieur_ as if she had just taken lodgings and was putting them in\r\norder, throwing me every now and then some gracious apology in a not\r\nunpleasant voice. \"Mince as you please, madam,\" thought I; \"you are a\r\nbore.\" I am sorry to add that I was very unaccommodating, gave no\r\nassistance in the stowing away of the umbrella, and when Fanfreluche came\r\nand placed his silken paws upon my knees, pushed him away very rudely. The\r\nlittle old maid—it was evident this was her quality—apologized for her dog\r\nas she had done for herself, and went on arranging her furniture—an\r\noperation not completed before we got to St. Saphorin.\r\n\r\nFor some hours a perfect silence was preserved, although my companion\r\nseveral times gave a short dry cough, as if about to make an observation.\r\nAt length, the digestion of a hurried dinner being probably completed, I\r\nfelt all of a sudden quite bland and sociable, and began to be mightily\r\nashamed of myself. \"Decidedly,\" thought I, \"I must give this poor woman\r\nthe benefit of my conversation.\" So I spoke, very likely with that\r\nself-satisfied air assumed sometimes by men accustomed to be well\r\nreceived. To my great vexation the old maid had by this time taken\r\noffence, and answered in a very stiff and reserved manner. Now the whole\r\nabsurdity of my conduct was evident to me, and I determined to make\r\namends. Being naturally of a diplomatic turn, I kept quiet for awhile, and\r\nthen began to make advances to Fanfreluche. The poor animal bore no\r\nmalice, and I won his heart by stroking his long ears. Then I gave a piece\r\nof sugar to the parrot; and having thus effected a practicable breach,\r\ntook the citadel by storm by pointing out a more commodious way of\r\narranging the great blue umbrella.\r\n\r\nWe were capital friends thenceforward; and I soon knew the history of\r\nMlle. Nathalie Bernard by heart. A mightily uninteresting history it was\r\nto all but herself; so I shall not repeat it: suffice to say, that she had\r\nlived long on her little income, as she called it, at Lyon, and was now on\r\nher way to Avignon, where a very important object called her. This was no\r\nother than to save her niece Marie from a distasteful marriage, which her\r\nparents, very good people, but dazzled by the wealth of the unamiable\r\nsuitor, wished to bring about.\r\n\r\n\"And have you,\" said I, \"any reasonable hope of succeeding in your\r\nmission?\"\r\n\r\n\"_Parbleu!_\" replied the old maid, \"I have composed a little speech on\r\nill-assorted unions, which I am sure will melt the hearts of my sister and\r\nmy brother-in-law; and if that does not succeed—why, I will make love to\r\nthe _futur_ myself, and whisper in his ear that a comfortable little\r\nincome available at once, and a willing old maid, are better than a\r\ncross-grained damsel with expectations only. You see I am resolved to make\r\nany sacrifice to effect my object.\"\r\n\r\nI laughed at the old maid’s disinterestedness, which was perhaps greater\r\nthan at first appeared. At least she assured me that she had refused\r\nseveral respectable offers, simply because she liked the independence of a\r\nsingle life; and that if she had remained single to that age, it was a\r\nsign that marriage had nothing attractive for her in itself. We discussed\r\nthe point learnedly as the diligence rolled; and what with the original\r\nturn of my companion’s mind, the sportive disposition of Fanfreluche, and\r\nthe occasional disjointed soliloquies of Coco, the parrot, our time passed\r\nvery pleasantly. When night came Mlle. Nathalie ensconced herself in the\r\ncorner behind her parcels and animals, and endeavored to sleep; but the\r\njolting of the diligence, and her own lively imagination, wakened her\r\nevery five minutes; and I had each time to give her a solemn assurance, on\r\nmy word of honor as a gentleman, that there was no particular danger of\r\nour being upset into the Rhone.\r\n\r\nWe were ascending a steep hill next day; both had got out to walk. I have\r\nomitted to note that it was autumn. Trees and fields were touched by the\r\ngolden fingers of the season. The prospect was wide, but I forget the\r\nprecise locality. On the opposite side of the Rhone, which rolled its\r\nrapid current in a deepening valley to our right, rose a range of hills,\r\ncovered with fields that sloped wonderfully, and sometimes gave place to\r\nprecipices or wood-lined declivities. Here and there the ruins of some old\r\ncastle—reminiscences of feudal times—rose amid lofty crags, and traced\r\ntheir jagged outline against the deep blue sky of Provence. Nathalie\r\nbecame almost sentimental as she gazed around on this beautiful scene.\r\n\r\nWe had climbed about half of the hill: the diligence was a little way\r\nbehind: the five horses were stamping and striking fire from the pavement\r\nas they struggled up with the ponderous vehicle: the other passengers had\r\nlingered in the rear with the conductor, who had pointed out a little\r\n_auberge_ among some trees. We here saw a man preceding us upon the road\r\ncarrying a little bundle at the end of a stick over his shoulder: he\r\nseemed to advance painfully. Our attention was attracted—I scarcely knew\r\nwhy. He paused a moment—then went on with an uncertain step—paused again,\r\nstaggered forward, and fell on his face just as we came up. Mlle.\r\nNathalie, with a presence of mind that surprised me, had her\r\nsmelling-bottle out in an instant, and was soon engaged in restoring the\r\nunfortunate traveller to consciousness. I assisted as well as I was able,\r\nand trust that my good-will may atone for my awkardness. Nathalie did\r\nevery thing; and, just as the diligence reached us, was gazing with\r\ndelight on the languid opening of a pair of as fine eyes as I have ever\r\nseen, and supporting in her lap a head covered with beautiful curls. Even\r\nat that moment, as I afterwards remembered, she looked upon the young man\r\nas a thing over which she had acquired a right of property. \"He is going\r\nour way,\" said she: \"let us lift him into the diligence.\"\r\n\r\n\"A beggarly Parisian; yo, yo!\" quoth the postilion as he passed, clacking\r\nhis long whip.\r\n\r\n\"Who will answer for his fare?\" inquired the conductor.\r\n\r\n\"I will,\" replied Nathalie, taking the words out of my mouth.\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes the young man, who looked bewildered and could not speak,\r\nwas safely stowed among Nathalie’s other parcels; and the crest of the\r\nhill being gained, we began rolling rapidly down a steep descent. The\r\nlittle old maid, though in a perfect ecstasy of delight—the incident\r\nevidently appeared to her quite an adventure—behaved with remarkable\r\nprudence. While I was puzzling my head to guess by what disease this poor\r\nyoung man had been attacked, she was getting ready the remedies that\r\nappeared to her the most appropriate, in the shape of some excellent cakes\r\nand a bottle of good wine, which she fished out of her huge basket. Her\r\n_protégé_, made tame by hunger, allowed himself to be treated like a\r\nchild. First she gave him a very small sip of Burgundy, then a diminutive\r\nfragment of cake; and then another sip and another piece of cake—insisting\r\non his eating very slowly. Being perfectly useless, I looked quietly on,\r\nand smiled to see the suhmissiveness with which this fine, handsome fellow\r\nallowed himself to be fed by the fussy old maid, and how he kept his eyes\r\nfixed upon her with an expression of wondering admiration.\r\n\r\nBefore we arrived at Avignon we knew the history of the young man. He was\r\nan artist, who had spent several years studying in Paris, without friends,\r\nwithout resources, except a miserable pittance which his mother, a poor\r\npeasant woman living in a village not far from Aix, had managed to send\r\nhim. At first he had been upheld by hope; and although he knew that his\r\nmother not only denied herself necessaries, but borrowed money to support\r\nhim, he was consoled by the idea that the time would come when, by the\r\nefforts of his genius, he would be able to repay every thing with the\r\naccumulated interest which affection alone would calculate. But his\r\nexpenses necessarily increased, and no receipts came to meet them. He was\r\ncompelled to apply to his mother for further assistance. The answer was\r\none word—\"impossible.\" Then he endeavored calmly to examine his position,\r\ncame to the conclusion that for several years more he must be a burden to\r\nhis mother if he obstinately pursued his career, and that she must be\r\nutterly ruined to insure his success. So he gave up his art, sold every\r\nthing he had to pay part of his debts, and set out on foot to return to\r\nbig village and become a peasant, as his father had been before him. The\r\nlittle money he had taken with him was gone by the time he reached Lyon.\r\nHe had passed through that city without stopping, and for more than two\r\ndays, almost for two nights, had incessantly pursued his journey, without\r\nrest and without food, until he had reached the spot where, exhausted with\r\nfatigue and hunger, he had fallen, perhaps to perish had we not been there\r\nto assist him.\r\n\r\nNathalie listened with eager attention to this narrative, told with a\r\nfrankness which our sympathy excited. Now and then she gave a convulsive\r\nstart, or checked a hysterical sob, and at last fairly burst into tears. I\r\nwas interested as well as she, but retained more calmness to observe how\r\nmoral beauty almost vainly straggled to appear through the insignificant\r\nfeatures of this admirable woman. Her little eyes, reddened with weeping;\r\nher pinched-up nose, blooming at the point; her thin lips, probably\r\naccustomed to sarcasm; her cheeks, with a leaded citron hue; her hair that\r\nforked up in unmanageable curls—all combined to obscure the exquisite\r\nexpression of respect and sympathy, perhaps already of love, sparkling\r\nfrom her kindled soul, that could just be made out by an attentive eye. At\r\nlength, however, she became for a moment perfectly beautiful, as, when the\r\nyoung painter had finished his story, with an expression that showed how\r\nbitterly he regretted his abandoned art, she took both his hands in hers,\r\nand exclaimed: \"No, _mon enfant_, you shall not be thus disappointed. Your\r\ngenius\"—she already took it for granted he had genius—\"shall have an\r\nopportunity for development. Your mother cannot do what is necessary—she\r\nhas played her part. I will be a—second mother to you, in return f«r the\r\nlittle affection you can bestow on me without ingratitude to her to whom\r\nyou owe your life.\"\r\n\r\n\"My life has to be paid for twice,\" said he, kissing her hand. Nathalie\r\ncould not help looking round proudly to me. It was so flattering to\r\nreceive the gallant attentions of so handsome a young man, that I think\r\nshe tried to forget how she had bought them.\r\n\r\nIn the exuberance of her hospitality, the little old maid invited both\r\nClaude Richer and myself to spend some time in the large farmhouse of her\r\nbrother-in-law. I declined, with a promise to be a frequent visitor; but\r\nClaude, who was rather commanded than asked, could do nothing but accept.\r\nI left them at the diligence office, and saw them walk away, the little\r\nNathalie affecting to support her feeble companion. For the honor of human\r\nnature let me add, that the conductor said nothing about the fare. \"It\r\nwould have been indelicate,\" he said to me, \"to remind Mlle. Nathalie of\r\nher promise in the young man’s presence. I know her well; and she will pay\r\nme at a future time. At any rate I must show that there is a heart under\r\nthis waistcoat.\" So saying, the conductor thumped his breast with simple\r\nadmiration of his own humanity, and went away, after recommending me to\r\nthe Café de Paris—indeed and excellent house.\r\n\r\nI shall say nothing of a variety of little incidents that occurred to me\r\nat Avignon, nor about my studies on the history of the popes who resided\r\nthere. I must reserve myself entirely for the development of Nathalie’s\r\nromance, which I could not follow step by step, but the chief features of\r\nwhich I was enabled to catch during a series of visits I paid to the\r\nfarmhouse. Nathalie herself was very communicative to me at first, and\r\nscarcely deigned to conceal her sentiments. By degrees, however, as the\r\ncatastrophe approached, she became more and more reserved; and I had to\r\nlearn from others, or to guess the part she played.\r\n\r\nThe farmhouse was situated on the other side of the river, in a small\r\nplain, fertile and well wooded. Old Cossu, the owner, was a fine jolly\r\nfellow, but evidently a little sharp in money matters. I was surprised at\r\nfirst that he received the visit of Claude favorably; but when it came out\r\nthat a good part of his capital belonged to Nathalie, every circumstance\r\nof deference to her was explained. Mère Cossu was not a very remarkable\r\npersonage; unless it be remarkable that she entertained the most profound\r\nveneration for her husband, quoted his commonest sayings as witticisms,\r\nand was ready to laugh herself into convulsions if he sneezed louder than\r\nusual. Marie was a charming little person; perhaps a little too demure in\r\nher manners, considering her wicked black eyes. She was soon very friendly\r\nwith Claude and me, but seemed to prefer passing her time in whispered\r\nconversations with Nathalie. I was let into the secret that their\r\nconversation turned principally on the means of getting rid of the\r\nhusband-elect—a great lubberly fellow, who lived some leagues off, and\r\nwhose red face shone over the garden-gate, in company with a huge nosegay,\r\nregularly every Sunday morning. In spite of the complying temper of old\r\nCossu in other respects when Nathalie gave her advice, he seemed\r\nobstinately bent on choosing his own son-in-law. Parents are oftener\r\ncorrect than romancers will allow, in their negative opinions on this\r\ndelicate subject, but I cannot say as much for them when they undertake to\r\nbe affirmative.\r\n\r\nI soon observed that Nathalie was not so entirely devoted to the\r\naccomplishment of the object for which she had undertaken her journey as\r\nshe had promised; and, above all, that she spoke no more of the\r\ndisinterested sacrifice of herself as a substitute for Marie. I\r\nmaliciously alluded to this subject in one of our private confabulations,\r\nand Nathalie, instead of being offended, frankly answered that she could\r\nnot make big Paul Boneau happy and assist Claude in his studies at the\r\nsame time. \"I have now,\" she said, \"an occupation for the rest of my\r\nlife—namely, to develop this genius, of which France will one day be\r\nproud; and I shall devote myself to it unremittingly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come, Nathalie,\" replied I, taking her arm in mine as we crossed the\r\npoplar-meadow, \"have you no hope of a reward?\"\r\n\r\n\"I understand,\" quoth she frankly; \"and I will not play at cross-purposes\r\nwith you. If this young man really loves his art, and his art alone, as he\r\npretends, could he do better than reward me—as you call it—for my\r\nassistance? The word has a cruel signification, but you did not mean it\r\nunkindly.\"\r\n\r\nI looked at her wan, sallow countenance, that had begun for some days to\r\nwear an expression of painful anxiety. At that moment I saw over a\r\nhedge—but she could not—Claude and Marie walking in a neighboring field,\r\nand pausing now and then to bend their heads very close together in\r\nadmiration of some very common flower. \"Poor old maid,\" thought I, \"you\r\nwill have no reward save the consciousness of your own pure intentions.\"\r\n\r\nThe minute development of this drama without dramatic scenes would perhaps\r\nbe more instructive than any elaborate analysis of human passions in\r\ngeneral; but it would require a volume, and I can only here give a mere\r\nsummary. Nathalie, in whom alone I felt particularly interested, soon\r\nfound that, she had deceived herself as to the nature of her sentiments\r\nfor Claude—that instead of regarding him with almost maternal solicitude,\r\nshe loved him with an intensity that is the peculiar characteristic of\r\npassions awakened late in life, when the common consolation is\r\ninadmissible—\"after all, I may find better.\" This was her last, her only\r\nchance of a happiness, which she had declared to me she had never dreamed\r\nof, but which in reality she had only declined because it did not present\r\nitself to her under all the conditions required by her refined and\r\nsensitive mind. Claude, who was an excellent fellow, but incapable of\r\ncomprehending her or sacrificing himself, never swerved from grateful\r\ndeference to her; but I could observe, that as the state of her feelings\r\nbecame more apparent, he took greater care to mark the character of his\r\nsentiments for her, and to insist with some affectation on the depth of\r\nhis filial affection. Nathalie’s eyes were often red with tears—a fact\r\nwhich Claude did not choose perhaps to notice, for fear of an explanation.\r\nMarie, on the contrary, became more blooming every day, while her eloquent\r\neyes were still more assiduously bent upon the ground. It was evident to\r\nme that she and Claude understood one another perfectly well.\r\n\r\nAt length the same thing became evident to Nathalie. How the revelation\r\nwas made to her I do not know; but sudden it must have been, for I met her\r\none day in the poplar-field, walking hurriedly along with an extraordinary\r\nexpression of despair in her countenance. I know not why, but the thought\r\nat once occurred to me that the Rhone ran rapid and deep not far off, and\r\nI threw myself across her path. She started like a guilty thing, but did\r\nnot resist when I took her hand and led her back slowly towards the\r\nfarmhouse. We had nearly reached it in silence when she suddenly stopped,\r\nand bursting into tears turned away into a by-lane where was a little\r\nbench under an elm. Here she sat down and sobbed for a long time, while I\r\nstood by. At length she raised her head and asked me: \"Do morality and\r\nreligion require self-sacrifice even to the end—even to making half a life\r\na desert, even to heart-breaking, even unto death?\"\r\n\r\n\"It scarcely belongs to a selfish mortal to counsel such virtue,\" I\r\nreplied; \"but it is because it is exercised here and there, now and then,\r\nonce in a hundred years, that man can claim some affinity with the divine\r\nnature.\"\r\n\r\nA smile of ineffable sweetness played about the poor old girl’s lips. She\r\nwiped her eyes, and began talking of the changing aspect of the season,\r\nand how the trees day by day more rapidly shed their leaves, and how the\r\nRhone had swelled within its ample bed, and of various topics apparently\r\nunconnected with her frame of mind, but all indicating that she felt the\r\nwinter was coming—a long and dreary winter for her. At this moment\r\nFanfreluche, which had missed her, came down the lane, barking with fierce\r\njoy; and she took the poor little beast in her arms, and exhaled the last\r\nbitter feeling that tormented her in these words: \"Thou at least lovest\r\nme—because I have fed thee!\" In her humility she seemed now to believe\r\nthat her only claim to love was her charity; and that even this claim was\r\nnot recognized except by a dog!\r\n\r\nI was not admitted to the secret of the family conclave that took place,\r\nbut learned simply that Nathalie pleaded with feverish energy the love\r\nthat had grown up between Marie and Claude as an insuperable bar to the\r\nproposed marriage between Paul Boneau and her niece. Matters were arranged\r\nby means of large sacrifices on the part of the heroic maid. Paul’s face\r\nceased to beam over the garden-gate on a Sunday morning; and by degrees\r\nthe news got abroad that Marie was betrothed to the young artist. One day\r\na decent old woman in _sabots_ came to the farmhouse: it was Claude’s\r\nmother, who had walked from Aix to see him. It was arranged that Claude\r\nshould pursue his studies a year longer, and then marry. Whether any\r\nexplanation took place I do not know; but I observed that the young man\r\nsometimes looked with the same expression of wondering admiration I had\r\nobserved in the diligence at the little Nathalie—more citron-hued than\r\never. At length she unhooked the cage of Coco, the parrot, took\r\nFaufreluche under one arm and her blue umbrella under the other, and went\r\naway in company with the whole family, myself included, every one carrying\r\na parcel or a basket to the diligence office. What a party that was! Every\r\none was in tears except Nathalie. She bore up manfully, if I may use the\r\nword; laughed, and actually joked; but just as I handed Coco in, her\r\nfactitious courage yielded, and she burst into an agony of grief. With\r\nofficious zeal I kept at the window until the diligence gave a lurch and\r\nstarted; and then turning round I looked at Claude and Marie, who were\r\nalready mingling their eyes in selfish forgetfulness of their\r\nbenefactress, and said solemnly: \"There goes the best woman ever created\r\nfor this unworthy earth.\" The artist, who, for an ordinary man, did not\r\nlack sentiment, took my hand and said: \"Sir, I will quarrel with any man\r\nwho says less of that angel than you have done.\"\r\n\r\nThe marriage was brought about in less time than had been agreed upon.\r\nNathalie of course did not come; but she sent some presents and a pleasant\r\nletter of congratulation, in which she called herself \"an inveterate old\r\nmaid.\" About a year afterwards I passed through Lyon and saw her. She was\r\nstill very yellow, and more than ever attentive to Fanfreluche and Coco. I\r\neven thought she devoted herself too much to the service of these two\r\ntroublesome pets, to say nothing of a huge cat which she had added to her\r\nmenagerie, as a kind of hieroglyphic of her condition. \"How fare the\r\nmarried couple?\" cried she, tossing up her cork-screw curls. \"Still cooing\r\nand billing?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mademoiselle,\" said I, \"they are getting on pretty well. Claude, finding\r\nthe historic pencil not lucrative, has taken to portrait-painting; and\r\nbeing no longer an enthusiastic artist, talks even of adopting the more\r\nexpeditious method of the Daguerreotype. In the meantime, half the\r\ntradesmen of Avignon, to say nothing of Aix, have bespoken caricatures of\r\nthemselves by his hand. Marie makes a tolerable wife, but has a terrible\r\nwill of her own, and is feared as well as loved.\"\r\n\r\nNathalie tried to laugh; but the memory of her old illusions coming over\r\nher, she leaned down towards the cat she was nursing, and sparkling tears\r\nfell upon its glossy fur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMADEMOISELLE DE CAMARGO.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom advance sheets of a capital book entitled \"Men and Women of the XIXth\r\n           Century, by Argene Houssaye,\" in press by Redfield.\r\n\r\n\r\nMademoiselle de Camargo almost came into the world dancing. It is related\r\nthat Gritry, when he was scarcely four years of age, had an idea of\r\nmusical tunes. Mademoiselle de Camargo danced at a much earlier age. She\r\nwas still in arms when the combined airs of a violin and a hautboy caught\r\nher ear. She jumped about full of life, and during the whole time that the\r\nmusic was playing, she danced, there is no other word for it, keeping time\r\nwith great delight. It must be stated that she was of Spanish origin. She\r\nwas born at Brussels, the 15th of April, 1710, of a noble family, that had\r\nsupplied several cardinals to the sacred college, and is of considerable\r\ndistinction in Spanish history, both ecclesiastical and national. Her name\r\nwas Marianne. Her mother had danced, but with the ladies of the court, for\r\nher own pleasure, and not for that of others. Her father, Ferdinand de\r\nCupis de Camargo, was a frank Spanish noble, that is to say he was poor;\r\nhe lived at Brussels, upon the crumbs of the table of the Prince de Ligne,\r\nwithout counting the debts he made. His family, which was quite numerous,\r\nwas brought up by the grace of God; the father frequented the tavern,\r\ntrusting to the truth that there is a God that rules over children!\r\n\r\nMarianne was so pretty that the Princess de Ligne used to call her her\r\nfairy daughter. Light as a bird, she used to spring into the elms, and\r\njump from branch to branch. No fawn in its morning gayety had more\r\ncapricious and easy movements; no deer wounded by the huntsman ever sprang\r\nwith more force and grace. When she was ten years old, the Princess de\r\nLigne thought that this pretty wonder belonged of right to Paris, the city\r\nof wonders, Paris, where the opera was then displaying its thousand and\r\nthousand enchantments. It was decided that Mademoiselle de Camargo should\r\nbe a dancing-girl at the opera. Her father objected strenuously:\r\n\"Dancing-girl! the daughter of a gentleman, a grandee of Spain!\"—\"Goddess\r\nof dance, if you please,\" said the Princess of Ligne, in order to quiet\r\nhim. He resigned himself to taking a journey to Paris in the prince’s\r\ncarriage. He arrived in the style of a lord at the house of Mademoiselle\r\nPrévost, whom the poets of the day celebrated under the name of\r\nTerpsichore. She consented to give lessons to Marianne de Camargo. Three\r\nmonths after his departure, M. de Camargo returned to Brussels, with the\r\nair of a conqueror. Mademoiselle de Prévost had predicted that his\r\ndaughter would be his glory and his fortune.\r\n\r\nAfter having danced at a fête given by the Prince de Ligne, Marianne de\r\nCamargo made her first appearance at the Brussels theatre, where she\r\nreigned for three years as first _danseuse_. Her true theatre was not\r\nthere; in spite of her triumph at Brussels, her imagination always carried\r\nher to Paris; notwithstanding when she quitted Brussels she went to Rouen.\r\nFinally, after a long residence in that city, she was permitted to make\r\nher first appearance at the opera. It was on the 5th of May, 1726, for the\r\nfamous day of her debût has not been forgotten, that she appeared with all\r\nthe brilliancy of sixteen upon the first stage in the world. Mademoiselle\r\nPrévost, already jealous, from a presentiment perhaps, had advised her to\r\nmake her first appearance in the _Characters of the Dance_, a step almost\r\nimpossible, which the most celebrated dancers hardly had dared to attemp,\r\nat the height even of their reputation. Mademoiselle de Camargo, who\r\ndanced like a fairy, surpassed all her predecessors; her triumph was so\r\nbrilliant that on the next day all the fashions took their name after her:\r\nhair _à la Camargo_, dresses _à la Camargo_, sleeves _à la Camargo_. All\r\nthe ladies of the court imitated her grace; there were not a few that\r\nwould have liked to have copied her face!\r\n\r\nI have not told all yet: Mademoiselle de Camargo was made by love and for\r\nlove. She was beautiful and pretty at the same time. There could be\r\nnothing so sweet and impassioned as her dark eyes, nothing so enchanting\r\nas her sweet smile! Lancret, Pater, J. B. Vanloo, all the painters that\r\nwere then celebrated, tried to portray her charming face.\r\n\r\nOn the second night of Mademoiselle de Camargo’s appearance on the stage,\r\nthere were twenty duels and quarrels without end at the door of the opera;\r\nevery one wanted to get in. Mademoiselle Prévost, alarmed at such a\r\ntriumph, intrigued with such success that Mademoiselle de Camargo was soon\r\nforced to fall back to the position of a mere _figurante_. She and her\r\nadmirers had reason to be indignant. She was obliged to resign herself to\r\ndancing unobserved with the company. But she was not long in avenging\r\nherself with effect. One day, while she was dancing with a group of\r\ndemons, Demoulins, called the devil, did not make his appearance to dance\r\nhis solo, when the musicians had struck up, expecting his entrance. A\r\nsudden inspiration seizes Mademoiselle de Camargo; she leaves the other\r\n_figurantes_, she springs forward to the middle of the stage, and\r\nimprovises Demoulins’s _pas de seul_, but with more effect and capricious\r\nvariety. Applause re-echoed throughout the theatre. Mademoiselle de\r\nPrévost swore that she would ruin her youthful rival; but it was too late.\r\nTerpsichore was dethroned. Mademoiselle de Camargo was crowned on that day\r\nqueen of the opera, absolute queen, whose power was unlimited! She was the\r\nfirst who dared to make the discovery that her petticoats were too long.\r\nHere I will let Grimm have his say: \"This useful invention, which puts the\r\namateur in the way of forming an intelligent judgment of the legs of a\r\ndancing-girl, was thought at that time to be the cause of a dangerous\r\nschism. The Jansenists of the pit exclaimed heresy, scandal; and were\r\nopposed to the shortened petticoats. The Molinists, on the contrary, held\r\nthat this innovation was in character with the spirit of the primitive\r\nchurch, which was opposed to the sight of pirouettes and pigeon-wings,\r\nembarrassed by the length of a petticoat. The Sorbonne of the opera had\r\nfor a long time great trouble in establishing the wholesome doctrine on\r\nthis point of discipline, which so much divided the faithful.\"\r\n\r\nMonsieur Ferdinand de Camargo grew old with a severe anxiety about the\r\nvirtue and the salary of his daughter: he only preserved the salary.\r\nIntoxicated with her triumph, Mademoiselle de Camargo listened too\r\nwillingly to all the lords of the court that frequented the company of the\r\nactresses behind the scenes; it would have been necessary for the king to\r\nappoint an historiographer, in order to record all the passions of this\r\n_danseuse_. There was a time when all the world was in love with her.\r\nEvery one swore by Camargo; every one sang of Camargo; every one dreamed\r\nabout Camargo. The madrigals of Voltaire and of the gallant poets of that\r\ngallant era are not forgotten.\r\n\r\nHowever, the glory of Mademoiselle de Camargo was extinguished by degrees.\r\nLike fashion that had patronized her, she passed away by degrees, never to\r\nreturn. When she insisted upon retiring, although she was only forty years\r\nof age, no one thought of preventing her: she was hardly regretted. There\r\nwas no inquiry made as to whither she had gone; she was only spoken of at\r\nrare intervals, and then she was only alluded to as a memory of the past.\r\nShe had become something of a devotee, and very charitable. She knew by\r\nname all the poor in her neighborhood. She occasionally was visited by\r\nsome of the notabilities of a past day, forgotten like herself.\r\n\r\nIn the _Amusements of the Heart and Mind_, a collection designed, as is\r\nwell known, to form the mind and the heart, Mademoiselle de Camargo is\r\ncharged with having had a thousand and more lovers! Without giving the lie\r\nto this accusation, can I not prove it false by relating, in all its\r\nsimplicity, a fact which proves a profound passion on her part? A pretty\r\nwoman may dance at the opera, smile upon numberless admirers, live\r\ncarelessly from day to day, in the noisy excitement of the world; still,\r\nthere will be some blessed hours, when the heart, though often laid waste,\r\nwill flourish again all of a sudden. Love is like the sky, which looks\r\nblue, even when reflected in the stream formed by the storm. It is thus\r\nthat love is occasionally found pure in a troubled heart. But, moreover,\r\nthis serious passion of Mademoiselle de Camargo was experienced by her in\r\nall the freshness of her youth.\r\n\r\nOne morning, Grimm, Pont-de-Veyle, Duclos, Helvetius, presented themselves\r\nin a gay mood, at the humble residence of the celebrated dancer. She was\r\nthen living in an old house in the Rue Saint-Thomas-du-Louvre. An aged\r\nserving-woman opened the door.—\"We wish to see Mademoiselle de Camargo,\"\r\nsaid Helvetius, who had great difficulty in keeping his countenance. The\r\nold woman led them into a parlor that was furnished with peculiar and\r\ngrotesque-looking furniture. The wainscoting was covered with pastels\r\nrepresenting Mademoiselle de Camargo in all her grace, and in her\r\ndifferent characters. But the parlor was not adorned by her portraits\r\nonly; there was a _Christ on_ _the Mount of Olives_, a _Magdalen at the\r\nTomb_, a _Veiled Virgin_, a _Venus_, the _Three Graces_, some _Cupids_,\r\nhalf concealed beneath some rosaries and sacred relics, and _Madonnas_,\r\ncovered with trophies from the opera!\r\n\r\nThe goddess of the place did not keep them a long time waiting; a door\r\nopened, half-a-dozen dogs of every variety of breed sprang into the\r\nparlor: it must be said, to the praise of Mademoiselle de Camargo, that\r\nthese were not lap-dogs. She appeared behind them, carrying in her arms\r\n(looking like a fur muff) an Angora cat of fine growth. As she had not\r\nfollowed the fashion for ten years or more, she appeared to have come from\r\nthe other world.—\"You see, gentlemen,\" pointing to her dogs, \"all the\r\ncourt I have at present, but in truth those courtiers there are well worth\r\nall others. Here, Marquis! down, Duke! lie down, Chevalier! Do not be\r\noffended, gentlemen, that I receive you in such company; but how was I to\r\nknow?...\"—Grimm first spoke.—\"You will excuse, mademoiselle, this\r\nunannounced visit when you know the important object of it.\"—\"I am as\r\ncurious as if I were only twenty years old,\" said Mademoiselle de Camargo;\r\n\"but, alas! when I was twenty, it was the heart that was curious; but now,\r\nin the winter of life, I am no longer troubled on that score.\"—\"The heart\r\nnever grows old,\" said Helvetius, bowing.—\"That is a heresy, sir: those\r\nonly dare to advance such maxims who have never been in love. It is love\r\nthat never grows old, for it dies in childhood. But the heart—\"—\"You see,\r\nmadame, that your heart is still young; what you have just said proves\r\nthat you are still full of fire and inspiration.\"—\"Yes, yes,\" said\r\nMademoiselle de Camargo, \"you are perhaps right; but when the hair is gray\r\nand the wrinkles are deep, the heart is a lost treasure; a coin that is no\r\nlonger current.\"—While saying this, she lifted up Marquis by his two paws,\r\nand kissed him on the head: Marquis was a fine setter-dog, with a\r\nbeautiful spotted skin.—\"They, at least, will love me to the last. But it\r\nseems to me we are talking nonsense; have we nothing better to talk about?\r\nCome, gentlemen, I am all attention!\"\r\n\r\nThe visitors looked at each other with some embarrassment; they seemed to\r\nbe asking of each other who was to speak first. Pont-de-Veyle collected\r\nhis thoughts, and spoke as follows: \"Mademoiselle, we have been\r\nbreakfasting together; we had a gay time of it, like men of spirit.\r\nInstead of bringing before us, as the Egyptians in olden times, mummies,\r\nin order to remind us that time is the most precious of all things, we\r\ncalled up all those gay phantoms which enchanted our youth: need I say\r\nthat you were not the least charming of them? who did not love you? who\r\ndid not desire to live with you one hour, even at the expense of a wound?\r\nHappiness never costs too much—\" Mademoiselle Camargo interrupted the\r\nspeaker: \"O gentlemen, do not, I beg, blind me with the memory of the\r\npast; do not awaken a buried passion! Let me die in peace! See, the tears\r\nare in my eyes!\"—The visitors, affected, looked with a certain degree of\r\nemotion at the poor old lady who had loved so much. \"It is strange,\" said\r\nHelvetius to his neighbor, \"we came here to laugh, but we are travelling\r\nquite another road; however, I must say, nothing could be more ludicrous\r\nthan such a caricature, if it were not of a woman.\" \"Proceed, sir,\" said\r\nMademoiselle de Camargo to Pont-de-Veyle. \"To tell you the truth, madame,\r\nthe worst fellow in the company, or rather he who had drank the most,\r\ndeclared that he was, of all your lovers, the one you most loved. ’The\r\nmere talk of a man who has had too much wine,’ said one of us. But our\r\nimpertinent emptied his glass, and backed his statement. The discussion\r\nbecame very lively. We talked, we drank, and we talked. When the last\r\nbottle was empty, and the dispute was likely to end in a duel, and we\r\ntalked without knowing, probably, what we said, the most sober of the\r\ncompany proposed to go and ask you yourself which of your lovers you loved\r\nthe most. Is it the Count de Melun? is it the Duke de Richelieu? is it the\r\nMarquis de Croismare? the Baron de Viomesnil? the Viscount de Jumilhac? is\r\nit Monsieur de Beaumont, or Monsieur d’Aubigny? is it a poet? is it a\r\nsoldier? is it an abbé?\" \"Pshaw! pshaw!\" said Mademoiselle de Camargo,\r\nsmiling; \"you had better refer to the _Court Calendar_!\" \"What we want to\r\nknow is not the names of those who have loved you, but, I repeat, the name\r\nof him whom you loved the most.\" \"You are fools,\" said Mademoiselle de\r\nCamargo, with an air of sadness and a voice that showed emotion; \"I will\r\nnot answer you. Let us leave our extinct passions in their tombs, in\r\npeace. Why unbury all those charming follies which have had their day?\"\r\n\"Come,\" says Grimm to Duclos, \"do not let us grow sentimental; that would\r\nbe too absurd. Mademoiselle de Camargo,\" said he, playing with the dogs at\r\nthe same time, \"which was the epoch of short petticoats? for that is one\r\nof the points of our philosophical dispute.\"\r\n\r\nThe aged _danseuse_ did not answer. Taking Pont-de-Veyle by the hand, all\r\nof a sudden, she said in rising: \"Monsieur, follow me.\" He obeyed with\r\nsome surprise. She conducted him to her bedchamber; it was like a basket\r\nof odds and ends; it looked like a linendraper’s shop in confusion; it was\r\nall disorder; it was quite evident that the dogs were at home there.\r\nMademoiselle de Camargo went to a little rosewood chest of drawers,\r\ncovered with specimens of Saxony porcelain, more or less chipped and\r\nbroken. She opened a little ebony box, exposing its contents to the eyes\r\nof Pont-de-Veyle. \"Do you see?\" said she, with a sigh. Pont-de-Veyle saw a\r\ntorn letter, the dry bouquet of half a century, the kind of flowers of\r\nwhich it was composed could hardly be recognized. \"Well?\" asked\r\nPont-de-Veyle. \"Well, do you understand?\" \"Not at all.\" \"Look at that\r\nportrait.\" She pointed with her finger to a wretched portrait in oils,\r\ncovered with dust and spider’s web. \"I begin to understand.\" \"Yes,\" said\r\nshe, \"that is his portrait. As for myself, I never look at it. The one\r\nhere,\" striking her breast, \"is more like. A portrait is a good thing for\r\nthose who have no time for memory.\"\r\n\r\nPont-de-Veyle looked in turn with much interest at the letter, the faded\r\nbouquet, and the wretched portrait. \"Have you ever met this person?\"\r\n\"Never.\" \"Let us return, then.\" \"No; I beg let me hear the story.\" \"Is it\r\nnot enough to have seen his portrait? You can now settle your dispute with\r\na word, since you know whether he whom I loved the most resembles your\r\nfriend who had taken so much wine.\" \"He does not resemble him the least in\r\nthe world.\" \"Well, that is all: I forgive your visit. Farewell! When you\r\nbreakfast with your friends, you can take up my defence somewhat. You can\r\ntell those libertines without pity, that I have saved myself by my heart,\r\nif we can be saved that way.... Yes, yes; it is my plank of safety, in the\r\nwreck!\"\r\n\r\nSaying these words, Mademoiselle de Camargo approached the door of the\r\nsaloon. Pont-de-Veyle followed her, carrying the ebony-box. \"Gentlemen,\"\r\nsaid he, to his merry friends, \"our drunken toper was a coxcomb; I have\r\nseen the portrait of the best beloved of the goddess of this mansion; now,\r\nyou must join your prayers to mine, to prevail upon Mademoiselle de\r\nCamargo to relate to us the romance of her heart; I only know the preface,\r\nwhich is melancholy and interesting; I have seen a letter, a bouquet, and\r\na portrait.\" \"I will not tell you a word,\" muttered she; \"women are\r\ncharged with not being able to keep a secret; there is, however, more than\r\none that they never tell. A love-secret is a rose which embalms our\r\nhearts; if it is told, the rose loses its perfume. I who address you,\"\r\nsaid Mademoiselle de Camargo, in brightening up, \"I have only kept my love\r\nin all its freshness by keeping it all to myself. There were only La\r\nCarton and that old rogue Fontenelle who ever got hold of my secret.\r\nFontenelle was in the habit of dining frequently with me; one day, finding\r\nme in tears, he was so surprised, he who never wept himself, from\r\nphilosophy, doubtless, that he tormented me for more than an hour for a\r\nsolution of the enigma. He was almost like a woman; he drew from me, by\r\nhis cat-like worrying, the history of my love. Would you believe it? I\r\nhoped to touch his heart, but it was like speaking to the deaf. After\r\nhaving listened to the end without saying a word, he muttered with his\r\nlittle weak voice, ’_It is pretty!_’ La Carton, however, wept with me. It\r\nis worth being a poet and a philosopher in order not to understand such\r\nhistories.\"\r\n\r\nMademoiselle de Camargo was silent; a deep silence followed, and every\r\nlook was upon her. \"Speak, speak! we are all attention,\" said Helvetius,\r\n\"we are more worthy of hearing your story than the old philosopher, who\r\nloved no one but himself.\" \"After all,\" she replied, carried away by the\r\ndelight of her remembrance, \"it will be spending a happy hour; I speak of\r\nmyself, and as for happy or unhappy hours, not many more are to pass\r\nduring my life, for I feel that I am passing away. But I do not know how\r\nto begin; a fire flashes before my eyes; I cannot see, I am so overcome.\r\nTo begin: I was twenty.... But I shall never have the courage to read my\r\nhistory aloud before so many people.\" \"Fancy, Mademoiselle de Camargo,\"\r\nsaid Helvetius, \"that you are reading a romance.\" \"Well, then,\" said she,\r\n\"I will begin without ceremony.\"\r\n\r\n\"I was twenty years old. You are all aware, for the adventure caused a\r\ngreat deal of scandal, you all know how the Count de Melun carried me off\r\none morning along with my sister Sophy. This little mad-cap, who had a\r\ngreat deal of imagination, having discovered me reading a letter of the\r\ncount’s, in which he spoke of his design, she swore upon her thirteen\r\nyears that he must carry her off too. I was far from conceding any such\r\nclaim. It was always taken for granted that children know nothing; but at\r\nthe opera, and in love, there are no children. The Count de Melun, by\r\nmeans of a bribe, had gained over the chambermaid. I was very culpable; I\r\nknew all, and had not informed my father. But my father wearied me\r\nsomewhat; he preached in the desert; that is to say he preached to me\r\nabout virtue. He was always talking to me about our noble descent, of our\r\ncousin, who was a cardinal, of our uncle, who was a grand inquisitor of\r\nthe Inquisition. Vanity of vanities! all was vanity with him, while with\r\nme all was love. I did not trouble myself about being of an illustrious\r\nfamily; I was handsome, I was worshipped, and, what was still better, I\r\nwas young.\r\n\r\n\"In the middle of the night I heard my door open; it was the Count de\r\nMelun. I was not asleep, I was expecting him. It is not every woman who\r\nwould like it that is run away with. I was going to be run away with.\r\n\r\n\"Love is not only charming in itself, it is so also from its romance. A\r\npassion without adventure is like a mistress without caprice. I was seated\r\nupon my bed. ’Is it you, Jacqueline?’ I said, affecting fright. ’It is I,’\r\nsaid the count, falling upon his knees. ’You, sir! Your letter was not a\r\njoke then?’ ’My horses are at hand; there is no time to lose; leave this\r\nsad prison: my hotel, my fortune, my heart, all are at your service.’ At\r\nthat moment a light appeared at the door. ’My father!’ I cried, with\r\naffright, as I concealed myself behind the bed curtains. ’All is lost,’\r\nmuttered the count. It was Sophy. I recognized her light step. She\r\napproached with the light in her hand, and in silence, toward the count.\r\n’My sister,’ said she, with some degree of excitement, but without losing\r\nher presence of mind, ’here I am, all ready.’ I did not understand; I\r\nlooked at her with surprise; she was all dressed, from head to foot. ’What\r\nare you saying? You are mad.’ ’Not by any means; I want to be run away\r\nwith, like yourself.’ The Count de Melun could not help laughing.\r\n’Mademoiselle,’ he said to her, ’you forget your dolls and toys. ’Sir,’\r\nreplied she, with dignity, ’I am thirteen years old. It was not yesterday\r\nthat I made my _début_ at the opera; I take a part on the stage in the\r\nravishment of Psyche.’ ’Good,’ says the count, ’we will carry you off\r\ntoo.’ ’It is as well,’ whispered the count in my ear; ’this is the only\r\nway of getting rid of her.’\r\n\r\n\"I was very much put out by this contretemps, which gave a new\r\ncomplication to our adventure. My father might forgive my being carried\r\noff, but Sophy! I tried to dissuade her from her mad enterprise. I offered\r\nher my ornaments; she would not listen to reason. She declared, that if\r\nshe was not carried off with me she would inform against us, and thus\r\nprevent the adventure. ’Do not oppose her.’ said the count; ’with such a\r\ntendency she will be sure to be carried off sooner or later.’—’Well, let\r\nus depart together,’ The chambermaid, who had approached with the\r\nstealthy, quiet step of a cat, told us to hurry, for she was afraid that\r\nthe noise of the horses, that were pawing the ground near by, would awaken\r\nMonsieur de Camargo. We were off; the carriage drove us to the count’s\r\nhotel, rue de la Culture-Saint-Gervais. Sophy laughed and sung. In the\r\nmorning I wrote to the manager of the opera, that by the advice of my\r\nphysician it was impossible for me to appear for three weeks. To tell you\r\nthe truth, gentlemen, in a week’s time I went myself to inform the manager\r\nthat I would dance that evening. This, you perceive, is not very\r\nflattering to the Count de Melun; but there are so few men in this world\r\nwho are sufficiently interesting for a week together. I loved the count,\r\ndoubtless, but I wanted to breathe a little without him. I desired the\r\nexcitement of the theatre. I opened my window, constantly, as if I would\r\nfly out of it.\r\n\r\n\"As soon as I appeared at the opera my father followed my track, and\r\ndiscovered the retreat of his daughters. One evening behind the scenes, he\r\nwent straight to the count and insulted him. The count answered him, with\r\ngreat deference, that he would avoid the chance of taking the life of a\r\ngallant gentleman who had given birth to such a daughter as I was. My\r\nfather did his best to prove and establish his sixteen quarterings, the\r\ncount was not willing to fight him. It was about that time that my father\r\npresented his famous petition to the Cardinal de Fleury: ’Your petitioner\r\nwould state to the Lord Cardinal, that the Count de Melun, having carried\r\noff his two daughters in the night, between the 10th and 11th of the month\r\nof May, 1728, holds them imprisoned in his hotel, rue de la\r\nCulture-Saint-Gervais. Your petitioner having to do with a person of rank,\r\nis obliged to have recourse to his majesty’s ministers; he hopes, through\r\nthe goodness of the king, justice will be done him, and that the Count de\r\nMelun will be commanded to espouse the elder daughter of your petitioner,\r\nand endow the younger.’\r\n\r\n\"A father could not have done better. The Cardinal de Fleury amused\r\nhimself a good deal with the petition, and recommended me, one day that we\r\nwere supping together, for full penance, to make over to my father my\r\nsalary at the opera. But I find I am not getting on with my story. But\r\nwhat would you have? The beginning is always where we dwell with the\r\ngreatest pleasure. I had been living in the count’s hotel a year; Sophy\r\nhad returned to my father’s house, where she did not remain long; but it\r\nis not her history that I am relating. One morning a cousin of the count\r\narrived at the hotel in a great bustle; he was about spending a season in\r\nParis, in all the wildness of youth. He took us by surprise at breakfast;\r\nhe took his seat at table, without ceremony, on the invitation of the\r\ncount.\r\n\r\n\"In the beginning he did not strike my fancy; I thought him somewhat of a\r\nbraggadocio. He cultivated his mustachios with, great care (the finest\r\nmustachios in the world), and spoke quite often enough of his prowess in\r\nbattle. Some visitor interrupting us, the count went into his library, and\r\nleft us together, _tête-à-tête_. Monsieur de Marteille’s voice, until then\r\nproud and haughty in its tone, softened a little. He had at first looked\r\nat me with the eye of a soldier; he now looked at me with the eye of a\r\npupil.—’Excuse, madame,’ said he, with some emotion, ’my rude soldier-like\r\nbearing; I know nothing of fine manners; I have never passed through the\r\nschool of gallantry. Do not be offended at any thing I may say.’—’Why,\r\nsir,’ said I, smiling, ’you do not say any thing at all.’—’Ah, if I knew\r\nhow to speak! but, in truth, I would feel more at home before a whole army\r\nthan I do before your beautiful eyes. The count is very happy in having\r\nsuch a beautiful enemy to contend with.’—While speaking thus, he looked at\r\nme with a supplicating tenderness which contrasted singularly with his\r\nlook of the hero. I do not know what my eyes answered him. The count then\r\ncame in, and the conversation took another turn.\r\n\r\n\"Monsieur de Marteille accepted the earnest invitation of his cousin to\r\nstay at his hotel. He went out; I did not see him again till evening. He\r\ndid not know who I was; the count called me Marianne, and,\r\nunintentionally, perhaps, he had not spoken a word to his cousin about the\r\nopera, or my grace and skill as a dancer. At supper, Monsieur de Marteille\r\nhad no longer the same frank gayety of the morning; a slight uneasiness\r\npassed like a cloud over his brow; more than once I caught his melancholy\r\nglance.—’Cheer up your cousin,’ I said to the count.—’I know what he\r\nwants,’ answered Monsieur de Melun; ’I will take him to-morrow to the\r\nopera. You will see that in that God-forsaken place he will find his\r\ngood-humor again.’—I felt jealous, without asking myself why.\r\n\r\n\"Next day the _Triumph of Bacchus_ was played. I appeared as Ariadne, all\r\ncovered with vine-leaves and flowers. I never danced so badly. I had\r\nrecognized Monsieur de Marteille among the gentlemen of the court. He\r\nlooked at me with a serious air. I had hoped to have had an opportunity to\r\nspeak with him before the end of the ballet, but he had already gone. I\r\nwas offended at his abrupt departure.—’How!’ said I to myself, ’he sees me\r\ndance, and this is the way he makes me his compliments.’—Next morning, he\r\nbreakfasted with us; he did not say a word about the evening; finally, not\r\nbeing able to resist my impatience, ’Well, Monsieur de Marteille,’ said I\r\nto him, somewhat harshly, ’you left early last night; it was hardly polite\r\nof you.’—’Ah! when you were to dance no more!’ said he, with a sigh. This\r\nwas the first time that I was ever spoken to thus. Fearing that he had\r\nsaid too much, and in order to divert Monsieur de Melun, who observed him\r\nwith a look of surprise, he began to speak of a little singer of no great\r\nmoment, who had a voice of some freshness.\r\n\r\n\"In the afternoon, the count detained at home for some reason or other,\r\nbegged his cousin to accompany me in a ride to the woods. He was to join\r\nus on horseback. The idea of this ride made my heart beat violently. It\r\nwas the first time that I had listened with pleasure to the beatings of my\r\nheart.\r\n\r\n\"We started on a fine summer’s day. Every thing was like a holyday: the\r\nsky, the houses, the trees, the horses, and the people. A veil had fallen\r\nfrom my eyes. For some minutes we remained in the deepest silence; not\r\nknowing what to do, I amused myself by making a diamond that I wore\r\nglisten in the rays of the sun that entered the carriage. Monsieur de\r\nMarteille caught hold of my hand. We both said not a word the whole time.\r\nI tried to disengage my hand; he held it the harder. I blushed; he turned\r\npale. A jolt of the carriage occurred very opportunely to relieve us from\r\nour embarrassment; the jolt had lifted me from my seat; it made me fall\r\nupon his bosom.—’Monsieur,’ said I, starting. ’Ah, madame, if you knew how\r\nI love you!’—He said this with a tenderness beyond expression; it was love\r\nitself that spoke! I had no longer the strength to get angry. He took my\r\nhand again and devoured it with kisses. He did not say another word; I\r\ntried to speak, but did not know what to say myself. From time to time our\r\nlooks met each other; it was then that we were eloquent. Such eternal\r\npledges, such promises of happiness!\r\n\r\n\"Notwithstanding, we arrived at the woods. All of a sudden, as if seized\r\nwith a new idea, he put his head out of the window, and said something to\r\nthe coachman. I understood, by the answer of La Violette, the coachman,\r\nthat he was not willing to obey; but Monsieur de Marteille having alluded\r\nto a caning and fifty pistoles, the coachman made no further objections. I\r\ndid not understand very well what he was about. After an hour’s rapid\r\ntravelling, as I was looking with some anxiety as to where we were, he\r\ntried to divert me by telling me some episodes of his life. Although I did\r\nnot listen very intelligently to what he said, I heard enough to find out\r\nthat I was the first woman he had ever loved. They all say so, but he told\r\nthe truth, for he spoke with his eyes and his heart. I soon found out that\r\nwe were no longer on our right road; but observe how far the feebleness of\r\na woman in love will go: I hadn’t the courage to ask him why he had\r\nchanged our route. We crossed the Seine in a boat, between Sèvres and St.\r\nCloud; we regained the woods, and after an hour’s ride through them, we\r\nreached an iron park-gate, at the extremity of the village of Velaisy.\r\n\r\n\"Monsieur de Marteille had counted without his host. He expected not to\r\nhave found a soul in his brother’s chateau, but, since the evening before,\r\nhis brother had returned from a journey to the coast of France. Seeing\r\nthat the chateau was inhabited, Monsieur de Marteille begged me to wait a\r\nlittle in the carriage. As soon as he had gone, the coachman came to the\r\ndoor.—’Well, madame, we breathe at last! my opinion is that we should make\r\nour escape. Depend upon the word of La Violette, we shall be in less than\r\ntwo hours at the hotel.’—’La Violette,’ said I, ’open the door.’—I ran a\r\ngreat risk. La Violette obeyed.—’Now,’ said I to him, when I had alighted\r\nupon the ground, ’you may go!’—He looked at me with the eye of an old\r\nphilosopher, mounted his box, and snapped his whip; but he had hardly\r\nstarted, when he thought it better to return.—’I will not return without\r\nmadame, for if I return alone, I shall be sure of a good heating, and of\r\nbeing discharged.’—’Indeed, La Violette! as you please.’ At that moment I\r\nsaw the count returning.—’It is all for the best,’ he cried out, in the\r\ndistance; ’my brother has only two days to spend in Paris: he has stopped\r\nhere to give his orders; he wishes, at all hazards, to see Camargo dance!\r\nI told him that she was to appear this evening. He will leave in a moment.\r\nYou must wait in the park till he is gone. I will return to him, for I\r\nmust take my leave of him, and wish him a pleasant journey.\r\n\r\n\"An hour afterward we were installed in the chateau. La Violette remained,\r\nat our order, with his carriage and horses. In the evening there was great\r\nexcitement at the opera. It was solemnly announced to the public that\r\nMademoiselle de Camargo had been carried off! The Count de Melun surprised\r\nat not finding us in the woods, had gone to the theatre. He was hissed; he\r\nswore revenge. He sought every where; he found neither his horses, nor his\r\ncarriage, nor his mistress. For three months the opera was in mourning!\r\nThirty bailiffs were on my track; but we made so little noise in our\r\nlittle chateau, hid away in the woods, that we were never discovered.\"\r\n\r\nMademoiselle de Camargo became pale; she was silent, and looked at her\r\nlisteners as if she would say by her looks that had been lighted up at\r\nthat celestial flame which had passed over her life: \"Oh, how we loved\r\neach other during those three months!\"\r\n\r\nShe continued as follows: \"That season has filled a greater space in my\r\nlife than all the rest of my days. When I think of the past, it is there\r\nwhere my thoughts travel at once. How relate to you the particulars of our\r\nhappiness? When destiny protects us, happiness is composed of a thousand\r\ncharming nothings that the hearts of others cannot understand. During\r\nthose three months I was entirely happy; I wished to live for ever in this\r\ncharming retreat for him that I loved a thousand times more than myself. I\r\nwished to abandon the opera, that opera that the Count de Melun could not\r\nmake me forget for a week!\r\n\r\n\"Monsieur de Marteille possessed all the attraction of a real passion; he\r\nloved me with a charming simplicity; he put in play, without designing it,\r\nall the seductions of love. What tender words! what impassioned looks!\r\nwhat enticing conversation! Each day was a holyday, each hour a rapture. I\r\nhad no time to think of the morrow.\r\n\r\n\"Our days were spent in walks, in the shade of the woods, in the thousand\r\nwindings of the park. In the evening I played the harpsichord, and I sang.\r\nIt often occurred that I danced, danced for him. In the middle of a dance\r\nthat would have excited a furor at the opera, I fell at his feet,\r\ncompletely overcome; he raised me up, pressed me to his heart and forgave\r\nme for having danced. I always hear his beautiful voice, which was like\r\nmusic, but such music as I dream of, and not such as Rameau has\r\ncomposed... But now I am speaking without knowing what I say.\"\r\n\r\nMademoiselle de Camargo turned toward Pont-de-Veyle. \"Monsieur,\" said she,\r\n\"open that box or rather hand it to me.\" She took the box, opened it, and\r\ntook the bouquet from it. \"But above all, gentlemen, I must explain to you\r\nwhy I have preserved this bouquet.\" While saying this she attempted to\r\nsmell the vanished odor of the bouquet.\r\n\r\n\"One morning,\" she resumed, \"Monsieur de Marteille awoke me\r\nearly—’Farewell!’ he said, pale and trembling.—’What are you saying?’\r\ncried I with affright.—’Alas,’ replied he, embracing me, I did not wish to\r\ntell you before, but for a fortnight I have had orders to leave.\r\nHostilities are to be resumed in the Low Countries; I have no longer a\r\nsingle hour either for you or for me; I have over forty leagues to travel\r\nto-day.’—’Oh, my God, what will become of me?’ said I weeping. ’I will\r\nfollow you.’—’But, my dear Marianne, I shall return.’—’You will return in\r\nan age! Go, cruel one, I shall be dead when you return.’\r\n\r\n\"An hour was spent in taking leave and in tears; he was obliged to go; he\r\nwent.\r\n\r\n\"I returned to weep in that retreat, that was so delightful the evening\r\nbefore. Two days after his departure, he wrote me a very tender letter, in\r\nwhich he told me that on the next day, he would have the consolation of\r\nengaging in battle. ’I hope,’ added he, ’that the campaign will not be a\r\nlong one; some days of hard fighting, and then I return to your feet.’\r\nWhat more shall I tell you? He wrote me once again.\"\r\n\r\nMademoiselle de Camargo unfolded slowly the torn letter. \"Here is the\r\nsecond letter:—\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                               Oct 17.\r\n\r\n    \"’No, I shall not return, my dear, I am going to die, but without\r\n    fear, without reproach. Oh! if you were here, Marianne! What\r\n    madness! in a hospital where, all of us, all, be we what we may,\r\n    are disfigured with wounds, and dying! What an idea to dash ahead\r\n    in the fight, when I only thought of seeing you again. As soon as\r\n    I was wounded, I asked the surgeon if I should live long enough to\r\n    reach Paris: \"You have but an hour,\" he answered me pitilessly...\r\n    They brought me here with the others. In a word, we should learn\r\n    to resign ourselves to what comes from Heaven. I die content with\r\n    having loved you; console yourself; return to the opera. I am not\r\n    jealous of those who shall succeed me, for will they love you as I\r\n    have done? Farewell, Marianne, death approaches, and death never\r\n    waits; I thank it for having left me sufficient time to bid you\r\n    farewell. Now, it will be I who will wait for you.\r\n\r\n    \"’Farewell, farewell, I press you to my heart, which ceases to\r\n    beat.’\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter having wiped her eyes, Mademoiselle de Camargo continued as follows:\r\n\"Shall I describe to you all my sorrows, all my tears, all my anguish!\r\nAlas! as he had said, I returned to the opera. I did not forget Monsieur\r\nde Marteille, in the tempest of my folly. Others have loved me. I have\r\nloved no one but Monsieur de Marteille; his memory has beamed upon my life\r\nlike a blessing from heaven. When I reappeared at the opera, I was seen\r\nattending mass; I was laughed at for my devotion. They did not understand,\r\nphilosophers as they were, that I prayed to God, in consequence of those\r\nwords of Monsieur de Martielle: ’Now it will be I who will wait for you.’\r\n\r\n\"When I left the chateau, I plucked a bouquet in the park, thinking that I\r\nwas plucking the flowers that had bloomed for him; I brought away this\r\nbouquet, along with the portrait that you see there. I had vowed, in\r\nleaving our dear retreat, to go every year, at the same season, to gather\r\na bouquet in the park. Will you believe it? I never went there again!\"\r\n\r\nMademoiselle de Camargo thus finished her history. \"Well, my dear\r\nphilosopher,\" said Helvetius to Duclos, in descending the steps, \"you have\r\njust read a book that is somewhat curious.\"—\"A bad book,\" answered Duclos,\r\n\"but such books are always interesting.\"\r\n\r\nIn April, 1770, the news spread that Mademoiselle de Camargo had just died\r\na good catholic. \"This created a great surprise,\" says a journal of the\r\nday, \"in the republic of letters, for she was supposed to have been dead\r\ntwenty years.\" Her last admirer and her last friend, to whom she had\r\nbequeathed her dogs and her cats, had caused her body to be interred with\r\na magnificence unexampled at the opera. \"All the world,\" says Grimm,\r\n\"admired that white pall, the symbol of chastity, that all unmarried\r\npersons are entitled to in their funeral ceremony.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMY NOVEL:\r\n\r\n\r\n                    OR, VARIETIES IN ENGLISH LIFE.(7)\r\n\r\n\r\nBY PISISTRATUS CAXTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK IX.—INITIAL CHAPTER.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow that I am fairly in the heart of my story, these preliminary chapters\r\nmust shrink into comparatively small dimensions, and not encroach upon the\r\nspace required by the various personages whose acquaintance I have picked\r\nup here and there, and who are now all crowding upon me like poor\r\nrelations to whom one has unadvisedly given a general invitation, and who\r\ndescend upon one simultaneously about Christmas time. Where they are to be\r\nstowed, and what is to become of them all, heaven knows; in the meanwhile,\r\nthe reader will have already observed that the Caxton family themselves\r\nare turned out of their own rooms, sent a-packing, in order to make way\r\nfor the new comers.\r\n\r\nAnd now that I refer to that respected family, I shall take occasion\r\n(dropping all metaphor) to intimate a doubt, whether, should these papers\r\nbe collected and republished, I shall not wholly recast the Initial\r\nChapters in which the Caxtons have been permitted to reappear. They assure\r\nme, themselves, that they feel a bashful apprehension lest they may be\r\naccused of having thrust irrelevant noses into affairs which by no means\r\nbelong to them—an impertinence which, being a peculiarly shy race, they\r\nhave carefully shunned in the previous course of their innocent and\r\nsegregated existence. Indeed, there is some cause for that alarm, seeing\r\nthat not long since, in a journal professing to be critical, this _My\r\nNovel, or Varieties in English Life_, was misnomed and insulted as \"a\r\nContinuation of _The Caxtons_,\" with which biographical work it has no\r\nmore to do (save in the aforesaid introductions to previous Books in the\r\npresent diversified and compendious narrative) than I with Hecuba, or\r\nHecuba with me. Reserving the doubt herein suggested for maturer\r\ndeliberation, I proceed with my new Initial Chapter. And I shall stint the\r\nmatter therein contained to a brief comment upon PUBLIC LIFE.\r\n\r\nWere you ever in public life, my dear reader? I don’t mean by that\r\nquestion, to ask whether you were ever Lord Chancellor, Prime Minister,\r\nLeader of the Opposition, or even a member of the House of Commons. An\r\nauthor hopes to find readers far beyond that very egregious but very\r\nlimited segment of the Great Circle. Were you ever a busy man in your\r\nvestry, active in a municipal corporation, one of a committee for\r\nfurthering the interests of an enlightened candidate for your native\r\nburgh, town, or shire?—in a word, did you ever resign your private\r\ncomforts as men in order to share the public troubles of mankind? If ever\r\nyou have so far departed from the Lucretian philosophy, just look back—was\r\nit life at all that you lived?—were you an individual distinct existence—a\r\npassenger in the railway?—or were you merely an indistinct portion of that\r\ncommon flame which heated the boiler and generated the steam that set off\r\nthe monster train?—very hot, very active, very useful, no doubt; but all\r\nyour identity fused in flame, and all your forces vanishing in gas.\r\n\r\nAnd you think the people in the railway carriages care for you?—do you\r\nthink that the gentleman in the worsted wrapper is saying to his neighbor\r\nwith the striped rug on his comfortable knees, \"How grateful we ought to\r\nbe for that fiery particle which is crackling and hissing under the\r\nboiler! It helps us on the fraction of an inch from Vauxhall to Putney?\"\r\nNot a bit of it. Ten to one but he is saying—\"Not sixteen miles an hour!\r\nWhat the deuce is the matter with the stoker?\"\r\n\r\nLook at our friend Audley Egerton. You have just had a glimpse of the real\r\nbeing that struggles under the huge copper;—you have heard the hollow\r\nsound of the rich man’s coffers under the tap of Baron Levy’s friendly\r\nknuckle—heard the strong man’s heart give out its dull warning sound to\r\nthe scientific ear of Dr. F vanishes the separate existence, lost again in\r\nthe flame that heats the boiler, and the smoke that curls into air from\r\nthe grimy furnace.\r\n\r\nLook to it, O Public Man, whoever thou art, and whatsoever thy degree—see\r\nif thou canst not compound matters, so as to keep a little nook apart for\r\nthy private life; that is, for _thyself_! Let the great Popkins Question\r\nnot absorb wholly the individual soul of thee, as Smith or Johnson. Don’t\r\nso entirely consume thyself under that insatiable boiler, that when thy\r\npoor little monad rushes out from the sooty furnace, and arrives at the\r\nstars, thou mayest find no vocation for thee there, and feel as if thou\r\nhadst nothing to do amidst the still splendors of the Infinite. I don’t\r\ndeny to thee the uses of \"Public Life;\" I grant that it is much to have\r\nhelped to carry that great Popkins Question; but Private Life, my friend,\r\nis the life of thy Private soul; and there may be matters concerned with\r\nthat which, on consideration, thou mayest allow, cannot be wholly mixed up\r\nwith the great Popkins Question—and were not finally settled when thou\r\ndidst exclaim—\"I have not lived in vain—the Popkins Question is carried at\r\nlast!\" O immortal soul, for one quarter of an hour _per diem_—de-Popkinise\r\nthine immortality!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt had not been without much persuasion on the part of Jackeymo, that\r\nRiccabocca had consented to settle himself in the house which Randal had\r\nrecommended to him. Not that the exile conceived any suspicion of the\r\nyoung man beyond that which he might have shared with Jackeymo, viz., that\r\nRandal’s interest in the father was increased by a very natural and\r\nexcusable admiration of the daughter. But the Italian had the pride common\r\nto misfortune,—he did not like to be indebted to others, and he shrank\r\nfrom the pity of those to whom it was known that he had held a higher\r\nstation in his own land. These scruples gave way to the strength of his\r\naffection for his daughter and his dread of his foe. Good men, however\r\nable and brave, who have suffered from the wicked, are apt to form\r\nexaggerated notions of the power that has prevailed against them. Jackeymo\r\nhad conceived a superstitious terror of Peschiera, and Riccabocca, though\r\nby no means addicted to superstition, still had a certain creep of the\r\nflesh whenever he thought of his foe.\r\n\r\nBut Riccabocca—than whom no man was more physically brave, and no man, in\r\nsome respects, more morally timid—feared the Count less as a foe than as a\r\ngallant. He remembered his kinsman’s surpassing beauty—the power he had\r\nobtained over women. He knew him versed in every art that corrupts, and\r\nvoid of all the conscience that deters. And Riccabocca had unhappily\r\nnursed himself into so poor an estimate of the female character, that even\r\nthe pure and lofty nature of Violante did not seem to him a sufficient\r\nsafeguard against the craft and determination of a practised and\r\nremorseless intriguer. But of all the precautions he could take, none\r\nappeared more likely to conduce to safety, than his establishing a\r\nfriendly communication with one who professed to be able to get at all the\r\nCount’s plans and movements, and who could apprise Riccabocca at once\r\nshould his retreat be discovered. \"Forewarned is forearmed,\" said he to\r\nhimself, in one of the proverbs common to all nations. However, as with\r\nhis usual sagacity he came to reflect upon the alarming intelligence\r\nconveyed to him by Randal, viz., that the Count sought his daughter’s\r\nhand, he divined that there was some strong personal interest under such\r\nambition; and what could be that interest save the probability of\r\nRiccabocca’s ultimate admission to the Imperial grace, and the Count’s\r\ndesire to assure himself of the heritage to an estate that he might be\r\npermitted to retain no more? Riccabocca was not indeed aware of the\r\ncondition (not according to usual customs in Austria) on which the Count\r\nheld the forfeited domains. He knew not that they had been granted merely\r\non pleasure; but he was too well aware of Peschiera’s nature to suppose\r\nthat he would woo a bride without a dower, or be moved by remorse in any\r\noverture of reconciliation. He felt assured, too—and this increased all\r\nhis fears—that Peschiera would never venture to seek an interview himself;\r\nall the Count’s designs on Violante would be dark, secret, and\r\nclandestine. He was perplexed and tormented by the doubt, whether or not\r\nto express openly to Violante his apprehensions of the nature of the\r\ndanger to be apprehended. He had told her vaguely that it was for her sake\r\nthat he desired secrecy and concealment. But that might mean any thing:\r\nwhat danger to himself would not menace her? Yet to say more was so\r\ncontrary to a man of his Italian notions and Machiavellian maxims! To say\r\nto a young girl, \"There is a man come over to England on purpose to woo\r\nand win you. For heaven’s sake take care of him; he is diabolically\r\nhandsome; he never fails where he sets his heart.\" \"Cospetto!\" cried the\r\ndoctor aloud, as these admonitions shaped themselves to speech in the\r\ncamera-obscura of his brain; \"such a warning would have undone a Cornelia\r\nwhile she was yet an innocent spinster.\" No, he resolved to say nothing to\r\nViolante of the Count’s intention, only to keep guard, and make himself\r\nand Jackeymo all eyes and all ears.\r\n\r\nThe house Randal had selected pleased Riccabocca at first glance. It stood\r\nalone, upon a little eminence; its upper windows commanded the high road.\r\nIt had been a school, and was surrounded by high walls, which contained a\r\ngarden and lawn sufficiently large for exercise. The garden doors were\r\nthick, fortified by strong bolts, and had a little wicket lattice, shut\r\nand opened at pleasure, from which Jackeymo could inspect all visitors\r\nbefore he permitted them to enter.\r\n\r\nAn old female servant from the neighborhood was cautiously hired;\r\nRiccabocca renounced his Italian name, and abjured his origin. He spoke\r\nEnglish sufficiently well to think he could pass as an Englishman. He\r\ncalled himself Mr. Richmouth (a liberal translation of Riccabocca). He\r\nbought a blunderbuss, two pair of pistols, and a huge house-dog. Thus\r\nprovided for, he allowed Jackeymo to write a line to Randal and\r\ncommunicate his arrival.\r\n\r\nRandal lost no time in calling. With his usual adaptability and his powers\r\nof dissimulation, he contrived easily to please Mrs. Riccabocca, and to\r\nincrease the good opinion the exile was disposed to form of him. He\r\nengaged Violante in conversation on Italy and its poets. He promised to\r\nbuy her books. He began, though more distantly than he could have\r\ndesired—for her sweet stateliness awed him in spite of himself—the\r\npreliminaries of courtship. He established himself at once as a familiar\r\nguest, riding down daily in the dusk of evening, after the toils of\r\noffice, and retiring at night. In four or five days he thought he had made\r\ngreat progress with all. Riccabocca watched him narrowly, and grew\r\nabsorbed in thought after every visit. At length one night, when he and\r\nMrs. Riccabocca were alone in the drawing-room, Violante having retired to\r\nrest, he thus spoke as he filled his pipe:—\r\n\r\n\"Happy is the man who has no children! Thrice happy he who has no girls.\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear Alphonso!\" said the wife, looking up from the wristband to which\r\nshe was attaching a neat mother-o’-pearl button. She said no more; it was\r\nthe sharpest rebuke she was in the custom of administering to her\r\nhusband’s cynical and odious observations. Riccabocca lighted his pipe\r\nwith a thread paper, gave three great puffs, and resumed:\r\n\r\n\"One blunderbuss, four pistols, and a house-dog called Pompey, who would\r\nhave made mince-meat of Julius Cæsar!\"\r\n\r\n\"He certainly eats a great deal, does Pompey!\" said Mrs. Riccabocca,\r\nsimply. \"But if he relieves your mind!\"\r\n\r\n\"He does not relieve it in the least, ma’am,\" groaned Riccabocca; \"and\r\nthat is the point I was coming to. This is a most harassing life, and a\r\nmost undignified life. And I who have only asked from Heaven dignity and\r\nrepose! But, if Violante were once married, I should want neither\r\nblunderbuss, pistol, nor Pompey. And it is that which would relieve my\r\nmind, _cara mia_;—Pompey only relieves my larder!\"\r\n\r\nNow Riccabocca had been more communicative to Jemima than he had been to\r\nViolante. Having once trusted her with one secret, he had every motive to\r\ntrust her with another; and he had accordingly spoken out his fears of the\r\nCount di Peschiera. Therefore she answered, laying down the work, and\r\ntaking her husband’s hand tenderly—\r\n\r\n\"Indeed, my love, since you dread so much (though I own that I must think\r\nunreasonably) this wicked, dangerous man, it would be the happiest thing\r\nin the world to see dear Violante well married; because, you see, if she\r\nis married to one person, she cannot be married to another; and all fear\r\nof this Count, as you say, would be at an end.\"\r\n\r\n\"You cannot express yourself better. It is a great comfort to unbosom\r\none’s self to a wife, after all!\" quoth Riccabocca.\r\n\r\n\"But,\" said the wife, after a grateful kiss—\"but where and how can we find\r\na husband suitable to the rank of your daughter?\"\r\n\r\n\"There—there—there,\" cried Riccabocca, pushing back his chair to the\r\nfarther end of the room—\"that comes of unbosoming one’s self! Out flies\r\none’s secret; it is opening the lid of Pandora’s box; one is betrayed,\r\nruined, undone!\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, there’s not a soul that can hear us!\" said Mrs. Riccabocca,\r\nsoothingly.\r\n\r\n\"That’s chance, ma’am! If you once contract the habit of blabbing out a\r\nsecret when nobody’s by, how on earth can you resist it when you have the\r\npleasurable excitement of telling it to all the world? Vanity,\r\nvanity—woman’s vanity! Woman never could withstand rank—never!\" The Doctor\r\nwent on railing for a quarter of an hour, and was very reluctantly\r\nappeased by Mrs. Riccabocca’s repeated and tearful assurances that she\r\nwould never even whisper to herself that her husband had ever held any\r\nother rank than that of Doctor.—Riccabocca, with a dubious shake of the\r\nhead, renewed—\r\n\r\n\"I have done with all pomp and pretension. Besides, the young man is a\r\nborn gentleman; he seems in good circumstances; he has energy and latent\r\nambition; he is akin to L’Estrange’s intimate friend; he seems attached to\r\nViolante. I don’t think it probable that we could do better. Nay, if\r\nPeschiera fears that I shall be restored to my country, and I learn the\r\nwherefore, and the ground to take, through this young man—why, gratitude\r\nis the first virtue of the noble!\"\r\n\r\n\"You speak, then, of Mr. Leslie?\"\r\n\r\n\"To be sure—of whom else?\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Riccabocca leaned her cheek on her hand thoughtfully. \"Now you have\r\ntold me _that_, I will observe him with different eyes.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Anima mia_, I don’t see how the difference of your eyes will alter the\r\nobject they look upon!\" grumbled Riccabocca, shaking the ashes out of his\r\npipe.\r\n\r\n\"The object alters when we see it in a different point of view!\" replied\r\nJemima, modestly. \"This thread does very well when I look at it in order\r\nto sew on a button, but I should say it would never do to tie up Pompey in\r\nhis kennel.\"\r\n\r\n\"Reasoning by illustration, upon my soul!\" ejaculated Riccabocca, amazed.\r\n\r\n\"And,\" continued Jemima, \"when I am to regard one who is to constitute the\r\nhappiness of that dear child, and for life, can I regard him as I would\r\nthe pleasant guest of an evening? Ah, trust me, Alphonso—I don’t pretend\r\nto be wise like you—but, when a woman considers what a man is likely to\r\nprove to woman—his sincerity—his honor—his heart—oh, trust me, she is\r\nwiser than the wisest man!\"\r\n\r\nRiccabocca continued to gaze on Jemima with unaffected admiration and\r\nsurprise. And, certainly, to use his phrase, since he had unbosomed\r\nhimself to his better half—since he had confided in her, consulted with\r\nher, her sense had seemed to quicken—her whole mind to expand.\r\n\r\n\"My dear,\" said the sage, \"I vow and declare that Machiavelli was a fool\r\nto you. And I have been as dull as the chair I sit upon, to deny myself so\r\nmany years the comfort and counsel of such a—but _corpo di Baccho!_ forget\r\nall about rank; and so now to bed.\"\r\n\r\n\"One must not holloa till one’s out of the wood,\" muttered the ungrateful,\r\nsuspicious villain, as he lighted the chamber candle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n\r\nRiccabocca could not confine himself to the precincts within the walls to\r\nwhich he condemned Violante. Resuming his spectacles, and wrapped in his\r\ncloak, he occasionally sallied forth upon a kind of outwatch or\r\nreconnoitring expedition—restricting himself, however, to the immediate\r\nneighborhood, and never going quite out of sight of his house. His\r\nfavorite walk was to the summit of a hillock overgrown with stunted\r\nbushwood. Here he would seat himself musingly, often till the hoofs of\r\nRandal’s horse rang on the winding road, as the sun set, over fading\r\nherbage, red and vaporous, in autumnal skies. Just below the hillock, and\r\nnot two hundred yards from his own house, was the only other habitation in\r\nview—a charming, thoroughly English cottage, though somewhat imitated from\r\nthe Swiss—with gable ends, thatched roof, and pretty projecting casements,\r\nopening through creepers and climbing roses. From his height he commanded\r\nthe gardens of this cottage, and his eye of artist was pleased, from the\r\nfirst sight, with the beauty which some exquisite taste had given to the\r\nground. Even in that cheerless season of the year, the garden wore a\r\nsummer smile; the evergreens were so bright and various, and the few\r\nflowers, still left, so hardy and so healthful. Facing the south, a\r\ncolonnade, or covered gallery, of rustic woodwork had been formed, and\r\ncreeping plants, lately set, were already beginning to clothe its columns.\r\nOpposite to this colonnade there was a fountain which reminded Riccabocca\r\nof his own at the deserted Casino. It was indeed singularly like it: the\r\nsame circular shape, the same girdle of flowers around it. But the jet\r\nfrom it varied every day—fantastic and multiform, like the sports of a\r\nNaïad—sometimes shooting up like a tree, sometimes shaped as a\r\nconvolvulus, sometimes tossing from its silver spray a flower of\r\nvermilion, or a fruit of gold—as if at play with its toy like a happy\r\nchild. And near the fountain was a large aviary, large enough to inclose a\r\ntree. The Italian could just catch a gleam of rich color from the wings of\r\nthe birds, as they glanced to and fro within the network, and could hear\r\ntheir songs, contrasting the silence of the free populace of air, whom the\r\ncoming winter had already stilled.\r\n\r\nRiccabocca’s eye, so alive to all aspects of beauty, luxuriated in the\r\nview of this garden. Its pleasantness had a charm that stole him from his\r\nanxious fear and melancholy memories.\r\n\r\nHe never saw but two forms within the demesnes, and he could not\r\ndistinguish their features. One was a woman, who seemed to him of staid\r\nmanner and homely appearance: she was seen but rarely. The other a man,\r\noften pacing to and fro the colonnade, with frequent pauses before the\r\nplayful fountain, or the birds that sang louder as he approached. This\r\nlatter form would then disappear within a room, the glass door of which\r\nwas at the extreme end of the colonnade; and if the door were left open,\r\nRiccabocca could catch a glimpse of the figure bending over a table\r\ncovered with books.\r\n\r\nAlways, however, before the sun set, the man would step forth more\r\nbriskly, and occupy himself with the garden, often working at it with good\r\nheart, as if at a task of delight; and then, too, the woman would come\r\nout, and stand by as if talking to her companion. Riccabocca’s curiosity\r\ngrew aroused. He bade Jemima inquire of the old maid-servant who lived at\r\nthe cottage, and heard that its owner was a Mr. Oran—a quiet gentleman,\r\nand fond of his book.\r\n\r\nWhile Riccabocca thus amused himself, Randal had not been prevented,\r\neither by his official cares or his schemes on Violante’s heart and\r\nfortune, from furthering the project that was to unite Frank Hazeldean and\r\nBeatrice di Negra. Indeed, as to the first, a ray of hope was sufficient\r\nto fire the ardent and unsuspecting lover. And Randal’s artful\r\nmisrepresentation of Mrs. Hazeldean’s conversation with him, removed all\r\nfear of parental displeasure from a mind always too disposed to give\r\nitself up to the temptation of the moment. Beatrice, though her feelings\r\nfor Frank were not those of love, became more and more influenced by\r\nRandal’s arguments and representations, the more especially as her brother\r\ngrew morose, and even menacing, as days slipt on, and she could give no\r\nclue to the retreat of those whom he sought for. Her debts, too, were\r\nreally urgent. As Randal’s profound knowledge of human infirmity had\r\nshrewdly conjectured, the scruples of honor and pride, that had made her\r\ndeclare she would not bring to a husband her own incumbrances, began to\r\nyield to the pressure of necessity. She listened already, with but faint\r\nobjections, when Randal urged her not to wait for the uncertain discovery\r\nthat was to secure her dowry, but by a private marriage with Frank escape\r\nat once into freedom and security. While, though he had first held out to\r\nyoung Hazeldean the inducement of Beatrice’s dowry as reason of\r\nself-justification in the eyes of the Squire, it was still easier to drop\r\nthat inducement, which had always rather damped than fired the high spirit\r\nand generous heart of the poor Guardsman. And Randal could conscientiously\r\nsay, that when he had asked the Squire if he expected fortune with Frank’s\r\nbride, the Squire had replied, \"I don’t care.\" Thus encouraged by his\r\nfriend and his own heart, and the softening manner of a woman who might\r\nhave charmed many a colder, and fooled many a wiser man, Frank rapidly\r\nyielded to the snares held out for his perdition. And though as yet he\r\nhonestly shrank from proposing to Beatrice or himself a marriage without\r\nthe consent, and even the knowledge, of his parents, yet Randal was quite\r\ncontent to leave a nature, however good, so thoroughly impulsive and\r\nundisciplined, to the influences of the first strong passion it had ever\r\nknown. Meanwhile, it was easy to dissuade Frank from even giving a hint to\r\nthe folks at home. \"For,\" said the wily and able traitor, \"though we may\r\nbe sure of Mrs. Hazeldean’s consent, and her power over your father, when\r\nthe step is once taken, yet we cannot count for certain on the Squire—he\r\nis so choleric and hasty. He might hurry to town—see Madame di Negra,\r\nblurt out some compassionate, rude expressions which would wake her\r\nresentment, and cause her instant rejection. And it might be too late if\r\nhe repented afterwards—as he would be sure to do.\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Randal Leslie gave a dinner at the Clarendon Hotel (an\r\nextravagance most contrary to his habits), and invited Frank, Mr.\r\nBorrowell, and Baron Levy.\r\n\r\nBut this house-spider, which glided with so much ease after its flies,\r\nthrough webs so numerous and mazy, had yet to amuse Madame di Negra with\r\nassurances that the fugitives sought for would sooner or later be\r\ndiscovered. Though Randal baffled and eluded her suspicion that he was\r\nalready acquainted with the exiles, (\"the persons he had thought of were,\"\r\nhe said, \"quite different from her description;\" and he even presented to\r\nher an old singing-master, and a sallow-faced daughter, as the Italians\r\nwho had caused his mistake), it was necessary for Beatrice to prove the\r\nsincerity of the aid she had promised to her brother, and to introduce\r\nRandal to the Count. It was no less desirable to Randal to know, and even\r\nwin the confidence of this man—his rival.\r\n\r\nThe two met at Madame di Negra’s house. There is something very strange,\r\nand almost mesmerical, in the _rapport_ between two evil natures. Bring\r\ntwo honest men together, and it is ten to one if they recognize each other\r\nas honest; differences in temper, manner, even politics, may make each\r\nmisjudge the other. But bring together two men, unprincipled and\r\nperverted—men who, if born in a cellar, would have been food for the hulks\r\nor gallows—and they recognize each other by instant sympathy. The eyes of\r\nFranzini, Count of Peschiera, and Randal Leslie no sooner met, than a\r\ngleam of intelligence shot from both. They talked on indifferent\r\nsubjects—weather, gossip, politics—what not. They bowed and they smiled;\r\nbut, all the while, each was watching, plumbing the other’s heart; each\r\nmeasuring his strength with his companion; each inly saying, \"This is a\r\nvery remarkable rascal; am I a match for him?\" It was at dinner they met;\r\nand, following the English fashion, Madame di Negra left them alone with\r\ntheir wine.\r\n\r\nThen, for the first time, Count di Peschiera cautiously and adroitly made\r\na covered push towards the object of the meeting.\r\n\r\n\"You have never been abroad, my dear sir? You must contrive to visit me at\r\nVienna. I grant the splendor of your London world; but, honestly speaking,\r\nit wants the freedom of ours—a freedom which unites gayety with polish.\r\nFor as your society is mixed, there are pretension and effort with those\r\nwho have no right to be in it, and artificial condescension and chilling\r\narrogance with those who have to keep their inferiors at a certain\r\ndistance. With us, all being of fixed rank and acknowledged birth,\r\nfamiliarity is at once established.\" \"Hence,\" added the Count, with his\r\nFrench lively smile—\"hence there is no place like Vienna for a young\r\nman—no place like Vienna for _bonnes fortunes_.\"\r\n\r\n\"Those make the paradise of the idle,\" replied Randal, \"but the purgatory\r\nof the busy. I confess frankly to you, my dear Count, that I have as\r\nlittle of the leisure which becomes the aspirer to _bonnes fortunes_ as I\r\nhave the personal graces which obtain them without an effort;\" and he\r\ninclined his head as in compliment.\r\n\r\n\"So,\" thought the Count, \"woman is not his weak side. What is?\"\r\n\r\n\"_Morbleu!_ my dear Mr. Leslie—had I thought as you do some years since, I\r\nhad saved myself from many a trouble. After all, Ambition is the best\r\nmistress to woo; for with her there is always the hope, and never the\r\npossession.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ambition, Count,\" replied Randal, still guarding himself in dry\r\nsententiousness, \"is the luxury of the rich, and the necessity of the\r\npoor.\"\r\n\r\n\"Aha,\" thought the Count, \"it comes, as I anticipated from the first—comes\r\nto the bribe.\" He passed the wine to Randal, filling his own glass, and\r\ndraining it carelessly: \"_Sur mon âme, mon cher_,\" said the Count, \"luxury\r\nis ever pleasanter than necessity; and I am resolved at least to give\r\nambition a trial—_je vais me réfugier dans le sein du bonheur\r\ndomestique_—a married life and a settled home. _Peste!_ If it were not for\r\nambition, one would die of ennui. Apropos, my dear sir, I have to thank\r\nyou for promising my sister your aid in finding a near and dear kinsman of\r\nmine, who has taken refuge in your country, and hides himself even from\r\nme.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should be most happy to assist in your search. As yet, however, I have\r\nonly to regret that all my good wishes are fruitless. I should have\r\nthought, however, that a man of such rank had been easily found, even\r\nthrough the medium of your own ambassador.\"\r\n\r\n\"Our own ambassador is no very warm friend of mine; and the rank would be\r\nno clue, for it is clear that my kinsman has never assumed it since he\r\nquitted his country.\"\r\n\r\n\"He quitted it, I understand, not exactly from choice,\" said Randal,\r\nsmiling. \"Pardon my freedom and curiosity, but will you explain to me a\r\nlittle more than I learn from English rumor (which never accurately\r\nreports upon foreign matters still more notorious), how a person who had\r\nso much to lose, and so little to win, by revolution, could put himself\r\ninto the same crazy boat with a crew of hare-brained adventurers and\r\nvisionary professors?\r\n\r\n\"Professors!\" repeated the Count; \"I think you have hit on the very answer\r\nto your question; not but what men of high birth were as mad as the\r\n_canaille_. I am the more willing to gratify your curiosity, since it will\r\nperhaps serve to guide your kind search in my favor. You must know, then,\r\nthat my kinsman was not born the heir to the rank he obtained. He was but\r\na distant relation to the head of the house which he afterwards\r\nrepresented. Brought up in an Italian university, he was distinguished for\r\nhis learning and his eccentricities. There, too, I suppose, brooding over\r\nold wives’ tales about freedom, and so forth, he contracted his\r\n_carbonaro_, chimerical notions for the independence of Italy. Suddenly,\r\nby three deaths, he was elevated, while yet young, to a station and honors\r\nwhich might have satisfied any man in his senses. _Que diable!_ what could\r\nthe independence of Italy do for _him_! He and I were cousins; we had\r\nplayed together as boys; but our lives had been separated till his\r\nsuccession to rank brought us necessarily together. We became exceedingly\r\nintimate. And you may judge how I loved him,\" said the Count, averting his\r\neyes slightly from Randal’s quiet, watchful gaze, \"when I add, that I\r\nforgave him for enjoying a heritage that, but for him, had been mine.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, you were next heir?\"\r\n\r\n\"And it is a hard trial to be very near a great fortune, and yet just miss\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\n\"True,\" cried Randal, almost impetuously. The Count now raised his eyes,\r\nand again the two men looked into each other’s souls.\r\n\r\n\"Harder still, perhaps,\" resumed the Count, after a short pause—\"harder\r\nstill might it have been to some men to forgive the rival as well as the\r\nheir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Rival! How?\"\r\n\r\n\"A lady, who had been destined by her parents to myself, though we had\r\nnever, I own, been formally betrothed, became the wife of my kinsman.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did he know of your pretensions?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do him the justice to say he did not. He saw and fell in love with the\r\nyoung lady I speak of. Her parents were dazzled. Her father sent for me.\r\nHe apologized—he explained; he set before me, mildly enough, certain\r\nyouthful imprudences or errors of my own, as an excuse for his change of\r\nmind; and he asked me not only to resign all hope of his daughter, but to\r\nconceal from her new suitor that I had ever ventured to hope.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you consented?\"\r\n\r\n\"I consented.\"\r\n\r\n\"That was generous. You must indeed have been much attached to your\r\nkinsman. As a lover I cannot comprehend it; perhaps, my dear Count, you\r\nmay enable me to understand it better—as a man of the world.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said the Count, with his most _roué_ air, \"I suppose we _are_ both\r\nmen of the world?\"\r\n\r\n\"_Both!_ certainly,\" replied Randal, just in the tone which Peachum might\r\nhave used in courting the confidence of Lockit.\r\n\r\n\"As a man of the world, then, I own,\" said the Count, playing with the\r\nrings on his fingers, \"that if I could not marry the lady myself (and that\r\nseemed to me clear), it was very natural that I should wish to see her\r\nmarried to my wealthy kinsman.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very natural; it might bring your wealthy kinsman and yourself still\r\ncloser together.\"\r\n\r\n\"This is really a very clever fellow!\" thought the Count, but he made no\r\ndirect reply.\r\n\r\n\"_Enfin_, to cut short a long story, my cousin afterwards got entangled in\r\nattempts, the failure of which is historically known. His projects were\r\ndetected—himself denounced. He fled, and the Emperor, in sequestrating his\r\nestates, was pleased, with rare and singular clemency, to permit me, as\r\nhis nearest kinsman, to enjoy the revenues of half those estates during\r\nthe royal pleasure; nor was the other half formally confiscated. It was no\r\ndoubt his Majesty’s desire not to extinguish a great Italian name; and if\r\nmy cousin and his child died in exile, why, of that name, I, a loyal\r\nsubject of Austria—I, Franzini, Count di Peschiera, would become the\r\nrepresentative. Such, in a similar case, has been sometimes the Russian\r\npolicy towards Polish insurgents.\"\r\n\r\n\"I comprehend perfectly; and I can also conceive that you, in profiting so\r\nlargely, though so justly, by the fall of your kinsman, may have been\r\nexposed to much unpopularity—even to painful suspicion.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Entre nous, mon cher_, I care not a stiver for popularity; and as to\r\nsuspicion, who is he that can escape from the calumny of the envious? But,\r\nunquestionably, it would be most desirable to unite the divided members of\r\nour house; and this union I can now effect, by the consent of the Emperor\r\nto my marriage with my kinsman’s daughter. You see, therefore, why I have\r\nso great an interest in this research?\"\r\n\r\n\"By the marriage articles you could no doubt secure the retention of the\r\nhalf you hold; and if you survive your kinsman, you would enjoy the whole.\r\nA most desirable marriage; and, if made, I suppose that would suffice to\r\nobtain your cousin’s amnesty and grace?\"\r\n\r\n\"You say it.\"\r\n\r\n\"But even without such marriage, since the Emperor’s clemency has been\r\nextended to so many of the proscribed, it is perhaps probable that your\r\ncousin might be restored?\"\r\n\r\n\"It once seemed to me possible,\" said the Count, reluctantly; \"but since I\r\nhave been in England, I think not. The recent revolution in France, the\r\ndemocratic spirit rising in Europe, tend to throw back the cause of a\r\nproscribed rebel. England swarms with revolutionists; my cousin’s\r\nresidence in this country is in itself suspicious. The suspicion is\r\nincreased by his strange seclusion. There are many Italians here who would\r\naver that they had met with him, and that he was still engaged in\r\nrevolutionary projects.\"\r\n\r\n\"Aver—untruly.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Ma foi_—it comes to the same thing; _les absens ont toujours tort_. I\r\nspeak to a man of the world. No; without some such guarantee for his\r\nfaith, as his daughter’s marriage with myself would give, his recall is\r\nimprobable. By the heaven above us, it shall be _impossible_!\" The Count\r\nrose as he said this—rose as if the mask of simulation had fairly fallen\r\nfrom the visage of crime—rose tall and towering, a very image of masculine\r\npower and strength, beside the slight bended form and sickly face of the\r\nintellectual schemer. Randal was startled; but, rising also, he said\r\ncarelessly—\r\n\r\n\"What if this guarantee can no longer be given?—what if, in despair of\r\nreturn, and in resignation to his altered fortunes, your cousin has\r\nalready married his daughter to some English suitor?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, that would indeed be, next to my own marriage with her, the most\r\nfortunate thing that could happen to myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"How? I don’t understand!\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, if my cousin has so abjured his birthright, and forsworn his rank—if\r\nthis heritage, which is so dangerous from its grandeur, pass, in case of\r\nhis pardon, to some obscure Englishman—a foreigner—a native of a country\r\nthat has no ties with ours—a country that is the very refuge of levellers\r\nand Carbonari—_mort dema vie_—do you think that such would not annihilate\r\nall chance of my cousin’s restoration, and be an excuse even to the eyes\r\nof Italy for formally conferring the sequestered estates on an Italian?\r\nNo; unless, indeed, the girl were to marry an Englishman of such name and\r\nbirth and connection as would in themselves be a guarantee, (and how in\r\npoverty is this likely?) I should go back to Vienna with a light heart, if\r\nI could say, ’My kinswoman is an Englishman’s wife—shall her children be\r\nthe heirs to a house so renowned for its lineage, and so formidable for\r\nits wealth?’ _Parbleu!_ if my cousin were but an adventurer, or merely a\r\nprofessor, he had been pardoned long ago. The great enjoy the honor not to\r\nbe pardoned easily.\"\r\n\r\nRandal fell into deep but brief thought. The Count observed him, not face\r\nto face, but by the reflection of an opposite mirror. \"This man knows\r\nsomething; this man is deliberating; this man can help me,\" thought the\r\nCount.\r\n\r\nBut Randal said nothing to confirm these hypotheses. Recovering from his\r\nabstraction, he expressed courteously his satisfaction at the Count’s\r\nprospects, either way. \"And since, after all,\" he added, \"you mean so well\r\nto your cousin, it occurs to me that you might discover him by a very\r\nsimple English process.\"\r\n\r\n\"How?\"\r\n\r\n\"Advertise that, if he will come to some place appointed, he will hear of\r\nsomething to his advantage.\"\r\n\r\nThe Count shook his head. \"He would suspect me, and not come.\"\r\n\r\n\"But he was intimate with you. He joined an insurrection;—you were more\r\nprudent. You did not injure him, though you may have benefited yourself.\r\nWhy should he shun you?\"\r\n\r\n\"The conspirators forgive none who do not conspire; besides, to speak\r\nfrankly, he thought I injured him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Could you not conciliate him through his wife—whom—you resigned to him?\"\r\n\r\n\"She is dead—died before he left the country.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, that is unlucky! Still I think an advertisement might do good. Allow\r\nme to reflect on that subject. Shall we now join Madame la Marquise?\"\r\n\r\nOn re-entering the drawing-room, the gentlemen found Beatrice in full\r\ndress, seated by the fire, and reading so intently that she did not remark\r\nthem enter.\r\n\r\n\"What so interests you, _ma sœur_?-the last novel by Balzac, no doubt?\"\r\n\r\nBeatrice started, and, looking up, showed eyes that were full of tears.\r\n\"Oh, no! no picture of miserable, vicious Parisian life. This is\r\nbeautiful; there is _soul_ here.\"\r\n\r\nRandal took up the book which the Marchesa laid down; it was the same that\r\nhad charmed the circle at Hazeldean—charmed the innocent and\r\nfresh-hearted—charmed now the wearied and tempted votaress of the world.\r\n\r\n\"Hum,\" murmured Randal; \"the Parson, was right. This is power—a sort of a\r\npower.\"\r\n\r\n\"How I should like to know the author! Who can he be—can you guess?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not I. Some old pedant in spectacles.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think not—I am sure not. Here beats a heart I have ever sighed to find,\r\nand never found.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, _naïve enfant_!\" cried the Count; \"_comme son imagination s’égare en\r\nrêves enchantés_. And to think that, while you talk like an Arcadian, you\r\nare dressed like a princess.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, I forgot—the Austrian ambassador’s. I shall not go to-night. This\r\nbook unfits me for the artificial world.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just as you will, my sister. I shall go. I dislike the man, and he me;\r\nbut ceremonies before men!\"\r\n\r\n\"You are going to the Austrian Embassy?\" said Randal. \"I too shall be\r\nthere. We shall meet.\" And he took his leave.\r\n\r\n\"I like your young friend prodigiously,\" said the Count, yawning. \"I am\r\nsure that he knows of the lost birds, and will stand to them like a\r\npointer, if I can but make it his interest to do so. We shall see.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n\r\nRandal arrived at the ambassador’s before the Count, and contrived to mix\r\nwith the young noblemen attached to the embassy, and to whom he was known.\r\nStanding among these was a young Austrian, on his travels, of very high\r\nbirth, and with an air of noble grace that suited the ideal of the old\r\nGerman chivalry. Randal was presented to him, and, after some talk on\r\ngeneral topics, observed, \"By the way, Prince, there is now in London a\r\ncountryman of yours, with whom you are doubtless familiarly acquainted—the\r\nCount di Peschiera.\"\r\n\r\n\"He is no countryman of mine. He is an Italian. I know him but by sight\r\nand by name,\" said the Prince, stiffly.\r\n\r\n\"He is of very ancient birth, I believe.\"\r\n\r\n\"Unquestionably. His ancestors were gentlemen.\"\r\n\r\n\"And very rich.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed! I have understood the contrary. He enjoys, it is true, a large\r\nrevenue.\"\r\n\r\nA young _attaché_, less discreet than the Prince, here observed, \"Oh,\r\nPeschiera!—Poor fellow, he is too fond of play to be rich.\"\r\n\r\n\"And there is some chance that the kinsman whose revenue he holds, may\r\nobtain his pardon, and re-enter into possession of his fortunes—so I hear,\r\nat least,\" said Randal, artfully.\r\n\r\n\"I shall be glad if it be true,\" said the Prince with decision; \"and I\r\nspeak the common sentiment at Vienna. That kinsman had a noble spirit, and\r\nwas, I believe, equally duped and betrayed. Pardon me, sir; but we\r\nAustrians are not so bad as we are painted. Have you ever met in England\r\nthe kinsman you speak of?\"\r\n\r\n\"Never, though he is supposed to reside here; and the Count tells me that\r\nhe has a daughter.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Count—ha! I heard something of a scheme—a wager of that—that\r\nCount’s—a daughter. Poor girl! I hope she will escape his pursuit; for, no\r\ndoubt, he pursues her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Possibly she may already have married an Englishman.\"\r\n\r\n\"I trust not,\" said the Prince, seriously; \"that might at present be a\r\nserious obstacle to her father’s return.\"\r\n\r\n\"You think so?\"\r\n\r\n\"There can be no doubt of it,\" interposed the _attaché_ with a grand and\r\npositive air; \"unless, indeed, the Englishman were of a rank equal to her\r\nown.\"\r\n\r\nHere there was a slight, well-bred murmur and buzz at the doors; for the\r\nCount di Peschiera himself was announced; and as he entered, his presence\r\nwas so striking, and his beauty so dazzling, that whatever there might be\r\nto the prejudice of his character, it seemed instantly effaced or\r\nforgotten in that irresistible admiration which it is the prerogative of\r\npersonal attributes alone to create.\r\n\r\nThe Prince, with a slight curve of his lip at the groups that collected\r\nround the Count, turned to Randal and said, \"Can you tell me if a\r\ndistinguished countryman of yours is in England—Lord L’Estrange?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, Prince—he is not. You know him?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well.\"\r\n\r\n\"He is acquainted with the Count’s kinsman; and perhaps from him you have\r\nlearned to think so highly of that kinsman?\"\r\n\r\nThe Prince bowed, and answered as he moved away, \"When a man of high honor\r\nvouches for another, he commands the belief of all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly,\" soliloquized Randal, \"I must not be precipitate. I was very\r\nnearly falling into a terrible trap. If I were to marry the girl, and\r\nonly, by so doing, settle away her inheritance on Peschiera!—How hard it\r\nis to be sufficiently cautious in this world!\"\r\n\r\nWhile thus meditating, a member of Parliament tapped him on the shoulder.\r\n\r\n\"Melancholy, Leslie! I lay a wager I guess your thoughts.\"\r\n\r\n\"Guess,\" answered Randal.\r\n\r\n\"You were thinking of the place you are so soon to lose.\"\r\n\r\n\"Soon to lose!\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, if ministers go out, you could hardly keep it, I suppose.\"\r\n\r\nThis ominous and horrid member of Parliament, Squire Hazeldean’s favorite\r\ncounty member, Sir John, was one of those legislators especially odious to\r\nofficials—an independent \"large-acred\" member, who would no more take\r\noffice himself than he would cut down the oaks in his park, and who had no\r\nbowels of human feeling for those who had opposite tastes and less\r\nmagnificent means.\r\n\r\n\"Hem!\" said Randal, rather surlily. \"In the first place, Sir John,\r\nministers are not going out.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes, they will go. You know I vote with them generally, and would\r\nwillingly keep them in; but they are men of honor and spirit; and if they\r\ncan’t carry their measures, they must resign; otherwise, by Jove, I would\r\nturn round and vote them out myself!\"\r\n\r\n\"I have no doubt you would, Sir John; you are quite capable of it; that\r\nrests with you and your constituents. But even if ministers did go out, I\r\nam but a poor subaltern in a public office. I am no minister—why should I\r\ngo out too?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why? Hang it, Leslie, you are laughing at me. A young fellow like you\r\ncould never be mean enough to stay in, under the very men who drove out\r\nyour friend Egerton!\"\r\n\r\n\"It is not usual for those in the public offices to retire with every\r\nchange of Government.\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly not; but always those who are the relations of a retiring\r\nminister—always those who have been regarded as politicians, and who mean\r\nto enter Parliament, as of course you will do at the next election. But\r\nyou know that as well as I do—you who are so decided a politician—the\r\nwriter of that admirable pamphlet! I should not like to tell my friend\r\nHazeldean, who has a sincere interest in you, that you ever doubted on a\r\nquestion of honor as plain as your A, B, C.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed, Sir John,\" said Randal, recovering his suavity, while he inly\r\nbreathed a dire anathema on his county member, \"I am so new to these\r\nthings, that what you say never struck me before. No doubt you must be\r\nright; at all events, I cannot have a better guide and adviser than Mr.\r\nEgerton himself.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, certainly—perfect gentleman, Egerton! I wish we could make it up with\r\nhim and Hazeldean.\"\r\n\r\n_Randal_, (sighing)—\"Ah, I wish we could!\"\r\n\r\n_Sir John._—\"And some chance of it now; for the time is coming when all\r\ntrue men of the old school must stick together.\"\r\n\r\n_Randal._—\"Wisely, and admirably said, my dear Sir John. But, pardon me, I\r\nmust pay my respects to the ambassador.\"\r\n\r\nRandal escaped, and, passing on, saw the ambassador himself in the next\r\nroom, conferring in a corner with Audley Egerton. The ambassador seemed\r\nvery grave—Egerton calm and impenetrable, as usual. Presently the Count\r\npassed by, and the ambassador bowed to him very stiffly. As Randal, some\r\ntime later, was searching for his cloak below, Audley Egerton unexpectedly\r\njoined him. \"Ah, Leslie,\" said the minister, with more kindness than\r\nusual, \"if you don’t think the night air too cold for you, let us walk\r\nhome together. I have sent away the carriage.\"\r\n\r\nThis condescension in his patron was so singular that it quite startled\r\nRandal, and gave him a presentiment of some evil. When they were in the\r\nstreet, Egerton, after a pause, began—\"My dear Mr. Leslie, it was my hope\r\nand belief that I had provided for you at least a competence; and that I\r\nmight open to you, later, a career yet more brilliant. Hush! I don’t doubt\r\nyour gratitude; let me proceed. There is a possible chance, after certain\r\ndecisions that the Government have come to, that we may be beaten in the\r\nHouse of Commons, and of course resign. I tell you this beforehand, for I\r\nwish you to have time to consider what, in that case, would be your best\r\ncourse. My power of serving you would then probably be over. It would, no\r\ndoubt (seeing our close connection, and my views with regard to your\r\nfuture being so well known)—be expected that you should give up the place\r\nyou hold, and follow my fortunes for good or ill. But as I have no\r\npersonal enemies with the opposite party—and as I have sufficient position\r\nin the world to uphold and sanction your choice, whatever it may be, if\r\nyou think it more prudent to retain your place, tell me so openly, and I\r\nthink I can contrive that you may do it without loss of character and\r\ncredit. In that case confine your ambition merely to rising gradually in\r\nyour office, without mixing in politics. If, on the other hand, you should\r\nprefer to take your chance of my return to office, and so resign your own;\r\nand, furthermore, should commit yourself to a policy that may then be not\r\nonly in opposition, but unpopular; I will do my best to introduce you into\r\nparliamentary life. I cannot say that I advise the latter.\"\r\n\r\nRandal felt as a man feels after a severe fall—he was literally stunned.\r\nAt length he faltered out—\"Can you think, sir, that I should ever desert\r\nyour fortunes—your party—your cause?\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear Leslie,\" replied the minister, \"you are too young to have\r\ncommitted yourself to any men or to any party, except, indeed, in that\r\nunlucky pamphlet. This must not be an affair of sentiment, but of sense\r\nand reflection. Let us say no more on the point now; but, by considering\r\nthe _pros_ and _cons_, you can better judge what to do, should the time\r\nfor option suddenly arrive.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I hope that time may not come.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope so too, and most sincerely,\" said the minister, with deliberate\r\nand genuine emphasis.\r\n\r\n\"What could be so bad for the country?\" ejaculated Randal. \"It does not\r\nseem to me possible in the nature of things, that you and your party\r\nshould ever go out.\"\r\n\r\n\"And when we are once out, there will be plenty of wiseacres to say it is\r\nout of the nature of things that we should ever come in again. Here we are\r\nat the door.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n\r\nRandal passed a sleepless night; but, indeed, he was one of those persons\r\nwho neither need, nor are accustomed to much sleep. However, towards\r\nmorning, when dreams are said to be prophetic, he fell into a most\r\ndelightful slumber—a slumber peopled by visions fitted to lure on, through\r\nlabyrinths of law, predestined chancellors, or wreck upon the rocks of\r\nglory the inebriate souls of youthful ensigns—dreams from which Rood Hall\r\nemerged crowned with the towers of Belvoir or Raby, and looking over\r\nsubject lands and manors wrested from the nefarious usurpation of\r\nThornhills and Hazeldeans—dreams in which Audley Egerton’s gold and\r\npower—rooms in Downing Street, and saloons in Grosvenor Square—had passed\r\naway to the smiling dreamer, as the empire of Chaldæa passed to Darius the\r\nMedian. Why visions so belying the gloomy and anxious thoughts that\r\npreceded them should visit the pillow of Randal Leslie, surpasses my\r\nphilosophy to conjecture. He yielded, however, passively to their spell,\r\nand was startled to hear the clock strike eleven as he descended the\r\nstairs to breakfast. He was vexed at the lateness of the hour, for he had\r\nmeant to have taken advantage of the unwonted softness of Egerton, and\r\ndrawn therefrom some promises or proffers to cheer the prospects which the\r\nminister had so chillingly expanded before him the preceding night. And it\r\nwas only at breakfast that he usually found the opportunity of private\r\nconference with his busy patron. But Audley Egerton would be sure to have\r\nsallied forth—and so he had—only Randal was surprised to hear that he had\r\ngone out in his carriage, instead of on foot, as was his habit. Randal\r\nsoon despatched his solitary meal, and with a new and sudden affection for\r\nhis office, thitherward bent his way. As he passed through Piccadilly, he\r\nheard behind a voice that had lately become familiar to him, and turning\r\nround, saw Baron Levy walking side by side, though not arm-in-arm, with a\r\ngentleman almost as smart as himself, but with a jauntier step and a\r\nbrisker air—a step that, like Diomed’s, as described by Shakspeare—\r\n\r\n  \"Rises on the toe—that spirit of his\r\n  In aspiration lifts him from the earth.\"\r\n\r\nIndeed, one may judge of the spirits and disposition of a man by his\r\nordinary gait and mien in walking. He who habitually pursues abstract\r\nthought, looks down on the ground. He who is accustomed to sudden\r\nimpulses, or is trying to seize upon some necessary recollection, looks up\r\nwith a kind of jerk. He who is a steady, cautious, merely practical man,\r\nwalks on deliberately, his eyes straight before him; and even in his most\r\nmusing moods observes things around sufficiently to avoid a porter’s knot\r\nor a butcher’s tray.—But the man with strong ganglions—of pushing lively\r\ntemperament, who, though practical, is yet speculative—the man who is\r\nemulous and active, and ever trying to rise in life—sanguine, alert,\r\nbold—walks with a spring—looks rather above the heads of his\r\nfellow-passengers—but with a quick, easy turn of his own, which is lightly\r\nset on his shoulders; his mouth is a little open—his eye is bright, rather\r\nrestless, but penetrative—his port has something of defiance—his form is\r\nerect, but without stiffness. Such was the appearance of the Baron’s\r\ncompanion. And as Randal turned round at Levy’s voice, the Baron said to\r\nhis companion, \"A young man in the first circles—you should book him for\r\nyour fair lady’s parties. How d’ye do, Mr. Leslie? Let me introduce you to\r\nMr. Richard Avenel.\" Then, as he hooked his arm into Randal’s, he\r\nwhispered, \"Man of first-rate talent—monstrously rich—has two or three\r\nparliamentary seats in his pocket—wife gives parties—her foible.\"\r\n\r\n\"Proud to make your acquaintance, sir,\" said Mr. Avenel, lifting his hat.\r\n\"Fine day.\"\r\n\r\n\"Rather cold, too,\" said Leslie, who, like all thin persons with weak\r\ndigestion, was chilly by temperament; besides, he had enough on his mind\r\nto chill his body.\r\n\r\n\"So much the healthier,—braces the nerves,\" said Mr. Avenel; \"but you\r\nyoung fellows relax the system by hot rooms and late hours. Fond of\r\ndancing, of course, sir?\" Then, without waiting for Randal’s negative, Mr.\r\nRichard continued rapidly, \"Mrs. Avenel has a _soirée dansante_ on\r\nThursday—shall be very happy to see you in Eaton Square. Stop, I have a\r\ncard;\" and he drew out a dozen large invitation cards, from which he\r\nselected one and presented it to Randal.—The Baron pressed that young\r\ngentleman’s arm, and Randal replied courteously that it would give him\r\ngreat pleasure to be introduced to Mrs. Avenel. Then, as he was not\r\ndesirous to be seen under the wing of Baron Levy, like a pigeon under that\r\nof a hawk, he gently extricated himself, and, pleading great haste, walked\r\nquickly on towards his office.\r\n\r\n\"That young man will make a figure some day,\" said the Baron. \"I don’t\r\nknow any one of his age with so few prejudices. He is a connection by\r\nmarriage to Audley Egerton, who\"—\r\n\r\n\"Audley Egerton!\" exclaimed Mr. Avenel; \"d ungrateful fellow?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, what do you know of him?\"\r\n\r\n\"He owed his first seat in Parliament to the votes of two near relations\r\nof mine, and when I called upon him some time ago, in his office, he\r\nabsolutely ordered me out of the room. Hang his impertinence; if ever I\r\ncan pay him off, I guess I shan’t fail for want of good will!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ordered you out of the room? That’s not like Egerton, who is civil, if\r\nformal—at least, to most men. You must have offended him in his weak\r\npoint.\"\r\n\r\n\"A man whom the public pays so handsomely should have no weak point. What\r\nis Egerton’s?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, he values himself on being a thorough gentleman—a man of the nicest\r\nhonor,\" said Levy with a sneer. \"You must have ruffled his plumes there.\r\nHow was it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I forget now,\" answered Mr. Avenel, who was far too well versed in the\r\nLondon scale of human dignities since his marriage, not to look back with\r\na blush at his desire of knighthood. \"No use bothering our heads now about\r\nthe plumes of an arrogant popinjay. To return to the subject we were\r\ndiscussing. You must be sure to let me have this money next week.\"\r\n\r\n\"Rely upon it.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you’ll not let my bills get into the market; keep them under lock and\r\nkey.\"\r\n\r\n\"So we agreed.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is but a temporary difficulty—royal mourning, such nonsense—panic in\r\ntrade, lest these precious ministers go out. I shall soon float over the\r\ntroubled waters.\"\r\n\r\n\"By the help of a paper boat,\" said the Baron, laughing; and the two\r\ngentlemen shook hands and parted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Audley Egerton’s carriage had deposited him at the door of Lord\r\nLansmere’s house, at Knightsbridge. He asked for the Countess, and was\r\nshown into the drawing-room, which was deserted. Egerton was paler than\r\nusual; and, as the door opened, he wiped the unwonted moisture from his\r\nforehead, and there was a quiver in his firm lip. The Countess, too, on\r\nentering, showed an emotion almost equally unusual to her self-control.\r\nShe pressed Audley’s hand in silence, and seating herself by his side,\r\nseemed to collect her thoughts. At length she said: \"It is rarely indeed\r\nthat we meet, Mr. Egerton, in spite of your intimacy with Lansmere and\r\nHarley. I go so little into your world, and you will not voluntarily come\r\nto me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Madam,\" replied Egerton, \"I might evade your kind reproach by stating\r\nthat my hours are not at my disposal; but I answer you with plain truth—it\r\nmust be painful to both of us to meet.\"\r\n\r\nThe Countess colored and sighed, but did not dispute the assertion. Audley\r\nresumed. \"And therefore, I presume, that on sending for me, you have\r\nsomething of moment to communicate.\"\r\n\r\n\"It relates to Harley,\" said the Countess, as if in apology; \"and I would\r\ntake your advice.\"\r\n\r\n\"To Harley! speak on, I beseech you.\"\r\n\r\n\"My son has probably told you that he has educated and reared a young\r\ngirl, with the intention to make her Lady L’Estrange, and hereafter\r\nCountess of Lansmere.\"\r\n\r\n\"Harley has no secrets from me,\" said Egerton, mournfully.\r\n\r\n\"This young lady has arrived in England—is here—in this house.\"\r\n\r\n\"And Harley too?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, she came over with Lady N her daughters. Harley was to follow\r\nshortly, and I expect him daily. Here is his letter. Observe, he has never\r\nyet communicated his intentions to this young person, now intrusted to my\r\ncare—never spoken to her as the lover.\"\r\n\r\nEgerton took the letter and read it rapidly, though with attention.\r\n\r\n\"True,\" said he, as he returned the letter: \"and before he does so, he\r\nwishes you to see Miss Digby and to judge of her yourself—wishes to know\r\nif you will approve and sanction his choice.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is on this that I would consult you—a girl without rank;—the father,\r\nit is true, a gentleman, though almost equivocally one,—but the mother, I\r\nknow not what. And Harley for whom I hoped an alliance with the first\r\nhouses in England!\" The Countess pressed her hands convulsively together.\r\n\r\n_Egerton._—\"He is no more a boy. His talents have been wasted—his life a\r\nwanderer’s. He presents to you a chance of re-settling his mind, of\r\nre-arousing his native powers, of a home besides your own. Lady Lansmere,\r\nyou cannot hesitate!\"\r\n\r\n_Lady Lansmere._—\"I do, I do! After all that I have hoped, after all that\r\nI did to prevent\"—\r\n\r\n_Egerton_ (interrupting her).—\"You owe him now an atonement: that is in\r\nyour power—it is not in mine.\"\r\n\r\nThe Countess again pressed Audley’s hand, and the tears gushed from her\r\neyes. \"It shall be so. I consent—I consent. I will silence, I will crush\r\nback this proud heart. Alas! it wellnigh broke his own! I am glad you\r\nspeak thus. I like to think he owes my consent to you. In that there is\r\natonement for both—both.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are too generous, madam,\" said Egerton, evidently moved, though\r\nstill, as ever, striving to repress emotion. \"And may I see the young\r\nlady? This conference pains me; you see even my strong nerves quiver; and\r\nat this time I have much to go through—need of all my strength and\r\nfirmness.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hear, indeed, that the government will probably retire. But it is with\r\nhonor: it will be soon called back by the voice of the nation.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let me see the future wife of Harley L’Estrange,\" said Egerton, without\r\nheed of this consolatory exclamation.\r\n\r\nThe Countess rose and left the room. In a few minutes she returned with\r\nHelen Digby. Helen was wondrously improved from the pale, delicate child,\r\nwith the soft smile and intelligent eyes, who had sat by the side of\r\nLeonard in his garret. She was about the middle height, still slight but\r\nbeautifully formed; that exquisite roundness of proportion, which conveys\r\nso well the idea of woman, in its undulating pliant grace—formed to\r\nembellish life, and soften away its rude angles—formed to embellish, not\r\nto protect. Her face might not have satisfied the critical eye of an\r\nartist—it was not without defects in regularity; but its expression was\r\neminently gentle and prepossessing; and there were few who would not have\r\nexclaimed, \"What a lovely countenance!\" The mildness of her brow was\r\ntouched with melancholy—her childhood had left its traces on her youth.\r\nHer step was slow, and her manner shy, subdued, and timid. Audley gazed on\r\nher with earnestness as she approached him; and then coming forward, took\r\nher hand and kissed it. \"I am your guardian’s constant friend,\" said he;\r\nand he drew her gently to a seat beside him, in the recess of a window.\r\nWith a quick glance of his eye towards the Countess, he seemed to imply\r\nthe wish to converse with Helen somewhat apart. So the Countess\r\ninterpreted the glance; and though she remained in the room, she seated\r\nherself at a distance, and bent over a book.\r\n\r\nIt was touching to see how the austere man of business lent himself to\r\ndraw forth the mind of this quiet, shrinking girl; and if you had\r\nlistened, you would have comprehended how he came to possess such social\r\ninfluence, and how well, some time or other in the course of his life, he\r\nhad learned to adapt himself to women. He spoke first of Harley\r\nL’Estrange—spoke with tact and delicacy. Helen at first answered by\r\nmonosyllables, and then, by degrees, with grateful and open affection.\r\nAudley’s brow grew shaded. He then spoke of Italy; and though no man had\r\nless of the poet in his nature, yet, with the dexterity of one long versed\r\nin the world, and who has been accustomed to extract evidences from\r\ncharacters most opposed to his own, he suggested such topics as might\r\nserve to arouse poetry in others. Helen’s replies betrayed a cultivated\r\ntaste, and a charming womanly mind; but they betrayed also one accustomed\r\nto take its colorings from another’s—to appreciate, admire, revere the\r\nLofty and the Beautiful, but humbly and meekly. There was no vivid\r\nenthusiasm, no remark of striking originality, no flash of the\r\nself-kindling, creative faculty. Lastly, Egerton turned to England—to the\r\ncritical nature of the times—to the claims which the country possessed\r\nupon all who had the ability to serve and guide its troubled destinies. He\r\nenlarged warmly on Harley’s natural talents, and rejoiced that he had\r\nreturned to England, perhaps to commence some great career. Helen looked\r\nsurprised, but her face caught no correspondent glow from Audley’s\r\neloquence. He rose, and an expression of disappointment passed over his\r\ngrave, handsome features, and as quickly vanished.\r\n\r\n\"Adieu! my dear Miss Digby; I fear I have wearied you, especially with my\r\npolitics. Adieu, Lady Lansmere; no doubt I shall see Harley as soon as he\r\nreturns.\"\r\n\r\nThen he hastened from the room, gained his carriage, and ordered the\r\ncoachman to drive to Downing-street. He drew down the blinds, and leant\r\nback. A certain languor became visible in his face, and once or twice he\r\nmechanically put his hand to his heart.\r\n\r\n\"She is good, amiable, docile—will make an excellent wife, no doubt,\" said\r\nhe, murmuringly. \"But does she love Harley as he has dreamed of love? No!\r\nHas she the power and energy to arouse his faculties, and restore to the\r\nworld the Harley of old? No! Meant by heaven to be the shadow of another’s\r\nsun—not herself the sun—this child is not the one who can atone for the\r\nPast and illume the Future.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat evening Harley L’Estrange arrived at his father’s house. The few\r\nyears that had passed since we saw him last, had made no perceptible\r\nchange in his appearance. He still preserved his elastic youthfulness of\r\nform, and singular variety and play of countenance. He seemed unaffectedly\r\nrejoiced to greet his parents, and had something of the gayety and the\r\ntenderness of a boy returned from school. His manner to Helen bespoke the\r\nchivalry that pervaded all the complexities and curves of his character.\r\nIt was affectionate but respectful. Hers to him, subdued—but innocently\r\nsweet and gently cordial. Harley was the chief talker. The aspect of the\r\ntimes was so critical, that he could not avoid questions on politics; and,\r\nindeed, he showed an interest in them which he had never evinced before.\r\nLord Lansmere was delighted.\r\n\r\n\"Why, Harley, you love your country, after all?\"\r\n\r\n\"The moment she seems in danger—yes!\" replied the Patrician; and the\r\nSybarite seemed to rise into the Athenian.\r\n\r\nThen he asked with eagerness about his old friend Audley; and, his\r\ncuriosity satisfied there, he inquired the last literary news. He had\r\nheard much of a book lately published. He named the one ascribed by Parson\r\nDale to Professor Moss; none of his listeners had read it. Harley pished\r\nat this, and accused them all of indolence and stupidity in his own\r\nquaint, metaphorical style. Then he said—\"And town gossip?\"\r\n\r\n\"We never hear it,\" said Lady Lansmere.\r\n\r\n\"There is a new plough much talked of at Boodle’s,\" said Lord Lansmere.\r\n\r\n\"God speed it. But is there not a new man much talked of at White’s?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don’t belong to White’s.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nevertheless, you may have heard of him—a foreigner, a Count di\r\nPeschiera.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Lord Lansmere; \"he was pointed out to me in the Park—a\r\nhandsome man for a foreigner; wears his hair properly cut; looks\r\ngentlemanlike and English.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, ah! He is here then!\" And Harley rubbed his hands.\r\n\r\n\"Which road did you take? Did you pass the Simplon?\"\r\n\r\n\"No; I came straight from Vienna.\"\r\n\r\nThen, relating with lively vein his adventures by the way, he continued to\r\ndelight Lord Lansmere by his gayety till the time came to retire to rest.\r\nAs soon as Harley was in his own room, his mother joined him.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said he, \"I need not ask if you like Miss Digby? Who would not?\"\r\n\r\n\"Harley, my own son,\" said the mother, bursting into tears, \"be happy your\r\nown way; only be happy; that is all I ask.\"\r\n\r\nHarley, much affected, replied gratefully and soothingly to this fond\r\ninjunction. And then gradually leading his mother on to converse of Helen,\r\nasked abruptly—\"And of the chance of our happiness—her happiness well as\r\nmine—what is your opinion? Speak frankly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of _her_ happiness, there can be no doubt,\" replied the mother proudly.\r\n\"Of yours, how can you ask me? Have you not decided on that yourself?\"\r\n\r\n\"But still it cheers and encourages one in any experiment, however well\r\nconsidered, to hear the approval of another. Helen has certainly a most\r\ngentle temper.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should conjecture so. But her mind—\"\r\n\r\n\"Is very well stored.\"\r\n\r\n\"She speaks so little—\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. I wonder why? She’s surely a woman!\"\r\n\r\n\"Pshaw,\" said the Countess, smiling in spite of herself. \"But tell me more\r\nof the process of your experiment. You took her as a child, and resolved\r\nto train her according to your own ideal. Was that easy?\"\r\n\r\n\"It seemed so. I desired to instil habits of truth—she was already by\r\nnature truthful as the day; a taste for nature and all things natural—that\r\nseemed inborn: perceptions of Art as the interpreter of Nature—those were\r\nmore difficult to teach. I think they may come. You have heard her play\r\nand sing?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"She will surprise you. She has less talent for drawing; still, all that\r\nteaching could do has been done—in a word, she is accomplished. Temper,\r\nheart, mind—these are all excellent.\" Harley stopped, and suppressed a\r\nsigh. \"Certainly, I ought to be very happy,\" said he; and he began to wind\r\nup his watch.\r\n\r\n\"Of course she must love you?\" said the Countess, after a pause. \"How\r\ncould she fail?\"\r\n\r\n\"Love me! My dear mother, that is the very question I shall have to ask.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ask! Love is discovered by a glance; it has no need of asking.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have never discovered it, then, I assure you. The fact is, that before\r\nher childhood was passed, I removed her, as you may suppose, from my roof.\r\nShe resided with an Italian family, near my usual abode. I visited her\r\noften, directed her studies, watched her improvement—\"\r\n\r\n\"And fell in love with her?\"\r\n\r\n\"Fall is such a very violent word. No; I don’t remember to have had a\r\nfall. It was all a smooth inclined plane from the first step, until at\r\nlast I said to myself, ’Harley L’Estrange, thy time has come. The bud has\r\nblossomed into flower. Take it to thy breast.’ And myself replied to\r\nmyself meekly, ’So be it.’ Then I found that Lady N daughters, was coming\r\nto England. I asked her Ladyship to take my ward to your house. I wrote to\r\nyou, and prayed your assent; and, that granted, I knew you would obtain my\r\nfather’s. I am here—you give me the approval I sought for. I will speak to\r\nHelen to-morrow. Perhaps, after all, she may reject me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Strange, strange—you speak thus coldly, thus lightly; you so capable of\r\nardent love!\"\r\n\r\n\"Mother,\" said Harley, earnestly, \"be satisfied! _I_ am! Love, as of old,\r\nI feel, alas! too well, can visit me never more. But gentle companionship,\r\ntender friendship, the relief and the sunlight of woman’s smile—hereafter\r\nthe voices of children—music that, striking on the hearts of both parents,\r\nwakens the most lasting and the purest of all sympathies: these are my\r\nhope. Is the hope so mean, my fond mother?\"\r\n\r\nAgain the Countess wept, and her tears were not dried when she left the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nOh! Helen, fair Helen—type of the quiet, serene, unnoticed, deep-felt\r\nexcellence of woman! Woman, less as the ideal that a poet conjures from\r\nthe air, than as the companion of a poet on the earth! Woman who, with her\r\nclear sunny vision of things actual, and the exquisite fibre of her\r\ndelicate sense, supplies the deficiencies of him whose foot stumbles on\r\nthe soil, because his eye is too intent upon the stars! Woman, the\r\nprovident, the comforting angel—whose pinions are folded round the heart,\r\nguarding there a divine spring unmarred by the winter of the world! Helen,\r\nsoft Helen, is it indeed in thee that the wild and brilliant \"lord of\r\nwantonness and ease\" is to find the regeneration of his life—the rebaptism\r\nof his soul? Of what avail thy meek prudent household virtues to one whom\r\nFortune screens from rough trial?—whose sorrows lie remote from thy\r\nken?—whose spirit, erratic and perturbed, now rising, now falling, needs a\r\nvision more subtle than thine to pursue, and a strength that can sustain\r\nthe reason, when it droops, on the wings of enthusiasm and passion?\r\n\r\nAnd thou thyself, O nature, shrinking and humble, that needest to be\r\ncourted forth from the shelter, and developed under the calm and genial\r\natmosphere of holy, happy love—can such affection as Harley L’Estrange may\r\nproffer suffice to thee? Will not the blossoms, yet folded in the petal,\r\nwither away beneath the shade that may protect them from the storm, and\r\nyet shut them from the sun? Thou who, where thou givest love, seekest,\r\nthough meekly, for love in return; —to be the soul’s sweet necessity, the\r\nlife’s household partner to him who receives all thy faith and\r\ndevotion—canst thou influence the sources of joy and of sorrow in the\r\nheart that does not heave at thy name? Hast thou the charm and the force\r\nof the moon, that the tides of that wayward sea shall ebb and flow at thy\r\nwill? Yet who shall say—who conjecture how near two hearts may become,\r\nwhen no guilt lies between them, and time brings the ties all its own?\r\nRarest of all things on earth is the union in which both, by their\r\ncontrasts, make harmonious their blending; each supplying the defects of\r\nthe helpmate, and completing, by fusion, one strong human soul! Happiness\r\nenough, where even Peace does but seldom preside, when each can bring to\r\nthe altar, if not, the flame, still the incense. Where man’s thoughts are\r\nall noble and generous, woman’s feelings all gentle and pure, love may\r\nfollow, if it does not precede;—and if not,—if the roses be missed from\r\nthe garland, one may sigh for the rose, but one is safe from the thorn.\r\n\r\nThe morning was mild, yet somewhat overcast by tho mists which announce\r\ncoming winter in London, and Helen walked musingly beneath the trees that\r\nsurrounded the garden of Lord Lansmere’s house. Many leaves were yet left\r\non the boughs; but they were sere and withered. And the birds chirped at\r\ntimes; but their note was mournful and complaining. All within this house,\r\nuntil Harley’s arrival, had been strange and saddening to Helen’s timid\r\nand subdued spirits. Lady Lansmere had received her kindly, but with a\r\ncertain restraint; and the loftiness of manner, common to the Countess\r\nwith all but Harley, had awed and chilled the diffident orphan. Lady\r\nLansmere’s very interest in Harley’s choice—her attempts to draw Helen out\r\nof her reserve—her watchful eyes whenever Helen shyly spoke, or shyly\r\nmoved, frightened the poor child, and made her unjust to herself.\r\n\r\nThe very servants, though staid, grave, and respectful, as suited a\r\ndignified, old-fashioned household, painfully contrasted the bright\r\nwelcoming smiles and free talk of Italian domestics. Her recollections of\r\nthe happy warm Continental manner, which so sets the bashful at their\r\nease, made the stately and cold precision of all around her doubly awful\r\nand dispiriting. Lord Lansmere himself, who did not as yet know the views\r\nof Harley, and little dreamed that he was to anticipate a daughter-in-law\r\nin the ward whom he understood Harley, in a freak of generous romance had\r\nadopted, was familiar and courteous, as became a host. But he looked upon\r\nHelen as a mere child, and naturally left her to the Countess. The dim\r\nsense of her equivocal position—of her comparative humbleness of birth and\r\nfortunes, oppressed and pained her; and even her gratitude to Harley was\r\nmade burthensome by a sentiment of helplessness. The grateful long to\r\nrequite. And what could she ever do for him?\r\n\r\nThus musing, she wandered alone through the curving walks; and this sort\r\nof mock country landscape—London loud, and even visible, beyond the high\r\ngloomy walls, and no escape from the windows of the square formal\r\nhouse—seemed a type of the prison bounds of Rank to one whose soul yearns\r\nfor simple loving Nature.\r\n\r\nHelen’s reverie was interrupted by Nero’s joyous bark. He had caught sight\r\nof her, and came bounding up, and thrust his large head into her hand. As\r\nshe stooped to caress the dog, happy at his honest greeting, and tears\r\nthat had been long gathering to the lids fell silently on his face, (for I\r\nknow nothing that more moves us to tears than the hearty kindness of a\r\ndog, when something in human beings has pained or chilled us,) she heard\r\nbehind the musical voice of Harley. Hastily she dried or repressed her\r\ntears, as her guardian came up, and drew her arm within his own.\r\n\r\n\"I had so little of your conversation last evening, my dear ward, that I\r\nmay well monopolize you now, even to the privation of Nero. And so you are\r\nonce more in your native land?\"\r\n\r\nHelen sighed softly.\r\n\r\n\"May I not hope that you return under fairer auspices than those which\r\nyour childhood knew?\"\r\n\r\nHelen turned her eyes with ingenuous thankfulness to her guardian, and the\r\nmemory of all she owed to him rushed upon her heart. Harley renewed, and\r\nwith earnest though melancholy sweetness—\"Helen, your eyes thank me; but\r\nhear me before your words do. I deserve no thanks. I am about to make to\r\nyou a strange confession of egotism and selfishness.\"\r\n\r\n\"You!—oh, impossible!\"\r\n\r\n\"Judge yourself, and then decide which of us shall have cause to be\r\ngrateful. Helen, when I was scarcely your age—a boy in years, but more,\r\nmethinks, a man at heart, with man’s strong energies and sublime\r\naspirings, than I have ever since been—I loved, and deeply—\" He paused a\r\nmoment in evident struggle. Helen listened in mute surprise, but his\r\nemotion awakened her own; her tender woman’s heart yearned to console.\r\nUnconsciously her arm rested on his less lightly. \"Deeply, and for sorrow.\r\nIt is a long tale, that may be told hereafter. The worldly would call my\r\nlove a madness. I did not reason on it then—I cannot reason on it now.\r\nEnough; death smote suddenly, terribly, and to me mysteriously, her whom I\r\nloved. The love lived on. Fortunately, perhaps, for me, I had quick\r\ndistraction, not to grief, but to its inert indulgence. I was a soldier; I\r\njoined our armies. Men called me brave. Flattery! I was a coward before\r\nthe thought of life. I sought death: like sleep, it does not come at our\r\ncall. Peace ensued. As when the winds fall the sails droop—so when\r\nexcitement ceased, all seemed to me flat and objectless. Heavy, heavy was\r\nmy heart. Perhaps grief had been less obstinate, but that I feared I had\r\ncause for self-reproach. Since then I have been a wanderer—a self-made\r\nexile. My boyhood had been ambitious—all ambition ceased. Flames, when\r\nthey reach the core of the heart, spread, and leave all in ashes. Let me\r\nbe brief: I did not mean thus weakly to complain—I to whom heaven has\r\ngiven so many blessings! I felt, as it were, separated from the common\r\nobjects and joys of men. I grew startled to see how, year by year, wayward\r\nhumors possessed me. I resolved again to attach myself to some living\r\nheart—it was my sole chance to rekindle my own. But the one I had loved\r\nremained as my type of woman, and she was different from all I saw.\r\nTherefore I said to myself, ’I will rear from childhood some young fresh\r\nlife, to grow up into my ideal.’ As this thought began to haunt me, I\r\nchanced to discover you. Struck with the romance of your early life,\r\ntouched by your courage, charmed by your affectionate nature, I said to\r\nmyself, ’Here is what I seek.’ Helen, in assuming the guardianship of your\r\nlife, in all the culture which I have sought to bestow on your docile\r\nchildhood, I repeat, that I have been but the egotist. And now, when you\r\nhave reached that age, when it becomes me to speak, and you to listen—now,\r\nwhen you are under the sacred roof of my own mother—now I ask you, can you\r\naccept this heart, such as wasted years, and griefs too fondly nursed,\r\nhave left it? Can you be, at least, my comforter? Can you aid me to regard\r\nlife as a duty, and recover those aspirations which once soared from the\r\npaltry and miserable confines of our frivolous daily being? Helen, here I\r\nask you, can you be all this, and under the name of—Wife?\"\r\n\r\nIt would be in vain to describe the rapid, varying, indefinable emotions\r\nthat passed through the inexperienced heart of the youthful listener as\r\nHarley thus spoke. He so moved all the springs of amaze, compassion,\r\ntender respect, sympathy, childlike gratitude, that when he paused and\r\ngently took her hand, she remained bewildered, speechless, overpowered.\r\nHarley smiled as he gazed upon her blushing, downcast, expressive face. He\r\nconjectured at once that the idea of such proposals had never crossed her\r\nmind; that she had never contemplated him in the character of a wooer;\r\nnever even sounded her heart as to the nature of such feelings as his\r\nimage had aroused.\r\n\r\n\"My Helen,\" he resumed, with a calm pathos of voice, \"there is some\r\ndisparity of years between us, and perhaps I may not hope henceforth for\r\nthat love which youth gives to the young. Permit me simply to ask, what\r\nyou will frankly answer—Can you have seen in our quiet life abroad, or\r\nunder the roof of our Italian friends, any one you prefer to me?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, indeed, no!\" murmured Helen. \"How could I!—who is like you?\" Then,\r\nwith a sudden effort—for her innate truthfulness took alarm, and her very\r\naffection for Harley, childlike and reverent, made her tremble lest she\r\nshould deceive him—she drew a little aside, and spoke thus: \"Oh, my dear\r\nguardian, noblest of all human beings, at least in my eyes, forgive,\r\nforgive me if I seem ungrateful, hesitating; but I cannot, cannot think of\r\nmyself as worthy of you. I never so lifted my eyes. Your rank, your\r\nposition—\"\r\n\r\n\"Why should they be eternally my curse? Forget them and go on.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is not only they,\" said Helen, almost sobbing, \"though they are much;\r\nbut I your type, your ideal!—I!—impossible! Oh, how can I ever be any\r\nthing even of use, of aid, of comfort to one like you!\"\r\n\r\n\"You can, Helen—you can,\" cried Harley, charmed by such ingenuous modesty.\r\n\"May I not keep this hand?\"\r\n\r\nAnd Helen left her hand in Harley’s, and turned away her face, fairly\r\nweeping. A stately step passed under the wintry trees.\r\n\r\n\"My mother,\" said Harley L’Estrange, looking up, \"I present to you my\r\nfuture wife.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREMINISCENCES OF PRINTERS, AUTHORS, AND BOOKSELLERS IN NEW-YORK.(8)\r\n\r\n\r\nBY JOHN W. FRANCIS, M.D., LL. D.\r\n\r\nWhen the great defender of the Constitution delivered the oration at\r\nBunker Hill, he pointed to the just completed monument and exclaimed,\r\n\"There stands the Orator of the Day.\" In humble imitation of that\r\nsignificant act, I also, in attempting to illustrate the interests and the\r\nmeaning of this occasion, would point you, gentlemen, to the fact of your\r\npresence here to-night—to the union at one banquet of printers, editors,\r\npublishers, authors, and professional men—as the best evidence of the\r\nimportance and attractiveness of the occasion. The art of printing, among\r\nother inestimable blessings, has fused together the most productive\r\nelements of society; it has established a vital relation between intellect\r\nand mechanics, between labor and thought. I see before me in this assembly\r\nthose who have achieved enduring literary fame, and those who are the\r\npresent guides of public opinion. I see them side by side with the men who\r\nhave just put their thoughts and sentiments into a bodily form and\r\ndisseminated them on the wings of the press. The association is not only\r\nappropriate, but it is honorable to his memory who united in his life the\r\nhumblest manual toil and the loftiest flights of genius; who both set up\r\ntypes and drew the lightning from heaven, and combined in his own person\r\nthe practical printer and the scientific philosopher.\r\n\r\nBy your courtesy, gentlemen, I have been invited to say a few words\r\nappropriate to the New York-Typographical Society. It is with unfeigned\r\nreluctance that I assume the task. In this presence I behold so many\r\nbetter qualified for the undertaking than myself, that I am apprehensive I\r\nshall be able neither to do justice to my theme nor satisfy the\r\nexpectations which you in your clemency have anticipated. True it is, that\r\nin my early life I was connected with your fraternity by more immediate\r\nties than at present exist. Circumstances have modified my career, but I\r\nshould prove recreant to the best feelings of my heart, turn ingrate to\r\nthe pleasantest associations of memory, and forget the most efficient\r\ncauses which have favored my journey thus far to mellow years, were I\r\nunmindful of the gratifications I enjoyed while a fellow laborer in your\r\nnoble pursuits. The press is the representative of the intellectual man on\r\nearth; it is the expositor of his cogitative powers; the promulgator of\r\nhis most recondite labors; the strong arm of his support in the defence\r\nand maintenance of his inherent rights as a member of the social compact;\r\nthe vindicator of his claims to the exalted station of one stamped in the\r\nexpress image of God; it is the charter of freedom to ameliorated man in\r\nthe glorious strife of social organization, in the pursuits of life,\r\nliberty, and happiness. Hence I have ever cherished the deepest regard for\r\nthose who have appropriated their time and talents to this vast engine of\r\ncivilization. I have ever looked upon the vocation as holding the\r\nintegrity of our highest privileges on earth; freedom of inquiry, freedom\r\nof utterance, and the vast behests of civil communion, with the kindred of\r\nevery nation, and the tongues of every speech.\r\n\r\nWhen I was a boy of ten years of age, I became acquainted with the\r\nbiography of Franklin. I had purchased at auction a Glasgow edition of his\r\nLife and Essays. I had read _Robinson Crusoe_, _George Barnwell_, _The\r\nHouse That Jack Built_, _Æsop’s Fables_, the duodecimo edition of Morse’s\r\n_Geography_, and other common publications of the times. No work that I\r\nhave perused, from that juvenile period of my existence up to the present\r\nday, has ever yielded the peculiar gratification which Franklin’s memoirs\r\ngave me, and my admiration and reverence for our illustrious sage have\r\nthrough all subsequent inquiry into his actions and services, increased in\r\nintensity, in proportion as I have contemplated his wondrous character and\r\nhis unparalleled achievements. I think I owe something to my mother for\r\nthis happy appreciation of our Franklin. She was by birth a Philadelphian,\r\nand for years, during her residence in Arch street, was favored with\r\nopportunities of again and again beholding Dr. Franklin pass her door, in\r\ncompany with Dr. Rush and Thomas Paine. \"There,\" the children of the\r\nneighborhood would cry out, \"goes Poor Richard, Common Sense, and the\r\nDoctor.\" It is recorded that Franklin furnished many thoughts in the\r\nfamous pamphlet of _Common Sense_, while Paine wrote it, and Rush gave the\r\ntitle. There is something in the hereditary transmission of the moral and\r\nof the physical qualities; yet I have thought that the benevolent schemes\r\nof Rush, the intrepid patriotism of Paine, and the honest maxims of\r\nFranklin—the topics of daily converse in that day—had some influence in\r\nstrengthening the principles which my mother inculcated in her children.\r\n\r\nYou have told me, gentlemen, that you would be gratified with some\r\nreminiscences touching New-York—social, literary, personal—of men and\r\nbooks—all having a bearing, more or less immediate, either on the progress\r\nof human development, or the character of our metropolitan city. I know\r\nnot how to satisfy either you or myself. To do justice to the subject\r\nwould require a different opportunity from the one here enjoyed, and\r\nleisure such as I cannot now command.\r\n\r\nThe locality upon which we are assembled to-night has its associations. We\r\nmeet this evening on the memorable spot in our city’s early topography\r\ndenominated the Bayard Farm—a property once in the possession of the\r\naffluent Bayards, of him who was companion in his strife with Governor\r\nLeisler, and whose death for high treason was the issue of that protracted\r\ncontest. That he fell a martyr to freedom, our friend Charles F. Hoffman\r\nhas ably demonstrated. Within a few doors of this place, on Broadway, very\r\nmany years after, but within my recollection, lived that arch negotiator\r\nin public counsels, Talleyrand, the famous ambassador of France to the\r\nUnited States. He published a small tractate on America, once much read,\r\nand it was he who affirmed that the greatest sight he had ever beheld in\r\nthis country, was the illustrious Hamilton, with his pile of books under\r\nhis arms, proceeding to the court-room in the old City Hall, in order to\r\nobtain a livelihood, by expounding the law, and vindicating the rights of\r\nhis clients.\r\n\r\nHere too is the spot where, some short while after, the antics of the\r\nOsage tribe of Indians were displayed for the admiration of the belles and\r\nbeaux of New-York, and on that occasion my old colleague, Dr. Mitchill,\r\ngave translations into English of their songs and war-whoop sounds, for\r\nthe increased gratification of the literary public of that day, when\r\nIndian literature stood not so high as in these times of Congressional\r\nappropriation, and of Henry Schoolcraft, the faithful and patriotic\r\nexpositor of the red-man’s excellences. I think I am safe in saying, also,\r\nthat near these grounds occurred the execution of Young, a play-actor,\r\nconvicted of murder—a remarkable event in New-York annals, owing to\r\npeculiar circumstances which marked his imprisonment in our old jail, now\r\nconverted into the Hall of Records. There were, about the period to which\r\nI now refer, other occurrences of singular influence in those days.\r\n\r\nCrowther and Levi Weeks were both confined in this debased prison because\r\nof high crimes, and many were incarcerated for debt. There was,\r\nnevertheless, an atmosphere of some intellect immolated within its cells;\r\nand for the first, and I believe the only time in this country, a\r\nnewspaper was issued for some months’ duration from its walls, entitled\r\n_The Prisoner of Hope_. The Wilberforce impulse of that crisis had much to\r\ndo with the movement; and no abolition paper of even later dates plead\r\nmore earnestly in behalf of enslaved humanity, by graphic illustrations\r\nand literary talent, than did _The Prisoner of Hope_. At that day, many\r\nnewspapers had their specific motto, and that of _The Prisoner of Hope_\r\nwas in these words:\r\n\r\n  Soft, smiling Hope—thou anchor of the mind;\r\n  The only comfort that the wretched find;\r\n  All look to thee when sorrow wrings the heart,\r\n  To heal, by future prospect, present smart.\r\n\r\nNaturalists tell us that this eligible site was once characterized by the\r\ngraceful foliage of the pride of the American forests, the lofty\r\nplane-tree, the _platanus occidentalis_. It must further increase our\r\ninterest in the spot, to be assured that through its shades strolled our\r\nFranklin, in company with that lover of rural scenery, the botanist\r\nKalm—an occurrence not unlike the interesting one of the excursions of\r\nLinnæus with Hans Sloane, in the Royal Gardens, near London. Here, too,\r\nthe wild pigeon was taken in great abundance; while in the Common (now\r\nPark) those primitive inhabitants of the city, the Beekman family, with\r\nthe old doctor at their head, shot deer and other game in their field\r\nsports. But enough at present of the locality where this anniversary is\r\nheld.\r\n\r\nThe history of the American periodical press, if given with any thing like\r\nfidelity and minuteness, would occupy several hours; it is a noble\r\nspecimen of our triumphs as a free people, and of our determination so to\r\nremain; it has demonstrated the progress of knowledge, and the intrepidity\r\nof New-Yorkers, as much as any one series of facts or occurrences we could\r\nsummon for illustration. Everybody within this hall is aware that William\r\nBradford was the first in time of the newspaper publishers of New-York.\r\nHis gazette made its earliest appearance in October, 1725, four years\r\nafter James, the brother of Benjamin Franklin, began the _New England\r\nCourant_—this being seventeen years after the commencement of the _Boston\r\nNews Letter_, the first regular newspaper commenced in North America. I\r\nadvert to this circumstance because we possess the completed file of that\r\nearliest of the journals of our land now in existence. The copy in the\r\nlibrary of the Massachusetts Historical Society was presented that\r\ninstitution by the famous antiquary, Dr. Eliot; that in our own Historical\r\nSociety is the file which was preserved by Professor McKean, of Harvard\r\nUniversity, who bequeathed it to the Rev. T. Alden, from whom I purchased\r\nit and deposited it where it now remains.\r\n\r\nFrom Franklin’s representations, Bradford was a sorry individual, of low\r\ncunning, and sinister; yet I must not deal harshly with him. His, I\r\nbelieve, was the first printing press set up in New-York: he published the\r\nlaws, and other state papers, and he was the grandfather of Bradford,\r\nafterwards Attorney-General of the United States; and as from his loins\r\nproceeded Thomas Bradford, the adventurous and patriotic publisher of\r\nRees’s _Cyclopædia_—the most enterprising of the craft, and our greatest\r\npatron of engravers—I desire to hold him in grateful memory. Our second\r\nnewspaper was the _New-York Weekly Journal_, commenced about three years\r\nafter Bradford’s. John Peter Zenger, its proprietor, was a German by\r\nbirth, a palatine, and something of a scholar; a man of enlarged\r\nliberality, patriotic, and an advocate of popular rights. He attacked the\r\nmeasures of the provincial Governor and Council, was subjected to a\r\nprosecution by the officers of the crown, and was brought to trial in\r\n1735, when Andrew Hamilton, the Recorder of Philadelphia, came to this\r\ncity and successfully defended him. I have before stated that the late\r\nillustrious Governor Morris considered the decision of that case in behalf\r\nof the press as the dawn of that liberty which subsequently revolutionized\r\nAmerica. To the ladies now present, the lovers of sweet sounds, it may not\r\nbe uninteresting to know that the first piano forte (harpsichord) imported\r\ninto America, arrived in this city for the musical gratification of the\r\nfamily of the noble Zenger.\r\n\r\nBut I can say at this time little concerning newspapers. Our worthy\r\nassociate in good works, Edwin Williams, has lately issued a memoir of\r\nmuch value on the subject, to which I must refer you. I regret that his\r\ncatalogue of early journals is somewhat defective. As he justly observes,\r\nour Historical Society is wonderfully rich in these interesting documents.\r\nOur most precious treasures in that way are, unquestionably, the Rivington\r\n_Royal Gazette_, the old _New-York Daily Advertiser_, containing debates\r\non the State Constitution, the _American Citizen and Republican Watch\r\nTower_, the _New-York Evening Post_, and the _Commercial Advertiser_,\r\nthrough a long series, the _New-York American_, the _Independent\r\nReflector_, containing the patriotic Essays on Toleration, by William\r\nLivingston, of New Jersey, and the _Time-Piece of New-York_, replete with\r\ninvective against the Washington Administration—whose editor, Philip\r\nFreneau, verbally assured me that its most vituperative features were from\r\nsuggestions of Jefferson, during the crisis in our public affairs provoked\r\nby Citizen Genet. But I must hasten to other topics.\r\n\r\nAmong the most conspicuous editors and publishers of gazettes whom I have\r\npersonally known was Noah Webster, now so famous for his Dictionary. At\r\nthe time I knew him, some forty years ago, he was in person somewhat above\r\nthe ordinary height, slender, with gray eyes, and a keen aspect;\r\nremarkable for neatness in dress, and characterized by an erect walk, a\r\nbroad hat, and a long cue, much after the manner of Albert Gallatin, as\r\ndepicted in the engraving in Callender’s _Prospect Before Us_. If with\r\nphilologists he is deemed a man of merit, it may with equal justice be\r\nsaid that he is to be recognized by medical men as an author of\r\nimportance, for his _History of Pestilence_.\r\n\r\nNext I may note William Coleman, usually called in earlier days, by his\r\nantagonist Cheetham, Field-Marshal Coleman. Mr. Bryant, the able editor of\r\nthe _Post_, in his biography of the first fifty years of that prominent\r\ngazette, has well described him. He was a sensitive man, of great tenacity\r\nof opinion, which he cherished by intercourse with many of the leading\r\npatriots and politicians who were among us some thirty years ago. He\r\nalmost leaned on the arm of the inflexible Timothy Pickering, and had, in\r\nhis younger days, held communion with Hamilton, John Wells and Rufus King.\r\nI shall never forget how the death of the immortal Hamilton subdued his\r\nfeeling. When Gouverneur Morris delivered his felicitous eulogy from the\r\nportals of old Trinity Church, over the dead body of the noble martyr,\r\nwith grief in every countenance, and anguish in every heart, Coleman’s\r\nacuteness of feeling paralyzed every movement of his frame, and drowned\r\nevery faculty of his mind. While on this topic, the decease of Hamilton, I\r\nmay state an anecdote, the import of which can be readily understood. It\r\nwas not long prior to the time of his death that the new and authentic\r\nedition of _The Federalist_ was published by George F. Hopkins. Hopkins\r\ntold me of the delicacy with which Hamilton listened to his proposition to\r\nprint a new edition of these papers. \"They are demanded by the spirit of\r\nthe times and the desire of the people,\" said Hopkins. \"Do you really\r\nthink, Mr. Hopkins, that those fugitive essays will be read, if\r\nreprinted?\" asked Hamilton; \"well, give me a few days to consider,\" said\r\nhe. \"Will this not be a good opportunity, Gen. Hamilton,\" rejoined\r\nHopkins, \"to revise them, and, if so, to make, perhaps, alterations, if\r\nnecessary, in some parts?\" \"No, sir, if reprinted, they must stand exactly\r\nas at first, not a word of alteration. A comma may be inserted or left\r\nout, but the work must undergo no change whatever.\"\r\n\r\nA few days had elapsed when, on the next interview, General Hamilton\r\nagreed to the reprint, with the express condition that he himself must\r\ninspect the revised proofs. Not a word was ever altered. \"You think\r\nsomething of the papers?\" says Hamilton to the printer. \"Mr. Hopkins, let\r\nthem be issued. Heretofore, sir, I have given the people common milk;\r\nhereafter, shortly, sir, I shall give them strong meat.\" What the Union\r\nlost by that fatal duel, the Deity only knows.\r\n\r\nColeman was a writer of grammatical excellence, though occasionally sadly\r\nat fault in force of diction. Under the influence of some perverse\r\nconceits, he would labor for months to establish a theoretical doctrine,\r\nor to elucidate a useless proposition. It was hardly in the power of\r\nmortals ever to alter his opinions when once formed. That yellow fever was\r\nas contagious as small-pox; that skull-cap (the _scutellaria_) was a\r\nspecific for hydrophobia; that Napoleon wanted the requisites of a\r\nmilitary chieftain, were among the crotchets of his brain. The everlasting\r\ntractates which he put forth on these and other subjects, would in the\r\npresent day of editorial prowess scarcely be tolerated in a chronicle\r\ndepending on public patronage. Coleman had read extensively on medical\r\ntopics, and was the principal writer of that able and elaborate Criticism\r\nof Miller’s Report on the Yellow Fever in New-York, addressed to Governor\r\nLewis, and printed in the second volume of the _American Medical and\r\nPhilosophical Register_.\r\n\r\nColeman would underrate the best public services, if rendered by a\r\npolitical opponent. Chancellor Livingston found no quarters with him for\r\nhis instrumentality in the Louisiana purchase. He would ride a hobby to\r\ndeath. During the many years in which I read the _Post_, I can summon to\r\nrecollection no contributions on any subject, made to that paper, that\r\never awakened one half the attention which was enlisted by the felicitous\r\nproductions of our poet Halleck, and the lamented Dr. Drake, under the\r\nnames of Croaker, and Croaker & Co.\r\n\r\nFor numerous years I have well known Charles Holt, once editor of the\r\n_Bee_, during John Adams’s administration, and afterwards of the New-York\r\n_Columbian_, during Dewitt Clinton’s gubernatorial career. I am unable to\r\ntell you whether he is still among the living. I would estimate his age,\r\nif so, as approaching ninety years. He was a lump of benevolence, and a\r\nstrenuous advocate of the great internal improvement policy of New-York.\r\nHe comes forcibly to my mind this evening, because in 1798 he wrote a\r\nhistory of the yellow fever in New London, and every now and then I find\r\nhim quoted in medical books as Dr. Holt, just as his predecessor, who\r\nwrote on the yellow fever in Philadelphia, of 1793, stands in bold relief\r\nas Dr. Matthew Carey.\r\n\r\nNathaniel Carter is vividly impressed on my recollection; he had very\r\nconsiderable literary taste; was many years editor of the New-York\r\n_Statesman_; and after his visit to Europe, published his _Letters_ on his\r\ntour, in two large volumes. His merit was only equalled by his modesty. He\r\nwas strongly devoted to Dewitt Clinton and the Erie Canal; with becoming\r\ntenacity he cherished much regard for his eastern brethren, and was the\r\nfirst I think who introduced his personal friend, our constitutional\r\nexpositor, Daniel Webster, to the Bread and Cheese Lunch, founded by J.\r\nFenimore Cooper, at which sometimes met, in familiar discussions, such\r\nminds as those of Chief Justice Jones, Peter A. Jay, Henry Storrs,\r\nProfessor Renwick, John Anthon, Charles King, John Duer, and others of\r\nlike intellectual calibre. Carter was of a feeble frame, struggling with\r\npulmonary annoyance, from which he died early. He was little initiated in\r\nthe trickery of political controversy. His heart was filled with the\r\nkindliest feelings of which nature is susceptible.\r\n\r\nMy acquaintance with the late Colonel Stone, so long connected with the\r\n_Commercial Advertiser_, commenced while he was the efficient editor of\r\nthe _Albany Daily Advertiser_. His devotion to the best interests of the\r\nstate and country; his extensive knowledge of American history; his\r\npatriotic feeling evinced on all occasions in behalf of our injured\r\nAborigines; his biographies of Red Jacket and Brandt; his great political\r\nconsistency during so many years—all commend him to our kindest and most\r\ngrateful recollections. That he was cut off at a comparatively early age,\r\nwas the result of his severe and unremitting literary toils. With a\r\ntouching patience, he endured an agonizing illness, nor did he cease his\r\nuseful labors till exhausted nature forbade further efforts.\r\n\r\nAbout the time of the death of Colonel Stone, New-York lost a valuable\r\npromoter of its substantial interests by the demise of John Pintard. His\r\ncareer is still fresh in the memories of those who cherish the actions of\r\nthe benevolent and humane. He was a native of this city (born in 1759),\r\nwhere he passed the greater part of his life, and died in 1844, in his\r\neighty-sixth year. He was connected with the newspaper press in the\r\nearlier times of the _Daily Advertiser_. Pintard was well acquainted with\r\nnearly all the distinguished public characters at the period of the\r\nadoption of our constitution. Possessed of sound attainments by his\r\nPrinceton College education, the ardor of his patriotism displayed itself\r\nby his uniting with a body of his college companions, in a military\r\nmovement, in the revolutionary contest. He afterwards returned for a while\r\nto his _alma mater_, with the approbation of President Witherspoon. He was\r\nnext appointed a sub-commissioner for American prisoners in New-York, and\r\nhad frequent intercourse with the notorious Cunningham, the keeper of the\r\nProvost; visited the Sugar House, occupied by the unfortunate prisoners of\r\nwar, in Crown street (now Liberty street); the Dutch Church in Nassau\r\nstreet, the Scotch Church in Little Queen street (now Cedar street), and\r\nalso the Friends’ Meeting House in Queen street (now Pearl street), near\r\nCherry street, all tilled with the wretched victims of tyranny. He\r\ninterceded in their behalf with the German General Heister, and with Henry\r\nClinton, the British commander. He became acquainted with Knyphausen,\r\nWilliam Smith the historian of New-York, Lord Howe, and others, and he has\r\ndescribed, as an eye-witness, the scenes occurring at Washington’s\r\ninauguration, in 1789. He was an advocate of the Federal policy of that\r\nday, and was a member of our State Legislature when it held its sessions\r\nin this city. Time forbids my detailing the objects to which he directed\r\nhis attention during a long career of usefulness. Several of our important\r\nmunicipal regulations still in force were suggested by him. He was an\r\nearnest champion and successful advocate for the incorporation of the Bank\r\nof New-York. He was one of the founders of the Tammany Society, in those\r\ndays made up of gentlemen of all political parties, and the express object\r\nof which was to preserve the history and habits of our red brethren. He\r\nurged the plan of a Registry of Mortality in this city, and was appointed\r\nthe first City Inspector. The New-York Historical Society must look upon\r\nhim as its chief founder. Some of its most precious treasures are fruits\r\nof his munificence. He was among the most strenuous, with Bishop Hobart,\r\nin establishing and increasing the library of the Protestant Episcopal\r\nSeminary, and was not deficient of contributions towards it. He was active\r\nwith Elias Boudinot in projecting the American Bible Society. The first\r\nBank of Savings mainly originated with him. He revived the Chamber of\r\nCommerce after its long repose. He convened the first assemblage of our\r\ncitizens at the Park; for the purpose of obtaining a public expression of\r\nopinion in favor of the Canal policy for connecting the Erie and the\r\nHudson, and this at a period when the spirit of party strife had widely\r\nscattered doubts and ridicule on the contemplated movement. In the war of\r\n1812, when paper money in small bills largely became our currency, Mr.\r\nPintard was the person who caused those well-known mottoes, \"Mind your own\r\nbusiness,\" \"Never despair,\" \"Economy is wealth,\" and others of a like\r\nimport, chiefly drawn from Franklin, to surround the designations of the\r\nvalue of the money. He had, I believe, done a like service in our\r\nrevolutionary times. He carried the measure of having the British names of\r\nour streets changed to the modern ones they are now known by. I have\r\nnoticed these few circumstances concerning him, because I wish it to be\r\nimpressed on your memories that the editors and proprietors of public\r\njournals are often zealous in good measures not necessarily connected with\r\ntheir immediate vocation. Pintard enjoyed an intimacy with booksellers and\r\nauthors. He and Freneau, a native also of this city, and his contemporary,\r\nhad often been in close communion, as patriots of the revolution. This\r\nessential difference, however, obtained between them. Pintard was a\r\nfederalist; Freneau an antifederalist. Old Rivington had often a hard time\r\nwith them. The sordid tory could neither endure the conservative\r\nrepublican principles of Pintard, nor the relentless bitterness of the\r\nsarcasm of Freneau. I shall only add that he was a student of many books,\r\nand an observer of men in every walk of life. He was of grave thought, yet\r\noften facetious in conversation. During forty years of medical practice, I\r\nhave rarely fell in with one richer in table-talk, or better supplied with\r\ntopics in life and letters. In his death, he manifested the strength of\r\nhis religious faith, and resigned his spirit with a benignant composure.\r\nBut I am forbidden to enlarge on the many excellences and services of the\r\npublic-spirited John Pintard.\r\n\r\nWere we to dwell upon the excellence of a gazette according to its merits,\r\nI should have much to say of the _Morning Chronicle_, a paper established\r\nin this city in the year 1802. The leading editor was Dr. Peter Irving, a\r\ngentleman of refined address, scholastic attainments, and elegant\r\nerudition. It exhibited great power in its editorial capacity, and was the\r\nvehicle of much literary matter from the abundance and ability of its\r\ncorrespondence. If I do not greatly err, in this paper Washington Irving\r\nfirst appeared as an author, by his series of dramatic criticisms, over\r\nthe signature of Jonathan Oldstyle. The only poetic writer of whose\r\neffusions I now retain any recollection was Miss Smith, the sister of the\r\nlate Thomas E. Smith. Her pieces were known by the signature of Clara; and\r\nin bringing together the effusions of the early female poets, Dr.\r\nGriswold, in his praiseworthy zeal in behalf of American literature, might\r\nwell have increased in value his interesting collection by specimens of\r\nthe productions of Miss Smith.\r\n\r\nThe omission, in these reminiscences, of some notice of John Lang, would\r\nbe so quickly discovered, that I am necessarily compelled to dwell for a\r\nmoment on the character and services of one who, for a long succession of\r\nyears, filled a notable place in our newspaper annals. Lang was of Scotch\r\ndescent, but the place of his birth, I believe, was New-York. For some\r\nforty or more years, Lang’s _Gazette_ was recognized as the leading\r\nmercantile advertiser, and the patronage which it received from the\r\nbusiness world was such as doubtless secured ample returns to its\r\nproprietor. The distinction of the paper was unquestionably its attention\r\nto the shipping interests of this commercial emporium. As a journal of\r\neither political or miscellaneous matter it was sadly deficient. Lang\r\nadhered to his \"arrivals\" as the prominent object of consideration, and\r\nthe mightiest changes of revolutions, in actions or opinions, found but a\r\nstinted record in his widely-diffused journal. Rarely, indeed, did our\r\nacknowledged politicians or essayists seek its columns for the\r\npromulgation of their ideas, and its editorial displays were generally\r\ntormentingly feeble. Nevertheless, it was in this gazette, then under the\r\ncontrol of Lang and McLean, that General Hamilton first gave to the public\r\nhis numbers of _The Federalist_. There is often to be found in one daily\r\nissue of the _Post_, the _Courier and Enquirer_, the _Journal of\r\nCommerce_, the _Herald_, the _Tribune_, or the _Times_ of these days, more\r\nthought, nice disquisition, and real knowledge which awakens the\r\ncontemplation of the statesman and politician, than the _New-York Gazette_\r\ncontained during a twelvemonth; and yet it flourished. The traits of\r\nLang’s character were unwavering devotion to his pursuits; no one could\r\nexcel him in the kindness of his demeanor; unconscious of the penury of\r\nhis intellectual powers, he at times, unwittingly became the pliant agent\r\nof designing individuals, and from the blunders into which he was led, his\r\nbaptismal name, John, seemed easily converted into that of Solomon, by\r\nwhich specification much of his correspondence was maintained. He bore the\r\npleasantry with grateful composure.\r\n\r\nWith a characteristic anecdote I must dismiss the name of Lang. The\r\ndiscussions of a point in chronology, which occurred on the commencement\r\nof the present century, awakened some attention with mathematicians and\r\nastronomers abroad, and among many with us. The learned and pious Dr.\r\nKunze, after much investigation, addressed a communication on the vexed\r\nquestion to Mr. Lang. He had adverted to the Gregorian style in his\r\nletter, and had mentioned Pope Gregory. The faithful _Gazette_ printed the\r\narticle Tom Gregory: the venerable Doctor hastened to his friend, and\r\nremonstrated on the injury he had done him, and requested the _erratum_ to\r\nspecify, instead of Tom Gregory, Pope Gregory XIII. Again an alteration\r\nwas made, and the _Gazette_ requested its readers, for Tom Gregory to read\r\nPope Tom Gregory XIII. Only one more attempt at correction was made, when\r\nthe compositor had its typography so changed that it read Tom Gregory, the\r\nPope. The learned divine, with a heavy heart, in a final interview with\r\nthe erudite editor, begged him to make no further improvements, as he\r\ndreaded the loss of all the reputation his years of devotion to the\r\nsubject had secured to him. This Dr. Kunze was long a prominent minister\r\nof the German Lutheran Church of this city. He was the preceptor in\r\nPhiladelphia of Henry Stuber, author of the continuation of the life of\r\nour Socrates, Dr. Franklin: a work executed with much ability. He was a\r\nphysician, and a most delectable character. Many years ago, I was so\r\nfortunate as to procure some materials for a biography of him, and Dr.\r\nSparks has courteously given them a place in his invaluable edition of Dr.\r\nFranklin’s works. Justice to the departed Lang demands that I should add\r\nthat he was a gentleman of the old school, of great moral excellence, and\r\nas a husband and a father most exemplary; deeply devoted to the interests\r\nof this city, and evincing a philanthropic spirit on every becoming\r\noccasion. He died at an advanced age; but his career was shortened by the\r\ngreat fire, in this city, in 1835. That vast destruction in his beloved\r\nNew-York was an oppressive weight upon his heart.\r\n\r\nMajor Noah has so recently departed from among us, and the expectation\r\nthat his active life will soon find a biographer is so general, that it\r\nseems unnecessary on the present occasion to speak at any length\r\nconcerning him. I knew him well some thirty-five years. In religion a Jew,\r\nhe was tolerant of all creeds, with equal amenity; his natural parts were\r\nof a remarkable order; few excelled him in industry, none in temperance\r\nand sobriety. He wrote for many journals, and established several. By his\r\n_Travels in Africa_ he became known as an author. His work on the\r\n_Abolition of Imprisonment for Debt_ was widely read. He was lively in\r\nconverse, and a most social companion. His literary compositions, though\r\nnot always pure in style, often showed a nice sense of the ludicrous and a\r\nlove of humor. He abounded in anecdote. Mr. Matthews, from his personal\r\nknowledge, has not overdrawn the character of Noah. He possessed the organ\r\nof benevolence on a large scale. It is to be regretted that by his\r\npolitical vacillations his talents finally lost all influence in public\r\ncouncils and affairs.\r\n\r\nWe are susceptible of the pleasures and the pains of memory. A retrospect\r\nwill confirm this declaration on many occasions. It is so in our\r\ncontemplations of a newspaper; and in no instance have I been more\r\nsensible of this than when considering the origin, the career, and the\r\ntermination of the _New-York American_. Its prominent projector was\r\nJohnson Verplanck, a native of this city, of a conspicuous family, whose\r\nmental qualities were of a robust order, and whose classical attainments\r\nentitled him to distinction. With the countenance and assistance of\r\nenlightened associates, he soon acquired for the _American_ a reputation\r\nfor eminent talents, great independence in opinion, and the most perfect\r\nfreedom in scrutinizing public acts, and in literary and artistic\r\ncriticism. Mr. Verplanck was one of the writers of the _Buck Tail Bards_,\r\na satirical poem, of Hudibrastic flavor. He died in 1829. The _American_\r\nfell then into other hands, and for a long succession of years was\r\neditorially sustained by one who had often previously enriched its columns\r\nwith his lucubrations. I allude to Charles King, now President of Columbia\r\nCollege. It was soon demonstrated to the satisfaction of its patrons,\r\nthat, although under a new government, and its supplies derived from\r\nanother source, its nutrition was not less wholesome and productive. For\r\nmany years it claimed the admiration of the conservators of constitutional\r\nright and of critical taste. It was conducted with a manly boldness. Its\r\ntone gave dignity to political disquisition, though its manner was\r\nsometimes dreaded by objects of its animadversion: if its censures were\r\noccasionally severe, its approbation was the more highly appreciated: it\r\nwas a record of historical value; nor can I comprehend why, in this age of\r\nuniversal reading in journalism, its career was closed. Its many volumes\r\nmust hereafter be ranked with the once famous _National Gazette_ of Robert\r\nWalsh, and the _National Intelligencer_ of Gales & Seaton. Its\r\ndistinguished editor, satisfied that for so long a period he had performed\r\nhis part in the promotion of sound principles, with singleness of purpose,\r\nin behalf of the city, the state and the nation, may have sought that\r\nrelief from mental care which is often secured by change of occupation.\r\nWhen I cast a thought over the hours I have spent in reading the\r\n_American_, I feel as Whitfield has expressed himself on a different\r\noccasion, \"I am glad, but I am sorry;\" glad that I have had so long the\r\npleasure of being informed by its perusal; sorry that the opportunity no\r\nlonger exists.\r\n\r\nIn closing this short list of editors, I feel justified in deviating for a\r\nmoment in my chronology by a word or two on the character and death of one\r\nwhom I have ever considered the ablest writer we have had in our public\r\njournals. He has been already incidentally mentioned. I allude to James\r\nCheetham. He succeeded as editor of Greenleaf’s paper, calling it the\r\n_American Citizen_. Cheetham was an English radical; had left Manchester\r\nfor this country, and was by trade a hatter. His personal appearance was\r\nimpressive; tall, athletic, with a martial bearing in his walk, a forehead\r\nof great breadth and dimensions, and penetrating gray eyes, he seemed\r\nauthoritative wherever he might be. He arrived in this country at a period\r\nof perplexing excitement in the times of Adams’s administration and\r\nJefferson’s entrance into the presidency. He found many to countenance his\r\nradicalism, as Tennis Wortman, James Dennison, Charles Christian and\r\nothers—men whom we might call liberals, both in religion and in politics.\r\nAccidental circumstances made me well acquainted with him, so early as the\r\nsummer of 1803. He was then universally known as the champion of\r\nJefferson, of Governor George Clinton, and of De Witt Clinton. He was a\r\nmost unflinching partisan writer, and with earnestness asserted the\r\nadvantages arising from the possession of Louisiana, countenanced Blind\r\nPalmer, the lecturer on Deism, and congratulated the public on the return\r\nto America of Thomas Paine. He ever remained an active advocate of old\r\nGeorge Clinton, but his friendship was suddenly turned into hatred of\r\nPaine, and his life of that once prominent but wretched individual\r\ndemonstrates the rancor of his temper. The murderous death of Hamilton, I\r\nthink, had a strong influence on him. No sooner had he breathed his last\r\nthan Cheetham extolled him as the greatest of patriots. Many speak of\r\nCheetham as at times holding the pen of Junius—a judgment sustained by\r\nsome of his political assaults and essays. He possessed a magnificent\r\nlibrary, was a great reader, and studied Burke and Shakspeare more than\r\nany other authors. I know nothing against his moral character. His death,\r\nhowever, was most remarkable: he had removed with his family to a country\r\nresidence, some three miles from the city, in the summer of 1809. A few\r\ndays afterwards he exposed himself to malaria, by walking without a hat,\r\nthrough the fields, under a burning September sun. He was struck with a\r\ncomplication of ills—fever, congestion of the brain, and great cerebral\r\ndistress. The malignancy of his case soon foretold to his physician, Dr.\r\nHosack, the uncertainty of his recovery. Being at that time a student of\r\nmedicine, I was requested to watch him; on the second day of his sickness,\r\nhis fever raging higher, he betrayed a disturbed intellect. On the night\r\nof the third day raving mania set in. Incoherently he called his family\r\naround him, and addressed his sons as to their peculiar avocations for\r\nlife, giving advice to one ever to be temperate in all things, and to\r\nanother urging the importance of knowledge. After midnight he became much\r\nworse, and was ungovernable. With herculean strength he now raised himself\r\nfrom his pillow; with eyes of meteoric fierceness, he grasped his bed\r\ncovering, and in a most vehement but rapid articulation, exclaimed to his\r\nsons, \"Boys! study Bolingbroke for style, and Locke for sentiment.\" He\r\nspoke no more. In a moment life had departed. His funeral was a solemn\r\nmourning of his political friends.\r\n\r\nPaine has been referred too. I have often seen him at the different places\r\nof his residence in this city, now in Partition-street, now in\r\nBroome-street, &c. His localities were not always the most agreeable. In\r\nPartition-street, near the market, a portion of his tenement was occupied\r\nfor the display of wild beasts. Paine generally sat, taking an airing, at\r\nthe lower front windows, the gazed-at of all passers by. Jarvis, the\r\npainter, was often his visitor, and was fortunate enough to secure that\r\ninimitable plaster cast of his head and features, which at his request, I\r\ndeposited with the New-York Historical Society. While at that work, Jarvis\r\nexclaimed, \"I shall secure him to a nicety, if I am so fortunate as to get\r\nplaster enough for his carbuncled nose.\" Jarvis thought this bust of Paine\r\nhis most successful undertaking as a sculptor.\r\n\r\nI shall trespass some moments by giving a few reminiscences concerning\r\nbooksellers and publishers. There are many of this professional order,\r\nwhose character and influence might justly demand a detailed account.\r\nSpence himself would find among them anecdotes worthy consideration in the\r\nworld of letters. I must, however, write within circumscribed limits. The\r\nfirst in my immediate recollection is Everet Duyckinck. He was a\r\nmiddle-aged man, when I, a boy, was occasionally at his store, an ample\r\nand old-fashioned building, at the corner of Pearl-street and Old Slip. He\r\nwas grave in his demeanor, and somewhat taciturn; of great simplicity in\r\ndress; accommodating and courteous. He must have been rich in literary\r\nrecollections. He for a long while occupied his excellent stand for\r\nbusiness, and was quite extensively engaged as a publisher and seller. He\r\nwas a sort of Mr. Newbury, so precious to juvenile memories in the olden\r\ntimes. He largely dealt with that order of books, for elementary\r\ninstruction, which were popular abroad, just about the close of our\r\nrevolutionary war and at the adoption of our Constitution—Old Dyche, and\r\nhis pupil Dilworth, and Perry, and Sheridan. As education and literature\r\nadvanced, he brought forward, by reprints, Johnson and Chesterfield, and\r\nVicissimus Knox, and a host of others. His store was the nucleus of the\r\nConnecticut teachers and intellectual products, and Barlow and Webster,\r\nand Morse and Riggs, found in him a patron of their works in poetry and\r\ntheir school books. Bunyan, Young, Watts, Doddridge and Baxter, must have\r\nbeen issued by his enterprise in innumerable thousands throughout the old\r\nthirteen States; and the _English Primer_, now improved into the _American\r\nPrimer_, with its captivating emendations, as\r\n\r\n  The royal oak, it was the tree\r\n  That saved his Royal Majesty;\r\n\r\nchanged to the more simple couplet—\r\n\r\n  Oak’s not as good\r\n  As hickory wood;\r\n\r\nand the lines—\r\n\r\n  Whales in the sea\r\n  God’s voice obey;\r\n\r\nnow modified without loss of its poetic fire—\r\n\r\n  By Washington,\r\n  Great deeds were done—\r\n\r\nled captivity captive, and had an unlimited circulation, for the better\r\ndiffusion of knowledge and patriotism throughout the land. As our city\r\ngrew apace, and both instructors and their functions enlarged, he engaged\r\nin the Latin classics. Having a little Latin about me, it became my duty\r\nto set up at the printing office of Lewis Nicholls, Duyckinck’s reprint of\r\n_De Bello Gallico_. The edition was edited by a Mr. Rudd. He was the first\r\neditor I ever saw; I looked on him with school-boy admiration when I took\r\nhim the proofs. What alterations or improvements he made in the text of\r\nOudendorp, I never ascertained. This, however, must have been among the\r\nbeginnings of that American practice, still prevailing among us, of having\r\nin reprints of even the most important works from abroad, for better\r\ncirculation, the name of some one as editor, inserted on the title-page.\r\nMr. Duyckinck was gifted with great business talents, and estimated as a\r\nman of punctuality and of rigid integrity in fiscal matters. He was the\r\nfirst who had the entire Bible, in duodecimo, preserved—set up in\r\nforms—the better to supply, at all times, his patrons. This was before\r\nstereotype plates were adopted. He gave to the Harpers the first job of\r\nprinting they executed—whether Tom Thumb or Wesley’s Primitive Physic, I\r\ndo not know. The acorn has become the pride of the forest—the Cliff-street\r\ntree, whose roots and branches now ramify all the land. Duyckinck\r\nfaithfully carried out the proverbs of Franklin, and the sayings of Noah\r\nWebster’s _Prompter_. He was by birth and action a genuine Knickerbocker.\r\n\r\nThere was, about forty years ago, an individual somewhat remarkable in\r\nseveral respects, whose bookstore was in Maiden Lane—William Barlas. He\r\nwas by birth a Scotchman, and was brought up to the ministry; but from\r\ncauses which I never learned, he relinquished that vocation in his native\r\nland, and assumed that of a bookseller in this city. He was reputed to be\r\na ripe scholar. He dealt almost exclusively in the classics, and for\r\nnumerous years imported the editions—_in usum Delphini_, for the students\r\nin our schools and colleges. Hardly a graduate among us, of the olden\r\ntime, can have forgotten him—Irving, Verplanck, John Anthon, and Paulding,\r\ncan doubtless tell much of him. When, on a large scale, was commenced in\r\nPhiladelphia, reprints of the Latin and Greek writers, poor Mr. Barlas’s\r\nfunctions were nearly annihilated. I mention him here from his relation to\r\nthe advancement of learning in my juvenile days. His opinion on the\r\nvarious editions was deemed conclusive; and he controlled the judgment as\r\nwell as the pocket of the purchaser. He was long in epistolary\r\ncorrespondence with \"the friend of Cowper,\" as some call him—old John\r\nNewton of London; and I have often wondered that no enterprise has yet\r\nbrought forward, in a new edition of the writings of Newton, their\r\ncorrespondence. It is not for me to dwell on the contrast, so striking,\r\nbetween the present period and that to which I have just adverted, when\r\neven professors of Colleges were controlled in their opinions of books by\r\nthe dicta of a bookseller. Such was the fact some forty or fifty years\r\nago. What would be the reply of our Professor Anthon, of Columbia College,\r\nto a bookseller who assumed such authority? of him whose love and devotion\r\nto the philosophy of the classics has led him already in so many works to\r\nspread before the cogitative scholars, of both worlds, the deepest\r\nresearches of antiquarian disquisition and philological lore, evincing\r\nthat America is not tardy in a just appreciation of the excellencies of\r\nthose treasures which enriched a Bentley, a Horseley, a Porson, and a\r\nParr.\r\n\r\nThose of our literary connoisseurs who cast a retrospective glance over\r\ndays long past, may awaken into memory that delicately constructed and\r\npensive-looking man, of Pearl-street, recognized by the name of Charles\r\nSmith. I believe he was a New-Yorker. Pulmonary suffering was his physical\r\ninfirmity—his relief, tobacco, the fumes of which aver surrounded him like\r\na halo. He abounded in the gloom and glory of the American Revolution, and\r\npublished, with portraits, numerous diagrams of the campaigns of the war\r\nin the _Military Repository_, a work of great fidelity, in which it is\r\nthought he was aided by Baron Steuben and General Gates. As a\r\nbibliopolist, little need be said of him. But the curious in knowledge\r\nwill not overlook him as the first who popularly made known to the English\r\nreader the names of Kotzebue and Schiller. Several of the novels and plays\r\nof these German authors were done into English by him; and, with William\r\nDunlap, both as a translator and as a theatrical manager, _The Stranger_\r\nand other plays were presented to the cultivators of the drama in New-York\r\nlong before their appearance in London, or the publication of Thompson’s\r\n_German Theatre_. It is a circumstance worthy of notice, that the Rev. Mr.\r\nWill, then of this city, added to the stock of our literary treasures, by\r\nother translations into the English, such as the _Constant Lovers, &c._,\r\nof Kotzebue, before, I believe, any recognized English version appeared\r\nabroad. But I must leave this subject for the fuller investigation of the\r\nlearned Dr. Schmidt professor of German, in Columbia College.\r\n\r\nDavid Longworth’s name is a good deal blended with the progress of\r\nAmerican literature during years gone by. He was by birth a New Jerseyman;\r\nand the publication of his _City Directory_, for some thirty or more\r\nyears, gave him sufficient notoriety; while his Shaksperean Gallery\r\nintroduced him to many of the cultivators of the fine arts, at a period,\r\nwhen Trumbull and Jarvis were our prominent painters. Longworth had been\r\nbrought up as a printer, at a daily press, but he seems early to have got\r\na taste for copper-plate engraving, accurate printing, and elegant\r\nbinding. With determined energy he issued an edition of Telemachus, which,\r\nfor beauty of typography and paper, was looked upon, by the lovers of\r\nchoice books, as a rich specimen of our art. His _Belles-Lettres\r\nRepository_ no less evinced his taste in the _elegantiæ literarum_. He\r\nwas, nevertheless, a man of many strange notions. It is well known that\r\nabout the commencement of the eighteenth century, in our English books,\r\nprinted in the mother country, the substantive words were almost always\r\nbegun with a capital; the like practice obtained in many newspapers; but\r\nLongworth, not content with the partial change which time had brought\r\nabout, of sinking these prominent and advantageous upper case type, waged\r\na war of extermination against almost every capital in the case, and this\r\ncurious deformity is found in many of his publications, as _british\r\namerica_, and _london docks_. Even in poetry, of the first word, he\r\ntolerated only small letters at the beginning of the lines. His practice,\r\nhowever, found no imitators, though ’tis said that it first began in\r\nParis. His bookstore, at a central situation by the Park, with works of\r\ntaste classically displayed, afforded an admirable lounge for the\r\nlitterateurs of that day. Here, when Hodgkinson, and Hallam, and Cooper,\r\nand Cooke were at the zenith of their histrionic career in the Park\r\nTheatre, adjacent, might be seen a group of poets and prose writers, who,\r\nin their generation, added to the original off-spring of the American\r\npress—Brockden Brown, Dunlap, Verplanck, Paulding Fessenden, Richard\r\nAlsop, Peter Irving, and the now universally famed Washington Irving.\r\n\r\nI must note a circumstance of some import on the state of letters among us\r\nabout those times. Longworth had secured from abroad a copy of the first\r\nedition, in quarto, of Scott’s _Lay of the Last Minstrel_, and determined\r\nto reprint it; yet, not satisfied with his own judgment, he convened a\r\nmeeting of his literary friends to settle the matter. The committee, after\r\nsolemn deliberation, suggested his venturing to reproduce only the\r\nintroductions to the cantos, as an experiment, in order to ascertain the\r\npublic taste. Would I speak in terms too strong if I affirmed that since\r\nthat committee sat, millions of copies of the numerous volumes of Sir\r\nWalter Scott have been bought by the reading world in America. My circle\r\nof literary acquaintance was a good deal enlarged by the coteries I now\r\nand then found at Longworth’s, as he was not backward in seizing\r\nopportunities of issuing new works, when from their nature they might\r\nexcite the appetite of the curious. No publication of his so effectually\r\nsecured this end, as the _Salmagundi_, in 1807, sent forth in bi-weekly\r\nnumbers by young Irving and his friend Paulding. When we are apprised that\r\nsome few of our middle-aged citizens, who sustained the stroke of that\r\nliterary scimetar so long ago, still survive among us, I think we may\r\nargue from strong data for the salubrity of our climate. At Longworth’s, I\r\nfirst saw the youngest dramatic genius of the time, Howard Payne, then\r\nabout fourteen years old, and who, a short while after, appeared as young\r\nNorval on the boards of the theatre. He was editor of the _Thespian\r\nMirror_.\r\n\r\nOriginally of Ireland, Hugh Gaine, upon his emigration to this country\r\nduring our colonial dependence, set up in this city in 1753 his Royal\r\nGazette, the _New-York Mercury_. His fame as well as his patriotism is\r\nembalmed in the irony of Freneau. It is only as a bookseller that I knew\r\nhim, in Hanover Square. He was then at a very advanced age. His savings\r\nrendered him in due time independent in pecuniary matters. We may safely\r\ninfer that he was not surpassed in industry, and that he was ever awake to\r\nthe main chance, when we are assured that at the commencement of his\r\njournal, he collected his own news, set up his types, worked off his\r\npapers, folded his sheets, and personally distributed them to his\r\nsubscribers. Franklin had done pretty nearly the same things before.\r\nGaine, who in his after-life was an object of a good deal of curiosity to\r\nthe citizens of the republic, enjoyed the consideration due to an honest\r\nman, and many kindly feelings.\r\n\r\nMany as were his merits, and great as was his enterprise, Isaac Collins\r\nwas most widely known, the latter part of his long career, by his editions\r\nof the works on grammar, and other school books, by the prolific Lindley\r\nMurray. As in the case of Franklin, his earliest effort of magnitude was\r\nthe printing Sewell’s _History of the Quakers_. The neatness and accuracy\r\nof his printing were familiarly remarked among readers; and these\r\nexcellencies he displayed in his quarto Bible, the first of that form\r\nwhich was printed in this country in 1790. Collins was a native of\r\nDelaware. He projected a weekly paper, the _New Jersey Gazette_, which he\r\npublished at Burlington during the Revolution, and, some time after, upon\r\nstrenuous Whig principles. He had authority, like Franklin, for the\r\nemission of paper money for the State Government. He removed to this city\r\nin 1796, and a few years after this time I knew him. As his career was,\r\nmany portions of it, like Franklin’s, I had the greater admiration of him.\r\nHe died in 1817. That he enjoyed the acquaintance of Franklin, of\r\nRittenhouse and Rush, of Livingston of New Jersey, and others of the\r\ntruest patriots in the great struggles of the country, may be inferred\r\nfrom his profession, his public station, his integrity, and his general\r\ncharacter. In the society of Friends he was prominent, and, like Thomas\r\nEddy and Robert Bowne, he was occupied with hospitals, and ever zealous in\r\ngood works. He did vast service to the city as a printer, and as such he\r\nis here introduced.\r\n\r\nThe oldest inhabitants of our city may well recollect the bookstore of the\r\nSwords, Thomas and James. Some sixty years ago they began operations in\r\nPearl-street. They commenced when New-York was little more than a village\r\nin population, and when literary projects were almost unknown. They\r\ndeserve ample notice as most efficient pioneers, in their day, as printers\r\nand booksellers, and through a long career they held a high rank; they\r\nwere assiduous and economical almost to a fault: their integrity was never\r\ndoubted; their word was as good as their bond. They printed good works in\r\nmore acceptations of the phrase than one. They did a great service to our\r\nscientific enterprise, in issuing the _Medical Repository_, the earliest\r\njournal of that kind, in the country. A literary periodical, of many years\r\nduration, was also printed by them, called the _New-York Magazine_. It was\r\nremarkable for the contributions of a society, self-named the Drone.\r\nBrockden Brown, William Dunlap, Anthony Bleucker, Josiah Ogden Hoffman,\r\nand James Kent (afterwards the great Chancellor), were among the writers.\r\nWilliam Johnson, the well-known Reporter, who died recently, was the last\r\nsurvivor of this club. Their store for a number of years was a rendezvous\r\nfor professional men of different callings—divines, physicians, lawyers,\r\nwith a sprinkling of the professed authors of those times, as Clifton,\r\nLow, Davis, &c. Its theological feature was its strongest; and the\r\ninterest of episcopacy were here descanted on with the unction of\r\ngodliness, by such men as Seabury of Connecticut, and Moore of New-York,\r\nwith good old Dr. Bowden, and Dr. Hawks, my friends Drs. Berrian and\r\nMcVicker of Columbia College, and the energetic Bishop Hobart, the busiest\r\nand most stirring man I ever knew. The Messrs. Swords were largely\r\noccupied in printing works on divinity, and were confessed the printers of\r\nsound orthodoxy long before \"the novelties which disturb our peace\" had\r\ninvoked polemical controversy.\r\n\r\nI should do injustice to my feelings were I in this rapid sketch to\r\noverlook the late James Eastburn, the founder of the first reading-room on\r\na becoming scale, in this country, and the publisher of the American\r\nedition of the Edinburgh and London Quarterly Reviews. He was a gentleman\r\ndeserving of much estimation, of bland manners, and enthusiastic in his\r\ncalling. He was curious in antiquarian literature and a great importer of\r\nthe older authors. Many are the libraries enriched by his perseverance.\r\nConsumption wasted his generous frame, and he died at a comparatively\r\nearly age, to the deep regret of the scholar and the philanthropist.\r\n\r\nI should like, before I close this portion of these reminiscences, to\r\nawaken recollections of one or two other estimable individuals with whom I\r\nwas long acquainted—George F. Hopkins and Jonathan Seymour. Hopkins merits\r\na biography; he justly boasted that his edition of Robertson’s Charles V.\r\nwas the most accurately printed work of the time. He was fastidious almost\r\nto a fault in typographical neatness. He printed only works of positive\r\nmerit. His enterprise led him, now fifty years ago, to urge the craft to\r\nrender themselves independent of imported types, by establishing\r\ntype-foundries in the country. There were few indeed among us who knew\r\npractically much about the founts of Caslon, the Coryphæus of\r\nletter-founders. The Scotch hard-faced letter was then extensively in use.\r\nHopkins induced the immigration to this country of the famous Binney and\r\nRonaldson, whose great skill in the art was soon recognized, and from that\r\nera up to the present day competent judges affirm that our Bruce, White,\r\nConner, and others, have accomplished all that is requisite in the\r\ntype-founding business. Of Jonathan Seymour, it is enough to say, that at\r\none period of his life he was more largely engaged than any of his rivals\r\nin printing from manuscripts—so well known and appreciated was his\r\ndevotion to his calling, and the accuracy of its results. In his death,\r\nthe art lost one who had given it elevation, and society a man possessed\r\nof the qualities of industry, temperance, honesty, and Christian\r\nphilanthropy in the fullest measure.\r\n\r\nWithin a few days has departed from among us, at the age of eighty years,\r\na supporter of the press who long contributed to the diffusion of\r\nwholesome knowledge. I allude to Thomas Kirk. I shall terminate these\r\nnotices by a striking occurrence, which involved him in great loss. He had\r\ndetermined, about the year 1801, to give the Christian community an octavo\r\nedition, in large type, of the _Book of Common Prayer_, the first of that\r\nsize from an American press. To secure the utmost accuracy, he engaged,\r\nfor a pecuniary consideration, the Rev. John Ireland, of Brooklyn, to\r\nrevise the proofs. When the sheets were worked off, it was ascertained\r\nthat the copy was an exact reprint, save in one particular. The critical\r\nacumen of Ireland had discovered, in the Apostles’ Creed, a \"tautological\r\nerror,\" in the words, \"from thence he shall come.\" The word \"from\" was\r\nsuperfluous, ungrammatical, and inelegant, according to Ireland, and,\r\naccordingly, it was not in Kirk’s edition. Upon the sale of a few copies\r\nthe omission was remarked; the fact became known to the bishop of the\r\nchurch; the book was pronounced defective, and the ecclesiastical\r\nauthorities prohibited its circulation. The whole edition fell a dead\r\nweight upon the hands of the well-meaning publisher. I had this anecdote\r\nfrom Mr. Kirk himself, years ago, and he repeated it to me not long prior\r\nto his death, in last November.\r\n\r\nThis allusion to Kirk brings to my mind the notorious John Williams,\r\nbetter known as Anthony Pasquin, under which name he was doomed to\r\neverlasting infamy by Gifford, in his satire of the _Baviad and Mæviad_,\r\nin judgments afterwards confirmed in a celebrated trial for libel in which\r\nthe famous Erskine delivered one of his best forensic speeches. Williams\r\nwas the associate in London of a small but ambitious set of mutual\r\nadmirers in literature, of whom Mr. Merry and his future wife were the\r\n\"Della Crusca\" and \"Rosa Matilda,\" and all three of these worthies came to\r\nNew-York about the year 1798. I have an impression that Kirk came at the\r\nsame time. The character of Williams was infamous, and a large share of\r\nhis infamy consisted in his ministering to, if not creating, the passion\r\nfor personal scandal, and setting the example of black-mail collections,\r\nin newspapers. In the report of the great case of Williams vs. Faulder, it\r\nis said of his paper, called _The World_, that \"In this were given the\r\nearliest specimens of those unqualified and audacious attacks on all\r\nprivate character which the town first smiled at for their quaintness,\r\nthen tolerated for their absurdity—and will have to lament to the last\r\nhour of British liberty.\" After he came to this country he associated\r\nhimself with the enemies of Hamilton, and published a satire called _The\r\nHamiltoniad_, edited a magazine entitled _The Columbian_, and was a\r\npioneer in that species of journalism which still subsists here upon the\r\nmost scandalous invasions of private life and reputation. He was doubly\r\ndetestable, in that he was the corruptor and worst specimen of the\r\neditorial calling in Europe and in America. I remember frequently seeing\r\nWilliams, in the latter part of his life, in his shabby pepper-and-salt\r\ndress, in the obscure parts of the city. I believe he died during the\r\nfirst prevalence of the cholera in Brooklyn. Fancy may depict his\r\nexpression as illustrating Otway’s lines, \"as if all hell were in his\r\neyes, and he in hell.\" It must not be supposed that I in any degree\r\nassociate the fame of the worthy Kirk with that of this literary vagabond.\r\n\r\nTo a suggestion that I might refer to the late William Cobbett, as\r\nassociated with the periodical press of this country, I may say that I see\r\nin it no impropriety. Unquestionably a minute record would include his\r\n_Porcupine Gazette_ and his _Weekly Register_; the one an offspring of his\r\njuvenile life, the other of his ripened years. I had some personal\r\nacquaintance with him at the time of his last residence in New-York.\r\nHazlitt has, in his attractive manner, described him to the life. He was\r\ndeemed the best talker of his day, and his forcible pen has given us\r\nindubitable proofs of his powers in literary composition. It was not\r\nunusual with him to make a visit to the printing office at an early\r\nmorning hour, take his seat at the desk, and after some half dozen lines\r\nwere written, to throw off MSS. with a rapidity that engaged eleven\r\ncompositors at once in setting up. Thus a whole sheet of the _Register_\r\nmight be completed ere he desisted from his undertaking. I think that in\r\nquickness he surpassed even the lamented William Leggett, of the _Evening\r\nPost_. The circumstance is certainly interesting in a psychological point\r\nof view; and yet may not be deemed more curious than the fact that\r\nPriestley made his reply to Lind, quite a voluminous pamphlet, in\r\ntwenty-four hours, or that Hodgkinson, the actor, was able to peruse\r\ncrosswise, the entire five columns of a newspaper, and within two hours\r\nrecite it thus by memory. I visited Cobbett, when his residence was within\r\na couple of miles of this city, in company with a few professional\r\ngentlemen. It was in October, and a delightful day. He heard our approach,\r\nand came to the door without our knocking. \"Walk in, gentlemen—am I to\r\nconsider this as a visit to me?—walk in and be seated on these benches,\r\nfor I have no chairs—you may be fatigued—will you have a bowl of milk? I\r\nlive upon milk and Indian corn—I never drink spirit or wine, and yet I am\r\na tolerable example of English health.\" And, indeed, he was a most ample\r\nspecimen of the genuine John Bull. His nearly oval face, and florid\r\ncountenance, with strong gray piercing eyes and head thickly covered with\r\nwhite hair, closely trimmed; his huge frame, of some two hundred and\r\nseventy pounds weight, corresponding abdominal development, and\r\nwell-proportioned limbs, all demonstrated, with anatomical accuracy, the\r\ntruth of his observation. His superior intellect seemed roused in all its\r\nfunctions. The United States, England, the reform measures, the union of\r\nchurch and state, and its absurdity, were only a few of the subjects of\r\nhis caustic remark. \"I have just performed a duty, gentlemen, which has\r\nbeen too long delayed; you have neglected the remains of Thomas Paine; I\r\nhave done myself the honor to disinter his bones; I have removed them from\r\nNew Rochelle; I have dug them up; they are now on their way to England;\r\nwhen I return, I shall cause them to speak the Common Sense of the great\r\nman; I shall gather together the people of Liverpool and Manchester in one\r\nassembly with those of London, and those bones will effect the reformation\r\nof England in Church and State.\" After some two or three hours we took our\r\nleave, with unlimited admiration of his brave utterance and his colloquial\r\ntalents.\r\n\r\nWith such a hastily written and imperfect sketch of the newspaper\r\nperiodical press, of printers, editors, booksellers, and authors, I must\r\nclose this portion of my present reminiscences. I have depended on a\r\nmemory somewhat tenacious as my authority, in most instances, having no\r\nleisure at command for reference. A volume might be written of pertinent\r\ndetails. Nevertheless, enough has been said to illustrate, in part, the\r\nadvancement of one species of knowledge in this metropolis. Did we\r\ninstitute a comparative view of the past and present condition of the\r\npress, we might be better enabled to announce the existing condition of\r\nour city as a Literary Emporium, That it is in accordance with the spirit\r\nof the age, seems demonstrable. Abroad, in England, in 1701, when the\r\nstamp duty was levied upon every number of a periodical paper consisting\r\nof a sheet, the whole quantity of printed paper was estimated at twenty\r\nthousand reams annually. Nearly at this period (1704), when the Boston\r\n_News Letter_ made its appearance in the American colonies, some two or\r\nthree hundred copies weekly may have been its circulation. What is the\r\nquantity of paper demanded by the present British periodical press, I am\r\nunable to state. In this month of January, 1852, it is calculated that\r\nthere are about three thousand different newspapers and other periodicals\r\nprinted in this country, the entire issues of which approach the yearly\r\naggregate of four hundred and twenty-three millions of numbers.\r\n\r\nWhen Franklin was a printer it was a hard task to work off over a thousand\r\nsheets on both sides in a day, by the hand press. Since his time we have\r\nhad the Clymer, the Napier, the Ramage, the Adams, and now Hoe’s Lightning\r\npress. By this last-named achievement in the arts, so honorable to a son\r\nof New-York, and so stupendous in its results to the world at large,\r\ntwenty thousand papers may be printed in one hour.\r\n\r\nIf we advert to the instructive fact, of the enormous circulation of many\r\nof the journals of New-York, as the _Herald_, the _Sun_, the _Tribune_,\r\nthe _Times_, the _Express_, the _Mirror_, and others issued daily; if we\r\ncalculate the copies of the _Observer_, the _Home Journal_, the _Christian\r\nAdvocate_, and others of the weekly press; the circulation of the monthly\r\nand other periodicals; if we look at the Methodist Book Concern, the Tract\r\nSociety, the American Bible Society, the publications of the Appletons, of\r\nPutnam, and of the enterprising booksellers of this city generally, what\r\nbounds can we set to the offspring of the typographic art? The _Herald_\r\nand the _Tribune_ in their distinct circulation, consume an aggregate of\r\nfifty thousand reams per year. The Harpers, who have thrown John\r\nBaskerville, and other eminent typographers of Europe in the shade by the\r\nmagnitude of their operations, use one hundred reams of paper daily, at\r\nsix dollars per ream, and make about ten volumes a minute or six thousand\r\na day. On a former occasion I stated to you the agency which Franklin had\r\nin bringing forward stereotype plates, as projected by Dr. Colden, in this\r\ncity, in 1779, and the fact that the art was communicated to Didot in\r\nParis, by Franklin himself. I well remember the anxious John Watts, when\r\nhe showed me his first undertaking in this branch of labor in New-York,\r\njust forty years ago. It was a copy of the Larger Catechism, the one I now\r\nhold in my hand. Notwithstanding the doubts of many, he felt confident of\r\nits ultimate success, yet suffered by hope deferred. What is now the state\r\nof the business in the matter of stereotyping? The Harpers alone—a single\r\nfirm—have within their vaults plates for more than two thousand volumes.\r\n\r\nNeed I dwell on the improved appliances in the great art, which enrich the\r\npresent day, or on the influences now at work on the intellectual man?\r\nJustly has it been stated, that the press of a single office in this city\r\nissues more matter than the industry of the world, with all its scribes\r\nand illuminators, in an entire year, previous the time of Faust. Let us,\r\nthen, reverence the press, as our Franklin did. Let us cherish its\r\nfreedom, as the triumph of our fathers, if we love the name of patriot.\r\nLet us teach our children to acknowledge it the palladium of our altars\r\nand our firesides. Let us recognize it as the Great Instructor, knocking\r\nat every door, and rendering every hovel, as well as every palace, a\r\nschool-house.\r\n\r\nNor is it solely on the score of quantity, that we are to contemplate the\r\nmeasures now in force for the disciplining of intellect, and the rearing\r\nthe moral edifice of the nation. I have already remarked on the superior\r\nability of the press of our days in comparison with that of the period\r\nthrough which some of us have lived. The same energy which has swelled its\r\ndimensions, has increased the excellence of its material. Libraries so\r\nabound, knowledge is so diffused, that individuals qualified by scholastic\r\npowers, can be called in requisition for the duties of every department a\r\nsuccessful journal demands. There is moreover a happier recognition of\r\nintellectual merit; reward is higher and more certain; and there exists\r\nthroughout the community a noble estimation of productive intellect.\r\nInstead of a scattered recruit here and there in the ranks of literature,\r\nwe have armies at command, of well-disciplined men; and the belief is not\r\naltogether idle that, in due season, of these armies there will be\r\nlegions. Lovesick tales and Della Cruscan poetry, have yielded to stately\r\nessays on the business of life, in philosophy and in criticism, while the\r\nnative muse has often stronger claims to our homage than the verses Dr.\r\nJohnson has embalmed, and that have made the fame of ancient bards. We no\r\nlonger gaze at the author as a drone in the hive of industry.\r\n\r\nOur youth are taught that a true man may be found among the luxurious and\r\nrefined as well in the humble avocations of life. Ambitious of a national\r\nliterature, we honor those who have laid its foundations, in the persons\r\nof an Irving, a Prescott, and a Bancroft, a Longfellow, and a Hawthorne.\r\nWe gratefully remember our historical obligations to Sparks. We feel the\r\ndignity of the scholar when we summon to our aid the classical Everett.\r\nMourning with no feigned sorrow the demise of that true son of our soil,\r\nthe lamented Cooper, we rejoice that a Bryant and a Halleck, a Verplanck\r\nand a Paulding, are still left with us. Warm in our feelings, and made\r\nhappier by the relations of intercourse, we extend the cordial hand to\r\nTuckerman, our classical essayist and poet; to Willis, for his felicitous\r\ncomments on passing events; to Griswold, for his admirable works in\r\ncriticism and biography; to Dr. Mayo, for his _Kaloolah_; to Stoddard, for\r\nhis exquisite poems; to the generous Bethune, the orator and bard; to\r\nMorris, for his _Melodies_; to Kimball, for his _St. Leger Papers_; to\r\nClark, for his _Knickerbocker_; to Melville, for _Typee_; to Ik. Marvell,\r\nfor his _Reveries_; to Ripley, for his fine reviews; to Bigelow, for his\r\nbook on _Jamaica_; to Bayard Taylor, for his _Views A-Foot_; to Greeley,\r\nfor his _Crystal Palace_ labors; and to Duyckinck, the son of our old\r\nfriend, the bookseller, for his _Literary World_. In the name of the\r\nRepublic, we give our heartiest thanks to our intimate friend, the learned\r\nDr. Cogswell, as we look at the spacious walls of the Astor Library.\r\n\r\nThe very great length to which I have unconsciously extended these\r\nreminiscences, forbids me from dwelling, as my heart and your wishes\r\ndictate, upon the most glorious name in American Printing, the immortal\r\nFranklin’s. His character and deeds, however, are familiar to you all; and\r\nthe language of eulogy is needless in regard to one whose fame increases\r\nwith time, and whose transcendent merits, the constant development of that\r\nelement he brought under human dominion render daily more evident and\r\nmemorable. It is related, gentlemen, that when the statues of the Roman\r\nEmperors were carried in a triumphal procession, one was omitted, and the\r\nname of that one was shouted with more zeal than all the others inspired.\r\nSo I know it to be with us to-night. The memory of Franklin is too ripe in\r\nour hearts to require words; it is a spell that sheds eternal glory on the\r\ntypographical art; it is the best encouragement of youthful energy; it is\r\nrevealed in every telegraphic despatch; it hallows the name of our country\r\nto the civilized world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOCTES AMICÆ.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf tipsy drollery, a correspondent of the _Evening Post_ (Mr. Bryant\r\nhimself, we have no doubt), writes: \"It is esteemed a mark of a vulgar\r\nmind, to divert one’s self at the expense of a drunken man; yet we allow\r\nourselves to be amused with representations of drunkenness on the stage\r\nand in comic narratives. Nobody is ashamed to laugh at Cassio in the play\r\nof Othello, when he has put an enemy into his mouth to steal away his\r\nbrains. The personation which the elder Wallack used to give us some years\r\nago, of Dick Dashall, very drunk, but very gentlemanly, was one of the\r\nmost irresistibly comic things ever known. I have a mind to give you a\r\ntranslation of a German ballad on a tipsy man, which has been set to\r\nmusic, and is often sung in Germany; it is rather droll in the original,\r\nand perhaps it has not lost all of its humor in being _overset_, as they\r\ncall it, into English. Here it is:\"\r\n\r\n                         OUT OF THE TAVERN, ETC.\r\n\r\n  Out of the tavern I’ve just stepped to-night\r\n  Street! you are caught in a very bad plight.\r\n  Right hand and left hand are both out of place;\r\n  Street, you are drunk, ’tis a very clear case.\r\n\r\n  Moon, ’tis a very queer figure you cut;\r\n  One eye is staring while t’other is shut.\r\n  Tipsy, I see; and you’re greatly to blame;\r\n  Old as you are ’tis a terrible shame.\r\n\r\n  Then the street lamps, what a scandalous sight!\r\n  None of them soberly standing upright.\r\n  Rocking and staggering; why, on my word,\r\n  Each of the lamps is drunk as a lord.\r\n\r\n  All is confusion; now isn’t it odd?\r\n  I am the only thing sober abroad.\r\n  Sure it were rash with this crew to remain,\r\n  Better go into the tavern again.\r\n\r\nThis is parodied or stolen by the clever author of the _Bon Gaultier\r\nBallads_, in one of his best pieces.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe famous Quaker _Anthony Benezet_, was accustomed to feed the rats in\r\nthe area before his house in Philadelphia. An old friend who found him so\r\nengaged, expressed some surprise that he so kindly treated such pernicious\r\nvermin, saying, \"They should rather be killed and out of the way.\" \"Nay,\"\r\nsaid good Anthony, \"I will not treat them so; thou wouldst make them\r\nthieves by maltreating and starving them, but I make them honest by\r\nfeeding them, for being so fed, they never prey upon any goods of mine.\"\r\nThis singular fact is very characteristic. When feeding rats, the\r\nbenevolent philosopher used to stand in the area, and they would gather\r\nround his feet like chickens. One of the family once hung a collar about\r\none of them, which was seen for years after, feeding in the group.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDES CARTES fought at the siege of Rochelle, and after a variety of\r\nadventures, established himself in Holland, where he composed most of his\r\nworks. These abound in singular theories and curious speculations, and\r\ntheir spirit of independence aroused the same spirit wherever they were\r\nread. Scholars and theologians vied with each other in battling the new\r\nopinions. The followers of Aristotle and the followers of Locke arrayed\r\nthemselves against him. His novelties even drew the attention of women\r\nfrom their fashions. \"The ladies of quality here, of late,\" says a writer\r\nfrom Paris, in 1642, \"addict themselves to the study of philosophy, as the\r\nmen; the ladies esteeming their education defective, if they cannot\r\nconfute Aristotle and his disciples. The pen has almost supplanted the\r\nexercise of the needle; and ladies’ closets, formerly the shops of female\r\nbaubles, toys, and vanities, are now turned to libraries and sanctuaries\r\nof learned works. There is a new star risen in the French horizon, whose\r\ninfluence excites the nobler females to this pursuit of human science. It\r\nis the renowned Monsieur Des Cartes, whose lustre far outshines the aged\r\nwinking tapers of Peripatetic Philosophy, and has eclipsed the stagyrite,\r\nwith all the ancient lights of Greece and Rome. ’Tis this matchless soul\r\nhas drawn so many of the fairer sex to the schools. And they are more\r\nproud of the title—Cartesian—and of the capacity to defend his principles,\r\nthan of their noble birth and blood.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe find in _The Courts of Europe at the Close of the last Century_, by\r\nHenry Swinburne, the following illustration of American manners:\r\n\r\n\"An English officer, Colonel A in a stage to New-York, and was extremely\r\nannoyed by a free and enlightened citizen’s perpetually spitting across\r\nhim, out of the window. He bore it patiently for some time, till at last\r\nhe ventured to remonstrate, when the other said, ’Why, colonel, I estimate\r\nyou’re a-poking fun at me—that I do. Now, I’m not a-going to chaw my own\r\nbilge-water, not for no man. Besides, you need not look so thundering\r\nugly. Why, I’ve _practised_ all my life, and could squirt through the eye\r\nof a needle without touching the steel, let alone such a great saliva-box\r\nas that there window.’ Colonel A at last his anger got up, and he spat\r\nbang in his companion’s face, exclaiming, ’I beg you a thousand pardons,\r\nsquire, but I’ve not practised as much as you have. No doubt, by the time\r\nwe reach New-York, I shall be as great a dabster as you are.’ The other\r\nrubbed his eye, and remained _bouche close_.\"\r\n\r\nIn support of the hydropathic practice, and in illustration of the effect\r\nof cold, we cite an anecdote MIGNET tells of the celebrated French\r\nphysician Broussais:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"Seized with a violent fever at Nimèguen, Broussais was attended\r\n    by two of his friends, who each prescribed opposite remedies.\r\n    Embarrassed by such contradictory opinions, he resolved to follow\r\n    neither. Believing himself to be seriously in danger, he jumped\r\n    out of bed in the midst of this raging fever, and almost naked sat\r\n    down to his escrutoire to arrange his papers. It was in the month\r\n    of January; the streets were covered with snow. While thus\r\n    settling his affairs the fever abated, a sensation of freshness\r\n    and comfort diffused itself throughout his frame. Amazed at this\r\n    result, Broussais, like a bold theorist as he was, converted his\r\n    casual forgetfulness into an experience. He boldly _threw open the\r\n    window_, and for some time inspired the cold winter air that blew\r\n    in upon him. Finding himself greatly benefited, he concluded that\r\n    cool drink would be as refreshing to his stomach as cold air had\r\n    been to his body. He deluged his stomach with cold lemonade, and\r\n    in less than forty-eight hours he was well again!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following amusing anecdote is told in a work recently published in\r\nLondon of Tom Cooke, the actor and musician:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"At a trial in the Court of King’s Bench, June, 1833, betwixt\r\n    certain publishing tweedledums and tweedledees, as to the alleged\r\n    piracy of an arrangement of the ’Old English Gentleman,’—an old\r\n    English air, by the bye—Cooke was subpœnaed as a witness. On his\r\n    cross-examination by Sir James Scarlet, afterwards Lord Abinger,\r\n    for the opposite side, that learned counsel rather flippantly\r\n    questioned him thus: ’Now, sir, you say that the two melodies are\r\n    the same, but different; now what do you mean by that, sir?’ To\r\n    this Tom promptly answered, ’I said that the notes in the two\r\n    copies were alike, but with a different accent, the one being in\r\n    common time, the other in sixth-eight time; and, consequently, the\r\n    position of the accented notes was different.’ Sir James—’What is\r\n    musical accent?’ Cooke—’My terms are a guinea a lesson, sir.’ (A\r\n    loud laugh.) Sir James (rather ruffled)—’Never mind your terms\r\n    here. I ask you what is musical accent. Can you see it?’\r\n    Cooke—’No.’ Sir James—’Can you feel it?’ Cooke—’A musician can.’\r\n    (Great laughter.) Sir James (very angry)—’Now, pray sir, don’t\r\n    beat about the bush, but explain to his lordship and the jury, who\r\n    are supposed to know nothing about music, the meaning of what you\r\n    call accent.’ Cooke—’Accent in music, is a certain stress laid\r\n    upon a particular note, in the same manner as you would lay a\r\n    stress upon any given word for the purpose of being better\r\n    understood. Thus, if I were to say, ’You are an _ass_—it rests on\r\n    ass; but if I were to say, ’_You_ are an ass—it rests on you, Sir\r\n    James.’ Reiterated shouts of laughter by the whole court, in which\r\n    the bench itself joined, followed this repartee. Silence having\r\n    been at length obtained, the Judge, with much seeming gravity,\r\n    accosted the chop-fallen counsel thus: Lord Denman—’Are you\r\n    satisfied, Sir James?’ Sir James (deep red as he naturally was, to\r\n    use poor Jack Reeve’s own words, had become scarlet in more than\r\n    name), in a great huff, said, ’The witness may go down!’\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA Portuguese paper gives some statistics which could only be obtained\r\nunder the spy and secret police system. There are said to be in Portugal\r\n872,634 married couples, of which the present condition is very nearly as\r\nfollows:—\"Women who have left their husbands for their lovers, 1,262.\r\nHusbands who have left their wives for other women, 2,361. Couples who\r\nhave agreed to live separately, 33,120. Couples who live in open warfare,\r\nunder the same roof, 13,263. Couples who cordially hate each other, but\r\ndissemble their aversion under the appearance of love, 162,320. Couples\r\nwho live in a state of tranquil indifference, 510,132. Couples who are\r\nthought by their acquaintances to be happy, but are not themselves\r\nconvinced of their own felicity, 1,102. Couples that are happy as compared\r\nwith those that are confessedly unhappy, 131. Couples indisputably happy\r\nin each other, 0. Total, 872,634.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first duel in New England, was fought with sword and dagger, between\r\ntwo servants. Neither of them was killed, but both were wounded. For this\r\ndisgraceful offence, they were formally tried before the whole company\r\n(the first settlers), and sentenced to have their \"heads and feet tied\r\ntogether, and so to be twenty-four hours, without meat or drink.\" Their\r\nbravery all exploded in a little while, and they plead piteously to be\r\nreleased, which was finally done by the Governor on their promising better\r\nbehavior. \"Such was the origin,\" says Dr. Morse, \"and such, I may almost\r\nventure to say, was the termination of the odious practice of duelling in\r\nNew England, for there have been very few fought there since.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are told by Ariosto of a warrior who was so happily gifted that when\r\nhis arms, his legs, or even his head, happened to be chopped off in\r\nbattle, he could jump down from his horse and replace the dissevered\r\nmember. Many modern humbugs are of this description; they are real polipi;\r\nchop them into a thousand pieces, and each piece will start up as brisk\r\nand as lively as ever. Metaphysical humbugs are the most difficult kind to\r\ndeal with. Contending with them is like wrestling with spectres; there is\r\nnot substance enough to catch hold of.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLately, at a sitting of the Norwegian legislature at Christiana, a\r\npetition was presented from the world-known fiddler, Ole Bull, in which he\r\nsolicited the creation of a national theatre in that town, to receive a\r\nsubvention from the government, and to which a dramatic school was to be\r\nattached. The Assembly voted that the petition should be taken into\r\nconsideration, and appointed a committee to draw up a report on it. M.\r\nBull has already founded, at his own cost, a theatre in his native town,\r\nBergen. M. Bull visits this country now in search only of pleasure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAUTHORS AND BOOKS\r\n\r\n\r\nGUTZKOW’S _Ritter vom Geiste_ (Knights of the Spirit) is at last finished,\r\nthe ninth volume having made its appearance. It has faults of detail, and\r\nthere are deficiencies in spots, but as a whole it is praised as eminently\r\nsuccessful, and truly a new work. The idea in some respects recalls the\r\nWilhelm Meister of Goethe, and the Nathan the Wise of Lessing, but the\r\nexecution has more force and a larger and more imperious movement than\r\neither. The Knights of the Spirit are a body of men who are combined in an\r\norder to which they give that name, and this book is their history and\r\nthat of the order. At the same time there is nothing mystical,\r\nsupernatural, or merely fantastic about it, though its spirit is\r\nhumanitary and even socialistic. The scene is in modern times, but though\r\nthe names of the heroes are German, and the circumstances in which they\r\nare placed German, the author has succeeded in producing a truly\r\ncosmopolitan romance. The nine volumes are sold in Germany for about $8\r\n00.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHENRY TAYLOR, the author of Philip Van Artevelde, is the subject of an\r\narticle in the _Grenzboten_. The writer takes him, as the acknowledged\r\nfirst living dramatic poet of England, to be the best illustration of the\r\nnature and characteristics of the English drama. This drama is said to be\r\nmore remarkable for sharply-outlined and detailed characters, than for the\r\ninvention of exciting and consistent action. The characters in all their\r\npeculiarities are first created, and situations are made and arranged for\r\nthem afterward. The evil of this is, that the whole thus becomes\r\nfragmentary, and the particulars outweigh and obscure the general spirit\r\nand intention of the piece. Even Shakspeare, with his gigantic genius, was\r\nnot free from this defect. His Merry Wives of Windsor, for instance, is\r\nrich in comic situations and figures, but they are arbitrarily put\r\ntogether, and every scene has the character of an episode; the action does\r\nnot go forward in a true and consistent course. Now-a-days the evil is\r\nworse, because it is the fashion to substitute reflection for natural\r\nfeeling. Taylor is like those portrait painters who paint the features so\r\ncarefully as to destroy the general character of the face. His men and\r\nwomen are not alive and genuine. Still their language is grave and noble,\r\ntheir thoughts comprehensive, often striking, and their emotions, though\r\nartificial, are elaborated with great insight and knowledge of the world.\r\nCompared with the wretched creations of the French romanticists, they are\r\nworthy of all praise. The critic then proceeds to analyze Isaac Comnenus,\r\nPhilip Van Atevelde, and Fair Edwin, setting forth with great fairness the\r\nexcellencies and faults of each.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA new contribution to an obscure but most interesting part of European\r\nhistory is _Deutschland in der Revolutions periode von_ 1522-26, (Germany,\r\nin the Revolutionary Period from 1522 to 26,) by JOSEPH EDMUND JÖRG. The\r\nauthor has had access to a great mass of original and hitherto unused\r\nmaterials, especially diplomatic correspondence and other documents in the\r\nBavarian archives. His view of the subject is very different from that\r\ntaken by ZIMMERMANN, in his _Peasants’ War_, or by any other writer. He\r\nmocks at the idea that this revolution grew out of the evils and\r\noppressions suffered by the people, and finds its most powerful impulse in\r\nthe passion for innovation that sprung up along with the revival of\r\nclassical studies in the middle ages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe antique fashion of presenting poetic works to the public, is revived\r\nin Germany with great success. Professor GRIEPENKERL of Brunswick, whose\r\ntragedy of Robespierre made a great sensation a year or more since, is now\r\nreading his new play of the Girondists to large audiences in the principal\r\ncities. He has already been heard at Brunswick, Leipzig, Dresden, and\r\nBremen, and proposes to visit other places on the same errand. The play,\r\nwhich is a tragedy of course, is much admired, though it is not thought to\r\nbe adapted to the stage. The Girondists were not men of action, but\r\norators and thinkers. The final scene in the play is the famous banquet\r\nbefore they were taken to execution. Charlotte Corday is among the\r\ncharacters; the women are said not to be drawn as truly and powerfully as\r\nthe men.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCARLYLE’S Life of Stirling is criticised in the _Grenzboten_, which calls\r\nCarlyle the strangest of all philosophers. This book is said, however, to\r\nbe, on the whole, clearer and more intelligible than most of his former\r\nproductions. Still, like most works of the new romantic school in England,\r\nof which Carlyle is the chief, it aims rather to give expression to the\r\nideas and abilities of the author, than to do justice to its subject. But\r\nit is in Warren’s _Lily and the Bee_, that the school appears in full\r\nbloom. This is said to consist mostly of exclamation points, and is\r\nwritten in a sort of lapidary style, that deals in riddles, pathos without\r\nobject, sentimentality with irony, world-pain, and allusions to all the\r\nkingdoms of heaven and earth, without any explanation as to what relation\r\nthese allusions bear to each other, and with a Titanic pessimism as its\r\npredominating tone, which first rouses itself up to take all by storm, and\r\nfinishes by being soothed into happy intoxication by the odors of a lily.\r\nThis is better treatment than _The Lily and the Bee_ gets at home.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the second volume of _Shakspeare as Protestant, Politician,\r\nPsychologist and Poet_, by DR. ED. VEHSE—spoken of as being \"even more\r\nuninteresting than the first,\" we find the two following extraordinary\r\nideas. Firstly, that Shakspeare followed a theory of physical\r\n_temperaments_ in his characters—that Hamlet was a representative of the\r\nmelancholy or nervous, Othello of the choleric, Romeo of the sanguine, and\r\nFalstaff of the phlegmatic. Secondly, that in Falstaff, Shakspeare\r\nparodied—himself! Or to give his own words, \"We may suppose that\r\nShakspeare’s physical constitution inclined to corpulence, and inspired in\r\nhim the disposition to the life of a _bon vivant_. His intimacy with the\r\nEarl of Southampton may have favored this disposition, since they led for\r\na long time a dissipated tavern-life, and were rivals in love matters!\"\r\nThe work is principally made up of extracts from Shakspeare’s plays, to\r\nevery which extract we find appended \"How admirable,\"—\"Excellent,\" and\r\nsimilar aids to those who are not familiar with the English bard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe commend to the attention of philologists Das _Gothische Runenalphabet_,\r\n(or The Gothic Runic Alphabet,) recently published by HERTZ of Berlin.\r\n\"Before Wulfila, the Goths had an alphabet of twenty-five letters, formed\r\naccording to the same principles, and bearing nearly the same names as the\r\n_Runes_ of the Anglo-Saxons and Northmen, and probably arranged in the\r\nsame order of succession. _Wulfila_ adopted the Grecian alphabet, which\r\nthrough his modification was received by the Goths to the old twenty-five\r\nletters.\" This is the theory propounded in the work, which is not wanting,\r\nas we learn, in instructive information. In connection with this we may\r\nnotice a book which has been deemed worthy of a modern English\r\nrepublication in elegant style, the often referred to _Scriptural Poems_\r\nof CÆDMON, in Anglo-Saxon, an edition of which, by R. W. BOUTERWEK, with\r\nan Anglo-Saxon Glossary, has recently been published by Bædeher of\r\nElberfeldt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe _Preussische Zeitung_ states that M. HANKE, a learned Bohemian, is\r\npublishing, in Prague, a _fac-simile_ of the Gospels on which the Kings of\r\nFrance have always been sworn at their coronation at Rheims. The\r\nmanuscript volume is in the Slavonian language, and has been preserved at\r\nRheims ever since the twelfth century, but it has only been lately\r\ndiscovered in what language it was written.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe eleventh volume of the _Monumenta Germaniæ Historica_ inde ab anno\r\nChristi 500 usque ad annum 1500 auspiciis societ, aperiendis fontibus\r\nserum German medii ævi edid, G. H. PERTZ, has just made its appearance.\r\nThis work is regarded as a stupendous effort of erudition and historical\r\nacumen, even in Germany.\r\n\r\nDR. HAGBERG, a professor at the University of Upsal, has just published at\r\nStockholm a version of the complete works of Shakspeare, the first ever\r\nmade in the Swedish language. It is in twelve thick octavo volumes. The\r\nShaksperian Society of London having received a presentation copy of this\r\ntranslation, has returned a vote of thanks to Dr. Hagberg, accompanied by\r\nforty volumes of the Society’s publications, all relating to the great\r\ndramatist and the state of dramatic art in his time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDUNLOP’S _History of Fiction_ has been translated into German by Professor\r\nLiebrecht of Liege, and enlarged so as to be much more complete than the\r\noriginal. The version bears the title of _Geschichte der Prosadichtung\r\noder, Geschichte der Romane, Novellen und Mährchen_ (History of Prose\r\nPoetry, or History of Romances, Novels and Traditional Tales). It gives a\r\ncomplete account of the most prominent fictions from the Greek romances\r\ndown to the present day, and is quite as valuable for those who like to\r\ntake their novels condensed, as for those who make a historical study of\r\nliterature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOLTEI, the German poet, has published a four-volume novel, called _Die\r\nVagabunden_ (The Vagabonds). It is a curious and successful book. It\r\ntreats of the various classes that get their living by amusing others, not\r\nmerely of theatrical and musical artists, but of circus-riders,\r\nventriloquists, jugglers, rope-dancers, puppet-showmen, &c. Indeed, actors\r\nand musicians are only introduced casually, while the lower classes, if we\r\nmay so call them, of wandering artists, make up the book; and they make it\r\nup not in the form of caricatures or exaggerations, but as genuine living\r\ncharacters, with the faults and virtues that really belong to men of their\r\nrespective professions The story is a good one, and is varied with all\r\nsorts of strange adventures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn poetry we observe the attractive title of _The Æolian Harp of the\r\nWorld’s Poetry_, a collection of poems of all countries and ages,\r\n\"dedicated to German ladies and maidens,\" by FERD. SCHMIDT. Also by the\r\nsame collector, a Household Treasury of the most beautiful Ballads,\r\nRomances, and Poetic Legends of all Times and Nations; by BRUNO LINDNER,\r\n_Four Tales_, and from the Countess AGNES SCHWERIN, a new edition of _What\r\nI heard from the bird_. Were we confident that the Countess were\r\nintimately familiar with English poetry, we should feel half inclined to\r\naccuse her of having taken this title from\r\n\r\n  \"High diddle ding, I heard a bird sing.\"\r\n\r\nG. PUSLITZ has \"thrown forth,\" as Bacchus threw the wreath of Ariadne, a\r\n\"garland of Stories,\" entitled _What the Forest Tells_. Whether, like the\r\nwreath alluded to, it will reach the stars, we must leave our readers or\r\nhis to decide.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Science, we observe the publication of a piece of eccentric nonsense\r\nsuch as emanates at the present day only from a weak brother in Germany,\r\nor occasionally from a would-be _original_ in New England. The work to\r\nwhich we refer is the _Natur und Geist_ (or _Nature and Spirit_) of DR.\r\nJOHANN RIOHERS. In the second volume he attempts to utterly overwhelm,\r\nconfound, and destroy Newton’s Theory of Attraction, by such an argument\r\nas the following. \"Let any man jump from a height, in descending he feels\r\nno _attraction_ to the Earth. How hasty and absurd therefore is it to\r\nattribute the movement in question to such an attraction.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA new collection of German Domestic Legends (_Haus Mährchen_) has been\r\npublished at Leipzig, by J.W. WOLF, a distinguished German philologist.\r\nHis Legends closely resemble those collected by Grimm, and, like them, are\r\ncurious and instructive. He obtained them, one from a Gipsey, others from\r\npeasants in the mountain districts, and others from some companies of\r\nHessian soldiers. He remarks that many such ancient legends are yet\r\nfloating about among the German people, and that they ought to be\r\ncollected before they are lost.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nZEND AVESTA, or On the things of Heaven and the World beyond the Grave, is\r\nthe title of a new book in three volumes just published at Leipzig, in\r\nGerman, of course, by GUSTAV THEODOR FECHNOR. The author attempts to prove\r\nthe possibility, if not the certainty, of a future life of the individual\r\nafter death. His demonstrations are drawn from the analogies of the\r\nnatural world. He exhibits a wide acquaintance with nature and with\r\nliterature, but is not thought to have made any positive additions to\r\npsychological science.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThose who are conversant with the curiosities of the Middle Ages, and have\r\nread the entertaining history of \"_Ye Nigromancer Virgilius_,\" in which\r\nthe Mantuan bard lives no longer in the magic of song, but that of literal\r\nsorcery, will peruse with pleasure the _Virgil’s Fortleben im\r\nMittelalter_, or The Life of Virgil continued in the Middle Ages, by G.\r\nRAPPERT. Of all the wild romantic legends which the romantic time brought\r\nforth, none surpass in singularity and interest this singular narration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTEMPERANCE TALES are produced in Germany as well as elsewhere. JEREMIAS\r\nGOTTHELF is the best author who there cultivates this style of\r\ncomposition. His _Dürsli, the Brandy drinker_, has just passed through a\r\nfourth edition, and _How five Maidens miserably perished in Brandy_, to a\r\nsecond. Gotthelf has the talent of combining great dramatic interest and\r\nartistic freshness of narration, with a moral purpose. Hence the\r\npopularity of these little books.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNIEHL’S _Bûrgerliche Gesellschaft_ (Civil Society) is greatly praised by\r\ncritics, as the most valuable work lately published in Germany, or indeed\r\nin Europe, upon the State of Society and the causes operating to change\r\nit. Especially good are its pictures of the different classes in Germany,\r\nsuch as the nobility, the peasantry, the industrious middle class, and the\r\nproletaries. These pictures are said to have the minuteness and fidelity\r\nof daguerreotypes. The chapter on the \"proletaries of intellectual labor,\"\r\ngives any thing but a flattering account of the literary classes on the\r\ncontinent. Those classes are held up as in a great measure perverted,\r\nempty, and dangerous. Niehl divides Society in Germany into four great\r\nclasses, namely: the peasantry, the aristocracy, the _bourgeoisie_ or\r\nmiddle class, and the proletariat, or mere laborers for wages. The last he\r\nregards as the decaying and corrupting class, a sort of scum in hot\r\neffervesence. This is, however, one of the classes that produce social\r\nmovement; the other is the middle class; the conservative or stationary\r\nclasses are the peasantry and aristocracy. The learned professions he\r\nreckons among the middle class. He makes no distinction between the\r\nproletaries who live by the soil, and those who live by working in\r\nconnection with manufactures and mechanical trades.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother contribution to Goethean literature is the Correspondence between\r\nthe great Poet and his intimate friend Knebel, which has just appeared in\r\nGermany in two volumes. The letters extend from 1774 to 1832, and contain\r\nthe free expression of Goethe’s opinions on a great variety of important\r\nsubjects, as well as many interesting particulars in his personal history,\r\nhitherto unknown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. WETZSTEIN, Prussian Consul at Damascus, has returned to Europe,\r\nbringing a valuable collection of Arabic, Turkish and Persian manuscripts,\r\nwhich he expects to sell to the Royal Library at Berlin. Of especial value\r\nis a history of Persia during the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, which\r\ncasts light on several portions of Persian history that have hitherto been\r\nobscure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLONGFELLOW’S _Evangeline_ has been translated into German and published at\r\nHamburg. The name of the translator is not given. The critics find that\r\nthe poem has a very marked resemblance to Goethe’s Herman and Dorothea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. MAYO’S _Berber_ has been translated into the German by Mr. L. Dubois,\r\nand published at Leipzig.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA new and splendid edition of the _Pilgrim’s Progress_ has been published\r\nat Leipzig, in German. It is curious to see the good old book discussed by\r\nthe critics as if it were a new production.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGerman Historical Literature has lately been enriched by numerous valuable\r\nworks. Among these we notice WENCK’S _Fränkische Reich_ (Frankish Empire),\r\nwhich treats that subject, from A.D. 843 to 861, with instructive\r\nthoroughness and philosophical insight; two essays by FICKER, the one on\r\nReinhald von Dassel, the Chancellor of Ferdinand I., and the other on the\r\nattempt of Henry VI. to render the German empire hereditary; ARNTHEN’S\r\n_History of Carinthia_; RINK’S _Tirol_; PALAZKY’S _History of Bohemia_;\r\nMINUTOLI’S _History of the Elector Frederic I._; RIEDEL’S _Ten years of\r\nthe History of the Ancestors of the Royal House of Prussia_; the _History\r\nof Schleswig Holstein_, by GEORGE WAITZ; RUCKERT’S _Annals of German\r\nHistory_; G. PHILIP’S _Outlines of the History of the German Empire and\r\nGerman Law_; GENGLER’S _History of German Law_; the _Coins of the German\r\nEmperors and Kings in the Middle Ages_, a large work by CAPPE; the _Celts\r\nand Ancient Helvetians_, by J. B. BROZI; and the _Campaigns of the\r\nBavarians_ from 1643 to 1645, by J. HELLMANN; MAYR’S _Mann von Rinn_ (Man\r\nof Rinn) deserves special mention. The man of Rinn is Joseph Speckbacher,\r\nthe hero of the war of 1809 in the Tyrol. His deeds, and those of his\r\ncountrymen, are here narrated in a style as attractive as the facts are\r\nauthentic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn all the States of the German Confederation there are 2,651 booksellers,\r\n400 of whom deal only in their own publications, 2,200 sell books, but do\r\nnot publish, and 451 keep general assortments of books, and publish also.\r\nAt Berlin there are 129 booksellers, at Leipzic, 145, at Vienna, 52, at\r\nStuttgard, 50, and at Frankfort, 36. A hundred years ago there were only\r\n31 at Leipzic and 6 at Berlin, and at two fairs held at Leipzic in 1750,\r\nonly 350 German booksellers’ establishments were represented. No one is\r\nallowed in Germany to become a bookseller without a license from the\r\ngovernment, and in Prussia the applicant has to pass a special\r\nexamination.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThose desirous of acquiring languages by wholesale, may try a recent work\r\nby Captain J. NEPOMUK SZÖLLÖZY, with which the scholar can learn,\r\naccording to the Ollendorffian system, French, German, English, Italian,\r\nRussian, Spanish, Hungarian, Wallachian and Turkish. Phrases and\r\nvocabularies of all the languages are appended.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA second edition of ADOLF STAHR’S _Preussische Revolution_, has appeared\r\nin Germany, revised by the author and dedicated to Macaulay. No recent\r\nbook in Germany has been more successful than this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAX SCHLESINGER’S _Wanderings through London_ are announced at Berlin; the\r\nfirst volume is already published. One of the chapters treats of\r\n\"Linkoln’s-In-Fields.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe learn from the last number of the _Journal Asiatique_, that M. WÖPCKE,\r\na mathematician who devotes himself to Arabic studies, has discovered in\r\nsome Arabic manuscripts two works purporting to be by Euclid, which have\r\nnot been preserved in the Greek original, nor are any where referred to as\r\nhis by ancient mathematical writers. One is a treatise on the lever, and\r\nthe other on the division of planimetric figures. The authenticity of the\r\ntwo is thought to be perfectly established by collateral evidence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Hungarian author. Baron Eötvös, has just published a work called\r\n_Ueber den Einfluss der Neuen Ideen auf den Staat_ (On the influence of\r\nnew ideas upon the State). He argues that the students of social and\r\npolitical science should confine themselves strictly to the method\r\nreceived in the natural sciences, and employed there with such success;\r\nfirst establish what are the genuine experimental phenomena, and then by\r\ninduction settle the law which produces and governs them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe expect a treat from MORITZ WAGNER’S _Reise nach Persien und dem Lande\r\nder Kurden_ (Journey to Persia and Kurdistan) the first volume of which is\r\nadvertised in our last files of German papers. Wagner is one of the best\r\nof travellers, and we shall look for the book itself with some impatience.\r\nThe second volume is announced as to appear in three weeks after the\r\nfirst.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe second part of the third volume of HUMBOLDT’S _Kosmos_, has just\r\nappeared at Stuttgart. It treats of the heavenly nebulae, suns, planets,\r\ncomets, aurora borealis, zodiacal light, meteors, and meteoric stones.\r\nThis completes the uranological part of the description of the physical\r\nuniverse. Humboldt has already begun his fourth volume, and expects to\r\nfinish it before June next.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKOSSUTH is speculated on by a German bookseller, who advertises a work\r\ngiving a complete account of his sayings and doings since the capitulation\r\nat Vilagos, including his flight to Turkey and his residence there, the\r\nnegotiations for his release, his journey from Kutahia to England, and his\r\ntarry there up to sailing for America, with a portrait.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE REV. HENRY T. CHEEVER’S _Life in the Sandwich Islands_ (noticed by us\r\nlately in the _International_), is reprinted in London, by Bentley, and\r\ntranslated in German for a publisher at Berlin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSILVIO PELLICO, so famous for his works, his imprisonments and sufferings,\r\nis passing the winter in Paris.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe complete works of CLEMENS BRENTANO, have been brought out at\r\nFrankfort, in seven volumes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo books of travels in Scandinavia have just appeared in Germany. One is\r\nthe _Bilder aus dem Norden_ (Pictures of the North), by Professor OSCAR\r\nSCHMIDT of Jena; and the other _Hägringar_, or a Journey through Sweden,\r\nLapland, Norway, and Denmark, in 1850, by a young author. Professor\r\nSchmidt amply repays the reader, which is more than can always be said of\r\nthe author of _Hägringar_. Both works are, however, especially worthy the\r\nattention of those who wish to study the natural history and ethnography\r\nof the countries in question.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMADAME VON WEBER, widow of the composer, who has for some years resided at\r\nVienna, has applied to the Emperor of Austria for permission to dispose of\r\nthe three original MSS. scores of her husband’s operas, _Der Freischütz,\r\nEutryanthe_, and _Oberon_. These were in the Royal Library at Vienna; and\r\nshe purposes offering them to the three sovereigns of Saxony, Prussia, and\r\nEngland,—in which respective countries they were originally produced. The\r\nEmperor has caused the MSS. to be delivered to her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROFESSOR NUYTZ, whose work on canon law was recently condemned by the\r\nHoly See, has resumed his lectures at Turin. The lecture-room was crowded,\r\nand the learned professor was received with loud applause. He adverted to\r\nthe hostility of the clergy, and to the Papal censures of his work, which\r\ncensures he declared to be in direct opposition to the rights of the civil\r\npower. He expressed his thanks to the ministry for having refused to\r\ndeprive him of his chair.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA valuable contribution to Italian history is _Die Carafa von Maddaloni,\r\nNeapel unter Spanische Herrschaft_ (Naples under Spanish Domination), just\r\npublished in Germany, by ALFRED VON REUMONT, a member of the Prussian\r\nLegation at Florence, who, more than almost any other man, has made a\r\nstudy of the history of that part of Italy, and who in this work has had\r\naccess to a great mass of new documents. He writes as a monarchist, but\r\nhis facts may be relied on. The work is in two volumes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery body remembers the noise made in New-York some fifteen years since\r\nby the revelations of MARIA MONK. We notice a translation of her famous\r\ndisclosures advertised, with all sorts of trumpet blowing, in our German\r\npapers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAn edition of the complete works of KEPLER is preparing in Germany, under\r\nthe supervision of Prof. FRISCH, of Stuttgart. The manuscripts of the\r\ngreat astronomer, preserved at St. Petersburg, have been examined for the\r\npurpose, with rich results. It is also proposed to erect a monument to\r\nKepler at Stuttgart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSixteen German books were prohibited in Russia in August last; among them\r\nwere FONTAINE’S _Poems_, GÖRRE’S _Christian Mysticism_, KUTZ’S _Manual of\r\nSacred History_, SCHMIDT’S _Death of Lord Byron_, KINKEL’S _Truth without\r\nPoetry_, and STRAUSS’S _Life Questions_. Of eleven other works, a few\r\npages from each were prohibited; among these was the German version of\r\nLieutenant LYNCH’S _United States Expedition to the Jordan and the Dead\r\nSea_. These works are allowed to enter Russia after having the\r\nobjectionable pages cut out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe science of landscape gardening is enriched by a new work of value just\r\npublished at Leipzig, by RUDOLPH LIEBECK, the director of the public\r\ngarden in that city. It is called _Die bildenden Garten Kunst in seinen\r\nModernen Formen_ (The Modern Constructive Art of Gardening). It has twenty\r\ncolored plates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOTTA, of Stuttgart, is preparing to publish a splendid illustrated\r\nedition of Goethe’s _Faust_. The designs are to be by an artist well known\r\nin Germany, Engelbert Seibertz. The work is to be published in numbers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe historical remains and letters of George Spalatin have been published\r\nat Weimar. They are a valuable addition to the history of the Reformation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable that the only oriental nation whose literature has much\r\nresemblance to ours, and has a direct practical value for us, is the\r\nChinese. For instance, the works of this people upon agriculture abound in\r\npractical information, which may be made immediately useful in Europe and\r\nAmerica. We noticed, some time since, the treatise on the raising and care\r\nof silk worms, translated and published at Paris, by M. STANISLAS JULIEN,\r\nwhich was so warmly welcomed in France as a timely addition to what was\r\nthere known upon the subject. It seems that this work was but a small\r\nportion of an extensive Cyclopedia of Agriculture in use in China, where\r\nthe science of tilling the soil has in many respects been developed to an\r\nastonishing degree of perfection. This cyclopedia, M. Hervey, a French\r\nscholar, whose knowledge of the Eastern languages is accompanied by an\r\nequally profound love of farming, has undertaken to translate entire. This\r\nis a difficult and tedious enterprise, especially on account of the mass\r\nof botanical and technical expressions which occur in the work, and of\r\nwhich the dictionaries furnish no explanation. Meanwhile M. Hervey has\r\npublished some of the results of his studies in a work called\r\n_Investigations on Agriculture and Gardening among the Chinese_. He\r\nmentions several varieties of fruits, vegetables, and trees, which might\r\nadvantageously be introduced into France and Algiers; he also analyzes the\r\nCyclopedia, and shows what are the difficulties in translating it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA remarkable contribution to our knowledge of China, is M. BIOT’s recent\r\ntranslation of the book called _Tscheu-li_. It seems that in the twelfth\r\ncentury before Christ, the second dynasty that had ruled the country, that\r\nof _Thang_, fell by its own vices, and the empire passed into the hands of\r\nWu-wang, the head of the princely family of _Tscheu-li_. Wu-wang was a\r\ngreat soldier and statesman; he confided to his brother Tscheu-Kong, a man\r\nevidently of extraordinary political genius, the moral and administrative\r\nreformation of the empire. He first laid the foundation of a reform in\r\nmoral ideas by an addition to the Y-King or sacred book, which the Chinese\r\nrevere and incessantly study, but which still remains an unintelligible\r\nmystery for Europeans. Of his administrative reforms a complete record is\r\npreserved in the _Tscheu-li_, and nothing could be easier to understand.\r\n\r\nWhen the Tscheus thus came into power, they found in existence a powerful\r\nfeudal aristocracy, from which they themselves proceeded, and which they\r\nmust tolerate. Accordingly, they recognized within the imperial dominions\r\nsixty-three federal jurisdictions, which were hereditary, but whose rulers\r\nwere obliged to administer according to the laws and methods of the\r\nempire. Having made this concession, they abolished all other hereditary\r\noffices, and established instead, a vast system of centralization, such as\r\nthe world has never seen equalled elsewhere. The administration, according\r\nto the _Tscheu-li_, is divided among six ministries, which were also\r\ndivided into sections, and the executive functions descend regularly and\r\nsystematically to the lowest official, and include the entire movement of\r\nsociety. The emperor and the feudal princes are restrained by formalities\r\nand usage, as well as by the expression of disapprobation; and the\r\nofficials of every grade by their hierarchical dependency, and by a system\r\nof incessant oversight; and finally, the people by proscription, and the\r\neducation, industrial, as well as mental and moral, which the State\r\ndispenses to them. The sole idea in which this astonishing system rests,\r\nis that of the State, whose office is to care for all that can contribute\r\nto the public good, and which regulates the action of every individual\r\nwith a view to this end. In his organization, Tscheu-Kong excelled every\r\nthing that the most centralized governments of Europe have devised.\r\n\r\nThe Tscheu family remained in power for five centuries, and was finally\r\nbroken down by the feudal element they had preserved. But so deep was the\r\nimpress of Tscheu-Kong upon the nation, that after centuries of\r\nrevolutions and civil war, it returned to his institutions and principles,\r\nand it is by them and in a great degree in their exact forms, that China\r\nis now governed.\r\n\r\nIn form the _Tscheu-li_ is like an imperial almanac of our own times. It\r\nis, however, much more complete, because Tscheu-Kong gives in it a mass of\r\ndetailed instructions, in order to make the officials aware of their\r\nduties and the precise limits of their authority. Thus the work affords a\r\nquite exact picture of the social condition of China at that time. There\r\nis no other monument of antiquity with which it can be compared, except\r\nthe _Manus_, the Indian book of law. The difference is, that in China the\r\nintellectual activity was altogether political, and the public\r\norganization altogether imperial and political; while in India the mental\r\nactivity was metaphysical, and the public organization altogether\r\nmunicipal.\r\n\r\nThe translation of the _Tscheu_ was not published till after M. Biot’s\r\ndecease; it was brought out by his father, with the assistance of M.\r\nStanislas Julien.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe library of the famous Cardinal Mezzofanti is about to be sold, and the\r\ncatalogue is already printed—in Italian, of course. It is one of the most\r\nextensive and valuable collection of works in various languages ever made,\r\nand it is to be hoped that it may not be disposed of at the sale, but pass\r\nall together into some public library—that of some university would be\r\nmost appropriate. To indicate the contents of the catalogue, we give the\r\ntitles of the different parts: Books in Albanian or Epirotic, Arabic,\r\nArmenian, American (Indian dialects of Brazil, Mexico, Paraguay, Peru,\r\nUnited States), Bohemian, Chaldaic, Chinese (Cochin-Chinese, Trin-Chinese,\r\nJapanese), Danish (Swedish, Norwegian, Icelandic, Laplandic), Hebrew\r\n(Antique, Rabbinic, Samaritan), Egyptian, or Coptic-Egyptian and Coptic,\r\nArabic, Etrusean, Phœnician, Flemish, French (Breton-French,\r\nLorraine-French, Provençal), Gothic and Visi-Gothic, and Greek and\r\nGreek-Latin, Modern Greek, Georgian or Iberian, Cretian or Rhetian,\r\nIllyrian, Indo-oriental (Angolese, Burmese or Avian, Hindostanee, Malabar,\r\nMalayan, Sanscrit), English (Arctic, Breton or Celtic, Scotch-Celtic,\r\nScotch, Irish, Welch), Italian (Fineban dialect, Maltese, Milanese,\r\nSardinian, Sicilian), Kurdistanee or Kurdic, Latin, Maronite and Syriac\r\nMaronite, Oceanic (Australian), Dutch, Persian, Polish, Portuguese\r\n(various dialects), Slavonian (Carniolan, Serbian, Ruthenian,\r\nSlavo-Wallachian), Syriac, Spanish (Catalan, Biscayan), Russian, Turkish,\r\nHungarian, Gipsey.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe French historian MICHELET, deprived of his professorship in the\r\nCollege of France, is devoting himself more than ever to literature. His\r\nlast work, of which an authorized translation has just appeared in London,\r\nis _The Martyrs of Russia_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMICHEL NICOLAS, one of the ablest among the French theologico-ethical\r\nwriters, has published a translation of the _Considerations on the Nature\r\nand Historical Developments of Christian Philosophy_, by Dr. RITTER, of\r\nthe University of Gottingen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nM. SCHONENBERGER, a music-publisher at Paris, has purchased from the heirs\r\nof Paganini the copyright of his works, and is now publishing them, under\r\nthe editorial supervision of M. ACHILLE PAGANINI, the son of the great\r\nviolinist. The edition will comprise every thing that he left behind in\r\nwriting. Hector Berlioz speaks with enthusiasm in the _Journal des Debats_\r\nof the two grand concertos which have just appeared, one of them\r\ncontaining the marvellous rondo of the _campanella_. Berlioz speaks in\r\nhigh praise of Paganini’s genius as a composer. A volume would be\r\nrequired, he says, to indicate the new effects, the ingenious methods, the\r\ngrand and noble forms which he discovered, and even the orchestral\r\ncombinations, which before him were not suspected. In spite of the rapid\r\nprogress which, thanks to Paganini, the violin is making at the present\r\nday in respect of mechanical execution, his compositions are yet beyond\r\nthe skill of most violinists, and in reading them it is hardly possible to\r\nconceive how their author was able to execute them. Unfortunately he was\r\nnot able to transmit to his successors the vital spark which animated and\r\nrendered _human_ those astonishing prodigies of mechanism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nM. PHILARETE CHASLES, one of the literary critics of the _Journal des\r\nDebats_, has published, at Paris, a book called _Etudes sur la Litterateur\r\net les Mæurs des Anglo-Americanis_, which abounds in those curious\r\nblunders that some French authors seem to be destined to when they write\r\nupon topics connected with foreign countries. For instance, he makes the\r\npilgrims of Plymouth to have been the founders of Philadelphia, New-York,\r\nand Boston. Buffalo he sets down opposite to Montreal, speaks of the\r\npuritans of Pennsylvania as near neighbors of Nova Scotia, and extends\r\nArkansas to the Rocky Mountains. At New-York his regret is that a railroad\r\nhas destroyed the beauty of Hoboken, and at New Orleans he laments that\r\nmarriages between whites and Creoles are interdicted. Of Cooper, Irving,\r\nBryant, Audubon, and Longfellow, he speaks in terms of just praise, but\r\nWillis is not mentioned. Bancroft and Hildreth are mentioned as\r\nhistorians, Prescott is spoken of briefly in connection with his Ferdinand\r\nand Isabella, while his other works are not alluded to. To Herman\r\nMelville, M. Chasles devotes fifty pages, while Mr. Ticknor has not even\r\nthe honor of a mention. The author of this work is very far from doing\r\njustice either to American literature or to himself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFive of the nine intended volumes of LAFUENTE’S _General History of Spain_\r\nfrom the remotest times to the present day, have appeared in Paris.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Paris a new edition is announced of the best French versions of\r\nFENIMORE COOPER’S works—six or eight illustrated volumes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nM. GUIZOT is about to publish a new volume at Paris, with the title of\r\n_Shakspeare et son Temps_ (Shakspeare and his Times). It is to be composed\r\nof his Life of Shakspeare, and the articles that he has written at various\r\ntimes upon different plays. The only novelty in it is a notice on Hamlet\r\nwhich was prepared expressly for this publication. He regards both Macbeth\r\nand Othello as better dramas than Hamlet, but thinks the last contains\r\nmore brilliant examples of Shakspeare’s sublimest beauties and grossest\r\nfaults. \"Nowhere,\" says Guizot, \"has he unveiled with more originality,\r\ndepth and dramatic effect, the inmost state of a great soul: but nowhere\r\nhas he more abandoned himself to the caprices, terrible or burlesque, of\r\nhis imagination, and to that abundant intemperance of a mind pressed to\r\nget out its ideas without choosing among them, and bent on rendering them\r\nstriking by a strong, ingenious, and unexpected mode of expression,\r\nwithout any regard to their truth and natural form.\" The French critic\r\nalso thinks that on the stage the effect of Hamlet is irresistible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA Capital work on Paris has just been published at Berlin, from the pen of\r\nFRIEDRICH SZARVADY, a Hungarian, who has resided for several years in\r\nParis. The titles of the chapters are:—Paris in Paris; Strangers in Paris;\r\nParisian Women; Street Eloquence; the Temple of Jerusalem (the Bourse);\r\nSalons and Conversation; Dancing, Song, and Flowers; the Ball at the Grand\r\nOpera; Artist Life; the Press; the Feuilleton; History on a Public Square;\r\nLamartine, Cavaignac, Thiers; Louis Bonaparte. Szarvady observes sharply,\r\nand writes with as much grace and _esprit_ as a Frenchman. Nothing can be\r\nmore taking than his pages. They deserve a translation from the German\r\ninto English.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVILLERGAS, the Spanish historian, who in one of his recent works drew a\r\nparallel between Espartero and Narvaez which excited great attention at\r\nMadrid and in other parts of Spain, has just been condemned by the court\r\nwhich has charge of the offences of the press, to a fine of twenty\r\nthousand reals, or twenty-five hundred dollars, for the sin against public\r\norder and private character contained in that parallel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAn interesting and valuable series of articles reviewing historically the\r\nsystems of land tenure which have prevailed in different countries, is\r\nappearing in the _Journal des Débats_ from the pen of M. HENRY TRIANON.\r\nThe systems of India and China have already been examined.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe termagant wife of Sir Edward Bulwer Lytton has just published _The\r\nSchool for Husbands_, a novel founded on the life and times of Moliere.\r\nProbably her own husband is shot at in all the chapters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe books on modern French history would already fill an Alexandrian\r\nlibrary, and every month produces new ones. M. LEONARD GALLOIS, a\r\nwell-known historical writer, announces a _History of the Revolution of\r\nFebruary, 1848_, in _five_ large octavos, with forty-one portraits. M.\r\nBARANTE’s _History of the Convention_ will consist of six octavos, of\r\nwhich three are published, and the last is accompanied by it biographical\r\nsketch of each of the seven hundred and fifty members. The period embraced\r\nin this work is from 1792 to 1795, inclusive. There is a new _History of\r\nthe City of Lyons_, in three octavos, by the city librarian.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe _Letters and unpublished Essays of Count_ JOSEPH DE MAISTRE have been\r\nbrought out at Paris, in two volumes octavo. The letters show the\r\ncelebrated author in a new and pleasing light; a tone of genial unreserve\r\nprevails in many of them, which those who have become familiar with his\r\nbrilliant, dogmatic, and paradoxical intellect, in his more elaborate\r\nwritings, would hardly suppose him capable of. No writer, of this century\r\nat least, has more powerfully set forth the doctrines of the Roman\r\nCatholic Church than he.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe _Political Situation of Cuba_, a volume published in Paris, by Don\r\nANTONIO SACO, is commended in the _Revue des Deux Mondes_. Don Antonio was\r\none of the most distinguished intelligences and liberals of the precious\r\nisland: he argues against independence, or annexation to the American\r\nUnion: he suggests various arrangements by which Spain could safely\r\nestablish political freedom in Cuba, and he thinks administrative and\r\njudicial reforms to counteract the worst ills of her present situation,\r\nmight be accomplished.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA New edition of SHARON TURNER’s _History of the Anglo-Saxons_ has just\r\nappeared in London, with important additions and revision. The first\r\nedition of Turner’s History was published in London more than fifty years\r\nago. At the time when the first volume appeared, the subject of\r\nAnglo-Saxon antiquities had been nearly forgotten by the British public,\r\nalthough the most venerated laws, customs, and institutions of the nation\r\noriginated before the Norman conquest. The Anglo-Saxon manuscripts lay\r\nunexamined in archives, and the important information they contained had\r\nnever been made a part of general history. Mr. Turner undertook a careful\r\nand patient investigation of all the documents belonging to the period\r\npreserved in the kingdom, and the result of his labors was the work in\r\nquestion, which at once gave rise to an almost universal passion for the\r\nrecords and remains of the Anglo-Saxon people, and called forth general\r\napplause from the best minds of England. A good edition of his History was\r\npublished several years ago by Carey and Hart of Philadelphia, but it is\r\nnow, we believe, out of print.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Rev. JOHN HOWARD HINTON, author of a well-known History of the United\r\nStates, has published, in London, a volume under the title of _The Test of\r\nExperience_, in which he has presented a masterly argument for the\r\nvoluntary principle in matters of religion. The \"test of experience\" is in\r\nthis, as in all other things, the best of tests, and the religious\r\ninstitutions of the United States can well bear its application. One of\r\nthe most noticeable results of the non-interference of the State is\r\npointed out in the following passage:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"To travellers in the United States, no fact has been more\r\n    immediately or more powerfully striking than the total absence of\r\n    religious rivalry. Amidst such a multitude of sects, an inhabitant\r\n    of the old world naturally, and almost instinctively looks for one\r\n    that sets up exclusive pretensions and possesses an actual\r\n    predominance. But he finds nothing of the kind. Neither\r\n    presbyterianism, or prelacy, nor any other form of\r\n    ecclesiasticism, makes the slightest effort to lift its head above\r\n    its fellow. And with the resignation of exclusive pretensions, the\r\n    entire ecclesiastical strife has ceased, and the din of angry war\r\n    has been hushed; and here, at length, the voluntary principle is\r\n    able to exhibit itself in its true colors, as a lover of peace and\r\n    the author of concord. It is busied no longer with the arguing of\r\n    disputed claims, but throws its whole energy into free and\r\n    combined operations for the extension of Christianity. The general\r\n    religious energy embodies itself in a thousand forms; but while\r\n    there is before the church a vast field to which the activities of\r\n    all are scarcely equal, there is, also, ’a fair field and no\r\n    favor,’—a field in which all have the same advantages, and in\r\n    which each is sure to find rewards proportionate to its wisdom and\r\n    its zeal. This inestimable benefit of religious peace is clearly\r\n    due to the voluntary principle.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJUNIUS, since the publication of his Letters, never figured more\r\nconspicuously than during the last month. The _Paris Revue des Deux\r\nMondes_ has a very long article on the great secret by M. Charles Remusat,\r\na member of the Institute, well known in historical criticism. He arrays\r\nskilfully the facts and reasonings which British inquirers have adduced in\r\nfavor of Sir Philip Francis, and the other most probable author, Lord\r\nGeorge Sackville. He seems to incline to the latter, but does not decide.\r\nHe pronounces that, on the whole, Junius was not \"a great publicist.\" His\r\npowers and influence are investigated and explained by M. de Remusat with\r\nacuteness and comprehensive survey. Lord Mahon, in his new volumes, says,\r\n\"From the proofs adduced by others, and on a clear conviction of my own, I\r\naffirm that the author of Junius was no other than Sir Philip Francis.\" We\r\nthink not. The London _Athenæum_, last year, we thought, settled this\r\npoint. It is understood that the editor of the _Grenville Papers_, now on\r\nthe eve of publication, in London, is in favor of Lord Temple as a\r\nclaimant for the authorship of Junius. The January number of the\r\n_Quarterly Review_ contains an article on the subject.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe _Natural History of the Human Species_, by Lieutenant-Colonel CHARLES\r\nHAMILTON SMITH, is the title of a duodecimo volume from the press of Gould\r\n& Lincoln of Boston. An American editor (Dr. Kneeland) has added an\r\nintroductory survey of recent literature on the subject. The whole\r\nperformance is feeble. The author and his editor endeavor to make out\r\nsomething like the infidel theory of Professor AGASSIZ, which, a year or\r\ntwo ago, attracted sufficient attention to induce an investigation and an\r\nintelligent judgment, in several quarters, as to the real claims of that\r\nperson to the distinctions in science which his advertising managers claim\r\nfor him. We have not space now for any critical investigation of the work,\r\nand therefore merely warn that portion of our readers who feel any\r\ninterest in ethnological studies, of its utter worthlessness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAn Englishman, Mr. FRANCIS BONYNGE, recently from the East Indies, has\r\ncome to this country at the instance of our minister in London, for the\r\npurpose of bringing before us the subject of introducing some twenty of\r\nthe most valuable agricultural staples of the East, among which are the\r\ntea, coffee, and indigo plants, into the United States. He gives his\r\nreasons for believing that tea and indigo would become articles of export\r\nfrom this country to an amount greater than the whole of our present\r\nexports. He says that tea, for which we now pay from sixty-five to one\r\nhundred cents per lb. may be produced for from two to five cents, free\r\nfrom the noxious adulterations of the tea we import. He has published a\r\nsmall volume under the title of _The Future Wealth of America_, in which\r\nhis opinions are fully explained and illustrated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first volume of a work on _Christian Iconography_, by M. DIDRON, of\r\nParis, opens to the curious reader a new source of intellectual enjoyment,\r\nboth in the department of ancient religious art, and in the archæology of\r\nthe early paintings of the Catholic Church. The rich, profuse, and quaint\r\nplates of the original work are used in a translation ably made by E.J.\r\nMillington, published in London by Bohn, and in New-York by Bangs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR FRANCIS BOND HEAD, so well known in this country as one of the former\r\ngovernors of Canada, and as an author of remarkable versatility and\r\ncleverness, has published an agreeable but superficial book on Paris—the\r\nParis of January, 1852—under the quaint title of _A Bundle of French\r\nSticks_; and Mr. Putnam has reprinted it in his new library.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA remarkable book published in Louisville, Kentucky, in 1847, by J. D.\r\nNOURSE, under the title of _Remarks on the Past, and its Legacies to\r\nAmerican Society_, has just been reprinted in London, with an introduction\r\nby D. T. COULTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following works, all of which have promising titles, will soon be\r\npublished by J. S. REDFIELD: _Men of the Times in 1852_, comprising\r\nbiographical sketches of all the celebrated men of the present day;\r\n_Characters in the Gospels_, by Rev. E. H. Chapin; _Tales and Traditions\r\nof Hungary_, by Theresa Pulzky; _The Comedy of Love_, and the _History of\r\nthe Eighteenth Century_, by Arsene Houssaye; Aytoun’s _Lays of the\r\nScottish Cavaliers_; _The Cavaliers of England_, and _The Knights of the\r\nOlden Time, or the Chivalry of England, France and Spain_, by Henry W.\r\nHerbert; _Lectures and Miscellanies_, by Henry James; and _Isa: a\r\nPilgrimage_, by Caroline Chesebro.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Westminster Review_ says of ALICE CAREY, whose _Clovernook_ we\r\nnoticed favorably in the last _International_, that \"no American woman can\r\nbe compared to her for genius;\" the Paris _Débats_ refers to her as a poet\r\nof the rank of Mrs. ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING in England; the literary\r\ncritic of _The Tribune_ (the learned and accomplished RIPLEY whose\r\njudgment in such a matter is beyond appeal) prefers her _Clovernook_ to\r\nMiss MITFORD’S _Our Village_, or Professor WILSON’S _Lights and Shadows of\r\nScottish Life_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. DANIEL S. CURTISS has availed himself well of large opportunities for\r\npersonal observation, in his volume just published under the title of\r\n_Western Portraiture, and Emigrant’s Guide_, a description of Wisconsin,\r\nIllinois, and Iowa, with remarks on Minnesota and other territories. It is\r\nthe most judicious and valuable book of the kind we have seen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHERR FREUND, the Philologist, is in London, engaged in constructing a\r\nGerman-English and English-German dictionary upon his new system; and\r\nProfessor SMITH, the learned editor of the Dictionary of Greek and Roman\r\nAntiquities, announces a dictionary of Greek and Roman Geography, the\r\narticles to be written by the principal contributors to his previous\r\nworks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CHRISTMAS BOOKS of the present season in England have not been very\r\nremarkable. Mr. DICKENS, in an extra number of his Household Words,\r\nprinted _What Christmas is to Everybody_; and we have from WILKIE COLLINS,\r\n_A New Christmas Story_; by the author of \"The Ogilvies,\" _Alice Learmont,\r\na Fairy Tale of Love_; by the author of \"The Maiden Aunt,\" a pleasant\r\nlittle book entitled _The Use of Sunshine_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUnder the title of _Excerpta de P. Ovidii Nastonis_, Blanchard & Lea of\r\nPhiladelphia have published a series of selections from a poet whose\r\nworks, for obvious reasons, are not read entire in the schools. The\r\nextracts present some of the most beautiful parts of this graceful and\r\nversatile poet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FINE ARTS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe American Art Unions have not been successful in the last year, unless\r\nan exception may be made in regard to that of New England, at Boston. The\r\nAmerican, at New-York, deferred indefinitely its annual distribution of\r\npictures, on account of the small number of its subscriptions; and the\r\nPennsylvanian, at Philadelphia, by a recent fire in that city has lost its\r\nadmirably-engraved plates of Huntington’s pictures from the _Pilgrim’s\r\nProgress_, the last of which was just completed and placed in the hands of\r\nthe printer. It will make no distribution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA Sicilian artist, residing at Naples, has amused himself, and probably\r\npleased his sovereign, by composing a life-sized group, representing\r\nReligion supporting King Ferdinand, and guarded by an angel, who places\r\nhis foot on an evil spirit. On the other side of this group is a child\r\nbearing the scales of justice. \"How much,\" writes a correspondent of the\r\n_Athenæum_, \"the artist is to get for this plaster blasphemy, I know not;\r\nbut a more impudent caricature (at the present moment) it would be\r\ndifficult to imagine.\" Another artist has, however, beaten the Sicilian\r\nsculptor quite out. A small bronze group represents Religion triumphing\r\nover Impiety and Anarchy. Impiety is represented by a female figure, under\r\nwhose arm are two books inscribed Voltaire and Luther! Anarchy has taken\r\noff her mask, and let fall two scrolls, on which are written _Communismo_\r\nand _Constituto_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROFESSOR ZAHN, who has been engaged during a period of more than twenty\r\nyears in examining the ruins of Pompeii and Herculaneum, has exhibited at\r\nBerlin a collection of casts unique in their kind. These are 8,000 in\r\nnumber; and comprise all the remarkable sculptures of the above places,\r\nbesides those found at Stabiæ, and those of the vast collection of the\r\nMuseo Borbonico and other museums of the Two Sicilies. The casts from the\r\nMuseo Borbonico are the first ever made,—the King of Naples having\r\naccorded the privilege of taking these copies to M. Zahn alone, in royal\r\nrecompense for the Professor’s great work on Pompeii and Herculaneum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA book which all students of art should possess, is DR. KUGLER’S\r\n_Geschichte der Kunst_ (History of Art), with the Illustrations\r\n(_Bilderatlos_) which accompany it, and which are now being published at\r\nStuttgart. The ancient and modern schools of Art—Painting, Sculpture, and\r\nArchitecture—are here represented in outlines of their most celebrated and\r\ncharacteristic works. Eleven numbers of these Illustrations have appeared,\r\nand the whole work will be completed in the course of the coming year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn our musical world there have been several noticable facts in the last\r\nmonth. The opera company, perhaps from the utter incapacity of its\r\ndirector, has been divided, and the best portion of it has been singing at\r\nNiblo’s Theatre. Jenny Lind’s farewell series of concerts was prevented by\r\nintelligence of the death of the great singer’s mother, in Sweden.\r\nCatherine Hayes has been successful in several concerts at Tripler Hall,\r\nand Mrs. Bostwick, whom the best critics of the city regard as superior to\r\nany singer who has appeared among us, except Jenny Lind, has given a\r\nsecond series of her subscription concerts, which were extremely well\r\nattended.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA correspondent of the _Athenæum_, writing from Egypt, urges that a few\r\nyoung artists should be sent out with orders to copy all the hieroglyphics\r\non the most important temples, as well as the numerous tablets and\r\nfragments which are daily brought to light. \"A work pursued with such\r\nmaterials—all theories and arbitrary classification being excluded—would\r\never remain as a lasting monument, and would reflect great credit on the\r\nGovernment which should order its execution.\" Less than one-half of the\r\nmoney required for the removal of the Obelisk would amply cover all\r\nexpenses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA correspondent of _Kuhne’s Europa_ writes from Dresden that a number of\r\nhumorous drawings, sketched by the pencil of Schiller, and accompanied by\r\ndescriptions in his own hand, have been found in the possession of a\r\nSwabian family, with whom the great poet became acquainted during his\r\nresidence at Loschwitz.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Berlin, M. von Prinz, a pupil of Kiss, the sculptor, is erecting a\r\ngroup which he calls _The Lion-killer_ in imitation of the _Amazon_. Kiss\r\nhimself is engaged on a set of groups from a fox-hunt, Rauch has almost\r\ncompleted a bust of Humboldt, and statues of General Gneisenau and of\r\n_Hope_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA colossal statue of the Emperor Napoleon, thirty feet high, is to be\r\nplaced on the top of the Triumphal Arch, at the end of the Champs Elysées,\r\nin Paris.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKAULBACH has undertaken to draw a set of sketches for an illustrated\r\nedition of Shakspeare, which will shortly be published by Nicolai, At\r\nBerlin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. GREENOUGH, is now in New-York, awaiting the arrival of his splendid\r\ngroup for the Capitol, from Italy. He will soon be engaged on his statue\r\nof his friend the late Mr. Cooper, to be erected in this city.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORICAL REVIEW OF THE MONTH\r\n\r\n\r\nThe extraordinary abilities of Kossuth as orator, hid attractive personal\r\nqualities, and grandeur of his propositions, continue to occupy the\r\ngenerous regard of the people of the United States, but the impression\r\nwhich obtained at one time that the national government would in any\r\nmanner or degree enter into his plans for confining a future contest for\r\nthe liberty of Hungary exclusively to the two parties most immediately\r\ninterested, appears to have been very generally given up. This country\r\nwill continue to encourage and aid oppressed peoples by showing how wisely\r\nand efficiently its servants can attend to her own affairs. At the same\r\ntime it is not to be doubted that citizens in their private capacity may\r\nand will do much for the illustrious exile who pleads among us for the\r\nmeans of opposing the oppressors of his nation. Kossuth has been\r\nentertained at public banquets since he left New-York by the authorities\r\nof Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington, Annapolis, and Harrisburg; he has\r\nbeen received by the President of the United States, the two houses of\r\nCongress, and the legislatures of Maryland and Pennsylvania; and on the\r\n7th of January he dined with the representatives, senators, and other\r\npersons connected with the government, at Washington, and Daniel Webster,\r\nLewis Cass, William H. Seward, and Stephen A. Douglass, made speeches on\r\nthe occasion expressive of their personal respect and sympathy, and their\r\nanxiety as individuals to see Hungary independent. Mr. Cass indeed went so\r\nfar as entirely to endorse the doctrine of Kossuth respecting intervention\r\nto insure non-intervention. Kossuth is now in the state of Ohio, and he\r\nprobably will remain in this country long enough—since the French\r\nrevolution has at least deferred any great and united movement of the\r\nEuropean democracy—to visit all the principal cities of the valley of the\r\nMississippi.\r\n\r\nBut little important business has yet been accomplished in Congress,\r\nthough numerous bills have been introduced, as is usual in the early weeks\r\nof the session. On the morning of the 24th of December, a portion of the\r\ncapitol, occupied by the national library, was destroyed by fire, with\r\nnearly sixty thousand printed volumes, and many MSS., maps, medals,\r\nportraits, sculptures, and other works of art.\r\n\r\nThe legislature of several of the states are now in session. Those of\r\nOhio, Michigan, Mississippi, Wisconsin and California, met on the 5th of\r\nJanuary; those of New-York, Pennsylvania and Delaware, on the 7th; those\r\nof Maryland and Massachusetts, on the 7th; that of Indiana, on the 8th;\r\nthose of Virginia and Illinois, on the 12th; that of New Jersey, on the\r\n13th; that of Maine, on the 14th, and that of Louisiana, on the 19th. No\r\ngreat national questions have been prominently before the state\r\nlegislatures, except that of our foreign relations, with special reference\r\nto Hungary, upon which the assemblies in the several states appear to be\r\nless conservative than Congress. The most important subject of local\r\nadministration, is that of the suppression of the sales of intoxicating\r\nliquors. The law of Maine, enacted last year, will probably be sustained\r\nin that state; in Massachusetts a petition with more than one hundred\r\nthousand signatures, has been offered in the legislature for such a law,\r\nand similar efforts are being made in New-York and other States.\r\n\r\nIn Mexico there is a continuance of the imbecility of the government and\r\nthe agitations of factions. Rumors, constantly varying, in regard to the\r\nconduct and prospects of Caravajal, leave us in doubt whether any thing of\r\nreal importance will grow out of his attempts at revolution in the\r\nnorthern provinces. The administration appears to have acted with\r\ndecision, but probably with impotence so far as the final result is\r\nconcerned, in regard to the Tehuantepee railroad contract.\r\n\r\nSouth America presents the usual series of disturbances, with some facts\r\nwhich indicate a prospect of repose; but all such prospects in the Spanish\r\nstates of this continent are apt to be deceptive. The birthday of Bolivar\r\nwas celebrated at Caracas on the 28th of October with great public\r\nfestivities. Treaties between Brazil and Uruguay were formed for alliance,\r\nmilitary aid, commerce and navigation, and the mutual surrender of\r\ncriminals, on the 12th of October. We learn from Buenos Ayres that,\r\nthrough November, Rosas was making great preparations to meet Urquiza. He\r\nhad established a corps of observation in the direction of Entre Rios to\r\nlook out for an invasion. A considerable emigration was taking place from\r\nBuenos Ayres to Montevideo, mostly of previous residents of the latter\r\ncity.\r\n\r\nIn Great Britain the most important recent event is the retirement of Lord\r\nPalmerston from the cabinet, in which he held the place of Secretary of\r\nState for Foreign Affairs. This occurred on the 22d of December. The\r\ncauses of Lord Palmerston’s retirement are a subject of much\r\nunsatisfactory speculation, and the fact is generally regretted by the\r\nfriends of political liberty in Europe. His successor is Lord Granville, a\r\nnobleman of manly and liberal character, heretofore connected with the\r\ngovernment. It is apprehended that the popular feeling may induce the\r\nrecall of Lord Palmerston to be the head of a new Ministry. Great Britain\r\nhas now no envoy resident in the United States, but it is not improbable\r\nthat Sir Henry Bulwer will return to this country for the final settlement\r\nof affairs connected with Central America. It is understood officially\r\nthat the attack of a British man-of-war on the United States steamer\r\nPrometheus, at Greytown, was entirely unauthorized.\r\n\r\nThe Admiralty have determined not to send another expedition in search of\r\nSir John Franklin, by way of Behring’s Straits. The Plover is to be\r\ncommunicated with each year by a man-of-war—the Amphitrite is the next.\r\nThe proposed overland expedition of Lieut. Pym has been abandoned.\r\n\r\nThe English war at the Cape of Good Hope continues with little change,\r\nthough a few important successes by the English are reported. The war\r\nappears to be condemned by a large and respectable portion of the journals\r\nand the people at home. In its character and details it continues to\r\nresemble our own contest with the Indians in Florida.\r\n\r\nThe month of December, 1851, witnessed, in FRANCE, the successful\r\naccomplishment of a _coup d’état_ not less daring than any that marked the\r\nearlier annals of that country. It is asserted that the personal security\r\nof the President was menaced with imminent danger, when, on the evening of\r\nthe 1st of December, he came to the resolution to strike the first blow.\r\nThe measures he immediately took were, to issue an appeal to the people\r\ndenouncing the conduct of the Assembly, and declaring it dissolved; a\r\nproclamation to the army, telling them that \"to-day, at this solemn\r\nmoment, I wish the voice of the army to be heard;\" and a decree \"in the\r\nname of the French people,\" of which the articles were—\"1. The National\r\nAssembly is dissolved; 2. Universal Suffrage is re-established—the law of\r\nthe 31st May is abrogated; 3. The French people is convoked in its\r\nelective colleges from the 14th of December to the 21st of December\r\nfollowing; 4. The state of siege is decreed through the first military\r\ndivision; 5. The Council of State is dissolved; 6. The Minister of the\r\nInterior is charged with the execution of the present decree.\" The appeal\r\nto the people contained these further propositions; \"Persuaded that the\r\ninstability of power, that the preponderance of a single Assembly, are the\r\npermanent causes of trouble and discord. I submit to your suffrages the\r\nfundamental basis of a constitution which the Assemblies will develop\r\nhereafter—1. A responsible chief named for ten years; 2. The Ministers\r\ndependent on the executive alone; 3. A Council of State formed of the most\r\ndistinguished men, preparing the law, and maintaining the discussion\r\nbefore the legislative corps; 4. A legislative corps, discussing and\r\nvoting the laws, named by universal suffrage, without the _scrutin de\r\nliste_ which falsifies the election; 6. A second Assembly formed of all\r\nthe illustrious persons of the nation—a preponderating power, guardian of\r\nthe fundamental pact and of public liberty.\" At an early hour, on the 2d,\r\nthese manifestoes were found covering the walls of Paris, and at the same\r\ntime the principal thoroughfares were filled with troops of the line.\r\n\r\nThe President had taken precautions that the National Guard should not be\r\ncalled out. The Generals Changarnier, Cavaignac, Bedeau, Lamoricière,\r\nLeflo, Colonel Charras, MM. Bazé, Thiers. Brun, the Commissary of Police\r\nof the Assembly, and others of the leading heads of parties, were arrested\r\nbefore they had risen for the day. Many members of the Assembly gathered\r\nat the house of M. Daru, one of their Vice-Presidents and, having him at\r\ntheir head, proceeded to their ordinary place of meeting, but found access\r\neffectually barred by the Chasseurs de Vincennes, a corpse recently\r\nreturned from Algeria. These men forcibly withstood the entrance of the\r\nmembers, some of whom were slightly wounded. Returning with M. Daru, they\r\nwere invited by General Lauriston to the Marie of the 10th arrondissement,\r\nwhere they formed a sitting, presided over by two of their\r\nVice-Presidents, M. Vitel and M. Benuist d’Azy (M. Daru having meanwhile\r\nbeen arrested), and proceeded to frame a decree to the following effect:\r\n\"Louis Napoleon Bonaparte is deprived of his functions as President of the\r\nRepublic, and the citizens are commanded to refuse him obedience; the\r\nexecutive power passes in full right to the National Assembly; the judges\r\nof the High Court of Justice are required to meet immediately, on pain of\r\ndismissal, to proceed to judgment against the President and his\r\naccomplices. It is enjoined on all functionaries and depositaries of\r\nauthority that they obey the requisition made in the name of the Assembly,\r\nunder penalty of forfeiture and the punishment prescribed for high\r\ntreason.\" While this decree was being signed, another was unanimously\r\npassed, naming General Oudinot commander of the forces, and M. Tamisier\r\nchief of the staff. These decrees had scarcely been signed by all present,\r\nwhen a company of soldiers entered, and required them to disperse. The\r\nAssembly refused to do so, when, after some parley, two commissaries de\r\npolice were brought, the presidents were arrested, and the whole body of\r\nmembers present, 230 in number, were marched across the city to the\r\nbarracks of the Quai d’Orsay. The next day they were distributed to the\r\nprisons of Mount Valerien, Mazas, and Vincennes; and the generals\r\nCavaignac, Lamoricière, Bedeau, and Changarnier, were sent to Ham. During\r\nthe day the population viewed the soldiers in the streets merely as a\r\nspectacle, and no violent excitement occurred. At ten o’clock on Wednesday\r\nmorning some members of the Mountain appeared in the Rue d’Antoine, and\r\nraised the cry _Aux armes!_ The party they collected immediately began to\r\nerect a barricade at the corner of the Rue St. Marguerite. Troops were\r\nquickly at the spot, when the barricade was carried, and the\r\nrepresentative Baudin was killed. Some other barricades were raised in the\r\nafternoon, but as quickly destroyed. General Magnan, the\r\nCommander-in-chief of the army of Paris, seeing the day was passed in\r\ninsignificant skirmishes, now determined to withdraw his small posts, to\r\nallow the discontented to gather to a head. On the morning of the 4th it\r\nwas reported that the insurrection had its focus in the Quartiers St.\r\nAntoine, St. Denis, and St. Martin, and that several barricades were in\r\nprogress. The General deferred his attack until two o’clock, when the\r\nvarious brigades of troops acted in concert. The barricades were attacked\r\nin the first instance by artillery, and then carried at the point of the\r\nbayonet. There were none which offered very serious resistance, and the\r\nwhole contest was over about five o’clock. In the evening, however, fresh\r\nbarricades were raised in the Rues Montmartre and Montorgueil, and others\r\nin the Rues Pagevin and des Fosses Montmartre, which were successfully\r\nattacked in the night by the officers in command of those quarters. On the\r\n5th the last remains of street-fighting were effectually quelled. The loss\r\nto the military in these operations was twenty-five men killed, of whom\r\none was Lieut-Col. Loubeau, of the line, and 184 wounded, of whom\r\nseventeen were officers. The number of insurgents killed is unknown, but\r\nthey are estimated it from two to three thousand, including,\r\nunfortunately, many indifferent persons, who were accidentally passing\r\nalong the boulevards when the soldiery suddenly opened their sweeping\r\nfire. The insurgents taken with arms in their hands were carried to the\r\nChamp de Mars, and there shot by judgment of court martial. Most of the\r\npolitical prisoners arrested were discharged after a few days, some of the\r\nmore formidable only being longer detained.\r\n\r\nBy a decree of the President dated the 2d December, the French people were\r\nconvoked in their respective districts for the 14th of the month to accept\r\nor reject the following _plébiscite_: \"The French people wills the\r\nmaintenance of the authority of Louis Napoleon Bonaparte, and delegates to\r\nhim the powers necessary to frame a Constitution on the bases proposed in\r\nhis proclamation of the 2d December.\" On that day the voting consequently\r\ncommenced by universal suffrage; and the President has been re-elected for\r\nten years by a majority greatly exceeding that of his contest with\r\nCavaignac. In Paris, of 394,049 registered voters 197,091 have voted in\r\nthe affirmative; 95,511, in the negative; and 96,819 abstained from\r\nvoting. The majority for Louis Napoleon being 191,500. In the provinces he\r\nhas had a majority of eight to one. The inauguration of the usurper took\r\nplace in the church of Notre Dame on the 3d of January, and the new order\r\nof things has been recognized by all the courts of Europe.\r\n\r\nOn the 25th of November a French squadron appeared before Salee, to claim\r\nsatisfaction for an act of piracy committed by the inhabitants of that\r\ntown. The Caid asked for six days to take the orders of the Emperor of\r\nMorocco; and the Caid of Rabat sent a similar evasive reply. The next day\r\nthe French bombarded the place for seven hours, the fire being returned by\r\nboth forts of Rabat and Salee. The Admiral, however, confined his\r\nchastisement to the latter, which he thoroughly performed, and fired the\r\ntown in several places. The French fleet arrived at Tangier on the morning\r\nof the 29th, when the Consul-General for Morocco and several officers of\r\nthe squadron landed, and had an interview with the Bashaw of the province,\r\nwhich ended in a satisfactory arrangement, to the great relief of the\r\npeople of Tangier, who were in consternation at the prospect of sharing\r\nthe fate of their neighbors.\r\n\r\nFrom Austria we learn the partial amelioration in private business of the\r\nfinancial difficulties. The Emperor published, on the 1st of January,\r\ndecrees, that whereas the provisions of the constitution were cancelled by\r\nthe imperial edict of August 20, 1851, the last principles of political\r\nright conceded by the constitution are now disavowed. There now exists no\r\npolitical right in the empire. The Austrian government continues to watch\r\nwith the keenest anxiety the proceedings of the exiled Italians and\r\nHungarians, and by very stringent arrangements in regard to the press, and\r\nthe interdiction of most foreign journals, keeps the \"dangerous classes\"\r\nin ignorance of the sympathy with which they are regarded from abroad.\r\n\r\nThe Queen of Spain, by a spontaneous act of her royal clemency, granted a\r\npardon to all such prisoners, made in the last expedition against the Isle\r\nof Cuba, as are citizens of the United States, whether they be already in\r\nSpain, undergoing the punishments they have incurred, or whether they be\r\nstill in Cuba. The queen on the 20th of December gave birth to a princess,\r\nwho is heir to the throne.\r\n\r\nFrom China there are reports that the Emperor has been compelled to resign\r\nin favor of the revolutionary general, whose triumphant march through many\r\nrevolted provinces has, from time to time, been noticed in the last half\r\nyear. The statement, however, does not appear to be credited by some of\r\nthe best informed London journals.\r\n\r\nThe Queen of Madagascar is bent on exterminating Christianity in her\r\ndominions, and has long mercilessly persecuted those who prefer the \"new\r\nreligion.\" In the last outburst of this protracted persecution, four\r\npersons were burnt alive; fourteen precipitated from a high rock and\r\ncrushed to death; a hundred and seventeen persons condemned to work in\r\nchains as long as they live; twenty persons cruelly flogged with rods,\r\nbesides 1,748 other persons mulcted in heavy penalties, reduced into\r\nslavery, and compelled to buy themselves back, or deprived of their wives\r\nand families. Persons of rank have been degraded, and sent as forced\r\nlaborers to carry stone for twelve months together to build houses; and,\r\nin an endless variety of other ways have the maddened passions of one\r\nwicked woman been permitted now for years past to plunge a great country\r\nin ruin.\r\n\r\nThere has been a serious Mussulman riot at Bombay, occasioned by the\r\nParsee editor of an illustrated newspaper, in each number of which is\r\ngiven a life and portrait of some remarkable historical character, having\r\npublished—in the series (next to one of Benjamin Franklin)—a life and\r\nportrait of Mahomet. Both are said to have been unexceptionable according\r\nto European ideas, but the whole Mussulman population (145,000 in number)\r\nconsidered their faith insulted and outraged by the publication, holding\r\nit sacrilege and idolatry to imagine and print any likeness whatever of so\r\nsacred a personage.\r\n\r\nThe Wahabees, who inhabit the interior and highland portion of Arabia,\r\nhave pillaged the holy cities of Mecca and Medina, destroying the mosques,\r\nsacking the cities, and carrying off numbers of women and children into\r\nthe desert. It is supposed to be in revenge for the punishment inflicted\r\non them thirty years ago, when they had conquered the same cities.\r\n\r\nThe Turkish government has introduced the culture of cotton in the\r\nvicinity of Damascus, with seed procured from the United States. It is\r\nsuccessful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSCIENTIFIC DISCOVERIES AND PROCEEDINGS OF LEARNED SOCIETIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn London, among the scientific questions of a practical kind much\r\ndiscussed, is that of a patent process for contracting the fibres of\r\ncalico, and of obtaining on calico thus prepared colors of much\r\nbrilliancy. It is regarded by chemists as likely to lead to valuable\r\nresults. In the British Association, it was described as the discovery\r\nthat a solution of cold but caustic soda acts peculiarly on cotton fibre,\r\nimmediately causing it to contract; and although the soda can be readily\r\nwashed out, yet the fibre has undergone a change. Thus, taking a coarse\r\ncotton fabric, and acting upon it by the proper solution of caustic soda,\r\nthis could be made much finer in appearance; and if the finest calico made\r\nin England—known as one hundred and eighty picks to the web—be thus acted\r\non, it immediately appears as fine as two hundred and sixty picks.\r\nStockings of open weaving assume a much finer texture by the condensation\r\nprocess; but the effect of the alteration is most strikingly shown by\r\ncolors: the tint of pink cotton velvet becomes deepened to an intense\r\ndegree; and printed calicoes, especially with colors hitherto applied with\r\nlittle satisfaction—such as lilac—come out with strength and brilliancy,\r\nbesides producing fabrics finer than could be possibly woven by hand. The\r\nstrength, too, is increased by this process; for a string of calico which\r\nbreaks with a weight of thirteen ounces when not soaked, will bear twenty\r\nounces when half condensed by the caustic soda.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt a recent meeting of the Paris _Academy of Sciences_, M. YVART read an\r\nimportant practical Memoir on the production of Wool, in the Merino race.\r\nHe teaches that the only means of obtaining fine wool—taking into account\r\nthe weight of the sheep’s body,—is the employment of races of small size.\r\nWhen the skin is very delicate, it secretes less of wool than when it is\r\notherwise;—the fineness of the wool is proportioned to that of the skin.\r\nThose countries in which the winter is long or cold, or where the sheep\r\nremains in the fold the greater part of the year, and does not lie on\r\nploughed lands, are especially suited to the production of the finest and\r\nmost elastic wools, those chiefly sought after for manufacture of cloth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExperiments on the application of electro-magnetism as a motive power,\r\nhave been made with some striking results in Paris, as well as in this\r\ncountry. M. Dumont, in a paper on the subject submitted to the _Female\r\nAcademy_, states, \"that if in the production of great power the\r\nelectro-magnetic force is inferior to that of steam, it becomes equal to\r\nit, and perhaps superior in the production of small power, which may be\r\nsubdivided, varied, and introduced into employments or trades requiring\r\nbut little capital, and where the absolute value of the mechanical power\r\nis less essential than the facility of producing instantaneously and at\r\npleasure the power itself. In this point of view electro-magnetic power\r\ncomes to complete, not to supersede, that of steam.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the papers of the celebrated Lalande, recently presented to the Paris\r\n_Academy of Sciences_, by M. Arago, there is a note to the effect that so\r\nfar back as the 25th of October, 1800, he and Burckhardt were of opinion,\r\nfrom calculations, that there must be a planet beyond Uranus, and they\r\noccupied themselves for some time in trying to discover its precise\r\nposition. This is a very curious fact for astronomers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRECENT DEATHS.\r\n\r\n\r\nJOEL R. POINSETT, LL.D., long distinguished in society and in affairs,\r\ndied at his residence in Statesburg, South Carolina, on the 12th of\r\nDecember. The first American ancestor of Mr. Poinsett came to this country\r\nfrom Soubisi, near Rochelle, in France, soon after the revocation of the\r\nedict of Nantz. His father was a physician, and served in the Revolution\r\nunder Count Pulaski. He himself was born at Charleston on the second of\r\nMarch, 1779, and, after having passed some time at the school of the Rev.\r\nTimothy Dwight (afterward President of Yale College), at Greenfield,\r\nConnecticut, he was sent, at the close of the Revolution, to England, to\r\ncomplete his studies, and for the advantages of foreign travel. Returning\r\nin 1800, when he was twenty-one years of age, he commenced the study of\r\nlaw in the office of Mr. Desaussure, afterwards Chancellor of South\r\nCarolina, Before his admission to the bar, he again embarked for Europe,\r\nextending his travels to Switzerland, Bavaria, Austria, and the northern\r\ncountries of the continent. At St. Petersburg he became acquainted with\r\nthe Emperor Alexander, soon after his accession, and was received by him\r\nwith marked partiality, and often questioned respecting the peculiar\r\ninstitutions of this country. On one occasion, after he had been\r\nexpatiating at large on the advantages of America, the Czar exclaimed,\r\n\"Were I not an emperor, I would be a republican.\" Declining the offer of a\r\nplace in the service of the Emperor, he commenced a tour into the East,\r\ntravelling through Persia and Armenia, and, returning to Europe, resided\r\nfor some time in its principal capitals. On the breaking out of\r\ndifficulties between the United States and Great Britain, in 1808, he\r\nreturned to his own country, and applied to Mr. Madison for a commission\r\nin the army. Owing to some objections by the Secretary of War, he did not\r\nobtain the commission, but was sent by the President to South America, to\r\nascertain the result of the revolutions which had recently occurred in\r\nthat quarter. While in Chili, he heard of the declaration of war between\r\nEngland and America. Embarking in the frigate Essex, to return to this\r\ncountry, with a view to enter the army, he was made a prisoner on the\r\nsurrender of that vessel to the British by Commodore Porter. The British\r\nCommander refused to allow his return home with the rest of the prisoners,\r\nregarding him as a dangerous enemy of England, and he therefore determined\r\nto cross the continent to the Atlantic. He passed the Andes in the month\r\nof April, when they were covered with snow, and, after great difficulties,\r\nreached Buenos Ayres. He succeeded, in a Portuguese vessel, in reaching\r\nMadeira, where, on his arrival, he learned that a treaty of peace had been\r\nconcluded. Soon after he reached South Carolina, he was elected to the\r\nLegislature of that State, in which he devoted himself chiefly to the\r\nestablishment of a system of internal improvements. In 1821 he was elected\r\nto Congress, from the Charleston District, and was twice re-elected to\r\nthat body. In 1822, he was sent to Mexico, by President Monroe, to obtain\r\ninformation with regard to the government under Iturbide. He performed\r\nthis mission with signal success. Foreseeing the speedy downfall of the\r\nimperial administration, he gave his advice against all connection with\r\nit, on the part of this country. He had scarcely returned home, when\r\nIturbide abdicated the throne. Soon after the election of Mr. Adams, which\r\nhe had strongly opposed, Mr. Poinsett was again appointed Minister to\r\nMexico, whore he remained until the summer of 1829. His important services\r\nin this period are amply detailed in a memoir of his political life, in\r\nthe first volume of the _Democratic Review_, and were warmly approved in\r\nthe first annual message of President Jackson. On returning to the United\r\nStates, he devoted himself to the pursuits of private life, in South\r\nCarolina. When the States Rights controversy broke out, he again engaged\r\nin political affairs, and became a prominent advocate of the principles of\r\nthe Union party, as opposed to Nullification. In 1836, he was nominated by\r\nhis friends as a candidate for the State Senate, and was elected with but\r\nlittle opposition. On the formation of Mr. Van Buren’s cabinet, Mr.\r\nPoinsett accepted the office of Secretary of War. On the election of Gen.\r\nHarrison he retired to his home in South Carolina, where he devoted\r\nhimself to those literary pursuits which formed the pleasure of his life;\r\nand thence he issued, only two years ago, those stirring appeals against\r\nsecession, which were among the most powerful influences for the\r\npreservation of the endangered peace of the Union at that period. Mr.\r\nPoinsett received the degree of Doctor of Laws from Columbia College in\r\nthis city, and he was a member of many learned societies in this country,\r\nand in Europe. Besides his _Notes on Mexico_, written soon after his last\r\nreturn from that country, he published several addresses, was a large\r\ncontributor to the _Southern Quarterly Review_ and other periodicals, and\r\nfurnished some important papers to the Paris Geographical Society, and\r\nother learned associations abroad and at home.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMOSES STUART, D.D., of the Theological Seminary at Andover, died at his\r\nresidence in that town on the 4th of January, in the seventy-second year\r\nof his age. He was born in Wilton, Conn., March 16, 1780; was graduated at\r\nYale College in 1799; and was a tutor in that institution from 1802 to\r\n1804. After having studied the profession of the law, he turned his\r\nattention to theology, and in 1806 was ordained pastor of the Central\r\nCongregational church in New Haven. He was called to the Professorship of\r\nSacred Literature in Andover Theological Seminary in 1810, and continued\r\nfor nearly forty years to discharge its important duties. Professor Stuart\r\nwas a man of great natural abilities, honorable principles, and a strong\r\nwill; for a long period he occupied the first place among cultivators of\r\nsacred learning in this country; and though younger men, with larger\r\nopportunities, have recently attained to greater eminence, no one in the\r\nsame field has ever exercised a more important and advantageous influence.\r\nHis first considerable work was a _Hebrew Grammar_, published in 1823. It\r\nscarcely deserves comparison with the more celebrated performance of\r\nGesenius, of which Professor Stuart himself gave to the public a\r\ntranslation, more than twenty years after the publication of his own work;\r\nbut for some time after its original appearance it was the best Hebrew\r\nGrammar in the English language. In 1825 he was associated with Professor\r\nRobinson in the production of a _Greek Grammar of the New Testament_; in\r\n1827 he published his _Commentary on the Epistle to the Hebrews_; in 1829\r\nhis _Hebrew Chrestomathy_, and in 1830 his _Course of Hebrew Study_. His\r\nCommentary on the Hebrews, was received as an accession to the body of\r\npermanent theological literature. It was spoken of in England as \"the most\r\nvaluable philological aid\" that had been published \"for the critical study\r\nof that important, and in many respects difficult book;\" and the late Dr.\r\nPye Smith, one of the first biblical, theological, and classical scholars\r\nin Great Britain, stated, that he felt it to be his duty to describe it as\r\n\"the most important present to the cause of sound biblical interpretation\r\nthat had ever been made in the English language.\" In Germany also it\r\nsecured for Professor Stuart the highest consideration; and it continues\r\nin all countries to be regarded as one of the noblest examples of\r\nphilological theology and exegetical criticism. In 1832 Professor Stuart\r\npublished another great work of a similar character: his _Commentary on\r\nthe Epistle to the Romans_. It was distinguished for a profoundness of\r\nresearch, for an intensity and minuteness of philological labor, and a\r\nsingleness of purpose to arrive at the meaning of the apostle, without\r\nregard to any preconceived or partisan opinions, which obtained for it a\r\nregard as an authority equal to that awarded to its predecessor. In 1845\r\nhe published a _Commentary on the Apocalypse_; a profoundly learned and\r\ncritical work, in which the interpretation of this difficult book varies\r\nmuch from that which has been most generally received. In the same year he\r\nalso gave to the church a _Critical History and Defence of the Old\r\nTestament Canon_. His devotion to biblical criticism continued to the\r\nclose of his life, and we believe, his last use of the pen was in the\r\ncorrection of the concluding sheets of a volume of Commentaries.\r\n\r\nIn his later years Professor Stuart entered into political controversies,\r\nand was particularly distinguished for his defence of the policy of Mr.\r\nWebster, in a pamphlet entitled _Conscience and the Constitution_. He also\r\nventured very injudiciously into the field of classical criticism, in an\r\nedition of _Cicero_, which was sharply reviewed by Professor Kingsley of\r\nYale College; and he lost reputation in his more legitimate sphere by a\r\ncontroversy with Professor Conant, of Madison University, growing out of\r\nhis translation of the _Hebrew Grammar of Gesenius_. It is not to be\r\ndenied that in measuring his strength against that of these accomplished\r\nscholars, he was signally unfortunate.\r\n\r\nIn his personal character he was simple, sincere, enthusiastic, brave, and\r\nreligious. He was well entitled to the great respect in which he was held\r\nby the church. He had been ordained for high services, and he had\r\naccomplished them. Every duty of which he was capable was finished, and he\r\ncould have added nothing to his good reputation if his years had been\r\nprolonged.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLIAM GRIMSHAW, born in Ireland in 1781, but nearly all his life a\r\nresident of this country, where he was for many years well known as a\r\nwriter, died near Philadelphia on the 8th of January. Besides editing and\r\nrewriting a considerable portion of Baine’s _History of the Wars growing\r\nout of the French Revolution_, he was the author of Histories of Great\r\nBritain, France, and several other countries, which for a long time were\r\nvery generally used as text-books in schools, and he also wrote _The\r\nAmerican Chesterfield_, _The Ladies’ Lexicon_, and numerous smaller\r\nvolumes, which were creditable to his abilities. His reading was\r\nextensive, and his knowledge of events during his lifetime, particularly\r\nin British affairs, was minute and accurate. His mind lost none of its\r\nvigor with the approach of age, and in his fine countenance, and imposing\r\nfigure, there were no appearances of decay. His love of reading continued\r\nto the last, and within a year he frequently employed his pen on such\r\nsubjects as he took an especial interest in.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNICHOLAS GRAN DE DIEU SOULT, Marshal General of France, Duke of Dalmatia,\r\n&c., died on the 26th of December, at his chateau of Soult Berg, near the\r\nplace where he was born. We have given in another part of this magazine an\r\nestimate of his character. The Paris _Pays_ furnishes us a brief abstract\r\nof his history. He was born at St. Amand (Tarn), March 29, 1769. His\r\nfather, who was a notary, seeing that he had no taste for his own\r\nprofession, allowed him to enter the army. The future Marshal of France\r\nentered the Royal Regiment of Infantry in 1785, where he was soon remarked\r\nby his aptitude for the functions of instructor. He was made\r\nnon-commissioned officer in 1790, and then passed rapidly through the\r\nintermediate grades, until he reached that of Adjutant-General of the\r\nStaff, when General Lefebvre attached him to his own service with the\r\ngrade of Chief of Brigade. In that quality he went through the campaigns\r\nof 1794 and 1795 with the army of the Moselle, and owed to his talents, as\r\nwell as to his republican principles, a rapid promotion. Successively\r\nraised to the rank of General of Brigade, and then to that of General of\r\nDivision, he took part in all the campaigns of Germany until 1799, when he\r\nfollowed Massena into Switzerland, and thence to Genoa, where he was\r\nwounded and taken prisoner. Set at liberty after the battle of Marengo,\r\nand raised to the command of Piedmont, he returned to France at the peace\r\nof Amiens, and was named one of the four Colonels of the Guard of the\r\nConsuls. When the Empire was proclaimed, in 1804, he was nominated Marshal\r\nof France, and during the campaign which terminated in Austerlitz, held\r\nthe command of the fourth corps of the grand army. After the conquest of\r\nPrussia and the battle of Eylau, Marshal Soult solicited and obtained the\r\ncommand of the second corps of the army of Spain, with which he overran\r\nGalicia and the Austrians, and passed into Portugal, where he fought the\r\nmemorable battle of Oporto. Forced to abandon that city, when delivered up\r\nby treason to the English, he effected into Galicia a bold and perilous\r\nretreat, which did the greatest honor to his energy and presence of mind.\r\nBeing named Commander-in-Chief of the army of Spain, he marched to the\r\nsuccor of Madrid, menaced by the Anglo-Spanish army, and his movement was\r\ncrowned with full success. He continued in this command until March, 1813,\r\nwhen he was appointed in Saxony to the command-in-chief of the Imperial\r\nGuard. The disasters of Vittoria decided Napoleon to again confer on\r\nMarshal Soult the command of the French troops in Spain. The point then\r\nwas to defend the menaced frontier of France. Forced to fall back on\r\nToulouse, he there terminated by a brilliant engagement, due to most able\r\nstrategic arrangements, the fatal campaign of 1814. On the announcement of\r\nthe event at Paris he signed a suspension of arms, and adhered to the\r\nreëstablishment of Louis XVIII., who presented him with the Cross of St.\r\nLouis, and called him to the command of the 13th military division, and\r\nthen to the Ministry of War (Dec. 3, 1814). On March 8th, learning the\r\nlanding from Elba, he published the order of the day which is so well\r\nknown, and in which Napoleon is treated more than severely. On March 11th\r\nhe resigned his portfolio as Minister of War, and declared for the\r\nEmperor, who, passing over the famous proclamation, raised him to the\r\ndignity of Peer of France and Major General of the Army. After Waterloo,\r\nwhere he fought most energetically, the Marshal took refuge at Malzieu\r\n(Lozere) with General Brun de Villeret, his former aid-de-camp. Being set\r\ndown on the list of the proscribed, he withdrew to Dusseldorf on the banks\r\nof the Rhine, until 1819, when a Royal ordinance allowed him to return to\r\nFrance. He then went to live with his family at St. Amand, his native\r\nplace, and on his reiterated representations his marshal’s baton, which\r\nhad been withdrawn from him, was restored. Charles X. treated Marshal\r\nSoult with favor, creating him knight of his orders, and afterward making\r\nhim Peer of France. After the revolution of July, 1830, the declaration of\r\nthe Chamber of Deputies of August 9th excluded him from that rank, but he\r\nwas restored to it four days later by a special nomination of Louis\r\nPhilippe, who soon after appointed him Minister of War. We shall not\r\nfollow Marshal Soult through the acts of his administrative career. He\r\nalways showed himself devoted to the constitutive principles of the\r\nGovernment of July. He was twice named President of the Council of King\r\nLouis Philippe, who elevated him to the dignity of Marshal General, of\r\nwhich Turenne had been the last possessor. Since the revolution of\r\nFebruary, Marshal Soult has lived on his estate, in the midst of his\r\nfamily, and almost forgotten in our present political agitations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKARL FRIEDERICH RUNGENHAGEN, late Royal Director of Music at Berlin, was\r\nborn in that city on September 27, 1778. His father was a merchant. In\r\n1801 he became member of the Singing Academy, and studied under Zetter. In\r\n1814 he wrote the songs for a melo-drama, which was not successful. In\r\n1815 he became director of the Singing Academy, with Zetter; most of his\r\nreligious music was composed after this time. In 1825 he was appointed to\r\nthe post of Royal Music Director, and in 1833, after Zetter’s death, he\r\nbecame sole conductor of the Singing Academy. His influence has been\r\nconsiderable upon the culture of music in Germany. Carl Maria Von Weber\r\nwas his friend, and Lortzing was one of his pupils. He died at Berlin on\r\nthe 22d of last December.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe journals of Moscow announce the death of the Armenian Archbishop,\r\nMICHAEL SALLANTIAN, the most distinguished writer of Armenia at the\r\npresent day. He was born at Constantinople in 1782, and educated at the\r\nArmenian monastery at Venice. He died at the age of sixty-nine at Moscow,\r\nwhere he had been professor of theology and literature for sixteen years\r\nbefore his elevation to the Archbishopric.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. GRAEFE, one of the most eminent veterans of European philology, died\r\nsuddenly at St Petersburg on November 30th. He was born at Chemnitz, in\r\nSaxony, in July, 1780, but went to Russia in 1810, to assume the\r\nprofessorship of Greek at the Academy of St. Petersburg.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Russian General, Kiel, has died in Paris. He was employed by the\r\nEmperor Nicholas in directing works of art in the Russian empire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHERR MEINHOLD, author of the _Amber Witch_, died in Germany in December.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJ. W. M. TURNER, the greatest of English artists, and the hero of Mr.\r\nRuskin’s brilliant book entitled _The Modern Painters_, died in London on\r\nthe 20th of December, at the age of 77. He had always a reluctance to have\r\nhis portrait taken, but the engraving accompanying this article—from a\r\nsketch made without his knowledge—is said, by the _Illustrated London\r\nNews_ to be remarkably like him. It is understood that by his will he has\r\nleft a million dollars (£200,000) for the purpose of founding an\r\ninstitution for the relief of of decayed artists, and has given it also\r\nthe chief part of his pictures, to adorn the building which is to be\r\noccupied by it. The _Times_ says, \"although it would be out of place to\r\nrevive the discussions occasioned by the peculiarities of Mr. Turner’s\r\nstyle in his later years, he has left behind him sufficient proofs of the\r\nvariety and fertility of his genius to establish an undoubted claim to a\r\nprominent rank among the painters of England. His life had been extended\r\nto the verge of human existence; for although he was fond of throwing a\r\nmystery over his precise age, we believe that he was born in Maiden-lane,\r\nCovent-garden, in the year 1775, and was, consequently, in his 76th or\r\n77th year. Of humble origin (he was the son of a barber), he enjoyed the\r\nadvantages of an accurate rather than a liberal education. His first\r\nstudies, some of which are still in existence, were in architectural\r\ndesign; and few of those who have been astonished or enchanted by the\r\nprofusion and caprice of form and color in his mature pictures, would have\r\nguessed the minute and scientific precision with which he had cultivated\r\nthe arts of linear drawing and perspective. His early manhood was spent\r\npartly on the coast, where he imbibed his inexhaustible attachment for\r\nmarine scenery and his acquaintance with the wild and varied aspect of the\r\nocean. Somewhat later he repaired to Oxford, where he contributed for\r\nseveral years the drawing to the _University Almanac_. But his genius was\r\nrapidly breaking through all obstacles, and even the repugnance of public\r\nopinion; for before he had completed his 30th year he was on the high road\r\nto fame. As early as 1790 he exhibited his first work, a water-colored\r\ndrawing of the entrance to Lambeth, at the exhibition of the Academy, and\r\nin 1793 his first oil painting. In November, 1799, he was elected an\r\nassociate, and in February, 1802, he attained the rank of a Royal\r\nAcademician. We shall not here attempt to trace the vast series of his\r\npaintings from his earlier productions, such as the \"Wreck,\" in Lord\r\nYarborough’s collection, the \"Italian Landscape,\" in the same gallery, the\r\n_pendant_ to Lord Ellesmere’s \"Vanderwelde,\" or Mr. Munro’s \"Venus and\r\nAdonis,\" in the Titianesque manner, to the more obscure, original, and, as\r\nsome think, unapproachable productions of his later years, such as the\r\n\"Rome,\" the \"Venice,\" the \"Golden Bough,\" the \"Téméraire,\" and the\r\n\"Tusculum.\" But while these great works proceeded rapidly from his\r\npalette, his powers of design were no less actively engaged in the\r\nexquisite water-colored drawings that have formed the basis of the modern\r\nschool of \"illustration.\" The \"Liber studiorum\" had been commenced in\r\n1807, in imitation of Claude’s \"Liber veritatis,\" and was etched, if we\r\nare not mistaken, by Turner’s own hand. The title-page was engraved and\r\naltered half-a-dozen times, from his singular and even nervous attention\r\nto the most trifling details. But this volume was only the precursor of an\r\nimmense series of drawings and sketches, embracing the topography of this\r\ncountry in the \"River Scenery\" and the \"Southern Coast\"—the scenery of the\r\nAlps, of Italy, and great part of Europe—and the ideal creations of our\r\ngreatest poets, from Milton to Scott and Rogers, all imbued with the\r\nbrilliancy of a genius which seemed to address itself more peculiarly to\r\nthe world at large when it adopted the popular form of engraving. These\r\ndrawings are now widely diffused in England, and form the basis of several\r\nimportant collections, such as those of Petworth, of Mr. Windus, Mr.\r\nFawkes, and Mr. Munro. So great is the value of them that 120 guineas have\r\nnot unfrequently been paid for a small sketch in water-colors; and a\r\nsketch-book, containing chalk-drawings of one of Turner’s river tours on\r\nthe continent, has lately fetched the enormous sum of 600 guineas. The\r\nprices of his more finished oil paintings have ranged in the last few\r\nyears from 700 to 1,200 or 1,400 guineas. All his works may now be said to\r\nhave acquired triple or quadruple the value originally paid for them. Mr.\r\nTurner undoubtedly realized a very large fortune, and great curiosity will\r\nbe felt to ascertain the posthumous use he has made of it. His personal\r\nhabits were peculiar, and even penurious, but in all that related to his\r\nart he was generous to munificence; and we are not without hope that his\r\nlast intentions were for the benefit of the nation, and the preservation\r\nof his own fame. He was never married, he was not known to have any\r\nrelations, and his wants were limited to the strictest simplicity. The\r\nonly ornaments of his house in Queen Anne-street were the pictures by his\r\nown hand, which he had constantly refused to part with at any price, among\r\nwhich the \"Rise and Fall of Carthage\" and the \"Crossing the Brook,\" rank\r\namong the choicest specimens of his finest manner.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Turner seldom took much part in society, and only displayed in the\r\nclosest intimacy the shrewdness of his observation and the playfulness of\r\nhis wit. Every where he kept back much of what was in him, and while the\r\nkeenest intelligence, mingled with a strong tinge of satire, animated his\r\nbrisk countenance, it seemed to amuse him to be but half understood. His\r\nnearest social ties were those formed in the Royal Academy, of which he\r\nwas by far the oldest member, and to whose interests he was most warmly\r\nattached. He filled at one time the chair of Professor of Perspective, but\r\nwithout conspicuous success, and that science has since been taught in the\r\nAcademy by means better suited to promote it than a course of lectures. In\r\nthe composition and execution of his works, Mr. Turner was jealously\r\nsensitive of all interference or supervision. He loved to deal in the\r\nsecrets and mysteries of his art, and many of his peculiar effects are\r\nproduced by means which it would not be easy to discover or to imitate.\r\n\r\n\"We hope that the Society of Arts or the British Gallery will take an\r\nearly opportunity of commemorating the genius of this great artist, and of\r\nreminding the public of the prodigious range of his pencil, by forming a\r\ngeneral exhibition of his principal works, if, indeed, they are not\r\npermanently gathered in a nobler repository. Such an exhibition will serve\r\nfar better than any observations of ours to demonstrate that it is not by\r\nthose deviations from established rules which arrest the most superficial\r\ncriticism that Mr. Turner’s fame or merit are to be estimated. For nearly\r\nsixty years Mr. Turner contributed largely to the arts of this country. He\r\nlived long enough to see his greatest productions rise to uncontested\r\nsupremacy, however imperfectly they were understood when they first\r\nappeared in the earlier years of this century; and, though in his later\r\nworks and in advanced age, force and precision of execution have not\r\naccompanied his vivacity of conception, public opinion has gradually and\r\nsteadily advanced to a more just appreciation of his power. He is the\r\nShelley of English painting—the poet and the painter both alike veiling\r\ntheir own creations in the dazzling splendor of the imagery with which\r\nthey are surrounded, mastering every mode of expression, combining\r\nscientific labor with an air of negligent profusion, and producing in the\r\nend works in which color and language are but the vestments of poetry. Of\r\nsuch minds it may be said in the words of Alastor:\r\n\r\n    \"Nature’s most secret steps\r\n  He, like her shadow, has pursued, where’er\r\n  The red volcano overcanopies\r\n  Its fields of snow and pinnacles of ice\r\n  With burning smoke; or where the starry domes\r\n  Of diamond and of gold expand above\r\n  Numberless and immeasurable halls,\r\n  Frequent with crystal column and clear shrines\r\n  Of pearl, and thrones radiant with chrysolite.\r\n  Nor had that scene of ampler majesty\r\n  Than gems or gold—the varying roof of heaven\r\n  And the green earth—lost in his heart its claims\r\n  To love and wonder....\"\r\n\r\n                 [Illustration: THE LATE J. W. M. TURNER]\r\n\r\n                         THE LATE J. W. M. TURNER\r\n\r\n\r\nBASIL MONTAGU, an eminent philosophical and legal writer, was the\r\nillegitimate son of the well-known statesman, John fourth Earl of\r\nSandwich, many years First Lord of the Admiralty, by the unfortunate Miss\r\nMargaret Reay, who was assassinated, in 1779, by her affianced lover, the\r\nRev. Mr. Hackman. The tragic affair, which excited immense interest at the\r\ntime, and which gave rise to various romantic stories, is to be found in\r\nmost series of judicial investigations, and especially in a collection of\r\ncelebrated trials recently published. It appears that Margaret Reay was\r\nthe daughter of a stay-maker in Covent-garden, and served her\r\napprenticeship to a mantuamaker. Having attracted the attention of Lord\r\nSandwich, he treated her from that period until her assassination, with\r\nthe greatest tenderness and affection. He introduced to her a young ensign\r\nof the 68th Regiment, then in command of a recruiting party at Huntingdon,\r\nin the neighborhood of the mansion of the Montagues. Mr. Hackman from the\r\nfirst moment was desperately in love with her, and his passion increased\r\nwith the daily opportunities afforded by invitations he received to Lord\r\nSandwich’s table. With the object of continuing his attentions, and the\r\nhope of ultimately engaging her affections, he quitted the army, and,\r\ntaking orders, obtained the living of Wiverton, in Norfolk. That Miss Reay\r\nhad given him some encouragement, is proved by the tenor of their\r\ncorrespondence; but prudential motives induced her afterwards to refuse\r\nthe offer of his hand, and to intimate a necessity for discontinuing his\r\nvisits. Stung by this unexpected termination of his long-cherished\r\nexpectations, Hackman’s mind became unsettled; on the 7th of April, 1779,\r\nhe was occupied all the morning in reading Blair’s _Sermons_; but in the\r\nevening, as he was walking towards the Admiralty, he saw Miss Reay pass in\r\nher coach, accompanied by Signora Galli. He followed, and discovered that\r\nshe alighted at Covent-garden Theatre, where she went to witness _Love in\r\na Village_. He returned to his lodgings, armed himself with a brace of\r\npistols, went back to the theatre, and when the performance was over, as\r\nMiss Reay was stepping into her coach, he took a pistol in each hand, one\r\nof which he discharged at her, and killed her on the spot, and the other\r\nat himself, but it did not take effect. He then beat his head with the\r\nbutt of the pistol, to destroy himself, but was, after a struggle, secured\r\nand carried before Sir John Fielding, who committed him to Bridewell, and\r\nhe was shortly after tried at the Old Bailey, before the celebrated\r\nJustice Blackstone, found guilty, and hanged at Tyburn on the 19th of the\r\nmonth.\r\n\r\nBasil Montagu was born in 1770, and received his education at the Charter\r\nHouse. He was called to the English bar by the Society of Gray’s Inn, the\r\n19th of May, 1798, and soon obtained considerable practice as a\r\nconveyancer. It was, however, by his legal authorship and reporting that\r\nhe became particularly distinguished in the profession. His various works\r\nand reports on the subject, principally of the Law of Bankruptcy, were of\r\nhigh estimation and lasting utility. In 1801, he produced his _Summary of\r\nthe Law of Set Off_, with an Appendix of Cases, argued and determined in\r\nthe Courts of Law and Equity, in one volume, octavo; in 1804-5, in four\r\nvolumes, _A Digest of the Bankrupt Laws_, with a Collection of the\r\nStatutes and of the Cases, which reached three editions, and brought him\r\ninto immediate notice and considerable practice; and, some time afterward,\r\nhe printed a pamphlet on Bankrupts’ Certificates. His fame in this branch\r\nof forensic learning procured him the appointment of a Commissioner of\r\nBankruptcy. Mr. Montagu wrote also on philosophical subjects. Among his\r\nproductions of this tendency were _Thoughts of Divines and Philosophers;\r\nSelections from Taylor, Hooker, Bishop Hall, and Bacon_. He edited an\r\nedition of Lord Bacon’s works, in seventeen volumes. Another bent which\r\nhis mind took, placed him by the side of Romilly and Mackintosh in the\r\ncause of Humanity. He had in his nature an abhorrence of depriving any\r\nliving thing of life, and with regard to his own diet he totally abstained\r\nfrom animal food. This led him to bestow his active attention towards\r\nputting a stop to capital punishment. In 1809 he published _Opinions of\r\nDifferent Authors on the Punishment of Death_. The work was so well\r\nreceived, that he added a a second and third volume to it. In 1811, when\r\nthe important question occupied Parliament, he edited _The Debates on a\r\nBill for Abolishing the Punishment of Death for Stealing in a Dwelling\r\nHouse_. In 1815 he reprinted a tract originally published in 1801, called\r\n_Hanging not Punishment enough for Murderers_. Mr. Basil Montagu, who had\r\nsome years ago been made a Queen’s counsel, died at Boulogne on the 27th\r\nof November, in the eighty-second year of his age.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREAR-ADMIRAL HENRY GAGE MORRIS, entered the navy at the early age of\r\ntwelve, and served as midshipman throughout the French and American wars.\r\nHe was promoted to the rank of lieutenant, April 2, 1793. He was engaged\r\nat the capture of the French frigate _Sybille_, in 1783, and at the attack\r\non Martinique, in 1793. He was promoted to post rank August 12, 1812, and\r\nwas made rear-admiral in 1847. He died at Beverley, 24th ult. aged\r\neighty-two. Admiral Morris was younger brother of the late Captain Amherst\r\nMorris, being second son of Colonel Roger Morris, a member of the\r\nGovernor’s Council at New-York, by Mary, daughter of Frederick Phillipse,\r\nof this city. This family of Morris is one of great antiquity, deriving\r\nits descent from Elystan Glodrydd, a famed chieftain of Wales in the\r\neleventh century.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. SAPIO the once celebrated tenor singer, was born in London, in 1792.\r\nIn his early life he was page to Queen Caroline, consort of George IV. He\r\nmade his first appearance on the metropolitan stage at Drury Lane, the 1st\r\nDecember, 1824, as the _Seraskier_, in the \"Siege of Belgrade,\" and he\r\nsoon attained and long preserved a high vocal reputation. He died in\r\nobscurity, in London, about the end of November.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the most distinguished chiefs of the war of Greek independence,\r\nGeneral JATRAKO, is just dead at Athens. He was one of the primates of\r\nMarna; his family, as his name indicates, have for many generations back\r\nbeen famous for their hereditary medical talents, and the tradition exists\r\namong them that a branch of their family formerly passed from Sparta to\r\nItaly, translated their name into Medici, and gave rise to the celebrated\r\nfamily of that name.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPRIESSNITZ, the celebrated founder of hydropathy, died at Graefenberg on\r\nthe 26th of November, at the age of fifty-two. In the morning of that day\r\nPriessnitz was up and stirring at an early hour, but complained of the\r\ncold, and had wood brought in to make a large fire. His friends had for\r\nsome time believed him to be suffering from dropsy of the chest, and at\r\ntheir earnest entreaty he consented to take a little medicine, exclaiming\r\nall the while, \"It’s of no use!\" He would see no physician, but remained\r\nto the last true to his profession. About four o’clock in the afternoon of\r\nthe 26th he asked to be carried to bed, and upon being laid down he\r\nexpired! In early life he received serious injury in the chest from an\r\naccident, and he used to say himself that his constitution was bad; that\r\nnothing but his own mode of life and his own \"cure\" would have sustained\r\nhim. It is not known what attempts will be made to carry on the\r\nestablishment at Graefenberg, which was in full activity at the moment of\r\nhis death. The most probable conjecture is, that his eldest daughter and\r\nher husband (a Hungarian of property) will carry it on, with the aid of\r\nsome physician who has studied Priessnitz’s method. This may succeed to a\r\ncertain extent, for the place and neighborhood are admirably adapted for\r\ntaking the water-cure, and the _prestige_ of Priessnitz’s name, as well as\r\nthe tradition of his practice, will long survive him: but the attraction\r\nwhich brought patients, not only from the neighboring cities, but from the\r\nremotest parts of the world, is gone. It is not exactly known what amount\r\nof property Priessnitz left, but it is supposed to be nearly £100,000.\r\nWhen it is considered how small, compared to that given to other\r\nphysicians, was the remuneration he received from his patients, and that\r\nthirty years ago, Priessnitz was a poor peasant, this fortune gives some\r\nmeasure of his immense success.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGEORGE DUNBAR, the distinguished Professor of Greek Literature in the\r\nUniversity of Edinburgh, died on the 6th of December, at his residence in\r\nthat city. The natural decay attending even an otherwise green old age has\r\nbeen for some years aggravated by a virulent internal malady, which at the\r\ncommencement of the present season compelled him to relinquish his\r\nacademic duties. He was born at the village of Caldingham, in\r\nBerwickshire, in 1774. In early life he labored as a gardener, but an\r\naccidental lameness, which lasted throughout his subsequent life,\r\nincapacitated him from active bodily employment. His attention was then\r\ndevoted to literature. He soon became a scholar, and in truth a ripe and\r\ngood one. Going to Edinburgh, he readily obtained, on proof of his\r\nacquirements, a tutorship in the family of Lord Provost Fettes. Having\r\nbeen shortly after selected as assistant to Professor Dalziel, he was\r\nappointed, on that professor’s death, to the Greek chair in the Edinburgh\r\nUniversity, in 1805. The duties of this responsible position he discharged\r\nmost zealously and ably. The published works of Professor Dunbar are well\r\nknown. The _Collectanea Minora_, the _Collectanea Majora_, and the _Greek\r\nGrammar_, have all had great reputation. His chief production—massive in\r\nevery sense—the main object of his life of learned toil, was his Greek\r\nLexicon, which was given to the world with his name in 1840.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. HENRY LUTTRELL, one of the ornaments of a society of what may be\r\ntermed conversational wits, died on the 19th of December, at the advanced\r\nage of eighty-six. He was the friend and companion, _hand impari passu_,\r\nof Jeckyll, Mackintosh, Jeffrey, Alvanley, Sydney Smith, and others of\r\nthat brilliant school, and of which the Misses Berry, Rogers, Moore, and\r\nbut a few others, are still left. A correspondent of the _Times_ says: \"He\r\ncharmed especially by the playfulness and elegance of his wit, the\r\nappropriateness and felicity of illustration, the shrewdness of his\r\nremarks, and the epigrammatic point of his conversation. Liveliness of\r\nfancy was tempered in him with good breeding and great kindness of\r\ndisposition; and one of the wittiest men of his day, he could amuse and\r\ndelight by the keenness of playful yet pungent sallies, without wounding\r\nthe feelings of any one by the indulgence of bitterness and ill-nature.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnglish journals notice with expressions of regret the death in\r\nPhiladelphia of R. C. TAYLOR, on the 26th of October, aged sixty-two. Mr.\r\nTaylor emigrated in the year 1830, being previously well known as a Fellow\r\nboth of the Antiquarian and of the Geological Societies. He had published\r\na work of great care and research while resident in his native county,\r\nNorfolk, _Index Monasticus for East Anglia_; and had made some useful\r\nexplorations into the fossil remains on the coast of Norfolk. In America\r\nhe wrote for various philosophical societies, and published, in 1848, his\r\nwork on the Statistics of Coal, by which alone he was much known to the\r\npublic of this country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Royal University of Berlin has lost by death since Christmas, MM.\r\nLachmann, Stuhr, Jacobi, Erman, and Dr. CHARLES THEODORE FRANZ, who died\r\nat Breslaw early in January, at the untimely age of forty-five. For eleven\r\nyears Dr. Franz occupied the chair of Classical Philology in the\r\nUniversity of Berlin. He is the author of a variety of works: in the first\r\nrank of which stand his Criticisms on the Greek Tragic Poets, and his\r\nseveral collections of Greek and Latin inscriptions before unpublished.\r\nThe London Morning Chronicle remarks that the continent never before lost\r\nso many great scholars in one year as in 1851.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLIAM JACOB, F.R.S., a profound writer on science and agriculture, was\r\nborn in 1762. His work, _An Inquiry into the Precious Metals_, has been\r\nheld in high estimation. His other principal productions were\r\n_Considerations on the Price of Corn_; _Tracts on Corn-Laws_; and a _View\r\nof Agriculture in Germany_. Mr. Jacob, who was formerly Comptroller of\r\nCorn Returns in the Board of Trade, died on the 17th of December, at his\r\nresidence in London, aged eighty-eight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. PAUL BARRAS, died in Paris from wounds received in the contests\r\nbetween the people and the military, on the second day of the usurpation\r\nof Louis Napoleon. M. Barras resided in New-York about twenty years, and\r\nwas engaged here as a teacher of his native language, and as a\r\ncorrespondent of one of the Parisian journals. He was an amiable man, of\r\nconsiderable talents, and enthusiastic in his attachment to Republicanism.\r\nHe wrote several articles on American subjects in the _Revue de Paris_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLADIES’ FASHIONS FOR FEBRUARY.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              [Illustration]\r\n\r\nIn matters of fashion there have been very few changes since our last\r\npublication. We are in the midst of the gay season, but its modes, until\r\ndisturbed by the approach of spring, were fixed before the holidays, and\r\nfor the most part have already been reported. The Paris journals, we may\r\nremark, however, dwell much on the unusual ascendency of black, in furs,\r\nvelvets, cloths, and other heavy stuffs, for walking and carriage dresses,\r\nand on the greater demand than in recent winters for every species of\r\nembroidery.\r\n\r\nIn the first of the above figures, representing a promenade costume, we\r\nhave a high dress of rich silk; the skirt has plaided tucks woven in the\r\nmaterial; it is long, and very full. Manteau of velvet, very richly\r\nembroidered; a broad black lace is set on round the shoulders in the style\r\nof a cape, and the cloak is embroidered above it. Capote of white silk, of\r\na very elegant form, with deep bavolet or curtain; a droop of small\r\nfeathers on the left side.\r\n\r\nThe second figure, or visiting costume, of heavy silk, with four flounces,\r\nand corresponding waistcoat. The waistcoat now takes the first place in a\r\nlady’s toilette, and may be considered a triumph of luxury and elegance,\r\nreviving every description of embroidery, and forcing the jewellers to be\r\nconstantly bringing out some novelty in buttons, &c. It is made very\r\nsimple or very richly ornamented: for instance, those of the most simple\r\ndescription are made either of black velvet, embroidered with braid, and\r\nfastened with black jet buttons, or of cachemire; and a pretty style, of\r\nstraw color, embroidered in the same colored silk, and closed with fancy\r\nsilk bell buttons, whilst a few may be seen in white, quilted and\r\nembroidered with oak leaves and rose-buds. The rich style of waistcoat\r\nbeing covered with embroideries, and being closed up the front with\r\nbuttons of brilliants. As a general rule, the waistcoat is made high up\r\nthe throat, round which is a fall of lace, or opens _en cœur_, having a\r\n_fichu à plastron_ of embroidery, worn under. The waistcoat has also two\r\npockets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n\r\n    1 The large outer porch of Cowley’s house had chambers above it and\r\n      beneath the window in front a tablet was affixed, upon which was\r\n      inscribed the epitaph \"upon the living author\" which Cowley had\r\n      written for himself, whilst living in retirement here, commencing\r\n\r\n        \"Hic, O Viator, sub lare parvulo,\r\n        Couleius hic est conditus hic jacet.\"\r\n\r\n      It is represented in its original condition in the two views we have\r\n      engraved.\r\n\r\n    2 Some additional rooms have been added to the house by the same\r\n      occupant, who has, however, religiously preserved all the old rooms,\r\n      which still exhibit the \"fittings\" that existed in Cowley’s time.\r\n      The bed-chambers are wainscotted with oaken panels. The staircase is\r\n      a very solid structure, with ornamental balusters, leading toward\r\n      the small study in which the poet wrote,—a little back room, about\r\n      five feet wide, looking upon the garden. It may be distinguished in\r\n      our back view of the house, by a figure placed at the window. Cowley\r\n      ended his life in this house at the early age of forty-nine.\r\n\r\n    3 Brayley, in his History of Surrey, states that Cowley accompanied by\r\n      his friend Dean Spratt, having been to see a \"friend,\" did not set\r\n      out for his walk home until it was too late, and had drunk so deep,\r\n      that they both lay out in the fields all night; this gave Cowley the\r\n      fever that carried him off. Brayley’s authority for this slander\r\n      (which is not borne out by the poet’s previous course of life), is\r\n      \"Spence’s Anecdotes.\"\r\n\r\n    4 Life and Letters of Joseph Story, Associate Justice of the Supreme\r\n      Court of the United States, and Dane professor of law at Harvard\r\n      University.

Boston:\r\n      Little & Brown, 1851.\r\n\r\n    5 As an example of the gravity and formality with which proceedings in\r\n      matters of this nature were conducted, even as late as the end of\r\n      the sixteenth century, take the subjoined palinode or recantation of\r\n      a Flemish ecclesiastic, who had been guilty of the offence of\r\n      doubting the evection, or bodily transport through the air, of\r\n      witches and wizards. The original may be found in Delrio, at the end\r\n      of the Appendix, in his 5th book:—\r\n\r\n      \"I Cornelius Loseus Gallidius, born in the town of Gouda, in\r\n      Holland, now, by the command of the renowned and illustrious Lord\r\n      Nuncio Apostolic, the Lord Octavius Bishop of Tricaruis, arrested\r\n      and detained in the Imperial Monastery of St. Maximin, near Treves,\r\n      on account of certain tracts ’On True and False Witchcraft,’ rashly\r\n      and presumptuously by me written, published, and sent to be printed\r\n      at Cologne, without the perusal or permission of the superiors of\r\n      this place: whereas I am informed for certain that in the aforesaid\r\n      books, and also in certain of letters on the same subject, sent\r\n      clandestinely to the clergy and senate of Treves, and others, for\r\n      the purpose of impeding the course of justice against witches and\r\n      magicians, there are contained many articles which are not only\r\n      erroneous and scandalous, but also suspected of heresy, and savoring\r\n      of sedition: I therefore hereby revoke, condemn, reject, and\r\n      repudiate, as if they had never been said or asserted by me, the\r\n      said articles, as seditious and temerarious, contrary to the common\r\n      judgment of learned theologians, to the decision and bulls of the\r\n      supreme Pontiffs, and to the practice, and statutes, and laws of the\r\n      magistrates and judges, as well as of this Archdiocese of Treves, as\r\n      of the other provinces and principalities, in the order in which the\r\n      same are hereunto annexed.\r\n\r\n      \"1. _Imprimis._ I revoke, condemn, reject, and hold as disproved,\r\n      what both in words and writing I have often and to many persons\r\n      pertinaciously asserted; and what I would have had taken as the head\r\n      and chief ornament of my disputations, to wit, that what is written\r\n      touching the corporeal evection or translation from place to place\r\n      of witches and magicians, is to be held as a vain superstition and\r\n      figment, as well because that opinion savors of heretical pravity,\r\n      as because it partakes of sedition, and so also savors of the crimes\r\n      of _lese majesté_. 2. In the second place, I revoke what I have\r\n      pertinaciously, but without solid reasons, alleged against the\r\n      magistracy, in letters secretly sent to several, that is to say,\r\n      that the course of procedure against witches is erroneous and\r\n      fantastical: asserting, moreover, that those witches were compelled\r\n      by the severity of torture to confess acts that they had never done;\r\n      that innocent blood was shed by a cruel judicature; and that by a\r\n      new alchemy gold and silver were extracted from human blood. 3.\r\n      Thereby, and by the like assertions, partly diffused by private oral\r\n      communications among the vulgar, partly by various letters addressed\r\n      to both branches of the magistracy, imputing to superiors and judges\r\n      the exercise of tyranny towards the subjects. 4 And consequently,\r\n      inasmuch as the most reverend and illustrious Archbishop and Prince\r\n      Elector of Treves not only permits witches and magicians to be\r\n      subjected to deserved punishment in his diocese, but has also\r\n      ordained laws regulating the mode and cost of the procedure against\r\n      witches, thereby with inconsiderate temerity tacitly insinuating the\r\n      charge of tyranny against the said Elector of Treves. 5. _Item._ I\r\n      revoke and condemn these following conclusions, to wit, that there\r\n      are no such beings as sorcerers, who renounce God and worship the\r\n      Devil, who bring on tempests, and do the work of Satan and such\r\n      like, but that all these things are dreams. 6. Moreover that magic\r\n      is not to be called sorcery, nor its practisers to be deemed\r\n      sorcerers, and that that that place of Exod. xxii, (’Ye shall not\r\n      suffer sorcerers to live’) is to be understood of those who slay\r\n      with material poison, naturally administered. 7. That no contract\r\n      exists or can exist between man and the demon. 8. That demons do not\r\n      assume bodies. 9. That the life of Hilary, written by St. Jerome, is\r\n      not authentic. 10. That the demon cannot carnally know mankind. 11.\r\n      That neither demons nor witches can excite tempests, rain, hail,\r\n      &c., and that what is alleged in that behalf is mere dreams. 12.\r\n      That spirits and forms can be seen by mankind separate from matter.\r\n      13. That it is rash to assert that whatever demons can do magicians\r\n      can also by the help of demons. 14. That the assertion that the\r\n      superior demon can expel the inferior is erroneous and derogatory to\r\n      Christ.—Luke xi. 15. That the Popes in the bulls do not allege that\r\n      magicians and sorcerers perpetrate such acts as above mentioned.\r\n\r\n      \"All these and the like, my assertions, with my many calumnies,\r\n      falsehoods, and sycophancies, petulantly, indecorously, and\r\n      mendaciously expressed against the magistracy, as well secular as\r\n      ecclesiastical, wherewith my writings on witchcraft abound, I hereby\r\n      expressly and deliberately condemn, recant, and reject, earnestly\r\n      beseeching pardon of God and my superiors, and faithfully promising\r\n      that henceforth I will not, either by word of mouth or by writing,\r\n      by myself or others, in any place where I shall happen to be, teach,\r\n      promulgate, or assert the same or any of them. If I shall do to the\r\n      contrary, I subject myself thenceforth and henceforth to the pains\r\n      of the law against relapsed heretics, recusants, seditious\r\n      misdemeanants, and convicts of _lese majesté_, to the pains of\r\n      libellous sycophants publicly convicted, and also to those enacted\r\n      against perjurers. I submit myself also to arbitrary correction at\r\n      the pleasure of the Archbishop of Treves, and of the other\r\n      magistrates under whom I shall happen to live, and who may be\r\n      certified of my relapse or violated undertaking, that they may\r\n      punish me according to my deserts, in name, fame, goods, and body.\r\n      In testimony of all which I have, with my proper hand, subscribed\r\n      this my recantation of the aforesaid articles, in presence of the\r\n      notary and witnesses.\"\r\n\r\n      \"(Signed,)   Cornelius Loseus Gallidius.\"\r\n\r\n      \"Attestation.—These presents were done in the Imperial Monastery of\r\n      Saint Maximin Without, near Treves, in the abbatial chamber, there\r\n      being then present the Venerable and Excellent Lord Peter Binsfeldt,\r\n      Bishop of Azof, Vicar-General of the Most Reverend Lord Archbishop\r\n      of Treves, our Most Gracious Lord in matters spiritual; Reiner,\r\n      Abbot of the said monastery; Bartholomew Bodegem, Reader of either\r\n      Law in the Ecclesiastical Court of Treves; George Helffenster,\r\n      Doctor of Sacred Theology, Dean of the Collegiate Church of St.\r\n      Simon, in the city of Treves; and John Golmann, Doctor of Laws,\r\n      Canon of the said Church, and Seal-Bearer of the Court of Treves,\r\n      &c.; in the year of our Lord 1592, Treves style, on Monday, the 15th\r\n      day of the month of March, in presence of me, the Notary\r\n      underwritten, and of Nicholas Dolent, and Daniel Major, the\r\n      Amanuensis and Secretary respectively of the Reverend Lord Abbot,\r\n      trustworthy witnesses specially called and required hereto.\r\n\r\n      \"Subscribed, Adam Tecton, Notary.\r\n\r\n      \"Compared with the original and found to agree, by me, the\r\n      under-written Secretary of the town of Antwerp.\r\n\r\n                                                              S.
