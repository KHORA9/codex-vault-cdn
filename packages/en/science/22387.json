He was apprenticed to a merchant at Lynn, but his activity of\r\nmind caused him to be busy over many questions of the day.  He wrote when\r\nhe was seventeen a pamphlet on American politics, for which a publisher\r\npaid him with ten pounds' worth of books.  He started a periodical, which\r\nran to six numbers.  He wrote novels.  When he was twenty-eight years old\r\nhis father died, and, being free to take his own course in life, he would\r\nhave entered the army if his mother had not opposed.  He settled down,\r\ntherefore, to farming, and applied to farming all his zealous energy for\r\nreform, and all the labours of his busy pen.  In 1768, a year before his\r\nfather's death, he had published \"A Six Weeks' Tour through the Southern\r\nCounties of England and Wales,\" which found many readers.\r\n\r\nBetween 1768 and 1771 Arthur Young produced also \"The Farmer's Letters to\r\nthe People of England, containing the Sentiments of a Practical\r\nHusbandman on the present State of Husbandry.\"  In 1770 he published, in\r\ntwo thick quartos, \"A Course of Experimental Agriculture, containing an\r\nexact Register of the Business transacted during Five Years on near 300\r\nAcres of various Soils;\" also in the same year appeared \"Rural Economy;\r\nor, Essays on the Practical Part of Husbandry;\" also in the same year\r\n\"The Farmer's Guide in Hiring and Stocking Farms,\" in two volumes, with\r\nplans.  Also in the same year appeared his \"Farmer's Kalendar,\" of which\r\nthe 215th edition was published in 1862.  There had been a second edition\r\nof the \"Six Weeks' Tour in the South of England,\" with enlargements, in\r\n1769, and Arthur Young was encouraged to go on with increasing vigour to\r\nthe publication of \"The Farmer's Tour through the East of England: being\r\na Register of a Journey through various Counties, to inquire into the\r\nState of Agriculture, Manufactures, and Population.\"  This extended to\r\nfour volumes, and appeared in the years 1770 and 1771.  In 1771 also\r\nappeared, in four volumes, with plates, \"A Six Months' Tour through the\r\nNorth of England, containing an Account of the Present State of\r\nAgriculture, Manufactures, and Population in several Counties of this\r\nKingdom.\"\r\n\r\nThus Arthur Young took all his countrymen into counsel while he was\r\nlearning his art, as a farmer who brought to his calling a vigorous\r\nspirit of inquiry with an activity in the diffusion of his thoughts that\r\nis a part of God's gift to the men who have thoughts to diffuse; the\r\ninstinct for utterance being almost invariably joined to the power of\r\nsuggesting what may help the world.\r\n\r\nWhether he was essentially author turned farmer, or farmer turned author,\r\nArthur Young has the first place in English literature as a\r\nfarmer-author.  Other practical men have written practical books of\r\npermanent value, which have places of honour in the literature of the\r\nfarm; but Arthur Young's writings have won friends for themselves among\r\nreaders of every class, and belong more broadly to the literature of the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nBetween 1766 and 1775 he says that he made 3,000 pounds by his\r\nagricultural writings.  The pen brought him more profit than the plough.\r\nHe took a hundred acres in Hertfordshire, and said of them, \"I know not\r\nwhat epithet to give this soil; sterility falls short of the idea; a\r\nhungry vitriolic gravel--I occupied for nine years the jaws of a wolf.  A\r\nnabob's fortune would sink in the attempt to raise good arable crops in\r\nsuch a country.  My experience and knowledge had increased from\r\ntravelling and practice, but all was lost when exerted on such a spot.\"\r\nHe tried at one time to balance his farm losses by reporting for the\r\n_Morning Post_, taking a seventeen-mile walk home to his farm every\r\nSaturday night.\r\n\r\nIn 1780 Arthur Young published this \"Tour in Ireland, with General\r\nObservations on the Present State of that Kingdom in 1776-78.\"  The\r\ngeneral observations, which give to all his books a wide general\r\ninterest, are, in this volume, of especial value to us now.  It is here\r\nreprinted as given by Pinkerton.\r\n\r\nIn 1784 Arthur Young began to edit \"Annals of Agriculture,\" which were\r\ncontinued through forty-five volumes.  All writers in it were to sign\r\ntheir names, but when His Majesty King George III. contributed a\r\ndescription of Mr. Duckett's Farm at Petersham, he was allowed to sign\r\nhimself \"Ralph Robinson of Windsor.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1792 Arthur Young published the first quarto volume, and in 1794 the\r\ntwo volumes of his \"Travels during the years 1787-8-9 and 1790,\r\nundertaken more particularly with a view of ascertaining the Cultivation,\r\nWealth, Resources and National Prosperity of the Kingdom of France.\"\r\nThis led to the official issue in France in 1801, by order of the\r\nDirectory, of a translation of Young's agricultural works, under the\r\ntitle of \"Le Cultivateur Anglais.\"  Arthur Young also corresponded with\r\nWashington, and received recognition from the Empress Catherine of\r\nRussia, who sent him a gold snuff-box, and ermine cloaks for his wife and\r\ndaughter.  He was made a Fellow of the Royal Society.\r\n\r\nIn 1793 his labours led to the formation of a Board of Agriculture, of\r\nwhich he was appointed secretary.\r\n\r\nWhen he was set at ease by this appointment, with a house and 400 pounds\r\na year, Arthur Young had been about to experiment on the reclaiming of\r\nfour thousand acres of Yorkshire moorland.  The Agricultural Board was\r\ndissolved in 1816, four years before surveys of the agriculture of each\r\ncounty were made for the Agricultural Board, Arthur Young himself\r\ncontributing surveys of Hertfordshire, Lincolnshire, Oxfordshire,\r\nNorfolk, Suffolk, and Sussex.\r\n\r\nArthur Young's sight became dim in 1808, and blindness gradually\r\nfollowed.  He died in 1820 at his native village of Bradfield, in\r\nSuffolk, at the age of seventy-nine years.\r\n\r\n                                                                     H. M.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA TOUR IN IRELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\nJune 19, 1776.  Arrived at Holyhead, after an instructive journey through\r\na part of England and Wales I had not seen before.  Found the packet, the\r\n_Claremont_, Captain Taylor, would sail very soon.  After a tedious\r\npassage of twenty-two hours, landed on the 20th in the morning, at\r\nDunlary, four miles from Dublin, a city which much exceeded my\r\nexpectation.  The public buildings are magnificent, very many of the\r\nstreets regularly laid out, and exceedingly well built.  The front of the\r\nParliament-house is grand, though not so light as a more open finishing\r\nof the roof would have made it.  The apartments are spacious, elegant,\r\nand convenient, much beyond that heap of confusion at Westminster, so\r\ninferior to the magnificence to be looked for in the seat of empire.  I\r\nwas so fortunate as to arrive just in time to see Lord Harcourt, with the\r\nusual ceremonies, prorogue the Parliament.  Trinity College is a\r\nbeautiful building, and a numerous society; the library is a very fine\r\nroom, and well filled.  The new Exchange will be another edifice to do\r\nhonour in Ireland; it is elegant, cost forty thousand pounds, but\r\ndeserves a better situation.  From everything I saw, I was struck with\r\nall those appearances of wealth which the capital of a thriving community\r\nmay be supposed to exhibit.  Happy if I find through the country in\r\ndiffused prosperity the right source of this splendour!  The common\r\ncomputation of inhabitants 200,000, but I should suppose exaggerated.\r\nOthers guessed the number 140,000 or 150,000.\r\n\r\nJune 21.  Introduced by Colonel Burton to the Lord Lieutenant, who was\r\npleased to enter into conversation with me on my intended journey, made\r\nmany remarks on the agriculture of several Irish counties, and showed\r\nhimself to be an excellent farmer, particularly in draining.  Viewed the\r\nDuke of Leinster's house, which is a very large stone edifice, the front\r\nsimple but elegant, the pediment light; there are several good rooms; but\r\na circumstance unrivalled is the court, which is spacious and\r\nmagnificent, the opening behind the house is also beautiful.  In the\r\nevening to the Rotunda, a circular room, ninety feet diameter, an\r\nimitation of Ranelagh, provided with a band of music.\r\n\r\nThe barracks are a vast building, raised in a plain style, of many\r\ndivisions; the principal front is of an immense length.  They contain\r\nevery convenience for ten regiments.\r\n\r\nJune 23.  Lord Charlemont's house in Dublin is equally elegant and\r\nconvenient, the apartments large, handsome, and well disposed, containing\r\nsome good pictures, particularly one by Rembrandt, of Judas throwing the\r\nmoney on the floor, with a strong expression of guilt and remorse; the\r\nwhole group fine.  In the same room is a portrait of Caesar Borgia, by\r\nTitian.  The library is a most elegant apartment of about forty by\r\nthirty, and of such a height as to form a pleasing proportion; the light\r\nis well managed, coming in from the cove of the ceiling, and has an\r\nexceeding good effect; at one end is a pretty ante-room, with a fine copy\r\nof the Venus de Medicis, and at the other two small rooms, one a cabinet\r\nof pictures and antiquities, the other medals.  In the collection also of\r\nRobert Fitzgerald, Esq., in Merion Square, are several pieces which very\r\nwell deserve a traveller's attention; it was the best I saw in Dublin.\r\nBefore I quit that city I observe, on the houses in general, that what\r\nthey call their two-roomed ones are good and convenient.  Mr. Latouche's,\r\nin Stephen's Green, I was shown as a model of this sort, and I found it\r\nwell contrived, and finished elegantly.  Drove to Lord Charlemont's villa\r\nat Marino, near the city, where his lordship has formed a pleasing lawn,\r\nmargined in the higher part by a well-planted thriving shrubbery, and on\r\na rising ground a banqueting-room, which ranks very high among the most\r\nbeautiful edifices I have anywhere seen; it has much elegance, lightness,\r\nand effect, and commands a fine prospect.  The rising ground on which it\r\nstands slopes off to an agreeable accompaniment of wood, beyond which on\r\none side is Dublin Harbour, which here has the appearance of a noble\r\nriver crowded with ships moving to and from the capital.  On the other\r\nside is a shore spotted with white buildings, and beyond it the hills of\r\nWicklow, presenting an outline extremely various.  The other part of the\r\nview (it would be more perfect if the city was planted out) is varied, in\r\nsome places nothing but wood, in others breaks of prospect.  The lawn,\r\nwhich is extensive, is new grass, and appears to be excellently laid\r\ndown, the herbage a fine crop of white clover (_trifolium repens_),\r\ntrefoil, rib-grass (_plantago lanceolata_), and other good plants.\r\nReturned to Dublin, and made inquiries into other points, the prices of\r\nprovisions, etc.  The expenses of a family in proportion to those of\r\nLondon are, as five to eight.\r\n\r\nHaving the year following lived more than two months in Dublin, I am able\r\nto speak to a few points, which as a mere traveller I could not have\r\ndone.  The information I before received of the prices of living is\r\ncorrect.  Fish and poultry are plentiful and very cheap.  Good lodgings\r\nalmost as dear as they are in London; though we were well accommodated\r\n(dirt excepted) for two guineas and a-half a week.  All the lower ranks\r\nin this city have no idea of English cleanliness, either in apartments,\r\npersons, or cookery.  There is a very good society in Dublin in a\r\nParliament winter: a great round of dinners and parties; and balls and\r\nsuppers every night in the week, some of which are very elegant; but you\r\nalmost everywhere meet a company much too numerous for the size of the\r\napartments.  They have two assemblies on the plan of those of London, in\r\nFishamble Street, and at the Rotunda; and two gentlemen's clubs, Anthry's\r\nand Daly's, very well regulated: I heard some anecdotes of deep play at\r\nthe latter, though never to the excess common at London.  An ill-judged\r\nand unsuccessful attempt was made to establish the Italian Opera, which\r\nexisted but with scarcely any life for this one winter; of course they\r\ncould rise no higher than a comic one.  _La Buona Figliuola_, _La\r\nFrascatana_, and _Il Geloso in Cimento_, were repeatedly performed, or\r\nrather murdered, except the parts of Sestini.  The house was generally\r\nempty, and miserably cold.  So much knowledge of the state of a country\r\nis gained by hearing the debates of a Parliament, that I often frequented\r\nthe gallery of the House of Commons.  Since Mr. Flood has been silenced\r\nwith the Vice-Treasurership of Ireland, Mr. Daly, Mr. Grattan, Sir\r\nWilliam Osborn, and the prime serjeant Burgh, are reckoned high among the\r\nIrish orators.  I heard many very eloquent speeches, but I cannot say\r\nthey struck me like the exertion of the abilities of Irishmen in the\r\nEnglish House of Commons, owing perhaps to the reflection both on the\r\nspeaker and auditor, that the Attorney-General of England, with a dash of\r\nhis pen, can reverse, alter, or entirely do away the matured result of\r\nall the eloquence, and all the abilities of this whole assembly.  Before\r\nI conclude with Dublin I shall only remark, that walking in the streets\r\nthere, from the narrowness and populousness of the principal\r\nthoroughfares, as well as from the dirt and wretchedness of the canaille,\r\nis a most uneasy and disgusting exercise.\r\n\r\nJune 24.  Left Dublin, and passed through the Phoenix Park, a very\r\npleasing ground, at the bottom of which, to the left, the Liffey forms a\r\nvariety of landscapes: this is the most beautiful environ of Dublin.\r\nTake the road to Luttrel's Town, through a various scenery on the banks\r\nof the river.  That domain is a considerable one in extent, being above\r\nfour hundred acres within the wall, Irish measure; in the front of the\r\nhouse is a fine lawn bounded by rich woods, through which are many\r\nridings, four miles in extent.  From the road towards the house they lead\r\nthrough a very fine glen, by the side of a stream falling over a rocky\r\nbed, through the dark woods, with great variety on the sides of steep\r\nslopes, at the bottom of which the Liffey is either heard or seen\r\nindistinctly.  These woods are of great extent, and so near the capital,\r\nform a retirement exceedingly beautiful.  Lord Irnham and Colonel Luttrel\r\nhave brought in the assistance of agriculture to add to the beauties of\r\nthe place; they have kept a part of the lands in cultivation in order to\r\nlay them down the better to grass; one hundred and fifty acres have been\r\ndone, and above two hundred acres most effectually drained in the covered\r\nmanner filled with stones.  These works are well executed.  The drains\r\nare also made under the roads in all wet places, with lateral short ones\r\nto take off the water instead of leaving it, as is common, to soak\r\nagainst the causeway, which is an excellent method.  Great use has been\r\nmade of limestone gravel in the improvements, the effect of which is so\r\nconsiderable, that in several spots where it was laid on ten years ago,\r\nthe superiority of the grass is now similar to what one would expect from\r\na fresh dunging.\r\n\r\nLeaving Luttrel's Town I went to St. Wolstan's, which Lord Harcourt had\r\nbeen so obliging as to desire I would make my quarters, from whence to\r\nview to the right or left.\r\n\r\nJune 25.  To Mr. Clement's, at Killadoon, who has lately built an\r\nexcellent house, and planted much about it, with the satisfaction of\r\nfinding that all his trees thrive well.  I remarked the beech and larch\r\nseemed to get beyond the rest.  He is also a good farmer.\r\n\r\nJune 26.  Breakfasted with Colonel Marlay, at Cellbridge, found he had\r\npractised husbandry with much success, and given great attention to it\r\nfrom the peace of 1763, which put a period to a gallant scene of service\r\nin Germany.  Walked through his grounds, which I found in general very\r\nwell cultivated; his fences excellent; his ditches five by six and seven\r\nby six; the banks well made, and planted with quicks; the borders dug\r\naway, covered with lime till perfectly slacked, them mixed with dung and\r\ncarried into the fields, a practice which Mr. Marlay has found of very\r\ngreat benefit.\r\n\r\nViewed Lucan, the seat of Agmondisham Vesey, Esq., on the banks of the\r\nLiffey.  The house is rebuilding, but the wood on the river, with walks\r\nthrough it, is exceedingly beautiful.  The character of the place is that\r\nof a sequestered shade.  Distant views are everywhere shut out, and the\r\nobjects all correspond perfectly with the impression they were designed\r\nto raise.  It is a walk on the banks of the river, chiefly under a\r\nvariety of fine wood, which rises on varied slopes, in some parts gentle,\r\nin others steep, spreading here and there into cool meadows, on the\r\nopposite shore, rich banks of wood or shrubby ground.  The walk is\r\nperfectly sequestered, and has that melancholy gloom which should ever\r\ndwell in such a place.  The river is of a character perfectly suited to\r\nthe rest of the scenery, in some places breaking over rocks, in other\r\nsilent, under the thick shade of spreading wood.  Leaving Lucan, the next\r\nplace is Leixlip, a fine one, on the river, with a fall, which in a wet\r\nseason is considerable.  Then St. Wolstan's, belonging to the Dean of\r\nDerry, a beautiful villa, which is also on the river; the grounds gay and\r\nopen, though not without the advantage of much wood, disposed with\r\njudgment.  A winding shrubbery quits the river, and is made to lead\r\nthrough some dressed ground that is pretty and cheerful.\r\n\r\nMr. Conolly's, at Castle Town, to which all travellers resort, is the\r\nfinest house in Ireland, and not exceeded by many in England.  It is a\r\nlarge handsome edifice, situated in the middle of an extensive lawn,\r\nwhich is quite surrounded with fine plantations disposed to the best\r\nadvantage.  To the north these unite into very large woods, through which\r\nmany winding walks lead, with the convenience of several ornamented\r\nseats, rooms, etc.  On the other side of the house, upon the river, is a\r\ncottage, with a shrubbery, prettily laid out; the house commands an\r\nextensive view, bounded by the Wicklow mountains.  It consists of several\r\nnoble apartments.  On the first floor is a beautiful gallery, eighty feet\r\nlong, elegantly fitted up.\r\n\r\nJune 27.  Left Lord Harcourt's, and having received an invitation from\r\nthe Duke of Leinster, passed through Mr. Conolly's grounds to his Grace's\r\nseat at Cartown.  The park ranks among the finest in Ireland.  It is a\r\nvast lawn, which waves over gentle hills, surrounded by plantations of\r\ngreat extent, and which break and divide in places so as to give much\r\nvariety.  A large but gentle vale winds through the whole, in the bottom\r\nof which a small stream has been enlarged into a fine river, which throws\r\na cheerfulness through most of the scenes: over it a handsome stone\r\nbridge.  There is a great variety on the banks of this vale; part of it\r\nconsists of mild and gentle slopes, part steep banks of thick wood.  In\r\nanother place they are formed into a large shrubbery, very elegantly laid\r\nout, and dressed in the highest order, with a cottage, the scenery about\r\nwhich is uncommonly pleasing: and farther on this vale takes a stronger\r\ncharacter, having a rocky bank on one side, and steep slopes scattered\r\nirregularly, with wood on the other.  On one of the most rising grounds\r\nin the park is a tower, from the top of which the whole scenery is\r\nbeheld; the park spreads on every side in fine sheets of lawn, kept in\r\nthe highest order by eleven hundred sheep, scattered over with rich\r\nplantations, and bounded by a large margin of wood, through which is a\r\nriding.\r\n\r\nFrom hence took the road to Summerhill, the seat of the Right Hon. H. L.\r\nRowley.  The country is cheerful and rich; and if the Irish cabins\r\ncontinue like what I have hitherto seen, I shall not hesitate to\r\npronounce their inhabitants as well off as most English cottagers.  They\r\nare built of mud walls eighteen inches or two feet thick, and well\r\nthatched, which are far warmer than the thin clay walls in England.  Here\r\nare few cottars without a cow, and some of them two.  A bellyful\r\ninvariably of potatoes, and generally turf for fuel from a bog.  It is\r\ntrue they have not always chimneys to their cabins, the door serving for\r\nthat and window too.  If their eyes are not affected with the smoke, it\r\nmay be an advantage in warmth.  Every cottage swarms with poultry, and\r\nmost of them have pigs.\r\n\r\nWent in the evening to Lord Mornington's at Dangan, who is making many\r\nimprovements, which he showed me.  His plantations are extensive, and he\r\nhas formed a large water, having five or six islands much varied, and\r\npromontories of high land shoot so far into it as to form almost distant\r\nlakes; the effect pleasing.  There are above a hundred acres under water,\r\nand his lordship has planned a considerable addition to it.  Returned to\r\nSummerhill.\r\n\r\nJune 29.  Left it, taking the road to Slaine, the country very pleasant\r\nall the way; much of it on the banks of the Boyne, variegated with some\r\nwoods, planted hedgerows, and gentle hills.  The cabins continue much the\r\nsame, the same plenty of poultry, pigs, and cows.  The cattle in the road\r\nhave their fore legs all tied together with straw to keep them from\r\nbreaking into the fields; even sheep, and pigs, are all in the same\r\nbondage.\r\n\r\nLord Conyngham's seat, Slaine Castle, on the Boyne, is one of the most\r\nbeautiful places I have seen; the grounds are very bold and various,\r\nrising round the castle in noble hills or beautiful inequalities of\r\nsurface, with an outline of flourishing plantations.  Under the castle\r\nflows the Boyne, in a reach broken by islands, with a very fine shore of\r\nrock on one side, and wood on the other.  Through the lower plantations\r\nare ridings, which look upon several beautiful scenes formed by the\r\nriver, and take in the distant country, exhibiting the noblest views of\r\nwaving Cultinald hills, with the castle finely situated in the midst of\r\nthe planted domain, through which the Boyne winds its beautiful course.\r\n\r\nUnder Mr. Lambert's house on the same river is a most romantic and\r\nbeautiful spot; rocks on the side, rising in peculiar forms very boldly;\r\nthe other steep wood, the river bending short between them like a\r\nland-locked basin.\r\n\r\nLord Conyngham's keeping up Slaine Castle, and spending great sums,\r\nthough he rarely resides there, is an instance of magnificence not often\r\nmet with; while it is so common for absentees to drain the kingdom of\r\nevery shilling they can, so contrary a conduct ought to be held in the\r\nestimation which it justly deserves.\r\n\r\nJune 30.  Rode out to view the country and some improvements in the\r\nneighbourhood: the principal of which are those of Lord Chief Baron\r\nFoster, which I saw from Glaston hill, in the road from Slaine to\r\nDundalk.\r\n\r\nIn conversation with Lord Longford I made many inquiries concerning the\r\nstate of the lower classes, and found that in some respects they were in\r\ngood circumstances, in others indifferent; they have, generally speaking,\r\nsuch plenty of potatoes as always to command a bellyful; they have flax\r\nenough for all their linen, most of them have a cow, and some two, and\r\nspin wool enough for their clothes; all a pig, and numbers of poultry,\r\nand in general the complete family of cows, calves, hogs, poultry, and\r\nchildren pig together in the cabin; fuel they have in the utmost plenty.\r\nGreat numbers of families are also supported by the neighbouring lakes,\r\nwhich abound prodigiously with fish.  A child with a packthread and a\r\ncrooked pin will catch perch enough in an hour for the family to live on\r\nthe whole day, and his lordship has seen five hundred children fishing at\r\nthe same time, there being no tenaciousness in the proprietors of the\r\nlands about a right to the fish.  Besides perch, there is pike upwards of\r\nfive feet long, bream, tench, trout of ten pounds, and as red as salmon,\r\nand fine eels.  All these are favourable circumstances, and are very\r\nconspicuous in the numerous and healthy families among them.\r\n\r\nReverse the medal: they are ill clothed, and make a wretched appearance,\r\nand what is worse, are much oppressed by many who make them pay too dear\r\nfor keeping a cow, horse, etc.  They have a practice also of keeping\r\naccounts with the labourers, contriving by that means to let the poor\r\nwretches have very little cash for their year's work.  This is a great\r\noppression, farmers and gentlemen keeping accounts with the poor is a\r\ncruel abuse: so many days' work for a cabin; so many for a potato garden;\r\nso many for keeping a horse, and so many for a cow, are clear accounts\r\nwhich a poor man can understand well, but farther it ought never to go;\r\nand when he has worked out what he has of this sort, the rest of his work\r\nought punctually to be paid him every Saturday night.  Another\r\ncircumstance mentioned was the excessive practice they have in general of\r\npilfering.  They steal everything they can lay their hands on, and I\r\nshould remark, that this is an account which has been very generally\r\ngiven me: all sorts of iron hinges, chains, locks, keys, etc.; gates will\r\nbe cut in pieces, and conveyed away in many places as fast as built;\r\ntrees as big as a man's body, and that would require ten men to move,\r\ngone in a night.  Lord Longford has had the new wheels of a car stolen as\r\nsoon as made.  Good stones out of a wall will be taken for a fire-hearth,\r\netc., though a breach is made to get at them.  In short, everything, and\r\neven such as are apparently of no use to them; nor is it easy to catch\r\nthem, for they never carry their stolen goods home, but to some bog-hole.\r\nTurnips are stolen by car-loads, and two acres of wheat plucked off in a\r\nnight.  In short, their pilfering and stealing is a perfect nuisance.\r\nHow far it is owing to the oppression of laws aimed solely at the\r\nreligion of these people, how far to the conduct of the gentlemen and\r\nfarmers, and how far to the mischievous disposition of the people\r\nthemselves, it is impossible for a passing traveller to ascertain.  I am\r\napt to believe that a better system of law and management would have good\r\neffects.  They are much worse treated than the poor in England, are\r\ntalked to in more opprobrious terms, and otherwise very much oppressed.\r\n\r\nLeft Packenham Hall.\r\n\r\nTwo or three miles from Lord Longford's in the way to Mullingar the road\r\nleads up a mountain, and commands an exceeding fine view of Lock\r\nDerrevaragh, a noble water eight miles long, and from two miles to half a\r\nmile over; a vast reach of it, like a magnificent river, opens as you\r\nrise the hill.  Afterwards I passed under the principal mountain, which\r\nrises abruptly from the lake into the boldest outline imaginable.  The\r\nwater there is very beautiful, filling up the steep vale formed by this\r\nand the opposite hills.\r\n\r\nReached Mullingar.\r\n\r\nIt was one of the fair days.  I saw many cows and beasts, and more\r\nhorses, with some wool.  The cattle were of the same breed that I had\r\ngenerally seen in coming through the country.\r\n\r\nJuly 5.  Left Mullingar, which is a dirty ugly town, and taking the road\r\nto Tullamore, stopped at Lord Belvidere's, with which place I was as much\r\nstruck as with any I had ever seen.  The house is perched on the crown of\r\na very beautiful little hill, half surrounded with others, variegated and\r\nmelting into one another.  It is one of the most singular places that is\r\nanywhere to be seen, and spreading to the eye a beautiful lawn of\r\nundulating ground margined with wood.  Single trees are scattered in some\r\nplaces, and clumps in others; the general effect so pleasing, that were\r\nthere nothing further, the place would be beautiful, but the canvas is\r\nadmirably filled.  Lake Ennel, many miles in length, and two or three\r\nbroad, flows beneath the windows.  It is spotted with islets, a\r\npromontory of rock fringed with trees shoots into it, and the whole is\r\nbounded by distant hills.  Greater and more magnificent scenes are often\r\nmet with, but nowhere a more beautiful or a more singular one.\r\n\r\nFrom Mullingar to Tullespace I found rents in general at twenty shillings\r\nan acre, with much relet at thirty shillings, yet all the crops except\r\nbere were very bad, and full of weeds.  About the latter-named place the\r\nfarms are generally from one hundred to three hundred acres; and their\r\ncourse: 1. fallow; 2. bere; 3. oats; 4. oats; 5. oats.  Great quantities\r\nof potatoes all the way, crops from forty to eighty barrels.\r\n\r\nThe road before it comes to Tullamore leads through a part of the bog of\r\nAllen, which seems here extensive, and would make a noble tract of\r\nmeadow.  The way the road was made over it was simply to cut a drain on\r\neach side, and then lay on the gravel, which, as fast as it was laid and\r\nspread, bore the ears.  Along the edges is fine white clover.\r\n\r\nIn conversation upon the subject of a union with Great Britain, I was\r\ninformed that nothing was so unpopular in Ireland as such an idea; and\r\nthat the great objection to it was increasing the number of absentees.\r\nWhen it was in agitation, twenty peers and sixty commoners were talked of\r\nto sit in the British Parliament, which would be the resident of eighty\r\nof the best estates in Ireland.  Going every year to England would, by\r\ndegrees, make them residents; they would educate their children there,\r\nand in time become mere absentees: becoming so they would be unpopular,\r\nothers would be elected, who, treading in the same steps, would yield the\r\nplace still to others; and thus by degrees, a vast portion of the kingdom\r\nnow resident would be made absentees, which would, they think, be so\r\ngreat a drain to Ireland, that a free trade would not repay it.\r\n\r\nI think the idea is erroneous, were it only for one circumstance, the\r\nkingdom would lose, according to this reasoning, an idle race of country\r\ngentlemen, and in exchange their ports would fill with ships and\r\ncommerce, and all the consequences of commerce, an exchange that never\r\nyet proved disadvantageous to any country.\r\n\r\nViewed Mount Juliet, Lord Carrick's seat, which is beautifully situated\r\non a fine declivity on the banks of the Nore, commanding some extensive\r\nplantations that spread over the hills, which rise in a various manner on\r\nthe other side of the river.  A knoll of lawn rises among them with\r\nartificial ruins upon it, but the situation is not in unison with the\r\nidea of a ruin, very rarely placed to effect, unless in retired and\r\nmelancholy spots.\r\n\r\nThe river is a very fine one, and has a good accompaniment of well grown\r\nwood.  From the cottage a more varied scene is viewed, cheering and\r\npleasing; and from the tent in the farther plantation a yet gayer one,\r\nwhich looks down on several bends of the river.\r\n\r\nJuly 11.  Left Kilsaine.  Mr. Bushe accompanied me to Woodstock, the seat\r\nof Sir W. Fownes.  From Thomastown hither is the finest ride I have yet\r\nhad in Ireland.  The road leaving Thomastown leads on the east side of\r\nthe river, through some beautiful copse woods, which before they were cut\r\nmust have had a most noble effect, with the river Nore winding at the\r\nbottom.  The country then opens somewhat, and you pass most of the way\r\nfor six or seven miles to Innisteague, on a declivity shelving down to\r\nthe river, which takes a varied winding course, sometimes lively,\r\nbreaking over a rocky bottom, at others still and deep under the gloom of\r\nsome fine woods, which hang down the sides of steep hills.  Narrow slips\r\nof meadow of a beautiful verdure in some places form the shore, and unite\r\nwith cultivated fields that spread over the adjoining hills, reaching\r\nalmost the mountain tops.  These are large and bold, and give in general\r\nto the scenes features of great magnificence.  Passed Sir John Hasler's\r\non the opposite side of the river, finely situated, and Mr. Nicholson's\r\nfarm on this side, who has very extensive copses which line the river.\r\nComing in sight of Sir W. Fownes's, the scenery is striking; the road\r\nmounts the side of the hill, and commands the river at the bottom of the\r\ndeclivity, with groups of trees prettily scattered about, and the little\r\nborough of Innisteague in a most picturesque situation, the whole bounded\r\nby mountains.  Cross the bridge, and going through the town, take a path\r\nthat leads to a small building in the woods, called Mount Sandford.  It\r\nis at the top of a rocky declivity almost perpendicular, but with brush\r\nwood growing from the rocks.  At the bottom is the river, which comes\r\nfrom the right from behind a very bold hanging wood, that seems to unite\r\nwith the hill on the opposite shore.  At this pass the river fills the\r\nvale, but it widens by degrees, and presents various reaches, intermixed\r\nwith little tufts of trees.  The bridge we passed over is half hid.\r\nInnisteague is mixed with them, and its buildings backed by a larger\r\nwood, give variety to the scene.  Opposite to the point of view there are\r\nsome pretty enclosures, fringed with wood, and a line of cultivated\r\nmountain sides, with their bare tops limit the whole.\r\n\r\nTaking my leave of Mr. Bushe, I followed the road to Ross.  Passed\r\nWoodstock, of which there is a very fine view from the top of one of the\r\nhills, the house in the centre of a sloping wood of five hundred English\r\nacres, and hanging in one noble shade to the river, which flows at the\r\nbottom of a winding glen.  From the same hill in front it is seen in a\r\nwinding course for many miles through a great extent of enclosures,\r\nbounded by mountains.  As I advanced the views of the river Nore were\r\nvery fine, till I came to Ross, where from the hill before you go down to\r\nthe ferry is a noble scene of the Barrow, a vast river flowing through\r\nbold shores.  In some places trees on the bank half obscure it, in others\r\nit opens in large reaches, the effect equally grand and beautiful.  Ships\r\nsailing up to the town, which is built on the side of a hill to the\r\nwater's edge, enliven the scene not a little.  The water is very deep and\r\nthe navigation secure, so that ships of seven hundred tons may come up to\r\nthe town; but these noble harbours on the coast of Ireland are only\r\nmelancholy capabilities of commerce: it is languid and trifling.  There\r\nare only four or five brigs and sloops that belong to the place.\r\n\r\nHaving now passed through a considerable extent of country, in which the\r\nWhiteboys were common, and committed many outrages, I shall here review\r\nthe intelligence I received concerning them throughout the county of\r\nKilkenny.  I made many inquiries into the origin of those disturbances,\r\nand found that no such thing as a leveller or Whiteboy was heard of till\r\n1760, which was long after the landing of Thurot, or the intending\r\nexpedition of M. Conflans.  That no foreign coin was ever seen among\r\nthem, though reports to the contrary were circulated; and in all the\r\nevidence that was taken during ten or twelve years, in which time there\r\nappeared a variety of informers, none was ever taken, whose testimony\r\ncould be relied on, that ever proved any foreign interposition.  Those\r\nvery few who attempted to favour it, were of the most infamous and\r\nperjured characters.  All the rest, whose interest it was to make the\r\ndiscovery, if they had known it, and who concealed nothing else,\r\npretended to no such knowledge.  No foreign money appeared, no arms of\r\nforeign construction, no presumptive proof whatever of such a connection.\r\nThey began in Tipperary, and were owing to some inclosures of commons,\r\nwhich they threw down, levelling the ditches, and were first known by the\r\nname of Levellers.  After that, they began with the tithe-proctors (who\r\nare men that hire tithes of the rectors), and these proctors either\r\nscrewed the cottars up to the utmost shilling, or relet the tithes to\r\nsuch as did it.  It was a common practice with them to go in parties\r\nabout the country, swearing many to be true to them, and forcing them to\r\njoin by menaces, which they very often carried into execution.  At last\r\nthey set up to be general redressers of grievances, punished all\r\nobnoxious persons who advanced the value of lands, or hired farms over\r\ntheir heads; and, having taken the administration of justice into their\r\nhands, were not very exact in the distribution of it.  Forced masters to\r\nrelease their apprentices, carried off the daughters of rich farmers, and\r\nravished them into marriages, of which four instances happened in a\r\nfortnight.  They levied sums of money on the middling and lower farmers\r\nin order to support their cause, by paying attorneys, etc., in defending\r\nprosecutions against them; and many of them subsisted for some years\r\nwithout work, supported by these contributions.  Sometimes they committed\r\nseveral considerable robberies, breaking into houses, and taking the\r\nmoney, under pretence of redressing grievances.  In the course of these\r\noutrages they burnt several houses, and destroyed the whole substance of\r\nmen obnoxious to them.  The barbarities they committed were shocking.\r\nOne of their usual punishments (and by no means the most severe) was\r\ntaking people out of their beds, carrying them naked in winter on\r\nhorseback for some distance, and burying them up to their chin in a hole\r\nfilled with briars, not forgetting to cut off their ears.  In this manner\r\nthe evil existed for eight or ten years, during which time the gentlemen\r\nof the country took some measures to quell them.  Many of the magistrates\r\nwere active in apprehending them; but the want of evidence prevented\r\npunishments, for many of those who even suffered by them had no spirit to\r\nprosecute.  The gentlemen of the country had frequent expeditions to\r\ndiscover them in arms; but their intelligence was so uncommonly good by\r\ntheir influence over the common people, that not one party that ever went\r\nout in quest of them was successful.  Government offered large rewards\r\nfor informations, which brought a few every year to the gallows, without\r\nany radical cure for the evil.  The reason why it was not more effective\r\nwas the necessity of any person that gave evidence against them quitting\r\ntheir houses and country, or remaining exposed to their resentment.  At\r\nlast their violence arose to a height which brought on their suppression.\r\nThe popish inhabitants of Ballyragget, six miles from Kilkenny, were the\r\nfirst of the lower people who dared openly to associate against them;\r\nthey threatened destruction to the town, gave notice that they would\r\nattack it, were as good as their word, came two hundred strong, drew up\r\nbefore a house in which were fifteen armed men, and fired in at the\r\nwindows; the fifteen men handled their arms so well, that in a few rounds\r\nthey killed forty or fifty.  They fled immediately, and ever after left\r\nBallyragget in peace: indeed, they have never been resisted at all\r\nwithout showing a great want of both spirit and discipline.  It should,\r\nhowever, be observed, that they had but very few arms, those in bad\r\norder, and no cartridges.  Soon after this they attacked the house of Mr.\r\nPower in Tipperary, the history of which is well known.  His murder\r\nspirited up the gentlemen to exert themselves in suppressing the evil,\r\nespecially in raising subscriptions to give private rewards to whoever\r\nwould give evidence or information concerning them.  The private\r\ndistribution had much more effect than larger sums which required a\r\npublic declaration; and Government giving rewards to those who resisted\r\nthem, without having previously promised it, had likewise some effect.\r\nLaws were passed for punishing all who assembled, and (what may have a\r\ngreat effect) for recompensing, at the expense of the county or barony,\r\nall persons who suffered by their outrages.  In consequence of this\r\ngeneral exertion, above twenty were capitally convicted, and most of them\r\nexecuted; and the gaols of this and the three neighbouring counties,\r\nCarlow, Tipperary, and Queen's County, have many in them whose trials are\r\nput off till next assizes, and against whom sufficient evidence for\r\nconviction, it is supposed, will appear.  Since this all has been quiet,\r\nand no outrages have been committed: but before I quit the subject, it is\r\nproper to remark that what coincided very much to abate the evil was the\r\nfall in the price of lands which has taken place lately.  This is\r\nconsiderable, and has much lessened the evil of hiring farms over the\r\nheads of one another; perhaps, also, the tithe-proctors have not been\r\nquite so severe in their extortions: but this observation is by no means\r\ngeneral; for in many places tithes yet continue to be levied with all\r\nthose circumstances which originally raised the evil.\r\n\r\nJuly 15.  Leaving Courtown, took the Arklow road; passed a finely wooded\r\npark of Mr. Ram's, and a various country with some good corn in it.  Flat\r\nlands by the coast let very high, and mountain at six or seven shillings\r\nan acre, and some at eight shillings or ten shillings.  Passed to\r\nWicklow, prettily situated on the sea, and from Newrybridge walked to see\r\nMr. Tye's, which is a neat farm, well wooded, with a river running\r\nthrough the fields.\r\n\r\nReached in the evening Mount Kennedy, the seat of General Cunninghame,\r\nwho fortunately proved to me an instructor as assiduous as he is able.\r\nHe is in the midst of a country almost his own, for he has 10,000 Irish\r\nacres here.  His domain, and the grounds about it, are very beautiful;\r\nnot a level can be seen; every spot is tossed about in a variety of hill\r\nand dale.  In the middle of the lawn is one of the greatest natural\r\ncuriosities in the kingdom: an immense arbutus tree, unfortunately blown\r\ndown, but yet vegetating.  One branch, which parts from the body near the\r\nground, and afterwards into many large branches, is six feet two inches\r\nin circumference.  The General buried part of the stem as it laid, and it\r\nis from several branches throwing out fine young shoots: it is a most\r\nvenerable remnant.  Killarney, the region of the arbutus, boasts of no\r\nsuch tree as this.\r\n\r\nJuly 16.  Rode in the morning to Drum; a large extent of mountains and\r\nwood on the General's estate.  It is a very noble scenery; a vast rocky\r\nglen; one side bare rocks to an immense height, hanging in a thousand\r\nwhimsical yet frightful forms, with vast fragments tumbled from them, and\r\nlying in romantic confusion; the other a fine mountain side covered with\r\nshrubby wood.  This wild pass leads to the bottom of an amphitheatre of\r\nmountain, which exhibits a very noble scenery.  To the right is an\r\nimmense sweep of mountain completely wooded; taken as a single object it\r\nis a most magnificent one, but its forms are picturesque in the highest\r\ndegree; great projections of hill, with glens behind all wooded, have a\r\nnoble effect.  Every feature of the whole view is great, and unites to\r\nform a scene of natural magnificence.  From hence a riding is cut through\r\nthe hanging wood, which rises to a central spot, where the General has\r\ncleared away the rubbish from under the wood, and made a beautiful waving\r\nlawn with many oaks and hollies scattered about it: here he has built a\r\ncottage, a pretty, whimsical oval room, from the windows of which are\r\nthree views, one of distant rich lands opening to the sea, one upon a\r\ngreat mountain, and a third upon a part of the lawn.  It is well placed,\r\nand forms upon the whole a most agreeable retreat.\r\n\r\nJuly 17.  Took my leave of General Cunninghame, and went through the glen\r\nof the downs in my way to Powerscourt.  The glen is a pass between two\r\nvast ridges of mountains covered with wood, which have a very noble\r\neffect.  The vale is no wider than to admit the road, a small gurgling\r\nriver almost by its side, and narrow slips of rocky and shrubby ground\r\nwhich part them.  In the front all escape seems denied by an immense\r\nconical mountain, which rises out of the glen and seems to fill it up.\r\nThe scenery is of a most magnificent character.  On the top of the ridge\r\nto the right Mr. La Touche has a banqueting-room.  Passing from this\r\nsublime scene, the road leads through cheerful grounds all under corn,\r\nrising and falling to the eye, and then to a vale of charming verdure\r\nbroken into inclosures, and bounded by two rocky mountains, distant\r\ndarker mountains filling up the scene in front.  This whole ride is\r\ninteresting, for within a mile and a half of \"Tinnyhinch\" (the inn to\r\nwhich I was directed), you come to a delicious view on the right: a small\r\nvale opening to the sea, bounded by mountains, whose dark shade forms a\r\nperfect contrast to the extreme beauty and lively verdure of the lower\r\nscene, consisting of gently swelling lawns rising from each other, with\r\ngroups of trees between, and the whole so prettily scattered with white\r\nfarms, as to add every idea of cheerfulness.  Kept on towards\r\nPowerscourt, which presently came in view from the edge of a declivity.\r\nYou look full upon the house, which appears to be in the most beautiful\r\nsituation in the world, on the side of a mountain, half-way between its\r\nbare top and an irriguous vale at its foot.  In front, and spreading\r\namong woods on either side, is a lawn whose surface is beautifully varied\r\nin gentle declivities, hanging to a winding river.\r\n\r\nLowering the hill the scenery is yet more agreeable.  The near inclosures\r\nare margined with trees, through whose open branches are seen whole\r\nfields of the most lively verdure.  The trees gather into groups, and the\r\nlawn swells into gentle inequalities, while the river winding beneath\r\nrenders the whole truly pleasing.\r\n\r\nBreakfasted at the inn at Tinnyhinch, and then drove to the park to see\r\nthe waterfall.  The park itself is fine; you enter it between two vast\r\nmasses of mountain, covered with wood, forming a vale scattered with\r\ntrees, through which flows a river on a broken rocky channel.  You follow\r\nthis vale till it is lost in a most uncommon manner; the ridges of\r\nmountain, closing, form one great amphitheatre of wood, from the top of\r\nwhich, at the height of many hundred feet, bursts the water from a rock,\r\nand tumbling down the side of a very large one, forms a scene singularly\r\nbeautiful.  At the bottom is a spot of velvet turf, from which rises a\r\nclump of oaks, and through their stems, branches and leaves, the falling\r\nwater is seen as a background, with an effect more picturesque than can\r\nbe well imagined.  These few trees, and this little lawn, give the\r\nfinishing to the scene.  The water falls behind some large fragments of\r\nrock, and turns to the left, down a stony channel, under the shade of a\r\nwood.\r\n\r\nReturning to Tinnyhinch, I went to Inniskerry, and gained by this detour\r\nin my return to go to the Dargle, a beautiful view which I should\r\notherwise have lost.  The road runs on the edge of a declivity, from\r\nwhence there is a most pleasing prospect of the river's course through\r\nthe vale and the wood of Powerscourt, which here appear in large masses\r\nof dark shade, the whole bounded by mountains.  Turn to the left into the\r\nprivate road that leads to the Dargle, and presently it gives a specimen\r\nof what is to be expected by a romantic glen of wood, where the high\r\nlands almost lock into each other, and leave scarce a passage for the\r\nriver at bottom, which rages as if with difficulty forcing its way.  It\r\nis topped by a high mountain, and in front you catch a beautiful plat of\r\ninclosures bounded by the sea.  Enter the Dargle, which is the name of a\r\nglen near a mile long, come presently to one of the finest ranges of wood\r\nI have anywhere seen.  It is a narrow glen or vale formed by the sides of\r\ntwo opposite mountains; the whole thickly spread with oak wood.  At the\r\nbottom (and the depth is immense), it is narrowed to the mere channel of\r\nthe river, which rather tumbles from rock to rock than runs.  The extent\r\nof wood that hangs to the eye in every direction is great, the depth of\r\nthe precipice on which you stand immense, which with the roar of the\r\nwater at bottom forms a scene truly interesting.  In less than a quarter\r\nof a mile, the road passing through the wood leads to another point of\r\nview to the right.  It is the crown of a vast projecting rock, from which\r\nyou look down a precipice absolutely perpendicular, and many hundred feet\r\ndeep, upon the torrent at the bottom, which finds its noisy way over\r\nlarge fragments of rock.  The point of view is a great projection of the\r\nmountain on this side, answered by a concave of the opposite, so that you\r\ncommand the glen both to the right and left.  It exhibits on both immense\r\nsheets of forest, which have a most magnificent appearance.  Beyond the\r\nwood to the right, are some inclosures hanging on the side of a hill,\r\ncrowned by a mountain.  I knew not how to leave so interesting a spot;\r\nthe impressions raised by it are strong.  The solemnity of such an extent\r\nof wood unbroken by any intervening objects, and the whole hanging over\r\ndeclivities, is alone great; but to this the addition of a constant roar\r\nof falling water, either quite hid, or so far below as to be seen but\r\nobscurely, united to make those impressions stronger.  No contradictory\r\nemotions are raised; no ill-judged temples appear to enliven a scene that\r\nis gloomy rather than gay.  Falling or moving water is a lively object;\r\nbut this being obscure the noise operates differently.  Following the\r\nroad a little further, there is another bold rocky projection from which\r\nalso there is a double view to the right and left.  In front so immense a\r\nsweep of hanging wood, that a nobler scene can hardly be imagined; the\r\nriver as before, at the bottom of the precipice, which is so steep and\r\nthe depth so great as to be quite fearful to look down.  This horrid\r\nprecipice, the pointed bleak mountains in view, with the roar of the\r\nwater, all conspire to raise one great emotion of the sublime.  You\r\nadvance scarcely twenty yards before a pretty scene opens to the left--a\r\ndistant landscape of inclosures, with a river winding between the hills\r\nto the sea.  Passing to the right, fresh scenes of wood appear; half-way\r\nto the bottom, one different from the preceding is seen; you are almost\r\ninclosed in wood, and look to the right through some low oaks on the\r\nopposite bank of wood, with an edging of trees through which the sky is\r\nseen, which, added to an uncommon elegance in the outline of the hill,\r\nhas a most pleasing effect.  Winding down to a thatched bench on a rocky\r\npoint, you look upon an uncommon scene.  Immediately beneath is a vast\r\nchasm in the rock, which seems torn asunder to let the torrent through\r\nthat comes tumbling over a rocky bed far sunk into a channel embosomed in\r\nwood.  Above is a range of gloomy obscure woods, which half overshadow\r\nit, and rising to a vast height, exclude every object.  To the left the\r\nwater rolls away over broken rocks--a scene duly romantic.  Followed the\r\npath: it led me to the water's edge, at the bottom of the glen, where is\r\na new scene, in which not a single circumstance hurts the principal\r\ncharacter.  In a hollow formed of rock and wood (every object excluded\r\nbut those and water) the torrent breaks forth from fragments of rock, and\r\ntumbles through the chasm, rocks bulging over it as if ready to fall into\r\nthe channel and stop the impetuous water.  The shade is so thick as to\r\nexclude the heavens; all is retired and gloomy, a brown horror breathing\r\nover the whole.  It is a spot for melancholy to muse in.\r\n\r\nReturn to the carriage, and quit the Dargle, which upon the whole is a\r\nvery singular place, different from all I have seen in England, and I\r\nthink preferable to most.  Cross a murmuring stream, clear as crystal,\r\nand, rising a hill, look back on a pleasing landscape of inclosures,\r\nwhich, waving over hills, end in mountains of a very noble character.\r\nReach Dublin.\r\n\r\nJuly 20.  To Drogheda, a well-built town, active in trade, the Boyne\r\nbringing ships to it.  It was market-day, and I found the quantity of\r\ncorn, etc., and the number of people assembled, very great; few country\r\nmarkets in England more thronged.  The Rev. Mr. Nesbit, to whom\r\nrecommended, absent, which was a great loss to me, as I had several\r\ninquiries which remained unsatisfied.\r\n\r\nTo the field of battle on the Boyne.  The view of the scene from a rising\r\nground which looks down upon it is exceedingly beautiful, being one of\r\nthe completest landscapes I have seen.  It is a vale, losing itself in\r\nfront between bold declivities, above which are some thick woods and\r\ndistant country.  Through the vale the river winds and forms an island,\r\nthe point of which is tufted with trees in the prettiest manner\r\nimaginable; on the other side a rich scenery of wood, among which is Dr.\r\nNorris's house.  To the right, on a rising ground on the banks of the\r\nriver, is the obelisk, backed by a very bold declivity.  Pursued the road\r\ntill near it, quitted my chaise, and walked to the foot of it.  It is\r\nfounded on a rock which rises boldly from the river.  It is a noble\r\npillar, and admirably placed.  I seated myself on the opposite rock, and\r\nindulged the emotions which, with a melancholy not unpleasing, filled my\r\nbosom, while I reflected on the consequences that had sprung from the\r\nvictory here obtained.  Liberty was then triumphant.  May the virtues of\r\nour posterity secure that prize which the bravery of their ancestors won!\r\nPeace to the memory of the Prince to whom, whatever might be his\r\nfailings, we owed that day memorable in the annals of Europe!\r\n\r\nReturned part of the way, and took the road to Cullen, where the Lord\r\nChief Baron Forster received me in the most obliging manner, and gave me\r\na variety of information uncommonly valuable.  He has made the greatest\r\nimprovements I have anywhere met with.  The whole country twenty-two\r\nyears ago was a waste sheep-walk, covered chiefly with heath, with some\r\ndwarf furze and fern.  The cabins and people as miserable as can be\r\nconceived; not a Protestant in the country, nor a road passable for a\r\ncarriage.  In a word, perfectly resembling other mountainous tracts, and\r\nthe whole yielding a rent of not more than from three shillings to four\r\nshillings an acre.  Mr. Forster could not bear so barren a property, and\r\ndetermined to attempt the improvement of an estate of five thousand acres\r\ntill then deemed irreclaimable.  He encouraged the tenants by every\r\nspecies of persuasion and expense, but they had so ill an opinion of the\r\nland that he was forced to begin with two or three thousand acres in his\r\nown hands; he did not, however, turn out the people, but kept them in to\r\nsee the effects of his operations.\r\n\r\nTo Dundalk.  The view down on this town also very beautiful: swelling\r\nhills of a fine verdure, with many rich inclosures backed by a bold\r\noutline of mountain that is remarkable.  Laid at the Clanbrassil Arms,\r\nand found it a very good inn.  The place, like most of the Irish towns I\r\nhave been in, full of new buildings, with every mark of increasing wealth\r\nand prosperity.  A cambric manufacture was established here by\r\nParliament, but failed; it was, however, the origin of that more to the\r\nnorth.\r\n\r\nJuly 22.  Left Dundalk, took the road through Ravensdale to Mr.\r\nFortescue, to whom I had a letter, but unfortunately he was in the South\r\nof Ireland.  Here I saw many good stone and slate houses, and some bleach\r\ngreens; and I was much pleased to see the inclosures creeping high up the\r\nsides of the mountains, stony as they are.  Mr. Fortescue's situation is\r\nvery romantic--on the side of a mountain, with fine wood hanging on every\r\nside, with the lawn beautifully scattered with trees spreading into them,\r\nand a pretty river winding through the vale, beautiful in itself, but\r\ntrebly so on information that before he fixed there it was all a wild\r\nwaste.  Rents in Ravensdale ten shillings; mountain land two shillings\r\nand sixpence to five shillings.  Also large tracts rented by villages,\r\nthe cottars dividing it among themselves, and making the mountain common\r\nfor their cattle.\r\n\r\nBreakfasted at Newry--the Globe, another good inn.  This town appears\r\nexceedingly flourishing, and is very well built; yet forty years ago, I\r\nwas told, there were nothing but mud cabins in it.  This great rise has\r\nbeen much owing to the canal to Loch Neagh.  I crossed it twice; it is\r\nindeed a noble work.  I was amazed to see ships of one hundred and fifty\r\ntons and more lying in it, like barges in an English canal.  Here is a\r\nconsiderable trade.\r\n\r\nReached Armagh in the evening, and waited on the Primate.\r\n\r\nJuly 23.  His Grace rode out with me to Armagh, and showed me some of the\r\nnoble and spirited works by which he has perfectly changed the face of\r\nthe neighbourhood.  The buildings he has erected in seven years, one\r\nwould suppose, without previous information, to be the work of an active\r\nlife.  A list of them will justify this observation.\r\n\r\nHe has erected a very elegant palace, ninety feet by sixty, and forty\r\nhigh, in which an unadorned simplicity reigns.  It is light and pleasing,\r\nwithout the addition of wings or lesser parts, which too frequently\r\nwanting a sufficient uniformity with the body of the edifice, are\r\nunconnected with it in effect, and divide the attention.  Large and ample\r\noffices are conveniently placed behind a plantation at a small distance.\r\nAround the palace is a large lawn, which spreads on every side over the\r\nhills, and is skirted by young plantations, in one of which is a terrace,\r\nwhich commands a most beautiful view of cultivated hill and dale.  The\r\nview from the palace is much improved by the barracks, the school, and a\r\nnew church at a distance, all which are so placed as to be exceedingly\r\nornamental to the whole country.\r\n\r\nThe barracks were erected under his Grace's directions, and form a large\r\nand handsome edifice.  The school is a building of considerable extent,\r\nand admirably adapted for the purpose: a more convenient or a better\r\ncontrived one is nowhere to be seen.  There are apartments for a master,\r\na school-room fifty-six feet by twenty-eight, a large dining-room, and\r\nspacious, airy dormitories, with every other necessary, and a spacious\r\nplayground walled in; the whole forming a handsome front: and attention\r\nbeing paid to the residence of the master (the salary is four hundred\r\npounds a year), the school flourishes, and must prove one of the greatest\r\nadvantages to the country of anything that could have been established.\r\nThis edifice entirely at the Primate's expense.  The church is erected of\r\nwhite stone, and having a tall spire makes a very agreeable object in a\r\ncountry where churches and spires do not abound--at least, such as are\r\nworth looking at.  Three other churches the Primate has also built, and\r\ndone considerable reparations to the cathedral.\r\n\r\nHe has been the means also of erecting a public infirmary, which was\r\nbuilt by subscription, contributing amply to it himself.\r\n\r\nA public library he has erected at his own expense, given a large\r\ncollection of books, and endowed it.  The room is excellently adapted,\r\nforty-five feet by twenty-five, and twenty high, with a gallery, and\r\napartments for a librarian.\r\n\r\nHe has further ornamented the city with a market-house and shambles, and\r\nbeen the direct means, by giving leases upon that condition, of almost\r\nnew-building the whole place.  He found it a nest of mud cabins, and he\r\nwill leave it a well-built city of stone and slate.  I heard it asserted\r\nin common conversation that his Grace, in these noble undertakings, had\r\nnot expended less than thirty thousand pounds, besides what he had been\r\nthe means of doing, though not directly at his own expense.\r\n\r\nIn the evening reached Mr. Brownlow's at Lurgan, to whom I am indebted\r\nfor some valuable information.  This gentleman has made very great\r\nimprovements in his domain.  He has a lake at the bottom of a slight\r\nvale, and around are three walks, at a distance from each other; the\r\ncentre one is the principal, and extends two miles.  It is well conducted\r\nfor leading to the most agreeable parts of the grounds, and for\r\ncommanding views of Loch Neagh, and the distant country.  There are\r\nseveral buildings, a temple, green-house, etc.  The most beautiful scene\r\nis from a bench on a gently swelling hill, which rises almost on every\r\nside from the water.  The wood, the water, and the green slopes, here\r\nunite to form a very pleasing landscape.  Let me observe one thing much\r\nto his honour; he advances his tenants money for all the lime they\r\nchoose, and takes payment in eight years with rent.\r\n\r\nUpon inquiring concerning the emigrations, I found that in 1772 and 1773\r\nthey were at the height; that some went from this neighbourhood with\r\nproperty, but not many.  They were in general poor and unemployed.  They\r\nfind here that when provisions are very cheap, the poor spend much of\r\ntheir time in whisky-houses.  All the drapers wish that oatmeal was never\r\nunder one penny a pound.  Though farms are exceedingly divided, yet few\r\nof the people raise oatmeal enough to feed themselves; all go to market\r\nfor some.  The weavers earn by coarse linens one shilling a day, by fine\r\none shilling and fourpence, and it is the same with the spinners--the\r\nfiner the yarn, the more they earn; but in common a woman earns about\r\nthreepence.  For coarse linens they do not reckon the flax hurt by\r\nstanding for seed.  Their own flax is much better than the imported.\r\n\r\nThis country is in general beautiful, but particularly so about the\r\nstraits that lead into Strangford Loch.  From Mr. Savage's door the view\r\nhas great variety.  To the left are tracts of hilly grounds, between\r\nwhich the sea appears, and the vast chain of mountains in the Isle of Man\r\ndistinctly seen.  In front the hills rise in a beautiful outline, and a\r\nround hill projects like a promontory into the strait, and under it the\r\ntown amidst groups of trees; the scene is cheerful of itself, but\r\nrendered doubly so by the ships and herring-boats sailing in and out.  To\r\nthe right the view is crowned by the mountains of Mourne, which, wherever\r\nseen, are of a character peculiarly bold, and even terrific.  The shores\r\nof the loch behind Mr. Savage's are bold ground, abounding with numerous\r\npleasing landscapes; the opposite coast, consisting of the woods and\r\nimprovements of Castle Ward, is a fine scenery.\r\n\r\nCalled at Lord Bangor's, at Castle Ward, to deliver a letter of\r\nrecommendations but unfortunately he was on a sailing party to England;\r\nwalked through the woods, etc.  The house was built by the present lord.\r\nIt is a very handsome edifice, with two principal fronts, but not of the\r\nsame architecture, for the one is Gothic and the other Grecian.  From the\r\ntemple is a fine wooded scene: you look down on a glen of wood, with a\r\nwinding hill quite covered with it, and which breaks the view of a large\r\nbay.  Over it appears the peninsula of Strangford, which consists of\r\nenclosures and wood.  To the right the bay is bounded by a fine grove,\r\nwhich projects into it.  A ship at anchor added much.  The house well\r\nsituated above several rising woods; the whole scene a fine one.  I\r\nremarked in Lord Bangor's domains a fine field of turnips, but unhoed.\r\nThere were some cabbages also.\r\n\r\nBelfast is a very well built town of brick, they having no stone quarry\r\nin the neighbourhood.  The streets are broad and straight, and the\r\ninhabitants, amounting to about fifteen thousand, make it appear lively\r\nand busy.  The public buildings are not numerous nor very striking, but\r\nover the exchange Lord Donegal is building an assembly room, sixty feet\r\nlong by thirty broad, and twenty-four high; a very elegant room.  A\r\ncard-room adjoining, thirty by twenty-two, and twenty-two high; a\r\ntea-room of the same size.  His lordship is also building a new church,\r\nwhich is one of the lightest and most pleasing I have anywhere seen: it\r\nis seventy-four by fifty-four, and thirty high to the cornice, the aisles\r\nseparated by a double row of columns; nothing can be lighter or more\r\npleasing.  The town belongs entirely to his lordship.  Rent of it 2,000\r\npounds a year.  His estate extends from Drumbridge, near Lisburn, to\r\nLarne, twenty miles in a right line, and is ten broad.  His royalties are\r\ngreat, containing the whole of Loch Neagh, which is, I suppose, the\r\ngreatest of any subject in Europe.  His eel fishery at Tome, and Port\r\nNew, on the river Ban, lets for 500 pounds a year; and all the fisheries\r\nare his to the leap at Coleraine.  The estate is supposed to be 31,000\r\npounds a year, the greatest at present in Ireland.  Inishowen, in\r\nDonegal, is his, and is 11,000 pounds of it.  In Antrim, Lord Antrim's is\r\nthe most extensive property, being four baronies, and one hundred and\r\nseventy-three thousand acres.  The rent 8,000 pounds a year, but re-let\r\nfor 64,000 pounds a year, by tenants that have perpetuities, perhaps the\r\ncruellest instance in the world of carelessness for the interests of\r\nposterity.  The present lord's father granted those leases.\r\n\r\nI was informed that Mr. Isaac, near Belfast, had four acres, Irish\r\nmeasure, of strong clay land not broken up for many years, which being\r\namply manured with lime rubbish and sea shells, and fallowed, was sown\r\nwith wheat, and yielded 87 pounds 9s. at 9s. to 12s. per cwt.  Also that\r\nMr. Whitley, of Ballinderry, near Lisburn, a tenant of Lord Hertford's,\r\nhas rarely any wheat that does not yield him 18 pounds an acre.  The\r\ntillage of the neighbourhood for ten miles round is doubled in a few\r\nyears.  Shall export one thousand tons of corn this year from Belfast,\r\nmost of it to the West Indies, particularly oats.\r\n\r\nAugust 1.  To Arthur Buntin's, Esq., near Belfast; the soil a stiff clay;\r\nlets at old rents 10s., new one 18s., the town parks of that place 30s.\r\nto 70s., ten miles round it 10s. to 20s., average 13s.  A great deal of\r\nflax sown, every countryman having a little, always on potato land, and\r\none ploughing: they usually sow each family a bushel of seed.  Those who\r\nhave no land pay the farmers 20s. rent for the land a bushel of seed\r\nsows, and always on potato land.  They plant many more potatoes than they\r\neat, to supply the market at Belfast; manure for them with all their\r\ndung, and some of them mix dung, earth, and lime, and this is found to do\r\nbetter.  There is much alabaster near the town, which is used for stucco\r\nplaster; sells from 1 pound 1s. to 25s. a ton.\r\n\r\nOn my way to Antrim, viewed the bleach green of Mr. Thomas Sinclair; it\r\nis the completest I have seen here.  I understood that the bleaching\r\nseason lasted nine months, and that watering on the grass was quite left\r\noff.  Mr. Sinclair himself was not at home, or I should probably have\r\ngained some intelligence that might have been useful.\r\n\r\nCrossed the mountains by the new road to Antrim, and found them to the\r\nsummits to consist of exceeding good loam, and such as would improve into\r\ngood meadow.  It is all thrown to the little adjoining farms, with very\r\nlittle or any rent paid for it.  They make no other use of it than\r\nturning their cows on.  Pity they do not improve; a work more profitable\r\nthan any they could undertake.  All the way to Antrim lands let, at an\r\naverage, at 8s.  The linen manufacture spreads over the whole country,\r\nconsequently the farms are very small, being nothing but patches for the\r\nconvenience of weavers.\r\n\r\nFrom Antrim to Shanes Castle the road runs at the end of Loch Neagh,\r\ncommanding a noble view of it; of such an extent that the eye can see no\r\nland over it.  It appears like a perfect sea, and the shore is broken\r\nsand-banks, which look so much like it, that one can hardly believe the\r\nwater to be fresh.  Upon my arrival at the castle, I was most agreeably\r\nsaluted with four men hoeing a field of turnips round it, as a\r\npreparation for grass.  These were the first turnip-hoers I have seen in\r\nIreland, and I was more pleased than if I had seen four emperors.\r\n\r\nThe castle is beautifully situated on the lake, the windows commanding a\r\nvery noble view of it; and this has the finer effect, as the woods are\r\nconsiderable, and form a fine accompaniment to this noble inland sea.\r\n\r\nRode from Mr. Lesly's to view the Giant's Causeway.  It is certainly a\r\nvery great curiosity as an object for speculation upon the manner of its\r\nformation; whether it owes its origin to fire, and is a species of lava,\r\nor to crystallisation, or to whatever cause, is a point that has employed\r\nthe attention of men much more able to decide upon it than I am; and has\r\nbeen so often treated, that nothing I could say could be new.  When two\r\nbits of these basalts are rubbed together quick, they emit a considerable\r\nscent like burnt leather.  The scenery of the Causeway, nor of the\r\nadjacent mountains, is very magnificent, though the cliffs are bold; but\r\nfor a considerable distance there is a strong disposition in the rocks to\r\nrun into pentagonal cylinders, and even at a bridge by Mr. Lesly's is a\r\nrock in which the same disposition is plainly visible.  I believe the\r\nCauseway would have struck me more if I had not seen the prints of\r\nStaffa.\r\n\r\nReturned to Lesly Hill, and on August 5th departed for Coleraine.  There\r\nthe Right Hon. Mr. Jackson assisted me with the greatest politeness in\r\nprocuring the intelligence I wished about the salmon fishery, which is\r\nthe greatest in the kingdom, and viewed both fisheries, above and below\r\nthe town, very pleasantly situated on the river Ban.  The salmon spawn in\r\nall the rivers that run into the Ban about the beginning of August, and\r\nas soon as they have done, swim to the sea, where they stay till January,\r\nwhen they begin to return to the fresh water, and continue doing it till\r\nAugust, in which voyage they are taken.  The nets are set in the middle\r\nof January, but by Act of Parliament no nets nor weirs can be kept down\r\nafter the 12th of August.  All the fisheries on the river Ban let at\r\n6,000 pounds a year.  From the sea to the rock above Coleraine, where the\r\nweirs are built, belongs to the London companies; the greatest part of\r\nthe rest to Lord Donegal.  The eel fisheries let at 1,000 pounds a year,\r\nand the salmon fisheries at Coleraine at 1,000 pounds.  The eels make\r\nperiodical voyages, as the salmon, but instead of spawning in the fresh\r\nwater, they go to the sea to spawn, and the young fry return against the\r\nstream; to enable them to do which with greater ease at the leap straw\r\nropes are hung in the water for them.  When they return to sea they are\r\ntaken.  Many of them weigh nine or ten pounds.  The young salmon are\r\ncalled _grawls_, and grow at a rate which I should suppose scarce any\r\nfish commonly known equals; for within the year some of them will come to\r\nsixteen and eighteen pounds, but in general ten or twelve pounds.  Such\r\nas escape the first year's fishery are salmon; and at two years old will\r\ngenerally weigh twenty to twenty-five pounds.  This year's fishery has\r\nproved the greatest that ever was known, and they had the largest haul,\r\ntaking 1,452 salmon at one drag of one net.  In the year 1758 they had\r\n882, which was the next greatest haul.  I had the pleasure of seeing 370\r\ndrawn in at once.  They have this year taken 400 tons of fish; 200 sold\r\nfresh at a penny and three-halfpence a pound, and two hundred salted, at\r\n18 pounds and 20 pounds per ton, which are sent to London, Spain, and\r\nItaly.  The fishery employs eighty men, and the expenses in general are\r\ncalculated to equal the rent.\r\n\r\nThe linen manufacture is very general about Coleraine, coarse ten-hundred\r\nlinen.  It is carried to Dublin in cars, one hundred and ten miles, at\r\n5s. per cwt. in summer, and 7s. 6d. in winter.\r\n\r\nFrom Limavady to Derry there is very little uncultivated land.  Within\r\nfour miles of the latter, rents are from 12s. to 20s.; mountains paid for\r\nbut in the gross.  Reached Derry at night, and waited two hours in the\r\ndark before the ferry-boat came over for me.\r\n\r\nAugust 7.  In the morning went to the bishop's palace to leave my letters\r\nof recommendation; for I was informed of my misfortune in his being out\r\nof the kingdom.  He was upon a voyage to Staffa, and had sent home some\r\nof the stones of which it consists.  They appeared perfectly to resemble\r\nin shape, colour, and smell, those of the Giant's Causeway.\r\n\r\nAugust 8.  Left Derry, and took the road by Raphoe to the Rev. Mr.\r\nGolding's at Clonleigh, who favoured me with much valuable information.\r\nThe view of Derry at the distance of a mile or two is the most\r\npicturesque of any place I have seen.  It seems to be built on an island\r\nof bold land rising from the river, which spreads into a fine basin at\r\nthe foot of the town; the adjacent country hilly.  The scene wants\r\nnothing but wood to make it a perfect landscape.\r\n\r\nAugust 11.  Left Mount Charles, and passing through Donegal took the road\r\nto Ballyshannon; came presently to several beautiful landscapes, swelling\r\nhills cultivated, with the bay flowing up among them.  They want nothing\r\nbut more wood, and are beautiful without it.  Afterwards likewise to the\r\nleft they rise in various outlines, and die away insensibly into one\r\nanother.  When the road leads to a full view of the bay of Donegal, these\r\nsmiling spots, above which the proud mountains rear their heads, are\r\nnumerous, the hillocks of almost regular circular forms.  They are very\r\npleasing from form, verdure, and the water breaking in their vales.\r\n\r\nBefore I got to Ballyshannon, remarked a bleach green, which indicates\r\nweaving in the neighbourhood.  Viewed the salmon-leap at Ballyshannon,\r\nwhich is let for 400 pounds a year.  The scenery of it is very beautiful.\r\nIt is a fine fall, and the coast of the river very bold, consisting of\r\nperpendicular rocks with grass of a beautiful verdure to the very edge.\r\nIt projects in little promontories, which grew longer as they approach\r\nthe sea, and open to give a fine view of the ocean.  Before the fall in\r\nthe middle of the river, is a rocky island on which is a curing house,\r\ninstead of the turret of a ruined castle for which it seems formed.  The\r\ntown prettily situated on the rising ground on each side of the river.\r\nTo Sir James Caldwell's.  Crossing the bridge, stopped for a view of the\r\nriver, which is a very fine one, and was delighted to see the salmon\r\njump, to me an unusual sight; the water was perfectly alive with them.\r\nRising the hill, look back on the town; the situation beautiful, the\r\nriver presents a noble view.  Come to Belleek, a little village with one\r\nof the finest water-falls I remember anywhere to have seen; viewed it\r\nfrom the bridge.  The river in a very broad sheet comes from behind some\r\nwood, and breaks over a bed of rocks, not perpendicular, but shelving in\r\nvarious directions, and foams away under the arches, after which it grows\r\nmore silent and gives a beautiful bend under a rock crowned by a fine\r\nbank of wood.  Reached Castle Caldwell at night, where Sir James Caldwell\r\nreceived me with a politeness and cordiality that will make me long\r\nremember it with pleasure.\r\n\r\nAugust 15.  To Belleisle, the charming seat of the Earl of Ross.  It is\r\nan island in Loch Earne, of two hundred Irish acres, every part of it\r\nhill, dale, and gentle declivities; it has a great deal of wood, much of\r\nwhich is old, and forms both deep shades and open, cheerful groves.  The\r\ntrees hang on the slopes, and consequently show themselves to the best\r\nadvantage.  All this is exceedingly pretty, but it is rendered trebly so\r\nby the situation.  A reach of the lake passes before the house, which is\r\nsituated near the banks among some fine woods, which give both beauty and\r\nshelter.  This sheet of water, which is three miles over, is bounded in\r\nfront by an island of thick wood, and by a bold circular hill which is\r\nhis lordship's deer park; this hill is backed by a considerable mountain.\r\nTo the right are four or five fine clumps of dark wood--so many islands\r\nwhich rise boldly from the lake; the water breaks in straits between\r\nthem, and forms a scene extremely picturesque.  On the other side the\r\nlake stretches behind wood in a strait which forms Belleisle.  Lord Ross\r\nhas made walks round the island, from which there is a considerable\r\nvariety of prospect.  A temple is built on a gentle hill, commanding the\r\nview of the wooded islands above-mentioned, but the most pleasing\r\nprospect of them is coming out from the grotto.  They appear in an\r\nuncommon beauty; two seem to join, and the water which flows between\r\ntakes the appearance of a fine bay, projecting deep into a dark wood:\r\nnothing can be more beautiful.  The park hill rises above them, and the\r\nwhole is backed with mountains.  The home scene at your feet also is\r\npretty; a lawn scattered with trees that forms the margin of the lake,\r\nclosing gradually in a thick wood of tall trees, above the tops of which\r\nis a distant view of Cultiegh mountain, which is there seen in its\r\nproudest solemnity.\r\n\r\nThey plough all with horses three or four in a plough, and all abreast.\r\nHere let it be remarked that they very commonly plough and harrow with\r\ntheir horses drawing by the tail: it is done every season.  Nothing can\r\nput them beside this, and they insist that, take a horse tired in traces\r\nand put him to work by the tail, he will draw better: quite fresh again.\r\nIndignant reader, this is no jest of mine, but cruel, stubborn, barbarous\r\ntruth.  It is so all over Cavan.\r\n\r\nAt Clonells, near Castlerea, lives O'Connor, the direct descendant of\r\nRoderick O'Connor, who was king of Connaught six or seven hundred years\r\nago; there is a monument of him in Roscommon Church, with his sceptre,\r\netc.  I was told as a certainty that this family were here long before\r\nthe coming of the Milesians.  Their possessions, formerly so great, are\r\nreduced to three or four hundred pounds a year, the family having fared\r\nin the revolutions of so many ages much worse than the O'Niels and\r\nO'Briens.  The common people pay him the greatest respect, and send him\r\npresents of cattle, etc., upon various occasions.  They consider him as\r\nthe prince of a people involved in one common ruin.\r\n\r\nAnother great family in Connaught is Macdermot, who calls himself Prince\r\nof Coolavin.  He lives at Coolavin, in Sligo, and though he has not above\r\none hundred pounds a year, will not admit his children to sit down in his\r\npresence.  This was certainly the case with his father, and some assured\r\nme even with the present chief.  Lord Kingsborough, Mr. Ponsonby, Mr.\r\nO'Hara, Mr. Sandford, etc., came to see him, and his address was curious:\r\n\"O'Hara, you are welcome!  Sandford, I am glad to see your mother's son\"\r\n(his mother was an O'Brien): \"as to the rest of ye, come in as ye can.\"\r\nMr. O'Hara, of Nymphsfield, is in possession of a considerable estate in\r\nSligo, which is the remains of great possessions they had in that\r\ncountry.  He is one of the few descendants of the Milesian race.\r\n\r\nTo Lord Kingston's, to whom I had a letter, but unfortunately for me he\r\nwas at Spa.  Walked down to Longford Hill to view the lake.  It is one of\r\nthe most delicious scenes I ever beheld; a lake of five miles by four,\r\nwhich fills the bottom of a gentle valley almost of a circular form,\r\nbounded very boldly by the mountains.  Those to the left rise in a noble\r\nslope; they lower rather in front, and let in a view of Strand mountain,\r\nnear Sligo, above twenty miles off.  To the right you look over a small\r\npart of a bog to a large extent of cultivated hill, with the blue\r\nmountains beyond.  Were this little piece of bog planted, the view would\r\nbe more complete; the hill on which you stand has a foliage of well-grown\r\ntrees, which form the southern shore.  You look down on six islands, all\r\nwooded, and on a fine promontory to the left, which shoots far into the\r\nlake.  Nothing can be more pleasing than their uncommon variety.  The\r\nfirst is small (Rock Island), tufted with trees, under the shade of which\r\nis an ancient building, once the residence of Macdermot.  The next a\r\nmixture of lawn and wood.  The third, which appears to join this, is of a\r\ndarker shade, yet not so thick but you can see the bright lawn under the\r\ntrees.  House Island is one fine, thick wood, which admits not a gleam of\r\nlight, a contrast to the silver bosom of the lake.  Church Island is at a\r\ngreater distance; this is also a clump, and rises boldly.  Rock Island is\r\nof wood; it opens in the centre and shows a lawn with a building on it.\r\nIt is impossible to imagine a more pleasing and cheerful scene.  Passed\r\nthe chapel to Smithfield Hill, which is a fine rising ground, quite\r\nsurrounded with plantations.  From hence the view is changed; here the\r\npromontory appears very bold, and over its neck you see another wooded\r\nisland in a most picturesque situation.  Nothing can be more picturesque\r\nthan Rock Island, its ruin overhung with ivy.  The other islands assume\r\nfresh and varied outlines, and form upon the whole one of the most\r\nluxuriant scenes I have met with.\r\n\r\nThe views of the lake and environs are very fine as you go to Boyle; the\r\nwoods unite into a large mass, and contrast the bright sheet of water\r\nwith their dark shades.\r\n\r\nThe lands about Kingston are very fine, a rich, dry, yellow, sandy loam,\r\nthe finest soil that I have seen in Ireland; all grass, and covered with\r\nvery fine bullocks, cows, and sheep.  The farms rise to five hundred\r\nacres, and are generally in divisions, parted by stone walls, for oxen,\r\ncows, young cattle, and sheep separate.  Some of the lands will carry an\r\nox and a wether per acre; rents, 15s. to 20s.\r\n\r\nDined at Boyle, and took the road to Ballymoat.  Crossed an immense\r\nmountainy bog, where I stopped and made inquiries; found that it was ten\r\nmiles long, and three and a half over, containing thirty-five square\r\nmiles; that limestone quarries were around and in it, and limestone\r\ngravel in many places to be found, and used in the lands that join it.\r\nIn addition to this I may add that there is a great road crossing it.\r\nThirty-five miles are twenty-two thousand four hundred acres.  What an\r\nimmense field of improvement!  Nothing would be easier than to drain it\r\n(vast tracts of land have such a fall), that not a drop of water could\r\nremain.  These hilly bogs are extremely different from any I have seen in\r\nEngland.  In the moors in the north the hills and mountains are all\r\ncovered with heath, like the Irish bogs, but they are of various soils,\r\ngravel, shingle, moor, etc., and boggy only in spots, but the Irish bog\r\nhills are all pure bog to a great depth without the least variation of\r\nsoil; and the bog being of a hilly form, is a proof that it is a growing\r\nvegetable mass, and not owing merely to stagnant water.  Sir Laurence\r\nDundass is the principal proprietor of this.\r\n\r\nReached Ballymoat in the evening, the residence of the Hon. Mr.\r\nFitzmaurice, where I expected great pleasure in viewing a manufactory, of\r\nwhich I heard much since I came to Ireland.  He was so kind as to give me\r\nthe following account of it in the most liberal manner:--\r\n\r\n\"Twenty years ago the late Lord Shelburne came to Ballymoat, a wild\r\nuncultivated region without industry or civility, and the people all\r\nRoman Catholics, without an atom of a manufacture, not even spinning.  In\r\norder to change this state of things, his lordship contracted with people\r\nin the north to bring Protestant weavers and establish a manufactory, as\r\nthe only means of making the change he wished.  This was done, but\r\nfalling into the hands of rascals he lost 5,000 pounds by the business,\r\nwith only seventeen Protestant families and twenty-six or twenty-seven\r\nlooms established for it.  Upon his death Lady Shelburne wished to carry\r\nhis scheme into execution, and to do it gave much encouragement to Mr.\r\nWakefield, the great Irish factor in London, by granting advantageous\r\nleases under the contract of building and colonising by weavers from the\r\nnorth, and carrying on the manufactory.  He found about twenty looms\r\nworking upon their own account, and made a considerable progress in this\r\nfor five years, raising several buildings, cottages for the weavers, and\r\nwas going on as well as the variety of his business would admit,\r\nemploying sixty looms.  He then died, when a stand was made to all the\r\nworks for a year, in which everything went much to ruin.  Lady Shelburne\r\nthen employed a new manager to carry on the manufacture upon his own\r\naccount, giving him very profitable grants of lands to encourage him to\r\ndo it with spirit.  He continued for five years, employing sixty looms\r\nalso, but his circumstances failing, a fresh stop was put to the work.\r\n\r\n\"Then it was that Mr. Fitzmaurice, in the year 1774, determined to exert\r\nhimself in pushing on a manufactory which promised to be of such\r\nessential service to the whole country.  To do this with effect, he saw\r\nthat it was necessary to take it entirely into his own hands.  He could\r\nlend money to the manager to enable him to go on, but that would be at\r\nbest hazardous, and could never do it in the complete manner in which he\r\nwished to establish it.  In this period of consideration, Mr. Fitzmaurice\r\nwas advised by his friends never to engage in so complex a business as a\r\nmanufacture, in which he must of necessity become a merchant, also engage\r\nin all the hazard, irksomeness, etc., of commerce, so totally different\r\nfrom his birth, education, ideas, and pursuits; but tired with the\r\ninactivity of common life, he determined not only to turn manufacturer,\r\nbut to carry on the business in the most spirited and vigorous manner\r\nthat was possible.  In the first place he took every means of making\r\nhimself a complete master of the business; he went through various\r\nmanufactures, inquired into the minutiae, and took every measure to know\r\nit to the bottom.  This he did so repeatedly and with such attention in\r\nthe whole progress, from spinning to bleaching and selling, that he\r\nbecame as thorough a master of it as an experienced manager; he has wove\r\nlinen, and done every part of the business with his own hands.  As he\r\ndetermined to have the works complete, he took Mr. Stansfield the\r\nengineer, so well known for his improved saw-mills, into his pay.  He\r\nsent him over to Ballymoat in the winter of 1774, in order to erect the\r\nmachinery of a bleach mill upon the very best construction; he went to\r\nall the great mills in the north of Ireland to inspect them, to remark\r\ntheir deficiencies, that they might be improved in the mills he intended\r\nto erect.  This knowledge being gained, the work was begun, and as water\r\nwas necessary, a great basin was formed by a dam across a valley, by\r\nwhich means thirty-four acres were floated, to serve as a reservoir for\r\ndry seasons, to secure plenty at all times.\"\r\n\r\nAugust 30.  Rode to Rosshill, four miles off, a headland that projects\r\ninto the Bay of Newport, from which there is a most beautiful view of the\r\nbay on both sides; I counted thirty islands very distinctly, all of them\r\ncultivated under corn and potatoes, or pastured by cattle.  At a distance\r\nClare rises in a very bold and picturesque style; on the left Crow\r\nPatrick, and to the right other mountains.  It is a view that wants\r\nnothing but wood.\r\n\r\nSeptember 5.  To Drumoland, the seat of Sir Lucius O'Brien, in the county\r\nof Clare, a gentleman who had been repeatedly assiduous to procure me\r\nevery sort of information.  I should remark, as I have now left Galway,\r\nthat that county, from entering it in the road to Tuam till leaving it\r\nto-day, has been, upon the whole, inferior to most of the parts I have\r\ntravelled in Ireland in point of beauty: there are not mountains of a\r\nmagnitude to make the view striking.  It is perfectly free from woods,\r\nand even trees, except about gentlemen's houses, nor has it a variety in\r\nits face.  I do not, however, speak without exception; I passed some\r\ntracts which are cheerful.  Drumoland has a pleasing variety of grounds\r\nabout the house; it stands on a hill gently rising from a lake of\r\ntwenty-four acres, in the middle of a noble wood of oak, ash, poplar,\r\netc.; three beautiful hills rise above, over which the plantations spread\r\nin a varied manner; and these hills command very fine views of the great\r\nrivers Fergus and Shannon at their junction, being each of them a league\r\nwide.\r\n\r\nThere is a view of the Shannon from Limerick to Foynes Island, which is\r\nthirty miles, with all its bays, bends, islands, and fertile shores.  It\r\nis from one to three miles broad, a most noble river, deserving regal\r\nnavies for its ornament, or, what are better, fleets of merchantmen, the\r\ncheerful signs of far-extended commerce, instead of a few miserable\r\nfishing-boats, the only canvas that swelled upon the scene; but the want\r\nof commerce in her ports is the misfortune not the fault of\r\nIreland--thanks for the deficiency to that illiberal spirit of trading\r\njealousy, which has at times actuated and disgraced so many nations.  The\r\nprospect has a noble outline in the bold mountains of Tipperary, Cork,\r\nLimerick, and Kerry.  The whole view magnificent.\r\n\r\nAt the foot of this hill is the castle of Bunratty, a very large edifice,\r\nthe seat of the O'Briens, princes of Thomond; it stands on the bank of a\r\nriver, which falls into the Shannon near it.  About this castle and that\r\nof Rosmanagher the land is the best in the county of Clare; it is worth 1\r\npound 13s. an acre, and fats a bullock per acre in summer, besides winter\r\nfeed.\r\n\r\nTo Limerick, through a cheerful country, on the banks of the river, in a\r\nvale surrounded by distant mountains.  That city is very finely situated,\r\npartly on an island formed by the Shannon.  The new part, called Newtown\r\nPery, from Mr. Pery the speaker, who owns a considerable part of the\r\ncity, and represents it in Parliament, is well built.  The houses are new\r\nones, of brick, large, and in right lines.  There is a communication with\r\nthe rest of the town by a handsome bridge of three large arches erected\r\nat Mr. Pery's expense.  Here are docks, quays, and a custom-house, which\r\nis a good building, faces the river, and on the opposite banks is a large\r\nquadrangular one, the house of industry.  This part of Limerick is very\r\ncheerful and agreeable, and carries all the marks of a flourishing place.\r\n\r\nThe exports of this port are beef, pork, butter, hides, and rape-seed.\r\nThe imports are rum, sugar, timber, tobacco, wines, coals, bark, salt,\r\netc.  The customs and excise, about sixteen years ago, amounted to 16,000\r\npounds, at present 32,000 pounds, and rather more four or five years ago.\r\n\r\nWhole revenue           1751                    16,000 pounds\r\n\"      \"                1775                    51,000 pounds\r\n\r\n             _Revenue of the Port of Limerick.

Rents were at the highest in 1765;\r\nfell since, but in four years have fallen 8s. to 10s. an acre about\r\nLimerick.  They are at a stand at present, owing to the high price of\r\nprovisions from pasture.  The number of people in Limerick is computed at\r\nthirty-two thousand; it is exceedingly populous for the size, the chief\r\nstreet quite crowded; many sedan chairs in town, and some hackney\r\nchaises.  Assemblies the year round, in a new assembly-house built for\r\nthe purpose, and plays and concerts common.\r\n\r\nUpon the whole, Limerick must be a very gay place, but when the usual\r\nnumber of troops are in town much more so.  To show the general expenses\r\nof living, I was told of a person's keeping a carriage, four horses,\r\nthree men, three maids, a good table, a wife, three children, and a\r\nnurse, and all for 500 pounds a year:\r\n\r\n                        l.   s.  d.             l.   s.  d.\r\nA footman               4   4   0 to            6   6   0\r\nA professed                                     6   6   0\r\nwoman-cook\r\nA house-maid                                    3   0   0\r\nA kitchen-maid                                  2   0   0\r\nA butler                10   0   0 to           12   0   0\r\n\r\nA barrel of beef or pork, 200lb. weight.  Vessels of 400 tons can come up\r\nwith spring tides, which rise fourteen feet.\r\n\r\nSeptember 9.  To Castle Oliver; various country, not so rich to\r\nappearance as the Caucasus, being fed bare; much hilly sheep walk, and\r\nfor a considerable way a full third of it potatoes and corn: no sign of\r\ndepopulation.  Just before I got to the hills a field of ragwort\r\n(_senesio jacoboea_) buried the cows.  The first hill of Castle Oliver\r\ninteresting.  After rising a mountain so high that no one could think of\r\nany house, you come in view of a vale, quite filled with fine woods,\r\nfields margined with trees, and hedge plantations climbing up the\r\nmountains.  Having engaged myself to Mr. Oliver, to return from Killarney\r\nby his house, as he was confined to Limerick by the assizes, I shall omit\r\nsaying anything of it at present.\r\n\r\nSeptember 16.  To Cove by water, from Mr. Trent's quay.  The view of Lota\r\nis charming; a fine rising lawn from the water, with noble spreading\r\nwoods reaching on each side; the house a very pleasing front, with lawn\r\nshooting into the woods.  The river forms a creek between two hills, one\r\nLota, the other opening to another hill of inclosures well wooded.  As\r\nthe boat leaves the shore nothing can be finer than the view behind us;\r\nthe back woods of Lota, the house and lawn, and the high bold inclosures\r\ntowards Cork, form the finest shore imaginable, leading to Cork, the city\r\nappearing in full view, Dunkettle wooded inclosures, a fine sweep of\r\nhill, joining Mr. Hoare's at Factory Hill, whose woods have a beautiful\r\neffect.  Dunkettle House almost lost in a wood.  As we advance, the woods\r\nof Lota and Dunkettle unite in one fine mass.  The sheet of water, the\r\nrising lawns, the house in the most beautiful situation imaginable, with\r\nmore woods above it than lawns below it, the west shore of Loch Mahon, a\r\nvery fine rising hill cut into inclosures but without wood, land-locked\r\non every side with high lands, scattered with inclosures, woods, seats,\r\netc., with every cheerful circumstance of lively commerce, have\r\naltogether a great effect.  Advancing to Passage the shores are various,\r\nand the scenery enlivened by fourscore sail of large ships; the little\r\nport of Passage at the water's edge, with the hills rising boldly above\r\nit.  The channel narrows between the great island and the hills of\r\nPassage.  The shores bold, and the ships scattered about them, with the\r\ninclosures hanging behind the masts and yards picturesque.  Passing the\r\nstraits a new basin of the harbour opens, surrounded with high lands.\r\nMonkstown Castle on the hill to the right, and the grounds of\r\nBallybricken, a beautiful intermixed scene of wood and lawn.  The high\r\nshore of the harbour's mouth opens gradually.  The whole scene is\r\nland-locked.  The first view of Haulbowline Island and Spike Island, high\r\nrocky lands, with the channel opening to Cove, where are a fleet of ships\r\nat anchor, and Rostellan, Lord Inchiquin's house, backed with hills, a\r\nscenery that wants nothing but the accompaniment of wood.  The view of\r\nBallybricken changes; it now appears to be unfortunately cut into right\r\nlines.  Arrived at the ship at Cove; in the evening returned, leaving Mr.\r\nJefferys and family on board for a voyage to Havre, in their way to\r\nParis.\r\n\r\nDunkettle is one of the most beautiful places I have seen in Ireland.  It\r\nis a hill of some hundred acres broken into a great variety of ground by\r\ngentle declivities, with everywhere an undulating outline and the whole\r\nvaried by a considerable quantity of wood, which in some places is thick\r\nenough to take the appearance of close groves, in others spreads into\r\nscattered thickets and a variety of single groups.  This hill, or rather\r\ncluster of hills, is surrounded on one side by a reach of Cork Harbour,\r\nover which it looks in the most advantageous manner; and on the other by\r\nan irriguous vale, through which flows the river Glanmire; the opposite\r\nshore of that river has every variety that can unite to form pleasing\r\nlandscapes for the views from Dunkettle grounds; in some places narrow\r\nglens, the bottoms of which are quite filled with water, and the steep\r\nbanks covered with thick woods that spread a deep shade; in others the\r\nvale opens to form the site of a pretty cheerful village, overhung by\r\nhill and wood: here the shore rises gradually into large inclosures,\r\nwhich spread over the hills, stretching beyond each other; and there the\r\nvale melts again into a milder variety of fields.  A hill thus situated,\r\nand consisting in itself of so much variety of surface, must necessarily\r\ncommand many pleasing views.  To enjoy these to the better advantage, Mr.\r\nTrent (than whom no one has a better taste, both to discover and describe\r\nthe beauties of natural scenes) is making a walk around the whole, which\r\nis to bend to the inequalities of the ground, so as to take the principal\r\npoints in view.  The whole is so beautiful, that if I were to make the\r\nregular detour, the description might be too minute; but there are some\r\npoints which gave me so much pleasure that I know not how to avoid\r\nrecommending to others that travel this way to taste the same\r\nsatisfaction.  From the upper part of the orchard you look down a part of\r\nthe river, where it opens into a regular basin, one corner stretching up\r\nto Cork, lost behind the hill of Lota, the lawn of which breaks on the\r\nswelling hills among the woods; the house obscured, and therefore seeming\r\na part of your home scene; the losing the river behind the beautiful\r\nprojection of Lota is more pleasing than can be expressed.  The other\r\nreach, leading to the harbour's mouth, is half hidden by the trees, which\r\nmargin the foot of the hill on which you stand; in front a noble range of\r\ncultivated hills, the inclosures broken by slight spots of wood, and\r\nprettily varied with houses, without being so crowded as to take off the\r\nrural effect.  The scene is not only beautiful in those common\r\ncircumstances which form a landscape, but is alive with the cheerfulness\r\nof ships and boats perpetually moving.  Upon the whole, it is one of the\r\nmost luxuriant prospects I have anywhere seen.  Leaving the orchard, pass\r\non the brow of a hill which forms the bank of the river of Glanmire,\r\ncommanding the opposite woods of Lota in all their beauty.  Rise to the\r\ntop of the high hill which joins the deer park, and exhibits a scene\r\nequally extensive and beautiful; you look down on a vale which winds\r\nalmost around at your feet, finishing to the left in Cork river, which\r\nhere takes the appearance of a lake, bounded by wood and hills, and sunk\r\nin the bottom of a vale, in a style which painting cannot imitate; the\r\nopposite hills of Lota, wood, and lawn, seem formed as objects for this\r\npoint of view: at your feet a hill rises out of the vale, with higher\r\nones around it, the margins scattered wood; to the right, towards\r\nRiverstown, a vale; the whole backed by cultivated hills to Kallahan's\r\nfield.  Milder scenes follow: a bird's-eye view of a small vale sunk at\r\nyour feet, through which the river flows; a bridge of several arches\r\nunites two parts of a beautiful village, the meadow grounds of which rise\r\ngently, a varied surface of wood and lawn, to the hills of Riverstown,\r\nthe whole surrounded by delicious sweeps of cultivated hills.  To the\r\nleft a wooded glen rising from the vale to the horizon, the scenery\r\nsequestered, but pleasing; the oak wood which hangs on the deer-park\r\nhills, an addition.  Down to the brow of the hill, where it hangs over\r\nthe river, a picturesque interesting spot.  The inclosures of the\r\nopposite bank hang beautifully to the eye, and the wooded glen winds up\r\nthe hill.  Returning to the house I was conducted to the hill, where the\r\ngrounds slope off to the river of Cork, which opens to view in noble\r\nreaches of a magnitude that fills the eye and the imagination; a whole\r\ncountry of a character truly magnificent, and behind the winding vale\r\nwhich leads between a series of hills to Glanmire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPictures at Dunkettle.\r\n\r\n\r\nA St. Michael, etc., the subject confused, by Michael Angelo.

A portrait of Sir Patrick Trent, by Sir P. Lely.  An\r\nexcellent portrait of a person unknown, by Dahl.\r\n\r\nSeptember 17.  To Castlemartyr, the seat of the Earl of Shannon, one of\r\nthe most distinguished improvers in Ireland; in whom I found the most\r\nearnest desire to give me every species of information, with a knowledge\r\nand ability which enabled him to do it most effectually.  Passed through\r\nMiddleton, a well-built place, which belongs to the noble lord to whom it\r\ngives title.  Castlemartyr is an old house, but much added to by the\r\npresent earl; he has built, besides other rooms, a dining one thirty-two\r\nfeet long by twenty-two broad, and a drawing one, the best rooms I have\r\nseen in Ireland, a double cube of twenty-five feet, being fifty long,\r\ntwenty-five broad, and twenty-five high.  The grounds about the house are\r\nvery well laid out; much wood well grown, considerable lawns, a river\r\nmade to wind through them in a beautiful manner, an old castle so\r\nperfectly covered with ivy as to be a picturesque object.  A winding walk\r\nleads for a considerable distance along the banks of this river, and\r\npresents several pleasing landscapes.\r\n\r\nFrom Rostellan to Lota, the seat of Frederick Rogers, Esq.  I had before\r\nseen it in the highest perfection from the water going from Dunkettle to\r\nCove, and from the grounds of Dunkettle.  Mrs. Rogers was so obliging as\r\nto show me the back grounds, which are admirably wooded, and of a fine\r\nvaried surface.\r\n\r\nGot to Cork in the evening, and waited on the Dean, who received me with\r\nthe most flattering attention.  Cork is one of the most populous places I\r\nhave ever been in; it was market-day, and I could scarce drive through\r\nthe streets, they were so amazingly thronged: on the other days the\r\nnumber is very great.  I should suppose it must resemble a Dutch town,\r\nfor there are many canals in the streets, with quays before the houses.\r\nThe best built part is Morrison's Island, which promises well; the old\r\npart of the town is very close and dirty.  As to its commerce, the\r\nfollowing particulars I owe to Robert Gordon, Esq., the surveyor-general:\r\n\r\n       _Average of Nineteen Years' Export, ending March_ 24, 1773.\r\n\r\nHides, at 1 pounds each                 64,000 pounds\r\nBay and woollen yarn                    294,000\r\nButter, at 30s. per cwt. from 56s. to   180,000\r\n72s.\r\nBeef, at 20s. a barrel                  291,970\r\nCamlets, serges, etc.                   40,000\r\nCandles                                 34,220\r\nSoap                                    20,000\r\nTallow                                  20,000\r\nHerrings, 18 to 35,000l. all their      21,000\r\nown\r\nGlue 20 to 25,000                       22,000\r\nPork                                    64,000\r\nWool to England                         14,000\r\nSmall exports, Gottenburg herrings,     35,000\r\nhorns, hoofs, etc., feather-beds,\r\npalliasses, feathers, etc.\r\n                                        1,100,190\r\n\r\nAverage prices of the nineteen years on the custom books.  All exports on\r\nthose books are rated at the value of the reign of Charles II.; but the\r\nimports have always 10 per cent. on the sworn price added to them.\r\nSeventy to eighty sail of ships belong to Cork.  Average of ships that\r\nentered that port in those nineteen years, eight hundred and seventy-two\r\nper annum.  The number of people at Cork mustered by the clergy by\r\nhearth-money, and by the number of houses, payments to minister, average\r\nof the three, sixty-seven thousand souls, if taken before the 1st of\r\nSeptember, after that twenty thousand increased.  There are seven hundred\r\ncoopers in the town.  Barrels all of oak or beech, all from America: the\r\nlatter for herrings, now from Gottenburg and Norway.  The excise of Cork\r\nnow no more than in Charles the Second's reign.  Ridiculous!\r\n\r\nCork old duties, in 1751,           62,000 pounds\r\nproduced\r\nNow the same                        140,000\r\n\r\nBullocks, 16,000 head, 32,000 barrels; 41,000 hogs, 20,000 barrels.\r\nButter, 22,000 firkins of half a hundredweight each, both increase this\r\nyear, the whole being\r\n\r\n240,000 firkins of butter,\r\n   120,000 barrels of beef.\r\n\r\nExport of woollen yarn from Cork, 300,000 pounds a year in the Irish\r\nmarket.  No wool smuggled, or at least very little.  The wool comes to\r\nCork, etc., and is delivered out to combers, who make it into balls.\r\nThese balls are bought up by the French agents at a vast price, and\r\nexported; but even this does not amount to 40,000 pounds a year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPrices.\r\n\r\n\r\nBeef, 21s. per cwt., never so high by 2s. 6d.; pork, 30s., never higher\r\nthan 18s. 6d., owing to the army demand.  Slaughter dung, 8d. for a horse\r\nload.  Country labourer, 6d.; about town, 10d.  Milk, seven pints a\r\npenny.  Coals, 3s. 8d. to 5s. a barrel, six of which make a ton.  Eggs,\r\nfour a penny.\r\n\r\nCork labourers.  Cellar ones, twenty thousand; have 1s. 1d. a day, and as\r\nmuch bread, beef, and beer as they can eat and drink, and seven pounds of\r\noffals a week for their families.  Rent for their house, 40s.  Masons'\r\nand carpenters' labourers, 10d. a day.  Sailors now 3 pounds a month and\r\nprovisions: before the American war, 28s.  Porters and coal-heavers paid\r\nby the great.  State of the poor people in general incomparably better\r\noff than they were twenty years ago.  There are imported eighteen\r\nthousand barrels annually of Scotch herrings, at 18s. a barrel.  The salt\r\nfor the beef trade comes from Lisbon, St. Ube's, etc.  The salt for the\r\nfish trade from Rochelle.  For butter English and Irish.\r\n\r\nParticulars of the woollen fabrics of the county of Cork received from a\r\nmanufacturer.  The woollen trade, serges and camlets, ratteens, friezes,\r\ndruggets, and narrow cloths, the last they make to 10s. and 12s. a yard;\r\nif they might export to 8s. they are very clear that they could get a\r\ngreat trade for the woollen manufactures of Cork.  The wool comes from\r\nGalway and Roscommon, combed here by combers, who earn 8s. to 10s. a\r\nweek, into balls of twenty-four ounces, which is spun into worsteds of\r\ntwelve skeins to the ball, and exported to Yarmouth for Norwich; the\r\nexport price, 30 pounds a pack to 33 pounds, never before so high;\r\naverage of them, 26 pounds to 30 pounds.  Some they work up at home into\r\nserges, stuffs, and camlets; the serges at 12d. a yard, thirty-four\r\ninches wide; the stuffs sixteen inches, at 18d., the camlets at 9.5d. to\r\n13d.; the spinners at 9d. a ball, one in a week; or a ball and half 12d.\r\na week, and attend the family besides; this is done most in Waterford and\r\nKerry, particularly near Killarney; the weavers earn 1s. a day on an\r\naverage.  Full three-fourths of the wool is exported in yarn, and only\r\none-fourth worth worked up.  Half the wool of Ireland is combed in the\r\ncounty of Cork.\r\n\r\nA very great manufacture of ratteens at Carrick-on-Suir; the bay worsted\r\nis for serges, shalloons, etc.  Woollen yarn for coarse cloths, which\r\nlatter have been lost for some years, owing to the high price of wool.\r\nThe bay export has declined since 1770, which declension is owing to the\r\nhigh price of wool.\r\n\r\nNo wool smuggled, not even from Kerry; not a sloop's cargo in twenty\r\nyears, the price too high; the declension has been considerable.  For\r\nevery eighty-six packs that are exported, a licence from the Lord\r\nLieutenant, for which 20 pounds is paid.\r\n\r\nFrom the Act of the last sessions of Great Britain for exporting woollen\r\ngoods for the troops in the pay of Ireland, Mr. Abraham Lane, of Cork,\r\nestablished a new manufacture of army clothing for that purpose, which is\r\nthe first at Cork, and pays 40 pounds a week in labour only.  Upon the\r\nwhole there has been no increase of woollen manufacture within twenty\r\nyears.  Is clearly of opinion that many fabrics might be worked up here\r\nmuch cheaper than in France, of cloths that the French have beat the\r\nEnglish out of; these are, particularly, broadcloths of one yard and half\r\nyard wide, from 3s. to 6s. 6d. a yard for the Levant trade.  Friezes\r\nwhich are now supplied from Carcassone in Languedoc.  Friezes, of\r\ntwenty-four to twenty-seven inches, at 10d. to 13d. a yard.  Flannels,\r\ntwenty-seven to thirty-six, from 7d. to 14d.  Serges of twenty-seven to\r\nthirty-six inches, at 7d. to 12d. a yard; these would work up the coarse\r\nwool.  At Ballynasloe Fair, in July, 200,000 pounds a year bought in\r\nwool.  There is a manufactory of knit-stocking by the common women about\r\nCork, for eight or ten miles around; the yarn from 12d. to 18d. a pair,\r\nand the worsted from 16d. to 20d., and earn from 12d. to 18d. a week.\r\nBesides their own consumption, great quantities are sent to the north of\r\nIreland.\r\n\r\nAll the weavers in the country are confined to towns, have no land, but\r\nsmall gardens.  Bandle, or narrow linen, for home consumption, is made in\r\nthe western part of the county.  Generally speaking, the circumstances of\r\nall the manufacturing poor are better than they were twenty years ago.\r\nThe manufactures have not declined, though the exportation has, owing to\r\nthe increased home consumptions.  Bandon was once the seat of the stuff,\r\ncamlet, and shag manufacture, but has in seven years declined above\r\nthree-fourths.  Have changed it for the manufacture of coarse green\r\nlinens, for the London market, from 6d. to 9d. a yard, twenty-seven\r\ninches wide; but the number of manufactures in general much lessened.\r\n\r\nRode to the mouth of Cork Harbour; the grounds about it are all fine,\r\nbold, and varied, but so bare of trees, that there is not a single view\r\nbut what pains one in the want of wood.  Rents of the tract south of the\r\nriver Caragoline, from 5s. to 30s.; average, 10s.  Not one man in five\r\nhas a cow, but generally from one to four acres, upon which they have\r\npotatoes, and five or six sheep, which they milk, and spin their wool.\r\nLabour 5d. in winter, 6d. in summer; many of them for three months in the\r\nyear live on potatoes and water, the rest of it they have a good deal of\r\nfish.  But it is remarked, at Kinsale, that when sprats are most\r\nplentiful, diseases are most common.  Rent for a mere cabin, 10s.  Much\r\nparing and burning; paring twenty-eight men a day, sow wheat on it and\r\nthen potatoes; get great crops.  The soil a sharp, stony land; no\r\nlimestone south of the above river.  Manure for potatoes, with sea-weed,\r\nfor 26s., which gives good crops, but lasts only one year.  Sea-sand much\r\nused; no shells in it.  Farms rise to two or three hundred acres, but are\r\nhired in partnership.\r\n\r\nBefore I quit the environs of Cork, I must remark that the country on the\r\nharbour I think preferable, in many respects, for a residence, to\r\nanything I have seen in Ireland.  First, it is the most southerly part of\r\nthe kingdom.  Second, there are very great beauties of prospect.  Third,\r\nby much the most animated, busy scene of shipping in all Ireland, and\r\nconsequently, fourth, a ready price for every product.  Fifth, great\r\nplenty of excellent fish and wild fowl.  Sixth, the neighbourhood of a\r\ngreat city for objects of convenience.\r\n\r\nSeptember 25.  Took the road to Nedeen, through the wildest region of\r\nmountains that I remember to have seen; it is a dreary but an interesting\r\nroad.  The various horrid, grotesque, and unusual forms in which the\r\nmountains rise and the rocks bulge; the immense height of some distant\r\nheads, which rear above all the nearer scenes, the torrents roaring in\r\nthe vales, and breaking down the mountain sides, with here and there a\r\nwretched cabin, and a spot of culture yielding surprise to find human\r\nbeings the inhabitants of such a scene of wildness, altogether keep the\r\ntraveller's mind in an agitation and suspense.  These rocks and mountains\r\nare many of them no otherwise improvable than by planting, for which,\r\nhowever, they are exceedingly well adapted.\r\n\r\nSir John Colthurst was so obliging as to send half a dozen labourers with\r\nme, to help my chaise up a mountain side, of which he gave a formidable\r\naccount: in truth it deserved it.  The road leads directly against a\r\nmountain ridge, and those who made it were so incredibly stupid, that\r\nthey kept the straight line up the hill, instead of turning aside to the\r\nright to wind around a projection of it.  The path of the road is worn by\r\ntorrents into a channel, which is blocked up in places by huge fragments,\r\nso that it would be a horrid road on a level; but on a hill so steep,\r\nthat the best path would be difficult to ascend--it may be supposed\r\nterrible: the labourers, two passing strangers, and my servant, could\r\nwith difficulty get the chaise up.  It is much to be regretted that the\r\ndirection of the road is not changed, as all the rest from Cork to Nedeen\r\nis good enough.  For a few miles towards the latter place the country is\r\nflat on the river Kenmare, much of it good, and under grass or corn.\r\nPassed Mr. Orpine's at Ardtilly, and another of the same name at\r\nKillowen.\r\n\r\nNedeen is a little town, very well situated, on the noble river Kenmare,\r\nwhere ships of one hundred and fifty tons may come up; there are but\r\nthree or four good houses.  Lord Shelburne, to whom the place belongs,\r\nhas built one for his agent.  There is a vale of good land, which is here\r\nfrom a mile and a half to a mile broad; and to the north and south, great\r\nridges of mountains said to be full of mines.\r\n\r\nAt Nedeen, Lord Shelburne had taken care to have me well informed by his\r\npeople in that country, which belongs for the greatest part to himself,\r\nhe has above one hundred and fifty thousand Irish acres in Kerry; the\r\ngreatest part of the barony of Glanrought belongs to him, most of\r\nDunkerron and Ivragh.  The country is all a region of mountains, inclosed\r\nby a vale of flat land on the river; the mountains to the south come to\r\nthe water's edge, with but few variations, the principal of which is\r\nArdee, a farm of Lord Shelburne's to the north of the river, the flat\r\nland is one-half to three-quarters of a mile broad.  The mountains to the\r\nsouth reach to Bear-haven, and those to the north to Dingle Bay; the soil\r\nis extremely various; to the south of the river all are sandstones, and\r\nthe hills loam, stone, gravel, and bog.  To the north there is a slip of\r\nlimestone land, from Kilgarvon to Cabbina-cush, that is six miles east of\r\nNedeen, and three to the west, but is not more than a quarter of a mile\r\nbroad, the rest, including the mountains, all sandstone.  As to its\r\nrents, it is very difficult to tell what they are; for land is let by the\r\nplough-land and gineve, twelve gineves to the plough-land; but the latter\r\ndenomination is not of any particular quantity, for no two plough-lands\r\nare the same.  The size of farms is various, from forty acres to one\r\nthousand; less quantities go with cabins, and some farms are taken by\r\nlabourers in partnership.\r\n\r\nSoon entered the wildest and most romantic country I had anywhere seen; a\r\nregion of steep rocks and mountains which continued for nine or ten\r\nmiles, till I came in view of Mucruss.  There is something magnificently\r\nwild in this stupendous scenery, formed to impress the mind with a\r\ncertain species of terror.  All this tract has a rude and savage air, but\r\nparts of it are strikingly interesting; the mountains are bare and rocky,\r\nand of a great magnitude; the vales are rocky glens, where a mountain\r\nstream tumbles along the roughest bed imaginable, and receives many\r\ntorrents, pouring from clefts, half overhung with shrubby wood; some of\r\nthese streams are seen, and the roar of others heard, but hid by vast\r\nmasses of rock.  Immense fragments, torn from the precipices by storms\r\nand torrents, are tumbled in the wildest confusion, and seem to hang\r\nrather than rest upon projecting precipices.  Upon some of these\r\nfragments of rock, perfectly detached from the soil, except by the side\r\non which they lie, are beds of black turf, with luxuriant crops of heath,\r\netc., which appeared very curious to me, having nowhere seen the like;\r\nand I observed very high in the mountains--much higher than any\r\ncultivation is at present, on the right hand--flat and cleared spaces of\r\ngood grass among the ridges of rock, which had probably been cultivated,\r\nand proved that these mountains were not incapable from climate of being\r\napplied to useful purposes.\r\n\r\nFrom one of these heights I looked forward to the Lake of Killarney at a\r\nconsiderable distance, and backward to the river Kenmare; came in view of\r\na small part of the upper lake, spotted with several islands, and\r\nsurrounded by the most tremendous mountains that can be imagined, of an\r\naspect savage and dreadful.  From this scene of wild magnificence, I\r\nbroke at once upon all the glories of Killarney; from an elevated point\r\nof view I looked down on a considerable part of the lake, which gave me a\r\nspecimen of what I might expect.  The water you command (which, however,\r\nis only a part of the lake) appears a basin of two or three miles round;\r\nto the left it is inclosed by the mountains you have passed, particularly\r\nby the Turk, whose outline is uncommonly noble, and joins a range of\r\nothers, that form the most magnificent shore in the world: on the other\r\nside is a rising scenery of cultivated hills, and Lord Kenmare's park and\r\nwoods; the end of the lake at your feet is formed by the root of\r\nMangerton, on whose side the road leads.  From hence I looked down on a\r\npretty range of inclosures on the lake, and the woods and lawns of\r\nMucruss, forming a large promontory of thick wood, shooting far into the\r\nlake.  The most active fancy can sketch nothing in addition.  Islands of\r\nwood beyond seem to join it, and reaches of the lake, breaking partly\r\nbetween, give the most lively intermixture of water; six or seven isles\r\nand islets form an accompaniment: some are rocky, but with a slight\r\nvegetation, others contain groups of trees, and the whole thrown into\r\nforms, which would furnish new ideas to a painter.  Farther is a chain of\r\nwooded islands, which also appear to join the mainland, with an offspring\r\nof lesser ones scattered around.\r\n\r\nArrived at Mr. Herbert's at Mucruss, to whose friendly attention I owed\r\nmy succeeding pleasure.  There have been so many descriptions of\r\nKillarney written by gentlemen who have resided some time there, and seen\r\nit at every season, that for a passing traveller to attempt the like\r\nwould be in vain; for this reason I shall give the mere journal of the\r\nremarks I made on the spot, in the order I viewed the lake.\r\n\r\nSeptember 27.  Walked into Mr. Herbert's beautiful grounds, to Oroch's\r\nHill, in the lawn that he has cleared from that profusion of stones which\r\nlie under the wall; the scene which this point commands is truly\r\ndelicious; the house is on the edge of the lawn, by a wood which covers\r\nthe whole peninsula, fringes the slope at your feet, and forms a\r\nbeautiful shore to the lake.  Tomys and Glena are vast mountainous masses\r\nof incredible magnificence, the outline soft and easy in its swells,\r\nwhereas those above the eagle's nest are of so broken and abrupt an\r\noutline, that nothing can be imagined more savage, an aspect horrid and\r\nsublime, that gives all the impressions to be wished to astonish rather\r\nthan please the mind.  The Turk exhibits noble features, and Mangerton's\r\nhuge body rises above the whole.  The cultivated tracts towards Killarney\r\nform a shore in contrast to the terrific scenes I have just mentioned;\r\nthe distant boundary of the lake, a vast ridge of distant blue mountains\r\ntowards Dingle.  From hence entered the garden, and viewed Mucruss Abbey,\r\none of the most interesting scenes I ever saw; it is the ruin of a\r\nconsiderable abbey, built in Henry VI.'s time, and so entire, that if it\r\nwere more so, though the building would be more perfect, the ruin would\r\nbe less pleasing; it is half obscured in the shade of some venerable ash\r\ntrees; ivy has given the picturesque circumstance, which that plant alone\r\ncan confer, while the broken walls and ruined turrets throw over it\r\n\r\n    \"The last mournful graces of decay;\"\r\n\r\nheaps of skulls and bones scattered about, with nettles, briars, and\r\nweeds sprouting in tufts from the loose stones, all unite to raise those\r\nmelancholy impressions, which are the merit of such scenes, and which can\r\nscarcely anywhere be felt more completely.  The cloisters form a dismal\r\narea, in the centre of which grows the most prodigious yew-tree I ever\r\nbeheld, in one great stem, two feet diameter, and fourteen feet high,\r\nfrom whence a vast head of branches spreads on every side, so as to\r\nperform a perfect canopy to the whole space.  I looked for its fit\r\ninhabitant; it is a spot where\r\n\r\n    \"The moping owl doth to the moon complain.\"\r\n\r\nThis ruin is in the true style in which all such buildings should appear;\r\nthere is not an intruding circumstance, the hand of dress has not touched\r\nit, melancholy is the impression which such scenes should kindle, and it\r\nis here raised most powerfully.\r\n\r\nFrom the abbey we passed to the terrace, a natural one of grass, on the\r\nvery shore of the lake; it is irregular and winding; a wall of rocks\r\nbroken into fantastic forms by the waves: on the other side a wood,\r\nconsisting of all sorts of plants, which the climate can protect, and\r\nthrough which a variety of walks are traced.  The view from this terrace\r\nconsists of many parts of various characters, but in their different\r\nstyles complete; the lake opens a spreading sheet of water, spotted by\r\nrocks and islands, all but one or two wooded; the outlines of them are\r\nsharp and distinct; nothing can be more smiling than this scene, soft and\r\nmild, a perfect contrast of beauty to the sublimity of the mountains\r\nwhich form the shore: these rise in an outline, so varied, and at the\r\nsame time so magnificent, that nothing greater can be imagined; Tomys and\r\nGlena exhibit an immensity in point of magnitude, but from a large\r\nhanging wood on the slope, and from the smoothness of the general\r\nsurface, it has nothing savage, whereas the mountains above and near the\r\neagle's nest are of the most broken outlines; the declivities are bulging\r\nrocks, of immense size, which seem to impend in horrid forms over the\r\nlake, and where an opening among them is caught, others of the same rude\r\ncharacter rear their threatening heads.  From different parts of the\r\nterrace these scenes are viewed in numberless varieties.\r\n\r\nReturned to breakfast, and pursued Mr. Herbert's new road, which he has\r\ntraced through the peninsula to Dynis Island, three miles in length; and\r\nit is carried in so judicious a manner through a great variety of ground,\r\nrocky woods, lawns, etc., that nothing can be more pleasing; it passes\r\nthrough a remarkable scene of rocks, which are covered with woods.  From\r\nthence to the marble quarry, which Mr. Herbert is working, and where he\r\ngains variety of marbles, green, red, white, and brown, prettily veined;\r\nthe quarry is a shore of rocks, which surround a bay of the lake, and\r\nforms a scene consisting of but few parts, but those strongly marked; the\r\nrocks are bold, and broken into slight caverns; they are fringed with\r\nscattered trees, and from many parts of them wood shoots in that romantic\r\nmanner so common at Killarney.  Full in front Turk Mountain rises with\r\nthe proudest outline, in that abrupt magnificence which fills up the\r\nwhole space before one, and closes the scene.\r\n\r\nThe road leads by a place where copper-mines were worked; many shafts\r\nappear; as much ore was raised as sold for twenty-five thousand pounds,\r\nbut the works were laid aside, more from ignorance in the workmen than\r\nany defects in the mine.\r\n\r\nCame to the opening on the great lake, which appears to advantage here,\r\nthe town of Killarney on the north-east shore.  Look full on the mountain\r\nGlena, which rises in very bold manner, the hanging woods spread half\r\nway, and are of great extent, and uncommonly beautiful.  Two very\r\npleasing scenes succeed; that to the left is a small bay, hemmed in by a\r\nneck of land in front; the immediate shore rocks, which are in a\r\npicturesque style, and crowned entirely with arbutus, and other wood; a\r\npretty retired scene, where a variety of objects give no fatigue to the\r\neye.  The other is an admirable mixture of the beautiful and sublime: a\r\nbare rock of an almost regular figure projects from a headland into the\r\nlake, which, with much wood and highland, forms one side of the scene;\r\nthe other is wood from a rising ground only; the lake open between, in a\r\nsheet of no great extent, but in front is the hanging wood of Glena,\r\nwhich appears in full glory.\r\n\r\nMr. Herbert has built a handsome Gothic bridge, to unite the peninsula to\r\nthe island of Brickeen, through the arch of which the waters of the north\r\nand south lake flow.  It is a span of twenty-seven feet, and seventeen\r\nhigh, and over it the road leads to that island.  From thence to Brickeen\r\nnearly finished, and it is to be thrown across a bottom into Dynis.\r\n\r\nReturned by the northern path through a thick wood for some distance, and\r\ncaught a very agreeable view of Ash Island, seen through an opening,\r\ninclosed on both sides with wood.  Pursued the way from these grounds to\r\nKeelbeg, and viewed the bay of the Devil's Island, which is a beautiful\r\none, inclosed by a shore, to the right of very noble rocks in ledges and\r\nother forms, crowned in a striking manner with wood; a little rocky islet\r\nrises in front; to the left the water opens, and Turk Mountain rises with\r\nthat proud superiority which attends him in all these scenes.\r\n\r\nThe view of the promontory of Dindog, near this place, closes this part\r\nof the lake, and is indeed singularly beautiful.  It is a large rock,\r\nwhich shoots far into the water, of a height sufficient to be\r\ninteresting, in full relief, fringed with a scanty vegetation; the shore\r\non which you stand bending to the right, as if to meet that rock,\r\npresents a circular shade of dark wood: Turk still the background, in a\r\ncharacter of great sublimity, and Mangerton's loftier summit, but less\r\ninteresting outline, a part of the scenery.  These views, with others of\r\nless moment, are connected by a succession of lawns breaking among the\r\nwood, pleasing the eye with lively verdure, and relieving it from the\r\nfatigue of the stupendous mountain scenes.\r\n\r\nSeptember 28.  Took boat on the lake, from the promontory of Dindog\r\nbefore mentioned.  I had been under a million of apprehensions that I\r\nshould see no more of Killarney; for it blew a furious storm all night,\r\nand in the morning the bosom of the lake heaved with agitation,\r\nexhibiting few marks but those of anger.  After breakfast it cleared up,\r\nthe clouds dispersed by degrees, the waves subsided, the sun shone out in\r\nall its splendour; every scene was gay, and no ideas but pleasure\r\npossessed the breast.  With these emotions sallied forth, nor did they\r\ndisappoint us.\r\n\r\nRowed under the rocky shore of Dindog, which is romantic to a great\r\ndegree.  The base, by the beating of the waves, is worn into caverns, so\r\nthat the heads of the rocks project considerably beyond the base, and\r\nhang over in a manner which makes every part of it interesting.\r\nFollowing the coast, open marble quarry bay, the shore great fragments of\r\nrock tumbled about in the wildest manner.\r\n\r\nThe island of rocks against the copper-mine shore a remarkable group.\r\nThe shore near Casemilan is of a different nature; it is wood in some\r\nplaces, in unbroken masses down to the water's edge, in others divided\r\nfrom it by smaller tracts of rock.  Come to a beautiful land-locked bay,\r\nsurrounded by a woody shore, which, opening in places, shows other woods\r\nmore retired.  Tomys is here viewed in a unity of form, which gives it an\r\nair of great magnificence.  Turk was obscured by the sun shining\r\nimmediately above him, and, casting a stream of burning light on the\r\nwater, displayed an effect to describe which the pencil of a Claude alone\r\nwould be equal.  Turn out of the bay, and gain a full view of the Eagle's\r\nNest, the mountains above it, and Glena; they form a perfect contrast;\r\nthe first are rugged, but Glena mild.  Here the shore is a continued\r\nwood.\r\n\r\nPass the bridge, and cross to Dynis, an island Mr. Herbert has improved\r\nin the most agreeable manner, by cutting walks through it that command a\r\nvariety of views.  One of these paths on the banks of the channel to the\r\nupper lake is sketched with great taste; it is on one side walled with\r\nnatural rocks, from clefts of which shoot a thousand fine arbutuses, that\r\nhang in a rich foliage of flowers and scarlet berries; a turf bench in a\r\ndelicious spot; the scene close and sequestered, just enough to give\r\nevery pleasing idea annexed to retirement.\r\n\r\nPassing the bridge, by a rapid stream, came presently to the Eagle's\r\nNest: having viewed this rock from places where it appears only a part of\r\nan object much greater than itself, I had conceived an idea that it did\r\nnot deserve the applause given it, but upon coming near I was much\r\nsurprised; the approach is wonderfully fine, the river leads directly to\r\nits foot, and does not give the turn till immediately under, by which\r\nmeans the view is much more grand than it could otherwise be; it is\r\nnearly perpendicular, and rises in such full majesty, with so bold an\r\noutline, and such projecting masses in its centre, that the magnificence\r\nof the object is complete.  The lower part is covered with wood, and\r\nscattered trees climb almost to the top, which (if trees can be amiss in\r\nIreland) rather weaken the impression raised by this noble rock.  This\r\npart is a hanging wood, or an object whose character is perfect beauty;\r\nbut the upper scene, the broken outline, rugged sides, and bulging\r\nmasses, all are sublime, and so powerful, that sublimity is the general\r\nimpression of the whole, by overpowering the idea of beauty raised by the\r\nwood.  This immense height of the mountains of Killarney may be estimated\r\nby this rock; from any distant place that commands it, it appears the\r\nlowest crag of a vast chain, and of no account; but on a close approach\r\nit is found to command a very different respect.\r\n\r\nPass between the mountains called the Great Range, towards the upper\r\nlake.  Here Turk, which has so long appeared with a figure perfectly\r\ninteresting, is become, from a different position, an unmeaning lump.\r\nThe rest of the mountains, as you pass, assume a varied appearance, and\r\nare of a prodigious magnitude.  The scenery in this channel is great and\r\nwild in all its features; wood is very scarce; vast rocks seem tossed in\r\nconfusion through the narrow vale, which is opened among the mountains\r\nfor the river to pass.  Its banks are rocks in a hundred forms; the\r\nmountain-sides are everywhere scattered with them.  There is not a\r\ncircumstance but is in unison with the wild grandeur of the scene.\r\n\r\nColeman's Eye, a narrow pass, opens a different scenery.  Came to a\r\nregion in which the beautiful and the great are mixed without offence.\r\nThe islands are most of them thickly wooded.  Oak Isle in particular\r\nrises on a pretty base, and is a most beautiful object: Macgillicuddy\r\nReeks, with their broken points; Baum, with his perfect cone; the Purple\r\nMountain, with his broad and more regular head; and Turk, having assumed\r\na new and more interesting aspect, unite with the opposite hills, part of\r\nwhich have some wood left on them, to form a scene uncommonly striking.\r\nHere you look back on a very peculiar spot; it is a parcel of rocks which\r\ncross the lake, and form a gap that opens to distant water, the whole\r\nbacked by Turk, in a style of the highest grandeur.\r\n\r\nCome to Derry Currily, which is a great sweep of mountain, covered partly\r\nwith wood, hanging in a very noble manner, but part cut down, much of it\r\nmangled, and the rest inhabited by coopers, boat-builders, carpenters,\r\nand turners, a sacrilegious tribe, who have turned the Dryads from their\r\nancient habitations.  The cascade here is a fine one; but passed quickly\r\nfrom hence to scenes unmixed with pain.\r\n\r\nRow to the cluster of the Seven Islands, a little archipelago; they rise\r\nvery boldly from the water upon rocky bases, and are crowned in the most\r\nbeautiful manner with wood, among which are a number of arbutuses; the\r\nchannels among them opening to new scenes, and the great amphitheatre of\r\nrock and mountain that surround them unite to form a noble view.\r\n\r\nInto the river, at the very end of the lake, which winds towards\r\nMacgillicuddy Reeks in fanciful meanders.\r\n\r\nReturned by a course somewhat different, through the Seven Islands, and\r\nback to the Eagle's Nest, viewing the scenes already mentioned in new\r\npositions.  At that noble rock fired three cannon for the echo, which\r\nindeed is prodigious; the report does not consist of direct\r\nreverberations from one rock to another with a pause between, but has an\r\nexact resemblance to a peal of thunder rattling behind the rock, as if\r\ntravelling the whole scenery we had viewed, and lost in the immensity of\r\nMacgillicuddy Reeks.\r\n\r\nReturning through the bridge, turn to the left round Dynis Island, under\r\nthe woods of Glena; open on the cultivated country beyond the town of\r\nKillarney, and come gradually in sight of Innisfallen and Ross Island.\r\n\r\nPass near to the wood of Glena, which here takes the appearance of one\r\nimmense sweep hanging in the most beautiful manner imaginable, on the\r\nside of a vast mountain to a point, shooting into the great lake.  A more\r\nglorious scene is not to be imagined.  It is one deep mass of wood,\r\ncomposed of the richest shades perfectly dipping in the water, without\r\nrock or strand appearing, not a break in the whole.  The eye passing upon\r\nthe sheet of liquid silver some distance, to meet so entire a sweep of\r\nevery tint that can compose one vast mass of green, hanging to such an\r\nextent as to fill not only the eye but the imagination, unites in the\r\nwhole to form the most noble scene that is anywhere to be beheld.\r\n\r\nTurn under the north shore of Mucruss; the lake here is one great expanse\r\nof water, bounded by the woods described, the islands of Innisfallen,\r\nRoss, etc., and the peninsula.  The shore of Mucruss has a great variety;\r\nit is in some places rocky; huge masses tumbled from their base lie\r\nbeneath, as in a chaos of ruin.  Great caverns worn under them in a\r\nvariety of strange forms; or else covered with woods of a variety of\r\nshades.  Meet the point of Ardnagluggen (in English where the water\r\ndashes on the rocks) and come under Ornescope, a rocky headland of a most\r\nbold projection hanging many yards over its base, with an old\r\nweather-beaten yew growing from a little bracket of rock, from which the\r\nspot is called Ornescope, or yew broom.\r\n\r\nMucruss gardens presently open among the woods, and relieve the eye,\r\nalmost fatigued with the immense objects upon which it has so long gazed;\r\nthese softer scenes of lawn gently swelling among the shrubs and trees\r\nfinished the second day.\r\n\r\nSeptember 29.  Rode after breakfast to Mangerton Cascade and Drumarourk\r\nHill, from which the view of Mucruss is uncommonly pleasing.\r\n\r\nPass the other hill, the view of which I described the 27th, and went to\r\nColonel Huffy's monument, from whence the scene is different from the\r\nrest; the foreground is a gentle hill, intersected by hedges, forming\r\nseveral small lawns.  There are some scattered trees and houses, with\r\nMucruss Abbey half obscured by wood, the whole cheerful and backed by\r\nTurk.  The lake is of a triangular form, Ross Island and Innisfallen its\r\nlimits; the woods of Mucruss and the islands take a new position.\r\n\r\nReturning, took a boat again towards Ross Isle, and as Mucruss retires\r\nfrom us, nothing can be more beautiful than the spots of lawn in the\r\nterrace opening in the wood; above it the green hills with clumps, and\r\nthe whole finishing in the noble group of wood about the abbey, which\r\nhere appears a deep shade, and so fine a finishing one, that not a tree\r\nshould be touched.  Rowed to the east point of Ross, which is well\r\nwooded; turn to the south coast.  Doubling the point, the most beautiful\r\nshore of that island appears; it is the well-wooded environs of a bay,\r\nexcept a small opening to the castle; the woods are in deep shades, and\r\nrise on the regular slopes of a high range of rocky coast.  The part in\r\nfront of Filekilly point rises in the middle, and sinks towards each end.\r\nThe woods of Tomys here appear uncommonly fine.  Open Innisfallen, which\r\nis composed at this distance of the most various shades, within a broken\r\noutline, entirely different from the other islands, groups of different\r\nmasses rising in irregular tufts, and joined by lower trees.  No pencil\r\ncould mix a happier assemblage.  Land near a miserable room, where\r\ntravellers dine.  Of the isle of Innisfallen, it is paying no great\r\ncompliment to say it is the most beautiful in the king's dominions, and\r\nperhaps in Europe.  It contains twenty acres of land, and has every\r\nvariety that the range of beauty, unmixed with the sublime, can give.\r\nThe general feature is that of wood; the surface undulates into swelling\r\nhills, and sinks into little vales; the slopes are in every direction,\r\nthe declivities die gently away, forming those slight inequalities which\r\nare the greatest beauty of dressed grounds.  The little valleys let in\r\nviews of the surrounding lake between the hills, while the swells break\r\nthe regular outline of the water, and give to the whole an agreeable\r\nconfusion.  The wood has all the variety into which nature has thrown the\r\nsurface; in some parts it is so thick as to appear impenetrable, and\r\nsecludes all farther view; in others, it breaks into tufts of tall\r\ntimber, under which cattle feed.  Here they open, as if to offer to the\r\nspectator the view of the naked lawn; in others close, as if purposely to\r\nforbid a more prying examination.  Trees of large size and commanding\r\nfigure form in some places natural arches; the ivy mixing with the\r\nbranches, and hanging across in festoons of foliage, while on one side\r\nthe lake glitters among the trees, and on the other a thick gloom dwells\r\nin the recesses of the wood.  The figure of the island renders one part a\r\nbeautiful object to another; for the coast being broken and indented,\r\nforms bays surrounded either with rock or wood: slight promontories shoot\r\ninto the lake, whose rocky edges are crowned with wood.  These are the\r\ngreat features of Innisfallen; the slighter touches are full of beauties\r\neasily imagined by the reader.  Every circumstance of the wood, the\r\nwater, the rocks, and lawn, are characteristic, and have a beauty in the\r\nassemblage from mere disposition.  I must, however, observe that this\r\ndelicious retreat is not kept as one could wish.\r\n\r\nScenes that are great and commanding, from magnitude or wildness, should\r\nnever be dressed; the rugged, and even the horrible, may add to the\r\neffect upon the mind: but in such as Innisfallen, a degree of dress, that\r\nis, cleanliness, is even necessary to beauty.  I have spoken of lawn, but\r\nI should observe that expression indicates what it ought to be rather\r\nthan what it is.  It is very rich grass, poached by oxen and cows, the\r\nonly inhabitants of the island.  No spectator of taste but will regret\r\nthe open grounds not being drained with hollow cuts; the ruggedness of\r\nthe surface levelled, and the grass kept close shaven by many sheep\r\ninstead of beasts.  The bushes and briars, where they have encroached on\r\nwhat ought to be lawn, cleared away; some parts of the isle more opened;\r\nin a word no ornaments given, for the scene wants them not, but\r\nobstructions cleared, ruggedness smoothed, and the whole cleaned.  This\r\nis what ought to be done; as to what might be made of the island, if its\r\nnoble proprietor (Lord Kenmare) had an inclination, it admits of being\r\nconverted into a terrestrial paradise; lawning with the intermixture of\r\nother shrubs and wood, and a little dress, would make it an example of\r\nwhat ornamented grounds might be, but which not one in a thousand is.\r\nTake the island, however, as it is, with its few imperfections, and where\r\nare we to find such another?  What a delicious retreat! an emperor could\r\nnot bestow such a one as Innisfallen; with a cottage, a few cows, and a\r\nswarm of poultry, is it possible that happiness should refuse to be a\r\nguest here?\r\n\r\nRow to Ross Castle, in order to coast that island; there is nothing\r\npeculiarly striking in it; return the same way around Innisfallen.  In\r\nthis little voyage the shore of Ross is one of the most beautiful of the\r\nwooded ones in the lake; it seems to unite with Innisfallen, and projects\r\ninto the water in thick woods one beyond another.  In the middle of the\r\nchannel a large rock, and from the other shore a little promontory of a\r\nfew scattered trees; the whole scene pleasing.\r\n\r\nThe shore of Innisfallen has much variety, but in general it is woody,\r\nand of the beautiful character which predominates in that island.  One\r\nbay, at taking leave of it, is exceedingly pretty; it is a semicircular\r\none, and in the centre there is a projecting knoll of wood within a bay;\r\nthis is uncommon, and has an agreeable effect.\r\n\r\nThe near approach to Tomys exhibits a sweep of wood, so great in extent,\r\nand so rich in foliage, that no person can see without admiring it.  The\r\nmountainous part above is soon excluded by the approach; wood alone is\r\nseen, and that in such a noble range as to be greatly striking; it just\r\nhollows into a bay, and in the centre of it is a chasm in the wood; this\r\nis a bed of a considerable stream, which forms O'Sullivan's cascade, to\r\nwhich all strangers are conducted, as one of the principal beauties of\r\nKillarney.  Landed to the right of it, and walked under the thick shade\r\nof the wood, over a rocky declivity, close to the torrent stream, which\r\nbreaks impetuously from rock to rock, with a roar that kindles\r\nexpectation.  The picture in your fancy will not exceed the reality; a\r\ngreat stream bursts from the deep bosom of a wooded glen, hollowed into a\r\nretired recess of rocks and trees, itself a most pleasing and romantic\r\nspot, were there not a drop of water: the first fall is many feet\r\nperpendicularly over a rock; to the eye it immediately makes another, the\r\nbasin into which it pours being concealed; from this basin it forces\r\nitself impetuously between two rocks.  This second fall is also of a\r\nconsiderable height; but the lower one, the third, is the most\r\nconsiderable; it issues in the same manner from a basin hid from the\r\npoint of view.  These basins being large, there appears a space of\r\nseveral yards between each fall, which adds much to the picturesque\r\nscenery; the whole is within an arch of wood, that hangs over it; the\r\nquantity of water is so considerable, as to make an almost deafening\r\nnoise, and uniting with the torrent below, where the fragments of rock\r\nare large and numerous, throw an air of grandeur over the whole.  It is\r\nabout seventy feet high.  Coast from hence the woody shores of Tomys and\r\nGlena; they are upon the whole much the most beautiful ones I have\r\nanywhere seen; Glena woods having more oak, and some arbutuses, are the\r\nfiner and deeper shades; Tomys has a great quantity of birch, whose\r\nfoliage is not so luxuriant.  The reader may figure to himself what these\r\nwoods are, when he is informed that they fill an unbroken extent of six\r\nmiles in length, and from half a mile to a mile and a half in breadth,\r\nall hanging on the sides of two vast mountains, and coming down with a\r\nfull robe of rich luxuriance to the very water's edge.  The acclivity of\r\nthese hills is such, that every tree appears full to the eye.  The\r\nvariety of the ground is great; in some places great swells in the\r\nmountain-side, with corresponding hollows, present concave and convex\r\nmasses; in others, considerable ridges of land and rock rise from the\r\nsweep, and offer to the astonished eye yet other varieties of shade.\r\nSmaller mountains rise regularly from the immense bosom of the larger,\r\nand hold forth their sylvan heads, backed by yet higher woods.  To give\r\nall the varieties of this immense scenery of forest is impossible.  Above\r\nthe whole is a prodigious mass of mountain, of a gently swelling outline\r\nand soft appearance, varying as the sun or clouds change their position,\r\nbut never becoming rugged or threatening to the eye.\r\n\r\nThe variations are best seen by rowing near the shore, when every stroke\r\nof the oar gives a new outline, and fresh tints to please the eye: but\r\nfor one great impression, row about two miles from the shore of Glena; at\r\nthat distance the inequalities in the surface are no longer seen, but the\r\neye is filled with so immense a range of wood, crowned with a mountain in\r\nperfect unison with itself, that objects, whose character is that of\r\nbeauty, are here, from their magnitude, truly magnificent, and attended\r\nwith a most forcible expression.--Returned to Mucruss.\r\n\r\nSeptember 30.  This morning I had dedicated to the ascent of Mangerton,\r\nbut his head was so enshrouded in clouds, and the weather so bad, that I\r\nwas forced to give up the scheme: Mr. Herbert has measured him with very\r\naccurate instruments, of which he has a great collection, and found his\r\nheight eight hundred and thirty-five yards above the level of the sea.\r\nThe Devil's Punch-bowl, from the description I had of it, must be the\r\ncrater of an exhausted volcano: there are many signs of them about\r\nKillarney, particularly vast rocks on the sides of mountains, in streams,\r\nas if they had rolled from the top in one direction.  Brown stone rocks\r\nare also sometimes found on lime-quarries, tossed thither perhaps in some\r\nvast eruption.\r\n\r\nIn my way from Killarney to Castle Island, rode into Lord Kenmare's park,\r\nfrom whence there is another beautiful view of the lake, different from\r\nmany of the preceding; there is a broad margin of cultivated country at\r\nyour feet, to lead the eye gradually in the lake, which exhibits her\r\nislands to this point more distinctly than to any other, and the\r\nbackgrounds of the mountains of Glena and Tomys give a bold relief.\r\n\r\nUpon the whole, Killarney, among the lakes that I have seen, can scarcely\r\nbe said to have a rival.  The extent of water in Loch Earne is much\r\ngreater, the islands more numerous, and some scenes near Castle Caldwell\r\nof perhaps as great magnificence.  The rocks at Keswick are more sublime,\r\nand other lakes may have circumstances in which they are superior; but\r\nwhen we consider the prodigious woods of Killarney, the immensity of the\r\nmountains, the uncommon beauty of the promontory of Mucruss and the Isle\r\nof Innisfallen, the character of the islands, the singular circumstance\r\nof the arbutus, and the uncommon echoes, it will appear, upon the whole,\r\nto be in reality superior to all comparison.\r\n\r\nBefore I quit it I have one other observation to make, which is relative\r\nto the want of accommodations and extravagant expense of strangers\r\nresiding at Killarney.  I speak it not at all feelingly, thanks to Mr.\r\nHerbert's hospitality, but from the accounts given me: the inns are\r\nmiserable, and the lodgings little better.  I am surprised somebody with\r\na good capital does not procure a large well-built inn, to be erected on\r\nthe immediate shore of the lake, in an agreeable situation, at a distance\r\nfrom the town; there are very few places where such a one would answer\r\nbetter; there ought to be numerous and good apartments.  A large\r\nrendezvous-room for billiards, cards, dancing, music, etc., to which the\r\ncompany might resort when they chose it; an ordinary for those that like\r\ndining in public; boats of all sorts, nets for fishing, and as great a\r\nvariety of amusements as could be collected, especially within doors; for\r\nthe climate being very rainy, travellers wait with great impatience in a\r\ndirty common inn, which they would not do if they were in the midst of\r\nsuch accommodations as they meet with at an English spa.  But above all,\r\nthe prices of everything, from a room and a dinner to a barge and a band\r\nof music, to be reasonable, and hung up in every part of the house.  The\r\nresort of strangers to Killarney would then be much increased, and their\r\nstay would be greatly prolonged; they would not view it post-haste, and\r\nfly away the first moment to avoid dirt and imposition.  A man with a\r\ngood capital and some ingenuity would, I think, make a fortune by fixing\r\nhere upon such principles.\r\n\r\nThe state of the poor in the whole county of Kerry represented as\r\nexceedingly miserable, and owing to the conduct of men of property, who\r\nare apt to lay the blame on what they call land pirates, or men who offer\r\nthe highest rent, and who, in order to pay this rent, must and do re-let\r\nall the cabin lands at an extravagant rise, which is assigning over all\r\nthe cabins to be devoured by one farmer.  The cottars on a farm cannot go\r\nfrom one to another, in order to find a good master, as in England; for\r\nall the country is in the same system, and no redress to be found.  Such\r\nbeing the case, the farmers are enabled to charge the price of labour as\r\nlow as they please, and rate the land as high as they like.  This is an\r\nevil which oppresses them cruelly, and certainly has its origin in its\r\nlandlords when they set their farms, setting all the cabins with them,\r\ninstead of keeping them tenants to themselves.  The oppression is, the\r\nfarmer valuing the labour of the poor at fourpence or fivepence a day,\r\nand paying that in land rated much above its value.  Owing to this the\r\npoor are depressed; they live upon potatoes and sour milk, and the\r\npoorest of them only salt and water to them, with now and then a herring.\r\nTheir milk is bought; for very few keep cows, scarce any pigs, but a few\r\npoultry.  Their circumstances are incomparably worse than they were\r\ntwenty years ago; for they had all cows, but then they wore no linen: all\r\nnow have a little flax.  To these evils have been owing emigrations,\r\nwhich have been considerable.\r\n\r\nTo the west of Tralee are the Mahagree Islands, famous for their corn\r\nproducts; they are rock and sand, stocked with rabbits; near them a sandy\r\ntract, twelve miles long, and one mile broad, to the north, with the\r\nmountains to the south, famous for the best wheat in Kerry; all under the\r\nplough.\r\n\r\nArriving at Ardfert, Lord Crosby, whose politeness I have every reason to\r\nremember, was so obliging as to carry me by one of the finest strands I\r\never rode upon, to view the mouth of the Shannon at Ballengary, the site\r\nof an old fort.  It is a vast rock, separated from the country by a chasm\r\nof prodigious depth, through which the waves drive.  The rocks of the\r\ncoast here are in the boldest style, and hollowed by the furious Atlantic\r\nwaves into caverns in which they roar.  It was a dead calm, yet the swell\r\nwas so heavy, that the great waves rolled in and broke upon the rocks\r\nwith such violence as to raise an immense foam, and give one an idea of\r\nwhat a storm would be; but fancy rarely falls short in her pictures.  The\r\nview of the Shannon is exceedingly noble; it is eight miles over, the\r\nmouth formed by two headlands of very high and bold cliffs, and the reach\r\nof the river in view very extensive; it is an immense scenery: perhaps\r\nthe noblest mouth of a river in Europe.\r\n\r\nArdfert is very near the sea, so near it that single trees or rows are\r\ncut in pieces with the wind, yet about Lord Glendour's house there are\r\nextensive plantations exceedingly flourishing, many fine ash and beech;\r\nabout a beautiful Cistercian abbey, and a silver fir of forty-eight\r\nyears' growth, of an immense height and size.\r\n\r\nOctober 3.  Left Ardfert, accompanying Lord Crosby to Listowel.  Called\r\nin the way to view Lixnaw, the ancient seat of the Earls of Kerry, but\r\ndeserted for ten years past, and now presents so melancholy a scene of\r\ndesolation, that it shocked me to see it.  Everything around lies in\r\nruin, and the house itself is going fast off by thieving depredations of\r\nthe neighbourhood.  I was told a curious anecdote of this estate; which\r\nshows wonderfully the improvement of Ireland.  The present Earl of\r\nKerry's grandfather, Thomas, agreed to lease the whole estate for 1,500\r\npounds a year to a Mr. Collis for ever, but the bargain went off upon a\r\ndispute whether the money should be paid at Cork or Dublin.  Those very\r\nlands are now let at 20,000 pounds a year.  There is yet a good deal of\r\nwood, particularly a fine ash grove, planted by the present Earl of\r\nShelburne's father.\r\n\r\nProceeded to Woodford, Robert Fitzgerald's, Esq., passing Listowel\r\nBridge; the vale leading to it is very fine, the river is broad, the\r\nlands high, and one side a very extensive hanging wood, opening on those\r\nof Woodford in a pleasing style.\r\n\r\nWoodford is an agreeable scene; close to the house is a fine winding\r\nriver under a bank of thick wood, with the view of an old castle hanging\r\nover it.\r\n\r\nIn 1765, Mr. Fitzgerald was travelling from Constantinople to Warsaw, and\r\na waggon with his baggage heavily laden overset; the country people\r\nharnessed two buffaloes by the horns, in order to draw it over, which\r\nthey did with ease.  In some very instructive conversation I had with\r\nthis gentleman on the subject of his travels, this circumstance\r\nparticularly struck me.\r\n\r\nOctober 4.  From Woodford to Tarbat, the seat of Edward Leslie, Esq.,\r\nthrough a country rather dreary, till it came upon Tarbat, which is so\r\nmuch the contrary that it appeared to the highest advantage; the house is\r\non the edge of a beautiful lawn, with a thick margin of full grown wood,\r\nhanging on a steep bank to the Shannon, so that the river is seen from\r\nthe house over the tops of this wood, which being of a broken irregular\r\noutline has an effect very striking and uncommon; the river is two or\r\nthree miles broad here, and the opposite coast forms a promontory which\r\nhas from Tarbat exactly the appearance of a large island.  To the east,\r\nthe river swells into a triangular lake, with a reach opening at the\r\ndistant corner of it to Limerick.  The union of wood, water, and lawn\r\nforms upon the whole a very fine scene; the river is very magnificent.\r\nFrom the hill on the coast above the island, the lawn and wood appear\r\nalso to great advantage.  But the finest point of view is from the higher\r\nhill on the other side of the house, which looking down on all these\r\nscenes, they appear as a beautiful ornament to the Shannon, which spreads\r\nforth its proud course from two to nine miles wide, surrounded by\r\nhighlands; a scenery truly magnificent.\r\n\r\nThe state of the poor is something better than it was twenty years ago,\r\nparticularly their clothing, cattle, and cabins.  They live upon potatoes\r\nand milk; all have cows, and when they dry them, buy others.  They also\r\nhave butter, and most of them keep pigs, killing them for their own use.\r\nThey have also herrings.  They are in general in the cottar system, of\r\npaying for labour by assigning some land to each cabin.  The country is\r\ngreatly more populous than twenty years ago, and is now increasing; and\r\nif ever so many cabins were built by a gradual increase, tenants would be\r\nfound for them.  A cabin and five acres of land will let for 4 pounds a\r\nyear.  The industrious cottar, with two, three, or four acres, would be\r\nexceedingly glad to have his time to himself, and have such an annual\r\naddition of land as he was able to manage, paying a fair rent for it;\r\nnone would decline it but the idle and worthless.\r\n\r\nTithes are all annually valued by the proctors, and charged very high.\r\nThere are on the Shannon about one hundred boats employed in bringing\r\nturf to Limerick from the coast of Kerry and Clare, and in fishing; the\r\nformer carry from twenty to twenty-five tons, the latter from five to\r\nten, and are navigated each by two men and a boy.\r\n\r\nOctober 5.  Passed through a very unentertaining country (except for a\r\nfew miles on the bank of the Shannon) to Altavilla, but Mr. Bateman being\r\nfrom home, I was disappointed in getting an account of the palatines\r\nsettled in his neighbourhood.  Kept the road to Adair, where Mrs. Quin,\r\nwith a politeness equalled only by her understanding, procured me every\r\nintelligence I wished for.\r\n\r\nPalatines were settled here by the late Lord Southwell about seventy\r\nyears ago.\r\n\r\nThey preserve some of their German customs: sleep between two beds.  They\r\nappoint a burgomaster, to whom they appeal in case of all disputes; and\r\nthey yet preserve their language, but that is declining.  They are very\r\nindustrious, and in consequence are much happier and better fed, clothed,\r\nand lodged than the Irish peasants.  We must not, however, conclude from\r\nhence that all is owing to this; their being independent farmers, and\r\nhaving leases, are circumstances which will create industry.  Their crops\r\nare much better than those of their neighbours.  There are three villages\r\nof them, about seventy families in all.  For some time after they settled\r\nthey fed upon sour-crout, but by degrees left it off, and took to\r\npotatoes; but now subsist upon them and butter and milk, but with a great\r\ndeal of oat bread, and some of wheat, some meat and fowls, of which they\r\nraise many.  They have all offices to their houses, that is, stables and\r\ncow-houses, and a lodge for their ploughs, etc.  They keep their cows in\r\nthe house in winter, feeding them upon hay and oat straw.  They are\r\nremarkable for the goodness and cleanliness of their houses.  The women\r\nare very industrious, reap the corn, plough the ground sometimes, and do\r\nwhatever work may be going on; they also spin, and make their children do\r\nthe same.  Their wheat is much better than any in the country, insomuch\r\nthat they get a better price than anybody else.  Their industry goes so\r\nfar, that jocular reports of its excess are spread.  In a very pinching\r\nseason, one of them yoked his wife against a horse, and went in that\r\nmanner to work, and finished a journey at plough.  The industry of the\r\nwomen is a perfect contrast to the Irish ladies in the cabins, who cannot\r\nbe persuaded, on any consideration, even to make hay, it not being the\r\ncustom of the country, yet they bind corn, and do other works more\r\nlaborious.  Mrs. Quin, who is ever attentive to introduce whatever can\r\ncontribute to their welfare and happiness, offered many premiums to\r\ninduce them to make hay, of hats, cloaks, stockings, etc. etc., but all\r\nwould not do.\r\n\r\nFew places have so much wood about them as Adair; Mr. Quin has above one\r\nthousand acres in his hands, in which a large proportion is under wood.\r\nThe deer park of four hundred acres is almost full of old oak and very\r\nfine thorns, of a great size; and about the house, the plantations are\r\nvery extensive, of elm and other wood, but that thrives better than any\r\nother sort.  I have nowhere seen finer than vast numbers here.  There is\r\na fine river runs under the house, and within view are no less than three\r\nruins of Franciscan friaries, two of them remarkably beautiful, and one\r\nhas most of the parts perfect, except the roof.\r\n\r\nIn Mr. Quin's house there are some very good pictures, particularly an\r\nAnnunciation by Domenichino, which is a beautiful piece.  It was brought\r\nlately from Italy by Mr. Quin, junior.  The colours are rich and mellow,\r\nand the hairs of the heads inimitably pleasing; the group of angels at\r\nthe top, to the left of the piece, is very natural.  It is a piece of\r\ngreat merit.  The companion is a Magdalen; the expression of melancholy,\r\nor rather misery, remarkably strong.  There is a gloom in the whole in\r\nfull unison with the subject.  There are, besides these, some others\r\ninferior, yet of merit, and two very good portraits of Lord Dartry (Mrs.\r\nQuin's brother), and of Mr. Quin, junior, by Pompeio Battoni.  A piece in\r\nan uncommon style, done on oak, of Esther and Ahasuerus; the colours\r\ntawdry, but the grouping attitudes and effect pleasing.\r\n\r\nCastle Oliver is a place almost entirely of Mr. Oliver's creation; from a\r\nhouse, surrounded with cabins and rubbish, he has fixed it in a fine\r\nlawn, surrounded by good wood.  The park he has very much improved on an\r\nexcellent plan; by means of seven feet hurdles, he fences off part of it\r\nthat wants to be cleaned or improved; these he cultivates, and leaves for\r\ngrass, and then takes another spot, which is by much the best way of\r\ndoing it.  In the park is a glen, an English mile long, winding in a\r\npleasing manner, with much wood hanging on the banks.  Mr. Oliver has\r\nconducted a stream through this vale, and formed many little water-falls\r\nin an exceedingly good taste, chiefly overhung with wood, but in some\r\nplaces open with several little rills, trickling over stones down the\r\nslopes.  A path winds through a large wood and along the brow of the\r\nglen; this path leads to a hermitage, a cave of rock, in a good taste,\r\nand to some benches, from which the views of the water and wood are in\r\nthe sequestered style they ought to be.  One of these little views, which\r\ncatches several falls under the arch of the bridge, is one of the\r\nprettiest touches of the kind I have seen.  The vale beneath the house,\r\nwhen viewed from the higher grounds, is pleasing; it is very well wooded,\r\nthere being many inclosures, surrounded by pine trees, and a thick fine\r\nmass of wood rises from them up the mountain-side, makes a very good\r\nfigure, and would be better, had not Mr. Oliver's father cut it into\r\nvistas for shooting.  Upon the whole, the place is highly improved, and\r\nwhen the mountains are planted, in which Mr. Oliver is making a\r\nconsiderable progress, it will be magnificent.\r\n\r\nIn the house are several fine pictures, particularly five pieces by Seb.\r\nRicci, Venus and AEneas; Apollo and Pan; Venus and Achilles; and Pyrrhus\r\nand Andromache, by Lazzerini; and the Rape of the Lapithi by the\r\nCentaurs.  The last is by much the finest, and is a very capital piece;\r\nthe expression is strong, the figures are in bold relief, and the\r\ncolouring good.  Venus and Achilles is a pleasing picture; the continence\r\nof Scipio is well grouped, but Scipio, as in every picture I ever saw of\r\nhim, has no expression.  Indeed, chastity is in the countenance so\r\npassive a virtue as not to be at all suited to the genius of painting;\r\nthe idea is rather that of insipidity, and accordingly Scipio's\r\nexpression is generally insipid enough.  Two fine pieces, by Lucca\r\nJordano, Hercules and Anteus; Samson Killing the Lion: both dark and\r\nhorrid, but they are highly finished and striking.  Six heads of old men,\r\nby Nagori, excellent; and four young women, in the character of the\r\nseasons.\r\n\r\nOctober 9.  Left Castle Oliver.  Had I followed my inclination, my stay\r\nwould have been much longer, for I found it equally the residence of\r\nentertainment and instruction.  Passed through Kilfennan and\r\nDuntreleague, in my way to Tipperary.  The road leads everywhere on the\r\nsides of the hills, so as to give a very distinct view of the lower\r\ngrounds; the soil all the way is the same sort of sandy reddish loam I\r\nhave already described, incomparable land for tillage: as I advanced it\r\ngrew something lighter, and in many places free from gravel.  Bullocks\r\nthe stock all the way.  Towards Tipperary I saw vast numbers of sheep,\r\nand many bullocks.  All this line of country is part of the famous golden\r\nvale.  To Thomas Town, where I was so unfortunate as not to find Mr.\r\nMatthew at home; the domain is one thousand five hundred English acres,\r\nso well planted that I could hardly believe myself in Ireland.  There is\r\na hill in the park from which the view of it, the country and the\r\nGalties, are striking.\r\n\r\nOctober 12.  To Lord de Montalt's, at Dundrum, a place which his lordship\r\nhas ornamented in the modern style of improvement: the house was situated\r\nin the midst of all the regular exertions of the last age.  Parterres,\r\nparapets of earth, straight walks, knots and clipped hedges, all which he\r\nhas thrown down, with an infinite number of hedges and ditches, filled up\r\nponds, etc., and opened one very noble lawn around him, scattered\r\nnegligently over with trees, and cleared the course of a choked-up river,\r\nso that it flows at present in a winding course through the grounds.\r\n\r\nOctober 13.  Leaving Dundrum, passed through Cashel, where is a rock and\r\nruin on it, called the Rock of Cashel, supposed to be of the remotest\r\nantiquity.  Towards Clonmel, the whole way through the same rich vein of\r\nred sandy loam I have so often mentioned: I examined it in several\r\nfields, and found it to be of an extraordinary fertility, and as fine\r\nturnip land as ever I saw.  It is much under sheep; but towards Clonmel\r\nthere is a great deal of tillage.\r\n\r\nThe first view of that town, backed by a high ridge of mountains, with a\r\nbeautiful space near it of inclosures, fringed with a scattering of\r\ntrees, was very pleasing.  It is the best situated place in the county of\r\nTipperary, on the Suir, which brings up boats of ten tons burthen.  It\r\nappears to be a busy populous place, yet I was told that the manufacture\r\nof woollens is not considerable.  It is noted for being the birthplace of\r\nthe inimitable Sterne.\r\n\r\nTo Sir William Osborne's, three miles the other side Clonmel.  From a\r\ncharacter so remarkable for intelligence and precision, I could not fail\r\nof meeting information of the most valuable kind.  This gentleman has\r\nmade a mountain improvement which demands particular attention, being\r\nupon a principle very different from common ones.\r\n\r\nTwelve years ago he met with a hearty-looking fellow of forty, followed\r\nby a wife and six children in rags, who begged.  Sir William questioned\r\nhim upon the scandal of a man in full health and vigour, supporting\r\nhimself in such a manner: the man said he could get no work: \"Come along\r\nwith me, I will show you a spot of land upon which I will build a cabin\r\nfor you, and if you like it you shall fix there.\"  The fellow followed\r\nSir William, who was as good as his word: he built him a cabin, gave him\r\nfive acres of a heathy mountain, lent him four pounds to stock with, and\r\ngave him, when he had prepared his ground, as much lime as he would come\r\nfor.  The fellow flourished; he went on gradually; repaid the four\r\npounds, and presently became a happy little cottar: he has at present\r\ntwelve acres under cultivation, and a stock in trade worth at least 80\r\npounds; his name is John Conory.\r\n\r\nThe success which attended this man in two or three years brought others\r\nwho applied for land, and Sir William gave them as they applied.  The\r\nmountain was under lease to a tenant, who valued it so little, that upon\r\nbeing reproached with not cultivating, or doing something with it, he\r\nassured Sir William that it was utterly impracticable to do anything with\r\nit, and offered it to him without any deduction of rent.  Upon this\r\nmountain he fixed them; gave them terms as they came determinable with\r\nthe lease of the farm, so that every one that came in succession had\r\nshorter and shorter tenures; yet are they so desirous of settling, that\r\nthey come at present, though only two years remain for a term.\r\n\r\nIn this manner Sir William has fixed twenty-two families, who are all\r\nupon the improving hand, the meanest growing richer; and find themselves\r\nso well off, that no consideration will induce them to work for others,\r\nnot even in harvest: their industry has no bounds; nor is the day long\r\nenough for the revolution of their incessant labour.  Some of them bring\r\nturf to Clonmel, and Sir William has seen Conory returning loaded with\r\nsoap ashes.\r\n\r\nHe found it difficult to persuade them to make a road to their village,\r\nbut when they had once done it, he found none in getting cross roads to\r\nit, they found such benefit in the first.  Sir William has continued to\r\ngive whatever lime they come for: and they have desired one thousand\r\nbarrels among them for the year 1766, which their landlord has\r\naccordingly contracted for with his lime-burner, at 11d. a barrel.  Their\r\nhouses have all been built at his expense, and done by contract at 6\r\npounds each, after which they raise what little offices they want for\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nOctober 15.  Left New Town, and keeping on the banks of the Suir, passed\r\nthrough Carrick to Curraghmore, the seat of the Earl of Tyrone.  This\r\nline of country, in point of soil, inferior to what I have of late gone\r\nthrough: so that I consider the rich country to end at Clonmel.\r\n\r\nEmigrations from this part of Ireland principally to Newfoundland: for a\r\nseason they have 18 or 20 pounds for their pay, and are maintained, but\r\nthey do not bring home more than 7 to 11 pounds.  Some of them stay and\r\nsettle; three years ago there was an emigration of indented servants to\r\nNorth Carolina of three hundred, but they were stopped by contrary winds,\r\netc.  There had been something of this constantly, but not to that\r\namount.  The oppression which the poor people have most to complain of is\r\nthe not having any tenures in their lands, by which means they are\r\nentirely subject to their employers.\r\n\r\nManufactures here are only woollens.  Carrick is one of the greatest\r\nmanufacturing towns in Ireland.  Principally for ratteens, but of late\r\nthey have got into broadcloths, all for home consumption; the manufacture\r\nincreases, and is very flourishing.  There are between three and four\r\nhundred people employed by it in Carrick and its neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nCurraghmore is one of the finest places in Ireland, or indeed that I have\r\nanywhere seen.  The house, which is large, is situated upon a rising\r\nground, in a vale surrounded by very bold hills, which rise in a variety\r\nof forms and offer to the eye, in rising through the grounds, very noble\r\nand striking scenes.  These hills are exceedingly varied, so that the\r\ndetour of the place is very pleasing.  In order to see it to advantage, I\r\nwould advise a traveller to take the ride which Lord Tyrone carried me.\r\nPassed through the deer-park wood of old oaks, spread over the side of a\r\nbold hill, and of such an extent, that the scene is a truly forest one,\r\nwithout any other boundary in view than what the stems of trees offer\r\nfrom mere extent, retiring one behind another till they thicken so much\r\nto the eye, under the shade of their spreading tops, as to form a distant\r\nwall of wood.  This is a sort of scene not common in Ireland; it is a\r\ngreat extent alone that will give it.  From this hill enter an evergreen\r\nplantation, a scene which winds up the deer-park hill, and opens on to\r\nthe brow of it, which commands a most noble view indeed.  The lawns round\r\nthe house appear at one's feet, at the bottom of a great declivity of\r\nwood, almost everywhere surrounded by plantations.  The hills on the\r\nopposite side of the vale against the house consist of a large lawn in\r\nthe centre of the two woods, that to the right of an immense extent,\r\nwhich waves over a mountain-side in the finest manner imaginable, and\r\nlead the eye to the scenery on the left, which is a beautiful vale of\r\nrich inclosures, of several miles extent, with the Suir making one great\r\nreach through it, and a bold bend just before it enters a gap in the\r\nhills towards Waterford, and winds behind them; to the right you look\r\nover a large plain, backed by the great Cummeragh Mountains.  For a\r\ndistinct extent of view, the parts of which are all of a commanding\r\nmagnitude, and a variety equal to the number, very few prospects are\r\nfiner than this.\r\n\r\nFrom hence the boundary plantation extends some miles to the west and\r\nnorth-west of the domain, forming a margin to the whole of different\r\ngrowths, having been planted, by degrees, from three to sixteen years.\r\nIt is in general well grown, and the trees thriven exceedingly,\r\nparticularly the oak, beech, larch, and firs.  It is very well sketched,\r\nwith much variety given to it.\r\n\r\nPass by the garden across the river which murmurs over a rocky bed, and\r\nfollow the riding up a steep hill, covered with wood from some breaks, in\r\nwhich the house appears perfectly buried in a deep wood, and come out,\r\nafter a considerable extent of ride, into the higher lawn, which commands\r\na view of the scenery about the house; and from the brow of the hill the\r\nwater, which is made to imitate a river, has a good effect, and throws a\r\ngreat air of cheerfulness over the scene, for from hence the declivity\r\nbelow it is hid.  But the view, which is the most pleasing from hence,\r\nthe finest at Curraghmore, and indeed one of the most striking that is\r\nanywhere to be seen, is that of the hanging wood to the right of the\r\nhouse, rising in so noble a sweep as perfectly to fill the eye, and leave\r\nthe fancy scarce anything to wish: at the bottom is a small semicircular\r\nlawn, around which flows the river, under the immediate shade of very\r\nnoble oaks.  The whole wood rises boldly from the bottom, tree above\r\ntree, to a vast height, of large oak.  The masses of shade are but tints\r\nof one colour; it is not chequered with a variety.  There is a majestic\r\nsimplicity, a unity in the whole, which is attended with an uncommon\r\nimpression, and such as none but the most magnificent scenes can raise.\r\n\r\nDescending from hence through the roads, the riding crosses the river,\r\nand passes through the meadow which has such an effect in the preceding\r\nscene, from which also the view is very fine, and leads home through a\r\ncontinued and an extensive range of fine oak, partly on a declivity, at\r\nthe bottom of which the river murmurs its broken course.\r\n\r\nBesides this noble riding, there is a very agreeable walk runs\r\nimmediately on the banks of the river, which is perfect in its style; it\r\nis a sequestered line of wood, so high on the declivities in some places,\r\nand so thick on the very edge in others, overspreading the river, that\r\nthe character of the scene is gloom and melancholy, heightened by the\r\nnoise of the water falling from stone to stone.  There is a considerable\r\nvariety in the banks of it, and in the figures and growth of the wood,\r\nbut none that hurts the impression, which is well preserved throughout.\r\n\r\nOctober 17.  Accompanied Lord Tyrone to Waterford; made some inquiries\r\ninto the state of their trade, but found it difficult, from the method in\r\nwhich the custom-house books are kept, to get the details I wished; but\r\nin the year following, having the pleasure of a long visit at\r\nBallycanvan, the seat of Cornelius Bolton, Esq., his son, the member for\r\nthe city, procured me every information I could wish, and that in so\r\nliberal and polite a manner, that it would not be easy to express the\r\nobligations I am under to both.  In general, I was informed that the\r\ntrade of the place had increased considerably in ten years, both the\r\nexports and imports--the exports of the products of pasturage, full\r\none-third in twelve years.  That the staple trade of the place is the\r\nNewfoundland trade.  This is very much increased; there is more of it\r\nhere than anywhere.  The number of people who go as passengers in the\r\nNewfoundland ships is amazing: from sixty to eighty ships, and from three\r\nthousand to five thousand annually.  They come from most parts of\r\nIreland, from Cork, Kerry, etc.  Experienced men will get eighteen to\r\ntwenty-five pounds for the season, from March to November.  A man who\r\nnever went will have five to seven pounds and his passage, and others\r\nrise to twenty pounds; the passage out they get, but pay home two pounds.\r\nAn industrious man in a year will bring home twelve to sixteen pounds\r\nwith him, and some more.  A great point for them is to be able to carry\r\nout all their slops, for everything there is exceedingly dear, one or two\r\nhundred per cent. dearer than they can get them at home.  They are not\r\nallowed to take out any woollen goods but for their own use.  The ships\r\ngo loaded with pork, beef, butter, and some salt; and bring home\r\npassengers, or get freights where they can; sometimes rum.  The Waterford\r\npork comes principally from the barony of Iverk, in Kilkenny, where they\r\nfatten great numbers of large hogs; for many weeks together they kill\r\nhere three to four thousand a week, the price fifty shillings to four\r\npounds each; goes chiefly to Newfoundland.  One was killed in Mr.\r\nPenrose's cellar that weighed five hundredweight and a quarter, and\r\nmeasured from the nose to the end of the tail nine feet four inches.\r\n\r\nThere is a foundry at Waterford for pots, kettles, weights, and all\r\ncommon utensils; and a manufactory by Messrs. King and Tegent of anvils\r\nto anchors, twenty hundredweight, etc., which employs forty hands.\r\nSmiths earn from 6s. to 24s. a week.  Nailers from 10s. to 12s.  And\r\nanother less considerable.  There are two sugar-houses, and many\r\nsalt-houses.  The salt is boiled over lime-kilns.\r\n\r\nThere is a fishery upon the coast of Waterford, for a great variety of\r\nfish, herrings particularly, in the mouth of Waterford Harbour, and two\r\nyears ago in such quantities there, that the tides left the ditches full\r\nof them.  There are some premium boats both here and at Dungarvan, but\r\nthe quantity of herrings barrelled is not considerable.\r\n\r\nThe butter trade of Waterford has increased greatly for seven years past;\r\nit comes from Waterford principally, but much from Carlow; for it comes\r\nfrom twenty miles beyond Carlow, for sixpence per hundred.  From the 1st\r\nof January, 1774, to the 1st of January, 1775, there were exported\r\nfifty-nine thousand eight hundred and fifty-six casks of butter, each, on\r\nan average, one hundredweight, at the mean price of 50s.  Revenue of\r\nWaterford, 1751, 17,000 pounds; 1776, 52,000 pounds.  The slaughter trade\r\nhas increased, but not so much as the butter.  Price of butter now at\r\nWaterford, 58s.; twenty years' average, 42s.  Beef now to 25s.; average,\r\ntwenty years, 10s. to 18s.  Pork, now 30s.; average, twenty years, 16s.\r\nto 22s.  Eighty sail of ships now belonging to the port, twenty years ago\r\nnot thirty.  They pay to the captains of ship of two hundred tons 5\r\npounds a month; the mate 3 pounds 10s.  Ten men at 40s., five years ago\r\nonly 27s.  Building ships, 10 pounds a ton.  Wear and tear of such a\r\nship, 20 pounds a month.  Ship provisions, 20s. a month.\r\n\r\nThe new church in this city is a very beautiful one; the body of it is in\r\nthe same style exactly as that of Belfast, already described: the total\r\nlength one hundred and seventy feet, the breadth fifty-eight.  The length\r\nof the body of the church ninety-two, the height forty; breadth between\r\nthe pillars, twenty-six.  The aisle (which I do not remember at Belfast)\r\nis fifty-eight by forty-five.  A room on one side the steeple, space for\r\nthe bishop's court, twenty-four by eighteen; on the other side, a room of\r\nthe same size for the vestry; and twenty-eight feet square left for a\r\nsteeple when their funds will permit.  The whole is light and beautiful.\r\nIt was built by subscription, and there is a fine organ bespoke at\r\nLondon.  But the finest object in this city is the quay, which is\r\nunrivalled by any I have seen.  It is an English mile long; the buildings\r\non it are only common houses, but the river is near a mile over, flows up\r\nto the town in one noble reach, and the opposite shore a bold hill, which\r\nrises immediately from the water to a height that renders the whole\r\nmagnificent.  This is scattered with some wood, and divided into pastures\r\nof a beautiful verdure by hedges.  I crossed the water, in order to walk\r\nup the rocks on the top of this hill.  In one place, over against\r\nBilberry quarry, you look immediately down on the river, which flows in\r\nnoble reaches from Granny Castle on the right past Cromwell's rock, the\r\nshores on both sides quite steep, especially the rock of Bilberry.  You\r\nlook over the whole town, which here appears in a triangular form.\r\nBesides the city the Cummeragh mountains, Slein-a-man, etc., come in\r\nview.  Kilmacow river falls into the Suir, after flowing through a large\r\nextent of well-planted country.  This is the finest view about the city.\r\n\r\nFrom Waterford to Passage, and got my chaise and horses on board the\r\n_Countess of Tyrone_ packet, in full expectation of sailing immediately,\r\nas the wind was fair, but I soon found the difference of these private\r\nvessels and the Post-Office packets at Holyhead and Dublin.  When the\r\nwind was fair the tide was foul; and when the tide was with them the wind\r\nwould not do.  In English, there was not a complement of passengers, and\r\nso I had the agreeableness of waiting with my horses in the hold, by way\r\nof rest, after a journey of above one thousand five hundred miles.\r\n\r\nOctober 18.  After a beastly night passed on shipboard, and finding no\r\nsigns of departure, walked to Ballycanvan, the seat of Cornelius Bolton,\r\nEsq.; rode with Mr. Bolton, jun., to Faithleghill, which commands one of\r\nthe finest views I have seen in Ireland.  There is a rock on the top of a\r\nhill which has a very bold view on every side down on a great extent of\r\ncountry, much of which is grass inclosures of a good verdure.  This hill\r\nis the centre of a circle of about ten miles diameter, beyond which\r\nhigher lands rise, which, after spreading to a great extent, have on\r\nevery side a background of mountain: in a northerly direction Mount\r\nLeinster, between Wexford and Wicklow, twenty-six miles off, rises in\r\nseveral heads far above the clouds.  A little to the right of this,\r\nSliakeiltha (_i.e._ \"the woody mountain\"), at a less distance, is a fine\r\nobject.  To the left, Tory Hill, only five miles, in a regular form,\r\nvaries the outline.  To the east, there is the Long Mountain, eighteen\r\nmiles distant, and several lesser Wexford hills.  To the south-east, the\r\nSaltees.  To the south, the ocean, and the Colines about the bay of\r\nTramore.  To the west, Monavollagh rises two thousand one hundred and\r\nsixty feet above the level of the sea, eighteen miles off, being part of\r\nthe great range of the Cummeragh mountains: and to the north-west\r\nSlein-a-man, at the distance of twenty-four miles; so that the outline is\r\neverywhere bold and distinct, though distant.  These circumstances would\r\nalone form a great view, but the water part of it, which fills up the\r\ncanvas, is in a much superior style.  The great river Suir takes a\r\nwinding course from the city of Waterford, through a rich country,\r\nhanging on the sides of hills to its banks, and, dividing into a double\r\nchannel, forms the lesser island, both of which courses you command\r\ndistinctly.  United, it makes a bold reach under the hill on which you\r\nstand, and there receives the noble tribute of the united waters of the\r\nBarrow and Nore in two great channels, which form the larger island.\r\nEnlarged by such an accession of water, it winds round the hill in a\r\nbending course, of the freest and most graceful outline, everywhere from\r\none to three miles across, with bold shores that give a sharp outline to\r\nits course to the ocean.  Twenty sail of ships at Passage gave animation\r\nto the scene.  Upon the whole, the boldness of the mountain outline, the\r\nvariety of the grounds, the vast extent of river, with the declivity to\r\nit from the point of view, altogether form so unrivalled a scenery, every\r\nobject so commanding, that the general want of wood is almost forgotten.\r\n\r\nTwo years after this account was written I again visited this enchanting\r\nhill, and walked to it, day after day, from Ballycanvan, and with\r\nincreasing pleasure.  Mr. Bolton, jun., has, since I was there before,\r\ninclosed forty acres on the top and steep slope to the water, and begun\r\nto plant them.  This will be a prodigious addition; for the slope forming\r\nthe bold shore for a considerable space, and having projections from\r\nwhich the wood will all be seen in the gentle hollows of the hill, the\r\neffect will be amazingly fine.  Walks and a riding are tracing out, which\r\nwill command fresh beauties at every step.  The spots from which a\r\nvariety of beautiful views are seen are numerous.  All the way from\r\nBallycanvan to Faithleg, the whole, to the amount of one thousand two\r\nhundred acres, is the property of Mr. Bolton.\r\n\r\nFarms about Ballycanvan, Waterford, etc., are generally small, from\r\ntwenty and thirty to five hundred acres, generally about two hundred and\r\nfifty.  All above two hundred acres are in general dairies; some of the\r\ndairy ones rise very high.  The soil is a reddish stony or slaty gravel,\r\ndry, except low lands, which are clay or turf.  Rents vary much--about\r\nthe town very high, from 5 pounds 5s. to 9 pounds, but at the distance of\r\na few miles towards Passage, etc., they are from 20s. to 40s., and some\r\nhigher, but the country in general does not rise so high, usually 10s. to\r\n20s. for dairying land.\r\n\r\nThe poor people spin their own flax, but not more, and a few of them wool\r\nfor themselves.  Their food is potatoes and milk; but they have a\r\nconsiderable assistance from fish, particularly herrings; part of the\r\nyear they have also barley, oaten, and rye bread.  They are incomparably\r\nbetter off in every respect than twenty years ago.  Their increase about\r\nBallycanvan is very great, and tillage all over this neighbourhood is\r\nincreased.  The rent of a cabin 10s.; an acre with it 20s.  The grass of\r\na cow a few years ago 20s., now 25s. or 30s.\r\n\r\nAn exceeding good practice here in making their fences is, they plant the\r\nquick on the side of the bank in the common manner, and then, instead of\r\nthe dead hedge we use in England on the top of the bank, they plant a row\r\nof old thorns, two or three feet high, which readily grow, and form at\r\nonce a most excellent fence.  Their way also of taking in sand-banks from\r\nthe river deserves notice.  They stake down a row of furzes at low water,\r\nlaying stones on them to the height of one or two feet; these retain the\r\nmud, which every tide brings in, so as to fill up all within the furze as\r\nhigh as their tops.  I remarked, on the strand, that a few boatloads of\r\nstones laid carelessly had had this effect, for within them I measured\r\ntwelve inches deep of rich blue mud left behind them, the same as they\r\nuse in manuring, full of shells, and effervesced strongly with vinegar.\r\n\r\nAmong the poor people the fishermen are in much the best circumstances.\r\nThe fishery is considerable; Waterford and its harbour have fifty boats\r\neach, from eight to twelve tons, six men on an average to each, but to\r\none of six tons five men go.  A boat of eight tons costs 40 pounds; one\r\nof twelve, 60 pounds.  To each boat there is a train of nets of six pair,\r\nwhich costs from 4 pounds 4s. to 6 pounds 6s.; tan them with bark.  Their\r\nonly net fishery is that of herrings, which is commonly carried on by\r\nshares.  The division of the fish is, first, one-fourth for the boat; and\r\nthen the men and nets divide the rest, the latter reckoned as three men.\r\nThey reckon ten maze of herrings an indifferent night's work; when there\r\nis a good take, forty maze have been taken, twenty a good night; the\r\nprice per maze from 1s. to 7s., average 5s.  Their take in 1775, the\r\ngreatest they have known, when they had more than they could dispose of,\r\nand the whole town and country stunk of them, they retailed them\r\nthirty-two for a penny; 1773 and 1774 good years.  They barrelled many,\r\nbut in general there is an import of Swedish.  Besides the common\r\narticles I have registered, the following are: pigeons, 1s. a couple; a\r\nhare, 1s.; partridges, 9d.; turbots, fine ones, 4s. to 10s.; soles a\r\npair, large, 1s. 6d to 1s.; lobsters, 3d. each; oysters, 6s. per hundred;\r\nrabbits, 1s. to 1s. 4d. a couple; cod, 1s. each, large; salmon, 1.25d. to\r\n2d.\r\n\r\nA very extraordinary circumstance I was told--that within five or six\r\nyears there has been much hay carried from Waterford to Norway, in the\r\nNorway ships that bring deals.  As hay is dear here, it proves a most\r\nbackward state of husbandry in that northerly region, since the\r\nneighbourhood of sea-ports to which this hay can alone go is generally\r\nthe best improved in all countries.\r\n\r\nOctober 19, the wind being fair, took my leave of Mr. Bolton, and went\r\nback to the ship.  Met with a fresh scene of provoking delays, so that it\r\nwas the next morning, October 20, at eight o'clock, before we sailed, and\r\nthen it was not wind, but a cargo of passengers that spread our sails.\r\nTwelve or fourteen hours are not an uncommon passage, but such was our\r\nluck that, after being in sight of the lights on the Smalls, we were by\r\ncontrary winds blown opposite to Arklow sands.  A violent gale arose,\r\nwhich presently blew a storm that lasted thirty-six hours, in which,\r\nunder a reefed mainsail, the ship drifted up and down wearing in order to\r\nkeep clear of the coasts.\r\n\r\nNo wonder this appeared to me, a fresh-water sailor, as a storm, when the\r\noldest men on board reckoned it a violent one.  The wind blew in furious\r\ngusts; the waves ran very high; the cabin windows burst open, and the sea\r\npouring in set everything afloat, and among the rest a poor lady, who had\r\nspread her bed on the floor.  We had, however, the satisfaction to find,\r\nby trying the pumps every watch, that the ship made little water.  I had\r\nmore time to attend these circumstances than the rest of the passengers,\r\nbeing the only one in seven who escaped without being sick.  It pleased\r\nGod to preserve us, but we did not cast anchor in Milford Haven till\r\nTuesday morning, the 22nd, at one o'clock.\r\n\r\nIt is much to be wished that there were some means of being secure of\r\npackets sailing regularly, instead of waiting till there is such a number\r\nof passengers as satisfies the owner and captain.  With the Post-Office\r\npackets there is this satisfaction, and a great one it is.  The contrary\r\nconduct is so perfectly detestable that I should suppose the scheme of\r\nWaterford ones can never succeed.\r\n\r\nTwo years after, having been assured this conveyance was put on a new\r\nfooting, I ventured to try it again, but was mortified to find that the\r\n_Tyrone_, the only one that could take a chaise or horses (the _Countess_\r\nbeing laid up), was repairing, but would sail in five days.  I waited,\r\nand received assurance after assurance that she would be ready on such a\r\nday, and then on another.  In a word, I waited twenty-four days before I\r\nsailed.  Moderately speaking, I could by Dublin have reached Turin or\r\nMilan as soon as I did Milford in this conveyance.  All this time the\r\npapers had constant advertisements of the _Tyrone_ sailing regularly,\r\ninstead of letting the public know that she was under a repair.  Her\r\nowner seems to be a fair and worthy man; he will therefore probably give\r\nup the scheme entirely, unless assisted by the corporation with at least\r\nfour ships more, to sail regularly with or without passengers.  At\r\npresent it is a general disappointment.  I was fortunate in Mr. Bolton's\r\nacquaintance, passing my time very agreeably at his hospitable mansion;\r\nbut those who, in such a case, should find a Waterford inn their\r\nresource, would curse the _Tyrone_, and set off for Dublin.  The expenses\r\nof this passage are higher than those from Dublin to Holyhead: I paid--\r\n\r\n                                                       l.  s. d.\r\nA four-wheel chaise                                    3  3  0\r\nThree horses                                           3  3  0\r\nSelf                                                   1  1  0\r\nTwo servants                                           1  1  0\r\nCustom-house at Waterford, hay, oats, etc.             2  1  7\r\nDitto at Pembroke and Hubberston                       3  0  0\r\nSailors, boats, and sundry small charges               1 15  5\r\n                                                       15  5  0\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\n1777.  Upon a second journey to Ireland this year, I took the opportunity\r\nof going from Dublin to Mitchelstown, by a route through the central part\r\nof the kingdom, which I had not before sufficiently viewed.\r\n\r\nLeft Dublin the 24th of September, and taking the road to Naas, I was\r\nagain struck with the great population of the country, the cabins being\r\nso much poorer in the vicinity of the capital than in the more distant\r\nparts of the kingdom.\r\n\r\nTo Kildare, crossing the Curragh, so famous for its turf.  It is a\r\nsheep-walk of above four thousand English acres, forming a more beautiful\r\nlawn than the hand of art ever made.  Nothing can exceed the extreme\r\nsoftness of the turf, which is of a verdure that charms the eye, and\r\nhighly set off by the gentle inequality of surface.  The soil is a fine\r\ndry loam on a stony bottom; it is fed by many large flocks, turned on it\r\nby the occupiers of the adjacent farms, who alone have the right, and pay\r\nvery great rents on that account.  It is the only considerable common in\r\nthe kingdom.  The sheep yield very little wool, not more than 3lb. per\r\nfleece, but of a very fine quality.\r\n\r\nFrom Furness to Shaen Castle, in the Queen's County, Dean Coote's; but as\r\nthe husbandry, etc., of this neighbourhood is already registered, I have\r\nonly to observe that Mr. Coote was so kind as to show me the improved\r\ngrounds of Dawson's Court, the seat of Lord Carlow, which I had not seen\r\nbefore.  The principal beauties of the place are the well-grown and\r\nextensive plantations, which form a shade not often met with in Ireland.\r\nThere is in the backgrounds a lake well accompanied with wood, broken by\r\nseveral islands that are covered with underwood, and an ornamented walk\r\npassing on the banks which leads from the house.  This lake is in the\r\nseason perfectly alive with wild-fowl.  Near it is a very beautiful spot,\r\nwhich commands a view of both woods and water; a situation either for a\r\nhouse or a temple.  Mr. Dawson is adding to the plantations, an\r\nemployment of all others the most meritorious in Ireland.  Another work,\r\nscarcely less so, was the erecting a large handsome inn, wherein the same\r\ngentleman intends establishing a person who shall be able to supply\r\ntravellers post with either chaises or horses.\r\n\r\nFrom Shaen Castle to Gloster, in the King's County, the seat of John\r\nLloyd, Esq., member for that county, to whose attention I owe the\r\nfollowing particulars, in which he took every means to have me well and\r\naccurately informed.  But first let me observe that I was much pleased to\r\nremark, all the way from Naas quite to Rosscrea, that the country was\r\namongst the finest I had seen in Ireland, and consequently that I was\r\nfortunate in having an opportunity of seeing it after the involuntary\r\nomission of last year.  The cabins, though many of them are very bad, yet\r\nare better than in some other counties, and chimneys generally a part of\r\nthem.  The people, too, have no very miserable appearance; the breed of\r\ncattle and sheep good, and the hogs much the best I have anywhere seen in\r\nIreland.  Turf is everywhere at hand, and in plenty; yet are the bogs not\r\nso general as to affect the beauty of the country, which is very great in\r\nmany tracts, with a scattering of wood, which makes it pleasing.  Shaen\r\nCastle stands in the midst of a very fine tract.  From Mountrath to\r\nGloster, Mr. Lloyd's, I could have imagined myself in a very pleasing\r\npart of England.  The country breaks into a variety of inequalities of\r\nhill and dale; it is all well inclosed with fine hedges; there is a\r\nplenty of wood, not so monopolised as in many parts of the kingdom by\r\nhere and there a solitary seat, but spread over the whole face of the\r\nprospect: look which way you will, it is cultivated and cheerful.\r\n\r\nThe Shannon adds not a little to the convenience and agreeableness of a\r\nresidence so near it.  Besides affording these sorts of wild-fowl, the\r\nquantity and size of its fish are amazing: pikes swarm in it, and rise in\r\nweight to fifty pounds.  In the little flat spaces on its banks are small\r\nbut deep lochs, which are covered in winter and in floods.  When the\r\nriver withdraws, it leaves plenty of fish in them, which are caught to\r\nput into stews.  Mr. Holmes has a small one before his door at Johnstown,\r\nwith a little stream which feeds it.  A trowling-rod here gets you a bite\r\nin a moment, of a pike from twenty to forty pounds.  I ate of one of\r\ntwenty-seven pounds so taken.  I had also the pleasure of seeing a\r\nfisherman bring three trout, weighing fourteen pounds, and sell them for\r\nsixpence-halfpenny a piece.  A couple of boats lying at anchor, with\r\nlines extended from one to the other, and hooks in plenty from them, have\r\nbeen known to catch an incredible quantity of trout.  Colonel Prittie, in\r\none morning, caught four stone odd pounds, thirty-two trout.  In general\r\nthey rise from three to nine pounds.  Perch swarm; they appeared in the\r\nShannon for the first time about ten years ago, in such plenty that the\r\npoor lived on them.  Bream of six pounds; eels very plentiful.  There are\r\nmany gillaroos in the river; one of twelve pounds weight was sent to Mr.\r\nJenkinson.  Upon the whole, these circumstances, with the pleasure of\r\nshooting and boating on the river, added to the glorious view it yields,\r\nand which is enough at any time to cheer the mind, render this\r\nneighbourhood one of the most enviable situations to live in that I have\r\nseen in Ireland.  The face of the country gives every circumstance of\r\nbeauty.  From Killodeernan Hill, behind the new house building by Mr.\r\nHolmes, the whole is seen to great advantage.  The spreading part of the\r\nShannon, called Loch Derg, is commanded distinctly for many miles.  It is\r\nin two grand divisions of great variety: that to the north is a reach of\r\nfive miles leading to Portumna.  The whole hither shore a scenery of\r\nhills, checkered by enclosures and little woods, and retiring from the\r\neye into a rich distant prospect.  The woods of Doras, belonging to Lord\r\nClanricarde, form a part of the opposite shore, and the river itself\r\npresents an island of one hundred and twenty acres.  Inclining to the\r\nleft, a vale of rough ground, with an old castle in it, is backed by a\r\nbold hill, which intercepts the river there, and then the great reach of\r\nfifteen miles, the bay of Sheriff, spreads to the eye, with a\r\nmagnificence not a little added to by the boundary, a sharp outline of\r\nthe county of Clare mountains, between which and the Duharrow hills the\r\nShannon finds its way.  These hills lead the eye still more to the left,\r\ntill the Keeper meets it, presenting a very beautiful outline that sinks\r\ninto other ranges of hill, uniting with the Devil's Bit.  The home\r\nscenery of the grounds, woods, hills, and lake of Johnstown, is\r\nbeautiful.\r\n\r\nDancing is very general among the poor people, almost universal in every\r\ncabin.  Dancing-masters of their own rank travel through the country from\r\ncabin to cabin, with a piper or blind fiddler, and the pay is sixpence a\r\nquarter.  It is an absolute system of education.  Weddings are always\r\ncelebrated with much dancing, and a Sunday rarely passes without a dance.\r\nThere are very few among them who will not, after a hard day's work,\r\ngladly walk seven miles to have a dance.  John is not so lively, but then\r\na hard day's work with him is certainly a different affair from what it\r\nis with Paddy.  Other branches of education are likewise much attended\r\nto, every child of the poorest family learning to read, write, and cast\r\naccounts.\r\n\r\nThere is a very ancient custom here, for a number of country neighbours\r\namong the poor people to fix upon some young woman that ought, as they\r\nthink, to be married.  They also agree upon a young fellow as a proper\r\nhusband for her.  This determined, they send to the fair one's cabin to\r\ninform her that on the Sunday following \"she is to be horsed,\" that is,\r\ncarried on men's backs.  She must then provide whisky and cider for a\r\ntreat, as all will pay her a visit after mass for a hurling match.  As\r\nsoon as she is horsed, the hurling begins, in which the young fellow\r\nappointed for her husband has the eyes of all the company fixed on him.\r\nIf he comes off conqueror, he is certainly married to the girl; but if\r\nanother is victorious, he as certainly loses her, for she is the prize of\r\nthe victor.  These trials are not always finished in one Sunday; they\r\ntake sometimes two or three, and the common expression when they are over\r\nis, that \"such a girl was goaled.\"  Sometimes one barony hurls against\r\nanother, but a marriageable girl is always the prize.  Hurling is a sort\r\nof cricket, but instead of throwing the ball in order to knock down a\r\nwicket, the aim is to pass it through a bent stick, the end stuck in the\r\nground.  In these matches they perform such feats of activity as ought to\r\nevidence the food they live on to be far from deficient in nourishment.\r\n\r\nIn the hills above Derry are some very fine slate quarries, that employ\r\nsixty men.  The quarrymen are paid 3s. a thousand for the slates, and the\r\nlabourers 5d. a day.  They are very fine, and sent by the Shannon to\r\ndistant parts of the kingdom; the price at the quarry 6s. a thousand, and\r\nat the shore 6s. 8d.  Four hundred thousand slates are raised to pay the\r\nrent only, from which some estimate may be made of the quantity.\r\n\r\nMr. Head has a practice in his fences which deserves universal imitation;\r\nit is planting trees for gate-posts.  Stone piers are expensive, and\r\nalways tumbling down; trees are beautiful, and never want repairing.\r\nWithin fifteen years this gentleman has improved Derry so much, that\r\nthose who had only seen it before would find it almost a new creation.\r\nHe has built a handsome stone house, on the slope of a hill rising from\r\nthe Shannon, and backed by some fine woods, which unite with many old\r\nhedges well planted to form a woodland scene beautiful in the contrast to\r\nthe bright expanse of the noble river below.  The declivity on which\r\nthese woods are finishes in a mountain, which rises above the whole.  The\r\nShannon gives a bend around the adjoining lands, so as to be seen from\r\nthe house both to the west and north, the lawn falling gradually to a\r\nmargin of wood on the shore, which varies the outline.  The river is two\r\nmiles broad, and on the opposite shore cultivated inclosures rise in some\r\nplaces almost to the mountain top, which is very bold.\r\n\r\nIt is a very singular demesne; a stripe of very beautiful ground,\r\nreaching two miles along the banks of the river, which forms his fence on\r\none side, with a wall on the other.  There is so much wood as to render\r\nit very pleasing; adding to every day by planting all the fences made or\r\nrepaired.  From several little hills, which rise in different parts of\r\nit, extensive views of the river are commanded quite to Portumna; but\r\nthese are much eclipsed by that from the top of the hill above the slate\r\nquarry.  From thence you see the river for at least forty miles, from\r\nPortumna to twenty miles beyond Limerick.  It has the appearance of a\r\nfine basin, two miles over, into which three great rivers lead, being the\r\nnorth and south course and the Bay of Sheriff.  The reaches of it one\r\nbeyond another to Portumna are fine.  At the foot of the mountain Mr.\r\nHead's demesne extends in a shore of rich woodland.\r\n\r\nOctober 7.  Took my leave of Mr. Head, after passing four days very\r\nagreeably.  Through Killaloe, over the Shannon, a very long bridge of\r\nmany arches; went out of the road to see a fall of that river at Castle\r\nConnel, where there is such an accompaniment of wood as to form a very\r\npleasing scenery.  The river takes a very rapid rocky course around a\r\nprojecting rock, on which a gentleman has built a summer-house, and\r\nformed a terrace: it is a striking spot.  To Limerick.  Laid at Bennis's,\r\nthe first inn we had slept in from Dublin.  God preserve us this journey\r\nfrom another!\r\n\r\nIt is not uncommon, especially in mountainous countries, to find objects\r\nthat much deserve the attention of travellers entirely neglected by them.\r\nThere are a few instances of this upon Lord Kingsborough's estate, in the\r\nneighbourhood of Mitchelstown.  The first I shall mention is a cave at\r\nSkeheenrinky, on the road between Cahir and that place.  The opening to\r\nit is a cleft of rock in a limestone hill, so narrow as to be difficult\r\nto get into it.  I descended by a ladder of about twenty steps, and then\r\nfound myself in a vault of a hundred feet long, and fifty or sixty high.\r\nA small hole on the left leads from this a winding course of I believe\r\nnot less than half an Irish mile, exhibiting a variety that struck me\r\nmuch.  In some places the cavity in the rock is so large that when well\r\nlighted up by candles (not flambeaux; Lord Kingsborough once showed it me\r\nwith them, and we found their smoke troublesome) it takes the appearance\r\nof a vaulted cathedral, supported by massy columns.  The walls, ceiling,\r\nfloor, and pillars, are by turns composed of every fantastic form; and\r\noften of very beautiful incrustations of spar, some of which glitters so\r\nmuch that it seems powdered with diamonds; and in others the ceiling is\r\nformed of that sort which has so near a resemblance to a cauliflower.\r\nThe spar formed into columns by the dropping of water has taken some very\r\nregular forms; but others are different, folded in plaits of light\r\ndrapery, which hang from their support in a very pleasing manner.  The\r\nangles of the walls seem fringed with icicles.  One very long branch of\r\nthe cave, which turns to the north, is in some places so narrow and low,\r\nthat one crawls into it, when it suddenly breaks into large vaulted\r\nspaces, in a thousand forms.  The spar in all this cave is very\r\nbrilliant, and almost equal to Bristol stone.  For several hundred yards\r\nin the larger branch there is a deep water at the bottom of the declivity\r\nto the right, which the common people call the river.  A part of the way\r\nis over a sort of potter's clay, which moulds into any form, and is of a\r\nbrown colour; a very different soil from any in the neighbouring country.\r\nI have seen the famous cave in the Peak, but think it very much inferior\r\nto this; and Lord Kingsborough, who has viewed the Grot d'Aucel in\r\nBurgundy, says that it is not to be compared with it.\r\n\r\nBut the commanding region of the Galtees deserves more attention.  Those\r\nwho are fond of scenes in which Nature reigns in all her wild\r\nmagnificence should visit this stupendous chain.  It consists of many\r\nvast mountains, thrown together in an assemblage of the most interesting\r\nfeatures, from the boldness and height of the declivities, freedom of\r\noutline, and variety of parts, filling a space of about six miles by\r\nthree or four.  Galtymore is the highest point, and rises like the lord\r\nand father of the surrounding progeny.  From the top you look down upon a\r\ngreat extent of mountain, which shelves away from him to the south, east,\r\nand west; but to the north the ridge is almost a perpendicular declivity.\r\nOn that side the famous golden vale of Limerick and Tipperary spreads a\r\nrich level to the eye, bounded by the mountains of Clare, King's and\r\nQueen's Counties, with the course of the Shannon, for many miles below\r\nLimerick.  To the south you look over alternate ridges of mountains,\r\nwhich rise one beyond another, till in a clear day the eye meets the\r\nocean near Dungarvan.  The mountains of Waterford and Knockmealdown fill\r\nup the space to the south-east.  The western is the most extensive view;\r\nfor nothing stops the eye till Mangerton and Macgillicuddy Reeks point\r\nout the spot where Killarney's lake calls for a farther excursion.  The\r\nprospect extends into eight counties--Cork, Kerry, Waterford, Limerick,\r\nClare, Queen's, Tipperary, King's.\r\n\r\nA little to the west of this proud summit, below it in a very\r\nextraordinary hollow, is a circular lake of two acres, reported to be\r\nunfathomable.  The descriptions which I have read of the craters of\r\nexhausted volcanoes leave very little doubt of this being one; and the\r\nconical regularity of the summit of Galtymore speaks the same language.\r\nEast of this respectable hill, to use Sir William Hamilton's language, is\r\na declivity of about one-quarter of a mile, and there Galtybeg rises in a\r\nyet more regular cone; and between the two hills is another lake, which\r\nfrom its position seems to have been once the crater which threw up\r\nGaltybeg, as the first mentioned was the origin of Galtymore.  Beyond the\r\nformer hill is a third lake, and east of that another hill; I was told of\r\na fourth, with another corresponding mountain.  It is only the mere\r\nsummits of these mountains which rise above the lakes.  Speaking of them\r\nbelow, they may be said to be on the tops of the hills.  They are all of\r\nthem at the bottom of an almost regularly circular hollow.  On the side\r\nnext the mountain-top are walls of perpendicular rocks, in regular\r\nstrata, and some of them piled on each other, with an appearance of art\r\nrather than nature.  In these rocks the eagles, which are seen in numbers\r\non the Galtees, have their nests.  Supposing the mountains to be of\r\nvolcanic origin, and these lakes the craters, of which I have not a\r\ndoubt, they are objects of the greatest curiosity, for there is an\r\nunusual regularity in every considerable summit having its corresponding\r\ncrater.  But without this circumstance, the scenery is interesting in a\r\nvery great degree.  The mountain summits, which are often wrapped in the\r\nclouds, at other times exhibit the freest outline; the immense scooped\r\nhollows which sink at your feet, declivities of so vast a depth as to\r\ngive one terror to look down; with the unusual forms of the lower region\r\nof hills, particularly Bull Hill, and Round Hill, each a mile over, yet\r\nrising out of circular vales, with the regularity of semi-globes, unite\r\nupon the whole to exhibit a scenery to the eye in which the parts are of\r\na magnitude so commanding, a character so interesting, and a variety so\r\nstriking, that they well deserve to be examined by every curious\r\ntraveller.\r\n\r\nNor are these immense outlines the whole of what is to be seen in this\r\ngreat range of mountains.  Every glen has its beauties: there is a\r\nconsiderable mountain river, or rather torrent, in every one of them; but\r\nthe greatest are the Funcheon, between Sefang and Galtymore; the\r\nLimestone river, between Galtymore and Round Hill, and the Grouse river,\r\nbetween Coolegarranroe and Mr. O'Callaghan's mountain; these present to\r\nthe eye, for a tract of about three miles, every variety that rock,\r\nwater, and mountain can give, thrown into all the fantastic forms which\r\nart may attempt in ornamented grounds, but always fails in.  Nothing can\r\nexceed the beauty of the water, when not discoloured by rain; its lucid\r\ntransparency shows, at considerable depths, every pebble no bigger than a\r\npin, every rocky basin alive with trout and eels, that play and dash\r\namong the rocks as if endowed with that native vigour which animates, in\r\na superior degree, every inhabitant of the mountains, from the bounding\r\nred deer and the soaring eagle down even to the fishes of the brook.\r\nEvery five minutes you have a water-fall in these glens, which in any\r\nother region would stop every traveller to admire it.  Sometimes the vale\r\ntakes a gentle declivity, and presents to the eye at one stroke twenty or\r\nthirty falls, which render the scenery all alive with motion; the rocks\r\nare tossed about in the wildest confusion, and the torrent bursts by\r\nturns from above, beneath, and under them; while the background is always\r\nfilled up with the mountains which stretch around.\r\n\r\nIn the western glen is the finest cascade in all the Galtees.  There are\r\ntwo falls, with a basin in the rock between, but from some points of view\r\nthey appear one: the rock over which the water tumbles is about sixty\r\nfeet high.  A good line in which to view these objects is either to take\r\nthe Killarney and Mallow road to Mitchelstown and from thence by Lord\r\nKingsborough's new one to Skeheenrinky, there to take one of the glens to\r\nGaltybeg and Galtymore, and return to Mitchelstown by the Wolf's Track,\r\nTemple Hill, and the Waterfall; or, if the Cork road is travelling, to\r\nmake Dobbin's inn, at Ballyporeen, the head-quarters, and view them from\r\nthence.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\nHaving heard much of the beauties of a part of the Queen's County I had\r\nnot before seen, I took that line of country in my way on a journey to\r\nDublin.\r\n\r\nFrom Mitchelstown to Cashel, the road leads as far as Galbally in the\r\nroute already travelled from Cullen.  Towards Cashel the country is\r\nvarious.  The only objects deserving attention are the plantations of\r\nThomastown, the seat of Francis Mathew, Esq.; they consist chiefly of\r\nhedgerow trees in double and treble rows, are well grown, and of such\r\nextent as to form an uncommon woodland scene in Ireland.  Found the widow\r\nHolland's inn, at Cashel, clean and very civil.  Take the road to\r\nUrlingford.  The rich sheep pastures, part of the famous golden vale,\r\nreach between three and four miles from Cashel to the great bog by Botany\r\nHill, noted for producing a greater variety of plants than common.  That\r\nbog is separated by only small tracts of land from the string of bogs\r\nwhich extend through the Queen's County, from the great bog of Allen; it\r\nis here of considerable extent, and exceedingly improvable.  Then enter a\r\nlow marshy bad country, which grows worse after passing the sixty-sixth\r\nmilestone, and successive bogs in it.  Breakfast at Johnstown, a regular\r\nvillage on a slight eminence, built by Mr. Hayley.  It is near the spa of\r\nBallyspellin.\r\n\r\nRows of trees are planted, but their heads all cut off, I suppose from\r\ntheir not thriving, being planted too old.  Immediately on leaving these\r\nplanted avenues, enter a row of eight or ten new cabins, at a distance\r\nfrom each other, which appear to be a new undertaking, the land about\r\nthem all pared and burnt, and the ashes in heaps.\r\n\r\nEnter a fine planted country, with much corn and good thriving quick\r\nhedges for many miles.  The road leads through a large wood, which joins\r\nLord Ashbrook's plantations, whose house is situated in the midst of more\r\nwood than almost any one I have seen in Ireland.  Pass Durrow; the\r\ncountry for two or three miles continues all inclosed with fine quick\r\nhedges, is beautiful, and has some resemblance to the best parts of\r\nEssex.  Sir Robert Staple's improvements join this fine tract.  They are\r\ncompleted in a most perfect manner, the hedges well grown, cut, and in\r\nsuch excellent order that I can scarcely believe myself to be in Ireland.\r\nHis gates are all of iron.  These sylvan scenes continue through other\r\nseats, beautifully situated amidst gentle declivities of the finest\r\nverdure, full-grown woods, excellent hedges, and a pretty river winding\r\nby the house.  The whole environs of several would be admired in the best\r\nparts of England.\r\n\r\nCross a great bog, within sight of Lord de Vesci's plantations.  The road\r\nleads over it, being drained for that purpose by deep cuts on either\r\nside.  I should apprehend this bog to be among the most improvable in the\r\ncountry.  Slept at Ballyroan, at an inn kept by three animals who call\r\nthemselves women; met with more impertinence than at any other in\r\nIreland.  It is an execrable hole.  In three or four miles pass Sir John\r\nParnel's, prettily situated in a neatly dressed lawn, with much wood\r\nabout it, and a lake quite alive with wild fowl.\r\n\r\nPass Monstereven, and cross directly a large bog, drained and partly\r\nimproved; but all of it bearing grass, and seems in a state that might\r\neasily be reduced to rich meadow, with only a dressing of lime.  Here I\r\ngot again into the road I had travelled before.\r\n\r\nI must in general remark, that from near Urlingford to Dawson Court, near\r\nMonstereven, which is completely across the Queen's County, is a line of\r\nabove thirty English miles, and is for that extent by much the most\r\nimproved of any I have seen in Ireland.  It is generally well planted,\r\nhas many woods, and not consisting of patches of plantation just by\r\ngentlemen's houses, but spreading over the whole face of the country, so\r\nas to give it the richness of an English woodland scene.  What a country\r\nwould Ireland be had the inhabitants of the rest of it improved the whole\r\nlike this!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION I.--Soil, Face of the Country, and Climate.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo judge of Ireland by the conversation one sometimes hears in England,\r\nit would be supposed that one-half of it was covered with bogs, and the\r\nother with mountains filled with Irish ready to fly at the sight of a\r\ncivilised being.  There are people who will smile when they hear that, in\r\nproportion to the size of the two countries, Ireland is more cultivated\r\nthan England, having much less waste land of all sorts.  Of uncultivated\r\nmountains there are no such tracts as are found in our four northern\r\ncounties, and the North Riding of Yorkshire, with the eastern line of\r\nLancaster, nearly down to the Peak of Derby, which form an extent of\r\nabove a hundred miles of waste.  The most considerable of this sort in\r\nIreland are in Kerry, Galway, and Mayo, and some in Sligo and Donegal.\r\nBut all these together will not make the quantity we have in the four\r\nnorthern counties; the valleys in the Irish mountains are also more\r\ninhabited, I think, than those of England, except where there are mines,\r\nand consequently some sort of cultivation creeping up the sides.  Natural\r\nfertility, acre for acre over the two kingdoms, is certainly in favour of\r\nIreland; of this I believe there can scarcely be a doubt entertained,\r\nwhen it is considered that some of the more beautiful, and even best\r\ncultivated counties in England, owe almost everything to the capital,\r\nart, and industry of the inhabitants.\r\n\r\nThe circumstance which strikes me as the greatest singularity of Ireland\r\nis the rockiness of the soil, which should seem at first sight against\r\nthat degree of fertility; but the contrary is the fact.  Stone is so\r\ngeneral, that I have great reason to believe the whole island is one vast\r\nrock of different strata and kinds rising out of the sea.  I have rarely\r\nheard of any great depths being sunk without meeting with it.  In general\r\nit appears on the surface in every part of the kingdom; the flattest and\r\nmost fertile parts, as Limerick, Tipperary, and Meath, have it at no\r\ngreat depth, almost as much as the more barren ones.  May we not\r\nrecognise in this the hand of bounteous Providence, which has given\r\nperhaps the most stony soil in Europe to the moistest climate in it?  If\r\nas much rain fell upon the clays of England (a soil very rarely met with\r\nin Ireland, and never without much stone) as falls upon the rocks of her\r\nsister island, those lands could not be cultivated.  But the rocks are\r\nhere clothed with verdure; those of limestone, with only a thin covering\r\nof mould, have the softest and most beautiful turf imaginable.\r\n\r\nOf the great advantages resulting from the general plenty of limestone\r\nand limestone gravel, and the nature of the bogs, I shall have occasion\r\nto speak more particularly hereafter.\r\n\r\nThe rockiness of the soil in Ireland is so universal that it predominates\r\nin every sort.  One cannot use with propriety the terms clay, loam, sand,\r\netc.; it must be a stony clay, a stony loam, a gravelly sand.  Clay,\r\nespecially the yellow, is much talked of in Ireland, but it is for want\r\nof proper discrimination.  I have once or twice seen almost a pure clay\r\nupon the surface, but it is extremely rare.  The true yellow clay is\r\nusually found in a thin stratum under the surface mould, and over a rock;\r\nharsh, tenacious, stony, strong loams, difficult to work, are not\r\nuncommon: but they are quite different from English clays.\r\n\r\nFriable, sandy loams, dry but fertile, are very common, and they form the\r\nbest soils in the kingdom for tillage and sheep.  Tipperary and Roscommon\r\nabound particularly in them.  The most fertile of all are the bullock\r\npastures of Limerick, and the banks of the Shannon in Clare, called the\r\nCorcasses.  These are a mellow, putrid, friable loam.\r\n\r\nSand which is so common in England, and yet more common through Spain,\r\nFrance, Germany, and Poland, quite from Gibraltar to Petersburg, is\r\nnowhere met with in Ireland, except for narrow slips of hillocks, upon\r\nthe sea coast.  Nor did I ever meet with or hear of a chalky soil.\r\n\r\nThe bogs, of which foreigners have heard so much, are very extensive in\r\nIreland; that of Allen extends eighty miles, and is computed to contain\r\nthree hundred thousand acres.  There are others also, very extensive, and\r\nsmaller ones scattered over the whole kingdom; but these are not in\r\ngeneral more than are wanted for fuel.  When I come to speak of the\r\nimprovement of waste lands, I shall describe them particularly.\r\n\r\nBesides the great fertility of the soil, there are other circumstances\r\nwhich come within my sphere to mention.  Few countries can be better\r\nwatered by large and beautiful rivers; and it is remarkable that by much\r\nthe finest parts of the kingdom are on the banks of these rivers.\r\nWitness the Suir, Blackwater, the Liffey, the Boyne, the Nore, the\r\nBarrow, and part of the Shannon, they wash a scenery that can hardly be\r\nexceeded.  From the rockiness of the country, however, there are few of\r\nthem that have not obstructions, which are great impediments to inland\r\nnavigation.\r\n\r\nThe mountains of Ireland give to travelling that interesting variety\r\nwhich a flat country can never abound with.  And, at the same time, they\r\nare not in such number as to confer the usual character of poverty which\r\nattends them.  I was either upon or very near the most considerable in\r\nthe kingdom.  Mangerton, and the Reeks, in Kerry; the Galties in Cork;\r\nthose of Mourne in Down; Crow Patrick, and Nephin in Mayo, these are the\r\nprincipal in Ireland, and they are of a character, in height and\r\nsublimity, which should render them the objects of every traveller's\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nRelative to the climate of Ireland, a short residence cannot enable a man\r\nto speak much from his own experience; the observations I have made\r\nmyself confirm the idea of its being vastly wetter than England; from the\r\n20th of June to the 20th of October I kept a register, and there were, in\r\none hundred and twenty-two days, seventy-five of rain, and very many of\r\nthem incessant and heavy.  I have examined similar registers I kept in\r\nEngland, and can find no year that even approaches to such a moisture as\r\nthis.  But there is a register of an accurate diary published which\r\ncompares London and Cork.  The result is, that the quantity at the latter\r\nplace was double to that at London.  See Smith's \"History of Cork.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the information I received, I have reason to believe that the rainy\r\nseason sets in usually about the first of July and continues very wet\r\ntill September or October, when there is usually a dry fine season of a\r\nmonth or six weeks.  I resided in the county of Cork, etc., from October\r\ntill March, and found the winter much more soft and mild than ever I\r\nexperienced one in England.  I was also a whole summer there (1778), and\r\nit is fair to mention that it was as fine a one as ever I knew in\r\nEngland, though by no means so hot.  I think hardly so wet as very many I\r\nhave known in England.  The tops of the Galty mountains exhibited the\r\nonly snow we saw; and as to frosts, they were so slight and rare that I\r\nbelieve myrtles, and yet tenderer plants, would have survived without any\r\ncovering.  But when I say that the winter was not remarkable for being\r\nwet, I do not mean that we had a dry atmosphere.  The inches of rain\r\nwhich fell in the winter I speak of would not mark the moisture of the\r\nclimate.  As many inches will fall in a single tropical shower as in a\r\nwhole year in England.  See Mitchel's \"Present State of Great Britain and\r\nNorth America.\"  But if the clouds presently disperse, and a bright sun\r\nshines, the air may soon be dry.  The worst circumstance of the climate\r\nof Ireland is the constant moisture without rain.  Wet a piece of\r\nleather, and lay it in a room where there is neither sun nor fire, and it\r\nwill not in summer even be dry in a month.  I have known gentlemen in\r\nIreland deny their climate being moister than England, but if they have\r\neyes let them open them, and see the verdure that clothes their rocks,\r\nand compare it with ours in England--where rocky soils are of a russet\r\nbrown however sweet the food for sheep.  Does not their island lie more\r\nexposed to the great Atlantic; and does not the west wind blow\r\nthree-fourths of a year?  If there was another island yet more westward,\r\nwould not the climate of Ireland be improved?  Such persons speak equally\r\nagainst fact, reason, and philosophy.  That the moisture of a climate\r\ndoes not depend on the quantity of rain that falls, but on the powers of\r\naerial evaporation, Dr. Dobson has clearly proved.  \"Phil. Trans.\" vol.\r\nlxvii., part i., p. 244.\r\n\r\n\r\nOppression.\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore I conclude this article of the common labouring poor in Ireland, I\r\nmust observe, that their happiness depends not merely upon the payment of\r\ntheir labour, their clothes, or their food; the subordination of the\r\nlower classes, degenerating into oppression, is not to be overlooked.\r\nThe poor in all countries, and under all governments, are both paid and\r\nfed, yet there is an infinite difference between them in different ones.\r\nThis inquiry will by no means turn out so favourable as the preceding\r\narticles.  It must be very apparent to every traveller through that\r\ncountry, that the labouring poor are treated with harshness, and are in\r\nall respects so little considered that their want of importance seems a\r\nperfect contrast to their situation in England, of which country,\r\ncomparatively speaking, they reign the sovereigns.  The age has improved\r\nso much in humanity, that even the poor Irish have experienced its\r\ninfluence, and are every day treated better and better; but still the\r\nremnant of the old manners, the abominable distinction of religion,\r\nunited with the oppressive conduct of the little country gentlemen, or\r\nrather vermin of the kingdom, who never were out of it, altogether bear\r\nstill very heavy on the poor people, and subject them to situations more\r\nmortifying than we ever behold in England.  The landlord of an Irish\r\nestate, inhabited by Roman Catholics, is a sort of despot who yields\r\nobedience, in whatever concerns the poor, to no law but that of his will.\r\nTo discover what the liberty of the people is, we must live among them,\r\nand not look for it in the statutes of the realm: the language of written\r\nlaw may be that of liberty, but the situation of the poor may speak no\r\nlanguage but that of slavery.  There is too much of this contradiction in\r\nIreland; a long series of oppressions, aided by many very ill-judged\r\nlaws, have brought landlords into a habit of exerting a very lofty\r\nsuperiority, and their vassals into that of an almost unlimited\r\nsubmission: speaking a language that is despised, professing a religion\r\nthat is abhorred and being disarmed, the poor find themselves in many\r\ncases slaves even in the bosom of written liberty.  Landlords that have\r\nresided much abroad are usually humane in their ideas, but the habit of\r\ntyranny naturally contracts the mind, so that even in this polished age\r\nthere are instances of a severe carriage towards the poor, which is quite\r\nunknown in England.\r\n\r\nA landlord in Ireland can scarcely invent an order which a servant,\r\nlabourer, or cottar dares to refuse to execute.  Nothing satisfies him\r\nbut an unlimited submission.  Disrespect, or anything tending towards\r\nsauciness, he may punish with his cane or his horsewhip with the most\r\nperfect security; a poor man would have his bones broke if he offered to\r\nlift his hands in his own defence.  Knocking-down is spoken of in the\r\ncountry in a manner that makes an Englishman stare.  Landlords of\r\nconsequence have assured me that many of their cottars would think\r\nthemselves honoured by having their wives and daughters sent for to the\r\nbed of their master; a mark of slavery that proves the oppression under\r\nwhich such people must live.  Nay, I have heard anecdotes of the lives of\r\npeople being made free with without any apprehension of the justice of a\r\njury.  But let it not be imagined that this is common; formerly it\r\nhappened every day, but law gains ground.  It must strike the most\r\ncareless traveller to see whole strings of cars whipped into a ditch by a\r\ngentleman's footman to make way for his carriage; if they are overturned\r\nor broken in pieces, no matter, it is taken in patience; were they to\r\ncomplain they would perhaps be horsewhipped.  The execution of the laws\r\nlies very much in the hands of justices of the peace, many of whom are\r\ndrawn from the most illiberal class in the kingdom.  If a poor man lodges\r\na complaint against a gentleman, or any animal that chooses to call\r\nitself a gentleman, and the justice issues out a summons for his\r\nappearance, it is a fixed affront, and he will infallibly be called out.\r\nWhere manners are in conspiracy against law, to whom are the oppressed\r\npeople to have recourse?  It is a fact, that a poor man having a contest\r\nwith a gentleman, must--but I am talking nonsense, they know their\r\nsituation too well to think of it; they can have no defence, but by means\r\nof protection from one gentleman against another, who probably protects\r\nhis vassal as he would the sheep he intends to eat.\r\n\r\nThe colours of this picture are not charged.  To assert that all these\r\ncases are common would be an exaggeration, but to say that an unfeeling\r\nlandlord will do all this with impunity, is to keep strictly to truth:\r\nand what is liberty but a farce and a jest, if its blessings are received\r\nas the favour of kindness and humanity, instead of being the inheritance\r\nof right?\r\n\r\nConsequences have flowed from these oppressions which ought long ago to\r\nhave put a stop to them.  In England we have heard much of White-boys,\r\nSteel-boys, Oak-boys, Peep-of-day-boys, etc.  But these various\r\ninsurgents are not to be confounded, for they are very different.  The\r\nproper distinction in the discontents of the people is into Protestant\r\nand Catholic.  All but the White-boys were among the manufacturing\r\nProtestants in the north: the White-boys Catholic labourers in the south.\r\nFrom the best intelligence I could gain, the riots of the manufacturers\r\nhad no other foundation but such variations in the manufacture as all\r\nfabrics experience, and which they had themselves known and submitted to\r\nbefore.  The case, however, was different with the White-boys, who being\r\nlabouring Catholics met with all those oppressions I have described, and\r\nwould probably have continued in full submission had not very severe\r\ntreatment in respect of tithes, united with a great speculative rise of\r\nrent about the same time, blown up the flame of resistance; the atrocious\r\nacts they were guilty of made them the object of general indignation;\r\nacts were passed for their punishment, which seemed calculated for the\r\nmeridian of Barbary.  This arose to such a height that by one they were\r\nto be hanged under circumstances without the common formalities of a\r\ntrial, which, though repealed the following session, marks the spirit of\r\npunishment; while others remain yet the law of the land, that would if\r\nexecuted tend more to raise than quell an insurrection.  From all which\r\nit is manifest that the gentlemen of Ireland never thought of a radical\r\ncure from overlooking the real cause of the disease, which in fact lay in\r\nthemselves, and not in the wretches they doomed to the gallows.  Let them\r\nchange their own conduct entirely, and the poor will not long riot.\r\nTreat them like men who ought to be as free as yourselves.  Put an end to\r\nthat system of religious persecution which for seventy years has divided\r\nthe kingdom against itself; in these two circumstances lies the cure of\r\ninsurrection; perform them completely, and you will have an affectionate\r\npoor, instead of oppressed and discontented vassals.\r\n\r\nA better treatment of the poor in Ireland is a very material point of the\r\nwelfare of the whole British Empire.  Events may happen which may\r\nconvince us fatally of this truth; if not, oppression must have broken\r\nall the spirit and resentment of men.  By what policy the Government of\r\nEngland can for so many years have permitted such an absurd system to be\r\nmatured in Ireland is beyond the power of plain sense to discover.\r\n\r\n\r\nEmigrations.\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore the American war broke out, the Irish and Scotch emigrations were\r\na constant subject of conversation in England, and occasioned much\r\ndiscourse even in parliament.  The common observation was, that if they\r\nwere not stopped, those countries would be ruined, and they were\r\ngenerally attributed to a great rise of rents.  Upon going over to\r\nIreland I determined to omit no opportunities of discovering the cause\r\nand extent of this emigration, and my information, as may be seen in the\r\nminutes of the journey, was very regular.  I have only a few general\r\nremarks to make on it here.\r\n\r\nThe spirit of emigration in Ireland appeared to be confined to two\r\ncircumstances, the Presbyterian religion, and the linen manufacture.  I\r\nheard of very few emigrants except among manufacturers of that\r\npersuasion.  The Catholics never went; they seem not only tied to the\r\ncountry, but almost to the parish in which their ancestors lived.  As to\r\nthe emigration in the north it was an error in England to suppose it a\r\nnovelty which arose with the increase in rents.  The contrary was the\r\nfact; it had subsisted perhaps forty years, insomuch that at the ports of\r\nBelfast, Derry, etc., the passenger trade, as they called it, had long\r\nbeen a regular branch of commerce, which employed several ships, and\r\nconsisted in carrying people to America.  The increasing population of\r\nthe country made it an increasing trade, but when the linen trade was\r\nlow, the passenger trade was always high.  At the time of Lord Donegan\r\nletting his estate in the north, the linen business suffered a temporary\r\ndecline, which sent great numbers to America, and gave rise to the error\r\nthat it was occasioned by the increase of his rents.  The fact, however,\r\nwas otherwise, for great numbers of those who went from his lands\r\nactually sold those leases for considerable sums, the hardship of which\r\nwas supposed to have driven them to America.  Some emigration, therefore,\r\nalways existed, and its increase depended on the fluctuations of linen;\r\nbut as to the effect there was as much error in the conclusions drawn in\r\nEngland as before in the cause.\r\n\r\nIt is the misfortune of all manufactures worked for a foreign market to\r\nbe upon an insecure footing; periods of declension will come, and when in\r\nconsequence of them great numbers of people are out of employment, the\r\nbest circumstance is their enlisting in the army or navy, and it is the\r\ncommon result; but unfortunately the manufacture in Ireland (of which I\r\nshall have occasion to speak more hereafter) is not confined as it ought\r\nto be to towns, but spreads into all cabins of the country.  Being half\r\nfarmers, half manufacturers, they have too much property in cattle, etc.,\r\nto enlist when idle; if they convert it into cash it will enable them to\r\npay their passage to America, an alternative always chosen in preference\r\nto the military life.  The consequence is, that they must live without\r\nwork till their substance is quite consumed before they will enlist.  Men\r\nwho are in such a situation that from various causes they cannot work,\r\nand won't enlist, should emigrate; if they stay at home they must remain\r\na burthen upon the community.  Emigration should not, therefore, be\r\ncondemned in states so ill-governed as to possess many people willing to\r\nwork, but without employment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION II.--Roads, Cars.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor a country, so very far behind us as Ireland, to have got suddenly so\r\nmuch the start of us in the article of roads, is a spectacle that cannot\r\nfail to strike the English traveller exceedingly.  But from this\r\ncommendation the turnpikes in general must be excluded; they are as bad\r\nas the bye-roads are admirable.  It is a common complaint that the tolls\r\nof the turnpikes are so many jobs, and the roads left in a state that\r\ndisgrace the kingdom.\r\n\r\nThe following is the system on which the cross-roads are made.  Any\r\nperson wishing to make or mend a road has it measured by two persons, who\r\nswear to the measurement before a justice of the peace.  It is described\r\nas leading from one market-town to another (it matters not in what\r\ndirection), that it will be a public good, and that it will require such\r\na sum per perch of twenty-one feet, to make or repair the same.  A\r\ncertificate to this purpose (of which printed forms are sold), with the\r\nblanks filled up, is signed by the measurers, and also by two persons\r\ncalled overseers, one of whom is usually the person applying for the\r\nroad, the other the labourer he intends to employ as an overseer of the\r\nwork, which overseer swears also before the justice the truth of the\r\nvaluation.  The certificate thus prepared is given by any person to some\r\none of the grand jury, at either of the assizes, but usually in the\r\nspring.  When all the common business of trials is over, the jury meets\r\non that of roads; the chairman reads the certificates, and they are all\r\nput to the vote, whether to be granted or not.  If rejected, they are\r\ntorn in pieces and no further notice taken; if granted, they are put on\r\nthe file.\r\n\r\nThis vote of approbation, without any further form, enables the person\r\nwho applied for the presentment immediately to construct or repair the\r\nroad in question, which he must do at his own expense; he must finish it\r\nby the following assizes, when he is to send a certificate of his having\r\nexpended the money pursuant to the application; this certificate is\r\nsigned by the foreman, who also signs an order on the treasurer of the\r\ncounty to pay him, which is done immediately.  In like manner are\r\nbridges, houses of correction, gaols, etc. etc., built and repaired.  If\r\na bridge over a river which parts two counties, half is done by one and\r\nthe other half by the other county.\r\n\r\nThe expense of these works is raised by a tax on the lands, paid by the\r\ntenant; in some counties it is acreable, but in others it is on the\r\nplough land, and as no two plough lands are of the same size, is a very\r\nunequal tax.  In the county of Meath it is acreable, and amounts to one\r\nshilling per acre, being the highest in Ireland; but in general it is\r\nfrom threepence to sixpence per acre, and amounts of late years through\r\nthe whole kingdom to one hundred and forty thousand pounds a year.\r\n\r\nThe juries will very rarely grant a presentment for a road which amounts\r\nto above fifty pounds, or for more than six or seven shillings a perch,\r\nso that if a person wants more to be made than such a sum will do, he\r\ndivides it into two or three different measurements or presentments.  By\r\nthe Act of Parliament, all presentment-roads must be twenty-one feet wide\r\nat least from fence to fence, and fourteen feet of it formed with stone\r\nor gravel.\r\n\r\nAs the power of the grand jury extends in this manner to the cutting new\r\nroads where none ever were before, as well as to the repairing and\r\nwidening old ones, exclusive, however, of parks, gardens, etc., it was\r\nnecessary to put a restriction against the wanton expense of it.  Any\r\npresentment may be traversed that is opposed, by denying the allegations\r\nof the certificate; this is sure of delaying it until another assizes,\r\nand in the meantime persons are appointed to view the line of road\r\ndemanded, and report on the necessity or hardship of the case.  The\r\npayment of the money may also be traversed after the certificate of its\r\nbeing laid out; for if any person views and finds it a manifest\r\nimposition and job, he has that power to delay payment until the cause is\r\ncleared up and proved.  But this traverse is not common.  Any persons are\r\neligible for asking presentments; but it is usually done only by resident\r\ngentlemen, agents, clergy, or respectable tenantry.  It follows\r\nnecessarily, that every person is desirous of making the roads leading to\r\nhis own house, and that private interest alone is considered in it, which\r\nI have heard objected to the measure; but this I must own appears to me\r\nthe great merit of it.  Whenever individuals act for the public alone,\r\nthe public is very badly served; but when the pursuit of their own\r\ninterest is the way to benefit the public, then is the public good sure\r\nto be promoted; such is the case of presentment of roads: for a few years\r\nthe good roads were all found leading from houses like rays from a\r\ncentre, with a surrounding space, without any communication; but every\r\nyear brought the remedy, until in a short time, those rays pointing from\r\nso many centres met, and then the communication was complete.  The\r\noriginal Act passed but seventeen years ago, and the effect of it in all\r\nparts of the kingdom is so great, that I found it perfectly practicable\r\nto travel upon wheels by a map; I will go here; I will go there; I could\r\ntrace a route upon paper as wild as fancy could dictate, and everywhere I\r\nfound beautiful roads without break or hindrance, to enable me to realise\r\nmy design.  What a figure would a person make in England, who should\r\nattempt to move in that manner, where the roads, as Dr. Burn has well\r\nobserved, are almost in as bad a state as in the time of Philip and Mary.\r\nIn a few years there will not be a piece of bad road except turnpikes in\r\nall Ireland.  The money raised for this first and most important of all\r\nnational purposes, is expended among the people who pay it, employs\r\nthemselves and their teams, encourages their agriculture, and facilitates\r\nso greatly the improvement of waste lands, that it ought always to be\r\nconsidered as the first step to any undertaking of that sort.\r\n\r\nAt first, roads, in common with bridges, were paid out of the general\r\ntreasure of the county, but by a subsequent act the road tax is now on\r\nbaronies; each barony pays for its own roads.  By another act juries were\r\nenabled to grant presentments of narrow mountain roads, at two shillings\r\nand sixpence a perch.  By another, they were empowered to grant\r\npresentments of footpaths, by the side of roads, at one shilling a perch.\r\nBy a very late act, they are also enabled to contract at three-halfpence\r\nper perch per annum from the first making of a road, for keeping it in\r\nrepair, which before could not be done without a fresh presentment.\r\nArthur King, Esq. of Moniva, whose agriculture is described in the\r\npreceding minutes, and who at that time represented the county of Galway,\r\nwas the worthy citizen who first brought this excellent measure into\r\nparliament: Ireland, and every traveller that ever visits it ought, to\r\nthe latest time, to revere the memory of such a distinguished benefactor\r\nto the public.  Before that time the roads, like those of England,\r\nremained impassable, under the miserable police of the six days' labour.\r\nSimilar good effects would here flow from adopting the measure, which\r\nwould ease the kingdom of a great burthen in its public effects\r\nabsolutely contemptible; and the tax here, as in Ireland, ought to be so\r\nlaid, as to be borne by the tenant whose business it is at present to\r\nrepair.\r\n\r\nUpon the imperfections of the Irish system I have only to remark, that\r\njuries should, in some cases, be more ready than they are to grant these\r\npresentments.  In general, they are extremely liberal, but sometimes they\r\ntake silly freaks of giving none, or very few.  Experience having proved,\r\nfrom the general goodness of the roads, that abuses cannot be very great,\r\nthey should go on with spirit to perfect the great work throughout the\r\nkingdom; and as a check upon those who lay out the money, it might\r\nperhaps be advisable to print county maps of the presentment roads, with\r\ncorresponding lists and tables of the names of all persons who have\r\nobtained presentments, the sums they received, and for what roads.  These\r\nshould be given freely by the jurymen, to all their acquaintance, that\r\nevery man might know, to whose carelessness or jobbing the public was\r\nindebted for bad roads, when they had paid for good ones.  Such a\r\npractice would certainly deter many.\r\n\r\nAt 11,042,642 acres in the kingdom, 140,000 pounds a year amounts to just\r\nthreepence an acre for the whole territory: a very trifling tax for such\r\nan improvement, and which almost ranks in public ease and benefit with\r\nthat of the post-office.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION III.--Manners and Customs.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Quid leges sine moribus,\r\n    Vana proficiunt!\r\n\r\nIt is but an illiberal business for a traveller, who designs to publish\r\nremarks upon a country to sit down coolly in his closet and write a\r\nsatire on the inhabitants.  Severity of that sort must be enlivened with\r\nan uncommon share of wit and ridicule, to please.  Where very gross\r\nabsurdities are found, it is fair and manly to note them; but to enter\r\ninto character and disposition is generally uncandid, since there are no\r\npeople but might be better than they are found, and none but have virtues\r\nwhich deserve attention, at least as much as their failings; for these\r\nreasons this section would not have found a place in my observations, had\r\nnot some persons, of much more flippancy than wisdom, given very gross\r\nmisrepresentations of the Irish nation.  It is with pleasure, therefore,\r\nthat I take up the pen on the present occasion; as a much longer\r\nresidence there enables me to exhibit a very different picture; in doing\r\nthis, I shall be free to remark, wherein I think the conduct of certain\r\nclasses may have given rise to general and consequently injurious\r\ncondemnation.\r\n\r\nThere are three races of people in Ireland, so distinct as to strike the\r\nleast attentive traveller: these are the Spanish which are found in\r\nKerry, and a part of Limerick and Cork, tall and thin, but well made, a\r\nlong visage, dark eyes, and long black lank hair.  The time is not remote\r\nwhen the Spaniards had a kind of settlement on the coast of Kerry, which\r\nseemed to be overlooked by government.  There were many of them in Queen\r\nElizabeth's reign, nor were they entirely driven out till the time of\r\nCromwell.  There is an island of Valentia on that coast, with various\r\nother names, certainly Spanish.  The Scotch race is in the north, where\r\nare to be found the feature which are supposed to mark that people, their\r\naccent and many of their customs.  In a district near Dublin, but more\r\nparticularly in the baronies of Bargie and Forth in the county of\r\nWexford, the Saxon tongue is spoken without any mixture of the Irish, and\r\nthe people have a variety of customs mentioned in the minutes, which\r\ndistinguish them from their neighbours.  The rest of the kingdom is made\r\nup of mongrels.  The Milesian race of Irish, which may be called native,\r\nare scattered over the kingdom, but chiefly found in Connaught and\r\nMunster; a few considerable families, whose genealogy is undoubted,\r\nremain, but none of them with considerable possessions except the\r\nO'Briens and Mr. O'Neil; the former have near twenty thousand pounds a\r\nyear in the family, the latter half as much, the remnant of a property\r\nonce his ancestors, which now forms six or seven of the greatest estates\r\nin the kingdom.  O'Hara and M'Dermot are great names in Connaught, and\r\nO'Donnohue a considerable one in Kerry; but I heard of a family of\r\nO'Drischal's in Cork, who claim an origin prior in Ireland to any of the\r\nMilesian race.\r\n\r\nThe only divisions which a traveller, who passed through the kingdom\r\nwithout making any residence could make, would be into people of\r\nconsiderable fortune and mob.  The intermediate division of the scale, so\r\nnumerous and respectable in England, would hardly attract the least\r\nnotice in Ireland.  A residence in the kingdom convinces one, however,\r\nthat there is another class in general of small fortune--country\r\ngentlemen and renters of land.  The manners, habits, and customs of\r\npeople of considerable fortune are much the same everywhere, at least\r\nthere is very little difference between England and Ireland, it is among\r\nthe common people one must look for those traits by which we discriminate\r\na national character.  The circumstances which struck me most in the\r\ncommon Irish were, vivacity and a great and eloquent volubility of\r\nspeech; one would think they could take snuff and talk without tiring\r\ntill doomsday.  They are infinitely more cheerful and lively than\r\nanything we commonly see in England, having nothing of that incivility of\r\nsullen silence with which so many Englishmen seem to wrap themselves up,\r\nas if retiring within their own importance.  Lazy to an excess at work,\r\nbut so spiritedly active at play, that at hurling, which is the cricket\r\nof savages, they shew the greatest feats of agility.  Their love of\r\nsociety is as remarkable as their curiosity is insatiable; and their\r\nhospitality to all comers, be their own poverty ever so pinching, has too\r\nmuch merit to be forgotten.  Pleased to enjoyment with a joke, or witty\r\nrepartee, they will repeat it with such expression, that the laugh will\r\nbe universal.  Warm friends and revengeful enemies; they are inviolable\r\nin their secrecy, and inevitable in their resentment; with such a notion\r\nof honour, that neither threat nor reward would induce them to betray the\r\nsecret or person of a man, though an oppressor, whose property they would\r\nplunder without ceremony.  Hard drinkers and quarrelsome; great liars,\r\nbut civil, submissive, and obedient.  Dancing is so universal among them,\r\nthat there are everywhere itinerant dancing-masters, to whom the cottars\r\npay sixpence a quarter for teaching their families.  Besides the Irish\r\njig, which they can dance with a most luxuriant expression, minuets and\r\ncountry-dances are taught; and I even heard some talk of cotillions\r\ncoming in.\r\n\r\nSome degree of education is also general, hedge schools, as they are\r\ncalled, (they might as well be termed ditch ones, for I have seen many a\r\nditch full of scholars,) are everywhere to be met with where reading and\r\nwriting are taught; schools are also common for men; I have seen a dozen\r\ngreat fellows at school, and was told they were educating with an\r\nintention of being priests.  Many strokes in their character are\r\nevidently to be ascribed to the extreme oppression under which they live.\r\nIf they are as great thieves and liars as they are reported, it is\r\ncertainly owing to this cause.\r\n\r\nIf from the lowest class we rise to the highest, all there is gaiety,\r\npleasure, luxury, and extravagance; the town life at Dublin is formed on\r\nthe model of that of London.  Every night in the winter there is a ball\r\nor a party, where the polite circle meet, not to enjoy but to sweat each\r\nother; a great crowd crammed into twenty feet square gives a zest to the\r\n_agrements_ of small talk and whist.  There are four or five houses large\r\nenough to receive a company commodiously, but the rest are so small as to\r\nmake parties detestable.  There is however an agreeable society in\r\nDublin, in which a man of large fortune will not find his time heavy.\r\nThe style of living may be guessed from the fortunes of the resident\r\nnobility and great commoners; there are about thirty that possess incomes\r\nfrom seven to twenty thousand pounds a year.  The court has nothing\r\nremarkable or splendid in it, but varies very much, according to the\r\nprivate fortune or liberality of disposition in the lord lieutenant.\r\n\r\nIn the country their life has some circumstances which are not commonly\r\nseen in England.  Large tracts of land are kept in hand by everybody to\r\nsupply the deficiencies of markets; this gives such a plenty, that,\r\nunited with the lowness of taxes and prices, one would suppose it\r\ndifficult for them to spend their incomes, if Dublin in the winter did\r\nnot lend assistance.  Let it be considered that the prices of meat are\r\nmuch lower than in England; poultry only a fourth of the price; wild fowl\r\nand fish in vastly greater plenty; rum and brandy not half the price;\r\ncoffee, tea, and wines far cheaper; labour not above a third; servants'\r\nwages upon an average thirty per cent. cheaper.  That taxes are\r\ninconsiderable, for there is no land-tax, no poor-rates, no window tax,\r\nno candle or soap tax, only half a wheel-tax, no servants' tax, and a\r\nvariety of other articles heavily burdened in England, but not in\r\nIreland.  Considering all this, one would think they could not spend\r\ntheir incomes; they do contrive it, however.  In this business they are\r\nassisted by two customs that have an admirable tendency to it, great\r\nnumbers of horses and servants.\r\n\r\nIn England such extensive demesnes would be parks around the seats for\r\nbeauty as much as use, but it is not so in Ireland; the words deer-park\r\nand demesne are to be distinguished; there are great demesnes without any\r\nparks, but a want of taste, too common in Ireland, is having a deer-park\r\nat a distance from the house; the residence surrounded by walls, or\r\nhedges, or cabins; and the lawn inclosure scattered with animals of\r\nvarious sorts, perhaps three miles off.  The small quantity of corn\r\nproportioned to the total acres, shows how little tillage is attended to\r\neven by those who are the best able to carry it on; and the column of\r\nturnips proves in the clearest manner what the progress of improvement is\r\nin that kingdom.  The number of horses may almost be esteemed a satire\r\nupon common sense; were they well fed enough to be useful, they would not\r\nbe so numerous, but I have found a good hack for a common ride scarce in\r\na house where there were a hundred.  Upon an average, the horses in\r\ngentlemen's stables throughout the kingdom are not fed half so well as\r\nthey are in England by men of equal fortune; yet the number makes the\r\nexpense of them very heavy.\r\n\r\nAnother circumstance to be remarked in the country life is the\r\nmiserableness of many of their houses; there are men of five thousand a\r\nyear in Ireland, who live in habitations that a man of seven hundred a\r\nyear in England would disdain; an air of neatness, order, dress, and\r\n_proprete_, is wanting to a surprising degree around the mansion; even\r\nnew and excellent houses have often nothing of this about them.  But the\r\nbadness of the houses is remedying every hour throughout the whole\r\nkingdom, for the number of new ones just built, or building, is\r\nprodigiously great.  I should suppose there were not ten dwellings in the\r\nkingdom thirty years ago that were fit for an English pig to live in.\r\nGardens were equally bad, but now they are running into the contrary\r\nextreme, and wall in five, six, ten, and even twenty Irish acres for a\r\ngarden, but generally double or treble what is necessary.\r\n\r\nThe tables of people of fortune are very plentifully spread; many\r\nelegantly, differing in nothing from those of England.  I think I\r\nremarked that venison wants the flavour it has with us, probably for the\r\nsame reason, that the produce of rich parks is never equal to that of\r\npoor ones; the moisture of the climate, and the richness of the soil,\r\ngive fat but not flavour.  Another reason is the smallness of the parks,\r\na man who has three or four thousand acres in his hands, has not perhaps\r\nabove three or four hundred in his deer-park, and range is a great point\r\nfor good venison.  Nor do I think that garden vegetables have the flavour\r\nfound in those of England, certainly owing to the climate; green peas I\r\nfound everywhere perfectly insipid, and lettuce, etc., not good.  Claret\r\nis the common wine of all tables, and so much inferior to what is drunk\r\nin England, that it does not appear to be the same wine; but their port\r\nis incomparable, so much better than the English, as to prove, if proof\r\nwas wanting, the abominable adulterations it must undergo with us.\r\nDrinking and duelling are two charges which have long been alleged\r\nagainst the gentlemen of Ireland, but the change of manners which has\r\ntaken place in that kingdom is not generally known in England.\r\nDrunkenness ought no longer to be a reproach, for at every table I was at\r\nin Ireland I saw a perfect freedom reign, every person drank just as\r\nlittle as they pleased, nor have I ever been asked to drink a single\r\nglass more than I had an inclination for; I may go farther and assert\r\nthat hard drinking is very rare among people of fortune; yet it is\r\ncertain that they sit much longer at table than in England.  I was much\r\nsurprised at first going over to find no summons to coffee, the company\r\noften sitting till eight, nine, or ten o'clock before they went to the\r\nladies.  If a gentleman likes tea or coffee, he retires without saying\r\nanything; a stranger of rank may propose it to the master of the house,\r\nwho from custom contrary to that of England, will not stir till he\r\nreceives such a hint, as they think it would imply a desire to save their\r\nwine.  If the gentlemen were generally desirous of tea, I take it for\r\ngranted they would have it, but their slighting is one inconvenience to\r\nsuch as desire it, not knowing when it is provided, conversation may\r\ncarry them beyond the time, and then if they do trifle over the coffee it\r\nwill certainly be cold.  There is a want of attention in this, which the\r\nladies should remedy, if they will not break the old custom and send to\r\nthe gentlemen, which is what they ought to do, they certainly should have\r\na salver fresh.  I must, however, remark, that at the politest tables,\r\nwhich are those of people who have resided much out of Ireland, this\r\npoint is conducted exactly as it is in England.\r\n\r\nDuelling was once carried to an excess, which was a real reproach and\r\nscandal to the kingdom; it of course proceeded from excessive drinking;\r\nas the cause has disappeared, the effect has nearly followed; not\r\nhowever, entirely, for it is yet far more common among people of fashion\r\nthan in England.  Of all practices, a man who felt for the honour of his\r\ncountry would wish soonest to banish this, for there is not one\r\nfavourable conclusion to be drawn from it: as to courage, nobody can\r\nquestion that of a polite and enlightened nation, entitled to a share of\r\nthe reputation of the age; but it implies uncivilised manners, an\r\nignorance of those forms which govern polite societies, or else a brutal\r\ndrunkenness; the latter is no longer the cause or the pretence.  As to\r\nthe former, they would place the national character so backward, would\r\ntake from it so much of its pretence to civilisation, elegance and\r\npoliteness of manners, that no true Irishman would be pleased with the\r\nimputation.  Certain it is, that none are so captious as those who think\r\nthemselves neglected or despised; and none are so ready to believe\r\nthemselves either one or the other as persons unused to good company.\r\nCaptious people, therefore, who are ready to take an affront, must\r\ninevitably have been accustomed to ill company, unless there should be\r\nsomething uncommonly crooked in their natural dispositions, which is not\r\nto be supposed.  Let every man that fights his one, two, three, or\r\nhalf-a-dozen duels, receive it as a maxim, that every one he adds to the\r\nnumber is but an additional proof of his being ill-educated, and having\r\nvitiated his manners by the contagion of bad company; who is it that can\r\nreckon the most numerous rencontres? who but the bucks, bloods,\r\nlandjobbers, and little drunken country gentlemen?  Ought not people of\r\nfashion to blush at a practice which will very soon be the distinction\r\nonly of the most contemptible of the people? the point of honour will and\r\nmust remain for the decision of certain affronts, but it will rarely be\r\nhad recourse to in polite, sensible, and well-bred company.  The practice\r\namong real gentlemen in Ireland every day declining is a strong proof\r\nthat a knowledge of the world corrects the old manners, and consequently\r\nits having ever been prevalent was owing to the causes to which I have\r\nattributed it.\r\n\r\nThere is another point of manners somewhat connected with the present\r\nsubject, which partly induced me to place a motto at the head of this\r\nsection.  It is the conduct of juries; the criminal law of Ireland is the\r\nsame as that of England, but in the execution it is so different as\r\nscarcely to be known.  I believe it is a fact, at least I have been\r\nassured so, that no man was ever hanged in Ireland for killing another in\r\na duel: the security is such that nobody ever thought of removing out of\r\nthe way of justice, yet there have been deaths of that sort, which had no\r\nmore to do with honour than stabbing in the dark.  I believe Ireland is\r\nthe only country in Europe, I am sure it is the only part of the British\r\ndominions, where associations among men of fortune are necessary for\r\napprehending ravishers.  It is scarcely credible how many young women\r\nhave even of late years been ravished, and carried off in order (as they\r\ngenerally have fortunes) to gain to appearance a voluntary marriage.\r\nThese actions, it is true, are not committed by the class I am\r\nconsidering at present; but they are tried by them, and acquitted.  I\r\nthink there has been only one man executed for that crime, which is so\r\ncommon as to occasion the associations I mentioned; it is to this supine\r\nexecution of the law that such enormities are owing.  Another\r\ncircumstance which has the effect of screening all sorts of offenders, is\r\nmen of fortune protecting them, and making interest for their acquittal,\r\nwhich is attended with a variety of evil consequences.  I heard it\r\nboasted in the county of Fermanagh, that there had not been a man hanged\r\nin it for two-and-twenty years; all I concluded from this was, that there\r\nhad been many a jury who deserved it richly.\r\n\r\nLet me, however, conclude what I have to observe on the conduct of the\r\nprincipal people residing in Ireland, that there are great numbers among\r\nthem who are as liberal in all their ideas as any people in Europe; that\r\nthey have seen the errors which have given an ill character to the\r\nmanners of their country, and done everything that example could effect\r\nto produce a change: that that happy change has been partly effected, and\r\nis effecting every hour, insomuch that a man may go into a vast variety\r\nof families which he will find actuated by no other principles than those\r\nof the most cultivated politeness, and the most liberal urbanity.\r\n\r\nBut I must now come to another class of people, to whose conduct it is\r\nalmost entirely owing that the character of the nation has not that\r\nlustre abroad, which I dare assert it will soon very generally merit:\r\nthis is the class of little country gentlemen; tenants, who drink their\r\nclaret by means of profit rents; jobbers in farms; bucks; your fellows\r\nwith round hats, edged with gold, who hunt in the day, get drunk in the\r\nevening, and fight the next morning.  I shall not dwell on a subject so\r\nperfectly disagreeable, but remark that these are the men among whom\r\ndrinking, wrangling, quarrelling, fighting, ravishing, etc. etc. are\r\nfound as in their native soil; once to a degree that made them a pest of\r\nsociety; they are growing better, but even now, one or two of them got by\r\naccident (where they have no business) into better company are sufficient\r\nvery much to derange the pleasures that result from a liberal\r\nconversation.  A new spirit; new fashions; new modes of politeness\r\nexhibited by the higher ranks are imitated by the lower, which will, it\r\nis to be hoped, put an end to this race of beings; and either drive their\r\nsons and cousins into the army or navy, or sink them into plain farmers\r\nlike those we have in England, where it is common to see men with much\r\ngreater property without pretending to be gentlemen.  I repeat it from\r\nthe intelligence I received, that even this class are very different from\r\nwhat they were twenty years ago, and improve so fast that the time will\r\nsoon come when the national character will not be degraded by any set.\r\n\r\nThat character is upon the whole respectable: it would be unfair to\r\nattribute to the nation at large the vices and follies of only one class\r\nof individuals.  Those persons from whom it is candid to take a general\r\nestimate do credit to their country.  That they are a people learned,\r\nlively, and ingenious, the admirable authors they have produced will be\r\nan eternal monument; witness their Swift, Sterne, Congreve, Boyle,\r\nBerkeley, Steele, Farquhar, Southerne, and Goldsmith.  Their talent for\r\neloquence is felt, and acknowledged in the parliaments of both the\r\nkingdoms.  Our own service both by sea and land, as well as that\r\n(unfortunately for us) of the principal monarchies of Europe, speak their\r\nsteady and determined courage.  Every unprejudiced traveller who visits\r\nthem will be as much pleased with their cheerfulness, as obliged by their\r\nhospitality; and will find them a brave, polite, and liberal people.",
