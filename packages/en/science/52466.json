In the dark regions underground she likewise shows us much that\r\nis remarkable or beautiful, or carries on gigantic operations, which are\r\nsometimes beneficent and sometimes disastrous to mankind.\r\n\r\nThere lie concealed the mysterious laboratories of fire, which reveal to\r\nus their existence in earthquakes and volcanic explosions. There, in\r\nsuccessive strata, repose the remains of extinct animals and plants.\r\nThere many a wonderful cavern may be seen, with its fantastic\r\nstalactites, its rushing waters, and its noble halls. There have been\r\ndeposited the rich stores of mineral wealth—the metals, the coals, the\r\nsalt, the sulphur, &c.—without whose aid man would never have been more\r\nthan a savage.\r\n\r\nThe aim of the present work has been to describe the wonders of this\r\nhidden world in their various relations to man, now raising him to\r\nwealth, and now dooming him to destruction.\r\n\r\nThe author trusts that he may have succeeded in giving a sketch of the\r\nphenomena resulting from the action of subterranean forces, which, with\r\nhis account of the wonders of the sea, of the tropics, and of the frozen\r\nregions, may impart to the reader a fair idea of the history and present\r\ncondition of the wonderful world in which we live.\r\n\r\nSALON, NEAR LUDWIGSBURG:\r\n       _July 6,

Laurentian, named from its discovery northward of the River St.\r\n Lawrence in Canada.\r\n\r\n 2. Cambrian      }  These three groups owe their name to their\r\n\r\n 3. Silurian      }  occurrence in Wales and Devonshire,\r\n\r\n 4. Devonian      }  where they were first scientifically explored.\r\n\r\n 5. Carboniferous. In this group the most important coal-fields are\r\n found.\r\n\r\n 6. Permian, from the Russian province of Permia.\r\n\r\n 7. Triassic.\r\n\r\n 8. Lias.\r\n\r\n 9. Oolite.\r\n\r\n 10. Cretaceous.\r\n\r\n 11. Tertiary: subdivided into Eocene, Miocene, and Pliocene.\r\n\r\n 12. Recent marine and lacustrine strata.\r\n\r\nEach of these systems consists again of numerous sections and alternate\r\nlayers, sometimes of marine, sometimes of freshwater formation, the mere\r\nnaming of which would fill several pages.\r\n\r\nWhen we reflect that the Laurentian system alone has a thickness of\r\n30,000 feet; that many of the numerous subdivisions of the Triassic or\r\nOolitic group are 600, 800, or even several thousand feet thick, and\r\nthat each of these enormous sedimentary formations owes its existence to\r\nthe disintegration of pre-existing mountain masses—we can form at least\r\na faint notion of the enormous time which the whole system required for\r\nits completion.\r\n\r\n                    TABULAR   GEOLOGICAL   PROFILE.\r\n\r\n                 STRATA                  CHARACTERISTICS\r\n                                          FOSSIL REMAINS\r\n                          +--------+--------+------------------------\r\n T  {  1.

But while water has been constantly tending to\r\nreduce the irregularities of the earth’s surface to one dull level, the\r\nexpansive force of subterranean heat has been no less unceasingly active\r\nin\r\n\r\nrestoring the unevenness of the external crust by the ejection or\r\nprotrusion of new masses of stone (porphyry, trachyte, basalt, lava,\r\n&c.), and by the consequent disturbance, in a variety of ways, of the\r\nstratified rocks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  AQUEOUS STRATA DISTURBED BY IGNEOUS FORMATIONS.\r\n\r\n  B C D, aqueous strata, originally horizontal, raised by protrusion of\r\n    A, granitic rock.\r\n]\r\n\r\nPlutonic and volcanic eruptions and upheavings, in their reaction\r\nagainst the levelling tendencies of water, have in many places deranged,\r\nbroken, fractured, contorted, or raised strata deposited in horizontal\r\nlayers at the bottom of the sea, or of large inland lakes. Sometimes a\r\nhuge mass of crystalline rock, glowing from the furnaces of the deep,\r\nhas, by its irresistible expansion, slowly forced its way through the\r\nsuperincumbent sedimentary formations, which, yielding to the pressure\r\nfrom below, now form vast mountain slopes, or vertical rock walls, or\r\nhave even been so totally inverted that strata of a more ancient\r\nformation now overlie those of more modern date, and excite the wonder\r\nof the puzzled geologist.\r\n\r\nSometimes, also, volcanic eruptions, repeated through a long lapse of\r\nages and constantly accumulating lavas and cinders, have at length piled\r\nup large islands, such as Iceland or Madeira, which now raise their\r\nsummits thousands of feet above the ocean.\r\n\r\nBut subterranean fire, and its assistant, steam, have not only produced\r\nvast mechanical changes; they have also been the frequent causes of\r\ngreat chymical metamorphoses in the rocks subjected to their action. To\r\nthe calcining, decomposing, and vapour-generating effects of heat, we\r\ntrace the origin of the marble of Carrara, of alabaster, of gypsum, and\r\nall those various species of stone which geologists include under the\r\nname of metamorphic rocks.\r\n\r\nBesides the more paroxysmal and violent revolutions resulting from the\r\naction of subterranean fire, we find that the earth-rind has at all\r\ntimes been subject to slow oscillatory movements of upheaval and\r\nsubsidence, frequently alternating on the same spot with long periods of\r\nrest. The greater part of the actual dry land has been deep sea, and\r\nthen again land and ocean many times in succession; and doubtless the\r\nactual sea bottom would exhibit similar alternations were we able to\r\nexplore it. The same materials have repeatedly been exposed to all these\r\nchanges—now raised or poured out by subterranean fires, and then again\r\nswept away by the waters; now changed from solid rock into sand and mud,\r\nand then again converted, by pressure or heat, into solid rock. Thus the\r\nhistory of the earth-rind opens to us a vista into time no less grand\r\nand magnificent than the vista into space afforded by the contemplation\r\nof the starry heavens.\r\n\r\nThe oldest and the newest stratified rocks are composed of the same\r\nmineral substances; for clay, sandstone, and limestone occur in the\r\nSilurian and in the Carboniferous formation; in the Cretaceous and\r\nTriassic systems; in the Tertiary and in the Alluvial deposits, which\r\nhave immediately preceded the present epoch.\r\n\r\nWhere then, it may be asked, does the geologist find a chronological\r\nguide to lead him through the vast series of strata which, in the course\r\nof countless ages, have been deposited in the water? How is he able to\r\ndistinguish the boundaries of the various periods of creation? Where are\r\nthe precise indications which enable him to decipher the enigmas which\r\nthe endless feuds of fire and water have written in the annals of our\r\nglobe?\r\n\r\nThe fossil remains of animals and plants wonderfully furnish the\r\nguidance which he needs. The corals and shells, the ferns and conifera,\r\nthe teeth and bones found in the various strata of the earth-rind are\r\nthe landmarks which point out to him his way through the labyrinth of\r\nthe primitive ages of our globe, as the compass directs the mariner over\r\nthe pathless sea. Every leading fossil has its fixed chronological\r\ncharacter, and thus the age of the formation in which it occurs may be\r\nascertained, and its place determined in the geological scale. It would,\r\nhowever, be erroneous to suppose that each successive formation has been\r\nthe seat of a totally distinct creation, and that the organic remains\r\nfound in one particular stratum are separated by an impassable barrier\r\nfrom those which characterise the preceding or following sedimentary\r\ndeposits.\r\n\r\nAs on the surface of the earth or along the shores of the sea, each land\r\nor each coast has not only its peculiar plants or animals, but also\r\nharbours many of the organic forms of the neighbouring countries or\r\nconterminous shores; as the tropical organisations gradually pass into\r\nthose of the temperate zones, and these again merge into those of the\r\npolar regions, so also the stream of life has from the first flowed\r\nuninterruptedly, in gradually changing forms, through every following\r\nage. New genera and species have arisen, and others have disappeared,\r\nsome after a comparatively short duration, others after having outlasted\r\nseveral formations; but every extinct form has but made way for others,\r\nand thus each period has not only witnessed the decay of many previously\r\nflourishing genera and species, but has also marked a new creation.\r\n\r\nNo doubt the numerous local disturbances above mentioned have frequently\r\nbroken the chain of created beings; but a gradual progress from related\r\nto related forms, a continuous development from lower to more highly\r\norganised species, genera, orders, and classes, has from the beginning\r\nbeen the general and constant law of organic life. Universal\r\ndestructions of existing forms, revolutions covering the whole surface\r\nof the earth with ruin, have most assuredly never occurred in the annals\r\nof our globe.\r\n\r\nNor must it be supposed that the whole scale of sedimentary formations\r\nis to be found superimposed in one spot; for as in our times new strata\r\nare chiefly growing at the mouths of rivers, or where submarine currents\r\ndeposit at the bottom of the ocean the fine mud or sand which is\r\nconveyed into the sea by the disintegration of distant mountain chains,\r\nso also from the beginning each stratum could only have been deposited\r\nin similar localities; and while it was slowly increasing, and not\r\nseldom acquiring colossal dimensions in some parts of the globe, others\r\nremained comparatively but little altered, until new oscillatory\r\nmovements produced a change in their former position, and opening new\r\npaths to the rolling waters, here set bounds to the progress of one\r\nformation, and there favoured the deposition of another.\r\n\r\nA complete study of all the various transformations by fire or water\r\nwhich the surface of our earth has undergone would require an elaborate\r\ntreatise of geology, and lies far beyond the scope or the pretensions of\r\na popular volume which is chiefly devoted to the description of caves\r\nand mines. But I should be neglecting some of the most interesting\r\nfeatures of the subterranean world, were I to omit all mention of the\r\nfossils imbedded in its various strata; of its internal heat; of the\r\nupheavals and subsidences which have played so conspicuous a part in the\r\nhistory of the earth-rind, and are still proceeding at the present day;\r\nof the water percolating or flowing beneath the earth’s crust, and\r\nfinally of the volcanoes and earthquakes, which prove to us that the\r\nancient subterranean fires, far from being extinct, are still as\r\npowerful as ever in remodelling its surface.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER II.\r\n                                FOSSILS.\r\n\r\nGeneral Remarks—Eozoon Canadense—Trilobites—Brachiopods—Pterichthys\r\n  Milleri—Oldest Reptiles—Wonderful Preservation of Colour in Petrified\r\n  Shells—Primæval Corals and Sponges—Sea-lilies—Orthoceratites and\r\n  Ammonites—Belemnites—Ichthyosaurus and Plesiosaurus—Pterodactyli—\r\n  Iguanodon—Tertiary Quadrupeds—Dinotherium—Colossochelys Atlas—\r\n  Megatherium—Mylodon—Glyptodon—Mammoth—Mastodon—Sivatherium Giganteum—\r\n  Fossil Ripple-marks, Rain-drops, and Footprints—Harmony has reigned\r\n  from the beginning.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fossil remains of plants and animals, which have successively\r\nflourished, and passed away since the first dawn of organic life, occupy\r\na prominent place among the wonders of the subterranean world. A medal\r\nthat has survived the ruin of empires is no doubt a venerable relic, but\r\nit seems to have been struck but yesterday when compared with a shell or\r\na leaf that has been buried millions of years ago in the drift of the\r\nprimeval ocean, and now serves the geologist as a waymark through the\r\npast epochs of the earth’s history.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AMMONITES HENLEYI (MIDDLE LIAS).]\r\n\r\nIf we examine the condition in which the fossils have been preserved in\r\nthe strata successively deposited on the surface of our globe, we find\r\nthat in general only parts of the original plant or animal have escaped\r\ndestruction, and in these fragments also the primitive substance has\r\noften been replaced by other materials, so that only their form or their\r\nimpression has triumphed over time. While soft and delicate textures\r\nhave either been utterly swept away, or could only be preserved under\r\nthe rarest circumstances (as, for instance, the insects and flowers\r\ninclosed in amber), a greater degree of hardness or solidity naturally\r\ngave a better chance of escaping destruction. Thus among plants the most\r\nfrequent fossil-remains are furnished by stems, roots, branches, fruit-\r\nstones, leaves; and, among animals, by corals, shells, calcareous\r\ncrusts, teeth, scales, and bones. But the few memorials that have thus\r\nsurvived the lapse of ages enable us to form some idea of the multitudes\r\nthat have entirely perished; and the petrified shell of the Ammonite, or\r\nthe jointed arms of the Encrinite, are proofs of the existence of the\r\nworld of tiny beings which served them for their nourishment and have\r\nbeen utterly swept away. If we consider that the number of all the known\r\nspecies of fossil plants hardly amounts to 3,000, while the Flora of the\r\npresent day, as far as it has been examined by systematical botanists,\r\nnumbers at least 250,000 species; that the host of living insects is\r\nprobably still more numerous, although not much more than 1,500 extinct\r\nspecies of this class are known to us; and that, finally, the remains of\r\nall the extinct crustaceous fishes, reptiles, and warm-blooded animals\r\nare far outnumbered by the species actually living—we may form some idea\r\nof the vast multitudes that have left no trace behind, and whose total\r\nloss will for ever confine within narrow limits our knowledge of the\r\npast phases of organic creation. This loss appears still greater when we\r\nconsider the enormous extent of time during which the fossils known to\r\nus have successively existed, and that a part only of the comparatively\r\nsmall number of the orders, genera, and species to which they belong\r\nexisted at one and the same epoch. But as, owing to the hard texture and\r\nmode of life which are so eminently favourable for the preservation of\r\nshells, we have been enabled to collect about 11,000 fossil species, a\r\nnumber not much inferior to that of the molluscs of the present day, we\r\nmay justly conclude that the more perishable forms of life, of which,\r\nconsequently, fewer vestiges have been preserved, were comparatively as\r\nnumerous, and that ever since the first dawn of organic life our earth\r\nhas borne an immense variety of plants and animals.\r\n\r\nThough comparatively but few species have been preserved, yet sometimes\r\nthe accumulation of fossil remains is truly astonishing. In the\r\ncarboniferous strata we not seldom find more than one hundred beds of\r\ncoal interstratified with sandstones, shales, and limestones, and\r\nextending for miles and miles in every direction. How luxuriant must\r\nhave been the growth of the forests that could produce masses such as\r\nthese, and what countless multitudes of herbivorous insects must have\r\nfed upon their foliage or afforded food to carnivorous hordes scarcely\r\nless numerous than themselves! The remains of corals, encrinites, and\r\nshells often form the greater part of whole mountain ranges, and, what\r\nis still more remarkable, mighty strata of limestone or flint are not\r\nseldom almost entirely composed of the aggregated remains of\r\nmicroscopical animals.\r\n\r\nAfter these remarks on fossils in general, I will now briefly point out\r\nsome of the most striking of the species so preserved to us as they\r\nsuccessively appeared upon the stage of life.\r\n\r\nIn the Lower Laurentian Rocks, the most ancient strata known, only one\r\nfossil has hitherto been found. The _Eozoon canadense_, as it has been\r\ncalled, belonged to the Rhizopods, which occupy about the lowest grade\r\nin the scale of animal existence. Its massive skeletons, composed of\r\ninnumerable cells, would seem to have extended themselves over submarine\r\nrocks, their base upwards of twelve inches in width and their thickness\r\nfrom four to six inches. Such is the antiquity of the Eozoon that the\r\ndistance of time which separated it from the Trilobites of the Cambrian\r\nformation may be equal to the vast period which elapsed between these\r\nand the Tertiary ages. In other words, it is beyond our imagination to\r\nconceive.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TRILOBITE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAGNIFIED EYE OF TRILOBITE.]\r\n\r\nIn the next following Cambrian formation we find, besides some zoophytes\r\nand shells, a number of Trilobites, which, however, appear to have been\r\nmost abundant in the Silurian seas, where they probably swarmed as\r\nabundantly as the crabs and shrimps in the waters of the present age.\r\nFew fossils are more curious than these strange crustaceans, which so\r\nwidely differ from their modern relatives. The jointed carapace is\r\ndivided into three lobes, the middle prominent one forming the axis of\r\nthe body, while the lateral ones were free appendages, under which the\r\nsoft membranaceous swimming feet were concealed. Large eyes, resembling\r\nthose of a dragon-fly, projected from the odd crescent-shaped head, and,\r\nbeing composed of many hundred spherical facets, commanded a wide view\r\nof the horizon. Provided with such complicated organs of vision, the\r\nhelpless animal could betimes perceive the approaching enemy, or more\r\neasily espy its prey, consisting, most likely, of the smaller marine\r\nannelides or molluscs. From the structure of these remarkable eyes we\r\nmay conclude that the waters of the old Cambrian or Silurian Ocean were\r\nas limpid as those of the present seas, and that the natural relations\r\nof light to the eye and of the eye to light cannot have greatly changed\r\nsince that period. Many, if not all, of the Trilobites were capable of\r\nrolling themselves up into a ball, like wood-lice; and accordingly it is\r\nfound that in many of them the contour of the head and tail is so\r\nconstructed that they fit accurately when rolled up. Most probably the\r\nTrilobites either swam in an inverted position, the belly upwards, or\r\ncrawled slowly along at the bottom of the shallow coast waters, where\r\nthey lived gregariously in vast numbers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PTERYGOTUS ACUMINATUS (EURYPTERID).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SPIRIFER PRINCEPS (BRACHIOPOD).]\r\n\r\nContemporaneous with the Trilobites were the Eurypterids, which vary\r\nfrom one foot to five or six feet in length. One of the most striking\r\ncharacteristics of this remarkable order of crustaceans is the\r\nformidable pair of pincers with which they were armed. As their whole\r\nstructure shows them to have been active swimmers, they must have made\r\nconsiderable havoc among the smaller fry of the Devonian and Silurian\r\nseas.\r\n\r\nThen also abounded in hundreds of species the Brachiopods, a class of\r\nmolluscs now but feebly represented by a scanty remnant. The greater\r\npart of the interior of the shell, consisting of two unequal valves, is\r\noccupied with branching arms, furnished with cilia, which cause a\r\nconstant current to flow towards the mouth of the mollusc, and thus\r\nprovide for its nourishment. The arms, as in the family of the\r\nSpiriferidæ, are sometimes supported by calcareous skeletons, arranged\r\nlike loops or spirals.\r\n\r\nSome Brachiopods are attached to stones, like oysters; in others the\r\nlarger valve is perforated, and a sinewy kind of foot, passing through\r\nthe aperture, serves as a holdfast to the animal.\r\n\r\nMost of these helpless creatures did not survive the Carboniferous\r\nperiod, but the Terebratulæ, which still have their representatives in\r\nthe modern seas, existed even then, so that their genealogical tree may\r\njustly boast of a very high antiquity.\r\n\r\nThe fishes, of which the oldest known specimen has been found in the\r\nUpper Silurian group (Lower Ludlow), become more frequent in the next\r\nfollowing Devonian epoch, where they appear in a variety of wonderful\r\nforms, widely different from those of the present day. While in nearly\r\nall the existing fishes the scales are flexible, and generally either of\r\na more or less circular form (cycloid), as in the salmon, herring,\r\nroach, &c., or provided with comb-like teeth, projecting from the\r\nposterior margin (ctenoid), as in the sole or perch, the fishes of the\r\nDevonian, Permian, and Carboniferous periods were decked with hard bony\r\nscales, either covered with a brilliant enamel, as in our sturgeons\r\n(ganoid), and arranged in regular rows, the posterior edges of each\r\nslightly overlapping the anterior ones of the next, or irregular in\r\ntheir shape, and separately imbedded in the skin (placoid), as in the\r\nsharks and rays of the present day. With rare exceptions their skeleton\r\nwas cartilaginous; but the less perfect ossification of their bones was\r\namply compensated by the solid texture of their enamelled coat of mail,\r\nwhich afforded them a better protection against enemies and injuries\r\nfrom without than is possessed by any bony-skeletoned fish of our days.\r\nThey were, in fact, comparatively as well prepared for a hostile\r\nencounter as an ancient knight in armour, or as one of our modern iron-\r\nplated war ships. One of the most remarkable of these mail-clad Ganoids\r\nwas the _Pterichthys Milleri_ of the Old Red Sandstone of Scotland. In\r\nmost of our fishes the pectoral fins are but weakly developed; here they\r\nconstitute real arms, moved by strong muscles, and resembling the paddle\r\nof the turtle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PTERICHTHYS MILLERI—RESTORED. (OLD RED SANDSTONE OF\r\nSCOTLAND.)]\r\n\r\nBesides the enormous masses of vegetable matter which distinguish the\r\nCarboniferous period, the stone beds of that formation likewise contain\r\na vast number of animal remains. From the reptiles and fishes down to\r\nthe corals and sponges, many new families, genera, and species crowd\r\nupon the scene, while many of the previously flourishing races have\r\neither entirely disappeared, or are evidently declining. Thus the\r\nTrilobites, formerly so numerous, are reduced to a few species in the\r\nCarboniferous period, and vanish towards its close.\r\n\r\nIn 1847 the oldest known reptiles were found in the coal field of\r\nSaarbrück, in the centre of spheroidal concretions of clay iron-stone,\r\nwhich not only faithfully preserved the skulls, teeth, and the greater\r\nportions of the skeletons of these ancient lizards, but even a large\r\npart of their skin, consisting of long, narrow, wedge-shaped, tile-like,\r\nand horny scales, arranged in rows. What a lesson for human pride! The\r\npyramid of the Pharaoh Cheops, reared by the labour of thousands of\r\nslaves, has been unable to preserve his remains from spoliation even for\r\nthe short space of a few thousand years, and here a vile reptile has\r\nbeen safely imbedded in a sarcophagus of iron ore during the vast period\r\nof many geological formations.\r\n\r\nStill more recently (1854) other wonders have been brought to light in\r\nthe clay iron-stone of Saarbrück. The wing of a grasshopper, with all\r\nits nerves as distinctly marked as if the creature had been hopping\r\nabout but yesterday, some white ants or termites (now confined to the\r\nwarmer regions of the globe), a beetle, and several cockroaches, give us\r\nsome idea of the insects that lived at the time when our coal-beds were\r\nforming. Another highly interesting circumstance, relating to the\r\nfossils of that distant period, is that in several of them the patterns\r\nof their colouring have been preserved. Thus _Terebratula hastata_ often\r\nretains the marks of the original coloured stripes which ornamented the\r\nliving shell. In _Aviculopecten sublobatus_ dark stripes alternate with\r\na light ground, and wavy blotches are displayed in _Pleurotomaria\r\ncarinata_. From these facts Professor Forbes inferred that the depth of\r\nthe seas in which the Mountain Limestone was formed did not exceed fifty\r\nfathoms, as in the existing seas the Testacea, which have shells and\r\nwell-defined patterns, rarely inhabit a greater depth.\r\n\r\nThe Magnesian Limestone or Permian group is remarkable chiefly for the\r\nvast number of fishes that have been found in some of its members, such\r\nas the marl slate of Durham and the Kupferschiefer, or copper slate, of\r\nThuringia. From the curved form of their impressions, as if they had\r\nbeen spasmodically contracted, the fossil fish of the latter locality\r\nare supposed to have perished by a sudden death before they sank down\r\ninto the mud in which they were entombed. Probably the copper which\r\nimpregnates the stratum in which they occur is connected with this\r\nphenomenon. Mighty volcanic eruptions corrupted the water with poisonous\r\nmetallic salts, and destroyed in a short time whole legions of its finny\r\ninhabitants.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VENTRICULITES—FOSSIL SPONGE (CHALK).]\r\n\r\nFrom the earliest ages the corals play a conspicuous part in fossil\r\nhistory; and as in our days we find them encircling islands and fringing\r\ncontinents with huge ramparts of limestone, so many an ancient reef, now\r\nfar inland, and raised several thousand feet above the level of the sea,\r\nbears witness to the vast terrestrial changes that have taken place\r\nsince it was first piled up by the growth of countless zoophytes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SIPHONIA COSTATA—FOSSIL SPONGE (GREEN SAND, WARMINSTER).]\r\n\r\nWith regard to the dimensions of the fossil corals we do not find that\r\nany of them exceeded in size their modern relatives; but their\r\nconstruction was widely different.\r\n\r\nThe fossil sponges of the primitive seas are likewise very unlike those\r\nof the present day.\r\n\r\nThus in all the ancient strata we find abundant spongidæ with a stony\r\nskeleton, while all the modern sponges possess a horny frame. The\r\nPetrospongidæ, or stone sponges, which have long since disappeared, are\r\nfrequently shapeless masses; but a large number are cup-shaped, with a\r\ncentral tubular cavity, lined, as well as the outer surface, with pores\r\nmore or less regularly arranged.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  ENCRINUS LILIIFORMIS.\r\n  (Muschelkalk, Germany.)\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PENTACRINUS BRIAREUS.]\r\n\r\nThe Crinoids, or Sea-lilies, now almost entirely extinct, were extremely\r\ncommon in the primeval seas. Unlike our modern sea-stars, to which they\r\nare allies, they did not move about freely from place to place, but were\r\naffixed, like flowers, to a slender flexible stalk, composed of numerous\r\ncalcareous joints connected together by a fleshy coat. The Carboniferous\r\nMountain Limestone is loaded with their remains, and the _Encrinus\r\nliliiformis_ is one of the leading fossils of the Muschelkalk of the\r\nTriassic group. The _Pentacrinus briareus_ is of more modern date, and\r\noccurs in tangled masses, forming thin beds of considerable extent in\r\nthe Lower Lias. This beautiful Crinoid, with its innumerable tentacular\r\narms, appears to have been frequently attached to the drift wood of the\r\nLiassic sea, like the floating barnacles of the present day. In the\r\nstill more recent Chalk group is found a remarkable form of star-fish,\r\nthe _Marsupites ornatus_, which resembles in all respects the Crinoids,\r\nexcept that it is not and never was provided with a stem. It seems to\r\nhave been rolled lazily to and fro, by the influence of the waves, at\r\nthe bottom of the sea, and to have been anchored in its place by the\r\naction of gravity alone.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MARSUPITES ORNATUS. CHALK.]\r\n\r\nOf all the changes that have taken place in organic life, none perhaps\r\nare more remarkable than the transformations which the Cephalopod\r\nmolluscs have undergone during the various geological eras. In the more\r\nancient Palæozoic seas flourished the Orthoceratites, or straight-\r\nchambered shells, resembling a nautilus uncoiled. In the Carboniferous\r\nages the Goniatites acquired their highest development. These shells\r\nwere spirally wound, having the lobes of the chambers free from lateral\r\ndenticulations or crenatures, so as to form continuous and uninterrupted\r\noutlines.\r\n\r\nBoth Orthoceratites and Goniatites disappear in the Triassic times, and\r\nare replaced by hosts of Ammonites, which successively flourished in\r\nmore than 600 species, and are characterised by an external siphon and\r\nchambers of complicated, often foliated, pattern. This foliated\r\nstructure gives a remarkable character to the intersection of the\r\nchamber partitions with the shell, and must have added greatly to the\r\nstrength of the shell, which was always delicate and often very\r\nbeautiful. The Ammonites, which made their first appearance towards the\r\nend of the Triassic period, abounded in the Oolitic and Cretaceous\r\nperiods, and were replaced by new forms before the Tertiary beds were\r\ndeposited. Among these we find the _Ancyloceras gigas_, which may be\r\nregarded as an Ammonite partially unrolled, and the _Turrilites\r\ntuberculatus_, which has the form and peculiar symmetry of a univalve\r\nshell.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TURRILITES TUBERCULATUS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RESTORED BELEMNITE.]\r\n\r\nIn several of the older rocks, especially the Lias and Oolite,\r\nBelemnites are frequently met with. These singular dart- or arrow-shaped\r\nfossils were supposed by the ancients to be the thunderbolts of Jove,\r\nbut are now known to be the petrified internal bones of a race of\r\nvoracious cuttle-fishes, whose importance in the Oolitic or Cretaceous\r\nSeas may be judged of by the frequency of their remains and the 120\r\nspecies that have been hitherto discovered.\r\n\r\nBelemnites two feet long have been found, so that, to judge by\r\nanalogies, the animals to which they belonged as cuttle-bones must have\r\nmeasured eighteen or twenty feet from end to end. Provided with\r\nprehensile hooks on their long arms, and with a formidable parrot-like\r\nbill, these huge creatures must have proved most dangerous antagonists,\r\neven to the well-protected fishes that lived in the same seas. But of\r\nall the denizens of the Mesozoic Ocean none were more powerful than the\r\nlarge marine or enaliosaurian reptiles, which, flourishing throughout\r\nthe whole of the Triassic period, were lords of all they surveyed down\r\nto the end of the Cretaceous epoch. First among these monsters appears\r\nthe gigantic Ichthyosaurus, which has been found no less than forty feet\r\nlong—a creature half fish, half lizard, and combining, in strange\r\njuxtaposition, the snout of the porpoise, the teeth of the crocodile,\r\nand the paddles of the whale. But the most remarkable of its features is\r\nthe eye, surpassing a man’s head in size, and wonderfully adapted for\r\nvision both far and near.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ICHTHYOSAURUS COMMUNIS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  PLESIOSAURUS DOLICHODEIRUS.\r\n  (British Museum—Found in the Lias of Street, near\r\n  Glastonbury.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn the quarries of Caen in Normandy, at Lyme Regis in Dorsetshire, and\r\nparticularly at Kloster Banz in Franconia, where the largest known\r\nspecimen has been discovered, entire skeletons of the formidable\r\nIchthyosaurus have been exhumed from the Liassic shale—memorials of the\r\nages long since past, when lands now far removed from the ocean still\r\nlay at the bottom of the sea, and formed the domain of gigantic lizards.\r\nThe enormous jaw-bones of the Ichthyosauri, which in the full-grown\r\nanimal could be opened seven feet wide, were armed along their whole\r\nlength with powerful conical teeth, showing them to have been\r\ncarnivorous, and the half-digested remains of fishes and reptiles found\r\nwithin their skeletons indicate the precise nature of their food. The\r\nsize of the swallowed object proves also that the cavity of the stomach\r\nmust have corresponded with the wide opening of the jaws. Thus\r\npowerfully equipped for offensive warfare; excellent swimmers from their\r\ncompressed cuneiform trunk, their long broad paddles, and their stout\r\nvertical tail-fin; provided, moreover, with eyes capable of piercing the\r\ndim light of the ocean depths, they must have been formidable indeed to\r\nthe contemporaneous fishes.\r\n\r\nThe Ichthyosaurus was admirably formed for cleaving the waves of an\r\nagitated sea; but the Plesiosaurus was equally well organised for\r\npursuing its prey in shallow creeks and bays defended from heavy\r\nbreakers. Its long swan-like neck no doubt enabled it to drag many a\r\nvictim from its hiding-place. While these huge lizards were the terror\r\nof the seas, the Pterodactyles, a race of winged lizards, armed with\r\nlong jaws and sharp teeth, hovered in the air. With the exception of the\r\ngreatly elongated fifth finger, to which, as well as to the whole length\r\nof the arm and body, the membranous wing or organ of flight was\r\nattached, the fingers of this strange animal were provided with sharp\r\nclaws, so that it was probably enabled, like the bat, to suspend itself\r\nfrom precipitous rock-walls.\r\n\r\nIt is a remarkable fact, that, whereas the Pterodactyles of the older\r\nLias beds did not exceed ten or twelve inches in length, the later\r\nforms, found fossil in the Greensand and Wealden beds of the Lower\r\nCretaceous formation, must have been at least 16½ feet long. That these\r\nreptiles were not the only vertebrated animals capable of hovering in\r\nthe air at the time when the huge Ichthyosaurus was lord of the seas, is\r\nproved by a bird about the size of a rook, which was discovered in 1862,\r\nin the lithographic slate of Solenhofen in Bavaria, a stone-bed\r\nbelonging to the period of the Upper Oolite. The skeleton of this\r\nvaluable specimen, now in the British Museum, is almost entire, with the\r\nexception of the head, and retains even its feathers. Still older fossil\r\nmammalia have been found near Stuttgard, in the uppermost bed of the\r\nTriassic deposits, and in the Lower Oolite of Oxfordshire. These\r\ninteresting remains, which carry back the existence of the mammals to a\r\nvery remote period, belong to small marsupial, or opossum-like, animals.\r\nThe jaws, which are the principal parts preserved, are exceedingly\r\nminute, and remarkable for the number and distribution of their teeth,\r\nwhich prove them to have been either insectivorous or rodent.\r\n\r\nThe remains of the Ichthyosauri and Plesiosauri occur chiefly in the\r\nLiassic group, but the more recent Cretaceous (Wealden) formation is\r\ndistinguished by the presence of still more enormous land saurians. On\r\ntheir massive legs and unwieldy feet these monsters stood much higher\r\nthan any reptile of our days, and resembled in bulk and stature the\r\nelephants of the present world.\r\n\r\nThe carnivorous Megalosaurus (for its sharply serrated teeth indicate\r\nthis mode of life) appears to have preceded the gigantic Iguanodon,\r\nwhose dentition denotes a vegetable food. Like the giant sloths of South\r\nAmerica—the Megatherium and the Mylodon—the Iguanodon was provided with\r\na long prehensile tongue and fleshy lips to seize the leaves and\r\nbranches on which it fed. Professor Owen estimates its probable length\r\nat between fifty and sixty feet, and to judge by the proportions of its\r\nextremities, and particularly of its huge feet, it must have exceeded\r\nthe bulk of the elephant eightfold.\r\n\r\nDuring the following Upper Cretaceous epoch flourished the Mosasaurus, a\r\nmarine saurian, first discovered in the quarries of St. Peter’s Mount,\r\nnear Maestricht,[1] and supposed to have been twenty-four feet in\r\nlength. But the supremacy of the reptiles was now drawing to its close,\r\nand in the Tertiary period we at length see the Mammalia assume a\r\nprominent place on the scene of life. The oldest of these tertiary\r\nquadrupeds differ so widely from those of the present day as to form\r\ndistinct genera. The Palæotheriums, for instance, of which there are\r\nseventeen species, varying in dimensions from the size of a rhinoceros\r\nto that of a hog, combine in their skeleton many of the characters of\r\nthe tapir, the rhinoceros, and the horse, while the Anoplotheriums,\r\nwhose size varied from that of a hare to that of a dwarf ass, resembled\r\nin some respects the rhinoceros and the horse, and in others the\r\nhippopotamus, the hog, and the camel.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1:\r\n\r\n  Chapter XXXVIII\r\n\r\nIn the Miocene epoch many of these more ancient quadrupeds no longer\r\nappear upon the scene, while others still flourish in its upper period\r\nalong with still existing genera, and with forms long since extinct,\r\nsuch as the Dinotherium. This huge animal is particularly remarkable for\r\nits two large and heavy tusks, placed at the extremity of the lower jaw,\r\nand curved downwards like those in the upper jaw of the walrus. It was\r\nformerly supposed to be an herbivorous cretacean, and to have used its\r\nanterior limbs principally in the act of digging for roots. The remains\r\non which these speculations were founded were the huge jaws and\r\nshoulder-blade discovered at Epplesheim in Hesse Darmstadt; but an\r\nimmense pelvis of the animal, measuring six feet in breadth and four and\r\na quarter feet in height, discovered by Father Sanno Solaro, in the\r\ndepartment of the Haute Garonne, proves that this supposed aquatic\r\npachyderm was a gigantic marsupial, and that the dependent trunks of the\r\nunwieldy animal, instead of serving the purpose of anchoring it to the\r\nbanks of rivers, answered the more homely, but equally important office,\r\nof lifting the young into the maternal pouch. ‘The remarkable history of\r\nthe successive discovery of its bones,’ says Professor Haughton, ‘and\r\nthe change of views consequent thereupon, should teach geologists\r\nmodesty in the expression of their opinion.’ During this period also\r\nflourished in India, along with many other strange forms of life, the\r\nColossochelys Atlas, a tortoise of the most gigantic proportions,\r\nmeasuring, probably, nearly twenty feet on the curve of the carapace,\r\nand dwarfing into insignificance the great Indian tortoise of the\r\npresent day.\r\n\r\nThe nearer we approach our own times, the greater becomes the proportion\r\nof still existing genera and species; and it is remarkable that as early\r\nas the Pliocene epoch we find a geographical distribution of mammalian\r\nlife analogous to that which now characterises the various regions of\r\nthe earth.\r\n\r\nThus the fossil monkeys of South America have the nostrils wide apart\r\nlike all the existing simiæ of the new world, and fossil monkeys with\r\napproximated nostrils, the characteristic mark of all the old world\r\nquadrumana, are exclusively found in Asia and in Europe, where now a\r\nsmall species of monkey is confined to the Rock of Gibraltar, but where,\r\nin the Upper Miocene times, large long-armed apes, equalling man in\r\nstature, lived in the oak forests of France. Thus also South America,\r\nwhere alone sloths and armadilloes exist at the present day, is the only\r\npart of the world where, in the younger tertiary rocks, the remains of\r\nanalogous mammals—the Megatherium, the Mylodon, and the Glyptodon—have\r\nbeen found.\r\n\r\nThe Mylodon was a colossal sloth, eleven feet long and with a\r\ncorresponding girth. When we consider the huge size of the pelvis and\r\nthe massiveness of the limbs, we must needs conclude that Professor Owen\r\ncould not possibly have given the unwieldy animal a more appropriate\r\nsurname than that of _robustus_.\r\n\r\nThe Megatherium was of still larger size. Its length was as much as\r\neighteen feet, the breadth of its pelvis was six feet, and the tail,\r\nwhere it was attached to the body, must have measured six feet in\r\ncircumference. The thigh bone was nearly three times as great as that of\r\nthe largest known elephant, the bones of the instep and those of the\r\nfoot being also of corresponding size. The general proportions both of\r\nthe Megatherium and Mylodon resembled those of the elephant, the body\r\nbeing relatively as large, the legs shorter and thicker, and the neck\r\nvery little longer. The Megatherium may have had a short proboscis, but\r\nthe Mylodon exhibits no mark of such contrivance.\r\n\r\nIt is evident, from the bulk and construction of these huge animals,\r\nthat they did not, like the sloths of the present day, crawl along the\r\nunder side of the boughs till they had reached a commodious feeding\r\nplace, but that, firmly seated on the strong tripod of their two hind\r\nlegs and powerful tail, they uprooted trees or wrenched off branches\r\nwith their fore limbs, which were well adapted for grasping the trunk or\r\nlarger branches of a tree. The long and powerful claws were also, no\r\ndoubt, useful in the preliminary process of scratching away the soil\r\nfrom the roots of the trees to be prostrated. This task accomplished,\r\nthe long and curved fore claws would next be applied to the opposite\r\nsides of the loosened trunk. ‘The tree being thus partly undermined and\r\nfirmly grappled with, the muscles of the trunk, the pelvis, and hind\r\nlimbs, animated by the nervous influence of the unusually large spinal\r\ncord, would combine their forces with those of the anterior members in\r\nthe efforts at prostration. If now we picture to ourselves the massive\r\nframe of the Megatherium, convulsed with the mighty wrestling, every\r\nvibrating fibre reacting upon its bony attachment with a force which the\r\nsharp and strong crests and apophyses loudly bespeak, we may suppose\r\nthat that tree must have been strong indeed which, rocked to and fro, to\r\nright and left, in such an embrace, could long withstand the efforts of\r\nits ponderous assailant.’\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GLYPTODON CLAVIPES.]\r\n\r\nThe Glyptodon, a colossal armadillo of the size of an ox, was covered\r\nwith a thick heavy tessellated bony armour, which, when detached from\r\nthe body, resembled the section of a large cask. This harness measured\r\non its curve from head to tail at least six feet, and four feet from\r\nside to side, so that a Laplander might have squatted comfortably under\r\nits roof.\r\n\r\nIn the superficial deposits of diluvial drift, in Germany and England,\r\nin Italy and Spain, in Northern Asia as well as in North America,\r\nbetween the latitudes of 40° and 75°, the bones of the large extinct\r\nPachyderms have been found, and become more and more abundant as we\r\napproach the ice-bound regions within the Arctic Circle. The Siberian\r\ntundras, and the islands in the Polar Sea beyond, are, above all, so\r\nrich in the fossil remains of the Mammoth, or primitive elephant, that\r\nits tusks form a not unimportant branch of commerce. From the presence\r\nof so large an animal in treeless wilds, where now only small rodents or\r\ntheir persecutors, the Arctic fox and snow owl, find the means of\r\nsubsistence, it has been inferred that Siberia must in those times have\r\nenjoyed a tropical climate; but many weighty arguments have been arrayed\r\nagainst this opinion. The musk-ox, it is well known, prefers the stinted\r\nherbage of the Arctic regions, while the allied buffalo can only thrive\r\nin a warm country, and different species of bears are found in all\r\nzones; so also the primitive elephant was formed for a temperate or cold\r\nclimate. Instead of being naked, like his living Asiatic and African\r\nrelations, the Mammoth was covered with a warm clothing, well fitted to\r\nbrave a low temperature, a fact sufficiently proved by the carcass of\r\none of these animals which was found, in the year 1803, imbedded in a\r\nmass of ice on the bank of the Lena in latitude 70°. Its skin was\r\ncovered first with black bristles, thicker than horse-hair, from twelve\r\nto sixteen inches in length, secondly with hair of a reddish-brown\r\ncolour, about four inches long, and thirdly with wool of the same colour\r\nas the hair, about an inch in length.\r\n\r\nThe discoveries of Middendorff on the banks of the Taymur likewise show\r\nthat in those times the climate of Siberia was by no means tropical, for\r\nin latitude 75° 15′ he found the trunk of a larch imbedded with the\r\nbones of a Mammoth in an alluvial stratum fifteen feet above the level\r\nof the sea. Fragments of pine leaves have likewise been extracted from\r\ncavities in the molar teeth of a fossil rhinoceros, discovered on the\r\nbanks of the Wiljui, in latitude 64°. The numerous land and freshwater\r\nshells accompanying the Mammoth in the highest latitudes are also,\r\nalmost without exception, identical with those now existing in Siberia.\r\n\r\nThe Mastodon, though not uncommon among the fossils of the old world, is\r\nmore abundantly found in North America. The molar teeth of this huge\r\nanimal, whose grinding surfaces had their crowns studded with conical\r\neminences, more or less resembling the teats of a cow, differed greatly\r\nfrom the flat-crowned grinders of the Mammoth; but both had twenty ribs\r\nlike the living elephant, and must have been similar in size and general\r\nappearance. The body of the Mastodon would seem to have been longer, its\r\nlimbs thicker and shorter, and, perhaps, its form, on the whole, rather\r\napproaching that of the hippopotamus, which it probably resembled also\r\nin some of its habits. Its mouth was broader than that of the elephant,\r\nand although it was certainly provided with a long trunk, it must have\r\nlived on soft succulent food, and it seems to have rarely left the\r\nmarshes and muddy ponds, in which it would find ample food.\r\n\r\nThe most complete, and probably the largest, specimen of the Mastodon\r\never found was exhumed in 1845, in the town of Newbury, New York, the\r\nlength of the skeleton being twenty-five feet, and its height twelve\r\nfeet. From another specimen, found in the same year, in Warren County,\r\nNew Jersey, the clay in the interior within the ribs, just where the\r\ncontents of the stomach might naturally have been looked for, furnished\r\nsome bushels of vegetable substance. A microscopic examination proved\r\nthis matter to consist of pieces of small twigs of a coniferous tree of\r\nthe cypress family, probably the young shoots of the white cedar (_Thuja\r\noccidentalis_) which is still a native of North America.\r\n\r\nThis interesting discovery likewise proves that the climate of North\r\nAmerica was then, like that of Siberia, not very different from that of\r\nthe present day.\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable of the fossil Ruminants are found among the deer\r\ntribe. The largest of these is the _Sivatherium giganteum_, discovered\r\nin the Tertiary beds of the sub-Himalayan hills. It was a deer with four\r\nhorns, and, to judge by the size of its bones, must have exceeded the\r\nelephant in its dimensions. Near this huge ‘antlered monarch of the\r\nwaste’ the extinct _Cervus megaceros_, found in the bogs and shallow\r\nmarls of Ireland, appears as a mere dwarf, in spite of its large\r\nbranching palmate horns, often weighing eighty pounds, and a\r\ncorresponding stature far exceeding that of our modern deer.\r\n\r\nThe colossal size of many of the extinct plants and animals might seem\r\nto favour the belief that organic life has degenerated from its former\r\npowers; but a survey of existing creation soon proves the vital\r\nprinciple to be as strong and flourishing as ever.\r\n\r\nNo fossil tree has yet been found to equal the towering height of the\r\nhuge Sequoias and Wellingtonias of California; and though the Horsetails\r\nand Clubmosses of the Carboniferous ages may well be called colossal\r\nwhen compared with their diminutive representatives of the present day,\r\nyet their height by no means exceeded that of the tall bamboo of India.\r\nNo fossil bivalve is as large as the Tridacna of the tropical seas; and\r\nthough our nautilus is a mere pigmy when compared with many of the\r\nAmmonites, our naked cuttlefishes are probably as bulky as those of any\r\nof the former geological formations. The living crustaceans and fishes\r\nare not inferior to their predecessors in size, and though the giant\r\nsaurians of the past were much larger than our crocodiles, yet they do\r\nnot completely dwarf them by comparison. The extinct Dinornis[2] far\r\nsurpassed the ostrich in size, but the Mammoth and the Mastodon find\r\ntheir equal in our elephant; and though the sloths of the present day\r\nare mere pigmies when compared with the Megatherium, yet no extinct\r\nmammal attains the size of the Greenland whale.\r\n\r\nFootnote 2:\r\n\r\n  Chapter XIX.\r\n\r\nThe perfect preservation of so many fossil remains of animals and\r\nplants, which enables us to trace the progress of organic life on earth\r\nfrom one vast epoch to another, is surely wonderful enough; but we must\r\nconsider it as a still greater wonder that phenomena usually so\r\nevanescent as foot-prints, ripple-marks, and rain-prints should in some\r\ncases have been permanently engraved in stone, and appear as distinct\r\nafter millions of years as if their traces had been left but yesterday.\r\nAll these marks were at first printed on soft argillaceous mud, on the\r\nsea-shore, or on the borders of lakes and rivers, which retained them as\r\nthey became dry. Sand or clay having then been drifted into the mould by\r\nthe wind, or deposited in its cavity by the next tide, a permanent cast\r\nwas made, indented in the lower stratum and standing out in relief on\r\nthe upper one.\r\n\r\nThus rain-drops on greenish slates of the Coal period, with several worm\r\ntracks, such as usually accompany rain-marks on the recent mud of modern\r\nbeaches, have been discovered near Sydney, in Cape Breton. As the drops\r\nresemble in their average size those which now fall from the clouds, we\r\nmay presume that the atmosphere of the Carboniferous period corresponded\r\nin density with that now investing the globe, and that different\r\ncurrents of air varied then as now in temperature, so as, by their\r\nmixture, to give rise to the condensation of aqueous vapour.\r\n\r\nIn like manner it has been possible to detect the footprints of\r\nreptiles, even in shales as old as the Cambrian formation, and to follow\r\ntheir trail as they walked or crawled along.\r\n\r\nIn the Upper New Red Sandstone (Lower Trias), near Hildburghausen, in\r\nSaxony, a strange unknown animal, supposed to belong to the frog order,\r\nhas left foot-prints bearing a striking resemblance to the impressions\r\nmade by a human hand; and in the still older red sandstone of\r\nConnecticut, a gigantic bird has marked a foot four times larger than\r\nthat of the ostrich. It existed long before the Ichthyosaurus was seen\r\non earth, and yet by a singular chance its traces, printed on a\r\nfoundation proverbially unstable, have outlived the wreck of so many\r\nages.\r\n\r\nHowever brief and defective the foregoing review of the fossil world may\r\nhave been, it has still sufficed to point out the existence on our\r\nplanet of so many habitable surfaces, each distinct in time, and peopled\r\nwith its peculiar races of aquatic and terrestrial beings, all admirably\r\nfitted for the new states of the globe as they arose, or they would not\r\nhave increased and multiplied and endured for indefinite periods.\r\n\r\n‘The proofs now accumulated,’ says Sir Charles Lyell, ‘of the close\r\nanalogy between extinct and recent species are such as to leave no doubt\r\non the mind that the same harmony of parts and beauty of contrivance\r\nwhich we admire in the living creation has equally characterised the\r\norganic world at remote periods. Thus, as we increase our knowledge of\r\nthe inexhaustible variety displayed in living nature, our admiration is\r\nmultiplied by the reflection that it is only the last of a great series\r\nof pre-existing creations, of which we cannot estimate the number or\r\nlimit in times past.’\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III.\r\n                           SUBTERRANEAN HEAT.\r\n\r\nZone of invariable Temperature—Increasing Temperature of the Earth at a\r\n  greater Depth—Proofs found in Mines and Artesian Wells, in Hot Springs\r\n  and Volcanic Eruptions—The whole Earth probably at one time a fluid\r\n  mass.\r\n\r\n\r\nBorn neither to soar into the air, nor to inhabit the deep waters, nor\r\nto pass his life in subterranean darkness, man is unable to depart to\r\nany considerable distance from the earth’s surface. If he ascends in a\r\nballoon, he soon reaches the limits where the rarefied atmosphere\r\nrenders breathing impossible; a few thousand feet limit his efforts to\r\npierce the earth’s crust; and should he be cast out into the sea, he is\r\nsoon drowned. But beyond the limits to which his body is confined, his\r\nmind soars into space, and plunging into the unknown interior of our\r\nglobe, seeks to unravel the mystery of its formation. In the following\r\npages I purpose briefly to point out the circumstances which guide him\r\nin his speculations, and enable him to roam, at least in spirit, through\r\nthe profound abysses of the subterranean world.\r\n\r\nAs we all know, the temperature of the atmosphere soon communicates its\r\nchanges to the surface of the earth; and our meadows, which when warmed\r\nby the rays of the sun are green and covered with flowers, harden in\r\nwinter into a lifeless plain. But the influence of the sun’s heat upon\r\nthe soil is merely superficial, so that in the temperate zones the\r\nannual fluctuations of the thermometer are no longer perceptible at a\r\ndepth of from 60 to 80 feet.\r\n\r\nThus, in the cellars of the Parisian observatory, a thermometer, placed\r\nmany years ago 86 feet below the surface, invariably indicates +11°7\r\nCelsius; the summer above may be ever so intensely hot, or the winter\r\never so cold, the column of mercury never deviates a hair’s breadth from\r\nthe height it has once attained. Below these limits the warmth of the\r\nearth gradually increases—a fact placed beyond all doubt by the\r\ninnumerable observations that have been made in mines, and during the\r\nboring of Artesian wells. For wherever sinkings have been made, a rising\r\nof the thermometer has always been found to take place as the auger\r\npenetrates to a greater depth below the surface. Thus, to cite but a few\r\nexamples, the temperature of the Artesian well of Grenelle in Paris,\r\nwhich, at a depth of 917 French feet, amounted to +22°2 C., increased at\r\nthe depth of 1,555 feet to +26°43, and the water, which now gashes forth\r\nfrom the depth of 1,684 feet, constantly maintains the same lukewarm\r\ntemperature of +27°70.\r\n\r\nDuring the boring of the well of Neusalzwerk, in Westphalia, the\r\ntemperature rose at the various depths of 580, 1,285, and 1,935 feet\r\nfrom +19°7 C. to +27°5 and +31°4, until, finally, when the depth of\r\n2,144 feet was attained, the saline spring issued forth with a constant\r\ntemperature of +33°6. As from the experience acquired in mines and\r\nArtesian wells, the temperature is found to increase by one degree for\r\nabout every successive 80 or 100 feet, the internal warmth of the earth,\r\nsupposing it to increase in the same proportion towards the centre,\r\nwould, at the depth of 10,000 feet, be equal to that of boiling water,\r\nand at that of 80 or 100 miles sufficiently great to melt the hardest\r\nrock.\r\n\r\nWhether this steady increase really takes place is of course only matter\r\nof conjecture; but the history of hot springs and volcanic eruptions\r\nshows us that everywhere a very high degree of heat exists at\r\nconsiderable depths below the surface.\r\n\r\nMost springs in the temperate zone, without being warm in a remarkable\r\ndegree, still possess a higher temperature than the average warmth of\r\nthe air in the locality where they gush forth, while in the tropical\r\nzone they are frequently cooler—a proof that in both cases they issue\r\nfrom a depth independent of the fluctuating atmospherical influences of\r\nthe surface. While these cool or cold springs, spread in immense numbers\r\nover the earth, attest the existence everywhere of a subterranean source\r\nof heat, the warm and hot springs remind us of its intensity at more\r\nconsiderable depths. These thermal sources are confined to no climate,\r\nfor in the cold land of the Tschuktschi, where the soil must be\r\nperpetually frozen to a depth of several hundred feet, boiling water is\r\nfound to gush forth, as well as in the tropical Feejee Islands.\r\n\r\nThe hot springs, though of frequent occurrence in all parts of the\r\nworld, are not the only or principal vents of subterranean heat. Far\r\ngreater quantities of caloric are constantly pouring forth from the\r\nnumerous volcanoes and solfataras, which are likewise distributed all\r\nover the surface of the globe. The violent convulsions which attend\r\nevery outflow of lava are proofs that these torrents of liquid stone\r\nmust have been forced upwards from a far greater depth than the water of\r\nthe hot springs. The temperature necessary for their production likewise\r\npoints to this fact, for to melt stones a heat of at least 2,000°C. is\r\nrequired. But volcanoes, like hot springs, are found in every zone;\r\nbeyond the Arctic Circle, as well as in the most southern land attained\r\nby Sir James Ross in his memorable voyage. They line the coasts of the\r\nPacific, as well as those of the Sea of Kamtschatka. They desolate\r\nIceland, as they devoured Pompeii and Herculaneum; and everywhere they\r\npour forth the same masses of fluid stone; so that the geologist is not\r\nable to distinguish the lavas of the Andes chain from those of Etna or\r\nVesuvius. But phenomena so much alike in character, common to all parts\r\nof the globe, can hardly be dependent upon mere local circumstances, and\r\nspeak loudly in favour of the theory which supposes our earth to have\r\nbeen at one time a ball of liquid fire. Wandering through space during a\r\ncourse of unnumbered ages, this huge mass of molten stones and metals\r\ngradually cooled, and at length got covered with a solid crust, below\r\nwhich the ancient furnaces are still burning, and striving to burst\r\ntheir fetters. Well may we say with Horace—\r\n\r\n                            ‘_Incedimus_ per ignes\r\n                      Suppositos cineri doloso.’\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IV.\r\n                SUBTERRANEAN UPHEAVALS AND DEPRESSIONS.\r\n\r\nOscillations of the Earth’s Surface taking place in the present day—\r\n  First ascertained in Sweden—Examples of Contemporaneous Upheaval and\r\n  Depression in France and England—Probable Causes of the Phenomenon.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile the sea and the atmospheric ocean are subject to perpetual\r\nfluctuations, and the poet justly compares the uncertain tenure of human\r\nprosperity with the restless wave or the inconstant wind, the solid\r\nearth is generally regarded as the emblem of stability. But an\r\nexamination of the various strata of aqueous origin which constitute by\r\nfar the greater part of the actual dry land soon shows the fallacy of\r\nthis opinion.\r\n\r\nThe fossils of marine origin which occur in so many of our oldest rocks,\r\nnow situated far above the level of the ocean, must necessarily have\r\nbeen raised from the deep. On the towering Andes, fifteen thousand feet\r\nabove the tide-marks of the Pacific, the geologist finds sea-shells\r\nimbedded in the rock, and high above the snow-line the chamois-hunter of\r\nthe Alps wonders at the sight of spirally-wound Ammonites that once\r\nenjoyed life at the bottom of the Liassic Sea. In strata of a more\r\nmodern date, we find, on the banks of the river Senegal, far inland,\r\nlarge deposits of the _Arca senilis_, a mollusc still living on the\r\nneighbouring coast. On the borders of Loch Lomond, twenty feet above the\r\nlevel of the sea, shells of the edible cockle and sea-urchin repose in a\r\nlayer of brown clay, and the banks of the Forth and of the Clyde, thirty\r\nfeet higher than the storm tides, inclose remains of common shells of\r\nthe present period, such as the oyster, the mussel, and the limpet.\r\nAlong the shores of the Mediterranean, at Monte Video and at Valparaiso,\r\nin the isles of the Pacific and at the Cape, in California and Haiti, we\r\nmeet with similar instances of elevation, which, though geologically\r\nrecent, may yet be of a sufficiently ancient date to have preceded the\r\nappearance of man on earth. But proofs are not wanting that the\r\nupheaving power which has wrought so many changes in the past is still\r\nactively employed in remodelling the surface of the earth.\r\n\r\nThis important geological fact was first ascertained on the coast of\r\nSweden, where the peculiar configuration of the shore makes it easy to\r\nappreciate slight changes in the relative level of land and water. For\r\nthe continent is fringed with countless rocky islands, called the\r\n‘skär,’ within which boats and small vessels sail in smooth water even\r\nwhen the sea without is strongly agitated. But the navigation is very\r\nintricate, and the pilot must possess a perfect knowledge of the breadth\r\nand depth of every narrow channel, and the position of innumerable\r\nsunken rocks. On such a coast even a slight change of level could not\r\nfail to become known to the mariner, and to attract the attention of the\r\nlearned, as soon as the book of nature began to be more accurately\r\nstudied.\r\n\r\nEarly in the last century the Swedish naturalist Celsius collected\r\nnumerous observations, all pointing to the fact of a slow elevation of\r\nthe land. Rocks both on the shore of the Baltic and the German Ocean,\r\nknown to have been once sunken reefs, were in his time above water;\r\nsmall islands in the Gulf of Bothnia had been joined to the continent,\r\nand old fishing grounds deserted, as being too shallow or entirely dried\r\nup. These changes of level, which he estimated at about three feet in a\r\ncentury, Celsius attributed to a sinking of the waters of the Baltic,\r\nowing possibly to the channel, by which it discharges its surplus waters\r\ninto the Atlantic, having been gradually widened and deepened by the\r\nwaves and currents. But the lowering of level would in that case have\r\nbeen uniform and universal over that inland sea, and the waters could\r\nnot have sunk at Torneo while they retained their former level at\r\nCopenhagen, Wismar, Stralsund, and other towns which are now as close to\r\nthe water’s edge as at the time of their foundation. Playfair (1802) and\r\nLeopold von Buch (1807) first attributed the change of level to the slow\r\nand insensible rising of the land, and the subsequent investigations of\r\nSir Charles Lyell in 1834 have placed the fact beyond a doubt.\r\n\r\nThe attention of geologists having once been directed to the partial\r\nupheaval of the Scandinavian peninsula, similar facts were soon pointed\r\nout in other countries. At Bourgneuf, near La Rochelle, the remains of a\r\nship wrecked on an oyster bank in the year 1752, now lie in a cultivated\r\nfield, fifteen feet above the level of the sea; and, within a period of\r\ntwenty-five years the parish has gained at least 1,500 acres, a very\r\nacceptable gift of the subterranean plutonic power. Port Bahaud, where\r\nformerly the Dutchmen used to take in cargoes of salt, is now 9,000 feet\r\nfrom the sea, and the Island of Olonne is at present surrounded only by\r\nswamps and meadows. These and similar phenomena, such as the constant\r\nrise of the chalk cliffs at Marennes, cannot possibly be explained by\r\nrecent driftings, but evidently proceed from a slow upheaval of the\r\ncoasts and the adjacent sea-bed.\r\n\r\nOn the opposite shores of the Atlantic, we find Newfoundland undergoing\r\na similar process of elevation; for cliffs over which, thirty or forty\r\nyears ago, schooners used to sail with perfect safety, are now quite\r\nclose to the surface; and in the Pacific the depth of the channel\r\nleading to the port of Honolulu is gradually decreasing from the same\r\ncause.\r\n\r\nWhile many coasts thus show signs of progressive elevation, others\r\nafford no less striking proofs of subsidence, frequently in close\r\nproximity to regions of upheaval.\r\n\r\nThus on the south-west coast of England, in Cornwall, Devon, and\r\nSomerset, submarine forests, consisting of the species still flourishing\r\nin the neighbourhood, are of such frequent occurrence that, according to\r\nSir Henry de la Beche, ‘it is difficult not to find traces of them at\r\nthe mouths of all the numerous valleys which open upon the sea.’\r\nSometimes they are covered with mud or sand, and generally the roots are\r\nfound in the situation where they originally grew, while the trunks have\r\nbeen horizontally levelled. At Bann Bridge, specimens of ancient Roman\r\npottery have been discovered twelve feet below the level of the sea, and\r\nthe remains of an old Roman road, now submerged six feet deep, prove\r\nthat the subsidence of the land has been going on since the times of\r\nJulius Cæsar and Agricola.\r\n\r\nOn the east coast the phenomenon is still more striking, particularly in\r\nthe Wash, that shallow bay between Lincolnshire and Norfolk on whose\r\nopposite shores a submarine forest extends, the trunks and stubbles of\r\nwhich become apparent at ebb-tide. On the coasts of Normandy and\r\nBrittany we likewise find traces of depression, pointing to some future\r\ntime when perhaps many a bluff headland, now boldly fronting the ocean,\r\nmay have disappeared beneath the waves.\r\n\r\nHuts of the Esquimaux and of the early Danish colonists on the coast of\r\nGreenland, now submerged at high tide, could not possibly have been\r\noriginally constructed in so inconvenient a situation; and at Puynipet,\r\nin the South Sea, habitations sunk beneath the water likewise prove a\r\ngradual subsidence of the land.\r\n\r\nOn many coasts and islands modern scientific explorers have hewn marks\r\nin the rock, to enable future generations to judge of the changes which\r\nare slowly but surely altering the configuration of the land and tracing\r\nnew boundaries to the ocean. Had our forefathers left us similar\r\nmemorials, we should know much more about the oscillatory movements of\r\nthe earth-rind than we know now; but, unfortunately, experimental\r\nnatural philosophy is but of recent date, and the marks chiselled out\r\nupon the Swedish rocks in the years 1731 and 1752 are the earliest\r\nrecords by which the chronological progress of elevation or subsidence\r\ncan be distinctly ascertained.\r\n\r\nThis phenomenon, which has played so important a part in the physical\r\nannals of our globe, having once been accurately determined, enables the\r\ngeologist to explain many facts for which, before it became known, it\r\nwas impossible to account.\r\n\r\nWe now need not wonder at seeing sea-shells imbedded in the highest\r\nmountains or buried hundreds of fathoms under the ground, at alternating\r\nlayers of marine and sweet-water deposits being frequently storied one\r\nabove the other, or at originally horizontal strata being now found at\r\nevery possible angle of inclination.\r\n\r\nThe imperceptible slowness with which many of these vast changes are\r\nactually taking place warrants the inference that violent volcanic\r\nrevolutions have no doubt been far less instrumental in moulding the\r\nearth-rind to its present form than the slow oscillatory movements of\r\nelevation and depression which from time immemorial have been constantly\r\naltering its surface.\r\n\r\nThe causes of these oscillatory movements are still very imperfectly\r\nknown, though a probable hypothesis attributes them to the expansion by\r\nincreased temperature of extensive deep-seated masses of matter. As the\r\nelevation of some tracts seems to coincide with the proportionate\r\ndepression of others at a greater or less distance, these alternating\r\nupheavals and subsidences may possibly be the result rather of the\r\nlateral shifting of the flow of heat from one mass of subterranean\r\nmatter to a neighbouring mass than of its positive increase on the\r\nwhole. ‘Such a lateral diversion of the outward flow of heat,’ says Mr.\r\nPoulett Scrope, ‘we may presume to be caused by the deposition over\r\ncertain areas of thick newly-formed beds of any matter imperfectly\r\nconducting heat, like sedimentary sands, gravels, clays, shales, or\r\ncalcareous mud, by which the outward transmission of heat being checked,\r\nit must accumulate beneath, while a portion of it will pass off\r\nlaterally to augment the temperature of mineral matter in neighbouring\r\nareas; just as the water of a spring, if its usual issue is blocked up,\r\nwill accumulate in the fissures or pores of the rock containing it,\r\nuntil it finds a vent on either side and at a higher level. Owing to\r\nthis increase, the resistance opposed by the overlying rocks in that\r\nquarter may be sooner or later overcome, and their elevation brought\r\nabout, through the dilatation of the mineral matter beneath.’\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER V.\r\n                SUBTERRANEAN WATERS AND ARTESIAN WELLS.\r\n\r\nSubterranean Distribution of the Waters—Admirable Provisions of Nature—\r\n  Hydrostatic Laws regulating the Flow of Springs—Thermal Springs—\r\n  Intermittent Springs—The Geysir—Bunsen’s Theory—Artesian Wells—Le\r\n  Puits de Grenelle—Deep Borings—Various Uses of Artesian Wells—Artesian\r\n  Wells in Venice and in the Desert of Sahara.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn every zone the evaporating power of the sun raises from the surface\r\nof the ocean vapours, which hover in the air until, condensed by cold,\r\nthey descend in rain upon the earth. Here part of them are soon restored\r\nto the sea by the swollen rivers; another part is once more volatilised;\r\nbut by far the larger quantity finds its slow way into the bowels of the\r\nearth, where it serves for the perennial supply of wells and springs.\r\n\r\nThe distribution of these subterranean waters, and the simple laws which\r\nregulate their circulation, afford us one of the most interesting\r\nglimpses into the physical economy of our globe. We know that the\r\ngreater part of the earth’s surface is composed of stratified rocks, or\r\nalternate beds of impermeable clay and porous limestone or sand, which\r\nwere originally deposited in horizontal layers, but have since been more\r\nor less displaced and set on edge by upheaving forces. Wherever\r\npermeable beds of limestone or sand crop out on the surface of the land,\r\nthe residuary portions of rain-water which are not disposed of by floods\r\nor by evaporation, must necessarily penetrate into the pores and\r\nfissures, and descend lower and lower, until they finally reach an\r\nimpermeable stratum which forbids their further progress to a greater\r\ndepth.\r\n\r\nThe granite, gneiss, porphyry, lava, and other unstratified and\r\ncrystalline rocks of igneous origin, which cover about a third part of\r\nthe habitable globe, are likewise intersected by innumerable fissures\r\nand interstices, which, in a similar manner, collect and transmit rain-\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nThus the plutonic or volcanic forces which have gradually moulded the\r\ndry land into its present form have also provided it with the necessary\r\nfilters, drains, reservoirs, and conduits, for the constant\r\nreplenishment of springs, brooks, and rivers. As every porous layer is\r\nmore or less saturated with moisture, the stratified rocks are\r\nfrequently traversed at various depths by distinct sheets of water, or\r\nrather, in most cases, by permanently drenched or waterlogged sheets of\r\nchalk or sand. Thus, in a boring undertaken in search of coal at St.\r\nNicolas d’Aliermont, near Dieppe, no less than seven very abundant\r\naquiferous layers or beds of stone were met with from about 75 to 1,000\r\nfeet below the surface. In an Artesian boring at Paris, five distinct\r\nsheets of water, each of them capable of ascension, were ascertained;\r\nand similar perforations executed in the United States, and other\r\ncountries, have in the same manner traversed successive stages of\r\naqueous deposits.\r\n\r\nThus there can be no doubt that vast quantities of water are everywhere\r\naccumulated in the porous strata of which a great part of the\r\nsuperficial earth-rind is composed, the rapidity with which they\r\ncirculate varying of course with the amount of hydrostatic pressure to\r\nwhich they are subjected, and the more or less porous and permeable\r\nnature of the beds through which they percolate. Were the ground we\r\nstand on composed of transparent crystal, and the subterranean water-\r\ncourses tinged with some vivid colour, we should then see the upper\r\nearth-crust traversed in every direction by aqueous veins, and\r\nfrequently as saturated with water as the internal parts of our body are\r\nwith blood. But Nature not only perennially feeds our springs and brooks\r\nfrom the inexhaustible fountains of the deep; it is also one of her\r\ninfinitely wise provisions that the same water which, if placed in casks\r\nor open tanks, becomes putrid, continues fresh so long as it remains in\r\nthe cavities and interstices of the terrestrial strata. While filtering\r\nthrough the earth, it is generally cleansed of all the organic\r\nsubstances whose decay would inevitably taint its purity, and comes\r\nforth salubrious and refreshing, a source of health and enjoyment to the\r\nwhole animal creation.\r\n\r\nThe extreme limits to which the waters descend into the earth of course\r\nescape our direct observation, as the lowest point to which the\r\nsubterranean regions have been probed is less than 2,000 or 2,500 feet\r\nbelow the level of the sea; but as we know from the formation of many\r\nbasins that the strata of which they are composed attain in many cases a\r\nthickness of from 20,000 to 30,000 feet, there can hardly be a doubt\r\nthat they are permeated by water to an equal depth.\r\n\r\nAs steam plays so great a part in volcanic phenomena, the seat or\r\neffective cause of which must needs be sought for at an immense distance\r\nbelow the surface of the earth, we have another proof of the vast depth\r\nto which the subterranean migrations of water are able to attain.\r\n\r\nAfter this brief glimpse into the reservoirs of the deep, we have to\r\nascertain the power which raises their liquid contents and forces them\r\nto reappear upon the surface of the earth. If we pour water into a tube,\r\nbent in the form of the letter U, it will rise to an equal level in both\r\nbranches. We will now suppose that the left branch of the tube opens at\r\nthe top into a vast reservoir, which is able to keep it constantly\r\nfilled, and that the right branch is cut off near the bottom, so that\r\nonly a small vertical piece remains. The pressure of the water column in\r\nthe left branch will in this case force the liquid to gush out of the\r\norifice of the shortened right branch to the level which it occupied\r\nwhile the branch was still entire.\r\n\r\nThese two hydrostatic laws, or rather these two modifications of the\r\nsame law, have been frequently put to practical uses, as, for instance,\r\nin the communicating tubes which distribute the waters of an elevated\r\nsource or reservoir to the various districts of a town, or in the\r\nsubterranean conduits which serve to create fountains, such as those of\r\nVersailles or the Crystal Palace.\r\n\r\nWhen the Romans intended to lead water from one hill to another, they\r\nconstructed, at a vast expense, magnificent aqueducts across the\r\nintermediate valley; but the Turks, whom we look upon as ignorant\r\nbarbarians, obtain the same result in a much more economical manner, and\r\nin this respect far surpass the ancients, who, had they been better\r\nacquainted with the first principles of hydrostatics, would indeed have\r\nleft us fewer specimens of their architectural skill, but would at the\r\nsame time have saved themselves a great deal of unnecessary expense.\r\n\r\nDown the slope of the hill from which the water is to be conducted, the\r\nTurks lay a tube of brick or metal, which, crossing the valley, moulds\r\nitself to its different inflections, and ultimately ascends the\r\ndeclivity of the hill on the opposite side, where, in virtue of the law\r\nabove cited, the water rises as high as on that from which it descended.\r\nIf we suppose the descending branch of the tube to be prolonged only as\r\nfar as the level of the valley, with a superficial orifice, then the\r\nliquid will of course gush forth in a vertical column, and form a _jet\r\nd’eau_, or fountain, its height being determined by the elevation of the\r\nsheet of water by which it is fed, and the consequent degree of pressure\r\nwhich acts upon it. This is the principle on which all artificial\r\nfountains are constructed. The conduit, for instance, which feeds the\r\ngrand fountain of the Tuileries receives its water from a reservoir\r\nsituated on the heights of Chaillot.\r\n\r\nWhatever the form of the tube may be in which the liquid is contained,\r\nthe simple hydrostatic law which regulates its level remains unmodified.\r\nLet the tube be circular, elliptic, or square, with a single orifice or\r\nwith many—let it be open or choked with pebbles or permeable sand—in\r\nevery case the water will invariably rise to the same height, provided\r\nthe tube be perfectly water-tight; or else gush forth wherever it finds\r\nan opening below the highest level.\r\n\r\nThis hydrostatic principle so perfectly illustrates the origin of\r\nsprings, that it is almost superfluous to enter into any further details\r\non the subject.\r\n\r\nWhen we consider that porous or absorbent strata, alternating with\r\nimpermeable strata, frequently crop out on the back or on the slope of\r\nhills or mountains, and then, having reached their base, extend\r\nhorizontally beneath the plain, there can be no doubt that they are\r\nplaced in the same hydrostatic conditions as ordinary water-conducting\r\ntubes, and that wherever any fissure or opening occurs in the\r\nsuperincumbent impervious strata at any point below the highest level of\r\nthe water, springs must necessarily be formed.\r\n\r\nAs the same strata often extend over many hundreds of miles, we cannot\r\nwonder that sources frequently issue from the centre of immense plains,\r\nfor the hydrostatic pressure which causes them to gush forth may have\r\nits seat at a very considerable distance.\r\n\r\nAs the waters by which the springs are fed have often vast subterranean\r\njourneys to perform, their temperature is naturally independent of that\r\nof the seasons or of the changes of the atmosphere. Thus, cold springs\r\noccur in a tropical climate, when their subterranean channels descend\r\nfrom high mountains, and boiling sources gush forth in the Arctic\r\nregions when forced upwards from a considerable depth.\r\n\r\nWhile the waters filter through the earth, they also naturally dissolve\r\na variety of substances, and hence all springs are more or less\r\nimpregnated with extraneous particles. But many of them, particularly\r\nsuch as are of a higher temperature, contain either a larger quantity or\r\nso peculiar a combination of mineral substances as to acquire medicinal\r\nvirtues of the highest order.\r\n\r\nThe geological phenomena which favour the production of thermal springs\r\nare extremely interesting, and point to a deep-seated origin. By far the\r\ngreater number of these fountains arise near the scene of some great\r\nsubterranean disturbance, either connected with volcanic action, or with\r\nthe elevation of a chain of mountains, or lastly by cliffs and fissures\r\ncaused by disruption. Thus the thermal springs of Matlock and Bath\r\naccompany great natural fissures in the mountain limestone, and the hot\r\nsprings of Wiesbaden and Ems, of Carlsbad and Toeplitz, all lie\r\ncontiguous to remarkable dislocations, or to great lines of elevation,\r\nor to the neighbourhood of a volcanic focus.\r\n\r\nOne of the most remarkable phenomena of thermal springs is the constant\r\ninvariableness of their temperature and their mineral impregnation.\r\nDuring the last fifty or sixty years, ever since accurate thermometrical\r\nobservations and chemical analyses have been made, the most celebrated\r\nmineral sources of Germany have been found to contain the same\r\nproportion of mineral substances. This is truly astonishing when we\r\nconsider that the latter are merely dissolved by the waters while\r\npassing through the bowels of the earth, and that a considerable number\r\nof them are frequently found together in the same source.\r\n\r\nAnother remarkable fact is, that, even in countries exposed to violent\r\nand frequent earthquakes, so many subterranean watercourses have\r\nremained unaltered for 2,000 years at least. The sources of Greece still\r\nflow apparently as in the times of Hellenic antiquity. The spring of\r\nErasinos, two leagues south of Argos, on the declivity of the Chaonian\r\nmountains, is mentioned by Herodotus. At Delphi the Cassotis (now Wells\r\nof Saint Nicholas) still flow under the ruins of the temple of Apollo,\r\nand the hot baths of Aidepsos still exist in which Sylla bathed during\r\nthe Mithridatic war.\r\n\r\nMany springs exhibit the singular phenomenon of an intermittence which\r\nis independent of the quantity of rain falling in the district, or of\r\nthe flux and reflux of the tide in a neighbouring river. In many cases\r\nthe simple and well-known hydrostatical law exemplified in the common\r\nsiphon[3] affords a very ready and sufficient explanation of the\r\nphenomenon.\r\n\r\nFootnote 3:\r\n\r\n  A siphon, as is well known, is a bent tube, having one leg longer than\r\n  the other. When this tube is filled with any liquid, and the shorter\r\n  end is immersed in a vessel containing liquid of the same kind, the\r\n  weight of the column in the longer leg will cause the liquid to begin\r\n  to run out, and it will continue running till the vessel is emptied.\r\n  This arises from the pressure of air on the exposed surface of fluid,\r\n  forcing it up through the tube to prevent vacuum, which would\r\n  otherwise be formed at the highest point; and the extreme limit of\r\n  length at which the siphon will act is therefore determined by the\r\n  height of a column of the fluid equal to the pressure of the\r\n  atmosphere (fifteen pounds on the square inch). The limit in the case\r\n  of water is something more than thirty feet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: siphon]\r\n\r\nIn the annexed diagram the vessel _a_ communicates, by a tube _c_, with\r\nthe siphon tube _b_, and it is manifest that when the water in a rises\r\nabove the level of the top of _b_, it will begin to flow over and\r\nescape, as at _d_. But as soon as this is the case the tube _b_ begins\r\nto act as a siphon, and draws off all the water in _a_, so that if a\r\nconstant supply is poured into _a_, but at a rate slower than the rate\r\nof the discharge at _d_, there will be an intermittent discharge, the\r\ninterval depending on the relation of the rate of filling to that of\r\nemptying.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SECTION OF AN INTERMITTENT SPRING.]\r\n\r\nThe case of a subterranean cavity in a limestone rock, slowly fed by\r\ndrainage from the cracks and fissures of the rock above, and\r\ncommunicating at a distant point with the surface by a bent or siphon\r\ntube, is evidently strictly analogous.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GEYSIRS OF ICELAND.]\r\n\r\nIceland, pre-eminently the land of volcanic wonders, possesses in the\r\nGreat Geysir the most remarkable intermittent fountain in the world. ‘At\r\nthe foot of the Laugarfjall hill, in a green plain, through which\r\nseveral rivers meander like threads of silver, and where chains of dark-\r\ncoloured mountains, overtopped here and there by distant snow-peaks,\r\nform a grand but melancholy picture, dense volumes of steam indicate\r\nfrom afar the site of a whole system of thermal springs congregated on a\r\nsmall piece of ground not exceeding twelve acres in extent. In any other\r\nspot the smallest of these boiling fountains would arrest the\r\ntraveller’s attention, but here his whole mind is absorbed by the Great\r\nGeysir. In the course of countless ages, this monarch of springs has\r\nformed out of the silica which it deposits a mound which rises to about\r\nthirty feet above the general surface of the plain, and slopes on all\r\nsides, to the distance of a hundred feet or thereabouts, from the border\r\nof a large circular basin situated in its centre, and measuring about\r\nfifty-six feet in the greatest diameter and fifty-two feet in the\r\nnarrowest. In the middle of this basin, forming as it were a gigantic\r\nfunnel, there is a pipe or tube, which at its opening in the basin is\r\neighteen or sixteen feet in diameter, but narrows considerably at a\r\nlittle distance from the mouth, and then appears to be not more than ten\r\nor twelve feet in diameter. It has been probed to a depth of seventy\r\nfeet, but it is more than probable that hidden channels ramify further\r\ninto the bowels of the earth. The sides of the tube are smoothly\r\npolished, and so hard that it is not possible to strike off a piece of\r\nit with a hammer. Generally the whole basin is found filled up to the\r\nbrim with sea-green water as pure as crystal, and of a temperature of\r\nfrom 180° to 190°. Astonished at the placid tranquillity of the pool,\r\nthe traveller can hardly believe that he is really standing on the brink\r\nof the far-famed Geysir; but suddenly a subterranean thunder is heard,\r\nthe ground trembles under his feet, the water in the basin begins to\r\nsimmer, and large bubbles of steam rise from the tube and burst on\r\nreaching the surface, throwing up small jets of spray to the height of\r\nseveral feet. Every instant he expects to witness the grand spectacle\r\nwhich has chiefly induced him to visit this northern land; but soon the\r\nbasin becomes tranquil as before, and the dense vapours produced by the\r\nebullition are wafted away by the breeze. These smaller eruptions are\r\nregularly repeated every eighty or ninety minutes, but frequently the\r\ntraveller is obliged to wait a whole day or even longer before he sees\r\nthe whole power of the Geysir. A detonation louder than usual precedes\r\none of these grand eruptions; the water in the basin is violently\r\nagitated; the tube boils vehemently; and suddenly a magnificent column\r\nof water, clothed in vapour of a dazzling whiteness, shoots up into the\r\nair with immense impetuosity, to the height of eighty or ninety feet,\r\nand, radiating at its apex, showers water and steam in every direction.\r\nA second eruption and a third rapidly follow, and after a few minutes\r\nthe fairy spectacle has passed away like a fantastic vision. The basin\r\nis now completely dried up, and on looking down into the shaft, the\r\ntraveller is astonished to see the water about six feet from the rim,\r\nand as tranquil as in an ordinary well. After about thirty or forty\r\nminutes it again begins to rise, and after a few hours reaches the brim\r\nof the basin. Soon the subterranean thunder, the shaking of the ground,\r\nthe simmering above the tube begin again—a new gigantic explosion takes\r\nplace, to be followed by a new period of rest—and thus this wonderful\r\nplay of nature goes on, day after day, year after year, and century\r\nafter century. The mound of the Geysir bears witness to its immense\r\nantiquity, as its water contains but a minute portion of silica.’[4]\r\n\r\nFootnote 4:\r\n\r\n  ‘The Polar World,’ p. 54.\r\n\r\nThe explanation of these wonderful phenomena has exercised the ingenuity\r\nof many natural philosophers; but Professor Bunsen’s theory seems the\r\nmost plausible. Having first ascertained, by experiment, that the water\r\nat the mouth of the tube has a temperature, corresponding to the\r\npressure of the atmosphere, of about 212° F., he found it much hotter at\r\na certain depth below; a thermometer, suspended by a string in the pipe,\r\nrising to 266° F., or no less than 48° above the boiling point. By\r\nletting down stones, suspended by strings, to various depths, he next\r\ncame to the conclusion that the tube itself is the main seat or focus of\r\nthe mechanical power which forces the huge water column upwards. For the\r\nstones which were sunk, to greater distances from the surface were not\r\ncast up again when the next eruption of the Geysir took place, whereas\r\nthose nearer the mouth of the tube were ejected to a considerable height\r\nby the ascending water-column. Other experiments also were made, tending\r\nto demonstrate the singular fact that there is often scarcely any motion\r\nbelow when a violent rush of steam and water is taking place above. It\r\nseems that when a lofty column of water possesses a temperature\r\nincreasing with the depth, any slight ebullition, or disturbance of\r\nequilibrium, in the upper portion may first force up water into the\r\nbasin, and then cause it to flow over the edge. A lower portion, thus\r\nsuddenly relieved of part of its pressure, expands, and is converted\r\ninto vapour more rapidly than the first, owing to its greater heat. This\r\nallows the next subjacent stratum, which is much hotter, to rise and\r\nflash into a gaseous form; and this process goes on till the ebullition\r\nhas descended from the middle to near the bottom of the funnel.[5]\r\n\r\nFootnote 5:\r\n\r\n  Liebig’s ‘Annalen,’ translated in ‘Reports and Memoirs of the\r\n  Cavendish Society,’ London, 1848, p. 351.\r\n\r\nIn many geological basins, the deep subterranean waters are frequently\r\ninclosed over a surface of many square miles between impermeable beds of\r\nclay or hard rock, which nowhere permit them to escape; but if a hole be\r\nbored deep enough to reach a permeable bed, it is evident that they will\r\nthen gush forth more or less violently, according to the degree of\r\nhydrostatic pressure which acts upon them. This is the simple theory of\r\nthe Artesian Wells, so called from the French province of Artois, where,\r\nas far back as the beginning of the twelfth century, springs of water\r\nwere artificially obtained by perforating the soil to a certain depth in\r\nplaces where no indication of springs existed at the surface. The\r\nbarbarous inhabitants of the Sahara seem, however, to have long preceded\r\nthe Artesians in the art of sinking deep wells, for Olympiodorus, a\r\nwriter who flourished at Alexandria about the middle of the sixth\r\ncentury, mentions pits sunk in the oasis to the depth of 200 or 300\r\nyards, and pouring forth streams of water, used for irrigation.\r\n\r\nBy the aid of geological science, and of greater mechanical skill,\r\nArtesian borings[6] are at present frequently undertaken in civilised\r\ncountries, wherever the nature of the ground promises success, and the\r\nwant of water is sufficiently great to warrant the attempt. Sometimes\r\nthe water is reached at a moderate distance from the surface, but not\r\nseldom it has been found necessary to bore to a depth of 200 or 300\r\nfathoms. Often efforts, even on this large scale, have proved vain, and\r\nthe work has been abandoned in despair.\r\n\r\nFootnote 6:\r\n\r\n  See Chapter on Mines in general, for a short account of earth-boring\r\n  operations.\r\n\r\nOne of the most remarkable instances on record of a successful sinking\r\nfor water is that of the Artesian well of Grenelle, one of the Parisian\r\nsuburbs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: POROUS STRATA. ARTESIAN WELL SUNK IN THE LONDON BASIN.]\r\n\r\nThe work was begun with an auger of about a foot in diameter, and the\r\nborings showed successively the alluvial soil and subsoil, and the\r\ntertiary sands, gravels, clays, lignite, &c., until the chalk was\r\nreached. The work was then carried on regularly through the hard upper\r\nchalk down to the lower chalk with green grains, the dimension of the\r\nauger being reduced at 500 feet to a nine-inch, and at 1,300 feet to a\r\nsix-inch aperture. When the calculated depth of 1,500 feet had been\r\nreached, and as yet no result appeared, the Government began to be\r\ndisheartened. Still, upon the urgent representations of the celebrated\r\nArago, the sinking was continued, until at length, at the depth of 1,800\r\nfeet, the auger, after a violent shock which made the ground tremble,\r\nsuddenly turned without an effort. ‘Either the auger is broken, or we\r\nhave gained our end,’ exclaimed the director of the work; and a few\r\nmoments after, a large column of water gushed out of the orifice. It\r\ntook more than seven years to accomplish this grand work (1833–41),\r\nwhich was retarded by numberless difficulties and accidents. About half-\r\na-million gallons of perfectly limpid water of a temperature of 82°\r\nFahr. are daily supplied by the Puits de Grenelle, and amply repay its\r\ncost (362,432 fr. 65 centimes = 14,500_l._).\r\n\r\nThe high temperature of Artesian springs, when rising from considerable\r\ndepths, has been turned to various practical uses. Thus, near Canstadt,\r\nin Wurtemberg, several mills are kept in work, during the severest cold\r\nof winter, by means of the warm water of Artesian wells which has been\r\nturned into the mill-ponds, and at Heilbronn several proprietors save\r\nthe expense of fuel by leading Artesian water in pipes through their\r\ngreen-houses. In some localities the pure and constantly temperate\r\nArtesian waters are made use of for the cultivation of cress. The\r\nvigorous growth of this salutary herb in the beds of rivulets, where\r\nnatural springs gush forth, gave the idea of this application, which is\r\nso profitable that the cress nurseries of Erfurt yield a produce of\r\n12,000_l_. a year. Fish ponds have also been improved by such warm\r\nsprings being passed through them.\r\n\r\nAmong the localities benefited by the boring of Artesian wells, Venice\r\ndeserves to be particularly noticed. Formerly the City of the Doges had\r\nno other supply of water but that which was conveyed by boats from the\r\nBrenta, or obtained from the rain collected in cisterns. Hence the joy\r\nof the inhabitants may be imagined, when, in 1846, an Artesian boring in\r\nthe Piazza San Paolo began to disgorge its water at the rate of forty\r\ngallons per minute, and when other undertakings of the same kind proved\r\nequally successful.\r\n\r\nWherever a well gushes forth in the Sahara, it brings life into the\r\nwilderness; the date-tree flourishes as far as its fertilising waters\r\nextend, and the wandering Arab changes into a sedentary cultivator of\r\nthe soil. Thus the boring of Artesian wells on the desert confines of\r\nSouth Algeria has been the means of wonderful improvement, and if the\r\nFrench have too often marked their dominion in Africa by a barbarous\r\noppression of the Arabs, they, in this respect at least, appear in the\r\nmore amiable light of public benefactors.\r\n\r\nA boring apparatus was first landed at Philippeville in April 1856, and\r\nconveyed with immense difficulty to the Oasis Wad Rir at Tamerna. The\r\nwork was begun in May, and on the 19th of June, a spring, to which the\r\ngrateful inhabitants gave the name of the ‘Well of Peace,’ gushed forth.\r\nSoon after another source was tapped at Tamelhat, in the Oasis Temacen,\r\nand received the name of the ‘Well of God’s blessing.’\r\n\r\nThe beneficent instrument of abundance was now conveyed to the Oasis\r\nSidi Rasched, fifteen miles beyond Tuggurt. Here the auger had scarcely\r\nreached a depth of 120 feet when a perfect stream gushed forth, which,\r\naccording to the praiseworthy Arab custom, received the name of the\r\n‘Well of Thanks.’ The opening of this wonderful source gave rise to many\r\ntouching scenes. The Arabs came in throngs to witness the joyful\r\nspectacle: each of them poured some of the water over his head, and the\r\nmothers bathed their children in the gushing flood. An old scheik,\r\nunable to conceal his emotion, fell down upon his knees, and shedding\r\ntears of joy, fervently thanked God for having allowed him to witness\r\nsuch a day.\r\n\r\nThe next triumph was the boring of four wells in the desert of Morran,\r\nwhere previously no spring had existed. In the full expectation of\r\nsuccess, everything had been prepared to turn this new source of wealth\r\nto immediate use, and part of a nomadic tribe instantly settled on the\r\nspot, and planted 1,200 date-trees. A dreary solitude was changed, as if\r\nby magic, into a scene of busy life.\r\n\r\nThese few examples suffice to show the vast services which Artesian\r\nwells are destined at some future time to render to many of the arid\r\nregions of Africa. Both in the Sahara and in the basin-shaped deserts,\r\nwhich extend, under various names, from the Cape Colony to the\r\nneighbourhood of Lake Ngami, there are, beyond all doubt, numberless\r\nspots where water, the fertilising element, may be extracted from the\r\nbowels of the earth.\r\n\r\nIn the droughty plains of Australia also a vast sphere of utility is\r\nreserved to the Artesian wells. Here, also, they will subdue the desert,\r\nunite one coast to another by creating stations in the wilderness, and,\r\nwith every new source which they call to life, promote both material\r\nprogress and intellectual improvement.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MIDDLE AND VALLEY LAKE CRATERS, MOUNT GAMBIER, SOUTH\r\nAUSTRALIA.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VI.\r\n                               VOLCANOES.\r\n\r\nVolcanic Mountains—Extinct and Active Craters—Their Size—Dangerous\r\n  Crater-explorations—Dr. Judd in the Kilauea Pit—Extinct Craters—Their\r\n  Beauty—The Crater of Mount Vultur in Apulia—Volcanoes still constantly\r\n  forming—Jorullo and Isalco—Submarine Volcanoes—Sabrina and Graham’s\r\n  Island—Santorin—Number of Volcanoes—Their Distribution—Volcanoes in a\r\n  constant state of eruption—Stromboli—Fumaroles—The Lava Lakes in\r\n  Kilauea—Volcanic Paroxysms—Column of Smoke and Ashes—Detonations—\r\n  Explosion of Cones—Disastrous Effects of Showers of Ashes and Lapilli—\r\n  Mud Streams—Fish disgorged from Volcanic Caverns—Eruption of Lava—\r\n  Parasitic Cones—Phenomena attending the Flow of a Lava Stream—Baron\r\n  Papalardo—Meeting of Lava and Water—Scoriæ—Lava and Ice—Vast\r\n  Dimensions of several Lava Streams—Scenes of Desolation—Volcanoes\r\n  considered as safety-valves—Probable Causes of Volcanoes.\r\n\r\n\r\nVolcanoes are vents which either have communicated, or still\r\ncommunicate, by one or several chimney-like canals or shafts, with a\r\nfocus of subterranean fire, emitting, or having once emitted, heated\r\nmatter in a solid, semi-liquid, or gaseous state. The first eruption of\r\na volcano necessarily leaves a mound of scoriæ and lava, while numerous\r\neruptions at length raise mountains, which are frequently of an amazing\r\nextent and height. These mountains, which are generally called\r\nvolcanoes, though in reality they are but an effect of volcanic action\r\nsituated far beneath their base, are called _extinct_ when for many\r\ncenturies they have exhibited no signs of combustion—_active_, when,\r\neither perpetually or from time to time, eruptions or exhalations of\r\nlava, scoriæ, or gases take place from their summits, or from vents in\r\ntheir sides. Their shape is generally that of a more or less truncated\r\ncone; but while some, like Cotopaxi or the Peak of Teneriffe, rise with\r\nabrupt declivities in the shape of a sugar-loaf, others, like Mauna Loa\r\nin the island of Hawaii, gradually, and almost imperceptibly, ascend\r\nfrom a vast base embracing many miles in circuit.\r\n\r\nTheir heights also vary greatly. While some, like Madana in Santa Cruz,\r\nor Djebel Teir on the coast of the Red Sea, scarcely raise their summits\r\na few hundred feet above the level of the ocean, others, like\r\nChuquibamba (21,000 feet), or Aconcagua (22,434 feet), hold a\r\nconspicuous rank among mountains of the first class.\r\n\r\nThe summit of a volcano generally terminates in a central cavity or\r\ncrater, where the eruptive channel finds its vent. Craters are sometimes\r\nregularly funnel-shaped, descending with slanting sides to the eruptive\r\nmouth, but more commonly they are surrounded with high precipitous rock-\r\nwalls, while their bottom forms a plain, which is frequently completely\r\nhorizontal, and sometimes of a considerable extent. Its surface is rough\r\nand uneven, from the mounds of volcanic sand, of scoriæ, or of hardened\r\nlava with which it is covered, and generally exhibits a scene of\r\ndreadful desolation, rendered still more impressive by the steam and\r\nsmoke, which, as long as the volcano continues in an active state, issue\r\nfrom its crevices.\r\n\r\nWithin this plain, the eruptive orifice or mouth of the volcano is\r\nalmost universally surrounded by an elevation, composed of ejected\r\nfragments of scoriæ thrown from the vent. Such cones are forming\r\nconstantly at Vesuvius, one being no sooner destroyed by any great\r\neruption, before another begins to take shape and is enlarged, till\r\noften it reaches a height of several hundred feet.\r\n\r\nThus the crater of an active volcano is the scene of perpetual change—of\r\na continual construction and re-construction, and the sands of the sea\r\ndo not afford a more striking image of inconstancy.\r\n\r\nThe various craters are of very different dimensions. While the chief\r\ncrater of Stromboli has a diameter of only fifty feet, that of Gunong\r\nTenger, in Java, measures four miles from end to end; and, though the\r\ndepth of a crater rarely exceeds 1,000 or 1,500 feet, the spectator,\r\nstanding on the brink of the great crater of Popocatepetl, looks down\r\ninto a gulf of 8,000 feet.\r\n\r\nFrom the colossal dimensions of the larger craters, it may well be\r\nimagined that their aspect exhibits some of the sublimest though most\r\ngloomy scenery in nature—the picture of old Chaos with all its horrors.\r\n\r\nThe volcano Gunong Tjerimai, in Java, which rises to the height of 9,000\r\nfeet, is covered with a dense vegetation up to the crater’s brink. On\r\nemerging from the thicket, the wanderer suddenly stands on the verge of\r\nan immense excavation encircled with naked rocks. He is obliged to hold\r\nhimself by the branches of trees, or to stretch himself flat upon the\r\nground, so as to be able to look down into the yawning gulf. The deep\r\nand inaccessible bottom of the crater loses itself in misty obscurity,\r\nand glimmers indistinctly through the vapours which are there slowly and\r\nincessantly ascending from its mysterious depths. All is desolate and\r\nsilent, save when a solitary falcon, hovering over the vast chasm,\r\nawakes with her discordant screech the echoes of the precipice. Through\r\na telescope may be seen, in various parts of the huge crater walls,\r\nswarms of small swallows, which have there built their nests, flying\r\nbackwards and forwards. The eye can detect no other signs of life, the\r\near distinguish no other sound.\r\n\r\nHumboldt describes the view down the crater of the Rucu-Pichincha—a\r\nvolcano which towers above the town of Quito to a height of 15,000 feet—\r\nas the grandest he ever beheld during all his long wanderings. Guided by\r\nan Indian, he ascended the mountain in 1802, and after scaling, with\r\ngreat difficulty and no small danger, its steep and rocky sides, he at\r\nlength looked down upon the black and dismal abyss, whence clouds of\r\nsulphurous vapour were rising as from the gates of hell.\r\n\r\nThe descent into the crater of an active volcano is at all times a\r\ndifficult and hazardous enterprise, both from the steepness of its\r\nencircling rock walls, and the suffocating vapours rising from its\r\nbottom; but it is rare indeed that a traveller has either the temerity\r\nor the good fortune to penetrate as far as the very mouth of the\r\neruptive channel, and to gain a glimpse of its mysterious horrors. When\r\nM. Houel visited Mount Etna in 1769, he ventured to scale the cone of\r\nstones and ashes which had been thrown up in the centre of the crater,\r\nwhere thirty years before there was only a prodigious chasm or gulf. On\r\nascending this mound, which emitted smoke from every pore, the\r\nadventurous traveller sunk about mid-leg at every step, and was in\r\nconstant terror of being swallowed up. At last, when the summit was\r\nreached, the looseness of the soil obliged him to throw himself down\r\nflat upon the ground, that so he might be in less danger of sinking,\r\nwhile at the same time the sulphurous exhalations arising from the\r\nfunnel-shaped cavity threatened suffocation, and so irritated his lungs\r\nas to produce a very troublesome and incessant cough. In this posture\r\nthe traveller viewed the wide unfathomable gulf in the middle of the\r\ncrater, but could discover nothing except a cloud of smoke, which issued\r\nfrom a number of small apertures scattered all around. From time to time\r\ndreadful sounds issued from the bowels of the volcano, as if the roar of\r\nartillery were rebellowed throughout all the hollows of the mountain.\r\nThey were no doubt occasioned by the explosions of pent-up gases\r\nstriking against the sides of these immense caverns, and multiplied by\r\ntheir echoes in an extraordinary manner. After the first unavoidable\r\nimpression of terror had been overcome, nothing could be more sublime\r\nthan these awful sounds, which seemed like a warning of Etna not to pry\r\ntoo deeply into his secrets.\r\n\r\nDr. Judd, an American naturalist, who, in 1841, descended into the\r\ncrater of Kilauea, on Mauna Loa, in Hawaii, well-nigh fell a victim to\r\nhis curiosity. At that time, the smallest of the two lava pools which\r\nboil at the bottom of that extraordinary pit appeared almost inactive,\r\ngiving out only vapours, with an occasional jet of lava at its centre.\r\nDr. Judd, considering the quiet favourable for dipping up some of the\r\nliquid with an iron ladle, descended for the purpose to a narrow ledge\r\nbordering the pool. While he was preparing to carry out his plans, his\r\nattention was excited by a sudden sinking of its surface; the next\r\ninstant it began to rise, and then followed an explosion, throwing the\r\nlava higher than his head. He had scarcely escaped from his dangerous\r\nsituation, the moment after, by the aid of a native, before the lava\r\nboiled up, covered the place where he stood, and, flowing out over the\r\nnorthern side, extended in a stream a mile wide to a distance of more\r\nthan a mile and a half!\r\n\r\nIn extinct volcanoes, the picture of desolation originally shown by\r\ntheir craters has not seldom been changed into one of charming\r\nloveliness. Tall forest trees cover the bottom of the Tofua crater in\r\nUpolu, one of the Samoan group; and in the same island, a circular lake\r\nof crystal purity, belted with a girdle of the richest green, has formed\r\nin the depth of the Lanuto crater.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EXTINCT CRATER OF HALEAKALA.]\r\n\r\nThe lakes of Averno near Naples, and of Bolsena, Bracciano, and\r\nRonciglione, likewise fill the hollows of extinct craters, constituting\r\nscenes of surpassing beauty, rendered still more impressive by the\r\nremembrance of the stormy past which preceded their present epoch of\r\ntranquillity and peace. Mr. Mallet describes, with glowing colours, the\r\nsingular beauty of\r\n\r\nthe forest scenery around the two extinct craters of Mount Vultur in\r\nApulia, which time has converted into two deep circular lakes.\r\n\r\n‘I descend amongst aged trunks and overarching limbs, and pass over\r\nmasses of rounded lava-blocks and cemented lapilli. All is quietude; the\r\nsoft breeze of a quiet winter’s afternoon fans across the embosomed\r\nwater, from the early wheat-fields and the furrowed acres of the\r\nopposite steep slopes, and brings the gentle ripple lapping amongst the\r\nroots of the old hazels at my feet.\r\n\r\n‘Off before me, and to my left, crowning the slope, are the grey ruins\r\nof some ancient church or castle, and far above me to the right, nestled\r\nagainst the lava crags, behind and above it, standing out white and\r\nclear, I see the strong buttressed mass of the monastery of St. Michael.\r\nHow hard it is to realise that this noble and lovely scene, full of\r\nevery leafy beauty, was once the innermost bowl of a volcano; that every\r\nstone around me, now glorious in colour with moss and lichen, sedum and\r\ngeranium, was once a glowing mass, vomited from out that fiery and\r\nundiscovered abyss, which these placid waters now bury in their secret\r\nchambers.’\r\n\r\nThe line of demarcation between active and extinct volcanoes is not\r\neasily drawn, as eruptions have sometimes taken place after such long\r\nintervals of repose as to warrant the belief that the vents from which\r\nthey issued had long since been completely obliterated. Thus, though\r\nnearly six centuries have passed since the last eruption of Epomeo in\r\nthe island of Ischia, we are not entitled to suppose it extinct, since\r\nnearly seventeen centuries elapsed between this last explosion and the\r\none which preceded it. Since the beginning of the fourteenth century\r\nVesuvius also enjoyed a long rest of nearly three hundred years. During\r\nthis time the crater got covered with grass and shrubs, oak and chestnut\r\ntrees grew around it, and some warm pools of water alone reminded the\r\nvisitor of the former condition of the mountain, when, suddenly, in\r\nDecember 1631, it resumed its ancient activity, and seven streams of\r\nlava at once burst forth from its subterranean furnaces.\r\n\r\nWhile, in many volcanic districts, such as that of the Eifel on the left\r\nbank of the Rhine, and of Auvergne, in Central France, the once active\r\nsubterranean fires have long since been extinguished, and no eruption of\r\nlava has been recorded during the whole period of the historic ages, new\r\nvolcanoes, situated at a considerable distance from all previously\r\nactive vents, have arisen from the bowels of the earth, almost within\r\nthe memory of living man. From the era of the discovery of the New World\r\nto the middle of the last century, the country between the mountains\r\nToluca and Colima, in Mexico, had remained undisturbed, and the space,\r\nnow the site of Jorullo, which is one hundred miles distant from each of\r\nthe above-mentioned volcanoes, was occupied by fertile fields of\r\nsugarcane and indigo, and watered by two brooks. In the month of June\r\n1759, hollow sounds of an alarming nature were heard, and earthquakes\r\nsucceeded each other for two months, until, at the end of September,\r\nflames issued from the ground, and fragments of burning rocks were\r\nthrown to prodigious heights. Six volcanic cones, composed of scoriæ and\r\nfragmentary lava, were formed on the line of a chasm, which ran in the\r\ndirection of N.E. to S.W. The least of the cones was 300 feet in height,\r\nand Jorullo, the central volcano, was elevated 1,600 feet above the\r\nlevel of the plain. The ground where now, in Central America, Isalco\r\ntowers in proud eminence, was formerly the seat of an estancia or\r\ncattle-estate. Towards the end of the year 1769, the inhabitants were\r\nfrequently disturbed by subterranean rumblings and shocks, which\r\nconstantly increased in violence, until on February 23, 1770, the earth\r\nopened, and pouring out quantities of lava, ashes, and cinders gave\r\nbirth to a new volcanic mountain.\r\n\r\nBesides those volcanic vents which are situated on the dry land, there\r\nare others which, hidden beneath the surface of the sea, reveal their\r\nexistence by subaqueous eruptions. Columns of fire and smoke are seen to\r\nrise from the discoloured and agitated waters, and sometimes new islands\r\nare gradually piled up by the masses of scoriæ and ashes ejected from\r\nthe mouth of the submarine volcano. In this manner the island of Sabrina\r\nrose from the bottom of the sea, near St. Michael’s in the Azores, in\r\nthe year 1811; and still more recently, in 1831, Graham’s Island was\r\nformed in the Mediterranean, between the coast of Sicily and that\r\nprojecting part of the African coast where ancient Carthage stood.\r\nSlight earthquake shocks preceded its appearance, then a column of water\r\nlike a water-spout, 60 feet high and 800 yards in circumference, rose\r\nfrom the sea, and soon afterwards dense volumes of steam, which ascended\r\nto the height of 1,800 feet. Then a small island, a few feet high with a\r\ncrater in its centre, ejecting volcanic matter, and immense columns of\r\nvapour, emerged from the agitated waters, and in a fortnight swelled to\r\nthe ample proportions of a height of 200 feet, and a circumference of\r\nthree miles. But both Sabrina and Graham’s Island, being built of loose\r\nscoriæ, were soon corroded by the waves, and their last traces have long\r\nsince disappeared under the surface of the ocean.\r\n\r\nNear Pondicherry, in India; near Iceland, in the Atlantic Ocean; half a\r\ndegree to the south of the equator in the prolongation of a line drawn\r\nfrom St. Helena to Ascension; near Juan Fernandez, &c., similar\r\nphenomena have occurred within the last hundred years, but, probably,\r\nnowhere on a grander scale than in the Aleutian Archipelago, where,\r\nabout thirty miles to the north of Unalaska, near the isle of Umnack, a\r\nnew island, now several thousand feet high and two or three miles in\r\ncircumference, was formed in 1796. The whole bottom of the sea between\r\nthis new creation of the volcanic powers and Umnack has been raised by\r\nthe eruptive throes which gave it birth; and where Cook freely sailed in\r\n1778, numberless cliffs and reefs now obstruct the passage of the\r\nmariner.\r\n\r\nThe famous subaqueous volcano which, in the year 186 before the\r\nChristian era, began its series of historically recorded eruptions, by\r\nraising the islet of Hiera (the ‘Sacred’) in the centre of the Bay of\r\nSantorin, opened two new vents in 1866. Amid a tremendous roar of steam\r\nand the shooting up of prodigious masses of rock and ashes, two islets\r\nwere formed, which ultimately rose to the height of 60 and 200 feet. The\r\neruption continued for many months, to the delight and wonder of the\r\nnumerous geologists who came from all sides to witness the extraordinary\r\nspectacle. Thus, in many parts of the ocean, we see the submarine\r\nvolcanic fires laying the foundations of new islands and archipelagos,\r\nwhich, after repeated eruptions following each other in the course of\r\nages, will probably, like Iceland, extend over a considerable space and\r\nbecome the seats of civilised man.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Map of the World\r\n  _Showing the Distribution of_\r\n  VOLCANOES\r\n  & the Districts visited by\r\n  EARTHQUAKES\r\n]\r\n\r\nAs a very considerable part of the globe has never yet been\r\nscientifically explored, it is, of course, impossible to determine the\r\nexact number of the extinct and active volcanoes which are scattered\r\nover its surface. Werner gives a list of 193 volcanoes, and Humboldt\r\nmentions 407, of which 225 are still in a state of activity. The newest\r\ncomputation of Dr. Fuchs, of Heidelberg,[7] increases the number to a\r\ntotal of 672, of which 270 are active. Future geographical discoveries\r\nwill, no doubt, make further additions to the list, and show that at\r\nleast through a thousand different vents the subterranean fires have, at\r\nvarious periods of the earth’s history, piled up their cones of scoriæ\r\nand lava.\r\n\r\nFootnote 7:\r\n\r\n  ‘Die vulcanischen Erscheinungen der Erde.’ Liepzig, 1865.\r\n\r\nThe volcanoes are very unequally distributed over the surface of the\r\nglobe, for, while in some parts they are thickly clustered together in\r\ngroups or rows, we find in other parts vast areas of land without the\r\nleast sign of volcanic action.\r\n\r\nAn almost uninterrupted range of volcanoes extends in a sinuous line\r\nfrom the Gulf of Bengal, through the East Indian Archipelago, the\r\nMoluccas, the Philippines, Formosa, Japan, and the Kuriles, to\r\nKamtschatka. This desolate peninsula is particularly remarkable for the\r\nenergy of its subterranean fires, as Ermann mentions no less than\r\ntwenty-one active volcanoes, ranged in two parallel lines throughout its\r\nwhole length, and separated from each other by a central range of\r\nmountains, containing a large and unknown number of extinct craters.\r\n\r\nIn Java, where more than thirty volcanoes are more or less active, the\r\nfurnaces of the subterranean world are still more concentrated and\r\ndreadful.\r\n\r\nThe immense mountain-chains which run parallel to the western coasts of\r\nAmerica are likewise crowned with numerous volcanic peaks. Chili alone\r\nhas fourteen active volcanoes, Bolivia and Peru three, Quito eleven. In\r\nCentral America we find twenty-one volcanoes, which are chiefly grouped\r\nnear the Lake of Nicaragua, and to the west of the town of Guatemala.\r\n\r\nThe peninsula of Aljaska, and the chain of the Aleütes, possess no less\r\nthan thirty-six volcanos, scattered over a line about 700 miles long;\r\nand thus we find the eastern, western, and northern boundaries of the\r\nPacific encircled with a girdle of volcanic vents, while the\r\nsubterranean fires have left the western shores of the Atlantic\r\ncomparatively undisturbed.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of Iceland, which is famous for the widely\r\ndevastating eruptions of its burning mountains, the volcanic energies of\r\nEurope are at present limited to the submarine crater of Santorin, and\r\nto the small area of Etna, Vesuvius, and the Lipari Islands. But,\r\nsituated in the centre of the ancient seats of civilisation, and for so\r\nmany centuries the object of the naturalist’s researches, of the\r\ntraveller’s curiosity, and of the poet’s song, they surpass in renown\r\nall other volcanic regions in the world. Most other volcanoes vent their\r\nfury over lands either so wild or so remote that the history of their\r\neruptions almost sounds like a legend from another planet; but thousands\r\nof us have visited Etna and Vesuvius, and the explosion of their rage\r\nmenaces towns and countries which classical remembrances have almost\r\ninvested with the interest of home.\r\n\r\nSome volcanoes are in a continual state of eruption. Isalco, born, as we\r\nhave seen, in 1770, has remained ever since so active as to deserve the\r\nname of the Faro (lighthouse) of San Salvador. Its explosions occur\r\nregularly, at intervals of from ten to twenty minutes, and throw up a\r\ndense smoke and clouds of ashes and stones. These, as they fall, add to\r\nthe height and bulk of the cone, which is now about 2,500 feet high. For\r\nmore than two thousand years, the fires of Stromboli have never been\r\nextinct, nor has it ever failed to be a beacon to the mariner while\r\nsailing after nightfall through the Tyrrhenian Sea. Mr. Poulett Scrope,\r\nwho visited Stromboli in 1820, and looked down from the edge of the\r\ncrater into the mouth of the volcano, some 300 feet beneath him, found\r\nthe phenomena precisely such as Spallanzani described them in 1788. ‘Two\r\nrude openings show themselves among the black chaotic rocks of scoriform\r\nlava which form the floor of the crater. One, is to appearance, empty,\r\nbut from it there proceeds, at intervals of a few minutes, a rush of\r\nvapour, with a roaring sound, like that of a smelting furnace when the\r\ndoor is opened, but infinitely louder. It lasts about a minute. Within\r\nthe other aperture, which is perhaps twenty feet in diameter, and but a\r\nfew yards distant, may be distinctly perceived a body of molten matter,\r\nhaving a vivid glow even by day, approaching to that of white heat,\r\nwhich rises and falls at intervals of from ten to fifteen minutes. Each\r\ntime that it reaches in its rise the lip of the orifice, it opens at the\r\ncentre, like a great bubble bursting, and discharges upwards an\r\nexplosive volume of dense vapour, with a shower of fragments of\r\nincandescent lava and ragged scoriæ, which rise to a height of several\r\nhundred feet above the lip of the crater.’\r\n\r\nThe volcanoes of Masaya, near the lake of the same name in Nicaragua; of\r\nSioa, in the Moluccas; and of Tofua, in the Friendly Islands, are also,\r\nlike Stromboli, in a state of permanent eruption. But far more commonly\r\nthe volcanoes burst forth only from time to time in violent paroxysms,\r\nseparated from each other by longer phases of moderate activity, during\r\nwhich their phenomena are confined to the exhalation of vapours and\r\ngases, sometimes also to the ejection of scoriæ or ashes; to the\r\noscillations of lava rising or subsiding in the shaft of the crater, to\r\nthe gentle outflow of small streams of lava from its eruptive cone, and\r\nto slight commotions of its border. A continual or periodical exhalation\r\nof steam and gases from the shaft of the crater or from chasms and\r\nfissures in its bottom, is the commonest phenomenon shown by an active\r\nvolcano while in a state of tranquillity. Aqueous vapours compose the\r\nchief part of these exhalations, and along with other volatile\r\nsubstances, such as sulphuretted hydrogen, sulphurous acid, muriatic\r\nacid, and carbonic acid, form the steam-jets or _fumaroles_, which\r\nescape with a hissing or roaring noise from all the crevices and chasms\r\nof the crater, and, uniting as they ascend in a single vapour-cloud,\r\nultimately compose the lofty column of steam which forms so conspicuous\r\na feature in the picturesque beauty of Etna or Vesuvius. High on the\r\nsummit of Mauna Loa, where all vegetation has long since ceased, the\r\nwarm steam of the fumaroles gives rise to a splendid growth of ferns in\r\ncrevices sheltered from the wind; and on the island of Pantellaria, the\r\nshepherds, by laying brushwood before the fumaroles, condense the steam,\r\nand thus procure a supply of water for their goats.\r\n\r\nThe gentle fluctuations of lava in a crater while in a state of moderate\r\nactivity are nowhere exhibited on a grander scale than in the pit of\r\nKilauea on Mauna Loa. The mountain rises so gradually as almost to\r\nresemble a plain, and the crater appears like a vast gulf excavated in\r\nits flanks. The traveller perceives his approach to it by a few small\r\nclouds of steam, rising from fissures not far from his path. While\r\ngazing for a second indication, he stands unexpectedly upon the brink of\r\nthe pit. A vast amphitheatre seven miles and a half in circuit has\r\nopened to view. Beneath a gray rocky precipice of 650 feet, a narrow\r\nplain of hardened lava extends, like a vast gallery, around the whole\r\ninterior. Within this gallery, below another similar precipice of 340\r\nfeet, lies the bottom, a wide plain of bare rock more than two miles in\r\nlength. Here all is black monotonous desolation, excepting certain spots\r\nof a blood-red colour, which appear to be in constant yet gentle\r\nagitation.\r\n\r\nWhen Professor Dana visited Kilauea (December 1840), he was surprised at\r\nthe stillness of the scene. The incessant motion in the blood-red pools\r\nwas like that of a cauldron in constant ebullition. The lava in each\r\nboiled with such activity as to cause a rapid play of jets over its\r\nsurface. One pool, the largest of the three then in action, was\r\nafterwards ascertained by survey to measure 1,500 feet in one diameter\r\nand 1,000 in another; and this whole area was boiling, as seemed from\r\nabove, with nearly the mobility of water. Still all went on quietly. Not\r\na whisper was heard from the fires below. White vapours rose in fleecy\r\nwreaths from the pools and numerous fissures, and above the large lake\r\nthey collected into a broad canopy of clouds, not unlike the snowy heaps\r\nor cumuli that lie near the horizon on a clear day, though their\r\nfanciful shapes changed more rapidly.\r\n\r\nOn descending afterwards to the black ledge or gallery at the verge of\r\nthe lower pit, a half-smothered gurgling sound was all that could be\r\nheard from the pools of lava. Occasionally, there was a report like that\r\nof musketry, which died away, and left the same murmuring sound, the\r\nstifled mutterings of a boiling fluid.\r\n\r\nSuch was the scene by day—awful, melancholy, dismal—but at night it\r\nassumed a character of indescribable sublimity. The large cauldron, in\r\nplace of its bloody glare, now glowed with intense brilliancy, and the\r\nsurface sparkled with shifting points of dazzling light, occasioned by\r\nthe jets in constant play. The broad canopy of clouds above the pit,\r\nwhich seemed to rest on a column of wreaths and curling heaps of lighted\r\nvapour, and the amphitheatre of rocks around the lower depths, were\r\nbrightly illuminated from the boiling lavas, while a lurid red tinged\r\nthe distant parts of the inclosing walls and threw their cavernous\r\nrecesses into deeper shades of darkness. Over this scene of restless\r\nfires and fiery vapours, the heavens by contrast seemed unnaturally\r\nblack, with only here and there a star, like a dim point of light.\r\n\r\nA paroxysmal eruption is generally announced by the intensification of\r\nthe phenomena above described. Slight earthquakes are felt in the\r\nneighbourhood of the volcano, and follow each other in more rapid\r\nsuccession and with greater violence as the catastrophe draws near. A\r\ndeep noise like the rolling of thunder, or like the roar of distant\r\nartillery, is heard under the ground; the white steam from the crater\r\nascends in denser clouds, which soon acquire a darker tinge; and now the\r\nbottom of the crater suddenly bursts with a terrific crash, and with the\r\nrapidity of lightning, an immense column of black smoke shoots up into\r\nthe air, and, expanding at its upper end into a broad horizontal canopy,\r\nassumes a shape which has been compared with that of the Italian pine,\r\nthe graceful tree of the South. As the column of smoke spreads over the\r\nsky, it obscures the light of the sun and changes day into night. Along\r\nwith the smoke, showers of glowing lava are cast high up into the air,\r\nand, rising like rockets, either fall back into the crater or rattle\r\ndown the declivity of the cone.\r\n\r\nAt night the scene assumes a character of matchless grandeur, when the\r\ncolumn of smoke—or, more properly speaking, of scoriæ, vapour, and\r\nimpalpable dust—is illuminated by the vivid light of the lava glowing in\r\nthe crater beneath. It then appears as an immense pillar of fire, rising\r\nwith steady majesty in the midst of the uproar of all the elements, and\r\never and anon traversed by flashes of still greater brilliancy from the\r\nmasses of liquid lava hurled forth by the volcano.\r\n\r\nThe detonations which accompany an eruption are sometimes heard as\r\nsingle crashes, at others as a rolling thunder or as a continuous\r\nroaring. They are frequently audible at an astonishing distance, over\r\nareas of many thousand square miles, and with such violence that they\r\nmay be supposed to proceed from the immediate neighbourhood. Thus,\r\nduring the eruption of Cosiguina in Nicaragua, which took place in the\r\nyear 1834, the detonations were heard as loud as a thunderstorm in the\r\nneighbourhood of Kingston in Jamaica, and even at Santa Fé de Bogota,\r\nwhich is a thousand miles distant from the volcano. With the increase of\r\nsteam generated during an eruption, the quantity of ejected scoriæ\r\nlikewise increases in an astonishing manner, so that the volcano’s mouth\r\nresembles a constantly discharging mine of the most gigantic dimensions.\r\n\r\nThe stones and ashes projected during a volcanic eruption vary\r\nconsiderably in size, from blocks twelve or fifteen feet in diameter to\r\nthe finest dust. Both their immense quantity, and the force with which\r\nthey are hurled into the air, show the utter insignificance of the\r\nstrength displayed by the most formidable engines invented by man when\r\ncompared with elementary power. Huge blocks are shot forth, as from the\r\ncannon’s mouth, to a perpendicular elevation of 6,000 feet, and La\r\nCondamine relates that in 1533 Cotopaxi hurled stones of eight feet in\r\ndiameter in an oblique direction to the distance of seven miles. The\r\nlighter scoriæ, carried far away by the winds, not seldom bury whole\r\nprovinces under a deluge of sand and ashes; and their disastrous\r\neffects, spreading over an immense area, are frequently greater than\r\nthose of the lava-streams, whose destructive power is necessarily\r\nconfined to a narrower space. To cite but a few examples, the rain of\r\nsand and ashes which in 1812 menaced the Island of St. Vincent with the\r\nfate of Pompeii soon buried every trace of vegetation, and the\r\naffrighted planters and negroes fled to the town. But here also the\r\nblack sand, along with many larger stones, fell rattling like hail upon\r\nthe roofs of the houses, while at the same time a tremendous\r\nsubterranean thunder increased the horrors of the scene. Even Barbadoes,\r\nthough eighty miles from St. Vincent’s, was covered with ashes. A black\r\ncloud, approaching from the sea, brought with it such pitchy darkness\r\nthat in the rooms it was impossible to distinguish the windows, and a\r\nwhite pocket-handkerchief could not be seen at a distance of five\r\ninches.\r\n\r\nThe fall of ashes caused in April 1815 by the eruption of the Temboro,\r\nin Sumbawa, not only devastated the greater part of the island, but\r\nextended in a westerly direction to Java, and to the north, as far as\r\nCelebes, with such an intensity that it became perfectly dark at noon.\r\nThe roofs of houses at the distance of forty miles were broken in by the\r\nweight of the ashes that fell upon them. To the west of Sumatra the\r\nsurface of the sea was covered two feet deep with a layer of floating\r\npumice or scoriæ, through which ships with difficulty forced their way.\r\n\r\nBy the terrific eruption of Cosiguina in the Gulf of Fonseca, in Central\r\nAmerica, in 1835, all the ground within a radius of twenty-five miles\r\nwas loaded with scoriæ and ashes to the depth of ten feet and upwards,\r\nwhile the lightest and finest ash was carried by the winds to places\r\nmore than 700 miles distant. Eight leagues to the southward of the\r\ncrater the ashes covered the ground to the depth of three yards and a\r\nhalf, destroying the woods and dwellings. Thousands of cattle perished,\r\ntheir bodies being in many instances one mass of scorched flesh. Deer\r\nand other wild animals sought the towns for protection; birds and beasts\r\nwere found suffocated in the ashes, and the neighbouring streams were\r\nstrewed with dead fish.\r\n\r\nWhen we consider the amazing quantity of stones and ashes ejected in\r\nthese and similar instances by volcanic power, we cannot wonder that\r\nconsiderable mountains have frequently been piled up by one single\r\neruption. Thus in the Bay of Baiæ near Naples, Monte Nuovo, a hill 440\r\nfeet high, and with a base of more than a mile and a half in\r\ncircumference, formed, in less than twelve hours, on September 29, 1538;\r\nand a few days gave birth to Monte Minardo, near Bronte, on the slopes\r\nof Etna, which rises to the still more considerable height of 700 feet.\r\nIt would be curious to calculate how many thousands of workmen, and what\r\nlength of time, man would need to raise mounds like these, produced by\r\nan almost instantaneous effort of nature.\r\n\r\nIn other cases the expansive power of the elastic vapours, which cast up\r\nthese prodigious masses from the bowels of the earth, is such as to blow\r\nto pieces the volcanic cone through which it seeks its vent.\r\n\r\nIn Quito there is an ancient tradition that Capac Urcu, which means ‘the\r\nchief,’ was once the highest volcano near the equator, being higher than\r\nChimborazo, but at the beginning of the fifteenth century a prodigious\r\neruption took place which broke it down. The fragments of trachyte, says\r\nMr. Boussingault, which once formed the conical summit of this\r\ncelebrated mountain, are at this day spread over the plain. On August\r\n11, 1772, the Pepandajan, in Java, formerly one of the highest mountains\r\nof the island, broke out in eruption; the inhabitants of the country\r\naround prepared for flight, but, before they could escape, the greater\r\npart of its summit was shivered to pieces and covered the neighbourhood\r\nwith its ruins, so that in the upper part of the Gurat valley forty\r\nvillages were completely buried. During the dreadful eruption of 1815,\r\nthe Temboro, in Sumbawa, is said to have lost at least one-third of its\r\nheight from the explosion of its summit, and similar instances are\r\nmentioned as having occurred among the volcanoes of Japan.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1638 a colossal cone called the Peak, in the Isle of Timor,\r\none of the Moluccas, was entirely destroyed by a paroxysmal explosion.\r\nThe whole mountain, which was before this continually active, and so\r\nhigh that its light was visible, it is said, three hundred miles off,\r\nwas blown up and replaced by a concavity now containing a lake.\r\n\r\nAgain, according to M. Moreau de Jonnes, in 1718, on March 6–7, at St.\r\nVincent’s, one of the Leeward Isles, the shock of a terrific earthquake\r\nwas felt, and clouds of ashes were driven into the air, with violent\r\ndetonations, from a mountain situated at the eastern end of the island.\r\nWhen the eruption had ceased, it was found that the whole mountain had\r\ndisappeared like the baseless fabric of a dream.\r\n\r\nThe disastrous effects of the showers of sand, pumice, and lapilli\r\nejected by a volcanic eruption are increased by the transporting power\r\nof water. The aqueous vapours which are evolved so copiously from\r\nvolcanic craters during eruptions, and often for a long time\r\nsubsequently to the discharge of scoriæ and lava, are condensed as they\r\nascend in the cold atmosphere surrounding the high volcanic peak; and\r\nthe clouds thus formed, being in a state of high electrical tension,\r\ngive rise to terrific thunderstorms. The lightning flashes in all\r\ndirections from the black canopy overhanging the mountain, the\r\nperpetually rolling thunder adds its loud voice to the dreadful roar of\r\nthe labouring volcano, while torrents of rain, sweeping along the light\r\ndust and scoriæ which they carry down with them from the air, or meet\r\nwith on their way, produce currents of mud, often more dreaded than\r\nstreams of lava, from the far greater velocity with which they move.\r\n\r\nIt not seldom happens that the eruptions of volcanoes rising above the\r\nlimits of perpetual snow are preceded or accompanied by the rapid\r\ndissolution of the ice which clothes their summits or their sides, owing\r\nto the high temperature imparted to the whole mass of the mountain by\r\nthe vast conflict raging within. Thus in January 1803 one single night\r\nsufficed to dissolve or sweep away the enormous bed of snow which in\r\ntimes of rest covers the steep cone of Cotopaxi (18,858 feet high), so\r\nthat on the following morning the dark mountain, divested of its\r\nbrilliant robe, gave warning to the affrighted neighbourhood of the\r\nterrific scenes that were about to follow. The volcanoes of Iceland,\r\nwhich mostly rise in the midst of vast fields of perpetual ice,\r\nfrequently exhibit this phenomenon. On October 17, 1758, the eruptive\r\nlabouring of Kötlingia gave birth to three enormous torrents, which\r\ncarried along with them such masses of glacier fragments, sand, and\r\nstones as to cover a space fifty miles long and twenty-five miles broad.\r\nBlocks of ice as large as houses, and partly bearing immense pieces of\r\nstone on their backs, were hurried along by the floods; and soon after\r\nthe eruption took place with a terrific noise.\r\n\r\nA very singular phenomenon sometimes occurs in the gigantic volcanoes of\r\nthe Andes. By the infiltration of water into the crevices of the\r\ntrachytic rock of which they are composed, the caverns situated at their\r\ndeclivities or at their foot are gradually changed into subterranean\r\nlakes or ponds, which frequently communicate by narrow apertures with\r\nthe Alpine brooks of the highlands of Quito. The fish from these brooks\r\nlive and multiply in these subterranean reservoirs thus formed, and when\r\nthe earthquakes which precede every eruption of the Andes chain shake\r\nthe whole mass of the volcano, the caverns suddenly open and discharge\r\nenormous quantities of water, mud, and small fish.\r\n\r\nWhen in the night between the 19th and 20th of June 1698, the summit of\r\nCarguairazo (18,000 feet high) was blown up, so that of the whole\r\ncrater-rim but two enormous peaks remained, the inundated fields were\r\ncovered, over a surface of nearly fifty square miles, with fluid tuff\r\nand clay-mud enveloping thousands of dead fish. Seven years before, the\r\nmalignant fever which prevailed in the mountain-town of Ibarra to the\r\nnorth of Quito was attributed to the effluvia arising from the putrid\r\nfish ejected by the volcano of Imbaburu.\r\n\r\nAmidst all these terrible phenomena—the dreadful noise, the quaking of\r\nthe earth, the ejection of stones and ashes—which, often continuing for\r\nweeks or months, shake the deepest foundations of the volcano, fiery\r\nstreams of liquid lava gush forth sooner or later as from a vase that is\r\nboiling over. Their appearance generally indicates the crisis of the\r\nsubterranean revolution, for the rage of the elements, which until then\r\nhad been constantly increasing, diminishes as soon as the torrent has\r\nfound an outlet. The lava rarely issues from the summit crater of the\r\nmountain; much more frequently it flows from a lateral rent in the\r\nvolcano’s side, which, weakened and dislocated in its texture by\r\nrepeated shocks, at length gives way to the immense pressure of the lava\r\ncolumn boiling within. From the vast size of these eruptive rents, we\r\nmay form some idea of the gigantic power of the forces which give them\r\nbirth.\r\n\r\nThus during the great eruption of Etna in 1669, the south-east flank of\r\nthe mountain was split open by an enormous rent twelve miles long, at\r\nthe bottom of which incandescent lava was seen. The extreme length of\r\nthe fissure which gave lateral issue to the lava of Kilauea in 1840 was\r\ntwenty-five miles, as could distinctly be traced through the disturbance\r\nof the surface rocks above; and in the terrific eruption of Skaptar\r\nJökul, which devastated the west coast of Iceland in 1783, lava gushed\r\nforth from several vents along a fissure of not less than 100 miles in\r\nlength. In some cases the whole mass of the volcano has been cleft in\r\ntwo. Vesuvius was thus rent in October 1822 by an enormous fissure\r\nbroken across its cone in a direction N.W.—S.E.\r\n\r\nHere and there along the line of such a rent, cones of eruption are\r\nthrown up in succession at points where the gaseous matter obtains the\r\nfreest access to the surface, and has power to force up lava and scoriæ.\r\nFew indeed, if any, of the greater volcanic mountains are unattended by\r\nsuch minor elevations, clustering about its sides like the satellites of\r\na planet. Professor Dana found Mauna Loa covered with numerous parasitic\r\ncones, and Mr. Darwin counted several thousands on one of the Gallapagos\r\nIslands. On the flanks of Etna, according to Professor Sartorius von\r\nWaltershausen, more than 700 of them are to be seen, almost all\r\npossessing craters, and each marking the source of a current of lava.\r\nThough they appear but trifling irregularities when viewed from a\r\ndistance as subordinate parts of so imposing and colossal a mountain,\r\nmany of them would nevertheless be deemed hills of considerable height\r\nin almost any other region. The double hill near Nicolosi, called Monte\r\nRossi, formed in 1669, is 450 feet high and two miles in circumference\r\nat its base; and Monte Minardo, near Bronte, on the east of the great\r\nvolcano, is upwards of 700 feet in height.[8]\r\n\r\nFootnote 8:\r\n\r\n  See p. 67.\r\n\r\n‘On looking down from the lower borders of the desert region of Etna,’\r\nsays Sir Charles Lyell, ‘these minor volcanoes, which are most abundant\r\nin the woody region, present us with one of the most delightful and\r\ncharacteristic scenes in Europe. They afford every variety of height and\r\nsize, and are arranged in beautiful and picturesque groups. However\r\nuniform they may appear when seen from the sea, or the plains below,\r\nnothing can be more diversified than their shape when we look from above\r\ninto their craters, one side of which, as we have seen, is generally\r\nbroken down. There are indeed, few objects in nature more picturesque\r\nthan a wooded volcanic crater. The cones situated in the higher parts of\r\nthe forest zone are chiefly clothed with lofty pines, while those at a\r\nlower elevation are adorned with chestnuts, oaks, and beech-trees.’\r\n\r\nAs the point where a lava-current finds a vent is often situated at a\r\nconsiderable distance below the surface of the liquid column in the\r\ninternal chimney of the volcano, the pressure from above not seldom\r\ncauses the lava to spout forth in a jet, until its level in the crater\r\nshaft has been reduced to that of the newly-formed orifice. Thus, when\r\nVesuvius was rent by the dreadful paroxysmal eruption of 1794, the lava\r\nwas seen to shoot up in magnificent fountains as it issued from the\r\nopenings along the fissure.\r\n\r\nFurther on, the lava flows down the mountain’s side according to the\r\nsame laws which regulate the movements of any other stream, whether of\r\nwater, mud, or ice: more rapidly down an abrupt declivity, slower where\r\nthe slope is more gradual; now accumulating in narrow ravines, then\r\nspreading out in plains; sometimes rushing in fiery cascades down\r\nprecipices, and, where insurmountable obstacles oppose its progress, not\r\nseldom breaking off into several branches, each of which pursues its\r\nindependent course.\r\n\r\nAt the point where it issues, the lava flows in perfect solution, but,\r\nas its surface rapidly cools when exposed to the air, it soon gets\r\ncovered with scoriæ, which are dashed over each other in wild confusion,\r\nby successive floods of liquid stone, so as to resemble a stormy sea\r\ncovered with ice-blocks. But the liquefied stone not only hardens on its\r\nexternal surface; it also becomes solid below, where it touches the\r\ncolder soil, so that the fluid lava literally moves along in a crust of\r\nscoriæ, which lengthens in the same proportion as the stream advances.\r\n\r\nThe movements of the lava-current are of course considerably retarded by\r\nthe formation of scoriæ, so that, unless where a greater inclination of\r\nthe soil gives it a new impulse, it flows slower and slower. Thus the\r\nlava-stream which was ejected by Etna during the great eruption of 1669,\r\nperformed the first thirteen Italian miles of its course in twenty days,\r\nor at the average rate of 162 feet per hour, but required no less than\r\ntwenty-three days for the last two miles. While moving on, its surface\r\nwas in general a mass of solid rock; and its mode of advancing, as is\r\nusual with lava streams, was by the occasional fissuring of the solid\r\nwalls. Yet, in spite of the tardiness of its progress, the inhabitants\r\nof Catania watched its advance with dismay, and rushed into the churches\r\nto invoke the aid of the Madonna and the Saints. One citizen only, a\r\ncertain Baron Papalardo, relied more upon his own efforts than upon\r\nsupernatural assistance, and set out with a party of fifty men, dressed\r\nin skins to protect them from the heat, and armed with iron crows and\r\nhooks for the purpose of breaking open one of the solid walls of scoriæ\r\nthat flanked the liquid current, so as to divert it from the menaced\r\ncity. A passage was thus opened for a rivulet of melted matter, which\r\nflowed in the direction of Paterno; but the inhabitants of that town\r\nbeing alarmed for their safety, took up arms against Papalardo, whose\r\nfifty workmen would hardly have been able to cope with the powers of\r\nnature. Thus, slowly but irresistibly, the lava advanced up to the walls\r\nof Catania, which, being formed of huge Cyclopean blocks, and no less\r\nthan sixty feet high, at first stemmed the fiery stream. But the glowing\r\nfloods, pressing against the rampart, rose higher and higher, and\r\nfinally reaching its summit, rushed over it in fiery cataracts, and\r\ndestroying part of the town, at length disgorged themselves into the\r\nsea, where they formed a not inconsiderable promontory.\r\n\r\nA truly gigantic conflict might naturally be expected from the meeting\r\nof two such powerful and hostile bodies as fire and water. This,\r\nhowever, is by no means the case, for as soon as the lava enters the\r\nsea, the rapid evaporation of the water that comes into immediate\r\ncontact with it accelerates the cooling of the surface and thickens the\r\nhard external crust to such a degree that very soon all communication is\r\ncut off between the water and the fiery mass. While the lava continues\r\nto advance from the land, the crust of scoriæ is prolonged in the same\r\nproportion, and should it be rent here and there, steam is at once\r\ndeveloped with such violence as to prevent all further access of the\r\nwater into the interior of the fissures. Thus, Breislak informs us that,\r\nin 1794, the eruption of a lava-stream into the Bay of Naples, near\r\nTorre del Greco, took place with the greatest tranquillity, so that he\r\nhimself was able to observe the advancing of the lava into the sea while\r\nseated in a boat immediately near it, without being disturbed by\r\nexplosions or any other violent phenomenon.\r\n\r\nAs the crust of scoriæ is so bad a conductor of heat, it occasions a\r\nvery slow cooling and hardening in the interior of the lava-stream,\r\nforming as it were a vessel in which the liquid fire can be retained and\r\npreserved for a long time. When Elie de Beaumont visited the lava-stream\r\nof Etna, nearly two years after its eruption in 1832, its interior was\r\nstill so warm that he could not hold his finger in the hot steam issuing\r\nfrom its crevices. It has also been proved, on trustworthy evidence,\r\nthat after twenty-five and thirty years, many lava-streams of Etna still\r\ncontinued to emit heat and steam; and after twenty-one years it was\r\npossible to light a cigar in the crevices of the lava that issued from\r\nJorullo in 1759.\r\n\r\nAnother extremely curious effect of the scoriæ being such bad conductors\r\nof heat is, that masses of snow will remain unmelted, though a lava-\r\nstream rolls over them. Thus, in 1787, the lava of Etna flowed over a\r\nlarge deposit of snow, which, however, was by no means fully liquefied,\r\nbut remained for the greatest part entire, and gradually changed into a\r\ngranular and solid mass of ice. This was traced in 1828, by the\r\ngeologist Gemellaro, for a distance of several hundred feet under the\r\nlava, and most likely still reposes under it as in an ice-cellar. The\r\ncliffs which form the vast crater-ring of the Isle of Deception, in the\r\nextreme Southern Atlantic, are likewise composed of alternate layers of\r\nice and lava. Probably in both these cases the ice-beds had been covered\r\nbefore the lava flowed over them, by a rain of scoriæ and volcanic sand,\r\nwhich is so well known among the shepherds in the higher regions of Etna\r\nas a bad conductor of caloric, that, to obtain a supply of water for\r\ntheir herds during the summer, they cover some snow a few inches deep\r\nwith volcanic sand, which entirely prevents the penetration of solar\r\nheat.\r\n\r\nMost of the recent lava-streams evolve from all their fissures and rents\r\na quantity of vapour, so as to be dotted with innumerable fumaroles, and\r\nto exhibit, as they flow along, a smoking surface by day and a luminous\r\none by night. At first these fumaroles are so impetuous that they\r\nfrequently puff up the lava-crust around their orifices into little\r\ncones or hillocks, consisting of blocks of scoriæ irregularly piled up\r\nover each other, and from whose summit the vapours continue to ascend.\r\nAs the mass cools, they are naturally lessened in numbers and in power;\r\nbut in 1803 Humboldt still saw fumaroles from twenty to thirty feet\r\nhigh, rising from the small cones which covered by thousands the great\r\nlava-stream of Jorullo of the year 1759.\r\n\r\nThe vast dimensions of single lava-streams give proof of the enormous\r\npowers which forced them out of the bowels of the earth. The lava-stream\r\nof Vesuvius which destroyed Torre del Greco in 1794, is 17,500 French\r\nfeet long, and when it reached the town was more than 2,000 feet wide\r\nand forty feet deep. While this mighty mass of molten stone, the volume\r\nof which has been reckoned at about 457 millions of cubic feet, was\r\ndescending towards the sea, another stream, whose mass is computed at\r\nabout one-half of that of the former, was flowing in the direction of\r\nMauro. This single eruption has therefore furnished more than 685\r\nmillions of cubic feet of lava, equal to a cube of 882 feet, in which at\r\nleast a dozen of the largest churches, palaces, and pyramids on earth\r\nmight conveniently find room. If to the solid lava we add the\r\nastonishing quantities of scoriæ, sand, and ashes thrown out by this\r\nsame eruption, we may form some idea of the masses of matter which were\r\nin this one instance ejected from the interior of the earth.\r\n\r\nThe volume of the lava-stream which flowed from the volcano of the Isle\r\nof Bourbon in the year 1787 is estimated at 2,526 millions of cubic\r\nfeet; but even this astonishing ejection of molten stone is surpassed by\r\nthat which took place during the eruption of Skaptar Jökull[9] in 1783,\r\nwhen the lava rolled on to a length of fifty miles, and, on reaching the\r\nplain, expanded into broad lakes, twelve and fifteen miles in diameter\r\nand a hundred feet deep.\r\n\r\nFootnote 9:\r\n\r\n   A detailed account of this eruption, one of the most dreadful on\r\n  record, is given in ‘The Polar World,’ chap. vi. p. 81.\r\n\r\nIn the great eruption of Mauna Loa, which commenced on the 30th of May\r\n1840, the lava began to flow from a small pit-crater called Avare, about\r\nsix miles from Kilauea. The light was seen at a distance, but, as there\r\nwas no population in that direction, it was supposed to proceed from a\r\njungle on fire. The next day another outbreak was perceived farther\r\ntowards the coast, and general alarm prevailed among the natives, now\r\naware of the impending catastrophe. Other openings followed, and by\r\nMonday the 1st of June the large flow had begun, which formed a\r\ncontinuous stream to the sea, which it reached on the 3rd. This flood\r\nissued from several fissures along its whole course, instead of being an\r\noverflow of lava from a single opening; it started from an elevation of\r\n1,244 feet, as determined by Captain Wilkes, at a point twenty-two miles\r\ndistant from the first outbreak, and twelve from the shore. The scene of\r\nthe flowing lava, as we are told by those who saw it, was indescribably\r\nmagnificent. As it rolled along it swept away forests in its course, at\r\ntimes parting and inclosing islets of earth and shrubbery, and at other\r\ntimes undermining and bearing along masses of rock and vegetation on its\r\nsurface. Finally, it plunged into the sea with loud detonations, and for\r\nthree weeks continued to disgorge itself with little abatement.\r\n\r\nThe light which it emitted converted night into day over all eastern\r\nHawaii. It was distinctly visible for more than one hundred miles at\r\nsea, and at the distance of forty miles fine print could be read at\r\nmidnight. As previous to the eruption, the whole vast pit of Kilauea had\r\nbeen filled to the brim with the lava, which, bursting through the\r\nflanks of the mountain, thus found a vent towards the sea, we have some\r\nmeans of estimating the volume of the ejected masses in the actual cubic\r\ncontents of the emptied pit. The area of the lower pit, as determined by\r\nthe surveys of the American Exploring Expedition, is equal to 38,500,000\r\nsquare feet. Multiplying this by 400 feet, the depth of the pit after\r\nthe eruption, we have 15,400,000,000 cubic feet for the solid contents\r\nof the space occupied by lava before the eruption, and therefore the\r\nactual amount of the material which flowed from Kilauea. This is\r\nequivalent to a triangular range 800 feet high, two miles long, and over\r\na mile wide at base!\r\n\r\nThough generally symptoms of violent disturbance, such as shakings of\r\nthe earth and loud thundering noises, precede the eruption of lava, yet\r\nthis is not always the case. Thus the craters of Mount Kea have\r\nfrequently disgorged their masses of molten stone without such\r\naccompanying phenomena. In 1843, when the volcano poured out a flood of\r\nlava, reaching for twenty-five miles down its side, all took place so\r\nquietly that persons at the foot of the mountain were unaware of it,\r\nexcept from the glare of light after the action had begun. Through its\r\nprogress no sounds were heard below, nor did it cause any perceptible\r\nvibrations, except in the region of the outbreak, and there none of much\r\nviolence.\r\n\r\nThe lava sometimes cools down with a smooth, solid, undulating surface,\r\nmarked with rope-like lines and concentric folds, such as are seen on\r\nany densely viscid liquid if drawn out as it hardens; but much more\r\nfrequently it appears as if shattered to a chaos of ruins. The fragments\r\nvary from one to hundreds of cubic feet, or from a half-bushel measure\r\nto a house of moderate size. They are of all shapes, often in angular\r\nblocks, and sometimes in slabs, and are horribly rough, having deep\r\nrecesses everywhere among them. The traveller shudders as his path leads\r\nhim over a lava-field, thus bristling with myriads of spikes, where the\r\nleast false step would precipitate him into the deep cavities, among the\r\njagged surfaces and edges. This scene of horrid confusion often extends\r\nfor miles in every direction, and, viewed from its central part, the\r\nwhole horizon around is one wide waste of gray and black desolation,\r\nbeyond the power of words to describe.\r\n\r\nThe breaking up of a lava-field into chaotic masses evidently proceeds\r\nfrom a temporary cessation, either complete or partial, and a subsequent\r\nflow of a stream of lava. The surface cools and hardens as soon as the\r\nstream slackens; afterwards there is another heaving of the lava, and an\r\nonward move, owing to a succeeding ejection or the removing of an\r\nobstacle, and the motion breaks up the hardened crust, piling the masses\r\ntogether, either in slabs or huge angular fragments, according to the\r\nthickness to which the crust had cooled. If the motion of a lava-stream\r\nbe quite slow, the cooling of the front of it may cause its cessation,\r\nthus damming it up and holding it back, till the pressure from gradual\r\naccumulation behind sweeps away the barrier. It then flows on again,\r\ncarrying on its surface masses of the hardened crust—some, it may be, to\r\nsink and melt again, but the larger portion to remain as a field of\r\nclinkers. The breaking-up of the ice of some streams in spring gives\r\nsome idea of the manner in which the hardened masses of a lava-field are\r\npiled up as it moves along; but to form a just idea of the greatness of\r\nthe effect, the mind must bring before it a stream, not of the scanty\r\nlimits of most rivers, but one, not unfrequently, of several miles in\r\nbreadth: besides, in place of slabs of pure and clear ice, there should\r\nbe substituted shaggy heaps of black scoriæ, and a depth or thickness of\r\nmany yards in place of a few inches.\r\n\r\nWhere volcanic mud-streams have flooded the land, or a rain of ashes and\r\nlight scoriæ has descended upon the soil, its fertility may soon be\r\nrestored under the influence of a sunny sky; but as far as the lava\r\nreaches, a stony wilderness often remains for ages, particularly in the\r\ncolder regions of the earth. Thus, though many of the lava-fields of\r\nIceland have existed long before the first Scandinavian colonists\r\nsettled in the land, their surface is generally as naked as when they\r\nfirst issued from the volcano; and where signs of vegetation may be seen\r\namong their fragments, the eye finds nothing to relieve the horrid\r\nmonotony of the scene but spare patches of lichen and mosses, or here\r\nand there some dwarf herb or shrub that hardly ventures to peep forth\r\nfrom the crevice in which it has found a shelter. But in a milder\r\nclimate, such as that of Italy, and still more rapidly in the torrid\r\nzone, the horrid nakedness of a lava-field undergoes a more rapid\r\ntransformation, provided a sufficient moisture favours the growth of\r\nplants. The rains promote the decomposition of the lava, and a rank\r\nvegetation succeeds, which in its turn assists the work of\r\ndecomposition, and thus hastens the accumulation of soil. Ferns and\r\ngrasses spring up in the nooks and crevices, and finally the vine or the\r\ntaro flourish luxuriantly, for nothing can exceed the fertility of a\r\ndisintegrated lava-field.\r\n\r\nVolcanoes have frequently been considered as safety-valves, which, by\r\naffording a vent to subterranean vapours, preserve the neighbouring\r\nregions from the far more disastrous and wide-spreading effects of\r\nearthquakes; and facts are not wanting which seem to justify this\r\nopinion. After the soil had trembled for a long time throughout the\r\nwhole of Syria, in the Cyclades, and in Eubœa, the shocks suddenly\r\nceased when, in the plains near Chalcis, a stream of ‘_glowing mud_’\r\n(lava from a crevice) issued from the bowels of the earth. Strabo, who\r\nrelates this incident, adds that ‘since the craters of Etna have been\r\nopened, through which fire ascends, the land on the sea-coast is less\r\nsubject to earthquakes than at the time when all vents on the surface\r\nwere stopped up.’\r\n\r\nBefore the earthquake which destroyed the town of Riobamba, the smoke of\r\nthe volcano of Pasto, which is 200 miles distant, disappeared. The\r\nNeapolitans and Sicilians consider the eruptions of Vesuvius and Etna,\r\nor even a more lively activity of these volcanoes, as a certain\r\npreservative against devastating earthquakes, and we meet with the same\r\nbelief among the inhabitants of Quito and Peru. But in many cases this\r\nfancied security has proved to be delusive, as very violent earthquakes\r\nhave not seldom been found to accompany volcanic eruptions. The great\r\nChilian earthquake of 1835 coincided with an eruption of Antuco; and the\r\nshocks which agitated all Kamtschatka and the long chain of the Kurilian\r\nIslands, in 1737, occurred simultaneously with an eruption of\r\nKlîutschewskaja Skopa.\r\n\r\nProfessor Dana doubts whether action so deep-seated as that of the\r\nearthquake must be can often find relief in the narrow channels of a\r\nvolcano miles in length. He points out the example of Mauna Loa, where\r\nlavas are frequently poured out from the summit crater, at an elevation\r\nof more than 10,000 feet above Kilauea, so that the latter,\r\nnotwithstanding its extent, the size of its great lakes of lava, and the\r\nfreedom of the incessant ebullition, is not a safety-valve that can\r\nprotect even its own immediate neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nIn his opinion volcanoes might more fitly be called indexes of danger.\r\nThey point out those portions of the globe which are most subject to\r\nearthquakes, and are results of the same causes that render a country\r\nliable to such convulsions.\r\n\r\nThe phenomena attending an eruption can leave no doubt that below every\r\nactive volcano a large subterranean cavity must exist in which melted\r\nlava accumulates. The partisans of the theory which supposes the earth\r\nto consist of a central fluid mass with a solid shell resting upon it,\r\nattribute the formation of volcanoes to rents or fissures in this crust\r\nthrough which the lava is cast forth; but the local development of heat\r\nby chemical action, or some other unknown cause, is quite sufficient to\r\naccount for the existence of fiery lakes imbedded in a solid mass, and\r\nwhich, though insignificant when compared with the surface of the globe,\r\nmay still be large enough to produce volcanic phenomena on the grandest\r\nscale.\r\n\r\nThe cause of the reaction of such a reservoir against the surface of the\r\nearth must in all probability be sought for in the expansive force of\r\nsteam; for when water, penetrating through crevices or porous strata,\r\ncomes in contact with the heated subterranean mass, it is evident that\r\nthe steam thus generated must press upon the lava, and, when formed in\r\nsufficient quantity, ultimately forces it up the duct of the volcano. In\r\nother cases, we may suppose a continuous column of lava mixed with\r\nliquid water raised to a red-hot, or white-hot, temperature under the\r\ninfluence of pressure. A disturbance of equilibrium may first bring on\r\nan eruption near the surface, by the expansion and conversion into gas\r\nof the entangled water, so as to lessen pressure. More and more steam\r\nwould then be liberated, bringing up with it jets of liquid rock, and\r\nultimately ejecting a continuous stream of lava. Its force being spent,\r\na period of rest succeeds, until the conditions for a new outburst\r\n(accumulation of steam and melted rock) are obtained, and another cycle\r\nof similar changes is renewed. The important part which water plays in\r\nvolcanic action is moreover sufficiently proved by the enormous quantity\r\nof steam which is poured forth during every eruption, or is constantly\r\nescaping in the fumaroles of a crater. The various gases (carbonic,\r\nmuriatic, sulphurous) which are likewise exhaled by volcanoes may also\r\nhave been rendered liquid by pressure at great depths, and may assist\r\nthe action of water in causing eruptive outbursts. The great number of\r\nactive volcanoes on sea-coasts and in islands likewise points to the\r\nagency of water in volcanic operations; and in the few cases where\r\neruptive cones are situated far inland, their situation on the borders\r\nof a lake, or their cavernous and porous structure, accounts for the\r\nabsorption of a quantity of atmospheric water, sufficient for the\r\nproduction of volcanic phenomena.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ERUPTION OF VESUVIUS, BAY OF NAPLES.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VII.\r\n                DESTRUCTION OF HERCULANEUM AND POMPEII.\r\n\r\nState of Vesuvius before the eruption in the year 79 A.C.—Spartacus—\r\n  Premonitory Earthquakes—Letter of Pliny the Younger to Tacitus,\r\n  relating the death of his Uncle, Pliny the Elder—Benevolence of the\r\n  Emperor Titus—Herculaneum and Pompeii buried under a muddy alluvium—\r\n  Herculaneum first discovered in 1713.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf all the volcanic eruptions recorded in history there is none more\r\ncelebrated than that which, on the 23rd of August, A.D. 79, buried the\r\ntowns of Herculaneum and Pompeii under a deluge of mud and ashes. Many\r\nother eruptions have no doubt been on a grander scale, or may have\r\nspread ruin and desolation over a wider area, but never has a volcano,\r\nawakening from the slumber of a thousand years, devastated a more\r\nsmiling paradise than the fields of happy Campania, or buried more\r\nbeautiful cities.\r\n\r\nBefore that terrible catastrophe, Mount Vesuvius, now constantly\r\nsmoking, even in times of rest, had, ever since the first colonisation\r\nof South Italy by the Greeks, exhibited no signs of volcanic activity.\r\nEven tradition knew of no previous disturbance. No subterranean thunder,\r\nor sulphurous steams, or cast-up ashes, gave token of the fires\r\nslumbering beneath its basis; and the real nature of the apparently so\r\npeaceful mountain could only be conjectured from the similarity of its\r\nstructure to other volcanoes, or from the ancient lava-streams that\r\nfurrowed its abrupt declivities. At that time also its shape was very\r\ndifferent from its present form, for instead of two apices, it\r\nexhibited, from a distance, the regular outlines of a sharply truncated\r\ncone. Plutarch relates that rough rock walls, piled round its summit,\r\nand overgrown with wild vines, inclosed the waste of the crater.\r\n\r\nWhen, in 73 B.C., Spartacus, with seventy of his comrades, broke the\r\nfetters of an insupportable slavery, he found a secure retreat in this\r\nnatural stronghold, which could only be scaled by a single narrow and\r\ndifficult path. By degrees 10,000 fugitive slaves gathered round his\r\nstandard, and Rome began to tremble for her safety. The prætor Clodius\r\nled an army against the rebels, and surrounded the mountain; but\r\nSpartacus caused ropes to be made of the branches of wild vines, by\r\nmeans of which he, with the boldest of his followers, was let down from\r\nthe rocks, where they were supposed to be totally inaccessible, and,\r\nfalling unawares upon the prætor, put his troops to flight and took his\r\ncamp. The declivities of the mountain, thus become historically\r\nrenowned, were covered with the richest fields and vineyards, and at its\r\nfoot, along the beautiful Bay of Naples, lay the flourishing towns of\r\nHerculaneum and Pompeii, the seats of luxury and refinement. Who could,\r\nthen, have imagined that this charming scene was so soon to be disturbed\r\nin so terrible a manner, and that the time was nigh when the ancient\r\nvolcanic channels, from which, in unknown ages, lava-streams and ashes\r\nhad so frequently broken forth, were once more to be re-opened? The\r\nfirst sign which announced the awakening energies of the volcano was an\r\nearthquake, which, in 63 A.D. devastated the fertile regions of\r\nCampania. From that time to the crowning disaster of 79, slight tremors\r\nof the earth frequently occurred, until, finally, the dreadful eruption\r\ntook place which Pliny the Younger so vividly describes in his\r\ncelebrated letter to Tacitus.\r\n\r\n‘My uncle,’ says the Roman, ‘was at Misenum, where he commanded the\r\nfleet. On the 23rd of August, about one o’clock in the afternoon, my\r\nmother informed him that a cloud of an uncommon size and form was seen\r\nto arise. He had sunned himself (according to the custom of the ancient\r\nRomans), and taken his usual cold bath, then dined, and studied. He\r\nasked for his sandals, and ascended an eminence, from which the\r\nwonderful phenomenon could be plainly seen. The spot from whence the\r\ncloud ascended, in a shape like that of an Italian pine-tree, could not\r\nbe ascertained on account of the distance; its arising from Vesuvius\r\nonly subsequently became known.\r\n\r\n‘In some parts it was white, in others black and spotted, from the ashes\r\nand stones which it carried along. To my uncle, being a learned man, the\r\nphenomenon seemed important, and worthy of a closer investigation. He\r\nordered a light ship to be got ready, and left it to my option to\r\naccompany him. I answered that I preferred studying, and by chance he\r\nhimself had given me something to write. He was on the point of leaving\r\nthe house when he received a letter from Resina, the inhabitants of\r\nwhich, alarmed at the impending danger—the place lay at the foot of the\r\nmountain, and escape was only possible by sea—begged him to help them in\r\ntheir great distress. He now changed his plan, and executed as a hero\r\nthe undertaking to which he had been prompted as a natural philosopher.\r\n\r\n‘He ordered the galleys of war to set sail, and embarked to bring help,\r\nnot only to Resina, but to many other places along the coast, which, on\r\naccount of its loveliness, was very densely peopled.\r\n\r\n‘He hastens to the spot from which others are taking flight, and steers\r\nin a direct line towards the seat of danger, so unconcerned as to\r\ndictate his observations upon all the events and changes of the\r\ncatastrophe, as they passed before his eyes.\r\n\r\n‘Already ashes fell upon the ship, hotter and thicker on approaching, as\r\nalso pumice and other stones blackened and burnt by fire. Suddenly a\r\nshallow bottom, and the masses ejected by the eruption, rendered the\r\ncoast inaccessible. He hesitated for a moment whether he should sail\r\nback again, but, soon resolved, said to the steersman who advised him to\r\ndo so, “Fortune favours the bold; steer towards the villa of\r\nPomponianus.” This friend resided at Stabiæ, on the opposite side of the\r\nbay, where the danger, although as yet at some distance, was still\r\nwithin sight, and menacing enough. Pomponianus had therefore caused his\r\neffects to be conveyed on board a ship, intent on flight so soon as the\r\ncontrary wind should have abated. As soon as my uncle, to whom it was\r\nvery favourable, has landed, he embraces, consoles, encourages his\r\nterrified friend, takes a bath to relieve his fears by his own\r\nconfidence, and dines after the bath with perfect composure, or, what is\r\nno less great, with a serene countenance.\r\n\r\n‘Meanwhile high columns of flame burst forth from Vesuvius in various\r\nplaces, their brilliancy being increased by the darkness of the night.\r\nMy uncle, with the intention of relieving apprehension, said that they\r\nproceeded from the villas which, abandoned by their terrified\r\nproprietors and left a prey to the flames, were now burning in solitude.\r\nHe then retired and slept soundly, for his attendants before the door\r\nheard him fetch his breath, which, on account of his corpulence, was\r\ndeep and loud. But now the court, into which the room opened, became\r\nfilled to such a height with ashes and pumice that by a longer delay he\r\nwould not have been able to leave it. They awaken him, he rises, and\r\ngreets Pomponianus and the others who had watched. They consult\r\ntogether, whether to remain in the house or to flee into the open air,\r\nfor the ground trembled from the repeated and violent shocks of the\r\nearth, and seemed to reel backwards and forwards. On the other hand,\r\nthey feared in the open air the falling of the pumice-stones and\r\ncinders. On comparing these two dangers, flight was chosen; and, as a\r\nprotection against the shower of stones, they covered their heads with\r\ncushions. Everywhere else the day was already far advanced, but the\r\nblackest night still reigned at Stabiæ. Provided with torches, they\r\nresolved to seek the shore, in order to ascertain whether they could\r\nventure to embark, but the sea was found to be too wild and boisterous.\r\n\r\n‘My uncle now lay down upon a carpet, and asked for some cold water, of\r\nwhich he repeatedly drank. The flames and their sulphurous odour drove\r\naway his companions, and forced him to rise. Leaning on two slaves, he\r\ntried to move, but immediately sank down again, suffocated as I believe\r\nby the dense smoke, and by the closing of his larynx, which was by\r\nnature weak, narrow, and subject to frequent spasms. On the third\r\nmorning after his death, the body was found without any marks of\r\nviolence, covered with the clothes he had worn, and more like a person\r\nsleeping than a corpse.’\r\n\r\nThus perished, in his fifty-sixth year, one of the greatest naturalists\r\nand noblest characters of ancient Rome, the philosopher to whom we are\r\nindebted for the first general description of the world—a work which, in\r\nspite of its numerous imperfections and errors, is one of the most\r\ninteresting monuments of classical literature.\r\n\r\nWhen the rage of the volcanic powers had subsided, the sun, now no\r\nlonger obscured by clouds of ashes, shone upon a scene of utter\r\ndesolation, where nature, embellished by art, had, but a few days\r\nbefore, appeared in all her loveliness. The mountain itself had changed\r\nits form, and rose with new peaks to the skies; a thick layer of stones\r\nand dust had settled with the curse of sterility on the fields;\r\nthousands of homeless wretches wandered about disconsolate, and three\r\ntowns—Pompeii, Herculaneum, Stabiæ—had disappeared to be brought to\r\nlight again in a wonderful manner after the lapse of many centuries.\r\n\r\nThis great catastrophe gave the Emperor Titus a fine opportunity for\r\ndisplaying the benevolence which entitled him to be called ‘the delight\r\nof mankind.’ He immediately hastened to the scene of destruction,\r\nappointed guardians of consular rank to distribute among the needy\r\nsurvivors the property of those who had perished without heirs; and\r\nencouraged the weak-hearted, assisting them by liberal donations, until\r\na no less terrible misfortune recalled him to Rome, where a fire, which\r\nlaid almost half the town in ashes, was followed by a plague, which, for\r\nsome time, daily swept away thousands.\r\n\r\nIt has often been asked how so many of the relics buried in Herculaneum\r\nand Pompeii could have been so perfectly preserved as to form a Museum\r\nof the Past for the admiration and instruction of future ages. A stream\r\nof lava would undoubtedly have consumed everything on its fiery track,\r\nbut, fortunately for posterity, it was not a flood of molten stone, but\r\na current of mud which overwhelmed the devoted cities. We learn from\r\nhistory that a heavy shower of sand, pumice, and lapilli was ejected by\r\nVesuvius for eight successive days and nights, in the year 79,\r\naccompanied by violent rains, and thus all these volcanic matters were\r\nconverted into mud-streams, which, rushing down the sides of the\r\nmountain, descended upon Herculaneum and Pompeii. This circumstance\r\nsatisfactorily explains how the _interior_ of the buildings, with all\r\nthe underground vaults and cellars, was filled up, and how all the\r\nobjects they contained could be as perfectly moulded as in a plaster\r\ncast by the muddy alluvium, which subsequently hardened into pumice\r\ntuff. Hence this wonderful preservation of paintings, which, shielded\r\nfrom the destructive influence of the atmosphere, still retained their\r\noriginal freshness of colour when again brought to light by a late\r\ngeneration; these rolls of papyrus which it has been found possible to\r\ndecipher; this perfect cast of a woman’s form, with a child in her arms!\r\n\r\nNo lava has flowed over Pompeii since that city was buried, but with\r\nHerculaneum the case is different. Although the substance which fills\r\nthe interior of the buildings in that doomed city must have been\r\nintroduced in a state of mud like that found in similar situations in\r\nPompeii, yet the superincumbent mass differs wholly in composition and\r\nthickness.\r\n\r\nHerculaneum was situated several miles nearer to the volcano, and has,\r\ntherefore, been always more liable to be covered, not only by showers of\r\nashes, but by alluvium and streams of lava. Accordingly, masses of both\r\nhave accumulated on each other above the ancient site of the city, to a\r\ndepth of nowhere less than 70, and in many places of 112 feet; while the\r\ndepth of the bed of ashes under which Pompeii lies buried seldom exceeds\r\n12 or 14 feet above the houses, and it is even said that the higher part\r\nof the amphitheatre always projected above the surface.\r\n\r\nYet, strange to say, Herculaneum, though far more profoundly hidden, was\r\ndiscovered before Pompeii, by the accidental circumstance that a well\r\nsunk in 1713 came right down upon the theatre where the statues of\r\nHercules and Cleopatra were found. Many others were afterwards dug out\r\nand sent to France by the Prince of Elbeuf, who, having married a\r\nNeapolitan princess, became proprietor of the field under which the\r\ntheatre lies buried. Further excavations were, however, forbidden by\r\nGovernment, and only resumed in 1736. But the difficulty of removing the\r\nlarge masses of lava accumulated above the city, and the circumstance of\r\nits partly lying under the modern towns of Portici and Resina have\r\nconfined the exploration of Herculaneum within narrow limits. The large\r\ntheatre alone is open for inspection, and can be seen only by\r\ntorchlight, so that its dark galleries, cut through the tuff, are but\r\nseldom visited by strangers; while no traveller leaves Naples without\r\nhaving wandered through the ruins of Pompeii, for Italy hardly affords a\r\nmore interesting sight than that of these streets and forums, these\r\ntheatres and temples, these houses and villas, which require but the\r\npresence of their ancient inhabitants to complete the picture of a Roman\r\ntown, such as it was eighteen hundred years ago.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER VIII.\r\n                     GAS SPRINGS AND MUD VOLCANOES.\r\n\r\nCarbonic-acid Springs—Grotto del Cane—The Valley of Death in Java—\r\n  Exaggerated Descriptions—Carburetted Hydrogen Springs—The Holy Fires\r\n  of Baku—Description of the Temple—Mud Volcanoes—The Macaluba in\r\n  Sicily—Crimean Mud Volcanoes—Volcanic Origin of Mud Volcanoes.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe numerous gas springs which in many countries are evolved from an\r\nunknown depth, afford us a convincing proof that the remarkable chemical\r\ntransformations of which we find so many traces in the past history of\r\nour planet are still perpetually taking place in many of the mysterious\r\ncrevices and hollows of the earth-rind. In Auvergne, the Vivarrais, the\r\nEifel, and along the whole basaltic range from the Rhine to the\r\nRiesengebirge in Silesia, carbonic acid gas is exhaled in incredible\r\nquantities from the vast laboratories of the subterranean world.\r\n\r\nProfessor Bischoff found that a single gas spring near Burgbrohl daily\r\nproduced 5,650 cubic feet of carbonic acid, a quantity amounting in the\r\ncourse of a year to no less than 262,000 pounds in weight; and,\r\naccording to Bromeis, the great Artesian spring at Nauheim evolves every\r\nminute 71 cubic feet of carbonic acid, equal to a weight of 5,000,000\r\npounds annually. If from these two instances we judge of the produce of\r\nthe many carbonic acid gas springs of Germany, and if we farther extend\r\nour view to the rest of the world, in many parts of which carbonic acid\r\nprobably escapes in still greater quantities, we can form some idea of\r\nthe geological importance of these springs, which also exercise no small\r\ninfluence upon the organic world. For the incalculable masses of\r\ncarbonic acid which are thus constantly pouring from subterranean vents\r\ninto the atmospheric ocean are again absorbed by millions of plants.\r\nThey feed the forests and the fields; and thus these chemical changes,\r\nwhich are incessantly but imperceptibly modifying the earth-rind,\r\nultimately tend to the advantage of man.\r\n\r\nAs a light dipped in carbonic acid gas is immediately extinguished, and\r\nevery animal inhaling it is liable to instant suffocation, these\r\nproperties are sometimes made use of for cruel experiments, for which,\r\namong others, the insignificant Grotto del Cane, in the kingdom of\r\nNaples—a cave or hole in the side of a mountain near the Lake Agnano—has\r\nbecome notorious. Some miserable dogs are thrust into the stratum of\r\nfixed air which covers the bottom of the hole, and are alternately\r\nalmost choked and resuscitated to satisfy the idle curiosity of\r\ntourists. Their violent efforts to escape, when about to be plunged into\r\nthe poisonous vapour, prove the horrible cruelty of the practice.\r\n\r\nThe carbonic-acid springs in the glen of the Brohl, a small rivulet\r\nflowing into the Rhine, near Andernach, are turned to a better purpose,\r\nfor the manufacture of white lead.\r\n\r\nThe famous ‘Valley of Death,’ or Poison Valley, in the Island of Java,\r\nis nothing more than a funnel-shaped hollow, measuring about 100 feet in\r\ndiameter at the top, and with a bare space in its centre fifteen feet\r\nbroad and long, which is frequently covered with a stratum of carbonic\r\nacid gas. The sides of the hollow, and even the bottom, with the\r\nexception of the above-mentioned naked spot, are everywhere clothed with\r\nshrubbery, or even with forest trees.\r\n\r\nThe dead bodies of stags, tigers, wild boars, and birds are said to have\r\nbeen frequently found in the hollow; but Dr. Junghuhn, the author of a\r\nclassical work on Java, saw in 1838 but one human corpse lying on its\r\nback in the centre of the bare spot. It was still there in 1840, and but\r\nslightly decomposed. In 1845 it had been removed, most likely by some\r\ncompassionate wanderers desirous of giving it a decent burial, for not\r\nthe slightest trace of the skeleton remained. During the years 1838,\r\n1840, and 1845 Junghuhn visited the Valley of Death no less than\r\nthirteen times. When he last saw it, the bodies of six wild hogs were\r\nlying at the bottom, all more or less in a state of putrefaction. The\r\ncrows that were feasting upon their remains proved that a descent might\r\nbe effected without danger, for, on seeing them hopping about on the\r\nnaked soil, even the Javanese entered the circle without hesitation. Not\r\na single trace of carbonic acid was to be perceived, not even when the\r\nbold naturalist stretched himself out upon the ground and drew his\r\nbreath in the crevices and rents with which it is furrowed. Probably the\r\ngas never rises more than three feet above the level of the soil, as at\r\nthis height a luxuriant vegetation begins.\r\n\r\nThis simple description of an accurate observer forms a strange contrast\r\nto the gross exaggeration of other travellers, whose accounts, copied in\r\nmany hand-books, have puffed up a phenomenon hardly superior to that of\r\nthe Grotto del Cane into something like an eighth wonder of the world.\r\nLoudon, who in July 1830 visited the Pakamaran (as the natives call the\r\npit), swells its dimensions to a vast crater about half a mile in\r\ncircumference, thickly strewn with skeletons of men, tigers, game, and\r\nbirds of all kinds; and another recent traveller goes so far as to give\r\nit an extent of twenty miles.\r\n\r\nNext to carbonic acid, but of far less general occurrence, carburetted\r\nhydrogen, which gives rise to the wonderful phenomenon of fiery springs,\r\nis the gas most frequently evolved by volcanic spiracles.\r\n\r\nNear Pietra Mala, between Bologna and Florence, on a spot about twelve\r\nfeet in diameter, several flames rise from the earth, the largest of\r\nwhich ascends to a height of five feet, and is seen burning at night\r\nwith a pale yellow flame, while its minor satellites around are blue\r\ntipped with white. No doubt many a terrible legend is attached to this\r\ninfernal spectacle. Near Barigazzo, between Modena and Pistoja, near the\r\nruins of Velleji, and in many other parts of the volcanic region of the\r\nApennines, similar flames gush out of the ground. The neat little town\r\nof Fredonia, in the State of New York, on the eastern shore of Lake\r\nErie, is lighted by natural springs of carburetted hydrogen, which,\r\nbeing led into a gasometer, feed the seventy or eighty lamps of the\r\ntown. The thrifty and practical Chinese, who have preceded us in so many\r\nuseful discoveries, have for centuries made a like use of the many\r\ngaseous emanations in the provinces of Yunnan, Szutschuan, Kuangsi, and\r\nSchansi, by leading the inflammable air in pipes, wherever they want it\r\nfor lighting or cooking.\r\n\r\nBut there is no place in the world more remarkable for its burning\r\nsprings than Baku, on the western coast of the Caspian Sea, where the\r\nholy and eternal fires are worshipped by the pious Parsees as the\r\nspecial symbol of the Almighty.\r\n\r\nLike most of the cloisters and convents of the Orient, which are exposed\r\nto the incursions of plundering hordes, Aleschga, the temple dedicated\r\nto the worship of fire, is a fortified square inclosing a large\r\ncourtyard, and capable of being defended from the terraced roof. The\r\nouter wall forms at the same time the back of the cells, which front the\r\nyard. Over the entrance gate, which is situated to the north, rises a\r\nhigh bastion or tower, serving as an additional defence, from the\r\nsummit, of which the visitor enjoys after sunset the fantastic view of\r\nthe flames which, untarnished by smoke, rise on all sides from rents and\r\ncrevices in the neighbouring steppe, and wave their bright summits to\r\nand fro like tongues of fire. In the centre of the court stands a square\r\ntower supported by four columns, and inclosing a basin-like excavation,\r\nthree or four feet in diameter, into which the gas is conducted by a\r\npipe from sources beyond the walls of the temple. Four chimneys at the\r\nfour corners of the tower are fed in a similar manner. From the centre\r\nof the tower rises a trident, called _Thirsul_. The Parsees relate that\r\nthe Devil once got possession of the earth, and reigned with despotic\r\nfury. But man in his distress prayed to the Almighty, and an angel came\r\ndown and planted this identical trident in the earth as a token that the\r\ndominion of his Satanic Majesty had ceased. Round the court are twenty-\r\ntwo cells, like those of a Catholic convent. They are very small, and,\r\nwith the exception of a ragged rug, wholly without furniture; but each\r\nof them is provided with a gas pipe, which can be opened or closed at\r\npleasure, and furnishes light and warmth to the inmate. Near the temple\r\na well has been dug fifty feet deep, in which the gas accumulates in\r\nlarger quantities. Koch (‘Wanderungen im Oriente,’ 1843–4) tells us that\r\nhe here enjoyed a sight more wonderful and surprising than any he had\r\never witnessed before. A carpet was spread over the mouth of the well to\r\nprevent the gas from escaping. After a few minutes, a priest seized a\r\nbundle of brushwood, in which a piece of burning paper had been stuck,\r\nand flung it into the well, after quickly removing the carpet. The\r\nstrangers had previously been warned to keep at some distance, and the\r\npriest and his assistants likewise ran off as fast as they could. About\r\nhalf a minute after the fire-brand had been cast into the pit, a\r\nterrific explosion took place, and a vast column of fire, in the shape\r\nof an inverted cone (from the gas spreading out as soon as it emerges\r\nfrom the pit), ascended to the skies.\r\n\r\nHow long the fires of Baku may have been burning is unknown, but it is\r\nvery probable that they did not exist before the Christian era. No Greek\r\nor Roman author mentions them, and it is not before the tenth century\r\nthat Arab writers take notice of Baku and its wonders. When the\r\nSassanides restored the religion of Zoroaster, the attention of these\r\nfire-worshipping princes was naturally directed to a place where fire\r\ngushes pure and unbidden from the earth. They raised a temple on the\r\nspot, and thousands of pilgrims wandered to the holy fires of Baku. But\r\nwhen the fanatical Arabs overthrew the Persian Empire, times of\r\npersecution and distress began for the Parsees; and still later they\r\nwere almost entirely extirpated by the hordes of Tamerlane. During the\r\nlast centuries fire-worshipping was again introduced by the Indians,\r\nwho, after the Sefides had ascended the Persian throne, gradually\r\nsettled in the Caspian provinces, and whose number must have been\r\nconsiderable, as travellers inform us that in the latter half of the\r\nseventeenth century 200 rich Indian merchants were residing in the town\r\nof Schemachi. But the anarchical times which followed the usurpation of\r\nNadir Schah forced most of these Indians to leave their adopted country,\r\nand since then only solitary pilgrims have found their way to Baku. But\r\nthe number even of these is constantly diminishing, although the\r\nRussians, to whom the sanctuary now belongs, allow them full freedom of\r\naccess. When Koch was at Baku, he found there only five Indians from\r\nMooltan, whither the majority would gladly have returned, had they but\r\npossessed the necessary means. Their squalid appearance and tattered\r\nraiment formed the strongest imaginable contrast to the splendour of the\r\nelement they worshipped. Among them was a Fakir, who had made a vow\r\nconstantly to remain in the same position absorbed in religious\r\ncontemplation, and who for sixteen years had never moved from the spot.\r\n\r\nThe burning springs gush out not only from the ground near the temple\r\nand in other parts of the peninsula of Abscheron, but even from the\r\nbottom of the neighbouring Caspian Sea; and as Sir Charles Lyell saw\r\ncarburetted hydrogen rise in countless bubbles through the crystal\r\nwaters above the falls of the Niagara, and shoot up in bright flames at\r\nthe approach of a light, so Dr. Abich mentions a spot in the Gulf of\r\nBaku where the inflammable gas issues with such force, and in so great a\r\nquantity, from the bottom, which is there three fathoms deep, that a\r\nsmall boat is in danger of being overturned when coming too near it.\r\n\r\nAs gas springs most frequently occur in districts which have been the\r\nformer seats of volcanic action, and as similar exhalations often arise\r\nfrom still active craters, they are supposed by many geologists to be\r\nthe last remaining traces of an expiring volcanic energy. Bischoff\r\nconsiders the carbonic acid of the German gas springs to be developed by\r\nthe decomposition of carbonate of lime by volcanic heat or heated water.\r\n\r\nA phenomenon which is sometimes found connected with gas springs is that\r\nof the mud volcanoes, which may be described as cones of a ductile,\r\nunctuous clay, formed by the continued evolution of a sulphurous and\r\ninflammable gas, spurting up waves and lumps of liquid mud. These\r\nremarkable cauldrons are found in many parts of the world, in the Island\r\nof Milo, in Italy, in Iceland, in India, about 120 miles from the mouths\r\nof the Indus, on the coast of Arracan, in Birmah, in Java, Columbia,\r\nNicaragua, and Trinidad, but probably nowhere on a grander scale than at\r\neither extremity of the chain of the Caucasus, towards the Caspian on\r\nthe east and the Sea of Azof on the west, where in the peninsula of\r\nTaman, and on the opposite coast of the Crimea, near Kertsch, vast\r\nnumbers of mud volcanoes are scattered, some of them 250 feet high.\r\nTheir operations have apparently been going on for countless ages, and\r\nhave covered a great extent of land with their products.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MUD VOLCANOES OF TRINIDAD.]\r\n\r\nThe Macaluba, in Sicily, which owes its name to the Arabs, is the mud\r\nvolcano most anciently known. It is mentioned by Plato in his ‘Phædon,’\r\nand has been described by Strabo. It is situated five miles to the north\r\nof Girgenti, on a hill of a conical shape, truncated at the top, and 150\r\nfeet high. The summit is a plain half a mile round, and the whole\r\nsurface is covered with thick mud. The depth of the mud, which is\r\nsupposed to be immense, is unknown. There is not the slightest\r\nappearance of vegetation upon it. In the rainy season the mud is much\r\nsoftened; the surface is even, and there is a general ebullition over\r\nit, which is accompanied with a very sensible rumbling noise. In the dry\r\nseason the mud acquires greater consistency, but its motion still goes\r\non. The plain assumes a form somewhat convex; a number of little cones\r\nare thrown up, which rarely rise to the height of two feet. Each of them\r\nhas a crater, where black mud is seen in constant agitation, and\r\nincessantly emitting bubbles of air. With these the mud insensibly\r\nrises, and as soon as the crater is full of it, it disgorges. The\r\nresidue sinks, and the cone has a free crater, until a new emission\r\ntakes place.\r\n\r\nSuch is the ordinary state of the Macaluba; but from time to time the\r\nhill becomes subject to alarming convulsions. Slight earthquake shocks\r\nare felt at the distance of two or three miles, accompanied with\r\ninternal noises resembling thunder. These increase for several days, and\r\nare followed at last by a prodigious spout of mud, earth, and stones,\r\nwhich rises two or three hundred feet in the air.\r\n\r\nSimilar paroxysmal explosions have been observed in the Caucasian mud\r\nvolcanoes. In February 1794, the Obu, in the peninsula of Taman, had an\r\neruption accompanied with a dreadful noise, and an earthquake which\r\nradiated from the cone, and was felt as far as Ekaterinodor, at a\r\ndistance of fifty-five leagues. At the beginning of the eruption flames\r\nwere seen, which rose to a prodigious height, and lasted about half an\r\nhour. At the same time dense clouds of smoke escaped from the crater,\r\nand mud and stones were cast up to the height of 3,000 feet. Six streams\r\nof mud, the largest of which was half a mile long, flowed from the\r\nvolcano, and their volume is said to have been equal to twenty-two\r\nmillions of cubic feet.\r\n\r\nViolent eruptive symptoms accompanied the formation of a new mud volcano\r\nin the vicinity of Baku on the Caspian. On November 27, 1827, flames\r\nblazed up to an extraordinary height for three hours, and continued for\r\ntwenty hours more to rise about three feet above a crater from which mud\r\nwas ejected. At another point in the same district, where flames issued,\r\nfragments of rock, of large size, were hurled up into the air and\r\nscattered around.\r\n\r\nThe phenomena exhibited by the Macaluba and other mud cauldrons are\r\ncertainly very distinct from those of true volcanoes, since no scoriæ or\r\nlava or heated matters of any kind are sent forth, the mud being\r\ndescribed as cold when emitted, although the gas, whose violent escape\r\nthrows it up, is sometimes ignited. Hence geologists commonly regard\r\nthese phenomena as entirely distinct from the volcanic, and ascribe\r\ntheir origin to chemical action going on at no great depth beneath the\r\nsurface, among the constituents of certain stratified matters; while\r\nother scientific authorities declare them to be as much connected with\r\ninternal igneous agency as any other eruptive phenomena. Their\r\noccurrence in districts not remote from the sites of vast volcanic\r\ndisturbance, and their occasional violent paroxysms, certainly afford\r\nmuch support to this view, and show that it is probably the same power,\r\nin different degrees of energy, which casts up the mud of the Macaluba\r\nand pours forth the lava-streams of Cotopaxi.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IX.\r\n                              EARTHQUAKES.\r\n\r\nExtent of Misery inflicted by great Earthquakes—Earthquake Regions—\r\n  Earthquakes in England—Great Number of Earthquakes—Vertical and\r\n  undulatory Shocks—Warnings of Earthquakes—Sounds attending\r\n  Earthquakes—Remarkable Displacements of Objects—Extent and Force of\r\n  Seismic Wave Motion—Effects of Earthquakes on the Sea—Enormous Waves\r\n  on Coasts—Oscillations of the Ocean—Fissures, Landslips, and\r\n  shattering Falls of Rock caused by Earthquakes—Causes of Earthquakes—\r\n  Probable Depth of Focus—Opinions of Sir Charles Lyell and Mr. Poulett\r\n  Scrope—Impressions produced on Man and Animals by Earthquakes.\r\n\r\nOf all the destructive agencies of nature there is none to equal the\r\nearthquake. The hurricane is comparatively weak in its fury; the\r\nvolcanic eruption generally confines its rage to the neighbourhood of\r\nthe labouring mountain, but a great earthquake may cover a whole land\r\nwith ruins.\r\n\r\nThe terrible subterranean revolution which convulsed all Asia Minor and\r\nSyria in the reign of Tiberius, destroyed twelve celebrated cities in a\r\nsingle night. The sun, which on setting had gilded their temples and\r\npalaces with his parting rays, beheld them prostrate on the following\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\nIn A.D. 115 Antioch was the centre of a great commotion. The city was\r\nfull of soldiers under Trajan; heavy thunder, excessive winds, and\r\nsubterranean noises were heard; the earth shook, the houses fell; the\r\ncries of people buried in the ruins passed unheeded. The Emperor leaped\r\nfrom a window, while mountains were broken and thrown down, and rivers\r\ndisappeared, and were replaced by others in a new situation. Four\r\ncenturies later (May 20, 526) the same doomed city was totally subverted\r\nby an earthquake, when it is reported that 250,000 persons perished.\r\n\r\nSimilar catastrophes, in which thousands and thousands of victims were\r\nsuddenly destroyed, have frequently occurred in Peru and Chili, in the\r\nWest Indies and Central America, in the Moluccas and Java, in the\r\ncountries bordering on the Mediterranean and the Red Sea; but a bare\r\nmention of the loss of life conveys but a faint idea of the extent of\r\nmisery inflicted by one of those great earthquakes which mark with an\r\nominous shade many large tracts of the earth’s surface.\r\n\r\nWe must picture to ourselves the slow lingering death which is the fate\r\nof many—some buried alive, others burnt in the fire which almost\r\ninvariably bursts out in a city where hundreds of dwellings have\r\nsuddenly been laid prostrate—the numbers who escaped with loss of limbs\r\nor serious bodily injuries, and the surviving multitude, suddenly\r\nreduced to penury and want.\r\n\r\nIn the Calabrian earthquake of 1783, it is supposed that about a fourth\r\npart of the inhabitants of Polistena and of some other towns were buried\r\nalive, and might have been saved had there been no want of hands; but in\r\nso general a calamity, where each was occupied with his own misfortunes\r\nor those of his family, help could seldom be procured. ‘It frequently\r\nhappened,’ says Sir Charles Lyell, ‘that persons in search of those most\r\ndear to them could hear their moans, could recognise their voices, were\r\ncertain of the exact spot where they lay buried beneath their feet, yet\r\ncould afford them no succour. The piled mass resisted all their\r\nstrength, and rendered their efforts of no avail. At Terranuova four\r\nAugustin monks, who had taken refuge in a vaulted sacristy, the arch of\r\nwhich continued to support a vast pile of ruins, made their cries heard\r\nfor the space of four days. One only of the brethren of the whole\r\nconvent was saved, and of what avail was his strength to remove the\r\nenormous weight of rubbish which had overwhelmed his companions? He\r\nheard their voices die away gradually, and when afterwards their four\r\ncorpses were disinterred, they were found clasped in each other’s arms.’\r\n\r\nAffecting narratives are preserved of mothers saved after the fifth,\r\nsixth, and even seventh day of their interment, when their infants or\r\nchildren had perished with hunger. In his work on the great Neapolitan\r\nearthquake of 1857, Mr. Mallet, from innumerable narratives of personal\r\nperil and sad adventure, selects the distressing case of a noble family\r\nof Monte Murro, as affording a vivid picture of the terrors of an\r\nearthquake night. Don Andrea del Fino, the owner of one of the few\r\nhouses in the city which escaped total destruction, was with his wife in\r\nbed, his daughter sleeping in an adjacent chamber on the principal\r\nfloor. At the first shock his wife, who was awake, leaped from bed, and\r\nimmediately after, a mass of the vaulting above came down, and buried\r\nher sleeping husband. At the same moment, the vault above their\r\ndaughter’s room fell in upon her. From the light and hollow construction\r\nof the vaults neither was at once killed. The signora escaped by leaping\r\nfrom the front window, she scarcely knew how. For more than two hours\r\nshe wandered, unnoticed, amongst the mass of terrified survivors in the\r\nstreets, before she could obtain aid from her own tenants and\r\ndependants, to extricate her husband. They got him out after more than\r\neighteen hours’ entombment—alive, indeed, but maimed and lame for life.\r\nHis daughter was dead. As he lay longing despairingly for release from\r\nthe rubbish, which a second shock, an hour after the first, had so\r\nshaken and closed in around him that he could scarcely breathe, he\r\nheard, but a few feet off, her agonising cries and groans grow fainter\r\nand fainter, until at last they died away. His wife, to whose devotion\r\nhis own life was owing, had escaped unhurt.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately man too often vies with the brute forces of nature to\r\nincrease the horrors of a great earthquake. As the arm of the law is\r\nparalysed by the general panic, thieves and ruffians are not slow to\r\navail themselves of their opportunity. Thus in the Calabrian catastrophe\r\nof 1783, nothing could be more atrocious than the conduct of the\r\npeasants, who abandoned the farms and flocked in great numbers into the\r\ntowns—not to rescue their countrymen from a lingering death, but to\r\nplunder. They dashed through the streets amid tottering walls and clouds\r\nof dust, trampling beneath their feet the bodies of the wounded and half\r\nburied, and often stripping them, while yet living, of their clothes.\r\n\r\nFrom the vast ruin and misery they entail, it is evident that where\r\nearthquakes are frequent, there can never be perfect security of\r\nproperty even under the best government; and as the fruits collected by\r\nthe labour of many years may be lost in an instant, the progress of\r\ncivilisation and national wealth must necessarily be retarded.\r\n\r\n‘Earthquakes alone,’ says Mr. Darwin, ‘are sufficient to destroy the\r\nprosperity of any country. If beneath England the now inert subterranean\r\nforces should exert those powers which most assuredly in former\r\ngeological ages they have exerted, how completely would the entire\r\ncondition of the land be changed! What would become of the lofty houses,\r\nthickly packed cities, great manufactories, the beautiful public and\r\nprivate edifices? If the new period of disturbance were first to\r\ncommence by some great earthquake in the dead of the night, how terrific\r\nwould be the carnage! England would at once be bankrupt; all papers,\r\nrecords, and accounts would from that moment be lost. Government, being\r\nunable to collect the taxes, and failing to maintain its authority, the\r\nhand of violence and rapine would remain uncontrolled. In every large\r\ntown famine would go forth, pestilence and death following in its\r\ntrain.’\r\n\r\nFortunately the experience of many ages shows that the regions subject\r\nto these terrible catastrophes are confined to a comparatively small\r\npart of the surface of the globe. Thus Southern Italy and Sicily; the\r\ntract embracing the Canaries, the Azores, Portugal, and Morocco; Asia\r\nMinor, Syria, and the Caucasus; the Arabian shore of the Red Sea; the\r\nEast Indian Archipelago; the West Indies, Nicaragua, Quito, Peru, and\r\nChili, are particularly liable to destructive shocks.\r\n\r\nBut beyond these limits slighter earthquakes are of far more common\r\noccurrence than is generally supposed, and probably they leave no part\r\nof the world entirely undisturbed. From the year 1821 to 1830 no less\r\nthan 115 earthquakes have been felt to the north of the Alps, and since\r\nthe year 1089, 225 are cited in the annals of England. Some of these\r\nearthquakes seem to have but just stopped at the point when a slight\r\nincrease of their force would have covered the land with ruins. In 1574,\r\non the 26th of February, between five and six in the evening, an\r\nearthquake was felt at York, Worcester, Hereford, Gloucester, and\r\nBristol. Norton Chapel was filled with worshippers; they were nearly all\r\noverthrown, and fled in terror, thinking that the dead were unearthed or\r\nthat the chapel was falling. Six years later, on the 6th of April, at 6\r\nP.M., all England was thrown into consternation. The great bell at\r\nWestminster began to toll; the students at the Temple started up from\r\ntable and rushed into the street, knives in hand; a part of the Temple\r\nChurch fell, and stones dropped from St. Paul’s. Two stones fell in\r\nChrist’s Church, and crushed two persons. In rushing out of the church\r\nmany were lamed, and there was a shower of chimneys in the streets. At\r\nSandwich, the occurrence was marked by the violence of the sea, which\r\nmade ships run foul of each other; and at Dover a part of the\r\nfortifications fell with the rock which supported it.\r\n\r\nOn the 6th October 1863, a movement, though gentle when compared to the\r\npreceding instances, was felt from the English Channel to the Mersey,\r\nand from Hereford to Leamington and Oxford. The Malvern range was about\r\nthe centre of the area, as it has often been before. Even in alluvial\r\nHolland, six or eight slight earthquakes have been felt during the last\r\ncentury. The industrious researches of Kluge show that, during the eight\r\nyears from 1850 to 1857, no less than 4,620 earthquakes—a great\r\nproportion of which (509) fell to the share of Southern Europe—have been\r\nnoticed in both hemispheres; and when we remember that a very\r\nconsiderable part of the globe is still either totally unknown or\r\nremoved by the barbarous condition of its inhabitants from all\r\nintercourse with the scientific world, and that, consequently, the above\r\nlist must necessarily be incomplete, it is very probable that not a day\r\npasses without some agitation of the surface of the earth in some place\r\nor other.\r\n\r\nA violent earthquake almost always consists of several shocks following\r\neach other in rapid succession. Sometimes they are preceded by slighter\r\nvibrations; at other times they suddenly convulse the land without any\r\nprevious notice. In most instances, each shock lasts but a few seconds;\r\nbut this is enough to ruin the work of ages. Three violent commotions\r\nwithin five minutes destroyed the town of Caraccas on March 26, 1812;\r\nand the earthquake which, in 1692, desolated Jamaica lasted but three\r\nminutes. On January 11, 1839, two shocks within thirty seconds covered\r\nMartinique, and the whole range of the Lesser Antilles, with ruins. But\r\na violent earthquake, though itself but of short duration, is generally\r\nfollowed by a series of secondary shocks, which are repeated at\r\ngradually widening intervals and with decreasing energy, so that if\r\nthese subsequent tremors be taken into account, it may often be said to\r\nlast for weeks, or even months. Thus, to cite but one instance, the\r\nearthquake of October 21, 1766, destroyed the whole town of Cumana in a\r\nfew minutes, but during the following fourteen months the earth was in a\r\nconstant vibratory motion, and scarce an hour passed without a shock\r\nbeing felt.\r\n\r\nIn countries where earthquakes are comparatively rare (for instance in\r\nthe south of Europe) the belief is very general that oppressive heat,\r\nstillness of the air, and a misty horizon are always forerunners of the\r\nphenomenon. But this popular opinion is not confirmed by the experience\r\nof trustworthy observers, who have lived for years in countries such as\r\nCumana, Quito, Peru, and Chili, where the ground trembles frequently and\r\nviolently. Humboldt experienced earthquakes during every state of the\r\nweather, serene and dry, rainy and stormy.\r\n\r\nBrute animals, being more sensitive than men of the slightest movement\r\nof the earth, are said to evince extraordinary alarm, and it has been\r\noften observed that even the dull hog shows symptoms of uneasiness\r\nprevious to the shock. During the great Neapolitan earthquake of 1857 an\r\nunusual halo-like light was seen in the sky before, and not long before,\r\nthe shock. Mr. Mallet was at first inclined to look upon this notion as\r\na superstitious tale; but, finding it widely diffused in a country where\r\ncommunication is bad and news travels slowly, no longer doubted that it\r\nwas founded on fact.[10] Conjectures would be useless as to its nature,\r\nbut future observation directed to the point may determine whether some\r\nsort of auroral light may emanate from the vast depths of rock formation\r\nunder the enormous tensions and compressions that must precede the final\r\ncrash and rupture; or whether volcanic action, going on in the unseen\r\ndepths below, may give rise to powerful disturbances of electric\r\nequilibrium, and hence to the development of light; just as from\r\nvolcanic mountains in eruption lightnings continually flash from the\r\nhuge volumes of steam and floating ashes above the crater. Humboldt is\r\nalso of opinion that, though in general the revolutions which take place\r\nbelow the surface of the earth are not announced beforehand by any\r\nmeteorological process, or a peculiar appearance of the sky, it is not\r\nimprobable that during violent shocks some change may occur in the\r\ncondition of the atmosphere. Thus, during the earthquake in the\r\nPiedmontese valleys of Pelis and Clusson, great alterations were\r\nobserved in the electrical tension of the atmosphere without any\r\nappearance of a thunder-storm.\r\n\r\nFootnote 10:\r\n\r\n  Mallet, ‘The Great Neapolitan Earthquake of 1857,’ vol. i. p. 323.\r\n\r\nEarthquakes are generally attended with sounds, sometimes like the\r\nhowling of a storm, or the rumbling of subterranean thunder, at others\r\nlike the clashing of iron chains, or as if a number of heavily laden\r\nwaggons were rolling rapidly over the pavement, or as if enormous masses\r\nof glass were suddenly shivered to pieces. As solid bodies are excellent\r\nconductors of sound (burnt clay, for instance, propagating it ten or\r\ntwelve times more rapidly than the air), the subterranean noise may be\r\nheard at a vast distance from the primary seat of the earthquake. In\r\nCaraccas, in the grass-plains of Calabozo, and on the banks of the Rio\r\nApure, which falls into the Orinoco, a dreadful thunder-like sound was\r\neverywhere heard on April 30, 1812, without any simultaneous trembling\r\nof the earth, at the time when, at the distance of 158 geographical\r\nmiles, the volcano of St. Vincent, in the Lesser Antilles, was pouring\r\nout of its crater a mighty lava-stream. This was, according to distance,\r\nas if an eruption of Vesuvius were heard in the north of France. In the\r\nyear 1744, during the great eruption of the volcano Cotopaxi, a\r\nsubterranean noise like the firing of cannon was heard at Honda on the\r\nMagdalena river. But the crater of Cotopaxi is 17,000 feet higher than\r\nHonda, and both points, situated at a distance of 109 geographical\r\nmiles, are moreover separated by the colossal mountain masses of Quito,\r\nPasto, and Popayan, and by numberless ravines and deep valleys. The\r\nsound was certainly transmitted, not through the air, but through the\r\nearth, and must have proceeded from a very considerable depth.\r\n\r\nBut noise is not the necessary attendant of an earthquake, for many\r\ninstances are known in which the most violent shocks have been\r\ncompletely noiseless. No subterranean sounds were heard during the\r\nterrific earthquake which destroyed Riobamba on February 4, 1797, and\r\nthe same circumstance is mentioned in the narratives of many of the\r\nChilian earthquakes.\r\n\r\nThe phenomenon of sound, when unaccompanied by any perceptible\r\nvibration, makes a peculiarly deep impression on the mind, even of those\r\nwho have long inhabited a country subject to frequent earthquakes. They\r\ntremble at the idea of the catastrophe which may follow. A remarkable\r\ninstance of a long protracted noise without any trembling of the earth\r\noccurred in 1784, at the wealthy mining town of Guanaxuato in Mexico,\r\nwhere the rolling of subterranean thunder, with now and then a louder\r\ncrash, was heard for more than a month, without the slightest shock,\r\neither on the surface of the earth, or in the neighbouring silver mines,\r\nwhich are 1,500 feet deep. The noise was confined to a small space, so\r\nthat a few miles from the town it was no longer audible. Never before\r\nhad this phenomenon been known to occur in the Mexican highlands, nor\r\nhas it been repeated since.\r\n\r\nEarthquake shocks are either vertical or undulatory. A vertical shock,\r\nwhich is felt immediately above the seat or focus of the subterranean\r\ndisturbance, causes a movement up and down. Like an exploding mine, it\r\nfrequently jerks movable bodies high up into the air. Thus, during the\r\ngreat earthquake of Riobamba, the bodies of many of the inhabitants were\r\nthrown upon the hill of La Culla, which rises to the height of several\r\nhundred feet at the other side of the Lican torrent; and during the\r\nearthquake of Chili in 1837, a large mast, planted thirty feet deep in\r\nthe ground at Fort San Carlos, and propped with iron bars, was thrown\r\nupwards, so that a round hole remained behind.\r\n\r\nAlthough to the inhabitants of a shaken district the undulatory wave or\r\nvibration of an earthquake appears to radiate horizontally outwards from\r\nthe spot on the surface where it is first felt, the force does not\r\nreally operate in a horizontal direction, like a wave caused by a pebble\r\non the surface of a pond; for at every point, except that immediately\r\nabove the focus of the shock, it comes up obliquely from below, causing\r\nthe ground to move forwards and then backwards in a, more or less\r\nhorizontal direction. As a ship, yielding to the oscillatory movements\r\nof the waves, alternately inclines to one side or the other, so, during\r\nthe more violent undulations of the soil, the objects on its surface are\r\nmomentarily moved from their vertical position, and often considerably\r\ninclined towards the horizon. Thus during the great earthquake which\r\nconvulsed the valley of the Mississippi in 1811–12, Mr. Bringier, an\r\nengineer of New Orleans, who was on horseback near New Madrid, where\r\nsome of the severest shocks were experienced, saw the trees bend as the\r\nwave-motion of the earthquake passed under them, and immediately\r\nafterwards recover their position. The transit of the wave through the\r\nwoods was marked by the crash of countless branches, first heard on one\r\nside and then on the other. It must have been awful to see the giants of\r\nthe forest thus move to and fro like a corn-field agitated by the wind!\r\n\r\nVery remarkable displacements of objects are not seldom caused by\r\nearthquakes, such as the rotation of the blocks of columns or the\r\nturning of statues on their pedestals.\r\n\r\nAt Lima, which, owing to its repeated destructions by earthquakes, is\r\nproperly a city of ruins, Professor Dana saw two obelisks with the upper\r\nstone on each displaced and turned round on its axis about fifteen\r\ndegrees in a direction from north to east. These rotations by\r\nearthquakes have been attributed by some authors to an actual rotatory\r\nmovement in the earthquake vibration; but it has lately been shown by\r\nMr. Mallet that this hypothesis is untenable and unnecessary, as a\r\nsimple vibration back and forth is all that is required to produce a\r\nrotatory motion in the stone of a column, provided that stone be\r\nattached below more strongly on one side of the centre than on the\r\nopposite.\r\n\r\nThe wave-motion of an earthquake sometimes spreads over enormous spaces.\r\nThe shocks of the earthquake of New Granada which took place in the\r\nnight from the 16th to the 17th of June 1826, were noticed over a\r\nsurface of 750,000 square miles. The earthquake of Valdivia (February\r\n20, 1835) was felt southwards on the distant island of Chiloe to the\r\nnorth as far as Copiapo, in Mendoza to the east of the Andes, and on the\r\nIsland of Juan Fernandez, 300 miles from the coast. Supposing these\r\neffects to have taken place at corresponding distances in Europe, all\r\nthe land would have trembled from the North Sea to the Mediterranean,\r\nand from Ireland to the centre of France.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that the extent and force of the wave-motion of an\r\nearthquake must in a great measure depend upon the nature of the rocks\r\nthrough which it is transmitted. It will vibrate more easily through\r\nsolid homogeneous masses, while in alluvial deposits, or in a soil\r\ncomposed of sand and loose conglomerate, its undulations will be\r\npropagated irregularly and its effects be far more destructive. This is\r\nparticularly the case where the alluvial deposits repose on a substratum\r\nof hard rock. Thus the devastations of the Calabrian earthquake of 1783\r\nwere most apparent in the plain of Oppido, in those parts where the\r\nnewer tertiary strata rest upon granite. The earthquake wave generally\r\nfollows the direction of mountain-chains, and but rarely crosses them.\r\nThe great Chilian earthquakes, which often propagate their vibrations to\r\ndistances of many hundred miles along the western foot of the Andes,\r\nremain unfelt on their eastern border; while the earthquakes along the\r\nshores of Venezuela, Caraccas, and New Granada rarely transmit their\r\nvibrations beyond the high mountain-chains which run parallel with the\r\ncoast. This is probably due to the numerous dislocations, rents, and\r\ncaverns which are produced by the elevation of the mountain-chains, and\r\nnecessarily serve as barriers to the propagation of the earthquake wave.\r\n\r\nSevere earthquakes are not seldom accompanied by a violent agitation of\r\nthe sea. First, at the instant of the shock, the water swells high up on\r\nthe beach with a gentle motion, and then as quietly recedes; secondly,\r\nsome time afterwards, the whole body of the sea retires from the coast,\r\nand then returns in waves of overwhelming force. The first movement\r\nseems to be an immediate consequence of the earthquake affecting\r\ndifferently a fluid and a solid, so that their respective levels are\r\nslightly deranged; but the second is a far more important phenomenon.\r\n‘Some authors,’ says Mr. Darwin, ‘have attempted to explain it by\r\nsupposing that the sea retains its level, while the land oscillates\r\nupwards; but surely the water close to the land, even on a rather steep\r\ncoast, would partake of the motion of the bottom; moreover, similar\r\nmovements of the sea have occurred at islands far distant from the chief\r\nline of disturbance. I suspect (but the subject is a very obscure one)\r\nthat a wave, however produced, _first draws the water from the shore_ on\r\nwhich it is advancing to break. I have observed that this happens with\r\nthe little waves from the paddles of a steamboat. From the great wave\r\nnot immediately following the earthquake, but sometimes after the\r\ninterval of even half-an-hour, and from distant islands being affected\r\nsimilarly with the coasts near the focus of the disturbance, it appears\r\nthat the wave first rises in the offing, and, as this is of general\r\noccurrence, the cause must be general. I suspect we must look to the\r\nline where the less disturbed waters of the deep ocean join the water\r\nnearer the coast which has partaken of the movements of the land, as the\r\nplace where the great wave is first generated; it would also appear that\r\nthe wave is larger or smaller according to the extent of shoal water\r\nwhich has been agitated together with the bottom on which it rested.’\r\n\r\nThe following examples sufficiently prove that no storm, however\r\nviolent, is capable of raising such prodigious waves as an earthquake.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1692 the town of Kingston in Jamaica was almost totally\r\ndestroyed by a huge earthquake wave. A frigate which lay in port was\r\ncarried forwards over the houses and stranded in the middle of the town.\r\nIn his ‘Principles of Geology,’ Sir Charles Lyell relates that, during\r\nthe Calabrian earthquake of 1783 the Prince of Scilla had persuaded a\r\ngreat part of his vassals to betake themselves to their fishing boats\r\nfor safety, and he himself had gone on board. On the night of February\r\n5, when some of the people were sleeping in the boats, and others on a\r\nlevel plain slightly elevated above the sea, the earth rocked and large\r\nmasses of rock were thrown down with a dreadful crash upon the plain.\r\nImmediately afterwards the sea, rising more than twenty feet above the\r\nlevel of this low tract, rolled foaming over it and swept away the\r\nmultitude. It then retreated, but soon rushed back again with greater\r\nviolence, bringing back with it some of the bodies it had carried away.\r\nAt the same time every boat was sunk or dashed against the beach, and\r\nsome of them were swept far inland. The aged prince was killed, with\r\n1,430 of his people.\r\n\r\nAfter the earthquake which devastated the town of Lima on the 28th of\r\nOctober 1746, the sea rose on the evening of the same day eighty feet\r\nabove its usual level in the neighbouring Bay of Callao, overwhelmed the\r\ntown, and destroyed nearly all the inhabitants. Of the twenty-three\r\nships which were lying in the harbour at the time, nineteen immediately\r\nsank, while the four others were thrown upon the land at the distance of\r\nnearly a league.\r\n\r\nShortly after the shock which desolated Chili on the 20th of February\r\n1835, a great wave was seen from the distance of three or four miles,\r\napproaching in the middle of the Bay of Talcahuano with a smooth\r\noutline, but tearing up cottages and trees along the shore, as it swept\r\nonwards with irresistible force. At the head of the bay it broke in a\r\nfearful line of white breakers, which rushed up to a height of twenty-\r\nthree vertical feet above the highest spring tides. Their force must\r\nhave been prodigious, for at the Fort a cannon with its carriage,\r\nestimated at four tons in weight, was moved fifteen feet inwards. The\r\nwhole coast was strewed over with timber and furniture, as if a thousand\r\nships had been wrecked. As Mr. Darwin walked along the shore, he\r\nobserved that numerous fragments of rock, which, from the marine\r\nproductions adhering to them, must recently have been lying in deep\r\nwater, had been cast up high on the beach. One of these was six feet\r\nlong, three broad, and two thick.\r\n\r\nDuring the dreadful earthquake which in 1868 raised the strip of land at\r\nthe western foot of the Andes from Iburra in Ecuador, to Iquique in\r\nPeru, 1,200 miles in length, the receding sea uncovered the bay at\r\nIquique to the depth of four fathoms, and then, returning in an immense\r\nwave, a mass of dark blue water, forty feet high, rushed over the\r\nalready ruined city, and swept away every trace of what had been a town.\r\nOne spectator, seeing the whole surface of the sea rise like a mountain,\r\nran for his life to the Pampa. The waves overtook him. Fighting with the\r\ndark water, amidst wreck and ruin of every kind, carried back into the\r\nbay, and again thrown back to the Pampa, wounded and half-naked, he\r\ncrept for safety into a hole of the sand, and waited sadly for the dawn.\r\nAt Arica, the British Vice-Consul, alarmed at the first shock, rushed\r\nout of the house with his family, and made for the high ground, in just\r\nterror of the expected sea-wave. Through the ruined town, amidst dead\r\nand dying, half stifled with dust, they reached rising ground, and,\r\nlooking back, saw a dreadful sequel—the sea rushed in and left not a\r\nvestige remaining of the lower part of Arica. Six vessels were lost in\r\nthe bay or tossed over rocks and houses; an American gunboat was whirled\r\naway from her moorings, and laid, without a broken spar or tarnished\r\nflag, high and dry on the sand-hills, a quarter of a mile from the sea.\r\n\r\nAs might be expected from the movable nature of water, the wave-motion\r\nof earthquakes is frequently propagated to surprising distances over the\r\nsea. The Chilian earthquake of 1835 produced oscillations of the ocean\r\nthat made themselves felt on the Sandwich Islands at a distance of 5,000\r\nnautical miles. On Mauai, the sea retreated 120 feet, and then suddenly\r\nreturned with a tremendous wave that swept away the trees and houses on\r\nthe beach. In Hawaii, a large congregation had assembled for divine\r\nservice near Byron’s Bay. Suddenly the water began to sink, so that soon\r\na great part of the harbour was laid dry. The spectators hurried to the\r\nshore to admire the astonishing spectacle, when a wave, rising twenty\r\nfeet above the usual tide-mark, inundated the land, destroyed sixty-six\r\nhuts, and drowned eleven of the islanders, though the best swimmers in\r\nthe world. So far from its starting-point did the South American\r\nearthquake seek its victims. Fifteen hours and a half after the great\r\nearthquake of Arica (1868) the water-wave undulating over the vast\r\nPacific was felt at Chatham Islands, a distance of 6,300 miles, and an\r\nhour later at New Zealand.\r\n\r\nThe enormous powers which come into action during a great earthquake\r\nshow themselves not only in the destruction of edifices and the wide-\r\nspread ruin so produced, but in the changes which they effect in the\r\nconfiguration of the soil. Wherever masses of earth rest loosely upon a\r\nsloped surface of subjacent rock, or where steep mountain crests overlie\r\nwet and unctuous beds of shale, or where the rock itself is composed of\r\ncoherent material, or where river-banks are formed of precipitous masses\r\nof clays, or where the corroding waters have undermined the ground, the\r\nviolent commotion caused by an earthquake cannot fail to produce\r\nlandslips, fissures, and falls of rock. In 1571, on the 17th of\r\nFebruary, the ground opened all at once at the ‘Wonder,’ near Putley,\r\nnot far from Marcle in Herefordshire; and a large part of the sloping\r\nsurface of the hill—twenty-six acres, it is said—descended with the\r\ntrees and sheep-folds, and continued in motion from Saturday to Monday,\r\nmasses of ground being turned round through half a circle in their\r\ndescent. This was a great landslip, said to have been occasioned by an\r\nearthquake.\r\n\r\nEarth-fissures were formerly supposed to be occasioned by a _stretching_\r\nof the ground, occasioned by the wavy nature of the shocks; but Mr.\r\nMallet has shown that no earthquake wave can possibly produce any such\r\nstretching, and considers them as cases of small and incipient landslips\r\ncaused by the shaking downwards of a loose mass. His own observations\r\nleft no doubt in his mind that the descriptions, given by the Neapolitan\r\nAcademy in their Historical Account of the Earthquake of 1783, of the\r\nearth-fissures therein produced, and designated constantly by the\r\npompous term ‘voragines,’ are gross exaggerations, and that the well-\r\nknown Jamaica earth-fissures, that were said to have opened and closed\r\nwith the wave, and to have _bitten people in two_, must be regarded as\r\naudacious fables.\r\n\r\n‘The vulgar mind, filled from infancy with superstitious terrors as to\r\n“the things under the earth,” is seized at once by the notion of these\r\nfissures of profound and fabulous depth with fire and vapour of smoke\r\nissuing from within their murky abysses; but they should cease to belong\r\nto science.’\r\n\r\nEnormous landslips are sometimes occasioned by earthquakes, but their\r\nextent depends less upon the power and energy of the shock than upon the\r\nconditions of unstable equilibrium presented by great masses of loose\r\nmaterial, through the configuration of the country. In consequence of\r\nlandslips or dislodgements of large masses of rock, alterations in the\r\nflow or distribution of the waters frequently take place. Thus, brooks\r\nor rivers are not seldom dammed, and temporary ponds or lakes created.\r\n\r\nPermanent elevations of the land have been observed after some\r\nearthquakes. Thus, after the violent shocks of November 19, 1822, a\r\ngreat part of the coast of Chili was found to be raised several feet\r\nabove its previous level, and after the great earthquake which occurred\r\nin New Zealand in the night of January 23, 1855, a large tract of land\r\nwas found to be permanently upraised from one to nine feet. Before the\r\nshock there had been no room to pass between the sea and the base of a\r\nperpendicular cliff called Muka-Muka, except for a short time at low\r\nwater, and the herdsmen were obliged to wait for low tide in order to\r\ndrive their cattle past the cliff. But immediately after the upheaval, a\r\ngently sloping raised beach, more than 100 feet wide, was laid dry,\r\naffording ample space at all states of the tide for the passage of man\r\nand beast.\r\n\r\nThese permanent elevations have often been attributed to the immediate\r\nagency of earthquakes; but Mr. Mallet proves this assumption to be a\r\nfallacy, as the impulse of the earthquake wave even right above the\r\nfocus is utterly incapable of raising the level of the land by a height\r\nmuch more than instrumentally appreciable, and there is not the least\r\nevidence that any part of even this elevation is permanent. That\r\nearthquakes occur along with, and as part of, a train of other\r\ncircumstances which do produce permanent elevation occasionally, and\r\nthat earthquakes are probably always the signals that the forces\r\nproducing elevation are operative, is another matter, with which that\r\nerroneous or loosely expressed view should not be confounded.\r\n\r\nThe causes of earthquakes are still hidden in obscurity, and probably\r\nwill ever remain so, as these violent convulsions originate at depths\r\nfar below the reach of human observation. Mr. Mallet came to the\r\nconclusion that the depth of the original Calabrian shock in 1857 did\r\nnot exceed seven or eight miles, and deduces from all the facts known as\r\nto the movements of earthquakes, that the subterranean points where the\r\nshocks originate perhaps never exceed thirty geographical miles, so\r\nthat, even supposing the central nucleus of the earth to be fluid, they\r\ncannot possibly be due to the reaction of the internal ocean of molten\r\nstone upon the solid shell with which it is enveloped, but must have\r\ntheir seat within the latter. The existence of reservoirs of fused\r\nmatter at various depths in the solid earth-rind is quite sufficient to\r\naccount for all seismic and volcanic phenomena; for it is evident that\r\nwhenever rain-water, or the waters of the sea percolating through rocks,\r\ngain access to these subterranean lakes of molten stone, steam must be\r\ngenerated, the pressure of which will in many cases rend and dislocate\r\nthe incumbent masses.\r\n\r\n‘During such movements,’ says Sir Charles Lyell, ‘fissures may be formed\r\nand injected with gaseous or fluid matter, which may sometimes fail to\r\nreach the surface, while at other times it may be expelled through\r\nvolcanic vents, stufas, and hot springs. When the strain on the rocks\r\nhas caused them to split, or the roofs of pre-existing fissures or\r\ncaverns have been made to fall in, vibratory jars will be produced and\r\npropagated in all directions, like waves of sound through the crust of\r\nthe earth, with varying velocity, according to the violence of the\r\noriginal shock, and the density or elasticity of the substance through\r\nwhich they pass. They will travel, for example, faster through granite\r\nthan through limestone, and more rapidly through the latter than through\r\nwet clay, but the rate will be uniform through the same homogeneous\r\nmedium.’\r\n\r\nAccording to Mr. Poulett Scrope, the originating cause of the earthquake\r\nmust be sought in the expansion of some deeply seated mass of mineral\r\nmatter, owing to augmentation of temperature or diminution of pressure.\r\nBy this expansive force, the solid rocks above are suddenly rent\r\nasunder, and whether below the sea or not, their violent disruption\r\nproduces a jarring vibration, which is propagated on either side through\r\ntheir continuous masses in undulatory pulsations.\r\n\r\nSome geologists are of opinion that earthquakes are frequently the\r\nresult of the subsiding, sinking in, or cracking of subterranean cavern\r\nroofs, in consequence of the pressure of the superincumbent rocks. Small\r\nlocal earthquakes may be explained by this theory; but terrible\r\nconvulsions which shake a whole continent evidently proceed from a far\r\nmore formidable cause, and are more satisfactorily explained by the\r\nagency of subterranean heat and elastic vapours.\r\n\r\nIf, even during an ordinary storm, the black clouds, the howling of the\r\nwind, the flashes of lightning, and the loud claps of thunder strike men\r\nand brutes with fear, we may naturally expect to see terror carried to\r\nits highest pitch by so dreadful a phenomenon as an earthquake. All\r\ncreatures living or burrowing under the earth—rats, mice, moles, snakes—\r\nhastily creep forth from their subterranean abodes, though many no doubt\r\nare gripped and suffocated by the suddenly moved soil before they can\r\neffect their escape; the crocodile, generally silent, like our little\r\nlizards, rushes out of the river and runs bellowing into the woods; the\r\nhogs show symptoms of uneasiness; the horses tremble; the oxen huddle\r\ntogether; and the fowls run about with discordant cries. On man, the\r\nphenomenon makes a peculiarly deep impression.\r\n\r\n‘A bad earthquake,’ says Mr. Darwin, ‘at once destroys our oldest\r\nassociations. The earth, the very emblem of solidity, has moved beneath\r\nour feet like a thin crust over a fluid. One second of time has created\r\nin the mind a strange idea of insecurity, which hours of reflection\r\nwould not have produced.’ We can no longer trust the soil on which we\r\nstand, and feel ourselves completely at the mercy of some unknown\r\ndestructive power, which at any moment, without forewarning, can destroy\r\nour property or our lives. But as first impressions are always the\r\ndeepest, so habit renders man callous even to the terrors of an ordinary\r\nearthquake. In countries where slight shocks are of frequent occurrence,\r\nalmost every vestige of fear vanishes from the minds of the natives, or\r\nof the strangers whom a long residence has familiarised with the\r\nphenomenon.\r\n\r\nOn the rainless coast of Peru, thunderstorms and hail are unknown. The\r\nthunder of the storm is there replaced by the thunder which accompanies\r\nthe earthquake. But the frequent repetition of this subterranean tumult,\r\nand the general belief that dangerous shocks occur only twice or thrice\r\nin the course of a century, produce in Lima so great an indifference\r\ntowards slighter oscillations of the soil that they hardly attract more\r\nattention than a hail-storm in Northern Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER X.\r\n                    THE GREAT EARTHQUAKE OF LISBON.\r\n\r\nA dreadful All Saints’ Day—The Victims of a Minute—Report of an Eye-\r\n  witness—Conflagration—Banditti—Pombal brings Order into Chaos—\r\n  Intrigues of the Jesuits—Damages caused by the Earthquake in other\r\n  Places—at Cadiz—in Barbary—Widespread Alarm—Remarks of Goethe on the\r\n  Earthquake.\r\n\r\n\r\nHistory exhibits few catastrophes more terrible than that which was\r\ncaused by the great earthquake which, on November 1, 1755, levelled the\r\ntown of Lisbon to the dust.

The weather was as\r\nmild and beautiful as on a fine summer’s day in England, when, about\r\nforty minutes past nine, in the morning, an earthquake shock, followed\r\nalmost immediately by another and another, brought down convents,\r\nchurches, palaces, and houses in one common ruin, and, at a very\r\nmoderate computation, occasioned the loss of thirty thousand lives. ‘The\r\nshocking sight of the dead bodies,’ says an eye-witness of the scene,\r\n‘together with the shrieks and cries of those who were half buried in\r\nthe ruins, exceeds all description; for the fear and consternation were\r\nso great that the most resolute person durst not stay a moment to remove\r\na few stones off the friend he loved most, though many might have been\r\nsaved by so doing; but nothing was thought of but self-preservation.\r\nGetting into open places, and into the middle of streets, was the most\r\nprobable security. Such as were in the upper storeys of houses were, in\r\ngeneral, more fortunate than those who attempted to escape by the doors;\r\nfor they were buried under the ruins with the greatest part of the foot-\r\npassengers; such as were in equipages escaped best, though their cattle\r\nand drivers suffered severely; but those lost in houses and the streets\r\nare very unequal in number to those that were buried in the ruins of\r\nchurches; for as it was a day of great devotion, and the time of\r\ncelebrating mass, all the churches in the city were vastly crowded; and\r\nthe number of churches here exceeds that of both London and Westminster;\r\nand as the steeples are built high, they mostly fell with the roof of\r\nthe church, and the stones are so large that few escaped.’[11]\r\n\r\nFootnote 11:\r\n\r\n  Philosophical Transactions, vol. xlix. part i. p. 404.\r\n\r\nMany of those who were not crushed or disabled by the falling buildings\r\nfled to the Tagus, vainly hoping that they might find there the safety\r\nwhich they had lost on land. For, soon after the shock, the sea also\r\ncame rushing in like a torrent, though against wind and tide, and rising\r\nin an enormous wave, overflowed its banks, devouring all it met on its\r\ndestructive path. Many large vessels sank at once; others, torn from\r\ntheir anchors, disappeared in the vortex, or, striking against each\r\nother, were shattered to pieces. A fine new stone quay, where about\r\nthree thousand persons had assembled for safety, slipped into the river,\r\nand every one was lost; nor did so much as a single body appear\r\nafterwards.\r\n\r\nHad the misery ended here, it might in some degree have admitted of\r\nredress; for, though lives could not be restored, yet a great part of\r\nthe immense riches that were in the ruins might have been recovered; but\r\na new calamity soon put an end to such hopes, for, in about two hours\r\nafter the shock, fires broke out in three different parts of the city,\r\ncaused by the goods and the kitchen fires being all jumbled together.\r\nAbout this time also, a fresh gale suddenly springing up, made the fire\r\nrage with such violence that, at the end of three days, the greatest\r\npart of the city was reduced to ashes. What the earthquake had spared\r\nfell a prey to the fire, and the flames consumed thousands of mutilated\r\nvictims, who, incapable of flight, lay half-buried in the ruins.\r\n\r\nAccording to a popular report, which, true or not, shows the hatred in\r\nwhich the Holy Office was held, the Inquisition was the first building\r\nthat fell down, and probably more than one inquisitor, who, in his life-\r\ntime, had sent scores of Jews or heretics to the stake, was now, in his\r\nturn, burnt alive.\r\n\r\nAs if the unshackled elements were not sufficient agents of destruction,\r\nthe prisons also cast forth their lawless denizens, and a host of\r\nmalefactors, rejoicing in the public calamity which paralysed the arm of\r\njustice, added rapine and murder to the miseries of the city.\r\n\r\nMore than 60,000 persons are supposed to have perished in Lisbon from\r\nall these various causes. The total loss of property was estimated at\r\nfifty millions of dollars, an enormous sum for a small country, and in\r\ntimes when money was far more valuable than at present. A few shocks\r\nsufficed to destroy the treasures accumulated by the savings of many\r\ngenerations.\r\n\r\nThe royal family was at this time residing in the small palace of Belem,\r\nabout a league out of town, and thus escaped being buried among the\r\nruins of the capital—a fortunate occurrence in the midst of so many\r\nmisfortunes; for the anarchy that must have ensued from the destruction\r\nof all authority would have filled the cup of misery to the brim. As it\r\nwas, Government seemed utterly incapable of contending with a disaster\r\nof such colossal proportions. ‘What is to be done?’ said the helpless\r\nking to his minister Carvalho, Marquis of Pombal, who, on entering the\r\ncouncil-chamber, found his sovereign vainly seeking for advice among his\r\nweeping and irresolute courtiers: ‘how can we alleviate the chastisement\r\nwhich Divine justice has imposed upon us?’ ‘Sire! by burying the dead\r\nand taking care of the living,’ was the ready answer of the great\r\nstatesman, whose noble bearing and confident mien at once restored the\r\nking’s courage. From that moment José bestowed a boundless confidence\r\nupon Pombal. Without losing a single moment, the minister, invested with\r\nfull powers, threw himself into a carriage, and hastened with all speed\r\nto the scene of destruction. Wherever his presence was most needed,\r\nthere was he sure to be found. For several days and nights he never left\r\nhis carriage, whence, incessantly active in his efforts to reduce chaos\r\nto order, he issued no less than two hundred decrees, all bearing the\r\nstamp of a master-mind. Troops from the provinces were summoned in all\r\nhaste, and concentrated round the capital, which no one was allowed to\r\nleave without permission, so that the robbers, who had enriched\r\nthemselves with the plunder of palaces and churches, were unable to\r\nescape with their spoils.\r\n\r\nIn all his numerous ordinances Carvalho neglected none of the details\r\nnecessary for insuring their practical utility, writing many of them on\r\nhis knees with a pencil, and sending them, without loss of time, to the\r\nvarious officers charged with their execution. His wise regulations for\r\nensuring a speedy supply and a regular distribution of provisions\r\naverted famine. Great fears were entertained of pestilential disorders,\r\nin consequence of the putrid exhalations of so many corpses, which it\r\nwas impossible to bury. To prevent this additional misfortune, Carvalho\r\ninduced the Patriarch to give orders that the bodies of the dead should\r\nbe cast into the sea, with only such religious ceremonies as\r\ncircumstances permitted.\r\n\r\nBut the Jesuits, the mortal enemies of the enlightened minister, did not\r\nlose this opportunity of intriguing against him, and openly ascribed the\r\ncatastrophe to the wrath of God against an impious Government. Thus\r\nPombal had not only to cope with the disastrous effects of the\r\nearthquake, but also with the venomous attacks of hypocritical bigots,\r\nin spite of whose clamours he interdicted all public processions and\r\ndevotional exercises that were calculated still further to inflame the\r\nexcited minds of the populace.\r\n\r\nThough Lisbon was the chief sufferer from the great earthquake of 1755,\r\nthe shocks which destroyed the capital of Portugal proved disastrous in\r\nmany other places, and vibrated far and wide over a considerable portion\r\nof the globe. St. Ubes was nearly swallowed up by the sudden rising of\r\nthe sea. At Cadiz the shocks were so violent that the water in the\r\ncisterns washed backwards and forwards so as to make a great froth upon\r\nit. No damage was done, on account of the excessive strength of the\r\nbuildings; but, about an hour after, an immense wave, at least 60 feet\r\nhigher than common, was seen approaching from the sea. It broke against\r\nthe west part of the town, which is very rocky, and where, fortunately,\r\nthe cliffs abated a great deal of its force. At last it burst upon the\r\nwalls, destroyed part of the fortifications, and swept away huge pieces\r\nof cannon. The strong causeway which connects the town with the Island\r\nof Leon, was utterly destroyed, and more than fifty people drowned that\r\nwere on it at the time.\r\n\r\nIn Seville a number of houses were thrown down, and the bells were set\r\na-ringing in Malaga. In Italy, Germany, and France, in Holland and in\r\nSweden, in Great Britain and in Ireland, the lakes and rivers were\r\nviolently agitated. The water in Loch Lomond rose suddenly and violently\r\nagainst its banks, so that a large stone lying at some distance from the\r\nshore, in shallow water, was moved from its place, and carried to dry\r\nland, leaving a deep furrow in the ground along which it had moved. At\r\nKinsale, in Ireland, a great body of water suddenly burst into the\r\nharbour, and with such violence that it broke the cables of two vessels,\r\neach moored with two anchors, and of several boats which lay near the\r\ntown. The vessels were whirled round several times by an eddy formed in\r\nthe water, and then hurried back again with the same rapidity as before.\r\nLondon was shaken, the midland counties disturbed, and one high cliff in\r\nYorkshire threw down its half-separated rocks. At Töplitz, in Bohemia,\r\nbetween eleven and twelve o’clock, the mineral waters increased so much\r\nin quantity that all the baths ran over. About half an hour before, the\r\nspring grew turbid and flowed muddy, and, having stopped entirely for\r\nnearly a minute, broke forth again with prodigious violence, driving\r\nbefore it a considerable quantity of reddish ochre. After this, it\r\nbecame clear, and flowed as pure as before, but supplying more water\r\nthan usual, and that hotter and more impregnated with its medicinal\r\nsubstances.\r\n\r\nIn Barbary, the earthquake was felt nearly as severely as in Portugal.\r\nGreat part of the city of Algiers was destroyed; at Fez, Mequinez, and\r\nMorocco many houses were thrown down, and numbers of persons were buried\r\nin the ruins. At Tangiers and Sallee the waters rushed into the streets\r\nwith great violence, and when they retired they left behind them a great\r\nquantity of fish.\r\n\r\nShips sailing on the distant Atlantic received such violent concussions\r\nthat it seemed as if they had struck upon a rock, and even America was\r\ndisturbed.\r\n\r\nAt the Island of Antigua the sea rose to such a height as had never been\r\nknown before, and at Barbadoes a tremendous wave overflowed the wharfs\r\nand rushed into the streets. The remote Canadian lakes were seen to ebb\r\nand flow in an extraordinary manner, and the Red Indian hunter felt the\r\nlast expiring pulsations of the great terrestrial shock which a few\r\nhours before had overthrown the distant capital of Portugal.\r\n\r\nSuch were the extraordinary effects of this terrible earthquake, which\r\nextended over a space of not less than four millions of square miles! Of\r\nthe enormous sensation it produced over all Europe, as well as of the\r\ndeep impression it made upon his own youthful mind, Goethe, then about\r\nsix years old, has given us a masterly account in his autobiography\r\n(‘Dichtung und Wahrheit’).\r\n\r\n‘For the first time,’ says the illustrious poet, ‘the boy’s peace of\r\nmind was disturbed by an extraordinary event. On November 1, 1755, the\r\nearthquake of Lisbon took place, and spread consternation over a world\r\nwhich had long been accustomed to tranquillity and peace. A large and\r\nsplendid capital, the seat of wealth and commerce, suddenly falls a prey\r\nto the most terrible disaster. The earth shakes, the sea rises, ships\r\nare dashed against each other, houses, churches, and towers fall in; the\r\nking’s palace is partly engulfed by the waves; the bursting earth seems\r\nto vomit flames, for smoke and fire appear everywhere among the ruins.\r\nSixty thousand persons, but a moment before in the enjoyment of a\r\ncomfortable existence, are swept away, and they are the most fortunate\r\nwho no longer feel or remember their misery. The flames continue to\r\nrage, along with a host of criminals whom the catastrophe has set at\r\nliberty. The unfortunate survivors are exposed to robbery, to murder, to\r\nevery act of violence; and thus on all sides Nature replaces law by the\r\nreign of unfettered anarchy. Swifter than the news could travel, the\r\neffects of the earthquake had already spread over a wide extent of land;\r\nin many places slighter commotions had been felt; mineral springs had\r\nsuddenly ceased to flow; and all these circumstances increased the\r\ngeneral alarm when the terrible details of the catastrophe became known.\r\nThe pious were now not sparing of moral reflexions, the philosophers of\r\nconsolations, the clergy of admonitions. Thus the attention of the world\r\nwas for some time concentrated upon this single topic, and the public,\r\nexcited by the misfortunes of strangers, began to feel an increasing\r\nanxiety for its personal safety, as from all sides intelligence came\r\npouring in of the widely-extended effects of the earthquake. The demon\r\nof fear has indeed, perhaps, never spread terror so rapidly and so\r\npowerfully over the earth. The boy who heard the subject frequently\r\ndiscussed was not a little perplexed. God, the Creator and Preserver of\r\nHeaven and Earth, whom the first article of faith represented as\r\nsupremely wise and merciful, appeared by no means paternal while thus\r\nenveloping the just and the unjust in indiscriminate ruin. It was in\r\nvain that his youthful mind endeavoured to shake off these impressions,\r\nnor can this be wondered at, as even the wise and the learned did not\r\nagree in their opinions on the subject.’\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XI.\r\n                               LANDSLIPS.\r\n\r\nIgneous and Aqueous Causes of Landslips—Fall of the Diablerets in 1714\r\n  and 1749—Escape of a Peasant from his living Tomb—Vitaliano Donati on\r\n  the Fall of a Mountain near Sallenches—The Destruction of Goldau in\r\n  1806—Wonderful Preservation of a Child—Burial of Velleja and\r\n  Tauretunum, of Plürs and Scilano—Landslip near Axmouth in Dorsetshire—\r\n  Falling in of Cavern-roofs—Dollinas and Jamas in Carniola and\r\n  Dalmatia—Bursting of Bogs—Crateriform Hollows in the Eifel.\r\n\r\n\r\nLandslips, or sudden subsidences and displacements of portions of land,\r\nresult both from igneous and aqueous causes.\r\n\r\nWherever cavities have been formed beneath the surface of the earth,\r\nwhether in consequence of volcanic eruptions or by the erosive and\r\ndissolving action of subterranean waters, the shock of an earthquake or\r\nthe mere weight of the superincumbent mass may cause the roof to fall\r\nin, or the superficial ground, no longer sustained by its undermined\r\nfoundations, to slide away and sink to a lower level.\r\n\r\nIn mountainous regions it frequently occurs that the foundations of a\r\nrock, undermined by filtering waters, give way, and that huge masses of\r\nstone and earth, now no longer reposing on a solid basis, are\r\nprecipitated into the valley below. More than once, the slipping or\r\nfalling in of a mountain has brought death and destruction upon the\r\nhumble dwellings of the Alpine peasants, and added many a mournful page\r\nto their simple annals. Thus, in the years 1714 and 1749, large beds of\r\nstone were detached from the Diablerets, a mountain stock between the\r\ncantons of Vaux and Valais, and burying the meadows of Cheville and\r\nLeytron under a mound of rubbish 300 feet deep, killed many herds and\r\nshepherds.\r\n\r\nIn the first of these catastrophes, the life of a peasant was preserved\r\nin a wonderful manner. An immense block came toppling down close to his\r\nchâlet and covered it like a shield, so as to preserve it from being\r\ncrushed by the following débris, though piled up two hundred feet above\r\nit. Thus, immured as it were in a living tomb, the unfortunate man spent\r\nmiserable weeks and months, subsisting on the stores of cheese hoarded\r\nin his hut, without light and air, and in constant fear that the rocks\r\nabove his head might give way and bury him under their ruins. With all\r\nthe energy of despair, he endeavoured to find his way out of the mighty\r\nmound of rubbish, and at length, after incredible toil, emerged into the\r\nopen daylight. More like a spectre than a human being, pale and\r\nemaciated, with torn clothes, and covered with bruises, he knocked at\r\nthe door of his house[12] in the lower valley, where his wife and\r\nchildren, who had already long reckoned him among the dead, were at\r\nfirst terrified at his ghost-like appearance, and called in the village\r\npastor to convince them of his identity, before they ventured to rejoice\r\nat his return.\r\n\r\nFootnote 12:\r\n\r\n  It is almost superfluous to mention that in the Alps many of the\r\n  peasants lead a migratory existence. During the summer they ascend,\r\n  with their herds, into the higher valleys, where they remain,\r\n  separated from their families, until the first night-frosts force them\r\n  to return to their homes on a lower level.\r\n\r\nOn the road from Sallenches to Servoz, in the Valley of the Arve, well\r\nknown to all the visitors of Mont Blanc, may be seen the ruins of a high\r\nmountain which collapsed in the year 1751, causing so dreadful a crash\r\nand raising such clouds of dust that the whole neighbourhood thought the\r\nworld was at an end. The black dust was taken for smoke; flames had been\r\nseen darting about in the murky clouds, and the report spread to Turin\r\nthat a new Vesuvius had suddenly opened its subterranean furnaces among\r\nthe highest of the Alpine mountains. The king, alarmed or interested at\r\nthe news, immediately sent the famous geologist Vitaliano Donati to\r\ngather accurate information on the spot. Donati, travelling night and\r\nday, with all the eagerness of a zealous naturalist, arrived while the\r\nappalling phenomenon was still in full activity.\r\n\r\n‘The peasants,’ writes Donati to a friend, ‘had all fled from the\r\nneighbourhood, and did not venture to approach the crashing mountain\r\nwithin a distance of two Italian miles. The country around was covered\r\nwith dust, which closely resembled ashes, and had been carried by the\r\nwind to a distance of five miles. I examined the dust, and found it to\r\nconsist of pulverised marble. I also attentively observed the smoke, but\r\ncould see no flames, nor could I perceive a sulphurous smell; the water\r\nalso of the rivulets and sources showed no trace of sulphurous matter.\r\nThis convinced me at once that no volcanic eruption was taking place,\r\nand penetrating into the cloud of dust which enveloped the mountain, I\r\nadvanced close to the scene of the commotion. I there saw enormous rocks\r\ntumbling piecemeal into an abyss with a dreadful noise, louder than the\r\nrolling of thunder or the roar of heavy artillery, and distinctly saw\r\nthat the smoke was nothing but the dust rising from their fall.\r\n\r\n‘Further investigations also showed me the cause of the phenomenon, for\r\nI found the mountain to consist of horizontal strata, the lowest being\r\ncomposed of a loose stone of a slaty texture, while the upper ones,\r\nthough of a more compact nature, were rent with numerous crevices. On\r\nthe back of the mountain were three small lakes, the water of which,\r\npenetrating through the fissures of the strata, had gradually loosened\r\ntheir foundations. The snow, which had fallen during the previous winter\r\nmore abundantly than had ever been known within the memory of man,\r\nhastened the progress of destruction, and caused the fall of six hundred\r\nmillion cubic feet of stone, which alone would have sufficed to form a\r\ngreat mountain. Six shepherds, as many houses, and a great number of\r\ncows and goats have been buried under the ruins.\r\n\r\n‘In my report to the king I have accurately described the causes and\r\neffects of the catastrophe, and foretold its speedy termination—a\r\nprediction which has been fully verified by the event—and thus the new\r\nvolcano has become extinct almost as soon as its formation was\r\nannounced.’\r\n\r\nFortunately, this grand convulsion of nature, which spread consternation\r\nfar and wide, caused the death of but a few victims. The landslip of the\r\nRufi or Rossberg, which, on September 2, 1806, devastated the lovely\r\nVale of Goldau, and overwhelmed four villages, with their rich pasture-\r\ngrounds and gardens, was far more disastrous. The preceding years had\r\nbeen unusually wet, the filtering waters had loosened the Nagelfluh, or\r\ncoarse conglomerate of which the mountain is composed, and the rains\r\nhaving latterly been almost continuous, a great part of the mountain,\r\nundermined by the subterranean action of the waters, at length gave way\r\nand was hurled into the valley below.\r\n\r\nEarly in the morning the shepherds who were tending their herds on the\r\nmountains perceived fresh crevices in the ground and on the rock walls.\r\nIn many parts the turf appeared as if turned up by a ploughshare, and a\r\ncracking noise as if roots were violently snapped asunder was heard in\r\nthe neighbouring forest. From hour to hour, the rents, the cracking, the\r\nrolling down of single stones increased, until finally, at about five in\r\nthe afternoon, a large chasm opened in the flanks of the mountain,\r\ngrowing every instant deeper, longer, and broader. Then from the\r\nopposite Righi the forest might be seen to wave to and fro like a storm-\r\ntossed sea, and the whole flank of the mountain to slide down with a\r\nconstantly increasing velocity, until finally hundreds of millions of\r\ncubic feet of rock came sweeping down into the valley with a noise as if\r\nthe foundations of the earth were giving way. The friction or clash of\r\nthe huge stones, hurled against each other in their fall, produced so\r\nintense a heat that flames were seen to flash forth from the avalanche,\r\nand the moisture with which they were saturated, being suddenly changed\r\ninto steam, caused explosions like those from the crater of a volcano.\r\nDense clouds of dust veiled the scene of destruction, and it was not\r\nbefore they slowly rolled away that the whole extent of the disaster\r\nbecame visible. Where, but a few hours since, four prosperous villages—\r\nGoldau, Busingen, Upper and Lower Röthen, and Lowerz—had been gilded by\r\nthe sun, and numerous herds had been grazing on the rich pastures along\r\nthe borders of the lake of Lowerz, nothing was now to be seen but a\r\ndesolate chaos of rocks, beneath which 457 persons lay buried. From this\r\nterrible disaster some wonderful escapes are recorded. High on the slope\r\nof the Rossberg, lived Bläsi Mettler, with his young wife Agatha. When,\r\nin the morning, the first premonitory signs of the disaster appeared,\r\nand the labouring mountain began to raise its warning voice, the\r\nsuperstitious peasant, fancying he heard the jubilee of demons, hastened\r\ndown to Arth, on the bank of the lake of Zug, and begged the parish\r\npriest, with tears and lamentations, to accompany him, and exorcise the\r\nevil spirits with a copious sprinkling of holy water. While he was still\r\nspeaking, the catastrophe took place, and he now rushed back again to\r\nhis hut, where beyond all doubt his beloved wife and his only child,\r\nwhich was but four weeks old, had found a premature grave.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Agatha had spent several anxious hours. She was preparing her\r\nhumble evening meal when the thundering uproar and the shaking of the\r\nhut filled her with the terrors of death. Seizing the infant, which lay\r\nawake in its cradle, she crossed the threshold, while the soil under her\r\nfeet slid down into the valley. Escaping into the open air, she looked\r\nback and saw her hut and a sea of huge stone blocks roll down into the\r\nvale below, while the spot on which she stood remained unmoved. In this\r\nsituation she was found by Bläsi, who, though a poor and ruined man,\r\nstill thanked God for the wonderful preservation of his family.\r\n\r\nAbout a thousand feet lower down the mountain lived Bläsi’s brother\r\nBastian, who, when the mountain slipped, was tending his herd on the\r\nopposite Righi. But his wife and her two little children were in his hut\r\nwhen it was buried beneath the stony avalanche. After the terrible\r\ncommotion had subsided, the relations of Frau Mettler, anxious to\r\nascertain her fate, hastened to the scene of desolation. The hut had\r\ndisappeared, the green Alpine meadow was covered with a heap of ruins,\r\nbut, not far from the former site of the humble cottage, the youngest\r\nchild lay quietly sleeping. At the peril of his life, one of the\r\ninfant’s relations clambered over the ruins and rescued the little\r\nsleeper, who, unhurt amidst the falling rafters of the hut and the ruins\r\nof the crumbling mountain, had been carried away with the bed on which\r\nhe was reposing. On my last visit to Switzerland, I was informed that\r\nSebastian Meinhardt Mettler, the child thus wonderfully saved, died in\r\nthe year 1867, at the age of sixty-one.\r\n\r\nSome of the victims who had been buried in the ruins of the villages\r\nwere dug out and restored to daylight; others, less fortunate, may have\r\nslowly perished, immured in a living grave; but by far the greater\r\nnumber were no doubt suddenly killed. The total number of those who were\r\nsaved, either by the assistance of their friends, or by a timely flight,\r\nor by absence from their homes at the time of the disaster, amounted to\r\n220; but more than double that number perished, and probably there was\r\nnot one among the survivors who had not to lament the loss of friends\r\nand kinsfolk.\r\n\r\nThis dreadful catastrophe also levied its tribute among the strangers\r\nwhom the beauties of Alpine scenery annually attract to Switzerland. A\r\nparty of tourists had left Arth in the afternoon with the intention of\r\nspending the night in Schwyz. Part of the company had already entered\r\nthe ill-fated village of Goldau, and the others were about to follow,\r\nwhen suddenly the thundering roar of the sliding mountain caused them to\r\nstop. Looking up and seeing rocks, forests, huts, all rushing down in\r\nhorrible confusion, they instinctively ran back for their lives. The\r\nwarning came not one instant too soon, for close behind the spot where\r\nthey stopped panting for breath, the stones still fell like hail. But\r\ntheir unfortunate companions, the wife and daughter of Baron Diesbach,\r\nColonel Victor von Steiger, and some boys, whose tutor had been slowly\r\nfollowing them with the Baron, were buried beneath the ruins.\r\n\r\nFrom the Righi the traveller still looks down upon the avalanche of\r\nstones, and the flank of the Rossberg still plainly shows the spot\r\nwhere, more than half a century ago, the masses of rock now reposing in\r\nthe valley detached themselves from the mountain. But the beautifying\r\nhand of vegetation has already done much to adorn the scene of ruin.\r\nGreen mosses have woven their soft carpet over the naked stones, while\r\ngrasses and flowers, and in some places even shrubs and trees, have\r\nsprung up between them. The tears also which once were shed over the\r\nvictims of the great catastrophe have long since been dried, and its\r\nlast witnesses have passed away to make room for a new generation, who\r\nremember the mountain-slip which buried their fathers only as a legend\r\nof the past.\r\n\r\nThis terrible disaster, however appalling through the far-spread\r\ndesolation it entailed, has yet been equalled or surpassed by others of\r\na like nature. In the fifth century, the old Roman town of Velleja was\r\nburied under the ruins of the Ravinazzo Mountain, and the bones and\r\ncoins dug out of its ancient site prove that no time was left to the\r\ninhabitants for flight. Tauretunum was once a flourishing Roman town,\r\nsituated on the south bank of the lake of Geneva, at the foot of the\r\nDent d’Oche. In 563 it was utterly destroyed by a disruption of the\r\noverhanging mountain. The avalanche of stones which at that time was\r\nhurled down upon the devoted city is still visible as a promontory\r\nprojecting far into the lake, which is here at least 500 feet deep. The\r\nimmense wave caused by the rocky mass as it plunged into the water\r\ninundated the opposite shore from Morges to Vevay, and swept away every\r\nhomestead that lay on its path.\r\n\r\nIn the night of September 4, 1618, the falling of the Monte Conto, in\r\nthe Vale of Chiavenna, so completely buried the small town of Plürs and\r\nthe village of Scilano, that of their 2,430 inhabitants but three\r\nremained alive, and but one single house escaped the universal\r\ndestruction. At present, magnificent chestnut-trees grow upon the mound\r\nof ruins and cast their shade over the graves of the long-forgotten\r\nvictims. Three villages, with their whole population, were covered in\r\nthe district of Treviso when the Piz mountain fell in 1772; and the\r\nenormous masses of rock which in 1248 detached themselves from Mount\r\nGrenier, south of Chambery in Savoy, buried five parishes, including the\r\ntown and church of Saint André, the ruin occupying an extent of about\r\nnine square miles.\r\n\r\nSometimes the same village has been repeatedly destroyed by mountain-\r\nslips. Thus excavations have shown that Brienz, a hamlet built on the\r\nborders of the lake of the same name, on a mound of accumulated ruins,\r\nhas been twice overwhelmed by a deluge of stones and mud, and twice\r\nreconstructed.\r\n\r\nIt would be useless to multiply examples of the undermining power of\r\nwater. I will merely add that it is impossible to wander through the\r\nvalleys of Switzerland without being struck by the sight of the sloping\r\nhillocks of rubbish piled up against the foot of every gigantic rock\r\nwall, which in many cases can only be attributed to that cause. Some are\r\nentirely overgrown with large firs, thus showing that the last stony\r\navalanche took place at a remote period; others are desolate heaps of\r\nrubbish, which evidently prove that the work of destruction is\r\nconstantly going on, and that the highest peaks will ultimately be\r\nlevelled with the plain. Over many a hamlet the sword of Damocles is\r\ncontinually suspended in the shape of a precipitous rock-wall, or of a\r\nforest-crowned mountain-brow. For years the undermining waters are\r\nslowly and secretly at work, and then suddenly the crisis takes place.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AXMOUTH LANDSLIP.]\r\n\r\nWere the history of the Andes or of the Himalayas as familiar to us as\r\nthat of the Alps, we should be able to relate many like instances of\r\ndisastrous mountain-slips. But the high places of the earth do not alone\r\nbear witness to the power of aqueous erosion, for wherever the soil is\r\nundermined, it may be precipitated to a lower level. Thus, the\r\nphenomenon is by no means uncommon in England, though rarely occurring\r\non so large a scale as in the landslip which took place at Axmouth in\r\nDorsetshire, on December 24, 1839.\r\n\r\n‘The tract of downs ranging there along the coast,’ says Sir Charles\r\nLyell (‘Principles of Geology’), ‘is capped by chalk, which rests on\r\nsandstone, beneath which is more than 100 feet of loose sand, the whole\r\nof these masses reposing on retentive beds of clay shelving towards the\r\nsea. Numerous springs, issuing from the loose sand, have gradually\r\nremoved portions of it, and thus undermined the superstratum. In 1839,\r\nan excessively wet season had saturated all the rocks with moisture, so\r\nas to increase the weight of the incumbent mass, from which the support\r\nhad already been withdrawn by the action of springs. Thus, the\r\nsuperstrata were precipitated into hollows prepared for them, and the\r\nadjacent masses of partially undermined rock to which the motion was\r\ncommunicated, were made to slide down, on a slippery basis of watery\r\nsand, towards the sea. These causes gave rise to a convulsion, which\r\nbegan on the morning of December 24, with a crashing noise; and, on the\r\nevening of the same day, fissures were seen opening in the ground, and\r\nthe walls of tenements rending and sinking, until a deep chasm or ravine\r\nwas formed, extending nearly three-quarters of a mile in length, with a\r\ndepth of from 100 to 150 feet, and a breadth exceeding 240 feet. At the\r\nbottom of this deep gulf lie fragments of the original surface, thrown\r\ntogether in the wildest confusion. In consequence of lateral movements,\r\nthe tract intervening between the new fissure and the sea, including the\r\nancient undercliff, was fractured, and the whole line of sea-cliff\r\ncarried bodily forwards for many yards. This motion of the sea-cliff\r\nproduced a further effect, which may rank among the most striking\r\nphenomena of this catastrophe. The lateral pressure of the descending\r\nrocks urged the neighbouring strata, extending beneath the shingle of\r\nthe shore, by their state of unnatural condensation, to burst upwards in\r\na line parallel to the coast, so that an elevated ridge, more than a\r\nmile in length and rising more than forty feet, covered by a confused\r\nassemblage of broken strata and immense blocks of rock, invested with\r\nseaweed and corallines, and scattered over with shells and starfish, and\r\nother productions of the deep, forms an extended reef in front of the\r\npresent range of cliffs.’\r\n\r\nLandslips caused by the falling in of cavern roofs are nowhere more\r\ncommon than in the cretaceous strata, which are more liable than others\r\nto be undermined by the action of running waters. In the vast chalk-\r\nrange extending from Carinthia to the Morea, they occur of all sizes,\r\nfrom a diameter of a few fathoms to one of many thousand feet, and are\r\nnot seldom of considerable depth. They are generally funnel-shaped,\r\nsometimes elongated; and the bottom of the larger ones is generally\r\ncovered with villages, orchards, vineyards, or considerable tracts of\r\narable land. In Dalmatia, Carinthia, Carniola, and Istria, where the\r\ncountry consists chiefly of arid plateaux or mountain-chains, exposed to\r\nthe dry north-easterly winds, the cultivation of the soil is almost\r\nexclusively confined to these depressions or _dollinas_, which, as a\r\nfurther protection against the cutting blasts, are inclosed with walls\r\nof loose stones.\r\n\r\nBesides the funnel-shaped landslips or _dollinas_, there are others with\r\nperpendicular sides like walls or shafts, which are called _jamas_ or\r\nmouths. One of these (near Breschiak) descends to a depth of 384 feet.\r\nThe hares seek a winter refuge in the _dollinas_, and the _jamas_, as\r\nthe favourite resort of pigeons, are also called pigeon-holes or\r\n_golubinas_. Many a pedestrian has lost his life by falling into a\r\n_jama_, particularly in former times, when fewer precautions were taken\r\nto protect the stranger against these treacherous precipices.\r\n\r\nIn the Jura Mountains there are also whole rows of cauldron-shaped\r\ndepressions; and in North Jutland, where the chalk formation is likewise\r\nvery extensive, a recent landslip suddenly emptied the Norr Lake, which\r\nlost itself in subterranean channels.\r\n\r\nEffects very similar to those of an ordinary landslip are sometimes\r\nproduced by the bursting of a bog. On the western confines of England\r\nand Scotland, the Solway Moss occupies a flat area about seven miles in\r\ncircumference. Its surface is covered with grass and rushes, presenting\r\na dry crust and a fair appearance; but it shakes under the least\r\npressure, the bottom being unsound and semi-fluid. The adventurous\r\npassenger therefore, who sometimes, in dry seasons, traverses this\r\ntreacherous waste, must pick his way over the rushy tussocks as they\r\nappear before him, for here the soil is firmest. If his foot slip, or if\r\nhe venture to move in any other part, it is possible he may sink never\r\nto rise again.\r\n\r\nOn December 16, 1772, this quagmire, having been filled, like a great\r\nsponge, with water, during heavy rains, swelled to an unusual height\r\nabove the surrounding country, and then burst. The turfy covering seemed\r\nfor a time to act like the skin of a bladder retaining the fluid within,\r\ntill it forced a passage for itself, when a stream of black half-\r\nconsolidated mud began at first to creep over the plain, resembling in\r\nthe slow rate of its progress an ordinary lava-current. No lives were\r\nlost, but the deluge totally overwhelmed some cottages, and covered 400\r\nacres with a mass of mud and vegetable matter, which in the lowest parts\r\nof the submerged area was at least fifteen feet deep.\r\n\r\nIt may easily be imagined that in Ireland, the classic land of bogs,\r\nsuch phenomena are not uncommon. In the peat of Donegal an ancient log-\r\ncabin was found, in 1833, at the depth of fourteen feet. The cabin was\r\nfilled with peat, and was surrounded by other huts, which were not\r\nexamined. Trunks and roots of trees, preserved in their natural\r\nposition, lay around these huts. There can be little doubt that we have\r\nhere one instance out of many in which villages have been overwhelmed by\r\nthe bursting of a moss.\r\n\r\nIn many volcanic regions we find circular cauldron-shaped depressions in\r\nthe earth’s surface, which might easily be mistaken for land-slips, but\r\nwhich have in reality been formed by explosive discharges of confined\r\nvapours. When vents or fissures are produced by a paroxysm of volcanic\r\nenergy, we can easily understand how in some cases the pent-up gases,\r\nfinding a sudden outlet through some weaker part of the surface, must\r\nact like a powder mine, and scattering the rocks that surrounded the\r\norifice, leave a deep hollow behind as a memento of their fury. The\r\ndepressions thus caused bear a great resemblance to real craters, from\r\nwhich they are, however, distinguished by the absence of a cone of\r\nscoriæ and from their never having ejected lava.\r\n\r\nThese curious crateriform hollows are very common in the Eifel, a\r\nvolcanic region in Rhenish Prussia, where, probably owing to the clayey\r\nnature of the soil, they have become reservoirs of water, or Maare, as\r\nthey are called by the natives. Most of them still have small lakes at\r\ntheir bottom, while others have been drained for the sake of\r\ncultivation, or by the spontaneous rupture or erosion of their banks.\r\nSome of them are of considerable dimensions, such as that of Meerfeld,\r\nthe diameter of which falls very little short of a mile; or the\r\nPulvermaar of Gillenfeld, remarkable for the extreme regularity of its\r\nmagnificent oval basin.\r\n\r\nSimilar lakes or Maare occur in Auvergne, in Java, in the Canary\r\nIslands, in New Zealand, and in the volcanic districts of Italy. The\r\nbeautiful lakes of Albano and Nemi, which have been so often sung by\r\nancient and modern poets, belong to this class; but Fr. Hoffmann, a\r\ncelebrated German geologist, ascribes the origin of the former to a\r\nlandslip caused by the falling in of the roof of a vast subterranean\r\ncavern.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STALACTITE CAVERN AT AGGTELEK, HUNGARY: THE CAVE OF\r\nBORODLA.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XII.\r\n                          ON CAVES IN GENERAL.\r\n\r\nTheir various Forms—Natural Tunnels—The Ventanillas of Gualgayoc—Eimeo—\r\n  Torgatten—Hole in the Mürtschenstock—The Trebich Cave—Grotto of\r\n  Antiparos—Vast Dimensions of the Cave of Adelsberg and of the Mammoth\r\n  Cave—Discovery of Baumann’s Cave—Limestone Caves—Causes of their\r\n  Excavation—Stalactites and Stalagmites—Their Origin—Variety of Forms—\r\n  Marine Caves—Shetland—Fingal’s Cave—The Azure Cave—Cave under\r\n  Bonifacio—Grotta di Nettuno, near Syracuse—The Bufador of Papa Luna—\r\n  Volcanic Caves—The Fossa della Palomba—Caves of San Miguel—The\r\n  Surtshellir.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe natural excavations which abound in many mountain chains, or on\r\nrocky shores washed by the stormy sea, are extremely various in their\r\nforms. Many are mere rents or crevices in the disruptured rocks; others\r\nwide vaults, not seldom of hall or dome-like dimensions, or long and\r\nnarrow passages branching out in numerous ramifications. Not seldom the\r\nsame cave alternately expands into spacious chambers, and then again\r\ncontracts into narrow tunnels or galleries. The walls of many are smooth\r\nand nearly parallel; the sides of others are irregular and rugged. Many\r\nhave narrow entrances and swell at greater depths into majestic\r\nproportions; while others open with wide portals, and gradually diminish\r\nin size as they penetrate into the rock. Sometimes an excavation pierces\r\na mountain from side to side like a natural tunnel, so as to allow a\r\npassage to the light of day. Such, among others, are the numerous\r\nperforations or _windows_ (ventanillas) in the serrated bastions of the\r\nrich silver mountain Gualgayoc in the Peruvian Andes, or the opening\r\nthrough one of the high peaks of the romantic island of Eimeo which\r\nrises within sight of Tahiti out of the dark blue ocean. According to a\r\npopular tradition, this hole owes its origin to Oro, the powerful god of\r\nwar, who, having one day quarrelled with the minor god of Eimeo, hurled\r\nhis mighty spear at him over the sea. As even gods, when losing their\r\ntemper, are apt to miss their aim, the puny delinquent escaped unhurt,\r\nwhile the dreadful lance flew like a thunderbolt through the mountain,\r\nleaving the perforation as a lasting memorial of its passage. In Europe\r\nwe likewise meet with several remarkable instances of such natural\r\ntunnels. One of the most celebrated is the grotto of Torgatten in\r\nNorway, which perforates a huge rock, 400 feet above the level of the\r\nsea. Its proportions are truly colossal, as it is no less than 900 feet\r\nlong by from 80 to 100 feet broad; and the arches of its vast portals\r\nmeasure respectively 200 and 120 feet. Its floor is nearly horizontal,\r\nand covered with fine sand; its sides are smooth, as if they had been\r\nchiselled by the hand of man. The sea, with its numberless cliffs and\r\nwhite-crested breakers, appears through the immense gallery as through\r\nthe tube of a gigantic telescope, and in fine sunny weather affords a\r\nspectacle of incomparable beauty.\r\n\r\nWhoever has visited the romantic lake of Wallenstädt, in Switzerland,\r\nwill have had his attention directed to a tunnel near the summit of the\r\nalmost inaccessible Mürtschenstock, a favourite resort of the chamois.\r\nIt is visible from the lake near the hamlet of Mühlehorn, and, though of\r\nconsiderable dimensions, appears to the eye like a mere speck of snow on\r\nthe huge grey rockwall, which towers to a height of 7,517 feet. From the\r\n1st to the 3rd of February, at 2 o’clock in the afternoon, the\r\ninhabitants of Mühlehorn see through this aperture the disk of the sun\r\nfor the first time after a long winter.\r\n\r\nIn the structure of some caves a vertical direction predominates; as,\r\nfor instance, in the Trebich Cave, three leagues from Trieste, which\r\nconsists of several perpendicular shafts, connected by narrow\r\ntransversal passages, and descending one after another, until finally,\r\nat a depth of more than a thousand feet, the cavern terminates in a wide\r\nvaulted space spanning a subterranean river. Such, also, is the renowned\r\nGrotto of Antiparos, into which the visitor is let down by a rope to a\r\ndepth of about twenty fathoms. After reaching a tolerably even platform,\r\nhe is obliged to descend another precipice, and then to proceed over\r\nslippery rocks until he finally reaches the terminal vault.\r\n\r\nIn most caverns, however, the chief direction is horizontal, either on\r\nseveral planes, separated from each other by more or less steep\r\npassages, or on a single level. The dimensions of caves are as various\r\nas their forms. Many are small and of inconsiderable depth—mere holes\r\nworn in the rock; while others are of a truly astonishing size, and\r\nfatigue the wondering spectator as he wanders through their lofty halls\r\nor endless galleries. The famous Cave of Adelsberg in Carniola has been\r\nexplored to a distance of 1,243 fathoms from the chief entrance; and in\r\nthe Mammoth Cave in Kentucky no less than 226 avenues branch out to the\r\nright and left from the main gallery, so as to form a network of\r\nsubterranean passages and halls of various dimensions, whose total\r\nlength has been computed at about 160 miles!\r\n\r\nAs many caves are without any visible communication with the external\r\nworld, and the entrance of others is frequently narrow, and concealed\r\nbehind rocks in solitary ravines on wild hill slopes or steep sea\r\nshores, far from the busy haunts of man, we cannot wonder that chance\r\nhas frequently been instrumental in their discovery. Sometimes a hunter\r\npursuing a wild animal has been led to the hidden cave in which it\r\nsought a refuge, or the workmen in a quarry have been suddenly surprised\r\nat meeting with a hollow in the rock, which opened an unexpected passage\r\ninto the bowels of the mountain. The digging of wells, of cellars, of\r\nfoundations, the boring for mines or Artesian wells, has often revealed\r\nthe existence of unknown subterranean chambers; and so recently as 1868,\r\none of the finest known caverns, which already attracts a number of\r\ndelighted visitors, was discovered in the neighbourhood of the thriving\r\nmanufacturing town of Iserlohn in Westphalia, on blasting a rock for the\r\nmaking of a railway. We may thus infer that a vast number of caves must\r\nstill be totally unknown; many so situated that chance may one day lead\r\nto their discovery; while others are hollowed out at such vast depths in\r\nthe earth-rind as to be for ever inaccessible to man.\r\n\r\nEven of those caves which have been objects of curiosity for centuries,\r\nmany have still been by no means thoroughly explored. In the year 1848\r\nan American gentleman persuaded the guides of Baumann’s Cave in the Harz\r\nMountains to accompany him on a voyage of discovery through parts of the\r\ncavern hitherto untrodden by man. It was no easy task to clamber over\r\nslippery rocks and deep chasms yawning into black abysses; but curiosity\r\nand the spirit of adventure kept leading them on from passage to passage\r\nand vault to vault, when suddenly the lights began to burn more dimly;\r\nand the glass of the guiding compass having been accidentally broken\r\nwarned them to retrace their steps. They had been wandering for twenty-\r\nfour hours in the subterranean labyrinth, and after so long an absence\r\nfrom the light of day, joyfully hailed the green hill slope which decks\r\nthat mysterious palace of the gnomes. Franz Baumann, the first\r\ndiscoverer of the cavern, was less fortunate. Its tortuous windings\r\nconfused the expert and intrepid miner, who lost his way in the recesses\r\nof the cave. While seeking in vain for an outlet, his sparing light went\r\nout. Three days he groped about in darkness, until at length, worn out\r\nand exhausted, he was led by a wonderful chance to the mouth of the\r\ncave. Before he died he had yet sufficient strength briefly to mention\r\nthe wonders he had seen during his fatal expedition. His descendants\r\nstill enjoy the privilege of serving as guides to the visitors of the\r\ncave, and never fail to relate the melancholy end of their ill-fated\r\nforefather.\r\n\r\nGrottoes and caves occur in every kind of rock, in lavas, basalt, slate,\r\nand granite, as well as in limestone, dolomite, and gypsum; for the\r\nvolcanic powers are capable of rending the hardest stone, and the\r\nfoaming breakers of a turbulent ocean meet with no cliff that is able\r\nultimately to resist their never-tiring assaults.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ENTRANCE TO THE CAVE OF ADELSBERG.]\r\n\r\nBut, owing to their great fragility and to the solubility of limestone\r\n(carbonate of lime) in water containing carbonic acid, calcareous rocks\r\nare more liable than any others to be shattered and undermined, both by\r\nvolcanic and aqueous causes. Its water readily absorbs carbonic acid\r\ngas. Every drop of rain that falls upon the ground necessarily contains\r\nsome small portion of this gas, which, as we all know, is constantly\r\nmixed with the atmosphere, and thus becomes a solvent for chalk; more\r\nparticularly if the latter, as, for instance, in the Karst Mountains of\r\nCarniola, contains some proto-carbonate of iron, which, changing into an\r\noxide when in contact with water, yields its carbonic acid to the\r\npercolating fluid, and consequently increases its solvent powers. Hence\r\nevery shower of rain that filters through the crevices of a limestone\r\nrock wears away some part of its mass; and if we consider the vast\r\nnumber of years over which these operations have extended, and add to\r\ntheir effects the transporting powers of the waters on their progress\r\nthrough the subterranean channels which they have excavated or enlarged,\r\nwe can easily comprehend how in the course of ages whole mountains may\r\nbe hollowed out.\r\n\r\nAs the streams that flow on the surface of the earth are constantly\r\naltering their courses, thus also the subterranean waters are ever\r\nactive in excavating new channels in the bosom of the rock. Finding at\r\nlength new outlets on a lower level, they abandon their ancient beds,\r\nand the explorer now wanders dry-footed where once a foaming river\r\ngushed along. The Cave of Adelsberg is a remarkable example of the\r\nchanges which the subterranean waters, aided by time or by the\r\ndisrupting power of earthquakes, may thus bring about; for the Poik now\r\nflows beneath its galleries in the same north-easterly direction, in a\r\nchannel which is for the greatest part unknown and inexplorable, so that\r\nthe dry cave of the present day must evidently have been the old river-\r\nbed. But nowhere can be found such perfect, unequivocal, and abundant\r\nproofs of the action of running water in corroding and excavating new\r\npassages in a soluble rock as in the huge Mammoth Cave. The rough-hewn\r\nblock in the quarry does not bear more distinct proof of the hammer and\r\nthe chisel of the workman than these interminable galleries afford of\r\nits denuding and dissolving power. At Niagara we see a vast chasm\r\nevidently cut by water for seven miles, and still in progress; but we\r\ncannot see beneath the cataract the water-worn surface, nor the rounded\r\nangles of the precipice; while the frosts and rains of countless winters\r\nhave reduced the walls of the chasm itself to a talus of crumbling and\r\nmoss-grown rocks. But in the Mammoth Cave we see a freshness and\r\nperfection of surface such as can be found only where the destructive\r\nagencies of meteoric causes are wholly absent. Here we have the dry beds\r\nof subterranean rivers exactly as they were left thousands of years ago\r\nby the streams which flowed through them when Niagara was young. No\r\nangle is less sharp, no groove or excavation less perfect, than it was\r\noriginally left when the waters were suddenly drained off by cutting\r\ntheir way to some lower level. The very sand and rounded pebbles, which\r\nnow pave the galleries and which anciently formed the bed of the stream,\r\nhave remained in many of the more distant galleries untrodden even by\r\nthe foot of man. ‘The rush of ideas was strange and overpowering,’ says\r\nProfessor Silliman, ‘as I stood in one of these before unvisited\r\navenues, in which the glow of a lamp had never before shone, and\r\nconsidered the complex chain of phenomena which were before me. There\r\nwere the delicate silicious forms of cyathophylli and encrinites\r\nprotruding from the softer limestone, which had yielded to the\r\ndissolving power of the water; these carried me back to that vast and\r\ndesolate ocean in which they flourished, and were entombed as the\r\ncrystalline matrix was slowly cast around them, mute chroniclers of a\r\ndistant epoch. Then succeeded the long periods of the upper secondary,\r\nand, these past, the slow but resistless force of the contracting sphere\r\nelevated and drained the rocky beds of the ancient ocean. The action of\r\nthe meteorological causes commenced, and the dissolving power of fresh\r\nwater, following the almost invisible lines of structure in the rocks,\r\nbegan to hollow out these winding paths slowly and yet surely.’ What a\r\nlesson for the thoughtful spectator, and how vast a prospect into the\r\ndark abysses of the past here unrolls itself before him!\r\n\r\nAfter abandoning the vaults where they once collected and formed a\r\nrunning stream, the waters, filtering through the porous limestone,\r\nbegin to ornament them with lustrous petrifactions; for whether below or\r\nabove the surface of the earth, Nature ever loves to decorate her works.\r\nThe moisture, charged with carbonate of lime, evaporates or parts with\r\nits free carbonic acid in coming into contact with the air of the cave;\r\nthe carbonate, now no longer held in solution, precipitates and forms\r\ncalcareous incrustations or excrescences, which in course of time assume\r\nevery variety of fantastic shape, either hanging like icicles from the\r\nvault (stalactites), or rising in columns (stalagmites) from the floor\r\nof the cave where the dripping water deposited its spar. Sometimes\r\nstalactites and stalagmites join as they continue to grow in opposite\r\ndirections, and ultimately form pillars which appear to sustain the\r\nroof.\r\n\r\nOn considering the simple physical and chemical agencies which are at\r\nwork in the formation of these beautiful productions—solution,\r\nmechanical dripping, evaporation, and precipitation—a great similarity\r\nmight naturally be expected in their forms; but here also Nature shows\r\nherself as a consummate artist, and with the simplest means brings forth\r\nan astonishing variety of effects. As among the leaves of a forest there\r\nare not two perfectly alike, thus also every stalactite differs from\r\nanother; and the celebrated traveller Kohl affirms that every\r\nstalactital cave has its peculiar style or character of decoration. The\r\ncauses to which stalactites owe their existence are indeed everywhere\r\nthe same, but the circumstances under which the drops fall and evaporate\r\nare so various that in each case some new shape is produced. Thus all\r\nthe infinite diversity of forms which we admire in the corals and\r\nsponges of the seas, is wonderfully repeated in the dark vaults of the\r\nsubterranean world.\r\n\r\nThe variety and beauty of their colouring likewise contribute to adorn\r\nthese formations. They are generally white, sometimes rivalling the\r\npurity of snow, and translucent, even when of considerable thickness,\r\nbut often also green, brown, yellow, red, orange—a variety of tints\r\nwhich produces the most pleasing effects, and is chiefly owing to the\r\nmetallic salts with which the water has been impregnated while filtering\r\nthrough the calcareous rock.\r\n\r\nAll these wonderful plays of Nature, in which form and colour contribute\r\nto delight the eye or to charm the fancy of the spectator, are, however,\r\nstill less interesting than the reflections suggested by the slow growth\r\nof stalactites in general, and the enormous size which some of them\r\nattain.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STALACTITAL CAVERN IN AUSTRALIA.]\r\n\r\nInscriptions seventy or eighty years old appear covered only with a thin\r\ntranslucent coat of sinter, and in the Cave of Adelsberg names scratched\r\nin the walls more than six centuries ago are still perfectly legible.\r\nHow many ages must, then, have passed before such colossal stalagmites\r\ncould have been formed as, for instance, in the Australian cavern\r\nexplored by Mr. Woods,[13] or in the Cave of Corneale, near Trieste,\r\nwhere we find one of these formations measuring fifty feet in\r\ncircumference, and another rising thirty-five feet above the ground,\r\nwith a trunk as massive as that of an old oak. The ruins of Thebes, or\r\nthe rock-temples of Ipsamboul, appear almost as works of the present day\r\nwhen compared with those amazing monuments of time. But, while\r\nmeditating on their colossal dimensions, the mind is necessarily carried\r\nstill further back, and wanders through the countless ages which the\r\nfiltering waters, collecting into subterranean streams, required for\r\nhollowing out the vast cavities on whose floor those gigantic\r\nstalagmites were subsequently deposited. An epoch of still older date\r\npresents itself when the limestone rocks, now pierced with vast\r\nstalactital caverns, were first slowly forming at the bottom of the\r\nprimeval sea by the accumulation of countless exuviæ of zoophytes, star-\r\nfishes, and foraminifera, and after growing into strata many hundred\r\nfeet thick, were then forced upwards by plutonic powers, and became\r\nportions of the dry land. Nor is this the end of the vast perspective,\r\nfor changes still more remote loom in the fathomless distance. The mind\r\ngrows giddy while thus plunging into the abyss of time, and, in spite of\r\nthe ideas of sublimity awakened by such meditations, feels a painful\r\nsense of its incapacity to conceive a plan of such infinite extent.\r\n\r\nFootnote 13:\r\n\r\n  ‘The Geology of South Australia.’\r\n\r\nWhile on land the running or filtering waters restlessly pursue their\r\nwork of excavation, the tumultuous waves of the ocean impress on every\r\nrocky shore the seal of their tremendous power. As, day after day, and\r\nyear after year, the billows strike against the cliffs that oppose their\r\nprogress, they undermine their foundations, scoop out wide portals in\r\ntheir projecting headlands, and hollow out deep caverns. Here also water\r\nappears as the beautifying element, decorating inanimate nature with\r\npicturesque forms; and the sea nowhere exhibits more romantic scenes\r\nthan on the bold coasts against which her waves have been beating for\r\nmany a millennium. During the calm ebb tide seals are often seen sunning\r\nthemselves at the entrance of the oceanic grottoes, while cormorants\r\nstand before them as guardians of the dark galleries beyond; the waves\r\nmurmur in softer strains, and the screeching sea-mew glides with his\r\nsilvery pinions through the tranquil air; but when the stormy flood\r\nbatters against the coast, the billows rush into the caverns, scaring\r\nall animal life away, and no voice is heard but that of the ocean.\r\n\r\nOur coasts abound in beauties such as these, particularly on the wild\r\nshores of Shetland or the stormy Hebrides—\r\n\r\n           ‘Where rise no groves and where no gardens blow,\r\n           Where even the hardy heath scarce dares to grow;\r\n           But rocks on rocks, in mist and storm arrayed,\r\n           Stretch far to sea their giant colonnade.’—SCOTT.\r\n\r\nAlong the coast of the mainland of Shetland and the neighbouring islets\r\nof Bressay and Noss, cape follows upon cape, consisting of bold cliffs\r\nhollowed into caverns, or divided into pillars and arches of fantastic\r\nappearance, by the constant action of the waves. As the voyager passes\r\nthe most northerly of these headlands, and turns into the open sea, the\r\nscenes become yet more sublime. Rocks, upwards of three or four hundred\r\nfeet in height, present themselves in colossal succession, sinking\r\nperpendicularly into the sea, which is very deep, even within a few\r\nfathoms of their base. All these huge precipices abound with caves, many\r\nof which run much farther into the rock than the boldest islander has\r\never ventured to penetrate. One of these marine excavations, called ‘The\r\nOrkneyman’s Harbour,’ is remarkable for the circumstance of an Orkney\r\nvessel having once run in there to escape a French privateer. Sir Walter\r\nScott, who visited this interesting spot, found the entrance lofty\r\nenough to admit his six-oared boat without striking the mast, but a\r\nsudden turn in the direction of the cave would have consigned him to\r\nutter darkness if he had gone in further. The dropping of the sea fowl\r\nand cormorants into the water from the sides of the cavern, when\r\ndisturbed by his approach, had something in it wild and terrible.\r\n\r\nThe shores of Caithness and of Sutherland, and of many of the islets in\r\nthe Highland seas, likewise exhibit many wonderful specimens of the\r\nfantastic architecture of the ocean; but pre-eminent above all in\r\ngrandeur and renown is Fingal’s Cave.\r\n\r\nSir Walter Scott, who twice visited this celebrated grotto (in 1810 and\r\n1814), pronounced it above all description sublime. ‘The stupendous\r\ncolumns and side-walls, the depth and strength of the ocean with which\r\nthe cavern is filled, the variety of tints formed by stalactites\r\ndropping and petrifying between the pillars, and resembling a sort of\r\nchasing of yellow or cream-coloured marble, filling the interstices of\r\nthe roof—the corresponding variety below, where the ocean rolls over a\r\nred, and in some places a violet-coloured rock, the basis of the\r\nbasaltic pillars—the dreadful noise of those august billows, so well\r\ncorresponding with the grandeur of the scene—are all circumstances\r\nelsewhere unparalleled.’\r\n\r\nIn the Azure Cave of Capri, the Mediterranean possesses a marine grotto\r\nrivalling Fingal’s Cave in celebrity, and no less wonderful in its\r\npeculiar style of beauty. As the roof of its narrow entrance rises only\r\na few feet above the level of the sea, it is probable that no human eye\r\nhad ever been delighted with its charms before 1826, when it was\r\naccidentally discovered by two Prussian artists who were swimming in the\r\nneighbourhood. After passing the low portal the cave widens to grand\r\nproportions, 125 feet long and 145 feet broad, and except a small\r\nlanding-place on a projecting rock at the further end, its precipitous\r\nwalls are on all sides bathed by the influx of the waters, which, in\r\nthat sea, are so clear that the smallest objects may be distinctly seen\r\non the bottom of the deep basin, the most beautiful bathing-place a\r\nmermaid might wish for. All the light that enters the grotto must first\r\npenetrate the whole depth of the waters before it can be reflected into\r\nthe cave, and it thus acquires so blue a tinge, from the large body of\r\nclear water through which it has passed, that the walls of the cavern\r\nare illumined by a radiance of the purest azure. Had Byron known of the\r\nexistence of this magic cave, Childe Harold would surely have devoted\r\nsome of his most brilliant stanzas to its praise.\r\n\r\nIn many other parts of the Mediterranean the limestone rocks that fringe\r\nits shores have been worn into magnificent caverns, less singular,\r\nindeed, than the fairy grot of Capri, but still of rare and wonderful\r\nbeauty. Such, among others, is the Antro di Nettuno, in the island of\r\nSardinia, about twelve miles from the small seaport of Alghero.[14]\r\n\r\nFootnote 14:\r\n\r\n  ‘The Sea and its Living Wonders,’ 3rd edit. p. 49.\r\n\r\nExceedingly picturesque caverns have also been worn by the chafing\r\nwaters in the chalk cliffs under Bonifacio, in the island of Corsica.\r\nTheir entrances festooned with hanging boughs, they penetrate far into\r\nthe interior of the rocks, and the water percolating through their\r\nvaulted roofs has formed stalactites of fantastic shapes. The boat\r\nglides through the arched entrance, and the glaring sunshine without is\r\nreplaced by cool and grateful shade. Fishes are flitting in the clear\r\nwater; limpid streams oozing through the rocks form crystal basins with\r\npebbly bottoms; and the channels from the blue sea, flowing over the\r\nchalk, become cerulean. Poetic fancy has never pictured anything more\r\nenchanting than these lovely caves.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CAVE UNDER BONIFACIO.]\r\n\r\nThe rocky coast of Sicily is likewise hollowed out with numerous marine\r\ngrottoes, which, though rarely noticed by travellers, may well be ranked\r\namongst the greatest natural beauties of the island. One of the most\r\nremarkable is the Grotta di Nettuno, near Syracuse, which, in calm\r\nweather, admits a boat to a considerable distance. Its rugged vaults\r\nrise to a height of about twenty or thirty feet, and are covered with\r\nstalactites wherever the water does not reach. There is no landing-\r\nplace, and throughout the whole cave the water is as deep as in the open\r\nsea beyond. Nothing can be more charming than to look back from the dark\r\nrecesses of the grotto upon the bright sunshine without, and to listen\r\nto the soothing murmurs of the clear waves as they ripple against the\r\nrocky walls. The atmosphere is so pure in this delicious climate that\r\nnot a trace of fog or mist obscures even the remotest parts of the cave,\r\nand the serene daylight falling through the entrance renders even its\r\ndeepest shadows translucent. Here a lover of nature might linger for\r\nhours enjoying the most delicious coolness, and watching the charming\r\neffects of light and shade in their ever-varying play.\r\n\r\nOn many rocky shores the ocean has worn out subterranean channels in the\r\ncliffs, against which it has been beating for ages, and then frequently\r\nemerges in water-spouts, or fountains, from the opposite end. Thus in\r\nthe Skerries, one of the Shetland Islands, a deep chasm or inlet, which\r\nis open overhead, is continued underground, and then again opens to the\r\nsky in the middle of the island. When the tide is high, the waves rise\r\nup through this inland aperture, with a noise like the blowing of a\r\nwhale.\r\n\r\nSimilar phenomena occur on the south side of the Mauritius,[15] on the\r\nnorth coast of Newfoundland, near Huatulco on the Mexican coast of the\r\nPacific, and near Peniscola, in Spain, where a cave, through whose roof\r\nat storm tides the sea bursts with a terrific noise, has received the\r\nname of the ‘Bufador, or the water-spout of Pope Luna,’ the family name\r\nof Benedict XIII., who, having been deposed by the Councils of Pisa and\r\nConstance, retired to the small Spanish town where he was born. As the\r\nchief occupation of the holy father in exile was to vent a continuous\r\ntorrent of curses and excommunications upon his numerous enemies, it is\r\nprobable that this circumstance caused his name to be given to the noisy\r\nbut harmless Bufador.\r\n\r\nFootnote 15:\r\n\r\n  ‘The Sea and its Living Wonders,’ 3rd edit. p. 52.\r\n\r\nThough water, aided by time, is probably the chief excavating power,\r\nthere can be no doubt that the action of subterranean fire has likewise\r\nproduced, and still produces, many hollows in the hard crust of the\r\nearth. Wherever a volcano has been piled up to the skies, the matter\r\nejected from its vents must necessarily have left a void behind, and\r\ngiven rise to corresponding cavities in the space beneath. The shock of\r\nan earthquake must frequently rend asunder deep-seated rocks, and the\r\nslow upheaval of considerable tracts of land can hardly be supposed to\r\ntake place without the formation of hollows and crevices.\r\n\r\nWhen the lavas poured forth during an eruption are in a liquid state,\r\nthey do not form on cooling a compact homogeneous mass, but generally\r\nexhibit a porous, spongy texture, due to the bubbles of the vapour\r\ngenerated through, or entangled in, their mass. These bubbles frequently\r\nunite in larger volumes, which, influenced by their elasticity and\r\ninferior specific gravity, rise towards the surface of the lava as it\r\nflows on, and, when sufficiently powerful, raise its crust in dome-like\r\nor conical protuberances, which not seldom burst open at the summit, or\r\ncrack at the sides. The hollows thus formed are often so large as to\r\nentitle them to the name of caves.\r\n\r\nAccording to Sir Charles Lyell, the sudden conversion into steam of\r\nlakes or streams of water, overwhelmed by a fiery current, may perhaps\r\nexplain the formation of many of the extensive underground passages or\r\ncaverns which form a common feature in the structure of a volcano. Great\r\nvolumes of vapour, thus produced, may force their way through liquid\r\nlava, already coated over externally with a solid crust, and may cause\r\nthe sides of such passages, as they harden, to assume a very irregular\r\noutline. The famous cave on Etna, called the Fossa della Palomba, which\r\nopens near Nicolosi, not far from Monte Rossi, has not improbably been\r\nthus formed. After reaching the bottom of a hollow 625 feet in\r\ncircumference at its mouth, and 78 feet deep, the explorer enters\r\nanother dark cavity, and then others in succession, sometimes descending\r\nprecipices by means of ladders. At length the vaults terminate in a\r\ngreat gallery ninety feet long, and from fifteen to fifty feet broad,\r\nbeyond which there is still a passage never yet visited, so that the\r\nwhole extent of the Fossa remains unknown.\r\n\r\nThe volcanic caves of Punta Delgada in the Island of San Miguel, one of\r\nthe Azores, are still more grand. Their entrance is through a narrow\r\ncrevice, which soon, however, expands into an enormous hall, whose vault\r\neven the strongest torch-light is unable to illumine. In one spot, an\r\nopening in the floor shows that the lava, which is here but a foot\r\nthick, forms the roof of a second cave, situated below the first, into\r\nwhich even the boldest explorer has never ventured, but the noise of\r\nstones cast into the abyss proves it to be of considerable size. The\r\nfirst-mentioned cave leads into another, the width of which is estimated\r\nby Webster[16] at 120 feet; but the height he was unable to measure.\r\nGradually this cave becomes narrower and lower, until, about 450 feet\r\nfrom the entrance, it terminates in a low vault. Black lava stalactites\r\neverywhere hang down from the roof, and the floor is so covered with\r\nsharp-sided blocks of the same volcanic material that walking among them\r\nbecomes a task of the greatest difficulty.\r\n\r\nFootnote 16:\r\n\r\n  ‘Description of the Island of Saint Michael.’\r\n\r\nWhile a lava-stream is flowing along, a slag-crust forms on its surface,\r\ninclosing the internal fluid matter as in a canal. But when the supply\r\nof fresh lava from the vent diminishes or entirely ceases, the still\r\nliquid interior at the central part of the current continuing for some\r\ntime to flow on, often leaves behind hollow gutters, arched over by a\r\nthin and brittle roof—so thin sometimes as to yield to the weight of a\r\nperson stepping on them. Such vaulted roofs have pseudo-stalactitic\r\nprojections left by the subsidence of the liquid, and are coated with a\r\nglossy varnish. Sometimes, very large caverns are thus formed beneath\r\nthe surface of a lava-stream, and even rival in their extent and\r\nwindings the caves worn by water in limestone rocks. The famous\r\nSurtshellir,[17] situated near Kalmanstunga in Iceland, is a remarkable\r\ninstance of a vast lava excavation owing its origin to this cause. It\r\nhas very appropriately been named after Surt, the prince of darkness and\r\nfire, of the ancient Scandinavian mythology; for this gloomy deity could\r\nnot possibly have chosen a fitter residence than its vast and dismal\r\nhalls, once glowing with subterranean fires, and now the seat of\r\nperpetual darkness.\r\n\r\nFootnote 17:\r\n\r\n  ‘The Polar World,’ p. 58.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XIII.\r\n                              CAVE RIVERS.\r\n\r\nThe Fountain of Vaucluse—The Fontaine-sans-fond—The Katabothra in Morea—\r\n  Subterranean Rivers in Carniola—Subterranean Navigation of the Poik in\r\n  the Cave of Planina—‘The Stalactital Paradise’—The Piuka Jama.\r\n\r\n\r\nWherever large bodies of water gush forth in a rapid stream from the\r\nbowels of the earth, they must either have flowed through wide\r\nunderground channels, or they must come from extensive lake-like\r\nreservoirs, for the mere drainage of a porous stratum is evidently\r\nincapable of accounting for their production.\r\n\r\nThus the celebrated fountain of Vaucluse, near Avignon, which has the\r\nvolume and power of a river at its very source, is undoubtedly fed by a\r\nsubterranean sheet of water of considerable extent. Even when least\r\nabundant, it pours forth upwards of 13,000 cubic feet of water in a\r\nminute; and after the country has been flooded with abundant rains, this\r\nvolume is increased fourfold. The environs of the fountain are extremely\r\npicturesque, and justify the praises which have been lavished upon it in\r\nthe immortal strains of Petrarch. It fills a large oval basin, vaulted\r\nby a spacious cave, and its waters, which, when low, escape through\r\nsubterranean channels into the deep bed of the Sorgue, rise, when high,\r\nover the rock-wall at the mouth of the grotto, and form a broad\r\ncataract, rushing down with a dreadful noise.\r\n\r\nNear Sable in Anjou, a source, or rather a pit from eighteen to twenty-\r\nfour feet in diameter, well known in the country under the name of the\r\nBottomless Fountain (_Fontaine-sans-fond_) sometimes overflows its\r\nbrink, and then casts forth a large quantity of fish, so that it is\r\nevidently a mere aperture in the vault of a large subterranean pool.\r\n\r\nIn the department of the Haute Saône, another pit, called the Frais\r\nPuits, presents a similar phenomenon. After abundant rains, the water\r\ngushing forth from its mouth inundates the neighbourhood, and on its\r\nretiring, pikes are not seldom found scattered over the surface of the\r\nflooded fields or meadows, a sure proof that the Puits must communicate\r\nwith a large subterranean cavity.\r\n\r\nNothing is more common in limestone districts than the engulfment of\r\nrivers, which, after holding a subterranean course of many miles, escape\r\nagain by some new outlet. The Guadiana loses itself in a flat country in\r\nthe midst of an immense savannah, and hence the Spaniards, when the\r\nmagnificent bridges of London or Paris are mentioned to them, boastfully\r\nreply that they have one in Estramadura on which more than a hundred\r\nthousand oxen graze at a time.\r\n\r\nIn the vast limestone formation which, under various names, extends\r\nthrough Carinthia, Carniola, Istria, Dalmatia, Albania, and Greece, the\r\nwhole country is perforated like a sponge by an intricate system of\r\nsubterranean water-courses. In the more elevated districts of the Morea\r\nthere are many deep land-locked valleys or basins inclosed on all sides\r\nby mountains of cavernous limestone. When the torrents are swollen by\r\nthe rains, they rush from the surrounding heights into these basins;\r\nbut, instead of forming temporary lakes, as would be the case in most\r\nother countries, they are swallowed by chasms, which are sometimes\r\nsituated in the middle of the plain, constituting the bottom of the\r\nclosed basin, but more commonly at the foot of the surrounding\r\nescarpment of limestone. During the dry season, which in Greece\r\nalternates almost as distinctly as between the tropics with a period of\r\nrain, these chasms are the favourite retreats of wild animals.\r\n\r\nSometimes, in the limestone formation, the same stream repeatedly gushes\r\nforth from some cavernous recess, and then again disappears. The caves\r\nof Adelsberg, Planina, and Upper Laibach in Carniola are traversed by\r\nthe same river, which, losing its name every time it plunges into a new\r\nsubterranean channel, is called, first, the Poik, then the Unz, and\r\nfinally the Laibach. In the same manner the Temenitz, an affluent of the\r\nSave, thrice disappears under the earth, and thrice emerges as a new-\r\nborn river with another name.\r\n\r\nAs far as these subterranean streams have been explored, their course\r\nexhibits a wonderful variety of interesting underground scenery.\r\nSometimes they form high cataracts, leaping over rocks so picturesquely\r\ngrouped that, were they illumined by the sun, and of more easy access,\r\nthey would be admired by numberless tourists; and not seldom they expand\r\ninto dark and melancholy lakes. Sometimes they with difficulty force a\r\npassage through a chaos of rocks, and then again they flow gently in a\r\ndeep and even channel, so as to be navigable to a considerable distance.\r\nGenerally, not the least breath of air sweeps over their placid waters,\r\nbut sometimes their surface is rippled by the wind pouring in through\r\nsome unseen chasm.\r\n\r\nAmong the bold explorers who have launched forth their barques on\r\nunknown subterranean rivers, the late Adolph Schmidl, of Vienna, holds a\r\nconspicuous rank. In a canoe specially constructed for the purpose he\r\ntrusted himself to the dark streams of Carniola, which rewarded his\r\nadventurous zeal with many a scene of incomparable beauty, where the\r\nwater-spirits and the gnomes seemed to have rivalled each other in the\r\nwork of decoration. To give an idea of the difficulties and of the\r\nenjoyments of these subterranean explorations, we will follow the\r\nintrepid naturalist on his voyages of discovery through the famous Cave\r\nof Planina, through which flows the Poik, a river which is at all times\r\ndeep enough to carry a boat. The course of the navigation is stream-\r\nupwards, and consequently much safer than would otherwise have been the\r\ncase; but in many places the rapidity of the current calls for great\r\ncaution, and considerable strength is needed to overcome its violence;\r\nwhile at the same time great care must be taken to avoid striking\r\nagainst the rocks that lie hidden under the water. As far as the end of\r\na magnificent dome, situated about 600 feet from its entrance, the cave\r\ncan be traversed on foot; but here the sullen stream, completely filling\r\nits whole width, compels the explorer to trust to his canoe. When he has\r\npassed a portal about eight fathoms high and half as broad, with\r\nproportions as symmetrical as if it had been sculptured by the hand of\r\nman, the thundering roar of a distant cataract announces still grander\r\nscenes. The portal widens, and the astonished explorer suddenly emerges\r\non a lake 250 feet long and 150 feet broad, beyond which the cave is\r\nseen to divide into two arms, giving passage to two streams, whose\r\nconfluent waters form the lake. This broad sheet of water affords an\r\nimposing but melancholy sight. The walls of the cave rise everywhere\r\nabruptly out of the water, with the exception of one small landing-place\r\nopposite to the portal at the foot of a projecting rock or promontory.\r\nHere and there large masses of stalactite hang like petrified cascades\r\nfrom the rocks, which are generally naked and black. The vault is so\r\nhigh that the light of a few torches fails to pierce its gloom, which is\r\nrendered still more impressive by the roar of the waterfall in the left\r\nbranch of the cavern.\r\n\r\nAs far as the lake, the cave is of comparatively easy access, and has\r\nbeen repeatedly visited, but the subterranean course of the two brooks\r\nbeyond was first explored by Dr. Schmidl. In the left or western branch\r\nof the cave, into which he penetrated to a distance of more than a mile,\r\nhis boat had to be unloaded no less than eleven times on account of the\r\nreefs that obstructed its passage, while the explorers, wading through\r\nthe water, dragged it over the shallows. Once even, where the navigation\r\nwas interrupted by large masses of rock, under which the tumultuous\r\nwaters disappear with a dreadful roar, they were obliged to take the\r\nlittle shallop to pieces, and to reconstruct it on the opposite side of\r\nthe mound. The navigable part of this western branch ends in a circular\r\ndome, the floor of which is entirely filled with a lake 180 feet long,\r\nand from 40 to 45 feet deep. On the western bank of this lake, a chasm\r\nopens at the top of a mound of rubbish, the only place where it is\r\npossible to land. A violent gust of wind descends from this chasm,\r\nwhich, sloping upwards, soon narrows to a small crevice, through which\r\nthe current of air sets in.\r\n\r\nTo a lateral gallery, opening beyond the mouth of the chasm, Dr. Schmidl\r\ngave the name of ‘The Stalactital Paradise,’ on account of the uncommon\r\nbeauty of the spar-crystals with which its walls were incrusted. It was\r\nthe first time that the foot of man had ever penetrated into this\r\ncharming laboratory of nature; no torch had ever soiled its brilliant\r\ndecorations; no profane hand had ever damaged its gem-like tapestry.\r\nHere whole groups of stalagmitic cones, of all shapes and sizes, some\r\nlike tiny icicles, others six feet high and as thick as a man’s waist,\r\nrose from the ground, while further on the brown wall formed a dark\r\nbackground, from which projected in bold relief the colossal statue of a\r\nsceptered king. Near the entrance stood a magnificent white figure,\r\nwhich fancy might have supposed to be a cherub with a flaming sword,\r\nmenacing all those who should dare to injure the wonders which he\r\nguarded.\r\n\r\n‘“The Stalactical Paradise” remained intact,’ says Dr. Schmidl.[18] ‘I\r\nbegged my companions not to strike off the smallest piece of spar as a\r\nmemorial of our visit, and they all joyfully consented. Our feet\r\ncarefully avoided trampling down any of its delicate ornaments; we left\r\nit with no other memorial than our admiration of its beauty. The nymphs\r\nof the grot will no doubt have pardoned us for having intruded upon the\r\nsanctuary, where for countless centuries they had reigned in undisturbed\r\nsolitude and silence.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 18:\r\n\r\n  ‘Die Höhlenkunde des Karstes.’ Wien, 1854.\r\n\r\nThe eastern branch of the cave, through which the main stream flows, is\r\nmuch larger than the branch above described; it is also easily\r\nnavigated, as it contains but two reefs and a small number of cliffs. On\r\nfirst ascending the stream, the continually increasing roar of waters\r\nannounces a considerable waterfall. Enormous masses of stone, piled up\r\nby the falling in of the roof, have blocked up and narrowed the bed of\r\nthe river to fifteen feet, and cause the stream to shoot down in a broad\r\nsheet ten feet high. The cataract, madly rushing over the jet-black\r\nrocks and casting up flakes of milk-white foam, is very beautiful, and,\r\nwhen brightly illuminated, must produce a truly magical effect.\r\n\r\nBeyond the cataract the river flows for a short space in an invisible\r\nchannel, as its waters are completely hidden under rocks. It was no easy\r\ntask to carry the planks of the dismembered boat over these rugged\r\nblocks of stone, but after reconstructing it on the opposite side of the\r\nmound, and overcoming the minor obstacles of a couple of reefs, the\r\nriver was found to flow in a deep channel between steep walls, and a\r\nfree navigation opened to a distance of at least a league and a half.\r\n\r\n‘No description,’ said Dr. Schmidl, ‘can do justice to the fascination\r\nof this subterranean voyage. In some parts the roof is adorned with\r\ncoral-shaped draperies of snow-white stalactites, but generally the\r\nwalls are mere black, naked stone. Here and there sources gurgle down\r\ntheir sides, and, along with the melancholy trickling of single drops of\r\nwater from the vault, alone break the silence of the dark interminable\r\ncave. The breathless attention we bestowed on the guidance of our boat\r\nand on the wonders that surrounded us sealed our lips, and we glided\r\nsilently along through the dark waters, that now, for the first time\r\nsince they began to flow, reflected the glare of a torch.’\r\n\r\nThroughout the whole distance of 1,140 fathoms beyond the second reef,\r\nthere is but one landing-place; everywhere else the walls rise\r\nprecipitously from the water. In some parts the roof descends so low\r\nthat the explorers were obliged to lie down in the boat and to shove it\r\nalong by holding to the projections of the vault, which finally left but\r\na few inches’ space above the water, and thus opposed an invincible\r\nobstacle to all further progress.\r\n\r\nIn another grotto—called the Piuka Jama—the Poik again flows in the\r\nmidst of the grandest subterranean scenery. About a league to the north\r\nof Adelsberg, the wanderer, after traversing a thicket of underwood,\r\nsuddenly finds himself on the brink of a yawning precipice, from the\r\nbottom of which is heard distinctly the noise of a rushing stream. The\r\nwalls of the chasm are almost perpendicular, except where a small\r\nravine, overgrown with shrubs, leads to an enormous rock, on which it is\r\npossible to stand, and, if perfectly free from giddiness, to look down\r\ninto the gulf below, where the huge portal of a cave is seen to open.\r\n\r\nFrom this rock, which projects over the abyss, the only descent is by\r\nmeans of a rope or a rope-ladder. The bottom of the pit is covered with\r\nlarge blocks of stone irregularly piled up, and here one first sees the\r\nriver rushing through the cave from right to left. The Piuka Jama may\r\nthus be compared to a window pierced through a vault overspanning a\r\nsubterranean stream. Clambering down a heap of rubbish, the explorer at\r\nlength stands upon the floor of the cave, and reaches the bank of the\r\nPoik. Stream-upwards, about 300 fathoms from the aperture, he meets with\r\na rock gate, through which the river rushes so violently that a boat can\r\nmaster the current only when the water is unusually low.\r\n\r\nAfter crossing this broad portal, the last faint traces of daylight\r\nglimmering from the distant aperture in the Piuka entirely disappear,\r\nand the scene suddenly changes. The expanding cavern assumes the\r\nproportions of an imposing dome. On its left side a mound has been\r\nformed by the falling in of the roof; but every block of stone is\r\ncompletely covered with calcareous incrustations of the purest white.\r\nFrom the floor to the centre of the vault millions upon millions of\r\nbrilliant spars reflect the light: every hollow in the walls is a\r\ncabinet of gems. The background of the dome completes the beauty of the\r\nscene, and exhibits one of the most imposing cavern decorations it is\r\npossible to imagine. A monstrous pillar rises from its centre, forming\r\ntwo colossal ogival portals. The larger one is on the left, and at its\r\nentrance a mighty stalagmite, above twelve feet high, seems to forbid\r\nintrusion. The pillar itself and the vaults of both the portals are\r\nornamented with the richest stalactital drapery.\r\n\r\nWhen the river is swollen it rushes tumultuously through both the gates,\r\nwhere now Dr. Schmidl found but a scanty rill whispering and babbling\r\namong the stones.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIV.\r\n                           SUBTERRANEAN LIFE.\r\n\r\nSubterranean Vegetation—Fungi—Enormous Fungus in a Tunnel near\r\n  Doncaster—Artificial Mushroom-beds near Paris—Subterranean Animals—The\r\n  Guacharo—Wholesale Slaughter—Insects in the Cave of Adelsberg—The\r\n  Leptodirus and the Blothrus—The Stalita tænaria—The Olm or Proteus—The\r\n  Lake of Cirknitz—The Archduke Ferdinand and Charon—The Blind Rat and\r\n  the Blind Fish of the Mammoth Cave.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf all the phenomena which attract the naturalist’s attention, as he\r\nwanders over the surface of the earth, there is none which makes a\r\ndeeper impression on his mind than the omnipresence of life. On the\r\nsnow-clad cone of Chimborazo, 18,000 feet above the level of the sea,\r\nHumboldt found butterflies and other winged insects, while, high over\r\nhis head, the condor was soaring in solitary majesty. At the still\r\ngreater elevation of 18,460 feet, at the Doonkiah Pass in the Himalaya\r\nMountains, Dr. Hooker plucked flowering plants, and saw large flocks of\r\nwild geese winging their flight above Kunchinjinga (22,750 feet) towards\r\nthe unknown regions of Central Asia. Thus man meets with life as far as\r\nhe is able to ascend, or as far as his sight plunges into the\r\natmospheric ocean. Besides the objects visible to his eye, innumerable\r\nmicroscopical organisms pervade the realms of air. According to\r\nEhrenberg’s brilliant discovery, the impalpably fine dust which, wafted\r\nby the Harmattan, often falls on ships when hundreds of miles from the\r\ncoast of Africa, consists of agglomerations of silica-coated diatoms,\r\nindividually so small as to be invisible to the naked eye; and\r\neverywhere numberless minute germs of future life—eggs of insects and\r\nsporules of cryptogamic plants—well fitted by cilia and feathery crowns\r\nfor an aërial journey, float up and down in the atmosphere; while the\r\nwaters of ocean are found, in like manner, filled with myriads of\r\nanimated atoms. But organic life not only occupies those parts of our\r\nglobe which are accessible to solar light; it also dives profoundly into\r\nthe subterranean world, wherever rain, or the melted snow, filtering\r\nthrough the porous earth, or through vents and crevices, is able to\r\npenetrate into natural caverns or artificial mines. For the combination\r\nof moisture, warmth, and air is able to develop organic life even\r\nthousands of feet below the surface of the earth; while light, though\r\nindispensable to most creatures, would blight and destroy the\r\ninhabitants of the subterranean vaults.\r\n\r\nOn surveying the flora of these dismal recesses, we find it consisting\r\nexclusively of mushrooms or fungi, the lowest forms of vegetation,\r\nwhich, shunning the light, love darkness and damp. Their appearance in\r\nthe caves is, as everywhere else, dependent upon the existence of an\r\norganic basis, and thus they are most commonly found germinating on\r\npieces of wood, particularly in a state of decomposition, which have\r\nbeen conveyed into the caverns either through the agency of man or by\r\nthe influx of water. Species of a peculiarly luxuriant growth are\r\nsometimes seen to spread over the neighbouring stones, or apparently to\r\nspring from the rocky ground, where, however, on closer inspection,\r\nvestiges of decayed organic substances will generally be detected.\r\n\r\nThus vegetation in caves most commonly keeps pace with the quantity of\r\nmouldering wood which they contain, and flourishes not only near their\r\nentrance but in their deepest recesses, as, for instance, in the Cave of\r\nAdelsberg, where, at a distance of more than a thousand fathoms from its\r\nentrance, the pegs which have been driven into the stalactital walls for\r\nthe purpose of measuring its length are covered with a rich coat of\r\nfungi. Nothing can be more curious than to see these plants, thriving\r\nand luxuriating in deep stillness and gloom, under circumstances so\r\nalien to the ordinary conditions of life. Among the fungi found in\r\ncaves, many also vegetate upon the surface of the earth exposed to the\r\ninfluence of light, and not seldom degenerate into monstrous forms in\r\ntheir less congenial subterranean abodes; but many are the exclusive\r\nchildren of darkness. The Austrian naturalist Scopoli published in 1772\r\nthe first exact description of more than seventy subterranean fungi,\r\ncollected chiefly in the mines of Schemnitz and Idria; and about twenty\r\nyears later Humboldt wrote his celebrated treatise on the same\r\nsubject.[19] Since then G. F. Hoffmann has described the subterranean\r\nflora of the Harz Mountains;[20] and latterly the botanists Welwitsch\r\nand Pokorny have examined the caves of Carinthia, where they discovered\r\nno less than eighteen species of fungi, among others the mouse-tail\r\nmushroom (_Agaricus myurus_, Hoffm.), which is also found in the Harz,\r\nand bears on a slender hairy stalk, more than a foot long, a small hat,\r\nscarcely a quarter of an inch in diameter. Some of these fungi are\r\nremarkable for their size (_Thelephora rubiginosa sanguinolenta_),\r\nothers for their elegance (_Diderma nigripes_).\r\n\r\nFootnote 19:\r\n\r\n  ‘Flora Fribergensis Plantas Cryptogamicas præsertim subterraneas\r\n  exhibens.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 20:\r\n\r\n  ‘Vegetabilia in Hercyniæ Subterraneis collecta Norinbergæ.’ 1811.\r\n\r\nSome years ago a gigantic fungus, found growing from the woodwork of a\r\ntunnel near Doncaster, afforded a striking proof of the luxuriancy of\r\nsubterranean vegetation. It measured no less than fifteen feet in\r\ndiameter, and was, in its way, as great a curiosity as one of the\r\ncolossal trees of California.\r\n\r\nEven the plants that flourish in the darkness of caves have been\r\nrendered subservient to our use. The cultivation of the edible mushroom\r\nin spacious caverns or ancient quarries is practised to a great extent\r\nin the environs of Paris, at Arcueil, Moulin de la Roche, and St.\r\nGermain, but particularly at Montrouge, on the southern side of the\r\ncity. The mushroom-beds are entirely underground, seventy or eighty feet\r\nbelow the surface, at a depth where the temperature is nearly uniform\r\nall the year round. These extensive catacombs, formed by long burrowing\r\ngalleries, have no opening but by a circular shaft, to be descended by\r\nclambering down a perpendicular pole or mast, into the sides of which\r\nlarge wooden pegs are fixed, at intervals of ten or twelve inches, to\r\nrest the feet upon.\r\n\r\nThe baskets containing the ripe mushrooms are hoisted from below by a\r\npulley and rope. The compost in which they grow consists of a white\r\ngritty earth, mixed with good stable manure, and is moulded into narrow\r\nbeds about twenty inches high, ranged along the sides of the passages or\r\ngalleries, and kept exquisitely neat and smooth. The mushroom sporules\r\nare introduced to the beds either by flakes of earth taken from an old\r\nbed, or else from a heap of decomposing stable manure in which mushrooms\r\nhave naturally been engendered. The beds are covered with a layer of\r\nearth an inch thick, the earth being merely the white rubbish left by\r\nthe stone-cutters above. They must be well watered, and removed after\r\ntwo or three months, when their bearing qualities are exhausted. In one\r\nof the caves at Montrouge alone there are six or seven miles of\r\nmushroom-bedding, a proof that this branch of industry is by no means\r\nunimportant.\r\n\r\nWhile subterranean vegetation is exclusively confined to mushrooms,\r\nanimal life of almost every class has far more abundant representatives,\r\nfor plants are in general much more dependent on the vivifying influence\r\nof light.\r\n\r\nThe various animals which are found dwelling in caves may be subdivided\r\ninto two groups; one, which, though preferring darkness, and spending a\r\ngreat part of its existence under the earth, yet often voluntarily seeks\r\nthe light of day, or at least wanders forth at night; while the other is\r\n_exclusively_ subterranean, and is never seen above the surface of the\r\nearth, unless by chance or when driven up by violence.\r\n\r\nTo the first group belong most of the insectivorous and rodent\r\nquadrupeds that dwell in self-made burrows, or pursue a subterranean\r\nprey, such as the armadilloes and the moles. The large family of the\r\nbats likewise love to sleep by day, or to hibernate in warm and solitary\r\ncaves, where they are sometimes found in numbers as countless as the\r\nsea-birds which flock round some rocky island of the north. When\r\nProfessor Silliman visited the Mammoth Cave (October 16, 1822), he\r\neverywhere saw them suspended in dense clusters from the roofs, though a\r\nlarge number had not yet retired into winter-quarters. In a small space,\r\nscarcely four or five inches square, he counted no less than forty bats,\r\nand convinced himself that at least one hundred and twenty find room on\r\na square foot, as they held not only by the surface of the walls of\r\ntheir retreat, but by each other, one closely crowding over another.\r\nSuch clusters are found in the interior of the cavern, which branches\r\nout in many directions as far as two miles from the entrance, so that a\r\nvery superficial survey allows them to be counted by millions. Who, in\r\nthese dismal regions, where no change of temperature or of light\r\nannounces the various seasons, tells them that the reign of winter is\r\npast? who awakes them at the proper time out of the deep sleep in which\r\nthey remain plunged for months? The same mysterious voice of instinct\r\nwhich regulates the migrations of the birds and the wanderings of the\r\nfishes, and which in this case, as in every other, is equally wonderful\r\nand incomprehensible.\r\n\r\nIn the class of birds we find many cave-haunting species. The pigeons\r\nlike to nestle in grottoes, which also serve as welcome retreats to the\r\nmoping owl; and various swallows and swifts breed chiefly in the\r\ndarkness of caverns. One of the most remarkable of these troglodytic\r\nbirds is the Guacharo, which inhabits a large cave in the Valley of\r\nCaripe, near the town of Cumana, and of which an interesting account has\r\nbeen given by Humboldt, who first introduced it to the notice of Europe.\r\n\r\nThe _Gueva del Guacharo_ is pierced in the vertical profile of a rock,\r\nand the entrance is towards the south, forming a noble vault eighty feet\r\nbroad and seventy-two feet high. The rock surmounting the cavern is\r\ncovered with trees of gigantic growth, and all the luxuriant profusion\r\nof an inter-tropical vegetation. Plantain-leaved heliconias, and\r\nwondrous orchids, the Praga palm, and tree arums, grow along the banks\r\nof a river that flows out of the cave, while lianas, and a variety of\r\ncreeping plants, rocked to and fro by the wind, form elegant festoons\r\nbefore its entrance. What a contrast between this magnificently\r\ndecorated portal and the gloomy mouth of the Surtshellir, imbedded in\r\nthe lava wildernesses of Iceland? As the cave at first penetrates into\r\nthe mountain in a straight direction, the light of day does not\r\ndisappear for a considerable distance from the entrance, so that\r\nvisitors are able to go forward for about four hundred and thirty feet\r\nwithout being obliged to light their torches; and here, where light\r\nbegins to fail, the hoarse cries of the nocturnal birds are heard from\r\nafar.\r\n\r\nThe guacharo is of the size of the common fowl. Its hooked bill is wide,\r\nlike that of the goat-sucker, and furnished at the base with stiff hairs\r\ndirected forwards. The plumage, like that of most nocturnal birds, is\r\nsombre brownish grey, mixed with black stripes and large white spots.\r\nThe eyes are incapable of bearing the light of day, and the wings are\r\ndisproportionately large, measuring not less than four feet and a half\r\nfrom tip to tip. It quits the cavern only at nightfall, especially when\r\nthere is moonlight; and Humboldt remarks that it is almost the only\r\nfrugivorous nocturnal bird yet known, for it does not prey upon insects\r\nlike the goatsucker, but feeds on very hard fruits, which its strong\r\nhooked beak is well fitted to crack. The horrible noise made by\r\nthousands of these birds in the dark recesses of the cavern can be\r\ncompared only to the wild shrieks of the sea-mews round a solitary bird\r\nmountain, or to the deafening uproar of the crows when assembled in vast\r\nflocks in the dark fir-forests of the North. The clamour increases on\r\nadvancing deeper into the cave, the birds being disturbed by the torch-\r\nlight; and as those nestling in the side avenues of the cave begin to\r\nutter their mournful cries when the first sink into silence, it seems as\r\nif their troops were alternately complaining to each other of the\r\nintruders. By fixing torches to the end of long poles, the Indians, who\r\nserve as guides into the cavern, show the nests of these birds, fifty or\r\nsixty feet above the heads of the explorers, in funnel-shaped holes with\r\nwhich the cavern roof is pierced like a sieve.\r\n\r\nOnce a year, about midsummer, the Guacharo Cavern is entered by the\r\nIndians. Armed with poles they ransack the greater part of the nests,\r\nwhile the old birds, uttering lamentable cries, hover over the heads of\r\nthe robbers. The young which fall down are opened on the spot. The\r\nperitonæum is found loaded with fat, and a layer of the same substance\r\nreaches from the abdomen to the vent, forming a kind of cushion between\r\nthe birds’ legs. The European nocturnal birds are meagre, as, instead of\r\nfeasting on fruits and oily kernels, they live upon the scanty produce\r\nof the chase; while in the guacharo, as in our fattened geese, the\r\naccumulation of fat is promoted by darkness and abundant food. At the\r\nperiod above mentioned, which is known at Caripe as the ‘oil harvest,’\r\nhuts are erected by the Indians with palm leaves near the entrance, and\r\neven in the very porch of the cavern. There the fat of the young birds\r\njust killed is melted in clay pots over a brushwood fire, and is said to\r\nbe very pure and of a good taste. Its small quantity, however, is quite\r\nout of proportion to the numbers killed, as not more than 150 or 160\r\njars of perfectly clear oil are collected from the massacre of\r\nthousands.\r\n\r\nThe way into the interior of the cavern leads along the banks of the\r\nsmall river which flows through its dark recesses; but sometimes large\r\nmasses of stalactites obstruct the passage, and force the visitor to\r\nwade through the water, which is, however, not more than two feet deep.\r\nAs far as 1,458 feet from the entrance the cave maintains the same\r\ndirection, width, and height of sixty or seventy feet, so that it would\r\nbe difficult to find another mountain cavern of so regular a formation.\r\nHumboldt had great difficulty in persuading the natives to pass beyond\r\nthe part of the cave which they usually visit to collect the oil, as\r\nthey believed its deeper penetralia to be the abode of their ancestors’\r\nspirits; but since the great naturalist’s visit, they seem to have\r\nabandoned their ancient superstitions, or to have acquired a greater\r\ncourage in facing the mysteries of the grotto, for, while they would\r\nonly accompany Humboldt as far as 236 fathoms into the interior of the\r\ncave, later travellers, such as Codazzi and Beaupertuis, have advanced\r\nwith their guides to double the distance, though without reaching its\r\nend. They found that beyond the furthest point explored by Humboldt the\r\ncave loses its regularity, and has its walls covered with stalactites.\r\nIn the embranchments of the grotto Codazzi found innumerable birds. It\r\nwas formerly supposed that the guacharo was exclusively confined to this\r\ncave; latterly, however, it has also been found in the province of\r\nBogota.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of animals adapted for perpetual darkness is but of modern\r\ndate, and as the vast majority of caves have not yet been thoroughly\r\nexplored by zoologists, the number of genera and species already known\r\ngives us reason to believe that future investigations will add\r\nconsiderably to their number. In the Adelsberg, Lueg, and Magdalena\r\ngrottoes, which form but an inconsiderable part of the extensive\r\ncavernous regions of Carniola, seven exclusively subterranean insects,\r\none spider, two scorpionides, one millepede, two crustaceans, one snail,\r\nand one reptile—in all fifteen different species of animals, belonging\r\nto no less than six different classes—have been found.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LEPTODIRUS HOCHENWARTII.]\r\n\r\nAmong these dwellers of the dark, warfare is as rife as in the regions\r\nof light. Thus, in the recesses of the Grotto of Adelsberg, the cavern\r\nbeetle (_Leptodirus Hochenwartii_) is persecuted and devoured by the\r\nscorpioniform _Blothrus spelæus_, and by the eyeless spider (_Stalita\r\ntænaria_). The black and brown Leptodirus discovered in the Grotto of\r\nAdelsberg in 1831, by Count Hochenwart, is distinguished by long and\r\ndelicate antennæ and legs, and comparatively small translucent and\r\nsmooth elytra. The unique specimen found at the time was unfortunately\r\nlost, and although twenty-five florins were offered to the cavern guides\r\nfor one of these beetles, fourteen years passed before it was re-\r\ndiscovered in the same cave. Since then other collectors have been more\r\nfortunate, particularly Prince Robert Khevenhüller, who, during his\r\nrepeated visits to the Cave of Adelsberg, captured no less than twenty\r\nspecimens of the Leptodirus.\r\n\r\nCautiously feeling its way with its long antennæ, the beetle slowly\r\nascends the damp stalactital columns, and accelerates its movements at\r\nthe approach of a light. The greater number were found in the evening,\r\nthus giving reason for supposing that the Leptodirus is a noctural\r\nbeetle, although it is hardly possible to conceive how the alternating\r\ninfluence of night and day can still be felt in these regions of\r\ndarkness. The manner in which it is pursued by the eyeless Blothrus\r\n(discovered in 1833, by Mr. F. Schmidt), has been several times observed\r\nby Prince Khevenhüller. He once saw one of these cavern scorpions slowly\r\ncrawling along, stretching out its palpi in all directions, and\r\nevidently on the search. He immediately guessed that the animal was\r\nengaged in a hunting expedition, and soon found that he was not\r\nmistaken, for a fine Leptodirus was crawling about four feet higher on\r\nthe opposite wall. For a long time the Prince left the two insects\r\nundisturbed, until he had thoroughly convinced himself that the\r\nmovements of the Blothrus were evidently regulated by those of the\r\nLeptodirus, and that the former was, beyond all doubt, in pursuit of the\r\nbeetle. A Leptodirus having been thrown along with a Blothrus into a\r\nphial, was immediately cut to pieces and devoured.\r\n\r\nThe eyeless cavern spider (_Stalita tænaria_), with brownish palpæ and a\r\nsnow-white abdomen, is not seldom found in the hollows of the\r\nstalactites, lying in wait for the unfortunate Leptodirus. On the\r\nsurface of the earth spiders are frequently obliged to fast for a very\r\nlong time; but in caverns where life is so sparingly distributed, the\r\npatience of the Stalita must be exemplary, even among spiders. Her\r\nappearance on the snow-white stalactital columns, where she only becomes\r\nvisible when illumined by the full light of a taper,[21] is very\r\nstriking. Like a vision, she sweeps away in her ivory robe, accompanied\r\nby her increasing shadow, until she finally disappears in the darkness.\r\n\r\nFootnote 21:\r\n\r\n  Torches are not allowed to be carried in the Grotto of Adelsberg, that\r\n  the whiteness of the stalactites may not be tarnished by the smoke.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE PROTEUS AGUINUS.]\r\n\r\nBut the largest and most interesting of all the European cave animals is\r\nundoubtedly the Olm (_Proteus anguinus; Hypochthon_). This enigmatic\r\nreptile was first found in the famous Lake of Cirknitz, which,\r\ncommunicating with numerous subterranean caves, alternately receives and\r\nloses its waters through openings in the rock. After long and heavy\r\nrains the floods, which the hidden vaults are no longer able to contain,\r\ngush forth in foaming cataracts, and the lake, which generally forms but\r\na long and narrow channel, then swells to at least three times its\r\nordinary width. Sometimes, after a long drought, the contrary takes\r\nplace, and the whole lake disappears under ground. Thus, from December\r\n1833 to October 1834, not a trace of it was visible, so thoroughly had\r\nit concealed itself in its subterranean reservoirs, where its fishes,\r\nsecure from the persecutions of man, multiplied in a remarkable manner.\r\nThe Olm, which only casually comes to the light of day, along with the\r\noverflowing waters of the Cirknitz Lake, was first discovered in 1814,\r\nin one of its permanent subterranean abodes. The Magdalena or ‘Black\r\nGrotto’ situated about a league to the north of Adelsberg, slants\r\nabruptly into the bowels of the mountain. After a long and difficult\r\npassage over blocks of stone or through soft mud, a tranquil pool is at\r\nlength reached, which rises or falls simultaneously with the waters of\r\nthe Poik, and proves, by this reciprocal action, that, in all\r\nprobability, all the numerous grottoes and subterranean river channels\r\nof this so strangely undermined country form but one vast and intricate\r\nnetwork. It was in this pool, which no light illumines and no wind ever\r\nstirs, that numerous Protei were first discovered; but as hundreds of\r\nspecimens have since found their way to the cabinets of naturalists, to\r\nbe observed, dissected, or bottled up in spirits, their number has very\r\nmuch decreased, and the time is perhaps not far distant when they will\r\nbe entirely extirpated in the grotto, where from time immemorial they\r\nhad enjoyed an undisturbed security. The Proteus is one of those\r\nremarkable reptiles which breathe at the same time through lungs and\r\ngills, having on each side of the neck three rose-red branchiæ, which it\r\nretains through life, as its lungs are but imperfectly developed. It has\r\na long, eel-like body with an elongated head, a compressed tail, and\r\nfour very short and thin legs. The skin is flesh-coloured, and so\r\ntranslucent that the liver and the heart, which beats about fifty times\r\nin a minute, can be distinctly seen underneath. In spite of its apparent\r\nweakness, it is able to glide rapidly through the water. Its four little\r\nlegs remain immovable while swimming; they are only used for creeping,\r\nand then in a very imperfect manner. During rapid movements the gills\r\nswell and assume a lively scarlet colour; when quiet, they collapse and\r\nbecome white like the rest of the body. Sometimes the animal raises its\r\nhead above the water to breathe, but pulmonary respiration evidently\r\nplays but a secondary part in its economy, as it can only live a very\r\nshort time out of the water. The skeleton consists almost entirely of\r\ncartilage. The eyes, two little black spots, lie buried under the skin,\r\nand, as may well be imagined, are very imperfectly developed. Although\r\nmore than a thousand specimens have been observed, yet but little is\r\nknown about its mode of life, nor has it been ascertained whether it is\r\noviparous or brings forth live young. In a captive state the Proteus is\r\nable to live for several years without any apparent food; but on\r\nfastening a small worm to the extremity of a thin stick, and holding it\r\nunder the water close to the head of the reptile, it shoots rapidly\r\ntowards it, swallows it with the same velocity, then ejects it again,\r\nand repeats this manœuvre several times, until it finally retains the\r\nmorsel. The untiring zeal of the German naturalists has discovered the\r\nProteus in thirty-one different caverns, and ascertained seven distinct\r\nspecies, varying by their size, the form of the head, the position of\r\nthe eyes, and the colour of the skin. Six of these species belong to the\r\ncaverns of Carniola, and the seventh to those of Dalmatia. Two different\r\nspecies never inhabit the same cavern.\r\n\r\nDuring the visit which the Archduke Ferdinand paid, in 1819, to the\r\nMagdalena Grotto, the most remarkable parts of the cave were brilliantly\r\nilluminated, so as to produce a magical effect. Charon’s boat, issuing\r\nfrom a dark recess, came gliding along over the black surface of the\r\npool. The grim ferryman drew up his net before the august visitors, and\r\npresented them with six Protei that had been entangled in its meshes.\r\nDr. Schmidl mentions part of the subterranean river in the Planina Cave,\r\n1,715 fathoms from the entrance, as the spot where the Protei are most\r\nabundant. Near to a small cascade which the rivulet here forms over a\r\nreef, the waters absolutely swarm with them, and the light-coloured\r\nanimals, darting about in all directions in the dark stream, afford a\r\nstrange and picturesque spectacle. As the cavern is of most difficult\r\naccess, they here enjoy a tranquillity rarely disturbed, and no doubt\r\nthey have many other still more hidden retreats, to which man is\r\nincapable of penetrating. The best method for transporting the Proteus\r\nis now perfectly understood, and living specimens have been conveyed as\r\nfar as Russia, Hungary, and Scotland. All that they need is a frequent\r\nsupply of fresh water, and a careful removal of all light. Their food\r\nneed cause no trouble, as the water contains all they require. It is\r\nrecommended to lay a piece of stalactite from their native grotto in the\r\nvase in which they are transported. When resting or sleeping, they then\r\ncoil themselves round the stone, as if tenderly embracing it. In this\r\nmanner they have already been kept above five years out of their\r\ncaverns. The guides to the Grotto of Adelsberg have always got a supply\r\non hand, and sell them for about two florins a-piece.\r\n\r\nOn turning our attention from the grottoes of Carniola to those of the\r\nNew World, we find, in the vast Mammoth Cave in Kentucky, a no less\r\ninteresting animal creation, which, though different from that of the\r\nAustrian caverns, still shows a certain family resemblance, and affords\r\nanother proof that a similarity of external circumstances always\r\nproduces analogous forms of organic life. Thus, the two blind beetles\r\nwhich are found in the Mammoth Cave belong to the same genera\r\n(_Anophthalmus_ and _Adelops_) that have also their representatives in\r\nthe Grotto of Adelsberg. The largest insect is here a species of\r\ncricket, with enormously long antennæ; there are also two small white\r\neyeless spiders and a few crustaceans. The Mammoth Cave has no\r\nproteiform reptile to boast of, but a peculiar blind rat and a peculiar\r\nblind fish.\r\n\r\nThe cavern rat, which is tolerably numerous, but which, on account of\r\nits remarkable timidity, seldom shows itself, differs from the common or\r\nNorway rat, by its bluish colour, its white abdomen, neck, and feet, and\r\nits soft hair. It has large black eyes, like those of a rabbit, but\r\nentirely destitute of an iris, and uncommonly long whiskers, as if\r\nNature had wished to indemnify it for the loss of sight by a more\r\nperfect development of the sense of touch. Although the eyes of this rat\r\nare large and brilliant, yet Professor Silliman convinced himself of\r\ntheir perfect insensibility to light. All proof is wanting that it ever\r\nvisits the upper world.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BLIND FISH (AMBLYOPSIS SPELÆUS).]\r\n\r\nThe blind fish (_Amblyopsis spelæus_) is now become tolerably rare from\r\nits having been so frequently fished out of the Lethe stream, as the\r\nsubterranean river of the Mammoth Cave is called. Many physiologists\r\nhave already made it the subject of their observations, and are\r\ngenerally of opinion that the Amblyopsis was not originally blind, but\r\nthat, having found its way into the cave, it gradually lost its powers\r\nof vision. The celebrated naturalist Agassiz, however, being perfectly\r\nconvinced that all animals existing in a wild state have been created\r\nwithin their actual bounds with all the peculiarities of structure which\r\ndistinguish them at the present day, is of opinion that the blind fish\r\nand all the other blind animals of the Mammoth Cave are the aboriginal\r\nchildren of darkness, and have at no time been connected with the world\r\nof light.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XV.\r\n                       CAVES AS PLACES OF REFUGE.\r\n\r\nThe Cave of Adullam—Mahomet in the Cave of Thaur—The Cave of Longara—The\r\n  Cave of Egg—The Caves of Rathlin—The Cave of Yeermalik—The Caves of\r\n  Granada—Aben Aboo, the Morisco king—The Caves of Gortyna and Melidoni—\r\n  Atrocities of French Warfare in Algeria—The Caves of the Dahra—The\r\n  Cave of Shelas—St. Arnaud.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn times of war or persecution, caverns have often served as places of\r\nconcealment. It was in the cave of Adullam that David hid himself to\r\nescape from the fury of Saul; and on the flight from Mecca to Medina,\r\nMahomet and his disciple Abu Bekr took refuge in a cave in Mount Thaur.\r\nThey left Mecca while it was yet dark, making their way on foot by the\r\nlight of the stars, and the day dawned as they found themselves at the\r\nfoot of the hill, about an hour’s distance from the holy city. Scarcely\r\nwere they within the cave when they heard the sound of pursuit. Abu\r\nBekr, though a brave man, quaked with fear. ‘Our pursuers,’ said he,\r\n‘are many, and we are but two.’ ‘Nay,’ replied Mahomet, ‘there is a\r\nthird: God is with us!’\r\n\r\nAnd here the Moslem writers relate a miracle dear to the minds of true\r\nbelievers. By the time, say they, that his pursuers, the Koreishites,\r\nreached the mouth of the cave, an acacia-tree had sprung up before it,\r\nin the spreading branches of which a pigeon had made its nest and laid\r\nits eggs, and over the whole a spider had woven its web. When the\r\nKoreishites beheld these signs of undisturbed quiet, they concluded that\r\nno one could recently have entered the cavern, so they turned away and\r\npursued their search in another direction.\r\n\r\nBut caverns have not always proved safe places of refuge, and a\r\nbarbarous enemy has often used them for the destruction of those who\r\nthere vainly sought safety. Thus, in Palestine, the Jews, who hid\r\nthemselves with their wives and children in deep caverns hollowed in the\r\nflanks of a precipitous mountain, could not escape the satellites of\r\nHerod, who, let down from above in large baskets or tubs, put these\r\ndefenceless fugitives to the sword. During the Gallic war Cæsar ordered\r\nhis lieutenant Crassus to wall up the mouths of the caves in which the\r\ninhabitants of Aquitaine had sought a refuge, and many of them were thus\r\nimmured alive.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1510, when the French army, on its retreat from Italy, was\r\ntraversing the defiles of Piedmont, the rearguard, commanded by the\r\nfamous Chevalier Bayard, the good knight ‘without fear or reproach,’\r\nhaving halted at Longara, the mercenaries, who formed a considerable\r\npart of his troops, spread over the country, pillaging and destroying\r\nwherever they went.\r\n\r\nTo escape from these savage bands, the nobles of the district persuaded\r\nabout two thousand of the peasantry to accompany them, with their\r\nfamilies and an abundant supply of provisions, into the Cave of Longara,\r\nwhich forms a vast though low vaulted hall, about 1,200 feet long and\r\n300 feet broad, but with an entrance so narrow that only a single person\r\ncan pass at a time. The mercenaries, having discovered the secret of the\r\ncave, rushed to the spot, eager for pillage. The unfortunate refugees\r\nvainly strove to soften the hearts of these barbarians, but, finding all\r\nsupplications vain, they took courage from despair, and, favoured by the\r\nnatural strength of the cave, repelled the attack of the first banditti\r\nwho attempted to force an entrance.\r\n\r\nThe ruffians now returned to the charge in greater numbers; but being\r\nstill unable to accomplish their object, they formed the diabolical plan\r\nof setting fire to a heap of hay, straw, and greenwood, which they piled\r\nup before the mouth of the grotto. The smoke penetrated into the cave\r\nand in a short time the two thousand wretches it contained—mostly women\r\nand children—were suffocated. Bayard, enraged at this barbarous act,\r\nwhich sullied his own honour, ordered the ringleaders to be seized and\r\nhanged before the entrance of the cave.\r\n\r\nWhile these malefactors were in the hands of the executioner, a lad of\r\nfourteen, the only survivor of the catastrophe, was seen to crawl out of\r\nthe grotto. Bayard ordered every aid to be rendered him which his state\r\nrequired, and could not refrain from tears while listening to his\r\nlamentable tale. The boy related that when the smoke began to spread in\r\nthe cavern, the nobles, resolving to die at least like soldiers, wanted\r\nto sally forth, sword in hand, but were prevented by the peasants, who\r\nfell upon them and disarmed them, saying, ‘You have led us hither, and\r\nhere with us you shall die!’ Thus, a few moments before a common doom\r\nwas to destroy both nobles and serfs, a horrible strife had arisen\r\nbetween them in the darkness of the cave.\r\n\r\n‘And thou, my friend,’ asked Bayard, ‘by what miracle hast thou escaped\r\ndeath?’ ‘I had remarked,’ answered the lad, ‘a feeble ray of daylight in\r\na corner of the grotto, and applied my mouth to the crevice through\r\nwhich it passed. I soon fainted, but this small portion of fresh air\r\npreserved my life. When I recovered my senses, I remembered all that had\r\npassed, but I was alone, and it took me a long time to crawl out of the\r\ngrotto.’ ‘All thy companions,’ answered Bayard, ‘have been buried, by my\r\norders, in consecrated ground; and behold! there hang their assassins!’\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the history of our land is tarnished with similar deeds of\r\natrocity.\r\n\r\nA cave in the Isle of Egg, one of the Hebrides, has a very narrow\r\nentrance, through which one can hardly creep on knees and hands, but it\r\nrises steep and lofty within, and runs into the bowels of the rock to\r\nthe depth of 255 measured feet. The rude and stony bottom of this cave\r\nis strewed with the bones of men, women, and children, the sad relics of\r\nthe ancient inhabitants of the island, 200 in number, of whose\r\ndestruction the following story is related. ‘The Macdonalds, of the Isle\r\nof Egg, a people dependent on Clanranald, had done some injury to the\r\nLaird of Macleod. The tradition of the isle says that it was by a\r\npersonal attack on the chieftain, in which his back was broken; but that\r\nof the other isles bears that the injury was offered to two or three of\r\nthe Macleods, who, landing upon Egg, and behaving insolently towards the\r\nislanders, were bound hand and foot, and turned adrift in a boat, which\r\nthe winds and waves safely conducted to Skye. To avenge the offence\r\ngiven, Macleod sailed with such a body of men as rendered resistance\r\nhopeless. The natives, fearing his vengeance, concealed themselves in\r\nthe cavern; and, after strict search, the Macleods went on board their\r\ngalleys, after doing what mischief they could, concluding the\r\ninhabitants had left the isle. But next morning they espied from their\r\nvessels a man upon the island, and, immediately landing again, they\r\ntraced his retreat, by means of a light snow on the ground, to the\r\ncavern. Macleod then summoned the subterraneous garrison, and demanded\r\nthat the inhabitants who had offended him should be delivered up. This\r\nwas peremptorily refused. The chieftain thereupon caused his people to\r\ndivert the course of a rill of water, which, falling over the mouth of\r\nthe cave, would have prevented his purposed vengeance. He then kindled\r\nat the entrance of the cavern a huge fire, and maintained it until all\r\nwithin were destroyed by suffocation.’[22]\r\n\r\nFootnote 22:\r\n\r\n  Voyages in the Lighthouse Yacht, published in Lockhart’s ‘Life of Sir\r\n  Walter Scott.’\r\n\r\nIn the reign of Queen Elizabeth, a no less horrible deed occurred during\r\nthe campaign of Essex against the Irish rebels. When the English forces\r\nentered Antrim, the Scots of that county had sent their wives and\r\nchildren, their aged and their sick, to the island of Rathlin for\r\nsafety. Sir John Norris was directed by the Earl to cross over and kill\r\nall that he could find. The run up the Antrim coast was rapidly and\r\nquietly accomplished. Before an alarm could be given the English had\r\nlanded close to the church which bears Columba’s name. The castle was\r\ntaken by storm, and every soul in it—about two hundred—put to the sword.\r\nIt was then discovered that the greater part of the fugitives, chiefly\r\nmothers and their little ones, were hidden in the caves about the\r\nshores. ‘There was no remorse,’ says Froude, ‘not even the faintest\r\nshadow of perception that the occasion called for it. They were hunted\r\nout as if they had been seals or otters, and all destroyed.’\r\n\r\nWhen the barbarian Genghis Khan invaded Koondooz in Central Asia, 700\r\nmen took refuge, with their wives and families, in the cave of\r\nYeermalik, and defended themselves so valiantly that, after trying in\r\nvain to destroy them by fire, the invader built them in with huge\r\nnatural blocks of stone, and left them to die of hunger. In the year\r\n1840, the cave was visited by Captain Burslem and Lieutenant Sturt,\r\nprobably the only Europeans that ever entered its sepulchral recesses,\r\nas the people in the neighbourhood believe it to be the abode of Sheitan\r\n(the devil), and are as reluctant to guide a stranger as to explore it\r\nthemselves. The entrance is halfway up a hill, and is fifty feet high,\r\nwith about the same breadth. Not far from the entrance the travellers\r\nfound a passage between two jagged rocks, possibly the remains of\r\nGenghis Khan’s fatal wall, so narrow that they had some difficulty in\r\nsqueezing through, and then before long came to a drop of sixteen feet,\r\ndown which they were lowered by ropes. Here they left two men to haul\r\nthem up on their return, and bade farewell to the light of day. The\r\nnarrow path, which led by the edge of a black abyss, sometimes over a\r\nflooring of smooth ice for a few feet, widened gradually till they\r\nreached a damp and dripping hall, so vast in size that the light of\r\ntheir torches did not enable them to form any idea of its size. In this\r\ncolossal hall, or rather tomb, they found the remains of the victims of\r\nGenghis Khan: hundreds of skeletons in a perfectly undisturbed state—\r\none, for instance, still holding the skeletons of two infants in its\r\nlong arms—while some of the bodies had been preserved, and lay\r\nshrivelled, like the mummies reposing in the sepulchral vault of the\r\nGreat St. Bernard.\r\n\r\nIn the dark history of Philip II. of Spain, one of the darkest passages\r\nis that of the rebellion and final destruction of the Moors of Granada.\r\nDriven to despair by an intolerable tyranny, the unfortunate people at\r\nlength rose in arms against their oppressors; but all their bravery,\r\naided by the natural strength of their mountain fastnesses, failed to\r\ndefend them against the superior arms of their pitiless enemy. Defeated\r\nin every encounter, driven from every stronghold, thousands perished by\r\nfamine or the sword, and those who submitted were either condemned to a\r\ncruel death or exiled from their native soil. Many were driven to seek a\r\nrefuge in the caves of the Alpujarras, south-east of Granada, and of the\r\nbold sierras that stretch along the southern shores of Spain. Their\r\npursuers followed up the chase with the fierce glee of the hunter\r\ntracking the wild beast of the forest to his lair. There they were\r\nhuddled together, one or two hundred frequently in the same cavern. It\r\nwas not easy to detect the hiding-place amidst the rocks and thickets\r\nwhich covered up and concealed the entrance. But when it was detected,\r\nit was no difficult matter to destroy the inmates. The green bushes\r\nfurnished the material for a smouldering fire, and those within were\r\nsoon suffocated by the smoke, or, rushing out, threw themselves on the\r\nmercy of their pursuers. Some were butchered on the spot; others were\r\nsent to the gibbet or the galleys; while the greater part, with a fate\r\nscarcely less terrible, were given up as the booty of the soldiers, and\r\nsold into slavery.\r\n\r\nAben Aboo, the last chief of the insurgents, who had hitherto eluded\r\nevery attempt to seize him, but whose capture was of more importance\r\nthan that of any other of his nation, had a narrow escape in one of\r\nthese caverns not far from Berchal, where he lay hid with a wife and two\r\nof his daughters. The women were suffocated, with about seventy other\r\npersons; but the Morisco chief succeeded in making his escape through an\r\naperture at the further end, which was unknown to his enemies.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the little king of the Alpujarras, as he was\r\ncontemptuously called by the Spaniards, was soon after killed in another\r\ncavern by a traitor’s hand, and with him fell the last hope of the\r\nMoriscos. His corpse, set astride on a mule, and supported erect in the\r\nsaddle by a wooden frame, concealed beneath ample robes, was led in\r\ntriumphal procession through the streets of Granada, and then\r\ndecapitated. The body was given to the rabble, who, after dragging it\r\nthrough the streets with scoffs and imprecations, committed it to the\r\nflames, while the head, inclosed in a cage, was set up over the gate\r\nwhich opened on the Alpujarras. There it remained for many a year, no\r\none venturing to remove it, for on the cage was inscribed, ‘This is the\r\nhead of the traitor Aben Aboo. Let no one take it down, under pain of\r\ndeath.’\r\n\r\nThe neighbourhood of Gortyna, in the island of Crete, has become\r\ncelebrated in modern times for a mountain-labyrinth, with numerous and\r\nintricate passages, which exists in a valley near it, and in which the\r\nmyth of the Dædalean labyrinth was probably localised. During the\r\nrevolutionary war against the Turkish yoke (1822–1828) the Christian\r\ninhabitants of the adjacent villages, for months together, lived in this\r\ncavern, merely sallying out by day to till their lands, or to gather\r\ntheir crops, when it was safe to do so. Though the dark recesses of the\r\ncavern were not very inviting abodes for human beings for any long\r\nperiod, yet the sense of safety gave it, doubtless, a peculiar charm;\r\nfor no one could approach within range of the numerous muskets pointed\r\nfrom masked loopholes at its entrance, without being immediately shot\r\ndown; nor could either fire or smoke suffocate or dislodge its inmates,\r\nas the entrance is in the side of a steep hill, 500 or 600 feet above\r\nthe bed of the wild valley in which it is situated, and thus is safe\r\nfrom attack in every direction. History as well as tradition states\r\nthat, in all troubled times in Crete, the labyrinth of Gortyna has been\r\nthe retreat of the inhabitants of the neighbourhood; but when Captain\r\nSpratt visited it in 1852, its only inhabitants were bats, who, by their\r\nmode of hooking on to each other, were hanging from the ceiling like\r\nclusters of bees. Under good native guides, he spent nearly two hours in\r\nthreading its tortuous passages, which turn in so many ways and have so\r\nmany branches as to justify the conclusion that a master hand must have\r\ndirected the excavation. The mark of the tool is seen upon every side of\r\nthe avenues and chambers, indicative of its artificial character.\r\n\r\nLess fortunate than their brethren of Gortyna were the unfortunate\r\nCretans who, during the same war, took refuge in the cave of Melidoni.\r\nIn 1822, when Hussein Bey marched against the neighbouring village, the\r\ninhabitants, to the number of three hundred, repaired to the cave,\r\ntaking with them their valuables and provisions sufficient for six\r\nmonths. The entrance is so narrow and steep that they were perfectly\r\nsecured against an attack, and the Turks in their first attempt lost\r\ntwenty-five men. Finding that they refused submission on any terms,\r\nHussein Bey ordered a quantity of combustibles to be brought to the\r\nentrance and set on fire. The smoke, rolling into the cavern in immense\r\nvolumes, drove the miserable fugitives into the remoter chambers, where\r\nthey lingered a little while longer, but were all eventually suffocated.\r\nThe Turks waited some days, but still did not dare to enter, and a Greek\r\ncaptive was finally sent down on the promise of his life being spared.\r\nThe Turks then descended and plundered the bodies. A week afterwards,\r\nthree natives of the village stole into the cavern to see what had\r\nbecome of their friends and relatives. It is said that they were so\r\novercome by the terrible spectacle that two of them died within a few\r\ndays. Years afterwards, when the last vestiges of the insurrection had\r\nbeen suppressed, the Archbishop of Crete blessed the cavern, making it\r\nconsecrated ground; and the bones of the victims were gathered together\r\nand partially covered up, in the outer chamber—a vast elliptical hall,\r\nabout eighty feet in height, and propped in the centre by an enormous\r\nstalactitic pillar. On all sides the stalactites hang like fluted\r\ncurtains from the roof, here in broad sheeted masses, there dropping\r\ninto single sharp folds, but all on a scale of Titanic grandeur. In this\r\nimposing and silent hall, under the black banners of eternal Night, lay\r\nheaped the mouldering skulls and bones of the poor Christians. They\r\ncould not have had a more appropriate sepulchre.\r\n\r\nSuch have been the atrocities of Turkish warfare within the memory of\r\nliving man; but French officers have in our days emulated the cruelty of\r\nOttoman commanders, and shown that the nation which boasts of marching\r\nat the head of civilisation has still retained much of its ancient\r\nGallic barbarism. When Marshal Pelissier filled with smoke the crowded\r\ncaves of the Dahra in 1844, and destroyed many hundreds of Kabyls whose\r\ngreat crime it was to defend their country against the French hordes, it\r\nhas been stated, as an excuse for this atrocity, that he left open some\r\nof the entrances to the caves, and that he only resorted to the smoke as\r\na means of compelling the fugitives to come out and surrender; but no\r\nsuch excuse can be pleaded in favour of his successor, St. Arnaud. In\r\nthe summer of 1845,[23] this French commander received private\r\ninformation that a body of Arabs had taken refuge in the cave of Shelas.\r\nThither he marched a body of troops. Eleven of the fugitives came out\r\nand surrendered; but it was known to St. Arnaud, though not to any other\r\nFrenchman, that five hundred men remained in the cave. All these people\r\nColonel St. Arnaud determined to kill, and at the same time to keep the\r\ndeed secret even from the troops engaged in the operation, as the\r\nsmoking of the Caves of the Dahra had not greatly tended to raise France\r\nin the public opinion of Europe. Except his brother and Marshal Bugeaud,\r\nwhose approval was the prize he sought, no one was to know what he did.\r\nHe contrived to execute both his purposes. Thus he writes to his\r\nbrother:—‘I had all the apertures hermetically stopped up. I made one\r\nvast sepulchre. No one went into the caverns; no one but myself knew\r\nthat under these there are 500 brigands who will never again slaughter\r\nFrenchmen. A confidential report has told all to the marshal, without\r\nterrible poetry or imagery. Brother, no one is so good as I am by taste\r\nand by nature. From the 8th to the 12th I have been ill, but my\r\nconscience does not reproach me. I have done my duty as a commander, and\r\nto-morrow I would do the same over again; but I have taken a disgust to\r\nAfrica.’ With such nauseous sentiment wrote the man, ‘_good_ by taste\r\nand nature,’ who seven years later was to attach the memory of his name\r\nto the bloody days of December, and to deal with many a French\r\nrepublican as he had dealt with the Arabs.\r\n\r\nFootnote 23:\r\n\r\n  Kinglake.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XVI.\r\n                HERMIT CAVES—ROCK TEMPLES—ROCK CHURCHES.\r\n\r\nSt. Paul of Thebes—St. Anthony—His Visit to Alexandria, and death—\r\n  Numerous Cave Hermits in the East—St. Benedict in the Cave of Subiaco—\r\n  St. Cuthbert—St. Beatus—Rock Temples of Kanara—The Wonders of Ellora—\r\n  Ipsamboul—Rock Churches of Lalibala in Abyssinia—The Cave of\r\n  Trophonios—The Grotto of St. Rosolia near Palermo—The Chapel of Agios\r\n  Niketas in Greece—The Chapel of Oberstein on the Nahe—The repentant\r\n  fratricide.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe dim twilight of a forest, its leafy vaults, its majestic silence, or\r\nits foliage moaning in the wind, are all apt to strike the mind with a\r\nreligious awe. But the solitude and stillness of caverns is equally well\r\nadapted to awaken feelings of devotion, and thus we find that\r\ncontemplative minds in every age, and of every creed, have found in them\r\ncongenial retreats. The Indian fakir and the Mahometan dervish love the\r\nseclusion of the silent grotto, and here also the Hebrew prophets not\r\nseldom enjoyed their ecstatic visions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INDIAN ROCK-CUT TEMPLE: PORCH OF THE CHAITYA CAVE TEMPLE,\r\nAJUNTA.]\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that, during the first ages of Christianity many\r\nan unknown anchorite retired to some solitary cave, as to a harbour of\r\nrefuge from the rude contact of the world; but the first hermit\r\nmentioned in ecclesiastical history is St. Paul of Thebes, in Egypt,\r\nwho, during the persecution of Decius, in the middle of the third\r\ncentury, retreated to the desert, where, dwelling in a cave, and living\r\non the fruits of trees, he reached his hundredth year. His friend and\r\ndisciple, St. Anthony, who first roused among his contemporaries a wide-\r\nspread inclination for hermit seclusion, plays a far more conspicuous\r\npart in the annals of the Church. Born of wealthy Coptic peasants, this\r\nremarkable man, at the age of twenty, divided his whole property among\r\nthe poor, and thenceforth devoted himself to a life of the strictest\r\nascetism. He retired first to a rock-cave in the neighbourhood of his\r\nnative village, and then to the more distant ruins of a deserted castle,\r\nwhere he spent twenty years as a hermit. Meanwhile his reputation for\r\nsanctity had spread throughout all Egypt, and numerous candidates for a\r\nhermit life besought him to take them under his spiritual care. He\r\nyielded to their entreaties, and soon the neighbouring desert was\r\ncrowded with the huts of zealous anchorites, who revered him as their\r\nmodel. But he was surrounded not only by these pious disciples; the\r\nworldly-minded also came flocking to his cave for advice or assistance;\r\nfor the belief was general that, like the first Apostles, he was gifted\r\nwith the power of casting out devils and foretelling future events.\r\nAnthony, thus disturbed in his solitary meditations, resolved to bury\r\nhimself still deeper in the desert, and fled to a cave in the furthest\r\nparts of Egypt, near a source shaded by a few date-palms. Here he hoped\r\nto be able to live entirely for prayer and contemplation, but his hopes\r\nproved vain, for, after a long search, his disciples discovered his\r\nretreat, and again anchorites and worldlings broke in upon his solitude.\r\nIn his hundredth year he was prevailed upon by St. Athanasius to visit\r\nAlexandria, where, whenever he appeared, crowds gathered round him to\r\nkiss the hem of his garment and to implore his blessing. Even the\r\nEmperor Constantine the Great wrote to him; yet so indifferent had he\r\nbecome to all worldly distinctions that he could with difficulty be\r\nprevailed upon to have the letter read to him. Thus, honoured by high\r\nand low, and yet avoiding all honour, Anthony reached the patriarchal\r\nage of 105. At the approach of death he begged two of his most beloved\r\ndisciples to conduct him to the wildest part of the desert. Here he died\r\nin their arms, after having first made them promise to keep the place of\r\nhis burial secret, as he feared that an undue reverence might be paid to\r\nhis bones.\r\n\r\nAnthony’s example was followed far and wide over the eastern world.\r\nWhole colonies of hermits settled in the desert of Thebes, near Lake\r\nMoeris, in Southern Palestine, in Armenia, and Pontus. Their numbers\r\namounted to thousands, many living in rude huts, which they erected with\r\ntheir own hands, while others found a congenial retreat in the grottoes\r\nand rock-tombs which abound in many of the countries where they dwelt.\r\n\r\nFrom the East the spirit of monastic seclusion soon spread to Western\r\nEurope. St. Benedict, the founder of the order which has rendered such\r\nsignal service to learning during the Middle Ages, spent three years in\r\nan inaccessible cave near Subiaco, five leagues from Tivoli. Romanus, a\r\nmonk in a neighbouring convent, alone knew of his retreat, and daily let\r\ndown by a rope, from the top of the rock in which the cave was situated,\r\nthe small quantity of bread which he needed for his subsistence. Here he\r\nwas at length discovered by some shepherds, who at first sight took him\r\nfor a wild beast, as he was clothed in skins, but soon discovered that\r\nhe was a saint by the wise lessons he gave them.\r\n\r\nA similar longing for a life of pious seclusion induced St. Cuthbert to\r\nquit the Convent of Lindisfarne, of which he had been prior, and to seek\r\na retreat in a grotto excavated by his own hands, on one of the Farne\r\nIslands, on the coast of Northumberland. An ox-hide, which he hung\r\nbefore its entrance and turned towards the side whence the wind blew,\r\nafforded a scanty shelter against the rigours of a northern winter. But\r\nthe fame of his sanctity spread over all England, and numerous pilgrims\r\nresorted to his cave, to profit by his advice, or to seek consolation in\r\ntheir troubles. One day, when he had spent eight years in seclusion, the\r\nking of Northumbria, attended by his principal nobles, landed on\r\nCuthbert’s island-rock to beg him to accept the episcopal dignity of\r\nDurham, to which he had been elected. The holy anchorite yielded, with\r\nmany tears, and after an obstinate resistance, for he was loth to accept\r\nduties which tore him from his solitude. After two years he resigned his\r\nbishopric, and returned to his beloved cave, where he shortly after\r\ndied. According to a popular legend the Entrochi, or calcareous joints\r\nof the petrified Lily-Encrinites, which are found among the rocks of the\r\nFarne Islands, are forged by his spirit, and pass there by the name of\r\n‘St. Cuthbert’s beads.’ While at this task, he is supposed to sit during\r\nthe night upon a certain rock, and to use another as his anvil.\r\n\r\n               ‘Such tales had Whitby’s fishers told,\r\n               And said they might his shape behold,\r\n                 And hear his anvil sound;\r\n               A deadened clang—a huge dim form,\r\n               Seen but, and heard, when gathering storm\r\n                 And night was closing round.’—_Marmion._\r\n\r\nThe Beatenberg, situated on the northern side of the lake of Thun, is\r\nnamed after a celebrated cave in which St. Beatus, originally a British\r\nnoble, who had come to preach the Gospel to the wild men of the\r\ndistrict, dwelt for many years, and died at the advanced age of ninety.\r\nHis relics remaining there, his fête-day attracted such crowds of\r\npilgrims that reforming Berne sent two deputies in 1528 to carry off the\r\nsaint’s skull and bury it between the lakes of Thun and Brienz; but\r\nstill the pilgrimages continued, and at length, in 1566, the Protestant\r\nzeal of Berne went to the expense of a wall, and thus effectually shut\r\nout the pilgrims, who, in more modern times, have been profitably\r\nreplaced by crowds of tourists.\r\n\r\nBoth in the heathen and the Christian world, grottoes, particularly such\r\nas had been hallowed by the lives of sainted anchorites, have frequently\r\nbeen consecrated to divine service; and to render them still more worthy\r\nof their destination, the rude excavations of nature have not seldom\r\nbeen enlarged and beautified with all the resources of art.\r\n\r\nAmong these subterranean places of worship, those of India are\r\ndeservedly renowned for their colossal size, and for the vast labour\r\nbestowed upon the sculptures with which they are adorned. A description\r\nof the famous rock-temples of Kanara, in the island of Salsette, near\r\nBombay, will give the reader some idea of their magnificence.\r\n\r\nThe way leads over a narrow mountain-path, through a jungle so dense\r\nthat the traveller is obliged to quit his palanquin, and to ascend on\r\nfoot the steep acclivity, from which, at some distance from the summit,\r\nthe large temple overlooks the country. This colossal work is hewn out\r\nof the solid rock, ninety feet long and thirty-eight feet broad, with a\r\ncorresponding height, and forms an oblong square with a vaulted roof.\r\nTwo colossal rows of columns divide the hall into three naves or\r\navenues, and give it the form of an ancient basilica.\r\n\r\nAs the Temple of Kanara served the Portuguese for some time as a church,\r\nduring their occupation of the small archipelago of Bombay, the heathen\r\nsculptures which decorated the interior have naturally been mostly\r\ndestroyed. This is the more to be regretted as the well-preserved and\r\nmasterly-executed capitals of the mighty columns justify the belief that\r\ntheir artistic merit must have been worthy of the grand dimensions of\r\nthe hall. The beautiful portico, however, is still richly decorated. On\r\neach side a recess contains a colossal, well-executed statue, and long\r\ninscriptions in unknown characters are carved on the square pillars of\r\nthe entrance. The charms of a mysterious past thus add to the interest\r\nof this beautiful monument, the work of an astonishing patience and\r\nperseverance. The outer face of the portico, as well as the vestibule\r\nextending before it, twenty-eight feet deep, have been considerably\r\ninjured by the ravages of time: many stones have started from their\r\njoints, and a multitude of creeping plants cling to the mouldering\r\nstatues. Thus the efforts of man to rear eternal monuments are vain;\r\nthey must necessarily yield to the living powers of nature.\r\n\r\n            ‘The cloud-capped towers, the gorgeous palaces,\r\n            The solemn temples, the great globe itself,\r\n            Yea, all which it inherit, shall dissolve,\r\n            And, like this unsubstantial pageant faded,\r\n            Leave not a rack behind.’[24]\r\n\r\nFootnote 24:\r\n\r\n  Shakespeare, ‘Tempest,’ iv. 1.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROCK-TEMPLES OF AJUNTA.]\r\n\r\nSteps are hewn in the rock to the summit of the mountain, and various\r\nintricate paths lead to smaller excavations, consisting mostly of two\r\ncells and a portico. Near each of them is a well or basin, likewise hewn\r\nout of the rock, in which the rain-water collects, affording a grateful\r\nbeverage to the tired wanderer. Many of these caves are larger and more\r\nperfect than the others, and some in their general effect resemble the\r\ngreat temple, although far inferior in size and decoration.\r\n\r\nThe whole aspect of this perforated mountain shows that a complete cave-\r\ntown, capable of containing several thousand inhabitants, has been\r\nhollowed out in its flanks. The largest excavation was, beyond a doubt,\r\nthe chief temple. The smaller caves, arranged according to the same\r\nplan, likewise served for devotional purposes; and the rest were\r\ndwellings more or less commodious and large according to the rank or\r\nmeans of their possessors, or, what is still more likely, the abode of\r\npious Brahmans and their scholars at the time when India was the cradle\r\nof arts and sciences, while the nations of Europe were still plunged in\r\nbarbarism.\r\n\r\nFrom the summit of this wonderful mountain the spectator enjoys a\r\nbeautiful prospect. The island of Salsette lies before him as if spread\r\nout on a map, affording a most agreeable variety of rice-fields and\r\ncocoa-nut groves, of villages and meadows, of woody hills and fruitful\r\nvales. The surrounding mountains form a foreground of grey rocks, dotted\r\nwith trees, or excavated into dark grottoes, once the abode of fakirs,\r\nbut now the retreats of tigers, snakes, huge bats, and enormous swarms\r\nof bees, while towards the south the horizon is bounded by the island of\r\nBombay, with its forest of masts, towards the east by the mainland,\r\ntowards the north by Bassein and the neighbouring mountains, and towards\r\nthe south by the ocean. The enjoyment of the picturesque scene is marred\r\nonly by the many tigers which infest the mountains, and frequently\r\ndescend into the plain, where they not only carry away sheep and oxen,\r\nbut also tear many a poor Hindoo to pieces.\r\n\r\nThe rock-temples of Kanara are rivalled by those of Elephanta, Karli,\r\nand Ajunta, and far surpassed in magnificence and extent by the\r\nexcavations of Ellora, near the town and fort of Dowlatabad, where a\r\nwhole mountain of hard red granite has been hollowed out into an immense\r\nrange of highly ornamented grottoes and temples, fit for the residence\r\nof a whole pantheon of deities, and for the reception of a whole nation\r\nof pilgrims.\r\n\r\nAbout three miles to the north of Madras, where the rock touches the\r\nsea, navigators had long remarked some pillars of stone rising from the\r\nwater and covered with rude sculptures. From these the spot received the\r\nname of the Seven Pagodas. Most of them have since been destroyed by the\r\ntides, and one only is still standing, though tottering to its fall.\r\nThese, however, were but the advanced posts of the colossal excavations\r\nin the rocky wall behind; for here also are seen large grottoes,\r\nporticoes, and temples, as at Ellora, though of somewhat smaller\r\nproportions, and of less beautiful execution. They are dedicated to the\r\nworship of Vishnu and Siva, and covered with inscriptions. A whole rock-\r\ntown, or at least a vast sanctuary, thus lies concealed on this solitary\r\ncoast.\r\n\r\nSimilar cave-temples are met with in Cochin China, Birmah, Malwah, and\r\nCeylon, where the spacious rock-temple of Dambool is deservedly\r\ncelebrated for its antiquity, and for its numerous statues of Buddha, in\r\nthe varied attitudes of exhortation and repose.\r\n\r\nOn the banks of the mysterious Nile we find rock-temples rivalling those\r\nof India in colossal grandeur, and among these Ipsamboul is pre-eminent\r\nin splendour.\r\n\r\n‘After sailing for some hours,’ says Warburton,[25] ‘through a country\r\nquite level on the eastern bank, we come upon a precipitous rocky\r\nmountain, starting up so suddenly from the river’s edge, that its very\r\nsummits are reflected in the water. We moored under a sand-bank, and,\r\naccompanied by half-a-dozen of the crew with torches, approached this\r\nisolated and stupendous rock. Yet even here the daring genius of\r\nEthiopian architecture ventured to enter into rivalry with Nature’s\r\ngreatness, and found her material in the very mountains that seemed to\r\nbid defiance to her efforts.\r\n\r\nFootnote 25:\r\n\r\n  ‘The Crescent and the Cross.’\r\n\r\n‘On the face of the vertical cliff a recess is excavated to the extent\r\nof about a hundred feet in width. From this four gigantic figures stand\r\nout in very bold relief. Between the two central stony giants, a lofty\r\ndoorway opens into a vast hall, supported by square pillars, each the\r\nsize of a tower, and covered with hieroglyphics. Just enough painting\r\nstill glimmers faintly on these columns to show that they were formerly\r\ncovered with it; and the walls are carved into historic figures in\r\nslight relief; these, as our torches threw an uncertain glare over them,\r\nseemed to move and become instinct with life.\r\n\r\n‘This temple was dedicated to Athor, the lady of Aboccis (the ancient\r\nname of Ipsamboul), who is represented within under the form of the\r\nsacred bow. This was, however, a mere “chapel of ease” to the great\r\ntemple, excavated from a loftier rock, about fifty yards distant.\r\nBetween these two a deep gorge once ran to the river, but this is now\r\nchoked up with sand, in whose burning waves we waded knee-deep to the\r\nTemple of Osiris.\r\n\r\n‘Here a space of about 100 feet in height is hewn from the mountain;\r\nsmooth, except for the reliefs. Along the summit runs a frieze of little\r\nmonkeys in long array, as if the architect felt the absurdity of the\r\nwhole business, or as Byron sometimes finishes off a sublime sentence\r\nwith a scoff. Then succeeds a line of hieroglyphics and some faintly-\r\ncarved figures, also in relief, and then four colossal giants that seem\r\nto guard the portal. They are seated on thrones (which form, with\r\nthemselves, part of the living rock), and are about sixty feet high. One\r\nis quite perfect, admirably cut, and the proportions admirably\r\npreserved; the second is defaced as far as the knee; the third is buried\r\nin sand to the waist; and the fourth has only the face and neck visible\r\nabove the desert’s sandy avalanche.\r\n\r\n‘The doorway stands between the two central statues, and is surmounted\r\nby the statue of Isis wearing the moon as a turban.\r\n\r\n‘On entering, the traveller finds himself in a temple, which a few days’\r\nwork might restore to the state in which it was left, just finished,\r\nthree thousand years ago. The dry climate and its extreme solitude have\r\npreserved its most delicate details from injury; besides which it was\r\nhermetically sealed by the desert for thousands of years, until\r\nBurckhardt discovered it, and Mr. Hay cleared away its protecting sands.\r\n\r\n‘A vast and gloomy hall, such as Eblis might have given Vathek audience\r\nin, receives you in passing from the flaming sunshine into that shadowy\r\nportal. It is some time before the eye can ascertain its dimensions\r\nthrough the imposing gloom, but gradually there reveals itself, around\r\nand above you, a vast aisle, with pillars formed of eight colossal\r\ngiants, upon whom the light of heaven has never shone. These images of\r\nOsiris are backed by enormous pillars, behind which run two great\r\ngalleries; and in these torchlight alone enabled us to peruse a series\r\nof sculptures in relief representing the triumphs of Rameses the Second,\r\nor Sesostris. The painting, which once enhanced the effect of these\r\nspirited representations, is not dimmed, but crumbled away; where it\r\nexists the colours are as vivid as ever.\r\n\r\n‘This unequalled hall is one hundred feet in length, and from it eight\r\nlesser chambers, all sculptured, open to the right and left. Straight on\r\nis a low doorway opening into a second hall of similar height, supported\r\nby four square pillars, and within all is the adytum, wherein stands a\r\nsimple altar of the living rock in front of four large figures seated on\r\nrocky thrones. This inner shrine is hewn at least one hundred yards into\r\nthe rock, and here, in the silent depth of that great mountain, these\r\nawful idols, with their mysterious altar of human sacrifice, looked very\r\npreadamitic and imposing. They seemed to sit there waiting for some\r\ngreat summons which should awaken and reanimate these “kings of the\r\nearth, who lie in glory, every one in his own house.”\r\n\r\n‘We wandered through many chambers, in which the air is so calm and\r\nundisturbed that the very smell of the torches of the last explorers of\r\nthese caverns was perceptible.’\r\n\r\nIn Abyssinia the rock-churches of Lalibala likewise give proof of an\r\nancient state of civilisation, strongly contrasting with the barbarism\r\nof the present times.\r\n\r\nLike the temples of Ellora, some of these curious structures have been\r\nhollowed out of single blocks of stone left standing in the centre of\r\nopen courts excavated in the bosom of the rock, while others are\r\ncompletely subterranean. Though far inferior in magnificence and extent\r\nto those wonderful edifices, they are yet very remarkable. The courts,\r\nin which the three principal monolithic churches are respectively\r\ndedicated to our Saviour, to the Holy Virgin, and to St. Emmanuel,\r\ncommunicate with each other by narrow passages, the whole thus forming a\r\ncontinued series of excavations. The Church of St. Emmanuel is forty-\r\neight feet long, thirty-two feet broad, and forty feet high, but it is\r\nsurpassed in size by the Church of the Holy Virgin, where the rock-walls\r\nof the court are moreover perforated with sepulchral vaults and with\r\ncells for the habitation of monks. The town of Lalibala is situated in a\r\nbeautiful country, 7,000 feet above the level of the sea, on the slope\r\nof the mighty Ascheten mountain, and commands a prospect of Alpine\r\nmagnificence. Though it is now reduced to about 2,000 inhabitants, its\r\neight rock-churches (five monolithic and subaërial, three subterranean),\r\nprove that it must once have been a place of considerable importance.\r\nDivine service is still performed in all these churches, which are the\r\nresort of numerous pilgrims, and to whose service above 500 priests,\r\nmonks, and nuns are attached.\r\n\r\nThough ancient Greece has no such huge rock-temples to boast of as India\r\nor Egypt, yet caverns played an important part in her ancient religious\r\nhistory. ‘Before the old tribes of Hellas erected temples to the\r\ndivinities,’ says Porphyry, in his treatise _De Antro Nympharum_, ‘they\r\nconsecrated caves and grottoes to their service; in the island of Crete\r\nto Zeus, in Arcadia to Artemis and to Pan; in the isle of Naxos to\r\nDionysos.’\r\n\r\nCaves were the site of some of the most celebrated Grecian oracles. The\r\ntripod of the Delphian pythoness stood over a subterranean hollow, from\r\nwhich the divine inspiration was supposed to ascend; and pilgrims from\r\nall parts of Hellas resorted to a cave in the neighbourhood of Lebadeia,\r\na city of Bœotia, and named after Trophonios, a mythical personage who\r\nwas supposed to have lived there for many years, and was subsequently\r\ndeified as an oracular god. Those who repaired to this cave for\r\ninformation were required, after passing some preparatory days in a\r\nchapel dedicated to Fortune and to the ‘good genius,’ to anoint\r\nthemselves with oil, to bathe in a certain river, and to drink of the\r\nwater of two neighbouring springs called Lêthê and Mnêmosynê, the first\r\nof which made them forgetful of the past, while the second fixed in\r\ntheir memory all they heard and saw in the cavern. They were then\r\nclothed in a linen robe, took a honeyed cake in their hands, and, after\r\npraying before an ancient statue of Trophonios, descended into the\r\nsubterranean chamber by a narrow passage. Here it was that the future\r\nwas unfolded to them, either by visions or extraordinary sounds. The\r\nreturn from the cave was by the same passage, but the persons consulting\r\nwere obliged to walk backwards. They generally came out astonished,\r\nmelancholy, and dejected. The priests on their return placed them on an\r\nelevated seat, called the seat of Mnêmosynê or remembrance, and the\r\nbroken sentences they uttered in their confused state of mind were\r\nconsidered as the answer of the oracle. They were then conducted to the\r\nchapel of the ‘good genius,’ where by degrees they recovered their usual\r\ncomposure and cheerfulness. There can be no doubt that the priests\r\nintroduced themselves into the cave by secret passages, and worked upon\r\nthe excited imagination of their dupes by terrible sounds and\r\napparitions. During the palmy days of the oracle, the neighbourhood of\r\nthe Cave of Trophonios was decorated with temples and statues; at\r\npresent its very site is uncertain.\r\n\r\nLike ancient paganism, Christianity not seldom celebrates her rites in\r\ncaves hallowed by the memory of saints and anchorites. A stately church\r\nrises over the Grotto of the Nativity, at Bethlehem, and a magnificent\r\npile has been constructed at Jerusalem over the rock-tomb in which our\r\nSaviour was buried. The grotto on Mount Carmel, to which the prophet\r\nElijah retreated from the world, is now dedicated to divine worship, in\r\nthe convent which bears his name; and the cave in which John the\r\nEvangelist is said to have written the Apocalypse during his exile in\r\nthe island of Patmos has also been converted into a chapel.\r\n\r\nOne of the most celebrated rock-churches is the grotto of St. Rosolia,\r\nthe patroness of Palermo. This illustrious lady was niece to King\r\nWilliam the Good, and, as the legends inform us, no less remarkable for\r\nher beauty than for her virtues, which made her the admiration of all\r\nSicily. Never was a princess more fitted to adorn society; but the world\r\nhad so few attractions for a spirit that could only breathe in the pure\r\nregions of piety, that, at the age of fifteen, she retired to the\r\nsolitary mountains, and, from the date of her disappearance, in 1159,\r\nwas never more heard of for about five hundred years. The people thought\r\nshe had been taken up to heaven, as the fitting abode for her more than\r\nhuman perfections; but in the year 1624, during the time of a dreadful\r\nplague, a holy man had a vision that the saint’s bones were lying in a\r\ncave near to the top of the Monte Pellegrino, and that if these were\r\ntaken up with due reverence and carried in procession thrice round the\r\nwalls of the city, they should immediately be delivered from the\r\nscourge. The bones were accordingly sought and found, thrice carried\r\nround the town, as the vision had described, and the plague suddenly\r\nceased. From that time St. Rosolia was revered as the patron saint of\r\nPalermo, and the remote cave where she probably spent many years of her\r\nsolitary life, became one of the most renowned sanctuaries of the\r\nCatholic Church, and the resort of innumerable pilgrims. The mountain is\r\nextremely high, and so steep that before the discovery of St. Rosolia it\r\nwas looked upon as almost inaccessible; but a fine road, very properly\r\ntermed La Scala, or the stair, has been cut out in the rock, and leads\r\nfrom terrace to terrace, over almost perpendicular precipices, to the\r\nentrance of the holy grotto, which is situated near the very top of the\r\nmountain, and commands a magnificent prospect. Within two miles of the\r\nfoot of the mountain, the eye discerns the city of Palermo, with its\r\nbeautiful villas and luxuriant gardens, and then, taking a wider range,\r\nglances to the north, over the dark blue sea bounded by the Lipari\r\nIslands and the ever-fuming cone of Stromboli; while to the east a large\r\nportion of Etna, although at the distance of almost the whole length of\r\nSicily, towers like a giant above the minor mountain chains. A church\r\nand other buildings, forming a kind of court yard, where some priests\r\nreside, appointed to watch over the treasures of the place, and to\r\nreceive the offerings of pilgrims that visit them, have been erected\r\nround the grotto.\r\n\r\nAs may easily be imagined, the history of rock-chapels has frequently\r\nbeen embellished with legendary tales. The chapel of Agios Niketas (St.\r\nNicholas) in Crete, is at present merely a smoky-looking cave beneath a\r\nlarge detached mass of rock, lying on the slope of an abrupt mountain;\r\nbut there are still the remains of a building which once extended far\r\nbeyond the present limits. The roof of the cavern, although very uneven,\r\nis also elaborately ornamented with paintings, representing the\r\nremarkable events in the life of the Saviour and of St. Nicholas, and\r\nshowing that considerable cost and artistic care have been bestowed upon\r\nit. Though it is now abandoned, an event that is said to have happened\r\nabout four or five centuries ago gives this cave a special interest with\r\nthe natives. The church was crowded with Christians from the adjacent\r\nvillages on the eve of the festival of their patron saint Agios Niketas,\r\nso as to be ready (as is usual with the Greeks) for the matin service at\r\ndaybreak. But the fires which the assembled party had lighted near it\r\nhad been observed at sea by a Barbary corsair then cruising off the\r\nisland, and guided him to the spot, where, under the darkness of the\r\nnight, he landed his crew in a neighbouring cove. Thus unobserved, they\r\nstole up to the church, and, finding it full of the natives, closed the\r\ndoor and windows upon them, and waited for day, the better to secure\r\ntheir captives for embarkation. In this dreadful plight the unfortunate\r\nCretans raised their voices in a general prayer to Saint Niketas. Their\r\nsupplications were heard, for the priest soon after informed them that\r\nthe saint had shown him a way of escape—through the back part of the\r\ncavern, by opening a small aperture communicating with another cavern\r\nthat led finally out upon the mountain slope over the rock. Through this\r\naperture they all silently crept unseen and unheard by the corsairs.\r\n\r\nAnother interesting legend is attached to a small rock-chapel situated\r\nbeneath the ruins of the ancient Castle of Oberstein, on the Nahe. The\r\nBaron of Oberstein, having, in a fit of jealousy, hurled his younger\r\nbrother from the balcony of the castle, fled from the scene of his\r\ncrime. For years he wandered, a wretched outcast, from land to land; but\r\nwherever he went the curse of Cain was upon him, and left him no rest by\r\nnight or day. At length he came to Rome, to confess his fratricide at\r\nthe feet of the Sovereign Pontiff, who comforted him with the assurance\r\nthat he would recover his lost peace by returning to Oberstein and\r\nexcavating with his own hands a rock-chapel for the interment of his\r\nbrother on the spot where he fell.\r\n\r\nSoon after the self-banished lord made his appearance at Oberstein in a\r\nhermit’s garb, and set to work upon the hard rock with indefatigable\r\nzeal. Never was labour performed with better will, and such,\r\nconsequently, was the progress of the excavation that it seemed as if he\r\nwere assisted by the angels in his penitential task. At the expiration\r\nof four years, the rock-chapel was completed, and the bones of the\r\nmurdered man were conveyed with great ceremony to the tomb which had\r\nbeen prepared for their reception at the foot of the altar. As soon as\r\nthey were lowered into the grave, the murderer bent over them; a smile\r\nof ineffable happiness was seen to illumine his emaciated features, and\r\nhe dropped down dead upon the remains of his brother.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XVII.\r\n                       ICE-CAVES AND WIND-HOLES.\r\n\r\nIce-caves of St. Georges and St. Livres—Beautiful Ice-stalagmites in the\r\n  Cave of La Baume—The Schafloch—Ice Cataract in the Upper Glacière of\r\n  St. Livres—Ice Cavern of Eisenerz—The Cave of Yeermalik—Volcanic Ice-\r\n  caves—Æolian Caverns of Terni—Causes of the low temperature of Ice-\r\n  caves.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome caves, remarkable for an extremely low temperature even in summer,\r\nform natural ice-cellars, though unconnected with glaciers or snow\r\nmountains, and in latitudes and at altitudes where ice could not under\r\nordinary circumstances be supposed to exist. Besides the interest\r\nattaching to these natural curiosities, these ice-caves are sometimes\r\nlucrative sources of revenue to their owners, or answer various purposes\r\nof use or comfort.\r\n\r\nIn hot summers, when the supplies of the artificial ice-houses fail in\r\nGeneva and Lausanne, the hotel-keepers have recourse to the stores laid\r\nup for them by nature in the ice-caves or glacières of St. Georges and\r\nSt. Livres, situated in the canton of Vaud, on the slope of the Jura.\r\nOther ice-caves are made use of as dairies, or as storehouses for\r\ncheese; and the quarries of Niedermendig, near the small town of\r\nAndernach, on the Rhine, which are likewise remarkable for a glacial\r\ntemperature, serve as excellent beer-cellars.\r\n\r\nTo Mr. Browne, who has made them his special study, we are indebted for\r\nan interesting account of the ice-caves of France and Switzerland,[26]\r\nwhich, as may naturally be expected in halls and galleries hung with\r\ndrapery of transparent silver, not seldom offer scenes of beauty\r\nrivalling the most renowned stalactital grottoes.\r\n\r\nFootnote 26:\r\n\r\n  ‘Ice Caves of France and Switzerland: a Narrative of Subterranean\r\n  Exploration.’ By the Rev. G. F. Browne. Longmans, 1865.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LOWER GLACIÈRE OF ST. LIVRES.]\r\n\r\nIn the Glacière of Grâce-Dieu, or La Baume, near Besançon, Mr. Browne\r\nwas particularly struck with three large stalagmites of ice rising in a\r\nline across the middle of the cave. The central mass was remarkable only\r\nfor its size, the girth being sixty-six and a half feet at some distance\r\nfrom the ice-floor, with which it blended; but nothing could be more\r\nstrikingly lovely than the stalagmite to its right, owing to the good\r\ntaste of some one, who had found that much ice was wont to accumulate on\r\nthat spot, and had accordingly fixed the trunk of a small fir-tree, with\r\nthe upper branches complete, to receive the water from the corresponding\r\nfissure in the roof. The consequence was that, while the actual tree had\r\nvanished from sight under its crystal covering, the ice with which it\r\nwas incrusted showed every elegance of form which a mould so graceful\r\ncould suggest, each twig of the different boughs becoming, to all\r\nappearance, a solid bar of frosted ice, from which complicated groups of\r\nicicles streamed down. But the mass to the left was the grandest and\r\nmost beautiful of all. It consisted of two lofty heads, like weeping\r\nwillows in Carrara marble, with three or four others less lofty,\r\nresembling a family group of lions’ heads in a subdued attitude of\r\ngrief, richly decked with icy manes. Similar heads seemed to grow out\r\nhere and there from the solid sides of the huge mass, which measured\r\nseventy-six and a half feet in girth about two feet from the floor. When\r\nthis column was looked at from the side removed from the entrance to the\r\ncave, so that it stood in the centre of the light which poured down the\r\nlong slope from the outer world, the transparency of the ice made the\r\nwhole look as if it were set in a narrow frame of impalpable liquid\r\nblue—the effect of light penetrating through the mass at its extreme\r\nedges.\r\n\r\nOther and no less striking beauties rewarded our subterranean explorer\r\non his visit to the Schafloch or Trou-aux-Moutons, a vast ice-cave on\r\nthe Rothhorn, in the canton of Berne, which takes its name from the fact\r\nthat, when a sudden storm comes on, the sheep and goats make their way\r\nto it for shelter, though never going so far as the spot where the ice\r\nbegins. On entering the cave the way lies over a wild confusion of loose\r\nmasses of stone, which soon, however, begin to be intermingled with ice,\r\nuntil the latter entirely hides the naked rock under a crystal mantle.\r\n\r\n‘On either side of the cave was a grand column of ice, forming the\r\nportal, as it were, through which we must pass to further beauties. The\r\nice-floor rose to meet these columns in a graceful swelling curve,\r\nperfectly continuous, so that the general effect was that of two columns\r\nwhose roots expanded and met in the middle of the cave. Convinced that\r\ninternal investigations would prove interesting, I began to chop a hole\r\nin one of the pillars about two feet from the ground, and having made an\r\nentrance sufficiently large, proceeded to get into the cavity which\r\npresented itself. The flooring of the dome-shaped grotto in which I\r\nfound myself was loose rock, at a level of about two feet below the\r\nsurface of the ice-floor, on which my guide Christian still stood. The\r\ndome itself was not high enough to allow me to stand upright, and from\r\nthe roof, principally from the central part, a complex mass of delicate\r\nicicles passed down to the floor, leaving a narrow burrowing passage\r\nround, which was itself invaded by icicles from the lower part of the\r\nsloping roof, and by stubborn stalagmites of ice rising from the floor.\r\nThe details of this central cluster of icicles, and, in fact, of every\r\nportion of the interior of the strange grotto were exceedingly lovely,\r\nand I crushed with much regret, on hands and knees, through fair crystal\r\nforests and frozen dreams of beauty. In making the tour of this grotto,\r\ncontorting my body like a snake, to get in and out among the ice-\r\npillars, and do as little damage as might be, I yet, with all my care,\r\nwas accompanied by the incessant shiver and clatter of breaking and\r\nfalling ice. Having squeezed myself out again through the narrow hole, I\r\nnow passed between the two gigantic columns, and found that the sea of\r\nice became still broader and bolder, until we came to the edge of a\r\nglorious ice-fall, round and smooth and perfectly unbroken, passing down\r\nlike the rapids of some river too deep for its surface to be disturbed,\r\nand plunging majestically into a dark gulf, of which we could see\r\nneither the roof nor the end.’\r\n\r\nWe will now follow Mr. Browne to the Upper Glacière of St. Livres, where\r\nthe interesting discovery was made that the ice-stream which filled the\r\ncave, instead of terminating with the wall of rock at its end, turned\r\noff to the right, and was lost in darkness. By tying a candle to a long\r\nstick, and thrusting it down the slope of ice, it was further found that\r\nthe stream passed down at a very steep incline, and poured under a\r\nnarrow and low arch in the wall of the cave, beyond which nothing could\r\nbe seen. Steps were now cut down the slope by one of the party, who was\r\ncarefully let down, and, his work being completed, the others followed\r\nhim through the arch—a rather awkward undertaking, for, on pushing\r\nthrough, their breasts were pressed on to the ice, while their backs\r\nscraped against the rock which formed the roof.\r\n\r\n‘As soon as this trough was passed,’ says Mr. Browne, ‘the ice spread\r\nout like a fan, and finally landed us in a second cavern, 72 feet long\r\nby 36 feet broad, to which this was the only entrance. The breadth of\r\nthe fan at the bottom was 27 feet, and near the archway a very striking\r\ncolumn poured from a vertical fissure in the wall, and joined the main\r\nstream. The fissure was partially open to the cave, and showed the solid\r\nround column within the rock: this column measured 18½ feet in\r\ncircumference, a little below the point where it became free of the\r\nfissure, and it had a stream of ice 22 feet long pouring from its base.\r\nThe peculiar structure of the ice gave the whole mass the appearance of\r\ncoursing down very rapidly, as if the water had been frozen while thus\r\nmoving, and had not therefore ceased so to move.... At the farthest end\r\nof the cave, a lofty dome opened up in the roof, beneath which a very\r\nlovely cluster of columns had grouped itself, formed of clear porcelain-\r\nlike ice, and fretted and festooned with the utmost delicacy, as if\r\nAndersen’s Ice Maiden had been there in one of her amiable moods and had\r\nbuilt herself a palace.’\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ICE STREAMS IN THE UPPER GLACIÈRE OF ST. LIVRES.]\r\n\r\nIn Upper Styria, the Frauenmauer Mountain, which overlooks the mining\r\ntown of Eisenerz, contains a remarkable ice-chamber, consisting of a\r\ngrotto from thirty to forty fathoms long, decked with ice-crystals,\r\npillars of ice, and cascades of the same material, the floor being\r\ncomposed of ice as smooth as glass. In the summer pleasure parties\r\nassemble in the cave, and amuse themselves with sliding down its sloping\r\nice-floors.\r\n\r\nIn his work on the Natural Wonders of the Austrian Empire, the\r\nnaturalist Sartori describes his visit to an ice-cave on the Brandstein,\r\na peak situated in the same district, which thus appears to be rich in\r\nglacières. He found _crimpons_ necessary for descending the frozen snow,\r\nwhich led from the entrance to the floor of the cave, where he\r\ndiscovered pillars and capitals and pyramids of ice of every possible\r\nshape and variety, as if the cave had contained the ruins of a Gothic\r\nchurch or a fairy palace. At the further end, after passing large\r\ncascades of ice, his party reached a dark grey hole, which lighted up\r\ninto blue and green under the influence of the torches; they could not\r\ndiscover the end of this hole, and the stones which they rolled down\r\ninto it seemed to go on for ever.\r\n\r\nOther natural glacières are also mentioned as occurring in Bohemia,\r\nHungary, the Harz, in several places in North America, and probably\r\nthere are few mountainous regions without them.\r\n\r\nThe Cave of Yermalik, already mentioned among the silent retreats of\r\nnature which have been rendered infamous by the cruelty of man, is\r\nlikewise highly interesting as a natural glacière. After leaving the\r\nroomy dome in which they found the skeletons of the victims of Genghis\r\nKhan, Captain Burslem and Lieutenant Sturt proceeded through several low\r\narches and smaller caves, and reached at length a vast hall, in the\r\ncentre of which was an enormous mass of clear ice, smooth and polished\r\nas a mirror, and in the form of a gigantic beehive, with its dome-shaped\r\ntop just touching the long icicles which depended from the jagged\r\nsurface of the rock. A small aperture led to the interior of this\r\nwonderful congelation, which was divided into several compartments of\r\nevery fantastic shape. In some the glittering icicles hung like curtains\r\nfrom the roof; in others, the vault was smooth as glass. Beautifully\r\nbrilliant were the prismatic colours reflected from the varied surface\r\nof the ice when the torches flashed suddenly upon them as they passed\r\nfrom cave to cave. Around, above, beneath, everything was of solid ice,\r\nand being unable to stand on account of its slippery nature, they slid,\r\nor rather glided mysteriously, along the glassy surface of this hall of\r\nspells. In one of the largest compartments the icicles had reached the\r\nfloor, and gave the idea of pillars supporting the roof.’[27]\r\n\r\nFootnote 27:\r\n\r\n  Burslem, ‘A Peep into Toorkistan.’\r\n\r\nRocks of volcanic formation seem to afford favourable opportunities for\r\nthe congelation of water. Ice-caves are found in Mount Etna, on the Peak\r\nof Teneriffe, and among the lava-currents of Iceland.[28] Scrope visited\r\none of these natural glacières near the village of Roth, in the\r\nneighbourhood of Andernach, on the Rhine. It formed the mouth of a deep\r\nfissure in a current of basalt derived from an ancient volcanic cone\r\nabove it, and its floor was covered with a crust of ice at the time of\r\nhis visit, about noon on a very hot day in August.\r\n\r\nFootnote 28:\r\n\r\n  The Cave of Suitshellir.\r\n\r\nThe phenomenon of wind-grottoes is analogous to that of ice-caves, and\r\nnot seldom associated with it. Here cold currents of air, increasing in\r\nviolence as the day is hotter, are found to blow from the interstices of\r\nrocks. One of the most celebrated of these Æolian caverns is found near\r\nTerni in Italy. The entrance is closed by an old gate, through the\r\ncrevices of which the wind issues with a rustling noise, while in the\r\ngrotto itself the current is sufficiently strong to extinguish a torch.\r\nThe proprietors of some neighbouring villas have put the phenomenon to\r\nan ingenious use. Leaden pipes, branching out from the grotto, convey on\r\nsultry summer days an agreeable coolness through masks of gypsum with\r\nwide distended mouths, which are fixed in the walls of the apartments.\r\n\r\nThe small town of Roquefort in France has been renowned ever since the\r\ntime of the Romans for the delicious flavour of its cheese, which is\r\nsaid to owe its excellence to the cool cellars in which it is matured.\r\nThese are excavated on the northern slope of a great chalk plateau, and\r\ncommunicate with numerous fissures in the rock, from which air-currents\r\nstream forth of so low a temperature as to cause a thermometer marking\r\n+23° R. in the shade, and in the external atmosphere, to fall to +4° R.\r\nwhen exposed to their influence. The cellars are so valuable that one,\r\nwhich cost 12,000 francs in construction, sold for 215,000 francs.\r\n\r\nIn times of ignorance, superstition could not fail to attach its fables\r\nto the phenomenon of wind-grottoes. A cave near Eisenach was supposed to\r\nbe the seat of purgatory, and popular credulity or terror willingly\r\ntransformed the sounds produced by the rushing air-currents into the\r\nwailings of tormented souls.\r\n\r\nFortunately, modern science affords us a more satisfactory explanation\r\nof the phenomenon. Pictet represents the case of a cave with cold\r\ncurrents of air to be much the same as that of a mine with a vertical\r\nshaft ending in a horizontal gallery, of which one extremity is in\r\ncommunication with the open air, at a point much lower, of course, than\r\nthe upper extremity of the shaft. The cave or wind-hole corresponds to\r\nthe horizontal gallery, and the various fissures in the rock take the\r\nplace of the vertical shaft, and communicate freely with the external\r\nair. In summer the columns of air contained in these fissures assume\r\nnearly the temperature of the rock in which they rest—that is to say,\r\nthe mean temperature of the district; and therefore they are heavier\r\nthan the corresponding external columns of air which terminate at the\r\nmouth of the cave. The consequence is, that the heavy cool air descends\r\nfrom the fissures, and streams out into the cave, appearing as a cold\r\ncurrent, and the hotter the day—that is, the lighter the columns of\r\nexternal air—the more violent will be the disturbance of equilibrium,\r\nand therefore the more palpable the current.\r\n\r\nThe evaporation which takes place as the air-currents descend through\r\nthe moist rock-fissures likewise tends to lower their temperature.\r\nSeveral naturalists have attempted to explain the phenomena of ice-caves\r\nin a similar manner, as being produced by cold currents still further\r\nrefrigerated by the evaporation caused in the moist and porous rocks\r\nthrough which they pass. But to this theory there are weighty\r\nobjections, as in many ice-caves there is no current whatever, and in\r\nall the cases of cold air streams investigated or mentioned by De\r\nSaussure, the lowest temperatures observed were still considerably above\r\nthe freezing-point, and consequently incapable of converting water into\r\nice.\r\n\r\nMr. Browne believes that, in many cases, the phenomenon may be\r\nsatisfactorily accounted for by the position and surroundings of the\r\ncaves in which it occurs; though, no doubt, cold currents and\r\nevaporation may often have an influence in maintaining the low\r\ntemperature of ice-caves.\r\n\r\nIn every one of the fourteen natural glacières which he visited, the\r\nlevel at which the ice was found was considerably below the level at the\r\nentrance of the cave; so that, on ordinary principles of gravitation,\r\nthe heavy cold air within could not be dislodged by the lighter warm\r\nsummer air without. Heat naturally spreads very slowly in a cave like\r\nthis; and even when some amount of heat does reach the ice, the latter\r\nmelts but slowly, for ice absorbs 60° C. in melting; and thus when ice\r\nis once formed, it becomes a material guarantee for the permanence of\r\ncold in the cave.\r\n\r\nAnother means for preventing the encroachments of the hotter seasons is\r\nthe dense covering of trees and shrubs, which, in the case of many of\r\nthe glacières, shields their entrance or their roof from the rays of the\r\nsun, and thus keeps off the effects of direct radiation. Mr. Browne\r\nfound all the glacières that came under his observation thus protected,\r\nwith the single exception of that of St. Georges, where, in consequence\r\nof an incautious felling of wood immediately near the mouth, trunks of\r\ntrees had been laid horizontally over it, to prevent the rays of the sun\r\nfrom striking down on to the ice. He moreover invariably found that the\r\nentrances to the caves were more or less sheltered against all winds—a\r\nvery important condition, as air-currents from without would infallibly\r\nbring in heated air, in spite of the specific weight of the cold air\r\nstored within. There can be no doubt, too, that the large surfaces which\r\nare available for evaporation have much to do with maintaining a\r\nsomewhat lower temperature than the mean temperature of the place where\r\nthe cave occurs. Another great advantage which some glacières possess\r\nmust be borne in mind, namely, the collection of snow at the bottom of\r\nthe pit in which the entrance lies. This snow absorbs, in the course of\r\nmelting, all the heat which strikes down by radiation, or is driven down\r\nby accidental turns of the wind; and the snow water thus forced into the\r\ncave will, at any rate, not seriously injure the ice.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ENTRANCE TO THE GLACIÈRE OF ST. GEORGES.]\r\n\r\nIt is easy to understand how, in caves thus protected against the\r\ninfluence of summer heat, a great part of the ice accumulated during the\r\nwinter may be preserved, and that, for an explanation of the phenomenon,\r\nit is by no means necessary to have recourse to cold blasts descending\r\nfrom the interior of the rock in which they are situated. It is indeed a\r\ncommon belief that the ice-caves are colder in summer than in winter,\r\nand consequently contain a greater abundance of ice during the former\r\nseason; but this belief may well be considered as one of those popular\r\nfallacies, which—though, by dint of repetition, they come to be common\r\narticles of faith—have in fact no substantial proofs to support them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XVIII.\r\n                       ROCK TOMBS AND CATACOMBS.\r\n\r\nBiban-el-Moluk, the Royal Tombs of Thebes—The Roman Catacombs—Their\r\n  Extent—Their Mode of Excavation—Touching Sepulchral Inscriptions—\r\n  Antony Bosio, the Columbus of the Catacombs—The Cavaliere di Rossi—The\r\n  Catacombs of Naples and Syracuse—The Catacombs of Paris.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe remoteness of caves and grottoes from the busy haunts of life, their\r\neternal silence and their nightly gloom, have ever pointed them out as\r\nfit resting-places for the dead. From the earliest times they have been\r\nused as sepulchral vaults, and where nature neglected to hollow out the\r\nrock, it has often been excavated for this purpose by the hand of man.\r\n\r\nThus the Pharaohs of Egypt rested not in temples and mausoleums reared\r\nin the heart of cities, but they chose the desert-ravine for their\r\nsepulchre, and hid their tombs in deep excavations in the earth.\r\n\r\nA more impressive scene can hardly be imagined than that which is\r\nafforded by these splendid memorials. Of all such monuments which still\r\nmark the site of ancient Thebes, perhaps none are more striking to the\r\ntraveller than the royal tombs—Biban-el-Moluk—which the pride of\r\nmonarchs, whose very name is now a mystery, excavated four thousand\r\nyears ago in the bosom of the Libyan mountains.\r\n\r\n‘The next morning at daybreak,’ says Warburton,[29] ‘we started for the\r\nTombs of the Kings. I was mounted on a fine horse, belonging to the\r\nsheikh of the village, and the cool air of the morning, the rich\r\nprospect before us, and the cloudless sky, all conspired to impart life\r\nand pleasure to my relaxed and languid frame. I had been for a month\r\nalmost confined to my pallet by illness, and now, mounted on a gallant\r\nbarb, sweeping across the desert, with the mountain breezes breathing\r\nround me, I felt a glow of spirits and exhilaration of mind and body to\r\nwhich I had been long a stranger. For a couple of hours we continued\r\nalong the plain, which was partially covered with wavy corn, but flecked\r\nwidely here and there with desert tracts. Then we entered the gloomy\r\nmountain gorges, through which the Theban monarchs passed to their\r\ntombs. Our path lay through a narrow defile, between precipitous cliffs\r\nof rubble and calcareous strata, and some large boulders of coarse\r\nconglomerate lay strewn along this desolate valley, in which no living\r\nthing of earth or air ever met our view. The plains below may have been,\r\nperhaps, once swarming with life and covered with palaces; but the\r\ngloomy defile we were now traversing must have ever been as they now\r\nare, lonely, lifeless, desolate—a fit avenue to the tombs for which we\r\nwere bound.\r\n\r\nFootnote 29:\r\n\r\n  ‘The Crescent and the Cross.’\r\n\r\n‘After five or six miles’ travel, our guide stopped at the base of one\r\nof the precipices, and, laying his long spear against the rock,\r\nproceeded to light his torches. There was no entrance apparent at the\r\ndistance of a few yards, nor was this great tomb betrayed to the outer\r\nworld by any visible aperture, until discovered by Belzoni. This\r\nextraordinary man seems to have been one of the few who have hit off in\r\nlife the lot for which Nature destined them. His sepulchral instincts\r\nmight have been matter of envy to the ghouls; with such unerring\r\ncertainty did he guess at the place containing the embalmed corpses most\r\nworthy of his body-snatching energies.\r\n\r\n‘We descended by a steep path into this tomb, through a doorway covered\r\nwith hieroglyphics, and entered a corridor that ran some hundred yards\r\ninto the mountain. It was about twenty feet square, and painted\r\nthroughout most elaborately in the manner of Raphael’s Loggia at the\r\nVatican, with little inferiority of skill or colouring. The doorways\r\nwere richly ornamented with figures of a larger size, and over each was\r\nthe winged globe or a huge scarabæus. In allusion, probably, to the\r\nwanderings of the freed spirit, almost all the larger emblems on these\r\nwalls wore wings, however incompatible with their usual vocations;\r\nboats, globes, fishes, and suns, all were winged. On one of the\r\ncorridors there is an allegory of the progress of the sun through the\r\nhours, painted with great detail; the god of day sits in a boat (in\r\ncompliment to the Nile he lays aside his chariot here), and steers\r\nthrough the hours of the day and night, each of the latter being\r\ndistinguished by a star. The Nile in this, as in all other circumstances\r\nof Egyptian life, figures as the most important element; even the\r\nblessed souls for its sake assume the form of fishes, and swim about\r\nwith angelic fins in this River of Life. One gorgeous passage makes way\r\ninto another more gorgeous still, until you arrive at a steep descent.\r\nAt the base of this, perhaps 400 feet from daylight, a doorway opens\r\ninto a vaulted hall of noble proportions, whose gloom considerably\r\nincreases its apparent size. Here the body of Osirei, father of Rameses\r\nthe Second, was laid about 3,200 years ago, in the beautiful alabaster\r\nsarcophagus which Belzoni drew from hence, the reward of his enterprise.\r\nIts poor occupant, who had taken such pains to hide himself, was\r\n“undone” for the amusement of a London conversazione.\r\n\r\n‘There are numerous other tombs, all full of interest; but as the reader\r\nwho is interested in such things will consult higher authorities than\r\nmine, I shall only add that the whole circumstance of ancient Egyptian\r\nlife, with all its vicissitudes, may be read in pictures out of these\r\nextraordinary tombs, from the birth, through all the joys and sorrows of\r\nlife, to the death, the lamentations over the corpse, the embalmer’s\r\noperations, and finally the judgment and the immortality of the soul. In\r\none instance the Judge is measuring all men’s good actions in a balance\r\nagainst a feather from an angel’s wing; in another, a great serpent is\r\nbeing bound head and foot, and cast into a pit; and there are many other\r\nproofs, equally convincing, of the knowledge that this mysterious people\r\npossessed of a future life and judgment.’\r\n\r\nBut not the kings alone; the illustrious, the wealthy, the whole nation\r\nreposed in rock-tombs magnificently sculptured or rudely excavated,\r\naccording to the means of the defunct. Behind the ruins of the stately\r\ntemples of ancient Thebes, which extend from Gourna to Medinet Abou, and\r\nfill the narrow strip of desert between the inundated fields and the\r\nfoot of the mountains, lies an interminable necropolis, whose graves,\r\nlike the cells of a bee-hive, one close to the other, are hewn in the\r\nrocky ground of the plain, or in the slopes of the neighbouring hills.\r\n\r\nThese grottoes, originally destined for sarcophagi and mummies, are now\r\noccupied by fellahs and their herds, as they were in the fifth and sixth\r\ncentury by pious anchorites; and, being roomy and situated at a\r\nconsiderable height above the plain, may be considered as the most\r\nhealthy dwellings of the country.\r\n\r\nThe oldest graves are hewn in the mountains; and at a later period, when\r\nthe rocky plain at their foot alone gave room for these excavations, it\r\ngradually became invaded by the dead. In the more splendid of these\r\nmausoleums, high gates and walls inclosed deep courtyards, scooped out\r\nof the rock, and from these long corridors led to subterranean halls,\r\nprofusely decorated with sculptures and paintings.\r\n\r\nSimilar cities of the dead were found in Upper Egypt, near the cities of\r\nthe living, wherever the adjoining rocks allowed them to be excavated.\r\nThose of Syout—the ancient Lycopolis, where along an extent of several\r\nmiles the whole declivity of the Libyan mountains is perforated with\r\ngraves rising in terraces to their very summit—of El Kab (Eileithyia),\r\nof Assuan (Syene), of Madfuneh (Abydos), of Kan (Antæopolis), and of a\r\nhundred other places, would in any other country excite the wonder of\r\nthe traveller; here, where along the Nile one gigantic necropolis\r\nfollows upon another, they hardly attract any attention.\r\n\r\nBut the ancient Egyptians not only embalmed human bodies and preserved\r\nthem in rock-tombs, they also converted into mummies the various animals\r\nto which they paid divine homage, and deposited them in subterranean\r\ncavities. This honour was paid to Apis, the ox-god, to the sacred Ibis,\r\nto dogs, cats, and even to the repulsive crocodile.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBesides the Rome of the Cæsars and the Rome of the Popes, there is a\r\nthird Rome, scarcely less remarkable than the other two. The two former,\r\ngilded by the warm sunbeam, proudly rise above the banks of the Tiber\r\nwith their ruins, palaces, and churches, while the latter lies hidden\r\nbeneath the earth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GALLERY WITH TOMBS.]\r\n\r\nFrom the cupola of St. Peter’s, the most favourable station for a\r\npanoramic view of all the monuments and buildings of the Eternal City,\r\nthe eye is also best able to embrace at one glance the general\r\ntopography of the catacombs or of subterranean Rome. Fifteen great\r\nconsular roads, over which the victorious legions once marched out to\r\nsubjugate the world, radiate from the centre of the town, and furrow the\r\narid Campagna, until they are finally lost in the hazy distance. To the\r\nright and left of these causeways the catacombs have been hollowed out\r\nin the depths of the earth, and, though separated by the Tiber into two\r\ndistinct regions, yet their various subdivisions trace a vast circle,\r\nthe size of which may be measured by the circumference of the town\r\nitself. To form some idea of their extent, we must fancy an intricate\r\nwilderness of galleries and arched alcoves with their layers of\r\nsarcophagi, one above another; their _lucernaria_, for light or\r\nventilation; their stairs, straight or winding; and all this, not on one\r\nlevel only, but floor beneath floor—one, two, three, four, five—hewn out\r\non a labyrinthine, yet harmonious and economic plan. Network is perhaps\r\na feeble description of these vast and intricate mazes; a spider’s web\r\nseen through the glass of a naturalist, or rather four or five spiders’\r\nwebs, one within the other, would seem a more fitting illustration.\r\n\r\nSuch is the immensity of this city of the dead that, according to the\r\nopinion of those who have made themselves best acquainted with all its\r\nsubdivisions, their galleries, supposing them ranged in a line, would\r\nform a street 900 miles long, and lined by no less than six millions of\r\ntombs!\r\n\r\nSo vast a necropolis would command attention in any country, or as the\r\nmemorial of any age, or of any part of the human race; but to us the\r\ncatacombs of Rome are doubly interesting, as the mysterious crypts which\r\nserved the first confessors of our faith for the purposes of sepulture\r\nand sometimes of concealment. Their extent at once precludes the idea of\r\ntheir having been excavated in a clandestine manner, as was at one time\r\nerroneously believed; and, moreover, history tells us that, apart from\r\nsome passing storms of persecution, the Christians had as little reason\r\nas the Jews, their religious ancestors, for making a secret of their\r\nfaith, or of their places of interment. From the times of the Apostles\r\ntheir community constantly grew and multiplied throughout the Roman\r\nworld—in Rome especially, the centre of that world—and there can be\r\nlittle doubt that from Nerva to the middle of the reign of Marcus\r\nAurelius (from 96 to about 166) and so onward to the great persecution\r\nunder Decius (A.D. 249–256), the Christians, if exposed here and there\r\nand at times to local persecutions, were growing in unchecked and still\r\nexpanding numbers. But as the living community increased, so also must\r\nthe number of its dead, a reverence for whom was, among the survivors,\r\nnot only a solemn duty but a deep-rooted passion. The Christians not\r\nonly inherited from the Jews the ancient usage of interment, but this\r\nrespect for the dead was strengthened by the belief that Christ had\r\nrisen bodily from the grave, and that a bodily resurrection was to be\r\ntheir own glorious privilege. Hence the burning of the dead, customary\r\namong the wealthier pagans, was to them a profanation; and as the body\r\nof the slave was as holy as that of his master, it claimed the same\r\nright of decent burial.\r\n\r\nBut where was room for the spacious burial-places required for so vast a\r\ncommunity?\r\n\r\nWithin the walls of the city interment was very properly forbidden by\r\nthe law, and at a convenient distance beyond its crowded precincts,\r\nlarge plots of ground could hardly be obtained; but the formation of\r\nsubterranean cemeteries on a vast scale was greatly facilitated by the\r\ngeological formation of the land. Three different kinds of stone compose\r\nthe groundwork of the Roman campagna: the _tufa litoide_, as hard and\r\ndurable as granite, which furnished the materials for the palaces and\r\ntemples of the Cæsarian city; the _tufa granolare_, which, though\r\nconsistent enough to retain the form given it by the excavators, cannot\r\nbe hewn or extracted in blocks, and the loose _tufa friabile_, or\r\n_pozzuolana_, which has been extensively used from the earliest ages for\r\nmortar or Roman cement. It is evident that neither the hard lithoid nor\r\nthe loose tuff were suitable for the excavation of the catacombs, while\r\nthis purpose could be admirably attained in the courses of the granular\r\ntuff, which, though not too hard to be worked, is yet solid enough to\r\nmake walls for long and intricate passages, to be hewn into arches\r\nvaulting over deep recesses for the reception of coffins, and to support\r\nfloor below floor down to the utmost depth to which the formation\r\nreaches.\r\n\r\nNeither in the stone quarries nor in the sand-pits of ancient Rome is\r\nthere the slightest sign that they were ever used for the purposes of\r\nsepulture, while in the granular tuff not a yard seems to have been\r\nexcavated except for the making of tombs, which line the walls\r\nthroughout their prodigious length, as close to one another as the\r\nberths in the sides of a ship. Though the most ancient catacombs were\r\nexcavated by the Jews, yet these excavations are of a very limited\r\nextent when compared with those of Christian origin, where, instead of\r\nthe seven-branched candlestick and other sacred emblems of the Jewish\r\npersuasion, every ornament or inscription marked or painted upon the\r\nwalls bears witness to the faith of those who were deposited—to use the\r\npeculiar and appropriate expression—within these narrow cells.\r\nEverywhere we see Christian symbols only—the horse, emblematic of\r\nstrength in the faith; the hunted hare, of persecution; the dove and the\r\ncock, of the Christian virtues of vigilance and meekness; the peacock\r\nand the phœnix, of resurrection; the anchor, of hope in immortality; the\r\npalm-leaf, of the martyr’s triumph over death, and many others.\r\n\r\nThe sepulchral inscriptions are short and simple, but often extremely\r\ntender and touching, recalling to memory, in a few brief words, the\r\ninnocence and purity of life, the beauty and the wisdom, or the amiable,\r\npeace-loving character, of the deceased. The pompous or desponding tone\r\nof the heathen mortuary inscriptions disappears; the Christian ‘sleeps\r\nand sleeps in peace.’ There is no sign of affectation or hypocrisy in\r\nthese simple epitaphs, and the ennobling influence of the new creed upon\r\nthe spirit of man is, perhaps, nowhere more conspicuous than in the\r\nunostentatious inscriptions traced upon the tombs of its first\r\nconfessors.\r\n\r\nThe use of the catacombs for the various purposes of interment,\r\nassembly, or concealment began, no doubt, with the first persecution\r\nunder Nero. Most of the inscriptions however, bear the date of the\r\nfourth or fifth century, and some are evidently of a much later period.\r\nWhen this custom may have ceased is uncertain, but in the Middle Ages\r\nthe catacombs were entirely forgotten, and remained blocked up, until\r\ntowards the end of the sixteenth century, when they were reopened and\r\nexplored by the indefatigable and courageous Antony Bosio, who devoted\r\nthirty-three years of his life to this labour. During his frequent\r\nwanderings through the Roman Campagna, this zealous archæologist once\r\nfound, to the left of the Appian Way, near to the church of Sancta Maria\r\nin Palmis, a brick vault in a field covered with rubbish. He immediately\r\npresumed it to be the entrance of a catacomb, and descended through the\r\nnarrow opening. Fired with scientific ardour, he penetrated further and\r\nfurther into recesses untrodden for centuries by the foot of man. The\r\npassage soon became so narrow and low as to oblige him to creep, but\r\nneither the difficulty of the exploration, nor the fear of being crushed\r\nto death by the crumbling stones, could restrain him; and thus, day\r\nafter day, he continued his perilous search, until, finally, a complete\r\nsubterranean city revealed itself, although he could not ascertain its\r\nlimits, for, however far he might probe its intricacies, new passages\r\nwere still branching out on every side, and the maze descended in\r\nseveral successive stories deeper and deeper into the earth. After\r\nBosio, other archæologists have continued his researches, and in our\r\ndays the Cavaliere de Rossi—to whose indefatigable zeal is due, amongst\r\nothers, the discovery of the Catacomb of Callistus, where many of the\r\nearly popes have been entombed—has all but completed the topography of\r\nsubterranean Rome.\r\n\r\nBesides the ancient metropolis of the world, several other old Italian\r\ntowns possess remarkable catacombs or subterranean burial-places. Those\r\nof Naples, historically far less interesting than those of Rome, are\r\nexecuted on a far more spacious plan. They are situated not beneath the\r\ntown itself, but in a neighbouring mountain, where they have been\r\nexcavated to a distance of more than two miles. Large galleries,\r\neighteen feet broad, and fourteen or fifteen high, branch out into a\r\nnumber of smaller passages, while the walls on both sides are pierced,\r\nlike those in Rome, with horizontal sepulchral cavities, six, or even\r\nseven, one above the other.\r\n\r\nThe Catacombs of Syracuse, under the site of the ancient Achradina, are\r\nthe largest and best preserved known. They are all excavated in the\r\nsolid rock, and form lofty vaults, very different from the narrow and\r\ndangerous burrows of subterranean Rome. A broad gallery runs through the\r\nwhole of the labyrinth, and from this many other passages of an inferior\r\nwidth branch out, leading to large circular vaults with openings at the\r\ntop for the admission of light. Many of these have been closed, as they\r\nwere equally dangerous for the people in their neighbourhood and their\r\ncattle, so that torches are necessary for visiting them. Along the walls\r\nare a number of niches, which served as sepulchres, so that these\r\nexcavations, which originally were quarries, and during the flourishing\r\ntimes of the city were used by its vast population for various household\r\npurposes, were ultimately converted into a city of the dead.\r\n\r\nThe Catacombs of Paris, though ancient as quarries, are of a very modern\r\ndate as places of sepulture. Until the end of the reign of Louis XVI.\r\nthe principal burying-ground of Paris had been the Cemetery of the\r\nInnocents, near the church of the same name. Originally situated beyond\r\nthe walls of the town, it had in course of time been so surrounded by\r\nthe growing metropolis as to occupy its centre. Here, during nearly ten\r\ncenturies, numberless bodies had been deposited, so that, from the\r\nmalaria it engendered, it became a constant source of danger to the\r\nliving. At length the cemetery became so intolerable a nuisance that its\r\nsuppression and conversion into a public market-place was decreed in\r\n1785.\r\n\r\nThe question now arose where the bones to be displaced should be\r\ndeposited, and, from their proximity to the town and their extent, the\r\nancient quarries were chosen as the most favourable spot for a vast\r\nsubterranean necropolis. But these immense excavations, which, having\r\nbeen abandoned for several centuries, had in many places fallen in,\r\nneeded a full year for repairs before they could be safely used for\r\ntheir new purpose. At length, on April 7, 1787, they were solemnly\r\nconsecrated, and the same day the workmen began to remove the bones from\r\nthe Cemetery of the Innocents—an operation which needed more than\r\nfifteen months for its completion. Gradually many others of the ancient\r\ncemeteries of Paris were in like manner removed to the catacombs, so\r\nthat they are said to contain the bones of more than three millions of\r\nbodies. All these bones are symmetrically piled up along the sides of\r\nthe galleries; the apophyses of the large thigh and arm bones are\r\ndisposed in front, so as to make a nearly uniform surface, interrupted\r\nfrom space to space by a row of skulls. Some of the crypts or sepulchral\r\nchambers are rather lugubriously decorated with festoons or pyramids of\r\nskulls and cross-bones, and many of the stone pillars which support the\r\nvaults have likewise received ornaments of the same sexton taste. Sixty-\r\nthree staircases lead from different parts of the town into the\r\ncatacombs, and are used by the workmen and agents appointed to take care\r\nof the subterranean necropolis; but visitors are admitted only every\r\nthree months by the entrance at the Barrière du Maine. A descent of\r\nninety steps brings them to a narrow gallery, which conducts them, after\r\nseveral windings to the more roomy vaults where the bones are deposited;\r\nand after wandering for some time among these gloomy memorials which are\r\npiled up on either side, they finally emerge into daylight through\r\nanother gallery, similar to the first. No doubt Paris affords many a\r\nmore pleasant ramble, but hardly one more interesting, or capable of\r\nmaking a deeper impression on the mind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIX.\r\n              CAVES CONTAINING REMAINS OF EXTINCT ANIMALS.\r\n\r\nThe Cave Hyena and the Cave Bear—The Cavern of Kirkdale—The Moa Caves in\r\n  New Zealand—Various Species of Moas—Their enormous size.\r\n\r\n\r\nBesides their picturesque beauty or their solemn grandeur, some caves\r\nare extremely interesting as containing the bones of _extinct_\r\nquadrupeds or birds. Unrivalled in point of antiquity by the oldest\r\ntombs erected by man, they carry us back to times which, though of\r\ncomparatively recent date, are still so far removed from the present day\r\nas almost to terrify the imagination—for how many ages must have\r\nelapsed, and what changes of climate must have taken place, since the\r\nhyena or the tiger inhabited the grottoes of northern Europe?\r\n\r\nIn many cases the bones found in ossiferous caves must have been washed\r\ninto them by currents of water, or else they may be the remains of\r\nanimals that accidentally dropped in through holes in the roof; but\r\nthere can be no doubt that frequently the caves in which the bones of\r\nextinct carniverous animals have been found, served as their dens while\r\nthey were living. The abundance of bony dung associated with the remains\r\nof the hyena, as well as the great number of bones all belonging to one\r\nspecies which are frequently found congregated in the same cave, is\r\nstrongly confirmatory of this opinion, no less than the circumstance\r\nthat the walls of several ossiferous caves, when deprived of their\r\nstalactital covering, have been found smoothed or rounded off from the\r\nfrequent ingress and egress of their former inhabitants as they squeezed\r\nthemselves or dragged their prey through a narrow passage. Besides, the\r\nhyenas and bears of the present day frequently live in caves, thus\r\njustifying the inference that their extinct predecessors had the same\r\nhabit.\r\n\r\nThe antiquity of many of the animal remains found in caves is proved not\r\nonly by their being dissimilar to existing species, but by the manner in\r\nwhich they are entombed. For ages they accumulated on the floor of the\r\ncave, often to a considerable depth, mixed with mud or sand or fragments\r\nof rock—then, when, from a change of level or some other cause, the\r\ncavern became uninhabited, a thick crust of stalagmite was slowly\r\nformed, and burying them all, as under solid stone, preserved them\r\nundisturbed, until some accident revealed their existence after a time\r\nthe length of which escapes all calculation. The dim vista into the past\r\nappears still more shadowy in the case of the cavern discovered by Dr.\r\nSchmerling at Choquier about two leagues from Liège, where three\r\ndistinct beds of stalagmite were found, and between each of them a mass\r\nof breccia and mud, mixed with quartz, pebbles, and in the three\r\ndeposits the bones of extinct quadrupeds!\r\n\r\nOssiferous caves have been found and examined in many parts of the\r\nworld: in France, in Belgium, chiefly in the valleys of the Meuse and\r\nits tributaries; in Austria and Hungary, in Germany and England.\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable that while the remains of a large and extinct species\r\nof bear, although found in our caves, are much more common on the\r\nContinent, the bones of the hyena form by far the largest proportion of\r\nthose obtained from the English caverns. Thus under the incrustated\r\nfloors of our rock-crevices and hollows, we And the proofs that our\r\nisland was once inhabited by brutes which are now confined to Africa and\r\nthe adjacent parts of Asia. But the extinct hyena of England was a much\r\nlarger and more formidable animal than either the striped hyena of\r\nAbyssinia or the spotted hyena of the Cape, the latter of whom it most\r\nresembled. The abundance of these animals, and the length of the period\r\nduring which they inhabited England, may be inferred from Dr. Buckland’s\r\naccount of the opening of the celebrated cavern of Kirkdale.\r\n\r\n‘The bottom of the cave, on first removing the mud, was found to be\r\nstrewed all over, like a dog-kennel, from one end to the other, with\r\nhundreds of teeth and bones, and on some of the bones marks could be\r\ntraced, which, on applying one to the other, appeared exactly to fit the\r\nform of the canine teeth of the hyena that occurred in the cave. Mr.\r\nGibson alone collected more than three hundred canine teeth of the\r\nhyena, which must have belonged to at least seventy-five individuals,\r\nand adding to these the similar teeth I have seen in other collections,\r\nI cannot calculate the total number of hyenas, of which there is\r\nevidence, at less than two or three hundred.’\r\n\r\nThe grisly bear of the Rocky Mountains (_Ursus ferox_) is the most\r\nferocious of its race at the present day. It is about nine feet long,\r\nand is said to attain the weight of 800 pounds. Its strength is so\r\nprodigious that even the bison contends with it in vain. But this huge\r\nand formidable animal was surpassed in size and strength by the extinct\r\nbear (_Ursus spelaeus_) which once inhabited the caverns of Europe, at a\r\ntime when vast and interminable forests covered the land, and the Rhine\r\nand the Danube flowed through wastes like those through which the\r\nMackenzie or the Yenissei now find their way to the ocean.\r\n\r\nFrom the proportions of the molar teeth, and from some peculiarities of\r\nappearance and wearing, it has been inferred that this extinct species\r\nlived chiefly on vegetable food; but its prodigious strength, and the\r\nhuge canines with which its jaws were armed, enabled it to cope with its\r\ncontemporaries, the large Auerox and the teichorhine rhinoceros, and to\r\ndefend itself successfully against the large lion or tiger whose remains\r\nhave also been found in the caverns of western Europe, and which, if we\r\nmay judge by the size of their canine teeth, must have been more than a\r\nmatch for the largest felides of the present day.\r\n\r\nBesides the hyena and the bear, more than a hundred species of extinct\r\nanimals have been discovered in our ossiferous caves. In those of\r\nPaviland, Glamorganshire, bones of a primeval elephant have been found;\r\nand in that of Wirksworth, Derbyshire, the almost entire skeleton of a\r\nrhinoceros lay buried in a considerable mass of gravel and osseous\r\nfragments. How the large creature came there is a question that may well\r\nexercise the ingenuity of a geologist.\r\n\r\nThough in these and similar cases, the bone-caves have been found to\r\ncontain the remains of animals very different from those now existing in\r\nthe same region, yet in general they show a remarkable relationship, in\r\nthe same land or continent, between the dead and the living. Thus in the\r\ncaves of Brazil there are extinct species of all the thirty-two genera,\r\nexcepting four, of the terrestrial quadrupeds now inhabiting the\r\nprovinces in which the caves occur, such as fossil ant-eaters,\r\narmadilloes, tapirs, peccaries, guanacoes, opossums, and numerous South\r\nAmerican gnawers, monkeys and other animals.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CAVE IN DREAM LEAD MINE, NEAR WIRKSWORTH, DERBYSHIRE.]\r\n\r\nThe kangaroo, as is well-known, is peculiar to Australia, and caverns in\r\nthat country have been described by Sir T. Mitchell, containing fossil\r\nbones of a large extinct kangaroo.\r\n\r\nA singular wingless bird, the Apteryx australis, is found only in the\r\nwilds of the interior of New Zealand, where it takes refuge in the\r\nclefts of rocks, hollow trees, or in deep holes which it excavates in\r\nthe ground. The caves of that country show us that it was preceded by\r\nother wingless birds of a gigantic structure—the Moas, by the side of\r\nwhich even the ostriches of the present day would shrink into\r\ncomparative insignificance.\r\n\r\nThese wonderful creatures would probably have remained unknown to the\r\npresent day, if, in 1839, the thigh-bone of a Moa had not fallen by\r\nchance into the hands of Professor Owen, who from this single fragment\r\ndrew up a surprisingly correct notice of the bird. This memoir, sent out\r\nto New Zealand, gave a stimulus to further researches, and from the\r\nlarger quantity of the Moa’s bones now sent to England, Professor Owen\r\nbuilt up the beautiful skeleton which, along with those of the Mylodon\r\nrobustus, of the Mammoth, and of the primeval stag, forms one of the\r\nmost conspicuous ornaments of the splendid Museum in Lincoln’s Inn\r\nFields.\r\n\r\nBut the reconstructive genius of our great palæontologist, not satisfied\r\nwith this triumph, has detected a whole group of ostrich-like birds\r\namong the remnants of the past, which the New Zealanders, who, as we may\r\nsuppose, are no adepts in comparative anatomy, all confound under the\r\ncommon name of the Moa; and thus five species of Dinornis, the\r\nPalaeopteryx, the Aptornis, and the comparatively small Notornis, have\r\nbeen, as it were, resuscitated by a miracle of science. A specimen of\r\nthe last-named species of these birds was caught alive in a remote,\r\nunfrequented part of the south island of New Zealand in 1850 by some\r\nsealers, who, ignorant of the value of their prize, killed and devoured\r\nit as if it had been a common turkey. Fortunately, however, the skin of\r\nthis unique bird, the link between the living and the dead, the last\r\nperhaps of a race coeval with the gigantic Moas, was preserved from\r\ndestruction.\r\n\r\nThe largest species of Moa (_Dinornis robustus_) must have stood, when\r\nalive, about thirteen or fourteen feet high, since Dr. Thomson saw a\r\ncomplete leg, which stood six feet from the ground. Like the ostrich,\r\nthis feathered giant was incapable of flight, its rudimentary wings\r\nbeing unable to raise it from the ground. It had three toes on each\r\nfoot, and tradition says that its feathers were beautiful and gaudy.\r\nPortions of the eggs of the bird have been found among their bones, of a\r\nsufficient size to estimate the probable size of a whole egg, and the\r\nconclusion is that the hat of a full-grown man would have been a proper-\r\nsized egg-cup for it. From the structure of the toes, which were well\r\nadapted for digging up roots, and from the traditional report that the\r\nMoas were in the habit of swallowing stones to promote digestion, it may\r\nbe concluded that they were herbivorous.\r\n\r\nThis is about as much as we know of the aspect and habits of this\r\ncolossal Struthionide, whose apparent confinement to the small New\r\nZealandic group is one of the most curious enigmas of its history. As it\r\nis extremely improbable that so gigantic a race was originally formed\r\nfor so narrow a sphere, we are led to believe that New Zealand is but\r\nthe remnant of a vast continent now whelmed under the waves of the\r\nPacific.\r\n\r\nWhen the group was first peopled by the Maories, about five hundred\r\nyears ago, the Moas had already become excessively rare, and the last of\r\nthem seem to have perished during the seventeenth century, though the\r\nNew Zealanders believe that some of them still live in the remote and\r\nunfrequented wilds of their native land.\r\n\r\nThe bones of the various species of Moa have been partly found in\r\nmorasses, partly in the beds of mountain torrents, but chiefly in\r\nvarious caves, which, no doubt, served the living animals as dwellings\r\nor places of refuge.\r\n\r\nOne of these caverns, called by the New Zealanders ‘Te Anaoteatua,’ or\r\nthe Cave of the Spirit, was visited by Dr. Thomson,[30] who describes it\r\nas very remarkable. It is situated in the tertiary, extremely cavernous,\r\nand undermined limestone mountain chain which extends along the west\r\ncoast of the northern island, and whose picturesque beauties and natural\r\ncuriosities are destined to occupy a conspicuous place in some future\r\nguide-book. Its entrance, resembling the gateway of an old castle, is\r\nconcealed by a thick foliage of shrubs, and a dark green creeper adheres\r\nto the limestone rock and covers the opening. The cave extends in a\r\ntortuous direction underneath the hill for upwards of a mile, and\r\nconsists of several different passages. From its roof and sides numerous\r\nstalactites are hanging, some of them six feet long, and composed of\r\ntransparent calcareous spar, while others have a red tint. In that part\r\nof the cave which Dr. Thomson explored, there were three openings in the\r\nroof at different places, each from ten to fifteen feet in\r\ncircumference, through which light was seen streaming in, one hundred\r\nand fifty feet above the head. Immediately below these openings there\r\nwere heaps of wood and _débris_ washed down from the surface; but these\r\nopenings did not throw much light into the cave, so that even during the\r\nday it was perfectly dark. A subterranean stream of water runs through\r\npart of it, and then disappears under the rock.\r\n\r\nFootnote 30:\r\n\r\n  ‘On the Moa Caves of New Zealand.’ Edinburgh New Philosophical\r\n  Journal, vol. lvi. 1854.\r\n\r\nBefore the introduction of Christianity, this cave was held in the\r\ngreatest terror by all New Zealanders, and no one would have ventured to\r\nenter it; but as Moa bones fetch a high price, the love of money at\r\nlength conquered the superstitious fears of some Christian natives, and\r\ntheir boldness was rewarded by a tolerably rich harvest of bones,\r\nalthough their search was made in a very hasty and imperfect manner.\r\n\r\nAnother cave situated in the same neighbourhood, and bearing the\r\nindigenous name of ‘Te Anaotemoa’ or the Cave of the Moa, did not enjoy\r\nthe privilege of spiritual protection, and the Maories were in the habit\r\nof resorting to it to procure the skulls of the Moas, to keep the powder\r\nwhich they used for tattooing, and their long bones for the manufacture\r\nof fish-hooks, before they became acquainted with the use of iron.\r\n\r\nThe Cave of the Moa is in a limestone hill, with two openings, one\r\ntowards the north-east and the other towards the south-west. The north-\r\neast opening has evidently been caused by the falling in of the roof,\r\nand is apparently of no great age; the south-west entrance is 14 feet\r\nhigh and 10 feet broad, and covered over with trees and bushes. The cave\r\nis 165 feet long, the greatest breadth 28 feet, and the height 60 feet.\r\nThe roof is oval, and numerous stalactites drop gracefully from it,\r\ngiving a cathedral-like effect to the whole. One part of the floor is\r\ncovered over with calcareous spar, another part with a large deposit of\r\nsoft stalagmites, and the part of the floor furthest distant from the\r\nsouth-west opening is covered with earth, limestones, and mud, which\r\nappear to have fallen down when the roof of the cave gave way, which now\r\nforms the north-east opening. It is under this earth, and the soft\r\ndeposit of carbonate of lime, that the Moas’ bones are found. Dr.\r\nThomson got only four skulls in this cave, and the scarcity of them was\r\naccounted for by their use in former days as powder-holders. There was\r\nnothing to lead him to think that these bones had been deposited in the\r\ncave by water, for he found a remnant of almost every bone in the body,\r\nfrom the spine and the rings of the trachea down to the last bone of the\r\ntoes. The bones belonged to the largest and also to the smaller species\r\nof Moas.\r\n\r\nIt would require several days’ labour of many men to clear out the\r\nbottom of this cave properly, in order to see what bones it contains;\r\nbut, as far as Dr. Thomson saw, there were no osseous remains of man or\r\nof any animals, except Moas, in it, nor any marks of fire, sculpture,\r\nnor figures of any kind on the walls of the cave.\r\n\r\nThere are, no doubt, many other grottoes and cavities containing Moas’\r\nbones in the islands, but they are carefully kept secret by the natives,\r\nas, on account of the high price paid for the bones, they may almost be\r\nregarded as small gold-mines.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XX.\r\n                SUBTERRANEAN RELICS OF PREHISTORIC MAN.\r\n\r\nThe Peat Mosses of Denmark—Shell Mounds—Swiss Lacustrine Dwellings—\r\n  Ancient Mounds in the Valley of the Mississippi—The Caves in the\r\n  Valley of the Meuse—Dr. Schmerling—Human Skulls in the Cave of Engis—\r\n  Explorations of Sir Charles Lyell in the Cave of Engihoul—Caverns of\r\n  Brixham—Caves of Gower—the Sepulchral Grotto of Aurignac—Flint\r\n  Implements discovered in the Valley of the Somme—Gray’s Inn Lane an\r\n  ancient Hunting Ground for Mammoths.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the various researches of geologists, there are perhaps none of a\r\nmore general interest than those which relate to the antiquity of the\r\nhuman race. We would gladly know whether those strata and caves which\r\ncontain so many relics of the past afford us also some insight into the\r\nprimitive condition of man—some indication of the times when he first\r\nappeared upon the stage of life. Within the last years many discoveries\r\nhave been made which have thrown light upon the subject, and proved\r\nthat, though man, geologically speaking, is of recent origin, and\r\nprobably the youngest born of creation, his ancestry still stretches\r\nback at least as far as that remote period when the huge Mammoth ranged\r\nover the north, when the cavern bear and the cavern hyena tenanted the\r\nexcavations of our limestone hills, and the uncouth form of the\r\nrhinoceros brushed through the dense primeval forests of our land. In\r\nthe following pages I intend briefly to point out some of the most\r\ninteresting of these discoveries.\r\n\r\nThe peat-mosses of Denmark, varying in depth from ten to thirty feet,\r\nshow their enormous antiquity by the changes which have taken place in\r\nthe vegetation of the land since the first periods of their growth. At\r\ntheir lowest levels lie thick prostrate trunks of the Scotch fir, which\r\nmust once have grown on their margin, but which is not now, nor has ever\r\nbeen in historical times, a native of the Danish isles. At higher levels\r\nthe pines disappear, and are supplanted by the sessile variety of the\r\ncommon oak, while still higher occurs the pedunculated variety of the\r\nsame oak, now in its turn almost superseded by the common beech. It is\r\nimpossible to calculate the number of ages needed to bring about these\r\nvast changes in the forest scenery of Denmark—a very moderate estimate\r\ncarries them back seven thousand years—but at every depth in the peat,\r\nand under all these various trees, implements and other articles of\r\nhuman workmanship have been found, which show that, since the appearance\r\nof man, the fir and the oak have successively flourished and\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the peat-mosses, the Danish ‘shell-mounds’ throw some\r\nlight on the prehistoric ages of that northern land. These mounds, or\r\n‘refuse-heaps,’ consisting chiefly of thousands of cast-away shells of\r\nthe oyster, cockle, and other molluscs of existing species, may be seen\r\nat certain points along the shores of nearly all the Danish islands. The\r\nshells are plentifully mixed up with the bones of various quadrupeds,\r\nbirds, and fishes, which served as the food of the savages by whom the\r\nmounds were accumulated, while scattered all through them are rude\r\nimplements of stone, horn, wood, and bone, with fragments of coarse\r\npottery, mixed with charcoal and cinders, but never any implements of\r\nbronze or of iron. Similar refuse-heaps are found near the huts of many\r\nwild nations of the present day, as, for instance, near the miserable\r\nwigwams of the Fuegians, who live chiefly upon limpets.\r\n\r\nThe most striking proof that the Danish refuse-heaps are very old is\r\nderived from the character of their imbedded shells. These, indeed,\r\nbelong entirely to living species, but the common eatable oyster is now\r\nunknown in the brackish waters of the Baltic, and the eatable mussels,\r\ncockles, and periwinkles, which in the refuse-heaps are as large as\r\nthose which grow in the open sea, now only attain a third of their\r\nnatural size. Hence we may confidently infer that in the days when the\r\nsavage inhabitants of the Danish coasts accumulated these heaps, the\r\nocean must have had freer access than now to the Baltic, and mixed its\r\nwaters through broader channels with those of that inland sea.\r\n\r\nAs in the peat-bogs the implements and weapons found buried with the\r\nScotch fir are all made of stone, whereas those coinciding with the oak\r\nepoch are made of bronze, we may farther conclude that the stone\r\nhatchets and knives of the refuse-heaps likewise belong to the same\r\ndistant period when evergreen forests flourished in the Danish isles.\r\n\r\nThe ancient Swiss lacustrine dwellings, so frequently mentioned of late\r\nyears, afford us another highly interesting glimpse into remote\r\nprehistoric ages. They seem first to have attracted attention during the\r\ndry season of 1853–4, when the lakes and rivers were unusually low, and\r\nwhen the inhabitants of Meilen on the Lake of Zurich resolved to raise\r\nthe level of some ground, by throwing upon it the mud obtained by\r\ndredging in the adjoining shallow water. During these dredging\r\noperations they discovered a number of wooden piles deeply driven into\r\nthe bed of the lake, and, among them, many stone instruments, fragments\r\nof rude pottery, fishing gear, and the bones of various animals; those\r\nwhich contained marrow being split open, in the same way as those found\r\nin the Danish shell-mounds.[31]\r\n\r\nFootnote 31:\r\n\r\n  See also the article on Lacustrine Abodes, in the Edin. Review, July\r\n  1862.\r\n\r\nThe ruins thus unexpectedly brought to light were evidently those of a\r\nvillage of unknown date, and since then many other hill-dwellings (more\r\nthan a hundred and fifty in all) have been detected near the borders of\r\nthe Swiss lakes, at points where the depth of water does not exceed\r\nfifteen feet. Such aquatic sites were probably selected as places of\r\nsafety, since they could be approached only by a narrow bridge or by\r\nboats, and the water would serve for protection alike against wild\r\nanimals and human foes. The relative age of the pile-dwellings is\r\nclearly illustrated by the nature of the relics that lie scattered among\r\ntheir ruins. In some, only bronze utensils or ornaments are found; in\r\nothers all the articles are of stone. The former, indicating an advance\r\nin civilisation, are evidently of a more recent age, but, even among the\r\nvillages of the stone period, some are of later date than others, as\r\nthey exhibit signs of an improved state of the arts. Thus we have here a\r\nlong perspective into an unknown past, for even the bronze villages are\r\nprobably of an age long antecedent to the Roman period. The oldest stone\r\nsettlements are perhaps as old as the times of the Danish refuse-heaps;\r\nbut even among their ruins, some domesticated animals occur, namely, the\r\nox, sheep, goat, and dog, and the appearance of three cereals indicates\r\nthat the population had already made some progress in the agricultural\r\narts. Amber ornaments, which could only have found their way from the\r\nBaltic, as also hatchets and wedges of jade, of a kind not occurring in\r\nSwitzerland or in the adjoining parts of Europe, and which some\r\nmineralogists would derive from the East, prove the existence of an\r\nactive commercial intercourse, even at that early age, which the Swiss\r\narchæologists and geologists carry back as far as 7,000 years.\r\n\r\nIn the basin of the Mississippi, and especially in the valley of the\r\nOhio and its tributaries, many large mounds have been found, which have\r\nserved in some cases for temples, in others for outlook or defence, and\r\nin others for sepulture. Some of these earthworks are on so grand a\r\nscale as to embrace areas of fifty or a hundred acres within a simple\r\ninclosure; and the solid contents of one mound are estimated at twenty\r\nmillions of cubic feet, equal to about one-fourth of the bulk of the\r\nGreat Pyramid of Egypt. From several of these repositories pottery and\r\nornamental sculpture have been taken, as also weapons made of unpolished\r\nhornstone and various articles in silver and copper. An active\r\ncommercial intercourse must have existed between the Ohio mound-builders\r\nand the natives of distant regions, as mica from the Alleghanies, sea-\r\nshells from the Gulf of Mexico, obsidian from the Mexican mountains, and\r\nimplements made of native copper from Lake Superior, have been found\r\namong the buried articles.\r\n\r\nThe extraordinary number of the mounds implies a long period during\r\nwhich a settled agricultural population, considerably advanced in the\r\nindustrial arts, occupied the fertile valleys or the alluvial plains in\r\nthe basin of the Mississippi, covered, since then, with vast forests,\r\nand tenanted by wild hunters without any traditionary connexion with\r\ntheir more civilised predecessors. The epoch when this people\r\nflourished, or the adverse circumstances which swept them away, are all\r\nequally unknown; but the age and nature of the trees found growing on\r\nsome of their earthworks afford at least some data for estimating the\r\nminimum of time which must have passed since the mounds were abandoned.\r\n\r\nTrunks, displaying eight hundred rings of annual growth, have been cut\r\ndown from them, and several generations of trees must have lived and\r\ndied before the mounds could have been overspread with that variety of\r\nspecies which they supported when the white man first set foot in the\r\nvalley of the Ohio. In a memoir on this subject, General Harrison, who\r\nwas skilled in woodcraft, observes that ‘beyond all doubt no trees were\r\nallowed to grow so long as the earthworks were in use; and when they\r\nwere forsaken, the ground, like all newly cleared ground in Ohio, would\r\nfor a time be monopolised by one or two species of tree, such as the\r\nyellow locust and the black or white walnut. When the individuals which\r\nwere the first to get possession of the ground had died out one after\r\nthe other, they would in many cases, instead of being replaced by the\r\nsame species, be succeeded (by virtue of the law which makes a rotation\r\nof crops profitable in agriculture) by other kinds, till at last, after\r\na great number of centuries (several thousand years, perhaps), that\r\nremarkable diversity of species characteristic of North America, and far\r\nexceeding what is seen in European forests, would be established.’\r\n\r\nIn all the cases hitherto mentioned, the remains or relics of\r\nprehistoric man, however remote a date we may assign to them, have been\r\nfound associated with fossil shells and mammalia of living species. In\r\nthe instances I am now about to relate, we advance a step further back,\r\nand find man the contemporary either of extinct mammalia or such as\r\ncould now no longer exist in the lands where once they throve. As the\r\nmere mention of the numerous caves in Belgium, England, France, and\r\nGermany, in which human bones or articles of human workmanship have been\r\nfound embedded along with the fossil remains of extinct animals, would\r\ntire the reader’s patience, I select from the number a few which have\r\nafforded the most convincing proofs of the antiquity of man. The credit\r\nof having given the first impulse to these fruitful investigations is\r\ndue to the late Dr. Schmerling, of Liège, who, with untiring zeal,\r\ndevoted several years of his life to the exploring of the ossiferous\r\ncaverns which border the valley of the Meuse and its tributaries. To\r\ngain access to many of the caves was in itself no easy task, as their\r\nopenings could be reached only by a rope tied to a tree; and when we\r\nconsider that, after these arduous preliminaries, Dr. Schmerling had\r\nfrequently to creep on all fours through contracted passages leading to\r\nlarger chambers, there to superintend by torchlight, week after week,\r\nand year after year, the workmen who were breaking through a stalagmitic\r\ncrust as hard as marble, in order to remove, piece by piece, the\r\nunderlying bone breccia nearly as hard, and that while thus directing\r\ntheir labours he stood for hours with his feet in the mud, and with\r\nwater dripping from the roof on his head, in order to mark the position\r\nand guard against the loss of each single bone which they brought to\r\nlight, we can scarcely praise too highly his rare devotion to the cause\r\nof science.\r\n\r\nAmong these caverns thus laboriously explored, that of Engis was found\r\nto contain the remains of at least three human beings deeply buried\r\nunder a thick floor of stalagmite. The skull of one of these, who may\r\nhave been a beauty when the Meuse flowed at least fifty feet above its\r\npresent channel, was embedded by the side of a mammoth’s tooth. Another\r\nskull was buried five feet deep in a breccia in which the tooth of a\r\nrhinoceros, several bones of a horse, and some of the reindeer, together\r\nwith some ruminants, occurred. On the right bank of the Meuse, on the\r\nopposite side of the river to Engis, is the cavern of Engihoul, where\r\nlikewise bones of extinct animals, mingled with those of man, were\r\nobserved to abound; but with this difference, that whereas in the Engis\r\ncave there were several human crania and but very few other bones, in\r\nEngihoul there occurred numerous bones of the extremities belonging to\r\nat least three human beings, and only two small fragments of a cranium.\r\nNone of the caves examined by Schmerling contained an example of an\r\nentire skeleton, and the bones were invariably so rolled and scattered\r\nas to preclude all idea of their having been intentionally buried on the\r\nspot. As no gnawed bones nor any coprolites were found, he inferred that\r\nthe caverns of the province of Liège had not been the den of wild\r\nbeasts, but that their organic and inorganic contents had been swept\r\ninto them by streams communicating with the surface of the country. In\r\n1860 Sir Charles Lyell, on a visit to Liège, determined still further to\r\nexamine the Cave of Engihoul, into which Schmerling had delved in 1831,\r\nand engaged some workmen to break through the crust of stalagmite with\r\nthe intention of searching for bones in the undisturbed earth beneath.\r\nBones and teeth of the cave-bear were soon found, and, at the depth of\r\ntwo feet below the crust of stalagmite, three fragments of a human\r\nskull, and two perfect lower jaws with teeth, all associated with the\r\nbones of bears, large pachyderms and ruminants, and so precisely\r\nresembling these in colour and state of preservation as to leave no\r\ndoubt that man was contemporary with the extinct animals.\r\n\r\nOur English bone-caves have likewise afforded abundant proofs of the\r\nantiquity of our race. In 1858 a new series of caverns having been\r\naccidentally discovered near the sea at Brixham, by the roof of one of\r\nthem being broken through in quarrying, the Royal Society resolved to\r\nhave it scientifically and thoroughly examined. The united length of the\r\ngalleries which were cleared out under the superintendence of\r\nexperienced geologists amounted to several hundred feet. Their width\r\nnever exceeded eight feet. They were sometimes filled up to the roof\r\nwith mud, but occasionally there was a considerable space between the\r\nroof and floor. The numerous fossils discovered during the progress of\r\nthe excavations were all numbered and labelled with reference to a\r\njournal in which the geological position of each specimen was recorded\r\nwith scrupulous care.\r\n\r\nAs in many other bone-caverns, the underground passages and channels\r\nwere generally found floored with a layer of stalagmite, varying in\r\nthickness from one to fifteen inches, and next below occurred loam or\r\nbone-earth from two to fifteen feet in thickness. In the latter were\r\nfound remains of the mammoth, of the cave-bear, of the cave-lion, and\r\nother extinct mammalia. No human bones were obtained, but many flint\r\nknives, chiefly from the lowest part of the bone-earth, and one of the\r\nmost perfect lay at the depth of thirteen feet from the surface, and was\r\ncovered with bone-earth of that thickness.\r\n\r\nAt one point in the overlying stalagmite a perfect reindeer’s horn was\r\nfound sticking, and in another an entire humerus of the cave-bear—a\r\nconvincing proof that both these animals must have lived after the flint\r\ntools were manufactured, or in other words that man in this district\r\npreceded the cave-bear. ‘A glance at the position of Windmill Hill, in\r\nwhich the caverns are situated, and a brief survey of the valleys which\r\nbound it on three sides, are enough to satisfy a geologist that the\r\ndrainage and geographical features of this region have undergone great\r\nchanges since the gravel and bone-earth were carried by streams into the\r\nsubterranean cavities. Some worn pebbles of hematite, in particular, can\r\nonly have come from their nearest parent rock at a period when the\r\nvalleys immediately adjoining the caves were much shallower than they\r\nnow are. The reddish loam in which the bones are embedded is such as may\r\nbe seen on the surface of limestone in the neighbourhood, but the\r\ncurrents which were formerly charged with such mud must have run at a\r\nlevel seventy-eight feet above that of the stream now flowing in the\r\nsame valley.’[32]\r\n\r\nFootnote 32:\r\n\r\n  Lyell, ‘Antiquity of Man,’ p. 101.\r\n\r\nIn 1861, Colonel Wood found, in a newly discovered cave of the peninsula\r\nof Gower, in Glamorganshire, the remains of two species of rhinoceros,\r\nR. teichorhinus and R. hemitœchus, in an undisturbed deposit, in the\r\nlower part of which were some well-shaped flint knives, evidently of\r\nhuman workmanship. This is the first well-authenticated example of the\r\noccurrence of human implements in connexion with R. hemitœchus—the first\r\nproof that this extinct brute, elsewhere the usual companion of the\r\nmammoth, has been coeval with man.\r\n\r\nIn 1852, on the side of a hill near the small town of Aurignac in the\r\nSouth of France, a sepulchral grotto was discovered which, though\r\nunadorned and rude, is of the highest interest, as in point of antiquity\r\nit surpasses all other burial-places known, and leads us back to times\r\nlong anterior to the oldest traditions of our race. In that year a\r\nlabourer observed that rabbits, when hotly pursued by the sportsman, ran\r\ninto a hole which they had burrowed in a talus of rubbish washed down\r\nfrom the hill above. Expecting no doubt to ‘drag some struggling savage\r\ninto day’ he reached as far into the opening as the length of his arm,\r\nand drew out, to his surprise, one of the long bones of a human\r\nskeleton. His curiosity being excited he then began to dig a trench\r\nthrough the middle of the talus, and in a few hours found himself\r\nopposite a large heavy slab of rock, placed vertically against the\r\nentrance. Having removed this, he discovered on the other side of it an\r\narched cavity almost filled with bones, among which were two entire\r\nskulls, which he recognised at once as human.\r\n\r\nThe good people of Aurignac, highly interested in the discovery, flocked\r\nto the cave, and as they probably expressed a wish to see the bones of\r\nwhat they supposed to be their forefathers enjoy a Christian burial, the\r\nmayor ordered these human relics to be removed from the lonely spot in\r\nwhich they had so long reposed in peace, and to be re-interred in the\r\nparish cemetery. But before this was done—having, as a medical man, a\r\nknowledge of anatomy, though, as it seems, a very imperfect idea of the\r\nethnological value of the discovery—he ascertained that the bones must\r\nhave formed parts of no less than seventeen skeletons of both sexes.\r\nUnfortunately, the skulls were injured in the transfer, and the\r\ninterment was so negligently conducted that when, after the lapse of\r\neight years, M. Lartet visited Aurignac, even the place could not be\r\npointed out into which the skeletons had been thrown.\r\n\r\nThe eminent antiquary, however, resolved systematically to investigate\r\nthe ground inside and outside the vault, and, having obtained the\r\nassistance of some intelligent workmen, made the following interesting\r\ndiscoveries, which amply rewarded him for his trouble. Outside the\r\ngrotto, he found a layer of ashes and charcoal, about six inches thick,\r\nextending over an area of six or seven square yards, and going no\r\nfurther than the entrance of the cave, there being no cinders or\r\ncharcoal in the interior. Among the ashes were fragments of sandstone,\r\nreddened by heat, which had once formed a hearth, not fewer than a\r\nhundred flint articles, and knives, projectiles, sling-stones, and\r\nchips. Here also lay scattered the bones of various animals, some\r\nbelonging to species extinct for thousands of years in France, such as\r\nthe mammoth, the Siberian rhinoceros, the reindeer, and the gigantic\r\nIrish deer; and among these bones those which had contained marrow were\r\ninvariably split open, as if for its extraction, many of them being also\r\nburnt. The spongy parts, moreover, were wanting, having been eaten off\r\nand gnawed after they were broken—the work, according to M. Lartet, of\r\nhyenas, whose bones and coprolites were mixed with the cinders and\r\ndispersed through the overlying soil. These beasts of prey are supposed\r\nto have prowled about the spot, and fed on such relics of the funeral\r\nfeasts as remained after the retreat of the human visitors.\r\n\r\nIn the cave itself, along with some detached human bones which had\r\nescaped removal to the churchyard, were also found the bones of animals\r\nand some rude works of art, flat pieces of shell pierced through the\r\nmiddle as if for being strung into a bracelet, and the carved tusk of a\r\nyoung boar, perforated lengthwise as if for suspension as an ornament.\r\nThe bones of animals inside the vault differed in a remarkable manner\r\nfrom those of the exterior, as none of them were broken, gnawed, half-\r\neaten, or burnt, like those which were found lying among the ashes on\r\nthe other side of the great slab which formed the portal. They seemed\r\nalso to have been clothed with their flesh when buried in the layer of\r\nloose soil strewed over the floor, as they were often observed to be in\r\njuxtaposition, and in one spot all the bones of the leg of an _Ursus\r\nspelæus_ were lying together uninjured. When we consider that it is\r\nstill the custom of many savage tribes to bury with the bodies of the\r\ndead pieces of meat, such as the bear’s fat haunch, so that they may not\r\nlack food on their long journey to the land of spirits, we gain a most\r\ninteresting glimpse into the life of prehistoric man, the contemporary\r\nof the reindeer, the cave-bear, and the mammoth in the South of France.\r\nArmed with flint weapons, he had established his supremacy over the wild\r\nbeasts of the forest. Rude and ferocious as no doubt he was, he\r\ncarefully preserved the remains of his friends and kinsfolk, and\r\nperformed funeral feasts before the vaults in which their bodies were\r\ninterred.\r\n\r\nThe lower parts of the Valley of the Somme, far above Amiens and below\r\nAbbeville, as far as the sea, are covered with a bed of peat, in some\r\nplaces more than thirty feet thick. Near the surface of these moor\r\ngrounds Gallo-Roman remains have been found, and, still deeper, Celtic\r\nweapons of the stone period; but the thickness of the superincumbent\r\nvegetable matter is far inferior to that of the underlying peat, so that\r\nmany thousands of years must necessarily have passed since the first\r\ngrowth of that swampy vegetation. But, however remote its age, it is\r\nstill of later date than the adjoining or underlying alluvial deposits\r\nof clay, gravel, and sand, which cannot originally have ended abruptly\r\nas they do now, but must have once been continuous further towards the\r\ncentre of the valley. A long time must necessarily have elapsed between\r\ntheir deposition and subsequent denudation, and the first growth of the\r\npeat. In the lowest, and consequently oldest, of these beds, there has\r\nbeen found also a mixture of freshwater and marine shells, bones of the\r\nprimitive elephant and teichorhine rhinoceros, and a number of flint\r\nimplements shaped by the hands of man. Thus we have here convincing\r\nproofs that a race of savages inhabited the Valley of the Somme long\r\nbefore it was scooped out to its present depth, and when as yet not a\r\ntrace existed of the thick bed of peat which now covers its lower\r\ngrounds, and required so many thousand years for its formation.\r\n\r\nSimilar flint implements, in connexion with the bones of extinct\r\nanimals, have been disinterred from ancient drift formations in many\r\nparts of England—in Surrey, Middlesex, Kent, Bedfordshire, and Suffolk.\r\nIn the British Museum there is, among others, a flint spear-headed\r\nweapon which was found with an elephant’s tooth near Gray’s Inn Lane in\r\n1715.\r\n\r\nWhen, according to the old myth, Evander led Æneas over the site of\r\nfuture Rome, they saw the cattle grazing in what was to be the Forum,\r\nand heard them bellowing among the future dwellings of the rich senators\r\nand knights,\r\n\r\n               ——‘passimque armenta videbant\r\n               Romanoque Foro et lautis mugire Carinis.’\r\n\r\nThe change thus pointed out by Virgil was far less than that exemplified\r\nby these few relics of a time when possibly no intervening sea separated\r\nBritain from the rest of the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXI.\r\n              TROGLODYTES OR CAVE-DWELLERS—CANNIBAL CAVES.\r\n\r\nCave Dwellings in the Val d’Ispica—The Sicanians—Cannibal Caves in South\r\n  Africa—The Rock City of the Themud—Legendary Tale of its Destruction.\r\n\r\n\r\nCaves were probably the earliest habitations of primitive man, the first\r\nrude shelter for which he had to do battle with the hyena or the bear.\r\nAs we have seen in the preceding chapter, some of the oldest relics of\r\nhis prehistoric existence have been discovered in caves; and at a far\r\nlater period, when he had already made some progress in the arts, we\r\nfind many races still adhering to the subterranean dwellings of their\r\nforefathers. Such a state of things may possibly be indicated in the\r\nmythical stories of the Greek and Trojan heroes, who, near the base of\r\nMount Etna, are said to have found caverns tenanted by the troglodytic\r\ntribe of the Cyclops.\r\n\r\nIn another part of Sicily the old cave-dwellings of the Val d’Ispica\r\ndeservedly attract the antiquarian’s attention. The vale is a narrow\r\ngorge, situated between Modica and Spaccafurno; and throughout its whole\r\nlength of about eight Italian miles, the rock-walls on both sides are\r\npierced with innumerable grottoes, which at first sight might be taken\r\nfor the productions of nature, but on a closer inspection evidently show\r\nthat they are the work of man, and have been originally excavated to\r\nserve as dwellings. The luxuriant vegetation of the Val forms a pleasing\r\ncontrast with the naked sterility of the plain in which it is imbedded;\r\na small rivulet flows along the bottom, and irrigates wild fig-trees and\r\nstately oleanders; on a higher level grow broad-leaved acanthuses and\r\nwild artichokes, while thick festoons of cactus hang down from the top\r\nof the rocks and shade the entrance of the grottoes. These are excavated\r\nat various heights above the bottom of the vale, and often consist of\r\ntwo or three stories, one above the other. A great part of the rock-wall\r\non the right bank of the brook has fallen in, and exposes to sight the\r\ninternal arrangement of the dwellings. On the mounds of rubbish the\r\nvisitor is able to ascend to the entrances of the caves, which\r\noriginally can have been accessible only by ladders. The chambers are\r\nseldom more than twenty feet deep and six feet high and broad. The\r\nabove-mentioned rock-slip has laid open, among others, a dwelling of\r\nthree stories, with flights of steps in a good state of preservation, to\r\nwhich, on account of its superior dimensions, the neighbouring peasants\r\nhave given the name of Castello d’Ispica, and which may have been the\r\nabode of a chieftain.\r\n\r\nSeveral mortar-like basins or troughs, hollowed in the rock, evidently\r\nserved for the pounding of corn, so that the inhabitants, whoever they\r\nwere, must have known at least some of the arts of civilised life. A few\r\nof the rooms or burrows (for their size hardly warrants a better name)\r\nare still tenanted by shepherds, whose whole furniture consists of a\r\nkettle, a few pots, and some skins to lie upon. Parthey, a learned\r\nGerman traveller,[33] who visited many of the caves (the whole number\r\nprobably exceeding 1,500), nowhere found the least traces of ornament\r\nabout them; the doors and windows were mere rough holes broken through\r\nthe rock. Thus there can be no doubt that the fragments of painted vases\r\nand sculptured marble that have been found here and there in the caves\r\nbelong to a much later period, for a people sufficiently advanced in the\r\narts to paint vases and to chisel marble could not possibly have been\r\ncontent with a mole-like existence. If we seek to ascertain the probable\r\nage of this cavern city, all circumstances combine to throw back its\r\norigin to a very ancient date. The total want of artistic decoration at\r\nonce forbids us to assign these extensive but rude excavations to one of\r\nthe Greek tribes which successively founded colonies in the island after\r\nexpelling the aborigines from their ancestral seats. In the Roman, the\r\nSaracenic, or some later period a band of fugitives might indeed have\r\nfound a temporary retreat in this remote vale, but could hardly have\r\nremained concealed long enough to execute a work which evidently\r\nrequired long years of undisturbed toil. Thus it has been conjectured\r\nthat these caves were the dwellings of the ancient Sicanians, a people\r\nwho became known to history only when about to disappear for ever from\r\nthe stage of the world, having left no memorial of their existence save\r\nperhaps these rude vestiges of an infant state of society.\r\n\r\nFootnote 33:\r\n\r\n  ‘Wanderungen durch Sicilien.’\r\n\r\nWe may justly presume that the aborigines of Malta, the Balearic\r\nIslands, and Sardinia were likewise troglodytes when the first foreign\r\ncolonists landed on the shores of these islands. And such, after the\r\nlapse of more than thirty centuries, are the Sarde shepherds of the\r\npresent day, who frequently have no better dwellings than the caves of\r\nthe rocks.\r\n\r\nIn Southern Italy the traveller meets with traces of the same primitive\r\nmode of life. Near a place called Iscalonga, in the province of\r\nBasilicata Mr. Mallet found many inhabited caves, excavated in dry tufa\r\nof extreme antiquity. Some of the troglodytes came out to see him pass,\r\nand looked savage and queer enough in their rough brown blanket-cloaks,\r\nwith peaked hoods and sheepskins.\r\n\r\nIrrespective of climate, we at the present day find cave-dwellers among\r\nthe tribes of the frozen regions of the North and the Arabs of the stony\r\nwastes bordering on the Red Sea, in the Libyan deserts, and in the\r\nsandstone rocks of Southern Africa, wherever nature has formed grottoes\r\nor the soft material admits of an easy excavation.\r\n\r\nAmongst the many interesting objects of the Transgariep country are the\r\ncelebrated cannibal caverns which extend from the Moluta river to the\r\nCaledon river. Thirty years ago they were inhabited by a race of men\r\nwho, like the lion or the panther, were the scourge of the whole\r\nneighbouring country. Their mode of living was to send out hunting\r\nparties, who would conceal themselves among the rocks and bushes, and\r\nlie in ambush near roads, drifts, gardens, or watering-places for the\r\npurpose of surprising and capturing women, children, or travellers. The\r\ninfluence of the chieftain Moshesh induced them to change their evil\r\npractices for a better mode of life, and they are now said to be an\r\ninoffensive people of agriculturists and traders. When Mr. James Henry\r\nBowker visited the caves near the sources of the Caledon river, in 1868,\r\nhe met at one of them an old savage, one of the most ill-looking\r\nruffians he had ever beheld, who had formerly assisted at the cooking\r\nand bone-picking of many a human victim, and, like the Last Minstrel,\r\nseemed greatly to regret that\r\n\r\n                        ‘Old times were changed,\r\n                        Old manners gone;’\r\n\r\nand that\r\n\r\n                ‘The bigots of the iron time\r\n                Had called his _harmless life_ a crime.’\r\n\r\nThe largest cavern is situated amongst the mountains beyond Thaba\r\nBosigo, the residence of the old chief Moshesh, about ten miles distant\r\nfrom the deserted missionary station Cana. The entrance to this cavern\r\nis formed by the overhanging cliff, and its arched and lofty roof is\r\nblackened with the smoke and soot of the fires which served for the\r\npreparation of many a horrible repast. At the further end of the cave\r\nsome rough irregular steps led up to a gloomy-looking natural gallery\r\nwhere the victims not required for immediate consumption were confined.\r\nThe cannibals, consisting of Betshuana and Kafir tribes, had the less\r\nexcuse for their barbarity as they inhabit a fine agricultural country,\r\nwhich likewise abounds in game; but it is said that, having in a time of\r\nfamine been reduced to the horrible extremity of eating human flesh,\r\nthey acquired a taste for it, and continued to relish it as a delicacy\r\neven in times of abundance. Though they are now reported to be no longer\r\ncannibals, there is reason to fear that they have not yet entirely\r\nabandoned their diabolical way of living, for among the numerous bones\r\nwhich strewed the floor of the cavern and had chiefly belonged to\r\nchildren and young persons, Mr. Bowker found some that could hardly have\r\nbeen there many months. The skull of a child which lay before the mouth\r\nof the cavern afforded a touching example of ‘life in death,’ for a\r\nlittle bulb had sprung up from its cavity and covered it with a graceful\r\ntuft of drooping leaves.\r\n\r\nAt the distance of a ten days’ journey from Medina on the road of the\r\npilgrim caravans from Damascus, lies the deserted rock-city of the\r\nThemud, where a whole people had hewn their dwellings in the black rock,\r\ndecorating the entrances with small columns on both sides, and tracing\r\nnumerous inscriptions on the walls. No European traveller has ever\r\nvisited this curious spot, for the Bedouins render the neighbourhood\r\ninsecure, and the pilgrims to the holy cities allow no infidel to\r\naccompany them on their journey. How the subterranean city came to be\r\ndeserted is still a secret of the past; but probably its ruin must be\r\ntraced back as far as the first or second century of the Christian era,\r\nfor Mahomet cites it more than once in his Koran as a warning to all\r\ntrue believers. According to the legend the prophet Saleh once came to\r\nThemud to convert the idolatrous inhabitants to the belief of the one\r\ntrue God. As a proof of his divine mission they required a miracle to be\r\nperformed, upon which the prophet, raising his staff, struck the rock,\r\nwhich immediately opened and gave passage to a she-camel with its young.\r\nBut the obdurate pagans, still persisting in their incredulity, killed\r\nthe camel, and the young would no doubt have shared its mother’s fate,\r\nif it had not speedily retired into the rock whence it had come forth.\r\nThe sacrilegious crime of the Themud did not long remain unpunished. A\r\ndreadful earthquake destroyed them to the last man, and ever since the\r\nplace is cursed. When the caravan passes by, the pilgrims raise loud\r\nshouts and hurry along as fast as they can, fearful of their dromedaries\r\nbecoming shy from the wailings of the young camel, which is still\r\nsupposed to exist in the rock.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXII.\r\n                                TUNNELS.\r\n\r\nSubterranean London—The Mont Cenis Tunnel—Its Length—Ingenious Boring\r\n  Apparatus—The Grotto of the Pausilippo—The Tomb of Virgil.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most renowned subterranean works of previous ages are generally of a\r\nreligious character, as they have been executed to serve either as\r\nresting-places for the dead, or as temples in which gods or saints were\r\nworshipped. Thus the rock-tombs of the Egyptian Pharaohs and the sacred\r\ngrottoes of India still bear witness to the feelings which conceived and\r\nrealised the idea of these stupendous excavations.\r\n\r\nOur own times furnish no similar examples of underground temples or\r\nmausoleums on a scale so grand as to command the admiration of\r\nposterity. We neither scoop out whole mountains nor deeply plunge into\r\nthe entrails of the earth to reverence the dead or to testify our\r\ndevotion; our subterranean labours all bear the stamp of practical\r\nutility. But never yet has the genius of man executed such wondrous\r\nexcavations as those of the present day; and though the purposes for\r\nwhich they are performed may seem commonplace and prosaic when compared\r\nwith the ideal aims of the unknown artists who planned the Pharaonic\r\nrock-tombs, or the temples of Ellora, yet the boldness of their\r\nconception entitles them to rank among the grandest architectural works,\r\nwhile the difficulty of their execution would have appalled the most\r\nenterprising engineers of any age.\r\n\r\nModern London alone has more subterranean wonders to boast of than all\r\nthe capitals of the ancient world. As in the human frame numberless\r\nvessels and nerves provide for the circulation of the blood, and convey\r\ntelegraphic signals through every part, so in the vast body of our\r\nmetropolis an amazing system of subterranean communication carries off\r\nthe sewerage of its millions of inhabitants, provides them with light\r\nand water, conveys intelligence from one end to the other of its\r\nenormous circuit almost with the rapidity of thought, transports\r\nthousands of travellers below the crowded streets, and, not satisfied\r\nwith all these achievements, opens passages under the broad river to\r\nwhich it owes its boundless wealth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BORING MACHINE IN THE TUNNEL, MONT CENIS.]\r\n\r\nBut even the wonders of subterranean London, or of Paris—where troops\r\nmoving underground can march from one fortified caserne to the other, so\r\nthat, in a more literal sense than Pompey, the rulers of France can say\r\nthat they have but to stamp upon the ground to make legions start up\r\nfrom the soil—are surpassed by those which the railroad calls forth in\r\nits triumphal progress through the world. The Alps themselves, with\r\ntheir eternal snows, no longer oppose a barrier to the locomotive; and\r\nwe have lived to witness the completion of the most gigantic tunnel ever\r\nyet devised by man. The borer has slowly but indefatigably done its work\r\nin the entrails of Mont Cenis, and the subterranean junction of France\r\nand Italy has been at length achieved. The tunnel, which pierces 12,201\r\nmetres, or nearly seven miles, of solid rock, opens on the Italian side\r\nat Bardonneche, 1,291 metres (about 4,000 feet) above the level of the\r\nsea, and on the French side at Modane, at a height of 1,163 metres. From\r\neach opening the tunnel gently ascends towards its culminating point in\r\nthe centre of the mountain, so as to allow the waters to drain off on\r\neither side. The direction of the excavations was determined by\r\ntrigonometrical measurement, which of course required the nicest\r\naccuracy, as a deviation of but half a centimetre on both sides would\r\namount to no less than 120 metres in the centre.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BORING MACHINE IN THE SECOND WORKING GALLERY, MONT CENIS\r\nTUNNEL.]\r\n\r\nFor this purpose a signal was erected on the mountain above the\r\nculminating point or the centre of the tunnel; and opposite to each\r\nentrance, in the same longitudinal axis, a large theodolite pointed to\r\nthe above-mentioned signal and towards a light in the interior of the\r\ntunnel, so that the slightest deviation from the requisite direction was\r\nrendered mathematically impossible.\r\n\r\nThe machines used in the drivage of the tunnel were worked by means of\r\ncompressed air. The comminuted rock produced during the boring was\r\ncontinuously removed by a jet of water squirted into the hole by the\r\nmachine—a precaution which was found to be of great economy in the wear\r\nof the tools. Under ordinary conditions the working speed was about 200\r\nstrokes per minute, at which rate from eight to ten holes, of 1·6 inches\r\ndiameter and 35 inches deep, could be bored in the shift of six hours.\r\nThe tunnel is of an [18] section, 13 feet broad and 9¾ feet high; eight\r\nmachines were employed at one time; they were mounted on a wrought-iron\r\nframe, which travelled on a railway, and could be removed to a safe\r\ndistance when the blasting took place. From 65 to 70 holes were bored in\r\nthe face of the rock, and then loaded with uniform charges, made up into\r\ncartridges, and primed with fuses of different lengths, so as to explode\r\nin groups at definite intervals. A horizontal series at about mid height\r\nwas first fired, then followed two vertical side rows, then a group near\r\nthe crown of the arch, and finally a horizontal series near the floor.\r\nIn this way the rock was blown down in nearly uniform fragments of from\r\nsix to eight inches in the side. At first, owing to the hardness of the\r\nquartz-slate which had to be pierced, the work went on very slowly; but\r\nat a greater depth, the mountain was found to consist of limestone\r\nstrata, so that at length it advanced about thirteen feet per day.\r\n\r\nThe compressed air which set the borers in motion served also for the\r\nventilation of the tunnel, as every stroke of the piston liberated\r\nsufficient pure air to drive back to a considerable distance from the\r\nworkmen the suffocating gases, produced by the blasting, which otherwise\r\nwould render breathing impossible. Air-pumps placed before the entrance\r\nfinally conducted the fumes of the gunpowder or dynamite into the open\r\nair. It is evident that the difference in height of the two openings,\r\nand the gradual ascent towards the centre, will insure a thorough\r\nventilation. In the beginning of September 1869 the Italian side of the\r\ntunnel, which is 5,913 metres long, was completed, while on the French\r\nside only 4,222 metres were accomplished and 2056 remained to be bored,\r\nand it was calculated that this gigantic enterprise would most probably\r\nbe terminated by the beginning of 1871. It was, however, completed a few\r\ndays earlier.\r\n\r\nWhen Louis Quatorze, that model of regal pomposity, succeeded in placing\r\nthe crown of Spain on the head of his grandson Philip of Anjou, he bid\r\nhim grandiloquently farewell with the words: ‘Go, my son! the Pyrenees\r\nno longer exist.’ With more truth is our age able now to declare that\r\nthe Alps have ceased to be a barrier between nations.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that the Mont Cenis tunnel will soon be followed\r\nby similar undertakings, some probably on a still grander scale. The\r\ngovernments of Italy, Switzerland, and Germany have already decided upon\r\npiercing a tunnel through the Mount St. Gothard. In winter the traveller\r\nwill no longer be obliged to ascend the solitudes of the Schöllenen, to\r\ncross the Devil’s Bridge, and then, after traversing the valley of\r\nUrseren, to pursue his perilous way up to the summit of the pass, before\r\na zigzag descent, along yawning precipices, leads him into the sunny\r\nvale of the Ticino; but at Göschenen on the north he will plunge at once\r\ninto the bowels of the mountain, and in an hour will suddenly emerge at\r\nAirilo into the genial south. In early spring the change of climate will\r\nbe almost miraculous; on one side winter still reigning supreme, the\r\nearth covered with deep snow and the cold wind moaning through the\r\nleafless trees—and then, after a short interval of darkness, the rich\r\nvegetation of an Italian vale bursting forth in all its first\r\nluxuriance, birds singing in the chestnut groves, and the green meads\r\nenamelled with myriads of flowers.\r\n\r\nIt is curious to compare these stupendous works with the most celebrated\r\ntunnel of ancient times, the Grotto of the Pausilippo, near Naples,\r\nwhich serves as a passage for the travellers who intend visiting\r\nPuzzuoli, Baiæ, or Cumæ, without being obliged to ascend the mountain or\r\nto cross the bay. It is about a mile long, from thirty to eighty feet\r\nhigh and twenty-eight feet broad, so as to allow three carriages to pass\r\nabreast. Twice a year, in February and October, the last rays of the sun\r\ndart for a few minutes through the whole length of the grotto; at all\r\nother times a speck of gray uncertain light terminates the long and\r\nsolemn perspective. The origin of this celebrated grotto is unknown.\r\nSome old chroniclers have imagined it as ancient as the Trojan war;\r\nothers attribute it to the mysterious race of the Cimmerians.\r\n\r\nThe Neapolitans attribute a more modern, though not more certain, origin\r\nto their famous cavern, and most piously believe it to have been formed\r\nby the enchantments of Virgil, who, as Addison very justly observes, is\r\nbetter known at Naples in his magical character than as the author of\r\nthe ‘Æneid.’ This strange infatuation most probably arose from the fact\r\nthat the tomb, in which his ashes are supposed to have been deposited,\r\nis situated above the grotto, and that, according to popular tradition,\r\nit was guarded by those very spirits who assisted in constructing the\r\ncave. King Robert, a wise, though far from poetical, monarch, conducted\r\nhis friend Petrarch with great solemnity to the spot, and, pointing to\r\nthe entrance of the grotto, very gravely asked him whether he did not\r\nadopt the general belief, and conclude that this stupendous passage\r\nderived its origin from Virgil’s powerful incantations.\r\n\r\n‘When I had sat for some time,’ says Beckford,[34] ‘on a loose stone\r\nimmediately beneath the first gloomy arch of the grotto, contemplating\r\nthe dusky avenue, and trying to persuade myself that it was hewn by the\r\nCimmerians, I retreated, without proceeding any further, and followed a\r\nnarrow path which led me, after some windings and turnings, along the\r\nbrink of the precipice, across a vineyard, to that retired nook of the\r\nrocks which shelters Virgil’s tomb, most venerably mossed over and more\r\nthan half concealed by bushes and vegetation. The clown who conducted me\r\nremained aloof at awful distance whilst I sat communing with the manes\r\nof my beloved poet, or straggled about the shrubbery which hangs\r\ndirectly above the mouth of the grot.\r\n\r\nFootnote 34:\r\n\r\n  ‘Italy.’\r\n\r\n‘Advancing to the edge of the rock, I saw crowds of people and\r\ncarriages, diminished by distance, issuing from the bosom of the\r\nmountain, and disappearing almost as soon as discovered in the windings\r\nof the road. Clambering high above the cavern, I hazarded my neck on the\r\ntop of one of the pines, and looked contemptuously down on the race of\r\npigmies that were so busily moving to and fro. The sun was fiercer than\r\nI could have wished, but the sea breezes fanned me in my aërial\r\nsituation, which commanded the grand sweep of the bay, varied by\r\nconvents, palaces, and gardens, mixed with huge masses of rock, and\r\ncrowned by the stately buildings of the Carthusians and fortress of St.\r\nElmo. Add a glittering blue sea to this perspective, with Caprea rising\r\nfrom its bosom, and Vesuvius breathing forth a white column of smoke\r\ninto the æther, and you will then have a scene upon which I gazed with\r\ndelight for more than an hour, forgetting that I was perched upon the\r\nhead of a pine with nothing but a frail branch to uphold me. However, I\r\ndescended alive, as Virgil’s genii, I am resolved to believe, were my\r\nprotectors.’\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXIII.\r\n                          ON MINES IN GENERAL.\r\n\r\nPerils of the Miner’s Life—Number of Casualties in British and Foreign\r\n  Coal Mines—Life in a Mine—Occurrence of Ores—Extent and Depth of\r\n  Metallic Veins—Mines frequently discovered by Chance—The Divining Rod—\r\n  Experimental Borings—Stirring Emotions during their Progress—Sinking\r\n  of Shafts—Precautions against Influx of Water—Expense—Shaft Accidents—\r\n  Various Methods of working Mineral Substances—Working in Direct and\r\n  Reverse Steps—Working by Transverse Attacks—Open Quarry Workings—\r\n  Pillar and Stall System—Long Wall System—Dangerous Extraction of\r\n  Pillars—Mining Implements—Blasting—Heroes in Humble Life—Firing in the\r\n  Mine of Rammelsberg—Transport of Minerals Underground—Modern\r\n  Improvements—Various Modes of Descent—Corfs—Wonderful Preservation of\r\n  a Girl at Fahlun—The Loop—Safety Cage—Man Machines—Timbering and\r\n  Walling of Galleries—Drainage by Adit Levels—Remarkable Adits—The\r\n  Great Cornish Adit—The Georg Stollen in the Harz—The Ernst August\r\n  Stollen—Steam Pumps—Drowning of Mines—Irruption of the Sea into\r\n  Workington Colliery—Hubert Goffin—Irruption of the River Garnock into\r\n  a Mine—Ventilation of Mines—Upcast Shafts—Fire Damp—Dreadful\r\n  Explosions—The Safety Lamp—The Choke Damp—Conflagrations of Mines—The\r\n  Burning Hill in Staffordshire.\r\n\r\n\r\nFew metals are found in a native state, nor are they commonly scattered\r\nin loose masses, nuggets, grains, or scales over the surface of the\r\nearth. Hence the seeker’s trouble is by no means confined to the task of\r\ngathering these masses, or of separating them by washing from the\r\nalluvial sand or gravel with which they are mixed; much more frequently\r\nthey are chemically combined with other substances from which a far\r\nadvanced state of science is alone able to separate them, or deeply\r\nimbedded in subterranean mines, often so difficult of access as to tax\r\nfor their working all the energies of man and all the resources of his\r\nmetallurgic skill. The labours of the miner require indeed no less\r\ncourage and presence of mind than those of the mariner. He no more knows\r\nwhether he shall ever return from the pit into which he descends in the\r\nmorning for his hard day’s work than the sailor knows whether he shall\r\never revisit the port which he is leaving. He is perpetually at war with\r\nfire and earth, with air and water, and this eternal strife levies a no\r\nless heavy tribute of death and suffering than the storms of the raging\r\nseas.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1867, 1,190 persons perished in our 3,192 collieries, which\r\nemploy a total of 333,116 workmen. Of these, 286 were killed by\r\nexplosions; 449 by falls of rock; 211 by other subterranean causes; 156\r\nin the shafts; and 88 above ground. In the same year, 293 lives were\r\nlost in the Prussian collieries, where 102,773 workmen find employment.\r\nOf these, 39 perished by fire-damp; 106 by fall of roof; 65 in shafts;\r\n74 by casualties under ground; and 9 by casualties above ground. These\r\nmelancholy lists may give us some idea of the number of serious but non-\r\nfatal accidents which are not mentioned in the official accounts. Every\r\nvisitor to a coal-mine will meet with many pit lads who have been\r\n‘lamed’ (or injured) several times in a few years, and who reckon events\r\nby the mournful chronology of their various ‘lamings.’ Collieries, as\r\nwill be seen in the sequel, are indeed peculiarly liable to frightful\r\naccidents; yet the number of lives lost in the inspected ironstone mines\r\nof Great Britain, in 1866, amounted to 81. Extending our view to the\r\nmines of Austria and Russia, of France and Belgium, of Mexico and Peru,\r\n&c., &c., where the same dangers cause, no doubt, an equal amount of\r\ndeath or suffering, we may justly conclude that not a day, probably not\r\nan hour, passes that does not doom more than one miner to an untimely\r\ngrave or to permanent mutilation.\r\n\r\nBut if mining is attended with a lamentable amount of individual\r\nsuffering, the benefits derived from it by mankind in general are so\r\nimportant that the whole fabric of modern civilisation may be said to\r\nrest upon its basis.\r\n\r\nCoal and the useful metals rule the world. Wherever they occur in large\r\nmasses they establish the prosperity of a people on the surest\r\nfoundations; and England is in a great measure indebted for her high\r\nstation among the nations of the earth to the treasures hidden beneath\r\nher soil.\r\n\r\nA large mine displays unquestionably some of the most interesting scenes\r\nof human activity. The restless industry pervading its subterranean\r\ncaves and galleries impresses the visitor with feelings of wonder akin\r\nto those which he experiences when he first sets foot on a man-of-war;\r\nand if he feels giddy on seeing the sailor climb the loftiest masts, the\r\nsight of the yawning abyss into which the miner undauntedly descends\r\nseems terrible to his unaccustomed eye; and as he penetrates further and\r\nfurther into the recesses of this unknown world, his sensations are not\r\nrendered more agreeable.\r\n\r\nThe intricate passages branching out into a mysterious distance; the\r\nvaults and high halls faintly illumined here and there by a glimmering\r\nlamp; the dark forms emerging every now and then from some obscure\r\nrecess, and then again plunging into night, like demon shades; the\r\nclanking of hammers, the rushing of waters, the creaking of wheels, the\r\nmonotonous sound of machinery, or the loud explosion which, repeated by\r\nsubterranean echoes, rolls like muttering thunder from vault to vault,\r\nthe oppressive air in the low galleries, through which he can only move\r\nin a stooping position; the fear of being crushed any moment by a\r\nfalling rock, or shivered to atoms by fire-damp combustion,—all combine\r\nto produce an impression which can seldom be made by any scenes above\r\nground.\r\n\r\nThe admiration which this imposing spectacle necessarily calls forth in\r\nhis mind increases when he reflects how much skill and experience was\r\nrequired, and how many improvements and inventions had to be made,\r\nbefore mining could be brought to its present state of perfection.\r\n\r\nOres sometimes occur, like coal, in layers or beds, running parallel\r\nwith the strata of the inclosing rocks, or in prodigious irregular\r\nmasses. Most commonly, however, they are found in veins traversing the\r\nrocks in every conceivable direction, and filling the crevices and\r\nchasms which former terrestrial revolutions have rent in the hard stone.\r\nFrom the wild and titanic powers that have here been at work, it may\r\neasily be imagined how irregular the direction of these veins must be,\r\nand under how many various forms they must appear. Here they are\r\nhorizontal, there vertical; here they form thin layers, there they fill\r\nchasms several hundred feet thick. Sometimes they split into several\r\nminor branches, or make abrupt bends, and frequently they have been\r\nrent, torn, or displaced in every possible manner by subsequent\r\nrevolutions.\r\n\r\nTheir length is as various as their thickness or their direction. Some\r\nare short, while others traverse the rocks to a distance of many miles.\r\nThus the argentiferous veins in the neighbourhood of Clausthal, in the\r\nHarz, are three leagues long, and the famous Veta Madre, or chief lode\r\nof Guanaxuato in Mexico, has been traced for a length of eight miles.\r\n\r\nWith regard to depth, the lower extremity of hardly a single mineral bed\r\nor vein of any note has as yet been pointed out, though many have been\r\nworked to a considerable depth. Thus, one of the pits of St.\r\nAndreasberg, in the Harz, is 2,485 feet deep, though, on account of its\r\nhigh situation in the mountains, not much more than 280 feet below the\r\nsurface of the sea, while, in the coal mines of Valenciennes and Liège,\r\nthe deepest shafts are sunk from 1,300 to 1,600 feet below the level of\r\nthe ocean. The shaft of the colliery of Sacrée Madame, near Charleroi,\r\nis 800 yards deep, and that of Dukinfield Colliery 2,050 feet.\r\n\r\nThe great difficulty of carrying on mining operations at great depths\r\nwill, probably, for ever prevent most metalliferous veins from being\r\nfollowed to their origin in the bowels of the earth; for while on high\r\nmountains the rarefaction of the atmosphere prevents respiration, the\r\nincreasing pressure or impurity of the air at a depth of four or five\r\nthousand feet below the level of the sea must necessarily hinder the\r\nfree expansion of the lungs. The weakness of our organisation soon sets\r\nlimits to our progress, whether we wish to rise into the air or to\r\npenetrate into the interior of the earth; and it is only on spiritual\r\nwings that we soar aloft to the stars, or wander through the mysterious\r\ndepths of our planet.\r\n\r\nHow have the ores been collected or precipitated in the veins or strata\r\nwhere they are often found in such enormous quantities? Partly they\r\nascended as vapour from unknown depths, and then were condensed in the\r\ncrevices, mixing with the gangue or the stones which filled the volcanic\r\nchasms; and partly their solutions, of which the mineral springs of the\r\npresent day afford us so many examples, permeated the porous rocks, and\r\nsaturated them on cooling, or were forced to relinquish their valuable\r\ncontents by some more powerful chemical affinity. Thus, numberless years\r\nbefore man appeared upon the stage of his future empire, the means were\r\nprovided without which it would never have been possible for him to\r\nestablish his dominion over the earth, and to make himself master of the\r\ntreasures it bears on its surface.\r\n\r\nWhen we consider the frequent upheavings and subsidences of the earth-\r\nrind and the denuding power of water, which, in the long series of ages,\r\ncuts deep ravines into the mountains and washes away whole strata, we\r\ncannot wonder that many metalliferous veins emerge or crop out on the\r\nsurface of the earth, so that a fortunate chance sufficed for their\r\ndiscovery. Thus, a poor Indian looking for wood first found the rich\r\ndeposits of silver that had so long been buried in obscurity under the\r\nsterile soil of Copiapo in Chili (1632). Partridges, in whose stomachs\r\ngrains of gold were found, are said to have led to the discovery of the\r\nrich mines of Kremnitz and Schemnitz in Hungary; and Ramm, a huntsman of\r\nthe emperor Otho the Great, having bound his horse to a tree in a forest\r\nnear Goslar in the Harz Mountains, the fretful steed, stamping with\r\nimpatience and tearing up the soil, pointed out the celebrated lode of\r\nthe Rammelsberg, which is still worked to the present day.\r\n\r\nBut if in these and similar instances the treasures of the subterranean\r\nworld have revealed themselves spontaneously to man, in many other cases\r\nlaborious and costly investigations have been found necessary for their\r\ndiscovery.\r\n\r\nAs civilisation advanced, and the value of the metals, of coal and salt,\r\ncame to be more and more appreciated, nothing could be more natural than\r\nthe desire of no longer relying upon the discoveries of chance or upon\r\nthe mines bequeathed by former ages, but of sounding the mysterious\r\nrecesses of the earth, and forcing her, by dint of patient exploration,\r\nto reveal the riches she conceals under her surface.\r\n\r\nThus, as far back as the eleventh century, the _divining_ rod came into\r\npractice, and found full credence in a superstitious age. A forked\r\nbranch of the hazel-tree, cut during a peculiar phase of the moon, was\r\nthe means employed in Germany for the discovery of buried treasures, of\r\nveins of metal, of deposits of salt, or of subterranean sources. But the\r\nmiraculous rod did not indiscriminately show its powers in every hand;\r\nit was necessary to have been born in certain months, and soft and warm—\r\nor, according to the modern expression, _magnetic_—fingers were\r\nindispensable for handling it with effect. The diviner possessing these\r\nnecessary qualifications took hold of the rod by its branches so that\r\nthe stem into which they united was directed upwards. On approaching the\r\nspot where the sought-for treasure lay concealed, the magical rod slowly\r\nturned towards it, until finally the stem had fully changed its position\r\nand pointed vertically downwards. To increase the solemnity of the\r\nscene, the wily conjurors generally traced magical circles that were not\r\nto be passed, burnt strong smelling herbs and spices, and uttered\r\npowerful charms to disarm the enmity of the evil spirits that were\r\nsupposed to guard the hidden treasures.\r\n\r\nAt present, the divining-rod has lost its old reputation, and more\r\nrational means are employed for the discovery of mineral wealth. Relying\r\non experience, tact, and geological knowledge, the investigator\r\ncarefully examines the country where ores or coal are supposed to be\r\nconcealed, and having fixed upon an appropriate spot, has recourse\r\neither to experimental digging or to boring for testing the truth of his\r\nopinion. These expensive explorations, though often unsuccessful,\r\nfrequently prove highly remunerative, and many a saline spring, or coal\r\nseam, or metallic vein would, without their assistance, have remained\r\nunknown and unproductive.\r\n\r\nBoring through hard stone is necessarily a very tedious work, but as it\r\nproceeds it awakens not only in those who are directly interested in its\r\nsuccess, but in every intelligent witness, all the stirring emotions of\r\na game of chance. ‘Of all branches of business,’ says Williams, a\r\nthoroughly devoted miner—‘of all the experiments that a man of\r\nsensibility can be engaged in, or attend to, there is, perhaps, none so\r\namusing, so engaging, and delightful as a successful trial upon the\r\nvestigia, or appearances, of a seam of coal, or other mineral\r\ndiscoveries. When you are attending the people who are digging down or\r\nforward upon the vestige of the coal, and the indications are increasing\r\nand still growing better under your eye, the spirit of curiosity and\r\nattention is awakened, and all the powers of expectation are elevated in\r\npleasing hopes of success. And when your wishes are at length actually\r\nfulfilled—when you have discovered a good coal of sufficient thickness,\r\nand all circumstances are favourable, the heart then triumphs with solid\r\nand satisfactory joy.'\r\n\r\nIn a mining country like England, where the spirit of enterprise is\r\ncontinually on the look-out for new sources of profit, it may naturally\r\nbe supposed that searches for coal or metallic ore must be frequently\r\nundertaken. Thus in all our mining districts there are professional\r\nmaster-borers, who engage for a fixed price to drill the hardest rock to\r\nany depth that may be required.[35] Their chief implements are boring-\r\nrods, made of the best and most tenacious Swedish iron; chisels fitted\r\nwith screws, tipped with good steel, with a face of two and a half to\r\nthree and a quarter inches, and generally eighteen inches in length; and\r\na wimble, which is a hollow iron instrument like an auger, whose cavity\r\nis from six to ten inches in length, with an opening up at one side,\r\nwith partial overlap, the better to receive and hold the chopped strata.\r\n\r\nFootnote 35:\r\n\r\n  In the North of England the prices of boring in the ordinary strata of\r\n  that coal-field are as follows:—\r\n\r\n                                        _s._ _d._\r\n\r\n              First five fathoms           5 6 per\r\n                                             fathom.\r\n\r\n              Second five      ”          11 0      ”\r\n\r\n              Third five       ”          16 6      ”\r\n\r\n              Fourth five      ”          22 0      ”\r\n\r\n  and so increasing 5_s._ 6_d._ per fathom on each succeeding depth of\r\n  five fathoms. In boring through very hard strata the prices are from\r\n  80 to 100 per cent. higher.\r\n\r\nWhen the bore is intended to penetrate to a considerable depth, a lofty\r\ntriangle of wood is set above the bore-hole. In boring, the lowermost\r\nrod is the chisel, which continually operates on the rock or stratum.\r\nThe uppermost rod terminates in a stout ring, through which passes a\r\ncross-piece held by two men in working, and which is also suspended to a\r\nspringing pole by a chain. One or more rods being pushed into the\r\nground, two men on a wooden stage take hold of a cross stave at the end\r\nof the springing pole and work it steadily up and down, while two men\r\nbelow, by means of the cross-piece, at the same time heave the suspended\r\nrods a few inches, and then allow them to fall by their own weight,\r\nwalking slowly round the hole. By these combined operations of chopping\r\nand scooping the workmen make slow but sure way through whatever\r\nsubstance may be in contact with the chisel. When the hole is too deep,\r\nand the added rods become too heavy to be conveniently lifted by manual\r\nlabour, a brake or lever, or a horse-gin or steam-engine, is employed.\r\nAs the boring proceeds, it is also frequently necessary to lower pipes\r\ninto the hole made, to prevent the falling of fragments from the sides\r\nof the cylinder.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PROCESS OF BORING.]\r\n\r\nWhen the position of a mineral vein is ascertained, its direction known,\r\nand some reasonable conjecture made concerning its extent, thickness,\r\nand value, measures must be taken to obtain, by subterraneous\r\nexcavation, the buried mineral, and for this purpose vertical pits or\r\nshafts must be sunk, and horizontal galleries, or, as they are sometimes\r\ncalled, _levels_, must be driven, to prepare the way for its convenient\r\nextraction, and at the same time to carry off, so far as may be, the\r\nwater which either rises into the mine from springs, or drains into it\r\nfrom the surrounding strata. Some idea may be formed of the extent of\r\nthese works in many of the more considerable mines, when we learn that\r\nthe total amount of sinking in the Consolidated Mines in Cornwall is\r\nstated to amount to more than twelve miles of perpendicular depth\r\n(including, of course, the winzes or underground shafts), and that the\r\nhorizontal galleries extend to as much as forty miles in length. A mine\r\nlike this is, in fact, a large subterranean town, with numerous lanes\r\nand avenues, passages and thoroughfares.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  SECTION OF A LEAD MINE IN CARDIGANSHIRE.\r\n  _a._ Shafts. _b._ Levels.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn sinking a shaft, danger is to be apprehended both from the falling in\r\nof loose and incoherent strata, and from the lateral springs, which\r\nsometimes empty themselves into the workings to an extent which it would\r\nat first appear hopeless to contend against. In such cases there is no\r\nsafety to be obtained without walling the shaft with brick or stone, or\r\nsecuring it by timber or metal tubbing. For this purpose many of our\r\ncoal pits were formerly lined throughout with three-inch boards, nailed\r\nto a circular wooden framework called a crib, which was firmly attached\r\nto the sides of the pit at convenient distances. But this method,\r\nalthough it has been known to keep out a pressure of water equal to 100\r\npounds on the square inch, is not considered so safe as the metal\r\ntubbing now adopted in all difficult works. In comparatively solid\r\nground the cast-iron tubs are forced down the shaft, but in soft ground\r\nthey sink by their own weight. As they descend, fresh tubs are added,\r\nuntil the work is finished. When we consider that, in the coal-pits in\r\nthe north of England, many shafts have a diameter of as much as fifteen\r\nfeet, that in some cases they are sunk to a depth of nearly 300 fathoms,\r\nand that, under the most favourable circumstances, even where tubbing is\r\nnot required to guard against the influx of springs, it is necessary to\r\nline almost the whole of the interior with bricks, to prevent the loose\r\nstrata from falling or being washed in, we cannot wonder that as much as\r\n100,000l. and ten years of labour have, in some cases, been expended\r\nbefore the seam of coal has been reached that was to repay all this vast\r\noutlay of capital and time. Unsightly and filthy as such a shaft may be,\r\nit is in reality a great triumph of architectural skill.\r\n\r\nIn most of our collieries one shaft serves for winding up the coal, for\r\nthe passage of the men up and down, for ventilation, and for drainage by\r\nmeans of the engine-pumps. To answer these various purposes it is\r\nsubdivided or bratticed by brick or wooden partitions into two, three,\r\nor four compartments; but this arrangement is very defective, for the\r\nsafety of the workmen requires that in every large coal-pit, and indeed\r\nin every mine, there should be at least two separate shafts. When the\r\npartitions of the single shaft become injured or burnt, which has not\r\nunfrequently been the case, the ventilation of the pit may suddenly be\r\nderanged, and many lives have thus been endangered. The obstruction of a\r\nshaft by the breakage of an engine has caused some of the most appalling\r\ntragedies in mining history. On January 10, 1862, the beam of the\r\npumping engine broke at the Hartley Colliery in the Newcastle coalfield,\r\nand striking, like a huge catapult, with its enormous weight of forty\r\ntons, against the sides of the shaft as it descended, accumulated an\r\nenormous mass of rubbish and broken timbers at the depth of 138 yards\r\nfrom the surface. Two hundred and four colliers were thus shut out from\r\nall hope of rescue, for no exertion could possibly remove, in time\r\nenough to save them, the vast pile of ruins that obstructed their escape\r\nto the upper world.\r\n\r\nThe methods of working, winning, or excavating mineral substances\r\nnaturally vary, according to the magnitude and direction of the beds,\r\nlodes, or seams in which they are contained. With a vein of moderate\r\nwidth, as soon as the preparatory labours have brought the miners to the\r\npoint of the vein from which the ulterior workings are to ramify, the\r\nfirst object is to divide the mass of ore into solid rectangular\r\ncompartments by means of oblong galleries, generally pierced ten fathoms\r\nbelow one another, with pits of communication opened up, thirty, forty,\r\nor fifty yards asunder, which follow the slope of the vein. These\r\ngalleries and shafts are usually of the same breadth as the vein, unless\r\nwhen it is very narrow, in which case it is necessary to cut out a\r\nportion of the roof or the floor. Such workings serve at once the\r\npurposes of mining, by affording a portion of ore, and for the complete\r\ninvestigation of the nature and riches of the vein, a certain extent of\r\nwhich is thus prepared before removing the cubical masses. It is proper\r\nto advance first of all in this manner to the greatest distance from the\r\ncentral point which can be mined with economy, and afterwards to remove\r\nthe rectangular blocks in working back to that point. This latter\r\noperation may be carried on in two different ways, by attacking the ore\r\nfrom above or from below. In either case the excavations are disposed in\r\nsteps, similar to a stair, upon their upper or under side. The first is\r\nstyled a working in _direct_ or descending steps; the second a working\r\nin reverse, or ascending steps. By this method a number of miners are\r\nable to proceed simultaneously without interfering with each other.\r\n\r\nIn rich lodes and in the case of thick masses, the system of working in\r\nlarge chambers or extensive excavations, or by transverse attacks, is\r\nemployed. Superficial deposits are worked like open quarries.\r\n\r\nIn British practice, coal is generally worked on the post (or pillar and\r\nstall) system, or on the long-wall system.\r\n\r\nThe pillar and stall principle is carried out in the working away of a\r\ncertain portion of the coal as a first measure, and in leaving the\r\nremainder in pillars, which are either to serve permanently for the\r\nsupport of the roof, or to be at some future time partially or totally\r\nremoved. In the North of England, where this system has been brought to\r\nperfection, it is also named panel-work, because the whole area is\r\ndivided into quadrangular panels, each panel containing an area of from\r\neight to twelve acres, and round each panel is at first left a solid\r\nwall of coal of from forty to fifty yards thick. Through the panel walls\r\nroads and air-courses are driven in order to work the coal contained\r\nwithin these walls. Thus all the panels are connected together with the\r\nshaft as to roads and ventilation, and each district or panel has a\r\nparticular name, so that any circumstance relating to the details of the\r\ncolliery can be readily referred to a specified place.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PART OF A COLLIERY LAID OUT IN FOUR PANELS.]\r\n\r\n       A.

The rise or crop gallery.       H. Panel fully worked out.\r\n\r\n    K, K. Panel walls.\r\n\r\nBy this plan, of which the above illustration gives a distinct idea, the\r\npillars of a panel may be worked out at any time most suitable for the\r\neconomy of the mine, and the loss of coal amounts to no more than about\r\na tenth, instead of a third or a half by the old methods.\r\n\r\nWhen the pillars of a panel are to be worked out, the most distant range\r\nis first attacked, and as the workmen cut away the furthest pillars,\r\nprops of wood are placed between the pavement and the roof, within a few\r\nfeet of each other, as shown by the dots at I. This is continued till an\r\narea of one hundred square yards is cleared of pillars. This operation\r\nis termed ‘working the _goaf_.’ The only use of the prop-wood is to\r\nprevent the stratum which forms the ceiling over the workmen’s heads\r\nfrom falling down and killing them by its splintery fragments.\r\nExperience has proved that before proceeding to take away another set of\r\npillars, it is necessary to allow the last made goaf to fall. The\r\nworkmen then begin to draw out the props. This is a most hazardous\r\nemployment. Knocking down the more remote props one after another, they\r\nquickly retreat under the protection of the remaining props. Meanwhile\r\nthe roof stratum begins to break by the sides of the pillars and falls\r\ndown in immense pieces; while the workmen still persevere, boldly\r\ndrawing and retreating till every prop is removed. Nay, should any props\r\nbe so firmly fixed by the top pressure that they will not give way to\r\nthe blows of heavy mauls, they are cut through with axes, the workmen\r\nmaking it a point of honour to leave not a single prop in the goaf. If\r\nany props are left, it causes an irregular subsidence of the strata, and\r\nthrows more pressure on the adjacent pillars. The miners next proceed to\r\ncut away the pillars nearest to the sides of the goaf, setting prop-\r\nwood, then drawing it, and retreating as before, until every panel is\r\nremoved excepting small portions of pillars which require to be left\r\nunder dangerous stones, to protect the retreat of the workmen. While\r\nthis operation is going forward and the goaf extending, the\r\nsuperincumbent strata, being exposed without support over a larger area,\r\nbreak progressively higher up; and when strong beds of sandstone are\r\nthus giving way, the noise of the rending rocks is very peculiar and\r\nterrific; at one time loud and sharp, at another hollow and deep. As the\r\npillars of the panels are taken away, the panel walls are also worked\r\nprogressively backwards to the pit-bottom, so that only a small portion\r\nof the coal is eventually lost.\r\n\r\nWhen mines are fully worked, the main shaft is frequently continued down\r\nto other seams of coal, which are excavated in the same way as the first\r\nseam. In such cases the workings communicate with each other by shafts\r\ncalled ‘staples,’ which are sunk at intervals between the seams of coal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GENERAL VIEW OF MINING OPERATIONS.]\r\n\r\nThe principle of long-wall working (Shropshire and Derbyshire method) is\r\nthe extraction of all the available coal by the single process of first\r\nworking, maintaining the roads by means of stone-walls or wooden props.\r\nThis system is applicable with advantage only to thin seams which lie\r\nnear to the surface, and in which the workings may be of a very limited\r\nextent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  TOOLS USED BY MINERS IN CORNWALL.\r\n  _a._ Pick. _b._ Gad. _c._ Shovel. _d._ Mallet. _e._ Borer. _f._\r\n    Claying-bar. _g._ Needle or nail. _h._ Scraper. _i._ Tamping-bar.\r\n]\r\n\r\nAccording to the various hardness of the minerals or of the rocks in\r\nwhich they are embedded, different means and implements for dividing the\r\nmasses are employed. In loose earth, sand, and clay, shovels and\r\nscrapers suffice; in gypsum, coal, and rock-salt, the pick becomes\r\nnecessary; in many hard slates, gads must be driven into the small\r\nopenings made with the point of the pick. In still harder stones,\r\nforming the great majority of those which occur in veins and strata,\r\nrecourse must be had to the explosive power of gunpowder, which is also\r\nlargely employed in our coal-mines. The tools used for this purpose are\r\nthe borer, an iron bar tipped with steel, formed like a thick chisel,\r\nwhich is held by one man straight in the hole with constant rotation on\r\nits axis, while another strikes the head of it with the iron sledge or\r\nmallet; the scraper for clearing out the hole from time to time; the\r\nclaying-bar, a tapering iron rod, which, after the introduction of some\r\ntenacious clay into the cavity, is forced into it with great violence,\r\nand, condensing the clay into all the crevices of the rock, secures the\r\ndryness of the hole; and the nail, a small taper rod of copper, which,\r\nafter the charge has been introduced, is inserted to reach the bottom of\r\nthe hole, which is now ready for tamping. For this purpose, any soft\r\nspecies of rock free from flinty particles, which might provoke a\r\npremature explosion, is introduced in small quantities at a time, and\r\nrammed very hard by the tamping bar, which is held steadily by one man\r\nand struck with a sledge by another. The hole being thus filled, the\r\nnail is withdrawn by putting a bar through its eye and striking it\r\nupwards. Thus a small perforation or vent is left for the safety fuse, a\r\nwoven cylinder containing gunpowder, and protected by a coating of tar.\r\nThe fire being applied, the men retire to a safe distance.\r\n\r\nOften, in order to lose as little time as possible, a number of shots\r\nare fired together, so that the explosions, pouring out their tongues of\r\nflame in rapid succession, and awakening the subterranean echoes far and\r\nwide, afford a highly interesting spectacle. But woe to the miner if he\r\nbe too hasty to return to his post, for it often happens that a\r\ntreacherous shot goes off several minutes after being lighted, and,\r\nexploding in the face of the imprudent workman, disfigures him for life,\r\nor kills him on the spot.\r\n\r\nAccidents in blasting arise also from other causes, such as a negligent\r\nhandling of the powder while preparing the charge, or some delay in\r\nretiring after the fuse has been kindled. It was an incident of the\r\nlatter kind which some years back called forth the following instance of\r\nheroism.\r\n\r\n‘In a certain Cornish mine,’ says Thomas Carlyle,[36] ‘two miners, deep\r\ndown in the shaft, were engaged in putting in a shot for blasting; they\r\nhad completed their affair, and were about to give the signal for being\r\nhoisted up. One at a time was all their coadjutor at the top could\r\nmanage, and the second was to kindle the match and then mount with all\r\nspeed. Now it chanced, while they were still below, one of them thought\r\nthe match too long, tried to break it shorter, took a couple of stones,\r\na flat and a sharp, to cut it shorter, did cut it off the due length,\r\nbut, horrible to relate, kindled it at the same time, and both were\r\nstill below. Both shouted vehemently to the coadjutor at the windlass,\r\nboth sprang at the basket; the windlass-man could not move it with them\r\nboth. Here was a moment for poor miner Jack and miner Will! Instant\r\nhorrible death hangs over both, when Will generously resigns himself.\r\n“Go aloft, Jack, and sit down. Away! In one minute I shall be in\r\nheaven!” Jack bounds aloft, the explosion instantly follows, bruises his\r\nface as he looks over; he is safe above ground; and poor Will?\r\nDescending eagerly, they find poor Will, too, as if by miracle, buried\r\nunder rocks which had arched themselves over him, and little injured; he\r\ntoo is brought up safe; and all ends joyfully, say the newspapers, which\r\nhave duly specified the event.\r\n\r\nFootnote 36:\r\n\r\n  ‘Life of Sterling,’ p. 278.\r\n\r\n‘Such a piece of manly promptitude and salutary human heroism was worth\r\ninvestigating. It was investigated and found to be accurate to the\r\nletter, with this addition and explanation, that Will Verran, an honest,\r\nignorant, good man, entirely given up to Methodism, had been perfect in\r\nthe “faith of assurance;” certain that _he_ should get to heaven if he\r\ndied, certain that Jack Roberts would not, which had been the ground of\r\nhis decision in that great moment; for the rest that he much wished to\r\nlearn reading and writing, and find some way of life above ground\r\ninstead of below. By aid of the Misses Fox and the rest of that family,\r\na subscription (modest _Anti_-Hudson Testimonial) was raised for this\r\nMethodist hero; he emerged into daylight with fifty pounds in his\r\npocket; did strenuously try, for certain months, to learn reading and\r\nwriting; found he could not learn those arts, or either of them; took\r\nhis money and bought cows with it, wedding at the same time some likely\r\nmilkmaid.’\r\n\r\nSeveral attempts have recently been made to diminish the dangers of\r\nblasting, by substituting gun-cotton or nitroglycerine for gunpowder; or\r\nby firing charges by means of the electric battery, but hitherto without\r\nmuch success.\r\n\r\nAn enormous quantity of gunpowder is consumed for blasting in many of\r\nthe larger mines. In 1836, 64,000 pounds were used in the Consolidated\r\nMines in Cornwall, and 90,100 pounds in the Fowey Consolidated Copper\r\nMines. The total amount of gunpowder consumed in the Cornish and\r\nDevonian Mines in the year 1837 reached 300 tons, which cost 13,200_l_.\r\nThis one item may serve to give some idea of the enormous working\r\nexpenses of a large mining concern.\r\n\r\nSometimes the rock is so tenacious as to render boring too tedious and\r\nexpensive an operation, and fire becomes necessary for subduing the\r\nsolidity of the stone. In this manner the ancient mine of Rammelsberg,\r\nnear Goslar, is forced to yield its treasures, and whole forests are\r\nannually consumed in order to loosen the hornstone and indestructible\r\nspar of its metalliferous veins. Every Saturday morning the fire is\r\napplied to the numerous piles of billets and faggots that have been\r\ndistributed throughout the course of the week. Those in the upper floors\r\nof exploitation are first burned, in order that the inferior piles may\r\nnot obstruct by their vitiated air the combustion of the former. Thus at\r\nfour o’clock in the morning the fires are kindled in the upper ranges,\r\nand then from pile to pile the firemen descend towards the lower floor,\r\nwhich occupies them till three o’clock in the afternoon. The vaults of\r\nRammelsberg now afford a truly magnificent spectacle. The rising flames,\r\nflickering against the walls of the vaults, and ascending in broad\r\nsheets towards their roof; the dense clouds of smoke rolling towards the\r\nair vents; the crackling of the wood; the loud detonations of the stones\r\nrent by the expansive force of heat from the primitive rock; the lurid\r\nglare of the conflagration; the naked workmen with their mighty\r\nstirring-poles, flitting like dark spirits before the blazing pile; the\r\nintense heat, and the air loaded to suffocation with sulphurous fumes,—\r\nall combine to produce a picture worthy of Dante’s ‘Inferno.’ During the\r\nSunday the noxious vapours engendered by the conflagration have time to\r\ndisperse; and on the Monday morning the workmen detach, with long forks\r\nof iron, the ores that have been loosened by the flames.\r\n\r\nThe ore being extracted from its bed, it becomes necessary to bring it\r\nto the light of day, an operation which is of course of the greatest\r\nimportance, and not seldom requires the aid of complicated machinery,\r\nparticularly in coal mines, where large masses have to be conveyed as\r\neconomically and speedily as possible to the upper world.\r\n\r\nA great improvement has been effected of late years in the facility of\r\ntransporting minerals underground, by the introduction of small\r\ntramroads, and the saving of expense thus effected sometimes amounts to\r\none-half the former cost. Many of our larger mines are provided with\r\nmiles of this subterranean railroad, and the advantage is greater,\r\nbecause for the most part there is a slight descent from the workings to\r\nthe bottom of the shaft, to allow of a more complete system of drainage\r\nthan could otherwise be attained. But frequently where the galleries are\r\nlow, narrow, and crooked, the carriage is still effected by means of\r\nsledges, barrows, or little waggons, which are with difficulty dragged\r\nor pushed along, over planks or uneven and muddy roads; and sometimes\r\neven the interior transport of the ore is executed on the backs of men—a\r\nmost disadvantageous practice, which is gradually wearing out.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CONVEYANCE OF MINERALS UNDERGROUND.]\r\n\r\nIn great mines, such as the coal and salt mines of Great Britain, the\r\nsalt mines of Wielitzka, the copper mines of Fahlun, the lead mines of\r\nAlston Moor, horses have long been introduced into the workings, to drag\r\nheavier waggons, or a train of waggons attached to one another. In some\r\ncases these animals are brought to the surface at stated intervals, but\r\ngenerally when once let down the pit they for ever bid adieu to the\r\nlight of day. Strange to say, this _unnatural_ mode of existence, which\r\nwould soon undermine the vigour and spirits of man, agrees admirably\r\nwell with their health, of which the greatest care is taken, as their\r\nuseful services are duly appreciated by their owners. They are\r\nabundantly fed with hay and oats of the best quality; their stalls are\r\nlarge and well ventilated; and as they labour in a mild and equable\r\ntemperature, they remain free from many complaints to which horses are\r\nliable. Their good condition and sleek, shining coats prove that they\r\nhave no sentimental longing for green fields or the bright sunshine. In\r\na few of the largest collieries it has been found advantageous to\r\nestablish underground stationary engines, which bring the trains of\r\nwaggons, by means of an endless rope, along the galleries to the bottom\r\nof the shaft. In other mines, such as those of Worsley in Lancashire,\r\nsubterranean canals are cut, upon which the mineral is transported in\r\nboats.\r\n\r\nIn the European mines, the ores are usually lifted from the bottom of\r\nthe shaft to the surface by steam-power, or horse-gins; but in Spanish\r\nAmerica, men, and even women, are employed for this purpose. The steep\r\nladders which they ascend with heavy weights upon their backs, consist\r\nmerely of the thick trunks of fir-trees, into which, at intervals of\r\nevery ten or eleven inches, deep notches have been cut; but these rude\r\nsteps are mounted with perfect security and ease by the sure-footed\r\nIndians.\r\n\r\nIn many European mines, where the workmen are let down or raised by\r\nmeans of ropes, wire cables, or chains, they sometimes sit on transverse\r\nround pieces of wood or in a kind of chair, consisting of two strong\r\nleather belts, one of which serves as a seat, and the other for\r\nsupporting the back. In Wielitzka ten of these chairs are attached to\r\nthe cable at distances of seven or eight feet one from another. The\r\npersons seated in the uppermost and lowest chairs direct the descent,\r\nand take great care to prevent the conveyance grazing against the sides\r\nof the shaft, for were it to be hooked fast by a nail or any other\r\nprojection, a fall into a deep precipice of several hundred feet would\r\nbe the almost inevitable and fatal consequence. The old method of\r\ndescending into a colliery was by a corf or strong basket, hooked on by\r\na chain to the rope that hung down the shaft. Stepping into this, the\r\nmen would swing down the dark hollow, gaily and readily, but not always\r\nsafely.\r\n\r\nThus, in the year 1835, in a colliery near Liège, seven workmen were\r\nalready seated in a corf that was about to descend into the shaft, when\r\none of their comrades, anxious to seize the opportunity, came hurrying\r\nalong, and, in spite of all remonstrances, jumped into it; but the rope,\r\nunable to bear the shock and the increased weight, suddenly snapped, and\r\nall eight were precipitated into the abyss, from which not one of them\r\ncame forth alive.\r\n\r\nIn the Swedish mines small barrels or tuns are generally used as\r\nvehicles of descent, and the workmen are uncommonly dexterous in\r\npreventing their little aërial skiff from striking against the rugged\r\nrock-walls, when it would run the danger of being wrecked. Women, and\r\neven children, who find occupation in the mines, are often seen standing\r\non the narrow edge of one of these swinging, turning, or oscillating\r\ntuns, with an arm slung round the rope; and such is the power of habit\r\nthat they will quietly knit where even a stout-nerved man would be\r\nappalled by the frowning cliffs above or the black abyss below.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1785 a girl, descending alone into the pit of Fahlun, and\r\nunable to direct the tun, could not prevent it from striking against a\r\nrock. Jerked out of her conveyance by the violence of the shock, she\r\nfell upon a narrow ledge, about one hundred feet from the bottom of the\r\npit, to which she clung with all the energy of despair. Her position was\r\nindeed terrific, for the least motion would have precipitated her into\r\nthe dark grave which seemed to yawn for her reception, and to have given\r\nher but a momentary respite in order to make her feel more bitterly the\r\npangs of approaching death. Already her strength was giving way, already\r\na cloud swam before her eyes, when some bold miners, venturing their own\r\nlives in the hazardous undertaking, succeeded in rescuing her from her\r\nawful position, and snatching her as it were from the very jaws of\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nAnother method much adopted, and preferred by the pitmen in our\r\ncollieries, was passing down and up in the loop. The pitman inserted one\r\nleg into a loop formed by curving the terminal chain and hooking it back\r\nupon an upper link, and then twined his arm tightly round the rope\r\nabove. In this way he descended through any depth, and, as he alleged,\r\nwith greater safety than in a bucket, out of which he might be ejected,\r\nwhile nothing except the breaking of the rope could harm him in loop.\r\n\r\nAt present the safety-cage is generally used. This is simply a vertical\r\nrailway carriage running down and up upon guides, and thereby\r\nintroducing into the shaft the improvements of the iron road. Into one\r\nof its square narrow compartments two or three men crouch together,\r\nothers get into an upper compartment, and down the cage moves easily and\r\nsafely, the men needing only to take care that hands or fingers do not\r\nhang beyond the edge, while four or five minutes of easy motion carry\r\nthem down a thousand or fifteen hundred feet below the surface of the\r\nearth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MINERS DESCENDING SHAFT IN OWEN’S SAFETY CAGE.]\r\n\r\nIn many mines the workmen climb up and down the shafts on fixed ladders,\r\nwith landing-stages for resting; and it may easily be imagined how\r\nseverely their strength must be taxed when, after their hard day’s\r\nlabour, they have still to ascend step by step a thousand or even two\r\nthousand feet, before they can return to their families. Some of the\r\nCornish mines require a full hour to rise from the lowest depths to\r\n‘grass,’ and besides this considerable loss of time, diseases of the\r\nlungs and heart, which often terminate fatally, or prematurely make the\r\nminer an invalid, are the consequence of these fatiguing journeys.\r\n\r\n‘O thou grumbling clerk in London city,’ exclaims the author of\r\n‘Cornwall and its Mines,’[37] ‘whose daily fatigues only extend to the\r\nascent into and descent from the trim omnibus that takes you to or from\r\nPeckham or Kennington! Only think for a moment of travelling some four\r\nor five times the height of St. Paul’s daily—before and after work! O\r\nthou querulous socialist, demagogue, or artisan, who canst sit in a\r\ncomfortable coffee-house, under a flaming gas-light, immediately before\r\nand after work—or in your own snug parlour, by your own fireside or\r\nmurmuring kettle—do but think for a moment of the Cornish miner, and\r\nwhat he must do before he can reach home or house! I fully believe that\r\nthe best cure for discontent and gloom in fortunate workmen would be to\r\nput them upon the treadmill of a deep Cornish mine—for a temporary\r\ntreadmill it is.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 37:\r\n\r\n  London: Longmans, 1857.\r\n\r\nIt had long been deemed of the utmost importance to devise some easier\r\nmode of locomotion; but it was not till 1833 that the circumstance of\r\ntwo water-wheels having been thrown out of work by the opening of the\r\ndeep Georg Adit in the Hartz mines suggested the idea of employing the\r\npump-rods for aiding the ascent of the miners. The trial was first made\r\nwith a portion of one hundred fathoms. This was divided into twenty-two\r\nportions; and on each portion iron steps were fixed, at intervals of\r\nfour feet, while hand-holds were fixed at convenient distances. A\r\nreciprocating motion of four feet was given to each rod, and the miners\r\nstepped to and fro from a bracket or ledge on one rod to the parallel\r\none on the other. As one rod is always descending while the other is\r\nascending, and _vice versâ_, it is easy to understand how this alternate\r\nstepping on to the little platforms must lead to the ascent or descent\r\nof the miner. At the division between each two of the twenty-two\r\nportions, there is a larger platform on which he may rest awhile; and\r\nnothing is lost by his rest, for the reciprocal motion goes on, and is\r\nready again for his use when he is ready for it. This first machine\r\nsurpassed expectation. Short as the length of ascent was, many invalids\r\nof the district were now able to resume their underground labours, as\r\nthe fatigue of mounting or descending was reduced, by the alternate\r\naction of the machinery, to a mere easy lateral motion.\r\n\r\nThe advantages of this new method in saving both time and power were so\r\nobvious that it was soon imitated in the other deep metalliferous veins\r\nof the Hartz; and at present power-ladders or _man-engines_ of an\r\nimproved construction, such as the substitution of a single rod for the\r\ndouble apparatus above described, are in very general use over the\r\nContinent, whence they have passed in a modified form into Cornwall,\r\nwhere they are worked by steam. In Fowey Consols Mine the machine\r\nextends to a depth of 1,680 feet. The rod is eight inches square, with\r\ntwelve-inch platforms at intervals of twelve feet; and there are\r\nstationary platforms equidistant at the side of the shaft. When a miner\r\nis about to descend the steps on a movable platform, the rod descends\r\nand carries him down twelve feet; he steps upon a fixed platform while\r\nthe rod rises again; he then steps upon another movable platform, and\r\ndescends another twelve feet, and so on to the bottom. In ascending,\r\nthere is simply a reversed process. It is a very interesting sight to\r\nwitness the ascent or descent of bodies of miners at certain hours of\r\nthe day and night. You see them passing each other in the shafts, in a\r\nkind of zig-zag course, of as great regularity as any zig-zag will\r\npermit. As one miner steps off the rod platform to one fixed platform,\r\nanother steps on to it from another fixed platform on the other side.\r\nThus there are two streams of miners moving in opposite directions along\r\nthe same rod at the same time, and this curious spectacle is rendered\r\ndoubly pleasing when we consider how much distressing toil has been\r\nalleviated by the employment of the man-engine. Machinery constructed on\r\nthe same principle has been latterly adopted in the mines of Anzin, for\r\ntransporting the coal step by step to the surface; and it is evident\r\nthat when coal mines are worked at greater depths than at present,\r\nropes, however strong, will no longer be able to sustain even their own\r\nweight, and the whole transport up and down a shaft of perhaps 3,000 or\r\n3,500 feet must be performed by means of similar machines.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TIMBERING OF A MINE.]\r\n\r\nWherever the excavated rock is not hard or solid enough to bear the\r\nsuperincumbent weight, the galleries of a mine must necessarily be\r\nsupported by timbering or walling. Timbering is most used, frequently in\r\nthe form represented in the annexed woodcut; and when we consider how\r\nmiles upon miles of galleries are thus supported, we can easily imagine\r\nthat whole forests must be engulfed in our mines. It has been calculated\r\nthat for the total quantity of timber in use for mining purposes in\r\nCornwall, it would require no less than 140 square miles of forest of\r\nNorwegian pine, averaging a growth of 120 years. The expense thus\r\nincurred is enormous; the cost for timber, duty free, in Cornish and\r\nDevon mines, amounted in 1836 to 94,138_l._ and is probably still larger\r\nat the present time. For timbering, no tree is more esteemed than the\r\nlarch or the Norwegian pine, on account of its great durability in the\r\nwet; but whatever wood may be employed, it is necessary to peel off the\r\nbark, experience having shown that unless this is done the wood rots\r\nmuch more easily, as the fibres of the rind attract a far greater\r\nquantity of moisture than the smooth surface of the splint. Like the\r\npotato and the grape, subterranean timbering is exposed to the attacks\r\nof a fungus, producing what is called dry-rot. The parasite germinates\r\nin the sap which remains in the wood, or at least derives its\r\nnourishment from it. Its vegetation is at first scarcely perceptible;\r\nbut soon its white fibres multiply, and form at length small sponges on\r\nthe surface. The decomposition of the wood now advances with rapid\r\nstrides, and terminates at last in the total destruction of the ligneous\r\nfibres. Not satisfied with depriving the roof of its support, the dry-\r\nrot likewise produces a vitiation of the air, so that wherever timbering\r\nis employed, it is reckoned among the great enemies of the mine and of\r\nthe miner. Many remedies have been recommended, among which _kyanizing_,\r\nor saturating the wood with a solution of corrosive sublimate, is one of\r\nthe most efficacious, though unfortunately too expensive to be of\r\nuniversal use. Mushrooms of various kinds likewise flourish upon the\r\nmoist surface of the spars, and various insects collect near this\r\nparasitic vegetation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TRANSVERSE SECTIONS OF WALLED DRAIN GALLERIES.]\r\n\r\nThe timbering of a mine also affords very convenient lurking-places to\r\nthe numerous rats which are met with underground, where they contrive to\r\nlive upon the crumbs or offal of the miners’ meals, or upon candle-ends\r\nand remains of wicks. Not seldom the timbering of a gallery, weakened by\r\nrot, gives way under the pressure of the roof, which falls in with a\r\ntremendous crash, and sometimes buries the unfortunate miner under its\r\nruins. Another disadvantage attending timbering is its liability to\r\ncatch fire, and thus, wherever the cost is not found too great, the\r\nchief galleries of a mine are now usually constructed of stone.\r\nSometimes the two sides of a gallery are lined with vertical walls, and\r\nits roof is supported by an ogival vault or an arch. If the sides of the\r\nmine are solid, a simple arch is sufficient to sustain the roof; and at\r\nother times the whole surface of a gallery is formed of a single\r\nelliptic vault, the great axis of which is vertical, and the bottom is\r\nsurmounted by a wooden plank, under which the waters run off.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  DRAINAGE OF A MINE BY ADIT LEVELS.\r\n  _a._ Shaft. _b._ Shallow adit. _c._ Deep adit. _d._ Mineral lode.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe miner is generally in a state of perpetual warfare with the water,\r\nwhich threatens to inundate the scene of his labours; and as in a leaky\r\nship the pumps must be kept continually working to prevent the vessel\r\nfrom sinking, so here also perpetual efforts are necessary to keep off\r\nthe encroachments of this never-tiring foe. When a mine is situated\r\nabove the level of a valley or of the neighbouring sea, its drainage may\r\nbe effected in a comparatively easy manner by means of sloping\r\ngalleries, dry-levels or adits, which in many cases serve also for the\r\ntransport of the ore or coal. In some mines these drainage levels are\r\nexecuted on a truly gigantic scale. Thus the Great Cornish Adit, which\r\nextends through the large mining district of Gwennap, begins in the\r\nvalley above Carnon, and receives the branch adits of fifty mines in the\r\nparish of Gwennap, forming excavations and ramifications which have an\r\naggregate extent of between thirty and forty miles, and which are in\r\nsome places 400 feet below the surface of the ground. The longest branch\r\nis from Cardrew mine, and is five and a half miles in length. This great\r\nadit opens into the sea at Restronget Creek, and empties its waters into\r\nFalmouth Harbour.\r\n\r\nA similar great drain is Nent Force Level, in the north of England,\r\nwhich drains the numerous mines in Alston Moor. It consists of a\r\nstupendous aqueduct nine feet broad, and in some places from sixteen to\r\ntwenty feet high. For more than three miles it passes under the course\r\nof the river Nent, to Nentsbury engine-shaft, and is navigated\r\nunderground by long narrow boats. At the distance of a mile in the\r\ninterior, daylight is seen at its mouth like a star, and this star is\r\ncontinually enlarging upon you until you find yourself in open daylight.\r\nThe ramifications of the Great Adit Levels of the mines of Freiberg in\r\nSaxony have a total length of seventy-two miles; but the most stupendous\r\nworks of this description are those in the district of Clausthal and\r\nZellerfeld, in the Hartz, where, as the mining operations have been\r\ncarried on deeper and deeper, adits have been successively driven below\r\nadits. Four of these levels date from times previous to the seventeenth\r\ncentury; but, as they were found insufficient, the famous Georg Stollen\r\nwas added to their number in 1777. This gigantic tunnel, which, piercing\r\nthe hard rock, required twenty-three years for its completion, is above\r\nfive miles long, and passes 900 feet below the church of Clausthal. It\r\nserves the double purpose of a draining gallery and of a navigable\r\ncanal. The water is always kept at a height of from fifty to sixty\r\ninches; and the boats, which carry about five tons, are propelled by\r\nmeans of a chain attached to the vault, along which the boatmen drag or\r\npush them forward. In this economical manner about 20,000 tons of ore\r\nare annually brought to daylight. The boats are made and repaired in a\r\nsubterranean wharf, which, though far from being one of the largest, may\r\nprobably boast of being the deepest.\r\n\r\nUntil 1851 the Georg Stollen answered all the purposes for which it was\r\nconstructed, but at the end of that period the increased depth and\r\nextension of the mines rendered necessary the addition of a new great\r\nadit level, which has been named the ‘Ernst August Stollen,’ in honour\r\nof the late king of Hanover. In spite of its vast dimensions, this\r\nmagnificent work, which is six and three-quarter miles long, about ten\r\nfeet high, and six and a half broad, required only thirteen years for\r\nits completion, and may justly be considered as one of the triumphs of\r\nmodern engineering. The excavation was begun simultaneously at ten\r\ndifferent points, and such was the admirable precision of the plans that\r\nall the junctions of the different sections of the gallery fitted\r\naccurately into each other.\r\n\r\nBelow the Ernst August Gallery (437 yards), the form of the country\r\nallows no deeper adit level to be driven; but to provide for the\r\nincreasing vertical extension of the workings, a new underground\r\ngallery, without any opening to the surface, and at a depth of 262 yards\r\nbelow the former, is already in contemplation. The water is to be raised\r\nto the Ernst August Level by a special hydraulic machine placed in a\r\nvertical shaft, which will serve at the same time for raising the ore\r\nand for the passage of the miners. The expense is calculated at about\r\n60,000_l._ but will be amply repaid by the new field of mineral wealth\r\nwhich it will open. Thus in the Hartz one magnificent work is but the\r\nprecursor of another.\r\n\r\nWhen a mine is so situated that drainage galleries cannot be\r\nestablished, engines must be employed for pumping up the waters. Thus,\r\nin Cornwall, where most of the copper mines open almost at the sea\r\nlevel, an enormous influx of water can be kept in check only by an\r\nequally enormous steam-power. In the United and Consolidated Mines\r\nbetween Truro and Redruth, seven steam-pumps, working with the united\r\nstrength of 2,000 horses, are kept constantly in motion, and raise above\r\n2,500,000 gallons of water in twenty-four hours.\r\n\r\nIn 1837 the whole quantity of water pumped out of the earth by sixty\r\nCornish engines attained the amazing aggregate of close upon thirty-\r\nseven millions of tons; but since then mining has been carried on more\r\nextensively and deeper, and consequently additional steam-power has\r\nbecome necessary to keep pace with the increasing waters.\r\n\r\n‘Even to the eye of an observer who is practised in machinery[38] of\r\ngreat magnitude, the first sight and the subsequent examination of such\r\nengines is very gratifying. To watch the labour of a giant would be\r\ninteresting; but to see the giant not only labouring at ease amidst his\r\nenormous work but at the same time at the command of a child, who should\r\nbe able to stop him at any moment—this would be doubly interesting. Such\r\nis the case with the great Cornish engines, for even the largest of them\r\nmay be stopped by a child of ten or twelve years of age. Another\r\npeculiar feature, too, of these engines is this, that they work with a\r\nquietness—or absence of clash and clatter—which is in the inverse ratio\r\nof their magnitude. The water makes a great rush in the pumps, but the\r\nengine itself is calm and comparatively noiseless—like a great mountain\r\nreposing in calm greatness while a perpetual spring brawls at its feet.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 38:\r\n\r\n  ‘Cornwall, its Mines and Miners.’\r\n\r\nIn the coal-fields of the North equally gigantic efforts must be made to\r\nkeep down the water.\r\n\r\nIn sinking to the coal at Dalton-le-Dale, eight or nine miles from\r\nDurham, the borers penetrated the vast bed of sand beneath the magnesian\r\nlimestone, which appears to contain the chief subterranean water-stores\r\nof the district. In this case their outburst was truly terrific,\r\namounting, on June 1, 1840, to the enormous quantity of 3,285 gallons\r\nevery minute. To oppose this formidable enemy the spirited proprietors\r\nof the mine at once proceeded to erect the necessary steam-power for\r\npumping off 3,000 or 4,000 gallons a minute; but, the waters still\r\nincreasing, it became necessary to meet them with a double and treble\r\nforce, so that finally the floods had to be kept down by steam engines\r\nof an aggregate power equivalent to 1,584 horses and setting twenty-\r\nseven sets of pumps in motion.\r\n\r\nSometimes the influx of water into a coal mine is so enormous that no\r\nhuman contrivance can oppose it, and man is obliged to give up the\r\nconflict in despair. During the progress of the attempted winning of a\r\npit at Haswell in the county of Durham, the engine power erected pumped\r\nout the water to the amount of 26,700 tons per day; but still the floods\r\ncame in, and at last won the victory.\r\n\r\nFrom the same cause many collieries have been closed, of late years, on\r\nthe banks of the Tyne, and among these the famous Wallsend Colliery,\r\nwhich has given its name to the best kinds of coal.\r\n\r\nThe drowning of a coal mine not seldom occurs from the irruption of\r\nwater accumulated in old wastes or ancient workings occupying a higher\r\nlevel in the vicinity. The growing pressure of such a body of water upon\r\nthe beds or barriers below becomes enormous; and then the water, testing\r\nevery weak point of the body opposed to its escape, at length\r\nunexpectedly rushes into the space which it finds open before it. All\r\nthe works below are completely filled, and the mines are for a time\r\nrendered useless, or, it may be, for ever abandoned. This was the cause,\r\nin 1815, of the celebrated accident at Heaton, near Newcastle-on-Tyne,\r\nin which ninety lives were lost. The water flowed from two adjoining old\r\ncollieries which had been abandoned seventy years before. A barrier of\r\nsix feet withstood a pressure of thirty fathoms of water. But an\r\nirruption was aided at last by a natural fissure of the rock, and the\r\ncatastrophe followed before any adequate protection could be interposed.\r\n\r\nAbout thirty years later a tremendous calamity of the like kind, after\r\nan outlay of 100,000_l._, totally ruined the Baghilt coal mines, in\r\nWales. The water came from adjoining mines, which had been long\r\nabandoned.\r\n\r\nIf correct plans and descriptions of all the ancient workings had been\r\npreserved, these accidents, which happen frequently, might easily be\r\nprevented, as an exact knowledge of the localities would enable the\r\nowners to leave sufficiently strong barriers in parts where they are now\r\noften most inadequate. Such is the importance of accurate mining records\r\nthat thousands of pounds would be freely given at this moment by many\r\nowners for a knowledge of old works of which no plan exists and which no\r\nmemory can now recall. Fortunately, the legislature has now taken steps\r\nto introduce a system of registration such as has already existed long\r\nago in Prussia, Austria, and Belgium, and which, at least, will answer\r\nthe purpose of obtaining greater security for the future.\r\n\r\nSometimes an enormous fall of rain, descending on the neighbouring\r\ncountry, finds its way into the mines through fissures in the ground or\r\nby breaking through galleries, and causes irreparable mischief;\r\nsometimes even a whole river bursts into the works and ruins them for\r\never. Thus, in 1856, the South Tamar Consols, in Devonshire, was flooded\r\nby the giving way of the bed of the Tamar, under which the workings were\r\ncarried.\r\n\r\nEven the Sea has been known to take fatal vengeance for the undermining\r\nof her domain.\r\n\r\nWorkington Colliery extended to the distance of 1,500 yards under the\r\nIrish Channel, and the workings, being driven considerably to the rise,\r\nwere brought at length within fifteen fathoms of the bottom of the sea.\r\nThe pillars of coal which supported the overlying strata were hardly\r\nstrong enough to support the roof, but the imprudence of a manager eager\r\nto produce a larger quantity of coal weakened even this insufficient\r\nsupport by working it partly away. Heavy falls of the roof, accompanied\r\nby discharges of salt water, gave repeated warnings of the impending\r\ncatastrophe, which took place on July 30, 1837. So violent was the\r\nirruption that many persons at a distance of hundreds of yards observed\r\nthe whirlpool commotion of the sea as it rushed into the gulf beneath.\r\nSome few workmen near the shaft had time to escape, but thirty-six men\r\nand boys and as many horses were destroyed by the waters, which in a few\r\nhours entirely filled the excavations, the extension of which had tasked\r\nthe labour of years.\r\n\r\nThe heroic devotion of a miner has invested with a more than ordinary\r\ninterest the inundation of the mine of Beaujonc, near Liège, which took\r\nplace on February 28, 1812. One hundred and twenty-seven persons were in\r\nthe pit when the waters burst in from some old workings. Thirty-five had\r\ntime to make their escape through the shaft; twenty-two were drowned in\r\ntheir eagerness to reach it; the majority, severed from the upper world\r\nby an impassable gulf, remained behind. Hubert Goffin, the overman,\r\ncould have ascended in the tub; but, though the father of six children,\r\nhis sense of duty would not allow him to desert his post, and he\r\nresolved to save all his men or to perish with them. As the rising\r\nwaters forced the prisoners to seek a higher level, the boys burst out\r\nweeping and the boldest began to despair; but Goffin revived their\r\ncourage by reminding them that their friends without would make every\r\neffort to save them. As one day after another passed, the prisoners\r\nsuffered all the horrors of hunger, which some of them endeavoured to\r\nappease by devouring the candles they had brought with them. Others went\r\nto the water in the hopes of finding the body of some drowned comrade.\r\nTwo of the pitmen quarrelled, and were on the point of coming to blows.\r\n‘Let them fight,’ said the others; ‘if one of them is killed we will eat\r\nhim’—a declaration which at once put an end to the dispute. To satisfy\r\ntheir thirst they had nothing but the foul water of the pit. Some made\r\nvows to all the saints, others complained in their delirium that they\r\nhad to wait for their meals. In the midst of these scenes of horror,\r\nGoffin alone retained his courage, and, exhorting, consoling,\r\nencouraging, and reproving on all sides, appeared as the guardian angel\r\nof his despairing comrades.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile every effort was being made from without to bring them\r\nsuccour. Although as soon as the accident took place the pumps were\r\nincessantly at work, the water had risen to a height of 14 metres in the\r\nshaft on the following morning, and as it was still rising there was\r\nreason to fear that the captives, blocked up in a constantly narrowing\r\nspace, would soon be suffocated. It was resolved to strike a gallery\r\nfrom the neighbouring pit of Mamouster to Beaujonc, a distance of 175\r\nmetres. Unfortunately, only two men could hew at a time, but such was\r\nthe ardour with which the work was prosecuted that on the morning of\r\nMarch 4 a shout of triumph announced that the longed-for communication\r\nwas effected, and that the prisoners were alive. Crawling through the\r\nnarrow passage, they were wrapped up in woollen blankets and\r\nstrengthened with soup and wine before being hoisted to the surface.\r\nGoffin and his son, a lad of twelve, were the last to leave the pit; as\r\na brave sea captain, after some great catastrophe, never thinks of his\r\nown safety till he has satisfied himself of that of his men. With the\r\nexception of those who were drowned immediately after the accident took\r\nplace, all were saved. The joy of some families, the despair of others,\r\nmay be imagined when the final count was made. As a reward for Goffin’s\r\nadmirable conduct, he was decorated with the cross of the Legion of\r\nHonour and received a pension of 600 francs. Nine years later he was\r\nkilled by an explosion of fire-damp, and thus the hostile elements with\r\nwhich he had so long waged a successful war triumphed over him at last.\r\n\r\nThe sudden irruption of an immense body of water into a mine naturally\r\ncauses a compression of the air in those galleries which are cut off\r\nfrom all communication with the shaft. This pressure, which may rise to\r\nthree or four atmospheres—or, in other words, may be three or four times\r\ngreater than that of the external air—not only produces symptoms of\r\nsuffocation and cerebral congestion in the unfortunate miners who are\r\nexposed to it, but, forcing its way through fissures in the roof or\r\nviolently rupturing it, sometimes produces the effect of an explosion of\r\ngunpowder, throwing the earth to a distance, and even overturning\r\nhouses. One of the most interesting of the accidents of this kind on\r\nrecord occurred in 1833, in an extensive Scotch colliery, into which the\r\nwaters of the river Garnock had broken through a cavity in its bed. As\r\nthe stream poured into the mine the opening gradually enlarged, until at\r\nlength the whole body of the river plunged into the excavations beneath.\r\nThe river was affected by the tides, and this engulfment took place at\r\nlow water; but as the tide rose the sea entered with prodigious force,\r\nuntil the whole workings, extending for many miles, were completely\r\nfilled. No sooner, however, had this taken place, than the pressure of\r\nthe water in the pits became so great that the confined air, which had\r\nbeen forced back into the high workings, burst through the surface of\r\nthe earth in a thousand places, and many acres of ground were seen to\r\nbubble up like the boiling of a cauldron. Great quantities of sand and\r\nwater were also thrown up, like showers of rain, during a period of five\r\nhours, and an extensive tract of land was laid waste.\r\n\r\nBesides the danger of being crushed to death by a fall of rock, or\r\nimmured in a living tomb by an obstruction of the shaft or an irruption\r\nof water, the miner has another, and often still more formidable, enemy\r\nto encounter in the noxious gases frequently evolved in coal-pits. Thus\r\nin all well-regulated mines the greatest attention is paid to\r\nventilation, so that no part of the workings may be left without a\r\nproper supply of air. In ordinary cases the natural currents, which set\r\nin different directions through the shafts and galleries, may\r\nsufficiently purify the atmosphere; but in the coal mines which are\r\npeculiarly subject to the evolution of foul gases, artificial or\r\nmechanical means must be resorted to for driving away the hurtful\r\nvapours as quickly as they form. To establish a proper air current, the\r\nusual method is to keep a large fire continually burning at the bottom\r\nof one of the two shafts of the pit, or of one of the two compartments\r\nof the single shaft, and the difference of temperature thus caused\r\nbetween the column of air of the _upcast_ shaft and the _downcast_\r\nbecomes the motive power which impels or drags the air current in\r\nobedience to it.[39] Yet this meets but half the difficulty; for the air\r\ncurrent, which naturally tends to the shortest passage, must be forced\r\nto do its duty in every corner of the pit, and not suffered to escape\r\nthrough the upcast shaft before it has performed the longest circuit.\r\nFor this purpose a great number of mechanical contrivances are adopted,\r\nin the shape of ‘stoppings,’ of brick, or wood, or stone, all so placed\r\nas to divert\r\n\r\nFootnote 39:\r\n\r\n  Mr. Samuel Plimsoll (‘Letters on the Iron Trade,’ _Times_, February\r\n  10, 1868) informs us that in the Belgian coal mines the ventilation is\r\n  carried on in a more economical and effective manner. Here no furnaces\r\n  are lighted at the bottom of the _upcast_, because one-twentieth of\r\n  the coal required for a furnace will make steam for an engine to work\r\n  fans which act somewhat in the manner of huge paddle-wheels in steam-\r\n  ships, and by rapid rotation over the shaft produce a draught which\r\n  the incoming air rushes to meet, and thus powerfully promote\r\n  ventilation. These fans they can work and control, and are therefore\r\n  independent of those atmospheric influences to which some of our\r\n  greatest calamities have been ascribed—the damp, heavy atmosphere of\r\n  early winter. In the great colliery of Sacrée Madame, near Charleroi,\r\n  one of these fans will draw 34,000 cubic metres (about 918,000 cubic\r\n  feet) per minute.\r\n\r\nand drive the air current into the several galleries of the pit, and to\r\nmake it perform every kind of complex movement, from turning back upon\r\nits own right or left to turning over in a somersault upon itself. The\r\nmost curious and admirably simple contrivance is that of splitting the\r\nair by means of a wooden erection, which meets and cuts the current in\r\ntwo, and sends one part on the one hand and another on the other hand.\r\nIn fact, what is commonly practised in minutely irrigating a meadow is\r\nalso effected in thoroughly airing a mine. We may form some idea of the\r\nunderground travels which the air is thus obliged to perform, by being\r\nforced along from split to split, when we hear that at Hetton Colliery\r\nthe ventilating current in the total equals no less than 196,000 cubic\r\nfeet of air per minute circulating through the mine at a velocity of 18\r\nfeet 3 inches per second.\r\n\r\nThe foul gases or damps evolved in mines are either heavy or light. The\r\nmost remarkable of the former is the _choke-damp_, or _black-damp_, the\r\nname given by the miners to carbonic acid gas. From its great specific\r\ngravity (1·527), this gas rests on the floor of the mine and gradually\r\naccumulates, having no tendency to escape beyond a slow mixture which\r\ntakes place with atmospheric air; while the light _fire-damp_, or\r\ncarburetted hydrogen, which, though not immediately fatal when breathed,\r\nexplodes on the slightest contact with flame, tends to rise to the\r\nsurface. The quantity of fire-damp which is poured out into the workings\r\nof some mines is very considerable, and constantly varying. Some seams\r\nof coal are much more full of it than others, and in working these,\r\nwhich are technically called _fiery seams_, it is not uncommon for a jet\r\nof inflammable air to issue out at every hole made for the reception of\r\nthe gunpowder before blasting.\r\n\r\nIn the celebrated Wallsend Colliery, in an attempt made to work the\r\nBensham Seam (an attempt which ended in a fearful accident), Mr. Buddle\r\nsaid, in evidence before a committee of the House of Commons:—‘I simply\r\ndrilled a hole into the solid coal, stuck a tin pipe into the aperture,\r\nsurrounded it with clay, and lighted it. I had immediately a gas light.\r\nThe quantity evolved from the coal was such that in every one of those\r\nplaces I had nothing to do but to apply a candle, and then could set a\r\nthousand pipes on fire. The whole face of the working was a gas-pipe\r\nfrom every pore of coal.’\r\n\r\nThe force with which the gas escapes on some occasions from clefts or\r\njoints is so great as to prove much previous compression. These sudden\r\noutbursts are locally termed _blowers_. Their issues and effects are\r\nsurprising. In one minute they have been known to foul the air to a\r\ndistance of 300 yards, and their noise is described as like that of\r\nrushing waters, or the roar of a blast furnace. They are not merely\r\ndangerous from their inflammable vapours, but also from the pieces of\r\ncoal which their tension not seldom forces from the roof, and whose fall\r\nmaims or kills the unfortunate workmen beneath.\r\n\r\nThe fire-damp is very liable to accumulate in old workings, or _goaves_,\r\nwhich thus, unless completely isolated by stone and mortar, become a\r\nhighly dangerous neighbourhood to the other parts of the mine. The\r\nimmense quantity of gas evolved from a goaf of about five acres in\r\nWallsend old pit affords a striking example of the danger of all such\r\naccumulations. A four-inch metallic pipe was conducted from the bottom\r\nof the pit to the surface of the ground and a few feet above it, when, a\r\nlight being applied, a hissing streamer of flame flashed forth and\r\nburned night and day. The amount of gas thus drawn off from the mine was\r\nat first computed at about 15,000 hogsheads in twenty-four hours. Long\r\ndid the little pipe continue to pour out in streaming flame thousands\r\nupon thousands of hogsheads of escaping fire-damp. The total issue might\r\nhave illuminated a little town.\r\n\r\nThe explosion of inflammable gas is the most fearful enemy the collier\r\nhas to encounter. Three or four cubic inches of carburetted hydrogen,\r\nwhen ignited, produce a detonation like that of a pistol-shot; half a\r\ncubic foot, enclosed in a bottle and set fire to, shivers the bottle\r\ninto fragments; hence we may judge how terrific the effects must be when\r\na blower pours forth its thousands of cubic feet into the galleries of a\r\nmine, and the careless approach of a light lets loose the demons of\r\ndestruction. The explosion of a large subterranean powder magazine would\r\nnot be more terrific. Often without a moment’s warning the unfortunate\r\npitman is scorched and shrivelled to a blackened mass, or is literally\r\nshattered to pieces against the rugged sides of the mine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SAFETY LAMP.]\r\n\r\nIt may easily be imagined that many efforts have been made, and many\r\ncontrivances suggested, to disarm the fire-damp of its terrors; but Sir\r\nHumphry Davy’s safety-lamp was the first invention which successfully\r\ncoped with it. The power of the safety-lamp lies in the _non-\r\ncommunication of explosions through small apertures_, and the discovery\r\nof this natural law, as well as its practical application, is one of the\r\ngreatest exploits of Sir Humphry Davy. A cylinder an inch and a half in\r\ndiameter and seven inches long, formed of wire gauze, with 784 apertures\r\nto the square inch, surrounds the light of the lamp. When the miner,\r\narmed with this apparatus, enters an atmosphere tainted with fire-damp,\r\na light blue flame fills the cylinder; but, as if chained by some magic\r\npower, it is unable to transgress its bounds; and as in our Zoological\r\nGardens we quietly view the beasts of the forest behind their iron\r\ngrating, so the miner looks calmly upon his powerless foe.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the negligence or the obstinate and blind perversity of\r\nthe miner too often renders even this splendid invention ineffectual.\r\n\r\nThe safety-lamp requires to be kept in perfect order, and unless certain\r\nprecautions are taken while using it, it loses its protecting power.\r\nThus, although perfectly secure when at rest, it seems certain that the\r\nrapid motion communicated by the swing of the arm during a hurried\r\ntransit through the mine has in many cases produced an explosion.\r\nBlowing out the lamp is likewise attended with danger, as the flame is\r\nthen easily driven through the gauze, and, like a tiger escaping from\r\nhis den, may spread terror and havoc around; but the chief cause of\r\naccidents consists in the small quantity of light diffused by the\r\nsafety-lamp, and the consequent dislike acquired by the miners to its\r\nuse.\r\n\r\nThough in all well-regulated coal-pits one or several workmen are\r\nexclusively employed in keeping the lamps in the most perfect order,\r\nthough they are handed to the miners burning and well closed, and fines\r\nare imposed upon any attempt to remove the gauze, yet the best\r\nregulations cannot possibly exclude the chance of accident resulting\r\nfrom the almost inconceivable carelessness of men whose daily tasks lead\r\nthem into imminent danger. Thus it is a melancholy but unquestionable\r\nfact that the number of accidents from fire-damp since the introduction\r\nof the Davy lamp has been many more in a given number of years than\r\nbefore that invention. This has, no doubt, partly arisen from the larger\r\nnumber of persons employed on the whole; but it is to be feared that it\r\nhas chiefly happened from dangerous portions of a mine being taken into\r\nwork which without the _Davy_ could not have been attempted, and partly\r\nalso from the extreme carelessness of the workmen in removing the wire\r\ngauze.[40]\r\n\r\nFootnote 40:\r\n\r\n  Recent improvements have done much to render the Davy lamp a more\r\n  perfect instrument of safety. These more or less insure increased\r\n  illumination, prevention of bad usage by locking, and more perfect\r\n  combustion. By an ingenious contrivance, one of these improved lamps\r\n  cannot be opened without previous extinguishment.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the fatal effects of this rashness are not confined to\r\nthe foolhardy miner who thus casts away the shield that preserves him\r\nfrom danger, but generally extend to many of his innocent comrades. In\r\nthe year 1856 an explosion which took place in the Cymmer coal-pit\r\nkilled 110 persons, and in the year 1857 170 workmen in the Lundshill\r\ncolliery were swept from life to death with the rapidity of lightning.\r\nIn the year 1858 the fire-damp levied a contribution of 215 victims in\r\nthe coal-pits of England, while in 1859 it was satisfied with 95. But in\r\n1860, as if to make up for this deficiency, it raged with double\r\nviolence; for, after having already claimed a tribute of 80 lives, the\r\ndreadful explosion which took place in the Risca Colliery on December 1\r\ndestroyed no less than 142 men and boys. The fire-damp explosion which\r\noccurred at the Oaks Colliery in 1866 swept away the unprecedented\r\nnumber of 361 victims, and in the same year 91 workmen perished from the\r\nsame cause at Talk-o’-th’-Hill Colliery.\r\n\r\nIn these dreadful catastrophes the most terrible agent of destruction is\r\nnot always the burning and concussion of the actual blast of fire-damp,\r\nbut the choke-damp which succeeds the explosion. For the carbon of the\r\ninflammable gas, uniting with the oxygen of the air, produces that\r\ndeadly poison, carbonic acid gas, which, from the disturbed ventilation\r\nof the pit, soon spreads far and wide through the galleries; so that the\r\npoor colliers who are caught in an exploded pit have two chances of\r\ndeath against them—one from burning, and the other from suffocation. The\r\neffect of death by the one gas or the other is very distinctly seen in\r\nthe countenances of the dead. The men killed by the fire-damp are marked\r\nwith burns and scorching, and their features are more or less distorted\r\nor disfigured. On the other hand, where men have been suffocated by\r\nchoke-damp, their features are placid and simply inanimate. The fragile\r\nand faulty separations (whether doors or stoppings of any kind) having\r\nbeen broken down, there is an end to a hope of safe retreat even for men\r\ntotally unharmed by the flames, for at once the air takes the shortest\r\ncourse between the entrance and exit, and leaves the shattered parts\r\nunventilated. Whatever after-damp is then and there generated exerts its\r\neffects in full, and those who cannot rush to the shaft are suffocated.\r\nIn the explosion at Risca it was declared by the surgeon to the pit that\r\nof those who were killed no less than seventy persons died from the\r\neffects of after-damp who had not been near the fire. In the great\r\nHaswell explosion, several years since, seventy-one deaths out of\r\nninety-five were occasioned by choke-damp; and at the explosion in the\r\nMiddle Dyffryn Pit in 1852 no less than seven-eighths of the deaths\r\nproceeded from this cause. Persons of great experience attribute at\r\nleast seventy per cent. of the deaths in fiery mines to after-damp,\r\nwhile some advance them even to ninety per cent.\r\n\r\nAfter relating so many frightful disasters, too frequently caused by\r\nimprudence and rashness, it is a more pleasing task to mention a few\r\ninstances of warnings taken in time. At Walker Colliery on the Tyne, in\r\nthe year 1846, a huge mass of coal weighing about eleven tons was forced\r\nfrom its bed, and a great discharge of gas succeeded. Two men who were\r\nfurnished with Davy lamps were working where this discharge took place;\r\none of them had his lamp covered with the falling coal, and the other\r\nhad his extinguished. They groped their way to warn the other miners,\r\nand then all, extinguishing their lamps as they went, safely escaped to\r\nthe bottom of the shaft, and were drawn up.\r\n\r\nA few months after a second discharge from another part of the same\r\ncolliery took place. A bore-hole having been made, a violent noise like\r\nthe blowing off of steam was heard, and a heavy discharge of gas filled\r\nthe air courses for a distance of 641 yards and over an area of 86,306\r\ncubic feet. At 400 yards from the point of efflux a mining officer met\r\nthe foul air, felt it blowing against him, saw the safety-lamp in his\r\nhand enlarge its flame, and drew down the wick. Still the gas continued\r\nto burn in his lamp for ten minutes, making the wires red hot, and then\r\nthe light went out—a hint not lost on the owner, who quickly followed\r\nits example. At a distance of 641 yards from the efflux of the gas he\r\nmet four men and boys whose lamps were rapidly reddening. At once they\r\nhad the self-possession to immerse them in water, and thus escaped all\r\ndanger of explosion.\r\n\r\nThe disastrous effects of the fire-damp are not confined to the loss of\r\nhuman life; they are also extremely injurious to the workings, tearing\r\nup galleries, shattering machinery, or even setting fire to the mine—an\r\naccident which may also be caused by spontaneous combustion[41] or by\r\nthe negligence of the workmen. These fires are often subdued by\r\nisolating the burning coal seam, by means of dams or clay walls, or by\r\nfilling the mine with water; but not seldom they last for years, and\r\nassume dimensions which mock all human efforts to extinguish them.\r\n\r\nFootnote 41:\r\n\r\n  Experience has proved that when sulphuret of iron undergoes a chemical\r\n  change into vitriol it disengages a sufficient quantity of heat to set\r\n  fire to the coal with which it is often found mixed.\r\n\r\nAt Brûlé, near St. Etienne, a coal mine has been on fire for ages. The\r\nsoil on the surface is barren and calcined, and the dense sulphurous\r\nfumes, escaping from innumerable crevices, give the country a complete\r\nvolcanic aspect.\r\n\r\nIn the carboniferous basins of Staffordshire and of Saarbrück and\r\nSilesia there are likewise coal mines which have been on fire for a long\r\nperiod. At Zwickau in Saxony the first accounts of one of these\r\nsubterranean conflagrations date as far back as the fifteenth century,\r\nand the fire still burns on. The hot vapours which rise from the surface\r\nhave since 1837 been put to an ingenious use. Conducted through pipes\r\ninto conservatories, they ripen the choicest fruits of the south, and\r\nproduce a tropical climate under a northern sky.\r\n\r\nIn a Staffordshire colliery which had been on fire for many years, and\r\nwhich was called by the inhabitants Burning Hill, it was noticed that\r\nthe snow melted on reaching the ground, and that the grass in the\r\nmeadows was always green. Some speculators conceived the idea of\r\nestablishing a school of horticulture on the spot, and imported colonial\r\nplants at a heavy expense. These flourished for a time, but one day the\r\nsubterranean fire went out, and as the heat it had imparted to the soil\r\ngradually diminished and departed, the exotic vegetation likewise\r\ndrooped and died.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXIV.\r\n                                 GOLD.\r\n\r\nThe Golden Fleece—Golden Statues in ancient Temples—A Free-thinking\r\n  Soldier—Treasures of ancient Monarchs—First Gold Coins—Ophir—Spanish\r\n  Gold Mines—Bohemian Gold Mines—Discovery of America—Siberian Gold\r\n  Mines—California—Marshall—Rush to the Placers—Discovery of Gold in\r\n  Australia—The Chinaman’s Hole—New Eldorados—Alluvial Gold Deposits in\r\n  California and Australia—Washing—Quartz-crushing.\r\n\r\n\r\nGold is probably the metal which has been longest known to man. For as\r\nit is found only in the metallic state, its weight and brilliancy most\r\nnaturally have attracted attention or awakened greed at a very early\r\nage. Thus we read in the Bible that one of the rivers flowing from\r\nParadise ‘compasseth the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold, and\r\nthe gold of that land is good.’ Gold is also mentioned among the riches\r\nof Abraham, and when the patriarch’s servant met Rebekah at the fountain\r\nof Nahor, he presented the damsel with a ‘golden earring of half a\r\nshekel weight, and two bracelets for her hands of ten shekels weight of\r\ngold,’ undoubtedly the first trinkets on record.\r\n\r\nThe mythical history of Greece has likewise been thought to point to a\r\nvery ancient knowledge of gold, and the story of the search for the\r\n‘Golden Fleece’ has by some been explained as an expedition undertaken\r\nin quest of the metal; for the use of sheepskins or woollen coverings,\r\nto collect and retain the minutest particles of gold during the\r\noperation of washing, is common in many auriferous countries. From the\r\ngreat value which the ancient nations attached to its possession, gold\r\nwas largely used for the decoration of their temples, and many of their\r\nidols were made of gold. Such, among others, was the image of Belus,\r\nseated on a golden throne in the great temple of Babylon; that of Apollo\r\nat Delphi, and the magnificent statue of the Olympian Zeus, composed, by\r\nthe hand of Phidias, of ivory and gold, and still less remarkable for\r\nits costly materials than for the consummate beauty of its workmanship.\r\n\r\nPliny relates that a massive golden statue of the goddess Anaitis was\r\ntaken by Marc Antony in his war against the Parthians. The Emperor\r\nAugustus, dining one day at Bononia with an old veteran who had taken\r\npart in the campaign, asked him whether it was true that the\r\nsacrilegious soldier who had first laid hands on the goddess had been\r\nsuddenly deprived of the use of his eyes and limbs, and had thus\r\nmiserably perished. ‘I myself am the man,’ answered the smiling host;\r\n‘you are dining from off her thigh, and to her am I indebted for all the\r\nplate in my possession.’\r\n\r\nThe wealth of monarchs was estimated less by the extent of their domains\r\nthan by the gold which they possessed, and as each successive conqueror\r\nadded to the spoils of vanquished nations, the treasures accumulated by\r\nsingle despots grew to an almost fabulous amount. Every schoolboy knows\r\nthat the vast treasures of Crœsus fell into the hands of Cyrus, who,\r\naccording to the rather questionable authority of Pliny, acquired in\r\nAsia Minor no less than 24,000 pounds weight of gold, without reckoning\r\nthe vases and the wrought metal. To this treasure his son Cambyses added\r\nthe gold of Egypt, and Darius Hystaspis the tribute of the frontier\r\nnations of India. Thus the gold of almost the whole known world was\r\naccumulated in one single hoard, which, after the taking of Persepolis,\r\nfell into the hands of Alexander the Great. Plutarch relates that 10,000\r\nteams of mules and 500 camels were needed for the transport of this\r\nwealth to Susa, where Alexander was cheated out of a great part of it by\r\nhis treasurer. Rome, the subsequent mistress of the world, naturally\r\nabsorbed the greater part of the riches of Tyre and Carthage, of Asia\r\nand Egypt. Sixty-six years after the third Punic war the public treasury\r\ncontained 1,620,831 pounds weight of gold, and still greater wealth was\r\naccumulated under the Cæsars. As the empire declined, the hoards amassed\r\nin the times of its increasing power were once more dispersed. A\r\nconsiderable part, however, found its way to Constantinople, and after\r\nmany a loss, caused by the repeated disasters of a thousand years, the\r\nremnant fell at length into the hands of the victorious Turks.\r\n\r\nThe time when gold was first coined is unknown. The oldest specimen in\r\nthe Imperial Cabinet at Vienna is from Cyzicus, a town of Mysia, and\r\nbears the date of the seventh century before Christ; the next coin in\r\npoint of antiquity is Persian, and was probably struck under the reign\r\nof Cyrus. According to Pliny, gold was first coined by the Romans in the\r\nyear 547 after the foundation of the city. During the empire of the\r\nChalifes Abuschafar-al-Monsur established a mint at Bagdad, in which\r\nsilver coins (dirhems) and gold coins (dinars)[42] were struck. The\r\nVisigoths in Spain likewise had golden coins; but in the other western\r\nmediæval States they first appear, after a long interval, under Lewis\r\nthe Pious, son of Charlemagne, in Venice, in 1290; and in Bohemia, under\r\nJohn of Luxembourg. The gold of the Carolingian monarch probably\r\nproceeded from the spoils of the old west Roman Empire; that of the\r\nVenetians (zecchins or ducats) was, no doubt, obtained, like that of the\r\nPhœnicians of old, by trading with the gold countries of Africa and of\r\nthe distant East. The Florentines, the rivals of Venice, likewise\r\nobtained wealth by trade, and struck gold coins, which, from their being\r\nstamped with a flower, the arms of Florence, were called fiorini, or\r\nflorins.\r\n\r\nFootnote 42:\r\n\r\n  These names were borrowed from the Greek Drachma and the Latin\r\n  Denarius.\r\n\r\nThe coins of the kings of Bohemia were made from indigenous gold. It is\r\nhardly necessary to remark that since those times the use of gold coins\r\nhas been constantly increasing with the progress of trade and\r\ncivilisation; but even now, in many African and Asiatic countries which\r\npossess large quantities of gold, no coins are struck, but the metal is\r\nweighed, and thus serves as a medium of exchange, in the same manner as\r\nin the times of Abraham or Jacob.\r\n\r\nThe countries from which the ancients obtained their chief supply of\r\ngold were the Indian Highlands, Colchis, and Africa. The seat of Ophir,\r\nwhich furnished this precious metal to the Phœnician and Jewish traders,\r\nis unknown. While some authorities place it on the east coast of Africa,\r\nothers fix its situation somewhere on the west coast of the Indian\r\npeninsula; and Humboldt is even of opinion that the name had only a\r\ngeneral signification, and that a voyage to Ophir meant no more than a\r\ncommercial expedition to any of the coasts or isles of the Indian Ocean,\r\njust as at present we speak of a voyage to the Levant or the West\r\nIndies. The golden sands over which the Pactolus, a small river of\r\nLydia, rolled, gave rise, it has been said, to the wealth of Crœsus.\r\n\r\nThe richest auriferous land in Europe was the Iberian peninsula, which\r\nfor centuries yielded a golden harvest, first to the Carthaginians, then\r\nto the Romans, and at a still later period to the Visigoths and the\r\nMoors. During the middle ages Bohemia was renowned for its gold, and the\r\naccounts that have reached us of the times when her auriferous deposits\r\nfirst began to be extensively worked remind us of the scenes which our\r\nown age has witnessed in California or Australia. Bloody conflicts\r\nfrequently arose between gold-diggers and peasants because the former\r\ndevastated the fields and meadows and left them permanently sterile.\r\nEven now in many parts of the country long ranges of sand hillocks and\r\nrubbish mounds remain as memorials of the mediæval gold-diggers.\r\nFrequent famines arose in the land, as many of the inhabitants gave up\r\nagriculture for mining.\r\n\r\nA new epoch in the history of gold began with the discovery of America.\r\nWe all know by what prodigies of valour the Spaniards obtained\r\npossession of the treasures of Montezuma and of the Peruvian Incas, and\r\nhow frequently acts of a fiendish cruelty, inspired by the love of gold,\r\nand aggravated by a bloodthirsty fanaticism, tarnished the lustre of\r\ntheir arms.\r\n\r\nMore recently, about the year 1836, rich deposits of auriferous sand\r\nwere discovered in Siberia, and soon raised the frozen regions of the\r\nJenisei to the rank of the first gold-producing country in the\r\nworld.[43] But the fame of the Russian mines was soon eclipsed by the\r\neventful discovery of the Californian placers.\r\n\r\nFootnote 43:\r\n\r\n  ‘The Polar World,’ p. 231.\r\n\r\nIt was in January 1848, a short time after the incorporation of the\r\nprovince with the United States, that one James Marshall, who had\r\ncontracted to build a saw-mill on the land of Captain Sutter, about\r\nsixty miles east of Sacramento, discovered the glittering particles in\r\nthe mud of the brook on which he was at work. Trembling with excitement,\r\nhe hurried to his employer, and told his story. Captain Sutter at first\r\nthought it was a fiction, or the wild dream of a maniac; but his doubts\r\nwere soon at an end when Marshall laid on the table before him a few\r\nounces of the shining dust. The two agreed to keep the matter secret,\r\nand quietly to share the golden harvest between them. But, as they\r\nafterwards searched more narrowly, their eager gestures and looks\r\nhappened to be closely watched by a Mormon labourer employed about the\r\nneighbourhood. He followed their movements, and the secret was speedily\r\ndivulged.\r\n\r\nIt appears that Marshall did not escape the ordinary lot of discoverers,\r\nfor a few years later he was wandering, poor and homeless, over the land\r\nwhich was first indebted to him for its enormous development.\r\n\r\nThe intelligence of the Californian gold treasures soon spread over the\r\nworld, and a wonderful flood of immigration began into the newly-\r\nproclaimed Eldorado. An innumerable crowd of adventurers from every part\r\nof the New World, from the Sandwich Islands, from Europe, from\r\nAustralia, came pouring in over the Rocky Mountains, through Mexico,\r\nround Cape Horn, or across the Pacific, all eager to seize fortune in a\r\nbound or to perish in the attempt. Every week dispatched its thousands\r\nto the diggings, and saw its hundreds of successful adventurers return\r\nto dissipate their earnings in the gambling saloons of the infant\r\nmetropolis. In less than ten years California numbered more than half a\r\nmillion of inhabitants, and San Francisco, from an obscure hamlet, had\r\nrisen to the rank of one of the great commercial emporiums of the world.\r\n\r\nScience had little to do with the discovery of gold in California; but\r\nthe case was different in Australia. As early as 1844 Sir Roderick\r\nMurchison directed attention to the remarkable resemblance between the\r\nAustralian cordillera and the auriferous Uralian chain. Two years later,\r\nhis surmises about the hidden treasures of that distant colony were\r\nconfirmed by some samples of auriferous quartz sent to him from\r\nAustralia. Relying upon this fact, he advised some Cornish emigrants to\r\nchoose Australia for their new home, and to seek for gold among the\r\n_débris_ of the primitive rocks. His opinion having become known at\r\nSydney, through the newspapers, researches were made, which proved so\r\nfar successful that in 1848 gold was found in several places in South\r\nAustralia.\r\n\r\nThe first important discovery was, however, not made before the year\r\n1851, when Mr. Hargraves made known to Government that rich gold\r\ndeposits were situated to the north-west of Bathurst, on the Summerhill\r\nand Lewis rivulets, which flow into the Macquarie. When the geological\r\nGovernment inspector arrived at Summerhill Creek, on May 19, he found\r\nthat about four hundred persons had already assembled there, who,\r\nwithout any other mining apparatus than a shovel and a simple tin pot,\r\ngained, on an average, from one to two ounces of gold daily.\r\n\r\nSoon after, still richer deposits were found near the Turon and the\r\nMeroo, two other branches of the Macquarie. Here a native shepherd, in\r\nthe service of Dr. Kerr, found three quartz blocks, of which the largest\r\ncontained sixty pounds weight of pure gold. It may easily be supposed\r\nthat the whole neighbourhood became at once the scene of active\r\nresearches, which at first proved fruitless, until at length a fourth\r\nquartz block was discovered, and publicly sold for a thousand pounds.\r\nOther discoveries were made within the bounds of New South Wales; but\r\neven the richest of them were soon to be obscured by the treasures of\r\nthe neighbouring colony.\r\n\r\nAs late as 1836 Port Philip had remained an unknown land, for it was not\r\nuntil then that its first settlers, attracted by the richness of the\r\npastures, arrived from Tasmania. Soon a small town arose on the Yarra-\r\nYarra, and, though badly chosen as a port, Melbourne soon rose to\r\nimportance. In 1850 the district was made an independent colony, which\r\nreceived the name of Victoria. Here the traders and sheep-drivers now\r\nmourned over the news from Sydney. The best workmen had already left for\r\nthe gold-fields, and if the exodus went on increasing, nothing remained\r\nfor them but to follow the example, or quietly to await the ruin of\r\ntheir hopes—a patience which agrees but little with the Anglo-Saxon\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nTo prevent the impending evil, a reward of 200 guineas was immediately\r\nset upon the discovery of a gold-field within 120 miles from Melbourne,\r\nand soon after the world was astonished by the intelligence of the\r\nfabulous riches of Ballarat, at the source of the River Lea. The first\r\nconsequence of this discovery was that the towns of Geelong and\r\nMelbourne, both not above sixty miles from Ballarat, were immediately\r\ndeserted by their inhabitants, and that, within a few weeks, more than\r\n3,000 gold-diggers had collected on the spot, who were gaining, on an\r\naverage, their ten or twenty pounds a day. But here also there was no\r\ndefinite resting-place, for new prospects of dazzling wealth constantly\r\nallured the crowd to new and still more distant fields of enterprise.\r\nTwenty thousand people, meeting with fair success, would migrate in a\r\nday, abandon their claims, and rush upon the new tract. The passions of\r\nhuman nature were roused by one of the strongest of its instincts; and\r\nmadness and suicide, arising from excess of joy and wild despair, were\r\nfar from uncommon occurrences. The whole order of society was inverted,\r\nand the labourer became of more importance than the employer of labour.\r\nThe scum of the adjoining colonies boiled over and deluged the land with\r\nvice and crime. Bush-ranging extended over every portion of the country,\r\nand even the streets of Melbourne became the scenes of robbery and\r\nmurder. The diggers were of all nations: Germans, French, Italians,\r\nAmerican-Irish, Californians, and Chinese—these last being the best\r\nconducted of this motley population, who as early as 1860 numbered\r\n50,000. To this strange people one of the most remarkable of the\r\nAustralian gold discoveries is due. The immigration-tax, which had been\r\nvainly devised to check their influx (for they are objects of the\r\ngreatest antipathy to the white gold-diggers), drove them to a\r\nsurreptitious mode of entering the colony; and, landing at Gurchen Bay\r\nin South Australia, and taking a course thence over the frontier across\r\nthe Grampian ranges, they came upon a deposit of marvellous richness, in\r\nthe neighbourhood of Mount Ararat. In one of their first encampments,\r\nwhile picking up the roots of grass and prying for gold, they found the\r\ncelebrated ‘Chinaman’s Hole,’ which yielded 3,000 ounces in a few hours.\r\nThis led to the greatest rush which had ever been known in the gold-\r\nfields, for 60,000 people congregated there in a few weeks, and before a\r\nmonth had elapsed an immense town was systematically laid out. Shops,\r\ntaverns and hotels, theatres and billiard-rooms, sprang up in the\r\ndesert, like the mystic trees of Indian jugglers, and were quickly\r\nfollowed by a daily mail and a daily newspaper. Thus, within the space\r\nof two months, the magical power of gold converted a wild mountain gorge\r\ninto a teeming city, where frontages were nearly as valuable as in the\r\nheart of London.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GOLD-WASHING IN AUSTRALIA.]\r\n\r\nThe great social disorganisation which distinguished the first few years\r\nof the Australian gold discoveries has long since passed away, together\r\nwith much of the excitement natural to a transition state. Order now\r\nuniversally prevails, and the occupations of life are pursued with as\r\nmuch regularity as in the oldest States. The growth of the colony, which\r\nscarcely thirty years since was a mere unknown waste, is not the least\r\nmarvellous of the many marvels that have been worked by gold. In the\r\nyear 1851 the population of the province was 77,345 persons, of whom\r\n28,143 were located in Melbourne. In 1860, it had already increased to\r\n462,000, and probably the next few years will find it augmented to a\r\nmillion, while Melbourne already rivals our larger cities in size and\r\nwealth.\r\n\r\nThe wonderful discoveries in California and Australia having made gold\r\nthe all-absorbing topic of the day, it is not surprising that new\r\nEldorados were now eagerly sought for wherever the geological formation\r\nof a country held out the hope of similar treasures.\r\n\r\nFresh and highly-productive gold-fields have, within the last few years,\r\nbeen opened in British Columbia, and, still further to the north, in the\r\nArctic wilds of the infant colony of Stikeen. Numerous diggers are at\r\nwork in New Zealand, and in the deserts to the north of the Cape. A\r\nsystem of auriferous veins has been discovered in North Wales; the\r\ncounty of Sutherland, the Ultima Thule of our isle, claims to be ranked\r\namong the gold-producing regions; and numerous adventurers are on their\r\nway to the frozen deserts of Lapland, where the glittering metal is said\r\nto abound in the basin of the Ivalo.\r\n\r\nAt no former period of the world’s history has gold been so eagerly\r\nsought for over such extensive areas in all parts of the globe; never\r\nhave larger quantities of the precious metal been added to the\r\naccumulated hoards of ages. No doubt this vast influx of wealth has in\r\nmany cases been productive of evil consequences; but its beneficial\r\ninfluence upon the progress and happiness of mankind far outweighs the\r\ninjury it may too frequently have caused by rousing the worst passions\r\nof our nature. An astonishing impetus has already been given to commerce\r\nand industry; competence and wealth have been diffused over many lands;\r\ndeserts have been transformed into growing empires; and a vast\r\ncontinent, long despised as the convict’s prison, has been raised in the\r\nsocial scale to a height almost commensurate with its geographical\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\nThe mineral formations in which gold originally occurs are the\r\ncrystalline primitive rocks, the compact transition rocks, and the\r\ntrachytic and trap rocks, which, by their disintegration have, in the\r\ncourse of ages, enriched large alluvial tracts with particles of the\r\nprecious metal. Torrents and rivers washed them down from the heights,\r\nalong with the worthless rubbish of their original matrix, and finally\r\ndeposited them in the gulleys and ravines of the lower grounds. Hence\r\nthe alluvial territories have always been the chief sources of\r\nauriferous wealth, and this circumstance explains how countries which at\r\none time abounded in gold have long since ceased to be of importance.\r\nFor the comparative ease with which the metal could generally be\r\nobtained by digging and washing, and the greed which stimulated the\r\nresearches of thousands, could not fail to exhaust even the richest\r\nplacers. No one now dreams of searching for gold in the sands of the\r\nPactolus or of the Golden Tagus; no modern Argonaut sails to Colchis in\r\nquest of the golden fleece; the fields of Bohemia are no longer\r\nransacked by gold-seekers; and a like fate probably awaits many of our\r\nmodern Eldorados.\r\n\r\nA marked difference between the gold deposits of Australia and\r\nCalifornia deserves to be noticed. The gold of California is found in\r\nthe midst of, or contiguous to, the existing great mountain ranges,\r\namidst regions of peaked, jagged, irregular crests, and upheaved and\r\ndistorted strata, the undoubted effects of internal convulsions. It has\r\nnot, however, selected as its resting-place the smooth levels and\r\nhanging slopes of the contiguous hills. The metal, ground finer and\r\nfiner as it is carried forward by the torrents that year after year tear\r\nup the river-beds, finally settles in the form of fine flakes or dust\r\nalong the banks and at the bottoms of the great streams of the country.\r\nHence the Californian diggers generally find the drifts of the precious\r\nmetal in the strata immediately under the surface, either associated\r\nwith the subsoil, or in the holes or ‘pockets’ of water-worn rocks.\r\n\r\nIn Victoria the most prolific gold-fields are in regions where the old\r\nformations are pierced by igneous rocks which have flowed from extinct\r\nvolcanoes; and some of the richest alluvial deposits have been found on\r\nthe pipe-clay bottom of flat, wide-spread plains, or settled in great\r\nsubterranean gutters, under broad, elongated slopes, which the miner can\r\nreach only by sinking his shaft through stratum after stratum, from\r\nfifty to three hundred feet down, before he reaches the buried treasure.\r\nThe inference necessarily is that much of the gold-drift of Australia is\r\nof an earlier origin than the deposits of California, which are the\r\nproducts of the existing mountain ranges, and therefore will be\r\nexhausted in a comparatively brief period.\r\n\r\nIn Victoria, not seldom three distinct auriferous deposits, the result\r\nof successive upheavals and depressions, occur in the same locality; and\r\nthe miner finds, in the course of his working, a first, second, and\r\nthird bottom, the last being always on the solid and unmoved palæozoic\r\nrock, from which all the gold has been derived.\r\n\r\nRich as the auriferous drifts of the deep alluvial deposits are\r\nfrequently found to be, they must be within definite limits, having been\r\ndeposited by currents and the continuous action of waves not far from\r\nthe localities where the gold was originally formed. But the alluvial\r\ngold of Victoria and New South Wales is not confined to drifts and\r\ngutters. There are hundreds, probably thousands, of square miles, where\r\nthe clay, earth, and sand are impregnated with gold in sufficient\r\nquantities to pay well for washing. Besides these deposits of\r\nincalculable wealth, there are vast reserves of gold locked up in the\r\ngreat mountain ranges both of Victoria and New South Wales, the hidden\r\nwealth of which will eventually be brought to light by systematic\r\nmining.\r\n\r\nAs even the richest auriferous drift would be comparatively worthless\r\nwithout the assistance of water, the diversion of a running stream\r\nthrough a ‘placer’ is often one of the most laborious undertakings of\r\nthe gold-digger.\r\n\r\nPliny speaks of ‘the bringing of the rivers from the mountains, in many\r\ninstances for a hundred miles, for the purpose of washing the _débris_,’\r\nand this method of hydraulic mining is now carried on in California on a\r\nstupendous scale. Thus, north of Mariposa County, the thick deposits,\r\noften semi-indurated, are now washed down by vast streams of water\r\n(thrown by the pressure of a column of water of 150 feet), that do the\r\nwork of running off the earth and gravel and gathering the gold in an\r\nincredibly short time.\r\n\r\nThe ores of auriferous quartz are treated in a different way from the\r\nalluvial _débris_. After having been crushed and pulverised by powerful\r\nmachinery, the finely powdered quartz is then treated with mercury, a\r\nmethod well known to the ancients. This metal dissolves out the gold,\r\nproducing an amalgam, which, by straining and distillation, yields the\r\ngold.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXV.\r\n                                SILVER.\r\n\r\nIts ancient Discovery—Its uses among the luxurious Romans—The Mines of\r\n  Laurium—Silver Mines of Bohemia, Saxony, and Hungary—Colossal Nuggets—\r\n  Silver Ores—Silver Production of Europe—Mexican Silver Mines—The Veta\r\n  Madre of Guanaxuato—The Conde de la Valenciana—Zacatecas and Catorce—\r\n  Adventures of a Steam-engine—La Bolsa de Dios Padre—The Conde de la\r\n  Regla—Ill-fated English Companies—Indian Carriers—The Dressing of\r\n  Silver Ores—Amalgamating Process—Enormous Production of Mexican Mines—\r\n  Potosi—Cerro de Pasco—Gualgayoc—The Mine of Salcedo—Hostility of the\r\n  Indians—The Monk’s Rosary—Chilian Mines—The Comstock Lode.\r\n\r\n\r\nLike that of gold, the first discovery of silver precedes the historic\r\ntimes, and must no doubt be sought for in the remotest antiquity; for as\r\nit is not seldom found in a native state, its brilliancy could not fail\r\nto attract attention at a very early age. Veins of silver ore, moreover,\r\nnot seldom crop out on the surface, a circumstance which likewise\r\ngreatly facilitated the accidental discovery of the metal. Thus Diodorus\r\nrelates that streams of melted silver flowed out of the calcined soil\r\nwhere some shepherds had set fire to a forest in the Pyrenees. The\r\ncunning Phœnician merchants, who were trading in the neighbourhood,\r\nbought the metal for a trifle from the natives, who, ignorant of its\r\nvalue, gladly exchanged it for some worthless trinkets.\r\n\r\nOur earliest annals show us silver in common use among the more polished\r\nnations of antiquity, both for ornamental purposes and as a means of\r\nexchange. When we read in the Bible that Abraham weighed to Ephron the\r\nHittite ‘four hundred shekels of silver, _current money_ with the\r\nmerchant’ for the purchase of the field of Machpelah, where Sarah was\r\nburied, we cannot possibly doubt that, long before the patriarch’s time,\r\ngreat quantities of silver must have circulated among the traders of the\r\nEast, and that even then it belonged to the discoveries of ancient days.\r\n\r\nHomer describes the shields and helmets of his heroes as inlaid with\r\nsilver, and in Northern Asia silver ornaments have been found in the\r\ntumuli of the Tschudi, a mysterious people who have left no vestiges of\r\ntheir existence save their tombs.\r\n\r\nThe Babylonian, Assyrian, and Persian monarchs imposed large tributes of\r\nsilver on the conquered nations of Asia, and at a later period the\r\ntreasures thus amassed by a long line of despots came into the\r\npossession of Alexander the Great, and finally of the Romans, who\r\nabsorbed all the riches of Carthage and the East. In the reign of\r\nAugustus, the tables of the wealthy senators groaned under silver dishes\r\nweighing from one hundred to five hundred pounds; silver statues of\r\ntheir ancestors decorated their apartments, and they not seldom\r\nperformed their luxurious ablutions in baths of silver. Mirrors of this\r\nmetal were in frequent use among a people to whom the art of applying a\r\nlustrous amalgam to the back of a plate of glass was unknown.\r\n\r\nThe skill of the artist not seldom added an inestimable value to the\r\nintrinsic worth of an embossed or chiselled silver vase, and Pliny\r\nmentions several works of this kind which enjoyed a world-wide\r\ncelebrity.\r\n\r\nThe most ancient silver mines of which we have any historical account\r\nwere situated in the mountainous parts of Chaldæa and in Spain. With the\r\ndevelopment of the Grecian States, Eastern Europe also began to furnish\r\nits contingent. Silver mines were discovered and worked in the Pangæan\r\nMountains, between Macedonia and Thrace, in the islands of Siphnos and\r\nCyprus. Athens derived a considerable part of its revenue from the mines\r\nof Laurium in Attica. At first the profits derived from this source were\r\ndistributed among the citizens, until Themistocles persuaded the general\r\nassembly of the people to devote them to the construction of ships of\r\nwar. The battle of Salamis was won by the galleys built with the money\r\nthus obtained, so that the silver mines of Laurium have been the means\r\nof adding some of its brightest pages to the history of Ancient Greece.\r\n\r\nAfter the fall of the Roman Empire, the exhausted or neglected mines of\r\nthe East, and of the Iberian peninsula, ceased to be the sources from\r\nwhich silver flowed over the world.\r\n\r\nThe riches amassed during ages of civilisation were now scattered among\r\nbarbarous hordes, or buried in the ruins of cities destroyed by fire;\r\nand as no new influx replaced the losses caused by accident or the slow\r\nwear of time, the precious metals gradually became more rare and of\r\nincreasing value, until Germany began to open a new era in mining\r\nhistory, and for a time to take the lead among the silver-producing\r\ncountries of the globe. The first discovery of this metal in Bohemia\r\ndates back as far as the seventh century; and in the tenth the\r\nRammelsberg in the Hartz Mountains began to yield its still unexhausted\r\ntreasures. In the twelfth century the silver mines of Saxony and Hungary\r\nwere discovered, and at a much later period those of Kongsberg in\r\nNorway.\r\n\r\nMany of these deposits are remarkable for the richness of their ores,\r\nand for the large masses of native or crystallised silver which they\r\nhave sometimes yielded. From the mine of Himmelsfürst, near Freiberg in\r\nSaxony, lumps or nuggets weighing above a hundred pounds have more than\r\nonce been extracted. The largest single block ever known was discovered\r\nat Schneeberg, in the Saxon Erzgebirge, in the year 1477. It consisted\r\nof silver-glance and native silver, and measured no less than seven\r\nyards in length and three and a half in width. On hearing of this\r\nmagnificent prize, Duke Albrecht of Saxony visited the mine, where he\r\neat his dinner from the block. Agricola Bermannus relates that, during\r\nthe repast, he exclaimed, ‘Frederick is a wealthy and powerful emperor,\r\nbut he has never dined from a table such as this.’ The subsequent\r\nsmelting of this wonderful mass produced 40,000 pounds of solid silver.\r\n\r\nLarge nuggets of solid silver have likewise been found at Kongsberg. A\r\nblock weighing 560 pounds, which was discovered in 1666, is still\r\npreserved as a curiosity in the Copenhagen Museum; and as a convincing\r\nproof that the ancient riches of these northern mines are not yet\r\nexhausted, a still larger block, weighing 750 pounds, was disinterred as\r\nlate as the year 1834.\r\n\r\nThough native silver is found in many localities, our chief supply of\r\nthe precious metal is derived from the ores in which it is found\r\ncombined with other substances, such as silver-glance (sulphuret of\r\nsilver); antimonial silver; red-silver (sulphuret of silver and\r\nantimony); horn silver (chloride of silver), &c. A considerable quantity\r\nis likewise obtained as an accessory product from the lead mines, by\r\nseparating it from the galena or lead-glance, which usually contains a\r\nsmall percentage of silver.\r\n\r\nAt present the mines of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, which in the year\r\n1851 produced 122,950 marks of silver, are the richest in Europe. In\r\nBohemia the mines of Birkenberg, near Przibram, yield on an average\r\n40,000 marks a year, considerably more than the celebrated mine of\r\nSchemnitz in Hungary, which in the year 1854 produced 26,064 marks.\r\n\r\nPrussia obtains from her mines in the Hartz Mountains in Nassau and the\r\ncounty of Mansfeld about 100,000 marks; and the kingdom of Saxony,\r\nwhich, in proportion to its small extent, holds the first rank among the\r\nsilver-producing countries of Europe, produces annually about 53,000\r\nmarks. In Great Britain, silver is accessorily obtained from the lead\r\nmines, to an amount of about 80,000 marks per annum. France produces\r\n26,800 marks, Sweden and Norway 6,000 marks, and Italy 4,500; while\r\nSpain, which in ancient times enriched Tyre and Carthage with the rich\r\nproduce of her silver mines, yields at present but an insignificant\r\nquantity.\r\n\r\nOn adding together the various sums above mentioned, we find that,\r\nexclusively of the Russian Empire, which obtains the greater part of its\r\nsilver (about 65,000 marks a year) from the Altai Mountains in Siberia,\r\nthe whole annual production of Europe may be estimated at about 400,000\r\nmarks.\r\n\r\nThis quantity, large as it is, sinks into comparative insignificance\r\nwhen compared with the enormous masses of silver with which, ever since\r\ntheir discovery and conquest by Cortez and Pizarro, Mexico and Peru have\r\nenriched the world.\r\n\r\nThe Mexican silver mines, which deserve a particular notice from the\r\nimmensity of their produce and the interesting details with which their\r\nhistory abounds, are mostly situated on the back or on the western\r\nslopes of the Cordillera of Anahuac at elevations which sometimes\r\napproach the line of perpetual snow. But little is known of their first\r\nhistory. The lodes of Tasco and Pachuca appear to have been worked soon\r\nafter the conquest, and in 1548, twenty-eight years after the death of\r\nMontezuma, the mines of Zacatecas were opened, though situated above 400\r\nmiles from the capital. Muleteers travelling from Mexico to Zacatecas\r\nare said to have discovered the silver mines of Guanaxuato.\r\n\r\nMany of my readers will no doubt be surprised to hear that the Mexican\r\nsilver ores are generally poor. On an average they contain only from\r\nthree to four ounces of silver per cwt., much less than the ores of\r\nAnnaberg, Marienberg, and other districts of Saxony. Their comparative\r\npoverty is, however, amply redeemed by their abundance and the facility\r\nwith which they are worked.\r\n\r\nAfter these preliminary remarks I will now briefly describe the chief\r\nMexican silver mines. The Sierra de Santa Rosa, a group of porphyritic\r\nhills, rises in the centre of the province of Guanaxuato. Partly arid\r\nand partly covered with the evergreen oak, it attains an absolute height\r\nof from 8,000 to 9,000 feet; but, as the neighbouring plain is nearly\r\n6,000 feet above the sea, it hardly attracts the notice of the traveller\r\naccustomed to the vast proportions of the Andes.\r\n\r\nThe southern slope of this porphyritic range is crossed by the famous\r\nVeta Madre of Guanaxuato, the richest silver lode as yet discovered in\r\nMexico. This enormous vein, which traverses the country for upwards of\r\neight miles, with an average width of from 120 to 135 feet, is, however,\r\nnot productive throughout its whole extent, but the ore occurs in\r\nbranches and bunches, leaving intermediate spaces of dead and\r\nunproductive ground. Among the numerous mines that have been opened\r\nalong its course, the Valenciana exhibited, at the beginning of the\r\npresent century, the almost unparalleled example of a mine which, during\r\na period of more than forty years, never yielded its proprietors less\r\nthan an annual income of from 80,000_l._ to 120,000_l._ The part of the\r\nVeta in which it is situated had remained unexplored till 1760, when\r\nObregon, a young Spaniard, began to work it, with the assistance of some\r\nfriends who advanced him the necessary capital. In the year 1766 the\r\ndiggings had reached a depth of 240 feet, and the expenses were far\r\ngreater than the proceeds. But Obregon clung with the passionate ardour\r\nof a gambler to the hazardous enterprise on which he had staked all his\r\nhopes of fortune. In 1767 he entered into partnership with a small\r\nshopkeeper, Otero, who was destined soon to share the fabulous riches\r\nthat were about to reward his perseverance. Already in the following\r\nyear the produce of the mine considerably increased, and in 1771 it\r\nbegan to yield enormous masses of sulphuret of silver. From that time\r\ntill 1804, when Humboldt left Mexico, it never produced less than\r\n560,000_l._ worth of silver annually, and the net profits of the\r\npartners amounted in some years to 240,000_l._\r\n\r\nUnder the title of Conde de la Valenciana, Obregon maintained the simple\r\nhabits and the urbanity of character which had distinguished him in\r\npoverty. When he began to work his mine, the goats were feeding on the\r\nspot where ten years later a thriving town of 8,000 souls had started\r\ninto existence. Guanaxuato, the capital of the State of the same name,\r\nis indebted to the neighbourhood of the richest silver mines in the\r\nworld for its origin and prosperity. Inclosed in a narrow valley, its\r\nhouses rise in terraces one above the other; and the contrast of the\r\nmagnificent abodes of the rich mining proprietors with the miserable\r\nhuts of their dependants adds to the singular appearance of the place.\r\nThe Mexican miner is, however, not so poor as his wretched dwelling\r\nmight lead us to suppose. In some measure he shares the fortunes of the\r\nproprietors of the mines, as he is entitled to part of the ore; so that\r\nwhen the vein is more than usually productive his weekly profits may\r\namount to as much as a hundred dollars. Yet he never thinks of\r\npurchasing a piece of land, or of repairing his hut, when favoured by\r\nfortune; but foolishly squanders his money in drinking and gambling, and\r\nseldom returns to his work before his last farthing has been spent.\r\n\r\nThe population of Guanaxuato naturally fluctuates with the prosperity of\r\nthe mines. In 1806 and 1807, when they were in the highest state of\r\nactivity, it amounted to 90,000 souls; during the wars of independence\r\nit sank to 20,000, but since then it has again risen to 60,000.\r\n\r\nNext to the mines of Guanaxuato those of Zacatecas are distinguished by\r\ntheir richness. They are likewise situated on the great central plateau\r\nof the Cordillera in a wild mountain region whose forbidding aspect\r\nforms a strange contrast to the riches concealed under its surface. In\r\n1826 the United Mexican and the Bolaños Company undertook the working of\r\nthese mines; and two years after, the latter had the good fortune to\r\nfind an exceedingly rich vein, which up to the year 1834 produced no\r\nless than 1,680,316 marks of silver.\r\n\r\nBefore 1770 the populous district of Alamos de Catorce in the State of\r\nSan Luis de Potosi, was still a complete desert. About this time a free\r\nnegro, named Milagros, who made a scant livelihood as an itinerant\r\nmusician, having lost his way, was obliged to pass the night in the\r\nforest. On the following morning he found a few drops of silver on the\r\nspot where he had made a fire, and, on a closer examination, discovered\r\nthe rich cropping out of a bed of argentiferous ores. He lost no time in\r\nestablishing the right of property which he derived from his discovery,\r\nand opened the shaft Milagros, which, in a few years, made him a wealthy\r\nman.\r\n\r\nSoon after Don Barnabé de Zepeda discovered the chief vein of Catorce—\r\nthe Veta Madre—which continued to be worked with great success until the\r\nrevolution. This event having proved as destructive to the draining\r\nmachines of Catorce as to those of Guanaxuato and Zacatecas, a contract\r\nwas made with an English house for the furnishing of a steam-engine, the\r\nfirst ever seen in Mexico. It was landed at Tampico in May 1822, but\r\narrived at Alamos six months later, as the carts which dragged the heavy\r\npiece of machinery broke down every moment on the wretched roads which\r\nlead to the central plateau on which the mines are situated. This,\r\nhowever, was but the prelude of new difficulties; for as the\r\nneighbouring forests could not furnish wood fit for the purpose, it was\r\nnecessary to order iron pump-tubes in England, which did not arrive\r\nbefore 1826, so that the engine could not be set to work until four\r\nyears had passed after its arrival in Mexico. The history of Catorce\r\naffords many remarkable examples of good fortune; but as most of the\r\nrich _mineros_ (mine-proprietors) were men of low birth and without\r\neducation, they squandered their treasures as fast as they acquired\r\nthem. Medellin, the proprietor of the mine Dolores, once spent 36,000\r\ndollars on a christening party; and at times, when the share of the\r\nhewers amounted to one-third of the extracted ores, a common miner would\r\nstake two or three thousand dollars on the issue of a cock-fight.\r\n\r\nAmong the first settlers at Catorce was an ecclesiastic named Flores,\r\nwho bought for 700 dollars a newly-opened mine, which received the\r\nsignificant name of ‘La Bolsa de Dios Padre,’ or ‘God the Father’s\r\nMoney-Bag.’\r\n\r\nNever was a small capital more profitably invested, for, at a depth of\r\nabout twenty yards, a deposit of such enormous richness was discovered\r\nthat in less than three years the profits of Padre Flores amounted to\r\nthree millions and a half of dollars.\r\n\r\nThe mines of Pachuca, Real del Monte, and Moran began to be worked soon\r\nafter the conquest. The Veta de la Biscayna, the chief vein of the\r\ndistrict, yielded immense profits from the sixteenth to the beginning of\r\nthe eighteenth century, when, in consequence of insufficient drainage,\r\nthe mines were drowned. An enterprising hidalgo, Don José Bustamente,\r\nthen began to drive a draining gallery, 7,000 feet long, which, however,\r\nwas only finished after his death by his partner, Don Pedro Terreros, a\r\nmerchant of Queretaro. Its immense cost was amply repaid, for Terreros\r\nextracted no less than fifteen millions of dollars from the mine, and\r\nwas ennobled under the title of Conde de la Regla. His liberality was\r\nworthy of his wealth, for besides a gift of two ships of the line—one of\r\nthem of 112 guns—to King Charles III. of Spain, he lent the court of\r\nMadrid a million of dollars, which, it is almost superfluous to remark,\r\nwere never repaid. He built the enormous factories of La Regla at a cost\r\nof more than 400,000_l_., and left his children a property rivalling\r\nthat of the Conde de la Valenciana. Since 1774, however, the profits of\r\nthe Biscayna, which was now worked 300 feet below the adit, began to\r\ndiminish; for though it still continued to yield enormous quantities of\r\nore, the water flowed in so abundantly that twenty-eight baritels,[44]\r\neach requiring forty horses, and worked at an expense of 2,000_l._ per\r\nweek, was incapable of mastering it. At the death of the old Conde the\r\nworks were abandoned, until 1791, when his heirs once more set all the\r\nbaritels in motion; but the proceeds not covering the expenses, the\r\nworks were again abandoned.\r\n\r\nFootnote 44:\r\n\r\n  A very primitive contrivance for raising the water in skin bags.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1824, when the frenzy of mining speculations was at its\r\nheight, a company was formed in London, with a capital of 400,000_l._,\r\nfor the purpose of working the mine of Tlalpujahua, in the State of\r\nMejoacan, which had long since been abandoned. Without any accurate\r\ninformation, a number of supervisors and workmen were sent to the spot\r\nin 1825, when they found all the mines under water. Yet, in spite of\r\nthis rather unpromising state of affairs, the company, not satisfied\r\nwith its first acquisitions, entered into new engagements, so that at\r\nthe end of 1825 it had contracted for no less than eighty mines, for\r\nwhich it bound itself to pay the proprietors annuities amounting to more\r\nthan 50,000 dollars during the first three years. Operations were now\r\nbegun in many places at once, but every one of them ended in\r\ndisappointment; and in 1828 the company, after spending every farthing\r\nof its capital, vanished into ‘airy nothing,’ abandoning the mines to\r\ntheir original proprietors, and leaving the ill-fated shareholders to\r\nmourn over their credulity and folly.\r\n\r\nSubsequently another English company undertook the working of the mines\r\nof Real del Monte, and after spending no less than 15,381,633 dollars,\r\nagainst a produce of 10,481,475 dollars, was dissolved in 1848. Mr.\r\nBuchan now undertook the management for a Mexican company, and almost\r\nimmediately struck the great Rosario vein, which opened a long career of\r\nprosperity, and yielded a profit of a million of dollars in 1867. Every\r\nfortnight a conducta, or escort, of one hundred and fifty armed men[45]\r\nconveys the silver, in bars of seventy pounds, inclosed in an iron safe,\r\nto the capital.\r\n\r\nFootnote 45:\r\n\r\n  _Illustrated London News_, No. 1477, Saturday, April 11, 1868.\r\n\r\nIt would be vain to seek in the Mexican mines for the scientific\r\narrangement which is to be found in most of the English or German\r\nsubterranean workings. One of their chief faults consists in a want of\r\ncommunication between their various parts, so that they resemble those\r\nill-arranged houses where, to go from one room to another, one is\r\nobliged to traverse long and crooked passages. Hence the impossibility\r\nof introducing in most of the mines an economical transport by means of\r\ntramroads and waggons, and hence also the necessity of conveying the ore\r\nto the surface by human labour. The native Indians, however, are\r\nadmirable carriers, for they will climb steep ladders, with 240 to 380\r\npounds, and perform this hard work for six hours consecutively. Their\r\nmuscular strength seemed truly astonishing to Humboldt, who, though\r\nhaving no weight to carry but his own, felt himself utterly exhausted\r\nafter ascending from a deep mine.\r\n\r\nMost of the Mexican silver is extracted from the ores by the process of\r\namalgamation. For this purpose the ore is first crushed either by\r\nrollers, or, more generally, by stamps, called in Mexico _molinos_,\r\nwhich in principle resemble those used in the tin mines of Cornwall, but\r\nare not so powerful, and are worked either by water-power or by mules.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STAMPING MILL.]\r\n\r\nThe crushed ores are then conveyed to the _arrastres_, or grinding-\r\nmills, which are usually arranged in rows in a large gallery or shed.\r\nThe ore, having been brought into a finely divided state, is next\r\nallowed to run out of the arrastre into shallow tanks or reservoirs,\r\nwhere it remains exposed to the sun until it has the appearance of thick\r\nmud, and in this state the process is proceeded with. The _lama_, as it\r\nis called, or slime, is now laid out on the _patio_, or amalgamation\r\nfloor (which is in some places boarded, and in others paved with flat\r\nstones), in large masses called _tortas_, from forty to fifty feet in\r\ndiameter, and about a foot thick; and so extensive are the floors that a\r\nlarge number of these tortas are seen in progress at the same time. When\r\nthe ore has been laid out in masses on the patio, the operations\r\nnecessary to produce the chemical changes commence. The first ingredient\r\nintroduced is salt, in the proportion of fifty pounds to every ton of\r\nore, and a number of mules are made to tread it, so that it may be\r\ndissolved in the water and intimately blended with the mass. On the\r\nfollowing day another ingredient is introduced, called in Mexico\r\n_magistral_. It is common copper-pyrites, or sulphide of copper and\r\niron, pulverised and calcined, which converts it into a sulphate. About\r\ntwenty-five pounds of this magistral are added for every ton of ore in\r\nthe torta, and the mules are again put in, and tread the mass for\r\nseveral hours. Chemical action now commences, and new combinations\r\nbetween the decomposed mineral substances are in progress. Quicksilver\r\nis then introduced, being spread over the torta in very small particles,\r\nwhich is effected by passing it through a coarse cloth. The quantity\r\nrequired is six times the estimated weight of the silver contained in\r\nthe ore.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GRINDING MILL.]\r\n\r\nThe quicksilver being spread over the surface, the mules are once more\r\nput in, and tread the whole until it is well mixed. Great skill is now\r\nrequired to watch the progress of the amalgamation, and to decide\r\nwhether any one of the ingredients that have been added to the ore is in\r\ndeficiency or excess.\r\n\r\nThe amalgamating process being at length ended, the mass is washed in\r\nlarge vats, through which streams of water are made to pass, so as to\r\ndrive away the lighter particles of the mud and to leave the heavy\r\namalgam at the bottom of the tub. After being strained through the\r\nstrong canvas bottom of a leathern bag, in order to separate the\r\nsuperfluous mercury, the amalgam is finally heated in large retorts,\r\nwhen the quicksilver is volatilised and the pure silver remains behind.\r\nAs a considerable quantity of mercury is thus lost, this metal has\r\nalways had a great influence on the working of the Mexican mines. When,\r\nin times of war, the importation of quicksilver from Europe was stopped,\r\nthus causing a considerable increase in its price, the ores accumulated\r\nin the magazines, as their poverty made it impossible to meet the\r\nadditional expense; and then it not unfrequently happened that\r\nproprietors, possessing ores to the amount of several millions of\r\ndollars, were unable to pay their current expenses. In the last century,\r\nthe Mexican mines annually required sixteen thousand hundredweight of\r\nmercury, which was furnished chiefly by the mines of Almaden,\r\nHuancavelica, and Idria. The sale of mercury to the various mining\r\nproprietors was a Government monopoly.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of silver produced by the Mexican mines in 110 years,\r\nending with the first year of the present century, amounted to about\r\nninety-eight millions of pounds troy, and the total value of the gold\r\nand silver produced from 1689 to 1803 to about 285 millions of pounds\r\nsterling.\r\n\r\nThe production was most abundant in the years 1805, 1806, and 1809, when\r\nit reached the sum of twenty-six and twenty-seven millions of dollars.\r\nIt then fell enormously during the revolutionary wars; but the English\r\nmining mania of 1824 having furnished the necessary capital for the re-\r\nopening of a large number of mines, it again gradually rose, and even\r\nreached during some years the rate of its most flourishing period. But\r\nit never amounted to one-third of the value which is now annually\r\nextracted from our coal mines; and while the latter open new and\r\nunbounded sources of wealth by the activity they communicate to\r\nnumberless branches of industry, Mexico—a prey to bigotry, ignorance,\r\nanarchy, and sloth—remains, in spite of her silver mines, as poor and as\r\nbarbarous as ever.\r\n\r\nIn South America, the mines of Potosi, Cerro di Pasco, and Gualgayoc,\r\nare the most renowned for their richness. In 1545, an Indian, while\r\npursuing some deer along the declivity of a steep mountain, took hold of\r\na shrub, the roots of which, giving way, brought to view a mass of\r\nsilver, the first discovery of the riches which have rendered Potosi the\r\nproverbial symbol of wealth. The Indian, wisely concealing his good\r\nfortune, repeatedly visited the mine, but his improved circumstances\r\nhaving been remarked by one of his countrymen, he was obliged to take\r\nhim into the secret. Unfortunately a quarrel ensued, and the faithless\r\nconfidant betrayed it to his master, Don José Villaroel, a Spaniard,\r\nwhose extraordinary success in working the mines soon drew the attention\r\nof all America to the wild Cerro di Potosi. A town of 100,000\r\ninhabitants soon rose in the desert, in spite of the wintry inclemency\r\nof the climate (12,842 feet above the level of the sea) and of the\r\nfabulous prices of provisions, as all the necessaries of life had to be\r\nconveyed from a vast distance over the pathless mountains.\r\n\r\nBut if living in Potosi was extravagantly dear, Mammon took care to\r\nprovide his votaries with the necessary means; for the treasures which\r\nwere here extracted from the bosom of the earth seem rather to belong to\r\nthe world of Oriental romance than to that of sober reality. According\r\nto Humboldt, the mountain of Potosi, whose topmost mine is situated\r\n15,384 feet above the level of the sea—considerably higher than the\r\neternal snows of the summit of Mont Blanc—produced from 1545 to 1803 no\r\nless than 230,000,000l., besides the silver which was not registered, or\r\nhad been carried off by fraud, and which may probably have amounted to\r\nas much again. During the period of their greatest prosperity—from 1585\r\nto 1606—when they annually yielded 882,000 marks of silver, 15,000\r\nIndians were occupied in the mines of Potosi. At present, however, their\r\nproduce, though still considerable, has diminished to one-eighth, and\r\nthe population of the town has shrunk in the same proportion.\r\n\r\nThe ores were at first reduced in a very imperfect manner, according to\r\nthe old Indian method. On the mountains surrounding the town of Potosi,\r\nwherever the wind blew with sufficient force, portable smelting ovens of\r\nclay, in which numerous holes kept up a strong current of air, received\r\nalternate layers of ore and charcoal, and the lively blast soon\r\nseparated the metal from the dross. The first travellers in the\r\nCordillera describe with enthusiasm the magnificent aspect of more than\r\n6,000 fires, which every evening blazed on the mountain crests of\r\nPotosi. Amalgamation was first introduced about the year 1571.\r\n\r\nOn the bleak Puna, or high table-land between the parallel chains of the\r\nCordillera and the Andes, is situated the famous mining town of Pasco.\r\nSurrounded by a crescent of steep and naked rocks, its straggling\r\nbuildings extend over an uneven ground, bordered by small marshes and\r\nlagunes. The shivering traveller, descending from the windy heights, is\r\nat first agreeably surprised by the sight of a large town in the midst\r\nof these dreary solitudes; but a nearer inspection of its narrow crooked\r\nstreets, and of its miserable huts, with here and there a stately\r\nmansion, soon dissipates the fancies he may have formed at a distance.\r\n\r\nThe wild, forbidding aspect of the neighbourhood, and the rigorous\r\nclimate, only a short day’s journey from the loveliest valleys, prove\r\nthe greatness of the subterranean treasures which could induce so large\r\na population to settle in so harsh a region.\r\n\r\nThe mines of Pasco, like those of Potosi, were discovered, it is said,\r\nby an Indian shepherd, who, accidentally lighting a fire where the ores\r\ncropped out, found silver among the ashes. There are two chief lodes,\r\nwith numerous branches, so that the whole neighbourhood may be\r\nconsidered as resting on a subterranean network of silver. The entrances\r\nto most of the mines are situated in the town itself; and, as every\r\nproprietor thinks only of his present profits, they are worked in so\r\nslovenly a manner that they frequently fall in. Tschudi, who visited\r\nsome of the deepest of them, always thought himself extremely fortunate\r\nwhen, after descending on half-rotten steps or by mouldering ropes and\r\nrusty chains, he returned again to daylight without accident, and\r\nmentions an instance where three hundred workmen were buried in the\r\nruins of a mine, in which the necessary props had been shamefully\r\nneglected.\r\n\r\nWhen a mine is very productive, it is said to be in ‘boya;’ and when\r\nsuch periods of affluence take place in several of the mines at once,\r\nthe population of Pasco sometimes increases to double or treble the\r\nusual number. The Peruvian miners are no less dishonest than their\r\nfellow-workmen in Mexico, and equally cunning in robbing their\r\nemployers. On the other hand their patience and perseverance are\r\nunrivalled. Satisfied with the coarsest food, and with a still more\r\nmiserable hut, they undergo an amount of bodily toil which no European\r\ncould endure. Their only solace is the chewing of Coca, the mysterious\r\nplant to which they ascribe such wonderfully stimulating powers, and\r\nwhich has at length begun to awaken the curiosity of European chemists\r\nand naturalists.[46] When a ‘boya’ raises their earnings to a\r\nconsiderable sum, they spend it in drunkenness, and never think of\r\nreturning to their work until their last farthing or their last credit\r\nis exhausted. The mineros, or proprietors of the mines, are almost\r\nequally uncivilised. Passionately devoted to gambling and mining\r\nspeculations, they are commonly deeply in debt to the capitalists of\r\nLima, who advance them money at the rate of 100 and 120 per cent.; and\r\nwhen a ‘boya’ favours them, this sudden increase of wealth is merely the\r\nprelude of new embarrassment.\r\n\r\nFootnote 46:\r\n\r\n  The seventeenth chapter of ‘The Tropical World’ is devoted to the\r\n  Erythroxylon Coca.\r\n\r\nAccording to law, all the produce of the silver mines should be sent to\r\nthe Callana or Government smelting-house; but in order to avoid the\r\nheavy duties levied by the State, vast quantities are smuggled to the\r\ncoast. The annual produce registered at the Callana amounts to about\r\n300,000 marks, but perhaps as much again is exported in a clandestine\r\nmanner. Besides the mines of Pasco, Peru possesses many others of\r\nconsiderable value, situated chiefly in the provinces of Pataz,\r\nHuamanchuco, Caxamarca, and Gualgayoc.\r\n\r\nThe famous Cerro de San Fernando de Gualgayoc, fourteen leagues from the\r\ntown of Caxamarca, is an isolated mountain traversed by numberless veins\r\nof silver. Its summit is sharply serrated by a multitude of tower-like\r\nor pyramidal pinnacles, and its steep sides are not only pierced by\r\nseveral hundred galleries for the extraction of the ores, but also by\r\nmany natural openings or caverns, through which the dark blue sky is\r\nvisible to the spectator standing at the foot of the mountain. The\r\nsingularity of aspect is increased by the numberless huts, sticking like\r\nnests to the slopes of the fortress-like mountain wherever a ledge\r\nallowed them to be constructed. During the first thirty years after the\r\ndiscovery of the mines from 1771 to 1802, they yielded considerably more\r\nthan thirty-two millions of dollars, and are still very productive.\r\n\r\nOne of the most celebrated silver mines of Peru was that of Salcedo,\r\nrenowned alike for its richness and for the tragical end of its\r\npossessor. Don José Salcedo, a poor Spaniard who had settled in Puno,\r\nfell in love with an Indian girl, whose mother, on condition of his\r\nmarrying her daughter, revealed to him the existence of a rich silver\r\nlode. The fame of Salcedo’s wealth spread far and wide, and excited the\r\nenvy of Count Lemos, the viceroy, who sought to obtain possession of the\r\nmine. As the good-natured and liberal Salcedo had become very popular\r\namong the Indians, this circumstance was made use of by the rapacious\r\nviceroy to accuse him of fomenting among the natives a spirit of\r\nrebellion against the Spanish yoke. He was cast into a dungeon, and the\r\nobsequious judges condemned him to death.\r\n\r\nWhile in prison Salcedo begged the viceroy to submit the case to the\r\nhigh court of justice at Madrid, and to allow him to appeal to the mercy\r\nof the king. At the same time he offered, as an acknowledgment for this\r\nfavour, to give the viceroy daily a bar of silver, from the day the ship\r\nleft the port of Callao to its return from Europe. If we consider that\r\nin those times a journey from Peru to Spain and back required at least\r\nfrom twelve to sixteen months, we may form some idea of Salcedo’s\r\nwealth. The viceroy, however, would not listen to the proposal, the very\r\nbrilliancy of which probably inflamed still more his cupidity, and he\r\nordered Salcedo to be hung. But his cruelty met with the disappointment\r\nit deserved; for when it became known that nothing could save Salcedo,\r\nhis Indian friends destroyed the works of the mine, and so carefully\r\nconcealed the entrance that it has remained undiscovered to the present\r\nday. After performing this work of retribution, the Indians dispersed,\r\nand neither promises nor tortures could wring the secret from those that\r\nwere caught.\r\n\r\nThough the mines of Peru have yielded and still yield vast quantities of\r\nsilver, yet probably only a few of the richest lodes are worked; for the\r\nIndians, to whom other lodes are well known, will never reveal their\r\nexistence to the white men. They know by experience how small a benefit\r\nthey derive from the mines, which are to them but a source of severe\r\nlabour. Thus they prefer leaving the treasures of the earth undisturbed,\r\nor use them only in cases of extreme necessity. In many provinces\r\nundoubted proofs exist that the richest silver mines are secretly worked\r\nby the Indians, but all efforts to discover them have proved fruitless.\r\n\r\nA Franciscan monk at Huancayo, a desperate gambler and almost always in\r\nwant of money, had by his friendly manners gained the goodwill of the\r\nIndians. One day, after a severe loss, he bitterly complained of his\r\ndistress to one of his Indian friends. After some hesitation the man\r\npromised to assist him, and brought him on the following evening a bag\r\nfull of rich silver ores. This gift he repeated several times. But the\r\nmonk, greedy after more, begged the Indian to show him the mine—a\r\nrequest which, after repeated refusals, was at length reluctantly\r\ngranted. On the appointed night, the Indian, with two of his comrades,\r\ncame to the Franciscan’s dwelling, took him on his shoulders, after\r\nfirst carefully blindfolding him, and carried him, alternately with his\r\nfriends, a distance of several leagues into the mountains. Here they\r\nhalted, and the Franciscan’s bandage having been removed, he found\r\nhimself in a subterranean gallery, where the richest silver ores\r\nsparkled from the walls. After feasting on the grateful sight and\r\nfilling his pockets, he was carried back again in the same way. On his\r\nreturn he secretly loosened the string of his rosary, and let a bead\r\ndrop from time to time, hoping by this means to be able to find the\r\nmine. But, on the following morning, as he was about to reconnoitre, his\r\nIndian friend knocked at the door, and saying, ‘Father, thou hast lost\r\nthy rosary!’ brought him a whole handful of the loose beads.\r\n\r\nIn 1850 the mines in the province of Copiapo in Chili yielded 335,000\r\nmarks of silver, nearly as much as the entire production of Europe, and\r\nthe State of Nevada in North America bids fair to rival the riches of\r\nPeru. The ores are found on the eastern slopes of the Sierra Nevada, in\r\nthe region of the Carson River, and have since 1859 attracted a stream\r\nof emigrants to the Washoe Mine. At the present time they annually\r\nproduce about 16,000,000 dollars of silver, chiefly from the Comstock\r\nLode, which may be ranked among the richest mineral deposits ever\r\nencountered in the history of mining enterprise.\r\n\r\nThus we find veins and deposits of silver ore scattered throughout\r\nalmost the entire length of America; and no doubt many an unknown Potosi\r\nstill lies concealed in the lonely ravines or on the bleak sides of the\r\nAndes, awaiting but some fortunate discoverer to astonish the world with\r\nits treasures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXVI.\r\n                                COPPER.\r\n\r\nIts valuable Qualities—English Copper Mines—Their comparatively recent\r\n  Importance—Dreary Aspect of the Cornwall Copper Country—Botallack—\r\n  Submarine Copper Mines—A Blind Miner—Swansea—Smelting Process—The\r\n  Mines of Fahlun—Their Ancient Records—Alten Fjord—Drontheim—The Mines\r\n  of Rivaas—The Mines of Mansfeldt—Lake Superior—Mysterious Discoveries—\r\n  Burra Burra—Remarkable Instances of Good Fortune in Copper Mining.\r\n\r\n\r\nCopper derives its name from the island of Cyprus, where it was\r\nextensively mined and smelted by the Greeks; but its first discovery is\r\nof much more ancient date, and loses itself in the darkness of the\r\nprehistoric ages. Weapons and tools of bronze—its alloy with tin—have\r\nbeen found both in the tumuli of extinct nations and in the lacustrine\r\ndwellings of the Swiss lakes, erected by an unknown people in unknown\r\ntimes. Among the Egyptians, the Greeks, and Etrurians, copper was in\r\nimmemorial use, and the ancient Celtic nations fought their battles with\r\ncopper or brazen swords, and felled the trees for the construction of\r\ntheir rude hovels with axes of the same metal.\r\n\r\nAs in many parts of the world native copper is found scattered over the\r\nsurface of the earth in large lumps or masses, it naturally attracted\r\nthe attention of barbarous tribes much sooner than iron, which very\r\nrarely occurs in the native state; and some fortunate chance or lucky\r\nexperiment having shown that, when rendered malleable by heat, it could\r\neasily be hammered into any convenient shape, it soon became, and has\r\never since remained, one of the most valuable metals. Forming important\r\ncompounds with tin (bronze) and zinc (brass), remarkably incorrodible as\r\ncompared with iron, and nearly as tenacious in structure, but not so\r\nhard, it is recommended by its qualities for a variety of uses, and its\r\nconsumption everywhere increases with the progress of civilization and\r\nthe extension of commerce. Fortunately copper is of such common\r\noccurrence that a mere enumeration of the localities where it is found\r\nwould swell into a long and tedious list; it is enough to state that\r\nrich copper mines exist both in the Old World and the New, and promise\r\nan inexhaustible supply to the most distant generations.\r\n\r\nIn Europe England is the chief copper-producing country. Rich mines have\r\nbeen discovered and worked in Anglesey, Shropshire, Cheshire, and\r\nStaffordshire, in the counties of Wicklow, Cork, and Waterford; but by\r\nfar the largest quantity is supplied by Cornwall and Devon.\r\n\r\n‘The history of Cornish copper,’ says Mr. Warner, ‘is as a mushroom of\r\nlast night compared with that of tin. Lying deep below the surface of\r\nthe earth, it would be concealed from the inquiries of human industry\r\ntill such time as natural philosophy had made considerable progress, and\r\nthe mechanical arts had reached their present state of perfection; for\r\nnotwithstanding tin in Cornwall seldom runs deeper than fifty fathoms\r\nbelow the surface, good copper is seldom found at a less depth than\r\nthat. Accordingly we do not find that any regular researches were made\r\nfor copper ores in Cornwall till the latter end of the fifteenth\r\ncentury, when a few adventurers worked in an imperfect manner some\r\ninsignificant mines. Half a century afterwards, in the reign of\r\nElizabeth, though the product of the mines would naturally be greater\r\nthan before, yet little advantage seems to have been derived to the\r\ncountry at large from the working of its copper. Writers hint at the\r\nmystery made of its uses by the merchants. In the next reign, however,\r\nall mystery was dispersed, the mines were inspected, their value\r\ndetermined, and a system was introduced of working them to greater\r\nadvantage.’\r\n\r\nYet so wretched was the knowledge of mineralogy before 1712 that the\r\nyellow copper ore, at present so highly valued, was considered of no\r\nimportance and cast aside as worthless rubbish. Since the reign of\r\nGeorge I. there has been so much improvement that, next to iron and\r\ncoal, copper is now the most important of our mineral products.\r\n\r\nThe chief Cornish copper mines are situated in the districts of\r\nCamborne, Redruth, and Gwennap, which are about the dreariest of all\r\nBritish wildernesses. Few trees are to be seen, few fields; furze and\r\nwild berries form the chief vegetation of the niggard soil. Blocks upon\r\nblocks of stone are scattered over these desolate moorlands, that have\r\nbeen excavated, dug into hillocks, disturbed and turned over and over\r\nagain, sometimes by the primeval stream-works of the _old men_ or\r\nancient miners, sometimes by more modern labour in search of metallic\r\nwealth. Off the roads these districts are utterly impervious on wheels\r\nor on horseback, and the traveller can only walk, or rather flounder,\r\nover them by jumping from patch to patch of firmer land. Yet this scene\r\nof apparent poverty is in reality one of the very richest portions of\r\nthe kingdom, and conceals more wealth beneath its sterile surface than\r\nhas ever been produced by a similar extent of the fairest fields and\r\npastures.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE BOTALLACK MINE, CORNWALL.]\r\n\r\nThe bluff promontory of Botallack, not far from Cape Cornwall, conceals\r\nin its rocky entrails a copper mine, the most singularly placed,\r\nprobably, of any mine in the world, for nowhere do the triumphs of\r\nindustry appear in more picturesque connection with the magnificent\r\nscenery of the ocean. The metalliferous veins running along the cliffs\r\ninto the sea vainly concealed themselves beneath the swelling surge; in\r\nvain a huge barrier of rocks seemed to render them inaccessible to the\r\nminer, as soon as it became known that here, buried under the ocean, lay\r\ntreasures that would amply repay the cost and labour expended, and the\r\ndanger encountered in seeking for them.\r\n\r\nTo those who stand below the cliff and look up from the sea, the view is\r\nfearfully grand, and remarkable for the combination of the wonders of\r\nart with the wonders of nature. The separate parts of an enormous steam-\r\nengine had to be lowered 200 feet down the almost perpendicular\r\nprecipice, and a tram-road runs right up the face of the cliff. Lofty\r\nchimneys, pouring out dense volumes of black smoke, are seen perched on\r\nthe verge and even on the ledges of a tremendous precipice, and the\r\nminer has built his hut over the sea-bird’s roost. All these\r\nconstructions seem at the mercy of every storm, and to the beholder from\r\nbeneath they almost appear suspended in the air and tottering to their\r\nfall.\r\n\r\nOn one side of the cliff tall ladders scale the rock; but he must have\r\nstrong nerves who can tread them fearlessly, the sea roaring under him\r\nand flinging its raging spray after him as he ascends, while in other\r\nparts mules and their riders may be seen trotting up and down the rocky\r\ntracks which the pedestrian visitor would scarcely dare to pass. A\r\nstrange and restless life pervades a scene which nature seemed to have\r\nfor ever removed far from the busy haunts of man.\r\n\r\nA visit to this remarkable mine leaves an ineradicable impression on the\r\nmind. Descending ladder after ladder, and passing on from gallery to\r\ngallery, stepping over rough stones and awkward holes, now stooping down\r\nunder masses of overhanging rock, and now climbing over stony\r\nprojections beneath your feet, you are at length informed that you are\r\nvertically 120 feet below the sea-level, and horizontally 480 feet under\r\nthe bottom of the ocean or beyond low-water mark, while still deeper\r\ndown human beings are hewing the hard rock. The brine oozes through the\r\nmetallic ceiling, and the sound of distant waters falls faintly upon the\r\near.\r\n\r\nThere are other submarine mines in the neighbourhood of Botallack. In\r\nLittle Bounds and Wheal Cock the hardihood of the miners tempted them to\r\nfollow the ore upwards, even to the sea; but the openings made were very\r\nsmall, and, the rock being extremely hard, a covering of wood and cement\r\nin the former, and a small plug in the latter mine, sufficed to exclude\r\nthe water, and protected the workmen from the fatal consequences of\r\ntheir rashness. ‘In all these, and in Wheal Edward and Levant,’ says Mr.\r\nHenwood,[47] ‘I have heard the dashing of the billows and the grating of\r\nthe shingle overhead even in calm weather. I was once, however,\r\nunderground in Wheal Cock during a storm. At the extremity of the\r\n_level_ seaward, some eighty or one hundred fathoms from the shore,\r\nlittle could be heard of its effects, except at intervals, when the\r\nreflux of some unusually large wave projected a pebble outward, bounding\r\nand rolling over the rocky bottom. But when standing beneath the base of\r\nthe cliff, and in that part of the mine where but nine feet of the rock\r\nstood between us and the ocean, the heavy roll of the large boulders,\r\nthe ceaseless grinding of the pebbles, the fierce thundering of the\r\nbillows, with the crackling and boiling as they rebounded, placed a\r\ntempest in its most appalling form too vividly before me ever to be\r\nforgotten. More than once, doubting the protection of our working\r\nshield, we retreated in affright, and it was only after repeated trials\r\nthat we had confidence to pursue our investigations.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 47:\r\n\r\n  ‘Transactions of the Royal Geological Society of Cornwall,’ vol. v. p.\r\n  11.\r\n\r\nIt seems that at times of great storms, even the miners, accustomed for\r\nyears to these submarine caverns, have been terrified by the roaring of\r\nthe sea. They have heard, as it were, mountain dashing against mountain,\r\nor as if all the artillery of England was booming over their heads. Yet\r\ntheir roof of rock, thin as it is in some parts, has hitherto shielded\r\nthem against the sea, and will no doubt continue to defend them against\r\nit. On leaving these wonderful submarine excavations, the scenery of the\r\nupper world appears doubly beautiful.\r\n\r\nThe ‘Traveller Underground’[48] tells us a remarkable story of a blind\r\nman who once worked in Botallack, and continued his perilous toils\r\nunderground for a long period, from the dread of being compelled to\r\naccept parish relief. By the fruits of his labour he supported a family\r\nof nine children, and such was his marvellous recollection of every\r\nturning and winding of the mine that he became a guide to his fellow-\r\nlabourers if by any accident their lights were extinguished. On being\r\ndischarged from this employment (and they must truly have had rocky\r\nhearts who did discharge him), this poor blind man soon afterwards met\r\nhis death in a melancholy manner. Being engaged as attendant on some\r\nbrick-layers, who were building a house at St. Ives, he had to carry the\r\nhods of mortar up to the scaffolding. Stepping too far back from a\r\nplatform, he fell, and died almost immediately.\r\n\r\nFootnote 48:\r\n\r\n  ‘Cornwall, its Mines and Miners.’ London, 1860.\r\n\r\nThe chief copper ores of Cornwall are the bisulphuret (containing nearly\r\nequal parts of copper, sulphur, and iron), the sulphuret, or grey ore of\r\nthe miners (containing more than 79 per cent. of copper), and the black\r\nore, an almost pure oxide; but when extracted from the mine, these ores\r\nare generally so mixed up with impurities that their average contents do\r\nnot amount to more than 2½ or 3½ per cent. They have consequently to\r\nundergo various processes of picking, crushing, sorting, and washing,\r\nbefore they are rendered saleable and fit for export to the smelting\r\nworks of Swansea, the grand emporium for copper. The reason why they are\r\nnot smelted on the spot is that the fuel needed is more bulky than the\r\nore, and it is cheaper to bring the copper of Cornwall to the coal of\r\nSouth Wales than to take the coal to the copper. In Swansea—but half a\r\ncentury ago a mere hamlet, and now a flourishing town of 36,000\r\ninhabitants—we find all the conditions needed for the development of a\r\nvast industry. Coal and water-power in inexhaustible abundance,\r\nexcellent roads and railroads, the nearness of the sea, canals which\r\nallow vessels of considerable burden to load and unload close to the\r\nsmelting huts, so that their high masts rise alongside of the towering\r\nchimneys—these are the natural and artificial advantages to which\r\nSwansea owes its rank as the first copper manufacturing town in the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nFor, not satisfied with the abundant ores of Great Britain, its smelting\r\nworks seek their materials in almost every copper-producing country of\r\nthe globe. The rich ores of Chili and Australia, of Cuba and North\r\nAmerica, of Norway and Tuscany, all find their way to Swansea, which re-\r\nexports the metal to every part of the world.\r\n\r\nVivian’s works, the most important of the establishments of Swansea, are\r\nsituated in a vale a couple of miles from the town. A maritime canal\r\nenables brigs to sail at high tide up to the smelting furnaces, whence a\r\nsecond canal leads to the coal-pits, ascending the hill by a succession\r\nof locks. Although in the building of this huge factory not a thought\r\nwas given to grace or beauty of form, utility being the sole aim in\r\nview, still its vast extent leaves on the mind a certain impression of\r\ngrandeur.\r\n\r\nThe whole smelting process is carried on in reverberatory furnaces.[49]\r\nIn order to disengage the sulphur and other volatile impurities, the ore\r\nis first roasted in at least sixteen of these powerful ovens, each of\r\nwhich holds forty hundredweight, and performs its office in six hours.\r\nThe smoke of all these furnaces collects in a huge chimney, which, after\r\nclimbing the hill for about six hundred feet, ends in a mighty column\r\ntwo hundred feet high. The roasted ores are then mixed with a certain\r\nproportion of fluor spar, and smelted in twenty smaller reverberatory\r\nfurnaces. A ton is introduced at a time, and in each oven seven tons can\r\nbe smelted in twenty-four hours. It would lead me too far were I to\r\nenter into more minute details. I will therefore briefly state that the\r\ncopper is still obliged to pass four times through differently\r\nconstructed furnaces before it is sufficiently pure to be rolled into\r\nsheets or to be granulated, a condition in which it is used for the\r\nfabrication of brass, as it then presents more surface to the action of\r\nthe zinc, and combines with it more readily. To produce this\r\ngranulation, the metal is poured into a large ladle pierced with holes,\r\nand placed above a cistern filled with water, which must be hot or cold\r\naccording to the form of the grains required. When it is hot, round\r\ngrains are obtained, analogous to lead shot, and the copper in this\r\nstate is called _bean shot_. When the melted copper falls into cold\r\nwater perpetually renewed, the granulations are irregular, thin, and\r\nramified, constituting _feathered_ shot.\r\n\r\nFootnote 49:\r\n\r\n  A reverberatory furnace is a furnace in which intense heat is produced\r\n  by a flame which, while passing through a furnace, _reverberates_ from\r\n  the roof over the substance to be fused, the draught being created by\r\n  means of a lofty chimney.\r\n\r\nThe process of preparing the copper does not present the bustle and\r\nactivity nor the glare and brilliancy of an ironwork. The smoke and\r\nvapour disengaged from the ore are of the most noxious and disagreeable\r\nkind, and impart to the whole neighbourhood a singularly gloomy\r\ncharacter. The stunted vegetation is so kept down by it that there are\r\nno trees, and, instead of grass, a dry, yellow, sickly growth of\r\nchamomile barely covers the ground. When viewed from a neighbouring\r\neminence at night, the livid glare from the chimneys, the rolling white\r\nclouds of smoke which fill up the valley beneath, the desolate-looking\r\nheaps of slag, and the pungent sulphurous vapours remind the spectator\r\nof\r\n\r\n               ‘The dismal situation, waste and wild,\r\n               The dungeon horrible on all sides round,’\r\n\r\nwhere Satan lay weltering after his fall from heaven.\r\n\r\nAfter England, Sweden, Germany, and Russia take the lead among the\r\ncopper-producing countries of Europe.\r\n\r\nThe mines of Fahlun in Dalecarlia are no less remarkable for their\r\npicturesque appearance than the celebrated iron mines of Dannemora in\r\nthe same province. A vast pit, 1,200 feet long, 600 feet broad, and\r\nabove 180 feet deep, with precipitous, sometimes vertical, and\r\noccasionally even overhanging walls, opens before the spectator, who\r\nmight fancy himself standing on the brink of an enormous crater. ‘The\r\naspect of this deep chasm,’ says Professor Haussmann,[50] ‘affords a\r\ndesolate picture of ruin caused by improvidence and waste, as it owes\r\nits origin to the successive fallings in of subterranean excavations\r\ncarelessly widened and left without sufficient supports. From the vast\r\nmounds of rubbish accumulated at the bottom of the pit, remnants of\r\nancient shafts, formed of thick beams of wood, are seen protruding, but\r\nthese show only a part of the devastation produced by the great falling\r\nin which took place in the year 1678. On the northern side of the pit is\r\na broad and convenient wooden staircase, by which not only the miners,\r\nbut also the horses used for working the subterranean machinery, descend\r\nto the bottom. Thence it gradually winds underground to a depth of 177\r\nfathoms.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 50:\r\n\r\n  ‘Geological Travels through Sweden.’\r\n\r\nAs is generally the case in Sweden, the ore of Fahlun forms considerable\r\nmasses, the chief being a vast reniform lump 1,200 feet long and 600\r\nbroad at its upper surface, and gradually narrowing as it descends. Near\r\nthis gigantic _stock_ are situated similar deposits, which though of\r\nsmaller dimensions are still very considerable. From the copper pyrites\r\nbeing deposited chiefly on the circumference or the outer shell of these\r\nreniform masses, which are themselves of extremely irregular outline,\r\nthe mining operations are carried on with great difficulty, and exhibit\r\na perfect labyrinth of crooked and winding galleries, situated at\r\nvarious depths, and supported by pillars or sometimes by walls—a\r\npeculiarity which explains the successive fallings in that have formed\r\nthe enormous pit of Fahlun. The mine has been worked from time\r\nimmemorial, and is said to have been known even before the Christian\r\nera. The oldest document extant bears the date of the year 1347, and\r\ncontains the privileges granted to the proprietors of the mine by King\r\nOlaus Smek; but still more ancient documents are mentioned, among others\r\na purchase-deed of the year 1200. As the ores are poor, their abundance\r\nalone renders the working of the mine profitable; but Fahlun has seen\r\nits best days and is doomed to a gradual decline. During its greatest\r\nprosperity it is said to have yielded 5,000 tons of copper annually, but\r\nin 1866 it furnished no more that 600 tons, or about one-third of the\r\nentire production of Sweden.\r\n\r\nIn 1719 a body, preserved from corruption by the vitriolic water with\r\nwhich it had been saturated, was found in an abandoned part of the\r\nFahlun mines. When it had been brought up to the surface, the whole\r\nneighbourhood flocked together to see it; but nobody could recognise a\r\nlost friend or kinsman in its young and handsome features. At length an\r\nold woman, more than 80 years of age, approached with tottering steps,\r\nand casting a glance on the corpse, uttered a piercing shriek and fell\r\nsenseless on the ground. She had instantly recognised her affianced\r\nlover, who had mysteriously disappeared more than sixty years\r\npreviously, but whose image she still bore in her faithful memory. As he\r\nwas not employed in the mines, no search had been made for him\r\nunderground at the time. Most probably he had fallen, by some accident,\r\ninto one of the numerous crevices by which the surface of the mines is\r\ntraversed. Thus the tottering woman, weighed down with the double burden\r\nof infirmity and age, saw once more the face of her lover as she had\r\nlooked upon it in the days of her youth.\r\n\r\nIn the sister kingdom of Norway, which produces annually about 480 tons\r\nof copper, the mines of the Alten Fjord are remarkable for their high\r\nnorthern situation (in 70° N. Lat., beyond the Arctic Circle). A piece\r\nof copper ore found by a Lap woman in 1825 fell accidentally into the\r\nhands of Mr. Crowe, an English merchant in Hammerfest, who immediately\r\ntook measures for obtaining a privilege from Government for the working\r\nof a mine. All preliminaries being arranged, he set off for London,\r\nwhere he founded a company with a capital of 75,000_l._ When Marmier\r\nvisited the Alten Fjord in 1842, more than 1,100 workmen were employed\r\nin these most northerly mining works of the world; but probably the\r\nnumber has since decreased.\r\n\r\nAlthough Drontheim or Tronyem is renowned in Norse history as the seat\r\nof many kings, yet the town seems as if built but yesterday. Repeated\r\nconflagrations have often reduced its wooden houses to ashes. The choir\r\nof the ancient cathedral, the finest edifice ever built in so high a\r\nlatitude, is the only remaining memorial of old Tronyem; but the modern\r\ncity is remarkably clean and well built, and gives evidence, by its\r\noutward appearance, of the prosperity of its citizens, which is partly\r\nowing to the fish-trade and partly to the neighbouring copper-mines of\r\nRöraas. The tall chimneys of the smelting huts and other manufactories\r\nfounded on the mineral riches of the country show that the spirit of\r\ntrade is perfectly awake in the old capital of Saint Olaus, and that the\r\nabode of the ancient sea-kings is none the worse for having abandoned\r\npiracy for the more homely pursuits of modern commerce. The copper ores,\r\nwhich were first discovered in 1644, occur in the Röraas Mountains in\r\nextensive veins. The entrance, which resembles the mouth of a cave and\r\nleads into the mine by a gradual descent, is so broad that carts laden\r\nwith ore and drawn by horses can freely pass in and out. When Professor\r\nHaussmann, of Göttingen, visited the mine, long stalactites of ice hung\r\nfrom the roof of the entrance and covered its rugged walls with crystal\r\ndrapery. The lights of the numerous workmen who opened the march made\r\nthe ice glitter with all the colours of the rainbow, and then, as they\r\nwent onward, illuminated the broad galleries, propped by mighty pillars,\r\nand branching into gloomy recesses. At length they halted, and all at\r\nonce, on a given signal, the brilliant illumination was changed into the\r\ndeepest darkness. A deathlike stillness now reigned in the vault, when\r\nsuddenly a flash of lightning blazed through the gloom, a loud clap of\r\nthunder instantly followed, and, with crash on crash, the explosions of\r\nmany charges of blasting powder shook the walls of the neighbouring\r\ngalleries. After the last shot was fired, the torches were relit, and\r\njoyously exchanging the usual salutation of German miners: ‘Glück\r\nauf!’[51] the company moved on. ‘I cannot find words,’ says the\r\nProfessor, in whose honour the impressive scene had been arranged, ‘to\r\nexpress the pleasure I felt at this cordial reception given me in the\r\nhigh north by men unknown to me a few days since. It confirmed the\r\nexperience I had already so often made before, that probably no\r\nprofession so soon produces a friendly and intimate connexion between\r\nstrangers as that of the miner.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 51:\r\n\r\n  ‘Good luck upwards!’ or ‘A happy return to daylight.’\r\n\r\nThe copper production of Germany is about equal in amount to that of the\r\nScandinavian kingdoms. The Rammelsberg,[B] near Goslar in the Hartz,\r\nwhich has been worked ever since the year 968, is probably the oldest\r\nmine in Europe. The famous copper mines of the county of Mansfeldt in\r\nPrussia afford a striking example of the success obtainable in mining\r\noperations by perseverance and a wise economy. The whole thickness of\r\nthe cupriferous bed of bituminous shale is no more than from eight to\r\nsixteen inches; but as the ore, though poor, contains a small quantity\r\nof silver, this circumstance, assisted by good management and the\r\napplication of science, has not only rendered it possible to work the\r\nmines for many centuries, but to render them so flourishing that in 1852\r\nthey produced 1,350 tons of copper and 31,800 marks of silver, leaving a\r\nnet profit of more than 20,000_l._ The hewers are obliged to perform\r\ntheir labour in galleries not more than twenty-two or twenty-eight\r\ninches high, the narrowest limits within which a man can possibly move\r\nand work. The boys who transport the ore slide or creep with a truly\r\nwonderful rapidity along the floor, dragging after them, by means of a\r\nsling attached to their foot, a waggon loaded with as much as five\r\nhundredweight of ore. The hewer’s wages for seven hours of this hard\r\nwork are no more than two shillings; yet the miners look very healthy\r\nand cheerful, a remarkable proof of the wonderful effects of habit.\r\n\r\nThe vast empire of Russia produces about 5,000 tons of copper annually,\r\nchiefly from the mines of the Ural, belonging to Prince Demidoff; but a\r\nlarge proportion is furnished by the Asiatic mines of the Altaï and of\r\nNertschinsk in Transbaikalia. New deposits have lately been discovered\r\nin the land of the Kirghise, near the Irtysch; and, as the ores are\r\nexceedingly rich, and coal is found near them, they will, no doubt,\r\nbecome valuable in time.\r\n\r\nDuring the last twenty years America has far exceeded Europe in the\r\nproduction of copper. The inexhaustible mines of Chili extend along the\r\nwhole coast of the republic, and are generally situated within a\r\nconvenient distance from the sea and near the best ports of the Pacific,\r\nsuch as Caldera, Coquimbo, and Valparaiso. Originally the ores were all\r\nsent to Europe to be smelted; but since 1865 the discovery of coal near\r\nvarious parts of the coast has encouraged the establishment of numerous\r\nsmelting furnaces, so that Chili now exports no less than from 40,000 to\r\n45,000 tons of metallic copper, besides furnishing large quantities of\r\nore to the smelting works of Swansea.\r\n\r\nAfter Chili no country has made such rapid strides in copper-mining as\r\nthe United States. The primeval forests of Northern Michigan and\r\nWisconsin would probably still be the undisputed domain of the Indian\r\nhunter if the mineral treasures of the soil had not been a prize too\r\nvaluable to escape the notice of our wealth-seeking age. Soon after the\r\nfirst settlement of the French in Canada some bold adventurers had\r\nindeed penetrated as far as the distant shores of Lake Superior, and\r\ngiven wonderful accounts of the large masses of copper which they had\r\nseen scattered over the country; but the want of all means of\r\ncommunication hindered for a long time the advance of the miner.\r\n\r\nThe Chippeways, who for centuries had occupied the banks of the lake,\r\nwhere, like all other Indian tribes, they spent their time in hunting\r\nand fishing, never thought of availing themselves of the mineral riches\r\nof their territory. They indeed picked up now and then some pieces of\r\ncopper, and sold them as curiosities to the fur-dealers with whom they\r\ntraded; but they were still far too uncivilized to seek in the\r\nneighbouring hills for deposits of the valuable metal. Their traditions\r\ngive no account of their first settlement in the country; they believed\r\nthemselves to be aboriginals. Thus, when at length the land came to be\r\ngeologically surveyed, the discovery of extensive prehistoric mining\r\nworks created no small astonishment. These relics of an unknown people,\r\nwhose existence and disappearance is one of the most interesting enigmas\r\nof ancient American history, are chiefly situated on the hill-crests of\r\nIsle Royale and in the Ontanagon district, where they may be traced for\r\nmiles. Trees, many hundred years old, now grow in the hollows\r\nlaboriously excavated by that extinct race in the hard rock with tools\r\nof stone or copper. Shafts, twenty or thirty feet deep, sunk in the\r\nhardest greenstone, have been discovered after felling the trees and\r\nremoving the rubbish which, in the course of time, had been accumulated\r\nin the cavities. In many the old tools were found which served to\r\nexcavate them—stone hammers of various sizes, or chisels of artificially\r\nhardened copper. On the hill behind the Minnesota Pit a mass of copper\r\nseveral tons in weight was found placed on wooden rollers, which proved\r\nthat those unknown miners must have possessed a considerable mechanical\r\nknowledge, without which it would have been impossible to remove such\r\nheavy masses. In some galleries copper blocks were discovered from which\r\npieces had been chiselled off, and the whole of the works gave proofs of\r\na skill and persevering industry quite foreign to the unsettled habits\r\nof the wild and indolent race of hunters which, as far as memory\r\nreached, had occupied these distant regions.\r\n\r\nAlthough the expeditions of General Cass in 1819 and of Major Long in\r\n1823 had drawn public attention to the copper of Lake Superior, still\r\ntwenty years more passed before they became the object of mining\r\nspeculations, which at once rose to a feverish height. Numerous\r\ncompanies were started in 1843, and mines were opened in many hundred\r\nplaces at once. The natural consequence of this copper mania was\r\ndisappointment in most cases, and in 1847 the greater number of the\r\nmines, which had been opened with the most extravagant expectations,\r\nwere abandoned. A few companies only withstood the crisis, and\r\nultimately proved so remarkably successful as fully to retrieve the lost\r\ncredit of the copper country, the annual yield of which at the present\r\ntime is about 10,000 tons, and consequently nearly equals that of\r\nCornwall.\r\n\r\nThe copper occurs in the native state in veins intersecting the trap and\r\nsandstone, but also in scattered superficial masses along the chain of\r\nhills which extends from the western to the north-eastern extremity of\r\nLake Superior. In no known locality have such large masses of copper\r\nbeen found. An enormous block was discovered in February 1857 in the\r\nMinnesota mine. It was forty-five feet in length, twenty-two feet at the\r\ngreatest width, and the thickest part was more than eight feet. It\r\ncontained over ninety per cent. of copper, and weighed about 420 tons. A\r\nstill more prodigious mass, sixty-five feet long, thirty-two feet broad,\r\nand four feet thick, was found in 1869. This king of copper nuggets\r\nweighed no less than 1,000 tons, and was worth 80,000_l._, or more than\r\nthe greatest lump of gold that ever came to light in Australia or\r\nCalifornia.\r\n\r\nRich copper mines have likewise been discovered in the States of\r\nMaryland, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, and New York, but chiefly in\r\nCalifornia, where since 1861 the small town of Copperopolis[52] has\r\nrisen into importance. More than 30,000 tons of Californian copper ores\r\n(chiefly sulphurets) are now annually exported to the smelting-houses of\r\nthe bay of Boston, which are likewise supplied by the ores of Chili and\r\nCanada, and form a new Swansea on the opposite shore of the Atlantic.\r\nThe whole annual production of the United States at present exceeds\r\n20,000 tons of metallic copper, mostly consumed in the country.\r\n\r\nFootnote 52:\r\n\r\n  This hybrid name, a vile compound of English and Greek, is enough to\r\n  excite the wrath of a philologist.\r\n\r\nThe mines of Cuba, which were very important, have latterly fallen off;\r\nbut in 1866 the exportation to Swansea still amounted to 11,254 tons of\r\nore.\r\n\r\nAmong the rich copper countries of the world I have finally to mention\r\nSouth Australia, New South Wales, and Victoria. The most extraordinary\r\ncopper mine of modern times for produce is that of Burra-Burra in South\r\nAustralia. It was started in September 1845, with a capital of\r\n12,000_l._, subscribed by a few merchants and traders of Adelaide, and\r\nin the following five years yielded no less than 56,428 tons of ore,\r\nworth 738,108_l._ The gold discoveries momentarily put a stop to its\r\nprosperity; but of late years the works have been resumed, and other\r\nrich mines have been opened, so that copper will long remain one of the\r\nstaple productions of Australia.\r\n\r\nThe history of some of our copper mines affords examples of good fortune\r\nno less remarkable than those which we find mentioned in the annals of\r\nthe Mexican silver-mining.\r\n\r\nTresavean Copper Mine, within a walk of Redruth, had once or twice been\r\nabandoned as a failure. At length it was taken up by parties who\r\npersevered in exploring it, and succeeded in discovering its wealth by\r\nan outlay of little more than 1,000_l._ From 1838 to 1843 the profits\r\naveraged 30,693_l._ per annum, and in 1833 630_l._ were divided per\r\nshare, or in all 60,480_l._ upon ninety-nine shares, each share having\r\nabout 20_l._ paid up, so that in one year the profits surpassed more\r\nthan thirty times the capital invested.\r\n\r\nOld Crinnis Copper Mine, near St. Austell, was in 1808 abandoned, after\r\nrepeated failures, and declared by the best miners of the day to be not\r\nworth ‘a pipe of tobacco.’ In 1809 Mr. Joshua Rowe, of Torpoint, and\r\nsome co-adventurers, notwithstanding the general contempt for the mine,\r\nbegan working it again. As it still remained poor, the adventurers\r\ndropped off one by one, leaving the entire cost of working upon Mr.\r\nRowe, who, after laying out a few additional hundreds, was rewarded by\r\nthe discovery of a rich mass of ore at about ten fathoms from the\r\nsurface. Upon this becoming known, the old adventurers again claimed\r\ntheir shares; but Mr. Rowe resisted their unjust pretentions and won his\r\nlawsuit. In the short space of four years and a half, this mine made a\r\nclear profit of 168,000_l._, besides paying 20,000_l._ for law expenses.\r\n\r\nAnother instance of remarkable success is afforded by the Devon Great\r\nConsols Mines, which were opened in the year 1844. The capital of the\r\ncompany which undertook their working was parted into 1,024 shares, with\r\n1_l._ paid on each share. In the same year by November a rich copper\r\nlode was cut, and the profits paid working expenses without call. The\r\nlodes soon began to turn out so rich that in the six years between the\r\ndates of 1844 and of 1850 the company extracted and sold copper ores to\r\nthe amount of 600,000_l._ After paying all expenses, the shareholders\r\nreceived about 207,000_l._, or more than 200_l._ per share on 1_l._\r\npaid. No more was called, and thus an average annual dividend of 35_l._,\r\nequivalent to 3,500 per cent., fell to the lot of each share.\r\n\r\nSuch instances, however, of good fortune are very rare, for mining in\r\nCornwall, as elsewhere, is much more frequently attended with\r\ndisappointment and loss. Sometimes an apparently rich produce is\r\nabsorbed by still greater expenses, or veins very promising when first\r\nopened fall off below, and occasion immense loss to the adventurers. A\r\nsudden fall in the price of the metal is alone sufficient to render many\r\nof the poorer mines perfectly worthless for a long time.[53] Hence\r\nnothing can be more hazardous than to invest capital in a mining\r\nconcern; and if Shakespeare had foreseen the delusions of modern\r\nspeculations in concerns of this kind, he could not more truly have\r\ncharacterised them than by saying—\r\n\r\n               ‘The earth hath bubbles as the water hath,\r\n               And these are of them.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 53:\r\n\r\n  Since the discovery of the rich North American and Chilian mines the\r\n  price of copper has fallen about 30 per cent. The consequence has been\r\n  a great diminution of our copper production. Thus Cornwall and\r\n  Devonshire, which in 1856 yielded 206,177 tons of copper ore, worth\r\n  1,241,835_l._, saw their produce gradually diminish from that time,\r\n  and in 1865 furnished no more than 159,409 tons, worth only\r\n  753,427_l._ In 1856 the mean average price of copper was 123_l._ per\r\n  ton; in 1865 it was no more than 94_l._ 7_s._\r\n\r\nYet the hope of suddenly getting rich, and the very risks and daring\r\nattending all mining undertakings, have an almost magical attraction;\r\nand, in spite of numberless instances of loss or ruin, there will\r\nprobably never be a want of speculators willing to embark their fortunes\r\non this unstable foundation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXVII.\r\n                                  TIN.\r\n\r\nTin known from the most remote antiquity—Phœnician Traders—The\r\n  Cassiterides—Diodorus Siculus—His Account of the Cornish Tin Trade—The\r\n  Age of Bronze—Valuable Qualities of Tin—Tin Countries—Cornish Tin\r\n  Lodes—Tin Streams—Wheal Vor—A Subterranean Blacksmith—Huel Wherry, a\r\n  Tin Mine under the Sea—Carclaze Tin Mine—Dressing of Tin Ores—\r\n  Smelting—The Cornish Miner.\r\n\r\n\r\nTin is one of the metals most anciently known to man. Its first\r\ndiscovery is hidden, like that of silver, gold, copper, and iron, in\r\ncomplete obscurity, for even the names of the nations which first made\r\nuse of it are not known. Axes and lances, sickles and fishhooks of\r\nbronze—the well-known alloy of copper and tin—occur among the ruins of\r\nthe ancient lacustrine habitations of Switzerland, and the tin of these\r\nbronze utensils could only be obtained by commerce from countries far\r\nremote, where it must, doubtless, have been known for many ages, before\r\nit found its way into the heart of Central Europe. Thus a few bronze\r\nimplements picked up among other rubbish in the muddy bed of an\r\nHelvetian lake open a long vista into the obscure history of primitive\r\nman.\r\n\r\nOn turning from Europe to the East we find other proofs that tin has\r\nbeen known from the most remote antiquity. It is mentioned in the Book\r\nof Numbers (xxxi. 22) among the spoil which the children of Israel\r\ngained by their victory over the Midianites; and Ezekiel, in his\r\nprophetic warning to the Tyrians, enumerates tin as forming part of\r\ntheir riches.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ST. MICHAEL’S MOUNT, CORNWALL.]\r\n\r\nIt is frequently noticed by Homer as a substance used for architectural\r\nornaments or for the embellishment of the armour of his heroes, and its\r\nGreek name ‘Kassiteros,’ which evidently represents the Sanscrit\r\n‘Kastira,’ leaves no doubt as to the part of the world from which it was\r\nfirst obtained. The tin which, in times unrecorded by chronology, served\r\nfor the consumption of Western Asia, Egypt, and Greece, was supplied by\r\nthe mines of India to the Phœnician traders, who conveyed it, either by\r\nland to Babylon, or by water to the ports of the Red Sea. At a much\r\nlater period that great merchant people extended their maritime\r\nexpeditions to the West, and sailing along the Atlantic coast of Gaul,\r\nultimately discovered Cornwall, which afforded them a new and\r\ninexhaustible supply of tin. With the jealous spirit of trade, they long\r\nmade a profound secret of its position; but about 450 years before\r\nChrist, Herodotus speaks of the Cassiterides, or tin islands, which some\r\nhave supposed to be Britain. Four centuries later Diodorus Siculus, who\r\nlived in the times of Julius Cæsar and Augustus, gives us an interesting\r\naccount of the ancient tin trade of Britain. ‘The inhabitants of that\r\nextremity of Britain which is called Bolerion’ (probably Land’s End),\r\nsays the historian whose narrative is the more deserving of attention as\r\nwe are told that he visited all the places he mentions: ‘both excel in\r\nhospitality and also, by reason of their intercourse with foreign\r\nmerchants, they are civilized in their mode of life. These prepare the\r\ntin, working very skilfully the earth which produces it. The ground is\r\nrocky, but it has in it earthy veins, the produce of which is brought\r\ndown and melted and purified. Then, when they have cast it into the form\r\nof cubes, they carry it to a certain island adjoining to Britain and\r\ncalled Iktis (probably St. Michael’s Mount). During the recess of the\r\ntide the intervening space is left dry, and they carry over abundance of\r\ntin to this place on their carts; and it is something peculiar that\r\nhappens to the islands in these parts lying between Europe and Britain,\r\nfor at full tide, the intervening passage being overflowed, they appear\r\nislands, but when the sea returns a large space is left dry and they are\r\nseen as peninsulas. From hence, then, the traders purchase the tin of\r\nthe natives and transport it into Gaul, and finally, travelling through\r\nGaul on foot, in about thirty days they bring their burdens on horseback\r\nto the river Rhone.’ Thus we learn from an authentic source how the tin\r\nof Cornwall found its way to Italy in the times of the first Roman\r\nEmperors; but long before that period the wild inhabitants of Cornwall\r\nmust have discovered the use of the metallic treasures of their barren\r\nsoil and the way to barter them for the commodities of the rude tribes\r\nof their own island or of the neighbouring nations of Gaul.\r\n\r\nWhen we consider the various and important uses to which tin may be\r\napplied, we cannot wonder at its importance in the commerce of the\r\nancient world. The discovery of bronze marks one of the great epochs in\r\nthe progress of human civilization, and the nations that could command\r\nits use became at once superior, in peace and war, to the tribes who had\r\nonly flint spear-heads for their defence or flint hatchets for the\r\nconstruction of their huts. At a later period, when iron gradually\r\nsupplanted the use of bronze for many purposes, tin still continued to\r\nbe highly esteemed for its many excellent qualities. Possessing a lustre\r\nbut little inferior to that of silver, it is not soon tarnished, and not\r\nonly retains its metallic brilliancy a long time, but when lost easily\r\nrecovers it. Under the hammer it is extended into leaves called tin-\r\nfoil, which are about one-thousandth of an inch thick, and might easily\r\nbe beaten into one-half that thickness if the purposes of trade required\r\nit. The application of tin to the coating of other metals has been\r\ncarried to great perfection, and it forms the chief ingredient in\r\nvarious kinds of pewter and other white metallic alloys, such as\r\nBritannia metal, which are manufactured into domestic utensils by\r\ncasting, stamping, and other ingenious processes. Tin is the substance\r\nwhich, coated with quicksilver, makes the reflecting surface of glass\r\nmirrors. It is also very important in dyeing processes, as its solutions\r\nin nitric, muriatic, and other acids gives a degree of permanency and\r\nbrilliancy to several colours not to be obtained by the use of other\r\nmordants. A compound of tin with gold gives the fine crimson and purple\r\ncolours to stained glass and artificial gems, and enamel is produced by\r\nthe fusion of oxide of tin with the materials of plate glass.\r\n\r\nThere are only two ores of tin—the peroxide, or tinstone, and the\r\npyrites, or stannine. The former alone occurs in sufficient abundance\r\nfor metallurgic purposes, and has been found in few countries in a\r\nworkable quantity. In Asia its richest deposits occur in Sumatra, the\r\npeninsula of Malacca, and some smaller islands, particularly Banca and\r\nBilliton. The stanniferous region in this part of Asia extends from 20°\r\nN. Lat. to 5° S. Lat., and in many places the ore is found in such\r\nquantities in the alluvial grounds as to be separated in the easiest\r\nmanner, by washing or ‘streaming,’ from the gravel or sand with which it\r\nis mixed. The facility with which it is obtained renders its cost of\r\nextraction so small that large quantities find their way to the European\r\nmarkets. In 1866 the mines of Banca furnished 5,362 tons of tin, and\r\nthose of the Sound 5,254 tons of the same metal. The port of London\r\nalone received 4,400 tons of tin from these two sources. In consequence\r\nof the constantly increasing importation from the Malay countries, the\r\nprice of the metal has been constantly decreasing since 1856, so that\r\nthe ton of ore, which at that time was worth 70_l._, now fetches no more\r\nthan 48_l._ Unfortunately these low prices have materially injured the\r\nprosperity of our Cornish mines, which from year to year find it more\r\ndifficult to compete with Banca and Billiton. Their production, however,\r\nstill continues to be immense, for in 1866 they yielded 15,080 tons of\r\nore, from which 9,990 tons of metal were extracted. This quantity is\r\ngreater than that of any preceding year; and as many of the deep mines\r\nof Cornwall are changing from copper into tin ore, increased supplies\r\nwill be obtained to meet any demand.\r\n\r\nCompared with this vast production, that of Saxony (seventy-six tons),\r\nBohemia (twenty-one tons), Spain, and France is so insignificant as to\r\nbe hardly worth mentioning; but our Australian possessions have lately\r\nincreased the small number of tin-producing countries, and give promise\r\nof future importance.\r\n\r\nBoth Cornwall and Devon possess tin mines, which, however, are most\r\nimportant in the county\r\n\r\n         ‘Where England, stretched towards the setting sun,\r\n         Narrow and long, o’erlooks the western wave.’—COWPER.\r\n\r\nThe undulating surface of this arid peninsula, which, being remarkable\r\nneither for agricultural nor foreign commerce, has been celebrated since\r\nthe remotest ages for the mineral riches concealed beneath its barren\r\nsoil, consists almost exclusively of slaty transition rocks or _killas_,\r\ntraversed or intersected by a central granitic range and by dykes of\r\nporphyry or _elvan_ which cut the slate and granite, occasionally\r\ntraversing both in one continuous body of rock, somewhat in the manner\r\nof trap-dykes, and evidently of a later formation. The lodes or mineral\r\nveins traverse the granite, the slate, and the elvan indiscriminately,\r\nbut they occur more especially at the junction of granite and slate.\r\nThey have commonly one prevailing direction, but they invariably throw\r\noff into the containing rock ‘shoots, strings, and branches,’ often in\r\nsuch abundance that, instead of one main lode, called a champion lode,\r\nthe whole is an irregular network of veins. It is not at all certain\r\nthat the same lode has ever been traced for more than a mile in length.\r\nVery often the lode first discovered dwindles to a mere line, whilst\r\nsome of its offshoots swell out, enlarge, and rival, or even surpass,\r\nboth in size and richness, the veins from which they have separated.\r\n\r\nThe metalliferous or valuable contents of a lode generally bear but a\r\nsmall proportion to its unprofitable parts. Instead of forming uniform\r\nlines of metal or pure ore, running throughout the whole extent of the\r\nvein, they generally occur in what the miners term _bunches_, or in\r\npatches of various sizes and shapes. These very rarely occupy the whole\r\nspace between the walls or containing sides of the lode, but they are\r\nmixed up with a variety of other substances, the chief of which is\r\nquartz.\r\n\r\nSometimes a lode is filled with a compact and perfectly solid mass; at\r\nother times it abounds in cavities which may occur in any one of the\r\ningredients and also of any size, from those of the hollows of a\r\nhoneycomb to hollows of several fathoms in length and depth.\r\n\r\nIn many lodes tin is found associated with copper, and frequently above\r\nthe latter, so that the upper part of many a copper lode has been worked\r\nas a tin lode.\r\n\r\nThe veins of Cornwall have no determinate size, being sometimes very\r\nnarrow, and at others exceeding several fathoms in width; sometimes they\r\nextend to a great length and depth, at others they end after a short\r\ncourse. They vary so in breadth that in the same lode one part may\r\nconsist of a mere line between the opposing walls, while another swells\r\nto a width of from thirty to forty feet. These great changes, however,\r\nseldom happen within several fathoms of each other. Lodes which yield\r\nboth tin and copper in mixture are considerably larger than those which\r\nyield each metal singly. It is also a general fact that the lodes\r\ndiminish in breadth in proportion to their depth. The richest tin ores\r\nare more commonly found between forty and sixty fathoms deep; but in\r\nsome instances, as in Dolcoath mine, the depth of 200 fathoms has been\r\nattained without exhausting the supply, and Tresavean mine has been\r\nworked to great profit at more than 320 fathoms from the surface. Tin\r\nveins are considered to be good working when only three inches wide,\r\nprovided the ore be good for its width.\r\n\r\nBesides being contained in lodes, tin is also found in alluvial beds,\r\nprobably resulting from the disintegration of the former during a long\r\nseries of ages. This stream-tin, as it is called, is met with either in\r\na pulverized sandy state in separate stones, called _shodes_, or in a\r\ncontinued course of stones, which are sometimes found together in large\r\nnumbers, and occur at depths varying from one to fifty feet. This course\r\nis called a stream, and when rich in ore was formerly called Beauheyl,\r\nwhich is a Cornish word signifying a ‘living stream.’ In the same\r\nfigurative style, when the stone was but lightly impregnated with tin,\r\nit was said to be ‘just alive,’ and dead when it contained no metal.\r\n\r\nTin streams of irregular breadth, though seldom less than a fathom, are\r\noften scattered in different quantities over the whole breadths of the\r\nmoor bottoms or valleys in which they are found. As the confluence of\r\nrivers makes a flood, so the meeting of tin-streams makes what is called\r\na rich ‘floor of tin.’ The ore, being thus disseminated both in the\r\nalluvium which covers the gentle slopes of the hills, and in that which\r\nfills the valleys winding round their base, is easily obtained by\r\nconveying over its bed a stream of water, which, by washing away the\r\nlighter matter, leaves the heavy ore to be picked up where the operation\r\nhas been performed.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that this was the oldest method of tin-getting,\r\nand the abundant traces of ancient stream-works which are to be seen\r\nfrom Dartmoor to the Land’s End give proof of the great accumulation\r\nwhich must have been formerly worked out by this method. In the course\r\nof ages most of these alluvial deposits have been exhausted, and where,\r\nthirty or forty centuries ago, large quantities of tin ore were\r\nsuperficially gathered with little ingenuity and labour, the miner is\r\nnow obliged to descend many a fathom deep into the bowels of the earth\r\nand work his slow way through the hard rock.\r\n\r\nYet, after so many centuries of research and extraction, tin-streaming\r\nis still carried on in several places, as, for instance, at Carnon,\r\nnorth of Falmouth, where a long line of stream-works extends down the\r\nvalley. The ore, mixed with rounded pieces of slate, granite, and\r\nquartz, lies buried about fifty feet from the surface, beneath the\r\nbottom of an estuary, where trees are discovered in their place of\r\ngrowth, together with human skulls and the remains of deer, amidst the\r\nvegetable accumulation which immediately covers the stanniferous beds.\r\nThus ruins are here piled up above ruins.\r\n\r\nIn 1866 the number of tin mines in activity amounted to 139 in Cornwall\r\nand to 26 in Devonshire. In 1852 the most important works were\r\nBalleswidden, Great Polgarth, Pollberro, and Drake Wall; but, as nothing\r\nis more fluctuating than the fortunes of mines, others have probably\r\ntaken the lead since that period.\r\n\r\nWheal Vor, in the parish of Breage, three miles from Helston, may be\r\ncited as a conspicuous example of the changes of fortune so frequent in\r\nthe annals of Cornish mining. Twenty-five years ago it was considered\r\nthe richest tin mine in Cornwall. More than 200,000_l._ profit had been\r\ndivided among the shareholders. In 1843 there were fifteen engines at\r\nwork on this extensive sett, which had the appearance of a town, and the\r\nmachinery was valued at 100,000_l._ Here was put up the first steam-\r\nengine ever erected in Cornwall, between the years 1710 and 1714. The\r\nlode from which the chief part of the ore was raised was still\r\nproductive in 1843, when the mine employed 1,200 persons, and the\r\nmonthly cost of working had been, some years before 1843, about\r\n12,000_l._ per month. The mine, however, became less profitable, and,\r\nwearing out by degrees, finally stopped.\r\n\r\nThere was formerly a blacksmith’s forge at the bottom of this mine, in\r\nfull operation at 1,470 feet below the surface of the earth. All the\r\nminers’ tools were steeled, sharpened, and repaired, and bucket-rods cut\r\nand welded in this subterranean smithy, which was clear and free from\r\ndust, smoke, and sulphur, and did not in the least annoy the miners.\r\nWithin the last few years the mine has been resuscitated with a capital\r\nof 200,000_l._; but, as the shares have fallen from 40_l._ to 8_l._, the\r\nattempt seems to have been far from profitable.\r\n\r\nThe history of the rise and fall of Huel Wherry,[54] a tin mine which\r\nwas opened, more than a century ago, in the midst of the sea, near the\r\ntown of Penzance, is too interesting to be passed over in silence. In\r\nthis place a gravelly bottom was left bare at low water. Here a\r\nmultitude of small veins of tin ore crossed each other in every\r\ndirection through elvan rocks, and were worked whenever the sea, the\r\ntide, and the season would permit, until the depth became unmanageable.\r\nAbout the year 1778 Thomas Curtis, a poor miner, was bold enough to\r\nrenew the attempt. The distance of the shoal from the neighbouring beach\r\nat high water is about 120 fathoms, and this distance, in consequence of\r\nthe shallowness of the beach, is not materially lessened at low water.\r\nIt is calculated that the surface of the rock is covered about ten\r\nmonths in the year, and that the depth of the water upon it at spring\r\ntide is nineteen feet. A very great surf is caused, even in the summer,\r\nby the prevailing winds, while in winter the sea bursts over the rock in\r\nsuch a manner as to render useless all attempts to carry on mining\r\noperations. Yet all these difficulties had to be overcome by a poor\r\nuneducated man. As the work could be prosecuted only during the short\r\ntime the rock appeared above water—a time still further abridged by the\r\nnecessity of previously emptying the excavation already made—three\r\nsummers were spent in sinking the pump-shaft, which was a work of mere\r\nbodily labour. A frame of boards, made watertight by pitch and oakum,\r\nand carried up to a sufficient height above the spring tide, was then\r\napplied to the mouth of the shaft. To support this boarded turret—which\r\nwas twenty feet high above the rock, and two feet one inch square—\r\nagainst the violence of the surge, eight stout bars were applied, in an\r\ninclined direction, to its sides, four of them below, and four, of an\r\nextraordinary length and thickness, above. A platform of boards was then\r\nlashed round the top of the turret, supported by four poles, which were\r\nfirmly connected with these rods. Lastly, upon this platform was fixed a\r\nwindlass for four men.\r\n\r\nFootnote 54:\r\n\r\n  ‘Cornwall, its Mines and Miners.’\r\n\r\nBy such an erection it was expected that the miners would be enabled to\r\npursue their operations at all times, even during the winter months,\r\nwhenever the weather was not particularly unfavourable. But as soon as\r\nthe excavation was carried, to some extent, in a lateral direction, the\r\nhope was disappointed, for the sea water penetrated through the fissures\r\nof the rock, and, in proportion as the workings became enlarged, the\r\nlabour of raising the ore to the mouth of the shaft increased. To add to\r\nall this, it was found impossible to prevent the water from forcing its\r\nway through the shaft during the winter months, or, on account of the\r\nswell and surf, to remove the tin-stone from the rock to the beach\r\nopposite. Hence the whole winter was a period of inaction, and the\r\nregular working of the mine could not be resumed before April.\r\nNevertheless, the short interval which was still allowed for labour\r\nbelow ground was sufficient to reward the bold and persevering\r\nprojector.\r\n\r\nThe close of this wonderful mine, from which many thousand pounds worth\r\nof tin was raised, was as romantic as its commencement. An American\r\nvessel broke from its anchorage in Gwavus Lake, and, striking against\r\nthe stage, demolished the machinery, and thus put an end to an adventure\r\nwhich, both in ingenuity and success, was in all probability unequalled\r\nin any country.\r\n\r\nThis wonderful mine was worked again a few years since; but, although a\r\nvery large sum of money was expended, and it had all the advantage of\r\nimproved machinery, yet it failed to be a profitable adventure, and was\r\neventually abandoned.\r\n\r\nThe Carclaze tin-mine, near the town of St. Austell, though unimportant\r\nwith regard to its produce, deserves to be noticed for its picturesque\r\nappearance and the manner in which it is worked. It consists of a large\r\nopen excavation, of a mile in circuit and from twenty to thirty fathoms\r\nin depth, looking more like a vast natural crater than a hollow made by\r\nhuman hands; and for hours the visitor might traverse the dreary and\r\nbarren hilly common in which it is situated without suspecting that a\r\nmine is close at hand. No engine-house and chimney towering aloft\r\nannounces it from afar; the whole business is confined to the interior\r\nof the punch-bowl hollow. Every detail of the works is here exposed to\r\nview, and it would seem as if a complete mine had been turned inside out\r\nfor the benefit of timid travellers, who would wish to see the various\r\noperations of mining without the risk of a descent below the surface.\r\n\r\nThe walls of this vast hollow or crater are almost perpendicular, and\r\nthe view from the ridge of the precipice, into which but few footpaths\r\ndescend, is rendered interesting by the fantastic shape of the rocks,\r\nworn or hewn into a thousand grotesque forms by the action of the waters\r\nor the pickaxe of the miner; by the enormous number of holes and hollows\r\nresulting from ancient excavations; by the white colour of the granite,\r\nveined with the darker metalliferous streaks; by the water-wheels at the\r\nbottom, which, worked by streams from the neighbouring commons, propel\r\nthe machinery for crushing the stones, loosened by the water as it flows\r\ndown the sides of the cavity; and by the men, women, and children,\r\nscattered over the works. The ore is obtained without much difficulty,\r\nand is easily separated from the friable and decomposed granite, in\r\nwhich it is embedded, by repeated washings in the streams that are made\r\nto flow out at the bottom of the mine through a channel or tunnel, and\r\nwhich carry away the soft _growan_ or granite by their rapid current,\r\nwhile the heavier metalliferous substances are precipitated.\r\n\r\nAs the ores are very poor, not even containing one per cent. of tin,\r\nCarclaze, which has been already worked for many centuries, would long\r\nsince have been abandoned but for the abundance of the ores and the\r\ncomparatively small expense of their extraction.\r\n\r\nThe dressing of the tin ores, or the process by which they are separated\r\nas far as possible from the earthy impurities which are mixed up with\r\nthem, and are generally much lighter, begins with cleaning and sorting,\r\nand then goes on to washing and stamping, and finally to calcination in\r\nthe burning-house and to smelting.\r\n\r\nThe tin ores of Cornwall and Devonshire are all reduced within the\r\ncounties where they are mined, as the law prohibits their exportation—a\r\nmost absurd and antiquated regulation, which, however, in this case is\r\nnot injurious to private interests, as the vessels which bring the fuel\r\nfrom Wales for the smelting furnaces return to Swansea and Neath laden\r\nwith copper ores. The smelting works, not exceeding seven or eight in\r\nnumber, belong generally not to the proprietors of the mines, but to\r\nother parties, who purchase the ore from the proprietors.\r\n\r\nThe smelting is effected by two different methods, which may be briefly\r\ndescribed by stating that, by the first and most common, the ore, mixed\r\nwith culm, is exposed to heat upon the hearth of a reverberating\r\nfurnace, in which pit coal is used as fuel; while by the second method,\r\nwhich is applied merely to stream-tin, and which is followed in order to\r\nobtain tin of the finest quality, the ore is fused in a blast-furnace\r\ncalled a blowing-house, in which wood fuel or charcoal is used. The\r\nmelted tin runs off from the furnace into an open basin, whence it flows\r\ninto a large vessel, where it is allowed to settle. The scoriæ are\r\nskimmed off, and the subsequent operations consist of refining by\r\nallowing the mass of the metal to rest, then submitting the upper and\r\npure portion to the refining basin, and remelting the lower part. In\r\norder to convert the blocks into _grain-tin_, they are heated until they\r\nbecome brittle, and made to fall from a considerable height in a semi-\r\nfluid state, thus producing an agglomerated mass of elongated grains.\r\n\r\nThe number of persons that find occupation in and about the Cornish and\r\nDevonian tin mines may amount to about 20,000. The wages are, on an\r\naverage, much inferior to those of the pitmen and pitlads in the\r\nnorthern coal-fields; but, on the other hand, the Cornish miner is\r\nexempt from many evils to which the northern miners are subject. He has\r\nnot to fear the fatal fire-damp, and can sit at ease and hear or read of\r\nexplosions that have destroyed hundreds in a few minutes.\r\n\r\nHis intellectual superiority to the agricultural labourer may be at once\r\ninferred from the nature of his pursuits. The latter plods on through\r\nlife like a mere human machine, and, as he is never thrown on his own\r\nresources in the progress of his monotonous occupations, his stock of\r\nideas remains scanty and confined. But the Cornish miner is the reverse\r\nof all this. He is engaged mostly in work requiring the exercise of the\r\nmind. He is constantly taking a new ‘pitch’[55] in a new situation,\r\nwhere his judgment is called into action. His wages are not the stinted\r\nrecompense of half-emancipated serfdom; but they arise from contract,\r\nand depend upon some degree of skill and knowledge. In fact the chances\r\nof the lode keep expectation constantly awake, and thus:—\r\n\r\n            ‘Hope reigns triumphant in the _miner’s_ breast,\r\n            Who never is, but always to be blest.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 55:\r\n\r\n  The lodes in the Cornish tin and copper mines are divided by shafts\r\n  and galleries into rectangular compartments, called ‘pitches.’ These\r\n  are open to the inspection of all the labouring miners in the county,\r\n  and, by an admirable system, each ‘pitch’ is let by public\r\n  competition, for two months, to two or four or more miners, who may\r\n  work it as they choose. These men agree to break the ores, wheel them,\r\n  raise them to the surface, and bring them (if desired) into a fit\r\n  condition for the market. The ores so raised are sold every week, and\r\n  the miner immediately receives his _tribute_, or percentage for which\r\n  he agreed to work. The sinking of shafts and the driving of levels is\r\n  paid by tut-work, or task work, at so much per fathom.\r\n\r\nIf he is at all imaginative, golden dreams enliven the darkness of his\r\nunderground labour. He is in fact a kind of subterranean stock-jobber,\r\nand ‘settling day’ is as anxious a time for the humble tributer at the\r\nLand’s End as for the bold speculator of the Stock Exchange.\r\n\r\nWhen not exhausted after his hard day’s labour, the miner frequently\r\ncultivates a small patch of land. Many have tolerable gardens, and some\r\nare able to perform their own carpentry, while, if near the coast,\r\nothers are expert fishermen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER XXVIII.\r\n                                 IRON.\r\n\r\nIron the most valuable of Metals—Its wide Diffusion over the Earth—\r\n  Meteoric Iron—Iron very anciently known—Extension of its Uses in\r\n  Modern Times—British Iron Production—Causes of its Rise—Hot Blast—\r\n  Puddling—Coal-smelting—The Cleveland District—Rapid Rise of\r\n  Middlesborough—British Iron Ores—Production of Foreign Countries—The\r\n  Magnetic Mountain in Russia—The Eisenerz Mountain in Styria—Dannemora—\r\n  Elba—The United States—The Pilot Knob—The Cerro del Mercado.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs an instrument of civilisation iron is the most valuable and the most\r\nindispensable of all mineral substances. Even coal is of inferior\r\nimportance to the welfare of mankind, for iron may be obtained without\r\nits aid, while coal could not possibly be extracted from the bowels of\r\nthe earth without the assistance of iron. Hard and malleable, tenacious\r\nand ductile, endowed with the singular property of welding, which is\r\nfound in no other metal except platinum, and acquiring new qualities by\r\nits conversion into steel, it accommodates itself to all our wants and\r\neven to our caprices, so that no other metal has such various and\r\nextensive uses. It clothes our war ships with a case of impenetrable\r\narmour, and sets the finest watch in motion; it provides the sempstress\r\nwith her needle, and guides the mariner over the ocean; it furnishes the\r\nhusbandman with his ploughshare, and the soldier with his sword; it\r\nconcentrates in the steam-engine the sinews of a thousand horses, and\r\nmocks on the railroad the fleetness of the swiftest courser. It is, in\r\none word, the embodiment of power, the chief agent of all social\r\nprogress.\r\n\r\n‘Were the use of iron lost among us,’ says the illustrious Locke, ‘we\r\nshould, in a few ages, be unavoidably reduced to the wants and ignorance\r\nof the ancient savage Americans;’ nor will this view be deemed\r\nextravagant if we reflect that, but for iron, man would be _virtually\r\nwithout_ tools, since it is almost the only metal capable of taking a\r\nsharp edge and keeping it.\r\n\r\nThe bounty of the Creator, which bestowed on man this inestimable gift,\r\nhas also provided for its wider diffusion over the earth than is the\r\ncase with any other of the useful metals. Few mineral substances or\r\nstones are without an admixture of it. Sands, clays, the waters of\r\nrivers or springs, are scarcely ever perfectly free from iron, while\r\nanimal and vegetable substances likewise afford it in the residues which\r\nthey leave after incineration. Its mines may truly be said to be\r\ninexhaustible; in some its ores occur in compact masses of extraordinary\r\nmagnitude, in others they spread in vast strata or extend in veins of a\r\nprodigious length.\r\n\r\nYet, in spite of its wide diffusion, the extraction of iron from its\r\nores generally requires so much metallurgic skill that its use would\r\nprobably have remained undiscovered by the ancients if Providence had\r\nnot in a wonderful manner revealed, as it were, its existence to\r\nmankind.\r\n\r\nAll iron of a _terrestrial_ origin is combined with other substances,\r\nwhich conceal its true nature from the uninitiated eye, and from which\r\nit is with difficulty separated; but here and there, scattered over the\r\nsurface of the earth, are found solitary masses of metallic iron, which,\r\nhaving fallen from the skies, may truly be called erratic boulders from\r\nanother world. The idea of their having dropped from the clouds was long\r\nridiculed by the learned; but their fall has been so often observed, and\r\nso circumstantially recorded in the annals of almost every age, that\r\nscepticism has been obliged to yield to the weight of accumulated\r\nevidence, and science no longer doubts their meteoric origin. Nothing\r\ncan be more interesting than these mysterious heralds from the distant\r\nfields of ether, which, after wandering through space for countless\r\nages, have at length been brought within the sphere of attraction of our\r\nplanet, and, alighting on its surface, afford us tangible proofs that\r\nmany of the substances of which our earth is composed—iron, nickel,\r\nsilex, &c., &c.—exist beyond its limits, and that most probably our\r\nwhole solar system is constructed of the same materials as our globe.\r\n\r\nBut meteoric iron—which sometimes occurs in enormous masses[56]—is more\r\nthan a mere object of curiosity, for it has had a most important\r\ninfluence on the progress of the human race. On such a mass undoubtedly\r\nthe _first smith_ exercised his skill, and it was this which first made\r\nmankind acquainted with a metal more valuable than copper or gold.\r\n\r\nFootnote 56:\r\n\r\n  The weight of the mass found at Otumpa, in the Gran Chaco Gualamba, in\r\n  South America, by Don Rubin de Celis (1783) was estimated at about\r\n  fifteen tons. A piece from this mass, weighing 1,400 pounds, is now in\r\n  the British Museum.\r\n\r\nAs we see from the example of the Esquimaux, whom Captain Ross (1819)\r\nfound in possession of knives and harpoons which they had made from\r\nmasses of meteoric iron, the discovery was probably made at a very\r\nremote period, while man was still in the savage state; but iron having\r\nonce become known, the desire to obtain it in larger quantities from\r\nother sources naturally grew with the progress of civilisation, and\r\ngradually led to the knowledge of its ores and of the art of utilising\r\nthem. Thus there can hardly be a doubt that iron-smelting was practised\r\nlong before historic times. In India and China the origin of its use\r\nloses itself in the remotest antiquity; and the imposing monuments of\r\nancient Egypt, many of which are at least five thousand years old, could\r\nnot possibly have been erected without the aid of iron. In the Book of\r\nDeuteronomy (iv. 20) the land of Egypt is compared to an iron-furnace—a\r\nfigurative expression which shows that even at that early period iron-\r\nsmelting must have been a well-known branch of industry.\r\n\r\nThe iron weapons found in the lacustrine dwellings of Switzerland\r\nlikewise point to a very ancient use of iron in Central Europe, no less\r\nthan the fact mentioned by Cæsar, that during the siege of Avaricum\r\n(Bourges) the works erected by the Romans for taking the town were\r\nrepeatedly destroyed by the subterranean galleries of the besieged, who,\r\nas the conqueror relates, were accustomed to such underground labour\r\nfrom their habitually working in iron-mines, an industry which, to judge\r\nfrom this passage, must even then have been of ancient date in Gaul.\r\n\r\nFor many ages the uses of iron remained chiefly confined to the\r\ninstruments of agriculture and of war—to the ploughshare and the sword.\r\nWith the progress of civilisation its employment extended to many\r\npurposes unknown before; and in our times the construction of ships and\r\nbuildings, of railroads and bridges, absorbs quantities which would have\r\nappeared incredible almost within the memory of living man. Hence the\r\nmanufacture of iron has made more rapid progress since the beginning of\r\nthe present century than in any former period of the world’s history,\r\nand even the present immense production scarcely keeps pace with a\r\ndemand to which it is not easy to assign a limit.\r\n\r\nAmong the iron-_producing_ countries of the globe Great Britain occupies\r\nby far the first rank, and there is every reason to believe that it will\r\nlong continue to maintain it. The British ores, indeed, are generally\r\npoor, as clay, silica, phosphorus, and a variety of impurities which are\r\nwith difficulty separated from the metal, enter into the composition of\r\nthose which supply the greatest part of our iron; but this deficiency is\r\nmore than counterbalanced by many advantages. Most of the British iron\r\nmines are situated in those districts where coal is cheapest, the ore\r\nbeing often even raised from the same pit as that from which the coal is\r\nextracted. Limestone, the necessary flux, is at hand, while fire-clay,\r\nno unimportant article in the building of the furnaces, on whose long-\r\ncontinued working so much depends, is found in the same ground as the\r\nore itself. The largest and most complete manufactories have long been\r\nestablished in the most convenient places. With an almost unlimited\r\namount of capital, the most perfect and the cheapest communication by\r\nwater is open to all parts of the world; and the further processes which\r\nthe metal has to undergo are performed at once on the spot in the best\r\nmanner and at the smallest possible expense. No other land can boast of\r\nequal or greater facilities for the production of an unlimited quantity\r\nof cheap iron, so that, even with the assistance of heavy protective\r\nduties, most of the iron-producing countries of Europe find it difficult\r\nto compete in their own markets with the produce of Great Britain.\r\n\r\nThe art of making iron in this country is of very ancient though of\r\nunascertained date. It was probably found by the Romans in a far\r\nadvanced state. It certainly was carried on by them subsequently to a\r\ngreat extent—a fact proved by the immense beds of iron cinders\r\ndiscovered in the Forest of Dean; nor has it ever been discontinued by\r\nthe other races who in succession have held sway in the island. But,\r\nthough of such ancient origin, and enjoying so many natural advantages,\r\nour iron manufacture remained confined within very narrow limits so long\r\nas the ore was exclusively smelted by means of charcoal made from wood.\r\nThe manufacture was even for some time partially prohibited in England,\r\nthe consumption of wood-charcoal in the process of smelting being so\r\ngreat as to create apprehensions that, if care were not taken of the\r\nremaining forests, enough timber would not be left to supply the wants\r\nof the navy. It seems almost incredible in our days that Acts were\r\npassed in the reigns of Elizabeth and James forbidding the felling of\r\ntimber for the smelting of iron, except in certain districts of Kent,\r\nSussex, and Surrey, then the principal seats of the manufacture, and\r\neven there the erection of new works was expressly forbidden.\r\n\r\nAttention was then directed to the smelting of ironstone by means of pit\r\ncoal. Amongst others, Lord Dudley gallantly struggled to establish a\r\nmanufactory in the neighbourhood of Stourbridge, and partially\r\nsucceeded; but what with riots among the ironworkers, who destroyed his\r\nworks, and the wars of the Great Rebellion, which ruined his fortune, he\r\nreaped no advantage from his enterprise. Nothing contributed to arrest\r\nthe decline in this branch of trade, and towards the middle of last\r\ncentury the number of furnaces, which in the reign of James I. had\r\namounted to 300, fell off to 59, the total make of which amounted to not\r\nmore than 17,350 tons, being an average of 294 tons per annum for each\r\nfurnace, a quantity very little exceeding that sometimes made in a\r\nsingle week in some of the huge furnaces in Wales in the present day.\r\nThe partial use of pit coal in the process of smelting was revived in\r\nCoalbrookdale, in Shropshire, about 1713. The chief difficulty was to\r\nkeep the coal in a state of combustion sufficiently intense for the\r\npurpose of smelting the ore; the hand-worked bellows, or the more\r\npowerful water movement, which produced blast enough for charcoal,\r\nhaving comparatively little effect upon coal.\r\n\r\nThis obstacle was finally overcome through the perseverance and\r\nenterprise of Dr. John Roebuck (a physician in Birmingham, and\r\ngrandfather of the late distinguished member for Sheffield), who,\r\nseeking for more economical methods of smelting iron ore than those then\r\nin use, founded in 1759 the now celebrated Carron Works, where John\r\nSmeaton, the illustrious architect of the Eddystone lighthouse, first\r\nintroduced (1760) a new contrivance for throwing a powerful and constant\r\nblast into the furnace. By means of a forcing pump, a large column of\r\nair, of triple or quadruple density to that which had been previously\r\nobtained, could now be poured into the furnace; and effects equivalent\r\nto this great improvement followed. The same smelting oven that formerly\r\nyielded ten or twelve tons weekly now sometimes produced forty tons in\r\nthe same period; and such was the impulse given to the trade by this\r\nunexpected success of a powerful blast with pit coal that in 1788 the\r\nmanufacture of pig-iron in England, Wales, and Scotland amounted to\r\n68,300 tons, being an increase of 50,950 tons on the quantity\r\nmanufactured previous to the introduction of pit coal.\r\n\r\nIn 1782 Mr. Cort, after many years of experiments, discovered the means\r\nof converting cast or pig-iron into malleable iron by a process which\r\nwas at once sure, rapid, and economical. The iron is remelted in a\r\npuddling furnace, as it is called, which is heated with raw coal, and\r\nthere, by a series of operations, the object of which is to give the\r\niron malleability and toughness by expelling the carbon, it is\r\nmanipulated until it acquires the consistency of a solid white-hot ball.\r\nIn this shape it is subjected to the action of an enormous hammer, by\r\nwhich the coarser parts are beaten from it, and it is formed into the\r\nshape of thick short bars, called blooms or slabs. While still red-hot\r\nit is passed through a series of grooved rollers, till it is drawn out\r\ninto a long bar, the exact dimensions of which are regulated by the\r\nrequirements of the manufacture for which it is destined. The bars thus\r\nmade are technically called puddled bars, and considered as _half-\r\nmanufactured_ iron. To refine them into _merchant_-iron, they are again\r\nsubmitted to the action of fire, and, when hot enough, are welded\r\ntogether and formed into the various denominations of bars, rods, hoops,\r\nsheets, or plates. Mr. Cort’s discovery, though of immense importance,\r\nwould yet have proved of comparatively small value without the aid of\r\nthe double-power steam-engine, which was about the same time invented by\r\nJames Watt, and supplied the power which was needed to give our iron-\r\nworks their full development.\r\n\r\nHitherto the ‘top measures’ only of the mineral had been worked, and\r\ngenerally on ‘the rise of the mine,’ where the water would not lie, or\r\nthose strata favourably situated on the side of a hill where levels\r\ncould be driven in and the water released. Water was the great enemy in\r\nthe pits, and even in shallow workings it often accumulated faster than\r\na gin turned by horse-power could bring it to the surface. By the new\r\nagency of steam the deepest pits were drained, and materials were drawn\r\nup from the bowels of the earth in a quantity and with a rapidity and\r\nsecurity hitherto unknown. By the same means that prodigious blast was\r\nobtained for the furnaces to which all subsequent improvements of the\r\nmanufacture owe their origin. Instead of the rude machinery of\r\nwaterwheels and bellows, huge engines of enormous power forced an\r\nimmense volume of air through several small _tuyeres_ or tubes so\r\ndisposed at the lower part of the furnaces that in each portion of the\r\nignited mass an equally diffused blast might raise an equal intensity of\r\nheat. Furnaces of greater height and much larger capacity than any\r\nhitherto known were erected, and in its general aspect the iron\r\nmanufacture assumed very much the appearance which it maintains at the\r\npresent day.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  BLAST FURNACE.\r\n  _a._ Tuyeres.\r\n]\r\n\r\nMost readers are aware[57] that the flaming towers which give such an\r\nunearthly effect at night to what is called the Black Country, round\r\nWolverhampton, are iron furnaces, and that the projecting circular\r\ngalleries which surround their tops are contrived for pouring down their\r\ncapacious throats, by apertures placed at equal distances, an equable\r\nand regular supply of the materials with which they are fed. Besides the\r\niron-stone and the fuel, there is needed a third substance, which is\r\ncalled ‘a flux,’ because it forms a fusible compound with the earthy\r\nmatter of the mineral. When we are acquainted with the foreign matter in\r\ncombination with the ore, chemistry tells us what substance we ought to\r\nadd for the purpose of eliminating the metal. Among the wonderful\r\nprovisions of nature for the convenience of man, none is more remarkable\r\nthan that by which many substances are fusible in conjunction at a\r\ntemperature which either could resist separately. The British ores are\r\nfor the most part argillaceous, that is to say, they are combined with\r\nwhat, in its general character and appearance, resembles clay. To all\r\nsuch limestone in due proportion must be added; but if the earthy matter\r\nconsists of lime, clay is the proper flux. In either case the foreign\r\nmatter and the flux are fused into one substance. The liberated iron\r\nsinks downwards, and having now itself become fusible by the combination\r\nof carbon, with which it has been impregnated by the fuel, it melts as\r\nit reaches the point of fusion, and settles down in the lowest part of\r\nthe furnace, otherwise called the hearth. It is followed by the scoria,\r\nslag, or ‘cinder’ (as it is always called in the trade), composed of the\r\nflux, the foreign matter of the ores, and the ashes of the fuel, which\r\nare now in a vitrified state; and this artificial lava, being of much\r\nless specific gravity, rests on the surface of the iron and protects it\r\nfrom the action of the blast. The furnace is ‘continued in blast,’ that\r\nis to say, in full operation, and must be fed equably and constantly\r\nnight and day, till the manufacturer thinks fit to blow it out, either\r\nfor the purpose of repairing it, or of reducing his make of iron. At\r\ncertain intervals, generally twice in the twenty-four hours, the furnace\r\nis tapped; that is to say, the stoppage of sand which closes an orifice\r\nat the bottom is knocked away, the liquefied metal rushes out, and is\r\nguided successively into moulds of sand in the form of short thick bars,\r\nwhich, by a rude metaphor, as old as the invention of casting, are\r\ncalled ‘pigs,’ while the main channel down which the red-hot torrent\r\nflows is called the ‘sow.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 57:\r\n\r\n  ‘Quarterly Review,’ vol. cix. p. 114.\r\n\r\nThe invention of the hot blast gave a new and mighty impulse to the\r\nproduction of iron. Though Mr. Scrivenor[58] mentions the remarkable\r\nfact that in the furnaces of Peru a contrivance has been noticed for\r\nletting the air pass over hot coals, and thus become heated in its\r\npassage to the fire, yet it was personal observation, and not\r\narchæological research, that, in 1829, suggested to Mr. Neilson, of the\r\nClyde Iron Works, the possibility of economising fuel by substituting\r\nhot for cold air in blowing his furnaces. Before this important\r\ndiscovery more than eight tons of coke had been required to produce one\r\nton of pig-iron; but on heating the blast, previously to its entering\r\nthe smelting-oven, to a temperature of 300° F., it was found that a\r\nsaving of two and a half tons of coal could be made on every ton of\r\niron, and on raising it to the temperature of 600° F.—a heat somewhat\r\nmore than sufficient to melt lead—a still more considerable saving of\r\nfuel was effected, while at the same time the important discovery was\r\nmade that at this high temperature bituminous and even anthracitic coal\r\nmight be used instead of coke. Another advantage was that the same steam\r\npower now sufficed for applying the blast to four furnaces which had\r\nformerly been required for three; and the total result of the\r\nimprovement was a saving of 72 per cent. of fuel. Thus we have here\r\nanother instance of the important results that may be gained from a\r\nsingle good idea when worked out by clever practical men, for the hot\r\nblast has most assuredly increased the wealth of England by many\r\nmillions a year!\r\n\r\nFootnote 58:\r\n\r\n  ‘History of the Iron Trade.’\r\n\r\nAnother circumstance likewise tended considerably to increase the\r\nproduction of pig-iron. It was found that the hot blast not only had\r\npower sufficient to produce in the raw coal the requisite intensity of\r\nheat, but also to expel from it, to a certain extent, the sulphur, which\r\ninjured the quality of the iron, and thus a great economy in labour as\r\nwell as in the quantity of fuel was effected. Since then the black-band,\r\nan iron-stone found in great quantities in Scotland, and also, to a less\r\nextent, in Wales, but not readily convertible into iron by the old\r\nmethods, and also the Northamptonshire and the Cleveland ores,\r\ndiscoveries of a later date and of an incalculable extent, have been\r\nmade by the hot blast to yield their iron in great abundance.\r\n\r\nThe power of using the black-band alone in the furnace, and not, as\r\nbefore the introduction of the hot blast, in small quantities only, and\r\ncombined with other ores, constituted a new era in the manufacture of\r\niron, and gave to Scotland, till then an iron-making district of little\r\nimportance,[59] the pre-eminence over all others for the production of\r\nsoft fluid iron, best suited to ordinary founding purposes.\r\n\r\nFootnote 59:\r\n\r\n  The metal was formerly so scarce in their country that in the times of\r\n  the Edwards the Scotch were accustomed to make predatory incursions\r\n  into England for the sake of the iron they could carry off. Now they\r\n  not only manufacture sufficient for their own use, but actually export\r\n  above half-a-million tons.\r\n\r\nThe Cleveland district, formerly unknown in metallurgy, is now the seat\r\nof a vast industry, keeping more than a hundred furnaces in blast.\r\n\r\nThe head-quarters of this new iron-country are established at\r\nMiddlesborough, on whose site there existed but one house in 1829, but\r\nwhich in 1861 had grown into a town of 24,000 inhabitants, and still\r\nincreases at the rate of 1,000 a year. Branch railways bring the stone\r\nhere for smelting from all the neighbouring quarries, and the dense\r\ncloud of smoke that hangs over the place serves as a land-mark, not only\r\nfrom the high ground of Yorkshire, but even from some parts of\r\nWestmoreland.\r\n\r\nBut Middlesborough, ‘the youngest child of England’s enterprise’ as it\r\nhas been called by Mr. Gladstone, is by no means one of the loveliest of\r\nher offspring. Scarcely a blade of grass and not a single tree relieves\r\nthe dull monotony of its dreary streets of small houses, darkened by\r\nperpetual smoke, which, as the wind sways it, affords, at rare\r\nintervals, glimpses of distant hills or of the Tees, serving only to\r\nmake the prison of a town more gloomy. Mines and furnaces have also been\r\nestablished in other parts of the district—in Rhosdale, at Grosmont near\r\nWhitby, and elsewhere—and not a year passes without the opening of new\r\nveins and the rising of new smoke-clouds amid the lovely dales of north-\r\nwestern Yorkshire. The iron which eventually finds its way to\r\nMiddlesborough is sent thence to every part of the world. Its quality is\r\nessentially inferior to that derived from the coal-measures; but for\r\nordinary purposes, and for mixing with the finer classes, it is of great\r\nvalue. Looking to the future, we cannot doubt that the Middlesborough\r\ndistrict is destined to have no rival in any part of the world, for even\r\nnow its works compete in magnitude with those of our old iron fields.\r\n\r\nA material which had hitherto been thrown away was also, by the agency\r\nof the hot blast, made available for the purposes of the iron master.\r\nThe ‘tap cinder,’ or refuse of the puddling furnace, which is not to be\r\nconfounded with the cinder of the blast furnace, contains a considerable\r\npercentage of metal, and when thrown again into the furnace greatly\r\nincreases the yield, though it proportionally deteriorates the quality\r\nof the iron. The results of all these successive discoveries and\r\ninnovations, aided by the facilities of transport afforded by canals and\r\nrailroads, are truly astonishing.\r\n\r\nThe make of iron which, on the introduction of steam, had suddenly risen\r\nto nearly 50,000 tons per annum, reached 125,000 in 1796, and in 1806\r\nhad advanced to nearly 260,000. In 1825 the make was nearly 600,000\r\ntons; in 1840 it amounted to 1,300,000 tons; and in 1854 to 2,700,000\r\ntons. In 1865 it reached the enormous figure of 4,819,254 tons—as much\r\nas the combined production of Continental Europe and the United States;\r\nand there is little doubt that the present yield does not fall much\r\nshort of 6,000,000 tons! A similar colossal expansion is without a\r\nparallel in the annals of metallurgic industry.\r\n\r\nThe chief districts which furnish this incredible quantity of iron are\r\nsituated in Yorkshire, South Wales, Staffordshire, Durham, Lancashire,\r\nCumberland, Shropshire, Derbyshire, and the West of Scotland.\r\n\r\nThe number of furnaces in blast in 1865 were, in England 376,\r\ndistributed over 176 iron-works; in Wales 135, distributed over 49\r\nworks; and in Scotland 141, over 32. To supply these furnaces there were\r\nraised 9,910,045 tons of ore, the estimated value of which at the place\r\nof production was 3,324,804_l._, that of the pig-iron, at the mean\r\naverage cost at the place of production, being 12,048,133_l._\r\n\r\nOf the iron-stone, 1,384,500 tons were argillaceous carbonate from the\r\ncoal-measures of Staffordshire and Worcestershire; 3,166,000 tons from\r\nthe Yorkshire mines; nearly 1,500,000 tons from the coal-measures of\r\nNorth and South Wales, and 1,500,000 tons argillaceous carbonate from\r\nScotland.\r\n\r\nOf the red hematites of Whitehaven and Ulverstone, which consist almost\r\nentirely of peroxide of iron, and are reckoned among our best ores,\r\n214,433 tons were smelted at the spot, and 937,386 tons exported for the\r\nsupply of Staffordshire, South Wales, and other districts.\r\n\r\nThe brown hematite (brown oxide of iron) of the Forest of Dean, where\r\nthe ore exists in almost unlimited quantity, is raised exclusively for\r\nshipment to the iron-works of South Wales. Though not rich, yet, from\r\nthe great masses in which it is found, its cost of production is very\r\nlow.\r\n\r\nThe finest iron ores, such as the black oxide or magnetite, specular\r\niron, and spathose iron, or sphærosiderite, which furnish the best kinds\r\nof iron, are unfortunately but of rare occurrence in Great Britain.\r\n\r\nAs we see by the following table[60] of the production of cast iron in\r\nthe chief European mining States—\r\n\r\n         ┌───────────────┬──────┬──────────┬──────┬──────────┐\r\n         │Countries      │ Years│   Tons   │ Years│   Tons   │\r\n         ├───────────────┼──────┼──────────┼──────┼──────────┤\r\n         │Great Britain  │  1840│ 1,400,000│  1865│ 4,527,000│\r\n         │France         │  1845│   271,000│  1864│ 1,213,000│\r\n         │Prussia        │  1835│    32,800│  1865│   772,000│\r\n         │Belgium        │  1845│   134,500│  1864│   450,000│\r\n         │Russia         │  1838│   171,000│  1865│   278,000│\r\n         │Austria        │  1835│   200,000│  1865│   259,000│\r\n         │Sweden         │  1835│    97,500│  1865│   227,000│\r\n         │Spain          │  1850│    26,000│  1865│    48,000│\r\n         │Italy          │  1838│    20,000│  1865│    27,000│\r\n         └───────────────┴──────┴──────────┴──────┴──────────┘\r\n\r\nFrance occupied the next rank to Great Britain in 1864; but since 1866\r\nPrussia, besides the rapid development of the iron industry in\r\nWestphalia and the Rhenish provinces, has acquired new and valuable\r\nmines by the annexation of Hanover and Nassau. Her production had\r\nconsequently risen to 1,000,000 tons in 1868, and probably the time is\r\nnot far distant when she will have outstripped France. Nassau possesses\r\ninexhaustible supplies of specular iron ore of a remarkable purity,\r\nwhich not only feed the blast furnaces of Westphalia, but are also\r\nlargely exported to England.\r\n\r\nFootnote 60:\r\n\r\n  From the official reports of the International Jury of the Universal\r\n  Exhibition of 1867 in Paris.\r\n\r\nIn proportion to the smallness of her territory Belgium rivals Great\r\nBritain in the production of iron, supplied exclusively by the brown\r\noxide (brown hematite), and surpasses the vast empire of the Czar.\r\n\r\nBut Russia has the advantage over all the countries previously mentioned\r\nof possessing inexhaustible deposits of magnetic iron ore (magnetic\r\nloadstone—magnetite) which affords bar-iron of the very best quality;\r\nand though hitherto the immense distances which separate the mines from\r\nthe larger centres of consumption have retarded the progress of the iron\r\nmanufacture, the construction of railroads is gradually overcoming these\r\nobstacles, and possibly even the now unworked Siberian mines of the\r\nAltaï and of Transbaikalia, where coal is found along with iron, may\r\nacquire importance at a not far distant time. At present the chain of\r\nthe Oural (Permia and Orenburg) furnishes nine-tenths of all the iron\r\nproduced in the empire. The most remarkable of the Ouralian mines is the\r\nfamous magnetic mountain Wissokaja Gora, in the neighbourhood of Nishne-\r\nTagilsk, which Peter the Great bestowed in 1702 on the armourer Nikita\r\nDemidoff of Tula, along with a vast extent of forests and arable land.\r\nThis magnetic mountain or hill, which is 300 fathoms long, 250 broad,\r\nand 240 feet high, rises from the midst of a plain, in the form of a\r\nbroad, flat eminence. It consists almost entirely of _pure magnetic iron\r\nore_, and is worked like an open quarry; but, on account of its\r\nhardness, the ore requires to be blasted with powder. Although many\r\nmillions of tons have been extracted from it since it first came into\r\nthe possession of the Demidoff family, it may easily be imagined that a\r\nmass of at least 600,000,000 cubic feet of iron-ore is not easily\r\nremoved, and will outlast the labours of many generations. The quantity\r\nof cast-iron annually produced amounts to 25,500 tons, which is\r\nconverted, partly at Nishne-Tagilsk and partly in the neighbouring\r\nforges, into bar-iron, anchors, kettles, scythes, nails, wire, &c. The\r\nexcellent quality of the iron allows it to be rolled into very thin\r\nplates, which are frequently made use of in Russia for the roofing of\r\nhouses, and are also manufactured at Nishne-Tagilsk into lacquered\r\nwares, which find a ready sale throughout the whole of European and\r\nAsiatic Russia.\r\n\r\nThe iron-working industry of Austria has its chief seats in Styria,\r\nCarinthia, Transylvania, and Bohemia, and, though out of proportion with\r\nthe vast natural resources of the empire, has of late made rapid\r\nprogress. The ores, which are of an excellent quality, are mostly\r\nsmelted with charcoal, as they are generally situated at a great\r\ndistance from the coal mines. The Noric or Styrian iron has enjoyed an\r\nexcellent reputation ever since the time of the Romans, when the\r\nimperial manufactory of Laureacum on the Danube supplied the legions\r\nwith swords and javelins.\r\n\r\nIn a pass of the Styrian Alps, between the valleys of the Mur and the\r\nEnns, lies one of the most remarkable iron mines in the world, the\r\nfamous Erzberg or iron-mountain, which rises to a height of 3,000 feet,\r\nand whose summit and sides are almost everywhere coated with a thick\r\nmantle of the richest ore. Authentic records show that it has been\r\nworked ever since the year 712; and probably the Romans derived a part\r\nof their Noric iron from this source, as the ore is not here concealed\r\nin the bowels of the earth, but crops out on the surface, near a\r\nmountain pass which was undoubtedly known to them. As at Nishne-Tagilsk,\r\nthe ore thus conveniently situated is quarried from the mountain, and\r\nthus in course of time extensive excavations or grottoes have been\r\nformed all over its surface, affording a most interesting spectacle. The\r\nbottom of these iron-stone pits is irregularly strewn with large blocks\r\nof ore through which wind narrow footpaths. Roads lead from one pit to\r\nthe other, and close by are situated the small huts in each of which ten\r\nor twenty of the miners sleep as long as the working season lasts, for\r\ntheir families generally live lower down in the deeper valleys. On the\r\ntop of the mountain stands a colossal crucifix of iron, near which an\r\nannual thanksgiving feast is celebrated. Though the mines are easily\r\nworked, the conveyance of their produce to the smelting-ovens of\r\nEisenerz and Vordernberg is a matter of much greater difficulty, and\r\nrequires numerous tram-roads, galleries, and shafts, through which the\r\nore is precipitated from a higher to a lower level. At the foot of the\r\nmountain they all unite in one main shaft, which leads into a gallery\r\nornamented with a monumental gate. Thus the whole of the Erzberg is\r\ncovered with various machines, pits, horizontal and vertical galleries,\r\ntunnels, and roads, and represents as it were a _mine turned inside\r\nout_, where all the operations which are elsewhere performed underground\r\nare, as at the Carclaze tin-mine in Cornwall, exposed to the open day.\r\nHere, instead of dirty and dangerous ladders, convenient footpaths,\r\nbordered with trees and illumined by the sun, lead from gallery to\r\ngallery and from pit to pit, and instead of being confined in dismal\r\npassages, the miner enjoys magnificent views of the grandest Alpine\r\nscenery. The annual produce of the Erzberg amounts to 25,000 tons of\r\nexcellent iron, as the ore (sparry iron, carbonate of iron,\r\nsphærosiderite) is nearly as pure as the magnetic iron-stone of Russia,\r\nand affords natural steel with the greatest facility. The railroad now\r\nbeing built in Styria will no doubt greatly increase this production,\r\nwhich might be continued for many thousand years without exhausting the\r\nvast mineral wealth which Nature has here deposited.\r\n\r\nThough Sweden furnishes but an insignificant quantity of iron when\r\nmeasured by an English scale, yet, in point of quality, its produce is\r\nunrivalled in the world. The purest iron-ores (magnetic iron-stone)\r\nabound in the mountain chains which traverse the kingdom, and immense\r\nforests afford almost inexhaustible supplies of charcoal for their\r\nsmelting, so that hitherto the want of roads has alone prevented the\r\nproduction of iron from attaining dimensions equal to the natural\r\nresources of the country. Many of the richest mines, particularly in the\r\nmore northern provinces, have never yet been worked, as for instance the\r\nenormous mounds of magnetic iron-ore at Gellivara (67° N. lat.) in\r\nSwedish Lapland, beyond the Arctic circle, which, from their situation\r\nin a polar desert, have hitherto been totally useless. In 1865 an\r\nattempt was made to utilize them by means of a railroad and the\r\ncanalization of the river Luleo, but after a heavy expense the works\r\nwere finally abandoned.\r\n\r\nThus the manufacture of iron, which, under more favourable\r\ncircumstances, would reach as far as its ores extend, is confined to\r\nDalecarlia, the more central provinces of Kopperberg, Wermland, and\r\nUpsala, where the celebrated mines of Dannemora, which furnish the fine\r\nOeregrund iron, largely imported into England for the manufacture of\r\nsteel, deserve our particular notice, both for their ancient renown and\r\ntheir wild and colossal grandeur. An excellent road leads from the\r\nfamous university town of Upsala to Old Upsala, old and hoary in the\r\nfullest sense of the word, for its church dates from the Pagan times,\r\nand close by rise three tumuli which, according to popular tradition,\r\ncontain the remains of no less important personages than Odin, Thor, and\r\nthe divine Freya.\r\n\r\nFurther on towards the north-east, six geographical miles from Upsala,\r\nlie the iron-works of Oesterby, remarkable for their beautiful situation\r\nin a natural park of forests and lakes, and thence half an hour’s walk\r\nover the plain brings one to the far-famed pit of Dannemora.\r\n\r\nThe country around is perfectly level, a succession of pine-woods and\r\nopen grounds, and no sign announces the vicinity of the mine, until at\r\nlength the traveller sees a few huts and some machines for lifting the\r\nore, and then suddenly stands on the brink of an enormous pit, or rather\r\nof a vast crater, whose black and precipitous walls inclose an area of\r\nat least a mile in circumference. On looking down into the abyss, which\r\ndescends to a depth of 450 feet, and is here and there enlivened with\r\npatches of perennial snow, he perceives along its black walls the still\r\nblacker entrances to labyrinthine caves fringed in some parts with long\r\nstalactites of ice of aquamarine transparency and colour. From some of\r\nthese hollows the flames of piles of fir-wood are seen to creep along\r\nthe hard rock which they are to soften, and the deep gulf is animated by\r\ntroops of miners, the distant clang of whose hammers, closely resembling\r\nthe clicking of a number of clocks, forms a strange concert with the\r\ncreaking noise of the machinery. Attracted by the novelty of the\r\ninteresting sight, the eye wanders from one object to another, and time\r\nsteals on rapidly and unperceived—when suddenly a bell tolls, and the\r\nscene as suddenly changes.\r\n\r\nIt is noon, and the tuns, which before were hauled up from the deep\r\nladen with ore, are now seen ascending with a living freight—men, women,\r\nand children—standing quite unconcernedly on the narrow edge of the tub,\r\nand holding with one hand the chain to which it is attached.\r\n\r\nSoon a deathlike silence reigns in the pit—a striking contrast with the\r\nnoise and life it erewhile displayed—and now loud shouts are heard,\r\nwarning all those who may have remained behind that the battery prepared\r\nduring the previous working hours is about to explode. Again a profound\r\nsilence—and then loud thunder bursts forth, with many an echo, from the\r\ndepth of the abyss.\r\n\r\nFor several minutes the whole neighbourhood trembles as if shaken by an\r\nearthquake. Through the black clouds of smoke which ascend from the\r\ngulf, pieces of stone or ore are hurled upwards, frequently far beyond\r\nthe brink of the pit, and most of the detonations are followed by the\r\ncrash of the falling fragments rent by the explosion from the mother-\r\nrock.\r\n\r\nFor many centuries this remarkable mine has afforded employment to many\r\nhundreds of workmen, without showing any signs of exhaustion, for its\r\nmighty mass of magnetic iron-ore descends to an unknown depth and seems\r\nto be practically inexhaustible.\r\n\r\nThough the mineral resources of Spain are immense, yet its iron-industry\r\nis so little developed that more than two-thirds of the excellent ores\r\nof Biscay, instead of being smelted in the country, are exported to\r\nFrance and England.\r\n\r\nIn Italy the red oxide and magnetic iron-stone mines of Elba have been\r\ncelebrated since the remotest antiquity, but, from the want of fuel on\r\nthe island, their entire produce, which amounts to about 100,000 tons,\r\nis exported to the coast of Italy, to France, and to England. The\r\nprincipal mines are situated on the slope of a steep mountain fronting\r\nthe sea, and are divided by horizontal terraces into five stories or\r\nhuge steps communicating with each other by means of oblique roads, on\r\nwhich carts convey the ores to the shore. Though worked for more than\r\n2,000 years, the mines, which occupy about 700 workmen, are apparently\r\nable to supply the wants of the remotest posterity.\r\n\r\nOn turning to America we find the United States making gigantic strides\r\nin the extension of their iron manufacture, which has risen from 347,000\r\ntons in 1840 to 1,200,000 tons in 1864; and as here none of the elements\r\nof progress are wanting—a boundless mineral wealth, liberal\r\ninstitutions, which allow the freest scope to individual energy, and an\r\nunrivalled spirit of enterprise—there can hardly be a doubt that finally\r\nthe United States must become the first iron-country in the world. The\r\nmasses of magnetic iron-stone and red oxide which extend along Lake\r\nSuperior, over a length of 120 miles and a breadth of from five to\r\nthirty, would alone suffice to provide for the wants of the whole of the\r\nhuman race for many thousands of years. They only began to be worked in\r\n1849; and in 1866 the railroad which leads from the mines transported\r\n204,454 tons of ore.\r\n\r\nThe thriving town of Marquette, the central point of this new seat of\r\nindustry, was, scarcely twenty years ago, a complete wilderness, where\r\nthe Red Indian pursued the beasts of the forest, unconscious that the\r\ntreasures concealed beneath his natal soil would one day be the cause of\r\nhis expulsion from the hunting-grounds of his fathers.\r\n\r\nThe State of Missouri possesses two ‘iron-mountains’ similar to the\r\nmagnetic mountain of the Demidoff: one of them called Pilot Knob is 600\r\nfeet high, the other 220. An immense mass of magnetic oxide has also\r\nbeen discovered in California, near the northern extremity of the Sierra\r\nNevada. But though iron is found in abundance in many parts of the\r\nUnion, (Tennessee, North and South Carolina, Georgia, &c.), the States\r\nof New York and Pennsylvania produce by far the greatest quantity.\r\n\r\nBrazil and the island of Cuba likewise contain vast deposits of the\r\nrichest iron-ores; and in Mexico we find the famous Cerro del Mercado,\r\nan iron-mountain 633 feet high, which rises in grotesque form from the\r\nvalley of Durango. This wonderful mound has been calculated to contain\r\n3,244,000,000 cubic feet, or 454,000,000 tons, of magnetic iron ore,\r\ncapable of yielding 290,000,000 tons of cast iron, or more than fifty\r\ntimes the annual production of Great Britain! A more industrious and\r\ncivilised race would here find a boundless field for profitable\r\nemployment; but the indolent Mexican, steeped in ignorance and falling\r\nfrom one revolution into another, still leaves these treasures almost\r\nuntouched, and, neglecting the vast resources of his country, draws\r\nnearly his whole supply of iron from the distant forges of Great\r\nBritain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXIX.\r\n                                 LEAD.\r\n\r\nIts Properties and extensive Uses—Alston Moor—Belgian Lead Mines—Galena\r\n  in America—Extraction of Silver from Lead Ores—Pattinson’s Process—A\r\n  great part of our wealth is due to the laboratory.\r\n\r\n\r\nLead was but little prized by the ancients, who, unacquainted with\r\ngunpowder, needed no bullets for war or for the chase. The history of\r\nits first discovery is lost in obscurity, but it probably became known\r\nmuch later than copper or tin, as less metallurgic skill is required for\r\nthe smelting of the cupreous or stanniferous ores than for the reduction\r\nof galena or sulphide of lead, which is the most abundant of the\r\nplumbiferous ores, and may indeed be regarded as the only commercial ore\r\nof any value, if we except the carbonates, which are probably formed by\r\nits decomposition.\r\n\r\nLead, however, is mentioned both in the Book of Job and in the fourth\r\nbook of Moses, ‘Oh! that my words were graven with an iron pen on\r\ntablets of lead,’ exclaims the long-suffering patriarch, and the\r\nlegislator of the Jews commands his people to ‘make go through the fire,\r\ngold, silver, brass, tin, and lead, and everything that may abide it.’\r\nThe Phœnicians, who provided Greece and Egypt with Spanish lead,\r\nfrequently made use of this metal to increase the weight of their\r\nanchors; and Herodotus, describing a bridge in Babylon, mentions that\r\nits stones were fastened with clasps of iron soldered with lead. The\r\nphysical properties of this metal qualify it for a great variety of\r\nuses. As it is but little altered by exposure to air or water, it makes\r\nexcellent pump-tubes and rain-gutters; while its considerable weight,\r\nits softness, its flexibility, and the facility with which it melts at a\r\ncomparatively low temperature render it an invaluable material for the\r\nsoldier’s bullet or the huntsman’s shot. Combined with oxygen it forms\r\nthe pigment called red-lead, or minium, and united with carbonic acid\r\nwhite-lead, or ceruse, which is still more frequently used in painting.\r\n\r\nIn the manufacture of glass and crystal it plays an important part, as\r\nit forms one of the chief ingredients of flint-glass and crown-glass, of\r\nwhich, as is well known, the achromatic lenses are made which have so\r\nwonderfully improved the distinctness of our telescopes. United with tin\r\nit forms an alloy which is more fusible than either metal alone, and\r\nwhich is consequently used as a solder by the plumbers, while with\r\nantimony it combines into a hard mass which serves to make letters for\r\nthe printing-press. All these various uses absorb immense quantities of\r\nlead, and render it one of the most valuable products of the\r\nsubterranean world.\r\n\r\nAmong the lead mines of Europe we find the first rank occupied by those\r\nof Spain, which in 1863 furnished the enormous mass of 309,940 tons of\r\ngalena. The principal mines are situated in Guipuzcoa, Catalonia,\r\nArragon, the Sierra Morena, and, above all, in the mountain chain of the\r\nAlpujarras, where the rocks of the Sierra Gador are everywhere traversed\r\nby veins of galena. The production of North Germany is also very\r\nconsiderable. In 1865 Prussia furnished 57,808 tons of galena, and the\r\nHanoverian Hartz Mountains, which produced 101,411 tons in 1864, and now\r\nbelong to the same monarchy, have raised its previous production to a\r\nthreefold amount.\r\n\r\nThe chief lead mines of England are situated near Alston Moor, where the\r\nthree counties of Northumberland, Durham, and Cumberland meet together.\r\nThe lofty hills of the district, bare of wood and almost wholly covered\r\nwith marshy heaths, are intersected by the valleys through which run the\r\nTyne, the Wear, and the Tees, with their numerous branches. The country,\r\nthough little frequented by tourists, is wild and picturesque; but the\r\ndeep gorges with which it is furrowed have more than a mere romantic\r\ninterest, for they lay open to view numerous veins of ore, and direct\r\nthe operations of the miner to the places where it is sufficiently\r\nabundant to reward his toil. The town of Alston, the mining centre of\r\nthe district, is beautifully situated close to the river Tyne, which,\r\nabout five miles above it, ascends, between lofty hills, to the foot of\r\nCross Fell, this picturesque mountain giving a character of considerable\r\ngrandeur to the surrounding scenery. The mines of the Alston Moor\r\ndistrict produce annually about 25,000 tons of lead. The waters are\r\ndrawn off by long adit levels, and the ores are dragged out by horses to\r\nthe day. This region extends southward to the Yorkshire valleys of\r\nSwaledale, Arkendale, and to Grassington, where numerous lead mines are\r\nworked under very similar circumstances. The Yorkshire mines yielded in\r\n1856 8,986 tons of lead.\r\n\r\nAnother important lead district lies in the northern part of Derbyshire,\r\nin the hilly country of the neighbourhood of the Peak, so well known and\r\nso often visited for its picturesque beauty. The mines of Derbyshire,\r\nwhich yield annually 5,000 tons of lead, are getting exhausted; they are\r\nvery numerous, but in general inconsiderable.\r\n\r\nNext to Alston Moor the lead mines of Flintshire and Denbighshire are\r\nthe most productive, furnishing annually nearly 6,000 tons of lead. An\r\nimportant group of veins of lead occurs in the slaty rocks of\r\nCardiganshire and Montgomeryshire, all of which have an E.W. direction;\r\nalthough so far from parallel that they often meet, and frequently form\r\nat such points of intersection ‘courses’ of ore. Some of these mines\r\nwere very profitably worked in the seventeenth century, and during the\r\nlast thirty years several of them have been highly productive.\r\n\r\nThere are considerable lead mines in the south of Scotland, at\r\nWanlockhead and Leadhills in Lanarkshire; and those of Strontian, in\r\nArgyleshire, likewise deserve to be noticed. The Isle of Man has two\r\nimportant lead mines, the Foxdale and Laxey, the former remarkable for\r\nthe great size of its main lode. The elevated tracts of Wicklow likewise\r\ncontain some valuable lead mines, at Luganure and Glenmalure. In 1866\r\nthe total produce of our lead mines amounted to 91,047 tons of galena,\r\nwhich yielded 67,390 tons of metal.\r\n\r\nThe island of Sardinia, already renowned among the ancients for its rich\r\nlead mines, produces about 15,000 tons, or nearly as much as France,\r\nwhere however the extraction of galena has of late years made\r\nconsiderable progress.\r\n\r\nBelgium, which in 1841 produced no more than 34 tons, raised in 1864 no\r\nless than 16,780 tons, chiefly from the mines of Bleyberg-à-Montzen,\r\nsituated in the carboniferous limestone near Verviers. To render these\r\nrich deposits available, vast difficulties had to be surmounted by the\r\nunited powers of enterprise, capital, and engineering skill. Rivers and\r\nbrooks, diverted from their ancient course, were made to flow through\r\nnew water-tight channels, and such is the amount of drainage required in\r\nthat aquiferous region that engines of two thousand horse-power have to\r\nraise from a depth of 360 feet a daily quantity of 800,000 cubic feet of\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nIn Greece the immense mounds of scoriæ accumulated near the ancient\r\nsilver mines of Laurium, have been found to contain about ten per cent.\r\nof lead. Their total mass is estimated at no less than 3,000,000 tons,\r\nand they afford a convincing proof both of the importance of the ancient\r\nsilver production of Attica, and of the imperfection of the old Athenian\r\nmining operations. A French company has lately been formed for smelting\r\nthis prodigious accumulation of scoriæ, once cast aside as rubbish.\r\n\r\nIn Siberia the famous lead mines of Nertschinsk, where many an\r\nunfortunate exile is doomed to end his days, are worked merely for the\r\nsilver contained in them.\r\n\r\nIn South America, the Chilian lead mine of Mina Grande, near Coquimbo,\r\nis renowned for its extreme richness, and Brazil has considerable veins\r\nof galena, in the province of Minas Geraes; but probably the United\r\nStates of North America (Wisconsin, Arkansas, Iowa, Illinois), possess\r\nthe largest galena deposits in the world. In Wisconsin, they extend all\r\nover a vast territory of more than 4,000 square miles. As yet the works\r\nare conducted in the most negligent manner, by a crowd of adventurers.\r\nIn winter, when the air in the pits is more salubrious, and agricultural\r\nlabour ceases, needy farmers, bankrupt traders, and thriftless artisans\r\nflock from all parts to the lead country for the purpose of repairing\r\ntheir broken fortunes. In summer when malaria renders the pits extremely\r\nunhealthy, this nomadic population melts away like chaff before the\r\nwind. Yet, in spite of the rough mode of extraction which prevails in\r\nthe American lead country, the mines of Iowa, Wisconsin, and Illinois\r\nyielded about 20,000 tons of lead in 1866, and their produce is\r\nconstantly increasing.\r\n\r\nIn all lead mines, the galena often occurs in pieces so large that they\r\ndo not require to be separated from the veinstone by the processes of\r\nstamping and washing. They are then called _pure ores_, and the most\r\nsimple preparation is sufficient to prepare them for the smelting\r\nfurnace. When the ore has been picked and so far prepared, it is first\r\nroasted or heated in a reverberatory furnace, an operation which causes\r\nthe oxygen of the air to combine with the two elementary bodies of which\r\ngalena is composed. After undergoing this chemical change, the ore is\r\nnow mixed with coke, charcoal, or peat, and reduced by smelting in a\r\nsmall blast furnace of a peculiar kind. Under the influence of heat, the\r\ncarbon of the coal, uniting with the oxygen of the ore, flies off in the\r\nform of carbonic acid gas, while the metallic lead, which in the finer\r\nores amounts to 70 or 80 per cent., sinks to the bottom of the furnace.\r\nAlmost all the varieties of galena contain a greater or less proportion\r\nof silver, which it is often found worth while to separate from them.\r\nThis process is at present effected according to a most ingenious\r\nmethod, founded on the circumstance first noticed in the year 1829, by\r\nthe late H. L. Pattinson, of Newcastle-on-Tyne, that when lead\r\ncontaining silver is melted in a suitable vessel, afterwards slowly\r\nallowed to cool, and at the same time kept constantly stirred at a\r\ncertain temperature near the melting point of lead, crystals begin to\r\nform. These, as rapidly as they are produced, sink to the bottom, and on\r\nbeing removed are found to contain much less silver than the lead\r\noriginally melted. The still fluid portion, from which the crystals have\r\nbeen removed, will at the same time be proportionally enriched. By\r\nrepeated meltings and crystallisations in a series of cast-iron pots\r\nwith fire-places beneath, the workman is thus able to deprive almost\r\nentirely of its silver by far the largest portion of the lead operated\r\nupon, while the remainder becomes an exceedingly rich alloy of both\r\nmetals, so as to contain fifty times its original proportion of silver.\r\nThis rich lead is subsequently exposed in a refining furnace to a strong\r\nblast of air at a high temperature, fresh supplies of lead being\r\nconstantly introduced as the operation proceeds. By this means the lead\r\nbecomes rapidly oxidized and converted into litharge, which partly runs\r\noff in the fluid state, and is partly (about 10 per cent.) lost by\r\nsublimation, while the silver forms a cake at the bottom of the cupel.\r\nThe brightening of the silver, which lustrously shines forth at the\r\nmoment of the separation of the last traces of lead, indicates the\r\nprecise period at which the operation should be ended, and the blast is\r\nthen turned off and the fire removed from the grate. Before the\r\nintroduction of Pattinson’s ingenious process, the separation of the\r\nsilver from the lead was attended with a much greater loss of the latter\r\nmetal, as greater quantities had to be cupelled to effect the same\r\nresult. The economy obtained amounts to no less than 98 per cent.; for\r\nwhere formerly 100 cwt. of lead were lost by sublimation, the same\r\nquantity of silver is now obtained with a loss of no more than 2 cwt.,\r\nand at the same time with a considerable saving of fuel.\r\n\r\nOres very poor in silver, as for instance those of Alston Moor or\r\nDerbyshire, which formerly could not be profitably cupelled, are now\r\nadvantageously treated by the Pattinson process. This is but one example\r\nof the valuable practical results which may be obtained from a single\r\nscientific discovery. But chemistry has introduced thousands of similar\r\ntechnical improvements in almost all branches of manufacturing industry,\r\nand were we to add together the profits thus obtained, we should find\r\nthat a great part of our wealth is due to the laboratory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXX.\r\n                                MERCURY.\r\n\r\nNot considered as a true Metal by the Ancients—Its Properties and Uses—\r\n  Almaden—Formerly worked by Convicts—Diseases of the Miners—Idria—Its\r\n  Discovery—Conflagration of the Mine—Its Produce—Huancavelica—New\r\n  Almaden.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the metals known to antiquity mercury was the last discovered. It\r\nis mentioned neither in the Bible nor in Homer, who accurately, though\r\nbriefly, describes the characters and uses of all the other ancient\r\nmetals; but we learn from the works of Aristotle that its discovery must\r\nhave preceded the times of Alexander the Great.\r\n\r\nFrom its always remaining fluid in the temperate climates of the earth,\r\nit was, however, not considered as a true metal; for the ancients had no\r\nmeans of ascertaining that at the low temperature of -39° Fahr., it\r\nbecomes malleable and assumes the solid form. The Greeks called it\r\nHydrargyros or _water-silver_, from its fluidity and argentine colour;\r\nthe Romans, ‘argentum vivum,’ or live silver, from which our\r\n‘quicksilver’ has been derived, and in the Middle Ages the alchemists\r\ngave it the planetary name of Mercury, which has been generally adopted\r\nin modern scientific language.\r\n\r\nAt a very early age cinnabar (sulphide of mercury), the beautiful\r\nscarlet ore from which it is chiefly obtained, was employed by the\r\nancients as a colouring material for imparting a florid complexion to\r\ntriumphant generals or to guests at the festive board. The extent to\r\nwhich this cosmetic was used may be inferred from the facts mentioned by\r\nPliny, that the Greeks imported red cinnabar from Almaden 700 years\r\nbefore the Christian era, and that Rome in his time received 700,000\r\npounds from the same mines.\r\n\r\nAs the alchemists considered quicksilver as the fittest substance for\r\ntransmutation into gold, it became the subject of innumerable\r\nexperiments; and though these manipulations had not the desired effect,\r\nthey accidentally led to the discovery of several of its combinations,\r\nwhich soon became known as powerful medicines. But it was reserved for\r\nmodern times to appreciate and understand the full importance of\r\nmercury, and to extend the field of its utility to a variety of uses\r\nunknown to former ages.\r\n\r\nAlloyed with tin-foil, it forms the reflecting surface of looking-\r\nglasses; and by its ready solution of gold and silver, and subsequent\r\ndissipation by a moderate heat, it becomes the great instrument of the\r\narts of gilding and silvering copper and brass. The same property makes\r\nit available in extracting these precious metals from their ores. To\r\nscience it is a substance of paramount value. Its great density, and its\r\nregular rate of extension and contraction by increase and diminution of\r\ntemperature, give it the preference over all liquids for filling\r\nbarometer and thermometer tubes, so that without mercury we should know\r\nbut little indeed about the laws of caloric and of atmospherical\r\npressure. In chemistry it furnishes the only means of collecting and\r\nmanipulating, in the pneumatic trough, such gaseous bodies as are\r\ncondensible over water. To its aid, in this respect, the modern\r\nadvancement of chemical discovery is pre-eminently due, and without its\r\nassistance many a branch of industry which now greatly adds to the\r\nwealth of the nation could never have existed.\r\n\r\nMercury does not rank among those metals which are copiously\r\ndisseminated over the surface of the earth. Considerable deposits or\r\nveins of even its commonest and most abundant ores (red cinnabar;\r\nhepatic cinnabar) are confined to a few spots, and all Europe possesses\r\nbut two important quicksilver mines—at Almaden in Spain, and Idria in\r\nCarniola.\r\n\r\nThe Sierra Morena or the Black Mountains in the Iberian Peninsula, so\r\nwell known as the scene of the exploits of Don Quixote, are no less\r\nrenowned in the mining world for their subterranean riches, among which\r\nthe famous quicksilver mines of Almaden del Azogue hold a conspicuous\r\nrank. This small town of about 10,000 inhabitants is situated on the\r\nnorthern border of the above-mentioned mountain chain, at the south-\r\nwestern extremity of the province of New Castile, and, unlike most other\r\nSpanish cities, affords the pleasing sight of well-built houses and\r\nclean and regular streets. As is generally the case in mining districts,\r\nthe neighbourhood is sterile, but picturesque, and from the neighbouring\r\nmountains magnificent prospects open on every side.\r\n\r\nThe mines of Almaden, after having been the property of the religious\r\nknights of Calatrava, who had assisted in expelling the Moors, were\r\nfarmed off to the Fuggers, the celebrated merchant princes of Augsburg,\r\nwhose descendants still rank among the high aristocracy of Germany.\r\nAfterwards, from the date of 1645 till the present time, they have\r\neither been worked on Government account or farmed off to private\r\ncompanies. A visit to these celebrated mines is highly interesting. A\r\nspacious tunnel or gallery, completely walled with solid masonry, leads\r\ninto the bosom of the mountain and branches out at its extremity into\r\nseveral galleries hewn in the slate which forms the matrix of the vein.\r\nOne of these galleries conducts to the Boveda de Santa Clara, a vast\r\ncircular hall in which formerly stood a horse-gin, for raising the ore\r\nto the surface. At present, however, this work is performed through a\r\nshaft which descends to the lowest level of the mine. From another\r\ngallery convenient stairs lead down to the first working level of the\r\nmine, and thence short ladders to the deeper stories. The shafts are\r\nwide, the galleries high enough to allow one to walk upright through\r\nthem. The upper stories are almost thoroughly dry, the lower ones humid;\r\nthe water, however, is easily removed by hand-pumps, which raise it from\r\nstory to story into a large subterranean reservoir, emptied once a week\r\nby a steam-engine of fifty-four horse-power. The veins are so extremely\r\nrich that, though they have been worked pretty constantly during so many\r\ncenturies, the mines have hardly reached the depth of 1,140 feet. The\r\nlode actually under exploration is from fourteen to sixteen yards thick,\r\nand it becomes thicker still at the crossing of the veins. Its present\r\nannual produce amounts to about 80,000 cwt. of pure mercury. The ore\r\npresents a beautiful sight in the galleries where it is worked, on\r\naccount of the dark red glittering colour of the cinnabar, which is\r\nsometimes earthy and sometimes forms compact crystalline masses, or fine\r\ncrystals mixed with calcareous spar. Often when a hewer detaches a block\r\nof ore with his pickaxe, quicksilver masses of the size of a pigeon’s\r\negg roll from a crevice in which they were lodged, and, leaping along\r\nthe floor, divide into thousands of small drops. This, however, is no\r\nloss, for all the rubbish which accumulates in the galleries is\r\ncarefully collected.\r\n\r\nThe ores are treated in thirteen double distillatory furnaces, called\r\nalodels, and yield only ten per cent. upon an average. But the analysis\r\nof the ores leaves no doubt that the barbarous apparatus employed in its\r\nsublimation causes a loss of nearly one-half of the quicksilver, which\r\nis dispersed in the air, to the great injury of the workmen’s health.\r\nThis apparatus has remained without any material change for the better\r\nsince the days of the Moorish dominion in Spain. The furnaces are heated\r\nwith brushwood, particularly with the resinous branches of the _Cistus\r\nladaniferus_, which grows over the greatest part of the surrounding\r\nmountains. This dark evergreen shrub often extends over many miles of\r\nground, and when in flower covers the hills with a beautiful snow-white\r\ncarpet.\r\n\r\nFormerly only criminals condemned to hard labour for life were employed\r\nto work in the mines of Almaden. At sunrise they were conducted from a\r\nprison, which still exists, through a subterranean passage into the\r\nmines, where they were obliged to toil till evening, when they were led\r\nback again to their dungeons, so that they never saw the light of day.\r\nAfter a few years these poor wretches generally died from inhaling the\r\npoisonous vapours of the mercury. Reduced to despair, they set fire, at\r\nthe beginning of the last century, to the galleries, which were then\r\nconstructed of wood, and thus rendered the mining operations impossible\r\nfor many years. Since then only free miners are employed, who are well\r\npaid, and not allowed to work longer than six hours a day. Most of them,\r\nhowever, die at an early age, between thirty and forty, and those who\r\nlive longer are affected by a spasmodic trembling, so as to be unable to\r\nkeep a limb quiet.\r\n\r\nAfter the mines of Almaden those of Idria in Carniola are the richest in\r\nEurope. This neat little town lies in one of the largest and most\r\npicturesqe basins of the Julian Alps. The gigantic and naked rock walls\r\nwhich inclose the sequestered valley are only partially decked along\r\ntheir summits with clumps of firs; but lower down the slopes are covered\r\nwith beautiful meadows and forests, and here and there on the projecting\r\nspurs of the mountains stand picturesque chapels, which serve to\r\nheighten the beauties of the magnificent panorama.\r\n\r\nChance—to which man owes so much both of good and evil—also led to the\r\ndiscovery of the subterranean treasures of Idria. In the year 1497 a\r\npeasant found, in a tub which he had placed under a brook, some drops of\r\na heavy liquid shining like silver. Although quite ignorant of the value\r\nof his discovery, he still was cunning enough to carry them to a\r\ngoldsmith without mentioning the place where he had found them. At\r\nlength a man named Anderlein, having promised him a handsome reward,\r\nbecame master of the secret, and associating himself with several\r\nwealthy persons, began to work the mine. After several years the\r\nproperty passed into the hands of a company of goldsmiths of Salzburg\r\nand Augsburg, which derived such profits from the mine as to excite the\r\ngreed of the neighbouring Venetians, who in the year 1510 forcibly drove\r\naway the Germans, but were soon after expelled by the Emperor\r\nMaximilian, who, as soon as he heard of this insolent attack, sent some\r\ntroops into the forest of Idria and restored it to its rightful owners.\r\nIn 1578 the mine was incorporated among the domains of the State, and\r\nbegan to be worked with greater regularity.\r\n\r\nThe entrance lies to the south of the town, on the slope of a small hill\r\nprojecting from the circular zone of mountains which gird the basin. The\r\nvisitor may either descend, in less than five minutes, to the bottom of\r\nthe pit, through a perpendicular shaft, in one of the large tubs which\r\nserve to raise the ore, or he may make use of convenient stairs. Here\r\nand there are landing-places, whence galleries lead to the various\r\nfields or stories of the mine, the lowest of which is 145 fathoms under\r\nground. The vein, however, descends much further, to an unknown depth,\r\nand its horizontal extent has likewise not yet been measured.\r\n\r\nAs the limestone in which the ores are imbedded does not form a solid\r\ncompact mass, but is of a loose nature, most of the galleries had, from\r\nthe very beginning of the mining operations, to be artificially propped.\r\nUntil the end of the last century wooden beams were chiefly used for\r\nthis purpose—a construction which frequently gave rise to fearful fires.\r\nThus on March 16, 1803, the workmen saw a thick smoke issuing from\r\nseveral of the deepest galleries. It rose higher and higher, and spread\r\nthrough the upper galleries of the mine. No fire was to be seen, no\r\nsound of flames was to be heard, yet there could be no doubt that the\r\nmine was burning. Some of the workmen boldly undertook to descend to the\r\nscene of the fire, but in vain; they were obliged to flee before their\r\nenemy, for the smoke was not only dense and suffocating, but so\r\nimpregnated with poisonous vapours that no living being could exist\r\nwithin its reach. An attempt was now made to smother the fire by\r\nshutting out the air. All the galleries were blocked as near as possible\r\nto the supposed seat of the fire, as well as the two shafts which led to\r\nthe upper world. The mine remained thus closed during five weeks, but to\r\nno purpose; for when it was reopened, the fire burst forth more\r\nfuriously than before. The flames now howled fearfully from the bottom\r\nof the pit, and the mercurial and sulphurous fumes which rose from it\r\nthreatened instant death to anyone who should be rash enough to approach\r\nthem. The director of the mine now resolved to flood the works as a last\r\nresource against the ravages of fire. A river was turned into the\r\nperpendicular shaft, and ran during two days and three nights into the\r\npit. On the first day there was no perceptible effect, but on the\r\nsecond—whether it were that the vapours produced by the meeting of the\r\nantagonistic elements were striving for an outlet, or that new\r\ninflammable gases had been formed—a most terrific explosion took place,\r\nwhich made the whole mountain tremble as if shaken by an earthquake. The\r\nhuts close to the opening of the shaft were rent to pieces, the stone\r\nhouses at the foot or on the slopes of the hill fell in with a\r\ntremendous crash, and the inhabitants of Idria, fancying the day of\r\njudgment had arrived, fled in terror to the hills.\r\n\r\nIn the mine itself the explosion was afterwards found to have torn up\r\nthe galleries, to have burst the vaulted roofs, and to have hurled away\r\nthe stairs. But the victory was now won. The vapour gradually drew off,\r\nand after a few weeks it was possible once more to descend into the pit.\r\nTwo full years, however, passed before the water was fully pumped out\r\ninto the Idriza, where it poisoned all the fishes, with the exception of\r\nthe eels, who, it seems, are proof against everything except roasting or\r\nboiling. Even after all the water had been removed, it was still found\r\nimpossible to work in the mines, partly from the heat, but chiefly on\r\naccount of the venomous fumes, which soon produced all the symptoms of\r\nmercurial disease.\r\n\r\nIn order to stimulate almost superhuman exertions, an exorbitant salary\r\nwas offered to all those who should venture to explore the most\r\ndangerous passages, and gather the quicksilver, which in some places had\r\ncollected in considerable masses. But many paid for their greed with\r\ntheir lives, and for many months afterwards the air remained so noxious\r\nthat the ordinary mining works could not possibly be carried on. To\r\nprevent similar accidents for the future, and also on account of the\r\nincreasing scarcity of wood, the galleries have since then been walled\r\nwith stone; but when we consider that the whole length of the\r\nsubterranean passages amounts to no less than fifty miles, we cannot\r\nwonder that many of them are still propped with wood, and that as\r\nrecently as 1846 fire raged in the mine, which was again quenched by\r\nputting part of it under water.\r\n\r\nThe stone galleries are vaulted, and of a masterly construction, seven\r\nfeet high and six feet broad. The cost is less than one would suppose,\r\nas the progress of the mining operations furnishes the necessary\r\nmaterials.\r\n\r\nThe temperature in many galleries is equal to that of a conservatory;\r\nand if a floral hall, bathed in light and filled with delicious odours,\r\nis felt to be disagreeably hot, the warmth of the air is naturally far\r\nmore intolerable in dismal excavations, where the workman pursues his\r\nlaborious task by the weak glimmering of a lamp, and in an atmosphere\r\nfull of deadly vapours.\r\n\r\nHere, as in Almaden, a premature old age is the lot of the unhappy\r\nminers, who while young tremble like old men. Yet some attain a\r\ntolerably good old age, and he who reaches his forty-fifth year with\r\ntrembling limbs is said to get accustomed to the effects of the poison,\r\nand may then live, or rather vegetate, till sixty or seventy.\r\n\r\nScarcely any animals live in the mines of Idria. Even spiders cannot\r\nlong resist the noxious atmosphere. Rats, however, formerly existed\r\nthere in considerable numbers, but have almost entirely disappeared\r\nsince the last fire, which proved too much even for them. In some parts\r\nof the mine the mercury is inclosed in the clay-slate in extremely fine\r\nglobules, so as scarcely to be visible to the naked eye; but on removing\r\nthe ore many of them fall out and collect on the floor, in larger drops\r\nor small pools, which are carefully gathered in leather pouches or bags.\r\nBy far the greatest part of the mercury of Idria, however, is combined\r\nwith sulphur, and is obtained by distilling the ore in vast furnaces.\r\n\r\nIt may easily be imagined that the carriage of a liquid body of the\r\nweight of mercury requires the greatest care. The old mode of packing,\r\nstill partly in use, is in sheep-skins, which can acquire the necessary\r\nfirmness only by being tanned with alum, and are attentively examined\r\nbefore being used. After having been filled, the sack is first tried on\r\na wooden table, and, having successfully stood the ordeal of severe\r\npressing and punching, is enclosed in a second skin. Two of these\r\npackages, each containing forty-one pounds and a few ounces, are then\r\nplaced in a small cask, and three of these in a square box. But as, in\r\nspite of all these precautions, the sacks will sometimes burst, the\r\nmercury is now frequently transported in large iron bottles, the\r\nstoppers of which are firmly screwed down by means of a machine invented\r\nfor the purpose. All the quicksilver packed up in this manner is sent to\r\nTrieste, and thence chiefly to England, while that which is destined for\r\nVienna and Germany is exported in sacks.\r\n\r\nIn the years 1856, 1857, and 1858, 4,570, 7,178, and 4,331 hundredweight\r\nof mercury were produced in Idria, and sold at an average price of one\r\nhundred florins. In 1850 mercury was worth two hundred and fifty florins\r\nthe hundredweight, and thus we see how detrimental the competition of\r\nCalifornia has been to the Austrian treasury, which, in its chronic\r\nstate of atrophy, is little able to bear any diminution of revenue.\r\n\r\nA great part of the produce of the mines—about 1,000 hundredweight—is\r\nmanufactured into cinnabar in Idria, which supplies almost all Europe\r\nwith this splendid red colouring matter. All the other European\r\nquicksilver veins, in Tyrol, Bohemia, Hungary, and the Bavarian\r\nPalatinate, are utterly insignificant when compared with Almaden and\r\nIdria, as none of them produce more than a few hundredweight.\r\n\r\nBut even Almaden and Idria have lost much of their former importance\r\nsince the discovery of the rich mines of New Almaden in California,\r\nwhich in 1865 yielded 4,000 hundredweight of mercury. As the uses of\r\nmercury are few, the falling off in price has been the consequence. But\r\nthe greater cheapness of mercury has had a most favourable influence on\r\nthe production of silver in Mexico, Peru, Bolivia, &c., as many of the\r\npoorer ores can now be profitably worked; and thus California, which by\r\nits gold placers threatened to disturb the relative value of the two\r\nprecious metals, has, by promoting at the same time the production of\r\nsilver, largely helped to maintain the former equilibrium and to relieve\r\nthe fears of many political economists.\r\n\r\nIt is a remarkable circumstance that, while Europe has for the last\r\nthree centuries received almost all its silver from America, Mexico and\r\nPeru were all the time dependent upon the old world for the mercury\r\nwithout which Potosi and Guanaxuato would have been comparatively\r\nunproductive. Quicksilver, it is true, had been found here and there,\r\nbut the only mine of importance was that of Huancavelica in Peru, the\r\ndiscovery of which in the year 1567 is attributed to the Indian Gonzalo\r\nNavincopa, though, according to Humboldt, it was already known to the\r\nIncas, who made use of cinnabar to paint their cheeks, as Roman senators\r\nand Athenian archons had done before them. Here, at a height surpassing\r\nthat of the Peak of Teneriffe by 1,500 feet, from 4,000 to 6,000 cwt. of\r\nquicksilver were annually obtained, until the folly of a director ruined\r\nthe chief mine. Ever since 1780 Huancavelica had with difficulty\r\nsupplied the growing wants of the Peruvian silver mines, for at a\r\ngreater depth the ore was found to be mixed with sulphuret of arsenic,\r\nwhich greatly deteriorated its quality. As the lode forms an enormous\r\nmass, strong pillars had been left standing to support the roof, and\r\nthese props the above-mentioned director had the improvident temerity to\r\nremove, in order to increase the produce of the mine. What anyone with a\r\nlittle experience or common-sense might have foreseen, took place. The\r\nrock, deprived of its supports, gave way, the roof fell in with a\r\ntremendous crash, and the mine was ruined—a memorable warning against\r\nthe greed which, snapping at a shadow, loses the substance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXXI.\r\n                            THE NEW METALS.\r\n\r\nZinc—The Ores, but not the Metal, known to the Ancients—Rapid Increase\r\n  of its Production—Chief Zinc-producing Countries—Platinum—Antimony—\r\n  Bismuth—Cobalt and Nickel—Wolfram—Arsenic—Chrome—Manganese—Cadmium—\r\n  Titanium—Molybdenum—Aluminium—Aluminium Bronze—Magnesium—Sodium—\r\n  Palladium—Rhodium—Thallium.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe metals known to the ancients were either such as occur in a native\r\nstate and whose lustre must attract even the attention of the savage, or\r\nsuch as are easily extracted from their ores by the simple agency of\r\nfire and carbon, and consequently require no complicated metallurgic\r\ntreatment. Their number is limited to the seven substances described in\r\nthe preceding chapters; but the art of the modern chemist has greatly\r\nextended our knowledge of metals, and revealed to us the existence of no\r\nless that fifty-six of these elementary bodies.\r\n\r\nSome have been found to lurk under the obscure disguise of alkaline and\r\nearthy matters, such as clay and chalk, magnesia and sand, soda and\r\npotash; others have been discovered in the water of mineral springs, or\r\nunder the brilliant mask of precious stones. Most of these were unknown\r\nbefore the beginning of the present century, nor can there be a doubt\r\nthat future researches will make us acquainted with many metals whose\r\nexistence is still a secret to mankind.\r\n\r\nMost of these new metals are as yet mere objects of curiosity, either\r\nfrom their rarity or the great difficulty and cost of their production;\r\nbut some of them are already of considerable use, and within the last\r\nfifty years zinc has obtained a rank among the most important products\r\nof the mineral world. Calamine, the chief ore which provides us with\r\nthis metal, was indeed known to the ancients, who by smelting it with\r\ncopper ores obtained an alloy similar to our brass;[61] but the metal\r\nitself seems to have been first discovered by the famous alchemist\r\nBombastus Paracelsus, who flourished towards the end of the fifteenth\r\ncentury. Zinc, however, remained unnoticed as a useful metal until the\r\nyear 1805, when Hobson and Sylvester’s discovery that it is malleable at\r\na temperature of 300° F., and can then be worked to any shape with great\r\nfacility, caused it to replace lead for many purposes, in which its\r\nhardness and other valuable qualities render it superior. As it is very\r\neasily extended into thin sheets, and combines the advantages of\r\nlightness, salubrity, and durability, it is frequently used for the\r\nroofing of houses and for the sheathing of ships. Many of our domestic\r\nutensils, particularly those which serve for the holding of liquids, are\r\nnow made of zinc. Large quantities are moulded into architectural\r\nornaments; and the splendid white colour of the oxide of zinc has made\r\nit a triumphant rival of ceruse, or white-lead. To provide for so many\r\nuses, the production of zinc has in a short time made strides without a\r\nparallel in the history of metals. While before 1808 from 150 to 200\r\ntons sufficed for the annual consumption of Europe, more than 110,000\r\ntons are now required, so that in little more than half a century the\r\ndemand has increased more than five hundred times, and a metal\r\npreviously almost unnoticed is now produced in masses worth several\r\nmillions of pounds.\r\n\r\nFootnote 61:\r\n\r\n  A coin of Nero, analysed by Arthur Phillips, was found to consist of\r\n  81·07 per cent. copper, 1·06 tin, and 17·73 zinc; another, of Hadrian,\r\n  of 85·78 copper, 1·19 tin, 1·81 lead, 6·43 zinc, and 0·74 iron.\r\n\r\nThe chief zinc-producing countries of Europe are Prussia and Belgium.\r\nThe Prussian mines, which in 1866 yielded 1,204,419 hundredweight, or\r\nabout 60,000 tons, are situated in Silesia, Westphalia, and the Rhenish\r\nprovinces. In the same year Belgium produced 35,500 tons, chiefly from\r\nthe mines of the Vieille Montagne, near Aix-la-Chapelle, where calamine\r\noccurs in a large mass, imbedded in chalk, and is worked like an open\r\nquarry.\r\n\r\nIn England calamine is, next to galena, the most important ore obtained\r\nfrom the Derbyshire mines, and of late years large quantities of blende\r\nor sulphuret of zinc—an ore which, on account of the special\r\ndifficulties offered by its treatment, had hitherto been neglected—are\r\nlikewise furnished by the Isle of Man, Denbighshire, Flintshire, and\r\nCornwall.\r\n\r\nIn 1864 our entire production of zinc amounted to no more than 4,040\r\ntons; but since that period it has been considerably increased by the\r\nimportation of immense quantities of Sardinian, Swedish, and Spanish\r\nores, which are for the most part reduced in the works of Messrs.\r\nVivian, at Swansea.\r\n\r\nFor many years the United States depended upon Europe for their whole\r\nsupply of zinc; but as nature seems to have denied none of her mineral\r\nriches to the great republic, the discovery of immense deposits of\r\ncalamine and blende in the state of Tennessee has enabled them to\r\ncompete successfully with foreign produce, and the works of Leehigh and\r\nLasalle now furnish a large proportion of the zinc consumed in the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nPlatinum, the heaviest body in nature, was first discovered by the\r\nSpaniards, in the gold mines of Darien, probably in the first half of\r\nthe sixteenth century;[62] but as it remained infusible in the strongest\r\nheat, and no method was known for purifying its ore, in which it is\r\nremarkably combined with six or even seven other metals, it continued\r\nfor a long time to be a mere object of curiosity. In 1772 Count\r\nSickingen discovered that it can be welded like iron when urged to a\r\nwhite heat, and first succeeded in producing platinum wire and platinum\r\nleaves. A few years after the celebrated Swedish chemist, Bergmann,\r\nisolated it from the metallic substances associated with its ore, and\r\nproved it to be a peculiar metal.\r\n\r\nFootnote 62:\r\n\r\n  Kopp, ‘Geschichte der Chemie,’ vol. iv. p.221.\r\n\r\nPlatinum is found in almost all the auriferous districts of the globe,\r\nbut generally in such small quantities as not to be worth the\r\ncollecting. Kuschwa Goroblagodat and Nishne-Tagilsk, in the Ural,\r\nfurnish annually about eight hundred hundredweight, which is nearly ten\r\ntimes the amount from Brazil, Columbia, St. Domingo, and Borneo. But, in\r\nspite of this scanty production, its discovery must be considered as one\r\nof the most important conquests which science has made in the material\r\nworld, as its perfect infusibility, its hardness, its unalterability by\r\nair and water, and its property of withstanding the action of the most\r\ncorrosive simple acids, render it an invaluable material for the\r\nfabrication of various chemical vessels, without whose assistance many\r\nimportant discoveries could not possibly have been made. To the\r\nmanufacturers of sulphuric acid large retorts of platinum are\r\nindispensable for concentrating this highly corrosive fluid, which\r\ndevours every other metallic vase with which it comes in contact. The\r\nprice of platinum is intermediate between that of gold and silver.\r\n\r\nThe ores of Antimony played a great part in the labours of the\r\nalchemists, but the metal is first mentioned in the works of Basilius\r\nValentinus, who flourished during the second half of the fifteenth\r\ncentury. It is used chiefly in several important alloys. Combined with\r\nlead it constitutes type-metal, and united with lead and tin it is\r\nemployed for making Britannia metal, and the plates on which music is\r\nengraved. Nearly all the antimony of commerce is furnished by the grey\r\nsulphuret (stibnite), which occurs in Hungary, Saxony, South America,\r\nand Australia. Though Cornwall produces a considerable quantity of\r\nantimonial ore, our chief supply is derived from Singapore, the emporium\r\nof the various mines of Borneo and other parts of the Malayan\r\nArchipelago.\r\n\r\nThe grey antimony ore was employed by the ancients for colouring the\r\nhair and the eyebrows, and for staining the upper and under edges of the\r\neyelids—a practice still in use among Oriental nations for the purpose\r\nof increasing the apparent size of the eye. According to Dioscorides, it\r\nwas prepared for this purpose by inclosing it in a lump of dough, and\r\nthen burning it in the coals till it was reduced to a cinder. It was\r\nthen extinguished with milk and wine, and again placed upon coals and\r\nblown until it was ignited, after which the heat was discontinued, lest,\r\nas Pliny says, ‘_plumbum fiat_’—it become lead. It hence appears that\r\nthe metal antimony was occasionally seen by the ancients, though not\r\ndistinguished from lead.\r\n\r\nBismuth, a metal of a dull silver-white colour, inclining to red, is\r\nfirst mentioned in the writings of the alchemists of the Middle Ages. It\r\nis almost exclusively furnished by the mines of Schneeberg in Saxony,\r\nwhere it is generally found in a native state. On account of its great\r\nfusibility and brittleness it is seldom used alone; but associated with\r\nother metals it forms several valuable alloys.\r\n\r\nIn the Middle Ages the Saxon and Bohemian miners believed all those ores\r\nfrom which, in spite of their promising appearance, they were unable to\r\nextract a useful metal, to be a work of the gnomes mocking the industry\r\nof man. Some of these ores they called Kobold—an opprobrious name given\r\nto these evil subterranean spirits, who were supposed to be of dwarfish\r\nstature and intense ugliness; others Nickel—a name probably of the same\r\nmeaning as our old Nick. The progress of metallurgic industry has fully\r\nexculpated the gnomes of all evil intentions, for the last century\r\nsucceeded in extracting the metals Cobalt and Nickel from those\r\nrebellious ores. Cobalt, though as yet but rarely employed, gives\r\npromise of some future importance, as it appears to be extremely\r\ntenacious. A wire made of pure cobalt will carry nearly double the\r\nweight that an iron wire of the same thickness will do.\r\n\r\nThe cobalt ores, which impart a magnificent blue colour to glass, have\r\nlost much of their importance as pigments since the discovery of\r\nartificial ultramarine, while the nickel ores which usually accompany\r\nthem, and were formerly thrown away as rubbish, have become valuable,\r\nsince the metal which they contain has found some important uses. The\r\nsmall coin of Belgium and Switzerland is now made of nickel instead of\r\ncopper, and large quantities are employed in the fabrication of German\r\nsilver, or Argentine plate, an alloy of copper, nickel, and zinc, which,\r\nfrom its hardness and brilliant white colour, furnishes an excellent\r\nmaterial for tablespoons and forks. Both the nickel and cobalt ores are\r\nproduced chiefly by Sweden, Norway, and Germany; our own mines furnish\r\nbut insignificant quantities. In the United States the Camden works (New\r\nJersey) now produce nickel at the rate of 150,000 pounds a year.\r\n\r\nTungsten, a metal discovered in 1783 by two Spanish chemists, the\r\nbrothers Juan and Fausto d’Elhujar, in a black mineral called wolfram,\r\nwhich frequently occurs along with tin ores in Cornwall (where it is\r\nknown under the names of cal, or callen, and gossan), Saxony, Austria,\r\n&c., is in its isolated state a mere object of scientific curiosity, but\r\nwhen melted with cast steel or even with iron only, in the proportion of\r\nfrom two to five per cent., it produces a steel which is very hard and\r\nfine-grained, and for tenacity and density is superior to any other\r\nsteel made. Hence wolfram-steel, which is now coming extensively into\r\nuse in Germany, makes the best knives and razors; but, unfortunately,\r\nthe rarity and high price of wolfram confine its production within\r\nnarrow limits. Several of the tungstates, or salts of tungsten, are used\r\nas pigments; and the tungstate of soda has the highly valuable property\r\nof rendering fabrics uninflammable, and thus furnishes a means for\r\npreventing the accidents which constantly occur from the burning of\r\nladies’ dresses.\r\n\r\nAlbert the Great, a famous alchemist of the thirteenth century, is\r\nsupposed to have been the discoverer of Arsenic, a tin-white metal,\r\nwhich, however, soon loses its brilliancy when exposed to the air, and\r\nturns black. From its poisonous qualities it is only used in some\r\nunimportant alloys which serve for the manufacture of insignificant\r\narticles, such as buttons or buckles. Some of its ores and combinations,\r\nwhich, from their lively yellow, green, and red colour, would otherwise\r\nhave been valuable pigments, are likewise for the same reason seldom\r\nused. A great number of copper, nickel, lead, cobalt, zinc, and iron\r\nores contain some arsenic; but this dangerous substance is obtained\r\nchiefly from the common arsenical pyrites (Mispickel—sulphuret of iron\r\nand arsenic), which occurs in Cornwall and Devonshire. The whole supply\r\nof arsenical ores amounted in 1866 to about 2,610 tons, of which England\r\nand Prussia furnished the greater part.\r\n\r\nThe metal Uranium, discovered in 1789 by the celebrated Klaproth, in a\r\nblack heavy mineral, called Pechblende (pitch-blende), occurring in the\r\nmines of the Erzgebirge, is not used as such, but is very valuable in\r\nporcelain-painting, as it affords a beautiful orange colour in the\r\nenamelling fire, and a black colour in that in which the porcelain is\r\nbaked. A laboratory has been opened at Joachimsthal, where the ore is\r\nconverted into uranate of soda for this purpose.\r\n\r\nChrome, like cobalt, is used chiefly as a pigment. Several of its salts\r\nare splendid yellow colouring matters, and its oxide imparts the finest\r\ngreen tints to porcelain. The metal itself, which was discovered by\r\nVauquelin in 1797, is, as yet, an object of interest only to the\r\nchemist, but may one day become important, as in its pure state it is\r\nvery hard, unalterable by air and water, and even less fusible than\r\nplatina. Most of its ores belong to the rarer minerals, and but one,\r\nchrome-iron, occurs in sufficient abundance for industrial purposes. It\r\nis found in Hungary, in Norway (which annually exports about 16,000 tons\r\nto Hamburg and Holland), in Siberia, and in large quantities in Maryland\r\nand Pennsylvania. The ore employed in England is obtained mostly from\r\nBaltimore, Drontheim, and the Shetland Isles, and amounts to about 2,000\r\ntons annually.\r\n\r\nManganese is likewise a metal which has not yet left the domain of the\r\nlaboratory, but some of its ores are of considerable and increasing\r\nimportance. The grey and black oxides of manganese are largely used for\r\nthe manufacture of the chloride of lime, a substance well known for its\r\nbleaching properties. They also serve in the fabrication of flint-glass,\r\nas a means for correcting the green tinge which it is apt to derive from\r\niron, and are employed in the manufacture of various kinds of steel. The\r\nores of manganese are chiefly provided by the mines of Nassau, which in\r\n1864 yielded 14,460 tons, and of Huelva in Spain, which furnished 24,430\r\ntons in 1865. Our Cornish mines likewise produce considerable\r\nquantities, but are still far from being able to supply the wants of our\r\ncolossal industry, which, in 1866, required the importation of no less\r\nthan 48,700 tons of oxide of manganese from foreign countries.\r\n\r\nCadmium, which accompanies most of the zinc ores, was discovered by\r\nStromeyer in 1818. Its sulphuret affords a fine yellow pigment; but the\r\nmetal itself, which has the colour and lustre of tin, and is very\r\nfusible and ductile, has no commercial value.\r\n\r\nRutile, a red-brown mineral, occurring in small quantities in the Alps,\r\nNorway, and many other localities, where it is generally found in\r\ncrystals, imbedded in quartz, was found by Klaproth, in 1795, to be the\r\noxide of a peculiar metal which, according to the old fashion of giving\r\nmythological names to new planets and metals, obtained the name of\r\nTitanium. The metal, which has a copper-red colour, has not hitherto\r\nbeen applied to use; but rutile is employed as a yellow colour in\r\npainting porcelain, and also for giving the requisite tint to artificial\r\nteeth.\r\n\r\nLike Titanium, the metal Molybdenum, discovered by Hjelm in 1782, is as\r\nyet interesting only in a scientific point of view; but one of its salts\r\nis used by the cotton-printers as a valuable colouring matter, and\r\nanother is indispensable as a re-agent in many chemical researches. Thus\r\nmore than one of the modern metals has already become an important\r\nobject to the porcelain-painter or the dyer.\r\n\r\nAluminium, the metal which Sir H. Davy discovered in clay or alumina,\r\nand of which the purest native oxides are the varieties of corundum\r\n(oriental ruby, sapphire, &c.), has of late become of technical\r\nimportance, and though the cost of its production is very great, as a\r\npound of aluminium is worth about 4_l._, yet it already serves for many\r\npurposes. Its silvery lustre and perfect unalterability by atmospherical\r\ninfluences render it an excellent material for objects of art and\r\nornament, and from its low specific gravity (2-56⁄100) it makes\r\nexcellent tubes for telescopes and opera-glasses, which when composed of\r\nany other metal are of a fatiguing weight. Even culinary vases have\r\nalready been made of aluminium, for, besides its perfect innocuousness,\r\nit cools very slowly when heated, and greasy substances do not adhere to\r\nit. Its high price is the only obstacle which has hitherto limited its\r\nuses. With copper it forms an alloy (aluminium-bronze) discovered by Dr.\r\nJohn Percy, which possesses the hardness, tenacity, and malleability of\r\niron without its liability to rust, and consequently has already found\r\nnumerous applications. The beautiful gold colour of this alloy makes it\r\na valuable material for the fabrication of the vases and ornaments used\r\nin Catholic churches, and a recent decree of the Pope has authorised its\r\nemployment for this purpose.\r\n\r\nMagnesium, the metallic basis of magnesia, a native earth widely\r\ndisseminated in the mineral kingdom, and forming a constituent part of\r\nwhole mountain chains, had ever since its discovery by Sir Humphry Davy\r\nbeen a mere object of curiosity, when a few years ago, Mr. Sonstadt, an\r\nEnglish chemist, succeeded in producing it in larger quantities. Its\r\nsilvery brilliancy, hardness, and ductility, its low specific gravity,\r\nand unalterability by air and water, are qualities which will probably\r\nlead to an extensive employment when a cheaper method of production\r\nshall have been discovered; but even now it has found a highly\r\ninteresting use. It is so easily inflammable that a wire of considerable\r\nthickness can be ignited in the flame of a candle, and the light evolved\r\nby the combustion is of almost solar intensity. In lighthouses it serves\r\nto guide the mariner in his course; it lights up the obscurest recesses\r\nof stalactital caverns, and with its assistance the photographer no\r\nlonger depends upon the sun, and reveals to us the hidden paintings and\r\nsculptures of rock-tombs and temples as distinctly as if they were\r\nexposed to the light of day.\r\n\r\nSodium, the metallic basis of soda, was discovered by Sir Humphry Davy\r\nin 1807. It is lighter than water, and white and lustrous as silver; but\r\nexposure to air almost immediately converts it into soda. Thus it can\r\nnever become directly useful, like aluminium or magnesium; but being\r\nindispensable for reducing the ores of these two metals, it renders\r\nimportant indirect services, and is consequently produced in\r\nconsiderable quantities.\r\n\r\nPalladium, one of the hardest and heaviest of metals, is of a steel grey\r\ncolour, passing into silver white. Its alloy with silver, which has the\r\nvaluable property of not tarnishing in air, is eminently fitted for the\r\nmanufacture of delicate scientific instruments. The Wollaston medal,\r\ngiven by the Geological Society, is, in honour of its discoverer, made\r\nof palladium, which is considerably dearer than gold.\r\n\r\nIn 1804, the same eminent philosopher discovered another metal in native\r\nplatina, to which he gave the name of Rhodium. Mixed with steel in the\r\nproportion of one to fifty, rhodium produces an excellent metal for\r\nmaking the sharpest cutting instruments, and a mixture of equal parts of\r\nrhodium and steel makes the best telescopic mirrors, as it is not liable\r\nto be tarnished. It is also employed for making the unalterable nibs of\r\nthe so-called rhodium pens.\r\n\r\nThallium, though one of the newest metals, as it was discovered by Mr.\r\nCrookes as recently as 1861, already bids fair to render some important\r\nservices. It imparts to optical glasses a considerable density and\r\ndispersive power, and should no other use be found for it, this alone\r\nwould render it a valuable acquisition.\r\n\r\nSuch is the brief history of those new metals which have already found a\r\nuseful employment in the industrial arts. It throws a vivid light upon\r\nthe rapid progress of modern chemistry, for the very existence of most\r\nof them was undreamt of at the beginning of the present century, and\r\ntheir discovery could be attained only by an amount of analytical\r\nknowledge beyond the scope of any previous age. On witnessing these\r\ntriumphs of science we may well ask where they will end, and when the\r\ngoal will be reached beyond which it will be impossible for the human\r\nintellect to penetrate?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXXII.\r\n                                 COAL.\r\n\r\nThe Age of Coal—Plants of the Carboniferous Age—Hugh Miller’s\r\n  Description of a Coal Forest—Vast Time required for the Formation of\r\n  the Coal-fields—Derangements and Dislocations—Faults—Their\r\n  Disadvantages and Advantages—Bituminous Coals—Anthracites—Our Black\r\n  Diamonds—Advantageous Position of our Coal Mines—The South Welsh Coal-\r\n  field—Great Central and Manchester Coal-fields—The Whitehaven Basin\r\n  and the Dudley Area—Newcastle and Durham Coal-fields—Costly Winnings—A\r\n  Ball in a Coal-pit—Submarine Coal Mines—Newcastle View from Tynemouth\r\n  Priory—Hewers—Cutting Machines—Putters—Onsetters— Shifters—Trapper\r\n  Boys—George Stephenson—Rise of Coal Production—Probable Duration of\r\n  our Supply—Prussian Coal Mines—Belgian—Coal Mines in various other\r\n  countries—Maunch Chunck.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe history of the primitive races of mankind, as far as we are able to\r\ntrace it in the few relics that have survived their existence, shows us\r\nthat an age of stone was followed by one of bronze, which in its turn\r\nwas succeeded by one of iron. The Golden Age has probably never existed\r\nbut in the fancy of poets who sought in the land of dreams a\r\ncompensation for the deficiencies of the real world; and there can be no\r\ndoubt that, despite California and Australia, our own times are as far\r\nfrom realising the pleasing vision as any before them.\r\n\r\nBut a title to which they have a better claim is founded upon the vast\r\nuse of the mineral fuel without which the glorious inventions of Watt\r\nand Stephenson would have been comparatively vain; and whoever has\r\nattentively examined the foundations of our industry, our commerce, our\r\nwealth, and our civilisation will hardly deny that we live in what may\r\njustly be termed the Age of Coal.\r\n\r\nThis mineral, the importance of which in the political economy of the\r\nleading nations of the globe can hardly be overrated, is also one of\r\nsurpassing interest in a geological point of view, for the history of\r\nits formation is one of the great marvels of the subterranean world.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PECOPTERIS ADIANTOIDES.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SPHENOPTERIS AFFINIS.]\r\n\r\nThe plants whose growth and decay originally furnished the materials of\r\nwhich our black coal[63] is composed, flourished in that far distant\r\nperiod when as yet no bird or mammalian quadruped had made its\r\nappearance, when even the gigantic Ichthyosaurus was not yet born, and\r\nthe progress of organic life had not advanced beyond the creation of\r\nsome uncouth reptiles or strangely formed fishes. From the vast space of\r\ntime which separates us from the carboniferous age, it may easily be\r\nimagined that the state of the vegetable world was then extremely\r\ndifferent from that now prevailing. The vegetable remains which\r\nconstitute coal have generally been so transformed as to afford no trace\r\nof their original texture; yet the distinct plants found here and there\r\npreserved in the mass, and which amount to about five hundred species,\r\nplainly bear the character of a swampy vegetation, and show that they\r\nmust have grown in submerged, or at least extremely humid, situations.\r\nThey consist chiefly of ferns, of Lepidodendra, allied to the club-\r\nmosses of the present day, of a few coniferous trees, the woody\r\nstructure of some of them showing that they were related to the\r\nAraucarian division of pines, more than to any of our common European\r\nfirs; of some large ‘horsetails,’ and of Sigillariæ and Calamites, that\r\nseem to have been distinct from all tribes of now existing plants.\r\nScanty as are these relics of an extinct world, they yet allow the fancy\r\nto reconstruct the forests of which they formed a part, and to wander\r\nthrough those dismal woods where generations after generations of\r\narborescent ferns and moor-plants flourished and decayed for the use of\r\nbeings that were to appear millions of years later upon the stage of\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nFootnote 63:\r\n\r\n  Lignite, or brown coal, is of more modern origin.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LEPIDODENDRON ELEGANS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ASTEROPHYLLITES COMOSA.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SIGILLARIA OCULATA.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CALAMITES NODOSUS.]\r\n\r\nThe following description by Hugh Miller will assist our fancy in\r\nroaming among the primeval thickets from which coal was formed: ‘We have\r\nbefore us a low shore, covered with a dense vegetation. Huge trees of\r\nwonderful form stand out far into the water. There seems no intervening\r\nbeach. A thick hedge of reeds, tall as the masts of pinnaces, runs along\r\nthe deeper bays, like water-flags at the edge of a lake. A river of vast\r\nvolume comes rolling from the interior, darkening the water for leagues\r\nwith its slime and mud, and bearing with it to the open sea reeds and\r\nferns and cones of the pine, and immense floats of leaves, and now and\r\nthen some bulky tree undermined and uprooted by the current. We near the\r\ncoast, and now enter the opening of the stream. A scarce penetrable\r\nphalanx of reeds, that attain to the height and wellnigh to the bulk of\r\nforest trees, is ranged on either hand. The bright and glossy stems seem\r\nrodded like Gothic columns; the pointed leaves stand out green at every\r\njoint, tier above tier, each tier resembling a coronal wreath, or an\r\nancient crown with the rays turned outwards, and we see atop what may be\r\neither large spikes or catkins. What strange forms of vegetable life\r\nappear in the forest behind! Can that be a club-moss that raises its\r\nslender height for more than fifty feet from the soil? Or can these tall\r\npalm-like trees be actually ferns, and these spreading branches mere\r\nfronds? And then these gigantic reeds! are they not mere varieties of\r\nthe common horsetail of our bogs and marshes, magnified some sixty or a\r\nhundred times? Have we arrived at some such country as the continent\r\nvisited by Gulliver, in which he found thickets of weeds and grass tall\r\nas woods of twenty years’ growth, and lost himself amid a forest of corn\r\nfifty feet in height? The lesser vegetation of our own country, its\r\nreeds, mosses, and ferns, seems here as if viewed through a microscope,\r\nthe dwarfs have sprung up into giants, and yet there appears to be no\r\nproportional increase in size among what are unequivocally its trees.\r\nYonder is a group of what seem to be pines—tall and bulky, ’tis true,\r\nbut neither taller nor bulkier than the pines of Norway and America.\r\nThere is an amazing luxuriance of growth all around us. Scarce can the\r\ncurrent make way through the thickets of aquatic plants that rise thick\r\nfrom the muddy bottom; and though the sunshine falls bright on the upper\r\nboughs of the tangled forest beyond, not a ray penetrates the more than\r\ntwilight gloom that broods over the marshy platform below. The rank\r\nsteam of decaying vegetation forms a thick blue haze, that partially\r\nobscures the underwood. Deadly lakes of carbonic acid gas have\r\naccumulated in the hollows; there is a silence all around, uninterrupted\r\nsave by the sudden splash of some reptile fish that has risen to the\r\nsurface in pursuit of its prey, or when a sudden breeze stirs the hot\r\nair, and shakes the fronds of the giant ferns, or the catkins of the\r\nreeds. The wide continent before us is a continent devoid of animal\r\nlife, save that its pools and rivers abound in fish and mollusca, and\r\nthat millions and tens of millions of the infusory tribes swarm in the\r\nbogs and marshes. Here and there, too, an insect of strange form\r\nflutters among the leaves. It is more than probable that no creature\r\nfurnished with lungs of the more perfect construction could have\r\nbreathed the atmosphere of this early period and have lived.’\r\n\r\nAs coal seams have been discovered as far to the north as Greenland,\r\nMelville Island, and Spitzbergen, where now no trees will grow, it has\r\nbeen inferred that, in the primeval ages which witnessed their birth, a\r\ntropical climate must have reigned over the whole surface of the earth;\r\nbut the vegetation of arborescent ferns does not necessarily imply a\r\nvery warm climate, as such plants are found to flourish in New Zealand,\r\ntogether with many conifers and club-mosses, so that a forest in that\r\ntemperate country may make a nearer approach to the carboniferous\r\nvegetation than any other now existing on the globe. So much is certain,\r\nthat a very different distribution of sea and land must in those times\r\nhave mitigated the severity of the Arctic winter, or, perhaps, as\r\nProfessor Oswald Heer conjectures, our solar system may then have rolled\r\nthrough a space more densely clustered with stars, whose radiant heat\r\ngave to our earth the advantage of a mild climate, even at the poles.\r\n\r\nThe space of time required for the formation of the coal-fields is as\r\nimmeasurable as the distance that separates us from Sirius. We know by\r\nexperience how thin the sheet of humus is which the annual leaf-fall of\r\nour trees, or the yearly decay of our moor-plants, leaves behind, and\r\nhow many decenniums must elapse before one single inch of solid mould is\r\nformed. But there are many coal strata eight, ten, or even forty or\r\nfifty feet thick; and if we consider besides the mighty pressure of the\r\nsuperincumbent rocks which store them in the smallest compass, we cannot\r\npossibly doubt that _one_ such stratum must have required thousands of\r\nyears for its formation. Our wonder increases when we reflect that in\r\nmany _coal-measures_ (the series of beds intimately associated with the\r\nseams of coal) no less than a hundred thick and thin seams of coal\r\nalternate with layers of sandstone and shale, so that the reckoning\r\nwould swell to millions were we able to fathom the ages of their\r\nsuccessive growth.\r\n\r\nIt may well be asked how such vast masses of vegetable origin, which\r\nrequired the sun’s light for their formation, came thus to be incased in\r\nstone thousands of feet beneath the surface of the earth? More than one\r\ntheory has been advanced to solve this difficult problem, which can\r\nhardly be explained in any other manner than by a general, slowly\r\nprogressing subsidence of the humid lowlands, alternating with periods\r\nof rest. Fancy a wide delta land, similar to Egypt or the Netherlands,\r\ncovered with luxuriant forests, whose spoils, accumulating where they\r\nfall, form in the course of centuries a thick stratum of vegetable\r\nmatter. This land then sinks, suddenly or gradually, under water, many a\r\nfathom deep, and remains there perhaps for ten thousand years, till a\r\nvast deposit is formed of sandstone and shale, brought down from the\r\nhighlands by the rivers that come rolling from the interior, the\r\npressure of which, aided by water, converts the stratum of wood into\r\ncoal. By this deposit the bottom is gradually filled up, and the bay\r\nagain converted into marsh or meadow, upon which again vegetation\r\nflourishes for a thousand years till the materials of a second bed of\r\ncoal are collected. A third submergence takes place, rocky strata are\r\nagain deposited, the water again shoals into land capable of bearing\r\nplants, a third period of forests commences, and continues till the mass\r\nof vegetable matter destined to form a new bed of coal is accumulated.\r\nIt is unnecessary to pursue the series any further; let it suffice to\r\nsay that in this manner coal followed upon sand, or sand upon coal, till\r\nin the carboniferous basin of Nova Scotia, for instance, a vertical\r\nsubsidence of three miles was gradually filled up by the waste swept\r\ndown from the higher lands, or by the accumulation of vegetable matter.\r\n\r\nGreat as are these changes of level, they do not indicate any more\r\nconsiderable or violent perturbations than those which take place at the\r\npresent day, either from earthquakes or from slow oscillations of the\r\nsoil. Large areas in the Pacific and elsewhere are known to be actually\r\nsubsiding at the rate of three or four feet in the century, and when\r\nmeasured on the scale of geological time, the depression which sunk the\r\nfirst carboniferous forests of South Wales or Nova Scotia to the depth\r\nof ten or twenty thousand feet, probably proceeded at the same slow\r\nrate. Adding to these vast epochs of gradual subsidence the long periods\r\nof rest which intervened between them, it is perhaps no exaggeration to\r\naffirm that several millions of years may have been required for the\r\nformation of a coal-field such as that of Saarbrücken or South Wales.\r\nThe fossil remains inclosed in the various layers of the carboniferous\r\nbeds alone suffice to prove the immensity of time required for their\r\naccumulation, for the species of ferns or lycopods imbedded in the lower\r\nseams of a coal-field are found gradually to disappear in the higher\r\nones, while new species are continually appearing on rising in the\r\nseries, until, finally, the plants of the older seams have completely\r\nmade way for newer forms. Thus the coal formation has, during the vast\r\nages of its growth, changed more than once the aspect of its flora, and\r\nthe plants which flourished in its youth had long since disappeared from\r\nthe earth when it approached its end.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  COAL-BEDS RENDERED AVAILABLE BY ELEVATION.\r\n  _a_ _b_ _c_, shafts. A B C, coal-beds.\r\n]\r\n\r\nAlthough all coal-fields must have originally been formed in horizontal\r\nor slightly undulating situations, yet in many cases they have undergone\r\nenormous derangements or dislocations from subsequent terrestrial\r\nchanges; and to this circumstance is mainly due their utility to man.\r\nHad they been permitted to remain in their primitive _geological_\r\nposition, we probably should never have enjoyed the benefit of the coal,\r\nbecause it would have been too deep for our reach. We might have known\r\nit to be there, but it would have been beyond our power to pierce a mile\r\nor two into the earth. But, by a wonderful and merciful providence, the\r\noscillations to which the earth-rind is subject, have frequently\r\nupheaved them enormously out of their original positions; and the\r\nelevated portions having often been denuded by water, large patches of\r\ncoal have thus been rendered available to man.\r\n\r\nThe various subterranean changes which have acted upon the coal-fields\r\nduring the course of unnumbered ages have not only raised or sunk, but\r\nfrequently dislocated, contorted, ruptured, or broken them up in a most\r\nextraordinary manner. In the coal-field near Mons, in Belgium, for\r\ninstance, a vast lateral pressure has curved the strata again and again,\r\nand even folded them four or five times into zigzag bendings, so that on\r\nsinking a shaft the same continuous layer of coal is cut through several\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SECTION OF COAL-FIELD SOUTH OF MALMESBURY.]\r\n\r\n1.

Great oolite.\r\n10. Corn brash and\r\nforest marl.\r\n\r\nFrequently a concave form has been the result of these terrestrial\r\nrevolutions, and hence coal-fields are often called coal-basins. Thus,\r\nin the coal-field south of Malmesbury, the strata appear to dip from the\r\nsurface, and rise again to it after attaining a certain depth, so that a\r\nsection of them suggests the idea of a boat or basin.\r\n\r\nVery commonly one portion of a continuous stratum or series of strata\r\nhas been broken away from the rest, and has been displaced, either by\r\nelevation or depression, or shifting on one side, for various distances.\r\nThe amount of displacement is sometimes only a few inches, and at other\r\ntimes several hundred fathoms, and the extent may be twenty yards or\r\ntwenty miles.\r\n\r\nWe may easily conceive the difficulties which these disruptions\r\nfrequently throw in the way of the miner, who in following what he\r\nconsiders a valuable seam of coal is suddenly stopped by coming in\r\ncontact with a fault, a trouble, or a slip, as these phenomena are\r\nexpressively called, and finds the coal shifted several yards above or\r\nbelow, or even completely lost. On the other hand, the miner, thus\r\nprovokingly stopped in his labours, must not forget that it is perhaps\r\nowing to the very shifts he complains of that the outcrop of the coal\r\nhas occurred at all in his neighbourhood, and that the coal is workable\r\nthroughout a very large portion of the district in which he is\r\ninterested.\r\n\r\nA most important advantage is also derived from the existence of these\r\nnumerous faults in coal strata; namely, that they intersect a large\r\nfield of coal in all directions, and by the clayey contents which fill\r\nup the cracks accompanying minor faults, they become natural coffer-\r\ndams, which prevent the body of water accumulated in one part of the\r\nfield from flowing into any opening which might be made in it in another\r\npart. A remarkable instance of the advantage arising from the presence\r\nof a great line of fault occurred in the year 1825 at Gosforth, near\r\nNewcastle, where a shaft was dug on the wet side of what is locally\r\ntermed the Great Ninety Fathom Dyke, which there intersects the coal-\r\nfield. The workings were immediately inundated with water, and it was\r\nfound necessary to abandon them. Another shaft, however, was sunk on the\r\nother side of the dyke, only a few yards from the former, and in this\r\nthey descended nearly 200 fathoms, or 1,200 feet, without any hindrance\r\nfrom the water.\r\n\r\nThe separation of a coal-field into small areas by dykes or faults is\r\nlikewise very beneficial in case of fire in a coal-pit, for in this case\r\nthe combustion is prevented from spreading widely, and destroying, as it\r\notherwise would, the whole of the ignited seam.\r\n\r\n‘The natural disposition of coal in detached portions,’ says the author\r\nof an excellent article in the _Edinburgh Review_,[64] ‘is not simply a\r\nphenomenon of geology, but it also bears upon national considerations.\r\nIt is remarkable that this natural disposition is that which renders the\r\nfuel most accessible and most easily mined. Were the coal situated at\r\nits normal geological depth, that is, supposing the strata to be all\r\nhorizontal and undisturbed or upheaved (_sic_), it would be far below\r\nhuman reach. Were it deposited continuously in one even superficial\r\nlayer, it would have been too readily, and therefore too quickly mined,\r\nand all the superior qualities would be wrought out, and only the\r\ninferior left; but as it now lies, it is broken up by geological\r\ndisturbances into separate portions, each defined and limited in area,\r\neach sufficiently accessible to bring it within man’s reach and labour,\r\neach manageable by mechanical arrangements, and each capable of gradual\r\nexcavation without being subject to sudden exhaustion. Selfish\r\nplundering is partly prevented by natural barriers, and we are warned\r\nagainst reckless waste by the comparative thinness of coal-seams, as\r\nwell as by the ever-augmenting difficulty of working them at increased\r\ndepths. By the separation of seams one from another, and by varied\r\nintervals of waste sandstones and shales, such a measured rate of mining\r\nis necessitated as precludes us from entirely robbing posterity of the\r\nmost valuable mineral fuel, while the fuel itself is preserved from\r\nthose extended fractures and crumblings and falls which would certainly\r\nbe the consequence of largely mining the best bituminous coal, were it\r\naggregated into one vast mass. In fact, by an evident exercise of\r\nforethought and benevolence in the Great Author of all our blessings,\r\nour invaluable fuel has been stored up for us in deposits the most\r\ncompendious, the most accessible, yet the least exhaustible, and has\r\nbeen locally distributed into the most convenient situations. Our coal-\r\nfields are, in fact, so many _bituminous banks_, in which there is\r\nabundance for an adequate currency, but against any sudden run upon them\r\nnature has interposed numerous checks, by locking up whole reserves of\r\nthe precious fuel in the bank cellar, under the invincible protection of\r\nponderous stone-beds.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 64:\r\n\r\n  Vol. cxi. p. 80.\r\n\r\nIf we examine the nature of the mineral fuel thus provided for us in the\r\nbowels of the earth, we find a number of varieties greatly differing\r\nfrom each other in chemical composition and in combustible value. Thus\r\nthe _anthracites_ or _non-bituminous coals_, which contain from eighty-\r\nfive to ninety-seven per cent. of pure carbon, are not easily ignited,\r\nand yield no flame and but little or no smoke.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Map showing the\r\n  COAL FIELDS\r\n  and\r\n  CHIEF MINING DISTRICTS\r\n  of\r\n  GREAT BRITAIN\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe _bituminous coals_, on the contrary, contain a large proportion of\r\nvolatile matter, amounting to as much as thirty, forty, or fifty per\r\ncent., and are consequently very inflammable, burning with a bright\r\nflame, considerable smoke, and a penetrating odour.\r\n\r\nBut as Nature in general does not love those sharp divisions to which\r\ntheorists are so partial, thus also there is no fixed boundary between\r\nthese two classes of mineral fuel; and we find an uninterrupted series\r\nof intermediate qualities between pure anthracite and the fattest coal.\r\n\r\nIt may be remarked that if coal were of one uniform chemical\r\ncomposition, its utility would be confined within narrower limits, as\r\nthe bituminous, semi-bituminous, and anthracital varieties have each\r\ntheir distinguishing properties which adapt each to special uses. Some\r\nkinds, from their richness in volatile bituminous matter, are excellent\r\nfor the manufacture of illuminating gas, while, from their smaller\r\nproportion of carbon, they could hardly be used for the making of iron;\r\nand the anthracites, which yield little or no gas, are very serviceable\r\nfor smelting or domestic purposes.\r\n\r\nIt appears from the researches of modern chemistry that the different\r\nvarieties of coal are due to the progress of decomposition which wood\r\nand vegetable matter undergo when buried in the earth, exposed to\r\nmoisture, and partially or entirely excluded from the air. Slowly\r\nevolving carbonic acid gas, and thus parting with a portion of their\r\noriginal oxygen, they become gradually converted into lignite or wood-\r\ncoal, which contains a larger proportion of hydrogen than wood does. A\r\ncontinuance of decomposition changes this lignite into common or\r\nbituminous coal, chiefly by the discharge of carburetted hydrogen, or\r\nthe gas by which we illuminate our streets and houses; and bituminous\r\ncoal still continuing to evolve its volatile matter, not only after its\r\nbeing covered with strata thousands of feet in thickness, but even to\r\nthe present day (as the fire-damp sufficiently proves) is thus\r\nultimately transformed into anthracite, to which the various names of\r\nsplint-coal, glance-coal, hard-coal, and culm have been given.\r\n\r\nWhen we consider the manner in which coal has been formed in swampy\r\nlowlands, or more particularly in river-deltas, which gradually subsided\r\nto a considerable depth beneath the level of the sea, we cannot wonder\r\nthat, when compared with the whole extent of the globe, the area of the\r\ncoal-fields is extremely limited, and confined to but a few favoured\r\ncountries. In our times delta lands occupy but a small part of the\r\ncontinents and large islands, and there is no reason to suppose that\r\nthey were more considerable during the carboniferous age, or at any\r\nother epoch. Besides, many of the ancient deltas, probably, never\r\nsubsided at all, so that no coal could be formed on their site; and\r\nothers, where coal strata were gradually piled up, may still be whelmed\r\nbeneath the sea awaiting some future upheaval to become serviceable to\r\nfuture generations of man.\r\n\r\nAfter the preliminary remarks on coal and the coal formation in general,\r\nI will now briefly describe the chief coal-producing countries of the\r\nglobe. First on the list stands Great Britain, whose pre-eminence in\r\nindustry and commerce is entirely founded on her vast deposits of coal.\r\nIt is this invaluable mineral which sets those countless steam-engines\r\nin motion that perform the labours of a hundred millions of men; which\r\nspins and weaves the cotton of America, the silk of China, the wool of\r\nAustralia, and the flax of Belgium into that amazing variety of tissues\r\nthat serve to clothe almost all the nations of the globe; and which\r\nfinally produces a greater quantity of the cheapest iron than the\r\ncombined efforts of all the world. Thus our coals may well be called our\r\nblack diamonds, and the comparison is indeed paying the latter too high\r\na compliment, for larger masses of diamonds would be utterly worthless,\r\nwhile, by means of our coal, we are able to enjoy the produce of every\r\nzone.\r\n\r\nNot only do our fifty-one coal-fields surpass in magnitude those which\r\nare disseminated over a far greater territory in Germany, Belgium, and\r\nFrance; but their local distribution and geological formation are as\r\nfavourable as could possibly be wished. Furthest north we see the\r\nconsiderable deposits of Scotland extending from the coast of Fife to\r\nthe valley of the Clyde. It is to them that Glasgow owes its half-a-\r\nmillion of inhabitants, and a wealth far surpassing that of all Scotland\r\nunder the reign of ‘bonnie’ Queen Mary. In England, north of the Trent,\r\nalong the Wear and Tyne, and even extending far beneath the sea, we have\r\nthe coal-fields of Northumberland and Durham, with Cumberland and those\r\nof Yorkshire, Nottinghamshire, and Derbyshire. After these comes the\r\nlarge field of Lancashire, or, as it is sometimes named, the Manchester\r\nCoal-field. Looking to the central districts, we see the coals of North\r\nand South Staffordshire and of Leicestershire. In the north-west we have\r\nthe field of North Wales; in the more central west, the deposits of the\r\nPlain of Shrewsbury, Coalbrook Dale, and the Clee Hills; and in the\r\nsouth-west, the great coal-field of South Wales, and the minor ones of\r\nthe Forest of Dean, of Somersetshire, and of Gloucestershire.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  COAL BASIN OF CLACKMANNANSHIRE.\r\n  _a_, _b_. Coal seams. _c_. Limestone strata. _x_, _y_. Slips.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe inspection of a good geological map shows us at once how\r\nadvantageously for commerce these several coal-stores are distributed.\r\nEvery large coal-field in England and Scotland is hardly ever distant\r\nmore than thirty miles from the next, so that from the Clyde to\r\nSomersetshire the whole interior of the country can easily, by means of\r\ncanals and railroads, be provided with fuel. The east and west coasts of\r\nthe land are nowhere above fifty miles from a coal-field; and even the\r\nmost remote localities in the three kingdoms are able to provide\r\nthemselves from distances within 150 miles.\r\n\r\nBut it is chiefly the neighbourhood of the sea which gives such an\r\nincomparable value to our most important coal-fields; as, thanks to this\r\nadvantageous situation, which none of the French, Belgian, and German\r\ncoal-fields possess, Great Britain is enabled to provide not only her\r\nown coast-towns, but almost all the sea-ports in the world, with a\r\ncheaper fuel than can be produced in their own country. Even in Ostend,\r\nBelgian coal, rendered dear by canal transport, is unable to compete\r\nwith that which is brought over sea from England; and Hamburg provides\r\nherself with fuel from Newcastle and Hartlepool, and not from the coal-\r\nfields of Saxony and Westphalia.\r\n\r\nCoal is found in seventeen counties in Ireland, over an area of about\r\n3,000 square miles. Yet, notwithstanding this great abundance of coal\r\nwhich the country possesses, and which is distributed throughout almost\r\nall parts of the island, from Limerick to Antrim, her capital and chief\r\ncities and ports have hitherto depended upon Great Britain for their\r\nsupplies of mineral fuel, both for domestic and for manufacturing\r\npurposes. To those who are unacquainted with the actual circumstances,\r\nit appears scarcely credible that this fine country has made so little\r\nuse of the coal which has been so bountifully bestowed upon her. Among\r\nother causes not political, which perpetuate this state of things, is\r\nthe extraordinary facility and cheapness with which the ports of Ireland\r\ncan be supplied from the great western coal-fields of Great Britain. The\r\nexcellence, abundance, and cheapness of peat, which is not only the\r\ncommon fuel of the poor in the interior, and, indeed, of all classes in\r\nsome districts, but is also brought in barges by the great canal, and\r\nconsumed to a considerable amount in the capital itself, is another\r\nreason why the Irish coal-mines have, as yet, been so little worked.\r\n\r\nWhen we consider the vast importance of coal, we cannot wonder at the\r\nparamount influence which it has exercised over the distribution of our\r\npopulation in modern times. While Salisbury, Winchester, and Canterbury—\r\nimportant towns of mediæval England—are reduced to atrophy from the\r\ndistance and absence of coal-fields, Newcastle, Leeds, Manchester,\r\nSheffield, Birmingham, Glasgow, and a host of other flourishing towns\r\nmay truly be said to be built on coal.\r\n\r\nWhere there are large coal-fields there is life and a prospect of almost\r\nunlimited prosperity, for they are sure to attract machinery and man.\r\nTake a geological map of a new and thinly-populated country; and if it\r\nbe marked with coal-fields the spots where large cities will exist\r\nhereafter may be safely determined.\r\n\r\nA more detailed examination of the chief coal-fields of England shows us\r\nthe immensity of the mineral riches which are here still hoarded up for\r\nthe benefit of future generations.\r\n\r\nThe superficial extent of the South Welsh coal-fields is about a\r\nthousand square miles. On its northern wing we find on an average\r\ntwenty-one coal bands, forming an aggregate thickness of eighty and a\r\nhalf feet. In some parts of the south wing there are even as many as\r\nthirty-three bands of an aggregate thickness of one hundred and four\r\nfeet of pure coal, so that the average depth of the field may be\r\nestimated at ninety-two feet.\r\n\r\nNumerous transversal valleys intersect this magnificent coal-field, and\r\nafford the easiest means of working it in every depth. They also\r\nfacilitate the transport of the coal on the canals and railroads which\r\nlead along their bottom or along their slopes to the harbours of the\r\nBristol Channel. In the chapters on iron and copper, I have had occasion\r\nto describe the gigantic industries, founded on these natural\r\nadvantages, which have raised South Wales from being one of the most\r\ninsignificant into one of the most important provinces of the empire.\r\n\r\nAll the coals of this basin are so rich in carbon as to yield from\r\nseventy to ninety per cent. of coke. They are either anthracites or only\r\nsemi-bituminous, and are consequently not suitable for making gas, nor\r\nare they much liked for burning in open fire-places, as they do not emit\r\na genial flame. On the other hand, the semi-bituminous Welsh coal is\r\ninvaluable for burning in steam-engines, for it has been proved to\r\ngenerate one-quarter more steam than any other kind of English coal. One\r\nof its properties—by no means unimportant—is its non-liability to\r\nspontaneous combustion, which, it is well known, occasionally takes\r\nplace with bituminous coals, and by which vessels have been lost at sea,\r\nand warehouses ignited on land. The value of the Welsh steam or slightly\r\nbituminous coal is enhanced by its quality of burning almost without\r\nsmoke, a property hitherto slightly appreciated, but the importance of\r\nwhich in time of war is evident. Steamers burning the fat, bituminous\r\ncoal can be tracked at sea at least seventy miles, before their hulls\r\nbecome visible, by the dense columns of black smoke pouring out of their\r\npipes or chimneys, and trailing along the horizon. It is a complete\r\ntell-tale of their whereabouts, which is not the case with vessels\r\nburning Welsh or anthracital coal. From its compactness and density, the\r\nlatter has likewise great advantages in point of stowage space over the\r\nordinary weak bituminous coals. For long voyages this concentration of\r\npower and economy of space may easily be appreciated. From its great\r\nsuperiority over other kinds, Welsh coal has been exclusively used for\r\nsome time past by the French Government, and it is also employed in\r\nEngland by all the chief mail packet companies.\r\n\r\nCoal is not exported from the South Wales basin as much as from some\r\nother fields, owing to the enormous requirements of the large iron\r\nworks, most of which consume as much as can be supplied by their\r\ncollieries. Every week, however, sees increased supplies of Welsh coal\r\nthrown into the London market, and every year fresh collieries are\r\nopened to meet the demand. The total number of pits in South Wales in\r\n1865 was four hundred and eighteen, which produced between seven and\r\neight million tons annually. The New Navigation Pit at Mountain Ash may\r\nbe cited as an example of the grand scale on which the most important of\r\nthese workings are conducted. The shaft is eighteen feet in diameter\r\ninside the walling, and divided into four compartments, two of which are\r\nfor the drawing of coal, one for sending the workmen up and down, and\r\nthe fourth for the drainage. Notwithstanding the great depth of three\r\nhundred and seventy yards, a carriage containing two half-tons of coal\r\ncan be wound up in one minute, and the whole colliery is estimated to\r\nsupply more than one thousand tons a day. The mineral property extends\r\nover an area of seven miles long by three miles in width, covering from\r\nfour thousand to five thousand acres of four-foot coal. From this one\r\ncase the reader may form a slight estimate of the boundless resources of\r\nthe whole basin.\r\n\r\nThe Great Central Coal-field, which ranges through South Yorkshire,\r\nNottinghamshire, and Derbyshire, has a superficial extent of about one\r\nthousand square miles. In character it is closely allied to that of\r\nNewcastle, and is considered by some geologists to be a re-emergence of\r\nthe same strata from beneath the covering of the magnesian limestone\r\nunder which they suppose it to be concealed through the intervening\r\nspace. It extends a little from the north-east of Leeds nearly to Derby,\r\na distance of more than sixty-five miles. Its greatest width—twenty-\r\nthree miles—is on the north, reaching nearly to Halifax on the west. On\r\nthe south it extends towards the east to Nottingham, and is there about\r\ntwelve miles wide. Though possessing some fine coal-seams, it is of far\r\ninferior importance to the Manchester or South Lancashire Coal-field,\r\nfrom which it is separated by a lofty chain of hills. This highly\r\nvaluable basin, which extends over about five hundred and fifty square\r\nmiles, begins in the north-west of Derbyshire, and continues thence to\r\nthe south-west part of Lancashire, forming an area somewhat in the shape\r\nof a crescent, having Manchester nearly in the centre.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  DUDLEY COAL-FIELD.\r\n  1. Limestone strata. 2. Coal.\r\n]\r\n\r\nOf the smaller coal-fields, the most important are the Whitehaven basin\r\n(one hundred and twenty square miles) and the Dudley or South\r\nStaffordshire area (ninety square miles) which is particularly valuable\r\nfor the extensive iron works which it maintains. One portion of this\r\ncoal-field is distinguished by the presence of one continuous bed of\r\ncoal thirty feet thick, which for British coal is astonishing; and this\r\nmass extends seven miles in length and four in breadth. In this favoured\r\ndistrict coal-seams five or six feet thick are called thin seams; in\r\nNewcastle they would be called thick seams.\r\n\r\nThough not so extensive as the South Welsh area, the coal-fields of\r\nNewcastle and Durham are of far more ancient celebrity. Their produce is\r\nchiefly shipped on the Tyne, Wear, and Tees, small rivers hardly\r\ntraceable on a map of the world, and yet far more important to commerce\r\nthan the mighty Orinoco or the thousand-armed Amazon. This magnificent\r\ncoal area is bounded on the north by the river Coquet, and extends\r\nsouthward nearly as far as Hartlepool, a distance of about forty-eight\r\nmiles. Its extreme breadth is about twenty-four miles, and the whole\r\nsuperficial extent may amount to about eight hundred square miles.\r\n\r\nThere are in all about fifty-seven different seams of coal in the Great\r\nNorthern Coal-field, varying in thickness from an inch to five feet five\r\ninches and six feet, and comprising an aggregate of about seventy-six\r\nfeet of coal.\r\n\r\nThe pits are established chiefly with reference to one or more of the\r\nthree following seams. The most valuable is called the _High Main Seam_,\r\nand is about six feet thick. The next in value is the _Bensham Seam_,\r\nabout three feet thick, which is remarkable for its excellent quality as\r\na domestic coal, and for the enormous quantity of gas evolved from it in\r\nthe mine. The _Hutton or Low Main Seam_, averaging from three feet six\r\ninches to five feet nine inches, is likewise of very good quality, and\r\nis extensively worked. It must, however, be remarked that the same seam\r\nof coal is not generally valuable in all places. Thus the High Main,\r\nwhich furnishes excellent coal on the Tyne, becomes injured as it\r\nproceeds in a south-easterly direction by being intermixed with a band\r\nof coal of inferior quality containing iron pyrites, &c.\r\n\r\nThe Newcastle Coal-field is generally worked at a great depth, an\r\nexpense of upwards of 50,000_l._ having in some instances been incurred\r\nbefore the seam of coal was reached which was to reward all this vast\r\noutlay and labour. The most remarkable and enterprising work of this\r\nkind on record is a sinking at Monk Wearmouth Colliery near Sunderland.\r\nAfter piercing the superincumbent beds of magnesian limestone and lower\r\nnew red sandstone, the coal strata were reached at a depth of three\r\nhundred and thirty feet; but at the same time a spring was tapped which\r\npoured water into the workings at the rate of three thousand gallons per\r\nminute. This fearful influx was kept under by a steam-engine of two\r\nhundred horse-power, and the work was made sure by strong metal tubbing,\r\nand carried on successfully, though not without extreme difficulty. On\r\nentering the coal measures, however, a new and unexpected check was\r\nexperienced in the extra thickness of the uppermost coal strata, for\r\nwhich no calculation had been made, and the difficulties were increased\r\nwhen at the depth of one thousand feet a fresh _feeder_ or spring of\r\nwater was tapped. Additional expense and great loss of time were thus\r\ncaused; but the proprietors persevered with real Anglo-Saxon\r\npertinacity, undaunted by the apparently hopeless nature of the\r\nundertaking, and by the fearful expenses incurred. Success crowned their\r\nefforts, and finally, at a depth of 1,710 feet, the Hutton seam of coal\r\nwas reached, at a cost which, including the necessary preliminary\r\noperations, could not have been less than 100,000_l._\r\n\r\nAnother remarkable and costly piece of mining was that of Gosforth\r\nColliery, which lies about three miles north from Newcastle, on the west\r\nbank of a romantic ‘dean’ or little valley, through which the Ouseburn\r\nwinds its way to the Tyne. The sinking was commenced in 1825, and the\r\ncoal was won on Saturday, January 31, 1829. The High Main coal was\r\nreached at twenty-five fathoms below the surface, but near its first\r\nappearance the seam was thrown down in an inclined direction by the\r\ngreat Ninety Fathom Dyke which there intersects the coal-field. Hence it\r\nbecame necessary to sink the shaft to the depth of 181 fathoms, in order\r\nto come at the level of the lower range of coal. This having been\r\naccomplished, a horizontal drift 700 yards long was worked through the\r\nface of the dyke to the seam of coal a little above its junction with\r\nthe dyke. A great part of this excavation had to be made through solid\r\nrock. To celebrate the completion of this remarkable work, a grand\r\nsubterranean ball was given at the very place of triumph, 1,100 feet\r\nbelow the surface of the earth. As the guests arrived at the bottom of\r\nthe shaft they went to the end of the drift to the face of the coal,\r\nwhere each person hewed a piece of coal as a memento of the day, and\r\nthen returned to the ball-room, which was brilliantly lit up, and where\r\nborn-and-bred ladies joined in a general dance with born-and-bred\r\npitmen’s daughters. Between 200 and 300 persons were present, nearly\r\none-half of them belonging to the fair sex. It must be remembered that\r\nthe pit had not been worked, so that no smoke and dust exuded from its\r\nmouth or defiled the ball-room.\r\n\r\nSome of the older coal-pits, where excavations have been going on\r\nperhaps for a century or more, may be likened to large subterranean\r\ncities. The galleries of St. Hilda Colliery, near South Shields, are\r\nfull seventy miles long; and Killingworth pits are said, on good\r\nauthority, to have nearly one hundred and sixty miles of gallery\r\nexcavation.\r\n\r\nIn some parts the operations of the collier have encroached upon the\r\ndomains of the ocean. At the Howgill pits, for instance, west of\r\nWhitehaven, the excavations have been carried more than 1,000 yards\r\nunder the sea, and about 600 feet below its bottom. But the most\r\nremarkable marine colliery which Great Britain has ever possessed was\r\nsituated at Borrowstounness. The coal was found to continue under the\r\nbed of the sea in this place, and the colliers had the courage to work\r\nit half a mile from the shore, where there was an entry that went down\r\ninto the submarine coal-pit. This was made into a kind of round quay,\r\nbuilt so as to keep out the tide which flowed there twelve feet. Here\r\nthe coals were laid, and a ship of that draught of water could lay her\r\nside to the quay and take in the coal. This wonderful pit, which\r\nbelonged to the Earl of Kincardine’s family, continued to be wrought\r\nmany years to the great profit of the owners, and the astonishment of\r\nall that saw it; but at last an unexpected high tide drowned the whole\r\nat once, together with the labourers who were at work. ‘While,’ says the\r\nFrench geologist, Faujas de Saint Fond (who visited this remarkable mine\r\nabout the end of the last century), ‘the pitmen, by the dismal shine of\r\ntheir lamps, make the deep caverns resound with the blows of their\r\npickaxes, ships driven by a fair wind sail over their heads, and the\r\nsailors, rejoicing at the beautiful weather, express their joy in songs:\r\nat another time a storm arises; the horizon is in flames, the thunder\r\nroars, the sea rages, the boldest tremble; then the pitmen, unconscious\r\nof the terrible scene, calmly pursue their labours, and think with\r\npleasure of their homes, while the ship above is shattered to pieces and\r\nsinks; unfortunately, but too faithful a picture of the daily changes of\r\nhuman life.’\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Map showing the\r\n  COAL FIELDS\r\n  and\r\n  MINERAL DISTRICTS\r\n  of\r\n  AMERICA\r\n]\r\n\r\nNowhere in the world, perhaps, does human activity display a more\r\nrestless energy than on the site of the Newcastle Coal-field, where,\r\nnight and day, successive trains heaped with the black diamonds of\r\nEngland speed along far-stretching railways, and hurry down to river and\r\nocean, until they are unloaded and their contents shipped by machinery.\r\nSteam-engines are unceasingly at work drawing coals and pumping out\r\nwater. Thousands of men are underneath our feet cutting down the coal by\r\nsevere and peculiar labour, while thousands above are receiving the\r\nloads and speeding them forwards.\r\n\r\n‘Go where you will, there is a network of small railways, leading from\r\npit to pit in hopeless intricacy, but all having a common terminus on\r\nthe river’s bank or the ocean’s shore. Go where you will, tall chimneys\r\nrise up before you, and here and there a low line of black sheds,\r\nflanked by chimneys of aspiring altitude, indicates that you are\r\narriving at a colliery. As you draw nearer, men and boys of blackest hue\r\npass you and peer at you with inquiring glances. Now trains of coal-\r\nwaggons rush by more frequently, noises of the most discordant character\r\nincrease, and you know that you are at the pit’s mouth, when you behold\r\ntwo gigantic wooden arms slanting upwards, upon which are mounted the\r\npulleys and wheels that carry the huge flat wire ropes of the shaft. For\r\na moment the wheels do not revolve—no load is ascending or descending—\r\nbut the next minute they turn rapidly, and up comes the load of coals or\r\nhuman beings to the surface. Perhaps the most impressive sight is a\r\nlarge colliery fully engaged at nightwork, with burning crates of coal\r\nsuspended all around; and after this a view from some neighbouring\r\neminence of all the far-flaming waste coal-heaps, burning up the\r\naccumulation of waste and small coal not worth carriage, ever added to\r\nthe ever-consuming mound, until the whole district appears like the\r\nactive crater of some enormous volcano.’[65]\r\n\r\nFootnote 65:\r\n\r\n  ‘Edinburgh Review,’ vol. cxi. p. 86.\r\n\r\nThe banks of the Tyne are in many places very high and precipitous, and\r\nconsequently render peculiar contrivances necessary for the shipping of\r\nthe coals. The means used for this purpose are various: sometimes\r\ninclined tunnels, through which the train of waggons is lowered in\r\nchains to the water; sometimes slopes, along which the coals are\r\nshovelled into the ship, or still better, the ingenious mechanism of\r\nwhich William Howitt gives us the following description:—\r\n\r\n‘As you advance over the plain you see a whole train of waggons loaded\r\nwith coal, careering by themselves without horse, without steam-engine,\r\nwithout man, except that there sits one behind, who, instead of\r\nendeavouring to propel these mad waggons on their way, seems labouring\r\nhopelessly by his weight to detain them.\r\n\r\n‘But what is your amazement when you come in sight of the river Tyne,\r\nand see these waggons still careering on to the very brink of the\r\nwater!—to see a railway carried from the high bank, and supported on\r\ntall piles, horizontally, above the surface of the river, and to some\r\ndistance into it, as if to allow those vagabond trains of waggons to run\r\nright off, and dash themselves down into the river!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SHIPPING COAL.]\r\n\r\n‘There they go, all mad together! Another moment, and they will shoot\r\nover the end of the lofty railway, and go headlong into the Tyne,\r\nhelter-skelter. But behold! these creatures are not so mad as you\r\nimagine them. They are instinct with sense; they have a principle of\r\nself-preservation, as well as of speed, in them. See, as they draw near\r\nthe river they pause, they stop! one by one they detach themselves; and\r\nas one devoted waggon runs on, like a victim given up for the salvation\r\nof the rest, to perform a wild summersault into the water below, what do\r\nwe see? It is caught! A pair of gigantic arms separate themselves from\r\nthe end of the railway. They catch the waggon, they hold it suspended in\r\nthe air, they let it softly and gently descend—and whither? Into the\r\nwater? No; we see now that a ship already lies below the end of the\r\nrailway. The waggon descends to it; a man standing there strikes a bolt,\r\nthe bottom falls, and the coals which it contains are nicely deposited\r\nin the hold of the vessel. Up, again, soars the empty waggon in that\r\npair of gigantic arms. It reaches the railway; it glides like a black\r\nswan into its native lake upon it; and away it goes, as of its own\r\naccord, to a distance, to await its brethren, who successively perform\r\nthe same exploit, and then joining it, all scamper back again as hard as\r\nthey can over the plain to the distant pit.’\r\n\r\nThe produce of the collieries situated further up the Tyne, where the\r\nriver is no longer navigable by sea-going craft, is conveyed in a kind\r\nof oval vessels, called keels, to the port of Newcastle, or its out-\r\nstations, North and South Shields, where it is discharged into larger\r\nships.\r\n\r\nNewcastle may well be called the capital of King Coal. Once a town of\r\nmilitary importance, as the old, grim-looking donjon-keep of Robert\r\nCurthose, the son of the Conqueror, still testifies, it entirely owes\r\nits modern importance to the treasures of coal adjacent to its walls.\r\nIts quays, black and sooty as the mineral on which its prosperity is\r\nfounded, are lined with a dense row of counting-houses, and before them\r\nin the river still denser rows of colliers lie at anchor; while between\r\nboth ebbs and flows a black-looking crowd—for all here wear the livery\r\nof the article to which all owe their bread. Some idea may be formed of\r\nthe vast activity waving to and fro in this chief artery of the coal\r\ntrade, from the fact that the annual arrivals in the Tyne are not less\r\nthan 13,000 or 14,000, 10,000 of which are on account of the coal trade.\r\n\r\nSunderland, the great port of the river Wear, where annually more than\r\n10,000 cargoes of coal are shipped to all ports of the world;\r\nHartlepool, a town of modern date with magnificent docks; Stockton-on-\r\nTees, and a number of minor places of shipment on the coast, likewise\r\nowe their prosperity to coal, so that probably no other article of trade\r\ngives constant employment to so many vessels within so confined a\r\nterritory.\r\n\r\nFrom Tynemouth Priory, a ruin romantically situated on a bold\r\npromontory, the visitor frequently enjoys a magnificent marine picture;\r\nfor when, after long-continued easterly gales, the wind changes to a\r\nwesterly breeze, many hundred vessels—mostly colliers—put to sea\r\ntogether in a single tide, and distribute themselves over the ocean with\r\ntheir prows turned in almost every direction, some southward and coast-\r\nwise, for English ports, for the Channel, and for the southern countries\r\nof Europe; others, northward for Scotland and the Norwegian coast; and\r\nothers, again, due east, for Denmark and the Baltic—all sinking deep in\r\nthe water, weighed down by that mineral fuel which is more valuable for\r\nEngland than if it were replaced by the mines of Mexico or the diggings\r\nof Australia.\r\n\r\nYet a few years, and probably the dingy and crawling craft, which\r\nperform the chief part in this animated scene, will be abolished.\r\nClipper screw steamers are rapidly taking their place, and the railroads\r\ndaily transport a greater proportion of the seven or eight million tons\r\nof coal which are annually devoured by our huge metropolis.\r\n\r\nBefore quitting the Northern coal districts, a few words may be added on\r\nthe swarthy population whose labours bring their subterranean riches to\r\nthe light. The chief underground workmen are the hewers, who either\r\nremove the coal with pickaxes, or sometimes blast it with powder. To hew\r\nwell is a work of skill as well as of strength, and men must be early\r\npractised in it to earn high wages by piece-work. In tolerably thick\r\nseams of coal of five and six feet and upwards, hewing is more a work of\r\nstrength than skill; but in the narrower seams skill predominates. In\r\nthese the arm is confined, the blow is shortened, the pick is impeded.\r\nTo gain space by adaptation of position, you may see one hewer kneeling\r\ndown on one or both knees, another squatting, another stooping or\r\nbending double, and occasionally one or more lying on their sides or on\r\ntheir backs, picking and pegging away at the seam above them. If the\r\nseam be hard as well as thin, and the man’s position confined, it is\r\nmanifest that he cannot get his strength to bear in full, or his full\r\nmeasure of coals. In such cases he is bathed in perspiration, in a state\r\nof semi-nudity, enveloped in floating and clinging coal-dust. If to this\r\nwe add the very faint light imparted by the Davy lamps, the constantly\r\nthickening atmosphere, the exhalations from living beings, exaggerated\r\nby heat, and not diminished by any free current of air, and remember\r\nthat eight hours is the usual day’s work of the hewer, we must surely\r\nconfess that few men have their strength more hardly tasked, or earn\r\ntheir bread in a more laborious manner.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COAL HEWERS AT WORK.]\r\n\r\nTo relieve this arduous toil, coal-cutting machines have lately been\r\ndevised, which are worked either by steam or by compressed air, and will\r\nprobably in time perform a great part of the hewer’s labour, as those\r\nalready in employment appear to be well adapted to the purpose for which\r\nthey are contrived, and further improvements in their construction will\r\nno doubt be introduced. Coal-cutting machines, which act either by\r\npicking or gouging, have been found to work more economically than\r\nmanual labour, while at the same time much less coal is destroyed and\r\nreduced to slack. A matter of still more importance is the diminished\r\nrisk to the persons and lives of the employed, who, when working in a\r\nconstrained position, and consequently unable to relieve themselves from\r\nthe fall of a superincumbent mass of coal, are frequently crushed to\r\ndeath. The application of machinery to cutting coal gives another\r\nadvantage of national importance, as, by enabling the working to be\r\ncarried into the deeper seams of coal which lie at so high a temperature\r\nas to present serious or insurmountable difficulty to handwork, it will\r\nrender available to posterity new and hitherto inaccessible stores of\r\ncoal.\r\n\r\nThe hewers may possibly fear to be thrown out of employment by its\r\nintroduction on an extensive scale; but as it will relieve them from\r\ntheir most irksome drudgery, and allow them to reserve their strength\r\nfor less injurious trial, they cannot but be thankful for the aid which\r\nit affords them.\r\n\r\nThey are usually paid according to the number of baskets or tubs they\r\nare able to fill. These are then conveyed by the putters through the\r\nsmaller or lower galleries of the pit to the headways, where they are\r\nhoisted by the crow-men upon the rolleys or waggons for transporting the\r\ncoals from the crow to the shaft. The roads along which the rolleys are\r\ndriven are made sufficiently high for an ordinary horse by cutting away\r\nthe roof or the floor. Some of them are two miles long, and are kept in\r\nrepair by a rolley-wayman. Where tubs are used for the conveyance of\r\ncoal the whole way, no crow is necessary, but a lad, termed a ‘flatman,’\r\nwho links the tubs together at the level or the flat.\r\n\r\nNext to the hewers, the putters are the hardest labourers in the pit;\r\nand in some places their labour is even harder, for it is no easy matter\r\nto push corfs or tubs, weighing from six to ten hundredweight, along\r\ngalleries which are often but three or four feet high, where the heat\r\nnot seldom averages about 78° Fahr., and in consequence of the increased\r\npressure of the air, water boils at 220°. The term ‘putter’ includes the\r\nspecific distinctions of the ‘headsman,’ ‘half-marrow,’ and the ‘foal.’\r\nWhere full tubs or baskets are to be pushed along the rails from the\r\nhewers to the crow and the rolley-drivers, the headsmen take the chief\r\npart; a half-marrow goes at each end of the train alternately with\r\nanother half-marrow; while a foal always precedes the train. At the\r\nbottom of the shaft the ‘onsetters’ are stationed, who attach the tubs\r\nto the ropes which hoist them to the surface. Besides these various\r\nclasses of workmen, we find the ‘shifters,’ who keep the galleries in\r\nrepair, and the little ‘trapper-boys,’ whose duty it is to open the\r\nventilating-doors whenever they hear the drivers or trains of coal-\r\nwaggons coming on one side or the other. Their task, though humble,\r\ntedious, and requiring the least amount of intelligence, is of great\r\nimportance, as the numerous doors which they guard must remain open only\r\nlong enough for the passage of the trains, and must then be closed again\r\nimmediately, or the current of air needed to ventilate the mine would be\r\ndiverted in its course. It is hardly possible to imagine a more joyless\r\nchildhood than that of these little fellows, condemned to sit in\r\nsolitary gloom during the greater part of the day, and only comforted by\r\nthe sudden shout or song of a team-driver, approaching with his train of\r\nwaggons, and demanding the opening of the door.\r\n\r\nBesides the workers underground, a number of labourers or artisans are\r\nconstantly employed above pit, from the ‘banksmen,’ whose duty it is to\r\nsee all things living and lifeless up and down the shaft, to the\r\n‘staithmen,’ who attend to the staith or shipping place of coals. Many\r\nfind constant occupation in the raff-yard, where old waggons, ironwork,\r\nand woodwork are duly hospitalled and refitted for fresh duty.\r\n\r\nThe daily work of the mine is conducted according to the strictest\r\ndiscipline. The ‘resident viewer’ is supreme, and has subordinate\r\nviewers, overseers, and wastemen, lamp-keepers, and other officers, who\r\nhave each their departments, and discharge their duties assiduously.\r\n\r\nThus a first-rate northern colliery establishment—where a total of more\r\nthan five hundred persons are variously employed—resembles a little\r\ncommunity in itself. Men of all educations, arts, grades, and duties,\r\nand males of almost all ages, from ten years, are here; men, too, of all\r\nappearances—from the gentlemanly viewer to the doubtful wasteman, and\r\nfrom the underground workers-in-chief—the hewers—to the humble trapper-\r\nboys.\r\n\r\nThe peculiar nature of his underground occupations, which condemns the\r\npitman, while working, to a position of great restraint, and taxes the\r\nlimbs and muscles in a very unequal manner, naturally influences his\r\noutward appearance, so that he can be easily distinguished from every\r\nother operative.\r\n\r\nHis stature is diminutive, his figure disproportioned and misshapen; his\r\nlegs being much bowed, and his chest protruding like that of a pigeon.\r\nHis arms are long, and oddly suspended. His countenance is not less\r\nstrange than his figure, his cheeks being generally hollow, his brow\r\noverhanging, his cheekbones high, his forehead low and retreating, his\r\ncomplexion pallid. Many of these bodily peculiarities or malformations\r\nare probably hereditary. Pitmen have always lived in communities; they\r\nhave associated only among themselves, and have thus acquired peculiar\r\nhabits and ideas. They almost invariably intermarry, and it is not\r\nuncommon in their marriages to commingle the blood of the same family.\r\nThey have thus transmitted natural and accidental defects through a long\r\nseries of generations, and may now be regarded in the light of a\r\ndistinct race of beings. In spite of the general march of intelligence,\r\ntheir education is still very imperfect, and they are just emerging from\r\nthe greatest possible moral and intellectual darkness—an improvement due\r\nmainly to the Wesleyan Methodists. The untiring labours of this\r\nreligious sect not only imparted to the colliery population in the North\r\nof England a higher tone of moral feeling, but in their efforts to\r\ninstil religious principles into their minds, afforded them, through\r\nSunday-schools, a slight amount of education and an imperfect capability\r\nof reading. These first seeds of improvement will, it is hoped,\r\ngradually ripen into fruit, and oppose a strong barrier to the prominent\r\nvices of colliers—gambling and intemperance.\r\n\r\nA lack of mental and personal openness and boldness, a great inclination\r\nto injury and theft, the grossest superstition, and a want of the\r\ncommonest economy and forethought, are likewise faults which are said to\r\nbe very common among them. Deception is so much a practice with them\r\nthat they deceive when no earthly advantage can be obtained from their\r\ndishonesty.\r\n\r\nOh the other hand, the proofs of filial affection which they exhibit,\r\nand the noble feelings and heroism which they display when explosions or\r\naccidents take place, prove that the groundwork of their character is\r\ngood, and merely requires the influence of a better education to remove\r\na great part of the blemishes which ignorance has engrafted upon an\r\noriginally wholesome stock. Under every disadvantage, several eminent\r\nmen have sprung from their class. Thomas Bewick, the celebrated wood-\r\nengraver, was early immured in pits; the late celebrated mathematician,\r\nDr. Hutton, was originally a hewer of coal; Professor Hann, of King’s\r\nCollege, in London, was a boy working underground in a northern\r\ncolliery; and George Stephenson, the illustrious engineer whose\r\nwonderful inventions have revolutionised the world, and who, after the\r\nlapse of many ages, will still be reckoned among England’s most\r\nillustrious sons, began life as a trapper.\r\n\r\nThough the use of coal was already known to the ancient Britons, yet the\r\nfirst public notice of the mineral is mentioned by Hume to have been in\r\nthe time of Henry III., who, in the year 1272, granted a licence to dig\r\ncoals to the town of Newcastle. Somewhat later in 1291, the abbot and\r\nmonastery of Dunfermline in Scotland obtained a similar grant. The first\r\ncoal is said to have been brought to London about the year 1305, where\r\nit was used only by smiths, dyers, and soap-boilers. The smoke, which\r\nwas supposed to be injurious to health, caused great annoyance to the\r\nwealthier inhabitants of the city, so that in 1316 its use was\r\nprohibited by a decree of Edward I. This ordinance seems, however, to\r\nhave been but little attended to; for a few years later inspectors were\r\nnamed to levy fines in case of its non-observance, and if these proved\r\nineffectual, to demolish the fireplaces arranged for the burning of\r\ncoal. The complaints against this fuel continued several centuries, for\r\nas late as 1661 King Charles II. was prayed to remedy the nuisance by\r\nbanishing from town manufacturers who required large quantities of coal.\r\n\r\nYet, in spite of all the interdictions, complaints, and prejudices\r\narrayed against it, coal continued to grow in use; for as early as 1615,\r\nNewcastle gave employment to about four hundred vessels, one-half of\r\nwhich number supplied the demands of London. French ships even then\r\nfetched coals in that port, and the Hanse towns conveyed them to\r\nFlanders.\r\n\r\nAbout the middle of the seventeenth century the coal trade,\r\nnotwithstanding an increase of price, required nine hundred vessels; and\r\nfifty years later, half a million of tons were exported from Newcastle,\r\nrequiring fourteen hundred vessels for their carriage. During the\r\neighteenth century the northern coal trade constantly increased with the\r\nsteady growth of London, which in 1770, although not possessing one-\r\nsixth of its present population, already consumed seven hundred thousand\r\ntons; and it would have been impossible for the collieries to satisfy\r\nthe constantly growing demand if the invention of the steam-engine had\r\nnot lent its powerful aid to raise larger quantities of coal from a\r\ngreater depth, and to drain many works which otherwise would have been\r\ndeluged with water.\r\n\r\nThe other English coal-fields began to be worked at a much later period\r\nthan that of Newcastle, but rapidly grew in importance with the vast\r\nincrease of our manufactories and smelting furnaces.\r\n\r\nThe extraction of coal is indeed constantly increasing at a truly\r\ngigantic rate. Thus, in 1845 our whole annual production was rated at\r\nthirty-five millions of tons; in 1859 it amounted, according to\r\ntrustworthy returns, to sixty-eight millions; in 1865 it had advanced to\r\nninety-six million tons; and now probably exceeds one hundred million\r\ntons—a mass so enormous that with it a girdle of coal three feet wide,\r\nand about seven high, might be put round the earth.\r\n\r\nThe question of the duration of our coal-fields is evidently one of\r\ngreat national interest. It has of late excited the attention both of\r\nstatesmen and philosophers, but unfortunately it is more easily put than\r\nanswered. While some authorities give us the cheering assurance that we\r\nhave enough to last us for the next two thousand years at least, others\r\nlimit our supply to three or four centuries, or assign even a couple of\r\nhundred years as the period when our descendants will have to seek their\r\ncoals in the mines of other countries. The quantity of fuel left in the\r\nNewcastle basin—the most anciently worked of our coal-fields—was\r\nestimated by Mr. Hall, in 1854, at 5,121,888,956 tons. Dividing this\r\ntotal by 20,000,000 of tons as the present annual consumption, the\r\nfuture supplies of this famous coal-field would thus be limited to about\r\ntwo hundred and fifty years—a very short period in the history of a\r\nnation. The immense consumption of coal in the iron furnaces and\r\nfoundries of Staffordshire will probably lead to an exhaustion of that\r\ncoal-field even before Northumberland and Durham, for its area is\r\nscarcely more than one-half of the area of the Northern Coal-field. It\r\nhas, indeed, one very thick seam of coal of from thirty to forty feet,\r\nbut this will not alone compensate the difference. The coal-fields of\r\nYorkshire, Lancashire, and Derbyshire, situated amongst the numerous\r\niron-works and manufactories, as well as large populations, justify a\r\nsimilar prophecy; but, on the other hand, better prospects are held out\r\nby the great coal-field of South Wales.\r\n\r\nAfter deducting the coal practically unattainable from its depth, sixty\r\nthousand millions of tons may be considered a liberal estimate of the\r\navailable mass. At the present rate of extraction (ten millions of tons)\r\nthis would give a supply for the next six thousand years; but supposing\r\nthe other sources to fail, the extraction of coal from the South Wales\r\nbasin would of course be increased to such an extent as to limit its\r\nduration to six or seven centuries. It may be remarked that the largest\r\nestimates of future coal supply are based on the assumption that mines\r\nmay be worked at a depth of four or five thousand feet; but this is very\r\nproblematical. Mechanical skill may indeed pierce shafts to this depth,\r\nor even deeper; but the increase of temperature which is raised by one\r\ndegree for about every successive seventy feet, along with the\r\nincreasing density of the air, must ever oppose insuperable obstacles to\r\nhuman labour at such a distance below the level of the sea. To the\r\nnatural heat and density arising from depth must be added the\r\ncorruptions arising from human perspiration, which are constantly on the\r\nincrease during working hours in working places. ‘We speak,’ says the\r\nauthor of an excellent article in the _Quarterly Review_,[66] ‘from some\r\nbrief personal experience of what these things are at a depth of nearly\r\neighteen hundred feet, where the actual temperature varied from eighty-\r\nfive to eighty-six and a half degrees. Such experience is necessary to\r\nqualify any man to judge of the vertical limit of human labour, and we\r\nhesitate to fix it at more than two thousand five hundred feet, and\r\nshould fix it at that depth only for the hardiest of hewers and haulers\r\nof coal.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 66:\r\n\r\n  Volume cx.\r\n\r\nThe pressure of superincumbent strata, which renders the upholding of\r\nthe roof, even at fourteen or fifteen hundred feet, a problem of\r\nceaseless anxiety and expense, must also be taken into account. At\r\ndepths much exceeding two thousand feet, it is very doubtful if the\r\nroofs could be securely upheld except at such an outlay as would\r\nconsiderably raise the cost of extraction, while the coal itself would\r\nbe more and more dense, and therefore more and more difficult to\r\ndislodge. For these various reasons, all the strata of coal situated\r\nbelow the depth of two thousand five hundred feet, or at the very utmost\r\nthree thousand feet, may be considered as practically unworkable; and\r\nthus sober-minded calculators, on comparing the available solid contents\r\nof our coal-fields with the rate of extraction, have come to the\r\nconclusion that a thousand years is the maximum of the probable future\r\nsupply of England and Wales. Adding to this the Scotch and Irish coal,\r\nwhich are not included in the estimate, and swelling our account with\r\nlignite and peat, we have at any rate sufficient materials for keeping\r\nour fires burning for a good time to come, and may safely leave all\r\ndesponding views on the subject to distant generations.\r\n\r\nNext to England, no European country has so rapidly increased its coal\r\nproduction as the German empire, where, thanks to the railroads, the\r\nconsumption of mineral fuel is yearly extending over a wider range, and\r\ngradually supplanting in many localities the use of wood. The official\r\ntables inform us that in 1866, 432,594,926 cwt. of black coal, and\r\n130,661,182 cwt. of lignite—together, about 28 million tons—were\r\nproduced, a mass considerably greater than the joint production of\r\nFrance and Belgium, and equal to about seven twenty-fifths of the\r\nproduction of England. The chief coal-fields are those of Upper Silesia,\r\nof the Ruhr, of the Saar, of Waldenburg (in Lower Silesia), of Dresden\r\nand Zwickau (in Saxony), of Aachen (Aix-la-Chapelle), Ibbenburen, and\r\nMinden, which not only supply the greater part of Germany, but also\r\nyield a considerable exportation to France, Switzerland, and Holland.\r\n\r\nThe German ports on the North Sea and the Baltic still largely consume\r\nBritish coal, which, however, has been entirely driven from the Rhine;\r\nand Berlin, which in 1860 burnt 202,970 tons of English coal, consumed\r\nlittle more than one-half that quantity (123,401 tons) in 1865, in spite\r\nof a considerable increase of population; while at the same time the\r\nconsumption of coal from Upper Silesia increased from 61,700 to 323,712\r\ntons.\r\n\r\nThe small but thriving kingdom of Belgium, where the collieries of\r\nLiège, Namur, and Hainaut give rise to a commercial activity unequalled\r\non the Continent, occupies the third rank among the coal countries of\r\nEurope, its production in 1863 having amounted to 10,500,000 tons. The\r\nprovinces of Namur and Liège consume almost all the coal they produce,\r\nwhile Mons and Charleroi, in Hainaut, export more than three millions of\r\ntons to France.\r\n\r\nThis country, which, in 1862, produced 9,400,000 tons of coal, requires\r\nat least 16,000,000 for its consumption, and imports the difference from\r\nBelgium, England, and Germany. The chief coal-basins are situated in the\r\ndepartments of the Loire, du Nord, Saône-et-Loire, and Gard, which\r\nfurnish about seven-eighths of the whole production. Austria, whose\r\nprincipal coal mines are situated in Bohemia, produces about 3,500,000\r\ntons. Spain possesses magnificent coal-fields in the Asturias and\r\nSantanders, but as yet they have been but little worked.\r\n\r\nBesides the coal-basins of the mother country, Britain is richly\r\nprovided with coals in many of her colonies. In New South Wales and\r\nTasmania, in Labuan and Farther India, in Hindostan and New Zealand, in\r\nBritish Columbia and Honduras, valuable basins or seams of coal have\r\nbeen discovered; and a magnificent coal-field, far surpassing in\r\nmagnitude those of the British Islands, extends from Newfoundland, by\r\nCape Breton, Prince Edward Island, and Nova Scotia, across a large\r\nportion of New Brunswick. Thus far it has been but little worked, in\r\ncountries but thinly peopled, and covered for the most part with\r\nboundless forests; but as from its general proximity to the sea it\r\noffers every advantage for mining operations, a brilliant future may\r\nsafely be predicted for the lands it underlies.\r\n\r\nThe coal-fields of the United States are of still more ample\r\nproportions, as they surpass in extent all the known coal-basins of the\r\nworld besides. Beyond the Alleghany Mountains we find the magnificent\r\nAppalachian Coal-field, traversing eight of the principal States in the\r\nAmerican Union, from the northern frontiers of Pennsylvania to Alabama,\r\nand covering a space of about sixty-five thousand square miles.\r\n\r\nOf scarcely inferior extent are the vast coal-fields of Indiana,\r\nIllinois, and Kentucky, which nearly equal in magnitude the whole of\r\nEngland; and another smaller but highly important coal region is\r\nsituated between the lakes Erie, Huron, and Michigan, not to mention the\r\nminor coal-basins scattered here and there from Texas to Missouri, and\r\nfrom New York to Maine.\r\n\r\nAs yet, the Americans have not derived full benefit from their\r\nextraordinary coal deposits; but the possession of so vast an\r\naccumulation of _power_ allows us to predict a future of almost\r\nboundless enterprise and production for that wonderful country.\r\n\r\nWhile in most of our coal-seams deep shafts have to be sunk to obtain\r\nthe coal, and steam power has to be constantly employed to prevent its\r\nsubmersion, the Appalachian Coal-field is intersected by three great\r\nnavigable rivers, the Monongahela, the Alleghany, and the Ohio, all of\r\nwhich lay open on their banks the level seams of coal. At Brownhill, on\r\nthe first of these rivers, the main seam of bituminous coal, ten feet\r\nthick, breaks out in the steep cliff at the water’s edge. Horizontal\r\ngalleries may be driven everywhere at very slight expense, and so worked\r\nas to drain themselves, while the cars laden with coal, and attached to\r\neach other, glide down on a railway so as to deliver their burden into\r\nbarges moored to the river’s bank. The same seam may be followed the\r\nwhole way to Pittsburg, fifty miles distant. Being nearly horizontal, it\r\ncrops out, as the river descends, at a continually increasing, but never\r\nat an inconvenient, height above the Monongahela. Besides this main\r\nseam, another layer of workable coal, six feet thick, breaks out on the\r\nslope of the hills at a greater height. Here almost every proprietor can\r\nopen a coal pit on his own land, and the stratification being very\r\nregular, he may calculate with precision the depth at which coal may be\r\nwon.\r\n\r\nOne of the most remarkable collieries in the world is that of Maunch\r\nChunk (or the Bear Mountain) in Pennsylvania, where an enormous bed of\r\nanthracitic coal, nearly sixty feet thick, and probably caused by the\r\ndoubling back of a twenty-eight feet seam upon itself, is quarried in\r\nthe open air; the overlying sandstone, forty feet thick, having been\r\nremoved bodily from the top of the hill, which, to use the miners’\r\nexpression, has been ‘scalped.’\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER XXXIII.\r\n                         BITUMINOUS SUBSTANCES.\r\n\r\nFormation of Petroleum—Enormous Production of the Pennsylvanian Wells—\r\n  Asphalte used by the Ancients—Asphalte Pavements—The Pitch Lake of\r\n  Trinidad—Jet—Its Manufacture in Whitby.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe class of bituminous minerals exhibits a long series of inflammable\r\nsubstances, which are supposed to be derived from the decomposition of\r\norganic matter in the rocks containing them. Some (Petroleum—Rock-\r\nnaphtha) issue in a fluid state from the earth, while others pass by\r\ninsensible gradations from petroleum into pittasphalte or maltha (viscid\r\nbitumen), and the latter as insensibly into the solid form of asphalte.\r\nCertain bitumens, again, differ but slightly in composition from\r\nbituminous coals, so that it is, in reality, very difficult to draw a\r\ndecided line between them. Hence it is highly probable that in petroleum\r\nwe see the product of a primeval vegetation which, under the influence\r\nof chemical change and heat, has partly assumed a liquid form, and\r\noozing from the deep-seated strata in which it was confined by\r\nterrestrial revolution, now permeates the superficial rocks, or exists\r\ncollected in subterranean cavities, whence it issues in jets and\r\nfountains whenever an outlet is made by boring.\r\n\r\nPetroleum springs have been known for many ages in Burmah, where there\r\nare about one hundred wells from one hundred and eighty to three hundred\r\nand six feet deep, each lined with horizontal tubes, but not all now\r\nworked; at Baku, in the neighbourhood of the holy fires, already\r\nmentioned; near the village of Amiano, in Parma, whence enough was\r\nformerly obtained to light the streets of Genoa; at Zante, one of the\r\nIonian islands, which has furnished oil for more than two thousand\r\nyears, its petroleum spring having been mentioned by Herodotus; at\r\nAgrigentum, in Sicily, which, according to Pliny, furnished a mineral\r\noil that was collected and used for burning in lamps; on the banks of\r\nthe Kuban, and many other localities; but it is only since the discovery\r\nof the immense sources of supply in the north-eastern States of America\r\nand in Canada that petroleum has become not only an article of the\r\ngreatest commercial importance, but a blessing to millions in all parts\r\nof the world. It gladdens the long winter evenings of the Icelandic\r\npeasant, and enlivens the hut of the Australian settler; it has found\r\nits way into the remotest glens of the Alps, and to the distant sea-\r\nports of China. No wonder that its economical and cheerful light has\r\ncaused its consumption to increase with a rapidity almost without a\r\nprecedent in the annals of commerce. Though scarcely ten years have\r\npassed since the American wells first began to pour forth their streams\r\nof oil, no less than 670,000,000 gallons were exported in 1866 from the\r\nports of Philadelphia and New York. One-third of this enormous quantity\r\nfound its way to England; one-fifth to the port of Antwerp, its chief\r\nstaple place for Western Germany and the North of France; the remainder\r\nwas distributed among all the sea-ports of the world from Hamburg to\r\nHong Kong, and from the Cape to Valparaiso. When we reflect that this\r\namazing mass of liquid bitumen, which formed the cargo of no less than\r\nseven hundred and thirty-one large vessels, must necessarily be\r\nincreased from year to year to meet a constantly increasing demand, it\r\nmight almost be feared that, in spite of the prodigality of nature, its\r\nsubterranean reservoirs must one day be exhausted.\r\n\r\nAsphalte, a mineral pitch of a deep black colour and a conchoidal\r\nbrilliant fracture, is frequently found swimming on the surface of the\r\nLake Asphaltites, or Dead Sea, in Judæa, which receives its name from\r\nthe circumstance. It also occurs in many parts of Egypt, where it was\r\nused for embalming. The ancients also frequently employed it, combined\r\nwith lime, in their buildings. Not only do we find the ruined walls of\r\ntemples and palaces in the East with the stones cemented with this\r\nmaterial, but some of the old Roman castles in this country are found to\r\nhold bitumen in the cement by which their stones are secured.\r\n\r\n‘It is a remarkable fact,’ says the late Dr. Ure, ‘that the substance\r\nthus employed in the earliest constructions upon record, should for so\r\nmany thousand years have fallen well-nigh into disuse among civilised\r\nnations; for there is certainly no class of minerals so well fitted as\r\nthe bituminous, by their plasticity, fusibility, tenacity, adhesiveness\r\nto surfaces, impenetrability by water, and unchangeableness in the\r\natmosphere, to enter into the composition of terraces, foot pavements,\r\nroofs, and every kind of hydraulic work. Bitumen, combined with\r\ncalcareous earth, forms a compact semi-elastic solid, which is not\r\nliable to suffer injury by the greatest alternations of frost and thaw,\r\nwhich often disintegrate in a few years the hardest stone, nor can it be\r\nground to dust and worn away by the attrition of the feet of men and\r\nanimals, as sandstone, flags, and even blocks of granite are. An\r\nasphalte pavement rightly tempered in tenacity, solidity, and\r\nelasticity, seems to be incapable of suffering abrasion in the most\r\ncrowded thoroughfares; a fact exemplified of late in a few places in\r\nLondon, but much more extensively and for a much longer time in Paris.’\r\nMany of the asphalte pavements made in England have, indeed, proved\r\nfailures; but as the proper proportions of the respective ingredients\r\nmay not have been maintained, further trials are advisable. At present,\r\nalthough bitumen is employed, and with seeming advantage, as a cement\r\nbetween paving-stones, its use in the formation of foot pavement has\r\nbeen confined within narrow limits.\r\n\r\nIn Europe, the most extensive mine of asphaltic rock is undoubtedly that\r\nof the Val de Travers in the canton of Neufchâtel; but the most\r\nremarkable deposit of bitumen in the world is the celebrated Great Pitch\r\nLake in the island of Trinidad. With regard to its formation, Sir\r\nCharles Lyell remarks that the Orinoco, which discharges its vast volume\r\nof water right opposite to the island, has for ages been rolling down\r\ngreat quantities of woody and vegetable bodies into the surrounding sea,\r\nwhere, by the influence of currents and eddies, they may be arrested and\r\naccumulated in particular places. The frequent occurrence of earthquakes\r\nand other indications of volcanic action in these parts lends\r\ncountenance to the opinion that these vegetable substances may have\r\nundergone, by the agency of subterranean fire, those transformations or\r\nchemical changes which produce petroleum; and this may, by the same\r\ncauses, be forced up to the surface, where, by exposure to the air, it\r\nbecomes inspissated, and forms the different varieties of pure and\r\nearthy pitch or asphaltum so abundant in the island. The Pitch Lake is a\r\nmile and a half in circumference; the bitumen is solid and cold near the\r\nshores, but gradually increases in temperature and softness towards the\r\ncentre, where it is boiling. The solidified bitumen appears as if it had\r\ncooled as the surface boiled in large bubbles. The ascent from the lake\r\nto the sea, a distance of three-quarters of a mile, is covered with a\r\nhardened pitch, on which trees and vegetables flourish, and the best\r\npine-apples in the West Indies, called black pines, grow wild. As the\r\nTrinidad pitch has been found by chemical analysis to be an excellent\r\nmaterial for the making of gas, it will probably become an important\r\narticle of commerce. The wonder is that it has been so long neglected.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE PITCH LAKE, TRINIDAD. WEST INDIES. (_From an Original\r\nSketch._)]\r\n\r\nThough Jet is frequently considered to be wood in a high state of\r\nbituminisation, yet the fact that we find this beautiful substance\r\nsurrounding fossils, and casing adventitious masses of stone, seems to\r\nshow that a liquid, or, at all events, a plastic condition must at one\r\ntime have prevailed in its formation. This opinion is further\r\nstrengthened by the circumstance that petroleum strongly impregnates the\r\nrock in which it is found, giving out a strong odour when it is exposed\r\nto the air.\r\n\r\nJet occurs chiefly in the neighbourhood of Whitby in Yorkshire, the\r\nestates of Lord Mulgrave being especially productive. The jet miner\r\nsearches with great care the slaty rocks, and finding the jet spread\r\nout, often in extreme thinness, between the laminations of the rock, he\r\nfollows it with great care, and is frequently rewarded by its thickening\r\nout to two or three inches.\r\n\r\nThe art of working jet is of very ancient date in this country, for the\r\nRomans certainly employed it for ornamental purposes, and probably found\r\nit in use among the Britons whom they conquered. Lionel Charlton, in the\r\n‘History of Whitby,’ says that in one of the Roman tumuli, lying close\r\nto the jaw-bone, he found the earring of a lady having the form of a\r\nheart, with a hole in the upper end for suspension from the ear. There\r\nexists no doubt that, when the Abbey of Whitby was the seat of learning\r\nand the resort of pilgrims, jet-rosaries and crosses were common. The\r\nmanufacture was carried on till the time of Elizabeth, when it seems to\r\nhave ceased suddenly, and was not resumed till the year 1800, when\r\nRobert Jefferson, a painter, and John Carter made beads and crosses with\r\nfiles and knives. A stranger coming to Whitby, and seeing them working\r\nin this rude way, advised them to try to turn it; they followed his\r\nadvice, and found it answer. Several more then joined them, and the\r\ntrade has been gradually increasing since; so that at present the total\r\nannual value of the mourning ornaments made at Whitby and Scarborough\r\namounts to no less than 125,000_l._ About 250 men and boys are employed\r\nin searching for jet, and between 600 and 700 are engaged in its\r\nmanufacture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXXIV.\r\n                                 SALT.\r\n\r\nGeological Position of Rock Salt—Mines of Northwich—Their immense\r\n  Excavations—Droitwich and Stoke—Wieliczka—Berchtesgaden and\r\n  Reichenhall—Admirable Machinery—Stassfurt—Processes employed in the\r\n  Manufacture of Salt—Origin of Rock-salt Deposits.\r\n\r\n\r\nCommon salt is so necessary to man, and of such vast importance to the\r\nmanufacturer and agriculturist, that the processes by which it is\r\nobtained are justly reckoned among the chief branches of industry.\r\n\r\nIn many of the warmer countries of the globe it is procured simply by\r\nthe evaporation of sea-water in shallow lagoons; in others, it gushes\r\nforth in briny springs, or occurs in inland lakes, pools, and marshes,\r\nor is extracted in the solid form of rock-salt from the bosom of the\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nThe geological position of rock-salt is very variable; it is found in\r\nall sedimentary formations, and is generally interstratified with\r\ngypsum, and associated with beds of clay. In England its chief deposits\r\noccur in the new red sandstone in the region around Northwich, in\r\nCheshire. They consist of two beds, which are not less than one hundred\r\nfeet thick, and are supposed to constitute large insulated masses about\r\na mile and a half long and nearly 1,300 yards broad. The uppermost bed\r\noccurs at seventy-five feet beneath the surface, and is separated from\r\nthe lower mass by layers of indurated clay, thirty-one and a half feet\r\nthick, with veins of rock-salt running between them. Hitherto only the\r\nlower bed has been worked, for the upper deposits are of inferior\r\npurity. These valuable mines were accidentally discovered in 1670 during\r\nan unsuccessful sinking for coal; and as ever since that time they have\r\nfurnished a constantly increasing quantity of salt, amounting during the\r\nlast few years to more than 800,000 tons, the vastness of the\r\nexcavations may easily be imagined. To support the roof, which is about\r\ntwenty feet above the floor, and extends in some cases over several\r\nacres, huge pillars not less than fifteen feet thick have been left\r\nstanding at irregular intervals, thus forming immense rows of galleries,\r\nwhich even when illuminated by thousands of lights are lost in a dim and\r\nendless perspective, which may well remind the spectator of the fabled\r\nHall of Eblis.\r\n\r\nAs the salt is detached from the rock by blasting, the grandeur of the\r\nscene is not a little heightened by the frequent explosions re-echoing\r\nthrough the spacious vaults, and booming like thunder from some dark and\r\ndistant gallery. For the transport of the salt underground, the roomy\r\npassages are traversed in every direction by tram-roads, on which\r\nwaggons drawn by horses easily convey it from the place of extraction to\r\nthe bottom of the shaft. The chief part of the Cheshire salt (both\r\nfossil and rock) manufactured is sent by the river Weever to Liverpool.\r\nAs it is rarely found of sufficient purity for immediate use, it is\r\nfirst dissolved in water, and afterwards reduced to a crystalline state\r\nby evaporating the solution. The necessary coals are mostly brought by\r\ncanal from the neighbourhood of St. Helens, and salt taken as a return\r\nfreight; so that, as in a clock-work where one wheel catches into\r\nanother, nothing is wanting to render its manufacture as economical as\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nAmong the mineral treasures which nature has so prodigally bestowed upon\r\nGreat Britain, the salt-mines of Cheshire hold a conspicuous rank, as\r\nthey not only provide chiefly for our own vast consumption, but also for\r\nthat of many other countries. In 1864 the salt exports amounted to\r\n596,063 tons, the total value being 281,443_l._ About one-third of this\r\nimmense quantity (183,097 tons) found its way to the British East\r\nIndies, 72,201 tons to Russia, and 86,208 tons to the United States.\r\n\r\nNext in importance to the Cheshire mines are the brine-pits of Droitwich\r\nand Stoke, in Worcestershire, the former of which are said to have been\r\nworked in the time of the Romans, and now chiefly supply the London\r\nmarket. In 1865 their produce amounted to 185,000 tons, of which about\r\n40,000 were exported.\r\n\r\nAt Droitwich the borings are only 175 feet deep, and so abundant is the\r\nsupply of brine that, if the pumps cease working, it speedily rises to\r\nwithin nine feet of the surface, and if left unremoved, soon overflows.\r\n\r\nThe most renowned salt-mines on the continent of Europe are undoubtedly\r\nthose of Wieliczka, a small town of about 6,000 inhabitants, situated to\r\nthe south of Cracow, in a fruitful valley on the northern borders of the\r\nCarpathian mountains. ‘After descending 210 feet,’ says Mr. Bayard\r\nTaylor, an American traveller who visited them a few years ago, ‘we saw\r\nthe first veins of rock-salt in a bed of clay and crumbled sandstone.\r\nThirty feet more, and we were in a world of salt. Level galleries\r\nbranched off from the foot of the staircase; overhead, a ceiling of\r\nsolid salt, under foot a floor of salt, and on either side gray walls of\r\nsalt, sparkling here and there with minute crystals. Lights glimmered\r\nahead, and on turning a corner we came upon a gang of workmen, some\r\nhacking away at the solid floor, others trundling wheelbarrows full of\r\nthe precious cubes. Here was the chapel of St. Anthony—the oldest in the\r\nmines—a Byzantine excavation, supported by columns, with altar,\r\ncrucifix, and life-size statues of saints, apparently in black marble,\r\nbut all as salt as Lot’s wife, as I discovered by putting my tongue to\r\nthe nose of John the Baptist. The humid air of this upper story of the\r\nmines has damaged some of the saints. Francis, especially, is running\r\naway like a dip candle, and all of his head is gone except his chin. The\r\nlimbs of Joseph are dropping off as if he had the Norwegian leprosy, and\r\nLawrence has deeper scars than his gridiron could have made, running up\r\nand down his back. A Bengal light, burnt at the altar, brought into\r\nsudden life this strange temple, which presently vanished into utter\r\ndarkness, as if it had never been.\r\n\r\n‘I cannot follow, step by step, our journey of two hours through the\r\nlabyrinths of this wonderful mine. It is a bewildering maze of\r\ngalleries, grand halls, staircases, and vaulted chambers, where one soon\r\nloses all sense of distance or direction, and drifts along blindly in\r\nthe wake of his conductor. Everything was solid salt except where great\r\npiers of hewn logs had been built up to support some threatening roof,\r\nor vast chasms, left in quarrying, had been bridged across. As we\r\ndescended to lower regions, the air became more dry and agreeable, and\r\nthe saline walls more pure and brilliant. One hall, 108 feet in length,\r\nresembled a Grecian theatre, the traces of blocks taken out in regular\r\nlayers representing the seats for the spectators. Out of this single\r\nhall 1,000,000 cwt. of salt had been taken, or enough to supply the\r\n40,000,000 inhabitants of Austria for one year.\r\n\r\n‘Two obelisks of salt commemorated the visit of Francis I. and his\r\nEmpress in another spacious, irregular vault, through which we passed by\r\nmeans of a wooden bridge, resting on piers of the crystalline rock.\r\nAfter we had descended to the bottom of this chamber, a boy ran along\r\nthe bridge above with a burning Bengal-light, throwing flashes of blue\r\nlustre on the obelisks, on the scarred walls, vast arches, the entrances\r\nto deeper halls, and the far roof, fretted with the picks of the\r\nworkmen. The effect was truly magical. Presently we entered another and\r\nloftier chamber, yawning downwards like the mouth of hell, with\r\ncavernous tunnels opening out of the further end. In these tunnels the\r\nworkmen, half naked, with torches in their hands, wild cries, fireworks,\r\nand the firing of guns (which here so reverberates in the imprisoned air\r\nthat one can feel every wave of sound), give a rough representation of\r\nthe infernal regions, for the benefit of the crowned heads who visit the\r\nmines. A little further, we struck upon a lake four fathoms deep, upon\r\nwhich we embarked in a heavy, square boat, and entered a gloomy tunnel,\r\nover the entrance of which was inscribed (in salt letters) “Good luck to\r\nyou!” Midway in the tunnel, the halls at either ends were suddenly\r\nilluminated, and a crash, as of a hundred cannon bellowing through the\r\nhollow vaults, shook the air and water in such wise that our boat had\r\nnot ceased trembling when we landed in the further hall. A tablet\r\ninscribed “Heartily welcome!” saluted us on landing. Finally, at the\r\ndepth of 450 feet, our journey ceased, although we were but half way to\r\nthe bottom. The remainder is a wilderness of shafts, galleries, and\r\nsmaller chambers, the extent of which we could only conjecture. We then\r\nreturned through scores of tortuous passages to some vaults, where a lot\r\nof gnomes, naked to the hips, were busy with pick, mallet, and wedge,\r\nblocking out and separating the solid pavement. The process is quite\r\nprimitive, scarcely differing from that of the ancient Egyptians in\r\nquarrying granite. The blocks are first marked out on the surface by a\r\nseries of grooves; one side is then deepened to the required thickness,\r\nand wedges being inserted under the block, it is soon split off.\r\n\r\n‘The number of workmen employed in the mines is 1,500, all of whom\r\nbelong to the ‘upper crust,’—that is, they live on the outside of the\r\nworld. They are divided into gangs, and relieve each other every six\r\nhours. Each gang quarries out, on an average, a little more than 1,000\r\ncwt. of salt in that space of time, making the annual yield 1,500,000\r\ncwt.!\r\n\r\n‘The men we saw were fine, muscular, healthy-looking fellows; and the\r\nofficer, in answer to my questions, stated that their sanitary condition\r\nwas quite equal to that of field labourers. He explicitly denied the\r\nridiculous story of men having been born in these mines, and having gone\r\nthrough life without ever mounting to the upper world.’\r\n\r\nAs far as explored, the salt-bed occupies a space of 9,000 feet in\r\nlength and 4,000 in width, and consists of five successive stages or\r\n_stockwerke_, separated from each other by intervening strata of from\r\n100 to 150 feet in thickness, and reaching to a depth of 1,500 feet.\r\nNotwithstanding the immense amount of salt already quarried from this\r\nwonderful deposit, which, according to authentic records, has been\r\nworked ever since the twelfth century, and perhaps even much earlier, it\r\nis estimated that, at the present rate of exploitation, the known supply\r\ncannot be exhausted under 300 years.\r\n\r\nIt is a remarkable circumstance that sources of sweet water are found in\r\nthe mines in close proximity to the salt, a circumstance which is owing\r\nto the latter not forming a continuous stratum, but being imbedded in\r\nlarge nests or insular masses in the tertiary clay of the mountain, so\r\nthat in several places the water filtering from the top is able to gush\r\nforth in the subterranean galleries without any saline admixture.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1868 a serious accident happened to the mines of\r\nWieliczka, which at one time was supposed to threaten their total\r\ndestruction. In the hope of discovering valuable potash salts, such as\r\noccur at Stassfurt, in the vicinity of the rock-salt, a boring was\r\nimprudently attempted at a great depth, through a contiguous aquiferous\r\nstratum, and the consequence was that, instead of meeting with the\r\nexpected result, a powerful spring was tapped, which, pouring forth an\r\nimmense volume of water, filled the lower galleries. The inhabitants of\r\nthe village of Wieliczka, which is situated above the mines, were\r\nterrified. They not only feared for the ruin of the mine, which afforded\r\nthem their chief means of subsistence, but dreaded also the falling in\r\nof their houses, in consequence of the melting of the salt-pillars which\r\nupheld the flooded galleries.\r\n\r\nFortunately their fears proved to be exaggerated, as the inundation,\r\nwhich remained confined to the lower galleries, is now being rapidly\r\nbrought under by means of powerful steam pumps, and measures have been\r\ntaken for blocking up the spring. Even supposing the water to have\r\ncontinued pouring in with undiminished force, and without any effort\r\nbeing made to drain it off, the excavations are so vast that it would\r\nhave taken many years to fill them.\r\n\r\nBesides the mines of Wieliczka, Austria possesses many other\r\nconsiderable deposits of rock-salt in Gallicia (Bochnia), Hungary, and\r\nTransylvania. In Salzburg (Ischl, Halstadt Hall), Tyrol, and the\r\nneighbouring mines of Berchtesgaden, in Bavaria, the salt does not occur\r\nin large solid masses, fit to be at once extracted from the bosom of the\r\nearth, but imbues masses of gypsum and anhydrite, which become quite\r\nlight and porous when the salt has been removed by water. As it would be\r\ntoo expensive to remove this compound, an ingenious method has been\r\ncontrived for introducing water into the mines from above, and drawing\r\nit off again through an adit or lower gallery as soon as it is saturated\r\nwith salt.\r\n\r\nThe brine thus obtained at Berchtesgaden is then conveyed, by means of\r\npipes or conduits, to Reichenhall and Rosenhain, where the necessary\r\nfuel for its evaporation is near at hand. The distance from\r\nBerchtesgaden to Rosenhain is no less than thirty leagues; and between\r\nboth places many high mountains, steep rocks, and narrow gorges\r\nintervene. The works which lead the brine over this distance, and\r\nthrough all these natural obstacles, may therefore justly be considered\r\nas a masterpiece of mechanical skill. As the pipes must often ascend\r\nmountains, the highest elevation above the pit being 1,218 feet, and\r\nthen again slant down into ravines; as in many parts rocks had to be\r\nlevelled and forests cut down for the purpose of laying them, and as\r\nthey are subject to frequent damage in a severe climate, it may easily\r\nbe imagined that the greatest engineering power was required for the\r\nexecution of so grand a work.\r\n\r\nHydraulic machines serve to raise the brine over the mountains, and the\r\nwater-power of the rivulets descending from the heights is used for\r\nforcing it upwards. The contrivance is so admirable that the small\r\nmachine at Berchtesgaden raises 270 cwt. of brine to a height of 311\r\nfeet by means of an equal weight of water descending from a height of\r\n375 feet. In some parts the tubes of this colossal duct run along the\r\nhigh road, in others tunnels have been pierced to shorten the distance.\r\n\r\nThus the Alpine rock-salt requires much ingenuity to be rendered\r\nproductive, while in other parts we find rock-salt cropping out on the\r\nsurface of the earth, so as to be very easily worked. The soil of many\r\nextensive wastes in Asia and Africa is covered and impregnated with\r\nsalt, which has never been inclosed by superimposed deposits. Near Lake\r\nOroomiah, in Persia, it forms hills and extensive plains, and it abounds\r\nin the neighbourhood of the Caspian Sea.\r\n\r\nIn the valley of Cardona in the Pyrenees two thick masses of rock-salt,\r\napparently united at their bases, make their appearance on one of the\r\nslopes of the hill. One of the beds, or rather masses, has been worked,\r\nand measures about 130 yards by 250, but its depth has not been\r\ndetermined. It consists of salt in a laminated condition and with\r\nconfused crystallisation. That part which is exposed is composed of\r\neight beds, nearly horizontal, and having a total thickness of fifteen\r\nfeet, but the beds are separated from one another by red and variegated\r\nmarls and gypsum. The second mass not worked appears to be unstratified,\r\nbut in other respects resembles the former; and this portion, where it\r\nhas been exposed to the action of the weather, is steeply scarped and\r\nbristles with needlelike points, so that its appearance has been\r\ncompared to that of a glacier.\r\n\r\nThe rock-salt deposit of Ilezk, about fifty miles to the south of\r\nOrenburg, in Russia, is still more remarkable. On the sides of a crater-\r\nlike pit, which has been dug into the mass where it most nearly\r\napproaches the surface, the rock-salt is seen standing in perpendicular\r\nwalls. On the west side of the gap a convenient staircase leads to the\r\nbottom. The salt is hewn in large square blocks, which are afterwards\r\nsawn into smaller pieces of eighty-five pounds. The regular annual\r\nproduce is fixed by Government at 700,000 pud, or about 10,000 tons, of\r\nwhich part is furnished _gratuitously_ to the neighbouring Kirghise\r\nhordes, who no doubt are made to pay dearly for their salt in some other\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\nThe labours in the mine are only carried on during the summer, and begin\r\nby pumping out the water which has settled at the bottom of the pit from\r\nthe melting snow; while the transport to the next river by means of\r\nsledges takes place during the winter. Were this mine situated in a less\r\nbarbarous or more accessible country, it might easily rival, or even\r\nsurpass, the produce of Cheshire. To the south of the pit, where the\r\nregular mining operations, such as they are, take place, a great number\r\nof old pits or holes may be seen, in which the Cossacks, Baschkirs, and\r\nKirghise used to provide themselves with salt before Government\r\nundertook the regular working of the mine in 1754. These pits, some of\r\nwhich are sixty feet square, and from six to eight feet deep, are\r\ngenerally full of a saturated brine of a brownish colour, and are made\r\nuse of for bathing by the Kirghise, who justly consider them as an\r\nexcellent remedy for many diseases.\r\n\r\nBefore 1856 all the salt produced in Prussia was obtained from brine\r\nsprings, but since that time enormous beds of rock-salt have been\r\ndiscovered in various parts of the kingdom. Those of Stassfurt, near\r\nMagdeburg, produced 2,256,000 cwt. in 1866, part of which was exported\r\ninto foreign countries, through the ports of Lubeck and Hamburg. But the\r\nmines of Stassfurt, besides rock-salt, contain also an inexhaustible\r\nquantity of highly valuable potash salts, which are largely used for\r\nagricultural purposes, and supply the wants of the numerous chemical\r\nmanufactories which have rapidly converted an obscure hamlet into a\r\nflourishing seat of industry. At Speerenberg, about twenty miles to the\r\nsouth of Berlin, the earth-borer has pierced through an enormous deposit\r\nof rock-salt, more than two thousand feet thick, and at Segeberg, in the\r\nprovince of Sleswig-Holstein, a shaft is now being sunk into a rich bed\r\nof rock-salt, recently discovered.\r\n\r\nThe method of preparing the rock-salt, and the processes employed in\r\nmanufacturing salt from brine springs, are nearly the same in all salt-\r\nworks. The first process is to obtain a proper strength of brine, either\r\nby saturating fresh water with the salt that has been brought up from\r\nthe mine, or pumping up the salt water from springs that have become\r\nsaturated by passing through saliferous beds. The brine obtained in a\r\nclear state is put into evaporating pans and brought as quickly as\r\npossible to a boiling heat (in the case of strong brine 226° F.), when a\r\nskin is formed on the surface, consisting chiefly of impurities. This is\r\ntaken off, and either thrown away or used for agricultural purposes, and\r\nthe first crystals which form are likewise raked away and thrown aside\r\nas of little value. The heat is then kept up to the boiling point for\r\nabout eight hours, during which time evaporation goes on steadily, the\r\nliquid gradually diminishing, and the salt being deposited; it is then\r\nraked out, put into moulds, and placed in a drying stove, to render it\r\nperfectly dry and ready for sale.\r\n\r\nWhen salt is to be prepared from the weak brines which are of common\r\noccurrence in France and Germany, the brine is concentrated by natural\r\nevaporation previous to the more costly application of artificial heat.\r\nHaving been first raised by pumps, it is then allowed to trickle in a\r\ncontinuous stream down the surface of bundles of thorns exposed to the\r\nsun and wind, and built up in regular walls between parallel wooden\r\nframes. These evaporating works (_Gradirwerke_ or graduation-houses) are\r\nfrequently of an immense extent. At Salza, near Schönebeck, for\r\ninstance, the graduation-house is 5,817 feet long, the thorn walls are\r\nfrom 33 to 52 feet high in different parts, and present a total surface\r\nof 25,000 feet. According to the weakness of the brine it must be the\r\nmore frequently pumped up and made to flow down repeatedly over the\r\nthorns in different compartments of the building. An immense quantity of\r\nfuel is saved by this economical mode of evaporation.\r\n\r\nThe origin of rock-salt deposits is one of the most interesting\r\ngeological questions. According to some authorities, they were the\r\nresult of igneous agency, while others are of opinion that in every case\r\nthey have been deposited from solution in water. Their usual occurrence\r\nin lenticular or irregularly-shaped beds, having a great horizontal\r\nextension, favours the aqueous theory, for masses protruded upwards, or\r\nsublimated by volcanic power, are generally found to occupy vertical\r\nfissures. To account for their formation we must suppose a sea such as\r\nthe Mediterranean cut off by an elevation of the land at its mouth from\r\nits previous communication with the ocean, and gradually losing more\r\nwater by evaporation than it receives by rain and rivers. As thus the\r\namount of salt which it holds dissolved increases, deposits of rock-salt\r\nwill ultimately form at the bottom of its deepest parts, and subsequent\r\nchanges in the earth’s surface may then either conceal them under\r\nsuperincumbent strata, as at Northwich, or leave them exposed, as in\r\nmany of the African or Asiatic wastes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXXV.\r\n                                SULPHUR.\r\n\r\nSulphur Mines of Sicily—Conflagration of a Sulphur Mine—The Solfataras\r\n  of Krisuvick—Iwogasima in Japan—Solfatara of Puzzuoli—Crater of\r\n  Teneriffe—Alaghez—Büdöshegy in Transylvania—Sulphur from the Throat of\r\n  Popocatepetl—Sulphurous Springs—Pyrites—Mines of San Domingos in\r\n  Portugal—The Baron of Pommorão.\r\n\r\n\r\nThough in every volcanic region of the globe sulphurous exhalations\r\narise from a great number of craters or solfataras, yet sulphur is but\r\nrarely found in sufficient quantities to remunerate the miner’s toil. In\r\nthis respect the island of Sicily is unrivalled, for no other country\r\npossesses such masses of this valuable, and in many cases indispensable,\r\nmineral.\r\n\r\nThe numerous sulphur pits of Sicily, which occur in crevices or hollows\r\nover a space of 150 geographical miles, are situated chiefly in the\r\nsouthern part of the island, in the districts between the sea-border of\r\nthe province of Girgenti and the mountains of Etna, Mannaro, Castro\r\nGiovanni, and Catolica. They are no doubt the produce of a vast volcanic\r\naction which took place about the beginning of the tertiary period, when\r\nthe sulphurous fumes, rising through countless clefts or fumaroles from\r\nthe mysterious furnaces of the deep, condensed in the chalk and clay\r\ngrounds of the superficial strata.\r\n\r\nIn former times, as long as the chief use of sulphur was confined to the\r\nfabrication of gunpowder, its production was comparatively\r\ninsignificant; but since the manufacture of sulphuric acid has become a\r\nbranch of industry of continually increasing importance, sulphur, the\r\ningredient necessary to its formation, has considerably risen in value,\r\nand now constitutes the chief article of Sicilian exportation.\r\n\r\nGirgenti, the most important town on the south coast of the island,\r\nthough its dirty miserable streets and its 15,000 inhabitants form a\r\nmelancholy contrast to the wealth and luxury of ancient Agrigentum,\r\nwithin whose lofty walls a population of 800,000 souls is said to have\r\nexisted, owes to the increase of the sulphur trade the slight dawn of\r\nprosperity which has enlivened it during these latter years.\r\n\r\nAll the sulphur-pits in the south-west of the island send their produce\r\nto the port of Girgenti, and on every road one meets with long files of\r\nmules and asses loaded with sacks of sulphur.\r\n\r\nThe grape disease, against which this mineral is everywhere used in\r\nFrance and Italy as the only successful remedy, has given a new impulse\r\nto the sulphur trade by raising the price to about three times its\r\nformer value. The merchants of Girgenti did not neglect this opportunity\r\nfor making their fortunes, for as soon as the grape disease became a\r\nnational calamity for the chief wine-producing countries, they bought up\r\nlarge tracts of sulphur-grounds, and thus acquired considerable wealth.\r\n\r\nA visit paid by Dr. Häckel[67] in 1859 to the sulphur pits near Girgenti\r\nproves that mining operations in Sicily are still in the primitive\r\ncondition described by all former travellers. Not even our commonest\r\nimprovements are known; the pickaxe and the spade are almost the only\r\nimplements employed, and with these the earth is excavated in the most\r\nslovenly manner, wherever a vein promises to be productive. The\r\nmaterials thus loosened from the rock are carried out of the mine in\r\nbaskets and thrown into large heaps, from which the sulphur is extracted\r\nin the following wasteful manner. The conical mounds are covered with a\r\nmantle of moist clay, in which some openings are left for the emission\r\nof the smoke, and set fire to at the bottom. The melted sulphur collects\r\nin grooves or channels, and flows into square forms, where it congeals\r\ninto a solid mass. This method, which is said to have been first\r\nintroduced by the Saracens, causes, of course, a great loss of sulphur;\r\nbut distilling ovens heated by coal have been found too expensive to\r\nanswer. Dr. Häckel traversed one of the longest excavations, which was\r\nsometimes so narrow that he could only with difficulty pass, and then\r\nexpanded into high vaults whose roof was ornamented with beautiful\r\ncrystals of celestine and gypsum. The workmen were completely naked, on\r\naccount of the oppressive heat which reigns in these pits; and their\r\ndark brown skins, sprinkled with light yellow sulphur dust, gave them a\r\nvery strange and savage appearance. Most of the inhabitants of Girgenti\r\nare at present employed in the sulphur mines, and comparatively few are\r\nengaged in cultivating the beautiful gardens and fields that extend from\r\nthe foot of the town to the sea, and occupy the site where once the\r\nancient city of Agrigentum rose from the shore to the terraced hills\r\nwhich are still crowned with the ruins of her colossal temples.\r\n\r\nFootnote 67:\r\n\r\n  ‘Zeitschrift für allgemeine Erdkunde,’ No. 84, Juni, 1860.\r\n\r\nOn an average, the sulphur-ores of Sicily yield about sixteen per cent.\r\nof brimstone, and the quantity annually produced has increased from\r\n94,985 tons in 1851 to 184,173 tons in 1866. Besides Girgenti, the chief\r\nports from which sulphur is exported are those of Licata, Terranova,\r\nSiculiana, Palermo, Messina, and Catania.\r\n\r\nOne of the most remarkable events in the history of Sicilian sulphur\r\nmines occurred during the last century in the solfatara of Sommatino.\r\nThis celebrated pit, which is situated on the precipitous right bank of\r\nthe Salso Valley, took fire in 1787, through the negligence of the\r\nworkmen, and as may easily be imagined from the inflammable nature of\r\nthe materials, the conflagration caused the complete abandonment of the\r\npit. After two years, however, during which the fire raged incessantly,\r\nthe mountain suddenly burst asunder on its south-eastern flank, and a\r\nstream of melted sulphur, gushing forth from the cleft, precipitated\r\nitself into the neighbouring river. This phenomenon, which was evidently\r\ncaused by Nature having performed on a vast scale an operation similar\r\nto that by which the sulphur is usually extracted from the ore, produced\r\na mass of the purest brimstone, amounting to more than 40,000 tons, so\r\nthat the owners of the pit, who had given up their property as totally\r\nlost, became enriched by the very circumstance which had seemed to\r\nmenace them with utter ruin.\r\n\r\nNext to the sulphur mines of Sicily, those of Teruel and Lorca, in\r\nSpain, which in 1862 furnished 12,639 tons, are the most considerable in\r\nEurope. The mines of Perticara di Talamella, in Italy, annually yield\r\nabout 4,000 tons; and the Austrian sulphur pits of Swoszowice, near\r\nCracovia, and of Radoboy, in Croatia, produced 1,867 tons in 1865.\r\n\r\nIn all these mines the sulphur has been deposited or condensed in times\r\nlong past, undoubtedly in the same manner as it is formed in the\r\nsolfataras of the present day, where the decomposition of the volanic\r\ngases on reaching the atmosphere causes the precipitation of sulphur.\r\n\r\nMost of these still active solfataras are unproductive in a commercial\r\nsense, either from their inaccessible position in the crater basins of\r\nenormous volcanoes, or from their situation in remote deserts, or from\r\nthe small quantities of the mineral forming on their surface.\r\n\r\nThe solfataras of Krisuvick in Iceland, for instance, are separated from\r\nthe nearest ports by such rugged lava-fields as to render the cost of\r\ntransport an almost insurmountable obstacle to their being worked with\r\nprofit. But though undeserving of the mercantile speculator’s attention,\r\nthese northern sulphur pits rank among the most striking natural wonders\r\nof Iceland.[68]\r\n\r\nFootnote 68:\r\n\r\n  ‘The Polar World,’ p. 52.\r\n\r\nThe remote solfataras of Japan afford a more abundant supply. ‘The\r\nsulphur,’ says Kämpfer, in his history of that singular country, ‘is the\r\nproduce of a small island which, from the great quantity it affords of\r\nthis substance, is called “Iwogasima,” or the Sulphur Island. It is not\r\nabove a hundred years since the natives first ventured to explore that\r\ndesert spot, which, from the smoke rising from its surface, was\r\npreviously supposed to be the abode of demons. At length a bold\r\nadventurer obtained leave to visit the dreaded island. He chose fifty\r\nresolute men to accompany him on his hazardous expedition, and on\r\nlanding found, instead of the fiends he expected to encounter, a\r\nvolcanic soil, covered in many parts with thick deposits of sulphur, and\r\nemitting dense volumes of smoke from countless fumaroles. Ever since\r\nthat time the island yields a considerable revenue to the Prince of\r\nSatzuma.’\r\n\r\nOne of the most celebrated solfataras is that of Puzzuoli, near Naples.\r\nIt may be considered as a nearly extinguished crater, and appears, by\r\nthe accounts of Strabo and others, to have been before the Christian era\r\nin very much its present state, giving vent continually to aqueous\r\nvapours, together with sulphureous and muriatic acid gases, like those\r\nevolved by Vesuvius. This remarkable spot has attracted the attention of\r\nnaturalists and poets since the remotest antiquity, and Homer mentions\r\nit in his immortal narrative of the peregrinations of Ulysses. The\r\nprocess for the separation of the sulphur, which is condensed in\r\nconsiderable quantities amongst the gravel collected in the circle which\r\nforms the interior of the crater, is conducted in the following manner.\r\nThe mixture of sulphur and gravel is dug up and submitted to\r\ndistillation, to extract the sulphur; the gravel is then returned to its\r\noriginal place, and in the course of about thirty years is again so rich\r\nin sulphur as to serve for the same process once more.\r\n\r\n‘The crater of the Peak of Teneriffe,’ says Leopold von Buch, ‘is now\r\nbut an immense solfatara. The sulphureous vapours which escape from\r\nevery part of the vast cauldron, decompose the rock, convert it into\r\nwhite clay, and cover it in many places with beautiful crystals of\r\nsulphur. By this constant chemical action, the soil towards the centre\r\nof the crater has been rendered so soft that in many places great\r\ncaution is necessary to avoid sinking into the yielding mass, which has\r\na temperature higher than that of boiling water.’\r\n\r\nA remarkable sulphur formation occurs on the rocks surrounding the\r\ncrater of the volcano Alaghez, situated in Northern Armenia. The sulphur\r\nis precipitated in thick crusts on their walls, and as the summit of the\r\ncrater is inaccessible, the people of the neighbourhood, in order to\r\ncollect the sulphur, fire at it with musket balls, and pick up the\r\nfragments thus detached.\r\n\r\nClose beneath the summit of the Patuka, in Java, is a circular lake\r\nabout fifteen hundred feet in diameter. The borders are covered with a\r\nrich vegetation; the water is clear and colourless, but appears\r\nyellowish from the reflection of the sulphur which covers the whole\r\nbottom of the lake. In 1818 Reinwardt found in this piece of water an\r\nislet completely composed of sulphur.\r\n\r\nAfter the eruption of the Tashem Idjem, another Javanese volcano, in\r\n1796, such quantities of sulphur were formed that several hundred\r\nshiploads could be gathered and exported as the produce of this single\r\nvolcanic paroxysm.\r\n\r\nThe mountain Büdöshegy, in Transylvania, exhibits the remarkable\r\nphenomenon of sulphur caves. On entering one of these vast subterranean\r\ncrevices, incrustations of sulphur are seen to cover the lower part of\r\nthe walls; but respiration is still easy and free. On advancing a few\r\nsteps the air acquires a sharp acidulous taste, and the feet begin to\r\nfeel a warmth which gradually increases to an intolerable heat. On\r\nadvancing still further the lights are extinguished. A speedy retreat is\r\nnecessary, and imprudent visitors have been known to pay for their\r\ncuriosity with their lives.\r\n\r\nIn the island of Milo there are likewise numerous caverns the walls of\r\nwhich are incrusted with sulphur and alum. A visit to these grottoes,\r\nwhich annually yield about five hundred tons of pure sulphur, is not\r\nwithout danger from the suffocating fumes that issue from their\r\ncrevices.\r\n\r\nSome of the Arabian volcanoes also produce considerable quantities of\r\nsulphur, such as the Dufan, which is called Djebel-el-Kebril, or\r\n‘Sulphur Mountain’ by the Arabs, and is mentioned in the writings of\r\nHerodotus.\r\n\r\nThough the craters of volcanoes are generally almost inaccessible, yet\r\nhistory mentions a curious instance where the most extraordinary\r\nexertions were made for collecting sulphur above the regions of\r\nperpetual snow. During the wondrous campaign which ended in the\r\noverthrow of the empire of Montezuma, Cortez, being in want of powder,\r\nsent a party under Francisco Montaño, a cavalier of determined\r\nresolution, to gather sulphur from the smoking throat of Popocatepetl,\r\nwhich rises, with its silvery sheet of everlasting snow, to the height\r\nof 17,852 feet above the level of the sea. After traversing the lower\r\nregion, which was clothed with a dense forest, so thickly matted that in\r\nsome places it was scarcely possible to penetrate it, the track of the\r\nSpaniards opened on a black surface of glazed volcanic sand and of lava,\r\nthe broken fragments of which, arrested in its boiling process in a\r\nthousand fantastic forms, opposed continual impediments to their\r\nadvance. They now came to the limits of perpetual snow, where new\r\ndifficulties presented themselves, as the treacherous ice gave an\r\nimperfect footing, and a false step might precipitate them into the\r\nfrozen chasms that yawned around. To increase their distress respiration\r\nin these aërial regions became so difficult that every effort was\r\nattended with sharp pains in the head and limbs. At length they reached\r\nthe edge of the crater, which presented an irregular ellipse at its\r\nmouth more than a league in circumference. A lurid flame burned gloomily\r\nat the bottom, sending up a sulphurous steam, which, cooling as it rose,\r\nwas precipitated on the walls of the cavity. The party cast lots, and it\r\nfell on Montaño himself to descend in a basket into this hideous abyss,\r\ninto which he was lowered by his companions to the depth of four hundred\r\nfeet! This was repeated several times, till the adventurous cavalier had\r\ncollected a sufficient quantity of sulphur for the wants of the army.\r\n\r\nMany mineral springs owe their medicinal properties to the\r\nhydrosulphuric acid which they contain, and whose decomposition\r\nfrequently gives rise to the formation of sulphur. When the large marble\r\nslab which covers the imperial source at Aix-la-Chapelle is removed at\r\nthe end of every twenty years, about two hundred pounds of sulphur are\r\ncollected from the walls above the spring.\r\n\r\nCombinations of sulphur with metals, particularly with iron and copper\r\n(pyrites), occur in much more considerable masses and in a far greater\r\nnumber of localities than the pure uncombined mineral. Formerly the\r\nsulphides of iron (52½ per cent. sulphur, 47½ per cent. iron) and copper\r\nserved only for the fabrication of vitriol and alum; but since the\r\nprogress of chemical science has allowed them to be profitably used for\r\nthe manufacture of sulphuric acid, they have acquired a far greater\r\nimportance. Our own mines, which are situated chiefly in the county of\r\nWicklow, produced in 1866 at least 135,000 tons of iron pyrites, besides\r\nwhich an additional quantity of about 100,000 tons was imported from\r\nother countries.\r\n\r\nIn Southern Spain the mines of cupriferous pyrites—particularly in the\r\nprovince of Huelva, and in the Sierra de Tharsis, which on account of\r\nthe copper they contain were already worked in times anterior to the\r\nRoman occupation, and give proof of their ancient importance by the vast\r\ndimensions of their excavations—produced in 1863 no less than 246,137\r\ntons. In Portugal the mines of San Domingos, in the province of\r\nAlentejo, likewise afford a remarkable example of the mining industry of\r\nthe Romans, in the ancient adit which served for draining the works.\r\nThey merely used the ores that were richest in copper, and rejected the\r\npoorer qualities, which form the immense mounds of scoriæ round the\r\nmouth of the excavations. After having been abandoned for many centuries\r\nthe mines of San Domingos are once more diligently worked. Their newly\r\nacquired importance is due chiefly to the enterprise of Mr. James Mason,\r\nnow Baron of Pommorão. A railroad nine miles long unites the mine with\r\nthe left bank of the Guadiana, which has been rendered navigable for\r\nlarger vessels for a length of ten miles. Moreover the port of Pommorão\r\nhas been excavated in the steep bank of the river for the convenient\r\nshipping of the pyrites. Before 1858 a solitary hermitage was the only\r\ndwelling at San Domingos, which is now a thriving village of five\r\nhundred houses, with a handsome church and a railroad station. The\r\nnumber of the workmen employed in 1866 amounted to two thousand, and\r\nlarge works were being erected for the separation of the copper. In 1859\r\nthe produce of these mines amounted to 7,887 tons, and in 1866 it had\r\nalready risen to 167,028 tons, which formed the cargo of 544 ships. Such\r\nare the wonderful changes which can be brought about when the right man\r\nfinds the right place for the employment of his energies. France\r\nproduced in 1866 about 100,000 tons of pyrites, Prussia 38,248 tons, and\r\nBelgium 28,956 tons, so that the total production of Europe now probably\r\namounts to more than a million tons. In Canada the ore of a vast deposit\r\nof pyrites is exported to the United States, where it serves for the\r\nfabrication of sulphuric acid. Thus a substance scarcely noticed twenty\r\nyears ago has become an important article of commerce in both\r\nhemispheres.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXXVI.\r\n                                 AMBER.\r\n\r\nVarious Modes of its Collection on the Prussian Coast—What is Amber?—The\r\n  extinct Amber Tree—Insects of the Miocene Period inclosed in Amber—\r\n  Formidable Spiders—Ancient and Modern Trade in Amber.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmber is a resinous substance, the produce of extinct forests that now\r\nlie buried in the earth or under the bottom of the sea.\r\n\r\nIt is found abundantly on the Prussian coast of the Baltic, where it is\r\ncollected in many ways. After stormy weather it is frequently cast\r\nashore by the surf, or remains floating on the water. The amber-fishers,\r\nclothed in leather dresses, then wade into the sea, and secure the amber\r\nwith bag-nets, hung at the ends of long poles. They conclude that much\r\namber has been detached from its bed when they discover many pieces of\r\nlignite floating about. In some parts the faces of the precipitous\r\ncliffs along the shore are explored in boats, and masses of loose earth\r\nor rock, supposed to contain the object of search, are detached with\r\nlong poles having iron hooks at their ends. It is also dredged for on an\r\nextensive scale at the bottom of the Frische and Curische Haffs, and\r\nfurther inland large quantities are dug up out of the earth. That which\r\nis washed ashore generally consists of small pieces, more or less\r\ndamaged, while the specimens obtained by digging or dredging are\r\nfrequently of large size and of a tuberous form, so that, though\r\ninferior in quantity to the former, their value is probably ten times\r\ngreater.\r\n\r\nDigging for amber is a favourite pursuit of the peasantry; and though in\r\nmany cases it proves unsuccessful, yet sometimes it is highly\r\nremunerative. Near the village Kowall, a few miles from Dantzig, avenues\r\nof trees were planted a few years back along the high road. On digging\r\none of the holes destined for their reception, a rich amber nest was\r\nfound. Favourable signs induced the landowner to persevere in digging,\r\nand at length, at a depth of about thirty feet, such rich deposits of\r\namber were found as enabled him to pay off all the mortgages on his\r\nestate.\r\n\r\nThe territories where amber is found extend over Pomerania and East and\r\nWest Prussia, as far as Lithuania and Poland, but chiefly in the former\r\nprovinces, where it is found almost uniformly in separate nodules in the\r\nsand, clay, or fragments of lignite of the upper tertiary and alluvial\r\nformations. It also occurs in the beds of streams, and in the sand-banks\r\nof rivers. How far its seat may extend under the Baltic is of course\r\nunknown. Amber is likewise met with on the coast of Denmark and Sweden,\r\nin Gallicia and Moravia, near Christiania in Norway, and in Switzerland,\r\nnear Basle. It is occasionally found in the gravel-pits near London, and\r\nspecimens have been dug up in Hyde Park. At Aldborough, after a raking\r\ntide, it is thrown on the beach in considerable quantities, along with\r\nmasses of jet.\r\n\r\nOn the Sicilian coast, near the mouth of the River Giaretta, many pieces\r\nof a peculiar blue tinge are collected and sent to Catania to be cut and\r\npolished.\r\n\r\nSingle pieces and even large deposits of amber are said to have been\r\ndiscovered on the coasts of the Caspian Sea, in Siberia, Kamtschatka,\r\nand China, in North America and Madagascar. These accounts, however,\r\nrequire confirmation, as several other fossil or non-fossil resinous\r\nsubstances so strongly resemble amber as to have deceived even well-\r\ninformed naturalists.\r\n\r\nWhat is this substance, and how has it been produced? There is now no\r\nlonger any doubt that, like other vegetable resins, it has been secreted\r\nby trees which have long since disappeared from the surface of the\r\nearth, but once formed extensive forests on the islands or shores of the\r\nvast sea which at that time covered the plains of Northern Europe as far\r\nas the foot of the Ouralian chain.\r\n\r\nHow those islands disappeared, and how those primeval forests came to be\r\nburied under land and sea, becomes apparent from the changes that have\r\ntaken place in the South Baltic lands since the last two thousand years\r\nin consequence of partial upheavings and subsidences. According to the\r\noldest Prussian chronicler, Peter of Duesburg, whose narrative begins\r\nwith the year 1226, the waves of the Baltic at that time reached as far\r\nas the present town of Kulm, and a century later vessels sailed as far\r\nas Thorn. The present delta of the Vistula was a shallow morass, dotted\r\nhere and there with a flat island, and continued in that state until\r\ntowards the end of the thirteenth century, when dykes, raised by the\r\nindustry of man, prevented the constantly recurring inundations of the\r\nriver, and converted gloomy swamps into fertile meadows.\r\n\r\nIn other parts we find the sea incroaching upon the land. Since the\r\ntimes of the Teutonic Order a whole province between Pillau and Balga\r\nhas been submerged by the floods of the Frische Haff; and the first\r\nChristian church in Prussia, originally built five miles from the sea,\r\nnow stands close to the shore. Dense fir-forests rose in gloomy\r\nmonotony, but a thousand years back, where now the Baltic rolls its\r\nwaters; and where at that time ships lay at anchor we now find hillocks\r\nof sand. After such changes in comparatively so short a time, we cannot\r\nwonder that the islands of the amber period should have been replaced by\r\nother lands and another sea.\r\n\r\nWe are indebted for the first accurate observations on the nature of the\r\namber-tree to Professor Goeppert, who proved, by the microscopical\r\nexamination of the cells of fossil pieces of wood that were veined or\r\nstreaked with amber, and thus evidently had secreted the resin, that\r\nthey proceeded from several coniferæ, belonging to the extinct genus\r\nPinites.\r\n\r\nIn many of our pines and firs we frequently find between the annual\r\nrings crevices or interstices filled with resinous matter, but far less\r\nabundantly than in the amber-trees. The only existing coniferous plant\r\nthat can in any way be compared to them is the _Dammara australis_, of\r\nNew Zealand, at the base of whose trunk masses of resin, weighing twenty\r\nor thirty pounds, are frequently found. In Brazil Von Martius often saw\r\nsimilar lumps at the foot of the copal-tree, which dropping from the\r\ntrunk had collected in considerable masses between the roots, thus\r\nshowing that the large rounded or globular pieces of amber must have\r\nbeen formed in the same manner, while the thin and flat straight or\r\ncupuliform pieces were moulded upon the rind, or between the annual\r\nrings of the tree.\r\n\r\nWhen we consider the abundant secretion of the amber-trees, and the\r\nnumberless ages during which they may have flourished, we cannot wonder\r\nthat, since the oldest historic times, every violent storm which stirs\r\nup the ancient forest-grounds at the bottom of the Baltic casts the\r\nvaluable fossil ashore, and that in all probability future generations\r\nwill still be able to collect it in undiminished quantities.\r\n\r\nInteresting in itself, amber acquires a still greater scientific\r\nimportance through the remains of extinct plants and animals which are\r\nfound imbedded in its substance, as in a transparent shrine. As, in the\r\npresent day, many a luckless fly is caught in the recently secreted\r\nresins of the coniferæ and hymeneæ, thus also amber, while still in a\r\nsemi-fluid state, became the tomb of numerous insects and spiders. So\r\nwonderful is their preservation that they seem to have lived but\r\nyesterday, and yet how many millenniums may since have passed away; for\r\nalthough the amber formation belongs to the miocene period, and is\r\nconsequently of modern date when compared with the forests of the coal-\r\nformation, we still are separated from it by a vast series of ages.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INSECTS OR VEGETABLE SUBSTANCES ENCLOSED IN AMBER.]\r\n\r\nThe extinct organic world which is thus beautifully revealed to us so\r\ngreatly resembled the present vegetable and animal creation that, on a\r\nsuperficial examination of the fossil remains contained in a rich amber\r\ncollection, one would hardly suppose them to be anything very uncommon.\r\nThe unlearned observer who connects the idea of a past world with\r\ngrotesque or gigantic forms, shakes his head with an incredulous smile,\r\nand thinks that he has often seen similar flowers blooming in the\r\nfields, or met with similar insects in the forest. Even the naturalist\r\nis uncertain, until a closer inspection teaches him that each of these\r\nso wonderfully preserved plants or animals possesses some distinct\r\ncharacteristics which widely distinguish it from the analogous forms of\r\nthe present day.\r\n\r\nOf the plants of the coal period we find not a single one existing in\r\nthe Amber Forest; the vegetation is much more complicated and various in\r\nits aspect; and the numerous coniferæ indicate a climate similar to that\r\nof the present northern regions. But arboreal growth was by no means\r\nconfined to the coniferæ, for evergreen oaks and poplars flourished\r\nalong with them.\r\n\r\nHeath plants, chiefly belonging to genera similar to _Andromeda_,\r\n_Kalmia_, _Rhododendrum_, _Ledum_, and _Vaccinium_, as testified by\r\nnumerous leaves, formed the underwood of these forests, a vegetation\r\nsimilar in character to that of the Alleghany Mountains.\r\n\r\nThe deep shade of these primitive woods prevented the evaporation of\r\nwater, the ground remained damp and swampy, and the mouldering leaves\r\nproduced a thick layer of humus, on which flourished, no doubt, a dense\r\ncryptogamous vegetation, as well-preserved ferns, mosses, lichens,\r\nconfervæ, and small mushrooms, partly growing as parasites on dead\r\ninsects, sufficiently testify.\r\n\r\nBut the vegetable remains of that ancient period are far surpassed in\r\nvariety and number by the embalmed relics of the animal creation. Among\r\n2,000 specimens of insects collected by Dr. Berendt, to whom we owe the\r\nbest monograph on amber, this naturalist found more than 800 different\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\nFlies, phryganeæ, and other neuroptera, crustacea, millepedes and\r\nspiders, blattidæ in every phase of development, beetles, bees, and a\r\nlarge variety of ants, show a great similarity to the insect life of the\r\npresent day, and justify the conclusion that the contemporaneous animal\r\nforms, whose size or peculiar habitat prevented their being embalmed in\r\namber, were comparatively no less abundant.\r\n\r\nWhether man already existed at the time of the amber-formation is a\r\nquestion which, of course, could only be thoroughly settled by the\r\ndiscovery of some specimen of human workmanship _imbedded_ in the\r\nfossilised resin. At all events, the amber-rings of rude workmanship\r\nwhich have been found at a considerable depth below the surface of the\r\nearth, along with rough pieces, sufficiently prove that man must have\r\nbeen a very old inhabitant of the Baltic regions, for those remarkable\r\nspecimens of his unskilled industry have evidently preceded the\r\ncatastrophe which buried the rough amber under the earth, and must have\r\nbeen exposed for the same lapse of time to the influences of the soil,\r\nas they are all found covered with the same dull and damaged crust.\r\n\r\nThat birds enlivened the amber-forest might well have been supposed, as\r\nthere was no want of fruits and mealy seeds for their subsistence; but\r\ntheir existence is proved beyond all doubt by a feather which Dr.\r\nBerendt discovered in a piece of pale yellow transparent amber. To what\r\nbird may this remarkable relic of the past have belonged, and when may\r\nthe wing to which it was attached while living have cleaved the air?\r\n\r\nNo fish or reptile has ever yet been found in amber, however frequently\r\nfraud may have attempted to imbed them in a resinous case for the\r\ndeception of ignorance. It is, indeed, hardly conceivable that the finny\r\nand agile inhabitants of the waters could ever have allowed themselves\r\nto be caught in the resins of a terrestrial forest, though some small\r\nand less active reptiles may occasionally have been entrapped.\r\n\r\nOf all the insects and spiders, and the more rare crustaceans inclosed\r\nin amber, not a single specimen belongs to a species of the present\r\ntime; but though the species have disappeared, almost all the animals of\r\nthose primitive woods, as far as they are known, belong to genera of the\r\npresent time, so that upon the whole the proportion of the still\r\nflourishing genera to such as are extinct is as eight to one.\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable that, along with many specimens similar to the present\r\nindigenous types, some are found with a tropical character, whose\r\nrepresentatives are at present existing in the Brazilian forests, while\r\nothers are completely without any analogous forms in the present\r\ncreation; as, for instance, those strange Arachnidans, the Archæi,\r\nwhich, armed with toothed mandibles longer than the head, and provided\r\nwith strong raptorial claws, must have been most formidable enemies to\r\nthe contemporaneous insects.\r\n\r\nAmber was held in high estimation by the nations of antiquity, and\r\nreckoned among the gems on account of its rarity and value. Ornaments\r\nmade of this substance have been found among the vestiges of the\r\nlacustrine dwellings of Switzerland, and afford a convincing proof that\r\neven in prehistoric times it was an article of commerce. Many centuries\r\nbefore the Christian era the Phœnician navigators purchased amber from\r\nthe German tribes on the coast of the North Sea, these, in their turn,\r\nhaving obtained it, probably by barter, from the Baltic lands. Thus from\r\nhand to hand the beautiful fossil resin found its way to the courts of\r\nthe Indian princes on the Ganges, and of the Persian kings in Susa and\r\nPersepolis. According to Barth[69] the search for the Amber Land was\r\nmost probably the aim of the journey which the celebrated traveller\r\nPytheas of Massilia undertook 330 years before Christ, in the times of\r\nAlexander the Great.\r\n\r\nFootnote 69:\r\n\r\n  ‘Urgeschichte Deutschlands.’\r\n\r\nPlato and Aristotle, Herodotus and Æschylus, have described and lauded\r\nin prose and verse the wonderful properties of amber, which was not only\r\nhighly valued for its beauty, its aromatic smell, and its electro-\r\nmagnetic power, but also for the medicinal virtues ascribed to it by a\r\ncredulous age.\r\n\r\nUnder Nero the wealthy Roman senators and knights lavished immense sums\r\non decorating the seats and tables, the doors and columns, of their\r\nstate-rooms with amber, ivory, and tortoiseshell; and even at a later\r\nperiod, under Theodosius the Great, when the declining empire was\r\nalready verging to its fall, large quantities still continued to be\r\nimported from Germany.\r\n\r\nThough no longer so highly prized as by the ancients, amber still\r\ncontinues to be a source of considerable profit to the Baltic provinces.\r\nAlmost all the amber collected throughout the land finds its way to the\r\nseaports of Königsberg and Dantzig, where it is sorted according to its\r\nsize and quality. Good round pieces of a shape fit to be worked into\r\nornaments, and weighing about half an ounce, are worth from nine to ten\r\ndollars per pound; a good piece of a pound weight fetches as much as\r\nfifty dollars; and first-rate specimens of a still more considerable\r\nsize, and faultless in form and colour, are worth at least one hundred\r\ndollars, or even more, per pound. A mass weighing thirteen pounds has\r\nbeen found, the value of which at Constantinople was said to be no less\r\nthan 30,000 dollars. Smaller pieces from the size of a bean to that of a\r\npea, such as are fit for the beads of necklaces or rosaries, are valued\r\nat from two to four shillings per pound, and the grit or amber rubbish\r\nwhich is used for varnishing, fumigating, or the manufacture of oil and\r\nacid of amber, is worth no more than from three to eighteen pence. It is\r\nmuch to be regretted that amber, when melted or dissolved, is incapable\r\nof coalescing into larger masses with the retention of all its former\r\nqualities, as then its value would be considerably greater. Large amber\r\nvases would then ornament the apartments of the wealthy, and the corpses\r\nof the illustrious dead might repose in transparent shrines, and their\r\nfeatures be preserved from decay for many ages.\r\n\r\nThe trade in rough amber is almost exclusively in the hands of the Jews,\r\nwho purchase it from the amber-fishers, or are interested in the\r\ndiggings which are made on most of the littoral estates. Through the\r\nagency of the smaller collectors, it is then concentrated in the hands\r\nof the rich traders, who sell or export it in larger assortments.\r\n\r\nThe best qualities only of translucent, milky, or semi-opaque amber find\r\na ready sale in the Oriental market, where they are almost exclusively\r\nused for making the mouth-pieces to pipes, and these form an essential\r\nconstituent of the Turkish tschibouque; for there is a current belief\r\namong the Eastern nations that amber is incapable of transmitting\r\ninfection.\r\n\r\nEvery Turkish pasha sets his pride on a rich collection of pipes, as it\r\nis the hospitable custom of the Orient to offer a cup of coffee and a\r\nhookah or tschibouque to a stranger; and this fashion is of no small\r\nimportance to the amber-dealers of the Baltic. A somewhat inferior\r\nquality is sent by way of Copenhagen and London to China, Japan, and to\r\nthe East and West Indies.\r\n\r\nRussia also consumes a considerable quantity of amber, which is very\r\nelegantly turned or manufactured in St. Petersburg and Polangen, and\r\nthence finds its way over the whole empire. Here, as among the Turks,\r\nonly the translucent and perfectly opaque white qualities are esteemed;\r\nthe latter being chiefly employed for the manufacture of the calculating\r\ntables which are commonly used by the Russian merchants. Necklaces of\r\ntransparent amber are in great request among the peasantry of Hanover\r\nand Brunswick, where strings of pale-coloured crystalline beads weighing\r\nfrom half a pound to a pound are worth from fifty to sixty dollars.\r\n\r\nAmber of a deeper colour and of a rounded form is chiefly exported to\r\nSpain, France, and Italy.\r\n\r\nThus each country chooses according to its taste among the abundant\r\namber-masses which extinct forests furnish to the inhabitants of the\r\nBaltic coast-lands, and which trade, through a hundred known and unknown\r\nchannels, scatters over the whole surface of the globe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER XXXVII.\r\n     MISCELLANEOUS MINERAL SUBSTANCES USED IN THE INDUSTRIAL ARTS.\r\n\r\nAlum—Alum Mines of Tolfa—Borax—The Suffioni in the Florentine Lagoons—\r\n  China Clay: how formed?—Its Manufacture in Cornwall—Plumbago—Emery—\r\n  Tripolite.\r\n\r\nAlum, a double salt, consisting of sulphate of alumina (the peculiar\r\nearth of clay) and sulphate of potash, or sulphate of alumina and\r\nsulphate of ammonia, was known to the ancients, who used it in medicine,\r\nas it is now used, and also as a mordant in dyeing, as at the present\r\nday. Their alum was chiefly a natural production, which was best and\r\nmost abundantly obtained in Egypt. In later times Phocis, Lesbos, and\r\nother places supplied the Turks with alum for their magnificent Turkey\r\nred; and the Genoese merchants imported large quantities from the Levant\r\ninto Western Europe for the dyers of red cloth. In 1459 Bartholomew\r\nPerdix, a Genoese merchant who had been in Syria, observed a stone\r\nsuitable for alum in the Island of Ischia, and burning it with a good\r\nresult, was the first who introduced the manufacture into Europe. About\r\nthe same time John di Castro learnt the method at Constantinople, and\r\nmanufactured alum at Tolfa. This discovery of the mineral near Civita\r\nVecchia was considered so important by John di Castro that he announced\r\nit to the Pope as a great victory over the Turks, who annually took from\r\nthe Christians 300,000 pieces of gold for their dyed wool. The\r\nmanufacture of alum was then made a monopoly of the Papacy; and instead\r\nof buying it as before from the East, it was considered a Christian duty\r\nto obtain it only from the States of the Church. With the progress of\r\nProtestantism, however, the manufacture began to spread to other\r\ncountries. Hesse-Cassel began to make alum in 1554, and in 1600 alum\r\nslate was found near Whitby in Yorkshire.\r\n\r\nAlum-stone is a rare mineral, which contains all the elements of the\r\nsalt, but mixed with other matters from which it must be freed. For this\r\npurpose it is first calcined, then exposed to the weather, in heaps from\r\ntwo to three feet high, which are continually kept moist by sprinkling\r\nthem with water. As the water combines with the alum, the stones crumble\r\ndown and fall eventually into a pasty mass, which must be lixiviated\r\nwith warm water, and allowed to settle in a large cistern. The clear\r\nliquor on the surface, being drawn off, is to be evaporated and then\r\ncrystallised. A second crystallisation finishes the process, and\r\nfurnishes a marketable article. Thus the Roman alum is made; but its\r\nproduction being far from enough for the supply of the world, the\r\ngreater portion of the alum found in British commerce is made from alum-\r\nslate and analogous minerals, which contain only the elements of two of\r\nthe constituents, namely, clay and sulphur, and to which, therefore, the\r\nalkaline ingredient must be added.\r\n\r\nBorax, or Borate of Soda, is a substance extensively used in the glazes\r\nof porcelain, and recently in the making of the most brilliant crystal\r\nwhen combined with oxide of zinc. Formerly its chief supply was obtained\r\nunder the name of Tincal, from Thibet, where the crude product was dug\r\nin masses from the edges and shallow parts of a salt lake; and, in the\r\ncourse of a short time, the holes thus made were again filled. Crude\r\nborax is also found in China, Persia, the Island of Ceylon, and in South\r\nAmerica; but at present by far the largest quantity used in commerce is\r\nderived from the lagoons of Tuscany, where vapours charged with a minute\r\nquantity of boracic acid rise from volcanic vents.\r\n\r\nBefore the discovery of this acid, in the time of the Grand Duke Leopold\r\nI., by the chemist Hoefer, the fetid odour developed by the accompanying\r\nsulphuretted hydrogen gas, and the disruptions of the ground occasioned\r\nby the appearance of new suffioni or vents of vapour, had made the\r\nsuperstitious natives regard them as a diabolical scourge, which they\r\nvainly sought to remove by priestly exorcisms; but since 1818 the skill,\r\nor rather the industrial genius, of Count Larderel, originally a simple\r\nwandering merchant, has rendered these once abhorred fugitive vapours a\r\nsource of prosperity to the country, and were they to cease, all the\r\nsaints of the calendar would be invoked for their return.\r\n\r\nBy a most ingenious contrivance the waters which have been impregnated\r\nby the volcanic steams are concentrated in leaden reservoirs by the heat\r\nof the vapours themselves. The liquid, after having filled the first\r\ncompartment, is diffused very gradually into the second, then into the\r\nthird, and successively to the last, where it reaches such a state of\r\nconcentration that it deposits the crystallised acid, which the workmen\r\nimmediately remove by means of wooden scrapers. As this mode of gradual\r\nconcentration requires very few hands and no artificial heat, a\r\ncircumstance of great importance in a country without fuel, it may\r\nalmost be said that the acid is obtained without expense. The produce of\r\nthe lagoons amounts to more than 2,000 tons annually.\r\n\r\nChina-clay, or kaolin, a substance largely used for the fabrication of\r\nporcelain and in paper-making, is quarried from amidst the granitic\r\nmasses of Dartmoor and Cornwall. It results from the decomposition of\r\nfelspar, the chief constituent of granite, and is thus, to a certain\r\npoint, provided by Nature. As it is, however, mixed with many grosser\r\nparticles, it requires repeated washings in a series of small pits or\r\ntanks, until finally the water, still holding in suspension the finer\r\nand purer china-clay, is admitted into larger ponds. Here the clay is\r\ngradually deposited, and the clear water on the surface is from time to\r\ntime discharged by plug-holes on one side of the pond. This process is\r\ncontinued until by repeated accumulations the ponds are filled. The clay\r\nis then removed to large pans about a foot and a half in depth, where it\r\nremains exposed to the air until it is nearly dry--a tedious operation\r\nin our damp climate, as during the winter at least eight months are\r\nnecessary, whilst during the summer less than half the time suffices.\r\n\r\nWhen the clay is in a fit state it is cut into oblong masses and carried\r\nto the drying-house, a shed the sides of which are open wooden frames\r\nconstructed in the usual way for keeping off the rain, but admitting the\r\nfree passage of the air. The clay thus prepared is next scraped\r\nperfectly clean, and is then packed up into casks and carried to one of\r\nthe adjacent ports, to be shipped for the potteries or the paper\r\nmanufactories. It is of a beautiful and uniform whiteness, and is\r\nperfectly smooth and soft to the touch.\r\n\r\nChina-clay is an important article of commerce. The average annual\r\nproduction of Cornwall and Devonshire amounts to 105,000 tons, and it is\r\nreckoned that more than 200,000_l._ is annually spent in Cornwall in\r\nobtaining and preparing it.\r\n\r\nAs in our times no branch of industry remains unimproved, a machine has\r\nrecently been invented which greatly accelerates the drying. The lumps\r\nof china-clay are placed in the compartments of the drying machine, and\r\nthe whole is then rotated with great velocity. Thus the water is thrown\r\noff by the operation of the centrifugal force, and two tons of clay can\r\nbe dried in five minutes.\r\n\r\nThe remarkable contrast between the extreme hardness and softness of the\r\nsame primitive rock is a curiosity of geology well worth notice. ‘A\r\nstone,’ says the author of ‘Cornwall and its Mines,’ ‘is primevally\r\nfused and cooled into as hard a substance as nature affords; so hard\r\nthat it paves our streets in long enduring slabs and blocks. Tens of\r\nthousands of feet passing daily over it make no impression upon it.\r\nYears of travel only see it smooth and shining. The men who pass over it\r\npass away, but it is still durable and unsoftened. Halls and mansions,\r\nclubs and palaces, are built of it, and it endures unmarked by Time’s\r\ndevouring tooth. Is it not adamantine? But lo! what is that elegant cup\r\nfrom which you are sipping your tea? It is of Worcestershire china, fine\r\nand almost pellucid. Well, it is made out of the soft ruins of that very\r\ngranite whose endurance is proverbial. How remarkable that the best\r\ntypes of firmness and fragility should be found in the same stone! What\r\nthe immense billows of the Atlantic are now beating upon, at the Land’s\r\nEnd, without effect, that very substance has been found in such a\r\nfriable natural condition as to be finally moulded into that vase which\r\nstands, elegant and admired, upon your mantelpiece, and which one puff\r\nof wind, or one whirl of a lady’s silk dress, would dash down into\r\ninnumerable and unmendable fragments.’\r\n\r\nValuable kaolins are likewise found in China and Japan, in Saxony and\r\nFrance; but the production is nowhere so extensive as in Cornwall.\r\n\r\nThe best quality of Plumbago, graphite, or black-lead, from which the\r\nfinest lead-pencils were made, was formerly abundantly supplied by the\r\nmine of Borrowdale in Cumberland. At one time as much as 100,000_l._ was\r\nrealised in a year, the plumbago selling at forty-five shillings per\r\npound. Its high value, however, proved a source of loss to the\r\nproprietors, for robbery found here a most profitable field. Even the\r\nguard stationed over it by the owners was of little avail against\r\ndetermined thieves, for about a century ago a body of miners broke into\r\nthe mines by main force, and held possession of it for a considerable\r\ntime. The treasure was then protected by a building consisting of four\r\nrooms upon the ground floor, and immediately under one of them is the\r\nopening, secured by a trapdoor, through which alone workmen could enter\r\nthe interior of the mountain. The mine has now, however, not been worked\r\nfor many years. Its ‘nests’ of plumbago seem to be exhausted, and it is\r\nno longer an object capable of exciting greed, or worthy of anxious\r\nprotection. At present the mines of Batougal, near Irkutsk in East\r\nSiberia, furnish large quantities of graphite of the very best quality;\r\nand the plumbago from Ceylon is likewise highly esteemed. Inferior\r\nqualities--employed for counteracting friction between rubbing surfaces\r\nof wood or metal, for making crucibles and portable furnaces, for giving\r\na gloss to the surface of cast iron, &c. &c.--are supplied by Lower\r\nAustria, Bohemia, Bavaria, Ticonderago in the State of New York, New\r\nJersey, Arendal in Norway, Finland, &c. &c.\r\n\r\nThe name black-lead applied to plumbago, from its resembling lead in its\r\nexternal appearance, is very inappropriate, as not a particle of that\r\nmetal enters into its composition. Plumbago might indeed more justly be\r\ncalled black-diamond, for, consisting, in its pure state, of carbon, it\r\nis consequently but another form of the chief of precious stones.\r\n\r\nThe beautiful oriental ruby has likewise a humble cousin among the\r\nuseful minerals, as it is identical in composition with Emery, which,\r\nsince the remotest antiquity, has been employed for the grinding of\r\nmetals and glass. Emery was formerly almost exclusively furnished by the\r\nisland of Naxos; but since 1847 new mines have been discovered in some\r\nother isles of the Grecian Archipelago, and in the neighbourhood of\r\nSmyrna, from which place it is now imported in large quantities. In 1850\r\nthe total production of the East amounted to 1,500 tons. In 1864 a\r\nconsiderable mine of emery was discovered at Chester (Hampden County,\r\nMassachusetts), and as might be expected in a country where none of the\r\ngifts of nature are allowed to be wasted, already provides for the wants\r\nof all the manufactories of the United States.\r\n\r\nTripolite, a mineral related to the precious opal, as it consists almost\r\nentirely of silica, is likewise used for polishing stones, metals, and\r\nglasses. Its composition is truly remarkable, as it is actually formed\r\nof the exuviæ, or rather the flinty envelopes of diatoms, which belong\r\nto the minutest forms of vegetable life. They are recognised with such\r\ndistinctness in the microscope that the analogies between them and\r\nliving species may be readily traced, and in many cases there are no\r\nappreciable differences between the living and the petrified. As every\r\ncubic inch of tripolite contains millions of these exuviæ, and the stone\r\nnot seldom occurs in deposits often many miles in area, imagination is\r\nat a loss to conceive the innumerable multitudes of organised atoms\r\nwhose flinty remains have been piled up in these masses of hard rock.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER XXXVIII.\r\n                          CELEBRATED QUARRIES.\r\n\r\nCarrara—The Pentelikon—The Parian Quarries—Rosso antico and Verde\r\n  antico—The Porphyry of Elfdal—The Gypsum of Montmartre—The Alabaster\r\n  of Volterra—The Slate Quarries of Wales—‘Princesses’ and ‘Duchesses’—\r\n  ‘Ladies’ and ‘Fat Ladies’—St. Peter’s Mount near Maestricht—Egyptian\r\n  Quarries—Haggar Silsilis—The Latomiæ of Syracuse—A Triumph of Poetry.\r\n\r\n\r\nBesides metals, and the various minerals mentioned in the previous\r\nchapter, the solid earth-rind furnishes an inexhaustible supply of\r\nmarbles, slates, and stones for building or paving; and their extraction\r\noccupies a vast number of industrious hands.\r\n\r\nIn a popular work on geology, published some years ago, Mr. Burat\r\ninforms us that about 70,000 persons were employed in the 18,000 more or\r\nless important quarries at that time worked in France, and that the\r\nproduce of their labour amounted to a value of more than 2,000,000_l._\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that the quarries of England or Germany are at\r\nleast equally productive, and thus a very moderate estimate leads us to\r\nthe conclusion that the quarries of Europe, from those which furnish the\r\ncostliest marble to those which yield the commonest building-stone,\r\nemploy at least half a million of workmen, and produce an annual value\r\nof no less than 12,000,000_l._, a sum which is probably doubled or\r\ntrebled before the heavy materials can be placed in the hands of the\r\nconsumer. A land ribbed with stone, like England, has therefore a\r\nconsiderable advantage over a flat alluvial plain, like Holland, as it\r\npossesses in its rocky foundations a source of wealth which nature has\r\ndenied to the latter.\r\n\r\nThough several other stones, such as granite and porphyry, are\r\nsusceptible of a fine polished surface, and serve for the decoration of\r\npalaces and churches, yet marble or pure compact limestone is chiefly\r\nused for ornamental purposes, both on account of its beautifully\r\nvariegated tints, and its inferior hardness, which allows it to be more\r\neasily worked. Our Derbyshire and Devonshire quarries supply a great\r\nvariety of richly coloured marbles; but the best material for the\r\nsculptor is supplied by the limestone mountains of Carrara, which\r\nfurnish a homogeneous marble of the purest white, with a fine granular\r\ntexture, resembling that of loaf sugar. These far-famed quarries, which\r\nwere worked by the ancients, having been opened in the time of Julius\r\nCæsar, are situated between Spezzia and Lucca, in the Alpe Apuana, a\r\nsmall mountain-group no less remarkable for its bold and sharp outlines\r\nthan for its almost total isolation from the monotonous chain of the\r\nApennines, from which it is separated by a wide semicircular plain.\r\nWhere the Alpe Apuana faces the sea, it is chiefly formed of magnesian\r\nand glimmer slate, in which large masses of limestone are imbedded; but\r\nthe more inland part of the group belongs entirely to the limestone\r\nformation, and abounds in romantic scenery and noble peaks towering to a\r\nheight of six thousand feet above the level of the sea. Towards its\r\nnorth-western extremity rises Monte Sacro (5,200 feet in height), the\r\nfamous marble mountain on whose slopes are scattered the quarries to\r\nwhich the small town of Carrara owes its ancient and world-wide\r\ncelebrity.\r\n\r\nThe quarries themselves by no means afford an imposing sight, as they\r\nare mostly small, and very badly worked; but it is interesting to watch\r\nthe transport of the huge blocks of superb material from the various\r\nglens in which the quarries are situated, while the numerous water-mills\r\nfor cutting or polishing the marble enliven the whole neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nIn the town of Carrara numerous sculptors are constantly employed in\r\nrough-hewing the marble into various forms, such as capitals, friezes,\r\nbusts, &c., &c., in order to diminish the cost of transport, or to\r\ndiscover faults in the stone before it is shipped. There are also shops\r\nwhere marble trinkets or ornaments are exposed for sale; but Florence,\r\nLeghorn, and Genoa are the chief dépôts of ready-made marble articles,\r\nsuch as vases, urns, sculptured chimney-pieces, and copies of renowned\r\nstatues. Different kinds of fruit are also executed in marble, and with\r\nthe aid of colour made to imitate nature so closely as to deceive the\r\neye.\r\n\r\nIn Carrara the inferior qualities of marble are used for building and\r\npaving, as it is here the cheapest material. The window and door frames,\r\nthe flooring and the chimney slabs, in even the meanest houses, are made\r\nof marble, and form a striking contrast to the squalid poverty of the\r\nremainder of the furniture.\r\n\r\nThe quarries which furnished the material for the finest works of the\r\nGrecian chisel partake of the interest which attaches to every vestige\r\nof ancient art.\r\n\r\nAbout eight miles to the north of Athens rises the Pentelikon, or Mount\r\nPenteles, from whose flanks was excavated the marble that served for the\r\nconstruction of the Parthenon, of the Temple of the Olympian Zeus, and\r\nof the other matchless edifices of the Athenian Acropolis. No other\r\nquarries in the world can boast of their material having undergone a\r\nmore beautiful transformation, for never has marble been more highly\r\nennobled than by the genius of Pheidias! The ancient roads ascending\r\nfrom the foot of the mountain to the quarries still show the traces of\r\nthe sledges on which were transported the huge blocks of more than\r\ntwenty tons in weight that now lie scattered among the ruins of the\r\nAcropolis.\r\n\r\nOn the summit of the Pentelikon the Athenians had placed a statue of\r\nPallas Athene, that the goddess might overlook the land devoted to her\r\nworship. Here, from a height of 3,500 feet, she looked down upon the\r\nplain of Marathon, and many other spots of everlasting renown; but the\r\noutlines of the prospect are monotonous and naked, and require for their\r\nembellishment the beautifying remembrances of the past.\r\n\r\nMount Marpena, in the island of Paros, furnished the most renowned\r\nstatuary marble of ancient times. It was called Lychnites because its\r\nquarries were worked by lamp-light, in deep, minelike excavations; and\r\nthe difficulty and cost of its extraction show how highly it was prized.\r\nIt has a yellowish white colour and a texture composed of fine shining\r\nscales lying in all directions. The celebrated Arundelian marbles at\r\nOxford consist of Parian marble, as does also the Medicean Venus. More\r\nthan twenty centuries have elapsed since the Parian quarries were\r\nabandoned in consequence of the decay of Grecian art; but in our\r\nenterprising days a company has been formed (1857) for working the\r\nbeautiful marble which has been recently discovered near St. Minas, not\r\nfar from the site of the ancient quarries, and is said to be superior\r\nnot only to that of Carrara but even to the renowned Lychnites of the\r\nancients.\r\n\r\nThe quarries which in olden times furnished the beautifully coloured\r\nmarbles called Rosso antico and Verde antico had likewise for many\r\ncenturies been abandoned and totally forgotten. In 1846 they were\r\nrediscovered on the island of Tino and in the Maina by Professor Siegel,\r\nwho soon after undertook to work them, and has furnished, among others,\r\na large number of the beautiful columns of Rosso antico which decorate\r\nthe interior of the court of the basilica of St. Paul’s in Rome. The\r\nhammer of the quarryman once more resounds in the wilds of the Taygetos,\r\nand the lawless robber of the Maina already feels the beneficial\r\ninfluence of industry.\r\n\r\nOn the slopes of the mountains which bound the impetuous Oesterdal Elbe\r\nin Sweden, in a wild and desolate country, where the poverty of the\r\npeople is so great that they frequently grind the bark of fir-trees to\r\nmix it with their bread, are situated the finest quarries of porphyry\r\nwhich Europe possesses. This beautiful stone, which attracts the eye\r\neven in its unpolished state, consists of a red-brown or blood-red mass,\r\nin which numerous small flesh-coloured felspar pieces are embedded.\r\nAfter having been rough-hewn on the spot, the blocks are transported to\r\nthe neighbouring works of Elfdal, where they are cut and polished into\r\nslabs, vases, chimney-pieces, and other articles fit for the decoration\r\nof palaces. The contrast is most striking when, after having traversed\r\nthe barren neighbourhood, and still deeply impressed with the sight of\r\npoverty and distress on his road, the traveller suddenly finds himself\r\nbefore a group of handsome buildings which at once bear witness to the\r\nactivity within.\r\n\r\nBesides the red porphyry of Elfdal, that of the Altai Mountains in Asia\r\ndeserves to be noticed. It consists of a brown-red mass with snow-white\r\ncrystals, and is capable of a very fine polish. The quarries are\r\nsituated on the face of a high rock on the left bank of the Kurgun, one\r\nof the wildest mountain streams of the Altai, about one hundred miles\r\nfrom the town of Kolywansk, where it is cut and polished.\r\n\r\nGypsum, or sulphate of lime, and the peculiar form of that mineral\r\ncalled Alabaster, are substances of considerable importance in the arts.\r\nRendered more valuable by a slight admixture of carbonate of lime, the\r\ngypsum of Montmartre, near Paris, has long been celebrated for its\r\nexcellence as a cement or stucco. It is found resting on a limestone of\r\nmarine origin, and in some places appears immediately beneath the\r\nvegetable soil, so that it can be readily and conveniently worked\r\nwithout having recourse to subterranean excavation. These quarries\r\nfurnish the whole of northern France with the well-known plaster of\r\nParis, and the value of their annual produce amounts to not less than\r\n100,000_l_.\r\n\r\nWhen sulphate of lime or gypsum assumes the opaque, consistent, and\r\nsemi-transparent form of alabaster, it is worked like marble. The pure\r\nwhite and harder varieties are usually employed for the sculpture of\r\nstatues and busts; while the softer kinds are cut into vases, boxes,\r\nlamps, and other ornamental objects. The alabaster quarries in the\r\nneighbourhood of the ancient Etruscan town of Volterra are the most\r\nfamous in Europe, and have afforded employment for many centuries to her\r\nindustrious population. Volterra exports her beautiful produce to all\r\nparts of the world, even as far as the interior of China. Beggary is\r\nhere unknown (a rare case in Italy), for even women and children are all\r\nemployed in cutting, sawing, rasping, or filing alabaster. In the\r\nremotest antiquity, when the city was still called Volathri or\r\nVolaterræ, this industry was practised within her walls, and a\r\ncollection of sepulchral urns and other works of Etruscan art contained\r\nin the town-hall bears testimony to her ancient skill. Now, however, art\r\nseems to have degenerated into mere manufacturing ability; the statues\r\nand other objects are almost always repetitions of the same models, and\r\nbut very rarely some speculative person introduces a novelty, for the\r\npurpose of obtaining a somewhat higher price for his wares.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FENRHYN SLATE QUARRY, NORTH WALES.]\r\n\r\nGreat Britain possesses apparently inexhaustible quantities of alabaster\r\nin the red marl formation in the neighbourhood of Derby, where it has\r\nbeen worked for many centuries. The great bulk of it is used for making\r\nplaster of Paris, and as a manure, or as the basis of many kinds of\r\ncements. For these common industrial purposes it is worked by mining\r\nunderground, and the stone is blasted by gunpowder; but this shakes it\r\nso much as to render it unfit for works of ornament, to procure blocks\r\nfor which it is necessary to have an open quarry. By removing the\r\nsuperincumbent marl, and laying bare a large surface of the rock, the\r\nalabaster, being very irregular in form, and jutting out in several\r\nparts, can be sawn out in blocks of a considerable size and\r\ncomparatively sound. This stone, when preserved from the action of\r\nwater, which soon decomposes it, is extremely durable, as may be seen in\r\nchurches all over this country, where monumental effigies many centuries\r\nold are still as perfect as when they proceeded from the sculptor’s\r\nchisel. The Derbyshire alabaster, commonly called Derbyshire spar, gives\r\nemployment to a good many hands in forming it into useful and ornamental\r\narticles. Another kind of alabaster also found in Derbyshire is\r\ncrystallised in long needlelike silky fibres, which, being susceptible\r\nof a high polish and quite lustrous, is used for making necklaces,\r\nbracelets, brooches, and other small articles.\r\n\r\nBesides her inexhaustible coal, iron, and lead mines, Wales possesses in\r\nher slate quarries a great source of mineral wealth. For this article,\r\nwhich many would suppose to be but of secondary importance, is here\r\nfound in such abundance and perfection as to command a ready market all\r\nover the world. Thus, in North Wales the face of the mountains is\r\neverywhere dotted or scarred with slate quarries, of which by far the\r\nmost important and largest are those of Llandegui, six miles from\r\nBangor, in which more than three thousand persons are employed. This\r\ncircumstance alone will give an idea of their extent, but still more\r\ntheir having their own harbour, Port Penrhyn, which holds vessels of\r\nfrom 300 to 400 tons, and whence slates are sent not only to all parts\r\nof Great Britain, but even to North America. The cost of the inclined\r\nplanes and railroads which serve to transport the slates from the\r\nquarries to the port is said to have amounted to 170,000_l._ The masses\r\nof slate are either detached from the rock by blasting, or by wedges and\r\ncrowbars. They are then shaped on the spot into the various forms for\r\nwhich they are destined to be used.\r\n\r\nThough the quarries of Llandegui are unrivalled, yet there are others\r\nwhich give employment to workmen whose numbers range from a thousand to\r\nfifteen hundred. In those that export their produce by way of Carnarvon,\r\nwhich owes its prosperity almost entirely to this branch of industry,\r\nabout 2,300 men were employed in the year 1842, and since then their\r\nnumber has very much increased. Walking on the handsome new quay of the\r\ntown, the visitor everywhere sees slates ready for shipment in the\r\nnumerous small vessels which crowd the picturesque harbour. They are\r\nheaped up and arranged or sorted in large regular piles according to\r\ntheir dimensions or quality, the ‘ladies’ and ‘fat ladies’ apart, as\r\nalso the ‘countesses,’ ‘marchionesses,’ ‘princesses,’ ‘duchesses,’ and\r\n‘queens,’ for by these aristocratic names the slate merchants\r\ndistinguish the various sizes of the humble article they deal in.\r\n\r\nKohl, the celebrated traveller, remarks that, whenever a new branch of\r\nindustry springs up in England, a number of active hands and inventive\r\nheads set to work to extend its application. This was also the case with\r\nthe Welsh slates, when, about half a century ago, they first began to\r\nattract the notice of the commercial world. A polish was soon invented\r\nin London which gave them the appearance of the finest black marble. As\r\nthey are easily worked with the aid of a turning lathe, they can thus be\r\nused for the manufacture of many useful and ornamental articles, which\r\nhave all the lustre of ebony, and may be obtained at a much cheaper\r\nrate.\r\n\r\nThe quarries of St. Peter’s Mount, near Maestricht in the Netherlands,\r\nare probably the most extensive in Europe. For the white tufaceous\r\nlimestone of the mountain has been used from time immemorial both for\r\nbuilding and manuring, and the enormous extent of its caverns is perhaps\r\neven owing in a greater measure to the agriculturist than to the\r\narchitect. And yet St. Peter’s Mount, situated near a town of moderate\r\nextent, would hardly have been excavated beyond the limits of a common\r\nquarry if the broad Meuse, flowing at its foot, had not opened towards\r\nHolland an almost unlimited market for its produce. Sure of being able\r\nto dispose of all the materials they can possibly extract from the\r\nearth, the quarrymen of the neighbourhood are thus yearly adding new\r\npassages to the labyrinths at which so many generations of their\r\nforefathers have toiled from age to age.\r\n\r\nIn spring and summer they are mostly occupied with agricultural\r\npursuits, and then but rarely leave the light of day to burrow in the\r\nentrails of the earth by the dismal ‘sheen’ of smoky lamps; but as soon\r\nas the approach of winter puts a stop to the labours of the field, they\r\ndescend into the cavities of the mountain, and begin to excavate the\r\nvast mounds of stone or grit which are to be shipped in the following\r\nspring.\r\n\r\nAccompanied by a guide, the stranger enters these amazing quarries, that\r\nextend for miles into the interior of the mountain, and is soon lost in\r\nwonder at their endless passages, perpetually crossing each other to the\r\nright and left, and ending in utter darkness. The dismal grandeur of\r\nthese dark regions is increased by their awful silence, for but rarely a\r\ndrop of water falls from the vaults into a small pool below, and even\r\nthe voice of man dies away without awakening an echo.\r\n\r\nBut in order to make one feel the full impression of night and silence,\r\nthe guide, after penetrating to some distance into the interior of the\r\ncave, extinguishes his torch. A strange sensation of awe then creeps\r\nover the boldest heart, and by an almost irresistible instinct the\r\nstranger seeks the nearest wall, as if to convince himself that he has\r\nat least the sense of touch to depend upon where the eye vainly seeks\r\nfor the least ray of light, and the ear as vainly listens for a sound.\r\nThen also he feels how dreadful must have been the agonies of the\r\ndespairing wretches who, having lost their way in these dark labyrinths,\r\nprayed and wept and shouted in vain, until their last groans died away\r\nunheard.\r\n\r\nIt has not seldom happened that persons have hopelessly strayed about in\r\nthese vast caverns, and there slowly perished, while but a few fathoms\r\nabove the labourer was driving his plough forward or the reaper singing\r\nhis evening song. In several parts of the caverns an inscription on the\r\nwalls points out where and under what circumstances a corpse has been\r\nfound, or a few traces of black chalk give a rude portrait of the\r\nvictim. Here we read the short story of a workman who, losing his way,\r\nroamed about till the last glimmer from his torch died out in his burnt\r\nfingers; there that of another whose lamp by some chance was overturned,\r\nand who, plunged in sudden darkness, was no longer able to find his way\r\nout of some remote passage.\r\n\r\nThe French geologist, Faujas de Saint-Fond, who, in the year 1798\r\nminutely explored the Mount, relates that one day the torches that were\r\ncarried before him discovered at some distance a dark object stretched\r\nout upon the floor, which on a closer inspection proved to be a corpse.\r\nIt was a shrivelled mummy, completely dressed, the hat lying close to\r\nthe head, the shoes separated from the feet, and a rosary in its hand.\r\nFrom the dress Faujas conjectured it to be the body of a workman, and\r\nperhaps more than half a century might have passed since the poor man\r\ndied in the quarry which had probably given him bread for many a year.\r\nThe dry air, and the total absence of insects in these subterranean\r\nvaults, explained the mummy-like preservation of the corpse.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1640 four Franciscan monks resolved, for the greater glory\r\nof God and of their tutelary saint, to construct a chapel in a deserted\r\npart of the caverns. Taking with them a thick pack of thread, they\r\nattached one end of it to a spot where the trodden path ceased, and\r\npenetrating deeper and deeper into the unknown vaults as long as their\r\nthread lasted, finally came to a larger cavity or hall, which had\r\nprobably not been visited for centuries, but which in consequence of\r\ntheir misfortune has since become one of the show-places of the quarry.\r\nAt the entrance one of them drew with a piece of coal a still existing\r\nsketch of his convent on the wall, and wrote underneath the date of the\r\ndiscovery which was to be so fatal to him and his companions. What must\r\nhave been their dismay when, wishing to retrace their steps, they\r\ndiscovered that, by some accident, the thread which alone could lead\r\nthem out of the labyrinth had been severed, and that they were left\r\nwithout guide or compass in the inextricable maze of the caverns. The\r\nprior, alarmed at their prolonged absence, and knowing that they had\r\nvisited the quarries, ordered them to be sought for. But such is the\r\nvast extent of the excavations that it was only after seven days that\r\ntheir corpses were found, lying closely together, their faces downwards\r\nand their hands folded, as if their last moments had been spent in\r\nprayer.\r\n\r\nThe caverns of St. Peter’s Mount, generally devoted only to the pacific\r\nlabours of the quarryman or to unbroken silence, have once been the\r\nscene of a bloody fight; and as the quiet waters of the Todtensee, on\r\nthe heights of the Grimsel, have witnessed a sanguinary battle between\r\nthe French and the Russians, so these subterranean vaults have once\r\nresounded with the din of fire-arms and the shouts of embittered\r\nenemies.\r\n\r\nDuring the siege above mentioned, which brought Maestricht into the\r\npower of the French Republic, some sharpshooters of the besieging army\r\ntook up their position in the quarries. The Austrians, who occupied Fort\r\nSt. Pierre, on the back of the mountain, and had already made several\r\nsuccessful sorties, formed the plan of penetrating into the caverns from\r\nthe interior of the fort, in the hope of surprising the enemy who\r\noccupied their entrances. But as the torches which lighted their silent\r\nmarch betrayed their intentions, the Frenchmen cautiously and slowly\r\nadvanced upon them, surprised them with a sudden volley of musketry, and\r\ndrove back into the depths of the caverns all those who were not made\r\nprisoners or killed.\r\n\r\nTo the geologist the quarries of St. Peter’s are particularly\r\ninteresting, as the calcareous tuff of which they are composed is\r\nextremely rich in valuable petrifactions. Here, among others, was found,\r\nin 1770, the famous skull of the Mososaurus Hoffmanni, a giant lizard\r\ntwenty feet long, which before the discovery of the still more colossal\r\nIchthyosauri in England and Bavaria was considered as the most\r\nremarkable fossil known, and now forms one of the chief ornaments of the\r\nMuseum of the Jardin des Plantes in Paris.\r\n\r\nThere are no subterranean animals peculiar to the caverns of St.\r\nPeter’s, such as have been found in large natural caves; but foxes and\r\nmartens not seldom find here a secure retreat, and many a bat hibernates\r\nin their warm recesses.\r\n\r\nNear the small village El Massara, which, like all the hamlets on the\r\nNile, stands in a grove of date-palms, are situated the quarries which\r\nfurnished materials for the temples and pyramids of Memphis. After\r\nhaving first traversed a wide plain of sand, the visitor reaches the\r\nfoot of the Mokattam mountain. Here the ground is everywhere covered\r\nwith enormous heaps of rubbish from the quarries, which look more like\r\nan attempt to cut the whole mountain into blocks and carry it away than\r\nsimple excavations for building materials. At first sight the traveller\r\nmight indeed almost fancy that all the eighteen thousand towns of\r\nancient Egypt must have been dug out of these stupendous excavations.\r\nHere he may see the mountain cut through from top to bottom, and open\r\nspaces as large as the squares of a great capital on a level with the\r\nplain, while there the rock has been hollowed out into enormous halls,\r\ntheir roofs reposing on titanic pilasters. In one spot the rocky wall\r\nhas been cut rectangularly, after which it runs parallel to the river\r\nfor a distance of about fifteen hundred feet, and then again projects at\r\na right angle towards the plain, so that in the space between the wings\r\nthere would be room enough for a small town, yet all the stone which\r\nonce filled this vast cavity has been sawn from the rock and carried\r\nover the Nile. Here and there enormous masses of stone, like those which\r\nin winter roll from the high Alps into the valleys, have fallen from the\r\noverhanging rock. Many bear evident traces that the hand of man\r\noriginally severed them from the mountain; but their size was such as to\r\nbaffle even the perseverance and mechanical skill of the Egyptians. No\r\npower could remove them from the spot, and thus they remained to be worn\r\naway by time, which as yet, however, has hardly left a trace of its\r\npassage upon their chiselled sides.\r\n\r\nFrom the mounds of rubbish that lie before the openings of the quarries\r\nthere is a magnificent view of the long line of pyramids which mark, to\r\nthe west, the extreme limits of the fertile land. Here, indeed, is a\r\nplace for meditation, for nowhere do stones preach a more impressive\r\nsermon!\r\n\r\nThe quarries of Haggar Silsilis, in a wild mountainous country between\r\nAssuan and Edfu, are on a still grander scale. Passages as broad as\r\nstreets, running on both sides between walls fifty or sixty feet high,\r\nnow stretching straight forward, now curving, extend from the eastern\r\nbank of the river into the heart of the mountain, where spaces have been\r\nhollowed out large enough to embrace the Roman Colosseum! To the north\r\nnumberless Cyclopean caverns have been hewn out, and enormous colonnades\r\nstretch along the foot of the mountain. The rough-hewn irregular roof\r\nrests upon immense square, or many-sided, pillars, frequently eighty or\r\na hundred feet in circumference. Enormous blocks, already completely\r\nseparated from the rock, rest on smaller ones, ready to be transported,\r\nwhile in other parts the labours of the quarrymen were suddenly arrested\r\nby the invasion of the foreign conqueror who put a stop to the dominion\r\nof the priests. The Bedouin, astonished at these vast works, so alien to\r\nhis roving habits, exclaims at their aspect, with a wondering mien,\r\n‘Wallah! if these unbelievers had lived until now, they would have\r\ncarried away the whole mountain and levelled it with the ground!’\r\n\r\nSyracuse, the proud city that vied with Rome itself, and the remembrance\r\nof whose magnificence and glory, both in arts and arms, will live as\r\nlong as classical literature, is now reduced to a heap of rubbish, for\r\nher remains deserve not the name of a city. But though even her ruins\r\nhave mostly disappeared, ‘_etiam periere ruinæ_,’ yet the vast quarries\r\nwhich furnished the materials for her palaces and temples still bear\r\nwitness to her ancient grandeur.\r\n\r\nThe Latomiæ of the Capuchins, thus named from a convent of that order,\r\nsituated on the rock above, now form a noble subterranean garden, one of\r\nthe most romantic and beautiful spots imaginable. Most of it is about\r\none hundred feet below the level of the earth, and of an incredible\r\nextent. The whole is hewn out of a rock as hard as marble, composed of a\r\nconcretion of shells, gravel, and other marine bodies. The bottom of\r\nthis immense quarry, from which pro bably the greatest part of Syracuse\r\nwas built, is now covered with an exceedingly rich soil; and as no wind\r\nfrom any point of the compass can touch it, it is filled with a great\r\nvariety of the finest shrubs and fruit-trees, which bear with prodigal\r\nluxuriance, and are never blasted. The oranges, citrons, pomegranates,\r\nand figs are all of a remarkable size, and, frequently growing out of\r\nthe hard rock, where there is no visible soil, exhibit a very uncommon\r\nand pleasing appearance. This quarry is the same that Cicero eloquently\r\ndescribes as the vast and magnificent work of the kings and tyrants of\r\nancient Syracuse, hewn out of the rock to a prodigious depth. It also\r\nserved as a prison for the Athenian soldiers that were made captives\r\nduring the Peloponnesian war, and even now these vast excavations might\r\nbe used for a similar purpose, as their high and overhanging walls\r\nforbid the possibility of escape, and ten men would be able to guard ten\r\nthousand without danger. Yet the genius of Euripides liberated many of\r\nhis countrymen from this deep pit of bondage, for happening to sing a\r\nchorus of one of his immortal tragedies, they moved the tyrant to\r\nrestore them to liberty, in honour of their illustrious fellow-citizen.\r\nNever has a more grateful offering been awarded to a poet’s genius, and\r\nnever has the magical power of the Muses celebrated a nobler triumph.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXXIX.\r\n                            PRECIOUS STONES.\r\n\r\nDiamonds--Diamond Cutting--Rose Diamonds--Brilliants--The Diamond\r\n  District in Brazil--Diamond Lavras--The great Russian Diamond--The\r\n  Regent--The Koh-i-Noor--Its History--The Star of the South--Diamonds\r\n  used for Industrial Purposes--The Oriental Ruby and Sapphire--The\r\n  Spinel--The Chrysoberyl--The Emerald--The Beryl--The Zircon--The\r\n  Topaz--The Oriental Turquoise--The Garnet--Lapis Lazuli--The Noble\r\n  Opal--Inferior Precious Stones--The Agate-Cutters of Oberstein--Rock\r\n  Crystal--The Rock-crystal Grotto of the Galenstock.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn former ages superstition ascribed a strange mysterious power to\r\nprecious stones. Gems of conspicuous size or lustre were supposed to\r\nconfer health and prosperity on their owners, to preserve them in the\r\nmidst of the most appalling dangers, or even to give them a command over\r\nthe world of spirits.\r\n\r\nThe crucible of modern chemistry has, indeed, effectually dispelled\r\nthese illusions of a poetic fancy; but the precious stones have lost\r\nnothing in value by their nature being better known. They are still the\r\nfavourite and most costly ornaments of wealth and beauty, and they still\r\ndeservedly rank among the wonders of creation. For surely no fabled\r\ntalismanic virtues can be more worthy of admiration than that natural\r\npower which in the secret laboratories of the subterranean world has\r\ncaused their atoms to unite in lustrous crystals, and imparted to such\r\nvulgar materials as carbon, clay, or sand the gorgeous reflections of\r\nthe rainbow or the glorious colours of the setting sun.\r\n\r\nThe diamond, it is almost unnecessary to say, is the chief of precious\r\nstones, none other equalling it in brilliancy and refractive energy.\r\nAlthough generally colourless, like pure rock-crystal, yet it is also\r\nfound of every variety of tint, from a roseate hue to crimson red, or\r\nfrom a pale yellow to dark green and blue, or even black. Colourless\r\ndiamonds are in general most highly esteemed, but coloured stones are\r\nsometimes of an exquisite beauty, and of corresponding value. Blue is an\r\nexceedingly rare colour, and one of this shade, the celebrated Hope\r\ndiamond, which weighs forty-four and a half carats,[70] and unites the\r\ncharming colour of the sapphire with the prismatic fire of the diamond,\r\nis valued at 25,000_l._\r\n\r\nFootnote 70:\r\n\r\n  The carat is equal to 3¼ grains Troy weight.\r\n\r\nAs the rough stones are rarely found with an even or transparent\r\nsurface, the assistance of art is required to develop their full beauty.\r\nThe diamond, being by far the hardest of all substances, can only be cut\r\nand polished by itself. Hence the lapidaries begin their operations by\r\nrubbing several diamonds against each other while rough, after having\r\nfirst glued them to the ends of two wooden blocks thick enough to be\r\nheld in the hand. It is the powder thus rubbed off the stones, and\r\nreceived in a little box for the purpose, that serves to grind and\r\npolish them.\r\n\r\nThe process of diamond-cutting is effected by a horizontal iron plate of\r\nabout ten inches’ diameter, called a _schyf_ or mill, which revolves\r\nfrom two thousand to three thousand times per minute, and is sprinkled\r\nover with diamond dust mixed with oil of olives. The diamond is fixed in\r\na ball of pewter at the end of an arm resting upon the table on which\r\nthe plate revolves; the other end, at which the ball containing the\r\ndiamond is fixed, is pressed upon the wheel by movable weights at the\r\ndiscretion of the workman.\r\n\r\nThe method of cutting and polishing diamonds was unknown in Europe\r\nbefore the fifteenth century, but appears to have been practised long\r\nbefore in India, though in a rude manner. The original facetting of the\r\nKoh-i-Noor was the work of an unknown and prehistoric age.\r\n\r\nThe diamonds which were employed as ornaments before that period, as for\r\ninstance the four large stones which enrich the clasp of the imperial\r\nmantle of Charlemagne, as now preserved in Paris, remained in their\r\nrough and uncut state. The invention is ascribed to Louis von Berguen, a\r\nnative of Bruges, then the great emporium of Western trade and luxury,\r\nwho in the year 1476 cut the fine diamond of Charles the Bold; and ever\r\nsince that time Antwerp and Amsterdam have maintained the first rank in\r\nthe practice of an art which might be supposed to have a more\r\nappropriate seat in London or Paris, the centres of modern wealth and\r\nfashion.\r\n\r\nDiamonds are generally cut either as rose diamonds or as brilliants. The\r\nrose diamond is flat beneath, while the upper face rises into a dome,\r\nand is cut into facets. The brilliant, which is always three times as\r\nthick as the rose diamond, is likewise cut into facets, but so as to\r\nform two pyramids rising from a common central base or _girdle_. Each\r\npyramid is truncated at the top by a section parallel to the girdle,\r\nwhich cuts off -5⁄18 of the whole height from the upper one, and -1⁄18\r\nfrom the lower one. The superior and larger plane thus produced is\r\ncalled the _table_; and the inferior and smaller one is called the\r\n_collet_. Although the rose diamond projects bright beams of light in\r\nmore extensive proportion often than the brilliant, yet the latter shows\r\nan incomparably greater play, from the difference of its cutting. In\r\nexecuting this there are formed thirty-two faces of different figures,\r\nand inclined at different angles all round the table on the upper side\r\nof the stone, while on the under side twenty-four other faces are made\r\nround the small table. It is essential that the faces of the top and the\r\nbottom shall correspond together in sufficiently exact proportions to\r\nmultiply the reflections and refractions, so as to produce the gorgeous\r\ndisplay of prismatic colours which renders the brilliant so pre-\r\neminently beautiful.\r\n\r\nFrom the hardness of the diamond, its cutting is a very tedious and\r\nexpensive operation, requiring more time in the proportion of fifty to\r\none than the cutting of the sapphire, which comes next to it in\r\nhardness.\r\n\r\nExperiment has determined that the diamond consists of pure carbon, so\r\nthat the same substance which in its common black state is utterly\r\nworthless in very small quantities, becomes the most costly of precious\r\nstones, when it makes its appearance in the crystalline form. Already\r\nNewton, by observing the extraordinary refractive power of the diamond,\r\nhad been led to place it among combustibles; but Cosmo III., Grand Duke\r\nof Tuscany, was the first who proved the truth of this bold conjecture\r\nby actual observation. He exposed diamonds to the heat of the powerful\r\nburning glass of Tschîrnhausen, and saw them vanish in a few moments\r\ninto air. The formation of the diamond in nature is one of the many\r\nproblems which ‘our philosophy’ has not yet enabled us to solve. Time is\r\nan element which enters largely into nature’s works; she occupies a\r\nthousand or even thousands of years to produce a result, while man in\r\nhis experiments is confined to a few years at most.\r\n\r\nThe most anciently renowned diamond districts are situated in the Indian\r\npeninsula, in the kingdoms of Golconda and Visapour, extending from Cape\r\nComorin to Bengal, at the foot of a chain of mountains called the Orixa,\r\nwhich appear to belong to the trap-rock formation. Tavernier describes\r\nthem as giving employment to thousands of workmen, but they seem now to\r\nbe all but exhausted.\r\n\r\nWe are but little acquainted with the diamond mines of Landak in Borneo,\r\nthough Ida Pfeiffer, on her second voyage round the world, obtained\r\npermission to visit them, a favour but rarely accorded to strangers by\r\nthe suspicious potentate to whom they belong. So much is certain, that\r\nvery few stones from this quarter find their way to the civilised world,\r\nwhich at present draws its chief supplies from the mines of Serro do\r\nFrio and Sincora in Brazil.\r\n\r\nWhen diamonds were first found in the Serro do Frio, about the beginning\r\nof the last century, the real value of the glittering crystals was so\r\nlittle known that they were made use of as card-marks by the planters of\r\nthe neighbourhood. An inspector of mines, who had been some time in\r\nIndia, was the first who discovered their true nature. Wisely keeping\r\nhis secret to himself, he collected a large quantity of them, and\r\nescaped with his treasure to Europe. In 1729, the governor of Brazil,\r\nDon Lourenço de Almeida, sent some of the transparent stones of the\r\nSerro to the court of Lisbon with the remark that he supposed them to be\r\ndiamonds, and thus the attention of Government was at length attracted\r\nto their value. By a decree of the 8th of February, 1730, the diamond\r\ndistrict was placed under the rule of an Intendant, armed with the most\r\narbitrary powers. Not only all strangers were carefully excluded from\r\nits limits, but not even a Portuguese or a Brazilian was allowed to\r\ntread its forbidden ground without a special permission; its population\r\nwas limited to a scanty number, nor durst the foundation of a new house\r\nbe laid unless in the presence of magistrates and mining inspectors. A\r\nsystem of secret delations was introduced worthy of the worst times of\r\nthe Inquisition, and many an innocent person was banished, imprisoned,\r\nor transported to Africa, without even knowing his accuser, or the\r\ntrespass laid to his charge. In one word despotism seemed to have\r\nexhausted all her inventive powers for the purpose of securing to the\r\nCrown the monopoly of the costliest gem on earth.\r\n\r\nBut in spite of every precaution, it was impossible to put down the\r\ncontraband trade in diamonds. The audacity of the smugglers increased\r\nwith the obstacles placed in their way, so that a far more considerable\r\nquantity of diamonds was secretly sold and exported than ever came into\r\nthe hands of Government. Traversing the deep forests on almost\r\ninaccessible mountain paths, the bold _free-traders_ met, at some place\r\nof appointment, the negroes who had been able to secrete some of the\r\nprecious stones, and paid them a trifle for diamonds which beyond the\r\nlimits of the district were worth at least twenty times the price given.\r\nSometimes even the smugglers searched for diamonds themselves in the\r\nunfrequented wilderness. While some were washing the sands, others kept\r\nwatch upon an eminence, and gave notice of the approach of the soldiers,\r\nwho were constantly patrolling the district.\r\n\r\nThe heaviest penalties could not prevent the inhabitants of the Serra\r\nfrom defrauding the Crown, and Herr von Tschudi (‘Travels in South\r\nAmerica in 1857–1861’) was told many amusing instances of their\r\nsmuggling contrivances. One of them had concealed a diamond of twenty-\r\nfive carats in the handle of his riding whip, for which purpose he had\r\npractised for many weeks the art of plaiting the thin leather straps\r\nwhich covered it, and another had secreted his precious stones in a\r\nkettle with a double bottom.\r\n\r\nWhen the Brazils became an independent country, the monopoly of the\r\ndiamond trade was abandoned by the new Government, and any speculator\r\nwas allowed to search for diamonds on payment of a slight duty. The\r\nprecious stones are found chiefly in alluvial deposits (_Cascalho\r\nvirgem_), in the beds of torrents, or along low river-banks, and\r\nfrequently large quantities of overlying rubbish. (_Cascalho bravo_)\r\nhave to be removed before the diamond-bed can be reached. The mining\r\nlabours are generally performed by slaves, though some of the poorer\r\nminers, or Faiscadores, have no other assistance but that of their own\r\nfamilies. The work varies with the seasons. During the dry period of the\r\nyear the cascalho is removed from the beds of the desiccated brooks, and\r\ndams are raised or canals dug for the purpose of turning off the stream\r\ninto another channel, while the wet season is made use of for washing\r\nthe sands. While this operation is going on, an overseer, seated on a\r\nhigh chair, keeps a sharp look-out upon the negroes; but in spite of all\r\nhis attention, and of the severe punishments that await them in case of\r\ndiscovery, they know how to secrete many a diamond, by rapidly throwing\r\nit into their mouth, and concealing it under their tongue or swallowing\r\nit. In the Portuguese times an Intendant, complaining to the overseers\r\nof the frequency of theft, accused them of negligence, but was told that\r\nno vigilance in the world could prevent it. To convince himself of the\r\nfact, he ordered a negro who enjoyed the reputation of being a most\r\nexpert hand at secreting diamonds to be brought before him, and placing\r\na small stone in a heap of sand, promised him his liberty in case he\r\nshould succeed in appropriating the stone without being detected. The\r\nnegro began to wash the sand according to the usual method, while the\r\nIntendant was observing him all the time with the eyes of a lynx. After\r\na few minutes he asked the slave whether he had found the stone. ‘If the\r\nword of a white man can be trusted,’ answered the black, ‘I am from this\r\nmoment free;’ and taking the diamond out of his mouth, he handed it to\r\nthe Intendant.\r\n\r\nThe negroes employed in the diamond washings are generally hired by the\r\nminers at so many milrees a week. Although their labour is very severe,\r\nthey generally prefer it to any other, as on Sundays and Feast-days they\r\nare allowed to search on their own account (of course in places not\r\npreviously occupied), and have, moreover, an opportunity of stealing\r\ndiamonds.\r\n\r\nThe profits thus lawfully or unlawfully made they generally spend in\r\ndrinking, a slave but very rarely saving money for the purpose of\r\npurchasing his freedom. In the Portuguese times, while the mines were\r\nstill worked on account of Government, a negro who was fortunate enough\r\nto find a stone weighing an oitava (17½ carats) was at once rewarded\r\nwith his liberty; at present only small rewards are given. Formerly most\r\ndiamonds were found in the district of Tejuco, the capital of which\r\nreceived in 1831 the significant name of Diamantina; but in 1844 new\r\nmines were discovered in the Serro do Sincora, in the province of Bahia,\r\nwhose richness eclipses that of the most brilliant times of Tejuco.\r\n\r\nThe total produce of Brazil is estimated at about 300,000 carats,\r\nannually worth on the spot from 300 to 500 milrees the oitava (17½\r\ncarats). The miners rarely make a fortune, as their expenses are very\r\ngreat; the chief profits of the diamond trade fall to the share of the\r\nmerchants, who purchase the stones in the mining districts and then sort\r\nand export them. The price of diamonds is subject to considerable\r\nfluctuations, which, proceeding from the markets of London, Paris, and\r\nAmsterdam, are most sensibly felt in the diamond districts, for the\r\ngreat European houses in whose hands the trade of the rough stones is\r\nconcentrated, and who dispose of considerable capital, are able to wait\r\nfor better times, while the small Brazilian trader or miner is soon\r\nobliged, for want of money, to sell his stones at any price. After the\r\nbreaking out of the Crimean war, diamonds were very much depreciated at\r\nDiamantina. They were offered for sale at absurdly low prices, and even\r\nthen a purchaser was rarely to be found. The market improved very\r\nslowly; but when the war was at an end, the prices once more rose to a\r\nheight which had never been known before. The commercial crisis in North\r\nAmerica and Europe at the end of 1857, and in the beginning of 1858,\r\ncaused a new reaction, the effects of which Tschudi was able to note\r\nduring his stay at Diamantina. ‘Good ware’ (_fazenda regular e boa_),\r\nconsisting of stones averaging a vintem[71] in weight, which a few\r\nmonths before had been paid with 500 milrees the oitava, were now\r\noffered for 300. A stone of six vintems was sold in March 1858 for 170\r\nmilrees; six months before it would have been worth 240 or 260.\r\n\r\nFootnote 71:\r\n\r\n  In the Brazilian diamond trade, the oitava (17½ carats) is considered\r\n  as the unity of weight. It is subdivided into 4 quartas or 32 vintems;\r\n  the vintem is equal to 2-18⁄100 grains. Stones of half a vintem still\r\n  pass as good ware (_fazenda ainda boa_), when well-shaped and\r\n  colourless. Middling ware (_fazenda mediana_) consists of from 64 to\r\n  100 stones to the oitava, while all below that weight is sold as\r\n  refuse.\r\n\r\nWhile the price of the smaller stones of about a vintem or less is\r\nregulated by the exporters in Rio, conjointly with the European houses,\r\nfancy prices are asked at Diamantina for larger stones of several\r\ncarats. A fine diamond of an oitava sells for about three contos of rees\r\n(360_l._), and one of two oitavas, or thirty-five carats, is often sold\r\non the spot for ten to twelve contos (1200_l._-1440_l._).\r\n\r\nDuring the last thirty years, diamonds have risen about forty per cent.\r\nin price in Europe, a natural consequence of the increase of wealth and\r\nluxury while the supply of the article continues to be limited. As,\r\nhowever, many large stones have recently been found in South Africa, and\r\nAustralia now adds the diamond to her many sources of natural wealth,\r\nits value will probably once more decline.\r\n\r\nWhen cut and polished, a brilliant of the first or purest water in\r\nEngland, weighing one carat, is valued at 12_l._, a rose diamond of the\r\nsame weight at 8_l._, while the value of all those of a larger size is\r\ncalculated by multiplying the square of the weight in carats by twelve\r\nor eight, except for those exceeding twenty carats, the price of which\r\nincreases at a much more rapid rate. The enormous value ascribed to\r\nlarge diamonds is, however, merely fanciful, for they are worth neither\r\nmore nor less than what purchasers may be inclined or able to give for\r\nthem. According to the above valuation, stones weighing 100 carats would\r\nbe worth at least (100 × 100 = 10,000 × 12) 120,000_l._; a sum which has\r\nprobably never yet been paid for a diamond of that weight. A very\r\ntrifling spot or flaw of any kind lowers exceedingly the commercial\r\nvalue of a diamond. The number of large diamonds is very small. Among\r\nten thousand stones, the Brazilian mines furnish but one that weighs ten\r\ncarats; diamonds above twenty carats are very rare, and in all Europe\r\nthere are but five diamonds of more than one hundred carats.\r\n\r\nThe largest of these is the magnificent gem of the first water, without\r\nfault or blemish, which sparkles in the Imperial sceptre of Russia. It\r\nweighs 194¾ carats; its largest diameter is one inch three lines and a\r\nhalf; its height ten lines. It is of East Indian origin, and once\r\nfigured with another similar stone in the throne of Nadir Shah. When\r\nthis tyrant was murdered, it was stolen, and ultimately came into the\r\npossession of an American merchant named Schafrass, who purchased it\r\nwith several other valuable stones of an Afghan chieftain in Bagdad, for\r\nthe round sum of 50,000 piasters. In 1772 the Empress Catharine II.\r\nbought the diamond of Schafrass, who had meanwhile settled in Amsterdam,\r\nfor 450,000 silver roubles and a patent of nobility.\r\n\r\nOf somewhat smaller size, but of unparallelled beauty, is the\r\nmagnificent diamond called the Pitt or Regent, which Mr. Pitt,\r\ngrandfather of the famous Lord Chatham, into whose possession it had\r\ncome while governor of Madras, sold to the Duke of Orleans, Regent of\r\nFrance, for 135,000_l._ having himself paid 12,500_l._ for it to\r\nTamohund, the most famous native dealer in India. It originally weighed\r\n410 carats, but has been reduced to 136¾ by cutting it into a brilliant—\r\nan operation which is said to have lasted two years. It is now the first\r\namong the jewels belonging to the French Government; Napoleon used to\r\nwear it in the hilt of his sword.\r\n\r\nDuring the five years the stone remained in his possession, Governor\r\nPitt is said to have lived in such constant dread of having it stolen,\r\nthat he never made known beforehand the day of his coming to town, nor\r\nslept two nights following in the same house. If this story be true,\r\ngreat indeed must have been his relief when he parted with his gem,\r\nwhich, though small in weight, was to him a true millstone in anxiety.\r\n\r\nThe diamond of the Grand Duke of Tuscany, which weighs 139½ carats, and\r\nis consequently a trifle larger than the Regent, once belonged to\r\nCharles the Bold of Burgundy, and at the battle of Nancy fell into the\r\nhands of an ignorant trooper, who plucked the gem from the helmet of the\r\nunfortunate duke and sold it for a crown. At a later period it came into\r\nthe possession of the Court of Tuscany, and is now the first crown jewel\r\nof the Emperor of Austria.\r\n\r\nThe most celebrated diamond in the world is undoubtedly the Koh-i-Noor,\r\nor ‘mountain of light,’ which, according to Hindu legend, was worn by\r\none of the heroes of the Great War which took place about four thousand\r\nyears ago, and which forms the subject of the epic poem the Maha-\r\nBhârata. After numberless vicissitudes and peregrinations, we find it in\r\nthe possession of the Grand Moguls, and in 1739 in that of Nadir Shah,\r\nwho, on his occupation of Delhi, compelled Mohammed Shah, the great-\r\ngrandson of Aurungzeb, to give up to him all the valuables contained in\r\nthe imperial treasury. According to the family and popular tradition,\r\nMohammed Shah was imprudent enough to wear the Koh-i-Noor in front of\r\nhis turban at his interview with his conqueror, who being\r\n\r\n                      ‘the mildest-mannered man\r\n                With all true breeding of a gentleman,’\r\n\r\ninsisted on exchanging turbans in proof of his regard; and is said to\r\nhave bestowed upon the diamond thus politely annexed the name of Koh-i-\r\nNoor. After the fall of his dynasty, the stone became the property of\r\nAhmed Shah, the founder of the Abdali dynasty of Kabul, and, when Mr.\r\nElphinstone was at Peshawur, was worn by his successor Shah Shuja, on\r\nhis arm. When Shah Shuja was driven from Kabul, he became the nominal\r\nguest and actual prisoner of Runjeet Singh, who, following the good\r\nexample of Nadir Shah, _gently_ persuaded his protegé to part with his\r\ndiamond for the revenues of three villages, not one rupee of which he\r\never realised. ‘By what do you estimate its value?’ asked the Sikh\r\nMaharajah of his victim, as the surrendered Koh-i-Noor lay on the arm of\r\nhis new master. ‘By its good luck,‘ said Shah Shuja, ‘for it hath ever\r\nbeen his who hath conquered his enemies.’\r\n\r\nSubsequent events fully proved the truth of this remark, for when the\r\nPunjab was annexed by the British Government, it was stipulated among\r\nother conditions that the Koh-i-Noor should be presented to the Queen of\r\nEngland. But in spite of its promising name, the ‘Mountain of Light’ was\r\nbut of inferior lustre, for the Orientals are mere bunglers in the art\r\nof diamond-cutting, and lay greater weight upon the size than upon the\r\nbrilliancy of a jewel. Hence it was resolved to have it recut by the\r\nmost skilful Amsterdam lapidaries, who came over to England for the\r\npurpose. The operation, which was performed with the assistance of a\r\nsmall steam-engine, and cost no less than 5,000_l._, was perfectly\r\nsuccessful; and though the Koh-i-Noor, which formerly weighed 186¼\r\ncarats, has been reduced by its conversion into a brilliant of 102-3⁄16\r\ncarats, it has gained so much in lustre that it now fully deserves the\r\nname assigned to it by the hyperbolical phraseology of the East.\r\n\r\nAll these large diamonds originally came from India; but latterly they\r\nhave been rivalled by a stone of Brazilian origin, originally weighing\r\n254½ carats, but reduced by cutting to 125, which has received the\r\npoetical name of ‘Estrella do Sul’ or Star of the South. It is a\r\nsingular fact that as yet this beautiful gem has brought good luck to\r\nnone of its possessors. An old negro woman accidentally found it in a\r\ndiamond mine at the Rio da Bagagem, in Minas Geraes, among a heap of\r\npebbles that had been previously washed. She gave it to her master, who\r\ndid not even reward her with her liberty, and superstition has traced\r\nall the ill-luck attached to the stone to that ungenerous act. The first\r\nproprietor of the diamond was a needy man, who for a trifling sum had\r\nbeen allowed by the proprietor of the mine to search for stones with the\r\nfew slaves he possessed. The proprietor now claimed the diamond,\r\nalleging that it had not been found on the premises hired by the former;\r\nand a law suit, profitable of course to none but the lawyers, was the\r\nconsequence. To be able to defend his cause, the possessor of the stone\r\npawned it to the Brazilian Bank for about 8,000_l._, for which he had to\r\npay fifteen per cent. commission and a high interest.\r\n\r\nThe law suit, as may naturally be supposed, lasted so long that the man\r\ndied before it was decided, and but a very small sum of money remained\r\nto his widow. After passing through several hands, the stone was\r\npurchased at Rio for a million of francs, by a Dutch jeweller, who, to\r\nmake up this considerable sum, was obliged to borrow money at the usual\r\nhigh interest of the place. He took the stone with him to Amsterdam,\r\nwhere it was cut, at an expense of about 4,000_l._ The great desideratum\r\nnow was to find a purchaser for the magnificent jewel, which, however,\r\ndid not prove of the first water. It was offered for sale to several\r\ncrowned heads, and no princely bridal was allowed to pass without an\r\nattempt to dispose of the ‘Star of the South;’ but all efforts proved\r\nfruitless, for it seems that the monarchs of our days are of opinion\r\nthat the exorbitant sums formerly paid for diamonds of an uncommon size\r\nmay be invested in a much more profitable manner. The unfortunate\r\nspeculator died of a broken heart. By the latest accounts the stone is\r\nstill in Paris, held in pawn by a commercial house, which most probably\r\nwill keep it, as the accumulated interest of years must of course absorb\r\nits whole value.\r\n\r\nThe uncut stone belonging to the King of Portugal, and weighing 1,680\r\ncarats, is now well known to be not, as was supposed, the greatest\r\ndiamond in the world, but a mere white topaz. The quality of another\r\nstone of 138½ carats, found near the Rio Abaete in 1791, and likewise in\r\nthe Portuguese treasury, has not been determined. So much, however, is\r\ncertain, that the Portuguese Crown possesses (or possessed a few years\r\nago) the richest collection of diamonds in the world, the value of which\r\nwas estimated at about 3,000,000_l._(?) Of all the stones annually sent\r\nto Lisbon by the General Intendant of the diamond districts, the king\r\nselected the largest and finest for the royal treasury, and the others\r\nwere sold. When King Joao VI. returned in 1821 from Brazil to Portugal,\r\nhe carried along with him almost as many diamonds as Voltaire’s Candide\r\non his escape from Eldorado. The jewels were deposited in sealed bags in\r\nthe vaults of the Lisbon Bank, where they remained forty years as a dead\r\ncapital. In 1863 it was at length very wisely resolved, with the consent\r\nof the Cortes, to sell these rough diamonds, and to invest the proceeds\r\nfor the benefit of the civil list.\r\n\r\nThough diamonds are usually washed out from the soil, yet they also\r\ngenerally occur in regions that afford a laminated granular quartz rock,\r\ncalled _Itacolumite_, which in thin slabs is translucent and more or\r\nless flexible. This rock occurs in the mines of Brazil and the Urals,\r\nand also in Georgia and North Carolina, where a few diamonds have been\r\nfound. Before taking leave of the prince of gems, I will not omit\r\nmentioning that it is not only the costliest of all ornaments, but\r\nserves also for several more humble though more useful purposes, as for\r\ncutting glass by the glazier, and all kinds of hard stones by the\r\nlapidary. Small drills are made either of imperfect diamonds, or of\r\nfragments split off from good stones in their manufacture for jewelling.\r\nThey are used for drilling small holes in rubies and other hard stones,\r\nfor piercing holes in china where rivets are to be inserted, or in any\r\nother vitreous substance, however hard. Diamonds have also been recently\r\nused for arming the end of the borer in a new rock-boring machine, for\r\nscooping out holes in the hardest rocks, such as granite and porphyry.\r\nThe use of diamond dust within a few years has increased very materially\r\nwith the increased demand for all articles wrought by it, such as cameos\r\nand intaglios.\r\n\r\nThe mineral substance that ranks next to the diamond, whether we\r\nestimate it by its hardness, the splendour of its colour, or its\r\nrareness, is that called by the mineralogists Corundum. It consists of\r\npure crystallised alumina (the oxide of the now well-known metal\r\naluminium), variously tinted by the addition of small quantities of iron\r\nor chromium. To this class belong the ruby, the sapphire, the topaz, the\r\nemerald, the amethyst, and other stones of gorgeous colour,\r\ndistinguished by the epithet ‘oriental’ prefixed to the name.\r\n\r\nThe Oriental Ruby, or Red Sapphire, is the red stone _par excellence_ of\r\njewellery, and, from its fiery lustre, probably identical with the\r\ncarbuncle of Pliny, and the anthrax or ‘burning coal’ of Theophrastus.\r\nIts finest colour is a most rich and lovely crimson, known as the\r\npigeon’s blood tint; but its scarlet tints are also most beautiful. The\r\nred rays of the prism falling on a ruby produce a charming effect. Pegu\r\nis the land of rubies, and Australia now likewise furnishes stones of\r\nexcellent quality. A perfect ruby above three and a half carats is more\r\nvaluable than a diamond of the same weight. If it weigh one carat it is\r\nworth ten guineas; two carats, forty guineas; three carats, one hundred\r\nand fifty guineas; six carats, above one thousand guineas. The largest\r\noriental ruby known to be in the world was brought from China to Prince\r\nGagarin, Governor of Siberia. It came afterwards into the possession of\r\nPrince Menschikoff, and is now a jewel in the imperial crown of Russia.\r\n\r\nThe blue variety of the corundum is the Oriental Sapphire of the\r\njeweller. There is one hue of it of a soft pure azure, distinguished\r\nfrom the commoner kinds by its retaining its fine blue even by\r\ncandlelight, when an ordinary sapphire looks purple or black. Unlike the\r\nruby, it occurs in specimens of a considerable size. A good blue stone\r\nof ten carats is valued at fifty guineas. If it weighs twenty carats its\r\nvalue is two hundred guineas, but under ten carats the price may be\r\nestimated by multiplying the square of its weight in carats into half a\r\nguinea; thus one of four carats would be worth eight guineas. A sapphire\r\nof a barbel-blue colour, weighing six carats, was disposed of in Paris\r\nby public sale for 70_l._; and another of an indigo blue, weighing 6\r\ncarats and 3 grains, brought 60_l._, both of which sums much exceed what\r\nthe preceding rule assigns, from which we may perceive how far fancy may\r\ngo in such matters.\r\n\r\nThe Spinels, whose transparent and more precious forms consist\r\nessentially of alumina combined with magnesia, and tinted perhaps with\r\niron, include two resplendent stones, the Spinel Ruby, a scarlet variety\r\nof considerable fire and of rich colour, and the Balais or Balass Ruby,\r\nthus called from one of the most celebrated localities of the spinel in\r\nformer times, namely Beloochistan or Balastan. The latter is of a\r\ndelicate and rarely deep rose-colour, showing a blue tint when looked\r\nthrough, and a redder one when it is looked at. Both of these minerals\r\nare termed rubies by the jewellers, and the deeper-tinted kinds are\r\nsometimes sold for the true stone. In fact, nearly all the large and\r\nfamous gems that pass under the name of rubies belong to this species,\r\nas for instance the ancient ruby in the crown of England, which was\r\npresented to Edward the Black Prince by Don Pedro the Cruel, and the\r\nenormous stone, time-honoured in Indian tradition, that came along with\r\nthe Koh-i-Noor into Her Majesty’s possession. Such was the superstitious\r\nvalue attached to it by its former proprietor, Runjeet Singh, that he\r\nwould sooner have lost a province than this stone. When the weight of a\r\ngood spinel exceeds four carats, it is said to be valued at half the\r\nprice of a diamond of the same weight.\r\n\r\nThe Chrysoberyl, called also by the jewellers the Oriental Chrysolite,\r\nis a stone of almost adamantine lustre and transparence. It is a\r\ncompound of alumina and the rare oxide glucina, a constituent of the\r\nberyl. It has usually a peculiar, sometimes a very delicate greenish\r\nyellow or primrose colour, and is then one of the most beautiful of\r\ngems. The finer specimens are from Brazil.\r\n\r\nThe Emerald and the Beryl are one and the same mineral—a silicate of\r\nalumina and glucina, which owes to a small trace of iron its blue, pink,\r\nor yellow tints, or else to a little chromium the transcendent green\r\nwhich characterises it as the emerald. The colour of this beautiful gem\r\nis so pleasant to the eye that the ancients attributed to it the power\r\nof strengthening and relieving the sight when fatigued by previous\r\nexertions. Both from its beauty and rareness they held it in high\r\nestimation, and Pliny ranks the emerald in value immediately after the\r\ndiamond and the oriental pearl. In the Egyptian tombs real emeralds are\r\nsometimes found as the ornaments of regal mummies, and they have not\r\nseldom been discovered among the ruins of Rome, or at Herculaneum and\r\nPompeii. Scythia, Bactria, and Egypt were renowned among the ancients as\r\nthe countries which furnished the most beautiful emeralds. At present\r\nthese precious stones are obtained chiefly from New Granada and Siberia,\r\nin which latter country they occur of much larger size, but of less\r\nbeauty, and consequently far inferior value. The first Siberian emeralds\r\nwere discovered in the year 1831, in the neighbourhood of\r\nCatharinenburg, by some peasants, while making tar, and other mines were\r\nopened in 1834 ten versts distant from the former. Here was found an\r\nenormous stone, fourteen inches long and twelve broad, and weighing 16¾\r\nlbs. troy, and another superb specimen consisting of twenty crystals,\r\nfrom half an inch to five inches long, and as much as two inches thick,\r\nembedded in a matrix of mica-schist. Both these monstrous gems now rank\r\namong the chief ornaments of the Imperial Mineralogical Cabinet.\r\n\r\nWhen the Spaniards conquered Peru, they found many beautiful emeralds in\r\nthe possession of the natives. The largest of these stones, about the\r\nsize of an ostrich egg, was adored as a god in one of the temples, and\r\nother emeralds of a smaller size placed around it were honoured as its\r\nchildren. In their blind fanaticism, the otherwise greedy Spaniards\r\nshivered the god and his family to pieces, but it is more than probable\r\nthat the wisest of the band quietly picked up the fragments and\r\nafterwards disposed of them to advantage. The finest stones used to be\r\nfound in the valley of Manta; but the Indians kept the mines secret, to\r\navoid being obliged to work in them, or perhaps out of hatred against\r\ntheir oppressors. At present, the American emeralds are chiefly obtained\r\nfrom the valley of Tunka, in the province of Santa Fé de Bogota, in New\r\nGranada.\r\n\r\nThe price of emeralds varies considerably, according to their purity,\r\nthe beauty of their colour, their lustre, and their size. Before the\r\ndiscovery of America, they were uncommonly dear, all knowledge of the\r\nold mines having been lost, so that the emeralds still used as ornaments\r\nwere all ancient. Afterwards their value decreased, when a greater\r\nquantity was imported from Peru; but recently they have again risen in\r\nprice, as America at present furnishes but few good stones. A splendid\r\nspecimen in the possession of Mr. Hope, weighing six ounces, cost\r\n500_l._; another fine American emerald belonging to the Duke of\r\nDevonshire is two inches long, and weighs above eight ounces, but, owing\r\nto flaws, it is but partially fit for jewellery.\r\n\r\nThe Beryl, which exhibits every gradation of tint, from a pale azure\r\nblue to a fine mountain green, and also occurs in a pale orange yellow\r\nvariety, is found in great perfection at Oduntschilon and Mursinsk in\r\nSiberia. A beautifully clear crystal, ten inches long, discovered in the\r\nlatter locality in 1828, and forming part of the mineralogical museum at\r\nPetersburg, is valued at 8,000_l._ Formerly Brazil and Cangayum in the\r\nDeccan were in much repute as fields in which the beryl was found, and\r\nmany a brilliant little stone has been furnished by the Mourne Mountains\r\nin Ireland.\r\n\r\nThe Zircon consists of the mixed oxides of silicon and of the rare\r\nelement zirconium, and is one of the heaviest and most lustrous of gem-\r\nstones. Its colourless variety is the nearest match in brilliancy and\r\nrefractive energy for the diamond, while the deep orange-tinted red\r\nzircon is that transcendent gem, the true hyacinth, which makes a very\r\nsuperb ring-stone.\r\n\r\nThe Topaz, a silicate of alumina and fluorine, is found chiefly in\r\nSiberia, Brazil, and Saxony, and is also met with in the granitic\r\ndetritus of Cairngorm in Aberdeenshire. The colourless Brazilian variety\r\n(_Pingo d’agoa_, or waterdrop) surpasses rock-crystal in purity and\r\nrefractive power, and being of the same weight as the diamond, is\r\nsometimes mistaken for it. The pale yellow topaz when heated in a\r\ncrucible assumes a rose-red colour, and is then called by the jewellers\r\nruby of Brazil. The Saxon topaz, on the other hand, becomes white when\r\nexposed to heat, and thus deprived of colour is sold for the diamond. In\r\nancient times the topaz was highly esteemed; but, in spite of its\r\nbeauty, it is not now considered of very great value, from its being too\r\nfrequently found, and is sold in the rough for about forty shillings per\r\npound.\r\n\r\nWhen of a beautiful ‘forget-me-not’ blue, and above the size of a pea,\r\nthe Oriental Turquoise, which in inferior specimens is but of little\r\nvalue, fetches a considerable price, so that fine stones of about half\r\nan inch in length are worth 15_l._ or 20_l._ The turquoise, which\r\nconsists of phosphate of alumina coloured by oxide of copper, occurs\r\nchiefly in the mountainous range of Persia, whence it is brought by the\r\nmerchants of Bochara to Moskau; but the Shah is said to retain for his\r\nown use all the larger and finely tinted specimens.\r\n\r\nMajor Macdonald gives the following account of a new field for the\r\nturquoise which he discovered in Arabia Petræa. ‘In the year 1849,\r\nduring my travels in Arabia in search of antiquities, I was led to\r\nexamine a very lofty range of mountains, composed of iron sandstone,\r\nmany days’ journey in the desert; and whilst descending a mountain of\r\nabout six thousand feet high, by a deep and precipitous gorge, which in\r\nthe winter time served to carry off the water, I found a bed of gravel,\r\nwhere I perceived a great many small blue objects mixed with the other\r\nstones; on collecting them I found they were turquoises of the finest\r\ncolour and quality. On continuing my researches through the entire range\r\nof mountains, I discovered many valuable deposits of the same stones,\r\nsome quite pure in pebbles, and others in the matrix. The action of the\r\nweather gradually loosens them from the rock, and they are rolled into\r\nthe ravines, and, in the winter season, mixed up by the torrents with\r\nbeds of gravel, where they are found.’\r\n\r\nThe Occidental or Bone Turquoise, which has generally but one-fourth of\r\nthe value of the oriental, is said to be fossil bones or teeth, coloured\r\nwith oxide of copper.\r\n\r\nThe Garnet, a silicate of some base which may be lime, magnesia, oxide\r\nof iron, or chromium, is in its finer specimens one of the most\r\nbeautiful coloured products of nature’s laboratory. By jewellers the\r\ngarnets are classed as Syrian, Bohemian, or Cingalese, rather from their\r\nrelative value and fineness than with any reference to the country from\r\nwhich they are supposed to have been brought. Those most esteemed are\r\ncalled Syrian garnets, not because they come from Syria, but after\r\nSyrian, the capital of Pegu, which city was formerly the chief mart for\r\nthe finest garnets. Their colour is violet purple, which in some rare\r\ninstances vies with that of the finest oriental amethyst; but it may be\r\ndistinguished from the latter by acquiring an orange tint by\r\ncandlelight. The Bohemian garnet is generally of a dull poppy-red\r\ncolour, with a very perceptible hyacinth orange tint, when held between\r\nthe eye and the light. When the colour is a full crimson, it is called\r\npyrope or fire-garnet, a stone of considerable value when perfect and of\r\nlarge size. Garnet is easily worked, and when facet-cut is nearly always\r\n(on account of the depth of its colour) formed into thin tables, which\r\nare sometimes concave or hollowed out on the under side. Cut stones of\r\nthis latter kind, when skilfully set, with a bright silver foil, have\r\noften been sold as rubies.\r\n\r\nThough Lapis Lazuli, a silicate of soda, lime, and alumina, with the\r\nsulphide of iron and sodium in minute quantities, is without\r\ntransparency, and without much lustre, yet its beautiful azure-blue\r\ntints, often interspersed with yellow specks, and veins of iron pyrites,\r\nwhich, from their brilliant appearance in the comparatively dull blue\r\nstone, might easily be mistaken for gold, entitle it to be ranked among\r\nthe semi-precious stones. The finest quality, which sells in the mass\r\nfor 30_l._ per pound, is used for jewellery, and for making costly vases\r\nand ornamental furniture. Lapis lazuli was also the source from which\r\nthe beautiful pigment ultramarine was obtained; but this colour is now\r\nprepared artificially at a very cheap rate. This beautiful mineral is\r\nfound in crystalline limestone of a greyish colour on the banks of the\r\nIndus, and in granite in Persia, China, and Siberia.\r\n\r\nIn the long list of the crystalline or hyaline quartzes, consisting of\r\nsilex or silica in various degrees of purity, there is but one variety,\r\nthe Noble Opal, that ranks among precious stones of the first quality.\r\nIn this beautiful gem, minute fissures are apparently striated with\r\nmicroscopic lines, which, diffracting the light, flash out rainbow tints\r\nof the purest and most brilliant hues. The Noble Opal, which is one of\r\nthe favourite jewels of modern times, was no less highly esteemed by the\r\nancients, ‘for in this stone,’ says Pliny, ‘we admire the fire of the\r\nruby, the brilliant purple of the amethyst, the lustrous green of the\r\nemerald, all shining together in a wonderful mixture.’ For the sake of a\r\nmagnificent opal, set in a ring, and valued at 20,000_l._ of our money,\r\nthe senator Nonius was exiled by Mark Antony. He might have escaped\r\nbanishment by presenting his opal to the covetous triumvir; but he\r\npreferred exile with his gem to staying in Rome without it.\r\n\r\nThe Precious Opal is so rare a stone that, with all our mining\r\nenterprise and geological research, we know of only two certain\r\nlocalities for it, namely, in Hungary and in Mexico, though some\r\nspecimens are said to have been found in the province of Honduras and in\r\nthe stormy Feroe Islands. The opal mines of Hungary, situated at\r\nCzernewitza, in the county of Saros, belong to the Crown, and are at\r\npresent farmed by Herr Goldschmidt of Vienna, for 10,000 florins\r\nannually. About 150 workmen are employed, and as good stones occur but\r\nrarely, and are of a corresponding value, it may easily be imagined\r\nthat, what with the constant fear of being robbed, and that of not being\r\nable to cover his expenses, poor Herr Goldschmidt is no less to be\r\npitied than Governor Pitt while in possession of his diamond.\r\n\r\nThe finest and largest opal in the world is in the Imperial\r\nMineralogical Cabinet in Vienna. It has the most magnificent play of\r\ncolours, chiefly green and red, weighs seventeen ounces, and is\r\nirregularly cut, so as not to diminish the mass. An Amsterdam jeweller\r\nis said to have offered half a million of florins for this unique gem.\r\nUnfortunately, its large size prevents its being used as an ornament, as\r\nfor this purpose it would have to be cut to pieces, which would be an\r\nunpardonable piece of Vandalism.\r\n\r\nTheir relative beauty increases the value of opals so considerably that\r\nfine stones of a moderate bulk have, in modern times, been frequently\r\nsold at the price of diamonds of equal size. The so-called ‘Mountain of\r\nLight,’ an Hungarian opal in the Great Exhibition of 1851, weighed 526½\r\ncarats, and was estimated at 4,000_l._ The black opals, which allow the\r\nred fire of the ruby to flash out from the dark ground-colour of the\r\nstone, are also highly esteemed. Besides the commoner varieties of opal,\r\nsuch as semi-opal, opal jasper, wood opal, different kinds of quartz\r\ncrystal, including amethyst, Cairngorm stone, and a long and beautiful\r\narray of jaspers and chalcedonies, such as agate, onyx, sard, plasma,\r\nand chrysoprase, may be placed in a list of stones of the second degree\r\nin point of value, if that value be estimated by rarity and price.\r\n\r\nThe cutting, or grinding and polishing of most of these stones, which\r\nare commonly comprised under the name of agates, is chiefly carried on\r\nin the small towns of Oberstein and Idar, situated in the picturesque\r\nvalley through which the rapid Idar flows into the Nahe, a tributary of\r\nthe Rhine. The sterile soil yields but a scanty produce, but the\r\nneighbouring hills abound in chalcedonies, which afford the people an\r\nample indemnity for the barrenness of their land. As early as the\r\nfourteenth century, the art of agate-cutting was introduced into this\r\nremote valley, from Italy, where it had long been practised; but for a\r\nlong time the trade was conducted in a very rude manner. The workmen\r\nthemselves undertook the sale of their ware, and wandered as pedlars to\r\nthe neighbouring castles or towns, where they could hope to dispose of\r\ntheir agates to the best advantage. It was not before the middle of the\r\nlast century that the industry of Oberstein made a considerable\r\nprogress. Gold and silversmiths settled in the small town to set the\r\nstones as they came out of the hands of the grinders, and gradually a\r\nmore wealthy class of traders was formed, who undertook long voyages,\r\nand extended their operations to distant countries. The fairs of\r\nFrankfort and Leipzig were regularly attended by the merchants of\r\nOberstein and Idar, and some of them even ventured as far as Smyrna or\r\nArchangel. The taste and the ability of the workmen improved as their\r\nmarket extended, but now the want of the raw material began to be felt.\r\nThe neighbouring hills were no longer able to meet the demand, the\r\nstones continually rose in price, the better qualities could hardly be\r\nprocured, and thus the agate manufactory was menaced with decline, when\r\na fortunate circumstance gave it a new impulse.\r\n\r\nSome of the inhabitants of Idar who in 1827 had emigrated to Brazil\r\ndiscovered in their new home an inexhaustible supply of stones. Enormous\r\nmasses of chalcedony were found scattered as boulders near the banks of\r\nsome rivers or disseminated in the plains, and could be sent as ballast\r\nat a trifling expense across the ocean. Thus almost all the rough\r\nmaterial that Oberstein needs comes at present from Brazil or even\r\nIndia, and only the rarer varieties of agate-jaspis are at present\r\ncollected in the neighbourhood of Idar. In possession of the best\r\nmaterials, supplied by a number of localities, and comprising all\r\nimaginable varieties of chalcedony—carnelion, plasma, heliotrope,\r\njaspis, rock-crystal, amethyst, topaz, lapis lazuli, malachite—and\r\ncommanding a market which extends further and further over the globe,\r\nthe prosperity of Oberstein and Idar steadily increases. One hundred and\r\neighty-three water-mills (with 724 large grinding-stones), situated\r\nalong the romantic Idar, give employment to about 3,000 workmen, and the\r\nvalue of the manufactured stones amounts to at least 220,000_l._\r\nannually.\r\n\r\nNo stones are so porous or so easily coloured by artificial means as the\r\nvarieties of chalcedony. In ancient times the onyxes from the Nerbudda\r\nwere ‘baked in ovens,’ and to this day, in the neighbourhood of Brooch,\r\nthe nodules of onyx dug in the dry season from the beds of torrents are\r\npacked in earthen pots with dry goat’s-dung, which is set on fire. By\r\nthis baking process the grey or dark green iron hydrate which permeates\r\ntheir pores and gives them a dull colour is changed into the red oxyde,\r\nwhich imparts to the improved stones rich hues of orange and hyacinthine\r\nred, and the more ornamental of the mottled onyxes that come from Cambay\r\nare those thus artificially beautified.\r\n\r\nThe art of baking and colouring is now fully understood in Oberstein.\r\nSome agates consist of impermeable white bands or layers alternating\r\nwith others of a grey or dull colour, and of a porous nature. When\r\nplaced in honey and exposed to a moderate heat for eight or ten days,\r\nthe saccharine matter penetrates into the microscopical pores. Then the\r\nstones are boiled in sulphuric acid, which, carbonising the honey,\r\nimparts a deep black colour to the porous layers which it had permeated,\r\nand by thus setting-off the white layers to the best advantage, changes\r\na previously almost worthless stone into a beautiful onyx or sardonyx.\r\nAn Italian who came to Oberstein to buy rough agates for the cameo-\r\ncutters of Rome made the Germans acquainted with this method, which had\r\nlong been practised by his countrymen. By other chemical processes, some\r\nof which are generally known, while others are kept a secret, rich\r\nyellow, or apple-green, or blue tints are imparted by the agate-dealers\r\nof Oberstein to the rough produce of nature. A description of all the\r\nvarieties of quartz used for ornamental purposes would lead me too far;\r\nbut a few words on rock-crystal may not be uninteresting.\r\n\r\nThis beautiful mineral occurs in many varieties, such as the violet,\r\nrock-crystal, or amethyst, the most beautiful specimens of which are\r\nprocured from India, Ceylon, and Persia; the false topaz when yellow,\r\nthe morion when black, the smoky quartz when smoke-brown. The limpid and\r\ncolourless kinds are often called Bristol or Irish diamonds, after the\r\nvarious localities in which they are found. Rock-crystal frequently\r\noccurs in the Alps, as is well known to every traveller in Switzerland.\r\nSmall rock-crystals have hardly any value, but considerable prices are\r\npaid for very large specimens, which are accordingly much sought for by\r\nchamois-hunters and goatherds. About a century since a quartz cave was\r\nopened at Zinken, which afforded 1,000 cwt. of rock-crystal, and at that\r\nearly period brought 300,000 dollars. One crystal weighed 800 pounds.\r\n\r\nIn 1867 a party of tourists, descending from the solitudes of the\r\nGalenstock, discovered, in a band of white quartz traversing a\r\nprecipitous rock-wall about a hundred feet above the Tiefen Glacier,\r\nsome dark spots which the guide, Peter Sulzer, of Guttannen, declared to\r\nbe cavities in which undoubtedly rock-crystals would be found. The\r\nweather being unpropitious, no search was made at the time; but a few\r\nweeks after Sulzer and his son revisited the spot, and after having\r\nclambered up to the holes with great difficulty, found that they\r\ncommunicated with a dark cavity, from which the intrepid explorers\r\nextracted some pieces of black rock-crystal with the curved handles of\r\ntheir alpenstocks.\r\n\r\nIn the August of the following year the Sulzers, accompanied by a few\r\nfriends from Guttannen, to whom they had imparted the secret, made a\r\nmore decisive attempt to force their way into the cave, by widening the\r\nentrance with gunpowder. To clamber and maintain one’s position on a\r\nnearly vertical rock on ledges only a few inches broad is at all times a\r\nmatter of no small difficulty; but this difficulty is very much\r\nincreased when at the same time the hammer and other implements for\r\nblasting are to be handled. The weather was also very bad, and every now\r\nand then a dreadful gust of wind threatened to hurl the hardy\r\nadventurers from the rock upon the glacier. Hail and rain stiffened\r\ntheir limbs; and thus they passed a miserable night closely huddled\r\ntogether on a narrow projection before the cavity. Wet to the skin, and\r\ntheir teeth chattering with cold, they resumed their labours on the\r\nfollowing morning, and at length sufficiently widened the entrance to\r\nopen a passage into a cave which was found to penetrate to a\r\nconsiderable depth into the mountain. The cave was filled nearly up to\r\nits roof with a mound consisting of pieces of granite and quartz mixed\r\nwith chlorite sand; but here and there, imbedded in the rubbish,\r\nglistened the large planes of jet black morions which showed that their\r\ntoil had not been fruitless. Originally the crystals had grown from the\r\nsides or the roof of the cave; and who can tell the ages that were\r\nrequired for their formation, or the mysterious circumstances that\r\nfavoured their growth?—then at an equally unknown time the concussion of\r\nan earthquake, or maybe their own weight, had detached them from the\r\nrock to which they clung, and precipitated them upon the floor. Upon the\r\nwhole more than a thousand large crystals were found in the cave, many\r\nof them weighing from fifty pounds to more than three cwt.\r\n\r\nAfter the first explorers had collected about a ton, the whole able-\r\nbodied population of Guttannen, provided with hammers, spades, ropes,\r\nbaskets, and trucks, came forth to carry away the remainder. As the\r\nreport had spread that the Canton of Uri, on whose territory the cave\r\nwas situated, intended to stop their proceedings, they worked night and\r\nday with feverish haste, and in the space of a week had entirely\r\nstripped it of its treasures, which were partly conveyed to the new\r\nFurca Road, and partly transported over the glaciers to the Grimsel. One\r\nof the party fell into a crevice with a crystal of a hundred pounds upon\r\nhis back, but extricated himself, though he was obliged to abandon his\r\nprize. Thus when the authorities from Uri made their appearance on the\r\nspot nearly all the crystals had been removed out of their reach. Seven\r\nof the finest specimens, each rejoicing in an individual name, like the\r\nmammoth-trees of America, now form a magnificent group in the museum of\r\nBerne, to which they were sold for 8,000 francs. The ‘king,’ 32 inches\r\nhigh and 3 feet in circumference, weighs 255 pounds; the 'grandfather,’\r\nthough of inferior height, makes up for this deficiency by a superior\r\ngirth, and weighs 276 pounds. Many other fine crystals were sold to\r\nvarious museums and private collections for six or seven francs per\r\npound, so that Sulzer’s discovery will long be gratefully remembered in\r\nthe annals of the poor village of Guttannen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 INDEX.\r\n\r\n\r\n Aben Aboo, last Morisco chief of Granada, his end, 174\r\n Abraham, his purchase of the field of Machpelah with silver money, 297\r\n Abydos, rock-hewn cemeteries of, 205\r\n Abyssinia, rock-churches of, 186\r\n Aconcagua, height of the volcano of, 54\r\n Adelsberg, cave of, vast dimensions of the, 135, 138\r\n   entrance to the Cave of, 137\r\n   stalagmital formations of, 140\r\n   traversed by a river, 150\r\n   fungi in the, 157\r\n   subterranean animals found in the, 162, 163\r\n   insects in the, 163\r\n Adit levels, drainage by, 269\r\n Adullam, David’s refuge in the cave of, 169\r\n Æolian caverns, 198-200\r\n   those of Terni, 198\r\n   fables respecting, 199\r\n Africa, future services of Artesian wells to, 51\r\n   cannibal caves of South, 234\r\n Agates, 496\r\n   of Oberstein, 496, 498\r\n Aidepsos, antiquity of the hot baths of, 44\r\n Ajunta, rock-temples of, 182, 183\r\n Alabaster, origin of, 4\r\n   of Montmartre, 468\r\n   of Volterra, 468\r\n   of England, 469\r\n Alaghez, sulphur of the crater of the volcano of, 445\r\n Albania, subterranean water-courses of, 150\r\n Albano, Lake of, the crateriform hollow forming the, 132\r\n Albert the Great, his discovery of arsenic, 385\r\n Alchemists, their search for gold, 371\r\n Aleschga, fire temple of, 91\r\n Aleutian Mountains, volcanoes of the, 61\r\n Aleutian Archipelago, formation of a new volcanic island in the, 60\r\n Alexander the Great, wealth of, 286, 298\r\n Aldborough, amber found on the coast at, 450\r\n Algeria, Artesian wells of, 51\r\n Algiers, great part of, destroyed by the earthquake of 1755, 118\r\n Aljaska, volcanoes of the peninsula of, 61\r\n Almaden del Azogue, quicksilver mines of, 371-373\r\n   mines of New Almaden in California, 378\r\n Alpujarras, destruction of the Moors of Granada in the caves of, 173,\r\n    174\r\n Alston, situation of the town of, 366\r\n Alston Moor, horses used in the mines of, 262\r\n   great drain of Nent Force Level, 270\r\n   lead mines of, 365, 366\r\n Altaï, copper mines of the, 326\r\n   porphyry of the, 468\r\n Alten Fjord, copper mines of, 324\r\n Aluminium, discovery and uses of, 387\r\n Aluminium-bronze, 387\r\n Amber, modes of collecting, on the Prussian coast, 449\r\n   diggings near Dantzig, 449, 450\r\n   various places in which it is found, 450\r\n   what is amber?

With several hundred Wood Engravings;\r\n  and an entirely New Series of Illustrations in Chromoxylography,\r\n  representing the most Interesting Objects described in the Work, from\r\n  Original Drawings by Henry Noel Humphreys. Third English Copyright\r\n  Edition. 8vo. price 21_s._\r\n\r\n                        -----------------------\r\n\r\n‘Dr. HARTWIG’S volume is a perfect model of the popular treatment of a\r\nlarge subject. It is at once full, clear, concise, and attractive; and\r\nit possesses the merit, absolutely unique as far as our experience goes\r\nin works of this kind, of being readable from end to end. Though closely\r\npacked with details—sufficiently so indeed to be a good, though of\r\ncourse not an exhaustive, book of reference for practical use—these are\r\nso well selected and arranged, so concisely related, and so carefully\r\nsubordinated to general views, that they never produce any sensation of\r\nweariness, monotony, or confusion. There are some admirable\r\nchromoxylographs, and an infinitude of excellent woodcuts scattered up\r\nand down the pages with a profuse hand. In short, _the Sea_ has received\r\nfrom Dr. HARTWIG a recommendation to public attention which can scarcely\r\nperhaps increase its popularity, but which will certainly enable many of\r\nits admirers to regard it with a more enlarged and intelligent\r\nadmiration. The title, large as it is, does the work some injustice, for\r\nwe are apt to forget the _Sea_ itself in the _Living Wonders_ which it\r\nnourishes; and we scarcely include, in our conception of life, the\r\nvegetation of the ocean. This, however, is no fault of Dr. HARTWIG’S;\r\nfor he fairly exhausts his subject. The first seventy pages are devoted\r\nto a very clear account of the general features of the sea. Its extent\r\nand depth and colour, its coast-line and currents, the height and\r\nvelocity of its waves, the theory of its tides, the mighty circulation\r\nwhereby the life-currents of the earth rise in evaporation from the\r\nocean surface, are dispersed through the upper regions of the air, are\r\ncondensed in rain, and, trickling through the soil, return in rivers to\r\ntheir native reservoir, are all set forth with great skill and beauty of\r\nlanguage. Dr. HARTWIG then passes on to the inhabitants of the sea.\r\nFirst come the “hugest of living things,” the _Cetaceans_, with their\r\nkindred the seals and walruses—animals which in their anatomy and habits\r\nform a curious link between the tribes of earth and water, and in their\r\nvast size and outlandish forms seem, at least in fancy, to connect the\r\npresent age with distant geological periods.... Penguins and auks and\r\nalbatrosses next come under our notice: then turtles, the only modern\r\nrepresentatives of the ancient saurians; then follows a description of\r\nmany of the more curious fishes—among which we notice some singular\r\ncreatures with fins and tails and gills, which can not only live for\r\ndays out of water, but actually creep up trees and catch insects. Crabs\r\nand barnacles, worms and molluscs, star-fishes, sea-urchins, coral-\r\npolyps, and our familiar friends the sea-anemones, all come in for their\r\nfair share of attention. Even the microscopic foraminifera and\r\ndiatomaceæ are included: one chapter is given to marine plants, and\r\nanother to the primitive ocean; while the whole is appropriately closed\r\nwith a brief sketch of the progress of maritime discovery. And all this\r\nis packed into an elegant volume of 400 pages. Never, surely, was such a\r\nmine of information presented in so pleasing a shape. Dr. HARTWIG has\r\nskimmed the very cream of marine science, and thrown all its daintiest\r\nmorsels into a single attractive dish.’\r\n\r\n                                                 GUARDIAN, First Notice.\r\n\r\n‘This is the third edition, considerably enlarged, of the first and best\r\nof Dr. HARTWIG’S beautiful and popular volumes on natural history. The\r\nsize of the book is increased by a hundred pages; a good deal of it is\r\nremoulded; two whole new chapters have been added, one on Marine Caves,\r\nthe other on Marine Constructions, such as Lighthouses and Breakwaters;\r\nsome of the old illustrations have disappeared, but their place has been\r\nsupplied by more and better; so that the new edition really amounts to a\r\nrecasting of the entire book. It was a very good book before; it is\r\nbetter and more complete now. Whether we regard the letterpress or the\r\nnumerous illustrations, it takes a rank second to none among ornamental\r\nand popular books of science.’ GUARDIAN, Second Notice.\r\n\r\nTHE TROPICAL WORLD: a Popular Scientific Account of the Natural History\r\n  of the Animal and Vegetable Kingdoms and the Equatorial Regions.

All\r\nthat intelligent women and children desire to know about the tropics\r\nwill be found here—the aspects of nature, the rivers and coasts, the\r\ngreat sandy deserts, the gigantic vegetation, and the animal denizens\r\nfrom insects to apes; but excluding the tropical varieties of man.’\r\n\r\n                                            MEDICAL TIMES _and_ GAZETTE.\r\n\r\n‘Dr. HARTWIG has followed up his admirable book on the SEA by another,\r\nnot less admirable, on the _Tropical World_. The same wide erudition,\r\nvivid powers of description, and happy intermixture of popular and\r\nscientific treatment are displayed in it; and its pages are adorned by\r\nthe same profusion of elegant illustration. Within the tropics Nature\r\nrevels in her wildest luxuriance: bird, beast, reptile, and plant take\r\nthere strange forms and colours, or attain unusual magnitude. Dr.\r\nHARTWIG has steeped his pen in the glowing atmosphere of the tropics;\r\nand with it, as with a wand, he leads us through successive regions of a\r\nsunny fairyland teeming with beautiful natural objects in inexhaustible\r\nvariety, changeful and brilliant as the effulgent landscapes amid which\r\nthey flourish.’\r\n\r\n                                                               GUARDIAN.\r\n\r\n‘The tropics give us something like a picture of the antediluvian world.\r\nThe heat and moisture, with the consequent luxuriance of vegetation in\r\ntangled overgrowth, the violence of the storms, and the ferocity and\r\nhideousness of many animal forms, mark out these equatorial regions as\r\nvery striking, very picturesque, very interesting, but not very\r\nagreeable as a residence. Unless we are young, robust, and adventurous,\r\nit is pleasanter to read of such regions in our milder Europe, and to\r\nvisit them in imagination, following the adventures of others. And this\r\njourney Dr. HARTWIG enables us to make through his excellent\r\ncompilation.... We have indicated the nature of Dr. HARTWIG’S book, and\r\nhave only to add that it is compiled with great skill, and written in a\r\nclear and agreeable style. It is seldom that we have occasion to notice\r\na more satisfactory work of the class to which it belongs.’\r\n\r\n                                                        SATURDAY REVIEW.\r\n\r\n‘We ought not to conclude these gleanings without a brief notice of Dr.\r\nHARTWIG’S popular book. There are those who look with contempt on\r\npopular science of all kinds, and regard with undisguised aversion such\r\ncompilations as the one before us. We do not share these feelings in the\r\nleast degree; on the contrary, we welcome most heartily such\r\nintroductions to the study of natural history. True, they may be\r\nsometimes of little scientific value, but they are very useful stepping-\r\nstones to something more solid. They are more especially intended for\r\nthe young, but those of mature years may derive much profit by a perusal\r\nof many of these works, and even the naturalist may read them with\r\npleasure and instruction. The numerous beautifully illustrated and\r\ncarefully compiled works on natural history, such as the _Tropical\r\nWorld_, together with the _Sea and its Living Wonders_, by the same\r\nwriter, and several others which have appeared within the last few\r\nyears, are an encouraging sign of the growing interest which the rising\r\ngeneration takes in the study of the great Creator’s works, and we\r\nheartily wish them Godspeed.’\r\n\r\n                                                       QUARTERLY REVIEW.\r\n\r\n                      _Works by the same Author._\r\n\r\n                        THE HARMONIES OF NATURE,\r\n\r\n                       OR THE UNITY OF CREATION.\r\n\r\n     With 8 full-page Engravings on Wood, from Original Designs by\r\n            F.

Such a work enlarges and clears our conception of the\r\nuniverse, and we can heartily commend both the ability with which the\r\nfacts are elucidated and the reverential spirit with which they are\r\ntreated.’\r\n\r\n                                                                  GLOBE.\r\n\r\n‘Dr. HARTWIG’S book at first looks like a system of natural history: it\r\nswarms with woodcuts of zoology and comparative anatomy. But it properly\r\nbelongs to general psychology; for its object is comparison and\r\ndeduction, and a view of the chain of being, which ... after some\r\ngeneral cosmogony, begins at the lowest phases of vegetable life and\r\nends with man.... The book is very interesting, and fills a very useful\r\nplace.’\r\n\r\n                                                               ATHENÆUM.\r\n\r\n‘The nature of Dr. HARTWIG’S _Harmonies of Nature_ will perhaps be\r\nbetter understood if we call it a popularised KOSMOS. Beginning with the\r\nstarry heavens, the Author leads us through air and ocean, and shows in\r\nbroad outline how material nature is adapted to the organic life which\r\nfills it. He then traces out the ascending grades of organic life itself\r\nfrom plants to sponges and jelly-fishes, and from them up through\r\nmolluscs, insects, fishes, birds, and mammals, to man himself, the crown\r\nof all. This great outline is filled up with sufficient detail to give\r\nit substance and interest. It is traced with a flowing and expressive\r\npen, and illustrated by an elegant and abundant pencil. Those who have\r\nseen Dr. HARTWIG’S former works will be satisfied to know that this is\r\nno unworthy companion to them.’\r\n\r\n                                                               GUARDIAN.\r\n\r\n‘The _Harmonies of Nature_ will add to its Author’s well-deserved\r\nreputation as the most correct and philosophic as well as the most\r\nentertaining writer of the day on popular natural history. Unlike most\r\nof the compilers of this class of works, Dr. HARTWIG has a very\r\nextensive knowledge of his subject, a knowledge sufficient to enable him\r\nto present to his readers a well-arranged work, that may be read with\r\nprofit as well as with pleasure. The object of the work is to point out\r\nand illustrate the unity of plan which prevails throughout creation....\r\nCompared with the popular natural histories current in France and\r\nEngland, the works of Dr. HARTWIG are of much higher excellence; and for\r\nthose readers who desire to know something about physical science\r\nwithout becoming painful and diligent students, no volume can be\r\nrecommended as more delightful than the _Harmonies of Nature_.’\r\n\r\n                                                            _The_ FIELD.\r\n\r\n           --------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n                            THE POLAR WORLD;\r\n\r\n         A POPULAR DESCRIPTION OF MAN AND NATURE IN THE ARCTIC\r\n                  AND ANTARCTIC REGIONS OF THE GLOBE.\r\n\r\n       With 8 Chromoxylographic Plates, 3 Maps, and 85 Woodcuts.\r\n\r\n                           8vo. price 21_s._\r\n\r\n‘The appearance of Dr. HARTWIG’S book at this time is very opportune.\r\nThere is every reason to believe that public attention will be directed\r\nduring the next ten or fifteen years to the Polar regions and the\r\ncontemplated expeditions to them. Whether or not the suggestions are\r\ncarried out which were made at the recent meeting of the Geographical\r\nSociety for an educating trial trip to the Arctic coast, there can be no\r\ndoubt that there will be an expedition in 1881-1882 for the purpose of\r\nobserving the transit of VENUS in the Antarctic Seas. Sabrina Land and\r\nPossession Island are spoken of as suitable stations for the\r\nobservations. Most readers would have to refer to their maps, or to\r\nalmost forgotten books of Antarctic travel to make themselves acquainted\r\nwith those localities. Dr. HARTWIG’S volume gives maps, description, and\r\nhistory of all that is known concerning these icy regions in a few\r\ncompendious pages.... Like Dr. HARTWIG’S former works, the _Polar World_\r\nis a model of interesting and authentic compilation. Starting from\r\nIceland, he takes us round the lands which circle about the North Pole,\r\ndescribing their natural features, the people who inhabit them, the\r\nbirds, beasts, and fishes, and the scanty vegetation, which is\r\nfrequently little more than varieties of mosses and lichens. The same\r\nplan is followed in the regions of the South Pole. In his treatment of\r\nall these subjects the Author combines the qualities of a clever\r\nhistorian, a well-informed geographer, and a correct naturalist.\r\nGathering up all the information supplied by numerous explorers, he has\r\npresented to us the result in a beautifully illustrated volume,\r\ncontaining a clear, concise, and faithful description of man and nature\r\nin high latitudes. The work will be exceedingly useful as well as\r\ninteresting to the naturalist, as nearly every chapter in it contains\r\ncareful accounts of the animals peculiar to the regions described....\r\nThe _Polar World_ will add greatly to the already well-deserved\r\nreputation of the Author.’\r\n\r\n                                                       LAND _and_ WATER.\r\n\r\n               London: LONGMANS and CO.
