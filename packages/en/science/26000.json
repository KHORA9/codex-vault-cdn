Had he survived but a few months more, a preface in his own terse\r\nand peculiar style, containing his last ideas, would have rendered these\r\nremarks unnecessary; but he was cut off on the 8th of September, 1865,\r\nleaving this favourite manuscript to the affectionate care of his family\r\nand friends. By them it has been most carefully revised; and is now\r\npresented to the public, especially to his honoured profession, for the\r\nbenefit of which he thought and worked during the long period which\r\nelapsed between his leaving the quarter-deck and his death; as his\r\nCharts (constructed from his numerous surveys), his twenty years' Essays\r\nin the _United Service Journal_, his efforts to render his astronomical\r\nresearches accessible to seamen,--all testify.\r\n\r\nAdmiral Smyth was what has been called a _commonplacer_. He had the\r\nhabit of methodically storing up, through a long series of years, all\r\nthat could profit the seaman, whether scientific or practical. A\r\ncollector of coins, and in various ways an antiquary, he knew well, not\r\nmerely that \"many mickles make a muckle,\" but that it will sometimes\r\nchance that the turning up of one little thing makes another little\r\nthing into a great one. And he culled from the intelligent friends with\r\nwhom he associated many points of critical definition which cannot be\r\nfound elsewhere. Thus, in addition to naval terms, he has introduced\r\nothers relating to fortification; to ancient and modern arms and armour;\r\nto objects of natural history occurring at sea, in travel, &c.: the\r\nwhole forming such an assemblage of interesting and instructive matter\r\nas will prove valuable to both seaman and landsman.\r\n\r\nThis \"Digest\" may engage the attention of the naval officer, not merely\r\nfor the information it conveys, but for the doubts it may raise in\r\nmatters deserving further research. Independently of the variety of\r\nsubjects treated, the author's characteristic manner of handling them\r\nwill make it to his former brother officers a reminiscence of one of the\r\ntrue tars of the old school--the rising generation will find here old\r\nterms (often misunderstood by younger writers) interpreted by one who\r\nwas never content with a definition until he had confirmed it\r\nsatisfactorily by the aid of the most accomplished of his cotemporaries;\r\nthe landsman will discover the meaning or derivation of words either\r\nobsolete or which are not elsewhere to be traced, though occurring in\r\ngeneral literature. To all it is the legacy of an officer highly\r\nappreciated by men of science, who on shore as well as afloat fought his\r\nway to eminence in every department, and always deemed it his pride that\r\nno aim was dearer to him than the advancement of his noble profession.\r\n\r\nLONDON, _May, 1867_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CAPT^N W. H. SMYTH, R.N., K.S.F., F.R.S., F.S.A.,\r\nF.R.A.S., 1842]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat's in a word? is a question which it is held clever to quote and\r\nwise to think unanswerable: and yet there is a very good answer, and it\r\nis--a meaning, if you know it. But there is another question, and it is,\r\nWhat's a word in? There is never a poor fellow in this world but must\r\nask it now and then with a blank face, when aground for want of a\r\nmeaning. And the answer is--a dictionary, if you have it. Unfortunately,\r\nthere may be a dictionary, and one may have it, and yet the word may not\r\nbe there. It may be an old dictionary, and the word a new one; or a new\r\ndictionary, and the word an old one; a grave dictionary, and the word a\r\nslang one; a slang dictionary, and the word a grave one; and so on\r\nthrough a double line of battle of antitheses. Such is assuredly matter\r\nfor serious cogitation: and voluntarily to encounter those anomalous\r\nperplexities requires no small amount of endurance, for the task is\r\nequally crabbed and onerous, without a ray of hope to the pioneer beyond\r\nthat of making himself humbly useful. This brings me to my story.\r\n\r\nMany years ago, I harboured thoughts of compiling a kind of detailed\r\nnautical _vade mecum_; but a lot of other irons already in the fire\r\nmarred the project. Still the scheme was backing and filling, when the\r\nlate Major Shadwell Clerke--opening the year 1836 in the _United\r\nService Journal_--fired off the following, to me, unexpected\r\nannouncement:--\r\n\r\n\"A Nautical Dictionary, or Cyclopaedia of Naval Science and Nomenclature,\r\nis still a desideratum. That of Falconer is imperfect and out of date.\r\nWe have heard that the design of such a work has been entertained, and\r\nmaterials for its execution collected, by Captain W. H. Smyth, whom, we\r\nearnestly recommend to prosecute an undertaking of such promise to the\r\nservice of which he is so experienced and distinguished a member--it\r\ncould not be in more competent hands.\"\r\n\r\nThis broad hint must have been signalled by the gallant Major in the way\r\nof a stimulating fillip, and accordingly it aroused considerable\r\nattention. Among those who were excited by the notification was my\r\nfriend Captain Basil Hall, who wrote to me from Paris a few days\r\nafterwards--13th of January, 1836--in these words:\r\n\r\n\"I read a day or two ago, in the _United Service Journal_, that you had\r\nsome thoughts of preparing a Nautical Dictionary for publication; and\r\nfrom your connection with that journal, or at least your acquaintance\r\nwith our friend the editor, I am led to fear that the report may be\r\ntrue. You will understand the use of the word _fear_ when I tell you\r\nthat, for nearly three years, _my_ own thoughts have turned in the same\r\ndirection, and I have been busily preparing for a task to which I meant\r\nto buckle to with a will, and to which I meant to devote some four or\r\nfive years of exclusive diligence. What I am anxious to know, as soon as\r\nmay be, is the fact of your having undertaken a similar work, _or not_.\r\nFor I assure you I am not so foolish, nor so insensible either to my own\r\npeace of mind or my own reputation; nor am I so careless of your good\r\nopinion and regard, as to enter the lists with you. I repeat, neither my\r\nfeelings nor my judgment would permit me in any way to cross your hawse,\r\nif indeed, as I too much fear, you have got before me. There is one\r\nother man in the service besides yourself, and only one, with whom no\r\nconsideration would induce me to enter into competition--and that is\r\nBeaufort--but his hands, I presume, are full enough, and I had somehow\r\nimagined yours were too. So much so, that you were one of the first men\r\nI meant to consult on my return to England, and to beg assistance from.\r\nI should not have minded the competition of any one else, but I am not\r\nso vain as to suppose that I could do the thing as well as either of\r\nyou--and therefore, even if I were not restrained by motives of personal\r\nfriendship, I should never dream of risking my reputation for\r\nprofessional, scientific, or literary attainments by a struggle in which\r\nI should certainly be worsted.\"\r\n\r\nTo this hearty and laudatory interpellation, an immediate reply was\r\nreturned, stating that I had long held the subject in view, but that\r\nother weighty avocations occasioned its hanging fire, and had compelled\r\nme to suspend it _sine die_. Still I considered such a work necessary to\r\nthe current wants, as well those of seafarers as of the landsmen who\r\nevince a taste for nautical matters; and that, from his profession and\r\nliterary prowess, I knew of no one better fitted for the task than\r\nhimself--adding that, under the emergency, my papers were at his\r\nservice, and I would occasionally give him such personal aid as might\r\nlie in my power. This was acknowledged in a long explicatory letter, of\r\nwhich the following are extracts:--\r\n\r\n\"I trust I know the value of a compliment as well as any man, and I can\r\nsay, with perfect truth, that in the whole of my career (such as it has\r\nbeen), professional, scientific, or literary, no compliment--I may say\r\nno circumstance--has occurred which has given me so much honest\r\ngratification as your letter of the 3d. I know you are a man not to say\r\nwhat you do not truly think, nor to express yourself strongly where you\r\nhave not observed carefully. I shall therefore not disclaim your\r\ncompliment, but rather seek, in a kindred spirit, to work up to the mark\r\nwhich you assign me--and which I know but too well how far I am short\r\nof.\r\n\r\n\"I do hope, indeed, that as you say, 'we may row in the same boat\r\nwithout catching crabs;' but of this I am quite resolved, not to cross\r\nyour hawse, nor to interfere with your project, which you have alluded\r\nto as having already commenced. That is to say, I shall not interfere\r\nunless I can be of use to it and to you, and with your full concurrence,\r\nand, as I hope, your companionship. * * * *\r\n\r\n\"What I should propose would be, that you should furnish the\r\nprofessional technicalities in all the different branches, and that I\r\nshould endeavour to popularize them. Here and there--as in the matter of\r\nNavigation--I also might intrude with some few technicalities. But\r\ngenerally speaking it would be you who should provide the real solid\r\nstuff, and I who should attempt to dress it up so as to be intelligible\r\n_beyond_ the limits of the sea-service; and also to be intelligible to\r\nthose young persons whom it is very important to instruct in general and\r\neven popular views, but for whom it would be needless to write a new\r\nelementary treatise. * * * *\r\n\r\n\"This is a sketch of my plan. What think you of it? I must add one\r\nthing, however, that you must be the senior officer on the occasion. I\r\nshall act in all this matter, and in the most perfect good faith, as\r\nyour subordinate.\"\r\n\r\nIn responding to this full and frank overture, I entered into a few more\r\nparticulars respecting my progress and purpose in the projected work;\r\nand invited him--on his return from France--to come at once to Bedford\r\nand ransack my papers.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, in the autumn of 1836, Captain Basil Hall and his\r\nfamily--the whole of the Schloss Handfeldt party--arrived at my house,\r\nwhere he was located in a quiet library, with all my materials for the\r\nNaval Dictionary before him. Here he remained in close examination of\r\nthem during two days, when he promised to send me his ultimatum in\r\nwriting after due deliberation. He required time for this, seeing I had\r\nfairly warned him that my onerous undertakings would necessarily throw\r\nthe heavier share of our performance upon his shoulders. On the 27th of\r\nNovember I received a letter from Edinburgh, in which he made this\r\nstatement:--\r\n\r\n\"With respect to the Marine Dictionary I think we have come to a clear\r\nunderstanding--namely, that for the present it is standing fast. _I_\r\ncertainly had a notion that I was an interloper, and as soon as I saw\r\nthe vast deal you had done in the way of preparation, that it became me\r\nas a man of fair dealing, to back out. This does not, however, appear to\r\nhave been your wish, but on the contrary that we may still make a joint\r\nwork of it by-and-by, when we have leisure, both of us, to engage in it\r\nheartily--tooth and nail. I shall therefore keep it in my thoughts, and\r\nendeavour to shape my future plans so as to meet this view, and, should\r\nI see occasion, I can write to you about it. My present notion is, that\r\nif ever we do set about it, I must come to Bedford for a season, and\r\ngive myself entirely up to the work, under your direction. The work, to\r\nbe worth a straw, or at all what would be expected from you and me,\r\nwould require no small labour on our parts, for a considerable length of\r\ntime.\"\r\n\r\nWe consequently lay upon our oars for some time, but occasionally\r\npulling a stroke or two to keep to the station, and be ready for\r\nhead-way when required. While thus prepared, in 1842 my excellent and\r\nhighly accomplished friend was most unexpectedly assailed by an\r\nafflicting malady, which at once reduced a brilliant mind to a\r\ndistressing fatuity, which--after two lingering years--closed his\r\nvaluable life, and clued up our arrangements.\r\n\r\nMeantime our plan had oozed out, and too great an expectation was evoked\r\nin certain quarters, the inquiries from whence were frequent reminders.\r\nAt length in 1865, most of my undertakings having been completed, and\r\nout of the way, I made an overhaul of the bulky ribs and trucks of the\r\nscheme in question. Both my judgment and feelings united in showing that\r\nit is now too late in the day for me to think of setting about such a\r\nwork as was contemplated thirty years ago; yet finding myself still\r\ncapable of application, and fully knowing all the bearings of the case,\r\nI feel assured that a comprehensive and useful \"word-book\" may be made\r\nfrom the shakings. On the whole, therefore, the foregoing particulars\r\nseem to be a necessary prelude to this introduction.\r\n\r\nDoubtless a well-digested marine dictionary would be equally beneficial\r\nto the country and to the service, for the utility of such a work in\r\nassisting those who are engaged in carrying on practical sea duties is\r\nso generally admitted, that it is allowable here to dilate upon its\r\nimportance, especially when it is considered how much information a\r\nyouth has to acquire, on his first going afloat, in order to qualify him\r\nfor a position so totally different from what he had hitherto been\r\nfamiliar with. In this case such a volume might justly be deemed one of\r\nthe most useful of his companions, as it would at all times answer his\r\nquestions, and aid that ardour of inquiry which some of his shipmates\r\nmight not find it easy to satisfy. It would quicken the slow progress of\r\nexperience, and aid those who take a pleasure in the knowledge and\r\ndischarge of their duties. But a work of this description must\r\nnecessarily require constant additions, and revised explanations, to\r\nenable it to keep pace with the wondrous alterations and innovations\r\nwhich are now taking place in every department of the naval service. The\r\nfuture of all this is utterly inscrutable!\r\n\r\nNor has this province been neglected, as the efforts of Captain John\r\nSmith (of mine own clan), Maynwaring, Boteler, Blanckley, Falconer,\r\nYoung, and many others, testify; and however they may fall short of what\r\nnaval science demands, they are full of initiative training. Indeed they\r\nmay all be advantageously consulted, for honey is not the less sweet\r\nbecause it is gathered from many flowers; and I have freely availed\r\nmyself of their various works, as far as they go, though I have adopted\r\nno term without holding myself responsible for its actuality. Such a\r\nvaunt may be considered to savour of the _parturiunt montes_ apothegm,\r\nbut the reader may confidently rest assured that whatever shortcomings\r\nhe may detect they are not the result of negligence.\r\n\r\nIt has been pronounced that such lexicography may be too diffuse; that\r\nto describe the track of every particular rope through its different\r\nchannels, however requisite for seamen, would be useless and\r\nunintelligible to a landsman. But surely nothing can be considered\r\nuseless which tends directly to information, nor can that be\r\nunintelligible which is clearly defined. Moreover, such a work may be so\r\ncarried out as not only to be instructive in professional minutiae, but\r\nalso to be a vehicle for making us acquainted with the rules which\r\nguided the seamen of former times, thereby affording an insight into\r\nthose which are likely to direct them in their own.\r\n\r\nFrom the causes already stated, my project of a full sailor's dictionary\r\nfell to the ground; yet in course of time, and at the age of\r\nseventy-seven, finding leisure at last on hand, I thought it feasible to\r\nwork my materials into a sort of maritime glossary. The objects of such\r\na digest are to afford a ready reference to young or old, professional\r\nor non-professional, persons, who by consulting it may obtain an instant\r\nanswer to a given question. Now although many of the explanations may be\r\nsuperfluous to some seamen, still they may lead others to a right\r\nunderstanding of various brackish expressions and phrases, without\r\nhaving to put crude queries, many of which those inquired of might be\r\nunable to solve. Nor is it only those afloat who are to be thus\r\nconsidered; all the empire is more or less connected with its navy and\r\nits commerce, and nautical phraseology is thereby daily becoming more\r\nhabitual with all classes of the lieges than of erst. Even our\r\nparliamentary orators, with a proper national bias, talk of swamping a\r\nmeasure, danger ahead, taking the wind out of an antagonist's sails,\r\ndrifting into war, steering a bill through the shoals of opposition or\r\nthrowing it overboard, following in the wake of a leader, trimming to\r\nthe breeze, tiding a question over the session, opinions above or below\r\nthe gangway, and the like, so rife of late in St. Stephen's; even when a\r\nmember \"rats\" on seeing that the pumps cannot keep his party from\r\nfalling to leeward, he is but imitating the vermin that quit a\r\nsinking-ship.\r\n\r\nThis predilection for sea idiom is assuredly proper in a maritime\r\npeople, especially as many of the phrases are at once graphic, terse,\r\nand perspicuous. How could the whereabouts of an aching tooth be better\r\npointed out to an operative dentist than Jack's \"'Tis the aftermost\r\ngrinder aloft, on the starboard quarter.\" The ship expressions preserve\r\nmany British and Anglo-Saxon words, with their quaint old preterites and\r\ntelling colloquialisms; and such may require explanation, as well for\r\nthe youthful aspirant as for the cocoa-nut-headed prelector in nautic\r\nlore. It is indeed remarkable how largely that foundation of the English\r\nlanguage has been preserved by means of our sailors.\r\n\r\nThis phraseology has necessarily been added to from time to time, and\r\nconsequently bears the stamp of our successive ages of sea-life. In the\r\n\"ancient and fishlike\" terms that brave Raleigh derived from his\r\npredecessors, many epithets must have resulted from ardent recollections\r\nof home and those at home, for in a ship we find--\r\n\r\n Apeak,       Cat's-paw,    Driver,      Hound,       Rabbit,      Stays,\r\n Apron,       Cot,          Earings,     Jewel,       Ribband,     Stirrup,\r\n A-stay,      Cradle,       Eyes,        Lacings,     Saddle,      Tiller,\r\n Bonnet,      Crib,         Fox,         Martingale,  Sheaves,     Truck,\r\n Braces,      Crow-foot,    Garnet,      Mouse,       Sheets,      Truss,\r\n Bridle,      Crow's nest,  Goose-neck,  Nettle,      Sheepshank,  Watch,\r\n Cap,         Crown,        Goose-wing,  Pins,        Shoe,        Whip,\r\n Catharpins,  Diamond,      Horse,       Puddings,    Sister,      Yard.\r\n Cat-heads,   Dog,          Hose,\r\n\r\nMost of the real sea-terms are pregnant with meaning; but those who\r\nundertake to expound them ought to be tolerably versed in the topic.\r\nThus perhaps there was no great harm in Dr. Johnson's being utterly\r\nignorant of maritime language, but it was temerariously vain in that\r\nsturdy lexicographer to assert that _belay_ is a sea-phrase for splicing\r\na rope; _main sheet_, for the largest sail in a ship; and _bight_, for\r\nthe circumference of a coil of rope; and we long had him on the hip\r\nrespecting the _purser_, a personage whom he--misled by Burser--at once\r\npronounced to be the paymaster of a ship; as the then purser was, in\r\nfact, more familiar with slops, tobacco, pork, dips, biscuit, and the\r\nlike, than with cash payments--for, excepting short-allowance dues, he\r\nhad very little meddling with money matters. But the Admiralty have\r\nrecently swamped the well-known and distinctive nautical title--despite\r\nof its time-honoured claims to repute--and introduced the army\r\nappellative, PAYMASTER, in its stead.\r\n\r\nThe pithy conciseness of the brackish tongue renders it eminently useful\r\non duty. In some of their sea-phrases the French, our great rivals, use\r\na heap of words more than we are wont to do. An instance is\r\ngiven--supposing a ship of the former met with one of ours, and they\r\nshould desire to salute each other, the English commander would sing\r\nout, \"Man ship!\" but the French captain would have to exclaim, \"Rangez\r\ndu monde sur les vergues pour donner des cris de salut!\" By the way,\r\nthere is a _ben trovato_ respecting the difficulty of doing our naval\r\ntidings into French: a translator of note made quite a mull of a ship\r\nbeing _brought up_ by her anchors, and of another which was stranded\r\nfrom _borrowing_ too much; while \"a man-of-war riding easily in the road\r\nat Spithead\" was rendered \"Un homme de guerre se promenait a cheval a\r\nson aise sur le chemin de Spithead.\" Some of the French terms, however,\r\nare recommended by their Parisian stamp, as in calling iron bilboes \"bas\r\nde soie\"--the waist-netting \"Saint Aubinet\"--the quarter-gallery a\r\n\"jardin d'amour:\" but similar elegance was not manifested in dubbing the\r\nopen-hearted thorough-bred tar \"un loup de mer.\"\r\n\r\nIn the work before us, the nautical import of the terms is duly\r\nconsidered, and the orthography, as far as feasible, is ruled by\r\nauthority and custom, with an occasional slight glance at the probable\r\netymology of the words--slight, because derivation is a seductive and\r\nfrequently illusory pilot. Our language is said to have been arraigned\r\nby foreigners for its hissing enunciation; but, regardless of the\r\nrebuke, our pundits have, of late, unnecessarily increased the whistling\r\nby substituting the sibilant _s_ for the vocal _z_, in all sorts of\r\ncases. Happily this same _s_ not being yet acclimatized to the galley,\r\nJack will continue to give tongue to an enterpri_z_ing crui_z_e after\r\nPortugue_z_e merchandi_z_e, and there anent.\r\n\r\nThe plan of our work may be said to comprise the treating _de omnibus\r\nrebus nauticis_, for many branches of knowledge are demanded of the\r\nintelligent seaman. Thus in Naval Architecture, the terms used in the\r\nconstruction of ships, the plans and sections, and the mechanical means\r\nof the builders, are undoubted requirements of a sea word-book. So also\r\nin Astronomy, or that portion of nautical science constituting\r\nobservations which are necessary to the determinations of the navigator.\r\nIn Mathematics, especially the branch distinguished as practical, the\r\ndoctrine which teaches whatever is capable of being numbered or\r\nmeasured, requires verbal elucidation, not so much for the educated\r\nyouth, as for him who labours under difficulties--who is\r\n\r\n    \"In canvass'd berth, profoundly deep in thought,\r\n    His busy mind with sines and tangents fraught.\"\r\n\r\nMany of the words in our columns are not _de facto_ sea-terms, but as\r\nthey are in rife and familiar use on ship-board, they obtained a\r\nlodgment; whence it becomes rather a difficult matter to mark a\r\nboundary for nautic language. Various expressions are also retained\r\nwhich, though unused or all but obsolete, occur so frequently in\r\nprofessional treatises and antiquated journals, that their exposition\r\nmay often be welcomed by a general reader: they are here introduced, not\r\nas worthy of revival, yet as necessary to be understood when fallen in\r\nwith. And it should be remembered, that--especially during our last\r\nconflict with France--so many combined enterprises occurred, that the\r\nmost general naval and military phrases pertained, in a manner, to both\r\narms of the service.\r\n\r\nWhat may be termed mere galley-slang also demands explanation, since\r\neven officers are sometimes ashore--I was going to say at\r\nsea--respecting its purport; and I recollect at a court-martial holden\r\non a seaman for insolence to his superior, the lingo used by the shrewd\r\nculprit was liable to be thought respectful or otherwise according to\r\nthe manner of utterance, and he was admitted to the benefit of the\r\ndoubtful meaning. Still it must be admitted that all vulgarisms, as far\r\nas practicable, should be indignantly spurned from our noble English\r\nlanguage--a language unequalled for excellence in fluency, capacity, and\r\nstrength. A stern critic may also, and in truth, aver that terms are\r\nincluded on our roll the which are not altogether of maritime usage.\r\nThis we have admitted, but the allegation will be greatly weakened on\r\nscrutiny, for they are here given in the sense entertained of them in\r\nnautic parlance. Such are generally illustrative of some of the lingual\r\nor local peculiarities of sea-life, or borne on its literature, and\r\ntherefore are necessarily admitted as having a footing in maritime\r\nphilology. Some of our misused words and archaic phrases are, by\r\ninfluence of the newspaper magnates, brought across the Atlantic, and\r\nre-appear among us under the style and title of Americanisms: after\r\nwhich fashion, in the lapse of time and the mutation of dialect,\r\nvocables once differing in origin and meaning may become identical in\r\nsense and sound.[A]\r\n\r\n[A] As for example the word _alarm_, _alarum_, a bell, from the German\r\n_laerm_; but the military _alarm_ on a drum is the Italian _all'arme_.\r\n\r\nFinally, Natural History, a taste for which is a substantial blessing to\r\nthe sailor, is too vast a department for our professional pages.\r\nHowever, a few requisite definitions of the familiar products of the\r\nair, earth, and water are introduced. Numbers of marine birds and many\r\nfishes--so often misnamed--are entered upon the muster; and especially\r\nthose which the blue-jackets vote to be very good eating; yet, as a\r\nreverend author has well observed, we should, in such cases, recur to\r\nthe probable state of their appetites at the time of experiment. The\r\nmost general nautic dishes and refections are likewise cited, to the\r\nmaking of which most of our sea-cooks are competent--there being no\r\npuree, entremet, or fricandeau to trouble them. But though they are at\r\ntimes libelled as being sent from the infernal regions, they are pretty\r\nfair in their way; and though no great shakes in domestic chemistry,\r\nthey can enter the lists against any white-aproned _artiste_ at\r\npea-soup, beef-steak, lobscouse, pillau, curried shark, twice-laid, or\r\nsavoury sea-pie. Still, a more luxurious tendency in this department is\r\ncasting its shadow before; and there are Sybarites invading the ocean to\r\nwhom the taste of junk is all but unknown.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Signature of W. H. Smyth]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA DIGEST\r\n\r\nOF\r\n\r\nSEA TERMS AND PHRASES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. The highest class of the excellence of merchant ships on Lloyd's\r\nbooks, subdivided into A 1 and A 2, after which they descend by the\r\nvowels: A 1 being the very best of the first class. Formerly a\r\nriver-built (Thames) ship took the first rate for 12 years, a Bristol\r\none for 11, and those of the northern ports 10. Some of the out-port\r\nbuilt ships keep their rating 6 to 8 years, and inferior ones only 4.\r\nBut improvements in ship-building, and the large introduction of iron,\r\nare now claiming longer life.\r\n\r\nA is an Anglo-Saxonism for _in_ or _on_; as _a_'board, _a_'going, &c.\r\n\r\nA.B. The rating of _Able Seamen_ on the ship's books: these two letters\r\nare often used as an epithet for the person so rated. He must be equal\r\nto all the duties required of a seaman in a ship--not only as regards\r\nthe saying to \"hand, reef, and steer,\" but also to strop a block,\r\nsplice, knot, turn in rigging, raise a mouse on the main-stay, and be an\r\nexample to the _ordinary seamen_ and _landsmen_.\r\n\r\nABAB. A Turkish sailor who plies in coasting craft.\r\n\r\nABACK. The situation of a ship's sails when the wind bears against their\r\nfront surfaces. They are _laid aback_, when this is purposely effected\r\nto deaden her way by rounding in the weather-braces; and _taken aback_,\r\nwhen brought to by an unexpected change of wind, or by inattention in\r\nthe helmsman.--_All aback forward_, the notice given from the\r\nforecastle, when the head-sails are pressed aback by a sudden change in\r\nthe wind. (_See_ WORK ABACK.)--_Taken aback_, a colloquialism for being\r\nsuddenly surprised or found out.\r\n\r\nABACUS.

It is the relative situation of an object with the ship,\r\nwhen that object is placed in the arc of the horizon contained between a\r\nline at right angles with the keel and the point of the compass which is\r\ndirectly opposite the ship's course. An object--as a man overboard--is\r\ndescribed by the look-out man at the mast-head as abeam, before, or\r\nabaft the beam, by so many points of the compass. As a vessel seen may\r\nbe \"three points before the beam,\" &c.\r\n\r\nABAKA. A fine vegetable fibre, with which the white Manila rope, so much\r\nused on the India station, is made. This rope floats in water, and is\r\nnot subject to rot, nor does it require tarring.

Deserting and abandoning her by reason of\r\nunseaworthiness or danger of remaining in her, also when grounded and\r\ncannot be saved. This never occurs but in imminent cases; therefore,\r\nbefore the insured can demand recompense from the underwriter, they must\r\ncede or _abandon_ to him the right of all property which may be\r\nrecovered from shipwreck, capture, or any other peril stated in the\r\npolicy. Other parties entering and bringing the vessel into port obtain\r\nsalvage. (_Vide_ DERELICT.)\r\n\r\nABASE, TO. An old word signifying to lower a flag or sail. _Abaisser_ is\r\nin use in the French marine, and both may be derived from the still\r\nolder _abeigh_. _Abase_ literally means to cast down, to humble.\r\n\r\nABATE, TO. An old Anglo-Norman word from _abattre_, to beat down or\r\ndestroy; as, to _abate_ a castle or fort, is to beat it down; and a gale\r\nis said to _abate_ when it decreases.

(_See_ BRACE ABACK.)--_Lay the head-yards\r\nabox_--in former times, and even at present, many good seamen prefer to\r\nlay the head-yards square, or abox, to heave-to. It brings the vessel\r\nmore under command for sudden evolution, wearing, or staying.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM-MEN. A cant term for vagabonds, who formerly begged about under\r\npretence of having been discharged destitute from ships and hospitals;\r\nwhence an idle malingerer wanting to enter the doctor's list is said to\r\n\"sham Abraham.\" From a ward in Bedlam which was appropriated for the\r\nreception of idiots, which was named Abraham: it is a very old term, and\r\nwas cited by Burton in the _Anatomy of Melancholy_ so far back as 1621.\r\n\r\nABRASE, TO.

An old word for purveyor of victuals, whence _caterer_, or\r\nsuperintendent and provider of a mess. Thus in Ben Jonson's \"The Devil\r\nis an Ass\"--\r\n\r\n    \"He is my wardrobe-man, my _acater_,\r\n    Cook, butler, and steward.\"\r\n\r\nACATES. Victuals; provisions purchased; delicious food; dainties.\r\n\r\nACATIUM. A word used in Roman naval affairs for a small boat, and also\r\nthe main-mast of a ship.\r\n\r\nACCELERATION. The increase of velocity in a moving body by the force of\r\ngravity. A planet is said to be accelerated when its actual diurnal\r\nmotion exceeds its mean. In fixed stars the acceleration is the mean\r\ntime by which they anticipate the sun's diurnal revolution, which is 3'\r\n56\" nearly.--_Acceleration of the moon_ is the increase of her mean\r\nmotion, caused by a slow change in the excentricity of the terrestrial\r\norbit, and which has sensibly diminished the length of the moon's\r\nrevolution since the time of the earliest observations.\r\n\r\nACCESS.

A ship riding across tide, with the wind in the\r\ndirection of the tide, would tend to leeward of her anchor; but with a\r\nweather tide, or that running against the wind, if the tide be strong,\r\nwould tend to windward.

When a commissioned officer is invalided, his vacancy\r\nis filled up pending the pleasure of the admiralty by an acting order.\r\nBut when an officer dies on a station, where the admiralty delegates the\r\npower to the admiral commanding in chief, the vacancy is filled by an\r\nacting commission. Thus also rear-admirals now act on acting commissions\r\nas vice-admirals during command on their station, but return to their\r\nproper position on the navy list when it ceases.\r\n\r\nACTION.

Swinging a ship to every point of bearing, to\r\nnote the variation or error of the needle upon each rhumb, due to the\r\nlocal attraction of the iron, or the mass, on each separate compass\r\nbearing.

[From Lat. _adjuvo_, to help.] A military assistant to\r\nfield-officers. The term has been applied to an assistant captain of a\r\nfleet. It is indeed the duty performed by first lieutenants.\r\n\r\nADMEASUREMENT. The calculation of proportions according to assumed\r\nrules, often ignorantly practised in estimating the tonnage of a ship.\r\n\r\nADMIRAL. The derivation of this noble title from the Greek _almyros_,\r\nfrom the Latin _admirabilis_, from the Saxon _aenmereeal_, and from the\r\nFrench _aumer_, appear all fanciful. It is extensively received that the\r\nSicilians first adopted it from _emir_, the sea, of their Saracen\r\nmasters; but it presents a kind of unusual etymological inversion. The\r\nterm is most frequent in old Romance; but the style and title was not\r\nused by us until 1286; and in 1294, William de Leybourne was designated\r\n\"Amiral de la Mer du Roy d'Angleterre;\" six years afterwards Viscount\r\nNarbonne was constituted Admiral of France; which dates nearly fix the\r\ncommencement of the two states as maritime powers.\r\n\r\nThe _admiral_ is the chief commander of a fleet, but of this rank there\r\nare three degrees, distinguished by a flag at the fore, main, or mizen\r\nmast, according to the title of _admiral_, _vice-admiral_, or\r\n_rear-admiral_. These were again subdivided according to their colour of\r\nred, white, or blue, which had to be likewise borne by the squadrons\r\nthey respectively commanded. (_See_ FLAG.) In 1865 the colours were\r\nomitted, and the only flag now hoisted by ships of war is the white St.\r\nGeorge's ensign, and for admirals the white St. George's cross at the\r\nmain, fore, or mizen.\r\n\r\nThe _admiral of the fleet_ is the highest officer under the admiralty of\r\nGreat Britain; it is rather an honorary distinction, and usually\r\nattained by seniority and service: when this officer serves afloat, he\r\nhoists the proud distinction of the Union flag at the main.\r\n\r\nThe _lord high-admiral_ was one of the principal officers of the state,\r\nwho formerly decided all cases relating to the sea: he wore a gold call\r\nand chain, similar in form to that which has descended to the boatswain\r\nand his mate. This dignity has been extinct for many years, and the duty\r\nmerged into that of the lords-commissioners and admiralty court; in\r\n1827, it was revived for a short time in the person of His Royal\r\nHighness the Duke of Clarence.\r\n\r\nThe epithet of _admiral_ was also formerly applied to any large or\r\nleading ship, without reference to flag; and is still used for the\r\nprincipal vessel in the cod and whale fisheries. That which arrives\r\nfirst in any port of Newfoundland retains this title during the season,\r\nwith certain rights of beach in flakes. The master of the second ship\r\nbecomes the vice-admiral, and the master of the third the rear-admiral.\r\n\r\nADMIRAL. A beautiful and rare shell of the genus _Conus_; the varieties\r\nare designated the grand-admiral, the vice-admiral, the orange-admiral,\r\nand the extra-admiral.\r\n\r\nADMIRALTY. An office for the administration of naval affairs, presided\r\nover by a lord high-admiral, whether the duty be discharged by one\r\nperson, or by commissioners under the royal patent, who are styled\r\nlords, and during our former wars generally consisted of seven. The\r\npresent constitution of the Board of Admiralty comprises--the first\r\nlord, a minister and civilian as to office; four naval lords; one civil\r\nlord attending to accounts, &c.; one chief secretary; one second\r\nsecretary. Two lords and one secretary form a legal Board of Admiralty\r\nwherever they may be assembled, under the authority of the board or its\r\nchief.\r\n\r\nADMIRALTY BLACK-BOOK. _See_ BLACK-BOOK.\r\n\r\nADMIRALTY COURT. The constitution of this court relatively to the\r\nlegislative power of the king in council, is analogous to that of the\r\ncourts of common law relatively to the parliament of the kingdom.--_High\r\nCourt of Admiralty_, a supreme court of law, in which the authority of\r\nthe lord high-admiral is ostensibly exercised in his _judicial_ capacity\r\nfor the trial of maritime causes of a civil nature. Although termed the\r\nHigh Court of Admiralty, more properly this is the Court of\r\nVice-Admiralty, and relates solely to civil and military matters of the\r\nsea, and sea boundaries, prizes, collisions, vessels or goods cast on\r\nthe shore where the vice-admirals have civil jurisdiction, but no naval\r\npower, as the lord-lieutenants of counties are named in their patents\r\n\"vice-admirals of the same;\" in like manner all governors of colonies.\r\nAll cases in connection are tried by the Admiralty Court in London, or\r\nby our \"courts of vice-admiralty and prize jurisdictions abroad.\"\r\nAdmirable as some of the decisions of this expensive tribunal have been,\r\nit has all the powers of the Inquisition in its practice, and has\r\nthereby been an instrument of persecution to some innocent navigators,\r\nwhile it has befriended notorious villains. Besides this we have the\r\nAdmiralty Court of Oyer and Terminer, for the trial of all murders,\r\npiracies, or criminal acts which occur within the limits of the country,\r\non the coast-lines, at sea, or wherever the admiralty jurisdiction\r\nextends--the deck of a British ship included.\r\n\r\nADMIRALTY MIDSHIPMAN. Formerly one who, having served the appointed\r\ntime, and passed his examination for lieutenant, was appointed to a ship\r\nby the admiralty, and thus named in contradistinction to those who used\r\nto be rated by the captain; he generally had precedence for promotion to\r\n\"acting orders.\"\r\n\r\nADONIS.

A cutting tool of the axe kind, for dubbing flat and\r\ncircular work, much used by shipwrights, especially by the Parsee\r\nbuilders in India, with whom it serves for axe, plane, and chisel. It is\r\na curious fact that from the polar regions to the equator, and southerly\r\nthroughout Polynesia, this instrument and its peculiar adaptations,\r\nwhether made of iron, basalt, nephrite, &c., all preserve the same idea\r\nor identity of conception.\r\n\r\nAEINAUTAE.

An official inconsistent subscription, even to\r\nletters of reproof and imprest, used by the former Board of\r\nCommissioners of the Navy to such officers as were not of noble families\r\nor bore titles; the only British board that ever made so mean a\r\ndistinction, equally kind with the regrets of the clergy on burning a\r\nheretic, or those of Walton in cutting a live fish _tenderly_. It was\r\nprobably adopted from James, Duke of York, who, when lord high-admiral,\r\nalways so subscribed his official letters. It is said that this practice\r\nwas discontinued in consequence of a distinguished naval captain--a\r\nknight--adding, \"your affectionate friend.\" He was thereupon desired to\r\n\"discontinue such an expression,\" when he replied, \"I am, gentlemen, no\r\nlonger your affectionate friend, J.

Whatever disagreeable occurrence takes place after the\r\nconsequences of the cause were thought at an end; a principal\r\napplication being when a ship, supposed to have struck, opens her fire\r\nagain. This is a very old English word, alluding to unexpected events\r\nhappening after the seeming end of an affair; thus Spenser, in \"Mother\r\nHubbard's Tale\"--\r\n\r\n    \"And bad next day that all should readie be,\r\n    But they more subtill meaning had than he:\r\n    For the next morrowes mede they closely ment,\r\n    For feare of _after-claps_, for to prevent.\"\r\n\r\nAFTER-END.

It is\r\nnow found in great abundance throughout the Polynesian Islands,\r\nMauritius, &c. It is soluble, and forms a clear jelly--used by\r\nconsumptive patients. It fetches a high price in China.

In\r\nPolar regions two such transits of the sun, and in England similarly,\r\ncircumpolar stars afford double observations for the determination of\r\ntime or latitude. The general term is understood by seamen to denote\r\nmid-day, when the passage and meridian altitude of the sun affords the\r\nlatitude.--_True altitude_ is that produced by correcting the apparent\r\none for parallax and refraction.\r\n\r\nALTMIKLEC.

Its\r\nliteral signification is, with force or vigour, all at once, suddenly;\r\nand it is generally used to anything which is moved by a tackle-fall, as\r\n\"lower amain!\" let run at once. When we used to demand the salute in\r\nthe narrow seas, the lowering of the top-sail was called _striking\r\namain_ (_see_ STRIKE), and it was demanded by the _wave amain_ (_see_\r\nWAVING), or brandishing a bright sword to and fro.\r\n\r\nAMALPHITAN CODE, the oldest code of modern sea-laws, compiled, during\r\nthe first Crusade, by the people of Amalfi in Italy, who then possessed\r\nconsiderable commerce and maritime power.\r\n\r\nAMAYE.

Obtuse angular.\r\n\r\nAMBRY. _See_ AUMBREY.\r\n\r\nAMBUSCADE [Span. _emboscada_]. A body of men lying in wait to surprise\r\nan enemy, or cut off his supplies; also the site where they lurk.

The ballium, or inclosed plot of ground in an ancient fort.\r\n\r\nBAIL. A surety. The cargo of a captured or detained vessel is not\r\nallowed to be taken on bail before adjudication without mutual consent.\r\nIt was also a northern term for a beacon or signal.\r\n\r\nBAIL-BOND. The obligation entered into by sureties. Also when a person\r\nappears as proxy for the master of a vessel, or, on obtaining letters of\r\nmarque, he makes himself personally responsible. In prize matters,\r\nhowever, the bail-bond is not a mere personal security given to the\r\nindividual captors, but an assurance to abide by the adjudication of the\r\ncourt.\r\n\r\nBAIL'D. This phrase \"I'll be bail'd\" is considered as an equivalent to\r\n\"I'll be bound;\" but it is probably an old enunciation for \"I'll be\r\npoisoned,\" or \"I'll be tormented,\" if what I utter is not true.\r\n\r\nBAILO. A Levantine term for consul.\r\n\r\nBAILS, OR BAILES. The hoops which bear up the tilt of a boat.\r\n\r\nBAIOCCO. An Italian copper coin, about equal to our halfpenny.

To contract a sail into a narrower compass;--this is\r\npeculiar to the mizen of a ship, and to the main-sail of those vessels\r\nwherein it is extended by a boom. The operation of balancing the mizen\r\nis performed by lowering the yard or gaff a little, then rolling up a\r\nsmall portion of the sail at the peak or upper corner, and lashing it\r\nabout one-fifth down towards the mast. A boom main-sail is balanced by\r\nrolling up a portion of the clew, or lower aftermost corner, and\r\nfastening it strongly to the boom.--N.B. It is requisite in both cases\r\nto wrap a piece of old canvas round the sail, under the lashing, to\r\nprevent its being fretted by the latter.\r\n\r\nBALANCE-FISH. The hammer-headed shark (which see).\r\n\r\nBALANCE-FRAMES. Those frames or bends of timber, of an equal capacity or\r\narea, which are equally distant from the ship's centre of gravity.\r\n\r\nBALANCE OF TRADE. A computation of the value of all commodities which we\r\nimport or export, showing the difference in amount.\r\n\r\nBALANCE-REEF. A reef-band that crosses a sail from the outer head-earing\r\nto the tack diagonally, making it nearly triangular, and is used to\r\ncontract it in very blowing weather. (2) A balance reef-band is\r\ngenerally placed in all gaff-sails; the band runs from the throat to the\r\nclew, so that it may be reefed either way--by lacing the foot or lower\r\nhalf; or by lacing the gaff drooped to the band: the latter is only done\r\nin the worst weather.--This is a point on which seamen may select--but\r\nthe old plan, as first given, affords more power; (2) is applicable to\r\nthe severest weather.\r\n\r\nBALANCING-POINT. A familiar term for centre of gravity. (_See_ GRAVITY.)\r\n\r\nBALANDRA. A Spanish pleasure-boat. A lighter, a species of schooner.\r\n\r\nBALANUS. The acorn-shell. A sessile cirriped.\r\n\r\nBALCAR. _See_ BALKAR.\r\n\r\nBALCONY. The projecting open galleries of old line-of-battle ships'\r\nsterns, now disused.

A man placed on an eminence, like the ancient Olpis, to watch\r\nthe movements of shoals of fish. In our early statutes he is called\r\n_balcor_.\r\n\r\nBALL. In a general sense, implies a spherical and round body, whether\r\nnaturally so or formed into that figure by art. In a military view it\r\ncomprehends all sorts of bullets for fire-arms, from the cannon to the\r\npistol: also those pyrotechnic projectiles for guns or mortars, whether\r\nintended to destroy, or only to give light, smoke, or stench.\r\n\r\nBALLAHOU.

A clever adaptation to give astronomical or surveying\r\ninstruments full play and motion every way by a brass ball fitted into a\r\nspherical cell, and usually carried by an endless screw.\r\n\r\nBALLARAG, TO. To abuse or bully. Thus Warton of the French king--\r\n\r\n        \"You surely thought to _ballarag_ us\r\n    With your fine squadron off Cape Lagos.\"\r\n\r\nBALLAST. A certain portion of stone, pig-iron, gravel, water, or such\r\nlike materials, deposited in a ship's hold when she either has no cargo\r\nor too little to bring her sufficiently low in the water. It is used to\r\ncounter-balance the effect of the wind upon the masts, and give the ship\r\na proper stability, that she may be enabled to carry sail without\r\ndanger of overturning. The art of ballasting consists in placing the\r\ncentre of gravity, so as neither to be too high nor too low, too far\r\nforward nor too far aft, and that the surface of the water may nearly\r\nrise to the extreme breadth amidships, and thus the ship will be enabled\r\nto carry a good sail, incline but little, and ply well to windward. A\r\nwant of true knowledge in this department has led to putting too great a\r\nweight in ships' bottoms, which impedes their sailing and endangers\r\ntheir masts by excessive rolling, the consequence of bringing the centre\r\nof gravity too low. It should be trimmed with due regard to the\r\ncapacity, gravity, and flooring, and to the nature of whatever is to be\r\ndeposited thereon. (_See_ TRIM.)\r\n\r\nBALLAST. As a verb, signifies to steady;--as a substantive, a\r\ncomprehensive mind. A man is said to \"lose his ballast\" when his\r\njudgment fails him, or he becomes top-heavy from conceit.\r\n\r\nBALLASTAGE.

The original pendulum was of very massive construction, the\r\narc through which it receded when impinged on by the projectile, taking\r\ninto account their respective weights, afforded, with considerable\r\ncalculation, a measure of the velocity of impact. Latterly the\r\nelectro-ballistic pendulum, which by means of electric currents is made\r\nto register with very great accuracy the time occupied by the projectile\r\nin passing over a measured space, has superseded it, as being more\r\naccurate, less cumbrous, and less laborious in its accompanying\r\ncalculations.\r\n\r\nBALLIUM. A plot of ground in ancient fortifications: called also\r\n_baiky_.\r\n\r\nBALLOCH. Gaelic for the discharge of a river into a lake.\r\n\r\nBALLOEN.

This, with attention on the part of the\r\nengineers, will maintain the water hot, and a slight pressure of steam\r\nin the boilers. When fuel is added and draught induced the fires are\r\nsaid to be \"drawn forward,\" and steam is speedily generated.\r\n\r\nBANK-HARBOUR.

An accumulated shoal or bank of sand,\r\nshingle, gravel, or other uliginous substances, thrown up by the sea to\r\nthe mouth of a river or harbour, so as to endanger, and sometimes\r\ntotally prevent, the navigation into it.--_Bars of rivers_ are some\r\nshifting and some permanent. The position of the bar of any river may\r\ncommonly be guessed by attending to the form of the shores at the\r\nembouchure. The shore on which the deposition of sediment is going on\r\nwill be flat, whilst the opposite one is steep. It is along the side of\r\nthe latter that the deepest channel of the river lies; and in the line\r\nof this channel, but without the points that form the mouth of the\r\nriver, will be the _bar_. If both the shores are of the same nature,\r\nwhich seldom happens, the bar will lie opposite the middle of the\r\nchannel. Rivers in general have what may be deemed a bar, in respect of\r\nthe depth of the channel within, although it may not rise high enough to\r\nimpede the navigation--for the increased deposition that takes place\r\nwhen the current slackens, through the want of declivity, and of shores\r\nto retain it, must necessarily form a bank. Bars of small rivers may be\r\ndeepened by means of stockades to confine the river current, and prolong\r\nit beyond the natural points of the river's mouth. They operate to\r\nremove the place of deposition further out, and into deeper water. Bars,\r\nhowever, act as breakwaters in most instances, and consequently secure\r\nsmooth water within them. The deposit in all curvilinear or serpentine\r\nrivers will always be found at the point opposite to the curve into\r\nwhich the ebb strikes and rebounds, deepening the hollow and depositing\r\non the tongue. Therefore if it be deemed advisable to change the\r\nposition of a bar, it may be in some cases aided by works projected on\r\nthe last curve sea-ward. By such means a parallel canal may be forced\r\nwhich will admit vessels under the cover of the bar.--_Bar_, a boom\r\nformed of huge trees, or spars lashed together, moored transversely\r\nacross a port, to prevent entrance or egress.--_Bar_, the short bits of\r\nbar-iron, about half a pound each, used as the medium of traffic on the\r\nNegro coast.--_Bar-harbour_, one which, from a bar at its entrance,\r\ncannot admit ships of great burden, or can only do so at\r\nhigh-water.--_Capstan-bars_, large thick bars put into the holes of the\r\ndrumhead of the capstan, by which it is turned round, they working as\r\nhorizontal radial levers.--_Hatch-bars_, flat iron bars to lock over the\r\nhatches for security from theft, &c.--_Port-bar_, a piece of wood or\r\niron variously fitted to secure a gun-port when shut.--_Bar-shallow_, a\r\nterm sometimes applied to a portion of a bar with less water on it than\r\non other parts of the bar.--_Bar-shot_, two half balls joined together\r\nby a bar of iron, for cutting and destroying spars and rigging. When\r\nwhole balls are thus fitted they are more properly double-headed\r\nshot.--_To bar._ To secure the lower-deck ports, as above.\r\n\r\nBARACOOTA.

A rating on the ships' books for one who shaves the people, for\r\nwhich he receives the pay of an ordinary seaman. In meteorology,\r\n_barber_ is a singular vapour rising in streams from the sea\r\nsurface,--owing probably to exhalations being condensed into a visible\r\nform, on entering a cold atmosphere. It is well known on the shores of\r\nNova Scotia. Also, the condensed breath in frosty weather on beard or\r\nmoustaches in Arctic travelling.\r\n\r\nBARBETTE. A mode of mounting guns to fire over the parapet, so as to\r\nhave free range, instead of through embrasures.\r\n\r\nBARCA-LONGA.

A boat of a long, slight, and spacious construction, generally\r\ncarvel-built, double-banked, for the use of admirals and captains of\r\nships of war.--_Barge_, in boat attacks, is next in strength to the\r\nlaunch. It is likewise a vessel or boat of state, furnished and equipped\r\nin the most sumptuous style;--and of this sort we may naturally suppose\r\nto have been the famous barge or galley of Cleopatra, which, according\r\nto the beautiful description of Shakspeare--\r\n\r\n                          \"Like a burnished throne\r\n    Burnt on the water: the poop was beaten gold,\r\n    Purple her sails; and so perfumed, that\r\n    The winds were love-sick with them; the oars were silver.\r\n    Which to the tune of flutes kept time, and made\r\n    The water which they beat to follow faster\r\n    As amorous of their strokes.\"\r\n\r\nThe barges of the lord-mayor, civic companies, &c., and the coal-barges\r\nof the Thames are varieties. Also, an early man-of-war, of about 100\r\ntons. Also, an east-country vessel of peculiar construction.

A general name given to small\r\nships, square-sterned, without head-rails; it is, however, peculiarly\r\nappropriated by seamen to a three-masted vessel with only fore-and-aft\r\nsails on her mizen-mast.--_Bark-rigged._ Rigged as a bark, with no\r\nsquare sails on the mizen-mast.\r\n\r\nBARKANTINE, OR BARQUANTINE. A name applied on the great lakes of North\r\nAmerica to a vessel square-rigged on the fore-mast, and fore-and-aft\r\nrigged on the main and mizen masts.

(vide old\r\ncyclopedias): the poet, however, was too good a naturalist to believe\r\nthis, but here, as in many other places, he means to banter some of the\r\npapers which were published by the first establishers of the Royal\r\nSociety. The shell is compressed and multivalve. The tentacula are long\r\nand pectinated like a feather, whence arose the fable of their becoming\r\ngeese. They belong to the order of _Cirripeds_.\r\n\r\nBARNAGH. The Manx or Gaelic term for a limpet.\r\n\r\nBAROMETER. A glass tube of 36 inches in length, filled with the open end\r\nupwards with refined mercury--thus boiled and suddenly inverted into a\r\ncistern, which is furnished with a leathern bag, on which the\r\natmosphere, acting by its varying weight, presses the fluid metal up to\r\ncorresponding heights in the tube, easily read off by an external scale\r\nattached thereto. By attentive observations on this simple prophet,\r\npractised seamen are enabled to foretell many approaching changes of\r\nwind or weather, and thus by shortening sail in time, save hull, spars,\r\nand lives. This instrument also affords the means of accurately\r\ndetermining the heights or depressions of mountains and valleys. This is\r\nthe _mercurial_ barometer; another, the _aneroid_ barometer, invented by\r\nMonsr. Vidi, measures approximately, but not with the permanence of the\r\nmercurial. It is constructed to measure the weight of a column of air or\r\npressure of the atmosphere, by pressure on a very delicate metallic box\r\nhermetically sealed. It is more sensible to passing changes, but not so\r\nreliable as the mercurial barometer. 29.60 is taken as the mean pressure\r\nin England; as it rises or falls below this mark, fine weather or strong\r\nwinds may be looked for:--30.60 is very high, and 29.00 very low. The\r\nbarometer is affected by the direction of the wind, thus N.N.E. is the\r\nhighest, and S.S.W. the lowest--therefore these matters govern the\r\ndecision of men of science, who are not led astray by the change of\r\nreading alone. The seaman pilot notes the heavens; the direction of the\r\nwind--and the pressure due to that direction--not forgetting sudden\r\nchanges of temperature. Attention is due to the surface, whether convex\r\nor concave.\r\n\r\nBARQUE. The same as _bark_ (which see).\r\n\r\nBARR. A peremptory exception to a proposition.\r\n\r\nBARRA-BOATS. Vessels of the Western Isles of Scotland, carrying ten or\r\ntwelve men. They are extremely sharp fore and aft, having no floor, but\r\nwith sides rising straight from the keel, so that a transverse section\r\nresembles the letter V. They are swift and safe, for in proportion as\r\nthey heel to a breeze their bearings are increased, while from their\r\nlightness they are as buoyant as Norway skiffs.\r\n\r\nBARRACAN. A strong undiapered camblet, used for garments in the Levant\r\nand in Barbary; anciently it formed the Roman toga.\r\n\r\nBARRACK-MASTER. The officer placed in charge of a barrack.\r\n\r\nBARRACKS.

A strong wooden rail, supported by stanchions extending as a\r\nfence across the foremost part of the quarter-deck, on the top of which\r\nsome of the seamen's hammocks are usually stowed in time of battle. In a\r\nvessel of war the vacant spaces between the stanchions are commonly\r\nfilled with rope-mats, cork, or pieces of old cable; and the upper part,\r\nwhich contains a double rope-netting above the sail, is stuffed with\r\nfull hammocks to intercept small shot in the time of battle. Also, a\r\ntemporary fortification or fence made with abatis, palisades, or any\r\nobstacles, to bar the approach of an enemy by a given avenue.\r\n\r\nBARRIER OF ICE.

When a ship that was to windward comes under another ship's stern,\r\nand so gives her the wind, she is said to bear under the lee; often as a\r\nmark of respect. She bears in with the land, is said of a ship when she\r\nruns towards the shore.

It is also\r\nthe situation of any distant object, estimated with regard to the ship's\r\nposition; and in this sense the object must bear either ahead, astern,\r\nabreast, on the bow, or on the quarter; if a ship sails with a side\r\nwind, a distant object is said to bear to leeward or to windward, on the\r\nlee quarter or bow, or on the weather quarter or bow.\r\n\r\nBEARING BACKSTAYS AFT.

Used for vessels of very light draught and flattish\r\nbottoms, to make them hold a better wind, also to support them upright\r\nwhen grounded.

Another name for bilge-coads.\r\n\r\nBILGE-WATER. The rain or sea-water which occasionally enters a vessel,\r\nand running down to her floor, remains in the bilge of the ship till\r\npumped out, by reason of her flat bottom, which prevents it from going\r\nto the well of the pump; it is always (especially if the ship does not\r\nleak) of a dirty colour and disgusting penetrating smell. It seems to\r\nhave been a sad nuisance in early voyages; and in the earliest\r\nsea-ballad known (_temp._ Hen. VI.) it is thus grumbled at:--\r\n\r\n    \"A sak of strawe were there ryght good,\r\n    For som must lyg theym in theyr hood,\r\n    I had as lefe be in the wood\r\n                      W'out mete or drynk.\r\n    For when that we shall go to bedde,\r\n    The pumpe was nygh our bedde's hedde;\r\n    A man were as good to be dede\r\n                      As smell thereof ye stynk.\"\r\n\r\nThe mixture of tar-water and the drainings of sugar cargo is about the\r\nworst perfume known.\r\n\r\nBILL.

A memorandum by which the master of a ship acknowledges\r\nthe receipt of the goods specified therein, and promises to deliver\r\nthem, in like good condition, to the consignee, or his order.

The binnacle is a wooden\r\ncase or box, which contains the compass, and a light to illuminate the\r\ncompass at night; there are usually three binnacles on the deck of a\r\nship-of-war, two near the helm being designed for the man who steers,\r\nweather and lee, and the other amidships, 10 or 12 feet before these,\r\nwhere the quarter-master, who conns the ship, stands when _steering_, or\r\ngoing with a free wind.

Bread intended for\r\nnaval or military expeditions is now simply flour well kneaded, with the\r\nleast possible quantity of water, into flat cakes, and slowly baked.\r\nPliny calls it _panis nauticus_; and of the _panis militaris_, he says\r\nthat it was heavier by one-third than the grain from which it was made.\r\n\r\nBISHOP.

A north-country name for the bittern.\r\n\r\nBITTER-END. That part of the cable which is abaft the bitts, and\r\ntherefore within board when the ship rides at anchor. They say, \"Bend to\r\nthe bitter-end\" when they would have that end bent to the anchor, and\r\nwhen a chain or rope is paid out to the bitter-end, no more remains to\r\nbe let go. The bitter-end is the clinching end--sometimes that end is\r\nbent to the anchor, because it has never been used, and is more\r\ntrustworthy. The first 40 fathoms of a cable of 115 fathoms is generally\r\nworn out when the inner end is comparatively new.\r\n\r\nBITT-HEADS. The upright pieces of oak-timber let in and bolted to the\r\nbeams of two decks at least, and to which the cross-pieces are let on\r\nand bolted. (_See_ BITTS.)\r\n\r\nBITT-PINS.

A frame composed of two strong pieces of straight oak timber,\r\nfixed upright in the fore-part of a ship, and bolted securely to the\r\nbeams, whereon to fasten the cables as she rides at anchor; in ships of\r\nwar there are usually two pairs of cable-bitts, and when they are both\r\nused at once the cable is said to be double-bitted. Since the\r\nintroduction of chain-cables, bitts are coated with iron, and vary in\r\ntheir shapes. There are several other smaller bitts; as, the\r\ntopsail-sheet bitts, paul-bitts, carrick-bitts, windlass-bitts,\r\nwinch-bitts, jear-bitts, riding-bitts, gallows-bitts, and fore-brace\r\nbitts.\r\n\r\nBITT-STOPPER. One rove through the knee of the bitts, which nips the\r\ncable on the bight: it consists of four or five fathoms of rope tailed\r\nout nipper fashion at one end, and clench-knotted at the other. The old\r\nbitt-stopper, by its running loop on a standing end, bound the cable\r\ndown in a bight abaft the bitts--the tail twisted round the fore part\r\nhelped to draw it still closer. It is now disused--chain cables having\r\nsuperseded hemp.\r\n\r\nBITT THE CABLE, TO. To put it round the bitts, in order to fasten it, or\r\nslacken it out gradually, which last is called veering away.\r\n\r\nBIVOUAC.

This squall, although generally ascribed to the West\r\nIndies, as well as the white squall, may be principally ascribed to a\r\npeculiar heated state of the atmosphere near land. As blackey, when\r\ninterrogated about weather, generally observes, \"Massa, look to\r\nleeward,\" it may be easily understood that it is the condensed air\r\nrepelled by a colder medium to leeward, and driven back with condensed\r\nelectricity and danger. So it is sudden to Johnny Newcomes, who lose\r\nsails, spars, and ships, by capsizing.\r\n\r\nBLACK'S THE WHITE OF MY EYE. When Jack avers that no one can say this or\r\nthat of him. It is an indignant expression of innocence of a charge.\r\n\r\nBLACK-STRAKE. The range of plank immediately above the wales in a ship's\r\nside; they are always covered with a mixture of tar and lamp-black,\r\nwhich not only preserves them from the heat of the sun and the weather,\r\nbut forms an agreeable variety with the painted or varnished parts above\r\nthem. Vessels with no ports have frequently two such strakes--one above,\r\nthe other below the wales, the latter being also called the diminishing\r\nstrake.\r\n\r\nBLACK-STRAP.

Is the flat part of it which is plunged into\r\nthe water in rowing. The force and effect in a great measure depends on\r\nthe length of this part, when adequate force is applied.

In Greenland blink means\r\niceberg.\r\n\r\nBLIRT. A gust of wind and rain.\r\n\r\nBLOAT, TO. To dry by smoke; a method latterly applied almost exclusively\r\nto cure herrings or bloaters.--_Bloated_ is also applied to any\r\nhalf-dried fish.\r\n\r\nBLOCCO. Paper and hair used in paying a vessel's bottom.\r\n\r\nBLOCK. (In mechanics termed a pulley.) Blocks are flattish oval pieces\r\nof wood, with sheaves in them, for all the running ropes to run in. They\r\nare used for various purposes in a ship, either to increase the\r\nmechanical power of the ropes, or to arrange the ends of them in certain\r\nplaces on the deck, that they may be readily found when wanted; they are\r\nconsequently of various sizes and powers, and obtain various names,\r\naccording to their form or situation, thus:--A single block contains\r\nonly one sheave or wheel. A double block has two sheaves. A treble or\r\nthreefold block, three, and so on. A long-tackle or fiddle-block has two\r\nsheaves--one below the other, like a fiddle. Cistern or sister block for\r\ntop-sail lifts and reef tackles. Every block is composed of three, and\r\ngenerally four, parts:--(1.) The shell, or outside wooden part. (2.) The\r\nsheave, or wheel, on which the rope runs. (3.) The pin, or axle, on\r\nwhich the sheave turns. (4.) The strop, or part by which the block is\r\nmade fast to any particular station, and is usually made either of rope\r\nor of iron. Blocks are named and distinguished by the ropes which they\r\ncarry, and the uses they serve for, as bowlines, braces, clue-lines,\r\nhalliards, &c. &c. They are either _made_ or _morticed_ (which see).\r\n\r\nBLOCK. The large piece of elm out of which the figure is carved at the\r\nhead of the ship.\r\n\r\nBLOCKADE. The investment of a town or fortress by sea and land; shutting\r\nup all the avenues, so that it can receive no relief.--_To blockade a\r\nport_ is to prevent any communication therewith by sea, and cut off\r\nsupplies, in order to compel a surrender when the provisions and\r\nammunition are exhausted.--_To raise a blockade_ is to discontinue\r\nit.--Blockade is violated by egress as well as by ingress. Warning on\r\nthe spot is sufficient notice of a blockade _de facto_. Declaration is\r\nuseless without actual investment. If a ship break a blockade, though\r\nshe escape the blockading force, she is, if taken in any part of her\r\nfuture voyage, captured _in delicto_, and subject to confiscation. The\r\nabsence of the blockading force removes liability, and _might_ (in such\r\ncases) overrules _right_.\r\n\r\nBLOCK AND BLOCK. The situation of a tackle when the blocks are drawn\r\nclose together, so that the mechanical power becomes arrested until the\r\ntackle is again overhauled by drawing the blocks asunder. Synonymous\r\nwith chock-a-block.\r\n\r\nBLOCKHOUSE. A small work, generally built of logs, to protect adjacent\r\nports. Blockhouses were primarily constructed in our American colonies,\r\nbecause they could be immediately built from the heavy timber felled to\r\nclear away the spot, and open the lines of fire. The ends were simply\r\ncrossed alternately and pinned. Two such structures, with a space of 6\r\nfeet for clay, formed, on an elevated position, a very formidable\r\ncasemated work. The slanting overhanging roof furnished excellent cover\r\nin lieu of loop-holes for musketry.\r\n\r\nBLOCK-MAKER. A manufacturer of blocks.\r\n\r\nBLOCKS. The several transverse pieces or logs of timber, piled in plane,\r\non which a ship is built, or to place her on for repair: they consist of\r\nsolid pieces of oak laid on the ground-ways.\r\n\r\nBLOCKS, FIXED. _See_ FIXED BLOCKS.\r\n\r\nBLOOD-SUCKERS. Lazy fellows, who, by skulking, throw their proportion of\r\nlabour on the shoulders of their shipmates.\r\n\r\nBLOODY FLAG. A large red flag.\r\n\r\nBLOOM. A peculiar warm blast of wind; a term used in iron-foundries.\r\n\r\nBLORE. An old word for a stiff gale.\r\n\r\nBLOUT. A northern term for the sudden breaking-up of a storm. Blout has\r\nbeen misused for blirt.\r\n\r\nBLOW. Applied to the breathing of whales and other cetaceans. The\r\nexpired air from the lungs being highly charged with moisture, which\r\ncondenses at the temperature of the atmosphere, appears like a column of\r\nsteam.\r\n\r\nBLOW. A gale of wind.\r\n\r\nBLOWE. A very old English word for scold or revile, still in use, as\r\nwhen a man receives a good blowing-up.\r\n\r\nBLOW-HOLES.

The wind does not cease or moderate till it comes past that\r\nplace, blowing continuously over the land and sea with equal velocity.\r\nIn a naval sense, it does not blow home when a sea-wind is interrupted\r\nby a mountainous range along shore.\r\n\r\nBLOWING GREAT GUNS AND SMALL ARMS. Heavy gales; a hurricane.\r\n\r\nBLOWING HARD. Said of the wind when it is strong and steady.\r\n\r\nBLOWING THE GRAMPUS. Throwing water over a sleeper on watch.\r\n\r\nBLOWING WEATHER. A nautical term for a continuance of strong gales.\r\n(_See_ GALE.)\r\n\r\nBLOWN COD. A split cod, half dried by exposure to the wind. _Blown_ is\r\nalso frequently applied to bloated herrings, when only partly cured.\r\nAlso, a cod-fish rises to the surface, and is easily taken, if blown. By\r\nbeing hauled nearly up, and the hook breaking, it loses the power for\r\nsome time of contracting the air-bladder, and thus dies head out of\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nBLOWN ITSELF OUT. Said of a falling gale of wind.\r\n\r\nBLOW OFF, TO. To clear up in the clouds.\r\n\r\nBLOW-OFF-PIPE, in a steamer, is a pipe at the foot of each boiler,\r\ncommunicating with the sea, and furnished with a cock to open and shut\r\nit.--_Blowing-off_ is the act or operation of using the blow-off-pipe to\r\ncleanse a marine steam-engine of its brine deposit; also, to clear the\r\nboilers of water, to lighten a ship if grounded.\r\n\r\nBLOW-OUT. Extravagant feasting regardless of consequences.\r\n\r\nBLOW OVER, (IT WILL). Said of a gale which is expected to pass away\r\nquickly.\r\n\r\nBLOW-PIPE. An engine of offence used by the Araucanians and Borneans,\r\nand with the latter termed _sumpitan_: the poisoned arrow, _sumpit_,\r\nwill wound at the distance of 140 or more yards. The arrow is forced\r\nthrough (like boys' pea-shooters) by the forcible and sudden exertion of\r\nthe lungs. A wafer can be hit at 30 yards to a certainty, and small\r\nbirds are unerringly stunned at 30 yards by pellets of clay.\r\n\r\nBLOW THE GAFF. To reveal a secret; to expose or inform against a person.\r\n\r\nBLOW-THROUGH VALVE.

Also,\r\nthe space comprehended between any two places when the ship changes her\r\ncourse by tacking; or, it is the line over which she runs between tack\r\nand tack when working to windward, or sailing against the direction of\r\nthe wind.--_To make a good board._ To sail in a straight line when\r\nclose-hauled, without deviating to leeward.--_To make short boards_, is\r\nto tack frequently before the ship has run any great length of way.--_To\r\nmake a stern board_, is when by a current, or any other accident, the\r\nvessel comes head to wind, the helm is shifted, and she has fallen back\r\non the opposite tack, losing what she had gained, instead of having\r\nadvanced beyond it. To make a stern board is frequently a very critical\r\nas well as seamanlike operation, as in very close channels. The vessel\r\nis allowed to run up into the wind until she has shot up to the weather\r\ndanger; the helm is then shifted, and with all aback forward, she falls\r\nshort off on the opposite tack. Such is also achieved at anchor in\r\nclub-hauling (which see).--_To board a ship_, is to enter her in a\r\nhostile manner in order to take forcible possession of her, either from\r\nthe attacking ship or by armed boats. The word _board_ has various other\r\napplications among seamen:--_To go aboard_ signifies to go into the\r\nship.--_To slip by the board_, is to slip down a ship's side.--_To board\r\nit up_, is to beat up, sometimes on one tack and sometimes on\r\nanother.--_The weather-board_ is the side of the ship which is to\r\nwindward.--_By the board_, close to a ship's deck.\r\n\r\nBOARD AND BOARD.

He pipes the hands to\r\ntheir several duties, seeing that they attend his call, and ought to be\r\nin every way a thorough seaman. Although termed boatswain, the boats are\r\nnot in his charge. They, with the spars, &c., and stores for repair,\r\nbelong to the carpenter. The boatswain is the officer of the first\r\nlieutenant; he gives no order, but reports defects, and carries out the\r\nwill of his superior.\r\n\r\nBOATSWAIN-BIRD. _Phaethon aethereus_, a tropical bird, so called from its\r\nsort of whistle.

Iron plates by which the lower end of the bobstay is\r\nattached to the stem.\r\n\r\nBOBSTAYS. Ropes or chains used to confine the bowsprit downward to the\r\nstem or cut-water. They are fitted in various ways. Their use is to\r\ncounteract the strain of the foremast-stays, which draw it upwards. The\r\nbowsprit is also fortified by shrouds from the bows on each side, which\r\nare all very necessary, as the fore-mast and the upper spars on the\r\nmain-mast are stayed and greatly supported by the bowsprit.\r\n\r\nBOCCA. [Sp. _boca_, mouth.] Is a term used both in the Levant, and on\r\nthe north coast of South America, or the Spanish Main, for a mouth or\r\nchannel into any port or harbour, or the entrance into a sound which has\r\na passage out by a contrary way.--_Bocca Tigris_, Canton River.\r\n\r\nBODIES.

There were also very diminutive varieties of it. It has been\r\nvaguely called by some writers _basilisk_, and by the Dutch\r\n_donderbass_. Used to assail a town, fortress, or fleet, by the\r\nprojection of shells from mortars. It was also the name of a barrel, or\r\nlarge vessel for liquids; hence, among other choice epithets, Prince\r\nHenry calls that \"tun of man,\" Falstaff, a \"huge bombard of sack.\" Also,\r\na Mediterranean vessel, with two masts like the English ketch.\r\n\r\nBOMB-BED BEAMS.

Thus we say, \"Lace on the bonnet,\" or \"Shake off the bonnet.\"\r\nBonnets have lately been introduced to secure the foot of an\r\nupper-topsail to a lower-topsail yard. The unbonnetted sail is for storm\r\nservice. Bonnet, in fortification, is a raised portion of the works at\r\nany salient angle, having the same plan, but 10 or 12 feet more command\r\nthan the work on which it is based.

This is chiefly performed where\r\nthere is no dock or other commodious situation for breaming or\r\ncareening, or when the hurry of a voyage renders it inconvenient to have\r\nthe whole bottom properly trimmed and cleansed. The term is now applied\r\nto sheathing a vessel with planking over felt.\r\n\r\nBOOTY. That sort of prize which may be distributed at the capstan-head,\r\nor at once.\r\n\r\nBOOZE.

An old word for houses built along a strand. In the old play\r\ncalled the \"Ladies' Privilege,\" it is said:--\"These gentlemen know\r\nbetter to cut a caper than a cable, or board a pink in the bordels than\r\na pinnace.\"\r\n\r\nBORDER.

A sudden and rapid flow of tide in certain inlets of the sea; as\r\nthe monstrous wave in the river Hooghly, called _bahu_ by the natives,\r\nwhich rolls in with the noise of distant thunder at flood-tide. It\r\noccurs from February to November, at the new and full moon. Its cause\r\nhas not been clearly defined, although it probably arises from the\r\ncurrents during spring-tides, acting on a peculiar conformation of the\r\nbanks and bed of the river; it strikes invariably on the same part of\r\nthe banks, majestically rolling over to one side, and passing on\r\ndiagonally to the other with impetuous violence. The bore also occurs in\r\nEngland, near Bristol; and in America, in several rivers, but especially\r\nin the Bay of Fundy, where at the river Petticodiac the tide rises 76\r\nfeet. It also occurs in Borneo and several rivers in the East. (_See_\r\nHYGRE.) Also, the interior cavity of a piece of ordnance, generally\r\ncylindrical in shape, except when a part of it is modified into a\r\nchamber.\r\n\r\nBOREAS.

Sailed down from to windward.\r\n\r\nBORHAME. A northern term for the flounder.\r\n\r\nBORING. In Arctic seas, the operation of forcing the ship through loose\r\nice under a heavy press of sail; at least attempting the chance of\r\nadvantage of cracks or openings in the pack.\r\n\r\nBORN WITH A SILVER SPOON IN HIS MOUTH. Said of a person who, by birth\r\nor connection, has all the usual obstacles to advancement cleared away\r\nfor him. Those who toil unceasingly for preferment, and toil in vain,\r\nare said to have been born with a wooden ladle.

An old English term for boat, and assuredly the damaged boat into\r\nwhich Prospero is turned adrift by Shakspeare.\r\n\r\nBOTTLE-BUMP. The bittern, so called on our east coast.\r\n\r\nBOTTLE-CHARTS. Those on which the set of surface currents are exhibited,\r\nderived from papers found in bottles which have been thrown overboard\r\nfor that purpose, and washed up on the beach, or picked up by other\r\nships.\r\n\r\nBOTTLE-NOSE, OR BOTTLE-NOSED WHALE. A name applied to several of the\r\nsmaller cetaceans of the northern seas, more especially to the\r\n_Hyperoodon rostratus_.\r\n\r\nBOTTOM. A name for rich low land formed by alluvial deposits: but in a\r\ngeneral sense it denotes the lowest part of a thing, in\r\ncontradistinction to the top or uppermost part. In navigation, it is\r\nused to denote as well the channel of rivers and harbours as the body or\r\nhull of a ship. Thus, in the former sense we say \"a gravelly bottom,\r\nclayey bottom,\" &c., and in the latter sense \"a British bottom, a Dutch\r\nbottom,\" &c. By statute, certain commodities imported in foreign bottoms\r\npay a duty called \"petty customs,\" over and above what they are liable\r\nto if imported in British bottoms. Bottom of a ship or boat is that part\r\nwhich is below the wales.\r\n\r\nBOTTOM-CLEAN. Thoroughly clean, free from weeds, &c.\r\n\r\nBOTTOM-PLANK. That which is placed between the garboard-strake and lower\r\nback-strake.\r\n\r\nBOTTOMREE, OR BOTTOMRY-BOND. The contract of bottomry is a negotiable\r\ninstrument, which may be put in suit by the person to whom it is\r\ntransferred: it is in use in all countries of maritime commerce and\r\ninterests. A contract in the nature of a mortgage of a ship, when the\r\nowner of it borrows money to enable him to carry on the voyage, and\r\npledge the keel, or bottom of the ship, as a security for the repayment.\r\nIf the ship be lost the lender also loses his whole money; but if it\r\nreturn in safety then he shall receive back his principal, and also the\r\npremium stipulated to be paid, however it may exceed the usual or legal\r\nrate of interest. The affair is, however, only regarded as valid upon\r\nthe ground of necessity; and thus exacting more than the interest\r\nallowed by law is not deemed usury.\r\n\r\nBOTTOMRY PREMIUM. A high rate of interest charged on the safety of the\r\nship--the lender losing his whole money if she be lost.\r\n\r\nBOTTOM-WIND.

A work against the encroachment of the sea, made of wooden\r\nstakes.\r\n\r\nBOULDERS. Stones worn and rounded by the attrition of the waves of the\r\nsea: the word, on the authority of Hunter, was considered a technical\r\nterm in the fourteenth century, as appears in a warrant of John of Gaunt\r\nfor the repair of Pontefract Castle--\"De peres, appeles buldres, a n're\r\ndit chastel come nous semblerez resonables pur la defense de meisme.\"\r\n\r\nBOULEPONGES. A drink to which many of the deaths of Europeans in India\r\nwere ascribed; but in Bernier's \"Travels,\" in the train of Aurungzebe,\r\nin 1664, we are informed that \"bouleponge is a beverage made of arrack,\r\nsugar, lemon-juice, and a little muscadine.\" Probably a corruption of\r\nbowls of punch.

Two long chase-guns placed forward in the bow-ports to fire\r\ndirectly ahead, and being of small bore for their length, carry shot to\r\na great distance.\r\n\r\nBOWD-EATEN. An old expression for eaten by weevils.\r\n\r\nBOWER-ANCHORS. Those at the bows and in constant working use. They are\r\ncalled best and small, not from a difference of size, but as to the bow\r\non which they are placed; starboard being the best bower, and port the\r\nsmall bower. The appropriated cables assume the respective names. (_See\r\nalso_ SPARE ANCHOR, SHEET, STREAM, COASTING, KEDGE, &c.)\r\n\r\nBOW-FAST. A rope or chain for securing a vessel by the bow. (_See_\r\nFAST.)\r\n\r\nBOWGE, OR BOUGE. An old term for bilge.\r\n\r\nBOWGER. A name given in the Hebrides to the coulter-neb, or puffin\r\n(_Fratercula arctica_).\r\n\r\nBOWGRACE. A kind of frame or fender of old junk, placed round the bows\r\nand sides of a ship to prevent her receiving injury from floating ice or\r\ntimbers. (_See_ BON GRACE.)\r\n\r\nBOWING.

A rope leading forward which is fastened to a space connected\r\nby bridles to cringles on the leech or perpendicular edge of the square\r\nsails: it is used to keep the weather-edge of the sail tight forward and\r\nsteady when the ship is close hauled to the wind; and which, indeed,\r\nbeing hauled taut, enables the ship to come nearer to the wind. Hence\r\nthe ship sails on a bowline, or stands on a taut bowline.--_To check or\r\ncome up a bowline_ is to slacken it when the wind becomes large or\r\nfree.--_To sharp or set taut a bowline_ is to pull it as taut as it can\r\nwell bear.\r\n\r\nBOWLINE-BEND. The mode of bending warps or hawsers together by taking a\r\nbowline in the end of one rope, and passing the end of the other through\r\nthe bight, and making a bowline upon it.\r\n\r\nBOWLINE-BRIDLE. The span attached to the cringles on the leech of a\r\nsquare sail to which the bowline is toggled or clinched.\r\n\r\nBOWLINE-CRINGLE. An eye worked into the leech-rope of a sail; usually in\r\nthat of a fore-sail two, a main-sail three, and the fore-topsails three,\r\nbut the main-topsail four. By these the sails are found in the dark, by\r\nfeeling alone.\r\n\r\nBOWLINE HAUL. A hearty and simultaneous bowse. (_See_ ONE! TWO!!\r\nTHREE!!!) In hauling the bowline it is customary for the leading man to\r\nveer, and then haul, three times in succession, singing out one, two,\r\nthree--at the last the weight of all the men is thrown in together:\r\nthis is followed by \"belay, oh!\" When the bowlines are reported\r\n\"bowlines hauled, sir,\" by the officer in command of the fore-part of\r\nthe ship, the hands, or the watch, return to their duties.\r\n\r\nBOWLINE-KNOT. That by which the bowline-bridles were fastened to the\r\ncringles: the bowline-knot is made by an involution of the end and a\r\nbight upon the standing part of a rope. A further involution makes what\r\nis termed a bowline on a bight. It is very difficult to explain by\r\nwords:--holding the rope some distance from the end by the left hand,\r\nthe end held in the right is laid on the main part, and by a twist given\r\nscrew-fashion to the right, a loop or kink is formed inclosing this end,\r\nwhich is then passed behind, and back in the same direction with the\r\nformer, and then jammed home. It is rapidly done, easily undone, and one\r\nof the most seamanlike acts, exhibiting grace as well as power. It can\r\nbe made by a man with but one arm.\r\n\r\nBOW-LINES. In ship-building, longitudinal curves representing the ship's\r\nfore-body cut in a vertical section.\r\n\r\nBOWLING-ALONG. Going with a free wind.\r\n\r\nBOW-LOG TIMBERS.

A rail round the bows.\r\n\r\nBOWSE, TO. To pull upon any body with a tackle, or complication of\r\npulleys, in order to remove it, &c. Hauling upon a tack is called\r\n\"bowsing upon a tack,\" and when they would have the men pull all\r\ntogether, they cry, \"Bowse away.\" Also used in setting up rigging, as\r\n\"Bowse away, starboard;\" \"Bowse away, port.\" It is, however, mostly a\r\ngun-tackle term.--_Bowse up the jib_, a colloquialism to denote the act\r\nof tippling: it is an old phrase, and was probably derived from the\r\nDutch _buyzen_, to booze.\r\n\r\nBOWSPRIT, OR BOLT-SPRIT. A large spar, ranking with a lower-mast,\r\nprojecting over the stem; beyond it extends the jib-boom, and beyond\r\nthat again the flying jib-boom. To these spars are secured the stays of\r\nthe fore-mast and of the spars above it; on these stays are set the fore\r\nand fore-topmast staysails, the jib, and flying-jib, which have a most\r\nuseful influence in counter-balancing the pressure of the after-sails,\r\nthereby tending to force the ship ahead instead of merely turning her\r\nround. In former times underneath these spars were set a sprit-sail,\r\nsprit-topsail, &c.\r\n\r\nBOWSPRIT, RUNNING. In cutter-rigged vessels. (_See_ CUTTER.)\r\n\r\nBOWSPRIT-BITTS. Are strong upright timbers secured to the beams below\r\nthe deck; they have a cross-piece bolted to them, the inner end of the\r\nbowsprit steps between them, and is thus prevented from slipping in. The\r\ncross-piece prevents it from canting up.\r\n\r\nBOWSPRIT-CAP. The crance or cap on the outer end of the bowsprit,\r\nthrough which the jib-boom traverses.\r\n\r\nBOWSPRIT-GEAR. A term denoting the ropes, blocks, &c., belonging to the\r\nbowsprit.\r\n\r\nBOWSPRIT-HEART. The heart or block of wood used to secure the lower end\r\nof the fore-stay, through which the inner end of the jib-boom is\r\ninserted. It is seldom, if ever, used now, an iron band round the\r\nbowsprit, with an eye on each side for the fore-stays, being preferred.\r\n\r\nBOWSPRIT-HORSES. The ridge-ropes which extend from the bowsprit-cap to\r\nthe knight-heads.\r\n\r\nBOWSPRIT-LADDER. Skids over the bowsprit from the beak-head in some\r\nships, to enable men to run out upon the bowsprit.\r\n\r\nBOWSPRIT-NETTING. The netting placed just above a vessel's bowsprit, for\r\nstowing away the fore-topmast staysail; it is usually lashed between the\r\nridge-ropes.\r\n\r\nBOWSPRIT-SHROUDS. Strong ropes or chains leading from nearly the outer\r\nend of the bowsprit to the luff of the bow, giving lateral support to\r\nthat spar.\r\n\r\nBOW-STAVES. Early supplied to our men-of-war.\r\n\r\nBOW-TIMBERS. Those which form the bow of the ship.\r\n\r\nBOX.

Each ordinary pump has an upper and lower box, the\r\none a fixture in the lower part of its chamber, the other attached to\r\nthe end of the spear or piston-rod; in the centre of each box is a valve\r\nopening upwards.\r\n\r\nBOXHAULING. Is an evolution by which a ship is veered sharp round on her\r\nheel, when the object is to avoid making a great sweep. The helm is put\r\na-lee, the head-yards braced flat aback, the after-yards squared, the\r\ndriver taken in, and the head-sheets hauled to windward; when she begins\r\nto gather stern-way the helm is shifted and sails trimmed. It is only\r\nresorted to in emergencies, as a seaman never likes to see his ship have\r\nstern-way. With much wind and sea this evolution would be dangerous.\r\n\r\nBOXING. A square piece of dry hard wood, used in connecting the frame\r\ntimbers. Also, the projection formerly left at the hawse-pieces, in the\r\nwake of the hawse-holes, where the planks do not run through; now\r\ndisused. The stem is said to be boxed when it is joined to the fore end\r\nof the keel by a side scarph. (_See_ BOXING OF RUDDER.)\r\n\r\nBOXING OFF. Is performed by hauling the head-sheets to windward, and\r\nlaying the head-yards flat aback, to pay the ship's head out of the\r\nwind, when the action of the helm alone is not sufficient for that\r\npurpose; as when she is got \"in irons.\"\r\n\r\nBOX THE COMPASS, TO. Not only to repeat the names of the thirty-two\r\npoints in order and backwards, but also to be able to answer any and all\r\nquestions respecting its divisions.\r\n\r\nBOYART.

The braces are ropes belonging to all the yards of a ship; two to\r\neach yard, rove through blocks that are stropped to the yards, or\r\nfastened to pendants, seized to the yard-arms. Their use is either to\r\nsquare or traverse the yards horizontally; hence, _to brace the yard_,\r\nis to bring it to either side by means of the braces. In ship-building,\r\nbraces are plates of iron, copper, or mixed metal, which are used to\r\nbind efficiently a weakness in a vessel; as also to receive the pintles\r\nby which the rudder is hung.\r\n\r\nBRACE ABACK. To brace the yards in, so as to lay the sails aback.--_To\r\nbrace about_, to turn the yards round for the contrary tack, or in\r\nconsequence of a change of wind.--_To brace abox_, a man[oe]uvre to\r\ninsure casting the right way, by bracing the head-yards flat aback (not\r\nsquare).--_To brace by_, to brace the yards in contrary directions to\r\neach other on the different masts, to effect the stopping of the vessel.\r\n(_See_ COUNTER-BRACE.)--_To brace in_, to lay the yard less oblique, as\r\nfor a free wind, or nearly square.--_To brace round_, synonymous with\r\nbrace about.--_To brace sharp_, to cause the yards to have the smallest\r\npossible angle with the keel, for the ship to have head-way: deemed\r\ngenerally to form an angle of 20 deg. with the keel.--_To brace to_, is\r\nto check or ease off the lee braces, and round in the weather ones, to\r\nassist in the man[oe]uvre of tacking or wearing.--_To brace up_, or\r\n_brace sharp up_, to lay the yards more obliquely fore and aft, by\r\neasing off the weather-braces and hauling in the lee ones, which enables\r\na ship to lie as close to the wind as possible.\r\n\r\nBRACE OF SHAKES. A moment: taken from the flapping of a sail. I will be\r\nwith you before it shakes thrice.\r\n\r\nBRACE PENDANTS. Are lengths of rope, or now more generally chain, into\r\nwhich the yard-arm brace-blocks are spliced. They are used in the\r\nmerchant service to save rope, to give the blocks more freedom for\r\nslewing to their work, but chiefly because when the brace is let go, the\r\nfalling chain will overhaul it, making it easier to haul in the other\r\nbrace.\r\n\r\nBRACE UP AND HAUL AFT! The order usually given after being hove-to, with\r\nfore or main top-sail square or aback, and jib-sheet flowing, _i.e._\r\nhaul aft jib-sheet, brace up the yards which had been squared, for the\r\npurpose of heaving to.\r\n\r\nBRACK. The Manx or Gaelic name for mackerel.\r\n\r\nBRACKETS.

Ropes passing through leading blocks on the hoops of the\r\nmizen-mast and gaff, and fastened to the outermost leech of the sail, in\r\ndifferent places, to truss it close up as occasion requires; all\r\ntrysails and several of the staysails also have brails.\r\n\r\nBRAIL UP! The order to pull upon the brails, and thereby spill and haul\r\nin the sail. The mizen, or spanker, or driver, or any of the gaff-sails,\r\nas they may be termed, when brailed up, are deemed furled; unless it\r\nblows hard, when they are farther secured by gaskets.\r\n\r\nBRAKE. The handle or lever by which a common ship-pump is usually\r\nworked. It operates by means of two iron bolts, one thrust through the\r\ninner hole of it, which bolted through forms the lever axis in the iron\r\ncrutch of the pump, and serves as the fulcrum for the brake, supporting\r\nit between the cheeks. The other bolt connects the extremity of the\r\nbrake to the pump-spear, which draws up the spear box or piston, charged\r\nwith the water in the tube; derived from _brachium_, an arm or lever.\r\nAlso, used to check the speed of machinery by frictional force pressing\r\non the circumference of the largest wheel acted on by leverage of the\r\nbrake.\r\n\r\nBRAN, TO.

This word was not only used to express courage by our early\r\nseamen, but was also applied to strength; as, \"we had a brave wind.\"\r\n\r\nBRAWET. A kind of eel in the north.\r\n\r\nBRAY, TO. To beat and bruise in a mortar.\r\n\r\nBREACH. Formerly, what is made by the breaking in of the sea, now\r\napplied also to the openings or gaps made in the works of fortified\r\nplaces battered by an enemy's cannon. Also, an old term for a heavy surf\r\nor broken water on a sea-coast; by some called _brist_.\r\n\r\nBREACHING. The act of leaping out of the water; applied to whales.\r\n\r\nBREACH OF THE SEA.

Also,\r\nthose billows which break violently over reefs, rocks, or shallows,\r\nlying immediately at, or under, the surface of the sea. They are\r\ndistinguished both by their appearance and sound, as they cover that\r\npart of the sea with a perpetual foam, and produce loud roaring, very\r\ndifferent from what the waves usually have over a deeper bottom. Also, a\r\nname given to those rocks which occasion the waves to break over\r\nthem.--_Breakers ahead!_ the common pass-word to warn the officer of\r\nbroken water in the direction of the course. (_See also_ SHIP-BREAKER.)\r\n\r\nBREAK-GROUND. Beginning to weigh, or to lift the anchor from the\r\nbottom.

When a ship at anchor is laid in a proper position to\r\nkeep clear of her anchor, but is forced by the wind or current out of\r\nthat position, she is said to break her sheer. Also, for a vessel to\r\nbreak her sheer, or her back, means destroying the gradual sweep\r\nlengthways.\r\n\r\nBREAK-UP, TO. To take a ship to pieces when she becomes old and\r\nunserviceable.\r\n\r\nBREAK-WATER. Any erection or object so placed as to prevent the sea from\r\nrolling inwards. Where there is no mole or jetty the hull of an old ship\r\nmay be sunk at the entrance of a small harbour, to break off or diminish\r\nthe force of the waves as they advance towards the vessels moored\r\nwithin. Every bar to a river or harbour, intended to secure smooth water\r\nwithin, acts as a break-water.\r\n\r\nBREAM.

This operation may be performed either by\r\nlaying the ship aground after the tide has ebbed from her or by docking\r\nor careening.\r\n\r\nBREAST, TO. To run abeam of a cape or object. To cut through a sea, the\r\nsurface of which is poetically termed breast.--_To breast the sea_, to\r\nmeet it by the bow on a wind.--_To breast the surf_, to brave it, and\r\novercome it swimming.--_To breast a bar_, to heave at the capstan.--_To\r\nbreast to_, the act of giving a sheer to a boat.\r\n\r\nBREAST-BACKSTAYS.

A tropical squall.\r\n\r\nBREATH OF WIND. All but a dead calm.\r\n\r\nBREECHING. A strong rope passing through at the cascable of a gun, used\r\nto secure it to the ship's side, and prevent it recoiling too much in\r\ntime of battle, also to secure it when the ship labours; it is fixed by\r\nreeving it through a thimble stropped upon the cascable or knob at the\r\nbreech of the gun; one end is rove and clinched, and the other is\r\npassed through the ring-bolt in the ship's side, and seized back. The\r\nbreeching is of sufficient length to let the muzzle of the cannon come\r\nwithin the ship's side to be charged, or to be housed and lashed.\r\nClinch-shackles have superseded the ring-bolts, so that guns may be\r\ninstantly unshackled and shifted.\r\n\r\nBREECHING-BOLT. Applies to the above.\r\n\r\nBREECH-LOADER. A gun, large or small, charged at the breech. The method\r\nis a very old one revived, but with such scientific modifications as to\r\nhave enormously increased the effectiveness of small-arms; with cannon\r\nits successful practical application to the larger natures has not yet\r\nbeen arrived at, but with field-guns it has added largely to accuracy of\r\npractice and facility of loading.\r\n\r\nBREECH OF A CANNON. The after-end, next the vent or touch-hole. It is\r\nthe most massive part of a gun; strictly speaking, it is all the solid\r\nmetal behind the bottom of the bore. Also, the outside angle formed by\r\nthe knee-timber, the inside of which is the throat.\r\n\r\nBREECH-SIGHT. The notch cut on the base ring of a gun.\r\n\r\nBREEZE.

A shifting wind blowing from sea and land\r\nalternately at certain hours, and sensibly only near the coasts; they\r\nare occasioned by the action of the sun raising the temperature of the\r\nland so as to draw an aerial current from sea-ward by day, which is\r\nreturned as the earth cools at night.\r\n\r\nBREEZE, TO KICK UP A. To excite disturbance, and promote a quarrelsome\r\nrow.\r\n\r\nBREEZING UP. The gale freshening.\r\n\r\nBREEZO.

Military bridges to afford a passage across a river for troops,\r\nare constructed with boats, pontoons, casks, trusses, trestles, &c.\r\nBridge in steam-vessels is the connection between the paddle-boxes, from\r\nwhich the officer in charge directs the motion of the vessel. Also, the\r\nmiddle part of the fire-bars in a marine boiler, on either side of which\r\nthe fires are banked. Also, a narrow ridge of rock, sand, or shingle,\r\nacross the bottom of a channel, so as to occasion a shoal over which the\r\ntide ripples. That between Mount Edgecombe and St. Nicholas' Isle, at\r\nPlymouth, has occasioned much loss of life.\r\n\r\nBRIDGE-ISLET. A portion of land which becomes insular at high-water--as\r\nOld Woman's Isle at Bombay, and among others, the celebrated\r\nLindisfarne, thus _tidally_ sung by Scott:--\r\n\r\n    \"The tide did now his flood-mark gain,\r\n    And girdled in the saint's domain:\r\n    For, with the flow and ebb, its style\r\n    Varies from continent to isle;\r\n    Dry-shod, o'er sands, twice ev'ry day\r\n    The pilgrims to the shrine find way;\r\n    Twice every day the waves efface\r\n    Of staves and sandall'd feet the trace.\"\r\n\r\nBRIDGE-TRAIN.

A\r\ndivision of troops under the command of a general officer. In artillery\r\norganization on land, a brigade is a force usually composed of more than\r\na battery; in the field it commonly consists of two or three batteries;\r\non paper, and for administrative purposes, of eight.\r\n\r\nBRIGADE-MAJOR.

A square-rigged vessel with two masts. A term variously\r\napplied by the mariners of different European nations to a peculiar sort\r\nof vessel of their own marine. Amongst British seamen this vessel is\r\ndistinguished by having her main-sail set nearly in the plane of her\r\nkeel, whereas the main-sails of larger ships are spread athwart the\r\nship's length, and made fast to a yard which hangs parallel to the deck;\r\nbut in a brig, the foremost side of the main-sail is fastened at\r\ndifferent heights to hoops which encircle the main-mast, and slide up\r\nand down it as the sail is hoisted or lowered: it is extended by a gaff\r\nabove and a boom below.

Ropes attached to the foot-ropes of top-sails and courses,\r\nwhich, passing over and before the canvas, turn it up forward, and thus\r\ndisarm the force of the wind; at one-third from each clue, eyelet-holes\r\nare worked in the canvas, and by grummets passed through, a toggle is\r\nsecured on both bights: to this buntline-toggle the buntline attaches by\r\nan eye or loop. When the sails are loosed to dry, the bowlines, unbent\r\nfrom the bridles, are attached to these toggles, and haul out the sails\r\nby the foot-ropes like table-cloths. The buntline is rove through a\r\nblock at the mast-head, passes through the buntline span attached to the\r\ntye-blocks on the yard to retain them in the bunt, or amidships, down\r\nbefore all, and looped to the toggles aforesaid. By aid of the\r\nclue-lines, reef-tackles, and buntlines, a top-sail is taken in or\r\nquieted if the sheets carry away, but more especially by the buntlines,\r\nas the wind has no hold then to belly the canvas.\r\n\r\nBUNTLINE-SPANS. Short pieces of rope with a thimble in one end, the\r\nother whipped; the buntlines are rove through these thimbles: they are\r\nattached to the tie-blocks to keep the sail in the bunt when hauled up.\r\n\r\nBUNTLINE-TOGGLES. _See_ BUNTLINES and TOGGLE.\r\n\r\nBUNT SLAB-LINES. Reeve through a block on the slings of the yard or\r\nunder the top, and pass abaft the sail, making fast to its foot. Their\r\nobject is to lift the foot of a course so as to see underneath it, or to\r\nprevent it from chafing. Something of the same kind is used for\r\ntop-sails, to keep them from rubbing on the stays when flapping in a\r\ncalm.\r\n\r\nBUOY. A sort of close cask, or block of wood, fastened by a rope to the\r\nanchor, to show its situation after being cast, that the ship may not\r\ncome so near it as to entangle her cable about its stock or flukes.--_To\r\nbuoy a cable_ is to make fast a spar, cask, or the like, to the bight of\r\nthe cable, in order to prevent its galling or rubbing on the bottom.\r\nWhen a buoy floats on the water it is said to watch. When a vessel slips\r\nher cable she attaches a buoy to it in order afterwards to recover it.\r\nThus the blockading squadrons off Brest and in Basque Roads frequently\r\nslipped, by signal, and each in beautiful order returned and picked up\r\ntheir cables.--_To stream the buoy_ is to let it fall from the ship's\r\nside into the water, which is always done before the anchor is let go,\r\nthat it may not be fouled by the buoy-rope as it sinks to the\r\nbottom.--_Buoys_ of various kinds are also placed upon rocks or\r\nsand-banks to direct mariners where to avoid danger.\r\n\r\nBUOYANCY. Capacity for floating lightly.--_Centre of buoyancy_, in naval\r\narchitecture, the mean centre of that part of the vessel which is\r\nimmersed in the water. (_See_ CENTRE OF CAVITY.)\r\n\r\nBUOYANT. The property of floating lightly on the water.\r\n\r\nBUOY-ROPE. The rope which attaches the buoy to the anchor, which should\r\nalways be of sufficient strength to lift the anchor should the cable\r\npart; it should also be little more in length than equal to the depth of\r\nthe water (at high-water) where the anchor lies.--_To bend the\r\nbuoy-rope_, pass the running eye over one fluke, take a hitch over the\r\nother arm, and seize. Or, take a clove-hitch over the crown on each arm\r\nor fluke, stopping the end to its own part, or to the shank.\r\n\r\nBUOY-ROPE KNOT. Used where the end is lashed to the shank. A knot made\r\nby unlaying the strands of a cable-laid rope, and also the small strand\r\nof each large strand; and after single and double walling them, as for a\r\nstopper-knot, worm the divisions, and round the rope.\r\n\r\nBURBOT. A fresh-water fish (_Molva lota_) in esteem with fishermen.\r\n\r\nBURDEN. Is the quantity of contents or number of tons weight of goods or\r\nmunitions which a ship will carry, when loaded to a proper sea-trim: and\r\nthis is ascertained by certain fixed rules of measurement. The precise\r\nburden or burthen is about twice the tonnage, but then a vessel would be\r\ndeemed deeply laden.\r\n\r\nBURG [the Anglo-Saxon _burh_]. A word connected with fortification in\r\nGerman, as in almost all the Teutonic languages of Europe. In Arabic the\r\nsame term, with the alteration of a letter, _burj_, signifies primarily\r\na bastion, and by extension any fortified place on a rising ground. This\r\nmeaning has been retained by all northern nations who have borrowed the\r\nword; and we, with the rest, name our towns, once fortified, burghs or\r\nboroughs.\r\n\r\nBURGALL. A fish of the American coasts, from 6 to 12 inches long: it is\r\nalso called the blue-perch, the chogset, and the nibbler--the last from\r\nits habit of nibbling off the bait thrown for other fishes.\r\n\r\nBURGEE. A swallow-tailed or tapered broad pendant; in the merchant\r\nservice it generally has the ship's name on it.\r\n\r\nBURGOMASTER. In the Arctic Sea, a large species of gull (_Larus\r\nglaucus_).\r\n\r\nBURGONET. A steel head-piece, or kind of helmet. Shakspeare makes\r\nCleopatra, alluding to Antony, exclaim--\r\n\r\n    \"The demi-Atlas of this earth, the arm\r\n    And burgonet of men.\"\r\n\r\nIn the second part of \"Henry VI.\" Clifford threatens Warwick--\r\n\r\n    \"And from thy burgonet I'll rend thy bear,\r\n    And tread it underfoot with all contempt.\"\r\n\r\nBURGOO. A seafaring dish made of boiled oatmeal seasoned with salt,\r\nbutter, and sugar. (_See_ LOBLOLLY and SKILLY.)\r\n\r\nBURLEY. The butt-end of a lance.\r\n\r\nBURLEY-TWINE. A strong and coarse twine or small string.\r\n\r\nBURN, OR BOURNE. The Anglo-Saxon term for a small stream or brook,\r\noriginating from springs, and winding through meadows, thus differing\r\nfrom a beck.

A small tackle rove in a particular manner; it is formed by two\r\nblocks or pulleys, with a hook-block in the bight of the running part;\r\nit is generally used to set up or tighten the shrouds, whence it is\r\nfrequently termed a top-burton tackle; but it is equally useful to move\r\nor draw along any weighty body in the hold or on the deck, as anchors,\r\nbales of goods, large casks, &c. (_See_ SPANISH-BURTON.) The burton\r\npurchase, also _runner-purchase_ (which see).\r\n\r\nBUSH, OR BOUCHE. A circular shouldered piece of metal, usually of brass,\r\nlet into the lignum vitae sheaves of such blocks as have iron pins,\r\nthereby preventing the sheave from wearing, without adding much to its\r\nweight. The operation of placing it in the wood is called bushing or\r\ncoaking, though the last name is usually given to smaller bushes of a\r\nsquare shape. Brass bushes are also extensively applied in the marine\r\nsteam-engine work. Also, in artillery, the plug (generally of copper, on\r\naccount of the superior resistance of that metal to the flame of\r\nexploded gunpowder), having a diameter of about an inch, and a length\r\nequal to the intended length of the vent, screwed into the metal of the\r\ngun at the place of the vent, which is then drilled in it.

Also, the opening\r\nbetween the ends of two planks when worked. Also, the extremities of the\r\nplanks themselves when they are united, or abut against each other. The\r\nword likewise is used to denote the largest end of all timber. Planks\r\nunder water as they rise are joined one end to another. In large ships\r\nbutt-ends are most carefully bolted, for if any one of them should\r\nspring, or give way, the leak would be very dangerous and difficult to\r\nstop.--_To start_ or _spring a butt_ is to loosen the end of a plank by\r\nthe ship's weakness or labouring.--_Butt-heads_ are the same with\r\nbutt-ends.--_Butt_ is also a mark for shooting at, and the hind part of\r\na musket or pistol.

The iceberg is formed by the repeated\r\nfreezing of thawed snow running down over the slopes, until at length\r\nthe wave from beneath and weight above causes it to break off and fall\r\ninto the sea, or, as termed in Greenland, to calve. Thus, berg, is\r\nfresh-water ice, the work of years. The floe, is salt water frozen\r\nsuddenly each winter, and dissolving in the summer.\r\n\r\nCALF, OR CALVA.

The part of a dockyard where cambering is performed, and timber\r\nkept. Also, a small dock in the royal yards, for the convenience of\r\nloading and discharging timber. Also, anything that curves upwards.--_To\r\ncamber_, to curve ship-planks.\r\n\r\nCAMBER-KEELED. Keel slightly arched upwards in the middle of the length,\r\nbut not actually hogged.\r\n\r\nCAMBOOSE. A form of _caboose_ (which see).\r\n\r\nCAMELS. All large ships are built, at St. Petersburg, in a dockyard off\r\nthe Granite Quay, where the water is shallow; therefore a number of\r\ncamels or caissons are kept at Cronstadt, for the purpose of carrying\r\nthem down the river. Camels are hollow cases of wood, constructed in two\r\nhalves, so as to embrace the keel, and lay hold of the hull of a ship on\r\nboth sides. They are first filled with water and sunk, in order to be\r\nfixed on. The water is then pumped out, when the vessel gradually rises,\r\nand the process is continued until the ship is enabled to pass over the\r\nshoal. Similar camels were used at Rotterdam about 1690.\r\n\r\nCAME-TO. Brought to an anchor.\r\n\r\nCAMFER. _See_ CHAMFER.\r\n\r\nCAMISADO. A sudden surprise or assault of the enemy.\r\n\r\nCAMOCK.

A barge generally towed by horses, but furnished with a\r\nlarge square-sail for occasional use.\r\n\r\nCAN-BODIES. The old term for anchor-buoys, now can-buoys.\r\n\r\nCAN-BUOYS. Are in the form of a cone, and therefore would countenance\r\nthe term cone-buoys. They are floated over sands and other obstructions\r\nin navigation, as marks to be avoided; they are made very large, to be\r\nseen at a distance; where there are several, they are distinguished by\r\ntheir colour, as black, red, white, or chequered; &c.\r\n\r\nCANCELLED TICKET. One rendered useless by some subsequent arrangement or\r\nclerk's error. In either case the word \"cancelled\" is to be written\r\nacross in large characters, and due record made.

The Crab; the fourth sign of the zodiac, which the sun enters\r\nabout the 21st of June, and commences the summer solstice.\r\n\r\nCANDLE-BARK. A cylindrical tin box for candles.\r\n\r\nCANE. The rattan (_Calamus rudentum_), is extensively used in the East\r\nfor rigging, rope, and cables. The latter have remained for years at the\r\nbottom of the sea uninjured by teredo, or any destructive crustacea. The\r\ncables, too, resist any but the sharpest axes, when used to connect logs\r\nas booms, to stop the navigation of rivers.\r\n\r\nCANEVAS. The old word for hempen canvas; but many races, even the\r\nChinese, make sails entirely of cane. The Americans frequently use\r\ncotton, and term that cloth duck. In the islands of the South Pacific it\r\nis made from the bark of various trees, grasses, &c.\r\n\r\nCAN-HOOKS. They are used to sling a cask by the chimes, or ends of its\r\nstaves, and are formed by reeving the two ends of a piece of rope or\r\nchain through the eyes of two flat hooks, and there making them fast.\r\nThe tackle is then hooked to the middle of the bight.\r\n\r\nCANISTER SHOT. _See_ CASE-SHOT.\r\n\r\nCANNIKIN.

The trunnions,\r\nwhich project on each side, and serve to support the cannon, hold it\r\nalmost in equilibrio. 3d. The bore or caliber, is the interior of the\r\ncylinder, wherein the powder and shot are lodged when the cannon is\r\nloaded. The entrance of the bore is called the mouth or muzzle.

An old name for a gun of 7-inches bore.\r\n\r\nCANOE. A peculiar boat used by several uncivilized nations, formed of\r\nthe trunk of a tree hollowed out, and sometimes of several pieces of\r\nbark joined together, and again of hide. They are of various sizes,\r\naccording to the uses for which they are designed, or the countries to\r\nwhich they belong. Some carry sail, but they are commonly rowed with\r\npaddles, somewhat resembling a corn-shovel; and instead of rowing with\r\nit horizontally, as with an oar, they manage it perpendicularly. In\r\nGreenland and Hudson Bay, the Esquimaux limits of America, skin-boats\r\nare chiefly in use, under the name of kaiack, oomiak, baidar, &c.\r\n\r\nCANOPUS. The lucida of Argo Navis, and a Greenwich star. Also, a city of\r\nclassical importance, visited by the heroes of the Trojan war, the\r\nreputed burial-place of the pilot of Menelaus, &c. But, as some ancient\r\nplaces have been so fortunate as to renew their classical importance in\r\nmodern times, so this, under the modern name of Abukeir, has received a\r\nnew \"stamp of fate,\" by its overlooking, like Salamis, the scene of a\r\nnaval battle, which also led to a decision of the fate of nations. In\r\nthis bay Nelson, at one blow, destroyed the fleet of the enemy, and cut\r\noff the veteran army of France from the shores of Egypt. The Canopian\r\nmouth of the Nile was the most westerly of all the branches of that\r\ncelebrated river.\r\n\r\nCANOPY. A light awning over the stern-sheets of a boat.\r\n\r\nCANT, TO.

Those ribbons that do not lie in a horizontal or level\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nCANT-ROPE. _See_ FOUR-CANT.\r\n\r\nCANT-SPAR. A hand-mast pole, fit for making small masts or yards, booms,\r\n&c.\r\n\r\nCANT-TIMBERS. They derive their name from being canted or raised\r\nobliquely from the keel. The upper ends of those on the bow are inclined\r\nto the stem, as those in the after-part incline to the stern-post above.\r\nIn a word, cant-timbers are those which do not stand square with the\r\nmiddle line of the ship. They may be deemed radial bow or stern-timbers.\r\n\r\nCANVAS [from _cannabis_, hemp]. A cloth made of hemp, and used for the\r\nsails of ships. It is purchased in bolts, and numbered from 1 to 8,\r\nrarely to 9 and 10. Number 1 being the coarsest and strongest, is used\r\nfor the lower sails, as fore-sail and main-sail in large ships. When a\r\nvessel is in motion by means of her sails she is said to be under\r\ncanvas.\r\n\r\nCANVAS-BACK DUCK. An American wild duck (_Fuligula valisneria_), which\r\ntakes this name from the colour of the back feathers; much esteemed as a\r\ndelicacy.\r\n\r\nCANVAS-CLIMBER. A word used by Marston for a sailor who goes aloft;\r\nhence Marina tells Leonine--\r\n\r\n    \"And, clasping to a mast, endur'd a sea\r\n    That almost burst the deck, and from the ladder-tackle\r\n    Wash'd off a canvas-climber.\"\r\n\r\nCAP. A strong thick block of wood having two large holes through it, the\r\none square, the other round, used to confine two masts together, when\r\none is erected at the head of the other, in order to lengthen it. The\r\nprincipal caps of a ship are those of the lower masts, which are fitted\r\nwith a strong eye-bolt on each side, wherein to hook the block by which\r\nthe top-mast is drawn up through the cap. In the same manner as the top\r\nmast slides up through the cap of the lower mast, the topgallant-mast\r\nslides up through the cap of the top-masts. When made of iron the cap\r\nused to be called a crance.--_To cap_ a mast-head is placing tarpaulin\r\nguards against weather. The term is applied to any covering such as lead\r\nput over iron bolts to prevent corrosion by sea-water, canvas covers\r\nover the ends of rigging, &c. &c. Also, pieces of oak laid on the upper\r\nblocks on which a vessel is built, to receive the keel. They are split\r\nout for the addition of the false keel, and therefore should be of the\r\nmost free-grained timber. Also, the coating which guards the top of a\r\nquill tube. Also, the percussion priming for fire-arms.--_Cap-a-pied_,\r\narmed from head to foot.\r\n\r\nCAP, TO. To puzzle or beat in argument. To salute by touching the\r\nhead-covering, as Shakspeare makes Iago's friends act to Othello. It is\r\nnow more an academic than a sea-term.\r\n\r\nCAPABARRE. An old term for misappropriating government stores. (_See_\r\nMarryat's _Novels_.)\r\n\r\nCAPACISE. A corrupt form of _capsize_.\r\n\r\nCAPACITY. Burden, tonnage, fitness for the service, rating.\r\n\r\nCAPE. A projecting point of land jutting out from the coast-line; the\r\nextremity of a promontory, of which last it is the secondary rank. It\r\ndiffers from a headland, since a cape may be low. The Cape of Good Hope\r\nis always familiarly known as \"The Cape.\" _Cape_ was also used for a\r\nrhumb-line.\r\n\r\nCAPE, TO. To keep a course. How does she cape? how does she lie her\r\ncourse?\r\n\r\nCAPE FLY-AWAY. A cloud-bank on the horizon, mistaken for land, which\r\ndisappears as the ship advances. (_See_ FOG.)\r\n\r\nCAPE-HEN. _See_ MOLLY-MAWK.\r\n\r\nCAPELLA. The lucida of Auriga, and a nautical star.\r\n\r\nCAPE-MERCHANT [_capo_]. An old name for super-cargo in early voyages, as\r\nalso the head merchant in a factory.\r\n\r\nCAPE-PIGEON, OR CAPE-PETREL. A sea-bird which follows a ship in her\r\npassage round the cape; the _Procellaria capensis_. (_See_ PINTADOS.)\r\n\r\nCAPER. A light-armed vessel of the 17th century, used by the Dutch for\r\nprivateering.\r\n\r\nCAPER CORNER-WAY. Diagonally.\r\n\r\nCAPFUL OF WIND.

The way in which some address the commanders of merchant vessels.\r\n\r\nCAPON. A jeering name for the red-herring.\r\n\r\nCAPONNIERE. In fortification, a passage across the bottom of the ditch,\r\ncovered, at the least, by a parapet on each side, and very generally\r\nalso with a bomb-proof roof, when it may be furnished with many guns,\r\nwhich are of great importance in the defence of a fortress, as the\r\nbesieger can hardly silence them till he has constructed batteries on\r\nthe brink of the ditch.\r\n\r\nCAPOTE. A good storm-coat with a hood, much worn in the Levant, and made\r\nof a special manufacture.\r\n\r\nCAPPANUS. The worm which adheres to, and gnaws the bottom of a ship, to\r\nprevent which all ships should be sheathed with copper.\r\n\r\nCAPPED.

The clamp of iron which shuts over the trunnions of a gun to\r\nsecure them to the carriage, having a curve to receive one-third part of\r\nthe trunnion, the other two being sunk in the carriage; it is closed by\r\nforelocks.\r\n\r\nCAPSTAN, CABESTAN, CAPSTERN, CAPSTON, &c. A mechanical arrangement for\r\nlifting great weights. There is a variety of capsterns, but they agree\r\nin having a horizontal circular head, which has square holes around its\r\nedge, and in these long bars are shipped, and are said to be \"swifted\"\r\nwhen their outer ends are traced together; beneath is a perpendicular\r\nbarrel, round which is wrapped the rope or chain used to lift the anchor\r\nor other great weight, even to the heaving a ship off a shoal. Now, in\r\nmost ships where a capstern is used to lift the anchor, the chain cable\r\nis itself brought to the capstern. The purchase or lifting power is\r\ngained by the great sweep of the bars. A perpendicular iron spindle\r\npasses through the whole capstern, and is stepped into a socket on the\r\ndeck below the one on which it stands. In some cases capsterns are\r\ndouble in height, so that bars may be worked on two decks, giving more\r\nroom for the men.\r\n\r\nCAPSTAN, TO COME UP THE. In one sense is to lift the pauls and walk\r\nback, or turn the capstan the contrary way, thereby slackening, or\r\nletting out some of the rope on which they have been heaving. The sudden\r\norder would be obeyed by surging, or letting go any rope on which they\r\nwere heaving. Synonymous to \"Come up the purchase.\"\r\n\r\nCAPSTAN, TO HEAVE AT THE. To urge it round, by pushing against the bars,\r\nas already described.\r\n\r\nCAPSTAN, TO MAN THE. To place the sailors at it in readiness to heave.\r\n\r\nCAPSTAN, TO PAUL THE. To drop all the pauls into their sockets, to\r\nprevent the capstan from recoiling during any pause of heaving.\r\n\r\nCAPSTAN, TO RIG THE. To fix the bars in their respective holes, thrust\r\nin the pins to confine them, and reeve the swifter through the ends.\r\n\r\nCAPSTAN, SURGE THE. Is the order to slacken the rope which is wound\r\nround the barrel while heaving, to prevent it from riding or fouling.\r\nThis term specially applies to surging the messenger when it rides, or\r\nwhen the two lashing eyes foul on the whelps or the barrel.\r\n\r\nCAPSTAN-BAR PINS. Pins inserted through their ends to prevent their\r\nunshipping.\r\n\r\nCAPSTAN-BARRING. An obsolete sea-punishment, in which the offender was\r\nsentenced to carry a capstan-bar during a watch.\r\n\r\nCAPSTAN-BARS. Long pieces of wood of the best ash or hickory, one end of\r\nwhich is thrust into the square holes in the drumhead, like the spokes\r\nof a wheel. They are used to heave the capstan round, by the men setting\r\ntheir hands and chests against them, and walking round. They are also\r\nheld in their places in the drumhead holes, by little iron bolts called\r\ncapstan or safety pins, to prevent their flying out when the surging\r\novercomes the force of the men. Many men have been killed by this\r\naction, and more by the omission to \"pin and swift.\"\r\n\r\nCAPSTAN-ROOM. _See_ ROOM.\r\n\r\nCAPSTAN-STEP. (_See_ STEP OF THE CAPSTAN.) The men march round to the\r\ntune of a fiddle or fife, and the phrase of excitement is, \"Step out,\r\nlads, make your feet tell.\"\r\n\r\nCAPSTAN-SWIFTER. A rope passed horizontally through notches in the outer\r\nends of the bars, and drawn very tight: the intent is to steady the men\r\nas they walk round when the ship rolls, and to give room for a greater\r\nnumber to assist, by manning the swifters both within and without.\r\n\r\nCAPTAIN. This title is said to be derived from the eastern military\r\nmagistrate _katapan_, meaning \"over everything;\" but the term _capitano_\r\nwas in use among the Italians nearly 200 years before Basilius II.\r\nappointed his katapan of Apulia and Calabria, A.D. 984. Hence, the\r\ncorruption of the Apulian province into _capitanata_. Among the\r\nAnglo-Saxons the captain was _schipp-hlaford_, or ship's lord. The\r\ncaptain, strictly speaking, is the officer commanding a line-of-battle\r\nship, or a frigate carrying twenty or more cannon. A captain in the\r\nroyal navy is answerable for any bad conduct in the military government,\r\nnavigation, and equipment of his ship; also for any neglect of duty in\r\nhis inferior officers, whose several charges he is appointed to\r\nregulate. It is also a title, though incorrectly, given to the masters\r\nof all vessels whatever, they having no commissions. It is also applied\r\nin the navy itself to the chief sailor of particular gangs of men; in\r\nrank, captain of the forecastle, admiral's coxswain, captain's\r\ncoxswain, captain of the hold, captain of main-top, captain of fore-top,\r\n&c.\r\n\r\nCAPTAIN. A name given to the crooner, crowner, or gray gurnard (_Trigla\r\ngurnardus_).\r\n\r\nCAPTAIN OF A MERCHANT SHIP. Is a certificated officer in the mercantile\r\nmarine, intrusted with the entire charge of a ship, both as regards life\r\nand property. He is in no way invested with special powers to meet his\r\npeculiar circumstances, but has chiefly to depend upon moral influence\r\nfor maintaining order amongst his passengers and crew during the many\r\nweeks or even months that he is cut off from appeal to the laws of his\r\ncountry, only resorting to force on extreme occasions. Great tact and\r\njudgment is required to fulfil this duty properly.\r\n\r\nCAPTAIN OF A SHIP OF WAR. Is the commanding officer; as well the\r\npost-captain (a title now disused) as those whose proper title is\r\ncommander.\r\n\r\nCAPTAIN OF THE FLEET. Is a temporary admiralty appointment; he is\r\nentitled to be considered as a flag-officer, and to a share in the\r\nprize-money accordingly. He carries out all orders issued by the\r\ncommander-in-chief, but his special duty is to keep up the discipline of\r\nthe fleet, in which he is supreme. He is the adjutant-general of the\r\nforce, hoisting the flag and wearing the uniform of rear-admiral.\r\n\r\nCAPTAIN OF THE HEAD. Not a recognized rating, but an ordinary man\r\nappointed to attend to the swabs, and to keep the ship's head clean.\r\n\r\nCAPTAIN OF THE HOLD. The last of the captains in rank, as a first-class\r\npetty officer.\r\n\r\nCAPTAIN OF THE PORT. The captain of the port is probably better\r\nexplained by referring to that situation at Gibraltar. He belongs to the\r\nBoard of Health; he controls the entries and departures, the berthing at\r\nthe anchorage, and general marine duties, but possesses no naval\r\nauthority. Hence, the port-captain is quite another officer. (_See_\r\nPORT-CAPTAIN.)\r\n\r\nCAPTAIN-GENERAL. The highest army rank.\r\n\r\nCAPTAIN'S CLERK. One whose duty is strictly to keep all books and\r\nofficial papers necessary for passing the captain's accounts at the\r\nadmiralty.\r\n\r\nCAPTAIN'S CLOAK.

A place of reserve on the platform deck, for the\r\ncaptain's wines and sea-stores.\r\n\r\nCAPTIVE. A prisoner of war.\r\n\r\nCAPTORS. The conquerors of and sharers in the proceeds of a prize.\r\nCaptors are not at liberty to release prisoners belonging to the ships\r\nof the enemy. The last survivor is in law the only captor.\r\n\r\nCAPTURE. A prize taken by a ship of war at sea; is the taking forcible\r\npossession of vessels or goods belonging to one nation by those of a\r\nhostile nation. Vessels are looked on as prizes if they fight under any\r\nother standard than that of the state from which they have their\r\ncommission; if they have no charty-party, manifest, or bill of lading,\r\nor if loaded with effects belonging to the king's enemies, or even\r\ncontraband goods. Whether the capture be lawful or unlawful, the insurer\r\nis rendered liable to the loss.\r\n\r\nCAR. A north-country word, denoting any swampy land surrounded by\r\ninclosures, and occasionally under water.\r\n\r\nCARABINEER. One who uses the carbine.\r\n\r\nCARACK, CARRAK, OR CARRICK.

Hippus, the Tyrian, is said to have first devised\r\ncaracks, and onerary vessels of prodigious bulk for traffic or offence.\r\n\r\nCARACORA. A proa of Borneo, Ternate, and the Eastern Isles; also called\r\ncaracol by early voyagers.\r\n\r\nCARAMOUSSAL. A Turkish merchant ship with a pink-stern.\r\n\r\nCARAVEL, OR CARAVELA. A Portuguese despatch boat, lateen-rigged,\r\nformerly in use; it had square sails only on the fore-mast, though\r\ndignified as a caravela.\r\n\r\nCARAVELAO. A light pink-sterned vessel of the Azores.\r\n\r\nCARBASSE. _See_ KARBATZ.\r\n\r\nCARBIN. A name in our northern isles for the basking shark.\r\n\r\nCARBINE, OR CARABINE. A fire-arm of less length and weight than a\r\nmusket, originally carrying a smaller ball, though latterly, for the\r\nconvenience of the supply of ammunition, throwing the same bullet as the\r\nmusket, though with a smaller charge. It has been proper to mounted\r\ntroops since about A.D. 1556, and has been preferred to the musket as a\r\nweapon for the tops of ships as well as boats.\r\n\r\nCARCASS. An iron shell for incendiary purposes, filled with a very\r\nfiercely flaming composition of saltpetre, sulphur, resin, turpentine,\r\nantimony, and tallow. It has three vents for the flame, and sometimes is\r\nequipped with pistol barrels, so fitted in its interior as to discharge\r\ntheir bullets at various times.\r\n\r\nCARCASS OF A SHIP. The ribs, with keel, stem, and stern-post, after the\r\nplanks are stripped off.\r\n\r\nCARCATUS [from _caricato_, It.] A law-term for a freighted ship.\r\n\r\nCARD.

The zodiacal signs which the sun enters at the equinoxes\r\nand solstices.\r\n\r\nCARDINAL WINDS. Those from the due north, east, south, and west points\r\nof the compass.\r\n\r\nCAREEN, TO. A ship is said to careen when she inclines to one side, or\r\nlies over when sailing on a wind; off her keel or carina.\r\n\r\nCAREENING. The operation of heaving the ship down on one side, by\r\narranging the ballast, or the application of a strong purchase to her\r\nmasts, which require to be expressly supported for the occasion to\r\nprevent their springing; by these means one side of the bottom, elevated\r\nabove the surface of the water, may be cleansed or repaired.

The hind axle-tree takes, with the intervention of\r\nvarious elevating arrangements, the preponderance of the breech. The\r\nsecond kind is adapted for field and siege work: the shallow brackets\r\nare raised in front on high wheels, but unite behind into a solid beam\r\ncalled the trail, which tapers downwards, and rests on the ground when\r\nin action, but for travel is connected to a two-wheeled carriage called\r\na _limber_ (which see). Gun-carriages are chiefly made of elm for\r\nship-board, as less given to splinter from shot, and of oak on shore;\r\nwrought-iron, however, is being applied for the carriages of the large\r\nguns recently introduced, and even cast-iron is economically used in\r\nsome fortresses little liable to sudden counter-battery.\r\n\r\nCARRICK.

Composed of two wide balks of elm on which the\r\ncarronade carriage slides. As the slide is bolted to the ship's side,\r\nand is a radius from that bolt or pivot, carronades were once the only\r\nguns which could be truly concentrated on a given object.\r\n\r\nCARRY, TO.

Their length is from 20 to 25 feet, and breadth 2-1/2 to\r\n3-1/2 feet, secured together by means of three spreaders and cross\r\nlashings, through small holes; the centre log is much the largest, with\r\na curved surface at the fore-end, which tends and finishes upwards to a\r\npoint. The side logs are very similar in form, and fitted to the centre\r\nlog. These floats are navigated with great skill by one or two men, in a\r\nkneeling position; they think nothing of passing through the surf which\r\nlashes the beach at Madras and at other parts of these coasts, when even\r\nthe boats of the country could not live upon the waves; they are also\r\npropelled out to the shipping at anchor when boats of the best\r\nconstruction and form would be swamped. In the monsoons, when a sail can\r\nbe got on them, a small out-rigger is placed at the end of two poles, as\r\na balance, with a bamboo mast and yard, and a mat or cotton-cloth sail,\r\nall three parts of which are connected; and when the tack and sheet of\r\nthe sail are let go, it all falls fore and aft alongside, and being\r\nlight, is easily managed. In carrying a press of sail, they are trimmed\r\nby the balance-lever, by going out on the poles so as to keep the log\r\non the surface of the water, and not impede its velocity, which, in a\r\nstrong wind, is very great.\r\n\r\nCATANADROMI.

They keep the shrouds taut for the better ease and safety\r\nof the mast.\r\n\r\nCAT-HEAD. The cat-head passes through the bow-bulwark obliquely forward\r\non a radial line from the fore-mast, rests on the timbers even with the\r\nwater-way, passes through the deck, and is secured to the side-timbers.\r\nIt is selected from curved timber. Its upper head is on a level with the\r\nupper rail; it is furnished with three great sheaves, and externally\r\nstrengthened by a cat-head knee. It not only is used to lift the anchor\r\nfrom the surface of the water, but as it \"looks forward,\" the cat-block\r\nis frequently lashed to the cable to aid by its powerful purchase when\r\nthe capstan fails to make an impression. The cat-fall rove through the\r\nsheaves, and the cat-block furnish the cat-purchase. The cat-head thus\r\nserves to suspend the anchor clear of the bow, when it is necessary to\r\nlet it go: the knee by which it is supported is generally ornamented\r\nwith carving. Termed also _cat-head bracket_.\r\n\r\nCAT-HOLES. Places or spaces made in the quarter, for carrying out fasts\r\nor springs for steadying or heaving astern.\r\n\r\nCAT-HOOK.

It allows one sail only--an\r\nenormous fore-and-aft main-sail, spread by a gaff at the head and a boom\r\nat the foot, hoisted on a stout mast, which is stepped close to the\r\nstem.\r\n\r\nCAT-ROPE. A line for hauling the cat-hook about: also cat-back-rope,\r\nwhich hauls the block to the ring of the anchor in order to hook it.\r\n\r\nCAT'S-PAW. A light air perceived at a distance in a calm, by the\r\nimpressions made on the surface of the sea, which it sweeps very gently,\r\nand then passes away, being equally partial and transitory. Old\r\nsuperstitious seamen are seen to scratch the backstays with their nails,\r\nand whistle to invoke even these cat's-paws, the general forerunner of\r\nthe steadier breeze. Cat's-paw is also a name given to a particular\r\ntwisting hitch, made in the bight of a rope, so as to induce two small\r\nbights, in order to hook a tackle on them both.

A strong tackle, used to draw the anchor perpendicularly up\r\nto the cat-head, which latter is sometimes called cat.\r\n\r\nCATTAN. _See_ KATAN.\r\n\r\nCAT THE ANCHOR. When the cat is hooked and \"cable enough\" veered and\r\nstoppered, the anchor hangs below the cat-head, swings beneath it; it is\r\nthen hauled close up to the cat-head by the purchase called the\r\ncat-fall. The cat-stopper is then passed, and the cat-block unhooked.\r\n\r\nCATTING. The act of heaving the anchor by the cat-tackle. Also,\r\nsea-sickness.\r\n\r\nCATTY. A Chinese commercial weight of 18 ozs. English. Tea is packed in\r\none or two or more catty boxes, hence most likely our word tea-caddy.\r\n\r\nCAUDAL FIN.

After\r\nthe oakum is driven in very hard, hot melted pitch or rosin is poured\r\ninto the groove, to keep the water from rotting it. Among the ancients\r\nthe first who made use of pitch in caulking were the inhabitants of\r\nPhaeacia, afterwards called Corfu. Wax and rosin appear to have been\r\ncommonly used before that period; and the Poles still substitute an\r\nunctuous clay for the same purpose for the vessels on their navigable\r\nrivers.\r\n\r\nCAULKING-BUTT. The opening between ends or joints of the planks when\r\nworked for caulking.\r\n\r\nCAULKING-IRONS.

They are formed to\r\nproject the chain-plate, and give the lower rigging greater out-rig or\r\nspread, free from the top-sides of the ship, thus affording greater\r\nsecurity and support to the masts, as well as to prevent the shrouds\r\nfrom damaging the gunwale, or being hurt by rubbing against it. Of\r\ncourse they are respectively designated fore, main, and mizen. They are\r\nnow discontinued in many ships, the eyes being secured to the\r\ntimber-heads, and frequently within the gunwale to the stringers or\r\nlower shelf-pieces above the water-way.--_In the chains_, applies to the\r\nleadsman who stands on the channels between two shrouds to heave the\r\nhand-lead.\r\n\r\nCHAIN-SHOT.

The end of the bore modified to receive\r\nthe charge of powder. In mortars, howitzers, and shell-guns, they are of\r\nsmaller diameter than the bore, for the charges being comparatively\r\nsmall, more effect is thus expected. The gomer chamber (which see) is\r\ngenerally adopted in our service. In rifled guns the powder-chamber is\r\nnot rifled; it and the bullet-chamber differ in other minute respects\r\nfrom the rest of the bore. Patereroes for festive occasions are\r\nsometimes called chambers; as the small mortars, formerly used for\r\nfiring salutes in the parks, termed also pint-pots from their shape and\r\nhandles.\r\n\r\nCHAMBERS.

The order to the helmsman to steer the ship on the course\r\nindicated, and not closer to the wind, while going \"full and by.\"--_Come\r\non board, sir._ An officer reporting himself to his superior on\r\nreturning from duty or leave.--_Come to._ To bring the ship close to the\r\nwind.--_Come to an anchor._ To let go the anchor.--_Come up!_ with a\r\nrope or tackle, is to slack it off.--_Comes up_, with the helm. A\r\nclose-hauled ship comes up (to her course) as the wind changes in her\r\nfavour. To _come up with_ or overhaul a vessel chased.--_Come up the\r\ncapstan._ Is to turn it the contrary way to that which it was heaving,\r\nso as to take the strain off, or slacken or let out some of the cablet\r\nor rope which is about it.--_Come up the tackle-fall._ Is to let\r\ngo.--_To come up_, in ship-building, is to cast loose the forelocks or\r\nlashings of a sett, in order to take in closer to the plank.\r\n\r\nCOMING-HOME. Said of the anchor when it has been dropped on bad holding\r\nground, or is dislodged from its bed by the violence of the wind and\r\nsea, and is dragged along by the vessel, or is tripped by insufficient\r\nlength of cable.--_Coming round on her heel._ Turning in the same\r\nspot.--_Coming the old soldier._ Petty man[oe]uvring.--_Coming-up\r\nglass._ (_See_ DOUBLE-IMAGE MICROMETER.)\r\n\r\nCOMITY. A certain _comitas gentium_, or judgment of tribunals, having\r\ncompetent jurisdiction in any one state, are regarded in the courts of\r\nall other civilized powers as conclusive. Especially binding in all\r\nprize matters, however manifestly unjust may be the decision. (_See_\r\nJUDGMENT.)\r\n\r\nCOMMAND. The words of command are the terms used by officers in exercise\r\nor upon service. All commands belong to the senior officer. Also, in\r\nfortification, the height of the top of the parapet of a work above the\r\nlevel of the country, or above that of another work. Generally, one\r\nposition is said to be commanded by another when it can be seen into\r\nfrom the latter.\r\n\r\nCOMMANDANT. The officer in command of a squadron, ship, garrison, fort,\r\nor regiment.\r\n\r\nCOMMANDER. An officer in the royal navy, commanding a ship of war of\r\nunder twenty guns, a sloop of war, armed ship, or bomb-vessel. He was\r\nentitled master and commander, and ranked with a major of the army: now\r\nsimply termed commander, and ranking with lieutenant-colonel, but junior\r\nof that rank. The act of the commander is binding upon the interests of\r\nall under him, and he is alone responsible for costs and damages: he may\r\nact erroneously, and abandon what might have turned out good prize to\r\nhimself and crew.--_Commander_ is also the name of a large wooden mallet\r\nused specially in the sail and rigging lofts, as anything of metal would\r\ninjure the ropes or canvas.\r\n\r\nCOMMANDER-IN-CHIEF. The senior officer in any port or station appointed\r\nto hold command over all other vessels within the limits assigned to\r\nhim. Thus the commodore on the coast of Africa is, _de facto_,\r\ncommander-in-chief, free from the interference of any other authority\r\nafloat.\r\n\r\nCOMMAND-OF-MIND MEN. Steady officers, who command coolly.\r\n\r\nCOMMEATUS, OR PROVISIONS, going to the enemy's ports, subject only to\r\n_pre_-emption, a right of purchase upon reasonable terms, but previously\r\nliable to confiscation (Robinson). _Commeatus_, in admiralty law, is a\r\ngeneral term, signifying drink as well as eatables.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCE. Was not much practised by the Romans. The principal objects of\r\ntheir water-carriage were the supply of corn, still termed _annona_, and\r\nthe tribute and spoils of conquered countries.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL CODE OF SIGNALS. As Marryat's and others.\r\n\r\nCOMMISSARIAT. The department of supplies to the army.\r\n\r\nCOMMISSARY. The principal officer in charge of the commissariat.\r\n\r\nCOMMISSION. The authority by which an officer officiates in his post.\r\nAlso, an allowance paid to agents or factors for transacting the\r\nbusiness of others.\r\n\r\nCOMMISSIONED OFFICERS. Those appointed by commissions. Such are\r\nadmirals, down to lieutenants, in the royal navy; and in the army, all\r\nfrom the general to the ensign inclusive.\r\n\r\nCOMMISSIONERS, LORDS, OF THE ADMIRALTY. In general the crown appoints\r\nfive or seven commissioners for executing the office of lord\r\nhigh-admiral, &c.; for this important and high office has seldom been\r\nintrusted to any single person. The admiralty jurisdiction extends to\r\nall offences mentioned in the articles of war, or new naval code, as\r\nregards places beyond the powers of the law courts, or outside the\r\nbounds of a county. But all criminal acts committed within the limits of\r\na county, or within a line drawn from one headland to the next, are\r\nspecially liable to be tried by the common law courts. The high court of\r\nadmiralty civil court takes cognizance of salvage, prize-derelict,\r\ncollision, &c., at sea beyond the county limits, even as relates to\r\nships of war if in fault.\r\n\r\nCOMMISSIONERS OF CUSTOMS. The board of management of the customs\r\ndepartment of the public revenue.\r\n\r\nCOMMISSIONERS OF THE NAVY. Certain officers formerly appointed to\r\nsuperintend the affairs of the navy, under the direction of the\r\nlords-commissioners of the Admiralty. Their duty was more immediately\r\nconcerned in the building, docking, and repairing of ships in the\r\ndockyards; they had also the appointment of some of the officers, as\r\nsurgeons, masters, &c., and the transport, victualling, and medical\r\ndepartments were controlled by that board. It was abolished in 1831.\r\n\r\nCOMMIT ONE'S SELF, TO. To break through regulations. To incur\r\nresponsibility without regard to results.\r\n\r\nCOMMODORE. A senior officer in command of a detached squadron. A captain\r\nfinding five or six ships assembled, was formerly permitted to hoist his\r\npennant, and command as commodore; and a necessity arising for holding a\r\ncourt-martial, he ordered the said court to assemble. Again, where an\r\nadmiral dies in command, the senior captain hoists a first-class broad\r\npennant, and appoints a captain, secretary, and flag-lieutenant, fulfils\r\nthe duties of a rear-admiral, and wears the uniform. Commodores of the\r\nsecond class have no captain or pennant-lieutenant. A commodore rates\r\nwith brigadier-generals, according to dates of commission (being of full\r\ncolonel's rank). He is next in command to a rear-admiral, but cannot\r\nhoist his broad pennant in the presence of an admiral, or superior\r\ncaptain, without permission. The broad pennant is a swallow-tailed\r\ntapered burgee. The second-class commodore is to hoist his broad\r\npennant, white at the fore. It is a title given by courtesy to the\r\nsenior captain, where three or more ships of war are cruising in\r\ncompany. It was also imported into the East India Company's vessels, the\r\nsenior being so termed, _inter se_. It moreover denotes the convoy ship,\r\nwhich carries a light in her top. The epithet is corrupted from the\r\nSpanish _comendador_.\r\n\r\nCOMMUNICATION. Corresponding by letter, hail, or signal. (_See_ LINE OF\r\nCOMMUNICATION and BOYAUX.)\r\n\r\nCOMMUTE, TO. To lighten the sentence of a court-martial, on a\r\nrecommendation of the court to the commander-in-chief.\r\n\r\nCOMPANION. The framing and sash-lights upon the quarter-deck or\r\nround-house, through which light passes to the cabins and decks below;\r\nand a sort of wooden hood placed over the entrance or staircase of the\r\nmaster's cabin in small ships. Flush-decked vessels are generally fitted\r\nwith movable companions, to keep the rain or water from descending,\r\nwhich are unshipped when the capstan is required.\r\n\r\nCOMPANION-LADDER. Denotes the ladder by which the officers ascend to,\r\nand descend from, the quarter-deck.\r\n\r\nCOMPANION-WAY. The staircase, porch, or berthing of the ladder-way to\r\nthe cabin.\r\n\r\nCOMPANY. The whole crew of any ship, including her officers, men, and\r\nboys. In the army, a small body of foot, or subdivision of a regiment,\r\ncommanded by a captain.\r\n\r\nCOMPARATIVE RANK. _See_ RANK.\r\n\r\nCOMPARISON WATCH. The job-watch for taking an observation, compared\r\nbefore and after with the chronometer.\r\n\r\nCOMPARTMENT BULK-HEADS. Some of the iron ships have adopted the\r\nadmirable Chinese plan of dividing the hold athwart-ship by strong\r\nwater-tight bulk-heads, into compartments, so that a leak in any one of\r\nthem does not communicate with the others--thus strengthening a vessel,\r\nbesides adding to its security. Compartment bulk-heads were first\r\ndirected to be fitted under the superintendence of Commander Belcher in\r\nH.M. ships _Erebus_ and _Terror_ at Chatham, for Arctic service in 1835.\r\nH.M.S. _Terror_, Commander Back, was saved entirely owing to this\r\nfitment, the after section being full of water all the passage home; and\r\nlately the mail packet _Samphire_ was similarly saved.\r\n\r\nCOMPASANT. A corruption of _corpo santo_, a ball of electric light\r\nobserved flickering about the masts, yard-arms, and rigging, during\r\nheavy rain, thunder, and lightning.\r\n\r\nCOMPASS. An instrument employed by navigators to guide the ship's course\r\nat sea. It consists of a circular box, containing a fly or paper card,\r\nwhich represents the horizon, and is suspended by two concentric rings\r\ncalled gimbals. The fly is divided into thirty-two equal parts, by lines\r\ndrawn from the centre to the circumference, called points or rhumbs; the\r\ninterval between the points is subdivided into 360 degrees--consequently,\r\nthe distance or angle comprehended between any two rhumbs is equal to 11\r\ndegrees and 15 minutes. The four cardinal points lie opposite to each\r\nother; the north and south points form top and bottom, leaving the east\r\non the right hand, and the west on the left; the names of all the\r\ninferior points are compounded of these according to their situation.\r\nThis card is attached to a magnetic needle, which, carrying the card\r\nround with it, points north, excepting for the local annual variation\r\nand the deviation caused by the iron in the ship; the angle which the\r\ncourse makes with that meridian is shown by the lubber's point, a dark\r\nline inside the box. (_See_ ADJUSTMENT OF THE COMPASS.)\r\n\r\nCOMPASS, TO. To curve; also to obtain one's object.\r\n\r\nCOMPASSING. (_See_ COMPASS-TIMBERS.)\r\n\r\nCOMPASSIONATE ALLOWANCES. Grants are made on the compassionate fund to\r\nthe legitimate children of deceased officers, on its being shown to the\r\nAdmiralty that they deserve them.\r\n\r\nCOMPASS-SAW. A narrow saw, which, inserted in a hole bored by a\r\ncentre-bit, follows out required curves.\r\n\r\nCOMPASS-TIMBERS. Such as are curved, crooked, or arched, for\r\nship-building.\r\n\r\nCOMPENSATION. If a detained vessel is lost by the negligence and\r\nmisconduct of the prize-master, compensation must be rendered, and the\r\nactual captors are responsible. The principal being answerable in law\r\nfor the agent's acts.\r\n\r\nCOMPENSATOR OF THE COMPASS. _See_ MAGNETIC COMPENSATOR.\r\n\r\nCOMPLAIN, TO. The creaking of masts, or timbers, when over-pressed,\r\nwithout any apparent external defect. One man threatening to complain of\r\nanother, is saying that he will report misconduct to the officer in\r\ncharge of the quarter-deck.\r\n\r\nCOMPLEMENT. The proper number of men employed in any ship, either for\r\nnavigation or battle. In navigation the complement of the course is what\r\nit wants of eight points; of latitude, what it is short of 90 deg.\r\n(_See_ CO-LATITUDE.)\r\n\r\nCOMPLEMENT OF LONGITUDE. _See_ SUPPLEMENT OF LONGITUDE.\r\n\r\nCOMPLETE BOOK. A book which contains the names and particulars of every\r\nperson borne for wages on board, as age, place of birth, rating, times\r\nof entry and discharge, &c.\r\n\r\nCOMPLIMENT, TO.

A pad of soft linen used by the surgeon for the dressing of a\r\nwound.\r\n\r\nCOMPRESSION OF THE POLES. The amount of flattening at the polar regions\r\nof a planet, by which the polar diameter is less than the equatorial.\r\n\r\nCOMPRESSOR. A mechanism generally adopted afloat for facilitating the\r\nworking of the large guns recently introduced; the gun-carriage is thus\r\ncompressed to its slide or platform during the recoil, and set free\r\nagain by the turn of a handle for running up. It is of various forms;\r\none of the simpler kind used to be always applied to carronade slides.\r\n\r\nCOMPRESSOR-STOPPER. A contrivance for holding the chain-cable by\r\ncompression.\r\n\r\nCOMPROMISE. The mutual agreement of a party or parties at difference, to\r\nrefer to arbitration, or make an end of the matter.\r\n\r\nCOMPTROLLER OF THE CUSTOMS.

A barrack term for a fellow-soldier, serving in the same\r\ncompany.\r\n\r\nCONCEALMENT, OR SUPPRESSIO VERI. Consists in the suppression of any fact\r\nor circumstance as to the state of the ship, the nature of her employ,\r\nand the time of sailing or expected arrival, material to the risk of\r\ninsurance, and is fatal to the insured. But it is held immaterial to\r\ndisclose the secret destination of privateers, the usages of trade, or\r\nmatters equally open to both parties.\r\n\r\nCONCENTRATED FIRE. The bringing the whole or several guns to bear on a\r\nsingle point.\r\n\r\nCONCH. A large univalve, used as a horn by pilots, fishermen, &c., in\r\nfogs: a _strombus_, _triton_, or sometimes a _murex_.\r\n\r\nCONCHS. A name for the wreckers of the Bahama reefs, in allusion to the\r\nshells on those shores. Though plunder is their object, the _Conchs_ are\r\nvery serviceable to humanity, and evince both courage and address in\r\nsaving the lives of the wrecked.\r\n\r\nCONCLUDING-LINE. A small rope hitched to the middle of the steps of the\r\nstern-ladders. Also, a small line leading through the centre of the\r\nsteps of a Jacob's ladder.\r\n\r\nCONDEMNATION. A captured ship declared by sentence of the admiralty\r\ncourt to be lawful prize.

Its use is to defend the ship from the effects of lightning,\r\nby conveying the electric fluid into the sea.\r\n\r\nCONE. A solid figure having a circle for its base, and produced by the\r\nentire revolution of a right-angled triangle about its perpendicular\r\nside, which is termed the axis of the cone.\r\n\r\nCONE-BUOY. _See_ CAN-BUOYS.\r\n\r\nCONEY-FISH.

The curved lines and plane figures which are produced by\r\nthe intersection of a plane with a cone.\r\n\r\nCONJEE. Gruel made of rice.\r\n\r\nCONJUGATE AXIS. The secondary diameter of an ellipse, perpendicular to\r\nthe transverse axis.\r\n\r\nCONJUNCTION, in nautical astronomy, is when two bodies have the same\r\nlongitude or right ascension.\r\n\r\nCONN, CON, OR CUN, as pronounced by seamen. This word is derived from\r\nthe Anglo-Saxon _conne_, _connan_, to know, or be skilful. The pilot of\r\nold was skillful, and later the master was selected to conn the ship in\r\naction, that is, direct the helmsman. The quarter-master during ordinary\r\nwatches conns the ship, and stands beside the wheel at the conn, unless\r\nclose-hauled, when his station is at the weather-side, where he can see\r\nthe weather-leeches of the sails.\r\n\r\nCONNECTING-ROD.

When the repair of damage sustained by the\r\nperils of the sea would cost more than the ship would be worth after\r\nbeing repaired.\r\n\r\nCONSUL. An officer established by a commission from the crown, in all\r\nforeign countries of any considerable trade, to facilitate business, and\r\nrepresent the merchants of his nation. They take rank with captains, but\r\nare to wait on them if a boat be sent. Commanders wait on consuls, but\r\nvice-consuls wait on commanders (_in Etiquette_). Ministers and _charges\r\nd'affaires_ retire in case of hostilities, but consuls are permitted to\r\nremain to watch the interests of their countrymen. When commerce began\r\nto flourish in modern Europe, occasion soon arose for the institution\r\nof a kind of court-merchant, to determine commercial affairs in a\r\nsummary way. Their authority depends very much on their commission, and\r\non the words of the treaty on which it is founded. The consuls are to\r\ntake care of the affairs of the trade, and of the rights, interests, and\r\nprivileges of their countrymen in foreign ports. Not being public\r\nministers, they are liable to the _lex loci_ both civil and criminal,\r\nand their exemption from certain taxes depends upon treaty and custom.\r\n\r\nCONTACT. Brought in contact with, as touching the sides of a ship. In\r\nastronomy, bringing a reflected body, as the sun, in contact with the\r\nmoon or with a star. (_See_ LUNAR DISTANCES, SEXTANT, &c.)\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.

In geography, a large extent of land which is not entirely\r\nsurrounded by water, or separated from other lands by the sea, as\r\nEurope, Asia, and Africa. It is also used in contradistinction to\r\n_island_, though America seems insulated.\r\n\r\nCONTINGENT. The quota of armed men, or pecuniary subsidy, which one\r\nstate gives to another. Also, certain allowances made to commanding\r\nofficers to defray necessary expenses.\r\n\r\nCONTINUED LINES. In field-works, means a succession of fronts without\r\nany interruption, save the necessary passages; differing thus from\r\n_interrupted lines_.\r\n\r\nCONTINUOUS SERVICE MEN. Those seamen who, having entered for a period,\r\non being paid off, are permitted to have leave, and return to the\r\nflag-ship at the port for general service.\r\n\r\nCONT-LINE. The space between the bilges of two casks stowed side by\r\nside.\r\n\r\nCONTOUR. The sweep of a ship's shape.\r\n\r\nCONTRABAND. The ship is involved in the legal fate of the cargo; the\r\nmaster should therefore be careful not to take any goods on board\r\nwithout all custom-house duties being paid up, and see that they be not\r\nprohibited by parliament or public proclamation. Contraband is simply\r\ndefined, \"merchandise forbidden by the law of nations to be supplied to\r\nan enemy;\" but it affords fat dodges to the admiralty court sharks.\r\n\r\nCONTRABAND OF WAR. Arms, ammunition, and all stores which may aid\r\nhostilities; masts, ship-timber going to an enemy's port, hemp,\r\nprovisions, and even money under stipulations, pitch and tar,\r\nsail-cloth.

The wind when opposed to a vessel's course.\r\n\r\n    \"Cruel was the stately ship that bore her love from Mary,\r\n    And cruel was the fair wind that wouldn't blow contrary.\"\r\n\r\nCONTRAVALLATION, LINES OF. Continuous lines of intrenchment round the\r\nbesieged fortress, and fronting towards it, to guard against any sorties\r\nfrom the place. (_See_ CIRCUMVALLATION.)\r\n\r\nCONTRIBUTION. Money paid in order to save a place from being plundered\r\nby a hostile force. (_See_ RANSOM.) Also, a sum raised among merchants,\r\nwhere goods have been thrown overboard in stress of weather, towards the\r\nloss of the owners thereof.\r\n\r\nCONTROLLER. Differs from _comptroller_, which applies chiefly to the\r\nduties of an _accompt_. But the controller of the navy controls naval\r\nmatters in ship-building, fitting, &c. There is also the controller of\r\nvictualling, and the controller-general of the coast-guard.\r\n\r\nCONTUMACY. The not appearing to the three calls of the admiralty court,\r\nafter the allegation has been presented to the judge, with a schedule of\r\nexpenses to be taxed, and an oath of their necessity.\r\n\r\nCONVALESCENT. Those men who are recovering health, but not sufficiently\r\nrecovered to perform their duties, are reported by the surgeon\r\n\"convalescent.\" Convalescents are _amused_ by picking oakum!\r\n\r\nCONVENIENT PORT. A general law-term in cases of capture, within a\r\ncertain latitude of discretion; a place where a vessel can lie in\r\nsafety, and holding ready communication with the tribunals which have to\r\ndecide the question of capture.\r\n\r\nCONVENTION. An agreement made between hostile troops, for the evacuation\r\nof a post, or the suspension of hostilities.\r\n\r\nCONVERGENT. In geography, a stream which comes into another stream, but\r\nwhose course is unknown, is simply a convergent.\r\n\r\nCONVERSION. Reducing a vessel by a deck, thereby converting a\r\nline-of-battle ship into a frigate, or a crank three-decker into a good\r\ntwo-decker; or a serviceable vessel into a hulk, resembling a prison or\r\ndungeon, internally and externally, as much as possible.\r\n\r\nCONVERSION OF STORES. Adapting the sails, ropes, or timbers from one\r\npurpose to another, with the least possible waste.\r\n\r\nCONVEXITY. The curved limb of the moon; an outward curve.\r\n\r\nCONVICT-SHIP.

A return of the merchantmen placed under the protection of\r\nmen-of-war, for safe conduct to their destination.\r\n\r\nCOOK. A man of each mess who is caterer for the day, and answerable\r\ntoo, wherefore he is allowed the surplus grog, termed _plush_ (which\r\nsee). The cook, _par excellence_, in the navy, was a man of importance,\r\nresponsible for the proper cooking of the food, yet not overboiling the\r\nmeat to extract the fat--his perquisite. The coppers were closely\r\ninspected daily by the captain, and if they soiled a cambric\r\nhandkerchief the cook's allowance was stopped. Now, the ship's cook is a\r\nfirst-class petty officer, and cannot be punished as heretofore. In a\r\nmerchantman the cook is, _ex officio_, the hero of the fore-sheet, as\r\nthe steward is of the main one.\r\n\r\nCOOKING A DAY'S WORK. To save the officer in charge.

These are chiefly used in boat-building, and for plank\r\nnails in the vicinity of the binnacle, as iron affects the\r\ncompass-needle. They are not to be confounded with _composition nails_,\r\nwhich are cast. (_See_ ROOF, OR ROVE and CLINCH.)\r\n\r\nCOPPERS.

They are generally faintly coloured at their edges.\r\nFrequently when there is a halo encircling the moon, there is a small\r\ncorona more immediately around it. Coronae, as well as halos, have been\r\nobserved to prognosticate rain, hail, or snow, being the result of snow\r\nor dense vapours nearer the earth, through which the object becomes\r\nhazy.\r\n\r\nCORONER. An important officer. Seamen should understand that his duties\r\nembrace all acts within a line drawn from one headland to another; or\r\nwithin the body of the county.

Is bracing the head-yards one way, and the\r\nafter-yards another. The counter-brace is the lee-brace of the\r\nfore-topsail-yard, but is only distinguished by this name at the time of\r\nthe ship's going about (called tacking), when the sail begins to shiver\r\nin the wind, this brace is hauled in to flatten the sail against the\r\nlee-side of the top-mast, and increase the effect of the wind in forcing\r\nher round. Counter-bracing becomes necessary to render the vessel\r\nstationary when sounding, lowering a boat, or speaking a stranger. It is\r\nnow an obsolete term, and the man[oe]uvre is called _heaving-to_.\r\n\r\nCOUNTER-CURRENT. That portion of water diverted from the main stream of\r\na current by the particular formation of the coast or other obstruction,\r\nand which therefore runs in a contrary direction.

Masonry adjuncts, advantageous to all retaining walls, but\r\nespecially to those which, like the escarps of fortresses, are liable to\r\nbe battered. They are attached at regular intervals to the hinder face\r\nof the wall, and perpendicular to it; having various proportions, but\r\ngenerally the same height as the wall; they hold it from being thrust\r\nforward from behind, and, even when it is battered away, retain the\r\nearth at the back at such a steep slope that the formation of a\r\npracticable breach remains very difficult. When arches are turned\r\nbetween the counterforts, the strength of the whole structure is much\r\nincreased: it is then called a _counter-arched revetement_.\r\n\r\nCOUNTERGUARD. In fortification, a smaller rampart raised in front of a\r\nlarger one, principally with the intention of delaying for a period the\r\nbesieger's attack. Other means, however, are generally preferred in\r\nmodern times, except when a rapid fall in the ground renders it\r\ndifficult to cover the main escarp by ordinary resources.\r\n\r\nCOUNTER-LINE.

The disturbed state of the sea after a gale, when, the wind\r\nhaving changed, the sea still runs in its old direction.\r\n\r\nCOUNTERSIGN. A particular word or number which is exchanged between\r\nsentinels, and intrusted to those on duty. (_See_ PAROLE.)\r\n\r\nCOUNTER-SUNK. Those holes which are made for the heads of bolts or nails\r\nto be sunk in, so as to be even with the general surface.\r\n\r\nCOUNTER-TIMBERS.

The direction taken by anything in motion, shown by the point of\r\nthe compass _towards_ which they run, as water in a river, tides, and\r\ncurrents; but of the wind, as similarly indicated by the compass-point\r\n_from_ which it blows. Course is also the ship's way. In common\r\nparlance, it is the point of the compass upon which the ship sails, the\r\ndirection in which she proceeds, or is intended to go. When the wind is\r\nfoul, she cannot \"lie her course;\" if free, she \"steers her course.\"\r\n\r\nCOURSES. A name by which the sails hanging from the lower yards of a\r\nship are usually distinguished, viz. the main-sail, fore-sail, and\r\nmizen: the staysails upon the lower masts are sometimes also\r\ncomprehended in this denomination, as are the main staysails of all\r\nbrigs and schooners. A ship is under her courses when she has no sail\r\nset but the fore-sail, main-sail, and mizen. _Trysails_ are courses\r\n(which see), sometimes termed _bentincks_.\r\n\r\nCOURSET. The paper on which the night's course is set for the officer in\r\ncharge of the watch.\r\n\r\nCOURT-MARTIAL.

Any witness\r\nsummoned--civil, naval, or military--by the judge-advocate, refusing to\r\nattend or give evidence, to be punished as for same in civil courts. The\r\nadmiralty can issue commissions to officers to hold courts-martial on\r\nforeign stations, without which they cannot be convened. A\r\ncommander-in-chief on a foreign station, holding such a commission, may\r\nunder his hand authorize an officer in command of a detached portion to\r\nhold courts-martial. Formerly all officers composing the court,\r\nattendants, witnesses, &c., were compelled to appear in their full-dress\r\nuniforms; but by recent orders, the undress uniform, with cocked hat and\r\nsword, is to be worn.\r\n\r\nCOUTEL.

In fortification, a space running along the outside of the\r\nditch for the convenient passage of troops and guns, covered from the\r\ncountry by a palisading and the parapet of the glacis. It is of\r\nimportance to an active defence, as besides enabling a powerful musketry\r\nfire to be poured on the near approaches of the besieger, it affords to\r\nthe garrison a secure base from which to sally in force at any hour of\r\nthe day or night.\r\n\r\nCOVERING-BOARD. _See_ PLANK-SHEER.\r\n\r\nCOVERING-PARTY. A force detached to protect a party sent on especial\r\nduty.\r\n\r\nCOVERT-WAY. _See_ COVERED WAY.\r\n\r\nCOW.

A sort of round flattish wooden block, or\r\noblate piece of elm, encircled, and fixed to the channels by the\r\nchain-plate: it is pierced with three holes through the flat part, in\r\norder to receive a rope called the laniard, which, corresponding with\r\nthree holes in another dead-eye on the shroud end, creates a purchase to\r\nset up and extend the shrouds and stays, backstays, &c., of the standing\r\nand top-mast rigging. The term _dead_ seems to have been used because\r\nthere is no revolving sheave to lessen the friction. In merchant-ships\r\nthey are generally fitted with iron-plates, in the room of chains,\r\nextending from the vessel's side to the top of the rail, where they are\r\nconnected with the rigging. The dead-eyes used for the stays have only\r\none hole, which, however, is large enough to receive ten or twelve turns\r\nof the laniard--these are generally termed _hearts_, on account of their\r\nshape. The _crowfeet dead-eyes_ are long cylindrical blocks with a\r\nnumber of small holes in them, to receive the legs or lines composing\r\nthe crow-foot. Also called _uvrous_.\r\n\r\nDEAD-FLAT.

When they commence earning money again, there is in some\r\nmerchant ships a ceremony performed of dragging round the decks an\r\neffigy of their fruitless labour in the shape of a horse, running him up\r\nto the yard-arm, and cutting him adrift to fall into the sea amidst loud\r\ncheers.\r\n\r\nDEAD-LIFT. The moving of a very inert body.\r\n\r\nDEAD-LIGHTS. Strong wooden shutters made exactly to fit the cabin\r\nwindows externally; they are fixed on the approach of bad weather.

This reckoning, however, should be\r\ncorrected by astronomical observations of the sun, moon, and stars,\r\nwhenever available, proving the importance of practical astronomy.\r\n\r\nDEAD-RISING. In ship-building, is that part of a ship which lies aft\r\nbetween the keel and her floor-timbers towards the stern-post; generally\r\nit is applied to those parts of the bottom, throughout the ship's\r\nlength, where the sweep or curve at the head of the floor-timber\r\nterminates, or inflects to join the keel. (_See_ RISING-LINE.)\r\n\r\nDEAD-ROPES. Those which do not run in any block.\r\n\r\nDEAD-SHARES.

Braced sharp up and bowlines hauled.\r\n\r\nDEAD-WATER. The eddy-water under the counter of a ship under way; so\r\ncalled because passing away slower than the water alongside. A ship is\r\nsaid to _make much dead-water_ when she has a great eddy following her\r\nstern, often occasioned by her having a square tuck. A vessel with a\r\nround buttock at her line of floatation can have but little dead-water,\r\nthe rounding abaft allowing the fluid soon to recover its state of rest.\r\n\r\nDEAD WEIGHT. A vessel's lading when it consists of heavy goods, but\r\nparticularly such as pay freight according to their weight and not their\r\n_stowage_.\r\n\r\nDEAD WOOD. Certain blocks of timber, generally oak, fayed on the upper\r\nside of the keel, particularly at the extremities before and abaft,\r\nwhere these pieces are placed upon each other to a considerable height,\r\nbecause the ship is there so narrow as not to admit of the two half\r\ntimbers, which are therefore scored into this dead wood, where the angle\r\nof the floor-timbers gradually diminishes on approaching the stem and\r\nstern-post. In the fore-part of the ship the dead wood generally extends\r\nfrom the stemson, upon which it is scarphed, to the loof-frame; and in\r\nthe after-end, from the stern-post, where it is confined by the knee, to\r\nthe after balance frame. It is connected to the keel by strong spike\r\nnails. The dead wood afore and abaft is equal in depth to two-thirds of\r\nthe depth of the keel, and as broad as can be procured, not exceeding\r\nthe breadth of the keel, _i.e._ continued as high as the _cutting-down_\r\nline in both bodies, to afford a stepping for the heels of the cant\r\ntimbers.\r\n\r\nDEAD-WOOD KNEES. The upper foremost and aftermost pieces of dead wood;\r\nbeing crooked pieces of timber, the bolting of which connects the keel\r\nwith the stem and stern posts.\r\n\r\nDEAD WORKS.

Applied to deal-planks when under 6 feet in length.\r\n\r\nDEATH OR MONEY BOATS. So termed from the risk in such frail craft. They\r\nwere very long, very narrow, and as thin as the skiffs of our rivers.\r\nDuring the war of 1800-14 they carried gold between Dover and Calais,\r\nand defied the custom-house officers.\r\n\r\nDEATH-WOUND. A law-term for the starting of a butt end, or springing a\r\nfatal leak. A ship had received her death-wound, but by pumping was kept\r\nafloat till three days after the time she was insured for: it was\r\ndetermined that the risk was at an end before the loss happened, and\r\nthat the insurer was not liable.\r\n\r\nDEBARK, TO. To land; to go on shore.\r\n\r\nDEBENTURE. A custom-house certificate given to the exporter of goods, on\r\nwhich a bounty or drawback is allowed.

To raise the camp; the breaking up from a place where an\r\narmy has been encamped.\r\n\r\nDECEPTIO VISUS. Any extraordinary instance of deception to the sight,\r\noccasioned by the effects of atmospheric media. (_See_ TERRESTRIAL\r\nREFRACTION and MIRAGE.)\r\n\r\nDECIMATION. The punishing every tenth soldier by lot, was truly\r\n_decimatio legionis_.\r\n\r\nDECIME. A small copper coin of France, equal to two sous, or one-tenth\r\nof a franc.\r\n\r\nDECK, TO. A word formerly in use for to trim, as \"we deckt up our\r\nsails.\"\r\n\r\nDECK-BEAM KNEES. The same as _lodging-knees_.\r\n\r\nDECK-BEAMS. _See_ BEAMS.\r\n\r\nDECK-CARGO, otherwise _deck-load_ (which see).\r\n\r\nDECK-CLEATS. Pieces of wood temporarily nailed to the deck to secure\r\nobjects in bad weather, as guns, deck-load, &c.\r\n\r\nDECK-HOOK. The compass timber bolted horizontally athwart a ship's bow,\r\nconnecting the stem, timbers, and deck-planks of the fore-part; it is\r\npart and parcel of the _breast-hooks_.\r\n\r\nDECK-HOUSE. An oblong-house on the deck of some merchantmen, especially\r\neast-country vessels, and latterly in passenger steamers, with a gangway\r\non each side of it. (Sometimes termed _round-house_.)\r\n\r\nDECK-LOAD. Timber, casks, or other cargo not liable to damage from wet,\r\nstowed on the deck of merchant vessels. This, with the exception of\r\ncarboys of vitriol, is not included in a general policy of insurance on\r\ngoods, unless it be specially stipulated.\r\n\r\nDECK-NAILS. A kind of spike with a snug head, commonly made in a diamond\r\nform; they are single or double deck-nails, and from 4 to 12 inches\r\nlong.\r\n\r\nDECK-PIPE. An iron pipe through which the chain cable is paid into the\r\nchain-locker.\r\n\r\nDECK-PUMPS. In a steamer, are at the side of the vessel, worked with a\r\nlever by manual power, to supply additional water. In a ship-of-war,\r\nused for washing decks (one of the midship pumps).\r\n\r\nDECKS. The platforms laid longitudinally over the transverse beams; in\r\nships of war they support the guns. The terms in use for these decks\r\nare, assuming the largest ship of the line:--_Poop_, the deck which\r\nincludes from the mizen-mast to the taffrail. The _upper_ or\r\n_spar-deck_, from stem to stern, having conventional divisions; as,\r\n_quarter-deck_, which is, when clear for action, the space abaft the\r\nmain-mast, including the cabin; next, _the waist_, between the fore and\r\nmain masts, on which the spars and booms are secured. In some ships guns\r\nare continued (always in flush-decked ships) along the gangway; then\r\n_the forecastle_, which commences on the gangway, from the main-tack\r\nchock forward to the bows. Small craft, as brigs and corvettes, are\r\nsometimes fitted with top-gallant forecastles, to shelter the men from\r\nheavy seas which wash over. Next, the _main or gun-deck_, the entire\r\nlength of the ship. It is also divided conventionally into the various\r\ncabins, the waist (under the gangway), the galley, from the\r\nfore-hatchway to the sick bay, and bows. Next below, is the _middle\r\ndeck_ of a three-decker, or _lower_ of a two-decker, succeeded by lower\r\ndeck and the orlop-deck, which carries no guns. The guns on these\r\nseveral decks increase in size and number from the poop downwards. Thus,\r\nalthough a vessel termed a three-decker was rated 120 guns, the fact\r\nstood thus:--\r\n\r\n                            Guns.      Pounders.        lbs.\r\n Poop,                       10           24             240\r\n Quarter-deck,               22           24 long    }   848\r\n Forecastle,                 10           32 cans.   }\r\n Main-deck,                  34           24             816\r\n Middle,                     36           24             864\r\n Lower,                      36           32            1152\r\n                           ----                         ----\r\n                            148                         3920\r\n                                                        ----\r\n                                           Broadside of 1960\r\n\r\nBut latterly, 56 and 84 pounders on the lower, and 32 on the middle,\r\nafforded a heavier weight of broadside. The _Santissima Trinidada_,\r\ntaken from the Spaniards, carried four whole tiers of guns. Now, the\r\ntonnage of the largest of these would be insignificant. \"Deckers\" are\r\nexploded, and a _Pallas_ of the same tonnage (2372) carries 8 guns, a\r\n_Bellerophon_ (4272) carries 18 guns, ranging in size, however, from the\r\n64-pounder up to the 300-pounder.--_Flush-deck_, or deck flush fore and\r\naft, implies a continued floor laid from stem to stern, upon one line,\r\nwithout any stops or intervals.--_Half-deck._ In the Northumberland\r\ncolliers the steerage itself is called the half-deck, and is usually the\r\nhabitation of the ship's crew.\r\n\r\nDECK-SEAM. The interstices between the planks.\r\n\r\nDECK-SHEET. That sheet of a studding-sail which leads directly to the\r\ndeck, by which it is steadied until set; it is also useful in taking it\r\nin, should the down-haul be carried away.\r\n\r\nDECK STANDARD-KNEES. Iron knees having two tails, the one going on the\r\nbottom of a deck-beam, the other on the top of a hold-beam, while the\r\nmiddle part is bolted to the ship's side.\r\n\r\nDECK-STOPPER. (_See_ STOPPER OF THE CABLE.) A strong stopper used for\r\nsecuring the cable forward of the capstan or windlass while it is\r\noverhauled. Also abaft the windlass or bitts to prevent more cable from\r\nrunning out.\r\n\r\nDECK-TACKLE. A purchase led along the decks.\r\n\r\nDECLARATION OF WAR. A ceremonial frequently omitted, and esteemed by the\r\ngreatest authorities rather a proof of magnanimity than a duty. The\r\nRomans proclaimed it; but except Achaia, none of the Grecian states did.\r\nIt would be to the interests of humanity and courtesy were it made\r\nindispensable. It has been held (especially in the case of the _Leopard_\r\nand _Chesapeake_) that without a declaration of war, no hostile act at\r\nthe order of an admiral is legal.\r\n\r\nDECLINATION, of a celestial object, is the arc between its centre and\r\nthe equinoctial: with the sun, it is its angular distance from the\r\nequator, either north or south, and is named accordingly.\r\n\r\nDECLINATION, TO CORRECT. A cant phrase for taking a glass of grog at\r\nnoon, when the day's works are being reduced.\r\n\r\nDECOY. So to change the aspect of a ship-of-war by striking a\r\ntopgallant-mast, setting ragged sails, disfiguring the sides by\r\nwhitewash or gunpowder, yellow, &c., as to induce a vessel of inferior\r\nforce to chase; when, getting within gun-shot range, she becomes an easy\r\ncapture. Similar man[oe]uvres are sometimes used by a single ship to\r\ninduce an enemy's squadron to follow her into the view of her own fleet.\r\n\r\nDEEP. A word figuratively applied to the ocean. On the coast of Germany,\r\nto the northward of Friesland, it is of the same import as gulf on the\r\ncoasts of France, Spain, Italy, &c. Also, any depth over 20\r\nfathoms.--_Deep-sea fishing._ In contradistinction to coast, or when the\r\nhand-lead reaches bottom at 20 fathoms.--_Hand deeps._ Out of ordinary\r\nleadsman's sounding.--A vessel is deep as regards her lading, and is\r\nalso said to sail deep when her expenses run high.\r\n\r\nDEEPENING. Running from shoal water by the lead.\r\n\r\nDEEP-SEA LINE. Usually a strong and water-laid line. It is used with\r\na lead of 28 lbs., and adapted to find bottom in 200 fathoms or more.\r\nIt is marked by knots every ten fathoms, and by a small knot every\r\nfive. The marks are now nearly superseded by Massey's patent\r\nsounding-machine.--_Marks and Deeps_, &c., _see_ LEAD and LINE.\r\n\r\nDEEP-WAIST. That part of the open skids between the main and fore drifts\r\nin men-of-war. It also relates to the remaining part of a ship's deck,\r\nwhen the quarter-deck and forecastle are much elevated above the level\r\nof the main-deck, so as to leave a vacant space, called the waist, on\r\nthe middle of the upper deck, as in many packets.\r\n\r\nDEESE. An east-country term for a place where herrings are dried.\r\n\r\nDEFAULTER'S BOOK. Where men's offences are registered against them, and\r\nmay be magnified without appeal.\r\n\r\nDEFECTS. An official return of the state of a ship as to what is\r\nrequired for her hull and equipment, and what repairs she stands in need\r\nof. Upon this return a ship is ordered to sea, into harbour, into dock,\r\nor paid out of commission.\r\n\r\nDEFICIENCY. What is wanting of a ship's cargo at the time of delivery.\r\n\r\nDEFILADE. In fortification, is the art of so disposing defensive works,\r\n_on irregular or commanded sites_, that the troops within them shall be\r\ncovered from the direct fire of the enemy.\r\n\r\nDEFILE. A narrow pass between two heights, which obliges a force\r\nmarching through to narrow its front. This may prove disastrous if\r\nattacked, on account of the difficulty of receiving aid from the rear.\r\n\r\nDEFILING. Filing off, marching past.\r\n\r\nDEFINITIVE. Conclusive; decisive.\r\n\r\nDEFLECTION. The tendency of a ship from her true course; the departure\r\nof the magnetic needle from its true bearing, when influenced by iron or\r\nthe local attraction of the mass. In artillery, the deviation of a shot\r\nfrom the direction in which it is fired. The term is usually reserved to\r\nlateral deviations, especially those resulting from irregular\r\ncauses--those constant ones due to the regular motion of rifled\r\nprojectiles coming under either of the designations \"constant\r\ndeflection,\" \"derivation,\" borrowed from the French, or \"drift,\" from\r\nthe Americans. These latter, according to the direction usually given to\r\nthe rifling in the present day, all tend away to the right, though they\r\ninclude some subordinate curves not yet distinctly determined.\r\n\r\nDEFORMED BASTION. One out of shape from the irregularity of its lines\r\nand angles.\r\n\r\nDEGRADATION. Debasement and disgrace. The suspension of a petty officer\r\nfrom his station; and also the depriving an officer or soldier of his\r\narms previous to his being delivered over to the civil power for\r\nexecution.\r\n\r\nDEGREE. A degree of longitude is the 1-360th part of the great\r\nequatorial circle, or any circle parallel to it. A degree of latitude is\r\nthe 90th part of the quadrant, or quarter of a great meridional circle.\r\nEach degree is divided into 60 minutes, and each minute into 60 seconds,\r\naccording to the sexagesimal division of the circle. Also, rank or\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\nDEKOYTS, OR DACOITS. Robbers in India, and also pirates who infested the\r\nrivers between Calcutta and Burhampore, but now suppressed by the\r\nimproved system of river police, and the establishment of fast rowing\r\nboats of light draught.\r\n\r\nDEL. Saxon for part.--_Del a bit_, not a bit, a phrase much altered for\r\nthe worse by those not aware of its antiquity.\r\n\r\nDEL CREDERE. A percentage on a cargo, under particular circumstances of\r\ntrust. Also, the commission under which brokers sometimes guarantee to\r\nthe insured the solvency of the underwriters.\r\n\r\nDELEGATES. Not heard of in the navy since the mutiny at the Nore.\r\n\r\nDELFYN. The old form of spelling _dolphin_.\r\n\r\nDELICTUM. To be actual, must unite intention and act.\r\n\r\nDELIVER. To yield, to rescue, to deliver battle, to deliver a broadside,\r\na shot, or a blow. Also, to take goods from the ship to the shore. To\r\ndischarge a cargo from a vessel into the keeping of its consignees.\r\n\r\nDELIVERED. The state of the harpoon when imbedded in the body of a fish,\r\nso that the barbs hold fast.\r\n\r\nDELIVERERS. Particular artificers employed in our early ships of war, in\r\nconstructing the castles.\r\n\r\nDELL. A narrow valley, ravine, or small dale.\r\n\r\nDELTA. A name given by the Greeks to the alluvial tract inclosed between\r\nthe bifurcating branches of the Nile and the sea-line. It is well known\r\nthat rivers which deposit great quantities of matter, do also very often\r\nseparate into two or more branches, previous to their discharge into the\r\nsea; thus forming triangular spaces, aptly called _deltas_ from their\r\nresemblance to the Greek letter {D}.\r\n\r\nAll deltas appear by their section to be formed of matter totally\r\ndifferent from that of the adjacent country. They are the creation of\r\nthe rivers themselves, which, having brought down with their floods vast\r\nquantities of mud and sand from the upper lands, deposit them in the\r\nlowest place, the sea; at whose margin, the current which has hitherto\r\nimpelled them ceasing, they are deposited by the mere action of gravity.\r\nThis is particularly illustrated on the western coast of Africa by the\r\nshoals off the Rio Grande, Rio Nunez, and others. The coast, as well as\r\nthe embouchures of the rivers, exhibit a deposit of deep mud, and yet\r\nfar at sea banks of clean siliceous sand arise.\r\n\r\nDEMAND. The official paper by which stores are desired for a ship, the\r\nmaking out of which is the duty of the officer in whose charge the\r\nstores will be placed: they must be approved by the captain and admiral\r\nbefore being presented to the dockyard authorities. Also, whence from?\r\nwhere bound?\r\n\r\nDEMI-BASTION. In fortification, a bastion which has a flank on one side\r\nonly.\r\n\r\nDEMI-CANNON. An ancient name for a gun carrying a ball of 33 pounds\r\nweight, with a length of from 12 to 14 feet, and a diameter of bore of\r\n6-1/2 inches; its point-blank range was estimated at 162 paces, and its\r\nrandom one at 2000.\r\n\r\nDEMI-CULVERIN. An ancient cannon which threw a ball of 9 pounds weight,\r\nwas about 9 feet long, and 4 inches in diameter of bore; its point-blank\r\nrange was called 174 paces, and its random one about 1800.\r\n\r\nDEMIHAG. A long pistol, much used in the sixteenth century.\r\n\r\nDEMILANCE. A light horseman, who carried a light lance.\r\n\r\nDEMILUNE. In fortification, the outwork, more properly called a\r\n_ravelin_ (which see).\r\n\r\nDEMI-REVETMENT. In fortification, that form of retaining wall for the\r\nface of a rampart which is only carried up as high as cover exists in\r\nfront of it, leaving above it the remaining height, in the form of an\r\nearthen mound at its natural slope, exposed to, but invulnerable by\r\nshot.\r\n\r\nDEMONSTRATION-SHIPS. Those kept in a certain state of preparation for\r\nwar, though on a peace establishment.\r\n\r\nDEMURRAGE. The compensation due to a ship-owner from a freighter for\r\nunduly delaying his vessel in port beyond the time specified in the\r\ncharter-party or bill of lading. It is in fact an extended freight. A\r\nship unjustly detained, as a prize, is entitled to demurrage. Vessels\r\nchartered to convey government stores have a term given for discharge by\r\ngovernment aid. If not delivered within that period, demurrage, as\r\nstated in the document, is paid per diem for any \"unavoidable delay.\"\r\n\r\nDEN. A sandy tract near the sea, as at Exmouth and other places.\r\n\r\nDEN AND STROND. A liberty for ships or vessels to run or come ashore.\r\nEdward I. granted this privilege to the barons of the Cinque Ports.\r\n\r\nDE NAUTICO F[OE]NORE. Of nautical usury; bottomry.\r\n\r\nDENE. The Anglo-Saxon _daene_; implying a kind of hollow or ravine\r\nthrough which a rivulet runs, the banks on either side being studded\r\nwith trees.\r\n\r\nDENEB. The bright star in the constellation Cygnus, well known as a\r\nstandard nautical star.\r\n\r\nDENSITY. The weight of a body in comparison with its bulk.\r\n\r\nDENTICE. An excellent fish, so named from being well furnished with\r\nteeth. It is of the _Sparidae_ family, and frequents the Adriatic.\r\n\r\nDEPARTMENT. A term by which the divisions in the public services are\r\ndistinguished, as the civil, the commissariat, the military, the naval,\r\nthe victualling, &c.\r\n\r\nDEPARTURE. The bearing of an object on the coast from which a vessel\r\ncommences her dead-reckoning and takes her departure. The distance of\r\nany two places lying on the same parallel counted in miles of the\r\nequator.\r\n\r\nDEPOT. A magazine in which military stores are deposited. Also, a\r\ncompany left in England for the purpose of recruiting when regiments are\r\nordered abroad.\r\n\r\nDEPRESS. The order to adjust the quoin in great-gun exercise; to depress\r\nthe muzzle to point at an object below the level, in contradistinction\r\nto elevate.\r\n\r\nDEPRESSED POLE. That end of the earth's axis which is below the horizon\r\nof the spectator according to his being in the northern or southern\r\nhemisphere. Also applied to the stars. (_See_ POLAR DISTANCE.)\r\n\r\nDEPRESSION, OF THE HORIZON. (_See_ DIP.) In artillery, the angle below\r\nthe horizon at which the axis of a gun is laid in order to strike an\r\nobject on a lower level. The depression required in batteries of very\r\nelevated site (those of Gibraltar for example), for the laying the guns\r\non near vessels, is so great as to necessitate a peculiar carriage.\r\n\r\nDEPTH OF A SAIL. The extent of the square sails from the head-rope to\r\nthe foot-rope, or the length of the after-leech of a staysail or\r\nboom-sail; in other words, it is the extent of the longest cloth of\r\ncanvas in any sail.\r\n\r\nDEPTH OF HOLD. The height between the floor and the lower-deck; it is\r\ntherefore one of the principal dimensions given for the construction of\r\na ship. It varies, of course, according to the end for which she is\r\ndesigned, trade or war.\r\n\r\nDERELICT [Lat. _derelictus_, abandoned]. Anything abandoned at sea. A\r\nship is derelict either by consent or by compulsion, stress of weather,\r\n&c., and yet, to save the owner's rights, if any cat, dog, or other\r\ndomestic animal be found on board alive, it is not forfeited. The owner\r\nmay yet recover, on payment of salvage, within a year and a\r\nday--otherwise the whole may be awarded. (_See_ SALVAGE.)\r\n\r\nDERIVATION. In artillery, the constant deflection of a rifled\r\nprojectile. (_See_ DEFLECTION.)\r\n\r\nDERRICK. A single spar, supported by stays and guys, to which a purchase\r\nis attached, used in loading and unloading vessels. Also, a small crane\r\neither inside or outside of a ship.\r\n\r\nDERRICK, TO. A cant term for setting out on a small not over-creditable\r\nenterprise. The act is said to be named from a Tyburn executioner.\r\n\r\nDERRING-DO. A Spenserian term for deeds of arms.\r\n\r\nDESCENDING NODE. _See_ NODES.\r\n\r\nDESCENDING SIGNS. Those in which the sun appears to descend from the\r\nnorth pole, or in which his motion in declination is towards the south.\r\n\r\nDESCENDING SQUALL. A fitful gust of wind issuing from clouds which are\r\nformed in the lower parts of the atmosphere. It is usually accompanied\r\nwith heavy showers, and the weatherwise observe that the squall is\r\nseldom so violent when it is followed as when it is preceded by rain.\r\n(_See_ WHITE SQUALL as a forerunner.)\r\n\r\nDESCENSION. The same as _oblique ascension_ (which see).\r\n\r\nDESCENT. The landing of troops for the purpose of invading a country.\r\nThe passage down a river.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION-BOOK. A register in which the age, place of birth, and\r\npersonal description of the crew are recorded.\r\n\r\nDESERT. An extensive tract, either absolutely sterile, or having no\r\nother vegetation than small patches of grass or shrubs. Many portions of\r\nthe present deserts seem to be reclaimable.\r\n\r\nDESERTER. One that quits his ship or the service without leave. He is\r\nmarked R (_run_) on the books, and any clothes or other effects he may\r\nhave left on board are sold by auction at the mast, and the produce\r\nborne to account.\r\n\r\nDESERTION. The act of quitting the Army or Navy without leave, with\r\nintention not to return.\r\n\r\nDESERTION-MONEY. The sum of three pounds paid to him who apprehends a\r\ndeserter, which is charged against the offender's growing pay--his wages\r\nfor previous service having become forfeited from his having _run_.\r\n\r\nDESTROYING PAPERS. A ground of condemnation in the Admiralty court.\r\n\r\nDETACHED. On detached service. A squadron may be detached under a\r\ncommodore or senior officer.\r\n\r\nDETACHED BASTION. A bastion cut off by a ditch about its gorge from the\r\nbody of the place, which latter is thus rendered in a degree independent\r\nof the fall of the former.\r\n\r\nDETACHED ESCARP. An escarp wall, originally invented by Carnot, and\r\nrevived by the Prussians, removed some distance to the front of the\r\nrampart; which latter, being finished exteriorly at the natural slope of\r\nthe earth, remains effective after the destruction of the wall by a\r\nbesieger. It was at first intended, being kept low and covered by a near\r\ncounterguard, to offer extraordinary difficulties to the besieger's\r\nbreaching batteries; but improved artillery has nullified that supposed\r\nadvantage.\r\n\r\nDETACHED WORKS. Works included in the scheme of defence of a fortress,\r\nbut separated from it, and beyond the glacis.\r\n\r\nDETACHMENT. A force detached from the main body for employment on any\r\nparticular service.\r\n\r\nDETAIL OF DUTY. The captain's night orders.\r\n\r\nDETENTION OF A VESSEL: on just ground, as supposed war, suspicious\r\npapers, undue number of men, found hovering, or cargo not in conformity\r\nwith papers or law.\r\n\r\nDETONATING HAMMER. A modern introduction into the Royal Navy for firing\r\nthe guns. With the aid of an attached laniard, it is made to descend\r\nforcibly upon the percussion arm of the tube, and fires the piece\r\ninstantaneously. It is, however, already generally superseded by the use\r\nof the _friction-tube_ (which see).\r\n\r\nDEVIATION. A voluntary departure from the usual course of the voyage,\r\nwithout any necessary or justifiable cause: a step which discharges the\r\ninsurers from further responsibility. Liberty to touch, stay, or trade\r\nin any particular place not in the usual course of the voyage must be\r\nexpressly specified in the contract, and even this is subordinate to the\r\nvoyage. The cases of necessity which justify deviation are--1, stress of\r\nweather; 2, urgent want of repairs; 3, to join convoy; 4, succouring\r\nships in distress; 5, avoiding capture or detention; 6, sickness; 7,\r\nmutiny of the crew. It differs from a _change_ of voyage, which must\r\nhave been resolved upon before the sailing of the ship. (_See_\r\nCHANGE.)--_Deviation_ is also the attraction of a ship's iron on the\r\nneedle. It is a term recently introduced to distinguish a sort of second\r\nvariation to be allowed for in iron vessels.\r\n\r\nDEVIL. A sort of priming made by damping and bruising gunpowder.\r\n\r\nDEVIL-BOLTS. Those with false clenches, often introduced into\r\ncontract-built ships.\r\n\r\nDEVIL-FISH. The _Lophius piscatorius_, a hideous creature, which has\r\nalso obtained the name of fish-frog, monk-fish, bellows-fish, sea-devil,\r\nand other appellatives significant of its ugliness and bad manners.\r\nThere is also a powerful _Raia_, which grows to an immense size in the\r\ntropics, known as the devil-fish, the terror of the pearl-divers.\r\n_Manta_ of Spaniards.\r\n\r\nDEVILRY. Spirited roguery; wanton mischief, short of crime.\r\n\r\nDEVIL'S CLAW. A very strong kind of split hook made to grasp a link of a\r\nchain cable, and used as a stopper.\r\n\r\nDEVIL'S SMILES. Gleams of sunshine among dark clouds, either in the\r\nheavens or captain's face!\r\n\r\nDEVIL'S TABLE-CLOTH. _See_ TABLE-CLOTH.\r\n\r\nDEVIL TO PAY AND NO PITCH HOT. The seam which margins the water-ways was\r\ncalled the \"devil,\" why only caulkers can tell, who perhaps found it\r\nsometimes difficult for their tools. The phrase, however, means service\r\nexpected, and no one ready to perform it. Impatience, and naught to\r\nsatisfy it.\r\n\r\nDEW-POINT. A meteorological term for the degree of temperature at which\r\nthe moisture of the atmosphere would begin to precipitate; it may be\r\nreadily ascertained by means of the hygrometer.\r\n\r\nDHOLL. A kind of dried split pea supplied in India to the navy.\r\n\r\nDHONY, OR DHONEY. A country trading-craft of India from 50 to 150 tons;\r\nmostly flat-bottomed. (_See_ DONEY.)\r\n\r\nDHOW. The Arab dhow is a vessel of about 150 to 250 tons burden by\r\nmeasurement--grab-built, with ten or twelve ports; about 85 feet long\r\nfrom stem to stern, 20 feet 9 inches broad, and 11 feet 6 inches deep.\r\nOf late years this description of vessel has been well built at Cochin,\r\non the Malabar coast, in the European style. They have a great rise of\r\nfloor; are calculated for sailing with small cargoes; and are fully\r\nprepared, by internal equipment, for defence--many of them are sheathed\r\non 2-1/2-inch plank bottoms, with 1-inch board, and the preparation of\r\nchunam and oil, called _galgal_, put between; causing the vessel to be\r\nvery dry and durable, and preventing the encroachments of the worm or\r\n_Teredo navalis_. The worm is one of the greatest enemies in India to\r\ntimber _in_ the water, as the white ant (_termites_) is out of it. On\r\nthe outside of the sheathing board there is a coat of whitewash, made\r\nfrom the same materials as that between the sheathing and planks, and\r\nrenewed every season they put to sea. They have generally one mast and a\r\nlateen sail. The yard is the length of the vessel aloft, and the mast\r\nrakes forward, for the purpose of keeping this ponderous weight clear in\r\nraising and lowering. The tack of the sail is brought to the stem-head,\r\nand sheets aft in the usual way. The halyards lead to the taffrail,\r\nhaving a pendant and treble purchase block, which becomes the backstay,\r\nto support the mast when the sail is set. This, with three pairs of\r\nshrouds, completes the rigging, the whole made of _coir_ rope. Several\r\nof these vessels were fitted as brigs, after their arrival in Arabia,\r\nand armed by the Arabs for cruising in the Red Sea and Arabian Gulf, as\r\npiratical vessels. It was of this class of vessel that Tippoo Sultan's\r\nnavy at Onore consisted. The large dhows generally make one voyage in\r\nthe season, to the southward of Arabia; taking advantage of the\r\nnorth-east monsoon to come down, and the south-west to return with an\r\nexchange cargo. The Arabs who man them are a powerful well-grown people,\r\nand very acute and intelligent in trade. They usually navigate their\r\nships to Bengal in perfect safety, and with great skill. This was well\r\nknown to Captain Collier and his officers of the _Liverpool_ frigate,\r\nwhen they had the trial cruise with the Imam of Muscat's fine frigate in\r\n1820.\r\n\r\nDIACLE.

A metal ladle for taking boiling pitch from the cauldron.\r\n\r\nDIPPING-NEEDLE. An instrument for ascertaining the amount of the\r\nmagnet's inclination towards the earth; it is so delicately suspended,\r\nthat, instead of vibrating horizontally, one end _dips_ or yields to the\r\nvertical force. This instrument has been so perfected by Mr. R. W. Fox\r\nof Falmouth, that even at sea in the heaviest gales of wind the dip\r\ncould instantly, by magnetic deflectors, be ascertained to _minutes_,\r\nfar beyond what heretofore could be elicited from the most expensive\r\ninstruments, observed over 365 days on shore.\r\n\r\nDIPPING-NET. A small net used for taking shad and other fish out of the\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nDIPS. _See_ LEAD-LINE.\r\n\r\nDIP-SECTOR. An ingenious instrument for measuring the true dip of the\r\nhorizon, invented by Dr. Wollaston, and very important, not only where\r\nthe nature and quantity of the atmospherical refraction are to be\r\nexamined, but for ascertaining the rates of chronometers, and the exact\r\nlatitude in those particular regions where accidental refractions are\r\nvery great, for the difference between the calculated dip and that\r\nobserved by the sector may exceed three minutes.

[Ital.] An old term meaning to unlade a vessel.\r\n\r\nDISCHARGED. When applied to a ship, signifies when she is unladen. When\r\nexpressed of the officers or crew, it implies that they are disbanded\r\nfrom immediate service; and in individual cases, that the person is\r\ndismissed in consequence of long service, disability, or at his own\r\nrequest. When spoken of cannon, it means that it is fired off.\r\n\r\nDISCHARGE-TICKET. On all foreign stations men are discharged by _foreign\r\nremove-tickets_, and in other cases by _dead_, _sick_, or _unserviceable\r\nticket_, whether at home or abroad.\r\n\r\nDISCHARGE-VALVE.

The difference between the semi-diameter\r\nof the base-ring at the breech of a gun, and that of the ring at the\r\nswell of the muzzle. On account of the dispart, the line of aim makes a\r\nsmall angle with the axis; so that the elevation of the latter above the\r\nhorizon is greater than that of the line of aim: an allowance for the\r\ndispart is consequently necessary in determining the commencement of the\r\ngraduations on the tangent scale, by which the required elevation is\r\ngiven to the gun.\r\n\r\nDISPARTING A GUN. To bring the line of sight and line of metal to be\r\nparallel by setting up a mark on the muzzle-ring of a cannon, so that a\r\nsight-line, taken from the top of the base-ring behind the touch-hole,\r\nto the mark set near the muzzle, may be parallel to the axis of the\r\nbore. (_See_ GUN.)\r\n\r\nDISPART-SIGHT. A gun-sight fixed on the top of the second\r\nreinforce-ring--about the middle of the piece--for point-blank or\r\nhorizontal firing, to eliminate the difference of the diameters between\r\nthe breech and the mouth of the cannon.\r\n\r\nDISPATCH. All duty is required to be performed with diligence.\r\n\r\nDISPATCHES.

Flags of distinction, badges, honourable note of\r\nsuperiority.\r\n\r\nDISTINGUISHING PENDANT. In fleets and squadrons, instead of hoisting\r\nseveral flags to denote the number of the ship on the list of the Navy,\r\npendants are used. Thus ten ships may be signalled separately.

A term used when a ship requires immediate assistance from\r\nunlooked-for damage or danger. (_See_ SIGNAL OF DISTRESS.)\r\n\r\nDISTRICT ORDERS. Those issued by a general commanding a district.\r\n\r\nDISTURBANCE. _See_ SPANISH DISTURBANCE.\r\n\r\nDITCH. In fortification the excavation in front of the parapet of any\r\nwork, ranging in width from a few feet in field fortification to thirty\r\nor forty yards in permanent works, having its steep side next the\r\nrampart called the escarp: the opposite one is the counterscarp. Its\r\nprincipal use is to secure the escarp as long as possible. There are wet\r\nditches and dry ones, the former being less in favour than the latter,\r\nsince a dry ditch so much facilitates sorties, counter-approaches, and\r\nthe like. That kind which may be made wet or dry at pleasure is most\r\nuseful.\r\n\r\nDITTY-BAG. Derives its name from the _dittis_ or Manchester stuff of\r\nwhich it was once made. It is in use among seamen for holding their\r\nsmaller necessaries. The ditty-bag of old, when a seaman prided himself\r\non his rig, as the result of his own ability to fit himself from clue to\r\nearing, was a treasured article, probably worked in exquisite device by\r\nhis lady-love. Well can we recollect the pride exhibited in its display\r\nwhen \"on end clothes\" was a joyful sound to the old pig-tailed tar.\r\n\r\nDITTY-BOX. A small caddy for holding a seaman's stock of _valuables_.\r\n\r\nDIURNAL ARC.

A select number of ships in a fleet or squadron of men-of-war,\r\ndistinguished by a particular flag, pendant, or vane. A squadron may be\r\nranged into two or three divisions, the commanding officer of which is\r\nalways stationed in the centre. In a fleet the admiral divides it into\r\nthree squadrons, each of which is commanded by an admiral, and is again\r\ndivided into divisions; each squadron had its proper colours (now\r\ndistinguishing mark) according to the rank of the admiral who commanded\r\nit, and each division its proper mast. The private ships carried\r\npendants of the same colour with their respective squadrons at the masts\r\nof their particular divisions, so that the ships in the last division of\r\nthe blue squadron carried a blue pendant at their main topgallant-mast\r\nhead, the vane at the mizen. All these are superseded by the abolition\r\nof the Red and Blue. The St. George's white ensign flag and pendant\r\nalone are used.\r\n\r\nDIVISIONS. The sub-classification of a ship's company under the\r\nlieutenants. Also, a muster of the crew. Also, of an army, a force\r\ngenerally complete in itself, commanded by a major-general, of an\r\naverage strength of eight or ten thousand men: it is itself composed of\r\nseveral brigades, each of which again is composed of several battalions,\r\nbesides the complement of artillery, transport-corps, and generally also\r\nof cavalry, for the whole. Of a battalion, a term sometimes used in\r\nexercise, when the companies of a battalion have been equalized as to\r\nstrength, for one of such companies.\r\n\r\nDJERME. _See_ JERME.\r\n\r\nDOA.

A phrase on our southern coasts for sea-gravel mixed with sand.\r\n\r\nDOCK. An artificial receptacle for shipping, in which they can discharge\r\nor take in cargo, and refit.--A _dry dock_ is a broad and deep trench,\r\nformed on the side of a harbour, or on the banks of a river, and\r\ncommodiously fitted either to build ships in or to receive them to be\r\nrepaired or breamed. They have strong flood-gates, to prevent the flux\r\nof the tide from entering while the ship is under repair. There are\r\nlikewise docks where a ship can only be cleaned during the recess of the\r\ntide, as she floats again on the return of the flood. Docks of the\r\nlatter kind are not furnished with the usual flood-gates; but the term\r\nis also used for what is more appropriately called a _float_ (which\r\nsee). Also, in polar parlance, an opening cut out of an ice-floe, into\r\nwhich a ship is warped for security.\r\n\r\nDOCK-DUES. The charges made upon shipping for the use of docks.\r\n\r\nDOCKERS. Inhabitants of the town which sprang up between the docks and\r\nthe town of Plymouth. Dock solicited and obtained the royal license, in\r\n1823, to be called Devonport--a very inappropriate name, Plymouth being\r\nwholly within the county of Devon, while Hamoaze is equally in Devon and\r\nCornwall.\r\n\r\nDOCK HERSELF, TO. When a ship is on the ooze, and swaddles a bed, she is\r\nsaid to dock herself.\r\n\r\nDOCKING A SHIP. The act of drawing her into dock, and placing her\r\nproperly on blocks, in order to give her the required repair, cleanse\r\nthe bottom, and cover it anew. (_See_ BREAMING.)\r\n\r\nDOCK UP, OR DUCK UP. To clue up a corner of a sail that hinders the\r\nhelmsman from seeing.\r\n\r\nDOCKYARD DUTY. The attendance of a lieutenant and party in the arsenal,\r\nfor stowing, procuring stores, &c.\r\n\r\nDOCKYARD MATIES. The artificers in a dockyard. In former times an\r\nestablished declaration of war between the mates and midshipmen _versus_\r\nthe maties was hotly kept up. Many deaths and injuries never disclosed\r\nwere hushed up or patiently borne. It terminated about 1830.\r\n\r\nDOCKYARDS. Arsenals containing all sorts of naval stores and timber for\r\nship-building. In England the royal dockyards are at Deptford, Woolwich,\r\nChatham, Sheerness, Portsmouth, Devonport, Pembroke. Those in our\r\ncolonies are at the Cape of Good Hope, Gibraltar, Malta, Bermuda,\r\nHalifax, Jamaica, Antigua, Trincomalee, and Hong Kong. There Her\r\nMajesty's ships and vessels of war are generally moored during peace,\r\nand such as want repairing are taken into the docks, examined, and\r\nrefitted for service. These yards are generally supplied from the north\r\nwith hemp, pitch, tar, rosin, canvas, oak-plank, and several other\r\nspecies of stores. The largest masts are usually imported from New\r\nEngland. Until 1831 these yards were governed by a commissioner resident\r\nat the port, who superintended all the musters of the officers,\r\nartificers, and labourers employed in the dockyard and ordinary; he also\r\ncontrolled their payment, examined their accounts, contracted and drew\r\nbills on the Navy Office to supply the deficiency of stores, and,\r\nfinally, regulated whatever belonged to the dockyard. In 1831 the\r\ncommissioners of the Navy were abolished, and admirals and captains\r\nsuperintendent command the dockyards under the controller of the Navy\r\nand the Admiralty.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR. A name which seamen apply to every medical officer. Also, a\r\njocular name for the ship's cook.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR'S LIST. The roll of those excused from duty by reason of illness.\r\n\r\nDODD.

When the moon's diameter exceeds the sun's,\r\nand their centres nearly coincide, a _total eclipse_ of the sun takes\r\nplace; but if the moon's diameter be less, then the eclipse is\r\n_annular_.\r\n\r\nECLIPTIC. The great circle of the heavens which the sun appears to us to\r\ndescribe in the course of a year, in consequence of the earth's motion\r\nround that luminary. It is inclined to the equinoctial at an angle of\r\nnearly 23 deg. 28', called the obliquity of the ecliptic, and cuts it in\r\ntwo points diametrically opposite to each other, called the equinoctial\r\npoints. The time when the sun enters each of these points (which occurs\r\nabout the 20th of March and 23d of September, respectively) is termed\r\nthe equinox, day and night being then equal; at these periods,\r\nespecially about the time of the vernal equinox, storms, called the\r\nequinoctial gales, are prevalent in many parts of the globe. The two\r\npoints of the ecliptic, which are each 90 deg. distant from the\r\nequinoctial points, are called the solstitial points. That great circle\r\nwhich passes through the equinoctial points and the poles of the earth,\r\nis called the equinoctial colure; and that which passes through the\r\nsolstitial points and the poles of the earth, the solstitial colure.\r\n\r\nECLIPTIC CONJUNCTION. Is the moon in conjunction with the sun at the\r\ntime of new moon, both luminaries having then the same longitude, or\r\nright ascension.\r\n\r\nECLIPTIC LIMITS. Certain limits of latitude within which eclipses take\r\nplace, and beyond which they cannot occur.\r\n\r\nECONOMY. A term expressive of the system and internal arrangement\r\npursued in a ship.\r\n\r\nEDDY. Sometimes used for the dead-water under a ship's counter. Also,\r\nthe water that by some interruption in its course, runs contrary to the\r\ndirection of the tide or current, and appears like the motion of a\r\nwhirlpool. Eddies in the sea not unfrequently extend their influence to\r\na great distance, and are then merely regarded as contrary or revolving\r\ncurrents. It is the back-curl of the water to fill a space or vacuum\r\nformed sometimes by the faulty build of a vessel, having the after-body\r\nfuller than the fore, which therefore impedes her motion. It also occurs\r\nimmediately after a tide passes a strait, where the volume of water\r\nspreads suddenly out, and curves back to the edges. The Chinese pilots\r\ncall eddies, chow-chow water.\r\n\r\nEDDY-TIDE. When the water runs back from some obstacle to the free\r\npassage of the stream.\r\n\r\nEDDY-WIND. That which is beat back, or returns, from a sail, bluff hill,\r\nor anything which impedes its passage; in other words, whenever the\r\nedges or veins of two currents of air, coming from opposite directions,\r\nmeet, they form an eddy, or _whirlwind_ (which see). They are felt\r\ngenerally near high coasts intersected by ravines. The eddy-wind of a\r\nsail escaping, in a curve, makes the sail abaft shiver.\r\n\r\nEDGE AWAY, TO. To decline gradually from the course which the ship\r\nformerly steered, by sailing larger, or more off, or more away from\r\nbefore the wind than she had done before.\r\n\r\nEDGE DOWN, TO. To approach any object in an oblique direction.\r\n\r\nEDGING OF PLANK. Sawing or hewing it narrower.\r\n\r\nEDUCTION PIPE.

All tributaries are affluents.\r\n\r\nEGG, TO. To instigate, incite, provoke, to urge on: from the Anglo-Saxon\r\n_eggion_.\r\n\r\nEGGS. These nutritious articles of food might be used longer at sea than\r\nis usual. The shell of the egg abounds with small pores, through which\r\nthe aqueous part of the albumen constantly exhales, and the egg in\r\nconsequence daily becomes lighter, and approaches its decomposition.\r\nReaumur varnished them all over, and thus preserved eggs fresh for two\r\nyears; then carefully removing the varnish, he found that such eggs were\r\nstill capable of producing chickens. Some employ, with the same\r\nintention, lard or other fatty substance for closing the pores, and\r\nothers simply immerse the egg for an instant in boiling water, by which\r\nits albumen is in part coagulated, and the power of exhalation thereby\r\nchecked. Eggs packed in lime-water suffered to drain, have after three\r\nyears' absence in the West Indies been found good; this does not destroy\r\nvitality.\r\n\r\nEGMONT, OR PORT EGMONT FOWLS. The large Antarctic gulls with dark-brown\r\nplumage, called _shoemakers_.\r\n\r\nEGRESS. At a transit of an inferior planet over the sun, this term means\r\nthe passing off of the planet from his disc.\r\n\r\nEGYPTIAN HERRING.

In gunnery, that which the axis of the bore makes\r\nwith the plane of the horizon. It is attained by sinking the breech of\r\nthe gun until its axis points above the object to be fired at, so that\r\nthe shot may describe a curve somewhat similar to a parabola,\r\ncounteracting the action of gravity during its flight, and alighting\r\nupon the mark.\r\n\r\nELGER.

This in its wide sense, and recognizing\r\nits value to navigators and astronomers, must be pronounced one of the\r\nmost useful of publications. How Drake and Magellan got on is matter of\r\nmarvel, for sailors were not especially administered to till 1675, when\r\nthe _Kalendarium Nauticum_, by Henry Seaman, Mariner, appeared; it\r\ncomprised the usual matter of annual almanacs, and was enriched with\r\nsuch precepts and rules in the practice of navigation and traffic as are\r\nin daily use. But in 1767 our nautical almanac, a tabular statement of\r\nthe geocentric planetary positions, which may be said to have created a\r\nnew era in voyaging, was published; and this book, with certain\r\nalterations, was in force up to 1830, when a commission of the Royal\r\nSociety and astronomers established the present _Ephemeris_, now so much\r\nvalued. It is published annually, but computed to four years in advance,\r\nto accommodate those proceeding on long voyages.

There are several species, some of which\r\ngrow to a greater length than any other animals of the order, viz. 80 or\r\nperhaps 90 feet. They are very active and difficult to harpoon, yield\r\ncomparatively little oil, and their baleen, or \"whalebone,\" is almost\r\nworthless; consequently, they suffer much less than the right whales\r\nfrom the persecutions of the whalers. The finner, or great black fish,\r\nis feared by whalers in general. It is vicious, and can only be attacked\r\nby large boats in shallow water, as at the Bermudas, where the\r\nwhale-boats are about 50 or 60 feet long, and 12 feet beam. The fish\r\nyields one barrel of oil for every foot in length beyond thirty. (_See_\r\nRAZOR-BACK and RORQUAL.)\r\n\r\nFINNIE. A northern name for salmon under a year old.\r\n\r\nFINNOCK.

This diversity of\r\ncolour has now been long done away with. The white field, with the red\r\nSt. George's cross, and the sinister upper corner occupied by the union,\r\nis now alone used in the British navy--the blue being assigned to the\r\nreserve, and the red to the mercantile navy. An admiral still displays\r\nhis flag exclusively at the main truck; a vice-admiral at the fore; a\r\nrear-admiral at the mizen. The first flag in importance is the royal\r\nstandard of Great Britain and Ireland, hoisted only when the king or\r\nqueen is on board; the second is the anchor of hope, for the lord\r\nhigh-admiral, or the lords-commissioners of the admiralty; and the third\r\nis the union flag, for the admiral of the fleet, who is the next\r\nofficer under the lord high-admiral.

When a\r\ncouncil of war is held at sea, if it be on board the admiral's ship, a\r\nflag is hung on the main-shrouds; if the vice-admiral's, on the\r\nfore-shrouds; and if the rear-admiral's, on the mizen-shrouds. The flags\r\nborne on the mizen were particularly called gallants. There are also\r\nsmaller flags used for signals. The word _flag_ is often familiarly used\r\nto denote the admiral himself. Also, the reply from the boat if an\r\nadmiral is on board--Flag!\r\n\r\nFLAG-OFFICER. A term synonymous with _admiral_.\r\n\r\nFLAG OF TRUCE.

The action of hauling in the aftmost clue of a sail to\r\ngive it greater power of turning the vessel; thus, if the mizen or after\r\nsails are flatted in, it is to carry the stern to leeward, and the head\r\nto windward; and if, on the contrary, the head-sails are flatted in, the\r\nintention is to make the ship fall off when, by design or accident, she\r\nhas come so near as to make the sails shiver; hence _flatten in forward_\r\nis the order to haul in the jib and foretop-mast staysail-sheets towards\r\nthe middle of the ship, and haul forward the fore-bowline; this\r\noperation is seldom necessary except when the helm has not sufficient\r\ngovernment of the ship, as in variable winds or inattentive steerage.\r\n\r\nFLAUT. _See_ FLUTE.\r\n\r\nFLAVER.

In ship-building, is a ribband placed between the floor and\r\nthe keel.\r\n\r\nFLOOR-HEAD. This, in marine architecture, is the third diagonal,\r\nterminating the length of the floors near the bilge of the ship, and\r\nbevellings are taken from it both forward and abaft. The upper\r\nextremities of a vessel's floor-timbers, plumb to the quarter-beam.\r\n\r\nFLOOR-HOLLOW. The inflected curve of the floor, extending from the keel\r\nto the back of the floor-sweep, which the floor does not take.\r\n\r\nFLOOR-PLANS. In naval architecture, are longitudinal sections, whereon\r\nare represented the water-lines and ribband-lines.\r\n\r\nFLOOR-RIBBAND. This is an important fir-timber which runs round a little\r\nbelow the floor-heads, for the support of the floors.\r\n\r\nFLOOR-RIDERS. Knees brought in from side to side over the floor ceiling\r\nand kelson, to support the bottom, if bilged or weak, for heavy cargo.\r\n\r\nFLOORS, OR FLOOR-TIMBERS. Those parts of the ship's timbers which are\r\nplaced immediately across the keel, and upon which the bottom of the\r\nship is framed; to these the upper parts of the timbers are united,\r\nbeing only a continuation of floor-timbers upwards.\r\n\r\nFLOOR-SWEEPS. The radii that sweep the heads of the floors. The first in\r\nthe builder's draught, which is limited by a line in the body-plan,\r\nperpendicular to the plane of elevation, a little above the keel; and\r\nthe height of this line above the keel is called the _dead-rising_.\r\n\r\nFLOP, TO. To fall flat down: as \"soused flop in the lee-scuppers.\"\r\n\r\nFLORY-BOATS. A local term for boats employed in carrying passengers to\r\nand fro from steamers which cannot get alongside of a quay at low-water.\r\n\r\nFLOSH. A swamp overgrown with weeds.\r\n\r\nFLOSK.

Sometimes spelled\r\n_flotson_.\r\n\r\nFLOUNDER. A well-known pleuronect, better to fish for than to eat.\r\nCalled also _floun-dab_.\r\n\r\nFLOW. In tidology, the rising of the tide; the opposite of ebb. Also,\r\nthe course or direction of running waters.\r\n\r\nFLOWER OF THE WINDS. The mariner's compass on maps and charts.\r\n\r\nFLOWERING. The phenomenon observed usually in connection with the\r\nspawning of fish, at the distance of four leagues from shore. The water\r\nappears to be saturated with a thick jelly, filled with the ova of fish,\r\nwhich is known by its adhering to the ropes that the cobles anchor with\r\nwhile fishing, for they find the first six or seven fathom of rope free\r\nfrom spawn, the next ten or twelve covered with slimy matter, and the\r\nremainder again free to the bottom; this gelatinous material may supply\r\nthe new-born fry with food, and protect them by clouding the water.\r\n\r\nFLOWING-HOPE. _See_ FORLORN HOPE.\r\n\r\nFLOWING-SHEET. In sailing free or large, is the position of the sheets\r\nor lower clues of the principal sails when they are eased off to the\r\nwind, so as to receive it more nearly perpendicular than when they are\r\nclose-hauled, although more obliquely than when going before the wind; a\r\nship is therefore said to have a flowing-sheet, when the wind crosses\r\nthe line of her course nearly at right angles; that is to say, a ship\r\nsteering due north with the wind at east, or directly on her side, will\r\nhave a flowing-sheet; whereas, if the sheets were hauled close aft, she\r\nwould sail two points nearer the wind--viz. N.N.E. This explanation will\r\nprobably be better understood by considering the yards as plane faces of\r\nwedges--the more oblique fore and aft, the less head-way force is given,\r\nuntil 22 deg. before the transverse line or beam. This is the swiftest\r\nline of sailing. As the wind draws aft of the beam the speed decreases\r\n(unless the wind increases), so that a vessel with the wind abeam, and\r\nevery sail drawing, goes much faster than she would with the same wind\r\nbefore it.\r\n\r\nFLUCTUATION OF THE TIDE. The rising and falling of the waters.\r\n\r\nFLUE. _See_ FLUKES.\r\n\r\nFLUES. In a steamer's boiler, are a series of oblong passages from the\r\nfurnaces for the issue of heated air.

The two parts which constitute the large triangular tail of the\r\nwhale; from the power of these the phrase obtained among whalers of\r\n_fluking_ or _all-a-fluking_, when running with a fresh free wind.\r\nFlukes, or palms, are also the broad triangular plates of iron on each\r\narm of the anchor, inside the bills or extreme points, which having\r\nentered the ground, hold the ship. Seamen, by custom, drop the _k_, and\r\npronounce the word _flue_.\r\n\r\nFLUMMERY. A dish made of oatmeal, or oats soured, &c.\r\n\r\nFLURRY. The convulsive movements of a dying whale. Also, a light breeze\r\nof wind shifting to different points, and causing a little ruffling on\r\nthe sea. Also, hurry and confusion.\r\n\r\nFLUSH. An old word for even or level.

If an ensign, the part which extends from\r\nthe union to the outer part; the vertical height, to the head-toggle of\r\nwhich the halliards are bent, or which is next to the staff, is called\r\nthe _hoist_; the lower (which is a rope rove through the canvas heading,\r\nand into which the head-toggle is spliced) is the long tack; on this\r\nrope the whole strain is sustained.\r\n\r\nFLY, OR COMPASS-CARD, placed on the magnetic-needle and supported by a\r\npin, whereon it turns freely. (_See_ COMPASS.)\r\n\r\nFLY-AWAY. Fictitious resemblance of land; \"Dutchman's cape,\" &c. (_See_\r\nCAPE FLY-AWAY.)\r\n\r\nFLY-BLOCK. The block spliced into the topsail-tye; it is large and flat,\r\nand sometimes double.\r\n\r\nFLY-BOAT. A large flat-bottomed Dutch vessel, whose burden is generally\r\nfrom 300 to 600 tons. It is distinguished by a remarkably high stern,\r\nresembling a Gothic turret, and by very broad buttocks below. Also, a\r\nswift canal passage-boat.\r\n\r\nFLY-BY-NIGHT.

A famous marine spectre ship, formerly supposed to\r\nhaunt the Cape of Good Hope. The tradition of seamen was that a Dutch\r\nskipper, irritated with a foul wind, swore by _donner_ and _blitzen_,\r\nthat he would beat into Table Bay in spite of God or man, and that,\r\nfoundering with the wicked oath on his lips, he has ever since been\r\nworking off and on near the Cape. The term is now extended to false\r\nreports of vessels seen.\r\n\r\nFLYING JIB. A light sail set before the jib, on the flying jib-boom.

Nautical usury, bottomry.\r\n\r\nFOG. A mist at sea, consisting of the grosser vapours floating in the\r\nair near the surface of the sea. The fog of the great bank of\r\nNewfoundland is caused by the near proximity of warm and cold waters.\r\nThe air over the Gulf Stream, being warmer than that over the banks of\r\nNewfoundland, is capable of keeping much more moisture in invisible\r\nsuspension; and when this air comes in contact with that above the cold\r\nwater, it parts with some of its moisture, or rather holds it in visible\r\nsuspension. There are also dry fogs, which are dust held in suspension,\r\nas the so-called African dust, which often partially obscures the sun,\r\nand reddens the sails of ships as they pass through the north-east\r\ntrades.\r\n\r\nFOG-BANK. A dense haze, presenting the appearance of a thick cloud\r\nresting upon the horizon; it is known in high latitudes as the precursor\r\nof wind from the quarter in which it appears. From its frequent\r\nresemblance to land it has obtained the name of _Cape Fly-away_.\r\n\r\nFOG-BOW. A beautiful natural phenomenon incidental to high latitudes. It\r\nappears opposite to the sun, and is usually broad and white, but\r\nsometimes assumes the prismatic colours. Indicative of clearing off of\r\nmists. (_See_ FOG-EATER.)\r\n\r\nFOG-DOGS. Those transient prismatic breaks which occur in thick mists,\r\nand considered good symptoms of the weather clearing.\r\n\r\nFOG-EATER. A synonym of _fog-dog_ and _fog-bow_. It may be explained as\r\nthe clearing of the upper stratum, permitting the sun's rays to exhibit\r\nat the horizon prismatic colours; hence \"sun-gall.\"\r\n\r\nFOGEY. An old-fashioned or singular person; an invalid soldier or\r\nsailor. Often means a stupid but irascible fellow.\r\n\r\nFOGGY. Not quite sober.\r\n\r\nFOGRAM.

Also, the young gentlemen introduced into the service by the\r\ncaptain, and reared with a father's care, moving with him from ship to\r\nship; a practice which produced most of our best officers formerly, but\r\ninnovation has broken through it, to the serious detriment of the\r\nservice and the country.\r\n\r\nFOLLOWING, NORTH OR SOUTH. _See_ QUADRANT.\r\n\r\nFOMALHAUT. A standard nautical star, called also {a} _Piscis australis_.\r\n\r\nFOOL. \"He's no fool on a march,\" a phrase meaning that such a person is\r\nequal to what he undertakes.\r\n\r\nFOOLEN.

Also, the force of\r\neach ship stated agreeably to the old usage in the navy, according to\r\nthe number of guns actually carried. In these days of iron-clads,\r\nturret-ships, and heavy guns, this does not give a true estimate of a\r\nship's force. Also, the general force, ships, men, soldiers, &c.,\r\nengaged in any expedition; as expeditionary force.--Also, _force of\r\nwind_, now described by numbers, 0 being calm, 12 the heaviest\r\ngale.--_To force_, is to take by storm; to force a passage by driving\r\nback the enemy.--Colloquially, no force--gently.\r\n\r\nFORCED MARCH.

It is now applied\r\nin men-of-war to that part of the upper deck forward of the after\r\nfore-shroud, or main-tack block, and which is flush with the\r\nquarter-deck and gangways. Also, a forward part of a merchantman under\r\nthe deck, where the seamen live on a platform.

As the\r\nlower arm of the fore-foot lies on the same level with the keel, so the\r\nupper one coincides with the middle line of the stem; its breadth and\r\nthickness therefore correspond with the dimensions of those pieces, and\r\nthe heel of the cut-water is scarphed to its upper end. Also, an\r\nimaginary line of the ship's course or direction.\r\n\r\nFORE-GANGER OF THE CHAIN BOWER CABLES.

A precursor, an avant-courier.\r\n\r\nFORERUNNERS OF THE LOG-LINE. A small piece of red bunting laid into that\r\nline at a certain distance from the log, the space between them being\r\ncalled the stray-line, which is usually from 12 to 15 fathoms, and is an\r\nallowance for the log to be entirely out of the ship's dead-water before\r\nthey begin to estimate the ship's velocity, consequently the knots begin\r\nfrom that point. (_See_ LOG-LINE.)\r\n\r\nFORE-SAIL. The principal sail set on the fore-mast. (_See_ SAIL.)\r\n\r\nFORE-SHEET HORSE.

Those who reside in sea-ports for the sake of stealing dockyard\r\nstores, or buying them, knowing them to be stolen.\r\n\r\nFORLORN HOPE. Officers and men detached on desperate service to make a\r\nfirst attack, or to be the first in mounting a breach, or foremost in\r\nstorming a fortress, or first to receive the whole fire of the enemy.\r\nForlorn-hopes was a term formerly applied to the videttes of the army.\r\nThis ominous name (the _enfants perdus_ of the French) is familiarized\r\ninto a better one among soldiers, who call it the _flowing-hope_.\r\nPromotion is usually bestowed on the survivors.\r\n\r\nFORMATION. The drawing up or arrangement of troops, or small-arm men, in\r\ncertain orders prescribed as the basis of man[oe]uvres in general. Also,\r\nthe particulars of a ship's build.\r\n\r\nFORMER. The gunner's term for a small cylindrical piece of wood, on\r\nwhich musket or pistol cartridge-cases are rolled and formed. The name\r\nis also applied to the flat piece of wood with a hole in the centre used\r\nfor making wads, but which is properly _form_.\r\n\r\nFORMICAS. Clusters of small rocks [from the Italian for ants]. Also,\r\nHormigas [Sp.]\r\n\r\nFORMING THE LINE. _See_ LINE.\r\n\r\nFORMING THE ORDER OF SAILING. _See_ SAILING, ORDER OF.\r\n\r\nFORMS.

The art by which a place is so fortified that a given\r\nnumber of men occupying it may advantageously oppose a superior force.\r\nThe same word also signifies the works that cover and defend a place.\r\nFortification is _defensive_ when surrounding a place so as to render it\r\ncapable of defence against besiegers; and _offensive_ when comprehending\r\nthe various works for conducting a siege. It is _natural_ when it\r\nopposes rocks, woods, marshes, ravines, &c., to impede the progress of\r\nan enemy; and _artificial_, when raised by human ingenuity to aid the\r\nadvantages of the ground. The latter is again subdivided into\r\n_permanent_ and _field_ fortification: the one being constructed at\r\nleisure and of permanent materials, the other raised only for temporary\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\nFORTIFYING. The strengthening a ship for especial emergency, by doubling\r\nplanks, chocks, and additional timbers and knees, strongly secured.\r\n\r\nFORT-MAJOR.

A name given to forty line-of-battle ships ordered by the\r\nAdmiralty at one fell swoop, to be built by contract, towards the end of\r\nthe Napoleon war, and which turned out badly. The writer served in one,\r\nthe _Rodney 74_, which fully exposed her weakness in the first gale she\r\nexperienced, and was sent home, thereby weakening the blockading fleet.\r\nMany never went to sea as ships of the line, but were converted into\r\ngood frigates.\r\n\r\nFORWARD. In the fore-part of the ship; the same as _afore_. Also, the\r\nword of command when troops are to resume their march after a temporary\r\ninterruption.\r\n\r\nFORWARD THERE! The hail to the forecastle.\r\n\r\nFOSSE [Ital.] Synonymous with _moat_ or _ditch_.\r\n\r\nFOTHER [Anglo-Saxon _foder_]. A burden; a weight of lead equal to 19-1/2\r\ncwts. Leaden pigs for ballast.\r\n\r\nFOTHERING. Is usually practised to stop a leak at sea. A heavy sail, as\r\nthe sprit-sail, is closely thrummed with yarn and oakum, and drawn under\r\nthe bottom: the pressure of the water drives the thrumming into the\r\napertures. If one does not succeed others are added, using all the sails\r\nrather than lose the ship.\r\n\r\nFOUGADE, OR FOUGASS. A small charged mine, from 6 to 8 feet under a post\r\nin danger of falling into the enemy's hands.\r\n\r\nFOUL. Generally used in opposition to _clear_, and implies entangled,\r\nembarrassed, or contrary to: as \"a ship ran foul of us,\" that is,\r\nentangled herself among our rigging. Also, to contaminate in any way.\r\n\r\nFOUL AIR. May be generated by circumstances beyond control: decomposing\r\nfungi, timber injected with coal tar, hatches battened down, and ashes\r\nor coal washed about. Whole crews on the coast of Africa, and in the\r\nWest Indies, have been thus swept away, despite every precaution. But\r\ngenerally it may be avoided by cleanliness.\r\n\r\nFOUL ANCHOR. An anchor is said to be _foul_, or _fouled_, either when it\r\nhooks some impediment under water, or when the ship, by the wind\r\nshifting, entangles her slack cable a turn round the stock, or round the\r\nupper fluke thereof. The last, from its being avoidable by a sharp\r\nlook-out, is termed the seaman's disgrace.\r\n\r\nFOUL BERTH. When a ship anchors in the hawse of another she gives the\r\nlatter a foul berth; or she may anchor on one tide so near as to swing\r\nfoul on the change either of wind or tide.\r\n\r\nFOUL BILL. _See_ BILL OF HEALTH.\r\n\r\nFOUL BOTTOM.

Principally in field fortification, palisades placed\r\nhorizontally, or nearly so, along the crest of the escarp, or sometimes\r\nof the counterscarp; being generally concealed from direct artillery\r\nfire they very materially increase the difficulty of either of those\r\nslopes to an assailant. They project some 5 feet above the surface, and\r\nare buried for about the same length in the ground.\r\n\r\nFRAME. The outer frame timbers of a vessel consist of the keel, stem,\r\nstern-posts, and ribs, which when moulded and bolted form the frame.\r\n(_See_ TIMBERS.)\r\n\r\nFRAME OF THE MARINE STEAM-ENGINE, is the strong supporter of the\r\npaddle-shafts and intermediate shaft; it rests on columns, and is firmly\r\nbolted to the engine bottom.\r\n\r\nFRAMES. The bends of timbers constituting the shape of the ship's\r\nbody--when completed a ship is said to be _in frame_.\r\n\r\nFRAME-TIMBERS.

To secure the falls of a tackle together by means\r\nof spun yarn, rope yarn, or any lashing wound round them. To snap the\r\nfinger and thumb; to beat.\r\n\r\nFRAPPING. The act of crossing and drawing together the several parts of\r\na tackle, or other complication of ropes, which had already been\r\nstrained to a great extent; in this sense it exactly resembles the\r\noperation of bracing up a drum. The frapping increases tension, and\r\nconsequently adds to the security acquired by the purchase; hence the\r\ncat-harpings were no other than frappings to the shrouds.\r\n\r\nFRAPPING A SHIP. The act of passing four or five turns of a large\r\ncable-laid rope round a ship's hull when it is apprehended that she is\r\nnot strong enough to resist the violence of the sea. This expedient is\r\nonly made use of for very old ships, which their owners venture to send\r\nto sea as long as possible, insuring them deeply. Such are termed, not\r\nunaptly, floating coffins, as were also the old, 10-gun brigs, or any\r\nvessel deemed doubtful as to sea-worthiness. St. Paul's ship was\r\n\"undergirded\" or frapped.\r\n\r\nFRAPPING TURNS. In securing the booms at sea the several turns of the\r\nlashings are frapped in preparation for the succeeding turns; in\r\nemergency, nailed.\r\n\r\nFRAUDS, ACT OF.

A vessel is said to be _going free_ when the bowlines are slacked\r\nand the sheets eased; beyond this is termed large. (_See_ SAILING\r\nLARGE.)\r\n\r\nFREE-BOARD. _See_ PLANK-SHEER.\r\n\r\nFREEING. The act of pumping, or otherwise throwing out the water which\r\nhas leaked into a ship's bottom. When all the water is pumped or baled\r\nout, the vessel is said to be free. Said of the wind when it exceeds 67\r\ndeg. 30' from right-ahead.\r\n\r\nFREE PORT. Ports open to all comers free of entry-dues, as places of\r\ncall, not delivery.\r\n\r\nFREE SHIP.

Thus sea-water freezes at 28\r\ndeg. 5' Fah.; fresh water at 32 deg.; mercury at 39 deg. 5' below zero.\r\nAll fluids change their degree of freezing in accordance with mixtures of\r\nalcohol or solutions of salt used for the purpose. Also, according to the\r\natmospheric pressure; and by this law heights of mountains are measured\r\nby the boiling temperature of water.\r\n\r\nFREIGHT. By former English maritime law it became the _mother of wages_,\r\nas the crew were obliged to moor the ship on her return in the docks or\r\nforfeit them. So severely was the axiom maintained, that if a ship was\r\nlost by misfortune, tempest, enemy, or fire, wages also were forfeited,\r\nbecause the freight out of which they were to arise had perished with\r\nit. This harsh measure was intended to augment the care of the seamen\r\nfor the welfare of the ship, but no longer holds, for by the merchant\r\nshipping act it is enacted that no right of wages shall be dependent on\r\nthe earning of freight; in cases of wreck, however, proof that a man has\r\nnot done his utmost bars his claim. Also, for the burden or lading of a\r\nship. (_See_ DEAD-FREIGHT.) Also, a duty of 50 sols per ton formerly\r\npaid to the government of France by the masters of foreign vessels going\r\nin or out of the several ports of that kingdom. All vessels not built in\r\nFrance were accounted foreign unless two-thirds of the crew were French.\r\nThe Dutch and the Hanse towns were exempted from this duty of\r\nfreight.--_To freight a vessel_, means to employ her for the carriage of\r\ngoods and passengers.\r\n\r\nFREIGHT OF A SHIP. The hire, or part thereof, usually paid for the\r\ncarriage and conveyance of goods by sea; or the sum agreed upon between\r\nthe owner and the merchant for the hire and use of a vessel, at the rate\r\nof so much for the voyage, or by the month, or per ton.\r\n\r\nFREIGHTER. The party who hires a vessel or part of a vessel for the\r\ncarriage of goods.\r\n\r\nFREIGHTING. A letting out of vessels on freight or hire; one of the\r\nprincipal practices in the trade of the Dutch.\r\n\r\nFRENCH FAKE. A name for what is merely a modification of the Flemish\r\ncoil, both being extremely good for the object, that is, when a rope has\r\nto be let go suddenly, and is required to run freely. _Fake_, in\r\ncontradistinction to long coil is, run a rope backward and forward in\r\none-fathom bends, beside each other, so that it may run free, as in\r\nrocket-lines, to communicate with stranded vessels. (_See_ FLEMISH\r\nFAKE.)\r\n\r\nFRENCH LAKE. A soubriquet for the Mediterranean.\r\n\r\nFRENCH LEAVE. Being absent without permission.\r\n\r\nFRENCHMAN.

A brisk wind, to which a ship, according to its stability,\r\ncarries double or treble or close-reefed top-sails, &c. This is a very\r\npeculiar term, dependent on the stability of the ship, her management,\r\nand how she is affected by it, on a wind or before it. It is numbered 6.\r\nThus, a ship running down the trades, with studding-sails set, had\r\nregistered \"moderate and fine;\" she met with a superior officer,\r\nclose-hauled under close-reefed top-sails and courses, was compelled to\r\nshorten sail, and lower her boat; the log was then marked \"fresh\r\nbreezes.\"\r\n\r\nFRESHEN, TO. To relieve a rope of its strain, or danger of chafing, by\r\nshifting or removing its place of nip.\r\n\r\nFRESHEN HAWSE, TO. To relieve that part of the cable which has for some\r\ntime been exposed to friction in one of the hawse-holes, when the ship\r\nrolls and pitches at anchor in a high sea; this is done by applying\r\nfresh service to the cable within board, and then veering it into the\r\nhawse. (_See_ SERVICE, KECKLING, or ROUNDING.)\r\n\r\nFRESHEN THE BALLAST. Divide or separate it, so as to alter its position.\r\n\r\nFRESHEN THE NIP, TO. To veer a small portion of cable through the\r\nhawse-hole, or heave a little in, in order to let another part of it\r\nbear the stress and friction.

When the ship feels the increasing influence of a breeze.\r\nAlso, when a man quickens his pace.\r\n\r\nFRESHES. Imply the impetuosity of an ebb tide, increased by heavy rains,\r\nand flowing out into the sea, which it often discolours to a\r\nconsiderable distance from the shore, as with the Nile, the Congo, the\r\nMississippi, the Indus, the Ganges, the Rhone, Surinam, &c.\r\n\r\nFRESHET. A word long used for pools or ponds, when swollen after rain or\r\ntemporary inundations. It is also applied to a pond supplied by a\r\nspring.\r\n\r\nFRESH GALE. A more powerful wind than a _fresh breeze_ (which see).\r\n\r\nFRESH GRUB. The refreshments obtained in harbour.\r\n\r\nFRESH HAND AT THE BELLOWS.

A name given to the extensive inland bodies of fresh\r\nwater in the Canadas. Of these, Lake Superior is upwards of 1500 miles\r\nin circuit, with a depth of 70 fathoms near the shores, while Michigan\r\nand Huron are almost as prodigious; even Erie is 600 miles round, and\r\nOntario near 500, and Nepigon, the head of the system geographically,\r\nthough the least important at present commercially, but just now\r\npartially explored, is fully 400. Their magnitude, however, appears\r\nlikely to be rivalled geographically by the lakes lately discovered in\r\nCentral Africa, the Victoria Nyanza and the Albert Nyanza.\r\n\r\nFRESH WAY. Increased speed through the water; a ship is said to \"gather\r\nfresh way\" when she has tacked, or hove-to, and then fills her sails.\r\n\r\nFRET.

The West Indian name for the swell called _rollers_, or in\r\nJamaica the _north sea_. It occurs in a calm, and with no other\r\nindication of a previous gale; the sea rises in huge billows, dashes\r\nagainst the shore with roarings resembling thunder, probably due to the\r\n\"northers,\" which suddenly rage off the capes of Virginia, round to the\r\nGulf of Mexico, and drive off the sea from America, affecting the Bahama\r\nBanks, but not reaching to Jamaica or Cuba. The rollers set in\r\nterrifically in the Gulf of California, causing vessels to founder or\r\nstrike in 7 fathoms, and devastating the coast-line.

The excrement of sea-birds, a valuable manure found in thick\r\nbeds on certain islets on the coast of Peru, indeed, in all tropical\r\nclimates. The transport of it occupies a number of vessels, called\r\n_guaneros_. It is of a dingy yellow colour, and offensive ammoniacal\r\neffluvium. Captain Shelvocke mentions it in 1720, having taken a small\r\nbark laden with it.\r\n\r\nGUARA.

A capacious bay, and sometimes taking the name of a sea\r\nwhen it is very extensive; such are the Euxine or Black Sea, otherwise\r\ncalled the Gulf of Constantinople; the Adriatic Sea, called also the\r\nGulf of Venice; the Mediterranean is itself a prodigious specimen. A\r\ngulf is, strictly speaking, distinguished from a sea in being smaller,\r\nand from a bay in being larger and deeper than it is broad. It is\r\nobserved that the sea is always most dangerous near gulfs, from the\r\ncurrents being penned up by the shores.\r\n\r\nGULF-STREAM. Is especially referable to that of Mexico, the waters of\r\nwhich flow in a warm stream at various velocities over the banks between\r\nCuba and America, past the Bermudas, touch the tail of the great bank of\r\nNewfoundland, and thence in a sweep to Europe, part going north, and the\r\nother southerly down to the tropics again.\r\n\r\nGULF-WEED. The _Fucus natans_, considered to belong to the Gulf Stream,\r\nand found floating in the Sargasso Sea in the North Atlantic. Many small\r\ncrustacea live amongst it, and assume its bright orange-yellow hue.\r\n\r\nGUL-GUL. A sort of chunam or cement made of pounded sea-shells mixed\r\nwith oil, which hardens like a stone, and is put over a ship's bottom in\r\nIndia, so that worms cannot penetrate even when the copper is off.\r\n\r\nGULL. A well-known sea-bird of the genus _Larus_; there are many\r\nspecies. Also, a large trout in the north. The name is, moreover,\r\nfamiliarly used for a lout easily deceived or cheated; thus Butler in\r\n_Hudibras_--\r\n\r\n    \"The paltry story is untrue,\r\n    And forg'd to cheat such gulls as you.\"\r\n\r\nIt is also applied to the washing away of earth by the violent flowing\r\nof water; the origin perhaps of the Kentish gull-stream.\r\n\r\nGULLET. A small stream in a water-worn course.\r\n\r\nGULL-SHARPER. One who preys upon Johnny Raws.\r\n\r\nGULLY. The channels worn on the face of mountains by heavy rains.

Monte Desolado\r\ngusts have dismantled many stout ships.\r\n\r\nGULPIN. An awkward soldier; a weak credulous fellow [from the Gaelic\r\n_golben_, a novice].\r\n\r\nGUM. \"Shaking the gum out of a sail\" is said of the effect of bad\r\nweather on new canvas.\r\n\r\nGUMPUS. A fish, called also _numscull_, for allowing itself to be\r\nguddled.\r\n\r\nGUN. The usual service name for a _cannon_ (which see); it was\r\noriginally called great gun, to distinguish it from the small or hand\r\nguns, muskets, blunderbusses, &c. The general construction for guns of\r\ncast metal is fairly represented by the old rule that the circumference\r\nat the breech ought to measure eleven calibres, at the trunnions nine,\r\nand at the muzzle seven, for iron; and in each instance two calibres\r\nless for brass guns. But the introduction of wrought-iron guns, built up\r\nwith outer jackets of metal shrunk on one above another, is developing\r\nother names and proportions in the new artillery. (_See_ BUILT-UP GUNS.)\r\nThe weight of these latter, though differently disposed, and required\r\nnot so much for strength as for modifying the recoil or shock to the\r\ncarriage on discharge, is not very much less, proportionally, for heavy\r\nguns of full power, than that of the old ones, being about 1-1/4 cwt. of\r\ngun for every 1 lb. of shot; for light guns for field purposes it is\r\nabout 3/4 cwt. for every 1 lb. of shot. Guns are generally designated\r\nfrom the weight of the shot they discharge, though some few natures,\r\nintroduced principally for firing shells, were distinguished by the\r\ndiameter of their bore in inches; with the larger guns of the new\r\nsystem, in addition to this diameter, the weight in tons is also\r\nspecified.--_Gun_, in north-country cant, meant a large flagon of ale,\r\nand _son of a gun_ was a jovial toper: the term, owed its derivation to\r\nlads born under the breast of the lower-deck guns in olden times, when\r\nwomen were allowed to accompany their husbands. Even in 1820 the best\r\npetty officers were allowed this indulgence, about one to every hundred\r\nmen. Gunners also, who superintended the youngsters, took their wives,\r\nand many living admirals can revert to kindness experienced from them.\r\nThese \"sons of a gun\" were tars, and no mistake.--_Morning gun_, a\r\nsignal fired by an admiral or commodore at day-break every morning for\r\nthe drums or bugles to sound the reveille. A gun of like name and nature\r\nis generally in use in fortresses; as is also the _evening gun_, fired\r\nby an admiral or commodore at 9 P.M. in summer, and 8 P.M. in winter,\r\nevery night, on which the drums or bugles sound the retreat.\r\n\r\nGUN AND HEAD MONEY. Given to the captors of an enemy's ship of war\r\ndestroyed, or deserted, in fight. It was formerly assumed to be about\r\nL1000 per gun.\r\n\r\nGUNBOAT. A light-draught boat fitted to carry one or more cannon in the\r\nbow, so as to cannonade an enemy while she is end-on. They are\r\nprincipally useful in fine weather, to cover the landing of troops, or\r\nsuch other occasions. They were formerly impelled by sails and sweeps\r\nbut now by steam-power, which has generally increased their size, and\r\nmuch developed their importance. According to Froissart, cannon were\r\nfired from boats in the fourteenth century.\r\n\r\nGUN-CHAMBERS. In early artillery, a movable chamber with a handle, like\r\na paterero, used in loading at the breech. In more recent times the name\r\nhas been used for the small portable mortars for firing salutes in the\r\nparks.\r\n\r\nGUN-COTTON. An explosive compound, having some advantages over\r\ngunpowder, but so irregular hitherto in its action that it is at present\r\nused only for mining purposes. It consists of ordinary cotton treated\r\nwith nitric and sulphuric acid and water, and has been named by chemists\r\n\"pyroxylin,\" \"nitro-cellulose,\" &c.\r\n\r\nGUN-DECK. _See_ DECKS.\r\n\r\nGUN-FIRE. The morning or evening guns, familiarly termed \"the admiral\r\nfalling down the hatchway.\"\r\n\r\nGUN-GEAR.

A vessel filled with combustibles, but rather for explosion\r\nthan as a fire-ship.\r\n\r\nGUN-METAL. The alloy from which brass guns are cast consists of 100\r\nparts of copper to 10 of tin, retaining much of the tenacity of the\r\nformer, and much harder than either of the components; but the late\r\nimproved working of wrought-iron and steel has nearly superseded its\r\napplication to guns.\r\n\r\nGUNNADE. A short 32-pounder gun of 6 feet, introduced in 1814;\r\nafterwards termed the shell-gun.\r\n\r\nGUNNEL. _See_ GUNWALE.\r\n\r\nGUNNELL. A spotted ribbon-bodied fish, living under stones and among\r\nrocks.\r\n\r\nGUNNER, OF A SHIP OF WAR. A warrant-officer appointed to take charge of\r\nthe ammunition and artillery on board; to keep the latter properly fitted,\r\nand to instruct the sailors in the exercise of the cannon. The warrant of\r\nchief-gunner is now given to first-class gunners.--_Quarter-gunners._\r\nMen formerly placed under the direction of the gunner, one quarter-gunner\r\nbeing allowed to every four guns. In the army, gunner is the proper title\r\nof a private soldier of the Royal Artillery, with the exception of those\r\nstyled drivers.\r\n\r\nGUNNER-FLOOK. A name among our northern fishermen for the _Pleuronectes\r\nmaximus_, or turbot.\r\n\r\nGUNNER'S DAUGHTER.

A ship fitted for training men in the practice of\r\ncharging, pointing, and firing guns and mortars for the Royal Navy.\r\n(_See_ SEAMEN-GUNNERS.)\r\n\r\nGUNNING. An old term for shooting; it is now adopted by the Americans.\r\nAfter the wreck of the _Wager_, on hearing the pistols fired at Cozens,\r\n\"it was rainy weather, and not fit for gunning, so that we could not\r\nimagine the meaning of it.\"--_Gunning a ship._ Fitting her with\r\nordnance.--_Gunning_, in mining, is when the blast explodes and does not\r\nrend the mass.--_Gunning_, signals enforced by guns.\r\n\r\nGUNNING-BOAT, OR GUNNING-SHOUT.

The sacks used on the India station for holding rice,\r\nbiscuit, &c.; often as sand-bags in fortification.\r\n\r\nGUN-PENDULUM. _See_ BALLISTIC PENDULUM.\r\n\r\nGUN-PORTS. _See_ PORTS.\r\n\r\nGUNPOWDER. The well-known explosive composition which, for its\r\nregularity of effect and convenience in manufacture and use, is still\r\npreferred for general purposes to all the new and more violent but more\r\ncapricious agents. In England it is composed of 75 parts saltpetre to 10\r\nsulphur and 15 charcoal; these proportions are varied slightly in\r\ndifferent countries. The ingredients are mixed together with great\r\nmechanical nicety, and the compound is then pressed and granulated. On\r\nthe application of fire it is converted into gas with vast explosive\r\npower, but subject to tolerably well-known laws.\r\n\r\nGUN-ROOM. A compartment on the after-end of the lower gun-deck of large\r\nships of war, partly occupied by the junior officers; but in smaller\r\nvessels it is below the gun-deck, and the mess-room of the lieutenants.\r\n\r\nGUNROOM-PORTS. In frigates, stern-ports cut through the gun-room.\r\n\r\nGUN-SEARCHER. An iron instrument with several sharp-pointed prongs and a\r\nwooden handle: it is used to find whether the bore is honey-combed.\r\n\r\nGUN-SHOT. Formerly, the distance up to which a gun would throw a shot\r\ndirect to its mark, without added elevation; as the \"line of metal\"\r\n(which see) was generally used in laying, this range was about 800\r\nyards. But now that ranges are so greatly increased, with but slight\r\nadditions to the elevation, the term will include the distances of\r\nordinary \"horizontal fire\" (which see); as between ships, with rifled\r\nguns, it will not quite reach two miles: though when the mark is large,\r\nas a town or dockyard, it is still within long range at five miles'\r\ndistance.\r\n\r\nGUN-SIGHT. _See_ DISPART, or SIGHTS.\r\n\r\nGUN-SLINGS. Long rope grommets used for hoisting in and mounting them.\r\n\r\nGUN-STONES. An old term for cannon-balls, from stones having been first\r\nsupplied to the ordnance and used for that purpose. Shakspeare makes\r\nHenry V. tell the French ambassadors that their master's tennis-balls\r\nshall be changed to gun-stones. This term was retained for a bullet,\r\nafter the introduction of iron shot.\r\n\r\nGUN-TACKLE PURCHASE. A tackle composed of a rope rove through two single\r\nblocks, the standing part being made fast to the strop of one of the\r\nblocks. It multiplies the power applied threefold.\r\n\r\nGUNTEN. A boat of burden in the Moluccas.\r\n\r\nGUNTER'S LINE. Called also the _line of numbers_, and the _line of\r\nlines_, is placed upon scales and sectors, and named from its inventor,\r\nEdmund Gunter. It is a logarithmic scale of proportionals, wherein the\r\ndistance between each division is equal to the number of mean\r\nproportionals contained between the two terms, in such parts as the\r\ndistance between 1 and 10 is 10,000, &c.\r\n\r\nGUNTER'S QUADRANT. A kind of stereographic projection on the plane of\r\nthe equinoctial; the eye is supposed in one of the poles, so that the\r\ntropic, ecliptic, and horizon form the arches of the circles, but the\r\nhour-circles are all curves, drawn by means of several altitudes of the\r\nsun, for some particular latitude, for every day in the year. The use of\r\nthis instrument is to find the hour of the day, the sun's azimuth, and\r\nother common problems of the globe; as also to take the altitude of an\r\nobject in degrees.\r\n\r\nGUNWALE, OR GUNNEL. Nearly synonymous with _plank-sheer_ (which see);\r\nbut its strict application is that horizontal plank which covers the\r\nheads of the timbers between the main and fore drifts. The _gunwale of a\r\nboat_ is a piece of timber going round the upper sheer-strake as a\r\nbinder for its top-work.--_Gunwale-to._ Vessels heeling over, so that\r\nthe gunwale is even with the water. When a boat sails with a free wind,\r\nand rolls each side, or gunwale, to the water's edge, she rolls\r\ngunwale-to.\r\n\r\nGURGE. A gulf or whirlpool.\r\n\r\nGURNARD. A fish of the genus _Trigla_, so called from its peculiar grunt\r\nwhen removed from the water. Falstaff uses the term \"soused gurnet\" in a\r\nmost contemptuous view, owing to its poorness; and its head being all\r\nskin and bone gave rise to the saying that the flesh on a gurnard's head\r\nis rank poison.\r\n\r\nGURNET-PENDANT. A rope, the thimble of which is hooked to the\r\nquarter-tackle of the main-yard; it is led through a hole in the deck,\r\nfor the purpose of raising the breech of a gun, when hoisting in, to the\r\nlevel required to place it on its carriage.\r\n\r\nGUSSOCK. An east-country term for a strong and sudden gust of wind.\r\n\r\nGUST, OR GUSH. A sudden violent wind experienced near mountainous lands;\r\nit is of short duration, and generally succeeded by fine breezes.\r\n\r\nGUT. A somewhat coarse term for the main part of a strait or channel, as\r\nthe Gut of Gibraltar, Gut of Canso.\r\n\r\nGUTTER [Anglo-Saxon _geotan_, to pour out or shed]. A ditch, sluice, or\r\ngote.\r\n\r\nGUTTER-LEDGE. A cross-bar laid along the middle of a large hatchway in\r\nsome vessels, to support the covers and enable them the better to\r\nsustain any weighty body.\r\n\r\nGUY. A rope used to steady a weighty body from swinging against the\r\nship's side while it is hoisting or lowering, particularly when, there\r\nis a high sea.

They\r\nare framed by the bending of a rough piece of wood into the form of a\r\nwreath, and fastened at the two ends by means of notches, thereby\r\nretaining their circular figure and elasticity; whereas the grommets\r\nwhich are formed of rope are apt to relax in warm weather, and adhere to\r\nthe stays, so as to prevent the sails from being readily hoisted or\r\nlowered.--_Iron hanks_ are more generally used now that stays are made\r\nof wire.--_Hank_ is also a skein of line or twine.--_Getting into a\r\nhank_, irritated by jokes.\r\n\r\nHANSE-TOWNS.

An old modification of the harpoon.\r\n\r\nHARPENS. _See_ HARPINGS.\r\n\r\nHARPER-CRAB. _See_ TOMMY HARPER.\r\n\r\nHARPINGS, OR HARPENS. The fore-parts of the wales which encompass the\r\nbow of a ship, and are fastened to the stem, being thicker than the\r\nafter-part of the wales, in order to strengthen the ship in that place\r\nwhere she sustains the greatest shock of resistance in plunging into the\r\nsea, or dividing it, under a great pressure of sail. Also, the pieces of\r\noak, similar to ribbands, but trimmed and bolted to the shape of the\r\nbody of the ship, which hold the fore and after cant bodies together,\r\nuntil the ship is planked. But this term is mostly applicable to those\r\nat the bow; hence arises the phrase \"clean and full harpings.\" Harpings\r\nin the bow of a vessel are decried as rendering the ship uneasy.--_Cat\r\nharpings._ The legs which cross from futtock-staff to futtock-staff,\r\nbelow the tops, to girt in the rigging, and allow the lower yards to\r\nbrace sharp up.\r\n\r\nHARPOON, OR HARPAGO. A spear or javelin with a barbed point, used to\r\nstrike whales and other fish. The harpoon is furnished with a long\r\nshank, and has at one end a broad and flat triangular head, sharpened at\r\nboth edges so as to penetrate the whale with facility, but blunt behind\r\nto prevent its cutting out. To the other end a fore-ganger is bent, to\r\nwhich is fastened a long cord called the whale-line, which lies\r\ncarefully coiled in the boat in such a manner as to run out without\r\nbeing interrupted or entangled. Several coils, each 130 fathoms of\r\nwhale-line (soft laid and of clean silky fibre) are in readiness; the\r\ninstant the whale is struck the men cant the oars, so that the roll may\r\nnot immerse them in the water. The line, which has a turn round the\r\nbollard, flies like lightning, and is intensely watched. One man pours\r\nwater on the smoking bollard, another is ready with a sharp axe to cut,\r\nand the others see that the lines run free. Seven or eight coils have\r\nbeen run out before the whale \"sounds,\" or strikes bottom, when he rises\r\nagain to breathe, and probably gets a similar dose.--_Gun harpoon._ A\r\nweapon used for the same purpose as the preceding, but it is fired out\r\nof a gun, instead of being thrown by hand; it is made entirely of steel,\r\nand has a chain or long shackle attached to it, to which the whale-line\r\nis fastened. Greener's harpoon-gun is a kind of wall-piece fixed in a\r\ncrutch, which steps into the bow-bollard of the whale-boat. The harpoon\r\nprojects about four inches beyond the muzzle. It consists of its barbed\r\npoint attached to a long link, with a solid button at its opposite end\r\nto fit the gun; on one rod of this link is a ring which runs to the\r\nmuzzle, and is there attached to the whale-line by a thong of seal or\r\nwalrus hide, wet. The gun being fired, the harpoon is projected, the\r\nring sliding up to the button, when the line follows. Some of these\r\nharpoons or other engines have grenades--glass globules with prussic\r\nacid or other chemicals--which sicken the whale instantly, and little\r\ntrouble ensues.\r\n\r\nHARPOONER, HARPONEER, OR HARPINEER. The expert bowman in a whale-boat,\r\nwhose duty it is to throw or fire the harpoon.\r\n\r\nHARP-SEAL.

A square or oblong opening in the middle of the deck of a\r\nship, of which there are generally three--the fore, main, and\r\nafter--affording passages up and down from one deck to another, and\r\nagain descending into the hold. The coverings over these openings are\r\ncalled hatches. Goods of bulk are let down into the hold by the\r\nhatchways. To lay anything in the hatchway, is to put it so that the\r\nhatches cannot be approached or opened. The hatches of a smaller kind\r\nare distinguished by the name of _scuttles_.\r\n\r\nHATCHWAY-NETTINGS. Nettings sometimes placed over the hatchways instead\r\nof gratings, for security and circulation of air. They arrest the fall\r\nof any one from a deck above.\r\n\r\nHATCHWAY-SCREENS.

It is\r\nalso generally understood to imply the situation of the cables before\r\nthe ship's stem, when she is moored with two anchors out from forward,\r\none on the starboard, and the other on the port bow. It also denotes any\r\nsmall distance between her head and the anchors employed to ride her, as\r\n\"he has anchored in our hawse,\" \"the brig fell athwart our hawse,\" &c.\r\nAlso, said of a vessel a little in advance of the stem; as, she sails\r\n_athwart hawse_, or has anchored _in the hawse_. If a vessel drives at\r\nher anchors into the hawse of another she is said to \"_foul the hawse_\"\r\nof the vessel riding there; hence the threat of a man-of-war's-man, \"If\r\nyou foul my hawse, I'll cut your cable,\" no merchant vessel being\r\nallowed to approach a ship-of-war within certain limits, and never to\r\nmake fast to the government buoys.--_A bold hawse_ is when the holes are\r\nhigh above the water. \"Freshen hawse,\" or \"veer out more cable,\" is said\r\nwhen part of the cable that lies in the hawse is fretted or chafed, and\r\nmore should be veered out, so that another part of it may rest in the\r\nhawse. \"Freshen hawse\" also means, clap a service on or round the cable\r\nin the hawses to prevent it from fretting; hemp cables only are rounded\r\nor cackled. Also, a dram after fatiguing duty. \"Clearing hawse,\" is\r\nuntwisting or disentangling two cables that come through different\r\nholes, and make a foul hawse.\r\n\r\nHAWSE-BAGS. Canvas bags filled with oakum, used in heavy seas to stop\r\nthe hawse-holes and prevent the water coming in.\r\n\r\nHAWSE-BLOCKS.

The timbers which compose the bow of a vessel, and their\r\nsides look fore and aft; it is a name given to the foremost timbers of a\r\nship, whose lower ends rest upon the knuckle-timbers. They are generally\r\nparallel to the stem, having their upper ends sometimes terminated by\r\nthe lower part of the beak-head and otherwise by the top of the bow.\r\nAlso, timbers through which the hawse-holes are cut.\r\n\r\nHAWSE-PIPE. A cast-iron pipe in the hawse-holes to prevent the cable\r\nfrom cutting the wood.\r\n\r\nHAWSE-PLUGS.

A large rope or cablet, which holds the middle degree between\r\nthe cable and tow-line, being a size smaller than the former, and as\r\nmuch larger than the latter; curiously, it is not hawser but cable laid.\r\n\r\nHAWSER-LAID ROPE. Is rope made in the usual way, being three or four\r\nstrands of yarns laid up right-handed, or with the sun; it is used for\r\nsmall running rigging, as well as for standing rigging, shrouds, &c.; in\r\nthe latter case it is generally tarred to keep out rain. It is supposed\r\nthat this style of rope is stronger in proportion to the number of yarns\r\nthan cable or water-laid rope, which is more tightly twisted, each\r\nstrand being a small rope. This latter is more impervious to water, and\r\ntherefore good for cables, hawsers, &c.; it is laid left-handed, or\r\nagainst the sun.\r\n\r\nHAWSE-TIMBERS. The upright timbers in the bow, bolted on each side of\r\nthe stem, in which the hawse-holes are cut.\r\n\r\nHAWSE-WOOD. A general name for the hawse-timbers.\r\n\r\nHAY.

Also, in a more\r\nenlarged sense, the whole fore-part of a ship, including the bows on\r\neach side; the head therefore opens the column of water through which\r\nthe ship passes when advancing; hence we say, _head-way_, _head-sails_,\r\n_head-sea_, &c. It is evident that the fore-part of a ship is called its\r\nhead, from its analogy to that of a fish, or any animal while swimming.\r\nAlso, in a confined sense, to that part on each side of the stem outside\r\nthe bows proper which is appropriated to the use of the sailors for\r\nwringing swabs, or any wet jobs, for no wet is permitted in-board after\r\nthe decks are dried. Also, hydrographically, the upper part of a gulf,\r\nbay, or creek.--_By the head_, the state of a ship which, by her lading,\r\ndraws more water forward than aft.

A name given to the waves when they oppose a ship's course, as\r\nthe ship must rise over, or cut through each. Their effect depends upon\r\ntheir height, form, and speed; sometimes they are steep, quick, and\r\nirregular, so that a ship is caught by a second before she has recovered\r\nfrom the first; these render her wet and uneasy.\r\n\r\nHEAD-SHEETS. Specially jibs and staysail sheets, before the fore-mast.\r\n\r\nHEAD-STICK. A short round stick with a hole at each end, through which\r\nthe head-rope of some triangular sails is thrust, before it is sewed on.\r\nIts use is to prevent the head of the sail from twisting.\r\n\r\nHEAD TO WIND. The situation of a ship or boat when her head is pointed\r\ndirectly to windward. The term is particularly applied in the act of\r\ntacking, or while lying at anchor.\r\n\r\nHEAD-WAY.

The undulation of the waves after a gale; long hollow-jawed\r\nsea; ground-swell.\r\n\r\nHOLLOW SHOT. Introduced principally for naval use before the horizontal\r\nfiring of shells from guns became general. Their weight was about\r\ntwo-thirds that of the solid shot; thus they required less charge of\r\npowder and weight of gun than the latter, whilst their smashing effect\r\nand first ranges were supposed to be greater. It is clear, however, that\r\nif filled with powder, their destructive effect must be immensely\r\nincreased.\r\n\r\nHOLLOW SQUARE. The square generally used by British infantry; a\r\nformation to resist cavalry. Each side is composed of four ranks of men,\r\nthe two foremost kneeling with bayonets forming a fence breast high; the\r\ninclosed central space affords shelter to officers, colours, &c.

On the boatswain giving one a cut with his cat, the\r\nboy struck the one before him, and each one did the same, beginning\r\ngently, but, becoming irritated, they at last laid on in earnest. Also,\r\na nautical punishment for quarrelsome fighters was, that two offenders,\r\nsimilarly fastened, thrashed each other until one gave in.

The apparent or visible circle which bounds our vision at sea;\r\nit is that line which is described by the sky and water appearing to\r\nmeet. This is designated as the _sensible_ horizon; the _rational_, or\r\n_true_ one, being a great circle of the heavens, parallel to the\r\nsensible horizon, but passing through the centre of the earth.\r\n\r\nHORIZON-GLASSES. Two small speculums on one of the radii of a quadrant\r\nor sextant; the one half of the fore horizon-glass is silvered, while\r\nthe other half is transparent, in order that an object may be seen\r\ndirectly through it: the back horizon-glass is silvered above and below,\r\nbut in the middle there is a transparent stripe through which the\r\nhorizon can be seen.\r\n\r\nHORIZONTAL. A direction parallel to the horizon, or what is commonly\r\ntermed lying flat. One of the greatest inconveniences navigators have to\r\nstruggle with is the frequent want of a distinct sight of the horizon.\r\nTo obviate this a _horizontal spinning speculum_ was adopted by Mr.\r\nLerson, who was lost in the _Victory_ man-of-war, in which ship he was\r\nsent out to make trial of his instrument. This was afterwards improved\r\nby Smeaton, and consists of a well-polished metal speculum about 3-1/2\r\ninches in diameter, inclosed within a circular rim of brass, so fitted\r\nthat the centre of gravity of the whole shall fall near the point on\r\nwhich it spins. This is the end of a steel axis running through the\r\ncentre of the speculum, above which it finishes in a square for the\r\nconvenience of fitting a roller on it, bearing a piece of tape wound\r\nround it. The cup in which it spins is made of agate flint, or other\r\nhard substance. Sextants, with spirit-levels attached, have latterly\r\nbeen used, as well as Becher's horizon; but great dexterity is demanded\r\nfor anything like an approximation to the truth; wherefore this\r\ncontinues to be a great desideratum in navigation.\r\n\r\nHORIZONTAL FIRE. From artillery, is that in which the piece is laid\r\neither direct on the object, or with but small elevation above it, the\r\nlimit on land being 10 deg., and afloat still less. It is the most telling\r\nunder ordinary circumstances, and includes all other varieties, with the\r\nexception of vertical fire, which has elevations of from 30 deg. and\r\nupwards; and, according to some few, curved fire, an intermediate kind,\r\nof limited application.\r\n\r\nHORIZONTAL PARALLAX. _See_ PARALLAX.\r\n\r\nHORIZONTAL PLAN.

In order to keep\r\nthe horse more parallel to the yard, it is usually attached thereto at\r\nproper distances, by certain ropes called stirrups, which have an eye\r\nspliced into their lower ends, through which the horse passes. (_See_\r\nSTIRRUPS and FOOT-ROPES.) Also, a rope formerly fast to the fore-mast\r\nfore-shrouds, with a dead-eye to receive the spritsail-sheet-pendant,\r\nand keep the spritsail-sheets clear of the flukes of the anchor. Also,\r\nthe breast-rope which is made fast to the shrouds to protect the\r\nleadsman. Also, applied to any pendant and thimble through which\r\nrunning-rigging was led, now commonly called a lizard. Also, a thick\r\nrope, extending in a perpendicular direction near the fore or after side\r\nof a mast, for the purpose of hoisting some yard, or extending a sail\r\nthereon; when before the mast, it is used for the square-sail, whose\r\nyard is attached to the horse by means of a traveller or bull's-eye,\r\nwhich slides up and down. When it is abaft the mast, it is intended for\r\nthe trysail of a snow; but is seldom used in this position, except in\r\nthose sloops of war which occasionally assume the appearance of snows to\r\ndeceive the enemy. Also, the name of the sawyer's frame or trestle.\r\nAlso, the round iron bar formerly fixed to the main-rail at the head\r\nwith stanchions; a fir rail is now used, and the head berthed up. Also,\r\nin cutters or schooners, one horse is a stout iron bar, with a large\r\nthimble, which spans the vessel from side to side close to the deck\r\nbefore the fore-mast. To this the forestaysail-sheet is hauled, and\r\ntraverses. The other horse is a similar bar abaft, on which the\r\nmain-boom sheet traverses. Also, cross-pieces on the tops of standards,\r\non which the booms or spare-spars or boats are lashed between the fore\r\nand main masts. Horses are also termed jack-stays, on which sails are\r\nhauled out, as gaff-sails. Horse is a term of derision where an officer\r\nassumes the grandioso, demanding honour where honour is not his due.\r\nAlso, a strict disciplinarian, in nautical parlance. Also, tough salt\r\nbeef--_salt horse_.--_Flemish horse_ is the horse which has an iron\r\nthimble in one end, which goes over the iron point of the yard-arm\r\nbefore the studding-sail boom-iron is put on; in the other, a lashing\r\neye, which is secured near the head earing of the top-sail. It is\r\nintended for the men at the earing in reefing, or when setting the\r\ntop-gallant-studding-sails.\r\n\r\nHORSE-ARTILLERY. A branch of field artillery specially equipped to\r\nman[oe]uvre with cavalry, having lighter guns, and all its gunners\r\nmounted on horseback.

A comparative estimate of the capacity of steam-engines, by\r\nassuming a certain average effective pressure of steam, and a certain\r\naverage linear velocity of the piston. The pressure multiplied by the\r\nvelocity gives the effective force of the engine exerted through a given\r\nnumber of feet per minute; and since the force called a horse-power\r\nmeans 33,000 lbs. acting thus one foot per minute, it follows that the\r\nnominal power of the engine will be found by dividing the effective\r\nforce exerted by the piston, multiplied by the number of feet per minute\r\nthrough which it acts by 33,000.\r\n\r\nHORSES. Blocks in whalers for cutting blubber on. (_See_ WHITE-HORSE.)\r\n\r\nHORSE-SHOE. In old fortification, a low work of this plan sometimes\r\nthrown up in ditches.\r\n\r\nHORSE-SHOE CLAMP.

Over the\r\nmuzzle of every gun are two strong eye-bolts for the muzzle-lashings,\r\nwhich are 3-1/2-inch rope. When this operation is well performed, no\r\naccident is feared, as every act is one of mechanical skill. A gun is\r\nsometimes housed fore and aft to make room, as in the cabin, &c.

The term was introduced to us by the buccaneers as small insular\r\nspots with a scant vegetation; without the latter they are merely termed\r\nsand-banks. Key is especially used in the West Indies, and often applied\r\nto the smaller coral shoals produced by zoophytes.\r\n\r\nKEY, OR QUAY.

It also affords security to the bowsprit by increasing the angle\r\nof the bobstay, so as to make it act more perpendicularly on the\r\nbowsprit.

The term is synonymous with _bollard timbers_.--_Knight-heads_\r\nalso formerly denoted in many merchant ships, two strong frames of\r\ntimber fixed on the main-deck, a little behind the fore-mast, which\r\nsupported the ends of the windlass. They were frequently called the\r\n_bitts_, and then their upper parts only were denominated the\r\nknight-heads, from having been embellished with a carved head. (_See_\r\nWINDLASS.) Also, a name formerly given to the lower jear-blocks, which\r\nwere then no other than bitts, containing several sheaves, and nearly\r\nresembling our present topsail-sheet bitts.\r\n\r\nKNIGHTHOOD.

A term used to deride the idea of any\r\nwork, however light, being relaxation; just as giving up taking in heavy\r\nbeams of timber and being set to carry deals, is not really knocking off\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nKNOLL. The top of a rounded hill; the head of a bank, or the most\r\nelevated part of a submarine shoal. [Perhaps derived from _nowl_, a\r\nprovincialism for head.]\r\n\r\nKNOPP. _See_ KNAP.\r\n\r\nKNOT. A large knob formed on the extremity of a rope, generally by\r\nuntwisting its ends, and interweaving them regularly among each other;\r\nof these there are several sorts, differing in form, size, and name, as\r\ndiamond knot, kop knot, overhand knot, reef knot, shroud knot, stopper\r\nknot, single wall knot, double wall knot. The bowline knot is so firmly\r\nmade, and fastened to the cringles of the sails, that they must break,\r\nor the sails split, before it will slip. (_See_ RUNNING BOWLINE.) The\r\nsheepshank knot serves to shorten a rope without cutting it, and may be\r\npresently loosened. The wall-knot is so made with the lays of a rope\r\nthat it cannot slip, and serves for sheets, tacks, and stoppers. Knots\r\nare generally used to act as a button, in preventing the end of a rope\r\nfrom slipping through the hole of a dead-eye, or through the turns of a\r\nlaniard, by which they are sometimes made fast to other ropes.--_Knot_\r\nalso implies a division on the log line, bearing a similar proportion to\r\na mile, which half a minute does to an hour; that is, it is 1/120 of a\r\nmile; hence we say, the ship was going 8 knots, signifying 8 miles per\r\nhour. Indeed, in nautical parlance, the words knot and mile are\r\nsynonyms, alluding to the geographical mile of 60' to a degree of\r\nlatitude.\r\n\r\nKNOWL. A term commonly given to the summits of elevated lands in the\r\nwest of England, therefore probably the same as _knoll_.\r\n\r\nKNOWLEDGE.

Vessels carry heavy\r\ngoods by the ton of 20 cwt., but lighter goods by a ton of cubic feet,\r\nwhich varies according to the custom of the port; in London it is 40, in\r\nIndia from 50 to 52, depending on the goods.

A launch being proportionably longer, lower, and more\r\nflat-bottomed than the merchantman's long-boat, is in consequence less\r\nfit for sailing, but better calculated for rowing and approaching a flat\r\nshore. Its principal superiority consists in being much fitter to\r\nunder-run the cable, lay out anchors, &c., which is a very necessary\r\nemployment in the harbours of the Levant, where the cables of different\r\nships are fastened across each other, and frequently render such\r\noperations necessary.\r\n\r\nLAUNCH, TO.

By various conventional compacts, the Law of Nations\r\nbecame positive; thus flags of truce are respected, and prisoners are\r\nnot put to death. One independent state is declared incompetent to\r\nprescribe to another, so long as that state is innoxious to its\r\nneighbours.

It gave way to the less dangerous match-tub, and since\r\nthat to gun-locks, friction-tubes, &c. Shakspeare in _Henry V._ says:\r\n\r\n            \"And the nimble gunner\r\n    With _linstock_ now the devilish cannon touches,\r\n    And down goes all before them.\"\r\n\r\nLINTRES.

A piece of rope, sometimes with two legs, and one or more iron\r\nthimbles spliced into it. It is used for various purposes; one is often\r\nmade fast to the topsail-tye, for the buntlines to reeve through, to\r\nconfine them to the centre of the yard. A lizard with a tail and thimble\r\nis used as a fair lead, to lead out where the lift runs in a line with\r\nthe object. The lower boom topping-lift is thus helped by carrying the\r\nlizard out to the fore-brace block. In yards sent aloft ready for\r\ncrossing, the lizard confines the yard rope until the order is given,\r\n\"Sway across,\" when, letting the lizard run, all cross simultaneously.\r\n\r\nLIZIERE.

Its detection and remedies are amongst the most important studies\r\nof navigators of iron ships and steamers.\r\n\r\nLOCAL MARINE-BOARD. _See_ MARINE BOARDS.\r\n\r\nLOCH. Gaelic for lake, in Scotland and Ireland. In Scotland also an arm\r\nof the sea, where the tides ebb and flow; on the east coast called a\r\n_firth_, though on the west mostly termed a _loch_.\r\n\r\nLOCHABER AXE. A formidable weapon once used by the Highlanders.\r\n\r\nLOCK. The striking instrument by which fire is produced for the\r\ndischarge of a gun, containing the cock, the hammer, the pan, &c.

Two boards shutting together like a book, and divided into\r\nseveral columns, in which to record, through the hours of the day and\r\nnight, the direction of the wind and the course of the ship, with all\r\nthe material occurrences, together with the latitude by observation.\r\nFrom this table the officers work the ship's way, and compile their\r\njournals. The whole being written by the mate of the watch with chalk,\r\nis rubbed out every day at noon. Now a slate is more generally used.\r\n\r\nLOG-BOOK. Mostly called the log, is a journal into which the log-board\r\nis daily transcribed, together with any other circumstance deserving\r\nnotice. The intermediate divisions or watches are usually signed by the\r\ncommanding officer. It is also divided into _harbour-log_ and _sea-log_.\r\n\r\nLOG-CANOE. One hollowed out of a single log. (_See_ CANOE.)\r\n\r\nLOGGED. Entered in the log. A very serious punishment, not long disused,\r\nas a mark of disgrace, by recording the omissions of an officer.

(_See_ WATER-LOGGED.)\r\n\r\nLOGGERHEAD, OR LOGGER-HEAT. A round ball of iron attached to a long\r\nhandle with a hook at the end of it. It heats tar by being made hot in\r\nthe fire, and then plunged into the tar-bucket. It was also used to\r\npound cocoa before chocolate was supplied. Also, an upright rounded\r\npiece of wood, near the stern of a whale-boat, for catching a turn of\r\nthe line to. Also, a name given to a well-known turtle, _Chelonia\r\ncaouana_, from its having a great head; it is sometimes called the\r\n_whooper_ or _whapper_. (_See_ TURTLE.)\r\n\r\nLOG-GLASS. The sand-glass used at heaving the log to obtain the rate of\r\nsailing. It is a 28 seconds glass for slow sailing, and 14 seconds for\r\nfast sailing.\r\n\r\nLOG-LINE AND LOG-SHIP. A small line about 100 fathoms long, fastened to\r\nthe log-ship by means of two legs, one of which passes through a hole at\r\nthe corner, and is knotted on the opposite side, while the other leg is\r\nattached by a pin fixed into another hole so as to draw out when _stop_\r\nis called, _i.e._ when the glass has run out. This line, from the\r\ndistance of 10, 12, or 15 fathoms of the log-ship, has certain knots or\r\ndivisions, which ought to be 47 feet 4 inches from each other, though it\r\nwas the common practice at sea not to have them above 42 feet. The\r\nestimate of the ship's way or distance run is done by observing the\r\nlength of the line unwound whilst the glass is running; for so many\r\nknots as run out in that time, so many miles the ship sails in an\r\nhour.--_To heave the log_ is to throw it into the water on the lee-side,\r\nwell out of the wake, letting it run until it gets beyond the eddies,\r\nthen a person holding the glass turns it up just as the first mark, or\r\nstray-line, goes out, from which the knots begin to be reckoned. The log\r\nis, however, at best, a precarious way of computing, and must be\r\ncorrected by experience. The inventor of it is not known, and no mention\r\nis made of it till the year 1607, in an East India voyage, published by\r\nPurchas. The mode before, and even now in some colliers, and in native\r\ncraft in the East Indies, is to throw a _log_ or chip overboard at the\r\nforemost channel-plate, and to walk aft, keeping up with it until it\r\npasses the stern, thus estimating (and closely too by practice) the rate\r\nof motion. Other methods have been invented by various people, but\r\n_Massey's Patent Log_ gives the most accurate measurement. The same\r\nprinciple is also applied to the deep-sea sounding-lead.\r\n\r\nLOGWOOD. Dyewood, _Haematoxylon campechianum_. It occurs on both sides of\r\nthe American coasts near the Isthmus of Darien, and is a great article\r\nof trade, varying from L5 to L10 per ton.

The epithet for the captain or commander of a merchant vessel.\r\nWhen England first became a maritime power, ships with sailors, and a\r\nmaster to navigate, were furnished by the Cinque Ports, &c., and the\r\nfighting part of the men was composed of soldiers sent on board,\r\ncommanded by generals, &c. Among the early voyagers there was a\r\ndistinction between _master_ and _maister_, the latter being the office;\r\nas, \"we spoke the _Dragon_, whereof Master Ivie was maister,\" in Welsh's\r\n_Voyage to Benin_, A.D. 1590. In most applications, _master_ denotes\r\nchief; as master boat-builder, master caulker, master sail-maker, &c.\r\n\r\nMASTER OF A SHIP-OF-WAR. An officer appointed by the commissioners of\r\nthe navy to attend to the navigating a ship under the direction of the\r\ncaptain, the working of a ship into her station in the order of battle,\r\nand in other circumstances of danger, but he reports to the first\r\nlieutenant, who carries out any necessary evolution. It is likewise his\r\nduty, in concert with lieutenants on surveys, to examine and report on\r\nthe provisions. He is moreover charged with their stowage. For the\r\nperformance of these services he is allowed several assistants, who are\r\ntermed second-masters, master's assistants, &c. This officer's station\r\nhas been termed the meridional altitude of the lower order of\r\nmidshipmen, but it is requisite that he be both a good officer and a\r\nseaman. He ranks after lieutenants according to date, but is subordinate\r\nin command to all lieutenants.\r\n\r\nMASTER AND COMMANDER. A title which, in 1814, was simplified to\r\ncommander, the next degree above lieutenant; he ranks with, but after, a\r\nlieutenant-colonel.\r\n\r\nMASTER-AT-ARMS. In former times was an officer appointed to command the\r\npolice-duty of a ship, to teach the crew the exercise of small arms, to\r\nconfine by order of superiors any prisoners, and to superintend their\r\nconfinement. Also, to take care that fires and lights were put out at\r\nthe proper hour, and no spirituous liquors brought on board. He was\r\nassisted by _ship's corporals_, who also attended the gangway with the\r\nsentinels. Until 1816, the junior lieutenant was nominally\r\nlieutenant-at-arms, and drilled the seamen, assisted by the serjeant of\r\nmarines.\r\n\r\nMASTER-ATTENDANT. An officer in the royal dockyards appointed to assist\r\nin the fitting or dismantling, removing or securing vessels of war, &c.,\r\nat the port where he resides; to inspect the moorings in the harbour, to\r\nvisit all the ships in ordinary, and to attend at the general musters in\r\nthe dockyard, taking care that all the individuals registered in the\r\nnavy-book are present at their duty.\r\n\r\nMASTER MARINER.

That which is used for sending masts\r\nup or down.\r\n\r\nMASULAH OR MASSOOLAH BOATS. Madras boats, of which the planks are sewed\r\ntogether with coir yarn, crossing the stitches over a wadding of coir or\r\nstraw, which presses on the joints, and prevents much leakage. The\r\nvessel is thus rendered pliable, and yields to the shock on taking the\r\nground in the surf, which at times runs from 10 to 16 feet high. They\r\nare rowed by twelve men, in double banks, with oars formed by an oval\r\npiece of board lashed to the end of a rough piece of wood. They are\r\nguided by one man with a long steer-oar, who stamps and yells with\r\nexcitement as he urges the men to pull when a rolling surf is coming up\r\nastern. These boats are from 30 to 35 feet in length, 10 to 11 feet in\r\nbreadth, and 7 to 8 feet in depth.\r\n\r\nMAT. To prevent chafing, a thick mat is woven from strands of old rope,\r\nspun yarn, or foxes, containing each a greater or lesser number of\r\nrope-yarns, in proportion to the intended mat to be made. The largest\r\nand strongest kinds are called _paunch-mats_. The _thrum-mat_ is\r\nprecisely similar to the present cocoa-nut fibre door-mats. Where it is\r\npossible, rounding is now used instead of mats, it being neater and\r\nholding less water.\r\n\r\nMATCH. A wager of emulation by rowing, sailing, man[oe]uvring, &c.\r\n(_See_ QUICK MATCH.)--_Slow match_, used by artillerymen, is a very\r\nloose rope steeped in a solution of nitre, and burns at the rate of\r\nabout one inch an hour, and is either used alone, or for lighting the\r\nport-fires, by which guns are yet fired for salutes on shore.\r\n\r\nMATCHLOCK. A musket fired with a match fixed on the cock opening the\r\npan; long out of use, except in China and some parts of India.\r\n\r\nMATCH-TUBS.

Formerly an assistant gunner in the artillery.\r\n\r\nMATTHEW WALKER. A knot, so termed from the originator. It is formed by a\r\nhalf hitch on each strand in the direction of the lay, so that the rope\r\ncan be continued after the knot is formed, which shows as a transverse\r\ncollar of three strands. It is the knot used on the end of the laniards\r\nof rigging, where dead-eyes are employed.\r\n\r\nMAUD. A salmon-net fixed in a square form by four stakes.\r\n\r\nMAUL. A heavy iron hammer, used for driving tree-nails or bolts; it has\r\none end faced, and the opposite pointed, whence it is often called a\r\npin-maul.--_Top-maul_ is distinguished by having an iron handle, with an\r\neye at the end, by which it is tied fast to the mast-head. It is kept\r\naloft for driving the iron fid in or out of the top-mast.\r\n\r\nMAUND. An Indian weight, which varies in amount depending on the part of\r\nthe country.

A public fund accumulated by fees payable to the\r\nBoard of Trade on account of the merchant shipping.\r\n\r\nMERCATOR'S CHART OR PROJECTION. Introduced by Gerard Mercator, _circa_\r\n1556: it is a projection of the surface of the earth in the plane, with\r\nall the meridians made parallel with each other, consequently the\r\ndegrees of longitude all equal, the degrees of latitude increasing in a\r\ncorresponding ratio towards the poles. This is the chart most commonly\r\nused in navigation; and its use appears to have obtained quickly, for in\r\n1576, among the items of Martin Frobisher's outfit, we find, \"For a\r\ngreate Mappe Universall of Mercator, in prente, L1, 6_s._ 8_d._\"\r\n\r\nMERCATOR'S SAILING. Performed loxodromically, by means of Mercator's\r\ncharts.\r\n\r\nMERCHANTMAN.

A company of merchants who traded with Russia,\r\nTurkey, and other distant parts. In the _Affectionate Shepheard_, 1594,\r\nwe find--\r\n\r\n    \"Well is he tearm'd a merchant venturer,\r\n      Since he doth venter lands, and goods, and all;\r\n    When he doth travell for his traffique far,\r\n      Little he knowes what fortune may befall.\"\r\n\r\nMERCURIAL GAUGE. A curved tube partly filled with mercury, to show the\r\npressure of steam in an engine.\r\n\r\nMERCURY. One of the ancient inferior planets, and the nearest to the\r\nsun, as far as we yet know.

An Anglo-Saxon word still in use, sometimes meaning a lake, and\r\ngenerally the sea itself.\r\n\r\nMERIDIAN, OF THE EARTH. Is an imaginary great circle passing through the\r\nzenith and the poles, and cutting the equator at right angles. When the\r\nsun is on the meridian of any place, it is mid-day there, and at all\r\nplaces situated under the same meridian.--_First meridian_ is that from\r\nwhich the longitude is reckoned. Magnetic meridian is not a great circle\r\nbut a wavy line uniting those poles. In common acceptation, a meridian\r\nis any line supposed to be drawn from the north to the south pole;\r\ntherefore a place being under the same meridian as another place, is\r\neither due north or south of it.--_Plane of the meridian_ is the plane\r\nof this great circle, and its intersection with the sensible horizon is\r\ncalled the _meridian line_.--The _meridian transit_ of a heavenly body\r\nis the act of passing over the said plane, when it is either due north\r\nor south of the spectator.--_Ante meridiem_, or A.M., before\r\nnoon.--_Post meridiem_, or P.M., after noon.\r\n\r\nMERIDIAN ERROR. The deviation of a transit-instrument from the plane of\r\nthe meridian at the horizon; it is also termed the _azimuthal error_.\r\n\r\nMERLON.

The name of a peculiar sponge, _Spongia palmata_,\r\nabundant at Bermuda.\r\n\r\nMERMAID'S PURSE. The oblong horny cases with long filiform appendages\r\ndeveloped from each of the four corners, found on the sea-shore, being\r\nthe outer covering of the eggs of several species of rays and sharks.\r\nAlso, the hollow root of the sea-weed _Fucus polyschides_.\r\n\r\nMERRY DANCERS.

A large cable-laid rope, used to unmoor or heave up the\r\nanchor of a ship, by the aid of the capstan. This is done by binding a\r\npart of the messenger to the cable by which the ship rides, in several\r\nplaces, with pliant nippers, and by winding another part of it about\r\nthe capstan. The messenger has an eye-splice at each end, through which\r\nseveral turns of a strong lashing are passed, forming an endless rope.\r\nSo that by putting on fresh nippers forward, and taking them off as they\r\nare hove aft, the capstan may be kept constantly going, and the cable is\r\nwalked in without stopping. (_See_ VIOL.) A superior plan is now\r\nadopted, in which the messenger, consisting of a pitch chain which has a\r\ndouble and single link alternately, works in iron spurs fastened above\r\nthe lower rim of the capstan. This avoids the trouble of shifting or\r\nfleeting the messenger while heaving in. Again, the cable itself is\r\ncommonly brought to the capstan.--_Light forward the messenger!_ is the\r\norder to pull the slack of it towards the hawse holes, on the slack or\r\nopposite side, so as to be ready to fasten upon the cable which is being\r\nhove in, as it comes off the manger-roller at the bows.\r\n\r\nMESSENGERS. Boys appointed to carry orders from the quarter-deck. In\r\nsome ships they wore winged caps of the Mercury type.\r\n\r\nMESS-KID. A wooden tub for holding cooked victuals or cocoa.\r\n\r\nMESSMATE.

The kids, crockery, bowls, spoons, and other articles of\r\nmess service.\r\n\r\nMETA-CENTRE. That point in a ship where a vertical line drawn from the\r\ncentre of cavity cuts a line perpendicular to the keel, passing through\r\nthe centre of gravity. As this depends upon the situation of the centre\r\nof cavity, the meta-centre is often called the _shifting-centre_. Safety\r\nrequires this point to be above the centre of gravity.\r\n\r\nMETAL. A word comprehending the great guns, or ordnance generally, of a\r\nship or battery.\r\n\r\nMETEINGS. The measurement and estimate of timber.\r\n\r\nMETEOR. _See_ COMPASANT, WATER-SPOUT, &c.\r\n\r\nMETEORITES.

A cycle of 19 years, which contains 235 lunations, and\r\nresults in a correspondence of the solar and lunar years. The discovery\r\nof this astronomical period may be safely assigned to Meton in 432 B.C.\r\n\r\nMEW [Anglo-Saxon _maew_]. A name for the sea-gull.\r\n\r\nMIASMA.

That timber in the stern which is placed amidships.\r\n\r\nMIDDLE-TOPSAIL. A deep-roached sail, set in some schooners and sloops on\r\nthe heel of their top-masts between the top and the cap. A modification\r\nof this, under the name of a lower top-sail, is now very common in\r\ndouble-topsail-yarded ships. (Cunningham's top-sails.)\r\n\r\nMIDDLE-WALES. The three or four thick strakes worked along each side\r\nbetween the lower and middle-deck-ports in three-deckers.\r\n\r\nMIDDLE-WATCH.

A naval cadet appointed by the admiralty, with the exception\r\nof one in each ship appointed by the captain. No person can be appointed\r\nmidshipman until he has served one year, and passed his examinations;\r\nnor a lieutenant without having previously served six years in the royal\r\nnavy as midshipman, and having further passed two severe\r\nexaminations--one in seamanship and one in gunnery. A midshipman is then\r\nthe station in which a young volunteer is trained in the several\r\nexercises necessary to attain a knowledge of steam, machinery,\r\ndiscipline, the general movements and operations of a ship, and qualify\r\nhim to command.\r\n\r\nMIDSHIPMAN'S NUTS.

Often a very dull\r\nmiscellany, though kept by intelligent masters.\r\n\r\nREMBERGE. A long narrow rowing vessel of war, formerly used by the\r\nEnglish. Its name is derived from _remo_ and _barca_, and it seems to\r\nhave been the precursor of the Deal luggers.\r\n\r\nREMBLAI. The mass of earth requisite for the construction of the\r\nrampart. An embankment.\r\n\r\nREMORA. The _sucker-fish_.

Is the retaking a vessel from the enemy before she\r\nhas arrived in any neutral or hostile port. If a vessel thus retaken has\r\nbeen 24 hours in the possession of an enemy, she is deemed a lawful\r\nrecapture; but if within that time, she is merely _detenu_, and must be\r\nwholly restored to the owner. An amount of salvage is sometimes awarded\r\nto the re-captors.

An official demand for stores, &c.\r\n\r\nRESCUE. Any vessel recovered by the insurrection of prisoners on board\r\nof her, or by her being forced by stress of weather into our ports, she\r\nis restored on _salvage_. There is no rule prescribed by the law of\r\nEngland in the case of foreign property rescued; with British subjects\r\nthe court usually adopts the proportion of recapture. In respect to\r\nforeigners the only guide is that of \"quantum meruit.\"\r\n\r\nRESERVE. A portion drawn out from the main body, and stationed in the\r\nrear for a special object.\r\n\r\nRE-SHIP.

A vertical circle of any given place, or the\r\nintersection of a part of such a circle with the horizon. Rhumbs,\r\ntherefore, coincide with points of the world, or of the horizon; and\r\nhence seamen distinguish the rhumbs by the same names as the points and\r\nwinds, as marked on the fly or card of the compass. The _rhumb-line_,\r\ntherefore, is a line prolonged from any point of the compass in a\r\nnautical chart, except the four cardinal points; or it is a line which a\r\nship, keeping in the same collateral point or rhumb, describes\r\nthroughout its whole course.\r\n\r\nRHYDAL [from the Celtic _rhydle_].

Timbers laid as required, reaching from the keelson to the\r\norlop-beams, to bind a ship and give additional strength. They are\r\nvariously termed, as _lower futtock-riders_ and _middle futtock-riders_.\r\nWhen a vessel is weak, or has broken her floors or timbers, riders are\r\nintroduced to secure the ship, and enable her to reach a port where she\r\ncan be properly repaired.

By sailors the word is also\r\nvariously applied. Thus they say--\"We shipped a heavy sea.\" \"There is a\r\ngreat sea on in the offing.\" \"The sea sets to the southward,\" &c. Hence\r\na ship is said to head the sea when her course is opposed to the\r\ndirection of the waves.--_A long sea_ implies a uniform motion of long\r\nwaves, the result of a steady continuance of the wind from nearly the\r\nsame quarter.--_A short sea_ is a confused motion of the waves when they\r\nrun irregularly so as frequently to break over a vessel, caused by\r\nsudden changes of wind. The law claims for the crown wherever the sea\r\nflows to, and there the admiralty has jurisdiction; accordingly, no act\r\ncan be done, no bridge can span a river so circumstanced without the\r\nsanction of the admiralty. It claims the fore-shore unless specially\r\ngranted by charter otherwise, and the court of vice-admiralty has\r\njurisdiction as to flotsam and jetsam on the fore-shore. But all crimes\r\nare subject to the laws, and are tried by the ordinary courts as within\r\nthe body of a county, comprehended by the chord between two headlands\r\nwhere the distance does not exceed three miles from the shore. Beyond\r\nthat limit is \"the sea, where high court of admiralty has jurisdiction,\r\nbut where civil process cannot follow.\"\r\n\r\nSEA-ADDER. The west-country term for the pipe-fish _Syngnathus_.

The pod or vesicle of some species of _sea-wrack_ or _Fucus\r\ngigantea_ of Cape Horn and the Straits of Magellan.\r\n\r\nSEA-BREEZE. A wind from the sea towards the land. In tropical climates\r\n(and sometimes during summer in the temperate zone) as the day advances\r\nthe land becomes extremely heated by the sun, which causes an ascending\r\ncurrent of air, and a wind from the sea rushes in to restore\r\nequilibrium. Above the sea-breeze is a counter current, which was\r\nclearly shown in Madras, where an aeronaut waited until the sea-breeze\r\nhad set in to make his ascent, expecting to be blown inland, but after\r\nrising to a certain height found himself going out to sea, and in his\r\nhaste to descend he disordered the machinery, and could not close the\r\nvalve which allowed the gas to escape, so fell into the sea about three\r\nmiles from the land, but clung to his balloon and was saved. Also, a\r\ncool sea drink.\r\n\r\nSEA-BRIEF. A specification of the nature and quantity of the cargo of a\r\nship, the place whence it comes, and its destination. (_See_ PASSPORT.)\r\n\r\nSEA-CALF.

Hale and Desaguliers to\r\ninvestigate the depth of the sea, by the pressure of air into a tube\r\nprepared for the purpose, showing by a mark left by a thin surface of\r\ntreacle carried on mercury forced up it during the descent into what\r\nspace the whole air is compressed, and, consequently, the depth of water\r\nby which its weight produced that compression. It is, however, an\r\nuncertain and difficult instrument, and superseded by Ericson's patent,\r\nworking on the same principle, but passing over into another tube the\r\nvolume of water thus forced in.

In 1613 a junk of 800 or 1000 tons\r\nwas seen in Japan all sheeted with iron; and yet it was not attempted in\r\nEurope till more than a hundred years afterwards. But by 1783 ships of\r\nevery class were coppered.\r\n\r\nSHEATHING-NAILS. These are used to fasten wood-sheathing, and prevent\r\nthe filling-nails from tearing it too much.

To deviate from that position, and thereby risk fouling\r\nthe anchor. Thus a vessel riding with short scope of cable breaks her\r\nsheer, and bringing the force of the whole length of the ship at right\r\nangles, tears the anchor out of the ground, and drifts into deep water.\r\n\r\nSHEER-BATTEN. A batten stretched horizontally along the shrouds, and\r\nseized firmly above each of their dead-eyes, serving to prevent the\r\ndead-eyes from turning at that part. This is also termed a _stretcher_.\r\n\r\nSHEER-DRAUGHT.

When a ship sails\r\nwith a side wind, the lower corners of the main and fore sails are\r\nfastened by a tack and a sheet, the former being to windward, and the\r\nlatter to leeward; the tack is, however, only disused with a stern wind,\r\nwhereas the sail is never spread without the assistance of one or both\r\nof the sheets; the staysails and studding-sails have only one tack and\r\none sheet each; the staysail-tacks are fastened forward, and the sheets\r\ndrawn aft; but the studding-sail tacks draw to the extremity of the\r\nboom, while the sheet is employed to extend the inner corner.\r\n\r\nSHEET-ANCHOR. One of four bower anchors supplied, two at the bows, and\r\none at either chest-tree abaft the fore-rigging; one is termed the\r\nsheet, the other the spare anchor; usually got ready in a gale to let go\r\non the parting of a bower.

The mutilation of this member was\r\nalways a most punishable offence; for which the laws of King Alfred\r\ninflicted a penalty of fifteen shillings, which at that time probably\r\nwas a sum beyond the bowman's means.\r\n\r\nSHOOTING-GLOVES. These were furnished to the navy when cross-bows,\r\nlong-bows, and slur-bows were used.\r\n\r\nSHOOTING OF NETS.

The same as fringing reef.\r\n\r\nSHORT, SHORT STAY, SHORT APEEK. \"Heave short,\" means to heave in the\r\ncable till it is nearly up and down, and would hold the vessel securely\r\nuntil she had set all common sail, and would not drag or upset the\r\nanchor. If, however, the wind be free, and the making sail unimportant,\r\n_short_ would probably be _short apeek_, or up and down, the last move\r\nof weighing awaiting perhaps signal or permission to part.\r\n\r\nSHORT ALLOWANCE. When the provisions will not last the period expected,\r\nthey may be reduced in part, as two-thirds, half-allowance, &c., and\r\nthus _short-allowance money_ becomes due, which is the nominal value of\r\nthe provisions stopped, and paid in compensation.\r\n\r\nSHORT BOARDS.

When used\r\nwithout prefix, the term generally means the solid shot only, as fired\r\nfor a heavy blow, or for penetration. Also, a synonym of _scot_, a\r\nreckoning at an inn, and has immemorially been thus understood.

Also, a foot-soldier who\r\ncarried a fire-lock.--_To be shot of_, signifies to get rid of, turned\r\nout.--_To shot the guns._ In active service the guns were generally\r\nloaded, but not shotted, as, from corrosion, it was found difficult to\r\ndraw the shot; and the working and concussion not unfrequently started\r\nit, and consequently, if the gun was fired before re-driving it \"home,\"\r\nit was in danger of bursting.\r\n\r\nSHOT-LOCKER. A compartment built up in the hold to contain the shot.\r\n\r\nSHOT-NET. A mackerel-net.\r\n\r\nSHOT-PLUGS. Tapered cones to stop any sized shot-hole.\r\n\r\nSHOT-RACKS.

Invented by General Shrapnel to produce, at a long\r\nrange, the effect of common case; whence they have been also called\r\n_spherical case_. They have a thickness of only one-tenth of their\r\ndiameter; so that, on the action of the fuse, they are opened by a very\r\nsmall bursting charge, and allow the bullets with which they are filled\r\nto proceed with much the same direction and velocity that the shell had\r\nat the moment of explosion. They require, however, extremely nice\r\nmanagement.\r\n\r\nSHRIMP. The small crustacean _Crangon vulgaris_, well known as an\r\narticle of food.\r\n\r\nSHROUD-KNOT. _See_ KNOT.\r\n\r\nSHROUD-LAID. The combination in the larger cordage, also known as\r\nhawser-laid.\r\n\r\nSHROUD-ROPE. A finer quality of hawser-laid rope than is commonly used\r\nfor other purposes. It is also termed purchase-rope; but four-stranded\r\nrope is frequently used for standing rigging. All the strands are finer,\r\nof better hemp, and pass the gauge. Thus the patent shroud-laid rope,\r\nmade from clean Petersburgh hemp, was found to break at a strain between\r\n6-3/4 and 7-1/4 cwt. per inch of girth in inches squared. Thus a patent\r\nrope of 5 inches would require 175 cwt. Common rope, 25 threads in each\r\nstrand, broke with 5 cwt. per inch, and fell off at 130 threads to 4\r\ncwt. per inch. Thus,\r\n\r\n                                                      cwt.  qrs.  lbs.\r\n A common 10-inch cable weighed per 100 fathoms,       19     0    21\r\n A superior         \"              \"                   21     0     3\r\n\r\nSHROUDS. The lower and upper standing-rigging. They are always divided\r\ninto pairs or couples; that is to say, one piece of rope is doubled, and\r\nthe parts fastened together at a small distance from the middle, so as\r\nto leave a sort of noose or collar to fix upon the mast-head; the ends\r\nhave each a dead-eye turned in, by which they are set up by laniards to\r\nthe channel. (_See_ CHAINS and DEAD-EYE.)--_Bentinck-shrouds._ Strong\r\nropes fixed on the futtock-staves of the lower rigging, and extending to\r\nthe opposite channels, where they are set-up by means of dead-eyes and\r\nlaniards, or gun-tackle runner purchases, in the same manner as the\r\nother shrouds. Their use is to support the masts when the ship\r\nrolls.--_Bowsprit shrouds_ are now generally made of chain. They support\r\nthe bowsprit in the same way that other shrouds support the\r\nmasts.--_Bumkin or boomkin shrouds._ Strong chains fixed as stays to the\r\nbumkin ends, to support the strain exerted by the fore-tacks upon\r\nthem.--_Futtock or foot-hook shrouds._ Portions of rigging (now\r\nsometimes chain) communicating with the futtock-plates above the top,\r\nand the cat-harpings below, and forming ladders, whereby the sailors\r\nclimb over the top-brim. _Top-gallant shrouds_ extend to the\r\ncross-trees, where, passing through holes in the ends, they continue\r\nover the futtock-staves of the top-mast rigging, and descending almost\r\nto the top, are set up by laniards passing through thimbles instead of\r\ndead-eyes.--_Topmast-shrouds_ extend from the top-mast head to the edges\r\nof the tops, and are set up to the futtock dead-eyes.\r\n\r\nSHROUD-STOPPER. A stout rope-stopper made fast above and below a part of\r\nthe shroud which has been damaged by an enemy's shot, or otherwise.\r\n\r\nSHROUD-TRUCKS.

To be in soundings implies being so near the land that a\r\ndeep-sea lead will reach the bottom, which is seldom practicable in the\r\nocean. As soundings may, however, be obtained at enormous depths, and at\r\ngreat distances from the land, the term is limited in common parlance to\r\nparts not far from the shore, and where the depth is about 80 or 100\r\nfathoms.

When a vessel has sufficient motion in the water to admit\r\nof the helm being effective.\r\n\r\nSTEER HER COURSE, TO. Going with the wind fair enough to lay her course.\r\n\r\nSTEERING [Anglo-Saxon _steoran_]. The perfection of steering consists in\r\na vigilant attention to the motion of the ship's head, so as to check\r\nevery deviation from the line of her course in the first instant of its\r\ncommencement, and in applying as little of the power of the helm as\r\npossible, for the action of the rudder checks a ship's speed.\r\n\r\nSTEERING-SAIL. An incorrect name for a studding-sail.\r\n\r\nSTEER LARGE, TO. To go free, off the wind. Also, to steer loosely.\r\n\r\nSTEER SMALL, TO.

The\r\noutside of the stem is usually marked with a scale of feet and inches,\r\nanswering to a perpendicular from the keel, in order to ascertain the\r\nship's draught of water forward.--_False stem._ When a ship's stem is\r\ntoo flat, so that she cannot keep a wind well, a false stem, or gripe,\r\nis fayed on before the right one, which enables her to hold a better\r\nwind.--_From stem to stern_, from one end of the ship to the other.--_To\r\nstem_, to make way against any obstacle. \"She does not stem the tide,\"\r\nthat is, she cannot make head against it for want of wind.\r\n\r\nSTEM-KNEE. In ship-building, the compass-timber which connects the keel\r\nwith the stem. (_See_ DEAD-WOOD KNEES.)\r\n\r\nSTEMSON. An arching piece of compass-timber, worked within the apron to\r\nreinforce the scarph thereof, in the same manner as the apron supports\r\nthat of the stem.

Henry V.'s fleet is sailing\r\naway:--\r\n\r\n                              \"O, do but think,\r\n    You stand upon the rivage, and behold\r\n    A city on the inconstant billows dancing;\r\n    For so appears this fleet majestical,\r\n    Holding due course to Harfleur. Follow, follow!\r\n    Grapple your minds to sternage of this navy.\"\r\n\r\nSTERN-ALL. A term amongst whalers, meaning to pull the boat stern\r\nforemost, to back off after having entered an iron (_harpoon_).\r\n\r\nSTERN-BOARD. This term is familiarly known to seamen as tacking by\r\nmisadventure in stays; or purposely, as a seamanlike measure, to effect\r\nthe object. Thus a ship in a narrow channel is allowed to fly up head to\r\nwind until her stem nearly touches a weather danger; the head-yards are\r\nthen quickly braced abox, and the helm shifted. Thus she makes stern-way\r\nuntil all the sails are full, when she is again skilfully brought to the\r\nwind before touching the danger under her lee. Generally speaking,\r\nhowever, it refers to bad seamanship.\r\n\r\nSTERN-CHASERS. The guns which fire directly aft.\r\n\r\nSTERN-DAVITS. Pieces of iron or timber projecting from the stern, with\r\nsheaves or blocks at their outer ends, for hoisting boats up to.\r\n\r\nSTERN-FAST.

There are several persons under this appellation in most ships,\r\naccording to their size, appointed to the charge of the sea-stores of\r\nthe various grades. The paymaster's steward has most to do, having to\r\nserve the crew, and therefore has assistants, distinguished by the\r\nsobriquet of Jack-o'-the-dust, &c. In large passenger ships which do not\r\ncarry a purser, part of his duties devolves upon the captain's steward.\r\nIn smaller merchant ships the special duties of the steward are not\r\nheavy, so that he assists in the working of the ship, and in tacking;\r\nhis station is, _ex officio_, the main-sheet.\r\n\r\nSTICHLING.

A large tackle, or properly pendant, hooked to the lower end\r\nof the top-mast top-rope, and to the deck, in order to increase the\r\nmechanical power in lifting the top-mast in order to fid it. It is\r\ncomposed of two strong iron-bound double or triple blocks, the hooks of\r\nwhich work on a swivel.\r\n\r\nTOP-TACKLE PENDANT. The pendant used with the above. The top-mast is\r\nswayed up by a top-rope or hawser. The pendant, which is of better\r\nmaterial, and hawser-laid, has an eye and thimble spliced in one end,\r\nand is pointed at the other.

The trusses or parrels of the lower yards serve to bind them to\r\ntheir masts and are bowsed taut when the yards are trimmed, in order to\r\narrest motion and friction. But the introduction of an iron goose-neck,\r\ncentering and securing the yard well free of the mast, very much\r\nsupersedes the use of trusses.\r\n\r\nTRUSS-HOOPS. Synonymous with clasp-hoops for masts or spars; they are\r\nopen iron hoops, so made that their ends, being let into each other, may\r\nbe well fastened by means of iron wedges or forelock keys.\r\n\r\nTRUSS-PARREL.

Close-hauled\r\nunder all sail, a vessel gains head-way within six points of the wind;\r\nbut in _trying_ she may come up to five and fall off to seven: so that a\r\nvessel does not hold her own. If the vessel be in proper trim, or\r\nproperly stowed, she will naturally keep to the wind; but custom, and\r\ndeficiency of seamanlike ability, have induced the lazy habit of lashing\r\nthe helm a-lee.\r\n\r\nTRY BACK FOR A BEND, TO. To pay back some of the bight of a cable, in\r\norder to have sufficient to form the bend.\r\n\r\nTRY DOWN, TO. To boil out the oil from blubber at sea in whalers.\r\n\r\nTRYING THE RANGE.

Those in which the flame and hot gases, after leaving\r\nthe furnaces, pass through a great number of small iron or brass tubes\r\nsurrounded by water, by which means these gases are made to impart some\r\nof their heat to the water before they escape; thus fuel is economized.\r\n\r\nTUCK. The after-part of a ship, immediately under the stern or counter,\r\nwhere the ends of the bottom planks are collected and terminate by the\r\ntuck-rail.

The variation of the needle is properly defined\r\nas the angle which a magnetic needle suspended at liberty makes with the\r\nmeridian line on a horizontal plane; or an arc of the horizon,\r\ncomprehended between the true and the magnetic meridian. (_See_ ANNUAL\r\nVARIATION.)\r\n\r\nVARIATION CHART. The well-known chart produced by Halley, whereon a\r\nnumber of curved lines show the variation of the compass in the places\r\nthey pass through.

To let out, to pay out, to turn or change. Also, to veer or\r\nwear, in contradistinction from tacking. In tacking it is a necessary\r\ncondition that the ship be brought up to the wind as close-hauled, and\r\nput round against the wind on the opposite tack. But in veering or\r\nwearing, especially when strong gales render it dangerous, unseamanlike,\r\nor impossible, the head of the vessel is put away from the wind, and\r\nturned round 20 points of the compass instead of 12, and, without strain\r\nor danger, is brought to the wind on the opposite tack. Many\r\ndeep-thinking seamen, and Lords St. Vincent, Exmouth, and Sir E. Owen,\r\nissued orders to wear instead of tacking, when not inconvenient, deeming\r\nthe accidents and wear and tear of tacking, detrimental to the sails,\r\nspars, and rigging.\r\n\r\nVEER A BUOY IN A SHIP'S WAKE, TO.

To gently tauten and then slacken a rope three times\r\nbefore giving a heavy pull, the object being to concentrate the force of\r\nseveral men. The wind is said to veer and haul when it alters its\r\ndirection; thus it is said, to veer aft, and haul forward.\r\n\r\nVEER AWAY THE CABLE, TO. To slack and let it run out.\r\n\r\nVEERING CABLE, THE. That cable which is veered out in unmooring, and not\r\nunspliced or unshackled in clearing hawse.\r\n\r\nVEGA. {a} Lyrae.

Also, a very limited current of wind--a cat's-paw.\r\n\r\nVELOCITY. In naval architecture, designing for velocity is giving that\r\nform to a ship's body by which she will pass through the water in the\r\nquickest space of time.\r\n\r\nVELOCITY OF TIDE OR CURRENT, depends on several circumstances. First,\r\nthe tide varies with the state of the moon, running strongest at the\r\nsprings, and the force of the ebb is much increased by rains, land\r\nfreshes, &c. The currents also vary, especially when wind and tide\r\ncombine to accelerate their action.\r\n\r\nVENDAVAL [Sp. south wind, _tiempo di vendavales_].

In artillery, that directed upward at such an angle as\r\nthat it will fall vertically, or nearly so, to its destination. It\r\nincludes all elevations above 30 deg., though the most usual is 45 deg.\r\nIt is very effective with shells; but with small balls, as proposed by\r\nCarnot and others, who have ill reckoned the retardation by the\r\natmosphere, it is insignificant.\r\n\r\nVERTICAL FORCE. The centre of displacement is also that of the centre of\r\nvertical force that the water exerts to support the immersed vessel.\r\nAlso, the dip of the magnetic needle, measured by vibrations of the\r\ndipping needle over certain arcs, and referable to some fixed position,\r\nas Greenwich, where corresponding observations with the same needle have\r\nbeen previously, as well as subsequently, made.\r\n\r\nVERTICAL PLAN. _See_ ORTHOGRAPHIC PROJECTION.\r\n\r\nVERTICITY.

A vessel which carries provisions. In the early age of the\r\nnavy, each man-of-war had a victualler especially attached to her; as,\r\nin Henry VIII.'s reign, we find the _Nicholas Draper_, of 140 tons and\r\n40 men, was victualler to the _Trinity Sovereign_; the _Barbara_ of\r\nGreenwich to the _Gabriel Royal_, and so on.\r\n\r\nVICTUALLING-BILL.

A large single-sheaved block through which the\r\nmessenger passed when the anchor was weighed by the fore or jeer\r\ncapstan; its block was usually lashed to the main-mast. This\r\nvoyol-purchase was afterwards improved thus: the voyol-block was\r\nsecurely lashed to the cable at the manger-board, the jeer-fall rove\r\nthrough it, and brought to the jeer-capstan, and the standing part\r\nbelayed to the bitts; thus a direct runner purchase instead of a dead\r\nnip was obtained.

Is sometimes the same as the ship's _rake_ or _run_, forward or\r\nbackward, but is most commonly understood of her sailing. _Way_ is often\r\nused for _wake_. Thus when she begins her motion she is said to be\r\n_under way_; and when that motion increases, to have _fresh-way_ through\r\nthe water. Hence, also, she is said to have _head-way_ or _stern-way_,\r\nto _gather way_ or to _lose way_, &c. (_See_ WIND'S-WAY.)--_Gangway_,\r\nmeans a clear space to pass.

It is a\r\nword also applied to everything lying to windward of a particular\r\nsituation, hence a ship is said to have the weather-gage of another\r\nwhen further to windward. Thus also, when a ship under sail presents\r\neither of her sides to the wind, it is then called the _weather-side_,\r\nand all the rigging situated thereon is distinguished by the same\r\nepithet. It is the opposite of _lee_. To weather anything is to go to\r\nwindward of it. The land to windward, is a weather shore.\r\n\r\nWEATHER-ANCHOR.

A general term for various marine animals of the order _Cetacea_,\r\nincluding the most colossal of all animated beings. From their general\r\nform and mode of life they are frequently confounded with fish, from\r\nwhich, however, they differ essentially in their organization, as they\r\nare warm-blooded, ascend to the surface to breathe air, produce their\r\nyoung alive, and suckle them, as do the land mammalia. The cetacea are\r\ndivided into two sections:--1. Those having horny plates, called baleen,\r\nor \"whalebone,\" growing from the palate instead of teeth, and including\r\nthe right whales and rorquals, or finners and hump-backs (see these\r\nterms). 2. Those having true teeth and no whalebone. To this group\r\nbelong the sperm-whale, and the various forms of bottle-noses,\r\nblack-fish, grampuses, narwhals, dolphins, porpoises, &c. To the larger\r\nspecies of many of these the term \"whale\" is often applied.\r\n\r\nWHALE-BIRD.

But the constant persecution to which these animals are\r\nsubjected causes a frequent change in their habitats. They have been\r\nnearly exterminated, or rendered so scarce as not to be worth following,\r\nin many districts where they formerly most abounded, and in order to\r\nmake the trade remunerative, new grounds have to be continually sought.\r\nMaury's \"whale charts\" give much valuable information on this subject.\r\n\r\nWHALER.

The dues for landing or shipping goods at a wharf;\r\ncustoms charges in particular. Thus for goods not liable to duty, and\r\nforcibly taken for examination, wharfage charges are demanded even from\r\na ship of war!\r\n\r\nWHARFINGER. He who owns or keeps a wharf and takes account of all the\r\narticles landed thereon or removed from it, for which he receives a\r\ncertain fee.\r\n\r\nWHARF-STEAD.

A small machine attached to the old musket for producing\r\nsparks of fire.\r\n\r\nWHEEL-ROPES. Ropes rove through a block on each side of the deck, and\r\nled round the barrel of the steering-wheel. Chains are also used for\r\nthis purpose.\r\n\r\nWHEELS. _See_ TRUCKS.\r\n\r\nWHEFT. More commonly written _waft_ (which see).

The brackets or projecting parts which rise out of the barrel or\r\nmain body of the capstan, like buttresses, to enlarge the sweep, so that\r\na greater portion of the cable, or whatever rope encircles the barrel,\r\nmay be wound about it at one turn without adding much to the weight of\r\nthe capstan. The whelps reach downwards from the lower part of the\r\ndrumhead to the deck.

The wherries allowed to ply about\r\nLondon are either scullers worked by one man with two sculls, or by two\r\nmen, each pulling an oar. Also, a decked vessel used in fishing in\r\ndifferent parts of Great Britain and Ireland: numbers of them were\r\nnotorious smugglers.\r\n\r\nWHETHER OR NO, TOM COLLINS.

A revolving current of wind of small diameter that rises\r\nsuddenly, but is soon spent.\r\n\r\nWHISKERS. Two booms, half-yards, or iron spars projecting on each side\r\nbefore the cat-heads; they are for spreading the guys of the jib-boom,\r\ninstead of having a spritsail-yard across. In many vessels the\r\nsprit-sail (then termed spread-yard) is lashed across the forecastle so\r\nas to rest before the cat-heads on the gunwale, and the guys rove\r\nthrough holes bored in it, and set up in the fore-channels.\r\n\r\nWHISTLE.

They are pretty regular in the North Atlantic, as\r\nfar as 5 deg. N., where calms may be expected, or the south-east trade\r\nmay reach across, depending on the season; but when near land they yield\r\nto the _land and sea breezes_. Thus at 10 deg. N. the land-breeze will be\r\nat E. from 11 P.M. until 6 A.M., then calm intervenes up to 10 A.M., when\r\nthe sea-breeze sets in, probably W., and blows home fresh. Yet at 20\r\nmiles off shore the trade-wind may blow pretty strong from N.E. or\r\nE.N.E.--The _harmattan_ is a sudden dry wind blowing off the coast of\r\nAfrica, so charged with almost impalpable dust that the sun is obscured.\r\nIt sucks up all moisture, cracks furniture and earthenware, and\r\nprostrates animal nature. The rigging of vessels becomes a dirty brown,\r\nand the dust adhering to the blacking cannot be removed.--The _tornado_\r\nlasts for a short time, but is of great force during its continuance.--The\r\n_northers_ in the Gulf of Mexico, or off the Heads of Virginia, are not\r\nonly very heavy gales, but are attended with severe cold.

The\r\nnorther came on about midnight, and at 8 A.M. the temperature had fallen\r\nto 12 deg., and icicles were hanging from the eaves of the houses. The\r\n_Tiempo di Vendavales_, or southers of Western America, is an opposite,\r\nblowing heavily home to the coast.

This term is particularly used in the stowage of the several\r\nmaterials contained in the hold, and between the cable-tiers and the\r\nship's sides. In ships of war they are usually kept clear, that the\r\ncarpenter and his crew may have access round the ship to stop shot-holes\r\nin time of action. Also, the skirts or extremities of a fleet, when\r\nranged in a line abreast, or when forming two sides of a triangle. It is\r\nusual to extend the wings of a fleet in the daytime, in order to\r\ndiscover any enemy that may fall in their track; they are, however,\r\ngenerally summoned by signal to form close order before night. In\r\nmilitary parlance, the right and left divisions of a force, whether\r\nthese leave a centre division between them or not.--_Wing-transom._ The\r\nuppermost transom in the stern-frame, to which the heels of the\r\ncounter-timbers are let on and bolted.\r\n\r\nWING UP BALLAST, TO.

A number of these\r\nare twisted together to form a strand, in proportion to the size of the\r\nproposed rope. Three strands are then twisted into one another, which\r\ncompletes the process of ordinary rope-making; but cables, hawsers, and\r\nother ground tackling, are composed of three strands, each of which is\r\nformed of three lesser ones. (_See_ CABLE, HAWSER, &c.)--_A tough yarn._\r\nA long story, or tale, hard to be believed.\r\n\r\nYARN-SPINNING. A figurative expression for telling a story.\r\n\r\nYATAGHAN.
