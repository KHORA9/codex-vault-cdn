C. In a treatise of about that time entitled\r\n\"Pneumatica\", Hero, of Alexander, described not only existing devices of\r\nhis predecessors and contemporaries but also an invention of his own\r\nwhich utilized the expansive force of steam for raising water above its\r\nnatural level. He clearly describes three methods in which steam might\r\nbe used directly as a motive of power; raising water by its elasticity,\r\nelevating a weight by its expansive power and producing a rotary motion\r\nby its reaction on the atmosphere. The third method, which is known as\r\n\"Hero's engine\", is described as a hollow sphere supported over a\r\ncaldron or boiler by two trunnions, one of which was hollow, and\r\nconnected the interior of the sphere with the steam space of the\r\ncaldron. Two pipes, open at the ends and bent at right angles, were\r\ninserted at opposite poles of the sphere, forming a connection between\r\nthe caldron and the atmosphere. Heat being applied to the caldron, the\r\nsteam generated passed through the hollow trunnion to the sphere and\r\nthence into the atmosphere through the two pipes. By the reaction\r\nincidental to its escape through these pipes, the sphere was caused to\r\nrotate and here is the primitive steam reaction turbine.\r\n\r\nHero makes no suggestions as to application of any of the devices he\r\ndescribes to a useful purpose. From the time of Hero until the late\r\nsixteenth and early seventeenth centuries, there is no record of\r\nprogress, though evidence is found that such devices as were described\r\nby Hero were sometimes used for trivial purposes, the blowing of an\r\norgan or the turning of a skillet.\r\n\r\nMathesius, the German author, in 1571; Besson, a philosopher and\r\nmathematician at Orleans; Ramelli, in 1588; Battista Delia Porta, a\r\nNeapolitan mathematician and philosopher, in 1601; Decause, the French\r\nengineer and architect, in 1615; and Branca, an Italian architect, in\r\n1629, all published treatises bearing on the subject of the generation\r\nof steam.\r\n\r\nTo the next contributor, Edward Somerset, second Marquis of Worcester,\r\nis apparently due the credit of proposing, if not of making, the first\r\nuseful steam engine. In the \"Century of Scantlings and Inventions\",\r\npublished in London in 1663, he describes devices showing that he had in\r\nmind the raising of water not only by forcing it from two receivers by\r\ndirect steam pressure but also for some sort of reciprocating piston\r\nactuating one end of a lever, the other operating a pump. His\r\ndescriptions are rather obscure and no drawings are extant so that it is\r\ndifficult to say whether there were any distinctly novel features to his\r\ndevices aside from the double action. While there is no direct authentic\r\nrecord that any of the devices he described were actually constructed,\r\nit is claimed by many that he really built and operated a steam engine\r\ncontaining pistons.\r\n\r\nIn 1675, Sir Samuel Moreland was decorated by King Charles II, for a\r\ndemonstration of \"a certain powerful machine to raise water.\" Though\r\nthere appears to be no record of the design of this machine, the\r\nmathematical dictionary, published in 1822, credits Moreland with the\r\nfirst account of a steam engine, on which subject he wrote a treatise\r\nthat is still preserved in the British Museum.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 397 Horse-power Babcock & Wilcox Boiler in Course of\r\nErection at the Plant of the Crocker Wheeler Co., Ampere, N. J.]\r\n\r\nDr. Denys Papin, an ingenious Frenchman, invented in 1680 \"a steam\r\ndigester for extracting marrowy, nourishing juices from bones by\r\nenclosing them in a boiler under heavy pressure,\" and finding danger\r\nfrom explosion, added a contrivance which is the first safety valve on\r\nrecord.\r\n\r\nThe steam engine first became commercially successful with Thomas\r\nSavery. In 1699, Savery exhibited before the Royal Society of England\r\n(Sir Isaac Newton was President at the time), a model engine which\r\nconsisted of two copper receivers alternately connected by a three-way\r\nhand-operated valve, with a boiler and a source of water supply. When\r\nthe water in one receiver had been driven out by the steam, cold water\r\nwas poured over its outside surface, creating a vacuum through\r\ncondensation and causing it to fill again while the water in the other\r\nreservoir was being forced out. A number of machines were built on this\r\nprinciple and placed in actual use as mine pumps.\r\n\r\nThe serious difficulty encountered in the use of Savery's engine was the\r\nfact that the height to which it could lift water was limited by the\r\npressure the boiler and vessels could bear. Before Savery's engine was\r\nentirely displaced by its successor, Newcomen's, it was considerably\r\nimproved by Desaguliers, who applied the Papin safety valve to the\r\nboiler and substituted condensation by a jet within the vessel for\r\nSavery's surface condensation.\r\n\r\nIn 1690, Papin suggested that the condensation of steam should be\r\nemployed to make a vacuum beneath a cylinder which had previously been\r\nraised by the expansion of steam. This was the earliest cylinder and\r\npiston steam engine and his plan took practical shape in Newcomen's\r\natmospheric engine. Papin's first engine was unworkable owing to the\r\nfact that he used the same vessel for both boiler and cylinder. A small\r\nquantity of water was placed in the bottom of the vessel and heat was\r\napplied. When steam formed and raised the piston, the heat was withdrawn\r\nand the piston did work on its down stroke under pressure of the\r\natmosphere. After hearing of Savery's engine, Papin developed an\r\nimproved form. Papin's engine of 1705 consisted of a displacement\r\nchamber in which a floating diaphragm or piston on top of the water kept\r\nthe steam and water from direct contact. The water delivered by the\r\ndownward movement of the piston under pressure, to a closed tank, flowed\r\nin a continuous stream against the vanes of a water wheel. When the\r\nsteam in the displacement chamber had expanded, it was exhausted to the\r\natmosphere through a valve instead of being condensed. The engine was,\r\nin fact, a non-condensing, single action steam pump with the steam and\r\npump cylinders in one. A curious feature of this engine was a heater\r\nplaced in the diaphragm. This was a mass of heated metal for the purpose\r\nof keeping the steam dry or preventing condensation during expansion.\r\nThis device might be called the first superheater.\r\n\r\nAmong the various inventions attributed to Papin was a boiler with an\r\ninternal fire box, the earliest record of such construction.\r\n\r\nWhile Papin had neglected his earlier suggestion of a steam and piston\r\nengine to work on Savery's ideas, Thomas Newcomen, with his assistant,\r\nJohn Cawley, put into practical form Papin's suggestion of 1690. Steam\r\nadmitted from the boiler to a cylinder raised a piston by its expansion,\r\nassisted by a counter-weight on the other end of a beam actuated by the\r\npiston. The steam valve was then shut and the steam condensed by a jet\r\nof cold water. The piston was then forced downward by atmospheric\r\npressure and did work on the pump. The condensed water in the cylinder\r\nwas expelled through an escapement valve by the next entry of steam.\r\nThis engine used steam having pressure but little, if any, above that of\r\nthe atmosphere.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Two Units of 8128 Horse Power of Babcock & Wilcox Boilers\r\nand Superheaters at the Fisk Street Station of the Commonwealth Edison\r\nCo., Chicago, Ill., 50,400 Horse Power being Installed in this Station.\r\nThe Commonwealth Edison Co. Operates in its Various Stations a Total of\r\n86,000 Horse Power of Babcock & Wilcox Boilers, all Fitted with Babcock\r\n& Wilcox Superheaters and Equipped with Babcock & Wilcox Chain Grate\r\nStokers]\r\n\r\nIn 1711, this engine was introduced into mines for pumping purposes.\r\nWhether its action was originally automatic or whether dependent upon\r\nthe hand operation of the valves is a question of doubt. The story\r\ncommonly believed is that a boy, Humphrey Potter, in 1713, whose duty it\r\nwas to open and shut such valves of an engine he attended, by suitable\r\ncords and catches attached to the beam, caused the engine to\r\nautomatically manipulate these valves. This device was simplified in\r\n1718 by Henry Beighton, who suspended from the bottom, a rod called the\r\nplug-tree, which actuated the valve by tappets. By 1725, this engine was\r\nin common use in the collieries and was changed but little for a matter\r\nof sixty or seventy years. Compared with Savery's engine, from the\r\naspect of a pumping engine, Newcomen's was a distinct advance, in that\r\nthe pressure in the pumps was in no manner dependent upon the steam\r\npressure. In common with Savery's engine, the losses from the alternate\r\nheating and cooling of the steam cylinder were enormous. Though\r\nobviously this engine might have been modified to serve many purposes,\r\nits use seems to have been limited almost entirely to the pumping of\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nThe rivalry between Savery and Papin appears to have stimulated\r\nattention to the question of fuel saving. Dr. John Allen, in 1730,\r\ncalled attention to the fact that owing to the short length of time of\r\nthe contact between the gases and the heating surfaces of the boiler,\r\nnearly half of the heat of the fire was lost. With a view to overcoming\r\nthis loss at least partially, he used an internal furnace with a smoke\r\nflue winding through the water in the form of a worm in a still. In\r\norder that the length of passage of the gases might not act as a damper\r\non the fire, Dr. Allen recommended the use of a pair of bellows for\r\nforcing the sluggish vapor through the flue. This is probably the first\r\nsuggested use of forced draft. In forming an estimate of the quantity of\r\nfuel lost up the stack, Dr. Allen probably made the first boiler test.\r\n\r\nToward the end of the period of use of Newcomen's atmospheric engine,\r\nJohn Smeaton, who, about 1770, built and installed a number of large\r\nengines of this type, greatly improved the design in its mechanical\r\ndetails.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Erie County Electric Co., Erie, Pa., Operating 3082 Horse\r\nPower of Babcock & Wilcox Boilers and Superheaters, Equipped with\r\nBabcock & Wilcox Chain Grate Stokers]\r\n\r\nThe improvement in boiler and engine design of Smeaton, Newcomen and\r\ntheir contemporaries, were followed by those of the great engineer,\r\nJames Watt, an instrument maker of Glasgow. In 1763, while repairing a\r\nmodel of Newcomen's engine, he was impressed by the great waste of steam\r\nto which the alternating cooling and heating of the engine gave rise.\r\nHis remedy was the maintaining of the cylinder as hot as the entering\r\nsteam and with this in view he added a vessel separate from the\r\ncylinder, into which the steam should pass from the cylinder and be\r\nthere condensed either by the application of cold water outside or by a\r\njet from within. To preserve a vacuum in his condenser, he added an air\r\npump which should serve to remove the water of condensation and air\r\nbrought in with the injection water or due to leakage. As the cylinder\r\nno longer acted as a condenser, he could maintain it at a high\r\ntemperature by covering it with non-conducting material and, in\r\nparticular, by the use of a steam jacket. Further and with the same\r\nobject in view, he covered the top of the cylinder and introduced steam\r\nabove the piston to do the work previously accomplished by atmospheric\r\npressure. After several trials with an experimental apparatus based on\r\nthese ideas, Watt patented his improvements in 1769. Aside from their\r\nhistorical importance, Watt's improvements, as described in his\r\nspecification, are to this day a statement of the principles which guide\r\nthe scientific development of the steam engine. His words are:\r\n\r\n    \"My method of lessening the consumption of steam, and\r\n    consequently fuel, in fire engines, consists of the following\r\n    principles:\r\n\r\n    \"First, That vessel in which the powers of steam are to be\r\n    employed to work the engine, which is called the cylinder in\r\n    common fire engines, and which I call the steam vessel, must,\r\n    during the whole time the engine is at work, be kept as hot as\r\n    the steam that enters it; first, by enclosing it in a case of\r\n    wood, or any other materials that transmit heat slowly;\r\n    secondly, by surrounding it with steam or other heated bodies;\r\n    and, thirdly, by suffering neither water nor any other substance\r\n    colder than the steam to enter or touch it during that time.\r\n\r\n    \"Secondly, In engines that are to be worked wholly or partially\r\n    by condensation of steam, the steam is to be condensed in\r\n    vessels distinct from the steam vessels or cylinders, although\r\n    occasionally communicating with them; these vessels I call\r\n    condensers; and, whilst the engines are working, these\r\n    condensers ought at least to be kept as cold as the air in the\r\n    neighborhood of the engines, by application of water or other\r\n    cold bodies.\r\n\r\n    \"Thirdly, Whatever air or other elastic vapor is not condensed\r\n    by the cold of the condenser, and may impede the working of the\r\n    engine, is to be drawn out of the steam vessels or condensers by\r\n    means of pumps, wrought by the engines themselves, or otherwise.\r\n\r\n    \"Fourthly, I intend in many cases to employ the expansive force\r\n    of steam to press on the pistons, or whatever may be used\r\n    instead of them, in the same manner in which the pressure of the\r\n    atmosphere is now employed in common fire engines. In cases\r\n    where cold water cannot be had in plenty, the engines may be\r\n    wrought by this force of steam only, by discharging the steam\r\n    into the air after it has done its office....\r\n\r\n    \"Sixthly, I intend in some cases to apply a degree of cold not\r\n    capable of reducing the steam to water, but of contracting it\r\n    considerably, so that the engines shall be worked by the\r\n    alternate expansion and contraction of the steam.\r\n\r\n    \"Lastly, Instead of using water to render the pistons and other\r\n    parts of the engine air and steam tight, I employ oils, wax,\r\n    resinous bodies, fat of animals, quick-silver and other metals\r\n    in their fluid state.\"\r\n\r\nThe fifth claim was for a rotary engine, and need not be quoted here.\r\n\r\nThe early efforts of Watt are typical of those of the poor inventor\r\nstruggling with insufficient resources to gain recognition and it was\r\nnot until he became associated with the wealthy manufacturer, Mattheu\r\nBoulton of Birmingham, that he met with the success upon which his\r\npresent fame is based. In partnership with Boulton, the business of the\r\nmanufacture and the sale of his engines were highly successful in spite\r\nof vigorous attacks on the validity of his patents.\r\n\r\nThough the fourth claim of Watt's patent describes a non-condensing\r\nengine which would require high pressures, his aversion to such practice\r\nwas strong. Notwithstanding his entire knowledge of the advantages\r\nthrough added expansion under high pressure, he continued to use\r\npressures not above 7 pounds per square inch above the atmosphere. To\r\novercome such pressures, his boilers were fed through a stand-pipe of\r\nsufficient height to have the column of water offset the pressure within\r\nthe boiler. Watt's attitude toward high pressure made his influence felt\r\nlong after his patents had expired.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Portion of 9600 Horse-power Installation of Babcock &\r\nWilcox Boilers and Superheaters, Equipped with Babcock & Wilcox Chain\r\nGrate Stokers at the Blue Island, Ill., Plant of the Public Service Co.\r\nof Northern Illinois. This Company Operates 14,580 Horse Power of\r\nBabcock & Wilcox Boilers and Superheaters in its Various Stations]\r\n\r\nIn 1782, Watt patented two other features which he had invented as early\r\nas 1769. These were the double acting engine, that is, the use of steam\r\non both sides of the piston and the use of steam expansively, that is,\r\nthe shutting off of steam from the cylinder when the piston had made but\r\na portion of its stroke, the power for the completion of the stroke\r\nbeing supplied by the expansive force of the steam already admitted.\r\n\r\nHe further added a throttle valve for the regulation of steam admission,\r\ninvented the automatic governor and the steam indicator, a mercury steam\r\ngauge and a glass water column.\r\n\r\nIt has been the object of this brief history of the early developments\r\nin the use of steam to cover such developments only through the time of\r\nJames Watt. The progress of the steam engine from this time through the\r\nstages of higher pressures, combining of cylinders, the application of\r\nsteam vehicles and steamboats, the adding of third and fourth cylinders,\r\nto the invention of the turbine with its development and the\r\naccompanying development of the reciprocating engine to hold its place,\r\nis one long attribute to the inventive genius of man.\r\n\r\nWhile little is said in the biographies of Watt as to the improvement of\r\nsteam boilers, all the evidence indicates that Boulton and Watt\r\nintroduced the first \"wagon boiler\", so called because of its shape. In\r\n1785, Watt took out a number of patents for variations in furnace\r\nconstruction, many of which contain the basic principles of some of the\r\nmodern smoke preventing furnaces. Until the early part of the nineteenth\r\ncentury, the low steam pressures used caused but little attention to be\r\ngiven to the form of the boiler operated in connection with the engines\r\nabove described. About 1800, Richard Trevithick, in England, and Oliver\r\nEvans, in America, introduced non-condensing, and for that time, high\r\npressure steam engines. To the initiative of Evans may be attributed the\r\ngeneral use of high pressure steam in the United States, a feature which\r\nfor many years distinguished American from European practice. The demand\r\nfor light weight and economy of space following the beginning of steam\r\nnavigation and the invention of the locomotive required boilers designed\r\nand constructed to withstand heavier pressures and forced the adoption\r\nof the cylindrical form of boiler. There are in use to-day many examples\r\nof every step in the development of steam boilers from the first plain\r\ncylindrical boiler to the most modern type of multi-tubular locomotive\r\nboiler, which stands as the highest type of fire-tube boiler\r\nconstruction.\r\n\r\nThe early attempts to utilize water-tube boilers were few. A brief\r\nhistory of the development of the boilers, in which this principle was\r\nemployed, is given in the following chapter. From this history it will\r\nbe clearly indicated that the first commercially successful utilization\r\nof water tubes in a steam generator is properly attributed to George H.\r\nBabcock and Stephen Wilcox.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Copyright by Underwood & Underwood\r\n\r\nWoolworth Building, New York City, Operating 2454 Horse Power of\r\nBabcock & Wilcox Boilers]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBRIEF HISTORY OF WATER-TUBE BOILERS[1]\r\n\r\n\r\nAs stated in the previous chapter, the first water-tube boiler was built\r\nby John Blakey and was patented by him in 1766. Several tubes\r\nalternately inclined at opposite angles were arranged in the furnaces,\r\nthe adjacent tube ends being connected by small pipes. The first\r\nsuccessful user of water-tube boilers, however, was James Rumsey, an\r\nAmerican inventor, celebrated for his early experiments in steam\r\nnavigation, and it is he who may be truly classed as the originator of\r\nthe water-tube boiler. In 1788 he patented, in England, several forms of\r\nboilers, some of which were of the water-tube type. One had a fire box\r\nwith flat top and sides, with horizontal tubes across the fire box\r\nconnecting the water spaces. Another had a cylindrical fire box\r\nsurrounded by an annular water space and a coiled tube was placed within\r\nthe box connecting at its two ends with the water space. This was the\r\nfirst of the \"coil boilers\". Another form in the same patent was the\r\nvertical tubular boiler, practically as made at the present time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Blakey, 1766]\r\n\r\nThe first boiler made of a combination of small tubes, connected at one\r\nend to a reservoir, was the invention of another American, John Stevens,\r\nin 1804. This boiler was actually employed to generate steam for running\r\na steamboat on the Hudson River, but like all the \"porcupine\" boilers,\r\nof which type it was the first, it did not have the elements of a\r\ncontinued success.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: John Stevens, 1804]\r\n\r\nAnother form of water tube was patented in 1805 by John Cox Stevens, a\r\nson of John Stevens. This boiler consisted of twenty vertical tubes, 1¼\r\ninches internal diameter and 40½ inches long, arranged in a circle, the\r\noutside diameter of which was approximately 12 inches, connecting a\r\nwater chamber at the bottom with a steam chamber at the top. The steam\r\nand water chambers were annular spaces of small cross section and\r\ncontained approximately 33 cubic inches. The illustration shows the cap\r\nof the steam chamber secured by bolts. The steam outlet pipe \"A\" is a\r\npipe of one inch diameter, the water entering through a similar aperture\r\nat the bottom. One of these boilers was for a long time at the Stevens\r\nInstitute of Technology at Hoboken, and is now in the Smithsonian\r\nInstitute at Washington.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: John Cox Stevens, 1805]\r\n\r\nAbout the same time, Jacob Woolf built a boiler of large horizontal\r\ntubes, extending across the furnace and connected at the ends to a\r\nlongitudinal drum above. The first purely sectional water-tube boiler\r\nwas built by Julius Griffith, in 1821. In this boiler, a number of\r\nhorizontal water tubes were connected to vertical side pipes, the side\r\npipes were connected to horizontal gathering pipes, and these latter in\r\nturn to a steam drum.\r\n\r\nIn 1822, Jacob Perkins constructed a flash boiler for carrying what was\r\nthen considered a high pressure. A number of cast-iron bars having 1½\r\ninches annular holes through them and connected at their outer ends by a\r\nseries of bent pipes, outside of the furnace walls, were arranged in\r\nthree tiers over the fire. The water was fed slowly to the upper tier by\r\na force pump and steam in the superheated state was discharged to the\r\nlower tiers into a chamber from which it was taken to the engine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Joseph Eve, 1825]\r\n\r\nThe first sectional water-tube boiler, with a well-defined circulation,\r\nwas built by Joseph Eve, in 1825. The sections were composed of small\r\ntubes with a slight double curve, but being practically vertical, fixed\r\nin horizontal headers, which headers were in turn connected to a steam\r\nspace above and a water space below formed of larger pipes. The steam\r\nand water spaces were connected by outside pipes to secure a circulation\r\nof the water up through the sections and down through the external\r\npipes. In the same year, John M'Curdy of New York, built a \"Duplex Steam\r\nGenerator\" of \"tubes of wrought or cast iron or other material\" arranged\r\nin several horizontal rows, connected together alternately at the front\r\nand rear by return bends. In the tubes below the water line were placed\r\ninterior circular vessels closed at the ends in order to expose a thin\r\nsheet of water to the action of the fire.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Gurney, 1826]\r\n\r\nIn 1826, Goldsworthy Gurney built a number of boilers, which he used on\r\nhis steam carriages. A number of small tubes were bent into the shape of\r\na \"U\" laid sidewise and the ends were connected with larger horizontal\r\npipes. These were connected by vertical pipes to permit of circulation\r\nand also to a vertical cylinder which served as a steam and water\r\nreservoir. In 1828, Paul Steenstrup made the first shell boiler with\r\nvertical water tubes in the large flues, similar to the boiler known as\r\nthe \"Martin\" and suggesting the \"Galloway\".\r\n\r\nThe first water-tube boiler having fire tubes within water tubes was\r\nbuilt in 1830, by Summers & Ogle. Horizontal connections at the top and\r\nbottom were connected by a series of vertical water tubes, through which\r\nwere fire tubes extending through the horizontal connections, the fire\r\ntubes being held in place by nuts, which also served to make the joint.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Stephen Wilcox, 1856]\r\n\r\nStephen Wilcox, in 1856, was the first to use inclined water tubes\r\nconnecting water spaces at the front and rear with a steam space above.\r\nThe first to make such inclined tubes into a sectional form was Twibill,\r\nin 1865. He used wrought-iron tubes connected at the front and rear with\r\nstandpipes through intermediate connections. These standpipes carried\r\nthe system to a horizontal cross drum at the top, the entrained water\r\nbeing carried to the rear.\r\n\r\nClarke, Moore, McDowell, Alban and others worked on the problem of\r\nconstructing water-tube boilers, but because of difficulties of\r\nconstruction involved, met with no practical success.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Twibill, 1865]\r\n\r\nIt may be asked why water-tube boilers did not come into more general\r\nuse at an early date, that is, why the number of water-tube boilers\r\nbuilt was so small in comparison to the number of shell boilers. The\r\nreason for this is found in the difficulties involved in the design and\r\nconstruction of water-tube boilers, which design and construction\r\nrequired a high class of engineering and workmanship, while the plain\r\ncylindrical boiler is comparatively easy to build. The greater skill\r\nrequired to make a water-tube boiler successful is readily shown in the\r\ngreat number of failures in the attempts to make them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Partial View of 7000 Horse-power Installation of Babcock\r\n& Wilcox Boilers at the Philadelphia, Pa., Plant of the Baldwin\r\nLocomotive Works.

In most cases, although full\r\ncompliance with one or more of the requirements was structurally\r\nimpossible, the reader was left to infer that the boiler under\r\nconsideration possessed all the desirable features. It is noteworthy\r\nthat this list of requirements, as prepared by George H. Babcock and\r\nStephen Wilcox, in 1875, represents the best practice of to-day.\r\nMoreover, coupled with the boiler itself, which is used in the largest\r\nand most important steam generating plants throughout the world, the\r\nlist forms a fitting monument to the foresight and genius of the\r\ninventors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREQUIREMENTS OF A PERFECT STEAM BOILER\r\n\r\n\r\n1st. Proper workmanship and simple construction, using materials which\r\nexperience has shown to be the best, thus avoiding the necessity of\r\nearly repairs.\r\n\r\n\r\n2nd. A mud drum to receive all impurities deposited from the water, and\r\nso placed as to be removed from the action of the fire.\r\n\r\n\r\n3rd. A steam and water capacity sufficient to prevent any fluctuation in\r\nsteam pressure or water level.\r\n\r\n\r\n4th. A water surface for the disengagement of the steam from the water,\r\nof sufficient extent to prevent foaming.\r\n\r\n\r\n5th. A constant and thorough circulation of water throughout the boiler,\r\nso as to maintain all parts at the same temperature.\r\n\r\n\r\n6th. The water space divided into sections so arranged that, should any\r\nsection fail, no general explosion can occur and the destructive effects\r\nwill be confined to the escape of the contents. Large and free passages\r\nbetween the different sections to equalize the water line and pressure\r\nin all.\r\n\r\n\r\n7th. A great excess of strength over any legitimate strain, the boiler\r\nbeing so constructed as to be free from strains due to unequal\r\nexpansion, and, if possible, to avoid joints exposed to the direct\r\naction of the fire.\r\n\r\n\r\n8th. A combustion chamber so arranged that the combustion of the gases\r\nstarted in the furnace may be completed before the gases escape to the\r\nchimney.\r\n\r\n\r\n9th. The heating surface as nearly as possible at right angles to the\r\ncurrents of heated gases, so as to break up the currents and extract the\r\nentire available heat from the gases.\r\n\r\n\r\n10th. All parts readily accessible for cleaning and repairs. This is a\r\npoint of the greatest importance as regards safety and economy.\r\n\r\n\r\n11th. Proportioned for the work to be done, and capable of working to\r\nits full rated capacity with the highest economy.\r\n\r\n\r\n12th. Equipped with the very best gauges, safety valves and other\r\nfixtures.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe exhaustive study made of each one of these requirements is shown by\r\nthe following extract from a lecture delivered by Mr. Geo. H. Babcock at\r\nCornell University in 1890 upon the subject:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CIRCULATION OF WATER IN STEAM BOILERS\r\n\r\n\r\nYou have all noticed a kettle of water boiling over the fire, the fluid\r\nrising somewhat tumultuously around the edges of the vessel, and\r\ntumbling toward the center, where it descends. Similar currents are in\r\naction while the water is simply being heated, but they are not\r\nperceptible unless there are floating particles in the liquid. These\r\ncurrents are caused by the joint action of the added temperature and two\r\nor more qualities which the water possesses.\r\n\r\n1st. Water, in common with most other substances, expands when heated; a\r\nstatement, however, strictly true only when referred to a temperature\r\nabove 39 degrees F. or 4 degrees C., but as in the making of steam we\r\nrarely have to do with temperatures so low as that, we may, for our\r\npresent purposes, ignore that exception.\r\n\r\n2nd. Water is practically a non-conductor of heat, though not entirely\r\nso. If ice-cold water was kept boiling at the surface the heat would not\r\npenetrate sufficiently to begin melting ice at a depth of 3 inches in\r\nless than about two hours. As, therefore, the heated water cannot impart\r\nits heat to its neighboring particles, it remains expanded and rises by\r\nits levity, while colder portions come to be heated in turn, thus\r\nsetting up currents in the fluid.\r\n\r\nNow, when all the water has been heated to the boiling point\r\ncorresponding to the pressure to which it is subjected, each added unit\r\nof heat converts a portion, about 7 grains in weight, into vapor,\r\ngreatly increasing its volume; and the mingled steam and water rises\r\nmore rapidly still, producing ebullition such as we have noticed in the\r\nkettle. So long as the quantity of heat added to the contents of the\r\nkettle continues practically constant, the conditions remain similar to\r\nthose we noticed at first, a tumultuous lifting of the water around the\r\nedges, flowing toward the center and thence downward; if, however, the\r\nfire be quickened, the upward currents interfere with the downward and\r\nthe kettle boils over (Fig. 1).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1]\r\n\r\nIf now we put in the kettle a vessel somewhat smaller (Fig. 2) with a\r\nhole in the bottom and supported at a proper distance from the side so\r\nas to separate the upward from the downward currents, we can force the\r\nfires to a very much greater extent without causing the kettle to boil\r\nover, and when we place a deflecting plate so as to guide the rising\r\ncolumn toward the center it will be almost impossible to produce that\r\neffect. This is the invention of Perkins in 1831 and forms the basis of\r\nvery many of the arrangements for producing free circulation of the\r\nwater in boilers which have been made since that time. It consists in\r\ndividing the currents so that they will not interfere each with the\r\nother.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2]\r\n\r\nBut what is the object of facilitating the circulation of water in\r\nboilers? Why may we not safely leave this to the unassisted action of\r\nnature as we do in culinary operations? We may, if we do not care for\r\nthe three most important aims in steam-boiler construction, namely,\r\nefficiency, durability, and safety, each of which is more or less\r\ndependent upon a proper circulation of the water. As for efficiency, we\r\nhave seen one proof in our kettle. When we provided means to preserve\r\nthe circulation, we found that we could carry a hotter fire and boil\r\naway the water much more rapidly than before. It is the same in a steam\r\nboiler. And we also noticed that when there was nothing but the\r\nunassisted circulation, the rising steam carried away so much water in\r\nthe form of foam that the kettle boiled over, but when the currents were\r\nseparated and an unimpeded circuit was established, this ceased, and a\r\nmuch larger supply of steam was delivered in a comparatively dry state.\r\nThus, circulation increases the efficiency in two ways: it adds to the\r\nability to take up the heat, and decreases the liability to waste that\r\nheat by what is technically known as priming. There is yet another way\r\nin which, incidentally, circulation increases efficiency of surface, and\r\nthat is by preventing in a greater or less degree the formation of\r\ndeposits thereon. Most waters contain some impurity which, when the\r\nwater is evaporated, remains to incrust the surface of the vessel. This\r\nincrustation becomes very serious sometimes, so much so as to almost\r\nentirely prevent the transmission of heat from the metal to the water.\r\nIt is said that an incrustation of only one-eighth inch will cause a\r\nloss of 25 per cent in efficiency, and this is probably within the truth\r\nin many cases. Circulation of water will not prevent incrustation\r\naltogether, but it lessens the amount in all waters, and almost entirely\r\nso in some, thus adding greatly to the efficiency of the surface.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3]\r\n\r\nA second advantage to be obtained through circulation is durability of\r\nthe boiler. This it secures mainly by keeping all parts at a nearly\r\nuniform temperature. The way to secure the greatest freedom from unequal\r\nstrains in a boiler is to provide for such a circulation of the water as\r\nwill insure the same temperature in all parts.\r\n\r\n3rd. Safety follows in the wake of durability, because a boiler which is\r\nnot subject to unequal strains of expansion and contraction is not only\r\nless liable to ordinary repairs, but also to rupture and disastrous\r\nexplosion. By far the most prolific cause of explosions is this same\r\nstrain from unequal expansions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 386 Horse-power Installation of Babcock & Wilcox Boilers\r\nat B. F. Keith's Theatre, Boston, Mass.]\r\n\r\nHaving thus briefly looked at the advantages of circulation of water in\r\nsteam boilers, let us see what are the best means of securing it under\r\nthe most efficient conditions We have seen in our kettle that one\r\nessential point was that the currents should be kept from interfering\r\nwith each other. If we could look into an ordinary return tubular boiler\r\nwhen steaming, we should see a curious commotion of currents rushing\r\nhither and thither, and shifting continually as one or the other\r\ncontending force gained a momentary mastery. The principal upward\r\ncurrents would be found at the two ends, one over the fire and the other\r\nover the first foot or so of the tubes. Between these, the downward\r\ncurrents struggle against the rising currents of steam and water. At a\r\nsudden demand for steam, or on the lifting of the safety valve, the\r\npressure being slightly reduced, the water jumps up in jets at every\r\nportion of the surface, being lifted by the sudden generation of steam\r\nthroughout the body of water. You have seen the effect of this sudden\r\ngeneration of steam in the well-known experiment with a Florence flask,\r\nto which a cold application is made while boiling water under pressure\r\nis within. You have also witnessed the geyser-like action when water is\r\nboiled in a test tube held vertically over a lamp (Fig. 3).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 5]\r\n\r\nIf now we take a U-tube depending from a vessel of water (Fig. 4) and\r\napply the lamp to one leg a circulation is at once set up within it, and\r\nno such spasmodic action can be produced. Thus U-tube is the\r\nrepresentative of the true method of circulation within a water-tube\r\nboiler properly constructed. We can, for the purpose of securing more\r\nheating surface, extend the heated leg into a long incline (Fig. 5),\r\nwhen we have the well-known inclined-tube generator. Now, by adding\r\nother tubes, we may further increase the heating surface (Fig. 6), while\r\nit will still be the U-tube in effect and action. In such a construction\r\nthe circulation is a function of the difference in density of the two\r\ncolumns. Its velocity is measured by the well-known Torricellian\r\nformula, V = (2gh)^{½}, or, approximately V = 8(h)^{½}, h being measured\r\nin terms of the lighter fluid. This velocity will increase until the\r\nrising column becomes all steam, but the quantity or weight circulated\r\nwill attain a maximum when the density of the mingled steam and water in\r\nthe rising column becomes one-half that of the solid water in the\r\ndescending column which is nearly coincident with the condition of half\r\nsteam and half water, the weight of the steam being very slight compared\r\nto that of the water.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 6]\r\n\r\nIt becomes easy by this rule to determine the circulation in any given\r\nboiler built on this principle, provided the construction is such as to\r\npermit a free flow of the water. Of course, every bend detracts a little\r\nand something is lost in getting up the velocity, but when the boiler is\r\nwell arranged and proportioned these retardations are slight.\r\n\r\nLet us take for example one of the 240 horse-power Babcock & Wilcox\r\nboilers here in the University. The height of the columns may be taken\r\nas 4½ feet, measuring from the surface of the water to about the center\r\nof the bundle of tubes over the fire, and the head would be equal to\r\nthis height at the maximum of circulation. We should, therefore, have a\r\nvelocity of 8(4½)^{½} = 16.97, say 17 feet per second. There are in this\r\nboiler fourteen sections, each having a 4-inch tube opening into the\r\ndrum, the area of which (inside) is 11 square inches, the fourteen\r\naggregating 154 square inches, or 1.07 square feet. This multiplied by\r\nthe velocity, 16.97 feet, gives 18.16 cubic feet mingled steam and water\r\ndischarged per second, one-half of which, or 9.08 cubic feet, is steam.\r\nAssuming this steam to be at 100 pounds gauge pressure, it will weigh\r\n0.258 pound per cubic foot. Hence, 2.34 pounds of steam will be\r\ndischarged per second, and 8,433 pounds per hour. Dividing this by 30,\r\nthe number of pounds representing a boiler horse power, we get 281.1\r\nhorse power, about 17 per cent, in excess of the rated power of the\r\nboiler. The water at the temperature of steam at 100 pounds pressure\r\nweighs 56 pounds per cubic foot, and the steam 0.258 pound, so that the\r\nsteam forms but 1/218 part of the mixture by weight, and consequently\r\neach particle of water will make 218 circuits before being evaporated\r\nwhen working at this capacity, and circulating the maximum weight of\r\nwater through the tubes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Portion of 9600 Horse-power Installation of Babcock &\r\nWilcox Boilers and Superheaters Being Erected at the South Boston,\r\nMass., Station of the Boston Elevated Railway Co. This Company Operates\r\nin its Various Stations a Total of 46,400 Horse Power of Babcock &\r\nWilcox Boilers]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 7]\r\n\r\nIt is evident that at the highest possible velocity of exit from the\r\ngenerating tubes, nothing but steam will be delivered and there will be\r\nno circulation of water except to supply the place of that evaporated.\r\nLet us see at what rate of steaming this would occur with the boiler\r\nunder consideration. We shall have a column of steam, say 4 feet high on\r\none side and an equal column of water on the other. Assuming, as before,\r\nthe steam at 100 pounds and the water at same temperature, we will have\r\na head of 866 feet of steam and an issuing velocity of 235.5 feet per\r\nsecond. This multiplied by 1.07 square feet of opening by 3,600 seconds\r\nin an hour, and by 0.258 gives 234,043 pounds of steam, which, though\r\nonly one-eighth the weight of mingled steam and water delivered at the\r\nmaximum, gives us 7,801 horse power, or 32 times the rated power of the\r\nboiler. Of course, this is far beyond any possibility of attainment, so\r\nthat it may be set down as certain that this boiler cannot be forced to\r\na point where there will not be an efficient circulation of the water.\r\nBy the same method of calculation it may be shown that when forced to\r\ndouble its rated power, a point rarely expected to be reached in\r\npractice, about two-thirds the volume of mixture of steam and water\r\ndelivered into the drum will be steam, and that the water will make 110\r\ncircuits while being evaporated. Also that when worked at only about\r\none-quarter its rated capacity, one-fifth of the volume will be steam\r\nand the water will make the rounds 870 times before it becomes steam.\r\nYou will thus see that in the proportions adopted in this boiler there\r\nis provision for perfect circulation under all the possible conditions\r\nof practice.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 8 [Developed to show Circulation]]\r\n\r\nIn designing boilers of this style it is necessary to guard against\r\nhaving the uptake at the upper end of the tubes too large, for if\r\nsufficiently large to allow downward currents therein, the whole effect\r\nof the rising column in increasing the circulation in the tubes is\r\nnullified (Fig. 7). This will readily be seen if we consider the uptake\r\nvery large when the only head producing circulation in the tubes will be\r\nthat due to the inclination of each tube taken by itself. This objection\r\nis only overcome when the uptake is so small as to be entirely filled\r\nwith the ascending current of mingled steam and water. It is also\r\nnecessary that this uptake should be practically direct, and it should\r\nnot be composed of frequent enlargements and contractions. Take, for\r\ninstance, a boiler well known in Europe, copied and sold here under\r\nanother name. It is made up of inclined tubes secured by pairs into\r\nboxes at the ends, which boxes are made to communicate with each other\r\nby return bends opposite the ends of the tubes. These boxes and return\r\nbends form an irregular uptake, whereby the steam is expected to rise to\r\na reservoir above. You will notice (Fig. 8) that the upward current of\r\nsteam and water in the return bend meets and directly antagonizes the\r\nupward current in the adjoining tube. Only one result can follow. If\r\ntheir velocities are equal, the momentum of both will be neutralized and\r\nall circulation stopped, or, if one be stronger, it will cause a back\r\nflow in the other by the amount of difference in force, with practically\r\nthe same result.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 4880 Horse-power Installation of Babcock & Wilcox Boilers\r\nat the Open Hearth Plant of the Cambria Steel Co., Johnstown, Pa. This\r\nCompany Operates a Total of 52,000 Horse Power of Babcock & Wilcox\r\nBoilers]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 9]\r\n\r\nIn a well-known boiler, many of which were sold, but of which none are\r\nnow made and a very few are still in use, the inventor claimed that the\r\nreturn bends and small openings against the tubes were for the purpose\r\nof \"restricting the circulation\" and no doubt they performed well that\r\noffice; but excepting for the smallness of the openings they were not as\r\nefficient for that purpose as the arrangement shown in Fig. 8.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 10]\r\n\r\nAnother form of boiler, first invented by Clarke or Crawford, and lately\r\nrevived, has the uptake made of boxes into which a number, generally\r\nfrom two to four tubes, are expanded, the boxes being connected together\r\nby nipples (Fig. 9). It is a well-known fact that where a fluid flows\r\nthrough a conduit which enlarges and then contracts, the velocity is\r\nlost to a greater or less extent at the enlargements, and has to be\r\ngotten up again at the contractions each time, with a corresponding loss\r\nof head. The same thing occurs in the construction shown in Fig. 9. The\r\nenlargements and contractions quite destroy the head and practically\r\novercome the tendency of the water to circulate.\r\n\r\nA horizontal tube stopped at one end, as shown in Fig. 10, can have no\r\nproper circulation within it. If moderately driven, the water may\r\nstruggle in against the issuing steam sufficiently to keep the surface\r\ncovered, but a slight degree of forcing will cause it to act like the\r\ntest tube in Fig. 3, and the more there are of them in a given boiler\r\nthe more spasmodic will be its working.\r\n\r\nThe experiment with our kettle (Fig. 2) gives the clue to the best means\r\nof promoting circulation in ordinary shell boilers. Steenstrup or\r\n\"Martin\" and \"Galloway\" water tubes placed in such boilers also assist\r\nin directing the circulation therein, but it is almost impossible to\r\nproduce in shell boilers, by any means the circulation of all the water\r\nin one continuous round, such as marks the well-constructed water-tube\r\nboiler.\r\n\r\nAs I have before remarked, provision for a proper circulation of water\r\nhas been almost universally ignored in designing steam boilers,\r\nsometimes to the great damage of the owner, but oftener to the jeopardy\r\nof the lives of those who are employed to run them. The noted case of\r\nthe Montana and her sister ship, where some $300,000 was thrown away in\r\ntrying an experiment which a proper consideration of this subject would\r\nhave avoided, is a case in point; but who shall count the cost of life\r\nand treasure not, perhaps, directly traceable to, but, nevertheless, due\r\nentirely to such neglect in design and construction of the thousands of\r\nboilers in which this necessary element has been ignored?\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the light of the performance of the exacting conditions of present\r\nday power-plant practice, a review of this lecture and of the foregoing\r\nlist of requirements reveals the insight of the inventors of the Babcock\r\n& Wilcox boiler into the fundamental principles of steam generator\r\ndesign and construction.\r\n\r\nSince the Babcock & Wilcox boiler became thoroughly established as a\r\ndurable and efficient steam generator, many types of water-tube boilers\r\nhave appeared on the market. Most of them, failing to meet enough of the\r\nrequirements of a perfect boiler, have fallen by the wayside, while a\r\nfew failing to meet all of the requirements, have only a limited field\r\nof usefulness. None have been superior, and in the most cases the most\r\nardent admirers of other boilers have been satisfied in looking up to\r\nthe Babcock & Wilcox boiler as a standard and in claiming that the newer\r\nboilers were \"just as good.\"\r\n\r\nRecords of recent performances under the most severe conditions of\r\nservices on land and sea, show that the Babcock & Wilcox boiler can be\r\nrun continually and regularly at higher overloads, with higher\r\nefficiency, and lower upkeep cost than any other boiler on the market.\r\nIt is especially adapted for power-plant work where it is necessary to\r\nuse a boiler in which steam can be raised quickly and the boiler placed\r\non the line either from a cold state or from a banked fire in the\r\nshortest possible time, and with which the capacity, with clean feed\r\nwater, will be largely limited by the amount of coal that can be burned\r\nin the furnace.\r\n\r\nThe distribution of the circulation through the separate headers and\r\nsections and the action of the headers in forcing a maximum and\r\ncontinuous circulation in the lower tubes, permit the operation of the\r\nBabcock & Wilcox boiler without objectionable priming, with a higher\r\ndegree of concentration of salts in the water than is possible in any\r\nother type of boiler.\r\n\r\nRepeated daily performances at overloads have demonstrated beyond a\r\ndoubt the correctness of Mr. Babcock's computation regarding the\r\ncirculating tube and header area required for most efficient\r\ncirculation. They also have proved that enlargement of the area of\r\nheaders and circulating tubes beyond a certain point diminishes the head\r\navailable for causing circulation and consequently limits the ability of\r\nthe boiler to respond to demands for overloads.\r\n\r\nIn this lecture Mr. Babcock made the prediction that with the\r\ncirculating tube area proportioned in accordance with the principles\r\nlaid down, the Babcock & Wilcox boiler could be continuously run at\r\ndouble its nominal rating, which at that time was based on 12 square\r\nfeet of heating surface per horse power. This prediction is being\r\nfulfilled daily in all the large and prominent power plants in this\r\ncountry and abroad, and it has been repeatedly demonstrated that with\r\nclean water and clean tube surfaces it is possible to safely operate at\r\nover 300 per cent of the nominal rating.\r\n\r\nIn the development of electrical power stations it becomes more and more\r\napparent that it is economical to run a boiler at high ratings during\r\nthe times of peak loads, as by so doing the lay-over losses are\r\ndiminished and the economy of the plant as a whole is increased.\r\n\r\nThe number and importance of the large electric lighting and power\r\nstations constructed during the last ten years that are equipped with\r\nBabcock & Wilcox boilers, is a most gratifying demonstration of the\r\nmerit of the apparatus, especially in view of their satisfactory\r\noperation under conditions which are perhaps more exacting than those of\r\nany other service.\r\n\r\nTime, the test of all, results with boilers as with other things, in the\r\nsurvival of the fittest. When judged on this basis the Babcock & Wilcox\r\nboiler stands pre-eminent in its ability to cover the whole field of\r\nsteam generation with the highest commercial efficiency obtainable. Year\r\nafter year the Babcock & Wilcox boiler has become more firmly\r\nestablished as the standard of excellence in the boiler making art.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: South Boston Station of the Boston Elevated Ry.

Where a device has been once fairly tried and found to be\r\nimperfect or impracticable, the knowledge of that trial is of advantage\r\nin further investigation. Regardless of the lesson taught by failure,\r\nhowever, it is an almost every-day occurrence that some device or\r\nconstruction which has been tried and found wanting, if not worthless,\r\nis again introduced as a great improvement upon a device which has shown\r\nby its survival to be the fittest.\r\n\r\nThe success of the Babcock & Wilcox boiler is due to many years of\r\nconstant adherence to one line of research, in which an endeavor has\r\nbeen made to introduce improvements with the view to producing a boiler\r\nwhich would most effectively meet the demands of the times. During the\r\nperiods that this boiler has been built, other companies have placed on\r\nthe market more than thirty water-tube or sectional water-tube boilers,\r\nmost of which, though they may have attained some distinction and sale,\r\nhave now entirely disappeared. The following incomplete list will serve\r\nto recall the names of some of the boilers that have had a vogue at\r\nvarious times, but which are now practically unknown: Dimpfel, Howard,\r\nGriffith & Wundrum, Dinsmore, Miller \"Fire Box\", Miller \"American\",\r\nMiller \"Internal Tube\", Miller \"Inclined Tube\", Phleger, Weigant, the\r\nLady Verner, the Allen, the Kelly, the Anderson, the Rogers & Black, the\r\nEclipse or Kilgore, the Moore, the Baker & Smith, the Renshaw, the\r\nShackleton, the \"Duplex\", the Pond & Bradford, the Whittingham, the\r\nBee, the Hazleton or \"Common Sense\", the Reynolds, the Suplee or Luder,\r\nthe Babbit, the Reed, the Smith, the Standard, etc., etc.\r\n\r\nIt is with the object of protecting our customers and friends from loss\r\nthrough purchasing discarded ideas that there is given on the following\r\npages a brief history of the development of the Babcock & Wilcox boiler\r\nas it is built to-day. The illustrations and brief descriptions indicate\r\nclearly the various designs and constructions that have been used and\r\nthat have been replaced, as experience has shown in what way improvement\r\nmight be made. They serve as a history of the experimental steps in the\r\ndevelopment of the present Babcock & Wilcox boiler, the value and\r\nsuccess of which, as a steam generator, is evidenced by the fact that\r\nthe largest and most discriminating users continue to purchase them\r\nafter years of experience in their operation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: No. 1]\r\n\r\nNo. 1. The original Babcock & Wilcox boiler was patented in 1867. The\r\nmain idea in its design was safety, to which all other features were\r\nsacrificed wherever they conflicted. The boiler consisted of a nest of\r\nhorizontal tubes, serving as a steam and water reservoir, placed above\r\nand connected at each end by bolted joints to a second nest of inclined\r\nheating tubes filled with water. The tubes were placed one above the\r\nother in vertical rows, each row and its connecting end forming a single\r\ncasting. Hand-holes were placed at each end for cleaning. Internal tubes\r\nwere placed within the inclined tubes with a view to aiding circulation.\r\n\r\nNo. 2. This boiler was the same as No. 1, except that the internal\r\ncirculating tubes were omitted as they were found to hinder rather than\r\nhelp the circulation.\r\n\r\nNos. 1 and 2 were found to be faulty in both material and design, cast\r\nmetal proving unfit for heating surfaces placed directly over the fire,\r\nas it cracked as soon as any scale formed.\r\n\r\nNo. 3. Wrought-iron tubes were substituted for the cast-iron heating\r\ntubes, the ends being brightened, laid in moulds, and the headers cast\r\non.\r\n\r\nThe steam and water capacity in this design were insufficient to secure\r\nregularity of action, there being no reserve upon which to draw during\r\nfiring or when the water was fed intermittently. The attempt to dry the\r\nsteam by superheating it in the nest of tubes forming the steam space\r\nwas found to be impracticable. The steam delivered was either wet, dry\r\nor superheated, according to the rate at which it was being drawn from\r\nthe boiler. Sediment was found to lodge in the lowermost point of the\r\nboiler at the rear end and the exposed portions cracked off at this\r\npoint when subjected to the furnace heat.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: No. 4]\r\n\r\nNo. 4. A plain cylinder, carrying the water line at its center and\r\nleaving the upper half for steam space, was substituted for the nest of\r\ntubes forming the steam and water space in Nos. 1, 2 and 3. The sections\r\nwere made as in No. 3 and a mud drum added to the rear end of the\r\nsections at the point that was lowest and farthest removed from the\r\nfire. The gases were made to pass off at one side and did not come into\r\ncontact with the mud drum. Dry steam was obtained through the increase\r\nof separating surface and steam space and the added water capacity\r\nfurnished a storage for heat to tide over irregularities of firing and\r\nfeeding. By the addition of the drum, the boiler became a serviceable\r\nand practical design, retaining all of the features of safety. As the\r\ndrum was removed from the direct action of the fire, it was not\r\nsubjected to excessive strain due to unequal expansion, and its\r\ndiameter, if large in comparison with that of the tubes formerly used,\r\nwas small when compared with that of cylindrical boilers. Difficulties\r\nwere encountered in this boiler in securing reliable joints between the\r\nwrought-iron tubes and the cast-iron headers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: No. 5]\r\n\r\nNo. 5. In this design, wrought-iron water legs were substituted for the\r\ncast-iron headers, the tubes being expanded into the inside sheets and a\r\nlarge cover placed opposite the front end of the tubes for cleaning. The\r\ntubes were staggered one above the other, an arrangement found to be\r\nmore efficient in the absorption of heat than where they were placed in\r\nvertical rows. In other respects, the boiler was similar to No. 4,\r\nexcept that it had lost the important element of safety through the\r\nintroduction of the very objectionable feature of flat stayed surfaces.\r\nThe large doors for access to the tubes were also a cause of weakness.\r\n\r\nAn installation of these boilers was made at the plant of the Calvert\r\nSugar Refinery in Baltimore, and while they were satisfactory in their\r\noperation, were never duplicated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: No. 6]\r\n\r\nNo. 6. This was a modification of No. 5 in which longer tubes were used\r\nand over which the gases were caused to make three passes with a view of\r\nbetter economy. In addition, some of the stayed surfaces were omitted\r\nand handholes substituted for the large access doors. A number of\r\nboilers of this design were built but their excessive first cost, the\r\nlack of adjustability of the structure under varying temperatures, and\r\nthe inconvenience of transportation, led to No. 7.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: No. 7]\r\n\r\nNo. 7. In this boiler, the headers and water legs were replaced by\r\nT-heads screwed to the ends of the inclined tubes. The faces of these Ts\r\nwere milled and the tubes placed one above the other with the milled\r\nfaces metal to metal. Long bolts passed through each vertical section of\r\nthe T-heads and through connecting boxes on the heads of the drums\r\nholding the whole together. A large number of boilers of this design\r\nwere built and many were in successful operation for over twenty years.\r\nIn most instances, however, they were altered to later types.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: No. 8]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: No. 9]\r\n\r\nNos. 8 and 9. These boilers were known as the Griffith & Wundrum type,\r\nthe concern which built them being later merged in The Babcock & Wilcox\r\nCo. Experiments were made with this design with four passages of the\r\ngases across the tubes and the downward circulation of the water at the\r\nrear of the boiler was carried to the bottom row of tubes. In No. 9 an\r\nattempt was made to increase the safety and reduce the cost by reducing\r\nthe amount of steam and water capacity. A drum at right angles to the\r\nline of tubes was used but as there was no provision made to secure dry\r\nsteam, the results were not satisfactory. The next move in the direction\r\nof safety was the employment of several drums of small diameter instead\r\nof a single drum.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: No. 10]\r\n\r\nThis is shown in No. 10. A nest of small horizontal drums, 15 inches in\r\ndiameter, was used in place of the single drum of larger diameter. A set\r\nof circulation tubes was placed at an intermediate angle between the\r\nmain bank of heating tubes and the horizontal drums forming the steam\r\nreservoir. These circulators were to return to the rear end of the\r\ncirculating tubes the water carried up by the circulation, and in this\r\nway were to allow only steam to be delivered to the small drums above.\r\nThere was no improvement in the action of this boiler over that of No.\r\n9.\r\n\r\nThe four passages of the gas over the tubes tried in Nos. 8, 9 and 10\r\nwere not found to add to the economy of the boiler.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: No. 11]\r\n\r\nNo. 11. A trial was next made of a box coil system, in which the water\r\nwas made to transverse the furnace several times before being delivered\r\nto the drum above. The tendency here, as in all similar boilers, was to\r\nform steam in the middle of the coil and blow the water from each end,\r\nleaving the tubes practically dry until the steam found an outlet and\r\nthe water returned. This boiler had, in addition to a defective\r\ncirculation, a decidedly geyser-like action and produced wet steam.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: No. 12]\r\n\r\nAll of the types mentioned, with the exception of Nos. 5 and 6, had\r\nbetween their several parts a large number of bolted joints which were\r\nsubjected to the action of the fire. When these boilers were placed in\r\noperation it was demonstrated that as soon as any scale formed on the\r\nheating surfaces, leaks were caused due to unequal expansion.\r\n\r\nNo. 12. With this boiler, an attempt was made to remove the joints from\r\nthe fire and to increase the heating surface in a given space. Water\r\ntubes were expanded into both sides of wrought-iron boxes, openings\r\nbeing made for the admission of water and the exit of steam. Fire tubes\r\nwere placed inside the water tubes to increase the heating surface. This\r\ndesign was abandoned because of the rapid stopping up of the tubes by\r\nscale and the impossibility of cleaning them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: No. 13]\r\n\r\nNo. 13. Vertical straight line headers of cast iron, each containing two\r\nrows of tubes, were bolted to a connection leading to the steam and\r\nwater drum above.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: No. 14]\r\n\r\nNo. 14. A wrought-iron box was substituted for the double cast-iron\r\nheaders. In this design, stays were necessary and were found, as always,\r\nto be an element to be avoided wherever possible. The boiler was an\r\nimprovement on No. 6, however. A slanting bridge wall was introduced\r\nunderneath the drum to throw a larger portion of its heating surface\r\ninto the combustion chamber under the bank of tubes.\r\n\r\nThis bridge wall was found to be difficult to keep in repair and was of\r\nno particular benefit.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: No. 15]\r\n\r\nNo. 15. Each row of tubes was expanded at each end into a continuous\r\nheader, cast of car wheel metal. The headers had a sinuous form so that\r\nthey would lie close together and admit of a staggered position of the\r\ntubes when assembled. While other designs of header form were tried\r\nlater, experience with Nos. 14 and 15 showed that the style here adopted\r\nwas the best for all purposes and it has not been changed materially\r\nsince. The drum in this design was supported by girders resting on the\r\nbrickwork. Bolted joints were discarded, with the exception of those\r\nconnecting the headers to the front and rear ends of the drums and the\r\nbottom of the rear headers to the mud drum. Even such joints, however,\r\nwere found objectionable and were superseded in subsequent construction\r\nby short lengths of tubes expanded into bored holes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: No. 16]\r\n\r\nNo. 16. In this design, headers were tried which were made in the form\r\nof triangular boxes, in each of which there were three tubes expanded.\r\nThese boxes were alternately reversed and connected by short lengths of\r\nexpanded tubes, being connected to the drum by tubes bent in a manner to\r\nallow them to enter the shell normally. The joints between headers\r\nintroduced an element of weakness and the connections to the drum were\r\ninsufficient to give adequate circulation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: No. 17]\r\n\r\nNo. 17. Straight horizontal headers were next tried, alternately shifted\r\nright and left to allow a staggering of tubes. These headers were\r\nconnected to each other and to the drums by expanded nipples. The\r\nobjections to this boiler were almost the same as those to No. 16.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: No. 18]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: No. 19]\r\n\r\nNos. 18 and 19. These boilers were designed primarily for fire\r\nprotection purposes, the requirements demanding a small, compact boiler\r\nwith ability to raise steam quickly. These both served the purpose\r\nadmirably but, as in No. 9, the only provision made for the securing of\r\ndry steam was the use of the steam dome, shown in the illustration. This\r\ndome was found inadequate and has since been abandoned in nearly all\r\nforms of boiler construction. No other remedy being suggested at the\r\ntime, these boilers were not considered as desirable for general use as\r\nNos. 21 and 22. In Europe, however, where small size units were more in\r\ndemand, No. 18 was modified somewhat and used largely with excellent\r\nresults. These experiments, as they may now be called, although many\r\nboilers of some of the designs were built, clearly demonstrated that the\r\nbest construction and efficiency required adherence to the following\r\nelements of design:\r\n\r\n\r\n1st. Sinuous headers for each vertical row of tubes.\r\n\r\n\r\n2nd. A separate and independent connection with the drum, both front and\r\nrear, for each vertical row of tubes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: No. 20A]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: No. 20B]\r\n\r\n\r\n3rd. All joints between parts of the boiler proper to be made without\r\nbolts or screw plates.\r\n\r\n\r\n4th. No surfaces to be used which necessitate the use of stays.\r\n\r\n\r\n5th. The boiler supported independently of the brickwork so as to allow\r\nfreedom for expansion and contraction as it is heated or cooled.\r\n\r\n\r\n6th. Ample diameter of steam and water drums, these not to be less than\r\n30 inches except for small size units.\r\n\r\n\r\n7th. Every part accessible for cleaning and repairs.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith these points having been determined, No. 20 was designed. This\r\nboiler had all the desirable features just enumerated, together with a\r\nnumber of improvements as to detail of construction. The general form of\r\nNo. 15 was adhered to but the bolted connections between sections and\r\ndrum and sections and mud drum were discarded in favor of connections\r\nmade by short lengths of boiler tubes expanded into the adjacent parts.\r\nThis boiler was suspended from girders, like No. 15, but these in turn\r\nwere carried on vertical supports, leaving the pressure parts entirely\r\nfree from the brickwork, the mutually deteriorating strains present\r\nwhere one was supported by the other being in this way overcome.\r\nHundreds of thousands of horse power of this design were built, giving\r\ngreat satisfaction. The boiler was known as the \"C. I. F.\" (cast-iron\r\nfront) style, an ornamental cast-iron front having been usually\r\nfurnished.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: No. 21]\r\n\r\nThe next step, and the one which connects the boilers as described above\r\nto the boiler as it is built to-day, was the design illustrated in No.\r\n21. These boilers were known as the \"W. I. F.\" style, the fronts\r\nfurnished as part of the equipment being constructed largely of wrought\r\niron. The cast-iron drumheads used in No. 20 were replaced by\r\nwrought-steel flanged and \"bumped\" heads. The drums were made longer and\r\nthe sections connected to wrought-steel cross boxes riveted to the\r\nbottom of the drums. The boilers were supported by girders and columns\r\nas in No. 20.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: No. 22]\r\n\r\nNo. 22. This boiler, which is designated as the \"Vertical Header\" type,\r\nhas the same general features of construction as No. 21, except that the\r\ntube sheet side of the headers is \"stepped\" to allow the headers to be\r\nplaced vertically and at right angles to the drum and still maintain the\r\ntubes at the angle used in Nos. 20 and 21.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: No. 23]\r\n\r\nNo. 23, or the cross drum design of boiler, is a development of the\r\nBabcock & Wilcox marine boiler, in which the cross drum is used\r\nexclusively. The experience of the Glasgow Works of The Babcock &\r\nWilcox, Ltd., with No. 18 proved that proper attention to details of\r\nconstruction would make it a most desirable form of boiler where\r\nheadroom was limited. A large number of this design have been\r\nsuccessfully installed and are giving satisfactory results under widely\r\nvarying conditions. The cross drum boiler is also built in a vertical\r\nheader design.\r\n\r\nBoilers Nos. 21, 22 and 23, with a few modifications, are now the\r\nstandard forms. These designs are illustrated, as they are constructed\r\nto-day, on pages 48, 52, 54, 58 and 60.\r\n\r\nThe last step in the development of the water-tube boiler, beyond which\r\nit seems almost impossible for science and skill to advance, consists in\r\nthe making of all pressure parts of the boiler of wrought steel,\r\nincluding sinuous headers, cross boxes, nozzles, and the like. This\r\nconstruction was the result of the demands of certain Continental laws\r\nthat are coming into general vogue in this country. The Babcock & Wilcox\r\nCo. have at the present time a plant producing steel forgings that have\r\nbeen pronounced by the _London Engineer_ to be \"a perfect triumph\r\nof the forgers' art\".\r\n\r\nThe various designs of this all wrought-steel boiler are fully\r\nillustrated in the following pages.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Wrought-steel Vertical Header Longitudinal Drum Babcock &\r\nWilcox Boiler, Equipped with Babcock & Wilcox Superheater and Babcock &\r\nWilcox Chain Grate Stoker]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BABCOCK & WILCOX BOILER\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following brief description of the Babcock & Wilcox boiler will\r\nclearly indicate the manner in which it fulfills the requirements of the\r\nperfect steam boiler already enumerated.\r\n\r\nThe Babcock & Wilcox boiler is built in two general classes, the\r\nlongitudinal drum type and the cross drum type. Either of these designs\r\nmay be constructed with vertical or inclined headers, and the headers in\r\nturn may be of wrought steel or cast iron dependent upon the working\r\npressure for which the boiler is constructed. The headers may be of\r\ndifferent lengths, that is, may connect different numbers of tubes, and\r\nit is by a change in the number of tubes in height per section and the\r\nnumber of sections in width that the size of the boiler is varied.\r\n\r\nThe longitudinal drum boiler is the generally accepted standard of\r\nBabcock & Wilcox construction. The cross drum boiler, though originally\r\ndesigned to meet certain conditions of headroom, has become popular for\r\nnumerous classes of work where low headroom is not a requirement which\r\nmust be met.\r\n\r\nLONGITUDINAL DRUM CONSTRUCTION--The heating surface of this type of\r\nboiler is made up of a drum or drums, depending upon the width of the\r\nboiler extending longitudinally over the other pressure parts. To the\r\ndrum or drums there are connected through cross boxes at either end the\r\nsections, which are made up of headers and tubes. At the lower end of\r\nthe sections there is a mud drum extending entirely across the setting\r\nand connected to all sections. The connections between all parts are by\r\nshort lengths of tubes expanded into bored seats.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Forged-steel Drumhead with Manhole Plate in Position]\r\n\r\nThe drums are of three sheets, of such thickness as to give the required\r\nfactor of safety under the maximum pressure for which the boiler is\r\nconstructed. The circular seams are ordinarily single lap riveted though\r\nthese may be double lap riveted to meet certain requirements of pressure\r\nor of specifications. The longitudinal seams are properly proportioned\r\nbutt and strap or lap riveted joints dependent upon the pressure for\r\nwhich the boilers are built. Where butt strap joints are used the straps\r\nare bent to the proper radius in an hydraulic press. The courses are\r\nbuilt independently to template and are assembled by an hydraulic\r\nforcing press. All riveted holes are punched one-quarter inch smaller\r\nthan the size of rivets as driven and are reamed to full size after the\r\nplates are assembled. All rivets are driven by hydraulic pressure and\r\nheld until black.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Forged-steel Drumhead Interior]\r\n\r\nThe drumheads are hydraulic forged at a single heat, the manhole opening\r\nand stiffening ring being forged in position. Flat raised seats for\r\nwater column and feed connections are formed in the forging.\r\n\r\nAll heads are provided with manholes, the edges of which are turned\r\ntrue. The manhole plates are of forged steel and turned to fit manhole\r\nopening. These plates are held in position by forged-steel guards and\r\nbolts.\r\n\r\nThe drum nozzles are of forged steel, faced, and fitted with taper\r\nthread stud bolts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Forged-steel Drum Nozzle]\r\n\r\nCross boxes by means of which the sections are attached to the drums,\r\nare of forged steel, made from a single sheet.\r\n\r\nWhere two or more drums are used in one boiler they are connected by a\r\ncross pipe having a flanged outlet for the steam connection.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Forged-steel Cross Box]\r\n\r\nThe sections are built of 4-inch hot finished seamless open-hearth steel\r\ntubes of No. 10 B. W. G. where the boilers are built for working\r\npressures up to 210 pounds. Where the working pressure is to be above\r\nthis and below 260 pounds, No. 9 B. W. G. tubes are supplied.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Inside Handhole Fittings Wrought-steel Vertical Header]\r\n\r\nThe tubes are expanded into headers of serpentine or sinuous form, which\r\ndispose the tubes in a staggered position when assembled as a complete\r\nboiler. These headers are of wrought steel or of cast iron, the latter\r\nbeing ordinarily supplied where the working pressure is not to exceed\r\n160 pounds. The headers may be either vertical or inclined as shown in\r\nthe various illustrations of assembled boilers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Wrought-steel Vertical Header]\r\n\r\nOpposite each tube end in the headers there is placed a handhole of\r\nsufficient size to permit the cleaning, removal or renewal of a tube.\r\nThese openings in the wrought steel vertical headers are elliptical in\r\nshape, machine faced, and milled to a true plane back from the edge a\r\nsufficient distance to make a seat. The openings are closed by inside\r\nfitting forged plates, shouldered to center in the opening, their\r\nflanged seats milled to a true plane. These plates are held in position\r\nby studs and forged-steel binders and nuts. The joints between plates\r\nand headers are made with a thin gasket.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Inside Handhole Fitting Wrought-steel Inclined Header]\r\n\r\nIn the wrought-steel inclined headers the handhole openings are either\r\ncircular or elliptical, the former being ordinarily supplied. The\r\ncircular openings have a raised seat milled to a true plane. The\r\nopenings are closed on the outside by forged-steel caps, milled and\r\nground true, held in position by forged-steel safety clamps and secured\r\nby ball-headed bolts to assure correct alignment. With this style of\r\nfitting, joints are made tight, metal to metal, without packing of any\r\nkind.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Wrought-steel Inclined Header]\r\n\r\nWhere elliptical handholes are furnished they are faced inside, closed\r\nby inside fitting forged-steel plates, held to their seats by studs and\r\nsecured by forged-steel binders and nuts.\r\n\r\nThe joints between plates and header are made with a thin gasket.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Cast-iron Vertical Header]\r\n\r\nThe vertical cast-iron headers have elliptical handholes with raised\r\nseats milled to a true plane. These are closed on the outside by\r\ncast-iron caps milled true, held in position by forged-steel safety\r\nclamps, which close the openings from the inside and which are secured\r\nby ball-headed bolts to assure proper alignment. All joints are made\r\ntight, metal to metal, without packing of any kind.\r\n\r\nThe mud drum to which the sections are attached at the lower end of the\r\nrear headers, is a forged-steel box 7¼ inches square, and of such length\r\nas to be connected to all headers by means of wrought nipples expanded\r\ninto counterbored seats. The mud drum is furnished with handholes for\r\ncleaning, these being closed from the inside by forged-steel plates with\r\nstuds, and secured on a faced seat in the mud drum by forged-steel\r\nbinders and nuts. The joints between the plates and the drum are made\r\nwith thin gaskets. The mud drum is tapped for blow-off connection.\r\n\r\nAll connections between drums and sections and between sections and mud\r\ndrum are of hot finished seamless open-hearth steel tubes of No. 9\r\nB. W. G.\r\n\r\nBoilers of the longitudinal drum type are suspended front and rear from\r\nwrought-steel supporting frames entirely independent of the brickwork.\r\nThis allows for expansion and contraction of the pressure parts without\r\nstraining either the boiler or the brickwork, and also allows of\r\nbrickwork repair or renewal without in any way disturbing the boiler or\r\nits connections.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Babcock & Wilcox Wrought-steel Vertical Header Cross Drum\r\nBoiler]\r\n\r\nCROSS DRUM CONSTRUCTION--The cross drum type of boilers differs from the\r\nlongitudinal only in drum construction and method of support. The drum\r\nin this type is placed transversely across the rear of the boiler and is\r\nconnected to the sections by means of circulating tubes expanded into\r\nbored seats.\r\n\r\nThe drums for all pressures are of two sheets of sufficient thickness to\r\ngive the required factor of safety. The longitudinal seams are double\r\nriveted butt strapped, the straps being bent to the proper radius in an\r\nhydraulic press. The circulating tubes are expanded into the drums at\r\nthe seams, the butt straps serving as tube seats.\r\n\r\nThe drumheads, drum fittings and features of riveting are the same in\r\nthe cross drum as in the longitudinal types. The sections and mud drum\r\nare also the same for the two types.\r\n\r\nCross drum boilers are supported at the rear on the mud drum which rests\r\non cast-iron foundation plates. They are suspended at the front from a\r\nwrought-iron supporting frame, each section being suspended\r\nindependently from the cross members by hook suspension bolts. This\r\nmethod of support is such as to allow for expansion and contraction\r\nwithout straining either the boiler or the brickwork and permits of\r\nrepair or renewal of the latter without in any way disturbing the boiler\r\nor its connections.\r\n\r\nThe following features of design and of attachments supplied are the\r\nsame for all types.\r\n\r\nFRONTS--Ornamental fronts are fitted to the front supporting frame.\r\nThese have large doors for access to the front headers and panels above\r\nthe fire fronts. The fire fronts where furnished have independent frames\r\nfor fire doors which are bolted on, and ashpit doors fitted with blast\r\ncatches. The lugs on door frames and on doors are cast solid. The faces\r\nof doors and of frames are planed and the lugs milled. The doors and\r\nframes are placed in their final relative position, clamped, and the\r\nholes for hinge pins drilled while thus held. A perfect alignment of\r\ndoor and frame is thus assured and the method is representative of the\r\ncare taken in small details of manufacture.\r\n\r\nThe front as a whole is so arranged that any stoker may be applied with\r\nbut slight modification wherever boilers are set with sufficient furnace\r\nheight.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Cross Drum Boiler Front]\r\n\r\nIn the vertical header boilers large wrought-iron doors, which give\r\naccess to the rear headers, are attached to the rear supporting frame.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Wrought-steel Inclined Header Longitudinal Drum Babcock &\r\nWilcox Boiler, Equipped with Babcock & Wilcox Superheater]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Automatic Drumhead Stop and Check Valve]\r\n\r\nFITTINGS--Each boiler is provided with the following fittings as part of\r\nthe standard equipment:\r\n\r\nBlow-off connections and valves attached to the mud drum.\r\n\r\nSafety valves placed on nozzles on the steam drums.\r\n\r\nA water column connected to the front of the drum.\r\n\r\nA steam gauge attached to the boiler front.\r\n\r\nFeed water connection and valves. A flanged stop and check valve of\r\nheavy pattern is attached directly to each drumhead, closing\r\nautomatically in case of a rupture in the feed line.\r\n\r\nAll valves and fittings are substantially built and are of designs which\r\nby their successful service for many years have become standard with The\r\nBabcock & Wilcox Co.\r\n\r\nThe fixtures that are supplied with the boilers consist of:\r\n\r\nDead plates and supports, the plates arranged for a fire brick lining.\r\n\r\nA full set of grate bars and bearers, the latter fitted with expansion\r\nsockets for side walls.\r\n\r\nFlame bridge plates with necessary fastenings, and special fire brick\r\nfor lining same.\r\n\r\nBridge wall girder for hanging bridge wall with expansion sockets for\r\nside walls.\r\n\r\nA full set of access and cleaning doors through which all portions of\r\nthe pressure parts may be reached.\r\n\r\nA swing damper and frame with damper operating rig.\r\n\r\nThere are also supplied with each boiler a wrench for handhole nuts, a\r\nwater-driven turbine tube cleaner, a set of fire tools and a metal steam\r\nhose and cleaning pipe equipped with a special nozzle for blowing dust\r\nand soot from the tubes.\r\n\r\nAside from the details of design and construction as covered in the\r\nforegoing description, a study of the illustrations will make clear the\r\nfeatures of the boiler as a whole which have led to its success.\r\n\r\nThe method of supporting the boiler has been described. This allows it\r\nto be hung at any height that may be necessary to properly handle the\r\nfuel to be burned or to accommodate the stoker to be installed. The\r\nheight of the nest of tubes which forms the roof of the furnace is thus\r\nthe controlling feature in determining the furnace height, or the\r\ndistance from the front headers to the floor line. The sides and front\r\nof the furnace are formed by the side and front boiler walls. The rear\r\nwall of the furnace consists of a bridge wall built from the bottom of\r\nthe ashpit to the lower row of tubes. The location of this wall may be\r\nadjusted within limits to give the depth of furnace demanded by the fuel\r\nused. Ordinarily the bridge wall is the determining feature in the\r\nlocating of the front baffle. Where a great depth of furnace is\r\nnecessary, in which case, if the front baffle were placed at the bridge\r\nwall the front pass of the boiler would be relatively too long, a\r\npatented construction is used which maintains the baffle in what may be\r\nconsidered its normal position, and a connection made between the baffle\r\nand the bridge wall by means of a tile roof. Such furnace construction\r\nis known as a \"Webster\" furnace.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Longitudinal Drum Boiler--Front View]\r\n\r\nA consideration of this furnace will clearly indicate its adaptability,\r\nby reason of its flexibility, for any fuel and any design of stoker. The\r\nboiler lends itself readily to installation with an extension or Dutch\r\noven furnace if this be demanded by the fuel to be used, and in general\r\nit may be stated that a satisfactory furnace arrangement may be made in\r\nconnection with a Babcock & Wilcox boiler for burning any fuel, solid,\r\nliquid or gaseous.\r\n\r\nThe gases of combustion evolved in the furnace above described are led\r\nover the heating surfaces by two baffles. These are formed of cast-iron\r\nbaffle plates lined with special fire brick and held in position by tube\r\nclamps. The front baffle leads the gases through the forward portion of\r\nthe tubes to a chamber beneath the drum or drums. It is in this chamber\r\nthat a superheater is installed where such an apparatus is desired. The\r\ngases make a turn over the front baffle, are led downward through the\r\ncentral portion of the tubes, called the second pass, by means of a\r\nhanging bridge wall of brick and the second baffle, around which they\r\nmake a second turn upward, pass through the rear portion of the tubes\r\nand are led to the stack or flue through a damper box in the rear wall,\r\nor around the drums to a damper box placed overhead.\r\n\r\nThe space beneath the tubes between the bridge wall and the rear boiler\r\nwall forms a pocket into which much of the soot from the gases in their\r\ndownward passage through the second pass will be deposited and from\r\nwhich it may be readily cleaned through doors furnished for the purpose.\r\n\r\nThe gas passages are ample and are so proportioned that the resistance\r\noffered to the gases is only such as will assure the proper abstraction\r\nof heat from the gases without causing undue friction, requiring\r\nexcessive draft.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Partial Vertical Section Showing Method of Introducing\r\nFeed Water]\r\n\r\nThe method in which the feed water is introduced through the front\r\ndrumhead of the boiler is clearly seen by reference to the illustration.\r\nFrom this point of introduction the water passes to the rear of the\r\ndrum, downward through the rear circulating tubes to the sections,\r\nupward through the tubes of the sections to the front headers and\r\nthrough these headers and front circulating tubes again to the drum\r\nwhere such water as has not been formed into steam retraces its course.\r\nThe steam formed in the passage through the tubes is liberated as the\r\nwater reaches the front of the drum. The steam so formed is stored in\r\nthe steam space above the water line, from which it is drawn through a\r\nso-called \"dry pipe.\" The dry pipe in the Babcock & Wilcox boiler is\r\nmisnamed, as in reality it fulfills none of the functions ordinarily\r\nattributed to such a device. This function is usually to restrict the\r\nflow of steam from a boiler with a view to avoid priming. In the Babcock\r\n& Wilcox boiler its function is simply that of a collecting pipe, and as\r\nthe aggregate area of the holes in it is greatly in excess of the area\r\nof the steam outlet from the drum, it is plain that there can be no\r\nrestriction through this collecting pipe. It extends nearly the length\r\nof the drum, and draws steam evenly from the whole length of the steam\r\nspace.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Cast-iron Vertical Header Longitudinal Drum Babcock &\r\nWilcox Boiler]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n   Closed      Open\r\n\r\nPatented Side Dusting Doors]\r\n\r\nThe large tube doors through which access is had to the front headers\r\nand the doors giving such access to the rear headers in boilers of the\r\nvertical header type have already been described and are shown clearly\r\nby the illustrations on pages 56 and 74. In boilers of the inclined\r\nheader type, access to the rear headers is secured through the chamber\r\nformed by the headers and the rear boiler wall. Large doors in the sides\r\nof the setting give full access to all parts for inspection and for\r\nremoval of accumulations of soot. Small dusting doors are supplied for\r\nthe side walls through which all of the heating surfaces may be cleaned\r\nby means of a steam dusting lance. These side dusting doors are a\r\npatented feature and the shutters are self closing. In wide boilers\r\nadditional cleaning doors are supplied at the top of the setting to\r\ninsure ease in reaching all portions of the heating surface.\r\n\r\nThe drums are accessible for inspection through the manhole openings.\r\nThe removal of the handhole plates makes possible the inspection of each\r\ntube for its full length and gives the assurance that no defect can\r\nexist that cannot be actually seen. This is particularly advantageous\r\nwhen inspecting for the presence of scale.\r\n\r\nThe materials entering into the construction of the Babcock & Wilcox\r\nboiler are the best obtainable for the special purpose for which they\r\nare used and are subjected to rigid inspection and tests.\r\n\r\nThe boilers are manufactured by means of the most modern shop equipment\r\nand appliances in the hands of an old and well-tried organization of\r\nskilled mechanics under the supervision of experienced engineers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Cast-iron Vertical Header Cross Drum Babcock & Wilcox\r\nBoiler]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADVANTAGES OF THE BABCOCK & WILCOX BOILER\r\n\r\n\r\nThe advantages of the Babcock & Wilcox boiler may perhaps be most\r\nclearly set forth by a consideration, 1st, of water-tube boilers as a\r\nclass as compared with shell and fire-tube boilers; and 2nd, of the\r\nBabcock & Wilcox boiler specifically as compared with other designs of\r\nwater-tube boilers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWATER-TUBE _VERSUS_ FIRE-TUBE BOILERS\r\n\r\n\r\nSafety--The most important requirement of a steam boiler is that it\r\nshall be safe in so far as danger from explosion is concerned. If the\r\nenergy in a large shell boiler under pressure is considered, the thought\r\nof the destruction possible in the case of an explosion is appalling.\r\nThe late Dr. Robert H. Thurston, Dean of Sibley College, Cornell\r\nUniversity, and past president of the American Society of Mechanical\r\nEngineers, estimated that there is sufficient energy stored in a plain\r\ncylinder boiler under 100 pounds steam pressure to project it in case of\r\nan explosion to a height of over 3½ miles; a locomotive boiler at 125\r\npounds pressure from one-half to one-third of a mile; and a 60\r\nhorse-power return tubular boiler under 75 pounds pressure somewhat over\r\na mile. To quote: \"A cubic foot of heated water under a pressure of from\r\n60 to 70 pounds per square inch has about the same energy as one pound\r\nof gunpowder.\" From such a consideration, it may be readily appreciated\r\nhow the advent of high pressure steam was one of the strongest factors\r\nin forcing the adoption of water-tube boilers. A consideration of the\r\nthickness of material necessary for cylinders of various diameters under\r\na steam pressure of 200 pounds and assuming an allowable stress of\r\n12,000 pounds per square inch, will perhaps best illustrate this point.\r\nTable 1 gives such thicknesses for various diameters of cylinders not\r\ntaking into consideration the weakening effect of any joints which may\r\nbe necessary. The rapidity with which the plate thickness increases with\r\nthe diameter is apparent and in practice, due to the fact that riveted\r\njoints must be used, the thicknesses as given in the table, with the\r\nexception of the first, must be increased from 30 to 40 per cent.\r\n\r\nIn a water-tube boiler the drums seldom exceed 48 inches in diameter and\r\nthe thickness of plate required, therefore, is never excessive. The\r\nthinner metal can be rolled to a more uniform quality, the seams admit\r\nof better proportioning, and the joints can be more easily and perfectly\r\nfitted than is the case where thicker plates are necessary. All of these\r\npoints contribute toward making the drums of water-tube boilers better\r\nable to withstand the stress which they will be called upon to endure.\r\n\r\nThe essential constructive difference between water-tube and fire-tube\r\nboilers lies in the fact that the former is composed of parts of\r\nrelatively small diameter as against the large diameters necessary in\r\nthe latter.\r\n\r\nThe factor of safety of the boiler parts which come in contact with the\r\nmost intense heat in water-tube boilers can be made much higher than\r\nwould be practicable in a shell boiler. Under the assumptions considered\r\nabove in connection with the thickness of plates required, a number 10\r\ngauge tube (0.134 inch), which is standard in Babcock & Wilcox boilers\r\nfor pressures up to 210 pounds under the same allowable stress as was\r\nused in computing Table 1, the safe working pressure for the tubes is\r\n870 pounds per square inch, indicating the very large margin of safety\r\nof such tubes as compared with that possible with the shell of a boiler.\r\n\r\n        TABLE 1\r\n\r\nPLATE THICKNESS REQUIRED\r\n  FOR VARIOUS CYLINDER\r\n       DIAMETERS\r\n\r\n   ALLOWABLE STRESS,\r\n   12000 POUNDS PER\r\n     SQUARE INCH,\r\n   200 POUNDS GAUGE\r\n  PRESSURE, NO JOINTS\r\n\r\n+---------+-----------+\r\n|Diameter | Thickness |\r\n|Inches   | Inches    |\r\n+---------+-----------+\r\n|     4   |   0.033   |\r\n|    36   |   0.300   |\r\n|    48   |   0.400   |\r\n|    60   |   0.500   |\r\n|    72   |   0.600   |\r\n|   108   |   0.900   |\r\n|   120   |   1.000   |\r\n|   144   |   1.200   |\r\n+---------+-----------+\r\n\r\nA further advantage in the water-tube boiler as a class is the\r\nelimination of all compressive stresses. Cylinders subjected to external\r\npressures, such as fire tubes or the internally fired furnaces of\r\ncertain types of boilers, will collapse under a pressure much lower than\r\nthat which they could withstand if it were applied internally. This is\r\ndue to the fact that if there exists any initial distortion from its\r\ntrue shape, the external pressure will tend to increase such distortion\r\nand collapse the cylinder, while an internal pressure tends to restore\r\nthe cylinder to its original shape.\r\n\r\nStresses due to unequal expansion have been a fruitful source of trouble\r\nin fire-tube boilers.\r\n\r\nIn boilers of the shell type, the riveted joints of the shell, with\r\ntheir consequent double thickness of metal exposed to the fire, gives\r\nrise to serious difficulties. Upon these points are concentrated all\r\nstrains of unequal expansion, giving rise to frequent leaks and\r\noftentimes to actual ruptures. Moreover, in the case of such rupture,\r\nthe whole body of contained water is liberated instantaneously and a\r\ndisastrous and usually fatal explosion results.\r\n\r\nFurther, unequal strains result in shell or fire-tube boilers due to the\r\ndifference in temperature of the various parts. This difference in\r\ntemperature results from the lack of positive well defined circulation.\r\nWhile such a circulation does not necessarily accompany all water-tube\r\ndesigns, in general, the circulation in water-tube boilers is much more\r\ndefined than in fire-tube or shell boilers.\r\n\r\nA positive and efficient circulation assures that all portions of the\r\npressure parts will be at approximately the same temperature and in this\r\nway strains resulting from unequal temperatures are obviated.\r\n\r\nIf a shell or fire-tubular boiler explodes, the apparatus as a whole is\r\ndestroyed. In the case of water-tube boilers, the drums are ordinarily\r\nso located that they are protected from intense heat and any rupture is\r\nusually in the case of a tube. Tube failures, resulting from blisters or\r\nburning, are not serious in their nature. Where a tube ruptures because\r\nof a flaw in the metal, the result may be more severe, but there cannot\r\nbe the disastrous explosion such as would occur in the case of the\r\nexplosion of a shell boiler.\r\n\r\nTo quote Dr. Thurston, relative to the greater safety of the water-tube\r\nboiler: \"The stored available energy is usually less than that of any of\r\nthe other stationary boilers and not very far from the amount stored,\r\npound for pound, in the plain tubular boiler. It is evident that their\r\nadmitted safety from destructive explosion does not come from this\r\nrelation, however, but from the division of the contents into small\r\nportions and especially from those details of construction which make it\r\ntolerably certain that any rupture shall be local. A violent explosion\r\ncan only come from the general disruption of a boiler and the liberation\r\nat once of large masses of steam and water.\"\r\n\r\nEconomy--The requirement probably next in importance to safety in a\r\nsteam boiler is economy in the use of fuel. To fulfill such a\r\nrequirement, the three items, of proper grate for the class of fuel to\r\nbe burned, a combustion chamber permitting complete combustion of gases\r\nbefore their escape to the stack, and the heating surface of such a\r\ncharacter and arrangement that the maximum amount of available heat may\r\nbe extracted, must be co-ordinated.\r\n\r\nFire-tube boilers from the nature of their design do not permit the\r\nvariety of combinations of grate surface, heating surface, and\r\ncombustion space possible in practically any water-tube boiler.\r\n\r\nIn securing the best results in fuel economy, the draft area in a boiler\r\nis an important consideration. In fire-tube boilers this area is limited\r\nto the cross sectional area of the fire tubes, a condition further\r\naggravated in a horizontal boiler by the tendency of the hot gases to\r\npass through the upper rows of tubes instead of through all of the tubes\r\nalike. In water-tube boilers the draft area is that of the space outside\r\nof the tubes and is hence much greater than the cross sectional area of\r\nthe tubes.\r\n\r\nCapacity--Due to the generally more efficient circulation found in\r\nwater-tube than in fire-tube boilers, rates of evaporation are possible\r\nwith water-tube boilers that cannot be approached where fire-tube\r\nboilers are employed.\r\n\r\nQuick Steaming--Another important result of the better circulation\r\nordinarily found in water-tube boilers is in their ability to raise\r\nsteam rapidly in starting and to meet the sudden demands that may be\r\nthrown on them.\r\n\r\nIn a properly designed water-tube boiler steam may be raised from a cold\r\nboiler to 200 pounds pressure in less than one-half hour.\r\n\r\nFor the sake of comparison with the figure above, it may be stated that\r\nin the U. S. Government Service the shortest time allowed for getting up\r\nsteam in Scotch marine boilers is 6 hours and the time ordinarily\r\nallowed is 12 hours. In large double-ended Scotch boilers, such as are\r\ngenerally used in Trans-Atlantic service, the fires are usually started\r\n24 hours before the time set for getting under way. This length of time\r\nis necessary for such boilers in order to eliminate as far as possible\r\nexcessive strains resulting from the sudden application of heat to the\r\nsurfaces.\r\n\r\nAccessibility--In the \"Requirements of a Perfect Steam Boiler\", as\r\nstated by Mr. Babcock, he demonstrates the necessity for complete\r\naccessibility to all portions of the boiler for cleaning, inspection and\r\nrepair.\r\n\r\nCleaning--When the great difference is realized in performance, both as\r\nto economy and capacity of a clean boiler and one in which the heating\r\nsurfaces have been allowed to become fouled, it may be appreciated that\r\nthe ability to keep heating surfaces clean internally and externally is\r\na factor of the highest importance.\r\n\r\nSuch results can be accomplished only by the use of a design in boiler\r\nconstruction which gives complete accessibility to all portions. In\r\nfire-tube boilers the tubes are frequently nested together with a space\r\nbetween them often less than 1¼ inches and, as a consequence, nearly the\r\nentire tube surface is inaccessible. When scale forms upon such tubes it\r\nis impossible to remove it completely from the inside of the boiler and\r\nif it is removed by a turbine hammer, there is no way of knowing how\r\nthorough a job has been done. With the formation of such scale there is\r\ndanger through overheating and frequent tube renewals are necessary.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Portion of 29,000 Horse-power Installation of Babcock &\r\nWilcox Boilers in the L Street Station of the Edison Electric\r\nIlluminating Co. of Boston, Mass. This Company Operates in its Various\r\nStations a Total of 39,000 Horse Power of Babcock & Wilcox Boilers]\r\n\r\nIn Scotch marine boilers, even with the engines operating condensing,\r\ncomplete tube renewals at intervals of six or seven years are required,\r\nwhile large replacements are often necessary in less than one year. In\r\nreturn tubular boilers operated with bad feed water, complete tube\r\nrenewals annually are not uncommon. In this type of boiler much sediment\r\nfalls on the bottom sheets where the intense heat to which they are\r\nsubjected bakes it to such an excessive hardness that the only method of\r\nremoving it is to chisel it out. This can be done only by omitting tubes\r\nenough to leave a space into which a man can crawl and the discomforts\r\nunder which he must work are apparent. Unless such a deposit is removed,\r\na burned and buckled plate will invariably result, and if neglected too\r\nlong an explosion will follow.\r\n\r\nIn vertical fire-tube boilers using a water leg construction, a deposit\r\nof mud in such legs is an active agent in causing corrosion and the\r\ndifficulty of removing such deposit through handholes is well known. A\r\ncomplete removal is practically impossible and as a last resort to\r\nobviate corrosion in certain designs, the bottom of the water legs in\r\nsome cases have been made of copper. A thick layer of mud and scale is\r\nalso liable to accumulate on the crown sheet of such boilers and may\r\ncause the sheet to crack and lead to an explosion.\r\n\r\nThe soot and fine coal swept along with the gases by the draft will\r\nsettle in fire tubes and unless removed promptly, must be cut out with a\r\nspecial form of scraper. It is not unusual where soft coal is used to\r\nfind tubes half filled with soot, which renders useless a large portion\r\nof the heating surface and so restricts the draft as to make it\r\ndifficult to burn sufficient coal to develop the required power from\r\nsuch heating surface as is not covered by soot.\r\n\r\nWater-tube boilers in general are from the nature of their design more\r\nreadily accessible for cleaning than are fire-tube boilers.\r\n\r\nInspection--The objections given above in the consideration of the\r\ninability to properly clean fire-tube boilers hold as well for the\r\ninspection of such boilers.\r\n\r\nRepairs--The lack of accessibility in fire-tube boilers further leads to\r\ndifficulties where repairs are required.\r\n\r\nIn fire-tube boilers tube renewals are a serious undertaking. The\r\naccumulation of hard deposit on the exterior of the surfaces so enlarges\r\nthe tubes that it is oftentimes difficult, if not impossible, to draw\r\nthem through the tube sheets and it is usually necessary to cut out such\r\ntubes as will allow access to the one which has failed and remove them\r\nthrough the manhole.\r\n\r\nWhen a tube sheet blisters, the defective part must be cut out by\r\nhand-tapped holes drilled by ratchets and as it is frequently impossible\r\nto get space in which to drive rivets, a \"soft patch\" is necessary. This\r\nis but a makeshift at best and usually results in either a reduction of\r\nthe safe working pressure or in the necessity for a new plate. If the\r\nlatter course is followed, the old plate must be cut out, a new one\r\nscribed to place to locate rivet holes and in order to obtain room for\r\ndriving rivets, the boiler will have to be re-tubed.\r\n\r\nThe setting must, of course, be at least partially torn out and\r\nreplaced.\r\n\r\nIn case of repairs, of such nature in fire-tube boilers, the working\r\npressure of such repaired boilers will frequently be lowered by the\r\ninsurance companies when the boiler is again placed in service.\r\n\r\nIn the case of a rupture in a water-tube boiler, the loss will\r\nordinarily be limited to one or two tubes which can be readily replaced.\r\nThe fire-tube boiler will be so completely demolished that the question\r\nof repairs will be shifted from the boiler to the surrounding property,\r\nthe damage to which will usually exceed many times the cost of a boiler\r\nof a type which would have eliminated the possibility of a disastrous\r\nexplosion. In considering the proper repair cost of the two types of\r\nboilers, the fact should not be overlooked that it is poor economy to\r\ninvest large sums in equipment that, through a possible accident to the\r\nboiler may be wholly destroyed or so damaged that the cost of repairs,\r\ntogether with the loss of time while such repairs are being made, would\r\npurchase boilers of absolute safety and leave a large margin beside. The\r\npossibility of loss of human life should also be considered, though this\r\nmay seem a far cry from the question of repair costs.\r\n\r\nSpace Occupied--The space required for the boilers in a plant often\r\nexceeds the requirements for the remainder of the plant equipment. Any\r\nsaving of space in a boiler room will be a large factor in reducing the\r\ncost of real estate and of the building. Even when the boiler plant is\r\ncomparatively small, the saving in space frequently will amount to a\r\nconsiderable percentage of the cost of the boilers.

In boilers\r\nusing water-leg construction, there is danger of defective circulation,\r\nleaks are common, and unsuspected corrosion may be going on in portions\r\nof the boiler that cannot be inspected. Stresses due to unequal\r\nexpansion of the metal cannot be well avoided but they may be minimized\r\nby maintaining at the same temperature all pressure parts of the boiler.\r\nThe result is to be secured only by means of a well defined circulation.\r\n\r\nThe main feature to which the Babcock & Wilcox boiler owes its safety is\r\nthe construction made possible by the use of headers, by which the water\r\nin each vertical row of tubes is separated from that in the adjacent\r\nrows. This construction results in the very efficient circulation\r\nproduced through the breaking up of the steam and water in the front\r\nheaders, the effect of these headers in producing such a positive\r\ncirculation having been clearly demonstrated in Mr. Babcock's lecture.\r\nThe use of a number of sections, thus composed of headers and tubes, has\r\na distinct advantage over the use of a common chamber at the outlet ends\r\nof the tubes. In the former case the circulation of water in one\r\nvertical row of tubes cannot interfere with that in the other rows,\r\nwhile in the latter construction there will be downward as well as\r\nupward currents and such downward currents tend to neutralize any good\r\neffect there might be through the diminution of the density of the water\r\ncolumn by the steam.\r\n\r\nFurther, the circulation results directly from the design of the boiler\r\nand requires no assistance from \"retarders\", check valves and the like,\r\nwithin the boiler. All such mechanical devices in the interior of a\r\nboiler serve only to complicate the design and should not be used.\r\n\r\nThis positive and efficient circulation assures that all portions of the\r\npressure parts of the Babcock & Wilcox boiler will be at approximately\r\nthe same temperature and in this way strains resulting from unequal\r\ntemperatures are obviated.\r\n\r\nWhere the water throughout the boiler is at the temperature of the steam\r\ncontained, a condition to be secured only by proper circulation, danger\r\nfrom internal pitting is minimized, or at least limited only to effects\r\nof the water fed the boiler. Where the water in any portion of the\r\nboiler is lower than the temperature of the steam corresponding to the\r\npressure carried, whether the fact that such lower temperatures exist as\r\na result of lack of circulation, or because of intentional design,\r\ninternal pitting or corrosion will almost invariably result.\r\n\r\nDr. Thurston has already been quoted to the effect that the admitted\r\nsafety of a water-tube boiler is the result of the division of its\r\ncontents into small portions. In boilers using a water-leg construction,\r\nwhile the danger from explosion will be largely limited to the tubes,\r\nthere is the danger, however, that such legs may explode due to the\r\ndeterioration of their stays, and such an explosion might be almost as\r\ndisastrous as that of a shell boiler. The headers in a Babcock & Wilcox\r\nboiler are practically free from any danger of explosion. Were such an\r\nexplosion to occur, it would still be localized to a much larger extent\r\nthan in the case of a water-leg boiler and the header construction thus\r\nalmost absolutely localizes any danger from such a cause.\r\n\r\nStaybolts are admittedly an undesirable element of construction in any\r\nboiler. They are wholly objectionable and the only reason for the\r\npresence of staybolts in a boiler is to enable a cheaper form of\r\nconstruction to be used than if they were eliminated.\r\n\r\nIn boilers utilizing in their design flat-stayed surfaces, or staybolt\r\nconstruction under pressure, corrosion and wear and tear in service\r\ntends to weaken some single part subject to continual strain, the result\r\nbeing an increased strain on other parts greatly in excess of that for\r\nwhich an allowance can be made by any reasonable factor of safety. Where\r\nthe construction is such that the weakening of a single part will\r\nproduce a marked decrease in the safety and reliability of the whole, it\r\nfollows of necessity, that there will be a corresponding decrease in the\r\nworking pressure which may be safely carried.\r\n\r\nIn water-leg boilers, the use of such flat-stayed surfaces under\r\npressure presents difficulties that are practically unsurmountable. Such\r\nsurfaces exposed to the heat of the fire are subject to unequal\r\nexpansion, distortion, leakage and corrosion, or in general, to many of\r\nthe objections that have already been advanced against the fire-tube\r\nboilers in the consideration of water-tube boilers as a class in\r\ncomparison with fire-tube boilers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: McAlpin Hotel, New York City, Operating 2360 Horse Power\r\nof Babcock & Wilcox Boilers]\r\n\r\nAside from the difficulties that may arise in actual service due to the\r\nfailure of staybolts, or in general, due to the use of flat-stayed\r\nsurfaces, constructional features are encountered in the actual\r\nmanufacture of such boilers that make it difficult if not impossible to\r\nproduce a first-class mechanical job. It is practically impossible in\r\nthe building of such a boiler to so design and place the staybolts that\r\nall will be under equal strain. Such unequal strains, resulting from\r\nconstructional difficulties, will be greatly multiplied when such a\r\nboiler is placed in service. Much of the riveting in boilers of this\r\ndesign must of necessity be hand work, which is never the equal of\r\nmachine riveting. The use of water-leg construction ordinarily requires\r\nthe flanging of large plates, which is difficult, and because of the\r\nnumber of heats necessary and the continual working of the material, may\r\nlead to the weakening of such plates.\r\n\r\nIn vertical or semi-vertical water-tube boilers utilizing flat-stayed\r\nsurfaces under pressure, these surfaces are ordinarily so located as to\r\noffer a convenient lodging place for flue dust, which fuses into a hard\r\nmass, is difficult of removal and under which corrosion may be going on\r\nwith no possibility of detection.\r\n\r\nWhere stayed surfaces or water legs are features in the design of a\r\nwater-tube boiler, the factor of safety of such parts must be most\r\ncarefully considered. In such parts too, is the determination of the\r\nfactor most difficult, and because of the \"rule-of-thumb\" determination\r\nfrequently necessary, the factor of safety becomes in reality a factor\r\nof ignorance. As opposed to such indeterminate factors of safety, in the\r\nBabcock & Wilcox boiler, when the factor of safety for the drum or drums\r\nhas been determined, and such a factor may be determined accurately, the\r\nfactors for all other portions of the pressure parts are greatly in\r\nexcess of that of the drum. All Babcock & Wilcox boilers are built with\r\na factor of safety of at least five, and inasmuch as the factor of the\r\nsafety of the tubes and headers is greatly in excess of this figure, it\r\napplies specifically to the drum or drums. This factor represents a\r\ngreater degree of safety than a considerably higher factor applied to a\r\nboiler in which the shell or any riveted portion is acted upon directly\r\nby the fire, or the same factor applied to a boiler utilizing\r\nflat-stayed surface construction, where the accurate determination of\r\nthe limiting factor of safety is difficult, if not impossible.\r\n\r\nThat the factor of safety of stayed surfaces is questionable may perhaps\r\nbe best realized from a consideration of the severe requirements as to\r\nsuch factor called for by the rules and regulations of the Board of\r\nSupervising Inspectors, U. S. Government.\r\n\r\nIn view of the above, the absence of any stayed surfaces in the Babcock\r\n& Wilcox boiler is obviously a distinguishing advantage where safety is\r\na factor. It is of interest to note, in the article on the evolution of\r\nthe Babcock & Wilcox boiler, that staybolt construction was used in\r\nseveral designs, found unsatisfactory and unsafe, and discarded.\r\n\r\nAnother feature in the design of the Babcock & Wilcox boiler tending\r\ntoward added safety is its manner of suspension. This has been indicated\r\nin the previous chapter and is of such nature that all of the pressure\r\nparts are free to expand or contract under variations of temperature\r\nwithout in any way interfering with any part of the boiler setting. The\r\nsectional nature of the boiler allows a flexibility under varying\r\ntemperature changes that practically obviates internal strain.\r\n\r\nIn boilers utilizing water-leg construction, on the other hand, the\r\nconstruction is rigid, giving rise to serious internal strains and the\r\nmethod of support ordinarily made necessary by the boiler design is not\r\nonly unmechanical but frequently dangerous, due to the fact that proper\r\nprovision is not made for expansion and contraction under temperature\r\nvariations.\r\n\r\nBoilers utilizing water-leg construction are not ordinarily provided\r\nwith mud drums. This is a serious defect in that it allows impurities\r\nand sediment to collect in a portion of the boiler not easily inspected,\r\nand corrosion may result.\r\n\r\nEconomy--That the water-tube boiler as a class lends itself more readily\r\nthan does the fire-tube boiler to a variation in the relation of grate\r\nsurface, heating surface and combustion space has been already pointed\r\nout. In economy again, the construction made possible by the use of\r\nheaders in Babcock & Wilcox boilers appears as a distinct advantage.\r\nBecause of this construction, there is a flexibility possible, in an\r\nunlimited variety of heights and widths that will satisfactorily meet\r\nthe special requirements of the fuel to be burned in individual cases.\r\n\r\nAn extended experience in the design of furnaces best suited for a wide\r\nvariety of fuels has made The Babcock & Wilcox Co. leaders in the field\r\nof economy. Furnaces have been built and are in successful operation for\r\nburning anthracite and bituminous coals, lignite, crude oil, gas-house\r\ntar, wood, sawdust and shavings, bagasse, tan bark, natural gas, blast\r\nfurnace gas, by-product coke oven gas and for the utilization of waste\r\nheat from commercial processes. The great number of Babcock & Wilcox\r\nboilers now in satisfactory operation under such a wide range of fuel\r\nconditions constitutes an unimpeachable testimonial to the ability to\r\nmeet all of the many conditions of service.\r\n\r\nThe limitations in the draft area of fire-tube boilers as affecting\r\neconomy have been pointed out. That a greater draft area is possible in\r\nwater-tube boilers does not of necessity indicate that proper advantage\r\nof this fact is taken in all boilers of the water-tube class. In the\r\nBabcock & Wilcox boiler, the large draft area taken in connection with\r\nthe effective baffling allows the gases to be brought into intimate\r\ncontact with all portions of the heating surfaces and renders such\r\nsurfaces highly efficient.\r\n\r\nIn certain designs of water-tube boilers the baffling is such as to\r\nrender ineffective certain portions of the heating surface, due to the\r\ntendency of soot and dirt to collect on or behind baffles, in this way\r\ncausing the interposition of a layer of non-conducting material between\r\nthe hot gases and the heating surfaces.\r\n\r\nIn Babcock & Wilcox boilers the standard baffle arrangement is such as\r\nto allow the installation of a superheater without in any way altering\r\nthe path of the gases from furnace to stack, or requiring a change in\r\nthe boiler design. In certain water-tube boilers the baffle arrangement\r\nis such that if a superheater is to be installed a complete change in\r\nthe ordinary baffle design is necessary. Frequently to insure\r\nsufficiently hot gas striking the heating surfaces, a portion is\r\nby-passed directly from the furnace to the superheater chamber without\r\npassing over any of the boiler heating surfaces. Any such arrangement\r\nwill lead to a decrease in economy and the use of boilers requiring it\r\nshould be avoided.\r\n\r\nCapacity--Babcock & Wilcox boilers are run successfully in every-day\r\npractice at higher ratings than any other boilers in practical service.\r\nThe capacities thus obtainable are due directly to the efficient\r\ncirculation already pointed out. Inasmuch as the construction utilizing\r\nheaders has a direct bearing in producing such circulation, it is also\r\nconnected with the high capacities obtainable with this apparatus.\r\n\r\nWhere intelligently handled and kept properly cleaned, Babcock & Wilcox\r\nboilers are operated in many plants at from 200 to 225 per cent of their\r\nrated evaporative capacity and it is not unusual for them to be operated\r\nat 300 per cent of such rated capacity during periods of peak load.\r\n\r\nDry Steam--In the list of the requirements of the perfect steam boiler,\r\nthe necessity that dry steam be generated has been pointed out. The\r\nBabcock & Wilcox boiler will deliver dry steam under higher capacities\r\nand poorer conditions of feed water than any other boiler now\r\nmanufactured. Certain boilers will, when operated at ordinary ratings,\r\nhandle poor feed water and deliver steam in which the moisture content\r\nis not objectionable. When these same boilers are driven at high\r\noverloads, there will be a direct tendency to prime and the percentage\r\nof moisture in the steam delivered will be high. This tendency is the\r\nresult of the lack of proper circulation and once more there is seen the\r\nadvantage of the headers of the Babcock & Wilcox boiler, resulting as it\r\ndoes in the securing of a positive circulation.\r\n\r\nIn the design of the Babcock & Wilcox boiler sufficient space is\r\nprovided between the steam outlet and the disengaging point to insure\r\nthe steam passing from the boiler in a dry state without entraining or\r\nagain picking up any particles of water in its passage even at high\r\nrates of evaporation. Ample time is given for a complete separation of\r\nsteam from the water at the disengaging surface before the steam is\r\ncarried from the boiler. These two features, which are additional causes\r\nfor the ability of the Babcock & Wilcox boiler to deliver dry steam,\r\nresult from the proper proportioning of the steam and water space of the\r\nboiler. From the history of the development of the boiler, it is evident\r\nthat the cubical capacity per horse power of the steam and water space\r\nhas been adopted after numerous experiments.\r\n\r\nThat the \"dry pipe\" serves in no way the generally understood function\r\nof such device has been pointed out. As stated, the function of the \"dry\r\npipe\" in a Babcock & Wilcox boiler is simply that of a collecting pipe\r\nand this statement holds true regardless of the rate of operation of the\r\nboiler.\r\n\r\nIn certain boilers, \"superheating surface\" is provided to \"dry the\r\nsteam,\" or to remove the moisture due to priming or foaming. Such\r\nsurface is invariably a source of trouble unless the steam is initially\r\ndry and a boiler which will deliver dry steam is obviously to be\r\npreferred to one in which surface must be supplied especially for such\r\npurpose. Where superheaters are installed with Babcock & Wilcox boilers,\r\nthey are in every sense of the word superheaters and not driers, the\r\nsteam being delivered to them in a dry state.\r\n\r\nThe question has been raised in connection with the cross drum design of\r\nthe Babcock & Wilcox boiler as to its ability to deliver dry steam.\r\nExperience has shown the absolute lack of basis for any such objection.\r\nThe Babcock & Wilcox Company at its Bayonne Works some time ago made a\r\nseries of experiments to see in what manner the steam generated was\r\nseparated from the water either in the drum or in its passage to the\r\ndrum. Glass peepholes were installed in each end of a drum in a boiler\r\nof the marine design, at the point midway between that at which the\r\nhorizontal circulating tubes entered the drum and the drum baffle plate.\r\nBy holding a light at one of these peepholes the action in the drum was\r\nclearly seen through the other. It was found that with the boiler\r\noperated under three-quarter inch ashpit pressure, which, with the fuel\r\nused would be equivalent to approximately 185 per cent of rating for\r\nstationary boiler practice, that each tube was delivering with great\r\nvelocity a stream of solid water, which filled the tube for half its\r\ncross sectional area. There was no spray or mist accompanying such\r\ndelivery, clearly indicating that the steam had entirely separated from\r\nthe water in its passage through the horizontal circulating tubes, which\r\nin the boiler in question were but 50 inches long.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Northwest Station of the Commonwealth Edison Co.,\r\nChicago, Ill. This Installation Consists of 11,360 Horse Power of\r\nBabcock & Wilcox Boilers and Superheaters, Equipped with Babcock &\r\nWilcox Chain Grate Stokers]\r\n\r\nThese experiments proved conclusively that the size of the steam drums\r\nin the cross drum design has no appreciable effect in determining the\r\namount of liberating surface, and that sufficient liberating surface is\r\nprovided in the circulating tubes alone. If further proof of the ability\r\nof this design of boiler to deliver dry steam is required, such proof is\r\nperhaps best seen in the continued use of the Babcock & Wilcox marine\r\nboiler, in which the cross drum is used exclusively, and with which\r\nrates of evaporation are obtained far in excess of those secured in\r\nordinary practice.\r\n\r\nQuick Steaming--The advantages of water-tube boilers as a class over\r\nfire-tube boilers in ability to raise steam quickly have been indicated.\r\n\r\nDue to the constant and thorough circulation resulting from the\r\nsectional nature of the Babcock & Wilcox boiler, steam may be raised\r\nmore rapidly than in practically any other water-tube design.\r\n\r\nIn starting up a cold Babcock & Wilcox boiler with either coal or oil\r\nfuel, where a proper furnace arrangement is supplied, steam may be\r\nraised to a pressure of 200 pounds in less than half an hour. With a\r\nBabcock & Wilcox boiler in a test where forced draft was available,\r\nsteam was raised from an initial temperature of the boiler and its\r\ncontained water of 72 degrees to a pressure of 200 pounds, in 12½\r\nminutes after lighting the fire. The boiler also responds quickly in\r\nstarting from banked fires, especially where forced draft is available.\r\n\r\nIn Babcock & Wilcox boilers the water is divided into many small streams\r\nwhich circulate without undue frictional resistance in thin envelopes\r\npassing through the hottest part of the furnace, the steam being carried\r\nrapidly to the disengaging surface. There is no part of the boiler\r\nexposed to the heat of the fire that is not in contact with water\r\ninternally, and as a result there is no danger of overheating on\r\nstarting up quickly nor can leaks occur from unequal expansion such as\r\nmight be the case where an attempt is made to raise steam rapidly in\r\nboilers using water leg construction.\r\n\r\nStorage Capacity for Steam and Water--Where sufficient steam and water\r\ncapacity are not provided in a boiler, its action will be irregular, the\r\nsteam pressure varying over wide limits and the water level being\r\nsubject to frequent and rapid fluctuation.\r\n\r\nOwing to the small relative weight of steam, water capacity is of\r\ngreater importance in this respect than steam space. With a gauge\r\npressure of 180 pounds per square inch, 8 cubic feet of steam, which is\r\nequivalent to one-half cubic foot of water space, are required to supply\r\none boiler horse power for one minute and if no heat be supplied to the\r\nboiler during such an interval, the pressure will drop to 150 pounds per\r\nsquare inch. The volume of steam space, therefore, may be over rated,\r\nbut if this be too small, the steam passing off will carry water with it\r\nin the form of spray. Too great a water space results in slow steaming\r\nand waste of fuel in starting up; while too much steam space adds to the\r\nradiating surface and increases the losses from that cause.\r\n\r\nThat the steam and water space of the Babcock & Wilcox boiler are the\r\nresult of numerous experiments has previously been pointed out.\r\n\r\nAccessibility--Cleaning. That water-tube boilers are more accessible as\r\na class than are fire-tube boilers has been indicated. All water-tube\r\nboilers, however, are not equally accessible. In certain designs, due to\r\nthe arrangement of baffling used it is practically impossible to remove\r\nall deposits of soot and dirt. Frequently, in order to cheapen the\r\nproduct, sufficient cleaning and access doors are not supplied as part\r\nof the boiler equipment. The tendency of soot to collect on the crown\r\nsheets of certain vertical water-tube boilers has been noted. Such\r\ndeposits are difficult to remove and if corrosion goes on beneath such a\r\ncovering the sheet may crack and an explosion result.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Rear View--Longitudinal Drum Vertical Header Boiler,\r\nShowing Access Doors to Rear Headers]\r\n\r\nIt is almost impossible to thoroughly clean water legs internally, and\r\nin such places also is there a tendency to unsuspected corrosion under\r\ndeposits that cannot be removed.\r\n\r\nIn Babcock & Wilcox boilers every portion of the interior of the heating\r\nsurfaces can be reached and kept clean, while any soot deposited on the\r\nexterior surfaces can be blown off while the boiler is under pressure.\r\n\r\nInspection--The accessibility which makes possible the thorough cleaning\r\nof all portions of the Babcock & Wilcox boiler also provides a means for\r\na thorough inspection.\r\n\r\nDrums are accessible for internal inspection by the removal of the\r\nmanhole plates. Front headers may be inspected through large doors\r\nfurnished for the purpose. Rear headers in the inclined header designs\r\nmay be inspected from the chamber formed by such headers and the rear\r\nwall of the boiler. In the vertical header designs rear tube doors are\r\nfurnished, as has been stated. In certain designs of water-tube boilers\r\nin order to assure accessibility for inspection of the rear ends of the\r\ntubes, the rear portion of the boiler is exposed to the atmosphere with\r\nresulting excessive radiation losses. In other designs the means of\r\naccess to the rear ends of the tubes are of a makeshift and\r\nunworkmanlike character.\r\n\r\nBy the removal of handhole plates, all tubes in a Babcock & Wilcox\r\nboiler may be inspected for their full length either for the presence of\r\nscale or for suspected corrosion.\r\n\r\nRepairs--In Babcock & Wilcox boilers the possession of great strength,\r\nthe elimination of stresses due to uneven temperatures and of the\r\nresulting danger of leaks and corrosion, the protection of the drums\r\nfrom the intense heat of the fire, and the decreased liability of the\r\nscale forming matter to lodge on the hottest tube surfaces, all tend to\r\nminimize the necessity for repairs. The tubes of the Babcock & Wilcox\r\nboiler are practically the only part which may need renewal and these\r\nonly at infrequent intervals When necessary, such renewals may be made\r\ncheaply and quickly. A small stock of tubes, 4 inches in diameter, of\r\nsufficient length for the boiler used, is all that need be carried to\r\nmake renewals.\r\n\r\nRepairs in water-leg boilers are difficult at best and frequently\r\nunsatisfactory when completed. When staybolt replacements are necessary,\r\nin order to get at the inner sheet of the water leg, several tubes must\r\nin some cases be cut out. Not infrequently a replacement of an entire\r\nwater leg is necessary and this is difficult and requires a lengthy\r\nshutdown. With the Babcock & Wilcox boiler, on the other hand, even if\r\nit is necessary to replace a section, this may be done in a few hours\r\nafter the boiler is cool.\r\n\r\nIn the case of certain staybolt failures the working pressure of a\r\nrepaired boiler utilizing such construction will frequently be lowered\r\nby the insurance companies when the boiler is again placed in service.\r\nThe sectional nature of the Babcock & Wilcox boiler enables it to\r\nmaintain its original working pressure over long periods of time, almost\r\nregardless of the nature of any repair that may be required.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 1456 Horse-power Installation of Babcock & Wilcox Boilers\r\nat the Raritan Woolen Mills, Raritan, N. J. The First of These Boilers\r\nwere Installed in 1878 and 1881 and are still Operated at 80 Pounds\r\nPressure]\r\n\r\nDurability--Babcock & Wilcox boilers are being operated in every-day\r\nservice with entirely satisfactory results and under the same steam\r\npressure as that for which they were originally sold that have been\r\noperated from thirty to thirty-five years. It is interesting to note in\r\nconsidering the life of a boiler that the length of life of a Babcock &\r\nWilcox boiler must be taken as the criterion of what length of life is\r\npossible. This is due to the fact that there are Babcock & Wilcox\r\nboilers in operation to-day that have been in service from a time that\r\nantedates by a considerable margin that at which the manufacturer of any\r\nother water-tube boiler now on the market was started.\r\n\r\nProbably the very best evidence of the value of the Babcock & Wilcox\r\nboiler as a steam generator and of the reliability of the apparatus, is\r\nseen in the sales of the company. Since the company was formed, there\r\nhave been sold throughout the world over 9,900,000 horse power.\r\n\r\nA feature that cannot be overlooked in the consideration of the\r\nadvantages of the Babcock & Wilcox boiler is the fact that as a part of\r\nthe organization back of the boiler, there is a body of engineers of\r\nrecognized ability, ready at all times to assist its customers in every\r\npossible way.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 2400 Horse-power Installation of Babcock & Wilcox Boilers\r\nin the Union Station Power House of the Pennsylvania Railroad Co.,\r\nPittsburgh, Pa. This Company has a Total of 28,500 Horse Power of\r\nBabcock & Wilcox Boilers Installed]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHEAT AND ITS MEASUREMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nThe usual conception of heat is that it is a form of energy produced by\r\nthe vibratory motion of the minute particles or molecules of a body. All\r\nbodies are assumed to be composed of these molecules, which are held\r\ntogether by mutual cohesion and yet are in a state of continual\r\nvibration. The hotter a body or the more heat added to it, the more\r\nvigorous will be the vibrations of the molecules.\r\n\r\nAs is well known, the effect of heat on a body may be to change its\r\ntemperature, its volume, or its state, that is, from solid to liquid or\r\nfrom liquid to gaseous. Where water is melted from ice and evaporated\r\ninto steam, the various changes are admirably described in the lecture\r\nby Mr. Babcock on \"The Theory of Steam Making\", given in the next\r\nchapter.\r\n\r\nThe change in temperature of a body is ordinarily measured by\r\nthermometers, though for very high temperatures so-called pyrometers are\r\nused. The latter are dealt with under the heading \"High Temperature\r\nMeasurements\" at the end of this chapter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 11]\r\n\r\nBy reason of the uniform expansion of mercury and its great\r\nsensitiveness to heat, it is the fluid most commonly used in the\r\nconstruction of thermometers. In all thermometers the freezing point and\r\nthe boiling point of water, under mean or average atmospheric pressure\r\nat sea level, are assumed as two fixed points, but the division of the\r\nscale between these two points varies in different countries. The\r\nfreezing point is determined by the use of melting ice and for this\r\nreason is often called the melting point. There are in use three\r\nthermometer scales known as the Fahrenheit, the Centigrade or Celsius,\r\nand the Réaumur. As shown in Fig. 11, in the Fahrenheit scale, the space\r\nbetween the two fixed points is divided into 180 parts; the boiling\r\npoint is marked 212, and the freezing point is marked 32, and zero is a\r\ntemperature which, at the time this thermometer was invented, was\r\nincorrectly imagined to be the lowest temperature attainable. In the\r\ncentigrade and the Réaumur scales, the distance between the two fixed\r\npoints is divided into 100 and 80 parts, respectively. In each of these\r\ntwo scales the freezing point is marked zero, and the boiling point is\r\nmarked 100 in the centigrade and 80 in the Réaumur. Each of the 180, 100\r\nor 80 divisions in the respective thermometers is called a degree.\r\n\r\nTable 3 and appended formulae are useful for converting from one scale\r\nto another.\r\n\r\nIn the United States the bulbs of high-grade thermometers are usually\r\nmade of either Jena 58^{III} borosilicate thermometer glass or Jena\r\n16^{III} glass, the stems being made of ordinary glass. The Jena\r\n16^{III} glass is not suitable for use at temperatures much above 850\r\ndegrees Fahrenheit and the harder Jena 59^{III} should be used in\r\nthermometers for temperatures higher than this.\r\n\r\nBelow the boiling point, the hydrogen-gas thermometer is the almost\r\nuniversal standard with which mercurial thermometers may be compared,\r\nwhile above this point the nitrogen-gas thermometer is used. In both of\r\nthese standards the change in temperature is measured by the change in\r\npressure of a constant volume of the gas.\r\n\r\nIn graduating a mercurial thermometer for the Fahrenheit scale,\r\nordinarily a degree is represented as 1/180 part of the volume of the\r\nstem between the readings at the melting point of ice and the boiling\r\npoint of water. For temperatures above the latter, the scale is extended\r\nin degrees of the same volume. For very accurate work, however, the\r\nthermometer may be graduated to read true-gas-scale temperatures by\r\ncomparing it with the gas thermometer and marking the temperatures at 25\r\nor 50 degree intervals. Each degree is then 1/25 or 1/50 of the volume\r\nof the stem in each interval.\r\n\r\nEvery thermometer, especially if intended for use above the boiling\r\npoint, should be suitably annealed before it is used. If this is not\r\ndone, the true melting point and also the \"fundamental interval\", that\r\nis, the interval between the melting and the boiling points, may change\r\nconsiderably. After continued use at the higher temperatures also, the\r\nmelting point will change, so that the thermometer must be calibrated\r\noccasionally to insure accurate readings.\r\n\r\n                     TABLE 3\r\n\r\n         COMPARISON OF THERMOMETER SCALES\r\n\r\n+---------------+----------+----------+----------+\r\n|               |Fahrenheit|Centigrade|  Réaumur |\r\n+---------------+----------+----------+----------+\r\n|Absolute Zero  | -459.64  | -273.13  | -218.50  |\r\n|               |    0     |  -17.78  |  -14.22  |\r\n|               |   10     |  -12.22  |   -9.78  |\r\n|               |   20     |   -6.67  |   -5.33  |\r\n|               |   30     |   -1.11  |   -0.89  |\r\n|Freezing Point |   32     |    0     |    0     |\r\n|Maximum Density|          |          |          |\r\n|  of Water     |   39.1   |    3.94  |    3.15  |\r\n|               |   50     |   10     |    8     |\r\n|               |   75     |   23.89  |   19.11  |\r\n|               |  100     |   37.78  |   30.22  |\r\n|               |  200     |   93.33  |   74.67  |\r\n|Boiling Point  |  212     |  100     |   80     |\r\n|               |  250     |  121.11  |   96.89  |\r\n|               |  300     |  148.89  |  119.11  |\r\n|               |  350     |  176.67  |  141.33  |\r\n+---------------+----------+----------+----------+\r\n\r\nF = 9/5C+32° = 9/4R+32°\r\n\r\nC = 5/9(F-32°) = 5/4R\r\n\r\nR = 4/9(F-32°) = 4/5C\r\n\r\nAs a general rule thermometers are graduated to read correctly for total\r\nimmersion, that is, with bulb and stem of the thermometer at the same\r\ntemperature, and they should be used in this way when compared with a\r\nstandard thermometer. If the stem emerges into space either hotter or\r\ncolder than that in which the bulb is placed, a \"stem correction\" must\r\nbe applied to the observed temperature in addition to any correction\r\nthat may be found in the comparison with the standard. For instance, for\r\na particular thermometer, comparison with the standard with both fully\r\nimmersed made necessary the following corrections:\r\n\r\n_Temperature_  _Correction_\r\n     40°F          0.0\r\n    100            0.0\r\n    200            0.0\r\n    300           +2.5\r\n    400           -0.5\r\n    500           -2.5\r\n\r\nWhen the sign of the correction is positive (+) it must be added to the\r\nobserved reading, and when the sign is a negative (-) the correction\r\nmust be subtracted. The formula for the stem correction is as follows:\r\n\r\nStem correction = 0.000085 × n (T-t)\r\n\r\nin which T is the observed temperature, t is the mean temperature of the\r\nemergent column, n is the number of degrees of mercury column emergent,\r\nand 0.000085 is the difference between the coefficient of expansion of\r\nthe mercury and that in the glass in the stem.\r\n\r\nSuppose the observed temperature is 400 degrees and the thermometer is\r\nimmersed to the 200 degrees mark, so that 200 degrees of the mercury\r\ncolumn project into the air. The mean temperature of the emergent column\r\nmay be found by tying another thermometer on the stem with the bulb at\r\nthe middle of the emergent mercury column as in Fig. 12. Suppose this\r\nmean temperature is 85 degrees, then\r\n\r\nStem correction = 0.000085 × 200 × (400 - 85) = 5.3 degrees.\r\n\r\nAs the stem is at a lower temperature than the bulb, the thermometer\r\nwill evidently read too low, so that this correction must be added to\r\nthe observed reading to find the reading corresponding to total\r\nimmersion. The corrected reading will therefore be 405.3 degrees. If\r\nthis thermometer is to be corrected in accordance with the calibrated\r\ncorrections given above, we note that a further correction of 0.5 must\r\nbe applied to the observed reading at this temperature, so that the\r\ncorrect temperature is 405.3 - 0.5 = 404.8 degrees or 405 degrees.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 12]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 13]\r\n\r\nFig. 12 shows how a stem correction can be obtained for the case just\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\nFig. 13 affords an opportunity for comparing the scale of a thermometer\r\ncorrect for total immersion with one which will read correctly when\r\nsubmerged to the 300 degrees mark, the stem being exposed at a mean\r\ntemperature of 110 degrees Fahrenheit, a temperature often prevailing\r\nwhen thermometers are used for measuring temperatures in steam mains.\r\n\r\nAbsolute Zero--Experiments show that at 32 degrees Fahrenheit a perfect\r\ngas expands 1/491.64 part of its volume if its pressure remains constant\r\nand its temperature is increased one degree. Thus if gas at 32 degrees\r\nFahrenheit occupies 100 cubic feet and its temperature is increased one\r\ndegree, its volume will be increased to 100 + 100/491.64 = 100.203 cubic\r\nfeet. For a rise of two degrees the volume would be 100 + (100 × 2) /\r\n491.64 = 100.406 cubic feet. If this rate of expansion per one degree\r\nheld good at all temperatures, and experiment shows that it does above\r\nthe freezing point, the gas, if its pressure remained the same, would\r\ndouble its volume, if raised to a temperature of 32 + 491.64 = 523.64\r\ndegrees Fahrenheit, while under a diminution of temperature it would\r\nshrink and finally disappear at a temperature of 491.64 - 32 = 459.64\r\ndegrees below zero Fahrenheit. While undoubtedly some change in the law\r\nwould take place before the lower temperature could be reached, there is\r\nno reason why the law may not be used within the range of temperature\r\nwhere it is known to hold good. From this explanation it is evident that\r\nunder a constant pressure the volume of a gas will vary as the number of\r\ndegrees between its temperature and the temperature of -459.64 degrees\r\nFahrenheit. To simplify the application of the law, a new thermometric\r\nscale is constructed as follows: the point corresponding to -460 degrees\r\nFahrenheit, is taken as the zero point on the new scale, and the degrees\r\nare identical in magnitude with those on the Fahrenheit scale.\r\nTemperatures referred to this new scale are called absolute temperatures\r\nand the point -460 degrees Fahrenheit (= -273 degrees centigrade) is\r\ncalled the absolute zero. To convert any temperature Fahrenheit to\r\nabsolute temperature, add 460 degrees to the temperature on the\r\nFahrenheit scale: thus 54 degrees Fahrenheit will be 54 + 460 = 514\r\ndegrees absolute temperature; 113 degrees Fahrenheit will likewise be\r\nequal to 113 + 460 = 573 degrees absolute temperature. If one pound of\r\ngas is at a temperature of 54 degrees Fahrenheit and another pound is at\r\na temperature of 114 degrees Fahrenheit the respective volumes at a\r\ngiven pressure would be in the ratio of 514 to 573.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ninety-sixth Street Station of the New York Railways Co.,\r\nNew York City, Operating 20,000 Horse Power of Babcock & Wilcox Boilers.\r\nThis Company and its Allied Companies Operate a Total of 100,000 Horse\r\nPower of Babcock & Wilcox Boilers]\r\n\r\nBritish Thermal Unit--The quantitative measure of heat is the British\r\nthermal unit, ordinarily written B. t. u. This is the quantity of heat\r\nrequired to raise the temperature of one pound of pure water one degree\r\nat 62 degrees Fahrenheit; that is, from 62 degrees to 63 degrees. In the\r\nmetric system this unit is the _calorie_ and is the heat necessary\r\nto raise the temperature of one kilogram of pure water from 15 degrees\r\nto 16 degrees centigrade. These two definitions lead to a discrepancy of\r\n0.03 of 1 per cent, which is insignificant for engineering purposes, and\r\nin the following the B. t. u. is taken with this discrepancy ignored.\r\nThe discrepancy is due to the fact that there is a slight difference in\r\nthe specific heat of water at 15 degrees centigrade and 62 degrees\r\nFahrenheit. The two units may be compared thus:\r\n\r\n1 Calorie = 3.968 B. t. u.       1 B. t. u. = 0.252 Calories.\r\n\r\n_Unit_       _Water_      _Temperature Rise_\r\n1 B. t. u.   1 Pound      1 Degree Fahrenheit\r\n1 Calorie    1 Kilogram   1 Degree centigrade\r\n\r\nBut 1 kilogram = 2.2046 pounds and 1 degree centigrade = 9/5 degree\r\nFahrenheit.\r\n\r\nHence 1 calorie = (2.2046 × 9/5) = 3.968 B. t. u.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe heat values in B. t. u. are ordinarily given per pound, and the heat\r\nvalues in calories per kilogram, in which case the B. t. u. per pound\r\nare approximately equivalent to 9/5 the calories per kilogram.\r\n\r\nAs determined by Joule, heat energy has a certain definite relation to\r\nwork, one British thermal unit being equivalent from his determinations\r\nto 772 foot pounds. Rowland, a later investigator, found that 778 foot\r\npounds were a more exact equivalent. Still later investigations indicate\r\nthat the correct value for a B. t. u. is 777.52 foot pounds or\r\napproximately 778. The relation of heat energy to work as determined is\r\na demonstration of the first law of thermo-dynamics, namely, that heat\r\nand mechanical energy are mutually convertible in the ratio of 778 foot\r\npounds for one British thermal unit. This law, algebraically expressed,\r\nis W = JH; W being the work done in foot pounds, H being the heat in\r\nB. t. u., and J being Joules equivalent. Thus 1000 B. t. u.'s would be\r\ncapable of doing 1000 × 778 = 778000 foot pounds of work.\r\n\r\nSpecific Heat--The specific heat of a substance is the quantity of heat\r\nexpressed in thermal units required to raise or lower the temperature of\r\na unit weight of any substance at a given temperature one degree. This\r\nquantity will vary for different substances For example, it requires\r\nabout 16 B. t. u. to raise the temperature of one pound of ice 32\r\ndegrees or 0.5 B. t. u. to raise it one degree, while it requires\r\napproximately 180 B. t. u. to raise the temperature of one pound of\r\nwater 180 degrees or one B. t. u. for one degree.\r\n\r\nIf then, a pound of water be considered as a standard, the ratio of the\r\namount of heat required to raise a similar unit of any other substance\r\none degree, to the amount required to raise a pound of water one degree\r\nis known as the specific heat of that substance. Thus since one pound of\r\nwater required one B. t. u. to raise its temperature one degree, and one\r\npound of ice requires about 0.5 degrees to raise its temperature one\r\ndegree, the ratio is 0.5 which is the specific heat of ice. To be exact,\r\nthe specific heat of ice is 0.504, hence 32 degrees × 0.504 = 16.128\r\nB. t. u. would be required to raise the temperature of one pound of ice\r\nfrom 0 to 32 degrees. For solids, at ordinary temperatures, the specific\r\nheat may be considered a constant for each individual substance,\r\nalthough it is variable for high temperatures. In the case of gases a\r\ndistinction must be made between specific heat at constant volume, and\r\nat constant pressure.\r\n\r\nWhere specific heat is stated alone, specific heat at ordinary\r\ntemperature is implied, and _mean_ specific heat refers to the average\r\nvalue of this quantity between the temperatures named.\r\n\r\nThe specific heat of a mixture of gases is obtained by multiplying the\r\nspecific heat of each constituent gas by the percentage by weight of\r\nthat gas in the mixture, and dividing the sum of the products by 100.\r\nThe specific heat of a gas whose composition by weight is CO_{2}, 13 per\r\ncent; CO, 0.4 per cent; O, 8 per cent; N, 78.6 per cent, is found as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nCO_{2} :   13 × 0.217  =  2.821\r\nCO     :  0.4 × 0.2479 =  0.09916\r\nO      :    8 × 0.2175 =  1.74000\r\nN      : 78.6 × 0.2438 = 19.16268\r\n                         --------\r\n        100.0            23.82284\r\n\r\nand 23.8228 ÷ 100 = 0.238 = specific heat of the gas.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe specific heats of various solids, liquids and gases are given in\r\nTable 4.\r\n\r\nSensible Heat--The heat utilized in raising the temperature of a body,\r\nas that in raising the temperature of water from 32 degrees up to the\r\nboiling point, is termed sensible heat. In the case of water, the\r\nsensible heat required to raise its temperature from the freezing point\r\nto the boiling point corresponding to the pressure under which\r\nebullition occurs, is termed the heat of the liquid.\r\n\r\nLatent Heat--Latent heat is the heat which apparently disappears in\r\nproducing some change in the condition of a body without increasing its\r\ntemperature If heat be added to ice at freezing temperature, the ice\r\nwill melt but its temperature will not be raised. The heat so utilized\r\nin changing the condition of the ice is the latent heat and in this\r\nparticular case is known as the latent heat of fusion. If heat be added\r\nto water at 212 degrees under atmospheric pressure, the water will not\r\nbecome hotter but will be evaporated into steam, the temperature of\r\nwhich will also be 212 degrees. The heat so utilized is called the\r\nlatent heat of evaporation and is the heat which apparently disappears\r\nin causing the substance to pass from a liquid to a gaseous state.\r\n\r\n                                TABLE 4\r\n\r\n                 SPECIFIC HEATS OF VARIOUS SUBSTANCES\r\n+--------------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n|                               SOLIDS                               |\r\n+-------------------------------+----------------+-------------------+\r\n|                               |  Temperature[2]|                   |\r\n|                               |    Degrees     |     Specific      |\r\n|                               |   Fahrenheit   |       Heat        |\r\n+-------------------------------+----------------+-------------------+\r\n| Copper                        |     59-460     |       .0951       |\r\n| Gold                          |     32-212     |       .0316       |\r\n| Wrought Iron                  |     59-212     |       .1152       |\r\n| Cast Iron                     |     68-212     |       .1189       |\r\n| Steel (soft)                  |     68-208     |       .1175       |\r\n| Steel (hard)                  |     68-208     |       .1165       |\r\n| Zinc                          |     32-212     |       .0935       |\r\n| Brass (yellow)                |     32         |       .0883       |\r\n| Glass (normal ther. 16^{III}) |     66-212     |       .1988       |\r\n| Lead                          |     59         |       .0299       |\r\n| Platinum                      |     32-212     |       .0323       |\r\n| Silver                        |     32-212     |       .0559       |\r\n| Tin                           |   -105-64      |       .0518       |\r\n| Ice                           |                |       .5040       |\r\n| Sulphur (newly fused)         |                |       .2025       |\r\n+-------------------------------+----------------+-------------------+\r\n|                               LIQUIDS                              |\r\n+-------------------------------+----------------+-------------------+\r\n|                               |  Temperature[2]|                   |\r\n|                               |    Degrees     |    Specific       |\r\n|                               |   Fahrenheit   |      Heat         |\r\n+-------------------------------+----------------+-------------------+\r\n| Water[3]                      |     59         |      1.0000       |\r\n| Alcohol                       |     32         |       .5475       |\r\n|                               |    176         |       .7694       |\r\n| Mercury                       |     32         |       .03346      |\r\n| Benzol                        |     50         |       .4066       |\r\n|                               |    122         |       .4502       |\r\n| Glycerine                     |     59-102     |       .576        |\r\n| Lead (Melted)                 | to 360         |       .0410       |\r\n| Sulphur (melted)              |    246-297     |       .2350       |\r\n| Tin (melted)                  |                |       .0637       |\r\n| Sea Water (sp. gr. 1.0043)    |     64         |       .980        |\r\n| Sea Water (sp. gr. 1.0463)    |     64         |       .903        |\r\n| Oil of Turpentine             |     32         |       .411        |\r\n| Petroleum                     |     64-210     |       .498        |\r\n| Sulphuric Acid                |     68-133     |       .3363       |\r\n+-------------------------------+----------------+-------------------+\r\n|                                GASES                               |\r\n+--------------------------+---------------+--------------+----------+\r\n|                          |               |   Specific   | Specific |\r\n|                          | Temperature[2]|   Heat at    | Heat at  |\r\n|                          |   Degrees     |   Constant   | Constant |\r\n|                          |  Fahrenheit   |   Pressure   |  Volume  |\r\n+--------------------------+---------------+--------------+----------+\r\n| Air                      |    32-392     |     .2375    |   .1693  |\r\n| Oxygen                   |    44-405     |     .2175    |   .1553  |\r\n| Nitrogen                 |    32-392     |     .2438    |   .1729  |\r\n| Hydrogen                 |    54-388     |    3.4090    |  2.4141  |\r\n| Superheated Steam        |               | See table 25 |          |\r\n| Carbon Monoxide          |    41-208     |     .2425    |   .1728  |\r\n| Carbon Dioxide           |    52-417     |     .2169    |   .1535  |\r\n| Methane                  |    64-406     |     .5929    |   .4505  |\r\n| Blast Fur.

It may, therefore, be defined as stated, as the heat\r\nwhich apparently disappears, or is lost to thermometric measurement,\r\nwhen the molecular constitution of a body is being changed. Latent heat\r\nis expended in performing the work of overcoming the molecular cohesion\r\nof the particles of the substance and in overcoming the resistance of\r\nexternal pressure to change of volume of the heated body. Latent heat of\r\nevaporation, therefore, may be said to consist of internal and external\r\nheat, the former being utilized in overcoming the molecular resistance\r\nof the water in changing to steam, while the latter is expended in\r\novercoming any resistance to the increase of its volume during\r\nformation. In evaporating a pound of water at 212 degrees to steam at\r\n212 degrees, 897.6 B. t. u. are expended as internal latent heat and\r\n72.8 B. t. u. as external latent heat. For a more detailed description\r\nof the changes brought about in water by sensible and latent heat, the\r\nreader is again referred to the chapter on \"The Theory of Steam Making\".\r\n\r\nEbullition--The temperature of ebullition of any liquid, or its boiling\r\npoint, may be defined as the temperature which exists where the addition\r\nof heat to the liquid no longer increases its temperature, the heat\r\nadded being absorbed or utilized in converting the liquid into vapor.\r\nThis temperature is dependent upon the pressure under which the liquid\r\nis evaporated, being higher as the pressure is greater.\r\n\r\n               TABLE 5\r\n\r\nBOILING POINTS AT ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE\r\n\r\n+---------------------+--------------+\r\n|                     |   Degrees    |\r\n|                     |  Fahrenheit  |\r\n+---------------------+--------------+\r\n|  Ammonia            |     140      |\r\n|  Bromine            |     145      |\r\n|  Alcohol            |     173      |\r\n|  Benzine            |     212      |\r\n|  Water              |     212      |\r\n|  Average Sea Water  |     213.2    |\r\n|  Saturated Brine    |     226      |\r\n|  Mercury            |     680      |\r\n+---------------------+--------------+\r\n\r\nTotal Heat of Evaporation--The quantity of heat required to raise a unit\r\nof any liquid from the freezing point to any given temperature, and to\r\nentirely evaporate it at that temperature, is the total heat of\r\nevaporation of the liquid for that temperature. It is the sum of the\r\nheat of the liquid and the latent heat of evaporation.\r\n\r\nTo recapitulate, the heat added to a body is divided as follows:\r\n\r\nTotal heat = Heat to change the temperature + heat to overcome the\r\n             molecular cohesion + heat to overcome the external pressure\r\n             resisting an increase of volume of the body.\r\n\r\nWhere water is converted into steam, this total heat is divided as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nTotal heat = Heat to change the temperature of the water + heat to\r\n             separate the molecules of the water + heat to overcome\r\n             resistance to increase in volume of the steam,\r\n           = Heat of the liquid + internal latent heat + external\r\n             latent heat,\r\n           = Heat of the liquid + total latent heat of steam,\r\n           = Total heat of evaporation.\r\n\r\nThe steam tables given on pages 122 to 127 give the heat of the liquid\r\nand the total latent heat through a wide range of temperatures.\r\n\r\nGases--When heat is added to gases there is no internal work done; hence\r\nthe total heat is that required to change the temperature plus that\r\nrequired to do the external work. If the gas is not allowed to expand\r\nbut is preserved at constant volume, the entire heat added is that\r\nrequired to change the temperature only.\r\n\r\nLinear Expansion of Substances by Heat--To find the increase in the\r\nlength of a bar of any material due to an increase of temperature,\r\nmultiply the number of degrees of increase in temperature by the\r\ncoefficient of expansion for one degree and by the length of the bar.\r\nWhere the coefficient of expansion is given for 100 degrees, as in Table\r\n6, the result should be divided by 100. The expansion of metals per one\r\ndegree rise of temperature increases slightly as high temperatures are\r\nreached, but for all practical purposes it may be assumed to be constant\r\nfor a given metal.\r\n\r\n                               TABLE 6\r\n\r\n         LINEAL EXPANSION OF SOLIDS AT ORDINARY TEMPERATURES\r\n\r\n (Tabular values represent increase per foot per 100 degrees increase\r\n              in temperature, Fahrenheit or centigrade)\r\n\r\n+-------------------+--------------+----------------+----------------+\r\n|                   | Temperature  |                |                |\r\n|                   | Conditions[4]|Coefficient per |Coefficient per |\r\n|   Substance       | Degrees      | 100 Degrees    | 100 Degrees    |\r\n|                   | Fahrenheit   | Fahrenheit     | Centigrade     |\r\n+-------------------+--------------+----------------+----------------+\r\n|Brass (cast)       |  32 to 212   |    .001042     |    .001875     |\r\n|Brass (wire)       |  32 to 212   |    .001072     |    .001930     |\r\n|Copper             |  32 to 212   |    .000926     |    .001666     |\r\n|Glass (English     |              |                |                |\r\n|flint)             |  32 to 212   |    .000451     |    .000812     |\r\n|Glass (French      |              |                |                |\r\n|flint)             |  32 to 212   |    .000484     |    .000872     |\r\n|Gold               |  32 to 212   |    .000816     |    .001470     |\r\n|Granite (average)  |  32 to 212   |    .000482     |    .000868     |\r\n|Iron (cast)        |     104      |    .000589     |    .001061     |\r\n|Iron (soft forged) |  0 to 212    |    .000634     |    .001141     |\r\n|Iron (wire)        |  32 to 212   |    .000800     |    .001440     |\r\n|Lead               |  32 to 212   |    .001505     |    .002709     |\r\n|Mercury            |  32 to 212   |    .009984[5]  |    .017971     |\r\n|Platinum           |     104      |    .000499     |    .000899     |\r\n|Limestone          |  32 to 212   |    .000139     |    .000251     |\r\n|Silver             |     104      |    .001067     |    .001921     |\r\n|Steel (Bessemer    |              |                |                |\r\n|rolled, hard)      |  0 to 212    |    .00056      |    .00101      |\r\n|Steel (Bessemer    |              |                |                |\r\n|rolled, soft)      |  0 to 212    |    .00063      |    .00117      |\r\n|Steel (cast,       |              |                |                |\r\n|French)            |     104      |    .000734     |    .001322     |\r\n|Steel (cast        |              |                |                |\r\n|annealed, English) |     104      |    .000608     |    .001095     |\r\n+-------------------+--------------+----------------+----------------+\r\n\r\nHigh Temperature Measurements--The temperatures to be dealt with in\r\nsteam-boiler practice range from those of ordinary air and steam to the\r\ntemperatures of burning fuel. The gases of combustion, originally at the\r\ntemperature of the furnace, cool as they pass through each successive\r\nbank of tubes in the boiler, to nearly the temperature of the steam,\r\nresulting in a wide range of temperatures through which definite\r\nmeasurements are sometimes required.\r\n\r\nOf the different methods devised for ascertaining these temperatures,\r\nsome of the most important are as follows:\r\n\r\n    1st. Mercurial pyrometers for temperatures up to 1000 degrees\r\n    Fahrenheit.\r\n\r\n    2nd. Expansion pyrometers for temperatures up to 1500 degrees\r\n    Fahrenheit.\r\n\r\n    3rd. Calorimetry for temperatures up to 2000 degrees Fahrenheit.\r\n\r\n    4th. Thermo-electric pyrometers for temperatures up to 2900\r\n    degrees Fahrenheit.\r\n\r\n    5th. Melting points of metal which flow at various temperatures\r\n    up to the melting point of platinum 3227 degrees Fahrenheit.\r\n\r\n    6th. Radiation pyrometers for temperatures up to 3600 degrees\r\n    Fahrenheit.\r\n\r\n    7th. Optical pyrometers capable of measuring temperatures up to\r\n    12,600 degrees Fahrenheit.[6] For ordinary boiler practice\r\n    however, their range is 1600 to 3600 degrees Fahrenheit.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 228 Horse-power Babcock & Wilcox Boiler, Installed at the\r\nWentworth Institute, Boston, Mass.]\r\n\r\nTable 7 gives the degree of accuracy of high temperature measurements.\r\n\r\n                     TABLE 7\r\n\r\n   ACCURACY OF HIGH TEMPERATURE MEASUREMENTS[7]\r\n\r\n+------------------------+------------------------+\r\n|       Centigrade       |       Fahrenheit       |\r\n+-------------+----------+-------------+----------+\r\n|             | Accuracy |             | Accuracy |\r\n| Temperature | Plus or  | Temperature | Plus or  |\r\n|   Range     | Minus    |   Range     | Minus    |\r\n|             | Degrees  |             | Degrees  |\r\n+-------------+----------+-------------+----------+\r\n|   200- 500  |    0.5   |   392- 932  |    0.9   |\r\n|   500- 800  |    2     |   932-1472  |    3.6   |\r\n|   800-1100  |    3     |  1472-2012  |    5.4   |\r\n|  1100-1600  |   15     |  2012-2912  |   27     |\r\n|  1600-2000  |   25     |  2912-3632  |   45     |\r\n+-------------+----------+-------------+----------+\r\n\r\n\r\nMercurial Pyrometers--At atmospheric pressure mercury boils at 676\r\ndegrees Fahrenheit and even at lower temperatures the mercury in\r\nthermometers will be distilled and will collect in the upper part of the\r\nstem. Therefore, for temperatures much above 400 degrees Fahrenheit,\r\nsome inert gas, such as nitrogen or carbon dioxide, must be forced under\r\npressure into the upper part of the thermometer stem. The pressure at\r\n600 degrees Fahrenheit is about 15 pounds, or slightly above that of the\r\natmosphere, at 850 degrees about 70 pounds, and at 1000 degrees about\r\n300 pounds.\r\n\r\nFlue-gas temperatures are nearly always taken with mercurial\r\nthermometers as they are the most accurate and are easy to read and\r\nmanipulate. Care must be taken that the bulb of the instrument projects\r\ninto the path of the moving gases in order that the temperature may\r\ntruly represent the flue gas temperature. No readings should be\r\nconsidered until the thermometer has been in place long enough to heat\r\nit up to the full temperature of the gases.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpansion Pyrometers--Brass expands about 50 per cent more than iron and\r\nin both brass and iron the expansion is nearly proportional to the\r\nincrease in temperature. This phenomenon is utilized in expansion\r\npyrometers by enclosing a brass rod in an iron pipe, one end of the rod\r\nbeing rigidly attached to a cap at the end of the pipe, while the other\r\nis connected by a multiplying gear to a pointer moving around a\r\ngraduated dial. The whole length of the expansion piece must be at a\r\nuniform temperature before a correct reading can be obtained. This fact,\r\ntogether with the lost motion which is likely to exist in the mechanism\r\nconnected to the pointer, makes the expansion pyrometer unreliable; it\r\nshould be used only when its limitations are thoroughly understood and\r\nit should be carefully calibrated. Unless the brass and iron are known\r\nto be of the same temperature, its action will be anomalous: for\r\ninstance, if it be allowed to cool after being exposed to a high\r\ntemperature, the needle will rise before it begins to fall. Similarly, a\r\nrise in temperature is first shown by the instrument as a fall. The\r\nexplanation is that the iron, being on the outside, heats or cools more\r\nquickly than the brass.\r\n\r\n\r\nCalorimetry--This method derives its name from the fact that the process\r\nis the same as the determination of the specific heat of a substance by\r\nthe water calorimeter, except that in one case the temperature is known\r\nand the specific heat is required, while in the other the specific heat\r\nis known and the temperature is required. The temperature is found as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nA given weight of some substance such as iron, nickel or fire brick, is\r\nheated to the unknown temperature and then plunged into water and the\r\nrise in temperature noted.\r\n\r\nIf X = temperature to be measured, w = weight of heated body in pounds,\r\nW = weight of water in pounds, T = final temperature of water, t =\r\ndifference between initial and final temperatures of water, s = known\r\nspecific heat of body. Then X = T + Wt ÷ ws\r\n\r\nAny temperatures secured by this method are affected by so many sources\r\nof error that the results are very approximate.\r\n\r\nThermo-electric Pyrometers--When wires of two different metals are\r\njoined at one end and heated, an electromotive force will be set up\r\nbetween the free ends of the wires. Its amount will depend upon the\r\ncomposition of the wires and the difference in temperature between the\r\ntwo. If a delicate galvanometer of high resistance be connected to the\r\n\"thermal couple\", as it is called, the deflection of the needle, after a\r\ncareful calibration, will indicate the temperature very accurately.\r\n\r\nIn the thermo-electric pyrometer of Le Chatelier, the wires used are\r\nplatinum and a 10 per cent alloy of platinum and rhodium, enclosed in\r\nporcelain tubes to protect them from the oxidizing influence of the\r\nfurnace gases. The couple with its protecting tubes is called an\r\n\"element\". The elements are made in different lengths to suit\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary for accuracy to expose the whole length of the\r\nelement to the temperature to be measured, as the electromotive force\r\ndepends only upon the temperature of the juncture at the closed end of\r\nthe protecting tube and that of the cold end of the element. The\r\ngalvanometer can be located at any convenient point, since the length of\r\nthe wires leading to it simply alter the resistance of the circuit, for\r\nwhich allowance may be made.\r\n\r\nThe advantages of the thermo-electric pyrometer are accuracy over a wide\r\nrange of temperatures, continuity of readings, and the ease with which\r\nobservations can be taken. Its disadvantages are high first cost and, in\r\nsome cases, extreme delicacy.\r\n\r\nMelting Points of Metals--The approximate temperature of a furnace or\r\nflue may be determined, if so desired, by introducing certain metals of\r\nwhich the melting points are known. The more common metals form a series\r\nin which the respective melting points differ by 100 to 200 degrees\r\nFahrenheit, and by using these in order, the temperature can be fixed\r\nbetween the melting points of some two of them. This method lacks\r\naccuracy, but it suffices for determinations where approximate readings\r\nare satisfactory.\r\n\r\nThe approximate melting points of certain metals that may be used for\r\ndeterminations of this nature are given in Table 8.\r\n\r\nRadiation Pyrometers--These are similar to thermo-electric pyrometers in\r\nthat a thermo-couple is employed. The heat rays given out by the hot\r\nbody fall on a concave mirror and are brought to a focus at a point at\r\nwhich is placed the junction of a thermo-couple. The temperature\r\nreadings are obtained from an indicator similar to that used with\r\nthermo-electric pyrometers.\r\n\r\nOptical Pyrometers--Of the optical pyrometers the Wanner is perhaps the\r\nmost reliable. The principle on which this instrument is constructed is\r\nthat of comparing the quantity of light emanating from the heated body\r\nwith a constant source of light, in this case a two-volt osmium lamp.\r\nThe lamp is placed at one end of an optical tube, while at the other an\r\neyepiece is provided and a scale. A battery of cells furnishes the\r\ncurrent for the lamp. On looking through the pyrometer, a circle of red\r\nlight appears, divided into distinct halves of different intensities.\r\nAdjustment may be made so that the two halves appear alike and a reading\r\nis then taken from the scale. The temperatures are obtained from a table\r\nof temperatures corresponding to scale readings. For standardizing the\r\nosmium lamp, an amylacetate lamp, is provided with a stand for holding\r\nthe optical tube.\r\n\r\n                TABLE 8\r\n\r\nAPPROXIMATE MELTING POINTS OF METALS[8]\r\n\r\n+-----------------+------------------+\r\n|    Metal        |    Temperature   |\r\n|                 |Degrees Fahrenheit|\r\n+-----------------+------------------+\r\n|Wrought Iron     |       2737       |\r\n|Pig Iron (gray)  |     2190-2327    |\r\n|Cast Iron (white)|       2075       |\r\n|Steel            |     2460-2550    |\r\n|Steel (cast)     |       2500       |\r\n|Copper           |       1981       |\r\n|Zinc             |        786       |\r\n|Antimony         |       1166       |\r\n|Lead             |        621       |\r\n|Bismuth          |        498       |\r\n|Tin              |        449       |\r\n|Platinum         |       3191       |\r\n|Gold             |       1946       |\r\n|Silver           |       1762       |\r\n|Aluminum         |       1216       |\r\n+-----------------+------------------+\r\n\r\n\r\nDetermination of Temperature from Character of Emitted Light--As a\r\nfurther means of determining approximately the temperature of a furnace,\r\nTable 9, compiled by Messrs.

Babcock, at Cornell\r\nUniversity, 1887[10]]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe chemical compound known as H_{2}O exists in three states or\r\nconditions--ice, water and steam; the only difference between these\r\nstates or conditions is in the presence or absence of a quantity of\r\nenergy exhibited partly in the form of heat and partly in molecular\r\nactivity, which, for want of a better name, we are accustomed to call\r\n\"latent heat\"; and to transform it from one state to another we have\r\nonly to supply or extract heat. For instance, if we take a quantity of\r\nice, say one pound, at absolute zero[11] and supply heat, the first\r\neffect is to raise its temperature until it arrives at a point 492\r\nFahrenheit degrees above the starting point. Here it stops growing\r\nwarmer, though we keep on adding heat. It, however, changes from ice to\r\nwater, and when we have added sufficient heat to have made it, had it\r\nremained ice, 283 degrees hotter or a temperature of 315 degrees\r\nFahrenheit's thermometer, it has all become water, at the same\r\ntemperature at which it commenced to change, namely, 492 degrees above\r\nabsolute zero, or 32 degrees by Fahrenheit's scale. Let us still\r\ncontinue to add heat, and it will now grow warmer again, though at a\r\nslower rate--that is, it now takes about double the quantity of heat to\r\nraise the pound one degree that it did before--until it reaches a\r\ntemperature of 212 degrees Fahrenheit, or 672 degrees absolute (assuming\r\nthat we are at the level of the sea). Here we find another critical\r\npoint. However much more heat we may apply, the water, as water, at that\r\npressure, cannot be heated any hotter, but changes on the addition of\r\nheat to steam; and it is not until we have added heat enough to have\r\nraised the temperature of the water 966 degrees, or to 1,178 degrees by\r\nFahrenheit's thermometer (presuming for the moment that its specific\r\nheat has not changed since it became water), that it has all become\r\nsteam, which steam, nevertheless, is at the temperature of 212 degrees,\r\nat which the water began to change. Thus over four-fifths of the heat\r\nwhich has been added to the water has disappeared, or become insensible\r\nin the steam to any of our instruments.\r\n\r\nIt follows that if we could reduce steam at atmospheric pressure to\r\nwater, without loss of heat, the heat stored within it would cause the\r\nwater to be red hot; and if we could further change it to a solid, like\r\nice, without loss of heat, the solid would be white hot, or hotter than\r\nmelted steel--it being assumed, of course, that the specific heat of the\r\nwater and ice remain normal, or the same as they respectively are at the\r\nfreezing point.\r\n\r\nAfter steam has been formed, a further addition of heat increases the\r\ntemperature again at a much faster ratio to the quantity of heat added,\r\nwhich ratio also varies according as we maintain a constant pressure or\r\na constant volume; and I am not aware that any other critical point\r\nexists where this will cease to be the fact until we arrive at that very\r\nhigh temperature, known as the point of dissociation, at which it\r\nbecomes resolved into its original gases.\r\n\r\nThe heat which has been absorbed by one pound of water to convert it\r\ninto a pound of steam at atmospheric pressure is sufficient to have\r\nmelted 3 pounds of steel or 13 pounds of gold. This has been transformed\r\ninto something besides heat; stored up to reappear as heat when the\r\nprocess is reversed. That condition is what we are pleased to call\r\nlatent heat, and in it resides mainly the ability of the steam to do\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n[Graph: Temperature in Fahrenheit Degrees (from Absolute Zero)\r\nagainst Quantity of Heat in British Thermal Units]\r\n\r\nThe diagram shows graphically the relation of heat to temperature, the\r\nhorizontal scale being quantity of heat in British thermal units, and\r\nthe vertical temperature in Fahrenheit degrees, both reckoned from\r\nabsolute zero and by the usual scale. The dotted lines for ice and water\r\nshow the temperature which would have been obtained if the conditions\r\nhad not changed. The lines marked \"gold\" and \"steel\" show the relation\r\nto heat and temperature and the melting points of these metals. All the\r\ninclined lines would be slightly curved if attention had been paid to\r\nthe changing specific heat, but the curvature would be small. It is\r\nworth noting that, with one or two exceptions, the curves of all\r\nsubstances lie between the vertical and that for water. That is to say,\r\nthat water has a greater capacity for heat than all other substances\r\nexcept two, hydrogen and bromine.\r\n\r\nIn order to generate steam, then, only two steps are required: 1st,\r\nprocure the heat, and 2nd, transfer it to the water. Now, you have it\r\nlaid down as an axiom that when a body has been transferred or\r\ntransformed from one place or state into another, the same work has been\r\ndone and the same energy expended, whatever may have been the\r\nintermediate steps or conditions, or whatever the apparatus. Therefore,\r\nwhen a given quantity of water at a given temperature has been made into\r\nsteam at a given temperature, a certain definite work has been done, and\r\na certain amount of energy expended, from whatever the heat may have\r\nbeen obtained, or whatever boiler may have been employed for the\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nA pound of coal or any other fuel has a definite heat producing\r\ncapacity, and is capable of evaporating a definite quantity of water\r\nunder given conditions. That is the limit beyond which even perfection\r\ncannot go, and yet I have known, and doubtless you have heard of, cases\r\nwhere inventors have claimed, and so-called engineers have certified to,\r\nmuch higher results.\r\n\r\nThe first step in generating steam is in burning the fuel to the best\r\nadvantage. A pound of carbon will generate 14,500 British thermal units,\r\nduring combustion into carbonic dioxide, and this will be the same,\r\nwhatever the temperature or the rapidity at which the combustion may\r\ntake place. If possible, we might oxidize it at as slow a rate as that\r\nwith which iron rusts or wood rots in the open air, or we might burn it\r\nwith the rapidity of gunpowder, a ton in a second, yet the total heat\r\ngenerated would be precisely the same. Again, we may keep the\r\ntemperature down to the lowest point at which combustion can take place,\r\nby bringing large bodies of air in contact with it, or otherwise, or we\r\nmay supply it with just the right quantity of pure oxygen, and burn it\r\nat a temperature approaching that of dissociation, and still the heat\r\nunits given off will be neither more nor less. It follows, therefore,\r\nthat great latitude in the manner or rapidity of combustion may be taken\r\nwithout affecting the quantity of heat generated.\r\n\r\nBut in practice it is found that other considerations limit this\r\nlatitude, and that there are certain conditions necessary in order to\r\nget the most available heat from a pound of coal. There are three ways,\r\nand only three, in which the heat developed by the combustion of coal in\r\na steam boiler furnace may be expended.\r\n\r\n1st, and principally. It should be conveyed to the water in the boiler,\r\nand be utilized in the production of steam. To be perfect, a boiler\r\nshould so utilize all the heat of combustion, but there are no perfect\r\nboilers.\r\n\r\n2nd. A portion of the heat of combustion is conveyed up the chimney in\r\nthe waste gases. This is in proportion to the weight of the gases, and\r\nthe difference between their temperature and that of the air and coal\r\nbefore they entered the fire.\r\n\r\n3rd. Another portion is dissipated by radiation from the sides of the\r\nfurnace. In a stove the heat is all used in these latter two ways,\r\neither it goes off through the chimney or is radiated into the\r\nsurrounding space. It is one of the principal problems of boiler\r\nengineering to render the amount of heat thus lost as small as possible.\r\n\r\nThe loss from radiation is in proportion to the amount of surface, its\r\nnature, its temperature, and the time it is exposed. This loss can be\r\nalmost entirely eliminated by thick walls and a smooth white or polished\r\nsurface, but its amount is ordinarily so small that these extraordinary\r\nprecautions do not pay in practice.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that the temperature of the escaping gases cannot be\r\nbrought below that of the absorbing surfaces, while it may be much\r\ngreater even to that of the fire. This is supposing that all of the\r\nescaping gases have passed through the fire. In case air is allowed to\r\nleak into the flues, and mingle with the gases after they have left the\r\nheating surfaces, the temperature may be brought down to almost any\r\npoint above that of the atmosphere, but without any reduction in the\r\namount of heat wasted. It is in this way that those low chimney\r\ntemperatures are sometimes attained which pass for proof of economy with\r\nthe unobserving. All surplus air admitted to the fire, or to the gases\r\nbefore they leave the heating surfaces, increases the losses.\r\n\r\nWe are now prepared to see why and how the temperature and the rapidity\r\nof combustion in the boiler furnace affect the economy, and that though\r\nthe amount of heat developed may be the same, the heat available for the\r\ngeneration of steam may be much less with one rate or temperature of\r\ncombustion than another.\r\n\r\nAssuming that there is no air passing up the chimney other than that\r\nwhich has passed through the fire, the higher the temperature of the\r\nfire and the lower that of the escaping gases the better the economy,\r\nfor the losses by the chimney gases will bear the same proportion to the\r\nheat generated by the combustion as the temperature of those gases bears\r\nto the temperature of the fire. That is to say, if the temperature of\r\nthe fire is 2500 degrees and that of the chimney gases 500 degrees above\r\nthat of the atmosphere, the loss by the chimney will be 500/2500 = 20\r\nper cent. Therefore, as the escaping gases cannot be brought below the\r\ntemperature of the absorbing surface, which is practically a fixed\r\nquantity, the temperature of the fire must be high in order to secure\r\ngood economy.\r\n\r\nThe losses by radiation being practically proportioned to the time\r\noccupied, the more coal burned in a given furnace in a given time, the\r\nless will be the proportionate loss from that cause.\r\n\r\nIt therefore follows that we should burn our coal rapidly and at a high\r\ntemperature to secure the best available economy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Portion of 9880 Horse-power Installation of Babcock &\r\nWilcox Boilers and Superheaters, Equipped with Babcock & Wilcox Chain\r\nGrate Stokers at the South Side Elevated Ry.

If water is weighed in air in the\r\nordinary way, there is a correction of about one-eighth of one per cent\r\nwhich is usually negligible.\r\n\r\n                TABLE 11\r\n\r\nVOLUME AND WEIGHT OF DISTILLED WATER AT\r\n        VARIOUS TEMPERATURES[12]\r\n\r\n+-----------+---------------+----------+\r\n|Temperature|Relative Volume|Weight per|\r\n|  Degrees  | Water at 39.2 |Cubic Foot|\r\n| Fahrenheit|  Degrees = 1  |  Pounds  |\r\n+-----------+---------------+----------+\r\n|    32     |   1.000176    |  62.42   |\r\n|    39.2   |   1.000000    |  62.43   |\r\n|    40     |   1.000004    |  62.43   |\r\n|    50     |   1.00027     |  62.42   |\r\n|    60     |   1.00096     |  62.37   |\r\n|    70     |   1.00201     |  62.30   |\r\n|    80     |   1.00338     |  62.22   |\r\n|    90     |   1.00504     |  62.11   |\r\n|   100     |   1.00698     |  62.00   |\r\n|   110     |   1.00915     |  61.86   |\r\n|   120     |   1.01157     |  61.71   |\r\n|   130     |   1.01420     |  61.55   |\r\n|   140     |   1.01705     |  61.38   |\r\n|   150     |   1.02011     |  61.20   |\r\n|   160     |   1.02337     |  61.00   |\r\n|   170     |   1.02682     |  60.80   |\r\n|   180     |   1.03047     |  60.58   |\r\n|   190     |   1.03431     |  60.36   |\r\n|   200     |   1.03835     |  60.12   |\r\n|   210     |   1.04256     |  59.88   |\r\n|   212     |   1.04343     |  59.83   |\r\n|   220     |   1.0469      |  59.63   |\r\n|   230     |   1.0515      |  59.37   |\r\n|   240     |   1.0562      |  59.11   |\r\n|   250     |   1.0611      |  58.83   |\r\n|   260     |   1.0662      |  58.55   |\r\n|   270     |   1.0715      |  58.26   |\r\n|   280     |   1.0771      |  57.96   |\r\n|   290     |   1.0830      |  57.65   |\r\n|   300     |   1.0890      |  57.33   |\r\n|   310     |   1.0953      |  57.00   |\r\n|   320     |   1.1019      |  56.66   |\r\n|   330     |   1.1088      |  56.30   |\r\n|   340     |   1.1160      |  55.94   |\r\n|   350     |   1.1235      |  55.57   |\r\n|   360     |   1.1313      |  55.18   |\r\n|   370     |   1.1396      |  54.78   |\r\n|   380     |   1.1483      |  54.36   |\r\n|   390     |   1.1573      |  53.94   |\r\n|   400     |   1.167       |  53.5    |\r\n|   410     |   1.177       |  53.0    |\r\n|   420     |   1.187       |  52.6    |\r\n|   430     |   1.197       |  52.2    |\r\n|   440     |   1.208       |  51.7    |\r\n|   450     |   1.220       |  51.2    |\r\n|   460     |   1.232       |  50.7    |\r\n|   470     |   1.244       |  50.2    |\r\n|   480     |   1.256       |  49.7    |\r\n|   490     |   1.269       |  49.2    |\r\n|   500     |   1.283       |  48.7    |\r\n|   510     |   1.297       |  48.1    |\r\n|   520     |   1.312       |  47.6    |\r\n|   530     |   1.329       |  47.0    |\r\n|   540     |   1.35        |  46.3    |\r\n|   550     |   1.37        |  45.6    |\r\n|   560     |   1.39        |  44.9    |\r\n+-----------+---------------+----------+\r\n\r\nWater is but slightly compressible and for all practical purposes may be\r\nconsidered non-compressible. The coefficient of compressibility ranges\r\nfrom 0.000040 to 0.000051 per atmosphere at ordinary temperatures, this\r\ncoefficient decreasing as the temperature increases.\r\n\r\nTable 11 gives the weight in vacuo and the relative volume of a cubic\r\nfoot of distilled water at various temperatures.\r\n\r\nThe weight of water at the standard temperature being taken as 62.355\r\npounds per cubic foot, the pressure exerted by the column of water of\r\nany stated height, and conversely the height of any column required to\r\nproduce a stated pressure, may be computed as follows:\r\n\r\nThe pressure in pounds per square foot = 62.355 × height of column in\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\nThe pressure in pounds per square inch = 0.433 × height of column in\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\nHeight of column in feet = pressure in pounds per square foot ÷ 62.355.\r\n\r\nHeight of column in feet = pressure in pounds per square inch ÷ 0.433.\r\n\r\nHeight of column in inches = pressure in pounds per square inch × 27.71.\r\n\r\nHeight of column in inches = pressure in ounces per square inch × 1.73.\r\n\r\nBy a change in the weights given above, the pressure exerted and height\r\nof column may be computed for temperatures other than 62 degrees.\r\n\r\nA pressure of one pound per square inch is exerted by a column of water\r\n2.3093 feet or 27.71 inches high at 62 degrees Fahrenheit.\r\n\r\nWater in its natural state is never found absolutely pure. In solvent\r\npower water has a greater range than any other liquid. For common salt,\r\nthis is approximately a constant at all temperatures, while with such\r\nimpurities as magnesium and sodium sulphates, this solvent power\r\nincreases with an increase in temperature.\r\n\r\n                           TABLE 12\r\n\r\n          BOILING POINT OF WATER AT VARIOUS ALTITUDES\r\n\r\n+--------------+----------------+-------------+---------------+\r\n|Boiling Point | Altitude Above | Atmospheric |   Barometer   |\r\n|   Degrees    |   Sea Level    |  Pressure   |    Reduced    |\r\n|  Fahrenheit  |      Feet      | Pounds per  | to 32 Degrees |\r\n|              |                | Square Inch |    Inches     |\r\n+--------------+----------------+-------------+---------------+\r\n|     184      |     15221      |    8.20     |     16.70     |\r\n|     185      |     14649      |    8.38     |     17.06     |\r\n|     186      |     14075      |    8.57     |     17.45     |\r\n|     187      |     13498      |    8.76     |     17.83     |\r\n|     188      |     12934      |    8.95     |     18.22     |\r\n|     189      |     12367      |    9.14     |     18.61     |\r\n|     190      |     11799      |    9.34     |     19.02     |\r\n|     191      |     11243      |    9.54     |     19.43     |\r\n|     192      |     10685      |    9.74     |     19.85     |\r\n|     193      |     10127      |    9.95     |     20.27     |\r\n|     194      |      9579      |   10.17     |     20.71     |\r\n|     195      |      9031      |   10.39     |     21.15     |\r\n|     196      |      8481      |   10.61     |     21.60     |\r\n|     197      |      7932      |   10.83     |     22.05     |\r\n|     198      |      7381      |   11.06     |     22.52     |\r\n|     199      |      6843      |   11.29     |     22.99     |\r\n|     200      |      6304      |   11.52     |     23.47     |\r\n|     201      |      5764      |   11.76     |     23.95     |\r\n|     202      |      5225      |   12.01     |     24.45     |\r\n|     203      |      4697      |   12.26     |     24.96     |\r\n|     204      |      4169      |   12.51     |     25.48     |\r\n|     205      |      3642      |   12.77     |     26.00     |\r\n|     206      |      3115      |   13.03     |     26.53     |\r\n|     207      |      2589      |   13.30     |     27.08     |\r\n|     208      |      2063      |   13.57     |     27.63     |\r\n|     209      |      1539      |   13.85     |     28.19     |\r\n|     210      |      1025      |   14.13     |     28.76     |\r\n|     211      |       512      |   14.41     |     29.33     |\r\n|     212      |    Sea Level   |   14.70     |     29.92     |\r\n+--------------+----------------+-------------+---------------+\r\n\r\nSea water contains on an average approximately 3.125 per cent of its\r\nweight of solid matter or a thirty-second part of the weight of the\r\nwater and salt held in solution. The approximate composition of this\r\nsolid matter will be: sodium chloride 76 per cent, magnesium chloride 10\r\nper cent, magnesium sulphate 6 per cent, calcium sulphate 5 per cent,\r\ncalcium carbonate 0.5 per cent, other substances 2.5 per cent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 7200 Horse-power Installation of Babcock & Wilcox Boilers\r\nand Superheaters at the Capital Traction Co., Washington, D. C.]\r\n\r\nThe boiling point of water decreases as the altitude above sea level\r\nincreases. Table 12 gives the variation in the boiling point with the\r\naltitude.\r\n\r\nWater has a greater specific heat or heat-absorbing capacity than any\r\nother known substance (bromine and hydrogen excepted) and its specific\r\nheat is the basis for measurement of the capacity of heat absorption of\r\nall other substances. From the definition, the specific heat of water is\r\nthe number of British thermal units required to raise one pound of water\r\none degree. This specific heat varies with the temperature of the water.\r\nThe generally accepted values are given in Table 13, which indicates the\r\nvalues as determined by Messrs. Marks and Davis and Mr. Peabody.\r\n\r\n                        TABLE 13\r\n\r\n     SPECIFIC HEAT OF WATER AT VARIOUS TEMPERATURES\r\n\r\n+----------------------+--------------------------------+\r\n|   MARKS AND DAVIS    |            PEABODY             |\r\n|    From Values of    |         From Values of         |\r\n| Barnes and Dieterici |      Barnes and Regnault       |\r\n+-----------+----------+---------------------+----------+\r\n|Temperature| Specific |     Temperature     | Specific |\r\n+-----------+   Heat   +----------+----------+   Heat   |\r\n| Degrees   |          | Degrees  | Degrees  |          |\r\n|Fahrenheit |          |Centigrade|Fahrenheit|          |\r\n+-----------+----------+----------+----------+----------+\r\n|     30    |  1.0098  |    0     |    32    |  1.0094  |\r\n|     40    |  1.0045  |    5     |    41    |  1.0053  |\r\n|     50    |  1.0012  |   10     |    50    |  1.0023  |\r\n|     55    |  1.0000  |   15     |    59    |  1.0003  |\r\n|     60    |  0.9990  |   16.11  |    61    |  1.0000  |\r\n|     70    |  0.9977  |   20     |    68    |  0.9990  |\r\n|     80    |  0.9970  |   25     |    77    |  0.9981  |\r\n|     90    |  0.9967  |   30     |    86    |  0.9976  |\r\n|    100    |  0.9967  |   35     |    95    |  0.9974  |\r\n|    110    |  0.9970  |   40     |   104    |  0.9974  |\r\n|    120    |  0.9974  |   45     |   113    |  0.9976  |\r\n|    130    |  0.9979  |   50     |   122    |  0.9980  |\r\n|    140    |  0.9986  |   55     |   131    |  0.9985  |\r\n|    150    |  0.9994  |   60     |   140    |  0.9994  |\r\n|    160    |  1.0002  |   65     |   149    |  1.0004  |\r\n|    170    |  1.0010  |   70     |   158    |  1.0015  |\r\n|    180    |  1.0019  |   75     |   167    |  1.0028  |\r\n|    190    |  1.0029  |   80     |   176    |  1.0042  |\r\n|    200    |  1.0039  |   85     |   185    |  1.0056  |\r\n|    210    |  1.0052  |   90     |   194    |  1.0071  |\r\n|    220    |  1.007   |   95     |   203    |  1.0086  |\r\n|    230    |  1.009   |  100     |   212    |  1.0101  |\r\n+-----------+----------+----------+----------+----------+\r\n\r\nIn consequence of this variation in specific heat, the variation in the\r\nheat of the liquid of the water at different temperatures is not a\r\nconstant. Table 22[13] gives the heat of the liquid in a pound of water\r\nat temperatures ranging from 32 to 340 degrees Fahrenheit.\r\n\r\nThe specific heat of ice at 32 degrees is 0.463. The specific heat of\r\nsaturated steam (ice and saturated steam representing the other forms in\r\nwhich water may exist), is something that is difficult to define in any\r\nway which will not be misleading. When no liquid is present the specific\r\nheat of saturated steam is negative.[14] The use of the value of the\r\nspecific heat of steam is practically limited to instances where\r\nsuperheat is present, and the specific heat of superheated steam is\r\ncovered later in the book.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOILER FEED WATER\r\n\r\n\r\nAll natural waters contain some impurities which, when introduced into a\r\nboiler, may appear as solids. In view of the apparent present-day\r\ntendency toward large size boiler units and high overloads, the\r\nimportance of the use of pure water for boiler feed purposes cannot be\r\nover-estimated.\r\n\r\nOrdinarily, when water of sufficient purity for such use is not at hand,\r\nthe supply available may be rendered suitable by some process of\r\ntreatment. Against the cost of such treatment, there are many factors to\r\nbe considered. With water in which there is a marked tendency toward\r\nscale formation, the interest and depreciation on the added boiler units\r\nnecessary to allow for the systematic cleaning of certain units must be\r\ntaken into consideration. Again there is a considerable loss in taking\r\nboilers off for cleaning and replacing them on the line. On the other\r\nhand, the decrease in capacity and efficiency accompanying an increased\r\nincrustation of boilers in use has been too generally discussed to need\r\nrepetition here. Many experiments have been made and actual figures\r\nreported as to this decrease, but in general, such figures apply only to\r\nthe particular set of conditions found in the plant where the boiler in\r\nquestion was tested. So many factors enter into the effect of scale on\r\ncapacity and economy that it is impossible to give any accurate figures\r\non such decrease that will serve all cases, but that it is large has\r\nbeen thoroughly proven.\r\n\r\nWhile it is almost invariably true that practically any cost of\r\ntreatment will pay a return on the investment of the apparatus, the fact\r\nmust not be overlooked that there are certain waters which should never\r\nbe used for boiler feed purposes and which no treatment can render\r\nsuitable for such purpose. In such cases, the only remedy is the\r\nsecuring of other feed supply or the employment of evaporators for\r\ndistilling the feed water as in marine service.\r\n\r\n                               TABLE 14\r\n\r\n    APPROXIMATE CLASSIFICATION OF IMPURITIES FOUND IN FEED WATERS\r\n             THEIR EFFECT AND ORDINARY METHODS OF RELIEF\r\n\r\n+-----------------------+--------------+-----------------------------+\r\n| Difficulty Resulting  | Nature of    | Ordinary Method of          |\r\n| from Presence of      | Difficulty   | Overcoming or Relieving     |\r\n+-----------------------+--------------+-----------------------------+\r\n| Sediment, Mud, etc.   | Incrustation | Settling tanks, filtration, |\r\n|                       |              | blowing down.               |\r\n|                       |              |                             |\r\n| Readily Soluble Salts | Incrustation | Blowing down.               |\r\n|                       |              |                             |\r\n| Bicarbonates of Lime, | Incrustation | Heating feed.

A brief\r\noutline of the difficulties that may be experienced from the use of poor\r\nfeed water and a suggestion as to a method of overcoming certain of\r\nthese difficulties is all that will be attempted here. Such a brief\r\noutline of the subject, however, will indicate the necessity for a\r\nchemical analysis of any water before a treatment is tried and the\r\nnecessity of adapting the treatment in each case to the nature of the\r\ndifficulties that may be experienced.\r\n\r\nTable 14 gives a list of impurities which may be found in boiler feed\r\nwater, grouped according to their effect on boiler operation and giving\r\nthe customary method used for overcoming difficulty to which they lead.\r\n\r\n\r\nScale--Scale is formed on boiler heating surfaces by the depositing of\r\nimpurities in the feed water in the form of a more or less hard adherent\r\ncrust. Such deposits are due to the fact that water loses its soluble\r\npower at high temperatures or because the concentration becomes so high,\r\ndue to evaporation, that the impurities crystallize and adhere to the\r\nboiler surfaces. The opportunity for formation of scale in a boiler will\r\nbe apparent when it is realized that during a month's operation of a 100\r\nhorse-power boiler, 300 pounds of solid matter may be deposited from\r\nwater containing only 7 grains per gallon, while some spring and well\r\nwaters contain sufficient to cause a deposit of as high as 2000 pounds.\r\n\r\nThe salts usually responsible for such incrustation are the carbonates\r\nand sulphates of lime and magnesia, and boiler feed treatment in general\r\ndeals with the getting rid of these salts more or less completely.\r\n\r\n                         TABLE 15\r\n\r\n       SOLUBILITY OF MINERAL SALTS IN WATER (SPARKS)\r\nIN GRAINS PER U.

S. gallon (58,381 grains). It will be seen\r\nfrom this table that the carbonates of lime and magnesium are not\r\nsoluble above 212 degrees, and calcium sulphate while somewhat insoluble\r\nabove 212 degrees becomes more greatly so as the temperature increases.\r\n\r\nScale is also formed by the settling of mud and sediment carried in\r\nsuspension in water. This may bake or be cemented to a hard scale when\r\nmixed with other scale-forming ingredients.\r\n\r\n\r\nCorrosion--Corrosion, or a chemical action leading to the actual\r\ndestruction of the boiler metal, is due to the solvent or oxidizing\r\nproperties of the feed water. It results from the presence of acid,\r\neither free or developed[15] in the feed, the admixture of air with the\r\nfeed water, or as a result of a galvanic action. In boilers it takes\r\nseveral forms:\r\n\r\n1st. Pitting, which consists of isolated spots of active corrosion which\r\ndoes not attack the boiler as a whole.\r\n\r\n2nd. General corrosion, produced by naturally acid waters and where the\r\namount is so even and continuous that no accurate estimate of the metal\r\neaten away may be made.\r\n\r\n3rd. Grooving, which, while largely a mechanical action which may occur\r\nin neutral waters, is intensified by acidity.\r\n\r\nFoaming--This phenomenon, which ordinarily occurs with waters\r\ncontaminated with sewage or organic growths, is due to the fact that the\r\nsuspended particles collect on the surface of the water in the boiler\r\nand render difficult the liberation of steam bubbles arising to that\r\nsurface. It sometimes occurs with water containing carbonates in\r\nsolution in which a light flocculent precipitate will be formed on the\r\nsurface of the water. Again, it is the result of an excess of sodium\r\ncarbonate used in treatment for some other difficulty where animal or\r\nvegetable oil finds its way into the boiler.\r\n\r\nPriming--Priming, or the passing off of steam from a boiler in belches,\r\nis caused by the concentration of sodium carbonate, sodium sulphate or\r\nsodium chloride in solution. Sodium sulphate is found in many southern\r\nwaters and also where calcium or magnesium sulphate is precipitated with\r\nsoda ash.\r\n\r\nTreatment of Feed Water--For scale formation. The treatment of feed\r\nwater, carrying scale-forming ingredients, is along two main lines: 1st,\r\nby chemical means by which such impurities as are carried by the water\r\nare caused to precipitate; and 2nd, by the means of heat, which results\r\nin the reduction of the power of water to hold certain salts in\r\nsolution. The latter method alone is sufficient in the case of certain\r\ntemporarily hard waters, but the heat treatment, in general, is used in\r\nconnection with a chemical treatment to assist the latter.\r\n\r\nBefore going further into detail as to the treatment of water, it may be\r\nwell to define certain terms used.\r\n\r\n_Hardness_, which is the most widely known evidence of the presence in\r\nwater of scale-forming matter, is that quality, the variation of which\r\nmakes it more difficult to obtain a lather or suds from soap in one\r\nwater than in another. This action is made use of in the soap test for\r\nhardness described later. Hardness is ordinarily classed as either\r\ntemporary or permanent. Temporarily hard waters are those containing\r\ncarbonates of lime and magnesium, which may be precipitated by boiling\r\nat 212 degrees and which, if they contain no other scale-forming\r\ningredients, become \"soft\" under such treatment. Permanently hard waters\r\nare those containing mainly calcium sulphate, which is only precipitated\r\nat the high temperatures found in the boiler itself, 300 degrees\r\nFahrenheit or more. The scale of hardness is an arbitrary one, based on\r\nthe number of grains of solids per gallon and waters may be classed on\r\nsuch a basis as follows: 1-10 grain per gallon, soft water; 10-20 grain\r\nper gallon, moderately hard water; above 25 grains per gallon, very hard\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n_Alkalinity_ is a general term used for waters containing compounds with\r\nthe power of neutralizing acids.\r\n\r\n_Causticity_, as used in water treatment, is a term coined by A. McGill,\r\nindicating the presence of an excess of lime added during treatment.\r\nThough such presence would also indicate alkalinity, the term is\r\narbitrarily used to apply to those hydrates whose presence is indicated\r\nby phenolphthalein.\r\n\r\nOf the chemical methods of water treatment, there are three general\r\nprocesses:\r\n\r\n1st. Lime Process. The lime process is used for waters containing\r\nbicarbonates of lime and magnesia. Slacked lime in solution, as lime\r\nwater, is the reagent used. This combines with the carbonic acid which\r\nis present, either free or as carbonates, to form an insoluble\r\nmonocarbonate of lime. The soluble bicarbonates of lime and magnesia,\r\nlosing their carbonic acid, thereby become insoluble and precipitate.\r\n\r\n2nd. Soda Process. The soda process is used for waters containing\r\nsulphates of lime and magnesia. Carbonate of soda and hydrate of soda\r\n(caustic soda) are used either alone or together as the reagents.\r\nCarbonate of soda, added to water containing little or no carbonic acid\r\nor bicarbonates, decomposes the sulphates to form insoluble carbonate of\r\nlime or magnesia which precipitate, the neutral soda remaining in\r\nsolution. If free carbonic acid or bicarbonates are present, bicarbonate\r\nof lime is formed and remains in solution, though under the action of\r\nheat, the carbon dioxide will be driven off and insoluble monocarbonates\r\nwill be formed. Caustic soda used in this process causes a more\r\nenergetic action, it being presumed that the caustic soda absorbs the\r\ncarbonic acid, becomes carbonate of soda and acts as above.\r\n\r\n3rd. Lime and Soda Process. This process, which is the combination of\r\nthe first two, is by far the most generally used in water purification.\r\nSuch a method is used where sulphates of lime and magnesia are contained\r\nin the water, together with such quantity of carbonic acid or\r\nbicarbonates as to impair the action of the soda. Sufficient soda is\r\nused to break down the sulphates of lime and magnesia and as much lime\r\nadded as is required to absorb the carbonic acid not taken up in the\r\nsoda reaction.\r\n\r\nAll of the apparatus for effecting such treatment of feed waters is\r\napproximately the same in its chemical action, the numerous systems\r\ndiffering in the methods of introduction and handling of the reagents.\r\n\r\nThe methods of testing water treated by an apparatus of this description\r\nfollow.\r\n\r\nWhen properly treated, alkalinity, hardness and causticity should be in\r\nthe approximate relation of 6, 5 and 4. When too much lime is used in\r\nthe treatment, the causticity in the purified water, as indicated by the\r\nacid test, will be nearly equal to the alkalinity. If too little lime is\r\nused, the causticity will fall to approximately half the alkalinity. The\r\nhardness should not be in excess of two points less than the alkalinity.\r\nWhere too great a quantity of soda is used, the hardness is lowered and\r\nthe alkalinity raised. If too little soda, the hardness is raised and\r\nthe alkalinity lowered.\r\n\r\nAlkalinity and causticity are tested with a standard solution of\r\nsulphuric acid. A standard soap solution is used for testing for\r\nhardness and a silver nitrate solution may also be used for determining\r\nwhether an excess of lime has been used in the treatment.\r\n\r\nAlkalinity: To 50 cubic centimeters of treated water, to which there has\r\nbeen added sufficient methylorange to color it, add the acid solution,\r\ndrop by drop, until the mixture is on the point of turning red. As the\r\nacid solution is first added, the red color, which shows quickly,\r\ndisappears on shaking the mixture, and this color disappears more slowly\r\nas the critical point is approached. One-tenth cubic centimeter of the\r\nstandard acid solution corresponds to one degree of alkalinity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 2640 Horse-power Installation of Babcock & Wilcox Boilers\r\nat the Botany Worsted Mills, Passaic, N. J.]\r\n\r\nCausticity: To 50 cubic centimeters of treated water, to which there has\r\nbeen added one drop of phenolphthalein dissolved in alcohol to give the\r\nwater a pinkish color, add the acid solution, drop by drop, shaking\r\nafter each addition, until the color entirely disappears. One-tenth\r\ncubic centimeter of acid solution corresponds to one degree of\r\ncausticity.\r\n\r\nThe alkalinity may be determined from the same sample tested for\r\ncausticity by the coloring with methylorange and adding the acid until\r\nthe sample is on the point of turning red. The total acid added in\r\ndetermining both causticity and alkalinity in this case is the measure\r\nof the alkalinity.\r\n\r\nHardness: 100 cubic centimeters of the treated water is used for this\r\ntest, one cubic centimeter of the soap solution corresponding to one\r\ndegree of hardness. The soap solution is added a very little at a time\r\nand the whole violently shaken. Enough of the solution must be added to\r\nmake a permanent lather or foam, that is, the soap bubbles must not\r\ndisappear after the shaking is stopped.\r\n\r\nExcess of lime as determined by nitrate of silver: If there is an excess\r\nof lime used in the treatment, a sample will become a dark brown by the\r\naddition of a small quantity of silver nitrate, otherwise a milky white\r\nsolution will be formed.\r\n\r\nCombined Heat and Chemical Treatment: Heat is used in many systems of\r\nfeed treatment apparatus as an adjunct to the chemical process. Heat\r\nalone will remove temporary hardness by the precipitation of carbonates\r\nof lime and magnesia and, when used in connection with the chemical\r\nprocess, leaves only the permanent hardness or the sulphates of lime to\r\nbe taken care of by chemical treatment.\r\n\r\n                     TABLE 16\r\n\r\n    REAGENTS REQUIRED IN LIME AND SODA PROCESS\r\n     FOR TREATING 1000 U.

The efficiency of such apparatus\r\nwill depend wholly upon the amount and character of the impurities in\r\nthe water to be treated. Table 16 gives the amount of lime and soda\r\nrequired per 1000 gallons for each grain per gallon of the various\r\nimpurities found in the water. This table is based on lime containing 90\r\nper cent calcium oxide and soda containing 58 per cent sodium oxide,\r\nwhich correspond to the commercial quality ordinarily purchasable. From\r\nthis table and the cost of the lime and soda, the cost of treating any\r\nwater per 1000 gallons may be readily computed.\r\n\r\nLess Usual Reagents--Barium hydrate is sometimes used to reduce\r\npermanent hardness or the calcium sulphate component. Until recently,\r\nthe high cost of barium hydrate has rendered its use prohibitive but at\r\nthe present it is obtained as a by-product in cement manufacture and it\r\nmay be purchased at a more reasonable figure than heretofore. It acts\r\ndirectly on the soluble sulphates to form barium sulphate which is\r\ninsoluble and may be precipitated. Where this reagent is used, it is\r\ndesirable that the reaction be allowed to take place outside of the\r\nboiler, though there are certain cases where its internal use is\r\npermissible.\r\n\r\nBarium carbonate is sometimes used in removing calcium sulphate, the\r\nproducts of the reaction being barium sulphate and calcium carbonate,\r\nboth of which are insoluble and may be precipitated. As barium carbonate\r\nin itself is insoluble, it cannot be added to water as a solution and\r\nits use should, therefore, be confined to treatment outside of the\r\nboiler.\r\n\r\nSilicate of soda will precipitate calcium carbonate with the formation\r\nof a gelatinous silicate of lime and carbonate of soda. If calcium\r\nsulphate is also present, carbonate of soda is formed in the above\r\nreaction, which in turn will break down the sulphate.\r\n\r\nOxalate of soda is an expensive but efficient reagent which forms a\r\nprecipitate of calcium oxalate of a particularly insoluble nature.\r\n\r\nAlum and iron alum will act as efficient coagulents where organic matter\r\nis present in the water. Iron alum has not only this property but also\r\nthat of reducing oil discharged from surface condensers to a condition\r\nin which it may be readily removed by filtration.\r\n\r\nCorrosion--Where there is a corrosive action because of the presence of\r\nacid in the water or of oil containing fatty acids which will decompose\r\nand cause pitting wherever the sludge can find a resting place, it may\r\nbe overcome by the neutralization of the water by carbonate of soda.\r\nSuch neutralization should be carried to the point where the water will\r\njust turn red litmus paper blue. As a preventative of such action\r\narising from the presence of the oil, only the highest grades of\r\nhydrocarbon oils should be used.\r\n\r\nAcidity will occur where sea water is present in a boiler. There is the\r\npossibility of such an occurrence in marine practice and in stationary\r\nplants using sea water for condensing, due to leaky condenser tubes,\r\npriming in the evaporators, etc. Such acidity is caused through the\r\ndissociation of magnesium chloride into hydrochloride acid and magnesia\r\nunder high temperatures. The acid in contact with the metal forms an\r\niron salt which immediately upon its formation is neutralized by the\r\nfree magnesia in the water, thereby precipitating iron oxide and\r\nreforming magnesium chloride. The preventive for corrosion arising from\r\nsuch acidity is the keeping tight of the condenser. Where it is\r\nunavoidable that some sea water should find its way into a boiler, the\r\nacidity resulting should be neutralized by soda ash. This will convert\r\nthe magnesium chloride into magnesium carbonate and sodium chloride,\r\nneither of which is corrosive but both of which are scale-forming.\r\n\r\nThe presence of air in the feed water which is sucked in by the feed\r\npump is a well recognized cause of corrosion. Air bubbles form below the\r\nwater line and attack the metal of the boiler, the oxygen of the air\r\ncausing oxidization of the boiler metal and the formation of rust. The\r\nparticle of rust thus formed is swept away by the circulation or is\r\ndislodged by expansion and the minute pit thus left forms an ideal\r\nresting place for other air bubbles and the continuation of the\r\noxidization process. The prevention is, of course, the removing of the\r\nair from the feed water. In marine practice, where there has been\r\nexperienced the most difficulty from this source, it has been found to\r\nbe advantageous to pump the water from the hot well to a filter tank\r\nplaced above the feed pump suction valves. In this way the air is\r\nliberated from the surface of the tank and a head is assured for the\r\nsuction end of the pump. In this same class of work, the corrosive\r\naction of air is reduced by introducing the feed through a spray nozzle\r\ninto the steam space above the water line.\r\n\r\nGalvanic action, resulting in the eating away of the boiler metal\r\nthrough electrolysis was formerly considered practically the sole cause\r\nof corrosion. But little is known of such action aside from the fact\r\nthat it does take place in certain instances. The means adopted as a\r\nremedy is usually the installation of zinc plates within the boiler,\r\nwhich must have positive metallic contact with the boiler metal. In this\r\nway, local electrolytic effects are overcome by a still greater\r\nelectrolytic action at the expense of the more positive zinc. The\r\npositive contact necessary is difficult to maintain and it is\r\nquestionable just what efficacy such plates have except for a short\r\nperiod after their installation when the contact is known to be\r\npositive. Aside from protection from such electrolytic action, however,\r\nthe zinc plates have a distinct use where there is the liability of air\r\nin the feed, as they offer a substance much more readily oxidized by\r\nsuch air than the metal of the boiler.\r\n\r\nFoaming--Where foaming is caused by organic matter in suspension, it may\r\nbe largely overcome by filtration or by the use of a coagulent in\r\nconnection with filtration, the latter combination having come recently\r\ninto considerable favor. Alum, or potash alum, and iron alum, which in\r\nreality contains no alumina and should rather be called potassia-ferric,\r\nare the coagulents generally used in connection with filtration. Such\r\nmatter as is not removed by filtration may, under certain conditions, be\r\nhandled by surface blowing. In some instances, settling tanks are used\r\nfor the removal of matter in suspension, but where large quantities of\r\nwater are required, filtration is ordinarily substituted on account of\r\nthe time element and the large area necessary in settling tanks.\r\n\r\nWhere foaming occurs as the result of overtreatment of the feed water,\r\nthe obvious remedy is a change in such treatment.\r\n\r\nPriming--Where priming is caused by excessive concentration of salts\r\nwithin a boiler, it may be overcome largely by frequent blowing down.\r\nThe degree of concentration allowable before priming will take place\r\nvaries widely with conditions of operation and may be definitely\r\ndetermined only by experience with each individual set of conditions. It\r\nis the presence of the salts that cause priming that may result in the\r\nabsolute unfitness of water for boiler feed purposes. Where these salts\r\nexist in such quantities that the amount of blowing down necessary to\r\nkeep the degree of concentration below the priming point results in\r\nexcessive losses, the only remedy is the securing of another supply of\r\nfeed, and the results will warrant the change almost regardless of the\r\nexpense. In some few instances, the impurities may be taken care of by\r\nsome method of water treatment but such water should be submitted to an\r\nauthority on the subject before any treatment apparatus is installed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 3000 Horse-power Installation of Cross Drum Babcock &\r\nWilcox Boilers and Superheaters Equipped with Babcock & Wilcox Chain\r\nGrate Stokers at the Washington Terminal Co., Washington, D. C.]\r\n\r\nBoiler Compounds--The method of treatment of feed water by far the most\r\ngenerally used is by the use of some of the so-called boiler compounds.\r\nThere are many reliable concerns handling such compounds who\r\nunquestionably secure the promised results, but there is a great\r\ntendency toward looking on the compound as a \"cure all\" for any water\r\ndifficulties and care should be taken to deal only with reputable\r\nconcerns.\r\n\r\nThe composition of these compounds is almost invariably based on soda\r\nwith certain tannic substances and in some instances a gelatinous\r\nsubstance which is presumed to encircle scale particles and prevent\r\ntheir adhering to the boiler surfaces. The action of these compounds is\r\nordinarily to reduce the calcium sulphate in the water by means of\r\ncarbonate of soda and to precipitate it as a muddy form of calcium\r\ncarbonate which may be blown off. The tannic compounds are used in\r\nconnection with the soda with the idea of introducing organic matter\r\ninto any scale already formed. When it has penetrated to the boiler\r\nmetal, decomposition of the scale sets in, causing a disruptive effect\r\nwhich breaks the scale from the metal sometimes in large slabs. It is\r\nthis effect of boiler compounds that is to be most carefully guarded\r\nagainst or inevitable trouble will result from the presence of loose\r\nscale with the consequent danger of tube losses through burning.\r\n\r\nWhen proper care is taken to suit the compound to the water in use, the\r\nresults secured are fairly effective. In general, however, the use of\r\ncompounds may only be recommended for the prevention of scale rather\r\nthan with the view to removing scale which has already formed, that is,\r\nthe compounds should be introduced with the feed water only when the\r\nboiler has been thoroughly cleaned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEED WATER HEATING AND METHODS OF FEEDING\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore water fed into a boiler can be converted into steam, it must be\r\nfirst heated to a temperature corresponding to the pressure within the\r\nboiler. Steam at 160 pounds gauge pressure has a temperature of\r\napproximately 371 degrees Fahrenheit. If water is fed to the boiler at\r\n60 degrees Fahrenheit, each pound must have 311 B. t. u. added to it to\r\nincrease its temperature 371 degrees, which increase must take place\r\nbefore the water can be converted into steam. As it requires 1167.8\r\nB. t. u. to raise one pound of water from 60 to 371 degrees and to\r\nconvert it into steam at 160 pounds gauge pressure, the 311 degrees\r\nrequired simply to raise the temperature of the water from 60 to 371\r\ndegrees will be approximately 27 per cent of the total. If, therefore,\r\nthe temperature of the water can be increased from 60 to 371 degrees\r\nbefore it is introduced into a boiler by the utilization of heat from\r\nsome source that would otherwise be wasted, there will be a saving in\r\nthe fuel required of 311 ÷ 1167.8 = 27 per cent, and there will be a net\r\nsaving, provided the cost of maintaining and operating the apparatus for\r\nsecuring this saving is less than the value of the heat thus saved.\r\n\r\nThe saving in the fuel due to the heating of feed water by means of heat\r\nthat would otherwise be wasted may be computed from the formula:\r\n\r\n                       100 (t - t_{i})\r\nFuel saving per cent = ---------------      (1)\r\n                       H + 32 - t_{i}\r\n\r\nwhere, t = temperature of feed water after heating, t_{i} = temperature\r\nof feed water before heating, and H = total heat above 32 degrees per\r\npound of steam at the boiler pressure. Values of H may be found in Table\r\n23. Table 17 has been computed from this formula to show the fuel saving\r\nunder the conditions assumed with the boiler operating at 180 pounds\r\ngauge pressure.\r\n\r\n                       TABLE 17\r\n\r\n  SAVING IN FUEL, IN PER CENT, BY HEATING FEED WATER\r\n               GAUGE PRESSURE 180 POUNDS\r\n\r\n+-----------+-----------------------------------------+\r\n|  Initial  |  Final Temperature--Degrees Fahrenheit  |\r\n|Temperature|-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----|\r\n| Fahrenheit| 120 | 140 | 160 | 180 | 200 | 250 | 300 |\r\n+-----------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+\r\n|     32    | 7.35| 9.02|10.69|12.36|14.04|18.20|22.38|\r\n|     35    | 7.12| 8.79|10.46|12.14|13.82|18.00|22.18|\r\n|     40    | 6.72| 8.41|10.09|11.77|13.45|17.65|21.86|\r\n|     45    | 6.33| 8.02| 9.71|11.40|13.08|17.30|21.52|\r\n|     50    | 5.93| 7.63| 9.32|11.02|12.72|16.95|21.19|\r\n|     55    | 5.53| 7.24| 8.94|10.64|12.34|16.60|20.86|\r\n|     60    | 5.13| 6.84| 8.55|10.27|11.97|16.24|20.52|\r\n|     65    | 4.72| 6.44| 8.16| 9.87|11.59|15.88|20.18|\r\n|     70    | 4.31| 6.04| 7.77| 9.48|11.21|15.52|19.83|\r\n|     75    | 3.90| 5.64| 7.36| 9.09|10.82|15.16|19.48|\r\n|     80    | 3.48| 5.22| 6.96| 8.70|10.44|14.79|19.13|\r\n|     85    | 3.06| 4.80| 6.55| 8.30|10.05|14.41|18.78|\r\n|     90    | 2.63| 4.39| 6.14| 7.89| 9.65|14.04|18.43|\r\n|     95    | 2.20| 3.97| 5.73| 7.49| 9.25|13.66|18.07|\r\n|    100    | 1.77| 3.54| 5.31| 7.08| 8.85|13.28|17.70|\r\n|    110    |  .89| 2.68| 4.47| 6.25| 8.04|12.50|16.97|\r\n|    120    |  .00| 1.80| 3.61| 5.41| 7.21|11.71|16.22|\r\n|    130    |     |  .91| 2.73| 4.55| 6.37|10.91|15.46|\r\n|    140    |     |  .00| 1.84| 3.67| 5.51|10.09|14.68|\r\n|    150    |     |     |  .93| 2.78| 4.63| 9.26|13.89|\r\n|    160    |     |     |  .00| 1.87| 3.74| 8.41|13.09|\r\n|    170    |     |     |     |  .94| 2.83| 7.55|12.27|\r\n|    180    |     |     |     |  .00| 1.91| 6.67|11.43|\r\n|    190    |     |     |     |     |  .96| 5.77|10.58|\r\n|    200    |     |     |     |     |  .00| 4.86| 9.71|\r\n|    210    |     |     |     |     |     | 3.92| 8.82|\r\n+-----------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+\r\n\r\nBesides the saving in fuel effected by the use of feed water heaters,\r\nother advantages are secured. The time required for the conversion of\r\nwater into steam is diminished and the steam capacity of the boiler\r\nthereby increased. Further, the feeding of cold water into a boiler has\r\na tendency toward the setting up of temperature strains, which are\r\ndiminished in proportion as the temperature of the feed approaches that\r\nof the steam. An important additional advantage of heating feed water is\r\nthat in certain types of heaters a large portion of the scale forming\r\ningredients are precipitated before entering the boiler, with a\r\nconsequent saving in cleaning and losses through decreased efficiency\r\nand capacity.\r\n\r\nIn general, feed water heaters may be divided into closed heaters, open\r\nheaters and economizers; the first two depend for their heat upon\r\nexhaust, or in some cases live steam, while the last class utilizes the\r\nheat of the waste flue gases to secure the same result. The question of\r\nthe type of apparatus to be installed is dependent upon the conditions\r\nattached to each individual case.\r\n\r\nIn closed heaters the feed water and the exhaust steam do not come into\r\nactual contact with each other. Either the steam or the water passes\r\nthrough tubes surrounded by the other medium, as the heater is of the\r\nsteam-tube or water-tube type. A closed heater is best suited for water\r\nfree from scale-forming matter, as such matter soon clogs the passages.\r\nCleaning such heaters is costly and the efficiency drops off rapidly as\r\nscale forms. A closed heater is not advisable where the engines work\r\nintermittently, as is the case with mine hoisting engines. In this class\r\nof work the frequent coolings between operating periods and the sudden\r\nheatings when operation commences will tend to loosen the tubes or even\r\npull them apart. For this reason, an open heater, or economizer, will\r\ngive more satisfactory service with intermittently operating apparatus.\r\n\r\nOpen heaters are best suited for waters containing scale-forming matter.\r\nMuch of the temporary hardness may be precipitated in the heater and the\r\nsediment easily removed. Such heaters are frequently used with a reagent\r\nfor precipitating permanent hardness in the combined heat and chemical\r\ntreatment of feed water. The so-called live steam purifiers are open\r\nheaters, the water being raised to the boiling temperature and the\r\ncarbonates and a portion of the sulphates being precipitated. The\r\ndisadvantage of this class of apparatus is that some of the sulphates\r\nremain in solution to be precipitated as scale when concentrated in the\r\nboiler. Sufficient concentration to have such an effect, however, may\r\noften be prevented by frequent blowing down.\r\n\r\nEconomizers find their largest field where the design of the boiler is\r\nsuch that the maximum possible amount of heat is not extracted from the\r\ngases of combustion. The more wasteful the boiler, the greater the\r\nsaving effected by the use of the economizer, and it is sometimes\r\npossible to raise the temperature of the feed water to that of high\r\npressure steam by the installation of such an apparatus, the saving\r\namounting in some cases to as much as 20 per cent. The fuel used bears\r\ndirectly on the question of the advisability of an economizer\r\ninstallation, for when oil is the fuel a boiler efficiency of 80 per\r\ncent or over is frequently realized, an efficiency which would leave a\r\nsmall opportunity for a commercial gain through the addition of an\r\neconomizer.\r\n\r\nFrom the standpoint of space requirements, economizers are at a\r\ndisadvantage in that they are bulky and require a considerable increase\r\nover space occupied by a heater of the exhaust type. They also require\r\nadditional brickwork or a metal casing, which increases the cost.\r\nSometimes, too, the frictional resistance of the gases through an\r\neconomizer make its adaptability questionable because of the draft\r\nconditions. When figuring the net return on economizer investment, all\r\nof these factors must be considered.\r\n\r\nWhen the feed water is such that scale will quickly encrust the\r\neconomizer and throw it out of service for cleaning during an excessive\r\nportion of the time, it will be necessary to purify water before\r\nintroducing it into an economizer to make it earn a profit on the\r\ninvestment.\r\n\r\nFrom the foregoing, it is clearly indicated that it is impossible to\r\nmake a definite statement as to the relative saving by heating feed\r\nwater in any of the three types. Each case must be worked out\r\nindependently and a decision can be reached only after an exhaustive\r\nstudy of all the conditions affecting the case, including the time the\r\nplant will be in service and probable growth of the plant. When, as a\r\nresult of such study, the possible methods for handling the problem have\r\nbeen determined, the solution of the best apparatus can be made easily\r\nby the balancing of the saving possible by each method against its first\r\ncost, depreciation, maintenance and cost of operation.\r\n\r\nFeeding of Water--The choice of methods to be used in introducing feed\r\nwater into a boiler lies between an injector and a pump. In most plants,\r\nan injector would not be economical, as the water fed by such means must\r\nbe cold, a fact which makes impossible the use of a heater before the\r\nwater enters the injector. Such a heater might be installed between the\r\ninjector and the boiler but as heat is added to the water in the\r\ninjector, the heater could not properly fulfill its function.\r\n\r\n                                 TABLE 18\r\n\r\n                     COMPARISON OF PUMPS AND INJECTORS\r\n _________________________________________________________________________\r\n|                              |                     |                    |\r\n|     Method of Supplying      |                     |                    |\r\n|     Feed-water to Boiler     | Relative amount of  | Saving of fuel over|\r\n| Temperature of feed-water as | coal required per   | the amount required|\r\n| delivered to the pump or to  | unit of time, the   | when the boiler is |\r\n| injector, 60 degrees Fahren- | amount for a direct-| fed by a direct-   |\r\n| heit.

If a pump is used in feeding the\r\nwater to a boiler and the heat in the exhaust from the pump is imparted\r\nto the feed water, the pump has as high a thermal efficiency as the\r\ninjector. The pump has the further advantage that it uses so much less\r\nsteam for the forcing of a given quantity of water into the boiler that\r\nit makes possible a greater saving through the use of the exhaust from\r\nother auxiliaries for heating the feed, which exhaust, if an injector\r\nwere used, would be wasted, as has been pointed out.\r\n\r\nIn locomotive practice, injectors are used because there is no exhaust\r\nsteam available for heating the feed, this being utilized in producing a\r\nforced draft, and because of space requirements. In power plant work,\r\nhowever, pumps are universally used for regular operation, though\r\ninjectors are sometimes installed as an auxiliary method of feeding.\r\n\r\nTable 18 shows the relative value of injectors, direct-acting steam\r\npumps and pumps driven from the engine, the data having been obtained\r\nfrom actual experiment. It will be noted that when feeding cold water\r\ndirect to the boilers, the injector has a slightly greater economy but\r\nwhen feeding through a heater, the pump is by far the more economical.\r\n\r\nAuxiliaries--It is the general impression that auxiliaries will take\r\nless steam if the exhaust is turned into the condensers, in this way\r\nreducing the back pressure. As a matter of fact, vacuum is rarely\r\nregistered on an indicator card taken from the cylinders of certain\r\ntypes of auxiliaries unless the exhaust connection is short and without\r\nbends, as long pipes and many angles offset the effect of the condenser.\r\nOn the other hand, if the exhaust steam from the auxiliaries can be used\r\nfor heating the feed water, all of the latent heat less only the loss\r\ndue to radiation is returned to the boiler and is saved instead of being\r\nlost in the condensing water or wasted with the free exhaust. Taking\r\ninto consideration the plant as a whole, it would appear that the\r\nauxiliary machinery, under such conditions, is more efficient than the\r\nmain engines.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Portion of 4160 Horse-power Installation of Babcock &\r\nWilcox Boilers at the Prudential Life Insurance Co. Building, Newark,\r\nN. J.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTEAM\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen a given weight of a perfect gas is compressed or expanded at a\r\nconstant temperature, the product of the pressure and volume is a\r\nconstant. Vapors, which are liquids in aeriform condition, on the other\r\nhand, can exist only at a definite pressure corresponding to each\r\ntemperature if in the saturated state, that is, the pressure is a\r\nfunction of the temperature only. Steam is water vapor, and at a\r\npressure of, say, 150 pounds absolute per square inch saturated steam\r\ncan exist only at a temperature 358 degrees Fahrenheit. Hence if the\r\npressure of saturated steam be fixed, its temperature is also fixed, and\r\n_vice versa_.\r\n\r\nSaturated steam is water vapor in the condition in which it is generated\r\nfrom water with which it is in contact. Or it is steam which is at the\r\nmaximum pressure and density possible at its temperature. If any change\r\nbe made in the temperature or pressure of steam, there will be a\r\ncorresponding change in its condition. If the pressure be increased or\r\nthe temperature decreased, a portion of the steam will be condensed. If\r\nthe temperature be increased or the pressure decreased, a portion of the\r\nwater with which the steam is in contact will be evaporated into steam.\r\nSteam will remain saturated just so long as it is of the same pressure\r\nand temperature as the water with which it can remain in contact without\r\na gain or loss of heat. Moreover, saturated steam cannot have its\r\ntemperature lowered without a lowering of its pressure, any loss of heat\r\nbeing made up by the latent heat of such portion as will be condensed.\r\nNor can the temperature of saturated steam be increased except when\r\naccompanied by a corresponding increase in pressure, any added heat\r\nbeing expended in the evaporation into steam of a portion of the water\r\nwith which it is in contact.\r\n\r\nDry saturated steam contains no water. In some cases, saturated steam is\r\naccompanied by water which is carried along with it, either in the form\r\nof a spray or is blown along the surface of the piping, and the steam is\r\nthen said to be wet. The percentage weight of the steam in a mixture of\r\nsteam and water is called the quality of the steam. Thus, if in a\r\nmixture of 100 pounds of steam and water there is three-quarters of a\r\npound of water, the quality of the steam will be 99.25.\r\n\r\nHeat may be added to steam not in contact with water, such an addition\r\nof heat resulting in an increase of temperature and pressure if the\r\nvolume be kept constant, or an increase in temperature and volume if the\r\npressure remain constant. Steam whose temperature thus exceeds that of\r\nsaturated steam at a corresponding pressure is said to be superheated\r\nand its properties approximate those of a perfect gas.\r\n\r\nAs pointed out in the chapter on heat, the heat necessary to raise one\r\npound of water from 32 degrees Fahrenheit to the point of ebullition is\r\ncalled the _heat of the liquid_. The heat absorbed during ebullition\r\nconsists of that necessary to dissociate the molecules, or the _inner\r\nlatent heat_, and that necessary to overcome the resistance to the\r\nincrease in volume, or the _outer latent heat_. These two make up the\r\n_latent heat of evaporation_ and the sum of this latent heat of\r\nevaporation and the heat of the liquid make the _total heat_ of the\r\nsteam. These values for various pressures are given in the steam tables,\r\npages 122 to 127.\r\n\r\nThe specific volume of saturated steam at any pressure is the volume in\r\ncubic feet of one pound of steam at that pressure.\r\n\r\nThe density of saturated steam, that is, its weight per cubic foot, is\r\nobviously the reciprocal of the specific volume. This density varies as\r\nthe 16/17 power over the ordinary range of pressures used in steam\r\nboiler work and may be found by the formula, D = .003027p^{.941}, which\r\nis correct within 0.15 per cent up to 250 pounds pressure.\r\n\r\nThe relative volume of steam is the ratio of the volume of a given\r\nweight to the volume of the same weight of water at 39.2 degrees\r\nFahrenheit and is equal to the specific volume times 62.427.\r\n\r\nAs vapors are liquids in their gaseous form and the boiling point is the\r\npoint of change in this condition, it is clear that this point is\r\ndependent upon the pressure under which the liquid exists. This fact is\r\nof great practical importance in steam condenser work and in many\r\noperations involving boiling in an open vessel, since in the latter case\r\nits altitude will have considerable influence. The relation between\r\naltitude and boiling point of water is shown in Table 12.\r\n\r\nThe conditions of feed temperature and steam pressure in boiler tests,\r\nfuel performances and the like, will be found to vary widely in\r\ndifferent trials. In order to secure a means for comparison of different\r\ntrials, it is necessary to reduce all results to some common basis. The\r\nmethod which has been adopted for the reduction to a comparable basis is\r\nto transform the evaporation under actual conditions of steam pressure\r\nand feed temperature which exist in the trial to an equivalent\r\nevaporation under a set of standard conditions. These standard\r\nconditions presuppose a feed water temperature of 212 degrees Fahrenheit\r\nand a steam pressure equal to the normal atmospheric pressure at sea\r\nlevel, 14.7 pounds absolute. Under such conditions steam would be\r\ngenerated _at_ a temperature of 212 degrees, the temperature\r\ncorresponding to atmospheric pressure at sea level, _from_ water at 212\r\ndegrees. The weight of water which _would_ be evaporated under the\r\nassumed standard conditions by exactly the amount of heat absorbed by\r\nthe boiler under actual conditions existing in the trial, is, therefore,\r\ncalled the equivalent evaporation \"from and at 212 degrees.\"\r\n\r\nThe factor for reducing the weight of water actually converted into\r\nsteam from the temperature of the feed, at the steam pressure existing\r\nin the trial, to the equivalent evaporation under standard conditions is\r\ncalled the _factor of evaporation._ This factor is the ratio of the\r\ntotal heat added to one pound of steam under the standard conditions to\r\nthe heat added to each pound of steam in heating the water from the\r\ntemperature of the feed in the trial to the temperature corresponding to\r\nthe pressure existing in the trial. This heat added is obviously the\r\ndifference between the total heat of evaporation of the steam at the\r\npressure existing in the trial and the heat of the liquid in the water\r\nat the temperature at which it was fed in the trial. To illustrate by an\r\nexample:\r\n\r\nIn a boiler trial the temperature of the feed water is 60 degrees\r\nFahrenheit and the pressure under which steam is delivered is 160.3\r\npounds gauge pressure or 175 pounds absolute pressure. The total heat of\r\none pound of steam at 175 pounds pressure is 1195.9 B. t. u. measured\r\nabove the standard temperature of 32 degrees Fahrenheit. But the water\r\nfed to the boiler contained 28.08 B. t. u. as the heat of the liquid\r\nmeasured above 32 degrees Fahrenheit. Therefore, to each pound of steam\r\nthere has been added 1167.82 B. t. u. To evaporate one pound of water\r\nunder standard conditions would, on the other hand, have required but\r\n970.4 B. t. u., which, as described, is the latent heat of evaporation\r\nat 212 degrees Fahrenheit. Expressed differently, the total heat of one\r\npound of steam at the pressure corresponding to a temperature of 212\r\ndegrees is 1150.4 B. t. u. One pound of water at 212 degrees contains\r\n180 B. t. u. of sensible heat above 32 degrees Fahrenheit. Hence, under\r\nstandard conditions, 1150.4 - 180 = 970.4 B. t. u. is added in the\r\nchanging of one pound of water into steam at atmospheric pressure and a\r\ntemperature of 212 degrees. This is in effect the definition of the\r\nlatent heat of evaporation.\r\n\r\nHence, if conditions of the trial had been standard, only 970.4 B. t. u.\r\nwould be required and the ratio of 1167.82 to 970.4 B. t. u. is the\r\nratio determining the factor of evaporation. The factor in the assumed\r\ncase is 1167.82 ÷ 970.4 = 1.2034 and if the same amount of heat had been\r\nabsorbed under standard conditions as was absorbed in the trial\r\ncondition, 1.2034 times the amount of steam would have been generated.\r\nExpressed as a formula for use with any set of conditions, the factor\r\nis,\r\n\r\n    H - h\r\nF = -----      (2)\r\n    970.4\r\n\r\nWhere H = the total heat of steam above 32 degrees Fahrenheit from steam\r\n          tables,\r\n      h = sensible heat of feed water above 32 degrees Fahrenheit from\r\n          Table 22.\r\n\r\nIn the form above, the factor may be determined with either saturated or\r\nsuperheated steam, provided that in the latter case values of H are\r\navailable for varying degrees of superheat and pressures.\r\n\r\nWhere such values are not available, the form becomes,\r\n\r\n    H - h + s(t_{sup} - t_{sat})\r\nF = ----------------------------      (3)\r\n               970.4\r\n\r\nWhere             s = mean specific heat of superheated steam at the\r\n                      pressure existing in the trial from saturated\r\n                      steam to the temperature existing in the trial,\r\n            t_{sup} = final temperature of steam,\r\n            t_{sat} = temperature of saturated steam, corresponding to\r\n                      pressure existing,\r\n(t_{sup} - t_{sat}) = degrees of superheat.\r\n\r\nThe specific heat of superheated steam will be taken up later.\r\n\r\nTable 19 gives factors of evaporation for saturated steam boiler trials\r\nto cover a large range of conditions. Except for the most refined work,\r\nintermediate values may be determined by interpolation.\r\n\r\nSteam gauges indicate the pressure above the atmosphere. As has been\r\npointed out, the atmospheric pressure changes according to the altitude\r\nand the variation in the barometer. Hence, calculations involving the\r\nproperties of steam are based on _absolute_ pressures, which are equal\r\nto the gauge pressure plus the atmospheric pressure in pounds to the\r\nsquare inch. This latter is generally assumed to be 14.7 pounds per\r\nsquare inch at sea level, but for other levels it must be determined\r\nfrom the barometric reading at that place.\r\n\r\nVacuum gauges indicate the difference, expressed in inches of mercury,\r\nbetween atmospheric pressure and the pressure within the vessel to which\r\nthe gauge is attached. For approximate purposes, 2.04 inches height of\r\nmercury may be considered equal to a pressure of one pound per square\r\ninch at the ordinary temperatures at which mercury gauges are used.\r\nHence for any reading of the vacuum gauge in inches, G, the absolute\r\npressure for any barometer reading in inches, B, will be (B - G) ÷ 2.04.\r\nIf the barometer is 30 inches measured at ordinary temperatures and not\r\ncorrected to 32 degrees Fahrenheit and the vacuum gauge 24 inches, the\r\nabsolute pressure will be (30 - 24) ÷ 2.04 = 2.9 pounds per square inch.\r\n\r\n

The percentage increase in the\r\ntotal heat is small, being 0.5, 3.1, and 4.7 per cent for 20, 100, and\r\n300 pounds absolute pressure respectively above the total heat in one\r\npound of steam at 14.7 pounds absolute. The temperatures, on the other\r\nhand, increase at the rates of 7.5, 54.6, and 96.9 per cent. The\r\nefficiency of a perfect steam engine is proportional to the expression\r\n(t - t_{1})/t in which t and t_{1} are the absolute temperatures of the\r\nsaturated steam at admission and exhaust respectively. While actual\r\nengines only approximate the ideal engine in efficiency, yet they follow\r\nthe same general law. Since the exhaust temperature cannot be lowered\r\nbeyond present practice, it follows that the only available method of\r\nincreasing the efficiency is by an increase in the temperature of the\r\nsteam at admission. How this may be accomplished by an increase of\r\npressure is clearly shown, for the increase of fuel necessary to\r\nincrease the pressure is negligible, as shown by the total heat, while\r\nthe increase in economy, due to the higher pressure, will result\r\ndirectly from the rapid increase of the corresponding temperature.\r\n\r\n             TABLE 22\r\n\r\n     HEAT UNITS PER POUND AND\r\n

predicted from the formula for the\r\nefficiency of a perfect steam engine given on page 119. This formula is\r\nnot applicable in cases where superheat is present since only a\r\nrelatively small amount of the heat in the steam is imparted at the\r\nmaximum or superheated temperature.\r\n\r\nThe advantage of the use of high pressure steam may be also indicated by\r\nconsidering the question from the aspect of volume. With an increase of\r\npressure comes a decrease in volume, thus one pound of saturated steam\r\nat 100 pounds absolute pressure occupies 4.43 cubic feet, while at 200\r\npounds pressure it occupies 2.29 cubic feet. If then, in separate\r\ncylinders of the same dimensions, one pound of steam at 100 pounds\r\nabsolute pressure and one pound at 200 pounds absolute pressure enter\r\nand are allowed to expand to the full volume of each cylinder, the\r\nhigh-pressure steam, having more room and a greater range for expansion\r\nthan the low-pressure steam, will thus do more work. This increase in\r\nthe amount of work, as was the increase in temperature, is large\r\nrelative to the additional fuel required as indicated by the total heat.\r\nIn general, it may be stated that the fuel required to impart a given\r\namount of heat to a boiler is practically independent of the steam\r\npressure, since the temperature of the fire is so high as compared with\r\nthe steam temperature that a variation in the steam temperature does not\r\nproduce an appreciable effect.\r\n\r\nThe formulae for the algebraic expression of the relation between\r\nsaturated steam pressures, temperatures and steam volumes have been up\r\nto the present time empirical. These relations have, however, been\r\ndetermined by experiment and, from the experimental data, tables have\r\nbeen computed which render unnecessary the use of empirical formulae.\r\nSuch formulae may be found in any standard work of thermo-dynamics. The\r\nfollowing tables cover all practical cases.\r\n\r\nTable 22 gives the heat units contained in water above 32 degrees\r\nFahrenheit at different temperatures.\r\n\r\nTable 23 gives the properties of saturated steam for various pressures.\r\n\r\nTable 24 gives the properties of superheated steam at various pressures\r\nand temperatures.\r\n\r\nThese tables are based on those computed by Lionel S. Marks and Harvey\r\nN. Davis, these being generally accepted as being the most correct.\r\n\r\n                               TABLE 23\r\n\r\n                    PROPERTIES OF SATURATED STEAM\r\n\r\n                    REPRODUCED BY PERMISSION FROM\r\n             MARKS AND DAVIS \"STEAM TABLES AND DIAGRAMS\"\r\n             (Copyright, 1909, by Longmans, Green & Co.)\r\n ____________________________________________________________________\r\n|Pressure,| Temper- |Specific Vol-|Heat of    |Latent Heat|Total Heat|\r\n| Pounds  |ature De-| ume Cu.

Graphic Method of Determining Moisture Contained in Steam from\r\nCalorimeter Readings]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMOISTURE IN STEAM\r\n\r\n\r\nThe presence of moisture in steam causes a loss, not only in the\r\npractical waste of the heat utilized to raise this moisture from the\r\ntemperature of the feed water to the temperature of the steam, but also\r\nthrough the increased initial condensation in an engine cylinder and\r\nthrough friction and other actions in a steam turbine. The presence of\r\nsuch moisture also interferes with proper cylinder lubrication, causes a\r\nknocking in the engine and a water hammer in the steam pipes. In steam\r\nturbines it will cause erosion of the blades.\r\n\r\nThe percentage by weight of steam in a mixture of steam and water is\r\ncalled the _quality of the steam_.\r\n\r\nThe apparatus used to determine the moisture content of steam is called\r\na calorimeter though since it may not measure the heat in the steam, the\r\nname is not descriptive of the function of the apparatus. The first form\r\nused was the \"barrel calorimeter\", but the liability of error was so\r\ngreat that its use was abandoned. Modern calorimeters are in general of\r\neither the throttling or separator type.\r\n\r\nThrottling Calorimeter--Fig. 14 shows a typical form of throttling\r\ncalorimeter. Steam is drawn from a vertical main through the sampling\r\nnipple, passes around the first thermometer cup, then through a\r\none-eighth inch orifice in a disk between two flanges, and lastly around\r\nthe second thermometer cup and to the atmosphere. Thermometers are\r\ninserted in the wells, which should be filled with mercury or heavy\r\ncylinder oil.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 14. Throttling Calorimeter and Sampling Nozzle]\r\n\r\nThe instrument and all pipes and fittings leading to it should be\r\nthoroughly insulated to diminish radiation losses. Care must be taken to\r\nprevent the orifice from becoming choked with dirt and to see that no\r\nleaks occur. The exhaust pipe should be short to prevent back pressure\r\nbelow the disk.\r\n\r\nWhen steam passes through an orifice from a higher to a lower pressure,\r\nas is the case with the throttling calorimeter, no external work has to\r\nbe done in overcoming a resistance. Hence, if there is no loss from\r\nradiation, the quantity of heat in the steam will be exactly the same\r\nafter passing the orifice as before passing. If the higher steam\r\npressure is 160 pounds gauge and the lower pressure that of the\r\natmosphere, the total heat in a pound of dry steam at the former\r\npressure is 1195.9 B. t. u. and at the latter pressure 1150.4 B. t. u.,\r\na difference of 45.4 B. t. u. As this heat will still exist in the steam\r\nat the lower pressure, since there is no external work done, its effect\r\nmust be to superheat the steam. Assuming the specific heat of\r\nsuperheated steam to be 0.47, each pound passing through will be\r\nsuperheated 45.4/0.47 = 96.6 degrees. If, however, the steam had\r\ncontained one per cent of moisture, it would have contained less heat\r\nunits per pound than if it were dry. Since the latent heat of steam at\r\n160 pounds gauge pressure is 852.8 B. t. u., it follows that the one per\r\ncent of moisture would have required 8.5 B. t. u. to evaporate it,\r\nleaving only 45.4 - 8.5 = 36.9 B. t. u. available for superheating;\r\nhence, the superheat would be 36.9/0.47 = 78.5 degrees, as against 96.6\r\ndegrees for dry steam. In a similar manner, the degree of superheat for\r\nother percentages of moisture may be determined. The action of the\r\nthrottling calorimeter is based upon the foregoing facts, as shown\r\nbelow.\r\n\r\nLet     H = total heat of one pound of steam at boiler pressure,\r\n        L = latent heat of steam at boiler pressure,\r\n        h = total heat of steam at reduced pressure after passing\r\n            orifice,\r\n    t_{1} = temperature of saturated steam at the reduced pressure,\r\n    t_{2} = temperature of steam after expanding through the orifice\r\n            in the disc,\r\n     0.47 = the specific heat of saturated steam at atmospheric pressure,\r\n        x = proportion by weight of moisture in steam.\r\n\r\nThe difference in B. t. u. in a pound of steam at the boiler pressure\r\nand after passing the orifice is the heat available for evaporating the\r\nmoisture content and superheating the steam. Therefore,\r\n\r\nH - h = xL + 0.47(t_{2} - t_{1})\r\n\r\n       H - h - 0.47(t_{2} - t_{1})\r\nor x = ---------------------------      (4)\r\n                    L\r\n\r\nAlmost invariably the lower pressure is taken as that of the atmosphere.\r\nUnder such conditions, h = 1150.4 and t_{1} = 212 degrees. The formula\r\nthus becomes:\r\n\r\n    H - 1150.4 - 0.47(t_{2} - 212)\r\nx = ------------------------------      (5)\r\n                  L\r\n\r\nFor practical work it is more convenient to dispense with the upper\r\nthermometer in the calorimeter and to measure the pressure in the steam\r\nmain by an accurate steam pressure gauge.\r\n\r\nA chart may be used for determining the value of x for approximate work\r\nwithout the necessity for computation. Such a chart is shown in Fig. 15\r\nand its use is as follows: Assume a gauge pressure of 180 pounds and a\r\nthermometer reading of 295 degrees. The intersection of the vertical\r\nline from the scale of temperatures as shown by the calorimeter\r\nthermometer and the horizontal line from the scale of gauge pressures\r\nwill indicate directly the per cent of moisture in the steam as read\r\nfrom the diagonal scale. In the present instance, this per cent is 1.0.\r\n\r\nSources of Error in the Apparatus--A slight error may arise from the\r\nvalue, 0.47, used as the specific heat of superheated steam at\r\natmospheric pressure. This value, however is very nearly correct and any\r\nerror resulting from its use will be negligible.\r\n\r\nThere is ordinarily a larger source of error due to the fact that the\r\nstem of the thermometer is not heated to its full length, to an initial\r\nerror in the thermometer and to radiation losses.\r\n\r\nWith an ordinary thermometer immersed in the well to the 100 degrees\r\nmark, the error when registering 300 degrees would be about 3 degrees\r\nand the true temperature be 303 degrees.[19]\r\n\r\nThe steam is evidently losing heat through radiation from the moment it\r\nenters the sampling nipple. The heat available for evaporating moisture\r\nand superheating steam after it has passed through the orifice into the\r\nlower pressure will be diminished by just the amount lost through\r\nradiation and the value of t_{2}, as shown by the calorimeter\r\nthermometer, will, therefore, be lower than if there were no such loss.\r\nThe method of correcting for the thermometer and radiation error\r\nrecommended by the Power Test Committee of the American Society of\r\nMechanical Engineers is by referring the readings as found on the boiler\r\ntrial to a \"normal\" reading of the thermometer. This normal reading is\r\nthe reading of the lower calorimeter thermometer for dry saturated\r\nsteam, and should be determined by attaching the instrument to a\r\nhorizontal steam pipe in such a way that the sampling nozzle projects\r\nupward to near the top of the pipe, there being no perforations in the\r\nnozzle and the steam taken only through its open upper end. The test\r\nshould be made with the steam in a quiescent state and with the steam\r\npressure maintained as nearly as possible at the pressure observed in\r\nthe main trial, the calorimeter thermometer to be the same as was used\r\non the trial or one exactly similar.\r\n\r\nWith a normal reading thus obtained for a pressure approximately the\r\nsame as existed in the trial, the true percentage of moisture in the\r\nsteam, that is, with the proper correction made for radiation, may be\r\ncalculated as follows:\r\n\r\nLet T denote the normal reading for the conditions existing in the\r\ntrial. The effect of radiation from the instrument as pointed out will\r\nbe to lower the temperature of the steam at the lower pressure. Let\r\nx_{1} represent the proportion of water in the steam which will lower\r\nits temperature an amount equal to the loss by radiation. Then,\r\n\r\n        H - h - 0.47(T - t_{1})\r\nx_{1} = -----------------------\r\n                   L\r\n\r\nThis amount of moisture, x_{1} was not in the steam originally but is\r\nthe result of condensation in the instrument through radiation. Hence,\r\nthe true amount of moisture in the steam represented by X is the\r\ndifference between the amount as determined in the trial and that\r\nresulting from condensation, or,\r\n\r\nX = x - x_{1}\r\n\r\n    H - h - 0.47(t_{2} - t_{1})   H - h - 0.47(T - t_{1})\r\n  = --------------------------- - -----------------------\r\n                 L                        L\r\n\r\n    0.47(T - t_{2})\r\n  = ---------------      (6)\r\n           L\r\n\r\nAs T and t_{2} are taken with the same thermometer under the same set of\r\nconditions, any error in the reading of the thermometers will be\r\napproximately the same for the temperatures T and t_{2} and the above\r\nmethod therefore corrects for both the radiation and thermometer errors.\r\nThe theoretical readings for dry steam, where there are no losses due to\r\nradiation, are obtainable from formula (5) by letting x = 0 and solving\r\nfor t_{2}. The difference between the theoretical reading and the normal\r\nreading for no moisture will be the thermometer and radiation correction\r\nto be applied in order that the correct reading of t_{2} may be\r\nobtained.\r\n\r\nFor any calorimeter within the range of its ordinary use, such a\r\nthermometer and radiation correction taken from one normal reading is\r\napproximately correct for any conditions with the same or a duplicate\r\nthermometer.\r\n\r\nThe percentage of moisture in the steam, corrected for thermometer error\r\nand radiation and the correction to be applied to the particular\r\ncalorimeter used, would be determined as follows: Assume a gauge\r\npressure in the trial to be 180 pounds and the thermometer reading to be\r\n295 degrees. A normal reading, taken in the manner described, gives a\r\nvalue of T = 303 degrees; then, the percentage of moisture corrected for\r\nthermometer error and radiation is,\r\n\r\n     0.47(303 - 295)\r\nx = ----------------\r\n          845.0\r\n\r\n  = 0.45 per cent.\r\n\r\nThe theoretical reading for dry steam will be,\r\n\r\n        1197.7 - 1150.4 - 0.47(t_{2} - 212)\r\n   0  = ------------------------------------\r\n                        845.0\r\n\r\nt_{2} = 313 degrees.\r\n\r\nThe thermometer and radiation correction to be applied to the instrument\r\nused, therefore over the ordinary range of pressure is\r\n\r\n        Correction = 313 - 303 = 10 degrees\r\n\r\nThe chart may be used in the determination of the correct reading of\r\nmoisture percentage and the permanent radiation correction for the\r\ninstrument used without computation as follows: Assume the same trial\r\npressure, feed temperature and normal reading as above. If the normal\r\nreading is found to be 303 degrees, the correction for thermometer and\r\nradiation will be the theoretical reading for dry steam as found from\r\nthe chart, less this normal reading, or 10 degrees correction. The\r\ncorrect temperature for the trial in question is, therefore, 305\r\ndegrees. The moisture corresponding to this temperature and 180 pounds\r\ngauge pressure will be found from the chart to be 0.45 per cent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 16. Compact Throttling Calorimeter]\r\n\r\nThere are many forms of throttling calorimeter, all of which work upon\r\nthe same principle. The simplest one is probably that shown in Fig. 14.\r\nAn extremely convenient and compact design is shown in Fig. 16. This\r\ncalorimeter consists of two concentric metal cylinders screwed to a cap\r\ncontaining a thermometer well. The steam pressure is measured by a gauge\r\nplaced in the supply pipe or other convenient location. Steam passes\r\nthrough the orifice A and expands to atmospheric pressure, its\r\ntemperature at this pressure being measured by a thermometer placed in\r\nthe cup C. To prevent as far as possible radiation losses, the annular\r\nspace between the two cylinders is used as a jacket, steam being\r\nsupplied to this space through the hole B.\r\n\r\nThe limits of moisture within which the throttling calorimeter will work\r\nare, at sea level, from 2.88 per cent at 50 pounds gauge pressure and\r\n7.17 per cent moisture at 250 pounds pressure.\r\n\r\nSeparating Calorimeter--The separating calorimeter mechanically\r\nseparates the entrained water from the steam and collects it in a\r\nreservoir, where its amount is either indicated by a gauge glass or is\r\ndrained off and weighed. Fig. 17 shows a calorimeter of this type. The\r\nsteam passes out of the calorimeter through an orifice of known size so\r\nthat its total amount can be calculated or it can be weighed. A gauge is\r\nordinarily provided with this type of calorimeter, which shows the\r\npressure in its inner chamber and the flow of steam for a given period,\r\nthis latter scale being graduated by trial.\r\n\r\nThe instrument, like a throttling calorimeter, should be well insulated\r\nto prevent losses from radiation.\r\n\r\nWhile theoretically the separating calorimeter is not limited in\r\ncapacity, it is well in cases where the percentage of moisture present\r\nin the steam is known to be high, to attach a throttling calorimeter to\r\nits exhaust. This, in effect, is the using of the separating calorimeter\r\nas a small separator between the sampling nozzle and the throttling\r\ninstrument, and is necessary to insure the determination of the full\r\npercentage of moisture in the steam. The sum of the percentages shown by\r\nthe two instruments is the moisture content of the steam.\r\n\r\nThe steam passing through a separating calorimeter may be calculated by\r\nNapier's formula, the size of the orifice being known. There are\r\nobjections to such a calculation, however, in that it is difficult to\r\naccurately determine the areas of such small orifices. Further, small\r\norifices have a tendency to become partly closed by sediment that may be\r\ncarried by the steam. The more accurate method of determining the amount\r\nof steam passing through the instrument is as follows:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 17. Separating Calorimeter]\r\n\r\nA hose should be attached to the separator outlet leading to a vessel of\r\nwater on a platform scale graduated to 1/100 of a pound. The steam\r\noutlet should be connected to another vessel of water resting on a\r\nsecond scale. In each case, the weight of each vessel and its contents\r\nshould be noted. When ready for an observation, the instrument should be\r\nblown out thoroughly so that there will be no water within the\r\nseparator. The separator drip should then be closed and the steam hose\r\ninserted into the vessel of water at the same instant. When the\r\nseparator has accumulated a sufficient quantity of water, the valve of\r\nthe instrument should be closed and the hose removed from the vessel of\r\nwater. The separator should be emptied into the vessel on its scale. The\r\nfinal weight of each vessel and its contents are to be noted and the\r\ndifferences between the final and original weights will represent the\r\nweight of moisture collected by the separator and the weight of steam\r\nfrom which the moisture has been taken. The proportion of moisture can\r\nthen be calculated from the following formula:\r\n\r\n    100 w\r\nx = -----      (7)\r\n    W - w\r\n\r\nWhere x = per cent moisture in steam,\r\n      W = weight of steam condensed,\r\n      w = weight of moisture as taken out by the separating\r\n          calorimeter.\r\n\r\nSampling Nipple--The principle source of error in steam calorimeter\r\ndeterminations is the failure to obtain an average sample of the steam\r\ndelivered by the boiler and it is extremely doubtful whether such a\r\nsample is ever obtained. The two governing features in the obtaining of\r\nsuch a sample are the type of sampling nozzle used and its location.\r\n\r\nThe American Society of Mechanical Engineers recommends a sampling\r\nnozzle made of one-half inch iron pipe closed at the inner end and the\r\ninterior portion perforated with not less than twenty one-eighth inch\r\nholes equally distributed from end to end and preferably drilled in\r\nirregular or spiral rows, with the first hole not less than one-half\r\ninch from the wall of the pipe. Many engineers object to the use of a\r\nperforated sampling nipple because it ordinarily indicates a higher\r\npercentage of moisture than is actually present in the steam. This is\r\ndue to the fact that if the perforations come close to the inner surface\r\nof the pipe, the moisture, which in many instances clings to this\r\nsurface, will flow into the calorimeter and cause a large error. Where a\r\nperforated nipple is used, in general it may be said that the\r\nperforations should be at least one inch from the inner pipe surface.\r\n\r\nA sampling nipple, open at the inner end and unperforated, undoubtedly\r\ngives as accurate a measure as can be obtained of the moisture in the\r\nsteam passing that end. It would appear that a satisfactory method of\r\nobtaining an average sample of the steam would result from the use of an\r\nopen end unperforated nipple passing through a stuffing box which would\r\nallow the end to be placed at any point across the diameter of the steam\r\npipe.\r\n\r\nIncidental to a test of a 15,000 K. W. steam engine turbine unit, Mr.\r\nH. G. Stott and Mr. R. G. S. Pigott, finding no experimental data\r\nbearing on the subject of low pressure steam quality determinations,\r\nmade a investigation of the subject and the sampling nozzle illustrated\r\nin Fig. 18 was developed. In speaking of sampling nozzles in the\r\ndetermination of the moisture content of low pressure steam, Mr. Pigott\r\nsays, \"the ordinary standard perforated pipe sampler is absolutely\r\nworthless in giving a true sample and it is vital that the sample be\r\nabstracted from the main without changing its direction or velocity\r\nuntil it is safely within the sample pipe and entirely isolated from the\r\nrest of the steam.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 18. Stott and Pigott Sampling Nozzle]\r\n\r\nIt would appear that the nozzle illustrated is undoubtedly the best that\r\nhas been developed for use in the determination of the moisture content\r\nof steam, not only in the case of low, but also in high pressure steam.\r\n\r\nLocation of Sampling Nozzle--The calorimeter should be located as near\r\nas possible to the point from which the steam is taken and the sampling\r\nnipple should be placed in a section of the main pipe near the boiler\r\nand where there is no chance of moisture pocketing in the pipe. The\r\nAmerican Society of Mechanical Engineers recommends that a sampling\r\nnipple, of which a description has been given, should be located in a\r\nvertical main, rising from the boiler with its closed end extending\r\nnearly across the pipe. Where non-return valves are used, or where there\r\nare horizontal connections leading from the boiler to a vertical outlet,\r\nwater may collect at the lower end of the uptake pipe and be blown\r\nupward in a spray which will not be carried away by the steam owing to a\r\nlack of velocity. A sample taken from the lower part of this pipe will\r\nshow a greater amount of moisture than a true sample. With goose-neck\r\nconnections a small amount of water may collect on the bottom of the\r\npipe near the upper end where the inclination is such that the tendency\r\nto flow backward is ordinarily counterbalanced by the flow of steam\r\nforward over its surface; but when the velocity momentarily decreases\r\nthe water flows back to the lower end of the goose-neck and increases\r\nthe moisture at that point, making it an undesirable location for\r\nsampling. In any case, it should be borne in mind that with low\r\nvelocities the tendency is for drops of entrained water to settle to the\r\nbottom of the pipe, and to be temporarily broken up into spray whenever\r\nan abrupt bend or other disturbance is met.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 19. Illustrating the Manner in which Erroneous\r\nCalorimeter Readings may be Obtained due to Improper Location of Sampling\r\nNozzle\r\n\r\n    Case 1--Horizontal pipe. Water flows at bottom. If perforations\r\n    in nozzle are too near bottom of pipe, water piles against\r\n    nozzle, flows into calorimeter and gives false reading.\r\n    Case 2--If nozzle located too near junction of two horizontal\r\n    runs, as at a, condensation from vertical pipe which collects at\r\n    this point will be thrown against the nozzle by the velocity of\r\n    the steam, resulting in a false reading. Nozzle should be\r\n    located far enough above junction to be removed from water kept\r\n    in motion by the steam velocity, as at b. Case 3--Condensation\r\n    in bend will be held by velocity of the steam as shown. When\r\n    velocity is diminished during firing intervals and the like\r\n    moisture flows back against nozzle, a, and false reading is\r\n    obtained. A true reading will be obtained at b provided\r\n    condensation is not blown over on nozzle. Case 4--Where\r\n    non-return valve is placed before a bend, condensation will\r\n    collect on steam line side and water will be swept by steam\r\n    velocity against nozzle and false readings result.]\r\n\r\nFig. 19 indicates certain locations of sampling nozzles from which\r\nerroneous results will be obtained, the reasons being obvious from a\r\nstudy of the cuts.\r\n\r\nBefore taking any calorimeter reading, steam should be allowed to flow\r\nthrough the instrument freely until it is thoroughly heated. The method\r\nof using a throttling calorimeter is evident from the description of the\r\ninstrument given and the principle upon which it works.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Babcock & Wilcox Superheater]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSUPERHEATED STEAM\r\n\r\n\r\nSuperheated steam, as already stated, is steam the temperature of which\r\nexceeds that of saturated steam at the same pressure. It is produced by\r\nthe addition of heat to saturated steam which has been removed from\r\ncontact with the water from which it was generated. The properties of\r\nsuperheated steam approximate those of a perfect gas rather than of a\r\nvapor. Saturated steam cannot be superheated when it is in contact with\r\nwater which is also heated, neither can superheated steam condense\r\nwithout first being reduced to the temperature of saturated steam. Just\r\nso long as its temperature is above that of saturated steam at a\r\ncorresponding pressure it is superheated, and before condensation can\r\ntake place that superheat must first be lost through radiation or some\r\nother means. Table 24[20] gives such properties of superheated steam for\r\nvarying pressures as are necessary for use in ordinary engineering\r\npractice.\r\n\r\nSpecific Heat of Superheated Steam--The specific heat of superheated\r\nsteam at atmospheric pressure and near saturation point was determined\r\nby Regnault, in 1862, who gives it the value of 0.48. Regnault's value\r\nwas based on four series of experiments, all at atmospheric pressure and\r\nwith about the same temperature range, the maximum of which was 231.1\r\ndegrees centigrade. For fifty years after Regnault's determination, this\r\nvalue was accepted and applied to higher pressures and temperatures as\r\nwell as to the range of his experiments. More recent investigations have\r\nshown that the specific heat is not a constant and varies with both\r\npressure and the temperature. A number of experiments have been made by\r\nvarious investigators and, up to the present, the most reliable appear\r\nto be those of Knoblauch and Jacob. Messrs. Marks and Davis have used\r\nthe values as determined by Knoblauch and Jacob with slight\r\nmodifications. The first consists in a varying of the curves at low\r\npressures close to saturation because of thermodynamic evidence and in\r\nview of Regnault's determination at atmospheric pressure. The second\r\nmodification is at high degrees of superheat to follow Holborn's and\r\nHenning's curve, which is accepted as authentic.\r\n\r\nFor the sake of convenience, the mean specific heat of superheated steam\r\nat various pressures and temperatures is given in tabulated form in\r\nTable 25. These values have been calculated from Marks and Davis Steam\r\nTables by deducting from the total heat of one pound of steam at any\r\npressure for any degree of superheat the total heat of one pound of\r\nsaturated steam at the same pressure and dividing the difference by the\r\nnumber of degrees of superheat and, therefore, represent the average\r\nspecific heat starting from that at saturation to the value at the\r\nparticular pressure and temperature.[21] Expressed as a formula this\r\ncalculation is represented by\r\n\r\n          H_{sup} - H_{sat}\r\nSp.

h\r\nFactor of evaporation = -----\r\n                          L\r\n\r\nHere H = total heat in one pound of superheated steam from the table,\r\nh and L having the same values as in (2).\r\n\r\nWhere no such tables are available but the specific heat of superheat is\r\nknown, the formula becomes:\r\n\r\n                        H - h + Sp. Ht.(T - t)\r\nFactor of evaporation = ----------------------\r\n                                  L\r\n\r\nWhere H = total heat in one pound of saturated steam at pressure\r\n          existing in trial,\r\n      h = sensible heat above 32 degrees in one pound of water at the\r\n          temperature entering the boiler,\r\n      T = temperature of superheated steam as determined in the trial,\r\n      t = temperature of saturated steam corresponding to the boiler\r\n          pressure,\r\nSp. Ht. = mean specific heat of superheated steam at the pressure and\r\n          temperature as found in the trial,\r\n      L = latent heat of one pound of saturated steam at atmospheric\r\n          pressure.\r\n\r\nAdvantages of the Use of Superheated Steam--In considering the saving\r\npossible by the use of superheated steam, it is too often assumed that\r\nthere is only a saving in the prime movers, a saving which is at least\r\npartially offset by an increase in the fuel consumption of the boilers\r\ngenerating steam. This misconception is due to the fact that the fuel\r\nconsumption of the boiler is only considered in connection with a\r\ndefinite weight of steam. It is true that where such a definite weight\r\nis to be superheated, an added amount of fuel must be burned. With a\r\nproperly designed superheater where the combined efficiency of the\r\nboiler and superheater will be at least as high as of a boiler alone,\r\nthe approximate increase in coal consumption for producing a given\r\nweight of steam will be as follows:\r\n\r\n_Superheat_      _Added Fuel_\r\n _Degrees_        _Per Cent_\r\n    25               1.59\r\n    50               3.07\r\n    75               4.38\r\n   100               5.69\r\n   150               8.19\r\n   200              10.58\r\n\r\nThese figures represent the added fuel necessary for superheating a\r\ndefinite weight of steam to the number of degrees as given. The standard\r\nbasis, however, of boiler evaporation is one of heat units and,\r\nconsidered from such a standpoint, again providing the efficiency of the\r\nboiler and superheater is as high, as of a boiler alone, there is no\r\nadditional fuel required to generate steam containing a definite number\r\nof heat units whether such units be due to superheat or saturation. That\r\nis, if 6 per cent more fuel is required to generate and superheat to 100\r\ndegrees, a definite weight of steam, over what would be required to\r\nproduce the same weight of saturated steam, that steam when superheated,\r\nwill contain 6 per cent more heat units above the fuel water temperature\r\nthan if saturated. This holds true if the efficiency of the boiler and\r\nsuperheater combined is the same as of the boiler alone. As a matter of\r\nfact, the efficiency of a boiler and superheater, where the latter is\r\nproperly designed and located, will be slightly higher for the same set\r\nof furnace conditions than would the efficiency of a boiler in which no\r\nsuperheater were installed. A superheater, properly placed within the\r\nboiler setting in such way that products of combustion for generating\r\nsaturated steam are utilized as well for superheating that steam, will\r\nnot in any way alter furnace conditions. With a given set of such\r\nfurnace conditions for a given amount of coal burned, the fact that\r\nadditional surface, whether as boiler heating or superheating surface,\r\nis placed in such a manner that the gases must sweep over it, will tend\r\nto lower the temperature of the exit gases. It is such a lowering of\r\nexit gas temperatures that is the ultimate indication of added\r\nefficiency. Though the amount of this added efficiency is difficult to\r\ndetermine by test, that there is an increase is unquestionable.\r\n\r\nWhere a properly designed superheater is installed in a boiler the\r\nheating surface of the boiler proper, in the generation of a definite\r\nnumber of heat units, is relieved of a portion of the work which would\r\nbe required were these heat units delivered in saturated steam. Such a\r\nsuperheater needs practically no attention, is not subject to a large\r\nupkeep cost or depreciation, and performs its function without in any\r\nway interfering with the operation of the boiler. Its use, therefore\r\nfrom the standpoint of the boiler room, results in a saving in wear and\r\ntear due to the lower ratings at which the boiler may be run, or its use\r\nwill lead to the possibility of obtaining the same number of boiler\r\nhorse power from a smaller number of boilers, with the boiler heating\r\nsurface doing exactly the same amount of work as if the superheaters\r\nwere not installed. The saving due to the added boiler efficiency that\r\nwill be obtained is obvious.\r\n\r\nFollowing the course of the steam in a plant, the next advantage of the\r\nuse of superheated steam is the absence of water in the steam pipes. The\r\nthermal conductivity of superheated steam, that is, its power to give up\r\nits heat to surrounding bodies, is much lower than that of saturated\r\nsteam and its heat, therefore, will not be transmitted so rapidly to the\r\nwalls of the pipes as when saturated steam is flowing through the pipes.\r\nThe loss of heat radiated from a steam pipe, assuming no loss in\r\npressure, represents the equivalent condensation when the pipe is\r\ncarrying saturated steam. In well-covered steam mains, the heat lost by\r\nradiation when carrying superheated steam is accompanied only by a\r\nreduction of the superheat which, if it be sufficiently high at the\r\nboiler, will enable a considerable amount of heat to be radiated and\r\nstill deliver dry or superheated steam to the prime movers.\r\n\r\nIt is in the prime movers that the advantages of the use of superheated\r\nsteam are most clearly seen.\r\n\r\nIn an engine, steam is admitted into a space that has been cooled by the\r\nsteam exhausted during the previous stroke. The heat necessary to warm\r\nthe cylinder walls from the temperature of the exhaust to that of the\r\nentering steam can be supplied only by the entering steam. If this steam\r\nbe saturated, such an adding of heat to the walls at the expense of the\r\nheat of the entering steam results in the condensation of a portion.\r\nThis initial condensation is seldom less than from 20 to 30 per cent of\r\nthe total weight of steam entering the cylinder. It is obvious that if\r\nthe steam entering be superheated, it must be reduced to the temperature\r\nof saturated steam at the corresponding pressure before any condensation\r\ncan take place. If the steam be superheated sufficiently to allow a\r\nreduction in temperature equivalent to the quantity of heat that must be\r\nimparted to the cylinder walls and still remain superheated, it is clear\r\nthat initial condensation is avoided. For example: assume one pound of\r\nsaturated steam at 200 pounds gauge pressure to enter a cylinder which\r\nhas been cooled by the exhaust. Assume the initial condensation to be 20\r\nper cent. The latent heat of the steam is given up in condensation;\r\nhence, .20 × 838 = 167.6 B. t. u. are given up by the steam. If one\r\npound of superheated steam enters the same cylinder, it would have to be\r\nsuperheated to a point where its total heat is 1199 + 168 = 1367\r\nB. t. u. or, at 200 pounds gauge pressure, superheated approximately 325\r\ndegrees if the heat given up to the cylinder walls were the same as for\r\nthe saturated steam. As superheated steam conducts heat less rapidly\r\nthan saturated steam, the amount of heat imparted will be less than for\r\nthe saturated steam and consequently the amount of superheat required to\r\nprevent condensation will be less than the above figure. This, of\r\ncourse, is the extreme case of a simple engine with the range of\r\ntemperature change a maximum. As cylinders are added, the range in each\r\nis decreased and the condensation is proportionate.\r\n\r\nThe true economy of the use of superheated steam is best shown in a\r\ncomparison of the \"heat consumption\" of an engine. This is the number of\r\nheat units required in developing one indicated horse power and the\r\nmeasure of the relative performance of two engines is based on a\r\ncomparison of their heat consumption as the measure of a boiler is based\r\non its evaporation from and at 212 degrees. The water consumption of an\r\nengine in pounds per indicated horse power is in no sense a true\r\nindication of its efficiency. The initial pressures and corresponding\r\ntemperatures may differ widely and thus make a difference in the\r\ntemperature of the exhaust and hence in the temperature of the condensed\r\nsteam returned to the boiler. For example: suppose a certain weight of\r\nsteam at 150 pounds absolute pressure and 358 degrees be expanded to\r\natmospheric pressure, the temperature then being 212 degrees. If the\r\nsame weight of steam be expanded from an initial pressure of 125 pounds\r\nabsolute and 344 degrees, to enable it to do the same amount of work,\r\nthat is, to give up the same amount of heat, expansion then must be\r\ncarried to a point below atmospheric pressure to, say, 13 pounds\r\nabsolute, the final temperature of the steam then being 206 degrees. In\r\nactual practice, it has been observed that the water consumption of a\r\ncompound piston engine running on 26-inch vacuum and returning the\r\ncondensed steam at 140 degrees was approximately the same as when\r\nrunning on 28-inch vacuum and returning water at 90 degrees. With an\r\nequal water consumption for the two sets of conditions, the economy in\r\nthe former case would be greater than in the latter, since it would be\r\nnecessary to add less heat to the water returned to the boiler to raise\r\nit to the steam temperature.\r\n\r\nThe lower the heat consumption of an engine per indicated horse power,\r\nthe higher its economy and the less the number of heat units must be\r\nimparted to the steam generated. This in turn leads to the lowering of\r\nthe amount of fuel that must be burned per indicated horse power.\r\n\r\nWith the saving in fuel by the reduction of heat consumption of an\r\nengine indicated, it remains to be shown the effect of the use of\r\nsuperheated steam on such heat consumption. As already explained, the\r\nuse of superheated steam reduces condensation not only in the mains but\r\nespecially in the steam cylinder, leaving a greater quantity of steam\r\navailable to do the work. Furthermore, a portion of the saturated steam\r\nintroduced into a cylinder will condense during adiabatic expansion,\r\nthis condensation increasing as expansion progresses. Since superheated\r\nsteam cannot condense until it becomes saturated, not only is initial\r\ncondensation prevented by its use but also such condensation as would\r\noccur during expansion. When superheated sufficiently, steam delivered\r\nby the exhaust will still be dry. In the avoidance of such condensation,\r\nthere is a direct saving in the heat consumption of an engine, the heat\r\ngiven up being utilized in the developing of power and not in changing\r\nthe condition of the working fluid. That is, while the number of heat\r\nunits lost in overcoming condensation effects would be the same in\r\neither case, when saturated steam is condensed the water of condensation\r\nhas no power to do work while the superheated steam, even after it has\r\nlost a like number of heat units, still has the power of expansion. The\r\nsaving through the use of superheated steam in the heat consumption of\r\nan engine decreases demands on the boiler and hence the fuel consumption\r\nper unit of power.\r\n\r\nSuperheated Steam for Steam Turbines--Experience in using superheated\r\nsteam in connection with steam turbines has shown that it leads to\r\neconomy and that it undoubtedly pays to use superheated steam in place\r\nof saturated steam. This is so well established that it is standard\r\npractice to use superheated steam in connection with steam turbines.\r\nAside from the economy secured through using superheated steam, there is\r\nan important advantage arising through the fact that it materially\r\nreduces the erosion of the turbine blades by the action of water that\r\nwould be carried by saturated steam. In using saturated steam in a steam\r\nturbine or piston engine, the work done on expanding the steam causes\r\ncondensation of a portion of the steam, so that even were the steam dry\r\non entering the turbine, it would contain water on leaving the turbine.\r\nBy superheating the steam the water that exists in the low pressure\r\nstages of the turbine may be reduced to an amount that will not cause\r\ntrouble.\r\n\r\nAgain, if saturated steam contains moisture, the effect of this moisture\r\non the economy of a steam turbine is to reduce the economy to a greater\r\nextent than the proportion by weight of water, one per cent of water\r\ncausing approximately a falling off of 2 per cent in the economy.\r\n\r\nThe water rate of a large economical steam turbine with superheated\r\nsteam is reduced about one per cent, for every 12 degrees of superheat\r\nup to 200 degrees Fahrenheit of superheat. To superheat one pound of\r\nsteam 12 degrees requires about 7 B. t. u. and if 1050 B. t. u. are\r\nrequired at the boiler to evaporate one pound of the saturated steam\r\nfrom the temperature of the feed water, the heat required for the\r\nsuperheated steam would be 1057 degrees. One per cent of saving,\r\ntherefore, in the water consumption would correspond to a net saving of\r\nabout one-third of one per cent in the coal consumption. On this basis\r\n100 degrees of superheat with an economical steam turbine would result\r\nin somewhat over 3 per cent of saving in the coal for equal boiler\r\nefficiencies. As a boiler with a properly designed superheater placed\r\nwithin the setting is more economical for a given capacity than a boiler\r\nwithout a superheater, the minimum gain in the coal consumption would\r\nbe, say, 4 or 5 per cent as compared to a plant with the same boilers\r\nwithout superheaters.\r\n\r\nThe above estimates are on the basis of a thoroughly dry saturated steam\r\nor steam just at the point of being superheated or containing a few\r\ndegrees of superheat. If the saturated steam is moist, the saving due to\r\nsuperheat is more and ordinarily the gain in economy due to superheated\r\nsteam, for equal boiler efficiencies, as compared with commercially dry\r\nsteam is, say, 5 per cent for each 100 degrees of superheat. Aside from\r\nthis gain, as already stated, superheated steam prevents erosion of the\r\nturbine buckets that would be caused by water in the steam, and for the\r\nreasons enumerated it is standard practice to use superheated steam for\r\nturbine work. The less economical the steam motor, the more the gain due\r\nto superheated steam, and where there are a number of auxiliaries that\r\nare run with superheated steam, the percentage of gain will be greater\r\nthan the figures given above, which are the minimum and are for the most\r\neconomical type of large steam turbines.\r\n\r\nAn example from actual practice will perhaps best illustrate and\r\nemphasize the foregoing facts. In October 1909, a series of comparable\r\ntests were conducted by The Babcock & Wilcox Co. on the steam yacht\r\n\"Idalia\" to determine the steam consumption both with saturated and\r\nsuperheated steam of the main engine on that yacht, including as well\r\nthe feed pump, circulating pump and air pump. These tests are more\r\nrepresentative than are most tests of like character in that the saving\r\nin the steam consumption of the auxiliaries, which were much more\r\nwasteful than the main engine, formed an important factor. A résumé of\r\nthese tests was published in the Journal of the Society of Naval\r\nEngineers, November 1909.\r\n\r\nThe main engines of the \"Idalia\" are four cylinder, triple expansion,\r\n11-1/2 × 19 inches by 22-11/16 × 18 inches stroke. Steam is supplied by\r\na Babcock & Wilcox marine boiler having 2500 square feet of boiler\r\nheating surface, 340 square feet of superheating surface and 65 square\r\nfeet of grate surface.\r\n\r\nThe auxiliaries consist of a feed pump 6 × 4 × 6 inches, an independent\r\nair pump 6 × 12 × 8 inches, and a centrifugal pump driven by a\r\nreciprocating engine 5-7/16 × 5 inches. Under ordinary operating\r\nconditions the superheat existing is about 100 degrees Fahrenheit.\r\n\r\nTests were made with various degrees of superheat, the amount being\r\nvaried by by-passing the gases and in the tests with the lower amounts\r\nof superheat by passing a portion of the steam from the boiler to the\r\nsteam main without passing it through the superheater. Steam temperature\r\nreadings were taken at the engine throttle. In the tests with saturated\r\nsteam, the superheater was completely cut out of the system. Careful\r\ncalorimeter measurements were taken, showing that the saturated steam\r\ndelivered to the superheater was dry.\r\n\r\nThe weight of steam used was determined from the weight of the condensed\r\nsteam discharge from the surface condenser, the water being pumped from\r\nthe hot well into a tank mounted on platform scales. The same\r\nindicators, thermometers and gauges were used in all the tests, so that\r\nthe results are directly comparable. The indicators used were of the\r\noutside spring type so that there was no effect of the temperature of\r\nthe steam. All tests were of sufficient duration to show a uniformity of\r\nresults by hours. A summary of the results secured is given in Table 26,\r\nwhich shows the water rate per indicated horse power and the heat\r\nconsumption. The latter figures are computed on the basis of the heat\r\nimparted to the steam above the actual temperature of the feed water\r\nand, as stated, these are the results that are directly comparable.\r\n\r\n                                TABLE 26\r\n\r\n                        RESULTS OF \"IDALIA\" TESTS\r\n _______________________________________________________________________\r\n|                               |       |       |       |       |       |\r\n|Date                    1909   |Oct. 11|Oct. 14|Oct. 14|Oct. 12|Oct. 13|\r\n|_______________________________|_______|_______|_______|_______|_______|\r\n|Degrees of superheat Fahrenheit|   0   |  57   |  88   |  96   | 105   |\r\n|Pressures, pounds per} Throttle| 190   | 196   | 201   | 198   | 203   |\r\n|square inch above    } First   |       |       |       |       |       |\r\n|Atmospheric Pressure } Receiver|  68.4 |  66.0 |  64.3 |  61.9 |  63.0 |\r\n|                     } Second  |       |       |       |       |       |\r\n|                     } Receiver|   9.7 |   9.2 |   8.7 |   7.8 |   8.4 |\r\n|Vacuum, inches                 |  25.5 |  25.9 |  25.9 |  25.4 |  25.2 |\r\n|Temperature, Degrees Fahrenheit|       |       |       |       |       |\r\n|                } Feed         | 201   | 206   | 205   | 202   | 200   |\r\n|                } Hot Well     | 116   | 109.5 | 115   | 111.5 | 111   |\r\n|                               |       |       |       |       |       |\r\n|Revolutions per minute         |       |       |       |       |       |\r\n|              {Air Pump        |  57   |  56   |  53   |  54   |  45   |\r\n|              {Circulating Pump| 196   | 198   | 196   | 198   | 197   |\r\n|              {Main Engine     | 194.3 | 191.5 | 195.1 | 191.5 | 193.1 |\r\n|Indicated Horse Power,         |       |       |       |       |       |\r\n|           Main Engine         | 512.3 | 495.2 | 521.1 | 498.3 | 502.2 |\r\n|Water per hour, total pounds   |9397   |8430   |8234   |7902   |7790   |\r\n|Water per indicated            |       |       |       |       |       |\r\n|        Horse Power, pounds    |  18.3 |  17.0 |  15.8 |  15.8 |  15.5 |\r\n|B. t. u. per minute per        |       |       |       |       |       |\r\n|        indicated Horse Power  | 314   | 300   | 284   | 286   | 283   |\r\n|Per cent Saving of Steam       | ...   |   7.1 |  13.7 |  13.7 |  15.3 |\r\n|Percent Saving of Fuel         |       |       |       |       |       |\r\n|               (computed)      | ...   |   4.4 |   9.5 |   8.9 |   9.9 |\r\n|_______________________________|_______|_______|_______|_______|_______|\r\n\r\nThe table shows that the saving in steam consumption with 105 degrees of\r\nsuperheat was 15.3 per cent and in heat consumption about 10 per cent.\r\nThis may be safely stated to be a conservative representation of the\r\nsaving that may be accomplished by the use of superheated steam in a\r\nplant as a whole, where superheated steam is furnished not only to the\r\nmain engine but also to the auxiliaries. The figures may be taken as\r\nconservative for the reason that in addition to the saving as shown in\r\nthe table, there would be in an ordinary plant a saving much greater\r\nthan is generally realized in the drips, where the loss with saturated\r\nsteam is greatly in excess of that with superheated steam.\r\n\r\nThe most conclusive and most practical evidence that a saving is\r\npossible through the use of superheated steam is in the fact that in the\r\nlargest and most economical plants it is used almost without exception.\r\nRegardless of any such evidence, however, there is a deep rooted\r\nconviction in the minds of certain engineers that the use of superheated\r\nsteam will involve operating difficulties which, with additional first\r\ncost, will more than offset any fuel saving. There are, of course,\r\nconditions under which the installation of superheaters would in no way\r\nbe advisable. With a poorly designed superheater, no gain would result.\r\nIn general, it may be stated that in a new plant, properly designed,\r\nwith a boiler and superheater which will have an efficiency at least as\r\nhigh as a boiler without a superheater, a gain is certain.\r\n\r\nSuch a gain is dependent upon the class of engine and the power plant\r\nequipment in general. In determining the advisability of making a\r\nsuperheater installation, all of the factors entering into each\r\nindividual case should be considered and balanced, with a view to\r\ndetermining the saving in relation to cost, maintenance, depreciation\r\netc.\r\n\r\nIn highly economical plants, where the water consumption for an\r\nindicated horse power is low, the gain will be less than would result\r\nfrom the use of superheated steam in less economical plants where the\r\nwater consumption is higher. It is impossible to make an accurate\r\nstatement as to the saving possible but, broadly, it may vary from 3 to\r\n5 per cent for 100 degrees of superheat in the large and economical\r\nplants using turbines or steam engines, in which there is a large ratio\r\nof expansion, to from 10 to 25 per cent for 100 degrees of superheat for\r\nthe less economical steam motors.\r\n\r\nThough a properly designed superheater will tend to raise rather than to\r\ndecrease the boiler efficiency, it does not follow that all superheaters\r\nare efficient, for if the gases in passing over the superheater do not\r\nfollow the path they would ordinarily take in passing over the boiler\r\nheating surface, a loss may result. This is noticeably true where part of\r\nthe gases are passed over the superheater and are allowed to pass over\r\nonly a part or in some cases none of the boiler heating surface.\r\n\r\nWith moderate degrees of superheat, from 100 to 200 degrees, where the\r\npiping is properly installed, there will be no greater operating\r\ndifficulties than with saturated steam. Engine and turbine builders\r\nguarantee satisfactory operation with superheated steam. With high\r\ndegrees of superheat, say, over 250 degrees, apparatus of a special\r\nnature must be used and it is questionable whether the additional care\r\nand liability to operating difficulties will offset any fuel saving\r\naccomplished. It is well established, however, that the operating\r\ndifficulties, with the degrees of superheat to which this article is\r\nlimited, have been entirely overcome.\r\n\r\nThe use of cast-iron fittings with superheated steam has been widely\r\ndiscussed. It is an undoubted fact that while in some instances\r\nsuperheated steam has caused deterioration of such fittings, in others\r\ncast-iron fittings have been used with 150 degrees of superheat without\r\nthe least difficulty. The quality of the cast iron used in such fittings\r\nhas doubtless a large bearing on the life of such fittings for this\r\nservice. The difficulties that have been encountered are an increase in\r\nthe size of the fittings and eventually a deterioration great enough to\r\nlead to serious breakage, the development of cracks, and when flanges\r\nare drawn up too tightly, the breaking of a flange from the body of the\r\nfitting. The latter difficulty is undoubtedly due, in certain instances,\r\nto the form of flange in which the strain of the connecting bolts tended\r\nto distort the metal.\r\n\r\nThe Babcock & Wilcox Co. have used steel castings in superheated steam\r\nwork over a long period and experience has shown that this metal is\r\nsuitable for the service. There seems to be a general tendency toward\r\nthe use of steel fittings. In European practice, until recently, cast\r\niron was used with apparently satisfactory results. The claim of\r\nEuropean engineers was to the effect that their cast iron was of better\r\nquality than that found in this country and thus explained the results\r\nsecured. Recently, however, certain difficulties have been encountered\r\nwith such fittings and European engineers are leaning toward the use of\r\nsteel for this work.\r\n\r\nThe degree of superheat produced by a superheater placed within the\r\nboiler setting will vary according to the class of fuel used, the form\r\nof furnace, the condition of the fire and the rate at which the boiler\r\nis being operated. This is necessarily true of any superheater swept by\r\nthe main body of the products of combustion and is a fact that should be\r\nappreciated by the prospective user of superheated steam. With a\r\nproperly designed superheater, however, such fluctuations would not be\r\nexcessive, provided the boilers are properly operated. As a matter of\r\nfact the point to be guarded against in the use of superheated steam is\r\nthat a maximum should not be exceeded. While, as stated, there may be a\r\nconsiderable fluctuation in the temperature of the steam as delivered\r\nfrom individual superheaters, where there are a number of boilers on a\r\nline the temperature of the combined flow of steam in the main will be\r\nfound to be practically a constant, resulting from the offsetting of\r\nvarious furnace conditions of one boiler by another.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 8400 Horse-power Installation of Babcock & Wilcox Boilers\r\nand Superheaters at the Butler Street Plant of the Georgia Railway and\r\nPower Co., Atlanta, Ga.

While different\r\nauthorities give slightly varying values for the proportion of oxygen\r\nand nitrogen contained, the generally accepted values are:\r\n\r\n    By volume, oxygen 20.91 per cent, nitrogen 79.09 per cent.\r\n    By weight, oxygen 23.15 per cent, nitrogen 76.85 per cent.\r\n\r\nAir in nature always contains other constituents in varying amounts,\r\nsuch as dust, carbon dioxide, ozone and water vapor.\r\n\r\nBeing perfectly elastic, the density or weight per unit of volume\r\ndecreases in geometric progression with the altitude. This fact has a\r\ndirect bearing in the proportioning of furnaces, flues and stacks at\r\nhigh altitudes, as will be shown later in the discussion of these\r\nsubjects. The atmospheric pressures corresponding to various altitudes\r\nare given in Table 12.\r\n\r\nThe weight and volume of air depend upon the pressure and the\r\ntemperature, as expressed by the formula:\r\n\r\nPv = 53.33 T      (9)\r\n\r\nWhere P = the absolute pressure in pounds per square foot,\r\n      v = the volume in cubic feet of one pound of air,\r\n      T = the absolute temperature of the air in degrees Fahrenheit,\r\n  53.33 = a constant for air derived from the ratio of pressure, volume\r\n          and temperature of a perfect gas.\r\n\r\nThe weight of one cubic foot of air will obviously be the reciprocal of\r\nits volume, that is, 1/v pounds.\r\n\r\n                 TABLE 27\r\n\r\n         VOLUME AND WEIGHT OF AIR\r\n         AT ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE\r\n         AT VARIOUS TEMPERATURES\r\n _______________________________________\r\n|             |            |            |\r\n|             |   Volume   |            |\r\n| Temperature | One Pound  | Weight One |\r\n|  Degrees    |     in     | Cubic Foot |\r\n| Fahrenheit  | Cubic Feet | in Pounds  |\r\n|_____________|____________|____________|\r\n|             |            |            |\r\n|      32     |   12.390   |  .080710   |\r\n|      50     |   12.843   |  .077863   |\r\n|      55     |   12.969   |  .077107   |\r\n|      60     |   13.095   |  .076365   |\r\n|      65     |   13.221   |  .075637   |\r\n|      70     |   13.347   |  .074923   |\r\n|      75     |   13.473   |  .074223   |\r\n|      80     |   13.599   |  .073535   |\r\n|      85     |   13.725   |  .072860   |\r\n|      90     |   13.851   |  .072197   |\r\n|      95     |   13.977   |  .071546   |\r\n|     100     |   14.103   |  .070907   |\r\n|     110     |   14.355   |  .069662   |\r\n|     120     |   14.607   |  .068460   |\r\n|     130     |   14.859   |  .067299   |\r\n|     140     |   15.111   |  .066177   |\r\n|     150     |   15.363   |  .065092   |\r\n|     160     |   15.615   |  .064041   |\r\n|     170     |   15.867   |  .063024   |\r\n|     180     |   16.119   |  .062039   |\r\n|     190     |   16.371   |  .061084   |\r\n|     200     |   16.623   |  .060158   |\r\n|     210     |   16.875   |  .059259   |\r\n|     212     |   16.925   |  .059084   |\r\n|     220     |   17.127   |  .058388   |\r\n|     230     |   17.379   |  .057541   |\r\n|     240     |   17.631   |  .056718   |\r\n|     250     |   17.883   |  .055919   |\r\n|     260     |   18.135   |  .055142   |\r\n|     270     |   18.387   |  .054386   |\r\n|     280     |   18.639   |  .053651   |\r\n|     290     |   18.891   |  .052935   |\r\n|     300     |   19.143   |  .052238   |\r\n|     320     |   19.647   |  .050898   |\r\n|     340     |   20.151   |  .049625   |\r\n|     360     |   20.655   |  .048414   |\r\n|     380     |   21.159   |  .047261   |\r\n|     400     |   21.663   |  .046162   |\r\n|     425     |   22.293   |  .044857   |\r\n|     450     |   22.923   |  .043624   |\r\n|     475     |   23.554   |  .042456   |\r\n|     500     |   24.184   |  .041350   |\r\n|     525     |   24.814   |  .040300   |\r\n|     550     |   25.444   |  .039302   |\r\n|     575     |   26.074   |  .038352   |\r\n|     600     |   26.704   |  .037448   |\r\n|     650     |   27.964   |  .035760   |\r\n|     700     |   29.224   |  .034219   |\r\n|     750     |   30.484   |  .032804   |\r\n|     800     |   31.744   |  .031502   |\r\n|     850     |   33.004   |  .030299   |\r\n|_____________|____________|____________|\r\n\r\nExample: Required the volume of air in cubic feet under 60.3 pounds\r\ngauge pressure per square inch at 115 degrees Fahrenheit.\r\n\r\nP = 144 (14.7 + 60.3) = 10,800.\r\n\r\nT = 115 + 460 = 575 degrees.\r\n\r\n          53.33 × 575\r\nHence v = ----------- = 2.84 cubic feet, and\r\n            10,800\r\n\r\n                        1    1\r\nWeight per cubic foot = - = ---- = 0.352 pounds.\r\n                        v   2.84\r\n\r\nTable 27 gives the weights and volumes of air under atmospheric pressure\r\nat varying temperatures.\r\n\r\nFormula (9) holds good for other gases with the change in the value of\r\nthe constant as follows:\r\n\r\nFor oxygen 48.24, nitrogen 54.97, hydrogen 765.71.\r\n\r\nThe specific heat of air at constant pressure varies with its\r\ntemperature.

All things considered in view of the discrepancy of\r\nthe values given, there appears to be as much ground for the use of a\r\nconstant value for the specific heat of air at any temperature as for a\r\nvariable value.

That portion of the substance thus combined with the oxygen\r\nis called combustible. As used in steam engineering practice, however,\r\nthe term combustible is applied to that portion of the fuel which is dry\r\nand free from ash, thus including both oxygen and nitrogen which may be\r\nconstituents of the fuel, though not in the true sense of the term\r\ncombustible.\r\n\r\nCombustion is perfect when the combustible unites with the greatest\r\npossible amount of oxygen, as when one atom of carbon unites with two\r\natoms of oxygen to form carbon dioxide, CO_{2}. The combustion is\r\nimperfect when complete oxidation of the combustible does not occur, or\r\nwhere the combustible does not unite with the maximum amount of oxygen,\r\nas when one atom of carbon unites with one atom of oxygen to form carbon\r\nmonoxide, CO, which may be further burned to carbon dioxide.\r\n\r\nKindling Point--Before a combustible can unite with oxygen and\r\ncombustion takes place, its temperature must first be raised to the\r\nignition or kindling point, and a sufficient time must be allowed for\r\nthe completion of the combustion before the temperature of the gases is\r\nlowered below that point. Table 30, by Stromeyer, gives the approximate\r\nkindling temperatures of different fuels.\r\n\r\n               TABLE 30\r\n\r\nKINDLING TEMPERATURE OF VARIOUS FUELS\r\n\r\n ____________________________________\r\n|                 |                  |\r\n|                 |   Degrees        |\r\n|                 |   Fahrenheit     |\r\n|_________________|__________________|\r\n|                 |                  |\r\n| Lignite Dust    |   300            |\r\n| Dried Peat      |   435            |\r\n| Sulphur         |   470            |\r\n| Anthracite Dust |   570            |\r\n| Coal            |   600            |\r\n| Coke            |   Red Heat       |\r\n| Anthracite      |   Red Heat, 750  |\r\n| Carbon Monoxide |   Red Heat, 1211 |\r\n| Hydrogen        |   1030 or 1290   |\r\n|_________________|__________________|\r\n\r\n\r\nCombustibles--The principal combustibles in coal and other fuels are\r\ncarbon, hydrogen and sulphur, occurring in varying proportions and\r\ncombinations.\r\n\r\nCarbon is by far the most abundant as is indicated in the chapters on\r\nfuels.\r\n\r\nHydrogen in a free state occurs in small quantities in some fuels, but\r\nis usually found in combination with carbon, in the form of\r\nhydrocarbons. The density of hydrogen is 0.0696 (Air = 1) and its weight\r\nper cubic foot, at 32 degrees Fahrenheit and under atmospheric pressure,\r\nis 0.005621 pounds.\r\n\r\nSulphur is found in most coals and some oils. It is usually present in\r\ncombined form, either as sulphide of iron or sulphate of lime; in the\r\nlatter form it has no heat value. Its presence in fuel is objectionable\r\nbecause of its tendency to aid in the formation of clinkers, and the\r\ngases from its combustion, when in the presence of moisture, may cause\r\ncorrosion.\r\n\r\nNitrogen is drawn into the furnace with the air. Its density is 0.9673\r\n(Air = 1); its weight, at 32 degrees Fahrenheit and under atmospheric\r\npressure, is 0.07829 pounds per cubic foot; each pound of air at\r\natmospheric pressure contains 0.7685 pounds of nitrogen, and one pound\r\nof nitrogen is contained in 1.301 pounds of air.\r\n\r\nNitrogen performs no useful office in combustion and passes through the\r\nfurnace without change. It dilutes the air, absorbs heat, reduces the\r\ntemperature of the products of combustion, and is the chief source of\r\nheat losses in furnaces.\r\n\r\nCalorific Value--Each combustible element of gas will combine with\r\noxygen in certain definite proportions and will generate a definite\r\namount of heat, measured in B. t. u. This definite amount of heat per\r\npound liberated by perfect combustion is termed the calorific value of\r\nthat substance. Table 31, gives certain data on the reactions and\r\nresults of combustion for elementary combustibles and several compounds.\r\n\r\n                                 TABLE 31\r\n\r\n

dioxide, and will evolve 14,600\r\nB. t. u. As an intermediate step, a pound of carbon may unite with 1-1/3\r\npounds of oxygen to form carbon monoxide and evolve 4450 B. t. u., but\r\nin its further conversion to CO_{2} it would unite with an additional\r\n1-1/3 times its weight of oxygen and evolve the remaining 10,150\r\nB. t. u. When a pound of CO burns to CO_{2}, however, only 4350 B. t. u.\r\nare evolved since the pound of CO contains but 3/7 pound carbon.\r\n\r\nAir Required for Combustion--It has already been shown that each\r\ncombustible element in fuel will unite with a definite amount of oxygen.\r\nWith the ultimate analysis of the fuel known, in connection with Table\r\n31, the theoretical amount of air required for combustion may be readily\r\ncalculated.\r\n\r\nLet the ultimate analysis be as follows:\r\n\r\n              _Per Cent_\r\nCarbon          74.79\r\nHydrogen         4.98\r\nOxygen           6.42\r\nNitrogen         1.20\r\nSulphur          3.24\r\nWater            1.55\r\nAsh              7.82\r\n               ------\r\n               100.00\r\n\r\nWhen complete combustion takes place, as already pointed out, the carbon\r\nin the fuel unites with a definite amount of oxygen to form CO_{2}. The\r\nhydrogen, either in a free or combined state, will unite with oxygen to\r\nform water vapor, H_{2}O. Not all of the hydrogen shown in a fuel\r\nanalysis, however, is available for the production of heat, as a portion\r\nof it is already united with the oxygen shown by the analysis in the\r\nform of water, H_{2}O. Since the atomic weights of H and O are\r\nrespectively 1 and 16, the weight of the combined hydrogen will be 1/8\r\nof the weight of the oxygen, and the hydrogen available for combustion\r\nwill be H - 1/8 O. In complete combustion of the sulphur, sulphur\r\ndioxide SO_{2} is formed, which in solution in water forms sulphuric\r\nacid.\r\n\r\nExpressed numerically, the theoretical amount of air for the above\r\nanalysis is as follows:\r\n\r\n  0.7479 C × 2-2/3         = 1.9944 O needed\r\n(           0.0642 )\r\n( 0.0498 -  -------) H × 8 = 0.3262 O needed\r\n(              8   )\r\n  0.0324 S × 1             = 0.0324 O needed\r\n                             ------\r\n                    Total    2.3530 O needed\r\n\r\nOne pound of oxygen is contained in 4.32 pounds of air.\r\n\r\nThe total air needed per pound of coal, therefore, will be 2.353 × 4.32\r\n= 10.165.\r\n\r\nThe weight of combustible per pound of fuel is .7479 + .0418[27] + .0324\r\n+ .012 = .83 pounds, and the air theoretically required per pound of\r\ncombustible is 10.165 ÷ .83 = 12.2 pounds.\r\n\r\nThe above is equivalent to computing the theoretical amount of air\r\nrequired per pound of fuel by the formula:\r\n\r\n                                   (    O)\r\nWeight per pound = 11.52 C + 34.56 (H - -) + 4.32 S      (10)\r\n                                   (    8)\r\n\r\nwhere C, H, O and S are proportional parts by weight of carbon,\r\nhydrogen, oxygen and sulphur by ultimate analysis.\r\n\r\nIn practice it is impossible to obtain perfect combustion with the\r\ntheoretical amount of air, and an excess may be required, amounting to\r\nsometimes double the theoretical supply, depending upon the nature of\r\nthe fuel to be burned and the method of burning it. The reason for this\r\nis that it is impossible to bring each particle of oxygen in the air\r\ninto intimate contact with the particles in the fuel that are to be\r\noxidized, due not only to the dilution of the oxygen in the air by\r\nnitrogen, but because of such factors as the irregular thickness of the\r\nfire, the varying resistance to the passage of the air through the fire\r\nin separate parts on account of ash, clinker, etc. Where the\r\ndifficulties of drawing air uniformly through a fuel bed are eliminated,\r\nas in the case of burning oil fuel or gas, the air supply may be\r\nmaterially less than would be required for coal. Experiment has shown\r\nthat coal will usually require 50 per cent more than the theoretical net\r\ncalculated amount of air, or about 18 pounds per pound of fuel either\r\nunder natural or forced draft, though this amount may vary widely with\r\nthe type of furnace, the nature of the coal, and the method of firing.\r\nIf less than this amount of air is supplied, the carbon burns to\r\nmonoxide instead of dioxide and its full heat value is not developed.\r\n\r\nAn excess of air is also a source of waste, as the products of\r\ncombustion will be diluted and carry off an excessive amount of heat in\r\nthe chimney gases, or the air will so lower the temperature of the\r\nfurnace gases as to delay the combustion to an extent that will cause\r\ncarbon monoxide to pass off unburned from the furnace. A sufficient\r\namount of carbon monoxide in the gases may cause the action known as\r\nsecondary combustion, by igniting or mingling with air after leaving the\r\nfurnace or in the flues or stack. Such secondary combustion which takes\r\nplace either within the setting after leaving the furnace or in the\r\nflues or stack always leads to a loss of efficiency and, in some\r\ninstances, leads to overheating of the flues and stack.\r\n\r\nTable 32 gives the theoretical amount of air required for various fuels\r\ncalculated from formula (10) assuming the analyses of the fuels given in\r\nthe table.\r\n\r\nThe process of combustion of different fuels and the effect of variation\r\nin the air supply for their combustion is treated in detail in the\r\nchapters dealing with the various fuels.\r\n\r\n                           TABLE 32\r\n\r\n             CALCULATED THEORETICAL AMOUNT OF AIR\r\n             REQUIRED PER POUND OF VARIOUS FUELS\r\n\r\n ____________________________________________________________\r\n|                |Weight of Constituents in One |Air Required|\r\n|     Fuel       |Pound Dry Fuel                |per Pound   |\r\n|                |______________________________|of Fuel     |\r\n|                | Carbon  | Hydrogen| Oxygen   |Pounds      |\r\n|                | Per Cent| Per Cent| Per Cent |            |\r\n|________________|_________|_________|__________|____________|\r\n|Coke            |  94.0   |    .    |    .     |  10.8      |\r\n|Anthracite Coal |  91.5   |   3.5   |   2.6    |  11.7      |\r\n|Bituminous Coal |  87.0   |   5.0   |   4.0    |  11.6      |\r\n|Lignite         |  70.0   |   5.0   |  20.0    |   8.9      |\r\n|Wood            |  50.0   |   6.0   |  43.5    |   6.0      |\r\n|Oil             |  85.0   |  13.0   |   1.0    |  14.3      |\r\n|________________|_________|_________|__________|____________|\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 4064 HORSE-POWER Installation of Babcock & Wilcox Boilers\r\nand Superheaters, Equipped with Babcock & Wilcox Chain Grate Stokers, at\r\nthe Cosmopolitan Electric Co., Chicago, Ill.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANALYSIS OF FLUE GASES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe object of a flue gas analysis is the determination of the\r\ncompleteness of the combustion of the carbon in the fuel, and the amount\r\nand distribution of the heat losses due to incomplete combustion. The\r\nquantities actually determined by an analysis are the relative\r\nproportions by volume, of carbon dioxide (CO_{2}), oxygen (O), and\r\ncarbon monoxide (CO), the determinations being made in this order.\r\n\r\nThe variations of the percentages of these gases in an analysis is best\r\nillustrated in the consideration of the complete combustion of pure\r\ncarbon, a pound of which requires 2.67 pounds of oxygen,[28] or 32 cubic\r\nfeet at 60 degrees Fahrenheit. The gaseous product of such combustion\r\nwill occupy, when cooled, the same volume as the oxygen, namely, 32\r\ncubic feet. The air supplied for the combustion is made up of 20.91 per\r\ncent oxygen and 79.09 per cent nitrogen by volume. The carbon united\r\nwith the oxygen in the form of carbon dioxide will have the same volume\r\nas the oxygen in the air originally supplied. The volume of the nitrogen\r\nwhen cooled will be the same as in the air supplied, as it undergoes no\r\nchange. Hence for complete combustion of one pound of carbon, where no\r\nexcess of air is supplied, an analysis of the products of combustion\r\nwill show the following percentages by volume:\r\n\r\n                             _Actual Volume_\r\n                          _for One Pound Carbon_      _Per Cent_\r\n                               _Cubic Feet_           _by Volume_\r\nCarbon Dioxide                      32          =        20.91\r\nOxygen                               0          =         0.00\r\nNitrogen                           121          =        79.09\r\n                                   ---                  ------\r\nAir required for one pound Carbon  153          =       100.00\r\n\r\nFor 50 per cent excess air the volume will be as follows:\r\n\r\n    153 × 1½ = 229.5 cubic feet of air per pound of carbon.\r\n\r\n               _Actual Volume_\r\n            _for One Pound Carbon_    _Per Cent_\r\n                 _Cubic Feet_         _by Volume_\r\nCarbon Dioxide        32          =      13.91 }\r\nOxygen                16          =       7.00 } = 20.91 per cent\r\nNitrogen             181.5        =      79.09\r\n                     -----              ------\r\n                     229.5        =     100.00\r\n\r\nFor 100 per cent excess air the volume will be as follows:\r\n\r\n    153 × 2 = 306 cubic feet of air per pound of carbon.\r\n\r\n                _Actual Volume_\r\n             _for One Pound Carbon_    _Per Cent_\r\n                  _Cubic Feet_         _by Volume_\r\nCarbon Dioxide         32          =      10.45 }\r\nOxygen                 32          =      10.45 } = 20.91 per cent\r\nNitrogen              242          =      79.09\r\n                      ---                ------\r\n                      306          =     100.00\r\n\r\nIn each case the volume of oxygen which combines with the carbon is\r\nequal to (cubic feet of air × 20.91 per cent)--32 cubic feet.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that no matter what the excess of air supplied, the\r\nactual amount of carbon dioxide per pound of carbon remains the same,\r\nwhile the percentage by volume decreases as the excess of air increases.\r\nThe actual volume of oxygen and the percentage by volume increases with\r\nthe excess of air, and the percentage of oxygen is, therefore, an\r\nindication of the amount of excess air. In each case the sum of the\r\npercentages of CO_{2} and O is the same, 20.9. Although the volume of\r\nnitrogen increases with the excess of air, its percentage by volume\r\nremains the same as it undergoes no change while combustion takes place;\r\nits percentage for any amount of air excess, therefore, will be the same\r\nafter combustion as before, if cooled to the same temperature. It must\r\nbe borne in mind that the above conditions hold only for the perfect\r\ncombustion of a pound of pure carbon.\r\n\r\nCarbon monoxide (CO) produced by the imperfect combustion of carbon,\r\nwill occupy twice the volume of the oxygen entering into its composition\r\nand will increase the volume of the flue gases over that of the air\r\nsupplied for combustion in the proportion of\r\n\r\n     100 + ½ the per cent CO\r\n1 to -----------------------\r\n               100\r\n\r\nWhen pure carbon is the fuel, the sum of the percentages by volume of\r\ncarbon dioxide, oxygen and one-half of the carbon monoxide, must be in\r\nthe same ratio to the nitrogen in the flue gases as is the oxygen to the\r\nnitrogen in the air supplied, that is, 20.91 to 79.09. When burning\r\ncoal, however, the percentage of nitrogen is obtained by subtracting the\r\nsum of the percentages by volume of the other gases from 100. Thus if an\r\nanalysis shows 12.5 per cent CO_{2}, 6.5 per cent O, and 0.6 per cent\r\nCO, the percentage of nitrogen which ordinarily is the only other\r\nconstituent of the gas which need be considered, is found as follows:\r\n\r\n100 - (12.5 + 6.5 + 0.6) = 80.4 per cent.\r\n\r\nThe action of the hydrogen in the volatile constituents of the fuel is\r\nto increase the apparent percentage of the nitrogen in the flue gases.\r\nThis is due to the fact that the water vapor formed by the combustion of\r\nthe hydrogen will condense at a temperature at which the analysis is\r\nmade, while the nitrogen which accompanied the oxygen with which the\r\nhydrogen originally combined maintains its gaseous form and passes into\r\nthe sampling apparatus with the other gases. For this reason coals\r\ncontaining high percentages of volatile matter will produce a larger\r\nquantity of water vapor, and thus increase the apparent percentage of\r\nnitrogen.\r\n\r\n\r\nAir Required and Supplied--When the ultimate analysis of a fuel is\r\nknown, the air required for complete combustion with no excess can be\r\nfound as shown in the chapter on combustion, or from the following\r\napproximate formula:\r\n\r\n    Pounds of air required per pound of fuel =\r\n\r\n          (C        O    S)\r\n    34.56 (- + (H - -) + -)[29]      (11)\r\n          (3        8    8)\r\n\r\nwhere C, H and O equal the percentage by weight of carbon, hydrogen and\r\noxygen in the fuel divided by 100.\r\n\r\nWhen the flue gas analysis is known, the total, amount of air supplied\r\nis:\r\n\r\n    Pounds of air supplied per pound of fuel =\r\n\r\n                N\r\n    3.036 (-----------) × C[30]      (12)\r\n           CO_{2} + CO\r\n\r\nwhere N, CO_{2} and CO are the percentages by volume of nitrogen, carbon\r\ndioxide and carbon monoxide in the flue gases, and C the percentage by\r\nweight of carbon which is burned from the fuel and passes up the stack\r\nas flue gas. This percentage of C which is burned must be distinguished\r\nfrom the percentage of C as found by an ultimate analysis of the fuel.\r\nTo find the percentage of C which is burned, deduct from the total\r\npercentage of carbon as found in the ultimate analysis, the percentage\r\nof unconsumed carbon found in the ash. This latter quantity is the\r\ndifference between the percentage of ash found by an analysis and that\r\nas determined by a boiler test. It is usually assumed that the entire\r\ncombustible element in the ash is carbon, which assumption is\r\npractically correct. Thus if the ash in a boiler test were 16 per cent\r\nand by an analysis contained 25 per cent of carbon, the percentage of\r\nunconsumed carbon would be 16 × .25 = 4 per cent of the total coal\r\nburned. If the coal contained by ultimate analysis 80 per cent of carbon\r\nthe percentage burned, and of which the products of combustion pass up\r\nthe chimney would be 80 - 4 = 76 per cent, which is the correct figure\r\nto use in calculating the total amount of air supplied by formula (12).\r\n\r\nThe weight of flue gases resulting from the combustion of a pound of dry\r\ncoal will be the sum of the weights of the air per pound of coal and the\r\ncombustible per pound of coal, the latter being equal to one minus the\r\npercentage of ash as found in the boiler test. The weight of flue gases\r\nper pound of dry fuel may, however, be computed directly from the\r\nanalyses, as shown later, and the direct computation is that ordinarily\r\nused.\r\n\r\nThe ratio of the air actually supplied per pound of fuel to that\r\ntheoretically required to burn it is:\r\n\r\n          N\r\n3.036(---------)×C\r\n      CO_{2}+CO\r\n------------------      (13)\r\n      C       O\r\n34.56(- + H - -)\r\n      3       8\r\n\r\nin which the letters have the same significance as in formulae (11) and\r\n(12).\r\n\r\nThe ratio of the air supplied per pound of combustible to the amount\r\ntheoretically required is:\r\n\r\n         N\r\n------------------      (14)\r\nN - 3.782(O - ½CO)\r\n\r\nwhich is derived as follows:\r\n\r\nThe N in the flue gas is the content of nitrogen in the whole amount of\r\nair supplied. The oxygen in the flue gas is that contained in the air\r\nsupplied and which was not utilized in combustion. This oxygen was\r\naccompanied by 3.782 times its volume of nitrogen. The total amount of\r\nexcess oxygen in the flue gases is (O - ½CO); hence N - 3.782(O - ½CO)\r\nrepresents the nitrogen content in the air actually required for\r\ncombustion and N ÷ (N - 3.782[O - ½CO]) is the ratio of the air supplied\r\nto that required. This ratio minus one will be the proportion of excess\r\nair.\r\n\r\nThe heat lost in the flue gases is L = 0.24 W (T - t)      (15)\r\n\r\nWhere L = B. t. u. lost per pound of fuel,\r\n      W = weight of flue gases in pounds per pound of dry coal,\r\n      T = temperature of flue gases,\r\n      t = temperature of atmosphere,\r\n   0.24 = specific heat of the flue gases.\r\n\r\nThe weight of flue gases, W, per pound of carbon can be computed\r\ndirectly from the flue gas analysis from the formula:\r\n\r\n11 CO_{2} + 8 O + 7 (CO + N)\r\n----------------------------      (16)\r\n      3 (CO_{2} + CO)\r\n\r\nwhere CO_{2}, O, CO, and N are the percentages by volume as determined\r\nby the flue gas analysis of carbon dioxide, oxygen, carbon monoxide and\r\nnitrogen.\r\n\r\nThe weight of flue gas per pound of dry coal will be the weight\r\ndetermined by this formula multiplied by the percentage of carbon in the\r\ncoal from an ultimate analysis.\r\n\r\n[Graph: Temperature of Escaping Gases--Deg.

Loss Due to Unconsumed Carbon Contained in the\r\nCO in the Flue Gases]\r\n\r\nApparatus for Flue Gas Analysis--The Orsat apparatus, illustrated in\r\nFig. 22, is generally used for analyzing flue gases. The burette A is\r\ngraduated in cubic centimeters up to 100, and is surrounded by a water\r\njacket to prevent any change in temperature from affecting the density\r\nof the gas being analyzed.\r\n\r\nFor accurate work it is advisable to use four pipettes, B, C, D, E, the\r\nfirst containing a solution of caustic potash for the absorption of\r\ncarbon dioxide, the second an alkaline solution of pyrogallol for the\r\nabsorption of oxygen, and the remaining two an acid solution of cuprous\r\nchloride for absorbing the carbon monoxide. Each pipette contains a\r\nnumber of glass tubes, to which some of the solution clings, thus\r\nfacilitating the absorption of the gas. In the pipettes D and E, copper\r\nwire is placed in these tubes to re-energize the solution as it becomes\r\nweakened. The rear half of each pipette is fitted with a rubber bag, one\r\nof which is shown at K, to protect the solution from the action of the\r\nair. The solution in each pipette should be drawn up to the mark on the\r\ncapillary tube.\r\n\r\nThe gas is drawn into the burette through the U-tube H, which is filled\r\nwith spun glass, or similar material, to clean the gas. To discharge any\r\nair or gas in the apparatus, the cock G is opened to the air and the\r\nbottle F is raised until the water in the burette reaches the 100 cubic\r\ncentimeters mark. The cock G is then turned so as to close the air\r\nopening and allow gas to be drawn through H, the bottle F being lowered\r\nfor this purpose. The gas is drawn into the burette to a point below the\r\nzero mark, the cock G then being opened to the air and the excess gas\r\nexpelled until the level of the water in F and in A are at the zero\r\nmark. This operation is necessary in order to obtain the zero reading at\r\natmospheric pressure.\r\n\r\nThe apparatus should be carefully tested for leakage as well as all\r\nconnections leading thereto. Simple tests can be made; for example: If\r\nafter the cock G is closed, the bottle F is placed on top of the frame\r\nfor a short time and again brought to the zero mark, the level of the\r\nwater in A is above the zero mark, a leak is indicated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 22. Orsat Apparatus]\r\n\r\nBefore taking a final sample for analysis, the burette A should be\r\nfilled with gas and emptied once or twice, to make sure that all the\r\napparatus is filled with the new gas. The cock G is then closed and the\r\ncock I in the pipette B is opened and the gas driven over into B by\r\nraising the bottle F. The gas is drawn back into A by lowering F and\r\nwhen the solution in B has reached the mark in the capillary tube, the\r\ncock I is closed and a reading is taken on the burette, the level of the\r\nwater in the bottle F being brought to the same level as the water in A.\r\nThe operation is repeated until a constant reading is obtained, the\r\nnumber of cubic centimeters being the percentage of CO_{2} in the flue\r\ngases.\r\n\r\nThe gas is then driven over into the pipette C and a similar operation\r\nis carried out. The difference between the resulting reading and the\r\nfirst reading gives the percentage of oxygen in the flue gases.\r\n\r\nThe next operation is to drive the gas into the pipette D, the gas being\r\ngiven a final wash in E, and then passed into the pipette C to\r\nneutralize any hydrochloric acid fumes which may have been given off by\r\nthe cuprous chloride solution, which, especially if it be old, may give\r\noff such fumes, thus increasing the volume of the gases and making the\r\nreading on the burette less than the true amount.\r\n\r\nThe process must be carried out in the order named, as the pyrogallol\r\nsolution will also absorb carbon dioxide, while the cuprous chloride\r\nsolution will also absorb oxygen.\r\n\r\nAs the pressure of the gases in the flue is less than the atmospheric\r\npressure, they will not of themselves flow through the pipe connecting\r\nthe flue to the apparatus. The gas may be drawn into the pipe in the way\r\nalready described for filling the apparatus, but this is a tedious\r\nmethod. For rapid work a rubber bulb aspirator connected to the air\r\noutlet of the cock G will enable a new supply of gas to be drawn into\r\nthe pipe, the apparatus then being filled as already described. Another\r\nform of aspirator draws the gas from the flue in a constant stream, thus\r\ninsuring a fresh supply for each sample.\r\n\r\nThe analysis made by the Orsat apparatus is volumetric; if the analysis\r\nby weight is required, it can be found from the volumetric analysis as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nMultiply the percentages by volume by either the densities or the\r\nmolecular weight of each gas, and divide the products by the sum of all\r\nthe products; the quotients will be the percentages by weight. For most\r\nwork sufficient accuracy is secured by using the even values of the\r\nmolecular weights.\r\n\r\nThe even values of the molecular weights of the gases appearing in an\r\nanalysis by an Orsat are:\r\n\r\nCarbon Dioxide   44\r\nCarbon Monoxide  28\r\nOxygen           32\r\nNitrogen         28\r\n\r\nTable 33 indicates the method of converting a volumetric flue gas\r\nanalysis into an analysis by weight.\r\n\r\n                               TABLE 33\r\n\r\n     CONVERSION OF A FLUE GAS ANALYSIS BY VOLUME TO ONE BY WEIGHT\r\n\r\nColumn Headings:\r\n\r\nA: Analysis by Volume Per Cent\r\nB: Molecular Weight\r\nC: Volume times Molecular Weight\r\nD: Analysis by Weight Per Cent\r\n _____________________________________________________________________\r\n|                        |       |           |        |               |\r\n|          Gas           |   A   |     B     |   C    |       D       |\r\n|________________________|_______|___________|________|_______________|\r\n|                        |       |           |        |               |\r\n|                        |       |           |        |               |\r\n|                        |       |           |        | 536.8         |\r\n| Carbon Dioxide  CO_{2} |  12.2 | 12+(2×16) |  536.8 | ------ = 17.7 |\r\n|                        |       |           |        | 3022.8        |\r\n|                        |       |           |        |               |\r\n|                        |       |           |        |  11.2         |\r\n| Carbon Monoxide CO     |    .4 |   12+16   |   11.2 | ------ =   .4 |\r\n|                        |       |           |        | 3022.8        |\r\n|                        |       |           |        |               |\r\n|                        |       |           |        | 220.8         |\r\n| Oxygen          O      |   6.9 |    2×16   |  220.8 | ------ =  7.3 |\r\n|                        |       |           |        | 3022.8        |\r\n|                        |       |           |        |               |\r\n|                        |       |           |        | 2254.0        |\r\n| Nitrogen        N      |  80.5 |    2×14   | 2254.0 | ------ = 74.6 |\r\n|                        |       |           |        | 3022.8        |\r\n|________________________|_______|___________|________|_______________|\r\n|                        |       |           |        |               |\r\n| Total                  | 100.0 |           | 3022.8 |         100.0 |\r\n|________________________|_______|___________|________|_______________|\r\n\r\nApplication of Formulae and Rules--Pocahontas coal is burned in the\r\nfurnace, a partial ultimate analysis being:\r\n\r\n                       _Per Cent_\r\nCarbon                    82.1\r\nHydrogen                   4.25\r\nOxygen                     2.6\r\nSulphur                    1.6\r\nAsh                        6.0\r\nB. t. u., per pound dry  14500\r\n\r\nThe flue gas analysis shows:\r\n\r\n                _Per Cent_\r\n\r\nCO_{2}             10.7\r\nO                   9.0\r\nCO                  0.0\r\nN (by difference)  80.3\r\n\r\nDetermine: The flue gas analysis by weight (see Table 33), the amount of\r\nair required for perfect combustion, the actual weight of air per pound\r\nof fuel, the weight of flue gas per pound of coal, the heat lost in the\r\nchimney gases if the temperature of these is 500 degrees Fahrenheit, and\r\nthe ratio of the air supplied to that theoretically required.\r\n\r\nSolution: The theoretical weight of air required for perfect combustion,\r\nper pound of fuel, from formula (11) will be,\r\n\r\n          (.821            .026    .016)\r\nW = 34.56 (---- + (.0425 -

3.782(.09 - ½ × 0)\r\n\r\nThe ratio based on combustible will be greater than the ratio based on\r\nfuel if there is unconsumed carbon in the ash.\r\n\r\n\r\nUnreliability of CO_{2} Readings Taken Alone--It is generally assumed\r\nthat high CO_{2} readings are indicative of good combustion and hence of\r\nhigh efficiency. This is true only in the sense that such high readings\r\ndo indicate the small amount of excess air that usually accompanies good\r\ncombustion, and for this reason high CO_{2} readings alone are not\r\nconsidered entirely reliable. Wherever an automatic CO_{2} recorder is\r\nused, it should be checked from time to time and the analysis carried\r\nfurther with a view to ascertaining whether there is CO present. As the\r\npercentage of CO_{2} in these gases increases, there is a tendency\r\ntoward the presence of CO, which, of course, cannot be shown by a CO_{2}\r\nrecorder, and which is often difficult to detect with an Orsat\r\napparatus. The greatest care should be taken in preparing the cuprous\r\nchloride solution in making analyses and it must be known to be fresh\r\nand capable of absorbing CO. In one instance that came to our attention,\r\nin using an Orsat apparatus where the cuprous chloride solution was\r\nbelieved to be fresh, no CO was indicated in the flue gases but on\r\npassing the same sample into a Hempel apparatus, a considerable\r\npercentage was found. It is not safe, therefore, to assume without\r\nquestion from a high CO_{2} reading that the combustion is\r\ncorrespondingly good, and the question of excess air alone should be\r\ndistinguished from that of good combustion. The effect of a small\r\nquantity of CO, say one per cent, present in the flue gases will have a\r\nnegligible influence on the quantity of excess air, but the presence of\r\nsuch an amount would mean a loss due to the incomplete combustion of the\r\ncarbon in the fuel of possibly 4.5 per cent of the total heat in the\r\nfuel burned. When this is considered, the importance of a complete flue\r\ngas analysis is apparent.\r\n\r\nTable 34 gives the densities of various gases together with other data\r\nthat will be of service in gas analysis work.\r\n\r\n                              TABLE 34\r\n\r\n DENSITY OF GASES AT 32 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT AND ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE\r\n                   ADAPTED FROM SMITHSONIAN TABLES\r\n\r\n+----------+----------+--------+---------+----------+---------------+\r\n|          |          |        |         |          |   Relative    |\r\n|          |          |        | Weight  |          |   Density,    |\r\n|          |          |        |   of    |  Volume  |  Hydrogen = 1 |\r\n|          |          |Specific|One Cubic|    of    +-------+-------+\r\n|  Gas     | Chemical |Gravity |  Foot   |One Pound |       |Approx-|\r\n|          |  Symbol  | Air=1  | Pounds  |Cubic Feet| Exact | imate |\r\n+----------+----------+--------+---------+----------+-------+-------+\r\n|Oxygen    |    O     | 1.053  | .08922  |  11.208  | 15.87 |  16   |\r\n|Nitrogen  |    N     | 0.9673 | .07829  |  12.773  | 13.92 |  14   |\r\n|Hydrogen  |    H     | 0.0696 | .005621 | 177.90   |  1.00 |   1   |\r\n|Carbon    |          |        |         |          |       |       |\r\n| Dioxide  |  CO_{2}  | 1.5291 | .12269  |  8.151   | 21.83 |  22   |\r\n|Carbon    |          |        |         |          |       |       |\r\n| Monoxide |   CO     | 0.9672 | .07807  | 12.809   | 13.89 |  14   |\r\n|Methane   |  CH_{4}  | 0.5576 | .04470  | 22.371   |  7.95 |   8   |\r\n|Ethane    |C_{2}H_{6}| 1.075  | .08379  | 11.935   | 14.91 |  15   |\r\n|Acetylene |C_{2}H_{2}| 0.920  | .07254  | 13.785   | 12.91 |  13   |\r\n|Sulphur   |          |        |         |          |       |       |\r\n| Dioxide  |  SO_{2}  | 2.2639 | .17862  |  5.598   | 31.96 |  32   |\r\n|Air       |   ...    | 1.0000 | .08071  | 12.390   |  ...  |  ...  |\r\n+----------+----------+--------+---------+----------+-------+-------+\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 1942 Horse-power Installation of Babcock & Wilcox Boilers\r\nand Superheaters in the Singer Building, New York City]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCLASSIFICATION OF FUELS\r\n\r\n(WITH PARTICULAR REFERENCE TO COAL)\r\n\r\n\r\nFuels for steam boilers may be classified as solid, liquid or gaseous.\r\nOf the solid fuels, anthracite and bituminous coals are the most common,\r\nbut in this class must also be included lignite, peat, wood, bagasse and\r\nthe refuse from certain industrial processes such as sawdust, shavings,\r\ntan bark and the like. Straw, corn and coffee husks are utilized in\r\nisolated cases.\r\n\r\nThe class of liquid fuels is represented chiefly by petroleum, though\r\ncoal tar and water-gas tar are used to a limited extent.\r\n\r\nGaseous fuels are limited to natural gas, blast furnace gas and coke\r\noven gas, the first being a natural product and the two latter\r\nby-products from industrial processes. Though waste gases from certain\r\nprocesses may be considered as gaseous fuels, inasmuch as the question\r\nof combustion does not enter, the methods of utilizing them differ from\r\nthat for combustible gaseous fuel, and the question will be dealt with\r\nseparately.\r\n\r\nSince coal is by far the most generally used of all fuels, this chapter\r\nwill be devoted entirely to the formation, composition and distribution\r\nof the various grades, from anthracite to peat. The other fuels will be\r\ndiscussed in succeeding chapters and their combustion dealt with in\r\nconnection with their composition.\r\n\r\nFormation of Coal--All coals are of vegetable origin and are the remains\r\nof prehistoric forests. Destructive distillation due to great pressures\r\nand temperatures, has resolved the organic matter into its invariable\r\nultimate constituents, carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and other substances, in\r\nvarying proportions. The factors of time, depth of beds, disturbance of\r\nbeds and the intrusion of mineral matter resulting from such\r\ndisturbances have produced the variation in the degree of evolution from\r\nvegetable fiber to hard coal. This variation is shown chiefly in the\r\ncontent of carbon, and Table 35 shows the steps of such variation.\r\n\r\n                    TABLE 35\r\n\r\n     APPROXIMATE CHEMICAL CHANGES FROM WOOD\r\n            FIBER TO ANTHRACITE COAL\r\n\r\n+----------------------+-------+--------+-------+\r\n|Substance             |Carbon |Hydrogen|Oxygen |\r\n+----------------------+-------+--------+-------+\r\n|Wood Fiber            | 52.65 |  5.25  | 42.10 |\r\n|Peat                  | 59.57 |  5.96  | 34.47 |\r\n|Lignite               | 66.04 |  5.27  | 28.69 |\r\n|Earthy Brown Coal     | 73.18 |  5.68  | 21.14 |\r\n|Bituminous Coal       | 75.06 |  5.84  | 19.10 |\r\n|Semi-bituminous Coal  | 89.29 |  5.05  |  5.66 |\r\n|Anthracite Coal       | 91.58 |  3.96  |  4.46 |\r\n+----------------------+-------+--------+-------+\r\n\r\nComposition of Coal--The uncombined carbon in coal is known as fixed\r\ncarbon. Some of the carbon constituent is combined with hydrogen and\r\nthis, together with other gaseous substances driven off by the\r\napplication of heat, form that portion of the coal known as volatile\r\nmatter. The fixed carbon and the volatile matter constitute the\r\ncombustible. The oxygen and nitrogen contained in the volatile matter\r\nare not combustible, but custom has applied this term to that portion of\r\nthe coal which is dry and free from ash, thus including the oxygen and\r\nnitrogen.\r\n\r\nThe other important substances entering into the composition of coal are\r\nmoisture and the refractory earths which form the ash. The ash varies in\r\ndifferent coals from 3 to 30 per cent and the moisture from 0.75 to 45\r\nper cent of the total weight of the coal, depending upon the grade and\r\nthe locality in which it is mined. A large percentage of ash is\r\nundesirable as it not only reduces the calorific value of the fuel, but\r\nchokes up the air passages in the furnace and through the fuel bed, thus\r\npreventing the rapid combustion necessary to high efficiency. If the\r\ncoal contains an excessive quantity of sulphur, trouble will result from\r\nits harmful action on the metal of the boiler where moisture is present,\r\nand because it unites with the ash to form a fusible slag or clinker\r\nwhich will choke up the grate bars and form a solid mass in which large\r\nquantities of unconsumed carbon may be imbedded.\r\n\r\nMoisture in coal may be more detrimental than ash in reducing the\r\ntemperature of a furnace, as it is non-combustible, absorbs heat both in\r\nbeing evaporated and superheated to the temperature of the furnace\r\ngases. In some instances, however, a certain amount of moisture in a\r\nbituminous coal produces a mechanical action that assists in the\r\ncombustion and makes it possible to develop higher capacities than with\r\ndry coal.\r\n\r\nClassification of Coal--Custom has classified coals in accordance with\r\nthe varying content of carbon and volatile matter in the combustible.\r\nTable 36 gives the approximate percentages of these constituents for the\r\ngeneral classes of coals with the corresponding heat values per pound of\r\ncombustible.\r\n\r\n                            TABLE 36\r\n\r\n           APPROXIMATE COMPOSITION AND CALORIFIC VALUE\r\n        OF GENERAL GRADES OF COAL ON BASIS OF COMBUSTIBLE\r\n\r\n+-------------------+----------------------------+--------------+\r\n|   Kind of Coal    |  Per Cent of Combustible   |   B. t. u.   |\r\n|                   +------------+---------------+ Per Pound of |\r\n|                   |Fixed Carbon|Volatile Matter| Combustible  |\r\n+-------------------+------------+---------------+--------------+\r\n|Anthracite         |97.0 to 92.5|  3.0 to  7.5  |14600 to 14800|\r\n|Semi-anthracite    |92.5 to 87.5|  7.5 to 12.5  |14700 to 15500|\r\n|Semi-bituminous    |87.5 to 75.0| 12.5 to 25.0  |15500 to 16000|\r\n|Bituminous--Eastern|75.0 to 60.0| 25.0 to 40.0  |14800 to 15300|\r\n|Bituminous--Western|65.0 to 50.0| 35.0 to 50.0  |13500 to 14800|\r\n|Lignite            |  Under 50  |    Over 50    |11000 to 13500|\r\n+-------------------+------------+---------------+--------------+\r\n\r\n\r\nAnthracite--The name anthracite, or hard coal, is applied to those dry\r\ncoals containing from 3 to 7 per cent volatile matter and which do not\r\nswell when burned. True anthracite is hard, compact, lustrous and\r\nsometimes iridescent, and is characterized by few joints and clefts. Its\r\nspecific gravity varies from 1.4 to 1.8. In burning, it kindles slowly\r\nand with difficulty, is hard to keep alight, and burns with a short,\r\nalmost colorless flame, without smoke.\r\n\r\n\r\nSemi-anthracite coal has less density, hardness and luster than true\r\nanthracite, and can be distinguished from it by the fact that when newly\r\nfractured it will soot the hands. Its specific gravity is ordinarily\r\nabout 1.4. It kindles quite readily and burns more freely than the true\r\nanthracites.\r\n\r\n\r\nSemi-bituminous coal is softer than anthracite, contains more volatile\r\nhydrocarbons, kindles more easily and burns more rapidly. It is\r\nordinarily free burning, has a high calorific value and is of the\r\nhighest order for steam generating purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\nBituminous coals are still softer than those described and contain still\r\nmore volatile hydrocarbons. The difference between the semi-bituminous\r\nand the bituminous coals is an important one, economically. The former\r\nhave an average heating value per pound of combustible about 6 per cent\r\nhigher than the latter, and they burn with much less smoke in ordinary\r\nfurnaces. The distinctive characteristic of the bituminous coals is the\r\nemission of yellow flame and smoke when burning. In color they range\r\nfrom pitch black to dark brown, having a resinous luster in the most\r\ncompact specimens, and a silky luster in such specimens as show traces\r\nof vegetable fiber. The specific gravity is ordinarily about 1.3.\r\n\r\nBituminous coals are either of the caking or non-caking class. The\r\nformer, when heated, fuse and swell in size; the latter burn freely, do\r\nnot fuse, and are commonly known as free burning coals. Caking coals are\r\nrich in volatile hydrocarbons and are valuable in gas manufacture.\r\n\r\nBituminous coals absorb moisture from the atmosphere. The surface\r\nmoisture can be removed by ordinary drying, but a portion of the water\r\ncan be removed only by heating the coal to a temperature of about 250\r\ndegrees Fahrenheit.\r\n\r\nCannel coal is a variety of bituminous coal, rich in hydrogen and\r\nhydrocarbons, and is exceedingly valuable as a gas coal. It has a dull\r\nresinous luster and burns with a bright flame without fusing. Cannel\r\ncoal is seldom used for steam coal, though it is sometimes mixed with\r\nsemi-bituminous coal where an increased economy at high rates of\r\ncombustion is desired. The composition of cannel coal is approximately\r\nas follows: fixed carbon, 26 to 55 per cent; volatile matter, 42 to 64\r\nper cent; earthy matter, 2 to 14 per cent. Its specific gravity is\r\napproximately 1.24.\r\n\r\nLignite is organic matter in the earlier stages of its conversion into\r\ncoal, and includes all varieties which are intermediate between peat and\r\ncoal of the older formation. Its specific gravity is low, being 1.2 to\r\n1.23, and when freshly mined it may contain as high as 50 per cent of\r\nmoisture. Its appearance varies from a light brown, showing a distinctly\r\nwoody structure, in the poorer varieties, to a black, with a pitchy\r\nluster resembling hard coal, in the best varieties. It is non-caking and\r\nburns with a bright but slightly smoky flame with moderate heat. It is\r\neasily broken, will not stand much handling in transportation, and if\r\nexposed to the weather will rapidly disintegrate, which will increase\r\nthe difficulty of burning it.\r\n\r\nIts composition varies over wide limits. The ash may run as low as one\r\nper cent and as high as 50 per cent. Its high content of moisture and\r\nthe large quantity of air necessary for its combustion cause large stack\r\nlosses. It is distinctly a low-grade fuel and is used almost entirely in\r\nthe districts where mined, due to its cheapness.\r\n\r\nPeat is organic matter in the first stages of its conversion into coal\r\nand is found in bogs and similar places. Its moisture content when cut\r\nis extremely high, averaging 75 or 80 per cent. It is unsuitable for\r\nfuel until dried and even then will contain as much as 30 per cent\r\nmoisture. Its ash content when dry varies from 3 to 12 per cent. In this\r\ncountry, though large deposits of peat have been found, it has not as\r\nyet been found practicable to utilize it for steam generating purposes\r\nin competition with coal. In some European countries, however, the peat\r\nindustry is common.\r\n\r\nDistribution--The anthracite coals are, with some unimportant\r\nexceptions, confined to five small fields in Eastern Pennsylvania, as\r\nshown in the following list. These fields are given in the order of\r\ntheir hardness.\r\n\r\nLehigh or Eastern Middle Field\r\n  Green Mountain District\r\n  Black Creek District\r\n  Hazelton District\r\n  Beaver Meadow District\r\n  Panther Creek District[33]\r\n\r\nMahanoy or Western Field[34]\r\n  East Mahanoy District\r\n  West Mahanoy District\r\n\r\nWyoming or Northern Field\r\n  Carbondale District\r\n  Scranton District\r\n  Pittston District\r\n  Wilkesbarre District\r\n  Plymouth District\r\n\r\nSchuylkill or Southern Field\r\n  East Schuylkill District\r\n  West Schuylkill District\r\n  Louberry District\r\n\r\nLykens Valley or Southwestern Field\r\n  Lykens Valley District\r\n  Shamokin District[35]\r\n\r\nAnthracite is also found in Pulaski and Wythe Counties, Virginia; along\r\nthe border of Little Walker Mountain, and in Gunnison County, Colorado.\r\nThe areas in Virginia are limited, however, while in Colorado the\r\nquality varies greatly in neighboring beds and even in the same bed. An\r\nanthracite bed in New Mexico was described in 1870 by Dr. R. W. Raymond,\r\nformerly United States Mining Commissioner.\r\n\r\nSemi-anthracite coals are found in a few small areas in the western part\r\nof the anthracite field. The largest of these beds is the Bernice in\r\nSullivan County, Pennsylvania. Mr. William Kent, in his \"Steam Boiler\r\nEconomy\", describes this as follows: \"The Bernice semi-anthracite coal\r\nbasin lies between Beech Creek on the north and Loyalsock Creek on the\r\nsouth. It is six miles long, east and west, and hardly a third of a mile\r\nacross. An 8-foot vein of coal lies in a bed of 12 feet of coal and\r\nslate. The coal of this bed is the dividing line between anthracite and\r\nsemi-anthracite, and is similar to the coal of the Lykens Valley\r\nDistrict. Mine analyses give a range as follows: moisture, 0.65 to 1.97;\r\nvolatile matter, 3.56 to 9.40; fixed carbon, 82.52 to 89.39; ash, 3.27\r\nto 9.34; sulphur, 0.24 to 1.04.\"\r\n\r\nSemi-bituminous coals are found on the eastern edge of the great\r\nAppalachian Field. Starting with Tioga and Bradford Counties of northern\r\nPennsylvania, the bed runs southwest through Lycoming, Clearfield,\r\nCentre, Huntingdon, Cambria, Somerset and Fulton Counties, Pennsylvania;\r\nAllegheny County, Maryland; Buchannan, Dickinson, Lee, Russell, Scott,\r\nTazewell and Wise Counties, Virginia; Mercer, McDowell, Fayette, Raleigh\r\nand Mineral Counties, West Virginia; and ending in northeastern\r\nTennessee, where a small amount of semi-bituminous is mined.\r\n\r\nThe largest of the bituminous fields is the Appalachian. Beginning near\r\nthe northern boundary of Pennsylvania, in the western portion of the\r\nState, it extends southwestward through West Virginia, touching Maryland\r\nand Virginia on their western borders, passing through southeastern\r\nOhio, eastern Kentucky and central Tennessee, and ending in western\r\nAlabama, 900 miles from its northern extremity.\r\n\r\nThe next bituminous coal producing region to the west is the Northern\r\nField, in north central Michigan. Still further to the west, and second\r\nin importance to the Appalachian Field, is the Eastern Interior Field.\r\nThis covers, with the exception of the upper northern portion, nearly\r\nthe entire State of Illinois, southwest Indiana and the western portion\r\nof Kentucky.\r\n\r\nThe Western Field extends through central and southern Iowa, western\r\nMissouri, southwestern Kansas, eastern Oklahoma and the west central\r\nportion of Arkansas. The Southwestern Field is confined entirely to the\r\nnorth central portion of Texas, in which State there are also two small\r\nisolated fields along the Rio Grande River.\r\n\r\nThe remaining bituminous fields are scattered through what may be termed\r\nthe Rocky Mountain Region, extending from Montana to New Orleans. A\r\npartial list of these fields and their location follows:\r\n\r\nJudith Basin               Central Montana\r\nBull Mountain Field        Central Montana\r\nYellowstone Region         Southwestern Montana\r\nBig Horn Basin Region      Southern Montana\r\nBig Horn Basin Region      Northern Wyoming\r\nBlack Hills Region         Northeastern Wyoming\r\nHanna Field                Southern Wyoming\r\nGreen River Region         Southwestern Wyoming\r\nYampa Field                Northwestern Colorado\r\nNorth Park Field           Northern Colorado\r\nDenver Region              North Central Colorado\r\nUinta Region               Western Colorado\r\nUinta Region               Eastern Utah\r\nSouthwestern Region        Southwestern Utah\r\nRaton Mountain Region      Southern Colorado\r\nRaton Mountain Region      Northern New Mexico\r\nSan Juan River Region      Northwestern New Mexico\r\nCapitan Field              Southern New Mexico\r\n\r\nAlong the Pacific Coast a few small fields are scattered in western\r\nCalifornia, southwestern Oregon, western and northwestern Washington.\r\n\r\nMost of the coals in the above fields are on the border line between\r\nbituminous and lignite. They are really a low grade of bituminous coal\r\nand are known as sub-bituminous or black lignites.\r\n\r\nLignites--These resemble the brown coals of Europe and are found in the\r\nwestern states, Wyoming, New Mexico, Arizona, Utah, Montana, North\r\nDakota, Nevada, California, Oregon and Washington. Many of the fields\r\ngiven as those containing bituminous coals in the western states also\r\ncontain true lignite. Lignite is also found in the eastern part of Texas\r\nand in Oklahoma.\r\n\r\nAlaska Coals--Coal has been found in Alaska and undoubtedly is of great\r\nvalue, though the extent and character of the fields have probably been\r\nexaggerated. Great quantities of lignite are known to exist, and in\r\nquality the coal ranges in character from lignite to anthracite. There\r\nare at present, however, only two fields of high-grade coals known,\r\nthese being the Bering River Field, near Controllers Bay, and the\r\nMatanuska Field, at the head of Cooks Inlet. Both of these fields are\r\nknown to contain both anthracite and high-grade bituminous coals, though\r\nas yet they cannot be said to have been opened up.\r\n\r\nWeathering of Coal--The storage of coal has become within the last few\r\nyears to a certain extent a necessity due to market conditions, danger\r\nof labor difficulties at the mines and in the railroads, and the\r\ncrowding of transportation facilities. The first cause is probably the\r\nmost important, and this is particularly true of anthracite coals where\r\na sliding scale of prices is used according to the season of the year.\r\nWhile market conditions serve as one of the principal reasons for coal\r\nstorage, most power plants and manufacturing plants feel compelled to\r\nprotect their coal supply from the danger of strikes, car shortages and\r\nthe like, and it is customary for large power plants, railroads and coal\r\ncompanies themselves, to store bituminous coal. Naval coaling stations\r\nare also an example of what is done along these lines.\r\n\r\nAnthracite is the nearest approach to the ideal coal for storing. It is\r\nnot subject to spontaneous ignition, and for this reason is unlimited in\r\nthe amount that may be stored in one pile. With bituminous coals,\r\nhowever, the case is different. Most bituminous coals will ignite if\r\nplaced in large enough piles and all suffer more or less from\r\ndisintegration. Coal producers only store such coals as are least liable\r\nto ignite, and which will stand rehandling for shipment.\r\n\r\nThe changes which take place in stored coal are of two kinds: 1st, the\r\noxidization of the inorganic matter such as pyrites; and 2nd, the direct\r\noxidization of the organic matter of the actual coal.\r\n\r\nThe first change will result in an increased volume of the coal, and\r\nsometimes in an increased weight, and a marked disintegration. The\r\nchanges due to direct oxidization of the coal substances usually cannot\r\nbe detected by the eye, but as they involve the oxidization of the\r\ncarbon and available hydrogen and the absorption of the oxygen by\r\nunsaturated hydrocarbons, they are the chief cause of the weathering\r\nlosses in heat value. Numerous experiments have led to the conclusion\r\nthat this is also the cause for spontaneous combustion.\r\n\r\nExperiments to show loss in calorific heat values due to weathering\r\nindicate that such loss may be as high as 10 per cent when the coal is\r\nstored in the air, and 8.75 per cent when stored under water. It would\r\nappear that the higher the volatile content of the coal, the greater\r\nwill be the loss in calorific value and the more subject to spontaneous\r\nignition.\r\n\r\nSome experiments made by Messrs. S. W. Parr and W. F. Wheeler, published\r\nin 1909 by the Experiment Station of the University of Illinois,\r\nindicate that coals of the nature found in Illinois and neighboring\r\nstates are not affected seriously during storage from the standpoint of\r\nweight and heating value, the latter loss averaging about 3½ per cent\r\nfor the first year of storage. They found that the losses due to\r\ndisintegration and to spontaneous ignition were of greater importance.\r\nTheir conclusions agree with those deduced from the other experiments,\r\nviz., that the storing of a larger size coal than that which is to be\r\nused, will overcome to a certain extent the objection to disintegration,\r\nand that the larger sizes, besides being advantageous in respect to\r\ndisintegration, are less liable to spontaneous ignition. Storage under\r\nwater will, of course, entirely prevent any fire loss and, to a great\r\nextent, will stop disintegration and reduce the calorific losses to a\r\nminimum.\r\n\r\nTo minimize the danger of spontaneous ignition in storing coal, the\r\npiles should be thoroughly ventilated.\r\n\r\nPulverized Fuels--Considerable experimental work has been done with\r\npulverized coal, utilizing either coal dust or pulverizing such coal as\r\nis too small to be burned in other ways. If satisfactorily fed to the\r\nfurnace, it would appear to have several advantages. The dust burned in\r\nsuspension would be more completely consumed than is the case with the\r\nsolid coals, the production of smoke would be minimized, and the process\r\nwould admit of an adjustment of the air supply to a point very close to\r\nthe amount theoretically required. This is due to the fact that in\r\nburning there is an intimate mixture of the air and fuel. The principal\r\nobjections have been in the inability to introduce the pulverized fuel\r\ninto the furnace uniformly, the difficulty of reducing the fuel to the\r\nsame degree of fineness, liability of explosion in the furnace due to\r\nimproper mixture with the air, and the decreased capacity and efficiency\r\nresulting from the difficulty of keeping tube surfaces clean.\r\n\r\nPressed Fuels--In this class are those composed of the dust of some\r\nsuitable combustible, pressed and cemented together by a substance\r\npossessing binding and in most cases inflammable properties. Such fuels,\r\nknown as briquettes, are extensively used in foreign countries and\r\nconsist of carbon or soft coal, too small to be burned in the ordinary\r\nway, mixed usually with pitch or coal tar. Much experimenting has been\r\ndone in this country in briquetting fuels, the government having taken\r\nan active interest in the question, but as yet this class of fuel has\r\nnot come into common use as the cost and difficulty of manufacture and\r\nhandling have made it impossible to place it in the market at a price to\r\nsuccessfully compete with coal.\r\n\r\nCoke is a porous product consisting almost entirely of carbon remaining\r\nafter certain manufacturing processes have distilled off the hydrocarbon\r\ngases of the fuel used. It is produced, first, from gas coal distilled\r\nin gas retorts; second, from gas or ordinary bituminous coals burned in\r\nspecial furnaces called coke ovens; and third, from petroleum by\r\ncarrying the distillation of the residuum to a red heat.\r\n\r\nCoke is a smokeless fuel. It readily absorbs moisture from the\r\natmosphere and if not kept under cover its moisture content may be as\r\nmuch as 20 per cent of its own weight.\r\n\r\nGas-house coke is generally softer and more porous than oven coke,\r\nignites more readily, and requires less draft for its combustion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 16,000 Horse-power Installation of Babcock & Wilcox\r\nBoilers and Superheaters at the Brunot's Island Plant of the Duquesne\r\nLight Co., Pittsburgh, Pa.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DETERMINATION OF HEATING VALUES OF FUELS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe heating value of a fuel may be determined either by a calculation\r\nfrom a chemical analysis or by burning a sample in a calorimeter.\r\n\r\nIn the former method the calculation should be based on an ultimate\r\nanalysis, which reduces the fuel to its elementary constituents of\r\ncarbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, sulphur, ash and moisture, to secure\r\na reasonable degree of accuracy. A proximate analysis, which determines\r\nonly the percentage of moisture, fixed carbon, volatile matter and ash,\r\nwithout determining the ultimate composition of the volatile matter,\r\ncannot be used for computing the heat of combustion with the same degree\r\nof accuracy as an ultimate analysis, but estimates may be based on the\r\nultimate analysis that are fairly correct.\r\n\r\nAn ultimate analysis requires the services of a competent chemist, and\r\nthe methods to be employed in such a determination will be found in any\r\nstandard book on engineering chemistry. An ultimate analysis, while\r\nresolving the fuel into its elementary constituents, does not reveal how\r\nthese may have been combined in the fuel. The manner of their\r\ncombination undoubtedly has a direct effect upon their calorific value,\r\nas fuels having almost identical ultimate analyses show a difference in\r\nheating value when tested in a calorimeter. Such a difference, however,\r\nis slight, and very close approximations may be computed from the\r\nultimate analysis.\r\n\r\nUltimate analyses are given on both a moist and a dry fuel basis.\r\nInasmuch as the latter is the basis generally accepted for the\r\ncomparison of data, it would appear that it is the best basis on which\r\nto report such an analysis. When an analysis is given on a moist fuel\r\nbasis it may be readily converted to a dry basis by dividing the\r\npercentages of the various constituents by one minus the percentage of\r\nmoisture, reporting the moisture content separately.\r\n\r\n        _Moist Fuel_   _Dry Fuel_\r\n\r\nC          83.95         84.45\r\nH           4.23          4.25\r\nO           3.02          3.04\r\nN           1.27          1.28\r\nS            .91           .91\r\nAsh         6.03          6.07\r\n                        ------\r\n                        100.00\r\n\r\nMoisture     .59           .59\r\n          ------\r\n          100.00\r\n\r\nCalculations from an Ultimate Analysis--The first formula for the\r\ncalculation of heating values from the composition of a fuel as\r\ndetermined from an ultimate analysis is due to Dulong, and this formula,\r\nslightly modified, is the most commonly used to-day. Other formulae have\r\nbeen proposed, some of which are more accurate for certain specific\r\nclasses of fuel, but all have their basis in Dulong's formula, the\r\naccepted modified form of which is:\r\n\r\nHeat units in B. t. u. per pound of dry fuel =\r\n\r\n                      O\r\n14,600 C + 62,000(H - -) + 4000 S      (18)\r\n                      8\r\n\r\nwhere C, H, O and S are the proportionate parts by weight of carbon,\r\nhydrogen, oxygen and sulphur.\r\n\r\nAssume a coal of the composition given. Substituting in this formula\r\n(18),\r\n\r\nHeating value per pound of dry coal\r\n\r\n                          (        .0304)\r\n= 14,600 × .8445 + 62,000 (.0425 - -----) + 4000 × .0091 = 14,765 B. t. u.\r\n                          (          8  )\r\n\r\nThis coal, by a calorimetric test, showed 14,843 B. t. u., and from a\r\ncomparison the degree of accuracy of the formula will be noted.\r\n\r\nThe investigation of Lord and Haas in this country, Mabler in France,\r\nand Bunte in Germany, all show that Dulong's formula gives results\r\nnearly identical with those obtained from calorimetric tests and may be\r\nsafely applied to all solid fuels except cannel coal, lignite, turf and\r\nwood, provided the ultimate analysis is correct. This practically limits\r\nits use to coal. The limiting features are the presence of hydrogen and\r\ncarbon united in the form of hydrocarbons. Such hydrocarbons are present\r\nin coals in small quantities, but they have positive and negative heats\r\nof combination, and in coals these appear to offset each other,\r\ncertainly sufficiently to apply the formula to such fuels.\r\n\r\nHigh and Low Heat Value of Fuels--In any fuel containing hydrogen the\r\ncalorific value as found by the calorimeter is higher than that\r\nobtainable under most working conditions in boiler practice by an amount\r\nequal to the latent heat of the volatilization of water. This heat would\r\nreappear when the vapor was condensed, though in ordinary practice the\r\nvapor passes away uncondensed. This fact gives rise to a distinction in\r\nheat values into the so-called \"higher\" and \"lower\" calorific values.\r\nThe higher value, _i. e._, the one determined by the calorimeter, is the\r\nonly scientific unit, is the value which should be used in boiler\r\ntesting work, and is the one recommended by the American Society of\r\nMechanical Engineers.\r\n\r\nThere is no absolute measure of the lower heat of combustion, and in\r\nview of the wide difference in opinion among physicists as to the\r\ndeductions to be made from the higher or absolute unit in this\r\ndetermination, the lower value must be considered an artificial unit.\r\nThe lower value entails the use of an ultimate analysis and involves\r\nassumptions that would make the employment of such a unit impracticable\r\nfor commercial work. The use of the low value may also lead to error and\r\nis in no way to be recommended for boiler practice.\r\n\r\nAn example of its illogical use may be shown by the consideration of a\r\nboiler operated in connection with a special economizer where the vapor\r\nproduced by hydrogen is partially condensed by the economizer. If the\r\nlow value were used in computing the boiler efficiency, it is obvious\r\nthat the total efficiency of the combined boiler and economizer must be\r\nin error through crediting the combination with the heat imparted in\r\ncondensing the vapor and not charging such heat to the heat value of the\r\ncoal.\r\n\r\nHeating Value of Gaseous Fuels--The method of computing calorific values\r\nfrom an ultimate analysis is particularly adapted to solid fuels, with\r\nthe exceptions already noted. The heating value of gaseous fuels may be\r\ncalculated by Dulong's formula provided another term is added to provide\r\nfor any carbon monoxide present. Such a method, however, involves the\r\nseparating of the constituent gases into their elementary gases, which\r\nis oftentimes difficult and liable to simple arithmetical error. As the\r\ncombustible portion of gaseous fuels is ordinarily composed of hydrogen,\r\ncarbon monoxide and certain hydrocarbons, a determination of the\r\ncalorific value is much more readily obtained by a separation into their\r\nconstituent gases and a computation of the calorific value from a table\r\nof such values of the constituents. Table 37 gives the calorific value\r\nof the more common combustible gases, together with the theoretical\r\namount of air required for their combustion.\r\n\r\n                               TABLE 37\r\n\r\n              WEIGHT AND CALORIFIC VALUE OF VARIOUS GASES\r\n           AT 32 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT AND ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE\r\n        WITH THEORETICAL AMOUNT OF AIR REQUIRED FOR COMBUSTION\r\n\r\n+---------------+----------+------+-----+------+----------+-----------+\r\n|      Gas      |  Symbol  |Cubic |B.t.u|B.t.u.|Cubic Feet|Cubic Feet |\r\n|               |          | Feet | per | per  |  of Air  |  of Air   |\r\n|               |          |of Gas|Pound|Cubic | Required | Required  |\r\n|               |          | per  |     | Foot |per Pound | Per Cubic |\r\n|               |          |Pound |     |      |  of Gas  |Foot of Gas|\r\n+---------------+----------+------+-----+------+----------+-----------+\r\n|Hydrogen       |    H     |177.90|62000|  349 |  428.25  |    2.41   |\r\n|Carbon Monoxide|    CO    | 12.81| 4450|  347 |   30.60  |    2.39   |\r\n|Methane        |CH_{4}    | 22.37|23550| 1053 |  214.00  |    9.57   |\r\n|Acetylene      |C_{2}H_{2}| 13.79|21465| 1556 |  164.87  |   11.93   |\r\n|Olefiant Gas   |C_{2}H_{4}| 12.80|21440| 1675 |  183.60  |   14.33   |\r\n|Ethane         |C_{2}H_{6}| 11.94|22230| 1862 |  199.88  |   16.74   |\r\n+---------------+----------+------+-----+------+----------+-----------+\r\n\r\nIn applying this table, as gas analyses may be reported either by weight\r\nor volume, there is given in Table 33[36] a method of changing from\r\nvolumetric analysis to analysis by weight.\r\n\r\n\r\nExamples:\r\n\r\n\r\n1st.

A method of making such an analysis which has been\r\nfound to give eminently satisfactory results is described below.\r\n\r\nFrom the coal sample obtained on the boiler trial, an average sample of\r\napproximately 40 grams is broken up and weighed. A good means of\r\nreducing such a sample is passing it through an ordinary coffee mill.\r\nThis sample should be placed in a double-walled air bath, which should\r\nbe kept at an approximately constant temperature of 105 degrees\r\ncentigrade, the sample being weighed at intervals until a minimum is\r\nreached. The percentage of moisture can be calculated from the loss in\r\nsuch a drying.\r\n\r\nFor the determination of the remainder of the analysis, and the heating\r\nvalue of the fuel, a portion of this dried sample should be thoroughly\r\npulverized, and if it is to be kept, should be placed in an air-tight\r\nreceptacle. One gram of the pulverized sample should be weighed into a\r\nporcelain crucible equipped with a well fitting lid. This crucible\r\nshould be supported on a platinum triangle and heated for seven minutes\r\nover the full flame of a Bunsen burner. At the end of such time the\r\nsample should be placed in a desiccator containing calcium chloride, and\r\nwhen cooled should be weighed. From the loss the percentage of volatile\r\ncombustible matter may be readily calculated.\r\n\r\nThe same sample from which the volatile matter has been driven should be\r\nused in the determination of the percentage of ash. This percentage is\r\nobtained by burning the fixed carbon over a Bunsen burner or in a muffle\r\nfurnace. The burning should be kept up until a constant weight is\r\nsecured, and it may be assisted by stirring with a platinum rod. The\r\nweight of the residue determines the percentage of ash, and the\r\npercentage of fixed carbon is easily calculated from the loss during the\r\ndetermination of ash after the volatile matter has been driven off.\r\n\r\nProximate analyses may be made and reported on a moist or dry basis. The\r\ndry basis is that ordinarily accepted, and this is the basis adopted\r\nthroughout this book. The method of converting from a moist to a dry\r\nbasis is the same as described in the case of an ultimate analysis. A\r\nproximate analysis is easily made, gives information as to the general\r\ncharacteristics of a fuel and of its _relative_ heating value.\r\n\r\nTable 38 gives the proximate analysis and calorific value of a number of\r\nrepresentative coals found in the United States.\r\n\r\n                                  TABLE 38\r\n\r\nAPPROXIMATE COMPOSITION AND CALORIFIC VALUE OF CERTAIN TYPICAL AMERICAN COALS\r\n\r\n____________________________________________________________________________\r\n    |       |                |                |               |             |\r\n    |       |                |                |               |             |\r\nNo. | State |     County     |   Field, Bed   |     Mine      |    Size     |\r\n    |       |                |    or Vein     |               |             |\r\n    |       |                |                |               |             |\r\n    |       |                |                |               |             |\r\n____|_______|________________|________________|_______________|_____________|\r\n    |       |                                                 |             |\r\n    |       |                   ANTHRACITES                   |             |\r\n____|_______|_________________________________________________|_____________|\r\n    |       |                |                |               |             |\r\n  1 | Pa.   | Carbon         | Lehigh         | Beaver Meadow |             |\r\n  2 | Pa.   | Dauphin        | Schuylkill     |               | Buckwheat   |\r\n  3 | Pa.   | Lackawanna     | Wyoming        | Belleview     | No. 2 Buck. |\r\n  4 | Pa.   | Lackawanna     | Wyoming        | Johnson       | Culm.       |\r\n  5 | Pa.   | Luzerne        | Wyoming        | Pittston      | No. 2 Buck. |\r\n  6 | Pa.   | Luzerne        | Wyoming        | Mammoth       | Large       |\r\n  7 | Pa.   | Luzerne        | Wyoming        | Exeter        | Rice        |\r\n  8 | Pa.   | Northumberland | Schuylkill     | Treverton     |             |\r\n  9 | Pa.   | Schuylkill     | Schuylkill     | Buck Mountain |             |\r\n 10 | Pa.   | Schuylkill     |                | York Farm     | Buckwheat   |\r\n 11 | Pa.   |                |                | Victoria      | Buckwheat   |\r\n 12 | Pa.   | Carbon         | Lehigh         | Lehigh &      | Buck. & Pea |\r\n    |       |                |                | Wilkes C.

William Kent[38] deducted from\r\nMahler's tests of European coals the approximate heating value dependent\r\nupon the content of fixed carbon in the combustible. The relation as\r\ndeduced by Kent between the heat and value per pound of combustible and\r\nthe per cent of fixed carbon referred to combustible is represented\r\ngraphically by Fig. 23.\r\n\r\nGoutal gives another method of determining the heat value from a\r\nproximate analysis, in which the carbon is given a fixed value and the\r\nheating value of the volatile matter is considered as a function of its\r\npercentage referred to combustible. Goutal's method checks closely with\r\nKent's determinations.\r\n\r\nAll the formulae, however, for computing the calorific value of coals\r\nfrom a proximate analysis are ordinarily limited to certain classes of\r\nfuels. Mr. Kent, for instance, states that his deductions are correct\r\nwithin a close limit for fuels containing more than 60 per cent of fixed\r\ncarbon in the combustible, while for those containing a lower\r\npercentage, the error may be as great as 4 per cent, either high or low.\r\n\r\nWhile the use of such computations will serve where approximate results\r\nonly are required, that they are approximate should be thoroughly\r\nunderstood.\r\n\r\nCalorimetry--An ultimate or a proximate analysis of a fuel is useful in\r\ndetermining its general characteristics, and as described on page 183,\r\nmay be used in the calculation of the approximate heating value. Where\r\nthe efficiency of a boiler is to be computed, however, this heating\r\nvalue should in all instances be determined accurately by means of a\r\nfuel calorimeter.\r\n\r\n[Graph: B.T.U. per Pound of Combustible\r\nagainst Per Cent of Fixed Carbon in Combustible\r\n\r\nFig. 23. Graphic Representation of Relation between Heat Value Per Pound\r\nof Combustible and Fixed Carbon in Combustible as Deduced by Wm. Kent.]\r\n\r\nIn such an apparatus the fuel is completely burned and the heat\r\ngenerated by such combustion is absorbed by water, the amount of heat\r\nbeing calculated from the elevation in the temperature of the water. A\r\ncalorimeter which has been accepted as the best for such work is one in\r\nwhich the fuel is burned in a steel bomb filled with compressed oxygen.\r\nThe function of the oxygen, which is ordinarily under a pressure of\r\nabout 25 atmospheres, is to cause the rapid and complete combustion of\r\nthe fuel sample. The fuel is ignited by means of an electric current,\r\nallowance being made for the heat produced by such current, and by the\r\nburning of the fuse wire.\r\n\r\nA calorimeter of this type which will be found to give satisfactory\r\nresults is that of M. Pierre Mahler, illustrated in Fig. 24 and\r\nconsisting of the following parts:\r\n\r\nA water jacket A, which maintains constant conditions outside of the\r\ncalorimeter proper, and thus makes possible a more accurate computation\r\nof radiation losses.\r\n\r\nThe porcelain lined steel bomb B, in which the combustion of the fuel\r\ntakes place in compressed oxygen.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 24. Mahler Bomb Calorimeter]\r\n\r\nThe platinum pan C, for holding the fuel.\r\n\r\nThe calorimeter proper D, surrounding the bomb and containing a definite\r\nweighed amount of water.\r\n\r\nAn electrode E, connecting with the fuse wire F, for igniting the fuel\r\nplaced in the pan C.\r\n\r\nA support G, for a water agitator.\r\n\r\nA thermometer I, for temperature determination of the water in the\r\ncalorimeter. The thermometer is best supported by a stand independent of\r\nthe calorimeter, so that it may not be moved by tremors in the parts of\r\nthe calorimeter, which would render the making of readings difficult. To\r\nobtain accuracy of readings, they should be made through a telescope or\r\neyeglass.\r\n\r\nA spring and screw device for revolving the agitator.\r\n\r\nA lever L, by the movement of which the agitator is revolved.\r\n\r\nA pressure gauge M, for noting the amount of oxygen admitted to the\r\nbomb. Between 20 and 25 atmospheres are ordinarily employed.\r\n\r\nAn oxygen tank O.\r\n\r\nA battery or batteries P, the current from which heats the fuse wire\r\nused to ignite the fuel.\r\n\r\nThis or a similar calorimeter is used in the determination of the heat\r\nof combustion of solid or liquid fuels. Whatever the fuel to be tested,\r\ntoo much importance cannot be given to the securing of an average\r\nsample. Where coal is to be tested, tests should be made from a portion\r\nof the dried and pulverized laboratory sample, the methods of obtaining\r\nwhich have been described. In considering the methods of calorimeter\r\ndetermination, the remarks applied to coal are equally applicable to any\r\nsolid fuel, and such changes in methods as are necessary for liquid\r\nfuels will be self-evident from the same description.\r\n\r\nApproximately one gram of the pulverized dried coal sample should be\r\nplaced directly in the pan of the calorimeter. There is some danger in\r\nthe using of a pulverized sample from the fact that some of it may be\r\nblown out of the pan when oxygen is admitted. This may be at least\r\npartially overcome by forming about two grams into a briquette by the\r\nuse of a cylinder equipped with a plunger and a screw press. Such a\r\nbriquette should be broken and approximately one gram used. If a\r\npulverized sample is used, care should be taken to admit oxygen slowly\r\nto prevent blowing the coal out of the pan. The weight of the sample is\r\nlimited to approximately one gram since the calorimeter is proportioned\r\nfor the combustion of about this weight when under an oxygen pressure of\r\nabout 25 atmospheres.\r\n\r\nA piece of fine iron wire is connected to the lower end of the plunger\r\nto form a fuse for igniting the sample. The weight of iron wire used is\r\ndetermined, and if after combustion a portion has not been burned, the\r\nweight of such portion is determined. In placing the sample in the pan,\r\nand in adjusting the fuse, the top of the calorimeter is removed. It is\r\nthen replaced and carefully screwed into place on the bomb by means of a\r\nlong handled wrench furnished for the purpose.\r\n\r\nThe bomb is then placed in the calorimeter, which has been filled with a\r\ndefinite amount of water. This weight is the \"water equivalent\" of the\r\napparatus, _i. e._, the weight of water, the temperature of which would\r\nbe increased one degree for an equivalent increase in the temperature of\r\nthe combined apparatus. It may be determined by calculation from the\r\nweights and specific heats of the various parts of the apparatus. Such a\r\ndetermination is liable to error, however, as the weight of the bomb\r\nlining can only be approximated, and a considerable portion of the\r\napparatus is not submerged. Another method of making such a\r\ndetermination is by the adding of definite weights of warm water to\r\ndefinite amounts of cooler water in the calorimeter and taking an\r\naverage of a number of experiments. The best method for the making of\r\nsuch a determination is probably the burning of a definite amount of\r\nresublimed naphthaline whose heat of combustion is known.\r\n\r\nThe temperature of the water in the water jacket of the calorimeter\r\nshould be approximately that of the surrounding atmosphere. The\r\ntemperature of the weighed amount of water in the calorimeter is made by\r\nsome experimenters slightly greater than that of the surrounding air in\r\norder that the initial correction for radiation will be in the same\r\ndirection as the final correction. Other experimenters start from a\r\ntemperature the same or slightly lower than the temperature of the room,\r\non the basis that the temperature after combustion will be slightly\r\nhigher than the room temperature and the radiation correction be either\r\na minimum or entirely eliminated.\r\n\r\nWhile no experiments have been made to show conclusively which of these\r\nmethods is the better, the latter is generally used.\r\n\r\nAfter the bomb has been placed in the calorimeter, it is filled with\r\noxygen from a tank until the pressure reaches from 20 to 25 atmospheres.\r\nThe lower pressure will be sufficient in all but exceptional cases.\r\nConnection is then made to a current from the dry batteries in series so\r\narranged as to allow completion of the circuit with a switch. The\r\ncurrent from a lighting system should not be used for ignition, as there\r\nis danger from sparking in burning the fuse, which may effect the\r\nresults. The apparatus is then ready for the test.\r\n\r\nUnquestionably the best method of taking data is by the use of\r\nco-ordinate paper and a plotting of the data with temperatures and time\r\nintervals as ordinates and abscissae. Such a graphic representation is\r\nshown in Fig. 25.\r\n\r\n[Graph: Temperature--° C. against Time--Hours and Minutes\r\n\r\nFig. 25. Graphic Method of Recording Bomb Calorimeter Results]\r\n\r\nAfter the bomb is placed in the calorimeter, and before the coal is\r\nignited, readings of the temperature of the water should be taken at one\r\nminute intervals for a period long enough to insure a constant rate of\r\nchange, and in this way determine the initial radiation. The coal is\r\nthen ignited by completing the circuit, the temperature at the instant\r\nthe circuit is closed being considered the temperature at the beginning\r\nof the combustion. After ignition the readings should be taken at\r\none-half minute intervals, though because of the rapidity of the\r\nmercury's rise approximate readings only may be possible for at least a\r\nminute after the firing, such readings, however, being sufficiently\r\naccurate for this period. The one-half minute readings should be taken\r\nafter ignition for five minutes, and for, say, five minutes longer at\r\nminute intervals to determine accurately the final rate of radiation.\r\n\r\nFig. 25 shows the results of such readings, plotted in accordance with\r\nthe method suggested. It now remains to compute the results from this\r\nplotted data.\r\n\r\nThe radiation correction is first applied. Probably the most accurate\r\nmanner of making such correction is by the use of Pfaundler's method,\r\nwhich is a modification of that of Regnault. This assumes that in\r\nstarting with an initial rate of radiation, as represented by the\r\ninclination of the line AB, Fig. 25, and ending with a final radiation\r\nrepresented by the inclination of the line CD, Fig. 25, that the rate of\r\nradiation for the intermediate temperatures between the points B and C\r\nare proportional to the initial and final rates. That is, the rate of\r\nradiation at a point midway between B and C will be the mean between the\r\ninitial and final rates; the rate of radiation at a point three-quarters\r\nof the distance between B and C would be the rate at B plus\r\nthree-quarters of the difference in rates at B and C, etc. This method\r\ndiffers from Regnault's in that the radiation was assumed by Regnault to\r\nbe in each case proportional to the difference in temperatures between\r\nthe water of the calorimeter and the surrounding air plus a constant\r\nfound for each experiment. Pfaundler's method is more simple than that\r\nof Regnault, and the results by the two methods are in practical\r\nagreement.\r\n\r\nExpressed as a formula, Pfaundler's method is, though not in form given\r\nby him:\r\n\r\n      _                 _\r\n     |    R' - R         |\r\nC = N|R + ------ (T\" - T)|      (19)\r\n     |_   T' - T        _|\r\n\r\nWhere C  = correction in degree centigrade,\r\n      N  = number of intervals over which correction is made,\r\n      R  = initial radiation in degrees per interval,\r\n      R' = final radiation in degrees per interval,\r\n      T  = average temperature for period through which initial radiation\r\n           is computed,\r\n      T\" = average temperature over period of combustion[39],\r\n      T' = average temperature over period through which final radiation\r\n           is computed.[39]\r\n\r\nThe application of this formula to Fig. 25 is as follows:\r\n\r\nAs already stated, the temperature at the beginning of combustion is the\r\nreading just before the current is turned on, or B in Fig. 25. The point\r\nC or the temperature at which combustion is presumably completed, should\r\nbe taken at a point which falls well within the established final rate\r\nof radiation, and not at the maximum temperature that the thermometer\r\nindicates in the test, unless it lies on the straight line determining\r\nthe final radiation. This is due to the fact that in certain instances\r\nlocal conditions will cause the thermometer to read higher than it\r\nshould during the time that the bomb is transmitting heat to the water\r\nrapidly, and at other times the maximum temperature might be lower than\r\nthat which would be indicated were readings to be taken at intervals of\r\nless than one-half minute, _i. e._, the point of maximum temperature\r\nwill fall below the line determined by the final rate of radiation. With\r\nthis understanding AB, Fig. 25, represents the time of initial\r\nradiation, BC the time of combustion, and CD the time of final\r\nradiation. Therefore to apply Pfaundler's correction, formula (19), to\r\nthe data as represented by Fig. 25.\r\n\r\nN = 6, R = 0, R' = .01, T = 20.29, T' = 22.83,\r\n\r\n     20.29 + 22.54 + 22.84 + 22.88 + 22.87 + 22.86\r\nT\" = --------------------------------------------- = 22.36\r\n                           6\r\n\r\n      _                              _\r\n     |       .01 - 0                  |\r\nC = 6|0 + -------------(22.36 - 20.29)|\r\n     |_   22.85 - 20.29              _|\r\n\r\n  = 6 × .008 = .048\r\n\r\nPfaundler's formula while simple is rather long. Mr. E. H. Peabody has\r\ndevised a simpler formula with which, under proper conditions, the\r\nvariation from correction as found by Pfaundler's method is negligible.\r\n\r\nIt was noted throughout an extended series of calorimeter tests that the\r\nmaximum temperature was reached by the thermometer slightly over one\r\nminute after the time of firing. If this period between the time of\r\nfiring and the maximum temperature reported was exactly one minute, the\r\nradiation through this period would equal the radiation per one-half\r\nminute _before firing_ plus the radiation per one-half minute _after the\r\nmaximum temperature is reached_; or, the radiation through the one\r\nminute interval would be the average of the radiation per minute before\r\nfiring and the radiation per minute after the maximum. A plotted chart\r\nof temperatures would take the form of a curve of three straight lines\r\n(B, C', D) in Fig. 25. Under such conditions, using the notation as in\r\nformula (19) the correction would become,\r\n\r\n    2R + 2R'\r\nC = ------- + (N - 2)R', or R + (N - 1)R'      (20)\r\n       2\r\n\r\nThis formula may be generalized for conditions where the maximum\r\ntemperature is reached after a period of more than one minute as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nLet M = the number of intervals between the time of firing and the\r\nmaximum temperature. Then the radiation through this period will be an\r\naverage of the radiation for M intervals before firing and for M\r\nintervals after the maximum is recorded, or\r\n\r\n    MR + MR'              M          M\r\nC = ------- + (N - M)R' = - R + (N - -)R'      (21)\r\n       2                  2          2\r\n\r\nIn the case of Mr. Peabody's deductions M was found to be approximately\r\n2 and formula (21) becomes directly, C = R + (N - 1)R' or formula (20).\r\n\r\nThe corrections to be made, as secured by the use of this formula, are\r\nvery close to those secured by Pfaundler's method, where the point of\r\nmaximum temperature is not more than five intervals later than the point\r\nof firing. Where a longer period than this is indicated in the chart of\r\nplotted temperatures, the approximate formula should not be used. As the\r\nperiod between firing and the maximum temperature is increased, the\r\nplotted results are further and further away from the theoretical\r\nstraight line curve. Where this period is not over five intervals, or\r\ntwo and a half minutes, an approximation of the straight line curve may\r\nbe plotted by eye, and ordinarily the radiation correction to be applied\r\nmay be determined very closely from such an approximated curve.\r\n\r\nPeabody's approximate formula has been found from a number of tests to\r\ngive results within .003 degrees Fahrenheit for the limits within which\r\nits application holds good as described. The value of M, which is not\r\nnecessarily a whole number, should be determined for each test, though\r\nin all probability such a value is a constant for any individual\r\ncalorimeter which is properly operated.\r\n\r\nThe correction for radiation as found on page 188 is in all instances to\r\nbe added to the range of temperature between the firing point and the\r\npoint chosen from which the final radiation is calculated. This\r\ncorrected range multiplied by the water equivalent of the calorimeter\r\ngives the heat of combustion in calories of the coal burned in the\r\ncalorimeter together with that evolved by the burning of the fuse wire.\r\nThe heat evolved by the burning of the fuse wire is found from the\r\ndetermination of the actual weight of wire burned and the heat of\r\ncombustion of one milligram of the wire (1.7 calories), _i. e._,\r\nmultiply the weight of wire used by 1.7, the result being in gram\r\ncalories or the heat required to raise one gram of water one degree\r\ncentigrade.\r\n\r\nOther small corrections to be made are those for the formation of nitric\r\nacid and for the combustion of sulphur to sulphuric acid instead of\r\nsulphur dioxide, due to the more complete combustion in the presence of\r\noxygen than would be possible in the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nTo make these corrections the bomb of the calorimeter is carefully\r\nwashed out with water after each test and the amount of acid determined\r\nfrom titrating this water with a standard solution of ammonia or of\r\ncaustic soda, all of the acid being assumed to be nitric acid. Each\r\ncubic centimeter of the ammonia titrating solution used is equivalent to\r\na correction of 2.65 calories.\r\n\r\nAs part of acidity is due to the formation of sulphuric acid, a further\r\ncorrection is necessary. In burning sulphuric acid the heat evolved per\r\ngram of sulphur is 2230 calories in excess of the heat which would be\r\nevolved if the sulphur burned to sulphur dioxide, or 22.3 calories for\r\neach per cent of sulphur in the coal. One cubic centimeter of the\r\nammonia solution is equivalent to 0.00286 grams of sulphur as sulphuric\r\nacid, or to 0.286 × 22.3 = 6.38 calories. It is evident therefore that\r\nafter multiplying the number of cubic centimeters used in titrating by\r\nthe heat factor for nitric acid (2.65) a further correction of\r\n6.38 - 2.65 = 3.73 is necessary for each cubic centimeter used in\r\ntitrating sulphuric instead of nitric acid. This correction will be\r\n3.73/0.297 = 13 units for each 0.01 gram of sulphur in the coal.\r\n\r\nThe total correction therefore for the aqueous nitric and sulphuric acid\r\nis found by multiplying the ammonia by 2.65 and adding 13 calories for\r\neach 0.01 gram of sulphur in the coal. This total correction is to be\r\ndeducted from the heat value as found from the corrected range and the\r\namount equivalent to the calorimeter.\r\n\r\nAfter each test the pan in which the coal has been burned must be\r\ncarefully examined to make sure that all of the sample has undergone\r\ncomplete combustion. The presence of black specks ordinarily indicates\r\nunburned coal, and often will be found where the coal contains bone or\r\nslate. Where such specks are found the tests should be repeated. In\r\ntesting any fuel where it is found difficult to completely consume a\r\nsample, a weighed amount of naphthaline may be added, the total weight\r\nof fuel and naphthaline being approximately one gram. The naphthaline\r\nhas a known heat of combustion, samples for this purpose being\r\nobtainable from the United States Bureau of Standards, and from the\r\ncombined heat of combustion of the fuel and naphthaline that of the\r\nformer may be readily computed.\r\n\r\nThe heat evolved in burning of a definite weight of standard naphthaline\r\nmay also be used as a means of calibrating the calorimeter as a whole.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMBUSTION OF COAL\r\n\r\n\r\nThe composition of coal varies over such a wide range, and the methods\r\nof firing have to be altered so greatly to suit the various coals and\r\nthe innumerable types of furnaces in which they are burned, that any\r\ninstructions given for the handling of different fuels must of necessity\r\nbe of the most general character. For each kind of coal there is some\r\nmethod of firing which will give the best results for each individual\r\nset of conditions. General rules can be suggested, but the best results\r\ncan be obtained only by following such methods as experience and\r\npractice show to be the best suited to the specific conditions.\r\n\r\nThe question of draft is an all important factor. If this be\r\ninsufficient, proper combustion is impossible, as the suction in the\r\nfurnace will not be great enough to draw the necessary amount of air\r\nthrough the fuel bed, and the gases may pass off only partially\r\nconsumed. On the other hand, an excessive draft may cause losses due to\r\nthe excess quantities of air drawn through holes in the fire. Where coal\r\nis burned however, there are rarely complaints from excessive draft, as\r\nthis can be and should be regulated by the boiler damper to give only\r\nthe draft necessary for the particular rate of combustion desired. The\r\ndraft required for various kinds of fuel is treated in detail in the\r\nchapter on \"Chimneys and Draft\". In this chapter it will be assumed that\r\nthe draft is at all times ample and that it is regulated to give the\r\nbest results for each kind of coal.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              TABLE 40\r\n\r\n                       ANTHRACITE COAL SIZES\r\n\r\n _________________________________________________________________\r\n|                           |                  |                  |\r\n|                           |                  | Testing Segments |\r\n|                           |    Round Mesh    | Standard Square  |\r\n|                           |                  |       Mesh       |\r\n|        Trade Name         |__________________|__________________|\r\n|                           |         |        |         |        |\r\n|                           | Through |  Over  | Through |  Over  |\r\n|                           | Inches  | Inches | Inches  | Inches |\r\n|___________________________|_________|________|_________|________|\r\n|                           |         |        |         |        |\r\n| Broken                    |  4-1/2  | 3-1/4  |  4      | 2-3/4  |\r\n| Egg                       |  3-1/4  | 2-3/8  |  2-3/4  | 2      |\r\n| Stove                     |  2-3/8  | 1-5/8  |  2      | 1-3/8  |\r\n| Chestnut                  |  1-5/8  |   7/8  |  1-3/8  |   3/4  |\r\n| Pea                       |    7/8  |   5/8  |    3/4  |   1/2  |\r\n| No. 1 Buckwheat           |    5/8  |   3/8  |    1/2  |   1/4  |\r\n| No. 2 Buckwheat or Rice   |    3/8  |   3/16 |    1/4  |   1/8  |\r\n| No. 3 Buckwheat or Barley |    3/16 |   3/32 |    1/8  |   1/16 |\r\n|___________________________|_________|________|_________|________|\r\n\r\nAnthracite--Anthracite coal is ordinarily marketed under the names and\r\nsizes given in Table 40.\r\n\r\nThe larger sizes of anthracite are rarely used for commercial steam\r\ngenerating purposes as the demand for domestic use now limits the\r\nsupply. In commercial plants the sizes generally found are Nos. 1, 2 and\r\n3 buckwheat. In some plants where the finer sizes are used, a small\r\npercentage of bituminous coal, say, 10 per cent, is sometimes mixed with\r\nthe anthracite and beneficial results secured both in economy and\r\ncapacity.\r\n\r\nAnthracite coal should be fired evenly, in small quantities and at\r\nfrequent intervals. If this method is not followed, dead spots will\r\nappear in the fire, and if the fire gets too irregular through burning\r\nin patches, nothing can be done to remedy it until the fire is cleaned\r\nas a whole. After this grade of fuel has been fired it should be left\r\nalone, and the fire tools used as little as possible. Owing to the\r\ndifficulty of igniting this fuel, care must be taken in cleaning fires.\r\nThe intervals of cleaning will, of course, depend upon the nature of the\r\ncoal and the rate of combustion. With the small sizes and moderately\r\nhigh combustion rates, fires will have to be cleaned twice on each\r\neight-hour shift. As the fires become dirty the thickness of the fuel\r\nbed will increase, until this depth may be 12 or 14 inches just before a\r\ncleaning period. In cleaning, the following practice is usually\r\nfollowed: The good coal on the forward half of the grate is pushed to\r\nthe rear half, and the refuse on the front portion either pulled out or\r\ndumped. The good coal is then pulled forward onto the front part of the\r\ngrate and the refuse on the rear section dumped. The remaining good coal\r\nis then spread evenly over the whole grate surface and the fire built up\r\nwith fresh coal.\r\n\r\nA ratio of grate surface to heating surface of 1 to from 35 to 40 will\r\nunder ordinary conditions develop the rated capacity of a boiler when\r\nburning anthracite buckwheat. Where the finer sizes are used, or where\r\noverloads are desirable, however, this ratio should preferably be 1 to\r\n25 and a forced blast should be used. Grates 10 feet deep with a slope\r\nof 1½ inches to the foot can be handled comfortably with this class of\r\nfuel, and grates 12 feet deep with the same slope can be successfully\r\nhandled. Where grates over 8 feet in depth are necessary, shaking grates\r\nor overlapping dumping grates should be used. Dumping grates may be\r\napplied either for the whole grate surface or to the rear section. Air\r\nopenings in the grate bars should be made from 3/16 inch in width for\r\nNo. 3 buckwheat to 5/16 inch for No. 1 buckwheat. It is important that\r\nthese air openings be uniformly distributed over the whole surface to\r\navoid blowing holes in the fire, and it is for this reason that\r\noverlapping grates are recommended.\r\n\r\nNo air should be admitted over the fire. Steam is sometimes introduced\r\ninto the ashpit to soften any clinker that may form, but the quantity of\r\nsteam should be limited to that required for this purpose. The steam\r\nthat may be used in a steam jet blower for securing blast will in\r\ncertain instances assist in softening the clinker, but a much greater\r\nquantity may be used by such an apparatus than is required for this\r\npurpose. Combustion arches sprung above the grates have proved of\r\nadvantage in maintaining a high furnace temperature and in assisting in\r\nthe ignition of fresh coal.\r\n\r\nStacks used with forced blast should be of such size as to insure a\r\nslight suction in the furnace under any conditions of operation. A blast\r\nup to 3 inches of water should be available for the finer sizes supplied\r\nby engine driven fans, automatically controlled by the boiler pressure.\r\nThe blast required will increase as the depth of the fuel bed increases,\r\nand the slight suction should be maintained in the furnace by damper\r\nregulation.\r\n\r\nThe use of blast with the finer sizes causes rapid fouling of the\r\nheating surfaces of the boiler, the dust often amounting to over 10 per\r\ncent of the total fuel fired. Economical disposal of dust and ashes is\r\nof the utmost importance in burning fuel of this nature. Provision\r\nshould be made in the baffling of the boiler to accommodate and dispose\r\nof this dust. Whenever conditions permit, the ashes can be economically\r\ndisposed of by flushing them out with water.\r\n\r\nBituminous Coals--There is no classification of bituminous coal as to\r\nsize that holds good in all localities. The American Society of\r\nMechanical Engineers suggests the following grading:\r\n\r\n\r\n_Eastern Bituminous Coals_--\r\n\r\n(A) Run of mine coal; the unscreened coal taken from the mine.\r\n\r\n(B) Lump coal; that which passes over a bar-screen with openings 1¼\r\n    inches wide.\r\n\r\n(C) Nut coal; that which passes through a bar-screen with 1¼-inch\r\n    openings and over one with ¾-inch openings.\r\n\r\n(D) Slack coal; that which passes through a bar-screen with ¾-inch\r\n    openings.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Western Bituminous Coals_--\r\n\r\n(E) Run of mine coal; the unscreened coal taken from the mine.\r\n\r\n(F) Lump coal; divided into 6-inch, 3-inch and 1¼-inch lump, according\r\n    to the diameter of the circular openings over which the respective\r\n    grades pass; also 6 × 3-inch lump and 3 × 1¼-inch lump, according as\r\n    the coal passes through a circular opening having the diameter of\r\n    the larger figure and over that of the smaller diameter.\r\n\r\n(G) Nut coal; divided into 3-inch steam nut, which passes through an\r\n    opening 3 inches diameter and over 1¼ inches; 1¼ inch nut, which\r\n    passes through a 1¼-inch diameter opening and over a ¾-inch\r\n    diameter opening; ¾-inch nut, which passes through a ¾-inch\r\n    diameter opening and over a 5/8-inch diameter opening.\r\n\r\n(H) Screenings; that which passes through a 1¼-inch diameter opening.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the variation in character of bituminous coals is much greater than\r\nin the anthracites, any rules set down for their handling must be the\r\nmore general. The difficulties in burning bituminous coals with economy\r\nand with little or no smoke increases as the content of fixed carbon in\r\nthe coal decreases. It is their volatile content which causes the\r\ndifficulties and it is essential that the furnaces be designed to\r\nproperly handle this portion of the coal. The fixed carbon will take\r\ncare of itself, provided the volatile matter is properly burned.\r\n\r\nMr. Kent, in his \"Steam Boiler Economy\", described the action of\r\nbituminous coal after it is fired as follows: \"The first thing that the\r\nfine fresh coal does is to choke the air spaces existing through the bed\r\nof coke, thus shutting off the air supply which is needed to burn the\r\ngases produced from the fresh coal. The next thing is a very rapid\r\nevaporation of moisture from the coal, a chilling process, which robs\r\nthe furnace of heat. Next is the formation of water-gas by the chemical\r\nreaction, C + H_{2}O = CO + 2H, the steam being decomposed, its oxygen\r\nburning the carbon of the coal to carbonic oxide, and the hydrogen being\r\nliberated. This reaction takes place when steam is brought in contact\r\nwith highly heated carbon. This also is a chilling process, absorbing\r\nheat from the furnaces. The two valuable fuel gases thus generated would\r\ngive back all the heat absorbed in their formation if they could be\r\nburned, but there is not enough air in the furnace to burn them.\r\nAdmitting extra air through the fire door at this time will be of no\r\nservice, for the gases being comparatively cool cannot be burned unless\r\nthe air is highly heated. After all the moisture has been driven off\r\nfrom the coal, the distillation of hydrocarbons begins, and a\r\nconsiderable portion of them escapes unburned, owing to the deficiency\r\nof hot air, and to their being chilled by the relatively cool heating\r\nsurfaces of the boiler. During all this time great volumes of smoke are\r\nescaping from the chimney, together with unburned hydrogen,\r\nhydrocarbons, and carbonic oxide, all fuel gases, while at the same time\r\nsoot is being deposited on the heating surface, diminishing its\r\nefficiency in transmitting heat to the water.\"\r\n\r\nTo burn these gases distilled from the coal, it is necessary that they\r\nbe brought into contact with air sufficiently heated to cause them to\r\nignite, that sufficient space be allowed for their mixture with the air,\r\nand that sufficient time be allowed for their complete combustion before\r\nthey strike the boiler heating surfaces, since these surfaces are\r\ncomparatively cool and will lower the temperature of the gases below\r\ntheir ignition point. The air drawn through the fire by the draft\r\nsuction is heated in its passage and heat is added by radiation from the\r\nhot brick surfaces of the furnace, the air and volatile gases mixing as\r\nthis increase in temperature is taking place. Thus in most instances is\r\nthe first requirement fulfilled. The element of space for the proper\r\nmixture of the gases with the air, and of time in which combustion is to\r\ntake place, should be taken care of by sufficiently large combustion\r\nchambers.\r\n\r\nCertain bituminous coals, owing to their high volatile content, require\r\nthat the air be heated to a higher temperature than it is possible for\r\nit to attain simply in its passage through the fire and by absorption\r\nfrom the side walls of the furnace. Such coals can be burned with the\r\nbest results under fire brick arches. Such arches increase the\r\ntemperature of the furnace and in this way maintain the heat that must\r\nbe present for ignition and complete combustion of the fuels in\r\nquestion. These fuels too, sometimes require additional combustion\r\nspace, and an extension furnace will give this in addition to the\r\nrequired arches.\r\n\r\nAs stated, the difficulty of burning bituminous coals successfully will\r\nincrease with the increase in volatile matter. This percentage of\r\nvolatile will affect directly the depth of coal bed to be carried and\r\nthe intervals of firing for the most satisfactory results. The variation\r\nin the fuel over such wide ranges makes it impossible to definitely\r\nstate the thickness of fires for all classes, and experiment with the\r\nclass of fuel in use is the best method of determining how that\r\nparticular fuel should be handled. The following suggestions, which are\r\nnot to be considered in any sense hard and fast rules, may be of service\r\nfor general operating conditions for hand firing:\r\n\r\nSemi-bituminous coals, such as Pocahontas, New River, Clearfield, etc.,\r\nrequire fires from 10 to 14 inches thick; fresh coal should be fired at\r\nintervals of 10 to 20 minutes and sufficient coal charged at each firing\r\nto maintain a uniform thickness. Bituminous coals from Pittsburgh Region\r\nrequire fires from 4 to 6 inches thick, and should be fired often in\r\ncomparatively small charges. Kentucky, Tennessee, Ohio and Illinois\r\ncoals require a thickness from 4 to 6 inches. Free burning coals from\r\nRock Springs, Wyoming, require from 6 to 8 inches, while the poorer\r\ngrades of Montana, Utah and Washington bituminous coals require a depth\r\nof about 4 inches.\r\n\r\nIn general as thin fires are found necessary, the intervals of firing\r\nshould be made more frequent and the quantity of coal fired at each\r\ninterval smaller. As thin fires become necessary due to the character of\r\nthe coal, the tendency to clinker will increase if the thickness be\r\nincreased over that found to give the best results.\r\n\r\nThere are two general methods of hand firing: 1st, the spreading method;\r\nand 2nd, the coking method.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Babcock & Wilcox Chain Grate Stoker]\r\n\r\nIn the spreading method but little fuel is fired at one time, and is\r\nspread evenly over the fuel bed from front to rear. Where there is more\r\nthan one firing door the doors should be fired alternately. The\r\nadvantage of alternate firing is the whole surface of the fire is not\r\nblanketed with green coal, and steam is generated more uniformly than if\r\nall doors were fired at one time. Again, a better combustion results due\r\nto the burning of more of the volatile matter directly after firing than\r\nwhere all doors are fired at one time.\r\n\r\nIn the coking method, fresh coal is fired at considerable depth at the\r\nfront of the grate and after it is partially coked it is pushed back\r\ninto the furnace. The object of such a method is the preserving of a bed\r\nof carbon at the rear of the grate, in passing over which the volatile\r\ngases driven off from the green coal will be burned. This method is\r\nparticularly adaptable to a grate in which the gases are made to pass\r\nhorizontally over the fire. Modern practice for hand firing leans more\r\nand more toward the spread firing method. Again the tendency is to work\r\nbituminous coal fires less than formerly. A certain amount of slicing\r\nand raking may be necessary with either method of firing, but in\r\ngeneral, the less the fire is worked the better the results.\r\n\r\nLignites--As the content of volatile matter and moisture in lignite is\r\nhigher than in bituminous coal, the difficulties encountered in burning\r\nthem are greater. A large combustion space is required and the best\r\nresults are obtained where a furnace of the reverberatory type is used,\r\ngiving the gases a long travel before meeting the tube surfaces. A fuel\r\nbed from 4 to 6 inches in depth can be maintained, and the coal should\r\nbe fired in small quantities by the alternate method. Above certain\r\nrates of combustion clinker forms rapidly, and a steam jet in the ashpit\r\nfor softening this clinker is often desirable. A considerable draft\r\nshould be available, but it should be carefully regulated by the boiler\r\ndamper to suit the condition of the fire. Smokelessness with hand firing\r\nwith this class of fuel is a practical impossibility. It has a strong\r\ntendency to foul the heating surfaces rapidly and these surfaces should\r\nbe cleaned frequently. Shaking grates, intelligently handled, aid in\r\ncleaning the fires, but their manipulation must be carefully watched to\r\nprevent good coal being lost in the ashpit.\r\n\r\nStokers--The term \"automatic stoker\" oftentimes conveys the erroneous\r\nimpression that such an apparatus takes care of itself, and it must be\r\nthoroughly understood that any stoker requires expert attention to as\r\nhigh if not higher degree than do hand-fired furnaces.\r\n\r\nStoker-fired furnaces have many advantages over hand firing, but where a\r\nstoker installation is contemplated there are many factors to be\r\nconsidered. It is true that stokers feed coal to the fire automatically,\r\nbut if the coal has first to be fed to the stoker hopper by hand, its\r\nautomatic advantage is lost. This is as true of the removal of ash from\r\na stoker. In a general way, it may be stated that a stoker installation\r\nis not advantageous except possibly for diminishing smoke, unless the\r\nautomatic feature is carried to the handling of the coal and ash, as\r\nwhere coal and ash handling apparatus is not installed there is no\r\nsaving in labor. In large plants, however, stokers used in conjunction\r\nwith the modern methods of coal storage and coal and ash handling, make\r\npossible a large labor saving. In small plants the labor saving for\r\nstokers over hand-fired furnaces is negligible, and the expense of the\r\ninstallation no less proportionately than in large plants. Stokers are,\r\ntherefore, advisable in small plants only where the saving in fuel will\r\nbe large, or where the smoke question is important.\r\n\r\nInterest on investment, repairs, depreciation and steam required for\r\nblast and stoker drive must all be considered. The upkeep cost will, in\r\ngeneral, be higher than for hand-fired furnaces. Stokers, however, make\r\npossible the use of cheaper fuels with as high or higher economy than is\r\nobtainable under operating conditions in hand-fired furnaces with a\r\nbetter grade of fuel. The better efficiency obtainable with a good\r\nstoker is due to more even and continuous firing as against the\r\nintermittent firing of hand-fired furnaces; constant air supply as\r\nagainst a variation in this supply to meet varying furnace conditions in\r\nhand-fired furnaces; and the doing away to a great extent with the\r\nnecessity of working the fires.\r\n\r\nStokers under ordinary operating conditions will give more nearly\r\nsmokeless combustion than will hand-fired furnaces and for this reason\r\nmust often be installed regardless of other considerations. While a\r\nconstant air supply for a given power is theoretically secured by the\r\nuse of a stoker, and in many instances the draft is automatically\r\ngoverned, the air supply should, nevertheless, be as carefully watched\r\nand checked by flue gas analyses as in the case of hand-fired furnaces.\r\n\r\nThere is a tendency in all stokers to cause the loss of some good fuel\r\nor siftings in the ashpit, but suitable arrangements may be made to\r\nreclaim this.\r\n\r\nIn respect to efficiency of combustion, other conditions being equal,\r\nthere will be no appreciable difference with the different types of\r\nstokers, provided that the proper type is used for the grade of fuel to\r\nbe burned and the conditions of operation to be fulfilled. No stoker\r\nwill satisfactorily handle all classes of fuel, and in making a\r\nselection, care should be taken that the type is suited to the fuel and\r\nthe operating conditions. A cheap stoker is a poor investment. Only the\r\nbest stoker suited to the conditions which are to be met should be\r\nadopted, for if there is to be a saving, it will more than cover the\r\ncost of the best over the cheaper stoker.\r\n\r\nMechanical Stokers are of three general types: 1st, overfeed; 2nd,\r\nunderfeed; and 3rd, traveling grate. The traveling grate stokers are\r\nsometimes classed as overfeed but properly should be classed by\r\nthemselves as under certain conditions they are of the underfeed rather\r\nthan the overfeed type.\r\n\r\nOverfeed Stokers in general may be divided into two classes, the\r\ndistinction being in the direction in which the coal is fed relative to\r\nthe furnaces. In one class the coal is fed into hoppers at the front end\r\nof the furnace onto grates with an inclination downward toward the rear\r\nof about 45 degrees. These grates are reciprocated, being made to take\r\nalternately level and inclined positions and this motion gradually\r\ncarries the fuel as it is burned toward the rear and bottom of the\r\nfurnace. At the bottom of the grates flat dumping sections are supplied\r\nfor completing the combustion and for cleaning. The fuel is partly\r\nburned or coked on the upper portion of the grates, the volatile gases\r\ndriven off in this process for a perfect action being ignited and burned\r\nin their passage over the bed of burning carbon lower on the grates, or\r\non becoming mixed with the hot gases in the furnace chamber. In the\r\nsecond class the fuel is fed from the sides of the furnace for its full\r\ndepth from front to rear onto grates inclined toward the center of the\r\nfurnace. It is moved by rocking bars and is gradually carried to the\r\nbottom and center of the furnace as combustion advances. Here some type\r\nof a so-called clinker breaker removes the refuse.\r\n\r\nUnderfeed Stokers are either horizontal or inclined. The fuel is fed\r\nfrom underneath, either continuously by a screw, or intermittently by\r\nplungers. The principle upon which these stokers base their claims for\r\nefficiency and smokelessness is that the green fuel is fed under the\r\ncoked and burning coal, the volatile gases from this fresh fuel being\r\nheated and ignited in their passage through the hottest portion of the\r\nfire on the top. In the horizontal classes of underfeed stokers, the\r\naction of a screw carries the fuel back through a retort from which it\r\npasses upward, as the fuel above is consumed, the ash being finally\r\ndeposited on dead plates on either side of the retort, from which it can\r\nbe removed. In the inclined class, the refuse is carried downward to the\r\nrear of the furnace where there are dumping plates, as in some of the\r\noverfeed types.\r\n\r\nUnderfeed stokers are ordinarily operated with a forced blast, this in\r\nsome cases being operated by the same mechanism as the stoker drive,\r\nthus automatically meeting the requirements of various combustion rates.\r\n\r\nTraveling Grates are of the class best illustrated by chain grate\r\nstokers. As implied by the name these consist of endless grates composed\r\nof short sections of bars, passing over sprockets at the front and rear\r\nof the furnace. Coal is fed by gravity onto the forward end of the\r\ngrates through suitable hoppers, is ignited under ignition arches and is\r\ncarried with the grate toward the rear of the furnace as its combustion\r\nprogresses. When operated properly, the combustion is completed as the\r\nfire reaches the end of the grate and the refuse is carried over this\r\nrear end by the grate in making the turn over the rear sprocket. In some\r\ncases auxiliary dumping grates at the rear of the chain grates are used\r\nwith success.\r\n\r\nChain grate stokers in general produce less smoke than either overfeed\r\nor underfeed types, due to the fact that there are no cleaning periods\r\nnecessary. Such periods occur with the latter types of stokers at\r\nintervals depending upon the character of the fuel used and the rate of\r\ncombustion. With chain grate stokers the cleaning is continuous and\r\nautomatic, and no periods occur when smoke will necessarily be produced.\r\n\r\nIn the earlier forms, chain grates had an objectionable feature in that\r\nthe admission of large amounts of excess air at the rear of the furnace\r\nthrough the grates was possible. This objection has been largely\r\novercome in recent models by the use of some such device as the bridge\r\nwall water box and suitable dampers. A distinct advantage of chain\r\ngrates over other types is that they can be withdrawn from the furnace\r\nfor inspection or repairs without interfering in any way with the boiler\r\nsetting.\r\n\r\nThis class of stoker is particularly successful in burning low grades of\r\ncoal running high in ash and volatile matter which can only be burned\r\nwith difficulty on the other types. The cost of up-keep in a chain\r\ngrate, properly constructed and operated, is low in comparison with the\r\nsame cost for other stokers.\r\n\r\nThe Babcock & Wilcox chain grate is representative of this design of\r\nstoker.\r\n\r\nSmoke--The question of smoke and smokelessness in burning fuels has\r\nrecently become a very important factor of the problem of combustion.\r\nCities and communities throughout the country have passed ordinances\r\nrelative to the quantities of smoke that may be emitted from a stack,\r\nand the failure of operators to live up to the requirements of such\r\nordinances, resulting as it does in fines and annoyance, has brought\r\ntheir attention forcibly to the matter.\r\n\r\nThe whole question of smoke and smokelessness is to a large extent a\r\ncomparative one. There are any number of plants burning a wide variety\r\nof fuels in ordinary hand-fired furnaces, in extension furnaces and on\r\nautomatic stokers that are operating under service conditions,\r\npractically without smoke. It is safe to say, however, that no plant\r\nwill operate smokelessly under any and all conditions of service, nor is\r\nthere a plant in which the degree of smokelessness does not depend\r\nlargely upon the intelligence of the operating force.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 26. Babcock & Wilcox Boiler and Superheater Equipped\r\nwith Babcock & Wilcox Chain Grate Stoker. This Setting has been\r\nParticularly Successful in Minimizing Smoke]\r\n\r\nWhen a condition arises in a boiler room requiring the fires to be\r\nbrought up quickly, the operatives in handling certain types of stokers\r\nwill use their slice bars freely to break up the green portion of the\r\nfire over the bed of partially burned coal. In fact, when a load is\r\nsuddenly thrown on a station the steam pressure can often be maintained\r\nonly in this way, and such use of the slice bar will cause smoke with\r\nthe very best type of stoker. In a certain plant using a highly volatile\r\ncoal and operating boilers equipped with ordinary hand-fired furnaces,\r\nextension hand-fired furnaces and stokers, in which the boilers with the\r\ndifferent types of furnaces were on separate stacks, a difference in\r\nsmoke from the different types of furnaces was apparent at light loads,\r\nbut when a heavy load was thrown on the plant, all three stacks would\r\nsmoke to the same extent, and it was impossible to judge which type of\r\nfurnace was on one or the other of the stacks.\r\n\r\nIn hand-fired furnaces much can be accomplished by proper firing. A\r\ncombination of the alternate and spreading methods should be used, the\r\ncoal being fired evenly, quickly, lightly and often, and the fires\r\nworked as little as possible. Smoke can be diminished by giving the\r\ngases a long travel under the action of heated brickwork before they\r\nstrike the boiler heating surfaces. Air introduced over the fires and\r\nthe use of heated arches, etc., for mingling the air with the gases\r\ndistilled from the coal will also diminish smoke. Extension furnaces\r\nwill undoubtedly lessen smoke where hand firing is used, due to the\r\nincrease in length of gas travel and the fact that this travel is\r\npartially under heated brickwork. Where hand-fired grates are\r\nimmediately under the boiler tubes, and a high volatile coal is used, if\r\nsufficient combustion space is not provided the volatile gases,\r\ndistilled as soon as the coal is thrown on the fire, strike the tube\r\nsurfaces and are cooled below the burning point before they are wholly\r\nconsumed and pass through as smoke. With an extension furnace, these\r\nvolatile gases are acted upon by the radiant heat from the extension\r\nfurnace arch and this heat, together with the added length of travel\r\ncauses their more complete combustion before striking the heating\r\nsurfaces than in the former case.\r\n\r\nSmoke may be diminished by employing a baffle arrangement which gives\r\nthe gases a fairly long travel under heated brickwork and by introducing\r\nair above the fire. In many cases, however, special furnaces for smoke\r\nreduction are installed at the expense of capacity and economy.\r\n\r\nFrom the standpoint of smokelessness, undoubtedly the best results are\r\nobtained with a good stoker, properly operated. As stated above, the\r\nbest stoker will cause smoke under certain conditions. Intelligently\r\nhandled, however, under ordinary operating conditions, stoker-fired\r\nfurnaces are much more nearly smokeless than those which are hand fired,\r\nand are, to all intents and purposes, smokeless. In practically all\r\nstoker installations there enters the element of time for combustion,\r\nthe volatile gases as they are distilled being acted upon by ignition or\r\nother arches before they strike the heating surfaces. In many instances\r\ntoo, stokers are installed with an extension beyond the boiler front,\r\nwhich gives an added length of travel during which, the gases are acted\r\nupon by the radiant heat from the ignition or supplementary arches, and\r\nhere again we see the long travel giving time for the volatile gases to\r\nbe properly consumed.\r\n\r\nTo repeat, it must be emphatically borne in mind that the question of\r\nsmokelessness is largely one of degree, and dependent to an extent much\r\ngreater than is ordinarily appreciated upon the handling of the fuel and\r\nthe furnaces by the operators, be these furnaces hand fired or\r\nautomatically fired.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 3520 Horse-power Installation of Babcock & Wilcox Boilers\r\nat the Portland Railway, Light and Power Co., Portland, Ore.

When newly cut, wood contains\r\nmoisture varying from 30 per cent to 50 per cent. When dried for a\r\nperiod of about a year in the atmosphere, the moisture content will be\r\nreduced to 18 or 20 per cent.\r\n\r\n                         TABLE 41\r\n\r\nULTIMATE ANALYSES AND CALORIFIC VALUES OF DRY WOOD (GOTTLIEB)\r\n\r\n _______________________________________________________\r\n|        |       |      |      |       |      |         |\r\n| Kind   |       |      |      |       |      | B. t. u.|\r\n|  of    |   C   |  H   |  N   |   O   | Ash  |  per    |\r\n| Wood   |       |      |      |       |      | Pound   |\r\n|________|_______|______|______|_______|______|_________|\r\n|        |       |      |      |       |      |         |\r\n| Oak    | 50.16 | 6.02 | 0.09 | 43.36 | 0.37 | 8316    |\r\n| Ash    | 49.18 | 6.27 | 0.07 | 43.91 | 0.57 | 8480    |\r\n| Elm    | 48.99 | 6.20 | 0.06 | 44.25 | 0.50 | 8510    |\r\n| Beech  | 49.06 | 6.11 | 0.09 | 44.17 | 0.57 | 8391    |\r\n| Birch  | 48.88 | 6.06 | 0.10 | 44.67 | 0.29 | 8586    |\r\n| Fir    | 50.36 | 5.92 | 0.05 | 43.39 | 0.28 | 9063    |\r\n| Pine   | 50.31 | 6.20 | 0.04 | 43.08 | 0.37 | 9153    |\r\n| Poplar | 49.37 | 6.21 | 0.96 | 41.60 | 1.86 | 7834[40]|\r\n| Willow | 49.96 | 5.96 | 0.96 | 39.56 | 3.37 | 7926[40]|\r\n|________|_______|______|______|_______|______|_________|\r\n\r\nWood is usually classified as hard wood, including oak, maple, hickory,\r\nbirch, walnut and beech; and soft wood, including pine, fir, spruce,\r\nelm, chestnut, poplar and willow. Contrary to general opinion, the heat\r\nvalue per pound of soft wood is slightly greater than the same value per\r\npound of hard wood. Table 41 gives the chemical composition and the heat\r\nvalues of the common woods. Ordinarily the heating value of wood is\r\nconsidered equivalent to 0.4 that of bituminous coal. In considering the\r\ncalorific value of wood as given in this table, it is to be remembered\r\nthat while this value is based on air-dried wood, the moisture content\r\nis still about 20 per cent of the whole, and the heat produced in\r\nburning it will be diminished by this amount and by the heat required to\r\nevaporate the moisture and superheat it to the temperature of the gases.\r\nThe heat so absorbed may be calculated by the formula giving the loss\r\ndue to moisture in the fuel, and the net calorific value determined.\r\n\r\nIn designing furnaces for burning wood, the question resolves itself\r\ninto: 1st, the essential elements to give maximum capacity and\r\nefficiency with this class of fuel; and 2nd, the construction which will\r\nentail the least labor in handling and feeding the fuel and removing the\r\nrefuse after combustion.\r\n\r\nWood, as used commercially for steam generating purposes, is usually a\r\nwaste product from some industrial process. At the present time refuse\r\nfrom lumber and sawmills forms by far the greater part of this class of\r\nfuel. In such refuse the moisture may run as high as 60 per cent and the\r\ncomposition of the fuel may vary over wide ranges during different\r\nportions of the mill operation. The fuel consists of sawdust, \"hogged\"\r\nwood and slabs, and the percentage of each of these constituents may\r\nvary greatly. Hogged wood is mill refuse and logs that have been passed\r\nthrough a \"hogging machine\" or macerator. This machine, through the\r\naction of revolving knives, cuts or shreds the wood into a state in\r\nwhich it may readily be handled as fuel.\r\n\r\nTable 42 gives the moisture content and heat value of typical sawmill\r\nrefuse from various woods.\r\n\r\n                               TABLE 42\r\n\r\n            MOISTURE AND CALORIFIC VALUE OF SAWMILL REFUSE\r\n _____________________________________________________________________\r\n|                     |                       |          |            |\r\n|                     |                       | Per Cent |  B. t. u.  |\r\n|    Kind of Wood     |   Nature of Refuse    | Moisture | per Pound  |\r\n|                     |                       |          |  Dry Fuel  |\r\n|_____________________|_______________________|__________|____________|\r\n|                     |                       |          |            |\r\n| Mexican White Pine  | Sawdust and Hog Chips |   51.90  |   9020     |\r\n| Yosemite Sugar Pine | Sawdust and Hog Chips |   62.85  |   9010     |\r\n| Redwood 75%,        | Sawdust, Box Mill     |          |            |\r\n|   Douglas Fir 25%   |   Refuse and Hog      |   42.20  |   8977[41] |\r\n| Redwood             | Sawdust and Hog Chips |   52.98  |   9040[41] |\r\n| Redwood             | Sawdust and Hog Chips |   49.11  |   9204[41] |\r\n| Fir, Hemlock,       |                       |          |            |\r\n|   Spruce and Cedar  | Sawdust               |   42.06  |   8949[41] |\r\n|_____________________|_______________________|__________|____________|\r\n\r\nIt is essential in the burning of this class of fuel that a large\r\ncombustion space be supplied, and on account of the usually high\r\nmoisture content there should be much heated brickwork to radiate heat\r\nto the fuel bed and thus evaporate the moisture. Extension furnaces of\r\nthe proper size are usually essential for good results and when this\r\nfuel is used alone, grates dropped to the floor line with an ashpit\r\nbelow give additional volume for combustion and space for maintaining a\r\nthick fuel bed. A thick fuel bed is necessary in order to avoid\r\nexcessive quantities of air passing through the boiler. Where the fuel\r\nconsists of hogged wood and sawdust alone, it is best to feed it\r\nautomatically into the furnace through chutes on the top of the\r\nextension. The best results are secured when the fuel is allowed to pile\r\nup in the furnace to a height of 3 or 4 feet in the form of a cone under\r\neach chute. The fuel burns best when not disturbed in the furnace. Each\r\nfuel chute, when a proper distance from the grates and with the piles\r\nmaintained at their proper height, will supply about 30 or 35 square\r\nfeet of grate surface. While large quantities of air are required for\r\nburning this fuel, excess air is as harmful as with coal, and care must\r\nbe taken that such an excess is not admitted through fire doors or fuel\r\nchutes. A strong natural draft usually is preferable to a blast with\r\nthis fuel. The action of blast is to make the regulation of the furnace\r\nconditions more difficult and to blow over unconsumed fuel on the\r\nheating surfaces and into the stack. This unconsumed fuel settling in\r\nportions of the setting out of the direct path of the gases will have a\r\ntendency to ignite provided any air reaches it, with results harmful to\r\nthe setting and breeching connection. This action is particularly\r\nobjectionable if these particles are carried over into the base of a\r\nstack, where they will settle below the point at which the flue enters\r\nand if ignited may cause the stack to become overheated and buckle.\r\n\r\nWhether natural draft or blast is used, much of the fuel is carried onto\r\nthe heating surfaces and these should be cleaned regularly to maintain a\r\ngood efficiency. Collecting chambers in various portions of the setting\r\nshould be provided for this unconsumed fuel, and these should be kept\r\nclean.\r\n\r\nWith proper draft conditions, 150 pounds of this fuel containing about\r\n30 to 40 per cent of moisture can be burned per square foot of grate\r\nsurface per hour, and in a properly designed furnace one square foot of\r\ngrate surface can develop from 5 to 6 boiler horse power. Where the wood\r\ncontains 50 per cent of moisture or over, it is not usually safe to\r\nfigure on obtaining more than 3 to 4 horse power per square foot of\r\ngrate surface.\r\n\r\nDry sawdust, chips and blocks are also used as fuel in many wood-working\r\nindustries. Here, as with the wet wood, ample combustion space should be\r\nsupplied, but as this fuel is ordinarily kiln dried, large brickwork\r\nsurfaces in the furnace are not necessary for the evaporation of\r\nmoisture in the fuel. This fuel may be burned in extension furnaces\r\nthough these are not required unless they are necessary to secure an\r\nadded furnace volume, to get in sufficient grate surface, or where such\r\nan arrangement must be used to allow for a fuel bed of sufficient\r\nthickness. Depth of fuel bed with the dry fuel is as important as with\r\nthe moist fuel. If extension furnaces are used with this dry wood, care\r\nmust be taken in their design that there is no excessive throttling of\r\nthe gases in the furnace, or brickwork trouble will result. In Babcock &\r\nWilcox boilers this fuel may be burned without extension furnaces,\r\nprovided that the boilers are set at a sufficient height to provide\r\nample combustion space and to allow for proper depth of fuel bed.\r\nSometimes this is gained by lowering the grates to the floor line and\r\nexcavating for an ashpit. Where the fuel is largely sawdust, it may be\r\nintroduced over the fire doors through inclined chutes. The old methods\r\nof handling and collecting sawdust by means of air suction and blast\r\nwere such that the amount of air admitted through such chutes was\r\nexcessive, but with improved methods the amount of air so admitted may\r\nbe reduced to a negligible quantity. The blocks and refuse which cannot\r\nbe handled through chutes may be fired through fire doors in the front\r\nof the boiler, which should be made sufficiently large to accommodate\r\nthe larger sizes of fuel. As with wet fuel, there will be a quantity of\r\nunconsumed wood carried over and the heating surfaces must be kept\r\nclean.\r\n\r\nIn a few localities cord wood is burned. With this as with other classes\r\nof wood fuel, a large combustion space is an essential feature. The\r\npercentage of moisture in cord wood may make it necessary to use an\r\nextension furnace, but ordinarily this is not required. Ample combustion\r\nspace is in most cases secured by dropping the grates to the floor line,\r\nlarge double-deck fire doors being supplied at the usual fire door level\r\nthrough which the wood is thrown by hand. Air is admitted under the\r\ngrates through an excavated ashpit. The side, front and rear walls of\r\nthe furnace should be corbelled out to cover about one-third of the\r\ntotal grate surface. This prevents cold air from laneing up the sides of\r\nthe furnace and also reduces the grate surface. Cord wood and slabs form\r\nan open fire through which the frictional loss of the air is much less\r\nthan in the case of sawdust or hogged material. The combustion rate with\r\ncord wood is, therefore, higher and the grate surface may be\r\nconsiderably reduced. Such wood is usually cut in lengths of 4 feet or 4\r\nfeet 6 inches, and the depth of the grates should be kept approximately\r\n5 feet to get the best results.\r\n\r\nBagasse--Bagasse is the refuse of sugar cane from which the juice has\r\nbeen extracted by pressure between the rolls of the mill. From the start\r\nof the sugar industry bagasse has been considered the natural fuel for\r\nsugar plantations, and in view of the importance of the industry a word\r\nof history relative to the use of this fuel is not out of place.\r\n\r\nWhen the manufacture of sugar was in its infancy the cane was passed\r\nthrough but a single mill and the defecation and concentration of the\r\nsaccharine juice took place in a series of vessels mounted one after\r\nanother over a common fire at one end and connected to a stack at the\r\nopposite end. This primitive method was known in the English colonies as\r\nthe \"Open Wall\" and in the Spanish-American countries as the \"Jamaica\r\nTrain\".\r\n\r\nThe evaporation and concentration of the juice in the open air and over\r\na direct fire required such quantities of fuel, and the bagasse, in\r\nfact, played such an important part in the manufacture of sugar, that\r\noftentimes the degree of extraction, which was already low, would be\r\nsacrificed to the necessity of obtaining a bagasse that might be readily\r\nburned.\r\n\r\nThe furnaces in use with these methods were as primitive as the rest of\r\nthe apparatus, and the bagasse could be burned in them only by first\r\ndrying it. This naturally required an enormous quantity of handling of\r\nthe fuel in spreading and collecting and frequently entailed a shutting\r\ndown of the mill, because a shower would spoil the supply which had been\r\ndried.\r\n\r\nThe difficulties arising from the necessity of drying this fuel caused a\r\nwidespread attempt on the part of inventors to the turning out of a\r\nfurnace which would successfully burn green bagasse. Some of the designs\r\nwere more or less clever, and about the year 1880 several such green\r\nbagasse furnaces were installed. These did not come up to expectations,\r\nhowever, and almost invariably they were abandoned and recourse had to\r\nbe taken to the old method of drying in the sun.\r\n\r\nFrom 1880 the new era in the sugar industry may be dated. Slavery was\r\nalmost universally abolished and it became necessary to pay for labor.\r\nThe cost of production was thus increased, while growing competition of\r\nEuropean beet sugar lowered the prices. The only remedy for the new\r\nstate of affairs was the cheapening of the production by the increase of\r\nextraction and improvement in manufacture. The double mill took the\r\nplace of the single, the open wall method of extraction was replaced by\r\nvacuum evaporative apparatus and centrifugal machines were introduced to\r\ndo the work of the great curing houses. As opposed to these\r\nimprovements, however, the steam plants remained as they started,\r\nconsisting of double flue boilers externally fired with dry bagasse.\r\n\r\nOn several of the plantations horizontal multitubular boilers externally\r\nfired were installed and at the time were considered the acme of\r\nperfection. Numerous attempts were made to burn the bagasse green, among\r\nothers the step grates imported from Louisiana and known as the Leon\r\nMarie furnaces, but satisfactory results were obtained in none of the\r\nappliances tried.\r\n\r\nThe Babcock & Wilcox Co. at this time turned their attention to the\r\nproblem with the results which ultimately led to its solution. Their New\r\nOrleans representative, Mr. Frederick Cook, invented a hot forced blast\r\nbagasse furnace and conveyed the patent rights to this company. This\r\nfurnace while not as efficient as the standard of to-day, and expensive\r\nin its construction, did, nevertheless, burn the bagasse green and\r\nenabled the boilers to develop their normal rated capacity. The first\r\nfurnace of this type was installed at the Southwood and Mt. Houmas\r\nplantations and on a small plantation in Florida. About the year 1888\r\ntwo furnaces were erected in Cuba, one on the plantation Senado and the\r\nother at the Central Hormiguero. The results obtained with these\r\nfurnaces were so remarkable in comparison with what had previously been\r\naccomplished that the company was overwhelmed with orders. The expense\r\nof auxiliary fuel, usually wood, which was costly and indispensable in\r\nrainy weather, was done away with and as the mill could be operated on\r\nbagasse alone, the steam production and the factory work could be\r\nregulated with natural increase in daily output.\r\n\r\nProgress and improvement in the manufacture itself was going on at a\r\nremarkable rate, the single grinding had been replaced by a double\r\ngrinding, this in turn by a third grinding, and finally the maceration\r\nand dilution of the bagasse was carried to the extraction of practically\r\nthe last trace of sugar contained in it. The quantity of juice to be\r\ntreated was increased in this way 20 or 30 per cent but was accompanied\r\nby the reduction to a minimum of the bagasse available as a fuel, and\r\nled to demands upon the furnace beyond its capacity.\r\n\r\nWith the improvements in the manufacture, planters had been compelled to\r\nmake enormous sacrifices to change radically their systems, and the\r\nheavy disbursement necessary for mill apparatus left few in a financial\r\nposition to make costly installations of good furnaces. The necessity of\r\nturning to something cheap in furnace construction but which was\r\nnevertheless better than the early method of burning the fuel dry led to\r\nthe invention of numerous furnaces by all classes of engineers\r\nregardless of their knowledge of the subject and based upon no\r\nexperience. None of the furnaces thus produced were in any sense\r\ninventions but were more or less barefaced infringements of the patents\r\nof The Babcock & Wilcox Co. As the company could not protect its rights\r\nwithout hurting its clients, who in many cases against their own will\r\nwere infringing upon these patents, and as on the other hand they were\r\nanxious to do something to meet the wants of the planters, a series of\r\nexperiments were started, at their own rather than at their customers'\r\nexpense, with a view to developing a furnace which, without being as\r\nexpensive, would still fulfill all the requirements of the manufacturer.\r\nThe result was the cold blast green bagasse furnace which is now\r\noffered, and it has been adopted as standard for this class of work\r\nafter years of study and observation in our installations in the sugar\r\ncountries of the world. Such a furnace is described later in considering\r\nthe combustion of bagasse.\r\n\r\nComposition and Calorific Value of Bagasse--The proportion of fiber\r\ncontained in the cane and density of the juice are important factors in\r\nthe relation the bagasse fuel will have to the total fuel necessary to\r\ngenerate the steam required in a mill's operation. A cane rich in wood\r\nfiber produces more bagasse than a poor one and a thicker juice is\r\nsubject to a higher degree of dilution than one not so rich.\r\n\r\nBesides the percentage of bagasse in the cane, its physical condition\r\nhas a bearing on its calorific value. The factors here entering are the\r\nage at which the cane must be cut, the locality in which it is grown,\r\netc. From the analysis of any sample of bagasse its approximate\r\ncalorific value may be calculated from the formula,\r\n\r\n                             8550F + 7119S + 6750G - 972W\r\nB. t. u. per pound bagasse = ----------------------------      (22)\r\n                                          100\r\n\r\nWhere F = per cent of fiber in cane, S = per cent sucrose, G = per cent\r\nglucose, W = per cent water.\r\n\r\nThis formula gives the total available heat per pound of bagasse, that\r\nis, the heat generated per pound less the heat required to evaporate its\r\nmoisture and superheat the steam thus formed to the temperature of the\r\nstack gases.\r\n\r\nThree samples of bagasse in which the ash is assumed to be 3 per cent\r\ngive from the formula:\r\n\r\nF = 50     S and G = 4.5  W = 42.5  B. t. u. = 4183\r\nF = 40     S and G = 6.0  W = 51.0  B. t. u. = 3351\r\nF = 33.3   S and G = 7.0  W = 56.7  B. t. u. = 2797\r\n\r\nA sample of Java bagasse having F = 46.5, S = 4.50, G = 0.5, W = 47.5\r\ngives B. t. u. 3868.\r\n\r\nThese figures show that the dryer the bagasse is crushed, the higher the\r\ncalorific value, though this is accompanied by a decrease in sucrose.\r\nThe explanation lies in the fact that the presence of sucrose in an\r\nanalysis is accompanied by a definite amount of water, and that the\r\nresidual juice contains sufficient organic substance to evaporate the\r\nwater present when a fuel is burned in a furnace. For example, assume\r\nthe residual juice (100 per cent) to contain 12 per cent organic matter.\r\nFrom the constant in formula,\r\n\r\n12×7119             (100-12)×972\r\n------- = 854.3 and ------------ = 855.4.\r\n  100                   100\r\n\r\nThat is, the moisture in a juice containing 12 per cent of sugar will be\r\nevaporated by the heat developed by the combustion of the contained\r\nsugar. It would, therefore, appear that a bagasse containing such juice\r\nhas a calorific value due only to its fiber content. This is, of course,\r\ntrue only where the highest products of oxidization are formed during\r\nthe combustion of the organic matter. This is not strictly the case,\r\nespecially with a bagasse of a high moisture content which will not burn\r\nproperly but which smoulders and produces a large quantity of products\r\nof destructive distillation, chiefly heavy hydrocarbons, which escape\r\nunburnt. The reasoning, however, is sufficient to explain the steam\r\nmaking properties of bagasse of a low sucrose content, such as are\r\nsecured in Java, as when the sucrose content is lower, the heat value is\r\nincreased by extracting more juice, and hence more sugar from it. The\r\nsugar operations in Java exemplify this and show that with a high\r\ndilution by maceration and heavy pressure the bagasse meets all of the\r\nsteam requirements of the mills without auxiliary fuel.\r\n\r\nA high percentage of silica or salts in bagasse has sometimes been\r\nascribed as the reason for the tendency to smoulder in certain cases of\r\nsoft fiber bagasse. This, however, is due to the large moisture content\r\nof the sample resulting directly from the nature of the cane. Soluble\r\nsalts in the bagasse has also been given as the explanation of such\r\nsmouldering action of the fire, but here too the explanation lies solely\r\nin the high moisture content, this resulting in the development of only\r\nsufficient heat to evaporate the moisture.\r\n\r\n                               TABLE 43\r\n\r\n               ANALYSES AND CALORIFIC VALUES OF BAGASSE\r\n+---------------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n|+----------+--------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+|\r\n||          |        |       |       |       |       |       |B.t.u. ||\r\n||          |        |       |       |       |       |       |  per  ||\r\n||  Source  |Moisture|   C   |   H   |   O   |   N   |  Ash  | Pound ||\r\n||          |        |       |       |       |       |       |  Dry  ||\r\n||          |        |       |       |       |       |       |Bagasse||\r\n|+----------+--------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+|\r\n||Cuba      | 51.50  | 43.15 | 6.00  | 47.95 |       | 2.90  | 7985  ||\r\n||Cuba      | 49.10  | 43.74 | 6.08  | 48.61 |       | 1.57  | 8300  ||\r\n||Cuba      | 42.50  | 43.61 | 6.06  | 48.45 |       | 1.88  | 8240  ||\r\n||Cuba      | 51.61  | 46.80 | 5.34  | 46.35 |       | 1.51  |       ||\r\n||Cuba      | 52.80  | 46.78 | 5.74  | 45.38 |       | 2.10  |       ||\r\n||Porto Rico| 41.60  | 44.28 | 6.66  | 47.10 | 0.41  | 1.35  | 8359  ||\r\n||Porto Rico| 43.50  | 44.21 | 6.31  | 47.72 | 0.41  | 1.35  | 8386  ||\r\n||Porto Rico| 44.20  | 44.92 | 6.27  | 46.50 | 0.41  | 1.90  | 8380  ||\r\n||Louisiana | 52.10  |       |       |       |       | 2.27  | 8230  ||\r\n||Louisiana | 54.00  |       |       |       |       |       | 8370  ||\r\n||Louisiana | 51.80  |       |       |       |       |       | 8371  ||\r\n||Java      |        | 46.03 | 6.56  | 45.55 | 0.18  | 1.68  | 8681  ||\r\n|+----------+--------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+|\r\n+---------------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n\r\nTable 43 gives the analyses and heat values of bagasse from various\r\nlocalities.

As the general efficiency of a plant of this\r\ndescription is measured by the amount of auxiliary fuel required per ton\r\nof cane, the relative importance of the furnace design for the burning\r\nof this fuel is apparent.\r\n\r\nIn modern practice, under certain conditions of mill operation, and with\r\nbagasse of certain physical properties, the bagasse available from the\r\ncane ground will meet the total steam requirements of the plant as a\r\nwhole; such conditions prevail, as described, in Java. In the United\r\nStates, Cuba, Porto Rico and like countries, however, auxiliary fuel is\r\nalmost universally a necessity. The amount will vary, depending to a\r\ngreat extent upon the proportion of fiber in the cane, which varies\r\nwidely with the locality and with the age at which it is cut, and to a\r\nlesser extent upon the degree of purity of the manufactured sugar, the\r\nuse of the maceration water and the efficiency of the mill apparatus as\r\na whole.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 27. Babcock & Wilcox Boiler Set with Green Bagasse\r\nFurnace]\r\n\r\nExperience has shown that this fuel may be burned with the best results\r\nin large quantities. A given amount of bagasse burned in one furnace\r\nbetween two boilers will give better results than the same quantity\r\nburned in a number of smaller furnaces. An objection has been raised\r\nagainst such practice on the grounds that the necessity of shutting down\r\ntwo boiler units when it is necessary for any reason to take off a\r\nfurnace, requires a larger combined boiler capacity to insure continuity\r\nof service. As a matter of fact, several small furnaces will cost\r\nconsiderably more than one large furnace, and the saving in original\r\nfurnace cost by such an installation, taken in conjunction with the\r\nadded efficiency of the larger furnace over the small, will probably\r\nmore than offset the cost of additional boiler units for spares.\r\n\r\nThe essential features in furnace design for this class of fuel are\r\nample combustion space and a length of gas travel sufficient to enable\r\nthe gases to be completely burned before the boiler heating surfaces are\r\nencountered. Experience has shown that better results are secured where\r\nthe fuel is burned on a hearth rather than on grates, the objection to\r\nthe latter method being that the air for combustion enters largely\r\naround the edges, where the fuel pile is thinnest. When burned on a\r\nhearth the air for combustion is introduced into the furnace through\r\nseveral rows of tuyeres placed above and symmetrically around the\r\nhearth. An arrangement of such tuyeres over a grate, and a proper\r\nmanipulation of the ashpit doors, will overcome largely the objection to\r\ngrates and at the same time enable other fuel to be burned in the\r\nfurnace when necessary. This arrangement of grates and tuyeres is\r\nprobably the better from a commercially efficient standpoint. Where the\r\nair is admitted through tuyeres over the grate or hearth line, it\r\nimpinges on the fuel pile as a whole and causes a uniform combustion.\r\nSuch tuyeres connect with an annular space in which, where a blast is\r\nused, the air pressure is controlled by a blower.\r\n\r\nAll experience with this class of fuel indicates that the best results\r\nare secured with high combustion rates. With a natural draft in the\r\nfurnace of, say, three-tenths inch of water, a combustion rate of from\r\n250 to 300 pounds per square foot of grate surface per hour may be\r\nobtained. With a blast of, say, five-tenths inch of water, this rate can\r\nbe increased to 450 pounds per square foot of grate surface per hour.\r\nThese rates apply to bagasse as fired containing approximately 50 per\r\ncent of moisture. It would appear that the most economical results are\r\nsecured with a combustion rate of approximately 300 pounds per square\r\nfoot per hour which, as stated, may be obtained with natural draft.\r\nWhere a natural draft is available sufficient to give such a rate, it is\r\nin general to be preferred to a blast.\r\n\r\nFig. 27 shows a typical bagasse furnace with which very satisfactory\r\nresults have been obtained. The design of this furnace may be altered to\r\nsuit the boilers to which it is connected. It may be changed slightly in\r\nits proportions and in certain instances in its position relative to the\r\nboiler. The furnace as shown is essentially a bagasse furnace and may be\r\nmodified somewhat to accommodate auxiliary fuel.\r\n\r\nThe fuel is ignited in a pit A on a hearth which is ordinarily\r\nelliptical in shape. Air for combustion is admitted through the tuyeres\r\nB connected to an annular space C through which the amount of air is\r\ncontrolled. Above the pit the furnace widens out to form a combustion\r\nspace D which has a cylindrical or spherical roof with its top\r\nordinarily from 11 to 13 feet above the floor. The gases pass from this\r\nspace horizontally to a second combustion chamber E from which they are\r\nled through arches F to the boiler. The arrangement of such arches is\r\nmodified to suit the boiler or boilers with which the furnace is\r\noperated. A furnace of such design embodies the essential features of\r\nample combustion space and long gas travel.\r\n\r\nThe fuel should be fed to the furnace through an opening in the roof\r\nabove the pit by some mechanical means which will insure a constant fuel\r\nfeed and at the same time prevent the inrush of cold air into the\r\nfurnace.\r\n\r\nThis class of fuel deposits a considerable quantity of dust, which if\r\nnot removed promptly will fuse into a hard glass-like clinker. Ample\r\nprovision should be made for the removal of such dust from the furnace,\r\nthe gas ducts and the boiler setting, and these should be thoroughly\r\ncleaned once in 24 hours.\r\n\r\nTable 45 gives the results of several tests on Babcock & Wilcox boilers\r\nusing fuel of this character.\r\n\r\n                               TABLE 45\r\n\r\n         TESTS OF BABCOCK & WILCOX BOILERS WITH GREEN BAGASSE\r\n ____________________________________________________________________\r\n| Duration of Test           |  Hours    |  12  |  10  |  10  |  10  |\r\n| Rated Capacity of Boiler   |Horse Power| 319  | 319  | 319  | 319  |\r\n| Grate Surface              |Square Feet|  33  |  33  | 16.5 | 16.5 |\r\n| Draft in Furnace           |  Inches   | .30  | .28  | .29  | .27  |\r\n| Draft at Damper            |  Inches   | .47  | .45  | .46  | .48  |\r\n| Blast under Grates         |  Inches   | ...  | ...  | ...  | .34  |\r\n| Temperature of Exit Gases  | Degrees F.|  536 |  541 |  522 |  547 |\r\n|                    /CO_{2} | Per Cent  | 13.8 | 12.6 | 11.7 | 12.8 |\r\n| Flue Gas Analysis { O      | Per Cent  |  5.9 |  7.6 |  8.2 |  6.9 |\r\n|                    \\CO     | Per Cent  |  0.0 |  0.0 |  0.0 |  0.0 |\r\n| Bagasse per Hour as Fired  |  Pounds   | 4980 | 4479 | 5040 | 5586 |\r\n| Moisture in Bagasse        | Per Cent  |52.39 |52.93 |51.84 |51.71 |\r\n| Dry Bagasse per Hour       |  Pounds   | 2371 | 2108 | 2427 | 2697 |\r\n| Dry Bagasse per Square Foot|           |      |      |      |      |\r\n|   of Grate Surface per Hour|  Pounds   | 71.9 | 63.9 |147.1 |163.4 |\r\n| Water per Hour from and at |           |      |      |      |      |\r\n|   212 Degrees              |  Pounds   |10141 | 9850 |10430 |11229 |\r\n| Per Cent of Rated Capacity |           |      |      |      |      |\r\n|   Developed                | Per Cent  | 92.1 | 89.2 | 94.7 |102.0 |\r\n|____________________________|___________|______|______|______|______|\r\n\r\nTan Bark--Tan bark, or spent tan, is the fibrous portion of bark\r\nremaining after use in the tanning industry. It is usually very high in\r\nits moisture content, a number of samples giving an average of 65 per\r\ncent or about two-thirds of the total weight of the fuel. The weight of\r\nthe spent tan is about 2.13 times as great as the weight of the bark\r\nground. In calorific value an average of 10 samples gives 9500 B. t. u.\r\nper pound dry.[43] The available heat per pound as fired, owing to the\r\ngreat percentage of moisture usually found, will be approximately 2700\r\nB. t. u. Since the weight of the spent tan as fired is 2.13 as great as\r\nthe weight of the bark as ground at the mill, one pound of ground bark\r\nproduces an available heat of approximately 5700 B. t. u. Relative to\r\nbituminous coal, a ton of bark is equivalent to 0.4 ton of coal. An\r\naverage chemical analysis of the bark is, carbon 51.8 per cent, hydrogen\r\n6.04, oxygen 40.74, ash 1.42.\r\n\r\nTan bark is burned in isolated cases and in general the remarks on\r\nburning wet wood fuel apply to its combustion. The essential features\r\nare a large combustion space, large areas of heated brickwork radiating\r\nto the fuel bed, and draft sufficient for high combustion rates. The\r\nratings obtainable with this class of fuel will not be as high as with\r\nwet wood fuel, because of the heat value and the excessive moisture\r\ncontent. Mr. D. M. Meyers found in a series of experiments that an\r\naverage of from 1.5 to 2.08 horse power could be developed per square\r\nfoot of grate surface with horizontal return tubular boilers. This horse\r\npower would vary considerably with the method in which the spent tan was\r\nfired.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 686 Horse-power Babcock & Wilcox Boiler and Superheater\r\nin Course of Erection at the Quincy, Mass., Station of the Bay State\r\nStreet Railway Co.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIQUID FUELS AND THEIR COMBUSTION\r\n\r\n\r\nPetroleum is practically the only liquid fuel sufficiently abundant and\r\ncheap to be used for the generation of steam. It possesses many\r\nadvantages over coal and is extensively used in many localities.\r\n\r\nThere are three kinds of petroleum in use, namely those yielding on\r\ndistillation: 1st, paraffin; 2nd, asphalt; 3rd, olefine. To the first\r\ngroup belong the oils of the Appalachian Range and the Middle West of\r\nthe United States. These are a dark brown in color with a greenish\r\ntinge. Upon their distillation such a variety of valuable light oils are\r\nobtained that their use as fuel is prohibitive because of price.\r\n\r\nTo the second group belong the oils found in Texas and California. These\r\nvary in color from a reddish brown to a jet black and are used very\r\nlargely as fuel.\r\n\r\nThe third group comprises the oils from Russia, which, like the second,\r\nare used largely for fuel purposes.\r\n\r\nThe light and easily ignited constituents of petroleum, such as naphtha,\r\ngasolene and kerosene, are oftentimes driven off by a partial\r\ndistillation, these products being of greater value for other purposes\r\nthan for use as fuel. This partial distillation does not decrease the\r\nvalue of petroleum as a fuel; in fact, the residuum known in trade as\r\n\"fuel oil\" has a slightly higher calorific value than petroleum and\r\nbecause of its higher flash point, it may be more safely handled.\r\nStatements made with reference to petroleum apply as well to fuel oil.\r\n\r\nIn general crude oil consists of carbon and hydrogen, though it also\r\ncontains varying quantities of moisture, sulphur, nitrogen, arsenic,\r\nphosphorus and silt. The moisture contained may vary from less than 1 to\r\nover 30 per cent, depending upon the care taken to separate the water\r\nfrom the oil in pumping from the well. As in any fuel, this moisture\r\naffects the available heat of the oil, and in contracting for the\r\npurchase of fuel of this nature it is well to limit the per cent of\r\nmoisture it may contain. A large portion of any contained moisture can\r\nbe separated by settling and for this reason sufficient storage capacity\r\nshould be supplied to provide time for such action.\r\n\r\nA method of obtaining approximately the percentage of moisture in crude\r\noil which may be used successfully, particularly with lighter oils, is\r\nas follows. A burette graduated into 200 divisions is filled to the 100\r\nmark with gasolene, and the remaining 100 divisions with the oil, which\r\nshould be slightly warmed before mixing. The two are then shaken\r\ntogether and any shrinkage below the 200 mark filled up with oil. The\r\nmixture should then be allowed to stand in a warm place for 24 hours,\r\nduring which the water and silt will settle to the bottom. Their\r\npercentage by volume can then be correctly read on the burette\r\ndivisions, and the percentage by weight calculated from the specific\r\ngravities. This method is exceedingly approximate and where accurate\r\nresults are required it should not be used. For such work, the\r\ndistillation method should be used as follows:\r\n\r\nGradually heat 100 cubic centimeters of the oil in a distillation flask\r\nto a temperature of 150 degrees centigrade; collect the distillate in a\r\ngraduated tube and measure the resulting water. Such a method insures\r\ncomplete removal of water and reduces the error arising from the slight\r\nsolubility of the water in gasolene.

While information on the actual flash points of the\r\nvarious oils is meager, it is, nevertheless, a question of importance in\r\ndetermining their availability as fuels. In general it may be stated\r\nthat the light oils have a low, and the heavy oils a much higher flash\r\npoint. A division is sometimes made at oils having a specific gravity of\r\n0.85, with a statement that where the specific gravity is below this\r\npoint the flash point is below 60 degrees Fahrenheit, and where it is\r\nabove, the flash point is above 60 degrees Fahrenheit. There are,\r\nhowever, many exceptions to this rule. As the flash point is lower the\r\ndanger of ignition or explosion becomes greater, and the utmost care\r\nshould be taken in handling the oils with a low flash point to avoid\r\nthis danger. On the other hand, because the flash point is high is no\r\njustification for carelessness in handling those fuels. With proper\r\nprecautions taken, in general, the use of oil as fuel is practically as\r\nsafe as the use of coal.\r\n\r\nGravity of Oils--Oils are frequently classified according to their\r\ngravity as indicated by the Beaume hydrometer scale. Such a\r\nclassification is by no means an accurate measure of their relative\r\ncalorific values.\r\n\r\nPetroleum as Compared with Coal--The advantages of the use of oil fuel\r\nover coal may be summarized as follows:\r\n\r\n1st. The cost of handling is much lower, the oil being fed by simple\r\nmechanical means, resulting in,\r\n\r\n2nd. A general labor saving throughout the plant in the elimination of\r\nstokers, coal passers, ash handlers, etc.\r\n\r\n3rd. For equal heat value, oil occupies very much less space than coal.\r\nThis storage space may be at a distance from the boiler without\r\ndetriment.\r\n\r\n4th. Higher efficiencies and capacities are obtainable with oil than\r\nwith coal. The combustion is more perfect as the excess air is reduced\r\nto a minimum; the furnace temperature may be kept practically constant\r\nas the furnace doors need not be opened for cleaning or working fires;\r\nsmoke may be eliminated with the consequent increased cleanliness of the\r\nheating surfaces.\r\n\r\n5th. The intensity of the fire can be almost instantaneously regulated\r\nto meet load fluctuations.\r\n\r\n6th. Oil when stored does not lose in calorific value as does coal, nor\r\nare there any difficulties arising from disintegration, such as may be\r\nfound when coal is stored.\r\n\r\n7th. Cleanliness and freedom from dust and ashes in the boiler room with\r\na consequent saving in wear and tear on machinery; little or no damage\r\nto surrounding property due to such dust.\r\n\r\nThe disadvantages of oil are:\r\n\r\n1st. The necessity that the oil have a reasonably high flash point to\r\nminimize the danger of explosions.\r\n\r\n2nd. City or town ordinances may impose burdensome conditions relative\r\nto location and isolation of storage tanks, which in the case of a plant\r\nsituated in a congested portion of the city, might make use of this fuel\r\nprohibitive.\r\n\r\n3rd. Unless the boilers and furnaces are especially adapted for the use\r\nof this fuel, the boiler upkeep cost will be higher than if coal were\r\nused. This objection can be entirely obviated, however, if the\r\ninstallation is entrusted to those who have had experience in the work,\r\nand the operation of a properly designed plant is placed in the hands of\r\nintelligent labor.\r\n\r\n                                TABLE 47\r\n\r\n                   RELATIVE VALUE OF COAL AND OIL FUEL\r\n\r\n+------+--------+-------+-----------------------------------------------+\r\n|Gross |  Net   |  Net  |         Water Evaporated from and at          |\r\n|Boiler| Boiler |Evap-  |   212 Degrees Fahrenheit per Pound of Coal    |\r\n|Effic-|Effici- |oration+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+\r\n| iency|ency[46]| from  |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |\r\n| with |  with  |and at |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |\r\n| Oil  |  Oil   |  212  |  5  |  6  |  7  |  8  |  9  | 10  | 11  | 12  |\r\n| Fuel |  Fuel  |Degrees|     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |\r\n|      |        |Fahren-|     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |\r\n|      |        |  heit +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+\r\n|      |        |  per  |                                               |\r\n|      |        | Pound |   Pounds of Oil Equal to One Pound of Coal    |\r\n|      |        |of Oil |                                               |\r\n+------+--------+-------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+\r\n|  73  |   71   | 13.54 |.3693|.4431|.5170|.5909|.6647|.7386|.8124|.8863|\r\n|  74  |   72   | 13.73 |.3642|.4370|.5099|.5827|.6556|.7283|.8011|.8740|\r\n|  75  |   73   | 13.92 |.3592|.4310|.5029|.5747|.6466|.7184|.7903|.8621|\r\n|  76  |   74   | 14.11 |.3544|.4253|.4961|.5670|.6378|.7087|.7796|.8505|\r\n|  77  |   75   | 14.30 |.3497|.4196|.4895|.5594|.6294|.6993|.7692|.8392|\r\n|  78  |   76   | 14.49 |.3451|.4141|.4831|.5521|.6211|.6901|.7591|.8281|\r\n|  79  |   77   | 14.68 |.3406|.4087|.4768|.5450|.6131|.6812|.7493|.8174|\r\n|  80  |   78   | 14.87 |.3363|.4035|.4708|.5380|.6053|.6725|.7398|.8070|\r\n|  81  |   79   | 15.06 |.3320|.3984|.4648|.5312|.5976|.6640|.7304|.7968|\r\n|  82  |   80   | 15.25 |.3279|.3934|.4590|.5246|.5902|.6557|.7213|.7869|\r\n|  83  |   81   | 15.44 |.3238|.3886|.4534|.5181|.5829|.6447|.7125|.7772|\r\n+------+--------+-------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+\r\n|      |        |  Net  |                                               |\r\n|      |        |Evap-  |                                               |\r\n|      |        |oration|                                               |\r\n|      |        | from  |                                               |\r\n|      |        |and at |                                               |\r\n|      |        |  212  |    Barrels of Oil Equal to One Ton of Coal    |\r\n|      |        |Degrees|                                               |\r\n|      |        |Fahren-|                                               |\r\n|      |        |  heit |                                               |\r\n|      |        |  per  |                                               |\r\n|      |        |Barrel |                                               |\r\n|      |        |of Oil |                                               |\r\n+------+--------+-------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+\r\n|  73  |   71   | 4549  |2.198|2.638|3.077|3.516|3.955|4.395|4.835|5.275|\r\n|  74  |   72   | 4613  |2.168|2.601|3.035|3.468|3.902|4.335|4.769|5.202|\r\n|  75  |   73   | 4677  |2.138|2.565|2.993|3.420|3.848|4.275|4.703|5.131|\r\n|  76  |   74   | 4741  |2.110|2.532|2.954|3.376|3.798|4.220|4.642|5.063|\r\n|  77  |   75   | 4807  |2.082|2.498|2.914|3.330|3.746|4.162|4.578|4.994|\r\n|  78  |   76   | 4869  |2.054|2.465|2.876|3.286|3.697|4.108|4.518|4.929|\r\n|  79  |   77   | 4932  |2.027|2.433|2.838|3.243|3.649|4.054|4.460|4.865|\r\n|  80  |   78   | 4996  |2.002|2.402|2.802|3.202|3.602|4.003|4.403|4.803|\r\n|  81  |   79   | 5060  |1.976|2.371|2.767|3.162|3.557|3.952|4.348|4.743|\r\n|  82  |   80   | 5124  |1.952|2.342|2.732|3.122|3.513|3.903|4.293|4.683|\r\n|  83  |   81   | 5187  |1.927|2.313|2.699|3.085|3.470|3.856|4.241|4.627|\r\n+------+--------+-------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+\r\n\r\n[Illustration: City of San Francisco, Cal., Fire Fighting Station.

Table 47\r\ntakes into consideration the variation in efficiency with the two fuels,\r\nbut is based on a constant calorific value for oil and coal. This table,\r\nlike others of a similar nature, while useful as a rough guide, cannot\r\nbe considered as an accurate basis for comparison. This is due to the\r\nfact that there are numerous factors entering into the problem which\r\naffect the saving possible to a much greater extent than do the relative\r\ncalorific values of two fuels. Some of the features to be considered in\r\narriving at the true basis for comparison are the labor saving possible,\r\nthe space available for fuel storage, the facilities for conveying the\r\noil by pipe lines, the hours during which a plant is in operation, the\r\nload factor, the quantity of coal required for banking fires, etc., etc.\r\nThe only exact method of estimating the relative advantages and costs of\r\nthe two fuels is by considering the operating expenses of the plant with\r\neach in turn, including the costs of every item entering into the\r\nproblem.\r\n\r\nBurning Oil Fuel--The requirements for burning petroleum are as follows:\r\n\r\n1st. Its atomization must be thorough.\r\n\r\n2nd. When atomized it must be brought into contact with the requisite\r\nquantity of air for its combustion, and this quantity must be at the\r\nsame time a minimum to obviate loss in stack gases.\r\n\r\n3rd. The mixture must be burned in a furnace where a refractory material\r\nradiates heat to assist in the combustion, and the furnace must stand up\r\nunder the high temperatures developed.\r\n\r\n4th. The combustion must be completed before the gases come into contact\r\nwith the heating surfaces or otherwise the flame will be extinguished,\r\npossibly to ignite later in the flue connection or in the stack.\r\n\r\n5th. There must be no localization of the heat on certain portions of\r\nthe heating surfaces or trouble will result from overheating and\r\nblistering.\r\n\r\nThe first requirement is met by the selection of a proper burner.\r\n\r\nThe second requirement is fulfilled by properly introducing the air into\r\nthe furnace, either through checkerwork under the burners or through\r\nopenings around them, and by controlling the quantity of air to meet\r\nvariations in furnace conditions.\r\n\r\nThe third requirement is provided for by installing a furnace so\r\ndesigned as to give a sufficient area of heated brickwork to radiate the\r\nheat required to maintain a proper furnace temperature.\r\n\r\nThe fourth requirement is provided for by giving ample space for the\r\ncombustion of the mixture of atomized oil and air, and a gas travel of\r\nsufficient length to insure that this combustion be completed before the\r\ngases strike the heating surfaces.\r\n\r\nThe fifth requirement is fulfilled by the adoption of a suitable burner\r\nin connection with the furnace meeting the other requirements. A burner\r\nmust be used from which the flame will not impinge directly on the\r\nheating surface and must be located where such action cannot take place.\r\nIf suitable burners properly located are not used, not only is the heat\r\nlocalized with disastrous results, but the efficiency is lowered by the\r\ncooling of the gases before combustion is completed.\r\n\r\nOil Burners--The functions of an oil burner is to atomize or vaporize\r\nthe fuel so that it may be burned like a gas. All burners may be\r\nclassified under three general types: 1st, spray burners, in which the\r\noil is atomized by steam or compressed air; 2nd, vapor burners, in which\r\nthe oil is converted into vapor and then passed into the furnace; 3rd,\r\nmechanical burners, in which the oil is atomized by submitting it to a\r\nhigh pressure and passing it through a small orifice.\r\n\r\nVapor burners have never been in general use and will not be discussed.\r\n\r\nSpray burners are almost universally used for land practice and the\r\nsimplicity of the steam atomizer and the excellent economy of the better\r\ntypes, together with the low oil pressure and temperature required makes\r\nthis type a favorite for stationary plants, where the loss of fresh\r\nwater is not a vital consideration. In marine work, or in any case where\r\nit is advisable to save feed water that otherwise would have to be added\r\nin the form of \"make-up\", either compressed air or mechanical means are\r\nused for atomization. Spray burners using compressed air as the\r\natomizing agent are in satisfactory operation in some plants, but their\r\nuse is not general. Where there is no necessity of saving raw feed\r\nwater, the greater simplicity and economy of the steam spray atomizer is\r\ngenerally the most satisfactory. The air burners require blowers,\r\ncompressors or other apparatus which occupy space that might be\r\notherwise utilized and require attention that is not necessary where\r\nsteam is used.\r\n\r\nSteam spray burners of the older types had disadvantages in that they\r\nwere so designed that there was a tendency for the nozzle to clog with\r\nsludge or coke formed from the oil by the heat, without means of being\r\nreadily cleaned. This has been overcome in the more modern types.\r\n\r\nSteam spray burners, as now used, may be divided into two classes: 1st,\r\ninside mixers; and 2nd, outside mixers. In the former the steam and oil\r\ncome into contact within the burner and the mixture is atomized in\r\npassing through the orifice of the burner nozzle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 28. Peabody Oil Burner]\r\n\r\nIn the outside mixing class the steam flows through a narrow slot or\r\nhorizontal row of small holes in the burner nozzle; the oil flows\r\nthrough a similar slot or hole above the steam orifice, and is picked up\r\nby the steam outside of the burner and is atomized. Fig. 28 shows a type\r\nof the Peabody burner of this class, which has given eminent\r\nsatisfaction. The construction is evident from the cut. It will be noted\r\nthat the portions of the burner forming the orifice may be readily\r\nreplaced in case of wear, or if it is desired to alter the form of the\r\nflame.\r\n\r\nWhere burners of the spray type are used, heating the oil is of\r\nadvantage not only in causing it to be atomized more easily, but in\r\naiding economical combustion. The temperature is, of course, limited by\r\nthe flash point of the oil used, but within the limit of this\r\ntemperature there is no danger of decomposition or of carbon deposits on\r\nthe supply pipes. Such heating should be done close to the boiler to\r\nminimize radiation loss. If the temperature is raised to a point where\r\nan appreciable vaporization occurs, the oil will flow irregularly from\r\nthe burner and cause the flame to sputter.\r\n\r\nOn both steam and air atomizing types, a by-pass should be installed\r\nbetween the steam or air and the oil pipes to provide for the blowing\r\nout of the oil duct. Strainers should be provided for removing sludge\r\nfrom the fuel and should be so located as to allow for rapid removal,\r\ncleaning and replacing.\r\n\r\nMechanical burners have been in use for some time in European countries,\r\nbut their introduction and use has been of only recent occurrence in the\r\nUnited States. Here as already stated, the means for atomization are\r\npurely mechanical. The most successful of the mechanical atomizers up to\r\nthe present have been of the round flame type, and only these will be\r\nconsidered. Experiments have been made with flat flame mechanical\r\nburners, but their satisfactory action has been confined to instances\r\nwhere it is only necessary to burn a small quantity of oil through each\r\nindividual burner.\r\n\r\nThis system of oil burning is especially adapted for marine work as the\r\nquantity of steam for putting pressure on the oil is small and the\r\ncondensed steam may be returned to the system.\r\n\r\nThe only method by which successful mechanical atomization has been\r\naccomplished is one by which the oil is given a whirling motion within\r\nthe burner tip. This is done either by forcing the oil through a passage\r\nof helical form or by delivering it tangentially to a circular chamber\r\nfrom which there is a central outlet. The oil is fed to these burners\r\nunder a pressure which varies with the make of the burner and the rates\r\nat which individual burners are using oil. The oil particles fly off\r\nfrom such a burner in straight lines in the form of a cone rather than\r\nin the form of a spiral spray, as might be supposed.\r\n\r\nWith burners of the mechanical atomizing design, the method of\r\nintroducing air for combustion and the velocity of this air are of the\r\ngreatest importance in securing good combustion and in the effects on\r\nthe character and shape of the flame. Such burners are located at the\r\nfront of the furnace and various methods have been tried for introducing\r\nthe air for combustion. Where, in the spray burners, air is ordinarily\r\nadmitted through a checkerwork under the burner proper, with the\r\nmechanical burner, it is almost universally admitted around the burner.\r\nEarly experiments with these air distributors were confined largely to\r\nsingle or duplicate cones used with the idea of directing the air to the\r\naxis of the burner. A highly successful method of such air introduction,\r\ndeveloped by Messrs. Peabody and Irish of The Babcock & Wilcox Co., is\r\nby means of what they term an \"impeller plate\". This consists of a\r\ncircular metal disk with an opening at the center for the oil burner and\r\nwith radial metal strips from the center to the periphery turned at an\r\nangle which in the later designs may be altered to give the air supply\r\ndemanded by the rate of combustion.\r\n\r\nThe air so admitted does not necessarily require a whirling motion, but\r\nexperiments show that where the air is brought into contact with the oil\r\nspray with the right \"twist\", better combustion is secured and lower air\r\npressures and less refinement of adjustment of individual burners are\r\nrequired.\r\n\r\nMechanical burners have a distinct advantage over those in which steam\r\nis used as the atomizing agent in that they lend themselves more readily\r\nto adjustment under wider variations of load. For a given horse power\r\nthere will ordinarily be installed a much greater number of mechanical\r\nthan steam atomizing burners. This in itself is a means to better\r\nregulation, for with the steam atomizing burner, if one of a number is\r\nshut off, there is a marked decrease in efficiency. This is due to the\r\nfact that with the air admitted under the burner, it is ordinarily\r\npassing through the checkerwork regardless of whether it is being\r\nutilized for combustion or not. With a mechanical burner, on the other\r\nhand, where individual burners are shut off, air that would be admitted\r\nfor such burner, were it in operation, may also be shut off and there\r\nwill be no undue loss from excess air.\r\n\r\nFurther adjustment to meet load conditions is possible by a change in\r\nthe oil pressure acting on all burners at once. A good burner will\r\natomize moderately heavy oil with an oil pressure as low as 30 pounds\r\nper square inch and from that point up to 200 pounds or above. The\r\nheating of the oil also has an effect on the capacity of individual\r\nburners and in this way a third method of adjustment is given. Under\r\nworking conditions, the oil pressure remaining constant, the capacity of\r\neach burner will decrease as the temperature of the oil is increased\r\nthough at low temperatures the reverse is the case. Some experiments\r\nwith a Texas crude oil having a flash point of 210 degrees showed that\r\nthe capacity of a mechanical atomizing burner of the Peabody type\r\nincreased from 80 degrees Fahrenheit to 110 degrees Fahrenheit, from\r\nwhich point it fell off rapidly to 140 degrees and then more slowly to\r\nthe flash point.\r\n\r\nThe above methods, together with the regulation possible through\r\nmanipulation of the boiler dampers, indicate the wide range of load\r\nconditions that may be handled with an installation of this class of\r\nburners.\r\n\r\nAs has already been stated, results with mechanical atomizing burners\r\nthat may be considered very successful have been limited almost entirely\r\nto cases where forced blast of some description has been used, the high\r\nvelocity of the air entering being of material assistance in securing\r\nthe proper mixture of air with the oil spray. Much has been done and is\r\nbeing done in the way of experiment with this class of apparatus toward\r\ndeveloping a successful mechanical atomizing burner for use with natural\r\ndraft, and there appears to be no reason why such experiments should not\r\neventually produce satisfactory results.\r\n\r\nSteam Consumption of Burners--The Bureau of Steam Engineering, U. S.\r\nNavy, made in 1901 an exhaustive series of tests of various oil burners\r\nthat may be considered as representing, in so far as the performance of\r\nthe burners themselves is concerned, the practice of that time. These\r\ntests showed that a burner utilizing air as an atomizing agent, required\r\nfor compressing the air from 1.06 to 7.45 per cent of the total steam\r\ngenerated, the average being 3.18 per cent. Four tests of steam\r\natomizing burners showed a consumption of 3.98 to 5.77 per cent of the\r\ntotal steam, the average being 4.8 per cent.\r\n\r\nImprovement in burner design has largely reduced the steam consumption,\r\nthough to a greater degree in steam than in air atomizing burners.\r\nRecent experiments show that a good steam atomizing burner will require\r\napproximately 2 per cent of the total steam generated by the boiler\r\noperated at or about its rated capacity. This figure will decrease as\r\nthe capacity is increased and is so low as to be practically negligible,\r\nexcept in cases where the question of loss of feed water is all\r\nimportant. There are no figures available as to the actual steam\r\nconsumption of mechanical atomizing burners but apparently this is small\r\nif the requirement is understood to be entirely apart from the steam\r\nconsumption of the apparatus producing the forced blast.\r\n\r\nCapacity of Burners--A good steam atomizing burner properly located in a\r\nwell-designed oil furnace has a capacity of somewhat over 400 horse\r\npower. This question of capacity of individual burners is largely one of\r\nthe proper relation between the number of burners used and the furnace\r\nvolume. In some recent tests with a Babcock & Wilcox boiler of 640 rated\r\nhorse power, equipped with three burners, approximately 1350 horse power\r\nwas developed with an available draft of .55 inch at the damper or 450\r\nhorse power per burner. Four burners were also tried in the same furnace\r\nbut the total steam generated did not exceed 1350 horse power or in this\r\ninstance 338 horse power per burner.\r\n\r\nFrom the nature of mechanical atomizing burners, individual burners have\r\nnot as large a capacity as the steam atomizing class. In some tests on a\r\nBabcock & Wilcox marine boiler, equipped with mechanical atomizing\r\nburners, the maximum horse power developed per burner was approximately\r\n105. Here again the burner capacity is largely one of proper relation\r\nbetween furnace volume and number of burners.\r\n\r\nFurnace Design--Too much stress cannot be laid on the importance of\r\nfurnace design for the use of this class of fuel. Provided a good type\r\nof burner is adopted the furnace arrangement and the method of\r\nintroducing air for combustion into the furnace are the all important\r\nfactors. No matter what the type of burner, satisfactory results cannot\r\nbe secured in a furnace not suited to the fuel.\r\n\r\nThe Babcock & Wilcox Co. has had much experience with the burning of oil\r\nas fuel and an extended series of experiments by Mr. E. H. Peabody led\r\nto the development and adoption of the Peabody furnace as being most\r\neminently suited for this class of work. Fig. 29 shows such a furnace\r\napplied to a Babcock & Wilcox boiler, and with slight modification it\r\ncan be as readily applied to any boiler of The Babcock & Wilcox Co.\r\nmanufacture. In the description of this furnace, its points of advantage\r\ncover the requirements of oil-burning furnaces in general.\r\n\r\nThe atomized oil is introduced into the furnace in the direction in\r\nwhich it increases in height. This increase in furnace volume in the\r\ndirection of the flame insures free expansion and a thorough mixture of\r\nthe oil with the air, and the consequent complete combustion of the\r\ngases before they come into contact with the tube heating surfaces. In\r\nsuch a furnace flat flame burners should be used, preferably of the\r\nPeabody type, in which the flame spreads outward toward the sides in the\r\nform of a fan. There is no tendency of the flames to impinge directly on\r\nthe heating surfaces, and the furnace can handle any quantity of flame\r\nwithout danger of tube difficulties. The burners should be so located\r\nthat the flames from individual burners do not interfere nor impinge to\r\nany extent on the side walls of the furnace, an even distribution of\r\nheat being secured in this manner. The burners are operated from the\r\nboiler front and peepholes are supplied through which the operator may\r\nwatch the flame while regulating the burners. The burners can be\r\nremoved, inspected, or cleaned and replaced in a few minutes. Air is\r\nadmitted through a checkerwork of fire brick supported on the furnace\r\nfloor, the openings in the checkerwork being so arranged as to give the\r\nbest economic results in combustion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 29. Babcock & Wilcox Boiler, Equipped with a Peabody\r\nOil Furnace]\r\n\r\nWith steam atomizing burners introduced through the front of the boiler\r\nin stationary practice, it is usually in the direction in which the\r\nfurnace decreases in height and it is with such an arrangement that\r\ndifficulties through the loss of tubes may be expected. With such an\r\narrangement, the flame may impinge directly upon the tube surfaces and\r\ntube troubles from this source may arise, particularly where the feed\r\nwater has a tendency toward rapid scale formation. Such difficulties may\r\nbe the result of a blowpipe action on the part of the burner, the over\r\nheating of the tube due to oil or scale within, or the actual erosion of\r\nthe metal by particles of oil improperly atomized. Such action need not\r\nbe anticipated, provided the oil is burned with a short flame. The\r\nflames from mechanical atomizing burners have a less velocity of\r\nprojection than those from steam atomizing burners and if introduced\r\ninto the higher end of the furnace, should not lead to tube difficulties\r\nprovided they are properly located and operated. This class of burner\r\nalso will give the most satisfactory results if introduced so that the\r\nflames travel in the direction of increase in furnace volume. This is\r\nperhaps best exemplified by the very good results secured with\r\nmechanical atomizing burners and Babcock & Wilcox marine boilers in\r\nwhich, due to the fact that the boilers are fired from the low end, the\r\nflames from burners introduced through the front are in this direction.\r\n\r\nOperation of Burners--When burners are not in use, or when they are\r\nbeing started up, care must be taken to prevent oil from flowing and\r\ncollecting on the floor of the furnace before it is ignited. In starting\r\na burner, the atomized fuel may be ignited by a burning wad of oil-soaked\r\nwaste held before it on an iron rod. To insure quick ignition, the steam\r\nsupply should be cut down. But little practice is required to become an\r\nadept at lighting an oil fire. When ignition has taken place and the\r\nfurnace brought to an even heat, the steam should be cut down to the\r\nminimum amount required for atomization. This amount can be determined\r\nfrom the appearance of the flame. If sufficient steam is not supplied,\r\nparticles of burning oil will drop to the furnace floor, giving a\r\nscintillating appearance to the flame. The steam valves should be opened\r\njust sufficiently to overcome this scintillating action.\r\n\r\nAir Supply--From the nature of the fuel and the method of burning, the\r\nquantity of air for combustion may be minimized. As with other fuels,\r\nwhen the amount of air admitted is the minimum which will completely\r\nconsume the oil, the results are the best. The excess or deficiency of\r\nair can be judged by the appearance of the stack or by observing the\r\ngases passing through the boiler settings. A perfectly clear stack\r\nindicates excess air, whereas smoke indicates a deficiency. With\r\nproperly designed furnaces the best results are secured by running near\r\nthe smoking point with a slight haze in the gases. A slight variation in\r\nthe air supply will affect the furnace conditions in an oil burning\r\nboiler more than the same variation where coal is used, and for this\r\nreason it is of the utmost importance that flue gas analysis be made\r\nfrequently on oil-burning boilers. With the air for combustion properly\r\nregulated by adjustment of any checkerwork or any other device which may\r\nbe used, and the dampers carefully set, the flue gas analysis should\r\nshow, for good furnace conditions, a percentage of CO_{2} between 13 and\r\n14 per cent, with either no CO or but a trace.\r\n\r\nIn boiler plant operation it is difficult to regulate the steam supply\r\nto the burners and the damper position to meet sudden and repeated\r\nvariations in the load. A device has been patented which automatically\r\nregulates by means of the boiler pressure the pressure of the steam to\r\nthe burners, the oil to the burners and the position of the boiler\r\ndamper. Such a device has been shown to give good results in plant\r\noperation where hand regulation is difficult at best, and in many\r\ninstances is unfortunately not even attempted.\r\n\r\nEfficiency with Oil--As pointed out in enumerating the advantages of oil\r\nfuel over coal, higher efficiencies are obtainable with the former. With\r\nboilers of approximately 500 horse power equipped with properly designed\r\nfurnaces and burners, an efficiency of 83 per cent is possible or making\r\nan allowance of 2 per cent for steam used by burners, a net efficiency\r\nof 81 per cent. The conditions under which such efficiencies are to be\r\nsecured are distinctly test conditions in which careful operation is a\r\nprime requisite. With furnace conditions that are not conductive to the\r\nbest combustion, this figure may be decreased by from 5 to 10 per cent.\r\nIn large properly designed plants, however, the first named efficiency\r\nmay be approached for uniform running conditions, the nearness to which\r\nit is reached depending on the intelligence of the operating crew. It\r\nmust be remembered that the use of oil fuel presents to the careless\r\noperator possibilities for wastefulness much greater than in plants\r\nwhere coal is fired, and it therefore pays to go carefully into this\r\nfeature.\r\n\r\nTable 48 gives some representative tests with oil fuel.\r\n\r\n                                 TABLE 48\r\n\r\n            TESTS OF BABCOCK AND WILCOX BOILERS

burning of oil in connection with other\r\nfuels, and a combination of this sort may be advisable either with the\r\nview to increasing the boiler capacity to assist over peak loads, or to\r\nkeep the boiler in operation where there is the possibility of a\r\ntemporary failure of the primary fuel. It would appear from experiments\r\nthat such a combination gives satisfactory results from the standpoint\r\nof both capacity and efficiency, if the two fuels are burned in separate\r\nfurnaces. Satisfactory results cannot ordinarily be obtained when it is\r\nattempted to burn oil fuel in the same furnace as the primary fuel, as\r\nit is practically impossible to admit the proper amount of air for\r\ncombustion for each of the two fuels simultaneously. The Babcock &\r\nWilcox boiler lends itself readily to a double furnace arrangement and\r\nFig. 30 shows an installation where oil fuel is burned as an auxiliary\r\nto wood.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 30. Babcock & Wilcox Boiler Set with Combination Oil\r\nand Wood-burning Furnace]\r\n\r\nWater-gas Tar--Water-gas tar, or gas-house tar, is a by-product of the\r\ncoal used in the manufacture of water gas. It is slightly heavier than\r\ncrude oil and has a comparatively low flash point. In burning, it should\r\nbe heated only to a temperature which makes it sufficiently fluid, and\r\nany furnace suitable for crude oil is in general suitable for water-gas\r\ntar. Care should be taken where this fuel is used to install a suitable\r\napparatus for straining it before it is fed to the burner.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Babcock & Wilcox Boilers Fired with Blast Furnace Gas at\r\nthe Bethlehem Steel Co., Bethlehem, Pa. This Company Operates 12,900\r\nHorse Power of Babcock & Wilcox Boilers]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGASEOUS FUELS AND THEIR COMBUSTION\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the gaseous fuels available for steam generating purposes, the most\r\ncommon are blast furnace gas, natural gas and by-product coke oven gas.\r\n\r\nBlast furnace gas, as implied by its name, is a by-product from the\r\nblast furnace of the iron industry. This gasification of the solid fuel\r\nin a blast furnace results, 1st, through combustion by the oxygen of the\r\nblast; 2nd, through contact with the incandescent ore (Fe_{2}O_{3} + C\r\n= 2 FeO + CO and FeO + C = Fe + CO); and 3rd, through the agency of\r\nCO_{2} either formed in the process of reduction or driven from the\r\ncarbonates charged either as ore or flux.\r\n\r\nApproximately 90 per cent of the fuel consumed in all of the blast\r\nfurnaces of the United States is coke. The consumption of coke per ton\r\nof iron made varies from 1600 to 3600 pounds per ton of 2240 pounds of\r\niron. This consumption depends upon the quality of the coal, the nature\r\nof the ore, the quality of the pig iron produced and the equipment and\r\nmanagement of the plant. The average consumption, and one which is\r\napproximately correct for ordinary conditions, is 2000 pounds of coke\r\nper gross ton (2240 pounds) of pig iron. The gas produced in a gas\r\nfurnace per ton of pig iron is obtained from the weight of fixed carbon\r\ngasified, the weight of the oxygen combined with the material of charge\r\nreduced, the weight of the gaseous constituents of the flux and the\r\nweight of air delivered by the blowing engine and the weight of volatile\r\ncombustible contained in the coke. Ordinarily, this weight of gas will\r\nbe found to be approximately five times the weight of the coke burned,\r\nor 10,000 pounds per ton of pig iron produced.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of the small amount of carbon in combination with\r\nhydrogen as methane, and a very small percentage of free hydrogen,\r\nordinarily less than 0.1 per cent, the calorific value of blast furnace\r\ngas is due to the CO content which when united with sufficient oxygen\r\nwhen burned under a boiler, burns further to CO_{2}. The heat value of\r\nsuch gas will vary in most cases from 85 to 100 B. t. u. per cubic foot\r\nunder standard conditions. In modern practice, where the blast is heated\r\nby hot blast stoves, approximately 15 per cent of the total amount of\r\ngas is used for this purpose, leaving 85 per cent of the total for use\r\nunder boilers or in gas engines, that is, approximately 8500 pounds of\r\ngas per ton of pig iron produced. In a modern blast furnace plant, the\r\ngas serves ordinarily as the only fuel required. Table 49 gives the\r\nanalyses of several samples of blast furnace gas.\r\n\r\n                             TABLE 49\r\n\r\n               TYPICAL ANALYSES OF BLAST FURNACE GAS\r\n\r\n+----------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n|+-----------------------+------+----+-----+----+------+--------+|\r\n||                       |CO_{2}| O  | CO  | H  |CH_{4}|   N    ||\r\n|+-----------------------+------+----+-----+----+------+--------+|\r\n||Bessemer Furnace       |  9.85|0.36|32.73|3.14|  ..  |53.92   ||\r\n||Bessemer Furnace       | 11.4 | .. |27.7 |1.9 | 0.3  |58.7    ||\r\n||Bessemer Furnace       | 10.0 | .. |26.2 |3.1 | 0.2  |60.5    ||\r\n||Bessemer Furnace       |  9.1 | .. |28.7 |2.7 | 0.2  |59.3    ||\r\n||Bessemer Furnace       | 13.5 | .. |25.2 |1.43|  ..  |59.87   ||\r\n||Bessemer Furnace[47]   | 10.9 | .. |27.8 |2.8 | 0.2  |58.3    ||\r\n||Ferro Manganese Furnace|  7.1 | .. |30.1 | .. |  ..  |62.8[48]||\r\n||Basic Ore Furnace      | 16.0 |0.2 |23.6 | .. |  ..  |60.2[48]||\r\n|+-----------------------+------+----+-----+----+------+--------+|\r\n+----------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n\r\nUntil recently, the important consideration in the burning of blast\r\nfurnace gas has been the capacity that can be developed with practically\r\nno attention given to the aspect of efficiency. This phase of the\r\nquestion is now drawing attention and furnaces especially designed for\r\ngood efficiency with this class of fuel are demanded. The essential\r\nfeature is ample combustion space, in which the combustion of gases may\r\nbe practically completed before striking the heating surfaces. The gases\r\nhave the power of burning out completely after striking the heating\r\nsurfaces, provided the initial temperature is sufficiently high, but\r\nwhere the combustion is completed before such time, the results secured\r\nare more satisfactory. A furnace volume of approximately 1 to 1.5 cubic\r\nfeet per rated boiler horse power will give a combustion space that is\r\nample.\r\n\r\nWhere there is the possibility of a failure of the gas supply, or where\r\nsteam is required when the blast furnace is shut down, coal fired grates\r\nof sufficient size to get the required capacity should be installed.\r\nWhere grates of full size are not required, ignition grates should be\r\ninstalled, which need be only large enough to carry a fire for igniting\r\nthe gas or for generating a small quantity of steam when the blast\r\nfurnace is shut down. The area of such grates has no direct bearing on\r\nthe size of the boiler. The grates may be placed directly under the gas\r\nburners in a standard position or may be placed between two bridge walls\r\nback of the gas furnace and fired from the side of the boiler. An\r\nadvantage is claimed for the standard grate position that it minimizes\r\nthe danger of explosion on the re-ignition of gas after a temporary\r\nstoppage of the supply and also that a considerable amount of dirt, of\r\nwhich there is a good deal with this class of fuel and which is\r\ndifficult to remove, deposits on the fire and is taken out when the\r\nfires are cleaned. In any event, regardless of the location of the\r\ngrates, ample provision should be made for removing this dust, not only\r\nfrom the furnace but from the setting as a whole.\r\n\r\nBlast furnace gas burners are of two general types: Those in which the\r\nair for combustion is admitted around the burner proper, and those in\r\nwhich this air is admitted through the burner. Whatever the design of\r\nburner, provision should be made for the regulation of both the air and\r\nthe gas supply independently. A gas opening of .8 square inch per rated\r\nhorse power will enable a boiler to develop its nominal rating with a\r\ngas pressure in the main of about 2 inches. This pressure is ordinarily\r\nfrom 6 to 8 inches and in this way openings of the above size will be\r\ngood for ordinary overloads. The air openings should be from .75 to .85\r\nsquare inch per rated horse power. Good results are secured by inclining\r\nthe gas burners slightly downward toward the rear of the furnace. Where\r\nthe burners are introduced over coal fired grates, they should be set\r\nhigh enough to give headroom for hand firing.\r\n\r\nOrdinarily, individual stacks of 130 feet high with diameters as given\r\nin Kent's table for corresponding horse power are large enough for this\r\nclass of work. Such a stack will give a draft sufficient to allow a\r\nboiler to be operated at 175 per cent of its rated capacity, and beyond\r\nthis point the capacity will not increase proportionately with the\r\ndraft. When more than one boiler is connected with a stack, the draft\r\navailable at the damper should be equivalent to that which an individual\r\nstack of 130 feet high would give. The draft from such a stack is\r\nnecessary to maintain a suction under all conditions throughout all\r\nparts of the setting. If the draft is increased above that which such a\r\nstack will give, difficulties arise from excess air for combustion with\r\nconsequent loss in efficiency.\r\n\r\nA poor mixing or laneing action in the furnace may result in a pulsating\r\neffect of the gases in the setting. This action may at times be remedied\r\nby admitting more air to the furnace. On account of the possibility of a\r\npulsating action of the gases under certain conditions and the puffs or\r\nexplosions, settings for this class of work should be carefully\r\nconstructed and thoroughly buckstayed and tied.\r\n\r\nNatural Gas--Natural gas from different localities varies considerably\r\nin composition and heating value. In Table 50 there is given a number of\r\nanalyses and heat values for natural gas from various localities.\r\n\r\nThis fuel is used for steam generating purposes to a considerable extent\r\nin some localities, though such use is apparently decreasing. It is best\r\nburned by employing a large number of small burners, each being capable\r\nof handling 30 nominal rated horse power. The use of a large number of\r\nburners obviates the danger of any laneing or blowpipe action, which\r\nmight be present where large burners are used. Ordinarily, such a gas,\r\nas it enters the burners, is under a pressure of about 8 ounces. For the\r\npurpose of comparison, all observations should be based on gas reduced\r\nto the standard conditions of temperature and pressure, namely 32\r\ndegrees Fahrenheit and 14.7 pounds per square inch. When the temperature\r\nand pressure corresponding to meter readings are known, the volume of\r\ngas under standard conditions may be obtained by multiplying the meter\r\nreadings in cubic feet by 33.54 P/T, in which P equals the absolute\r\npressure in pounds per square inch and T equals the absolute temperature\r\nof the gas at the meter. In boiler testing work, the evaporation should\r\nalways be reduced to that per cubic foot of gas under standard\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\n                              TABLE 50\r\n\r\n         TYPICAL ANALYSES (BY VOLUME) AND CALORIFIC VALUES OF NATURAL\r\n                         GAS FROM VARIOUS LOCALITIES\r\n\r\n+----------------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+----+-------+------+--------+\r\n|Locality of Well|  H  |CH_{4}| CO |CO_{2}| N  | O  | Heavy |H_{2}S|B. t. u.|\r\n|                |     |     |     |     |     |    |Hydro- |      |  per   |\r\n|                |     |     |     |     |     |    |carbons|      | Cubic  |\r\n|                |     |     |     |     |     |    |       |      |  Foot  |\r\n|                |     |     |     |     |     |    |       |      |Calcul- |\r\n|                |     |     |     |     |     |    |       |      |ated[49]|\r\n|----------------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+----+-------+------+--------+\r\n|Anderson, Ind.  | 1.86|93.07| 0.73| 0.26| 3.02|0.42|  0.47 | 0.15 |  1017  |\r\n|Marion, Ind.    | 1.20|93.16| 0.60| 0.30| 3.43|0.55|  0.15 | 0.20 |  1009  |\r\n|Muncie, Ind.    | 2.35|92.67| 0.45| 0.25| 3.53|0.35|  0.25 | 0.15 |  1004  |\r\n|Olean, N.

Va.\r\nNatural Gas is the Fuel Burned under these Boilers]\r\n\r\nWhen natural gas is the only fuel, the burners should be evenly\r\ndistributed over the lower portion of the boiler front. If the fuel is\r\nused as an auxiliary to coal, the burners may be placed through the fire\r\nfront. A large combustion space is essential and a volume of .75 cubic\r\nfeet per rated horse power will be found to give good results. The\r\nburners should be of a design which give the gas and air a rotary motion\r\nto insure a proper mixture. A checkerwork wall is sometimes placed in\r\nthe furnace about 3 feet from the burners to break up the flame, but\r\nwith a good design of burner this is unnecessary. Where the gas is\r\nburned alone and no grates are furnished, good results are secured by\r\ninclining the burner downward to the rear at a slight angle.\r\n\r\nBy-product Coke Oven Gas--By-product coke oven gas is a product of the\r\ndestructive distillation of coal in a distilling or by-product coke\r\noven. In this class of apparatus the gases, instead of being burned at\r\nthe point of their origin, as in a beehive or retort coke oven, are\r\ntaken from the oven through an uptake pipe, cooled and yield as\r\nby-products tar, ammonia, illuminating and fuel gas. A certain portion\r\nof the gas product is burned in the ovens and the remainder used or sold\r\nfor illuminating or fuel purposes, the methods of utilizing the gas\r\nvarying with plant operation and locality.\r\n\r\nTable 51 gives the analyses and heat value of certain samples of\r\nby-product coke oven gas utilized for fuel purposes.\r\n\r\nThis gas is nearer to natural gas in its heat value than is blast\r\nfurnace gas, and in general the remarks as to the proper methods of\r\nburning natural gas and the features to be followed in furnace design\r\nhold as well for by-product coke oven gas.\r\n\r\n                    TABLE 51\r\n\r\n         TYPICAL ANALYSES OF BY-PRODUCT\r\n                  COKE OVEN GAS\r\n\r\n+----------------------------------------------+\r\n|+------+-------------------------------------+|\r\n||CO_{2}|  O  |CO |CH_{4}| H  | N  |B.t.u. per||\r\n||      |     |   |      |    |    |Cubic Foot||\r\n|+------+-----+---+------+----+----+----------+|\r\n|| 0.75 |Trace|6.0|28.15 |53.0|12.1|   505    ||\r\n|| 2.00 |Trace|3.2|18.80 |57.2|18.0|   399    ||\r\n|| 3.20 | 0.4 |6.3|29.60 |41.6|16.1|   551    ||\r\n|| 0.80 | 1.6 |4.9|28.40 |54.2|10.1|   460    ||\r\n|+------+-----+---+------+----+----+----------+|\r\n+----------------------------------------------+\r\n\r\nThe essential difference in burning the two fuels is the pressure under\r\nwhich it reaches the gas burner. Where this is ordinarily from 4 to 8\r\nounces in the case of natural gas, it is approximately 4 inches of water\r\nin the case of by-product coke oven gas. This necessitates the use of\r\nlarger gas openings in the burners for the latter class of fuel than for\r\nthe former.\r\n\r\nBy-product coke oven gas comes to the burners saturated with moisture\r\nand provision should be made for the blowing out of water of\r\ncondensation. This gas too, carries a large proportion of tar and\r\nhydrocarbons which form a deposit in the burners and provision should be\r\nmade for cleaning this out. This is best accomplished by an attachment\r\nwhich permits the blowing out of the burners by steam.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUTILIZATION OF WASTE HEAT\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile it has been long recognized that the reclamation of heat from the\r\nwaste gases of various industrial processes would lead to a great saving\r\nin fuel and labor, the problem has, until recently, never been given the\r\nattention that its importance merits. It is true that installations have\r\nbeen made for the utilization of such gases, but in general they have\r\nconsisted simply in the placing of a given amount of boiler heating\r\nsurface in the path of the gases and those making the installations have\r\nbeen satisfied with whatever power has been generated, no attention\r\nbeing given to the proportioning of either the heating surface or the\r\ngas passages to meet the peculiar characteristics of the particular\r\nclass of waste gas available. The Babcock & Wilcox Co. has recently gone\r\ninto the question of the utilization of what has been known as waste\r\nheat with great thoroughness, and the results secured by their\r\ninstallations with practically all operations yielding such gases are\r\neminently successful.\r\n\r\n                        TABLE 52\r\n\r\n            TEMPERATURE OF WASTE GASES FROM\r\n             VARIOUS INDUSTRIAL PROCESSES\r\n\r\n+-----------------------------------------------------+\r\n|+-----------------------------------+---------------+|\r\n||Waste Heat From                    |Temperature[50]||\r\n||                                   |   Degrees     ||\r\n|+-----------------------------------+---------------+|\r\n||Brick Kilns                        |  2000-2300    ||\r\n||Zinc Furnaces                      |  2000-2300    ||\r\n||Copper Matte Reverberatory Furnaces|  2000-2200    ||\r\n||Beehive Coke Ovens                 |  1800-2000    ||\r\n||Cement Kilns                       |  1200-1600[51]||\r\n||Nickel Refining Furnaces           |  1500-1750    ||\r\n||Open Hearth Steel Furnaces         |  1100-1400    ||\r\n|+-----------------------------------+---------------+|\r\n+-----------------------------------------------------+\r\n\r\nThe power that can be obtained from waste gases depends upon their\r\ntemperature and weight, and both of these factors vary widely in\r\ndifferent commercial operations. Table 52 gives a list of certain\r\nprocesses yielding waste gases the heat of which is available for the\r\ngeneration of steam and the approximate temperature of such gases. It\r\nshould be understood that the temperatures in the table are the average\r\nof the range of a complete cycle of the operation and that the minimum\r\nand maximum temperatures may vary largely from the figures given.\r\n\r\nThe maximum available horse power that may be secured from such gases is\r\nrepresented by the formula:\r\n\r\n        W(T-t)s\r\nH. P. = -------      (23)\r\n        33,479\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere W = the weight of gases passing per hour,\r\n      T = temperature of gases entering heating surface,\r\n      t = temperature leaving heating surface,\r\n      s = specific heat of gases.\r\n\r\nThe initial temperature and the weight or volume of gas will depend, as\r\nstated, upon the process involved. The exit temperature will depend, to\r\na certain extent, upon the temperature of the entering gases, but will\r\nbe governed mainly by the efficiency of the heating surfaces installed\r\nfor the absorption of the heat.\r\n\r\nWhere the temperature of the gas available is high, approaching that\r\nfound in direct fired boiler practice, the problem is simple and the\r\nquestion of design of boiler becomes one of adapting the proper amount\r\nof heating surface to the volume of gas to be handled. With such\r\ntemperatures, and a volume of gas available approximately in accordance\r\nwith that found in direct fired boiler practice, a standard boiler or\r\none but slightly modified from the standard will serve the purpose\r\nsatisfactorily. As the temperatures become lower, however, the problem\r\nis more difficult and the departure from standard practice more radical.\r\nWith low temperature gases, to obtain a heat transfer rate at all\r\ncomparable with that found in ordinary boiler practice, the lack of\r\ntemperature must be offset by an added velocity of the gases in their\r\npassage over the heating surfaces. In securing the velocity necessary to\r\ngive a heat transfer rate with low temperature gases sufficient to make\r\nthe installation of waste heat boilers show a reasonable return on the\r\ninvestment, the frictional resistance to the gases through the boiler\r\nbecomes greatly in excess of what would be considered good practice in\r\ndirect fired boilers. Practically all operations yielding waste gases\r\nrequire that nothing be done in the way of impairing the draft at the\r\nfurnace outlet, as this might interfere with the operation of the\r\nprimary furnace. The installation of a waste heat boiler, therefore,\r\nvery frequently necessitates providing sufficient mechanical draft to\r\novercome the frictional resistance of the gases through the heating\r\nsurfaces and still leave ample draft available to meet the maximum\r\nrequirements of the primary furnace.\r\n\r\nWhere the temperature and volume of the gases are in line with what are\r\nfound in ordinary direct fired practice, the area of the gas passages\r\nmay be practically standard. With the volume of gas known, the draft\r\nloss through the heating surfaces may be obtained from experimental data\r\nand this additional draft requirement met by the installation of a stack\r\nsufficient to take care of this draft loss and still leave draft enough\r\nfor operating the furnace at its maximum capacity.\r\n\r\nWhere the temperatures are low, the added frictional resistance will\r\nordinarily be too great to allow the draft required to be secured by\r\nadditional stack height and the installation of a fan is necessary. Such\r\na fan should be capable of handling the maximum volume of gas that the\r\nfurnace may produce, and of maintaining a suction equivalent to the\r\nmaximum frictional resistance of such volume through the boiler plus the\r\nmaximum draft requirement at the furnace outlet. Stacks and fans for\r\nthis class of work should be figured on the safe side. Where a fan\r\ninstallation is necessary, the loss of draft in the fan connections\r\nshould be considered, and in figuring conservatively it should be\r\nremembered that a fan of ample size may be run as economically as a\r\nsmaller fan, whereas the smaller fan, if overloaded, is operated with a\r\nlarge loss in efficiency. In practically any installation where low\r\ntemperature gas requires a fan to give the proper heat transfer from the\r\ngases, the cost of the fan and of the energy to drive it will be more\r\nthan offset by the added power from the boiler secured by its use.\r\nFurthermore, the installation of such a fan will frequently increase the\r\ncapacity of the industrial furnace, in connection with which the waste\r\nheat boilers are installed.\r\n\r\nIn proportioning heating surfaces and gas passages for waste heat work\r\nthere are so many factors bearing directly on what constitutes the\r\nproper installation that it is impossible to set any fixed rules. Each\r\nindividual installation must be considered by itself as well as the\r\nparticular characteristics of the gases available, such as their\r\ntemperature and volume, and the presence of dust or tar-like substances,\r\nand all must be given the proper weight in the determination of the\r\ndesign of the heating surfaces and gas passages for the specific set of\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\n[Graph: Per Cent of Water Heating Surface passed over by Gases/Per Cent\r\nof the Total Amount of Steam Generated in the Boiler\r\nagainst Temperature in Degrees Fahrenheit of Hot Gases Sweeping Heating\r\nSurface\r\n\r\nFig. 31. Curve Showing Relation Between Gas Temperature, Heating Surface\r\npassed over, and Amount of Steam Generated. Ten Square Feet of Heating\r\nSurface are Assumed as Equivalent to One Boiler Horse Power]\r\n\r\nFig. 31 shows the relation of gas temperatures, heating surface passed\r\nover and work done by such surface for use in cases where the\r\ntemperatures approach those found in direct fired practice and where the\r\nvolume of gas available is approximately that with which one horse power\r\nmay be developed on 10 square feet of heating surface. The curve assumes\r\nwhat may be considered standard gas passage areas, and further, that\r\nthere is no heat absorbed by direct radiation from the fire.\r\n\r\nExperiments have shown that this curve is very nearly correct for the\r\nconditions assumed. Such being the case, its application in waste heat\r\nwork is clear. Decreasing or increasing the velocity of the gases over\r\nthe heating surfaces from what might be considered normal direct fired\r\npractice, that is, decreasing or increasing the frictional loss through\r\nthe boiler will increase or decrease the amount of heating surface\r\nnecessary to develop one boiler horse power. The application of Fig. 31\r\nto such use may best be seen by an example:\r\n\r\nAssume the entering gas temperatures to be 1470 degrees and that the\r\ngases are cooled to 570 degrees. From the curve, under what are assumed\r\nto be standard conditions, the gases have passed over 19 per cent of\r\nthe heating surface by the time they have been cooled 1470 degrees.\r\nWhen cooled to 570 degrees, 78 per cent of the heating surface has been\r\npassed over. The work done in relation to the standard of the curve is\r\nrepresented by (1470 - 570) ÷ (2500 - 500) = 45 per cent. (These\r\nfigures may also be read from the curve in terms of the per cent of the\r\nwork done by different parts of the heating surfaces.) That is, 78 per\r\ncent - 19 per cent = 59 per cent of the standard heating surface has\r\ndone 45 per cent of the standard amount of work. 59 ÷ 45 = 1.31, which\r\nis the ratio of surface of the assumed case to the standard case of the\r\ncurve. Expressed differently, there will be required 13.1 square feet\r\nof heating surface in the assumed case to develop a horse power as\r\nagainst 10 square feet in the standard case.\r\n\r\nThe gases available for this class of work are almost invariably very\r\ndirty. It is essential for the successful operation of waste-heat\r\nboilers that ample provision be made for cleaning by the installation of\r\naccess doors through which all parts of the setting may be reached. In\r\nmany instances, such as waste-heat boilers set in connection with cement\r\nkilns, settling chambers are provided for the dust before the gases\r\nreach the boiler.\r\n\r\nBy-passes for the gases should in all cases be provided to enable the\r\nboiler to be shut down for cleaning and repairs without interfering with\r\nthe operation of the primary furnace. All connections from furnace to\r\nboilers should be kept tight to prevent the infiltration of air, with\r\nthe consequent lowering of gas temperatures.\r\n\r\nAuxiliary gas or coal fired grates must be installed to insure\r\ncontinuity in the operation of the boiler where the operation of the\r\nfurnace is intermittent or where it may be desired to run the boiler\r\nwith the primary furnace not in operation. Such grates are sometimes\r\nused continuously where the gases available are not sufficient to\r\ndevelop the required horse power from a given amount of heating surface.\r\n\r\nFear has at times been expressed that certain waste gases, such as those\r\ncontaining sulphur fumes, will have a deleterious action on the heating\r\nsurface of the boiler. This feature has been carefully watched, however,\r\nand from plants in operation it would appear that in the absence of\r\nwater or steam leaks within the setting, there is no such harmful\r\naction.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 32. Babcock & Wilcox Boiler Arranged for Utilizing\r\nWaste Heat from Open Hearth Furnace. This Setting may be Modified to\r\nTake Care of Practically any Kind of Waste Gas]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHIMNEYS AND DRAFT\r\n\r\n\r\nThe height and diameter of a properly designed chimney depend upon the\r\namount of fuel to be burned, its nature, the design of the flue, with\r\nits arrangement relative to the boiler or boilers, and the altitude of\r\nthe plant above sea level. There are so many factors involved that as\r\nyet there has been produced no formula which is satisfactory in taking\r\nthem all into consideration, and the methods used for determining stack\r\nsizes are largely empirical. In this chapter a method sufficiently\r\ncomprehensive and accurate to cover all practical cases will be\r\ndeveloped and illustrated.\r\n\r\nDraft is the difference in pressure available for producing a flow of\r\nthe gases. If the gases within a stack be heated, each cubic foot will\r\nexpand, and the weight of the expanded gas per cubic foot will be less\r\nthan that of a cubic foot of the cold air outside the chimney.\r\nTherefore, the unit pressure at the stack base due to the weight of the\r\ncolumn of heated gas will be less than that due to a column of cold air.\r\nThis difference in pressure, like the difference in head of water, will\r\ncause a flow of the gases into the base of the stack. In its passage to\r\nthe stack the cold air must pass through the furnace or furnaces of the\r\nboilers connected to it, and it in turn becomes heated. This newly\r\nheated gas will also rise in the stack and the action will be\r\ncontinuous.\r\n\r\nThe intensity of the draft, or difference in pressure, is usually\r\nmeasured in inches of water. Assuming an atmospheric temperature of 62\r\ndegrees Fahrenheit and the temperature of the gases in the chimney as\r\n500 degrees Fahrenheit, and, neglecting for the moment the difference in\r\ndensity between the chimney gases and the air, the difference between\r\nthe weights of the external air and the internal flue gases per cubic\r\nfoot is .0347 pound, obtained as follows:\r\n\r\nWeight of a cubic foot of air at  62 degrees Fahrenheit = .0761 pound\r\nWeight of a cubic foot of air at 500 degrees Fahrenheit = .0414 pound\r\n                                             ------------------------\r\n                                             Difference = .0347 pound\r\n\r\nTherefore, a chimney 100 feet high, assumed for the purpose of\r\nillustration to be suspended in the air, would have a pressure exerted\r\non each square foot of its cross sectional area at its base of .0347 ×\r\n100 = 3.47 pounds. As a cubic foot of water at 62 degrees Fahrenheit\r\nweighs 62.32 pounds, an inch of water would exert a pressure of 62.32 ÷\r\n12 = 5.193 pounds per square foot. The 100-foot stack would, therefore,\r\nunder the above temperature conditions, show a draft of 3.47 ÷ 5.193 or\r\napproximately 0.67 inches of water.\r\n\r\nThe method best suited for determining the proper proportion of stacks\r\nand flues is dependent upon the principle that if the cross sectional\r\narea of the stack is sufficiently large for the volume of gases to be\r\nhandled, the intensity of the draft will depend directly upon the\r\nheight; therefore, the method of procedure is as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n1st. Select a stack of such height as will produce the draft required by\r\nthe particular character of the fuel and the amount to be burned per\r\nsquare foot of grate surface.\r\n\r\n\r\n2nd. Determine the cross sectional area necessary to handle the gases\r\nwithout undue frictional losses.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe application of these rules follows:\r\n\r\nDraft Formula--The force or intensity of the draft, not allowing for the\r\ndifference in the density of the air and of the flue gases, is given by\r\nthe formula:\r\n\r\n               / 1      1  \\\r\nD = 0.52 H × P |--- - -----|      (24)\r\n               \\ T    T_{1}/\r\n\r\nin which\r\n\r\n  D     = draft produced, measured in inches of water,\r\n  H     = height of top of stack above grate bars in feet,\r\n  P     = atmospheric pressure in pounds per square inch,\r\n  T     = absolute atmospheric temperature,\r\n  T_{1} = absolute temperature of stack gases.\r\n\r\nIn this formula no account is taken of the density of the flue gases, it\r\nbeing assumed that it is the same as that of air. Any error arising from\r\nthis assumption is negligible in practice as a factor of correction is\r\napplied in using the formula to cover the difference between the\r\ntheoretical figures and those corresponding to actual operating\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nThe force of draft at sea level (which corresponds to an atmospheric\r\npressure of 14.7 pounds per square inch) produced by a chimney 100 feet\r\nhigh with the temperature of the air at 60 degrees Fahrenheit and that\r\nof the flue gases at 500 degrees Fahrenheit is,\r\n\r\n                      /  1     1  \\\r\nD = 0.52 × 100 × 14.7 | --- - --- | = 0.67\r\n                      \\ 521   961 /\r\n\r\nUnder the same temperature conditions this chimney at an atmospheric\r\npressure of 10 pounds per square inch (which corresponds to an altitude\r\nof about 10,000 feet above sea level) would produce a draft of,\r\n\r\n                    /  1     1  \\\r\nD = 0.52 × 100 × 10 | --- - --- | = 0.45\r\n                    \\ 521   961 /\r\n\r\nFor use in applying this formula it is convenient to tabulate values of\r\nthe product\r\n\r\n                    / 1      1  \\\r\n         0.52 × 14.7|--- - -----|\r\n                    \\ T    T_{1}/\r\n\r\nwhich we will call K, for various values of T_{1}. With these values\r\ncalculated for assumed atmospheric temperature and pressure (24) becomes\r\n\r\n D = KH.      (25)\r\n\r\nFor average conditions the atmospheric pressure may be considered 14.7\r\npounds per square inch, and the temperature 60 degrees Fahrenheit. For\r\nthese values and various stack temperatures K becomes:\r\n\r\n_Temperature Stack Gases_       _Constant K_\r\n              750                  .0084\r\n              700                  .0081\r\n              650                  .0078\r\n              600                  .0075\r\n              550                  .0071\r\n              500                  .0067\r\n              450                  .0063\r\n              400                  .0058\r\n              350                  .0053\r\n\r\nDraft Losses--The intensity of the draft as determined by the above\r\nformula is theoretical and can never be observed with a draft gauge or\r\nany recording device. However, if the ashpit doors of the boiler are\r\nclosed and there is no perceptible leakage of air through the boiler\r\nsetting or flue, the draft measured at the stack base will be\r\napproximately the same as the theoretical draft. The difference existing\r\nat other times represents the pressure necessary to force the gases\r\nthrough the stack against their own inertia and the friction against the\r\nsides. This difference will increase with the velocity of the gases.\r\nWith the ashpit doors closed the volume of gases passing to the stack\r\nare a minimum and the maximum force of draft will be shown by a gauge.\r\n\r\nAs draft measurements are taken along the path of the gases, the\r\nreadings grow less as the points at which they are taken are farther\r\nfrom the stack, until in the boiler ashpit, with the ashpit doors open\r\nfor freely admitting the air, there is little or no perceptible rise in\r\nthe water of the gauge. The breeching, the boiler damper, the baffles\r\nand the tubes, and the coal on the grates all retard the passage of the\r\ngases, and the draft from the chimney is required to overcome the\r\nresistance offered by the various factors. The draft at the rear of the\r\nboiler setting where connection is made to the stack or flue may be 0.5\r\ninch, while in the furnace directly over the fire it may not be over,\r\nsay, 0.15 inch, the difference being the draft required to overcome the\r\nresistance offered in forcing the gases through the tubes and around the\r\nbaffling.\r\n\r\nOne of the most important factors to be considered in designing a stack\r\nis the pressure required to force the air for combustion through the bed\r\nof fuel on the grates. This pressure will vary with the nature of the\r\nfuel used, and in many instances will be a large percentage of the total\r\ndraft. In the case of natural draft, its measure is found directly by\r\nnoting the draft in the furnace, for with properly designed ashpit doors\r\nit is evident that the pressure under the grates will not differ\r\nsensibly from atmospheric pressure.\r\n\r\nLoss in Stack--The difference between the theoretical draft as\r\ndetermined by formula (24) and the amount lost by friction in the stack\r\nproper is the available draft, or that which the draft gauge indicates\r\nwhen connected to the base of the stack. The sum of the losses of draft\r\nin the flue, boiler and furnace must be equivalent to the available\r\ndraft, and as these quantities can be determined from record of\r\nexperiments, the problem of designing a stack becomes one of\r\nproportioning it to produce a certain available draft.\r\n\r\nThe loss in the stack due to friction of the gases can be calculated\r\nfrom the following formula:\r\n\r\n           f W² C H\r\n[Delta]D = --------      (26)\r\n              A³\r\n\r\nin which\r\n\r\n[Delta]D = draft loss in inches of water,\r\n       W = weight of gas in pounds passing per second,\r\n       C = perimeter of stack in feet,\r\n       H = height of stack in feet,\r\n       f = a constant with the following values at sea level:\r\n           .0015 for steel stacks, temperature of gases 600 degrees\r\n             Fahrenheit.\r\n           .0011 for steel stacks, temperature of gases 350 degrees\r\n             Fahrenheit.\r\n           .0020 for brick or brick-lined stacks, temperature of gases\r\n             600 degrees Fahrenheit.\r\n           .0015 for brick or brick-lined stacks, temperature of gases\r\n             350 degrees Fahrenheit.\r\n       A = Area of stack in square feet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 24,420 Horse-power Installation of Babcock & Wilcox\r\nBoilers and Superheaters, Equipped with Babcock & Wilcox Chain Grate\r\nStokers in the Quarry Street Station of the Commonwealth Edison Co.,\r\nChicago, Ill.]\r\n\r\nThis formula can also be used for calculating the frictional losses for\r\nflues, in which case, C = the perimeter of the flue in feet, H = the\r\nlength of the flue in feet, the other values being the same as for\r\nstacks.\r\n\r\nThe available draft is equal to the difference between the theoretical\r\ndraft from formula (25) and the loss from formula (26), hence:\r\n\r\n                               f W² C H\r\nd^{1} = available draft = KH - --------      (27)\r\n

Diameter of Stacks and Horse Power they will Serve\r\n\r\nComputed from Formula (28). For brick or brick-lined stacks, increase\r\nthe diameter 6 per cent]\r\n\r\nHeight and Diameter of Stacks--From this formula (27) it becomes evident\r\nthat a stack of certain diameter, if it be increased in height, will\r\nproduce the same available draft as one of larger diameter, the\r\nadditional height being required to overcome the added frictional loss.\r\nIt follows that among the various stacks that would meet the\r\nrequirements of a particular case there must be one which can be\r\nconstructed more cheaply than the others. It has been determined from\r\nthe relation of the cost of stacks to their diameters and heights, in\r\nconnection with the formula for available draft, that the minimum cost\r\nstack has a diameter dependent solely upon the horse power of the\r\nboilers it serves, and a height proportional to the available draft\r\nrequired.\r\n\r\nAssuming 120 pounds of flue gas per hour for each boiler horse power,\r\nwhich provides for ordinary overloads and the use of poor coal, the\r\nmethod above stated gives:\r\n\r\nFor an unlined steel stack--\r\n\r\ndiameter in inches = 4.68 (H. P.)^{2/5}      (28)\r\n\r\nFor a stack lined with masonry--\r\n\r\ndiameter in inches = 4.92 (H. P.)^{2/5}      (29)\r\n\r\nIn both of these formulae H. P. = the rated horse power of the boiler.\r\n\r\nFrom this formula the curve, Fig. 33, has been calculated and from it\r\nthe stack diameter for any boiler horse power can be selected.\r\n\r\nFor stoker practice where a large stack serves a number of boilers, the\r\narea is usually made about one-third more than the above rules call for,\r\nwhich allows for leakage of air through the setting of any idle boilers,\r\nirregularities in operating conditions, etc.\r\n\r\nStacks with diameters determined as above will give an available draft\r\nwhich bears a constant ratio of the theoretical draft, and allowing for\r\nthe cooling of the gases in their passage upward through the stack, this\r\nratio is 8. Using this factor in formula (25), and transposing, the\r\nheight of the chimney becomes,\r\n\r\n\r\n    d^{1}\r\nH = -----      (30)\r\n    .8 K\r\n\r\nWhere H = height of stack in feet above the level of the grates,\r\n  d^{1} = available draft required,\r\n      K = constant as in formula.\r\n\r\nLosses in Flues--The loss of draft in straight flues due to friction and\r\ninertia can be calculated approximately from formula (26), which was\r\ngiven for loss in stacks. It is to be borne in mind that C in this\r\nformula is the actual perimeter of the flue and is least, relative to\r\nthe cross sectional area, when the section is a circle, is greater for a\r\nsquare section, and greatest for a rectangular section. The retarding\r\neffect of a square flue is 12 per cent greater than that of a circular\r\nflue of the same area and that of a rectangular with sides as 1 and 1½,\r\n15 per cent greater. The greater resistance of the more or less uneven\r\nbrick or concrete flue is provided for in the value of the constants\r\ngiven for formula (26). Both steel and brick flues should be short and\r\nshould have as near a circular or square cross section as possible.\r\nAbrupt turns are to be avoided, but as long easy sweeps require valuable\r\nspace, it is often desirable to increase the height of the stack rather\r\nthan to take up added space in the boiler room. Short right-angle turns\r\nreduce the draft by an amount which can be roughly approximated as equal\r\nto 0.05 inch for each turn. The turns which the gases make in leaving\r\nthe damper box of a boiler, in entering a horizontal flue and in turning\r\nup into a stack should always be considered. The cross sectional areas\r\nof the passages leading from the boilers to the stack should be of ample\r\nsize to provide against undue frictional loss. It is poor economy to\r\nrestrict the size of the flue and thus make additional stack height\r\nnecessary to overcome the added friction. The general practice is to\r\nmake flue areas the same or slightly larger than that of the stack;\r\nthese should be, preferably, at least 20 per cent greater, and a safe\r\nrule to follow in figuring flue areas is to allow 35 square feet per\r\n1000 horse power. It is unnecessary to maintain the same size of flue\r\nthe entire distance behind a row of boilers, and the areas at any point\r\nmay be made proportional to the volume of gases that will pass that\r\npoint. That is, the areas may be reduced as connections to various\r\nboilers are passed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 6000 Horse-power Installation of Babcock & Wilcox Boilers\r\nat the United States Navy Yard, Washington, D. C.]\r\n\r\nWith circular steel flues of approximately the same size as the stacks,\r\nor reduced proportionally to the volume of gases they will handle, a\r\nconvenient rule is to allow 0.1 inch draft loss per 100 feet of flue\r\nlength and 0.05 inch for each right-angle turn. These figures are also\r\ngood for square or rectangular steel flues with areas sufficiently large\r\nto provide against excessive frictional loss. For losses in brick or\r\nconcrete flues, these figures should be doubled.\r\n\r\nUnderground flues are less desirable than overhead or rear flues for the\r\nreason that in most instances the gases will have to make more turns\r\nwhere underground flues are used and because the cross sectional area of\r\nsuch flues will oftentimes be decreased on account of an accumulation of\r\ndirt or water which it may be impossible to remove.\r\n\r\nIn tall buildings, such as office buildings, it is frequently necessary\r\nin order to carry spent gases above the roofs, to install a stack the\r\nheight of which is out of all proportion to the requirements of the\r\nboilers. In such cases it is permissible to decrease the diameter of a\r\nstack, but care must be taken that this decrease is not sufficient to\r\ncause a frictional loss in the stack as great as the added draft\r\nintensity due to the increase in height, which local conditions make\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\nIn such cases also the fact that the stack diameter is permissibly\r\ndecreased is no reason why flue sizes connecting to the stack should be\r\ndecreased. These should still be figured in proportion to the area of\r\nthe stack that would be furnished under ordinary conditions or with an\r\nallowance of 35 square feet per 1000 horse power, even though the cross\r\nsectional area appears out of proportion to the stack area.\r\n\r\nLoss in Boiler--In calculating the available draft of a chimney 120\r\npounds per hour has been used as the weight of the gases per boiler\r\nhorse power. This covers an overload of the boiler to an extent of 50\r\nper cent and provides for the use of poor coal. The loss in draft\r\nthrough a boiler proper will depend upon its type and baffling and will\r\nincrease with the per cent of rating at which it is run. No figures can\r\nbe given which will cover all conditions, but for approximate use in\r\nfiguring the available draft necessary it may be assumed that the loss\r\nthrough a boiler will be 0.25 inch where the boiler is run at rating,\r\n0.40 inch where it is run at 150 per cent of its rated capacity, and\r\n0.70 inch where it is run at 200 per cent of its rated capacity.\r\n\r\nLoss in Furnace--The draft loss in the furnace or through the fuel bed\r\nvaries between wide limits. The air necessary for combustion must pass\r\nthrough the interstices of the coal on the grate. Where these are large,\r\nas is the case with broken coal, but little pressure is required to\r\nforce the air through the bed; but if they are small, as with bituminous\r\nslack or small sizes of anthracite, a much greater pressure is needed.\r\nIf the draft is insufficient the coal will accumulate on the grates and\r\na dead smoky fire will result with the accompanying poor combustion; if\r\nthe draft is too great, the coal may be rapidly consumed on certain\r\nportions of the grate, leaving the fire thin in spots and a portion of\r\nthe grates uncovered with the resulting losses due to an excessive\r\namount of air.\r\n\r\n[Graph: Force of Draft between Furnace and Ash Pit--Inches of Water\r\nagainst Pounds of Coal burned per Square Foot of Grate Surface per Hour\r\n\r\nFig. 34. Draft Required at Different Combustion Rates for Various Kinds\r\nof Coal]\r\n\r\nDraft Required for Different Fuels--For every kind of fuel and rate of\r\ncombustion there is a certain draft with which the best general results\r\nare obtained. A comparatively light draft is best with the free burning\r\nbituminous coals and the amount to use increases as the percentage of\r\nvolatile matter diminishes and the fixed carbon increases, being highest\r\nfor the small sizes of anthracites. Numerous other factors such as the\r\nthickness of fires, the percentage of ash and the air spaces in the\r\ngrates bear directly on this question of the draft best suited to a\r\ngiven combustion rate. The effect of these factors can only be found by\r\nexperiment. It is almost impossible to show by one set of curves the\r\nfurnace draft required at various rates of combustion for all of the\r\ndifferent conditions of fuel, etc., that may be met. The curves in Fig.\r\n34, however, give the furnace draft necessary to burn various kinds of\r\ncoal at the combustion rates indicated by the abscissae, for a general\r\nset of conditions. These curves have been plotted from the records of\r\nnumerous tests and allow a safe margin for economically burning coals of\r\nthe kinds noted.\r\n\r\nRate of Combustion--The amount of coal which can be burned per hour per\r\nsquare foot of grate surface is governed by the character of the coal\r\nand the draft available. When the boiler and grate are properly\r\nproportioned, the efficiency will be practically the same, within\r\nreasonable limits, for different rates of combustion. The area of the\r\ngrate, and the ratio of this area to the boiler heating surface will\r\ndepend upon the nature of the fuel to be burned, and the stack should be\r\nso designed as to give a draft sufficient to burn the maximum amount of\r\nfuel per square foot of grate surface corresponding to the maximum\r\nevaporative requirements of the boiler.\r\n\r\nSolution of a Problem--The stack diameter can be determined from the\r\ncurve, Fig. 33. The height can be determined by adding the draft losses\r\nin the furnace, through the boiler and flues, and computing from formula\r\n(30) the height necessary to give this draft.\r\n\r\nExample: Proportion a stack for boilers rated at 2000 horse power,\r\nequipped with stokers, and burning bituminous coal that will evaporate 8\r\npounds of water from and at 212 degrees Fahrenheit per pound of fuel;\r\nthe ratio of boiler heating surface to grate surface being 50:1; the\r\nflues being 100 feet long and containing two right-angle turns; the\r\nstack to be able to handle overloads of 50 per cent; and the rated horse\r\npower of the boilers based on 10 square feet of heating surface per\r\nhorse power.\r\n\r\nThe atmospheric temperature may be assumed as 60 degrees Fahrenheit and\r\nthe flue temperatures at the maximum overload as 550 degrees Fahrenheit.\r\nThe grate surface equals 400 square feet.\r\n\r\n                                  2000 × 34½\r\nThe total coal burned at rating = ---------- = 8624 pounds.\r\n                                      8\r\n\r\nThe coal per square foot of grate surface per hour at rating =\r\n\r\n8624\r\n---- = 22 pounds.\r\n 400\r\n\r\nFor 50 per cent overload the combustion rate will be approximately 60\r\nper cent greater than this or 1.60 × 22 = 35 pounds per square foot of\r\ngrate surface per hour. The furnace draft required for the combustion\r\nrate, from the curve, Fig. 34, is 0.6 inch. The loss in the boiler will\r\nbe 0.4 inch, in the flue 0.1 inch, and in the turns 2 × 0.05 = 0.1 inch.\r\nThe available draft required at the base of the stack is, therefore,\r\n\r\n       _Inches_\r\nBoiler   0.4\r\nFurnace  0.6\r\nFlues    0.1\r\nTurns    0.1\r\n         ---\r\n  Total  1.2\r\n\r\nSince the available draft is 80 per cent of the theoretical draft, this\r\ndraft due to the height required is 1.2 ÷ .8 = 1.5 inch.\r\n\r\nThe chimney constant for temperatures of 60 degrees Fahrenheit and 550\r\ndegrees Fahrenheit is .0071 and from formula (30),\r\n\r\n     1.5\r\nH = ----- = 211 feet.\r\n    .0071\r\n\r\nIts diameter from curve in Fig. 33 is 96 inches if unlined, and 102\r\ninches inside if lined with masonry. The cross sectional area of the\r\nflue should be approximately 70 square feet at the point where the total\r\namount of gas is to be handled, tapering to the boiler farthest from the\r\nstack to a size which will depend upon the size of the boiler units\r\nused.\r\n\r\nCorrection in Stack Sizes for Altitudes--It has ordinarily been assumed\r\nthat a stack height for altitude will be increased inversely as the\r\nratio of the barometric pressure at the altitude to that at sea level,\r\nand that the stack diameter will increase inversely as the two-fifths\r\npower of this ratio. Such a relation has been based on the assumption of\r\nconstant draft measured in inches of water at the base of the stack for\r\na given rate of operation of the boilers, regardless of altitude.\r\n\r\nIf the assumption be made that boilers, flues and furnace remain the\r\nsame, and further that the increased velocity of a given weight of air\r\npassing through the furnace at a higher altitude would have no effect on\r\nthe combustion, the theory has been advanced[53] that a different law\r\napplies.\r\n\r\nUnder the above assumptions, whenever a stack is working at its maximum\r\ncapacity at any altitude, the entire draft is utilized in overcoming the\r\nvarious resistances, each of which is proportional to the square of the\r\nvelocity of the gases. Since boiler areas are fixed, all velocities may\r\nbe related to a common velocity, say, that within the stack, and all\r\nresistances may, therefore, be expressed as proportional to the square\r\nof the chimney velocity. The total resistance to flow, in terms of\r\nvelocity head, may be expressed in terms of weight of a column of\r\nexternal air, the numerical value of such head being independent of the\r\nbarometric pressure. Likewise the draft of a stack, expressed in height\r\nof column of external air, will be numerically independent of the\r\nbarometric pressure. It is evident, therefore, that if a given boiler\r\nplant, with its stack operated with a fixed fuel, be transplanted from\r\nsea level to an altitude, assuming the temperatures remain constant, the\r\ntotal draft head measured in height of column of external air will be\r\nnumerically constant. The velocity of chimney gases will, therefore,\r\nremain the same at altitude as at sea level and the weight of gases\r\nflowing per second with a fixed velocity will be proportional to the\r\natmospheric density or inversely proportional to the normal barometric\r\npressure.\r\n\r\nTo develop a given horse power requires a constant weight of chimney gas\r\nand air for combustion. Hence, as the altitude is increased, the density\r\nis decreased and, for the assumptions given above, the velocity through\r\nthe furnace, the boiler passes, breeching and flues must be\r\ncorrespondingly greater at altitude than at sea level. The mean\r\nvelocity, therefore, for a given boiler horse power and constant weight\r\nof gases will be inversely proportional to the barometric pressure and\r\nthe velocity head measured in column of external air will be inversely\r\nproportional to the square of the barometric pressure.\r\n\r\nFor stacks operating at altitude it is necessary not only to increase\r\nthe height but also the diameter, as there is an added resistance within\r\nthe stack due to the added friction from the additional height. This\r\nfrictional loss can be compensated by a suitable increase in the\r\ndiameter and when so compensated, it is evident that on the assumptions\r\nas given, the chimney height would have to be increased at a ratio\r\ninversely proportional to the square of the normal barometric pressure.\r\n\r\nIn designing a boiler for high altitudes, as already stated, the\r\nassumption is usually made that a given grade of fuel will require the\r\nsame draft measured in inches of water at the boiler damper as at sea\r\nlevel, and this leads to making the stack height inversely as the\r\nbarometric pressures, instead of inversely as the square of the\r\nbarometric pressures. The correct height, no doubt, falls somewhere\r\nbetween the two values as larger flues are usually used at the higher\r\naltitudes, whereas to obtain the ratio of the squares, the flues must be\r\nthe same size in each case, and again the effect of an increased\r\nvelocity of a given weight of air through the fire at a high altitude,\r\non the combustion, must be neglected. In making capacity tests with coal\r\nfuel, no difference has been noted in the rates of combustion for a\r\ngiven draft suction measured by a water column at high and low\r\naltitudes, and this would make it appear that the correct height to use\r\nis more nearly that obtained by the inverse ratio of the barometric\r\nreadings than by the inverse ratio of the squares of the barometric\r\nreadings. If the assumption is made that the value falls midway between\r\nthe two formulae, the error in using a stack figured in the ordinary way\r\nby making the height inversely proportional to the barometric readings\r\nwould differ about 10 per cent in capacity at an altitude of 10,000\r\nfeet, which difference is well within the probable variation of the size\r\ndetermined by different methods. It would, therefore, appear that ample\r\naccuracy is obtained in all cases by simply making the height inversely\r\nproportional to the barometric readings and increasing the diameter so\r\nthat the stacks used at high altitudes have the same frictional\r\nresistance as those used at low altitudes, although, if desired, the\r\nstack may be made somewhat higher at high altitudes than this rule calls\r\nfor in order to be on the safe side.\r\n\r\nThe increase of stack diameter necessary to maintain the same friction\r\nloss is inversely as the two-fifths power of the barometric pressure.\r\n\r\nTable 54 gives the ratio of barometric readings of various altitudes to\r\nsea level, values for the square of this ratio and values of the\r\ntwo-fifths power of this ratio.\r\n\r\n                                 TABLE 54\r\n\r\n                 STACK CAPACITIES, CORRECTION FACTORS FOR\r\n                                ALTITUDES\r\n\r\n _______________________________________________________________________\r\n|                |           |                 |       |                |\r\n|    Altitude    |           |        R        |       |    R^{2/5}     |\r\n| Height in Feet |  Normal   | Ratio Barometer |       | Ratio Increase |\r\n|     Above      | Barometer |     Reading     |   R²  |    in Stack    |\r\n|   Sea Level    |           |  Sea Level to   |       |    Diameter    |\r\n|                |           |    Altitude     |       |                |\r\n|________________|___________|_________________|_______|________________|\r\n|                |           |                 |       |                |\r\n|         0      |   30.00   |      1.000      | 1.000 |     1.000      |\r\n|      1000      |   28.88   |      1.039      | 1.079 |     1.015      |\r\n|      2000      |   27.80   |      1.079      | 1.064 |     1.030      |\r\n|      3000      |   26.76   |      1.121      | 1.257 |     1.047      |\r\n|      4000      |   25.76   |      1.165      | 1.356 |     1.063      |\r\n|      5000      |   24.79   |      1.210      | 1.464 |     1.079      |\r\n|      6000      |   23.87   |      1.257      | 1.580 |     1.096      |\r\n|      7000      |   22.97   |      1.306      | 1.706 |     1.113      |\r\n|      8000      |   22.11   |      1.357      | 1.841 |     1.130      |\r\n|      9000      |   21.28   |      1.410      | 1.988 |     1.147      |\r\n|     10000      |   20.49   |      1.464      | 2.144 |     1.165      |\r\n|________________|___________|_________________|_______|________________|\r\n\r\nThese figures show that the altitude affects the height to a much\r\ngreater extent than the diameter and that practically no increase in\r\ndiameter is necessary for altitudes up to 3000 feet.\r\n\r\nFor high altitudes the increase in stack height necessary is, in some\r\ncases, such as to make the proportion of height to diameter\r\nimpracticable.

This table is a modification of Mr. William Kent's stack table\r\nand is calculated from his formula. Provided no unusual conditions are\r\nencountered, it is reliable for the ordinary rates of combustion with\r\nbituminous coals. It is figured on a consumption of 5 pounds of coal\r\nburned per hour per boiler horse power developed, this figure giving a\r\nfairly liberal allowance for the use of poor coal and for a reasonable\r\noverload. When the coal used is a low grade bituminous of the Middle or\r\nWestern States, it is strongly recommended that these sizes be increased\r\nmaterially, such an increase being from 25 to 60 per cent, depending\r\nupon the nature of the coal and the capacity desired. For the coal\r\nburned per hour for any size stack given in the table, the values should\r\nbe multiplied by 5.\r\n\r\nA convenient rule for large stacks, 200 feet high and over, is to\r\nprovide 30 square feet of cross sectional area per 1000 rated horse\r\npower.\r\n\r\nStacks for Oil Fuel--The requirements of stacks connected to boilers\r\nunder which oil fuel is burned are entirely different from those where\r\ncoal is used. While more attention has been paid to the matter of stack\r\nsizes for oil fuel in recent years, there has not as yet been gathered\r\nthe large amount of experimental data available for use in designing\r\ncoal stacks.\r\n\r\nIn the case of oil-fired boilers the loss of draft through the fuel bed\r\nis partially eliminated. While there may be practically no loss through\r\nany checkerwork admitting air to the furnace when a boiler is new, the\r\nareas for the air passage in this checkerwork will in a short time be\r\ndecreased, due to the silt which is present in practically all fuel oil.\r\nThe loss in draft through the boiler proper at a given rating will be\r\nless than in the case of coal-fired boilers, this being due to a\r\ndecrease in the volume of the gases. Further, the action of the oil\r\nburner itself is to a certain extent that of a forced draft. To offset\r\nthis decrease in draft requirement, the temperature of the gases\r\nentering the stack will be somewhat lower where oil is used than where\r\ncoal is used, and the draft that a stack of a given height would give,\r\ntherefore, decreases. The factors as given above, affecting as they do\r\nthe intensity of the draft, affect directly the height of the stack to\r\nbe used.\r\n\r\nAs already stated, the volume of gases from oil-fired boilers being less\r\nthan in the case of coal, makes it evident that the area of stacks for\r\noil fuel will be less than for coal. It is assumed that these areas will\r\nvary directly as the volume of the gases to be handled, and this volume\r\nfor oil may be taken as approximately 60 per cent of that for coal.\r\n\r\nIn designing stacks for oil fuel there are two features which must not\r\nbe overlooked. In coal-firing practice there is rarely danger of too\r\nmuch draft. In the burning of oil, however, this may play an important\r\npart in the reduction of plant economy, the influence of excessive draft\r\nbeing more apparent where the load on the plant may be reduced at\r\nintervals. The reason for this is that, aside from a slight decrease in\r\ntemperature at reduced loads, the tendency, due to careless firing, is\r\ntoward a constant gas flow through the boiler regardless of the rate of\r\noperation, with the corresponding increase of excess air at light loads.\r\nWith excessive stack height, economical operation at varying loads is\r\nalmost impossible with hand control. With automatic control, however,\r\nwhere stacks are necessarily high to take care of known peaks, under\r\nlighter loads this economical operation becomes less difficult. For this\r\nreason the question of designing a stack for a plant where the load is\r\nknown to be nearly a constant is easier than for a plant where the load\r\nwill vary over a wide range. While great care must be taken to avoid\r\nexcessive draft, still more care must be taken to assure a draft suction\r\nwithin all parts of the setting under any and all conditions of\r\noperation. It is very easily possible to more than offset the economy\r\ngained through low draft, by the losses due to setting deterioration,\r\nresulting from such lack of suction. Under conditions where the suction\r\nis not sufficient to carry off the products of combustion, the action of\r\nthe heat on the setting brickwork will cause its rapid failure.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 7800 Horse-power Installation of Babcock & Wilcox\r\nBoilers, Equipped with Babcock & Wilcox Chain Grate Stokers at the\r\nMetropolitan West Side Elevated Ry. Co., Chicago, Ill.]\r\n\r\nIt becomes evident, therefore, that the question of stack height for\r\noil-fired boilers is one which must be considered with the greatest of\r\ncare. The designer, on the one hand, must guard against the evils of\r\nexcessive draft with the view to plant economy, and, on the other,\r\nagainst the evils of lack of draft from the viewpoint of upkeep cost.\r\nStacks for this work should be proportioned to give ample draft for the\r\nmaximum overload that a plant will be called upon to carry, all\r\nconditions of overload carefully considered. At the same time, where\r\nthis maximum overload is figured liberally enough to insure a draft\r\nsuction within the setting under all conditions, care must be taken\r\nagainst the installation of a stack which would give more than this\r\nmaximum draft.\r\n\r\n                        TABLE 56\r\n\r\n                STACK SIZES FOR OIL FUEL\r\n\r\n      ADAPTED FROM C.

Sizes as given good for 50\r\nper cent overloads.\r\n\r\nBased on centrally located stacks, short direct flues and ordinary\r\noperating efficiencies.\r\n\r\nTable 56 gives the sizes of stacks, and horse power which they will\r\nserve for oil fuel. This table is, in modified form, one calculated by\r\nMr. C. R. Weymouth after an exhaustive study of data pertaining to the\r\nsubject, and will ordinarily give satisfactory results.\r\n\r\nStacks for Blast Furnace Gas Work--For boilers burning blast furnace\r\ngas, as in the case of oil-fired boilers, stack sizes as suited for coal\r\nfiring will have to be modified. The diameter of stacks for this work\r\nshould be approximately the same as for coal-fired boilers. The volume\r\nof gases would be slightly greater than from a coal fire and would\r\ndecrease the draft with a given stack, but such a decrease due to volume\r\nis about offset by an increase due to somewhat higher temperatures in\r\nthe case of the blast furnace gases.\r\n\r\nRecords show that with this class of fuel 175 per cent of the rated\r\ncapacity of a boiler can be developed with a draft at the boiler damper\r\nof from 0.75 inch to 1.0 inch, and it is well to limit the height of\r\nstacks to one which will give this draft as a maximum. A stack of proper\r\ndiameter, 130 feet high above the ground, will produce such a draft and\r\nthis height should ordinarily not be exceeded. Until recently the\r\nquestion of economy in boilers fired with blast furnace gas has not been\r\nconsidered, but, aside from the economical standpoint, excessive draft\r\nshould be guarded against in order to lower the upkeep cost.\r\n\r\nStacks should be made of sufficient height to produce a draft that will\r\ndevelop the maximum capacity required, and this draft decreased\r\nproportionately for loads under the maximum by damper regulation. The\r\namount of gas fed to a boiler for any given rating is a fixed quantity\r\nand if a draft in excess of that required for that particular rate of\r\noperation is supplied, economy is decreased and the wear and tear on the\r\nsetting is materially increased. Excess air which is drawn in, either\r\nthrough or around the gas burners by an excessive draft, will decrease\r\neconomy, as in any other class of work. Again, as in oil-fired practice,\r\nit is essential on the other hand that a suction be maintained within\r\nall parts of the setting, in this case not only to provide against\r\nsetting deterioration but to protect the operators from leakage of gas\r\nwhich is disagreeable and may be dangerous. Aside from the intensity of\r\nthe draft, a poor mixture of the gas and air or a \"laneing\" action may\r\nlead to secondary combustion with the possibility of dangerous\r\nexplosions within the setting, may cause a pulsating action within the\r\nsetting, may increase the exit temperatures to a point where there is\r\ndanger of burning out damper boxes, and, in general, is hard on the\r\nsetting. It is highly essential, therefore, that the furnace be properly\r\nconstructed to meet the draft which will be available.\r\n\r\nStacks for Wood-fired Boilers--For boilers using wood as fuel, there is\r\nbut little data upon which to base stack sizes. The loss of draft\r\nthrough the bed of fuel will vary over limits even wider than in the\r\ncase of coal, for in this class of fuel the moisture may run from\r\npractically 0.0 per cent to over 60 per cent, and the methods of\r\nhandling and firing are radically different for the different classes of\r\nwood (see chapter on Wood-burning Furnaces). As economy is ordinarily of\r\nlittle importance, high stack temperatures may be expected, and often\r\nunavoidably large quantities of excess air are supplied due to the\r\nmethod of firing. In general, it may be stated that for this class of\r\nfuel the diameter of stacks should be at least as great as for coal-fired\r\nboilers, while the height may be slightly decreased. It is far the best\r\nplan in designing a stack for boilers using wood fuel to consider each\r\nindividual set of conditions that exist, rather than try to follow any\r\ngeneral rule.\r\n\r\nOne factor not to be overlooked in stacks for wood burning is their\r\nlocation. The fine particles of this fuel are often carried unconsumed\r\nthrough the boiler, and where the stack is not on top of the boiler,\r\nthese particles may accumulate in the base of the stack below the point\r\nat which the flue enters. Where there is any air leakage through the\r\nbase of such a stack, this fuel may become ignited and the stack burned.\r\nWhere there is a possibility of such action taking place, it is well to\r\nline the stack with fire brick for a portion of its height.\r\n\r\nDraft Gauges--The ordinary form of draft gauge, Fig. 35, which consists\r\nof a U-tube, containing water, lacks sensitiveness in measuring such\r\nslight pressure differences as usually exist, and for that reason gauges\r\nwhich multiply the draft indications are more convenient and are much\r\nused.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 35. U-tube Draft Gauge]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 36. Barrus Draft Gauge]\r\n\r\nAn instrument which has given excellent results is one introduced by Mr.\r\nG. H. Barrus, which multiplies the ordinary indications as many times as\r\ndesired. This is illustrated in Fig. 36, and consists of a U-tube made\r\nof one-half inch glass, surmounted by two larger tubes, or chambers,\r\neach having a diameter of 2½ inches. Two different liquids which will\r\nnot mix, and which are of different color, are used, usually alcohol\r\ncolored red and a certain grade of lubricating oil. The movement of the\r\nline of demarcation is proportional to the difference in the areas of\r\nthe chambers and the U-tube connecting them. The instrument is\r\ncalibrated by comparison with the ordinary U-tube gauge.\r\n\r\nIn the Ellison form of gauge the lower portion of the ordinary U-tube\r\nhas been replaced by a tube slightly inclined to the horizontal, as\r\nshown in Fig. 37. By this arrangement any vertical motion in the\r\nright-hand upright tube causes a very much greater travel of the liquid\r\nin the inclined tube, thus permitting extremely small variation in the\r\nintensity of the draft to be read with facility.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 37. Ellison Draft Gauge]\r\n\r\nThe gauge is first leveled by means of the small level attached to it,\r\nboth legs being open to the atmosphere. The liquid is then adjusted\r\nuntil its meniscus rests at the zero point on the left. The right-hand\r\nleg is then connected to the source of draft by means of a piece of\r\nrubber tubing. Under these circumstances, a rise of level of one inch in\r\nthe right-hand vertical tube causes the meniscus in the inclined tube to\r\npass from the point 0 to 1.0. The scale is divided into tenths of an\r\ninch, and the sub-divisions are hundredths of an inch.\r\n\r\nThe makers furnish a non-drying oil for the liquid, usually a 300\r\ndegrees test refined petroleum.\r\n\r\nA very convenient form of the ordinary U-tube gauge is known as the\r\nPeabody gauge, and it is shown in Fig. 38. This is a small modified\r\nU-tube with a sliding scale between the two legs of the U and with\r\nconnections such that either a draft suction or a draft pressure may be\r\ntaken. The tops of the sliding pieces extending across the tubes are\r\nplaced at the bottom of the meniscus and accurate readings in hundredths\r\nof an inch are obtained by a vernier.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 38. Peabody Draft Gauge]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEFFICIENCY AND CAPACITY OF BOILERS\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo of the most important operating factors entering into the\r\nconsideration of what constitutes a satisfactory boiler are its\r\nefficiency and capacity. The relation of these factors to one another\r\nwill be considered later under the selection of boilers with reference\r\nto the work they are to accomplish. The present chapter deals with the\r\nefficiency and capacity only with a view to making clear exactly what is\r\nmeant by these terms as applied to steam generating apparatus, together\r\nwith the methods of determining these factors by tests.\r\n\r\nEfficiency--The term \"efficiency\", specifically applied to a steam\r\nboiler, is the ratio of heat absorbed by the boiler in the generation of\r\nsteam to the total amount of heat available in the medium utilized in\r\nsecuring such generation. When this medium is a solid fuel, such as\r\ncoal, it is impossible to secure the complete combustion of the total\r\namount fed to the boiler. A portion is bound to drop through the grates\r\nwhere it becomes mixed with the ash and, remaining unburned, produces no\r\nheat. Obviously, it is unfair to charge the boiler with the failure to\r\nabsorb the portion of available heat in the fuel that is wasted in this\r\nway. On the other hand, the boiler user must pay for such waste and is\r\njustified in charging it against the combined boiler and furnace. Due to\r\nthis fact, the efficiency of a boiler, as ordinarily stated, is in\r\nreality the combined efficiency of the boiler, furnace and grate, and\r\n\r\n    Efficiency of boiler,}   Heat absorbed per pound of fuel\r\n      furnace and grate  } = -------------------------------      (31)\r\n                              Heat value per pound of fuel\r\n\r\n\r\nThe efficiency will be the same whether based on dry fuel or on fuel as\r\nfired, including its content of moisture. For example: If the coal\r\ncontained 3 per cent of moisture, the efficiency would be\r\n\r\n        Heat absorbed per pound of dry coal × 0.97\r\n        ------------------------------------------\r\n         Heat value per pound of dry coal × 0.97\r\n\r\nwhere 0.97 cancels and the formula becomes (31).\r\n\r\nThe heat supplied to the boiler is due to the combustible portion of\r\nfuel which is actually burned, irrespective of what proportion of the\r\ntotal combustible fired may be.[54] This fact has led to the use of a\r\nsecond efficiency basis on combustible and which is called the\r\nefficiency of boiler and furnace[55], namely,\r\n\r\n    Efficiency of boiler and furnace[55]\r\n\r\n      Heat absorbed per pound of combustible[56]\r\n    = --------------------------------------      (32)\r\n       Heat value per pound of combustible\r\n\r\n\r\nThe efficiency so determined is used in comparing the relative\r\nperformance of boilers, irrespective of the type of grates used under\r\nthem. If the loss of fuel through the grates could be entirely overcome,\r\nthe efficiencies obtained by (31) and (32) would obviously be the same.\r\nHence, in the case of liquid and gaseous fuels, where there is\r\npractically no waste, these efficiencies are almost identical.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to\r\ndetermine the actual efficiency of a boiler alone, as distinguished from\r\nthe combined efficiency of boiler, grate and furnace. This is due to the\r\nfact that the losses due to excess air cannot be correctly attributed to\r\neither the boiler or the furnace, but only to a combination of the\r\ncomplete apparatus. Attempts have been made to devise methods for\r\ndividing the losses proportionately between the furnace and the boiler,\r\nbut such attempts are unsatisfactory and it is impossible to determine\r\nthe efficiency of a boiler apart from that of a furnace in such a way as\r\nto make such determination of any practical value or in a way that might\r\nnot lead to endless dispute, were the question to arise in the case of a\r\nguaranteed efficiency. From the boiler manufacturer's standpoint, the\r\nonly way of establishing an efficiency that has any value when\r\nguarantees are to be met, is to require the grate or stoker manufacturer\r\nto make certain guarantees as to minimum CO_{2}, maximum CO, and that\r\nthe amount of combustible in the ash and blown away with the flue gases\r\ndoes not exceed a certain percentage. With such a guarantee, the\r\nefficiency should be based on the combined furnace and boiler.\r\n\r\nGeneral practice, however, has established the use of the efficiency\r\nbased upon combustible as representing the efficiency of the boiler\r\nalone. When such an efficiency is used, its exact meaning, as pointed\r\nout on opposite page, should be realized.\r\n\r\nThe computation of the efficiencies described on opposite page is best\r\nillustrated by example.\r\n\r\nAssume the following data to be determined from an actual boiler trial.\r\n\r\nSteam pressure by gauge, 200 pounds.\r\nFeed temperature, 180 degrees.\r\nTotal weight of coal fired, 17,500 pounds.\r\nPercentage of moisture in coal, 3 per cent.\r\nTotal ash and refuse, 2396 pounds.\r\nTotal water evaporated, 153,543 pounds.\r\nPer cent of moisture in steam, 0.5 per cent.\r\nHeat value per pound of dry coal, 13,516.\r\nHeat value per pound of combustible, 15,359.\r\n\r\nThe factor of evaporation for such a set of conditions is 1.0834. The\r\nactual evaporation corrected for moisture in the steam is 152,775 and\r\nthe equivalent evaporation from and at 212 degrees is, therefore,\r\n165,516 pounds.\r\n\r\nThe total dry fuel will be 17,500 × .97 = 16,975, and the evaporation\r\nper pound of dry fuel from and at 212 degrees will be 165,516 ÷ 16,975 =\r\n9.75 pounds. The heat absorbed per pound of dry fuel will, therefore, be\r\n9.75 × 970.4 = 9461 B. t. u. Hence, the efficiency by (31) will be 9461\r\n÷ 13,516 = 70.0 per cent. The total combustible burned will be 16,975\r\n- 2396 = 14,579, and the evaporation from and at 212 degrees per pound\r\nof combustible will be 165,516 ÷ 14,579 = 11.35 pounds. Hence, the\r\nefficiency based on combustible from (32) will be (11.35 × 97.04) ÷\r\n15,359 = 71.79.[**should be 71.71]\r\n\r\nFor approximate results, a chart may be used to take the place of a\r\ncomputation of efficiency. Fig. 39 shows such a chart based on the\r\nevaporation per pound of dry fuel and the heat value per pound of dry\r\nfuel, from which efficiencies may be read directly to within one-half of\r\none per cent. It is used as follows: From the intersection of the\r\nhorizontal line, representing the evaporation per pound of fuel, with\r\nthe vertical line, representing the heat value per pound, the efficiency\r\nis read directly from the diagonal scale of efficiencies. This chart may\r\nalso be used for efficiency based upon combustible when the evaporation\r\nfrom and at 212 degrees and the heat values are both given in terms of\r\ncombustible.\r\n\r\n[Graph: Evaporation from and at 212° per Pound of Dry Fuel\r\nagainst B.T.U. per Pound of Dry Fuel\r\n\r\nFig. 39. Efficiency Chart. Calculated from Marks and Davis Tables\r\n\r\nDiagonal Lines Represent Per Cent Efficiency]\r\n\r\nBoiler efficiencies will vary over a wide range, depending on a great\r\nvariety of factors and conditions. The highest efficiencies that have\r\nbeen secured with coal are in the neighborhood of 82 per cent and from\r\nthat point efficiencies are found all the way down to below 50 per cent.\r\nTable 59[57] of tests of Babcock & Wilcox boilers under varying\r\nconditions of fuel and operation will give an idea of what may be\r\nobtained with proper operating conditions.\r\n\r\nThe difference between the efficiency secured in any boiler trial and\r\nthe perfect efficiency, 100 per cent, includes the losses, some of which\r\nare unavoidable in the present state of the art, arising in the\r\nconversion of the heat energy of the coal to the heat energy in the\r\nsteam. These losses may be classified as follows:\r\n\r\n1st. Loss due to fuel dropped through the grate.\r\n\r\n2nd. Loss due to unburned fuel which is carried by the draft, as small\r\nparticles, beyond the bridge wall into the setting or up the stack.\r\n\r\n3rd. Loss due to the utilization of a portion of the heat in heating the\r\nmoisture contained in the fuel from the temperature of the atmosphere to\r\n212 degrees; to evaporate it at that temperature and to superheat the\r\nsteam thus formed to the temperature of the flue gases. This steam, of\r\ncourse, is first heated to the temperature of the furnace but as it\r\ngives up a portion of this heat in passing through the boiler, the\r\nsuperheating to the temperature of the exit gases is the correct degree\r\nto be considered.\r\n\r\n4th. Loss due to the water formed and by the burning of the hydrogen in\r\nthe fuel which must be evaporated and superheated as in item 3.\r\n\r\n5th. Loss due to the superheating of the moisture in the air supplied\r\nfrom the atmospheric temperature to the temperature of the flue gases.\r\n\r\n6th. Loss due to the heating of the dry products of combustion to the\r\ntemperature of the flue gases.\r\n\r\n7th. Loss due to the incomplete combustion of the fuel when the carbon\r\nis not completely consumed but burns to CO instead of CO_{2}. The CO\r\npasses out of the stack unburned as a volatile gas capable of further\r\ncombustion.\r\n\r\n8th. Loss due to radiation of heat from the boiler and furnace settings.\r\n\r\nObviously a very elaborate test would have to be made were all of the\r\nabove items to be determined accurately. In ordinary practice it has\r\nbecome customary to summarize these losses as follows, the methods of\r\ncomputing the losses being given in each instance by a typical example:\r\n\r\n(A) Loss due to the heating of moisture in the fuel from the atmospheric\r\ntemperature to 212 degrees, evaporate it at that temperature and\r\nsuperheat it to the temperature of the flue gases. This in reality is\r\nthe total heat above the temperature of the air in the boiler room, in\r\none pound of superheated steam at atmospheric pressure at the\r\ntemperature of the flue gases, multiplied by the percentage of moisture\r\nin the fuel. As the total heat above the temperature of the air would\r\nhave to be computed in each instance, this loss is best expressed by:\r\n\r\nLoss in B. t. u. per pound = W(212-t+970.4+.47(T-212))      (33)\r\n\r\nWhere    W = per cent of moisture in coal,\r\n         t = the temperature of air in the boiler room,\r\n         T = temperature of the flue gases,\r\n       .47 = the specific heat of superheated steam at the atmospheric\r\n             pressure and at the flue gas temperature,\r\n   (212-t) = B. t. u. necessary to heat one pound of water from the\r\n             temperature of the boiler room to 212 degrees,\r\n     970.4 = B. t. u. necessary to evaporate one pound of water at 212\r\n             degrees to steam at atmospheric pressure,\r\n.47(T-212) = B. t. u. necessary to superheat one pound of steam at\r\n             atmospheric pressure from 212 degrees to temperature T.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Portion of 15,000 Horse-power Installation of Babcock &\r\nWilcox Boilers, Equipped with Babcock & Wilcox Chain Grate Stokers at\r\nthe Northumberland, Pa., Plant of the Atlas Portland Cement Co. This\r\nCompany Operates a Total of 24,000 Horse Power of Babcock & Wilcox\r\nBoilers in its Various Plants]\r\n\r\n(B) Loss due to heat carried away in the steam produced by the burning\r\nof the hydrogen component of the fuel. In burning, one pound of hydrogen\r\nunites with 8 pounds of oxygen to form 9 pounds of steam. Following the\r\nreasoning of item (A), therefore, this loss will be:\r\n\r\nLoss in B. t. u. per pound = 9H((212-t)+970.4+.47(T-212))      (34)\r\n\r\nwhere H = the percentage by weight of hydrogen.\r\n\r\nThis item is frequently considered as a part of the unaccounted for\r\nloss, where an ultimate analysis of the fuel is not given.\r\n\r\n(C) Loss due to heat carried away by dry chimney gases. This is\r\ndependent upon the weight of gas per pound of coal which may be\r\ndetermined by formula (16), page 158.\r\n\r\nLoss in B. t. u. per pound = (T-t)×.24×W.\r\n\r\nWhere T and t have values as in (33),\r\n\r\n.24 = specific heat of chimney gases,\r\n\r\n  W = weight of dry chimney gas per pound of coal.\r\n\r\n(D) Loss due to incomplete combustion of the carbon content of the fuel,\r\nthat is, the burning of the carbon to CO instead of CO_{2}.\r\n\r\n                               10,150 CO\r\nLoss in B. t. u. per pound = C×---------      (35)\r\n                               CO_{2}+CO\r\n\r\nC = per cent of carbon in coal by ultimate analysis,\r\n\r\nCO and CO_{2} = per cent of CO and CO_{2} by volume from flue gas\r\nanalysis.\r\n\r\n10,150 = the number of heat units generated by burning to CO_{2} one\r\npound of carbon contained in carbon monoxide.\r\n\r\n(E) Loss due to unconsumed carbon in the ash (it being usually assumed\r\nthat all the combustible in the ash is carbon).\r\n\r\nLoss in B. t. u. per pound =\r\nper cent C × per cent ash × B. t. u. per pound of combustible in the ash\r\n(usually taken as 14,600 B. t. u.)      (36)\r\n\r\nThe loss incurred in this way is, directly, the carbon in the ash in\r\npercentage terms of the total dry coal fired, multiplied by the heat\r\nvalue of carbon.\r\n\r\nTo compute this item, which is of great importance in comparing the\r\nrelative performances of different designs of grates, an analysis of the\r\nash must be available.\r\n\r\nThe other losses, namely, items 2, 5 and 8 of the first classification,\r\nare ordinarily grouped under one item, as unaccounted for losses, and\r\nare obviously the difference between 100 per cent and the sum of the\r\nheat utilized and the losses accounted for as given above. Item 5, or\r\nthe loss due to the moisture in the air, may be readily computed, the\r\nmoisture being determined from wet and dry bulb thermometer readings,\r\nbut it is usually disregarded as it is relatively small, averaging, say,\r\none-fifth to one-half of one per cent. Lack of data may, of course, make\r\nit necessary to include certain items of the second and ordinary\r\nclassification in this unaccounted for group.\r\n\r\n                        TABLE 57\r\n\r\n              DATA FROM WHICH HEAT BALANCE\r\n                 (TABLE 58) IS COMPUTED\r\n\r\n+------------------------------------------------------+\r\n|+----------------------------------------------------+|\r\n||Steam Pressure by Gauge, Pounds               | 192 ||\r\n||Temperature of Feed, Degrees Fahrenheit       | 180 ||\r\n||Degrees of Superheat, Degrees Fahrenheit      |115.2||\r\n||Temperature of Boiler Room, Degrees Fahrenheit|  81 ||\r\n||Temperature of Exit Gases, Degrees Fahrenheit | 480 ||\r\n||Weight of Coal Used per Hour, Pounds          | 5714||\r\n||Moisture, Per Cent                            | 1.83||\r\n||Dry Coal Per Hour, Pounds                     | 5609||\r\n||Ash and Refuse per Hour, Pounds               |  561||\r\n||Ash and Refuse (of Dry Coal), Per Cent        |10.00||\r\n||Actual Evaporation per Hour, Pounds           |57036||\r\n||           .- C, Per Cent                     |78.57||\r\n||           |  H, Per Cent                     | 5.60||\r\n||Ultimate   |  O, Per Cent                     | 7.02||\r\n||Analysis  -+  N, Per Cent                     | 1.11||\r\n||Dry Coal   |  Ash, Per Cent                   | 6.52||\r\n||           '- Sulphur, Per Cent               | 1.18||\r\n||Heat Value per Pound Dry Coal, B. t. u.       |14225||\r\n||Heat Value per Pound Combustible, B. t. u.    |15217||\r\n||Combustible in Ash by Analysis, Per Cent      | 17.9||\r\n||           .- CO_{2}, Per Cent                |14.33||\r\n||Flue Gas  -+  O, Per Cent                     | 4.54||\r\n||Analysis   |  CO, Per Cent                    | 0.11||\r\n||           '- N, Per Cent                     |81.02||\r\n|+----------------------------------------------+-----+|\r\n+------------------------------------------------------+\r\n\r\nA schedule of the losses as outlined, requires an evaporative test of\r\nthe boiler, an analysis of the flue gases, an ultimate analysis of the\r\nfuel, and either an ultimate or proximate analysis of the ash. As the\r\namount of unaccounted for losses forms a basis on which to judge the\r\naccuracy of a test, such a schedule is called a \"heat balance\".\r\n\r\nA heat balance is best illustrated by an example: Assume the data as\r\ngiven in Table 57 to be secured in an actual boiler test.\r\n\r\nFrom this data the factor of evaporation is 1.1514 and the evaporation\r\nper hour from and at 212 degrees is 65,671 pounds. Hence the evaporation\r\nfrom and at 212 degrees per pound of dry coal is 65,671÷5609 = 11.71\r\npounds. The efficiency of boiler, furnace and grate is:\r\n\r\n(11.71×970.4)÷14,225 = 79.88 per cent.\r\n\r\nThe heat losses are:\r\n\r\n(A) Loss due to moisture in coal,\r\n\r\n= .01831 ((212-81)+970.4+.47(480-212))\r\n= 22. B. t. u.,\r\n= 0.15 per cent.\r\n\r\n(B) The loss due to the burning of hydrogen:\r\n\r\n= 9×.0560((212-81)+970.4+.47(480-212))\r\n= 618 B. t. u.,\r\n= 4.34 per cent.\r\n\r\n(C) To compute the loss in the heat carried away by dry chimney gases\r\nper pound of coal the weight of such gases must be first determined.\r\nThis weight per pound of coal is:\r\n\r\n(11CO_{2}+8O+7(CO+N))\r\n(-------------------)C\r\n(    3(CO_{2}+CO)   )\r\n\r\nwhere CO_{2}, O, CO and H are the percentage by volume as determined by\r\nthe flue gas analysis and C is the percentage by weight of carbon in the\r\ndry fuel. Hence the weight of gas per pound of coal will be,\r\n\r\n(11×14.33+8×4.54+7(0.11+81.02))\r\n(-----------------------------)×78.57 = 13.7 pounds.\r\n(        3(14.33+0.11)        )\r\n\r\nTherefore the loss of heat in the dry gases carried up the chimney =\r\n\r\n13.7×0.24(480-81) = 1311 B. t. u.,\r\n                  = 9.22 per cent.\r\n\r\n(D) The loss due to incomplete combustion as evidenced by the presence\r\nof CO in the flue gas analysis is:\r\n\r\n   0.11\r\n----------×.7857×10,150 = 61.

The test showed 10.00 of the total\r\ndry fuel fired to be ash. Hence 10.00×.179 = 1.79 per cent of the total\r\nfuel represents the proportion of this total unconsumed in the ash and\r\nthe loss due to this cause is\r\n\r\n1.79 per cent × 14,600 = 261 B. t. u.,\r\n                       = 1.83 per cent.\r\n\r\nThe heat absorbed by the boilers per pound of dry fuel is 11.71×970.4 =\r\n11,363 B. t. u.

This is particularly true where the boiler performance\r\nhas been considered unsatisfactory. The distribution of the heat is thus\r\ndetermined and any extraordinary loss may be detected. Where accurate\r\ndata for computing such a heat balance is not available, such a\r\ncalculation based on certain assumptions is sometimes sufficient to\r\nindicate unusual losses.\r\n\r\nThe largest loss is ordinarily due to the chimney gases, which depends\r\ndirectly upon the weight of the gas and its temperature leaving the\r\nboiler. As pointed out in the chapter on flue gas analysis, the lower\r\nlimit of the weight of gas is fixed by the minimum air supplied with\r\nwhich complete combustion may be obtained. As shown, where this supply\r\nis unduly small, the loss caused by burning the carbon to CO instead of\r\nto CO_{2} more than offsets the gain in decreasing the weight of gas.\r\n\r\nThe lower limit of the stack temperature, as has been shown in the\r\nchapter on draft, is more or less fixed by the temperature necessary to\r\ncreate sufficient draft suction for good combustion. With natural draft,\r\nthis lower limit is probably between 400 and 450 degrees.\r\n\r\nCapacity--Before the capacity of a boiler is considered, it is necessary\r\nto define the basis to which such a term may be referred. Such a basis\r\nis the so-called boiler horse power.\r\n\r\nThe unit of motive power in general use among steam engineers is the\r\n\"horse power\" which is equivalent to 33,000 foot pounds per minute.\r\nStationary boilers are at the present time rated in horse power, though\r\nsuch a basis of rating may lead and has often led to a misunderstanding.\r\n_Work_, as the term is used in mechanics, is the overcoming of\r\nresistance through space, while _power_ is the _rate_ of work or the\r\namount done per unit of time. As the operation of a boiler in service\r\nimplies no motion, it can produce no power in the sense of the term as\r\nunderstood in mechanics. Its operation is the generation of steam, which\r\nacts as a medium to convey the energy of the fuel which is in the form\r\nof heat to a prime mover in which that heat energy is converted into\r\nenergy of motion or work, and power is developed.\r\n\r\nIf all engines developed the same amount of power from an equal amount\r\nof heat, a boiler might be designated as one having a definite horse\r\npower, dependent upon the amount of engine horse power its steam would\r\ndevelop. Such a statement of the rating of boilers, though it would\r\nstill be inaccurate, if the term is considered in its mechanical sense,\r\ncould, through custom, be interpreted to indicate that a boiler was of\r\nthe exact capacity required to generate the steam necessary to develop a\r\ndefinite amount of horse power in an engine. Such a basis of rating,\r\nhowever, is obviously impossible when the fact is considered that the\r\namount of steam necessary to produce the same power in prime movers of\r\ndifferent types and sizes varies over very wide limits.\r\n\r\nTo do away with the confusion resulting from an indefinite meaning of\r\nthe term boiler horse power, the Committee of Judges in charge of the\r\nboiler trials at the Centennial Exposition, 1876, at Philadelphia,\r\nascertained that a good engine of the type prevailing at the time\r\nrequired approximately 30 pounds of steam per hour per horse power\r\ndeveloped. In order to establish a relation between the engine power and\r\nthe size of a boiler required to develop that power, they recommended\r\nthat an evaporation of 30 pounds of water from an initial temperature of\r\n100 degrees Fahrenheit to steam at 70 pounds gauge pressure be\r\nconsidered as _one boiler horse power_. This recommendation has been\r\ngenerally accepted by American engineers as a standard, and when the\r\nterm boiler horse power is used in connection with stationary\r\nboilers[58] throughout this country,[59] without special definition, it\r\nis understood to have this meaning.\r\n\r\nInasmuch as an equivalent evaporation from and at 212 degrees Fahrenheit\r\nis the generally accepted basis of comparison[60], it is now customary\r\nto consider the standard boiler horse power as recommended by the\r\nCentennial Exposition Committee, in terms of equivalent evaporation from\r\nand at 212 degrees. This will be 30 pounds multiplied by the factor of\r\nevaporation for 70 pounds gauge pressure and 100 degrees feed\r\ntemperature, or 1.1494. 30 × 1.1494 = 34.482, or approximately 34.5\r\npounds. Hence, _one boiler horse power is equal to an evaporation of\r\n34.5 pounds of water per hour from and at 212 degrees Fahrenheit_. The\r\nterm boiler horse power, therefore, is clearly a measure of evaporation\r\nand not of power.\r\n\r\nA method of basing the horse power rating of a boiler adopted by boiler\r\nmanufacturers is that of heating surfaces. Such a method is absolutely\r\narbitrary and changes in no way the definition of a boiler horse power\r\njust given. It is simply a statement by the manufacturer that his\r\nproduct, under ordinary operating conditions or conditions which may be\r\nspecified, will evaporate 34.5 pounds of water from and at 212 degrees\r\nper definite amount of heating surface provided. The amount of heating\r\nsurface that has been considered by manufacturers capable of evaporating\r\n34.5 pounds from and at 212 degrees per hour has changed from time to\r\ntime as the art has progressed. At the present time 10 square feet of\r\nheating surface is ordinarily considered the equivalent of one boiler\r\nhorse power among manufacturers of stationary boilers. In view of the\r\narbitrary nature of such rating and of the widely varying rates of\r\nevaporation possible per square foot of heating surface with different\r\nboilers and different operating conditions, such a basis of rating has\r\nin reality no particular bearing on the question of horse power and\r\nshould be considered merely as a convenience.\r\n\r\nThe whole question of a unit of boiler capacity has been widely\r\ndiscussed with a view to the adoption of a standard to which there would\r\nappear to be a more rational and definite basis. Many suggestions have\r\nbeen offered as to such a basis but up to the present time there has\r\nbeen none which has met with universal approval or which would appear\r\nlikely to be generally adopted.\r\n\r\nWith the meaning of boiler horse power as given above, that is, a\r\nmeasure of evaporation, it is evident that the capacity of a boiler is a\r\nmeasure of the power it can develop expressed in boiler horse power.\r\nSince it is necessary, as stated, for boiler manufacturers to adopt a\r\nstandard for reasons of convenience in selling, the horse power for\r\nwhich a boiler is sold is known as its normal rated capacity.\r\n\r\nThe efficiency of a boiler and the maximum capacity it will develop can\r\nbe determined accurately only by a boiler test. The standard methods of\r\nconducting such tests are given on the following pages, these methods\r\nbeing the recommendations of the Power Test Committee of the American\r\nSociety of Mechanical Engineers brought out in 1913.[61] Certain changes\r\nhave been made to incorporate in the boiler code such portions of the\r\n\"Instructions Regarding Tests in General\" as apply to boiler testing.\r\nMethods of calculation and such matter as are treated in other portions\r\nof the book have been omitted from the code as noted.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Portion of 2600 Horse-power Installation of Babcock &\r\nWilcox Boilers, Equipped with Babcock & Wilcox Chain Grate Stokers at\r\nthe Peter Schoenhofen Brewing Co., Chicago, Ill.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1. OBJECT\r\n\r\n\r\nAscertain the specific object of the test, and keep this in view not\r\nonly in the work of preparation, but also during the progress of the\r\ntest, and do not let it be obscured by devoting too close attention to\r\nmatters of minor importance. Whatever the object of the test may be,\r\naccuracy and reliability must underlie the work from beginning to end.\r\n\r\nIf questions of fulfillment of contract are involved, there should be a\r\nclear understanding between all the parties, preferably in writing, as\r\nto the operating conditions which should obtain during the trial, and as\r\nto the methods of testing to be followed, unless these are already\r\nexpressed in the contract itself.\r\n\r\nAmong the many objects of performance tests, the following may be noted:\r\n\r\n    Determination of capacity and efficiency, and how these compare\r\n    with standard or guaranteed results.\r\n\r\n    Comparison of different conditions or methods of operation.\r\n\r\n    Determination of the cause of either inferior or superior\r\n    results.\r\n\r\n    Comparison of different kinds of fuel.\r\n\r\n    Determination of the effect of changes of design or proportion\r\n    upon capacity or efficiency, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2. PREPARATIONS\r\n\r\n\r\n_(A) Dimensions:_\r\n\r\nMeasure the dimensions of the principal parts of the apparatus to be\r\ntested, so far as they bear on the objects in view, or determine these\r\nfrom correct working drawings. Notice the general features of the same,\r\nboth exterior and interior, and make sketches, if needed, to show\r\nunusual points of design.\r\n\r\n    The dimensions of the heating surfaces of boilers and\r\n    superheaters to be found are those of surfaces in contact with\r\n    the fire or hot gases. The submerged surfaces in boilers at the\r\n    mean water level should be considered as water-heating surfaces,\r\n    and other surfaces which are exposed to the gases as\r\n    superheating surfaces.\r\n\r\n\r\n_(B) Examination of Plant:_\r\n\r\nMake a thorough examination of the physical condition of all parts of\r\nthe plant or apparatus which concern the object in view, and record the\r\nconditions found, together with any points in the matter of operation\r\nwhich bear thereon.\r\n\r\n    In boilers, examine for leakage of tubes and riveted or other\r\n    metal joints. Note the condition of brick furnaces, grates and\r\n    baffles. Examine brick walls and cleaning doors for air leaks,\r\n    either by shutting the damper and observing the escaping smoke\r\n    or by candle-flame test. Determine the condition of heating\r\n    surfaces with reference to exterior deposits of soot and\r\n    interior deposits of mud or scale.\r\n\r\n    See that the steam main is so arranged that condensed and\r\n    entrained water cannot flow back into the boiler.\r\n\r\nIf the object of the test is to determine the highest efficiency or\r\ncapacity obtainable, any physical defects, or defects of operation,\r\ntending to make the result unfavorable should first be remedied; all\r\nfoul parts being cleaned, and the whole put in first-class condition.\r\nIf, on the other hand, the object is to ascertain the performance under\r\nexisting conditions, no such preparation is either required or desired.\r\n\r\n\r\n_(C) General Precautions against Leakage:_\r\n\r\nIn steam tests make sure that there is no leakage through blow-offs,\r\ndrips, etc., or any steam or water connections of the plant or apparatus\r\nundergoing test, which would in any way affect the results. All such\r\nconnections should be blanked off, or satisfactory assurance should be\r\nobtained that there is leakage neither out nor in. This is a most\r\nimportant matter, and no assurance should be considered satisfactory\r\nunless it is susceptible of absolute demonstration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3. FUEL\r\n\r\n\r\nDetermine the character of fuel to be used.[62] For tests of maximum\r\nefficiency or capacity of the boiler to compare with other boilers, the\r\ncoal should be of some kind which is commercially regarded as a standard\r\nfor the locality where the test is made.\r\n\r\n    In the Eastern States the standards thus regarded for\r\n    semi-bituminous coals are Pocahontas (Va. and W. Va.) and New\r\n    River (W. Va.); for anthracite coals those of the No. 1\r\n    buckwheat size, fresh-mined, containing not over 13 per cent ash\r\n    by analysis; and for bituminous coals, Youghiogheny and\r\n    Pittsburgh coals. In some sections east of the Allegheny\r\n    Mountains the semi-bituminous Clearfield (Pa.) and Cumberland\r\n    (Md.) are also considered as standards. These coals when of good\r\n    quality possess the essentials of excellence, adaptability to\r\n    various kinds of furnaces, grates, boilers, and methods of\r\n    firing required, besides being widely distributed and generally\r\n    accessible in the Eastern market. There are no special grades of\r\n    coal mined in the Western States which are widely and generally\r\n    considered as standards for testing purposes; the best coal\r\n    obtainable in any particular locality being regarded as the\r\n    standard of comparison.\r\n\r\nA coal selected for maximum efficiency and capacity tests, should be the\r\nbest of its class, and especially free from slagging and unusual\r\nclinker-forming impurities.\r\n\r\nFor guarantee and other tests with a specified coal containing not more\r\nthan a certain amount of ash and moisture, the coal selected should not\r\nbe higher in ash and in moisture than the stated amounts, because any\r\nincrease is liable to reduce the efficiency and capacity more than the\r\nequivalent proportion of such increase.\r\n\r\nThe size of the coal, especially where it is of the anthracite class,\r\nshould be determined by screening a suitable sample.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4. APPARATUS AND INSTRUMENTS[63]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe apparatus and instruments required for boiler tests are:\r\n\r\n    (A) Platform scales for weighing coal and ashes.\r\n\r\n    (B) Graduated scales attached to the water glasses.\r\n\r\n    (C) Tanks and platform scales for weighing water (or water\r\n    meters calibrated in place). Wherever practicable the feed water\r\n    should be weighed, especially for guarantee tests. The most\r\n    satisfactory and reliable apparatus for this purpose consists of\r\n    one or more tanks each placed on platform scales, these being\r\n    elevated a sufficient distance above the floor to empty into a\r\n    receiving tank placed below, the latter being connected to the\r\n    feed pump. Where only one weighing tank is used the receiving\r\n    tank should be of larger size than the weighing tank, to afford\r\n    sufficient reserve supply to the pump while the upper tank is\r\n    filling. If a single weighing tank is used it should preferably\r\n    be of such capacity as to require emptying not oftener than\r\n    every 5 minutes. If two or more are used the intervals between\r\n    successive emptyings should not be less than 3 minutes.\r\n\r\n    (D) Pressure gauges, thermometers, and draft gauges.\r\n\r\n    (E) Calorimeters for determining the calorific value of fuel and\r\n    the quality of steam.\r\n\r\n    (F) Furnaces pyrometers.\r\n\r\n    (G) Gas analyzing apparatus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5. OPERATING CONDITIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nDetermine what the operating conditions and method of firing should be\r\nto conform to the object in view, and see that they prevail throughout\r\nthe trial, as nearly as possible.\r\n\r\n    Where uniformity in the rate of evaporation is required,\r\n    arrangement can be usually made to dispose of the steam so that\r\n    this result can be attained. In a single boiler it may be\r\n    accomplished by discharging steam through a waste pipe and\r\n    regulating the amount by means of a valve. In a battery of\r\n    boilers, in which only one is tested, the draft may be regulated\r\n    on the remaining boilers to meet the varying demands for steam,\r\n    leaving the test boiler to work under a steady rate of\r\n    evaporation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6. DURATION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe duration of tests to determine the efficiency of a hand-fired\r\nboiler, should be 10 hours of continuous running, or such time as may be\r\nrequired to burn a total of 250 pounds of coal per square foot of grate.\r\n\r\nIn the case of a boiler using a mechanical stoker, the duration, where\r\npracticable, should be at least 24 hours. If the stoker is of a type\r\nthat permits the quantity and condition of the fuel bed at beginning and\r\nend of the test to be accurately estimated, the duration may be reduced\r\nto 10 hours, or such time as may be required to burn the above noted\r\ntotal of 250 pounds per square foot.\r\n\r\n    In commercial tests where the service requires continuous\r\n    operation night and day, with frequent shifts of firemen, the\r\n    duration of the test, whether the boilers are hand fired or\r\n    stoker fired, should be at least 24 hours. Likewise in\r\n    commercial tests, either of a single boiler or of a plant of\r\n    several boilers, which operate regularly a certain number of\r\n    hours and during the balance of the day the fires are banked,\r\n    the duration should not be less than 24 hours.\r\n\r\n    The duration of tests to determine the maximum evaporative\r\n    capacity of a boiler, without determining the efficiency, should\r\n    not be less than 3 hours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7. STARTING AND STOPPING\r\n\r\n\r\nThe conditions regarding the temperature of the furnace and boiler, the\r\nquantity and quality of the live coal and ash on the grates, the water\r\nlevel, and the steam pressure, should be as nearly as possible the same\r\nat the end as at the beginning of the test.\r\n\r\nTo secure the desired equality of conditions with hand-fired boilers,\r\nthe following method should be employed:\r\n\r\n    The furnace being well heated by a preliminary run, burn the\r\n    fire low, and thoroughly clean it, leaving enough live coal\r\n    spread evenly over the grate (say 2 to 4 inches),[64] to serve\r\n    as a foundation for the new fire. Note quickly the thickness of\r\n    the coal bed as nearly as it can be estimated or measured; also\r\n    the water level,[65] the steam pressure, and the time, and\r\n    record the latter as the starting time. Fresh coal should then\r\n    be fired from that weighed for the test, the ashpit throughly\r\n    cleaned, and the regular work of the test proceeded with. Before\r\n    the end of the test the fire should again be burned low and\r\n    cleaned in such a manner as to leave the same amount of live\r\n    coal on the grate as at the start. When this condition is\r\n    reached, observe quickly the water level,[65] the steam\r\n    pressure, and the time, and record the latter as the stopping\r\n    time. If the water level is not the same as at the beginning a\r\n    correction should be made by computation, rather than by feeding\r\n    additional water after the final readings are taken. Finally\r\n    remove the ashes and refuse from the ashpit. In a plant\r\n    containing several boilers where it is not practicable to clean\r\n    them simultaneously, the fires should be cleaned one after the\r\n    other as rapidly as may be, and each one after cleaning charged\r\n    with enough coal to maintain a thin fire in good working\r\n    condition. After the last fire is cleaned and in working\r\n    condition, burn all the fires low (say 4 to 6 inches), note\r\n    quickly the thickness of each, also the water levels, steam\r\n    pressure, and time, which last is taken as the starting time.\r\n    Likewise when the time arrives for closing the test, the fires\r\n    should be quickly cleaned one by one, and when this work is\r\n    completed they should all be burned low the same as the start,\r\n    and the various observations made as noted. In the case of a\r\n    large boiler having several furnace doors requiring the fire to\r\n    be cleaned in sections one after the other, the above directions\r\n    pertaining to starting and stopping in a plant of several\r\n    boilers may be followed.\r\n\r\nTo obtain the desired equality of conditions of the fire when a\r\nmechanical stoker other than a chain grate is used, the procedure should\r\nbe modified where practicable as follows:\r\n\r\n    Regulate the coal feed so as to burn the fire to the low\r\n    condition required for cleaning. Shut off the coal-feeding\r\n    mechanism and fill the hoppers level full. Clean the ash or dump\r\n    plate, note quickly the depth and condition of the coal on the\r\n    grate, the water level,[66] the steam pressure, and the time,\r\n    and record the latter as the starting time. Then start the\r\n    coal-feeding mechanism, clean the ashpit, and proceed with the\r\n    regular work of the test.\r\n\r\n    When the time arrives for the close of the test, shut off the\r\n    coal-feeding mechanism, fill the hoppers and burn the fire to\r\n    the same low point as at the beginning. When this condition is\r\n    reached, note the water level, the steam pressure, and the time,\r\n    and record the latter as the stopping time. Finally clean the\r\n    ashplate and haul the ashes.\r\n\r\n    In the case of chain grate stokers, the desired operating\r\n    conditions should be maintained for half an hour before starting\r\n    a test and for a like period before its close, the height of the\r\n    throat plate and the speed of the grate being the same during\r\n    both of these periods.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8. RECORDS\r\n\r\n\r\nA log of the data should be entered in notebooks or on blank sheets\r\nsuitably prepared in advance. This should be done in such manner that\r\nthe test may be divided into hourly periods, or if necessary, periods of\r\nless duration, and the leading data obtained for any one or more periods\r\nas desired, thereby showing the degree of uniformity obtained.\r\n\r\nHalf-hourly readings of the instruments are usually sufficient. If there\r\nare sudden and wide fluctuations, the readings in such cases should be\r\ntaken every 15 minutes, and in some instances oftener.\r\n\r\n    The coal should be weighed and delivered to the firemen in\r\n    portions sufficient for one hour's run, thereby ascertaining the\r\n    degree of uniformity of firing. An ample supply of coal should\r\n    be maintained at all times, but the quantity on the floor at the\r\n    end of each hour should be as small as practicable, so that the\r\n    same may be readily estimated and deducted from the total\r\n    weight.\r\n\r\n    The records should be such as to ascertain also the consumption\r\n    of feed water each hour and thereby determine the degree of\r\n    uniformity of evaporation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n9. QUALITY OF STEAM[67]\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the boiler does not produce superheated steam the percentage of\r\nmoisture in the steam should be determined by the use of a throttling or\r\nseparating calorimeter. If the boiler has superheating surface, the\r\ntemperature of the steam should be determined by the use of a\r\nthermometer inserted in a thermometer well.\r\n\r\nFor saturated steam construct a sampling pipe or nozzle made of one-half\r\ninch iron pipe and insert it in the steam main at a point where the\r\nentrained moisture is likely to be most thoroughly mixed. The inner end\r\nof the pipe, which should extend nearly across to the opposite side of\r\nthe main, should be closed and interior portion perforated with not less\r\nthan twenty one-eighth inch holes equally distributed from end to end\r\nand preferably drilled in irregular or spiral rows, with the first hole\r\nnot less than half an inch from the wall of the pipe.\r\n\r\n    The sampling pipe should not be placed near a point where water\r\n    may pocket or where such water may effect the amount of moisture\r\n    contained in the sample. Where non-return valves are used, or\r\n    there are horizontal connections leading from the boiler to a\r\n    vertical outlet, water may collect at the lower end of the\r\n    uptake pipe and be blown upward in a spray which will not be\r\n    carried away by the steam owing to a lack of velocity. A sample\r\n    taken from the lower part of this pipe will show a greater\r\n    amount of moisture than a true sample. With goose-neck\r\n    connections a small amount of water may collect on the bottom of\r\n    the pipe near the upper end where the inclination is such that\r\n    the tendency to flow backward is ordinarily counterbalanced by\r\n    the flow of steam forward over its surface; but when the\r\n    velocity momentarily decreases the water flows back to the lower\r\n    end of the goose-neck and increases the moisture at that point,\r\n    making it an undesirable location for sampling. In any case it\r\n    must be borne in mind that with low velocities the tendency is\r\n    for drops of entrained water to settle to the bottom of the\r\n    pipe, and to be temporarily broken up into spray whenever an\r\n    abrupt bend or other disturbance is met.\r\n\r\nIf it is necessary to attach the sampling nozzle at a point near the end\r\nof a long horizontal run, a drip pipe should be provided a short\r\ndistance in front of the nozzle, preferably at a pocket formed by some\r\nfitting and the water running along the bottom of the main drawn off,\r\nweighed, and added to the moisture shown by the calorimeter; or, better,\r\na steam separator should be installed at the point noted.\r\n\r\nIn testing a stationary boiler the sampling pipe should be located as\r\nnear as practicable to the boiler, and the same is true as regards the\r\nthermometer well when the steam is superheated. In an engine or turbine\r\ntest these locations should be as near as practicable to throttle valve.\r\nIn the test of a plant where it is desired to get complete information,\r\nespecially where the steam main is unusually long, sampling nozzles or\r\nthermometer wells should be provided at both points, so as to obtain\r\ndata at either point as may be required.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n10. SAMPLING AND DRYING COAL\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the progress of test the coal should be regularly sampled for the\r\npurpose of analysis and determination of moisture.\r\n\r\nSelect a representative shovelful from each barrow-load as it is drawn\r\nfrom the coal pile or other source of supply, and store the samples in a\r\ncool place in a covered metal receptacle. When all the coal has thus\r\nbeen sampled, break up the lumps, thoroughly mix the whole quantity, and\r\nfinally reduce it by the process of repeated quartering and crushing to\r\na sample weighing about 5 pounds, the largest pieces being about the\r\nsize of a pea. From this sample two one-quart air-tight glass fruit\r\njars, or other air-tight vessels, are to be promptly filled and\r\npreserved for subsequent determinations of moisture, calorific value,\r\nand chemical composition. These operations should be conducted where the\r\nair is cool and free from drafts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 3460 Horse-power Installation of Babcock & Wilcox Boilers\r\nat the Chicago, Ill., Shops of the Chicago and Northwestern Ry. Co.]\r\n\r\nWhen the sample lot of coal has been reduced by quartering to, say, 100\r\npounds, a portion weighing, say, 15 to 20 pounds should be withdrawn for\r\nthe purpose of immediate moisture determination. This is placed in a\r\nshallow iron pan and dried on the hot iron boiler flue for at least 12\r\nhours, being weighed before and after drying on scales reading to\r\nquarter ounces.\r\n\r\nThe moisture thus determined is approximately reliable for anthracite\r\nand semi-bituminous coals, but not for coals containing much inherent\r\nmoisture. For such coals, and for all absolutely reliable determinations\r\nthe method to be pursued is as follows:\r\n\r\n    Take one of the samples contained in the glass jars, and subject\r\n    it to a thorough air drying, by spreading it in a thin layer and\r\n    exposing it for several hours to the atmosphere of a warm room,\r\n    weighing it before and after, thereby determining the quantity\r\n    of surface moisture it contains.[68] Then crush the whole of it\r\n    by running it through an ordinary coffee mill or other suitable\r\n    crusher adjusted so as to produce somewhat coarse grains (less\r\n    than 1/16 inch), thoroughly mix the crushed sample, select from\r\n    it a portion of from 10 to 50 grams,[69] weigh it in a balance\r\n    which will easily show a variation as small as 1 part in 1000,\r\n    and dry it for one hour in an air or sand bath at a temperature\r\n    between 240 and 280 degrees Fahrenheit. Weigh it and record the\r\n    loss, then heat and weigh again until the minimum weight has\r\n    been reached. The difference between the original and the\r\n    minimum weight is the moisture in the air-dried coal. The sum of\r\n    the moisture thus found and that of the surface moisture is the\r\n    total moisture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n11. ASHES AND REFUSE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ashes and refuse withdrawn from the furnace and ashpit during the\r\nprogress of the test and at its close should be weighed so far as\r\npossible in a dry state. If wet the amount of moisture should be\r\nascertained and allowed for, a sample being taken and dried for this\r\npurpose. This sample may serve also for analysis and the determination\r\nof unburned carbon and fusing temperature.\r\n\r\nThe method above described for sampling coal may also be followed for\r\nobtaining a sample of the ashes and refuse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n12. CALORIFIC TESTS AND ANALYSES OF COAL\r\n\r\n\r\nThe quality of the fuel should be determined by calorific tests and\r\nanalysis of the coal sample above referred to.[70]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n13. ANALYSES OF FLUE GASES\r\n\r\n\r\nFor approximate determinations of the composition of the flue gases, the\r\nOrsat apparatus, or some modification thereof, should be employed. If\r\nmomentary samples are obtained the analyses should be made as frequently\r\nas possible, say, every 15 to 30 minutes, depending on the skill of the\r\noperator, noting at the time the sample is drawn the furnace and firing\r\nconditions. If the sample drawn is a continuous one, the intervals may\r\nbe made longer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n14. SMOKE OBSERVATIONS[71]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn tests of bituminous coals requiring a determination of the amount of\r\nsmoke produced, observations should be made regularly throughout the\r\ntrial at intervals of 5 minutes (or if necessary every minute), noting\r\nat the same time the furnace and firing conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n15. CALCULATION OF RESULTS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe methods to be followed in expressing and calculating those results\r\nwhich are not self-evident are explained as follows:\r\n\r\n    (A) _Efficiency._ The \"efficiency of boiler, furnace and\r\n    grate\" is the relation between the heat absorbed per pound of\r\n    coal fired, and the calorific value of one pound of coal.\r\n\r\n    The \"efficiency of boiler and furnace\" is the relation between\r\n    the heat absorbed per pound of combustible burned, and the\r\n    calorific value of one pound of combustible. This expression of\r\n    efficiency furnishes a means for comparing one boiler and\r\n    furnace with another, when the losses of unburned coal due to\r\n    grates, cleanings, etc., are eliminated.\r\n\r\n    The \"combustible burned\" is determined by subtracting from the\r\n    weight of coal supplied to the boiler, the moisture in the coal,\r\n    the weight of ash and unburned coal withdrawn from the furnace\r\n    and ashpit, and the weight of dust, soot, and refuse, if any,\r\n    withdrawn from the tubes, flues, and combustion chambers,\r\n    including ash carried away in the gases, if any, determined from\r\n    the analysis of coal and ash. The \"combustible\" used for\r\n    determining the calorific value is the weight of coal less the\r\n    moisture and ash found by analysis.\r\n\r\n    The \"heat absorbed\" per pound of coal, or combustible, is\r\n    calculated by multiplying the equivalent evaporation from and at\r\n    212 degrees per pound of coal or combustible by 970.4.\r\n\r\nOther items in this section which have been treated elsewhere are:\r\n\r\n    (B) Corrections for moisture in steam.\r\n\r\n    (C) Correction for live steam used.\r\n\r\n    (D) Equivalent evaporation.\r\n\r\n    (E) Heat balance.\r\n\r\n    (F) Total heat of combustion of coal.\r\n\r\n    (G) Air for combustion and the methods recommended for\r\n    calculating these results are in accordance with those described\r\n    in different portions of this book.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n16. DATA AND RESULTS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe data and results should be reported in accordance with either the\r\nshort form or the complete form, adding lines for data not provided for,\r\nor omitting those not required, as may conform to the object in view.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n17. CHART\r\n\r\n\r\nIn trials having for an object the determination and exposition of the\r\ncomplete boiler performance, the entire log of readings and data should\r\nbe plotted on a chart and represented graphically.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n18. TESTS WITH OIL AND GAS FUELS\r\n\r\n\r\nTests of boilers using oil or gas for fuel should accord with the rules\r\nhere given, excepting as they are varied to conform to the particular\r\ncharacteristics of the fuel. The duration in such cases may be reduced,\r\nand the \"flying\" method of starting and stopping employed.\r\n\r\n    The table of data and results should contain items stating\r\n    character of furnace and burner, quality and composition of oil\r\n    or gas, temperature of oil, pressure of steam used for\r\n    vaporizing and quantity of steam used for both vaporizing and\r\n    for heating.\r\n\r\n              TABLE DATA AND RESULTS OF EVAPORATIVE TEST\r\n                       SHORT FORM, CODE OF 1912\r\n\r\n 1 Test of.................boiler located at................................\r\n       to determine...............conducted by..............................\r\n 2 Kind of furnace..........................................................\r\n 3 Grate surface.................................................square feet\r\n 4 Water-heating surface.........................................square feet\r\n 5 Superheating surface..........................................square feet\r\n 6 Date.....................................................................\r\n 7 Duration............................................................hours\r\n 8 Kind and size of coal....................................................\r\n\r\nAVERAGE PRESSURES, TEMPERATURES, ETC.\r\n\r\n 9 Steam pressure by gauge............................................pounds\r\n10 Temperature of feed water entering boiler.........................degrees\r\n11 Temperature of escaping gases leaving boiler......................degrees\r\n12 Force of draft between damper and boiler...........................inches\r\n13 Percentage of moisture in steam,\r\n      or number degrees of superheating..................per cent or degrees\r\n\r\nTOTAL QUANTITIES\r\n\r\n14 Weight of coal as fired[72]........................................pounds\r\n15 Percentage of moisture in coal...................................per cent\r\n16 Total weight of dry coal consumed..................................pounds\r\n17 Total ash and refuse...............................................pounds\r\n18 Percentage of ash and refuse in dry coal.........................per cent\r\n19 Total weight of water fed to the boiler[73]........................pounds\r\n20 Total water evaporated, corrected for moisture in steam............pounds\r\n21 Total equivalent evaporation from and at 212 degrees...............pounds\r\n\r\nHOURLY QUANTITIES AND RATES\r\n\r\n22 Dry coal consumed per hour.........................................pounds\r\n23 Dry coal per square feet of grate surface per hour.................pounds\r\n24 Water evaporated per hour corrected for quality of steam...........pounds\r\n25 Equivalent evaporation per hour from and at 212 degrees............pounds\r\n26 Equivalent evaporation per hour from and at 212 degrees\r\n      per square foot of water-heating surface........................pounds\r\n\r\nCAPACITY\r\n\r\n27 Evaporation per hour from and at 212 degrees (same as Line 25).....pounds\r\n28 Boiler horse power developed (Item 27÷34½).............boiler horse power\r\n29 Rated capacity, in evaporation from and at 212 degrees per hour....pounds\r\n30 Rated boiler horse power...............................boiler horse power\r\n31 Percentage of rated capacity developed...........................per cent\r\n\r\nECONOMY RESULTS\r\n\r\n32 Water fed per pound of coal fired (Item 19÷Item 14)................pounds\r\n33 Water evaporated per pound of dry coal (Item 20÷Item 16)...........pounds\r\n34 Equivalent evaporation from and at 212 degrees per pound\r\n      of dry coal (Item 21÷Item 16)...................................pounds\r\n35 Equivalent evaporation from and at 212 degrees per pound\r\n      of combustible [Item 21÷(Item 16-Item 17)]......................pounds\r\n\r\nEFFICIENCY\r\n\r\n36 Calorific value of one pound of dry coal.........................B. t. u.\r\n37 Calorific value of one pound of combustible......................B. t. u.\r\n\r\n                                           (      Item 34×970.4)\r\n38 Efficiency of boiler, furnace and grate (100 × -------------)....per cent\r\n                                           (         Item 36   )\r\n\r\n                                    (      Item 35×970.4)\r\n39 Efficiency of boiler and furnace (100 × -------------)...........per cent\r\n                                    (         Item 37   )\r\n\r\nCOST OF EVAPORATION\r\n\r\n40 Cost of coal per ton of......pounds delivered in boiler room......dollars\r\n41 Cost of coal required for evaporating 1000 pounds of water\r\n      from and at 212 degrees........................................dollars\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Portion of 3600 Horse-power Installation of Babcock &\r\nWilcox Boilers, Equipped with Babcock & Wilcox Chain Grate Stokers at\r\nthe Loomis Street Plant of the Peoples Gas Light & Coke Co., Chicago,\r\nIll. This Company has Installed 7780 Horse Power of Babcock & Wilcox\r\nBoilers]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SELECTION OF BOILERS WITH A CONSIDERATION OF THE FACTORS DETERMINING\r\nSUCH SELECTION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe selection of steam boilers is a matter to which the most careful\r\nthought and attention may be well given. Within the last twenty years,\r\nradical changes have taken place in the methods and appliances for the\r\ngeneration and distribution of power. These changes have been made\r\nlargely in the prime movers, both as to type and size, and are best\r\nillustrated by the changes in central station power-plant practice. It\r\nis hardly within the scope of this work to treat of power-plant design\r\nand the discussion will be limited to a consideration of the boiler end\r\nof the power plant.\r\n\r\nAs stated, the changes have been largely in prime movers, the steam\r\ngenerating equipment having been considered more or less of a standard\r\npiece of apparatus whose sole function is the transfer of the heat\r\nliberated from the fuel by combustion to the steam stored or circulated\r\nin such apparatus. When the fact is considered that the cost of steam\r\ngeneration is roughly from 65 to 80 per cent of the total cost of power\r\nproduction, it may be readily understood that the most fruitful field\r\nfor improvement exists in the boiler end of the power plant. The\r\nefficiency of the plant as a whole will vary with the load it carries\r\nand it is in the boiler room where such variation is largest and most\r\nsubject to control.\r\n\r\nThe improvements to be secured in the boiler room results are not simply\r\na matter of dictation of operating methods. The securing of perfect\r\ncombustion, with the accompanying efficiency of heat transfer, while\r\ncomparatively simple in theory, is difficult to obtain in practical\r\noperation. This fact is perhaps best exemplified by the difference\r\nbetween test results and those obtained in daily operation even under\r\nthe most careful supervision. This difference makes it necessary to\r\nestablish a standard by which operating results may be judged, a\r\nstandard not necessarily that which might be possible under test\r\nconditions but one which experiment shows can be secured under the very\r\nbest operating conditions.\r\n\r\nThe study of the theory of combustion, draft, etc., as already given,\r\nwill indicate that the question of efficiency is largely a matter of\r\nproper relation between fuel, furnace and generator. While the\r\npossibility of a substantial saving through added efficiency cannot be\r\noverlooked, the boiler design of the future must, even more than in the\r\npast, be considered particularly from the aspect of reliability and\r\nsimplicity. A flexibility of operation is necessary as a guarantee of\r\ncontinuity of service.\r\n\r\nIn view of the above, before the question of the selection of boilers\r\ncan be taken up intelligently, it is necessary to consider the subjects\r\nof boiler efficiency and boiler capacity, together with their relation\r\nto each other.\r\n\r\nThe criterion by which the efficiency of a boiler plant is to be judged\r\nis the cost of the production of a definite amount of steam. Considered\r\nin this sense, there must be included in the efficiency of a boiler\r\nplant the simplicity of operation, flexibility and reliability of the\r\nboiler used. The items of repair and upkeep cost are often high because\r\nof the nature of the service. The governing factor in these items is\r\nunquestionably the type of boiler selected.\r\n\r\nThe features entering into the plant efficiency are so numerous that it\r\nis impossible to make a statement as to a means of securing the highest\r\nefficiency which will apply to all cases. Such efficiency is to be\r\nsecured by the proper relation of fuel, furnace and boiler heating\r\nsurface, actual operating conditions, which allow the approaching of the\r\npotential efficiencies made possible by the refinement of design, and a\r\nsystematic supervision of the operation assisted by a detailed record of\r\nperformances and conditions. The question of supervision will be taken\r\nup later in the chapter on \"Operation and Care of Boilers\".\r\n\r\nThe efficiencies that may be expected from the combination of\r\nwell-designed boilers and furnaces are indicated in Table 59 in which\r\nare given a number of tests with various fuels and under widely\r\ndifferent operating conditions.\r\n\r\nIt is to be appreciated that the results obtained as given in this table\r\nare practically all under test conditions. The nearness with which\r\npractical operating conditions can approach these figures will depend\r\nupon the character of the supervision of the boiler room and the\r\nintelligence of the operating crew. The size of the plant will\r\nordinarily govern the expense warranted in securing the right sort of\r\nsupervision.\r\n\r\nThe bearing that the type of boiler has on the efficiency to be expected\r\ncan only be realized from a study of the foregoing chapters.\r\n\r\nCapacity--Capacity, as already defined, is the ability of a definite\r\namount of boiler-heating surface to generate steam. Boilers are\r\nordinarily purchased under a manufacturer's specification, which rates a\r\nboiler at a nominal rated horse power, usually based on 10 square feet\r\nof heating surface per horse power. Such a builders' rating is\r\nabsolutely arbitrary and implies nothing as to the limiting amount of\r\nwater that this amount of heating surface will evaporate. It does not\r\nimply that the evaporation of 34.5 pounds of water from and at 212\r\ndegrees with 10 square feet of heating surface is the limit of the\r\ncapacity of the boiler. Further, from a statement that a boiler is of a\r\ncertain horse power on the manufacturer's basis, it is not to be\r\nunderstood that the boiler is in any state of strain when developing\r\nmore than its rated capacity.\r\n\r\nBroadly stated, the evaporative capacity of a certain amount of heating\r\nsurface in a well-designed boiler, that is, the boiler horse power it is\r\ncapable of producing, is limited only by the amount of fuel that can be\r\nburned under the boiler. While such a statement would imply that the\r\nquestion of capacity to be secured was simply one of making an\r\narrangement by which sufficient fuel could be burned under a definite\r\namount of heating surface to generate the required amount of steam,\r\nthere are limiting features that must be weighed against the advantages\r\nof high capacity developed from small heating surfaces. Briefly stated,\r\nthese factors are as follows:\r\n\r\n1st. Efficiency. As the capacity increases, there will in general be a\r\ndecrease in efficiency, this loss above a certain point making it\r\ninadvisable to try to secure more than a definite horse power from a\r\ngiven boiler. This loss of efficiency with increased capacity is treated\r\nbelow in detail, in considering the relation of efficiency to capacity.\r\n\r\n2nd. Grate Ratio Possible or Practicable. All fuels have a maximum rate\r\nof combustion, beyond which satisfactory results cannot be obtained,\r\nregardless of draft available or which may be secured by mechanical\r\nmeans. Such being the case, it is evident that with this maximum\r\ncombustion rate secured, the only method of obtaining added capacity\r\nwill be through the addition of grate surface. There is obviously a\r\npoint beyond which the grate surface for a given boiler cannot be\r\nincreased. This is due to the impracticability of handling grates above\r\na certain maximum size, to the enormous loss in draft pressure through a\r\nboiler resulting from an attempt to force an abnormal quantity of gas\r\nthrough the heating surface and to innumerable details of design and\r\nmaintenance that would make such an arrangement wholly unfeasible.\r\n\r\n3rd. Feed Water. The difficulties that may arise through the use of poor\r\nfeed water or that are liable to happen through the use of practically\r\nany feed water have already been pointed out. This question of feed is\r\nfrequently the limiting factor in the capacity obtainable, for with an\r\nincrease in such capacity comes an added concentration of such\r\ningredients in the feed water as will cause priming, foaming or rapid\r\nscale formation. Certain waters which will give no trouble that cannot\r\nbe readily overcome with the boiler run at ordinary ratings will cause\r\ndifficulties at higher ratings entirely out of proportion to any\r\nadvantage secured by an increase in the power that a definite amount of\r\nheating surface may be made to produce.\r\n\r\nWhere capacity in the sense of overload is desired, the type of boiler\r\nselected will play a large part in the successful operation through such\r\nperiods. A boiler must be selected with which there is possible a\r\nfurnace arrangement that will give flexibility without undue loss in\r\nefficiency over the range of capacity desired. The heating surface must\r\nbe so arranged that it will be possible to install in a practical\r\nmanner, sufficient grate surface at or below the maximum combustion rate\r\nto develop the amount of power required. The design of boiler must be\r\nsuch that there will be no priming or foaming at high overloads and that\r\nany added scale formation due to such overloads may be easily removed.\r\nCertain boilers which deliver commercially dry steam when operated at\r\nabout their normal rated capacity will prime badly when run at overloads\r\nand this action may take place with a water that should be easily\r\nhandled by a properly designed boiler at any reasonable load. Such\r\naction is ordinarily produced by the lack of a well defined, positive\r\ncirculation.\r\n\r\nRelation of Efficiency and Capacity--The statement has been made that in\r\ngeneral the efficiency of a boiler will decrease as the capacity is\r\nincreased. Considering the boiler alone, apart from the furnace, this\r\nstatement may be readily explained.\r\n\r\nPresupposing a constant furnace temperature, regardless of the capacity\r\nat which a given boiler is run; to assure equal efficiencies at low and\r\nhigh ratings, the exit temperature in the two instances would\r\nnecessarily be the same. For this temperature at the high rating, to be\r\nidentical with that at the low rating, the rate of heat transfer from\r\nthe gases to the heating surfaces would have to vary directly as the\r\nweight or volume of such gases. Experiment has shown, however, that this\r\nis not true but that this rate of transfer varies as some power of the\r\nvolume of gas less than one. As the heat transfer does not, therefore,\r\nincrease proportionately with the volume of gases, the exit temperature\r\nfor a given furnace temperature will be increased as the volume of gases\r\nincreases. As this is the measure of the efficiency of the heating\r\nsurface, the boiler efficiency will, therefore, decrease as the volume\r\nof gases increases or the capacity at which the boiler is operated\r\nincreases.\r\n\r\nFurther, a certain portion of the heat absorbed by the heating surface\r\nis through direct radiation from the fire. Again, presupposing a\r\nconstant furnace temperature; the heat absorbed through radiation is\r\nsolely a function of the amount of surface exposed to such radiation.\r\nHence, for the conditions assumed, the amount of heat absorbed by\r\nradiation at the higher ratings will be the same as at the lower ratings\r\nbut in proportion to the total absorption will be less. As the added\r\nvolume of gas does not increase the rate of heat transfer, there are\r\ntherefore two factors acting toward the decrease in the efficiency of a\r\nboiler with an increase in the capacity.\r\n\r\n                                TABLE 59\r\n\r\n          TESTS OF BABCOCK & WILCOX BOILERS WITH VARIOUS FUELS\r\n\r\n ______________________________________________________________________\r\n|Number|                           |                |         | Rated  |\r\n|  of  |     Name and Location     |  Kind of Coal  | Kind of | Horse  |\r\n| Test |         of Plant          |                | Furnace |Power of|\r\n|      |                           |                |         | Boiler |\r\n|      |                           |                |         |        |\r\n|______|___________________________|________________|_________|________|\r\n|      |Susquehanna Coal Co.,      |No. 1 Anthracite|Hand     |        |\r\n|   1  |Shenandoah, Pa.            |Buckwheat       |Fired    |   300  |\r\n|______|___________________________|________________|_________|________|\r\n|      |Balbach Smelting &         |No. 2 Buckwheat |Wilkenson|        |\r\n|   2  |Refining Co., Newark, N.

Grate\r\nStokers at the Plant of the Twin City Rapid Transit Co., Minneapolis,\r\nMinn.]\r\n\r\nThis increase in the efficiency of the boiler alone with the decrease in\r\nthe rate at which it is operated, will hold to a point where the\r\nradiation of heat from the boiler setting is proportionately large\r\nenough to be a governing factor in the total amount of heat absorbed.\r\n\r\nThe second reason given above for a decrease of boiler efficiency with\r\nincrease of capacity, viz., the effect of radiant heat, is to a greater\r\nextent than the first reason dependent upon a constant furnace\r\ntemperature. Any increase in this temperature will affect enormously the\r\namount of heat absorbed by radiation, as this absorption will vary as\r\nthe fourth power of the temperature of the radiating body. In this way\r\nit is seen that but a slight increase in furnace temperature will be\r\nnecessary to bring the proportional part, due to absorption by\r\nradiation, of the total heat absorbed, up to its proper proportion at\r\nthe higher ratings. This factor of furnace temperature more properly\r\nbelongs to the consideration of furnace efficiency than of boiler\r\nefficiency. There is a point, however, in any furnace above which the\r\ncombustion will be so poor as to actually reduce the furnace temperature\r\nand, therefore, the proportion of heat absorbed through radiation by a\r\ngiven amount of exposed heating surface.\r\n\r\nSince it is thus true that the efficiency of the boiler considered alone\r\nwill increase with a decreased capacity, it is evident that if the\r\nfurnace conditions are constant regardless of the load, that the\r\ncombined efficiency of boiler and furnace will also decrease with\r\nincreasing loads. This fact was clearly proven in the tests of the\r\nboilers at the Detroit Edison Company.[74] The furnace arrangement of\r\nthese boilers and the great care with which the tests were run made it\r\npossible to secure uniformly good furnace conditions irrespective of\r\nload, and here the maximum efficiency was obtained at a point somewhat\r\nless than the rated capacity of the boilers.\r\n\r\nIn some cases, however, and especially in the ordinary operation of the\r\nplant, the furnace efficiency will, up to a certain point, increase with\r\nan increase in power. This increase in furnace efficiency is ordinarily\r\nat a greater rate as the capacity increases than is the decrease in\r\nboiler efficiency, with the result that the combined efficiency of\r\nboiler and furnace will to a certain point increase with an increase in\r\ncapacity. This makes the ordinary point of maximum combined efficiency\r\nsomewhat above the rated capacity of the boiler and in many cases the\r\ncombined efficiency will be practically a constant over a considerable\r\nrange of ratings. The features limiting the establishing of the point of\r\nmaximum efficiency at a high rating are the same as those limiting the\r\namount of grate surface that can be installed under a boiler. The\r\nrelative efficiency of different combinations of boilers and furnaces at\r\ndifferent ratings depends so largely upon the furnace conditions that\r\nwhat might hold for one combination would not for another.\r\n\r\nIn view of the above, it is impossible to make a statement of the\r\nefficiency at different capacities of a boiler and furnace which will\r\nhold for any and all conditions. Fig. 40 shows in a general form the\r\nrelation of efficiency to capacity. This curve has been plotted from a\r\ngreat number of tests, all of which were corrected to bring them to\r\napproximately the same conditions. The curve represents test conditions.\r\nThe efficiencies represented are those which may be secured only under\r\nsuch conditions. The general direction of the curve, however, will be\r\nfound to hold approximately correct for operating conditions when used\r\nonly as a guide to what may be expected.\r\n\r\n[Graph: Combined Efficiency of Boiler and Furnace Per Cent\r\nagainst Per Cent of Boiler's Rated Capacity Developed\r\n\r\nFig. 40. Approximate Variation of Efficiency with Capacity under Test\r\nConditions]\r\n\r\nEconomical Loads--With the effect of capacity on economy in mind, the\r\nquestion arises as to what constitutes the economical load to be\r\ncarried. In figuring on the economical load for an individual plant, the\r\nbroader economy is to be considered, that in which, against the boiler\r\nefficiency, there is to be weighed the plant first cost, returns on such\r\ninvestment, fuel cost, labor, capacity, etc., etc. This matter has been\r\nwidely discussed, but unfortunately such discussion has been largely\r\nlimited to central power station practice. The power generated in such\r\nstations, while representing an enormous total, is by no means the\r\nlarger proportion of the total power generated throughout the country.\r\nThe factors determining the economic load for the small plant, however,\r\nare the same as in a large, and in general the statements made relative\r\nto the question are equally applicable.\r\n\r\nThe economical rating at which a boiler plant should be run is dependent\r\nsolely upon the load to be carried by that individual plant and the\r\nnature of such load. The economical load for each individual plant can\r\nbe determined only from the careful study of each individual set of\r\nconditions or by actual trial.\r\n\r\nThe controlling factor in the cost of the plant, regardless of the\r\nnature of the load, is the capacity to carry the maximum peak load that\r\nmay be thrown on the plant under any conditions.\r\n\r\nWhile load conditions, do, as stated, vary in every individual plant, in\r\na broad sense all loads may be grouped in three classes: 1st, the\r\napproximately constant 24-hour load; 2nd, the steady 10 or 12-hour load\r\nusually with a noonday period of no load; 3rd, the 24-hour variable\r\nload, found in central station practice. The economical load at which\r\nthe boiler may be run will vary with these groups:\r\n\r\n1st. For a constant load, 24 hours in the day, it will be found in most\r\ncases that, when all features are considered, the most economical load\r\nor that at which a given amount of steam can be produced the most\r\ncheaply will be considerably over the rated horse power of the boiler.\r\nHow much above the rated capacity this most economic load will be, is\r\ndependent largely upon the cost of coal at the plant, but under ordinary\r\nconditions, the point of maximum economy will probably be found to be\r\nsomewhere between 25 and 50 per cent above the rated capacity of the\r\nboilers. The capital investment must be weighed against the coal saving\r\nthrough increased thermal efficiency and the labor account, which\r\nincreases with the number of units, must be given proper consideration.\r\nWhen the question is considered in connection with a plant already\r\ninstalled, the conditions are different from where a new plant is\r\ncontemplated. In an old plant, where there are enough boilers to operate\r\nat low rates of capacity, the capital investment leads to a fixed\r\ncharge, and it will be found that the most economical load at which\r\nboilers may be operated will be lower than where a new plant is under\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\n2nd. For a load of 10 or 12 hours a day, either an approximately steady\r\nload or one in which there is a peak, where the boilers have been banked\r\nover night, the capacity at which they may be run with the best economy\r\nwill be found to be higher than for uniform 24-hour load conditions.\r\nThis is obviously due to original investment, that is, a given amount of\r\ninvested capital can be made to earn a larger return through the higher\r\noverload, and this will hold true to a point where the added return more\r\nthan offsets the decrease in actual boiler efficiency. Here again the\r\ndetermining factors of what is the economical load are the fuel and\r\nlabor cost balanced against the thermal efficiency. With a load of this\r\ncharacter, there is another factor which may affect the economical plant\r\noperating load. This is from the viewpoint of spare boilers. That such\r\nadded capacity in the way of spares is necessary is unquestionable.\r\nSince they must be installed, therefore, their presence leads to a fixed\r\ncharge and it is probable that for the plant, as a whole, the economical\r\nload will be somewhat lower than if the boilers were considered only as\r\nspares. That is, it may be found best to operate these spares as a part\r\nof the regular equipment at all times except when other boilers are off\r\nfor cleaning and repairs, thus reducing the load on the individual\r\nboilers and increasing the efficiency. Under such conditions, the added\r\nboiler units can be considered as spares only during such time as some\r\nof the boilers are not in operation.\r\n\r\nDue to the operating difficulties that may be encountered at the higher\r\noverloads, it will ordinarily be found that the most economical ratings\r\nat which to run boilers for such load conditions will be between 150 and\r\n175 per cent of rating. Here again the maximum capacity at which the\r\nboilers may be run for the best plant economy is limited by the point at\r\nwhich the efficiency drops below what is warranted in view of the first\r\ncost of the apparatus.\r\n\r\n3rd. The 24-hour variable load. This is a class of load carried by the\r\ncentral power station, a load constant only in the sense that there are\r\nno periods of no load and which varies widely with different portions of\r\nthe 24 hours. With such a load it is particularly difficult to make any\r\nassertion as to the point of maximum economy that will hold for any\r\nstation, as this point is more than with any other class of load\r\ndependent upon the factors entering into the operation of each\r\nindividual plant.\r\n\r\nThe methods of handling a load of this description vary probably more\r\nthan with any other kind of load, dependent upon fuel, labor, type of\r\nstoker, flexibility of combined furnace and boiler etc., etc.\r\n\r\nIn general, under ordinary conditions such as appear in city central\r\npower station work where the maximum peaks occur but a few times a year,\r\nthe plant should be made of such size as to enable it to carry these\r\npeaks at the maximum possible overload on the boilers, sufficient margin\r\nof course being allowed for insurance against interruption of service.\r\nWith the boilers operating at this maximum overload through the peaks a\r\nlarge sacrifice in boiler efficiency is allowable, provided that by such\r\nsacrifice the overload expected is secured.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Portion of 4890 Horse-power Installation of Babcock &\r\nWilcox Boilers at the Billings Sugar Co., Billings, Mont. 694 Horse\r\nPower of these Boilers are Equipped with Babcock and Wilcox Chain Grate\r\nStokers]\r\n\r\nSome methods of handling a load of this nature are given below:\r\n\r\nCertain plant operating conditions make it advisable, from the\r\nstandpoint of plant economy, to carry whatever load is on the plant at\r\nany time on only such boilers as will furnish the power required when\r\noperating at ratings of, say, 150 to 200 per cent. That is, all boilers\r\nwhich are in service are operated at such ratings at all times, the\r\nvariation in load being taken care of by the number of boilers on the\r\nline. Banked boilers are cut in to take care of increasing loads and\r\npeaks and placed again on bank when the peak periods have passed. It is\r\nprobable that this method of handling central station load is to-day the\r\nmost generally used.\r\n\r\nOther conditions of operation make it advisable to carry the load on a\r\ndefinite number of boiler units, operating these at slightly below their\r\nrated capacity during periods of light or low loads and securing the\r\noverload capacity during peaks by operating the same boilers at high\r\nratings. In this method there are no boilers kept on banked fires, the\r\nspares being spares in every sense of the word.\r\n\r\nA third method of handling widely varying loads which is coming somewhat\r\ninto vogue is that of considering the plant as divided, one part to take\r\ncare of what may be considered the constant plant load, the other to\r\ntake care of the floating or variable load. With such a method that\r\nportion of the plant carrying the steady load is so proportioned that\r\nthe boilers may be operated at the point of maximum efficiency, this\r\npoint being raised to a maximum through the use of economizers and the\r\ngeneral installation of any apparatus leading to such results. The\r\nvariable load will be carried on the remaining boilers of the plant\r\nunder either of the methods just given, that is, at the high ratings of\r\nall boilers in service and banking others, or a variable capacity from\r\nall boilers in service.\r\n\r\nThe opportunity is again taken to indicate the very general character of\r\nany statements made relative to the economical load for any plant and to\r\nemphasize the fact that each individual case must be considered\r\nindependently, with the conditions of operations applicable thereto.\r\n\r\nWith a thorough understanding of the meaning of boiler efficiency and\r\ncapacity and their relation to each other, it is possible to consider\r\nmore specifically the selection of boilers.\r\n\r\nThe foremost consideration is, without question, the adaptability of the\r\ndesign selected to the nature of the work to be done. An installation\r\nwhich is only temporary in its nature would obviously not warrant the\r\nfirst cost that a permanent plant would. If boilers are to carry an\r\nintermittent and suddenly fluctuating load, such as a hoisting load or a\r\nreversing mill load, a design would have to be selected that would not\r\ntend to prime with the fluctuations and sudden demand for steam. A\r\nboiler that would give the highest possible efficiency with fuel of one\r\ndescription, would not of necessity give such efficiency with a\r\ndifferent fuel. A boiler of a certain design which might be good for\r\nsmall plant practice would not, because of the limitations in\r\npracticable size of units, be suitable for large installations. A\r\ndiscussion of the relative value of designs can be carried on almost\r\nindefinitely but enough has been said to indicate that a given design\r\nwill not serve satisfactorily under all conditions and that the\r\nadaptability to the service required will be dependent upon the fuel\r\navailable, the class of labor procurable, the feed water that must be\r\nused, the nature of the plant's load, the size of the plant and the\r\nfirst cost warranted by the service the boiler is to fulfill.\r\n\r\n                                                                 TABLE 60\r\n\r\n                                    ACTUAL EVAPORATION FOR DIFFERENT PRESSURES AND TEMPERATURES OF FEED\r\n                      WATER CORRESPONDING TO ONE HORSE POWER (34½ POUNDS PER HOUR FROM AND AT 212 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT)\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nTemperature|                                                                                                                             |\r\n    of     |                                          Pressure by Gauge--Pounds per Square Inch                                          |\r\n   Feed    |                                                                                                                             |\r\n  Degrees  |                                                                                                                             |\r\nFahrenheit |  50 |  60 |  70 |  80 |  90 | 100 | 110 | 120 | 130 | 140 | 150 | 160 | 170 | 180 | 190 | 200 | 210 | 220 | 230 | 240 | 250 |\r\n-----------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\r\n 32        |28.41|28.36|28.29|28.24|28.20|28.16|28.13|28.09|28.07|28.04|28.02|27.99|27.97|27.95|27.94|27.92|27.90|27.89|27.87|27.86|27.83|\r\n 40        |28.61|28.54|28.49|28.44|28.40|28.35|28.32|28.29|28.26|28.23|28.21|28.18|28.16|28.14|28.12|28.11|28.09|28.07|28.06|28.05|28.03|\r\n 50        |28.85|28.79|28.73|28.68|28.64|28.60|28.56|28.53|28.50|28.47|28.45|28.43|28.40|28.38|28.36|28.35|28.33|28.31|28.30|28.28|28.27|\r\n 60        |29.10|29.04|28.98|28.93|28.88|28.84|28.81|28.77|28.74|28.72|28.69|28.67|28.65|28.62|28.60|28.59|28.57|28.55|28.54|28.52|28.51|\r\n 70        |29.36|29.29|29.23|29.18|29.14|29.09|29.06|29.02|28.99|28.96|28.94|28.92|28.89|28.87|28.85|28.83|28.82|28.80|28.78|28.77|28.76|\r\n 80        |29.62|29.55|29.49|29.44|29.39|29.35|29.31|29.27|29.24|29.22|29.19|29.17|29.14|29.12|29.10|29.08|29.07|29.05|29.03|29.02|29.00|\r\n 90        |29.88|29.81|29.75|29.70|29.65|29.61|29.57|29.53|29.50|29.47|29.45|29.42|29.40|29.38|29.36|29.34|29.32|29.30|29.29|29.27|29.25|\r\n100        |30.15|30.08|30.02|29.96|29.91|29.87|29.83|29.80|29.76|29.73|29.71|29.68|29.66|29.63|29.61|29.60|29.58|29.56|29.54|29.53|29.51|\r\n110        |30.42|30.35|30.29|30.23|30.18|30.14|30.10|30.06|30.03|30.00|29.97|29.95|29.92|29.90|29.88|29.86|29.84|29.82|29.81|29.79|29.77|\r\n120        |30.70|30.63|30.56|30.51|30.46|30.41|30.37|30.33|30.30|30.27|30.24|30.22|30.19|30.17|30.15|30.13|30.11|30.09|30.07|30.06|30.04|\r\n130        |30.99|30.91|30.84|30.79|30.73|30.69|30.65|30.61|30.57|30.54|30.52|30.49|30.47|30.44|30.42|30.40|30.38|30.36|30.35|30.33|30.31|\r\n140        |31.28|31.20|31.13|31.07|31.02|30.97|30.93|30.89|30.86|30.83|30.80|30.77|30.75|30.72|30.70|30.68|30.66|30.64|30.62|30.61|30.59|\r\n150        |31.58|31.49|31.42|31.36|31.31|31.26|31.22|31.18|31.14|31.11|31.08|31.06|31.03|31.01|30.98|30.96|30.94|30.92|30.91|30.89|30.87|\r\n160        |31.87|31.79|31.72|31.66|31.61|31.56|31.51|31.47|31.44|31.40|31.37|31.35|31.32|31.29|31.27|31.25|31.23|31.21|31.19|31.18|31.16|\r\n170        |32.18|32.10|32.02|31.96|31.91|31.86|31.81|31.77|31.73|31.70|31.67|31.64|31.62|31.59|31.57|31.54|31.52|31.50|31.49|31.47|31.46|\r\n180        |32.49|32.41|32.33|32.27|32.22|32.16|32.12|32.08|32.04|32.00|31.97|31.95|31.92|31.89|31.87|31.84|31.82|31.80|31.79|31.77|31.75|\r\n190        |32.81|32.72|32.65|32.59|32.53|32.47|32.43|32.38|32.35|32.32|32.29|32.26|32.23|32.20|32.17|32.15|32.13|32.11|32.09|32.07|32.05|\r\n200        |33.13|33.05|32.97|32.91|32.85|32.79|32.75|32.70|32.66|32.63|32.60|32.57|32.54|32.51|32.49|32.46|32.44|32.42|32.40|32.38|32.36|\r\n210        |33.47|33.38|33.30|33.24|33.18|33.13|33.08|33.03|32.99|32.95|32.92|32.89|32.86|32.83|32.81|32.79|32.76|32.74|32.72|32.70|32.68|\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThe proper consideration can be given to the adaptability of any boiler\r\nfor the service in view only after a thorough understanding of the\r\nrequirements of a good steam boiler, with the application of what has\r\nbeen said on the proper operation to the special requirements of each\r\ncase. Of almost equal importance to the factors mentioned are the\r\nexperience, the skill and responsibility of the manufacturer.\r\n\r\nWith the design of boiler selected that is best adapted to the service\r\nrequired, the next step is the determination of the boiler power\r\nrequirements.\r\n\r\nThe amount of steam that must be generated is determined from the steam\r\nconsumption of the prime movers. It has already been indicated that such\r\nconsumption can vary over wide limits with the size and type of the\r\napparatus used, but fortunately all types have been so tested that\r\nmanufacturers are enabled to state within very close limits the actual\r\nconsumption under any given set of conditions. It is obvious that\r\nconditions of operation will have a bearing on the steam consumption\r\nthat is as important as the type and size of the apparatus itself. This\r\nbeing the case, any tabular information that can be given on such steam\r\nconsumption, unless it be extended to an impracticable size, is only of\r\nuse for the most approximate work and more definite figures on this\r\nconsumption should in all cases be obtained from the manufacturer of the\r\napparatus to be used for the conditions under which it will operate.\r\n\r\nTo the steam consumption of the main prime movers, there is to be added\r\nthat of the auxiliaries. Again it is impossible to make a definite\r\nstatement of what this allowance should be, the figure depending wholly\r\nupon the type and the number of such auxiliaries. For approximate work,\r\nit is perhaps best to allow 15 or 20 per cent of the steam requirements\r\nof the main engines, for that of auxiliaries. Whatever figure is used\r\nshould be taken high enough to be on the conservative side.\r\n\r\nWhen any such figures are based on the actual weight of steam required,\r\nTable 60, which gives the actual evaporation for various pressures and\r\ntemperatures of feed corresponding to one boiler horse power (34.5\r\npounds of water per hour from and at 212 degrees), may be of service.\r\n\r\nWith the steam requirements known, the next step is the determination of\r\nthe number and size of boiler units to be installed. This is directly\r\naffected by the capacity at which a consideration of the economical load\r\nindicates is the best for the operating conditions which will exist. The\r\nother factors entering into such determination are the size of the plant\r\nand the character of the feed water.\r\n\r\nThe size of the plant has its bearing on the question from the fact that\r\nhigher efficiencies are in general obtained from large units, that labor\r\ncost decreases with the number of units, the first cost of brickwork is\r\nlower for large than for small size units, a general decrease in the\r\ncomplication of piping, etc., and in general the cost per horse power of\r\nany design of boiler decreases with the size of units. To illustrate\r\nthis, it is only necessary to consider a plant of, say, 10,000 boiler\r\nhorse power, consisting of 40-250 horse-power units or 17-600\r\nhorse-power units.\r\n\r\nThe feed water available has its bearing on the subject from the other\r\nside, for it has already been shown that very large units are not\r\nadvisable where the feed water is not of the best.\r\n\r\nThe character of an installment is also a factor. Where, say, 1000 horse\r\npower is installed in a plant where it is known what the ultimate\r\ncapacity is to be, the size of units should be selected with the idea of\r\nthis ultimate capacity in mind rather than the amount of the first\r\ninstallation.\r\n\r\nBoiler service, from its nature, is severe. All boilers have to be\r\ncleaned from time to time and certain repairs to settings, etc., are a\r\nnecessity. This makes it necessary, in determining the number of boilers\r\nto be installed, to allow a certain number of units or spares to be\r\noperated when any of the regular boilers must be taken off the line.\r\nWith the steam requirements determined for a plant of moderate size and\r\na reasonably constant load, it is highly advisable to install at least\r\ntwo spare boilers where a continuity of service is essential. This\r\npermits the taking off of one boiler for cleaning or repairs and still\r\nallows a spare boiler in the event of some unforeseen occurrence, such\r\nas the blowing out of a tube or the like. Investment in such spare\r\napparatus is nothing more nor less than insurance on the necessary\r\ncontinuity of service. In small plants of, say, 500 or 600 horse power,\r\ntwo spares are not usually warranted in view of the cost of such\r\ninsurance. A large plant is ordinarily laid out in a number of sections\r\nor panels and each section should have its spare boiler or boilers even\r\nthough the sections are cross connected. In central station work, where\r\nthe peaks are carried on the boilers brought up from the bank, such\r\nspares are, of course, in addition to these banked boilers. From the\r\naspect of cleaning boilers alone, the number of spare boilers is\r\ndetermined by the nature of any scale that may be formed. If scale is\r\nformed so rapidly that the boilers cannot be kept clean enough for good\r\noperating results, by cleaning in rotation, one at a time, the number of\r\nspares to take care of such proper cleaning will naturally increase.\r\n\r\nIn view of the above, it is evident that only a suggestion can be made\r\nas to the number and size of units, as no recommendation will hold for\r\nall cases. In general, it will be found best to install units of the\r\nlargest possible size compatible with the size of the plant and\r\noperating conditions, with the total power requirements divided among\r\nsuch a number of units as will give proper flexibility of load, with\r\nsuch additional units for spares as conditions of cleaning and insurance\r\nagainst interruption of service warrant.\r\n\r\nIn closing the subject of the selection of boilers, it may not be out of\r\nplace to refer to the effect of the builder's guarantee upon the\r\ndetermination of design to be used. Here in one of its most important\r\naspects appears the responsibility of the manufacturer. Emphasis has\r\nbeen laid on the difference between test results and those secured in\r\nordinary operating practice. That such a difference exists is well known\r\nand it is now pretty generally realized that it is the responsible\r\nmanufacturer who, where guarantees are necessary, submits the\r\nconservative figures, figures which may readily be exceeded under test\r\nconditions and which may be closely approached under the ordinary plant\r\nconditions that will be met in daily operation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOPERATION AND CARE OF BOILERS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe general subject of boiler room practice may be considered from two\r\naspects. The first is that of the broad plant economy, with a suggestion\r\nas to the methods to be followed in securing the best economical results\r\nwith the apparatus at hand and procurable. The second deals rather with\r\nspecific recommendations which should be followed in plant practice,\r\nrecommendations leading not only to economy but also to safety and\r\ncontinuity of service. Such recommendations are dictated from an\r\nunderstanding of the nature of steam generating apparatus and its\r\noperation, as covered previously in this book.\r\n\r\nIt has already been pointed out that the attention given in recent years\r\nto steam generating practice has come with a realization of the wide\r\ndifference existing between the results being obtained in every-day\r\noperation and those theoretically possible. The amount of such attention\r\nand regulation given to the steam generating end of a power plant,\r\nhowever, is comparatively small in relation to that given to the balance\r\nof the plant, but it may be safely stated that it is here that there is\r\nthe greatest assurance of a return for the attention given.\r\n\r\nIn the endeavor to increase boiler room efficiency, it is of the utmost\r\nimportance that a standard basis be set by which average results are to\r\nbe judged. With the theoretical efficiency obtainable varying so widely,\r\nthis standard cannot be placed at the highest efficiency that has been\r\nobtained regardless of operating conditions. It is better set at the\r\nbest obtainable results for each individual plant under its conditions\r\nof installation and daily operation.\r\n\r\nWith an individual standard so set, present practice can only be\r\nimproved by a systematic effort to approach this standard. The degree\r\nwith which operating results will approximate such a standard will be\r\nfound to be directly proportional to the amount of intelligent\r\nsupervision given the operation. For such supervision to be given, it is\r\nnecessary to have not only a full realization of what the plant can do\r\nunder the best operating conditions but also a full and complete\r\nknowledge of what it is doing under all of the different conditions that\r\nmay arise. What the plant is doing should be made a matter of continuous\r\nrecord so arranged that the results may be directly compared for any\r\nperiod or set of conditions, and where such results vary from the\r\nstandard set, steps must be taken immediately to remedy the causes of\r\nsuch failings. Such a record is an important check in the losses in the\r\nplant.\r\n\r\nAs the size of the plant and the fuel consumption increase, such a check\r\nof losses and recording of results becomes a necessity. In the larger\r\nplants, the saving of but a fraction of one per cent in the fuel bill\r\nrepresents an amount running into thousands of dollars annually, while\r\nthe expense of the proper supervision to secure such saving is small.\r\nThe methods of supervision followed in the large plants are necessarily\r\nelaborate and complete. In the smaller plants the same methods may be\r\nfollowed on a more moderate scale with a corresponding saving in fuel\r\nand an inappreciable increase in either plant organization or expense.\r\n\r\nThere has been within the last few years a great increase in the\r\npracticability and reliability of the various types of apparatus by\r\nwhich the records of plant operation may be secured. Much of this\r\napparatus is ingenious and, considering the work to be done, is\r\nremarkably accurate. From the delicate nature of some of the apparatus,\r\nthe liability to error necessitates frequent calibration but even where\r\nthe accuracy is known to be only within limits of, say, 5 per cent\r\neither way, the records obtained are of the greatest service in\r\nconsidering relative results. Some of the records desirable and the\r\napparatus for securing them are given below.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 2400 Horse-power Installation of Cross Drum Babcock &\r\nWilcox Boilers and Superheaters at the Westinghouse Electric and\r\nManufacturing Co., East Pittsburgh, Pa.]\r\n\r\nInasmuch as the ultimate measure of the efficiency of the boiler plant\r\nis the cost of steam generation, the important records are those of\r\nsteam generated and fuel consumed Records of temperature, analyses,\r\ndraft and the like, serve as a check on this consumption, indicating the\r\ndistribution of the losses and affording a means of remedying conditions\r\nwhere improvement is possible.\r\n\r\nCoal Records--There are many devices on the market for conveniently\r\nweighing the coal used. These are ordinarily accurate within close\r\nlimits, and where the size or nature of the plant warrants the\r\ninvestment in such a device, its use is to be recommended. The coal\r\nconsumption should be recorded by some other method than from the\r\nweights of coal purchased. The total weight gives no way of dividing the\r\nconsumption into periods and it will unquestionably be found to be\r\nprofitable to put into operation some scheme by which the coal is\r\nweighed as it is used. In this way, the coal consumption, during any\r\nspecific period of the plant's operation, can be readily seen. The\r\nsimplest of such methods which may be used in small plants is the actual\r\nweighing on scales of the fuel as it is brought into the fire room and\r\nthe recording of such weights.\r\n\r\nAside from the actual weight of the fuel used, it is often advisable to\r\nkeep other coal records, coal and ash analyses and the like, for the\r\nevaporation to be expected will be dependent upon the grade of fuel used\r\nand its calorific value, fusibility of its ash, and like factors.\r\n\r\nThe highest calorific value for unit cost is not necessarily the\r\nindication of the best commercial results. The cost of fuel is governed\r\nby this calorific value only when such value is modified by local\r\nconditions of capacity, labor and commercial efficiency. One of the\r\nimportant factors entering into fuel cost is the consideration of the\r\ncost of ash handling and the maintenance of ash handling apparatus if\r\nsuch be installed. The value of a fuel, regardless of its calorific\r\nvalue, is to be based only on the results obtained in every-day plant\r\noperation.\r\n\r\nCoal and ash analyses used in connection with the amount of fuel\r\nconsumed, are a direct indication of the relation between the results\r\nbeing secured and the standard of results which has been set for the\r\nplant. The methods of such analyses have already been described. The\r\napparatus is simple and the degree of scientific knowledge necessary is\r\nonly such as may be readily mastered by plant operatives.\r\n\r\nThe ash content of a fuel, as indicated from a coal analysis checked\r\nagainst ash weights as actually found in plant operation, acts as a\r\ncheck on grate efficiency. The effect of any saving in the ashes, that\r\nis, the permissible ash to be allowed in the fuel purchased, is\r\ndetermined by the point at which the cost of handling, combined with the\r\nfalling off in the evaporation, exceeds the saving of fuel cost through\r\nthe use of poorer coal.\r\n\r\nWater Records--Water records with the coal consumption, form the basis\r\nfor judging the economic production of steam. The methods of securing\r\nsuch records are of later introduction than for coal, but great advances\r\nhave been made in the apparatus to be used. Here possibly, to a greater\r\nextent than in any recording device, are the records of value in\r\ndetermining relative evaporation, that is, an error is rather allowable\r\nprovided such an error be reasonably constant.\r\n\r\nThe apparatus for recording such evaporation is of two general classes:\r\nThose measuring water before it is fed to the boiler and those measuring\r\nthe steam as it leaves. Of the first, the venturi meter is perhaps the\r\nbest known, though recently there has come into considerable vogue an\r\napparatus utilizing a weir notch for the measuring of such water. Both\r\nmethods are reasonably accurate and apparatus of this description has an\r\nadvantage over one measuring steam in that it may be calibrated much\r\nmore readily. Of the steam measuring devices, the one in most common use\r\nis the steam flow meter. Provided the instruments are selected for a\r\nproper flow, etc., they are of inestimable value in indicating the steam\r\nconsumption. Where such instruments are placed on the various engine\r\nroom lines, they will immediately indicate an excessive consumption for\r\nany one of the units. With a steam flow meter placed on each boiler, it\r\nis possible to fix relatively the amount produced by each boiler and,\r\nconsidered in connection with some of the \"check\" records described\r\nbelow, clearly indicate whether its portion of the total steam produced\r\nis up to the standard set for the over-all boiler room efficiency.\r\n\r\nFlue Gas Analysis--The value of a flue gas analysis as a measure of\r\nfurnace efficiency has already been indicated. There are on the market a\r\nnumber of instruments by which a continuous record of the carbon dioxide\r\nin the flue gases may be secured and in general the results so recorded\r\nare accurate. The limitations of an analysis showing only CO_{2} and the\r\nnecessity of completing such an analysis with an Orsat, or like\r\napparatus, and in this way checking the automatic device, have already\r\nbeen pointed out, but where such records are properly checked from time\r\nto time and are used in conjunction with a record of flue temperatures,\r\nthe losses due to excess air or incomplete combustion and the like may\r\nbe directly compared for any period. Such records act as a means for\r\ncontrolling excess air and also as a check on individual firemen.\r\n\r\nWhere the size of a plant will not warrant the purchase of an expensive\r\ncontinuous CO_{2} recorder, it is advisable to make analyses of samples\r\nfor various conditions of firing and to install an apparatus whereby a\r\nsample of flue gas covering a period of, say, eight hours, may be\r\nobtained and such a sample afterwards analyzed.\r\n\r\nTemperature Records--Flue gas temperatures, feed water temperatures and\r\nsteam temperatures are all taken with recording thermometers, any number\r\nof which will, when properly calibrated, give accurate results.\r\n\r\nA record of flue temperatures is serviceable in checking stack losses\r\nand, in general, the cleanliness of the boiler. A record of steam\r\ntemperatures, where superheaters are used, will indicate excessive\r\nfluctuations and lead to an investigation of their cause. Feed\r\ntemperatures are valuable in showing that the full benefit of the\r\nexhaust steam is being derived.\r\n\r\nDraft Regulation--As the capacity of a boiler varies with the combustion\r\nrate and this rate with the draft, an automatic apparatus satisfactorily\r\nvarying this draft with the capacity demands on the boiler will\r\nobviously be advantageous.\r\n\r\nAs has been pointed out, any fuel has some rate of combustion at which\r\nthe best results will be obtained. In a properly designed plant where\r\nthe load is reasonably steady, the draft necessary to secure such a rate\r\nmay be regulated automatically.\r\n\r\nAutomatic apparatus for the regulation of draft has recently reached a\r\nstage of perfection which in the larger plants at any rate makes its\r\ninstallation advisable. The installation of a draft gauge or gauges is\r\nstrongly to be recommended and a record of such drafts should be kept as\r\nbeing a check on the combustion rates.\r\n\r\nAn important feature to be considered in the installing of all recording\r\napparatus is its location. Thermometers, draft gauges and flue gas\r\nsampling pipes should be so located as to give as nearly as possible an\r\naverage of the conditions, the gases flowing freely over the ends of the\r\nthermometers, couples and sampling pipes. With the location permanent,\r\nthere is no security that the samples may be considered an average but\r\nin any event comparative results will be secured which will be useful in\r\nplant operation. The best permanent location of apparatus will vary\r\nconsiderably with the design of the boiler.\r\n\r\nIt may not be out of place to refer briefly to some of the shortcomings\r\nfound in boiler room practice, with a suggestion as to a means of\r\novercoming them.\r\n\r\n1st. It is sometimes found that the operating force is not fully\r\nacquainted with the boilers and apparatus. Probably the most general of\r\nsuch shortcomings is the fixed idea in the heads of the operatives that\r\nboilers run above their rated capacity are operating under a state of\r\nstrain and that by operating at less than their rated capacity the most\r\neconomical service is assured, whereas, by determining what a boiler\r\nwill do, it may be found that the most economical rating under the\r\nconditions of the plant will be considerably in excess of the builder's\r\nrating. Such ideas can be dislodged only by demonstrating to the\r\noperatives what maximum load the boilers can carry, showing how the\r\neconomy will vary with the load and the determining of the economical\r\nload for the individual plant in question.\r\n\r\n2nd. Stokers. With stoker-fired boilers, it is essential that the\r\noperators know the limitations of their stokers as determined by their\r\nindividual installation. A thorough understanding of the requirements of\r\nefficient handling must be insisted upon. The operatives must realize\r\nthat smokeless stacks are not necessarily the indication of good\r\ncombustion for, as has been pointed out, absolute smokelessness is\r\noftentimes secured at an enormous loss in efficiency through excess air.\r\n\r\nAnother feature in stoker-fired plants is in the cleaning of fires. It\r\nmust be impressed upon the operatives that before the fires are cleaned\r\nthey should be put into condition for such cleaning. If this cleaning is\r\ndone at a definite time, regardless of whether the fires are in the best\r\ncondition for cleaning, there will be a great loss of good fuel with the\r\nashes.\r\n\r\n3rd. It is necessary that in each individual plant there be a basis on\r\nwhich to judge the cleanliness of a boiler. From the operative's\r\nstandpoint, it is probably more necessary that there be a thorough\r\nunderstanding of the relation between scale and tube difficulties than\r\nbetween scale and efficiency. It is, of course, impossible to keep\r\nboilers absolutely free from scale at all times, but experience in each\r\nindividual plant determines the limit to which scale can be allowed to\r\nform before tube difficulties will begin or a perceptible falling off in\r\nefficiency will take place. With such a limit of scale formation fixed,\r\nthe operatives should be impressed with the danger of allowing it to be\r\nexceeded.\r\n\r\n4th. The operatives should be instructed as to the losses resulting from\r\nexcess air due to leaks in the setting and as to losses in efficiency\r\nand capacity due to the by-passing of gases through the setting, that\r\nis, not following the path of the baffles as originally installed. In\r\nreplacing tubes and in cleaning the heating surfaces, care must be taken\r\nnot to dislodge baffle brick or tile.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 2000 Horse-power Installation of Babcock & Wilcox\r\nBoilers, Equipped with Babcock & Wilcox Chain Grate Stokers at the\r\nSunnyside Plant of the Pennsylvania Tunnel and Terminal Railroad Co.,\r\nLong Island City, N. Y.]\r\n\r\n5th. That an increase in the temperature of the feed reduces the amount\r\nof work demanded from the boiler has been shown. The necessity of\r\nkeeping the feed temperature as high as the quantity of exhaust steam\r\nwill allow should be thoroughly understood. As an example of this, there\r\nwas a case brought to our attention where a large amount of exhaust\r\nsteam was wasted simply because the feed pump showed a tendency to leak\r\nif the temperature of feed water was increased above 140 degrees. The\r\namount wasted was sufficient to increase the temperature to 180 degrees\r\nbut was not utilized simply because of the slight expense necessary to\r\noverhaul the feed pump.\r\n\r\nThe highest return will be obtained when the speed of the feed pumps is\r\nmaintained reasonably constant for should the pumps run very slowly at\r\ntimes, there may be a loss of the steam from other auxiliaries by\r\nblowing off from the heaters.\r\n\r\n6th. With a view to checking steam losses through the useless blowing of\r\nsafety valves, the operative should be made to realize the great amount\r\nof steam that it is possible to get through a pipe of a given size.\r\nOftentimes the fireman feels a sense of security from objections to a\r\ndrop in steam simply because of the blowing of safety valves, not\r\nconsidering the losses due to such a cause and makes no effort to check\r\nthis flow either by manipulation of dampers or regulation of fires.\r\n\r\nThe few of the numerous shortcomings outlined above, which may be found\r\nin many plants, are almost entirely due to lack of knowledge on the part\r\nof the operating crew as to the conditions existing in their own plants\r\nand the better performances being secured in others. Such shortcomings\r\ncan be overcome only by the education of the operatives, the showing of\r\nthe defects of present methods, and instruction in better methods. Where\r\nsuch instruction is necessary, the value of records is obvious. There is\r\nfortunately a tendency toward the employment of a better class of labor\r\nin the boiler room, a tendency which is becoming more and more marked as\r\nthe realization of the possible saving in this end of the plant\r\nincreases.\r\n\r\nThe second aspect of boiler room management, dealing with specific\r\nrecommendations as to the care and operation of the boilers, is dictated\r\nlargely by the nature of the apparatus. Some of the features to be\r\nwatched in considering this aspect follow.\r\n\r\nBefore placing a new boiler in service, a careful and thorough\r\nexamination should be made of the pressure parts and the setting. The\r\nboiler as erected should correspond in its baffle openings, where\r\nbaffles are adjustable, with the prints furnished for its erection, and\r\nsuch baffles should be tight. The setting should be so constructed that\r\nthe boiler is free to expand without interfering with the brickwork.\r\nThis ability to expand applies also to blow-off and other piping. After\r\nerection all mortar and chips of brick should be cleaned from the\r\npressure parts. The tie rods should be set up snug and then slacked\r\nslightly until the setting has become thoroughly warm after the first\r\nfiring. The boiler should be examined internally before starting to\r\ninsure the absence of dirt, any foreign material such as waste, and\r\ntools. Oil and paint are sometimes found in the interior of a new boiler\r\nand where such is the case, a quantity of soda ash should be placed\r\nwithin it, the boiler filled with water to its normal level and a slow\r\nfire started. After twelve hours of slow simmering, the fire should be\r\nallowed to die out, the boiler cooled slowly and then opened and washed\r\nout thoroughly. Such a proceeding will remove all oil and grease from\r\nthe interior and prevent the possibility of foaming and tube\r\ndifficulties when the boiler is placed in service.\r\n\r\nThe water column piping should be examined and known to be free and\r\nclear. The water level, as indicated by the gauge glass, should be\r\nchecked by opening the gauge cocks.\r\n\r\nThe method of drying out a brick setting before placing a boiler in\r\noperation is described later in the discussion of boiler settings.\r\n\r\nA boiler should not be cut into the line with other boilers until the\r\npressure within it is approximately that in the steam main. The boiler\r\nstop valve should be opened very slowly until it is fully opened. The\r\narrangement of piping should be such that there can be no possibility of\r\nwater collecting in a pocket between the boiler and the main, from which\r\nit can be carried over into the steam line when a boiler is cut in.\r\n\r\nIn regular operation the safety valve and steam gauge should be checked\r\ndaily. In small plants the steam pressure should be raised sufficiently\r\nto cause the safety valves to blow, at which time the steam gauge should\r\nindicate the pressure at which the valve is known to be set. If it does\r\nnot, one is in error and the gauge should be compared with one of known\r\naccuracy and any error at once rectified.\r\n\r\nIn large plants such a method of checking would result in losses too\r\ngreat to be allowed. Here the gauges and valves are ordinarily checked\r\nat the time a boiler is cut out, the valves being assured of not\r\nsticking by daily instantaneous opening through manipulation by hand of\r\nthe valve lever. The daily blowing of the safety valve acts not only as\r\na check on the gauge but insures the valve against sticking.\r\n\r\nThe water column should be blown down thoroughly at least once on every\r\nshift and the height of water indicated by the glass checked by the\r\ngauge cocks. The bottom blow-offs should be kept tight. These should be\r\nopened at least once daily to blow from the mud drum any sediment that\r\nmay have collected and to reduce the concentration. The amount of\r\nblowing down and the frequency is, of course, determined by the nature\r\nof the feed water used.\r\n\r\nIn case of low water, resulting either from carelessness or from some\r\nunforeseen condition of operation, the essential object to be obtained\r\nis the extinguishing of the fire in the quickest possible manner. Where\r\npracticable, this is best accomplished by the playing of a heavy stream\r\nof water from a hose on the fire. Another method, perhaps not so\r\nefficient, but more generally recommended, is the covering of the fire\r\nwith wet ashes or fresh fuel. A boiler so treated should be cut out of\r\nline after such an occurrence and a thorough inspection made to\r\nascertain what damage, if any, has been done before it is again placed\r\nin service.\r\n\r\nThe efficiency and capacity depend to an extent very much greater than\r\nis ordinarily realized upon the cleanliness of the heating surfaces,\r\nboth externally and internally, and too much stress cannot be put upon\r\nthe necessity for systematic cleaning as a regular feature in the plant\r\noperation.\r\n\r\nThe outer surfaces of the tubes should be blown free from soot at\r\nregular intervals, the frequency of such cleaning periods being\r\ndependent upon the class of fuel used. The most efficient way of blowing\r\nsoot from the tubes is by means of a steam lance with which all parts of\r\nthe surfaces are reached and swept clean. There are numerous soot\r\nblowing devices on the market which are designed to be permanently fixed\r\nwithin the boiler setting. Where such devices are installed, there are\r\ncertain features that must be watched to avoid trouble. If there is any\r\nleakage of water of condensation within the setting coming into contact\r\nwith the boiler tubes, it will tend toward corrosion, or if in contact\r\nwith the heated brickwork will cause rapid disintegration of the\r\nsetting. If the steam jets are so placed that they impinge directly\r\nagainst the tubes, erosion may take place. Where such permanent soot\r\nblowers are installed, too much care cannot be taken to guard against\r\nthese possibilities.\r\n\r\nInternally, the tubes must be kept free from scale, the ingredients of\r\nwhich a study of the chapter on the impurities of water indicates are\r\npresent in varying quantities in all feed waters. Not only has the\r\npresence of scale a direct bearing on the efficiency and capacity to be\r\nobtained from a boiler but its absence is an assurance against the\r\nburning out of tubes.\r\n\r\nIn the absence of a blow-pipe action of the flames, it is impossible to\r\nburn a metal surface where water is in intimate contact with that\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\nIn stoker-fired plants where a blast is used, and the furnace is not\r\nproperly designed, there is a danger of a blow-pipe action if the fires\r\nare allowed to get too thin. The rapid formation of steam at such points\r\nof localized heat may lead to the burning of the metal of the tubes.\r\n\r\nAny formation of scale on the interior surface of a boiler keeps the\r\nwater from such a surface and increases its tendency to burn. Particles\r\nof loose scale that may become detached will lodge at certain points in\r\nthe tubes and localize this tendency at such points. It is because of\r\nthe danger of detaching scale and causing loose flakes to be present\r\nthat the use of a boiler compound is not recommended for the removal of\r\nscale that has already formed in a boiler. This question is covered in\r\nthe treatment of feed waters. If oil is allowed to enter a boiler, its\r\naction is the same as that of scale in keeping the water away from the\r\nmetal surfaces.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 41]\r\n\r\nIt has been proven beyond a doubt that a very large percentage of tube\r\nlosses is due directly to the presence of scale which, in many\r\ninstances, has been so thin as to be considered of no moment, and the\r\nimportance of maintaining the boiler heating surfaces in a clean\r\ncondition cannot be emphasized too strongly.\r\n\r\nThe internal cleaning can best be accomplished by means of an air or\r\nwater-driven turbine, the cutter heads of which may be changed to handle\r\nvarious thicknesses of scale. Fig. 41 shows a turbine cleaner with\r\nvarious cutting heads, which has been found to give satisfactory\r\nservice.\r\n\r\nWhere a water-driven turbine is used, it should be connected to a pump\r\nwhich will deliver at least 120 gallons per minute per cleaner at 150\r\npounds pressure. This pressure should never be less than 90 pounds if\r\nsatisfactory results are desired. Where an air-driven turbine is used,\r\nthe pressure should be at least 100 pounds, though 150 pounds is\r\npreferable, and sufficient water should be introduced into the tube to\r\nkeep the cutting head cool and assist in washing down the scale as it is\r\nchipped off.\r\n\r\nWhere scale has been allowed to accumulate to an excessive thickness,\r\nthe work of removal is difficult and tedious. Where such a heavy scale\r\nis of sulphate formation, its removal may be assisted by filling the\r\nboiler with water to which there has been added a quantity of soda ash,\r\na bucketful to each drum, starting a low fire and allowing the water to\r\nboil for twenty-four hours with no pressure on the boiler. It should be\r\ncooled slowly, drained, and the turbine cleaner used immediately, as the\r\nscale will tend to harden rapidly under the action of the air.\r\n\r\nWhere oil has been allowed to get into a boiler, it should be removed\r\nbefore placing the boiler in service, as described previously where\r\nreference is made to its removal by boiling out with soda ash.\r\n\r\nWhere pitting or corrosion is noted, the parts affected should be\r\ncarefully cleaned and the interior of the drums should be painted with\r\nwhite zinc if the boiler is to remain idle. The cause of such action\r\nshould be immediately ascertained and steps taken to apply the proper\r\nremedy.\r\n\r\nWhen making an internal inspection of a boiler or when cleaning the\r\ninterior heating surfaces, great care must be taken to guard against the\r\npossibility of steam entering the boiler in question from other boilers\r\non the same line either through the careless opening of the boiler stop\r\nvalve or some auxiliary valve or from an open blow-off. Bad accidents\r\nthrough scalding have resulted from the neglect of this precaution.\r\n\r\nBoiler brickwork should be kept pointed up and all cracks filled. The\r\nboiler baffles should be kept tight to prevent by-passing of any gases\r\nthrough the heating surfaces.\r\n\r\nBoilers should be taken out of service at regular intervals for cleaning\r\nand repairs. When this is done, the boiler should be cooled slowly, and\r\nwhen possible, be allowed to stand for twenty-four hours after the fire\r\nis drawn before opening. The cooling process should not be hurried by\r\nallowing cold air to rush through the setting as this will invariably\r\ncause trouble with the brickwork. When a boiler is off for cleaning, a\r\ncareful examination should be made of its condition, both external and\r\ninternal, and all leaks of steam, water and air through the setting\r\nstopped. If water is allowed to come into contact with brickwork that is\r\nheated, rapid disintegration will take place. If water is allowed to\r\ncome into contact with the metal of the boiler when out of service,\r\nthere is a likelihood of corrosion.\r\n\r\nIf a boiler is to remain idle for some time, its deterioration may be\r\nmuch more rapid than when in service. If the period for which it is to\r\nbe laid off is not to exceed three months, it may be filled with water\r\nwhile out of service. The boiler should first be cleaned thoroughly,\r\ninternally and externally, all soot and ashes being removed from the\r\nexterior of the pressure parts and any accumulation of scale removed\r\nfrom the interior surfaces. It should then be filled with water, to\r\nwhich five or six pails of soda ash have been added, a slow fire started\r\nto drive the air from the boiler, the fire drawn and the boiler pumped\r\nfull. In this condition it may be kept for some time without bad\r\neffects.\r\n\r\nIf the boiler is to be out of service for more than three months, it\r\nshould be emptied, drained and thoroughly dried after being cleaned. A\r\ntray of quick lime should be placed in each drum, the boiler closed, the\r\ngrates covered and a quantity of quick lime placed on top of the\r\ncovering. Special care should be taken to prevent air, steam or water\r\nleaks into the boiler or onto the pressure parts to obviate danger of\r\ncorrosion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 3000 Horse-power Installation of Babcock & Wilcox Boilers\r\nin the Main Power Plant, Chicago & Northwestern Ry. Depot, Chicago,\r\nIll.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBRICKWORK BOILER SETTINGS\r\n\r\n\r\nA consideration of the losses in boiler efficiency, due to the effects\r\nof excess air, clearly indicates the necessity of maintaining the brick\r\nsetting of a boiler tight and free from air leaks. In view of the\r\ntemperatures to which certain portions of such a setting are subjected,\r\nthe material to be used in its construction must be of the best\r\nprocurable.\r\n\r\nBoiler settings to-day consist almost universally of brickwork--two\r\nkinds being used, namely, red brick and fire brick.\r\n\r\nThe red brick should only be used in such portions of the setting as are\r\nwell protected from the heat. In such location, their service is not so\r\nsevere as that of fire brick and ordinarily, if such red brick are\r\nsound, hard, well burned and uniform, they will serve their purpose.\r\n\r\nThe fire brick should be selected with the greatest care, as it is this\r\nportion of the setting that has to endure the high temperatures now\r\ndeveloped in boiler practice. To a great extent, the life of a boiler\r\nsetting is dependent upon the quality of the fire brick used and the\r\ncare exercised in its laying.\r\n\r\nThe best fire brick are manufactured from the fire clays of\r\nPennsylvania. South and west from this locality the quality of fire clay\r\nbecomes poorer as the distance increases, some of the southern fire\r\nclays containing a considerable percentage of iron oxide.\r\n\r\nUntil very recently, the important characteristic on which to base a\r\njudgment of the suitability of fire brick for use in connection with\r\nboiler settings has been considered the melting point, or the\r\ntemperature at which the brick will liquify and run. Experience has\r\nshown, however, that this point is only important within certain limits\r\nand that the real basis on which to judge material of this description\r\nis, from the boiler man's standpoint, the quality of plasticity under a\r\ngiven load. This tendency of a brick to become plastic occurs at a\r\ntemperature much below the melting point and to a degree that may cause\r\nthe brick to become deformed under the stress to which it is subjected.\r\nThe allowable plastic or softening temperature will naturally be\r\nrelative and dependent upon the stress to be endured.\r\n\r\nWith the plasticity the determining factor, the perfect fire brick is\r\none whose critical point of plasticity lies well above the working\r\ntemperature of the fire. It is probable that there are but few brick on\r\nthe market which would not show, if tested, this critical temperature at\r\nthe stress met with in arch construction at a point less than 2400\r\ndegrees. The fact that an arch will stand for a long period under\r\nfurnace temperatures considerably above this point is due entirely to\r\nthe fact that its temperature as a whole is far below the furnace\r\ntemperature and only about 10 per cent of its cross section nearest the\r\nfire approaches the furnace temperature. This is borne out by the fact\r\nthat arches which are heated on both sides to the full temperature of an\r\nordinary furnace will first bow down in the middle and eventually fall.\r\n\r\nA method of testing brick for this characteristic is given in the\r\nTechnologic Paper No. 7 of the Bureau of Standards dealing with \"The\r\ntesting of clay refractories with special reference to their load\r\ncarrying capacity at furnace temperatures.\" Referring to the test for\r\nthis specific characteristic, this publication recommends the following:\r\n\"When subjected to the load test in a manner substantially as described\r\nin this bulletin, at 1350 degrees centigrade (2462 degrees Fahrenheit),\r\nand under a load of 50 pounds per square inch, a standard fire brick\r\ntested on end should show no serious deformation and should not be\r\ncompressed more than one inch, referred to the standard length of nine\r\ninches.\"\r\n\r\nIn the Bureau of Standards test for softening temperature, or critical\r\ntemperature of plasticity under the specified load, the brick are tested\r\non end. In testing fire brick for boiler purposes such a method might be\r\ncriticised, because such a test is a compression test and subject to\r\nerrors from unequal bearing surfaces causing shear. Furthermore, a\r\nseries of samples, presumably duplicates, will not fail in the same way,\r\ndue to the mechanical variation in the manufacture of the brick. Arches\r\nthat fail through plasticity show that the tensile strength of the brick\r\nis important, this being evidenced by the fact that the bottom of a\r\nwedge brick in an arch that has failed is usually found to be wider than\r\nthe top and the adjacent bricks are firmly cemented together.\r\n\r\nA better method of testing is that of testing the brick as a beam\r\nsubjected to its own weight and not on end. This method has been used\r\nfor years in Germany and is recommended by the highest authorities in\r\nceramics. It takes into account the failure by tension in the brick as\r\nwell as by compression and thus covers the tension element which is\r\nimportant in arch construction.\r\n\r\nThe plastic point under a unit stress of 100 pounds per square inch,\r\nwhich may be taken as the average maximum arch stress, should be above\r\n2800 degrees to give perfect results and should be above 2400 degrees to\r\nenable the brick to be used with any degree of satisfaction.\r\n\r\nThe other characteristics by which the quality of a fire brick is to be\r\njudged are:\r\n\r\nFusion point. In view of the fact that the critical temperature of\r\nplasticity is below the fusion point, this is only important as an\r\nindication from high fusion point of a high temperature of plasticity.\r\n\r\nHardness. This is a relative quality based on an arbitrary scale of 10\r\nand is an indication of probable cracking and spalling.\r\n\r\nExpansion. The lineal expansion per brick in inches. This characteristic\r\nin conjunction with hardness is a measure of the physical movement of\r\nthe brick as affecting a mass of brickwork, such movement resulting in\r\ncracked walls, etc. The expansion will vary between wide limits in\r\ndifferent brick and provided such expansion is not in excess of, say,\r\n.05 inch in a 9-inch brick, when measured at 2600 degrees, it is not\r\nparticularly important in a properly designed furnace, though in general\r\nthe smaller the expansion the better.\r\n\r\nCompression. The strength necessary to cause crushing of the brick at\r\nthe center of the 4½ inch face by a steel block one inch square. The\r\ncompression should ordinarily be low, a suggested standard being that a\r\nbrick show signs of crushing at 7500 pounds.\r\n\r\nSize of Nodules. The average size of flint grains when the brick is\r\ncarefully crushed. The scale of these sizes may be considered: Small,\r\nsize of anthracite rice; large, size of anthracite pea.\r\n\r\nRatio of Nodules. The percentage of a given volume occupied by the flint\r\ngrains. This scale may be considered: High, 90 to 100 per cent; medium,\r\n50 to 90 per cent; low, 10 to 50 per cent.\r\n\r\nThe statement of characteristics suggested as desirable, are for arch\r\npurposes where the hardest service is met. For side wall purposes the\r\ncompression and hardness limit may be raised considerably and the\r\nplastic point lowered.\r\n\r\nAside from the physical properties by which a fire brick is judged, it\r\nis sometimes customary to require a chemical analysis of the brick. Such\r\nan analysis is only necessary as determining the amount of total basic\r\nfluxes (K_{2}O, Na_{2}O, CaO, MgO and FeO). These fluxes are ordinarily\r\ncombined into one expression, indicated by the symbol RO. This total\r\nbecomes important only above 0.2 molecular equivalent as expressed in\r\nceramic empirical formulae, and this limit should not be exceeded.[75]\r\n\r\nFrom the nature of fire brick, their value can only be considered from a\r\nrelative standpoint. Generally speaking, what are known as first-grade\r\nfire brick may be divided into three classes, suitable for various\r\nconditions of operation, as follows:\r\n\r\nClass A. For stoker-fired furnaces where high overloads are to be\r\nexpected or where other extreme conditions of service are apt to occur.\r\n\r\nClass B. For ordinary stoker settings where there will be no excessive\r\noverloads required from the boiler or any hand-fired furnaces where the\r\nrates of driving will be high for such practice.\r\n\r\nClass C. For ordinary hand-fired settings where the presumption is that\r\nthe boilers will not be overloaded except at rare intervals and for\r\nshort periods only.\r\n\r\nTable 61 gives the characteristics of these three classes according to\r\nthe features determining the quality. This table indicates that the\r\nhardness of the brick in general increases with the poorer qualities.\r\nProvided the hardness is sufficient to enable the brick to withstand its\r\nload, additional hardness is a detriment rather than an advantage.\r\n\r\n                                 TABLE 61\r\n\r\n                 APPROXIMATE CLASSIFICATION OF FIRE BRICK\r\n\r\n ________________________________________________________________________\r\n|                     |                |                |                |\r\n| Characteristics     |     Class A    |     Class B    |     Class C    |\r\n|_____________________|________________|________________|________________|\r\n|                     |                |                |                |\r\n| Fuse Point, Degrees | Safe at Degrees| Safe at Degrees| Safe at Degrees|\r\n|   Fahrenheit        |    3200-3300   |    2900-3200   |    2900-3000   |\r\n|                     |                |                |                |\r\n| Compression Pounds  |    6500-7500   |   7500-11,000  |   8500-15,000  |\r\n|                     |                |                |                |\r\n| Hardness Relative   |       1-2      |       2-4      |       4-6      |\r\n|                     |                |                |                |\r\n| Size of Nodules     |     Medium     |   Medium to    |Medium to Large |\r\n|                     |                |  Medium Large  |                |\r\n|                     |                |                |                |\r\n| Ratio of Nodules    |      High      | Medium to High |   Medium Low   |\r\n|                     |                |                |    to Medium   |\r\n|_____________________|________________|________________|________________|\r\n\r\nAn approximate determination of the quality of a fire brick may be made\r\nfrom the appearance of a fracture. Where such a fracture is open, clean,\r\nwhite and flinty, the brick in all probability is of a good quality. If\r\nthis fracture has the fine uniform texture of bread, the brick is\r\nprobably poor.\r\n\r\nIn considering the heavy duty of brick in boiler furnaces, experience\r\nshows that arches are the only part that ordinarily give trouble. These\r\nfail from the following causes:\r\n\r\nBad workmanship in laying up of brick. This feature is treated below.\r\n\r\nThe tendency of a brick to become plastic at a temperature below the\r\nfusing point. The limits of allowable plastic temperature have already\r\nbeen pointed out.\r\n\r\nSpalling. This action occurs on the inner ends of combustion arches\r\nwhere they are swept by gases at a high velocity at the full furnace\r\ntemperature. The most troublesome spalling arises through cold air\r\nstriking the heated brickwork. Failure from this cause is becoming rare,\r\ndue to the large increase in number of stoker installations in which\r\nrapid temperature changes are to a great degree eliminated. Furthermore,\r\nthere are a number of brick on the market practically free from such\r\ndefects and where a new brick is considered, it can be tried out and if\r\nthe defect exists, can be readily detected and the brick discarded.\r\n\r\nFailures of arches from the expansive power of brick are also rare, due\r\nto the fact that there are a number of brick in which the expansion is\r\nwell within the allowable limits and the ease with which such defects\r\nmay be determined before a brick is used.\r\n\r\nFailures through chemical disintegration. Failure through this cause is\r\nfound only occasionally in brick containing a high percentage of iron\r\noxide.\r\n\r\nWith the grade of brick selected best suited to the service of the\r\nboiler to be set, the other factor affecting the life of the setting is\r\nthe laying. It is probable that more setting difficulties arise from the\r\nimproper workmanship in the laying up of brick than from poor material,\r\nand to insure a setting which will remain tight it is necessary that the\r\nmasonry work be done most carefully. This is particularly true where the\r\nboiler is of such a type as to require combustion arches in the furnace.\r\n\r\nRed brick should be laid in a thoroughly mixed mortar composed of one\r\nvolume of Portland cement, 3 volumes of unslacked lime and 16 volumes of\r\nclear sharp sand. Not less than 2½ bushels of lime should be used in the\r\nlaying up of 1000 brick. Each brick should be thoroughly embedded and\r\nall joints filled. Where red brick and fire brick are both used in the\r\nsame wall, they should be carried up at the same time and thoroughly\r\nbonded to each other.\r\n\r\nAll fire brick should be dry when used and protected from moisture until\r\nused. Each brick should be dipped in a thin fire clay wash, \"rubbed and\r\nshoved\" into place, and tapped with a wooden mallet until it touches the\r\nbrick next below it. It must be recognized that fire clay is not a\r\ncement and that it has little or no holding power. Its action is that of\r\na filler rather than a binder and no fire-clay wash should be used which\r\nhas a consistency sufficient to permit the use of a trowel.\r\n\r\nAll fire-brick linings should be laid up four courses of headers and one\r\nstretcher. Furnace center walls should be entirely of fire brick. If the\r\ncenter of such walls are built of red brick, they will melt down and\r\ncause the failure of the wall as a whole.\r\n\r\nFire-brick arches should be constructed of selected brick which are\r\nsmooth, straight and uniform. The frames on which such arches are built,\r\ncalled arch centers, should be constructed of batten strips not over 2\r\ninches wide. The brick should be laid on these centers in courses, not\r\nin rings, each joint being broken with a bond equal to the length of\r\nhalf a brick. Each course should be first tried in place dry, and\r\nchecked with a straight edge to insure a uniform thickness of joint\r\nbetween courses. Each brick should be dipped on one side and two edges\r\nonly and tapped into place with a mallet. Wedge brick courses should be\r\nused only where necessary to keep the bottom faces of the straight brick\r\ncourse in even contact with the centers. When such contact cannot be\r\nexactly secured by the use of wedge brick, the straight brick should\r\nlean away from the center of the arch rather than toward it. When the\r\narch is approximately two-thirds completed, a trial ring should be laid\r\nto determine whether the key course will fit. When some cutting is\r\nnecessary to secure such a fit, it should be done on the two adjacent\r\ncourses on the side of the brick away from the key. It is necessary that\r\nthe keying course be a true fit from top to bottom, and after it has\r\nbeen dipped and driven it should not extend below the surface of the\r\narch, but preferably should have its lower ledge one-quarter inch above\r\nthis surface. After fitting, the keys should be dipped, replaced\r\nloosely, and the whole course driven uniformly into place by means of a\r\nheavy hammer and a piece of wood extending the full length of the keying\r\ncourse. Such a driving in of this course should raise the arch as a\r\nwhole from the center. The center should be so constructed that it may\r\nbe dropped free of the arch when the key course is in place and removed\r\nfrom the furnace without being burned out.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Typical Steel Casing for a Babcock & Wilcox Boiler\r\nBuilt by The Babcock & Wilcox Co.]\r\n\r\nCare of Brickwork--Before a boiler is placed in service, it is essential\r\nthat the brickwork setting be thoroughly and properly dried, or\r\notherwise the setting will invariably crack. The best method of starting\r\nsuch a process is to block open the boiler damper and the ashpit doors\r\nas soon as the brickwork is completed and in this way maintain a free\r\ncirculation of air through the setting. If possible, such preliminary\r\ndrying should be continued for several days before any fire is placed in\r\nthe furnace. When ready for the drying out fire, wood should be used at\r\nthe start in a light fire which may be gradually built up as the walls\r\nbecome warm. After the walls have become thoroughly heated, coal may be\r\nfired and the boiler placed in service.\r\n\r\nAs already stated, the life of a boiler setting is dependent to a large\r\nextent upon the material entering into its construction and the care\r\nwith which such material is laid. A third and equally important factor\r\nin the determining of such life is the care given to the maintaining of\r\nthe setting in good condition after the boiler is placed in operation.\r\nThis feature is discussed more fully in the chapter dealing with general\r\nboiler room management.\r\n\r\nSteel Casings--In the chapter dealing with the losses operating against\r\nhigh efficiencies as indicated by the heat balance, it has been shown\r\nthat a considerable portion of such losses is due to radiation and to\r\nair infiltration into the boiler setting. These losses have been\r\nvariously estimated from 2 to 10 per cent, depending upon the condition\r\nof the setting and the amount of radiation surface, the latter in turn\r\nbeing dependent upon the size of the boiler used. In the modern efforts\r\nafter the highest obtainable plant efficiencies much has been done to\r\nreduce such losses by the use of an insulated steel casing covering the\r\nbrickwork. In an average size boiler unit the use of such casing, when\r\nproperly installed, will reduce radiation losses from one to two per\r\ncent., over what can be accomplished with the best brick setting without\r\nsuch casing and, in addition, prevent the loss due to the infiltration\r\nof air, which may amount to an additional five per cent., as compared\r\nwith brick settings that are not maintained in good order. Steel plate,\r\nor steel plate backed by asbestos mill-board, while acting as a\r\npreventative against the infiltration of air through the boiler setting,\r\nis not as effective from the standpoint of decreasing radiation losses\r\nas a casing properly insulated from the brick portion of the setting by\r\nmagnesia block and asbestos mill-board. A casing which has been found to\r\ngive excellent results in eliminating air leakage and in the reduction\r\nof radiation losses is clearly illustrated on page 306.\r\n\r\nMany attempts have been made to use some material other than brick for\r\nboiler settings but up to the present nothing has been found that may be\r\nconsidered successful or which will give as satisfactory service under\r\nsevere conditions as properly laid brickwork.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOILER ROOM PIPING\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the design of a steam plant, the piping system should receive the\r\nmost careful consideration. Aside from the constructive details, good\r\npractice in which is fairly well established, the important factors are\r\nthe size of the piping to be employed and the methods utilized in\r\navoiding difficulties from the presence in the system of water of\r\ncondensation and the means employed toward reducing radiation losses.\r\n\r\nEngineering opinion varies considerably on the question of material of\r\npipes and fittings for different classes of work, and the following is\r\noffered simply as a suggestion of what constitutes good representative\r\npractice.\r\n\r\nAll pipe should be of wrought iron or soft steel. Pipe at present is\r\nmade in \"standard\", \"extra strong\"[76] and \"double extra strong\"\r\nweights. Until recently, a fourth weight approximately 10 per cent\r\nlighter than standard and known as \"Merchants\" was built but the use of\r\nthis pipe has largely gone out of practice. Pipe sizes, unless otherwise\r\nstated, are given in terms of nominal internal diameter. Table 62 gives\r\nthe dimensions and some general data on standard and extra strong\r\nwrought-iron pipe.\r\n\r\n                             TABLE 62\r\n\r\n           DIMENSIONS OF STANDARD AND

where noted are in inches.\r\n\r\nPipe Material and Thickness--For saturated steam pressures not exceeding\r\n160 pounds, all pipe over 14 inches should be 3/8 inch thick O. D. pipe.\r\nAll other pipe should be standard full weight, except high pressure\r\nfeed[77] and blow-off lines, which should be extra strong.\r\n\r\nFor pressures above 150 pounds up to 200 pounds with superheated steam,\r\nall high pressure feed and blow-off lines, high pressure steam lines\r\nhaving threaded flanges, and straight runs and bends of high pressure\r\nsteam lines 6 inches and under having Van Stone joints should be extra\r\nstrong. All piping 7 inches and over having Van Stone joints should be\r\nfull weight soft flanging pipe of special quality. Pipe 14 inches and\r\nover should be 3/8 inch thick O. D. pipe. All pipes for these pressures\r\nnot specified above should be full weight pipe.\r\n\r\nFlanges--For saturated steam, 160 pounds working pressure, all flanges\r\nfor wrought-iron pipe should be cast-iron threaded. All high pressure\r\nthreaded flanges should have the diameter thickness and drilling in\r\naccordance with the \"manufacturer's standard\" for \"extra heavy\" flanges.\r\nAll low pressure flanges should have diameter, thickness and drilling in\r\naccordance with \"manufacturer's standard\" for \"standard flanges.\"\r\n\r\nThe flanges on high pressure lines should be counterbored to receive\r\npipe and prevent the threads from shouldering. The pipe should be\r\nscrewed through the flange at least 1/16 inch, placed in machine and\r\nafter facing off the end one smooth cut should be taken over the face of\r\nthe flange to make it square with the axis of the pipe.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 2000 Horse-power Installation of Babcock & Wilcox Boilers\r\nand Superheaters, Equipped with Babcock & Wilcox Chain Grate Stokers at\r\nthe Kentucky Electric Co., Louisville, Ky.]\r\n\r\nFor pressures above 160 pounds, where superheated steam is used, all\r\nhigh pressure steam lines 4 inches and over should have solid rolled\r\nsteel flanges and special upset lapped joints. In the manufacture of\r\nsuch joints, the ends of the pipe are heated and upset against the face\r\nof a holding mandrel conforming to the shape of the flange, the lapped\r\nportion of the pipe being flattened out against the face of the mandrel,\r\nthe upsetting action maintaining the desired thickness of the lap. When\r\ncool, both sides of the lap are faced to form a uniform thickness and an\r\neven bearing against flange and gasket. The joint, therefore, is a\r\nstrictly metal to metal joint, the flanges merely holding the lapped\r\nends of the pipe against the gasket.\r\n\r\nA special grade of soft flanging pipe is selected to prevent breaking.\r\nThe bending action is a severe test of the pipe and if it withstands the\r\nbending process and the pressure tests, the reliability of the joint is\r\nassured. Such a joint is called a Van Stone joint, though many\r\nmodifications and improvements have been made since the joint was\r\noriginally introduced.\r\n\r\nThe diameter and thickness of such flanges should be special extra\r\nheavy. Such flanges should be turned to diameter, their fronts faced and\r\nthe backs machined in lieu of spot facing.\r\n\r\nIn lines other than given for pressures over 150 pounds, all flanges for\r\nwrought-iron pipe should be threaded. All threaded flanges for high\r\npressure superheated lines 3½ inches and under should be \"semi-steel\"\r\nextra heavy. Flanges for other than steam lines should be manufacturer's\r\nstandard extra heavy.\r\n\r\nWelded flanges are frequently used in place of those described with\r\nsatisfactory results.\r\n\r\nFittings--For saturated steam under pressures up to 160 pounds, all\r\nfittings 3½ inches and under should be screwed. Fittings 4 inches and\r\nover should have flanged ends. Fittings for this pressure should be of\r\ncast iron and should have heavy leads and full taper threads. Flanged\r\nfittings in high pressure lines should be extra heavy, and in low\r\npressure lines standard weight. Where possible in high pressure flanges\r\nand fittings, bolt surfaces should be spot faced to provide suitable\r\nbearing for bolt heads and nuts.\r\n\r\nFittings for superheated steam up to 70 degrees at pressures above 160\r\npounds are sometimes of cast iron.[78] For superheat above 70 degrees\r\nsuch fittings should be \"steel castings\" and in general these fittings\r\nare recommended for any degree of superheat. Fittings for other than\r\nhigh pressure work may be of cast iron, except where superheated steam\r\nis carried, where they should be of \"wrought steel\" or \"hard metal\".\r\nFittings 3½ inches and under should be screwed, 4 inches and over\r\nflanged.\r\n\r\nFlanges for pressures up to 160 pounds in pipes and fittings for low\r\npressure lines, and any fittings for high pressure lines should have\r\nplain faces, smooth tool finish, scored with V-shaped grooves for rubber\r\ngaskets. High pressure line flanges should have raised faces, projecting\r\nthe full available diameter inside the bolt holes. These faces should be\r\nsimilarly scored.\r\n\r\nAll pipe ½ inch and under should have ground joint unions suitable for\r\nthe pressure required. Pipe ¾ inch and over should have cast-iron\r\nflanged unions. Unions are to be preferred to wrought-iron couplings\r\nwherever possible to facilitate dismantling.\r\n\r\nValves--For 150 pounds working pressure, saturated steam, all valves 2\r\ninches and under may have screwed ends; 2½ inches and over should be\r\nflanged. All high pressure steam valves 6 inches and over should have\r\nsuitable by-passes. All valves for use with superheated steam should be\r\nof special construction. For pressures above 160 pounds, where the\r\nsuperheat does not exceed 70 degrees, valve bodies, caps and yokes are\r\nsometimes made of cast iron, though ordinarily semi-steel will give\r\nbetter satisfaction. The spindles of such valves should be of bronze and\r\nthere should be special necks with condensing chambers to prevent the\r\nsuperheated steam from blowing through the packing. For pressures over\r\n160 pounds and degrees of superheat above 70, all valves 3 inches and\r\nover should have valve bodies, caps and yokes of steel castings.\r\nSpindles should be of some non-corrosive metal, such as \"monel metal\".\r\nSeat rings should be removable of the same non-corrosive metal as should\r\nthe spindle seats and plug faces.\r\n\r\nAll salt water valves should have bronze spindles, sleeves and packing\r\nseats.\r\n\r\nThe suggestions as to flanges for different classes of service made on\r\npage 311 hold as well for valve flanges, except that such flanges are\r\nnot scored.\r\n\r\nAutomatic stop and check valves are coming into general use with boilers\r\nand such use is compulsory under the boiler regulations of certain\r\ncommunities. Where used, they should be preferably placed directly on\r\nthe boiler nozzle. Where two or more boilers are on one line, in\r\naddition to the valve at the boiler, whether this be an automatic valve\r\nor a gate valve, there should be an additional gate valve on each boiler\r\nbranch at the main steam header.\r\n\r\nRelief valves should be furnished at the discharge side of each feed\r\npump and on the discharge side of each feed heater of the closed type.\r\n\r\nFeed Lines--Feed lines should in all instances be made of extra strong\r\npipe due to the corrosive action of hot feed water. While it has been\r\nsuggested above that cast-iron threaded flanges should be used in such\r\nlines, due to the sudden expansion of such pipe in certain instances\r\ncast-iron threaded flanges crack before they become thoroughly heated\r\nand expand, and for this reason cast-steel threaded flanges will give\r\nmore satisfactory results. In some instances, wrought-steel and Van\r\nStone joints have been used in feed lines and this undoubtedly is better\r\npractice than the use of cast-steel threaded work, though the additional\r\ncost is not warranted in all stations.\r\n\r\nFeed valves should always be of the globe pattern. A gate valve cannot\r\nbe closely regulated and often clatters owing to the pulsations of the\r\nfeed pump.\r\n\r\nGaskets--For steam and water lines where the pressure does not exceed\r\n160 pounds, wire insertion rubber gaskets 1/16 inch thick will be found\r\nto give good service. For low pressure lines, canvas insertion black\r\nrubber gaskets are ordinarily used. For oil lines special gaskets are\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\nFor pressure above 160 pounds carrying superheated steam, corrugated\r\nsteel gaskets extending the full available diameter inside of the bolt\r\nholes give good satisfaction. For high pressure water lines wire\r\ninserted rubber gaskets are used, and for low pressure flanged joints\r\ncanvas inserted rubber gaskets.\r\n\r\nSize of Steam Lines--The factors affecting the proper size of steam\r\nlines are the radiation from such lines and the velocity of steam within\r\nthem. As the size of the steam line increases, there will be an increase\r\nin the radiation.[79] As the size decreases, the steam velocity and the\r\npressure drop for a given quantity of steam naturally increases.\r\n\r\nThere is a marked tendency in modern practice toward higher steam\r\nvelocities, particularly in the case of superheated steam. It was\r\nformerly considered good practice to limit this velocity to 6000 feet\r\nper minute but this figure is to-day considered low.\r\n\r\nIn practice the limiting factor in the velocity advisable is the\r\nallowable pressure drop. In the description of the action of the\r\nthrottling calorimeter, it has been demonstrated that there is no loss\r\naccompanying a drop in pressure, the difference in energy between the\r\nhigher and lower pressures appearing as heat, which, in the case of\r\nsteam flowing through a pipe, may evaporate any condensation present or\r\nmay be radiated from the pipe. A decrease in pipe area decreases the\r\nradiating surface of the pipe and thus the possible condensation. As the\r\nheat liberated by the pressure drop is utilized in overcoming or\r\ndiminishing the tendency toward condensation and the heat loss through\r\nradiation, the steam as it enters the prime mover will be drier or more\r\nhighly superheated where high steam velocities are used than where they\r\nare lower, and if enough excess pressure is carried at the boilers to\r\nmaintain the desired pressure at the prime mover, the pressure drop\r\nresults in an actual saving rather than a loss. The whole is analogous\r\nto standard practice in electrical distributing systems where generator\r\nvoltage is adjusted to suit the loss in the feeder lines.\r\n\r\nIn modern practice, with superheated steam, velocities of 15,000 feet\r\nper minute are not unusual and this figure is very frequently exceeded.\r\n\r\nPiping System Design--With the proper size of pipe to be used\r\ndetermined, the most important factor is the provision for the removal\r\nof water of condensation that will occur in any system. Such\r\ncondensation cannot be wholly overcome and if the water of condensation\r\nis carried to the prime mover, difficulties will invariably result.\r\nWater is practically incompressible and its effect when traveling at\r\nhigh velocities differs little from that of a solid body of equal\r\nweight, hence impact against elbows, valves or other obstructions, is\r\nthe equivalent of a heavy hammer blow that may result in the fracture of\r\nthe pipe. If there is not sufficient water in the system to produce this\r\nresult, it will certainly cause knocking and vibration in the pipe,\r\nresulting eventually in leaky joints. Where the water reaches the prime\r\nmover, its effect will vary from disagreeable knocking to disruption.\r\nToo frequently when there are disastrous results from such a cause the\r\nboilers are blamed for delivering wet steam when, as a matter of fact,\r\nthe evil is purely a result of poor piping design, the most common cause\r\nof such an action being the pocketing of the water in certain parts of\r\nthe piping from whence it is carried along in slugs by the steam. The\r\naction is particularly severe if steam is admitted to a cold pipe\r\ncontaining water, as the water may then form a partial vacuum by\r\ncondensing the steam and be projected at a very high velocity through\r\nthe pipes producing a characteristic sharp metallic knock which often\r\ncauses bursting of the pipe or fittings. The amount of water present\r\nthrough condensation may be appreciated when it is considered that\r\nuncovered 6-inch pipe 150 feet long carrying 3600 pounds of high\r\npressure steam per hour will condense approximately 6 per cent of the\r\ntotal steam carried through radiation. It follows that efficient means\r\nof removing condensation water are absolutely imperative and the\r\nfollowing suggestions as to such means may be of service:\r\n\r\nThe pitch of all pipe should be in the direction of the flow of steam.\r\nWherever a rise is necessary, a drain should be installed. All main\r\nheaders and important branches should end in a drop leg and each such\r\ndrop leg and any low points in the system should be connected to the\r\ndrainage pump. A similar connection should be made to every fitting\r\nwhere there is danger of a water pocket.\r\n\r\nBranch lines should never be taken from the bottom of a main header but\r\nwhere possible should be taken from the top. Each engine supply pipe\r\nshould have its own separator placed as near the throttle as possible.\r\nSuch separators should be drained to the drainage system.\r\n\r\nCheck valves are frequently placed in drain pipes to prevent steam from\r\nentering any portion of the system that may be shut off.\r\n\r\nValves should be so located that they cannot form water pockets when\r\neither open or closed. Globe valves will form a water pocket in the\r\npiping to which they are connected unless set with the stem horizontal,\r\nwhile gate valves may be set with the spindle vertical or at an angle.\r\nWhere valves are placed directly on the boiler nozzle, a drain should be\r\nprovided above them.\r\n\r\nHigh pressure drains should be trapped to both feed heaters and waste\r\nheaders. Traps and meters should be provided with by-passes. Cylinder\r\ndrains, heater blow-offs and drains, boiler blow-offs and similar lines\r\nshould be led to waste. The ends of cylinder drains should not extend\r\nbelow the surface of water, for on starting up or on closing the\r\nthrottle valve with the drains open, water may be drawn back into the\r\ncylinders.\r\n\r\n                                TABLE 64\r\n\r\n            RADIATION FROM COVERED AND UNCOVERED STEAM PIPES\r\n\r\n     CALCULATED FOR 160 POUNDS PRESSURE AND 60 DEGREES TEMPERATURE\r\n\r\n+---------------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n|+------+---------------------------+----+----+----+-----+-----+-----+|\r\n||      |                           |    |    |    |     |     |     ||\r\n|| Pipe |                           |1/2 |3/4 | 1  |1-1/4|1-1/2|     ||\r\n||Inches|   Thickness of Covering   |inch|inch|inch|inch |inch |Bare ||\r\n|+------+---------------------------+----+----+----+-----+-----+-----+|\r\n||      |B. t. u. per lineal foot   |    |    |    |     |     |     ||\r\n||      |  per hour                 |149 |118 | 99 |  86 |  79 | 597 ||\r\n||      |B. t. u. per square foot   |    |    |    |     |     |     ||\r\n||      |  per hour                 |240 |190 |161 | 138 | 127 | 959 ||\r\n||   2  |B. t. u. per square foot   |    |    |    |     |     |     ||\r\n||      |  per hour per one degree  |    |    |    |     |     |     ||\r\n||      |  difference in temperature|.770|.613|.519|.445 |.410 |3.198||\r\n|+------+---------------------------+----+----+----+-----+-----+-----+|\r\n||      |B. t. u. per lineal foot   |    |    |    |     |     |     ||\r\n||      |  per hour                 |247 |193 |160 | 139 | 123 |1085 ||\r\n||      |B. t. u. per square foot   |    |    |    |     |     |     ||\r\n||      |  per hour                 |210 |164 |136 | 118 | 104 | 921 ||\r\n||   4  |B. t. u. per square foot   |    |    |    |     |     |     ||\r\n||      |  per hour per one degree  |    |    |    |     |     |     ||\r\n||      |  difference in temperature|.677|.592|.439|.381 |.335 |2.970||\r\n|+------+---------------------------+----+----+----+-----+-----+-----+|\r\n||      |B. t. u. per lineal foot   |    |    |    |     |     |     ||\r\n||      |  per hour                 |352 |269 |221 | 190 | 167 |1555 ||\r\n||      |B. t. u. per square foot   |    |    |    |     |     |     ||\r\n||      |  per hour                 |203 |155 |127 | 110 |  96 | 897 ||\r\n||   6  |B. t. u. per square foot   |    |    |    |     |     |     ||\r\n||      |  per hour per one degree  |    |    |    |     |     |     ||\r\n||      |  difference in temperature|.655|.500|.410|.355 |.310 |2.89 ||\r\n|+------+---------------------------+----+----+----+-----+-----+-----+|\r\n||      |B. t. u. per lineal foot   |    |    |    |     |     |     ||\r\n||      |  per hour                 |443 |337 |276 | 235 | 207 |1994 ||\r\n||      |B. t. u. per square foot   |    |    |    |     |     |     ||\r\n||      |  per hour                 |196 |149 |122 | 104 |  92 | 883 ||\r\n||   8  |B. t. u. per square foot   |    |    |    |     |     |     ||\r\n||      |  per hour per one degree  |    |    |    |     |     |     ||\r\n||      |  difference in temperature|.632|.481|.394|.335 |.297 |2.85 ||\r\n|+------+---------------------------+----+----+----+-----+-----+-----+|\r\n||      |B. t. u. per lineal foot   |    |    |    |     |     |     ||\r\n||      |  per hour                 |549 |416 |337 | 287 | 250 |2468 ||\r\n||      |B. t. u. per square foot   |    |    |    |     |     |     ||\r\n||      |  per hour                 |195 |148 |120 | 102 |  89 | 877 ||\r\n||  10  |B. t. u. per square foot   |    |    |    |     |     |     ||\r\n||      |  per hour per one degree  |    |    |    |     |     |     ||\r\n||      |  difference in temperature|.629|.477|.387|.329 |.287 |2.83 ||\r\n|+------+---------------------------+----+----+----+-----+-----+-----+|\r\n+---------------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n\r\nCovering--Magnesia, canvas covered.\r\n\r\nFor calculating radiation for pressure and temperature other than 160\r\npounds, and 60 degrees, use B. t. u. figures for one degree difference.\r\n\r\nRadiation from Pipes--The evils of the presence of condensed steam in\r\npiping systems have been thoroughly discussed above and in some of the\r\nprevious articles. Condensation resulting from radiation, while it\r\ncannot be wholly obviated, can, by proper installation, be greatly\r\nreduced.\r\n\r\nBare pipe will radiate approximately 3 B. t. u. per hour per square foot\r\nof exposed surface per one degree of difference in temperature between\r\nthe steam contained and the external air. This figure may be reduced to\r\nfrom 0.3 to 0.4 B. t. u. for the same conditions by a 1½ inch insulating\r\ncovering. Table 64 gives the radiation losses for bare and covered pipes\r\nwith different thicknesses of magnesia covering.\r\n\r\nMany experiments have been made as to the relative efficiencies of\r\ndifferent kinds of covering. Table 65 gives some approximately relative\r\nfigures based on one inch covering from experiments by Paulding,\r\nJacobus, Brill and others.\r\n\r\n             TABLE 65\r\n\r\n            APPROXIMATE\r\n      EFFICIENCIES OF VARIOUS\r\n       COVERINGS REFERRED TO\r\n            BARE PIPES\r\n+--------------------------------+\r\n|+-------------------+----------+|\r\n||    Covering       |Efficiency||\r\n|+-------------------+----------+|\r\n||Asbestocel         |   76.8   ||\r\n||Gast's Air Cell    |   74.4   ||\r\n||Asbesto Sponge Felt|   85.0   ||\r\n||Magnesia           |   83.5   ||\r\n||Asbestos Navy Brand|   82.0   ||\r\n||Asbesto Sponge Hair|   86.0   ||\r\n||Asbestos Fire Felt |   73.5   ||\r\n|+-------------------+----------+|\r\n+--------------------------------+\r\n\r\nBased on one-inch covering.\r\n\r\nThe following suggestions may be of service:\r\n\r\nExposed radiating surfaces of all pipes, all high pressure steam\r\nflanges, valve bodies and fittings, heaters and separators, should be\r\ncovered with non-conducting material wherever such covering will improve\r\nplant economy. All main steam lines, engine and boiler branches, should\r\nbe covered with 2 inches of 85 per cent carbonate of magnesia or the\r\nequivalent. Other lines may be covered with one inch of the same\r\nmaterial. All covering should be sectional in form and large surfaces\r\nshould be covered with blocks, except where such material would be\r\ndifficult to install, in which case plastic material should be used. In\r\nthe case of flanges the covering should be tapered back from the flange\r\nin order that the bolts may be removed.\r\n\r\nAll surfaces should be painted before the covering is applied. Canvas is\r\nordinarily placed over the covering, held in place by wrought-iron or\r\nbrass bands.\r\n\r\nExpansion and Support of Pipe--It is highly important that the piping be\r\nso run that there will be no undue strains through the action of\r\nexpansion. Certain points are usually securely anchored and the\r\nexpansion of the piping at other points taken care of by providing\r\nsupports along which the piping will slide or by means of flexible\r\nhangers. Where pipe is supported or anchored, it should be from the\r\nbuilding structure and not from boilers or prime movers. Where supports\r\nare furnished, they should in general be of any of the numerous sliding\r\nsupports that are available. Expansion is taken care of by such a method\r\nof support and by the providing of large radius bends where necessary.\r\n\r\nIt was formerly believed that piping would actually expand under steam\r\ntemperatures about one-half the theoretical amount due to the fact that\r\nthe exterior of the pipe would not reach the full temperature of the\r\nsteam contained. It would appear, however from recent experiments that\r\nsuch actual expansion will in the case of well-covered pipe be very\r\nnearly the theoretical amount. In one case noted, a steam header 293\r\nfeet long when heated under a working pressure of 190 pounds, the steam\r\nsuperheated approximately 125 degrees, expanded 8¾ inches; the\r\ntheoretical amount of expansion under the conditions would be\r\napproximately 9-35/64 inches.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Bankers Trust Building, New York City, Operation 900\r\nHorse Power of Babcock & Wilcox Boilers]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFLOW OF STEAM THROUGH PIPES AND ORIFICES\r\n\r\n\r\nVarious formulae for the flow of steam through pipes have been advanced,\r\nall having their basis upon Bernoulli's theorem of the flow of water\r\nthrough circular pipes with the proper modifications made for the\r\nvariation in constants between steam and water. The loss of energy due\r\nto friction in a pipe is given by Unwin (based upon Weisbach) as\r\n\r\n                 f 2 v² W L\r\n        E_{f} =  ----------      (37)\r\n                     gd\r\n\r\nwhere E is the energy loss in foot pounds due to the friction of W units\r\nof weight of steam passing with a velocity of v feet per second through\r\na pipe d feet in diameter and L feet long; g represents the acceleration\r\ndue to gravity (32.2) and f the coefficient of friction.\r\n\r\nNumerous values have been given for this coefficient of friction, f,\r\nwhich, from experiment, apparently varies with both the diameter of pipe\r\nand the velocity of the passing steam. There is no authentic data on the\r\nrate of this variation with velocity and, as in all experiments, the\r\neffect of change of velocity has seemed less than the unavoidable errors\r\nof observation, the coefficient is assumed to vary only with the size of\r\nthe pipe.\r\n\r\nUnwin established a relation for this coefficient for steam at a\r\nvelocity of 100 feet per second,\r\n\r\n           /      3  \\\r\n      f = K| 1 + --- |      (38)\r\n           \\     10d /\r\n\r\nwhere K is a constant experimentally determined, and d the internal\r\ndiameter of the pipe in feet.\r\n\r\nIf h represents the loss of head in feet, then\r\n\r\n\r\n                       f 2 v² W L\r\n          E_{f} = Wh = ----------      (39)\r\n                           gd\r\n\r\n                       f 2 v² L\r\n               and h = --------      (40)\r\n                          gd\r\n\r\nIf D represents the density of the steam or weight per cubic foot, and p\r\nthe loss of pressure due to friction in pounds per square inch, then\r\n\r\n                    hD\r\n               p = ---      (41)\r\n                   144\r\n\r\nand from equations (38), (40) and (41),\r\n\r\n                    D v² L      /      3  \\\r\n               p = -------- × K | 1 + --- |      (42)\r\n                    72 g d      \\     10d /\r\n\r\nTo convert the velocity term and to reduce to units ordinarily used, let\r\nd_{1} the diameter of pipe in inches = 12d, and w = the flow in pounds\r\nper minute; then\r\n\r\n                    [pi] / d_{1}\\\r\n          w = 60v × ---  | ---- |^{2} D\r\n                     4   \\  12  /\r\n\r\n                  9.6 w\r\n     and  v = --------------\r\n              [pi] d_{1}^2 D\r\n\r\n\r\nSubstituting this value and that of d in formula (42)\r\n\r\n                 /      3.6  \\    w^{2} L\r\n   p = 0.04839 K | 1 + ----- |  -----------      (43)\r\n                 \\     d_{1} /  D d_{1}^{5}\r\n\r\n  Some of the experimental determinations for the value of K are:\r\n    K = .005 for water (Unwin).\r\n    K = .005 for air (Arson).\r\n    K = .0028 for air (St. Gothard tunnel experiments).\r\n    K = .0026 for steam (Carpenter at Oriskany).\r\n    K = .0027 for steam (G.

The size of the pipe at the\r\nhead of this column is that which will carry the required amount of\r\nsteam with the assumed pressure drop.\r\n\r\nThe table may be used conversely to determine the pressure drop through\r\na pipe of a given diameter delivering a specified amount of steam by\r\npassing from the known figure in the left to the column on the right\r\nheaded by the pressure which is the mean of the initial and final\r\npressures corresponding to the drop found and the actual initial\r\npressure present.\r\n\r\nFor a given flow of steam and diameter of pipe, the drop in pressure is\r\nproportional to the length and if discharge quantities for other lengths\r\nof pipe than 1000 feet are required, they may be found by proportion.\r\n\r\n                              TABLE 68\r\n\r\n                  FLOW OF STEAM INTO THE ATMOSPHERE\r\n __________________________________________________________________\r\n|            |             |            |            |             |\r\n|  Absolute  |  Velocity   |   Actual   | Discharge  | Horse Power |\r\n|  Initial   | of Outflow  |  Velocity  | per Square | per Square  |\r\n|  Pressure  | at Constant | of Outflow |  Inch of   |   Inch of   |\r\n| per Square |   Density   |  Expanded  |  Orifice   | Orifice if  |\r\n|    Inch    |  Feet per   |  Feet per  | per Minute | Horse Power |\r\n|   Pounds   |   Second    |   Second   |   Pounds   | = 30 Pounds |\r\n|            |             |            |            |  per Hour   |\r\n|____________|_____________|____________|____________|_____________|\r\n|            |             |            |            |             |\r\n|    25.37   |     863     |    1401    |    22.81   |     45.6    |\r\n|    30.     |     867     |    1408    |    26.84   |     53.7    |\r\n|    40.     |     874     |    1419    |    35.18   |     70.4    |\r\n|    50.     |     880     |    1429    |    44.06   |     88.1    |\r\n|    60.     |     885     |    1437    |    52.59   |    105.2    |\r\n|    70.     |     889     |    1444    |    61.07   |    122.1    |\r\n|    75.     |     891     |    1447    |    65.30   |    130.6    |\r\n|    90.     |     895     |    1454    |    77.94   |    155.9    |\r\n|   100.     |     898     |    1459    |    86.34   |    172.7    |\r\n|   115.     |     902     |    1466    |    98.76   |    197.5    |\r\n|   135.     |     906     |    1472    |   115.61   |    231.2    |\r\n|   155.     |     910     |    1478    |   132.21   |    264.4    |\r\n|   165.     |     912     |    1481    |   140.46   |    280.9    |\r\n|   215.     |     919     |    1493    |   181.58   |    363.2    |\r\n|____________|_____________|____________|____________|_____________|\r\n\r\n\r\nElbows, globe valves and a square-ended entrance to pipes all offer\r\nresistance to the passage of steam. It is customary to measure the\r\nresistance offered by such construction in terms of the diameter of the\r\npipe. Many formulae have been advanced for computing the length of pipe\r\nin diameters equivalent to such fittings or valves which offer\r\nresistance. These formulae, however vary widely and for ordinary\r\npurposes it will be sufficiently accurate to allow for resistance at the\r\nentrance of a pipe a length equal to 60 times the diameter; for a right\r\nangle elbow, a length equal to 40 diameters, and for a globe valve a\r\nlength equal to 60 diameters.\r\n\r\nThe flow of steam of a higher toward a lower pressure increases as the\r\ndifference in pressure increases to a point where the external pressure\r\nbecomes 58 per cent of the absolute initial pressure. Below this point\r\nthe flow is neither increased nor decreased by a reduction of the\r\nexternal pressure, even to the extent of a perfect vacuum. The lowest\r\npressure for which this statement holds when steam is discharged into\r\nthe atmosphere is 25.37 pounds. For any pressure below this figure, the\r\natmospheric pressure, 14.7 pounds, is greater than 58 per cent of the\r\ninitial pressure. Table 68, by D. K. Clark, gives the velocity of\r\noutflow at constant density, the actual velocity of outflow expanded\r\n(the atmospheric pressure being taken as 14.7 pounds absolute, and the\r\nratio of expansion in the nozzle being 1.624), and the corresponding\r\ndischarge per square inch of orifice per minute.\r\n\r\nNapier deduced an approximate formula for the outflow of steam into the\r\natmosphere which checks closely with the figures just given. This\r\nformula is:\r\n\r\n    pa\r\nW = ----      (49)\r\n     70\r\n\r\nWhere W  = the pounds of steam flowing per second,\r\n      p = the absolute pressure in pounds per square inch,\r\n and  a = the area of the orifice in square inches.\r\n\r\nIn some experiments made by Professor C. H. Peabody, in the flow of\r\nsteam through pipes from ¼ inch to 1½ inches long and ¼ inch in\r\ndiameter, with rounded entrances, the greatest difference from Napier's\r\nformula was 3.2 per cent excess of the experimental over the calculated\r\nresults.\r\n\r\nFor steam flowing through an orifice from a higher to a lower pressure\r\nwhere the lower pressure is greater than 58 per cent of the higher, the\r\nflow per minute may be calculated from the formula:\r\n\r\nW = 1.9AK ((P - d)d)^{½}      (50)\r\n\r\nWhere W = the weight of steam discharged in pounds per minute,\r\n      A = area of orifice in square inches,\r\n      P = the absolute initial pressure in pounds per square inch,\r\n      d = the difference in pressure between the two sides  in pounds\r\n          per square inch,\r\n      K = a constant = .93 for a short pipe, and .63 for a hole in a\r\n          thin plate or a safety valve.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Vesta Coal Co., California, Pa., Operating at this Plant\r\n3160 Horse Power of Babcock & Wilcox Boilers]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHEAT TRANSFER\r\n\r\n\r\nThe rate at which heat is transmitted from a hot gas to a cooler metal\r\nsurface over which the gas is flowing has been the subject of a great\r\ndeal of investigation both from the experimental and theoretical side. A\r\nmore or less complete explanation of this process is necessary for a\r\ndetailed analysis of the performance of steam boilers. Such information\r\nat the present is almost entirely lacking and for this reason a boiler,\r\nas a physical piece of apparatus, is not as well understood as it might\r\nbe. This, however, has had little effect in its practical development\r\nand it is hardly possible that a more complete understanding of the\r\nphenomena discussed will have any radical effect on the present design.\r\n\r\nThe amount of heat that is transferred across any surface is usually\r\nexpressed as a product, of which one factor is the slope or linear rate\r\nof change in temperature and the other is the amount of heat transferred\r\nper unit's difference in temperature in unit's length. In Fourier's\r\nanalytical theory of the conduction of heat, this second factor is taken\r\nas a constant and is called the \"conductivity\" of the substance.\r\nFollowing this practice, the amount of heat absorbed by any surface from\r\na hot gas is usually expressed as a product of the difference in\r\ntemperature between the gas and the absorbing surface into a factor\r\nwhich is commonly designated the \"transfer rate\". There has been\r\nconsiderable looseness in the writings of even the best authors as to\r\nthe way in which the gas temperature difference is to be measured. If\r\nthe gas varies in temperature across the section of the channel through\r\nwhich it is assumed to flow, and most of them seem to consider that this\r\nwould be the case, there are two mean gas temperatures, one the mean of\r\nthe actual temperatures at any time across the section, and the other\r\nthe mean temperature of the entire volume of the gas passing such a\r\nsection in any given time. Since the velocity of flow will of a\r\ncertainty vary across the section, this second mean temperature, which\r\nis one tacitly assumed in most instances, may vary materially from the\r\nfirst. The two mean temperatures are only approximately equal when the\r\nactual temperature measured across the section is very nearly a\r\nconstant. In what follows it will be assumed that the mean temperature\r\nmeasured in the second way is referred to. In English units the\r\ntemperature difference is expressed in Fahrenheit degrees and the\r\ntransfer rate in B. t. u.'s per hour per square foot of surface. Pecla,\r\nwho seems to have been one of the first to consider this subject\r\nanalytically, assumed that the transfer rate was constant and\r\nindependent both of the temperature differences and the velocity of the\r\ngas over the surface. Rankine, on the other hand, assumed that the\r\ntransfer rate, while independent of the velocity of the gas, was\r\nproportional to the temperature difference, and expressed the total\r\namount of heat absorbed as proportional to the square of the difference\r\nin temperature. Neither of these assumptions has any warrant in either\r\ntheory or experiment and they are only valuable in so far as their use\r\ndetermine formulae that fit experimental results. Of the two, Rankine's\r\nassumption seems to lead to formulae that more nearly represent actual\r\nconditions. It has been quite fully developed by William Kent in his\r\n\"Steam Boiler Economy\". Professor Osborne Reynolds, in a short paper\r\nreprinted in Volume I of his \"Scientific Papers\", suggests that the\r\ntransfer rate is proportional to the product of the density and velocity\r\nof the gas and it is to be assumed that he had in mind the mean\r\nvelocity, density and temperature over the section of the channel\r\nthrough which the gas was assumed to flow. Contrary to prevalent\r\nopinion, Professor Reynolds gave neither a valid experimental nor a\r\ntheoretical explanation of his formula and the attempts that have been\r\nmade since its first publication to establish it on any theoretical\r\nbasis can hardly be considered of scientific value. Nevertheless,\r\nReynolds' suggestion was really the starting point of the scientific\r\ninvestigation of this subject and while his formula cannot in any sense\r\nbe held as completely expressing the facts, it is undoubtedly correct to\r\na first approximation for small temperature differences if the additive\r\nconstant, which in his paper he assumed as negligible, is given a\r\nvalue.[83]\r\n\r\nExperimental determinations have been made during the last few years of\r\nthe heat transfer rate in cylindrical tubes at comparatively low\r\ntemperatures and small temperature differences. The results at different\r\nvelocities have been plotted and an empirical formula determined\r\nexpressing the transfer rate with the velocity as a factor. The exponent\r\nof the power of the velocity appearing in the formula, according to\r\nReynolds, would be unity. The most probable value, however, deduced from\r\nmost of the experiments makes it less than unity. After considering\r\nexperiments of his own, as well as experiments of others, Dr. Wilhelm\r\nNusselt[84] concludes that the evidence supports the following formulae:\r\n\r\n                    _               _\r\n      [lambda]_{w} | w c_{p} [delta] |\r\na = b ------------ | --------------- |^{u}\r\n        d^{1-u}    |_   [lambda]    _|\r\n\r\n    Where  a  is the transfer rate in calories per hour per square meter\r\n              of surface per degree centigrade difference in temperature,\r\n           u  is a physical constant equal to .786 from Dr. Nusselt's\r\n              experiments,\r\n           b  is a constant which, for the units given below, is 15.90,\r\n           w  is the mean velocity of the gas in meters per second,\r\n       c_{p}  is the specific heat of the gas at its mean temperature\r\n              and pressure in calories per kilogram,\r\n     [delta]  is the density in kilograms per cubic meter,\r\n    [lambda]  is the conductivity at the mean temperature and pressure in\r\n              calories per hour per square meter per degree centigrade\r\n              temperature drop per meter,\r\n[lambda]_{w}  is the conductivity of the steam at the temperature of the\r\n              tube wall,\r\n           d  is the diameter of the tube in meters.\r\n\r\nIf the unit of time for the velocity is made the hour, and in the place\r\nof the product of the velocity and density is written its equivalent,\r\nthe weight of gas flowing per hour divided by the area of the tube, this\r\nequation becomes:\r\n\r\n                        _           _\r\n          [lambda]_{w} |   Wc_{p}    |\r\na = .0255 ------------ |  ---------  |^{.786}\r\n            d^{.214}   |_ A[lambda] _|\r\n\r\nwhere the quantities are in the units mentioned, or, since the constants\r\nare absolute constants, in English units,\r\n\r\n           a  is the transfer rate in B. t. u. per hour per square foot\r\n              of surface per degree difference in temperature,\r\n           W  is the weight in pounds of the gas flowing through the tube\r\n              per hour,\r\n           A  is the area of the tube in square feet,\r\n           d  is the diameter of the tube in feet,\r\n       c_{p}  is the specific heat of the gas at constant pressure,\r\n    [lambda]  is the conductivity of the gas at the mean temperature and\r\n              pressure in B. t. u. per hour per square foot of surface\r\n              per degree Fahrenheit drop in temperature per foot,\r\n[lambda]_{w}  is the conductivity of the steam at the temperature of the\r\n              wall of the tube.\r\n\r\nThe conductivities of air, carbonic acid gas and superheated steam, as\r\naffected by the temperature, in English units, are:\r\n\r\nConductivity of air               .0122 (1 + .00132 T)\r\nConductivity of carbonic acid gas .0076 (1 + .00229 T)\r\nConductivity of superheated steam .0119 (1 + .00261 T)\r\n\r\nwhere T is the temperature in degrees Fahrenheit.\r\n\r\nNusselt's formulae can be taken as typical of the number of other\r\nformulae proposed by German, French and English writers.[85] Physical\r\nproperties, in addition to the density, are introduced in the form of\r\ncoefficients from a consideration of the physical dimensions of the\r\nvarious units and of the theoretical formulae that are supposed to\r\ngovern the flow of the gas and the transfer of heat. All assume that the\r\ncorrect method of representing the heat transfer rate is by the use of\r\none term, which seems to be unwarranted and probably has been adopted on\r\naccount of the convenience in working up the results by plotting them\r\nlogarithmically. This was the method Professor Reynolds used in\r\ndetermining his equation for the loss in head in fluids flowing through\r\ncylindrical pipes and it is now known that the derived equation cannot\r\nbe considered as anything more than an empirical formula. It, therefore,\r\nis well for anyone considering this subject to understand at the outset\r\nthat the formulae discussed are only of an empirical nature and\r\napplicable to limited ranges of temperature under the conditions\r\napproximately the same as those surrounding the experiments from which\r\nthe constants of the formula were determined.\r\n\r\nIt is not probable that the subject of heat transfer in boilers will\r\never be on any other than an experimental basis until the mathematical\r\nexpression connecting the quantity of fluid which will flow through a\r\nchannel of any section under a given head has been found and some\r\nexplanation of its derivation obtained. Taking the simplest possible\r\nsection, namely, a circle, it is found that at low velocities the loss\r\nof head is directly proportional to the velocity and the fluid flows in\r\nstraight stream lines or the motion is direct. This motion is in exact\r\naccordance with the theoretical equations of the motion of a viscous\r\nfluid and constitutes almost a direct proof that the fundamental\r\nassumptions on which these equations are based are correct. When,\r\nhowever, the velocity exceeds a value which is determinable for any size\r\nof tube, the direct or stream line motion breaks down and is replaced by\r\nan eddy or mixing flow. In this flow the head loss by friction is\r\napproximately, although not exactly, proportional to the square of the\r\nvelocity. No explanation of this has ever been found in spite of the\r\nfact that the subject has been treated by the best mathematicians and\r\nphysicists for years back. It is to be assumed that the heat transferred\r\nduring the mixing flow would be at a much higher rate than with the\r\ndirect or stream line flow, and Professors Croker and Clement[86] have\r\ndemonstrated that this is true, the increase in the transfer being so\r\nmarked as to enable them to determine the point of critical velocity\r\nfrom observing the rise in temperature of water flowing through a tube\r\nsurrounded by a steam jacket.\r\n\r\nThe formulae given apply only to a mixing flow and inasmuch as, from\r\nwhat has just been stated, this form of motion does not exist from zero\r\nvelocity upward, it follows that any expression for the heat transfer\r\nrate that would make its value zero when the velocity is zero, can\r\nhardly be correct. Below the critical velocity, the transfer rate seems\r\nto be little affected by change in velocity and Nusselt,[87] in another\r\npaper which mathematically treats the direct or stream line flow,\r\nconcludes that, while it is approximately constant as far as the\r\nvelocity is concerned in a straight cylindrical tube, it would vary from\r\npoint to point of the tube, growing less as the surface passed over\r\nincreased.\r\n\r\nIt should further be noted that no account in any of this experimental\r\nwork has been taken of radiation of heat from the gas. Since the common\r\ngases absorb very little radiant heat at ordinary temperatures, it has\r\nbeen assumed that they radiate very little at any temperature. This may\r\nor may not be true, but certainly a visible flame must radiate as well\r\nas absorb heat. However this radiation may occur, since it would be a\r\nvolume phenomenon rather than a surface phenomenon it would be\r\nconsidered somewhat differently from ordinary radiation. It might apply\r\nas increasing the conductivity of the gas which, however independent of\r\nradiation, is known to increase with the temperature. It is, therefore,\r\nto be expected that at high temperatures the rate of transfer will be\r\ngreater than at low temperatures. The experimental determinations of\r\ntransfer rates at high temperatures are lacking.\r\n\r\nAlthough comparatively nothing is known concerning the heat radiation\r\nfrom gases at high temperatures, there is no question but what a large\r\nproportion of the heat absorbed by a boiler is received direct as\r\nradiation from the furnace. Experiments show that the lower row of tubes\r\nof a Babcock & Wilcox boiler absorb heat at an average rate per square\r\nfoot of surface between the first baffle and the front headers\r\nequivalent to the evaporation of from 50 to 75 pounds of water from and\r\nat 212 degrees Fahrenheit per hour. Inasmuch as in these experiments no\r\nseparation could be made between the heat absorbed by the bottom of the\r\ntube and that absorbed by the top, the average includes both maximum and\r\nminimum rates for those particular tubes and it is fair to assume that\r\nthe portion of the tubes actually exposed to the furnace radiations\r\nabsorb heat at a higher rate. Part of this heat was, of course absorbed\r\nby actual contact between the hot gases and the boiler heating surface.\r\nA large portion of it, however, must have been due to radiation. Whether\r\nthis radiant heat came from the fire surface and the brickwork and\r\npassed through the gases in the furnace with little or no absorption, or\r\nwhether, on the other hand, the radiation were absorbed by the furnace\r\ngases and the heat received by the boiler was a secondary radiation from\r\nthe gases themselves and at a rate corresponding to the actual gas\r\ntemperature, is a question. If the radiations are direct, then the term\r\n\"furnace temperature\", as usually used has no scientific meaning, for\r\nobviously the temperature of the gas in the furnace would be entirely\r\ndifferent from the radiation temperature, even were it possible to\r\nattach any significance to the term \"radiation temperature\", and it is\r\nnot possible to do this unless the radiations are what are known as\r\n\"full radiations\" from a so-called \"black body\". If furnace radiation\r\ntakes place in this manner, the indications of a pyrometer placed in a\r\nfurnace are hard to interpret and such temperature measurements can be\r\nof little value. If the furnace gases absorb the radiations from the\r\nfire and from the brickwork of the side walls and in their turn radiate\r\nheat to the boiler surface, it is scientifically correct to assume that\r\nthe actual or sensible temperature of the gas would be measured by a\r\npyrometer and the amount of radiation could be calculated from this\r\ntemperature by Stefan's law, which is to the effect that the rate of\r\nradiation is proportional to the fourth power of the absolute\r\ntemperature, using the constant with the resulting formula that has been\r\ndetermined from direct experiment and other phenomena. With this\r\nunderstanding of the matter, the radiations absorbed by a boiler can be\r\ntaken as equal to that absorbed by a flat surface, covering the portion\r\nof the boiler tubes exposed to the furnace and at the temperature of the\r\ntube surface, when completely exposed on one side to the radiations from\r\nan atmosphere at the temperature in the furnace. With this assumption,\r\nif S^{1} is the area of the surface, T the absolute temperature of the\r\nfurnace gases, t the absolute temperature of the tube surface of the\r\nboiler, the heat absorbed per hour measured in B. t. u.'s is equal to\r\n\r\n      _                      _\r\n     | / T  \\       / t  \\    |\r\n1600 | |----|^{4} - |----|^{4}| S^{1}\r\n     |_\\1000/       \\1000/   _|\r\n\r\nIn using this formula, or in any work connected with heat transfer, the\r\nexternal temperature of the boiler heating surface can be taken as that\r\nof saturated steam at the pressure under which the boiler is working,\r\nwith an almost negligible error, since experiments have shown that with\r\na surface clean internally, the external surface is only a few degrees\r\nhotter than the water in contact with the inner surface, even at the\r\nhighest rates of evaporation. Further than this, it is not conceivable\r\nthat in a modern boiler there can be much difference in the temperature\r\nof the boiler in the different parts, or much difference between the\r\ntemperature of the water and the temperature of the steam in the drums\r\nwhich is in contact with it.\r\n\r\nIf the total evaporation of a boiler measured in B. t. u.'s per hour is\r\nrepresented by E, the furnace temperature by T_{1}, the temperature of\r\nthe gas leaving the boiler by T_{2}, the weight of gas leaving the\r\nfurnace and passing through the setting per hour by W, the specific heat\r\nof the gas by C, it follows from the fact that the total amount of heat\r\nabsorbed is equal to the heat received from radiation plus the heat\r\nremoved from the gases by cooling from the temperature T_{1} to the\r\ntemperature T_{2}, that\r\n\r\n          _                      _\r\n         | / T  \\       / t  \\    |\r\nE = 1600 | |----|^{4} - |----|^{4}| S^{1}  + WC(T_{1} - T_{2})\r\n         |_\\1000/       \\1000/   _|\r\n\r\nThis formula can be used for calculating the furnace temperature when E,\r\nt and T_{2} are known but it must be remembered that an assumption\r\nwhich is probably, in part at least, incorrect is implied in using it or\r\nin using any similar formula. Expressed in this way, however, it seems\r\nmore rational than the one proposed a few years ago by Dr. Nicholson[88]\r\nwhere, in place of the surface exposed to radiation, he uses the grate\r\nsurface and assumes the furnace gas temperature as equal to the fire\r\ntemperature.\r\n\r\nIf the heat transfer rate is taken as independent of the gas temperature\r\nand the heat absorbed by an element of the surface in a given time is\r\nequated to the heat given out from the gas passing over this surface in\r\nthe same time, a single integration gives\r\n\r\n                           Rs\r\n(T - t) = (T_{1} - t) e^{- --}\r\n                           WC\r\n\r\nwhere s is the area of surface passed over by the gases from the furnace\r\nto any point where the gas temperature T is measured, and the rate of\r\nheat transfer is R. As written, this formula could be used for\r\ncalculating the temperature of the gas at any point in the boiler\r\nsetting. Gas temperatures, however, calculated in this way are not to be\r\ndepended upon as it is known that the transfer rate is not independent\r\nof the temperature. Again, if the transfer rate is assumed as varying\r\ndirectly with the weight of the gases passing, which is Reynolds'\r\nsuggestion, it is seen that the weight of the gases entirely disappears\r\nfrom the formula and as a consequence if the formula was correct, as\r\nlong as the temperature of the gas entering the surface from the furnace\r\nwas the same, the temperatures throughout the setting would be the same.\r\nThis is known also to be incorrect. If, however, in place of T is\r\nwritten T_{2} and in place of s is written S, the entire surface of the\r\nboiler, and the formula is re-arranged, it becomes:\r\n\r\n                _           _\r\n     WC        |  T_{1} - t  |\r\nR = --- Log[89]|  ---------  |\r\n     S         |_ T_{2} - t _|\r\n\r\nThis formula can be considered as giving a way of calculating an average\r\ntransfer rate. It has been used in this way for calculating the average\r\ntransfer rate from boiler tests in which the capacity has varied from an\r\nevaporation of a little over 3 pounds per square foot of surface up to\r\n15 pounds. When plotted against the gas weights, it was found that the\r\npoints were almost exactly on a line. This line, however, did not pass\r\nthrough the zero point but started at a point corresponding to\r\napproximately a transfer rate of 2. Checked out against many other\r\ntests, the straight line law seems to hold generally and this is true\r\neven though material changes are made in the method of calculating the\r\nfurnace temperature. The inclination of the line, however, varied\r\ninversely as the average area for the passage of the gas through the\r\nboiler. If A is the average area between all the passes of the boiler,\r\nthe heat transfer rate in Babcock & Wilcox type boilers with ordinary\r\nclean surfaces can be determined to a rather close approximation from\r\nthe formula:\r\n\r\n                 W\r\nR = 2.00 + .0014 -\r\n                 A\r\n\r\nThe manner in which A appears in this formula is the same as it would\r\nappear in any formula in which the heat transfer rate was taken as\r\ndepending upon the product of the velocity and the density of the gas\r\njointly, since this product, as pointed out above, is equivalent to W/A.\r\nNusselt's experiments, as well as those of others, indicate that the\r\nratio appears in the proper way.\r\n\r\nWhile the underlying principles from which the formula for this average\r\ntransfer rate was determined are questionable and at best only\r\napproximately correct, it nevertheless follows that assuming the\r\ntransfer rate as determined experimentally, the formula can be used in\r\nan inverse way for calculating the amount of surface required in a\r\nboiler for cooling the gases through a range of temperature covered by\r\nthe experiments and it has been found that the results bear out this\r\nassumption. The practical application of the theory of heat transfer, as\r\ndeveloped at present, seems consequently to rest on these last two\r\nformulae, which from their nature are more or less empirical.\r\n\r\nThrough the range in the production of steam met with in boilers now in\r\nservice which in the marine type extends to the average evaporation of\r\n12 to 15 pounds of water from and at 212 degrees Fahrenheit per square\r\nfoot of surface, the constant 2 in the approximate formula for the\r\naverage heat transfer rate constitutes quite a large proportion of the\r\ntotal. The comparative increase in the transfer rate due to a change in\r\nweight of the gases is not as great consequently as it would be if this\r\nconstant were zero. For this reason, with the same temperature of the\r\ngases entering the boiler surface, there will be a gradual increase in\r\nthe temperature of the gases leaving the surface as the velocity or\r\nweight of flow increases and the proportion of the heat contained in the\r\ngases entering the boiler which is absorbed by it is gradually reduced.\r\nIt is, of course, possible that the weight of the gases could be\r\nincreased to such an amount or the area for their passage through the\r\nboiler reduced by additional baffles until the constant term in the heat\r\ntransfer formula would be relatively unimportant. Under such conditions,\r\nas pointed out previously, the final gas temperature would be unaffected\r\nby a further increase in the velocity of the flow and the fraction of\r\nthe heat carried by the gases removed by the boiler would be constant.\r\nActual tests of waste heat boilers in which the weight of gas per square\r\nfoot of sectional area for its passage is many times more than in\r\nordinary installations show, however, that this condition has not been\r\nattained and it will probably never be attained in any practical\r\ninstallation. It is for this reason that the conclusions of Dr.\r\nNicholson in the paper referred to and of Messrs. Kreisinger and Ray in\r\nthe pamphlet \"The Transmission of Heat into Steam Boilers\", published by\r\nthe Department of the Interior in 1912, are not applicable without\r\nmodification to boiler design.\r\n\r\nIn superheaters the heat transfer is effected in two different stages;\r\nthe first transfer is from the hot gas to the metal of the superheater\r\ntube and the second transfer is from the metal of the tube to the steam\r\non the inside. There is, theoretically, an intermediate stage in the\r\ntransfer of the heat from the outside to the inside surface of the tube.\r\nThe conductivity of steel is sufficient, however, to keep the\r\ntemperatures of the two sides of the tube very nearly equal to each\r\nother so that the effect of the transfer in the tube itself can be\r\nneglected. The transfer from the hot gas to the metal of the tube takes\r\nplace in the same way as with the boiler tubes proper, regard being paid\r\nto the temperature of the tube which increases as the steam is heated.\r\nThe transfer from the inside surface of the tube to the steam is the\r\ninverse of the process of the transfer of the heat on the outside and\r\nseems to follow the same laws. The transfer rate, therefore, will\r\nincrease with the velocity of the steam through the tube. For this\r\nreason, internal cores are quite often used in superheaters and actually\r\nresult in an increase in the amount of superheat obtained from a given\r\nsurface. The average transfer rate in superheaters based on a difference\r\nin mean temperature between the gas on the outside of the tubes and the\r\nsteam on the inside of the tubes is if R is the transfer rate from the\r\ngas to the tube and r the rate from the tube to the steam:\r\n\r\n     Rr\r\n    -----\r\n    R + r\r\n\r\nand is always less than either R or r. This rate is usually greater than\r\nthe average transfer rate for the boiler as computed in the way outlined\r\nin the preceding paragraphs. Since, however, steam cannot, under any\r\nimagined set of conditions, take up more heat from a tube than would\r\nwater at the same average temperature, this fact supports the contention\r\nmade that the actual transfer rate in a boiler must increase quite\r\nrapidly with the temperatures. The actual transfer rates in superheaters\r\nare affected by so many conditions that it has not so far been possible\r\nto evolve any formula of practical value.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Iron City Brewery of the Pittsburgh Brewing Co.,\r\nPittsburgh, Pa, Operating in this Plant 2000 Horse Power of Babcock &\r\nWilcox Boilers]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n                                                               PAGE\r\n\r\nAbsolute pressure                                               117\r\nAbsolute zero                                                    80\r\nAccessibility of Babcock & Wilcox boiler                         59\r\nAcidity in boiler feed water                                    106\r\nActual evap. corresponding to boiler horse power                288\r\nAdvantages of Babcock & Wilcox boilers                           61\r\n  Stoker firing                                                 195\r\n  Water tube over fire tube boilers                              61\r\nAir, composition of                                             147\r\n  In boiler feed water                                          106\r\n  Properties of                                                 147\r\n  Required for combustion                                  152, 156\r\n  Specific heat of                                              148\r\n  Supplied for combustion                                       157\r\n  Vapor in                                                      149\r\n  Volume of                                                     147\r\n  Weight of                                                     147\r\nAlkalinity in boiler feed water                                 103\r\n  Testing feed for                                              103\r\nAltitude, boiling point of water at                              97\r\n  Chimney sizes corrected for                                   248\r\nAlum in feed water treatment                                    106\r\nA.
